1 2018-02-15 23:59:19 I'm trying to get rid of this last bottle of olive oil and transition to whole foods only but I just slightly burnt the edges of some asparagus and now I'm conflicted
2 2018-02-15 23:59:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i live in eyebrow hair just wait for poor people of light.
3 2018-02-15 23:59:07 The UK economy is over $3Trillion and it's been a net importer of oil since 2005. Pick any number you want for North Sea oil contribution to that GDP, it's negligible. The economy of North of England DWARFS Scotland, Wales, Ireland combined. Nice try. Exceptionalism eh?
4 2018-02-15 23:59:06 The word democracy and Ethiopia like oil and water you cannot melt  together,by the way what mean by inclusive government?or transitional government?Are we already on that road?it didn't work.
5 2018-02-15 23:59:05 Somethings gotta give, the way skilled trades are going you start at less than someone dropping fries in oil.... that is just ridiculous!

7 2018-02-15 23:58:38 I'm not holding my breath. Maybe we should oil the guillotine, though.
8 2018-02-15 23:58:21 Elderberry, echinacea, ginger, and a couple drops of oregano oil (add it to something, not on its own).
Also, Sambucol
9 2018-02-15 23:58:12 No, no it does not.  Do you set out all your items and organize them before cooking?  I tend to do that a lot (put the oil next to the stove, and literally line everything up in the order they will go into the pan in).
10 2018-02-15 23:57:31 It would be, if there were a way to turn CPU cycles into payments that didn’t involve fleecing retail investors and somehow put the coil and oil output it was harvesting to some productive purpose.

35 2018-02-15 23:56:23 (like, idk, wanting to put oil in a pan, but using soy sauce instead. Which doesn't stop things from sticking quite so well )

42 2018-02-15 23:54:22 @SenatorBurr I just reviewed your Senate voting record for the past 6 years.  Just taking a wild guess that you’re in the pocket of insurance companies, the energy sector—especially oil/gas, and the NRA.  How far off am I?
43 2018-02-15 23:54:16 that oil change threw off my schedule
44 2018-02-15 23:54:15 Queens. Take your car to get an oil change if your King or pretend to be King won't take it for u. And, don't let the engine light stay on.
45 2018-02-15 23:54:11 No way oil lers get a team to take that...lol soshnikov playing bottom 6 on the leafs yielded a 4th rounder only
46 2018-02-15 23:53:55 isn't there some kind of lubricant that you can put on the bed? Obvs not like cooking oil but something made that you treat the bed with every few rounds of printing
47 2018-02-15 23:53:54 Unclear if it is calling for a review of each equity holding or of the FTSE Russell index with oil&gas, coal, and renewables components. The former seems extremely bold and would remove potential hedges on its oil revenue inflows. Latter, perhaps more likely.

55 2018-02-15 23:52:23 You walk in for a $25 oil change @jiffylube and somehow you end up with an $85 bill...
56 2018-02-15 23:52:04 What is genie oil? I looked at the # but don't get your point. 
57 2018-02-15 23:51:57 Not just NRA , BIG OIL, DRUGS, REAL ESTATE, LARGE COMPANIES, IE: ATT, APPLE THAT'S JUST THE START OF THE "A's".
58 2018-02-15 23:51:47 Another possibility might be Russia, China and NK take over US while its weak, divided, and our admin is looking the other way as they hack our power grids etc and US capitulates because that was the plan all along and eventually make us work for free. We have lots of oil too.
59 2018-02-15 23:51:33 You want to discover who was behind manufacturing "reformer" movement in Iran? Follow those American think tanks and oil companise includingAmericans who established NIAC et al, especially Parsi's mentor, aka 'the realists' in US.
60 2018-02-15 23:51:29 Y’all I just deep conditioned my hair & added grape seed & peppermint oil.... & low heat .... my head feels so fucking good
61 2018-02-15 23:51:28 I paid 90 bucks for an oil change today. It was the good stuff but I still feel bamboozled
62 2018-02-15 23:51:22 It’s so fitting that estrogen comes in this itty-bitty bright blue pill that melts in your mouth and tasted like sugar and carrots and T is a thick-ass oil that you inject into your body with a massive syringe
63 2018-02-15 23:51:21 Is Saudi Arabia trying to prove to OPEC that it has cut their oil production? At the same time, Saudi is manipulating by storage quantities of oil to be re-exported later?

67 2018-02-15 23:50:28 Oil pens are a new favorite of mine.
68 2018-02-15 23:50:10 Love it when the mechanic shows me the dip stick after an oil change. Like I don’t know what I’m supposed to be looking for 
69 2018-02-15 23:50:07 Yes.. was worried about lack of food.. or those slippery sardines thing in oil and you lot drinking all the booze 
70 2018-02-15 23:50:01 I bet they don't.
71 2018-02-15 23:49:47 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

75 2018-02-15 23:49:19 Staying off twitter until the people I went to high school with who never left home and believe It Works! works, and that they’re so fun and quirky for LOVING target and dogs, and think that they can cure the flu with an essential oil, stop trying to teach me about gun control
76 2018-02-15 23:49:16 What about @Total @eni @Statoil @Shell @WeatherfordCorp @qatarpetroleum @petrobras @exxonmobil ... would we hear their shouts? Let’s make our oil industry shouts again #SPE_Shouts

80 2018-02-15 23:48:37 Dawg I’m so late getting this oil change it  was due in December 
81 2018-02-15 23:48:37 I hear you. Headphones. Snuggle and bundle yourself up. Sprinkle peppermint oil. Put cheese in kitchen
82 2018-02-15 23:48:36 Car is getting its first oil change. A bit overdue at 3700 miles but hey at least it's free. Unfortunately I damaged the wiper blades trying to de-ice after The Snowstorm™, so those are getting replaced. Those won't be free. :P
83 2018-02-15 23:48:19 I feel you!! If I use coconut oil it will slowly take the bacteria away and it doesn’t smell so funky...

85 2018-02-15 23:48:00 Fortunately, the courts have ruled you don’t need a good reason to own a firearm. 

Not the Feds, the COTUS.

You could kill someone with a .22LR or .17HMR. No one would argue they’re  powerful firearms, which was the descriptor you gave.
86 2018-02-15 23:47:57 I think it depends on how much oil ya use and what sent. This is Jasmine, and it's very light.

90 2018-02-15 23:47:15 So you support the @bcliberals who put the wealthy and corporate money ahead of the people?

It has prompted me into trying to give up palm oil, which is surprisingly in almost everything! #savethejungle#notopalmoil#saveorangutans
95 2018-02-15 23:46:30 Drop my car off at Walmart with other stuff to do while Oil is being changed.. mind you I was told mine was next. I get in with mom to run some errands. Come back 40 minutes later and have her drop me off. She leaves. And I still wait.. 2 people ahead of me? What! How? I was next

99 2018-02-15 23:46:02 Cancel all permits to supply oil and natural gas to BC for “safety inspections”. Make it revolving for various pipelines and watch the losers scramble like cockroaches. Airplanes and buses and tankers have a hard time with no fuel.
100 2018-02-15 23:46:02 If you get the ‘perfectly pure raw coconut oil’ at least you know there’s nothing else in it, Holland and Barrett do the best one 
101 2018-02-15 23:45:48 Palm oil is unethically sourced. It destroys orangutan habitat.
102 2018-02-15 23:45:26 That’s the same as no oil drilling off Florida’s coast.
103 2018-02-15 23:45:26 Aaaahhh thank you!! I actually thought of peppermint oil earlier randomly so this makes sense hehe I’m definitely diffusing some now while I nap 
104 2018-02-15 23:45:25 Sadly, despite their cool name, Trans Mountain are not at all cool. They're a pipeline company who are trying to pipe more of Alberta's dirty oil through BC over the objections of the BC government and citizens, and are at the center of the BC/Alberta trade dispute.
105 2018-02-15 23:45:21 what's wrong  simple.  the nominal trade balance/ GDP misses the swing in the nominal and real balance in oil.  nominal oil deficit fell in 14 for obvious reasons but both real and nominal non-oil balance shoot up then. so net drag from trade in 14, 15 and 16 doesn't show
106 2018-02-15 23:44:58 Wonder why Alberta is not on this list? @RachelNotley @jkenney Gotta replace oil with another industry.

110 2018-02-15 23:44:24 Quite simple. You can draft an amazing kid but if he’s not developed properly he can be ruined. Put that kid on 25 different teams, he’s a player or star. Put him with the Oil. He’s done.  Look at the players the Oil give away only to play or even thrive on other teams.

Could be on the Isle of Faces. That's my bet.

132 2018-02-15 23:40:27 You sound pretty crude yourself. The US is poised to become one of the world's largest oil producers.

137 2018-02-15 23:39:38 Oh yes (ran out of room) anybody in Congress vested in said oil deal will become millionaires, billionaires because Congress is legally exempt from insider trading laws! Sweet Deal for GOP! Oil prices in USA will crash initially! Make Russia Great Again!
138 2018-02-15 23:39:29 Back in high school they used to call me “Extra Virgin,” which I always assumed was because I often brought my own olive oil to lunch with me. But no. Turns out it was a sex thing.
139 2018-02-15 23:38:33 I am not even going to read. UN free lies on Arab oil dollars and is the most bigoted racist organization in the world

141 2018-02-15 23:38:03 We need domestic oil.
142 2018-02-15 23:38:02 The oil ones are more intense. The ones that burn the actual herb are better (So I’ve heard). Pax is a good brand. They are the company that is spinning off JUUL which is all the rage with the young bucks.
143 2018-02-15 23:37:56 I am a supporter of our oil/gas industries, and would never object to reviewing government spending. The credibility of @jkenney or the #UCP would be much greater without having to use an impartial source to base policy positions. The Fraser Institute doesn't qualify. #AbLeg

148 2018-02-15 23:37:16 Yes you are right. It's closer 60000 gallons a month not a day show me about 3 ad a 2.8. So yes you were right but. So yes you were right but 99% of our crude oil goes to the states who are saying they're not going to do business with us anymore. Follow the Trump line You'll see

156 2018-02-15 23:36:45 13x more expensive per barrel than oil! When that story (the actual heist;I haven't seen the doc) came out, my romance brain thought it could be spun into a screwball rom suspense caper.

Thank you for being awesome World Oil!-Starchild143
162 2018-02-15 23:35:30 i use vitamin e oil w it
163 2018-02-15 23:35:28 For those upset the Oil didn't trade for Soshnikov, save your energy. We all know that this organization can't develop Russian or even European  players for that matter. Look at how they're messing with Slepy currently.
164 2018-02-15 23:35:23 maybe you should put some onions and garlic in with some olive oil, then strain them out
165 2018-02-15 23:35:22 Gareth is correct BUT the deduction AND offset system is too generous to the big companies. Oil and gas in particular

175 2018-02-15 23:33:25 Score more goaks than the Oil and they will win.

183 2018-02-15 23:32:07 Based on emission of co2 and extent of deforestation by soya, rapeseed and sunflower oil biofuels which are far inferior to those of palm oil, the EU should seriously consider early banning of biofuels from soya, rapeseed and sunflower oils and not palm oil.

190 2018-02-15 23:29:56 you should really research veganism more so you can actually have some background info before you make statements. having no vegan options at a wedding is like knowing someone is allergic to peanuts and cooking everything in peanut oil. an all vegan wedding EVERYONE can eat it!
191 2018-02-15 23:29:47 Going with your conspiracy theory then. US engineered a plan to hijack 4 planes. Crash them into WTC and pentagon so then giving them a long awaited for oppo to invade to persue there need for oil. Heavy price to pay for that. Don't think so

196 2018-02-15 23:28:13 I got a vegan baking zine at the fair and I'm just going through it now and I feel kinda let down all their substitutes are oil.
I mean vegan =/= health, but man, there is so much oil in all of these recipes.
197 2018-02-15 23:28:09 So because it not your contributors in oil and gas it’s bad? Lots of oil and gas teachers and labor unions donations for you also. Maybe that money could help fund #PEIA not just a political career!

209 2018-02-15 23:26:22 Just love going to get an oil change and finding out everything in my car is wrong.
210 2018-02-15 23:26:17 @AriMelber can you tell me is there any way to challenge Citizen United. Legislators no longer act on behalf of constituents. NRA, Koch Bros, big oil & big pharm write  actual legislation. It’s corrupt!
211 2018-02-15 23:25:53 The rapid development of buildings, and flood of people to the region has in the main arisen from oil wealth, so although there are new services etc, will be interesting to see how they function once that slows down. It's a little like Vegas. I'm not entirely convinced.
212 2018-02-15 23:25:46 It would be really nice if I had someone to take my car to get an oil change, be washed, and fill my tank
213 2018-02-15 23:25:44 Better or worse than the people that turned a blind eye to the club nonce? The Paedo Oil Torture Club does “Good work in the community”, ffs.

215 2018-02-15 23:25:18 @TheFive @realDonaldTrump   $.25Per gallon gas hike is great for inner structure roads now tell the oil companies to quit breaking it off in us and with the tax increase on gas it would be a great deal with the major tax cuts for corporations urge no reason gas should be as high
216 2018-02-15 23:24:58 Not sure if you’ve tried already but my cousin suffered terriblyyyy with eczema all over her body but coconut oil really helped clear it up, helped better than all the creamed she’d been prescribed
217 2018-02-15 23:24:43 productive things I need to do:

221 2018-02-15 23:24:10 Big mistake w/tankers full of oil as surplus not scarce so more tax for stock holders over family or relative value is a bunch of gay-fag action against humans of all genders.

222 2018-02-15 23:23:56 Thank you all for tuning into that short mechanics stream! Changed our front rotors, break pads, oil, and oil filter!

223 2018-02-15 23:23:53 Russia is giving North Korea oil by sea.  It is documented.  Trump says nothing about it.  Why, genius?
224 2018-02-15 23:23:48 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
225 2018-02-15 23:23:42 If I hadn't gotten the flu, I would have had an entire enjoyable day flying. I love being at the window and looking outside. But the doctor called and gave me the results of my flu test. Positive. And now I'm in bed. I blame the bulls for this, lol.

233 2018-02-15 23:23:01 1) Drain, cut into cubes, toss/coat in any spices you like, bake for 20 mins or fry for 5 mins. 2) or Marinade in a mixture of sriracha, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic powder, onion powder, bake for 20 or fry for 5

244 2018-02-15 23:21:21 And this so you all can have various solid forms of grease; soap, margarine, cookies. You all are as fully guilty of this devastating loss of a species as the loggers and poachers and plantation owners. You have all been informed of the results of your continued use of palm oil.

Don't cling to players because the Oil GM blew the Eberle and Hall trades.

271 2018-02-15 23:18:16 Crucial for people to understand, AB's fiscal challenges are hard *but not impossible* to solve. 

Hoping for oil prices to go up and take care of the deficit isn't the answer. Dealing with the problem through spending discipline is the far less risky approach.
272 2018-02-15 23:18:15 That’s actually false. Saudis murdered your people and you did nothing about it because you still wanted their oil.
273 2018-02-15 23:17:48 Ah, in that case I would say least corrupt is a useless measure given the minimum is so high, given all of the oil industry cronyism Bridges engaged in.

275 2018-02-15 23:17:31 Refined oil floats and is far easier to clean up. If it's refined into gasoline, it's more volatile, but spills evaporate or get burned off.

277 2018-02-15 23:17:08 Finally the audience member hits the nail on the head ! Education at secondary school, * Home Economics * , read your labels - don't buy products with ,* hydrogenated vegetable oil for example* ?

281 2018-02-15 23:16:03 @markhymanmd what are your thoughts on CBD oil?
282 2018-02-15 23:16:01 I agree with that sentiment. I sometimes wonder if the Tories are pushing for a hard n nasty Brexit so “the people” make such a fuss that they are “forced” to back down and stay in EU. Perhaps solely for the sake of keeping Scotland (sorry, Scottish oil/economy) in the union.
283 2018-02-15 23:16:00 *sigh* I’m missing Epic Party #2 tonight in Vegas but I trust Oil Country to celebrate properly on my behalf. Let’s get a win tonight, boys! #LetsGoOilers

Guess who has oil near us?

Can you imagine how gleeful the DT base would be if the US took over Mexico, stole its oil, and made its people work for free?

299 2018-02-15 23:13:37 apples and oranges comparisons. refined fuels for one city's needs vs a supply of bitumen to China and US. 

anyway it is all hypothetical right? starts with big oil allowing AB to start an embargo to begin with. do u think they will risk a quarter's profits? I don't.

361 2018-02-15 23:07:40 True.

I think the benefit of using Canadian resources rather than purchasing oil at higher prices from countries without the same environmental policies is massive though.  We can at least push for better environmental reclaimation.  Many other countries we buy from don't care.

408 2018-02-15 23:01:55 Humans are omnivorous after all. Meat, in moderation, is not bad for you & essential in early human development. However, current production of meat isn't scalable & if anything, has more in common w/ the oil industry (long-term impracticality). Smoking is directly unhealthy...
409 2018-02-15 23:01:54 @MotorWerksBMW I am really disappointed with you.  I tool a perfectly running BMW to get serviced for an ignition fault, you guys change the oil and gasket; a repair worth $2,000 and 8 days later my engine is seized?  If you love your BMW, stay away!  These people are worthless.

411 2018-02-15 23:01:42 maybe you shouldn't start wars in every country for oil in the first place and you wouldn't have so many veterans? hmmm tough life I know
412 2018-02-15 23:01:41 Oil is now almost irrelevant to the UK economy. For parts of last year the UK Treasury was effectively paying for it to be pumped out, as tax receipts turned negative!
413 2018-02-15 23:01:38 Did you have the oil changed recently? Maybe they spilt some oil or radiator fluid on your engine block.

422 2018-02-15 23:00:31 @mother3bears lit an oil burner with citronella oil (and using a citronella tea light) at 7 this morning. 
Repeated at 10.
Definitely fewer flies inside than y/day.
423 2018-02-15 23:00:06 a warm bath with some sandalwood oil perhaps?

425 2018-02-15 22:59:54 Getting an oil change and when I spelled my last name out (S-L-O-A-N) he was like “ha ha like Sylvester Stallone” 

No, not at all actually
426 2018-02-15 22:59:49 Ironic considering our Feminist Gov't closes down Cdn Oil projects that employ women because of safety to waterways, gender issues etc but ships in Saudi anti femanist regime oil up BC Coast and St Lawrence...Liberal Hypocrisy much?! Virtue signalling gone bad as usual.....
427 2018-02-15 22:59:46 My hair looked so nice earlier, but I added some oil to my hairand that’s not going too well
428 2018-02-15 22:59:30 And the pro-pipeline side should stay away from the oil lobby...bwah ha h ah ah aha couldn't even say it with a straight face. Derek, its funny how you have high standards from one side, no standards for the other.
429 2018-02-15 22:59:08 You really aren't a very bright bulb are you?  A country that has 1 major product has a major problem.  If oil prices stayed high, you wouldn't know where the country was located.  Or perhaps you still don't.
430 2018-02-15 22:58:35 He's getting skewered over at his twitter account. I am pleased to say I have done more part in it too. I am sick of these Wholly Owned Subsidiaries of the NRA, the health insurers, Monsanto and Big Oil. He's all of those things.

433 2018-02-15 22:57:59 Putting the lie to @TurnbullMalcolm trickle down snake oil!
434 2018-02-15 22:57:44 A 4th round pick isn't much to give. The adds of that pick turning into a legit NHLer are small. Adding an actual NHL player who's young for that price is a win. Exactly what the Oil should have done
435 2018-02-15 22:57:41 If you invest in oil then you would support it. You know how you Virginia politicians are invested in Dominion power. Still no word of tax savings being passed on to customers. But you’ll get a big return in stock!

438 2018-02-15 22:56:41 @IcelandFoods commits to reducing plastic waste but where is the commitment to reducing their use of #palmoil. They rate as one of the worst UK retailers on the use of sustainable and responsibly sourced oil. #bbcqt
439 2018-02-15 22:56:16 Wow. Guess they've never heard of the Hudson's Bay company. Or the Dutch East India company. Or United Fruit Company. Or Imperial Oil. Or De Beers. Or Blackwell Securities...
440 2018-02-15 22:56:06 Without oil your agricultural system fails,no exports ,no imports.And the thousands of chemicals that keep you alive,housed,clothed et al.
441 2018-02-15 22:55:26 Overturning "Obama-Era Regulations" is a dead giveaway that a candidate is bought by the anti-science oil cartel, greedy banksters who caused the 2008 crash, billionaire plutocrats, the NRA, the anti-woman theocratic zombie lobby and #TrumpCult apparachiks.

been buying them (even some lower quality names). I think these will be first to come back in energy bounce.
445 2018-02-15 22:54:49 How about we give back the oil and gold we stole from Africa and Middle East, then we can complain about foreign aid and charities who help the people we displaced through our greed #bbcqt
446 2018-02-15 22:54:33 Was it engine oil or petrol that stained the floor??
447 2018-02-15 22:54:28 I wanna paint but I kinda also wanna use oil pastels but then I have all my hw to do uh
448 2018-02-15 22:53:56 Is Pat Rabbitte working for an oil or gas company now #rtept
449 2018-02-15 22:53:55 Thank you. Have a good flight. I love flying. Lucky you :)
450 2018-02-15 22:53:53 There is no shipping back:: oil is destined for market in Asia:: 10 years they aren't going to want or need it.
Currently: 9 refineries in AB; 3 in BC
451 2018-02-15 22:53:53 @markdice is another shitball that has signed onto the right wing hate machine for a career. All he has to do is keep spewing virulent bullshit and his future is secured, unless an even worse oil slick of a human being outdoes him.
452 2018-02-15 22:53:40 (2/2) earth then you are intentionally looking away from what science has proposed. Since we have started using coal/oil, the earth’s average temperature has gone up more than in any time period in history.
453 2018-02-15 22:53:40 Argon oil! Before I showered I put a quarter size in my hair a few hours before I shower like once a week! Get a lil trim now and another in a few months etc. good luck!
454 2018-02-15 22:53:38 All of those statements apply easily to a lot of things we do.  It's just a matter of how extensive.  The resources used, if compared to the resources gained, is something to consider responsibly.  As long as we are using oil, it's far better to get it from Canada.
455 2018-02-15 22:53:36 I'd rather bury them in an oil drum than give em away...
456 2018-02-15 22:53:28 Oil change then home I go
457 2018-02-15 22:53:27 I’m thinking my next MFC show will be an oil show 
458 2018-02-15 22:53:25 You wouldn't recognize it anymore. Hell I don't. Too many people, too many cars, too many oil field vehicles on the road, too many oil field service companies and they drive like crazy people. You can't tell where Midland ends and Odessa starts, it's grown so much in between.
459 2018-02-15 22:53:21 No such thing as unlicensed dealer. If your a dealer that makes living from it you must have license.
460 2018-02-15 22:53:00 I need some of the BF hair growth oil!
461 2018-02-15 22:52:59 Imma Try This Egg Mayonnaise’s & Olive Oil On My Hair To Keep It From Breaking Off So Bad ... 
462 2018-02-15 22:52:54 WD 40 and a stiff scrub brush. Saturate & scrub, repeat. If heavy soak in vinegar overnight, scrub, repeat. When happy final rinse in vinegar, douse w/baking soda scrub, repeat. Rinse in water, spray w/wd40 (water displacing), dry w/rags. Immediately oil (I use used motor oil).
463 2018-02-15 22:52:54 Then get your oil and gas from the Middle East via “tanker”
464 2018-02-15 22:52:50 Yeah, I heard that on the radio today. He doesn’t even know the meaning of broken. I’ll introduce him to it.
465 2018-02-15 22:52:48 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
466 2018-02-15 22:52:47 #Turks #Turkey #Turkish gestures hand of friendship is fake. They LIE-Turks war warmongering saber rattling over gas and oil in #Aegean says it all!

467 2018-02-15 22:52:19 Try emu oil and vitamin e oil for very dry skin. Works like a dream for me, and is a lot more natural than some alternatives. 
468 2018-02-15 22:52:05 Nooooooooooo, I love my scented candles and oil burner...
469 2018-02-15 22:52:03 Oh no, hope you feel better!
470 2018-02-15 22:52:03 Just poured myself a drink of sunflower oil lol
471 2018-02-15 22:51:53 I love body and face oils like literally oil me the fuck up from head to toe 
472 2018-02-15 22:51:35 We're talking about oil and coal pollution, you should consider being apart of the solution not the problem.
473 2018-02-15 22:51:26 I made cedar wood, grapefruit & coconut oil bath bombs and they are soooooo relaxing.

475 2018-02-15 22:51:11 People don't need Uranium to survive. I'm not talking about replacing oil with water for energy. I'm saying water would have replaced oil as the reason to go to WAR with people, because it is required for human life. Uranium is not.
476 2018-02-15 22:50:57 Give me even one bit of evidence why this is “dangerous snake oil bullshit”. Give me a single study or fact. Anything that is vaguely scientific fact!
477 2018-02-15 22:50:50 Trump frauds Zinke, Pruitt and Ebell were put in place to destroy our environment and make America uninhabitable for innocent wildlife and our families all so oil and coal companies can make a dime.
478 2018-02-15 22:50:49 vitamin E oil is a blessing
479 2018-02-15 22:50:33 they fight just for oil that is the only think they care and ISIS too, OIL.
480 2018-02-15 22:50:33 Loss of habitat due to deforestation and land used for palm oil. Palm oil is in everything and this is the price.

482 2018-02-15 22:50:10 People are working on it. @JohnDeere had a working electric tractor prototype in 2016, and fertilizer is made using methane from natural gas and nitrogen from the air to make ammonia. We don't even use oil to provide the energy, we use the natural gas.
483 2018-02-15 22:49:59  My mama would’ve pulled out her oil and prayed that out of me.
484 2018-02-15 22:49:47 To meet world demand for oils and fats by 2030, expansion of soya, rapeseed, sunflower and oil  palm areas would be 30, 18, 4 and 8 million ha respectively but if oil palm is not allowed to expand, soya areas would need to expand by 70 million ha more.
485 2018-02-15 22:49:38 I am not sure....nobody seems to ban or speak out about Saudi's horrid practices.... I think it all comes down to Oil and Weapon sales imo...Even my feminist government praises Saudi regime and ignores their oil coming into my country while closing down oil projects....
486 2018-02-15 22:49:35 Not sure if it’s the meditating, the running, or the MCT oil, but damn, I feel good. Mentally and physically. If you want change, make it happen. Do it.
487 2018-02-15 22:49:26 locals will rub coconut oil on their skin and think theyre the master of skincare
488 2018-02-15 22:49:20 The SAMR model seems like more snake oil. Hope it gets critically reviewed for its validity.
489 2018-02-15 22:49:14 This child
comes in my room
and knocks over my glass jar of coconut oil like it's no biggie
It's time to throw some hands
490 2018-02-15 22:49:09 Actually it comes from sponsors and arsenal are sponsored by emirates. United gulf oil. Barca did dodgy shit with Qatar. Madrid by the government and Bayern own the bundesliga
491 2018-02-15 22:49:00 #Inwakanda there's a coconut oil water fall
492 2018-02-15 22:49:00 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
493 2018-02-15 22:48:55 When I used to get earache as a kid my grandmother would warm some olive oil up and pop it into my ear with some cotton wool.
494 2018-02-15 22:48:46 It is interesting to watch the hypocrisy of right wingers, who have spent the last two years screaming "Rachel hates oil!" now sputtering because she is fighting for a pipeline.
495 2018-02-15 22:48:41 Coconut oil is literally the best thing ever
496 2018-02-15 22:48:38 I, for one, would welcome a Canadian dog as world leader. Instead of a wall and oil pipelines, we'd get pretty parks and reforestation initiatives. Plus, he'd be really polite.
497 2018-02-15 22:48:15 okay. well check with your big oil overlords about shutting off the flow and get back to me.

 I'll source a shipment of fuel and arrange delivery and one of our many, many docks so our impacts are minimized...

500 2018-02-15 22:47:33 I live in Sweden which is super dry but I’ve been using Argan oil for a while now and it’s really helped a lot. I would leave a link but it’s probably just better for you to buy it off of Amazon or something instead of the place I use to reduce shipping costs
501 2018-02-15 22:47:32 fuck coconut oil
502 2018-02-15 22:47:23 1) Yep. 2) By all means join a well regulated militia 3)Indeed, that’s done by not giving people access to powerful firearms - in the same way we don’t allow people to have recreational plutonium. More gun deaths every day - how many is too many?
503 2018-02-15 22:46:46 Ecuador votes to reduce oil exploitation in Yasun
504 2018-02-15 22:46:41 In many places, local rice is now N13K & the reason why it is not N8K is:
(1) Nigeria was selling oil @ 100 / barrel &using the proceed to buy rice. Oil price has slumped.
(2) Local rice production needs to increase & many farmers are needed. You dont need a Govt licence to grow
505 2018-02-15 22:46:38 Must you play around with everything?

510 2018-02-15 22:45:53 I don’t even wanna know how much oil my car has lost since I’ve been gone 
511 2018-02-15 22:45:53 Noooo. I have an oncoming migraine today too. Peppermint oil and lots of water mama <3
512 2018-02-15 22:45:40 We r used to,we dnt panick
513 2018-02-15 22:45:33 Yeah, that was my immediate reaction. "Oh, this guy just wants some free press for his group". The fact that the guy from the group had never met the kid (and his group can't be that large) kind of puts the kibosh on the whole thing, I would think.
514 2018-02-15 22:45:32 Well I think the melting icecaps would object. Sure it is inevitable but we have expedited the process due to our usage of coal/oil
515 2018-02-15 22:45:09 NRA like big Pharma, big oil, etc pump too much money into Washington for the scum bags in office to ever really give a crap about the people they claim to represent.  They all o my represent who pays them off.

519 2018-02-15 22:44:45 I don’t know which is worse the gun lobby or the oil lobby.  I gotta go get an electric car and continue to not buy guns.
520 2018-02-15 22:44:43 When we went to war in Iraq ( undeclared so it wouldn’t be included in the budget and then had to be paid for) the Iraq oil was supposed to pay for the war.We are left with the 3D effects of this war Death,Destruction and Debt.
521 2018-02-15 22:44:36 I was just thinking and like it just crossed my mind that we actually use bare oil and gas on a daily basis, how has the oil not run out yet???
522 2018-02-15 22:44:20 Seems you keep repeating yourself. I worry about your mental health. Reminder: the conclusion of our conversation is we know exactly what needs to be done. But all the graph in the world won’t change your biased opinion in favour of oil.

529 2018-02-15 22:42:14 Again this is off subject, the subject is self determination and freedom of occupation of #Kurdistan for the #Kurds yes they can sell their OWN oil to Israel if they like just like many Arab countries that doesn't dubunk anything. You paid idiot @JaniceKortkamp try harder

542 2018-02-15 22:40:07 Your first mistake was calling it a tax. You might have done better with a system of GHG credits and debits. Credits for very fuel efficient vehicles for example and debits for gas guzzlers, etc,  credits for oil + gas exports, debits for oil + gas Imports.... Trust is gone.

548 2018-02-15 22:38:52 I witnessed a hit and run and the perps drove into the lot of Summit Racing in Sparks NV where I was buying oil for a rally engine... The recognized the car and told me, "you're not calling the cops" which resulted in the perps broken nose. There would have been... (1/2)

550 2018-02-15 22:38:44 Nope. Norway has oil & about 5 million people, Sweden 9 million. Norway is in good shape but Sweden taxes are astronomical. Failed State, not yet but they’re getting close and their citizens are furious. Their saving grace is their population. Try that with more than 320 million
551 2018-02-15 22:38:39 *Bring back oil
552 2018-02-15 22:38:31 Trillions of dollars in welfare to corporate welfare queens each year - Nestle, Coca Cola, Pepsi, prescription drugs, banks, oil, coal, Comcast, Apple, Facebook, Google, electricity, etc.  2002 Peter Arno Paying Twice for the Same Drugs Washington Post.

554 2018-02-15 22:38:29 TAUGHT MY GRANDMOTHER ABOUT CBD OIL TODAY 
555 2018-02-15 22:38:15 but do you drink the Oil or drizzle it on a Salad? Is the Oil gonna make me feel good?
556 2018-02-15 22:38:02 Nope. None of those. Only flew in H-3s and one ride each in a C-2 (cat shot off the E was interesting) and C-141 Clark (stop on Wake to fix oil leak) & on to Hickam. Almost forgot a ride in a C-118 from NAS North Island to Alameda to get on the E.
557 2018-02-15 22:38:02 Shoutout to the best bf for taking my car to get the tires rotated & the oil changed before my trip tonight. 
He's just the best sorry for the mush.

559 2018-02-15 22:37:46 I just spilled my belly oil on my table, now everything smells like lavender.

561 2018-02-15 22:37:28 Let me cook 4 you one day. My family is Italian and we used to have spaghetti night every friday with fresh parmesan cheese and olive oil and garlic bread and god I loved it

Finally, whats not talked about much is the fact that Iran didn't forsee complications from unfrozen assets.  Former Businesses involved in oil trade with Iran, hesitant to do business with Iran again, so technically unfrozen assets not returned 100% due to Iran's reputation
563 2018-02-15 22:37:11 I feel so refresh after putting Dabur Amla oil on my hair

568 2018-02-15 22:36:57 Dying means going out of business. It's not. Every country that has coal uses it. Countries in Europe don't have much coal or oil so their only options are Nuclear/Wind/Solar/Imports. Energy also is a lot more expensive there so solar has an easier time competing.

572 2018-02-15 22:35:50 Mustard oil is horrid!
573 2018-02-15 22:35:33 Do you want investors in oil and gas companies to loose money, let's flush 80 million dollars, next you'll tell seniors to invest in bitcoin.
574 2018-02-15 22:35:24 Your right to be in a well regulated militia?
575 2018-02-15 22:35:19 I tried to patent chemical free oil once. Patent office said vacuums already existed. Assholes.
576 2018-02-15 22:34:57 The @GOP and @realDonaldTrump only care about terrorists when they're brown, or parked over Exxon's oil.
577 2018-02-15 22:34:44 I’m at auto zone getting some oil for my car Folks like Babyy I’ll put your oil in 
578 2018-02-15 22:34:29 It took thirty years for me to realize there are other kinds of oil besides hash and two-stroke

582 2018-02-15 22:34:21 use a tea tree oil shampoo, then take vitamin C capsules crush them up to make a paste and let it sit on your hair like a mask for 30 minutes. my blue was just like yours and it took it straight out!!!
583 2018-02-15 22:34:20 I’m curious to know how his friends in oil feel about this.
584 2018-02-15 22:34:18 These positions can remain for a while. Euro and oil for example
585 2018-02-15 22:34:00 Its a GREAT burger (IMHO). It's hard to find vegan and Gluten Free. And the others all have oil in them (a no no for someone with a lot of inflammation!)
586 2018-02-15 22:33:55 Europe 1957-2018? Anyway, we're not Norway. Can't be, they're oil extraction costs for one are way cheaper than UKs. And beer is expensive!

588 2018-02-15 22:33:37 Due to its leaders taking blood money a government is systematically ignoring the slaughter of its own people. They have oil and WMDs. When will the US invade itself?
589 2018-02-15 22:33:26 So two weeks ago I had a gas and oil leak and now my brakes just went out....oh how I’m loving my car
590 2018-02-15 22:33:23 we are quite happy to take oil & gas from other countries at huge cost, but is that an Irish solution to an Irish problem, NIMBY ?
591 2018-02-15 22:33:08 Mayra got us an oil change. A synthetic oil change...I'm turned on.

593 2018-02-15 22:32:53 ~ he'd been working there for about two weeks now. One woman came in with an old red Corvette that needed an oil change, and she. Would. Not. Stop. Flirting. With. Him. It didn't bother him much at first, because the failed subtle ~

595 2018-02-15 22:32:45 If Olive Oil is made from olives, what's Baby Oil made from?
596 2018-02-15 22:32:43 Even looking at just the economics of it in isolation, the US knee jerk “drill baby drill” is just stupid. With the current oil glut, OPEC has lowered production to try to stabilize prices. In response, US frackers said “Hold my beer...”
597 2018-02-15 22:32:30 arnt.. Of they sell motor oil then they are responsible to recycling..
598 2018-02-15 22:32:30 More important is old oil that's ending up in the dump as DIY seek an easy way to dump it.. The sellers should be forced to recycle bins....
599 2018-02-15 22:32:04 Trump attacks the victims of pollution.  Pollution from coal, oil increases health care costs by trillions of dollars over time Medicaid, Medicare, health insurance companies.  IMF Externalities: Prices Do Not Capture All Costs. Asthma, black lung soaring, cancer, smog kills, etc
600 2018-02-15 22:31:53 I miss you too  and YES we do , just got my oil change so i can come too 
601 2018-02-15 22:31:47 White cronies have done this for a while, they all steal, kill or destroy or country & our people. From money laundering, banks stealing from us & then ask for help to Pharma, chemicals, oil Co. & the NRA have been aloud to do what they want with little fines

603 2018-02-15 22:31:24 Congratulations Liberia!  We need global attention to stop the world's remaining tropical forests from being converted to palm oil plantations, cattle ranches, etc.  The forests and the people that depend on them need protection.
604 2018-02-15 22:31:22 We work very hard to set and maintain the appropriate dialog tone, you killers.
605 2018-02-15 22:31:15 Getting an oil change in the old Toyota. 70's music playing. Mechanics singing along enthusiastically 
606 2018-02-15 22:31:07 I rally dislike the scent that’s “in” right now. Not only do I find it cloyingly sweet, but my lungs start closing up the moment I smell it. My scarf smells of motor oil from checking the trucks at work; I’d rather smell that than this scent.  #perfumes #scents #cloying #yuck
607 2018-02-15 22:31:04 Jamaican black castor oil!!! It's been saving mine like a mf
608 2018-02-15 22:30:58 How do you soak in tea tree oil if oil doesn't mix with water? Not trying to be a smart ass I just don't understand how that works
609 2018-02-15 22:30:47 They have good cash in, didnt spend it on acquisition, one of the rare to sell oil (big deal), awarded best customer service. The only news you need at this point is their next Q
610 2018-02-15 22:30:46 OIL DIFF: 3.06 -> 3.14
611 2018-02-15 22:30:39 Coming to get an oil change gives me so much anxiety 
612 2018-02-15 22:30:30 How about a 100% decrease in oil and gas subsidies.
613 2018-02-15 22:30:07 Oh, you don’t want politicians taking money from big oil, AARP, or labor unions either.   I’m on board.
614 2018-02-15 22:30:05 Some of our leaders are not leaders but prostitutes for oil/gun money.
615 2018-02-15 22:29:53 i have almost an 8th of weed with me inside my bag at work but i wrapped the container in paper towels and put it in a ziplock wt a bunch of drops of ylang ylang essential oil so this time it doesnt reek
616 2018-02-15 22:29:39 Why is olive oil so expensive 
617 2018-02-15 22:29:18 @GovernorTomWolf and @PA_PUC endanger us by allowing the recklessly sited Mariner East project that threaten thousands of Pennsylvanians.  Our lives, land, and safety are threatened for private gain.  PUC allowed public utility status from a 1930s CPC for an oil pipeline. #noME2
618 2018-02-15 22:29:02 One is a mono product economy that’s heavily import dependent and the other is a self sustaining one that produces most of its local demand/consumption. Are we really a leading African economy without our oil receipts?
619 2018-02-15 22:28:51 @LukeGromen we both know last week was not a crash, rather vol coming back. Im talking equity crash, oil blows up, oil exporters scramble for dollars, dollar shortage

621 2018-02-15 22:28:04 he said, an hundred measures of oil.  And he said unto him, take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.  16.7 Then said he to...
622 2018-02-15 22:28:00 If the NDP are going to build a better affordable province than let's build this pipeline so BC & Canada has money to build a better province and not send all our oil to the Americans at a 30% discount
623 2018-02-15 22:27:45 I really hope my hair oil came in the mail today.
624 2018-02-15 22:27:29 Lion Oil by Karben4 Brewing found at The Karben4 Brewing Taproom. Raise a glass of that tasty brew.
625 2018-02-15 22:27:09 I’m going next week along with oil change
626 2018-02-15 22:27:03 im the bitch that smells like green tea tree oil im class today bc I drenched my face in it to prevent period breakouts
627 2018-02-15 22:26:47 Maybe we should just get rid of lobbying and we wouldn’t have all these problems.. gun control, oil pipelines, net neutrality, big pharma etc.

But then again idk that much about how lobbying works so
628 2018-02-15 22:26:40 Salt water hot compress, tea tree oil should help bring the infection to the surface and kill the inflammation. !!!
629 2018-02-15 22:26:25 
630 2018-02-15 22:25:55 Con la sanción de la ley 27430 las empresas de transporte de carga dejan de computar contra IVA el 100% del impuesto al gas oil, pasando a ser sólo el 45%. Por lo tanto el 55% restante pasa directamente al costo logístico q querían bajar. Obviamente este costo subirá
631 2018-02-15 22:25:35 When taxes drop ... I need y’all being extra af buying oil ... tv, internet & phone from me ...

632 2018-02-15 22:25:34 Friday nights are for watching Grey's and putting oil in my hair and honestly I couldn't think of anything more fun 
633 2018-02-15 22:25:33 If I were a politician, I'd take money from all the gun lobbies, oil interests, big pharma, etc. and do the exact opposite of what they wanted me to do. Seriously, why doesn't anybody do that? I mean if you're not gonna have any integrity at least do something good, right?
634 2018-02-15 22:25:29 If we boiled him we could use the oil to run a car for 6 months 
635 2018-02-15 22:24:56 انقلع قلعه تقلعك
636 2018-02-15 22:24:51 I should rephrase - it is true the leader claimed he was a member. It is apparently false that he was actually a member.
637 2018-02-15 22:24:51 The exact same can easily be said for any oil or gas site where it comes onshore. Mayo proved that.
638 2018-02-15 22:24:43 Skin Food sheet masks are heaven for me. I either get the green tea, collagen, hylauronic acid, olive oil, or aloe ones
639 2018-02-15 22:24:43 I te tuatahi I was more interested in the dog sitting in their right. Oil - Guess I might need a bigger screen on my phone
640 2018-02-15 22:24:38 Why doesn't Alberta build a refinery at Ft McMurray?  Then ship refined oil and gas where they want.  That would mitigate all the danger of bitumen and dilbit crossing 1000 salmon bearing streams and rivers, the chance of polluting the water supply for million 1/2
641 2018-02-15 22:24:19 I’m using tea tree oil & the tea tree oil Dr. Bronners soap and it’s really lightening up my scars!
642 2018-02-15 22:24:13 so a woman Dr should be paid the same as a Man oil wealder?
643 2018-02-15 22:24:04 Oil? 
644 2018-02-15 22:23:41 put eucalyptus oil on his chest, it stops snoring (you can get it at any health food store or even at walmart i think)
645 2018-02-15 22:23:41 You know this reminds me saw recently ..on YouTube ...olive oil
646 2018-02-15 22:23:27 It definitely will, Moroccan oil is amazing but so expensive it’s a joke  I’m deffo gonna try the banana and honey mask
647 2018-02-15 22:23:17 بس بس تأمر 
648 2018-02-15 22:23:13 Gun oil.
649 2018-02-15 22:23:11 Rohingya have no crude oil, they are only interested in countries with crude oil..
650 2018-02-15 22:22:58 يارب
651 2018-02-15 22:22:48 We sell our raw logs to other countries to be milled. We sell our unrefined oil to other countries who then refine it and it's by products for a product that's worth more than the unrefined product. You're right, we're not giving it away, but we could do better. #morejobs
652 2018-02-15 22:22:32 機嫌悪くなるとすぐ課金するからストレス与えないで欲しいというか、イライラすると自分の機嫌が直るまで自分を甘やかし続けるクソだから
653 2018-02-15 22:22:30 There are quite a few nice ones! My favourite is the oil paint style brushes, they’re a lot of fun to work with. And there’s lots of custom brush packs up for download too!
654 2018-02-15 22:21:53 With the odd PFD alliances, think Dunleavy and Bill W., we need compromise. The industry doesn't compromise. That adds economic uncertainty. It will be hard to sell a status quo oil tax with PFD cuts in mix. I know you are a student of all this and have followed it a long time.
655 2018-02-15 22:21:43 I wanna go to bed but I gotta go to court & get an oil change now 
656 2018-02-15 22:21:42 في تاقات رح ننشر

658 2018-02-15 22:21:39 Also if you like curry's fry the meat and onions in oil with spices and garlic and then transfer to slow cooker with either tomatoes or coconut milk and whatever seasonings you like. Makes the best curry if left on a really low heat all day 
659 2018-02-15 22:21:36 ちょっと泣きそう。よかった。やっばいまじで泣きそう。
660 2018-02-15 22:21:07 The EU should ban biofuels from soya, rapeseed and sunflower oil as they are the major cause of deforestation reflected by their land use areas & low productivity compared with palm oil. Future rate of deforestation for these  oilseed crops will be even worse
661 2018-02-15 22:21:07 ラウンド取れた〜めっちゃ緊張したよ〜！！；；
662 2018-02-15 22:21:07 That’s all u need that and organic coconut oil and let it be
663 2018-02-15 22:21:06 Sabes que hace falta ??? Unas polainas en los tobillos para que el abdomen arda sabroso!!!
664 2018-02-15 22:21:05 Yup, I saw that right after I tweeted. Thanks!
665 2018-02-15 22:21:03 アイステ現地入りまで1週間とちょっとだよ。内輪作って、荷造りもして
666 2018-02-15 22:21:00 spare  25 cents  you will get it back with better roads.  Put tax on oil imports.
667 2018-02-15 22:20:57 I'm scraping some coconut oil out of a jar with a Tesco Clubcard. Is this adulthood?
668 2018-02-15 22:20:45 The Canadian marionettes(fem. puppets) whose strings are pulled by George Soros whose strings are pulled by the hidden hand are leading Canada to a demolition derby, province by province. The Indigenous string, the oil&gas string, the pipeline sting, the feminist string are taut.
669 2018-02-15 22:20:42 It's oil train money! Ha ha ha. Thank You BNSF and Warren Buffet!
670 2018-02-15 22:20:40 You signed your life away to kill people over seas for some oil. Ain’t nothing here to protect and you would’ve could’ve should’ve, it didn’t happen. What’s next
671 2018-02-15 22:20:34 ياشيخ طيييييييييير من هنا من له أطماع فيكم ولا في بلدكم  قال جزيره وميناء!؟ نفس الاسطوانة المشروخه سمعتها من اليمنيه في باريس اللي كانت بتجلطني حسبي الله ونعم الوكيل بس
672 2018-02-15 22:20:25 Yep, cops confirmed it a little while ago.
673 2018-02-15 22:20:24 ぱぴりあさん〜！！！
674 2018-02-15 22:20:16 I’m an aboriginal tradesman who is dependent on the oil to provide for my family & elders. 
Pipelines are safer than trucks & railway. 
We need to expand to foreign markets. Saudi oil is being refined in western Canada. Our oil is not on par with WTI stock exchange levels. Peace.
675 2018-02-15 22:20:15 Not true.  You add the chane in the price of oil
676 2018-02-15 22:20:10 Lol Jiffy Lube hooked it up with a coupon on the tweet about changing the oil of my car 
677 2018-02-15 22:19:54 Actually no, the police there have conclusively stated it was a hoax and the shooter is not affiliated.

682 2018-02-15 22:19:14 Also I would steer away from the flavored oil, and only buy organic.

685 2018-02-15 22:18:58 2.5 TCF of gas targeted in South Disouq with the structure de-risked following the discovery at the SD-1X well in 2017. And 100 million barrels of oil! I expect to double my money here in the next few months.

687 2018-02-15 22:18:50 Omg I did exactly this in my early twenties. Those wipes suck. How is there a market for them. Now I am 28 I use two water cleansers, facial oil, toner, night cream, day cream, hydrochloric acid and anti-aging crap. I assume I have to add more things as time goes on.
688 2018-02-15 22:18:49 Nobody's really sure what the truth is, but it seems like the militia guy is known for being an attention hog, and his group is based like 400 miles away. So while I think it's true that he claimed Cruz was a member, people are skeptical.

692 2018-02-15 22:18:36 Japan bombed Pearl Harbor because America was cutting off oil to Japan trying to economically destroy it. They had no other alternative. They are doing the same thing to North Korea. Also America knew the Japanese were coming and they allowed them to do it as justification.

695 2018-02-15 22:18:28 NRA is nothing but a marketing tool for gun manufacturers. Marketing for gun sales of their investors, just like the Koch's with their lobbying efforts for marketing of big oil/ fracking investments that contribute to an out of date energy resource.  All about big money, only.

704 2018-02-15 22:17:09 There would have been an election in 1980 anyway which no doubt the Tories would have won. BNOC wasn't set up to create an oil fund. Its purpose was to stabilise oil supplies and this lost it money hence the privatisation to Britoil.

723 2018-02-15 22:13:49 SB 21 was approved in FY 2014, when production averaged 530K. Last year production averaged 526K. Oil flow is stabilized, maybe, but not up. (Increases are required to offset normal fields decline rates, but that is not the basis on which SB 21 was oversold.)

831 2018-02-15 21:57:19 Loads of oil off the coast near Dalkey!!! RBB definitely won’t have us drilling for oil there. Maybe that’s the reason for his save the planet mood! #primetime
832 2018-02-15 21:57:16 Maybe teach them not to let America and Britain steal all its oil .
833 2018-02-15 21:57:02 A BOILING vat of hot oil is a cure for his issues. Slowly lower him into the oil feet first. That will cure him in about 12 hours. He can reflect on what he committed to these students. Broadcast on Free tv so others will know what's In store for them if they have any ideas.
834 2018-02-15 21:56:58 Irish solutions

 No nuclear power but we will take it from elsewhere.

No more oil/gas exploration but we will take it from other countries.

Opposition and independents can change their minds depending on how the wind blows. 

Maybe that is real wind power

835 2018-02-15 21:56:56 They knew.they knew it's Government forces.didn't stop them to bomb Syrian Government troops.The SDF control the oil there in the region.We should ask why the massive firepower to take out legitimate government troops
836 2018-02-15 21:56:42 June 2016 1 46 today 1.41 raw materials priced in dollars inc oil will help inflation to fall pre vote predictions failed therefore post leave predictions have no credibility weak £ against € is to our advantage & increases competitiveness
837 2018-02-15 21:56:35 Pat Rabitte..former Stalinist...current lobbyist for big oil and gas....but a consistent piece of shite
838 2018-02-15 21:56:33 Hilarious that this AAA/PBP Bill comes from a group that in 2011 was promising that Atlantic Oil could create €25bn in resources for the taxpayer and should form the backbone of Ireland's industrial strategy #rtept

841 2018-02-15 21:55:20 US Military industrial complex uses WAY WAY more planet polluting oil energy invading other countries so it can get more oil to invade even more countries and kill people.

Bitcoin runs on mostly cheap eco geothermal or hydro and will eventually oust energy using banksters.
842 2018-02-15 21:55:15 I might be wrong Duncan, but I believe there is nothing for you to learn here. I have some oil I just extracted from this snake though... want some?
843 2018-02-15 21:54:48 Federal regulators lack adequate data to investigate potential

So i guess PES Will have to pay their RFS requirements? #OOTT #oil
844 2018-02-15 21:54:47 I am genuinely shocked and saddened that Pat Rabbitte has come on #rtept to say we should still drill for oil and gas. @labour supported the #ClimateEmergency Bill. @AlexWhiteSC? @ivanabacik? @seansherlocktd? @damianobroin?
845 2018-02-15 21:54:45 Killed by the USA only to protect the oil fields under SDF control which the government and soldiers of Assad wanted back peacefully.SDF refused and a battle ensued and the USAF bombed them to protect oil.Blood for oil

Eat food (any kind u want) as long as it isn't much and as long as it doesn't have a lot of oil. Don't drink coke. U can drink juice.
But sleeping early + exercising are the most important

857 2018-02-15 21:52:58 *Your coconut oil... I seen him using that Cantu creme too!
858 2018-02-15 21:52:48 You are right.  And the money going into that pipeline could be used to transition people currently employed in the gas/oil business, into new jobs.
859 2018-02-15 21:52:42 In your mind, why doesn't it make sense that the oilsands can be made to be better off after humans are done with a region?  The oilsands are a contamination of oil in the environment.  Animals certainly aren't better off in its natural state.
860 2018-02-15 21:52:07 I have made the establishment very mad for four years protecting Arctic national wildlife refuge The worlds largest untouched sanctuary on the planet from gas & oil drilling As well as protecting Bristol Bay from the pebble mine I pissed off the Koch brothers for 30 years
861 2018-02-15 21:52:07 From zero  100 yrs ago,  areas for soya, rapeseed, sunflower & oil palm for 2016 are respectively 120.2, 33.2, 24.9 and 18.1 million ha with production of 51.5, 24.9, 16.4 & 58.3 million t respectively. Oil palm uses the least land but produces the most oil.
862 2018-02-15 21:52:01 To broaden out a bit.  BO Stocks are lower than last year, dollar is down, crude oil is up, beans and meal are up from this time last year.  Yet bean oil is down?
863 2018-02-15 21:51:57 In studio now @RBoydBarrett and former Min. for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources Pat Rabbitte discuss a ban on drilling for gas and oil in Irish waters. #rtept
864 2018-02-15 21:51:56 My window once went up really slow and they had to oil it. I think yours wants nothing to do with being open or shut.
865 2018-02-15 21:51:43 simultaneously claiming some rotten moral high ground, screaming that we will police the world, while turning a blind eye to genocide and injustice that doesn't happen to coincide with oil reserves.
866 2018-02-15 21:51:34 Myt just shine my skin in coconut oil, throw my dashiki on and head out to the cinema tonight. Front lady betta not ask me what movie I'm  here to watch lol
867 2018-02-15 21:51:29 So we won’t explore for Irish oil but we’ll continue to buy foreign oil while feeling very pure about ourselves indeed. Well that isn’t at all like outsourcing abortion to Perfidious Albion while saying pious decades of the Rosary at home here in Holy Catholic Ireland. #rtept
868 2018-02-15 21:51:24 Coal, oil and gas are finite resources. They are limited. Let's look to renewables. #rtept

878 2018-02-15 21:49:47 No I’m pretty aware of how it works, such as that HRC benefits from keeping things the way they are, here funders are Wall Street, healthcare companies, oil companies, hence why she almost no progressive views and does not promote progressive policies

892 2018-02-15 21:46:59 it wouldn't be bitumen, and the refinery would create permanent jobs, and the oil could stay in canada and benefit people here.
893 2018-02-15 21:46:49 Fresh or dried. You’re going to use twice as much fresh, and greater risk of burning in a hot oil application.
894 2018-02-15 21:46:41 I haven't had it, but If I can't feel my arteries clogging from the oil idk if I want it

908 2018-02-15 21:43:43 Typical RTÉ propaganda. Just look at Kinsale & Corrib gas fields. NOT A CENT made by the state, the EU "forced" them to sell it to us at "market prices". We still pay taxes beyond belief. Finding oil or more gas would be no different for the average Irish person #FGFFStyle #rtept
909 2018-02-15 21:43:33 #rtept Even if we all go green, We'll still need some oil and gas. Mad decision to close off the option to develop possible resources at our doorstep for the good of our citizens I.e. Not sign the rites away to big oil companies
910 2018-02-15 21:43:33 this oil change is only $25? Basically paying $5 for labor
911 2018-02-15 21:43:24 When I was in college my ecology prof told me we would run out of oil in thirty years.

916 2018-02-15 21:43:06 It's because some of us are taking a compromise position. We aren't so worried about a pipeline (it IS the safest way to transport oil), but more concerned about a tanker spill on our coastline. Dilbit don't float, it sinks and will never be cleaned up.

Zero pretense of impartiality in their 'findings'. Pick anyone else!
926 2018-02-15 21:41:40 We want to use our potential oil and Gas fields if we pay through the nose for it and let big oil companies keep 99.9999% of the profits and pay no tax on it,   other than that,  we don't want to know    #RTEpt

1020 2018-02-15 21:29:13 Our country has the stupidest pipeline  policy in the entire world. Not only would TM, Energy East and Northern Gateway take our oil to world markets, but would free up rail for grains and mining.

1026 2018-02-15 21:28:23 if @OilsandsAction gave a shit about jobs, you'd want oil kept in our country and refined here. Why are you shipping a raw product to buy back, where we take the risk and others profit?
1027 2018-02-15 21:27:47 I assume you are trying to figure out a way to make money off of the census for big oil or your other wealthy GOP donors without regard for any of these Native American people or any others. Like you did when you traded your vote on the tax bill for oil.

1104 2018-02-15 21:15:23 ANY assistance given to Albert oil & gas only delays that province's vitally needed change to a 21st century diversified economy and therefore harms Alberta and its people. #abpoli
1105 2018-02-15 21:15:21 This is the biggest crock of shit I’ve read on Twitter I’ve read today, and that’s saying something.
1106 2018-02-15 21:15:11 What is regularly? Like whenever I get oil changes? But really thanks again for fixing my tire!!!
1107 2018-02-15 21:15:09 If the head scratching continues, you might have nits. Use minty tea tree oil and a fine comb to get them out.
1108 2018-02-15 21:14:57 I just treated to my car to an oil change and all new tires  happy valentines
1109 2018-02-15 21:14:54 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell new planes etc, and it'll leak to us plebs 
1110 2018-02-15 21:14:51 Pistola. Best one to play on drums too IMO.

Oil and Water and Paper Shoes are underrated too.
1111 2018-02-15 21:14:48 Best to save him for the oil...
1112 2018-02-15 21:14:43 Thankyou for ur clarity I really do trust ur word. I have returned to peanut butter in sustainable palm oil. All my African pals say palm oil esp red one is a staple used by granny & healthy! Whats ur verdict on rapeseed oil? And also mustard oil which was used by north indians
1113 2018-02-15 21:14:42 I used coconut oil to get it off and my lips didn’t get stained!!!
1114 2018-02-15 21:14:29 Just drink olive oil or suntin.
1115 2018-02-15 21:14:12 Hey, @Walmart. Why is it that after your auto techs change my oil the oil pan is dented and the drain plug can't come out?
1116 2018-02-15 21:14:07 just dabbed the oil off my salt and chilli tofu, i'm a true skinny legend
1117 2018-02-15 21:13:59 Nje! Lolu and Ceec on the same sentence is just disaster, who will vote for amazi no oil hahahaha talk abt witchcraft!
1118 2018-02-15 21:13:20 Well, I am starting to read the great book about Marc Rich - the greatest Oilman, the Kind of #Oil and perfect businessman. There would be many citations from that book
1119 2018-02-15 21:13:02 Quit promoting your agenda, I was talking about cars replacing horse & carriage at the turn of the century progress today is moving past oil & fracking, & no we are not returning to horse & carriage
1120 2018-02-15 21:12:41 Oil Change 
1121 2018-02-15 21:12:36  oil/pen set for sale. 

DM me for details.
1122 2018-02-15 21:12:26 They grow everywhere here. I'll try the oil though, I've tried all sorts of repellents, one more won't hurt.
1123 2018-02-15 21:12:17 EZ shares +0.6%, US shares +1.2% (+7.2% from last wks low). US 10 yr yld flat at 2.9%. Oil +1.6% to $61.5. Iron ore +0.4% to $76.4. ASX futures +0.3% (Aust mkt didn’t go down as much as US so not coming up as fast). $A 0.7937

1125 2018-02-15 21:12:00 I don't support #TransMountain risking our environment for a dying energy source where #BC takes all the risk with no reward to benefit a US oil company.  Let’s #KeepCanadaWorking by retraining people to have non-boom/bust #oiljobs in new clean energy sectors.
1126 2018-02-15 21:11:59 The tea tree oil skin care range from the body shop is so great for skin!
1127 2018-02-15 21:11:47 Kind of like oil drilling and fracking...”not in MY backyard”
1128 2018-02-15 21:11:46 I'm not even talking about that. Those ATVs, they use oil, need batteries and are made of plastics and metals. All extracted from the earth. If you look at that study a lot of the economic activity comes from selling and manufacturing outdoor vehicles.
1129 2018-02-15 21:11:42 Some oil cleansing...
1130 2018-02-15 21:11:31 Thanks - we figure we're his guardian angels. (And we know we picked a good one - he always makes us smile!)
1131 2018-02-15 21:11:29 Oil
1132 2018-02-15 21:11:29 Yep. John McCain's career recipients $7,740,521. They've done pretty good in their career choice. And just think this is just one lobby NRA. Think big oil, Koch Bros. Businesses lobby for tax reform. No end of the total receipts. Billions? Trillion maybe? For how many years?
1133 2018-02-15 21:11:20 With the Oil Co? - I’d go back to them any day, they were great for opportunities to step into roles for short periods of time.  Still have my “Life Saving Rules” and “Taxi” prompt cards.  
1134 2018-02-15 21:11:09 But your heart doesn’t break for the countries you illegally invade, like Syria? How about the innocent lives your ILLEGAL OCCUPATION HAS TAKEN??? Nahhhh...oil is more important, and sucking up to “Israel”, right..?
1135 2018-02-15 21:10:42 Fun fact bc I've given up on being productive: "A separate new survey found that people have turned to beer, baby oil, Coke, petroleum jelly, lemonade, fruit juice, and butter as oh-so-wrong alternatives to contact lens solution."
1136 2018-02-15 21:10:40 - Trumps spineless response to the parkland shooting proves his ass belongs to us, said NRA.
- Yeah right, said Putin.
- Get in line, said the oil lobby.
- ...and the line is growing, said the KKK.

1137 2018-02-15 21:10:35 aveeno eczema lotion and coconut oil work wonders. eat hella anti-inflammatory foods for a while, like a month. get a filter for your shower head and stop using soap and body wash. seriously just use water (not too hot), and pat skin dry after bathing. i'm an eczema pro
1138 2018-02-15 21:10:29 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
1139 2018-02-15 21:10:23 Why don’t the companies that make billions off big oil, pesticides, big pharma, and assault rifles use their resources to reinvest in a new infrastructure to make a positive impact on humanity? They will still make billions. Why is hate celebrated and monetized in lieu of love?
1140 2018-02-15 21:10:18 In BC, we get most of our petroleum products from the US. Your dirty tar-sands oil is too expensive. You can keep it.
1141 2018-02-15 21:10:16 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
1142 2018-02-15 21:10:13 Are you offering to not chain yourself to an earth mover if we tax the oil coming through? Just like the caca "kids" there is room for negotiation. Your move......
1143 2018-02-15 21:10:13 Hunting and Palm Oil, we have no conscious.
1144 2018-02-15 21:09:53 What kind of oil change takes a fucking hour

1149 2018-02-15 21:09:01 It's not a "welcome boost" it's the "starter for ten" West of Shetland is an open secret in the oil industry. Another 30 to 40 years of production across numerous fields yet to be developed, even discovered.
1150 2018-02-15 21:08:46 This is why I say continuously the oil on our lives is not 4 everybody. I pronounce that in the most humble way. Breathing momentum into a mission, vision, or a dream is hard enough. Why add people who are more concerned with proven who they are than seeing the dream

1154 2018-02-15 21:08:36 He sold his soul to the NRA, oil, and white nationalism for a promise he’ll be immortalized with a monument aka “the wall”
1155 2018-02-15 21:08:31 So it’s not the oil? What is it now?

1159 2018-02-15 21:07:52 Yes. Devalue the naira to stimulate foreign export! Sorry remind me what we were exporting again apart from crude oil whose price is not determined by us. There is a problem in Nigeria but it can never be solved with partisanship.
1160 2018-02-15 21:07:34 I’d never advise someone to put money in. Just saying that it isn’t a scam. It’s a commodity just like oil / gold. Just a very very risky one. May aswell go to Ladbrokes
1161 2018-02-15 21:07:12 Face it everybody!  The GOP has been for sale to the highest bidder for a long, long time - big guns, big oil - you got the $$$, the GOPee will take care of you - no $$, thoughts and prayers.
1162 2018-02-15 21:07:04 @joerogan it’s oil. The special interest groups deregulating parks and coast is oil. @CameronHanes
1163 2018-02-15 21:07:04 Heavy hitters cartridges are trash, I use the Alpine cartridges and they are dope, they use live resin instead of oil... never had any problems wit em
1164 2018-02-15 21:06:43 That's not an argument, because I might just as well say your policies as cure-all snake oil. Which cures nothing, except freedom, incentives and progress.

Also, insurance companies are weaker - they haven't destroyed the economy so far, unlike the gov.
1165 2018-02-15 21:06:40 I don’t rag on Chia or Oil for this. Just diff viewpoints on what to build.

1167 2018-02-15 21:06:25 I'm creating some visual art today with ze gf. Excited to work with some new stuff(oil pens) on canvas. Also, will be playing at The Lumberyard later(around 9pm/10pm). Come out and grab a beer, or ten beers.
1168 2018-02-15 21:06:21 Did you all see Dr. Josh Axe's live video on CBD Oil???
1169 2018-02-15 21:06:17 Agreed. I have the standard orange one, works for everything, grease, oil, wd-40, you name it
1170 2018-02-15 21:06:16 Hahaha, you gotta get back active man, start working them joints and get on a nice fish oil supplement very life changing
1171 2018-02-15 21:05:59 I wouldn't hold my breath.
1172 2018-02-15 21:05:57 Miracles drops and wild growth oil can be purchased in your local beauty supply store , there’s no reason why you shouldn’t have edges !
1173 2018-02-15 21:05:50 H much poorer is Africa becoming thanks to rampant minerals, oil and gas extraction. #worldbank  estimates Sub-Saharan Africa loses roughly $100 billion of ANS annually
1174 2018-02-15 21:05:45 Hold on, why would Russians be *importing* vodka? That'd be like the Saudis importing oil.
1175 2018-02-15 21:05:29 Taking smoke breaks at work to hit from my cannibus oil is the best idea i’ve ever had
1176 2018-02-15 21:05:21 The governance by committee it will lead to corruption, political interference and it won't be prone to evaluation. A National oil company would be judged by productivity and KPIs,heads will roll with mismanagement mistakes. Like Lebanese central bank for example!(Youssef Roukoz)
1177 2018-02-15 21:05:08 Mario Fontanazza III from Oil City, Starting Guard and DT as a freshman. 3 sacks and 3rd leading tackler on the team with 73.  New Oil City Football record holder in the deadlift at 580 pounds. Soon to break all the other records.
1178 2018-02-15 21:05:05 Yup. 0% Producton tax for new fields for 7 years if oil is under $70/bbl. very low tax for new fields if price is over $70. How about “corporate largesse”. Turning away fair oil revenue to help w deficit makes the Senate $1000 pfd plan, which still leaves a deficit, more likely.
1179 2018-02-15 21:05:01 Ouch, Boring answer rub oil of cloves on it. Less boring answer rub brandy on it...

1181 2018-02-15 21:04:32 Steve Pieczenik warned about Water Wars years ago on Infowars. Especially China & India who are already fighting over damming the Himalayas. Arabia is also water poor. Their groundwater will be depleted within a decade & desalination uses up too much oil.#qanon

1183 2018-02-15 21:04:25 Do you trust the oil sector's management ?
1184 2018-02-15 21:04:24 どうもで～す(^^;)
1185 2018-02-15 21:04:16 you calling oil humid? WOW you're so funny 
1186 2018-02-15 21:04:13 Cuz that's her right!   

@realDonaldTrump is a fraud.  He's a fake president.  Snake oil salesman
1187 2018-02-15 21:03:57 Idk they will leave and abandon you,, do not trust Americans they have broken every promise to everyone ..started all these wars and now funding both ypg,, and turkey,,,just like every other war...the war isn't abt oil as much as it is central banks...this the real truth
1188 2018-02-15 21:03:52 He says this but what did he do when he was in office. Dems had control for about 18 months and did nothing.  He is a very charismatic speaker, but then so are snake oil salemen. And you don't believe what they say either!
1189 2018-02-15 21:03:26 My next oil change isn’t until after I graduate that just means it’s close!
1190 2018-02-15 21:03:20 The thing about bubbles is, everything goes up. Even stocks without fundamentals will also see increase in activities.

Stocks like japaul oil on the NSE were rising until the bubble burst in 2007.

You have to look like the other half too. Don't just pick the successful side

1195 2018-02-15 21:02:27 The early Iraq war may have been perpetuated by oil, but to that thought. we used to actually DESTROY oil reserves to lessen the Iraqis advancement in their political motives. I would say that the US sometimes doesn't involve themselves in the right manner

1206 2018-02-15 21:00:24 Yes. This would be a reasonable band aid until the tech was developed. My issue is that so long as we fall back on using oil - the drive to find alternatives will remain on the back burner. We need to be “forced” to find other sources or else it’s “business as usual” apparently.
1207 2018-02-15 21:00:19 but big oil won't let u do that will they? too much profit to lose... they call the shots in AB, always have...

BTW, 80% of Vancouver refined oil products come from the US.

Also,  we are a port... we also can import fuel we need...

1213 2018-02-15 20:59:36 Doug took my car to the dealership to have the oil changed and they told me it’s still under warranty which means when I spent $600 to fix my air conditioner I DIDNT HAVE TO 
1214 2018-02-15 20:59:35 It would be cool to be able to send people smells. I want to send you a sniff text of this rocking essential oil that’s blessing my nose.

1218 2018-02-15 20:58:58 Lobbyists don’t want to see their stock value in oil drop so they’ll downplay this all day and undersell it.
1219 2018-02-15 20:58:57 It's delicious! Coworkers always jealous. I add a teaspoon of hemp seed oil to the pea+hummus mix for my daily Omega 3!

1221 2018-02-15 20:58:53 So what. What about millions and  hundreds  of millions of dollars that vastly mostly go to left wing politians get from hard left foundations? These foundations give way more then oil companies.
1222 2018-02-15 20:58:47 I have an addiction to the #Paleo #breakfast I’ve been eating lately & I don’t see tiring of it anytime soon.

1223 2018-02-15 20:58:40 I forgot how sensual of an experience using a new pot of dipbrow is after using the same flaky year old pot I kept adding oil to. ITS SO SMOOTH AND CREAMY.

1225 2018-02-15 20:58:28 food store would be groceries as it implies you are buying a product whereas a Resturant you are buying mostly service. 

Would a Oil Change place be a "Oil Store"?

1230 2018-02-15 20:57:49 The oil sands are a massively dirty environment in their natural state.  Harvesting the oil and reclaimation of the land is a really good project.  Wildlife flourishes where it once got covered in oil and languished.
1231 2018-02-15 20:57:36 If Notley really cared more for the citizens of her province than fighting for a US oil company and their profits she be demanding every ounce of bitumen be processed in Alberta instead of exporting a job with every barrel.

1236 2018-02-15 20:56:56 Hard to believe a support group would be considered a bad thing. Our community reminds me of those featured in Lorenzo’s Oil and The Dallas Buyers Club...
1237 2018-02-15 20:56:36 This is absolutely effing revolting! The GOP wants to tax the voters for Internet purchases but don't want to tax the oil billionaires a single dime more. Talk about one messed up party. The GOP must go!

1247 2018-02-15 20:55:03 The fact that this is even a story is insulting
1248 2018-02-15 20:55:00 what is with everyone and building a refinery? The simple idea is to export the oil to the global market... building a refinery will not solve the fact that AB oil is landlocked
1249 2018-02-15 20:54:50 Did you in fact survive prostate cancer with treatments of cannabis oil? And no chemo? Please enlighten us !!!
1250 2018-02-15 20:54:39 Demand for oil is not the same as demand for Alberta's costly sludge. The glory days are over.
1251 2018-02-15 20:54:36 But yet you are ok with 18 year olds being sent off to war in defense of oil company profits

1254 2018-02-15 20:54:31 Watching the game on an oil rig and there’s a rangers fan in the corner making snide remarks , love to bounce this can of coke of his head  definitely going to celebrate loud if we score  HH 
1255 2018-02-15 20:54:29 @BMW 2 weeks after an oil service is done by an  authorized BMW service station, I got an oil leak. 1 week after the oil leakage, the engine is damaged. Neither the service station nor the costumer relationship department want to acknowledge the faulty service.

1257 2018-02-15 20:54:15 At lithia getting an oil change and I'm pretty sure whoever is doing it is talking about how dirty my car is inside and out 
1258 2018-02-15 20:54:12 something you should do today: buy a coconut oil product
1259 2018-02-15 20:54:08 i need my nails done, a pedicure, and a oil change........now.
1260 2018-02-15 20:54:07 How will she prove it’s his?  He has to provide a sample. And who cares
1261 2018-02-15 20:54:06 Maybe, IDK, but highly possible. Not to get too outside the box, but I think the rest of the world is beginning to interact with the USD in diff ways.  $BTCUSD, Gold and the @LukeGromen favorite Yuan/Oil give the world so many more options that USD has to compete with.
1262 2018-02-15 20:53:58 Oil's graat but many issues to consider nowadays. More so than in the past. You can have oodles of the stuff but it's the cost of getting it to market and then the pricing. Our structure is very different to Norway etc. So good stuff but doesn't match the godsend of 50 yrs ago.
1263 2018-02-15 20:53:50 Getting my oil changed and all the guys in the shop are talking about 50 shades 
1264 2018-02-15 20:53:44 I think we need to show the people who voted no the independence movement have resolved the issues during the first referendum, such as currency, the economy, the EU (efta preferred), oil prices and that Westminster does nothing to help scotland, shout out its failures proudly.
1265 2018-02-15 20:53:01 I have not been this fatigued since a 72 hour shift in the oil field.
1266 2018-02-15 20:52:57 The Talban and Bin Laden were around long before. Putting fear and murdering innocent people, having stranglehold. The country was already in caos. Been problems there for decades. All want power and control of the oil.
1267 2018-02-15 20:52:47 Incon = fire, Mattypocket = Oil. The Thing goes....
1268 2018-02-15 20:52:41 I guess my biggest fear is regret for not going all out on chasing my dreams. I don't want to stick with something where I just feel "okay." Gotta keep burning that midnight oil towards what I want to do and one day it will pay off
1269 2018-02-15 20:52:25 Got some snacks at the vending machine when I was getting my oil changed and when I reached in to get em there was already a snack AND a drink in there  good karma to me bad karma to someone else lol

1289 2018-02-15 20:50:21 Horgan is on the right side of history and all this irresponsible fossil expansion madness needs to stop.  The out-dated climate plan, designed way back in 2013 when it looked like oil would be $120+ forever, is a plan that actually increases emissions.  Start over.

1316 2018-02-15 20:46:16 There is actually no argument to made that non investors don't reap tremendous benefits from capitol market its why we went from 13 colonies to economic super power.  Average car driver saves 10K in fuel cost yearly from oil and gas investment and did so with no risk of money.
1317 2018-02-15 20:46:12 Sustainable Palm Oil is the main reason jungles and forest are disappearing, so more and more PALM plants can be planted. Makes no sense.

1359 2018-02-15 20:38:18 Whose going to guard against the trigger happy guards? This is the logic of the madhouse - human beings have violent tendencies inherent in their makeup - the angry and unbalanced seek out firearms because they know it gives them god like powers to kill. Life is not a Western.
1360 2018-02-15 20:38:15 The leftist, as we see here, use children and victims to sell their snake oil. While leftist continue to focus on this one flawed talking point they are incapable or do not want to find a real solution. Disarming responsible gun owners would only make matters worse.

1380 2018-02-15 20:34:59 “While politicians claim they won’t divert the money this time, their so-called lockbox is pure snake oil and simply a PR stunt. Read the fine print and discover the politicians retain the right to divert the money!”
1381 2018-02-15 20:34:54 Yet unsurprising.
1382 2018-02-15 20:34:48 Status: It's currently snowing, ever so gently, in my cube.

I was just sitting here with my chin perched on my hand, reading the screen when a white flake drifted into view. Then another. I think it's time for me to do a hot oil scalp treatment or something. O_o
1383 2018-02-15 20:34:21 My essential oil diffuser and salt rock lamp are the best combination for my days off. I never want to leave my room because I’m so relaxed 
1384 2018-02-15 20:34:16 Finally going to get an oil change this weekend so my car doesnt expload
1385 2018-02-15 20:34:00 This is exactly the problem. Now you are producing tonnage of plankton that will sink, and be decomposed by bacteria, deeper, and this will suck the oxygen from the water column. 

Like an oil spill. Only intentional on our part, using complex carbon in the form of phytoplankton.

1387 2018-02-15 20:33:54 Cleaned out my car, got an oil change, got all of my homework done, and just finished my last test of the week 
1388 2018-02-15 20:33:41 As I said before what hostility has Iran ever shown to us . ?Has it bombed us, ? invaded us ? I suggest you look up the formation of BP and how we British overthrew their democratic government to seize their Oil fields .
1389 2018-02-15 20:33:26 Man at the end of the day these politicians and organizations are getting cut a check from gun manufacturers oil companies and basically anyone else with enough money and y’all elected the right president to keep it that way
1390 2018-02-15 20:33:26 AB is diversified... it's just that the returns from oil are typically higher than other industries. Take loblaws for instance, the returns in the grocery space are much less than they are with oil (over the long term)
1391 2018-02-15 20:33:24 Yeah this morning oil spillage too, sounds awful! Hope you get home safe and soon chick x
1392 2018-02-15 20:33:17 They will be sharing 3 hours light in this Benin city like say na red oil akara (oil pronounced in the Benin tongue). If you know you know
1393 2018-02-15 20:33:15 I use 55cm, 65cm and 75cm stability balls. I use potted plant saucers, plastic oil catch pans or laundry baskets for my bases. I know some people use Home Depot buckets, but my balls are too big for that I think.
1394 2018-02-15 20:33:04 You should look into the role of Maritime Spatial Planning in acheiving proper governance and management of Oil and Gas activities.

1397 2018-02-15 20:32:45 I dont think it will have any sustantial effect, it is require to consider the fact that the income generated by oil or any raw material/commodity is lost in corruption and mismanagement if funds...food and medicine is the least of the regime's problems
1398 2018-02-15 20:32:37 Hi @thameswater how do I report businesses dumping oil in the sink?
1399 2018-02-15 20:32:28 My criminal justice professor today told us how the discovery of natural gas in Britain dropped suicide rates to almost none. People used to gas themselves to death. Natural gas doesn’t kill you like oil burning gas will 1/

1406 2018-02-15 20:31:25 Paint factories, like the one pictured, have been going on for 50 years that I know about. Firsed based in Europe. "European Originals," passed off as original oil paintings done by one artists. Done by many each with a specialty.
1407 2018-02-15 20:31:16 The Energy industry in Canada has been driven by low oil prices to drive efficiencies.  Lower costs and improve environmental performance.  the solutions being developed here in AB are being applied around the world.  #TradeElite

1409 2018-02-15 20:31:08 You guys I never believed castor oil would work but it’s doing miracles for my eyebrows
1410 2018-02-15 20:30:59 Wasn't it related to payment for hash oil though? That's kinda a given you would be charged for that....federally illegal substance.
1411 2018-02-15 20:30:57 Who's buying from Chevron and 
E/mobile? Take the oil free and leave Biafrans to be alive and support Biafra referendum 2018.
1412 2018-02-15 20:30:52 Mate, literally, whack a load of oil on, slap on your lycra, go out and enjoy the world without thinking everyone's out to kill you. That every driver is the devil, or better still, have a wank and chill out. You're boring me now.
1413 2018-02-15 20:30:44 I’m the type of girlfriend that will wash your car (detailed wash), take it for an oil change and buy you some wings/beer as a Valentines gift

1424 2018-02-15 20:29:15 Congratulations @IsabelleTarver you won the essential oil giveaway!!! Please message me so I can get your info
1425 2018-02-15 20:29:12 Greattt I get an extra break ! The downside is it’s because my Fucking supervisor spilt/sprayed me with fucking oil . So freaking heated
1426 2018-02-15 20:29:08 I use the $UWT, but same thing really. I agree with you, everything I follow sends a bearish fundamental signal, but sentiment is huge with oil and I think that is what is controlling presently. Checking CFTC numbers show everyone bullish, and they continue to support position
1427 2018-02-15 20:29:06 I’ve been on the diet grind for 4 months - down 43lbs now! I’ve been eating proteins & cookin with avocado oil only. Eating healthy fats and an abundance of green vegetables. Been using ghee instead of butter too! Just drinking water and my “treat” is simply an apple. Keep it up!
1428 2018-02-15 20:29:05 Increased oil and gas activity on UT Lands has dramatically increased the amount of methane emissions as a result. Methane is more destructive than carbon monoxide to the environment.
1429 2018-02-15 20:28:45 She can shed blood and oil even shit sef we don't care.
1430 2018-02-15 20:28:41 Don't you think it would be more practical for us just to manufactured in natural gas our selves rather than buy it back. At the moment we sent 31 million barrels of oil a day to the states and he's going to try to get us. If you got your head out of the sand so to speak
1431 2018-02-15 20:28:27 Take a look at #UK #CBD oil @canaxen I recently start using their products for anxiety. I can highly recommend 
1432 2018-02-15 20:28:20 “Chevron Supreme Motor Oil”
Me: [imagines Prowl just pouring oil all over his chevron]
1433 2018-02-15 20:28:09 @MarksReeseWIP It’s a shame that with all this dry hump talk and it coming from Capler all I can think of is coconut oil.
1434 2018-02-15 20:28:00 Is she drinking rum and olive oil?
1435 2018-02-15 20:27:47 The government made a dumb move and that was the over-reliance on oil. Two years ago when the oil fell they entered the crisis. The problem is that the US is making the situation worse than it naturally is. Every day I see in Argentinian TV someone calling for US intervention
1436 2018-02-15 20:27:37 At  history of Second World War I learn why German have to attack Russia and Japan have to attack allies. 
I found out the answer of those questions is Oil.
1437 2018-02-15 20:27:17 Speakers are but one of many many items folks with wax/oil finished furniture deal with. I love the look, and is why I bought a desktop that is waxed. But..it requires much more TLC than furniture with a sealed/impermeable finish. Water glasses, great from food, etc all affect it
1438 2018-02-15 20:27:14 Who’s actually who in Syria? I can only support the Kurds. The rest is a nonsense re oil between US/ UK coalition disgrace. Real lives, real people.
1439 2018-02-15 20:26:52 Yeah. A glass pot in the microwave works well. A bit of oil. But once it has been in there, and didn't pop, they are dead.
1440 2018-02-15 20:26:48 China opened their energy exchange several weeks ago. Pipeline Russia to China in operation & oil flowing. Oil so speculative hard 2 know what's going on-is petro yuan affecting? US frackers must have $25/barrel just 4 expenses. Oil glut will shut down fracking (hopefully)
1441 2018-02-15 20:26:45 @dogwoodbc @Pembina @TidesCanada etc aren't interested in offering "support" to industry, they're interested in getting more $ from #US oil interests...they stand for $...
1442 2018-02-15 20:25:52 I'm garlic sensitive. I would recommend using garlic infused olive oil. You can get it at some local grocery stores. It's okay.
1443 2018-02-15 20:25:40 Off topic a bit but I was wondering if you had any insight on the $USO chart...Why does it continue to move higher? All evidence I can find suggests bearish oil. Am I wrong there? Just wanted to get your thoughts. April puts, long.
1444 2018-02-15 20:25:40 مارأيت على هذا الشيخ الا وعظا وذكرا وكانت محاضراته تفطر القلوب
1445 2018-02-15 20:25:27 Obviously oil is a sore point for Britnats because on the one hand they hate to admit it's importance to the UK economy and on the ohter hand they cant' stand the fact that the oil fields are in Scotland. So Britnats act as if it doesn't exist.
1446 2018-02-15 20:24:55 Fav bread ATM is summer fruit pizza. 100g s/r flour, 60g water, 1dsp sugar, dash o/oil. Mix into dough, roll out thinly. Cover with layer of m/pan, then sprinkle tin summer fruits from freezer. Sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon. Bake for 15-20 minutes #veganrecipehour
1447 2018-02-15 20:24:37 Someone left essential oil infused honey for ppl who are sick in the kitchen and it’s pretty bomb and i lowkey wanna take the entire container but that would be fucked up lol
1448 2018-02-15 20:24:35 This "Country" as you put it, should be embarrassed by the oil sands and non sustainability of your eco mess. BC does not want your bitumen ever!
1449 2018-02-15 20:24:33 Be interesting to examine what faction does Elon Musk belong to & does it have to do with Corporate Military stealing Oil in the Middle East .

1453 2018-02-15 20:23:54 Drink some cod liver oil. 1 tsp daily w a meal
1454 2018-02-15 20:23:54 Megan, that's so sweet! What kind of car did you need an oil change in?
1455 2018-02-15 20:23:50 Nobody needs to topple him to get the oil.. Him and Chavez managed to destroy Venezuela’s oil industry to the point where it produces less than half of what it used to... That should be a record by itself don’t you think?
BTW, why don’t you live there if you like it that much? 
1456 2018-02-15 20:23:47 Palm oil is harmful to people and the environment. It should be banned.
1457 2018-02-15 20:23:25 So the rich get a TRILLION dollars and the poor get canned beans, powdered milk, and vegetable oil. 

This is already how America treats tribes through the federal commodity food program #mtpol #mtleg
1458 2018-02-15 20:23:25 Can everyone on Titan have a max of 1 oil pump on a vein as some people need to use the limited amount of them as well @PS4ARKServer
1459 2018-02-15 20:23:17 Rosemary essential oil is actually the bee's knees.
1460 2018-02-15 20:23:16 It seems the only thing that algos care about re oil price is the USD. I believe that we have a serious glut in Oil supply and poor demand but from traders perspective it is solely being driven by the USD. Once that correlation breaks, oil will find itself on a steep slope down
1461 2018-02-15 20:23:16 Argan Oil is packed full of repairing and nurturing antioxidants for glowing skin! It’s in our #FrankincenseIntense Eye Cream!
1462 2018-02-15 20:22:48 If you run out of brush cleanser and you need to give your tools a quick clean, simply wash with olive oil and rinse them out with hot water

1466 2018-02-15 20:22:29 It's a complete scam - this 'govt' is nothing more than a PR dept for Big Oil. The dinosaurs @liberal_party will call the military to shoot people to ensure their masters' bidding. #cdnpoli

1471 2018-02-15 20:21:48 Another quick and simple meal is a gram flour omelette. simply mix gram flour with water until its a thin batter, add flavorings and cook in a frying pan with a little oil. #veganrecipehour
1472 2018-02-15 20:21:31 I’m really just here to get an oil change. Everybody in here got a ringtone on their phones
1473 2018-02-15 20:21:02 I'm an oil and biomass guy.
1474 2018-02-15 20:20:58 The truck looks good on track. 
1475 2018-02-15 20:20:57 Coconut oil is bae 
1476 2018-02-15 20:20:48 Essentially, what I'm asking is: HOW does climate change help the oil companies?
1477 2018-02-15 20:20:27 This is why Republicans hate renewable energy. If America and our allies no longer needed oil, it would defund Putin along with rogue regimes in the Middle East. Besides the obvious benefits, Renewables are in our national security interests.
1478 2018-02-15 20:20:21 I bleached my hair twice, did the darkest parts first, then the middle of my hair then I let it sit for a few days and put lots of oil in it and got a hair mask and honestly, basically all of the green is gone
1479 2018-02-15 20:20:13 Guess it was meant to stabilize revenue shortfall generated from our oil production when prices dropped below $50 per barrel. Don’t  think that is still the case though. It has metamorphosed into a constant revenue stream
1480 2018-02-15 20:20:11 When you harbor no respect for the Earth you live on, you will always allow it to be destroyed and misused. That lack of respect leads to oil pipelines and hunting for sport. To disrespect the animal is to reveal yourself to be a monster in a mans body. You’re spiritually void.
1481 2018-02-15 20:20:10 تصدق فعلا 
1482 2018-02-15 20:20:09 Not at all. 2016 Britain got 40% of its energy from gas, 20% from NUCLEAR power! 9% from coal, 8% from oil. So you'd trade particulates that can be removed from the  air (CO2 scrubbers, etc) for nuclear power that can destroy your children's future in one day, in one accident?
1483 2018-02-15 20:20:05 I’ve been driving around on empty for like 2 days, my oil change is months overdue and my other bills are killing me 
1484 2018-02-15 20:20:02 @Halfords_uk excellent service at your newport store today.
I was shown how to check my oil and top it up once i got home. Fab considering ive never lifted the bonnet up before. 
1485 2018-02-15 20:19:56 But be careful if you have animals because they shouldn't ingest it!! 
Also a mixture of running alcohol, witch hazel, peppermint, lavender, and tea tree oil helps!
1486 2018-02-15 20:19:42 Black Castor oil supposed to make your hair grow faster. Haven’t tried it myself tho
1487 2018-02-15 20:19:41 Today's sell off on CVE was a gift. 
Started new position in this one as it's a level where risk reward is favorable. 

Still lots of room for oil and Gas as well as gold miners from last week's low.  Like KIrkland lake KL and Goldcorp GG best going forward AEM on weakness
1488 2018-02-15 20:19:40 lyndsay - "wait, you're suppose to change your oil every 3,000 miles? I thought it was every 3 years!"
all of us - ".... how are you alive."
1489 2018-02-15 20:19:33 It is in your power even now to break the alabaster box, and pour the precious oil of joy upon his head, as did the woman of old, whose memorial is to this day set forth wherever the gospel is preached. #SoulFood #Spiritual #Evening #CHSpurgeon

NEWS FLASH:
EVERY PERSON IN WASHINGTON is owned by an orgaization or company. Usually both.
Big Pharm, NRA, Monsanto, Big Oil, etc.

ALL of which are killing Americans in one way or another.

1492 2018-02-15 20:19:08 Silk Body Cream  The mango butter, rice bran oil, and macadamia nut oil really help with extremely dry skin. It’ll melt right into your skin and lock in that moisture straight out the shower. We developed this formula for our dry skin because we wash our hands constantly.
1493 2018-02-15 20:18:38 I really don’t wanna sit at Walmart when I get off to get my oil changed 
1494 2018-02-15 20:18:35 I worked offshore Louisiana, I have seen the damage created by the oil rigs and support vessels, it wasn't pretty. That's why I will vote for Joe and all Dems for South Carolina
1495 2018-02-15 20:18:29 Most likely an oil change service light. Which is usually a good thing to check.
1496 2018-02-15 20:18:27 You are aware of CBD oil being sold legally here, right? This molecule has wonderful properties. If it's balanced against the THC content of the cannabis, the pyscho-active effects are harmonised. Unlike the super strength, so-called 'Skunk' which is grown to have high THC.
1497 2018-02-15 20:18:15 hmmm can you show me that dangerous jobs like mining, oil drilling, sewage, sea fishing are the jobs women go for???

1499 2018-02-15 20:17:55 FBI now warning about Chinese-not war but economic. No one noticed amount of stuff we buy is Chinese? I watch oil prices & try 2 figure out w poor background in that but Petro yuan must be taking off. Why else sudden warning about China?

1503 2018-02-15 20:17:25 It is considered a consumable. Roughly 1 quart every 8-10 hours of run time. Consumption varies and we carefully track oil usage of each engine.
1504 2018-02-15 20:17:03 انا تعرفت على وحده في باريس طلعت يمنيه مقيمه في المملكه هي وعيالها بعدها طلعو أمريكا على قولها المهم تسب في السعوديه وفي حكامها قهرتني وأكلت معايا قمت حاسبت عنهم في المطعم واعتبرتها اهانه مني لهم وطلعت.
1505 2018-02-15 20:16:51 It’s bc of palm oil production. Read your ingredients of your food and beauty supplies and don’t buy things with palm oil unless they’re sustainably sourced (rainforest alliance products) and pressure your favorite brands to switch to sustainability.

1510 2018-02-15 20:16:29 I'm fairly liberal and I think Chavez and Maduro are horrible criminals who have managed to undermine Venezual's democratic institutions and turn the country into a Stalinist wannabe dictatorship. All that without mentioning how they impoverished a wealthy oil producing counry
1511 2018-02-15 20:16:24 You can also do same, and let other world leaders salute and appreciate your courage.....
1512 2018-02-15 20:16:02 very true!  The oil industry uses big data to track energy consumption and performance throughout operations, to drive efficiencies pipelines companies are using big data to predict where pipeline leaks will occur and adress these before accidents happen.  #TradeElite
1513 2018-02-15 20:15:48 We know we are shit now but the point is you've just been lifted to the top due to oil money

1516 2018-02-15 20:15:30 【add oil】

[慣用句](香港やその他中華英語圏)
1.頑張れ

同じ意味を持つ中国語の慣用句「加油(jia you)」からの借用語。直訳ですね。「油を加える」→「頑張れ」。

例 Add oil lor. I'll support you. 頑張れ。応援するよ。

1524 2018-02-15 20:14:01 No, not at all. Wot I do know is Venezuela’s being in the eye of the US a long long time due to its oil reserves. I also know that most of the trouble seems 2 hav happened in the most affluent areas of the country & that multinationals have withheld certain products from stores.
1525 2018-02-15 20:13:36 Let’s get this oil change
1526 2018-02-15 20:12:43 Oh, we worked on cars, too. Learned how to change a tire, change and check your own oil, bike ride to work to save on gas. Cheap entertainment consisted of card and boardgames by candlelight and drinking cheap beer, lol
1527 2018-02-15 20:12:38 มึงหิวอะไรตอนนี้

1529 2018-02-15 20:12:26 I was at the only match I think he started. Was bloody frightening every time he got involved! Like he'd put oil on his gloves.
1530 2018-02-15 20:12:19 Cruz is a Mercer and Koch puppet. He takes millions from the oil industry and the NRA. He only promotes their interests, not yours. If you don’t know who pays him you are just fooling yourself.
1531 2018-02-15 20:12:06 Omg. What if someone brought in an oil diffuser? Ya know the kind that just sits there. Not the kind that mists. Can’t argue with that!!
1532 2018-02-15 20:11:40 How is the abatement fund being used, if not for things like this? Oil companies trash our state, pay their taxes that are inadequate to fixing the problems they cause. We must diversify our economy!
1533 2018-02-15 20:11:31 Just checked my oil and topped it up. I'm an independent woman.

1544 2018-02-15 20:10:02 Point is we won't need oil in anywhere near the quantity we used to. 2020 is the year BEV cars will explode cutting oil use.

1548 2018-02-15 20:09:27 But there is a HUGE problem now that is, and is coming from the first issue--mental health. We have to talke one problem (pistons) so we can focus on the root (oil) 

Problems alwayz tend to create more problems. It's not one or the other. It's both.

1552 2018-02-15 20:09:08 I just went to the store to start my diet again.  

Spent like only 30 bucks.  

Got Chicken Breast, Tilapia, Eggs, Sweet Potatoes for baking, basmatti rice, olive oil, and veggie steamers for the microwave

ALDI is a champ.
1553 2018-02-15 20:08:47 My son is taking medical marijuana for epilepsy and OCD. We had to go through hoops to get the CBD oil (the non high component ) at a cost of $140 for 60ml, or 30 doses, 15 days worth. Plus must renew permit every 6 months. $3360 for one year
not covered by insurance. NOT CHEAP
1554 2018-02-15 20:08:40 @harrys Probably occurred to you already, but have you thought about bringing out a shaving soap? I like to use soap + brush (and pre shave oil) but I'm having to use a competitors with your blades!
1555 2018-02-15 20:08:34 It’s cuticle oil
1556 2018-02-15 20:08:22 Read my thread I posted. It's not popular but you're right. However, an engine leaking oil will cause the pistons to misfire and stop completely causing another, greater problem. I'm from Montana and love hunting and guns but I've had enough. 

You're not wrong. It's not guns.
1557 2018-02-15 20:08:18 My kids have been born into a life with advantage and opportunity because I work in oil to provide that advantage for them. My working class job pays for their privilege and means because I do a hard job that’s well paid, they have choices. I bought a house for school catchment
1558 2018-02-15 20:08:04 How disappointing when you order food and it comes out absolutely swimming in oil  #wasteofmoney
1559 2018-02-15 20:08:02 We should be worried because Nigeria’s economy runs on Oil.
1560 2018-02-15 20:07:38 I spilled almost an entire bottle of lavender essential oil in my purse yesterday lol 
1561 2018-02-15 20:07:37 It's not our use of oil and gas that lets big corp hold the world to ransom. It's bad governance & corruption. The US can produce enough oil for itself but there's money to be made for military-industrial complex so you have war in the Middle-East "over oil".
1562 2018-02-15 20:07:29 He has gun oil everywhere he goes.

1564 2018-02-15 20:07:15 110% true. Hussein wanted to price his oil in Euros and Gaddafi wanted to start the gold dinar. Two things which would have messed up the international monetary order.

1570 2018-02-15 20:06:27 You are also the the best at invading other states and calling it PROTECTION. You say "we are protecting our citizens". You want to just oil, you are able to kill your own people just to get oil.

1576 2018-02-15 20:06:08 who knew trying to get an oil change could be so difficult
1577 2018-02-15 20:05:57 I'm not denying that people are accelerating it and I'm not *personally attacking* you on this. I'm saying that y'all are also contributing in the same way cuz that water you think you're spraying might be oil
1578 2018-02-15 20:05:49 JFC these Russia snake oil salesmen will never give it a break. It is absolutely and astonishingly pathetic. They have offloaded all relevant discussion of the issues to their McCarthyism.

1581 2018-02-15 20:05:25 Don’t hold your breath. Cory Gardner values money over principle and if it means Big Oil or local ranchers or developers want those lands, he won’t protect the planet or sacred land.
1582 2018-02-15 20:05:22 Most "renewables" cause more damage than fossil fuels when you actually look into it. & "renewables" simply don't provide sufficient or reliable enough energy to meet our needs (where solar panels are covered in snow & there's no wind).

1600 2018-02-15 20:02:04 That’s a great point for all of us to remember. Sometimes we do need to pick up some extra work. That’s part of being a team. People get sick or fired or any number of reasons. That can cause us to burn the midnight oil. But that should be finite. We all need balance.
1601 2018-02-15 20:01:59 You can't have your cake & eat it to. To make it sound like he inherited this team in massive tailspin w/ no hope in sight is just not accurate. Obviously, they had their issues but look at that list...there was plenty to work with.

1616 2018-02-15 20:00:42 Absolutely.  RUS has earned more money this year, on less production.  Shale will blow its corks at 50-60 oil, if it over-produces, then wilt, while OPEC+ sells what they held back for 100+.  Unlike US, this is the core of their ecnomy, not some also ran industry.

1647 2018-02-15 19:57:42 Your conspiracy theory is a bit dated, Komrade. Please report to your next media officer for update.
Large parts of syrian (oil/gas) infrastructure were already sold to putin in the last years. This time you need a different excuse for supporting a murderous tyrant.

1653 2018-02-15 19:56:57 UAE is building the first eco city with all electric trasport and cara, with renewable 4nergy.  And this is a nation built on oil.  America, the next third world country.
1654 2018-02-15 19:56:44 I love the thought that anything Mr Obama did in 8 years in office was because of anything resembling 'common sense'....
1655 2018-02-15 19:56:43 Coconut oil does wonders.
1656 2018-02-15 19:56:06 climate change deniers as well, oil and gas industry
1657 2018-02-15 19:56:03 I know right?! I’ve made ‘small’ adjustments like using coconut oil, replacing diary etc. but I can’t help but feel like that ‘authentic’ taste is lost.
1658 2018-02-15 19:56:01 Big oil would lose their Monopoly and they can't have that right @realDonaldTrump ?
1659 2018-02-15 19:55:35 Afternoon's non consent bills started with bill to ban off-shore oil drilling & infrastructure from state waters. Asm. Rumpf & Minority Leader Bramnick both speak in favor of protecting Jersey Shore from drilling. Bipartisan support
1660 2018-02-15 19:55:16 Or the oil companies have manufactured a survey to support their economic interest which happens to align with your ideological one.
1661 2018-02-15 19:55:12 Only for oil changes
1662 2018-02-15 19:55:04 if you say so Rob.
1663 2018-02-15 19:54:55 Your absolutely worst case senario is your head gasket is starting to cease. Coolant is going into the engine, mixing w/ engine oil & burning. I had that before, not worth even fixing the car!
1664 2018-02-15 19:54:37 This is (at least part of) why I don’t get along well with most other women. I talk like a slightly more socially aware guy, which they do not like. They are (speaking generally) two faced and shallow, which I can not tolerate. It’s like oil and water 
1665 2018-02-15 19:54:33 I'm not against coal OR CO2!
If ALL Coal, Oil, and other Hydrocarbons were burned; then total CO2 in atmosphere would be what it was when World was a wonderland of vegetation, Trees, Herbs, and wild Animals, Before the CO2 was deposited underground by dead animals & Vegetation!
1666 2018-02-15 19:54:30 If we were to tick off all that cafflers head, whisperers for his accomodation, the me craws, namely, and their bacon what harmed butter!
It’s margarseen oil.
1667 2018-02-15 19:54:08 Bucky’s actions weren’t his own lmao why wouldn’t he get a pass? Dude was repeatedly lobotomized over, what, 40-50+ years? Talk to your boy T’Challa cuz it sure seem like he gave Buck a pass and a coupon for some beard oil, too.
1668 2018-02-15 19:54:02 To me he just comes of as soft or a drama queen. I'm betting the later cause I assume like you do he knew what to expect. If he didn't his agent is terrible and should fire him.
1669 2018-02-15 19:53:45 Americas economy is in large part based upon the military industrial complex. The country and the govn't are hopelessly addicted to guns, oil and pain killers. This is also a greed question in addition to a race and violence question (cuz they go hand in hand so well).
1670 2018-02-15 19:53:27 Where would you be without oil? lol
1671 2018-02-15 19:53:10 いやー流石、魔力の量が桁違いだわ(笑)

1674 2018-02-15 19:52:57 bullish brent oil 64.44 one quarter of assets
1675 2018-02-15 19:52:44 No Matt he is an idiot if he thinks Foles is better than Prescott as of now. And we have no idea about Wentz and how he will do going forward. Typical hype over 1 season. Let's see how PHL does next year. Lets ease up on the anointing oil. Geez.
1676 2018-02-15 19:52:38 Nothing but the truth YOU KNOW: Right-wing regional governments are part of U.S.-led international  conspiracy to topple him and take control of the OPEC member’s oil  resources.
“They’re the most unpopular governments on the planet,” he said, naming Argentina, Colombia and Peru.
1677 2018-02-15 19:52:05 I’m at coast tire getting an oil change because when I showed up at the other place the employees were having a fight in the parking lot. — it’s the personal touches! 
1678 2018-02-15 19:51:43 Trumpf has no respect for publicl land! He only cares about the  it makes! If he thought he could get oil from under the White House lawn he’d been drilling yesterday! It’s always about the !

1682 2018-02-15 19:51:03 Literally every body knows United States is trying hard to instil a puppet government in Venezuela so that oil revenues would be misappropriated easily through multinational companies and only a few people would benefit from the riches .
Well,fuck that!
1683 2018-02-15 19:51:03 Wish i had found out earlier about the 2 day event in London  would love to have gone. Is the video discussion on palm oil going to be available to view again?
1684 2018-02-15 19:50:56 Come see us tonight for Manny's Night in Lakeland -- 5125 Florida Ave. S. in Lakeland. We will be giving away TV's and gift cards and oil changes! 4-7 PM.
1685 2018-02-15 19:50:53 Coconut oil in, out, basically all around.
1686 2018-02-15 19:50:50 “And thou hath giveth me a silver tongue, so that I might peddle snake oil in the wilderness, and reapeth rewards like the very finest money changer.” Rubio 2:15

1688 2018-02-15 19:50:22 ya let me just spend 120$ on an oil change ... no problem 
1689 2018-02-15 19:50:11 The oil majors looked super cheap 2012-14. It's like the market's efficient or something.
1690 2018-02-15 19:50:11 Sure.  Now ask them how much they got from big Phrma and big oil.

That's where the real influence is.
1691 2018-02-15 19:50:04 You are suggesting he was left w/ a "mess" and nothing could be further from the truth. To be honest, there are far more impactful younger players in the league today compared to the 80's. The pipeline was certainly thin & we shall see of that changes.
1692 2018-02-15 19:49:42 But you will let our national parks be ruined by greedy oil corporations.
1693 2018-02-15 19:49:40 They knew because most people who spend money on oil finish furniture take the time to learn how to protect the finish from anything they place on it for any length of time  but there’s always a few clueless people who need their hand held every second of the day.
1694 2018-02-15 19:49:40 2017 set a record for 345 mass shootings in America, so your dismissive narrative is ridiculous.  Oh, and I'm 45 years old.  But thanks for thinking I'm young.  Tells me I should keep using my Oil of Olay.
1695 2018-02-15 19:49:33 my sister: yeah this drink has this stuff MCT oil its really good for you

1697 2018-02-15 19:49:25 Jell-O shots & que oil 
1698 2018-02-15 19:49:21 Yeah you missed the key part. THE PEOPLE WITH MONEY only want a certain type of entertainment here. You ever see any Cajun event have problems going? No. It’s jus hip hop and the upper crust of 985 are oil and water. They don’t want that shit here.
1699 2018-02-15 19:49:21 The oil refinery (?) looks very pretty framed by the blue sky

1701 2018-02-15 19:49:00 It’s the ABSOLUTE best! I like combining it with sweet almond oil
1702 2018-02-15 19:48:51 This is why I do my own oil changes.
1703 2018-02-15 19:48:51 I ordered beard oil and balm two months ago and its still not here, that's it I'm trimming my beard

1706 2018-02-15 19:47:41 Once again, my heartfelt thanks to you, @docbastard. I could not despise this snake oil salesman more. Your voice matters.
1707 2018-02-15 19:47:34 Good to have Robert and his mother back 2 years after Leni’s Law.  CBD Oil made a world of difference for Robert.
1708 2018-02-15 19:47:16 track looked slick..
1709 2018-02-15 19:47:03 It’s not that people don’t care. It’s that politicians are paid to not do anything about it. It’s the same as more deregulation after the 2008 crash. Or epa cuts after the bp oil spill. It’s not that they don’t care they actively work against it.
1710 2018-02-15 19:47:00 I Still Think We Should Used Electricity Than Oil. ! ?
1711 2018-02-15 19:46:42 Want to know something about Lex Luthor? He's bald like Mr.Clean. He uses baby oil to shine his bald head.
1712 2018-02-15 19:46:32 just dumped 5 giant pills (of the vitamin & Fish Oil variety) in my mouth and grabbed my water cup only to find it empty.

1714 2018-02-15 19:46:19 Cooking tip: If you stir coconut oil into your kale, it makes it easier to scrape into the trash
1715 2018-02-15 19:46:18 Well from the sound of it it could be of one of 4 things. 
A drive belt
Oil leak or excess oil on engine block burning off
Coolant leak
Loose hose on engine

I hope it's just the burn-off of excess oil. Would need to see car to diagnose more. 
1716 2018-02-15 19:46:18 So you want to add more tax on gasoline at a time we are pumping more oil than anytime? Gas is already too expensive!!!

1720 2018-02-15 19:45:37 Y’all I was supposed to get an oil change in October and it’s just now getting done. 
1721 2018-02-15 19:45:30 Snake oil salesman like the rest of the dems that only support abortion.  Too bad the Dem Party's Chairman's mom had not felt the same!
1722 2018-02-15 19:45:22 Just find anything with a lot of miles on it and in good shape. I got my 06 chevy Silverado for 3k. Had 200k miles and was in perfect physical shape and it's still running great. The key is keeping oil changed
1723 2018-02-15 19:45:19 Lolu and Cee C are oil and water ,its going to be interesting #BBNaija

1728 2018-02-15 19:44:44 Welcome to the club! Burt’s Bees hand salve has been a godsend for me. Heals and clears up my eczema most of the time. Body oil cleanser helps too, in lieu of regular body soap.
1729 2018-02-15 19:44:09 Oil be my baby tonight #MakeASongSingle
1730 2018-02-15 19:44:07 Gave everyone a heads up when they started drilling, mid Jan. Then through out a few reminders. Now we are ready to move. Still drilling approx another week, but they have encountered oil & gas shows through out the horizontal drill, not much more you can ask for. Read the NRs
1731 2018-02-15 19:43:56 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.

1732 2018-02-15 19:43:39 Oil changed and tires aired. Ready for this drive to Riverside later....But I’m not looking forward to traffic
1733 2018-02-15 19:43:33 Mineral oil is apparently bad for your skin because it clogs your pores and can actually damage skin lining and increase water loss. It's the main ingredient in baby oil too. Tsk.
1734 2018-02-15 19:43:32 You  have an idiot problem who think it is fine to have Assault Rifle freely available with access to ammo The biggest sinners are those who are making vast profits and bribing politicians and the Politicians for accepting those bribes Oil & Gas Companies just the same collateral
1735 2018-02-15 19:43:29 So I put a few drops of eucalyptus oil in the bong water and it really helped my cold. Idk why I didn't think of it sooner!
1736 2018-02-15 19:43:01 You didn't use enough oil and you need to keep them sliding around if you use bare metal. However potstickers do turn out a bit better this way
1737 2018-02-15 19:42:57 CBD oil really helps
1738 2018-02-15 19:42:56 When your boyfriend shows up with massage oil I’m pretty sure that qualifies as being by far the best valentine’s day ever
1739 2018-02-15 19:42:43 We have 10 modular refinaries in the Niger delta ready for operation, Dangote refinary is almost ready and another one will be coming up on the Nigerien border. Global oil prices will most likely crash again and everything will be back to normal.
1740 2018-02-15 19:42:40 Thanks for sharing! The Maplight data, especially the breakdown on the oil money contributions to individual legislators, is very revealing - and surprising in some cases. #OilMoneyOut
1741 2018-02-15 19:42:07 Guys I FINALLY got an oil change...  @Cassidymae3 @iB_BNeil
1742 2018-02-15 19:42:03 so 12 players under 24 years old? Sorry Rob, the 80s are over. You can't win with a team full of kids. And how about the pipeline of outstanding prospects he was left with...
1743 2018-02-15 19:41:43 I’m looking on Amazon for an A+ CBD oil tincture. I don’t know if there’s a difference between 1000mg, 750mg, 500mg, 250mg as far as results. Price? Big differences. So many brands and so many claiming to be “pure.” So far I’m going by  ratings. Does anyone have a fave?
1744 2018-02-15 19:41:35 Rob Kauffman would make a great snake oil salesman

1755 2018-02-15 19:39:48 Don't use scented lotions or face washes!

Also Aquaphor is a gift from the gods tbh. Put some of that on it

1761 2018-02-15 19:39:28 Burning coal and oil not only causes climate change, it throws particles  into the air that can cause asthma, heart attacks and other health  problems. The WHO estimates that three million people die prematurely every year because of outdoor air pollution.

1764 2018-02-15 19:38:07 what did i do to deserve oil on canvas paintings
1765 2018-02-15 19:38:03 Trudeau is moving to purge all Conservatives from the NEB. They are looking to control the narrative moving forward. Big oil gets its pipelines and taxpayer subsidies, foreign countries get our coal and oil, and we get inflation on goods and services and carbon taxes.
1766 2018-02-15 19:37:55 coconut water is big trash. I love everything else coconut: oil, milk, cream, activated charcoal, even the (dried, toasted) flesh. but coconut water? I’d rather die

1772 2018-02-15 19:36:35 i've had eczema since i was 6, but depending on your skin type you may end up trying lots of solutions! i use baby oil after i shower, towel dry and then put on vitamin e oil. as always, everyone is different, so this may not work for you

1776 2018-02-15 19:36:06 Right, sure, which is why there's oil drilling right next to poor communities in Oklahoma and crops being sprayed with dangerous pesticides near houses in California.

1779 2018-02-15 19:35:37 I always make sure I get a layer of oil on each kernel before I put the pot on the stove - so popcorn in the pot, then add oil and swirl it around a bit before putting it on the stove. Usually get minimum defects.
1780 2018-02-15 19:35:25 Does throwing wet paper against the ceiling count? Then allegedly there was laxative in the ketchup. Then Idk if this actually happened but they said they would put oil or whatever in the east bottom hill

1788 2018-02-15 19:34:19 honestly using shitty sulfate-laden AXE shampoo on my extremely weird and finicky hair and then following up with nothing but jojoba oil to STILL maintain peak softness feels a little like cheating after an entire lifetime of spending far too much on fancy specialty hair products
1789 2018-02-15 19:33:54 Bruh... my nutrition professor just told us coconut oil is all hype... shook
1790 2018-02-15 19:33:52 If oil gets to 63/64. Dont suddenly get bullish. Thats going to be an OPPORTUNE time to short
1791 2018-02-15 19:33:44 I am so f**king sick of special interests (NRA, big pharma, oil) impeding on our society's progress. There were limits on contributions to politicians for a reason. Mostly so they wouldn't be whores for their donors. It's seriously time to get angry. I will not go down quietly if
1792 2018-02-15 19:33:33 I’m tryna get some oil but the bank is at the top of the hill and dispensaries don’t accept cards 
1793 2018-02-15 19:33:12 U.S. crude #oil futures settle at $61.17/bbl. $0.66. +1.09%. #CME #NYMEX #CL_J7 #OOTT

1795 2018-02-15 19:33:08 Indeed! Wouldn’t it be great if the grocery deliver van picked up the orange carrot head by mistake, drove off with him and cooked him in a HUGE pot of boiling oil! Oooh the smell! :( a girl can dream can’t she?
1796 2018-02-15 19:32:49 Summing it up, they paid for event and donated the rest.
1797 2018-02-15 19:32:39 Pay for your oil change #WeirdWaysToFlirt
1798 2018-02-15 19:32:04 Unfair question. We don't have high school measurements.

In addition, are we talking Greco-Roman, Freestyle, Scholastic, Sumo, WWE, Oil, etc?
1799 2018-02-15 19:31:56 Do Not put another Fed Tax on Gasoline !! It will be a direct hardship on the poor and it will be reflected at the Voting Booth !! The oil Speculators have driven gas prices way Too high now!! Don't let them do it !! Poor people can Not afford it !!
1800 2018-02-15 19:31:43 Unfortunately, a 'catastrophic' marine oil spill from a tanker or even a cargo vessel could wipe out endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales virtually overnight. #ExtinctionIsForever #ExxonValdez
1801 2018-02-15 19:31:31 Baby oil so clutch
1802 2018-02-15 19:31:27 “This is your air filter. This is what we call... terrible...” the nice Penzoil man to me while getting my oil changed and my car checked on.
1803 2018-02-15 19:31:21 You’re expecting reason from a guy who has a jug of oil as his avatar?
1804 2018-02-15 19:31:18 Snake oil seems to be all the rage I guess.
1805 2018-02-15 19:31:17 The quality of Oil playing Europa league 
1806 2018-02-15 19:31:14 I’ve had plenty of “off days” on my own, but today my entire crew is having an “off day”. This is gonna get interesting.... started 30 minutes into my shift, I covered myself in oil 
1807 2018-02-15 19:30:42 OIL DIFF: 3.13 -> 3.13
1808 2018-02-15 19:30:33 Add a bit of oil so they don't stick..um..I find that when the water starts to produce bubbles it's hot enough to dump them in.
1809 2018-02-15 19:30:33 Oil diffuser got you glowing lol
1810 2018-02-15 19:30:27 And this is what the little potato & ndps want to turn Canada into and they have a good start by not getting our oil out !

1813 2018-02-15 19:29:48 I could blow millions in the skincare and essential oil section of Whole Body
1814 2018-02-15 19:29:41 And not being able to fix things/ things being *worse* somewhere else DOES NOT MEAN people can't express outrage/ have opinions about current things. Keep using your voice, @amandapalmer The squeaky wheel does get the oil, eventually, if only to stop the NOISE #makesomenoise
1815 2018-02-15 19:29:30 Ty and I left our dishes from dinner out last night and there is a trail of olive oil paw prints across my kitchen table... this should be fun
1816 2018-02-15 19:29:27 I use 100% castor oil I bought it from rite aid there in fillmore it was like $7 I think I got it a year ago
1817 2018-02-15 19:29:15 My brother started taking fish oil supplements and says it's helped his eczema!! 
1818 2018-02-15 19:29:06 Give us 2% of the oil revenue. #jobdone
1819 2018-02-15 19:28:56 My skin is soooooooooooo fucked up right now  tea tree oil is the Devil
1820 2018-02-15 19:28:49 Layman.....oil in river!  ( just a little bit pregnant?)
1821 2018-02-15 19:28:46 I need an oil change. This is when i miss my father & where a boyfriend would be idealistic
1822 2018-02-15 19:28:07 White truffle oil potato chips from TJ’s are the most dangerous snacc
1823 2018-02-15 19:28:06 We absolutely have to get $ out of politics. Then the NRA or Big Oil or Pharmacies cannot buy Congress.
1824 2018-02-15 19:28:02 Yeah bro, fuck the Champions League. So overrated and filled with a bunch of oil money >>
1825 2018-02-15 19:27:57 Yes, but I might have slept with 2 or 3 of them.  Don't ask...Wesson Oil and lots of plastic were involved. 
1826 2018-02-15 19:27:38 1.5 c milk, 2 tbsp oil, 1 egg
1.5 c milk, 1 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt
Mix wet, mix dry, add wet to dry, mix for 10 seconds max. NO MORE.
Heat pan to medium/med-high. Melt butter. Add mix. ~90s per side.
Maple syrup or gtfo.
1827 2018-02-15 19:27:33 Sometimes i swear the people i follow on twitter are real life people in my real life. Our FNG in dispatch had an oil diffuser plugged in. Half the station smelled like it. 

Actually... come to think about it... it was an improvement.
1828 2018-02-15 19:27:26 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1829 2018-02-15 19:27:25 Well what can I say..... this valentines I finally managed to strip her down, oil her up, give her a thorough rodding and wiped her down after. Better put her back in the cabinet before the wife gets home. 
God I love my shotgun  
1830 2018-02-15 19:27:15 (BTW keep the log stove. Locally (meaning very locally)  and properly dried wood is still way better than oil/gas/etc....)
1831 2018-02-15 19:27:07 They can always join the Catalaniona and see if they'll let them tear apart Spain.... Sarcasm aside the Kurds already have a regional government in northern Iraq they are oil rich and like most landlocked countries rely on their allies in this case the Turks. 1/2
1832 2018-02-15 19:26:56 Cuadrilla and the other greedy oil tycoons must NOT touch Balcombe
1833 2018-02-15 19:26:45  potato and cooked beans are much better maybe a rice that is cooking with cooking oil and salt 
1834 2018-02-15 19:26:39 Gold must be mined. Oil. Diamonds. Natural gas. All that
1835 2018-02-15 19:26:38 The divorce would of course hit a problem with resource claiming. Leftist will suddenly become oil tycoons.
1836 2018-02-15 19:26:32 And the pharma companies!? What about Oil!? Our government isn't engaged in helping ANYTHING BUT THEMSELVES.

1838 2018-02-15 19:26:13 I added more oil to my elephant  and it has the office smelling so bomb
1839 2018-02-15 19:26:07 I just put on a new lipstick and it has clove oil in it. GAG. BARF. VOMIT.

I feel like I'm 17 years old again sneaking clove cigarettes. But like on my lips.
1840 2018-02-15 19:25:10 The Trump administration continues to turn back the clock by cutting $2 billion in funding for renewable energy and prioritizing kickbacks to the oil and gas industry. We cannot afford a #DirtyBudget.

1842 2018-02-15 19:25:01 @kindbarco not so kind! Stop the use of conflict palm oil that leads to deforestation and the loss of habitat for orangutans and other wildlife! #bekind #stopdeforestation #PalmOil
1843 2018-02-15 19:24:59 Have you seen turkish oil wrestling
1844 2018-02-15 19:24:33 Against oil price falling Always come conflicts; geopolitical tensions and even some missiles launched by drones. Oil price must be kept above 50$ othetwise... bad
1845 2018-02-15 19:24:32 When we Build the Wall will it keep Piers Morgan out of the USA !?!?
1846 2018-02-15 19:24:27 I need castor oil so my eyebrows can grow in fuller  last person who did my brows phucked them up
1847 2018-02-15 19:24:23 if i have to be honest with ya'll i still use johnson's baby oil... another one that works for me is the cocoa divine body oil gel from equate if i don't wanna use any medicated moisturizer
1848 2018-02-15 19:24:12 Ahh, I might give it a go then! Won't try the oil tho, it breaks me Tf out lol
1849 2018-02-15 19:24:04 I honestly believe he didn't expect anything other than what happened & wants to use it as fuel and that's perfectly fine. The thing I don't understand is going public with that angle...it serves absolutely no purpose...for anyone.
1850 2018-02-15 19:24:00 I wish I had friends here. I want someone to walk around with. I'm starting to miss Oil City. wtf
1851 2018-02-15 19:23:59 Troy-Bilt Review: About 3 years ago I purchased a trimmer/edger with tiller attachment,and a mower..mower won't stay running and trimmer leaks oil and fuel creating a fire hazard...$700.00 worth of equipment useless...Troy used to make good products not the case anymore...
1852 2018-02-15 19:23:24 I have normal, but my nose get oily, just on the tip, I'd suggest trying this and if you need something a bit more hydrating mix a *tiny* drop of face oil in it, it will also make it more dewy
1853 2018-02-15 19:22:57 Uhh yeah my Alabama husband corrected me its not oil babe its ol !! Lol I said oh just like my Albama girl laura lee ahha
1854 2018-02-15 19:22:45 Dept of Irony: As a biz columnist, I argued for the TM pipeline for yrs. In return, I was called a "shill" for Big Oil, an indy "mouthpiece," and an "embarassment" by lefties. Now that Notley is fighting for TM, she is praised as a "fighter" / "champion" for AB and Cda.
1855 2018-02-15 19:22:34 That's from all that Fresh Hawaiian Air. You're lungs aren't used to the miniscule dollops of oil saturating Edmonton's air.
1856 2018-02-15 19:21:59 Because the people who only accept a fictional space wizard, mock people who don't believe in half space wizard Jesus, are the ones enabling insane gun wielding unstable people to have guns and kill because they hate. You worship G(guns)O(oil)D(dollars).
1857 2018-02-15 19:21:56 I... won a free oil change??
1858 2018-02-15 19:21:47 Going live at 7pm est to answer these questions!!!
How do I pick a quality CBD Oil?  
What 5 questions should I ask before purchasing?
1859 2018-02-15 19:21:41 There is no high or low oil price. Just because a barrel went for $150 doesn't mean the price is low. There's just the possibility of not getting back to that price.
1860 2018-02-15 19:21:33 She's just being honest. No harm there. Agree it exposes the trickery at work. Ultimate goal of " common sense gun laws" = no guns.
1861 2018-02-15 19:21:25 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
1862 2018-02-15 19:21:20 The moment the next arctic monkeys album drops I'm going to only wear denim jackets, oil my hair, and wear ray bans indoors until the next one comes out
1863 2018-02-15 19:21:15 I’m so excited to get my Bio Oil in the mail 
1864 2018-02-15 19:21:04 #Gold #Oil Essence would love you to surprise me
1865 2018-02-15 19:21:03 i was so excited to use this new oil serum as a primer but it made my skin look disgusting :(
1866 2018-02-15 19:21:01 new oil?
1867 2018-02-15 19:20:57 Snake oil.
1868 2018-02-15 19:20:47 It's cooked in coconut oil.
1869 2018-02-15 19:20:43 Thanks for the invitation. It's actually a project I'm currently working on since hiking tours are not generally promoted to foreigners. Many people only know Trinidad for our oil and gas economy, carnival, and nothing more.
1870 2018-02-15 19:20:30 And trust the government to decide who is mentally ill?
I think not...
1871 2018-02-15 19:20:19 It’s a chemical explanation. Oil/varnish found on some pieces of furniture reacts to the silicone of the HomePod base
1872 2018-02-15 19:20:14 They certainly have a Texas oil pipeline strategy - and gosh darn they ain't for backin' down
1873 2018-02-15 19:20:10 pro tip: instead of shaving cream use coconut oil, you'll be extra soft and smell good 
1874 2018-02-15 19:19:58 Possible oil on the track

1876 2018-02-15 19:19:56 Going to try coconut oil instead of butter for my popcorn today, hope it doesn't suck!
1877 2018-02-15 19:19:51 Coconut oil!
1878 2018-02-15 19:19:41 Nope, he says it’s just mental illness.  NRA is rubbing him with oil and money under the table because he won’t dare admit there is a gun control problem.
1879 2018-02-15 19:19:31 Apparently replace oil is an advisory thing xx
1880 2018-02-15 19:19:30 They really about to set it off in jiffy lube over the shooting... I’m just hear to get my oil changed #onlyinDC

1882 2018-02-15 19:19:09 Some lady with bad eyebrows just tried to scam me out of paying more for an oil change and I peaced the fuck outta there bc no way am I letting someone with bad eyebrows fuck with me
1883 2018-02-15 19:18:54 I've been randomly catching an absolutely divine scent all day and I've just realized that the last time I wore this jacket, I also wore my favorite @bpal perfume oil
so it's me
I'm the divine scent
Thanks to BPAL 
1884 2018-02-15 19:18:49 Might be. But if he was really referring to William, theres must have been an original (in oil or print) to copy and there would have been the crown included, wouldn't it?
1885 2018-02-15 19:18:41 I haven’t gotten my eyebrows done in years... you not finna take what lil brows I got left... wait till this castor oil come in tho...

1887 2018-02-15 19:18:16 Stop digging, you struck Oil.  You had me at impeaching the President.
#ImpeachTrump
1888 2018-02-15 19:18:11 I care very deeply. A few facts to consider: shipping traffic has never been higher. Bilge oil leaked from run of the mill ships >>> hazard than safe tankers. The Marine ecosystems are dreadfully compromised by fish farms and raw sewage dumped from bc cities not oil from AB...
1889 2018-02-15 19:18:11 The gas taxes will be a boon for the oil companies .. How many pennies on the dollar will actually improve roads bridges tunnels etc ? 

Above all who will be accountable for these greedy unscrupulous CEO's to ensure it's channeled properly ? 

More on this later #Truckers
1890 2018-02-15 19:18:02 Part 2 George Washington supported military alliances that were useful.  Idiotic military alliances led to World War 1.  USA nationalized industries in World War 1, World War 2. Truman discussed importance of coal on net. Oil more important to Iran than coal to USA.
1891 2018-02-15 19:18:00 - I used to be able to drink 2 20ounce Redbulls everyday. Gave that shit up and will never look back. If I need energy Eucalyptus oil and organic Wheatgrass powder help for natural energy.

1893 2018-02-15 19:17:27 Who else really like $qcc? They clearly have a great tech for what is already in high demand : weed oil. They can sell to anyone with no gov restrictions. My only consern is big weed comps. already have their machines...what tech are they buying??

1908 2018-02-15 19:14:24 The stick dangled into my heating oil tank suggests it isn't empty. I will celebrate by switching on the heating for an hour.
1909 2018-02-15 19:14:20 If this super dirty oil goes anywhere, it should be shipped to east coast to get them away from importing oil from human rights abusing countries like Saudi Arabia and buying Canadian!
1910 2018-02-15 19:14:17 There’s like a whole eczema association and they have tons of great tips. They taught me to find a moisturizer with high oil content and not water as the water content can actually dry the skin more. Hope all this helps!!
1911 2018-02-15 19:14:09 Am at Conoil close to CAC Grammer school akure. We are placed on compulsory buying of oil (#1000) before any fuel is being sold. @InsideOndo

1914 2018-02-15 19:13:28 It's not a partisan issue despite painting it so. Dems like self defense and gun ownership too.
1915 2018-02-15 19:13:25 Thank you for your commitment to a strong federalism....please support my petition for a new NEP so we can radically redistribute Alberta oil profits...thanks in advance.

1918 2018-02-15 19:12:56 It was only political expediency that caused Premier Notley to get rid of Berman from the Oilsands Advisory group. Why was she appointed in the first place? NDPs secretly think oil and gas is dirty, despite what they may say. #ableg
1919 2018-02-15 19:12:44 I’ve been putting black castor oil on my eyebrows. They don’t look as thin as they used to 
1920 2018-02-15 19:12:44 Yeah baby oil
1921 2018-02-15 19:12:38 No fucking way. My children will not be cannon fodder for Westminster wars for oil. Let them send their kids to the front line. Oh and they can go with them. How anyone can support this when they see how the government treats those who survive beggars belief.
1922 2018-02-15 19:12:34 Hi Breanna, Hope you give the flash facial another try. We would also like to send you some samples of our Organic Omega Booster face oil. It will really help to nourish and soothe and calm your skin. please DM us your info

1927 2018-02-15 19:10:48 Three of the world’s biggest oil companies called on Norway to help maintain funding for carbon capture and storage technology that is stagnating amid concerns about whether it can ever be cost-effective.
1928 2018-02-15 19:10:46 Basically the gas masks that another one was quickly developed. this has created a society where many men do not burn fuel oil. Why? .
1929 2018-02-15 19:10:40 Here's one of my favorite pancake recipes:
1 1/4 cup flour 
2 tbsp sugar 
2 tsp baking powder 
1/2 tsp salt 
1 1/4 cup water
1 tbsp coconut oil
 *Directions*
Sift all dry ingredients in bowl 
Add oil and water

1930 2018-02-15 19:10:39 Thank you! I have a ton but it didn’t seem to make a difference  trying coconut oil today!
1931 2018-02-15 19:10:33 Lol. Aren’t the oil sands some of  the biggest polluters and natural disasters in the world? Maybe we should ban those while we’re at it.
1932 2018-02-15 19:10:23 Changed the oil filter cleaned my mass air flow sensor just about road trip ready
1933 2018-02-15 19:10:18 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。

1938 2018-02-15 19:09:57 No! I don't want any government agency putting anything in my car! Also, the cost would then just go up, no matter what the price of oil was.
1939 2018-02-15 19:09:56 Ohhh yeah! Had the 78 with a moon roof as my first car.
Drove the snot out of it, took a quart of oil for every tank of gas.
It taught me mechanics.

1940 2018-02-15 19:09:46 Putin understood this. And oil and gas.
1941 2018-02-15 19:09:42 A lighthouse cannot run on oil...  Which is whale oil, in this case...  It would smell too much...

A lighthouse must be an LED, to be visible for any distance...
1942 2018-02-15 19:09:41 “You prepare a table for me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and unfailing love will follow me all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” Psalms 23:5-6

1948 2018-02-15 19:09:04 Son, you really are young. The 70s through early 80s brought us a 10 year  bear stock market, stagflation, oil embargos/price shocks, large scale social unrest, rising confrontation with Russia, wide spread terrorism in Europe and massive currency shocks.
1949 2018-02-15 19:08:49 Do you know how the coconuts are mistreated to get that oil? No thanks

1951 2018-02-15 19:08:41 Man I switched mechanics last month- worst decision ever. Since I got my oil changed I am having problems with my ac, transmission, and power steering. New place screwed me
1952 2018-02-15 19:08:39 theres oil pastel in my eye
1953 2018-02-15 19:08:35 SOS. I need oil and I’m not 21.
1954 2018-02-15 19:08:23 I was too. I've since spoken to some neutral geologists not in the pay of the fracking/gas/oil lobby. Still wouldn't want it under my house though.

1959 2018-02-15 19:07:03 Because of palm oil.  Read your ingredients. Pressure food makers to not use it
1960 2018-02-15 19:07:00 a bit of olive oil and cinnamon, on for 20 mins, clears ur skin a bit makes it brighter
1961 2018-02-15 19:06:51 Great news!  Cheese‘s complex taste & texture needs patiently curing microbial organisms with fats, proteins and salts. Hard to get right with alternative ingredients eg coconut oil, so most vegan cheeses so far taste artificial, injecting fungi afterwards just isn’t the same
1962 2018-02-15 19:06:49 Hey guys! I have lots of bottles of my Hemp Oil up for grabs if you want to try as a sample. If interested and want to discuss further business message me and spread the word 
1963 2018-02-15 19:06:48 @bluegrassred I use an oil called Vetiver with my lavender at night to relax and sleep. I make a small spray bottle with water & spray on sheets. Do it for my kids, too. May help the grinding of teeth.
1964 2018-02-15 19:06:44 Madam I really thought you were highly educated & widely Read? Pls answer these questions:
1. Who created #nigeria?
2. How is a country created?
3. Can Oil & water mix together?

1965 2018-02-15 19:06:39 Convinced my baby sister to watch the @DeRayDavis netflix special. She says that Deray is evil as hell but she laughed out loud. Told her she would... Now we both need holy oil to repent for enjoying it so much

1971 2018-02-15 19:06:09 my hair is curly but i recently bought a bloe dryer with a diffuser attachment and it's life-changing!! i use a curl cream from royal locks but honestly most hair creams & leave-ins with argan oil etc are solid if they don't have sulfates/salt/alcohol/parabens
1972 2018-02-15 19:06:03 I hope you all had a wonderful valentine's!  Mine was very adult with workday and parentmeeting. Most romantic surprise I had this morning when the husband informed he had changed the car's oil ready, is the little big things :) #HappyValentinesDay
1973 2018-02-15 19:05:48 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
1974 2018-02-15 19:05:24 A mixture of olive oil and salt will remove that. Just rub in gently and leave to soak. Two hours later brush away excess salt.
1975 2018-02-15 19:05:19 Imagine if another unjust oil war pops up? Fuck that.
1976 2018-02-15 19:05:10 Sudanese refugees should stay in Sudan and not to be brought on Uganda streets to beg when they have oil being marketed by outsiders through leaders of Dinkas and Nuers.  People in S. Sudan should work towards making oil a contry's earning Product & avoid fighting each other.

1984 2018-02-15 19:04:00 Remember oil @ $1.13, £ as a millstone, EU legal advice, once in a generation? Even GERS - the basis of many of their 'no brainer' economic justifications has become #SchrodinGERS * 

They. Don't. Care.

* I'll get that hashtag trending if it's the last thing I ever do. Maybe.
1985 2018-02-15 19:03:45 They are the largest oil producer in the Caribbean. So electricity is probably much cheaper than normal.
1986 2018-02-15 19:03:36 send oil for brain
1987 2018-02-15 19:03:34 One could say the same about oil.
1988 2018-02-15 19:03:24 Peak has an Indica cartridge option now! That 9Lb Hammer has always been a solid Indica, especially when Peak is making the oil!
1989 2018-02-15 19:03:24 Olive oil ice cream is underrated .
1990 2018-02-15 19:03:23 Some lavender oil on your temples would help
1991 2018-02-15 19:03:11 Never thought about olive oil.....always used baby oil before. Great tip!
1992 2018-02-15 19:03:07 Have you read “Merchants of Doubt” by Naomi Oreskes? Tobacco companies did it. Oil companies do it and gun companies are doing it too.

1995 2018-02-15 19:02:49 As oil fields age such as the ME, tend to produce more gas they would like to sale to Europe by pipeline through Syria and Turkey. The Russian economy is based on sales of nat resources.  Take away gas sales to Europe and Russia will be in a big hurt
1996 2018-02-15 19:02:34 Not here.. I asked. They don't even send kids home unless they have "live lice"... their words.. 

That tree oil shampoo is on the list! Or whatever it's called.

1998 2018-02-15 19:02:12 Why oil price quants have furrowed brows, #OOTT :   The square root of yesterday's open added to yesterday's settle might equal today's high.  Vice versa for down market direction as well?  I think it's a quant thing.

2001 2018-02-15 19:01:58 Russia is taking over Syria’s oil and gas. Who could have seen that coming? 
2002 2018-02-15 19:01:57 My take is although we need oil for the time being we shouldn't be building even more pipelines and endangering our ecosystems for said oil. We should be funding green renewable energy and trying to fix this disaster we've created on this planet.

2013 2018-02-15 19:00:12 A pipeline would have prevented the massive burning of oil during this winter's cold snap. I'd love more clean energy, but NE lacks the will to build the amount of wind, solar and hydro transmission needed to replace fossil fuel gen. I just don't see 100% renewable as realistic.

2028 2018-02-15 18:58:01 So I'm getting my oil changed and this guy was like it's gonna be 60 unless a filter is dirty or whatever last time they did. I left paying like 175 extra. Not happening today
2029 2018-02-15 18:57:36 That rings a bell. Think he had done another 99+ lap & was on his way to first ton 250 & the win he was robbed of in 61 (when I think all the oil  blew out) Mac never finished a TT on a Honda but won plenty other races on them
2030 2018-02-15 18:57:36 My car is a mess, I need an oil change, I'm almost out of gas, and my tire is super low. I'm kind of embarrassed considering a total stranger is about to get in it to fix it.
2031 2018-02-15 18:57:10 Oil cartel?
2032 2018-02-15 18:57:05 @RachelNotley imagine if you will that Sask has oil that they want to send to the states but in order to do that they have to get thru AB. And spills are imminent & will destroy AB's hunting grounds.and all on AB are against it. Wwyd?
2033 2018-02-15 18:57:03 I use their coffee scrub, dry oil spray, and their body butter. The coffee scrub almost feels like a mousse and the body butter literally feels like butter.

2050 2018-02-15 18:54:06 The problem is not the NRA nor the GOP, the problem is Citizens United which allows entities like NRA and Big Pharma and the Oil Industry, Banking, insurance etc to buy our politicians and influence the laws which effect every American in ways which only benefit themselves.
2051 2018-02-15 18:54:03 Love when mfs try to oil slick
2052 2018-02-15 18:54:01 This is what’s so sad about politics. Special interest groups like the NRA, PP, oil, etc. have too much power in our elections and over our politicians preventing common sense compromises from getting done. I support 2nd amendment rights, but am canceling my NRA membership.
2053 2018-02-15 18:53:33 Where does the gas and oil that BC uses, come from?  Check Google. Our gas comes from the US.  The oil from Alberta is just passing through BC to be exported.
2054 2018-02-15 18:53:22 Does it involve a snake and some oil?
2055 2018-02-15 18:53:21 super uncomfortable to buy condoms outside of a self check out. so i slid those into marathon with oil, funions, zero cal powerade, high hopes, camo gloves, and chapstick. 

“i don’t want my receipt. and stop looking at me.”
2056 2018-02-15 18:53:12 The seeds and oil just makes the spicy better. chef kiss emoji.
2057 2018-02-15 18:53:11 It's not the pipeline it's about the oil sludge silly. It is not good for the health of Canadians, all Canadians.
2058 2018-02-15 18:53:07 same with other industries (like car industry and their oil partners, and why EVs are tried to not exist, food industry wants to continue to kill it's tens of billions of animals a year, etc..). driving force: money. most successful place to thrive? america.

2060 2018-02-15 18:52:39 We only employ about 25 people, but will be looking to hire 5 or 6 more soon. Is that an example of trickle down not working? I invest in oil and natural gas companies on the stock market.

2064 2018-02-15 18:52:19 USA plunders the planet for the oil to fuel this insanity

2066 2018-02-15 18:52:01 A great thing about oil is less smoke and it doesn’t really smell.

2073 2018-02-15 18:50:45 Great article! Still, I have reservations. Ever noticed an oil slick on the surface of the coffee in your cup? That’s oil from coffee beans that are insoluble in water, but they’re in your cup, just as there is safrole oil in sassafras tea, conspiracy theories notwithstanding.
2074 2018-02-15 18:50:41 That's unfortunate ... not only am I nowhere near Japan (so no opportunity to buy), but also have never dabbled in that medium (oil paints are on a whole new level of artwork for me)
2075 2018-02-15 18:50:19 Yes you guys would certainly lose a lot less, but I doubt the US gov would want to lose out on the oil sands, considering it's the second largest oil deposit next to the Saudis. There's way too many variables however to consider overall. Worst comes to worst there's always the EU
2076 2018-02-15 18:50:16 I work in oil and gas. Chevron, Phillips, and others pay me and pay me well. They are constantly expanding and repairing their infrastructure. The more they do, the more people my company will hire to meet demands. In fact, we’ve been discussing it all year.

2095 2018-02-15 18:47:25 Cork can be formed to replace the silicone part exactly. It’s generally just a thin layer of cork glued onto a shaped piece. Not sure this would help as I think the ring is caused by intense vibrations to the small contact area “frothing” up the oil.
2096 2018-02-15 18:47:24 I love, LOVE, going to get an oil change and being spoken to like I’m a brainless imbecile who’s never even seen the inside of a vehicle. Also,being called “sweetheart” while being spoken to like this, is grand.

2100 2018-02-15 18:47:10 Russia's claiming the Canadian Arctic, other countries too. They're drilling for oil in Siberia & it's the same geological formation which extends into Canada. Good luck with their claims (not really!), since no other country ever did anything for Inuit populations.

2111 2018-02-15 18:45:34 I think I'll take my car to get an oil change today 
2112 2018-02-15 18:45:31 was just thinking about this: you pay big money to add fresh oil to your car. but adding oil to your body is unhealthy? makes no sense

2115 2018-02-15 18:44:42 I did. I learned that if Alberta cut off all oil and gas to BC, gas prices would maybe spike 20cents temporarily, likely settling back to mean quickly. Meanwhile, Alberta would have spare crude capacity that nobody really wants.

2119 2018-02-15 18:44:06 Sorry people. I’m all for decreasing our emissions and using as little as possible the limited oil reserves. Oil however is what makes our society what it is. You remove oil, you essentially take us back to the mid-1800’s. Oil is more than fuel, it’s what makes your life possible
2120 2018-02-15 18:44:00 Definitely, research brings innovation. Renewable source of energy is need of the future as oil to vanish.
2121 2018-02-15 18:43:52 My friend has one she said the oil change is expensive but she only has to get it done once a year. So it probably evens out
2122 2018-02-15 18:43:50 Oh good god man get yourself some hand cream STAT!!

2140 2018-02-15 18:41:55 I agree, your statement about SDF 'seizing' oil fields is laughable. Everyone knows that, even pro-rebels.
2141 2018-02-15 18:41:50 So you like fries, huh? It's like ripping a living thing from its home, peeling back its skin, cutting it, and then dipping it into scalding oil, all the while enjoying sweet silence since it has no mouth with which to scream.

2146 2018-02-15 18:40:48 If Crude Oil was to continue higher, I believe it would still need to test $59 because this is not a bullish base. Below 50 sma is not bullish, and was already rejected. Higher probability is $55-56 within 2 weeks max. @Simple_Trends @Bamabroker

2156 2018-02-15 18:39:49 Do not increase tax upon the public.  Instead make the Oil giants pay the increased taxation from their profits.  Until 1913 when amendment 16 was ratified, No double taxation was allowed. Rescind Amendment 16 and lets live as Freemen, who shed the Royal UK  Yoke of heavy taxes.

2172 2018-02-15 18:38:19 Though the oil embargo in the 1970’s was a “manufactured crisis”, it helped pushed energy efficiency innovations in our country like climate change has in recent years. Cheap energy is easy to waste thus it takes situations like these to drive change.

2182 2018-02-15 18:36:55 I'm a big fan of jojoba oil because it most accurately mimics the natural sebum of your face! Definitely a great oil.
2183 2018-02-15 18:36:40 The NOPA crush report for Jan 2018 was more than 2 million bushels less than trade expectations at 163.1 million bu.

2204 2018-02-15 18:33:32 Esta es una emergencia: la administración Trump está corriendo para abrir grandes extensiones de nuestra costa para la perforación costa afuera.
El plan no tiene precedentes y otorga a Big Oil un pase gratis para perforar en el 90% de nuestros océanos y poner en riesgo a las
2205 2018-02-15 18:33:11 Large amounts of oil and clean water, also, most of your bread has canadian wheat in it.
2206 2018-02-15 18:33:01 dei, no oil jokes. we only want IT jokes
2207 2018-02-15 18:32:58 I need some tea tree oil.
2208 2018-02-15 18:32:58 The ONLY thing that helped me was a bath&surround myself in lavender oil. Now I just talk myself down. But lavender oil is ever present.
2209 2018-02-15 18:32:39 Hey Jason, why don’t you calculate the cost benefit of BUILDING YOUR OWN REFINERY AND SELLING PETROLEUM instead at a higher price then depreciated Canadian heavy oil! And KEEPING IT IN CANADA / USA.
2210 2018-02-15 18:32:36 @pbhushan1 ne to islamic oil money ko pura chusa hai but tune to usko bhi joote maar bahar Kar diya kejri,tune kitna khaya hai?? How do you sleep at night?? Who r ur idols Aurangzeb? WTF
2211 2018-02-15 18:32:35 Legal bribery ... aka lobbying.., is the problem! NRA , big oil, tobacco... the list goes on... the only reason this is still legal is because the lawmakers benefit from not changing lobbying... democracy shouldn’t have a price tag!
2212 2018-02-15 18:32:29 One thing about me nobody slicker than me ... I’m not even slick I’m oil . So if you think bout crossing me , better never trust me 
2213 2018-02-15 18:32:20 .@Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
2214 2018-02-15 18:32:07 I was weak when I watched her saying it. Like seriously? Anything happens to the price of oil now and we are in big trouble. I'm tired. Let me face my life, biko.
2215 2018-02-15 18:31:52 It all centers around Carter doesn't it? They used him as a patsy bc of his business ties to Russia & his influence in getting the 19% of Russian Oil Stock. The Russian women in the meeting were living down from Nikolas Cruz & the Deep State got em during the False Flag to quiet.

2218 2018-02-15 18:31:07 They say cats are more sensitive, but again, none of this information is even confirmed!! It’s just random articles on the internet. It could be people who are putting too much oil in the diffuser in combination with the non-pure oils? Who knows honestly 
2219 2018-02-15 18:31:02 VADM Franklin: We're hopeful Libyans can come to a single-nation solution to their current problems. Country isn't working as it is, but it's not entirely broken either. Oil still being pumped, wages being paid, etc
2220 2018-02-15 18:30:52 how much does a tank that size cost to build?
Also can you tell how much oil is in it from the shadow?  as in does it rise and fall with how much oil is in it or is it rigid.  (i've seen other pictures where the shadows are highlighted in red like they are important and why iask)
2221 2018-02-15 18:30:37 Anti-aging hand treatment: soak your hands in milk for 15 minutes. Rinse, then apply a bit of olive oil on them.
2222 2018-02-15 18:30:31 His Tax idea is People Pointed. Instead, make the Oil Giants pay that increased tax from their Profits.  Individual taxation was ruled unconstitutional by the SCOTUS until Amendment 16 was passed in 1913.  No Double Taxation was allowed.  Rescind amendment 16.
2223 2018-02-15 18:30:29 Strong oil prices, refinery profits boost Cenovus earnings
2224 2018-02-15 18:30:17 used correctly, i would call it more mood altering than straight up intoxicating. and its an important part of why i find it so helpful for sleep and stress. now, for pure physical ailments like epilepsy, obviously a non mood altering version like pure cbd oil is preferrable.

2232 2018-02-15 18:29:16 Probably best we don't refer to the snake oil peddled from both sides. But hey, all are entitled to opinions, whatever data those are based on.
2233 2018-02-15 18:29:15 I like greasy worm for you... Is that oil? It looks so slimy.
2234 2018-02-15 18:29:13 I had the oil tank removed from my property several years ago. It cost me hundreds of dollars more because I had to pay for JCPD to be there. The officer pretty much sat in is car the entire time.
2235 2018-02-15 18:29:05 Its not a dem or rep thing. Shit it aint even a black or white thing. Its about that green. Its the haves n the have nots. The nra, wall street, big oil n the koch bros run this shit. Dont think for a second that trump n your precious gop have your best interest in mind.
2236 2018-02-15 18:28:49 One problem not mentioned is how many times the Oilers went for Oil Kings specific players because of how easy and how many times they saw them. How many of them actually panned out?
2237 2018-02-15 18:28:42 So afraid of climate change and oil that they wear clothing made from petroleum.... Shouldn't they be wearing all cotton and hemp ....
2238 2018-02-15 18:28:33 Sure.  But running the same playbook as the oil crisis makes it easier to know where and when to place your bets
2239 2018-02-15 18:28:14 Ooo hun trust me she had a collection of these.
And did you know that it's made from castor oil?
2240 2018-02-15 18:28:02 That's to be expected, we could have had these internal combustion engine efficiencies 30 years ago, but hey big oil was in the driving seat, that's no longer the case
2241 2018-02-15 18:28:01 Nice comebacks this week in #cattle and #oil. Jun 19 #cattle being the short side of most bull spreads in the complex-still like it as a stand alone long. And technicians will be watching $gold and the 1240 no. on fri close.

2245 2018-02-15 18:27:27 Oil money Ruperts money no big difference Wee clubs swollen with tv cash reappearing after decades of doing little or nothing
2246 2018-02-15 18:26:57 Glad that people dont live in Ocean, else America would hav invaded them for water as they did for Oil
2247 2018-02-15 18:26:40 Will industry just fish on regardless until the popular fish species have been driven to extinction? Will the the oil & gas industries just do the same ... Driven on by the Sod it & Profit routine ? .. pollute and profit at any cost. Will they  ever wake up to what they have done
2248 2018-02-15 18:26:37 Just bought something in Aesop and they offered me samples.

"Would you consider cleansing with an oil?" she asks, in a tone that would suit "have you ever buried a corpse in the woods"
2249 2018-02-15 18:26:31 Salesman: What you...6'1-6'2? Come over to my table, let me get you in a Suburban

Me: Im here for an oil change, sir.

2251 2018-02-15 18:26:02 I have heard this often. At what temp can you cook with olive oil? For how long?
2252 2018-02-15 18:25:57 scooty ka pickup sahi nahi sayad oil change karwa ke chase karo
2253 2018-02-15 18:25:54 There out of filters for my car to get an oil change every time I try to go.. I’ve been trying to get my oil changed for like a month now
2254 2018-02-15 18:25:47 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
2255 2018-02-15 18:25:33 I’ve read a lot of controversy around the topic. A lot of people are saying that it’s those non-pure oils that are making pets sick or people putting too much oil in their diffuser. But I’ve always been careful with it, and it’s good to be aware of the potential dangers.
2256 2018-02-15 18:25:22 We need to strike oil asap instead of stealing it from others

2259 2018-02-15 18:24:45 Why do we have to slow our cars in a school zone?  To protect children!  If our founding fathers had written a constitutional amendment allowing us freedom to drive as fast as we want, would the auto industry and big oil have lobbied lawmakers to prevent school-zone speed limits?
2260 2018-02-15 18:24:35 Everything else you read about the international oil "game" is skullduggery and Da Vinci Code style nonsense.
2261 2018-02-15 18:23:45 Oil chala gaya...

"Primary Organization of Oil Trading Sovereigns"   #POOTS
2264 2018-02-15 18:23:30 They sold all the oil the could produce before there was shale, and they'll sell all they can after. They'd rather have high prices than low prices, but that's largely a function of not having a lot of investment abroad, and not destroying demand with rapid fluctuations.
2265 2018-02-15 18:23:29 I always thought one of my friends smelled weird...I just found her body oil under my sofa and realize now it’s the oil she wears. I’m buying her perfume today as a #ThankYouForBeingAFriend gift, then throwing her oil in the trash. 
2266 2018-02-15 18:23:05 2. When cooked, transfer the omelette to a chopping board and cut into small pieces - about 2cm squares.
In the same wok, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and fry the bacon until crispy.  #foodiethursday
2267 2018-02-15 18:22:17 Favorite line - ‘I’m a mechanic I’ll do it myself ‘ .. yet you’re here letting us change your oil 
2268 2018-02-15 18:22:15 I think joint control over oil fields
2269 2018-02-15 18:21:56 You and Congress have failed the Children in these SC hi oil shootings you are all to blame for being cowards and not standing up against the NRA and for cutting Menral Health funding! 18 school shootings in 45 days is unacceptable!!!
2270 2018-02-15 18:21:55 I read a book a while back that detailed what would happen to economies and our daily lives if oil was gone completely. The impact was significant
2271 2018-02-15 18:21:53 Got a much needed oil change yesterday...Lol
2272 2018-02-15 18:21:47 @labourlewis @alexburghart 
From an economic perspective

it might be worthwhile to find-out 
to where all the Oil revenues went ?

As a second string one might ask
who owns the LA wealth which was given away by Right to Buy ?

2278 2018-02-15 18:20:21 how about where all that money collected by the govt when large companies were sued on behalf of the taxpayers (wells fargo, penalties for oil spills, etc)- it didn't go to those that were impacted it went to pet projects of those affiliated with the administration.
2279 2018-02-15 18:20:17 I literally own one essential oil. One. I don’t understand why people think I have them all over my house 
2280 2018-02-15 18:20:10 You seems forgetting Taliban was one of the wealthiest terrorist organization. Drug , human trafficking, oil, organ trafficking, wealthy partners, they had income..
2281 2018-02-15 18:19:58 Will @Saudi_Aramco, the Oil Giant Company, be listed in Hong Kong stock exchange? As it’s chief says it will allow access to Chinese investors. Now @HKEXGroup is competing against @NYSE & @LSEplc the question is that how  the Regulatory Competition will look like in the future?
2282 2018-02-15 18:19:56 Oil changes and the standard maintenance for like 60,000 miles 74,500 and like 86,000 whatever teirs the shop recommend will keep it running good shit.
2283 2018-02-15 18:19:55 I'm glad they specified 'goo' and not 'oil'

2286 2018-02-15 18:19:29 It,ll be more better to deploy the rising price of crude oil to power.if that is addressed other things will follow.The problems of youth unemployment in Nig is as a result of inefficient source of power to support local companies and subsequently relocations of  companies fm Nig
2287 2018-02-15 18:19:29 Definitely will try this thank you  I usually use sage essential oil on my tum but gonna get this kind
2288 2018-02-15 18:19:19 I agree with your sentiment, but demanding that Trump adopt a code of ethics is like telling Exxon to stop selling oil. Ain't gonna happen.

2291 2018-02-15 18:19:00 He invented the process of roasting & grinding up peanuts and a type of paste. He didn't make a recipe of adding salt, sugar, & oil to it to create a butter. People took his peanut flour & paste & did this. It all stemmed from him though. I don't want to downplay him, he's a hero
2292 2018-02-15 18:18:56 OK, first time I really paid attention to it.  Heard Steve Harvey told a joke about him wiping it off his co-workers forehead because he thought it was oil (at the time they worked at a car repair shop) and the ash was not in a distinct cross.  the coworker was quite peeved
2293 2018-02-15 18:18:52 HAHA ~ This is her way of justifying her 'Trumpesque' style trade war. If she loves oil so much, she should defect...with all the endangered oil biz fossils she is employed by.
2294 2018-02-15 18:18:49 Palm Oil Is Used in Damn Near All Processed Food. Stop Buying Crap.
2295 2018-02-15 18:18:34 We should avoid palm oil and products containing it to avoid Borneo's orangutan to become extinct. No biscuits, cakes, cosmetics containing palm oil.
2296 2018-02-15 18:18:27 Imagine if Alberta initiated it, instead of living off the fat of years past (recent from what I understand, not that long ago it was too expensive for oil sands to really be invested in) and I even remember reading the unpaid royalties... sad situation, so ripe for change

2305 2018-02-15 18:16:53 When you think how long it is taking for electric car sales to pick up (most likely due to big oil industry lobbyists hindering electric car development) then it's likely autonomous vehicles will not be common for many years.
2306 2018-02-15 18:16:42 I asked Lil Lola for some hair oil and she going to say some she got vegetable oil

2310 2018-02-15 18:16:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, or illegal immigration.
2311 2018-02-15 18:16:07 YESSSSS!!! Fuck you and your Fish Oil Money #OSTvAFC
2312 2018-02-15 18:16:02 watch rates here if they go up financials follow and small caps will aslo folo  (if oil holds)
2313 2018-02-15 18:15:59 SDF didn't seize anything, ISIS handed over the oil fields without fighting due to amount of ex-ISIS recycled in SDF.
2314 2018-02-15 18:15:53 suspending hardware in mineral oil is interesting ...

but using fans designed for AIR flow is ... suboptimal 

he should have designed a better solution for circulating the oil if there is even need to actively circulate it ...
2315 2018-02-15 18:15:43 The citizens in the rural areas have been cheated for long.  Most developments are at the capital. If this bill is passed,  there will be increased inclusiveness and reduction of poverty. 
So bro,  note that this is the ideal and not about the oil producing states. I'm from kd

2321 2018-02-15 18:14:43 Weve consistantly funded and trained rebel groups in the middle east, then called them our enemys, created wars trading weapons for oil, opium and slaves, weve also utilized the balkans to a lesser extent
2322 2018-02-15 18:14:41 at least 200% more productive than usual!! it is penne and it is plain because im basic but theres some olive oil in there at least
2323 2018-02-15 18:14:41 Hopefully they don't ask anything about the BP oil spill in the gulf from a while back.
2324 2018-02-15 18:14:37 They're dumplings but I will concede to there being a dumpling-pasta venn diagram (ravioli are in the middle). I think it needs some sort of sauce maybe to qualify as pasta? Hence potstickers are dumplings but wontons in chili oil, pasta.
2325 2018-02-15 18:14:36 Gotta agree! It's like a John K cartoon leapt into a Bob Ross oil painting spectacular work Donna! :)
2326 2018-02-15 18:14:29 Yet again, oil being ramped up after European close; happened yesterday as well and a few weeks ago like clockwork. Don't know what the motive is here

2328 2018-02-15 18:14:14 Need to use a generator to pick the winner of the essential oil giveaway then post about it

2329 2018-02-15 18:14:14 Neither were the dinosaurs....something has to replenish the oil supplies
2330 2018-02-15 18:14:07 So to be able to slow down climate change long enough to come up with an alternative is s righteous goal. No need for tar sands. Theirs plenty of conventional oil being extracted worldwide.

2456 2018-02-15 17:56:25 the biggest thing to do in car maintenance is 1. never let gas get below 1/4 tank (keeps junk out of fuel system) 2. change oil every 3000 miles.. not matter what, broke down oil starts causing engine issues 3. rotate tires every 6mos (keeps treads even) 4. check brake pads often

2458 2018-02-15 17:56:05 one of my vitamins with fish oil in it broke open and now I am certain that there is no hope and we have been abandoned
2459 2018-02-15 17:56:05 I joke about eating the rich but believe you me the moment the revolution comes I'm gonna be out there with a cast iron pan and olive oil ready to sautee their candy asses with onions
2460 2018-02-15 17:56:04 I fucking HATE when the dealership changes my oil when I take the truck in for maintenance because then when I go to do it a 15 min job takes 5 fucking hours because they tighten the oil filter down so much that I can never get it off 
2461 2018-02-15 17:56:02 Hi I live in Albuquerque, where it is really dry and we are having our bats break very frequently. How often do you think I should oil my bats ? Thanks
2462 2018-02-15 17:55:59 You put the coconut oil on the scalp.. #imakemyownlyrics 
2463 2018-02-15 17:55:39 Dropped $400 on new tires plus an oil changed. Now I have to get more work done on my car?! And it’s a 2016 model.. #wtf #ihatefords

3:48: "Use petrol instead of oil, it's harder to clean"
2469 2018-02-15 17:54:55 Oh well I suppose it’s better than being blown up by your own government in order to incite a race hate filled war over oil. ......And the award for the Biggest American terrorist ever.......... AMERICA well done my friend well done 
2470 2018-02-15 17:54:47 So the West Virginia House Of Delegates is run by oil and gas. Good to know.

2476 2018-02-15 17:54:25 Dear @POTUS,

A .25 #GasTax is a bad idea because it hits working families and causes negative GOP political feelings.  

Don't let fat dem cat Gary Cohen convince you to suggest this.

Levy excise tax on excess oil company profits to pay #InfrastructurePlan.
2477 2018-02-15 17:54:15 They Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, in June 2008, for Exxon's LaBarge / Shute Creek gas processing plant.
2478 2018-02-15 17:53:50 My job is picking up waste oil/diesel/antifreeze. I just happened to see this waterfall when I was passing by.
2479 2018-02-15 17:53:41 None of that Alberta oil is used domestically. We import oil for that. BC makes it's own natural gas, thank-you; we simply don't need Alberta for energy.
2480 2018-02-15 17:53:21 明らかに意識されたうすさなんだよな……
2481 2018-02-15 17:53:12 There are some but not nearly enuf & not nearly loud enuf. What a Dem should say; "You notice a pattern here? When it comes to econ, GOP sides w/1% donors, when it comes to environment, they side w/oil $, when it comes to gun violence, they side w/NRA $, THEY DON'T SIDE WITH YOU.
2482 2018-02-15 17:53:10 Looks good to me.., The environmentalists would have zero influence in Mexico they'd begin drilling for oil as soon as they could build the rigs.

2485 2018-02-15 17:52:48 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
2486 2018-02-15 17:52:45 We need to stop supporting the palm oil indstury. It’s pervasive in many cosmetics and foods.
2487 2018-02-15 17:52:44 Crude Oil:  $0.015 per oz
Milk:  $0.02 per oz
Dom Perignon Champagne:  $4.54 per oz
Human Blood:  $10.83 per oz
Chanel No. 5 Perfume:  $22 per ounce
Liquid Ink for Common Inkjet Printer:  $32.99 per oz and more! 
so .70 per page at 5%. and besides color printing is a fad ;^)
2488 2018-02-15 17:52:26 I should add that I think that what you are arguing is the case for other issues, but that the NRA and 2nd amendment supporters are significantly different than say nonprofits advocating for less regulations on oil and gas or lower taxes on the rich.

2494 2018-02-15 17:51:11 Who said anything about comparing... you brought the overly used “owned by a middle eastern oil baron” statement and I brought out the “Energy Drink FC” statement... Just 2 unoriginal claims
2495 2018-02-15 17:51:06 You can do entry level photography for the cost of a few tubes of oil paint.
2496 2018-02-15 17:51:04 Should we give up on primer.? I kinda have cause I have super oily skin and I just use a setting powder to kinda keep my oil at bay. At then and of the say ima be oily so there's no point anymore.
2497 2018-02-15 17:50:58 I graduated in 70. I was last 2 receive an regents honors degree. Meant 2 assure a scholarship. Thats when the FIRST oil recession hit and BOOM no scholarship no jobs My 1st job was pumping gas was told b/c of shortages ppl would riot. was told to lock up and run if that happened

2500 2018-02-15 17:50:33 Lobbyist groups and $$ in politics has screwed up the legis. system horribly. I don't think it's wrong for anyone to point fingers at the NRA, big oil or food/drink groups and say "you're the problem". But arguing about which one to tackle 1st means we'll never end up w/solutions
2501 2018-02-15 17:50:29 Andy, the @liberal_party know the value of our natural resources, they also know the importance of invention, green energy, science, to name a few. They know the importance of having a diverse economy, the PC's have taught us well what happens when they only count on oil
2502 2018-02-15 17:50:27 You're right!We DO need to invest in innovation & sustainable energy!We couldn't agree with you more-but unfortunately, we're not there yet!Renewable energy can't meet our energy demand & isn't reliable(yet) for our cold winters.We need another solution,but until then,we need oil
2503 2018-02-15 17:50:14 Thinking small is better than being delusional. GDP of US is 1/5 of the GDP of the entire world. By your logic xrp is about to replace all currencies worldwide, every crypto, all transactions in every industry:oil, manufacturing,banks, infrastructure, stocks, even pentagon... etc

2506 2018-02-15 17:50:09 Me too.  I'm not giving up my brussell sprouts, kale, cabbage, or cauliflower cooked in coconut oil and covered in good salt.  Delicious!
2507 2018-02-15 17:50:08 Way too much oil, the fire is too high
2508 2018-02-15 17:49:52 What is keeping oil prices down?  Active transportation, more public and use of public transit and energy efficiency.  There are some things that at this time cannot replace the need for oil.  But now we have a longer future to develop those, without deprivation
2509 2018-02-15 17:49:47 Anyone know of a really good hair growth supplement? Oil? Herbs? Juju? Anything?!
2510 2018-02-15 17:49:46 Sure. Do it, fuck it. Everyone ride bikes. Oil would become far more useless and CO2 emissions would go down, and everyone would be healthier.
2511 2018-02-15 17:49:44 Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
2512 2018-02-15 17:49:23 It starts from the very top down. Keep businesses out of politicians pockets. NO MORE PRIVATE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. Government provides equal funding for all campaigning. NO MORE NRA,PHARMACEUTICAL, OIL or INSURANCE company campaign contributions. Not 1 more dollar!

2519 2018-02-15 17:48:52 I’ve worked with Travis for over a year, and I can recommend them! Hard working, writes high quality code.

But they need to improve their work/life balance. I’ve noticed them burning the midnight oil once too often! And they’re far too quiet in team discussions.


2520 2018-02-15 17:48:27 The US and UK who foisted Buhari on Nigerians did so in order to have ease of doing business of oil and not about catching a thief because Buhari's criminal proclivity is well known to the West.Remember the issue of 53 suit cases in 1984 was leaked to the Nigerian intelligence

2531 2018-02-15 17:46:50 Oh, the jobs are there in the oil patch, as long as people keep wanting to use the product. But no corporation is going to sink millions and millions of dollars into building a refinery with an insecure market for oil.

2544 2018-02-15 17:44:49 of course the fuel for the Space Shuttle main engines could be the new oil, but it would really be Uranium for power plants for all the new electric cars & the Lithium for their batteries... just like food, control the supply of a needed commodity, you control the people...
2545 2018-02-15 17:44:39 course its far fetched.. what can an envoy do when the population itself is vested in the plunder of its own nation under competing loyalties.. 

Ur idea is gud but without an agreement on a diff governing structure for oil cash theyll agree temporarily. get it. then fight again.

2552 2018-02-15 17:44:07 Sorry. This point is simply false. The IEA & many authors debunked this years ago. A volcanic lake is nothing like an oil field. 

There have been two CO2 releases (from a pipeline and one from a well in CO in 1985). No one harmed, incl. the operators.

2558 2018-02-15 17:43:24 I think you're missing the point (though you are correct). #QAnon posted about WATER yesterday. Water was about to replace oil as the most valuable and coveted natural resource on earth. The Hivites want to control the water. Control the water - control the people who need it.

2579 2018-02-15 17:40:53 7/ Offshore drilling projects often take a long time to bear fruit, given our limited knowledge of how much oil and gas is even underneath the sea and the complexity of seismic testing and setting up offshore drilling rigs.
2580 2018-02-15 17:40:50 This government was paid for by oil and gas billionaires, we saw this coming.  Now, how do we fix it?
2581 2018-02-15 17:40:50 Was looking for one last movie screen grab for my talk (that's the theme) and started watching Armageddon looking for an oil drilling scene.

It really is the perfect movie. You can argue good or bad, but the writing for a Summer Blockbuster action film is perfection.

2586 2018-02-15 17:40:23 I think that all of the Oilers drafting woes could be fixed if they just put out a memo saying that scouts will be fired immediately if they try to convince (insert GM here) to draft anybody who has ever played for the Oil Kings.
2587 2018-02-15 17:40:21 …ぐぅ
2588 2018-02-15 17:40:08 Endless oil story
2589 2018-02-15 17:40:08 Semantics.  When ur economy requires stable $ prediction of oil, you do what you gotta do.  OPEC is a perfect example of that.  Not a lot of besties outside the meeting, but they keep their eyes on the prize.  RUS has seen the benefit, this past year, and the pain, the 3 before.
2590 2018-02-15 17:40:04 Home made chicken tikka saag balti & garlic rice for tea, only a tablespoon of olive oil!!  Low cal, and my favourite food!!  
2591 2018-02-15 17:39:48 the tide pod vape makes me remember how i used to vape and collect like a dozen bottles of vape oil with different types of just mango flavor
2592 2018-02-15 17:39:45 Wow, that is special.
2593 2018-02-15 17:39:43 Warning, The Warmth, Dig, Oil & Water, and Admiration. Wish You Were Here is always great too. Warning live might be the best of the bunch.
2594 2018-02-15 17:39:33 Body oil >>>>> lotion
2595 2018-02-15 17:39:24 6/ an Associated Press analysis of 36 years of data found, “More oil production in the United States does not mean consistently lower prices at the pump.” This will be all the more true since Congress repealed the crude oil export ban in 2015.
2596 2018-02-15 17:39:24 Really sad for all inocent people God protect them. War gain nothing just mean to lose lives and money for some industries, a business for few and disasters for many, just for the abuse of power and defense of own resources,like oil, many countries wanna their oil.
2597 2018-02-15 17:39:16 BS on gas tax. We are taxed on everything. Reduce spending for frogs that sing, cut benefits and salaries of politicians...the've done nothing for years and years, Oil companies profits at all time high, drug industry moguls hit them with tax, drop foreign aid. Get it?
2598 2018-02-15 17:39:07 obviously, same reason we can't take steps towards preventing climate change. ran by war and oil profiteers.
2599 2018-02-15 17:38:41 New Mexico has got to break the reliance on and influence of the oil & gas cartels. #nmpol
2600 2018-02-15 17:38:24 That's a tacho from a type r lol and low oil would usually illuminate the low oil pressure light and also a K20 would shit itself very very quickly with low/no oil pressure.

2604 2018-02-15 17:37:32 Assuming it's varnished, shellacked, or lacquered it will probably be fine. The people having problems seem to mainly have uncured oil finishes.
2605 2018-02-15 17:37:06 Truth is always like a drop of oil in water NO matter how much water you add it's always floats on the top.

2606 2018-02-15 17:37:03 2. The transformation now underway to electrify the economy will take about 30-40 years. New England can lead. NE should keep current nukes, accelerate renewables, DER, EE, DR, Storage all to displace as much oil and gas as quickly as possible.
2607 2018-02-15 17:36:23 stop ruining the planet with your greed and foolish ideologies. You can not eat oil or money.
2608 2018-02-15 17:36:16 Essar Oil sold out to Rosneft/Trafigura/UCP for $13bn to repay loans of banks. ADAG group sold out telecom assets for $4bn & Jaypee group sold cement plants to repay $2.5bn debt

2610 2018-02-15 17:36:10 Prepoo for 15mins with coconut oil. I deep condition after my shampoo. Then I apply my leave-in & seal with olive oil and Cantu curling cream. I let my hair air-dry in about 12 twists. #SizzelleChat

2612 2018-02-15 17:36:06 I hope someone advises @potus that a #GasTax hits working class harder.

Instead, levy an "excise" tax on big oil company excess profits to fund #InfrastructurePlan
2613 2018-02-15 17:36:03 ol extract refers to existing legal cannabis oil products (diluted extractions), not vapeable oils (yet)
2614 2018-02-15 17:35:52 Consider this:

With the "Climate Change" false narrative, we were moving away from oil to alternative energy sources. So if the oil would no longer be as valuable, what would the next hot commodity be?

By grace are ye saved. Not of your own actions.
2617 2018-02-15 17:35:23 Please why so much oil charges are incurred

All you two care about is money, greed, corporations, lowering taxes while giving the wealthy/corporations tax cuts & more money!  Of course, you take all this money from corporations & lobbyists then sell off protected lands for oil
2627 2018-02-15 17:33:19 Hmmmm the other young lady said she puts olive oil in the perm I’m intrigued
2628 2018-02-15 17:33:16 I got very very muddy playing a Wide Game while camping somewhere in Arne. Sticky Harbour mud, gelatinous with all that boat oil. We were hosed off by an irate guider. It wasn’t fun.
2629 2018-02-15 17:33:16 All this craziness reminded me to oil my counters, so I suppose it’s not all bad. Just 98.3%

2639 2018-02-15 17:31:48 Uh... noooo. That oil is destined for China. Not a drop goes to Canadian consumers. Check facts - pipelines don't help Canadian consumers one bit.
2640 2018-02-15 17:31:39 Well I was suggesting this gov do more for the sick and poor - not sure that equivalent to Venezuelan socialism which involved subsidising oil and other goods. However carry on ignoring the poor and sick - it's what you do.
2641 2018-02-15 17:31:27 It do! Lmaoooo!! The results make up for the smell...that and this coconut oil soap I been using to balance shit out...it’s been dope so far

2657 2018-02-15 17:29:27 Khulubuse Zuma has two oil fields in the DRC. We know how he got them and who the actual holder is. If Kabila"s illegitimate government falls and new administration comes in he will lose them. Now you know why the SANDF is in the DRC.
2658 2018-02-15 17:29:20 So why are we losing recreational land to the oil industry?  We should be winning this fight.

2676 2018-02-15 17:27:09 See that's the issue, people think letting someone or some company keep what is theirs is a gift. A tax break means the government takes less, the oil company is still paying. There is no budget line item that sayes pay oil company X.
2677 2018-02-15 17:26:49 3 key #Macro concerns for India in 2018
1. bond yields : India's largest budget expenditure is on interest payments
2. oil prices : a $10 rise increases budget deficit by ~$10b (India imports ~1.3 billion barrels of oil)
3. bank NPAs : Indian banks have ~$130b of NPAs

2682 2018-02-15 17:26:10 What's the point? That's how it all started.

First of all I am talking about energy crises. An energy crisis is any great shortfall (or price rise) in the supply of energy resources to an economy. It usually refers to the shortage of oil and additionally to electricity or other natural resources.

2698 2018-02-15 17:23:57 I used to like Sassafras albidum a lot too, but be warned: sassafras was banned by the US FDA for use in mass produced root beer in 1960 after lab animals given sassafras containing high levels of safrole oil, a precursor of MDA and MMDA, developed liver damage and cancer.

Went in for a oil change and get it back with a key in the AC Condenser, they refuse to fix their mistake!!
2709 2018-02-15 17:22:40 Absolutely no one is hiding. The reason you know some people who work for civil organizations and environmental groups are paid is because they are open and transparent, unlike oil companies and their paid lobbyists.

2711 2018-02-15 17:22:08 I think we will collapse in the end.  Other countries will surpass us and not be oil dependent anymore and it will lower the prices and destroy us.
2712 2018-02-15 17:22:06 Maybe china will print Yuan and try to use it to pay for the natural gas and oil it buys from the United states. I count on that happening LOL

2717 2018-02-15 17:21:53 Isn’t that oil destined to China for processing and usage? Do we have any real refineries in Canada (“upgrader” in Regina doesn’t produce gasoline or diesel does it?)? We can’t do anything with it and the oil in your vehicle.. does it come back from China or from USA/OPEC?

2726 2018-02-15 17:20:45 Disappointed to report that the vegan quesadilla at Busboys and Poets is not what it used to be. The tortilla was overfried and tasted like gone-off oil.
2727 2018-02-15 17:20:44 That would be the goal.Renewable energy is amazing-its a step in the right direction,but unfortunately, it doesn't produce enough energy for some of us colder cities that require more energy,therefore,it's not a reliable source.We'll need oil & gas until we find a better solution
2728 2018-02-15 17:20:44 I'm seriously starting to consider it

2741 2018-02-15 17:18:50 Why does it have to be "dozens" or nothing? Not building pipelines doesn't mean we are lessening our reliance on or use of nat gas. Actually, it's the opposite, plus more oil and coal in winter. My frustration is w/ the wind, solar & EE only crowd. Those alone can't get us there.

2748 2018-02-15 17:17:34 In this year 2018, the UAE will likely see an increase of 3.3% from the growth of 1.7% in 2017.  This accelerated growth is the fastest development in 3 years and it comes on the strength of rising oil prices and other austerity measures taken by the UAE.

2861 2018-02-15 17:01:26 if you supported GEJ who depleted our external reserve frm $65b down to $23b in oil boom , u should be ashamed of urself today criticizing PMB who has rebuilt that reserve back to it current level of $42.8b .go look in the mirror ,u are everything wrong with Nigeria @adeyanjudeji
2862 2018-02-15 17:01:19 Are they renegotiating private or public debt?  As oil production continues collapsing this story will get uglier.  I would imagine the military is growing ever uneasy.
2863 2018-02-15 17:01:18 Betonite clay, water, ACV & a few drops of tea tree oil. Bomb ass face mask when you're breaking out.
2864 2018-02-15 17:01:18 You right no way I could make that mistake Simmi you have much better hair than Riaad... I'm guessing Amla oil twice a week
2865 2018-02-15 17:01:16 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.
--Mother Teresa
Our spiritual nature must be nurtured. Prayer and meditation lovingly kindle the flame that guides us from within.

2867 2018-02-15 17:01:15 @FairQuestions (for instance) has been offering the #media detailed evidence of #US backed #FN and #NGO anti-#Canadian oil campaigns for years...but we're constantly told by #media it's all "grass roots" activity to save the planet..
2868 2018-02-15 17:01:09 Dear india, Oil your own machine. Don't looked be smart.
2869 2018-02-15 17:01:05 I used that combo you did. 
Shea Moisture JBCO and black soap with drops of tea tree oil and rosemary oil (I don't have peppermint oil here in Ibadan)
It worked wonders!!!

2871 2018-02-15 17:00:59 Making a deal on how best Erdogan can slaughter Syrian Kurds, how much of vthe oil US gets control of, who controls which parts of ISIS. So on.
2872 2018-02-15 17:00:52 I can't believe she thinks that she's neutral on issues. I don't get it
2873 2018-02-15 17:00:43 OIL DIFF: 3.41 -> 3.44
2874 2018-02-15 17:00:33 OPEC + Russia would control 45% of world oil supply. #OOTT

2877 2018-02-15 17:00:16 Electricity is not the only use for gas, especially in New England. Aren't you interested in getting more customers off oil?
2878 2018-02-15 17:00:11 damn im so tired i forgot to put oil on the pan b4hand while cooking breakfast smh
2879 2018-02-15 17:00:09 You probably remember your oil changes, but don't forget about your filters! Dirty filters can increase your fuel usage by as much as 10%.
2880 2018-02-15 17:00:07 I'm big into oil. I own lots of it and I know what it smells like. It's rich smelling. The smell itself spawns property and mansions.
2881 2018-02-15 16:59:49 We spend billions in oil and coal subsidies while capitalism (righteously) wipes those industries out but the millions we spend on starving people is the real waste?
2882 2018-02-15 16:59:47 How do you confront a housemate who steals your food, first avocado, now cooking oil, eggs and peanut butter (ge a fetja go utswa ga a e tswaleli nex) yet she always has six pack ya Guerana??

2884 2018-02-15 16:59:24 "The Lord has anointed me... to comfort all who mourn; to provide for those who mourn in Zion—to give them a garland instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit." Isaiah 61:2-3
2885 2018-02-15 16:59:11 The $13.5 billion firearm industry is a prime example of big business putting profits, shareholder interest & the bottom line ahead of public safety. Don't for one second think it's relegated to that industry. Big pharma. Big oil. Wall Street. Take your pick. #stonemanshooting
2886 2018-02-15 16:59:02 No dirty oil in BC
2887 2018-02-15 16:58:56 If only there was a profession that focused on researching facts and reporting them to the public.
2888 2018-02-15 16:58:53 seriously we were hearing this morning that NRA can prevent bills to be taken to floor of our government-can not even discuss? Would we give that much power to an oil company? google? Facebook? pharmaceuticals? but gun companies have that power?
2889 2018-02-15 16:58:52 Totally forgot I put coconut oil in my hair before bed

2892 2018-02-15 16:58:44 Although it's still flowing, we're basically in a post oil economy.
2893 2018-02-15 16:58:39 Y'all, I just cleaned a nasty wood table with canola oil and vinegar.  Crazy effective. #nontoxic #greenclean
2894 2018-02-15 16:58:05 This was Libya under Gaddafi: A portion of Libyan oil sales was credited directly to the bank accounts of all Libyan citizens.

2897 2018-02-15 16:57:43 literally "add oil", like convering the sense of redoubling your effort - so you'll hear people shouting it at sporting events, as well as using it in a more personal way.
2898 2018-02-15 16:57:42 I hate taking my car in for a simple oil change and the mechanics try to push 30 different problems and diagnostics and shit to get me to end up paying $2k or some ridiculous amount. It happens every time I take my car in. -.-
2899 2018-02-15 16:57:13 WTI oil at $60.44/barrel, +$0.16.
2900 2018-02-15 16:57:08 You haven't heard of Standard Oil then.
2901 2018-02-15 16:57:05 Louise Yamada and @TomKloza join @CNBCFuturesNow at 1pm --Louise called the bond move --and Tom called the recent dump in oil --see where they stand now #oott #emini #bonds

2903 2018-02-15 16:57:02 They went after Rockefeller to break up Standard Oil now they’re after Bezos and Amazon
2904 2018-02-15 16:56:54 Only until oil drops again then the province is going to be screwed

2907 2018-02-15 16:56:21 パズチャレで今回のランダン練習出来るとか思ってたんだけど
そもそも、ランダンとパズチャレの仕様が別物だった。
2908 2018-02-15 16:56:12 No, because the squeakiest wheel gets the oil. If they don't tow the line, there will be hell to pay. And people sit by and let it go because they don't understand the ramifications of adopting SJW thinking.
2909 2018-02-15 16:56:11 GDP isn't supposed to say anything about income distribution.  That's another conversation but you can better understand the economy in NL by breaking down the direct oil and minerals (non-renewables) revenue from the rest.
2910 2018-02-15 16:56:10 REMEMBER HILLARY SAYING ON TV TRY BEING NICER TO THE MUSLIMS SHE LIKED THAT OIL MONEY COMING IN--SEND THEM TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO WELL TRY AND LIVE LIKE AN AMERICAN--YOU KNOW OUR WHITE PRIVILEGE

2913 2018-02-15 16:55:51 Trump is mentally disturbed, in my humble opinion. This is NOT a reality show! He should act like a president, not a snake oil salesman.
2914 2018-02-15 16:55:45 @PMOIndia Bank  scams exist in many sectors, particularly which have substantial working capital  requirement and least profits , viz. edible oil , cotton , soybean, rice etc. Order forensic audit of failed a/cs in these sectors.

2921 2018-02-15 16:54:30 The greenback is under pressure against its European rivals, but higher against commodity-related ones, as crude oil prices retreated almost $2.00 from yesterday's highs, while Wall Street barely remains afloat after a strong start to the day.
2922 2018-02-15 16:54:13 わたし？【獣】握ってました
2923 2018-02-15 16:54:07 How about instead of cuts we bring in more revune? We do not tax oil that flows thru our state like other states (MO, KS, TX). We have lots of tax loopholes that could be closed, like the TIF nonsense that is out of control.

2930 2018-02-15 16:53:18 You're right, but that's not really my point. I'm just saying that the automobile industry is a good example of where increased regulation of both producers and consumers had a really positive effect.
2931 2018-02-15 16:53:07 @YankeeHomestead 
Hello,  I read your webpage explaining how to remove the sticky residue on bottles.  My wife would like to know, Do you know how to remove the smell in a bottle so it can be used on a different oil
Thanks,  Michael
2932 2018-02-15 16:53:03 if you need a new oil pan you might as well do the oil pump too, and check all the bearings, and....
2933 2018-02-15 16:52:55 Ugh no the snails!!!! (I tried to say I’d go back to vegetarianism this year but I’ve completely failed.) I hear you about the oils—coconut oil on my face is the one that brings me instantly to acne. On my body & hair it’s fine, on my face, it’s crazg!

2941 2018-02-15 16:52:13 The same people praising Lissa Lucas for testifying against the oil and gas companies are the ones who do nothing to help the environment. Modern day “do gooders”. Criticising the oil companies whilst driving everywhere
2942 2018-02-15 16:51:58 My heart is heavy that your husband is owned by the NRA and oil companies
2943 2018-02-15 16:51:50 I don't know if it's on your registry, but I'm having an oil derrick named in honor of this beautiful coupling.
2944 2018-02-15 16:51:49 Yeah, you're right. The Peugeot 406 was one of the finest riding motors ever.
Just why Peugeot stopped manufacturing its own dampers is one of the great unanswered questions of all time. As for the Scimitar. You'll just have to hope the oil pump doesn't go West.

2955 2018-02-15 16:50:13 When did we start lowering speed limits? Limits have been rising since the end of the 1970s oil crisis.  Yes cracking down on DWI is a great step, but then does legalizing marijuana make sense?  All I ask is to get the facts straight.  Agree guns/autos poor analogy.
2956 2018-02-15 16:50:13 Rachel is bitter b/c she said if AB pays carbon taxes the p/l will b built. Lashing out because her plan isn’t working. THE IDEA IS THE SYSTEM WON’T SPILL ANY OIL!

2958 2018-02-15 16:49:58 Vaping oil is huge.
2959 2018-02-15 16:49:48 Try shampoo with no conditioner. Your shampoo has lots of conditioning elements like coconut oil and triglycerides.
2960 2018-02-15 16:49:48 America the beautiful...not.
America who sacrifice her kids to gun industry profits/mass shootings.
America who sacrifice her youth to oil industry profits/foreign Wars. 
America who sacrifice her sick to medical industry profits. 
Maybe the rivers & the mountains are beautiful.

2962 2018-02-15 16:49:40 Currently, the FG policies encourage exporting jobs rather than creating ones. Our export has increased to 69% last quarter most of which were raw materials, (Oil, Minerals, Agric produce etc). This help sending them to countries to be processed rather than here #MeetAdamuGarba

2965 2018-02-15 16:49:09 And how much of our energy needs are supplied by everything NOT including the big 3 of oil, coal and natural gas? I am all for and prefer your alternative energy sources but until your 22nd century energy sources can can replace oil Kw for Kw you’re gonna need the oil.

2975 2018-02-15 16:47:18 the strategy was to allow ISIS to become a wedge in syria against iran ,until russia and iran /hezbollah started destroying them ,when the US swapped then with kurds now controlling oil fields,ISIS said to have been moved to afghanistan

2977 2018-02-15 16:47:06 Efficiency is important for your furnace because you pay for oil. It is irrelevant in Solar because sunshine is free. The only relevant question is ‘What’s the payback period?” My solar paid off in 7.5 yrs, average $/kWh = $0.065/kWh.

2983 2018-02-15 16:46:41 The challenge now is to find ways to gracefully withdraw. The "Oil Deep State" will resist until the bubble bursts. Then it will abandon it's liabilities just like Enron.
2984 2018-02-15 16:46:29 @RSPOtweets I'm creating a poster on sustainable palm oil for my course and was wondering whether I could to use the RSPO logo to show consumers what it would look like to buy a certified sustainable product that is labelled? Thanks!

2992 2018-02-15 16:44:41 What viable alternatives are there that could meet mass-demand? If companies in Europe + US taking accountability for their supply chains and switch to 100% certified sustainable palm oil, we can set a good example for India and China (largest importers) to follow suit.

ARAB OIL INDUSTRY WILL COME TO A STANDSTILL AND BILLIONS OF PEOPLE WILL USE BICYCLE TO GO TO WORK.

PRICE OF BICYCLE WILL SHOOT UP TO US$ 100 OR MORE?

HOW ABOUT 12 BILLION BICYCLES?

3007 2018-02-15 16:42:44 Yeah I’m terrified of skin whitening stuff. The K product that works best for me is the simple moisturizing snail mask stuff. I avoid anything complicated mostly because I had bad acne most my life & it finally went away. The hyped expensive product I love most is Rodin face oil!
3008 2018-02-15 16:42:09 Yes it is extremely easy to become qualified with oil. Some one could be a lollypop man one day (no disrepct for road crossing personel), decide to be an oil engineer, and be qualified in 5 days. That is not competence.
3009 2018-02-15 16:42:06 With adequate Capital, our Palm Oil production will be increased, thereby also creating additional employment opportunities.

3010 2018-02-15 16:41:46 Funds, Funds and More Funds. My goal is to expand the Palm Oil production but I am limited by funds. I started the business with my personal savings and I have kept ploughing back my profits.

3011 2018-02-15 16:41:42 
So let me get this clearly.. you want Saudi Arabia to ship oil to your countries for "FREE" just because we have alot of it!
So regardless of the names,Rohingyas,Burmans,Saudi Arabia has been hosting the largestr number of them worlwide and since almost a hundred year!!!
3012 2018-02-15 16:41:38 So global free trade agreements won't help the whiskey trade and oil?

3021 2018-02-15 16:40:32 I wanna believe that the main contributor to our foreign reserve is largely due to rise in crude oil price as witness from 2016 to date. 
If you take away crude oil, we would absolute be next to nothing today. We all still have our memory intact on the events of 2015 to 2016/17
3022 2018-02-15 16:40:14 I presume they follow the conventional arguments, also accepted in part by ILO. Interestingly @kaushikcbasu has long disagreed, with rigour.
3023 2018-02-15 16:40:12 Says the hypocrite that uses oil and the products it produces everyday.
3024 2018-02-15 16:40:10 Help them to rebuild their infrastructure so they can produce more oil, all the while destroying Canada’s oil & gas industry so we can import more foreign oil. Makes sense.

3032 2018-02-15 16:38:51 I dream of one day getting off from work having a man cook for me, bathe me then oil me down 
3033 2018-02-15 16:38:47 It didn't end there.Nagarwala,who was supposed to be the culprit and was jailed and killed,was treated by a Doctor.This Doctor was also killed in an accident.This remained an unsolved mystery till date.Kuo oil deal under Indira was another unsolved mystery.
3034 2018-02-15 16:38:41 Now is definitely the time to buy, 3 wells opening up, oil in play only needs to be 150bopd. Balschome and brockham Kim is the mega bucks boom #ANGS

3037 2018-02-15 16:38:12 The oil industry doesn't pretend it's support is from grassroots activism.
3038 2018-02-15 16:38:08 Republicans do nothing on this issue because the are owned by the @NRA . Why do you people vote for them, here are the consequences. Rampant gun violence, environmental regulations gone, drilling oil rather than green technology which is the future.
3039 2018-02-15 16:38:07 Well you can, but it would be foolish. Salmond lied to you. He used the figure for unproved reserves. This oil is incredibly expensive to extract and needs huge economies of scale. You can't do it without private enterprise. It's not like SA where you just brush the sand away.

3041 2018-02-15 16:37:31 Online diesel forums are hilarious. Since when has oil been compressible and diesel fuel not. Makes no sense 
3042 2018-02-15 16:37:27 No, treat cars like guns. Clean them, oil them, lock them in a safe place, and dont use them to mow down people because you're an asshole.
3043 2018-02-15 16:37:24 What's the chemistry of this speaker base silicone ring issue? Is the oil somehow getting picked up by the silicone? Is it being mechanically displaced by vibrations? It's a weird problem.
3044 2018-02-15 16:37:23 Hi Carl, nope I still disagree. My grandfather helped in their set up and was their first inspector. Anyone is able to complete training for oil in 4-5 days with no prior experience in anything related to boilers or heating.

3047 2018-02-15 16:37:14 It's the US oil interests that have been fighting so hard to landlock our oil. By getting our product to the world market we can get market price which helps all CDN's.

3049 2018-02-15 16:36:42 How much does it cost in time? Is the water for washing and cooking the rice safe or did you have to buy filters on top of it? Do you have the spices to make it edible? The oil for fat?

3053 2018-02-15 16:36:15 I concur. I know personally of guys who have had 0 gas experience who got qualified, registered GSR, couldn't carry out a tightness test yet did 1 week training on oil and were qualified to work on it. 
I mean how does that work??
3054 2018-02-15 16:36:14 What I have done this past week is morning and night 1/2 tablespoon each apple cider vinegar, elderberry juice and maple syrup. Vitamin C capsules and thieves Essential oil. So far I am clear. And diffusing oils constantly.

3057 2018-02-15 16:35:59 Paid protesters? What exactly is wrong with that? Doesn't the oil industry use paid lawyers, PR firms, and spokespeople to make their case? Why one set of rules for the oil industry and another for citizens groups? Please explain.
3058 2018-02-15 16:35:55 Any way, oil is on its way out and Scotland has huge potential for wind energy...
3059 2018-02-15 16:35:45 Its not just oil, over £1billion in whiskey, its 1/5th of UK exports, then there is Salmon 50% of heathrow exports, oh and Gin i think thats a billion too, oh yes all that lovely tax doesn't earn Scotland and interest, it all goes to UKtreasury, Scotland get ur act together

3064 2018-02-15 16:35:15 You have to ask yourself why Montana and Washington State aren’t anxious to have the pipeline if it’s so wonderful. Keep your dirty oil. We want to protect the environment here in BC. What is wrong with that?

3121 2018-02-15 16:28:56 Inflation as reported can't soar. But, using 1980 CPI calc method, inflation now running at 10%. 1990 CPI method, inflation running at 6%. In 1999, copper was $0.60 /lb and oil was $12/bbl. Both are up 5x. Hedonics, substitution, geometric weighting ensure low reported inflation.

3131 2018-02-15 16:28:00 Energy East makes more sense than ever.  Too bad there are no companies who want to invest in Canadian energy and then have to deal with the Liberal mushy delays. People - we are importing foreign oil @30% , more than we export to the US - and the US  are needing it less & less.

3134 2018-02-15 16:27:50 Well, healthcare is one policy, the article cites many others (oil production, banks, education). The article explicitly calls for less inequality, which to Dr. Peterson's point, the policies that are enacted in those efforts often do not end up well.

McDavid and Maroon aren't anywhere near the same value in terms of contract $ after this season, so you're left with an ELC, a depth guy and Klefbom.

3304 2018-02-15 16:11:23 Huh. Alberta implemented a Carbon Tax that is now paid by Albertans. Followed the law.  Consider when Alberta sells oil and pays carbon tax you have tax dollars to develop alternative energy in Canada rather than pay for another country's tech transition.

3358 2018-02-15 16:06:32 (1) CCS tax credits needn’t involve EOR at all. If the need is political – if a major concession to the oil industry that might significantly expand production & increase emissions at other taxpayers’ expense is a pre-req to getting it passed – maybe proponents should reconsider.

3367 2018-02-15 16:05:44 I've never found evidence that palm oil is bad for health. It is high in saturated fats, but as we know, that's not a problem. It is used heavily in processed foods, however, and those foods contain sugar, grains, etc...so those foods are unhealthy for other reasons.

3414 2018-02-15 15:58:52 Wagners contract was for the oil fields and they do not awnser to the MoD. Just like Academi. Not to difficult to comprehend?
3415 2018-02-15 15:58:40 I don't agree with this. Tax the billions of profit the oil companies rake in each quarter
3416 2018-02-15 15:58:40 Last night my dad ate sardines (gross) and threw the juice/oil/whatever it is in the yard. I get home and my dog is eating the all the grass in one spot in our yard...next thing I know it’s 3am and I wake up to Luna puking on my bed...thanks Dad.

3513 2018-02-15 15:45:20 I believe using captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) presents a useful near-term market niche to improve economics of early capture projects, help scale-up tech & associated pipeline infrastructure. This is valuable even if net CO2 impact is small or even negative.
3514 2018-02-15 15:45:13 5.774 to 6.226...thats the 2017 average for US oil exports to the 2018 average to date.  That my friends is the sound of America growing into a major oil supplier #GrowBabyGrow

But the a pipeline of dilbit isn’t the same as nat gas or oil if it spills. We need more understanding of impacts before allowing it. And cover for cleanup.
3552 2018-02-15 15:40:47 I just love going to get an oil change and end up having to pay for the oil change AND a new battery 
3553 2018-02-15 15:40:47 getting my oil changed by the mall so I figured I’d go in and catch up on some notes. This would be hella easier if I actually HAD my notebook 
3554 2018-02-15 15:40:36 neither of those stocks has high short interest. In fact short interest across sector is no where where it was when these were getting destroyed. Somebody is sure as shit selling all of these names tho

3558 2018-02-15 15:40:08 サラダ油は野菜って言ったら変な顔されたよ。サラダってついてるのに本当に馬鹿だなあ。
3559 2018-02-15 15:40:03 Bless, probably supported Chelsea before the oil money arrived

3565 2018-02-15 15:39:18 Who else is supposed to fight the wars for oil profit?
3566 2018-02-15 15:38:57 We're like oil and water
3567 2018-02-15 15:38:53 明日白魔邸破壊するので暇人は連絡ください
3568 2018-02-15 15:38:30 You can, I also thought. Different type of silicone? But our Apple device ppl told me that they’ve seen this with the silicone feet of other devices too. The oil thing sounds plausible to me too, but it also sounds hand wavey. Like Apple doesn’t know what’s going on either.

3571 2018-02-15 15:38:27 the hatred for the sector is unbelievable
3572 2018-02-15 15:38:23 update: it’s oil paint and it’s all over my favorite jacket :)
3573 2018-02-15 15:38:21 is maracuja oil better or just plain vitam c oil for acne prone skin

3576 2018-02-15 15:38:06 I know there's still oil production in Alaska, but does anyone really care anymore?  I would think that James Evans does....#GoodTimes #DYNOMITE!
3577 2018-02-15 15:37:56 Getting my Oil Change, Tires Rotated, and an alignment.... they're getting all the ones from my dashboard lol. 
3578 2018-02-15 15:37:51 Bit gutting we're going to be up against a top side in city over the next few yrs.  Without that oil money we would be bagging a good few trophies over the next 4/5 seasons . Still fancy us to grab 3/4 though
3579 2018-02-15 15:37:40 mana lagi better, hada labo cleansing oil or simple cleansing oil?
3580 2018-02-15 15:37:39 นุชชช เราขอแบ่งสักก้านได้มั้ยคะ
3581 2018-02-15 15:37:26 Exactly, tax the working class while oil companies profit.
3582 2018-02-15 15:37:00 Jadys aunt made her bath scrubs, and didn’t have coconut oil so she used vegetable oil
3583 2018-02-15 15:36:52 I brought my car in for an oil change and i didn’t clean out the inside and I’m actually embarrassed rn 
3584 2018-02-15 15:36:45 She’s running warm making oil and and burning oil but she runs like a champ
3585 2018-02-15 15:36:42 NEVER forget that our Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, still has a $500 Billion oil deal pending in Russia. Unfulfilled bc of sanctions!
3586 2018-02-15 15:36:40 Remoaner Jock Ruth wants to give English money to foriegners.  We voted leave and that means we spend money on our own people.  Your boss Teresa is behind Brexit and wants to focus on the UK; time you jocks got on board or give us back our oil and left the union
3587 2018-02-15 15:36:36 Unless you live in a self sustaining home and don't use any form of oil or gas to support your lifestyle, you are contributing to the demand of these products. Majority of us in Canada depend on it. Not saying I'm pro pipelines, but I'm not against it either. #justsaying
3588 2018-02-15 15:36:32 Good Luck!
3589 2018-02-15 15:36:01 Tip of the day, don't put Olbas oil in ya ear thinking it's Otex!!! 
3590 2018-02-15 15:36:01 Bottle them up. It works for me.
3591 2018-02-15 15:35:49 Both Encana & Marathon Oil beat Q4 expectations, Encana announces $400M shares buyback program, market rewards it with $mro -4.5% $eca -1.96% ; this sector continues to be dominated by short-sellers. #oott #oil
3592 2018-02-15 15:35:49 Ps 133:2: It is like precious oil poured on the head, running down on the beard, running down on Aaron’s beard, down upon the collar of his robes.
3593 2018-02-15 15:35:42 Won’t stop the oil mate ;-)
3594 2018-02-15 15:35:36 Wow, Paul, speaking to a big tobacco, big corporation, big oil lobbyist group! Look at your care for the “hick” show itself as the sham it is. Way to sell out!!
3595 2018-02-15 15:35:26 Also @SenCoryGardner wife Jaime has worked for the Govt in Alaska pushing big oil interests and then went to private sector which she then parlayed into oil gas money for @SenCoryGardner campaign. Oil still is his biggest donor after NRA

3602 2018-02-15 15:34:50 Why can't we have sensible gun control? = NRA $
Why can't we have single payer health care? = Insurance $
Why can't we have reasonable drug prices = Big Pharma $
Why can't we have more green energy? = Big Oil $
Why can't we cut the obscene military budget? = Defense Related $
3603 2018-02-15 15:34:48 As I get older, I notice my body is increasing its oil and gas production. 
3604 2018-02-15 15:34:48 Papalitan ko na naman castor oil ko!! 
3605 2018-02-15 15:34:26 May you have a safe and successful race meeting Harli & team.

3614 2018-02-15 15:33:38 I am taller than KAI... I guess that peaches helps you grow better than curry and chili oil...

3621 2018-02-15 15:32:36 I oil my wood every morning.
3622 2018-02-15 15:32:32 #Solarpanels in roads  so, it's happening throughout the world already. Solarpanels in roads put America back to work. Less oil, for the US used. Tax relief to for cars purchased

3624 2018-02-15 15:32:19 my face is so soft with this oil.
3625 2018-02-15 15:32:12 Oil oil oil
3626 2018-02-15 15:32:08 I've said it before: Unless you live in Falujah or Yemen or something, there's no justification to own an AR. Handguns  should be well regulated to get, but war rifles should be near impossible. The same way you need a different licence to drive a car and an oil truck.
3627 2018-02-15 15:32:05 The Oil must be a good team this year than. Oh wait. Not!

3630 2018-02-15 15:31:55 @770KTTH Those male enhancement products you advertise are snake oil.  You should listen to Dr. Mixon on your station.  He talks about what a hoax they are. They also have harmful side effects.  Shame on you for peddling this junk.
3631 2018-02-15 15:31:54 so glad he’s buying me a new charger cause god knows I didn’t wanna spend that 30$ & I need my oil changed 
3632 2018-02-15 15:31:54 Alaskans own 800 shares of HNZ GROUP INC, worth $7,990. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.
3633 2018-02-15 15:31:44 we’ve got the temps in the 60’s in mid-february in KY through PA & that makes frozen water area become death traps if it keeps going this way. but gotta love the break from the extreme of cold we had...wicked heat’n oil and electric bills ....
3634 2018-02-15 15:31:33 Oregano oil, gargle with salt water, zinc throat lozenges... I hope you feel better!
3635 2018-02-15 15:31:32 Who knew the most delightful part of my day would be getting my oil changed
3636 2018-02-15 15:31:18 It was a pomade comprised of squirrel oil, tobacco paste, and a tea tree.
3637 2018-02-15 15:31:13 Alberta Justice lawyer tells Supreme Court that oil wells need to be regulated from cradle to grave. Properly abandoning a well and reclaiming it is necessary. #Redwater

3641 2018-02-15 15:31:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, yet is now at large.

3651 2018-02-15 15:29:21 @late2game Tried 2 estimate my last car's annual & monthly cost. Added total cost, 8 tires, 4 rims, 4 wheel covers, tire & oil changes, regular maintenance, emergency repairs, fuel & more. Depreciation was car cost minus trade-in value. Est. annual cost $4540 or $378 monthly.
3652 2018-02-15 15:28:55 Tell the Alberta gov’t to suck it. You want us to assume all the risk for your quick oil industry buck? 

Is that why you’re targeting BCers over 25 and not living in the affected northern areas with your cynical ad campaign?

Oil companies own your gov’t, not ours. Get bent.
3653 2018-02-15 15:28:49 Oh no shea butter is my life saver. Idk again oh lool. But the castor oil acts as a conditioner. If your hair is dirty you can use the castor oil first and then cowash/wash & condition after
3654 2018-02-15 15:28:46 @PPouyanne great work update man,please look to total oil producing in nigeria development and please employ nwachuku noble for me is active and strong thank you,by world president @pwerri_cute
3655 2018-02-15 15:28:42 Lol bruh. They ran two planes into the trade center on purpose just to have a reason to go get oil. You think they care about our families and kids. It's sad. Its fucked up. But they don't care.

3664 2018-02-15 15:27:46 Mine was a 99 freightliner classic. Was worth 7000 at best a year ago sold for 22000 last week. Also had a fuel in oil that buyers knew about.
3665 2018-02-15 15:27:41 she only uses coconut oil as a lotion and said “she only puts on her skin what she can eat” 

we are the same. im in love
3666 2018-02-15 15:27:41 Oil is no longer future?
3667 2018-02-15 15:27:34 Why don’t you. You should really read up on the oil sands cause you have no understanding about them. The reclamation work done there is the best in the world
3668 2018-02-15 15:27:31 Its only a curse to nationalists who try to pretend it is something it isnt. The rest of us welcome the addition of oil income to the UKs overall economy. Unfortunately with low oil prices it doesnt add much now but thats the swings and rouiundabouts of the global economy.
3669 2018-02-15 15:27:09 今日Chili oilさんにアッパーされたのが一番衝撃だった(物理的に)
3670 2018-02-15 15:27:03 “BUT WHATABOUT ALL MY EMOTIONS???”
3671 2018-02-15 15:26:59 Novel approach, all political candidates refuse donations from gun manufacturers, big Pharma, big Oil, or refuse to vote for candidates that take money from. Come on America, we can do this. How about capping all funds to candidates, local less, national, more.
3672 2018-02-15 15:26:55 In addition to that, be there.  As often as possible, go.  Getting and keeping an eyeball on the school, staff and students is critical.   From K thru 12, be there, look and listen.  Astute observation from caring parents is key.
3673 2018-02-15 15:26:51 So I omitted coffee,baking powder.  Reduced the sugar, buttermilk by 1/2 cup. Flour 2 1/2 cups. Olive oil 1 1/2 cup. 2 eggs. 1 tsp salt,1 tsp baking soda +1 tsp white vinegar.  4 tsp cocoa , 2 tsp vanilla & 1oz food color.

3675 2018-02-15 15:26:45 And the LORD said, "Arise, anoint him, for this is he." Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the LORD rushed upon David from that day forward. And Samuel rose up and went to Ramah. --- 1 Samuel 16:12b-13
3676 2018-02-15 15:26:44 I still struggle with Russian motivation for creating chaos in the western world. I don’t doubt they are doing it but chaos leads to economic problems which will depress oil usage and prices which will further cripple the Russian economy. It’s maddeningly self destructive.

3680 2018-02-15 15:25:35 jeg siger lige nej tak her.. men jeg kan på det kraftigste anbefale tee-tree oil til bumser. Og at man bruger det efter man har isat kontaktlinser, ikke før. Aldrig før.

3682 2018-02-15 15:25:26 Watched #ThePost the other day. Decades of sacrificing US soldiers in the interests of power and money, now ANOTHER mass shooting in the US sacrificing kids, and they still want to tear down healthcare reform.  

The US doesn't burn oil to prosper.  It burns its own people.

3685 2018-02-15 15:25:13 Seeing my "troublemaker" tends to be more active than usual, we've added an afternoon half-dose of CBD oil to my daily doses. Ever since, troublemaker hasn't caused much trouble
3686 2018-02-15 15:25:05 This company has never, in its history, actually found oil that is usable....ever. The only money they've ever made is from investors buying their warrants....
3687 2018-02-15 15:25:00 Has anyone made a marinade from a bbq rub before? Surely adding a bit of oil and Apple cider vinegar would work 
3688 2018-02-15 15:24:45 I’m fairly chomping through the electrons today. Working at home. Central heating bust. Two 2kW oil filler radiators and a 1.8kW fan heater going. I can almost hear the wheel in the electric meter spinning. But at lease it’s rotation will add more heat ;)

3690 2018-02-15 15:24:42 The thing is, these “big bad” oil companies never actually press charges and they should.
3691 2018-02-15 15:24:37 add vitamin E oil in with any moisturizer! All you need is like a drop and it’s cheap af at Walmart
3692 2018-02-15 15:24:35 Gotta stick a little coconut oil up there to unlock moisture like you've never had before.
3693 2018-02-15 15:24:07 This country is becoming one huge mining pig and oil drilling zone with the best military to protect it. These entitlement programs are in the way.
3694 2018-02-15 15:24:03 Yep - Russia doesn't have the money or oil of China and Saudi Arabia but democrats & Rinos put up that red herring and accept bags of cash from the real enemies

3700 2018-02-15 15:23:20 Only people complicit to this are the bought and paid for GOP by the NRA, a domestic terrorist organization who only cares about gun sales, not safety. Clearly, the blood on their hands from dead children learning their abc’s isn’t part of their pro-life argument.

3703 2018-02-15 15:23:11 Why won’t GOP talk about this? 18 school shootings this year, on top of Vegas w/500+ injuries & 50+ deaths, and the 90/day that die. Guns are 3rd ldg cause of death in children. More Amer have died by guns than all wars combined dating back to revolutionary war.
3704 2018-02-15 15:23:10 Maybe. Better yet is to make an argument with dollar signs in it, as then we've earned the attention of not just that particular vendor, but ALL of them. Shift the demand, the vendors will happily follow. Notice there's not much of a market for actual "oil of snake" anymore?
3705 2018-02-15 15:23:08 AER tells Supreme Court that an oil company agrees to abandonment rules when it gets a licence to drill. If the company fails, the bankruptcy trustee has to follow those same rules and pay for cleanup of wells that can't be sold.

3709 2018-02-15 15:22:50 The audit for the company's southern licences in the Bahamas indicated a stock tank oil-initially-in-place of 8.3 billion barrels, with an upside of up to 28 billion barrels. The probability of success for the company's major reservoirs was between 25% and 35%!! #BPC

3729 2018-02-15 15:19:48 THE OIL COMPANIES HAVE STUDIED THIS SO THAT THEY HAVE THE BEST RESPONCE IN THE WORLD !

3732 2018-02-15 15:19:24 Cheaper and more available. Oil is only rarely run in NE. A pipeline would not just displace that residual oil, it will end the rest of the nukes in NE. More gas is not needed for renewable flexibility in this case; its primarily a winter peaking issue

3744 2018-02-15 15:17:11 MAKEUP TIP: Blot your face before adding powder to cover your oil when it starts peaking through through-out the day — helps it look less cakey.
3745 2018-02-15 15:16:58 Not really. There has been a loss of coal, oil, and nuclear generation. Natural gas displaced all except for peak periods, when residual oil and lng are needed for about ~30 days a year. Unless pipeline only operates during those days, it'll lead to more gas, end remaining nukes

3774 2018-02-15 15:13:25 Is the increase in energy demand because the pipeline gas is cheaper? It should wipe out oil which is much higher GHG which is a good thing and should provide flex back up to renewables, also good.
3775 2018-02-15 15:13:20 Hey, how about creating some jobs in renewable energy, and getting over the addiction to massive oil projects?  Then maybe my community doesn’t have those high incidence of rare cancers?  #STFO

3838 2018-02-15 15:06:30 Not at all. Venezuela has a far different make up than the UK including large foreign denominated debt and a currency peg. As their economy is largely reliant on oil and hydroelectricity it was also very susceptible to supply side shocks.
3839 2018-02-15 15:06:29 We hear ya on this and, rest assured, our tech squad's burning the midnight oil to get biz accounts switched over to the Capital One app. Your voice is heard here. ^AJS
3840 2018-02-15 15:06:24 @donlemon No Don - Their loved ones would NOT be here. The problem is NOT the gun, it is the individual behind the gun.  The heart lacking a soul.  It's the person who chooses to use it for evil vs good. Whether it's a gun or bus full of fertilizer and oil - Evil will find a way.
3841 2018-02-15 15:06:17 The oil it’s cooked in is probably what they are talking about or the butter
3842 2018-02-15 15:06:12 Honestly I’m an Albertan getting tired of this narrative. We need to refine the product here plain and simple. These major oil companies need to get on board with this or the provincial government needs to create a made in Alberta solution!
3843 2018-02-15 15:06:07 Americans don't get this, chip shop chips vary its not just "oh gosh golly British chips" some can be greasy, some can be crunchy, some can have the taste of fish because of them using the same oil. and then if they are greasy you feel awful after. You never really get good chips

3862 2018-02-15 15:04:38 That seems to be a very specific application. Wonder why oil & gas hasn’t paid for it :-)
3863 2018-02-15 15:04:38 Neither, it's a description of your statement: "emissions-wise, pipelines are lower impact than either oil or LNG". That's only true if you hold energy demand constant. The pipeline are not being built to only displace LNG/oil and will likely increase overall energy demand
3864 2018-02-15 15:04:30 Some stores were using beef-derived cooking oil. The new CEO James O'Reilly recognizes that Lent is their busiest season so he's trying to reboot the franchise by appealing (pandering?) to Catholics.

3893 2018-02-15 14:59:53 Lovely bit of work - They look great! It does need to be hot but check by dropping a little mixture in if it sinks and rises straight away it's ready. Also you may need the oil to heat up inbetween batches. Enjoy!

3916 2018-02-15 14:57:44 THe best metaphor for current gun/anti gun culture is this;
Gun legislation, as a whole, is like an engine with a slow oil leak. Adding more laws is like adding more oil to this engine; it doesn't solve the problem, it just helps the engine sputter along a little longer.
3917 2018-02-15 14:57:44 Wtf are u talking about? East coast? Must get to the coast?? The oil pipeline is to go to China. There was supposed to be one up north too that got turned down.

3956 2018-02-15 14:51:58 Oil prices up, all associated product prices increased. So Fed raises rates to curb= market crashes, drop in consumer confidence, recession.  USA should subsidize our oil & drive prices down= OPEC fail & win for USA economy

3958 2018-02-15 14:51:51 In hindsight the way Congress biggies walked away from LS2019 knowing they will lose, it does appear they wilfully tanked the economy.

3984 2018-02-15 14:48:41 Also if you look at the ingredients on most lash/brow serums 8 out of 10 it'll have castor oil in it. So you're basically paying a ton of money for a small vial of castor oil with pretty packaging...

3988 2018-02-15 14:47:56 You're right, it's semantics. It makes a big difference whether US tight oil is a marginal producer or a swing producer though. There's a reason we have two different words for it.
3989 2018-02-15 14:47:52 This wild growth oil definitely has made my hair so thick I have a hassle doing it. I guess That’s good tho it’s getting back healthy
3990 2018-02-15 14:47:48 Assocham should also undertake  a study on how this would impact the industries who are currently involved with fossil fuels. Perhaps as energy source changes for the automobiles it would have impact on industries dependent on oil & gas.
3991 2018-02-15 14:47:46 Bergen: Your top advisor says that oil should stay in the ground. Now you've said that the TMX approval was a bargaining chip.

Trudeau: He also called people making fun of me nazis, I don't see your point. We say lots of dumb things on this side of the House.

It looks as though the oil may have separated a little, causing this leak. Was this kept in a cool/dry place? Was it lying down on your duvet? Is the product inside okay? If in date, this should be just fine - Amberlee

4072 2018-02-15 14:39:25 WE COULD be doing same thing n USA, but 1) there isn't enough political pressure 2) there are sources cheaper than solar/wind. It all comes down to $$$. Natural Gas is actually decent fuel supply for electrical generation, bc it's a by-product of oil drilling and is almost free

4088 2018-02-15 14:37:13 @theadvertiser has been tone deaf to the downturn in the local economy since the 2014 drop in oil prices. When foreclosures were spiking, they began their “Mansion on the Market” weekly series. And at the same time have increased subscription prices dramatically.  Lost me.

4108 2018-02-15 14:34:55 Safety. One only has to look to the Lac-Magantic tragedy to see how risky large scale rail transport of oil is. None of it is good and if we were freed from our unhealthy dependence on oil we would all be better off. That day isn’t here yet unfortunately

4127 2018-02-15 14:31:56 Bobs not spinning anything here. If you listen to him on air he is completely clear and direct. He knows where the Oil are. It’s just Bob being Bob, throwing random stats out that are sometimes... meaningless.
4128 2018-02-15 14:31:48 Exfoliate once a week to scrub off dead cells that make skin look dull. When skin is freshly exfoliated, lotion and oil are better absorbed.
4129 2018-02-15 14:31:35 As someone who has worked with you before, it really shouldn't matter. If you want to do your work through an oil painting and scan it in, as long as it looks awesome / scales, then I'm fine with that.
4130 2018-02-15 14:31:29 龍之介、無再臨時は絶対顔隠して欲しいんですよ…………なんなら第三再臨ぐらいまで隠してていい…………

4132 2018-02-15 14:31:17 Coconut oil is its own weather forecast system.
4133 2018-02-15 14:31:07 Y eso trabaja con "Fuel oil" ?, se suponía que era con gas natural.
4134 2018-02-15 14:31:06 But EUR is structured with gold marked-to-market qtrly, in order to keep EUR attractive to Arab oil creditors of EU....means EUR gold reserves rise with a rise in the price of gold.  Means EUR should rise relative to USD when gold rises.
4135 2018-02-15 14:31:04 my new oil cartridges are waiting for me in my mailbox why am i working
4136 2018-02-15 14:30:55 Trump in inherited 8 wars from Obama, 2 of which were left-overs from Bush. I'm not going to condemn or anything if at the very least he doesn't start new wars for oil exploration, which Obama did, why else would we bother with Yemen or Somalia.

4146 2018-02-15 14:29:41 feeling the need for some of your health goodness after having your olive oil in one of @SevenSpices cooking classes & @LaportesLewes is gone- how can we get some?
4147 2018-02-15 14:29:38 Why bracket China with India afterall Chinks too are agressor transgressing into as many as 14 countries... Mid-East crisis is not India's cup of Tea, It has more to do with US and Russian Blocks to have larger control on Oil and of course ARMS sale.
4148 2018-02-15 14:29:36 How can you oil anything with those tiny hands?

4157 2018-02-15 14:28:24 Destroying our environment for financial gain, opening our national parks for oil and mining, yeah those things might upset ppl as well.
4158 2018-02-15 14:28:07 Nice! I make homemade goodies for my in-laws. Jams, caramel sauce, and essential oil based gifts . Oh and quick breads. They seem to enjoy them.

4167 2018-02-15 14:26:57 Cut off the nose, to spite the face.  No quicker way to guarantee layoffs in the patch than to "cut off" oil shipments to BC.
4168 2018-02-15 14:26:32 The past week, markets profits rose, getting a higher profit for business owners across Mexico and all of Latin America. Good news for the people but not so much for the regular citizen. This caused a rise in oil prices across the nation.

4174 2018-02-15 14:26:02 Wondering what's Mojo Chicken? It's actually a simpler form of Peri-Peri Chicken. You marinate the chicken with olive oil, spices, vinegar and roasted vegetables overnight. Roast it for an hour the next day. It's healthy and contains the beneficial nutrients of olive oil.
4175 2018-02-15 14:25:58 no problem they can throw out turkey fron Nato..but then they usa and the West will lost Near East and the oil fields. RUSSIA TURKEY AND IRAN as enemies and the us politic is down forever in middle east guy
4176 2018-02-15 14:25:54 CC @JKenney As  the man says oil first struck in 1914 in #TurnerValley. But you weren't born in #Alberta so how would you know? #Carpetbagger
4177 2018-02-15 14:25:39 @PerformancePOil I'm excited that NASCAR is finally getting kicked off as I'm pumped to see the Performance Pure oil truck driven by @DaltonSargeant and Sunday @Tbayne6 and his @roushfenway machine.

4184 2018-02-15 14:24:21 Exactly the point I was making before. Mostly about the oil, nothing more. Give biafrans their crude nd fyt will stop but den yorubas will bring their own demands etc. If I become president, everyone would have what they wantm
4185 2018-02-15 14:24:14 Why chastise someone WH has worked hard for that vacation home and didn’t get the money from the NRA or Coal industry or oil drillers.
4186 2018-02-15 14:23:55 Why are your pancakes so crumbly? 

Because I put oil in them....

But why would you do that?

Um, cuz that’s how I like them  leave me alone 
4187 2018-02-15 14:23:54 Your hashtag is also a lie. There are few jobs benefits for BC and even at the best case scenarios the jobs lost in the tourism and fisheries sectors after a spill will be more than those gained. Also oil is a dying industry so you  forcing this will only provide short term gain
4188 2018-02-15 14:23:51 nahulog ko yung oil blotting sheets ko. dami pa naman non HAHA
4189 2018-02-15 14:23:50 Why not tell Big Oil to stop standing in the way of our future and having a clean environment for generations?
4190 2018-02-15 14:23:26 yes GOLD will keep going.. only way it doesn't is if we see massive deflation and that isn't likely. CHINA and the fact that us PETRO dollars will be challenged by a YUAN denominated CHINESE OIL futures will push dollar lower and GOLD. Gold at 2500 in a year.

4220 2018-02-15 14:20:31 O fetiche pelo oil nos enterrou. Não incentivou nada na economia, apenas a corrupção e a ineficiência alocação, sem falar na maior crise. A poupança que precisamos vira com menor volume de gasto público, e da poupança privada.

4223 2018-02-15 14:20:04 What's more is, I don't even smoke cannabis. I periodically take CBD oil for my back spasms, but that's a whole different bag of cats. I'm perfectly happy with a bottle of MD 20/20 in my hand, but I believe people should be allowed to partake in smoking cannabis if they want to.
4224 2018-02-15 14:20:00 You are talking about break-even price, which is theoretical. The reason they plan the budget on $44 is so that they can issue a conservative number for the deficit. FYI, deficit spending is pretty common, especially for producers at a time of low oil prices.
4225 2018-02-15 14:19:56 Surveyed an oil barons 60ft luxury yacht once (1 of 4 they had). Very poor signal propagation & so hot in the engine room it would probably break AP's.

4247 2018-02-15 14:18:20 Not under Mary fatlip it won't. Did you know north Dakota is one of the richest states? They tax their oil companies much higher than we do. They are in the top 5 for economy, health, and education.
4248 2018-02-15 14:18:04 In order to move boldly into the 21st Century, we must, for some reason, rely on 19th Century Solutions, like coal & oil.

4251 2018-02-15 14:17:58 Rise in crude oil price did. It used to be 29 dollar per barrel but now 90 dollar per barrel.
4252 2018-02-15 14:17:52 Essar Oil sold out to Rosneft/Trafigura/UCP for $13bn to repay loans of banks. ADAG group sold out telecom assets for $4bn & Jaypee group sold cement plants to repay $2.5bn debt
4253 2018-02-15 14:17:31 Stocks surge higher after strong CPI is absorbed without issue

4255 2018-02-15 14:17:27 So Alberta how are YOU going to compensate BC when there is a spill that destroys our natural resources. I cannot understand why it is lawful for one Province to force another Province to risk their land and livelihood in order to allow you to benefit from dirty oil.
4256 2018-02-15 14:17:24 Ohhh tht one mybe oil seed caused by congestion, must extract to get rid. If pki products mmg tk klua bnde tu

4258 2018-02-15 14:16:50 kat situ dia tulis "oil to foam", mungkin mula mula dia oil cleanser then bila kena air, dia jadi foam. 2 in 1 gitu? correct me if I'm wrong 
4259 2018-02-15 14:16:49 Other options would be to put a carbon tax on the electricity we export to them. All oil and gas companies that use local BC suppliers, source that work to other provinces.   Would suggest doing these two and shutting off the pipeline taps all at once.  Then watch the show! 
4260 2018-02-15 14:16:48 It was a combination of food shortages , terrible debt management , poor wealth management ( didn’t invest  when oil prices were good ) overall poor governance.  

As at just two years ago 1 dollar was worth 100 Bv.

Makes what happened in Zimbabwe look like a minor.

4268 2018-02-15 14:16:14 Had to buy some Olive oil. Hopefully @SteveButcher11 will still save some for me  ...
4269 2018-02-15 14:16:13 Tried to make hummus with this blend of 13 beans but added too much oil and it came out like a soup.

1st batch of beans were soupy. Made a 2nd batch with barely any oil to add to the first batch to thicken it but that didn't do shit. Now I just have more soupy beans!!

WTF!?

4274 2018-02-15 14:15:54 The Crude oil in internationally has come down from Rs 4200/ bbl to Rs 3848/bbl but the same has not been passed on to Customers by the Oil Companies. The Govt. must look into it as the Prices of Fuel is on daily basis.@PetroleumMin @TimesNow
4275 2018-02-15 14:15:54 I don’t take anything for my illness which is good because I don’t believe in the medication that’s dished out. Cannabis oil though with little or no THC is an eye opener and it’s natural so not harmful. Problem is that there isn’t enough money for the drug companies and govts

4375 2018-02-15 14:03:09 Yes, I'd rather import oil that's less damaging to the environment. Yes, it is better. It costs a lot less to extract and does not need tons of fresh water.

4404 2018-02-15 13:59:46 Its a joke that country who exports so much oil needs any money in the first place. They have the basic infrastructures

4479 2018-02-15 13:47:24 I think you mean it is you who are carrying out big oil and foreign governments plan to stop Canada from developing its resources. How does it feel to be doing the bidding of Saudi Arabia?
4480 2018-02-15 13:47:13 Don't you think they should have a fiscal plan that could stand up to scrutiny? Don't you think they should have had one in 2013–14 that didn't have oil as a basis?

4546 2018-02-15 13:38:54 Lmao, u can't seem to get a simple point I made? 
Palm oil is not crude oil. I agree they later found crude there, I didn't argue that, but it has nothing to do with palm oil being produced there. In Benue state 4 eg, they have palm oil, do we now say they have crude oil too?

Petrol and oil costs up 145%. 
Tax and insurance up 170%.

Yep. Nothing to see here.

4845 2018-02-15 13:01:41 Simple answer: refiner is a kettle+ pressure cooker. Sweet light oil needs the kettle to separate it. Heavy oil requires pressure cooker to chemically break it down. US refiners have added simple cheap 'kettles' at front of the refinery to deal with shale output.

4989 2018-02-15 12:40:45 I hope you're right. I just don't see it. And I don't trust Tillerson, the ex CEO of Exxon-mobil. Walk away from all that oil in the Kurdish controlled area? Not a chance. Realpolitik

5001 2018-02-15 12:39:14 A gas tax is extremely regressive. Not a fan at all of this idea. I was trying to support my family on a low salary during the OPEC oil crisis.  Was very difficult. Will hurt those trying to enter the workforce at the lower end of the scale.

5013 2018-02-15 12:36:37 They’re lobbyists. Like alcohol, tobacco, oil, etc. It’s up to the politicians.
5014 2018-02-15 12:36:14 Yes. And while Greeks were starving the german troops exported greek oil, olives and even water to their troops in Africa.

5057 2018-02-15 12:30:31 That there is large share of global emissions that come from relatively new (less than 10 years old) coal, oil & gas infrastructure, much of it in Asia. It's much easier to close an old coal plant than a new one. And we need most of these to close to cut CO2. Not pretty picture.

5118 2018-02-15 12:18:10 I think you're getting palm oil (not all of it affects orangutans) and soy mixed up.  90% of soy is fed to livestock so it's not a "vegan issue".  Palm oil is not a vegan issue either.  Soy/palm oil are ubiquitous and any problems associated apply to all those who use them.

5558 2018-02-15 10:53:46 GERS methodology on oil revenue isn't an estimate. Check the methodology documentation. So far your plan is to reverse SNP-supported tax cuts for an industry which is making about £6bn-£7bn a year less than you tried to sell us in 2014. Didn't work then, won't work in the future!

5563 2018-02-15 10:53:04 Good point, but although I'm low-carb, I do occasionally make bread at home for guests (and kids) - with typically just 4 ingredients: water, good flour, yeast and salt (and occasionally a little olive oil). Can I add that to my meatballs?

5568 2018-02-15 10:51:35 Andrew, the increase in allowable emissions for Alberta’s oil and gas sector undermines the credibility of Notley plan, in the eyes of many. That may be unfair but real.

5594 2018-02-15 10:43:15 You've just made up the idea that revenue will increase post Indy. GERS already shows a geographical allocation of oil revenue. As for the tax regime, SNP actively lobbied for tax breaks for the NS operators to save the industry in the N. East. You want to tax it more now???

The UK gave crazy tax breaks to the oil companies, so that's not typical of revenue in the future.

5630 2018-02-15 10:33:34 No . A naval blockade of  sea routes could block  supply of off shore  fuel and restrict trade routes upon which the economy relies. We have no strategic oil reserves with only approximately 90 days of fuel at hand.That’s why energy security is so important.

5695 2018-02-15 10:18:42 I didn't admit anything of the sort.
The oil price is creeping back up to a decent level - 5 million folks are going to see a real benefit - even from a modest revenue - compared to 60 million UK wide.
You need to stop criticising out of hand and start listening.
5696 2018-02-15 10:18:31 RUSSIA: +1.7% still beating most European Equity markets and remains Bullish TREND @Hedgeye as Oil does

5702 2018-02-15 10:16:47 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
5703 2018-02-15 10:16:39 U control a nation's wealth through one bank, like a fedral reserve??it doesn't matter how much oil or how big the army is,, they will be powerless if there is no money..the power behind all wars and what's happing in afrin turkey,, ypg,,iraq,,syria,,korea,, this is the reason.

5706 2018-02-15 10:16:23 But Norway is taking Scottish oil NOW. Some of the largest oilfields on the planet were given to Norway by Westminster but the SG wont fight to get these back from Norwegian control.
5707 2018-02-15 10:15:39 Cod liver oil with om3 & 6 in right ratio, unsweetened elderberry extract, sodium ascorbate or liposomal C, on top of ur basic keto focused diet. Non food things like hugs, massage, gd self esteem, exercise, sleep etc all count too. #vaxxed #nojabnopay

5710 2018-02-15 10:14:28 You just admitted that iScot couldn't rely on oil revenues to close the ongoing systemic deficit (you can't have an oil fund AND spend it!). Good.

Now we've settled that, how do you close the deficit?

5713 2018-02-15 10:14:09 So we have the same skin condition... Okay means i gotta stop then cleanse and find yg takda mineral oil lah kan sbb can clog pores
5714 2018-02-15 10:13:52 We use flaxseed for my son who can't have dairy eggs and coconut or its oil. (And lately hates meat so he's basically vegan lol) I personally love nuts, preferably roasted almonds mmmmm. Fruit and veggie smoothies with a protein powder or nuts are great
5715 2018-02-15 10:13:32 I don’t particularly like the idea of putting anything bigger than a shovel in the ground but I’m also a realist and hate it when we have to depend on foreign oil.
5716 2018-02-15 10:12:56 i saw a great opening in the Oil and gas industry where alot of stake holders were invited by the president.
5717 2018-02-15 10:12:26 The media does not report it like that. Eating just green vegetables would make you ill too. Heaving a positive relationship with food and eating a varied diet is healthy. A chicken nugget is chicken with a bit of breadcrumbs and oil, hardly as bad as smoking.
5718 2018-02-15 10:12:17 Isn't Norway like it is because of massive oil income ?
5719 2018-02-15 10:12:13 Essential oil bath with rose pedals type of night
5720 2018-02-15 10:11:52 Did that yesterday after giving it a service. New set of blades and an oil change. Nice.
5721 2018-02-15 10:11:50 I bet that extra virgin olive oil calls virgin olive oil names like slut and hoe.
5722 2018-02-15 10:11:44 Did the crude oil say don’t refine me!

5729 2018-02-15 10:10:01 So we can expect groceries to sky rocket, due to increased fuel costs, and more of our hard earned money going straight to big oil instead of into the economy. What a great plan!
5730 2018-02-15 10:09:50 Qui s'occupe des milliers de locuteurs et locutrices des langues d'oïl régionales ? Elles qui ont tant donné au français !!!! #monideepourlefrancais
5731 2018-02-15 10:09:40 I totally agree @martinwarioba To add to the "confusion" this imported oil uses our very own exported sunflower seed cake and when repackaged its labelled #MadeInTZ but is it?  The entire Policy and Regulatory Framework for Industriliasation needs to be looked at afresh.

5738 2018-02-15 10:08:22 Then it told me to take cbd oil
5739 2018-02-15 10:08:18 I am still liking it. I don’t use it every day but I admit I’m a picker so when that happens I throw on the oil and for me it calms my skin down. I use La Roche Posay duo also and my skin is better than it has been in a while
5740 2018-02-15 10:08:04 I’m ridiculously tired and want to take a nap when I get home from work and I’m not even at work yet...and I’m getting an oil change after work so I can’t even nap. Holy crap.

5746 2018-02-15 10:06:48 40 previous years of squandered oil revenue has left us with no reserve to mitigate the rise and fall of the oil price.
A UK failing.
iScotland would start an oil fund, so your scenario is meaningless.
Oil revenue for 5 million is a helluva lot more per head than for 60 million.
5747 2018-02-15 10:06:26 Are you talking about why 2T is added to 2-stroke bikes? It because of the way the 2-stroke engines are built, needs oil with fuel to reduce wear & tear inside the cylinder.
5748 2018-02-15 10:06:23 You're happy to send your kids off to die fighting for control of an oil field?

5755 2018-02-15 10:05:27 A particular voice from the north said Oil isn't from Niger-Delta it is from Nigeria.

5769 2018-02-15 10:02:56 I think the Sukuk was less discretionary so they had to allocate cash equally to all regions.

For me, costs in the SS provide further evidence for resource control. I believe they have oil/gas because it’s more difficult to build stuff there. Its their natural helping hand.

5786 2018-02-15 09:59:05 One of the key problems is that we allow importers to bring in refined oil and repackage for local market. They compete directly with local producers and usually they have better prices. Our tax policies should incentivize local manufacturing

5968 2018-02-15 09:10:34 The flow of cash is currently from rUK to Scotland. That’s one of the benefits of the union-when oil revenues are as low as now we can still afford the needed higher public spending levels per head that we have. Indy destroys that.

5984 2018-02-15 09:06:13 Not exactly sure about the yearly one but I know that you need to change the engine oil regularly. 

For example, I pay around 50,000LL for the 5K kms oil. It’s recommended to change it every three months or once u pass 5K . Fi other types that last longer but price will differ.

5994 2018-02-15 09:03:00 One hopes so. But Air India is not an asset, while the banks and oil companies are. For instance, banks loaned money to ONGC to buy HPCL's govt stake helping them to meet the disinvestment target. Also, ONGC and a couple of other PSU's provided part funds for the Patel Statue.

6013 2018-02-15 08:58:18 Haven’t asked for detail, just the extent of the cuts you’d be prepared to make in pursuit of a minority obsession.

6018 2018-02-15 08:57:13 It took HOURS. We ended up dry-frying most of them - even with the salt prep, when we tried to deep fry they each absorbed about 100ml oil

6020 2018-02-15 08:56:49 That’s true, I like to use the natural fat, say cooking the chicken skin down to render its own fat to cook in. Then maybe a touch of butter to brighten a potato up or some olive oil and lemon to make a salad sing.
6021 2018-02-15 08:56:10 The second will come when the oil runs out and the $$ is worthless.

6042 2018-02-15 08:51:22 Fantastic. Now show me what the expected net revenue is...

Oh and please remember that the Growth Commission have stated very publicly that oil revenue won't be used for day to day spending but for inter-generational projects...

So net revenue is nil.

6091 2018-02-15 08:38:03 I was in Zone 2, Onikan yesterday. 
Don't ask me how it went. You all can guess...
Money for service.
The oil servicing the engine called Nigeria is almost finished.
Soviet Union collapsed overnight. 
Nigeria might disintegrate in just a couple of hours.
6092 2018-02-15 08:37:28 นิ่มสิ มันกี่วันแล้ว 555 รสชาติโอเคใช่มั๊ย
6093 2018-02-15 08:37:01 아이코 아녜요! 저야말로 저 기억해주셔서 감사할 따름ᆢ 앞으로도 오래 뵈어요ㅎㅎ 늘 감사합니다♡
6094 2018-02-15 08:36:08 Please show up today oil, my little toes are cold.
6095 2018-02-15 08:36:02 มันนิ่มไปอ่ะอาจจะเพราะนานแต่รสชาติโอเคอ่ะ
6096 2018-02-15 08:35:40 Papagas pa sana ako sa sea’oil eh
6097 2018-02-15 08:35:25 In short sha 

“Oud” is used to refer to both the resin-saturated wood (the agarwood) as well as the oil distilled from it. One reason oud is so expensive is its rarity; by some estimates, fewer than 2% of wild agar trees produce it.
6098 2018-02-15 08:35:16 What oil are you using
6099 2018-02-15 08:34:37 The decline comes at a bad time for #EquatorialGuinea #Angola, #Nigeria #Libya #Cameroon  which need high and stable oil prices if they are to succeed in turning the planned  infrastructure projects to give their economy a shot in the arm. #OOTT #OPEC #OIL.
6100 2018-02-15 08:34:36 The only way US citizens can make changes in this country is to stop voting for politicians who receive donations from the Kock brothers, big oil and gas, the NRA, big pharma etc. Do your homework and hold these corrupt politicians accountable or simply don’t vote for them.
6101 2018-02-15 08:34:29 ยังไม่ได้ลองอ่ะ
6102 2018-02-15 08:34:24 So get out of Syria @POTUS
@realDonaldTrump ,we shouldn't help Israel 's oil profeteers
6103 2018-02-15 08:34:00 Transparency of OPEC and Russia would be a first step. And maybe enough, no "new way to measure oil inventories" needed then, as most people know how to use a calculator.
6104 2018-02-15 08:33:57 Wagner PMC, employed by Russia from Russian Forces in Syria as an anonymous commando, is vbrutalizing Syrians to gain oil control!
6105 2018-02-15 08:33:32 I'd forgotten you mentioned attending! It's been a while, maybe Derby? Yes I think they're generally more upbeat than last year, Oil Price allowing capital budgets - PMC orders picking up, CSC doing well in Defence, still quiet with Drillships, Bio-Gas frustrating.... #PRES (1/?)

6107 2018-02-15 08:33:02 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt. #Tucson
6108 2018-02-15 08:33:00 You mean Nigerian Banks run the way Cecelia, Erastus & co did? The same oil companies that are neck deep in bad debts being taken over by AMCON? The point is We worship and idolise paper certificates here at the detriment of competence and experience
6109 2018-02-15 08:32:43 What is the worst and funniest direct translation you've ever heard?

Mine is "makhura a ngwana kego rumiwa = the fish oil of the son is to be sent"

Let's hear yours...
6110 2018-02-15 08:32:41 But where is EV policy? Nudge state owned oil companies to setup charging stations & invest in technology. Stop registring fossil fuel run vehicles for intra city public transport. Implement retiring old vehicle policy.
6111 2018-02-15 08:32:35 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
6112 2018-02-15 08:32:16 I would need to slide those panties off first wouldn't want to get any oil on them
6113 2018-02-15 08:32:05 Nak kena try HL cleansing oil, senka cleansing oil lagi buat muka akubjadi sensitive 
6114 2018-02-15 08:31:50 Busiest airport in Europe apparently, and I could believe that! Helicopters in and out all day going to the oil rigs. You get used to it though, and there's still wildlife about

6118 2018-02-15 08:30:07 Oil prices have slid nearly 15 percent in the past three weeks, together with a broader decline in the stock market, due to fears about global inflation and rising U.S. oil production. #OOTT #OPEC #OIL
6119 2018-02-15 08:29:16 Oud (in Arabian ‘oudh’) is highly valued by perfumers for its sweet, woody, aromatic and complex scent. It is used in forms of oud oil (dehn al oud) or raisin (oud mubakhar). The oil of oud, whether extracted by distillation from wood, or by melting the raisin, is non-irritating
6120 2018-02-15 08:28:38 Ur helping a NRA backed orange fruit gain acceptability thru ur pics, interviews etc. U expect anything from him? Ur as deluded as Trump in that case. The republicans who ctrl govt, don't wanna ctrl gun sales. Arms manufacturing is d only thing big in the US wid oil& pharma now
6121 2018-02-15 08:28:13 #OPEC would do better to leave the oil market slightly short of supplies rather than ending too early a deal on cutting output @Khalid_AlFalih, @AfricaOilPower @IbeKachikwu
6122 2018-02-15 08:27:34 Not one drop of Alberta oil is used to power vehicles. They'd need a refinery for that, not a pipeline.
6123 2018-02-15 08:27:13 Aviation stocks tumbled on sharp surge in Brent crude oil futures yesterday, 14  February 2018. Jet Airways (India) was down 6%, SpiceJet 2.17% and InterGlobe  Aviation 0.31%.

6125 2018-02-15 08:26:38 Believe me, you are wasting your time with these lot. Hating the rich privileged kid.., oil money., etc doesn't take away the fact that a once "Small Club" is striving to take its place among the so called big boys, & not everyone is gonna like that, that's the reality of life.
6126 2018-02-15 08:26:36 wwwwwwwww

6143 2018-02-15 08:22:45 But we only import crude oil which has been record cheap recently. The petroleum products are made here.

6152 2018-02-15 08:20:10 If you were a better EPA director and gave a damn about our environment instead of slashing budget, being in big oil pockets, cared about clean air and water and our  National Monuments perhaps you would have less unpleasant "interactions" You work for the people not Trump.
6153 2018-02-15 08:20:09 in my opinion this is overbought right now and needs a down move to keep going up
6154 2018-02-15 08:20:08 One Tylenol bottle opened with toxic ingredients inside , revealing hundreds of others , now we all struggle mightily to open a plastic bottle filled with any condiment , medicine or other oil produced based damned jar of crap

6168 2018-02-15 08:17:59 Market Factors Feb 15: Oil prices on Thursday extended gains from the previous session, pushed up by a weak dollar and by comments from Saudi Arabia that it would rather see an undersupplied market than end a deal with OPEC and Russia to withhold production.

6181 2018-02-15 08:15:29 Thank you! But pls donate that same money to Democrats’ campaigns. Even if the GOP took you up on your offer, they’d act slow with legislation AND they’d still be bought out by oil, pharmaceuticals, etc.
6182 2018-02-15 08:15:27 At that time crude oil prices were $150 barrel and now is just near about $60 ...come with the facts then talk

6193 2018-02-15 08:13:17 Bullshit.  Alberta has giveaway royalty rates which is why you have nothing to show for all the oil produced.  And tankers are only required to carry a MAXIMUM of $160 million insurance.  A major spill costs billions to clean up so we are subsidizing the industry.  Do yr homework

6215 2018-02-15 08:09:33 Exactly. If they want the Gas and Oil here they have to come here to get it. They can't have it made in sweat shops in Vietnam. Our politicians need to quit taking their money and recognize that we have the bull by the balls and it's time to squeeze with relentless pressure.

6220 2018-02-15 08:08:21 Why!!!! Iraq is wealthy oil exporting nation !
6221 2018-02-15 08:08:12 The same  northerners turned around in 1958 as soon as oil was discovered at Oloibiri town in Bayelsa state and started singing, we are for independence because of Niger delta God given wealth. What hypocrisy can be more than this ?

6325 2018-02-15 07:41:49 While diversification of economy is good for sustainable growth, oil is not necessarily Nigeria's problem. Leadership is. Late Hugo Chavez steered the economy considerably well until his demise. Then enters the puppet Maduro and everything begins to go down south.

After Libya, Nigeria to raise production from current 1.8MBPD to 2.5MBPD by 2020 & Angola to start production from 0.25MBPD in end 2018. Interesting to see meeting regarding OPEC production curbs in June 2018

6667 2018-02-15 06:36:10 I had to give up oil painting because of lack of resources (space). How does one rectify that?

6670 2018-02-15 06:34:53 Why would we want to do that? No one has even suggested it. In fact, the global supply glut has allowed the oil sands to consolidate (CNRL, CNQ) in order to reduce costs in the face of protracted low prices. In a way, the play has been regionalized.
6671 2018-02-15 06:34:36 Fighting add oil
6672 2018-02-15 06:34:23 Nothing special . Pray, drink more water . Avoid applying heat to your hear, try to use organic products (coconut oil , shea butter , black soap ). I use Cantu  too
6673 2018-02-15 06:34:18 I heard that the renewable energy industry provides more jobs than oil.

6676 2018-02-15 06:33:33 Nobody walks into a recreational dispensary and gets 20-1 CBD-THC chemovar (flower) for recreational purposes. This will be even more true for oil chemovars. Cannabis isn't a homogenous drug and therefore you can't create a "black and white" tax plan including both rec and med.

6724 2018-02-15 06:23:38 The NEP did not amplify the global downturn of the early 80s, a consequence of earlier high oil prices, consequent decline in demand, inflation, then stagflation. Albertans were living in a bubble and the bubble popped. Did they learn anything? Seems not.

6751 2018-02-15 06:19:16 Alberta has a myth problem. Too many people and companies thought the oil boom would last forever and made personal and business decisions on that basis. They got caught. They saved face by blaming Ottawa. American oil companies wanted to maintain their grip on Alberta. Now? Meh.

6753 2018-02-15 06:18:17 Yes. 

Add 4-5 drops of Soulflower Rosemary Essential Oil in 1 teaspoon of Soulflower Coconut Oil. Whisk until it reduces a smooth consistency & evenly apply it to your hair & scalp.Leave it overnight. Wash off with lukewarm water.Use it daily for faster hair growth.

Thank you.

6770 2018-02-15 06:16:05 This is not a dashboard of a vehicle that in on the road. Check the oil temperature gauge is at the very minimum and time is so much ahead. ~internet photo
6771 2018-02-15 06:16:00 i bought a serum too but i personally like the smell of coconut oil better, and it IS cheaper, i also use it for food too so it all works out haha
6772 2018-02-15 06:15:59 What kind of fish? What are you eating it with?

Lemon juice, salt, olive oil, and pepper is a classic combo.

 It's a little too late to marinate it which is always a good option. Same with breading it.
6773 2018-02-15 06:15:46 I was feeling so nauseous on the way to Chicago and even when we got to the restaurant. It was super bad and I usually don’t feel that way, but I drank this one essential oil and I felt so much better. It’s crazy how well it worked
6774 2018-02-15 06:15:18 Wish our leaders are responsible like @POTUS that manages his Twitter account himself, maybe they'll listen to us more @SPNigeria 3 months of fuel scarcity in a country rich in crude oil @MBuhari

6776 2018-02-15 06:14:35 Do you use the coconut oil for smoothing? Because you can use a smoothing serum or hair oil (although coconut oil is much cheaper)

6791 2018-02-15 06:11:05 I lived in a cabin that didn't have water, sold my gun, my truck, tv, & guitar to keep food on the table, a roof over my head, & oil in the tank. I've been poor. I was on snap the last 4 months of school when I ran out of everything to sell or odd jobs to do. Choices.

6798 2018-02-15 06:10:11 Just a reminder. Irving Oil said that even if EE were constructed, the company would reserve the right to import oil. It's a business decision, right? KXL is hung up in Nebraska. Line 3 is hung up in Minnesota. It would be a good thing if the Capline reversal proposal were a go.

6801 2018-02-15 06:10:02 Does SA have an SGR or even oil? We should export one of our presidents to them so he can assist with railway devt and oil exploration since he's become a past master at doing those two.
6802 2018-02-15 06:09:58 I’ve been wanting to try that! My acne only acts up on one of my cheeks and not even concealer covers up my scars :/ we’re on the same boat. Try the oil out tho, you can find a cheap jar at Ross

6811 2018-02-15 06:06:44 And I used some eucalyptus oil to help me breath and now it got my eyes wide open and almost burning and it’s time for me to be sleep

6815 2018-02-15 06:05:28 Majory Stoneman Douglas was an environmentalist that worked for The Miami Herald until her death at 108 yrs old. She is credited with conserving the Everglades. Trump by executive order rescinded the Everglades National Park protections and granted permission for oil exploration.
6816 2018-02-15 06:05:26 It's interesting to read about the evolution of energy usage and distribution in the US.  I did not know that 70% of the coal, oil, and gas used to create electricity is wasted through heat and released into the atmosphere.  #sustainable_engineering
6817 2018-02-15 06:05:11 Every oil field is a different geology and has different depletion rates.  Of course the amount extracted is the most in the first 3-6 months but i find it very hard to believe someone has accurate global well depletion rate research. Simply due to lack of transparency.
6818 2018-02-15 06:04:30 Passing off plantations (including palm oil), boulevards and gardens defeats the purpose of natural history conservation. Green Cover is not necessarily "Forest" Cover. True "forest" is still below 4% and eroding...we are all aware of this statistical juggling...

If you want a love message to be heard, it has got to be sent out. To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it.

6835 2018-02-15 06:00:42 Would be great to add the chance of an oil spill, e.g. for how many tankers (or oil volume) transported vs. chance of that much oil spilled. Just from financial aspect, if the oil export through BC is going to add 10s of trillions to our wealth, 0.1 trillion budget acceptable.

6837 2018-02-15 06:00:30 @chelseahandler The root of this evil (Russia-gate; school shootings; tax breaks for the rich; etc.) is (lack of) proper campaign finance laws.  The highest bidder (Koch brothers; NRA; big oil; etc) wins.  Republicans told us so in the days before the tax reform package.
6838 2018-02-15 06:00:29 What are you basing that on? Latest studies show that it’s actually easier to clean up than conventional oil. Is it dangerous in other ways?
6839 2018-02-15 06:00:25 Iraq Says $4 billion Needed for New Downstream Oil Investments
6840 2018-02-15 06:00:24 We refine oil here in B.C. then sell it and ship it away. We actually get about 50% from Alberta the rest come from here and Washington so I’m not sure that would do any good for either province since you aren’t really set up to send it to the prairies
6841 2018-02-15 06:00:07 I agree. Our oil, our wealth. And the earlier we realize this, the better for us all.
6842 2018-02-15 06:00:04 It’s probably to few healthy fats, how much coconut oil and butter have you been eating/drinking lately? If the answer is not much, you might want to make some cocoa with some of both blended in before bed

6852 2018-02-15 05:56:57 You could put the funding anywhere and it would be better than oil industry reinvesting in new drilling

6855 2018-02-15 05:55:15 We did not have the knowledge of the impact human activity has on the environment. And although EXXON and other oil companies knew about it because their scientists conducting private experiments (1970’s) advised them of problems. Not one word made public.

6857 2018-02-15 05:55:06 You can thank your hero Obama for the bailouts. There are no big oil subsides.
You're fed lies by Democrats and you all believe them. They don't care about you. If you would get deported, they'd just bring in 100K kids from central America. They could've given you Amnesty in 2010
6858 2018-02-15 05:55:03 The whole world was behind the effort in 2001. We (the west) could have showed that we cared about a quarrelsome broken-arse country, instead of just oil. Then we invaded Iraq.
6859 2018-02-15 05:54:59 @BudgetTruck the repair guy was awesome but the location allowed a truck with a blown fuse to drive out?  Sorry but a PMI should be more than just check the wheels and oil levels.  Those fuses govern tow lights.

6863 2018-02-15 05:54:08 Disappointingly poor reporting @TheEconomist ... is there no civil war where polygamy is not widely practiced? You also suggest Islam is the only religion that practices some form of it. And way to reduce women to a commodity like water, oil or gold.

6884 2018-02-15 05:49:33 How about helping get Canadian oil to tide water ports, take advantage of full market prices. Even US is self sufficient and we can't even get oil across our own country but receive shipments from middle east into eastern ports. Billions of revenues lost and added costs annually.

6887 2018-02-15 05:49:12 I can not even imagine. The waiting. The eventual, heartbreaking news of many.

We MUST use our tears to oil the REAL machinery of ACTION. How many "MORES" must happen until "no more" is truly "NO MORE!"

6932 2018-02-15 05:41:25 Winter dries my skin so bad. Have you tried calendula oil for your body? I can recommend something for your face too but don’t know your type. My face was so dry this winter I had to use raw Shea butter on it.

6937 2018-02-15 05:40:30 I say this is bullshit, trump fudges numbers and only reports what he wants people to see. He is a snake oil salesman. His admin will report any number that makes his tax cut for the wealthy look like its doing good. He's added more snakes to the swamp than there ever was.

6966 2018-02-15 05:35:39 If you believe in CO2 AGW, then no. Using electricity for automobiles does not make sense because EVs are so inefficient. Norway's electricity could be used in the European grid to reduce the 75% of its electricity fr. coal, oil & gas.  Much better to use gas or diesel for autos.

7004 2018-02-15 05:30:16 U.S. produces ~9M barrels of oil each day. And that should increase significantly with Moron wanting to drill/frack everywhere. Tax every barrel of oil, not each gallon of gasoline. Could come out about even for us. With the ever-increasing supply, oil prices will drop.

7017 2018-02-15 05:27:45 You are completely correct. But I don’t think his daddy loves him. So I do believe or hope he actually works in the oil field because they do make good money maybe just maybe he’ll hire someone to talk shit for him because he’s just embarrassing himself

I realized something on my way home tonight. When I got my oil changed earlier today, my speedometer wasn’t giving me the correct speed I was going, or so I thought. Turns out my gage was changed to show kilometers instead of miles. I thought it was broken.

It's a good feeling 
7050 2018-02-15 05:20:36 Clearly you've forgotten the Winnipeg Agreement. The PET gov't bailed out Syncrude when Atlantic Richfield backed out of its 30% stake. Then there were the Chrétien ACCA tax-breaks given to the oil sands in 1996 worth $300m/year until 2010-4 when the Harperites phased them out.

7071 2018-02-15 05:16:57 try putting a couple drops of tea tree (Melaluca) oil in the water.
7072 2018-02-15 05:16:44 What is beard oil? Is that a figurative or literal title? Also it's worth mentioning that I typoed that as 'bear oil' at first! ;)

7085 2018-02-15 05:13:04 Thanks  

I have fairly “normal” skin (not oily and not dry) the coconut oil feels oily when first applied but honestly will soak in after a few minutes. I use it at night and by morning there’s no sign of it affecting my skin type by making it oily. (1/?)

7087 2018-02-15 05:12:06 It’s crazy to think that we have regulations on things that’s way less harmless like weed and oil but the @GOP could care less about having reasonable #guncontrol. A firearm literally can take a life in an instant. But they act as if it’s harmless.

7103 2018-02-15 05:09:32 The US never took over Iraq, we only wanted their leader out & (& we will deny this) a pass to their oil.We went there under the guise of saving the Iraqi people from their  leader at the time. Kuwait didn't have much to do with it, if my memory serves me. I could be wrong.

7113 2018-02-15 05:06:36 It’s mostly oil. 
7114 2018-02-15 05:06:32 because the cost of crude oil aint free, the cost of our gas is determined by the cost of crude oil, taxes, etc. and during like seasonal demand, gas prices tend to fluctuate so gas will like never be free im sorry
7115 2018-02-15 05:06:10 This pretty well sums up the @realDonaldTrump world. We're going to educate our kids behind castle walls and if you get too close we'll drop boiling oil on you.

7180 2018-02-15 04:56:25 I live in rural Alberta. There is currently a crime epidemic. Got worse after oil dropped & the hardships began. The problem is we don’t have enough police. People cannot count on a fast police response. The “decent” thieves rob you in the day, the bad guys come at night, armed.
7181 2018-02-15 04:56:02 My husband never does anything for any holiday or anniversary.

7209 2018-02-15 04:50:51 hey guys I just want to let you all know that smoking WEED is NOT cool. instead inhale the vapors of an oil diffuser (I prefer lavender tbh)
7210 2018-02-15 04:50:30 lightly fry it up with a little olive oil OR heat some water, and soak it in it for a minute or two
7211 2018-02-15 04:50:19 He's an RFA who needs to be signed to a bridge deal. What guys sign for on 6-8 yr deals matter little...they'd be foolish to sign him to that with their current predicament.

7216 2018-02-15 04:49:39 Tea tree oil would be good to kill those bacteria.
7217 2018-02-15 04:49:33 Tell the Alta govt to stop being toadies for big Texas oil and refine the oil at home. Hopeless mismanagement of the oil biz for decades!
7218 2018-02-15 04:49:25 The sad thing about this, is that you can extract some oil from any living matter.  TFA, SFA, it doesn't matter.  Whole foods are always better.  We can demonize whatever.  Whole foods without additives and without extraction are best.

7228 2018-02-15 04:48:01 Only to get hit with “ all I do is drink water & use coconut oil “ 
7229 2018-02-15 04:47:59 I agree on most points but don’t agree on many present Day uses of oil based products. Burning gas & diesel for transportation is 19th century & must stop.Same goes for producing 1million plastic bottles / min & only 9% recycled. We should all be VERY ashamed.
7230 2018-02-15 04:47:46 I got tapenade oil on my dress. What a way to end the day @SirenDeluxe
7231 2018-02-15 04:47:24 "So uh......*looks you up and down* I heard you need an oil change. Lets see how we can fix that for you miss?" *she says her name* annnnnnd you know what happens next lol
7232 2018-02-15 04:46:38 Yay the splatter screen I bought works well. Last time I cooked chicken everything in the kitchen had a sheen of oil on it after I was done, but not this time. It’s the little things.
7233 2018-02-15 04:46:38 I used to love hearing stories when I was a child of mythology, 40 haramies who live in the arabian desert and steal everything. I learnt more through storry telling... Hey Saudi Haramies the OIL belongs to us all. How about sharing and caring, Remember your father Abraham....
7234 2018-02-15 04:46:32 If you’re looking at the market value, that’s what it is. FWIW - Klefbom comparable for young Dman coming off ELC was Larsson. Internally I agree $4.1M is the number, but we’re talking market value, and a guy who says “that’s the price you have to pay” #Oilers
7235 2018-02-15 04:46:26 Someone tell @realDonaldTrump that Parkland lost oil instead of young lives, and he'll hop right on it.
7236 2018-02-15 04:46:05 Please post a screenshot where I said oil was renewable.  You have now resorted to personal insults - you have conceded - got it.
7237 2018-02-15 04:45:46 Dealing with a murder in #LANoire and reporters are asking relevant questions until some guy hits me with: “If olive oil comes from an olive, where does baby oil come from?”
7238 2018-02-15 04:45:43 Food
Made soup. Well, more like oil, water, spices and pepper heated up. Still warms me up and smells good  so yay.

7243 2018-02-15 04:45:20 Do you eat olives, do you eat sunflowers, do you eat peanuts; all contain vegoils.  The processing is mostly the removal of the oil from the seed, etc. to make the oil  usable for our cooking processes
7244 2018-02-15 04:45:11 i poured castor oil all over myself in the shower

7254 2018-02-15 04:43:27 Why? Don't  you want AMERICANS in need to be feed? We send rice,flour,cooking oil, along with $$ as foreign aid. So what's the problem? If I was hungry...I would say thank you 4 the Staples....or is the EBT BEING DIVERTED.?? Protest too much
7255 2018-02-15 04:43:10 Exxon couldn't even beat the earnings estimate in rising oil prices in 4th Quarter, hence price came down from 89 to 76 in the matter of days. Glut everywhere. These companies will kill themselves.

7258 2018-02-15 04:42:37 25 years of inaction and soft talk diplomacy is what has ultimately lead to North Korea having nuclear weapons.

You can drive your car around with no oil in the engine but eventually bad things will happen.
7259 2018-02-15 04:42:16 So wait? The Govt won’t do anything about gun control so as consolation the tax payers are paying for funerals for kids killed by a gunman? That doesn’t make sense...that’s like not changing your oil ever, but setting up a fund For when your engine blows...

7265 2018-02-15 04:41:17 Then let’s set are sights on those who receive millions from oil and energy companies. That will lower gas and energy prices for us all!!!
7266 2018-02-15 04:41:11 Why dont you build a refinery or two and at least sell a finished product as well as doing something to supply Canadians with cheaper fuel instead of loading dirty oil sands onto ships and risking sensitive marine enviroments.
7267 2018-02-15 04:41:04 cosmoderm i taktahu, but bio oil can also hilangkan scar dkt muka! cz kawan i guna and i pun try guna

7273 2018-02-15 04:39:43 We already pay enough in taxes on the gas. What happens when oil goes back up and we’re at 5 buck plus a gallon again?!
7274 2018-02-15 04:39:33 Hundreds of Russian mercenaries were killed by US airstrikes near an oil field in #DeirEzzor Syria along with pro Assad militas just yesterday, too bad the #Kremlin won't do anything about it, the numbskulls( #skullsandbones ) must be celebrating.

7276 2018-02-15 04:39:09 Wow, @DoctorNerdly, that's your best argument - loss of a cow compared to today's loss of 17 children and school employees? In 2018 we have had school shootings every other school day, but at least your grandfather has heating oil and his cows are safe. Good to know.
7277 2018-02-15 04:39:05 Keep the outrageous spending under control. Ramp up oil, coal etc. Get rid of the carbon tax and lower all taxes by 20%. Encourage investment not chase it away. Eliminate union powers. Unions have there usefulness but have way to much power.
7278 2018-02-15 04:38:53 I finally got some vitamin E oil instead of the cream
7279 2018-02-15 04:38:49 I don’t think it’s possible for me to fully relax without Lavender essential oil

7287 2018-02-15 04:37:48 Remember when we had lead in our gasoline and the oil industry hired experts to shut down the research of the ONE GUY who said that might be a major issue, and drug him through the court system while death counts skyrocketed?
7288 2018-02-15 04:37:37 I encourage you to research how many oil spills there are in relation to how much volume is shipped. you find the answer is almost negligible. But the real question is why would you rather support the Middle East rather then your own countryman. Do you just hate Albertans?
7289 2018-02-15 04:37:27 Been a min since I been off the oil
7290 2018-02-15 04:37:14 I took my makeup off with my sample of Clinique’s Take the Day Off cleansing balm and I NEED a full size now. Starts off as a balm. Put it on and it becomes an oil. Rinse and it turns into a milk. Its fan-fucking-tastic Im shook.

7295 2018-02-15 04:36:23 Don't forget ALEC, the Koch brother's legislative subsidiary that wrote "stand your ground, and other legislative atrocities.

I'd ask what the Kochs' Russia connection might be, but, ... well, ...yeah, it's oil.

The Kochs stand to benefit YUGELY from Trump lifting sanctions.

7300 2018-02-15 04:35:59 Mini prizepacks! Like $25 starbucks card, couple of nail basics (oil, peel off base coat, glossy taco), a gift card for school supplies (maybe amazon?) And a Beynnn shirt? That way a bunch of people can win and its all related to Christine's platform!
7301 2018-02-15 04:35:32 just say they’re fighting for oil and not for freedom that usually makes them go rabid
7302 2018-02-15 04:35:29 The amount of massage oil that I’ve sold to day is insane

7305 2018-02-15 04:35:04 A mad musk after a sheet mask? Hmm. Mud masks usually help with oil control, sheet masks hydrate. You should do the mud mask then the sheet mask.
7306 2018-02-15 04:34:54 Tulsa, OK. Tons of incredible Art Deco there from the oil boom
7307 2018-02-15 04:34:33 Alberta will survive in the long term and so will Canada. Bitumen is a dangerous substance that will destroy our oceans and rivers when it gets spilled. Oil jobs are going the way of the blacksmiths when cars came. Time to adapt and move on to new technologies and jobs.

7309 2018-02-15 04:34:17 The goals keep coming in Victoria. The Oil Kings lead the Royals 5-4 after 40 minutes. Brayden Gorda (1) and Tomas Soustal (14) tally in the 2nd for Edmonton. Kade Jensen (5) replied for the Royals. Shots 22-20 Victoria.

7311 2018-02-15 04:34:06 3) I was 9. She did his Portrait using Pastels not oil. Looked exactly like him.  Her art lured you in as if you couldn't stop staring at it. All I know is the Owner hung it over the Bar at the Court of Two Sisters in New Orleans around 1960. Don't know what happened to it...
7312 2018-02-15 04:34:05 This hot six oil really saved my hair
7313 2018-02-15 04:34:05 I gently brushed the underside with olive oil so it would crisp up. And used prosciutto instead of pate. Just made the mistake of buying the tenderloin late and only finding end pieces 
7314 2018-02-15 04:34:02 Y’all, on god, no drug has me sleeping as good as ONE (1) squirt of magnesium oil on the soles of my feet and it’s a crime that it took me until now to find out about it. Please review my extensive drug resume as proof of my sincerity.
7315 2018-02-15 04:34:00 Pretty laughable exaggeration.  And that photo is from pipeline damage caused by a City of Burnaby contractor.  It's just oil, not kryptonite.

7321 2018-02-15 04:32:57 Her inferior processing ability meant that you received more fuel oil than you needed, and she couldn't reprocess light naptha which got sold internationally for a loss. Oil marketing companies refused to continue taking the losses.
7322 2018-02-15 04:32:34 No worries, Pal. And I get that, but with the constant delays Canada is losing out on massive revenue streams. Canadian oil prices can’t rise if we can’t get it to market. KM has met every one of an extensive reqs list to ensure it’s the world’s safest.
7323 2018-02-15 04:32:17 My husband burned himself on oil and I'm mocking him.  Living with a chronic pain patient means no sympathy ever, unfortunately. I kissed his boo-boo then told him to stop being a baby.

7326 2018-02-15 04:31:51 @obyezeks I am appauled at how U describe squandering of oil revenues under GEJ. But am more surprised at how ur deliberately refuse to recognize appreciable infrastructure developments. Not the best interms of the need but not the worst interms of the deliberate efforts.

7337 2018-02-15 04:30:29 This really isn’t a gun  problem. Our society is sick. Our culture needs a giant dose of castor oil and a big shot of reality about life and the things we prioritize.

Speaking from my friend's experience.
7355 2018-02-15 04:25:58 Rub me down with black seed oil
7356 2018-02-15 04:25:58 โอ้ ชหแล้ว55555
7357 2018-02-15 04:25:44 Your MCM couldn’t chainge the oil on his two stroke scooter.
7358 2018-02-15 04:25:27 And Tina Joemat Peterson, least we forget SA’s strategic oil reserves 
7359 2018-02-15 04:25:21 Edmonton's Soustal scores. Oil Kings go up 5-4. 5:51 remains in the 2nd period.
7360 2018-02-15 04:25:01 I’d love to see a 600+ round a minute rifle you can buy at a gun shop. I couldn’t imagine how many barrels you have to rotate out for that and how much oil is needed.
7361 2018-02-15 04:24:37 On your jaw too!  Box or Beaury Supply? I am seriously getting tired of chemicals to keep the gray away.  A good brand burned my scalp. There is a Customer Service phone number on the side of box. I ususally use Garnier.with avocado oil & It smells good.

7363 2018-02-15 04:24:00 There is no rise in the price of crude oil there has not been a rise in the last six months what is the cause of the sporadic monthly rise in the cost of petrol?is  ERC stealing from us like KPLC .
7364 2018-02-15 04:23:45 MIMCO sounds like a really super rich and wealthy oil company, you think? Or at least in this case a bottled water company?
7365 2018-02-15 04:23:33 Yes, that was a very good comparison.  The ingenuity that gave us the oil sands can be applied to renewables.  #sustainableAB
7366 2018-02-15 04:23:15 now i’m what, literally hundreds of years late? cause y’all ain’t wanna tell me about these castor oil products? bet.
7367 2018-02-15 04:23:13 LMAO—China is Pissing Themselves—Worrying that Trump Will rebalance our Trading! As Far as $OIL—The U.S. is NOW—The Energy Superpower—Because of Trump’s Pro-Growth Energy Policies!!!  OPEC-China-Irrelevant!!
7368 2018-02-15 04:22:56 Thanks for asking, Raybones. A 7-fold+ increase in tanker traffic has major killer whale impacts & upstream environmental impacts + spill risks. Expansion of the oil sands increases GHG emissions globally, and growing its footprint hugely impacts northern FN communities.
7369 2018-02-15 04:22:52 Which oil is that?
7370 2018-02-15 04:22:50 Larsson is a solid D-man. The problem with the Oil this season is collective, except for McDavid.
7371 2018-02-15 04:22:44 Most of Canada benefits from oil, directly and indirectly. What about all the raw sewage dumping into the ocean off BC, destroying the ocean floor for decades? You folks from BC with your hypocritical concern about waterways. #CleanUpYourShit
7372 2018-02-15 04:22:35 Well, if Alberta dilbit replaces heavy crude with a higher carbon-intensity then, yeah, that's how we protect the earth in the short-term while we're electrifying transportation and displacing oil with electricity.
7373 2018-02-15 04:22:26 Try products with Salicylic acid instead of at home peels. It’s  a beta hydroxy acid, great at attacking pimples. It is oil soluble & can penetrate into the pores. It encourages exfoliation of skin and unclogging of pores, but does not do well with cystic acne.
7374 2018-02-15 04:22:20 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
7375 2018-02-15 04:22:04 First, if I can clearly see the butter (as opposed to it being melted) in the pan with your food of choice, you didn’t preheat the pan well enough.

Second, stop cooking everything with butter and invest in olive oil.

7377 2018-02-15 04:21:57 Interesting how all of the major oil companies are in favor of carbon pricing in order to remain competitive globally, but conservatives ignore that.
7378 2018-02-15 04:21:49 Wow man #CalmDown We are talking about the safest way to transport oil in the world here. Let’s leave the name-calling for people that aren’t friends. Lastly, I consider the safety of our oceans to be a global concern, not a provincial one.
7379 2018-02-15 04:21:45 Ok y’all I’m bout to oil up & slip on something 
7380 2018-02-15 04:21:41 That's pretty good huh, Donald Trump pushes infrastructure improvement and PA. is proposing 25 cents gas increase to do it.Guess who has interests in gas/ oil/ fracking/etc. Trump is reaming  your Xxx!

7384 2018-02-15 04:20:17 Uh no just saying I wasn’t a pussy. I work in safety also. Tragedy is the reason we have most safety laws. Except you know that whole gun thing. A hotel burned down and the whole industry changed. Miners died whole industry changed. Oil fields same. Laws are based off tragedies
7385 2018-02-15 04:20:11 So, do tell me - what hospitals should we close? What schools? What seniors programs, and services for those who are disabled and have special needs? What roads should we just let fall apart? 
Come on - you think you have all the answers.

If the PCs loved oil so much, why did it take so long to twin 63? 
Years of lack of care thanks to PCs left us with a mess. They tried to save a dime, lied that everything was balanced, and now we are paying that price, by having to spend to catch up
7395 2018-02-15 04:18:20 Bet you and your followers love to drive vehicles filled with oil, gas, and made from many mined products. Or do you walk everywhere? #truth
7396 2018-02-15 04:18:16 I just had an idea that seems to be a spin on that–a cacio e pepe but with diced prosciutto butts and a handful of greens tossed into the black pepper infused olive oil with some garlic and into the pasta (does this make it an aglio e olio spin instead?). How’s about that? :D

7422 2018-02-15 04:12:33 You do realize that they are twinning an existing pipeline line right? And that the oil that will flow thru that pipeline line is already flow into BC on railroad lines and by tanker truck? Both methods of transport are risky and contribute huge amounts of carbon, rt?

7445 2018-02-15 04:08:14 Inflation estimates for the year are in the 1.7%-2.0% for core CPI and 2.1%-2.4% for CPI. Consider also the impact of the price of energy. Unless oil continues rising, that variable leads to diminishing CPI prints.

7490 2018-02-15 03:59:53 It's possible he feels chilled due to lacking essential fats (fish oil) & possibly iron. Avoid ferrous furmarate, but use ferrous gluconate instead
7491 2018-02-15 03:59:51 Compared to oil or natural gas? I can believe that, but I’d stick with what we have and not jump the gun on energy sources that could potentially do more harm than good like nuclear fusion.
7492 2018-02-15 03:59:42 Obviously you know nothing of the wood buffalo region, Syncrude alone has reclaimed 4000 hectares, and 100% of the oil sands must be reclaimed, but don’t let facts get in the way of your rhetoric!
7493 2018-02-15 03:59:41 $6.2 billion for energy jobs through the carbon tax program. Another $3.4 billion for rebates. Farms are exempt and large emitters like oil sands are exempt.
$35 billion in infrastructure jobs over next 5 years underway. Creating jobs we asked for and need.
7494 2018-02-15 03:59:15 And fish oil yuck
7495 2018-02-15 03:59:12 @OlaySkin My mom only used this, and now I do, are there coupons available for this. Why spend all that money on a department store moisturizer when Oil of Olay is the absolute truth 
7496 2018-02-15 03:59:01 I think anyone who takes contributions from the NRA (gun makers), Pharmaceutical companies, oil companies and insurance companies should not hold a political position. They are suppose to be in office for the people not the companies.

7498 2018-02-15 03:58:50 THHE shareholders give approval to the proposed novation agreement with Yinson Holdings for the FPSO contract awarded by JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration (Malaysia) Ltd: Chairman DS Johan Abdullah
7499 2018-02-15 03:58:46 I’ve ate a million cucumbers, I’ve drank castor oil now I need to eat 7 pineapples
7500 2018-02-15 03:58:28 So your infantile brain not strong enough to stretch to know people own more than one oil bloc? Go and suck on your mom's breast for some more milk to grow enough brain!
7501 2018-02-15 03:58:14 自分でやったのはゲームボーイアドバンスのなんだけどね；ゲーム実況でいくつか見てる！乙女ゲームはつっこみどころ多くて笑う
7502 2018-02-15 03:57:40 Shiv Sena Chief #UddhavThackeray to today meet CM #DevendraFadnavis with delegation of locals from Ratnagiri district who are opposing an upcoming oil refinery in the area #Maharashtra
7503 2018-02-15 03:57:37 I betcha Trump told Saudis we won’t do anything if you manipulate oil prices helping his Russian friends.
7504 2018-02-15 03:57:20 Cut them about 1/4" thick, shook in a bag with a little olive oil & seasonings. 15 minutes in the air fryer, opened & shook the basket 3 or 4 times throughout. Tasty!
7505 2018-02-15 03:57:18 あ、昼飯に買ったやつだ。
7506 2018-02-15 03:57:18 There have been so many essential oil companies out there that I kinda wanna see a battle of the oils to prove which brand is better  #seriouslytheyareeverywhere
7507 2018-02-15 03:57:17 yesss, I was actually planning on switching to an oil remover. ty 
7508 2018-02-15 03:57:07 all i wanted was truffle gnocchi from Vega  but laying in my robe with  oil in my hair works too
7509 2018-02-15 03:56:49 Come to Kenya and pick your High Commissioner Nic Hailey who is subverting democracy and the rule of law because of oil in Turkana. We no longer trust Western countries. Period!
7510 2018-02-15 03:56:39 Hmm well not bad overall but you might want to consult pubmed on that “pour on the oil advice”. PUFAs are bad news—readily oxidized and high in omega 6s. Sometimes even hydrogenated is trans fat. Olive/avocado oil and natural saturated fats are much healthier!
7511 2018-02-15 03:56:21 Being against sport hunting or hunting endangered species is not necessarily incompatible w/ eating domesticated animals.

But re your point, collecting far too few royalties on oil, never having sales tax in #Alberta, has meant underinvestment in it & few value-added industries.
7512 2018-02-15 03:56:21 Probably going to do another two coats with bacon fat, just to make it smell yummy. The flaxseed oil has a faint but not pleasant odor even after curing.
7513 2018-02-15 03:56:10 use baby oil to remove your eye makeup!

7516 2018-02-15 03:55:27 hey are you a country with oil reserves and a newly-elected leftist government? 

coz I'd really like to instigate a coup and install a leader favorable to my interests
7517 2018-02-15 03:55:23 My hair looks amazing and I've done nothing to it but take it out of the loc sock. Coconut oil is a gift from God.
7518 2018-02-15 03:55:06 Strategy is important. Ypg pkk pesmerge forces will be wiped out by Turks Persians Arabs it is obvious. In order to avoid this usa Israel France may start an invasion to Syria Iraq. To invade Arabic lands for oil gas ans Israel Zionists they are. You do jot know you will see.
7519 2018-02-15 03:55:04 Roz, you should've asked him to wash and oil his cycle yesterday. It rains the next day, everytime.
7520 2018-02-15 03:54:13 Everyone on SNET/CBC. Give me Cuthbert, Miller, Beyak, D.Brown. Really like Mark Lee who's doing this broadcast. Could be biased because he called the Oil/Wings series in 2006 though.

7522 2018-02-15 03:53:48 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
7523 2018-02-15 03:53:44 Has anyone used or heard of using hemp seed oil or hemp seed in any way with their horses? My barn owner brought it up I just wanted some outside info before we try it with Elliot
7524 2018-02-15 03:53:24 Shadow money. NRA, Big Pharma, Oil and Gas lobbyists, finance/credit just to name a few. A good place to start? End citizens united and stop letting huge campaign donations elect government, pimp out congress and murder our children 
7525 2018-02-15 03:53:17 still available simple cleansing oil?
7526 2018-02-15 03:53:10 Yes this is necessary with oil prices rising and  inflation showing it's fangs
7527 2018-02-15 03:53:04 ちょっとアイコン変えて絵描きっぽくなったのでは？？？？？？
7528 2018-02-15 03:53:02 My pillow wipes off the oil. I tried jbco

7530 2018-02-15 03:52:54 What for, Iran produce oil and have serious wealth which they squander easily. This money should have been used to help Canadians that need it , create jobs, promote local industry, and look after indigenous problems.
7531 2018-02-15 03:52:52 Try olive oil on the ends of your hair. My daughter's hair is constantly dry at the ends, and it works like a charm (especially during these crazy winters we've been having!)

7536 2018-02-15 03:52:11 Oil of Olay
7537 2018-02-15 03:52:04 Actually tea tree oil is great for body & hair!
7538 2018-02-15 03:51:39 After Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, etc I'm sure we are all out of humanitarian heroism. What's that you say? There is oil under Gaza, United States to the rescue!
7539 2018-02-15 03:51:31 เรากำลังทำอะไรอยู่ตรงนี้ 
7540 2018-02-15 03:51:19 Coba beli essential oil di @ajenglembayung deh, Lu. Aku Alhamdulillah udah lama gak kena flu karna tiap berasa mau pilek langsung ku olesin oilnya. Juara.
7541 2018-02-15 03:51:14 It’s an oil based cleanser but it still works for my skin which is already on the more oily side. I will say that when I first started using it I did go through a phase where I was breaking out because of all the dirt it was bringing out but it only lasted a week or two
7542 2018-02-15 03:51:10 the key word is oil oil oil
7543 2018-02-15 03:51:01 @thataylaa I just watched your newest video & you said that you get dandruff. I have the same problem b/c my hair is dry! What I do is put coconut oil on my hair so Saturdays for 3 hours, shampoo it out and then condition.
7544 2018-02-15 03:50:56 #Food is the new oil. Supporting the agri food sector is key to Canada’s future. #FingersCrossed
7545 2018-02-15 03:50:49 I ran out of mositurizer one day and started using coconut oil. It's so greasy but I'm so dry (harsh Canadian winters) that I absorb it in a sec. But having same dryness issues with my hair. What to take care of??
7546 2018-02-15 03:50:35 ほんと無理せず。。。辛くなったら所構わず助けを求めてくださいね
7547 2018-02-15 03:50:22 Still no question the reason for the tariff is to support big oil who are major contributors to #Republicanism in its most vile forms
7548 2018-02-15 03:50:19 Knox and Defense is like oil and water
7549 2018-02-15 03:50:03 Your ignorance is astounding. You seem to be one of those that even when proven beyond a shadow of a doubt still deny it. Notley is anti oil, anti business, anti self reliance. She is all about her agenda not what’s good for Alberta or albertans.
7550 2018-02-15 03:49:44 "also known as Chinese oil stick" I want to eat five hundred
7551 2018-02-15 03:49:06 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
7552 2018-02-15 03:48:48 So a friend of mine tells me her Energy Efficient” Prius will now require an oil change every 1,00 miles. It’s a 2011 model. Is this shit for real?!!?
7553 2018-02-15 03:48:45 I’m on the Oil

7557 2018-02-15 03:48:15 Great Job earlier. I was wondering, do you know how much in donations @SenCapito has taken from oil and especially the NRA gun lobby?
7558 2018-02-15 03:48:09 So he can give his oil pals another handout?
7559 2018-02-15 03:48:06 I just poured a 4 that's an oil spill

7569 2018-02-15 03:46:11 Coal mining & drilling for oil should be a thing of the past, we have clean technology at our fingertips & need to utilize it! Should have been implemented years ago.

Only destroy peace.
7571 2018-02-15 03:45:58 Bc has bitched about Alta oil for years supports punishing us and now is mad because we may not let them run a pipeline Into Alberta. Is it different when the shoe is on the other foot? Bc had better make a deal with notley. Because they won't like Kenny.
7572 2018-02-15 03:45:50 My dad changed my oil, put air on all my tires, got me new tags cause they expired, put gas, and deep cleaned my whole car inside and out. That man has my whole heart. 
7573 2018-02-15 03:45:13  girl I know an oil for that!!! It got mine back

7579 2018-02-15 03:44:56 @JustinTrudeau has always wanted to kill every pipeline as a means of slowly strangling the oil indudtry in AB to death. He just wants the blame to land on someone else’s desk. Again we reach a point where the west would be better off without Canada #cdnpoli
7580 2018-02-15 03:44:50 ...About the return being to low saying oil should have gotten guys who are top 15 nhl d men and say oil got hosed for not getting one. Hall top 30 ish means return should be top 30 ish d man. I dont think 6 is far off that if at all. Appreciate the great discussion tho. Thanks!
7581 2018-02-15 03:44:42 What do you think you’re doing caving to KM? @RachelNotley and @JustinTrudeau  The jobs trade-off is significantly negative (50 vs 50K?). The impacts accelerate climate change. Both of you are paying nothing but lip service to Paris agmt while cozying up to Big Oil- SHAME!

7590 2018-02-15 03:43:11 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?
7591 2018-02-15 03:43:07 No, that's an oil rig. LA is a place people go, then get stuck in because it's so expensive just to live there, there is no possiblity of escape.
7592 2018-02-15 03:43:07 Ted in all seriousness... please drunk drive head on into an oil train
7593 2018-02-15 03:42:59 And...   so....  knowing what Asange knew at that time, he knew Hillary was an evil satanic entity seeking one world order and population control..  killing off our children and elderly through big pharma and vying for control of worlds oil
7594 2018-02-15 03:42:48 It's easier for most to just take fish oil pills, but eating actual fish is great as well.
7595 2018-02-15 03:42:36 คนสนใจเยอะน่ะ ตัวเองลงราคาเลยค่ะ
7596 2018-02-15 03:42:36 Then the gummies should help. Just keep in mind, what works for me may not work for you... If you don't see a huge decrease on your anxiety, I would try a different form of it like oil, or vaping it. :)
7597 2018-02-15 03:42:09 List could be to large. And yes 4 can drive a line offensively. Off the rush he's incredible. Struggles a bit off the cycle and in a heavy game..... My point is this. Hall is outstanding. But he's not a top 15 nhl forward. He's probably top 30 ish. Most people in yeg talk ....
7598 2018-02-15 03:42:02 Still crazy how #FredoSantana died from sippin lean.....most niggaz get to da point to where dey gotta stop but not Die fam 

Only other person I kno to die from oil was Big Moe
7599 2018-02-15 03:41:54 But there is no compromise when one side isn’t interested. That’s why we as a society need to treat candidates who take money from the NRA like we treat money from tobacco companies. Don’t vote for them
7600 2018-02-15 03:41:47 Not surprising. We’d do same. The real issue is the foundation of this new agency is to delay and approve very little thereby choking investment in oil sands and other resource sectors to kill it. Liberal plan all along.
7601 2018-02-15 03:41:32 You sound like a snake oil salesman.
7602 2018-02-15 03:41:24 I'm using the argan oil one now and I prefer it to the olive oil cause it has the strong hold without the annoying flakes. The coconut oil one great for curly styles tho.
7603 2018-02-15 03:41:19 Yes. But, you aren’t blessed with dark olive oil basted skin like some of us.
7604 2018-02-15 03:41:10 Tells me permit holders are law abiding.

7609 2018-02-15 03:40:16 All you have to do is provide contradictory evidence you can’t. All you have to do is look at the legislation these people are brining in. All anti oil. Common sense says they are against it. But keep sleeping.
7610 2018-02-15 03:40:16 Thanks guys that’s super helpful!! I’ll try the oil!

7616 2018-02-15 03:39:54 That’s not enough. Taking large donations from corporations &  industry organizations should be ended as well. Taking money from oil companies, NRA, Big Pharma & other such groups undermines our Democracy and faith in elected leaders who are seen as beholden to big & contributors
7617 2018-02-15 03:39:53 Yea they are. My first fitch. Ever since i started using all these @Staalmeester brushes they have improved the finish in my oil work. Its alot smoother now. I never used any brushes of these types. Really unique ya know. All i use now for my oil work.

7621 2018-02-15 03:39:29 Almost as if an oil tycoon running an environmental agency is bullshit and everyone knows it or something.

7625 2018-02-15 03:38:38 Doesnt mention ANY of those 1.9 million permit holders committing a crime.
7626 2018-02-15 03:38:32 Lets hope #oil prices gets reduced in #India now.

-almond-meal savoury loaf! LOVE grain free!
7629 2018-02-15 03:37:28 Yall should remember that climate change is a fake theory and conspiracy driven by corrupt scientists and governments exposed by a plucky band of magnanimous billionaires and oil magnates.

7632 2018-02-15 03:37:09 Well you can enlist in the military at 18, so I would think that would be an appropriate age for gun ownership, so long as you pass strict background and mental health checks and a difficult training class.

7635 2018-02-15 03:36:33 You have a very beautiful state

Wonderful to have visited; besides business

7637 2018-02-15 03:36:29 I put a pic of oil all over the parking lot on snap earlier (cause it’s all rainbow & shit) with the caption “kinda pretty. kinda gross.” And I meant to put “like me” & forgot and I feel like it was a good one wasted. 
7638 2018-02-15 03:36:26 It’s very pretty! I love contemporary oil paintings.

7781 2018-02-15 03:17:23 The Oil Kings' Fix-Wolansky knots the game 1-1 with a deflection at the side of the net.
7782 2018-02-15 03:16:57 Mike do you use high mileage oil
7783 2018-02-15 03:16:55 I keep it simple....good flour, olive oil flavoured with garlic, yeast, salt, black pepper and sunflower seed mix. Sometimes I add chopped olives. I make one batch, keep it in the fridge and make small flat breads on a very hot flat cast iron plate on the stove.

7792 2018-02-15 03:14:35 And I agree with you policy needs to change. We are agreeing for the most part buddy. Just don't think it's that simple to solve the mass tragedy problem. Nikolas Cruz was a tortured individual. We need better ways to identify that before they have the opportunity to harm at all.

7797 2018-02-15 03:13:45 It's a full plant extract from de-carbed material using 190 proof everclear. The tar-like oils can be infused into topicals, edibles, capsules, suppositories, etc. Blends really well into coconut oil, which has benefits for your kidney on it's own.

7826 2018-02-15 03:09:44 I bought an infuser water bottle earlier so I went to Kroger to get a cucumber. I was getting a few weird looks before I realized it’s Valentine’s Day. So I panicked and bought a few other fruits and some cooking oil. I don’t think the oil helped. So that’s my night.

7831 2018-02-15 03:08:38 Your post was about GOP women and climate. Additional oil drilling doesn't help climate, it makes it worse. And the tax bill is an abomination, taking money from less well off people and giving it to people with lots of money. Both are public policy disasters.

7852 2018-02-15 03:05:09 Wictor I have a question regarding Woolsey. What do you think about his working with J. Rothschild, Larry Summers, Dick Cheney, and Rupert Murdoch at Genie Oil?
7853 2018-02-15 03:05:02 I mean even assuming "export credit" as donations, or to see how much of those "loans & investments" are going to materialize, and actually why Iraq even needs any loans when they have so much oil. Iran's plan to increase oil & gas production is a much better plan for Iraq.
7854 2018-02-15 03:05:00 I don't think so either, but unfortunately I don't think it's quite that simple. Wish it was, that would be great.
7855 2018-02-15 03:04:55 This is so awful. It beats my mind how just any random person who can't even drink can just buy a gun whenever and wherever he (gendered intentionally) wants. The politicians really need to get out of the gun/oil/tobacco pockets, I guess?

7861 2018-02-15 03:03:43 In reality a gas tax is a good thing for the nation and the environment. Nothing will curb our oil dependence like paying to much at the pump. A little pain now for long term reward. Doubt trump is thinking that strategic though.

7872 2018-02-15 03:02:36 I’m old enough to remember when energy companies loudly whine about drops in gas consumption affecting oil price per barrel. Guessing they’ll be right on board with this smart idea.
7873 2018-02-15 03:02:09 that's because of world wide oil price hike. current price? effect of train law for the past 3 weeks. no world wide oil price hike yet, just wait for it. and we have train law 2 and 3 coming.
7874 2018-02-15 03:02:06 I have some extra for you of course. I’ve been drinking coffee my entire life lol. I did switch up my coffee habits a bit though, I start my day with “bulletproof coffee” now, it’s coffee blended with coconut oil and grass fed butter,sounds weird but turns out similar to a latte
7875 2018-02-15 03:02:06 #petrolprice Crude has fallen about 10% in the month of February, but petrol prices have not fallen by even a rupee a litre.... When crude goes up petrol price goes up daily.. isn’t it a cartel by oil PSU’s?? Will competition commission look into this??

7878 2018-02-15 03:01:36 To be fair, he’s flying the class of those he serves—barons of oil, coal, and natural gas, whose children don’t get asthma or grow up without fathers because of a collapsed mine.
7879 2018-02-15 03:01:32 You know you’re desperate when you throw aside the moisturizer and just smear coconut oil on your face instead #SoDry
7880 2018-02-15 03:01:21 I agree with that. I'm sure he didn't get his guns legally. There should have been some action by someone whether it was the school, law enforcement etc. rather than just kicking him to the curb. Especially with the Instagram posts. So sad.

7894 2018-02-15 02:59:39 Did you know there are 8 times as many murders by handguns than rifles in this country. If ARs weren't available he would have done as much damage as possible with a handgun. If guns were  gone he would have used fertilizer and fuel oil!

7898 2018-02-15 02:58:41 Again, only if you look at oil as fungible.  Look at US imports of heavy crude.

7901 2018-02-15 02:57:33 For the record I don't own a gun and never will. Just wish people would have deeper rooted conversations than we have now.
7902 2018-02-15 02:57:31 Growing up I had a friend who ran dirt late models and always used a open trailer. Why you ask? Because the big guys hate to lose to someone who had a open trailer. This is how I look at you and what you do. Keep it up and best of luck this season.
7903 2018-02-15 02:57:15 I fear that our true motivation is about oil and our own flailing economy about the failure to destroy Al Qaeda and about revenge.

7914 2018-02-15 02:56:06 Sure, as long as law-abiding citizens don't lose their rights absolutely. Stringent background and mental health checks, absolutely. But that's only part of the problem. It's not human nature to want to harm as much as Nikolas Cruz did, it's just not.
7915 2018-02-15 02:55:57 Burning the Midnight Oil + Psycho playing in background + 7 bottles of Cherry Coke = #ValentinesDay2018
7916 2018-02-15 02:55:50 Must be there coconut oil
7917 2018-02-15 02:55:39 that's funny. do you actually leave the tub+house without clothes? #5
wound care--how often is it fungal? diabetic ulcers. MCT oil-
BAKING SODA-the essential oils?-AF diet?....options. (pharma no likey?)
7918 2018-02-15 02:55:21 I like the oil and in no way like what has happened this year. But I’m only goin to point this out once. I told you the leafs were a much better team in September. And you argued with me. I hope Edmonton can turn things around but I’m glad the flaws are shown so they can improve.
7919 2018-02-15 02:55:15 Nationalism to sell oil, what a novel concept!
7920 2018-02-15 02:55:03 America preaches ideals it doesn't practice. Will go to war for oil but not over the subversion of it's democracy.
7921 2018-02-15 02:54:54 If Venezuelan owned Citgo is a U.S. oil company then what would a Russian owned Citgo be?   Btw did you forget about Uranium One?
7922 2018-02-15 02:54:49 距離...( ´:ω:` )
7923 2018-02-15 02:54:38 Agree that possibly will help. But you don't think that we should do more for troubled kids like this guy to keep them from harming themselves or others? Limiting weapons is something, but doesn't get to the root problem.
7924 2018-02-15 02:54:35 I wonder how many broken hearts there are in Oil Country today now that Draisaitl is off the market  So happy for him!!
7925 2018-02-15 02:54:19 Because @SenateMajLdr’s family uses too much oil in their shipping business.
7926 2018-02-15 02:54:17 For me, I see that all the virgins are eager for the Bridegroom. And the foolish lack extra flasks of oil, so their lamps start to go out around midnight. Why do you think the foolish virgins don’t have enough oil to last all night?
7927 2018-02-15 02:54:06 Don't fall for the snake oil salesman who run around and tell you that we can legislate ourselves out of this problem especially if they're thinking of running for higher office.

7929 2018-02-15 02:53:59 Raise the gas tax and get an Electric Vehicle . EVs are required to purchase an Alternative Fuel decal every year, the fee goes into the State Road & Bridge Fund. EVs are fun to drive, hi-tech and require no maintenance. No gas and no oil required
7930 2018-02-15 02:53:52 So many untapped opportunities in renewable energy, unfortunately all we after is oil and gas. May this oil and gas dry up.
7931 2018-02-15 02:53:42 Oil the good

7932 2018-02-15 02:53:28 I am travelling to Mumbai by Pune-Mumbai Pragati express in A.c. Chair car C2, seat number 23. The pushback of seat is not working and very uncomfortable to sit, also the breakfast table had oil spilt on it. This is pathetic service @PiyushGoyalOffc @PiyushGoyal @RailMinIndia
7933 2018-02-15 02:53:14 That was a beautiful punch! Need an oil painting of that
7934 2018-02-15 02:53:08 How about we try improving the gun laws and see if that works?
7935 2018-02-15 02:53:03 Yeah they were just showing which additive makes the best thing to coat and for flavor so it tastes like chocolate vegetable oil won then coconut oil
7936 2018-02-15 02:52:49 We steal oil and gold from Africa, send our troops to defend our freedom and democracy yet we can’t even protect our kids in schools where they should be learning not diving from bullets tomorrow another shooting another family suffers while these elected officials get rich 
7937 2018-02-15 02:52:43 You mean the hair care ones? I shop for my olive oil in the grocery aisle and pick the one that says it's good for cooking.
7938 2018-02-15 02:52:42 This is a lazy lie the ammosexuals have convinced way too many people makes sense. Stop making it so damn easy to kill people, and fewer people will do it.

7941 2018-02-15 02:52:27 I got some CBD oil to help with pain after an injury. It tastes like mint mixed with bong water. (Disclaimer: I have never actually tasted bong water. I am going by smell for this evaluation)
7942 2018-02-15 02:52:20 The irony in this statement is that for decades AB screamed its ‘our’ oil, ‘our’ oil and let the rest of Canada ‘freeze in the dark.’ Remember that one? Many of us do. #cndpoli @jkenney @CPC_HQ @Alberta_UCP
7943 2018-02-15 02:52:00 No matter if you are in church or in school this will happen until his return. Just cause your in church does not mean anything. Christianity in the whole was built on the blood of men  the  Apostols were burned in oil,  Crucified upside down  Beheaded all for the Gospel of truth
7944 2018-02-15 02:51:56 Nope USA engaged in an oil embargo & Economic blockade against Japan from June 1941, just like the US is doing now with #NorthKorea I am sure you know the ending because we've all seen this dumbass show before?
7945 2018-02-15 02:51:52 I get there's construction around downtown Orlando, but whoever closed the 408 interchange at 9:30 on the night of a magic game and created the traffic patterns needs to be dipped in boiling oil.
7946 2018-02-15 02:51:22 Also US dollar dropping. Oil is also is the time of year it rises.

7948 2018-02-15 02:51:10 Dear Americans,
Do you not realize that mostly your Republican reps. Do not care for your safety, health care, education, environment, roads, bridges,air, water, social security, Medicare, Medicaid ,Mental health services, addiction, etc,etc..... Trump is a snake oil salesman.
7949 2018-02-15 02:51:02 As a Canadian, voter and taxpayer, one of my chief concerns is the health of the planet. From the Canary Islands to Germany, renewable energy possibilities are being treated with seriousness and urgency. Economy and environment must be symbiotic. No more oil.

7959 2018-02-15 02:49:33 Try oil of oregano and garlic pills. Super potent. Works for me.
7960 2018-02-15 02:49:31 Coconut oil and scrubs with caffeine in them!
7961 2018-02-15 02:49:27 Oh piffle!  Compare a chart of the Loonie with a chart of West Texas Intermediate crude oil.  Look at both long and short term charts.  Although the correlation isn't 1.0 you can broadly say, as crude goes, so goes the Loonie.

The U.S. will bever ban guns just like they will never reduce oil production or consumption. Not about saving lives. About $$$

Regulate them out of business
7980 2018-02-15 02:47:08 Oleia Topical Oil helps relieve muscle pain, back pain, joint pain. Swelling is controlled, pain is relieved and flexibility restored.

7982 2018-02-15 02:46:39 Oh @kellierasberry ... At least you used the right soy sauce. Kikkoman is tops. 1/2 a bottle though? Naw. The next time try a 2 tbs of the soy sauce and 4 Tblsp of Hoisin sauce....and yes... oil is important. I recommend sesame oil. Maybe a dash of rice vinegar too.
7983 2018-02-15 02:46:30 Lots of avocado, olive oil, butter, and bacon..
7984 2018-02-15 02:46:21 Can’t call it “milk” if it’s made from hydrogenated palm oil.

7989 2018-02-15 02:46:00 For dry skin it's good and less expensive to use coconut oil. Just let it soak in before putting on clothes. I put it on my feet every night then wear socks to bed.  My feet are very soft in the morning.
7990 2018-02-15 02:45:47 I just grow it. I might  do more this year. I buy the essential oil and use that externally, but I just really enjoy the plant from spring to first frost. Great for bees & butterflies, too.

Corporate tax cuts, massive land grabs, offshore oil drilling, gas tax hikes

7993 2018-02-15 02:45:34 Stop with these propaganda tweets, they’re everywhere. Respect the rules of confederation? You’re kidding me right, your provincial government sure is respecting the rules of Canadian confederation by punishing BC’s wine industry while representing a Texas oil company. #alberduh

7995 2018-02-15 02:45:19 your MCM posts on snap talkin bout “At the shop again... ” and all he doing is getting an oil change 
7996 2018-02-15 02:45:13 While the GOP will the party of oil drillers, coal miners, and casino magnates.  What’s the difference?
7997 2018-02-15 02:45:06 sesame oil
7998 2018-02-15 02:44:38 It is the wildest thing that just 3 drops of oil in my ear can make me so dizzy
7999 2018-02-15 02:44:34 my morning face can supply enough oil to fry an egg for breakfast
8000 2018-02-15 02:44:31 Give the other 50% of profits coming from each new state that legalizes weed to the owners of Big Oil. Everyone wins. Billions get paid out to the right people. Sure the government gets a little shafted but how much money you need from an industry you're still not sure about.
8001 2018-02-15 02:44:23 Take bath in boiling  oil irrespective of seasons.
8002 2018-02-15 02:44:22 I agree. My opinion is that one side of the aisle refuses to compromise. But maybe that will change. I’m praying for those discussions to happen, so I won’t need to pray for victims so often. Pleasure talking to you.

8064 2018-02-15 02:34:54 I can’t believe that #AlbertaOil actually took out a Twitter ad to lobby #bcpoli for their stupid pipeline. We don’t want it! Ban our wine and heck, we don’t care if you build a wall. Clean energy is the future and oil is not.
8065 2018-02-15 02:34:53 What did I do for Valentines Day?

Forgot it was Valentines Day and worked on my dads car all day and changed the oil on my car.

Cold Craftsman Tools.
Used Motor Oil.
Air Compressor Song.

8080 2018-02-15 02:33:22 Mr. President Trump, Thank you for helping us out up here on the severe problem we have had for years with locomotive engineers employed by BNSF driving freight & unit coal & oil trains thru Whatcom County, WA in the middle of the nite and abusing the citizens with their horns.
8081 2018-02-15 02:32:58 The worst part of all this gun dialogue is I can believe the vast majority of the country would absolutely want better gun control but the leaders take so much money from the NRA the money in the system is KILLING IT ON ALL SIDES. Lawyers, big pharma, oil companies,  etc #enough

8089 2018-02-15 02:32:13 And honestly, I think stricter gun regs would save way more lives in domestic violence and self harm situations, than in these mass tragedies.

You think the author of that article is completely impartial and just reporting facts? Ever hear of a once well-known term “yellow journalism?”

8100 2018-02-15 02:31:28 People are used to corporate welfare in Canada. Although the LPC does it with much more gusto, all govts have been suspiciously generous toward certain companies including Bombardier, Martin’s ships (which bring eastern oil) and SNC Lavalin. Always the Quebec angle.

8105 2018-02-15 02:31:06 I agree. I guess that's my problem, that every time this happens it becomes a right now issue. All the talking heads on social media seem to think that a few gun laws will stop all tragedies like this. There's a much bigger issue.

8111 2018-02-15 02:29:00 It just shows you where we ‘re headed as a species. Our future as it has been stated by many politicians plays second fiddle to a bunch of oil. A holes
8112 2018-02-15 02:28:53 Put tea tree oil on it also try soaking it with warm water and sea salt
8113 2018-02-15 02:28:49 Off top of my head.... Benn, kuch, tarasenko, geaudreau, Kane, kessel, marchand, voracek, ov. But wingers aren't a fair comparison. They are the least impactful (vs centers, goalies and d). So would need to say forwards overall. Then I could probably name 25-30 players easily

8122 2018-02-15 02:27:13 Parallel parked first go, first time. Felt like a real adult. Celebrated by moisturising with the coconut oil that has lived on my dash for the last week. Felt like less of an adult. Moved my car twenty minutes later and crashed into the side of my work. 

3/10 adulting.

You know Rachel, if you had just kept your campaign promise of d-i-v-e-r-s-i-f-i-n-g Alberta's economy you probably could have avoided this mess. Now you just make it worse. All while being a sellout and a schill for big oil. Call an election...I DARE you.
8124 2018-02-15 02:26:41 Everyone says bio oil but it didn't do shit for me - maybe tea tree oil?
8125 2018-02-15 02:25:52 Poor guy. He's bought and paid for by big oil. They should pick up the tab for this too.
8126 2018-02-15 02:25:52 In fairness this should have been done twenty years ago. As well as more than a couple of refinery 's in Canada. BUILD Pipelines in Canada not the US. Why do we get less for a barrel of oil? Are we the have not's of North America

8128 2018-02-15 02:24:56 Yes, this was probably 4 years ago. He was crying and I didnt even understand what I had done wrong. So there are “hot” oils they can literally burn the skin if not diluted properly in a carrier oil like coconut or jojoba. If using in a bath you can also dilute with milk.

8145 2018-02-15 02:22:02 It's not the big oil and local business owners faults, because they don't allow competitive businesses to their own to open. It's the immigrants who work in the fields, taking the jobs the locals refuse to work.
8146 2018-02-15 02:22:01 Mark 6:12 And they went out, and preached that men should repent.13 And they  cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were sick, and healed them.

Repeat six times.

8202 2018-02-15 02:14:44 We can’t bring back the salmon after they are destroyed by an oil spill at the mouth of the Fraser River.
8203 2018-02-15 02:14:35 Norway retains a very high percentage of oil revenues for its citizens and uses a lot of that to subsidize the development and use of alternative forms of energy that are more environmentally friendly. I have always been impressed by the co-existence of both.
8204 2018-02-15 02:14:23 The difference is in how many people he can kill. I agree you can’t *stop* killing. But wouldn’t it be an improvement if only 5 people died instead of 17? Still not “acceptable,” but at least the damage is somewhat mitigated.
8205 2018-02-15 02:14:01 Ever tried tea tree oil on it?
8206 2018-02-15 02:13:53 Lucas Oil Racing TV driven by Ricky Long climbs the sand pile for a distance of 241.491. #NFMS18
8207 2018-02-15 02:13:43 Ordered some more Black Seed oil. Can't be getting deathly sick around here.
8208 2018-02-15 02:13:40 We'll kick their butts if they have another tournament? Yes I agree~ *places a few things into the oil*

8210 2018-02-15 02:13:10 get Cara Mia frozen artichoke hearts. Onions+garlic sautee in olive oil first. add artichoke hearts. add arborio rice. stir on heat til it clicks. cup of pinot grigio stir till absorbed. ladle veg broth, stirring, until all cooked. add dill+ mozarella
8211 2018-02-15 02:13:06 @AlfredoJalifeR_ una de las Licitaciones de la reciente Ronda de Pemex la gana una Empresa Mexicana de nombre Sierra Oil curiosamente dos  de los Socios son Salinas de Gortari y Ricardo Anaya precandidato Presidencial por el Frente como la  ve Dr
8212 2018-02-15 02:12:31 How many more deaths before you want to have the conversation? I’m genuinely curious. 

We’re willing to talk about the need for military intervention when someone tries to cut off our access to oil, but the lives of innocent children aren’t that valuable?
8213 2018-02-15 02:12:14 The whole point is to step in the water, oil, grease, soy sauce, etc. 

Get it off the floor and on your sock, so someone doesn’t step in it.
8214 2018-02-15 02:12:05 Aww thank you! Lately i have trouble with frying stuff because the oil freaks me out but im learning lol #iHeartAwards #BestFanArmy #BTSARMY @BTS_twt

8217 2018-02-15 02:11:51 Got to get an oil change, head light replace, go Through inspection AND change my license.....

#Minuswell gone get it washed a d detailed too
8218 2018-02-15 02:11:50 Dayum!

Would you be so kind as to share that link about the flaxseed oil seasoning again?
8219 2018-02-15 02:11:43 Like I said, depends on the D you get back. As far as the likes of Weber and Suter, you don't trade Hall in deals for those guys unless you're inept at your job. Also, how many wingers do think are better than Hall?
8220 2018-02-15 02:11:43 You're welcome,I hope it helps! I found that Argan oil of Morocco specifically from Marc Anthony helped my hair and it also helped with styling without heat.
8221 2018-02-15 02:11:42 Calling local dispensaries for CBD oil for dogs. I feel like a druggie looking to score 
8222 2018-02-15 02:11:42 I just cannot understand the pipelines activists problem with developing our oil and gas industry so we can benefit economically as an entire country. Yet they have no problem with Saudia , Venezuela and other countries with unethical human rights selling oil to Canada.
8223 2018-02-15 02:11:32 My guard dog is passed out on magical #CBD oil and it doesn’t get better than that. Thanks @cannacanine! We should feature these guys @myhydrolife #cannabisculture #cuttingedge
8224 2018-02-15 02:11:29 On another thought, if oil is your concern. We rather have the US taking oil vs money over Russia and Cuba taking oil for free or military weapons that they use against the Venezuelan people..... I think you have some homework to do...
8225 2018-02-15 02:11:22 wow that tea tree oil diffusing is working wonders for my sinus congestion

8235 2018-02-15 02:09:50 Which kind of oil goo did you bake on?
8236 2018-02-15 02:09:42 どもです！
8237 2018-02-15 02:09:14 @MrsViolence, I as well am diagnosed with severe migraines and on disability and could be triggered by what you mentioned. What helps me is Maxalt, Excedrin Migraine, or Tylenol Aches and Pains. Also, Peppermint Oil helps, just rub a little bit on the temples of your forehead.
8238 2018-02-15 02:09:11 Tut tut... did I hurt your feelings? And here I thought you could make your argument about oil. Apparently to have failed. Epically. As for what I do... I'll not wait to you to attempt anything meaningful. 
8239 2018-02-15 02:08:56 Getting back into my nighttime skincare routine,oil cleansed,exfoliated,toned with witch hazel,used tea oil for spot treatment and Rosehip oil for moisture and skin balancing
8240 2018-02-15 02:08:53 It doesn't help when usa puts sanctions cuts the imports by 2/3 so usa and the there bed Buddies in Saudi Arabia can have 60 dollar oil.
8241 2018-02-15 02:08:50 I use proactive everyday but then I use cetaphil oil control face wash and I use a oil controlling moisturizer  nothin helps
8242 2018-02-15 02:08:44 — to.

And he was gonna tease her till she lost it.

“Babe, can you help me see if this side is bigger?” His pectorals bulged just inches from her, almost glistening in the light.

Jay hoped she didn’t find the empty bottle of baby oil later.
8243 2018-02-15 02:08:39 The thing I found that helps me the absolute most is vitamins daily! I take vitamin C, Magnesium, B12, and fish oil. I also have all natural mood and stress pills. The last two days have been a little tougher than most but it definitely has improved!
8244 2018-02-15 02:08:36 Shower baby oil bed
8245 2018-02-15 02:08:32 Exactly, and Canada is one of the lowest contributors. These articles attacking Canadian oil is just bullshit to shut down our industry so the U.S. can thrive. Protest in the Middle East, India, China, South America! Scared, me thinks!
8246 2018-02-15 02:08:31 @tk070707tk 誕生日おめでとう！！
8247 2018-02-15 02:08:22 That's why Trump okayed tariffs of 30% on imported solar panels--oil companies are getting nervous and upped their bribe money.
8248 2018-02-15 02:08:11 GET RID OF FLIES: Diffuse Peppermint or Lemongrass essential oil keeps flies at bay #healthcoach #essentialoils #healthtip #damntheflies
8249 2018-02-15 02:08:04 Because most teams don't have players capable of handling the role and those teams need to do it by committee and hope for the best. Which is what the Oilers do and why you don't give up an elite forward for a 2nd pairing guy. Those guys can be found.
8250 2018-02-15 02:07:52 The taste? Not sure. The presentation? Clearly non-native olive oil eater.
8251 2018-02-15 02:07:43 That just sounds like a lot of extra work to me. I just peel, slice, rinse and dry off, and into the oil they go.
8252 2018-02-15 02:07:17 vitamin e oil. you can buy the pills and cut them, squeeze the oil out.
8253 2018-02-15 02:07:07 This kid was going to find a way to kill people at some point, no matter how difficult it was for him to get an AR-15. There are deeper rooted issues in our country right now. Closed-mindedness, divisiveness, identity politics are abundant here, that trickles down to our youth.
8254 2018-02-15 02:07:06 Nagkalat ung oil pastel sa papel kk hahahahaha may pag blend pa kaseng nalalaman eh
8255 2018-02-15 02:06:31 Oh and he takes up my argument for his own. What a joke. You have exampled every logical fallacy in the book. You are a fake blowhard. Move to Idaho where you can hunt bears without any oil products. Oh wait... there was a nuclear facility there... and Hanford, Wa. Oh my...

8258 2018-02-15 02:06:07 You’re very welcome. I used peppermint oil without a carrier in the bath and burned my son soooooooo I figured I better learn something. #momoftheyear I’ve had success with the Lemon and lavender mixture and the fir has that “minty” smell like eucalyptus.
8259 2018-02-15 02:05:39 Do ppl still keep oil after they fry something? Is that still a thing or am I too old-fashioned??

8261 2018-02-15 02:05:18 Friend in some oil. Kinky.
8262 2018-02-15 02:05:16 Use a mattifying or oil controlling primer and setting spray and a good translucent powder, some good ones are : Maybelline fit me loose powders, Laura mercier translucent, coty airspun translucent powder
8263 2018-02-15 02:04:59 When BP was spilling millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico, none of you ignorant #NRAslaves were saying, think of the waterfowl. Its not the time to talk about oil spill prevention. If we make oil drilling safer they will take our gas away. Stupidity isnt an asset.
8264 2018-02-15 02:04:45 100% but to be perfectly honest, those same issues happen to kids all over the world and the only place we continually see this kind of result is in America.

8266 2018-02-15 02:04:39 So . My doc suggested that I drink castor oil ... so I just did .. my mom was like “and don’t gag..” so I was like ..”girl I done swallowed c...” and then I stopped ! Lol I’ve been getting her all day !
8267 2018-02-15 02:04:36 So all those names we said (burns pk Webber etc) plus guys like suter, karlsson etc are actually more like top ten. Taylor Hall, tho superb, is not a top 10 nhl forward. Thus can't expect a top 10 d man back straight across.
8268 2018-02-15 02:04:30 You will probably argue me on some but let's start with oversee location and killing of bin Laden. Energy policies to reduce US consumption of Middle East oil (various emission targets, safe natural gas drilling on US  soil).

8280 2018-02-15 02:02:53 nice, you ever try poaching tuna in olive oil?
8281 2018-02-15 02:02:52 That's not a challenge. You are a failed emotional drag on everyone but for your self. When you can't win an argument you punk up some emotional nonsense and rely on fear. Here comes the oil... get out of town... heaven forbid you have to deal with a challenge yourself.
8282 2018-02-15 02:02:51 You go in for a simple oil change and leave needing to fix a million car issues. I swear, every damn time.

8287 2018-02-15 02:02:07 Fair statement that you don't make the deal. Oil were in tough spot on d.... the whole definition of a number 1 day is skewed tho. A number one d is a d man who is top 30 in the league but most people only think of the same 10 or so players.

Is it true when you surrendered to America, they gave your lands wealth to the Saudis ? Now with all that oil money, they build a new country whilst yours remains the same ? .. have they taken your balls or are you just happy to try bring in tourists through twitter ?
8297 2018-02-15 02:00:11 Iwanna kno y dude was laughing so goddamn much while changing the oil in my car
8298 2018-02-15 02:00:00 or to make an oil painting that embodies "repulsiveness" so I'm gonna paint a few discontinued, bloodied IUDs
8299 2018-02-15 01:59:58 Serious question! How do you take the tea tree oil? Because I have some and am slightly dealing with the same sore throat issue.
8300 2018-02-15 01:59:45 People who oppose KM in BC don’t give a hoot about climate change. They worry about an oil spill causing an Exxon Valdez off Vancouver Island
8301 2018-02-15 01:59:24 its possible but very improbable. Listen, as an unarmed water-protector at standing rock, they deployed all kinds of technology to squash the resistance to a friggin oil pipeline. They literally drained our cell phone batteries with military grade tech.
8302 2018-02-15 01:59:23 I just synthesized banana oil In ochem lab .now I’m worried about what these food companies are feeding us
8303 2018-02-15 01:59:17 Since when did your government actually care about acting on Climate Change? Trudeau's arguments are specious, at best. Refine the oil in Canada, keep the jobs here, lessen our dependence on foreign oil.
8304 2018-02-15 01:59:17 IMO the officiating no matter whose games you are watching is just dreadful. There is absolutely no consistency.
8305 2018-02-15 01:59:13 If that kind of trade can't happen, you don't make the deal. That simple. Look elsewhere to address needs and visit it later...just like the Avs and Duchene.

8313 2018-02-15 01:57:48 I suspect @theJagmeetSingh and @NDP have something to do with this.  Liberal's Harper-style foreign policy was making them almost as vulnerable as their enthusiasim for pipelines and dirty oil
8314 2018-02-15 01:57:47 Add oil!
8315 2018-02-15 01:57:47 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong, and is cheaper than shop-bought manicure oils.

8317 2018-02-15 01:57:38 Depends. Subban's contract would've dictated a 1-for-1 kind of deal. Wouldn't have moved him at the time for Weber in any deal b/c of age. The other guys would've been Hall+ a little something else b/c of the value of top-flight D...though Burns is nowhere near the other three.

8336 2018-02-15 01:55:01 I need to get better at proteins but tonight I roasted potatoes/onions/garlic/parsley/paprika in olive oil (served with... a hard-cooked egg for protein.. because that's what I have in the house) and baked apple slices with vanilla/cinnamon/nutmeg for dessert with vanilla yogurt.

8340 2018-02-15 01:54:09 Yeah that's true. Too bad him and his big oil buddies don't really care about you. Pay attention
8341 2018-02-15 01:54:06 Me estoy dando cuenta que muchas chicas quieren pesar 40, ¿que onda con eso? ¿por que todas quieren pesar eso?

8343 2018-02-15 01:53:20 ผิดสิ รู้สึกผิดต่อเงินในบัญชี...
8344 2018-02-15 01:53:15 @RachelNotley bc block our oil, we should block their goods too, seems fair.
8345 2018-02-15 01:53:04 Exactly, keep that lantern lit and the oil flowing. Light as a feather
8346 2018-02-15 01:52:58 Whenever possible, make natural plant food and oil, multistrain probiotics, real exercise  and ethical learning, be your first medicine.
8347 2018-02-15 01:52:55 I also get emails when he needs an oil change. And from his alumni association. And everything else. Emails are fucking free, it makes me so angry. I messaged him on Fb & yelled at him once. He never responded.
8348 2018-02-15 01:52:27 Let the survivors boil the SOB in oil.....slowly!
8349 2018-02-15 01:52:25 Just because it's true doesn't mean it needed to be. Consider that it could have and should be different. We don't need or want more dirty energy money - keep it in Alberta with your dirty hard-to-refine crude oil. Maybe build a refinery for fuck sakes.
8350 2018-02-15 01:52:17 แต่โอตะไม่ผิดนะ
8351 2018-02-15 01:52:09 I ordered an essential oil vape so I’m officially at maximum douchebag
8352 2018-02-15 01:52:08 One more step closer to getting the S10 project running! Ordered my cam & kit, rings & bearings, oil pump and all to assemble the 355!!!!
8353 2018-02-15 01:51:56 The fact many weren't sure how good the Raptors would be heading into this season was understandable but how foolish do those experts feel that had them as a middling team in the East. Apparently, the past 4 seasons meant nothing 
8354 2018-02-15 01:51:55 You are a myopic dolt who's intellectually dishonest.The argument of gun control is false,no gun control would stop this nor would ownership argument as those who desire weapons will acquire it at all cost. Sell your snake oil somewhere else. Took 15 min to start anti gun rant!
8355 2018-02-15 01:51:50 Too late for some projects in the pipeline as e.g Kinder Morgan, Gulf St Lawrence oil exploration...
8356 2018-02-15 01:51:40 Like the people of Alaska own the oil? #akleg
8357 2018-02-15 01:51:37 They get all the guns they want BUT No Oil Drilling on their Shores!! 
If you are a tourist you should be safe. Just don't be a tax paying resident you could be shot on site!
8358 2018-02-15 01:51:35 I Personally won $1700.00 in 24 Hours with this Attraction Oil... I challenge anyone to do that with any other product!
8359 2018-02-15 01:51:06 Why is a public government spending my dollars on an ad for big oil?

Oh right, cause we're in a democracy and I'm totally influencing this to happen guyz and it's not cause oil = pay for play
8360 2018-02-15 01:50:36 Ive signed.. will you too plz? 
Palm Oil plantations for wealthy businessmen are destroying land in vast quantities & killing Orangoutangs.
8361 2018-02-15 01:50:29 Sir it's not crude oil but cruel oil

8365 2018-02-15 01:49:44 Goes to a1: “can I have vegetable hibachi, (making sure the noodles are not egg noodles) also can u cook everything with oil instead of butter, white rice instead of fried and miso soup instead of clear soup, also cucumber/avacado sushi. !”

8368 2018-02-15 01:49:03 Mans that like one tank of gas in my truck with 22 gal tank or maybe not since the oil companies made way more then that and then raise prices and profit margins

8371 2018-02-15 01:48:40 Who @ScottPruittOK created this toxic political environment? Who works for the oil and gas industry, selling off national monuments and parks to oil drillers?   Who cares more about his donors than the American taxpayer?
8372 2018-02-15 01:48:28 I wanna be rubbed down with some coconut oil
8373 2018-02-15 01:48:15 Sam got his fresh oil change and a full tank of gas in the morning, gotta make sure bae always on his shit ! 
8374 2018-02-15 01:47:57 The EU deemed Alberta Oil clean more then two years ago. Good enough for Spain Italy... etc. You violate Federal Law... and ignore the EU determination given the grade of the oil that the EU already receives by tanker. Enjoy your bubble of criminal ignorance...
8375 2018-02-15 01:47:52 Is there baby oil on the court??Ive never seen so much slipping and stumbling in my life during a bball game
8376 2018-02-15 01:47:45 Easiest way to repay the Koch Brothers who have a tremendous amount of oil to sell and with gas demand down and prices high.
8377 2018-02-15 01:47:22 Nicola Tesla had a better idea, where is that?! 
Oh yeah, we haven't run out of coal, oil, and natural gas yet...

8380 2018-02-15 01:47:11 In the UK North Sea, Shell was planning to sink an old oil platform and Green Peace understood that UK goverment would not do anything to stop it. Green Peace's strategy was to expose the problem to Germans who in turn pressured UK. Shell had to stop and unmounted the platform.
8381 2018-02-15 01:46:55 Don't care about global demand, not relevant at all... more Alberta oil is not going thru the BC coast. Social resistance will prevail. Common law will override Alberta's bullshit claim that they can tell BC what to do.
8382 2018-02-15 01:46:47 Be careful with eucalyptus oil...it can cause breathing problems in children under 10. I never had an issue when using topically with coconut oil on my children but I didn’t know about aromatherapy safety then either. They recommend Lemon, lavender or fir for little ones.
8383 2018-02-15 01:46:42 Great!! Something about the olive oil just tones it down a notch which I like.
8384 2018-02-15 01:46:24 The same way we sacrifice lives for pharma profits, eat and feed our kids GMO foods for corporate profits, invade and bomb countries for their oil and resources, why should this be any different?
8385 2018-02-15 01:46:21 He’s a great guy isn’t he? What a no good SOB and it’s all to sell snake oil to the credulous.
8386 2018-02-15 01:46:21 Change that oil.
8387 2018-02-15 01:46:19 Tu dia tulis oil reduction so i assume utk oily skin plus dia ada salicylic acid which is suitable utk oily skin. Tp kalau u try ok guna je la :)
8388 2018-02-15 01:46:16 “Yo are we playing naked twister?? I just got a new bottle of olive oil”
8389 2018-02-15 01:46:13 they dont think about all the jobs it creates or all the money the state makes from oil and gass
8390 2018-02-15 01:46:10 If Chias only target was 6 and he would have rather had him vs burns, pk etc then he really is one of the worst gms ever.... question: what do you actually think would have been fair return. Pk, doughty, burns, Webber, josi etc? Because I don't think Hall could get that return.
8391 2018-02-15 01:46:09 I don’t fit in with all these country oil field people
8392 2018-02-15 01:45:51 Taxing oil will incentivize renewables. Car owners should take on the cost of roads. It will incentivize people to buy @tesla and other electric cars. I'm shocked he would support this when he loves making out w oil execs
8393 2018-02-15 01:45:46 Still, US getting there...don't you think? Manouevring an oil tanker bound to be slower than a speed boat.
8394 2018-02-15 01:45:42 But I bet it leaves oil company subsidies alone

8411 2018-02-15 01:43:10 As the already too high price of oil and gas is increasing even more, our government is planning an additional 10% tax on gas. This coming after they increased the debt to give tax cuts to rich people and corporations. Our government is a joke. Both democrats and republicans.
8412 2018-02-15 01:42:55 Aint no standard oil man gonna run this state its gonna be run by little folks like me and you

8414 2018-02-15 01:42:47 Put 4 tablespoons of baby oil in your bath water. Your skin will be silky smooth in no time.
8415 2018-02-15 01:42:40 You seem to believe tar sands bitumen is the world’s only source of oil. It ain’t. In fact it’s the dirtiest, least economical, least efficient, most environmentally destructive source of energy next to coal. Costs more energy to process than it yields. Dump your tar addiction.

8418 2018-02-15 01:41:44 Why so many oil rich countries on the list, in fact why so many countries on the list, time to stop these payments which only goes to nurture the corruption culture and remember charity begins at home.
8419 2018-02-15 01:41:27 Oh no not break outs? Have U tried a brand that uses coconut oil in its formula...

8442 2018-02-15 01:38:16 Are oil royalty dividend payments by Alaska to residents "wealth redisribution plans"/"leftist tripe"?
Are the Clean Air markets for pollution permits also?
8443 2018-02-15 01:37:55 Please, explain it to me.
8444 2018-02-15 01:37:50 clean up your oil spill mess and tailing ponds and we may begin to believe you, till then leave our #bcpoli province alone and clean

8449 2018-02-15 01:36:26 It’s always good to believe your snake oil is the real snake oil.
8450 2018-02-15 01:36:19 Was it last month? What ever happened to all that oil we just imported from Russia? Who bought it? I can’t find anything on it. Am I going insane? @maddow @MuellerSheWrote @thememoryhole2
8451 2018-02-15 01:35:25 Did you ask if you slow or turn off tank 1 will it create any unnecessary heat or other issues. Was just thinking could you plumb it 3,2,1 so that your fastest motor gets oil first. Maybe no need but just a thought that comes to me
8452 2018-02-15 01:35:19 jock itch cream? tea tree oil?

8460 2018-02-15 01:32:58 My biggest fear: overcooking a good steak
Second fear: setting the oil in the cast iron skillet on fire. I did that once 15 yrs ago. No damage, but leaves a mental scar.

What's your fear?
8461 2018-02-15 01:32:55 Isn't Venezuela on your list next??
It's looking likely. They have oil. Isn't that the only requirement for regime change? Scotland has oil. Are we on the list? Or will UK change our regime??

It is a beautiful, moving piece for a man who felt so much

8471 2018-02-15 01:31:24 Alberta needs to be prepared to pay for the coming oil spills off the coast of BC.
8472 2018-02-15 01:31:24 Happening just South of our Border. Headless bodies not an unusual sight. Mass graves not uncommon.
8473 2018-02-15 01:31:22 Not so simple... don't shift the argument... you still use oil. Where you getting it? Some one elses' back yard? That's Nobel. Now go after those companies as a Canadian and quit being naive, a lawbreaker, and otherwise a contributor to the destruction of Canada's economy...
8474 2018-02-15 01:31:04 Being salvadorean and being concsious on what you eat is like oil and water
8475 2018-02-15 01:31:04 Black Oil Drop
8476 2018-02-15 01:30:59 Synthetic Oil in your truck?
Thoughts?
8477 2018-02-15 01:30:32 Its comforting just knowing you wanna oil my back. Imma sleep like a log w/ this knowledge, whereas I usually toss and turn wondering if that's something you'd be into.
8478 2018-02-15 01:30:30 OIL DIFF: 3.74 -> 3.83
8479 2018-02-15 01:30:07 On hand COLLAGEN HOT OIL.
8480 2018-02-15 01:30:05 It also opens our beautiful coast to oil spills and harm to our wildlife. Global trade is going to happen whether we're part of it or not. We need to be working on clean energy. That will lower energy imports and it won't harm the only planet we have. I'm sure you know that.
8481 2018-02-15 01:30:05 It's not enough to keep fluid levels topped off when you get your oil checked.
Periodically, you need to have the transmission serviced 
8482 2018-02-15 01:29:56 i want to get my car's oil changed on sunday
8483 2018-02-15 01:29:55 What your pickup per revolution on shaft sensors, its nice to have a high pickup so motors run smooth. Second ?, in your block pic is there any concern of second motor getting enough oil if first motor is going really slow. I can't remember how I setup but looks very similar
8484 2018-02-15 01:29:48 #ValentinesDay evening is a great time to get an oil change!
8485 2018-02-15 01:29:35 Quien no yo me conformo con uno del staff viste si me lo consiguió tae
8486 2018-02-15 01:29:33 @RandPaul Omega 3 oil suppresses immune system, so increasing it in our diet through supplementation is a terrible idea. Microbiome = Chronic Disease. Suppressing the immune system will do what?? Still stuck in 20th Century. $Trillions spent on no cure epidemic Chronic Disease.
8487 2018-02-15 01:28:53 Oil tycoons in the cabinet btw
8488 2018-02-15 01:28:47 it's any industry, if you don't have money you can't get their ear, it's big oil, big gun, big beer, big education.etc etc
8489 2018-02-15 01:28:37 When I get back from this tour I’m gonna take the best bath in a TON of coconut oil and then I’m gonna fine a playground and exercise the shit out of it.

Also laundry. Lots of laundry.
8490 2018-02-15 01:28:35 "All the way to where the olive oil goes" 
8491 2018-02-15 01:28:28 To actually answer the question: I can't go past whole flat brown / portobello mushrooms fried in butter or olive oil. Alone on toast or accompanying steak. Not fancy, but damn tasty!
8492 2018-02-15 01:28:07 gold is hard earned money, stocks are fast and loose like nate hooker and his vape pen. super dank Colorado green oil is worth ... 30 times drilled oil.  Do you see a slight paradigm shift in 2018? Weed is predicted to be 18 times market bigger than cigarettes. and sustainable
8493 2018-02-15 01:27:55 Made a new pasta dish I must rave about! Get some pesto (does not matter what brand) and spaghetti. Cook sauce with butter and then add cooked pasta. Mix around and add mozzarella. Add a little olive oil before plating. Plate and add some sriracha sauce.
8494 2018-02-15 01:27:48 Putting castor oil on my lashes and crossing my fingers
8495 2018-02-15 01:27:43 Hahahahaha welcome to the East Coast warmth. Hahahahaha.

8497 2018-02-15 01:27:14 Yep. Got it leveled up to +3 before the fight so it did some pretty good damage. And during the beginning I used an oil urn and the flamethrower for a moment.
8498 2018-02-15 01:27:11 I remember I met a girl who talked a good game but her shit ended up being dry asf I had to use baby oil An that ain’t even work
8499 2018-02-15 01:26:58 His agenda to kill the health of our planet in support of the oil, gas and other industries is surely worth a little personal disruption.  Just look at the suits he brought against EPA.  Face your accusers and fly coach like the rest of us!
8500 2018-02-15 01:26:47 Come up with a law that makes a criminal mind stop and think, yea I can't do that there is a law says I can't. Problem solved.
8501 2018-02-15 01:26:44 Why not tax the oil companies? They have the money for it. If I recall correctly they just got a tax cut.
8502 2018-02-15 01:26:21 My mom just hit my oil pen 
8503 2018-02-15 01:25:14 Britain and Nigeria government killed over 6 millions Biafra people 1967 to 1970 .because oil in Biafra land. Justice most be done
8504 2018-02-15 01:25:02 Hey Al! Tell us about how you used to be in the oil companies pockets.  Remember the '80s & '90s? That was funny. Huh?
8505 2018-02-15 01:24:42 Really didn’t think that royal purple oil worked but my truck smashed even more now 
8506 2018-02-15 01:24:21 Good thing Canada doesn't produce invisible oil.
8507 2018-02-15 01:24:20 @UPGovt  stockest ka pass bhari martra me mentha oil hone se kisan ko mentha ka sahi price nahi mil raha hai please oil ko export kerye jisase  up kisan ko acha pasa mil sake please kuch kero

8510 2018-02-15 01:23:15 “What did you do for Valentine’s Day?”
Me: My dad asked me to rub coconut oil on his chest
8511 2018-02-15 01:23:08 I doubt an underwater pipe could be shut off before spewing a tanker-ful of oil, even with support services available. After a major earthquake severs who knows  how many off shore pipelines we are in trouble.
8512 2018-02-15 01:22:55 Part 2 I’m having to use cannabis and hemp oil to stop seizures from withdrawals from these terrible medications... I’m a prisoner of our great nation...

8518 2018-02-15 01:21:55 Your buddy Sec Ross is partners with Putin in a Co. That transports oil!  You're all corrupt mercinaries we're gonna put in jail. You pledge alligence to the highest bidder and are contemptable. Zinke the stink!

8523 2018-02-15 01:21:20 They are NOT going to drill for oil off the Florida coast either.

8528 2018-02-15 01:20:22 Of course he has unpleasant interactions with the public.  He’s killing our planet in the name of corporate greed and the oil & gas industry.
8529 2018-02-15 01:20:18 ありがとうございます！
8530 2018-02-15 01:20:08 .... Which tells us nothing of the ownership of the oil. That shows geographical ownership, not resources. Maybe you should away and wise up?
8531 2018-02-15 01:20:04 Lavender oil ?
8532 2018-02-15 01:19:57 Something happening in Cuba..oil. who is to aquire the small island in between Cuba and Maiami..needs signature from President today
8533 2018-02-15 01:19:56 I hate having a late birthday because that means i can't apply to an oil change place, I know for a fact I would land a job there
8534 2018-02-15 01:19:54 The last nug ended up burning instantly and caused smoke clouds to go everywhere. Smoke detector works.  What remained of the last nug resembled steel wool. I forgot the fact that hot dogs have a high water content...add that to 400°F hot oil...not my best moment.
8535 2018-02-15 01:19:52 She dn rub her 2 legs together tire...jst to press d labia minora & labia majora with mild pressure, so dat oil rig no go burst
8536 2018-02-15 01:19:47 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.
8537 2018-02-15 01:19:47 そうなんですよねー。ただ最終的にズボラな旦那を選んだ人が悪いってなっちゃうんでしょうねー( ﾉД`)ｼｸｼｸ…
8538 2018-02-15 01:19:38 Tip: heat up a piece of charcoal on stove.After the chickens r done, put them in a pot. Place the burning charcoal in the chicken with aluminum foil under. Put some ghee/oil on the burning charcuterie. Cover for 10 min. Boom!

8542 2018-02-15 01:18:59 (#^-^)ﾒﾗ…ﾒﾗﾒﾗ…
8543 2018-02-15 01:18:44 @RealAlexJones  Watch at 8min section small islands off Cuba transporting oil from Cuba to Florida. Another small island in area Russia is looking at to transport oil but could also build military base.
8544 2018-02-15 01:18:40 That Zinke and oil CEO?
8545 2018-02-15 01:18:37 MINERAL RIGHTS& OIL,GAS RIGHTS IS A START TO SELF SUFFICIENCY.

8548 2018-02-15 01:17:53 How can people underestimate the power of prayer? Or better yet, think praying is a joke 
8549 2018-02-15 01:17:47 Three warm spoonfuls of oil a slice. I love pizza, but I also love not clogging my arteries...
8550 2018-02-15 01:17:38 First off, I tried deep frying them in a pot on the stove, and not with an actual deep fryer. Couldn't regulate the oil temp very well.

Second, the batter cooked before the nuggets inside even got warm. 

Third, I ran out of batter on the last nug and everything went wrong.
8551 2018-02-15 01:17:35 Last time my stomach got Really Sick I'd had smth with fresh olive oil and pine nuts and while I love them, my body just like... freaks out if I have them now ;_;

8553 2018-02-15 01:17:20 Almond oil is poppin.
8554 2018-02-15 01:17:09 Yeah. Oil is good for health 
8555 2018-02-15 01:16:44 Yes, I binged all of #QueerEye in two days. Yes, I cried. Yes, I bought beard oil. Next question.
8556 2018-02-15 01:16:21 それではいかんのだ…
8557 2018-02-15 01:16:08 So I'm baking some sweet potatoes & yams and it smells so good, I winder why nobody's made a yam candle lol. FYI: I'm gonna mash em up, add truvia, vanilla, coconut oil, & pumpkin pie spice. It tastes like pie filling & it's healthy, I highly recommend it!!
8558 2018-02-15 01:15:46 @realDonaldTrump   Watch at 8min section about islands off Cuba who will purchase? Oil is transported from Cuba to other small islands to Florida. Russia is interested in one of these small islands could build military base as well.
8559 2018-02-15 01:15:39 Standard Oil. They're just hoping the 3rd Century Romans could have a few days local is another 45.
8560 2018-02-15 01:15:22 coconut oil, works for everything LOL
8561 2018-02-15 01:14:54 Fuelling the oil industry, safe sailing.
8562 2018-02-15 01:14:53 It's what we are doing right now!  We burn ff to get electricity, converting that to hydrogen so that we can have "clean cars" is non-sensical... it would actually be cleaner to continue burning oil in IC engines.  Only FULL and ONLY electrical system makes sense, and will occur.
8563 2018-02-15 01:14:50 I’m my own Valentine. I got myself a car wash, oil change, shit from Ulta, and I’m about to get myself a pedicure.

8566 2018-02-15 01:13:49 Steak, loaded baked potatoes, salad, and some toasted French bread with oil and seasonings, washing it all down with wine. If I’m going to spend the night alone I’m at least going to eat good.
8567 2018-02-15 01:13:47 I see someone who had an itch after changing their oil
8568 2018-02-15 01:13:46 Yeah, I always take advice from people who’s response to something they don’t approve of is “it’s stupid”. Why don’t you educate all of us about the tens of thousands natural oil seeps out in the ocean and explain how those are OK.
8569 2018-02-15 01:13:40 No sane person can compare Haatuf & Sabri. This innocent journo was fired for telling the ugly truth. Haatuf's boss has been using his mediahouse to extort politcians and businessmen for years. He even used his power to attempt to extort a Minister for the rights to a oil block!
8570 2018-02-15 01:13:40 YOU HEAR THAT, AMERICA? THEY HAVE ALL THE OIL.
8571 2018-02-15 01:13:17 I'm pushing legislation which will see an oil derrick installed in the house of anyone who earns more than $100,000 a year

8574 2018-02-15 01:13:11 My husband said that when Tillerson was CEO of Exxon, he jacked up oil & gas prices so much, he was partially responsible for causing the recession in 2008. He is crooked, but I think he's the only 1 in 45's cabinet who is trying to do his job, but Trump always undercuts him.
8575 2018-02-15 01:12:53 Thrilled to welcome the @Lucas_Oil @NOW600Series to the RBN family! ST
8576 2018-02-15 01:12:49 We have excessive amounts of oil. It's why we're one of the richest countries in the world, even though we are oh so small. Which in turn is why our life quality is so high.
8577 2018-02-15 01:12:47 In desperation, I have now purchased citronella candles and citronella oil.
8578 2018-02-15 01:12:33 Hey. I beleive you mean a lot to the people around you. And yes maybe you have seen and done more than me. Maybe not. That doesn’t mean anything. But if you don’t sit around and watch cars crash that’s good. But are you going to ban the use of oil so that only the people who get
8579 2018-02-15 01:12:29 I don’t get the hype over tea tree oil it literally causes the darkest marks on my face after it dries the pimple out

8583 2018-02-15 01:11:26 Bored and sick, watched the Dark Crystal. Now got lavender essential oil + incense going... what to do now...
8584 2018-02-15 01:11:24 Wonder if Charlie tried any of that coconut oil, Harry?
8585 2018-02-15 01:11:16 Yesterday, Kellyanne Conway began drilling for oil in  three owl-flavoured toddlers, but you were too distracted by Trump's tweets to notice.
8586 2018-02-15 01:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: crispy crust with sweet motor oil and egg.

8588 2018-02-15 01:10:56 What's the best alternative energy choice to replace oil and it's byproducts?
8589 2018-02-15 01:10:54 Cotton seed produces oil used in a large proportion of cafe/takeaway shops for frying. So yes cotton is a food source.
8590 2018-02-15 01:10:46 Funny, if by exposing the votes in the low oil capital of Kaine supports TPP, NAFTA, high places-

8595 2018-02-15 01:10:27 Maybe we can refine the oil here too? Wouldn't that bring more jobs, cheaper fuel, and less transportation, ultimately all of our oil ends up being shipped via barges around the world to be refined, defeating the advantage having a pipeline anyways

8597 2018-02-15 01:10:16 It's so vital that no one outside Norway cares. Come back when you got a movie industry or oil, BITCH
8598 2018-02-15 01:10:13 Oil is a thing of the past lady...I suggest you get on another boat!

8601 2018-02-15 01:09:50 Every time you say Carter had livers, I smile.  The original saying is “ than Carter has liver pills”.  There was an otc pill called Carter’s little Liver Pills. For real. Think he was a snake oil salesman.
8602 2018-02-15 01:09:39 That Jojo should have rubbed some Tilden corn oil on that ankle and duct taped it up, Harry. This is a game against a conference opponent we are battling. Clemon Johnson never let a sore ankle stop him! #Sixers #Jojoworriedaboutallstarfestivities #SixersTalk
8603 2018-02-15 01:09:38 Orban can simply see the outrageous dangers of mass third world immigration, into a Christian majority first world country.

Oil and water don't mix.
8604 2018-02-15 01:09:36 No oil, I use silicone pad for baking. Everything still comes out crisp, maybe takes a little longer to cook
8605 2018-02-15 01:09:26 Has anyone tried coconut oil for baby acne? I’ve tried breastmilk and no luck! 
8606 2018-02-15 01:09:09 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
8607 2018-02-15 01:09:02 "There will be blood" is a movie which correctly defines current situation of America. It shows what the oil fortune can do to a normal person.
8608 2018-02-15 01:09:01 You actually just added oil:)
8609 2018-02-15 01:09:00 I feel like it's this weird mix of snake oil and people desperate for solutions to something, anything, combined with a handful of people who are legitimately capable of assessing it for what it is and cautious in their calls for application.
8610 2018-02-15 01:08:49 Why don’t you just send me the money?  I’ll put it to good use buying the first round of drinks for all oil price betters at the Four Seasons Houston during CERAWeek!
8611 2018-02-15 01:07:55 You cannot trust @DanielJHannan to tell the truth and look after the public interest in any shape or form.
He's the ultimate snake oil salesman, just like Rees-Mogg. And Redwood.
Their agenda is their personal wealth.

8756 2018-02-15 00:40:48 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
8757 2018-02-15 00:40:41 Isn’t that sad. I bet if 18 oil tankers had been hijacked in the Middle East shit would be handled. All you need is a few armed guards and better perimeter security at every school to deter these kinds of things.
8758 2018-02-15 00:40:22 え…エルザとは…別に…な…(ﾀﾞｯ
8759 2018-02-15 00:40:22 I would imagine the first asset class was real estate, followed by commodities  (corn, metals, oil etc), then equities  (stocks etc) and bonds. 
You can divide these down further but in general a new asset class is extremely rare and crypto & BTC is just that.

"Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it over Saul’s head. He kissed Saul and said, “I am doing this because the LORD has appointed you to be the ruler over Israel, his special possession.”

8761 2018-02-15 00:40:10 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
8762 2018-02-15 00:40:08 Why should BC be used as an oil spill pawn for Alberta’s 2nd world economic ideas?  What benefits are there for BC?  Only risks with no reward for BC.
8763 2018-02-15 00:40:04 Dear Lord let the anointing flow!

8764 2018-02-15 00:39:16 And that water we carry? has pollutants in it from the gas and oil industry. I say stop subsidizing big oil.
8765 2018-02-15 00:39:04 One would think it is really stupid - to destroy the economy you invested all your wealth into. But who told Putin is smart guy. Or - he, probably, still have some, as the whole country belongs to him. But when dollar worth nothing-isn't it even worse than when oil worth nothing?
8766 2018-02-15 00:38:57 If Russia owned Trump why would he be working to destroy their economy? Russia is an ojl based economy. We're the world's largest oil producer When we produce more the price drops. It slams their economy. Remember a few years ago when oil prices collapsed their cash was worthless
8767 2018-02-15 00:38:46 New update today! Drilling taking longer than expected. Oil hit
8768 2018-02-15 00:38:42 Yeah...  i mean, it's not like OUR military wasn't raring to go after that vote. The language I  the bill doesn't matter so much as the context.  Nice try, but i was an adult in 2002. The people that counted all wanted war. WE didn't! She voted to take us to war for oil!
8769 2018-02-15 00:38:41 My skin looks so pretty today, all I have on is coconut oil 
8770 2018-02-15 00:38:35 Why doesn’t Alberta refine own oil and sell it domestically?  Why are we shipping dangerously to China?
8771 2018-02-15 00:38:34 (But at least they're not drilling for oil off the coast of Mar-A-Lago...)
8772 2018-02-15 00:38:30 very disappointed that Zoro vs. Oil Covered Slope is never listed among his notable battles
8773 2018-02-15 00:38:14 And don’t forget military spending. We have to keep that oil and those corporations safe

8779 2018-02-15 00:37:33 My husband had severe Psoriasis that developed into Psoriatic Arthritis. He passed away at the age of 46 as he developed other ailments, Gout and Ankolosing Spondylitis. In the last year of his life, he took Fish Oil Supplement & body covered in Olive Oil, head-toe -w/saran wrap.
8780 2018-02-15 00:37:16 B.P. (not the oil company or the food chain ) awesome work Toddy!
8781 2018-02-15 00:36:58 That'll happen when you're a repugnant stooge for oil and gas companies
8782 2018-02-15 00:36:51 Then he should change his approach to align with the people and not Donald Trump or the oil industry.
8783 2018-02-15 00:36:46 @TheCollectionNC I see you're playing Midnight Oil in Searcy this April??

My brain is McDonald's fries.

8789 2018-02-15 00:36:29 That is one sharp-looking ride. White looks good on a race car/truck when you match it with the right color and pattern.
8790 2018-02-15 00:36:28 I mix coffee grains, coconut oil and sea salt and use it once a week on my underarms.

8802 2018-02-15 00:33:42 Your premier had the chance to turn Alberta's economy around and diversify it from big oil, but she didn't.  All eggs in one basket and now she's complaining that BC doesn't want to follow down the same erroneous path.  She's literally the CPC.

8815 2018-02-15 00:32:09 My Industry kills people? Do you know how many people died today just driving to work? Let me take away your tires,  heating, oil, and 10s of thousands of other products you use everyday,  made from oil. Do some research,please.
8816 2018-02-15 00:32:06 Grow renewables for sure - but our growing, urbanizing world cannot rely only on renewable energy. The world needs and wants Canadian #oil & #natgas
8817 2018-02-15 00:32:01 Soon as we become the main oil exporter we will start cutting into that debt
8818 2018-02-15 00:32:01 That video with the lady who was dragged out of a legislation meeting for reading out contributions from oil companies to the lawmakers, we need to do THAT with NRA.

8821 2018-02-15 00:31:49 Fair enough but besides Horcoff and maybe Stoll . . . Those are 3rd and 4th line players. Based on that as what AHL depth is supposed to be that the current Oil dont have any 3rd or 4th line players waiting in the wings.
8822 2018-02-15 00:31:27 So allowing coal dust in streams, known toxic chemicals 2b used near children, cutting clean air/water regulations, encouraging a dying industry-coal-fighting for gas/oil deregulation ... how does all that fit in?? PUBLIC SERVANT-deal with the public #pruittgocoachorgohome
8823 2018-02-15 00:31:15 “to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he might be glorified.”

8826 2018-02-15 00:30:42 I suspect Trump & Morons will say, "Great!" because they don't understand our oil supply is finite. They don't care!
8827 2018-02-15 00:30:39 no, cleansing oil can basuh your pores dari clogged sbb biasakan pakai sunscreen, foundation and else so semua tu clogged kan pores. if guna cleansing oil dia akan bersihkan semua tu so pores tak tersumbat. after cleansinv oil baru guna cleanser biasa
8828 2018-02-15 00:30:35 Take a bath instead with some lavender oil.
8829 2018-02-15 00:30:31 Alberta benefits from the oil sands - but so too does every other province. Oilsands are a national resource and @TransMtn is a national project
8830 2018-02-15 00:30:29 Good for you.

You want Saudi/Qatari oil money when they have human rights violations?

They are the scum of the earth. You wouldn’t be allowed to drive or vote in their country.

8838 2018-02-15 00:29:31 You need a technically-minded friend with an oil can and soldering iron.
8839 2018-02-15 00:29:26 No simple answer to this deep subject.  Foolish had no oil.  Prudent (wise) did.  The WIS(E)dom that comes from above is FULL of compassion.  Oil also = readiness for her Grooms return. Oil kept her lamp lit and caused her to be able to see, even in the dark Shining Bride of love
8840 2018-02-15 00:29:15 It is showing how Alberta’s oil sands contribute economically across Canada. They are a national resource, not just a provincial one
8841 2018-02-15 00:29:12 100% agree. War in Syria is about propping up a regime that will allow Qatar to run an oil pipeline through to undermine Russia
8842 2018-02-15 00:29:00 There will always be a certain sad type of person that falls for the snake oil pitch. Cough *Joel * cough.
8843 2018-02-15 00:28:51 ultrabland has almond oil in otherwise that would fix everything  full of grace does as well. to be honest i’m probably going to have to go to the doctors because it was bad before i even used rehab 
8844 2018-02-15 00:28:40 @Lyricoldrap @BridgetteWest 
Look into carb free/ dopemine diets! It optimises calorie burning. Best way to shift a large amount of weight as you can still cook with fat and oil. Anyone can drop a few pounds by eating salads the key is to make it sustainable
8845 2018-02-15 00:28:34 Great.  I hope this includes listening to Indigenous people regarding oil pipelines and other resource use. @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley #cdnpoli #bcpoli

8850 2018-02-15 00:27:31 someone give me a gram of oil for valentines day
8851 2018-02-15 00:27:26 Generally agree, the Fed doesn’t need to hike because 2,5,10’s & 30’s       have steepend so fast, may put the Fed in passenger seat for a bit. Plus the move in rates is old news, deflation because of the inflation is the new story, bonds, oil, financials looking good here..
8852 2018-02-15 00:27:25 double cleansing kalau guna oil cleanser usually akan clogged my pores. Biasa guna cleanser water then cleanser ja 
8853 2018-02-15 00:27:19 The boxes will cost more. Delivery costs & packaging.Another bill of goods being sold by the snake oil salesman. Shamefully pathetic individual
8854 2018-02-15 00:27:17 Attaboy Ralphie keep the jobs in your home province down as oil sector is on edge to invest in a Canada
8855 2018-02-15 00:27:17 Ironic that this is necessary because BC is blocking Albertas attempts to open new avenues of oil exports. On another note, I'd point out that its not just Americans who find it not easy to get BC wine. Try just about any other province in Canada. #freemywine #apoxonallyourhouses

8864 2018-02-15 00:25:51 Yes, we see a Day 4 follow-through. Choppy trade could continue, given 1) relative shallowness of the correction; 2) potential for heavier selling in #bonds; 3) a renewed rise in #crude #oil. But for now, the market has signaled a confirmed uptrend #stocks
8865 2018-02-15 00:25:50 At least all this crap has reminded  me to oil my countertops!

8867 2018-02-15 00:25:48 I exfoliate with sea salt & honey. Use an organic face wash. Vitamin E oil and ponds for moisturizing. I drink lots of water, and wash my face morning and night.

8890 2018-02-15 00:22:05 Say no to #TransMountain tankers. Protect the southern BC coast, which belongs to all Canadians, and which is critical habitat for endangered Southern Resident Killer Whales, from potentially catastrophic marine oil spills.

I made cheesy breadsticks, something savoury finally!

オリーブ油は オレイン酸が腸の刺激を促してくれるため、便秘解消効果がある
8896 2018-02-15 00:21:19 Solar and wind are also energy. Oil and gas are only one means of creating energy and increasing new cleaner and cost effective means are coming and Alberta wants to be a part of that energy industry.
8897 2018-02-15 00:21:18 Today’s goal is to check oil and power steering fluid. Anything on top of that is a bonus.
8898 2018-02-15 00:21:07 It’s better than people buying snack cakes, gift cards, and motor oil with “food stamps”. And we all know those EBT cards are traded and used like cash. Your brand of conservatism is unrecognizable to most of us. And I bet if Ted Cruz had thought of this, he’d have been a genius.

8901 2018-02-15 00:20:30 I wanna ask if he ran out of oil/water for that pic cuz idk why there’s dots of moisture on his forehead and a dot on the shirt and dassit.
8902 2018-02-15 00:19:49 I’m trying to not let customers attitudes ruin my day because today’s been amazing, but I can’t stand people who don’t understand that their oil change is gonna take an hour.
8903 2018-02-15 00:19:37 The NRA, the drug companies, the oil industry...own our Congress. We need campaign finance reform. Limit the amount of campaign contributions. Anyone who is taking a million dollar campaign contributions is essentially taking a bribe.
8904 2018-02-15 00:19:31 He should go drink red oil cuz na Sango 
8905 2018-02-15 00:19:20 Dude fuck u guys oil n gas companies r among the most corrupt in the world and they’re horrible for the environment. U think I give a shit he drives an SUV? Ur guys time is ending, renewables r our future. Fuckin dinosaurs
8906 2018-02-15 00:19:18 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
8907 2018-02-15 00:19:11 Especially 80+ Year Old Men who sadly WON'T BE AROUND TO SEE the devestation they have CAUSED OUR PLANET. Keep oil and gas in the ground. Clean Renewable energy sources are the future The MAJORITY OF AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT IT & WE'RE GETTING IT WITH OR WITHOUT GOVERNMENT HELP

Middle East peace

IF it’s possible, whoever achieves the feat of bringing ALL the M.E. players together to forge a peace accord will be recognized as true leader of global order.
8910 2018-02-15 00:18:58 People drink and drive so we obviously should ban alcohol and motorized vehicles....kindve funny how there was an oil spill and the guy had smoked marijuana but the left wants to make that perfectly legal

8914 2018-02-15 00:17:52 I've started to measure pan temperature by the smoke point of my olive oil, which I guess is pretty normal. 

But if I ever switch olive oil brands, I'm probably screwed.
8915 2018-02-15 00:17:44 @glassbottommeg I seem to remember you saying you make edibles, if I'm not totally off on that, do you wash your oil?
8916 2018-02-15 00:17:42 Diffuser knocked my goofy ass out with that lavender oil mist 
8917 2018-02-15 00:17:30 so i went for an oil change because i was almost 2k miles over. i was   that far over because i was busy. sitting there i was thinking  go  me.  one thing off my list... then i leave and drive maybe a mile down  the road and the tire pressure light goes on. FUCKING HELL!!!
8918 2018-02-15 00:17:14 i'm trying to believe that it's coincidence. the oil change guys did actually put my car BACK on my list of things to deal with. but still, my car is now right back on the list of things to handle #forfuckssake
8919 2018-02-15 00:17:13 Matthew 25:4..But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
8920 2018-02-15 00:16:37 Petrol and diesel prices are ₹72.94 and ₹63.50 per litre respectively in Delhi, the prices are much higher than what they were back in mid-November when the Brent crude oil price was in the same range as on 13 Feb 2018.
8921 2018-02-15 00:16:36 TRUMP SAID DURING HIS presidential electioneering that he was "going to grab their oil", referring to Syria & Iraq.  Genie Energy (a Rothschild company) is drilling NOW on the Golan Heights from the largest oil deposit ever found in ME. Rothschilds now have contract for Iraqi oil
8922 2018-02-15 00:16:34 Mega wealthy billionaires/millionaires wth properties in Long Island East End in Montauk, Hamptons etc aren’t going 2b happy wih oil drilling & rigs off their shore. If they support #CorrupTrump they r complicit in the death of LI economy tourism fisheries beauty. Oil spills kill
8923 2018-02-15 00:16:32 @KathleenLights1 Hey Kat, quick question!  What was the oil you used to put in your eyelashes to help them grow when they got burned?  Castor?  I had a candle mishap .
8924 2018-02-15 00:16:14 I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love, but all I needed was some coconut oil. Don't worry about the small things, I know I can  do all things. Momma always told me it would alright.
8925 2018-02-15 00:15:56 can you put coconut oil on your asshole asking for a friend
8926 2018-02-15 00:15:50 Ash Wednesday & Blessed Oil Starting off the season the best way I know how. It’s the season of letting go
8927 2018-02-15 00:15:47 I found myself watching Gordon Ramsay w/his Mom, kids,wife. I’m vegan so it’s really rough but I find myself liking and hope he goes vegan for his health.  Vegetables he’s amazing. He throws so much oil on everything it will make you so fat.  Eating animals so unhealthy.
8928 2018-02-15 00:15:47 Matthew 25:3..They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
8929 2018-02-15 00:15:44 Fuel costs up .50¢ per gallon already making 80 year old Oil Tycoons Richer on Our Back's. Read the Constitution. For the People by the people. Taking from the poorest to give to the Wealthiest is Wrong immoral and unjust No one person NEEDS A BILLION DOLLARS ESPECIALLY
8930 2018-02-15 00:15:21 Why don’t u put that $ into solar and wind, and into training people who r losing coal jobs. Y not support clean energy that is sustainable and long term, decades of new jobs. Y waste $ on filthy oil & more pipelines when we have the technology to change?
8931 2018-02-15 00:15:15 coconut oil makes me a better person
8932 2018-02-15 00:15:10 RT @LivingSafely: #Nabisco #Oreo #Chocolate #Cookies this February? Their top three ingredients are sugar, wheat flour and oil.
8933 2018-02-15 00:15:08 For the most part she had put her point across; that corporations are subverting the rights of all land owners to be consulted and give approval for oil drilling on their lands.
8934 2018-02-15 00:15:01 Our country not the other way around. And you're not getting you alleged shares in oil.

8939 2018-02-15 00:14:09 Weren’t protecting our freedom!  There stealing oil! We are far from free in this country! All this did was create terrorist to the people because we fuel it!
8940 2018-02-15 00:14:00 She's right - smart business from US- block our oil from international markets, buy our oil at a huge discount while they build 1000's of miles of pipeline & more than double oil exports from US to eastern Canada & the world
8941 2018-02-15 00:13:44 Someone tell your president to act like oil and let words roll off. 

THIS IS THEIR RIGHT - TO GATHER AND SAY WHATEVER THEY WANT
8942 2018-02-15 00:13:24 Caping for oil cartels is a bad look in 2018.

8946 2018-02-15 00:12:35 My view: Powerful people here in the UK do not want trolleybuses because they want oil companies to pay bigger dividends. To these people the stock market is more important than human health.
They also do not like trams, so we have very few of these.
8947 2018-02-15 00:12:25 Your reply is a reflection of your immature and unprofessional behavior.   I was alive during the 70's oil embargo-I do not need a 20's something to tell me about what happened.
8948 2018-02-15 00:12:22 It's basically a crash diet. If you want to learn more, I suggest picking up Lyle McDonald's Rapid Fat Loss Handbook or doing your own research online. Emphasis is on very lean protein, greens & supplementation of fish oil, multi, etc.
8949 2018-02-15 00:12:16 @RepCarbajal unless you know how to fly how can you be against oil if you fly jets to Washington? Oil needs to be shared in CA like Alaska where we all get a cut of the money! Don’t make big oil bigger but we all need transportation.

8951 2018-02-15 00:12:11 Exactly what the USA wants! our oil to be their reserve
8952 2018-02-15 00:11:34 When system down and the oil price change didnt auto update, kelam kabut semua 
8953 2018-02-15 00:11:15 A Ribald Scribbler implies he might have a good price for you on a beautiful oil painting depicting a rat from Spite. A landlady elbows someone and whispers.
8954 2018-02-15 00:10:47 Management teams are the think tank of any organization. How many Nigerians do you have at the management level in most of the oil companies? Shell, chevron, Mobil, Agip name it. Nigerians are mostly use as field tools......you need to check it out.

8956 2018-02-15 00:10:19 Endless oil story
8957 2018-02-15 00:10:08 Utter bullshit. Your twisting history out of shape. The EU grew out of the Oil and Steel community created in 1948. Go and read some European history.
8958 2018-02-15 00:10:04 Closed my crude oil shorts at the open. Waiting on bonds to reverse.
8959 2018-02-15 00:09:58 With truffle oil! Reminds me of a dish I tried in Charleston.
8960 2018-02-15 00:09:48 Political talk !? Does the constitution state that people own the oil !? If so' show where it is under what section? Then Queen of England live a fancy lifestyle and we didn't hear British say " they're living in a castle" whatever etc. bottom line is we should contribute to
8961 2018-02-15 00:09:47 The death count went from 1 confirmed to fucking 17 in like a minute...holy shit... #ParklandSchoolShooting   disgusting...boil that fucker in oil.
8962 2018-02-15 00:09:40 By Trump's logic shouldn't China (the enemy) want us NOT to believe in climate change? So that we can keep happily drilling for oil and burning coal as they coast their way into the future with renewable energy tech? #tytlive
8963 2018-02-15 00:09:29 I need some new massage oil
8964 2018-02-15 00:09:25 Turkey is sucking natural resources of North Kurdistan, from water to oil and most of its energy is coming from Kurdish recourses.

8968 2018-02-15 00:08:40 A prime #ValentinesDay evening for singles: discover that you don't know how to make waffles just in time to start up the waffle iron, periodically have a heart attack when you forget to oil the pan after every waffle, and lament your lack of counter space.
8969 2018-02-15 00:08:39 This is a tens unit. Snake oil. I know people that tried this and hard no benefit. You can’t shock a person into shape.  If so we would all be plugged in.

8971 2018-02-15 00:08:23 My roommate is frantically trying to clean the upstairs guest room/office and trying to make it look nice for his valentines date, and part of me wants to be like, "can i offer you this tasteful FAWL oil painting from the Sarah collection to add ambiance?"
8972 2018-02-15 00:08:01 Seems a bit harsh. Sure the haircuts a bit off for a guy his age and it looks like years of heavy drinking have taken a toll but Van Badham is no oil painting either and shes been getting a run on lately.
8973 2018-02-15 00:07:13 No lady, I work hard, and raised 2 daughters on my own. I'm a woman who succeeded in the Oil and Gas Industry when women weren't accepted. I broke through those walls. What's your excuse??
8974 2018-02-15 00:07:05 それ最高っすd(￣ ￣)
8975 2018-02-15 00:07:02 With respect Russia commandeering Middle East no dictating, Russia owns Syria Putin will call the tune, they have 2 bases, he will grab the oil, he has a platform to fire missiles into Med states and Europe, Putin wants all oil producing countries for him to steal the revenue
8976 2018-02-15 00:06:58 He gave his shorty a bag full of French fries and baby oil.

8980 2018-02-15 00:05:11 Some companies where you are six months on/off already do it. If you work on an oil rig and you spend your six months off on the booze then they won't let you come back. I almost hope that does spread. Staff who cheered on drug testing should have spoken out

8987 2018-02-15 00:03:46 You are completely right. It is a total and utter disgrace. Increasingly, the efforts of the local green communith are geared towards kicking our oil habit though. That's a fairly new development.
8988 2018-02-15 00:03:43 Oh yay it came in on time! Happy Valentine's Day babe! I love you 
8989 2018-02-15 00:03:40 you are off oil Ha Ha What do you heat your house with? drive your car with? Cook your food with?

8994 2018-02-15 00:02:42 not getting our oil 2 tide water aids US oil corporations as they can charge more 4 the oil US produces. It also means Canadians must use US oil. Or oil from countries where women's rights and human rights are not valued. Nor are their environmental standards as high as Canada's
8995 2018-02-15 00:02:42 I dont think Madrid is paying off UEFA or anything crazy like that. I just think the organization realizes who can make more money further down the line. Here's a hint. It's not a team that came in to it's powers recently thru oil/blood money

8998 2018-02-15 00:02:32 Totally agree. Way too many people have been looking out for #1 in DC instead of actually doing the right thing. At some point in time, we as a country will have to tell some big special interest groups like the NRA, Oil, Pharma etc to GTFO!
