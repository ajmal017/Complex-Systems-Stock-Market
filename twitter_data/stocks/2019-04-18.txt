Hey @STOCKSWAGER is it Stock Swagger? or Stocks Wager? Stock S. Wager? Wagger? Are you short or long?

12 2019-04-18 23:42:20 I don't know who needs to hear this but take your money out of the fucking bank and buy stocks.
13 2019-04-18 23:41:09 That would be all that joker can offer... for the moment (intel they either nerfed him or buffed him). He can be a little gimmicky when talking about summoning his persona and good luck trying to use arsene twice with one out of your three stocks.
14 2019-04-18 23:40:36 IPOs will hurt the market. Funds will sell stocks to buy the IPOs.
15 2019-04-18 23:40:20 Another example: Dunkin Donuts, $77/share, 52 week low is $60, and a dividend payer. My point is that there are still a lot of good retail stocks out there, much lower risk than new techs, that we often overlook.

 Say 1% makes its way into crypto = $2 trillion market cap.

 $BTC remains at 53% market value we are looking at:

$55,000 per bitcoin.

39 2019-04-18 23:31:27 I need the persona sauce to even take stocks at that % :(

47 2019-04-18 23:21:52 ross would be right at home in low float stocks
48 2019-04-18 23:21:38 I’m new with #ACT trading room. My honest opinion is that if you listen to @AjTrader7, and learn what he’s doing, you will succeed. I’m up and down for the week, but learned a few things. Lesson 1 to myself: Take small positions on these gapping stocks.
49 2019-04-18 23:20:55 Just to be on the safe side & sure if your stocks.

52 2019-04-18 23:18:57 Thanks! I’m just a dude who likes to trade low float, high growth stocks mostly based on setup and volume 
53 2019-04-18 23:16:09 I really wanna try stocks soon. Once I save a reasonable amount , buy shares and save the dividends. He had me at k36,000 dividend for 10,000 shares in Zambia breweries. But 10k shares though. Issa lot. Also, fixed deposit, and roll over the interest.
54 2019-04-18 23:15:42 Gotta have an enemy to two to justify pumping tax dollars into defense stocks.
55 2019-04-18 23:15:41 Stocks and Bonds.
56 2019-04-18 23:14:54 @JosephDeGolyer you never answered my question on how you got the square stocks and how they where doing. I cant seem to figure out how to do it even though I've not tried overly hard 
57 2019-04-18 23:13:45 on god when i get smash ult im gonna make sure to get the best dick shaped custom map to rack up 999% 1 stocks just like the old days

60 2019-04-18 23:11:37 But there is no stocks used in this there is like a look
61 2019-04-18 23:10:43 Yu bound to bag something at Walmart.. nothing but stocks in the building
62 2019-04-18 23:09:54 I go through 20 or apple Products every year & never have any problem with them, yesterday Samsung Fold is Breaking down on people, this is the second time that Samsung phone is having problems. First it was the note 7 & now it the Fold. Thank god I have apple stocks lol
63 2019-04-18 23:09:29 Bump stocks likely saved lives. PADDOCK fired 1,100 rounds hitting 480 people at an optimum range of 300 yards with a negated down angle. 

His hit rate is 480/1100=43.63%

Of 480 hit, 58 died (lethality)58/480=12.83% (pathetic)

Survival rate=87.73%

The bump stocks saved lives.
64 2019-04-18 23:09:28 Ever since I started listening to this podcast, my workouts doubled, I’m having the best sex of my life, and my stocks went through the roof!
65 2019-04-18 23:06:52 Ouais c'est exactement ce que je me disais quand Roch a 3 stocks ma palu, mais je suis content je commence à maîtriser mon stress c'est positif pour la suite
66 2019-04-18 23:06:48 My stocks went up today. Good day
67 2019-04-18 23:06:00 It could be worse - you could have taken his Tom Lee of @fundstat- advice last year on #BTC . #bitcoin #finance #stocks #fintech #Crypto
68 2019-04-18 23:04:30 All I can say is that I'm mainly in cash and long term holds of some stocks. Risk/reward here isn't worth it to me. Wait for the setup.
69 2019-04-18 23:03:01 Investments? Stocks? Savings? Surplus? Why, yes... it “is” reading class! Ask our 6th graders where they would get the most bang for their buck! #edchat #PACelementary #pacschools
70 2019-04-18 23:02:34 Please please chase sometimes with Eigaon (Arsene side b) with Joker. If you land one and double jump and pressure with another one, you can definitely cheese stocks around 70-90 depending on stage. Same concept as explosive flame with Palutena
71 2019-04-18 23:02:31 Joe Granville?! I bet the vast majority of folks have no idea who that guy is!  He was old school (and old!) back in the early 80’s when I first started with stocks.  People listened when he spoke, but was wrong when the Dow popped to 3k & higher & Joe screamed “bear market!” 
72 2019-04-18 23:01:27 Apparently this is what happens if you question this guy Tom Lee's calls. I wonder what he has to say to all the new traders that took his positive statements  on BTC to $25,000 by EOY 2018 etc as fact #bitcoin #trading #stocks #markets #Crypto
73 2019-04-18 22:59:08 ANY DESIGNER CAN MAKE A PROFESSIONAL HEADER JUST SLAP STOCKS FROM GOOGLE AND BOOM.

74 2019-04-18 22:58:20 Now next phase of my day ( after stocks and gambling): basketball bets! Wish me good luck:)
75 2019-04-18 22:58:06 It can go to 120, I remember vividly years ago @jimcramer when a stock goes past 90 (which the asset of Litecoin did to almost $100$) then there’s a natural tendency to gravitate to 120 after, Litecoin psychologically can go to 120 on FOMO the same way as those stocks.I’m a buyer
76 2019-04-18 22:57:53 I surely hope so. Could be amazing if this was like holding stocks in @Apple in the early 00. Getting into the next great investment on the ground floor 
77 2019-04-18 22:56:39 9998/ Also, I really understand this medium, that medium being twitter, and do not own any stocks in tttthreads.
78 2019-04-18 22:54:03 In the Annual Good Friday Eve Panic we managed adequate stocks of beer and wine but absolutely no coffee.

Most abject failure yet.
79 2019-04-18 22:53:43 highkey wanna invest in stocks 
80 2019-04-18 22:52:32 I mean have you seen bank stocks recently?
81 2019-04-18 22:52:31 Let me buy some off you my stocks running out
82 2019-04-18 22:52:08 Because of her husband's stocks in Apple, Comcast, Shutterfly, Disney, and Facebook. That's how.
83 2019-04-18 22:51:27 I bet the inkjet printer company stocks went up today. The Mueller Report has so many blackouts that they probably sold out of ink in an instant.  #MuellerThursday #TrumpObstructed
84 2019-04-18 22:50:42 Yeah, it would be cool to invest in stocks in bitlife

87 2019-04-18 22:48:29 wait so what considers the “end” when u have stocks
88 2019-04-18 22:47:40 Technically a selloff of pot stocks.
89 2019-04-18 22:47:28 Stocks can’t be predicted accurately either.  Investment in stocks or cards is much more a belief in the long term viability of the USA  economy & capitalism
90 2019-04-18 22:45:56 No one shows a p/l on stocks either as prices move up & down until year end when 1099’s come out. I’m not an advocate of flipping, rather longer term investment with high end cards.  The data is very compelling
91 2019-04-18 22:44:01 Born to trade weed stocks lol
92 2019-04-18 22:43:15 I got two raises this last year. I also got the best tax refund in forty years. My stocks are booming. Democrats take over and it will go to crap. Over taxing you and passing stupid laws.
93 2019-04-18 22:42:42 In your broadcast you insinuate that I was comparing "prospects" to amazon stock. Not what I did. The point I made is cards rise and fall in value similar to stocks. That is literally where my point ends. I am not saying you can predict anything...
94 2019-04-18 22:40:24 Stick to stocks and bitching about the Fed
95 2019-04-18 22:39:09 Some stocks, some bonds, some ETFs.
96 2019-04-18 22:39:04 What a moron. WBB has incredible amounts of talent that goes under-appreciated and under-watched. Watching #ZagsWBB was some of the most fun I’ve ever had. @JoshPerk13 and @Sloot22 have the best vision I’ve seen outside of Magic and John Stocks. Preach on @genocrandall
97 2019-04-18 22:38:51 If she can't spell, how can we trust her maths about insect numbers and food stocks?
98 2019-04-18 22:38:50 That’s 1st grade analysis. The point is can you predict card values like stocks? 100% no way.
99 2019-04-18 22:38:42 La première compilation avait été compilée par Maxime Guitton qui organisait les concerts Ali Fib sur Paris. Référence TFR002. La tracklist est superbe. Là il reste des stocks je crois.
100 2019-04-18 22:37:42 Hehe he read in the metro re #ExtinctionRebellion  the fat cat capitalist business men are complaining they are loosing millions, would that be money made off hedge funding and stocks  serves em right they inflate the cost of living for the rest of us.
101 2019-04-18 22:36:19 These stocks shot their load at the open.  Trump signs that STATE Bill and the evangelicals who gave him a pass on finger-banging models will lose their shit.  He can’t afford 2 lose that base.
102 2019-04-18 22:33:58 Terrified that #auspol People will come to the Realisation that Founded by Murchochs Father Tax Exempt #IPA are the Instigators of Every Rotten Policy that #LNP Inflicts on #AU 
THEY & their Vile #MSM Minions need putting in Stocks & to be pelted with Rotten Fruit
103 2019-04-18 22:33:43 Not for the BlackStones of the world - sovereign money, pension funds etc. but stocks perhaps yes

My observation: the world is apparently awash with money but nobody feels rich or secure - how will they feel if we ever see a recession?
104 2019-04-18 22:33:07 Don't feel bad he,Tom Lee blocked us also for calling him out on his #bitcoin calls over the past year and on how many new traders he potentially lead to slaughter with his pounding on the table. Anyone can be wrong This guy is exceptionally unprofessional #stocks #finance @CNBC
105 2019-04-18 22:32:33 Parianas @_machiparu_ Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
106 2019-04-18 22:31:54 I own a price guide website. I’m working on a new one for SCR. I’m totally aware cards go up. But I’ve yet to see someone show me proof (like I have done with stocks, COMC, Amazon selling) that they bought and sold at the right times. It’s not predictable nor consistent.

110 2019-04-18 22:28:50 @RiskReversal Dan your "Pro" friend Tom Lee just blocked a few of us that called him on the carpet for his horrible #bitcoin calls over the past year - so much for being a professional - who would invest with this guy or his firm? #stocks #trading #cryptotrading #fintech #finance
111 2019-04-18 22:28:22 @rbfxdls yeah fuck bio stocks.
112 2019-04-18 22:27:45 Really, do you care to explain why there is near ZERO complainance with bans in several states? IF the polls were right, these state's police would have thousands upon thousands of bump stocks and large capacity magazines.
113 2019-04-18 22:27:38 keep "JBLU" in ur bucket list to buy #stocks whenever time is right & overall market comes down significantly.
114 2019-04-18 22:27:36 im swamped with,,, BUSINESS

stocks, bonds, golden parachutes
115 2019-04-18 22:25:48 I hear you. But at the same time, I used to go on StockTwits every night and find the sub $50 stocks that were getting the most bullish talk and short it the following day or week. The success rate was pretty astonishing.
116 2019-04-18 22:24:37 Hangin out with some of @BLAZINGKNIGHT50's Discord crew via Smash, if you wanna look cool too, come join us! Lobby is called Lookin' cool, Joker! 7 minutes, 3 stocks, no items. ID is 1QVSJ

119 2019-04-18 22:20:52 Pushing junk? We advise members all day on stocks we like & why, I practice what we preach & went for this b/c I believe in what we tell members. Look at top holdings & weights. I've owned this fund for over a year, it's not pushing junk, it's putting my money where my mouth is!
120 2019-04-18 22:20:24 So this uncle really asked me what's the point of my finance degree and my investment job since I can't tell him which stocks to buy?
121 2019-04-18 22:19:16 They did make it so that it would be easier to summon a Persona in later stocks at least and he's decent enough without it but not amazing unlike other characters like Wolf and Snake (who weren't nerfed badly for some reason ^^; )
122 2019-04-18 22:18:40 The best trade at the moment is long $Vix $gold and treasuries and short stocks
123 2019-04-18 22:18:29 like john locke writing about the beauty of ‘liberty’ that inspired our constitution while concurrently having stocks in the slave trade. the foundation of white america is a lie and i too am very sick of this narrative

Du coup ça peut aller vite.

Après c'est complexe y a énormément de facteurs qui font qu'on prend ou non du poids

129 2019-04-18 22:11:19 And for everything else you’ve mentioned: pro-abortion: Trump has continued to fund Planned Parenthood
pro-gun restrictions: Trump outlawed bump stocks by EO
Anti-wall: Trump turned down ~$30 billion back in Dec
Pro-tax increase: Trump raised taxes (through tariffs)
130 2019-04-18 22:11:14 Thanks for the heads up 00. What kind of trouble though? 

Thats why i wait for volume reversals before buying downtrending stocks now. Let the market makers behind the stock prove direction first. Im just the smart little fish haha.
131 2019-04-18 22:10:32 I had some dumb penny stock last fall. Rode it from 4 c to 8 c, made a few bucks. Noticed it was 0.56 this week. Coulda had a ten-bagger! #BuffettIamNot. But yeah, markets go up over time. Best holding time is forever, if you find the right stocks! (no easy task!)
132 2019-04-18 22:10:32 A cnd company bought USA weed stocks. We went up. They went down
133 2019-04-18 22:08:46 Lmao. On the real I absolutely support banning bump stocks, automatic guns, support background checks and mental health restrictions 1000% it’s sad that common sense can’t be used in politics. The Dems aren’t trying to take away our guns. Just try to prevent psychos from getting

146 2019-04-18 21:57:47 When choosing #stocks you can read every news article available on the internet, but that won’t answer the most important questions: 

When to buy
How much to buy
When to sell a losing position
When to sell a winning position

It only creates a false sense of security.

263 2019-04-18 20:46:10 #Equity indices continue to grind higher. Though for anyone paying attention, the feature this week has been the massive sector rotation taking place, most notably #HealthCare and #RealEstate stocks now being hated after being the darlings not long ago.

264 2019-04-18 20:46:08 Ok so that's because of the "catch-up" "limit-esque" gauge filling when Joker is behind in stocks / damage?
265 2019-04-18 20:45:03 Almost made my first $100 week in stocks this week. 
Tomorrow could be the day!

I love the small incremental gains over time. Seeing progress makes me work harder.
266 2019-04-18 20:44:53 CBD stocks.   By far the largest mkt opportunity.
267 2019-04-18 20:44:41 I’m surprised health insurance stocks are dropping with surging sales of Xanax.
268 2019-04-18 20:44:41 This little piggy went to market. This little piggy invested in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds while maintaining a well diversified portfolio and is retiring at the age of 37.
269 2019-04-18 20:44:34 Stocks fall in the su would be so sad thinking about  blue passports.
270 2019-04-18 20:44:06 I am way more confident in all the shitcoins listed in my tweet to be worthless & equivalent to useless penny stocks than I am about #Bitcoin going above $100,000.

273 2019-04-18 20:42:39 Questrade is impossible for using on penny stocks, I use rbc if I trade those, that’s why usually I prefer trading higher priced stocks. Try to get filled on the bid/ask when possible to avoid the fee
274 2019-04-18 20:42:08 Anytime we’ve had people with day jobs thinking they were going to get rich flipping houses, stocks, bitcoin, and cards - THE MARKET CRASHED!

I like @garyvee - but cards are NOT an investment or a way to pay bills. Be smart.
275 2019-04-18 20:42:00 I don't think that is the solution! Trainers have 3 motive 1st Earn Stake money 2nd manage handicap 3rd create opportunities for owner to have a bet. Many may or may not agree with the third point. I don't think anything else works. If a trainer is not performing his stocks drops
276 2019-04-18 20:41:30 Still a big mess: How some healthcare stocks fared Wed. + Thurs:

DaVita $DVA -7.7%, +2.3%

277 2019-04-18 20:41:05 Everyone wants to be entitled to a large sum of money without the effort and experience.

That's like taking the burger flipper from McDonald's, throwing him into a Gulfstream plant, and telling them to build us a multi-million dollar jet.

278 2019-04-18 20:40:39 You’re right Michael and that’s why I’m heavily invested in marijuana stocks.
279 2019-04-18 20:40:31 Well if you want to invest in uranium directly there are ETFs that literally just hold uranium but I’m mainly referring to stocks of companies that are uranium miners etc.

281 2019-04-18 20:39:48 was more a funny throw away comment...most average joe portfolio has a few different stocks, since they don't want to risk everything on one. Agreed that many have got rich going heavy on one, but as counterpoint how many did that and lost?
282 2019-04-18 20:39:30 I pointed out the BS when the stock was at 2.40.  I don’t short 2 dollar stocks but I did put on a short of VFF. Goldy is classic pump and dump.  Claims he sold $CXXI yesterday before the Canopy news hit then said it was a joke.
283 2019-04-18 20:38:28 I don’t remember that, but I do remember getting killed on my taxes this year and my stocks took a bit of a dive. There is a dip in investment in American companies b/c the rest of the world has moved past. I’m sure your stocks are doing well, though. Ha!
284 2019-04-18 20:38:20 Yeh when I look back the best trading days have been some of the simplest with only 1 or 2 stocks traded.  So important to get a winner on those morning drives.  My next best trades normally are afternoon fads/breakdowns have pulled some good trades from these.
285 2019-04-18 20:37:45 the stocks.
286 2019-04-18 20:37:18 I'm usually not in the "market" stocks so I fall into the trap that they won't get hit with the market but not true.  need to get out wait and start over.  hard to have that discipline and patience for me.
287 2019-04-18 20:36:14 $132 for $DIS seems cheap. One of the few stocks I am long on. Perfect company to park your cash and watch it grow. #Stocks #Investing

294 2019-04-18 20:33:33 After seeing what happened with $ZOOM, I’m starting a software holding company to incorporate shell companies, list them as public penny stocks based on companies which raise B and C rounds from prominent VC firms and will wait 5-10 years to profit when they inevitably IPO.

299 2019-04-18 20:31:23 Will someone just take @AdamSchiff to an S&M parlor and give him what he really likes?  He’s way too twisted for prime time and needs to be in stocks for a while.
300 2019-04-18 20:30:04 Having the right overall plan isn’t good enough. We know long term where most stocks will go but timing is key. Was early on a few nice faders today and paid the price. Using this as yet another growth opportunity and will be fine tuning rules over the the holiday break. HAGW! 
301 2019-04-18 20:29:41 That's what you dream of when playing the penny stocks.

307 2019-04-18 20:27:02 Drawing a comparison doesn't mean that they are on the same scale....

The comparison is in the fact that like in the stock market, you're searching for something that's value will rise over a period of time. Some cards/stocks are safe bets, some are high risk/reward.
308 2019-04-18 20:26:50 However much I needed to build my stream room the exact way I want it. Then I would pay up by Bill's for the next 10 years. And then I would get whatever else I wanted then invest the rest into money making ideas and stocks

327 2019-04-18 20:20:33 I'm not an expert, but I believe all trades show up when they are executed.  For stocks > $1, the trades that are made in "dark pools" are the ones that do not end with a whole cent (i.e. $5.3799).
328 2019-04-18 20:20:28 Hell no it dont. Unless you're fighting like, void, in which case you better be able to combo like a Mf'er or you'll be at 150 or down 2 stocks before he at 40.

337 2019-04-18 20:17:24 Good finish to the day, particularly for healthcare that was down big at one point and came back.  XLV actually finished green.  If Monday is green (particularly if it opens higher than today's close) it would confirm today's Dragonfly doji on most of the healthcare stocks...
338 2019-04-18 20:16:41 I'm getting really good at trading stocks and i can feel this is where I make my big money... its the same feeling i felt when i flipped a house and I knew a nice profit was coming my way

389 2019-04-18 19:46:38 Okay so we can agree on a few things right? If you see someone stage humping on netplay every time they take your stocks and when the take a game, you’d assume that they’re being disrespectful right?
390 2019-04-18 19:46:36 Stocks I follow (but may not own) that announced earnings this week:
4/16 $NFLX
4/17 $ASML
4/18 $CHKP $ISRG
391 2019-04-18 19:46:34 Just invest in more lucrative weed stocks and preserve your knee so you’ll be able to perform for 910 more days
392 2019-04-18 19:46:23 If it was actually predictable & obvious, that'll already be factored into the price by the giant funds and pro traders buying it up long before it's ever apparent to an everyday investor. People get lucky but nobody picking single stocks beats the market long term
393 2019-04-18 19:46:15 Anyone that is selling large amount of shares.   Blocks are typically anywhere from 10,000 shares or more. For stocks on the CSE, the house accounts for the majority of the total volume on an avg day. The CSE has TERRIBLE liquidity & They have the ability to control trends.
394 2019-04-18 19:45:51 I’m not crying for them or crying for those who lose. You know the risk when you put your money on the line. I’m also not going to hold the people who make the lines and take the bets responsible for others bad decisions. Some make millions some lose everything. It’s like stocks.
395 2019-04-18 19:45:04 That + the Medicare for All concerns resulting in a broad based sell off on healthcare stocks
396 2019-04-18 19:44:57 Didn’t you say it yourself a few days ago that a system we know it ended in 2008? Stocks don’t go down anymore. At least as long as TRUMP rules it’s buy and turn off the monitor for a couple of years.
397 2019-04-18 19:44:22 $GSKY $BV $CZR $GLUU $FNJN $WDC So much green today. Love these days with so much green in flat markets. Watch for emerging leaders. #stocks
398 2019-04-18 19:41:31 Over 4 million jobs, record stocks, tax cuts, isis destroyed, SCOTUS appointments, record low unemployment, record high home ownership, on and on. All verifiable with simple google search.
399 2019-04-18 19:41:14 HFs may be providing the fuel for the move. High opens indicative of price management in high short interest stocks.
400 2019-04-18 19:39:37 A 3-tweet version of my #SafsCentennial talk:
In the future, we have several tools for facing uncertainty in forage stocks: 
 tradeoff discussion is essential
 environmental covariates for estimating abundance may be useful but they have to be rigorously tested first (1/3)

406 2019-04-18 19:35:51 I also gave an equally (or more) reasonable explanation of why I would taunt between stocks and that it wasn’t BM because it was funny and ridiculous. Not because I’m a salt lord LOL I gave him tons of compliments the entire time I was playing him. I even said I’d probably lose.

414 2019-04-18 19:32:56 Thanks @wheeliedealer for recommending ‘how to make six figures in stocks’ by @shiftingshares. Easy read and a brilliant resource for new starters. Also good to flick through as a refresher for people with some experience.
415 2019-04-18 19:32:12 not hard, but it did have a little twist to the answer.  Yes short positions in wildly over valued cult stocks can be considered deep value positions.  They actually share a lot of characteristics with long deep value positions
416 2019-04-18 19:32:05 Il y a certainement des stocks de bois sec. Et il faudra une très grande bâche pour le toit.

425 2019-04-18 19:26:08 I’d love it if anyone did this with single cards. My guess is nobody really does it at scale. Would take a significant investment. You’re holding slabs for days. Cards don’t turn over like sports tickets (or even a garage sale flip) or have liquidity like stocks.

437 2019-04-18 19:20:06 It's called shallow thinking. Because many people are apathetic/dismissive about bump stocks, and uninformed about how bump stocks were outlawed, they blindly take the path of least resistance. It takes being informed and thinking deeper to understand the danger of the BS ban.

445 2019-04-18 19:16:14 Funny...

Whenever I criticize the President for not fully enforcing current immigration law, I am met with the ridiculous retort that "Trump is not a dictator."

Yet these same people applauded when he unilaterally and unconstitutionally banned bump stocks.

Quite ironic.
446 2019-04-18 19:15:24 Oh nah, you can still learn! You can even trace how stocks rise and fall, when to buy, when to sell...I can just play more now because I have the funds to do so, but you can still learn the ins and outs with no money at all!

454 2019-04-18 19:11:21 Long term, the case for equal weighting as an alternative or complement to market cap indices is compelling: but few funds are seen due to the rebalancing costs. There is, however a solution to that. Take exposure to the index by contract without holding and trading the stocks.

461 2019-04-18 19:07:58 The recent batch of long setups are unable to gain any traction here. It feels as if we are at the verge of a base building period as one leader after the other is breaking down through logical support. I am cash heavy now and realized most of my short sale profits. #stocks
462 2019-04-18 19:06:59 But post a P/L, balance sheet, cash flow statement of all your prospecting. Or find me someone that has one. It doesn’t exist because it’s a hobby. Whereas there are billionaires because of Amazon stock. Not to mention many stocks offer cash flow without having to sell.
463 2019-04-18 19:05:27 Expected? Based on what? What did the report base that on? 

What did Trump actually do? 

Not like he sold 20% of our Uranium to Putin and brokered an expensive speaking event to the Russian bank holding the stocks like the Clinton's did. So what did he DO?

467 2019-04-18 19:03:45 I think you buy too much into the fear mongering. There has been no proposal set forth that does anything besides mandates background checks. It was trump who just banned bump stocks, I suggest reading other sources.

477 2019-04-18 19:00:51 You could hold your trigger finger on your belt loop and bounce the trigger off you're finger.   Bump stocks are illegal though.   Do you want to ban semi-autos?  Why do you want the govt to have monopoly on deadly force?
478 2019-04-18 19:00:09 Trump banned bump stocks the only freedom conservatives supposedly only support.  The truth is...they don’t give a fuck about us!

497 2019-04-18 18:53:27 Irony alert. Back in Jan. Allen said this:

500 2019-04-18 18:53:21 $SPY Those that want to wait until they're more comfortable to buy stocks are often times already at a disadvantage. It's not so unusual for the better opportunities (with less risk) to buy to occur when the market is most hated, the time when most aren't interested in buying.
501 2019-04-18 18:53:20 Ok...  so are you trading as soon as the price changes? The times seem close together. It seems quicker than stocks, but it seems kinda sporadic.

507 2019-04-18 18:51:08 Stocks are attractively extremely over priced.
508 2019-04-18 18:50:43 Because someone has more, that does not always cause someone else to have less. In the instances of corporate executives, it does.

514 2019-04-18 18:48:17 This is data on fund managers trying to beat a market by stock picking. We don’t do that - we use ETFs to get exposure to a wide variety of asset classes/markets at very low cost. The asset allocation is managed, which is very different to picking stocks
515 2019-04-18 18:46:57 Funny how differently your treated on twitter when you use your other account with more followers, especially via private message.. exposes the shallow nature of so many out there, especially those at the top.. #pride #ego #roots #potstocks #stocks

517 2019-04-18 18:44:22 1/ There has been a recent paradigm shift in hedge funds that occurred recently. 

Given the uptick in fed funds rate, hedge funds can actually earn a positive rebate on shorting stocks, currently around +1%

Contrast this 2009-2017 you had to PAY 1% to short stocks (neg rebate)
518 2019-04-18 18:43:57 You are sadly mistaken. It’s okay, you just listen to the rhetoric of folks meant to cause fear. Look at the data yourself. The economy, stocks, and jobs have been on the rise for 8 years now. The first two were rough, but part of that was carry over from the bush mess.

533 2019-04-18 18:36:34 Here's the thing, selling equity in your company via stocks is comparable to someone taking a mortgage out on their home.

Shouldn't businesses be allowed to "pay off their mortgages" through stock buy-backs?

560 2019-04-18 18:17:11 Ah, buying Sets allows me to get exposure to the volatility of crypto without making the trades myself. I see it almost as an ETF for crypto. As more traditional stocks and indexes get tokenized, you could probably create Sets that are cheaper than buying ETFs or mutual Funds

564 2019-04-18 18:15:50 He has been wrong when he banned bump stocks, Banning those items it’s not going to save anybody’s lives.

569 2019-04-18 18:12:16 A lot of yip yap, speculation that market could go up and down, choppy markets, etc. Many thinking that there is no opportunity but I'm continuing by keeping it simple like I've been posting about this week and focusing on fewer (select) stocks. Not boasting but it's working.
570 2019-04-18 18:12:06 Same here. I've been starting to buy ETFs instead. Only occasionally will I throw some money into individual stocks and only if I'm really confident.
571 2019-04-18 18:10:44 I started investing when I got out of college. Set up auto withdrawals from checking for mutual funds. Learned about dollar cost averaging. Then moved into individual stocks. If I were starting again today, I would auto buy/DCA with cryptos on coinbase.
572 2019-04-18 18:10:44 I think the biggest thing you wanna keep in mind is that when you have the lead theres no pressure on you to make things happen. 
Make "i have more stocks" or "i have a big percent lead" your mental trigger to play safe 
Prevents a lot of throws imo

Caution…beware of the bounce: As investors rush for the shares, the demand drives up the price; however, this spike is unpredictable, thus not guaranteed, and it does not usually last more than a few days when stocks are established as long term investments.

642 2019-04-18 17:32:07 Not quite sure I follow, I'm currently on a bender with friends, mate. =) But if I understand correctly: Say you bought at 1, expect it to go to 2 and sell, but you don't know if it will, so in case wrong, you set SL at 0.90, sell to avoid losses, with stocks I set automatic SLs.

648 2019-04-18 17:27:42 Well you’re foolish. Anybody who knows the basics of stocks knows that bio-tech is comparatively high risk. 

Novavax has no revenue stream and the costs to develop a vaccine costs millions, which they don’t have, and have already burned tons of investors.

658 2019-04-18 17:22:18 Depends on how the design. Consider an equal wgt S&P 500 fund. Every wgt is different, but the fund still holds all S&P stocks. As such, the standard S&P index is a relevant benchmark. By contrast, a strategy that owns just the 10 smallest S&P firms: S&P is no longer relevant.

764 2019-04-18 16:35:04 It’s all pretty simple. The govt runs huge deficits, gives tax cuts to corps, corps buy back stocks and pay politicians. Politicians point to stock market. J6P sinks into the mud. Repeat.

768 2019-04-18 16:32:20 Health Care stocks lost 28 billion in market value in just one day of trading due to Grandpa Sanders maniacal attempt to force govt HC on all of us whether we like it or not. Hope your 401 k assets didn’t suffer due to Dems like Sanders.
769 2019-04-18 16:32:05 You Misunderstood. I’m implying much more than trump. He has the @federalreserve in his grip and will do what it takes to keep stocks going up and keep the bubble inflated. Might as well make money.

781 2019-04-18 16:28:16 It's awful for an active trader.  Very limited pre and post market trading and many stocks that I've wanted to trade are not supported.

783 2019-04-18 16:27:50 Ease of use, centralized trading for stocks, STO and crypto curriences.

Better question is how will they survive without such fees?
784 2019-04-18 16:27:45 Ted Farnsworth & Randall Emmett is my best guess. Both have a long history of pump & dump stocks/companies.

Most likely keeping the illusion this is still alive so they can continue to slowly siphon (dilute) cash out.

Still under investigation by the NYAG

It’s the insurance industry, big pharmaceutical who btw uses gov to research for free now, healthcare stocks!
796 2019-04-18 16:23:07 The healthcare stocks are behaving a lot better today. They are not as worried about "Medicare for all" today, as they have been recently.

821 2019-04-18 16:12:00 Wrong. Day trading dollar stocks is like playing at a casino if your not good at technical analysis. Long term Investing in good reliable companies is not only financially responsible but a better option then savings account or cd. Not investing in the stock market is a bad idea
822 2019-04-18 16:11:58 Here's one thing guys, if you only buy stocks that have pretty charts you will never, EVER, buy the lows. And if you only sell stocks after they look bad, you will never, EVER, sell the highs.
823 2019-04-18 16:11:41 Do they NOT realize that they are laughing stocks with no credibility.   I mean.  It’s a pathetic mess

Mainly comes down to proximity to information with stocks. With the volatility in todays markets, I’d go precious metals to better hedge against inflation.

1022 2019-04-18 14:50:50 Tough day today. It's been a momentum-less week this week, tough to trade a lot of these small-cap stocks to the long side. Need to keep working on being selective because I took a lot of C- setup trades this week.

Gotta trade only A+ setups. Lets hope momentum comes back.

1026 2019-04-18 14:50:06 I'll have one more #Ravens 7-round mock draft coming this week, before the #NFLDraft next week.

Stocks have risen, fallen, rumours abound, and things have been said, or thought about, that could (or could not!) greatly change the layout of my mock.

Stay tuned.

...and a small piece of me will die inside from reading it
1034 2019-04-18 14:46:48 When mutual fund managers do well, they take the credit, based on their 'unique ability' to purchase the right stocks. However when they do badly, they always blame the 'external' market conditions.

1035 2019-04-18 14:46:25 “Under current Federal law, residents of Puerto Rico are liable for Federal taxes on income from the States but not on income from the territory.  Interest, dividends, and capital gains from stocks and bonds are taxed based on residence, so no Federal tax is due on that income.”
1036 2019-04-18 14:46:05 @BryanJBerner If you do a search on the internet for “Stocks up after Barr report”you get all the same, Mueller disagrees with Barr, all the facts weren’t there, Dems don’t trust Barr,and Trump did something! Liberalism is not only a mental disorder, it must be terminal 2. 
1037 2019-04-18 14:45:10 "..add to it that the Bicycle pollutes the environment and is under risk of getting stolen, which the ferrari is not!"  ...we should find out what weed this guy smokes and invest in the stocks of this company, because he has to smoke A LOT for this text to write!!

1039 2019-04-18 14:44:58 @PeterSchiff  I've lost a lot of money following your advice of buying Gold and Gold stocks. Markets go up and gold stocks go down due to inverse correlation and lack of fear. Market goes down, and Gold stocks go down with it. No win situation, they always go down. WHY?

1042 2019-04-18 14:43:39 If you had to break down your investments/assets (not including your primary residence), how would you say you're currently split? My largest investment is in my company, then my IRA, then two startups I invested in, then my son's 529, then savings. No stocks outside of IRA/529.
1043 2019-04-18 14:43:24 I’ve seen stocks pump very high even after bankruptcy news.
1044 2019-04-18 14:43:21 According to Vox:
1. The last two years of Obama's Administration the economy so it is not all on Trump.
2.2018 was the worst year for stocks in a decade
3.The manufacturing jobs are still leaving due to Trump"s Trade deal
4.The economic growth has mostly benefited the rich
1045 2019-04-18 14:42:43 But they don't think they will be as they aren't "stupid" and rich people can make money from a financial disaster by shorting stocks or leveraging against the currency drops. Which is what many are doubtless doing. Their prejudice means they believe the poor deserve it.

1051 2019-04-18 14:41:27 Rumour is they were approached by big LP’s for a $4 buyout but they were refused. CEO believes company is worth $10.
1052 2019-04-18 14:41:24 Well, the market will crash when that happens, so most billionaires probably will be for it so they can scoop up stocks extraordinarily cheap.
1053 2019-04-18 14:41:12 “The tax exemption and low rate are only available to people who have not lived in Puerto Rico for 15 years.  Permanent residents of the territory and returning previous residents pay taxes on income up to a rate of 33% and owe 10% of profits from stocks and bonds.”

1076 2019-04-18 14:33:59 By the way, every metric had Obama’s economy steadily improving from Bush’s ‘07/‘08 global financial meltdown. One year into the #GOPTaxScam we have a deficit projected to triple to $1.2 Trillion and the stocks have been flat for over a year. Go to your corner.

1141 2019-04-18 14:16:53 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC if stocks like Sq and roku are dropping for big money to go into qcom, pint rest, zoom, etc. Should we be buying our favorite companies on the dip or following the big money into the exciting dream that comes with an ipo?

1147 2019-04-18 14:14:17 Health insurance and hospital stocks are falling due to M4A talk and I’m just here wondering how the hell any company who takes care of sick people can be traded and become beholden to stockholders who demand only profit?
1148 2019-04-18 14:13:59 Not sure if you look at smaller stocks, but $EVE is also doing the falling wedge after a huge 100% gain

1150 2019-04-18 14:13:31 It's in order. The CMA can take such action. Speculation can adversely affect stock market.
How many people are now willing to buy the affected stocks? 
The temporary demand can escalate the prices to unreasonable prices. Remember share price affects a companies net worth too.

When the companies belong to the State the name is Comunism...
1154 2019-04-18 14:11:51 But we should throw in the markets reaction as well. Stocks bonds and currency have told us that it’s been nothing the whole time...#my2cents

1156 2019-04-18 14:11:43 The RNS didn’t sink the SP, a bad Q4/18 where almost all resource stocks (well..the ones I was in, including this) got trashed, ARCM has not recovered, running down the company whilst wanting the SP higher is counter productive.
1157 2019-04-18 14:11:32 Ron is 100% right that all companies are different with different overhead, etc. 

But the cost of paper is a separate factor that has nothing to do with any other cost like talent, labor, etc..

Printed on coated or uncoated stocks ...talent costs the same.
1158 2019-04-18 14:10:59 I wonder if investors realize that if they own the TSX index, they are holding pot stocks? By my count, there are now 6 pot stocks included.

1207 2019-04-18 13:52:22 Yeah, I just can't get there.  Value has been a consistent underperforming factor for the last ... 20 years. So I think you did get 12% if you were in momentum stocks since it's been nothing but bull for most millennials investing history.

1305 2019-04-18 13:11:50 Paper stock has nothing to do with the reason newspapers are declining.

Paper stock is not a factor here.

1386 2019-04-18 12:21:56 Were you even around in 2000 & 2007 when "Fun de Mentals?" overran the chart monkeys who had been happily pushing stocks into the stratosphere? Just in case you don't know (or remember) those great charts turned into traps pretty darned quickly
1387 2019-04-18 12:21:46 #SBRY was waiting  for a retest of 221 the recent low but the downward momentum is slowing .. its one of those stocks that could easily gap up on Tuesday so taken a small lot long @ 227
1388 2019-04-18 12:21:28 Interesting, a week after Malaysian stocks tumbled, and still nothing from the MOF or even MEA. When it comes to politics, you lot are quick to use your ministry platform to share propaganda, but when it comes to doing your job, nothing. This doesn’t take 6 months to learn
1389 2019-04-18 12:20:59 Dito, but if you trust $WAYL ... 100 points are 100 points. Don't know how $ACB received the highest ranking out of all concepts then ... The general application conditions / score sheets have been released by BfArM though.
1390 2019-04-18 12:17:04 Admiring your discipline with only avg 24 trades/month. I like you OTC trading style, so I will watching your listed trades to learn a thing or 2. I thought you don't trade them. I made 300% (small account off-course) on OTC 2 year now, but losing most gains on listed stocks. tnx
1391 2019-04-18 12:16:16 I was talking about an economic recession which involves everything dropping including the market. We're Disney and many top stocks drop below $25 a share. We've been in wars since beginning of time. Obama raised fuel cost to pay for his outrageous spending.
1392 2019-04-18 12:15:40 Top Buy Stocks:  $AEO, $FCAU, $FCX, $HPQ, $M, $MRVL, $SAN, $SYMC
1393 2019-04-18 12:14:53 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
1394 2019-04-18 12:13:34 Make stocks of RN7 pro available first. Then talk.
1395 2019-04-18 12:12:01 Too bad these stocks don't trade on all this "news"...  The technicals are awesome... the SOX Index just busted the "Old all time high" at 1464 by 100 points!  Misguided are the shorts here, this has been a bad beat for those who expect these things to trade on the fun de mentals
1396 2019-04-18 12:11:57 No, because incomes and real world investments like stocks and bonds and real estate increase with inflation.  If you put your money in alt-coins and ICOs you probably lost at least 90% of it by now.
1397 2019-04-18 12:11:12 Sick. FT alphaville is exhibiting a Death Cross at 200. Dump any stocks with an 'E' in the ticker.

1399 2019-04-18 12:08:51 Stocks: Expecting another intrayear dip in May. Perhaps rebound in Jun. More volatility later. Some say the market normally does well ahead of Presidential election. Billionaire Dalio expecting big drop in stocks, but thinks Fed is more careful on its rate impact on economy.

1401 2019-04-18 12:08:08 Honestly it depends on what type of return you're gonna get. With Penny stocks more likely than not, you won't make a great return they're relatively safe.
1402 2019-04-18 12:06:51 ITKH  , RETC Looks Good! Both Stocks have Volume up over 300% for the last 2-3 days! Breakout imminent!

1404 2019-04-18 12:06:12 Futures on the S&P 500, Dow and NASDAQ 100 took their cue from falling Asian stocks this morning, as investors seemed to shift to risk-off ahead of the Good Friday's market pause.

1406 2019-04-18 12:05:30 Tell me what sounds most attractive to buy:

PS if you pick the first option I know you're lying but that's when you should have bought. Should you buy now? If I knew nothing about stocks I'd probably vote for the second one.

Although I trade in few stocks only. But all ended well Tata Steel,  mind tree,  Bharti. Now as u always say time to enjoy the weekend. Thanks again.

1435 2019-04-18 11:49:40 I would advise not to chase today. Give it a few days to let the price action settle before deciding to go long/short.

I think there are 2,000 better stocks to trade in this market than $PINS $LYFT or $ZOOM
1436 2019-04-18 11:48:06 Nifty gains over 100 points this week led by Tata Motors & TCS

1438 2019-04-18 11:46:09 You can thank Gym Jordan and Mark Meadow for that. See how much money they have tied up in pharmaceutical stocks.

1441 2019-04-18 11:44:08 Another misunderstanding. We are worse of now just as was said. Real wages have fallen, households borrowing more than they earn, business investment at its lowest since the recession, UK stocks marked down, GDP growth retarded in comparison to other G7 members, all real bad.
1442 2019-04-18 11:43:12 It’ll be beer. I am pretty sure the guy has stocks in a brewery the way he is promoting beer drinking in this province. We will have a cheerleading squad next. #onpoli

1451 2019-04-18 11:34:49 Hey cmrade putz. Good job killing the stocks of health insurers, pharma and medical devices companies. Banks should be next.  By the time the primaries start you'll have caused a recession and the dems will be in retreat.  It's almost May Day.  GFY.
1452 2019-04-18 11:34:40 Actions in leading stocks is leading me to get cautious. Bought $SPXS this morning as a hedge. Market isn't in favor of long trades and I won't force trades and get chopped up.
1453 2019-04-18 11:34:31 $QFIN $TIGR $FHL. Three chinese IPOs with an extremely low float compared to the shares outstanding. Artificially restricted supply like this is shady, dangerous and creates a very volatile enviroment. I stick to my rules which force me to avoid such names. #stocks
1454 2019-04-18 11:34:24 Never meant to disappoint you, Khushi. As checked, certain products did not pass the quality checks at the time of procurement thus, went undelivered. Also, the specified offer was valid till stocks last and the same has already been availed in the (1/2)
1455 2019-04-18 11:34:24 When markets go up we get to see these fancy combinations which give one a false sense of feeling that in equal weight, the PE is lower.
Are you buying PE or are you buying stocks.
In equity markets, the big simply become bigger.

1457 2019-04-18 11:32:12 Of the tech stocks that I watch that have reported results in this 1st week of earnings exactly 1 - ERIC had a positive report.

1477 2019-04-18 11:15:59 I was dumbfounded to discover that US politicians have no restriction towards owning stocks in industries for which they write laws. If they are 'allowed' to do that, it should come as no surprise that most of them use this loophole for personal gains. PS. I'm Trump indifferent.
1478 2019-04-18 11:14:17 $zts. Investing (gambling) by index or sectors gives you constant buying opps in stocks like $zts as it a company that makes drugs for fucking animals and is sold off with companies who make drugs for humans. Idiotic but it’s reality

1497 2019-04-18 10:55:03 Okay wow? Like wow? Rather than opening half section to be auction at relatively higher price cause overseas buyers, they reserve the whole stocks as private company just so that they can control in and out of money without taking further damage from outsider.

1500 2019-04-18 10:54:43 Despite the names these are Utes not energy stocks.
$WEC & $NEE are my favs as they usually move faster than the rest, but all slow movers. Also, they have high intra-correlation so if a few going up - all go.
Usually do best with falling input costs (energy) and falling $TNX.
1501 2019-04-18 10:52:41 Bearish price action in indices as well as many stocks.

Was it due to expiry?

1528 2019-04-18 10:26:27 $nbev  If price were the only measure of a stocks worthiness, then simply all stocks going down would be bad & all stocks going up would be good. Luckily that's not the case & with proper due diligence and reasoning, going down presents buying opportunities.  Follow the money.

1546 2019-04-18 10:16:03 Agree on principle but in practice, there MAY be some truth in what they say. When more than 90 percent of returns come from 6 stocks, it’s almost impossible for active managers to beat the bmk even if they identify those 6 stocks. That’s because they have concentration limits

1597 2019-04-18 09:43:15 (Bloomberg) --U.S. equity futures fell and European stocks extended declines on Thursday as weak euro-area factory data compounded a risk-off mood before the long holiday weekend. Treasuries rallied while the yen and dollar strengthened.

"Well jimmy that chad bought at a lower price than now and he's making enough to buy a new car on that trade!"
1605 2019-04-18 09:38:35 Also, selling stocks doesnt necesarily mean those who bought have rights. There are two types of stocks - ordinary and preferred. Ordinary has voting rights, Preferred has none.  So its not healthy to think just because a company is going public, decision making power is shifted.

1627 2019-04-18 09:23:30 Mature forests are carbon neutral, so that's only a 1-time gain. You're confusing stocks and flows. When the inflow is greater than the outflow, you can't solve the problem by enlarging the bathtub. You only delay the overflow by a little bit.
1628 2019-04-18 09:23:26 Seems like about 75% of market participants are convinced that $SPX will break 3,000 before Memorial Day. Complacency is legion. Volume had been a joke for weeks. Yet I remain nervous about shorting stocks with Trump petulantly obsessed with them. He'll stop at nothing.

1665 2019-04-18 08:53:47 The same thing was said about trading stocks, before the era of computer automation and discount brokerages like Charles Schwab or E-Trade.

1743 2019-04-18 07:32:32 Market declined from intra-day high on account of profit booking and ahead of the long holiday. Mid-cap Index and Bank Nifty declined over half percent.  Metal stocks & private banking stocks are witnessing profit booking. Select Auto and Pharma stocks gained.  #MOMarketUpdates
1744 2019-04-18 07:32:00 Toxic on SO many levels - no need to bring race into it - also SO insulting to ANYONE struggling financially"stack the cash in an ISA or grab them some stocks". Thing is it's people who can "grab stocks" who throw the MOST lavish parties! This is prejudice posing as advice.
1745 2019-04-18 07:31:52 is there any kind of scanner for currencies in play? There are plenty for stocks, but for FX? something that would help assessing quickly where to look for momentum play... @TemetNosce101 heard anything?
1746 2019-04-18 07:31:42 For uranium or pot stocks?
1747 2019-04-18 07:30:38   as someone who dabbles in stocks, I get it.  It's a guessing game.

1749 2019-04-18 07:29:21 What do I look at when trading stocks

In order:
- chart formation

- soaking/absorbing/stuff levels
- volume and volume forecast 
- unloading

After 10mins
- tape levels
- nearest support and resistance 
- reversal pattern or pattern confirmation

1782 2019-04-18 07:01:03 How come any stock which falls is a scam for you? Stocks keep going up and down and this is normal in stock market. I think you need to change your mindset.

resistance when broken. Use the 50-day MA to signal intermediate resistance for declining stocks. This common setting triggers excellent short sales on the daily chart

1819 2019-04-18 06:28:03 Thats how you do it! One must work with a reasonable sized universe of stocks because in the end we are humans and we can only process so much data before buffer-overflow ;-). The art of trading is about knowing what to dissect in detail and what to ignore.

1823 2019-04-18 06:23:18 That’s great news for you. I don’t agree delisting is market manipulation. Cause that would mean listing is also market manipulation. Market (demand) should be independent of the N of exchanges. How many stocks are only listed on one Exchange?
1824 2019-04-18 06:22:54 I'm used to that CoT thing in commodities, but fail to find much use in stock related terms, too misleading. One can have stocks and hedge with index future or speculate w/ future and hedge in VIX future or have some ETFs along the way. That's not real in CoT categories.

1846 2019-04-18 05:57:56 Access to that money, bc it's in the form of stocks or company value. Which also means that they bring money to the country via foreign exchange or producing job opportunities for the country.

1869 2019-04-18 05:35:03 And the trolls they’re hiring can’t have a policy convo anyway. Just harass ppl with goofy arguments. One actually said today that it’s wrong to displace ppl in the industry AND also hurt ppl invested in Ins. Industry stocks. What compassion! But denying care is A-OK.  #M4A
1870 2019-04-18 05:34:59 So, what I’m seeing is that since 2009, we ‘socialized’ the market... cheap/easy money used to buyback shares, rather than investing in growth, thus juicing the market, exploding wealth/income(those paid by stocks)inequality. cool. I feel cheated. Ignorance is bliss they say
1871 2019-04-18 05:34:54 Isn't it funny that when managers outperform it is credited to their skills, brilliance etc...but when they underperform the index becomes the bogeyman: ohh...just a few stocks moved in d index, index construction is faulty, etc etc.
1872 2019-04-18 05:32:00 I agree that it is mostly qol but it's all stuff that helps close out stocks earlier/rack up damage faster so it feels p good at least
1873 2019-04-18 05:30:13 Charlie,
Imagery your tweet creates, would haunt a weaker person for life, I cringed.

More seriously.

American Workers must get  very angry.

Left media now saying Stocks overvalued, so to get Trump they attack economy.

They will hurt 401K's.

1875 2019-04-18 05:29:24 I honestly have not studied this as much...but I don’t think too much of an impact esp from official promoter trading coz they have to report any purchase/sale anyways. 

All operated stocks are anyways run by proxies.
1876 2019-04-18 05:27:12 Totally agree 
US markets won’t drop until rotation to major stocks still running
1877 2019-04-18 05:26:46 Suzlon Energy next target Rs. 9 after Vestas seemed to be finishing off take over by the end of this month. Suzlon Energy currently trading at 7.15. Great deal to buy for big profits in short term.

1879 2019-04-18 05:25:41 The current 25k special is in my mind reasonable. Can wait it out and maybe go as low as 20k or strike it unlucky and hit low stocks of last years model and get nowhere.

1883 2019-04-18 05:23:09 Awesome. I would’ve thought a purity policeman like you would have divested from anything “neoliberal” like that. Tobacco/big oil/aerospace (military) stocks in there as well I suppose? I guess anything to grow the ol’ portfolio while owning the dirty centrists, amirite?

1887 2019-04-18 05:18:02 @cnbcKaren @CNBCJulianna Goodmorning Usually , during the time that stock markets face recession or down trend in earnings of companies , investors turn to fixed income to be away and immune from loss. so when you say there is no appetite for fixed income , positive for stocks!

1990 2019-04-18 04:06:51 It was alright when the market was moving. But stocks in concolidation tend to be very illiquid. Very often I get out because of boredom and the bastard moves soon after
1991 2019-04-18 04:06:34 This is great. Most of the HC CEO compensation is stock based. You can't control these investors. HC and Comm stocks are the most popular with small investors, who are middle aged and into stocks to supplement their shitty pensions and their ever-shrinking future Social Security
1992 2019-04-18 04:06:14 convinced they secretly have some stocks in VPNs, cause no way they didn't think people were going to use them to access other country's netflix when this happens

1995 2019-04-18 04:05:03 Haters have been laughing stocks from the beginning. Critics imo have not and there’s still room for that if purely football is discussed. Let’s see how it goes in the long run. His energy and passing have been good but general play with the ball is still limited.

1998 2019-04-18 04:01:53 Yes I agree. It's been brewing for a while. If you are buying or holding stocks for diversification purposes you should be looking at defensive stocks that are as recession proof as possible

2008 2019-04-18 03:51:54 It would be more rational poetic justice if the threat of ending medical patents was the main reason behind the healthcare stocks falling.

2012 2019-04-18 03:50:06 Now's the time to invest in household bleach stocks: the #RobertKraft massage parlor video will be released. A certain amount of poetic justice in that.

2017 2019-04-18 03:47:12 That's because they over bought all the marijuana stocks a little too late and they don't know what P/E stands for!

2020 2019-04-18 03:46:07 I am actually also buying more $AVAV, $TDOC, and $TTWO. Three stocks are all at great price level. Fool on!
2021 2019-04-18 03:45:49 Have you considered doing less trades but increasing parcel size ?
2022 2019-04-18 03:45:39 
2023 2019-04-18 03:43:18 They thought she used her position to get officials to meet with "One United Bank" & her husband was a director of the bank & also had stocks in the company"Troubled Asset Releif Program" & some officials wrote checks to her for her campaign!
2024 2019-04-18 03:41:29 Strong stocks generally have similar structures.

2072 2019-04-18 03:09:43 What's new. Street pumps and then dumps. Except with a company like $ABMD, the dump is worth picking up for long-term growth oriented investors. I think watching the Fib retracement levels is beneficial for stocks that go parabolic in a short time-frame.
2073 2019-04-18 03:09:14 Yes, this is CFD’s not actual stocks. You are trading what the stock will do, but dont actually own shares of it. Hit me up in dm if you want me to explain it more.
2074 2019-04-18 03:08:17 $CAG was the same way. It's paid off like an ATM.

Stocks like this seem to survive a downturn better as they've been beaten down so bad.

I'm only 30% long. Waiting for the market to collapse any day now.
2075 2019-04-18 03:06:58 Lmao. He said that the gun gets ‘converted’ to full auto even though it’s still 1 round per pull. Plus, bump fire stocks are stupid and hella unpractical and hard to control.

2089 2019-04-18 03:01:30 Since the time of George Washington, supposedly not just yes, but massively declined, but (hear say) supposedly fish stocks rallied from post WWII lows.

2101 2019-04-18 02:56:21 Those healthcare insurance stocks that fell: ask people who use their insurance about times they got denied coverage or hit some cap or have to pay high deductibles. Prevent any room for sympathy.
2102 2019-04-18 02:54:48 A corporation can raise capital by taking loans or selling shares of stocks. This is often done when a company is looking to expand.

2118 2019-04-18 02:38:13 But they are not thriving “here”. They are transient, not resident, and travel long distances constantly. They eat mammals, are not dependent on local salmon stocks for sustenance, and were likely in the harbour because of harbour seals or otters. Or maybe small tourists.

2129 2019-04-18 02:30:27 Yes, but did you notice that the last time the Chinese credit impulse was coming up to this point was July 2015? It didn't exactly "rescue" US stocks the next couple of qtrs though it did create a short-lived pop in Chinese stocks (just like now).
2130 2019-04-18 02:30:00 US stocks ended slightly lower on Wednesday as a drop in healthcare shares overshadowed a string of positive corporate earnings and upbeat economic data from the United States and China. - Money Control
2131 2019-04-18 02:29:57 No one is talking about confiscations. We banned bump stocks and made some law abiding citizens into criminals IF AND ONLY IF they violated the new reg. So what?  That’s how laws work. Keep your guns.  The 2A is secure.

2134 2019-04-18 02:29:30 There are a lot of great community Bank stocks out there that pay a nice dividend. But you also need to look at their Price/book or price/tangible book value to understand their value among peers
2135 2019-04-18 02:28:36 Happy Birthday Tim!!

2136 2019-04-18 02:27:27 I bought 5 Cannabis stocks in the hopes they legalize it and I leave a legacy to my offspring. I always wished one of my ancestors had bought Coca Cola or IBM stock back when they were starting.
2137 2019-04-18 02:26:59 The point was, the pics I showed you from Turkey for eg, and my area, the trees have been there for hundreds of years they are NOT in conflict. And Turkey have planted 4 BILLION in a few years while upping meat & leather. Even importing cattle from Ireland to up stocks

2144 2019-04-18 02:23:33 Quick analysis of stock market (5) -Summary:  IMHO recent market rally over the last 3-4 weeks is fake. The market is propped up by pushing the weak stocks, while insiders are likely selling. The market may be hiding a black hole (based on crashing treasury rates in mid-March).
2145 2019-04-18 02:23:28 Exactly. And no shame in that — cost average monthly into ETFs fantastic way of investing.  Keep 20% for stocks long term You believe in for ex a. La AAPL GOOGL
2146 2019-04-18 02:23:15 I think it's a difficult question, particularly if u have a good amount.  This is due to baking if tezos goes to $20 you make that times your earnings every 3 days of baking.  So it's like a dividend stocks, you hold and keep making more every year.
2147 2019-04-18 02:22:44 Working my butt off today. Found some old data #VIX today. I will post a chart. Its triple confirming my thoughts on stockmarket. As you know I have no money on stocks, but in VIX fund... 

I will post a chart next to explain. #Blockchain #botz  look to be nailing this too
2148 2019-04-18 02:21:01 @RobinhoodApp had a 10 dollar loss today overall but none of my individual stocks dropped enough to lose that amount of money. How is that possible? It happened before trading this morning
2149 2019-04-18 02:20:14 @Market_Machination I wouldn't be able to tell you since I don't mess with individual stocks anymore, jus ETFs, currencies, metals,

2152 2019-04-18 02:17:41 I wish i knew @Ken_mj_stocks but the stock is being pulled down, it wants to hit that gap IMO but once that happens it will take off, I thought it wouldn’t get filled before but looks like it may fill eventually 
2153 2019-04-18 02:16:56 Market seems to be holding it together vs individual stocks... not the best look.
2154 2019-04-18 02:16:00 I’m just getting started shorting. It seems the avg price I pay for locates is about .02/shares. And I don’t scalp so I don’t know about that. Personally I feel more comfortable with higher priced stocks. I like super low priced for going long, but not for shorting.

2158 2019-04-18 02:14:32 Ok busy woman I’m asking you NOW WHAT? Trump and Barr are making laughing stocks out of all of us. It is not OK that they get away with obstructing justice in the light of day and we just have to take it. What are your plans?
2159 2019-04-18 02:14:00 What's a good ratio for stocks, crypto, and property?

2165 2019-04-18 02:11:08 Yes; only for intraday;  whenever there is a significant gap up or down above or below the "Conf."(the 2nd number), the levels will be revised and trading plan needs to follow the revised levels. The file has been shared for individuals to use for their chosen stocks.
2166 2019-04-18 02:10:40 I imagine u were one of those people highly disappointed on election night, after being lied to on election night. And after those dire predictions haven’t come to fruition, stocks tanking, war, etc...

2169 2019-04-18 02:07:32 One could say stocks are dipping in the red.
2170 2019-04-18 02:07:25 Check the stocks and investments of our sitting reps and then get back to us on that.
2171 2019-04-18 02:07:24 Yo @SenSanders @BernieSanders how many healthcare stocks you got? You buying everytime these companies drop? Is this info publicly available? 

Thanks for the dip.. I know you always preaching so I'll buy, you'll go away, I'll sell, you come back and preach, I'll buy rinse repeat
2172 2019-04-18 02:07:16 I agree with him partially. My portfolio is 88% stocks and 12% bonds in 401K and 90/10 in Roth IRA.

2177 2019-04-18 02:03:23 @jimcramer why people are sweating over health care stocks on the basis of Bernie. Whats the chances of him being the president and passing the bill and the GOP approving it. It’s Insane.
2178 2019-04-18 02:03:14 The move was dead ass snatching stocks at 40 this nerf did nothing
2179 2019-04-18 02:02:55 European stocks rose on Wednesday led by gains in auto stocks as a better-than-expected set of data from China assuaged investor concerns about the health of the world’s second-largest economy.
2180 2019-04-18 02:02:54 Stocks are out. Pretty sure Harden owns the Jazz stock.
2181 2019-04-18 02:02:47 Among the embattled healthcare stocks, @Merck & Co dived 6.9%, Abbott Laboratories and Anthem dropped 6.6%, Baxter fell 6.2%, Eli Lilly retreated 5.3%, @Amgen lost 4.7% and Pfizer slid 4.4%.
2182 2019-04-18 02:02:41 There is some 16mm footage mixed in that looks incredible and I selfishly wish they could've done everything on a variety of film stocks.
2183 2019-04-18 02:02:03 How many @JumiaNigeria have $JMIA stocks in the company that actually got vested?
2184 2019-04-18 02:01:37 Agreed. I was in and out today. Almost caught bottom and stopped out on a nice tight yet moving stop due to this stocks volatility. Will continue to watch from the side and make entry if and when necessary!!!
2185 2019-04-18 02:01:33 US stocks mostly fell on Wednesday as the healthcare sector slumped on concerns over the potential adverse impact from future policy changes.
2186 2019-04-18 01:59:16 I wonder if Bernie owns any stocks? Naahhhh, he's not a Wall Street guy. Any offshore investments? Nahhh.  
2187 2019-04-18 01:57:03 Trading Guru and penny stocks in the same sentence?
2188 2019-04-18 01:55:49 I’ve never tried shorting before. What does the broker charge for borrowing? And what’s a good scalp to make it worthwhile? Do you recommend high price or low price stocks for shorting? TIA

2199 2019-04-18 01:49:12 I would not be surprised to find out that  Kolomoysky is making money on this hand over fist already. Ze & Co. stocks likely offered to all of the dark forces, internal Ukrainian as well as external, that are craving to bring Ukraine down.

2205 2019-04-18 01:45:03 How management communicates mistakes is very important. No one is mistake-free - as investors 40% of the stocks we buy underperform the market - and I'd be concerned about any company where shareholder communication doesn't include a candid assessment of mistakes. - Bill Nygren
2206 2019-04-18 01:44:31 The key out of this is the strong conflict of interest.  $nwbo.  Conveniently Golman Sachs was able to exit in 2015 before $nwbo went on a slide. How many stocks go through this is boggling $amrn $weyl $plug $tsla just to name a few
2207 2019-04-18 01:44:19 Picking Avisail Garcia off the White Sox scrap heap was a nice find. Tommy Pham from St. Louis is a clubhouse vet that shows the young guys the way. Penny stocks that in the Rays system are blue chips.

2209 2019-04-18 01:42:34 Here we are in 2019 and we're so proud of the dumpster fire that is BFA. More rep grinding. More demi-God level lore characters becoming fightable bosses. More ignoring feedback. And damn, losing half the value of your stocks in less than a year? That's gotta be a red flag.
2210 2019-04-18 01:42:27 hi harsish, can you please suggest me some good stocks for short to medium term in cash segment.
2211 2019-04-18 01:42:22 I was recently stuck on a CR for $BCB and it was at a premium and the share price has held perfectly since (as you would expect). Sometimes CR's occur just to allow SI's to get a larger chunk without surging the share price too hard in low liquidity stocks.

Anyway, we'll see :)
2212 2019-04-18 01:41:22 let’s invest in these stocks, let’s vacate on these yachts
2213 2019-04-18 01:40:38 Nah, take that monthly fee, put it in growth stocks, and let it sit. You will be much better off. If you have no idea about stocks, follow the major analysts from banks and whatnot. Robinhood even gives you analyst ratings on the stock's page.
2214 2019-04-18 01:40:02 So who’s the moron who held thru all that??? They shouldn’t own stocks if they did b/c they got no sense! There’s stuff I liked last week that I hate now! Do your own homework and quit blaming media clowns for your own laziness
2215 2019-04-18 01:39:38 Isn’t the Swiss central bank top shareholder of Apple and a bunch of US stocks ? That’s just as good as the FED buying stocks or maybe even better.

2218 2019-04-18 01:39:08 This can’t possibly be a bottom.  With stocks rising for four months on vapour volume? Something is seriously wrong here.  Very insightful graph, well done!

2233 2019-04-18 01:29:25 Pot stocks in general are unwinding. First wave is over. Next wave requires better businesses. The bigger companies will not run as such again. Maybe 1 of them.
2234 2019-04-18 01:29:11 I feel like I “should know how to code”, I’ve tried a few times but I feel good about my adobe and 3d programs. Reading stocks would be a wise skill

2236 2019-04-18 01:27:22 makes me so angry, they never think about the fucking stocks
2237 2019-04-18 01:27:17 That’s a lie, fact is that the tax cuts did not benefit the middle class but helped rich companies that are buying stocks not the way it was told it would do! Everyone knows that but trump lies about it
2238 2019-04-18 01:26:10 Thanks for sharing Boss, some similarities there with one of mine, guess this is why we sometimes end up on the same stocks 

It's good to see a few sharing this info for the benefit of all (inc the haters)

2242 2019-04-18 01:22:19 You're allowed to buy and sell stocks.

2244 2019-04-18 01:19:12 We do? If so, then being 100% invested in stocks is a no brainer. But why someone would be in cash during a secular bull market is beyond me. But that's bullish. At the end, everyone will be in stocks. Just like 1999.
2245 2019-04-18 01:19:10 Don't play the penny stocks.

2248 2019-04-18 01:16:39 The @federalreserve ended capitalism 10 years ago when they decided to implement QE and ZIRP in order to elevate asset prices (stocks, houses, etc...) 

This is a major reason for rise in wealth gap.  Asset holders got rich and non asset holders can only dream of assets. 1/

2250 2019-04-18 01:15:49 Message for whoever stocks the snack pantry for @PredsNHL locker room: if you make it out of the first round, don’t buy any green bananas during the second.
2251 2019-04-18 01:15:12 Honestly, I would be highly amused if pot stocks gapped down tomorrow to suck in some shorts and then violently reversed. A girl can dream
2252 2019-04-18 01:15:00 Talking like they are protecting their stocks still @ cnbc it’s not illegal to speak behind someone’s back as long as it is opinion 
2253 2019-04-18 01:14:19 The entry fee was when the money came out of pocket to buy the property.  I should have a right to a property investment that I and my husband worked two jobs each to buy.  You think stocks that are allowed to ride should be seized too.
2254 2019-04-18 01:13:33 Going to get into stocks
2255 2019-04-18 01:11:50 You know it's a near bubble when the OTC stock ZOOM which is unrelated to the upcoming ZOOM IPO goes up 88% today. I guess people are just blinding buying stocks and not even knowing what they are buying  $qqq
2256 2019-04-18 01:10:59 Live betting is like stocks lol that shit dips and if you time it right you get the win
2257 2019-04-18 01:10:00 I wanna learn more about stocks and bonds.
2258 2019-04-18 01:09:54 Listening to my brother from the boot talk to mii (in that lingo) abt them stocks has given mii a sense of cultural joy.. you’d be surprised what these street guys know.
2259 2019-04-18 01:09:53 There are now $1.5 trillion of net free reserves in Federal Reserve member banks many of which are zombie banks. So those free reserves are going into stocks and bonds, not into new loans. Thus the stock market goes exponentially higher, while the economy huffs and puffs along.
2260 2019-04-18 01:09:46 Channingdamus, what kind of stocks should I invest in? (Since you can tell the future...)
2261 2019-04-18 01:09:42 And for every fish we remove - we disturb the natural food chain of sea animals sustenance. Whales, dolphins, seals, sharks ... every sea animal will suffer and be deprived and starve. Polar bears and sea birds also starve. Sea ecology, fish stocks & food chain is collapsing
2262 2019-04-18 01:09:35 Fair is pretty subjective and so is HF. All of these guys are much much faster than you or I on a stocks app or at a foreign exchange store.
2263 2019-04-18 01:09:03 Wow I remember when I started stocks and it exploded to 20c!
2264 2019-04-18 01:07:47 @markminervini Always been curious on this - if your stocks have a significant decrease because of a steep market drop, do you reconsider your stops?  In other words, do external market forces drive your decisions the same as those specific to individual stocks?

Thank you.
2265 2019-04-18 01:07:33 Scalise, where's your righteous indignation for Trump executive orders that override states' rights to regulate pipelines? Do you have stocks in oil & gas or just pocket money? Would you feel the same if you had stocks & bondage on humans or would you call for 2nd Civil War?
2266 2019-04-18 01:07:20 I don't own firearms. I find the concept of unregulated 3D printing refreshingly free. U can do what u want, with and on your own property. 

Time to buy some stocks.
2267 2019-04-18 01:06:22 Yes I think you have to be involved in the trade to get a fill notification which informs the algo that it should do the stuff on the exchange. My understanding is this works by exposing very very thin amounts of volume on stocks.

2273 2019-04-18 00:59:49 Why is cannabis stock Hexo Corp. (HEXO) trading 10% higher today?

  Marijuana News

  Wednesday, 17 April 2019

hexo – The cannabis sector received one of its biggest votes of confidence yet from Wall St. when a top firm initiated coverage on 4 cannabis stocks.Original link.
2274 2019-04-18 00:58:39 Please tell me you're not this clueless.  Ambulance chasers always follow every short report.  Every single one.  And, they rarely, almost never amount to anything.  Anyone who's been around stocks for a minute knows this.  I have a feeling you know this too.
2275 2019-04-18 00:57:45 $KGN - you either smash them or get smashed

If I have top 10 weird stocks, this is definitely in the top 3.
2276 2019-04-18 00:55:52 This is so irresponsible. You are not helping uneducated malaysian to understand whts economy and wht is stocks index.
2277 2019-04-18 00:55:23 Nice pullback to the 10 week.. we’ll see if stocks too new to catch support there
2278 2019-04-18 00:54:22 A cena do pingo doce não foi a pensar no cidadão, foi para escoar  stocks etc.
2279 2019-04-18 00:54:19 "Military style assault rifle" is a made up term. If it meant bump stocks, it's already been dealt with. Liberals use the term to mean.. Semi auto, pistol grip, whatever they want.
2280 2019-04-18 00:54:12 Bump stocks are a perfect example. They were once legal, and now they are illegal and if you own one and refuse to forfeit it; you're now a criminal.
2281 2019-04-18 00:53:39 Oh you can't kill?
Sucks lemme just keep these 3 stocks and rage my guy.
2282 2019-04-18 00:51:31 $XLV $UNH $ANTM $CI $HUM @realDonaldTrump @larry_kudlow Dear President, Private Health Insurance stocks are getting crushed on @SenSanders ‘Medicare for All’ plan fears. Why are you guys so silent ? You want the nations health system to get destabilized ?
2283 2019-04-18 00:51:02 The amount of times I drop stocks/ miss out on kills because of men clubbing and not being able to get my character to do what I want simply because I rest my hands instead practicing movement is infuriating
2284 2019-04-18 00:50:51 majority of stocks are not sold at deep discounts on any market
2285 2019-04-18 00:48:53 Can we see how most of Congress members became millionaires probably investing in stocks based on laws they created.
2286 2019-04-18 00:48:20 $SPY Having a list of 20+ new stocks to watch, from a scanner would only cause me confusion. I'm always open to new trade opportunities and some get my attention, like $C more recently but for the most part I believe it's far better to focus on a few select stocks, that you know!
2287 2019-04-18 00:47:15 I told you this before, since you proposed your latest Medicare for all bill, healthcare and biotech stocks are getting killed...investors are telling you your idea will kill these companies.  Once biotech is dead, who's going to invest in the next wave of new medicine?
2288 2019-04-18 00:47:14 Yes Im sure #TRAITORtrump gets Graft somehow! We have to find out who in #TrumpCrimeSyndicate @GOP MOC his Admin. own stock or have interests in these For Profit Prisons! Sessions did when he was AG! It should be against the law for them to own individual stocks whilw in Govt
2289 2019-04-18 00:47:11 Sell your coal stocks now
2290 2019-04-18 00:44:59 The real loser(s) are you and people like you, David. You believed a lie for more than 3 years. 3 whole years of your life, David, believing that POTUS is an agent of Russia. LMAO!

2291 2019-04-18 00:44:53 look at my pinned its more than stocks
2292 2019-04-18 00:44:52 Apparently you never watched the movie as they were publicly selling stocks in the station, much like these other publicly traded companies.
2293 2019-04-18 00:44:01 why are stocks going up?  listened to global atomic today.  sounds like a no brainer.  have you run numbers on what their profits could be on a per share basis?  JV w Orano?  Taxes sound a bit high however I guess you have to pay to play

2307 2019-04-18 00:34:08 Kind of, all I know is we have lots of Denmark investors who play penny stocks in Canada and most Canadian penny stocks will have a Frankfurt listing and a $OTC listing .. Frankfurt usually is preferred by the retail speculators
2308 2019-04-18 00:33:50 Healthcare dumping will get done soon, if not today. Next in line are food stocks. Chipotle, Starbucks, dominos, Grubhub etc, they will dump them next.

2310 2019-04-18 00:31:38 This clueless person would ask what he did for the economy. His one year tax break is a farce. Thirty dollars a week gets pissed away.  $4000 at the end of the year buys stocks or pays my property tax. We make the economy by our spending.

2312 2019-04-18 00:31:22 from what i hear, $CGC bought the rights to a deal.  i hold my profits in $CRON because i believe a company like MO (one of the best performing stocks ever) will play a big role... they also have IP rights to the work being done with Ginkgo, I am not saying to buy here either

2318 2019-04-18 00:27:53 Word like I get it to an extent like no u shouldn’t treat people as if they’re stocks but at the same time that’s kinda how life works lol ppl always talking about “value” and “reciprocation” and all these things so..
2319 2019-04-18 00:27:46 “Let’s say the day after you bought all your stocks the market has a major correction; your portfolio loses 25% of its value overnight.

2320 2019-04-18 00:27:30 US corporate reporting was benign to mildly positive. Financial stocks are in focus. US Bancorp & BNY Mellon missed analyst estimates, but Morgan Stanley delivered.  The result form E-Trade stood out, beating consensus by around 17%. @MicMcCarthy_CMC

2327 2019-04-18 00:21:50 I find it really cool that a very concentrated multifactor strategy picked essentially the same stocks to short as the fundamental work you did. (A lot of these stocks have been mentioned by Chanos, too.)

Worlds apart - and yet not!
2328 2019-04-18 00:21:48 Same. The competition on the dirt is so great right now I’d take sprints or lates all day over nascar. Heck I’d rather watch hobby stocks than nascar.

2331 2019-04-18 00:20:35 Disappointing. Lets see how DAU stocks perform after elections.
2332 2019-04-18 00:20:25 Australia is very similar with their $AUX exchange .. and the same type of investors who are drawn to 15 cent mining stocks .. par-take in 15 cent weed stocks
2333 2019-04-18 00:20:24 Sharia laws are equal to ISIS, equal to of Islamic republic of Ayatollahs in Occupied Iran. Sharia laws is equal to pain, suffering, torture and death. In sharia laws women are equal to live stocks and have no rights to nothing.

2339 2019-04-18 00:16:48 My mum is so cute, she always stocks the fridge with my favourite food and cooks my favourite dishes in preparation for me coming to visit.
2340 2019-04-18 00:16:14 And over fishing and pollution is a major issue too, great example is the Chesapeake Bay and the Stripper and Oyster populations. They tanked in the 80's before Maryland got hard on regulations they started to recover but now the stocks are on the fall again.
2341 2019-04-18 00:15:15 Encouraged by the fact that my conversations w/ the homies are starting to transition from cars, clothes, and sneakers...to financial literacy, stocks, and credit
2342 2019-04-18 00:15:03 But I‘m also long two stocks...
2343 2019-04-18 00:14:25 @StockRider I still want at least 3 reasons to short. Sentiment like this just makes me look for stocks already rolling over, like UNH.
2344 2019-04-18 00:14:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
2345 2019-04-18 00:13:34 Almost 4/20 but i dont have any stocks omg 
2346 2019-04-18 00:13:15 1) we are for sure already in hell, but melt up insofar as demons will rise from the ground fire and brimstone etc 
2) not only did we get a full week’s notice, the world ends shortly after 4/20 so we have time to buy the dip in weed stocks 1 last time
2347 2019-04-18 00:12:12 At least it's not crocks n socks.  Fuck that noise.  That's just lazy.  Stocks n socks is a choice.  A bold choice.  Like a monocle.  But without the class. 
2348 2019-04-18 00:10:37 Pathetic imbeciles.  Laughing stocks of the world. Only American conservatives do not believe in science and global warming.
