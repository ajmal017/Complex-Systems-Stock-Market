1 2018-02-19 23:58:32 And Obama saved them?  You won’t find the NRA or Republicans supporting bump stocks.  Just keep your wording that and don’t let it wander.
2 2018-02-19 23:58:13 It’s not punishment at all nobody is saying get rid of all guns, just get rid of the high power weaponry and bump stocks and make controls stricter just like in most countries in the world, of course there will still be gun deaths but there will be wayyyyy fewer, guaranteed
3 2018-02-19 23:57:25 The stock market means almost nothing when it comes to the economy. The stock market doesn't tell us about people who don't own stocks, which is most Americans.
4 2018-02-19 23:57:24 Military ‘grade’ weapons? What do you mean by this? Bump stocks were originally invented for disabled people. Liberalized conceal carry has measurable BENEFICIAL effects. How about if we enforced the laws already on the books and law enforcement did it’s job?

9 2018-02-19 23:53:59 Because we MUST do something about this crisis. While the NRA and GOP favor making it easier and easier to buy military-grade weapons, silencers, bump stocks etc and allow people to conceal carry anywhere if they have a license from any state, most Americans want tougher laws.
10 2018-02-19 23:53:52 This country languished in a state of depression the entire 8 years 0bama was in office, his regulation and mandates kept businesses too scared to invest in infrastructure and expansion. All they did was buy back their own stocks and merge with others to offset some costs.
11 2018-02-19 23:53:47 Which one is it? Value stocks (high CF) do well when rates are rising (because of low duration) or same stocks (high CF/div) do poorly because they are a substitute for bonds?
12 2018-02-19 23:53:17 Really on a jag tonight with the “what-about-ism,” aren’t you?! • I’d say banning people younger than 21 from owning any gun, WOULD HAVE STOPPED this shooter, who bought legally. • And banning bump-stocks would have reduced the CARNAGE in Vegas! So shove it!
13 2018-02-19 23:53:16 Yes several have which you know. Why can't we ban bump stocks? Why would anyone need that? Why can't we close gun sales loopholes?

16 2018-02-19 23:51:20 I don’t know. Why don’t you ask the parents of the kids killed by a weapon used to prop up men’s egos and help really crappy hunters feel accomplished.  Bump stocks and ar 15 restrictions seem like worth a try. Not doing anything hasn’t helped a ton. Has it?
17 2018-02-19 23:51:15 Indeed.

38 2018-02-19 23:50:01 Republicans, nothing is better than owning libs, right? So why don’t we ban assault rifles, high capacity mags, bump stocks, etc. And then, when we have just as many mass murders as we do now, you can tell us how you were right all day long. It’ll be the best own ever.
39 2018-02-19 23:49:57 And....bump stocks can go too

41 2018-02-19 23:49:39 I'm an awful shot and bump stocks aren't always effective.  Why can't I have fully automatic weapons?
42 2018-02-19 23:49:21 2/ I forgot 2 mention in article daughter made a killing. It was complete "dumb luck". No idea what she was investing in, stock market already in a bubble, & she got in and out during a big run, in speculative hi-beta stocks. I got her out about 2 months B4 the big drop. 
43 2018-02-19 23:49:08 I think the point being bade is while Irish and Italians assimilated into US culture, assimilation was paid with time, treasure and blood.TPTB push the narrative that peoples of cultures and stocks more divergent from Amerikaners than were the Irish or Italian should be imported.

45 2018-02-19 23:46:28 Sad for all shooting vics Longer tuffer wait time for ALL weapons esp AR rifles. Limit on clips. No bump stocks. No guns w/ M.I.'s. LOCK tight M detector security in all schools. Charges for all who DO NOT report esp OFFICIALS not taking action upon reports. Stop this right NOW!
46 2018-02-19 23:46:25 Ever wonder why, after Los Vegas, when there was such a common sense solution like banning bump stocks put forth in Congress, it hasn’t happened?  Look into NRA lobbying to kill it as that’s what happened.  Why?
47 2018-02-19 23:46:06 All tour stocks are flat for the day #NoDives
48 2018-02-19 23:45:51 What if the Russians are having an influence within the NRA organization? How else can you explain that even though NRA members are in favor of background checks, banning bump stocks, and banning all assault weapons, the NRA is still so powerful for a tiny, one-man operation?
49 2018-02-19 23:45:46 Thats because they suck and there slow.  Google what what they did to ripple and the whole crypto market. At that time is looked like major market  manipulation  crypto died then stock market went up. Now stocks are dying and crypo market slow crawl back up. Isnt my first rodeo.
50 2018-02-19 23:45:17 The home construction and prices in tony parts of LA is incredible. More extreme than mid 2000s. Everyone is “all in” and the “housing never goes down” mindset is back. If we see stocks and bonds melt in a big way then look out below with real estate.
51 2018-02-19 23:44:53 After looking into to more, I can say without a doubt that I oppose automatic weapons and bump stocks. Guns are namely for sport and self defense. No American citizen needs this kind of weapon.
52 2018-02-19 23:44:37 NO MORE BUMP STOCKS AND NO MORE SEMI AUTOMATICS. YES BRING BACK MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTIONS AND PUT METAL DETECTORS IN ALL SCHOOLS. GET RID OF BUMP STOCKS AND SEMI AUTOMATICS NOW ... NOT TOMORROW. TOMORROW MAY BE TOO LATE. WWJD? You know Mike Pence. Children being murdered!!!
53 2018-02-19 23:44:30 In strong markets +ve news stocks r bought & close near their intraday hi. They quite often gap up next day and are a 2 day play. In weaker markets +ve news acts as a distribution event for pro money to sell. Not always, but for me the corro is a good market health indicator.
54 2018-02-19 23:44:22 Really Newt ?!!!
The only people benefiting from this are the folks who own stocks in guns.
Hmmmmmmm
Yes we are completely nuts .
55 2018-02-19 23:43:47 Of course. It’s a lot more difficult to convert an AR-15 to full auto than people think. 

Bump stocks are ridiculous and should be illegal. The rifle itself is just semi-auto.
56 2018-02-19 23:43:15 What if the Russians are having an influence with in the NRA organization? How else can you explain that even though NRA members are in favor of background checks, banning bump stocks, and banning all assault weapons, the NRA is still so powerful for a tiny, one-man operation?
57 2018-02-19 23:43:10 Thufir, you know you’re splitting hairs, but shall we satisfy your pedantic soul by calling them assault-style weapons? Oh don’t forget the bump stocks.
58 2018-02-19 23:43:02 So called assault weapons are not automatic. Automatics were banned in 1939. Bump stocks could have been banned but the ATF under OBAMA didn't do it....
59 2018-02-19 23:43:01 Ban assault type weapons and large capacity magazines. Require enhanced criteria w/all semi automatic guns. You have stricter car laws. Add improvement on criminal background checks, increase age to 21, add three references as a part licensure. Banning bump stocks makes sense too
60 2018-02-19 23:43:01 Nope, if I'm beating you then throw away both my stocks, then guess what?  I played so bad that you won by playing less bad. Therefore you outplayed me technically.
61 2018-02-19 23:42:59 Daily Caller News,  (KENDRA) "Stocks said that both sides of the family attended the baptism, with Schaaf’s brother even attending as the child’s godfather". (and notes that it was scheduled months prior to the actual date) #cryout
62 2018-02-19 23:42:57 Marco Rubio -- we can't ban assault rifles because of the number of them already out there.

Hey, Marco, is that why nothing has been done about bump stocks?  Guess what, Marco, we need to start somewhere.  What is your solution -- allowing ppl to have RPG's?  How about bazookas?
63 2018-02-19 23:42:37 Key List video and List sent to VIP Members. We're ready. #stocks #investing
64 2018-02-19 23:42:35 Shootings will sadly continue until all of you support my innovative idea's that will finally stop the madness. Sorry 2 say, laws, bump stocks, getting rid of AR-15's, will not stop criminals. period! I will continue to be there for all of you. Hope you wake up soon! LOVE 2 ALL
65 2018-02-19 23:42:27 Banning bump stocks wouldn't have stopped the massacre, but maybe only 30 people get killed, instead of 58.
66 2018-02-19 23:42:08 @FoxNews they are called bump-fire stocks. #SpecialReport
67 2018-02-19 23:42:05 Massachusetts has pretty strict laws, too. Just banned bump stocks with jail time for possession. We have NH & VT just to our north (can be in NH from Boston in 35 minutes with light traffic) and they have shitty laws.
68 2018-02-19 23:40:59 This morning on @BloombergTV - Asian stocks set to open lower; we'll get earnings from HSBC and BHP and speak with execs from both companies later today; plus Deutsche slashes investment banking jobs
69 2018-02-19 23:40:46 Surprised @Stocks_68 not on the list too- 3 goals and 6 assists on the weekend!
70 2018-02-19 23:40:17 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
71 2018-02-19 23:40:07 I’m a Democrat. Christian. Presbyterian. Believer in religious freedom for all religions, not just mine. Believe the 2nd amendment can be upheld without the need for weapons like AR 15’s and bump stocks. Who is this “you” audience you are speaking to?
72 2018-02-19 23:40:05 Not enough - - ban assault weapons & bump stocks now. No earthly  reason 4 either outside of military warfare use exists.
73 2018-02-19 23:40:03 Beside pushing for a national healthcare system that provides free mental health services, universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole, and banning semi-automatuc weapons high capacity magazines and bump stocks; you are 100% correct.
74 2018-02-19 23:40:01 And the stocks big-loss number
75 2018-02-19 23:39:37 i have stocks arriving soon, Stratia Liquid Gold, The Ordinary pon ada jugak tp tak banyak mana pon
76 2018-02-19 23:36:50 another imp pt-results from alternate asset class i.e. stocks- In 2008 everyone lost in stock market... so investors moved to property and that peaked by 2012/13 in some countries(Ind/SG/UAE) led by oversupply/govt crackdown but lower int rate has pulled it till now in the west
77 2018-02-19 23:36:44 They talked about banning bump stocks after Vegas… never happened.
78 2018-02-19 23:36:31 You’re not helping ,what makes sense is to ban assault rifles to make illegal bump fire stocks what makes sense is to change the gun laws, what makes sense is look to Australia and Canada on how they did it! What makes sense is never again a child mowed down with a machine gun!
79 2018-02-19 23:36:26 "No man should receive a dollar unless that dollar has been fairly earned. Every dollar received should represent a dollar’s worth of service rendered — not gambling in stocks, but service rendered." - Theodore Roosevelt
80 2018-02-19 23:36:06 Do you think Kevlar piercing bullets that kill cops is your right to have? Bump stocks to make your gun shoot  more quickly?
81 2018-02-19 23:35:03 Wally loves his guns. He nuzzles the muzzles. Strokes the stocks. It’s romantical.
82 2018-02-19 23:34:55 First night in weeks where I don’t have a @Majors_Series or @iRacing endurance race to prepare for.  Dirt street stocks?
83 2018-02-19 23:34:53 Ok makes sense. My understanding is that stocks are tight across most zones so limited potential to ship from Australia. Good to see strong barley prices as we head towards the planting season.
84 2018-02-19 23:34:30 Slaughter isn't the purpose of a car. Regulations are constantly evolving based on studies of how to make cars safer. Not true of guns. But slaughter is the purpose of assault weapons, bump stocks, etc.
85 2018-02-19 23:34:23 - Universal registration
- Universal background checks
- No guns for domestic abusers
- No assault weapons
- No bump stocks
- No high-capacity magazines
- Regulate type & amount of ammo sold
- No private sales
- BIG NO on concealed carry reciprocity act of 2017
86 2018-02-19 23:34:11 While you're reflecting, think hard about dead children & nation of innocents menaced by assault weapons: semi-automatics, large clips, bump stocks. All designed for war, unfit for anything else.
Is YOUR JOB to lead on this, to put American lives ahead of NRA & hobbyists.
87 2018-02-19 23:33:48 Reauth assault weapons ban, add bump stocks, AR-15s with Aussie-style tax incentives for turning in and destroying them, how about that?
88 2018-02-19 23:33:20 Silencers is a misnomer...they are suppressors, and they dont really suppress the sound, as there is still muzzle bang and the crack of the supersonic round.

Bump stocks...I can do the same thing with a rubber band and my belt loop.

Magazine size...that's a Straw man.
89 2018-02-19 23:32:13 Hang on just a second...I just read that CalSTRS (CA State Teachers Retirement System) and many other systems like it are major holders of stocks in most of the major gun manufacturers...that are making weapons that lead to school shootings...WHAT THE ACTUAL CRAP...
90 2018-02-19 23:31:58 Then you shouldn't make baseless claims mate.  Just a few minutes of research would've shown you that NEO is well on their way to being a massive ICO platform and public blockchain.
91 2018-02-19 23:31:44 @johnrobertsFox you just said nothing has happened with bump stocks - not correct. DOJ Sessions legal position is current law makes them illegal. Placed in rulemaking for official interpretation of current gun law. Comment period just closed.
92 2018-02-19 23:31:28 These kids need to call out the members of the congressional second amendment caucus.  Name them to the press.  Call out Thomas Massie’s objection to a ban on bump stocks.  Name each member and let them know that their spots are not as secure in re-election as they think.
93 2018-02-19 23:30:55 Bitch, stick to Smash 4, and losing by 4 stocks
94 2018-02-19 23:30:38 People who leave shopping carts in parking spaces should be fined, jailed, and have vegetables thrown at them while locked in stocks in the middle of a town square
95 2018-02-19 23:30:10 I tried looking last feb. but they no longer have stocks. I wasnt able to check the larger gs25 at myeongdong tho. That’s where i got most of the cards.
96 2018-02-19 23:30:07 Also, investors are chasing international stocks not because they are cheap on some absolute basis but because US is so expensive. Would you recommend an allocation to African farmland till the next financial crisis?
97 2018-02-19 23:29:33 I see you investing in stocks trying to have that over night come up 
98 2018-02-19 23:28:37 @value_stocks well that’s totally worthless, but what’s interesting it got added to the IBD 50
99 2018-02-19 23:27:59 I'm ready for tomorrow  and I expect a lot of bullish stocks
100 2018-02-19 23:27:02 Ultimately, but maybe we start with large scale buyback programs? Maybe we get rid of bump stocks and large capacity magazines and yes, semi automatic assault rifle’s. If you were saying that smaller guns like a .22 can do as much damage, then why have anything more deadly?
101 2018-02-19 23:25:47 And then there's the whole they just ban certain attachments for guns e.g. bump stocks for semi automatic rifles. Sure, a shooting will be less drastic. But then there's still a shooting isn't there.
102 2018-02-19 23:25:25 Explain to me how abt of these infringe on your right to bear arms?

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks
103 2018-02-19 23:24:58 Nice :)
104 2018-02-19 23:24:28 ... well maybe my pot stocks @THCBiomed will start climbing on the stock market now ... ha ha
105 2018-02-19 23:24:22 @realDonaldTrump how much does this US Census Cost?  I am being asked again a total account of all money I have, interest, 401 earning, stocks investment. I want legal help.  I do not want to submit to this harassment! Help please.
106 2018-02-19 23:24:08 Not a voter in your district, but I encourage you to support banks on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks as well as other regulations such as waiting periods, training, permits, taxes. For the HS students that will be voting for you in a few years.
107 2018-02-19 23:24:04 Stocks are based on trend and if we can establish a trend then we can assume the future trends are correct get with it #DM
108 2018-02-19 23:23:48 People still buy bump stocks, magazine rounds with 30 or more per magazine, they were voting to make silencers easier to purchase.  Obviously the current laws are not working, so we need better ones.  Ones that are enforced nationally not state by state.
109 2018-02-19 23:21:45 As dreadful as it may be, wouldn't gun stocks/sales go up because everyone is thinking "Oh my gosh, that could happen here. I better buy a gun to protect myself against these fiends"
110 2018-02-19 23:21:30 No, their quest to make profits for gun mfrs has cost thousands of lives. They won’t ban bump stocks, Kevlar piercing bullets hell, they won’t even allow studies and data to be done and gathered. Yes, the NRA has blood and brain matter on their hands.
111 2018-02-19 23:20:45 Nikolas Cruz - AR15 (17)

Stephen Paddock - 14- AR15s w bump stocks (58)

Adam Lanza - Bushmaster XM-15 (26)

Omar Mateen - Sig MCX semi-auto rifle (49)

James Holmes - Smith & Wesson M&P 15 w 100 round drum magazine (12)

Devin Kelly - AR15 (26)

188 killed.

114 2018-02-19 23:19:48 Do u know what semi auto is? Do you know what bump stocks do? Your tweet says u don't. 

The 2nd Amendment was written in order to give the People a way to adequately defend  against the possibility of a tyrannical government. So that we weren't using "muskets" against full auto.
115 2018-02-19 23:18:35 Bump stocks are legal
116 2018-02-19 23:18:23 All firearms of all actions were once meant for war. All kinds of semi-auto rifles with varying stocks and calibres. Would it be better if the ar 15 had a wooden stock? Would that make it less ready for war?
117 2018-02-19 23:17:53 ATF could have banned bump stocks at any time.  Actually could have prevented them from ever getting on the market in 1st place.  Why didn't they?
118 2018-02-19 23:17:21 Everyone after Vegas shooting was going crazy over bump stocks. Now the next shooter didn’t use a bump stock. Everyone is reactive to each attack rather than being proactive & preventative by being prepared for any monster with any weapon. Beef up security.

121 2018-02-19 23:16:56 Plane crash: Airline stock goes down.
Car defect: Manufacturer's stock goes down.
Food poisoning: Restaurant's stock goes down.
Gun massacre: Gun stocks go up.

This is an anomaly, but it's not an accident. 

The @NRA's business plan is written in blood.
122 2018-02-19 23:15:52 @ethereumproject and other blockchain-based cryptos though (ones which use 'smart contracts'... now this is interesting. 

Way more economically and socially useful than bitcoin. And actually a sort of hybrid of stocks and currency. Which is why Ether will retain value.
123 2018-02-19 23:15:51 The time to "improve the background check system" or limit magazines or ban bump stocks was after Las Vegas. Or Texas. Or New Mexico, or, or, or. You had your chance, GOP, you did nothing. Now sit down and follow the Parkland leadership. #guncontrol

125 2018-02-19 23:14:37 There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.

128 2018-02-19 23:13:03 I don't think the government can even ban the sale of stocks. What a stupid idea.
129 2018-02-19 23:11:41 @SenateGOP Right now is the time to grow a spine and do something about gun control. Minimum age to own a gun = 25.  Ban assault type weapons &  bump stocks with a buy back program for those already sold. We also need comprehensive background checks and a 30 day wait period
130 2018-02-19 23:11:41 Background checks on all weapons, other purchases can require a wait period that are safe...make bump stocks illegal and only for military use only...that's a start
131 2018-02-19 23:10:37 I don’t agree with not allowing AR’s; however, I do agree with the bump stocks.  One more thing. AR’s are not assault rifles, they are Semi-automatic rifles.
132 2018-02-19 23:10:00 No they're not. They are also against bump stocks. Left can't stop with their lies.
133 2018-02-19 23:08:11 Want to improve the situation in a totally reasonable way? Get rid of the gun show loophole in NICS checks and waiting periods. Ban bump stocks and extended magazines. And expand the number of red flags that can get you blocked from firearms purchases in NICS.
134 2018-02-19 23:08:05 RT @TwoHeadlines: Stocks on the Move: Frontier Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:FTR), Harley-Davidson, Inc. (Background checks)

136 2018-02-19 23:08:01 That is perfectly irrelevant. No civilian has a need for firearms (and firearm add-ons, see bump stocks and high capacity mags) designed to kill a lot of humans very fast. Most Americans know this, many are finally had enough of the NRA nonsense. They are going to be banned.

139 2018-02-19 23:07:06 The thing is, though, none of these legal/responsible gun owners would be materially impacted by the inability to own bump stocks, or extended magazines, or to have to go through a waiting period and background check first (even for private sales).
140 2018-02-19 23:06:52 Both Republicans and Democrats supported, extended and made permanent the Bush tax CUTS. Tax BURDENS are much lighter for those who gamble in stocks and real estate than for those who do real productive work for a living.
141 2018-02-19 23:05:48 Just ordered issue 14 henry @MundialMag can't wait for it to arrive! Although the stockists here down under  need updating on the website... Visited 4 in the last week and nobody stocks..... Get these leeches off your pristine list! Email where i could update you guys?
142 2018-02-19 23:04:05 I already want to see a real breakthrough of the stocks. I strongly expect that it will happen this week. 
143 2018-02-19 23:03:52 Hear me out: if a lot of my hunting rifles with wooden stocks are more powerful/equally powerful and accurate than my "assault rifles" and are comparable in ease of use and capacity, why ban one type? Because it looks scary? I honestly don't understand.

145 2018-02-19 23:02:19 and @TomiLahren police officers don't spray crowds with an AR15 or BUMP STOCKS. But I'm sure there's some illogical explanation in your tiny mind.
146 2018-02-19 23:02:02 The federal government should ban bump stocks, high round ammo, assault/assault style weapons. Require background checks with no guns allowed for those with mental illness. This won’t stop all gun violence, but it’s a start.

153 2018-02-19 23:00:20 unfortunately, it isn't doing anything for the stocks. Going to take a lot more proof economic profits are taking hold.
154 2018-02-19 22:59:05 Market corrections are good. But watch for stocks WS overvalues to make profit for institutional investors. e. g.  NVDA
155 2018-02-19 22:58:54 You ignore it is just common sense to make items such as bump stocks illegal as they have no legitimate use.
156 2018-02-19 22:57:12 Saw the talk earlier with Paris and you talked about bump stocks that has been paused by ATF. At least Denver, Co has outlawed them.
157 2018-02-19 22:57:08 The M16 was actually styled after the AR15. Once you bump up the stocks and add ammunition to make it act like it’s fully automatic, it’s essentially an M16.
158 2018-02-19 22:56:36 Wish I could say I was surprised. I don't get it, do these people have gun company stocks?
159 2018-02-19 22:56:15 You apparently either didn't notice why UST long ylds rose when stocks sold off 2 wks ago or didn't wonder why they were...a very gold standard like movement in rates
160 2018-02-19 22:55:40 Well I was considering investing in their company stocks...
161 2018-02-19 22:55:22 Obama didn’t try to fix anything! The NRA wanted bump stocks outlawed & Obama didn’t listen. Obama came to my state of Oregon after a mass school shooting (including the shooters parents), but Obama didn’t once have condolences, just word shaming  about how guns should be banned
162 2018-02-19 22:55:12 We can go state by state to get these laws on the books and followed as law, no more AR15 sells to the public background checks No bump stocks
163 2018-02-19 22:55:06 Switch from a cash ISA into a stocks and shares one and you can get 6.1%
164 2018-02-19 22:55:03 I, for once, agree with the NYT. While an ardent gun advocate, background checks should be required for any gun purchase. Nor should bump stocks be available.
165 2018-02-19 22:53:55 As far as a bump stocks. You can ban them but people will always modify there weapons if needed or wanted. Bump stocks are not that hard to make. So you can't buy them would it have stop the shooter no. No law would have. Name one law you can come up with that would of stop it.
166 2018-02-19 22:53:18 Big shit! Not enough, ban the manufacture of semiautomatic weapons bump stocks & ghost guns. Roll back Brady Bill. There are enough weapons already in the US for everyone already.

168 2018-02-19 22:51:46 It is not a complicated issue, you took NRA $$$ & have done nothing to change the laws and make it harder for people to buy multiple assault rifles as well as prohibit the purchase of bump stocks. Stop making it a political issue. This isn’t Ds vs Rs. It’s about doing something.

170 2018-02-19 22:50:05 @jay_fant AR-15, bump stocks, semi automatic weapons and large magazines are way beyond 'right to bear Arms.' the voters are smart enough to see thru your NRA Lobby rhetoric. #boughtandsold

Blackrock bought up as many gun stocks (financial stocks) as possible.
@SamSeder all this info came from Dan Rather's Monday News show on TYT.
178 2018-02-19 22:47:06 I live in ma. A few weeks ago,licensed gun owners received a letter telling us to turn in our bump stocks because they are now illegal in our state.  I'm just wondering...does anyone know how many were actually turned in?  Asking for a friend...
179 2018-02-19 22:46:57 Nope. Just all automatic, military grade weapons. Leave those for the police and military.
Oh, and you have to make bump stocks illegal as well so you can’t convert other rifles either.
180 2018-02-19 22:46:34 Bump stocks are still legal and they were used in at least the Las Vegas shooting. Seemed like a pretty rapid fire shooting in school videos. But point is that these are mass casualty weapons that civilians have no need for.

185 2018-02-19 22:44:54 Pensa que  a más fácil, ajustar los stocks o los precios ? Si Nadie viene a comprar prendes fuego el stock o si vienen todos juntos lo multiplicas por arte de magia. Más rápido y fácil poner un cartel de REBAJA en la puerta o subir el precio al triple.
186 2018-02-19 22:44:31 It's not going to happen as long as the NRA owns our politicians. We need to go blue in 2018 and stop the sales of AR-15 & bump stocks, there is no reason why someone needs to have these.

191 2018-02-19 22:40:24 Going down. I think some evaporation has taken place when I've been sleeping. Am attempting to deplete stocks at an equal pace but.
192 2018-02-19 22:39:38 As an avid Hunter & gun owner I repeat that the real reason they let the assult rifle law expire & Obama legalizing bump stocks was to further escalate gun crimes so they could use it to take all guns! They gave criminals the weapon of choice. It will ruin it for all if us.
193 2018-02-19 22:38:34 So if you are against bump stocks...why haven't you put forward a bill to outlaw them? Afraid your Blood Money is going to dry up?

195 2018-02-19 22:37:10 Senator Gillibrand - you need a plan on gun terrorism.  1-No Automatic weapons (includes all types of semi and auto), 2-No bump stocks, 3-Background Checks including Gun Shows, 4-No private sales without background check, 5-No sales underage 21, 6-No sales for mentally ill
196 2018-02-19 22:37:03 It also allowed them to be able keep the payroll down so they could afford Cain and Yelich. What I like about tanking, especially in baseball is that stocks the farm system and clears up salary so you can go get the pieces that your farm system is lacking

204 2018-02-19 22:33:15 Congress is talking about bump stocks, not allowing people on no-fly list to buy guns, limiting magazine size, mental health, etc. That stuff can’t even pass. 

There are simply too many guns in circulation. Unless we are talking about confiscating weapons we’ll see little change
205 2018-02-19 22:32:07 That's where the Fed steps in & pins LT ylds at 2.5% like they did from 1942-51.  UST holders got every dime they were promised, but lost 85% v stocks, 75% v CPI

207 2018-02-19 22:29:58 I think it is more about the NRA’s support of military type weapons, bump stocks, large magazine clips, easy and quick access to guns - that is the “spirit” of the chant and anger.
208 2018-02-19 22:29:50 Seriously?! Obviously you DON'T understand where he's coming from! No one is trying to take all your precious guns away! But how about AR-15s? Or bump stocks that can make a weapon automatic?! NO civilian needs these!! Or children have the right to life and safety. Unbelievable.
209 2018-02-19 22:28:48 The AR-15 was developed by Eugene Stoner for advancements in battlefield weaponry. If a weapon was developed purely for intentions of increasing effectiveness on the battlefield, it is military grade. Not to mention the bump stocks, etc.
210 2018-02-19 22:28:08 You know quite well @benshapiro  proponents of gun control R in minority (in Congress) nothing before House taken w/ any seriousness.

You can’t even agree to push a bill immediately to ban bump stocks instead trying to deflect to “they’ll figure something else out”. Why have any law then. Great. Awesome. Bump stocks. Bump stocks.
217 2018-02-19 22:22:31 Most gun owners I have talked to agree that changes need to be made. We have an obsession with guns in the US and too many are on the street. Get rid of AR and bump stocks is a start.

219 2018-02-19 22:22:10 The NRA for one day supported banning Bump Stocks and every politician supported the Ban the the NRA switched and politicians never did anything about the Ban even though 50+
Innocent people died.
220 2018-02-19 22:21:38 because I already have all the EU and Chinese exports I want to buy, and I need to park my USD until my weapons are ready, because the lead times are very long. And I'd much rather have a debt claim on the US govt than Apple stocks. Pari passu rules, you know.
221 2018-02-19 22:21:37 So, just coincidence that largest mass shootings involved an AR-15?
So, it makes sense that Congress never acted on bump stocks that make firearms automatic?
Both of those are just a start on making anyone safer, and not infringing on right to bear more sensible firearms.
222 2018-02-19 22:21:23 Seriously, what part of my support of the 2nd amendment did you miss? Simply put, the general public doesn't need assault rifles, bump stocks in their choices. I think we can agree that our founding fathers could have been called 'terrorists' - let's talk solutions, not excuses~!
223 2018-02-19 22:21:23 I understand you're mad. I'm the NRA. I'm not in the industry. I don't even own gun industry stocks because they're unprofitable. Remington is filing for bankruptcy.

225 2018-02-19 22:18:04 @TheJuanWilliams the reason nothing has been done about the gun stocks since Vegas is because the dems can’t seem to work on anything because they are all working on ruining our president instead of making laws idiot

231 2018-02-19 22:15:51 They are not war weapons and never have been. They are low power rifles with plastic stocks that *resemble* a war weapon. They can be very inexpensive and the ammo is dirt cheap. Thats why 10mil of them are out there
232 2018-02-19 22:15:50 @TheFive Ask Juan why bump stocks failed.  I believe it was from Dem overreaching to get more than just the stocks.
233 2018-02-19 22:15:39 How do you plan to ban "military-style assault rifles." This term refers to cosmetic features like folding stocks and flash suppressors, which can be removed to make the same rifle legal again.

236 2018-02-19 22:14:08 Lebron James ur hater has become ur unwittingly promoter. The millions from far and abroad that didn't kno u know u now. Your stocks have risen. ( figure of speech)
237 2018-02-19 22:13:10 SILVERLIGHT ENTERPRISES stocks slump
238 2018-02-19 22:12:23 Remember after Las Vegas? GOP all over TV, saying they'd support ban on Bump stocks? Which NEVER HAPPENED. Well, they're on TV again, saying they support "reasonable restrictions." WhIch WON'T HAPPEN either- the NRA will let them talk, then quietly remind them they have receipts.
239 2018-02-19 22:12:05 For the record, I’d be perfectly fine with a ban on bump stocks. But do go on
240 2018-02-19 22:11:47 NewsWatch: Dash to cash? The selloff may have created bargains in these stocks
241 2018-02-19 22:11:32 Rep. Dent outlines measures like banning bump stocks that he thinks should be a “no brainier," but adds, “the issue is, will our leadership allow votes?”

Adds, "in this polarized, paralyzed environment, I’m not particularly optimistic" that anything on guns will pass in Congress
242 2018-02-19 22:10:56 True  im actually an 80s baby(85 actually) but i totally agree 
243 2018-02-19 22:10:31 The ST tell will be how stocks react to positive news events. If treated as liquidity events to sell into this market is heading lower. Everyone I'm speaking to is looking for reasons to SELL.
244 2018-02-19 22:10:26 @SenatorBurr 2nd Amendment does not require allowing AR-15's, guns under age 21,   unregulated private sales and gun shows, bump stocks, ineffective  background checks, etc.  EVEN SCALIA SAID THAT!!! ACT NOW!!!
245 2018-02-19 22:10:25 It does NOT mean yahoos with bump stocks and hand grenades.
246 2018-02-19 22:09:37 Ai bka naout of stocks ganun din sa smart, i waited for almost 5 days bgo dineliver haha
247 2018-02-19 22:09:35 If The Guardian says this, it's likely not the product of the troll farm in St. Petersburg, Russia. Ban bump stocks -- no Second Amendment right supports them.
248 2018-02-19 22:08:15 .@RepCharlieDent wants votes on "enhanced background checks" and bump stocks; says the Cornyn-Murphy proposal seems like a "no-brainer" #MTPDaily
249 2018-02-19 22:07:23 There is a huge outcry because so called "conservatives" and @NRA types wont do anything. After #VegasShooting, bump stocks weren't even banned... Since when does our Constitution protect accessories? 

Its time to seek ideas, & you right wing ideologues aren't offering any.
250 2018-02-19 22:07:17 Thank you Randy. I am a Florida resident, and I'm NOT a gun owner. But, I respect the 2nd Amendment, but I agree that no one needs an assault rifle, bump stocks, or tracer bullets.
251 2018-02-19 22:07:14 Free cryptocurrency for all ages 13+ the stocks are rising get in the game now DM me
252 2018-02-19 22:06:56 seriously, Disney is magical and they own everything. Buy stocks now!!
253 2018-02-19 22:06:09 @greggutfeld how do you prevent Las Vegas shooting?  You don’t approve bump stocks for sale because they effectively turn a semiautomatic weapon into a fully automatic weapon. Once again, government failure to regulate & enforce
254 2018-02-19 22:06:07 TRUMP, you are the President now 
 Act like it . Sanction Russia for meddling in our elections , and work to find a way to keep it from happening again.  Gun reform , ban assault riffles, have thorough background checks . no bump stocks , no 30 round clips . Start somewhere .
255 2018-02-19 22:05:35 AR15s and bump stocks are legal, that doesn't mean it's right.
This NEED for assault rifles is not right either. They certainly won't over throw the US govt, as people say is a reason.
256 2018-02-19 22:05:03 If you’re so adamant about citizens being able to defend themselves against what the criminals may get illegally, why don’t you just come out and say you want Bump stocks to remain legal and fully automatic weapons to become legal? What’s the point in making anything illegal?
257 2018-02-19 22:04:52 Yes places like Cabela's and Sporting Goods hit them in the pocket where it hurts and maybe they'll stop selling bump stocks and AR-15 AK-47 type weapons plus large magazines! If we don't do something no one else will especially our spineless GOP Congress. It's up to us people!
258 2018-02-19 22:03:17 What is the problem with finding out if banning assault weapons and bump stocks will help? Everyone keeps speculating but speculation does nothing to help. So many selfish people.  We need a multifaceted approach.
259 2018-02-19 22:01:32 If we had common sense gun laws, ex. no bump stocks; limiting the amount of assault rifles one can “collect,” the amount of human beings killed in mass shootings would be lessened. (Add background checks, waiting periods, mental health checks — can only help to keep us all safe.)
260 2018-02-19 22:01:01 Do you not look at stocks??? They’re better than ever
261 2018-02-19 21:59:10 Don’t forget slavery, corporal punishment, witchcraft trials, beer for breakfast, the stocks.  All of these were popular somewhere or another...and all are lousy ideas.
262 2018-02-19 21:58:46 I'm a gun owner. There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.
263 2018-02-19 21:58:40 @JohnKasich is right, @MaryTaylorOH. We're failing our children. Don't you have a responsibility to keep them safe at school? Assault rifles, large magazines, bump stocks = weapons of mass destruction = slaughter of innocents worse than int'l terrorism.
264 2018-02-19 21:57:53 Poor sweatyboy, he took game 2 and he said afterword that I "destroyed him" game 3 but I think I had 2 stocks, I can't recall lol
265 2018-02-19 21:57:06 @richardquest  Why don't you address the money concerns of ordinary people who live paycheck to paycheck or with limited savings. Most of US don't have a clue about the DOW or a reason to be concerned with the rise and fall of stocks. Why do u speak only to the privileged?
266 2018-02-19 21:56:58 You're a crypto traitor... you should be ashamed. fk #BTC, if these other coins can, and eventually will break this pathetic correlation to the #dinocoin known as BTC, it would likely become the fossil its destined to be.  no one likes a traitor, go trade stocks dude.
267 2018-02-19 21:56:09 Sweet lol.. We're living in a time of opportunity, its a great thing were invested and gaining knowledge about the market. It can be hard to juggle a career and trading crypto but putting the time and effort in will most certainly pay off.
268 2018-02-19 21:55:38 Comparing tulips lmfao. With tulips was there a central tulip banking system threatening to encompass governments? Value is value until it isn’t. A few days ago $NVIDIA was worth 30% more on the stocks, now much lower. It doesn’t store value?
269 2018-02-19 21:54:48 Ban AR 15’s and bump stocks thats the correct action to take. Wtf age limits do nothing to stop killings Idiots
270 2018-02-19 21:54:10 That's great. Keep on learning about your industry. And be open to multiple streams of income. 
How is your experience with stocks so far?
271 2018-02-19 21:53:33 Thank you for the comments.  Antibiotic stocks seem cheap.  Yet, after TTPH, I have been scrutinizing clinical trials more closely.   They failed a previous cUTI trial for eravacycline..choose a different indication.
272 2018-02-19 21:52:52 We'll just arm everybody and then threaten to take their guns away thereby stimulating a huge jump in gun stocks and weapons sales. There will be mass casualties but the money is just so good. Inside the mind of the NRA.
273 2018-02-19 21:52:49 Oh, yes. I'm sure that it's all "fake news" to you. 

Go ahead and send an email to Slide Fire. Request their specs. Go visit a range where you can fire one. Then you can get back to me about how awesome bump stocks are are, and how everyone needs one for "home protection."
274 2018-02-19 21:52:34 That explanation is basically admitting your wrong bc the owner sets the value, not the market or a twitter poll. And a company stocks price is determined by what people are buying it for not what the company decides it’s worth
275 2018-02-19 21:52:27 @GovRickScott you said the FBI director should resign but what about the others? Speaker Ryan has not gotten rid of bump stocks nor AR-15s should he resign? Mitch McConnell hasn't gotten rid of high capacity magazines and AR-15s should he resign? Trump has done nothing 2 help
276 2018-02-19 21:51:59 Bumps stocks help disabled fire a gun. So you want to deny a disabled person their rights? What will waiting period do all these mass shootings had guns for a while.
277 2018-02-19 21:51:33 A pitch invasion? Act like you’ve been there before chaps, you’ve won the bloody thing
278 2018-02-19 21:51:18 3) which I can imagine , ppl love that “cool feature” but we gotta do SOMETHING, I’m guessing if u said would u rather have no gun a all? Or keep the ar15’s but get rid of bump stocks, I’m guessing they’d say to keep it, at least I’d hope so..
279 2018-02-19 21:50:44 @xile737 @MoneyGoose @StewPedidiot @maximilliano I'm even in a couple of small oil and coal penny stocks lol. wouldn't be if a Dem was POTUS
280 2018-02-19 21:50:08 Gold, silver, AI and biotech stocks
281 2018-02-19 21:50:02 2)am I correct?If so,then Id say,there u go thats a good compromise I would say,get rid of the bump stocks,this way mass shootings is less,ppl get to keep their guns,every1 is happy,no?Although I have seen alot of reports that ppl DO get the ar15’s bcuz it CAN fire multiple shots
282 2018-02-19 21:49:51 But.. shotguns not the same as semi-automatic, clips & God forbid, bump stocks ( which make a semi a machine gun)!
283 2018-02-19 21:49:37 @xile737 @MoneyGoose @StewPedidiot @maximilliano in even in a couple of small oil and coal penny stocks lol.I wouldn't be if a Dem was POTUS
284 2018-02-19 21:49:25 ulcer*
285 2018-02-19 21:49:05 @realDonaldTrump Get rid of BUMP STOCKS, AR-15's and better back ground checks.
286 2018-02-19 21:48:49 "Congress wasn't able to end bump stocks". You're correct & it's pathetic.  A simple act, no rational person should oppose. 
We need rational gun regulations.  We need to end the pernicious effects of corporate money on the government of #wethepeople.  Especially #NRABloodMoney
287 2018-02-19 21:47:01 David French’s criteria are impossible to meet in most cases, leaving less than no solution.

Why exactly can’t we ban semi-automatic rifles, large capacity magazines, bump stocks?

Why can’t we track gun violence? Require background checks? Police gun shows?

289 2018-02-19 21:46:50 As a liberal I understand the need for guns. But, can any conservatives here tell me why we NEED bump stocks, 5 minute background checks, gun show loophole, etc.? I don't hear anyone up in arms bc they can't buy a tank, or rocket launcher. Just asking for common sense reform.
290 2018-02-19 21:46:23 But seriously, what kinda ultra high risk penny stock are you going to say you have your whole profile on to show your stocks tripling? I want to see this.
291 2018-02-19 21:46:05 Oh please..Learn something or shut up. Stocks are bought and sold, News and Entertainment channels, FB, Twitter, all tech companies. You want real journalism? Travel and see it, live where it happens. News shows you what they want you to see and then spin the narrative mostly.
292 2018-02-19 21:45:59 1)Ok there you go,that would be a good compromise,cuz as I was researching,alot of ppl call it a machine gun or assault rifle,but it isnt,I read it shoots one bullet but the bump stocks make it semi automatic,which is the problem we have,bcuz thats how they do the most damage
293 2018-02-19 21:45:33 And by the way it's not taking guns away from anyone it (1) making it harder to get / buy assault weapons under 21 and (2) removing the ability to buy bump stocks / these riffles are not for hunting food their for killing and lately if you can not see how bad they are U'r blind.
294 2018-02-19 21:44:47 I think what most people are asking for is that it be made somewhat more difficult to obtain assault rifles, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Would that really be a horrible inconvenience to you?
295 2018-02-19 21:44:30 If REPUBLICAN MAJORITY refuses to act
There fixed it.
This is not "CONGRESS"
this is the Republican majority that has the power. 
Ryan can put bans on bumb stocks, you don't have right to bump stocks, a hobby or "fun with guns".
This is antithesis to a 
WELL
REGULATED
militia.
296 2018-02-19 21:44:26 @DisneyStudios Interesting you own ABC and you keep your so called comedian on the View. Will be selling all Disney stocks tomorrow. Will go to Busch zGardens from now on
297 2018-02-19 21:44:23 If you're just now buying stocks at these prices you are an idiot.
298 2018-02-19 21:44:14 #KFC UK running out of chicken is just an attempt to dissuade Trump from turning up. No bargain bucket for agent  orange. How are the chicken stocks in Russia?
299 2018-02-19 21:43:53 I agree that the paper stocks and visual fidelity of the coloring hurt if you don't have the context to appreciate it.
300 2018-02-19 21:43:14 Russian puppet, ban assault rifles and bump stocks now

302 2018-02-19 21:42:08 regular restraining orders rarely are effective so why do you think this will be effective? ban all assault guns, bump stocks & large clips of amino and make it very difficult to get a gun legally. this might work.
303 2018-02-19 21:42:06 @CNN ban assault rifles and bump stocks now
304 2018-02-19 21:41:48 Ban assault rifles and bump stocks now
305 2018-02-19 21:41:37 Prohibitions don’t work? Sure work in Australia. And machine shops? Other countries don’t have those? I’m shocked! And full auto is tightly regulated here. But bump stocks seem to sell well and how many died in Vegas? And did he use bump stocks? Sure did. Boilerplate arguments
306 2018-02-19 21:41:33 We don’t care about you being misquoted- we care about your lack of action for YEARS. I’m your constituent, I’m registered Republican, and I want a ban on semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks.
307 2018-02-19 21:41:30 How about bump stocks?  The Vegas killer sprayed hundreds of people with one. Still nothing was done. Why?
308 2018-02-19 21:40:52 Okay, but relative to the Florida shooter, 1. he passed a background check; 2. he purchased it more than 48 hours before, and 3. he did not use bump stocks and I don't believe he used high capacity magazines.  

I'm happy to see specifics, though.

310 2018-02-19 21:39:53 Not true: Converse was able to end bump stocks, they chose not to.
311 2018-02-19 21:39:52 @Oprah can you help ban assault rifles and bump stocks? You've done a lot of great things can you help with #BanAR15 #GunLawsNOW #guncontrol ?
312 2018-02-19 21:37:41 R so ignorant Trump is making American a priority my stocks have tripled
313 2018-02-19 21:37:25 The same time was true at my high school, virtually every truck had a gun rack with a rifle in it, the shop teacher even helped students refinish the stocks. Number of students shot 0 Number of guns in school (other than shop class) 0
314 2018-02-19 21:36:42 Mr. Ken Fisher is 100% right about avoiding Annuities!  Set up your own personal Annuity by owning good Dividend Stocks!
315 2018-02-19 21:36:08 My Congressman, Jeff Duncan, 3rd district of South Carolina has legislation to approve MORE BUMP STOCKS....in the NRA'S POCKET....he doesn't get my vote...EVER..@GOP
316 2018-02-19 21:35:28 $GS Goldman Sachs sees red ink everywhere, warns US spending could push up rates and debt levels.

Hmm? Win win!
317 2018-02-19 21:35:21 Yeah price shot up because some manufacturers went nuts on them and drained stocks, if I remember well. Should be fine soon enough though
318 2018-02-19 21:35:11 @JJWatt you did a great thing raising money for Houston. Can you help ban assault rifles and bump stocks? Thanks #BanAR15 #GunLawsNOW #GunContolNow
319 2018-02-19 21:35:07 It's more than background checks @realDonaldTrump-or should we call you the $30,000,000 NRA Man. Semi-Automatic and Automatic Long Barrels-gone. Bump Stocks-Gone. Protect the people of the nation-don't line your wallet with the blood of innocents. #Resist
320 2018-02-19 21:35:05 The Vegas shooter had to conceal those rifles to get them into his room, so increasing the length would have made it more likely for him to be caught. Bump stocks should also be banned, and conversion kits.
321 2018-02-19 21:35:03 I remain hopeful and seeing Trump appear to make progress toward some gun control reform is encouraging. Congress wasn't able to end bump stocks but something is different when high school students that just survived a school shooting are demanding change now.
322 2018-02-19 21:33:38 You got it wrong, as usual, Obama was the most divisive president in history. Obama turned us into laughing stocks keep drinking the koolaid
323 2018-02-19 21:33:04 And the fact that bump stocks aren’t illegal only makes those bigger guns more destructive. I’m sure majority of people aren’t crazy and go shoot up schools, but still, there’s no point to having a gun capable of that much mass destruction
324 2018-02-19 21:33:02 Darlin' IF you are from Venezuela, which I doubt, stay there. WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN COUNTRY.  We are NOT talking about taking ANYONES TOTAL GUNS AWAY. We are saving our CHILDREN. We can now kill more children quicker w/bump stocks and semi automatics. THAT has to stop.
325 2018-02-19 21:32:51 What will help more is background checks, denying guns to those mentally unfit (revoked by 45*), denying guns to domestic abusers, those on the no fly list and banning bump stocks and assault weapons.
326 2018-02-19 21:32:16 @KingJames would you use  your influence to help ban assault rifles and bump stocks? #BanAR15 #GunLawsNOW #guncontrol

344 2018-02-19 21:22:37 Common sense gun legislation: universal background checks, magazine limits, mandatory minimum waiting periods, mandatory liability insurance per gun, lift cdc restrictions on studying, ban bump stocks.
345 2018-02-19 21:22:28 Hell, you mentioned bump stocks lol. A bump stock never killed a single person....but you love buzzwords so you had to throw that in there lol. You told on yourself...you’re completely ignorant to the talking points you’re tripping over
346 2018-02-19 21:22:08 Exactly. So banning them in the first place is pointless. Banning bump stocks I am good with. Biggest thing in my mind is fixing the background check database and dealing with mental health issues.
347 2018-02-19 21:21:40 Woefully insufficient, just 1 tiny step. Ban assault rifles, bump stocks, big ammo clips, increase wait period, state of the art gun reg sys

351 2018-02-19 21:18:44 I agree with the exception of #3 is rather hard to define. Bump stocks are pointless but when trying to legislate "military style assault rifles" you end up with definitions that boil down to "it's skeery lookin'".

358 2018-02-19 21:17:41 Why are bump stocks legal
359 2018-02-19 21:17:04 Massachusetts made a law recently that bans bump stocks.  Owners were supposed to turn their's in.  ZERO were returned.

372 2018-02-19 21:10:36 I know about bump stocks, and I know about guns. I have them, I use them all the time. Bump stocks are not easy to use, not something you throw on and automatically become a killing machine. Only 1 shooter has ever used it, stop fear mongering.

380 2018-02-19 21:07:48 You are both correct in two senses. January most likely did mark top in stocks (though there’s no certainty, just game changer of return of volatility which historically coincides with tops). And, no we never did hit bear, which is indeed a 20% decline.

399 2018-02-19 21:01:52 Now semi-automatics are used for big hunting such as caribou, elk, moose and other big game animals. Police also use semi-auto for swat and other situations as well. There is a grey line with bump stocks anything that modifies a gun to make it fully automatic is illegal.
400 2018-02-19 21:01:42 There is a 'Presidents Day' sale on bump stocks, the device the Las Vegas shooter used. Slide Fire Solutions, a bump stocks manufacturer, is offering 10% off with the coupon code MAGA. #Trump has responded to the deadly massacres by continuing to oppose any new gun control laws.

405 2018-02-19 20:59:29 With a troubled past cannot just walk into a gun store ans easily purchase a semi-automatic rifle. I would like Bump Stocks and large capacity magazines be outlawed. Then based upon the congressional investigation we either draft new laws or refine existing laws.

Quotas protect fish stocks by artificially inducing a shortage. Same with all shared resources like 3D space. Prevents a tradgegy of the commons.
408 2018-02-19 20:57:18 Easy. Cops should be trained to use their guns only when necessary. If someone is unarmed, it's not necessary.

A 19 year old with history of mental disturbances should not be able to buy a full auto assault rifle with bump stocks and use it on high school students.

Explained.
409 2018-02-19 20:55:54 To be honest, these probably were sold from Russia to Salah from left over Soviet stocks, just like so many were sold as parts kits to the States in the 1990s and 2000s.

423 2018-02-19 20:47:40 Technically speaking, the AR-15 is not an assault rifle. It is not capable of selective fire (choosing between auto or semi auto) which is why bump stocks are such a big deal.
424 2018-02-19 20:47:06 @BarackObama we miss you President Obama. Can you help ban assault rifles and bump stocks? #BanAR15 #GunControlNow #GunReformNow #PresidentsDay
425 2018-02-19 20:46:48 Pistol grips and folding stocks are not the key enablers of mass shootings. Semi-automatic operation and detachable magazines are. The term assault rifle and attempts to ban the features thereof draws attention away from features that would actually make a difference.

438 2018-02-19 20:43:07 #tweetrepeat @NRA You are drawing the wrong line in the sand. Instead of taking the position that bump stocks and AR-15s are  American's Second Amendment Rights, take a stand to support common sense. Lobby to make NEW sales illegal and to enhance background checks. A PAST MEMBER.
439 2018-02-19 20:42:58 Ban assault rifles and bump stocks now
440 2018-02-19 20:42:51 Agreed but it's a common misconception that AR-15's are automatic
However a common attachment, bump stocks, makes them pretty much automatic 

But the GOP is pushing to keep those from becoming illegal 

And these bump stocks have been used in multiple mass shootings
441 2018-02-19 20:42:44 Bump stocks. So yes. Read more.

446 2018-02-19 20:42:13 Can we also throw in bump stocks & reinstating the assault weapons ban?  Would make  90% of Americans happy.
447 2018-02-19 20:41:34 Bump stocks have apparently been used in one mass shooting.

One.

I’m not sure this is crisis level. To be honest, I had never even heard of them before Vegas, and nearly all of my friends and family own guns. They seem pretty rare.
448 2018-02-19 20:40:48 Bump stocks are not illegal,

Ban the weapons that can be modified.

452 2018-02-19 20:38:30 Ok, am I dumb to think we can still have “our guns and shoot them too”? Seems to me we need to ban/limit bump stocks. Can’t buy certain weapons up to a certain caliber until a certain age (21 possibly); limit/ban magazines above certain amount of rounds. Can’t be all or nothing.
453 2018-02-19 20:38:20 How about they "consider" banning assault type weapons outright, Bump Stocks, Extended Magazines and the NRA from funding elections?

459 2018-02-19 20:34:00 The discussion is about limiting assault style rifles not taking people’s guns away or trashing constitutional rights. We have outlawed fully automatic weapons and sawed off shotguns, why can’t we reinstate a ban on automatic rifles (and bump stocks)? BTW I am a gun owner.
460 2018-02-19 20:33:30 Stocks, cryptocurrency..... all I’m focused on! 

Six figures by end of year. Bet?!
461 2018-02-19 20:32:47 Australia's registry has been enormously successful. Stop your BS-"be specific". They didn't even debate banning bump stocks and mag capacity limits after Vegas, because GOP controls Congress and is owned by the NRA. That should have been easy. You guys and your slippery slopes
462 2018-02-19 20:31:53 Nor are bump stocks allowed at NRA's HQ shooting range (if I remember correctly)
463 2018-02-19 20:31:09 GUN Ban modifications on the gun and things like bump stocks, mandate gunlocks (fingerprint recognition?) PERSON National database for background checks for any selling, period. Insurance with lower fees for safety attachments, locks, etc. Training with tests every few years.
464 2018-02-19 20:30:22 Let’s see.... ban bump stocks?   If someone has a legitimate need for one, I might have missed it.  #youreadisingenuousass
465 2018-02-19 20:30:08 This is excellent news. How’s the whisky stocks?
466 2018-02-19 20:30:02 1 is great if they include, all health records & criminal records, including juvenile 2 is fine, 3 isn't our best action (rifles <3% of gun deaths), but no prob with 10 rd mags & no bump stocks. How about making illegal firearm possession a federal crime w/ mandatory mins?
467 2018-02-19 20:29:48 Has there been anything purposed about bump stocks?
468 2018-02-19 20:29:39 Raise the minimum age for gun ownership, ban bump stocks.
469 2018-02-19 20:28:42 Ban Bump stocks. Would make it harder for shooters like Las Vegas.
470 2018-02-19 20:27:38 Hunting and eating what you kill is far more humane than factory farmed meat. One of my best friends from college has a deer feeder in his backyard.

He has stocks of venison, squirrel, etc in a fridge. I enjoy eating meats, esp exotic meats, but I try to not eat meat daily.

472 2018-02-19 20:26:29 Yet, the vast majority of his weapons and the bump stocks turning them into automatic weapons were purchased completely legally.
473 2018-02-19 20:26:02 Hi Chris, I found 1 store that stocks the Chicken Pad Thai. It's not in Swindon but it's the closest store to Swindon that stocks what you're looking for. 1/3
474 2018-02-19 20:25:45 Beefed up background checks; single, mandatory registered national database for all pistols and semi-automatic.  Felony or punishment for guns that end up "lost" or "stolen". Straight up ban on AR-15 and that class of gun, bump stocks, etc. Start there and negotiate as needed.
475 2018-02-19 20:25:26 Fully automatic weapons are. Semi-automatic weapons are not. But they fire as fast as you can pull the trigger, and when paired with bump stocks (a la Vegas shooter) then they may as well be automatic.
476 2018-02-19 20:24:54 AR 15's? Bump stocks?
477 2018-02-19 20:24:35 We have had a great couple of days here at JDM. After key personal meeting we have decided to make some enhancements. We are expanding our trading to bring on small cap trading, undervalued stocks for long term holds as well as swing trading.
478 2018-02-19 20:24:24 Yes, it was a purchased firearm. However, the definition outlined in the 1994 ban is constructed by politicians who have no idea how firearms work. Cosmetic add-ons like pistol grips, flash suppressors and folding stocks do not make a firearm an "assault weapon".
479 2018-02-19 20:24:09 Gypsohila Covent Garden and Candytuft are quickest to bloom along with stocks #britishflowers
480 2018-02-19 20:23:42 There's no doubt in my mind that we should:
1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

484 2018-02-19 20:20:37 muj osobní benchmark je @EAM_Top_Stocks
485 2018-02-19 20:20:36 Bump stocks and rifles that are easily modifiable to accept them are not covered by the ban. There is no good reason to own a bump stock since they reduce reliability and accuracy. But they allow a gunman in Las Vegas to empty magazines into a crowd and kill 60 + injure hundreds.
486 2018-02-19 20:20:19 You have no idea what’s going to happen. We’re fed up. Fed up with your attitude. You’d rather keep your excessive guns and bump stocks than stop mass murders. Do you know how deranged that makes you?
487 2018-02-19 20:19:47 Those who do not pass a background check, should NOT be allowed to purchase firearms.Semi automatic weapons, bump stocks,  springs, silencers, etc, have got to be totally absolutely, #banned from the public.
Assault "rifles" are actually tactical weapons.They are not guns.
488 2018-02-19 20:19:20 No ONE is calling for a "gun free" U.S. - 'gun-free' zones are for schools and warn violators of harsh fines/penalties - grow up and stop calling people you disagree with 'Nazis' #SaneGunLaws (like ban on automatic weapons, bump stocks, and required permits)
489 2018-02-19 20:19:15 Who Know About Stocks & Bonds I Need Help DM ME 
490 2018-02-19 20:18:53 Gosh you’re all being so harsh on Republican politicians. Remember when they acted after Sandy Hook? Or the Pulse night club? Or the time they made bump-stocks illegal? #sarcasm
491 2018-02-19 20:18:34 To that I agree. AR15 is a fun rifle to shoot but for hunting it’s not the rifle of choice except for people.  Bump stocks (Las Vegas) have no place anywhere, ever. The AR15 AK47 can be outlawed as far as I’m concerned but mental health is the issue.
492 2018-02-19 20:17:48 Been playing around with returns, problem is the only Fund I know that tracks the sin stocks has a 1.5% expense ratio deteriorating its return over time
493 2018-02-19 20:17:37 GSW just not in play for me as no borrow. Also no way I’m going to buy weak stocks like that- just what works for me
494 2018-02-19 20:17:27 Do something @SpeakerRyan Do something @realDonaldTrump the site of our children in coffins is sickening, Make American Children Safe Again. Stop with the thoughts and prayers and do something. Here's one idea no one can buy a gun under 21 years of age? How about no bump stocks?
495 2018-02-19 20:17:20 If i find any bump stocks laying around where do i turn them in? And by your definition of bump stocks i mean twigs, pencils, markers, fingers,belt loops, and any number of things found on youtube people use to bump fire a gun
496 2018-02-19 20:17:19 It reminds me when they were worried about very low cod stocks, and the angle the media took was all about fish and chips. Never mind the damage mankind is doing.

498 2018-02-19 20:16:08 Jobs trend has only continued since the previous administration. The stock market only benefits the wealthy and those with the means to own stocks, which leaves many middle and about all lower class out in the cold. Millionaires & shareholders see their dividends, we get nothing.
499 2018-02-19 20:15:41 Mandatory background checks (no waivers for results taking > (x) days).
Nationwide database incl violent crimes, restraining orders, etc.
Minimum waiting periods, based on weapon type.
Registration of weapons & ammo.
Ban high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc.
    (end/)
500 2018-02-19 20:15:07 
Universal Background Checks 
Ban Bump Stocks 
Ban Assault Weapons
501 2018-02-19 20:14:09 Tim's remake should be either Welcome to the Jungle or Enter the Sandman. (Welcome to the Jungle, stocks are everywhere. Be careful of the picks you make or your out in you underwear)
502 2018-02-19 20:13:59 These types of weapons have one purpose, to hunt people. Ban the manufacture of them, no bump stocks or ghost guns.
503 2018-02-19 20:13:45 Yeah, there would be a period of decline in cattle raising, stocks would stop being replenished and they will decease to hobby farm levels. Maybe some end up transitioning to wild animals, over a few generations.
504 2018-02-19 20:12:55 yes don't think the supermarket stocks that range ...
505 2018-02-19 20:12:19 We need to start putting criminals in "stocks" in public and letting Justice be Served!

510 2018-02-19 20:10:28 @realDonaldTrump you said you would ban bump stocks. You did nothing!
511 2018-02-19 20:10:23 No civilians should be able to buy Semi Auto Weapons. Period.
And, (Jesus wept!), after Las Vegas, bump stocks should already be illegal right damn now.
512 2018-02-19 20:10:04 You'll recall he also said he was going to do something about "bump stocks" after the #LasVegasShooting and, nothing happened. #QuelSurprise
513 2018-02-19 20:10:02 In real terms stocks lose value (see tobin’s q in 1970s). But compared to other assets, they do fine. Buying TIPS is the way to go (I think)

515 2018-02-19 20:09:46 Thanks for sharing! This was your first post? Did you have an "about me" or something as well? Also totally looking into Div stocks this year. So much to learn.
516 2018-02-19 20:09:26 Fully automatic weapons are illegal. Bump stocks make semi-automatic weapons fully automatic. Therefore, bump stocks should be illegal. #GunReformNow
517 2018-02-19 20:09:21 We must 1) Require universal comprehensive background checks for ALL sales/transfers of ALL firearms 2) Mandate a 7 day waiting period for ALL purchases 3)Ban the sale of ALL military-style assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc. END this MADNESS-SAVE lives!!!
518 2018-02-19 20:08:40 @jimcramer what stocks would you recommend for someone starting to invest in the market? thanks
519 2018-02-19 20:07:27 Cool. Small government GOP, amirite? Adding 450.000 to the federal payroll and buying their gear, while currently many schools are without heat and teachers buy their own pencils. But man, those arms manufacturers stocks will sure go up, so NRA gets even more $.
520 2018-02-19 20:07:17 Bump stocks are devices created for the express purpose of circumventing the law
  Ban them.
521 2018-02-19 20:06:56 As does automatic fire, which is why 2A types accept restrictions on full auto. Bump stocks effectively get around status quo as accepted by both sides.
522 2018-02-19 20:06:08 Last week the #SP500 posted its biggest weekly gain since 2013! The bull continues to plow ahead! #stocks #StockMarket #markets #DowJones #NASDAQ #SP500 #investment #investors #investing #economics #DJIA
523 2018-02-19 20:05:23 I am a gun owner and I think we should ban bump stocks.  These are devices created for the express purpose of circumventing the law.

When car companies pull shit like that, we fine them 4 billion dollars.

Nobody died because of VW's "defeat devices."
524 2018-02-19 20:05:17 Tal;k about a fail for an answer.  How much you wanna bet that no MM ever steps up and files a Form 211, in an attempt to get any of the three stocks off the grey market?
525 2018-02-19 20:04:33 Seems like Buffett is pumping some stocks (which he owns) and dumping others (which he's sold). Doesn't the SEC have a web site for reporting price manipulation?
526 2018-02-19 20:04:04 I noticed jnk/hyg hard rally.  Usually leading direction of stocks.  Curious since I think red comes this week in spx
527 2018-02-19 20:03:47 Hopefully our gold stocks can head North instead of South, they have been laggards.

530 2018-02-19 20:02:12 Randy: Serious question. Would you permit assault-style weapons and bump stocks, but only with a Class III license? That might be more doable than an outright ban.
531 2018-02-19 20:01:54 David... Laws, politics, bump stocks, etc....will not stop gun violence... WE need to make guns smarter than criminals... I have a solution to do that, but "WE" need help to make this happen... I believe - with 20 "A" List supporters + you kids helping... we can "GIT ER DONE"

536 2018-02-19 20:00:09 I am a gun owner too and I agree with all of that.  Plus increase legal purchasing age to 21 and absolutely do NOT relax laws on obtaining silencers.  I think they should be banned too along with bump stocks.
537 2018-02-19 19:59:23 I agree! No bump stocks, but just as people abuse their driving privileges, and prescription drugs, there will be criminals that break the safety regulations. However, the VAST majority of people adhere to the rules associated with potentially harmful items.
538 2018-02-19 19:58:24 You have a weird world view.

The guy gives away stocks and cash to do good, & I'm sure he's doing it for tax write offs 

Bill's foundations are working on wiping out diseases that afflict the world. He also gives $500 million a year to the United States for education funding.
539 2018-02-19 19:57:29 Everyday I dread watching my son walk out the door to go to high school! I fear he won’t leave there alive. We need metal detectors, stricter back ground checks and bans on bump stocks and Assault weapons! Prayers aren’t working. Excuses are killing our children!
540 2018-02-19 19:57:00 Should be in stocks on the public square for 2 weeks, then get out the rope. More humane than what this monster did.
541 2018-02-19 19:56:50 Yeah right now I'm looking at stocks that will do well after a reset. I do think I will load up on IBM and Overstock when it happens. They are very invested in blockchain.
542 2018-02-19 19:54:31 You’ve only lost money if you’ve sold for a loss. The kinds of people (most of, at least) who dabble with stocks with a pps like bvtk have nearly no tolerance with patience. The big boys know that a year down the road, most will have given up. = more shares for them.
543 2018-02-19 19:53:16 He was open to limiting bump stocks too....
544 2018-02-19 19:52:26 Very excited to be on @TwoShotPod  on Thursday, I'm talking all about my early life all the way through to @actorawareness give it a listen.

549 2018-02-19 19:51:20 After the dot com crash, people said "had I bought beer instead of X stock, I would've made more from the can deposit returns than my stocks, in addition to enjoying the beer."
550 2018-02-19 19:51:05 1. Yes gun sales over the Internet should require full background checks.
2. I don't see the point of bump stocks. I'd ban them. 
3. No. If you can fight in a war for this country you shouldn't be restricted in other areas. Make the legal age 21 or 18 but be consistent.
551 2018-02-19 19:50:38 These aren't just homicides, they're mass murders. Whole different ball game.
We don't need combat weapons in civilian life. Bump stocks and plans to build a Gatling gun online. 100 round magazines for deer hunting?
552 2018-02-19 19:49:57 @zerohedge Insiders sell there stocks  in Facebook, tesla ,whatsapp , netflix and twitter.....
553 2018-02-19 19:46:29 They have not bribed me ..just robbed me  time after time and then claim we should all buy stocks and our house means savers are not poorer ...poppycock
554 2018-02-19 19:44:46 Yes. A few tech stocks will be booming this week 
555 2018-02-19 19:41:46 For the Vegas shooter, laws about creating arsenals and/or bans on bump stocks would have helped considerably with the death toll. More human beings would be alive today with some simple laws that do not infringe on our rights.
556 2018-02-19 19:41:35 JUST MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET RID OF THE BUMP STOCKS BECAUSE WE DONT NEED THEM.
557 2018-02-19 19:41:25 Sinon vous avez encore des mugs en stocks ?? 
558 2018-02-19 19:41:20 Haha, don’t “sin stocks” already provided a higher rate of return?
559 2018-02-19 19:41:20 So.  This Thursday is an interesting one.  We welcome someone who decided, because the doors seemed closed, to start something himself.  This week we welcome Tom Stocks talking all things & @actorawareness 
560 2018-02-19 19:41:02 CAPM analysis done for stocks?
561 2018-02-19 19:40:16 I'm a gun owner. There's no doubt in my mind that we should:

1) Require universal background checks
2) Mandate a 48 hour waiting period for purchases
3) Ban military-style assault rifles, along with accessories like high-capacity magazines and bump stocks

This is common sense.
562 2018-02-19 19:38:21 Bump stocks were used in just one spree shooting. Just be honest and say truthfully that your long-term goal is a gun-free society.
563 2018-02-19 19:38:09 Ok, let's have a civil conversation Dana.  Are you for or against: 1. Bump stocks being outlawed 2. Universal background checks? 3. Sales to people on terrorist list 4. Sales to those with mental issues  How does the above impact law abiding gun owners?
564 2018-02-19 19:37:36 Wondering how many of our 401K and 403B accounts have stocks in the gun industry? We have to be responsible in all we do and search underneath to make sure our investments are ethical, positive. @SenWarren
565 2018-02-19 19:37:22 The NRA agreed to ban bum stocks....which is the only way to sort of make a gun act semi automatic. They support that! Why don't you?!?
566 2018-02-19 19:37:19 "Common Sense" is dependant on the perception of others. You run into problems when you start adding liberal ideas to the already mutually agreed upon "common sense" ideas... across the board background checks and bans on devices meant to turn semi into fully auto (bump stocks.)
567 2018-02-19 19:36:53 Sometimes I lay back and I wish that I invested in good stocks
568 2018-02-19 19:35:44 If I were to buy a gun I wouldn’t mind having to take shooting lessons, or wait for a background check. Nor would I care if I had to get a mental health check. More importantly, I wouldn’t need an AR15 to protect my family or home, or to hunt. Oh & Ban Bump Stocks #GunControlNow

573 2018-02-19 19:34:41 Education funding is cut so who’s gonna pay for all these metal detectors, fencing and security personnel? How about banning assault weapons and bump stocks?
574 2018-02-19 19:33:37 Just an FYI, if you have stocks, H&R Block charges $300 per form to file with your returns
575 2018-02-19 19:33:37 GET RID OF THE BUMP STOCKS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,  THEY ARE THE WORST AND NO ONE NEEDS THEM.
576 2018-02-19 19:32:45 I don't believe banning assault rifles will change anything. Assault rifle is a cosmetic distinction. Banning bump stocks is fine but they are fairly simple to make.
577 2018-02-19 19:32:43 I agree that bump stocks and such should be illegal, but you aren't really addressing the main issue with that. The truth is...semi auto handguns and shotguns kill way more people per year than AR15s. If your main goal is to reduce gun deaths..then ban all guns.
578 2018-02-19 19:32:14 @realDonaldTrump I'm a conservative, registered Republican for 30 years. I also am a big Trump Supporter. I am pro 2nd amendment. Get rid of the ARs and bump stocks. Use your head. Don't screw this up.
579 2018-02-19 19:31:56 Universal background checks, ban bump stocks, limit or ban assault weapons like AR15, close gun show loop hole, raise age limits to buying, encourage red flag laws, increase mental health spending and school resources to help children before they kill, etc, etc
580 2018-02-19 19:31:22 Would LOVE to see them ALL back for a first full season @dirtydc13 2nd 3rd & 4the for others #brillianttogether #peskyflyers @FifeFlyers 
581 2018-02-19 19:30:59 I have never said I advocated a gun ban.  I ban on AR15s and bump stocks doesn’t not a gun ban make.  Nor does passing a federal gun restraining order law to try to help alleviate the problem with mental health and gun ownership. The 2nd is not threatened by these.
582 2018-02-19 19:30:38 We can stop selling assault rifles to civilians and ban bump stocks and other similar accessories.
583 2018-02-19 19:30:09 My retirement account (403B) has been safe for a while with no stocks. There is currently no safe stock near a market top; no way.

585 2018-02-19 19:30:03 And yet, people are still able to buy bump stocks to juice that bullets per minute even more. Well done GOP.
586 2018-02-19 19:28:12 When did I ever say Im unwilling to budge/compromise? You've no clue what my views are, u just assumed. I think BG checks should be given more than 3 days if needed, mentally ill = no gun, poss raise age limit, huge changes to school security, no bump stocks, etc. Still inhumane?
587 2018-02-19 19:27:37 That would be a no. They must all own gun stocks.
588 2018-02-19 19:27:24 &finally the most important, &rarest, trait of all: The ability to live through volatility w/o changing your investment thought process. This is almost impossible for most people to do; when the chips r down they have a terrible time not selling their stocks at a loss.

589 2018-02-19 19:27:02 Why are the Blaming the GOP when the Left had the House and Senate under Obama and they did nothing! Obama managed to legalize BUMP Stocks tho. Unfrickenbelieveable gall!
590 2018-02-19 19:26:48 Just like he was on bump stocks. How did that go?
591 2018-02-19 19:26:34 I wonder how many people on twitter named Brandon Combs would agree with the commenter Brandon Combs' position on Bump Stocks.
592 2018-02-19 19:26:24 Therefore, because we are not a homogenous society we must have AR-15s, armor piercing rounds, high capacity mags, silencers, bump stocks, and those determined mentally insane by a Court should be able to buy guns? What about the “well regulated” part of that clause?
593 2018-02-19 19:26:21 My laser focus and everyone else’s laser focus. Just read the news when you get a minute. People are tired of their children being murdered with automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc. When marshmallows become dangerous I’m sure we’ll do something about that.
594 2018-02-19 19:26:00 Okay! I'll return to the shop later to recheck the stocks. 
595 2018-02-19 19:25:56 ‘Hey dumb normal people - we bought stocks a long time ago which are now overpriced, and we’d appreciate it if you spent your money driving that price up higher before we sell them off and leave you holding the bag.’

598 2018-02-19 19:24:33 Before you get carried away about bump stocks, understand that you can create the very same effect with a simple belt taken off of your pants. Or you can easily create a similar contraption at home with little talent. Pure distraction.

600 2018-02-19 19:23:11 Unless it includes all the kids that have been owning Trump on tv for the last three days we'll know it's staged. He deserves to meet them when he can hand them his signed bill of new background checks, and banning AR15s and bump stocks.
601 2018-02-19 19:20:38 No one cares.. just buy stocks.. :P
602 2018-02-19 19:20:33 My laser focus and everyone else’s laser focus. Just read the news when you get a minute. People are tired of their children being murdered with automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc. When marshmallows become dangerous I’m sure we’ll do something about that. But until then...
603 2018-02-19 19:20:27 Sure... how bout them bump stocks?
604 2018-02-19 19:20:16 I just have 3 questions, and we can move on with our lives. Do you believe private gun sales over the internet should have background checks? Do you think bump stocks should be illegal? And do you think handgun age should be 21 while AR-15 is 18?
605 2018-02-19 19:19:11 How does it make you feel to know that somewhere out there, someone calls socks “stocks” because they think it’s supposed to be an abbreviation of “stockings”?
606 2018-02-19 19:19:06 @Stocks_68  he really is  what will I do In the summer months? @nowanorthener
607 2018-02-19 19:18:28 Me too!  I just want informed changes. Going after carrying capacities, bump stocks, coming up with an awesome universal background check, mandatory waiting periods...these are all good ideas. Making sure law enforcement acts on tips in regards to  unstable folks. All good things
608 2018-02-19 19:18:28 Sorry, but lots of these weapons were, in fact, legally obtained. Cruz certainly legally bought the AR-15 used at M.S.D.H.S. The Vegas shooter bought his weapons and bump stocks legally. That's part of the problem. Tactical weapons should not be legal for civilians.
609 2018-02-19 19:17:36 See, the difference is that many of us believe that if asking people to give up their AK-15s which NO ONE needs for self-defense or hunting, saves even ONE life, that would make it worth doing. Making bump stocks illegal... how many lives in Vegas would THAT have saved??
610 2018-02-19 19:17:30 “Responsible” gun ownership should be clean records, detailed background checks, elongated waiting periods, required gun safety and handling class, written exam, fees, regular renewals and status background checks over lifetime ownership. Banning of bump stocks & assault rifles.

616 2018-02-19 19:13:07 I consider myself well-read when it comes to the uranium market, but I need to start researching other materials as well. The more I see about stocks the more I think the bulk of money is to be made from large swings in the resource sector.
617 2018-02-19 19:12:37 Ban the assault rifles and bump stocks, put metal detectors and armed guards in schools. Put gun ownership at 21 years. Duh...
618 2018-02-19 19:12:33 I don't want all gun sales banned and round up every citizens weapons, I want bump stocks to be illegal. I want anyone who has had multiple people go to law enforcement warning about their mental instability to go through a tough screening process. This isn't zero sum.

623 2018-02-19 19:10:21 The Cornyn/Murphy proposed gun bill tht T appears 2 like does NOT address assault rifles/bump stocks & 2 narrow in scope! Just a wink &  nod
624 2018-02-19 19:10:09 A deficit can be caused by many things and is based on actuarial calculations, regulation (e.g. FRS17) life expectancy, inv markets, gilt yields etc. Well funded scheme could face a deficit if markets and circumstances change. Though, companies not paying enough doesn't help!
625 2018-02-19 19:10:01 But... but... how???
626 2018-02-19 19:10:01 I agree! I supported banning bump stocks after Vegas. My fear is gun control is a slippery slope, plus I strongly believe we have a societal issue that won’t be fixed by banning any kind of gun or modification device
627 2018-02-19 19:09:46 They're just rifles, like the ones with wood stocks that you see Elmer Fudd carrying. They're not "assault weapons" because their appearance looks scary to you.
Some people even hunt with them.

And any gun can kill people. So can your car. So can your mom's chef's knife.
628 2018-02-19 19:09:26 Laws? Nah, they’ll refer it to ATF like bump stocks and nothing will happen. Hope I’m wrong, but I have history on my side.
629 2018-02-19 19:09:10 Bump stocks. I thought you said you knew guns. How do you not know that?
630 2018-02-19 19:08:45 In The Market: IBD readers know we had a key Day 4 follow-through on #Valentines Day, signaling a new uptrend may emerge. That day, more #stocks hit new lows (65 on #Nasdaq, 42 on #NYSE) vs new highs (44, 36). However, the trend has reversed. On 2/15, 142 new highs v 61 new lows
631 2018-02-19 19:08:34 No one gives up their right to own a gun. Similar to not being able to drive an Indy Car on the highway and having speed limits, sensible gun laws would limit access to bump stocks/semi-automatic rifles and limit the number of rounds in a magazine. Common sense just like driving.

I believe in 2A but can’t imagine why we can’t enact common sense laws for better background checks, eliminating assault rifles and bump stocks.
634 2018-02-19 19:06:28 How about a NATIONWIDE online  database that records EVERY gun purchase and throws up designated red flags. Also a ban on bump stocks.
635 2018-02-19 19:06:03 Ethereum has almost 23k nodes.
636 2018-02-19 19:05:26 ..How does this shooting the NRA’s fault? The NRA is millions of Americans volunteering to pay to be a member. NRA teaches people how to be responsible gun owners. Did you know the NRA is for banning Bump Stocks? So tell me what is your solution? Take every Americans gun?
637 2018-02-19 19:05:13 As I said in another reply, with bump stocks these weapons will only function to massacre innocent civilians, as we've seen over & over. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. A little common sense in our gun laws and these massacres can be avoided.
638 2018-02-19 19:04:35 I get that.  There are millions of semi-automatic weapons in the hands of law abiding citizens that are used for hunting.  These guns are for the most part more powerful than an ARs.  Don't go after specific weapons. Go after magazine capacities and ad ons like bump stocks

661 2018-02-19 18:58:21 1) bump stocks don't convert guns to full auto. 
2)that won't stop kids using parents guns.
3)there is background checks on all sales (including gunshows) apart from some private sales.
4) that would limit guns such as those used in ww1 and 2. Plus they would be to easy to mod.
662 2018-02-19 18:58:00 The term "assault weapon" nowadays is referring to semiautomatic weapons, both rifles & guns. Considering bump stocks can convert them into automatics, capable to firing hundreds of rounds put these weapons into a category of their own, far above baseball bats or anything else.

712 2018-02-19 18:33:04 I'm a disabled SCPO, a gun owner, a gold star mother, and, apparently, a liberal piece of shit, because I think there is a place for regulations. Have I got that right, Dom? Universal background checks, no bump stocks, age 21 isn't horrible. Active duty should be different.
713 2018-02-19 18:32:41 Yes, we had a switch to select regular and full auto, the ones with the collapsible stock were AR15s and the ones with the full fixed stocks were M16s, I served in the Vietnam in 1968 & 1969, and served 9 years total in the Army. We used to call those rifles "Mattie Mattells"

716 2018-02-19 18:30:59 Zombies are created by too much studying for the Series 7. My brain is a stocks & bonds pinata. Soon it will explode...
717 2018-02-19 18:30:50 People with mental illnesses shouldn’t be allowed to purchase weapons. But what mental illnesses. Who decides that? Obama admin decided that was people who struggle to pay bills, so that’s not really gonna work. Bump stocks maybe.
718 2018-02-19 18:30:43 AR can be .22 or .223/5.56, but your point is still valid in a general sense.  Both the handgun and rifle are semi-automatic weapons.  Bump stocks and extended magazines could change the equation, of course.
719 2018-02-19 18:30:02 Happy POTUS day. Only legislation needs to be done on guns. Is two things. Rid of bump stocks. And allow schools to have the same standards as tsa. Metal detectors with armed concealed guards. No gun kills. Guns protect. Our nation has never been invaded?
720 2018-02-19 18:29:52 Hey Grainne We're not able to say as our stocks change all the time however it's  worth popping the item in your saved items so you can keep a closer eye on them. It's also worth checking our back in stock page & our new in page in case a similar item catches your eye.
721 2018-02-19 18:29:30 No one has suggested that, but we have to move beyond learned helplessness + enact laws to prohibit owning assault-type weapons, high-capacity clips, armor-piercing bullets, bump stocks, etc, end loopholes + require enhanced registration. Common sense stuff--

723 2018-02-19 18:28:46 Watch the video people... #stocks #video
724 2018-02-19 18:28:35 Stocks are like sushi, you want to make sure they still look good after sitting out at room temperature for a few hours
725 2018-02-19 18:28:32 Ban assault weapons and bump stocks. Assault weapons were banned before. It can be done again. There are many other varieties of guns that may be retained for the gun enthusiasts.
726 2018-02-19 18:28:10 How about this. No naming of shooters. No 24 -7 tv.
Automatic death penalty within 30 days.broader background checks.outlaw bump stocks. 10 yr. sentence for false threats.
727 2018-02-19 18:27:35 Saying "no need to research" is like saying "no need to eat or breath air". Are you aware of how traditional investments (stocks, futures, bonds, ect.) affect the crypto market? If not, you should be because they do. But stocks are irrelevant now right, @AntonKreil
728 2018-02-19 18:27:23 You do know he’s paid with stocks and very little salary which is a legal tax cheat in middle class America values
729 2018-02-19 18:27:19 #MSNBC The offer of expanded background checks is more of a red herring,than a solution.There’d still be 1000’s of AR-15’s  in our society,there’d still be bump stocks & access to unlimited ammo & large magazines, and there’d still be ZERO accountability for careless gun owners
730 2018-02-19 18:27:12 Also bump stocks.

737 2018-02-19 18:22:41 I agree that Bump stocks are illegal. But a gun that's semi auto includes a whole.lot of guns. 4'10s, 12 gauge, 306's, 22's. Hell all regular guns are semi auto. It takes killers to kill. Not a piece of steel. Killers use handguns 100 times more often than rifles. Guns protect

752 2018-02-19 18:21:17 Mass shooting deaths = NRA profits. The more people killed, the more profit for them. That's why they don't want AR-15's & bump stocks banned. That's why they gave millions to Trump so he'd make it easier for the mentally ill to buy guns.

756 2018-02-19 18:20:15 Ben your 1st Amendment rights are intact if bump stocks are banned and min age to buy AR-15's raised to 21.
757 2018-02-19 18:19:58 Limiting magazine capacity and bump stocks is a good thing. No shooter is taking a  hand gun to schools. I’d also add, closing loopholes to prevent the sale of guns w/o background checks,& not burying studies on gun violence. More communication between local & federal forces too
758 2018-02-19 18:19:49 I would support the banning of all bump stocks. And then maybe we could Prohibit hotel guests from keeping housekeeping out of the rooms for more than two days
759 2018-02-19 18:19:30 Churning out  every week  with the new updates of  new stocks in and old stocks outs
in a lightning speed  is ansurd and claims 1000% returns over 5 yrs is big fraud.  Such bogus sites sud be banned .  don't know hu many such exists in the net.
760 2018-02-19 18:18:26 You've been watching 2 many lies on @seanhannity @FoxNews @foxandfriends. Left doesn't want to disarm Americans. 

We think ppl should:
Be 21
Required classes/test on safety - like for driver's license
No assault weapons
Ban bump stocks as even NRA agreed w after Vegas
3 day wait
761 2018-02-19 18:17:25 Saw "Taga-hatid Pasko" Ad ng Coke. Naiyak aq  its all true, I remembered those times na 4am nsa store n ko para sa delivery ng Christmas stock. Then once na mag open yun store, non stop refill and withdraw from stocks. End ng duty 12mn, di mo n ramdam pasko tulad ng iba. 
762 2018-02-19 18:17:18 The short and distort type of short seller uses misinformation and a bear market to manipulate stocks. S&D is as illegal as the pump and dump, but is mainly used in a bull market. It is important for investors to be aware of the dangers and to know how to protect themselves.
763 2018-02-19 18:16:32 Like Snaf said chief, u don't kno any of us, but I can assure you it's not "our way" ! Also, u had lord @POTUS44 & he didn't do shit on guns, but make bump-stocks legal, but I have drilled down on Dear leader since he moved 2Chicago to work on weekly gun-deaths there...oh wait 
764 2018-02-19 18:15:48 Half the market heard that go go growth stocks are where it’s at ...the other half didn’t get the memo so sold random stuff in case the missed memo had bad things in it
765 2018-02-19 18:15:13 Correction seems like it might be over. Gains ahead! #stocks #gains
766 2018-02-19 18:15:07 This story never ends. Same lack of paper for title deeds in 2015/6. Probably because the Treasury has to sign off on all stationery purchase, and those ordering wait until their stocks are below EOQ. Then, it has to be a new tender with a different middleman.
767 2018-02-19 18:15:00 Cont..

5. Ban bump stocks and other mods that allow for full-auto

6. Include extensive wait times. 

7. Close gunshow loopholes. 

Simply banning rifles and handguns won’t happen in this country.
768 2018-02-19 18:14:12 i wna buy sendm*love's fan cus my fan has scratches n i love that fan alot lmao PLZ tell me ure coming n hv stocks (but that proves that ure a sasa*ng even more.......)
769 2018-02-19 18:14:09 Didn't they do a similar thing with bump stocks...
770 2018-02-19 18:13:52 Yeah, I never said only buy stocks when their price declines. But waiting until the stock price moves higher and loses it value in relation to its price is just as ill-advised. If you think a stock has value, buy it. Why wait until its value declines? Your advice is bad.
771 2018-02-19 18:13:03 Stocks, #ALDUBAngInspirasyon
772 2018-02-19 18:12:58 That's slightly misleading, not all shops stock a range of pot noodles for instance my local Aldi's only stocks two chicken and mushroom & original curry!!
773 2018-02-19 18:12:07 Oh damn... I was about to reduce some stocks I own, but I didn't remember that the US stock market is closed today since our local markets where open. 

Oh well, another good reason for crypto which is 24/7.

774 2018-02-19 18:11:38 I think he was essentially trying to say that buying higher usually is buying over resistance or new 52 week breakouts which tend to be better than buying the chop or downtrending stocks. He has a point but the market needs to show strength
775 2018-02-19 18:09:54 I'm old enough to remember Republicans saying they were "open" to banning bump stocks after the Vegas shooting.
776 2018-02-19 18:09:35 Thing is, all these people giving stock "tips" on TV or web sites are just trying to pump (or depress) the prices of specific stocks so they can do a flip and make some money for themselves, off their own audience's backs.

And this Randist idiot just totally gave away the game.

779 2018-02-19 18:07:57 That DOES NOT go far enough. There was a law in place. #Trump killed it... and with that, killed 17 innocent kids. He needs to ban assault weapons, bump stocks and arsenal-building. It's no longer for defense. It's now a sign of #smallpenissyndrome #GunLawsNOW
780 2018-02-19 18:07:54 Well...since obama didn’t do anything except legalize bump stocks and sell illegal guns to Mexico I guess it’s up to a real president now.

782 2018-02-19 18:06:44 Then nigga got stocks, such a good friend you are to teach me some of what you know!
783 2018-02-19 18:06:08 Bump stocks do not turn any weapon into assault weapons by the ATF's own definition. It still is a single pull of the trigger to cause the weapon to fire once just uses the recoil of the gun to bump it into your finger. Not a pull of the trigger and continuous fire like fullauto.
784 2018-02-19 18:05:50 I don't think anybody is suggesting that we take away ALL guns, just military type that can kill 17 students in 6 minutes or bump stocks that can kill 58 in 10 minutes.
Can that work for you?
785 2018-02-19 18:05:48 Then don't show a double barrelled shotgun even though technically a "Semi-Auto" weapon it's nothing compared to Bump Stocks and AR-15's!
786 2018-02-19 18:05:48 Get into the stocks for an hour and let anyone use you at leisure?
787 2018-02-19 18:04:07 Yep, they did. Ur media may not have told u that.  Forget party, this is abt banning assault weapons like under Bush, but it expired. Ban bump stocks. Most amer agree on reasonable controls, regardless of party. More than 90% want this.
788 2018-02-19 18:03:47 Okay my questions were not related or trying to squeeze info fr stocks those were just to get your views on current mess in PSU thanks fr all the help n knowledge sharing
789 2018-02-19 18:03:44 Bump stocks are already illegal.
790 2018-02-19 18:03:43 How are these “taking my guns away”? 

*Universal background checks
*Banning “bump stocks”
*Banning assault weapon sales
*Stop “Sportsmen’s Act”
*Stop “Share” Act
*Stop “Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act” 

Research people! #BanAssaultWeapons
791 2018-02-19 18:03:34 I live in wyoming and everyone has guns, most shouldn’t have them.  To be clear, I own guns and support the 2A but banning assault rifles and bump stocks, universal background checks, waiting periods and sensible gun control doesn’t infringe on my right to own any of my guns!
792 2018-02-19 18:03:32 To minimize risk one should diversify their portfolio, and by investing in negatively correlated stocks one can almost completely nullify any risk guaranteeing some return #ECO2307
793 2018-02-19 18:03:28 Actually bump stocks ARE illegal. Assault weapons of any type ARE illegal. A bump stock has the ability to create an assault weapon, therefore it is by definition illegal and enforceable by ATF and any law enforcement agency. No additional specific legislation is necessary.
794 2018-02-19 18:03:28 Ban bump stocks. Require licensing and testing to own a firearm. And jail penalties if you are not properly securing your weapons. Why is it we don’t see these atrocities in Canada? Why is the US murder rate higher than any developed nation?
795 2018-02-19 18:02:39 Wait. I seem to remember a previous dialogue:Oh yeah, like this?
"President Trump and the National Rifle Association got behind the push for outlawing “bump stocks” Thursday, giving rare momentum to gun control legislation in response to the Las Vegas massacre"
- zip
796 2018-02-19 18:02:15 Unrelated stocks in a portfolio that are negatively correlated remove the risk of investment.

797 2018-02-19 18:02:12 I certainly support your proposal Brian, especially moving the age limit up on ARs & banning bump stocks. Science has now demonstrated that the human brain is not fully developed until age 25. Ideally, I  would like 25 to be the minimum age at which any weapons purchase is legal.
798 2018-02-19 18:01:55 5/ morphed to mean the look. There is a industry that sells different looks like stocks and all visible parts where a person can buy and replace the plain ones with the AR-15 style and have a custom rifle. Each of the replaced part is usually attached via a couple of screws or
799 2018-02-19 18:01:34 A wealth fund is a state-owned investment fund that invests in real and financial assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate, precious metals, or in alternative investments such as private equity fund or hedge funds. Wealth funds invest globally.
800 2018-02-19 18:01:23 Well there’s your standard! Anyone with 10 guns or more is potentially dangerous and mentally insane. Go get em! If I thought anyone would read this tweet I’d be buying gun stocks.
801 2018-02-19 18:00:44 I think that utility tokens that are basically pre-paid sales that increases in value if the sale go well will take a lot of market share from both stocks and customer reward programs, as they are something in between. And these pseudo-stocks are traded  24/7 internationally.
802 2018-02-19 18:00:23 Removing an immediate risk of financial collapse was pretty much the intention. That would be expected to end the panic leading to stocks gaining value as they were substantially more secure.
803 2018-02-19 18:00:16 Could you imagine if the right came to the table offering restrictions on large-capacity magazines, bump stocks, background checks Etc and the left offered restrictions on late-term abortion procedures?
804 2018-02-19 17:59:09 Bonaz Capital is a stock advisory company in Indore. Their employees Miss Keshu & Singhania really mislead. They promised teaching Technical Analysis n give Calls on Stocks,, Took the Money. And never delivered on either
805 2018-02-19 17:59:00 Are bump stocks still badly regulated?
806 2018-02-19 17:58:15 @MomsDemand Trump is "thinking" about re-vamping security checks? This is NOT enough, he can't even keep his own house in order ie:clearances! Guns of war must be banned and that includes bump stocks. I feel good about these students! They are speaking for the 17 who can't speak!
807 2018-02-19 17:57:56 I completely disagree. Would you agree to ban bump stocks? Ban anyone on no fly list from purchasing any guns? Ban anyone receiving benefits for mental disability, close background check loopholes at gunshows.?
808 2018-02-19 17:56:56 1/ Or it’s like the @GOP “support” to ban bump stocks and will end in no legislation again.
809 2018-02-19 17:56:49 His hair cut will give him away !! And they should bring back the stocks in the Center of town & name & shame them for aweek it would be worse than prison & shame him & his entire family into disgrace

 Keynes observation that Stock Market is what ordinary people think what ordinary people think about stocks
811 2018-02-19 17:55:39 Also, republicans control the house, the senate, and the executive branch right now. How about putting some protections in for Americans? How about banning the sale of assault rifles and bump stocks? How about not taking away services for people with mental illness?
812 2018-02-19 17:54:20 …the bump stocks would be useless if we ban assault weapons again.

916 2018-02-19 17:52:19 Anyway we both agree that bump stocks are bad and should be banned, but I also think that rifles that can be easily fitted with bump stocks (detachable stocks and grips) should be regulated.
917 2018-02-19 17:52:19 THESE ARE W/M/Ds. Anyone who buys, sells, or possess one of these, or bump-stocks should be classified as a potential DOMESTIC TERRORIST. 
RT if you agree.
918 2018-02-19 17:52:15 Reason: UK only stocks those big physical games (Mario/Zelda/etc) soooooo yea
919 2018-02-19 17:52:09 So Seth..
Or should that be zippy
It's apparent you dont understand how threads work...  drew brought bump stocks to the thread... before you got here

Go on "smart boy"
920 2018-02-19 17:52:00 In Las Vegas, 58 people died and over *500* were injured and they STILL HAVEN'T OUTLAWED BUMP STOCKS
921 2018-02-19 17:51:31 Yes good value in the stocks. They’re the only game in town so it should be a safe investment
922 2018-02-19 17:50:38 I seem to remember this:
"President Trump and the National Rifle Association got behind the push for outlawing “bump stocks” Thursday, giving rare momentum to gun control legislation in response to the Las Vegas massacre"
Then, nada.
Funny thing, the Internet never forgets.
923 2018-02-19 17:50:07 Additionally they should ban any gun that could be rigged to behave like an AR. And bump stocks.
924 2018-02-19 17:48:19 2nd Amendment was written LONG ago. Weapons of war, assault rifles automatic rifles, bump stocks, these things should be carefully controlled as the use of these have so far resulted in mass killings/carnage, Innocents, especially children become targeted victims
925 2018-02-19 17:47:03 I have an idea @cnn. Instead of copying WH announcements printed up as news, why don't you follow up on the last WH gun promise about bump stocks? Then you can REPORT that Trump didn't do anything about that either.
926 2018-02-19 17:46:16 According to State Senator Galvano, the Florida Senate will try to implement new legislation that restricts ages for gun purchases, put a ban on bump stocks, and have gun violence restraining orders. @kammerichmJ2150 #J2150CB
927 2018-02-19 17:46:01 Yes familiar with the memo that came out last week and the discussion of the $100 million. What's new is that the Senate is now discussing age restrictions, a ban on bump stocks, a waiting period for rifle purchases, Baker Act changes
928 2018-02-19 17:44:33 Je ne pense pas en refaire avant cet été non. Donc tout dépendra de mes stocks lorsque tu passeras commande ^^'
929 2018-02-19 17:44:22 Plz let me know
930 2018-02-19 17:44:15 I had invested had earned money from Manufacturing into stocks solely for long term due to nil LTCG. Now I am rethinking of diversifying into Long term tax efficient investing.
931 2018-02-19 17:43:10 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to cure your ADHD
932 2018-02-19 17:42:58 I can agree with all of that. But we need to implement psychological tests and ban assault rifles and bump stocks. No handgun/rifle should be able to fire more than 10 rounds w/o needing to be reloaded. It would minimize the body count.
933 2018-02-19 17:42:20 Ima Put The Trap Money Into Stocks 
934 2018-02-19 17:42:08 Hi ....What about tmrw tata steel stocks up or down
935 2018-02-19 17:40:27 Nice tap dance Marco!

But it is still too little too late. 
Hell you #GOP Clowns couldn't even BAN BUMP STOCKS! WTF?
936 2018-02-19 17:40:15 I love a nigga that can really teach me something. Now somebody teach me about stocks & bonds

939 2018-02-19 17:39:37 one of my old professors always stocks her candy bowl with stuff i like.. i went in to her office this morning and her son goes “oh ya this weekend mom made a trip to the store just to be sure we had candy for you” #thankful
940 2018-02-19 17:39:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
941 2018-02-19 17:39:30 The FCF was 4% or so last year when the 5-year was <2%s. Now we've rallied in stocks a lot since mid-2017 and unless you believe in sustained high EPS growth over the next few yrs, a 4% FCF is a lot less attractive vs. 2.6% 5-year UST
942 2018-02-19 17:38:47 As someone that does both...yes. Cryptos > currencies/commodities >>>>>>>>> stocks/bonds for TA.  One day cryptos won’t be that way, but that’s not due to earnings but rather market inefficiencies (or emotions). Also TA here is somewhat self fulfilling
943 2018-02-19 17:38:27 Keeping my eye on the following throughout the week. $AVGR $BBOX $AQMS $CATB $HTBX $NGTF $ONTX $DCAR $MOSY $MBRX Do your own DD & go with what’s right for you. #girlswhotrade #stocks
944 2018-02-19 17:37:41 I'll make no bones about questioning the need for such rifles in the hands of civilians. When I see hunting rifles being used in these mass shootings then I might think differently. NO rifle should be made to be modified to accept high capacity mags or bump stocks, agree?
945 2018-02-19 17:36:24 this is true i have a lot of stocks
946 2018-02-19 17:35:35 Sir it happens every now and then in #karachi Jub tak ala hukaam kay stocks dry honay ka az khud notice naheen laytay kuch naheen hota
947 2018-02-19 17:35:26 I do believe there should be full background checks, gun licenses, more gun safety training, mandatory reporting for lost/stolen guns, 21 age limit, banned bump stocks, & banned weapons for citizens that are made/designed for mass killing. 
#GunReform
948 2018-02-19 17:34:56 He only hires the finest( creeps)!
949 2018-02-19 17:34:18 A clear majority support banning bump stocks and assault weapons. I'm a rural dem and a gun owner (moved to Madison WI from up North) and I support those measures.
950 2018-02-19 17:34:15 To start, universal background checks, assault weapons ban, high capacity magazine, bump stocks, and other weaponry ban, registry of current ownership and purchases, better mental health care (and health care), education reform and improvements....
951 2018-02-19 17:34:15 And you sir have defeated us all by making America first among laughing stocks of the world
952 2018-02-19 17:34:15 “Grouse moor estates take advantage of the few species which can tolerate their barren heather habitat without compromising grouse stocks and laud them as conservation achievements. This is a cynical distraction from reality and the public should not be fooled.” @FoxHITeam
953 2018-02-19 17:33:38 Not quite. Technical experts determined that certain bump stocks weren't covered by the Gun Control/Fire Arm Act so there was a loophole. You're implying the previous president chose to legalise bumpstocks - that's false. Regardless if all can agree to close loophole now great.
954 2018-02-19 17:33:28 Big Bad Wolf book fair in a while! Pleasssssse have some stocks of the books I need to buy  #BigBadWolf #BigBadWolfPH
955 2018-02-19 17:33:03 Things are really getting fixed?
Have you read the news lately?
Enjoy the next 3 years.the middle class will be broke,the proposed gas tax will negate any benefits from tax reform,gun reform?
school shootings? corporations buying back stocks with the cash savings,possibly a war.
956 2018-02-19 17:32:40 Bout to look into buying some stocks
957 2018-02-19 17:32:22 Make Stocks Trade Again
958 2018-02-19 17:32:14 J'aimerais bien en profiter mais rupture partout...
Généralement 2 semaines avant tu trouvais quand même des stocks...
A croire que le mot est passé cette fois-ci !

Bon je vais de ce pas réserver Strange Journey Redux si y a encore des stocks.
959 2018-02-19 17:31:43 Any of you guys or gals have any recommendations for some stocks that you have had good luck with? I am certainly a beginner.
960 2018-02-19 17:31:08 Global stocks break recovery streak with U.S. and China closed: LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks were set to post their first loss in five days on Monday, breaking a winning streak that saw them recover almost half their losses from a violent sell-off two weeks ago.
961 2018-02-19 17:30:54 Well Obama on two occasions approved the sale of bump stocks.  So what he do to help the people in Las Vegas?  And it's not like they had two yrs of super majority to do something.
962 2018-02-19 17:30:34 First off, you put down NRA supporters...YET the NRA supports tighter restrictions on bump stocks . Secondly, the “AR” stands for Armalite rifle, not assault rifle. Most guns used in shootings are NOT assault weapons. They are semi automatic, and illegally obtained, you uneduca
963 2018-02-19 17:30:25 What I just shared with you is not FUD... 100s of people got ripped off on a couple master node coins from price manipulation by stocks exchange
964 2018-02-19 17:30:18 Ooo, tough guy! Do YOU feel any guilt, Marco?
965 2018-02-19 17:29:50 A perfect example of why public stocks should be brought back in.
966 2018-02-19 17:29:24 I agree about 2FA but stocks exchange is a known scam. So really let the fud drive it into the ground.

"Stock exchange is scam beware ,dont use Stock Exchange, when we deposit they transfer to self MN wallet after 24 hour, pay to your wallet, this is SCAMMER SUCK EXCHANGE."
967 2018-02-19 17:29:07 You have not even taken steps to ban bump stocks since Vegas @POTUS @RepMoBrooks @DougJones @SenShelby @SpeakerRyan .  Shame.
968 2018-02-19 17:28:46 We were better off before assault weapons and bump fire stocks were profiting gun manufacturers and the NRA. Good time to say #GunControlNow Emphatically!
969 2018-02-19 17:28:40 What about bump stocks, assault rifles, high capacity mag, and people on no-fly list? Ban.
970 2018-02-19 17:28:26 Needs to do more.... he slipped back into the same rhetoric from Republicans. This is not hard...., ban assult rifles, very strong background checks, mandatory training with psyc evaluation , stop inregistered gun show sales, bump stocks ....
971 2018-02-19 17:27:40 Dropped $250 on some stocks and made $12, idk how y'all do that 9-5 shit 

*tweets this from my 9-5 that lets me afford stocks*
972 2018-02-19 17:27:15 @timothysykes your program blows and so do your alerts of already spiked stocks totally useless. Your just a show off
973 2018-02-19 17:27:05 @JohnCornyn Ideas re: gun violence: Improve K-12 school security. Educate teachers, parents, MD's. Improve mental health services. Ban sale of guns/rifles to anyone <21. Ban unlicensed gun dealers. Have a 2-day minimum waiting period. Improve background checks. Ban bump stocks.
974 2018-02-19 17:26:12 I don't want to be armed. I am a teacher. Better to bad assault rifles and bump stocks period!
975 2018-02-19 17:25:46 Tokens specifically are going to drive significant change and most people are stuck watching the price of these “penny stocks”
976 2018-02-19 17:25:19 I am not a leftist and a gun owner. No one needs AR15/AK 47s, or bump stocks, or lg capacity magazines. Open carry of long guns is stupid and should be permitted if you want to do that. Better ways to ck mental health of gun purchasers. See not everyone is a "leftist".
977 2018-02-19 17:24:57 Sick & tired of @NRA
that we want to "take" your guns. U know thats impossible! There are enough guns in the US 4 every man woman child 2 have 3. Regulate automatics, bump stocks, large mags!!! U don't need those to protect property or life unless Ur a poor shot. #GunReformNow
978 2018-02-19 17:24:21 Yup. Effective gun control. @RedTRaccoon has a good start list: 
21 yr old. 
Registration. 
No gun show sales - they don't have 3 day wait & checks. 
No assault weapons. (GOP let that expire.) 
Bump stocks banned. 
Required gun training. Like drivers classes b4 get car license.
979 2018-02-19 17:23:45 Hyrule Castle, 3 stocks, high damage, and a Luigi main! Let's SMASH!!!!!
980 2018-02-19 17:23:43 So bump-stocks are illegal now?
981 2018-02-19 17:23:26 Automatic guns are already illegal in most states and very difficult to obtain legally in the few states they're permitted in at all. I agree that bump stocks should be banned.
982 2018-02-19 17:23:25 .... but again, there no reason for us to sell world indices, dips are just another oppertunity to get long! #elliottwave #stocks $SPX $DJIA
983 2018-02-19 17:21:51 I’ve been wanting to invest in stocks forever but I just keep hesitating....
984 2018-02-19 17:20:59 @VASenate@@VaHouse No more excuses.  It is past time for a stand-alone bill addressing assault rifles and bump stocks.  We will no longer stand by while you refuse to do the minimum of your job obligations.
985 2018-02-19 17:20:34 Need to check my stocks soon.... And see what I have
986 2018-02-19 17:20:27 I want an all black benz without no tints, so you can see the gold glow when the sun shine in
put pirellis on stocks, I don’t want no rims
987 2018-02-19 17:20:11 One of the stocks which whenever one has entered will have to sell lower only...buy low, sell lower types :)
988 2018-02-19 17:19:40 World stocks break recovery streak with U.S. and Paul Ferris closed
989 2018-02-19 17:19:37 Not just certain guns assault rifles and bump stocks. We need to do more.
990 2018-02-19 17:19:33 Could one argue that TA is MORE relevant to crypto than stocks because crypto is more dependent on emotion rather than, you know, earnings and stuff?
991 2018-02-19 17:18:49 I suggest you read the 2nd amendment.  It doesn't mention AR 15s.  Or bump stocks.  That amendment is only talking about the guns and ammunition at that time.  
992 2018-02-19 17:17:32 @danspena hey dan do You trade stocks? What are you investing in anything Else but businesses and real estate?
993 2018-02-19 17:17:21 Okay, well a crazy guy with a knife can’t kill 50 people like someone with an AR-15 and bump stocks. It’s not because it’s not reported, it’s because it’s not easy to do in other places. And how often do those major knife stabbings happen?
994 2018-02-19 17:17:10 @realDonaldTrump 4. No automatic weapons, bump stocks, etc, 5. Mandatory report to FBI for any buyer seeking more than 1 gun in a 6 month period, 6. Open and concealed carry for law enforcement only, 7. Gun owner responsibility for any crime committed with his/her gun.  (2/2)
995 2018-02-19 17:15:51 Her family probably owns stocks in arms companies and ammunition suppliers.  Go dig something up, Ed.

998 2018-02-19 17:15:09 Joy,. When the economy dumps everybody will have to do a "Weekend" in a private prison. Just to get stocks up for the nation. Instead of Military draft it'll be "Prison draft" we educate when you're done.
999 2018-02-19 17:14:38 His Mar-a-Lago members are thrilled. They’ll buy stock in every gun company and dance when shootings happen. Because their stocks go up.
1000 2018-02-19 17:14:16 Agree, very true.   Yet wen it was one sided consensus that stocks would go up, they did, for a long damn time
1001 2018-02-19 17:14:08 That’s a great news. Is it almost confirmed? There are so many stocks on my radar now for Tuesday.

1010 2018-02-19 17:09:20 Gary... Please consider semi-auto AR15 type weapon ban, strengthen background checks, ban bump-stocks, eliminate gun-show exceptions, and more severe penalties (a felony) for straw buyers. I don't care how many weapons you want to have.

1013 2018-02-19 17:07:24 Hence, midcap stocks tend to do better than large cap stocks in bull markets. On the other hand, these stocks are also the hardest hit in deep corrections. Let us take an example of Midcap 100 Index VS Nifty 50 and how they have performed.

1015 2018-02-19 17:06:26 @SpeakerRyan @RepDaveBrat We demand you bring to an immediate vote a bill for control of assault rifles and bump stocks.  We will not accept any further delay like you have been using in the past.  Wake up - we are fed up.
1016 2018-02-19 17:06:15 What if the "long bull run" was not actually supported by strong earnings, and instead something unrelated caused it?  Fed. Reserve admits massive buyer of US Stocks.  Volatility could have been caused by their liquidation of holdings.

1018 2018-02-19 17:03:41 I'm old enough to remember when Republicans "signaled a willingness" to ban bump stocks after 500+ people were shot at a concert.
1019 2018-02-19 17:03:16 Socks and stocks szn coming soon
1020 2018-02-19 17:02:12 I guess it depends on ones perspective, after all I got the judge,tax reform,pipeline,out of Paris Accords,oil drilling in Alaska,repeal of obamacare mandate,EPA neutered,end of the Clintons,soaring stocks,record unemployment,highest tax revenue ever collected. not to shabby.
1021 2018-02-19 17:02:04 I was wondering why stocks were updating today and then I realized it’s fucking Presidents’ Day!!
1022 2018-02-19 17:01:18 Thanks. If stocks were not loaded at Reading then the next opportunity for replenishment is at Birmingham New Street. Again, apologies for the inconvenience caused. ^DA

1026 2018-02-19 17:00:27 Shelly Moore Capito on @HoppyKercheval's not advocating for gun control, but says rather "we need to have a conversation about everything, just like we did with bump stocks and Las Vegas."

To which Hoppy responds "Yeah we already had that conversation and nothing came of it."
1027 2018-02-19 17:00:24 If bump stocks are a "novelty item" then banning them shouldn't be a big deal.
1028 2018-02-19 17:00:05 So tired of this argument, Charlie. 2A enthusiasts will probably be fine without assault weapons. They’ll definitely be fine without bump stocks.
1029 2018-02-19 16:59:57 No one ever suported Mr Adhia when he was giving a hint tht investing in stocks requires no efforts.  He meant to say tht siphoning investors money requires no efforts

1031 2018-02-19 16:59:16 After more research wonder if I should try at the penny stocks, or attempt at being a 4-5year investor
1032 2018-02-19 16:57:53 Yep, anecdotes exist - the vast majority of shootings haven't included bump stocks (I honestly can't remember another). But go ahead and ban them.

The Vegas killer murdered 58 ppl and injured 800 in 20 minutes. The Nice France truck killer murdered 86 & injured 434 in 90 seconds
1033 2018-02-19 16:57:45 We are talking about inflated valuation of stocks of #ChoksiScam #NiravModiLoot someone should also check  inventory stocks & debtors being ‘good’ of thousands of companies reporting profits as they continue to borrow on fictitious assets. Financial innovation 101.
1034 2018-02-19 16:57:12 Why not hire those veterans to stand at gun shops and shows to do background checks! Or hire them to destroy all the bump stocks? Real...honest...work.

1037 2018-02-19 16:55:44 Scott has defied Trump's base like on bump stocks etc. I've always thought with Scott it was his ego-he made a proclamation that Trump is a genius and he'll try to feed that delusion no matter what-But he is now like he has Russian backing ticking off serious guys who do not play
1038 2018-02-19 16:55:05 Paid for by a 2000% tax on ammunition?
That might at least put bump stocks out of most peoples' reach?

1040 2018-02-19 16:54:18 Dixon says time for asking is over, it’s time to demand, also ban sale of bump stocks, that were used in the Las Vegas shooting. #chsnews
1041 2018-02-19 16:53:55 That's smart. While I was doing pretty well with stocks, I still wanted to expand my horizons and jump outside of my comfort zone. Safe to say it worked out for me! If you're interested in learning forex please feel free to reach out
1042 2018-02-19 16:53:15 Very SAD! that you missed the signals: assault weapons and bump stocks have NO place in civil society. Very SAD! you revoked Obama-era regulation requiring the SSA to send records of severe mental  disabilities to the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check  System.
1043 2018-02-19 16:52:37 Sir which stocks can I invest in this downtrend market which can give good yeld in 2-3months?
1044 2018-02-19 16:51:09 You can buy anything in the store. Stocks on on cleaning mf supplies bc dats what isle im in.
1045 2018-02-19 16:50:44 Sorry that should have been Andi and Fusz, both excellent stocks. I also own ifxy but not as confident on it as Andi and Fusz, no worries with them.
1046 2018-02-19 16:49:53 Oh yeah, like this?
"President Trump and the National Rifle Association got behind the push for outlawing “bump stocks” Thursday, giving rare momentum to gun control legislation in response to the Las Vegas massacre"
Funny thing, the Internet never forgets.
1047 2018-02-19 16:49:26 In my opinion guns should be treated like cars. There should be a national database where all gun owners, background checks, ammunition purchases & gun accessories like bump stocks are listed. This database should also close all loopholes & private sales... No guns confiscated.
1048 2018-02-19 16:48:52 @NRA I am a life member and an active voter. You R supposed 2 represent our gun rights, but lately you have been ignoring membership. STOP IT! Bump stocks and clips/magazines with capacities over 10 should be outlawed. We need better restrictions on ppl with mental illness. #NRA
1049 2018-02-19 16:48:29 He says a lot of lies. Did you forget this one?

1052 2018-02-19 16:47:08 So you're saying a plotting, premeditated murderer won't bother modifying a stock? (it's not that hard) I disagree, but given bump stocks are mostly a silly novelty item no one uses for anything serious (including these murderers), you can ban them, but it won't change anything.
1053 2018-02-19 16:46:53 Gotta keep an Eye on my stocks now
1054 2018-02-19 16:46:52 And AR-15s, extended clips, bump stocks, etc--should all be collector's items. The price of obtaining a collector's license or obtaining a collector's item, should be outrageously expensive. I think this would help with current mass access as well as keeping revenue for sellers
1055 2018-02-19 16:46:08 Public votes are there. It's up to legislators to write laws. The article says they know how to regulate public spaces but not 1200 round twin drum mags with bump stocks.
1056 2018-02-19 16:45:56 Thickos supporting most hard-right Cons (inc kipper hoey, NOT a labour friend) screw the nation. You're a tiny part of the UK economy, not worth screwing REAL jobs (or UK waters fish stocks like you did before). Transition is nescessary to save jobs jeopardised by COns early A50
1057 2018-02-19 16:45:02 @Team_Vitality quand est-ce ce que les maillots taille adulte seront de nouveaux en stocks svp ?
1058 2018-02-19 16:44:33 @Varneyco Not sure the AR-15 is "America's rifle," used for hunting? Sure, hunting if you want to explode a moose. And legal bump stocks can turn them into automatic assault weapons. Sure, they're everywhere, but should they still be legal to buy? Seems logical to discuss.
1059 2018-02-19 16:44:28 interesting why services stocks like   HAL  and HCLP trading with such pessimistic sentiment
1060 2018-02-19 16:44:17 @JulianEpstein the NRA supports and promotes gun safety, background checks, elimination of bump stocks, etc. Do the research you moron.
1061 2018-02-19 16:43:16 How to cut US deficit ? US gov or US Fed should buy US stocks! Why not ?!
1062 2018-02-19 16:43:05 President Cheeseburger please spend you time enacting common sense gun laws like no bump stocks, high capacity magazines, 21 years and up for a gun purchase, better mental heath screening. Make Our Children Safe.
1063 2018-02-19 16:41:49 7 million dollars in your war chest is more important than children's lives.  You support bump stocks and AK-47's.  Don't have your wife speak to goodness & decency.  There's nothing decent about your support of the NRA.
1064 2018-02-19 16:40:19 Idk what everyone else is saying. What I'M  saying is that we need gun control now. Constitution was written when there weren't semi auto rifles and bump stocks - just small arms. 2A didnt account for civilians owning weapons of war when our founders wrote it. #GunControlNow
1065 2018-02-19 16:39:35 Today most of the stocks have opened at a sizable gap low n stayed till the end and could be the same case tomorrow too. How do we deal with such stocks.
1066 2018-02-19 16:39:27 "Lower low" to 2400s for me. All dependent on the $, stronger $, weaker stocks has been the theme recently. TBD.
1067 2018-02-19 16:39:14 I sometimes forget I own stocks not bonds where I have to keep a look out of the stock market then when I was gonna, realized its a Holiday back home. Nice yan, Lyra
1068 2018-02-19 16:39:10 He banned muzzle breaks, pistol grips, adjustable stocks and get this bayonet lugs!!! Yea those kill a lot of people. He was trying to circumvent banning a specific gun because he knows that would get shot down too. It’s already been circumvented by manufacturers.
1069 2018-02-19 16:38:28 Bump stocks only work on rifles with a pistol grip and detachable stock.
1070 2018-02-19 16:38:16 @parkrun Will there be new stocks of the apricot tops being ordered. I have been waiting for months for new sizes.
1071 2018-02-19 16:37:59 Yes...great thanks to u...even i sold my stocks...and now will buy at lower level
1072 2018-02-19 16:37:22 @The_Shadow go bck to stocks 
1073 2018-02-19 16:37:11 Also note: bump stocks are not used by these killers (maybe there's an anecdote, but it has not been the case), and that's probably because they make it firing a gun wildly inaccurate, and you can't do it unless you are in a relatively stationary position.
1074 2018-02-19 16:37:02 My tech stocks has been flat all day. Guess Vol has calmed down quite a bit. $aapl, $tsla, $fb, $amzn, $goog, $nvda, $vmw
1075 2018-02-19 16:36:10 Do you already have new stocks particularly 1998 design and Folded and Hung black (L-XL)? We've been to 4 outlets already but still no luck
1076 2018-02-19 16:35:54 The organized stupidity directed at long guns without walnut stocks but with improved ergonomics makes me curious to try one.  Thought the origin of the AR series was as a survival tool.
1077 2018-02-19 16:34:38 @NRA Defend yourself. Tell the people advocate gun safety, background checks, against  bump stocks, etc.  You are getting blamed for gun violence when you are against it and not responsible for any of it. Educate the idiots and news media, same thing, idiots.
1078 2018-02-19 16:34:29 This has to be the most ridiculous thing on twitter right now world wide. Both stocks will do great, just leave it alone.

Did not auditors of foreign branches get confirmation from Indian Branches?
1081 2018-02-19 16:33:19 He must have sold his stocks already. ...
1082 2018-02-19 16:32:46 Electronic currency; its all a waste of time.  Finance business trades buying selling business stocks investments all a waste of space, financial centers are a massive waste of space energy effort and profits are empty and unsatisfactory to a humans whom already feels nothing.
1083 2018-02-19 16:31:27 Agreed..Bump stocks and such should be illegal. The only mass shooting that I am aware of that utilized a bump stock was Las Vegas, but they should still be illegal.
1084 2018-02-19 16:30:48 Please show me where I stated that bump stocks are only made for one type of gun.
1085 2018-02-19 16:30:00 Is it my turn?

1087 2018-02-19 16:27:59 How about banning bump stocks, 80% lower receivers, and loophole “firearms” like the Franklin Reformation and Mossberg Shockwave?
1088 2018-02-19 16:27:58 And, the NRA has agreed with you on bump stocks. So, there can be common ground in the debate - IF people are willing to listen as well as preach.
1089 2018-02-19 16:27:49 And I don't want YOUR gun -- what I want STRICT background checks. I want bump stocks and 100-round magazines BANNED. I want to know why I CAN'T buy 10 boxes of Sudafed at Target today but I CAN buy 2000 bullets at the gun shop. #GunReformNow
1090 2018-02-19 16:26:54 Your claim was that bump stocks *are only made for one type of gun*, and I'm asking you to substantiate that claim, not show me an anecdote and restate the claim without proof.
1091 2018-02-19 16:26:39 Nor is AR15, bump stocks, magazines, cyanide laced bullets, bullet proof vests, protected either. The 2nd amendment was written to protect citizens against tyranny of the government against its people. So this whole “chip away at my constitutional rights” is a living lie.
1092 2018-02-19 16:26:34 Well ar-15’s are actually a popular choice for hunting and there are other hunting rifles that don’t look as scary (due to wooden stocks i think) that would be more effective than ar-15’s for massacres. Not that im trying to give anyone ideas here. But in any case the gun isnt
1093 2018-02-19 16:26:15 When did I say anything about banning firearms? I’m more concerned with closing loopholes, creating waiting periods, expanded background checks, stronger enforcement of existing laws,  stopping unregulated gun sales, stopping burying gun violence research, bump stocks
1094 2018-02-19 16:26:14 It is multivariate and there are interaction effects among the variables. But, we can still act on single variables, like bump stocks.
1095 2018-02-19 16:25:57 Bump stocks banned. Stricter background checks. Age limits to purchase guns higher. Gun show loopholes closed.
1096 2018-02-19 16:24:34 What if your vote was worth more if you owned a house? What if how many stocks you owned dictated how long you could speak to your representative? What if your material wealth dictated your worth inside a supposed democracy?

It does. It isn't democratic. #TrySocialism
1097 2018-02-19 16:24:00 Banning bump stocks is like banning belt loops on jeans because a gun can be bump fired using belt loops.
1098 2018-02-19 16:23:00 Nope Obama was the worst and will remain their for decades if not forever.
 So tell us what makes him the worst.. is it the jobs Trump has brought to the US or the record breaking stocks, stopping the flow of illegals or maybe tax reform? Which one makes hm awful?

1102 2018-02-19 16:22:31 Agree. I’m in favor of giving all gun rights advocates as many flintlocks as they want. And if they don’t like their precious assault weapons, bump stocks & lg ammo clips being taken away...let’s all give them our lthoughts & prayers”. They seem to think that fixes everything.
1103 2018-02-19 16:22:23 Lets hope that will include closing the gun show and yard sale loopholes.

But nothing about bump stocks, large capacity magazines and assault weapon...
1104 2018-02-19 16:22:00 I think railing on corporate tax cuts is a losing position for Denocrats. For a majority of Americans most of their wealth either is or will be tied to corporations via stocks. And that money is taxed twice (when it's earned and when it's distributed).

1106 2018-02-19 16:20:15 Give it a quarter. If Scotia Bank ran a $4 Bilion annual deficit and forecasted a surplus, like your Province, shareholders would dump their stocks. Ont. Taxpayers have one option coming on June 7, for any hope on economic recovery.
1107 2018-02-19 16:20:11 And it’s no coincidence that the stocks shares and bonds grew by around 20% have a guess who benefited from this ?
1108 2018-02-19 16:20:01 As long as GOP control congress there will be no change, Talk of banning bump stocks ended after a week or two. The GOP is under the control of the NRA, America is being held hostage!!
1109 2018-02-19 16:19:45 Actually, to 'prevent' such, not 'want' such, per the 2nd Amendment. But I do support eliminating assault rifles and large magazines, bump stocks and such.
1110 2018-02-19 16:18:40 @dwyerstrategy After the move to the lows, the TV traders were fearful to recommend stocks until literally last week at $SPX 2750 when they all, in unison, recommended buying stocks again....comical
1111 2018-02-19 16:18:09 Yes!  How has life improved since they were made legal?  Bump stocks, silencers, background checks, raising age of access.  No slippery laws in the middle of the night.  Beware, that’s how WI republicans roll.
1112 2018-02-19 16:17:38 The only prophet who didn’t need forgiveness to be a  prophet the other 11 did. Why because Christ is the son of God.  Pretty simple to see whom to follow
1113 2018-02-19 16:17:01 Gee Jeff. Butt stocks needed? Assault rifles needed? Selling to mentally ill and people on terrorist watch list needed? Gop and nra are child killers just as guilty as the trigger men

1120 2018-02-19 16:16:12 This lesson will never be learned by 80% of investor !  80 % leave Stocks Mrkt when it’s  down but 20% learn/wait & benefit  ! Fresh & new 100 % gang arrive & then the cycle repeats itself !
1121 2018-02-19 16:15:55 The recent #MYN history since last September has actually been very good. @TexasEddieG inherited a car crash, strong management and vision is creating one of the most unlikely turnarounds you will see on the LSE. Take it out of your ‘punt’ stocks list it’s a conviction buy.
1122 2018-02-19 16:15:39 @SenPatRoberts @JerryMoran @RepKevinYoder Even tho today is a govt holiday, please keep working with your fellow Congresspeople to enact stricter gun control laws. Eliminate civilian access to assault rifles & bump stocks, & reinstate mental health checks.
1123 2018-02-19 16:15:39 I always revert to my old street stocks days at Wall Stadium. The saying was.. These guys will run over their own grandmothers to win.  So we all experienced being the grandmother. We all remember who ran us over. #NeverForget
1124 2018-02-19 16:15:29 How many 15 years old know how to read stocks, balance a check book and more importantly know a car is not a investment it depreciates as soon as you drive away from dealer.  Parents please teach!!! Be insightful! We want your guidance.
1125 2018-02-19 16:15:17 Obama legalised bump stocks. Yes I'm repeating myself a lot. 
1126 2018-02-19 16:14:52 Students should call out individual politicians, exc in NRA and Board members of gun manufactors. Its more about money then 2nd Ammendment rights. You'll really get results when you start hitting them in  their wallet. Imagine if moral investors stopped buying gun company stocks.
1127 2018-02-19 16:14:36 Actually bump stocks are covered under the ADA. That's why they were invented. So not sure if there's an easy fix. Plus to broad of a worded law could outlaw a lot things that don't do exactly what they do.
1128 2018-02-19 16:13:09 Bump Stocks do not change the mechanics of semi- auto firearms. They do not allow a firearm to fire machine gun style, full auto. 
It's a piece of plastic. Bump stock outrage is another fabrication of the mainstream media. Next, it will be index fingers.
1129 2018-02-19 16:12:07 Index has lost the momentum owing to back-to-back adverse events. Aftershock of the banking fraud continued to send out ripples across stocks & the risk appetite remained low.
1130 2018-02-19 16:11:47 @NRA paid legislators saying 'Oh, nothing we do can stop someone who want to do this' But that's a copout. We CAN ban assault weapons. We CAN limit multiple rounds. We CAN ban bump stocks. We CAN demand deeper background checks. And the measures WILL reduce the number of deaths.
1131 2018-02-19 16:11:19 As many as 37 stocks in the Nifty index closed in red.
1132 2018-02-19 16:09:56 Steal your clothes without asking
1133 2018-02-19 16:09:31 Limiting the size of mags is sensible. 
Gun registration with background checks is sensible.
Making bump stocks and other workarounds for auto fire illegal is sensible.
Restricting ammo purchases (eg, like pseudo-fed) is sensible.
1134 2018-02-19 16:07:53 Shower thought of the day: DRIPs are just a tax-inefficient way to turn dividend paying stocks back into non-dividend paying stocks $VIG
1135 2018-02-19 16:07:19 Haven't pulled the trigger once today. Not a good day for stocks.
1136 2018-02-19 16:06:34 #MarchForOurLives #PresidentFecalCavity Bump stocks not covered by #2A
#WeThePeople  can change the #2A so that automatic, semi-automatic and certainly other instruments of death covered as well.  Hysterical cries of "U CAN'T TAKE MY GUNS" will push tougher terms
1137 2018-02-19 16:06:19 What about history for many stocks <1996? 
1138 2018-02-19 16:05:58 Don't fall for it unless he actually commits on a signed piece of paper....this is the goon who said he is there for the dreamers and will look into bump stocks

1140 2018-02-19 16:05:36 Why hasn't that stopped assaults then if banning things works? Bump stocks might get banned, but that will be as far as that goes.

1142 2018-02-19 16:04:20 Ban bump stocks
Limit ammunition clips to 10 bullets

Bump stocks and clips are not guaranteed rights under the Constitution.
1143 2018-02-19 16:04:15 Russia's grain stocks remain heavy despite record high exports. As at 01/02, they are estimated at 42.2 mmt, 6.64 mmt or 18.7% above last year. As at 01/01, there were 45.9 mmt, 6.43 mmt or 16.3% above last year.

1146 2018-02-19 16:02:41 This is kind of fraud . Last week only u have all new stocks and this week in the name of update u removed few and added new ones. What kind of mindless update u r posting  and deceiving gullible investors. 
Don't make tall claims of 40 lakhs return against one lakh in  5 years.
1147 2018-02-19 16:01:39 Yes! Maybe... age restrictions for rifles? Parental presence when purchasing up until certain age? banning bump stocks? limiting magazine rounds? Obama rule that would've made it difficult for people with mental illness to buy guns but we NEED to start talking NOW!!!
1148 2018-02-19 16:01:12 meeee!!! i ada ready stocks
1149 2018-02-19 16:00:12 Stocks are shares of a particular company that that company sells to the public.
1150 2018-02-19 15:59:55 Without trying it, you cannot possibly know that. Besides, gun control isn't about banning guns. High capacity magazines and bump stocks? Maybe. Mostly it's about regulations that make sure you know how to safely handle and store guns, and are not a danger to yourself or others.
1151 2018-02-19 15:59:28 @ABSOLUTvodka_US I don't know if this is insider trading. However,  I should warn you that once I die, your stocks are taking a big hit.
1152 2018-02-19 15:59:04 *stocks.
1153 2018-02-19 15:59:04 The FBI admitted 2 dropping the ball, but the WH guy & Congress haven't admitted they went missing regarding assault weapons,bump stocks,etc.They r all wrong & meanwhile  teenagers, babies & adults r paying with their lives. This is disgusting. Gun culture rules, we lose!
1154 2018-02-19 15:58:40 you can bump fire a gun with a regular stock on it. there's literally no reason to ban bump stocks
1155 2018-02-19 15:58:37 Well then, if you have seen all these horrors in your admirable service, and I doff my hat to you, why would sensible gun laws that would at least outlaw the modification of rifles with bump stocks and strengthen background checks be a threat to the Second A?

1159 2018-02-19 15:57:19 I don’t know of any way to make an AR fully auto, bump stocks are still semi auto since you still have to pull the trigger every time the weapon fires.
Maybe if you were really crafty you could do it
1160 2018-02-19 15:56:19 Me also. Innocence giving NRA  ultimatum. I agree NRA should not be allowed to sway House votes or make Super PAC’s. Keep assault weapons locked away along with bump stocks.
These are weapons used to kill many, in a small amount of time! What says Sportsmanship about that. Nada.
1161 2018-02-19 15:56:02 Can’t sell drugs so I started selling stocks
1162 2018-02-19 15:55:47 Diversification is a powerful tool.  I'd like to see a more complicated example with more than two stocks and risk rates.

1165 2018-02-19 15:54:52 He also said he’d look at bump stocks as well after Los Vegas,it never happened. He says many things, but he is just a soulless vessel-empty words backed by no heart. In what universe is it appropriate to stand beside a gunshot victim’s bed with a vapid smile and . Appalling

1171 2018-02-19 15:52:53 It means all of the above.  It means the right and left get together and express all of the ideas and negotiate a way to save children's lives. Bump stocks should be banned, not guns. Majority agreed after Las Vegas but did nothing.

1178 2018-02-19 15:50:55 IMHO By April 15th, we'll see a big spikes in crypto & bitcoin/blockchain stocks. Tax returns coming in and people are looking for places to put their money.  $MGTI is my chosen bitcoin/block chain proxy.  I just hope the up list comes before everyone gets burned out.

1181 2018-02-19 15:48:47 No experience here but off the top of my head, it must have either auto, or burst, probably of a certain caliber say 556 and up, and have a certain range maybe?

1182 2018-02-19 15:48:42 @marcorubio and let's not forget it's part of the playbook. Weren't they all for banning bump stocks after LV?

1191 2018-02-19 15:45:05 I remember he also supported banning bump stocks after Vegas....#notholdingmybreath
1192 2018-02-19 15:44:44 Is Trump "open to talking about background checks" the same way that Republicans were "open to banning bump stocks" a few months ago?
1193 2018-02-19 15:44:25 In 1996, Fed's Greenspan CORRECTLY warned about "irrational exuberance" BUT DIDNT DO ENOUGH. The euphoria & insane excess in stocks & valuations WOULD EVENTUALLY CREATE one of the most painful adjustments $SPX -28% when fundamentals slowed then 9-11 then recession -49% in total.
1194 2018-02-19 15:44:19 He's lying. After the Las Vegas shooting he said that banning bump stocks was a possibility. 

Nothing happened.
1195 2018-02-19 15:44:11 Sad that it‘S the NRA that furiously fights against every form of reasonable gun safety legislation

It proved impossible to ban bump stocks, even in the wake of Trump’s Vegas massacre. They were even pushing pro-silencer legislation shortly after.

#NRABloodMoney is a root cause
1196 2018-02-19 15:43:52 Trump strikes me as the type of person who would make his second run on the basis of "Under me, gun stocks went way up! Look at those numbers!"
1197 2018-02-19 15:43:42 I agree, there should be one more dip before things really recover. I think we'll see 17k beginning of March.

1210 2018-02-19 15:40:20 Yes, I was stationed in Iceland back in 1967. As a PO2 in the Navy, I was in charge of a Ground Defense 30 Cal. machine gun team.
I have WATCHED AR-15 military assault style rifles fitted with bump stocks at shooting ranges inflict FAR MORE damage to targets than that machine gun

1213 2018-02-19 15:39:26 @realDonaldTrump Make an impact on history - ban bump stocks, ban gun sales at gun shows, ban gun sales to everyone 21 years of age and younger, 1 month waiting check period for all assault style weapons, all by Executive Order! Square up to all who seek to overturn the order!
1214 2018-02-19 15:39:25 @1a the NRA called for regulation of bump stocks after the Vegas shooting but still nothing has been done. Why?
1215 2018-02-19 15:38:10 Stocks on the rise 
1216 2018-02-19 15:38:03 Translation: ETPs are ETF's that are leveraged (with debt). They've become a big part of the market. And they could be dangerous. They don't trade like stocks or ETFs. Because they use leverage and derivatives, they could set off a cascade of selling.
1217 2018-02-19 15:37:31 @POTUS be careful of the foot-in-the -door principle! We know there are some things that can be done.I am totally in favor of background checks and banding bump stocks.However not in favor of banning assault weapons for obvious reasons.
1218 2018-02-19 15:36:31 .@SpeakerRyan when are you holding a vote to outlaw bump stocks, you coward?
1219 2018-02-19 15:36:26 Both automatic & semi automatic weapons give you the power to kill a lot of people in a short space of time, and let's not forget bump stocks. That is his point.

1222 2018-02-19 15:36:07 Funny story, he was after Las Vegas and after Texas also. Bump stocks too
1223 2018-02-19 15:35:47 Just more empty words meant to distract. They’re still selling bump stocks.
1224 2018-02-19 15:35:40 I am not a gun person, bit the AR-15 is no different than hunting rifles.  Let's ban bump stocks and high capacity magazines!
1225 2018-02-19 15:35:19 AND, they should have liability insurance, the nation should have a gun registration db, bump stocks illegal along with ar-15 type weapons & we should track quantities of ammo sold over a min amt & to whom.
1226 2018-02-19 15:34:51 And bump stocks or anything else they come up with to transform any other weapon into an assault weapon.
1227 2018-02-19 15:34:01 Thought you were a BOT but then you maligned Mr. Rogers with a dumb joke on your TL.

This “literally Hitler” is deflection. Who said this quotable? The orgs fighting for gun control? Nope. The Parkland survivors? Nope.

Background checks. Bump stocks gone. Assault rifles gone.

1235 2018-02-19 15:31:19 What about bump stocks? Easy to install and cheap. Hold the trigger down and the gun fires more rapidly than pulling the trigger 30 times. Also, an untrained shooter can not cleanly change a magazine in 1 second.

1237 2018-02-19 15:31:00 OK Marco, @SpeakerRyan and the rest of Congress, here is the help you need to get started. Bump Stocks banned, high capacity magazines banned, must be 21 to purchase any gun, much stronger background checks, reinstate legislation Trump just rolled back regarding mental illness.
1238 2018-02-19 15:30:52 They have a different supplier / transport - all stores affected. Not all are closed - just stocks are low.
1239 2018-02-19 15:30:33 Sadly  though, just banning bump stocks are not your agenda. Because most know that you don't need a bump stock to simulate the same effect, it's called bump firing. Your true goal is to ban all semi auto weapons which makes  up a high % of all weapons. We are not stupid.
1240 2018-02-19 15:28:44 No we do need gun regulations! Let’s not mix other issues in with gun regulations. No one needs bump stocks, 10 round mag max, no silencers, basic common sense stuff
1241 2018-02-19 15:28:36 How can someone fraud such big amounts without a connection ?  Fine bankers are involved what abt the documents floating for stocks / trade / company registration / transaction all over seen? #savethecountry #India only middle class n below are monitored
1242 2018-02-19 15:28:03 Improving background checks is a start. Ban weapons of mass slaughter, bump stocks, large capacity magazines, close gun show and private sale loopholes, fund gun buy back programs. Time to stop the carnage.
1243 2018-02-19 15:28:02 Bump stocks say hello
1244 2018-02-19 15:26:59 @themorningshift banning bump stocks wouldn’t have prevented the Florida shooting. Bump stocks have been used exactly once in any crime. Our gun laws in this state are stricter than most states.
1245 2018-02-19 15:26:56 I have no opinion  on bump stocks. I could care less if they go or stay. But screaming they must be banned does nothing. Working toward making or changing a law is the way to go about it.
1246 2018-02-19 15:25:55 That would be valid if not for the fact that 90% of Americans, including most gun owners, support universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole, requiring safety training, and banning AR-15s and bump stocks.
1247 2018-02-19 15:25:53 Bump Stocks are still legal
1248 2018-02-19 15:25:50 Sen. Feinstein has identified a clear target.  So let's go after bump stocks immediately.  The momentum to change our gun laws will dissipate quickly if we don't act soon.
1249 2018-02-19 15:24:59 I don’t watch Fox News. He is doing great so far. Best tax plan in Years, economy rolling, stocks still strong, trying to fix DACA
1250 2018-02-19 15:24:44 @RepBobGibbs I read your article in the Chronicle Telegram on Saturday why didn't you mention that 88 billion was buy back stocks by corporation and the people only got .003 of the corporation funds
1251 2018-02-19 15:24:34 Do not trust Trump on gun leg. He lied about helping Dreamers, getting a good health care bill, working with Russians, bump stocks & hundreds of other things. It is a distraction/gaslighting. Keep up the pressure! No words - action! #EnoughIsEnough @realDonaldTrump #FlipTheHouse
1252 2018-02-19 15:23:08 This is what’s wrong in this country. Pig headed nra people afraid to have a civil conversation about gun control. No wants to take away your right to have guns. The only thing that needs to happen is ban semi auto’s, large cap. clips and bump stocks.
1253 2018-02-19 15:22:34 Mandatory background check for purchasing any assault riffles or accessories (including bump stocks)
1254 2018-02-19 15:21:51 I don’t have issue with that. Any law abiding citizen should be able to purchase guns. I think it’s the responsibility of the potential owner to show and demonstrate that. I also believe we should ban weapons like the AR-15, high capacity clips and modifications like bump stocks

1257 2018-02-19 15:20:31 @marcorubio Both you and Sen Nelson must do something to eliminate the AR-15 and bump stocks in FL. Children being killed in school should not become the new norm.  Are you listening?
1258 2018-02-19 15:20:28 I recommend allowing gun back ground checks to include mental records.  Also a ban on any device that would make any gun into an “automatic” (I. E. Bump stocks). Most importantly, a reduction in a panic defense of the 2nd amendment every time gun regulation is discussed.
1259 2018-02-19 15:19:36 It's not just bump stocks.  They also make 50-round magazines and special triggers, and not much else.  Their entire business model is focused on mass murder.
1260 2018-02-19 15:19:24 It’s one thing that can’t be levelled at O. But you’re right. A good chunk of democrats are in with em too. They even stopped with the bump stocks after Las Vegas.
1261 2018-02-19 15:18:44 For the love of YOUR SON AND ALL OF OUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS, PLEASE stop the senseless massacres of our children!!!!

1. Stop sale of semi automatic weapons!

2. Stop sale of bump stocks or add-ons that turn guns in mass killing machines!

1265 2018-02-19 15:16:18 Remember?
GOP was going to do something about outlawing sale of bump stocks after the Vegas massacre!
Then the NRA stepped in.....and squashed any talk
1266 2018-02-19 15:16:10 Prayers of the Right are not protection.  They are not even real Christians.
The change has to be significant.  Ban Automatic Assault Weapons.  All of Them.  Ban, Bump Stocks and the like.  No more Bull Shit.
1267 2018-02-19 15:16:08 Bump stocks, I agree but it is really not an issue.  If you shoot 60 rounds per minute or 40 the degree of damage a disturbed person will cause is negligible.
1268 2018-02-19 15:14:54 Do the Right Thing Marco--it's SO SIMPLE.

1270 2018-02-19 15:14:28 @marcorubio @KamalaHarris @SenFeinstein  Something has to be done about the latest tragedy in FL.  Bump stocks have to go. The AR-15 must also be permanently banned. No American needs any weapons of war.

1272 2018-02-19 15:14:02 Whilst I'd probably not advocate a short position on European stocks with a global earnings bias (given that we're in a period of synchronised global growth), I fully agree with @RayDalio that you have to be an independent thinker who bets against consensus.
1273 2018-02-19 15:13:47 It should have been obvious the outcome when bump stocks went on sale. It was when I saw them a few years ago.

We are a reactionary species in a Condi Rice vein: 
"Who would have thought..."

Sheep reacting after enough lambs go missing.
1274 2018-02-19 15:13:14 Why the fuck are people still talking about bump stocks? A bump stock is something you attach to an "assault" rifle so it resembles an automatic weapon. The bump stock is not the issue! The issue is the weapons on the market that it's designed for... "Assault Rifles"!
1275 2018-02-19 15:12:20 Trump is allegedly supporting improvement to background checks to avoid pissing off NRA w ban on assault weapons, large capacity-magazines and bump stocks.

1282 2018-02-19 15:08:52 Exactly. I used to trade stocks, & 1 thing that's pretty consistent is when the market has big swings like a couple weeks ago it almost always preceeds a big drop. Imagine what the market will do when indictments get to higher levels, like the fake prez? Everything will get crazy
1283 2018-02-19 15:08:29 I'm your huckleberry, how about we start with a complete ban on the accessories that turn sporting guns into killing machines? Bump stocks, auto/fast reloaders, high capacity magazines, air cooled barrels, etc.
1284 2018-02-19 15:08:21 Hey Bone Spur, instead of wasting energy dissing Oprah, why not push for comprehensive background checks and outlaw bump stocks? R U owned by the NRA, as well as Putin?
1285 2018-02-19 15:08:16 Bump stocks don’t convert semiautomatic firearms into a automatic weapon.
1286 2018-02-19 15:07:53 How is an AR-15 any more dangerous than any other semi-auto rifle? (Not taking into account upgrades like high cap magazines and bump stocks).
1287 2018-02-19 15:07:43 Do you mind if we prevent teenagers from buying semi-automatic rifles and bump stocks?

1292 2018-02-19 15:07:09 Bullshit. This is like the NRA supporting limiting bump stocks in the initial wake of the Vegas shooting. They were able to dissipate a lot of criticism, but then nothing happened. The difference is that these kids don't give a fuck and are going to act until laws are passed.
1293 2018-02-19 15:06:42 Really? I believe in the 2nd amendment. I’m sure you think bump stocks should stay legal too.
1294 2018-02-19 15:06:36 You claim to be a victim of a gun crime and you owned gun stocks? What type of gun crime and when was this committed?
1295 2018-02-19 15:06:35 Heard about gun control & bump stocks but it stopped suddenly. Very odd. Little information forthcoming & yet it was horrific.
1296 2018-02-19 15:06:19 The worst are the ones who front run their picks, especially low float, thinly traded penny stocks and start to sell when they tell you to buy.
1297 2018-02-19 15:06:07 Thing.  They sent thoughts and Prayers.  Bump stocks was the talk that lasted about 1 week and NOTHING was done.  We need you and all of you to MAKE A CHange.. My heart is with you all. This isnt ACCEPTABLE!  Love from Dylan's mom in Las Vegas.

1315 2018-02-19 14:57:21 45 says he's "open" to improving background checks for gun purchases. Remember that was "open" to banning bump stocks after Vegas and literally nothing has happened in regards to bump stocks since then.

1323 2018-02-19 14:51:21 I certainly did and I will be replenishing my stocks again soon!! 
1324 2018-02-19 14:50:35 Ban on bump stocks? How about ban on military weapons to civilians
1325 2018-02-19 14:50:32 1.  Ban assault weapons
2.  Ban re-selling of assault weapons
3.  Buy-back program
3.  Ban bump stocks & high cap mags
4.  Background checks on ALL guns sold, not just from gun store
5.  No conceal carry reciprocity
6.  Require safety test and registration like a driver's license
1326 2018-02-19 14:49:31 Whatever happened to the promise to ban bump stocks? Three months later and the carnage of Las Vegas is completely forgotten.
1327 2018-02-19 14:48:49 Nope. This isn’t about background checks. This is about guns. Types of guns & accessories—& ease of access/availability. Reinstate #AssaultWeaponsBan -include bump stocks, magazines & other weapons of mass destruction. Include mandatory training tests for any gun ownership.
1328 2018-02-19 14:48:29 the side of the current gun laws. Just a little common sense would go a long way!! Gun reform is always pushed away but it can't anymore. Bump stocks, automatics, gun show loophole, online purchases,mental health checks(which dipshit EO'd Obama's policy).. Just a start

1331 2018-02-19 14:47:12 I've also personally spoken to Pennsylvanians who are pretty much living paycheck to paycheck, know for a fact that Trump was abysmally unqualified for POTUS before the election, and voted for him anyway because "their stocks will be great!".

1332 2018-02-19 14:46:47 Very interesting oversight by the investing community to not put enough value on churn (outside of de-valuing stocks upon weak financial earnings that were really just a derivative of huge churn). Have you looked into buyer intent data to identify clients at risk of churn?
1333 2018-02-19 14:43:59 wow BFD, we need more. Ban automatic and semiauto guns, bump stocks, 14day waiting period, no internet &show sales
1334 2018-02-19 14:43:26 Kasich says ban bump stocks. Easy instructions for making a bump stock are readily found on the Internet. We don’t need more excess laws.
1335 2018-02-19 14:43:20 With all due respect Senator,
We need to go beyond merely “strengthening our gun laws”. We need to ban assault rifles and bump stocks outright. Period. End of story.

1337 2018-02-19 14:42:45 Bump stocks don’t make guns full auto, age limit doesn’t matter anybody can still get one, and mag limit is useless I know guys that can reload faster than most can shoot.  Stupid...
1338 2018-02-19 14:42:23 He was also open to banning bump stocks but has moved on to being threatened by Oprah...

1340 2018-02-19 14:41:44 If you mention the name of stocks then your this tweet will be really helpful for your followers. Otherwise nothing new to appreciate in this tweet.
1341 2018-02-19 14:41:34 Of course they do. They're British. They come from a long line of allowing themselves to be controlled by the government, whatever form it takes.

I'm surprised they haven't reimplementing the stocks yet for "thought criminals".
1342 2018-02-19 14:41:24 A good point to start after the Las Vegas disaster was banning bump stocks. Were not dealing with reasonable people so don’t count on it...
1343 2018-02-19 14:41:03 The right of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for the people.
1344 2018-02-19 14:40:57 That is certainly one thing I would like to see. Also a minimum age for purchasing guns. And no assault-rifles and bump stocks.

I'm in favor of personal ownership of handguns and similar weapons; I can even give real-life situations where that was very important.
1345 2018-02-19 14:40:11 I'd be fine with all of that except for magazine size, since everything but that addresses people and not things. Bump stocks essentially make these things full-auto, which has been against the law for years. They shouldn't be allowed. ATF will probably deal with them.
1346 2018-02-19 14:39:04 I like lithium.  Just timing for stocks.  That whole SQM thing threw the equity investors off. Looking like things are setting up again.  I only own PLU.V atm in that space.

1355 2018-02-19 14:34:33  you have gun stocks? Was this before or after lie about being a victim of gun violence? Or is it just another lie?
1356 2018-02-19 14:34:27 Most gun violence is done via hand guns; bump stocks are just stupid & actually make the weapon less accurate;  the age limit can be argued; background checks are nice but criminals don't care; mag limits are silly as a trained shooter can easily mags (the delay is like 3 secs)
1357 2018-02-19 14:33:26 He is being a politician, unfortunately. How about start with making assault rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks (war weaponry) illegal. Then anyone that owns said weapons have X amount of time to turn into a Govt buy back program or criminal possession afterward.
1358 2018-02-19 14:33:25 Obama legalised bump stocks. Just sayin.
1359 2018-02-19 14:33:10 GW bush let the assault weapons ban run out in 2004.  Assault weapons, bump stocks, gun show loopholes, easy access to guns, loose gun laws---they are the problem.  Don't you dare blame this on the kids (or facebook or whatever your point was).

1363 2018-02-19 14:32:40 As of right now they are a constitutional right. Should they be - no but the likelyhood of outlawing them is near zero. How about changing the age to 21, more background checks including mental health and criminal record, outlawing bump stocks and limiting magazine size.
1364 2018-02-19 14:32:23 So buy gun stocks now?
1365 2018-02-19 14:31:53 Anyone have a good podcast on stocks and investing?
1366 2018-02-19 14:31:46 I agree with you @piersmorgan! @realDonaldTrump most of America agrees that semi automatic weapons and bump stocks should be illegal! The 2A does not mean unlimited types of guns and ammo, we need to update!!!
1367 2018-02-19 14:31:22 New stocks available 

1368 2018-02-19 14:31:06 Yeah, he'll act like he's for it then get people like spineless Paul Ryan to run interference until the bill is dead. 

See: bump stocks

1370 2018-02-19 14:30:52 To celebrate president day and in salute to Trump, Slide Fire Solutions, a bump stocks manufacturer, is offering 10% off its products, this is the same quick fire device the Las Vegas shooter used on his rifle. Its no new that this shooting has increased in this administration.

1374 2018-02-19 14:29:02 I might add that i 100% support banning devices like bumb stocks purely aimed at circumventing regulations on full autos. Not that itd have prevented the shooting but likely reduced casualties.
1375 2018-02-19 14:28:03 We need assault rifles, bump stocks banned, any weaponry used by the military should not be in the hands of any civilian.
1376 2018-02-19 14:27:49 Also said he was open to banning bump stocks and that never happened
1377 2018-02-19 14:27:28 Congress needs to pass laws that takes assault weapons/bump stocks etc. away from public consumption! Enforce mandatory registration of assault weapons that are in pubic hands today and make failure to do so a criminal offense! Maximize security at all schools!
1378 2018-02-19 14:27:21 I am a 20 year military guy, gun owner, father to 3 beautiful children, son to a beautiful mother, husband to a beautiful wife.   If you're like me, and believe AR-15's (ONLY), bump stocks, etc should be banned outright, does that make you  CC:  @CNN @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump
1379 2018-02-19 14:27:10 Too little too late we need a ban on AR15 and all loopholes to buy and make from online and NO bump stocks
1380 2018-02-19 14:27:01 You are right, some Republican CITIZENS want gun reform. 

But Cameron, NOW that you have the world’s attention, and the GOP is scared of losing their seats, they may “say” they’re wanting change, but BEWARE of a wolf in sheeps clothing. Remember what they did re: bump stocks.
1381 2018-02-19 14:26:35 4. I would be ok with making bump stocks illegal, however, they are pretty easy to make. 5. What would be the requirements for a license be? 6. I am all for child locks/safety
1382 2018-02-19 14:26:09 That’s a pathetic piece of BS propagated by the vile NRA they’re praying on your fears with conspiracy theories!! Nobody wants all your guns! Just those meant only for the military and law enforcement! No one needs a gun like that and nothing that alters a gun aka stocks
1383 2018-02-19 14:25:27 Woke up thinking about investing in stocks, especially in the beauty industry, yes I want in! #makeupislife
1384 2018-02-19 14:25:14 I'm in $VSLR for the long run along with some others these Solar stocks too cheap #Invest
1385 2018-02-19 14:25:05 You people are so funny with your "law-abiding" nonsense. The LV shooter was "law-abiding" until the very moment he opened fire killing 57 people and injuring hundreds. Is that what you are protecting? His right to possess semi-autos with bump stocks?
1386 2018-02-19 14:24:45 Gun control=no bump stocks,no AR15 or the like,limited clips,weapons and ammo registered,fully funded mental health services,strict background checks,no ourchase of any weapons under age 25.
1387 2018-02-19 14:23:55 Markets rebound as stocks enjoy strong weekly gains. Stocks recovered from correction territory with a vengeance last week. The major indices are back in the green for the year as concerns over rising rates subsided a bit and corporate earnings continued to surprise to the upside
1388 2018-02-19 14:23:54 Bump stocks do not make a weapon automatic or mimic automatic fire. And that’s a great analogy... if murder wasn’t already illegal. 
And still no solutions. Only outrage.
1389 2018-02-19 14:23:20 I would add serialize ghost gun components, ban bump stocks, and keep the ban on silencers.
1390 2018-02-19 14:22:54 Time to sell stocks and take a vacation
1391 2018-02-19 14:22:13 Just like he was going to do something about bump stocks following Las Vegas.
1392 2018-02-19 14:22:09 I love it, too. I hate that they cut one of the best parts out, though. "Chaucer's" speech at the stocks (likely cut because of length, as well as the caliber of the acting compared to the rest) is a great one-man show for Paul Bettany.
1393 2018-02-19 14:22:06 Just like he supported banning bump stocks? How is that legislation doing BTW?
1394 2018-02-19 14:21:39 Yeah. Just like the bump stocks. And we see where that went.

1396 2018-02-19 14:19:42 What about assault rifles? What about bump stocks? How about raising the age for buying any gun to 21?

1400 2018-02-19 14:18:56 Here's a random thought:
1) increase the length of time the FBI has for background checks.
2) background checks for all purchases, include Gun Shows & private.
3) bump stocks, armor piercing bullets, banned
4) All semi-automatics banned
5) conversion kits illegal
1401 2018-02-19 14:18:51 The worst shooting was Vegas, under trump and the republicans are trying to make jump stocks and suppressors legal. They’re all on the NRA payroll
1402 2018-02-19 14:18:50 Invested half my retirement fund into Chipotle stocks, RIP.

1405 2018-02-19 14:18:19 @RandPaul Ban assault rifles and bump stocks.
1406 2018-02-19 14:18:19 This is another of their tactics. After Las vegas they were open to banning bump stocks and appeared to be swayed. As we know, that was BS! Keep it up until it is written into law.
1407 2018-02-19 14:18:13 That tax cut helped the companies and rich CEOs who took their money to purchase MORE stocks which makes it look like an economic surge. Not real economic growth.
1408 2018-02-19 14:18:03 My point I say again and again is not do "something, anything" but specifically, reauthorize the Assault Weapons Ban; include bump stocks and AR-15's.
1409 2018-02-19 14:17:10 Why don't we stay focused on what's going on in this country. DACA, banning assault weapons and bump stocks, Russians messing with our election, keeping SS and Medicare funded, getting money out of politics and so on. We have our own problems. Focus please!
1410 2018-02-19 14:16:47 He will listen to the children of GOP faithful with no dissenters there.  Its not just about background checks, close trade show loopholes, outlaw bump stocks and silencers, more data in the database, flag the mentally ill, require safer storage if minors in house, think smart!
1411 2018-02-19 14:15:38 Maybe only allowing "gun collectors" who go through a deeper background check buy them and no more than 2 plus no bump stocks could reduce the number. Too.
1412 2018-02-19 14:15:16 on #TheNews at 8,now Rotomac scam valued at 3,695 crores,govt bank stocks fall,hate videos by Raj killer from jail & Imran Khan shaadi no 3

1414 2018-02-19 14:14:30 love phone baby old yes
1415 2018-02-19 14:14:25 The argument that criminals won't give up their guns is off topic for the most part. You won't see as many mass shootings like this if some military rifles, bump stocks and large capacity guns with clips were banned.
1416 2018-02-19 14:13:00 @JoeNBC showing his true colors again by suggesting maybe it’s time for universal background checks, banning bump stocks, banning access to some types of weapons but finishing by voicing his commitment to “gun rights.” Still a supporter of Gingrich’s contract on America.
1417 2018-02-19 14:12:41 This man also said he'd look into bump stocks and he did nada
1418 2018-02-19 14:12:25 Not even close, ban all military style guns, assult weapons and bump stocks for civilians and impose strict background checks in that order. Those guns are not for hunting but for slaughter
1419 2018-02-19 14:11:43 Agree! Both sides need to take blame then step up & solve problems...1) taking NRA 4 votes 2) BAN assault rifles and bump stocks .. NOW
1420 2018-02-19 14:11:19 言えるのはショートは怖くてできないな。てか、今日外したばっかだし。
1421 2018-02-19 14:10:41 At nagkakaubusan na ng stocks sa BBW malamang wala na don yung mga gusto ko. Haaaayyyy im dyiiiiing
1422 2018-02-19 14:09:42 That’s not nearly enough. He and the GOP didn’t shift towards banning bump stocks or reinstating the Assault Weapons Ban after Vegas, so his words without action are meaningless.
1423 2018-02-19 14:09:36 @SpeakerRyan NEED GUN LAWS, 85 % OF AMERICANS WANT GUN LAWS ! CT GUN LAWS WORKING, MONICIDES DOWN 40 %. TAKE AUTO WEAPONS, BUMP STOCKS ( WHICH TURN REGULAR GUNS INTO AUTO ) THEM OFF THE MARKET ! ADD MENTAL HEALTH REGULATIONS GOOD, BUT NOT ENOUGH ! NO AUTO GUNS NO MASS SHOOTINGS !
1424 2018-02-19 14:09:35 Assault weapons should be banned. The AR 15 along with bump stocks have no business in civilian hands. Keep hunting rifles and hand guns. Why is that a problem?
1425 2018-02-19 14:08:48 #redminote5pro... Just curious.... In how many seconds will the stocks be sold out?
@manukumarjain @RedmiIndia #RedmiNote5Pro
1426 2018-02-19 14:08:39 What would be great is if stocks in gun companies fell sharply when the NYSE opened today. #GunControlNow
1427 2018-02-19 14:08:35 Just a doubt. I went thru CCI 34 strategy and selected a random stock called Pgel. it has given 3x wen cci 34 was 50 the price was 120 and wen cci 300 the stock hit 460. Question is how do we screen such stocks. Because I queried in chartink and got few stocks but those Cci 1/2
1428 2018-02-19 14:08:27 I would be willing to give up fish (As in the UK bans it) for 5 years (With fishmen receiving a state wage to compensate, even pay them to look after the sea... help clean up oceans) to replenish UK fish stocks.

I know they swim about, but I want our shores to become a heaven
1429 2018-02-19 14:07:49 Pour du matériel et des consommables pour #FabLab notamment : le magasin "Loisirs & création" de Bercy Village (Paris 13e) continue de liquider ses stocks et ceux de l'enseigne. Fermeture définitive du magasin et de l'enseigne le 17 mars.
1430 2018-02-19 14:07:22 When interviewing mgmt teams of #microcap #stocks you want to buy  make sure to ask questions about their core values, personal struggles & obstacles they've hurdled along their journey. More challenges will pop up in the future.
1431 2018-02-19 14:07:11 Ban assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. You can keep your bolt action hunting rifles, pistols and shotguns. The essence of the second amendment is preserved and society, especially our children, are protected from mayhem.
1432 2018-02-19 14:06:42 You too!  Stop the Tweets and work on a ban on assault weapons and bump stocks! We need better background checks and to close gun show loopholes. The Second Amendment will not be eroded!  Please protect the children!!
1433 2018-02-19 14:06:28 The causes I've been focusing on for last month or so reaffirms my long standing belief: the greatest assets are not money, or stocks or property, but people.

People helping out one another is an amazing thing.  #feelinggrateful
1434 2018-02-19 14:05:19 Banning bump stocks isn't enough.  We need to outlaw gun shows, background check overhaul, and bring back assault weapons ban.  Be loud.  Be heard.
1435 2018-02-19 14:04:03 Because trump revoked Obama’s initiative blocking gun sales to the mentally unfit. He did nothing with bump stocks. He took millions from the NRA. He has cut budgets for mental health care by reducing Medicaid. Cut budgets for school safety. Do you kind of get it now?
1436 2018-02-19 14:02:18 With stocks, it’s always “up the escalator, down the elevator shaft”.  This is why risk management is so important.  Allow yourself to get stopped out of positions at the proper time.
1437 2018-02-19 14:01:14 In October he was open to banning bump stocks too. We see how that’s gone. #BanAssaultWeaponsNow #schoolshooting #GunContolNow #Parkland
1438 2018-02-19 14:01:04 I just want people to be safer; AR-15s and bump stocks need a permanent ban.Military style weapons require special training that Joe6-pack who might mentally unstable doesn't possess, hell I couldn't handle one without through training; my father was military not me.LTB #VegasSho

1445 2018-02-19 13:58:58 How is banning assault rifles and bump stocks attacking your second amendment rights?  No one who hunts or intends to protect their home needs multiple round shooting devices.  Period.  Will it stop all gun deaths?  Of course not.  Will it help?  Of course it will.
1446 2018-02-19 13:58:55 Until there is a tweet, I'm going to have to assume that this is just this WH trying to make it seem like he is hearing the concerns of millions. Many are tired of lip service intended only to appease us for the short term (bump stocks anyone?).

1452 2018-02-19 13:54:10 If the EU had not created fish catches there would be NO fish left. I am old enough to remember the almost zero stock of cod and very low stock of haddock. The rigid fishing rules allowed the stocks to be as good as they are today
1453 2018-02-19 13:54:03 I don't know about tiny market - you're only looking here at home. 30% of South Koreans own some cryptocurrency. Only 52% of Americans own stocks - that is pretty substantial.

1456 2018-02-19 13:52:18 “Supportive of efforts” ? So a pantomime of action from @gop but same result as bump stocks.
1457 2018-02-19 13:51:36 Thank your inspiring talk @DrSteveSimpson at Arup. Can you answer these questions 1. Which are good alternatives for someone wanting to eat fish from sustainable stocks? 2. Is there any best practice on sustainable levels of consumption of fish e.g. once a week?
1458 2018-02-19 13:51:22 I don't understand why people feel the need to be so rampy on stocks. Just let the business do its thing and people will follow. You will never find the stock market not valuing a company correctly in the long run. Valuation and share price meet sooner or later
1459 2018-02-19 13:51:11 Metal and mining stocks declined. JSW Steel lost 2.97%, Steel Authority  of India (Sail) 1.3%, Hindustan Copper 2.16%, National Aluminium Company  2.36%, Hindustan Zinc 0.22%. Jindal Steel & Power 0.64%, and NMDC  1.83%. Hindalco Industries 0.32% and Vedanta rose 0.33%.

1461 2018-02-19 13:50:03 The usual cycle has started up in the wake of the shooting - A mutual noted that SSK, who manufactures bump stocks for AR15's, AK47's, etc, is giving 10% off to folks who type MAGA in as a coupon code today to buy their products.  Look for a spike in weapons and ammo sales.
1462 2018-02-19 13:50:03 PSU bank stocks continued to bleed following detections of frauds in  some psu banks. State Bank of India was down 1.51%, Dena Bank 4.43%,  Canara Bank 1.3%, and United Bank of India fell 2.36%.
1463 2018-02-19 13:48:43 It must include reinstating #AssaultWeaponsBan including bump stocks, magazines & other weapons of mass destruction. Institute buyback program with jailtime for noncompliance. Enough is enough. Stop going for what is NRA “safe” & go for what is human safe! Thank you!
1464 2018-02-19 13:48:33 Capital goods stocks edged lower. BEML was down 2.47%, ABB India 1.92%,  Bharat Electronics 1.29%, Bharat Heavy Electricals (Bhel) 1.06%, and  Siemens fell 2.31%. Punj Lloyd was up 0.49% and Thermax rose 1.82%.

1478 2018-02-19 13:41:46 Yet Obama did absolutely nothing when he had an 100 % control.
Beyond that his administration ok'd bump stocks.
But facts do not matter.
The system failed to not flag this kid. Facts matter.
1479 2018-02-19 13:41:29 Yes ..Did home work ..Just tempted to buy few more kept on my watchlist ...Just a thought ...Buying stocks is giving me a feeling of hunting ..Tracking it down before going on the counter to buy :(  something is wrong or its just I am learning things patiently..?
1480 2018-02-19 13:41:26 Greater yes, but still still totally overpowered. Our munitions stocks would be expended in days
1481 2018-02-19 13:40:20 If I am not mistaken, the Supreme Court defined the people as a well trained militia, “the right to bear arms shall not be infringed”. That does not mean bump stocks, large magazines etc. There can certainly be some reasonable restrictions and stay within the 2nd. amendment.
1482 2018-02-19 13:38:21 Be very sure of the 8. Don’t add stocks for the sake of doing it. Be very selective in what you add to your list.
1483 2018-02-19 13:37:58 When do you expect the others to get stocks!!! My local still not on your open list, and I'm getting Peckish
1484 2018-02-19 13:36:43 Talking to financial planner Friday who said fund managers aren't recommending investment in any UK stocks right now; all outside mainly Europe. UK is already missing out on much-needed investment and we haven't even left EU yet!
1485 2018-02-19 13:36:38 Attn #Resistance and #GunControlNow PEEPS! Look for CONGRESS to give a gun control bill that DOES NOT  include BANNING AR-15 or BUMP stocks! Hey will throw a crumb, because the NRA pays them to bullshit & appease USA with minimal bills. They need to BAN them!
1486 2018-02-19 13:36:32 @realDonaldTrump  
We need COMPLETE congressional DISCUSSION, NOW, re  SHOOTINGS:
(1) Stronger gun background checks, 
(2) A ban on bump stocks, &
(3) Assurances that military-style weapons stop finding their way to terrorists,            domestic abusers, and the mentally ill!
1487 2018-02-19 13:36:26 I have a question ..? How many stocks to start with in a portfolio for long term investing ?? Holding 8 so far buying them slowly in the fall .. Appreciate your guidance here .
1488 2018-02-19 13:36:20 penge wala akong stocks dito
1489 2018-02-19 13:35:50 What, exactly, is this legislation, sir?  Are you trying to ban semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, and armor piercing rounds? Because any legislation that doesn't ban these things is going to be, for the most part, useless.
1490 2018-02-19 13:35:49 Only for 100 pesos each guys! Palit namo guys, limited stocks lang 
1491 2018-02-19 13:35:07 many drug makers have stock buyback this year, the sector could gain strength. metal stocks are strong since Q4 last year.
1492 2018-02-19 13:34:28 @JonathanTjarks Why are we so willing to give the Warriors a pass and say "they're waiting for the playoffs" but assert that LeBron can't takeover like he used to? 2017 Finals stats (his last meaningful games): 33.6, 12, 10, 2.4 "stocks." That's insane.

1494 2018-02-19 13:34:02 “Supportive of efforts” ? So a pantomime of action from @gop but same result as bump stocks.
1495 2018-02-19 13:33:07 I greatly prefer the beauty of wood stocks myself
1496 2018-02-19 13:33:00 Trump together with the  Republican Party have been bought by the NRA , he may listen “sympathetically”. but he won’t do any gun reform .  They are still selling bump stocks after Vegas massacre
1497 2018-02-19 13:32:24 Currently I focus on US markets because there is a larger universe of stocks for the bot to watch. However trade-ideas dose have Canadian data.

1502 2018-02-19 13:27:22 @karenhandel I support legislation to make it harder to be allowed to obtain guns, AR-15s, and also banning bump stocks.   And btw, if you accepted money from the NRA you won’t be re-elected.
1503 2018-02-19 13:26:20 Bro, Stopped posting Tomorrow checklist of stocks nowadays? Or Waiting for market to get into normal mode?
1504 2018-02-19 13:26:16 Ban AR’s , ban bump stocks—these things will still happen as long as anyone can easily walk in the front door of most schools in America.
1505 2018-02-19 13:25:50 Kinda sad how Primark never stocks any Hufflepuff things, why is it always the one which is forgotten about, there's four houses not three!
1506 2018-02-19 13:25:32 Diary: I walk into my brothers wicker park apartment. He’s 21 and a finance major. He pulls up his emails and the stocks on one screen and Eric Andre on the other. Cracks open a Red Bull and a coors light. Is this what real college is like?
1507 2018-02-19 13:25:28 Di na ako umabot sa stocks  I went there around 1-3pm then bumalik pa ako ng around 5 kasi nagwait ako magopen ng another box wala na daw talaga  pero thank you so much!!!
1508 2018-02-19 13:25:21 I don’t think we should be allowed to have bump stocks or automatic weapons. But I don’t believe in banning a gun when we have a mental health issue.
1509 2018-02-19 13:24:22 Ban the bump stocks!!!
#waronguns
1510 2018-02-19 13:23:00 why won't you bring a vote on bump stocks and background checks? @SenMajLdr @SpeakerRyan
1511 2018-02-19 13:22:34 It's good to hear from someone not cheerleading for keeping a huge mortgage. Risks matter. Interest rates can rise, stocks can crash, and people can lose jobs.

1513 2018-02-19 13:21:52 Its not hard to personally divest either.  Mutual funds disclose their holdings.  There are broad based funds that specifically do not include fossil fuels. There are sector funds and of course individual stocks.  I was able to do this within my company's 401(k)

Allow people to take NRA to court. This was removed by congress. Put it back. Make bump stocks illegal. Everyone should Have a background check done. DO YOUR FUCKING JOB FOR A CHANGE
1518 2018-02-19 13:19:45 #2 buying Congressmen and Senators who refuse to enact universal background checks, who do enact bills allowing the mentally ill access to guns, who refuse to ban bump stocks and other accessories that convert weapons to automatic, refuse to increase funding for mental health.

1521 2018-02-19 13:18:44 To  Far Right: do u need high capacity mags, bump stocks, et al  in a rifle? Different rules for different firearms? To both sides mental health care sucks in this country and it’s getting worse. Yeah absolutey #dosomething stop telling us won’t work and figure it out. Do yer job
1522 2018-02-19 13:18:04 I don’t disagree. Bump stocks and high capacity magazines don’t serve a purpose to me other than to turn a legal gun into an illegal one through a loop hole. This should be amended. One shouldn’t be able to easily modify a gun to make it illegal.
1523 2018-02-19 13:17:50 @Morning_Joe Who in their right mind could possibly believe this mad man could b serious abt gun control , gun stocks  give me a break . He is a desperate man running from the law , he might say anything . He doesn't care abt those kids , this country , only cares abt himself .

1525 2018-02-19 13:17:41 Slippery slope? First you just wanted background checks then bump stocks now assault rifle ban. Slippery slope?
1526 2018-02-19 13:17:39 Yes, sorry about that John - we were a bit taken aback by demand; particularly for cask! We were able to replenish stocks a couple of times. We’ll know better next time!
1527 2018-02-19 13:17:30 Reform does't take away guns. Restrictions need to be placed on the sale of military level weapons and enhancements like bump stocks & high caliber armor piercing bullets. This won't affect the hand gun in the bedside table or the hunting rifle in the gun cabinet. #GunControlNow

1532 2018-02-19 13:14:44 Ok here it goes. NOTHING will come of this shooting in #Florida - Nothing. Not 1 damn thing. Kids - go ahead miss school. It won't mean anything.  #LasVegasShooting happened and no bill to stop bump stocks. #SandyHook and no bill. We have reversed laws for mentally ill
1533 2018-02-19 13:14:37 The use of bump-stocks—FEMA serving candy as me….
1534 2018-02-19 13:12:13 Shall I start with getting out of the CFP, a dreadful piece of work which is murdering our fish stocks?
1535 2018-02-19 13:12:07 How many of AR are used in school shootings?  It’s for a reason.  You probably support bump stocks too
1536 2018-02-19 13:10:45 I love how no one presses the Brewers for answers. Stearns always giving nothing in his answers. I mean I get the local media has to play nice, but that is an absolute joke of an answer on Odorizzi. Every team has a process David.
1537 2018-02-19 13:10:38 Congress in general it's not GOP or Dems it's both. How many in Congress hold stocks in RX
1538 2018-02-19 13:10:35 Ban weapons of mass slaughter. Ban bump stocks. Ban large capacity magazines. Close private and gun show sales loopholes. Fund a gun buy back program. As a start. Worked in Australia. To do nothing is criminal.
1539 2018-02-19 13:09:39 LOL that’s not how stocks work. He bought a few multimillion dollar homes, so that would be impossible. If it was that easy, don’t you think everyone would do it? You see nothing suspicious? Why did he fly billions to Iran in unmarked planes? Why not give a check?

1551 2018-02-19 13:00:26 .. with or without bump stocks, our country had a bill regarding guns & mental health yet Trump REPEALED it!
1552 2018-02-19 12:58:22 Reminds me of the old stock market joke.

How to have a million dollars in stocks.

Start with two million dollars.
1553 2018-02-19 12:57:00 Ban them? There are 5 million in circulation in this country. Even if we never made another one the current ones will be around for a century or more. I think the discussion will focus on bump stocks and high capacity magazines (which won't help either).
1554 2018-02-19 12:54:50 There are a number of mutual funds that exclude ATF stocks as well as many other bad actors-a handful of co. names here: Domini, Ariel, Eaton Vance/Calvert, Pax World.
1555 2018-02-19 12:53:38 As long as people ask have the PSU & private bank stocks bottomed? 
1556 2018-02-19 12:52:17 And because these banana republics did it, the US is sure to follow if bump stocks are banned. “The guvnmint is comin’ to take yer guns!”

Your thread is paranoid hooey. No one wants full confiscation. Many countries have gun laws and also don’t round up and kill their citizens.

Si vous osez ?
1561 2018-02-19 12:50:22 In my opinion, we should move away from the term “gun control.” What I personally want to see is 1) Background check req’d for every gun purchase; 2) Ban on automatic & semi-automatic guns & bump stocks, at the very least.
1562 2018-02-19 12:49:28 So the fool thinks MJ stocks are a bad investment ... ok... so based on their track record then it must be an ideal time to load up on them now I suppose 
1563 2018-02-19 12:48:51 Stocks are entering a new era given the recent corrective action, and it is possible that we will see more downside volatility in the days and weeks ahead.

1586 2018-02-19 12:31:47 Please explain it to me, how will banning bump stocks will solve the mental issue of these blood thirsty terrorists?  If it's not this gun, they will use something else. Just look at Europe, they have the strictest gun laws, but it does not deter mental people from killing.

1593 2018-02-19 12:29:56 In fact, I'm glad you mentioned that, I've never looked at it from that angle before. If Mr. Paddock wasn't the best advertiser for bump fire stocks on this green Earth, who is? (Probably some other terrorist.)
1594 2018-02-19 12:29:10 be keen to know if you found one - we need one for ASX stocks
1595 2018-02-19 12:28:57 In Australia, in 1996 they had a massacre and 35 were killed. The very next day they banned semi automatic weapons. Since then they have had no massacres.  They just need to ban the semi automatic weapons and bump stocks. Childrens lives are worth more than any gun.
1596 2018-02-19 12:28:17 It's era of artificial intelligence to trade stocks.
The person will continue to increase the money without having to work even one second.
1597 2018-02-19 12:26:27 My wages and stocks have gone up. The Dems did not even vote to give that to the middle class. I will be thankful for the “little” the republicans gave us. For the Dems gave us 0. And all in the name of politics
1598 2018-02-19 12:26:19 They can't fly but they can still get a gun. That is messed up. Ban bump stocks, ban silencers.

1601 2018-02-19 12:24:14 Sensible gun laws does not infringe the law but it reduces the possibility that guns find their way in the hands of mentally unbalanced people and that even if they do on occasion with no assult riles and bump stocks less will be harmed
1602 2018-02-19 12:24:06 The perk of being from a small company is you can do sajaegi and no one gives a f*CK so you can Media play all you want. That's exactly what bighit is doing right now. Big3 has too many antis and their stocks are public, so they can't do anything illegal.
1603 2018-02-19 12:21:28 I was referring to rifles. Bump stocks really have no purpose.  I can understand doing away with those.

1609 2018-02-19 12:17:43 Oh goody, Mr. A Rating From The NRA wants action. How about actually regulating semi-automatic weapons, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks and other things with literally no legitimate civilian purpose?

1617 2018-02-19 12:15:02 This is disturbing. Democrats have been trying to pass gun control for decades, and the NRA refuses to do anything - they wouldn’t even ban bump stocks after Vegas. The NRA is holding this country hostage for crazies like you. #GunControlNow

1626 2018-02-19 12:07:50 Most people aren’t suggesting the “banning” of guns they are suggesting gun control. There is no necessity for semi automatic weapons for the self defence argument your people continually spout. Bump stocks shouldn’t be in the hands of civilians and why would you repeal a law re
1627 2018-02-19 12:07:17 I don't think stripping all guns from gun owners is part of the discussion. The focus now seems to be stricter background checks (esp. for mental illness), banning bump stocks and limiting access to semi-automatic weapons.

1734 2018-02-19 10:47:49 The children were right. The adults are not listening. It is now up to the young people to set things right. I cannot fathom any reason why bump stocks are still being manufactured and sold.

1739 2018-02-19 10:44:12 I have a few friends who had to run down stocks & apply for the new licensing schedule, and it's mentioned in there, it was enlightening current debate not sidetracking it., sorry if that wasn't clear. I use CBD products, have for a couple of years now.
1740 2018-02-19 10:43:51 We all have different investment strategies. I generally only hold 5-6 stocks. Lithium stocks have, or are, peaking. I don’t like holding to production either [orphan period etc]. I prefer early plays with at least 12 months of growth [10 bag+] potential. Diversity also key.

1772 2018-02-19 10:17:13 This is so spot on.  I am a Proud native of NH and believe in responsible gun ownership.  I do not believe in assault rifles outside of police and military regulated uses.  We need Gun Safety Reform for our kids and families.  Oh yeah, get rid of bump stocks too.

1782 2018-02-19 10:10:21 Machine guns/full autos are regulated by ATF & take 8-12 months & $25,000 to get. An AR-15 is not an automatic weapon. Agree with you on bump stocks. I’ve done a lot of research seeking to understand AR-15 compared to other guns. I was surprised at what I learned.

Will look at the efficiency of my trading ie say can I achieve the same targets with reduced capital, the broker fees, cutting stocks that are not performing in line with expectations etc
1792 2018-02-19 10:02:02 I'm still in disbelief that bump stocks are still a thing. I expected them to be thrown under the bus as a sacrifice to protect guns like the AR-15, but I sadly underestimated the capacity for American legislature to do nothing.

1990 2018-02-19 07:16:56 I don't want to ban the 2nd amendment. Just high capacity magazines. No more than ten rounds per magazine. Let's make it a little more difficult for killers to kill. I support armed officers at schools too. Let's also ban bump stocks.
1991 2018-02-19 07:16:02 I would never want to ban all guns. Those who draw that conclusion should take a step back & listen. These actions seem reasonable to me:
• Ban bump stocks.
• Ban assault rifles.
• Background checks at gun shows.
My dad taught me to shoot when I was 5. I don’t need an AR.

1996 2018-02-19 07:12:32 The Constitution doesn’t exist of one super amendment & 9 suggestions. Your right to amass an endless supply of ammo, bump stocks etc. doesn’t supersede anyone else’s right to not have every cowardly imbecile w/ paranoia & sense of inadequacy armed to the teeth in their midst.
1997 2018-02-19 07:11:50 I guess a lot of people still look at cryptos with the mentality of investing in stocks where even a 5% dip feels like a disaster.
1998 2018-02-19 07:10:45 NOT just assault rifles. Look at the bump stocks used in Vegas.

2000 2018-02-19 07:09:41 Were any of the above, other than guns, specifically designed to kill? Are any of them, other than guns, marketed specifically for the lethal nature they possess? Or have accessories designed specifically to make them more deadly, such as bump stocks? THAT is why.

2012 2018-02-19 06:56:39 Broadly i tend to agree with you. but always buying highly priced stocks may not apply high quality always, like every small stock or co is not junk. investors have negative bias on stock/cos due to their size, which may hold them back from some great cos. to each his own

2015 2018-02-19 06:55:22 America isn't split on banning semi-auto, bump stocks, etc. The responsible owners are generally fine with it. I mean, they're for murdering people in large numbers. We're hitting a tipping point. Gun violence is worse than it's ever been because we have more guns than ever.

2025 2018-02-19 06:48:37 There's thousands and thousands in circulation now.  Guess not selling new ones would be better than if their numbers continued to swell, but it sure wouldn't stop crazies from using them to, well, assault people.  Same with "bump stocks".
2026 2018-02-19 06:47:59 Market falls to test your patience in the stocks you are holding. Reminds me of the time when mr. Jhunjhunwala bought spicejet and it lost 30%
And mr. Kedia bought Atul auto and after 2008 crash it went half. And both of them still made good money out of it by holding them. 

2027 2018-02-19 06:47:49 And high capacity magazines. And bump stocks.
2028 2018-02-19 06:47:02 Well it is common phenomena in business...
You can't sell 100% goods
You need to have high stocks compare to sell
In this case it is 40% sell thru.

It is like garment showroom... An average 300sqft store keep inventory of 1500 units and sell 300 units monthly basis

However, i doubt any law would have prevented this. Small possibility he would have been caught buying illegally. That's it.

2041 2018-02-19 06:29:59 Since ARs and other assault weapons are by far the most deadly and are becoming the weapon of choice for virtually all mass shootings, it's time we ban them again.  Also, ban bump-fire stocks, high capacity mags for anything but rimfire, and background checks for all purchases.

2085 2018-02-19 06:01:29 I think some legislation regulating bump stocks makes sense. After that, it’s a slippery slope becuase it is the magazine that makes the gun “high capacity”, not the gun itself.  I can get high capacity magazines for a .22 long rifle or a pistol.

2237 2018-02-19 05:21:38 If you are new, I would absolutely not recommend naked shorting, especially these penny stocks. If you have bad internet connection and lag out during a squeeze, you're future is over! Shorting should only be done after a few years of trading imo
2238 2018-02-19 05:21:34 Should be read as "If people just follow stocks that he mentions without the discipline & method that he follows/recommends, it may land them into trouble". With clients, he's in control but with followers he isn't !!

2317 2018-02-19 04:52:51 Do you mean a bump stock?
Well of course it does and bump stocks were barely legal.

2406 2018-02-19 04:32:13 Bump stocks should be re-classified so that to own one you need a Class 3 license. I think that is acceptable. Class 3 licenses are $$$ & a pain. The mistake the left made was push for a ban, no compromise. Libs always overreach. It's ban, shutdown or shut us up on everything.

2430 2018-02-19 04:26:14 @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity Following NRA/Fox logic that semi-auto "ARs" and/or bump stocks don't kill people; people kill people: Why not repeal 1934 law basically outlawing "Tommy"/machine/fully-automatic guns?  What is the difference?  150 rounds in 2 minutes  vs 4?

2433 2018-02-19 04:23:12 Why would that be their job? Litterally, they advocate for gun rights, gun safety, and wildlife preservation and management. That's it.
They were amongst the 1st to speak out against "bump-stocks" after Las Vegas. They are FINE with keeping guns out of certain people's hands.
2434 2018-02-19 04:22:19 “There’s a Presidents’ Day sale on bump stocks, the device the Las Vegas shooter put on his rifles. Slide Fire Solutions, a bump stocks manufacturer, is offering 10% off with coupon code: MAGA.”
2435 2018-02-19 04:22:17 And p.s. I'm a gun owner and hunter but im also married to a teacher and have a kid in school. NOBODY IS GOING TO TAKE ALL YOUR GUNS! Can we please have stricter BG checks, mental health evals, no assault rifles, no high cap mags and no bump stocks? Would that bother you?!

2464 2018-02-19 04:13:41 Silencers are usually illegal. I’m unsure if it is across the board but I’ve never seen where the average person could buy one. Bump stocks really should not be legal. That stuff is not what any civilian needs. I’m shocked how easy it is to get one.

2479 2018-02-19 04:08:56 Seriously-bump stocks. 1 bump stock used in a crime that was modified is going to change anything?
Magazine limits? Because a shooter is only going to carry 1 -15 round magazine and will be to lazy to carry 2-10 round magazines.
2480 2018-02-19 04:08:47 But they didnt completely ban all automatic weapons which can still be LEGALLY purchased.
Any long gun may be altered to a semi-automatic which means banning auto and semi-autos is moot.
Banning bump stocks is useless bc digi-trigger has made that obsolete..

2482 2018-02-19 04:08:15 I'm saying that since bump stocks are so easy to make and they so easily make semi automatics much more automatic, we need be better at controlling who buys high capacity semi automatic weapons. #nomoremurderedchildren
2483 2018-02-19 04:08:14 Let's just let the school shootings continue, eh? Good plan. Do you see why we are so mad? By opposing ANY gun control (what about bump stocks even?) they have created a volcano of anger. No one should die in school.

2498 2018-02-19 04:02:36 No you can’t. This has to be a rational continuing conversation. We should start by securing schools. Then fix the NICS Database to be as complete as possible. There have been too many ‘gaps’ in info getting to it. And since full-auto aren’t legal (ex pre86), bump-stocks s/b too.
2499 2018-02-19 04:02:25 Sorry guys I'm being crushed with notifications. Judd Appatow retweeted this exchange, so things have really gotten out of hand. But for starters, instant background checks would be a great starting point. No reason for bump stocks to be sold to anyone either.

2511 2018-02-19 04:00:26 The NRA has refused to allow ANY concessions by their people. This has burgeoned into a volcano and it is finally, maybe, blowing! Not even bump stocks! I own guns but this is ridiculous! Smell the coffee. People are pissed! Do you have kids?

2560 2018-02-19 03:52:29 So you ban the AR15 they use a different gun and pretty soon the precedent becomes to ban whatever gun is used. It was bump stocks in the last Vegas shooting . If I’m not mistaken it was rifles handguns and a shotgun used at sandy hook .

2568 2018-02-19 03:51:36 We don’t care who legalized bump stocks. It was a mistake. It’s not a partisan issue to most of us. We’re not “libs”. We’re PARENTS. Clearly.
2569 2018-02-19 03:51:23 It was included in the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban, so we didn’t define it, the gov’t did. What other legal weapons are capable of what happened in Las Vegas? One man, 57 dead, 300+ injured. An AR-15 with large mags and bump stocks is the only one.

2575 2018-02-19 03:50:36 I didnt say anything about wanting to ban guns. Don’t put words in my tweets. Universal background checks and mandatory waiting periods are a start. Elimination of high capacity magazines and bump stocks would be another.

2614 2018-02-19 03:41:50 Congress can’t even ban bumpstocks.  We need a fucking list of how every Congressman votes on bump stocks and assault rifles.  Vote every one out who has No Balls on this issue.
2615 2018-02-19 03:41:29 The problem is the absolutist view from the NRA and the politicians they've bought. If someone can't leave a mental hospital and buy an AR-15 with thousands of rounds of ammo, extended magazines and bump stocks for the mass shooting they plan, it's Constitutional subversion!
2616 2018-02-19 03:41:21 Start by banning all assault weapons. Then ban bump stocks and do stringent background checks. Then start to filter the obviously mentally ill.
2617 2018-02-19 03:41:15 Let’s stop the gun violence.The State needs 2 ban assault weapons including the AR-15, bump-stocks,mega magazines,must be 21 2 own a rifle or pistol and pass extensive background check,mental check and training.We need to start somewhere & KS could take the lead #MomsDemandAction

2622 2018-02-19 03:39:44 Bump stocks are shit. All they do is ruin the accuracy of the weapon.

2626 2018-02-19 03:38:09 And bump stocks/extended magazines just need to go away. Those are designed for battlefields and mass shootings. Again, this is an established pattern. We don't allow machine guns because the potential harm is so highly disproportionate, and we should not allow these either.
2627 2018-02-19 03:37:40 Why cuz not one bus company donated millions of dollars to the Republican Party. Yet NRA and gun lobbyist donate millions and millions and they don't want to lose that money. Pretty sad our kids lives are worth money. NRA stocks go up every shooting so they love it. Sad

2635 2018-02-19 03:36:19 The NRA has done this to themselves (plus taking money from Russia!). They created this volcano! They wouldn't even let their politicians vote against bump stocks after Vegas.  They said let the ATF do it and nothing has been done!!! Let them go down in flames!
2636 2018-02-19 03:35:48 You did nothing after Sandy Hook and other mass shootings.  Will you allow a vote on reasonable gun control legislation? Ban bump stocks? Ban assault weapons? If not...you have blood on your hands. Care more for our children than guns.

2638 2018-02-19 03:35:41 Japanese shares rose Monday helped by a weaker yen and after U.S. equities capped their best week in five years.
Asian equities are building on their best week since September 2016, with stocks in South Korea also gaining, even as markets in Hong Kong and China are closed
2639 2018-02-19 03:35:38 Why am I a hypocrite? I have no problem with legal ownership of guns. I do have a problem with legal ownership of military style weapons and bump stocks that make them automatic.
When did I ever say all gun ownership should be illegal? That's the problem. No one listens.
2640 2018-02-19 03:35:19 Cryptos are still cheap if you don’t look at the top 3.

2654 2018-02-19 03:32:40 Let’s buy stocks
2655 2018-02-19 03:32:38 Would you ban automatic and semi-automatic long guns and hand guns? What about bump stocks? What about high capacity magazines! Personally, I lose respect for someone when I read that they are “pro-gun”; I’m of the belief that guns have no place in the hands of ANY civilians!
2656 2018-02-19 03:32:19 I'm a gun owner. A hunter. A farmer. But most importantly a father and husband to a teacher. These KIDS are mobilizing to ban assault rifles, high cap magazines, bump stocks etc... Take your "paid protesters"  and get back to the #NRA talking points for another line of crap.

2698 2018-02-19 03:25:39 (Respectfully and I don’t own a gun) Had bump stocks been banned, it wouldn’t have prevented this shooting, fair?  So let’s  ban the A-R 15.  When there’s another shooting, what’s next?  My point is maybe our law enforcement needs to up their game.

2800 2018-02-19 03:01:50 Not all their guns, just the ones meant to mass murder. You won’t even ban bump stocks and Kevlar piercing bullets. You’ve got blood on your hands and so does NRA. The majority of their members agree and they still don’t listen.

2802 2018-02-19 03:01:12 "Military grade" is a completely useless and irrelevant descriptor. M16-A2's are semi automatic or 3 round burst. So there is realistically no functional difference. Bump stocks do more than what we give the military. Source - I was in the Army for 11 yrs.
2803 2018-02-19 03:01:10 These kids are changing the debate. Their voices will focus the election on the useless politicians who let this happen & help adults vote them out.

2835 2018-02-19 02:48:56 Hell no...we do not need concealed carry in schools.  We need to buy back ever AK-15 possible, & outlaw the purchase of semi-automatic & automatic weapons, bump stocks and multibullet magazines that fit in them. We need to improve background checks, and make 21 age to buy guns.

2840 2018-02-19 02:47:41 I love how people are arguing about factors that are specific to one of these shootings (FBI and it was Bump Stocks in NV) just so they can ignore the things that ALL of these shootings have in common: guns and mental health

2844 2018-02-19 02:46:24 If you think owning a gun is more important than a kids life that’s fine but just admit it. The nra has rejected any compromise at all. No gun registry, no ban on bump stocks, no semi automatic weapon ban. I’m sorry I reject the status quo that’s failing so badly.

2859 2018-02-19 02:42:13 Trigger cranks are illegal, bump stocks are a gimmick and don’t work well but should be illegal since it’s a modification to an existing semiautomatic weapon that turns it into an automatic weapon does violating federal firearms regulations. It slides on a technicality in the law

2865 2018-02-19 02:40:20 I hope everyone remembers this November that Dean Heller is nothing more than a gun-whore politician and we can do better in Nevada. No guns for the no fly list, spousal abuse, or mentally  challenged folks. No bump stocks, AK-47, armor piercing bullets, and silencers. No Heller!

2887 2018-02-19 02:32:35 he stresses the fact an automatic weapon wasn't used in this  situation but fails to mention the capabilities of a bump stock; i dont know if one was used here but my point is bump stocks should be classed as a modification and attempt to bypass that  law and therefore be banned

2889 2018-02-19 02:31:05 Banning semi-automatics and bump stocks does not infringe on the right to own guns. 1791 guns should be what is allowed after all that was only what our forefathers were aware of.

2894 2018-02-19 02:29:58 Who raised awareness on how bump stocks should have stricter laws after the Vegas shooting? The NRA did. What has congress don't about bump stocks? Nothing. Blame congress not the NRA
2895 2018-02-19 02:29:45 Sure they are. Just vote out the politicians sponsored by the NRA in November. Start working on a Federal ban on bump stocks. Bring back the Clinton ban on assault style weapons. Every journey starts with the first step, don't be pessimistic.

2902 2018-02-19 02:26:59 you say that like there aren't people with just a few hundred dollars worth of stocks on their brokerage accounts or robinhood accounts..didn't know only millionaires traded stocks
2903 2018-02-19 02:26:27 As you know; I live in SC. Honestly; most folks I talk to, old and young, wonder why bump stocks are legal. They also wonder why you only have to be 18 to buy a rifle. Age should be raised. Should be no objection.. you'd think...

2905 2018-02-19 02:26:03 Bump stocks had nothing to do with the this shooting.
2906 2018-02-19 02:25:48 It's true, we must strive for small steps: 1. Universal and effective background checks, 2. no more extended clips or bump stocks, 3. tax on ammo 4 very broadly defined assault weapons ban.... Hard enough to do these small things, much more difficult to do everything at once
2907 2018-02-19 02:25:06 “It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks- those human weeds which threaten the blooming of the finest flowers of American civilization.” Sanger NYT ‘23
2908 2018-02-19 02:23:57 @BretBaier could we have a broader discussion about commonsense measures that all sides could/should agree on (e.g., must be 21 to buy firearms, make bump-stocks illegal)?

2911 2018-02-19 02:22:26 Your rights do not justify the murder of 17 children.   AR-15s, assault rifles, bump stocks and extended magazines should be banned.  Meaningful gun legislation needs to be enacted and our politicians need to get out of the pocket of the NRA.

2919 2018-02-19 02:20:34 I should clarify, I’m the guy who doesn’t like gun shows. And I agree with you.  I like AR-15s. They are fun rifles to shoot and customize.  But I’d never have a need for bump stocks. Certain things need to be addressed.
2920 2018-02-19 02:20:14 As if people don't know your campaign  $$ comes from NRA; you'll do whatever it takes keep them happy and the $$ rolling in. Don't open your mouth. As Trump says, you/he are laughing stocks of America.

2924 2018-02-19 02:16:29 I’d support banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. But I’d never trust politicians, or any humans, enough to get behind full repeal of the 2nd Amendment. Diffuse power is the best power

2926 2018-02-19 02:16:26 1. I prefer to avoid renters building.
2. Why paying overpriced RE to own,  property taxes and realtors? 
3. Will my property bring me more dividend and capital gain comparing to buying stocks?

2927 2018-02-19 02:16:24 Russian bots convinced me to sell my stocks after Trump was elected, causing me to miss out on the greatest bull market in 15 years. Oh no wait, that was Paul Krugman.

2935 2018-02-19 02:13:14 Gun manufacturers prop up the NRA. It helps them sell more guns by sowing division. When they can’t make money with guns they settle for making money from all gun accessories. For example, bump stocks.
2936 2018-02-19 02:12:32 Santelli is a troll. Why have a stock market analyst defend the NRA? 1 reason. To keep the price of gun stocks from going down.

2939 2018-02-19 02:10:21 Don't think Jesus/Moses/MLK, Ghandi etc., would like your Dana hate, Manson/Stalin would. My position-21 Year old limit on AR buys, ban bump stocks, reform 1. FBI followup on critical threat tips and 2. military discharge data, and get states in line with background checks.
2940 2018-02-19 02:10:01 I never said I hated guns, I own them. I just don't think mental illness and AR-15s or Bump stocks mix well.
2941 2018-02-19 02:09:44 "registration is the first step to confiscation"- your grammar needed some help.  Assault rifles, extended magazines and bump stocks should be confiscated.
2942 2018-02-19 02:08:31 Is there anyone against banning bump stocks? I’d love to hear the pro bump stocks take.
2943 2018-02-19 02:07:42 Reinstate the Assault Weapon Ban
No Gun Sales Under age 21
License is needed to buy a car, a license is needed to but all guns
To get a license must pass a gun safety course
5 renewal of license w/test
Mental Health restrictions
No Bump Stocks
just off the top of my head.
2944 2018-02-19 02:07:42 I would support a multi-agency system like this combined with a Gun Violence Restraining Order based on reasonable suspicion (not probable cause - if there’s probable cause then arrest them!)

Plus...restrictions on bump stocks, assault weapons and high capacity clips
2945 2018-02-19 02:07:39 Podesta was Hillary Clinton's campaign manager he also own stocks and a Russian company and him and his brother and manafort were all in on this illegal deal together and that's why they're all going down this has nothing to do with the campaigns

2947 2018-02-19 02:07:02 Go ahead and order your bump stocks now and then check back on this in a week.
2948 2018-02-19 02:07:02 Also no bump stocks
2949 2018-02-19 02:06:58 Still they are killing machines meant to kill as many humans as you can as quickly as you can...do away with them and bump stocks

2951 2018-02-19 02:06:15 We need tighter gun laws-longer waiting periods, mental health check, no gun if a felony, a DV charge, register gun, no private sellers, a limit on type and amount of guns and ammo, no fucking bump stocks...
2952 2018-02-19 02:04:48 Secular inflation is returning. Why? Money printing, economic growth with near full employment, tax cuts, coming infrastructure spending..what will do well? Stocks, Behavioral Assets, real estate? What will do poorly? Long maturity fixed rate bonds, renters, cash sitters

2954 2018-02-19 02:03:42 A bump stock is not military issue. I have no idea why bump stocks are legal. Also, you realize that there are different magazines other than 30 rounds? You realize that there are other semi-auto rifles (and pistols & shotguns for that matter) that are not AR/AK platform?
2955 2018-02-19 02:03:40 I just can't get passed the AR15 and bump stocks fanaticism of pretend little police or military imposters. If you want to carry a gun like that, get trained and become the professional trained to carry such weaponry!

2959 2018-02-19 02:01:07 Anyone who doesn’t support re-instating an assault weapons ban (which was originally enacted under Reagan) and a ban on bump stocks values guns over human life. No question. Those are weapons whose sole purpose is to kill humans. They are weapons of war.

2964 2018-02-19 01:59:19 What about bump stocks?  We must keep up the pressure on the NRA pawns.
2965 2018-02-19 01:58:01 investing in stocks or making a lyric video with windows movie maker in the year 2008? 
2966 2018-02-19 01:57:35 Please check my tweets in the past. I have always said,'Refrain from investing in public sector banks no matter how cheap they become.' I believe it is better to buy stocks 10% to 20% expensive if their direction becomes clear.
2967 2018-02-19 01:56:33 Perhaps it’s more about the length of barrel & “modified” (aka bump stocks) or perhaps it’s defined differently in Cdn law.  I’m not going to pretend to be an expert on the differences between our laws.
2968 2018-02-19 01:56:13 Buy stocks and run away .....
2969 2018-02-19 01:55:50 You know I'm not asking anyone to give up what they paid for, however I'm asking for checks and proper vetting for future sales of certain weapons.

However I'm asking for the immediate ban of any future sales of bump stocks.
2970 2018-02-19 01:54:52 We could do what makes the most sense and ban assault rifles, bump stocks and extended magazines.  You know... Common Sense gun laws.

2981 2018-02-19 01:47:00 Not true. Florida law requires court intervention to take away legally acquired guns. You and other NRA flunkies have endless of gun proliferation policies.  Bump stocks? No action. Mental illness? Make it easier to obtain guns. Response to mass killings  We will vote you out
2982 2018-02-19 01:45:47 There's nothing mystical about large magazines affecting the rate of fire either which is the vice under discussion. More bullets kill more 'past the first few'.. i.e. you can get off 3 x as many in a mag that has a capacity of 15 as one that has 5 with no change
oh bump-stocks??

2988 2018-02-19 01:42:48 That's what they fucking said about bump stocks after Las Vegas. Then nothing happened.
2989 2018-02-19 01:42:40 I read, and write in several languages, understand stocks, bonds and     derivatives. Make a decent bottle of wine, and understand how to discern.
2990 2018-02-19 01:42:18 No argument that bump stocks should be prohibited.
2991 2018-02-19 01:41:59 Good q, about data comparability. That said, this new event is finding agents to create new news. Absent new news, this is why republicans obfuscate - it goes away. Remember the reasonable republicans that were going to deal with bump stocks after Vegas? Chirp chirp.....

2995 2018-02-19 01:38:20 Im not sure why ppl always go 2 the "all or nothing" pov when discussing firearm restrictions. I can see that sadly @MarkRPellegrino has also drank that kool aid. Background checks & Taking ak47's or bump stocks away from civilians IS NOT taking away 2nd amendment rights! ...
2996 2018-02-19 01:37:13 The #NRA should be responsible for every medical bill, as should @marcorubio who took blood money from the NRA. Any politician who profits through stocks, or accepts donations, aka sells their votes, including Trump, is responsible for lax laws. Therefore they should pay bills.
2997 2018-02-19 01:37:11 What does any of that have to do with Japanese equities falling? Perhaps you're saying weak currency=strong stocks? Not in the 1970s.
2998 2018-02-19 01:36:49 Really? I would like to see him kill 17 people in 6 minutes with a knife. I don't understand what you don't understand. The only purpose for these guns and bump stocks are to kill as many people as possible in as short a time as possible.
2999 2018-02-19 01:35:37 I'm just saying knowledge is power. And if someone is lying to you, it's never good. 'Assault weapon' bans in the past banned features like adjustable stocks or barrel shrouds that mean nothing for deadliness, but politicians knew they make the gun look scary.
3000 2018-02-19 01:35:37 reading comprehension. There is no waiting period to get an AR15 in Florida. I'm sure he had the gun for more than a day. And I mention silencers because if they are used during a mass shooting, even more damage could be done. So ban them BEFORE it happens. Bump stocks were used
3001 2018-02-19 01:34:25 The only place you are able to shoot automatic weapons is in Nevada I believe (just shoot not own). Automatic weapons are not available to citizens. Bump stocks are more accessible and yes I would agree it technically makes it automatic but no shooting has had one involved.
3002 2018-02-19 01:34:06 @SpeakerRyan Please bring to the floor the bills banning bump stocks and increasing the strength of background checks before gun purchases. It’s the least you can do. The least. #ParklandStrong #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
3003 2018-02-19 01:32:36 Same barrels, same bolts, same receivers, same stocks, only difference is the trigger sear. In some cases the civilian-market parts are better quality than "military grade."
3004 2018-02-19 01:32:10 So we don't even try? We don't reinstate the assault weapons ban that was in place for ten years, or outlaw bump stocks or high capacity magazines? We don't require universal background checks or licensing or insurance against damage to people or property? Nope, just more guns!

3006 2018-02-19 01:30:59 Yeah...seems like you should be focusing on a bit more than bump stocks.   We all know about the Overton Window...and I'm sure you do as well, but lack political will to press for more as a starting negotiating position.

3009 2018-02-19 01:28:54 In Florida, a person can get an AR15 on the same day with a simple background check. That process got 17 people killed. People don't need silencers and bump stocks were used to shoot 500 people. ban them. I don't care if they're unwilling, no civilian should have an AR.

3011 2018-02-19 01:26:08 Must be passed: Improve K-12 school security. Educate teachers, parents, MD's. Improve mental health svcs. Ban sale of guns/rifles to anyone <21. Ban unlicensed gun dealers. Have a 2-day min. waiting period. Improve background checks. Ban bump stocks. Fire Obama holdovers at FBI.
3012 2018-02-19 01:25:46 Interesting response but, having two stocks does not mean your portfolio is diversified. They could both belong to the same sector & have similar levels of risk. 

For the question, #behaviouralfinance we will advise that you sell stock B to avoid the "disposition effect".
3013 2018-02-19 01:25:35 Thanks for answering it, I learned something!

It really does boggle the mind, though, how this could possibly be considered a 'pistol'. 

I know there are actual pistols that have modular stocks, etc. but the overall form of the thing still resembles a pistol with bits added on.
3014 2018-02-19 01:24:57 Must be passed: Improve K-12 school security. Educate teachers, parents, MD's. Improve mental health svcs. Ban sale of guns/rifles to anyone <21. Ban unlicensed gun dealers.

3015 2018-02-19 01:24:50 Please use your NRA membership to ask them to support assault weapons ban, closing the gun show loophole, stronger background checks, and bans on high capacity magazines and bump stocks.  We would appreciate it!!
3016 2018-02-19 01:22:38 There may be a way to modify and AR-15 to do full auto or close to it, but not legally, except for bump stocks which are not yet banned and trigger crank type mechanisms. Not sure of the status of those.
3017 2018-02-19 01:22:34 Also bump stocks...
3018 2018-02-19 01:21:38 And while you are there look at who in Congress is highly invested in arms and defense stocks.  Big heavy weight democrats top the list.
3019 2018-02-19 01:21:32 you're probably thinking of the term "assault weapon" which dates back to the 80s. the definition is vague and its very much a political idea but it refers to weapons with various features such as large magazines and folding stocks, etc.
3020 2018-02-19 01:21:16 4 am , then I popped . 
Up for the opportunities till ya’ll decided to kick rocks .
coming downhill on all stocks , boy stop . 
And dig deep through them sheets to reap what you see in these crops.
3021 2018-02-19 01:21:02 @SethMacFarlane Those who invest in gun manufacturing stocks on the stock market should be shamed into selling their stock as they have blood on their hands too. Gun stocks go up in value after mass murders so shame investors to sell their gun stocks so value plummets.
3022 2018-02-19 01:20:56 My guess is they will produce a bill to ban AR and bump stocks but sneak in something about abortions or ACA or some other BS, then cry foul when Dems won’t pass it! Classic gop move
3023 2018-02-19 01:20:30 Those mentally adjudicated are still prohibited from buying a gun.
Bump stocks aren't banned because you don't need them to bump fire, it also violates the Takings Clause and due process.
3024 2018-02-19 01:20:24 Look for honey flavoured ones or lemon flavoured. You might have to look for a store that stocks natural products but I swear by Comvita Lemon and Honey lozenges
3025 2018-02-19 01:19:43 It sounds more like a prison than an airport to me. stricter background checks, longer waiting periods, bans on silencers and bump stocks, ban ARs (do buybacks) and stop pretending the average person needs a weapon that has the ability to injure 500 people.
3026 2018-02-19 01:19:35 Most likely a song and dance from Horgan to simply harm #KinderMorgan thru delay tactics to drive their stocks down. Politicians are great at the smoke and mirror tricks once in office.
3027 2018-02-19 01:19:35 I think most would agree civilians should be age 21 to purchase ANY firearm. (I get the military argument). Make owning, manufacturing, selling or possessing bump stocks illegal. Not a total fix but may help some.

3029 2018-02-19 01:16:56 If you can predict the future you should be buying stocks and lotto tickets. All we know if what’s the situation now. Texas and UCLA could just as easily get hot and be 8/9 seeds.
3030 2018-02-19 01:16:40 Highlights why you have to heavily restrict the semi auto mechanism not components that can be switched out like barrels stocks or magazines. Here in australia only professional hunters and firearm collectors can have semi auto longarms.
3031 2018-02-19 01:14:57 that has several dozen facets. The rhetoric is getting in the way of rational discussion and both sides torpedo any chance of solving anything. ARs are Big And Scary, but when the shooter shouldn't have *any * firearms, it doesn't matter. Bump stocks are unnecessary on
3032 2018-02-19 01:14:08 We're all better unarmed because facts say so. Besides, it's not all that bad. You can still have guns, just not high capacity ones, no bump stocks, lower fire rate weapons, and you have to pass a background check, mental health check and wait period.
3033 2018-02-19 01:13:19 It’s no loophole the sale of bump stocks was approved under the Obama administration. Next had nothing to do with this situation

3037 2018-02-19 01:11:36 Good question. Maybe you can sell and buy dividend paying stocks or REITs. It really depends on your own situation and where you live
3038 2018-02-19 01:10:40 Show me where I suggested to give them a pass? And this administration just made it easier for people with mental problems to get guns. Great idea right? Did we get a ban on bump stocks yet? Stricter backgrounds checks? No... It’s almost like sales matter more than safety.
3039 2018-02-19 01:10:40 Congress, here’s a plan for  legislation  1) make a national minimum age to purchase a gun or gun accessories 21 years old. 2) Ban and eliminate bump stocks. 3) stop selling military-style rifles. Nobody loses their guns. Lives are spared. #GunReformNow
3040 2018-02-19 01:09:17 Republicans: “If You Ban the AR-15, the Bad Guys Will Just Find another Way.” My Opinion-This is a Very Dumb Statement b/c the AR-15 is Being Used More than Ever to Commit Mass Murder-Abolish it or Make it Harder to Buy-Age Limit, 120 Day Wait Period, Ban Bump Stocks
3041 2018-02-19 01:08:49 So you are for infringement on the right to bear arms. Well at least you believe we should have bump stocks right?
3042 2018-02-19 01:08:29 Causes incidents like this to happen while people clain nothing can be done. Muder will still happen yes but with a much lower casualty rate if we make it harder to own guns or outlaw things like bump stocks. Even the 1st amendment has restrictions why not the second.
3043 2018-02-19 01:06:58 that’s not HOW it should work but it’s pretty much how it is. it’s like stocks. you gotta take the gamble—and they place their bets where the majority are. they just didn’t get the best of results

3045 2018-02-19 01:06:10 Despite the assurances from the Merchants of Death (NRA) and gun fetishists that banning bump stocks wouldn’t help keep us safer, the Washington State banned them anyway. Winning elections matters. #NeverAgain

3047 2018-02-19 01:05:37 Well for one, I am tickled pink to finally see my stocks making money. I consider earning up to $500 per month on my stocks great news! And while Trump may have had affairs (not all r proven) at least he didn't do while in the White House! Being ex-military, what Hillary has

3049 2018-02-19 01:04:43 Allow the CDC to study gun violence. Require licensing and registration for gun ownership nation wide. Ban bump stocks. And seriously consider banning semi-automatic weapons completely like fully-auto guns.
3050 2018-02-19 01:04:29 My wife, who works in finance, told me it's not likely I can get my 401k money out of weapons stocks. But damnit I'm going to try. If enough negative pressure comes we can get them all out of business.

3052 2018-02-19 01:01:59 Way more people die from handguns then rifles of any kind. The news just highlights the ones with the big scary rifles. You know the ones with out wooden stocks.
3053 2018-02-19 01:01:50 Really! No one needs a gun like that. Are you telling me you actually hunt with an AR-15? B.S. I do believe in the 2ND Amendment. But we don't need this sort of gun bumb stocks out.there killing innocent people
 Blame it on Mental Health all you want but that is also BS.
3054 2018-02-19 01:00:27 are bump stocks banned? Are these common since things in place? If put in place, would they stand up to judicial review? I'm not saying to get rid of guns, I's saying to get rid of the free pass for guns that is the second amendment.
3055 2018-02-19 01:00:12 It's cute how you think you know what I'm thinking, except for the part where you don't.

What I want is:
Required reg/lic/ins.
A ban on high capacity magazines and bump-stocks.
A ban on semi-auto rifles, not handguns.
And req'd background checks/waiting period on all sales.
3056 2018-02-19 01:00:10 Davido really pulled out all the stocks at his London show loooooooooooooool
3057 2018-02-19 00:59:55 Maybe your god should have stopped man from creating firearms, if he is so high and mighty?  throw a tablet down like moses that says "no pistol grips and collapsable stocks" 
3058 2018-02-19 00:59:29 We must get rid of bump stocks. Bump stocks are the key to all the evil. No bump stocks = gun won’t murder. Don’t let Clif believe anything else Jeff! I don’t remember the 2nd amendment saying we had to have bump stocks, do you???
3059 2018-02-19 00:59:17 => Well . . . OK, but it should be permissible to take a screen shot of the Trolls BS and use it for a little public humiliation (aka the public stocks).
3060 2018-02-19 00:59:10 Many do, yes. They also get to have access to stock info that we don't. One person Trump nominated, was pushing contracts with the government from a company he himself owned stocks in, when in senate. 
But not all.
3061 2018-02-19 00:58:29 But there are some things gun owners can agree on some have already given there AR15s to@police to be destroyed knowing that they don’t need one and the other fire arms is all that they need to defend themselves. Most of the people I know already agree to ban bump stocks.
3062 2018-02-19 00:56:37 except these bump stocks loophole that law, and allow the rifle to fire as a automatic would.
3063 2018-02-19 00:56:20 The other thing I struggle with is the bump stocks. I may not understand them right, but I think they allow you to make firing more automatic? If so, why does anyone need that?

3067 2018-02-19 00:53:39 Actually, even Scalia ruled there can be restrictions on guns. So by asking for semi-automatic bans, assault riffles, better background checks, no boom stocks. large magazines etc. the kids are entirely in keeping with the constitution.
3068 2018-02-19 00:53:34 No Stocks & Treasuries did not have their big declines as yet. There's more to come. Corporates trail these markets!!
3069 2018-02-19 00:53:33 European stocks rose on Friday to post the largest weekly gain in more than a year.
3070 2018-02-19 00:53:08 US stocks mostly rose on Friday ahead of a President’s Day holiday weekend, although indices retreated from highs late in the session after 13 Russian nationals were charged with interfering in the 2016 presidential election.
3071 2018-02-19 00:52:46 Bump stocks and 30 round clips. Technically a semi-automatic but a rather deadly one at that.
3072 2018-02-19 00:51:30 Stock Market is closed tomorrow... what to do?  #stocks #investing
3073 2018-02-19 00:51:03 Fed printing to support 3-4T of deficits merely props up existing real economy--it doesn't make stocks exponentially more valuable or increase value relative to pre-crash, pre-QE conditions. If stocks crash 80%, I want to own them too but not because of QE--because they're cheap.
3074 2018-02-19 00:50:28 I would start with making assault rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks (war weaponry) illegal. Anyone that owns said weapons have X amount of time to turn into Govt buy back program or criminal possession afterward.
3075 2018-02-19 00:49:28 There was massive USD devaluation in the '70s, and stocks went sideways in nominal terms, down big in real terms. Stocks are a loser from current valuations regardless of policy response or macro.

3077 2018-02-19 00:48:38 2/ I would start with:

Increasing age to buy guns to 25...when the brain is fully developed.

Banning bump stocks and silencers.

If we can’t eliminate AR’s, then let’s at least require a much higher approval threshold to buy one and have ongoing monitoring.

#ImWithTheKids
3078 2018-02-19 00:48:21 You're assuming investors would balk at absorbing massive new T-bond supply even in a deflationary environment where low nominal yields=high real yields. Wrong. Also, you talk in the abstract about "wanting to own stocks" based on macro policy without reference to valuation.
3079 2018-02-19 00:47:42 Sadly true.
But I can make some noise.
And maybe getting rid of large-capacity magazines and bump stocks might happen.
Ask for more than you want and you might get more than you had.
3080 2018-02-19 00:47:28 I'm not going to argue that. I'm just offering and slightly different point of view. Bump stocks should be illegal. No questions. 30 round mags probably need a background check like buying a pistol.
3081 2018-02-19 00:46:52 5 stocks > 4 stocks
3082 2018-02-19 00:44:45 In FL the legal age for ownership in 18. In FL there is no specialized permit for assault rifles, there should be. Weapons such as the AR-15 and accessories such as bump stocks and expanded magazines should be illegal to own. PPH has nothing to do with gun laws.
3083 2018-02-19 00:44:03 @JimCarrey jim carey, delete your own facebook, sell you own stocks, sell your guns, who gives a fuck, when its coming from such an asshole, that made some ones life so miserable, you stand for nothing, and beg for forgiveness, thats all you do now.
3084 2018-02-19 00:43:48 just because you're an attorney doesn't mean you have a fundamental grasp on the reality that an "assault weapons" ban is probably the most insane law ever conceived.  Pistol grips and adjustable stocks are the hill liberals choose to die on, and they're confused why they lose
3085 2018-02-19 00:43:19 trying to close ripple trades when the downslide occurred only to be forced to sit and watch myself lose 15k..same happened with few stocks too, they’re corrupt. I took screenshots of large amounts exceeding 100k being put into my account then withdrawn. I’ve never seen 100k ever
3086 2018-02-19 00:42:17 You working on bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles yet?

3089 2018-02-19 00:41:51 I disagree with this. She can camp better than sonic with customs and her problem with not being able to close stocks out against diddy is completely gone. Theyd probs be her worst mus and be even or 45 55 at worst.
3090 2018-02-19 00:41:21 Yes, but you were still better off holding stocks than USD. Arguably, shares of Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (Mercedes) lost value in real terms during Weimar republic hyperinflation period, but they did a lot better than the Mark.
3091 2018-02-19 00:41:04 Ah... But about that, those who actually know the market question what if any effect de-regulation has had (sans bank stocks).
3092 2018-02-19 00:40:48 We’re are you finding some of this stuff, you can not buy any automatic conversion kits,armor piercing bullits. Bump stocks yes. Nobody even Hurd of them until Vegas shooting.
3093 2018-02-19 00:39:59 Okay.. then let’s get real.. I got several ideas.. fixed stocks, regulate the filth Hollywood pumps into our kids, reopen mental hospitals that Governor Jerry Brown and the ACLU closed in the late 1970s.
3094 2018-02-19 00:38:52 You don't need an AR-15 or bump stocks to hunt deer. You could still have your stupid father-son bonding moment with background checks and wait times. Plus, I don't really care. Bond a more useful way. My dad taught me about computers. Get a better hobby than shooting animals.
3095 2018-02-19 00:38:48 And many more americans owns mutual funds with guns stocks in their 401k and do't even know about it. Follow the money.

3098 2018-02-19 00:35:22 Do some research and you’ll learn that bump stocks do not convert a semiautomatic gun into a full automatic. Here is another example of politicians playing politics for their agenda. Tell me how banning items really works? War on drugs?

3101 2018-02-19 00:34:42 The AR-15 - the weapon of choice in mass shootings - can easily be classified as an assault weapon (a tough thing to define, I'll admit). 

Typically a semiauto rifle, detachable magazines, military options like pistol grips, flash suppressors, folding stocks. High capacity mags.
3102 2018-02-19 00:33:39 My stance on the current debates on assault rifles and bump stocks:

Ban bump stocks - we don't need automatic firing weaponry as citizens.

I'm keeping my fucking assault rifle though.
3103 2018-02-19 00:33:34 Please do everything you can to be a leader in the banning of assault weapons, bump stocks, etc. whose elimination would in no way hurt the sportsman or even someone wanting to protect his or her own home.  This is common sense & WE NEED LEADERSHIP FROM REASONABLE PEOPLE LIKE U!

Thank you for proving my point 

Plus bump stocks are not illegal in most states like saw off shot guns are.

3108 2018-02-19 00:28:22 Very sad you missed the many signals that white males with AR-15s and bump stocks are the biggest terrorist threat to Americans. If the bodies of murdered children don't move you to action then you have no soul. Fix it anyway. BAN SEMI-AUTOMATICS, and regulate gun ownership.
3109 2018-02-19 00:27:56 I agree. When we get a sustained move lower in stocks and a sustained move higher in rates a lot of people are gonna get burned.
3110 2018-02-19 00:27:52 Why are bump stocks still legal? 
That should be easy low hanging fruit.
3111 2018-02-19 00:27:43 Can confirm, this is what happened to me on FD last time I played a MK. Lost both stocks starting from a dash attack around the 20% range. I lost neutral 3 times and that was the game. 
3112 2018-02-19 00:27:25 Whale Wisdom is a good site for the latest holding disclosures if you’re curious.  Berkshire has about $191 billion total in stocks / equities.
3113 2018-02-19 00:26:51 Who could oppose sensible reform of semi automatic weapons with high capacity magazines, bump stocks and Online purchases?
3114 2018-02-19 00:25:52 Yes, as they should have. Instead of banning the stocks ,the left went on to define it as the parts of that class, which includes all kinds of shit that gun owners care for. They poisoned the bill by including things like trigger improvements, which is absurd.
3115 2018-02-19 00:25:50 When you can’t even get AR-15s or bump stocks banned it’s hard to be optimistic

3119 2018-02-19 00:24:50 Shit I might have to scoop 2-3 ARs and cpl slidefire stocks all this gun control bullshit
3120 2018-02-19 00:23:27 No, but go ahead, I'm old school and like my guns blued with wooden stocks. My hunting rifles make "assault rifles" look like pop-guns, anyway.
3121 2018-02-19 00:22:41 We don't need another agency. We need sensible gun laws, like no silencers, no bump stocks, a nat'l registry. Mandatory firearm training for gun owners or to buy a gun. This is common sense.
3122 2018-02-19 00:22:31 What Democrat controlled state has made big leaps in Gun Control?  How many have banned Bump Stocks since Vegas?
3123 2018-02-19 00:22:25 Duped by good jobs,bonuses, record breaking stocks illegals not flooding through our borders. Ok I'll take it if that's being duped I want more!! I know you hate the fact that Trump has done more for TRUE Americans in one year then Ovomit could in 8 but that was never O's mission
3124 2018-02-19 00:21:44 I think the biggest problem in US is the NRA.  They need to be abolished along with all automatic weapons, all military or military style weapons, bump stocks, etc.
3125 2018-02-19 00:21:15 ETF representing largely two themes: one is low cost bracket of stocks, the other is passive investment. 
I think the question was about passive investment, in terms of market impact.
3126 2018-02-19 00:21:04 Deranged people will find a way to kill even without guns. But the casualty rate will be far much lower. If assault rifles and bump stocks were outlawed, those tragedies wouldn't have happened. Your right to own a pistol and a shotgun would still remain. Nobody needs an AR-15.
3127 2018-02-19 00:20:56 True but why if he detests BTC so much and thinks it will ultimately fail would you hold onto that? No one in stocks would hold onto something they thought was going to fail?

The President and Paul Ryan have NO INTENTIONS to bring forth bills to ban semi automatics, bump stocks, reverse what Obama put in place with mentally ill being banned, stronger restrictions on background checks...none of it, UNLESS WE put pressure on them to do so
3132 2018-02-19 00:18:58 How many more children?

How many dollars accepted by Congress to stop any solution?

3133 2018-02-19 00:18:34 Blaming the FBI for this shooting is disgusting. The kid had a legally owned weapon and hadn't yet broken the law. What were they supposed to do? Put the request for investigation on the pile with thousands of other threats because AR-15s and bump stocks are legal, that's what
3134 2018-02-19 00:18:25 Definition AR needs to broaden. Mags limit capacity. 11-100 rnds illegal xcept class 3 (or new desig), bump stocks illegal. Existing ARs must be registered w/ pic ID c3. No GF. Central DB. Not reg > illegal. MI, rec of violence> no guns/rifles. AR ammunition reg to weapon & ID.
3135 2018-02-19 00:18:18 I never said that, straw man. I said we fail to pass common sense gun laws, such as comprehensive background checks, not allowing mentally ill people or people on the terrorist watch list to buy guns, closing loop holes, banning bump stocks, etc.
3136 2018-02-19 00:17:28 TBH, while I heard a lot on jobs and water during the campaign, the loudest issue I hear every day is housing. Huge shortage stocks left behind from last govt. Some good initiatives in job creation but need infrastructure to support (houses, roads etc). Will be my focus this year
3137 2018-02-19 00:17:14 David's sheik is hella sick, he did the old westballz to me where he takes half his stocks and also mine lmao
3138 2018-02-19 00:15:45 This shows a lack of Constitutional understanding. A logical approach would be the GVRO type restrictions on individuals (each state adjusting as needed) while banning & making it harder to purchase parts/add ons which turn weapons automatic or increase firing rates (bump stocks)
3139 2018-02-19 00:15:30 First off Bernie, those "bump stocks" were never proven to be used. Secondly you are not listening to the American people. We will not hand over our guns b/c  you government people say we should, that is a dictatorship. The R's are listening, it is you D's that refuse to listen.

3147 2018-02-19 00:11:40 A study of IRS tax receipts data suggests that if "the stock market is undergoing the worst bear mkt in post WWII era" the US govt will quickly nominal default on those T-bonds unless the Fed prints what could easily be $3-4T annual deficits...in which case I want to own stocks.

3149 2018-02-19 00:11:02 I support the ORIGINAL Feinstein assault weapons ban which was more stringent than the 1994 negotiated ban. Bump stocks shouldn’t be allowed, either.
3150 2018-02-19 00:09:26 Operation is different, straight stocks vs pistol grips and removable stocks, rail systems... those ergonomic clothes are what make the ar15 more useful.

FWIW, I don’t think ARs need to be outlawed. Just being honest.
3151 2018-02-19 00:08:55 BS. The vast majority of Americans want changes- including stricter background checks and a ban on Bump Stocks . . .
3152 2018-02-19 00:07:07 Amen, and catching that reversal low in stocks/gold and top in bonds will be the trade of the century 
3153 2018-02-19 00:06:38 Do you support re-instating the assault weapons ban and banning bump stocks?
3154 2018-02-19 00:06:28 Sarah Westwood you're an idiot bump stocks don't make AR-15 more powerful they make them less effective not very accurate it's not the gun that does The Killing it's the person behind it dumbass

3156 2018-02-19 00:05:57 Not always been his greatest fan but havd to say ....  recently i have been well impressed 
3157 2018-02-19 00:05:09 Need to redo what is considered a rifle. Stocks & grips don't increase range. Should be based of cal. & barrel length. Not accessories.
3158 2018-02-19 00:04:24 @sarahcwestwood just so people know how things really work, and we deserve the truth, bump stocks do not make any gun more powerful. They allow you to fire a gun faster. When you say things that aren't true it doesn't make you look smart. People deserve the truth from the news.
3159 2018-02-19 00:04:00 How do you figure they're enjoying the tax cuts?  90% have not filed 2017 1040s. Fortune 500 corporations benefit: quarterly taxes are reduced.  Owners of publicly traded stock have benefited from increased dividends yet only 6% of America invest in stocks. #TaxReform #FakeNews

3161 2018-02-19 00:02:03 Also......some cars are too  dangerous and are outlawed on public roads... formula 1 race cars for example. Car bans are OK but people still have cars. Assault weapons should be banned along with bump stocks. #neveragain
