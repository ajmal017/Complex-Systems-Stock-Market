13 2019-02-05 23:53:17 Wow you two are still going at it. I follow you both by the way. Buybacks are more tax efficient. Dividends tend to be better in practice since management teams are dumb and buy their stocks when they are overpriced. Both make sense sometimes. We good here?

17 2019-02-05 23:50:27 This is why I think selling out 100% and then buying back in is potentially risky.  If you are whipsawed in and out a lot you lose lots of the market's return.  I think a better approach is to be in defensive stocks if you are worried about losses.

50 2019-02-05 23:39:02 Well context is king right? When the 2nd amendment was written, bump stocks weren't a thing.  Since we are sticking to things from a bygone era why don't gun nuts stick to muskets? What is the point of owning an assault riffle or the like in a civilian world?

61 2019-02-05 23:32:52 I tried shorting it this morning but my current broker @IBKR has no shares available.  This happens with them all the time with low float and low price stocks.  I'm considering switching to another broker with better shorts availability.
62 2019-02-05 23:31:56 Hi Claude, thanks to you, Matt & Andrew for the insightful podcast. Grateful if you could cover how to short ASX stocks today. IMO, Cochlear is priced ‘to infinity and beyond’ and I think the risks are tilted to the downside. I’d like to exploit the ‘mispricing’ if possible. Ta

How can traders in other markets such as FX can work around this? 
As I understand it in FX the DOM is not reliable like in stocks or futures. Is there a way to use this methods there or we need to adapt to different methods for those markets?
69 2019-02-05 23:26:28 I am very confident that you will have the chance to do it.  I have a few stocks that I continue to resist the temptation to sell. I just hold my nose and hang on to my $AMZN. I might sell if it ever gets back to 2000 though.

86 2019-02-05 23:16:24 You’re rhetoric doesn’t align with the facts. You ignore the decrease in poverty rates. You ignore that the average poor in this country lives better than the average European. And investing in stocks provides business with capital to increase their business.

94 2019-02-05 23:09:55 Stocks is just rich people investing into other rich people. 
Invest into their own business is not actually helping their workers. Because their workers could still very well be below the poverity line. Businesses will try their best to pay people less and less to make more.

103 2019-02-05 23:03:20 They invest by putting it into stocks, reinvesting into their business to grow them, and into buying things. You completely ignored how the government would do a better job then that. But the answer is they can’t.

112 2019-02-05 22:59:36 Shorter games, just like shorter sets, make it more likely for the worse player to win. It's why we play 3 stocks and not 1 stock. Or best of 3/5 instead of best of one

119 2019-02-05 22:57:27 In fairness, it increases the wealth of everyone with an IRA or 401 plan too (assuming they are not 100% bonds, etc).  All with stocks.

Share buybacks are not the problem, get behind the wealth/high income tax boost that the public is behind, better solution to unchecked greed.

147 2019-02-05 22:42:26 Currently you can't short mainland Chinese listed stocks. You can short Chinese stocks listed in Hong kong.However the juicy ones are US listed, as stocks can be so inflated as it's a mechanism for ¥$.Have a look at China Forrest or China Media Express as good short examples.
148 2019-02-05 22:41:42 Hey Chuck and Bernie, I'd like to know what stocks you own that you worry about the workers and not worry if you're making money.  That's right you guys don't have to invest in American companies, your making your from the backs of ALL the tax payers!

175 2019-02-05 22:32:11 Why? It’s criminal behaviour and should be punishable by twenty eight weeks in the stocks.
176 2019-02-05 22:31:10 All these arguments have been digested already and you have secular growth stocks out-performing (eg. my holdings like $ANSS $ZEN $ZS, etc..) and bubble tech underperform ($FANG). This is pretty much what I was shooting for in the base case.
177 2019-02-05 22:30:49 I was REALLY drunk last year and bought 2 stocks of Microsoft for $104 on the @RobinhoodApp, Sold them today for $208.. not bad for something I completely forgot about

245 2019-02-05 21:47:43 Because that's what stocks do for any number of reasons. Sometimes it has nothing to do with the company. Who cares what the reason is if the company sees value in their stock and they see it as a good investment vs another or as part of a range of investments they make?
246 2019-02-05 21:47:29 Bernie- Some Trivia for ya ! Which POTUS outlawed Bump-Stocks ?
247 2019-02-05 21:46:39 Your overall point is sound.  Waiting to invest in a dip is a poor strategy.  So happy to accept that.  A logical exception would be when stocks are highly valued against earnings that are at a cyclical peak i.e. 2000.  Such circumstances are pretty rare though.
248 2019-02-05 21:46:30 The only @POTUS that outlawed bump stocks??? What are you going on about?
249 2019-02-05 21:46:27 No, not a good idea. Keep the govt out of the businesses and their stocks before they bankrupt them also.

251 2019-02-05 21:45:35 ¿El descontento de quiénes? ¿De cuáles venezolanos? ¿Y la retención de stocks en almacenes? ¿Y el boicot constante a un gobierno legítimo? La cuestión no es que te tenga que gustar Maduro. Es respetar la soberanía de un pais democrático. Sí,  democrático. Ya está bien!
252 2019-02-05 21:45:16 I don’t care what my dad says, buying and selling stocks is just bougie gambling

258 2019-02-05 21:42:23 The usual lingo about "melt up" , short squeeze et al. Yet..stocks are coming back. New high chatter will start before the end of the week.

Like I've been saying... Gaming stocks have a bad future outlook in the next 2 years. They will have nothing much new to offer, and we are in the dead zone between generations
263 2019-02-05 21:39:40 @Apple is buying @comcast @cnbc  The @apple channel but don't go all in yet.  Slow your roll when playing stocks.
264 2019-02-05 21:39:27 Additionally, those who earn a wage are also investors in most cases, either through retirement or personal savings and investment plans. More than half of all Americans own stocks (according to Gallup, 2017).
265 2019-02-05 21:38:47 Typical hallway conversation with @richsullivan and @OtisOshow about what stocks to buy. Nothing to see here folks!
266 2019-02-05 21:38:34 Tech stocks will rally on this tomorrow...lol
267 2019-02-05 21:38:32 Thank you! Yes, geopolitics certainly make things more complicated. I guess you expect your Trilemma to hold? (After all, it does bring all the boys to the yard... ) But maybe stocks up, dollar up and rates going south is also a possibility?
268 2019-02-05 21:38:20 With Brexit or not to Brexit looming is continued investment in stocks and shares ISA’s advisable?
269 2019-02-05 21:38:06 Because stocks are driven by supply and demand in the market and sentiment for the stock as an investment, business performance, etc. etc.  Buybacks aren't the only factor at work.  You're essentially asking the finance version of "why is there winter if climate change exists?"

273 2019-02-05 21:36:44 Again though, sure in the short term it helps stockholders I get that. But stocks were meant as a way for companies to raise capital to expand their company, now it's reversed and companies are simply ways to increase the value of stocks. Which is a recipe for disaster.
274 2019-02-05 21:36:34 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $EL, $LEG, $RL, $EA, and $ABMD.

292 2019-02-05 21:31:19 Yes. Quite a few stocks like this. Have to buy/sell at a premium/discount but the fundamentals have been decent and retail people may be able to take a position.

339 2019-02-05 21:12:59 Yes, but a marginal tax rate affects more than "financial markets". It affects individuals, families, and communities way beyond stocks and bonds. You are making the common mistake of confusing "the market" (measured in GDP) with individual financial lives.

354 2019-02-05 21:08:58 Stock ownership before 2008 was 62 percent, Gallup found. Even after recent inflows, only 54 percent of Americans are invested now. More adults in the United States own homes than stocks. 

Chicago Tribune: Aug 3, 2017
355 2019-02-05 21:07:52 There is a positive bias towards people holding stocks. With a relative good earnings season, investors on the sidelines are chasing the momentum trying to get into the market.

373 2019-02-05 21:01:04 Millions of Americans are invested in stocks. 54% per last article I can find on the subject. 401Ks are not the only investing vehicle. IRAs, pensions, mutual funds.

379 2019-02-05 20:58:43 Nonsense. Jobs up, wages up, stocks up, unemployment down, public assistance down, power returning to the states, etc. The only ones making our union weak are the biased media and chronic resisters.
380 2019-02-05 20:58:25 The stocks would be preferable. And maybe strip their obscene pay packets back to under $500,000 might be a start
381 2019-02-05 20:57:14 That's fair enough.  I'm pretty concentrated too.  I'm just saying that it might be good not be wise to exclude these ugly stocks w/o activist involvement. Sometimes I feel like I would be performing a lot better just buying the bucket though.

387 2019-02-05 20:56:22 These pet rock stocks are behaving a little too well into the close.  WTF is going on here?  Real underlying bids out there by generalist money hedging their bets?  I for one refuse to believe that.
388 2019-02-05 20:56:14 Yesterday I redeemed my only SIP to invest in stocks
389 2019-02-05 20:56:08 see what we are dealing with here? VCDL and NRA represent extreme views. A majority of Virginians would like to see background checks, ERPO pass and bump stocks banned.I watched LEOs testify for these bills that make their job easier, and thx to GOP, still were killed @MomsDemand
390 2019-02-05 20:55:05 Get multiple streams of income.
Fix your credit, bad credit means you pay more in interest over time. Learn about investing. Do some of them all, stocks, options, forex, index funds, more imortant to start. Save enough money to cover bills for 3-6 months. Invest all the rest.

405 2019-02-05 20:49:34 International stocks not Nigerian companies stocks.
406 2019-02-05 20:49:02 it depends on one's strategy. If you are buying a lot of stocks you are right. I run a concentrated portfolio though. 

So, I have to go case by case.

410 2019-02-05 20:47:46 Wow, 80 is a lot. My thinking today was that if I want to put more of my cash to work I couldn't do much better than adding to my holding of #SDI rather than increasing the number of stocks I hold. However, I resisted the temptation .... for today ....
411 2019-02-05 20:47:28 Remember, last "red" day the pot stocks did well.  In some $ACB calls as well
412 2019-02-05 20:47:22 No, I don't know. I do want to tell you that there is a man who stocks at our local supermarket. Judging by his movements...I think he has cerebral palsy. I've seen him get off the bus, so I think he lives further out (we're city center) and takes bus to work.

414 2019-02-05 20:47:17 I have stocks and there’s millions of us that do. But the majority of Americans do not. We have to think of others less fortunate than ourselves.

419 2019-02-05 20:46:16 I'm weary of buying individual stocks, but if you're going to buy one, $GOOGL should be high on the list. They have 7 separate products with over 1 billion users each, and still have 22% year-over-year growth!  They control the planet.

422 2019-02-05 20:45:08 Interesting what you choose to highlight. The debt is ballooning, 2018 was the worst year for stocks since the recession, manufacturing jobs aren't returning as predicted, tariffs mean Americans are paying more for goods, and the tax cut has mostly helped the 1%.

427 2019-02-05 20:42:26 I read it what’s your point. That you miss understand what she’s talking about and how it’s being done. Is it the question of income and where it comes from. Whether it’s manual labor or stocks. What is it that you don’t understand or can’t comprehend. It’s pretty simple
428 2019-02-05 20:42:15 I hold 3 of your stocks #GDWN #HUR #RRE. In 3 weeks #RRE  9.69% so with some of your cash reserves I would buy more, plus #HUR as both set to rise in near future, IMO !
429 2019-02-05 20:41:00 If stocks keep going higher day after day, then yes. DM. I agree it doesn't make sense. It is part of the box they are in. Don't shoot (or curse) the messenger. They can't let the bubble get too much bigger or nothing will work.
430 2019-02-05 20:40:42 I did hear the stocks go up-and-down obviously but I heard it went really down not too long ago compared to years past. I  Wish we have an actual communications employee discussing these investments or communications with BFV more often since the marketing really hurt this game
431 2019-02-05 20:39:58 Feeling like @DaveEast i really came from nothing. From selling crack to Owning stocks. To @ Warren Buffet, i appreciate your inspiration, i still gotta w

432 2019-02-05 20:39:45 He better mention the glorious market of stocks.....
433 2019-02-05 20:39:30 So since Apex release during were stocks were involved and during this time of year, it was easier to detail a full roadmap whereas a BF game launching at the end of the year where there isn't financial stock investment calls so it's harder to talk about future stuff? Or?
434 2019-02-05 20:38:57 Stocks like this are going to the moon over the next year. #capitalflows
435 2019-02-05 20:38:55 Unless there is some new negative event it’s hard to see a major reversal anytime soon given the record outflow from stocks. Not much size selling left, if anything that money’s has to start flowing back in first. The fed, economy, muted China talk, earnings still point to higher
436 2019-02-05 20:38:54 just one mistake in the tweet - referencing dual mandate.

438 2019-02-05 20:37:50 After the 1930s the Glass-Steagall Act separated retail banking (savings accts & car loans) from investment banking (stocks & investments) to shield people’s savings from risky investing

The banks decided to recombine them and the govt repealed the law instead of penalties.
439 2019-02-05 20:36:37 The S&P500 is trading serenely today, to be at 2738.0 (+0.48%).. Major movers BA +3.26% and PFE -0.61%. Hey @warrenbuffett is this you doing the buying? #itsupontheday #stocks
440 2019-02-05 20:35:41 I need to learn how to invest in stocks
441 2019-02-05 20:35:21 I meant raise rates to deflate asset bubbles. I  2007, you are right, it was not stocks. This time (by the FEDs own admission) equities are part of :"financial conditions."
442 2019-02-05 20:34:49 Agree. Unfortunately many Brits seem to be obsessed with German cars, foreign BEERS et al and even foreign BOTTLED WATER. My local petrol station only stocks Evian and Volvic. Utter madness.
443 2019-02-05 20:34:30 TLDR: if you announce something for the next financial year, you need to bool earnings into that and you don't want to do that since it might lower your expectations for the current one.
No one likes stocks to go down.

447 2019-02-05 20:33:41 That shop on Oxford Street offers relatively little other than prestige/ego for the company.  It is quite small and so stocks little more than most other branches. If you're going to have a branch there you want to be able to offer something more than that 1/2
448 2019-02-05 20:33:25 Look. Trump isn’t going to do this. He has too many friends that own Pharma stocks and sit on their boards. Wish in one hand and poop in the other and see which one fills up faster. He has NO INTEREST IN DOING THIS! He WILL lie to you abt though
449 2019-02-05 20:33:19 Expect most stocks to miss earnings next quarter as well, and have to lower guidance once again

There will always be opportunities, but maybe by then you will have a better picture of the World's economy, trade issues, and what the FED will do
450 2019-02-05 20:33:16 With Apex being basically on top of the swap, they announced 12 month. This happening everywhere where stocks are involved. It is something about earnings recognition. There are probably smarter people than me who can explain it to you.
451 2019-02-05 20:33:14 Dollars flowing into US stocks from all over the globe thats why
452 2019-02-05 20:32:43 The market is still anchored to yesterday's momentum stocks. It tells me that little changed with the most recent correction.

458 2019-02-05 20:29:33 No, you see what you want to see. They were hiking in 2007 because of HOUSING . This time it is stocks,  CRE and leveraged loans.

Capitalism requires capital formation. Capital gains tax should be indexed for inflation.

Companies should be banned from buying back their own stocks.

Dividends & interest from saving accounts should not be taxed.  USA should have financial transactions taxes and more sales

467 2019-02-05 20:24:36 It can’t be said that crypto is still in the boom phase, therefore it’s well into the bust phase. My guess is that stocks will follow in the coming 12 months.

474 2019-02-05 20:20:00 Alphabet spent 22 billion on R&D in the 4th quarter.  

If they maintained that spending for an entire year they would have spent more on R&D than all but 5 COUNTRIES in the world

475 2019-02-05 20:20:00 So is Trump gonna talk about "massive infrastructure spending" tonight and stocks go through the roof? #dejavu
476 2019-02-05 20:19:39 It isn't that hard to understand, DM. If stocks keep rising the FED will tighten rates again. Maybe more than once. They did the EXACT same thing in 2007. kept raising rates until the GFC happened. This time won't be as bad, unless you are a non-bank lender.

BTW -- Pelosi bought oodles of healthcare stocks while ACA was being negotiated.
492 2019-02-05 20:12:38 Byron Jones and Obi both had significant rises in draft stocks after the combine. Byron has turned into a decent player but he was a fringe second round guy that turned into a first after the combine. But I agree with your tape assessment. That’s why I’m not huge on Josh Allen.

500 2019-02-05 20:08:55 Lmao he hasn't "brought back jobs" at all. The economy has been steadily gaining in most respects since the recovery from '08. Those businesses have NOT reinvested their tax savings here, they boosted their stocks and/or offshored it like they always do with tax windfalls.

529 2019-02-05 19:59:58 the higher stocks go the more it is a lock. Fed wants dry powder, because the next recession--whenever we get it--is going to be whopper. QE is a certainty, which is why banks are stockpiling UST like crazy. To flip to the FED after they stop lending to the non-banks.

553 2019-02-05 19:48:41 yea, very sad that this so-called great economy can't handle tiny jump in rates. Still at historical lows - economy might not suck, but it isn't that good. Just easy money so stocks drift higher. Kinda hard to have a lot of faith in long-term

555 2019-02-05 19:48:12 Do you think tax cuts are the problem, or are stock buybacks the problem? Taxes add more to the public sector, money from stocks that does not go to just rebuying stock goes back to private sector employees. See I think Dems overthink this.

657 2019-02-05 19:08:58 Thanks for the very detailed response.  I am looking into starting to invest in some individual stocks. I already have S&P index fund exposure, and am fully invested in a 401K and IRA.  Healthcare to me is the hardest to research/understand, so i like the idea of an ETF.

659 2019-02-05 19:08:21 Think pot stocks are going down for the rest of the week after @CitronResearch tweet and the downgrade on $cron. Won’t see big moves down like on the upside but drip drip drip down. Will come back on Thursday or Friday, till then always 1 eye on it
660 2019-02-05 19:08:02 @timseymour what's with the POT stocks? Just rolling over?
661 2019-02-05 19:07:58 $VYST  FYI FORM 4 means Insiders are Buying.   WE WANT TO BE IN STOCKS WHERE INSIDERS ARE BUYING!  That is a great barometer for the belief in the company

674 2019-02-05 19:01:56 Stop deramping my stocks
675 2019-02-05 19:01:25 Being defensive for me means:
 Selling weak stocks without a follow through, showing a loss or reversal. $ETSY, $BEAT, $ACB. Can buy back anytime.
 Selling stocks with blow-off tops or were the chance-risk-ratio is not acceptable. $CRON
 Be more selective in taking trades.
676 2019-02-05 19:00:49 More money than hate. They all have stocks in the War Machine
677 2019-02-05 19:00:29 Wouldn't taxing buybacks be double taxation in this case as you tax capital gains once stocks are sold? I'd be inclined to point at incentive structure of corporates who currently leverage to buy back rather than invest in capex.
678 2019-02-05 18:59:16 $gs analyst says if you missed January stock rebound you’ve likely missed most the gains for 2019. So long as you didn’t chase stocks beyond their fair valuation in most recent weeks, you can potentially enter positions on the next pullback.

The S&P 500 was little changed as it sought a fifth straight advance in volumes 15 percent below the 30-day average at this time of day. The relative calm in markets belies an undercurrent of uncertainty…
683 2019-02-05 18:57:12 If the market is starting to change I see it at first in my portfolio and my #stocks. Often I give back a bunch of open profits, weaker stocks start to reverse and stronger ones goes sideway. That's the time to be more defensive.
684 2019-02-05 18:56:53 For those with full-time job & lack of tech skills, i.e me, holding stocks longer is better than in&out frequently. $adbe returned 40% held it for 8 monthsish. It covered some of my losses and with profit :). $ba gave me 20% this yr. Did some math and Im making more by holding.
685 2019-02-05 18:56:16 The S&P500 is trading to bring your retirement closer today, but has come down from the days highs, to be at 2728.0 (+0.78%). One persons algo is another persons front runner. #lottaalgosoutthere #stocks

691 2019-02-05 18:52:34 I get that, but I would've liked to know that stocks dropping = "your job isn't as secure as we've been telling you." It doesnt matter your division, it doesn't matter your success or division's success, just that "we" have a deficit at the moment and wish to temporarily fix it

712 2019-02-05 18:44:08 Shares are bought back from shareholders not banks (i.e. institutional funds or retail investors) and the capital is most likely reinvested in other stocks.  Banks make commissions off facilitating buybacks.  Your take is both uninformed and almost as irresponsible as @sensanders

The most fictional part of this tweet is the idea of me having a stock broker or purchasing stocks.

740 2019-02-05 18:30:39 In other words we shrink Walmart stock and buy Amazon. But people just buy more failing stocks to sell later when they are higher. They don't invest in fundamentals. The point is if you give away free money everyone should get it, not just people who already have some.

I'm with you. No of stocks >200 DMA at 58.2% with MID and SML not far behind. Should see more stocks at new highs if that keeps up.
849 2019-02-05 17:44:30 $SPX, remember folks, every micro dip here is a buying opportunity.  We will hit new all time highs without any meaningful move down because earnings were not as good as guidance. That's good for stocks apparently..

875 2019-02-05 17:32:33 Agreed but I doubt many have held  for 13 years hoping to recover their losses. A 7 year high should be good enough. In which case that particular layer of sellers that often hinders recovery stocks will not be around IMO.
876 2019-02-05 17:32:22 FYI: Everyone with assets is moving their wealth offshore, to foreign accounts. So when the dollar collapses, their real wealth (gold, silver, and untaxed cash) is safe and sound. They're unloading stocks which will fail. They speak in code on the news of their actions.

885 2019-02-05 17:29:33 Except "The economy" is not doing well right now. Shareholders are making loads of money, but the price of stocks is not a reflection on the economy.

896 2019-02-05 17:23:58 But it’s better than bonds, proper research into the company, business model and access to funding is good before investing in stocks. Bonds are less riskier but less rewarding. Better buying emerging stocks than a bond

904 2019-02-05 17:21:44 Well, Stelter, you and CNN, laughing stocks of the media, have absolutely no "power to persuade" anyone the real world with your subversive, left-wing propaganda. The fact that the MSM lies and twists every statement by President Trump harms our country. Journalism is dead.

907 2019-02-05 17:20:02 What’s wrong with them profiting from their investment? If you don’t think it’s right for wealthy families to make money investing in stocks when they go up, then you should be honest and just advocate for abolishing hedge funds and imposing socialism.
908 2019-02-05 17:19:58 Please dont take it as criticism. Its not.  It was my lead in to what others do.  How they play them.  It was a stupid question regarding stocks that blow higher right at the open.  Its  fomo thing.   Hard to watch a 5%er.
909 2019-02-05 17:18:39 Proverbs 7:22b-23 AB
Or as one in stocks going to the correction [to be given] to a fool,

Until an arrow pierced his liver [with a mortal wound];
Like a bird fluttering straight into the net,
He did not know that it would cost him his life.

They actually are the more profitable that ever been. The stocks dropp it's for several, one is because investor want even more money lol
937 2019-02-05 17:10:09 Giving tax cuts to the wealthy does do not any of that.  Wealthy people do not spend all their money on purchases. Buying stocks makes them wealthier but doesn't help the economy.  It doesn't create more jobs. People spending money for services or goods does create jobs

942 2019-02-05 17:08:23 @ewarren @SenSchumer @BernieSanders anyone who wants to and is motivated and disciplined to grow their savings can participate in dividends and share buybacks.  I am not wealthy but put a portion of my paycheck into stocks and mutual funds for the benefit of compounding.
943 2019-02-05 17:08:02 Many people that aren’t rich have 401k’s and hold stocks or mutual funds which is a group of stocks. Bottom line, companies have to be profitable. It affects us in receiving corporate taxes, domestic jobs, and stock market. It affects you too.

963 2019-02-05 16:57:23 Real reason behind recent runup in marijuana stocks is short squeeze, according to The Arora Report. In a short squeeze, investors who previously sold short are either forced to buy to cover their shorts or feel compelled to buy to cover at higher and higher prices.
964 2019-02-05 16:56:51 I'm fine with people getting rich playing with money if they're facilitating a useful industry, but not rich people getting richer speculating stocks around in a circle jerk.

975 2019-02-05 16:49:43 They pay other rich people to buy stock in companies that dont get the money.
The only time stocks give a company actual income is when the stock is coming directly from a company aka IPO
So basically they do very little to impact the economy compared to their employees

1054 2019-02-05 16:17:53 That’s a great question Doug. With the back and forth China has done with their stocks we chose to not adjust China at this time. If the USDA does reverse themselves as China has I don’t believe it will be a shock to the markets.

1060 2019-02-05 16:15:45 @kroyrunner89 morning Tim, at last Fall's Summit I noticed on the screen you had three charts up with three level two boxes at the same time. Was that with stocks to trade or was that interactive brokers platform?
1061 2019-02-05 16:15:30 "Total return" on there now 

It's been an impressive move off the lows. Tough to be bearish stocks with such strength in a market segment all the gurus are warning the most about.
1062 2019-02-05 16:15:18 My understanding is that trade always equalizes.  The only way it doesn't is if they sit on US dollars (literally put the dollars under a mattress).  Since noone does this the balance of trade is equal - the “deficit” is equalized by China investing in the US via bonds,stocks,etc

1092 2019-02-05 16:07:11 Capital gains is not earned income (I.e stocks, real estate). Capital gains in paper money, is not real money, and not earned, so therefore should be taxed. Inheritance is not earned income either and therefore should be taxed.

1098 2019-02-05 16:02:54 I have a universe of stocks defined by a couple rather wide screens. Then I screen for tight and quiet action and undercut and rally move over the day. The setups I trade are mainly pullbacks with a tight range on muted volume, buyable gap ups. The former is the holy grail!
1099 2019-02-05 16:02:13 i only do that shit when im playing with friends 

and honestly when you're a newer player you might not be nearly as confident but either way taking rounds/stocks from someone you think you're going to lose from is a big mark of personal progress to that kinda person
1100 2019-02-05 16:02:06 People buy equal weight if they believe in the size factor premium (smaller stocks produce higher returns due to higher risk). In the past, this has produced higher returns than market cap weighting. No telling what happens going forward.

1129 2019-02-05 15:51:33 So, I don't understand why the media hasn't picked up on this in its totality, but there are A LOT of layoffs happening across the country from big corporations.

1131 2019-02-05 15:49:20 @PiyushGoyal Govt will probably do well to instruct LIC to buy a few good quality midcaps and small caps aggressively. This would help lift the sentiment in markets. While Nifty is up 6%, midcaps and smallcaps are down over 30%. Stocks available at ridiculous valuations.

1134 2019-02-05 15:47:49 When you inherit stocks, you never pay taxes on the gain made during the deceased' lifetime ~ it's called a bump up and it is a wonderful tax break. Say your dad bought a stock for $10 & it was worth $100 when he died.  Unless his estate was worth over 5.5M ind/11M joint

1152 2019-02-05 15:41:40 I tend to think that the market might trade more like it did in #JesseLivermore's day...when the trusts and pools had all the money and could drive stocks back and forth...today we have big investment banks wielding cheap money and machines to push things around...

1206 2019-02-05 15:25:35 Wall St has the ability to invest on margin. Stocks trade at multiples of earnings. Some companies make no money, but are worth billions. And when greed destroys the market, they get public bailouts.

Those who benefit from these extreme perks deserve to pay a 70% marginal rate.

1277 2019-02-05 15:00:34 What goes up must come down. Aurora Cannabis is down 2.3%, Cronos Group is down 7.4% this morning after hitting all-time highs yesterday. Completely wiped out what I had gained on these stocks. Hoping they rebound later today. @Aurora_MMJ @CronosGroupMJN

1320 2019-02-05 14:47:27 So much for Trickledown economics. The corporations used their tax break to buy back stocks not to create jobs or increase wages. Trump’s tax plan helped no one but the rich.

1322 2019-02-05 14:46:50 if Chinas tariffs go up to 25% from the current 10% in less than a month it will be like pouring gasoline on an inflation fire, reason stocks have always gone up over last 100 years is cause inflation rarely ever stops, Trumps sugar highs with tax cuts tariffs are accelerating it
1323 2019-02-05 14:46:04 The stock was at 330 back in September. It got hammered in the tech pullback, but was recovering with rest of tech stocks. Acquisition puts stock back at same price. To be honest, timing seems odd — should have waited.

1473 2019-02-05 13:53:29 Maintaining housing stocks never been the Council's strong point. But the culture adopted at the top needs to change. It's totally out of sync with #wellbeing and morality.

1474 2019-02-05 13:53:19 It's worse than that. If it was a shadowy government organization (aka BoJ, PBOC) stocks would only go up temporarily and quickly crash down. But if it's the corporates relentlessly buying back their own shares...(and, yes, US mkt is quite exceptional in that)

1521 2019-02-05 13:34:02 Stocks have gained, but are still unstable imo. Before the talks, Trump was actively egging on Kim Jong Un to fire a missile at this place. Only after EVERYONE ELSE said for him (Trump) to cool his jets, did he talk.

1530 2019-02-05 13:29:29 Viewpoint - The Market has no life, can’t make up a mind it doesn’t have, and only reacts to money. Money going in, or money going out. There is no other place the huge money is going. Think about it. Keep thinking. They tell me, there is room to run in Stocks, if you look, see.
1531 2019-02-05 13:28:27 #Servoinsights

There’s opportunity in volatility. Over all 10-yr periods since 1928:

The US stock market beat bonds (5YR T-Notes) 82% of the time by an average of +5.2%/yr

A 60/40 mix of US Large & Small Value stocks beat the US market 84% of the time by an average of +3.2%/yr
1532 2019-02-05 13:27:58 My taxes went up several thousand dollars. That would be okay if I thought the money was going towards the poor, but instead it went to corporate millionaires who used it to buy back stocks and increase their wealth. I HATE REPUBLICANS!!!
1533 2019-02-05 13:27:39 What did the Fed actually say that so sooooooo dovish? Nothing. Just that all options are on the table. But while idiots are buying stocks the Fed continues QT with $14b UST rolling off its balance sheet tomorrow.
1534 2019-02-05 13:27:38 You're responding with a completely different fact. I wrote 54% of Americans own (some) stock. Combined with your info we could say 54% of Americans own 16% of available stocks. Don't get me wrong. There is gross income and wealth inequality.
1535 2019-02-05 13:26:59 You can see clearly on my profile what stocks I think are overrated and overvalued.

1537 2019-02-05 13:26:50 yes, its something interesting re Mutual Funds & ETFs (which I believe is the chart below)

There was an article a couple of weeks ago I believe on Bloomberg that was saying that investors have been buying single stocks vs funds... so the below would not capture that

1539 2019-02-05 13:25:56 In mcap weighted index stocks are giving weights as per their market cap. Im case of equal weights, stock are assigned equal weights. Both has its advantages and limitations. Good or bad depends on your investment profile & requirements.
1540 2019-02-05 13:24:17 The Wall is obvious and probably already priced into certain stocks. (who knows though).  Pharma/Bio comments will be interesting and could have a major impact on the $IBB , as well as individual pharma stocks. (IBB is the bio/pharma ETF)

1629 2019-02-05 12:33:18 Indian steel firms are putting pressure on the nation's government to impose higher duties on imports as trade disputes and a global economic slowdown divert surplus Asian steel stocks to India, industry executives and government sources said.

1631 2019-02-05 12:31:48 I was thinking a couple of days in stocks in the town square would be a suitably safe space.

And the same should apply regardless of the races involved.

No double standards.

1636 2019-02-05 12:27:57 In times like these, there is a temptation to sell some of your blue chip stocks which haven’t corrected much and buy the beaten down small/mid caps. Avoid that temptation like plague.
1637 2019-02-05 12:27:52 @Morning_Joe Shultz absolutely not.  Billionaires have set up a system that rewards themselves, cohorts, and families to the detriment of the rest of us.  Remember what happened with the recent tax cut for the wealthy.  Turned around and leveraged their stocks.
1638 2019-02-05 12:27:51 When you’re talking investments are you referring to stocks? Or like iras/401ks? Cause ya know sharings caring 
1639 2019-02-05 12:26:05 Ah, talks about stocks, businesses and international politics. That's what I'm for.
1640 2019-02-05 12:25:55 Plus it encourages giving tax breaks to the wealthy because 80%(roughly) of stocks are owned by upper classes meanwhile homeless people starve but if the stock market is good everyone thinks the economy is good which in turn gives politicians incentive for tax breaks for the rich

1643 2019-02-05 12:23:36 Stocks, pillories and guillotines have a romantic appeal in these circumstances.
1644 2019-02-05 12:22:43 Yeah but also if you care abt the return OF (your)capital, you should buy stocks b/c the rtn OF your capital will be wayyyy higher than if you buys bonds.  Ha ha ha!

1646 2019-02-05 12:22:09 I have also invested in stock market and have been doing since 15 years. Stock market will always have stocks up n down n not controlled by any government. As a proactive investor you need to understand long term n short term and balance the stocks when it declines.
1647 2019-02-05 12:21:55 Boosting stock prices over nothing but buying a lot of stocks seems like it make a company lazy. Why invest in R&D and employee when they can just buy a lot of stock back to raise prices . Especially since most high ups are paid in stock options .

1657 2019-02-05 12:15:01 Ojo, que yo creo que CFK es lo peor que le pasó al país desde 1983. Y uno de los peores gobiernos de la historia.

1670 2019-02-05 12:05:26 Buxton were honest and said they didn't trust enough pubs to serve it properly iirc. 

I think if you feel you have to dictate who stocks it, don't bother. You make any pub that's not allowed to sell it look shite and that's not a nice way to treat potential customers of keg

1685 2019-02-05 11:50:32 Do NOT make major decisions on stocks until the "cloaking"of information stops.The window of hidden matters still continues as a theme today.
1686 2019-02-05 11:49:51 Very true Lance but markets don't always reflect what currently is, but often future sentiment. Many firms taking 5/10 year positions and if many stocks like Amazon and Apple are still in bear territory then I can see blind optimism driving us higher?

1692 2019-02-05 11:43:38 It’s a little more complex than that. Buy backs help underwrite funded pensions for workers, raises earnings per share which helps company stock options which helps workers as well as outside investors who hold those stocks in their 401K plans.
1693 2019-02-05 11:43:36 I agree @PisceanGun , I was really surprised at how mild the final report was.  I was hoping for some engineered bad news and a massive shakeout.

1. Bad idea to carry overnight stocks with strong closing (jublfood, airtel). exceptions NIFTY heavy weights. 
2. Play safe, stick with NIFTY large caps if you are bullish.
3. Avoid buying weak stocks which are near support, the supports will likely break. :) #nifty

1729 2019-02-05 11:16:37 You know how "OG's" say zoom out and slow down?
Totally right. The trouble with crypto people is they never learned patience. Trade stocks for a few years and understand gains compound if you wait. It can take years but you'll do better spending time to find LONGTERM entries.

1752 2019-02-05 11:00:24 Monday's moves come after #Dow and #Nasdaq posted their 6th straight weekly gains last week. S&P 500 also notched its 5th one-week gain in 6. #Stocks completed last week their best monthly gain since October 2015 with S&P 500 notching its largest one-month rise since 1987. #SPX
1753 2019-02-05 11:00:16 The dividend portfolio had a big week with all 36 stocks closing higher, led by #LVMH, #AssaAbloy and #Diageo. #Honeywell and #EastmanChemical have started with 13,7% and 14,7% gains since my January 3 purchase. Also 6 stocks have already raised their #dividend in 2019.
1754 2019-02-05 10:59:19 Dear Amro, first of all, this is your point of view. in my opinion it's ridiculous just to talk and judge without even trying to do something useful or successful in your life. starting a business from scratch it's even riskier to invest in stocks for the long run for example.
1755 2019-02-05 10:56:04 Yep because the performance of 30 stocks is reflective of the economy as a whole.
1756 2019-02-05 10:55:48 A lot of stocks I own or follow feel very close to breakout: BUR, CAML, GENL, RRE, SOLG would all look great if they could move a little bit north.

1760 2019-02-05 10:52:03 Poppycock! You plan on passing a bill to limit the profits of people that invested in the stocks? Do you also plan on nationalizing the companies,  too?
1761 2019-02-05 10:51:25 Most investors drew comfort from rising stock prices. Now it is the other way around. Prices are falling and no one wants to touch these stocks. So they will fall more.

1819 2019-02-05 09:59:40 Best strategy is to buy now the good value stocks from these 5000 make 3-4x and then shift to RIL or HDFCs. You will be in good profit even if they correct by 20-30%. Important thing is to have courage and foresightedness.

1852 2019-02-05 09:34:40 Lower interest rates mean higher value of real assets / stocks and more benefit to capital class. Low interest rates only help traders and inventory holders, to play musical chair. You can include banks and hedge funds too in traders’ definition. So no long term real impact!
1853 2019-02-05 09:34:39 I write program for each strategy for back testing. There are no tools available which can do back test of custom strategy. 

If you just need data of last 6 months for your stocks, then I can share you that offline.
1854 2019-02-05 09:34:29 Obviously that’s a little extreme! But, if there was a problem getting hold of the chemicals or for there being a short period without stocks, it could cause serious short term problems in many communities.

1865 2019-02-05 09:26:42 The estate tax is based on the *value* of the estate, not the income. The value of the assets, for example real estate, stocks etc., have merely appreciated. There is a step up in basis so that the gain on sale will be that much less. Pfft to the double-taxation argument.

1909 2019-02-05 08:52:15 Lower interest rates mean higher value of real assets / stocks and more benefit to capital class. Low interest rates only help traders and inventory holders, to play musical chair. You can include banks and hedge funds too in traders’ definition. So no long term real impact!

1921 2019-02-05 08:40:13 @Zerodha treats only liquid bees as cash equivalent. It requires atleast 50% cash for option selling against any other collateral. Even in that it doesn't take mutual funds or FDs as collateral..only some stocks n liquid funds. 
Any brokerage which gives better terms ?
1922 2019-02-05 08:39:38 In my limited experience, most of the cyclical stocks are termed as value stocks in India. When cycle turns, people get screwed.

2131 2019-02-05 05:35:47 So what's that look like Bernard? You want companies to be less successful and less profitable so stocks are cheaper and more people can afford them?
2132 2019-02-05 05:34:47 Given the unbelievable madness of the almost entire political elite of the UK, we have now started to prepare for #hardbrexit - storing lab supplies that might become difficult to get hold of and ingredients for #Drosophila food to be able to maintain stocks for a while.

@KatyPatterson12 - honestly it would help population, the stock market would go down.

2137 2019-02-05 05:29:20 Politics aside, buybacks are ridiculous, they were also the last phase before the great depression to keeps stocks inflated and investors happy, but that didn't work out so well.
2138 2019-02-05 05:28:51 Does this mean you will stop the homie stocks
2139 2019-02-05 05:27:56 Is there a good reason why finance websites don't report abnormal returns for stocks daily? Ditto for news stories that mention a stock price change supposedly in response to news? Yes, there are varying approaches but a plain vanilla market model would be better than nothing.
2140 2019-02-05 05:27:21 Stocks?

2144 2019-02-05 05:24:04 My Satrix Top 40 ETF is actually up 0.92% over the last month but my portfolio is down 0.26% overall because of my exposure to international ETFs and other individual stocks

2175 2019-02-05 05:01:13 Tricky, there would be some who are just resentful, others probably because of having crap stocks flogged to them by people who they feel misled them. Of course it's easy to say they are dumb for buying based on others but most people starting look for guidance and have no idea.
2176 2019-02-05 05:01:10 The market has long gone past any such logic. When rates were close to 0, the logic used to be the discounting rate makes stocks "expensive but reasonable". With rising rates, they still find some logic. Any reason to scream BUY. Till it falls...

2189 2019-02-05 04:47:31 Sir with the kind of stocks that have fallen .. the primary question is .. are there any honest managements? .. recent fall has happened in the top brands in the country that have been in existence for decades and were supposed to have respectable mgmt ..
2190 2019-02-05 04:47:10 Stocks are a security and can be traded... being designated a security wouldn't be the end of XRP, being labeled a scam would be. Although, it isn't a scam so there isn't much to worry about. The asset does what it claims to do.
2191 2019-02-05 04:47:02 I love mine too, but you should have the basic understanding that nothing has changed. Sure there are plastic stocks and grips, but semi-auto firearms are basically the same as 100 years ago.
2192 2019-02-05 04:44:28 @bobby100 $VIPS I don't typically like stocks under $10, especially after it going under $5 recently.  I can profit with less risk elsewhere
2193 2019-02-05 04:43:06 how many fund managers whooping up a storm with petitions.. Wilson did and plenty of others.

2196 2019-02-05 04:42:04 Absolutely correct as illustrated by the healthy increases in bank stocks today.
2197 2019-02-05 04:40:50 Individuals or Stocks who became great locally or globally began their life as simple & small size, so anything small should not be looked down upon or called as #Bhangaarcap

2202 2019-02-05 04:37:53 What’s appealing about KushCo to you? Btw, I started off trading in Crypto, so volatile stocks don’t phase me.
2203 2019-02-05 04:37:41 Did we not have a 1 day 15% rip back in 2000 on the qqq? The market oscillates between overbought and oversold along the main trend, its overbought now so a pullback to oversold with fewer stocks making new lows would be very welcome, at least by me. 
2204 2019-02-05 04:37:09 I made some cheese from 2 of those stocks
2205 2019-02-05 04:36:34 So now the radical leftists like you want to redistribute the stocks owned by the top 10 percent to those who didn't work hard enough to earn it. What's next? Should the top 10 percent share their homes with the homeless? Do you want to redistribute IRA accounts also? Insanity!!
2206 2019-02-05 04:35:39 The data company is a company that would develop into a data center, and hopefully become in charge of the data in companies through data counting, data providing and data using.

2212 2019-02-05 04:32:18 The fact bank stocks bounced today says they're not worried about their bottom-line at all.

2223 2019-02-05 04:28:48 Trump has called for a bump stock ban.  Most rational people don't give two craps about bump stocks.  They care about a right taken away and feeling less secure.  And the loudest voices from the left are threats to this basic right.  It's that simple.
2224 2019-02-05 04:28:05 Very similar to myself.  I built a little following while I was bearish.  Now it's quiet..the only thing that I changed was that international capital flows decided stocks won in January.  I'm just looking at data.

2232 2019-02-05 04:21:42 This is the truth and people are blind to it. Its literally disgusting. These billionaires didnt work as hard as my father and its sickening that some people think they have. When you inherit millions, and 10,000 is pocket change, you can invest in the stocks daddy tells you to.
2233 2019-02-05 04:21:07 The real "theft of taxable income" that takes place in death is the stepped up basis of stocks that heirs receive. Rich guy buys $1 mil in stock. At his death 30 years later it's worth $11 mil. Kids inherit it without EVER paying taxes on the $10 mil growth. THAT = Rigged System!

For e.g.. U have three names u can put more than one lakh in each account in nationalised & pvt banks

2268 2019-02-05 03:49:14 We will restrict corporate stock buybacks when the stock market collapses after corporations run out of cash from cash hoarding and trump tax cuts.

They buyback stocks to enrich executives & the rich shareholders.

2269 2019-02-05 03:48:02 @Abhishekkar_ ji read your message on telegram. should also exit from good nifty top 10 stocks?
2270 2019-02-05 03:48:01 All pot stocks began pulling back around same time today.  Most recovered somewhat but TLRY did not.  Wouldn’t read too much into it as it still has good chance to run big into late February..
2271 2019-02-05 03:47:33 Long positions have been the way to go on most stocks.
2272 2019-02-05 03:46:30 I heard on the radio before the election, people who lost a lot of money on those stocks because of Collins were still going to vote for him because he was better than  the Democrat . I  hope they lost everything. Stupid fn people.
2273 2019-02-05 03:46:09 Sen Drilon is working on behalf of PLDT and GLOBE. Not to the people that deserve a better Telco service. Or he is simple protection his shares of stocks invested to the 2 giant Telco?
2274 2019-02-05 03:45:35 Sorry Australia,  The Royal Commission is a complete scam this is proven by the stocks for Banks screaming higher today. Anyone hard done by banks can forget any recourse and no Bankster is going to jail. Australia you have been scammed

2279 2019-02-05 03:43:44 So #RoyalCommission recommendations are in & bank stocks go up? This is the ultimate stitch up! Throw all your brokers under the bus, consolidate your power & then start rate creeping! This RC has been a joke! Or maybe this is the calm b4 the storm until @AustralianLabor get in?
2280 2019-02-05 03:42:21 Holy shit my stocks on @Stash are up 17%
2281 2019-02-05 03:42:12 So you are saying you are incapable of generating wealth on your own huh?  Someone is intentionally stopping you from acquiring wealth?  You can't save, You can't purchase a home, you can't buy stocks because someone already has them all? No pie for you.
2282 2019-02-05 03:41:36 My first trades were made in September 2008 - I purchased puts on many blue chip stocks. That first profit experience created a bearish bias in me... On top of it, I followed doom and gloom "preachers" and Elliot Wave magicians who "brainwashed" me into a "bear".
2283 2019-02-05 03:41:27 small sizes is good to start and learn and get better over time, and my top students and I have made millions with these small stocks that everyone rips on, so we appreciate when people don't want to trade them!
2284 2019-02-05 03:41:24 Yeah when stash got the mj etf i went for it for fun and staying at over a couple sgares. Thinking of just doing the 4 big mj stocks on m1.

27100/26920 is  support at banknifty future 27340/450 resistance!
2290 2019-02-05 03:38:59 BERNIE HOW MANY STOCKS DID YOU BUY WITH THE MONEY YOUR WIFE & YOU STOLE FROM THE COLLEGE?? HOW MUCH WAS IT 2.5 MILLION??
2291 2019-02-05 03:38:34 That absolutely sounds like it should be illegal. How can they hold shares in something which their very decision making directly impacts how those stocks would behave? If it’s illegal to have insider knowledge, they’re creating the knowledge. I mean, just seems shady af.
2292 2019-02-05 03:36:43 My falcon always loses 2 stocks, I bring them down to last stock last hit and I lose anyways.
2293 2019-02-05 03:36:05 As a full disclaimer for anyone following me and my stocks thruout each day, I recently purchased another beach property and pulled most of my funds out of my trading account so I will be swing trading for the time being until I build my account back to daytrade compliance
2294 2019-02-05 03:35:46 I was told I needed about $25,000 to “professionally day trade “ is that true ? #DayTrading #Daytrader #stocks
2295 2019-02-05 03:34:39 The wild gyrations of the #StockMarket last November & December have reinforced once again that going forward there might be a false sense of security investing in #stocks 
There is no explanation or investigation by the #SEC of what happened & what this might be a prelude to
2296 2019-02-05 03:33:52 "Under this proposal, trades would be taxed at a rate of 0.5% for stocks, 0.1% for bonds, and 0.005% for derivatives."

That would completely stop trading as we know it and is insane.

0.1% is $100 to buy 100k of bonds??  1/32nd on 100k is $31.25  so 3 full ticks?
2297 2019-02-05 03:33:26 True only of the cost of stocks and real estate.....not the gains.  Unrealized capital gains make up over 55% of the assets of estates over $100m. These would never be taxed with repeal of the estate tax and step up basis...not once let alone twice.
2298 2019-02-05 03:32:50 Indiabull stocks are risky.. their stocks are down more than 50% and looks like no recovery.
2299 2019-02-05 03:31:43 The thing is they really don't have that money. Yes, on paper they do. They have stocks, so if they got a million shares of a company and the share costs ten $, they got ten million $. But if they tried to sell ALL their shares, their price would sink like lead into the sea.

2301 2019-02-05 03:31:09 What do you think about the current valuation of marijuana stocks?
2302 2019-02-05 03:30:08 Canadian cannabis stock index up 60% since start of the year. Unfortunately, most Canadians were too busy investing in weed to invest in weed stocks.
2303 2019-02-05 03:28:55 The future. Talking to someone like you removes a lot of that pressure and anxiety. I’m 17, own my own landscaping company, tried penny stocks, trade options, have my own dropshipping store,etc. Everyday I get yelled at by my parents to focus on school and not making money.
2304 2019-02-05 03:28:49 There is misperception trading specs . That profits are big. True that they are however so are losses and volume turns off on a switch. MUCH Safer trading decent stocks with steady long term volume .
2305 2019-02-05 03:27:04 How are your stocks doing there, Chuckie?  Nothing more than hyperbole B.S., you fool no one.

2314 2019-02-05 03:20:40 The speed at which stocks have rallied suggests to me that market makers are in a panic rush to liquidate stocks. Fast. Why? We'll find out soon i suppose
Remember: larger investors sell rallies not declines.

2316 2019-02-05 03:20:13 Expect market to open on a flat note. U.S. stocks rose nearly 1% for a fourth day, with technology shares leading the advance in thin trading ahead of a fresh batch of earnings reports. #MOMarketUpdates

2320 2019-02-05 03:16:35 It's an equal-weighted index of a list of stocks, but they are averaged geometrically instead of arithmetically.

2324 2019-02-05 03:11:29 Right. That's why when a bad earnings report comes out many of these stocks take a severe hit because they ran up too far on anticipated performance (see $APPL)

2326 2019-02-05 03:09:37 Retail employees at Walmart are not responsible for profits, and are not entitled to stocks unless they buy them personally. If Walmart changes its business model to service-oriented, that may be a different story.  But they won’t. And the government can’t make them do that.

2385 2019-02-05 02:37:28 Are you saying that people alcant buy stocks if they want to?  Because if they can, it would seem the lower 90% of households don’t really want to buy that many stocks.

2389 2019-02-05 02:35:52 $APHA @jimcramer Mr. Cramer, you used to make stocks move as you needed. You have much more influence now. Have you any thoughts on the short report and subsequent rise of Aphria?

2391 2019-02-05 02:35:43 The past two years have been significantly better for workers than the eight years that proceeded them. I happen to know scores of 'workers', I'm one of them. Like many, I work and own stocks. We don't want your or @SenSanders' socialism. We know where that path leads.

2393 2019-02-05 02:32:18 Well, I don’t think it’s a win. Banning bump stocks, if they actually did that, isn’t nearly enough. That’s why Congress is working on a bill to reform the laws. If it doesn’t happen now, it will in 2020.
2394 2019-02-05 02:31:38 Stocks, Options & Investing, let’s make millions! Stock recommendation $ivst $sode @EagleBrookCap
2395 2019-02-05 02:31:18 That's not true at all. A semiautomatic needs machining to convert it to a machine gun. Bump stocks just mimic automatic fire by slightly increasing the rate of fire (still less than that of an automatic)

2412 2019-02-05 02:20:46 The smh article on the Commission report seem to imply that the recommendations are kinda toothless... Maybe that's why the stocks are up?

2419 2019-02-05 02:16:17 Having a hard time letting go Chaikin Money flow. Had good success with it early on, but lately just distracts from super stocks making good moves. It's a lagging indicator.
2420 2019-02-05 02:15:44 401 k are related to those buy backs. Jobs are created it’s your fault u didn’t sign up for a match it’s free money. We have more millionaires in 401k than ever before. Buybacks make stocks go higher so your 401k grows. Stop feeding false knowledge to those who have no idea.
2421 2019-02-05 02:15:13 I was bracing myself but all my bank stocks are actually up today, after the royal commission report. I can't figure out what swings the herd on these things at all.. I would take the opportunity to sell but they're all still worse off than when I bought them 
2422 2019-02-05 02:14:22 you're still not going to get me to sell my stocks in Gritty. he's going to rally.

2440 2019-02-05 02:06:15 Should be,but judging by the surge of bank stocks on the share market looks like they’ve received a slap on the wrist with a wet lettuce. What’s the betting that not ONE criminal charge will be laid ! We’re not Iceland so no repercussions!
2441 2019-02-05 02:06:10 I’m a year into learning how to trade. I haven’t done much day trading, it (day trading) seems a little overwhelming. Overall, I’ve put about 15k into various penny stocks and I’m only down about 3k. I look forward to learning more.
2442 2019-02-05 02:05:59 Simply put $1000 that a rich person saves from not paying taxes will go to a relatively unproductive use - stocks, bonds, savings or overseas. That same $1000 that a poor person does not pay in taxes goes straight back into the economy. That is good for *everybody*.

As to CSRA in soil profiles, yes this would allow you to get kt rather than kz, however CSRA is neither cheap or quick, and 14Catmos in last 300yrs might make it tricky?

2481 2019-02-05 01:37:13 We did this for awhile at my old firm. Maybe not surprisingly, the stocks did fairly well as they were so ugly/hated/problematic that they were cheap enough to go up. Best way to pick the worst stocks vs worst companies was to aim for the mediocre middle. Those did underperform.

2498 2019-02-05 01:27:20 Corporations are full of people who work and pay taxes. Why do seem to be against working people? Everyone can buy stocks in publicly traded corporations and own a piece of that company. Many pension funds and everyday people invested their own money.
2499 2019-02-05 01:25:57 Eh, bump stocks were just banned. How is that working out? I'm genuinely asking, I fell out of the loop on it.
2500 2019-02-05 01:24:59 Wrong:  most stocks are in mutual funds that everyday Americans are counting on for their retirement in Roth IRAs and other investments.
2501 2019-02-05 01:24:47 Hey Bernie! Are all Shareholders wealthy? Some maybe, but most are just like you and me. I think you are making assumptions But I love the ban on buy backs - you'll hurt the stock market & small players & create great wealth when the stocks crash. You will help the wealthy grow!

2513 2019-02-05 01:18:55 Have you released your financial disclaimers as required? What are you worth, what properties do you own, what stocks and bonds do you own?
2514 2019-02-05 01:17:49 But if I have my money in stocks.. that means I have my money invested in people to try to make an idea grow.. You think I should have to pull that money out every year?

2516 2019-02-05 01:17:28 Dear twiter followers. I am working on an automated system for tweeting about stocks and financial securities. So you will probably see this account is a little more active in the comming weeks. I estimate about one tweet per day to start.
2517 2019-02-05 01:17:10 Earnings on the big stocks are coming in okay but most likely due to stock buy backs and again the trade war is still going strong. Google earnings today did very little are we at an exhaustion point here for buyers. REMEMBER it is PRO's that move this mkt. not the working
2518 2019-02-05 01:16:14 The current system is such that many voters, esp. retirees, depend on income from stocks. You don’t have to be a wheeler dealer to have a 401K.

2530 2019-02-05 01:10:38 Comprehensive study! I really like Figure 2. Sounds like mostly good news! "Mean standardized #spawning stock #biomass indicated Northeast #Atlantic #fish stocks declined to minimum @ beginning of 21st century, then sharply increased to levels comparable to 1970s" Important info!
2531 2019-02-05 01:10:17 Yes, the only issue is earning coming out and advertising business is not generating enough ROI, that's what I heard.
On a personal level this is one of the 4 stock stocks those burnt my pocket badly, last year.
2532 2019-02-05 01:09:50 I did it for twenty five! Still wasn’t a millionaire. I bought stock in the company I worked for. $25 per payday for 15 years. When I left I got a check for 37 cents. It seems it does make difference what kind of stocks you buy! General or Preferred?!
2533 2019-02-05 01:08:00 ...believe me, I'm far from wealthy. I own many of the same stocks that wealthy people do, I just own less of it and I'm fine with that. I, and everyone I work with would like the portion of the stock market we own to grow.
2534 2019-02-05 01:07:06 You forget to mention that millions of middle class workers hold these stocks in their 401ks! They are not rich and depend on these stocks to continue to rise.  Poeple getting played off know it's coming, shame on them for not planning ahead!

2536 2019-02-05 01:06:37 Since September. Over 200 Billion dollars. 
Listen...you don't know shit about stocks or economy...you just discovered that your iPhone has a stock market app...so idk what to say about that.
Why i'm "winging" about it? Because those YT-ers up there are doing damage control.
2537 2019-02-05 01:06:06 Pennsylvania because of the stocks.
2538 2019-02-05 01:05:12 Firstly, i never said that Apple is done. Secondly, Goldman Sachs was right because Apple sales are down and XR model has underperformed.
Apple stocks are down since September. Do you know how much is 50$ in stocks worth? Per stock?
That's 200 BILLION dollars Apple lost.
2539 2019-02-05 01:04:50 That’s why i said that day you know nothing about stocks and your statements keeps proving that i’m right
2540 2019-02-05 01:02:56 I wanna get into stocks... just need someone to teach and enlighten me on a few things. 
2541 2019-02-05 01:02:08 $VLUE had a return of 9.84% YTD, while $MTUM had a return of 6.46% and $SPY had a return of 8.06%.  Could this be the beginning of a mean-reversion of value stocks after a decade of underperformance?

2543 2019-02-05 01:00:09 RSUs are vastly different than options. RSUs are already real stocks. Options need to be purchased by the grantee then they become real.
2544 2019-02-05 00:59:56 Anybody use stocks to trade software? Looking for some opinions on it. Seriously considering it. Just looking to hear from ppl with experience.

2548 2019-02-05 00:58:30 Go ahead and say that to the mayor of New York or the governor. Remember your pension plans rely heavily on stocks and their rate of return.
2549 2019-02-05 00:58:09 Short for a trade is fine but bearish on these stocks??? One has to be a total fool
2550 2019-02-05 00:58:01 Probably a good chance of both. Lots of feminized stocks aren't stabilized for homogenous production while their practices may be stressing the plants making it more likely to happen.
2551 2019-02-05 00:57:59 Most pot stocks were up big early, they have earnings coming. I exited today the last of my shares.

2554 2019-02-05 00:56:19 Not gonna argue w strangers about it any longer but if your company made less than you thought yet u use what it made to buy back your own stocks' failing prices vs performance and expect all to be idiots to it a reckoning is dead ahead. #cashoutisgonnabetaxedworsethanuthink
2555 2019-02-05 00:54:57 Say the millionaires that made there money off the backs of taxpayers. If you own stocks please give your money back to the corporations so then can disperse it to the workers. Oh wait the laws are for others and not yourselves
2556 2019-02-05 00:54:02 So. No cheese, no lettuce & no tomatoes. Grab a ploughman's while stocks last.
2557 2019-02-05 00:53:55 Sheer talent.  Ask him to pick stocks for you and do the opposite of his suggestions.
2558 2019-02-05 00:52:39 Too subjective, Chuckles. They may be paying higher wages that you feel are insufficient. Buying back stocks is not a bad business decision.

2560 2019-02-05 00:51:53 I got the rest, thank you. I spwnd several hours and im getting good at spy and spx moves. Understanding how markets move along with some stocks. Reading several charts on different timeframes. What do u think of fibonacci levels? For profit taking ?
2561 2019-02-05 00:51:38 If I remember my corporate finance & accounting classes correctly, stocks are a liability similar to debt. The govt should NOT restrict a company from lowering their liabilities. This bill is ridiculous.
2562 2019-02-05 00:51:34 We've got a mixture of individual stocks and what are known as LIC in Australia (basically managed funds). Currently weighted more towards individual stocks, but we're slowly changing that. Don't have any EFTs yet (will eventually get some).
2563 2019-02-05 00:51:34 Anybody into stocks . Lookin for some new stocks to jump on. Been on  cannabis stocks lately. The only ones on the NYSE that are making some moves are Tilray, Canopy, Cronos group & Aurora.
2564 2019-02-05 00:51:12 Are you going to be giving up all your stocks
2565 2019-02-05 00:50:23 Then you ovbiously dont understand marginal or you would know theres still the same incentives. And working hard? you wont be a millionaire because that has nothing to do with it,  and the odds arealready stacked against you. the money is in stocks and property anyway
2566 2019-02-05 00:50:13 Not much room to write on twitter... That is why I said 'there are less risky investments'. Also ETFs can solve the individual stocks issue. I have my sons money in a ETF portfolio, they charge zero fees for children.
2567 2019-02-05 00:49:20 Many strong stocks and new leaders continue to make it very difficult for money on the sidelines to enter. This is a good time to review a few market adages that focus on buying strength, new highs, new all-time highs and to trade with the trend!

2575 2019-02-05 00:45:36 Actually, if people would divest from their 401ks  they could buy their own stocks and decide which businesses they wanted to help expand in exchange for a small percentage of the profits. The system has been corrupted by forced retirement savings accounts.
2576 2019-02-05 00:45:07 If Social Security wasn’t ripping 15% of everyone’s income from them, they’d be able to invest in stocks for their own retirement.  As it is, all that money goes to keep your Ponzi scheme going.
2577 2019-02-05 00:45:03 $CLX is an example of stocks that investors could sell naked put options. when stocks is put to them, they can sell covered calls...

2587 2019-02-05 00:38:36 ofc, but some things shouldn't be stocks and sales driven businesses. again, it's the system (fault).
but that part about 7/10 is a bit strange to say the least
if they wouldn't give it to their loves ones, then they shouldn't be giving it to anyone else - all that do no harm :)
2588 2019-02-05 00:38:33 Can we get a little look at your stocks over the last two years?
2589 2019-02-05 00:37:20 Most of them did not work hard to earn their wealth, they inherited it from their rich family and invested it into stocks and the like to turn massive profits. And heaven forbid they pay their fair share of that while the poor people pay a heaftier % towards taxes than they do.
2590 2019-02-05 00:37:15 Bernie and Chuck... I'm one of those who worked, saved and was able to invest in stocks.  I'm not a wealthy stock owner so if government regulation prohibits them from managing their companies for the best return, you are accountable.  Where is your money invested?
2591 2019-02-05 00:36:28 And unemployment keeps beating records. I don’t have the links on my but look at the stock market it always boosts on the days these things are announced and it’s not Republicans blindingly buying stocks because of a Trump tweet. (2/2)

2595 2019-02-05 00:33:52 How would either of you know anything about the everyday worker? Also, have you forgotten that any retirement everyday workers have is tied to stocks and corporate performance? Idiots.

2598 2019-02-05 00:31:03 US stocks rose on Monday, spurred higher by gains in the major tecnology names and hopes for progress in trade talks with China ahead of the White House's 1 March deadline.

Jealous Chuckie maybe we should audit your taxes and your assets to see how honist you reall are. 

Better yet maybe we should audit the wealth and assets of all senator's and congresspersons

2602 2019-02-05 00:27:25 Do u understand how stocks work?  Without stock ownership we would not have corporate employers. You are even dumber than u look.
2603 2019-02-05 00:27:16 @RBReich what if all the public stocks were used as a way to give people universal income? Just wondering about different approaches to things like that.

2619 2019-02-05 00:17:09 They are such smart people - US stocks are expensive they will make them a lot cheaper if they get power. Its a great idea if you ask me. Its a pity they don't have much of a public sense of humour.
2620 2019-02-05 00:15:50 >  Unlike national pension funds with future obligations to pay out  pensions, SWFs are a pool of money owned by the state and invested in  stocks and bonds.

investing in stocks & bonds isn't actually how it is different from pension funds though lol

We are slowly moving to a world where the choices of buying will be many, but the final purchase will be restricted to a few large names!
And that is not only for stocks but for every purchase
2624 2019-02-05 00:13:14 @SenSchumer What’s the matter Chuck, jealous you’re not in on the stocks that you’re talking about? What nerve you have.

2632 2019-02-05 00:05:03 Is it telling us that the is a large percentage if stocks moving up or a small percentage pulling it up. Will need to do some research. Thanks
2633 2019-02-05 00:04:10 So we should all be buying up aluminium stocks? I have reviewed ‘value management’ items in construction - using aluminium rather than copper in the low voltage cabling. It was rejected by the client.
