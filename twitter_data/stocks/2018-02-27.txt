10 2018-02-27 23:56:27 Dear diane

Please do the job and ban bump stocks, automatic weapons, gun clips over 10 rounds and age limits under 21. The next gun incident is all on the congress if this isn't fixed. Don't let the NRA control the situation.

15 2018-02-27 23:55:16 Bump stocks are so irrelevant & won’t solve anything so it’s just a meaningless compromise. Beyond that, just want a President who believes in the constitution & will stand firm to uphold the constitution. Trump has already proved otherwise with proposed DACA compromise. ???

Don’t become an involuntary investor by holding onto stocks whose price has fallen. -Jesse Livermore
38 2018-02-27 23:51:21 David, once again, this is bullshit. Trump knows his approach will only succeed in delaying ANYTHING done against bump stocks. Trump's way will delay this in courts for YEARS (which is the whole point).

41 2018-02-27 23:49:54 I just bought my first stocks.
42 2018-02-27 23:49:44 more like "BRING out THE STOCKS"
43 2018-02-27 23:49:39 Totally legal. Its a long barrel, currently there are is no way to make it fully automatic and no bump stocks available. It does hold about a thousand flames.....
44 2018-02-27 23:48:24 Company brother works for bought back their stocks from employees and no raise.
45 2018-02-27 23:48:01 To be fair, maybe Dakich got an internship for a trading firm.  Stocks, bonds, foreign currencies...and DJ was congratulating him.   Don't be quick to judge.  
46 2018-02-27 23:47:43 How about we discuss your finances instead of Andreas'? It's getting boring.

So tell us. What's your net worth. What's it divided into. What Crypto, stocks, bonds, real estate, and other holdings do you have?

What's your blood type, how many credit cards do you own?
47 2018-02-27 23:47:01 So people who plan to commit harm should have unlimited access to guns and bump stocks? What about rocket launchers or tanks?
48 2018-02-27 23:46:58 The NRA has allowed me to speak out against bump stocks Okay, I want to ban them. 

Now they will send me money for my 2020 campaign.

50 2018-02-27 23:46:04 Today, I sat down with my local congressmen to discuss gun control. The two us had in his office for 3 hours discussing this topic. He said that he will introduce a new bill prohibiting bump stocks!! The two of us are going to discuss the topic over lunch tomorrow! #goodday
51 2018-02-27 23:46:02 He won’t. He is only saying that because he knows the #CorruptGOP will never pass that into law. Likes send a “directive” to the ATF about bumpstocks when the have already filled they have no control over bump stocks. Just more of Trump wagging the dog! #BoycottNRA #GunReformNow
52 2018-02-27 23:45:30 @realDonaldTrump you touch gun rights u are George Hw Bush aka 1 term only.leave Bump stocks alone as no proof that cuck used them..ur loosing my SUPPORT
53 2018-02-27 23:45:29 It will help prevent further crime?  How many crimes were committed with bump stocks in this state the last 10 years Jay?   I'd be willing to bet you a large sum of money the answer is zero.
54 2018-02-27 23:45:24 My position,I don`t support banning bump-stocks I don`t support raising the age to 21.I don`t support giving ONE DAMN INCH TO COMMUNIST.
55 2018-02-27 23:45:23 Scarier times in what sense? That American children will be safer? I dont belive assult rifles and bump stocks falls under the "well regulated" guns as stated in the 2nd amendment of the Constitution, matey.
56 2018-02-27 23:45:22 Liberals should take what we give them if anything on gun control. They more they try and take take take the less we are going to give them. Wait, my fed ex just arrived with my case of bump stocks. BRB
57 2018-02-27 23:45:12 Don’t want MS13 gangs armed w/automatic machine guns converted from semi w/bump stocks
58 2018-02-27 23:45:08 Bump stocks and extended mags are not necessary and should be made  criminal, but taking away the AR 15 (or any other semi auto) is not a good  idea. :/
Long guns are the best to scare away mean people without actually  shooting.
More people die from hand guns than long guns.
59 2018-02-27 23:45:04 Jared Kushner, just like the stocks has been DOWNGRADED
60 2018-02-27 23:44:40 Can gun owners disobey future federal law to sell bump stocks? Can you sell a several hundred dollar soda or OJ with a “free gift” of a bump stock at gun stores?
61 2018-02-27 23:44:09 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo
62 2018-02-27 23:43:48 The real problem is congress lack of really enacting laws fast these laws should be enacting stringent background checks and eliminate bump stocks and placement of x seals military around primeters of schools but no those assholes in congress won’t act
63 2018-02-27 23:43:46 @BaronVonWolfhouse @Bob__Barker @meowmerz i didnt see anything today that said either stocks or gold miners were going to reverse.
64 2018-02-27 23:43:44 @realDonaldTrump DOJ Session and ATF can surely within Executive powers to ban Bump Stocks without getting Congress involved
65 2018-02-27 23:43:37 You already said that bump stocks should be banned--did you lie when you said that after L.V. massacre, or just change your mind?
66 2018-02-27 23:43:36 Gun control 101: Ban all assault weapons and bump stocks. Period. Start with that, pass it. #NoMoreShootings
67 2018-02-27 23:43:35 I read like 4 books last year about stocks and thought I was a pro trader haha

70 2018-02-27 23:42:39 You do realize that everyone who wants gun control supports the second amendment right? No one is asking for guns or the right to own guns to be taken away. Just regulation and banning of semi automatic weapons/magazines/bump stocks so yes he is bright
71 2018-02-27 23:41:14 wow um should I buy some puma stocks hahah
72 2018-02-27 23:40:02 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. #tradeforex #stocks
73 2018-02-27 23:40:01 Not to mention the second amendment and the constitution. But anyways that’s why a law abiding US CITIZEN should have access to any semi-automatic weapon they wish. Bump stocks and other modifications to shoot faster should be banned though.
74 2018-02-27 23:39:32 Yep, totally agree, but even Tolga's stocks can be subject to large retraces that offer cheaper entries. DRG, MEI, HEG, EUC, BLZ to name a few. Not saying that's going to happen here, but tightly held stocks can be impossible to exit from if interest evaporates.
75 2018-02-27 23:38:51 For those bump stocks still in circulation, they should have a police by back and be destroyed and new sales outlawed. Any bump stocks found during raids should be destroyed. I agree those items are unnecessary with no redeeming quality. 

I have others.
76 2018-02-27 23:38:20 William Landers, a money manager who oversees $2.2 billion at BlackRock, told Bloomberg that he entered the year with a 'pretty big overweight' in Brazil." He sees potential in the mining, oil and financial industries.  Brazil materials stocks have been by far the biggest gainers
77 2018-02-27 23:38:06 As a noob I appreciate these types of perspectives. When I traded penny stocks I used similar criteria when assessing an investment opportunity. 

Before realizing it was all a scam and I was going to get rekt during extended trading hours.
78 2018-02-27 23:37:51 President Trump has talked about support for improving background checks, and banning bump stocks.  I know many Republicans are open to discuss potential changes; better education even increasing age.  Need to work together not just hate and refuse to negotiate.

80 2018-02-27 23:37:29 when im trading stocks. i am always thinking of "What if I loss 50% in this trade".
81 2018-02-27 23:37:26 Seems to me law would have to be changed by Congress, not DOJ, since bump stocks don't fit def. of auto weapon. Where has this useful idiot J S been when needed on FISA crime. I wouldn't have cared if he didn't know what he was doing if he had just done something. Sewer RAT
82 2018-02-27 23:36:57 Washington State has just passed a ban of bump stocks, Oregon passes net neutrality! Go, west coast, go, lead the country in the right direction. Thank you to both governors Inslee and Brown!
83 2018-02-27 23:36:52 The new MJ Listing of CRON on Nasdaq was lackluster and the 56 MJ stocks I follow showed just 12 higher and 40 lower.  Have to believe that soon however, the entire sector will run up again as it's been hit quite hard recently, but just imho.
84 2018-02-27 23:36:19 Almost every veteran I’ve followed on Twitter says you’re wrong. It’s the civilian version of the M4 they carried in combat in war zones. Adding bump stocks seems to make it dire like a fully automatic. I know nothing of guns and I’d like to keep it that way. I’m quoting vets.
85 2018-02-27 23:35:41 the NRA has said this week that they are against raising the age of purchasers and they are against banning bump stocks. The NRA has been against anything that would eliminate gun violence and blamed LE instead. Its apparent that we dont have enough LE to combat this, so ban them
86 2018-02-27 23:35:24 Ew. Nonstop 1 minute matches with stocks ending at 30-50% 
87 2018-02-27 23:35:03 You sure looked like a bumbling idiot @ the governors meeting.  What the hell does tweeting have to do about keeping our children safe. You couldn't even agree with our president @POTUS @realDonaldTrump when he said he was going to ban bump stocks without approval of Congress.

91 2018-02-27 23:32:34 But then when you look at the stocks that survived the Dot Com bubble that bubble doesn't even look like a blip on their charts.
92 2018-02-27 23:32:22 As to bump stocks and raising by Trump and then changing: It's his typical con-job, the same way he got into office.
93 2018-02-27 23:32:04 Why do bump stocks gotta be so exspensive?
94 2018-02-27 23:31:58 I don't really trade the dividend stocks, Currently all exclusively in the RRSP. At some point I will be moving the ones that are 100% dividend eligible out of the RSP.
95 2018-02-27 23:31:18 Stocks. Don’t think they will do it this year but maybe next !!
96 2018-02-27 23:31:02 Getting closer to March crucial timing period now... no new trades for me ..not much left in trader folio (don’t care about the super stocks) this strength has been your best friend 
97 2018-02-27 23:29:49 BBC 3 iPlayer has 4 episodes of 4 weeks in Arkansas when the state planned to execute 8 men in a four week period because the drug stocks they had were going out of date. Horrendous. Some people so vehement in support of capital punishment hard to empathise with them
98 2018-02-27 23:29:48 Both are semi automatic but have wooden stocks so prolly not
99 2018-02-27 23:29:17 And growing employment. Minimal at best. Most of the money from the tax breaks is being invested in stocks.
100 2018-02-27 23:29:05 Trump thought he was talking about background checks and age limits for day traders; though “bump stocks” was a newfangled form of hedge. #tytlive
101 2018-02-27 23:29:00 Bump stocks to me are useless tool. But, Jeff Sessions just stated DOJ could ban to keep semi's from converting to full auto.
102 2018-02-27 23:28:55 I've now heard the phrase "stocks don't make a triple top" three times on CNBC: on $INTC, $SQ, and $LULU. Let's see if that statement plays out....
103 2018-02-27 23:28:48 Dam! I c you still on my dick smh  go back 2 ur stocks 
104 2018-02-27 23:28:07 Fedex stocks are up again..now what?
105 2018-02-27 23:27:49 Absolutely NONE of those accusations is true!  He has suggested tougher background checks, increased purchase age, outlaw bump stocks, he has tried to increase funding for the mentally ill via Congress and the idea to train and arm teachers came up after Columbine..not yesterday!
106 2018-02-27 23:27:32 So, was it  God's voice that told you to support the NRA no matter how outrageous their stand?  I'm pretty sure Jesus "turn the other cheek" Christ doesn't support assault rifles, bump stocks, and access to weapons at gun shows without a background check.
107 2018-02-27 23:27:14 Yes it is but this guy doesn't understand that criminals don't follow laws. Sarah said today in the news conference that Trump was still planning to ban bump stocks even though there are clear instructions on how to make one online.
108 2018-02-27 23:26:39 Stocks?  Bonds?  Foreign currencies?
109 2018-02-27 23:26:15 Bulk of tax reduction going into stock  buybacks and dividends benefiting the 10% of Americans who own 84% of stocks.The forward looking corps are investing in training and equipment. Ok things could have been great things if this tax bill had been done right. Massive deficit now
110 2018-02-27 23:26:12 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

118 2018-02-27 23:23:19 Yeah no talk about gun control that he was letting on... and he hasn’t in the recent past either!  It makes no sense to ban bump stocks.  They think an accessory that makes a gun an automatic should be banned but not an automatic gun at purchase. Help me here...
119 2018-02-27 23:22:21 The bump-stocks, “fostech” from Columbus Indiana. But my point is anytime we take away liberties someone loses. The solution to every problem isn’t more laws, today’s solution to problems is more laws and it scares me
120 2018-02-27 23:21:55 Apropos of nothing here, but.... why are ministers and prime ministers just allowed to resign when they have royally fucked up? Their ineptitude hurts millions and they just walk away. I think they should be judged by the people and the minimum penalty be the stocks!
121 2018-02-27 23:21:40 I’m not saying there shouldn’t be some reform. These guys want guns taken away. Should children who can’t even buy a beer buy a gun? No.
Should there be bump stocks? No. Should people with mental health issues get a gun? No. They want to take away guns across the board.
122 2018-02-27 23:21:12 We also support universal background checks for all firearms, raising purchase age to 21, safe storage, ban high volume magazines, bump stocks, assault weapons. But MOST importantly, the safest home for kids is one w/o a gun. The data is clear. Best not to have one at all.
123 2018-02-27 23:20:56 Thank you to the Senate led by @WASenDemocrats for concurring with amendments and sending the ban on bump stocks to the governor's desk! #bumpstocks #waleg
124 2018-02-27 23:20:56 The money has gone to INVESTORS, NOT CAPITAL INVESTMENT. That is the WHOLE POINT. They are NOT EXPANDING. They are BUYING BACK THE STOCKS
Many businesses are CLOSING now that they can AFFORD TO. 
Corp PROFITS were HIGHEST during the recession, they had laid off millions
125 2018-02-27 23:20:48 Ban bump stocks...? What's next to ban 3D printers, shop classes, welding, and a person's intuition? The enemy is way past the gate! The enemy is sitting down at the table eating lunch with your fellow Americans.
126 2018-02-27 23:20:41 Many treat companies and investing like a Nintendo game. Stock prices may go down because of rising rates but fundamentally, strong co's in the right market segments will overcome this speed bump. Recall Greek crisis. Italian crisis. End of QE? No one does. Stocks powered thru it

130 2018-02-27 23:20:09 I think it will be a very unpopular opinion that my @MissouriGOP primary opponent @HawleyMO is supporting executive orders banning rifle bump stocks. Is this what you really want in your future senator @MissouriGOP? #2AShallNotBeInfringed

131 2018-02-27 23:20:00 ...eventually rates keep rising & the USD falling & risk markets get spooked, selling off, at which point we see a most curious phenomenon:  The long end of UST curve sells off sharply WITH stocks, again puzzling US investors not familiar w/EM BoP dynamics (this just happened)...
132 2018-02-27 23:19:36 Trump is finished if he keeps proposing bans on bump-stocks.
FINISHED.
133 2018-02-27 23:18:15 This guy  could of put that in stocks/mutual Funds and accrued compounding interest at a conservative 7% a year  SMH
134 2018-02-27 23:17:58 their website says that about traditional stocks, cryptocurrency is sent to digital wallets with an specific address that i dont think you can limit what comes in and goes out in that encrypted currency
135 2018-02-27 23:17:14 I'm all for expanded background checks and mental health checks. I'm also for banning bump stocks.
136 2018-02-27 23:17:09 Then enact stricter gun laws to prevent another tragedy. Raise the minimum age to own, ban ARs, bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Close all the background check loopholes. It isn’t hard unless you have sold your soul to the NRA. #SendBackNRABloodMoney #GunReformNow
137 2018-02-27 23:17:08 @GOP @POTUS @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr Gun control 101: ban all assault weapons and bump stocks. Period. Start with that. Pass it. Nothing complicated.
138 2018-02-27 23:16:42 All stocks went up yesterday you dummy. This was actually one of the lower gains.
139 2018-02-27 23:16:34 Trumps not going to like his name being associated with penny stocks....sounds cheap....bad for the brand
140 2018-02-27 23:15:44 Respect to you Rep Schiff! Ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons, raise buying age to 21, limit magazine size and sales, waiting periods, no internet and gun show sales loopholes, no excuses. #NotOneMore #GunReformNow @SpeakerRyan @RepDarrenSoto @senmarcorubio  @ #NeverAgain
141 2018-02-27 23:15:10 NICE CHART  I LOVE  IT
142 2018-02-27 23:15:10 I agree with getting rid of bump stocks and the rest but as for the age raised to 21 i strongly disagree. I come from a family of hunters and it has been a sport enjoyed by people for centuries . You will be punishing young hunters that are responsible people.
143 2018-02-27 23:15:04 @TIAA I have a 401K account with TIAA-CREF. I would like to know which ones of your investment products contain (may contain, do not contain) stocks of weapon manufacturers. I do not wish to have my retirement funds invested in that industry. Is that list available? @nytimes
144 2018-02-27 23:14:58 They are gonna tie DACA to bump stocks and background checks...it's what they do
145 2018-02-27 23:14:30 Stocks go up and down all the time. Your point is, well, pointless. In other news, FedEx offers have been removed from the NRA website. I like them apples just fine. That crow you're eating is nasty though.
146 2018-02-27 23:14:05 I don’t work with stocks at all. I actually don’t work in my field per se (sales) but I like economic policy and I’d deal with commodities before stocks
147 2018-02-27 23:14:01 How about banning assault weapons, bump stocks, and closing loopholes with gun show sales and conducting more thorough background checks?  What’s hard about that? Oh, except your pimp @NRA would take your money away. #NeverAgainMSD
148 2018-02-27 23:13:53 Important bill, yes. What about the ban on assault weapons and bump stocks?
149 2018-02-27 23:13:07 Ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons, raise buying age to 21, limit magazine size and sales, waiting periods, no internet and gun show sales loopholes, no excuses. #NotOneMore #GunReformNow @RandPaul @SenatorCollins @senmarcorubio @SenBillNelson @SenateMajLdr #NeverAgain
150 2018-02-27 23:13:03 There is nothing wrong with gun owners.  The issue is lobby groups that represent a small % of the total population buying votes.  Warren can invest where he wants.  Investors can chose/chose not to invest with in stocks that work with gun mfrs.
151 2018-02-27 23:13:03 @dguaial they eat premium and buyback stocks at discount.. Buffet major source of income is this (master of premiums, insurance)
152 2018-02-27 23:12:38 Whatever you guys should check the economy, stocks, and most of all my precious paycheck !!
153 2018-02-27 23:12:20 Ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons, raise buying age to 21, limit magazine size/sales, waiting periods, no internet and gun show sales loopholes, no excuses. #NotOneMore #GunReformNow @RandPaul @SenatorCollins @SpeakerRyan @senmarcorubio @SenBillNelson @SenateMajLdr #NeverAgain
154 2018-02-27 23:12:13 I do. What’s your point? Parents should be cool with civilian access to semiautomatic weapons and bump stocks as long as their kids teacher is packing? People without kids don’t care about mass shootings?  That’s a ridiculous question.
155 2018-02-27 23:12:01 economics is interesting. so you work more with like stocks?
156 2018-02-27 23:11:42 @dguaial premium sellers r normally big guys.if price goes against them (ex: upside) they dump stocks and brings the price down.
157 2018-02-27 23:11:23 Let’s try this again with out auto correct mistakes from hell.  I’m all for banning ALL assault weapons as well as bump stocks.  I agree completely that we make it way to easy for people to buy weapons of mass destruction.
158 2018-02-27 23:10:52 If we banned the kinds of rifles that bump-stocks were designed to augment. 

We wouldn't have to worry about the damn bump-stocks at all.

Would we?
159 2018-02-27 23:10:35 Chicken...stocks. ENTENDRES
160 2018-02-27 23:09:48 Putting guns in schools is idiotic. It is time for comprehensive background checks and illumination of large capacity magazines, bump stocks etc that make theses weapons so lethal.
161 2018-02-27 23:09:42 This will not prevent any killings you idiot Governor. Criminals and crazies can get any kind of weapons or bump stocks they want underground on the streets. Get in reality fool.
162 2018-02-27 23:09:38 @SpeakerRyan You didn’t listen to the kids - you’re blocking laws and making more murders possible. #Parkland 
Get rid of assault weapons, pass UNIVERSAL background checks, ban bump stocks, deny gun purchase by anyone under 21.
163 2018-02-27 23:09:37 I think it's Pamela again with Cairo and Jack and family gone for Stocks homes and inheritance including mine in Russia thus the latest attack on them verbally
164 2018-02-27 23:09:28 Is it possible, recent sell-off from high of 26,616.71 on Jan. 26, is followed by recovery phase until 2nd sell-off occurs. Historically, 2nd wave selling can take stocks down very rapidly, more than 20%. If this analysis is correct, 2nd wave of selling is not far away. Will see?
165 2018-02-27 23:09:26 Real talk though? An "assault rifle" (how did this bill define that btw?) ban wouldn't stop what happened at that school from happening again. Plain looking rifles with wooden stocks kill just as readily as black rifles with accessory rails. Pointless.
166 2018-02-27 23:09:22 Less than 5% in stocks? You can have a diversified portfolio of stocks with minimal effort. The last 90 years of history are proven. Not giving investment advice because, as an Investment Adviser, I can't do that on social media. But it's something to think about.
167 2018-02-27 23:09:14 As long as I have your attention, you have a bigger microphone than I do.  Think about advocating that bump stocks be made class 3 devices.  This would make up for the 1986 ban on new full auto guns
168 2018-02-27 23:09:00 PRESIDENTISL IDEAS
•Strengthening background checks
•Banning Bump stocks
•Raising purchase age 4 some rifles to 21
• Arming teachers in schools.
169 2018-02-27 23:08:42 Yeah. And maybe make some investments in chicken stocks too, Ted.
170 2018-02-27 23:08:33 All stocks were down because the fed is increasing interest rates.
171 2018-02-27 23:08:01 biotechs full of surprises. how quickly wall street darling stocks goes to opposite end of spectrum.
172 2018-02-27 23:07:55 @ChuckGrassley @SenJoniErnst @RepRodBlum Support the ban on sale/use of bump stocks and expanded background checks. It is time to work for your constituents, not the NRA. #NeverAgain
173 2018-02-27 23:07:42 Mr.President, sir you have Louisiana's support, bump stocks aren't necessary, gun owners will support that issue, but Free Speech in the media platforms are being censored, can you look into the suppression of our First Amendment, we trust you on the 2nd Amendment, Thank you Sir
174 2018-02-27 23:07:36 And their stocks continue to rise. Thanks for the help Alyssa, bae-bee. #Backfire

176 2018-02-27 23:06:54 Glad to have #waleg pass a ban on bump stocks today. This is a modest, common sense piece of legislation that will help prevent further gun violence, though there's a lot more we can do this session.
177 2018-02-27 23:06:08 Is there a way to have a conversation about stocks and investments without sounding like a goddamn commercial? Smh
178 2018-02-27 23:05:36 Last I checked Senator all the PERS pensions in Oregon held stocks for each recipient. Federal workers have stocks, 401K's have stocks. Almost every American has some investments. So everyone benefits when the market is flush. #StopDemLies
#RemoveSenWyden
179 2018-02-27 23:05:27 To anyone in Congress now who says, "We don't need more gun laws", would you still say that if your kids or grandkids had been in Parkland? Ban assault weapons and bump stocks NOW. #NoMoreShootings
180 2018-02-27 23:03:49 Actually you are wrong about that assessment. A company buying back its own stock has excellent tax benefits, as well as it’s great for all shareholders.  And while not everyone holds individual stocks, most do have a 401k plan with some type of mutual funds.
181 2018-02-27 23:01:46 @realDonaldTrump you going to let the kids down sign bump stocks. Russia in our voting booth you know it’s over soon
182 2018-02-27 23:01:37 Good afternoon Mr. Titus unfortunately I’ve been listening to you for a long time and it is true that we cannot stop crazy Banning bump stocks and another thing you think may help but when you’re crazy and you should know this with your family history. Nothing will stop them
183 2018-02-27 23:01:35 Powell's mere reiteration of hawkish themes from recent Fed meeting minutes enough to rekindle rising rate fears. Bonds recoup most of early losses as stocks weakened.
184 2018-02-27 23:00:13 You have no clue what I do or do not understand. Bump stocks need to be banned as far as I am concerned.   However the AR itself (without a bump stock) is not an assault weapon.  It is a semi-auto rifle. Stop with the ad hom it spoils your credibility. Many guns use that round.
185 2018-02-27 23:00:05 Yawn. Sessions won't do squat. Too worried about pot and bump stocks. The things that really matter.
186 2018-02-27 22:59:51 Why you taking bump stocks, Mr. President?  We voted for a pro-2A President.  We got your back but you need to get ours.  Defend our gun rights, Mr. President.
187 2018-02-27 22:59:38 So that means the NRA no longer owns you and you are ready to support stricter gun laws and ban assault weapons and bump stocks? Or are still a spineless jellyfish under the control of the NRA?
Patiently waiting for your answer.

188 2018-02-27 22:59:10 Bill banning bump stocks heads to governor's desk after Senate concurs on House amendments. #waleg
189 2018-02-27 22:58:14 BREAKING: Washington's Legislature has approved a ban on bump stocks used to increase the rate of fire of semi-automatic rifles.  Bill goes to @GovInslee for consideration. #waleg
190 2018-02-27 22:58:05 With a 31-18 vote in the Senate, a ban on bump stocks has cleared the Washington Legislature. It now heads to @GovInslee. #waleg
191 2018-02-27 22:57:32 Bump stocks should be banned too, but if you can get a gun that only fires one round at a time and that's enough, what necessity is there to have a gun that can fire 600 rounds in under a minute other than war?
192 2018-02-27 22:57:16 just bought 10 penny stocks & dropped outta school iono how y’all do that 9-5 shit 
193 2018-02-27 22:57:04 So this is all really to benefit whatever big pharma is? Interesting and could be right Let's see what stocks media companies own
194 2018-02-27 22:56:48 Just finished a prospect meeting and have come to realize that the hardest folks to advise are QE #millionaires.

ie. folks who, by luck, got into stocks around '09 and blindly rode the market into 2018. They don't understand Fed manufactured markets of today. Powell will help.
195 2018-02-27 22:56:42 oh yeah. this isnt the end of pot stocks lol. just for now the money is gone in them.

will be another run. doubt like the last but never know.

and yeah. downslope continues on the charts on all the pot stocks. need to see that trading go horizontal before the blood bath stops
196 2018-02-27 22:56:40 @realDonaldTrump @mike76139 blocked me. It's the reason I say stock market will fall bc the idiot test usually works. Most Trumpers don't see the negative. The up was a setup for buyers/conservatives through Trump. It's why after Steve was called a dog, stocks started to fall.

Please kindly re-think your proposed ban on "bump-stocks"... LAW-ABIDING citizens should NOT lose ANY BIT of OUR RIGHTS bc of such BIZARRE incidents!!
218 2018-02-27 22:48:55 Backed off on banning bump stocks that turn AR15s into automatic killing machines? If he were listening, wouldn't he stop listening to the minority of 5 million Americans who are NRA sycophants and start listening to the majority, over 300 million who want an AR-15 ban? (2)

225 2018-02-27 22:45:16 After a rough February, stocks are entering what are often two of the best months of the year for the market.
226 2018-02-27 22:44:48 Meanwhile, no background checks, ever. Bump stocks that turn military assault rifles into machine guns. Massive ammo clips.  Your 80 year old English teacher will now be required to take down a heavily armed 19 year old with a death wish, from 50 ft... for a small cash bonus.

That is a promise!!!!
231 2018-02-27 22:42:59 What are you & House going to do to ban assault guns & bump stocks?  Talk is cheap
232 2018-02-27 22:42:51 That's why you gotta understand these kids have done more than the NRA in speaking out against mass shootings. That's why we crap on them for encouraging bump stocks, that's not speaking in favor of the people and general safety, just in favor of cash in gun manufacturers pockets
233 2018-02-27 22:42:38 You don’t get to take away everyones right, limits on bump stocks and high capacity magazines, fully automatic weapons, and stronger mental health screenings are needed. Not taking away somebody’s right to own a gun
234 2018-02-27 22:41:58 Need to get back on these stocks and investments as well
235 2018-02-27 22:41:47 Dont let them pull the wool over your eyes and convince you that banning bump stocks is #guncontrol bump stocks are not the issue, it's not enough.
236 2018-02-27 22:41:47 My President you don’t own all the Stock on tricks. And either you are trying to trick us or you are being tricked.Tricks are for kids. You back off the notion of banning bump stocks and do some research.or lose your entire base.. that’s my best advice my President..
237 2018-02-27 22:41:39 Did you even read the article?
1. It doesn't say what guns were used.
2. It stated there were modifidied stocks  (bump stocks).
3. Tell me what Obama did with bump stocks.
4. Again, this is about criminals and has nothing to do with my 2A rights.

240 2018-02-27 22:40:45 @WiltonSimpson What is your position on raising the age to buy a firearm and the banning of bump stocks?
241 2018-02-27 22:40:13 Don’t just listen. DO SOMETHING you sanctimonious hypocritical lying sack of shit. Ban assault rifles. Make background checks mandatory and as strict as car licenses. Make bump stocks illegal. Raise purchase age.
242 2018-02-27 22:40:09 This is just NRA speak.  No one should have AR-15, bump stocks or high capacity magazines on our streets.  It's time to represent us and keep us safe.  Stop siding with the NRA
243 2018-02-27 22:40:07 We've been saying this for a while and now there’s proof. The only reason why our company is staying afloat is because of Trumps tax plan. Instead of investing in employees they are taking that money for their stocks. #GOPTaxScam
244 2018-02-27 22:39:30 New Fed Chief moving markets today. Time to talk about the Powell power. US stocks down; 10 year US yield back above 2.9%; US dollar rallied. Fed may hike 4 times or more in 2018?

249 2018-02-27 22:39:02 But they do ship guns to purchasers. They do not have to agree, but they are a business. Businesses need to keep their political views separate. If not, they pay a price. United snd Delta stocks are already falling. Again not about discounts!

252 2018-02-27 22:35:35 Bump stocks are still available, but I made my point. We’ll see where this ends up before you know it. I’m sure we have plenty of other domestic terrorists out there. Giving teachers guns might solve all our problems.
253 2018-02-27 22:34:51 Yeah I trade my SMSF; stocks only, no leverage or currencies etc. I analyse fair value for every stock, based on its MC and revenue. That's my risk reward mechanism and process that keeps me in and out of trades. Serves me very well.
254 2018-02-27 22:34:42 Restrict AR ammo to 1500 FPS. Energy drops 78% and bump stocks stop working and yet the AR's will continue to function at the gun range while not being the first choice of killers.
255 2018-02-27 22:34:17 People at 18 are often living on their own, do they not deserve the right to defend themselves?

"Stupid weapons." Automatic weapons are illegal, bump stocks are getting regulated, and everything else is reasonable.

262 2018-02-27 22:33:44 I didn't see anything 2 support assault rifles! You're the MORON. Bc all we want 2 do is ban assault rifles & bump stocks & large magazines.  We aren't looking 2 take away ur 9 mil, 357s or your hunting rifles. If u need an assault rifle 4 hunting I suggest more target practice.
263 2018-02-27 22:33:15 I am embracing survivors of a school shootings. I'm embracing the desire to change gun laws. I'm embracing banning bump stocks, embracing extensive background checks for every firearm sale, embracing raising the age & most of all, encouraging young people to be politically active
264 2018-02-27 22:32:34 So even the federal courts say the 2nd Amendment doesn’t extend to “weapons of war”. Tell me dumb asses, which military arms their soldiers with semi-automatic AR-15’s, AK’s or others with or without bump stocks? Not a DAMN ONE! Wake up MR. President! We aren’t the enemy!
265 2018-02-27 22:32:29 my idea for jeff bezos is that he is secured by some type of stocks wherein an angled blade is positioned above his head and then the blade falls and his head falls into a basket below
266 2018-02-27 22:31:27 over three million to an state senator to ignore 
bump stocks or  assault style rifles courtesy 
the NRA  his response “they buy into his agenda “
lol sir your head is in the sand . part of the problem
267 2018-02-27 22:30:45 In a non argumentative, debating way, I somewhat agree. I think an AR shoots .223(?) As far as I know you can’t hunt big game with it. And clips of 30 and 50 rounds aren’t needed. Ban bump stocks too. IMO. Not meaning to argue.
268 2018-02-27 22:30:45 @GovGoneWild What is your position on raising the age to buy a firearm and the banning of bump stocks?
269 2018-02-27 22:30:34 Only yes for me is 7. I really don’t care about bump stocks. There a novelty at best, banning or keeping wouldn’t effect much.
270 2018-02-27 22:30:22 Talk weed stocks my man!
271 2018-02-27 22:29:48 Lot of dotcom stocks looked like a good value a few months after prices declined starting in March 2000. A bargain at 50% off the high. And then some were a bargain at 90 or 99% off the high. If you lived through that, you know new tech is always being supplanted by even newer.
272 2018-02-27 22:29:30 Stocks up today!! Haha

276 2018-02-27 22:28:03 they will thankfully convince Trump to set regulations and ban bump stocks --they will by no means ever convince Trump nor anyone to abolish the 2nd amendment or ban the NRA
277 2018-02-27 22:26:24 A gal in office listed some Stocks she owned on her SF86 and had to deal with the Gov lawyers for six months to straighten the issue out
278 2018-02-27 22:26:17 So, Senator Feinstein, you are in Congress ( at least now), so introduce a law to outlaw bump stocks.
279 2018-02-27 22:26:13 @SenJohnKennedy Until we solve the "idiot" problem, let's ban assault weapons and bump stocks. There is no valid use for them in society, nor should they be protected.#NoMoreShootings
280 2018-02-27 22:25:56 As Dwight K Schrute said: bring back the stocks
281 2018-02-27 22:25:51 @permabear_uk Wanted to get your thoughts on which sectors and/or stocks you believe will be driving the market to 3047? FANG is getting awfully rich in valuation and their presence in the SPY & QQQ is what added 30+% to the S&P in the last 2 years.
282 2018-02-27 22:25:42 Columbine happened during an assault rifle ban. And hate to tell ya, but bump stocks can be homemade in 30 minutes. You can't ban them.
283 2018-02-27 22:25:39 The President is going after bump stocks.The kid had an AR15. He bought it legally at 18. Bump stocks ban is good but not enough. You guys will go back to school, they hope ya’ll will forget. NRA is on full attack. Don’t let up! #TrumpMustActOnAR15 #BanAssaultRifles #NeverAgain
284 2018-02-27 22:25:21 Ah sure time to get stocks in hi yellow metallic paint.. we'll all be rich.. cars will also have to be the same colour to be visible right?
285 2018-02-27 22:24:36 I recommend stocks, mutual funds or bonds than bitcoin. They have low risk and the return of investment is good especially when it reaches its maturity and you are investing for long term. :)
286 2018-02-27 22:23:59 Very likely true. Straight from DTC playbook with stocks
287 2018-02-27 22:23:46 Looking forward to Britain bringing back the stocks, as it seized its own destiny.

291 2018-02-27 22:20:36 NOW DO SOMETHING VS BICKERING ABOUT IT!  ban assault rifles ban bump stocks change the age for ownership to 21 institute background checks. #neveragain #kidslivesmatter #BanAssaultRifles #ParklandStrong
292 2018-02-27 22:20:34 Hello! Well it takes some getting use to it, but there are functionalities that are nice, like having access to Level II trading, included by default for stocks which is really cool to have! Though the total balance on the account doesn't update in real time...
293 2018-02-27 22:20:22 Like these people own their stocks
294 2018-02-27 22:19:55 So for the sake of getting out of this pointless thread.  2A isn't going anywhere.  Better background checks, the age limit, and most likely bump stocks ban will happen.  It won't be unconstitutional. And no civil war.  I know that is a buzzkill but that's just how it is.
295 2018-02-27 22:19:39 @jimcramer I'm a recent AAP member and watched your video Daily Rundown today.  Thanks for helping me make money with stocks.  You wear your heart on you sleeve and your enthusiasm & love of your work comes through in your advice.

302 2018-02-27 22:17:56 I don't pay much attn to bond market. I should tho. Normal activity is stocks up,bonds down & vice versa. Seems like stocks & bonds have been tracking each other. Market looks like it may be settling in more reasonable way
303 2018-02-27 22:17:50 #Parkland #ParklandStrong Those that work for PEACE will be known as Children of God. Don't let up!  #MarchForOurLives #WashingtonDC no automatic weapons, bump stocks & expanded magazines.
304 2018-02-27 22:17:26 Umm, fully automatic weapons are banned, hence the drive to ban bump stocks, it's a way to get around it and make your rifle an automatic. Slight difference of wording, makes a huge difference. #FactsMatter
305 2018-02-27 22:17:16 We have to invest in votes to ban assault type weapons, high capacity ammo clips, and “bump stocks”.  The politicians and special interests groups are killing our future (children). When some of our citizens, would rather put a sticker, discount, and duffel bag ahead human life.
306 2018-02-27 22:16:39 Focus on the ammunition and not the weapon. Restrict AR ammo to 1500 FPS and the energy drops 78% and bump stocks stop working.
307 2018-02-27 22:16:39 He did say he would ban bump stocks that is true. Those are trash and being used as a scapegoat.  Something to sacrifice at the altar of political correctness.  I honestly don’t think they should be banned either. Guns and accessories aren’t the problem. @NRA @POTUS
308 2018-02-27 22:16:21 Not at all...

Having stocks for the long run is a good approach for most folks. 

I'm a trader, have been for 30 years and manage my account in the manner I do. Not suggesting it is for everyone. In fact, I would suggest it is not.
309 2018-02-27 22:14:01 Shareholders sell your stocks!!
310 2018-02-27 22:13:09 That's the propaganda you've been sold and u CLEARLY fell 4 it hook line and sinker... nobody is attacking the 2nd amendment dude.. but who REALISTICALLY needs AR 15 with bump stocks unless u r in a war?
311 2018-02-27 22:10:40 I trade Forex, commodities, and stock indexes...individual stocks I don't trade directly
312 2018-02-27 22:09:31 Trump has come out in favor of better back ground checks, raising the minimum age to purchase rifles as well as banning bump stocks.
313 2018-02-27 22:09:27 Crude stocks continue to run counter to seasonal trend, as OPEC+ maintains commitment to cuts, and PdVSA is about to face further sanctions, add a dash of ME strife, and you have obvious reasons for a sell off in crude...lol! #OOTT So, who's right on future global crude stocks?
314 2018-02-27 22:09:13 U got any holdings in any stocks or just commentating?
315 2018-02-27 22:08:02 But guns are not a passion for me. They are to you and we will keep debating and still get along. Raise the age limit to 21, do away with bump stocks and work on controlling the mentally ill on getting guns and I will be happy. Plus parents teach their kids respect and manners.

321 2018-02-27 22:06:18 At this age im honestly so confused. I have friends who have perfect 4.0’s while others are dropping out. I’ve got friends who are flipping enough stocks to buy sport cars while others strugle to put food in their mouth.
322 2018-02-27 22:06:16 similar..and with bump stocks, very similar
323 2018-02-27 22:06:12 So, we should get rid of bump stocks that changes guns into machine guns, but not ban manufactured machine guns?! Whaaaaaaat??
324 2018-02-27 22:05:42 Anyone, me incl'd that make predictions has a fool for a friend. CB juggle too many balls in air & unicorn stocks give false sense of ctrl.
325 2018-02-27 22:05:28 100 years ago we were willing to make Booze illegal (which was stupid). I think think we should try it with Assault Weapons, high capacity mags, bump stocks, and have an min age of 21. If it doesn't work, we can then try something else.

353 2018-02-27 22:00:06 Now that’s not true..

Trump said he will ban bump stocks himself if congress does not act. “Pen & Phine”

He stated he wants to raise the age to buy a long gun to 21. 

I belive in taking people at there word.  
If you say you want/will do something I Believe you.
354 2018-02-27 21:59:36 Yet another day of stocks getting hit hard, as the PREVIOUS safe haven Precious Metals are slammed, and the CURRENT and FUTURE safe haven, #Bitcoin, surging.
355 2018-02-27 21:58:38 What action do you plan to propose or endorse to help avoid this happening again? Read the autopsy reports of a victim shot by an assault rifle. The damage to a body is unimaginable. The ban must be reinstated, along with a ban on high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
356 2018-02-27 21:58:06 Guys 
357 2018-02-27 21:58:04 This is also the person who gave away bump stocks in a raffle.
358 2018-02-27 21:57:40 The top five stocks that fell today were $AZO. $CMCSA. $PRGO, $ORLY, and $SBAC.
359 2018-02-27 21:56:52 I also like to use days like today to look for stocks that were not as down as much as the market like $SQ $BA $ibkr $wday $AAPL $cnx $NOW $CRM $RHT $csco $xpo $INTC $mu
360 2018-02-27 21:56:52 The top five stocks that gained today were $AES, $DISCK ( $DISCA ), $M, $MCHP, and $CMG.

362 2018-02-27 21:55:50 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $BAC, $CMCSA, $AMD, and $M.
363 2018-02-27 21:55:31 The biggest problem with Leading Indicators is that they indicate very little about the actual economy because the two primary components are the S&P 500 and Yield Spreads.  Stocks are a lagging indicator when you look at economic revisions and yields are manipulated by the Fed.
364 2018-02-27 21:54:56 I use tradestation. In the futures markets there are no problems going long or short. If you want to short low float stocks then @CenterPointSec has some of the best borrows but it will cost you a lot. I’m probably not the best to ask.

7. Profit
373 2018-02-27 21:50:06 The financial media blamed the stock market correction on the increasing 10 year bond yield, but yields and stocks are often correlated.
374 2018-02-27 21:49:15 There the left go again shooting themselves in the foot.  (Pun intended) I'm OK with background checks, banning bump stocks etc. BUT Semi auto pistols I'll bet represent approx. 100-150 Million guns that would be BANNED under the bill. So the Dems really want guns outlawed.
375 2018-02-27 21:49:07 The total margin debt in US has reached 650 billion it was 300 billion before 2008 financial crisis. In other words 650 billion worth of stocks r bought on borrowed $. #NASDAQ #NYSE #FederalReserve
376 2018-02-27 21:48:41 The cool thing is that you can do whats called limit buys and sales. So you can say "buy x amount of share only when it hits $X.xx" so you dont Have to watch all day. I look at the stocks I'm invested in a lot though. Partially to try to study how the market goes up and down.
377 2018-02-27 21:48:32 Too late everyone on the other side is already reupping with these strong companies! #BoycottBackfire Stocks of Delta and Enterprise are TANKING! HAHAHAHHA
378 2018-02-27 21:48:14 Unless you expect to shoot and kill people, bump stocks, full auto and larger capacity magazines are just not necessary for anyone! However, I do plan to purchase an AR15 before some crazy bastard restrict their sales!!
379 2018-02-27 21:48:00 Americans are demanding action from Congress on gun violence. We must answer that call. Here’s where we start:
 
Make background checks universal & ensure data is getting into the system
Ban military-style assault weapons
Ban bump stocks
Raise the minimum age to purchase rifles
380 2018-02-27 21:46:58 Hoping @zazzle stocks up on there computer mouses again it's been months & I want to buy some of theirs.
381 2018-02-27 21:46:44 Hmmm - maybe stocks the one im never interested in 
382 2018-02-27 21:46:05 Pretty positive our founding fathers never pictured Americans generating assault rifles and trying to claim they’re safe when they generated the 2nd amendment. What logical reason is there that a civilian should own a semi-auto or assault rifle or bump stocks? There isn’t one.
383 2018-02-27 21:45:48 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to improve your bipolar disorder
384 2018-02-27 21:44:37 So much for being in favor of even banning bump stocks. #FucktheNRA
385 2018-02-27 21:44:11 You'd be surprised how many democrats own shares in gun manufacturer stocks. Every time they propose a gun ban the stocks dramstically increase in value.
386 2018-02-27 21:43:40 Stocks are looking great right on Wall street

391 2018-02-27 21:42:15 The sad realisation that stating “I never use Snapchat anymore” would increase its value rather than tank it’s stocks! (I actually don’t, you can thank me later Snap!)

398 2018-02-27 21:38:03 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT
THE BAN REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD 2 CIVILIANS. THE ORIGINAL INVENTOR NOT OTHER THAN MILITARY
IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH
EVEN 1 LIFE? 
CHILD OR ADULT?
THEIR SMILE, LAUGHTER, LOVE FAMILY, FRIENDS!!!
IS IT???
399 2018-02-27 21:37:45 Okay, would banning bump stocks have prevented the Las Vegas shooting?
The perp had enough guns, ammo and lead-time that the fact he was bump-firing is almost (but, admittedly, not completely) irrelevant.

Also, there are devices like gat-cranks that can achieve the same effect.
400 2018-02-27 21:37:31 Sure, I mean you could divest of an entire fund that owns a portion of Fed Ex, but then you'd be divesting of every other position in that fund. Unless you have a 401k that allows you to invest in individual stocks, which most 401ks don't do.

How about we ban liberals?
404 2018-02-27 21:35:13 They’ve not done A N Y T H I N G ! Vladimir Dotard said a few days ago he would ban bump stocks himself. MSM isn’t holding him 2 his own statement, & he’s done N O T H I N G !! We’ve heard lip service with no action behind their lies. T H E Y D O N O T C A R E . All bought by NRA
405 2018-02-27 21:35:03 Ban bump stocks and ar15. As a CCDW carrier these are not needed.
406 2018-02-27 21:34:31 Generally, herbivorous fish are less resource-intensive since you don't have to feed them fish meal, which puts pressure on wild fish stocks.

410 2018-02-27 21:33:45 You are missing a key factor. Rampant corruption both legal and illegal. The supreme court decision allowing unlimited contributions to political campaigns second perhaps only to money printing as a force pushing stocks hugely higher.
411 2018-02-27 21:33:41 Who is reading the Daily Brief? DT has a limited attention span? He ordered new jets, hired an election advisor, waffled on “bump stocks”, min age to buy AR 15’s is gone, Russian cyber war is not on the table, DACA is not resolved, teachers are in strike, etc. Etc.

423 2018-02-27 21:26:49 Maybe you don't understand how stocks work?  When you buy at 218 thats still a gain.  It fluctuates daily,
424 2018-02-27 21:26:16 @realDonaldTrump I didn't vote for you, but was starting to think you were really starting to do something here. I am against the bump stocks hell yes I am. I was raised in a household of guns with my dad and brothers being hunters. These need to go.
425 2018-02-27 21:26:11 There are many common sense gun laws but when the like making every sale and transfer have a background check. Eliminate high capacity guns, certain types of rifle, numb stocks. Make new guns come with biometric safety features
426 2018-02-27 21:25:36 The fact he had one of those stupid bump stocks probably caused him to miss more than if he were to take the time to aim. Any gun in the hands of evil is capable of 17 kills. We’ve been lucky that all these shooters have been amateurs
427 2018-02-27 21:25:16 Apparently they're still operating at a loss, or very thin margins. Without revenue, growth, ad pricing metrics public... its value is anybody's guess. Problems with these dual class stocks is only the regulators can force disclosure. Common shareholders have zero say.
428 2018-02-27 21:23:26 Stocks are purchased to gain returns, having your money to work for you, the greater the value of stocks, the greater the returns, no-one in their right mind is going to sell their stocks on the say so of a chump who does not understand the market, really is reaching.

438 2018-02-27 21:20:09 @MassGovernor Charlie, what are we doing on ERPOs + "red flag" laws. Gov. of Ri just signed one. Do you support H3081? We banned bump stocks + we did it fast. Now we need to stop school shooters from getting their hands on assault weapons. No more talk; I'm looking 4 leadership.

444 2018-02-27 21:17:35 IN NO WAY do I want gun rights taken away!!  ITS STUPID ANYONE THINKS IT COULD!!  But to not see point about assault rifles & bump stocks is just VERY stupid!
445 2018-02-27 21:17:34 Good news! Stocks are very expensive, so Powell is doing a good job tempering expectacions of further increases.
446 2018-02-27 21:17:16 Iron Lion I see a ton of premarket talk. Is there a way to buy shares premarket? It seems like soon as the market opens the penny stocks go south for shorting.
447 2018-02-27 21:16:19 If Bump-stocks that turn a rifle into a machine gun are banned then, Assault rifles should be banned, too !

To help you out, an AR 15 is a Semi -Auto  fire rifle,  it fires every time the trigger  is pulled. It can have a 30 rd magazine. All Auto Fire or Machine gun weapons were banned & not sold. Bump stocks modify the AR 15  to resemble auto fire.

495 2018-02-27 20:57:35 Looks like all shipping stocks are down! DHL is doing better. UPS is slightly less than FedEx. Nothing really exciting is happening! Even the airlines are down.
496 2018-02-27 20:57:35 Not sure what that has to do with parkland. But ok, anyone with some springs and a saw can fashion one of those bump stocks fairly easy
497 2018-02-27 20:57:30 We don't want a long drawn out legal battle to ban bump stocks, Jeff Sessions.
 We want legislation passed now. #BanAssaultWeapons #BanBumpStocks
498 2018-02-27 20:57:22 Can’t wait for the quotes on stocks being the only thing people won’t buy when they’re “on sale”.
499 2018-02-27 20:57:02 The Stock Market ($QQQ, $SPY, $DIA) is technically setup for a downward trend. I will recommend CASH position. If you know how to SHORT stocks, then short the market.
500 2018-02-27 20:56:51 Why no one can be as Warren Buffet in investing style !!! Because we just have to much data and report available and he Don't even sit next to computer to analyse the company #WarrenBuffet #investing #Billionaires #Bulls #stocks #shares
501 2018-02-27 20:56:40 You might be right. The only thing he's mentioned of changing recently, other than the absurdity of arming teachers in the classroom, is to maybe ban bump stocks. This is at best, a token change.
502 2018-02-27 20:56:25 What if it doesn't invest on stocks, what else can it invest?)) But If I was the director of that fund, I would buy mining companies from Africa like China.
503 2018-02-27 20:55:51 They certainly do. Mojo is the life blood and right now those who support the NRA are hexed off to bad Dow Land to never return again! Fed Ex is standing strong. It will take pain at the bottom line. No morals for the Children! #neveragain #stocks #NRA #BoycottNRA #BoycottFedEx
504 2018-02-27 20:55:48 So Gartdude said he was moderately long equities, right? 
Never underestimate the man.
Never.

505 2018-02-27 20:55:48 Chinese made a massive cash run. Guess what, stocks are just another place to “store your cash” like a shell game, your money is typically all what other people want. and your land or home. or your look of horror or something be fearless and attack a shooter.
506 2018-02-27 20:55:38 @JimmyKimmelLive Jimmy; an idea about the Las Vegas shooting.

507 2018-02-27 20:55:30 Barring a monster up day tomorrow for US stocks, we're gonna end our record up months in a row streak at 15...

Sad!
508 2018-02-27 20:54:39 Stocks are going out at the lows.
509 2018-02-27 20:54:28 Pour être honnête, j'ai déjà les 3 formats en stocks (avec quelques retouches nécessaires pour la novella), mais chut, c'est un secret.
510 2018-02-27 20:54:01 No time to jump ship. He is outwitting them. Trust Trump until you know you can’t. I’m an avid 2nd amendment person but who cares about bump stocks really? Now the age 21 thing...only if military gets age waiver.
511 2018-02-27 20:53:56 Yes you can, buy some stocks! haha
512 2018-02-27 20:53:49 Must have sold his stocks in bump stock.
513 2018-02-27 20:53:46 Will the nonprofits be able to cash them out like they do when stocks are given to them?
514 2018-02-27 20:53:43 Fair. But, it's interesting that the majority stakeholder $HMNY, a data company, just recently increased their ownership to 78%. In the meantime, theater stocks have all the upside without any of the exposure.
515 2018-02-27 20:53:37 We had a similar scare about a week ago where following the selloff the market reversed sharply higher the next day and previously we rallied overnight and recovered a good bit of ground, something I would not rule out recurring
There is really no serious breakdown in stocks yet
516 2018-02-27 20:53:34 I don’t understand the mass buying of food so far in advance. Like the bread will be stale and who really stocks up on fruit and veg #beastfromtheast
517 2018-02-27 20:53:07 What if you listened to the ideas Trump put before Congress to make mental health checks part of NICS and ban the sale of bump stocks?
What if you supported helping protect kids TODAY? What if you understood, & encouraged current gun laws? What if you stopped opposing the 2nd?
518 2018-02-27 20:52:34 If applicable: Folks should check with the company’s managing their retirement funds and 401k plans to make sure there are no investments in gun stocks #NeverAgain #MarchForOurLives
519 2018-02-27 20:52:30 where do things stand on banning assault rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks?  Keep your eyes on the ball. #GunLawsNOW #turncongressblue2018 #onetermtrump #BetoForTexas
520 2018-02-27 20:52:16 Ok so I didn’t put the “p” in the term...get your pillow out! So you never addressed my point, do AR-15’s fire 30rounds a minute w bump stocks and 30 round mags with 1 pull of the trigger? YES OR NO? If u say no, defend that with FACTS!!!
521 2018-02-27 20:52:02 Hey there, our 70% off sale is whilst stocks last!
#NLSam
522 2018-02-27 20:51:54 Technically, it’s not their money, it’s shareholders money. And it’s not great, it’s a bet; it pays off if stocks keep rising, but not if they’re buying at a peak high. Majority of Americans do own stock through their retirement vehicles.
523 2018-02-27 20:51:42 Stocks decline as Powell's comments fuel rate worries.
524 2018-02-27 20:51:08 Cannabis stocks got shorted to hell lmao.
525 2018-02-27 20:51:02 Signing off for the day. Stocks finally realizing that the Powell may be serious about 4 rate hikes this year? Don't fight the Fed. Hasn't someone said that once or twice (or a zillion times) before? Good night.
526 2018-02-27 20:50:48 Ban the kill stocks!
527 2018-02-27 20:50:28 We need to ban murder stocks! 
528 2018-02-27 20:49:28 Hanging out with my dad- he walks in and says "Not to talk about stocks, but.." And then talks about stocks.
529 2018-02-27 20:48:46 We have to make strengthening and additional oversight of gun regulating bodies part of the solution. Bump stocks should have been regulated out. We've seen NICS fail too many times. We know the arms black market continues to thrive. 

Universal background checks are imperative!

531 2018-02-27 20:48:09 Funny how no one was demanding that Obama needed to ban bump stocks
532 2018-02-27 20:48:04 How about every 1 buy Bump stocks & any thing Trump & NRA want 2 Ban from WE the people
533 2018-02-27 20:47:57 Real bad math , what’s worse is he tried to push some bs on bump stocks turning semis to autos. Why does it matter if we still legally sell autos?
534 2018-02-27 20:47:53 But there's also the reward for supporting the brands you love (dividend stocks)
535 2018-02-27 20:47:31 Virtus Health $VRT downgraded to Outperform from Buy on share price rally, price target lifts to $6.40 from $6.20 #ausbiz #XJO #equities #stocks #investing
536 2018-02-27 20:47:27 Love the idea of "unloved" stocks. There's one I'm eyeing that no one is talking about. Maybe it's a sign. I mostly pay attention to retail stocks.
537 2018-02-27 20:47:12 Bump Stock ban is a Band-Aid to the problem, a distraction from the real issue. Ban the Assault Weapons they go on, and the Bump Stocks will ban themselves.
538 2018-02-27 20:47:12 i sized to have staying power. we are probably in the last phase of a bull which often coincides with some sort of mania in the leaders (FANG etc) as there is enough money chasing concept stocks tsla can easily go up more but i bet it will ultimately fail. position sizing is key!
539 2018-02-27 20:46:59 How about skip the stupid stocks and ban ar's altogether! DUH! Seems like common sense especially after all the kids DYING!
540 2018-02-27 20:46:52 WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Tuesday the Justice Department will be ready soon to announce a decision on bump stocks, and hinted that the department’s lawyers believe the device can be banned through new regulations.
541 2018-02-27 20:46:10 Stick to the legit ones : $BYOC and $SGDH. Two best stocks in the OTC period. 
542 2018-02-27 20:46:03 You know perfectly well that with bump stocks still legal you can make it an automatic weapon
What do almost All of the mass shootings have in common?
Oh yeah, assault weapons

544 2018-02-27 20:45:37 Exactly,
And i can say that for fiat tooo.
U invest in shit penny stocks in share market and u loose,
And u buy drugs from local drug dealer using fiat,
Like fiat is never used to do terrorist funding. 
So we should ban fiat too?
545 2018-02-27 20:45:23 @TheDomino stocks down...bonds down...metals down...cash up.

550 2018-02-27 20:45:07 He asked a direct question and I answered it directly. The last Vegas shooter used a bump stocks to help increase his impact.
551 2018-02-27 20:44:57 @SenatorHeitkamp do the right thing on behalf of all the students in school that should be protected/feel protected. AR-15’s are weapons of mass destruction.Bump stocks/assault rifles have no place in our society.Waiting periods, raising the age to 21, background checks.
552 2018-02-27 20:44:49 You should have learned by now. Stay out of politics and keep your business. @Delta will be out of business in six months or so. The little cry babies don’t work and can’t afford to fly or buy stocks. Aloha, silly.
553 2018-02-27 20:43:53 Democrats are trying to keep bump stocks off our streets, while Republicans are trying to put guns in schools. We need to elect more Democrats in 2018. #mepolitics @MaineDems
554 2018-02-27 20:43:42 Prior to the Parkland Massacre, Florida officials are now debating new gun control laws. These include banning bump stocks amongst other things.
555 2018-02-27 20:43:27 The industry is fine and many of the companies are well run and have a solid future.  I personally held stock in a couple of them for a year and sold at a huge profit. They became cult stocks and were horribly overpriced. Still are.
556 2018-02-27 20:43:00 What's wrong with reasonable gun laws? Age requirements. registrations, Insurance programs, the only ban they're asking for is bump stocks. Mental health checks.
557 2018-02-27 20:42:57 Ainsworth Gaming $AGI result beat expectations, though all divisions saw Ebit declines YoY, but guidance disappointed. CLSA downgrades to Sell from Underperform, price target $2.05 #ausbiz #XJO #investing #stocks #equities
558 2018-02-27 20:42:19 @standardnews So the slight drop in temperature, and adverse weather, has prevented supermarkets being able to fully restock shelves. 
Therefore the low stocks sell out quickly. 
Hardly “UK in panic buying pandemonium shocker!”, is it?
559 2018-02-27 20:42:18 The next generation seems to be campaigning for a total ban on firearms, if useless crap like bump stocks keep becoming an issue then they might just get their way.
Cutting away these infamous extras directly serves to protect and strengthen the 2nd amendment, not weaken it.
560 2018-02-27 20:42:15 @AMarch4OurLives FL Senate Appropriations committee just voted *no* on 4 amendments of various kinds for gun control, including a ban on the sale of bump stocks. #VoteThemOut
561 2018-02-27 20:41:38 I don't hate any stock. I hate the people behind some of the stocks. I am a buyer of any stock under the right conditions. I've been in $SX plenty of times for trades over the last few months. If you know their games, it's easy to play the stock.
562 2018-02-27 20:41:17 Studies on Wallstreet have shown that when the C&H Sugar Stocks dropped that the Tooth Fairy Stocks rise.
563 2018-02-27 20:41:12 Bills to ban bump stocks and allow the arming of school staff do not get past Legislative Council with 5-5 party-line votes. #mepolitics
564 2018-02-27 20:40:56 Which penny stocks so, i only hearing about ETF’s
565 2018-02-27 20:40:50 It is my belief that bump stocks are the product of regulation. Manufacturers wanted a collapsable stock but had to make a trigger guard to make it legal. Someone somewhere figured out how to misuse it. Bump stocks weren't invent they evolved. My opinion.
566 2018-02-27 20:40:40 Bump stocks are not the problem.   The 2nd amendment is.
567 2018-02-27 20:40:20 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
568 2018-02-27 20:40:10 Who needs bump stocks anyway? The only time I would want one would be if I had to raid the damn White House! But it’s OK for the Republicans to stand behind bigots, misogynists and sexual predators because there are your people. It’s no fun when the rabbit has the gun is it?
569 2018-02-27 20:39:14 stocks wont stop going down until rates stop going up

we've reached the edge
570 2018-02-27 20:38:54 The AR15 is being called out because it is the weapon of choice for mass murder. But, yes, to your point, we should ban ALL semi-automatic rifles and guns, along with high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. #2A #GunReformNOW
571 2018-02-27 20:38:49 Amendment to ban bump stocks FAILS before the Florida Senate Appropriations Committee #FloridaSenate
572 2018-02-27 20:38:13 Ok, so you’re saying with bum stocks and 30 round mags it isn’t 1 trigger pull of rapid succession 30 rounds? I’m seen what the accessories make these rifles into in person; u mean my eyes deceived me?All the accessories and mags should be banned w the rifles.
573 2018-02-27 20:37:31 The founders intended for us to have the ability to overthrow any future tyrannical governments. Even if bump stocks existed at the time I highly doubt they would have been included or even considered as necessary. And yes, general rights come from & are taken by the government.
574 2018-02-27 20:37:30 Which is one of the many reasons we love you.   Note: if applicable,  people should call their company’s 401k fund managers and make sure their corporate plans are not invested in gun stocks, ie money funding @NRA #NeverAgain #WHATIF
575 2018-02-27 20:37:22 Does the @USPS even have stocks?
576 2018-02-27 20:37:21 Oh, it's definitely not your fault! I really thought that I had a good initial starting position here at .006 for a pop over .01 with the midday volume and bid support.
577 2018-02-27 20:37:15 1) the market is down because of rising interest rates

2) historically stocks do well during periods of rising rates

pick your narrative

579 2018-02-27 20:36:06 The #NRA being so weak on the right to keep and bear arms is a significant reason we are where we are today. Does anyone think if @GunOwners had been the group Trump was so closely associated with we would even be having this stupid ass conversation about bump stocks? #BoycottNRA
580 2018-02-27 20:35:57 Yes Following DT’ s use of the term Machine Gun yesterday in referring to effect of bump stocks. If your worried about lack of precision and accuracy leading to bad policy, you must really find this President dangerous?
581 2018-02-27 20:35:19 If the market fails to make a higher high and, instead, falls, it would  make a lower high, and set the stage for lower lows. In fact, stocks  were in lower-high territory Tuesday. ? @SantManukyan ur highness, ur opinion plz.
582 2018-02-27 20:34:49 If you Dems had the spine to ban the guns that bump-stocks work on, 

Bump-stocks would be a non-issue. 

But, wait. 

That's exactly WHY you want to ban bump-stocks in the first place, isn't it? 

#Spineless
583 2018-02-27 20:34:43 Yes, very good point. In October of 1999, my mail was tampered with and stocks tanked, just as I had been told they would.  I didn't take the threat seriously.  I do now...........
584 2018-02-27 20:34:43 No raising of the age. No banning bump stocks. 
Get support for an Amendment or sit and twirl.
585 2018-02-27 20:34:30 Water stocks?
586 2018-02-27 20:34:27 My stocks are in the red what is happening 
587 2018-02-27 20:33:48 Any attempt you make to restrict bump stocks (which aren’t even a weapon) or anything else will be met with total resist
588 2018-02-27 20:33:21 bump stocks should be outlawed
589 2018-02-27 20:32:15 You and I obviously have a different interpretation of the constitution, we also have different opinions on bump stocks being part of the 2nd amendment, my opinion hasn't changed, neither has yours. 
This conversation has reached its limit.
590 2018-02-27 20:30:46 No matter how we frame it either broadly..or very specifically.. raise age to 21.  Ban bump stocks.  Universal background checks.  You guys cry foul and scream repeal back at us.  So "us people" can't win either way.  So you take the easy way out with "shut up".

594 2018-02-27 20:29:49 As someone on the left, I feel you should tell me what this reason is...I mean other than all the dead people no one in the NRA wants to actually DO anything about. 
I’m fine with guns, just want 100% background checks, no bump stocks, and no high velocity rifles.
595 2018-02-27 20:29:44 Using coercion against one of your states biggest employer-not very bright.  FYI-the courts have ruled Assault weapons NOT guaranteed by 2nd amendment, bump stocks just make it illegal.  The NRA has become a terrorist organization IMO #guncontrolNOW
596 2018-02-27 20:29:40 In my humble opinion there will be only one group of people to blame for the next mass shooting in America. LAW MAKERS IN DC. 

I can’t understand why they wont ban assault rifles, bump stocks, and large magazine clips from the civilian population. It’s truly pathetic & cowardly.
597 2018-02-27 20:29:29 Enjoy While stocks last and always Dart responsibly!
598 2018-02-27 20:29:22 Bump stock ban doesn't go far enough.  What about nudge stocks?  And for the chainsaw attachment what about stump stocks?
599 2018-02-27 20:29:11 somebody @SEC_Enforcement  investigate @JohnCornyn to see if he or ties to groups shorted infrastructure stocks before he made his "comment" of speculation that hit the stocks
600 2018-02-27 20:29:07 BUUUT, they DID get a three-day waiting period for ALL gun purchases; they moved the age limit for buying a semiautomatic weapon from 18 to 21, got a new law to ease ability for cops to remove guns from the mentally ill, and no more bump stocks. NOT A BAD DAY AT ALL!!!!!!
601 2018-02-27 20:28:42 Just like yesterday's rally felt index driven, today's pullback looks to be index driven.  I just ran through the 250 names on my watch list and the vast majority of them are holding up just fine. The action in leading stocks is a lot more telling than how the averages are faring
602 2018-02-27 20:28:37 @POTUS From a once great President: “It’s a nasty truth, but those who seek to inflict harm are not fazed by gun control laws,” Reagan said. While I have no personal interest in Bump Stocks, it remains a way to eat the elephant one bite at a time.

606 2018-02-27 20:27:22 The president/republicans will have the next mass murder on their hands.Age/ better background/bump stocks not enough
607 2018-02-27 20:27:09 @wesbury what ever shall we do rates are going to 60%......god forbid we acknowledge economic grow by increasing rates....sell all of your stocks now!!!!  (Granted rates cannot move too aggressively but common people!)

613 2018-02-27 20:25:32 FYI-We r seeing less updates/prs from Companies due to rules saying they must be up to date w filings b4 putting out updates.  This is why we are seeing more stocks be less vocal.  I know patience is tough, but rather a co have fins up to date in stead of spew out bunch of fluff
614 2018-02-27 20:25:29 I am laying out six{6} proposals for Congress to consider . Ban Bump Stocks . Improve NIC system . Make 21 years old the youngest you buy a gun . Repeal the Dickey Amendment . No Reciprocity . Pass Toomey-Manchin 2013 . We don't want Congress selling us to the NRA so they can use
615 2018-02-27 20:25:23 Dow now down 200 points.. No surprise here with the market closing up on Friday and yesterday. #Stocks

623 2018-02-27 20:22:08 @ArmstrongTaran @OneLuckyGay @itsmelissaaa I was thinking for the stock watch, it would be fun instead of just like up or down or w/e, if each lfc member would buy three stocks of the people they think have the most win equity right now and with the person with the (part 1)
624 2018-02-27 20:22:06 Howard gets it.  Of course I knew this 18 years ago when my mail was tampered with at Town & Country Mo Post office., And stocks were crushed as threatened.
625 2018-02-27 20:21:49 right, all the stocks should tank
626 2018-02-27 20:21:30 Lets keep climbing. Very close to being current. Only assume we will receive something juicy after all the effort and $ for filings
627 2018-02-27 20:20:49 How are they a private company when have publicly traded stocks?
628 2018-02-27 20:20:32 Thank GOODNESS MA had the good SENSE to ban bump stocks after the mass shooting on Las Vegas 
629 2018-02-27 20:20:32 Yep! Just like with Oscar there has been NO test done for DNA and everyone is calling this kid a Q and throwing ELQ shares at him and Kim. Give me a #cheekswab son before you get some Q &amp; stocks. #GH
630 2018-02-27 20:20:19 Wouldn't lowering the price almost 50% cause the stocks to lose money?
631 2018-02-27 20:20:17 @NancyPelosi  We want to tell Congress what we want . We don't want Congress telling us what you will do for us . Must be 21 to buy a gun. Repeal Dickey Amendment . No recipocity bill . Ban Bump Stocks . Pass Toomey-Manchin 2013 .

633 2018-02-27 20:19:33 They use bump stocks to send off mass emails.
634 2018-02-27 20:19:30 Have had several comments from conservatives where they lie, saying people are trying to ban ALL guns. People are only asking to get military-grade weapons & bump stocks off the streets, & to keep guns out of the hands of crazy people.

None of that will affect 99% of gun owners.

640 2018-02-27 20:18:30 Lots of professions are like that though.  Take a look at stock analysts.  All they do is analyze numbers and trends and give their advice on stocks.  A lot of that is speculation.  Same thing with draft analysts.

644 2018-02-27 20:17:14 The NRA members are typically law abiding gun owners. But the NRA org's policy of lawsuits against background checks (Printz), against banning bump stocks, against mental health checks, against red flag laws helps ONLY bad guns, not law abiding sane citizens.
645 2018-02-27 20:16:27 @SenSchumer  I agree with your holistic aproach to gun control . Fix NIC system . Ban Bump Stocks . Ban Assault Weapons . Toomey-Manchin 2013 . Repeal the Dickey Amendment .

652 2018-02-27 20:14:04 A year ago he criticized a hypothetical $4 billion AF1 deal with Boeing. Did it as revenge for their CEO questioning him. Boeing’s stocks fell as a result. Just wanted to remind everyone.
653 2018-02-27 20:14:00

654 2018-02-27 20:13:52 I haven’t traded stocks for a month because of this whole sick thing first day back and I almost bank 300$ I been studying this shit for to long to not profit off these plays
655 2018-02-27 20:13:50 If you didn’t know, the Dow Jones industrial index tracks 30 different stocks in it. The S&P 500 tracks the 500 largest companies in America.
656 2018-02-27 20:13:50 Yeah, some do basically the same job as a bump stock.  Which is why I keep saying that outlawing bump stocks will do nothing.

665 2018-02-27 20:10:19 Should be banning a lot more than bump stocks.  That’s like a pee in the ocean with the gun problems you have. Crazy

674 2018-02-27 20:05:46 Even with that said, most of my profits lately have been on the long side in select stocks posting powerful breakouts.  My avg gain lately has been 14% and avg loss 6% with a 40% win/loss ratio.  Not perfect, but enough to make decent money.

676 2018-02-27 20:04:49 Yeah, and he converted them to near-automatic fire with bump stocks - which are designed to circumvent a good law pertaining to auto-fire rifles. I believe bump stocks should be regulated like machine guns. Not banned, just heavily regulated.

679 2018-02-27 20:04:06 #Gunsense Trump tells us not to worry about bump stocks. Except without Congressional action, it takes years to use a regulatory ban. So, we are worried. And, for that matter, don't trust him...even a little bit.
680 2018-02-27 20:03:46 Anyone who wants to ban bump stocks is incredibly ignorant on bump firing.
681 2018-02-27 20:03:43 Some sort of multi-day pullback here wouldn't be surprising.  The breadth of stocks behind this advance has been paltry, at best, which indicates dead-cat bounce action in big stocks more so than a broad advance.

699 2018-02-27 19:57:17 1) Legislative ban for bump stocks.

2) Legislatively declare Trump to be a bump stock.
700 2018-02-27 19:57:02 Start with bump stocks. Stricter background checks.  Military grade assault rifles need to be regulated (I’d actually prefer an outright ban) . Pass actual legislation.
701 2018-02-27 19:56:25 Minimum age 21 to buy a gun, mandatory background checks and banning bump stocks. That's the least we can do for our kids. #Parkland @SenateGOP @SenateDems @SenateMajLdr @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan #ParklandShooting #ParklandStudents @USATODAY @BuzzFeedNews @BuzzFeed
702 2018-02-27 19:56:15 How's Trump a 2A supporter, given his statement this week about outlawing bump stocks by royal declaration, and raising rifle ownership age to 21?

708 2018-02-27 19:53:10 @HouseGOP and @HouseDemocrats Please pass legislation for mandatory background checks for all gun purchases, outlaw automatic weapons, bump stocks for private use These are useless for hunting, target shooting & home defense Mandatory 21 yrs age limit for gun purchases
709 2018-02-27 19:53:07 I think you’re quite stupid thinking you’re not pumping your stocks
710 2018-02-27 19:52:57 Steven Paddock allegedly used bump stocks to modify his semi-auto rifles into mimicking the effects of a fully auto.  The bump stock has been recommended to be banned and I would hope that anyone who argues for smart gun control would agree and support banning all bump stocks.
711 2018-02-27 19:52:02 They’re some stubborn bastards. Especially since it has been reported that their stocks are going up by over 2 1/2 points if I’m not mistaken. Big businesses using @FedEx services shld pull out to send a message!
712 2018-02-27 19:51:57 Bump stocks are not protected by the 2nd amendment and was the NRAs talking point after the mass shootings in Law Vegas! This is not reform!
713 2018-02-27 19:51:51 In what possible context is allowing bump stocks a good idea?

However, certain guns (assault weapons) or accessories (bump stocks) must NEVER be given to any person not in police/military.

742 2018-02-27 19:42:48 I totally agree. But if Congress can't get it done on bump stocks (which are absurd - go see the YouTube videos) then I wouldn't object to the Trump DOJ acting on its own. We have to draw some new lines here even if the Congressional GOP won't come along.
743 2018-02-27 19:42:18 Not very good risk reward to buy these stocks at these prices!
744 2018-02-27 19:42:09 May Congress come to some agreement on Gun Control, particularly on banning assualt rifles and Bump Stocks.#AJ
745 2018-02-27 19:41:56 I don't know about Biden, but he's not in office. Feinstein legislation has included banning bump stocks for some assault weapons. Currently she is supporting raising purchase age for some assault weapons. I'll be more clear. No one is proposing to ban guns thru legislation.
746 2018-02-27 19:41:47 I'd try shutting up.  You have become so polarizing that you'll have their stocks soaring in no time if you keep it up.
747 2018-02-27 19:41:26 If teachers have the right to be armed, except for students it would be a good idea. But if they are armed. they would have to wear a special uniform. Gun control is needed. Get rid of semiautomatics, bump stocks and take away guns from incompetent, violent offenders & dangerous.

754 2018-02-27 19:39:59 not about liberal or conservative it’s about giving unlimited weaponry and ammo  to all while someone ddcides whether they are of sound mind-takes absolutely no courage to ban bump stocks or to decide whether 18 yr olds are more apt to kill than s 21 yr old—ignorance is rampant

756 2018-02-27 19:39:43 You do realize that most mutual funds own stocks in gun company's. Teacher Unions and the like. #DavidHoogHasLessMeatThanACheeseSandwich

759 2018-02-27 19:38:43 "Gun control" is a progressive whitch hunt against the 2nd amendment too. The bump stocks have never been proven to be used in any school shooting...those are nothing but toys..Its all smoke and mirrors to try to divide the voters. In other words its a BS move to trigger emotions
760 2018-02-27 19:38:37 @ChrisVanHollen I got your email.  I agree with @POTUS  in his use of Executive Order to eliminate "bump stocks", because of the INACTION of Congress! #cspanchat #executiveorder

762 2018-02-27 19:37:50 absolutely true. you become these knuckleheads of "errr P/E is 16, this means we need to scale out of stocks" blah blah blah.
763 2018-02-27 19:37:26 Generally, index funds buy the market (...or market sector) without making ideological distinctions among the stocks they purchase, so this isn't surprising.  There are "ethical" funds that try to make these distinctions, but they're a niche and necessarily cost more.
764 2018-02-27 19:36:58 @GovRickScott Please outlaw purchase of automatic weapons like the AR 15 , bump stocks, large magazines No one needs these weapons They are terrible for hunting, target shooting and even defense as AR 15 bullets can bounce against walls. Students demand sanity in gun control

Ban bump stocks
Put people who own assault weapons on a registry, unless they turn them in for cash.

Save hundreds of lives. Save our kids.

800 2018-02-27 19:28:19 McSally gun message/strategy = NRA talk/strategy. Example: They say we don't need to ban bump stocks or any legislation to control them, we just need regulations through ATF. (A red herring because ATF has already ruled they can't regulate bump stocks...)
801 2018-02-27 19:28:17 I just feel like we've become so distracted from the real issue by arming teachers and bump stocks and boycotting FedEx and attacking the local police.

839 2018-02-27 19:13:48 Senator, bump stocks are only one means of turning semi automatic weapons into full autos. There are ways that require no additional equipment. Semi automatic rifles are not for hunting. High capacity magazines are not for hunting. Both need to be illegal.

There are very valid reasons the NRA also wants Faux Full Auto Bump Stocks regulated.

Faux Full Auto is an existential threat to all Semi Auto firearms and the Obummer BATFE knew it when the Bump Stock rulings came down.
863 2018-02-27 19:05:19 @SpeakerRyan It's the guns, stupid!!! Stop playing Judas and advocate meaningful gun control measures to save lives:  Ban assault weapons, Require background checks for ALL gun sales; & Ban Bump Stocks for  starters.

871 2018-02-27 19:02:26 I believe the use of AR style firearms was confirmed in conjunction with bump stocks. While not capable of achieving belt fed fire rates, bump stocks do greatly increase fire rate (while greatly reducing accuracy). Worth noting that bump fire is not specific to ARs.
872 2018-02-27 19:02:24 Point is there are other weapons designed to do more damage in less time. Thus, the AR doesn’t qualify as being designed to do the most damage in the least amount of time. Also, the vegas shooter used bump stocks to increase fire rate. AR-15s as issued aren’t that fast.
873 2018-02-27 19:02:21 If the #FED are not in a hurry to raise rates while equity markets near ATH, then how can they raise rates if we are so close to a #Recession ?

The second amended isn't about citizens having  AR-15 and bump stocks, etc..
Yes, all people have a right to bear arms.

883 2018-02-27 18:59:37 Agreed. But inaction isn't the answer. Allow CDC to study gun violence. Universal background checks. Ban bump stocks. DO SOMETHING . @SpeakerRyan
884 2018-02-27 18:59:05 As it stands more steady sources like 401k and certain stocks. I did mined 1BTC but sold it too early years before the boom that led to the exponential jump in value (2014 for $150)
885 2018-02-27 18:58:18 Volatility and liquidity are the determinants of gaining,if the equity market is sluggish you'll have to wait longer to realize gains regardless of buying penny cheap stocks
886 2018-02-27 18:57:53 @PaulRyanSpeaker what if it was your children & their school would you then consider banning the MILITARY style assault weapons, what don't you get about this, we are not asking you to ban guns, we are asking that you ban military style assault weapons & bump-stocks plus b/g cks

890 2018-02-27 18:57:01 where? everywhere you look! Havent seen such bearish commentary on pot stocks in many many months. Everyone predicting how much lower they are all going and everyone saying how they already sold out and may  come back sometime in future. Only a rare few openly still bullish.

894 2018-02-27 18:54:42 Mkt still attracting desperate wanna-owners, speculators, parents of 4N students, offshore diversifiers. Rental property owners not buying now - cap rates too low, don't believe prices will hold up, waiting for price drop. Like late bull mkt in stocks. Little affordable stock.

896 2018-02-27 18:54:18 @SpeakerRyan clearly u do not care one bit abt anyone’s life other than ur own. We should ban YOU from holding any gov’t office, as well as all weapons of war, and there subsequent ammunition, bump stocks, etc...enough is enough. How many more innocent ppl need die!? #NeverAgain
897 2018-02-27 18:53:23 Even law abiding citizens don't need bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and AR 15s
898 2018-02-27 18:52:44 The general public has NO need for automatic weapons of any kind. Ban them, and bump stocks as well. Talk is cheap, potus. DO SOMETHING!!
899 2018-02-27 18:52:29 Of course, you only like to hear things that support your pre-conceived notions. [psst: legislation is already underway to ban bump-stocks. problem solved.]
900 2018-02-27 18:51:44 Maybe if you disagreed on the premise that they said utility tokens "are" stocks, instead they said "like" stocks.... stating that utility is less like currency and more like stocks
901 2018-02-27 18:51:03 Why not stop selling assualt rifles? Bump stocks are kinda pointless then. Market Forces at work!
902 2018-02-27 18:50:58 The debate is not about the fundamental right to bear arms. It’s about the contours of that right which is a political question. Does one have a constitutional right to an AR-15? To extended clips? Bump stocks? This is where a utilitarian analysis is appropriate.
903 2018-02-27 18:50:54 Millenials work hard, & play too. Rather than be tied down w/a mortgage, they travel, buy RVs, experience the world. Their stocks are different. They are better off in many qualitative ways than us elders! They’re neither to be pitied nor condemned.
904 2018-02-27 18:50:28 Allowing the ATF to ban bump stocks, has the effect of insulating lawmakers from voter accountability undermining the Constitution. The bureaucrats at the ATF, are insulated from voter accountability because they aren’t up for election. The  ban should come through congress.
905 2018-02-27 18:50:18 I like how TRUMP just CAVED in to the shooting in FLORIDA that we all know was a False  Flag Attack including Las Vegas. He now states he is going to personally write up the EO BANNING Bump-stocks? When most people didn’t even have a clue as to what they were prior to LV! Wow

914 2018-02-27 18:47:41 Jacob probably doesn't care - I can totally imagine him having stocks in companies that would benefit from a war... So if people die, as long as he makes a profit, it's all good! Your money won't help you in jail though :)
915 2018-02-27 18:47:36 Exactly. If more banks do this then it may slow the progression of bitcoin cause less people will be able to buy. Gotta make sure you got stocks as a back up.
916 2018-02-27 18:47:25 Trying to ban bump stocks through regulation could be tied up in court for YEARS. Just another way to pass the buck and avoid taking a vote that would upset the gun lobby. Passing legislation is the ONLY way to get this done NOW. #BanBumpStocks
917 2018-02-27 18:47:06 In a low tax , high interest environment , financial industry will benefit a lot. Thus, stocks like Goldman Sachs may be a good buying opportunity $GC #NASDAQ #DJIA #USStocks #stocks #insights
918 2018-02-27 18:46:47 The NRA supported banning bump stocks. They did not sort the Feinstein bill because it banned anything that would increase semi-automatic guns to full auto such as trigger switches.

920 2018-02-27 18:45:12 America wants in-depth and complete background checks, no loopholes, longer wait time, BANNING weapons of war/assault weapons, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks

929 2018-02-27 18:41:54 I don't care if bump stocks get banned or not. I don't see the point of having one, but at the same time to spend so much time on something that can be made in a kitchen with a drill and some screws. Seems like a waist of time. Its like banning cookies to fight obesity.
930 2018-02-27 18:41:21 Total BS. Bump stocks are sold EVERY DAY. Makes the AR-15 fully automatic.

Disgusting.
942 2018-02-27 18:37:42 The ultimate victory in America would be an #assaultweaponsban. Other things like enhanced background checks, digital database, banning bump stocks, etc are required too, but AWB would be the most effective measure to reduce gun violence
943 2018-02-27 18:37:13 you did well there! Most pot stocks are now taking a bounce too.

963 2018-02-27 18:33:07 This is logical as Congress did not make bump stocks legal, that was Obama's ATF.  Since it was an ATF call that made them legal, it seems that the current ATF should be able to undo that.

981 2018-02-27 18:27:13 As someone who doesn't have time to sit and watch stocks all day, the 30/30/40 rule has been a huge help in locking in profits while I can.   True I might not see as big of gains as some do, but it has certainly helped on missing out on them completely.

990 2018-02-27 18:24:11 If you are referring to bump stocks, they do NOT make an AR automatic.
The, simply put, take advantage of the semi-auto feature of the gun, making it rapid fire and extremely inaccurate. You can do much the same with any semi-auto without aids.

BTW I support banning bump stocks.

998 2018-02-27 18:21:32 @SpeakerRyan Wtf is so hard about a total ban on assault weapons, bump stocks and conversion kits? A ban on these weapons does nothing to impede on 2nd Amendment. Nor does raising the legal age of gun purchase to 21. Is the @NRA blackmailing you, or are you a coward?#NeverAgain
999 2018-02-27 18:21:08 Explain to me, again, how the @NRA position on bump stocks, semi-automatic weapons is a #CONSERVATIVE position? Sorry, I CAN’T HEAR YOU.
1000 2018-02-27 18:20:57 ... the ambiguous one had no mention of a bump stock, though they claimed it was for bump stocks.  Even using the FIND command on my browser couldn't even find either pattern. Don't judge a bill by its cover.
1001 2018-02-27 18:20:35 He's already a cosponsor of a bill to ban bump stocks
1002 2018-02-27 18:20:00 .... After LV, there were some bills proposed in IL, and one of them was very open and ambiguous on its text, while another was very clear and straight forward.  I opposed the ambiguous one but supported the clear one (ban/restrict specifically bump stocks).  ...
1003 2018-02-27 18:19:58 "Fed done handholding the market" - LOL.  USD higher def notable...think could see bounce.  TLT selling off again with equities selling off a big tell IMO.

1012 2018-02-27 18:18:17 Except even when they make sense nothing gets done. They came out againist bump stocks after Vegas and Congress still sat on it and did nothing. Now Trump is claiming he's going to executive action it away

Hopefully they'll also experience customer/shareholders #BoycottNRAboycotters backlash from all #2Asupporters - including selling /shorting/boycotting their stocks UNTIL THEIR CEO IS REPLACED.
1018 2018-02-27 18:16:38 Yeah I don't understand what the threat is.  No one is coming to take their guns.  I doubt they'll even make the AR 15 illegal,.  The only thing a law abiding over 21 year old non-wife beating gun owner might lose are some NRA discounts and MAYBE bump stocks.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1019 2018-02-27 18:16:18 An early advance for London stocks faltered in the final hour of trading , despite strong earnings from the likes of Persimmon and a counter bid for Sky from Comcast, 1/2...
1020 2018-02-27 18:16:00 and while all that was going on the NRA has been fighting against reasonable assault weapon restrictions like banning bump stocks and for YEARS for that MATTER!

1023 2018-02-27 18:14:39 Remember: was pretty bipartisan (citizens, voters, cong. dems) agreement that banning "bump stocks" was nobrainier.

Only after FL made #NRA toxic & criticism directed at @realDonaldTrump did he get on board w/ the idea.

1035 2018-02-27 18:11:49 Leadership that's a joke....dum Donald came out of the gate strong on a couple of things...age, bump Stocks and after meeting with the NRA  he is back to arming teachers the dumbest idea anyone has ever had.  An NRA idea because it means more guns sold and available which is dum.
1036 2018-02-27 18:11:31 Yep you are right, the smart money buys in when its "boring" aka the sideways trading patterns. There is no "smart money" buying Weed stocks right now

1039 2018-02-27 18:10:37 Thus my original statement...Bump stocks are not necessary to easily bump fire a Semi-Auto weapon they are just a accessory for bragging rights.

1042 2018-02-27 18:10:06 @HARRISFAULKNER This AGE thing is crazy.. A nut case like the shooter will get a gun no matter what age he or she is. Banning bump stocks is just a political move that won't help stop any mass killings.. No common Sense here.

1044 2018-02-27 18:09:47 Banning Bump Stocks? Is that appeasement to the anti-2A, anti-gun, eventual-gun-confiscation lobby? You’re giving them wins, slowly eroding rights that 99.9% of the people know how to safely handle. Don’t cave, Bobby O!  Stay focused on root causes and not mere inanimate objects.

1056 2018-02-27 18:06:20 I was shocked at Powell's go along approach. He basically agreed that deportation of illegals would hurt US productivity; balancing the budget is not a good goal. 72% of Americans own stocks, not 50%. Pandering to liberals? WTF???

1058 2018-02-27 18:06:05 @Alyssa_Milano more than 40% of Americans do not own stocks.

1059 2018-02-27 18:05:42 So I knew nothing (absolutely zilch) about stocks and shares until I signed up for @ambiej's newsletter called Better Have My Money. I suddenly feel a tad more learned
1060 2018-02-27 18:05:29 Now banning options I think MIGHT have a chance but, I still think regulations and certifications are better options.

1. High capacity magazines 
2. Bump stocks
3. Perhaps the AR15 

Maybe these have a chance. But, depends on if enough people want it.

1070 2018-02-27 18:03:51 Obama ATF allowed bump stocks and covered up gun running w/ Fast & Furious.  Biden brought us defenseless victim zones.  NRA advocates for gun safety and self-defense and liberals attack them.  Perhaps banning liberals would be more effective at protecting schools and kids.
1071 2018-02-27 18:02:41 The proof is in the pudding. @NRA and its supporters clearly think that the ability to own an assault weapon, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines is more important than mitigating the risk of school shootings.

1107 2018-02-27 17:55:34 President Trump,
Please stop the conversation about arming teachers. They are there to teach. Law-enforcement should be the ones handling school security. I support you and I’m also a licensed concealed carry holder in CA.  I also agree with you on prohibiting bump stocks, age.

1128 2018-02-27 17:49:49 U.S. stocks sold off and Treasuries retreated as investors weighed Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s assessment that the central bank won’t rush to raise rates even though he expects the economy to pick up steam. The dollar advanced.
1129 2018-02-27 17:49:47 One man fired more than 1,100 shots in the Las Vegas massacre. That’s why the AR-15, AR-15 style weapons, ammunition and bump stocks are at the center of the gun debate.   Sensible gun control is needed. @realDonaldTrump @SpeakerRyan

1133 2018-02-27 17:48:43 Bump stocks?? When it is the AR15 alone, that is being used over & over again in mass shootings? Ban ALL Military grade weapons! If U want 2 shoot semi-fully automatic gun join the Military. The Inventor of the AR15 said it’s ONLY intent is 2 kill people, lots of people, in WAR.
1134 2018-02-27 17:48:39 Trump said he would sign legislation to eliminate bump stocks. In the mean time he’s doing it through executive management. Don’t blame him. Blame congress.
1135 2018-02-27 17:48:30 We need more than background checks. We must ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
1136 2018-02-27 17:48:25 Today could be a 10000$ day! $MNK is coming down and I am short 4k! #trading #stocks #money
1137 2018-02-27 17:48:16 News Flash Bump stocks are gone under @realDonaldTrump He will sign an exec order if necessary.
1138 2018-02-27 17:47:51 Ive supported Mr. Trump throughout  his campaign and presidency, but his recent statements regarding new gun laws will lose my vote. His talk of using an executive order to ban bump stocks is unconstitutional and I will do everything in my power to help fight it. No compromise!
1139 2018-02-27 17:47:44 Stocks continue the fall on Powell comments. S&P approaches MA support.  S&P index approaches its 200 hour MA
The comments from Fed Chair Powell have scared the stock/bond markets a bit. 
The 10 year yield is up 5.5 bps to 2.9172%. The high reached 2.9227%.
1140 2018-02-27 17:47:40 I think the Chinese stocks are canary in coal mine visa v.the USD. TSLA holding 350 NVDA green. Its amazing what is considered 'weak' day. the standard is so low.
1141 2018-02-27 17:47:28 Sit on it. There's no rush. Are you buying individual stocks/ETFs? Be sure to watch your trading fees. I never buy stocks with less than $1k unless free trades through Robinhood or similar.

1144 2018-02-27 17:47:01 I think business should belong to the workers. If we could transfer stocks to the players and staff, I would.
1145 2018-02-27 17:47:00 But these “poisoned” children should apparently still have access to AR-15s with bump stocks and 30 round magazines

1147 2018-02-27 17:46:15 @kevincorke Google “digital trigger”.  These are worse than bump stocks, and flying under the radar.
1148 2018-02-27 17:46:02 .Yeah, encouraging 17-year olds to run around telling people what stocks to sell while other classmates of the dead take selfies grinning and laughing about what celebrities they are is an effective, unifying strategy that will solve the problem.   :-(
1149 2018-02-27 17:45:11 Thank you @RepSchrader for no longer soliciting or accepting funding from the NRA. However, would really like to hear a lot more from you beyond reversing Dickey rule and expanding background checks. How about banning bump stocks, hi cap magazines and assault rifles, as a start?

1168 2018-02-27 17:40:38 @Emma4Change Upu ARE making a difference!  First time boycott of companies with NRA discounts. Talks of banning bump stocks—first time since Vegas!  Activists have been trying for months!  THANK YOU!!
1169 2018-02-27 17:40:29 Well, your selective use of quotes from the article is just as specious. Why not include this one? 

“Banning bump stocks and raising the age of purchase for assault rifles from 18 to 21 are good ideas, and may lead to a decrease in overall gun violence”
1170 2018-02-27 17:38:47 Talk, talk all you want about how to mitigate the assault rifle crisis. Raise the age limit, ban bump stocks, tighter background checks, whatever.
Fully automatic weapons require special rigorous licensing. Start there, or ban them entirely. ARs are no less lethal. 
#BoycottNRA
1171 2018-02-27 17:38:33 My stocks seem to be resembling my life because they’re in a constant spiral downward to have like 3 good hours of stability to then spiral down again
1172 2018-02-27 17:38:03 Give politicians stocks in RAT software and it'll be legal soon enough.
1173 2018-02-27 17:37:53 @jeffsessions Banning bump stocks alone makes no sense. If a device designed to make a semi-automatic gun fire faster should be illegal, then it stands to reason that all automatic rifles should be kept out of the hands of everyday citizens.
1174 2018-02-27 17:36:59 @Hazel_Halll Bitcoin to me is no different than when Ron Paul suggests the best thing Americans can do to secure money is to invest in Silver stocks; while silver remains valued at $15 an ounce; and has been a latter end investment since 1992.

1176 2018-02-27 17:36:38 Then you are a bigger fool than I thought. no to arming teachers, bump stocks need to be banned, high capacity mags need to be banned or strictly limited, assault type weapons need to be banned. Yes to: strong background checks, psych evals, registration, licensing, limit ammo.
1177 2018-02-27 17:36:25 so confused! Obama admin said bump stocks were good with a stroke of his pen...
1178 2018-02-27 17:36:09 What about Sam's club? Close 60 stores and layed of thousands. Why are companies buying up their own stocks? Sounds like a loser bill to me. 
I see that you are still on the ownership list for the NRA.
1179 2018-02-27 17:36:01 University 'directors' never fail to prove themselves just as guilty as, and often shadier than, all the people and groups they claim to oppose. This is likely an 'efficiency mechanism' to hire 15% more admin, put rest of 'saved' money into petrol stocks, etc.
1180 2018-02-27 17:35:13 A start. No silencers, no bump stocks, no cop killer rounds, no super shooter magazines.
1181 2018-02-27 17:34:48 Sadly you are right. Until we elect legislators not owned by the NRA no action will be taken. After the horrific shooting in Las Vegas they couldn’t even ban bump stocks. One terrorist tries to blow up a plane with a shoe & we all remove shoes now.
1182 2018-02-27 17:34:39 Ban semi-automatic rifles, not just so-called assault rifles -- no loopholes, this time, please. Bump stocks aren't useful with bolt-action rifles.
1183 2018-02-27 17:33:43 Powell starts his first talk with a down note. Stocks sell off as he is clearly no #Yellen It will prove to be a fatal mistake not extending her term. Sad really. #Fed is not your friend.
1184 2018-02-27 17:33:40 Ok, that's one issue, what about banning assault rifles? Background checks for all sales? Ban on bump stocks? Ban of large capacity magazines? None which are covered under the 2nd Amendment. We've a long way to go.

1188 2018-02-27 17:31:57 Oh, and I would also agree to banning bump stocks. They're not useful for self defense (full auto generally isn't. They're meant for suppressive fire in combat zones) unlike SA rifles, and would thus not really be a loss to the rights of an average person.

1220 2018-02-27 17:26:22 if I might channel some RW logic. If we pass a law banning bump stocks. Only criminals will have them. So we shouldn't pass laws because criminals will just break the laws.. repeat and repeat
1221 2018-02-27 17:25:56 NRA's position on bump fire stocks... they want them regulated/banned
1222 2018-02-27 17:25:55 This is the strategy of the pro-gun side.  Limit the debate to just the specifics of the most recent tragedy.

Sandy Hook/Aurora: Mental health
Orlando/San Bernardino: Terrorism
Vegas: Bump stocks
Parkland: "School security"

Never guns, though.
1223 2018-02-27 17:25:52 I had never heard of "bump stocks ", after watching a video of one in operation I agree, civilians don't need those. It turns an AR-15 into an M-16 A1, which can empty a 30 round magazine by hold the trigger. Don't get me wrong, in the Army full auto was fun.
1224 2018-02-27 17:25:46 Any headline that reads "Powell Testimony Sends Stocks lower" would be well off the mark.  Fed Chairman Powell has barely spoke this lawmakers use all their time to spout "facts" and try to get the Fed to back their notion of economics.  I'm cringing watching this farce.
1225 2018-02-27 17:25:43 I bet they do. The NRA supported Trump, and yet trump wants to ban bump stocks and raise the age to 21 to buy a rifle. You think the NRA wants that?

1257 2018-02-27 17:18:16 1. Ban bump stocks
2. Ban high capacity magazines
3. Ban armor-piercing bullets
4. Ban personal ownership of assault weapons but allow use in gun ranges
5. Require registration of ALL guns
6. Require 3 day waiting period for purchase
7. Fix background check system
#GunReformNow
1258 2018-02-27 17:18:03 Common sense. Mandatory background checks on ALL sales. Ban on high capacity ammunition weapons and bump stocks (perhaps allowable at gun ranges for sport shooting). Red flag notices should prohibit people from buying guns. Raise the age of purchase to 21. Etc, etc.
1259 2018-02-27 17:17:55 When the whole stock market is down, that effects all stocks... Including gun stocks.

1262 2018-02-27 17:16:54 Pro-life requires protecting the born, too.  Ban high capacity magazines, bump stocks and reinstate the mental health requirements that Trump repealed.
1263 2018-02-27 17:16:53 @SpeakerRyan Since Sep 29, 2017 there have been 1,875 total death and each time you do nothing. Time's Up. Blaming does nothing. What do they have in common? Weapons of mass destruction: assault weapons, bump stocks, large capacity magazines...
1264 2018-02-27 17:16:41 And there is already legislative action moving forward on banning bump stocks. Problem solved.
1265 2018-02-27 17:16:37 Terrible bcoz interest rate will go high and stocks may give lower returns since many co. run on bank money or run away with bank money.
1266 2018-02-27 17:16:17 Just received my response to my #GunControlNow email from @SenPatRoberts  Phone call too. He is solidly behind the 2nd Amendment and did not mention anything about talking about bump stocks, hi-cap magazines, AR-15s or better background checks. #NRABoycott #FloridaShooting
1267 2018-02-27 17:15:44 Realistically, HOW MANY LIVES per year might be saved by the #BanBumpStocks approach?

PLEASE, answer this question

 My guess?  Other approaches will make us far safer, and that this ban would be about as effective as window-dressing

We have bigger gun issues than bump stocks
1268 2018-02-27 17:15:27 @Equinox99 those are 2 different stocks buddy with completely different issues
1269 2018-02-27 17:15:11 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, we understand the gun violence must end put your push to end pump stocks is an Obama attempt which will be political suicide. We voted you in so our guns would not be infringed, a bump fire wasn't used! What R U doing? You will end a second term!

1271 2018-02-27 17:14:21 They're playing you like a fool. The NRA does NOT support legislative action on bump stocks. They support "additional regulation" which in the end means NOTHING because no government agency (ATF included) can regulate an accessory BY LAW.  

Feel free to google it. I'm at work.

1275 2018-02-27 17:12:39 but agreed
1276 2018-02-27 17:12:25 Didn’t DOJ under Obama say that these types of rules could only be done through Congress?  Looks like they will try to do this knowing it will be tied up in court until it dies and then they can blame someone else for not banning bump stocks.

1285 2018-02-27 17:10:58 Yes, it is best to manage fish stocks - but that is a no-brainer for any country wanting sustainability! Canada managed the cod stock moratorium all on its own! It didn't need the 28 to make the decision... our own fisheries business decimated

1288 2018-02-27 17:09:44 Well #Cheetolini had this to say yesterday
“Bump stocks, we are writing that out. I am writing that out,” he said, addressing a group of state governors at the White House. “I don’t care if Congress does it or not, I’m writing it out myself."
1289 2018-02-27 17:09:30 Just once this month I'd like to check on my stocks without seeing articles about worst market collapse in years, U.S. sparking global recession, biggest fall since such and such...and so on. #yourboydoinggood

1291 2018-02-27 17:09:21 I stated fact. I'm stating the laws the NRA supports, and Paul Ryan supports. They do NOT support extended background checks. They do NOT support limits on magazine sizes. They do NOT support a law to ban things like bump stocks. They do NOT support raising the age to 21.
1292 2018-02-27 17:09:21 New stocks of cake slices @PennyPetroleum Beal Services
1293 2018-02-27 17:09:01 Yep, banning bump stocks is "feel good" legislation... it's a distraction.
1294 2018-02-27 17:08:25 Banning bump stocks will prevent rifles from becoming Assault Weapons. Obviously you are saying Assault Weapons should be banned.  So ban Assault Weapons as well. It’s a no brainer.  The Americans public will be very happy. Don’t & face the wrath of American voters on Nov. 18
1295 2018-02-27 17:07:57 Respectfully speaking.....no we don't and a new bill supporting ban on bump stocks can be passed without having to support your bill! Saying that is like saying we dont have choices??!! I am an NRA member and support banning bump stocks!!
1296 2018-02-27 17:07:42 January 2016, the O.P.C.W. announced that the last of the Syrian stocks had been destroyed.
1297 2018-02-27 17:07:38 Converting a semi auto into a full auto is. Right now they are evaluating if bump stocks actually do that
1298 2018-02-27 17:07:33 Eh I'm not getting into the weeds with it like Erickson did. There's nothing to be gained from an adult calling a 17 year old a bully. When he starts investing in stocks, paying taxes, etc.. I'm game. Cooke takes him apart without having to go that far.

1302 2018-02-27 17:07:03 Have you survived a mass shooting? 
No, go away
Assault weapons aren't covered under 2A. Bump stocks, sports, collection  isn't covered under 2A.

1304 2018-02-27 17:06:01 RT @SenFeinstein: Trying to ban bump stocks through regulation could be tied up in court for YEARS. Just another way to pass the buck and avoid taking a vote that would upset the gun lobby. Passing legislation is the ONLY way to get this done NOW. #BanBumpStocks
1305 2018-02-27 17:06:01 Moving to outlaw bump stocks is a tacit admission that everyday citizens shouldn't have semi-automatic / automatic weapons. Period. 

Only getting rid of bump stocks is like putting a band-aid on a tumor. #NeverAgain @realDonaldTrump

1317 2018-02-27 17:03:17 Asking you to share your opinion on the following questions as you are a firearms instructor.
1.  Do bump stocks make a gun more lethal?
2.  Can you quickly kill more people with a 30 round magazine or a 10?
3.  Is an "assault weapon" generally more lethal than a "regular" gun?

1324 2018-02-27 17:01:03 1. The bump stock was outlawed under President Bush in 2005.

2. The Obama Administration reversed this decision legalizing bump stocks in 2010.

3. NO lobbying effort by the NRA, Republicans or conservatives for legalizing bump stocks. This was team Obama's decision

1327 2018-02-27 17:00:56 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

1336 2018-02-27 16:58:26 I focused my analysis on seeking to identify the factors that were strongly correlated to a stock's price movement as opposed to looking at all the fundamentals.  Frankly, even today, many analysts still don't know what makes their particular stocks go up and down.

1338 2018-02-27 16:57:57 Banning bump stocks might be more effective if they are simultaneously reclassified as an NFA restricted item, as are suppressors.
1339 2018-02-27 16:57:45 So the democrats create a whole gun control scandal just to spook more Americans into buying guns. sales have gone up significantly since the parkland schooling.

1344 2018-02-27 16:57:05 Entire gun industry should be smothered to its last breath. Removing bump stocks & A R 15 wont cut it. Should another weapon not be sold in America for next 10 years there would still be to many guns.
1345 2018-02-27 16:56:39 Trump is doing away with bump stocks right??? Havent really looked into it yet, but if he has then there you go @davidhogg111 some gun control. Of course ppl can still make add a bump illegally or even just make the gun too while they're at it.

1368 2018-02-27 16:50:59 So in other words, the bad guys that are not concerned about breaking laws even if self production of them becomes illegal, they still have the means to do so. Again its only a ABS "plastic" part. The 3D files are all over the internet for full size Bump Stocks or Bump Devices
1369 2018-02-27 16:50:57 Yes I have. I’ve shot a few guns in my days including an AR-10 and other higher powered rifles. The only difference from it and an M-16 is the full auto. Which bump stocks take care of.

1372 2018-02-27 16:49:38 Totally valid point & I anticipated this when I wrote this post. My point is that it’s not just about kelp declines, but about what happens in the aftermath. We might see resurgence of kelp stocks, but we’re also seeing more invaders & we’re also going to be seeing more warming.

1380 2018-02-27 16:48:30 You can fire as fast as your finger goes, if you’re  a proficient shooter you don’t need a bump stock. Automatic weapons are illegal. Bump stocks should be illegal. You can equip a handgun with a laser sight and fire 17 bullets just as fast as an AR-15.

1407 2018-02-27 16:42:25 I think, sadly, that the "savers" lobby doesn't stand a chance.  Recalling that the President not long ago assured me that I needn't concern myself with the national debt (or deficit-both!) because stocks were up. I'd like to at least think he meant the treasury markets...but nah
1408 2018-02-27 16:42:14 Germany is faced with an alcohol shortage: production of Pilsener & Urquell beer has been cut by 50% to save grain, & wine imports have almost stopped- but enough beer stocks remain in Germany "to avoid real scarcity for some time." #WW2
1409 2018-02-27 16:41:59 So the stocks are basically all red but bitcoin is flying (sort of)
1410 2018-02-27 16:41:37 I’m hearing obvious: easy fiscal policy means extra pressure on Fed to increase rates and achieve balanced overall policy mix; stocks should be worried
1411 2018-02-27 16:41:03 Can anyone explain to me why the NRA would oppose a ban on bump stocks?  Do they want To encourage mass murders?
1412 2018-02-27 16:41:00 And it's not you to decide what purpose bumb stocks have for others.
1413 2018-02-27 16:40:40 As I said, I don't disagree with banning them. I just think that bump stocks are being used as cover by politicians who do not want to deal with the real issue, which is the fact that AR-15 style weapons are the weapon of choice for massacre killers.
1414 2018-02-27 16:40:39 or because people don't believe banning bump stocks will actually MATTER and it's not a real fix. Stop blaming the NRA for how politicians vote
1415 2018-02-27 16:40:22 Why do you waste so much time  tweeting about this? You are president. Ban assault weapons as well as bump stocks. Do what is right for the children, not what the NRA wants you to do. Be brave.
1416 2018-02-27 16:40:20 Know your stocks so well that you will not be filled with fear if they suddenly drop 50% in price.
1417 2018-02-27 16:39:29 I was a bit overzealous adding “overwhelming”

64% of Americans owned stocks back in 2007. It’s dropped (during those pesky Obama years) to current 52%

Still a majority & I’m sure it’ll pick up again with a businessman (not a taking community organizer) as president

1422 2018-02-27 16:38:12 How in the world can bump stocks be banned?  You won't know someone has one until AFTER a shooting!  Ridiculous, #AGSessions, unless you plan to visit ever gun owner's home daily!
1423 2018-02-27 16:38:04 What's the point in banning 'Bump Stocks' if you're not going to ban assault weapons.  You're gong to ban something that turns a weapon into an assault weapon, not the actual weapon?  Bump Stocks were used in 1 mass shooting?
1424 2018-02-27 16:38:04 Wow do you really think I care if you block me? Trump already put in for a ban on bump stocks.
1425 2018-02-27 16:37:51 Trying to ban bump stocks through regulation could be tied up in court for YEARS. Just another way to pass the buck and avoid taking a vote that would upset the gun lobby. Passing legislation is the ONLY way to get this done NOW. #BanBumpStocks
1426 2018-02-27 16:37:29 Trump said that he was going to try to get rid of the bump stocks, "they don't shoot right because when the bullets come out they just go everywhere in all directions".

1-Why should civilians own semi-auto assault rifles?
2-If bump stocks remain legal, why not legalize full-auto capability?
3-If the gun show loopholes remain, why do do background checks?
4-How important is the right to life?

1434 2018-02-27 16:35:10 Bump stocks serve NO PURPOSE than to give reckless gun owners the ability for fire something with tspeed of automatic w/o avility to aim OR to kill people. Plus accessories are not arms. They are not 2nd amend. If politicians don’t ban, it can ONLY be because of @nra money.
1435 2018-02-27 16:35:05 Paul Ryan clearly doesn’t care about your children’s life.He is coming out to try & support the NRA because Republicans get huge blood money donations from the NRA to do nothing on raising the age to 21, banning bump stocks & Assault Weapons or saving lives of children.

1455 2018-02-27 16:31:59 Banning bump stocks is empty legislature meant to make us ultimately forget about how we need to tighten our system.
1456 2018-02-27 16:31:55 If we banned assault weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines, neither Las Vegas or Parkland would have happened.
1457 2018-02-27 16:31:52 Exactly. It's too many studies that prove tax cuts like what they passed would mean higher taxes later, corps buy stocks back/give more money to execs...and eventually cut jobs
1458 2018-02-27 16:31:43 The 2nd Amendment does NOT allow the Sale or
Ownership of "Weapons of War" ! Assault Rifles, large capacity magazines, bump stocks, are all illegal in the United States! The NRA has lost 3 times in the last 10 yrs to the Supreme Court
because Assault Weapons are "Weapons of War"!
1459 2018-02-27 16:31:21 I don't know the company. By just looking at its chart, I think in short-term the trend is going down. It may find support in $1.45-1.55 level. It will go up and down with all other POT stocks, which I feel they are heading to 200SMA area in the short-term.
1460 2018-02-27 16:30:45 @realDonaldTrump Why don't U spend more TIME stopping or BANNING Illegal Aliens like the ones THAT KILL and break our laws, they kill more of our people than bump stocks do......
1461 2018-02-27 16:30:12 Also above graph does not include wells to wheels emissions for gasoline production or the marginal nature of the worst emitting gasoline stocks (tar sands etc).
1462 2018-02-27 16:29:56 Wrong 
1. The bump stock was outlawed under President Bush in 2005.

2. The Obama Administration reversed this decision legalizing bump stocks in 2010.

3. NO lobbying effort by the NRA, Republicans or conservatives for legalizing bump stocks. This was team Obama's decision
1463 2018-02-27 16:28:58 The fact that any one is fighting to keep military level assault rifles &/or bump stocks on the market is in fact insane. Assault rifles are made to kill humans. They are weapons of war. When people go to war they are shooting humans. Can’t wait to buy nuclear bombs at Walmart!
1464 2018-02-27 16:28:53 BS! Companies are using money to buy back their stocks, enriching only the most wealthy!
1465 2018-02-27 16:28:51 @SpeakerRyan    Parkland Massacre has changed everything . NO MORE NRA BLOOD MONEY . We will tell you what we want , you do as we tell you or look for another job .

1466 2018-02-27 16:28:31 @POTUS Please educate yourself on what a "machine gun" is.  Banning bump-stocks will do NOTHING.  A semi-auto rifle can be bump fired without a bump-stock and that is NOT a machine gun.  You are pandering to the left.  STOP!

Don't believe the media hype. #LasVegasShooterIsAGreatExample #ALittleResearchWouldHelpTheIgnorant #GunGrabbers
1469 2018-02-27 16:27:47 IF that is a universal truth then how do we address situations where no one individual can acquire exclusive ownership rights? A national, regional or global resource that can't be individually owned like forests, lake & ocean fish stocks?
1470 2018-02-27 16:27:46 We distinguish between long base breakouts, short base breakouts, and swing trades from a pullback pattern. Which one has higher success rate? Which one has higher failure rate?  What is our response to this knowledge? #stocks #investing

1477 2018-02-27 16:26:00 Also, while bump stocks do need to be banned, it’s ironic that those of us who know anything about them mostly agree the Vegas incident was probably *less* deadly because that moron used them…

1479 2018-02-27 16:25:19 We need to support small business.  Republicans also need to move on good gun legislation.  We do not need bump stocks, Ak 15’s or any such weapons.  Also increase age to buy weapons, better background checks, mental health help & agencies sharing & working together.
1480 2018-02-27 16:25:06 Also, I’m assuming you didn’t buy a 1st Edition of Margin Of Safety. If you did, the book itself is now the investment... not the stocks you’ll buy after acquiring its knowledge

1483 2018-02-27 16:24:42 WHY are you backing away from on the age limit being raised for gun purchases?  Did you make a deal with your boyfriend, LaPierre?!?  This will not do.  No, we are not suddenly just going to take care of bump stocks and that’s all.

1485 2018-02-27 16:24:23 The corporate taxes have been reduced. Capital gains and dividends taxes are not changing. This is good news for everyone that owns stocks. I suggest you own stocks if you don’t now.
1486 2018-02-27 16:24:22 President Trump needs a win and plays to the center when promising to do away with bump stocks. It is a win win politically and only very few people have them so his gain is bigger than his loss.
1487 2018-02-27 16:23:35 Market Now RIL, Maruti Suzuki among most active stocks in terms of value.
1488 2018-02-27 16:23:25 I hope bump stocks take the fall tbh. The anti gunners will think it's a huge win and we can just pretend to be devastated at the loss of our precious sick operator mod.

1491 2018-02-27 16:23:08 Congrats @SpeakerRyan and @realDonaldTrump on those tax cuts so Corps can buy back stocks and cut jobs just like they said they would before you passed the tax scam.
1492 2018-02-27 16:22:49 Banning bump stocks is for me  an infringement on are unalienable rights. I will not vote 2020 for any anti gun agenda or president nor in 2018 any official that supports this policy.

1496 2018-02-27 16:22:11 Idk maybe they are fun but many bump stocks have been sold and very few to kill people so to assume people by them to kill people is just wrong.

1500 2018-02-27 16:21:50 I'm with you in wishing for lower prices.  Grandma stocks up on groceries when there's a sale.  However, with gold tagging it's 50% retracement of the bull move and the HUI still down over 70% from the all time highs, you must own "some" at these levels imho.
1501 2018-02-27 16:21:46 You can empty a 30-round magazine in less than 15 seconds just pulling the trigger as fast as you can. How much safer are we going to be if we just ban bump stocks? I'm not opposed to banning them, but I think the issue is being used to divert attention from the real issue.
1502 2018-02-27 16:21:43 I thought you'd have a load in buddy. I reckon I'd run out of food way before my booze stocks were gone.
1503 2018-02-27 16:21:39 @realDonaldTrump Did you know bump stocks can be made in a home garage? Maybe do some research. Criminals will make their own. Its a decline in morality that has created evil people. Ban violent videos. See how these kids wanting to ban guns will like that. Age raise will do 0

1506 2018-02-27 16:21:15 A reporter said Trump banning bump stocks is something Obama could never do. Maybe we need to tell Trump banning assault rifles is something Obama couldn’t do.

1511 2018-02-27 16:19:53 @realDonaldTrump I know banning bump stocks "looks good politically" to make the anti gun people shut up. But we know as Gun owners there are other ways to fire without a bump stock. I never had one so I don't care. Ask ur sons about it. I'm sure they know also.

1516 2018-02-27 16:18:50 I’m trying to explain to you that there are actually many former dems and liberals that are changing their minds. Even a small thing like bump stocks could win over a fence-sitter. I want those people. I want Trump for another term.
1517 2018-02-27 16:18:47 It’s unknown if he actually is that rich anymore, he built everything by cheating small businesses, and he managed to do worse with his investments than just leaving them in stocks.

I don't want mentally unstable people to buy a gun. I want sensible laws. The NRA fights everything. That's wrong
1520 2018-02-27 16:18:08 Nope. Decreased hugely under Obama, trend carried on (same as growth and stocks and unemployment etc, all slower than under Obama) for the first year under trump. Black unemployment rose sharply last month though.

1537 2018-02-27 16:13:32 I personally don’t care too much about bump stocks. I think they’re ugly and a waste of ammo, but I’ll never support an out right ban of them. Quid Pro Quo or nothing at all.
1538 2018-02-27 16:13:32 This is only somewhat true, the reason to invest in stocks is because the price will hopefully increase and you'll make money.

1554 2018-02-27 16:11:54 Again, doing what it takes? (rhetoraically?) or running into the school to confront the shooter. Instead of cheap political sarcasm we received a jolt of Trump elevated & excitable yesterday. Do something constructive effective & receptive - sign off on bump stocks & AR’s  –
1555 2018-02-27 16:11:53 Banning bump stocks. Really no need for such an add-on! But banning long guns to those under 21? Ridiculous! So now we are to prevent under 21 from hunting? Military under 21 to buy a rifle? By the way. Not mentioned. Anybody ever hear of AR-15 pistol?  Hahahahaha 
1556 2018-02-27 16:11:52 He did say he's "writing out bump stocks," which is what counts for policy in Trumpland. We'll see if "writing out" means executive order or spelling it out on a scrap of paper that is then shredded and burned, & its existence refuted, despite video footage of the whole process.

1559 2018-02-27 16:11:16 @realDonaldTrump outlaw bump stocks, I agree. I agree with increased age to purchase semiautomatic weapons, AR 15s are not assault weapons they are sporting rifles. Strengthen background checks. Put the responsibility for failure at the feet of those who failed the children.
1560 2018-02-27 16:11:14 We've gone after the NRA and the companies that had connection to the NRA but why aren't we hitting the gun makers?  Do you or anyone you know have stocks in guns?  That is blood money

1590 2018-02-27 16:06:16 Food for though for the PERMA BULLS...

1596 2018-02-27 16:04:57 #FED #stocks @itmtrading_zang @PeterSchiff  "Republican" Royce just asked Fed Chair Powell is raising debt ceiling good because we don't want to not pay our bills....Powell agreed.  Sounds like every Fed Chair just different voice.  We are doomed even under Powell.
1597 2018-02-27 16:04:31 That's unfair. How many Fed level restrictions have passed in the last fifty years?  4 or 5?  Your "slippery slope" is dishonest.  Because it simply hasn't happened.  "Giving an inch" would be limiting magazine size. or bump stocks. or better mental health eval.

1611 2018-02-27 16:00:14 No. I mean, he literally can’t just write a law to ban bump stocks. Because Congress has already addressed gun control, only they can do it. Anything he writes will have no effect...
1612 2018-02-27 16:00:09 If they buy back their stock would that not increase their equity.  Raising the value of all equity instuments i.e. stocks?
So stockholders in that company are enriched.
401k, private investors, pension programs.
What problem?
1613 2018-02-27 16:00:07 NRA might be fighting bump stocks, and they have a right to. Adding a bump stock to a gun is not going to cause me to go shoot innocent people. Limiting the rights of people one piece at a time is a mistake.
1614 2018-02-27 16:00:07 When you're truly in love, missionary ranks right up there with the best.  When you're not, who cares?  Might as well wheel out the stocks and the rack or anything else that does it for you.

1617 2018-02-27 15:59:31 @FoxNews bump stocks are for the older arthritic lone wolfers like vegas shooter- of course trump will ban them, they aren't currently at issue. R's said they'd ban them after vegas and- nothing. we're not fooled over nonsensical fixes. ban AKs, raise to 21yrs & full backgrounds.

1619 2018-02-27 15:58:39 Getting rid of AR-15 , Bump stocks will make a difference. If that teen only had access to a riffle or a hand gun many less people would have died. In Vegas if he only had access to a riffle or a hand gun there would have been less deaths.  It would have made a big difference.
1620 2018-02-27 15:58:29 @realDonaldTrump if you sign bump stock ban, I'm OFF Trump train forever.  I was a STAUNCH supporter but I will turn against you.  I am the NRA, I'm NOT a criminal.  Bump stocks are NOT the problem. The problem is CRIMINALS. Not us. #DefendtheSecond #IAmTheNRA #SecondAmendment
1621 2018-02-27 15:58:26 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Don't know if this has been considered re:bump stocks ;however, NFA has an "Other" classification that fits the bump stock without having to redefine an automatic weapon. Just a thought.
1622 2018-02-27 15:58:05 The problem is it’s really hard to word a bill to ban bum stocks. Very arbitrary device.
1623 2018-02-27 15:57:56 Sure. My own way would be to put offending pupils in the stocks and pelt them with durian fruit. Only kidding. They could stand if they wanted.

1636 2018-02-27 15:55:55 There is a lot of debate over whether an AR-15 is actually an assault weapon. Looking intimidating is not a criteria used to determine this.

1646 2018-02-27 15:53:27 There is a huge difference. Using a bump stock you can approach full auto cyclic rate, but at the expense of accuracy. I'm a gun owner, but I think banning bump stocks would be a good idea.

1655 2018-02-27 15:51:55 .  Our young people can join the armed services and protect our country at 18, they should have a right to responsibly own a gun.  Automatic, semi-automatic, and devices like bump stocks should be banned.  We have gun laws - we need to enforce them
1656 2018-02-27 15:51:51 Let us not be lemmings and go over the cliff. Rational thinking should guide us to the appropriate measures to address the issue of mass shootings. Raise age to 21 to purchase a firearm. Outlaw bump stocks. Enhance BR Checks. Screen everyone entering schools.
1657 2018-02-27 15:51:48 Alright so then why don’t we have a law on the books banning assault weapons or bump stocks? Can’t enforce anything that’s not there....
1658 2018-02-27 15:51:22 Teachers do not want to be armed in schools . We need to ban assault weapons, ban bump stocks, have stricter background checks, and provide better mental health services where needed. Revealing non-compliant schools would make them sitting ducks. Better to to fund improvements.

1662 2018-02-27 15:50:39 It's deeply disappointing that the GOP/NRA refuse to ban bump stocks - the sole purpose of which is to mimic full automatic fire.

It's deeply disappointing that the GOP/NRA refuses to limit magazine/clip sizes (which serve no purpose for hunting, but can slow a mass shooter).

1668 2018-02-27 15:49:45 I believe that bump stocks should be banned.  However, it doesn't keep someone from turning a semi-auto into full auto, it's simple as filing certain internal parts of the weapon down to become fully automatic.

1718 2018-02-27 15:39:29 U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Tuesday the Justice Department will be ready soon to announce a decision on bump stocks, and hinted that the department's lawyers believe the device can be banned through new regulations.

@TheEconomist
1782 2018-02-27 15:22:13 Your President supports banning bump stocks, universal background checks for all gun purchases, raising the age for semi automatic rifles to 21, AND making it easier for law enforcement to seize guns from  people like N. Cruz. He said all if this recently. Should he not be here?

1785 2018-02-27 15:21:17 @POTUS 
1. You’ve held your listening sessions 
2. The NRA is FOR banning bump stocks 
3. The 2nd Amendment says “a well regulated militia”  
Therefore as 1st steps:
1 . Ban bumpstocks now 
2. Undo your weakening of access to firearms by mentally ill

1820 2018-02-27 15:12:20 AR-15 is built 2 be light w/ plastic furniture (stocks) etc. Maybe 8#. It also has a light recoil because the bullet is fairly lightweight. You'd find it very comfortable.

1836 2018-02-27 15:08:39 The debate is not limited to just the AR-15, if we make that mistake they will give us a bill that appears to limit what can be done with the AR -15, such as bump stocks. It's more than one particular type of gun. It's about violence in our society, where guns are used to kill!

1840 2018-02-27 15:07:50 Go get Blackrock!  They secretly buy gun stocks/shares. They say they want to be socially responsible. Make them put the heat on the nra or gun manufacturers.
1841 2018-02-27 15:07:48 You are right they would still not be safe but it is a step. We need to ban magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. We need to ban bump stocks. Think of it this way, Your guns will be worth more money
1842 2018-02-27 15:07:38 Banning bump stocks won’t do any good. It’s a feel good tactic they are pulling.
1843 2018-02-27 15:07:38 Thanks God for robinhood and betterment. Little guy like me can buy stocks and plan my retirement by myself 
1844 2018-02-27 15:06:58 Your ignorance on this issue is astounding, congressman. Obama's ATF determined that they have no power to regulate bump stocks. Please take an early retirement, you're an embarrassment to your constituents.

1848 2018-02-27 15:05:56 Just a vent here, I watch the news and see everyone talking about gun control, yes I agree the age should be changed, bump stocks gone, but what I'm not hearing is why the psychiatrists won't call the authority's, they will not break the hippa laws as long within the scope

Did you hear Nancy Pelosi say banning bump stocks would be a good start?

I don't think I need a bump stock but I don't think I want to open the door that will lead to gun confiscation.

1856 2018-02-27 15:03:34 you did not answer the question. The NRA has a strangle hold on the House and Senate even in this climate they are balking. Big banks are now dropping gun stocks. This is a real thing. Answer my question

1859 2018-02-27 15:03:03 Trump does not intend to do anything.  He could work with Congress and have a bill on the floor tomorrow to outlaw bump stocks, or raise the age to 21, or close gunshow loophole. Like "I love DACA recipients" this too is BS. If anything gets done it will be despite Trump.

1862 2018-02-27 15:02:04 After Las Vegas the Prez couldn’t say a word about banning bump stocks.  But now that a lot of children are taking the lead on gun control (after their friends died in an incident where bump stocks were NOT used), he’s all over the ATF to “consider limiting” them...
1863 2018-02-27 15:01:54 Ban import of all semi-automatic weapons, and then follow it up with #BanSemiAutos. Enough of the silly arguments over what is and is not an assault weapon. If it is semi-auto, ban it. They are too easy to modify (ex: easily built bump stocks) and add extra magazine capacity to.
1864 2018-02-27 15:01:37 In Momentum, your strategy goes to Cash. Does that mean Zero Momentum Stocks available? Nahi na?
1865 2018-02-27 15:01:25 You keep saying "natural rights" but the two words together defy logic.
"Natural" is when u take a piss, "Rights" dictate where ur allowed to piss.
Its just as much ur right to own bump stocks as it is for californians to own weed, but neither rights are in the constitution.
1866 2018-02-27 15:01:16 It looks inexpensive. I always look at it compared to some of the big stocks and what they earn, what $KL earned, and I just think that there's a lot of examples where we look a lot cheaper than some that are trading at 2 and 3 times higher multiples than we're trading. - Sprott

1868 2018-02-27 15:00:26 @realDonaldTrump I believe that any Bump Stock legislation should include homemade and improvised devise. Bump stocks were not invented they evolved.

1871 2018-02-27 14:59:58 Well, just last week he took out his pen and phone and ordered Jeff Sessions to ban bump stocks through regulations even though the Obama ATF said they didn't have the legal authority to do so

1873 2018-02-27 14:59:28 I think we need to be careful with the wording of TTFI to make sure the dividends of stocks of foreign companies/corporations that have a dual listing on a U.S. exchange are not deemed U.S. income.
1874 2018-02-27 14:59:18 The @NRA says they don't support a legislative ban on bump stocks.

An administrative regulation of bump stocks has 2 major shortcomings:

1) it can be overturned with the stroke of a pen.
2) it will be more susceptible to court challenges.
 Congress must do their job!

1880 2018-02-27 14:58:01 The point is more in depth background checks, licensing and proof of knowledge of use and safety requirements.  A ban on bump stocks, and assault rifles.  There is no movement to repeal the 2nd amendment.  How is that point not clear?!

Btw, Trump gave away the game yesterday, claiming he'll ban and make it very hard to get bump stocks. That shows restrictions work.

1908 2018-02-27 14:53:03 They can do gun control, it is not hard. Ban assault rifles, very high tax on bullets, give money to schools for mental illness, Ban bump stocks, raise age limit.  It is easy.  Don't make excuses too many  people are dead because of guns.
1909 2018-02-27 14:52:49 I started this thread stating bump stocks should be illegal. Why can't you accept that we agree on something?

Magazine sizes don't make much difference so it's stupid to regulate. It's like passing a law that cars must have gas tanks smaller than 5 gallons to stop drunk driving.
1910 2018-02-27 14:52:34 So they ban them but what happens to all the bump stocks already purchased? They sold out on websites after Vegas. Do you just get a ticket or arrested if caught with one?
1911 2018-02-27 14:52:23 Hey Hogg or should I say hog I think the NRA members should short sell the stocks in those companies that did away with the companies that did away with the NRA discounts then buy fed ex also do what Georgia's doing take away delta's tax incentives
1912 2018-02-27 14:52:19 Six months ago it was “bump stocks”

I’m not going to lie. When I first heard “bump stocks”, I went to CNN Money to see what these investments were.
1913 2018-02-27 14:52:11 Stocks that do buybacks are "value" stocks... and value has way underperformed growth in this bull market.

1921 2018-02-27 14:50:59 Take bump stocks for instance.  We know it nearly makes an AK and automatic.  If we ban them, there are similar accessories that will do the same.  What are your thoughts on magazine capacities?  Just curious.
1922 2018-02-27 14:50:52 We all grieve the loss of lives,raising the age to buy guns to 21 is reasonable as is banning bumps stocks.Scare tactics to strip Law abiding citizens of any freedom is wrong.We don't need George Bush Tactics.

1929 2018-02-27 14:49:46 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!

1938 2018-02-27 14:48:32 I thought ATF greenlighted bump stocks under Obama.  Oh yeah.  I forgot the executive power disappeared after Trump took office.
1939 2018-02-27 14:48:28 So-what are YOU going to do to "solve the problem"? Any proposals to limit ownership to 21+? What about banning bump stocks? what about banning new AR-15s? "ASSAULT" rifles - assault means killing people!

1944 2018-02-27 14:47:45 Bump stocks were approved by the ATF to allow those with limited mobility to use a firearm. It allowed manufacturers to make products that mimicked previously improvised solutions (for instance, hooking a digit through a belt loop). It's also an ADA related issue.

1948 2018-02-27 14:47:15 Sensible ... for starters
1) No semi-automatic weapons for general public (military and law enforcement only)
2) No bump-stocks
3) All guns must be sold thru licensed retailer -- mandatory background check and mental assessment for every sale

1952 2018-02-27 14:46:43 #TaxScamBill gave wealthy giant tax cut. Corporations got massive cuts, which they use to buy back stocks. This drives up markets.

1953 2018-02-27 14:46:31 Mr. President, protect your voters from gun control, don't enact any. Leave bump stocks alone.
1954 2018-02-27 14:46:31 What good is banning bump stocks if high capacity magazines are still available? Package deal ban both please.
1955 2018-02-27 14:46:26 Not a fan of bump stocks but I'm viewing this ban as a lazy grab for low hanging fruit that will not make a difference other than appease the anti gun crowds. Does nothing to deter a murderous psychopath.

1960 2018-02-27 14:45:52 No matter the outcome I don‘t care, I trade without emotions(at least I try to). I know my risk and my reward. I entered with a 2/1 Reward to risk ratio, if this trade doesn’t work the next will. It‘s a marathon, not a sprint. #trading #stocks #money
1961 2018-02-27 14:45:25 @sambehr yeah, I’d say you’d be better off looking elsewhere for undervalued stocks. Amazon can only get bigger with macroecon situation.

“You need to respecify it, I’m afraid.”
“Perhaps, titani... “
“No, sir. Adamantium isn’t available either.”

1968 2018-02-27 14:43:43 Stocks open slightly higher after Powell remarks
1969 2018-02-27 14:43:41 If the Obama ATF could have banned bump stocks by regulation, don't you think they would have?
1970 2018-02-27 14:43:33 Ban rocks with bump stocks!
1971 2018-02-27 14:43:11 A shame it took kids dying to get the conversation about bump stocks restarted.
1972 2018-02-27 14:43:09 Pot stocks are tanking I love it, hoping to free up some money from my tech stocks to invest more into cannabis if they continue on this downward trend
1973 2018-02-27 14:43:05 "Not while Republicans are in control. The president has spoken about raising the age limit for the purchase of assault rifles to 21, along with a ban on so-called bump stocks, which are devices that help increase the rate of fire"
1974 2018-02-27 14:42:25 Well pot stocks look like they will be on life support today. Waiting and watching...for reentry but it might be a while.
1975 2018-02-27 14:42:19 I got 4 hours of sleep I am up early day trading stocks #stocks
1976 2018-02-27 14:41:50 I'm STRONGLY FOR gun control & AGAINST assault rifles but high capacity mags aren't the problem, We need to focus on the type of weapon, ammo such as armor-piercing/hollow point & bump stocks. You can kill just as fast with 10 shot mags as u can with a 100 shot mag if you're good
1977 2018-02-27 14:41:43 No one is innocent at the Auto de Fe. The best you can hope for is tar and feathering, a couple weeks in the stocks.
1978 2018-02-27 14:41:39 If it makes people feel better, let's ban "Bump Stocks". For the people who don't know, that does not ban the 6 point foldable stock. Which is a totally different Stock but the one they show. That Stock is for comfort of the Legal Buyer. Know the Difference!#gunsense #Truth
1979 2018-02-27 14:41:35 the argument from GOPeahearts that banning assault rifles won’t have any effect but banning bump stocks will.... 
1980 2018-02-27 14:41:20 A recent paper says that except for the smallest stocks, the value premium is weak.
1981 2018-02-27 14:41:02 Right, using the regulatory process ensures that no action will be taken for years. If they passed a bill, bump stocks could be illegal tomorrow. This whole thing is to create the illusion of action.
1982 2018-02-27 14:40:48 #WHATIF We banned the sale of assault rifles and BUMP STOCKS in the US?
1983 2018-02-27 14:40:40 And that's the elephant in the room, not bump stocks, clips, semi auto, etc......... So tired of this!!!!
1984 2018-02-27 14:40:40 We outlawed sawed off shotguns. This is gun alteration. ..bump stocks should be lillegal.
1985 2018-02-27 14:40:26 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1986 2018-02-27 14:40:24 You aren't fooling anyone..NRA is not for making bump stocks illegal (they want regulatory ban vs criminalization), and they have traditionally fault red flag laws, expansion of Brady laws.     Quit gaslighting us please.

1990 2018-02-27 14:39:36 @realDonaldTrump "If congress doesn't act, I will.". You sound just as bad as Obama with your talk about bump stocks. With all of your time on the internet being on Twitter, maybe you should browse other parts of the net to see that a stock is not needed... (1)
1991 2018-02-27 14:39:36 Ken Paxton is a smart man if Trump understood that bump stocks are not killing people you have to arm good citizens period people can make bump stocks in there garage let's get to the root of the problem not more worthless laws in Washington hell these killers make bombs
1992 2018-02-27 14:39:36 US stocks actually looking strong again. If we clear low 26k's we should be on track for new ATHs
1993 2018-02-27 14:39:27 Your headline is confusing. He's saying he won't stop his Corp's money managers from investing in gun co stocks, which is unfortunate, but at least we now know the limit of his sometimes good intentions is "profits" at all societal costs.
1994 2018-02-27 14:38:48 @realDonaldTrump Sir. Removing Bump Stocks, a piece of plastic and springs will not effect a sick person set on doing harm. A criminal will always find a weapon, legal or not.
Legal gun owners respect ownership and rights and don't use guns to harm, only protect.

If you attack bump stocks, or anything else gun related, you will begin a series of events you do not want to happen... People are going to fight
2014 2018-02-27 14:34:22 Who has the most knowledge about weapons available? Who is lobbying group which focuses on weapon regulation and ability of individuals to get weapons? Who was aware of bump stocks and other weapons that could be used to murder in volume? The NRA. The politicians and government
2015 2018-02-27 14:33:55 #Day361 mr @realDonaldTrump, why did U send the #ObamaWiretapTweets? Why won't U release your taxes? Why didn't U push for banning bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting?
2016 2018-02-27 14:33:45 Why don't people sobbing about bump stocks understand that bump firing can be done without one. It's literally just holding the gun and pulling forward on the stock enough that the recoil relaxes the pressure on the trigger. It's not even all that difficult to do.

2020 2018-02-27 14:32:45 Sessions has been too busy the past 4 months chasing pot smokers, to be bothered with bump stocks.
2021 2018-02-27 14:32:17 Have to disagree, then. I can't see why Norway Sov Fund would divest oil stocks; World Bank cut lending to oil development; Aramco IPO etc etc if any of them see upward oil price trend. Ergo cap.

2024 2018-02-27 14:31:34 They buy most of the air time in ads. Nobody wants to lose the money. Plus most have invested interest in Big Pharm stocks. They would be shooting themselves in the foot if they expose.
2025 2018-02-27 14:31:28 When P/E ratios are considered in valuing blue chip bank stocks, how will the migration of assets from banks to decentralized blockchains affect these stock prices? Is every dollar of profit erosion multiplied through the P/E ratio to the stock price?

2036 2018-02-27 14:26:57 This said I do believe people should have access to weapons that are NOT Semi Automatic or Automatic. I don’t think they should have access to high volume mags of any kind, stripper clips, bump stocks, modification kits ect.
2037 2018-02-27 14:26:52 I’ve been having people come over my house in the morning the past month so I can teach them how to trade stocks & what to look for in the market.
2038 2018-02-27 14:26:42 You should probably do some research before you go posting accusations like that.  Pres. Trump did not evade the draft and is owned by no one or no company..check out his bill on bump stocks.  You're being used as a tool kid and looking like a fool.
2039 2018-02-27 14:26:15 @shannonrwatts They are working on the bill, you need to stop watching liberal media CNN/MSNBC they will never report the facts. The bill is in the works to ban bump stocks.
2040 2018-02-27 14:26:11 I beg to disagree. One gets too excited too early. He is an opener, and our stocks including back ups are full. If he replaced say x, it will be tweeted that he is hard done by.

2051 2018-02-27 14:24:26 It's the same body language he used a few days back when he said he was going to ban bump stocks and raise gun purchase age to 21. "You can make me say it but you can't make me like it". Like signing the Ruskie sanctions. There was arm twisting involved...

2058 2018-02-27 14:22:46 They do not want to take your guns.  You are smarter than that, aren’t you?  We want better background checks, 21 age limit, no bump stocks and no weapons used for wars...like the AR15.  Again, we don’t want your guns.  We have guns too.
2059 2018-02-27 14:21:22 he has stated he wants to ban bump stocks and talking about raising the age to buy some weapons, so that's what he is doing but don't let facts stop you, you never had, and no one believes any polls from the bias media and those were the ones that said Hillary would win
2060 2018-02-27 14:20:53 @realDonaldTrump good morning mr. President I mean I don't know a whole lot about bump stocks I don't have one I really don't need one my finger works pretty damn good if I needed to but why outlaw them it's not the weapons weapons don't kill it's the people behind them
2061 2018-02-27 14:20:48 @CaseyCagle I am GOP & gun owner. @Delta & others bus must get the @NRA’s attention bc of NRA’s hardline stance.

2065 2018-02-27 14:18:57 I disagree a stock dump would have dimished the value of their stocks significantly. This is how liberals think. If the stock would have crashed the people have spoken. Stock goes up, normal market fluctuations. This is why most liberal talk goes in the used diaper category.
2066 2018-02-27 14:18:43 There were some good college hoops on last night. These next few weeks will be amazing. Stocks up on beer and other necessities.
2067 2018-02-27 14:18:35 Ah well. They’re all just laughing stocks at this point anyway.
2068 2018-02-27 14:18:16 I'm still not convinced that freedom means we have the right to own and distribute bump stocks. But that's just me
2069 2018-02-27 14:18:10 So she's more interested in being self egrandising than banning bump stocks.  She wants full credit or it'll get held up.  No wonder she didn't get her party's full support.
2070 2018-02-27 14:18:02 Trump is (acting) like he getting strict with assault guns by banning bump stocks & training some teachers to protect our children-He's Only found a way to remain Loyal to the NRA.  The Only Right Action is to Renew the 10 year Ban on assault guns that expired in 2004 !!!
2071 2018-02-27 14:17:41 Ban bump stocks all you want, but people can just make their own if they want one badly enough; Banning them will have very little effect.

2073 2018-02-27 14:17:07 #Stocks,#Indexes Perspective, insights: that NDX alone bottom-signaled the most recent rally (upleg) and did not top-signal. This, along with accumulating observations going back many weeks, evidence the increasing relative dominance of NDX.

2078 2018-02-27 14:15:30 Good, glad they're not stricken with some sort of pathological altruism. Buying back stocks is helping everyone's 401k, and that's ignoring the widespread bonuses and pay raises many companies are giving.  These are GOOD things.

2083 2018-02-27 14:13:27 After the lunch, Trump backed off his threat to sign an ex.order banning bump stocks. The NRA owns Trump. They're all corrupt frauds.
2084 2018-02-27 14:13:23 How many loons will say "No bump stocks?  Well then I'll end my maniacal thoughts of killing!"  Ya think?
2085 2018-02-27 14:13:09 @POTUS If you fought for raising age limits, banning assault style weapons and bump stocks, you would be draining the swamp and be perceived as strong and, concerned about youth. It would be a very popular move.
2086 2018-02-27 14:13:05 And what does he mean by gun control? Banning all guns? Just AR15s? Bump stocks? When will David Hogg be satisfied enough to go back to school?
2087 2018-02-27 14:13:02 Auto stocks like Maruti declined 1% to close at Rs8891 on account of profit booking. Tech stocks like TCS, Infosys, Hexaeware and HCL Tech bounced back into positive territory.

2089 2018-02-27 14:12:52 I believe Trump is right here, there is nothing to be afraid of. Bump stocks should have never been allowed, and there is no reason for kids to buy any type long gun. There military age thing is a joke, you either join or you don't! Same thing with hi cap mags, no need for them.

2104 2018-02-27 14:10:17 1. Ban bump stocks
2. Ban high capacity magazines
3. Ban armor-piercing bullets

6. Require 3 day waiting period for purchase
7. Fix background check system

2107 2018-02-27 14:09:38 I have no issue with bumpstocks if that makes people feel safer. As they do modify rate of fire. Although the same can be accomplished with a belt loop if a shooter is so inclined. And there has only been 1 use of bump-stocks. But again. I’m fine with that.
2108 2018-02-27 14:09:36 This kid andCooper are both idiots!  I’m sick of hearing about bump stocks! I don’t have one nor do I need one but they should be happy the guy in Vegas used one because it saved lives!  It reduces accuracy dramatically.  Without a bump stock he could have killed several hundred!

2112 2018-02-27 14:08:11 Hey tough guy, maybe a good place to start would be banning bump stocks and changing gun laws to keep military grade weapons out of the hands of citizens
2113 2018-02-27 14:08:08 when i started it was a bear market and i was still experimenting on my trading methods. wala pa yun bear market, but if you are pertaining to a down market yes momentum stocks can still lead the way
2114 2018-02-27 14:08:08 I must have missed Trump's Executive Order on bump stocks. Usurping the legislature was no problem for him before.
2115 2018-02-27 14:07:47 Thank you for bringing attention to Trumps proposal to ban bump stocks

2120 2018-02-27 14:07:05 I believe in the background checks, I believe in more funding for mental health.
I believe in removing bump stocks . The amount of red flags missed is unbelievable.( FBI, tips 30 plus visits)To avoid making this main part of the conversation and just talking about banning guns 
2121 2018-02-27 14:06:51 Bump stocks are not necessary to easily bump fire a Semi-Auto weapon they are just a accessory for bragging rights. Trumps promise is to save face and still make no changes & why the NRA supports it. Significant regulations & banning semi-auto & Auto weapons is the only solution
2122 2018-02-27 14:06:49 I really appreciate your comment about retired people being all in on stocks because they ‘have no choice’. We are doing that, although we do have about 32% bonds. It has me thinking! I do agree with your assessment that bull isn’t over. But not wise to try time bonds I guess.
2123 2018-02-27 14:06:25 Obama's ATF approved bump stocks for sale.   It stands to reason that Trump's ATF could revisit and reverse that.
2124 2018-02-27 14:06:23 Yes. NRA fights for the right to own and use semi-automatic weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Are these used for hunting animals or people?
2125 2018-02-27 14:06:05 Sanders states that the President has signed an order to ban bump stocks. #MJSpring18
2126 2018-02-27 14:05:16 Banks and realty  stocks witnessed sharp losses. Metal shares declined.

2135 2018-02-27 14:03:35 Obviously the NRA gave Trump the OK on Bump Stocks at lunch.

In return he must drop the age requirement talk.

He was then told to continue distracting us by talking about arming teachers, and blaming law enforcement so we stop talking about Assault Weapons Ban

NRA Puppet
2136 2018-02-27 14:03:27 You fail to mention that the president supports a national ban on bump stocks.

2152 2018-02-27 13:59:37 “The NRA has said it could support a bump stock ban by regulation, as Trump proposes, but not a new law.”

Two questions: 

How can anyone possibly be debating the banning of bump stocks? 

And, we remain aware that the NRA doesn’t actually hold office, right?

2154 2018-02-27 13:58:55 Did he or did he not say it? The answer is he did. We could put a bill in front of Congress banning bump stocks, raising the minimum age and creating stronger background checks and the Dems will vote against it because they have to resist. Then they will say Trump did nothing.

2208 2018-02-27 13:35:48 And not a single person is here to ban all guns. Obviously that’s not feasible, and is another straw man. Banning bump stocks and specific guns, however, is 100% possible, or regulations allowing for a digital database.
2209 2018-02-27 13:35:18 Donc soit je fini mes stocks de Stevia et de sucralose dégueus, soit je m'adapte et je bois moins(pas) sucré... Mais je vais pas acheter un autre truc pour au final peut être même pas le boire  Merci quand même !!
2210 2018-02-27 13:34:43 So kinder surprise eggs they can ban, but not bump stocks?? Seems like they could get round this one
2211 2018-02-27 13:34:40 Assault weapons are not more dangerous than non assault weapons,the VPC admitted it was just a stepping stone for more strict controls.  You have to be mentally deficient to think the ban did anything.  Do you have experience with AR15s and semi autos with wood classic stocks?

2215 2018-02-27 13:33:57 Sweetheart, You are the last person from whom I would rely on investment advice.          Kurt Eichenwald   @kurteichenwald             In preparation for a completely unpredictable Trump presidency, I sold all stocks in my kids' education accounts today. I urge u to do same.
2216 2018-02-27 13:33:37 Considering that that 1% pays my paycheck, has given me a raise, is investing in my company and buying stocks that raise stock prices thus raising my 401(k) (Doubled over the last year by the way) I would say they are giving me plenty.
2217 2018-02-27 13:33:33 Snow actually touched the ground in Windsor earlier. I can already hear the locals rushing to Waitrose to build emergency stocks of foie gras.
2218 2018-02-27 13:33:26 This is a bump stock, all rifle stocks can be changed.
2219 2018-02-27 13:33:19 Ban Assault weapons. Jeez, bump stocks?  Is that the best you can do?

2225 2018-02-27 13:31:40 Dems new bill will ban all semi autos with detachable magazines and shotguns with pistol grip stocks. How can anybody think they want to ban guns.
2226 2018-02-27 13:31:24 Germany must be one of the countries with the most risk-averse people. The common perception is that "stocks are too risky" and the financial markets are publicly seen as some kind of gambling vehicle in which only gamblers participate.

2232 2018-02-27 13:30:23 My predictions for federal laws:

2. Ban sales of assault rifles. NOPE
3. Expand background investigations to buyers at gun shows & online.  NOPE
4. NICS Fix. MAYBE

2235 2018-02-27 13:29:05 Apparently over 60% of fund management professionals have < 8 years market experience – which means they haven’t seen bond bear markets, liquidity ice-storms, or genuine fear in stocks. We can warn about them – much like the authorities did about last night’s non-blizzard
2236 2018-02-27 13:28:57 @davidhogg111 a BIG THANK YOU for letting us know to 'BUY' FED-EX STOCKS.  you're a gem!  btw....we even bought memberships to the NRA.
2237 2018-02-27 13:28:10 Re this fishing nonsense, we share thats everyone our fishing grounds. UK likes to catch cod, haddock so we share fishing grounds with Iceland and Norway. Yes nothing is perfect and we nearly reduced Cod stocks to zero. So some management must happen.
2238 2018-02-27 13:27:59 A ban of bump stocks, universal background checks & raising the age to 21 could be attainable but as always the Dems want everything and they will get nothing. Then they explain to David Hogg and beg forgivness

2242 2018-02-27 13:27:23 Uh...nobody is banning all guns. We can't even get assault weapons banned, used to mow down crowds of kids. Or bump stocks. Or get universal background checks. Or required training in gun use & storage.

2250 2018-02-27 13:24:02 I think to a degree that is because white collar crime is not always as visible. Fraud in the currency markets or stocks is less easy for the average joe to understand. Benefit cheats people can see neighbours doing it in front of their eyes.

2254 2018-02-27 13:23:45 I'm thinking about just abandoning my fairly reasonable stance of being okay with a bump stock ban (as long as it's only bump stocks!) and even with more extensive background checks.

Simply because if you give the left a finger, they take not just the hand, but the whole body.
2255 2018-02-27 13:23:19 Not defending bump stocks but this gun appears to be fully automatic, which is already illegal. Report this guy.
2256 2018-02-27 13:23:17 I am confused by people who say they are pro life but also support high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. 
2257 2018-02-27 13:23:11 Any chance that the index trackers (BlacRock, etc) will push the index providers to drop these stocks from the major indices?
2258 2018-02-27 13:22:54 Yea, I don't see any value to bump stocks, other than to mimic a fully automatic.  As horrible as mass shootings like this last one & the Texas church are, gun ownership is still at an all time high, while gun violence still dropping, and long gun homicides are rare
2259 2018-02-27 13:22:35 If stocks fall, a flight to safety in bonds and resulting lower yields are also a possibility, correct?

2267 2018-02-27 13:20:46 Well you did a great job! The main thing to understand about gun owners is they are concerned about death by a thousand slices — long term strategies work this way. It’s AR15 and bump stocks today and hand guns tomorrow.
2268 2018-02-27 13:20:44 Until I see a bill that Trump signs that gets rid of bump stocks, he is full of utter refuse and complete and total lies.

2270 2018-02-27 13:19:31 The whole thing is meaningless, banning bump stocks would do nothing to slow carnage. Any semi automatic or automatic weapon must be banned.
2271 2018-02-27 13:19:27 There is no gunshow loophole  that's a myth, and a lie. Calling ARsenal "assault weapons" is a misleading statement, bump stocks aren't the problem. Lock up lunatics the way they used to be, that's a better solution.

2286 2018-02-27 13:15:27 Um yeah, I am aware that Trump is making bump stocks illegal and good on him for it. I’m also aware that that is about as far as he will go when it comes to gun regulations besides the idea of raising the age on gun purchases. These are all solid ideas but he isn’t going to make+
2287 2018-02-27 13:15:13 I see. Is the definition a video? My point was this: even if there was/is a definition in words someone will disagree We became aware of " bump stocks " after Las Vegas.

2295 2018-02-27 13:11:56 Let me get this straight. With Trump's Tax Cuts in Hand corps are raising wages, giving bonuses, building, expanding, hiring, repatriating money AND buying back stocks thereby increasing stock prices which benefits working Americans and this is a bad thing?
2296 2018-02-27 13:11:27 The spin that is coming from this White House and GOP showing that they'll do something about gun violence will be ridiculous. Trump will boast voraciously about killing bump stocks, that he fought an amazing fight with the NRA and won. Then nothing else will happen. Just wait.

2317 2018-02-27 13:03:34 You might want to add "bump stocks" to your research.

A simple, inexpensive device that is perfectly legal, which effectively converts a semi automatic to fire like a fully automatic.

Donald Trump says he wants to ban them.
2318 2018-02-27 13:02:44 Problem is that most anti-gun proposals lack common sense.  Join @realDonaldTrump's call for expanded background checks, elimination of bump stocks and raising the age limit on ARs.  Don't let your Trump hate prevent making our kids safer. @NRA
2319 2018-02-27 13:02:22 There you go. Make statements that you can't prove. He literally gave statements saying he wants to ban bump stocks, raise the age to buy a rifle and make background checks more difficult. That's way more than Obama came up with. You're an idiot too.

2323 2018-02-27 13:01:08 There is not one word he said that is untruthful. He can “ban” bump stocks. The question is whether it would be ruled constitutional or not. Knowing the rabid Left, they’ll probably join the NRA to fight it just bc it’s Trump; whereas the Left would praise Obama for such a stmt.

2331 2018-02-27 12:59:38 ❃ Low-income people and other persons mentioned in law and in need of a home shall receive it gratis or for reasonable payment from the state, municipal and other housing stocks according to the norms fixed by law.
2332 2018-02-27 12:59:37 @JoeSquawk @andrewrsorkin @BeckyQuick #CNBC Strategy [IGNITE]: @WarrenBuffett likes #airlines. Managing one is another part. I love airlines & own #stock. My goals are prevalent. Soaring to the #sky is a destination. Warren buys $AAL, why don't you. 
Ready for airline stocks?

2334 2018-02-27 12:58:39 Should have told him that IF @realDonaldTrump would just get Congress to get rid of the Volcker Rule so that banks could support stocks in volatile times (what they're supposed to do) - companies wouldnt need to piss away money on buybacks
2335 2018-02-27 12:57:22 Personalmente me mola mas el tradicional. El simple hecho de tener que echar a todos los jugadores que puedas antes de que te eliminen a ti le da un toque diferente, aparte que te da mas hype si has quitado muchas stocks xD
2336 2018-02-27 12:57:16 Please visit the store today, we have received 5A stocks. You will get it from there. Thanks
2337 2018-02-27 12:55:25 While I applaud everything you have accomplished,I am asking you to get your facts straight. The AR-15 is NOT a military grade weapon.  The age restrictions is a good start, ban bump stocks, and high capacity magazines, mental health checks, Social media sweep
2338 2018-02-27 12:55:00 (7) As for Trump being "owned by the NRA," I guess you missed Trump announcing today that bump-fire stocks will be banned.

Are you aware of the NRA's position on bump-fire stocks, David?

Bump stocks don't kill people...guns don't kill people...violent nutjobs and incompetent law enforcement with 39 reports kill people.

2364 2018-02-27 12:42:57 Assault weapons, high capacity magazine clips and bump stocks are all intended to kill as many people in as little time possible. The NRA has done nothing to encourage their ban. You do your research.

1. Strengthen background checks.
2. Ban assault weapons. 
3. Ban bump stocks and the like.

In our current one however, our votes (discretionary income) have been removed through centralized control of money, finance, stocks, insurance, business funding, etc. A #UBI proportionally reverses that, giving back power.
2408 2018-02-27 12:20:10 Unfortunately, home made bump stocks are easy to make.  Give banning bump stocks a try, but criminals don't care about laws.  

It's a human problem.  Solve it and you won't need gun control, police, military, or criminal laws.
2409 2018-02-27 12:20:05 Trump's tax cuts have been in place a few weeks, so your "best year selling houses" is unrelated.

2417 2018-02-27 12:16:35 Probably part of some deal made with the NRA at their cozy lunch recently. "We'll ban bump stocks, make the people think we're really doing something..." He probably promised his dear friends he could make this all go away, so they'll go along with the ban while he plays hero.
2418 2018-02-27 12:16:14 Republicans know he’s just paying lip service with his talk of bump stocks, age limits, etc...anyone that believes he’s doing more than that, hasn’t payed attention to Trump or the GOP.

2421 2018-02-27 12:13:56 Except he's outright infringing on a God given or Natural right.  I hope he's bluffing, but if he goes through with it, he's toast in 2020.  The existing gun laws are bad enough, and these stocks fell within the purview of those laws

2447 2018-02-27 11:56:07 News flash . . Delta can just move out of Georgia to Texas, or Tennessee or Ohio or any other state they freakin' feel like!!!  Nobody said to take anyone's guns away, just raise the age to 21 to own one and ban "bump stocks" !!!!!!!!!!!!!
2448 2018-02-27 11:53:56 A mí también me gustó mucho el estilo japonés porque, tratándose de un formato competitivo como es la partida de 3 stocks no nos podemos encontrar con un Ditto Sonic que dure +12 minutos, por ejemplo.
2449 2018-02-27 11:53:47 Nice, by the way would you please give an idea where to get the NSE 500 stocks list for the last 15 years. I have googled a lot, but could not find a single useful link.
2450 2018-02-27 11:53:36 Your casting between performance or tactical is a moot point.
Upgrades that are needed to effectively hunt humans are to be regulated.
A 100 round mag, barrel cooling, bump stocks are not needed.
2451 2018-02-27 11:51:12 European stocks and bonds slipped as investors await the first public comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday. Treasuries steadied and the dollar was little changed.

2454 2018-02-27 11:49:44 #neveragain DT will ban bump stocks "himself". Does our moron-in-chief know that a bump stock was not used in FLA? When Vegas happened he chose not 2 act on them but will do it now. Idiot!
2455 2018-02-27 11:49:08 C'mon, conservatives... why do you still pretend to care what the stock market does? We know you're full of shit. Stocks go up, you give Trump credit, stocks go down, you pretend they don't really matter. Guess you're just practicing for the next crash, eh?

2458 2018-02-27 11:48:17 Nearly 40 stocks hit fresh 52-week lows on NSE #Market
2459 2018-02-27 11:45:39 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to improve your EDS
2460 2018-02-27 11:44:53 And I also sold all my @amazon stocks.  If anyone have Amazon stocks please sell sell sell. @JeffBezos needs to learn a lesson by allowing #NRABloodMoney is no good in our hands or in our lives. Not worth it. "If you want to change the world it starts with you".
2461 2018-02-27 11:44:32 This...This...is how we got from COlumbine to here.

2471 2018-02-27 11:35:53 “Bump stocks “ have nothing to do with this. They are a waste and a gimmick. PP murders over a million unborn babies each year. The blood of these millions is on their hands and yours for supporting them.
2472 2018-02-27 11:35:40 If Obama can circumvent immigration with DACA, why can't Trump just ban bump stocks. Nobody cared about constitutionality for 8 fucking years. Why start now? (BTW: I think bump stocks are sloppy and mechanically inferior, but my point is about political rhetoric.)

2475 2018-02-27 11:35:20 We also have a gun control problem. The most conservative compromise I've heard is banning bump stocks and recalling magazines. If they'd only just start somewhere.
2476 2018-02-27 11:34:48 has someone informed him it doesn't work that way? WTF? I want bump stocks banned, but the orange clown can't do it himself.
2477 2018-02-27 11:34:16 Gun stocks are also publicly traded, same question rephrased.
2478 2018-02-27 11:34:05 Anyone else laughing maniacally at the irony of Trump talking abt taking guns away w/no Due Process, banning Bump Stocks and flat out telling Govt to fight the NRA? What will his 30% make of this? 

The world has gone mad.
2479 2018-02-27 11:33:52 @realDonaldTrump By regulating the bump stocks like we do machinegun ownership. Instead of banning them you will satisfy, at least quite down both segments and not turn members of the NRA and gun owners against you if you intend to run for a second term.
2480 2018-02-27 11:33:10 Bump stocks still make it one pull of trigger one bullet. Just speeds that process up.
2481 2018-02-27 11:31:42 And I'm all for banning bump stocks.  Arent you a Canadian citizen? If so, why are you butting into an American issue?
2482 2018-02-27 11:31:41 I am considering to stop mentioning I even trade crypto to anyone but closest friends in RL. I'll just tell I trade FIAT/stocks, have a small portfolio and can't make enough to cover my rent.

2487 2018-02-27 11:28:12 Bump stocks should be regulated the same way we regulate machineguns. Your failure to do this only indicates to me that you are willing to help the demo / socialist destroy our second amendment. I couldn't afford the cost of the ammunition the thing would gobble up, others could.

2494 2018-02-27 11:25:23 Right now it's bump stocks. Next week or month it will be semi-automatics.

2501 2018-02-27 11:22:14 That's a bit disingenuous. I'm pro 2nd, but the utility of bump stocks is severely lacking & even if it's intended purpose was for disabilities, that's not who buys them primarily. Ppl buy them for fun, to shoot off automatic- like fire ( which it does mimic).

False.
1. Morally sound people don't look for credit when doing the right thing.
2. A bump stock was used in the Vegas shooting not the MSD school shooting.
 @realDonaldTrump wants to ban bump stocks to appease those who want regulation hoping it will shut them up.

2575 2018-02-27 10:40:47 @realDonaldTrump You’re not afraid of the NRA? All of a sudden the only ideas you’re backing are banning bump stocks and arming teachers because they’d be willing to die for their students. Face it, you don’t want to lose business for the NRA; 30 mil talks

2693 2018-02-27 09:00:45 NRA will gladly let bump stocks be banned because it doesn't hurt gun sales. They are making a superficial jesture to avoid talks about meaningful gun controls, or bans. This is so easy to see through. NRA is facing tremendous pressure, and even they know they must do something.

2698 2018-02-27 08:59:42 I don’t believe any rational leftist is calling for “all guns”. There might be some far left people doing it, but the mainstream of American public is seeking removal of semi-automatic rifles, HC mags and bump stocks. We don’t want your handguns, shotguns or hunting rifles.

2808 2018-02-27 07:21:04 'Assault weapons' don't exist. If you can join the military at 18 You can own a rifle. Gunshow loopholes don't exist. Bump stocks are irrelevant to argument. We still have no evidence they've been used in any mass shooting ever. No evidence Vegas shooter used.
2809 2018-02-27 07:21:04 This is a Mar '17 article. Since then Cda has bought back some of the stranded assets and will continue to do so in order to not look at economic reality while draining dry Cdn pensions in junk POS compulsory stocks. Someone tell me I'm wrong.

2813 2018-02-27 07:19:43 Trump "has no idea what"??Only Fake News CNN "has no idea what". Trump has a very clear idea "what". He wants to secure schools, arm veterans&teachers who know or learn to use guns, up the age to 21 to acquire AR15, deal effectively with mental health, ban bump stocks& much more.

2826 2018-02-27 07:08:37 Yeah he's said to bedoing this according to the agenda that fits the noise of the CNN haters. First of all, he never definitively said he was doing anything but banning bump stocks - everything else were thoughts/discussions - but leave it to CNN to twist it to fit their agenda.
2827 2018-02-27 07:08:20 Bill is spot on re this one. It’s in need of a comprehensive plan that has to start with better gun control and banning of specific weapons ie AR15 etc...and bump stocks.

2833 2018-02-27 07:05:41 What's your argument? From that I only seen You want less guns. How? What is the plan? If you say ban AR15 Why? 1-2% of all gun deaths annually.  You want to ban bump stocks? Agree. You want the age raised to 21 for rifle. Why? If you can join military you can own a rifle.

2921 2018-02-27 06:19:14 Well gov Kasich if Trump deserves credit for banning bump stocks because they make a rifle an Assault Weapon then why not go the extra step & ban assault weapons. This proposal is a no brainer. Trump & Republicans get on with this as Nov. 18 th is getting closer each day .

2923 2018-02-27 06:18:31 Bump stocks were not mentioned in our discussion. Misdirection.The current bill introduced in the house to ban Asault Weapons has a grandfather clause for all AWs already in circulation (by thier definition of AWs).And how will they enforce the bump ban?Not required to register.

2933 2018-02-27 06:13:19 PRESIDENT TRUMP: These  things  MUST BE CHANGED with NO FURTHER discussions. PLEASE DO IT NOW!  Wasting time  may  only cause another disaster... 
1)  Change the age of owning a gun to 21.
2)   BAN ASSAULT RIFLES
3)   BAN BUMP STOCKS
4)   BAN ALL DONATIONS FROM THE NRA
2934 2018-02-27 06:13:08 Well either way civil war or not, can we agree that banning bump stocks, having comprehensive background checks, and having mandatory waiting periods is the way to go. Because that takes away no guns, but does a hell of a lot to prevent mass shootings.

2940 2018-02-27 06:11:16 But btw if we are being realistic, obviously we aren’t banning guns. The real solution to all of these problems are comprehensive background checks, a ban of bump stocks, and manidtory waiting periods. All three of those things can prevent mass shootings without taking any guns.
2941 2018-02-27 06:11:00 I’m not surprised that he’s all talk no action. In his televised meeting with the Governors, he said “no more bump stocks” then he walked that back and said “Well it will be so hard to get them”. Sick to put money before children’s safety. #guncontrolnow
2942 2018-02-27 06:10:48 A 50% drop brings us back maybe 5 years in prices, it's not the end of the world. People need to know that prices fall sometimes, it's part of a healthy market. Same as tech stocks in the early 2000s: the bust washed out the speculators and created balance.
2943 2018-02-27 06:10:20 Seems like a nice process to follow from insto's. Sell the oversupply story then short lithium stocks. Buy at the bottom then rinse and repeat. The fact the oversupply story is wrong is probably known or perhaps they just don't understand the market?
2944 2018-02-27 06:10:15 A gun ban won’t pass and would be tossed out by the Supreme Court anyway.  But several moderate gun control measures could pass, like  increasing the minimum age to 21, or getting rid of bump stocks.  A few more, too.

2969 2018-02-27 05:49:29 Right, and here again I agree with you. But we can craft regulations to make inanimate objects less deadly, since we know people are going to be people. Why must we have bump stocks? Why can’t semi-auto rifles magazines be limited for civilians?

2976 2018-02-27 05:44:58 You're right Mollie, but because bump stocks were always illegal, it was only the Obama Justice Dept. that "declared" them to be legal.

2988 2018-02-27 05:35:51 He’ll deserve credit when and if he actually does something about bump stocks. Like many I think he’s saying he’ll do something for gun control and then do nothing when it is no longer the hot topic. NRA owns him.
2989 2018-02-27 05:34:35 Besides dictating public policy he's giving financial advice too ( Sell those FedEx stocks in protest). Defending the sheriff and Trump bashing. Calling for strikes, boycotts and more division and hatred.

2997 2018-02-27 05:32:13 One problem.  An executive order on banning bump stocks would result in court cases.  ATF decided it could not regulate bump stocks during the Obama administration (2010 and 2012).  A federal law is required... so good luck in court.  Ryan and McConnell don't want to pass a law.

3016 2018-02-27 05:24:05 Love to see you support the closing of the gun show loop hole, ban outright bump stocks, and the raising of the minimum age to buy ANY firearm until 21 years of age. It's a start.

3037 2018-02-27 05:17:16 No AR15’s, no bump stocks, no Gatling devices, no high volume magazines...full stop.  Mental illness is a tricky one, most aren’t playing with a full deck.  Very difficult to draw a line.  Better to improve the background check process than open the mental illness Pandora’s box

8. We need to make it easier for honest stable people to carry up to a .38 caliber gun canceled nationwide.

9. Ban bump stocks with out special permit and certification.

3059 2018-02-27 05:05:29 So on top of the Promise program making kids better,meanwhile they jacked their pensions up with stocks from guns, did they get that from the NRA
3060 2018-02-27 05:05:16 Of course, we knew this would happen. He's also backing out of bump stocks. He only said those things to not look like such an ass in the wake of Parkland. He had no intention to follow thru. Press should see thru his chicanery by now, it's naive not to.
3061 2018-02-27 05:04:17 I’m an NRA member and I’m all for banning bump stocks but raising the age to purchase to 21 will not solve anything it’s unnecessary
3062 2018-02-27 05:04:17 Trump said he'd unilaterally ban bump stocks BECAUSE he has no constitutional authority to do so. He thinks that makes him look good.
3063 2018-02-27 05:04:14 He is talking bump stocks trying to deflect. He is going to write it out himself. What does that mean....
3064 2018-02-27 05:03:35 Chicks really be selling themselves to these men for surgery and some clothes are you kidding me?!?!

3070 2018-02-27 04:59:24 Yes, GDP growth was sub 3% during Obama’s eight years. Corporations have been piling up cash boards and bought stocks back, which has inflated stock prices.
3071 2018-02-27 04:56:50 so do you feel bump stocks is enough?
3072 2018-02-27 04:56:17 Don’t give teachers guns. Stop deflecting the issue. Ban bump stocks. No gun show loophole. Treat mental health victims. Do something. Stop talking about it. Are 18 shootings in 2 months not enough of a red flag? There is a problem. Fix it.

3082 2018-02-27 04:54:46 Why do cons want to treat schools like their for profit prision failed idea? Teachers teach,they didnt get in the bus of armed guards. 

Treat a gun like a car, u need a license, insurance and register it w the fbi. Limit mags 2,10 shots and bump stocks are illegal for starters
3083 2018-02-27 04:54:28 What the actual hell does he mean by that?  If he is talking about some kind of executive order banning bump stocks, he is going to both fail and send the gun nuts into a frenzy.  But hell, that could be really interesting.  Go ahead @POTUS make it so.
3084 2018-02-27 04:54:21 Giving up bump stocks would be an inch in my opinion which Trump and the NRA both have suggested
3085 2018-02-27 04:53:48 I'll look into it. Love BCM products. Looks like they are 3 ozs lighter than the Magpul CTR stocks I've been using.
3086 2018-02-27 04:53:44 1.  I am not a member of the NRA.  2. I have experience with weapons.  3.  I never pulled the "they are coming for your guns" (that is your statement not mine).  and 4. I agree with you re bump stocks (they mechanically alter the weapon in a way that emulates automatic fire).
3087 2018-02-27 04:53:20 If somebody really want to be a hero there would not be any hesitations in gun control. Such as: 1. Banning bump stocks 2. Changing background checks making them very strict. No one with any signs of mental illness. 3. Changing the age to purchasing gun/rifles to 21 years of age.
3088 2018-02-27 04:53:20 There are about 2,800 stocks listed on the New York Stock exchange and another 3,100 stocks listed on the NASDAQ but only 1,500 #cryptocurrencies on the World Wide Open Markets
3089 2018-02-27 04:52:42 Add to that...a better background check system and moving the age of weapons purchases to 21 and banning bump stocks would help too. The facts are that cities with the strictest gun laws have the highest homicide rates. Has the murder rates dropped in these cities? No!

3091 2018-02-27 04:50:49 Always the NRA talking points, "they're coming for your guns, scary!"  No, we just need to ban military-type murder machines from availability, bump stocks that effectively create a machine gun, increase age of ownership,   limit size of stockpiles, etc. You can keep your musket.

3097 2018-02-27 04:49:56 In some conversations I’ve seen, the level of specificity and parsing of details around gun functioning is impressive & instructive (bump stocks, auto v. semi-auto, etc.). My wish is that conservatives could bring this level of nuance to other issues occasionally.
3098 2018-02-27 04:48:23 Need to them we care about FedEx and purchase some stocks.  Stocks are currently 254.51 a share. We get enough ppl to buy maybe we can split the shares and make money at the same time.
3099 2018-02-27 04:47:39 Never ban things that go bump in the night except for bump stocks on those semi-automatic assault rifles which essentially turn the weapon into an automatic rifle. If anyone is allowed to use a bump stock it should be the US Military or Military veterans protecting US schools.

3101 2018-02-27 04:46:36 I would not be in favor of banning semi automatic rifles. I would consider limits to magazine clips. I am also in favor of banning bump stocks. I oppose arming teachers as better options available
3102 2018-02-27 04:45:58 Trump ripped into Obama’s use of executive orders.  But he claims that he can use them to stop bump stocks. Wrong. Only Congress can do this.  He must force GOP to defy  NRA. Otherwise it’s all talk no action
3103 2018-02-27 04:45:55 Ban on bump stocks, and no individual ownership of assault-grade firepower, including AR15s. If people want to shoot AR15s, then keep them under lock and key at gun ranges that meet strict ownership standards. They don’t belong in public. #gunreform
3104 2018-02-27 04:45:52 Please. No. Media dont even pretend you are giving Trump credit for "fighting" the NRA. Bump stocks are gimmicks, and most 18 yr olds cant afford a gun. The NRA gave 31 mil. Old pals laughing at you. #msnbc #cnn #neveragain
3105 2018-02-27 04:45:48 I read it. I have several AR platform firearms. I have bumpfire stocks. They specify bayonet lugs, barrel shrouds, vertical foregrips, folding stock etc. All aesthetics. It’ll NEVER pass. It’s funny how ignorant and arrogant the liberals are when it comes to firearms.

3107 2018-02-27 04:45:29 I figured he would’ve come out with an alternative statement on bump stocks by now.

3127 2018-02-27 04:38:31 I'm familiar with the Trump Bump. Did you look at my graph? It shows the exact opposite of the Trump Bump, but for the value of the dollar. Your stock are up, but you can buy less with your dollars. If you have no stocks, it's even worse.
3128 2018-02-27 04:38:09 Traders buy the rumor sell the news...way the markets work whether its stocks or crypto...but the stronger hands hold and or buy during the dip. Which is a good thing long term.

3130 2018-02-27 04:36:58 Does this mean Abbot plans on returning his NRA money and that Texas will be banning bump stocks and AR-15s because I am sick to death of mass shootings.

3134 2018-02-27 04:36:01 Bump stocks are what I was referring to specifically which are perfectly legal. As for illegal modifications, the fact that the rifle is so easily modifed is the problem. As long as you have the rifle and the knowledge, you can modify it, which is why it should be much harder-
3135 2018-02-27 04:35:36 Kid, he's a billionaire and that money has nothing to do with the NRA. He really doesn't give a shit if they donate him a few thousand more or not. He's calling for a ban on bump stocks (which Obama unbanned), increases in background checks, and more age restrictions

But confiscating guns is a bad idea and un-American. People have a right to self defense and we need it as a backup to the Army.
3139 2018-02-27 04:32:49 Bump stocks don’t classify the semi-auto rifles under a fully automatic weapon class determined by ATF. I’m talking about fully auto weapons built after 1986, and even buying one built before 1986 requires special licensing to legally own.

BAN THE manufacturing, sale and possession illegal. Otherwise assault weapons sales will soar during legislation.
3142 2018-02-27 04:31:57 Bump stocks are a novelty item that serve no practical purpose. The only problem I have with background checks is it puts a burden on low income buyers. FFL’s pass that cost to the consumers.

3145 2018-02-27 04:30:57 @realDonaldTrump You recently said people are afraid of the NRA. No, we're not afraid of them, but YOU are. You're so afraid you are no longer pursuing raising the age to buy semi-automatic guns & you are no longer advocating banning the sales of bump stocks.  YOU ARE A COWARD!
3146 2018-02-27 04:30:28 @CNBCFastMoney @HalftimeReport did my homework and here's my two stocks for unusual activity @petenajarian (STX) and (PEP)  or  ?
3147 2018-02-27 04:30:25 Those who think banning bump stocks will actually do anything are hilarious to me. 

Such people ignore the fact that the stocks came into existence in response to the full auto ban as a way of getting around it. 

A ban on them will just produce the same result via other means.
3148 2018-02-27 04:29:40 It wasn’t confidence. When liars are caught out a dead giveaway is their facial ticks which cause raised eyebrows & hints of a smile. Whilst Labor’s stocks are up Shorten’s rating aren’t & the vipers are waiting to strike
3149 2018-02-27 04:29:31 Focus on the background checks and the mentally ill. Blame agencies and 12 certain states for not submitting crimes/arrests to the federal government so they go directly to the FBI. Donald will ban the stocks 4 Dems but banning guns will just lead to new methods. Soz
3150 2018-02-27 04:29:30 I’m sorry... Anyone who isn’t working to keep assault weapons out of the hands of average Americans - just isn’t working hard enough.  Ban all assault weapons and bump stocks. Your political seat will be given to the person who WILL take a stand against guns in America.
3151 2018-02-27 04:29:25 Smart high income earners invest their money where it does *them* the most good. US stocks are not where that happens. "Invisible hand" is a fallacy. Kind of like "trickle down".
3152 2018-02-27 04:29:22 Roger, & that ought to be the line in the sand.
At the end of the day an AR is just a rifle.
The left's goal is disarmament.
You want to ban bump stocks? Maybe we can talk.
But banning ARs. Nope. That's a bridge too far.
21 to buy an AR? Then 21 to vote, buy beer & cigarettes etc
3153 2018-02-27 04:29:00 Hello David, when you took the CFA, did they teach you Elliott Wave theory in the curriculum? Do you believe it is valid? Some of the Elliott wave guys are scaring me out of gold stocks, but I  still have a big physical stack at home.
3154 2018-02-27 04:28:37 Even if bump stocks are banned (they won't be) it wouldn't actually change anything. A couple pieces of food and some pegs to hold up the gun can be a functioning bump stock. There's video. You gonna ban wood? People find a way. You can't ban items. It NEVER works.
3155 2018-02-27 04:28:06 my thoughts exactly, personally i view "bumps" (stocks, lanyards, bungee cords etc) as gimmicks. but i have been amazed at how effectively, and without question, this whole narrative has been swallowed both by the chattering classes and many who should know better
3156 2018-02-27 04:27:33 And MS crushed Lithium stocks today with a report that some consider in the league of Mckinsey's on Mobile Phones back in the late 80's. ie they could be wrong by multiples!
3157 2018-02-27 04:26:56 Bump stocks are a circumvention of existing regulations on fully automatic weapons. No ban is needed but a tax stamp should be.

3160 2018-02-27 04:25:45 LOL! I see your point @mumofromumo , @CNBC has a "tiny" mistake lol, indeed equities = stocks! so, yeah... It should read "Stocks will outperform bonds in the long run"... someone was asleep at @CNBC
3161 2018-02-27 04:25:29 Yes hard to know their motives but the article has certainly had an affect. I won't be buying any Li stocks yet I reckon this has a few more weeks to play out here imo.
3162 2018-02-27 04:25:25 He just wants to give the NRA/Gun manufacturers taxpayers dollars to buy 700,000 guns for 20% of our teachers. This is all a con for  big money. No doubt all the GOP are buying up gun stocks to enrich themselves on our children’s lives.
3163 2018-02-27 04:24:43 I am the mother of a veteran, the daughter of a veteran, and the life partner of a Marine brat; my children’s father was a veteran. I support sensible gun reform. There is no reason for civilians to have AS-15s or humongous magazines or bump stocks. #VetsForGunReform

3165 2018-02-27 04:22:32 BUMP stocks were made legal by Obama. Why? To create an issue for today?
3166 2018-02-27 04:22:13 A secret is revealing of successful trading put an order at the price you were before putting stop-loss. I don't know how accurate is this but works for me very efficiently #trading #stocks #tradingsignals #tradingpsychology #tradingstratgies #intraday #stoploss
3167 2018-02-27 04:21:47 You make s**t up.Mis-interpret the 2nd Amendment. If you want a god**** handgun good for you. Liberal Democrats want laws to match getting a license to drive a car, stronger background checks & removal of bump stocks, Assault rifles and AR-whatever. You only care about NRA $$$$
3168 2018-02-27 04:21:43 Yeah & soon enough he'll walk back his support to ban bump stocks & strengthening background checks. And all will be well at NRA-land. 
The ppl in his "listening session" will never get that 1 hr & 15 mins back. It's a shame the NRA's bitch had no intention of listening to you.
3169 2018-02-27 04:21:14 @myfinology hi I am interested in buying mrf stocks but I feel that it’s over valued at this this time 
What would you recommend?
At what price should I buy this stock
3170 2018-02-27 04:21:12 @realDonaldTrump Bump Stocks banned? How does that stop Fla, San Bernardino, Orlando, Boston Marathon, Ft. Hood, et al killings? One 18 year old shoots up a place and now NO 18 year old can own a rifle? Even pistols, decrease gang killing? Decrease Chicago deaths by pistol?
3171 2018-02-27 04:20:45 @cnnbrk @CBSNews @NBCNews @SNLUpdateIf @realDonaldTrump Bump Stocks & fully auto-weapons should be banned.  I believe in the right to own guns, but military style guns should be handled by the military.  When will the federal government ban them.   #BadPresident #sad
3172 2018-02-27 04:18:28 @realDonaldTrump I am highly disappointed in your decision to ban Bump fire stocks! This is NOT what I voted for! This one move will greatly hurt you in 2020! I hope you reconsider this ban. #2A #NoGunBans
#NoGunControl #NRA #MAGA #NoGunBans
3173 2018-02-27 04:18:19 It seems clear the common ground is that everyone thinks military hardware like AR-15 assault rifles, extended ammo clips, and bump stocks should be outlawed. Everyone except politicians paid by the NRA. So, we're fixing that.
3174 2018-02-27 04:17:42 Pure disastrous. And IBM stocks are skyhigh.

3176 2018-02-27 04:16:55 though two of the weapons shown in the room did indeed have bump stocks installed, but given the near total blackout due to the "ongoing investigation", has there ever been a official confirmation that these were indeed the weapons used?
illegal auto sears still seem more likely
3177 2018-02-27 04:16:38 BAN BUMP STOCKS! BAN AR-15s and AK-47s and any other automatic assault rifle! Time is now. #BanBumpStocks #BanAssaultWeapons
3178 2018-02-27 04:16:21 Trump and the @GOP MIGHT ban bump stocks.
The GOP at the state level MIGHT raise the age to buy an assault weapon from 18 to 21.
3179 2018-02-27 04:15:40 I know them all too well:p
3180 2018-02-27 04:15:29 @foxnewsnight The Prez has betrayed the NRA & is strong arming their leadership to accept his challenging the 2nd amendment. Banning bump stocks doesn't solve the national problem of gun violence but makes Prez look & feel good. He joins corporations like Delta censoring thought
3181 2018-02-27 04:14:51 Condi is right.
The AR15 should be banned & those already owned bought back.
Much too dangerous, even law enforcement cannot defend against it.  No Bump Stocks, No High Capacity Magazines. 
Same requirements for driving/owning a car should apply to guns.
3182 2018-02-27 04:14:04 This time gun sales and stocks didn't go up.
America is waking up to the fact that guns kill innocents
America wants #GunControl

3183 2018-02-27 04:14:03 He DID talk about bump stocks & directed them to change it but they never did it! We have laws already about the mentally ill but laws have to be enforced! Dems want solutions but NOT if DT is the one making them because this is their new talking point! Same with DACA!Hypocrites
3184 2018-02-27 04:14:01 Random thoughts. 
Trump getting rid of bump stocks...
Maybe raising the age to buy ARs to 21
In exchange for national reciprocity. 
@realDonaldTrump
3185 2018-02-27 04:13:57 We’ll see how really brave he is when it comes time to back up his break with the NRA regarding raising the age to 21 to buy AR 15’s and make bump stocks illegal for civilians. We all heard it!

3188 2018-02-27 04:13:30 No that the @NRA has explained to trump that no gun law reform of any kind will be acceptable to the he will drop his call for banning bump stocks as well.
3189 2018-02-27 04:13:28 They should check which unions' pension plans have these companies' stocks in them, and either divest of them from the plan, or let the activists cash out. Works for 401Ks too.
3190 2018-02-27 04:13:28 1. I don't want bump stocks banned.
2. Bump stocks are nothing more than a novelty. They are impractical in every situation save for the lone exception of the Vegas shooting, firing upon many targets from an elevated position. Even still semi auto is likely more effective.
3191 2018-02-27 04:13:15 .@BillHaslam from TN has said that’s what he wants. No bump stocks, 21 yrs old to buy those guns

3193 2018-02-27 04:12:49 Sitting watching the News & listening to @realDonaldTrump proud of his banning bump stocks but not the weapons they affix to. He still wants to arm teachers & talking about volume of guns making the difference. Sounds like an @NRA ad to me. #BanAssaultWeapons #ProtectOurChildren

3195 2018-02-27 04:12:22 Bump stocks alter the rate of fire to an AR 15 when attached to the rifle.
3196 2018-02-27 04:12:11 People don't realize stocks represent a liability to a corporation which issues stock as a means to raise money.I liken stocks to individual micro loan ponzi schemes w/worst scheme of all is the 401k that was created to buttress the distressed market shortly aft Vietnam war ended

3201 2018-02-27 04:11:21 Wrong, He did during the governors meeting,  much more stringent background checks, keeping weapons out of mentally ill people's hands, executive order to ban bump stocks, fighting the NRA if it gets in the way  @realDonaldTrump
3202 2018-02-27 04:11:06 Luckily have lots of stocks to winter them on.
3203 2018-02-27 04:10:19 #poopcubes haha
3204 2018-02-27 04:10:18 But you can ban bump stocks so the number of people killed and wounded is less until the shooter is stopped.
3205 2018-02-27 04:10:17 “The first thing Hitler did was outlaw bump stocks.”
3206 2018-02-27 04:10:03 By supporting the NRA, they support assault rifles and bump stocks. Their statement means nothing
3207 2018-02-27 04:10:02 Whatever we plead it will fall on deaf ears. The politicians and bureaucrats are thick skinned and don't understand the travails of an honest taxpayer. They pay tax, deposit their savings in stocks or banks, only to see that some crook has looted & scooted with active connivance
3208 2018-02-27 04:08:51 That's why I said "that semi-auto".  Bump stocks are stupid.
3209 2018-02-27 04:08:10 Guns owners don't give a shit about bump stocks, there a waste of ammo. Oh yea you can't ban accessories and you can't ban belt loops.. oops!

3214 2018-02-27 04:03:27 Well when he stood firm against the @NRA for stricter background checks and raising the age limit, and banning slid fire (bump stocks) he has not backed down. More than any other politician. Also he said he wants the bump stocks added into the fully auto classification.

3216 2018-02-27 04:02:16 @realDonaldTrump How DARE you seek to trample on a constitutionally guaranteed right in unilaterally deciding to act in "Bump Stocks", which have been used in a crime exactly ONE time. Not even Obama was that stupid You promised to support 2A; your words say differently.
3217 2018-02-27 04:01:50 I wonder if it’s just wired into conservative thinking to be hypocritical about virtually -everything-. For example:

Obama after Sandy Hook: we need gun control 
Republicans: OMG THIS N(word)’s NERVE
Trump after Parkland: ban bump stocks
Republicans: maybe we’ll consider

3229 2018-02-27 03:53:59 @POTUS @VP @KellyannePolls @PressSec Not clear why there is a desire to bend to pressure from left regarding "gun control". Myself and millions of law abiding gun owners are not the problem.
Bump stocks are not a problem.
Not doing background cks is an FBI issue. Just follow laws
3230 2018-02-27 03:53:54 Oh? What military grade weapons are doing all the killing on the streets. Please enlighten me because assault rifles are illegal, bump stocks will soon be illegal, and the majority of US gun deaths are by handguns.
3231 2018-02-27 03:53:52 Still many Mi users are watching the markets/stocks very closely. The whole idea is to stay detached to the daily noise and the micro movements and analysis of stocks. Over time each stock trade should be just any other trade just like another flip of coin.  

#Detachment
3232 2018-02-27 03:52:48 Interesting that Trump did not say a word about bump stocks after Las Vegas when that proposal would have been relevant.  Trump is just repeating NRA talking points as the tape has demonstrated.  No the left wants gun control reform, something that has not happened in 8 + years.
3233 2018-02-27 03:52:44 NRA  owns CONGRESS, they can stop Bump stocks, not Trump!

3240 2018-02-27 03:50:09 That was in response to banning the bump stocks. A stance that I am anti-NRA on. I believe that the age increase will pass but we will see. I know the difference between the two but thanks

3253 2018-02-27 03:45:38 No bump stocks and teachers with guns.  That’s what he is selling. It is valid to criticize him.
3254 2018-02-27 03:45:36 A drop in the Bucket banning bump stocks should be banning Assault Rifles at the same time The Majority of American citizens are for banning All Assault Rifles & bump stocks
3255 2018-02-27 03:45:35 No AR-15s. No high capacity magazines. No suppressors. No bump stocks. No cross state cc.
3256 2018-02-27 03:45:08 If he isn't careful this could turn into a "I abandoned free market principles to save the free market" moment. No one who didn't have one heard of bump stocks until Vegas, and they didn't play a role in either Sutherland Springs or Parkland. So he better tread lightly.
3257 2018-02-27 03:45:03 I think bump stocks are just a gimmick. I know the call is for "not an inch". But I just don't care about a fad. Most ordinary people could not afford to feed a real automatic. Not for long. I prefer one at a time shooting.
3258 2018-02-27 03:44:16 Essentially, you are saying only own blue chip stocks and gold bullion??

3264 2018-02-27 03:41:50 Ok.Check for stockshares in any gun manufacturer.And yes, stockshares is the correct term.Stock is slang for stockshares.

3270 2018-02-27 03:40:00 The problem is that it is hard to give credit for throwing crumbs. Last year people demanded that bump stocks be illegal and they would do nothing. No people demand more aggressive action and they offer a placating gesture so they can avoid more

3279 2018-02-27 03:36:48 We’re not going to ban the AR-15. But we can ban bump stocks. I don’t know about the age change,” said Sen. Lindsey
3280 2018-02-27 03:36:48 Trump claims he is "writing bump stocks out himself." Why didn't he do it already after Vegas? NRA.

3284 2018-02-27 03:35:20 There you go making assumptions again. Where did I say I was opposed to regulation of machine guns or bump stocks? Your assumptions about the NRA are just as flawed. Ask more questions and make fewer assumptions, it would help you communicate better.
3285 2018-02-27 03:35:09 Class B can vote but they don’t have the same weight. You’d know that if you had read the investopedia link I tweeted earlier. You do realize stocks represent debt on the books for corporations, right?
3286 2018-02-27 03:34:52 Trump and his pathetic "I don't know what I'm saying but it makes sense to me"the continuous unhinged stories of what he's going to make happen about background checks bump stocks etc that's today to that group and tomorrow to NRA leaders they will forget about it let's do lunch.
3287 2018-02-27 03:34:46 It is NOT the right of American Citizens to kill other people. The 2nd amendment doesn't guarantee citizens the right to own military grade weapons and bump stocks whose purpose is to inflict as much damage on PEOPLE as possible.
3288 2018-02-27 03:34:46 M16 haven’t had full auto in 30 years now they have a 3 round burst!  Full auto is a waste of ammo and only good for suppressive fire.  And bump stocks are only a novelty item impossible to hit anything you’re aiming at totally Worthless!

3302 2018-02-27 03:29:29 (1) Obama did not endorse or approve bump stocks - there was no legislation or executive order. Trump did not repeal bump stocks via legislation or executive order - he made a statement. There's a bill before congress now about bump stocks but they refuse to vote on it.
3303 2018-02-27 03:29:20 He's not getting anything from bump stocks. Why should he care. He's getting a portion of every gun sold. It really is all about the money. Children die and Trump can only talk about himself.
3304 2018-02-27 03:29:19 Silly kid, stocks are for people w/ jobs. You know, the responsible adults, which are typically Conservative. Liberals don't invest in the stock market because that'd make them pro-Capitalism. SJWs like yourself rely on income from CNN, Soros, DNC...

Why is this so hard? Not trying to take away #2.Just being smart.  Unlike #NRA.@NRA
3309 2018-02-27 03:27:22 Trump is such an ignorant ass. He has no authority to ban bump stocks. Caught in his own delusions thinking he's a dictator.
3310 2018-02-27 03:26:40 Very true on funding of mental health programs. And I realize there are some things, as a gun owner and #2A proponent, that we can concede to in regulations, bump stocks for example, but the banning of firearm sales altogether is not the solution in my book. Take care!
3311 2018-02-27 03:26:28 You own stocks?  I highly doubt it. So, the stock market isn’t helping you. You do realize that the stock market is not the economy, right?
3312 2018-02-27 03:26:11 Let me help you with some ideas.  Ban assault rifles and bump stocks.  Raise the age limit to purchase, close the loops holes for gun shows, background checks and cooling off periods.  These are all a good place to start b/c arming teachers and more locks on doors won't do it.
3313 2018-02-27 03:25:39 @JohnKasich Banning Bump Stocks will take years to get through the courts.  BAN THE WEAPON, all 2000 styles.
3314 2018-02-27 03:25:17 Ehh, all my friends who know more about guns than I do oppose banning bump stocks, as did the ATF under Obama. So I defer to them and oppose it as well.
3315 2018-02-27 03:24:51 The NRA told Trump he could ban the bump fire stocks.

3318 2018-02-27 03:23:23 This is actually hilarious. Set political ideology aside for bit. What investor would suggest this? Virtually all competition jumps ship to essentially abandon a large swath of the market, whoever sticks around is going to have a lot of incoming business. So, stocks rise.

3321 2018-02-27 03:23:00 It depends on what you're trading. XSO measures companies in the bottom 200 of the ASX 300. XEC measures companies too small to be included in the All Ords (the top 500) - speccies/penny stocks in other words, which I see a _lot_ of people on twitter talking about.

3326 2018-02-27 03:21:41 How about banning or restricting assault rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, research on gun violence, increased mental health restrictions, etc etc? They’re against all of those options.

3329 2018-02-27 03:21:21 Make it illegal to own or rent bump stocks or automatic weapons.  To rent the ARw-15 you only need i.d. you don't need electronic check.  Change the laws, get rid of the  automatic weapons and bump stocks.
3330 2018-02-27 03:21:03 I defend the 2A and know that it doesn’t protect all weapons. Bump stocks and gat cranks should be illegal.  Large round clips should be limited.  Now your rights before you lose them fighting for something that is not your right.  #CommonSenseGunLaws
3331 2018-02-27 03:20:57 I like 2A but bump stocks are a bit much and 21 across the board except shotguns and bolt action rifles.
3332 2018-02-27 03:20:16 Mike can you please acknowledge that trump is wrong. No president should rule with a Pen & Phone

President Donald Trump insists he will unilaterally ban “bump stocks,” the gun accessory used to simulate automatic fire, even if lawmakers decline to take up the issue.
3333 2018-02-27 03:20:02 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
3334 2018-02-27 03:19:30 So you think the NRA wants bump stocks banned, but for some odd reason it isn't happening? You really believe that? After they stopped the bill to do it? I have some land to sell you.

3338 2018-02-27 03:17:54 I googled “NRA position bump stocks”. I posted what I could find published by the NRA. Seems pretty clear.
3339 2018-02-27 03:17:47 @Emma4Change Trump already backing off initial black & white promises to raise age to 21 and to ban bump stocks. He needs to know you teens, parents & educators are serious. He's hoping when you are back in school, you all will back off. Don't go back, just protest outside.
3340 2018-02-27 03:16:23 A valid argument can be made that bump-stocks essentially convert semi-auto rifles into full. Instead of modifying the seat bump-stocks modify the operation of the trigger. ATF can ban such conversions, then the courts could rule on the taking, due process, other const. issues

3342 2018-02-27 03:16:11 Now Trump is backing away from  saying people over 21 can purchase a gun.  This is the same guy that said who is afraid of the NRA, he is.  Age does not matter Mr. Trump bump stocks and semi automatic weapons should not be available to the public.

3351 2018-02-27 03:11:09 Of course FedEx is standing with the NRA. Shipping bump stocks is a lucrative business.
3352 2018-02-27 03:11:03 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President issue isn't age,isn't the gun,isn't even bump stocks nor mental illness, issue is our fallen culture. How will age limits help? The guns haven't changed over the years so what has changed? Our culture has changed families ripped apart,it's the left!

3372 2018-02-27 03:05:39 by the way, I'm as much of a fan of Cold War Chic as the next girl, but wood stocks are pretty meh
3373 2018-02-27 03:04:44 I can fully support a comprehensive background check but cannot support raising the age to buy guns to 21. I will not ask our young people to fight our wars then come home and disarm them! As for bump stocks, it’s a distraction, a piece of furniture...can’t support it!
3374 2018-02-27 03:04:43 I 100% support bump stocks
3375 2018-02-27 03:04:33 Arming teachers is crazy. Bump stocks being legal is crazy. Buying an AR-15 without a background check is crazy. Allowing people with mental illnesses to buy guns is crazy. high-capacity magazines are crazy. This entire gun control system is fucking batshit crazy.
3376 2018-02-27 03:04:24 We're not going to see much change,maybe bump stocks and some small change on background checks .

3378 2018-02-27 03:03:48 You know damn well that if the NRA wanted bump stocks gone they would be gone tomorrow. There is absolutely no reasonable use for them. They make a semi into a less controlled and accurate weapon than a fully auto.

3403 2018-02-27 02:56:57 They basically wanna ban anything scary looking. There are hunting rifles that are more powerful and more accurate than the ar15, but because they have wood stocks it's somehow safer. What we really need are much more thorough mental and background checks.

I need you stop wearing bow ties to places that isn't bow tie approved. Like teaching about stocks and bonds.. take that bow tie off.
3405 2018-02-27 02:56:48 IMHO Bump Stocks Are BS

Just somebody trying to convince a Buyer That It Will Give Them A Almost Automatic!

3407 2018-02-27 02:55:50 There's nothing wrong with bump stocks. Please don't take anything away just take more preventable measures in mental health.

Some .. teen victims of a mass shooting have capitalized off of .. tragedy and are now experts in renewable energy, race relations, stocks & constitution. They get to go on all the shows.
Some.. are ignored because they wont selling out
3410 2018-02-27 02:55:11 Ion know about you but i spent my entire day today organizing my finances, doing taxes, and adjusting things within my stocks like i feel like I’m 40 and got a mortgage to pay or something
3411 2018-02-27 02:55:09 As long as he does things that I/we/most Republicans support, that’s irrelevant WHAT he was or even is. #Gorsuch #TaxReform #Judges #Jobs #Stocks #ACA penalty gone. #IllegalImmigration down. And more.
3412 2018-02-27 02:55:06 Where are the voices shouting that all lives matter.  They. All. Matter. This is about saving lives. Ban assault rifels & Bump stocks. Enact sensible laws  designed to curtail the lethal use of force by police. The UK isn't using the police to kill its minority population.
3413 2018-02-27 02:55:04 Amen, but bump stocks threatened the uneasy constitutional truce occupied by the unavailability of full auto.
3414 2018-02-27 02:55:00 come on loud mouth tell me 3 nra memebers that killed kids in the past 20 year ,, sell all stocks to fedex and #boycott anyone that is aganst nra,, kids you aint old  enough to know what right are wrong your still green behind the ears...
3415 2018-02-27 02:54:45 'Gun confiscation'? Nope. Democrats LOVE guns, we don't like military grade assault rifles w/ bump stocks. Hate the gun show loophole. No guns 4 domestic abusers. THAT is what's being discussed. Majority of USA agrees, including LOTS of gun owners. Stop lying & using fear tactics

3417 2018-02-27 02:53:25 Rifles and bump stocks have to be secure in brown paper wrapping.
3418 2018-02-27 02:53:20 I'm actually surprised how eager you are to broadcast your ignorance. R's tried to ban bump stocks but D's killed the bill by adding unconstitutional items. Shocker. Dems are now trying to ban all semi-autos...so basically all guns. Does being wrong about everything get tiring?
3419 2018-02-27 02:53:03 @GreggHarper @SenThadCochran @SenatorWicker please raise the age limit on buying guns, tighten school security, enforce stronger background screenings for all, and ban bump stocks and assault rifles for general public. #EnoughIsEnough #guncontrolnow #Parkland #MarchForOurLives
3420 2018-02-27 02:52:58 If killing kids to take away guns is such a good plan, when will it work? Maybe eliminating bump stocks and maybe raising the age to buy an AR-15 to 21 and maybe improving mental health services - those aren’t trade offs anyone would suggest is in play other than an ideologue.
3421 2018-02-27 02:52:42 High income earners put their money in stocks benefiting 2/3 of working Americans. It's the law of the invisible hand.
3422 2018-02-27 02:52:13 You may be frustrated not millions of Indians...Only people worried are who were doing tax evasion,havala, foreign accounts,fake loans,frauds .....
3423 2018-02-27 02:52:04 Women are always long term investors. They will sell only when their kids go for higher studies or medical emergency of any family members. We may have to provide only one suggestion:

3425 2018-02-27 02:50:59 We can not solve all the gun problems in one shot. But we must start somewhere. I believe background check, bump stocks, assault rifles fan is a great start. From there, we will work on mental illness and more.
3426 2018-02-27 02:50:53 Bump stocks are illegal in Massachusetts. @MassGovernor   Let’s ban assault weapons here now!

3431 2018-02-27 02:49:27 Is there a risk this stock would get delisted since it’s against US fed laws?

Confused...thought that’s why they (and all the other Canadian producers) have a tracking stocks to TSX?
3432 2018-02-27 02:49:22 He is not going anywhere for at least and maybe 7 more years.  Are the Dems just going to continue to #Resist for the entire time.  Surely, you support some of his gun control proposals, e.g. expanded background checks, ban of bump stocks and raise age limits for rifles to 21.
3433 2018-02-27 02:49:15 @Acosta is backing down from the bump stocks too? He's going to have to write it back in cause he already wrote it out. Jeez, I am so confused.
3434 2018-02-27 02:49:07 Bullshit. I'll even stick to the issue. Bump stocks are but ONE mechanism enabling rapid fire. The NRA undoubtedly decided it was better to allow (yes, allow) 45 to throw this bone now and take credit for 'reform' than to wait for Dems to ban all such mechanisms after Nov elex.
3435 2018-02-27 02:48:26 @realDonaldTrump

Hey, boss? Kudos to you. Deciding to ban bump stocks despite Congress's inaction is a fantastic plan. Make sure you have a genuine legal rationale and you can *really* solve a big problem here!
3436 2018-02-27 02:48:18 Just a reminder: the #NRA spent $30M to assist #Trump 2016 election. And after #ParklandShooting, has stated there should be no new legislation banning guns, including ARs or bump stocks. 

With less than 5% of world’s population, the #USA owns  roughly 50% of the world’s guns.

3439 2018-02-27 02:47:20 My point being nothing he does is in any way rooted in principle. His people said age and bump stocks may be movers, so he hit those points. Pretty soon, conservatives are wondering aloud how liberals will feel; as if its a principled policy instead of a game

3442 2018-02-27 02:46:50 To be fair, the GOP has not repealed Obamacare, are increasing the deficit with their massive spending plan, Trump is going full Obama and is going to sign an executive order overturning bump stocks, and several Republicans are all in on gun bans. Yeah, I trust the GOP...not.
3443 2018-02-27 02:46:13 Seriously? Stocks vs Equities?
3444 2018-02-27 02:46:03 Bump stocks is a token gesture. Nevertheless he will get it done and then rave about how he has done more for gun guntrol than any president in history. #TrumpLies #SpinelessPresident
3445 2018-02-27 02:45:51 Wrong again. You really need to understand what you are talking about. Bump stocks, which is what you are talking about. They DO NOT make a gun automatic. They simulate a rapid fire, but far from automatic!
3446 2018-02-27 02:44:20 Credit? Bump stocks haven’t actually been outlawed yet and ATF/DOJ has said it requires an act of Congress anyway.
3447 2018-02-27 02:43:46 I think they could word it to eliminate bump stocks without such a broad stroke.
3448 2018-02-27 02:43:24 Before they're  Completely banned, i just picked up 3 bump stocks for my nerf guns.
3449 2018-02-27 02:43:17 obama passed bump stocks. trump will ban them

3467 2018-02-27 02:38:31 Ban on bump stocks, better background checks and up the age to 21, if you can get 2 out of 3 and put metal detectors and armed police or school staff the problem will disappear.

3474 2018-02-27 02:36:23 Once again, case in point. Ban bump stocks, fine, but ban ANY modification that might make the gun fire faster? That's a broad definition that is ripe for abuse.

3479 2018-02-27 02:33:24 Of course.  The only step @realDonaldTrump will take is banning bump stocks, because his @NRA masters support that.
3480 2018-02-27 02:33:22 Are u in Favor of baning Assault Weapons & Assault Rifles. Ban Bump Stocks & all accessories like them? We need these weapons banned. They have no business being sold 2 the American Public. These are weapons of war. Not defense weapons. I believe in 2nd Amendment. Not War Weapons
3481 2018-02-27 02:33:07 Also, get your base familiar with some of the basic techniques and terminology of firearms. This is important for a variety of reasons. For instance, why is a pistol grip important to a mass shooting? Why are bump stocks a red herring in gun control?

3484 2018-02-27 02:32:11 Come on that’s not an accurate statement of the current conditions of the US economy. Wages are rising ,unemployment is falling and yes stocks are rising.

3485 2018-02-27 02:30:59 ATF can ban bump stocks by rule with existing law
3486 2018-02-27 02:30:58 Don't forget that Columbine happened in 1999 and the democrats had control of the house, Senate and Whitehouse for 2 years when Obama was elected in 2008. Why wasn't anything done then? Why did Obama approve bump stocks? #2020
3487 2018-02-27 02:30:51 21 age limit for an assault rifle and banning bump stocks is a no brainer. I’m a gun owner and an NRA member. This is common sense and if at the very least this can’t be accomplished, I will let my NRA memebership expire.
3488 2018-02-27 02:30:47 Let’s be clear: You are defending one’s rights to bear arms as being one and the same as defending one’s rights to bump stocks, assault rifles, high capacity magazines and side-stepping background checks. NOT in the Constitution, @tedcruz.

3497 2018-02-27 02:27:45 We all know R's will not vote for anything the NRA opposes.. Period.  We played this after sandy hook and again with bump stocks after Vegas. I don't think R's are murderers or anything like that.. Trump will walk everything back as will Rubio
3498 2018-02-27 02:27:29 No Wayyy..... Next you'll tell me he's backing away from making bump stocks illegal.

Replace all these enabling mofo's come November and neuter this orange clown.
3499 2018-02-27 02:27:27 He knows it makes no difference to NRA members if bump stocks are banned. He's throwing the tards a bone.
3500 2018-02-27 02:27:01 Trump can’t ban Bump Stocks by executive order or Administrative Rule and he knows it. Trump won’t raise the age to 21 for AR-15 type weapons. This is all one huge con and MSM plays along.

3504 2018-02-27 02:25:21 On the contrary, if you understand how bumps stocks work, there is a massive functional difference. Secondly, a bump stock is a modification.  Continuing to appeal to emotion, on the basis of connotations is both dishonest and self serving.

3510 2018-02-27 02:23:24 No just the “political groups” who oppose common sense legislation  like the banning of bump stocks. If we can’t agree that bump stocks need to be off of our street then we’re speaking completely different languages.
3511 2018-02-27 02:22:44 NRA gave him permission to say it, but not do it. But you knew that already.

3519 2018-02-27 02:20:04 Those are good links, I buy into every word. My argument is on the statutes already law: GCA1968, NFA1934, FOPA1986. Gun registration,  machine guns, certain semi-auto guns. The other argument is over bump stocks - Trump says he wants a ban, I think it will pass.
3520 2018-02-27 02:19:59 I am a lifelong gun owner and have been an NRA member for over 20 years too, and if the NRA opposes restrictions on bump stocks then I will not be renewing my membership with those thugs.

3524 2018-02-27 02:18:46 So bitcoin has basically rallied from around 5500 to 11000, pulled back to around 9300 and is back above 10k. Pretty excellent action, right? Idiot Canadians still smashing crypto stocks, typically completely unaware of what is happening in the world. Thumbs up.
3525 2018-02-27 02:18:15 After 3 hrs of trade Tuesday:
- #ASX 200 +0.5%
- Index above 6000pts 
- 5th day of gains
- Mkt at fresh 3-week highs
- Telcos & Utilities only losers 
- 60% of stocks lifting 
#ausbiz
3526 2018-02-27 02:17:43 And don't pull any executive order, ruling by decree bullshit on bump stocks either. I didn't spend the last 8yrs bitching about Obama doing that to see our side start that shit.
3527 2018-02-27 02:17:35 Somewhere someone is 3d printing bump stocks, I’d bet.
3528 2018-02-27 02:17:32 Word from Gun groups is that @POTUS is thinking real hard about writing EO on Bumper Stocks In a press conference today, President Donald Trump said that, “I don’t care if Congress does it or not, I’m writing [so-called ‘bump stocks’] out myself.” This going against the #2A
3529 2018-02-27 02:17:32 @POTUS Mr President, with all due respect, you don’t have the authority to ban bump stocks. Don’t be like Obama.
3530 2018-02-27 02:16:30 Well sorry to hear that.. our pay has increased more and our stocks and 401 are doing great......and maybe the decline of isis didn’t happen in the last 12 months, but the decimation has
3531 2018-02-27 02:16:18 So 2 weeks after Parkland and a lot of empty talk, the Trump plan for addressing gun violence = direct Justice Department to look into bump stocks and some ridiculous suggestion about arming teachers. Wow.
3532 2018-02-27 02:16:00 Selling their stock won't put them under. You don't understand how the NRA works and you don't understand how stocks works. Do you understand what the job of your sheriff was? Hint....they were way more responsibile than the NRA...
3533 2018-02-27 02:15:39 Seems like the noise on stocks is even louder today than exactly one month ago, when SPX was 100 handles higher and at ATH-LOL.
3534 2018-02-27 02:14:40 atta boy. Now sell your Delta and UPS stocks
3535 2018-02-27 02:13:46 Bullshit, but I’ll give you facts.

NRA successfully lobbied to prevent laws to protect society from gun harm:

—prevented assault weapon ban
—prevented/advocated bump stocks (until late)
—fought for gun show loophole (won)
—fought against comprehensive background s 

=HARM
3536 2018-02-27 02:13:08 What is your stance on gun sense regulations, including banning bump stocks and semi-automatic weapons, raising minimum purchase age and universal background checks? #AskCA45
3537 2018-02-27 02:13:08 I’m sure the last FedEx Driver that drove down MLK Blvd. was concerned about # Bump Stocks
3538 2018-02-27 02:11:54 Come whenever... kabke Kwon ebok kijom hot wings atry stocks up on those and other stuff from work
3539 2018-02-27 02:11:53 Seriously are stocks even for sell anymore, feel like they all have been bought
3540 2018-02-27 02:10:48 Not bad.  Ahead of SPY500 by 2% annually over 5 years and 3% over 10.  It somewhat baffles me that I know a handful of investors, who through purchasing 3-10 stocks, have decimated most managers, and they don't do it professionally.  One close friend has done 30% for 10 years.
3541 2018-02-27 02:10:48 I admit to being a huge @realDonaldTrump supporter & voter. As such, I must say  @POTUS is ill-advised 2 continue his threat 2 ban bump stocks without congressional action! Why rebellious actions when bump stocks had nothing 2 do with Florida & no one wants to own one! Pause,Sir!
3542 2018-02-27 02:10:39 やっぱ取ったポジがうまいこと上昇すると楽しいな。お金は二の次や。
3543 2018-02-27 02:09:59 The President is backing off on banning bump stocks and raising the age limit for buying a rifle, while still pushing for arming teachers. How much did the NRA give him in order to make him change his mind? #NRABloodMoney #BoycottNRA
3544 2018-02-27 02:09:55 On an average day approximately 20 people are killed with a gun in the U.S. There's no outrage, and the mainstream media doesn't report it. Banning an AR-15 and bump stocks will do nothing to stop the gun violence. #ThingsPeopleShouldKnow
3545 2018-02-27 02:09:26 So after a lot of sound and fury, ultimately signifying nothing, we get Trump's Justice Department "studying" whether they can unilaterally ban bump stocks and some nonsense about state's arming teachers. Wow. To say this response is underwhelming is an exaggeration.
3546 2018-02-27 02:09:13 15,549 shooting deaths (this incl. suicide) in 2017. How about we set reducing that # by 1/3? Is that realistic? We can reduce it by getting agencies to share more info w/each other, raise the age level for owning firearms, no bump stocks, ban clips over 10 rounds, and so on.

3549 2018-02-27 02:08:57 Buy firearm stocks ..
Record number of firearms sales in 3,2,1. Learn this lession boy, ever action has an equal but opposite reaction. YOU and yours will drive weapons sales. Lol
3550 2018-02-27 02:08:47 I don't know what I would do without that extra $50 I get in each pay check...maybe I can buy stocks

My stocks have grown by like 1000%...but 1000% of 0 is still 0...

And btw, the decline of ISIS didn't just happen in the past 12 months.

I could get used to all this winning
3551 2018-02-27 02:08:12 @cromwellc please work with brokers and clearing firms to make it easier to deposit penny stocks. Jobs Act and Reg A+ encourage small cap formation but those investors need to have access to liquidity -and need to deposit shares to achieve that liquidity.
3552 2018-02-27 02:07:54 The fact of the matter is that @POTUS could eliminate bump stocks- increase waiting period- strengthen background checks- 100% more than 44 did- and it won’t be enough for these snowflakes. #freepassfor44 #MSMblasts45 @PaulObrienUSA @MartyMarty222
3553 2018-02-27 02:07:49 Bump stocks into the hands of civilians. I'm also a supporter of responsible gun ownership, and people who don't understand the weight of that responsibility shouldn't own guns, especially automatic assault weapons manufactured for combat.
3554 2018-02-27 02:07:26   and the stocks rise.
3555 2018-02-27 02:06:56 When will tron get back to 30 cents?  I would hope right along with the next crypto craze.  
Where did the money from the 800 billion market cap go?  300 plus billion!  Not to stocks, silver or gold.

3557 2018-02-27 02:06:09 Not true. The 1994 Federal Assault Ban banned specific types of guns such as AR15s, MAC10s, & TEC9s, but it also forbade possession of rifles & handguns that featured two or more military-style modifications (pistol grips, oversize magazines, and folding stocks, for example).

3561 2018-02-27 02:05:32 5 Months since the Oct.1 shooting and their still “talking” about banning bump stocks.  #BanAssaultRifles #bumpstocks #Enough
3562 2018-02-27 02:05:16 I actually disagree. There isn't evidence of government guarantee of propping up these particular stocks (they certainly won't admit they are emperor; so won't prop up these). It's sunspot coordination. I agree the market is a policy one. Just these stocks are a different story.
3563 2018-02-27 02:04:57 @OTCMarkets please work with brokers and clearing firms to make it easier to deposit penny stocks. Jobs Act and Reg A+ encourage small cap formation but those investors need to have access to liquidity -and need to deposit shares to achieve that liquidity.
3564 2018-02-27 02:04:55 Great night with @theshredlounge and @MTNG thx again fellas! #shreddnation #stocks #alwayslearning #NeverGiveUp #ATTACKthePROCESS
3565 2018-02-27 02:04:53 Making bump stocks illegal is going to be interesting, because it's all but a done deal.
I don't ask you to care what me and my father did, but be respectful, and I'll be of you.
3566 2018-02-27 02:03:55 No civilian NEEDS semi automatic weapons of bump stocks in their lives.
3567 2018-02-27 02:03:39 Time will tell, don't think its a pump and dump. It had a run, just like all the other stocks. Matica is now down huge vs its peak. many are. I'd rather buy while there is blood in the streets
3568 2018-02-27 02:03:38 Guess the stocks of FedEx have dropped substantially today too. Anyone know how much?
3569 2018-02-27 02:03:12 He’s having Justin Thomas in to talk to the kids about playing through adversity
3570 2018-02-27 02:02:48 Conor’s 100% right here. It’s pointless. If people and teacher pension funds pulled out of indexes that held gun stocks, that would make change quickly.
3571 2018-02-27 02:02:32 @Costa4NY I just learned that @NYSLRS has nearly $10 million invested in the publicly trade stocks of #gun manufacturers, mostly $OLN & $RGR. Will you pressure them to #divest? @drainthenra #BoycottNRA
3572 2018-02-27 02:02:30 I own 19 and I’m not renewing my membership. They don‘t care about anything but more gun sales. Bump stocks? This NRA ain’t your father’s NRA.
3573 2018-02-27 02:02:29 I don't think they should be banned. I don't see any real purpose for them. I just don't think there's sufficient reason to make them illegal. That said, I'd like to see a source for that as well. Pistol braces were developed for disabled vets, etc. But bump stocks?
3574 2018-02-27 02:01:49 "No one's saying that"
"Here's people saying that."
"Bots?"
LOL
Anyway, my videos on Parkland have talked about age requirements, bump stocks, assault weapons, background checks & mental illness, I  specifics.
3575 2018-02-27 02:01:07 I always enjoy watching American Greed to see terrible people taken down for robbing folks but the WorldCom ep makes me all sad. My dad worked there when they went bankrupt and he lost all stocks and retirement, only salvaged some account from MCI for $70k to last them forever
3576 2018-02-27 02:01:03 We don't need more moments of silence, we need more moments of action to ban assault weapons, to ban bump stocks, to enact stricter gun laws.
3577 2018-02-27 02:00:20 I got a lot of eggs, soup stocks, spices, frozen chicken breast and veggies.
3578 2018-02-27 02:00:12 Belt loops and strings can be used in place of bump stocks, Father.  There are ways to jerry rig the rifle to make it fire like an automatic without the use of a bump stock.
3579 2018-02-27 02:00:03 I’m sure he has lots of stocks....
3580 2018-02-27 01:59:08 Hey @CoryBooker, the #NewJersey Investment Council currently holds ~$700 million in publicly traded stocks in #gun manufacturers, mostly $OLN, makers of the Winchester Rifle. Will you pressure them to #divest? @drainthenra #BoycottNRA
3581 2018-02-27 01:59:02 I’d say I’m a great investor, ain’t talk stocks though 
3582 2018-02-27 01:58:48 How about banning the military style weapons on which bump stocks fit?  Two birds one stone.
3583 2018-02-27 01:58:07 @tomhanks just finished Uncommon Type, great stuff!!
3584 2018-02-27 01:57:58 @WarrenBuffett drop FedEx and Amazon Stocks please. Lives are more important  than dollars. 
You know that's True. Be a leader in this fight back to Sanity.
3585 2018-02-27 01:57:42 Owning social media stocks can both be awesome and painful.  Really tests your trading resolve.
3586 2018-02-27 01:57:42 A) Machine guns are illegal.  
B) The AR15 is NOT a machine gun.
C) Unfettered?  In what universe?
D) If AR15 has no recoil as you say then explain bump stocks.
If you're going to argue a point it's best to study the facts otherwise people correct you & you lose credibility.
3587 2018-02-27 01:57:27 Why do you care so much about banning bump stocks? They're ridiculous and no citizen needs one. Are you just being paid by the NRA? Come on Austin, be truthful.
3588 2018-02-27 01:57:14 So, to show the GOP he meant business, his admin approved bump stocks.  Way to go! He sure did do a lot.
3589 2018-02-27 01:56:15 The 2nd Amendment was created to protect Americans from a tyrannical government. I see evidence of tyranny in the FBI. Don't raise the age or take away bump stocks from the law abiding. @POTUS
3590 2018-02-27 01:56:14 **FedEx stocks went way up since your #HoggWash campaign against them started.  
3591 2018-02-27 01:55:50 Bump stocks aren't the only problem, please also ban all guns. I would like to not be shot.
3592 2018-02-27 01:55:21 Trade with the force, Not against it #stocks
3593 2018-02-27 01:54:52 A sane position on gun control is banning bump stocks and improving background checks, not reclaiming every semi automatic rifle in America (almost all of them). I’m not against reasonable regulations as long as it doesn’t affect my rights, only those of potential threats.
3594 2018-02-27 01:54:39 I’m sure you’re right. Gonna be burning through their stocks of energy bars tonight.
3595 2018-02-27 01:54:24 Trump: I'll ban bump stocks
DoJ: Nope.
Trump: Imma gonna raise the purchase age.
NRA: No you're not. Also, you need to legalize silencers and pass nationwide concealed-carry reciprocity.
Trump: Okay!
3596 2018-02-27 01:53:46 Bump stocks are not weapons. They are accessories, and the ATF can have an opinion about those.
3597 2018-02-27 01:53:34 Yes- it lets us identify the targets for primary challenges and where to spend our donations to help unseat these fools! Bear in mind - NRA/Guns Rights people 33%, other 66% want assault rifles, and bump stocks banned. As a corporation I would side with the majority.
3598 2018-02-27 01:53:10 @GOP @INDems @TheDemCoalition @indianagop @SenateGOP @INHouseGOP @WhiteHouse @HouseGOP IT IS TIME TO TAKE ACTION with COMMON SENSE legislation
1. Universal Background checks
2. Raise age to purchase firearms
3. Ban assault rifles, bump stocks,etc
4. Oppose arming educators
3599 2018-02-27 01:53:00 Easy for you to say from the comfort of your living room.   But even so, a country that is debating whether private citizens should be allowed to carry assault rifles with bump stocks?  A tad fucked up, no?
3600 2018-02-27 01:52:53 Lol I don't believe people need bump stocks or ar15. But similar to putting air marshals on flights,  I think we could put conceal marshals in schools. That's a realistic idea to try.
3601 2018-02-27 01:52:32 Trump negotiates like Kramer on Seinfeld. He probably got free bump stocks for life.
3602 2018-02-27 01:52:08 Just bought an AR15 and NRA membership. Suck it up buttercup. My FedEx stocks went up today. Thanks.
3603 2018-02-27 01:52:05 I know that its crypto but i thought i that since it has a ticker that it could be seen in stocks 
3604 2018-02-27 01:51:05 I'm not willing to give anything to the anti-gunners. If you give an inch they'll take a mile, and nothing will ever be enough for them. If you think they'll stop at bump stocks or even an assault weapon ban, then you're either ignorant or stupid.
3605 2018-02-27 01:50:57 I have no issues with stocks they are doing just fine .. and that is if you have invested in diversified portfolio
3606 2018-02-27 01:50:38 Came here especially for the Curriculum of Cuisine charity and the gluten free teriyaki. . First time here but was heartbroken to find the only gf beer not in stock.  Every time a bar that stocks gf beer is out, a gluten free angels wings get ripped off. It’s true.
3607 2018-02-27 01:49:38 Bump stocks were already banned, then Obama’s ATF brought them back to help disabled people be able to shoot better. Go figure. As soon as that came out, the Las Vegas story disappeared, for that and “other” reasons.
3608 2018-02-27 01:49:37 It's true. Bump stocks are spray and pray items.
3609 2018-02-27 01:49:30 Bump stocks on what??
3610 2018-02-27 01:49:25 It's also important to learn how other asset classes work. Many $Crypto guys cut their teeth trading stocks or forex first. 
Ask why will this 'moon'? Is it because of some value it brings to the world or just speculation? Value = get in early using TA. Spec = Wait for catalyst.
3611 2018-02-27 01:49:25 If I had stock, no I wouldn’t sell. The Trump economy is making my portfolio better. Go into the real world before mouthing off on stocks, Junior.
3612 2018-02-27 01:48:39 @CNN @FoxNews @cbs @abc @nbc #Trump says today he took on the NRA. The truth is that he conferred with Lapierre and together they agreed the least that might placate the public & get them to forget would be to propose restricting bump stocks. He hasn't yet done that. Talks cheap

3631 2018-02-27 01:43:31 Such a tool. Making bump stocks illegal? REALLY? trumps throwing mass shooting victims a bone. Banning bump stocks was supposed to be done after the Las Vegas massacre...what else ya going to do drumpf!! NOTHING, the NRA is in your back pocket!!
3632 2018-02-27 01:43:25 Buy some @FedEx stocks quickly #ThankMeLater 
3633 2018-02-27 01:43:11 Counterpoint: when people buy stocks they understand they may lose money. Why should investing in real estate be different? (And whose money would ultimately pay those who lost out buying real estate high?)
3634 2018-02-27 01:42:58 Thats the problem no one wants to do everything the only thing coming out of everyones mouth is ban guns ban clips ban stocks but no one mentions the PROBLEM, the gun is just the tool used, but we need to get to the root of the problems or nothing will change or stop
3635 2018-02-27 01:41:44 banning bump stocks is a meaningless concession
3636 2018-02-27 01:41:36 Still wondering....WHY do we need bump stocks/automatic upgrades for guns? Seriously, nobody I've had convos with can ask that...it'd be fun as hell to shoot at targets with the PROPER TRAINING & SAFETY MEASURES, but still...WHY do we need them?
3637 2018-02-27 01:40:07 Yes they did, knowing all that.  Trump is @POTUS and is keeping his campaign promises.  He was a Dem for years and the Dems could support his gun proposals, e.g.,ban bump stocks, raise age limits on ARs,  or his proposal  to grant citizenship to 1.8M Dreamers.
3638 2018-02-27 01:39:22 I think it can be done with executive action through BATFE. They only need reverse their earlier ruling that bump-stocks are not a device that converts an AR or AK type firearm into a machine-gun.

Next question... what about the devices already out “in the wild?” Can’t ban them.
3639 2018-02-27 01:38:58 I just asked a question. Why are you so defensive? I wasn't disrespectful. I didn't insult your beliefs. For all you know I could be for better background checks, no bump stocks and limiting the age of a potential gun buyer.
3640 2018-02-27 01:38:51 Guess @davidhogg111 is a drop out then. When you get a national audience and make threats, you look like an idiot if you don't follow through. But thanks for sending gun stocks and sales skyrocketing again. Best gun salesman since #Obama.
3641 2018-02-27 01:38:45 Thank you @MZHemingway 

" Trump said he’d unilaterally ban bump stocks. he has no Const. authority to do so. quiet from those who claim he’s authoritarian. B/c guns."

Ban Assault Weapons for purchase by Civilians of any age.
3643 2018-02-27 01:37:38 Clown News now relying on gun expert Niklas Hogg to explain bump stocks and President Trump's views on 21 year age limit
3644 2018-02-27 01:37:21 Reinstate assault weapons ban. Ban high cap mags, bump stocks and triggers that mimic full auto. Universal background checks. No gun show or internet sales.
3645 2018-02-27 01:36:57 Hey fedex, every little counts! I will boycott you until... NRA memberships is only less than 4 millions! Do the math! We will sell your stocks! #BoycottFedEx #BoycottNRA
3646 2018-02-27 01:36:07 It just gets better and better every. day. Can't wait until Trump outlaws bump stocks via EO and they are forced to challenge it and the 9th overturns it. The cognitive dissonance will explode their heads.
3647 2018-02-27 01:36:00 Don’t even ban bump stocks now.
3648 2018-02-27 01:35:40 Generally agree with you. Bump stocks allow an AR15 to fire 5-8 rounds per sec. We cant buy a machine gun--why allow this?
3649 2018-02-27 01:35:39 Even bump stocks are being left to a decision of the DOJ based on legal loopholes. He is weakening and the NRA knows it.
3650 2018-02-27 01:35:38 the NRA Sunday. What do you think he heard from them? On Monday he was emphatic about bump stocks, and armed teachers but no longer age.
3651 2018-02-27 01:35:37 emphatic statement of the solutions he would get behind. He was very emphatic on age, bump stocks, and armed teachers. He met with
3652 2018-02-27 01:35:09 Should ban what bump stocks are attached to.
3653 2018-02-27 01:35:04 As a leftie myself.  I’d say keep it in minor stocks. No need to spend investment on upgrading/updating. As long as there is an option we will be happy with it.
3654 2018-02-27 01:34:36 If you’re going to raise the age to buy rifles to 21 are we going to raise the age you can carry one and die for your country to 21 also?  Most of these evil doer mass shooters were much older. This is political pandering to the left. Same with bump stocks. They always want more
3655 2018-02-27 01:34:16 Bump stocks are a pacifying distraction. It helps to silence Gun grabbers a little, but should be moved on from, IMO.
3656 2018-02-27 01:34:13 Why can't conservatives understand that it not that people hate the NRA for supporting the 2nd amendment , they hate the because they oppose ridiculously common sense gun laws. Like bump stocks and background checks
3657 2018-02-27 01:33:28 So, killing is okay as long as it is done gently? Still waiting for you to explain bump stocks. We need to STOP the senseless American on American crime. O UNAMERICAN. Maybe you & I can debate how to do that? I say promote #Unity, not division. #BobLariveeForUSSenate
3658 2018-02-27 01:33:12 Like fuck it’s easy,,, Lamo but at least Kylie Jenner made their stocks plummet cuz of it maybe they will learn not to be FOOLISH
3659 2018-02-27 01:33:05 3) Besides the sweetheart warrants, Buffett didn’t buy stocks hand over fist in 2008-09 and has apologized to shareholders
3660 2018-02-27 01:32:05 Obviously another FALSE  FLAG attack perpetrated by the Deep State! That is why there are conflicting accounts! Again another move on their part to slowly strip away at the 2nd Amendment! I can’t believe our #POTUS is going to BAN “bump-stocks” because of LV? Wow! We R in “T”
3661 2018-02-27 01:31:12 First formal act was to plsy politics and investigate the cops actions..... NOT write EO banning stocks or ammo or gun.... sorry kids  u dont mean enough to ur government to be #1 priority #BanAssaultRifles #guncontrol #bumpstocks #FloridaShooting
3662 2018-02-27 01:30:44 401k's only grow faster, here, if they are primarily invested in European stocks & funds. Which is telling.
3663 2018-02-27 01:30:26 President Trump keeps shooting about gun control from his hips, he said, he pushes age limit to 21, background checks, and bump stocks then NRA says no, he keeps quite, he likes to talk about everything's without knowledge, he needs to control himself than gun control,
3664 2018-02-27 01:30:14 Sorry My family on numerous sides fought in the Rev War I am firmly behind the 2nd amendment but Bump stocks have no place in defense or hunting
3665 2018-02-27 01:30:02 If anyone is holding any FedEx stocks, it might already be too late to unload them. Better hurry.
Just a heads-up.
3666 2018-02-27 01:28:55 I just want a nigga that’s into stocks and real estate is that too much to ask for 
3667 2018-02-27 01:28:32 Pretty weak accusation with no real evidence. 1) the dude has made a 50 year career on buying stocks when out of favor.
3668 2018-02-27 01:28:17 Stocks just crazy, made another cnote today.  Just little by little bit need like $2,000 for@the month
3669 2018-02-27 01:27:47 If you make impulsive decisions or revenge trade to chase losses, you're gonna get burned.

If your P&L doesn't look good today - just close up the computer and come back fresh tomorrow

3670 2018-02-27 01:27:39 Still on the fence.   8 years to go to prove wrong this reference.    I don’t see bit coin defying common economic principles.   What would differentiate BC from any other commodities stocks or currencies.   As with all in early is good.  Hold and sell is harder.
3671 2018-02-27 01:27:35 @RalphNortham Governor what are you doing to protect Virginia citizens and schools from gun violence? Ban assault rifles? Ban bump stocks? Take guns away from domestic abusers?
3672 2018-02-27 01:27:21 @realDonaldTrump Here’s your chance to run into every school - raise the age to 21, ban bump stocks, better background checks for a start.  Make our kids safe at school! @senatorduff @jahimes
3673 2018-02-27 01:27:10 Sell those stocks.
3674 2018-02-27 01:26:53 Trump makes the same comments about NRA and bump stocks. Jeesh the gov of Georgia just threatened companies bc they’re taking away an NRA discount. - the influence of NRA is very open for debate
3675 2018-02-27 01:26:52 When you are talking about $2k here and $1.50 there, are those people holding stocks in Apple, Microsoft?  most likely not.  401k is seeing growth, but the significant growth is if you have a lot in there and most people depleted their 401k after 2008.
3676 2018-02-27 01:26:23 Everyday I wake up I ask for the spirit of the lord to guide me in picking my stocks because it is not by might or power but by the grace of our lord Jesus Christ.
3677 2018-02-27 01:25:32 99.9% people know you’re full of 
3678 2018-02-27 01:25:23 The stock has given a return of more than 100% since its listing of 22nd March and still people call its expensive. The irony is no one knows who is buying as the stocks hits life highs
3679 2018-02-27 01:24:58 Well, case in point, after the Last Vegas shooting, Congress tried to pass a bill banning bump stocks but the democrats kept adding to it. The ban was even supported by the NRA!
3680 2018-02-27 01:24:27 Don't tell @realDonaldTrump but folks can make "bump stocks" at home. If somebody wants a "bump stock", they can get one. Banning them does nothing. #NRA #2A
3681 2018-02-27 01:24:26 Eichenwald stated earlier he took all his kids education money out of stocks when Trump got elected, so he had to do SOMETHING with it.
3682 2018-02-27 01:24:22 I don't need your pity. I have a great job, a very loving fiancé, my President is in office, my 401k and stocks are booming and I love my family. You can keep your pity. You sound like you need it.
3683 2018-02-27 01:24:06 Nakakainis pag ubos ang stocks sobrang hindi makatarungan
3684 2018-02-27 01:23:44 @HonestReporting check out the story unfolding about #ClayTrader this could get big! 
3685 2018-02-27 01:23:38 Had your bill simply said ban bump stocks it would have passed the same day. You had to try for more though.
3686 2018-02-27 01:23:11 @FedEx bought more stocks today
3687 2018-02-27 01:22:53 Whether stocks can keep rallying may depend on how well Fed Chair Jerome Powell handles Congress on Tuesday.
3688 2018-02-27 01:22:42 Banning bump stocks will be as effective in stoping the next shooting horror as the Easter Bunny renewing his library card!!

3689 2018-02-27 01:22:18 @seanhannity they can ban bump stocks, Ar-15s, then get rid of the 2nd Amendment and take everyone's gun, and their will still be another shooting tomorrow.
3690 2018-02-27 01:22:12 @spartanpic70 yes I understand, but a bump stock also makes the gun extremely inaccurate. Also beyond that it has only been used in one crime (Steven paddock) since it was created around 10 years ago. The reason bump stocks aren’t used in crown much is due to their inaccuracy.

3698 2018-02-27 01:20:45 I'm glad this is getting pushed but bump stocks are really unpopular across the aisle. Even the NRA is against them so it's a pretend "meet in the middle" kind of thing to make it looks like the owned GOP are compromising when it's the exact opposite. Real action is what's NEEDED
3699 2018-02-27 01:20:29 and banning bump stocks is just going to increase sales of automatic weapons. More money for the @NRA. so fucked up.
3700 2018-02-27 01:20:25 @TuckerCarlson they can ban bump stocks, Ar-15s, then get rid of the 2nd Amendment and take everyone's gun, and their will still be another shooting tomorrow.
3701 2018-02-27 01:20:07 I'll give away my fucking firstborn before I hand off my precious bump stocks
3702 2018-02-27 01:20:05 Well I guess I'm against banning bump stocks cause I'm against anything you have your grubby hands on.
3703 2018-02-27 01:20:04 But stick to bump stocks don’t overreach
3704 2018-02-27 01:19:52 Thx Fedex will definitely buy ur stocks
3705 2018-02-27 01:19:45 @TuckerCarlson Trump says he would have gone inside the school had he been there. That's a lot of bluster if he really did so but why doesn't he exhibit the same by standing by the NRA instead of banning bump stocks & raising the gun buying age.
3706 2018-02-27 01:19:35 @TuckerCarlson you’re dead wrong if you think not one person believes that bump stocks shouldn’t be banned.  Are you a journalist or part of state run propaganda tv?  @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @SenSchumer @NancyPelosi @CNNPolitics @nytimes @maddow
3707 2018-02-27 01:19:13 @realdonaldtrump bump stocks do not solve anything and r not a game changer for an AR15  u r a thinker; quit reacting w/emotions

Time to sell stocks and buy bonds.
3709 2018-02-27 01:18:37 People also invest in stocks to make money not to prove political points
3710 2018-02-27 01:18:28 If this comforts the families, okay, but we want action and change, not moments of silence. We want a ban on AR-15s and bump stocks and armor-piercing bullets. We want Red Flag Laws.  Background checks for EVERY sale. NO watering down of state concealed-carry laws. Common sense.
3711 2018-02-27 01:18:15 Don’t ban bump stocks.
3712 2018-02-27 01:18:11 Banning bump stocks, upping the age limit, blaming the firearm, blaming the NRA ETC, is not going to stop mass shootings. Does the left want to find solutions, or are they just on a power trip?
3713 2018-02-27 01:18:05 @SenatorHeitkamp Also, support banning of all assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines!
3714 2018-02-27 01:16:33 They'll water it down to make bump stocks and binary triggers illegal, and cram it with enough pork to make it appetizing to rinos.
3715 2018-02-27 01:16:15 So what! Easily manipulated youth.
3716 2018-02-27 01:16:12 He thinks "bump stocks" has something to with the stock market.
3717 2018-02-27 01:15:53 So how many crimes were committed in DC using bump stocks? I am curious, this is a serious question.
3718 2018-02-27 01:15:34 This is going to have a major impact on the 10 people with bump stocks in DC
3719 2018-02-27 01:14:52 No, it's not. It's modified to fire fully automatic. Bump stocks are already being made illegal, and like .0001% of gun owners have a bump stock anyways. This video is completely disingenuous designed to scare dumb people who don't know anything about guns.
3720 2018-02-27 01:14:38 @realDonaldTrump we could use the gun reform ideas you promoted days ago, tied to concealed carry reciprocity. Age 21 sounds good, better background checks with more state info makes sense, kill bump stocks but fix patchwork of concealed carry partnerships like drivers license
3721 2018-02-27 01:14:36 its only because the NRA is against bump stocks or something
3722 2018-02-27 01:13:27 Why would Trump not have constitutional authority to ban bump stocks? Supreme Court has said it’s ok to ban (I’m paraphrasing) exceptional guns, that are not normal guns used for hunting, self-protection. NRA has misled members about 2nd Amendment, IMO.
3723 2018-02-27 01:13:24 OK. Now I’m getting angry. How dare a kid, that has no idea what it’s like to live in the real world, tell me what stocks to buy or sell. I’ve been working the stock market longer than he’s been alive. This brat needs a pacifier and a nap. #shutup
3724 2018-02-27 01:13:23 sell, take back 4000. Now you have 394 dollars to run stocks with that doesn't effect you at all :D thats what i'd do.. but ima pussy
3725 2018-02-27 01:12:59 So I'm just guessing for tomorrow:

Powell more dovish than expected means less rate hikes, stocks will rally. 

More hawkish than expected means inflation and robust economy, stocks will rally.

The bull narrative goes both ways, luckily
3726 2018-02-27 01:12:52 When will he learn no to sale his shares ? The same thing he did with apple stocks and he got #rekt
3727 2018-02-27 01:12:47 If my kid was in there I would to. You? Not do much
3728 2018-02-27 01:12:37 by tomorrow he'll forget bump stocks too
3729 2018-02-27 01:12:37 Bump stocks fire four hundred to eight hundred rounds per minute. Washington State Senate passed SBR 5992, which could outlaw bump stocks.

3732 2018-02-27 01:11:19 @johncusack Hi. Would you please respond to the Cheeto stating he is going to ban bump stocks no matter what Congress does. I have opinions, but it's so entertaining & educational reading it when you post it. Thank you!
3733 2018-02-27 01:11:11 You do realize that tens of millions of working people own hundreds of billions in stocks in retirement accounts and are shareholders?

3738 2018-02-27 01:08:39 Couldn't trump just do some executive orders he's so fond of to ban assault rifles, ban bump stocks, and more aggressive background checks ?

3740 2018-02-27 01:07:30 The AR-15 I don't really have much objection to any more than any other semi-automatic rifle, personally. Bump stocks are clearly taking the piss, though.
3741 2018-02-27 01:07:21 Bullish for stocks.
3742 2018-02-27 01:06:53 We get the left never gives up. Still, do the right thing for the country on bump stocks, universal background checks and assault weapons.

The big answer - keep majority in the House and take the Senate to 60 R votes

3745 2018-02-27 01:06:11 There’s no civilian use for assault rifles… same for high-capacity magazines, armor piercing bullets or bump-stocks… there is no civilian use for any of them… #NRA answer to Everything is “More Guns”… flood the country w/guns… now, they'll tell you that you need one too…
3746 2018-02-27 01:06:11 @AC360 #CNN  So, by your standard I guess Trump must state everyday and at every event that he wants to ban bump stocks and raise gun age. Otherwise he has gone silent and is cowtowing to NRA. #FakeNewsCNN
3747 2018-02-27 01:05:43 You need to moderate a bit.  Age of 21 for ARs is worth discussing and are bump stocks.  Though won't to stop next mass shooting, it will force the Left to look at the real causes of gun violence in America.  Looking into the mirror will not be pretty.
3748 2018-02-27 01:05:43 Now I need to convince my financial advisor to buy it. His company won’t buy stocks involved in Cannabis.
3749 2018-02-27 01:04:06 pass a bill for just banning bump stocks or anything similar.  Just do it.
3750 2018-02-27 01:04:06 Now the truth comes out.  Feinstein is DEMANDING legislation be passed on bump stocks to make them illegal so the NRA and law abiding gun owners can't tie up an EO in court for years like we are doing with Obama's EO granting amnesty to #DACA while they get to stay and VOTE!
3751 2018-02-27 01:03:57 Does he even think he is saying something here? He has not signed away bump stocks. He has not given Congress directive to act against bump stocks, which his son's best friend manufactures. He has directed DOJ to look into it,knowing Supreme Court ruled not power of DOJ to act on
3752 2018-02-27 01:03:41 Of course he is!  He never remotely meant that  He's throwing crumbs.  Just like the bump stocks, empty talk.
3753 2018-02-27 01:03:30 We should not need to explain to you that the problems with these semiautomatic carbines are: a) They can be modified to shoot automatically b) Bump stocks can be used to make the fire rate comparable to auto c) They can use high capacity magazines. You are a liar.
3754 2018-02-27 01:03:24 Irony is calling yourself a reformed broker while you spend your days touting stocks on CNBC.
3755 2018-02-27 01:03:17 Ive called and emailed the white house, to let the President know he will lose my vote if he passes any new gun laws. No compromise on any gun legislation, and that includes giving the atf power to interpret law, by banning bump stocks.
3756 2018-02-27 01:02:48 So bump stocks cause mass shootings, not someone mentally ill?
3757 2018-02-27 01:02:43 @DougPolkPoker you mention in a vid about RobinHood app involved into crypto...originally for stocks...it does impose a fee now correct?
3758 2018-02-27 01:02:33 Then #DoSomething and don’t punt on background checks and bumber stocks.  19101z
3759 2018-02-27 01:02:08 Pretty much, and right after the LA shooting Bump Stocks sold out everywhere, which means all these gun nuts knew they were on the list to be banned.
3760 2018-02-27 01:01:51 If you had to, order in which you'd sell FANG stocks?
3761 2018-02-27 01:01:07 Nevada shooting was a while back, why NOW all these politicians are banning the bump stocks???
3762 2018-02-27 01:00:32 A bill on top of another bill... only Democrats could waste taxpayers' money like that. Weapons that could use bump stocks are already banned in DC.
3763 2018-02-27 01:00:09 How will stocks react to Powell’s first speech as Fed chair?
3764 2018-02-27 00:59:45 To resist tyranny or to take part in the militia in a "total war" scenario where calling up the entire body of fighting capable citizens would overtax realizable military weapon stocks. E.g. if aliens attacked, a man with an AR-15 can fight interchangeable with one with an M4.
3765 2018-02-27 00:59:15 that's one item I can agree on and even the NRA is for some regulation on  bump stocks.
3766 2018-02-27 00:59:09 I'm totally on board with banning bump stocks and a much more extensive mental health evaluation, but my opinion is there are ways to prevent something like parkland that don't involve more gun laws
3767 2018-02-27 00:58:50 Never give in to the Progressive Left. NEVER! This #GunControl debate isn't a debate it's demands that we the American people give up our civil liberty rights for egalitarianism. You can ban bump stocks but that won't prevent the next mass killing
3768 2018-02-27 00:58:19 Plus good organizations dont allow assault rifles with bump stocks, or stop an age restriction laws. Comparing the two is apples and oranges.
3769 2018-02-27 00:57:43 My family supported your father throughout his campaign and into his presidency. However, if the President does not change his course of rhetoric towards gun laws, he will lose our votes. No compromise, including the unconstitutional banning of bump stocks.
3770 2018-02-27 00:57:26 "Tell Me Something I Dont Know"

3771 2018-02-27 00:56:42 I feel banning bump stocks and AR15 is not the answer, criminals are going to get it under ground. Then next it will be rifles, hand guns, knives, pressure cookers, vans. Mental illness awareness is what's going on. Stop them from getting anything! @realDonaldTrump
3772 2018-02-27 00:56:32 If they want to run their yaps on CNN, slander others, call for boycotts and dictate which stocks to buy, then be prepared for push back. If they can't take the heat, get their ass back to school and off CNN.
3773 2018-02-27 00:56:16 I guess my point and belief is that AR15 weapons-and bump stocks need to be banned period. Paddocks weapons were legal and Sandy Hook mass murder was also the result of legally owned guns by the mother. #BanAssaultWeapons
3774 2018-02-27 00:56:05 Right. Jobs aren't coming back. There is no tax break. Unemployment isn't down. Isis isn't destroyed. Stocks arent up. Gorsuch isn't on SCOTUS, MS-13 isn't being deported, Obama's regs aren't being repealed.... No one takes him serious 
3775 2018-02-27 00:55:45 @realDonaldTrump @VP @seanhannity @dbongino @SebGorka @foxandfriends  SO @POTUS  YOU can not do anything about Bump stocks unless the arrogant Cali Dem @SenFeinstein  says you can who does she think she is ?
3776 2018-02-27 00:55:28 Didn't notice the bump stock. My bad.
Bump stocks are a whole other can of worms. I know they aren't actually very good for the gun but people use them anyway more or less explicitly just to go around the Class 3 requirement. Which is really a loophole that should be closed.
3777 2018-02-27 00:54:49 Nothing. Stocks are volatile and are driven by investor sentiment, and, hopefully, the underlying fundamentals. Now that the FED is not propping up the Market, things will settle back into normalcy.
3778 2018-02-27 00:54:32 lets recap clinton passes the community reinvestment act making banks give bad housing loans to people who cannot pay them back.
eight years later the banks are all out of money from these bad investments.the dow tanks to 6000 people start to buy dirt cheap stocks .
3779 2018-02-27 00:54:30 Playing doubles with some ppl online, picked doc one game, custom skin.

3781 2018-02-27 00:53:52 Remember when you said "You can't yell fire in a crowded theater." in relation to Free Speech. Well, it's also illegal to get people to sell stocks in a defamatory way. Enjoy the lawsuits. #DavidHogg
3782 2018-02-27 00:53:52 I don't care about bump stocks, but I do care about caving to leftist lies and manipulation. That sets a bad precedent, best to give these people nothing, but take, or impose, as much as possible. Reopen the NFA registry. Nationwide reciprocity. Repeal the import ban.
3783 2018-02-27 00:53:47 hiii can you send sa dm ano orders mo? i'll check later if kakasya siya sa mga tingi na last stocks left ko 
3784 2018-02-27 00:53:27 PM Mkt Wrap/Close: Bonds closed the session near unchanged @ $102.44, yet stocks were strong with DowJ finishng at 25,709.27, +399.28.
3785 2018-02-27 00:53:19 It’s not... President Trump knows that bump stocks are about as worthwhile as tits on a bull, but the libtards don’t know that. Bump stocks are a cool toy but they really won’t make or break the Second Amendment. By doing this, he totally chops the Dems off at the knees
3786 2018-02-27 00:53:07 @SenFeinstein is pushing new legislation to ban bump stocks. Seriously? We do not need more gun laws. We need to enforce the laws that are already on the books. #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder
3787 2018-02-27 00:53:05 Protectorates, dependencies, territories of which there are many.
Same stuff we always sell. Cars weapons, chemicals, money, stocks aerospace etc etc. The same things that have kept us in the top flight all this time. Comon learn ffs
3788 2018-02-27 00:52:31 Do you support taking pressure off the wild stocks? I do. I think that is the ecological position.
3789 2018-02-27 00:51:44 #NeverAgain I called my senators and congressman today to ask for a ban on assault weapons, bump stocks, and request extensive background checks and to raise the age to buy a gun to 21. Did you call your people??
3790 2018-02-27 00:51:25 Bump stocks and Las Vegas prove that the distinction between semi-automatic rifles and their already-banned fully automatic analogs is meaningless and easily defeated.
3791 2018-02-27 00:51:25 lahat wala nang stocks
3792 2018-02-27 00:51:22 @jimcramer Thank you for speaking out on VIX.  It is not a product, you don't own stocks, bonds, or commodities.  You are buying a math formula.  Unlike stocks, bonds or commodities - YOU OWN NOTHING.  Regulators need to ban this.
3793 2018-02-27 00:51:04 Exactly 19 weeks ago every Dem and every Liberal and ALL their tv networks were calling for a ban on bump stocks, now Pres Trump is trying to get that done and now Dems and liberals are calling him an idiot, if you dont believe just read the tweets. Unbelivable hypocrties.
3794 2018-02-27 00:51:01 How often do you decide to long the ETF instead of the individual stocks within it? For example $C today
3795 2018-02-27 00:50:59 Why her legislation though, which bans far more than bump stocks. Disagree.
3796 2018-02-27 00:50:27 That might sound like a smart move to you at the moment, but understand, you might get bump stocks, and even I would vote for better background checks, but you`re not getting any gun ban. YOU know what the problem is, and YOU know it`s not the NRA. Liar.
3797 2018-02-27 00:50:18 Stocks did real well today
3798 2018-02-27 00:49:44 Oh sure, the lieutenant governor of the state that is working to dehumanize people in the LGBT community now wants everyone to have access to assault rifles in all probability with bump-stocks so some lunatic can be free to kill more of our nation's children and grandchildren.
3799 2018-02-27 00:49:31 If she offered a Bill that specified Bump Stocks only... Sure.
3800 2018-02-27 00:49:21 @tedcruz time to take action not money from the NRA......stop the blood shed and stand with the students of Stoneman Douglas....ban all automatic weapons and bump stocks...
3801 2018-02-27 00:49:19 Purchase Firearms Stocks. They will make u wheel barrows of $ if u can invest enough and invest correctly.
#Imvest in firearms and Firearm Stocks
3802 2018-02-27 00:49:16 Shocking new perspective today from @allstarcharts: U.S. stocks may be closer to the *beginning* of a major bull market than the end. Lots of charts to smartly back his opinion. Most bullish anecdotes I’ve seen in months. Definitely eye opening.
3803 2018-02-27 00:48:48 trump will have them investigate bump stocks, see theyre not machine gun (again) pass it along to congress to write a bill and redefine machine guns, it wont pass. freedom will reign.
or trump will come for our guns, make us all felons and as felons we can then make machine guns
3804 2018-02-27 00:48:36 I'm just gonna tweet it..it's spring training for stocks as well.
3805 2018-02-27 00:48:30 Ah ok, binabad ko pa ng breeze powder. Uniform ng anak eh.. Thanks bes. Di lang magaling sa stocks, pati sa labada pa hehehe
3806 2018-02-27 00:47:47 Really , so you oppose sensible gun control - no bump stocks, no assault rifle automatic one semi automatic , no sales to mentally ill people, min age 21 ?? You're a Sad person.
3807 2018-02-27 00:47:19 Great advice as always @WarrenBuffett and my biggest takeaway is do not borrow money to buy stocks #FinancialPlanning
3808 2018-02-27 00:47:05 The #NeverAgain crowd demands the sale of @FedEx stock today and it climbed $2.50. 
Making that company and its investors more money.

3810 2018-02-27 00:46:26 backgraound checks or on mental health number two get assault rifles of course on civilians on the street before they shoot or ban bump stocks:-)
3811 2018-02-27 00:45:14 Sir my case is like millions of indians who r frustrated with this non performing pm(npp). There is no chance of recovery but we need to correct our mistake in 2019
3812 2018-02-27 00:45:11 I don't think we can say that they wouldn't stop at nothing.   None of them bought their guns illegally to begin with.   Paddock even used legal bump stocks instead of finding an actual fully automatic.  Lanza was a unique case of mental disability.
3813 2018-02-27 00:45:00 Trump says he is "writing out" bump stocks
3814 2018-02-27 00:44:29 Great numbers on Stocks and the U.
3815 2018-02-27 00:44:18 My husband actually told me, as well as our daughters, who have IRAs, that NONE of our investments are in gun stocks.  It was good to know!
3816 2018-02-27 00:43:58 I've only done my investing on Coinbase so far.  So I watch BTC, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin.  Out of 5 investments, only one of my conventional stocks performs well.  The other 3 just idled, and one of them lost their(my) ass.
3817 2018-02-27 00:43:54 @FedEx let me EXpress myself: #ByeFelicia and let’s see how well your stocks respond to your continued sharing of the bed with @NRA #BoycottFedEx #FedEx #BoycottTheNRA #NRA
3818 2018-02-27 00:43:35 Keep in mind that even if a member of the NRA didn’t commit a mass shooting they still aren’t helping the issue by not trying to help fix the issue of bump stocks or 18 year olds from being able to buy a fucking war gun. You don’t need a war gun in civilian life.

3820 2018-02-27 00:43:16 Yes Mary if the 2nd Amendment was actually about the right to carry assault weapons, bump stocks etc. Check the history ( I know you won't ) but it wasn't until 1977 when a radical right wing took over the NRA that this whole NRA Lobby for All Guns , assault rifles etc happened.
3821 2018-02-27 00:43:04 It was never about bump stocks or Ar-15’s. It’s always been about the left exerting control and disarming the country.
3822 2018-02-27 00:42:53 Somebody messing with our stocks .
3823 2018-02-27 00:42:22 Let me guess. The bought their stocks back.
3824 2018-02-27 00:41:59 $spx closed at its high today. New highs for $amzn $NFLX and $AAPL $GOOGL not far from new highs. Financial stocks like  $GS also very strong. Very good signs of market health.
3825 2018-02-27 00:41:52 Invest in whatever stocks you think are a good investment.

3828 2018-02-27 00:40:59 Sell all the stocks of companies pulling out of NRA! They will run out of business and money very soon! Buying their stocks is like a sin, a heinous crime against your future generations and your country- as they are supporting leftist/terrorist agenda without any doubt! #MAGA
3829 2018-02-27 00:40:48 I have no idea how that's relevant to me knowing whether I can afford a car payment or not.  

Fraud on investors in the securities or the bank stocks, sure, relevant to those investors.
3830 2018-02-27 00:40:20 What other garbage are you putting in your bill that will make it a non-starter.  Then u can say they support bump stocks and want dead children.  We know your game.
3831 2018-02-27 00:40:16 1994 ar ban had a lot of useless "cosmetic" nonsense but it went waaaaaaaaaaaaay farther than a bump stock ban, I.E. 10 round mag limits. 2A people dont give a fuck about bump stocks, they're not going to make you deadlier, they just make your gun overheat faster
3832 2018-02-27 00:40:14 But see what she did there? All she had to do is say the president is RIGHT on banning bump stocks and only my bill can do that. But oh no. She had to say the president is WRONG even though they are trying to do the same thing. 
3833 2018-02-27 00:40:13 The @NRA rejecting @realDonaldTrump ‘s request on lifting the age to purchase bump stocks ... can’t wait till y’all see Jesus
3834 2018-02-27 00:39:47 Well, clearly you are either not aware or remiss in discussions regarding bump stocks & their capabilities?
3835 2018-02-27 00:39:43 Those are different issues.
Gun laws being discussed are about AR-15s and bump stocks' legality.
3836 2018-02-27 00:38:18 Bump stocks. You know, bump stocks? I called 'em that. Nobody knew what the hell to call 'em. They just said, thing that makes many bullets come out fast. So, you know, I came up with bump stocks... which is kind of a shame cause now we've gotta get of them.
3837 2018-02-27 00:38:00 Oh, please.   All he has to do is request the Justice Department to consider changing an already existing classification to include bump stocks and they are out of play under existing law.  Authority so to do already passed by Congress.  Learn your Civics please.
3838 2018-02-27 00:37:57 BUY @FedEx stocks.
3839 2018-02-27 00:37:57 I tried. It's Incoherent jibberrish. Is he saying we get rid of bump stocks? Or is he saying we don't need to? Oh & ask the 58 killed in Las Vegas how much it mattered that they aren't accurate? #Resist
3840 2018-02-27 00:37:51 Did you keep up with gun stocks during the Obama years?  Buy, you fool.  Buy.
3841 2018-02-27 00:37:46 If this is the best you can offer to a very serious situation it’s sad. What legislation was passed by dems to reduce school shootings.
? bump stocks were banned...no, trumps doing it. Machine guns were banned, no Reagan did it.
3842 2018-02-27 00:37:07 So just a quick question, so banning  bump stocks is going to solve the mass shootings?
3843 2018-02-27 00:37:04 The Law states that all children are to receive a Free Appropriate Education.   THIS SCHOOL WAS OUT OF COMPLIANCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Oh ya, Bump stocks can be made in your basement in a half an hour.
3844 2018-02-27 00:37:00 What MOST Americans say:

- We need better background checks.
- We need common-sense gun laws.
- We should probably ban assault rifles & bump stocks.

What the #NRA & #conservatives hear:

- We're coming for all your guns!!!
- Bow down to TYRANNY!!!

#crazy #insanity #guns
3845 2018-02-27 00:36:49 Bump stocks. You know, bump stocks? I called 'em that. Nobody knew what the hell to call 'em. They just said, thing that makes many bullets come out fast. So, you know, I came up with bump stocks... which is kind of a shame cause now we've gotta get of them.
3846 2018-02-27 00:35:23 MSNBC: "40% of all guns sell without a background check. Instead of a no-fly list why not a no-buy list. trump's making an issue of bump-stocks when they were not in play; as they were months ago in Las Vegas. trump is simply kicking the can down the road." Gov. Daniel Malloy, CT
3847 2018-02-27 00:35:01 For 8 years of an Obama presidency, many on the right were all like ‘that atheist Muslim Kenyan is gonna steal my guns!!!’

Trump: maybe we ban bump stocks, raise the age to 21, and take guns from some people. 

Same dudes on the right: MAGA!!!!

3849 2018-02-27 00:34:29 Most ammo for rifles is sold in 20 rd boxes just more convient then having loose ammo laying around in my opinion theres a lot of room for gun enforcement and checks, i dont agree with a gun ban, bump stocks serve no use other than fun or if in wrong hands disaster
3850 2018-02-27 00:33:44 money is the root of all evil every one can buy a gun hope banning bump stocks works but wat about patriots which by the way are  called  people having guns in good hands:-)hehe and tnks to POTUS on new sanction to n. korea (less trade which means less money on nukes:-)hehe
3851 2018-02-27 00:33:18 You can STILL defend your freedoms without assault weapons and bump stocks. They are NOT mutually exclusive scenarios and to say so is to intentionally inflame an already polarized group. There is a third alternative. NRA just won't admit it. Money mindset.
3852 2018-02-27 00:33:00 Ingram has been the PG for 9 games now. In those games, he's averaging 18.3 PTS, 4.7 REB, 5.6 AST, and 1.5 Stocks. 53% overall,  54.5% from 3, 80% from the FT line. 62% TS and 58% EFG%. Let's see if that success continues tonight
3853 2018-02-27 00:32:58 Banning bump stocks is hardly eradicating the 2nd Amendment and probably would have saved many lives in Vegas.
3854 2018-02-27 00:32:52 For the record: Bump stocks are a fucking joke. Zero ability to stay on target, and a amazing waste of ammunition. They were a novelty for a few folks that wanted the experience. No rational person puts one on their rifle for routine use or defense.

Only lefty nutcases who kill.
3855 2018-02-27 00:32:51 In stats & the guy to my right is making money from his stocks, and I’m just looking at memes. Boys always win
3856 2018-02-27 00:32:43 6) Now, the DoJ says, "Upon further review and consulting our experts, we believe that it takes an act of Congress to ban bump stocks." JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH DACA.
3857 2018-02-27 00:32:26 Healthcare companies stocks have quadrupled under the ACA (Obamacare) and the insurance companies still receive billions in subsidies. 2016 healthcare lobbying spending, $152 million.
3858 2018-02-27 00:32:08 Pretty good day off of work. Made 50 off of lottery tickets and another 120 from stocks 
3859 2018-02-27 00:31:34 The single action that will save lives is an outright ban on assault weapons. Anything less like purchase age, bump stocks, armed teachers and mental health are just NRA distractions.
3860 2018-02-27 00:31:33 Exactly correct. He could ban bump stocks tomorrow.  Idiot America now thinks Trump is doing something about guns.
#idiotAmerica
3861 2018-02-27 00:30:31 The only answer remains banning assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Anything less is just lip service to the NRA. Be a real man and really make America Great.
3862 2018-02-27 00:30:22 While we're getting rid of bump stocks why don't we include silencers, which are legal in 42 states?
3863 2018-02-27 00:29:22 Is the rest mostly trying to prove your kids are better than theirs?  Or about stocks?  Just want to be ready.
3864 2018-02-27 00:29:13 3) His messaging is simple. "Bump stocks are bad." Fine, no one gives a flying fuck about bump stocks. He's framing it to people as if no one would care if bump stocks were banned. Even the NRA is cool with bump stocks being banned.
3865 2018-02-27 00:28:59 I plan to buy FedEx stocks!
3866 2018-02-27 00:28:57 Gun stocks seems to be doing well.
3867 2018-02-27 00:28:18 @MZHemingway Saw you on Special Report panel. The need to make common sense changes on issues like background checks, bump stocks, school security, separate from recent shooting, is not "confusing" to me. It is to you?
3868 2018-02-27 00:28:04 No idea.  But I refuse to be silent and sit idly by as more children are slaughtered at school because some people love their bump stocks and assault rifles more than they love innocent lives.
3869 2018-02-27 00:27:46 "He's just running out the clock. If he was worried about bump stocks, why didn't he talk about that during Nevada?" @DanMalloyCT on Trump's gun control proposals. #Hardball
3870 2018-02-27 00:27:29 At least he is taking about doing something. Banning bump stocks, looking into arming teachers who are already proficient gun users. Discussing raising the age to buy weapons.What did your president (Obama) do, during the 10 mass shootings that happened on his  watch? NOTHING!!!
3871 2018-02-27 00:27:11 I get the impression he just likes to say "bump stocks."
3872 2018-02-27 00:27:04 If corporations want to put their money where their mouth is, they will fight the sale of military grade assault weapons like the AR-15, with high-capacity cartridges and bump stocks.  Looks like @Delta did just that.
3873 2018-02-27 00:26:29 So wrapping the day up: Stocks went up (thanks @realDonaldTrump ), Sheriff Israel still has not resigned, Hillary still not locked up, Dems still lying, my NRA membership still active, Bible still exists, no one in jail, & Flag still flying. #LockThemAllUp No wall up either. #NRA
3874 2018-02-27 00:25:15 Bump stocks are basically the firearms equivalent of spinning rims, I wouldn't be surprised if it was passed as a basically useless symbol
3875 2018-02-27 00:25:07 They told him to sacrifice bump stocks for the betterment of mankind... but not to mention guns or give an inch to CDC studies on gun violence.
3876 2018-02-27 00:24:38 Universal background checks, no guns for convicted criminals / mentally ill, cannot buy a gun until age 21, limits on high-capacity magazines & assault weapons, outlaw bump stocks. Does not infringe on the 2nd amendment but would limit mass killings. Only USA has this problem.
3877 2018-02-27 00:24:34 Wait did Trump really say he’s banning bump stocks?
Is the conservative republican side imploding yet??
3878 2018-02-27 00:24:00 Lol that’s funny. The DNC is dead broke, because they poverty pimp their constituents... stocks?? LMAO
3879 2018-02-27 00:23:36 @DLoesch @NRA @NRA looks like @realDonaldTrump is going up against you. Age 21 to own/purchase a gun, no bump stocks. "Don't worry about the NRA. Apparently #POTUS is not afraid of going up against the #NRA
3880 2018-02-27 00:23:35 Classic 'push poll' that reflects most people see there's a problem.

To me sensible means focusing on the things that seem to contribute most to the problem - automatic guns, bump stocks, high round mags, incomplete background checks.  All the usual ingredients to massacres.
3881 2018-02-27 00:23:28 I get the impression @realDonaldTrump thinks "bump stocks" are those rails along the stage that keep guys from groping strippers.
3882 2018-02-27 00:23:10 Let me call this now. Trump will DO NOTHING as usual. This is strategic talk and I really hope I'm wrong! Also banning bump stocks doesn't come close to solving the problem!
3883 2018-02-27 00:22:08 I plan to biy FedEx stocks!
3884 2018-02-27 00:21:34 WRONG! The National Firearms Act prohibits automatic weapons and bump stocks turn guns into an automatic weapons. 

#Trump has as DUTY to faithfully execute the laws of the United States by banning bump stocks!

3888 2018-02-27 00:20:51 It is accurate. It's against the UCMJ to participate in a political campaign while in uniform... Politicians must sell off their stocks to prevent conflicts of interests. It's the same principle. Or you support conflicts of interest? Parties divide loyalty away from constituents.

3890 2018-02-27 00:20:04 We need legislative action to ban assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, and bump stocks that are used to create machine guns. Our students, educators, families, and communities are counting on Congress to take action and I intend to deliver, because enough is enough.
3891 2018-02-27 00:19:19 The answer lies in the unseen temperature readings of what is going on under the hood of large sample size stocks that make a market
3892 2018-02-27 00:18:01 Regarding #2A and #NeverAgain I support:

- Better background checks
- Raising the age to purchase firearms to 21 (For the same reasons pot and booze are 21+)
- More funding for mental health research and aid
- Bans on modifications that exploit loopholes (Bump Stocks being one)
3893 2018-02-27 00:17:27 Trump said he’d unilaterally ban bump stocks. he has no Const. authority to do so. quiet from those who claim he’s authoritarian. B/c guns.

3895 2018-02-27 00:16:55 And it took me less time to sell all their stocks, I wont put my money in them
3896 2018-02-27 00:16:43 Good trading mostly stocks. Lost on a couple so I'm trying to inch my way back up.
3897 2018-02-27 00:16:40 Everything pot stocks is crashing hard. No end in sight
3898 2018-02-27 00:16:26 Yes. I apologize. The good news is everyone know what I "key" on. Stocks like $NFLX. And, there is no $NVLX ticker. But I love that $NFLX!
3899 2018-02-27 00:16:21 Not true and you know it. The bump stocks are not an issue, just want to know when they were used in a shooting. Back ground checks yes! I have a LTC, and it should be a no brainer to make sure mental health stability is in the forefront.
3900 2018-02-27 00:16:08 Stocks have bounced back from the recent historic sell off. Hope everyone benefited in some way.
3901 2018-02-27 00:15:55 You didn’t tell us Vic so we can buy some stocks smh
3902 2018-02-27 00:15:43 These cases don't prove policy market though; more like #SunSpot equilibrium: investors forming coordinating expectations about what each other will buy around an irrelevant event. Semi-jokes about people buying these stocks went the round last weekend, before market opened.
3903 2018-02-27 00:15:36 #Stocks making the biggest moves #afterhours: Fitbit, Nutrisystem, Palo Alto & more
3904 2018-02-27 00:15:35 Jim Cramer chooses key stocks and events for investors to keep an eye on in the week ahead.
3905 2018-02-27 00:15:20 What’s wrong with letting investors choose? Shareholder litigation is extremely expensive for what it delivers. Maybe arbitration stocks would have higher values.
3906 2018-02-27 00:13:35 Bump Stocks a non-issue. Average person can get same results with a stiff finger and relaxed shoulder-weld. Accuracy goes out the window, just as it does with bump-stock. We voted 4 you to defend #2A , not compromise. Check his PHARMACEUTICALS, if your wallet has the courage.
3907 2018-02-27 00:13:34 Yah and your bill will be loaded with a bunch of other crap that we don’t want. Why not a one bill that only bans bump stocks?
3908 2018-02-27 00:12:59 Yeah this market is ridiculous lol. It makes conventional stocks look small. Are you looking out or heard of anything else that's good?
3909 2018-02-27 00:12:57 Oh yea...that's right @davidhogg111 This is supposed to be about #SchoolSafety NOT #boycotts and #stocks #CameraHogg
3910 2018-02-27 00:12:18 GOOD FOR HIM,, THE BUMP STOCKS HAS TO GO AND HE DID THE TRICK. RIGHT AWAY. LETS GO  TO THE NEXT PLATEAU.  GET THE SCHOOLS COVERED SO NOONE GETS HURT,.
3911 2018-02-27 00:12:11 Yes bump stocks are a novelty item, and crazy people can still get their hands on guns if denied the ability to purchase. (The NRA argument btw) Cruz couldn’t have been more transparent about his intentions. They didn’t need 24/7 monitoring, they just needed one person to listen.
3912 2018-02-27 00:11:16 Aren’t these for science advisory officials to brief DFO on actual science related to stocks and not politicians so they can keep the political spin out of it? If he cared about stocks he would have pushed for EIS of Greig from the start!
3913 2018-02-27 00:11:01 Mr. President, you were elected as a friend of the second amendment.  You and the NRA both sold out.  Please research bump stocks, its nothing more than an accessory.  I can accomplish the same thing with my finger.  The current NICS is sufficient.  @realDonaldTrump
3914 2018-02-27 00:10:31 Same. For about a month or so. Lately I've been taking off with it though with those Cryptos i mentioned. Looking to put more in soon. I dabbled in conventional stocks for a while too. Nothing too serious.. little bit here and there. I didn't get very far.
3915 2018-02-27 00:10:15 Looking forward to the #pmcapitaladviserforum in @brisbanecityqld today! Investment insights in current and future market conditions and global stocks to watch. #ausbiz @AustraliaFPA
3916 2018-02-27 00:09:19 A local judge feller by the name of Jeremiah Kyle wants the public to vote on whether or not the whole shower of’em should be placed in the stocks
3917 2018-02-27 00:09:11 Makes sense from a narrative perspective - folks chase performance into the quarter-end print. Esp when you think about their underperformance in this rebound (HF have cut exposure to stocks)
3918 2018-02-27 00:08:15 European stocks rose on Monday, aided by comments from ECB chief Mario Draghi where he emphasised the euro-zone economy still needed stimulus.
3919 2018-02-27 00:08:08 @stephenfhayes Doesn't it bother you that Trump says he is going to ban bump stocks with his "pen and phone"?
3920 2018-02-27 00:07:57 Here's an idea to make sure wages scale with economic growth... Make companies pay their employees a living wage and a proportional set of stocks/share. When the company grows, so does the value of an employee's shares.
3921 2018-02-27 00:07:41 US stocks rose for a third-straight session on Monday, as investors became increasingly confident new Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell would not 'frighten the horses' in testimony to Congress later this week.
3922 2018-02-27 00:07:37 I dont like bump stocks, but i dont like the bump stock ban either. Its a slippery slope. If we dont stand up to every infraction against the 2nd Amendment, it will eventually be taken from us. @realDonaldTrump please do not pass a #bumpstockban.
3923 2018-02-27 00:07:07 Please look at the new replacement for bump stocks also!!
3924 2018-02-27 00:06:58 Yo if you want some free stocks hit me up
3925 2018-02-27 00:06:50 Asia stocks begin positive as global stock rebound continues, with region tracking gains on Wall St. where falling yields eased some fears of sharp rate increases, while Nikkei 225 outperforms on rebound in USD/JPY
3926 2018-02-27 00:06:36 I can't believe your analogy about United. So gun manufacturers and parts supplers  should be sued for making finger print resistant grips or bump stocks.
3927 2018-02-27 00:06:24 Gun control efforts @NRA FL lobbyist is opposing 
1. Waiting period on long guns 
2 Raising age limits on purchasing long guns
3. Age limits on possessions of semi automatic rifles
4. Ban of assault weapons
5. Ban on Bump stocks
3928 2018-02-27 00:06:20 Sooo when @realDonaldTrump talks about banning bump-stocks, expanding background checks, and raising the age for ownership isn’t he essentially taking guns away from people? The guy the @nra gave money to is doing this. You should stop sending him money........
3929 2018-02-27 00:05:55 Not true, @NRA was among the first to support legislation on bump stocks after #VegasMassacre , meanwhile PP does promote abortions I witnessed personally
3930 2018-02-27 00:05:38 No more bump stocks!? Very dissapointed!!.. as the smartest president, I thought you will be more creative. Like, how about we give the theachers hand granades and flamethrowers!!..
3931 2018-02-27 00:04:15 NRA used to be a decent organization, back in the 70s and 80s. Now they Focus on buying off politicians so they can make their profits. Bump stocks? Yeah that should’ve never been legal in the first place.  #BoycottNRA
3932 2018-02-27 00:04:02 Wow this sounds hopeful. Soon Trump will raise the age to 21 , ban bump stocks that turns rifles into assault weapons which means he will ban assault weapons. This would be a minimum good start & prove Trump isn’t in the pockets of the NRA.
3933 2018-02-27 00:03:59 I do not support banning bump stocks.
3934 2018-02-27 00:03:47 Now that the stock market is rebounding, I wonder if it is because of President Obama again. #Stocks #DowJones #MAGA #Trump #TaxCuts #ItsTheEconomyStupid
3935 2018-02-27 00:03:36 Still better than me. I have my 401k in moderately aggressive stocks appropriate for my age range. I'll be damn if I know what they are.
3936 2018-02-27 00:03:22 Lol and he'll get it. Cling to your stocks tighter, that comfort blanket's days are numbered too.
3937 2018-02-27 00:02:41 Nobody has used bump stocks in any of the attacks. Why are we banning them? Instead of banning we need to be buying crypto and screwing off the banks
3938 2018-02-27 00:02:37 Of course he did. They have no intention of banning bump stocks or assault weapons. They’re strategizing on how to defeat Feinstein’s bill.
3939 2018-02-27 00:01:08 When Trump said he would write it in if congress didn’t act(bump stocks) kind of reminded me of Obama’s phone and pen remark
3940 2018-02-27 00:00:52 Donald Trump considers ‘unilateral’ ban on bump stocks — but does he have the power to do so? -
3941 2018-02-27 00:00:34 @DavidMuir 
Why no mention on stocks today?
3942 2018-02-27 00:00:19 Of course but this is at the expense of middle-class jobs!! Now corporations have enough money to buy back stocks and invest in automation. I think we'll see millions of jobs lost over the next 10 years in automation!! #VoteThemAllOut #GOPExtinction
3943 2018-02-27 00:00:02 Most things will prove to be cyclical. forex stocks crypto currency markets
