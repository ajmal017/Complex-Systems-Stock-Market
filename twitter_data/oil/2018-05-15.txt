42 2018-05-15 23:56:26 It doesn’t come shimmery. It just comes as an oil, they probably added shimmer to it

47 2018-05-15 23:55:18 They are the best products for skin care and hair plus there are oil diffusers and oils all developed by KimZolciakBiermann,  Her products are the best.
48 2018-05-15 23:54:52 Have you ever tried making your own oil using a pure distillate as the base ? I find this very effective and easy to control dosage. It might be more effective as most LP’s start w/supercritical co2 oil as a base which to me isn’t as nice as a distillate
49 2018-05-15 23:54:42 Not gonna lie I thought that thunder was the oil tankers in RP exploding
50 2018-05-15 23:54:34 The rising cost of oil should also help in the short term. The greenback will certainly get stronger after the Iran Nuclear Deal debacle.
51 2018-05-15 23:54:09 Most forest in papua was devasted because of palm oil company has conducted big farm by cutting down trees.

57 2018-05-15 23:52:41 Is coconut oil find?
58 2018-05-15 23:52:22 Hahaha the fact you think the only oil field job is working on a rig.... wow. So check this out I watch gauges and pumps all day and make a pretty good living doing so. Her job brings pleasure? Waking up everyday to fist yourself on camera haha try agin bud
59 2018-05-15 23:52:14 For example I would apply the curling cream but not too much because I’ll have to reapply it every other day & it builds up. But also put enough for it to absorb and keep your hair soft. I add DooGro hair oil and the Cantu curl cream together.
60 2018-05-15 23:51:56 Do you do this before or after oil/waxing?
61 2018-05-15 23:51:51 You will need oil after Niburu visit. Transport and reality it has to be contained and plenty turn off taps for in case of breaks. Less flow
62 2018-05-15 23:51:49 Focus! Trump is not selling snake oil. He is selling oil. High oil price? Happy Vladimir. Volatile oilprice? Frontrunning Vladimir. Follow the money.
63 2018-05-15 23:51:26 1.73million barrels Alberta and Canada lose money on. Oil industry in Canada run by Americans - disgusting.

66 2018-05-15 23:51:11 mad.. still didn't get my oil change today 
67 2018-05-15 23:50:52 All the arguments in your link also apply to oil and gas. What we don't produce will be replaced by and imported from countries with lower environmental regulations. The demand will go on and Canada will miss out on great economic revenues that help all Canadians.
68 2018-05-15 23:50:49 Sell it as a beard oil scent, make a million
69 2018-05-15 23:50:28 g this oil pen and coffee hitting the spot. Bass drops have never sounded better. I can’t wait for the fucking weekend, I’m making it my bitch.
70 2018-05-15 23:50:21 i think the one i was checking out is palm oil free and maybe that’s why it was extra moneys
71 2018-05-15 23:50:18 No I can. I’m saying without it I would be in hella pain. I went a day without it cause I’m on vacation and was in the worse pain ever and couldn’t figure out why. Like my pain meds weren’t working. Nothing did until I had an edible and was taking my oil.
72 2018-05-15 23:49:56 Oils going to $100, seeds are sewn so get over it. This is oil, bust then boom. It’ll also be the scapegoat for the next downturn. Economic cycles people, oil will play a small role in the coming downtown, but far less than the overwhelming level of debt the world is swimming in
73 2018-05-15 23:49:31 The Energy Information Administration said Monday that US unconventional #oil production is expected to rise 144,000 b/d in June to 7.178 million b/d. That represents the biggest month-on-month increase since the #EIA began publishing its monthly Drilling Productivity Report.

83 2018-05-15 23:48:44 Tbh we can’t. It’s always going to be a bit dry. I usually use a leave in conditioner, hair oils or Blue Magic Castor Oil. Then braid. My hair holds moisture with these and they are perfect for twist or braid outs.
84 2018-05-15 23:48:40 Yeah it's bad but look on the bright side oil prices are skyrocketing Saudi now has more reserves and may choose to invest in Lebanese businesses.

86 2018-05-15 23:48:29 Kind of like the Iran deal huh LOL but the world don't mind losing Iran. They need America. They've always needed us. Just like the Emirates, who sold the MidEast out for oil. Matter of fact a little thing called the PetroDollar. Who has the gold?

90 2018-05-15 23:47:45 Blocking oil sands when demand keeps growing results in emissions leakage, 2-3x higher emissions & a worse environmental footprint. How is this better for the environment? Your green ideology is hypocritical & results in more damage to the environment. Please educate yourself.

95 2018-05-15 23:47:22 Well what has @JustinTrudeau @CanadianPM done except say he is going to shut down Ft MacMurray stopped Energy North added more requirements for Energy East that was already approved no one in there right mind would invest in Canadian oil Industry

102 2018-05-15 23:46:05 Correct, oil & gas make up the vast majority of state revenue. But at current tax levels, that revenue isn't nearly enough to pay for the budget & since 2015 we've paid for govt thru savings. Oil taxes at a fair level is one piece of the permanent fiscal solution we need.
103 2018-05-15 23:45:59 Commodities v equities still running the analogous pattern  to the previous tech bubble... and stocks not yet flashing 1987 danger v bonds. EMs not full crisis yet either. So copper (but watch the trendline), & oil for another ~10%. Maybe partial gold short against them.

116 2018-05-15 23:44:02 My family has been trying to actively avoid all palm oil for some time now. It’s in so much, I had no idea until I started looking for it. It’s shocking. Here in the UK it is almost impossible to buy confectionary without it.

119 2018-05-15 23:43:22 A lot of them set at the bottom and have to be shaken up because the oil separates

121 2018-05-15 23:43:16 The saddest part is that we knew this would happen. We knew that moving the embassy would destabilize. A destabilized Middle East has long been one of America’s unspoken goals so that we can control the oil.

Wanna know what it is?

129 2018-05-15 23:41:51 That may be because you attempted to promote CBD oil in an autistic support group suggesting it may 'help speech'.
130 2018-05-15 23:41:40 You realize that we're worried about Canadian ports because the oil industry developed the tight-oil production that has allowed the US to be self-sufficient in oil. Before that, we were quite happy to sell it all to the US. Even so, our bitumen is getting to Gulf refineries. /2

142 2018-05-15 23:39:42 But the more common and cost-effective scenario would be CCS on a coal or NG plant piped for EOR. So the CO2 is sequestered for the power plant, not the oil field. Maybe the CO2 would displace steam for EOR? Not sure if CO2 is manufactured for EOR today,
143 2018-05-15 23:39:36 I've been making it at home. Try it some time! Even plain olive oil gives it a really nice flavor.
144 2018-05-15 23:39:26 $NOG oil goes higher because of Iran sanctions, Venezuela prod around 1mil, libya=mess, 
Nigeria= mess, winter, economic strength like $SNDE
145 2018-05-15 23:39:12 That's why I love Oklahoma..It's just one big lease for the Oil and Gas industry, everything (one) else is disposable..

156 2018-05-15 23:38:15 I think they only smell once they're cut open. Not 100% sure. I'm no durian expert. Never even seen one. Maybe they washed off the smelly oil from the outside for shipping. I don't know. Just offering a suggestion.

162 2018-05-15 23:36:32 @JustinTrudeau screwed Alberta on two pipeline proposals and maybe a third if h managed to bungle the Trans Mountain line. To patch things up he throws money at the Green Line. Alberta needs to get its oil out more than they need a transit system.Without the oil, Alberta is toast

177 2018-05-15 23:34:42 Get some liquified coconut oil and swish it around in your mouth for like 5-10 minuets. It’s gross, but it almost instantly gets rid of any type of mouth pain for days.
178 2018-05-15 23:34:36 It’s pretty simple math, right?

Profit = total cashflow after deduction of expenses.

Only the greedy expect profit to remain the same when other conditions (escalating fuel prices, end of cheap oil, fossil fuel divestment, sunset industries) are in play.

Key was always greedy.
179 2018-05-15 23:33:54 Woo hoo! Another customer woke up without back pain today because of our oil!

Welcome to the real deal
200 2018-05-15 23:30:57 Or to put it another way, you could produce carbon-negative oil by pairing renewably powered direct air capture of CO2 with EOR injection (as long as you inject more C than you bring up).
201 2018-05-15 23:30:50 Based on the price inelasticity of oil demand, in the absence of EOR, someone likely would’ve produced 90% as much oil, at a significantly higher price. If EOR sequesters more than 110% of the C contained in the recovered oil, that makes up for the 10%.
202 2018-05-15 23:30:50 Usually agree, even my Calphalon pans do that. Been lucky with this one though. Hot as it'll get, no problems yet! Do use some oil tho.
203 2018-05-15 23:30:49 There is no oil market u in AB u sack of shit.    Who cares where the oil goes as long as it being sold.   Ur allowing foreign oil into Ban and Martinez daily when  can provide this product.   One day the transfer payments will stop

283 2018-05-15 23:20:04 I use CBD oil on my temples and neck. Or you could go to the hospital and get what they call a migraine cocktail and IV fluids. Hopefully it will go away soon! I feel your pain girl.
284 2018-05-15 23:20:03 Our 4th grade scientists are studying absorbency in their current STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) unit. They have conducted many experiments to see which sorbent works best to absorb oil. We love hands-on learning!
285 2018-05-15 23:20:01 doing the simplest jumps in dai is such an ordeal since every surface appears to be covered in oil
286 2018-05-15 23:19:48 I didn’t know CBD oil had anticancer properties...
287 2018-05-15 23:19:36 I love that my uncle is a mechanic, I just got brakes, new wipers, changed my oil, a new horn and he filled my tank

289 2018-05-15 23:19:24 Needs universal hallways. Every ship builds into the next. Failed safety protocols leads to blackballing. Autopilot systems tethered to the satellite node's computers will handle relocation when a "link" abandons their position. Tracking oil through someone else's ship rude.

295 2018-05-15 23:18:07 @gemswinc @WebGrrrrl @sandarwai @MoreThymeBlog @Jade44_4 @deephil11 @salt_life80 @Tuckertown Daisy is back home after her surgery. The second place was Fibro Carcinoma. Will attempt to slow its return with #CBD oil. 
296 2018-05-15 23:17:55 Sunspots are no joke. Ladies use that sunscreen because all of a sudden they might appear as soon as you turn 30!!! Why didn’t anyone warm me when I was a kid?! Why did my mom let me use baby oil 
297 2018-05-15 23:17:37 Jesus hates taxes! Gun control will lead to bestiality! The American Jobs Act is an attack on marriage! Foreign aid to China will lead them to sell us food with cats and dogs in it! Oil pipelines are good for wildlife! Hate crimes legislation leads to necrophilia! ETC!
298 2018-05-15 23:17:37 And now were killing orangutans by using palm oil instead and everything tasted worse.   Things should have stayed as is!

300 2018-05-15 23:17:20 When VZ regime falls, Cuba follow soon after without subsidized oil. Cuba provides intelligence and security apparatus for the Maduro regime. Maduro has no choice but to subsidize Cuba for his own survival.
301 2018-05-15 23:17:16 Oil CO use the military. Private contractors use the military.
302 2018-05-15 23:16:53 You might want to give bullet proof coffee or butter coffee a try in the morning. Of course to get the full benefit, you should also be on ketogenic diet in which around 80% of your daily calorie intake comes from fats. and carbs are reduced to around 20g. Olive oil is great too!

304 2018-05-15 23:16:39 I think that CO2 emissions are the least interesting about the superior technology of electric propulsion. Instant torque, quiet ride, long life, no oil changes, no brake pad changes, full every morning, no variable fuel costs, no waiting (choking) at gas stations...
305 2018-05-15 23:16:37 Have you gotten your three servings of coconut oil today? Bonus points if it's aluminum-free.

310 2018-05-15 23:16:10 @AriMelber the Qatari money could be directly from the 19 and a half percent of the Russian oil interest a purchase from Putin. The money coming into the inaugural could be laundered through the Russians there is a Russian connection to all of this money

314 2018-05-15 23:15:41 Hopefully in time to reap the rewards of $100/bbl oil. It has already been delayed far too long.
315 2018-05-15 23:15:24 イケメンおはよ！
316 2018-05-15 23:15:19 But we are producing more gas and oil now than ever. The prices are being artificially spiked. They'll go back down before too long. I bet withing 3-4 months they will be down in the lower 2's again.
317 2018-05-15 23:15:01 They're shameless hacks. They think it works because people never want to elect Hillary. Let's find out for the next twenty years how blatant lies and pandering to the rich, coal and oil works.
318 2018-05-15 23:14:30 Never put your oil in jars. The TSA will open up your whole bag and see what that shit is haha
319 2018-05-15 23:14:29 Some hypocritically say; 10m people lost jobs under Buhari, did they 4get Buhari inherited a recessed economy @ a time oil slummed to pitiable $38 from PDP days of $100. from which the only dividend they repeatedly finger is al majiri school #wonder4ulworld

322 2018-05-15 23:14:01 Nope, we can get refined oil from Washington. You seem to think that we owe your province something and that our economy needs you. Again, you don't know BC at all.  The Country doesn't revolve around your dinosaur ego. But hey, bring it on and watch what happens.

325 2018-05-15 23:13:39 My biggest disappointment is oil took off before the stocks did, w many up huge the last 1-2 mos, but clearly sentiment was washing out and should have reminded myself absence of selling can be as powerful as buying interest.  Combo of both recently.
326 2018-05-15 23:13:34 the sesame oil is toodamnpotent
327 2018-05-15 23:13:32 I think they are not. There is far too much shady stuff going on with the budget and sudden losses of funding despite increased revenue keeps happening.   Doesn't mean I vehemently oppose every single thing they do.   But as for agendas your the one trying to sell snake oil.
328 2018-05-15 23:13:17 Spent 2 hours in a dealership only for them to tell me that they didn’t do the inspection on my car bc I need new tires so I don’t fail. They just did an oil change.

330 2018-05-15 23:12:47 Gas prices have never been correlated to oil prices as well as they should be. But the point you are making - that there are hidden taxes in the fuel - is demonstrably false. The exact cents per dollar that are taxes is a matter of public record.

333 2018-05-15 23:12:05 Always. You don’t want to trap dirt and extra oils in. Clean your face, use the aloe, go to bed, exfoliate with a charcoal wash in the morning and moisturize your face again for the day. Jojoba or argan oil personally work well on my face for all day moisture. Never lotion

339 2018-05-15 23:11:19 Economics are maybe too much of a challenge, but AB and SK are natural resource economies (aka capital-intensive). Other parts of Canada have labour-intensive economies (more people, less GDP per-capita). Of course, QC could have put oil in the ground - what were they thinking?
340 2018-05-15 23:11:14 Not a christian, but isn't there something in the bible somewhere about taking god's name in vain and god not liking it very much?  I imagine he is more ticked off about that than hemp oil

348 2018-05-15 23:10:24 Thats because they recently started trading oil outside of the petro dollar system.  DUH.  You know what's next.  I live the fact that you source everything.

417 2018-05-15 22:59:23 I love trying to get my oil changed for a long drive to WI tomorrow, only to be told that the tire stem is cracked and needs to be replaced, then finding a place that will fix it at the last possible minute before I have to drive on it for hours tomorrow morning. SO FUN.
418 2018-05-15 22:59:21 @willbarrett_1 TURKEY ASSISTED ISIS! They BOUGHT stolen OIL/ FUNDING THEM! They MURDER KURDS/ who killed ISIS
419 2018-05-15 22:59:19 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
420 2018-05-15 22:59:18 When are we going to start seeing CBD oil commercials? Some people will miss hearing there aren’t grime side-effects.
421 2018-05-15 22:59:14 my mum has suffered with fibromyalgia for years and since she started using cannabis oil she has not had a pain in her back once..can someone explain why this shit isn't legal?
422 2018-05-15 22:59:03 Trump pull out of Iran deal is going to make the prices of crude oil soar. Cost of living to soar with prices of oil. That I can tell you #Butta
423 2018-05-15 22:58:53 Is that like oil and vinegar?  With olives?

425 2018-05-15 22:58:37 I cry all winter about it being cold so I never complain about the heat. I'm all for the 90+ days, the days where the jojoba oil in the car turns into jojoba juice

428 2018-05-15 22:58:17 Never realized how good naan bread is when fried in olive oil and lightly salted with sea salt
429 2018-05-15 22:58:12 In the 90’s today n NYC,  think about the stink!
430 2018-05-15 22:58:11 YES.  Lower corporate taxes or flat taxes just hurt this province.  Government requires a steady operating budget that's not dependent on oil price or the whims of oil companies.
431 2018-05-15 22:58:07 Buhari is a failure. He has brought division instead of unity among the different ethnic groups in the country.Our healthcare sector is in shambles. The only thing covering his failure is that oil price have picked up and Nigeria has more money to spend. We still have secrity too
432 2018-05-15 22:57:53 Taste of cheap oil makes me want to die
433 2018-05-15 22:57:51 only thing virgin is the oil
434 2018-05-15 22:57:30 All beholden to Bibi and Saudi oil
But why blame the admirable Putin
He is in a class above
Your point
435 2018-05-15 22:57:30 Amen!!  Hubby & I both have pain conditions that CBD oil would probably help.  Please ... help us to be able get it in Idaho.  (I’m 68; hubby is 77.   This is NOT for recreational use.)
436 2018-05-15 22:57:27 I'll see what the shock is like. It's had a Maxton rebuilt and there's a rear-hugger fitted, so I entertain hopes it's not completely shagged.
Basic servicing I can do myself, anything beyond oil & filter or chain & sprocket changes goes to my tame mechanic.
437 2018-05-15 22:57:14 But the oil...
438 2018-05-15 22:57:12 Can you overdose on Olbas Oil? Asking for a mate x
439 2018-05-15 22:57:06 Ahh the oil hype train leaves the station.
440 2018-05-15 22:57:04 Thanks Dr. Steve! I’ve been interested with this ever since hearing @pennjillette podcast’s excellent interview with The Amazing Randi, not to use for nefarious purposes, but to be able to recognize and guard against the bs that “psychics” (leeches/snake oil salesmen) use.
441 2018-05-15 22:56:54 Yeah, sexual repression is nothing new. 

If people are good at sex and want to make money on it, well if “because capitalism” is good enough reason to let oil companies destroy the planet, then its got to be a good enough reason to make talent of sexual skills.
442 2018-05-15 22:56:51 Remember that when they push to have pvt cars banned.  Dependence suck!
443 2018-05-15 22:56:49 頑張ってね
444 2018-05-15 22:56:37 20 page Project bid for an Oil major finally done. That took some beer & cashew nuts to complete it. Now to bed & read the report fresh tomorrow morning. Dilemma for employees of oil cos. when I asked what, pump price is going up but our bonuses will be fat ffs have a good night.
445 2018-05-15 22:56:33 Whoever invented Coconut Oil and Sugar scrub...Thank you
446 2018-05-15 22:56:31 Gov of Canada gave money to the auto industry during the great recession of 2008 Apparently you forgot the NDP &Libs demanded more?
Now w/oil in recession Libs &NDP want to shut down the oil sands& offer no money.
You have NO moral high ground here. #abndp #HoC
#ableg #abpoli
447 2018-05-15 22:56:28 Heck ya!! As long as they are cooked in the right kind of oil or ghee. You can have all the potatoes!!! (In n out French fries are technically compliant too but only for emergency situations) 
448 2018-05-15 22:55:49 I love my patio, but I've been getting so many bug bites. Today I remembered I had citronella oil, so I mixed that with some peppermint oil and hopefully my spray will ward off the buggies
449 2018-05-15 22:55:47 Baby oil might increase your risk of a sunburn! I'd stick to body oils like this one, or pure avocado or almond oil which actually have low spf
450 2018-05-15 22:55:43 Oil is a commodity that does not have ready substitutes. A dramatic rise in price is the same as a dramatic increase in a sales tax. It is a net negative for consumers of petroleum products.
451 2018-05-15 22:55:42 i just saw a person say that oil is renewable since oil and water dont mix oh my god
452 2018-05-15 22:55:38 who knows where i can get some THC oil for these slurpees?
453 2018-05-15 22:55:36 I never noticed before but on B99 Kevin has the oil painting of Hilt that Terry did in his office.
454 2018-05-15 22:55:36 What -- no beard oil?
455 2018-05-15 22:55:33 I'm in Oil City, PA and we get those all the time when it rains.  I like the 800 number you're supposed to call when you "see" weather lol.

457 2018-05-15 22:55:11 Most of 1st tranche of NGP was headed to US. But it could take VLCC and SuperMax, and expand Asia component in the long term. No such  class of tanker can be used under TMX. Size restrictions to Burrard.  (Hello Stanley Park). You don’t ship oil to Asia on tanker less than VLCC.
458 2018-05-15 22:55:10 Toyota warranty is still coverin my service stuff but I needed my oil changed asap before I head to vegas.
459 2018-05-15 22:55:01 Doctors like businessmen are not social workers. And the economic and social harm of the legal system is not something Canberra cares about on the national level digging up coal and oil and selling it cheap is.
460 2018-05-15 22:54:51 Not even close.

You have to go out to the oil rigs between Alaska and Siberia for worst of it.
461 2018-05-15 22:54:40 How you going to be flexing a Beamer when it has a check engine light, tire pressure and the oil light on? 
462 2018-05-15 22:54:27 OK Costa Rica friends I have Hemp Oil in....
463 2018-05-15 22:54:22 最近腰痛酷くてお灸してるけど、興味ある！
464 2018-05-15 22:54:04 meanwhile, #akleg still won't ask oil companies to pay their fair share.
465 2018-05-15 22:53:59 Where do you think Murdochs dreams of vast fortune lies? With a subsidiary of Genie energy called Afek Oil.  Drilling the Golan Heights. The just have to steal a little more Syrian land and they will have it. #justsaying
466 2018-05-15 22:53:50 How many times am I going to use skin care products with almond oil until I REMEMBER THAT I AM ALLERGIC TO ALMOND OIL
467 2018-05-15 22:53:40 You get a Honda. They don’t change the oil of Bentley’s at Walmart . We gotta get you something you can afford
468 2018-05-15 22:53:35 Did y’all see the Man City title parade ... I guess the oil money can’t buy fans!! 
469 2018-05-15 22:53:28 ら〜油きゅんおはよ！
470 2018-05-15 22:53:28 There’s definitely a spirit around that knows when I need to relax.... I went downstairs to finish my laundry and when I came back up my oil diffuser was on...
471 2018-05-15 22:53:19 Id sell all the oil in Alberta for one Canadian to rise from poverty. But yea but the rich get richer via systemic economic policies and subsequent political decrees.
472 2018-05-15 22:53:08 Wow I took my car to Lexus of Bellevue to get a $90 oil change and they scratched my car 
473 2018-05-15 22:52:55 Canny get a wink eh sleep cause I'm currently melting into a puddle of sherp oil
474 2018-05-15 22:52:49 I chopped and fried some garlic and chilli flakes and added the oil to the sauce. Thought I'd put far too much chilli in but I think I got it perfect.
475 2018-05-15 22:52:40 I think it is foolish for all you people try to predict the Same Market over and over since most of them are in No Man Land.  Why don't you use your skill pick something more trend friendly.  Such as TSE index or Oil.  I think if I pull your past record, you are 50/50 or 60/40
476 2018-05-15 22:52:19 LRT was actually my fav script to work on after the coffee/oil one...I think i`m getting better at making them sound more fun and natural hehe
477 2018-05-15 22:51:52 ね！めっちゃいい！
478 2018-05-15 22:51:45 Your tax law will increase taxes on most of us. More money to military contractors. Anti-consumer, pro-donor economic policies. Putting the oil industry over fighting climate change. Putting big banks over the rest of us. A VA in disarray. Never mind the corruption. No thanks.
479 2018-05-15 22:51:29 It's fine, I do it too. Just make sure it's not everyday. Applying that much oil in our beard is not healthy. Also I make a mix with castor oil and tea tree

481 2018-05-15 22:51:04 yesterday i ate a CBD oil honeystick from the co-op ($1.49) and i didnt rly feel much, maybe sleepy, today i ate a hard-boiled egg from coffeeshop (also $1.49) and afterwards felt the way people describe CBD effects. idk u tell me
482 2018-05-15 22:51:04 Too. Fuckin. True. I need to do a count on those when I get home. I think the dog has more lotions and shit then I do.    BUT CHRIS, the coco butter with Shea oil is only good for right hands, the left hand needs plant balm with aloe!
483 2018-05-15 22:50:57 How about you stop buying the oil first?  And while you're at it, maybe stop being the busiest port in North America for coal?
484 2018-05-15 22:50:36 Discuss. Are veggies still veggies even marinated in honey oil and vinegars and other things and cooked twice
485 2018-05-15 22:50:34 my mans, up the ante.  oil diffusers.  some lavender really sets the mood.

489 2018-05-15 22:50:02 Shortly there after Qatar was put on quarantine by 4 other middle eastern oil producer countries for funding terrorists How convenient
490 2018-05-15 22:49:41 @kevinonxm I was just flipping through the engine manual for my 2018 Freightliner Cascadia dd15. And it actually says that oil sampling is recommended to determine oil changes. Good thing I bought a 5-pack oil sampler from your website
491 2018-05-15 22:49:37 Only thing that helps me is avoiding trigger foods - all animal products, wheat, oil, processed food - its a lot  but its a personal thing, I wouldn't recommend the LOWFODMAP diet unless you've exhausted all avenues bc you could be cutting out foods that don't affect u at all..
492 2018-05-15 22:49:27 strange: according to press, #Venezuela spends millions of dollars it doesn't have to import oil from abroad to gift to #Cuba. meanwhile #Ecuador spends millions of dollars it doesn't have to protect Assange in London and run a spy operation on his behalf. what am I missing here?
493 2018-05-15 22:49:11 オイルはギトギトというイメージを拭い去ろうか。時にはサラサラし、時にはギトギト。オイルはいつだって君のそばにいるのさ。
494 2018-05-15 22:49:08 Lol it’s all good, I usually sear it on each side for 3 minutes each with olive oil then oven at 400 for bout 25 minutes
495 2018-05-15 22:48:52 It depends so much on each individual cis teen/men can grow it super fast or not at all
Also you can like help itngrow better with oil and stuff but from what I know beard is one of the slowest thing when it comes to HRT
496 2018-05-15 22:48:51 Alberta must diversify for the future generation whether they like it or not. Oil will go the way of the phone booth or mailman before you know it.
497 2018-05-15 22:48:43 I’m not worried about the effects of $100 oil on the US economy. 

The Tax Breaks can handle $100 oil.

I’m worried about the Fed tightening in response to $100 oil.

Net capital outflow effect.
498 2018-05-15 22:48:19 Please help me tell them...

When these guys (current govt) came with the excuse of crude oil prices, I knew immediately that they were clueless!
499 2018-05-15 22:48:15 Nobody is holding a gun to the heads of these ppl to come here to work or stay here but oh wait you came here because you make more $$ here than the province you’re from oh ok. Ppl like this guy bash AB yet the province they’re from get most of their $$ from AB oil

504 2018-05-15 22:47:01 I use hydrogen peroxide, water and essential oil, with or without baking soda. Also, lavender and tea tree oil kill almost everything. Thanks for sharing the article.
505 2018-05-15 22:46:59 If you support justin with taxpayer money it will be for all his pleasure. So why not oil sands? You want to keep driving? Or support trudeau with his holidays?
506 2018-05-15 22:46:41 And, PS, TMX oil doesn’t go to Asia.
507 2018-05-15 22:46:40 Это я
508 2018-05-15 22:46:38 there is growing concern about the water pollution from oil spill
509 2018-05-15 22:46:34 The reality was that Ogbe-Wonder had more power & funds - oil boom+military governor. He also spent EIGHT YEARS as helmsman..1967-75 while Alli was there for only FOUR YEARS. The 1983 elections were unfortunate..a choice btwn GOOD and GOOD. Excellent leaders both. Proud of them
510 2018-05-15 22:46:25 There are Limits to Growth, that we seem to be pushing against (e.g. Overshoot, peak oil/resources, 6th Great Extinction) that nearly No one is aware of (mt)

513 2018-05-15 22:45:49 Please elaborate on how TMX gets oil to Asia?
514 2018-05-15 22:45:46 e be like engine oil
515 2018-05-15 22:45:26 They've had their own oil bourse for years,and China just opened it's own yuan-based oil trading entity a few months ago. It's definitely an act that gets you on the Naughty List,but I think we have Israeli,GOP,and War Machine interests at play here as well.
516 2018-05-15 22:45:19 Have you tried clove oil at all?

534 2018-05-15 22:43:32 Statistics from NBS indicates that the inflation rate has being reducing within the last one year, so the recent rise in the price of crude oil will increase revenue & further help  to boost the economy, @cchukudebelu , be more constructive in criticism

540 2018-05-15 22:42:43 #edu2018 It feels as though the oil and gas industry has done a very poor job of educating the general public on the step change improvements that have been made in cleaning up our industry on many levels. What is the barrier to better education.

550 2018-05-15 22:40:50 Israel isn't denying them access to food, water and medication, it's supplying them itself! Plus petrol, oil, merchandise. You gullibly lap up and parrot this Hamas and BDS propaganda. Yesterday the rioters destroyed the Karni crossing and oil pipeline to force more suffering!
551 2018-05-15 22:40:49 US oil production is the reason we won't get  100 dollar oil this time around. 11 million+ bpd here we come.
552 2018-05-15 22:40:45 Peter Tertzakian calls out @richardbranson at #EDU2018 for using ' tar sands' to refer to the oil sands - saying it is an  example of negative branding and goes on to highlight important advances in the oil sands that have taken place and will continue to take place.

560 2018-05-15 22:39:47 its simple, you just drain it change the filter and pour new oil in, i think the guy was just waiting for the old oil to drain
561 2018-05-15 22:39:47 Really? Can you name a few, together with the vaccine they’re contained in?

(This is going to be the old, dumb peanut oil in vaccines meme, right?)
562 2018-05-15 22:39:37 So I slept in mums apartment and she has to chase me away,what a sweet dream this woman cost me,n its not yet 12
563 2018-05-15 22:39:36 Baby oil tastes fucking horrible
564 2018-05-15 22:39:32 I put coconut oil in leftover white rice and 
565 2018-05-15 22:39:31 Yes I did use coconut oil cooking spray as my tanning lotion today 
566 2018-05-15 22:39:30 I thought you support energy workers. Aren't installers of solar panels energy workers? Once a solar panel is there, the sun shines down free energy. Even fossil fuels like coal & oil are merely ANCIENT SOLAR ENERGY. Why wait millions of years to harness it? It's shining down now
567 2018-05-15 22:39:25 Hahaha.  Well, 'truth' always 3 layers deeper than we know.  i.e.: if he talks, the Russian mob/oligarchs kill him?  Iran treaty break: it benefits 1) Russia 2) Rosneft Oil (profits increase) 4) 19.5% Rosneft bribe to Trump suddenly worth more... so... Putin told him to ...?
568 2018-05-15 22:39:21 I support America which is why I don’t support Trump. You have been duped by a demagogue who is nothing more than a two bit snake oil salesman. He sold you a bill of goods about draining the swamp when the fact is that he is the swamp. Some of us have been awake from the start.
569 2018-05-15 22:39:06 But your president say the best way to spend our oil revenue is to fund free SHS.
570 2018-05-15 22:39:04 We struck gold at the Napa Valley Olive Oil Competition!  #EVOO, #oliveoil, #foodie
571 2018-05-15 22:39:02 So sorry,  but German potato salad is the best.  Oil, vinegar, bacon.....  mmmm.
572 2018-05-15 22:38:55 Vast reserves of oil , it’s almost impossible to mess the economy up . And yet
573 2018-05-15 22:38:55 @facebook Good job Facebook. I join a few years ago only to get an Item in a game. Kind of knew this would happen. Now your becoming more accountable, lets hope the other big Corporate Giants, like Pharmaceuticals, Oil, Electronic Producer, Food Producers, etc. can do the same.
574 2018-05-15 22:38:48 They said the fall in naira as against dollar was as a result of the fall in crude oil price.... Now crude is up by 50% as against the 40 dollars bench mark of 2016. Naira still remain at 350 per dollar as against the 180 naira per dollar of 2016. Make naira strong again FG
575 2018-05-15 22:38:47 Okay, but I'm pretty sure you didnt grow up wanting to work on an oil rig. Its just a job just like being a cam girl is a job. At least hers brings pleasure for some. Your just helping some rich guy fuck the world up more while risking your life. I think she got rhe better deal.
576 2018-05-15 22:38:43 I have to agree-the tax breaks help the middle class for a while, but corporations (and oil companies) see people w/more disposable income and they, of course, raise prices-you have to wonder if it was a big help or just a little...
577 2018-05-15 22:38:38 a coward: u cant just put hot chili oil on everything
me, inhaling 老干妈: u cant just say that
578 2018-05-15 22:38:28 All you people super excited for oil to hit $100..have not factored in the the economic havoc this would wreak right now ..especially in light of a stronger USD ..
579 2018-05-15 22:38:23 When they finish feasting on oil,  they will feast on you. They have nothing to hold on except the resources of other people.
580 2018-05-15 22:38:22 My oil cartridge has supreme on it...I don’t really know why.
581 2018-05-15 22:38:14 I feel like a real adult today. I paid for my dental copay, got an oil change, new filters and wipers!
582 2018-05-15 22:37:52 and the reason i carry multiple 30rd magazines
583 2018-05-15 22:37:20 Been taking fish oil for bout a month or 2 & I’ve been seeing some changes
584 2018-05-15 22:37:04 oh my god lrt???? ARE U TELLING ME THATS NOT AN OIL PAINTING
585 2018-05-15 22:37:03 My friend sent a pic of my dog off to a company that turned the pic into what looks like an oil painting. This picture should be enlarged and framed! So cute!
586 2018-05-15 22:36:54 Boycott food and other products containing palm oil.  If we all do this, the $ message might make a difference!
587 2018-05-15 22:36:49 Hoy es Odebrecht, antes fue Standard Oil, General Dynamics, Schlumberger, Bell Helicopter, etc. No me explico cómo es que en pleno siglo XXI las campañas políticas siguen siendo financiadas por el sector privado.
588 2018-05-15 22:36:26 Both contain palm oil, so neither. Contributing to dead gingers. Not Harry! Orangutans. #savetheorangutans
589 2018-05-15 22:36:24 I'm honestly curious... are you aware of the Rosneft deal at all, or its potential relationship to al-Rumaihi attending the Trump tower meeting?  Are you aware of the implications of Iranian sanctions on global oil prices and who stands to profit directly from those sanctions?
590 2018-05-15 22:36:23 Oil
591 2018-05-15 22:36:12 Do you think we need some #pipeline help? Brent #crude trading at close to an $8 premium over WTI. #oil
592 2018-05-15 22:36:06 Help!
I've been cleaning my glasses with shampoo thinking it was cutting through the oil from day to day wear. Well, I have what I guess are shampoo deposits. How do I get this build up, off. Oh my gosh.. I put this stuff on my hair.

How should I remove the residue? (Plastic)
593 2018-05-15 22:36:04 I would like to respectfully asked to be BLOCKED/UN FOLLOWED/NAGGED.

To each his own and I find the HARPING on an insignificant issue MIND NUMBING!

What is in any of this SHIT??? What works 4me might make I SICK! DO you need OIL to aid the UPTAKE,  who fucking knows?
594 2018-05-15 22:35:57 امين يارب العالمين
595 2018-05-15 22:35:51 Waiting to get an oil change and this lady just staring in my damn face  trying not to be that black girl right now lbs
596 2018-05-15 22:35:34 They said the fall in naira as against dollar was as a result of the fall in crude oil price.... Now crude is up by 50% as against the 40 dollars bench mark of 2016. Naira still remain at 350 per dollar as against the 180 naira per dollar of 2016. Make naira strong again FG
597 2018-05-15 22:35:12 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
598 2018-05-15 22:35:12 This vid is pretty awesome. My President!
599 2018-05-15 22:35:01 Joining @JoeSquawk, @MelissaLeeCNBC and @andrewrsorkin on @SquawkCNBC tomorrow to discuss the markets, oil and treasury yields. Tune into @CNBC at 7am ET to watch live.
600 2018-05-15 22:34:59 Cannabis fucking oil!
601 2018-05-15 22:34:48 Oil promises to mix with water.
602 2018-05-15 22:34:41 Oil companies new back in the 70s climate change was man made.  They fought against it because it hurt their bottom line.
603 2018-05-15 22:34:39 We don't need Iranian oil. Trump will do what he just did to The Palestinian States. Give our political system time to adjust. We know to register to vote, and vote. Trump Republicans just lost a big deal and they spent the day playing golf and taking selfies. Goodbye, Earl...
604 2018-05-15 22:34:27 Dip that garlic in some ghost pepper oil first!
605 2018-05-15 22:34:26 My gut feeling tells me: from now on, unless there is a swift re-allocation capital from tech monsters and other bubble parasitic economies to E&P economy, a surprising oil crisis like the 70s, is coming with vengeance to shock the hell out of our fragile global economy.
606 2018-05-15 22:34:24 You are such a joke And we are not stupid. I received no raise, no bonus, and no tax break increases. Just higher, gas, oil, and healthcare.
607 2018-05-15 22:34:14 That isn't 'customs controls' or RoO issues, you just can't check them at the border, to take a silly example are you expecting Border  Force officers to know the difference between Moroccan & Spanish olive oil?
608 2018-05-15 22:34:08 Please look into CBD oil for relief of post partum depression. That will be a very interesting show for sure. 
609 2018-05-15 22:34:02 Free oil changes are the best oil changes 
610 2018-05-15 22:33:50 But renewables people don't see themselves on the side of fossil fuels. They see fossil and nuclear on the same team. It just happens that it works in the favor of oil + gas.
611 2018-05-15 22:33:42 I think I am lacking cultural points of reference. Am I right in thinking that you are trying to rub oil into an injured muscle, and the stuff is getting onto your hands and it is hurting?
612 2018-05-15 22:33:03 yo should i attempt this $60 cbd oil for mental health and joint pain ? bc i’ve tried no oils for anything and uh ! idk man !
613 2018-05-15 22:33:01 Boy-O-Boy those old timers had the expression correct -- SNAKE OIL SALESMEN!!  Yes indeeded, fits Trumpski to a perfect 'T' --- he's taking us into a disastrous war from which we may never recover.  It will take a great toll on this country.
614 2018-05-15 22:32:54 Nothing is more inflationary than rising #OIL prices.  Gas prices are 72% determined by oil.
615 2018-05-15 22:32:54 "Let's get ready to rumble." A very very sassy Lynn Helms from N. Dakota is pretty confident that Bakken production will surpass 1.23 mil b/d record in June despite March drop that was reported today. #oil #bakken
616 2018-05-15 22:32:48 A hotbed of islamist activity in Canada.  3 guys involved in blowing up oil installations inLibya.
617 2018-05-15 22:32:33 I remember some whiny liberal in the early 2000s comparing TX to Saudi Arabia: hot, full of oil, run by religious conservatives, always executing people. TX should push that idea to keep out the vermin fleeing CA.
618 2018-05-15 22:32:22 i went to midas but @ProletariatPep is gonna teach me how to change my own oil next time lol
619 2018-05-15 22:32:17 Olive oil mayo, sorry my triglycerides.
620 2018-05-15 22:32:15 Our super easy and go to is cod loins with Italian breadcrumbs and olive oil mixed into a thick paste on top of the fish. Don't have time and temp but can check if you're interested. Must be thick fish because the Italian seasoning overpowers thin filets.
621 2018-05-15 22:32:12 I need to put some coconut oil on my fucked up attitude

626 2018-05-15 22:31:40 @findlocalgarage my “dipstick” is perfect for checking my oil levels; if I ask him nicely he also tops up my washer fluid!
627 2018-05-15 22:31:36 Wasn’t it you who said Russia needs $100/barrel oil to get in the black?
628 2018-05-15 22:31:13 Me vs the popping oil
629 2018-05-15 22:31:03 Burning the midnight oil
630 2018-05-15 22:31:01 @realDonaldTrump  so if we as a country export more oil than we import,,, why is fuel soaring and why do we as a government bow down to the oil rich countries when we have more or just as much?
631 2018-05-15 22:30:51 We would add: Rinsing fat, oil and grease down the kitchen sink to this list as well. Clogs your pipes, causes major damage to the city sewer system and contaminates waterways. #homeowners #FOGSafe #LoveMyFOGSafe #cooking #homechef
632 2018-05-15 22:30:46 Mix 2 tablespoons Squid  with 8 oz carne asada. Blend with Olive Oil. Freeze for 9 hours. Serve with love.
633 2018-05-15 22:30:36 #This was a deal kept to Putin , buy his oil and Saudis at higher cost . Enjoy that new gas guzzler
634 2018-05-15 22:30:34 I would be careful with that. Anything oil based like that, adding a highlight to it can get you sunburned.

638 2018-05-15 22:29:58 I wash 2 times daily with African Black Soap 
then I apply tea tree oil all over & benzoyl peroxide on spots 

I also use st.ives apricot scrub every other night 

It has worked MIRACLES on my skin 
639 2018-05-15 22:29:49 About to go live on @Twitch come on through but please... no baby oil
640 2018-05-15 22:29:40 Ah yes...they must have seen that lost episode where the tardis lands in an oil slick after Bessy blew a sump gasket. I remember it well. (Not)  #DrWhoandtheOilyMess
641 2018-05-15 22:29:29 Hey do any of you know someone in israel who makes Rick Simpson Oil? A family friend has cancer and has been using it but has run out
642 2018-05-15 22:29:22 Tea tree oil helps. I place q-tips soaked in it on windows sills and drop a few drops around the doors and where the pipes some in.
643 2018-05-15 22:29:17 Yum! Add in some oil and balsamic vinegar and you've got my perfect snack!

645 2018-05-15 22:28:34 Obama murdered over a million Muslims Arabs over his eight years in office. Oil rich Saudis are responsible for Palestineans' poverty, not Israel.
646 2018-05-15 22:28:28 Because he's disappeared....................................

Numerous reports have drawn links between Ye's disappearance and U.S. bribery charges against former Hong Kong home affairs secretary Patrick Ho Chi-ping in a case involving African oil rights.
647 2018-05-15 22:28:18 It took me reading all the way down to your comment to find *anyone* to say the truth. China wants the US 100% OUT of the peninsula. Russia wants a formal trilateral w/ NK & China. Trump is over a barrel now: ego, trade wars, personal biz deals, oil, Military Industrial Complex.

651 2018-05-15 22:27:52 U know how much fuckin oil i have put in this bitch on the past two days??????? Too damn much and it dries up within the hour im bout to mcfreakin lose it
652 2018-05-15 22:27:49 If the EU ends subsidies for palm-oil biodiesel, while keeping its overall biofuel targets, cars will be fuelled with soybean or rapeseed oil instead… and that’s much more destructive for the environment (palm is several times more efficient by surface unit).

656 2018-05-15 22:27:26 I think a lot of people will go to Trump’s. At least one will stick a stake in his heart to make sure he does not return from the dead. There will be no cremation with ashes scattered at sea for fear of an oil slick.

659 2018-05-15 22:26:49  Disrespectful. 
90% of my inquiring texts start like, “Hi” and “Avail?” “Price?” Is that how you talk to your mechanic, plumber or doctor’s office? Eg: “Carburator?” “Oil, how much?”, “Pipes?”, “When fix sink?” “Cough,” “Dr?” Flu?” (Get my drift? Lol.)

672 2018-05-15 22:24:07 I spent 22 hours planting 200 lbs of garlic cloves on my weekend last.  Approx 5600 cloves over 66 x 80' rows in the hot sun, no shade.  On my way home after dark I hit 3 deer with my vehicle that's so new I still haven't done it's first oil change.  Do I win?
673 2018-05-15 22:23:48 My dad brought my car back to me today with a full tank of gas and he got me an oil change 
674 2018-05-15 22:23:33 @NYGovCuomo is an immigrant, he's black, he's gay, he's in Israel, he's in Puerto Rico, he's fundraising from oil companies, he's Googling "what do progressives care about," all at once because he's a NEW YORKER!!
675 2018-05-15 22:23:30 In my experience it’s like trying to mix oil and water! Doesn’t mix. 
676 2018-05-15 22:23:23 Listening to @AmyMcGrathKY talk about climate change, analogizing to Navy’s transition from sail to coal to oil to (partially) nuclear 
677 2018-05-15 22:23:17 Go protest some other oil producer like say... USA, Iran, Saudi ... go to Strait of Hormuz ... be brave ... why just Canada?
678 2018-05-15 22:23:13 I made a homemade skin mask thing bc I had all the ingredients (oatmeal, honey, lemon juice, tea tree oil). I have to leave it on for 20 minutes. It looks like a baby threw up on me. This is great.
679 2018-05-15 22:23:12 Need to oil Mother soon. Get all the hard-to-reach places.
680 2018-05-15 22:23:02 This government's economic policies have been exposed as inflation keeps rising.  Their excuse used to be 'falling oil prices',  now the oil price has risen and things are even getting worse.  Clueless government.
681 2018-05-15 22:22:56 They said the fall in naira as against dollar was as a result of the fall in crude oil price.... Now crude is up by 50% as against the 40 dollars bench mark of 2016.

685 2018-05-15 22:22:22 Dorothy Morris, Discovery Place, Devon is only 1 if 2 living women that where there when the oil came in.  You should chat.  She is with it!  Great stories from that day.  Tweet me if you want to meet up.  I'm her stylist.
686 2018-05-15 22:22:21 If and when Iranians did use tactical nukes on Israel, these ppl are going to be spared? In an all out war they will escape somehow?
687 2018-05-15 22:22:20 Just like the Nazis, these leaders of ours shooting palm oil will be OK, if the misdeeds they commit are hidden from the general population. Thus they keep the general population in a carefully organized darkness (here about forcing taxpayers to pay for biofuels, including palm)!

691 2018-05-15 22:21:54 Day 2 ok #ketogenic diet.  My main difficulty is finding ways to get fat without the protein. I'm already taking mct oil, coconut oil, grass fed butter, avocado and avocado oil, but still short on fats.  No complaints though. Liking it!

693 2018-05-15 22:21:38 My sister dabbed peppermint oil on my temples before yoga and now I have a massive headache. So I don’t ever again want to hear anyone tell me how peppermint oil is a migraine cure. 
694 2018-05-15 22:21:28 Wonder is China withdrawing from Rosneft deal is related to this admission? C:\Users\owner\Documents\Trump Intelligence Allegations_files\China Bows Out of Russian Oil Deal.htm
695 2018-05-15 22:21:26 No, you have to make apples to apples comparisons. UAE is 20% homogenous citizens and 80% diverse foreign SERVANTS. It is rich in oil. Neither Singapore or Gaza have those “utopia-like” conditions. No diversity of citizenry.
696 2018-05-15 22:21:20 Oil and dirt all over my clothes 
697 2018-05-15 22:21:16 thinking of shaving every hair off my body and covering myself in olive oil, then sliding home from work this evening
698 2018-05-15 22:21:08 Actually coal and oil was more profitable before climate change.  Since then there been tougher regulations on coal and oil.
699 2018-05-15 22:21:05 @OgbeniDipo for the boys dem wey get better oil for head!!
700 2018-05-15 22:21:03 That only last until the Permian basin gets enough pipeline to supply the oil then it is over.
701 2018-05-15 22:20:56 We are 180 million in population, with more than 500 languages and culture. United in diversity, depending on single source of income since 70s. Oil killed the country's main source of income. There was recklessness of the country's income from the oil at it ovation 4 16yrs. So ?
702 2018-05-15 22:20:30 Akins really tried it. I’m not about to pay a million dollars for lavender oil. Imma just die

707 2018-05-15 22:19:38 I believe the planned development on the former Imperial Oil lands needs to be hugely revised. Yesterday it took me 22 minutes to drive from Richard's Memorial to Hurontario during morning rush hour. Adding the thousands of people to that spot will create even more havoc.
708 2018-05-15 22:19:30 @stainswickfarm I love your oil! Usually I get 5 litres and fill my glass bottle from it. Any chance I can call in at the farm to get my current (and emptied today) 5 litre plastic container refilled, to reduce plastic waste?
709 2018-05-15 22:19:28 Hey I’m from S.C.  We are like Texas without the hats, oil, big population, or PR. Like, who was in charge at the Alamo? SC guy. No PR. We do have more of one thing: humidity.

721 2018-05-15 22:17:11 Denis says oil pipelines pollute; whilst Qubecers pump their untreated sewage into Seaway.  Don't even try to argue it. You'll look stupid.

726 2018-05-15 22:16:50 its not so simple definitely. In terms of oil prices probably Iran and Saudi Arabia were more close to each other than to US as its shale producers directly go against main stream oil production. Follow @anasalhajji to get a dip into this complex world
727 2018-05-15 22:16:35 FG said part of the reason for the fall in naira as against dollar was as a result of the fall in crude oil price.... Now crude is up by 50% as against the 40 dollars bench mark of 2016. Naira still remain at 350 per dollar as against the 180 naira per dollar of 2016. TheirIsGod
728 2018-05-15 22:16:30 
729 2018-05-15 22:16:28 So all the Bonanzo from taxes on Oil is shrinking. Might even end next year? Impact on fiscal deficit and current a/c deficit will be significant.
730 2018-05-15 22:16:19 
731 2018-05-15 22:16:17 You choose to deny Big Pharma's priority bottom-line. Their goal is not to put themselves out of business any more than Big Oil. Eugene Mallove is no longer alive either...
732 2018-05-15 22:16:15 Mixing palm oil to “green” fuels crazily triples carbon emissions… instead of doing what it was advertised to be doing, reducing said emissions. And it's subsidised by the European Union: taxpayers are legally forced to destroy rainforests, & accelerate the climate catastrophe!
733 2018-05-15 22:16:09 Mau almond oil nya....
734 2018-05-15 22:16:07 My greatest shame is that I never use it and have never used it. "Season it with olive oil to prepare for everyday use" is ON my to-do list. Maybe this weekend!
735 2018-05-15 22:15:53 Are you patting dry then rubbing olive oil onto the affected skin? I do that when it’s bad. I also use Aveeno because the base ingredient is the Aveno oat species.

Coconut oil has become extremely popular due to clever marketing which claims it is a panacea, curing everything from athlete's foot to stomach problems.

744 2018-05-15 22:14:43 The Ethiopian's natural right would be to move to Anchorage and contribute to that community, which would then entitle him to an equal share of those urban rents. But it's global activity that drives commodity rents like oil and gas, so he should always get a share.

756 2018-05-15 22:12:58 And Hamas to use the opportunity to spur public outrage. This is Trump's plan to: 1)raise oil prices (short term), 2) provoke Israeli settlement expansion, 3)inspire more terrorist attacks globally, 4) validate US military response to defend Israel.
757 2018-05-15 22:12:57 @WhySharksMatter I recently learned that one of the main ingredients in preperation H is shark liver oil

what's up with that
758 2018-05-15 22:12:49 Your own article at the end end up disputing those scientists claims.  And who funded them?  Oil companies...?
759 2018-05-15 22:12:47 Then all those Hate messages about blaming Bush for oil/gas prices from 1/20/2001 to 1/18/2009 were Not HIS Fault, right? Isn’t your hypocrisy fun?
760 2018-05-15 22:12:32 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.

764 2018-05-15 22:11:37 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
765 2018-05-15 22:11:36 But Israel left Gaza almost more than 10 years ago. They could build something great out of gaza. And they got money from the U.S. but no, they used it for tunnels and terror. And not their own people.
766 2018-05-15 22:11:33 tell ya what, it’s pretty difficult to be a young business lady speaking as a technical expert for 3 hours about oil to a group of dudes, but here I am, killing it.
767 2018-05-15 22:11:27 Oh there's.... so many things.  Of course the slaughter of the natives, slavery, Jim Crowe and the like, the fact that we turned a blind eye to the Holocaust until directly attacked, murdering millions to manipulate oil prices..... *sigh*.

772 2018-05-15 22:11:14 Hey is that its actually Castor oil, because he turned his dog into a ditch.
773 2018-05-15 22:11:12 So far the liberals have accomplished nothing related to pipelines except drive the oil companies out. Buts that’s exactly what your leader Gerald Butts and his puppet Trudeau wanted.
774 2018-05-15 22:10:58 Real problem with palm oil isn’t in your kitchen or bathroom. In Europe, it is in your car. Or, more precisely, its tank.

Half of all the palm oil imported by the European Union is turned into “biodiesel” and blended into conventional fuel to power cars and trucks
775 2018-05-15 22:10:50 Walk in for an oil change... all of a sudden 10 filters need changed.

780 2018-05-15 22:10:32 I prefer a hybrid, where rent is returned equally to individuals within communities that create the rents. In other words, a farmer in Ethiopia might have an equal claim to oil rents in Alaska, but he would not have an equal claim to urban ground rents in the city of Anchorage
781 2018-05-15 22:10:28 Europe will soon choose to buy oil in Euros or Petroyuan and get rid of US dollar reserves, causing inflation in the US

788 2018-05-15 22:09:39 The reason oil is ridiculously high is that Congress approved oil exports for the first time since the mid 70’s.  Inventory numbers are being manipulate by oil companies.

800 2018-05-15 22:08:26 Trump just cares about his own pockets and financial partners, blinding Republicans with division while he does it. How is America today investing more into privatized concentration camps, prisons, walls and drilling oil rather than securing a progressive future for us all.
801 2018-05-15 22:08:18 I covered this in a short video last week. A higher oil price acts as a tax and also like an interest rate increase on consumers and the economy
802 2018-05-15 22:08:09 if you seasoned it properly it wouldn't ?? this picture stresses me out. give me olive oil and half an hour with it pls

822 2018-05-15 22:05:28 Yup, almost happened to me. Forget to change the oil, oil burns off, engine overheats.
823 2018-05-15 22:05:21 Oil prices will go up and that's what we would like.  But I think Washington is not interesting to see a rise in the oil prices, at least for the moment.

837 2018-05-15 22:02:51 Smogg is a classic snake oil salesmen. To use one of his own favourite terms, an utterly “cretinous” individual.
838 2018-05-15 22:02:48 how do ppl who paint with oil not wanna kms
839 2018-05-15 22:02:41 According to the Steele dossier, Trump was promised was 19% of Rosneft for his end of the bargain. In January 2017, Reuters reported that 19.5% of the Russian oil company was sold through a series of shell companies to hide its ownership. I have a feeling we found the owner....

847 2018-05-15 22:02:09 The man changing my oil made a snarky comment about my BW sticker and proceeded to tell me he went to Mount.... like sir u work at a VALVOLINE how u gonna play urself like that
848 2018-05-15 22:01:41 I feel your pain Jungle brother. I work 21 days straight, 12 hours a day on an oil rig...ready to chill at home permanently now haha. Loved your last YouTube vid by the way!
849 2018-05-15 22:01:32 Oil contract awards, GMB hasn't disappointed me.
For those who know, It's been mentioned here for a long while, follow the oil monies.

GMB is a crook, & HE WILL PAY someday.
850 2018-05-15 22:01:25 Nope. They're sitting on our oil. So they must be regime changed.

so don’t ask me nothing lol
856 2018-05-15 22:00:39 IMHO this, like all things Trump and Putin, is about money. Destabilizing the oil producing countries will help Putin and Russian Oligarchs more than lifting sanctions. Trump is not bumbling his way into this result. It is absolutely his goal. Wthout a shadow of a doubt.
857 2018-05-15 22:00:36 Not that I can tell. It's been $3 and higher since before Derby in Shepherdsville. And every gas station is always crowded. People will always pay, and the oil folks know this.

859 2018-05-15 22:00:30 Biggest contender I had on the '89 Mitsu I had was it had a slow burn on oil.  Nothing terrifying but usually about a quart of oil or so every 3000 miles.  Much of that was the engine and the rings which liked to color my exhaust blue for a bit at startup.
860 2018-05-15 22:00:24 I had my mom take my car and go get a oil change for me because I had no time to do it this week and I called her to see where she’s at and she getting all my tires changed

863 2018-05-15 22:00:11 You can't be surprised at this point. 

Anyone who knows how good Keto is knows that it could kill the Grain, Vegetable oil and refined sugar industries.

The amount of money doctors get from these groups ensures that the High Fat/No sugar diet will be a footnote, sadly.

866 2018-05-15 21:59:25 Thank you!! It’s because of @BijouxsBasket face wash honestly!! That and almond oil ;)
867 2018-05-15 21:59:25 My oil’s are more concentrated than half the niggas out here. 
868 2018-05-15 21:59:18 A couple oil tycoon Saudi's and the Rothschild family are said to be worth a few trillion.
869 2018-05-15 21:59:09 What winning?  Tax reform is failing, job growth slowing, north Korea back to it's old ways.  Embassy can't be used.  Poll numbers flat.  Oil higher.
870 2018-05-15 21:59:07 Ya’ll heard about that egg plant oil spritzer and the limited edition lemon scented new born baby tears... Those really helped my skin glow.
871 2018-05-15 21:59:04 so, if a fan, a rotating tabletop one has a significant squeak, is there a specific part one should oil? is that a stupid question?? am i going to take it all apart and not know what to do??
872 2018-05-15 21:59:04 Oh yeah, oil over acrylic works fine as long as it's dry.

877 2018-05-15 21:58:11 Lol daily wire calling climate change  hoax.

Where is the scientific articles supporting daily wire claims.

You mean studies that was funded by oil companies that are discredited?
878 2018-05-15 21:58:04 I was thinking pencil lead but then go over THAT with a line of acrylic and then erase the lead when the acrylic dries and THEN oil paint on top?! ... But I dunno if it'd work
879 2018-05-15 21:57:53 You're absolutely right. Big difference. I think a lot of the drama with Iran & Israel right now is to make oil prices go up to help countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, and UAE. For Trump to be setting up crooked real estate transactions would be hard to believe for anyone else.
880 2018-05-15 21:57:52 I can't figure out why any Jew would EVER vote for a Democrat again. Not 1 showed up to dedication of Embassy in Eternal Capital of Israel.

887 2018-05-15 21:57:03 RT EdKrassen: Trump backs out of the Iran deal, causing Iran to resume their nuclear program. Now Trump will use this as a reason to go to war with Iran, inflating oil prices further, and leading to an increased value in Rosneft, Russian's state-run oil giant, owned partiall…
888 2018-05-15 21:56:58 Follow the resources. Middle East = oil. Afghanistan = minerals. If there where major natural resources in Haiti or Rawanda...
889 2018-05-15 21:56:43 So im at work right now and i was emptying an oil drum and the air tube to auck the oil out spit motor oil all over me. My nose, mouth, eyes, you name it. The craps nasty...
890 2018-05-15 21:56:33 Yea it's matte enough to help with the oil without making you super matte to where it clings to dry areas. L'Oreal infallible pro matte is REALLY good for oil but it's also SUPER matte
891 2018-05-15 21:56:20 Thank god I never stopped eating them!  And btw the coconut oil fad? Same composition as duck fat just not as tasty.

894 2018-05-15 21:55:49 For the amount the oil for my car costs and the time I'd be putting in trying to figure it out myself without breaking something, I'm just gonna take it to a specialized service place and make them do it. o..o Someday I'll learn.
895 2018-05-15 21:55:33 Putin is obviously behind Standing Rock, because more oil in the ground here means more market share for Russia!
896 2018-05-15 21:55:26 No-one round here has mentioned Golden Signals, and if they did, people might think they were trying to sell some form of snake oil
897 2018-05-15 21:55:04 Islamic leaders do a lot of American arse licking. The Americans do it back. It's called greed for oil and money
898 2018-05-15 21:54:48 @FordService what would do if I told you that one of your ford quick lanes stole 4 quarts of oil from me?
899 2018-05-15 21:54:44 Canavan - stand on the cliffs at Yalta and watch the right whales and their calves, then tell me seismic explosions and oil drilling in the Bight are good things.

910 2018-05-15 21:53:10 @richardbranson says at #EDU2018 that Canada's oil and gas industry has to have a better PR face to the outside world.
911 2018-05-15 21:53:06 I’d buy body lava for the name and packaging but mixing a body oil and pops highlight is actually a better product lmao
912 2018-05-15 21:53:05 Oil and gas air pollution may be invisible to the naked eye but elected officials can’t ignore over 30,000 Pennsylvanians demanding that we must #cutmethane pollution. Join us on 5/22 as we rally in Harrisburg for clean air and a clean budget.
913 2018-05-15 21:52:58 That is kind of a precious photo. She looks so sweet.
914 2018-05-15 21:52:58 Ok, u do realize that those tax cuts for the rich are permanent...And the little money we have been getting in our paychecks are going in our gas tanks...So corporate wins twice...Lower taxes and higher revenue for the oil industry...
915 2018-05-15 21:52:56 Yes and nato is a product of cooperation like eu, that is what hold price of oil low and economy booming, but children of those immigrant will get a job, everybody wants an iphone and you cant buy it without a job on social security...

920 2018-05-15 21:52:25 So is our Shale Oil industry. Why didn't you do a commentary on that?
921 2018-05-15 21:52:19 They love their Blood Oil down east
922 2018-05-15 21:52:09 Why are you not reporting on the 19% Rosneft oil stake purchase in relation to this story. The Qatari guy was involved in both only days apart.
923 2018-05-15 21:52:04 Nobody is emotional here. At least I don’t see it that way, please cite an emotional statement from me. I’m curious, how is the US shale oil reserves driving up gas prices? That makes no sense. And you agreed with me on future pricing (hence the 2/3 month comment from me earlier)
924 2018-05-15 21:51:42 Huh. It's almost like the oil companies have influence over the press . . .
925 2018-05-15 21:51:36 Thank you. Donald is walking all over our nation's laws. His fans refuse to face reality. If he was an honest man, with scruples, the Democrats would back him for our nation. He is a snake oil salesman.

928 2018-05-15 21:51:01 The oil fields of Iran and Saudi Arabia were to be next. A war with Iran was desired since the New World Order crowd wanted an End Times war.

930 2018-05-15 21:50:54 Much confusion is sown in the media about the Iraq Wars, ISIS, Israel’s role, and the ongoing battles in Syria. The truth is that 911 was an inside job by the Bush Administration to provide an excuse to invade Iraq and seize the oil fields.

952 2018-05-15 21:48:13 MINT TEA soothes the stomach a lot. tiger balm oil (chinese medicine) is a topical treatment that soothes the muscles and stomach when they're spasming so i use that a lot when it hurts.
953 2018-05-15 21:48:08 Wa sherey team ibile.

964 2018-05-15 21:47:16 Fine. Come during the day, drive my car to the garage, change the oil, drive my car back.
965 2018-05-15 21:47:06 It all depends on what the money is spent on. But there is also a ipper limit on how expensive oil the world economy can take.
966 2018-05-15 21:47:04 Niggas couldn’t wait to pull them bikes out lol ain’t even get a oil change
967 2018-05-15 21:47:03 This govt has released more money for infrastructure despite a recession and low oil prices, than any other Govt since 1999, yet supposedly intelligent Nigerians will still ask, what have they done? 

I'm beginning to feel like its more of dislike for the man, not his performance
968 2018-05-15 21:47:00 My mom wouldn't be my mom if she didn't turn the bottles of Kombucha I drank into

2. to put oil which she uses to cook

970 2018-05-15 21:46:52 Got my oil changed at the firestone on base and fack this is taking forever
971 2018-05-15 21:46:42 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?
972 2018-05-15 21:46:38 The issue that you are spoiling for a Twitter fight with me, after probably charging your phone with generator power in an oil producing country, is just precious!
973 2018-05-15 21:46:37 Chef Gusteau cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with Play-Doh.
974 2018-05-15 21:46:30 Based on typical LNP actions, the intention appears to be degrade the GBR to the point where it’s natural value is so low that the people won’t object to oil mining on the reef. Think about what they are doing to the ABC.

976 2018-05-15 21:46:24 Bernie Sanders raises all that money on donations in the age of crowd funding and the progressives want the government to be involved with (i.e. fuck up) all this stuff?  Free to get educated for what jobs? I hate this dreadfully non specific snail oil bull shit.
977 2018-05-15 21:46:21 @Cheesecake has always been overpriced and marginal food. but employing immature racists is a new low. And they haven't said a WORD about this incident.

979 2018-05-15 21:46:14 Does he realize that he now works for the American people, not the oil companies or K Street?
980 2018-05-15 21:46:03 I figured it was 49th or 50th. . We suck so bad. We have ag, oil and gas and are still in top 5 for being the poorest. Reckon there’s something fishy going on?  
981 2018-05-15 21:45:58 It matters when it prevents a mine tragedy like Blankenships. It matters when an oil spill is prevented after BP. 

The road to hell is paved with people who let other people die because they didn’t want to interrupt capitalism.
982 2018-05-15 21:45:50 @IngSocBob 
Wondering if you caught the PBS special "Civilizations or First Civilizations (?)".

There was a great, albeit short, bit about a woman entomologist, illustrator, water colorist & oil painter.

985 2018-05-15 21:45:34 Wow. Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world. Now they have to import oil because the corrupt socialist govt has destroyed the national oil industry.

Ugh.....
993 2018-05-15 21:44:06 Yes. Not sure I see the problem. Gaza lacks infrastructure, and they depend on Israel for utilities. Just like most EU countries depend on Saudi Arabia for oil. This isn't an uncommon thing.

China is Iran's largest oil consumer, and given the Chinese yuan currency will be used, the country's money will gain some international standing.
1015 2018-05-15 21:42:19 I think it's easy to get laid in Nigeria if you're an oil and gas engineer.  That's what every Nigerian man has on their twitter accounts.  @enywaru come school a bro.

1022 2018-05-15 21:41:38 Btw ladies this dry glow oil by sol de janeiro is bomb. It’s a dry oil so it doesn’t feel sticky. It also gives you a nice sheen. Plus it smells so good 
1023 2018-05-15 21:41:38 Tea-tree oil doesn't smell good so don't wonder (I love it, but everyone else is freaking out everytime I use it xD). Good luck! I know how annoying this is! x

1025 2018-05-15 21:41:09 That's right: #Line3 is one of several Enbridge pipelines that together carry more than 2.5M barrels per day through MN. About 400K of that gets diverted to other lines that carry it to the Twin Cities. The rest of the oil continues on, thru Wisc, to Chicago, Ontario, the Gulf.

1028 2018-05-15 21:40:42 But I talked to my favorite industry insider about the oil change analogy once, thinking that the industry didn’t like it, and he said the truly preventive stuff (eg vaccines) is so cost-effective that they don’t really mind paying for it

1043 2018-05-15 21:38:39 Look at it another way. Young people don’t want to work for (very high paying) oil companies  any more. They want to work for  green energy ones. That’s a BIG change and another sign fossil fuels are on their way out.

1050 2018-05-15 21:37:48 A) I didn’t blame O for high oil prices, But he could have helped more B) ANWAR drilling was approved 9 months ago. Takes a while to actually get oil to market. C) your a hypocrite because you blame everyone but Obama.
1051 2018-05-15 21:37:38 Over php 1 increase in oil prices? Yes its world market price but it is also affected by the additional excise tax and Forex
1052 2018-05-15 21:37:30 5)The greatest sin of burning oil is we need it for other things.  Supposedly, only 30% of our crude oil use is transportation fuels.  The rest becomes other things like our plastics.

1075 2018-05-15 21:34:17 Texas has great wind resources as well as solar. Wind and solar get a federal subsidy. Both LA and TX has oil and gas. Ga imports everything but solar. Because Texas is deregulated, they have smaller reserve margin and experience more brown-outs. We maintain high reserve for biz.

1080 2018-05-15 21:33:42 - we should put that in hot oil. - Frank, you have to stop suggesting that about everything you see.
1081 2018-05-15 21:33:31 If we had been drilling on federal lands and in ANWAR under Obama we would have driven down the price of oil by now. Another issue is our capacity to refine oil into gas is limited because Eco-Wackos have prevented the construction of oil refineries for more than 30 years!!

1086 2018-05-15 21:32:53 Correct....the fact the already very large engines were joined, meant that thermal expansion became a terrible issue, causing big oil leaks in the joints, which then went on fire when it hit the exhaust stubs... a lot. (No decent rubber for seals in Germany)

1100 2018-05-15 21:31:22 Indeed. Oil market rewinds and unwinds are never boring.
1101 2018-05-15 21:31:09 Have you tried tea-tree oil yet? It helps me with loose spots and problem areas.
1102 2018-05-15 21:30:57 In July of 2008, oil peaked $145.85 a barrel and prices topped out at around $4.30 a gallon.

Here it is, ten years later, and its running $72 per barrel and gas is $3.09.

That’s a load of horse shit!
1103 2018-05-15 21:30:56 Coconut oil gave me the winning Powerball numbers!

1105 2018-05-15 21:30:46 I used Bio oil- it worked great for scars I had on arms - took a full month of two times a day- thanks for sharing this @MissRBaller ,  always laughing with every video you post- I know my neighbour must think I'm crazy over here alone hahaha have a great day!!

1114 2018-05-15 21:29:12 but i feel like argon oil would be fine then?
1115 2018-05-15 21:28:59 i love baby oil & coco butter

1117 2018-05-15 21:28:53 Enjoyed the lovely sunshine, and practicing with my oil paints for a new project. 
1118 2018-05-15 21:28:48 Qatari and many other countries were in contact with the Trump admin to invest cash in the U.S.A.
Billionaires from china, alibaba, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, many arab oil countries. But what happened to Russia? You’re throwing spaghetti at this point. What a joke. Stick to the NDA
1119 2018-05-15 21:28:28 Of course my fuel and oil light had to come on during the way home. 
1120 2018-05-15 21:28:15 Better solutions are to (1) get rid of lanes for cars and give them to buses/trains, (2) add fees/taxes to driving and use that revenue to reduce transit fares .  Gas is $7/gal in Netherlands, Norway even though they have more oil than they know what to do with.
1121 2018-05-15 21:28:06 Wow after having paid what I did to get my oil changed I'm selling my car and buying a horse.
1122 2018-05-15 21:28:05 I think I would pay a lot of money for an oil change service that just came to work during the day and changed my oil in situ.
1123 2018-05-15 21:28:01 @UnicornGrocery do you sell palm oil-free stock cubes? Can't find them anywhere, best I've managed is sustainably sourced palm oil ones but would prefer to avoid completely!

He brought her a gift

pleading for redemption in hallowed

1126 2018-05-15 21:27:30 Nothing says anxiety like waiting to hear your total after getting your oil changed.
1127 2018-05-15 21:27:30 Better than the oil covered concrete we normally use 
1128 2018-05-15 21:27:25 ol leland and shrimp boy. the california double standard.
1129 2018-05-15 21:27:22 This shortage seems interesting, given that pronounced protesting against drilling in the bight has prevented oil companies so far. Enforced shortage?
1130 2018-05-15 21:27:20 Moringa oil is rich in omega-9 fatty acids, vitamin C, and vitamin E that help seek out free radicals and protect the organs from excess inflammation and strain.

1132 2018-05-15 21:27:09 I’m getting mine down tomorrow! And actually, as long as your remover isn’t oil based they stay on pretty well! Shop around and don’t go for the cheapest deal. Can get pricy but for special events it’s great
1133 2018-05-15 21:27:06 Yeah idk maybe I’ll try again. But I use a tea tree wash from the body shop. Tea tree oil seems to work great on problematic skin.

1135 2018-05-15 21:25:54 An American multi-national leaves Venezuela citing economy which is being strangled by US sanction and an unsuccessful CIA coup.

Venezuela has one of the largest oil reserves on earth. Completely coincidental, obvs.

#JustAnotherSlave
1136 2018-05-15 21:25:50 TMX won't be used to get oil to non US markets either.

Because if that were true the existing TM would be getting oil to non US markets , but it doesn't.

 It just loads tankers for the US.
1137 2018-05-15 21:25:33 coconut oil literally fixes everything
1138 2018-05-15 21:25:31 Oh bless.  Check Google for treatment with Tea Tree Oil....And I expect you already know, but use loads of conditioner when you wash your hair which makes the nits slide off.  Also blow drying your hair on high heat will help keep them at bay....
1139 2018-05-15 21:25:15 My child was denied his medicinal cannabis oil in Children's Hospital because they have a policy against it because they're are federally funded. Things need to change on a federal level for patients continuity of care. #freethebud @NORML

P.S. you missed the clothes
1142 2018-05-15 21:24:48 Because we don't extract oil.
1143 2018-05-15 21:24:40 how long does it take to do an oil change
1144 2018-05-15 21:24:29 The whole discipline has failed to stand up for itself. It has been too meek, too naive, often assuming scientific credibility (huge research base) would bring influence, and happy with technical roles. Meanwhile, snake oil such as Performance Management has gained power.
1145 2018-05-15 21:24:29 Using oil #Hypocrite
1146 2018-05-15 21:24:20 He ignores the fact that many electric cars are powered by home solar systems. And that many electric companies are increasing the percentage of solar and wind to generate electricity for those cars.

He ignores pollution caused by drilling for and transporting oil. & oil spills.
1147 2018-05-15 21:24:17 The main driver for the Iranian economy was to be its gas and oil sector, which needs the expertise, equipment and capital of the large companies to develop it. They all have interests in the US they’re not going to give up to work in Iran...
1148 2018-05-15 21:24:02 The worst one I ever had was made from camphor, capsicum, menthol, cayenne pepper, and pine needle oil among other things. It was like being exorcised in a medicine glass.
1149 2018-05-15 21:23:54 A few drops of oil into your foundation is lifesaving
1150 2018-05-15 21:23:44 cbd oil works realy well for me x

1152 2018-05-15 21:23:16 Breaking: US/UK along with Israel and Saudi Arabia are funding and arming ISIS, Al Quaida and other head chopping Jihadists in the Middle East. The US is still kissing the Oil Cartels A$$es in Saudi Arabia even though they've acknowledge that the funded the attacks on 9/11.
1153 2018-05-15 21:23:12 apple vinegar and water, lavender oil in a bath also helps
1154 2018-05-15 21:23:07 yeah when i was trying to grow my lashes coconut oil was perfect. or castor oil. never use latisse or those lash growing serums 
1155 2018-05-15 21:23:05 @RepDLamborn this country has 41% new oil reserves in extracting oil from coal the plant if built emits no pollution in air or water. Kentucky alone has more oil than IRAN has . lets build it not expensive. WW 11 the plant process was perfected so let our country be stronger.
1156 2018-05-15 21:23:01 Best part:

“The arrest swept Yee and his associate Keith Jackson, 51, up in charges alongside some of the city's most notorious characters, notable among them Chinatown gangster Raymond "Shrimp Boy" Chow.”

Everyone needs a Shrimp Boy in their ‘hood
1157 2018-05-15 21:22:55 I would love the country. I know it -- somebody said, "you shouldn't say, "oh, this is guiling to build. The whole plan would I rig the oil." we should take care of back. China lifter an unbelievable crowd. This is a jokingly. Our military has to be strengthened
1158 2018-05-15 21:22:24 Wal-mart once sent me a giant bottle of baby oil with no explanation. I have never ordered anything online from Wal-mart ever.
1159 2018-05-15 21:22:23 I’m finna get a oil change and then Ima hit y up
1160 2018-05-15 21:22:02 All actions taken without the best interest of the future leaders of tommorow is a failure. The gift of our unending natural resource is not oil but the younger generations.  What ever we do should be toward the development and interest of the future.
1161 2018-05-15 21:22:01 @LouDobbs why are you staying quiet on oil prices?  You are a champion of not letting speculators run us into a recession?  Why is our President @realdonaldtrump?
1162 2018-05-15 21:22:00 Looks like an oil or rubber fire to me. Very black smoke suggests it.
1163 2018-05-15 21:21:41 It is down somewhat from 2014-2016 highs from oil & gas income. My thoughts before around $1,800/ac. Area operators not very positive with drought & commodity prices.
1164 2018-05-15 21:21:37 I have been to Borneo and was shocked at the palm oil issue but it is a nightmare trying to avoid it. Major corporations need pressure applied to do more.
1165 2018-05-15 21:21:34 This guy will never win anything… Never seen anyone with such negative body language… Snake oil salesman
1166 2018-05-15 21:21:25 honestly, making your own is best, personally. brown sugar, honey, olive oil w lemon does wonders for me.
1167 2018-05-15 21:21:18 i had symptoms some time ago and i think some of it was stress, some of it was ed recovery weight redistribution, and some of it was just ibs so the gp gave me peppermint oil capsules & a tablet for ibs symptoms and it felt much better - didn’t need to cut lots out!
1168 2018-05-15 21:21:12 Actually aloe vera is less messy, it sticks to the skin and it doesn’t transfer like oil.

1173 2018-05-15 21:20:47 Islamic military counter terrorism coalition ...... 1-oil rich states funded, 2-military agencies, 3-counter terrorism, 4-intelligence gathering and collaboration. ... mandate is clear .... liberation of : Yemen, Syria, Iran, Palestine .... Pakistan perhaps.
1174 2018-05-15 21:20:44 I check all ingredients on all products and refuse to buy those that contain palm oil. A small voice trying to do my best and thank you for raising awareness and I will always retweet you and carry on campaigning.
1175 2018-05-15 21:20:13 Dude, I love fucking frying stuff! Just the sensation of putting food in a pan of oil, and watching it sizzle, is invigorating to me!
1176 2018-05-15 21:20:12 I never said killing people doesn't matter. You realize religion is the cause of these wars. Oil has been added as $ has taken one side. These wars will still be going after our grandkids have passed
1177 2018-05-15 21:20:07 I haven’t had an oil change in over a year lmao what the fuck is wrong with me
1178 2018-05-15 21:19:52 Why would you bring a rock to a gun fight.
1179 2018-05-15 21:19:51 Huh funny how we went to war with Iraq + not Saudi Arabia, where the 9/11 attackers came from. 

War for oil is terrorism.
1180 2018-05-15 21:19:48 I bought oil stocks. You owe me dinner.

1183 2018-05-15 21:19:44 I get so flustered when I go to get my oil changed that when they ask me to check my lights I get all sweaty and always hit the wrong buttons
1184 2018-05-15 21:19:27 If the gas tax was the sole driver of the cost of gas rising, it wouldn't be rising nationwide. Kenny is taking a national problem and trying to make it local, because he is bad at local politics. The price for a barrel of oil is climbing because of trump scrapping the iran deal
1185 2018-05-15 21:19:14 Shut your pie-hole about Cannibis. More people making money in this sector than stupid oil.
1186 2018-05-15 21:19:09 Though of course AC season impact depends a lot on power source. Initially when I looked at some of these trends it was to better understand seasonal oil consumption swing in KSA, elsewhere raises interesting questions about power mix and grid resilience.
1187 2018-05-15 21:19:04 I ain’t covering myself in no glittery oil or lotion. Ick
1188 2018-05-15 21:19:03 Thats what liberals want to control all major industries so they can charge what they want . we need new oil supplies in this country and new refineries to drop the prices to what they were over 30 years ago

1195 2018-05-15 21:18:27 as it turns out, just throwing some olive oil and pepper on your pasta tastes just as good as most sauces
1196 2018-05-15 21:18:20 Interest rates rose today; oil prices are high burning up all of the minimal few dollars that came as a result of the tax cut; giving billions to billionaires has put our society in hock and unless reversed will bankrupt the country
1197 2018-05-15 21:18:02 Coconut oil is the GOAT 
1198 2018-05-15 21:17:51 We all need to go back to school for classes in critical thinking because marketing + the internet = too powerful and is further fueling the race of super idiots who eagerly tout and & spend on snake oil and believe in all kinds of nonsense and I feel like facts no longer matter.
1199 2018-05-15 21:17:35 Chavez seized private property and  companies (that he then made unproductive), militarized the government,put the cubans in strategic positions,let his friends establish the narco route, created lots of hatred, embezzled,etc but he was lucky to have high oil prices to buy people
1200 2018-05-15 21:17:34 OH f*ck yes.  I listened to someone once and i'm seriously pale.  I was so burnt I had to sleep on the floor on wet towels with wet towels on me.  And dont use that bronze lovely tanning oil if you dont have the beginnings of a tan.  You will fry
1201 2018-05-15 21:17:27 Well Obama and to some extent Bush were not making it easy to find and drill new sources of oil and increase supply. However, don’t you find it hypocritical that you Blame Bush and Trump for high gas prices, but Not Obama?
1202 2018-05-15 21:17:22 If you can use nuclear power instead of oil during every day use, say...in vehicles, you would be on to something...

1217 2018-05-15 21:14:59 Has to give them money because he can’t get their oil to the coast because of his BC buddies. Alberta will be as bad as Ontario before long and then what will Quebec do for money?
1218 2018-05-15 21:14:46 @replouiegohmert our countery can put 41% more oil reserves by extract oil from coal which is more oil than IRAN. plant emits no pollution in air or water we need to build this. in WW11 process was perfected and worked. creates 500 000 new jobs , no college ED. needed veterans.

1224 2018-05-15 21:14:34 @GilesMacDonogh @J_VoiceUK sounds a bit like USA corporations about then as well standard oil to name one
1225 2018-05-15 21:14:32 I’m getting an oil change right
1226 2018-05-15 21:14:21 Omg do u even kn how anything. One of the biggest oil exports of last yr was America so we dont need Russia and we left the agreement as many said it was bullshit. Even @SenSchumer was against it when Obama signed it until it fit his agenda! Smfh u post such bs, thanks #maga2020
1227 2018-05-15 21:14:21 Yeah America never gets involved in the Middle East for oil money, Trump just truly has strong convictions on the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and is defo not gonna rob Israel blind, you're right.

1234 2018-05-15 21:13:11 I will eat any kind of potato salad made with anything by anyone. I'm Sicilian and eating is what we do best. But if I were making it, there would be garlic and olive oil involved.
1235 2018-05-15 21:13:02 Thank uuu! I used to use tea tee oil but it made my skin extremely oily, and I already have oily skin.
1236 2018-05-15 21:12:44 The oil might have been lube. I dunno, I saw it on Reddit on the front page
1237 2018-05-15 21:12:44 Tried it the 1st time back in 2010 too much oil. Tried it last year it didn't move me. I want #SoulFood
1238 2018-05-15 21:12:41 This is a terrible dumbass headline on  terrible dumbas article about a study that doesn’t say anything and looks like Big Oil PR.
1239 2018-05-15 21:12:09 Leaving the Iran deal is a gift to Russia as crude oil prices will go up

Again Trump base will pay for the orange fuhrer's policies. They can hate themselves into submission, higher gas prices, no social security or disability.  @GOP is just going to let us die on our own soil.
1240 2018-05-15 21:12:07 I started reading Pride and Prejudice (I've never read it) during my oil change today, and I realized I didn't have a pen on me to underline the OMG quotes, so I had to use lip gloss instead (not my good kind).
1241 2018-05-15 21:12:06 There’s a high chance that it’s a thing in Japan. 
I’ve seen a Japanese gameshow of oiled up people (in a scuba suit) trying to go up stairs while oil is being poured down the stairs.

1243 2018-05-15 21:11:46 Is there anything more boring than waiting to get an oil change by yourself?
1244 2018-05-15 21:11:43 Aloe vera works wonders for damn near everything. Tea tree oil helps too
1245 2018-05-15 21:11:42 Why is it necessary to have an oil pipeline cross the straights in the first place. It delivers no oil to the lower peninsula. After crossing the straights it only moves Canadian tar sands oil to Canadian refiners. Run the pipeline thru Canada.
1246 2018-05-15 21:11:36 Still fighting thank you and trying natural remedies and CBD cannabis oil,  It's not beaten me yet and still trying to improve dementia care and awareness #Alzheimers #dementiaawareness #HateCancer #NotgivingUp  :)
1247 2018-05-15 21:11:26 Is all the oil gone?
1248 2018-05-15 21:11:23 How many hours a week are you working in the oil field? Are you week on week off?
1249 2018-05-15 21:11:15 He’s literally saying all provinces matter, oil isn’t going to sustain us much longer. His job is to do what’s best for CANADA not what’s best for Alberta
1250 2018-05-15 21:10:49 Oil producing states (Texas, Alaska, North Dakota, Oklahoma etc.) seem to be hit especially hard.
1251 2018-05-15 21:10:47 15/05/1911 – La Corte Suprema degli Stati Uniti dichiara che la Standard Oil possiede un "irragionevole" monopolio, in base allo Sherman Antitrust Act, e ordina il discioglimento della compagnia.

1257 2018-05-15 21:10:05 I don't know what I'm doing differently, but my skin is clearing up to the nicest it's been in a hot minute. 

If you struggle with breakouts, invest in Neutrogena's grapefruit scrub and was ur face 2 times a day and look into essential oil scrubs (bc they make ur face so soft)
1258 2018-05-15 21:10:02 Yeah and the amount of oil and salt that goes into his cooking videos is ridiculous! He needs to stop.
1259 2018-05-15 21:09:56 Coconut oil has so many beneficial properties!
1260 2018-05-15 21:09:47 Today I learned that if you ever need to look bloody/like you're scraped up, red oil pastel does the trick.

The things you learn in art class.
1261 2018-05-15 21:09:44 So we don’t have to send oil drillers to space this time?
1262 2018-05-15 21:09:35 Sounds more like a several hundred million dollar real deal issue for you, POTUS- your fees on the Russian oil deal with Ahmed Al-Rumaihi. And then another interesting $500 million issue with Indonesia and the ZTE mystery. You are the Billion Dollar Man! Not Billionaire- Billion.
1263 2018-05-15 21:09:25 Bombay potatoes are bless but another flex is jerk flavoured roasties. Just dust the hot oil with some jerk seasoning before you add the potatoes and POW. (Add lime juice and black pepper for extra pow)
1264 2018-05-15 21:09:17 Time to get my oil changed again. 
1265 2018-05-15 21:09:16 Damn $70 for a oil change 
1266 2018-05-15 21:09:16 True, but nowhere near as bad as what's happening in the US. In fact, it was much worse here when Justin Trudeau's father, Pierre, was PM & initiated a National Energy Program making Alberta "share" its  vast oil revenue. Democracy seems to be dying everywhere. It is frightening!
1267 2018-05-15 21:09:14 Even Simon can’t rescue this dog of a show. Oil and water do not mix and that’s Jo and Simon it’s a recipe for disaster. Dull dull and duller. Get out Simon and save yourself!

1285 2018-05-15 21:05:58 Coconut oil cured my relationship with my dad.
1286 2018-05-15 21:05:56 Hi Peter , what types of oils have you tried that you found ineffective? I enjoy making a wide variety of oil based capsules & products and have seen great results.  Maybe I can help you find an oil that might be beneficial ? DM me if you’d like to chat 
1287 2018-05-15 21:05:55 Iraq never was a problem of the US.
The intel was all lies; the goal was regime change to control/produce more oil.
The place was left a shambles, homes destroyed, families without parents or children, refugees all over the ME & Europe.
No WMDs ever found.
1288 2018-05-15 21:05:36 Like? Just normal coconut oil used for cooking???
1289 2018-05-15 21:05:22 Indeed. But it points to why we should rather question the real power rather than the inferior but supported power of Israel. The US has little to gain from its support of Israel beside a vociferous Jewish lobby group. And supporting it is way expensive. 
Oil and Power eh?

Checkin-  are you goin',

1317 2018-05-15 21:01:49 No, we don't. I even posted (conservative) industry figures that showed we have about 30 years left.  The Scotsman say 11bn, Oil & Gas UK say up to 20bn, the BBC say 24bn.... every expert says we have way more than 10 years, but you know better (or are you just joking again LOL)

1335 2018-05-15 20:59:58 It was quite expensive, but you get a red/black KMC chain and superlight cassette (11-28) with the mechs, brakes and levers. Plus hoses, bleeding kit and oil. I have got a Q-Ring 2inPower chainset to go with it. In total about £4K 
1336 2018-05-15 20:59:56 What about physical oil ( trading)? Same there?

1343 2018-05-15 20:58:31 if we would have stayed out that region when the fall of Ottoman Empire, this could have sorted it self by know with little casualties. Instead we found oil & we needed to stick our nose over in that region for powerful interests. Now it’s matter of prophecy!
1344 2018-05-15 20:58:29 I’m a little partial to a V6. I suppose as someone who works in Oil & Gas going #EV might appear short sighted, fortunately my gas makes electricity & my oil makes petrol!

1370 2018-05-15 20:56:14 If they can find a practical way to do this and try not too make this mostly about competing with profits made by oil. And prove that not only does it save money, but the initial cost is practical. I am all for it. I would love to have cleaner air and a greener earth

1376 2018-05-15 20:55:29 Nice and the oil didn’t have to last for 8 days...wait wrong way of life, congrats.
1377 2018-05-15 20:55:29 Royal Dutch Shell’s acquisition of a small British energy firm shows how the world’s oil giants are navigating a shift away from their core products.
1378 2018-05-15 20:55:28 Got my oil changed & tires rotated today & the dealership told me I have 3 more oil changes from them & Chrysler gave me 4 more free ones #blessyou
1379 2018-05-15 20:55:26 All he does is fail. 
-58 dead at Israel
-North Korea deal falling apart.
-Going to start a trade war with NATO allies over Iran deal? 
-oil prices soaring
-Supporting Chinese maker of phones that spy on USA
-$500 million emoluments violation 

Pull your head out.
1380 2018-05-15 20:55:06 Then there’s this nagging thought that the Australian Government wants us to believe oil reserves are low so they will get the people’s support to pollute a world-renown, pristine ocean sanctuary. #auspol
1381 2018-05-15 20:55:00 cinnamon, olive, jojoba & aloe oil for my hair >>>>
1382 2018-05-15 20:54:54 @greenpeaceusa I could take this seriously if refined products did make up 90% of what the protester brought to the photo. Think ahead don't use products refined from heavy oil. Also Shell is one of the energy companies currently committed to being 100% green on a timeline.
1383 2018-05-15 20:54:53 I'm going to say coconut oil as I think that's the standard answer these days, or cannabis oil, either/or
1384 2018-05-15 20:54:53 Damn I forgot to do oil change in my car
1385 2018-05-15 20:54:42 Maybe Lebanon should start drilling for oil. We'd be all over them like a rash for a trade, sorry arms deal, if they struck any!
1386 2018-05-15 20:54:29 Coinbase is fucking gay and takes it in the ass for doing this. They ran out of baby oil and now raw dog you
1387 2018-05-15 20:54:26 If you do let me know how it turns out. I saw another one with baby oil.
1388 2018-05-15 20:54:22 I just drink a gallon of water everyday and this netrogena face wash and some am pm cerave lotion and bio oil

1391 2018-05-15 20:54:04 My MBA is a fact. The figures I gave regarding Oil/Gas prices are facts. Ur overemotional subjective reaction to my academic credentials is irrelevant. Entitled to ur opinion of course, but irrelevant to the original post. #1A over feelings period.
1392 2018-05-15 20:53:57 Today, our allies are meeting with Iranians to save the deal and continue reciprocal trade. Iran, Russia and China are making millions because Trump withdrew, freeing up oil trade with Iran. Free Beacon is crap.
1393 2018-05-15 20:53:48 @Keir_Starmer I've listened patiently to his caveat ridden snake oil double speak since 2016, I've waited for him to shift the argument but we're still nowhere close to an acceptable position so I give up, Corbyn is a bloody #brexiter and Keir I had faith in you, well no longer.
1394 2018-05-15 20:53:39 $CL_F oil shrugging off that news so far after an initial spike down.
1395 2018-05-15 20:53:22 False  Iraq was brought to heel because it invaded an ally and violated cease-fire terms.  Nothing to do with Israel and only tangentially to oil not directly.
1396 2018-05-15 20:53:18 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
1397 2018-05-15 20:53:15 Sorry, as everything else you've said about Scotland has been wildly wrong I presumed this was more of your amazing research.  Let's try to get one thing right: in "real terms" how much oil is left?
1398 2018-05-15 20:52:59 Via freaking we now have more oil reserves than the rest of the world. It's gonna be okay, the US will come bail out France again, next time they get invaded
1399 2018-05-15 20:52:51 The no side are absolute snake oil salesmen, the language they use and the verbal gymnastics they employ are so dishonest I feel oily Just listening to these people. #repealthe8th lads. #rtept

1403 2018-05-15 20:52:13 Well there’s several logs on that fire.  It started way back when when all the oil people from Houston had a dust up with the bank people at the Cloverleaf Hotel.  Then there was that America’s Team football documentary.  Jerry Jones calling Reliant Stadium roof gap toothed
1404 2018-05-15 20:52:07 @Andrearenee00 Hey Andrea,
I went to Walgreens but they didnt carry the Palmer's Cleansing Oil you recommended maybe Ill try Walmart?

1408 2018-05-15 20:51:37 yeah essential oil - its really uplifting
1409 2018-05-15 20:51:32 I hate going to get an oil change.
1410 2018-05-15 20:51:24 I'm convinced red states have so many assholes in them because of the consumption of oil, lead and coal ash that has seeped into their drinking water.

1413 2018-05-15 20:51:12 That’s because the entire US hegemony is hanging by a thread with the Petro-dollar. Our USD is already worthless and just illusory. So if our oil dominance evaporates....so does the whole US-centric global power structure. Hence, the recently announced Petro-yuan.
1414 2018-05-15 20:51:12 hello i would like a sample of this oil paint. yes right into my hand. thank you. *licks it off*
1415 2018-05-15 20:50:59 This is a blatant lie.  Iran is estimated at having the 4th largest oil reserve.  They are also a known terror sponsor. Their nuclear ambition was not for energy.  Therefore they need no alternative plan.    You people are pathetic
1416 2018-05-15 20:50:55 NWO Rothchilds, Saudis,  and Soros want war. They make money on war, oil, human trafficking, arms...   They keep us all divided and fighting. They created this, not Trump.
1417 2018-05-15 20:50:55 Kindly Mr.Mwakesi advice the ministry to take up the left pieces of the Turkana oil mine and #makeKenyaGREAT
1418 2018-05-15 20:50:55 That should be y'alls first date  You should go surprise her!! Y'all could tweet pics to us  we know you got all that money working in the oil business 
1419 2018-05-15 20:50:44 Dems: "Gas prices are going up because Trump backed out of the Iran deal"

But Dems fail to hold Obama to his campaign promise of "relying on our own resources and growing less dependent on foreign oil"

Yes, he actually said that

1421 2018-05-15 20:50:33 All I wanted was my tires and oil changed... it's now been about 50 minutes and I'm still sitting here. Normally I love Mr. Lube, but today I am NOT a happy customer.
1422 2018-05-15 20:50:32 Back when McDonald's fries were good, they cooked them in beef tallow.  But they were shamed into switching to vegetable oil by "experts." Of course, those experts were wrong--beef tallow is much better for you than vegetable oil.
1423 2018-05-15 20:50:24 Earlier I biked to traders jo...pulling up to the curb at my apartment I hear a SMASH and see my precious olive oil all over the pavement
1424 2018-05-15 20:50:15 There is an illegal Airbnb in my building. I live in a lower-priced building in NYC. Why is the investigation our responsibility? You make billions with no regard for laws or personal responsibility. Don’t hide behind some fake morality. You are no better than a big oil company

1429 2018-05-15 20:50:06 Every time I take my car for an oil change, I always feel like I’m getting played with all their “recommendations”. 
1430 2018-05-15 20:49:44 Coal riding to the 90s...oil reaching out to the 80s~and we have a Tenaga tariff fixing in June.

1439 2018-05-15 20:49:03 Yes and I would agree with you but the crappy part in all of this, there is no way of knowing with any of the players from this generation.
1440 2018-05-15 20:48:52 I'd be a really great ancient Roman aristocrat b/c I have strong opinions about fish sauce & oil & tiles.
1441 2018-05-15 20:48:44 Waiting for my oil to get changed so I can drive up to @astralmagick house!! So excited to see my boo
1442 2018-05-15 20:48:32 Whatcha thinking?  Ive cut most of my oil long, just have a long XBHO and building a small short in CLCO...
1443 2018-05-15 20:48:12 My oil change stick says 195k, but my car is at 201k...living dangerously, feeling rebelous.

1450 2018-05-15 20:47:19 Uncle Sam wins big, getting to finance his massive deficit spending with a stronger dollar. It's possible.  We will have to see. Interesting that copper outperformed gold today, albeit on the downside. Meanwhile, I expect the oil market is in a world of its own.

1463 2018-05-15 20:45:38 You are getting nothing done....which had been your plan all along. You and BC leader are in cahoots or you would have turned oil off already. May 31 is almost here and pipeline will be done and you will have won.

1471 2018-05-15 20:44:29 Hey trump supporters, so it’s totally cool for a hostile foreign gov to hack our democracy and spend 200 mill on electing trump so he can raise their oil prices???
1472 2018-05-15 20:44:25 I literally have no idea how Italian's are so slim, all I've had to choose from these past two days is a lot of cheese, salami, pastries, carbs and then everything is covered in butter and olive oil 
1473 2018-05-15 20:44:19 Sooo where you get an oil change at?
1474 2018-05-15 20:44:13 Yeah, 5,000 x 5,000 meter landscapes. Heck that oil painting effect rendering at even 150 meters was getting bad FPS simply because it was doing so many more calls. Went from 1500 calls down to like 120 by turning the effect off. Guess the effect wasn't made for optimization lol.

1487 2018-05-15 20:43:16 It has no added fragrances, I try to use unscented products cause they’re better for your skin. But it’s natural smell is VERY light and smells  kinda like baby oil in my opinion
1488 2018-05-15 20:43:04 That crude oil price looks pretty seksy. 
1489 2018-05-15 20:43:03 I have family in the oil industry- they might know you!
1490 2018-05-15 20:43:00 I usually can’t either but i started mixing it with the Pro Filt’r and it changed my oil output after 12 hours of wear. I didn’t have to blot once.
1491 2018-05-15 20:42:40 Ive been using a mix of tea tree, lavender, and argan oil as the carrier and love it! Been like a year and my face isn’t perfect but better than it’s ever been! Although I’ve been just using lavender + argan for a few weeks and just that’s been awesome too!
1492 2018-05-15 20:42:35 I got told to take the cling film off when I got home, wash it with warm soapy water then apply coconut oil on it. Worked perfect

1503 2018-05-15 20:41:31 Oil is going up, but that just means we're going to have inflation. So, what's going to beat inflation? Bonds? Don't make me laugh. Equities are past peak and headed lower. Commodities or cryptos? My bet's on cryptos as faith in dollar sours.

Spray ground under nest area & outlying branches/trunks that snake uses!
Btw castor plants give off smells in dirt that keep many burrowing critters; ESP gophers! or creepy crawlers away!
1506 2018-05-15 20:40:50 okay transfer memories but don’t legalise cannabis oil to cure cancer and other serious illnesses

1511 2018-05-15 20:39:26 What winning streak? In last week alone he is responsible for amped up middle east stress, Iran upping nuclear program and higher oil and gas prices for North Americans. These kind of wins we don't need.
1512 2018-05-15 20:39:23 It'll be oil soon enough :)
1513 2018-05-15 20:39:11 My pain is water and oil that cant mix @BTS_twt #iVoteBTSBBMAs
1514 2018-05-15 20:39:09 how long do y’all let it ride before changing the oil when that maintenance light comes on
1515 2018-05-15 20:39:07 More oil to your head..
1516 2018-05-15 20:39:02 This is what I call "Nigerian resident privilege".... I'm here drooling on my computer, you're there doing "well, the oil is optional".

Mummy, ejo e bu ata si daada
1517 2018-05-15 20:39:01 Insanity!  They were caught with schematics on how to build a nuclear bomb. They are advancing their missile technology. The are getting billions from oil. What happens when the deal expires?  Fools.
1518 2018-05-15 20:38:55 Trump.
1519 2018-05-15 20:38:51 Have you tried it on baby oil ?
1520 2018-05-15 20:38:40 it's ok, he usually goes at 4am, so it airs out before morning... oh wait that's Trump 
1521 2018-05-15 20:38:39 You'll walk pass some girls on campus and all they'd smelling of is Condom oil.

1525 2018-05-15 20:37:57 currently getting my oil changed and my phone is still connected to the bluetooth in my car so im gonna play beans on pizza by grouplove for the workers. ur welcome for the service
1526 2018-05-15 20:37:55 In case you're wondering why it matters that a Qatari official met with Flynn and Cohen at Trump Tower, it's because Qatar was involved in sale of Rosneft, Russian oil company. Sale of Rosneft key claim of Steele Dossier -- #Trumpos get a cut in exchange for lifting sanctions.
1527 2018-05-15 20:37:54 Try jojoba oil with a couple drops of tea tree oil. Jojoba is really close in structure to natural sebum so it will stop your skin from over producing its own oil and tea tree is an anti bacteria that’s treats acne. You can get them from like TJ Maxx.
1528 2018-05-15 20:37:33 Take a spray of some sort. Dont want to upset the wife. Women hate when men destroy bathrooms. My mom yells every time I take a dump or a shower. My ex GF was worse :)
1529 2018-05-15 20:37:21 We use CBD oil from @HempWorx and have seen a huge improvement!
1530 2018-05-15 20:37:16 while you are right, it tastes okay when you douse it with olive oil and bacon
1531 2018-05-15 20:37:14 Are any of them mentioning the impacts of #peakoil on the future of transportation? Or on population for that matter. If we've only got 5 years of financially viable oil left, shouldn't that enter into the discussion?

1534 2018-05-15 20:36:42 I fucked up once and used body oil in hot climate, thought I was going to die.
1535 2018-05-15 20:36:42 RE: Gary Young of Young Living & the 'secret email' that was supposed to be for Diamond level members only and was leaked... His wife sent an email in the hours before his death telling all Diamonds that his body would be turned to oil and spread into their products. SICK!
1536 2018-05-15 20:36:40 You irritating others as well. He really is no oil painting. So pls no.
1537 2018-05-15 20:36:37 Palestine*
So u support killing millions of innocent kids,women,old people...for the past 70years just because they have OIL!!!! And they were centuries ahead now they destroyed the whole Arab world. I'm dissapointed. Unfollowed.

1541 2018-05-15 20:36:30 you can also use baby oil. never tried it but i’ve seen people make it
1542 2018-05-15 20:36:27 Love that, my favorite is, "Plus, the signature cocktails all have truffle oil in them, which is the most amazing thing you’ll ever pretend you can taste."

1547 2018-05-15 20:35:58 Let’s tell it like it is.
We need oil and believe it or not we have lots.
There should be no need the import one barrel.
STOP all the farting about.
Build more pipelines.
The technology is proven and safe.
1548 2018-05-15 20:35:57 I been using coconut oil fa bout 4 days  now an you can’t tell me ine got 4x sexier 
1549 2018-05-15 20:35:55 Big ol facts lol. I just wanted an oil change .
1550 2018-05-15 20:35:52 Analysts project that Ukraine can potentially export 2.4-2.5 million tons of sunflower oil to India by the end of MY2017/18, APK-Inform reports. In September-April MY2017/18, Ukraine shipped to India 20% more (1.7 million tons) sunflower oil than orresponding period last  season.
1551 2018-05-15 20:35:24 Hasn’t Dr. Lesser personally profited from oil & gas companies?
1552 2018-05-15 20:35:23 I mean pre-EIA analysis!
1553 2018-05-15 20:35:19 It’s a position that possesses tons of intangibles. IQ, problem solving, SHOOTING, leadership, accountability etc.. Being 6’10 and dribbling doesn’t qualify as a PG. That’s like calling me a mechanic just because I changed my oil on my car.
1554 2018-05-15 20:35:11 they got you brother, pay attention to what im telling you. in posts, get rid of the hat. scrub your head neck area, insert coconut oil into nostirals
1555 2018-05-15 20:35:10 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
1556 2018-05-15 20:35:10 When there are "experts" on both sides of an issue, you can almost always look for internal inconsistencies & deception. An article will say "98% of scientists surveyed" & then you find out it was all geologists in Alberta who work for oil companies. No expertise necessary
1557 2018-05-15 20:35:06 I miss Pedro Martinez.   There was a pitcher who was awesome and clean.
1558 2018-05-15 20:35:05 Getting dumped was pretty good for me. Ilost thirty pounds and I saved ten grand. I pet a pink flamingo and I starting getting my cars oil changed. Downside is he hurt my feelings.
1559 2018-05-15 20:34:39 Where are the condemnations from pop stars like Geldof & Bono or MPs like Theresa May & Micheal Gove when Palestinians are being shot in cold blood by brutal regime of  apartheid iSrael 

If only Palestine had an oil industry
1560 2018-05-15 20:34:35 Make sure it's pure, that's the main oil I put on my hair. I got that slave hair.
1561 2018-05-15 20:34:22 So I decided to warm up my chicken Alfredo from dinner the other night and when I got it out of the microwave it was sitting (literally the bottom of my plate was liquid butter and oil) in so much oil that I took three bites and threw it away. Now I’m sad and still hungry LOL
1562 2018-05-15 20:34:21 Regarding economy benefits:
- dividends from EDF to main owner (~82%), french State: 3.7G€/yr to 5.6 G€/yr btw 2008-16.
- read @GabrielleHecht about debates lead by workers unions in the 60-70's : non qualified miners jobs vs qual. jobs.
- trade balance: we have no oil anyway.

1575 2018-05-15 20:32:40 That’s where I was going as well. Just figured I’d throw it out there as there less than an oil change on them. I also want to bring the PSI on my turbos, So making sure both engine mounts are good probably isn’t a bad idea

1601 2018-05-15 20:29:23 Note. I have never used it on large areas of epoxy resin, i do know the osmo do their own protective under sealer, recommended for their thinner Top Oil in wet areas. Good luck.

1617 2018-05-15 20:27:52 I don’t see how you think that us making all the Arab states angry with us is going to equal us getting our hands on oil. If we were angling re oil it would have been to our benefit to leave things as is.

1619 2018-05-15 20:27:48 So I tried an olive oil hair mask. Got the olive oil out of the cabinet. That was my first mistake. I wound up pouring too much into the measuring cup.
1620 2018-05-15 20:27:39 Per TR’s chief race engineer, an oil radiator failure caused a big leak.  So the PU was changed as a precaution.

Not isolate, not something claiming to be something else. as for the manufacturer, maybe some canadian #stonerfam can help

1643 2018-05-15 20:24:56 I think the more we drill into the Earth for oil, the more unintended consequences we’ll find out about. Much like taking oil out of a car. Maybe oil lubricates the planet and taking it away will eventually mess something up... Like bad
1644 2018-05-15 20:24:50 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.
1645 2018-05-15 20:24:46 $GENE why are we showing a 75% loss on initial investment on market launch. and thats with the 50% bonus included. my investment is worth 1/4 of  what i invested. and why so many millions of coins added since ico closed #GENE
1646 2018-05-15 20:24:46 Yeah. Runs off auxiliary batteries and starts the truck when the voltage drops below a certain threshold. Ours also starts when the oil temp drops below a certain temp.
1647 2018-05-15 20:24:34 Kashmir we will handle, not u but ur entire generation and coming ones will be wiped not only from Earth but even from ur Jannat. For Palestine I can just feel petty, big Fish using their sentiments, u all will die soon,  once let the Crude Oil in Middle East get over.
1648 2018-05-15 20:24:33 scrub your head with palmolive dish soap with the LACTOSE ACID in it. use a scrubby, if it doesnt hurt, scrub harder. scrub the transmitting gel off you scalp, noticed u havent sneezed in awhile? its up nostrils too. coconut oil. snort it, IT WORKS,  dont stop
1649 2018-05-15 20:24:16 As Venezuelans suffer, Maduro buys foreign oil to subsidize Cuba...

1654 2018-05-15 20:24:02 My sentiments exactly lol.. Like walking through a moving oil painting.
1655 2018-05-15 20:23:47 Ahh. Memories. Chilli flake oil froyo was too 2015 for them
1656 2018-05-15 20:23:45 Agree with second part. But russia exactly the same just more oil money. And you choose kerch bridge as example because you are trol. As it is example of corruption and over pricing
1657 2018-05-15 20:23:44 Nation is Swimming in Oil and Natural Gas; and, ole' Charlie still wants to use precious food to gas up his SUV'S and Tractors.  Or not! Maybe trying to please the Greedy Farmers.  Makes no sense.
1658 2018-05-15 20:23:18 Well there is also the fact that grains such as rice and wheat go exclusively to humans (roughage may be sent for ruminants). And that every single soybean is separated into oil (for human feed and industry) and meal (for mostly pig and chicken feed).
1659 2018-05-15 20:23:05 De nada gran aceite!
1660 2018-05-15 20:22:25 me: *uses coconut oil on body skin*

1662 2018-05-15 20:22:15 I'm finding w/ my son diet is really important. He eats little processed foods. No sugar except in fresh fruit. Takes a quality probiotic. And we are using cbd oil. All things I think are worth checking out. The #gutbrain connection is real and not nearly addressed by drs enough
1663 2018-05-15 20:22:11 why r ppl acting like rihanna invented sparkly body oil
1664 2018-05-15 20:22:05 The Saudis are wanting higher oil prices, because they're going bankrupt. The globalist parasites want to privatise water. The costs of fracking now financially acceptable, because of it. It's a mess and the communities involvesmd look on like sheep.

1667 2018-05-15 20:21:55 Retweeted Jackson Ude (@jacksonpbn):

Barely 9months to elections, Buhari has awarded oil contracts to 50 companies, most owned by his cronies. And guess what, Casiva Limited, which used to supply beddings and furnitures to NEMA, owned by Nasir Dano, a Buhari front, also got!
1668 2018-05-15 20:21:46 I mix my own paint with pigment and linseed oil. Blue pigment is very expensive.
1669 2018-05-15 20:21:31 Just wondering: When you think of those "globalists" who control 90%, are you talking Conservatives, Liberals and Fascists, or Capitalists, Comunists and Socialists, or the Jewish elite that supposedly controls everything? Arabs who control oil supplies and want to impose Islam?
1670 2018-05-15 20:21:02 Ok. The towels on the floor. $300.00. You. Me. A bottle of oil.
1671 2018-05-15 20:20:59 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
If we are to become ready for a renewable world, we should stop the Tarsands destruction NOW.
1672 2018-05-15 20:20:42 im gonna do a oil treatment on my hair ok bye
1673 2018-05-15 20:20:30 Israel won't strike "anywhere they please". It strikes strategic Hamas posts, usually places that were used to fire rockets into Israeli soil.
Also what about the kites Hamas has been flying into Israel with bottles of oil and fire?

1677 2018-05-15 20:19:56 The pipeline is only good for the foreign oil company.
1678 2018-05-15 20:19:48 Housing market could pressure domestic growth for sure. But shouldn't confuse the Canadian economy with the stock market. The Canadian stock market is heavily tied to the global economy via mining and oil. A perky oil market can help banks weather a housing storm.

1680 2018-05-15 20:19:46 *Wow... Is Someone Suggesting the Multinational Oil and Gas Corporations Have “NO SAY” in prices at the pump? Really? And Reduced Barrels of Oil from Iran due to Donald J Trump’s dance with World Politics has “NO IMPACT” on gas prices? Really? #BeReal

1682 2018-05-15 20:19:32 Amin
1683 2018-05-15 20:19:21 So it’s the magnitude of the deficit that’s the issue? Or the proportion of revenues coming from oil being higher? Or both combined?
1684 2018-05-15 20:19:20 Well,  gasoline hit $3.09 here in mid-Michigan today. That's $1.00 increase in less than 6 months. 
Thanks @realDonaldTrump for your making life better for Americans! 
Actually, we know you're in bed with the Saudis & U.S. oil tycoons. You're crooked. 
RESIGN. NOW!!!

1695 2018-05-15 20:18:10 Last night’s #BrownsLastChance speeches and panel discussion in Oakland had many important themes, not the least of which was that in order to fight the continued negative impacts of extractive oil & gas industry, we must use people power. #KeepItInTheGround

That kind of behavior is colonized af, but I have no idea how to fix it.

1701 2018-05-15 20:17:34 In all fairness, me and cooking is basically oil to water.
1702 2018-05-15 20:17:33 Does anyone know which essential oil is safe and not safe to use in your diffuser around cats ?? I’m getting mixed information on the internet.
1703 2018-05-15 20:16:51 Even if a barrel of oil cost $1000 Muhammadu Buhari will blame Nigeria for having more than 150 million citizens for his failures 

Oil price will never supplant incompetence
1704 2018-05-15 20:16:48 Look forward to feedback.  Had a speaker at our BID AGM who slated city centre nightclubs. So bringing fun, dancing AND retail spend is a good counter argument.
1705 2018-05-15 20:16:47 You're not being fair. The government also gives billions to the poor oil companies that are struggling with just a few billion in profits. Then they cover up all the spills where people, animals, and whole ecosystems are poisoned.

1707 2018-05-15 20:16:13 Robert, want to unplug the Arabs?  How?  Solve the energy problem.  80-95% of the oil gone, which means no Arab oil needed.  Bankrupt.  No money for Mosques, let alone terrorists.  My engine can do that.  Help me find right people to get it done.  seaplaneguy@msn.com
1708 2018-05-15 20:15:58 I'd also say that checking levels is important. The number of people who don't know how to check oil is astonishing.

1712 2018-05-15 20:15:34 My mother was brilliant, funny and a painter. Her oil portraits, are simply amazing. She died when Stephen Ross and I were only 15. She never saw me receive my first doctorate.  I always wonder, would she approve my decision to become a special agent with the FBI?

BTW you know that all major banks in the world are no longer financing oil sand projects and other dirty extraction of oil. So why would the tax payer pay?
1723 2018-05-15 20:14:31 I read about birds preening each other and instantly had to think about wing!Kylux again and how Hux's oil gland either doesn't produce enough or is too sensitive to touch so Kylo uses his own to make Hux's wings shiny, lmao 
(idk if that's erotic, I just think it's hella cute)
1724 2018-05-15 20:14:28 found some oil in the Lifehold Core. I think I'll gift it to Nagi.
1725 2018-05-15 20:14:26 I’m sorry but whoever tweeted that baby oil is a god sent for taking tan off is a big fat liar because all it did for me was make me feel uncomfortable for 40minutes

1732 2018-05-15 20:13:34 An oddity; As the dollar gets stronger oil indices drop. Fuel prices are traditionally lower.
So, is oil being artificially inflated ??? YES
1733 2018-05-15 20:13:32 Lots of people are super supportive all over, but watch out for the posers and snake oil sales(wo)men. I like reddit for inspiration: r/fitness and r/xxfitness!
1734 2018-05-15 20:13:22 if you think the wars for oil were bloody, wait until there's no water
1735 2018-05-15 20:13:20 Anyone with a modicum of sense knows that the Poch to Chavs rumours are bollocks.

1736 2018-05-15 20:13:18 .@realDonaldTrump .@DonaldJTrumpJr .@IvankaTrump .@EricTrump how can oil now be $71 a barrel $3.70 a gallon and we own the energy Market?!  @SecretaryPerry @VP @ENERGY who’s getter no paid off?

1741 2018-05-15 20:12:10 Everyone knows Erdogan can't be trusted, he shot down a Russian plane in retaliation for hitting his illegal oil convoy delivering oil to ISIS. Money and Muslim control of the world is all that loser cares about
1742 2018-05-15 20:12:04 I used 80/20 engine oil/ ep90 in the 80's on a few commuter bikes I owned as it was free when I worked in a Garage, quite messy. I neveer used chainsaw oil as thats like sticky treacle. I now only use the proper Scottoil

1748 2018-05-15 20:11:39 We are all victims of this invasion, some worse, some still to come. The perpetrators are predicted in the Bible as, "the wicked in high places".

1764 2018-05-15 20:10:02 equating indegenous ways of life with cavemen is a bigoted act. Not sure what other conclusion to make.

Also acting like you're ~for the environment~ and then trashing indigenous cultures as inferior to your oil/slave-labor dependent 1st world culture is just silly.
1765 2018-05-15 20:09:59 Perhaps because news media pushes the progressive line and Israel is pushing a rightist, nationalistic and ethnocentric policy? Also known as MIGA, rather than MAGA.
1766 2018-05-15 20:09:57 oil cleansing ftw 
1767 2018-05-15 20:09:56 Really good information from @TheDelticGroup to champion the late night sector. Thank you.  So important
1768 2018-05-15 20:09:36 It is only a bad workman that complains about his tool. Crude oil is close to $80. Do you have steady electricity? Are food prices down? Has the dollar dropped? Aren't they still paying subsidy after lying to us about its removal?? Are hospitals not dilapidated? Please!
1769 2018-05-15 20:09:30 i use coconut oil!! and i usually just order everything on amazon

1773 2018-05-15 20:08:54 So much sweat. And baby oil
1774 2018-05-15 20:08:52 So this isn't just about gasoline.  It is in the US' national interest to spend less on fuel imports and have a stable world order.  It is in [Large Asian Country Name Redacted]'s national interest to increase oil prices and destabilize the post-WWII consensus.
1775 2018-05-15 20:08:52 You and I are like oil and water.
1776 2018-05-15 20:08:45 Things that guy in the oil movie could have said besides "I drink your milkshake":

- I chug your sweet crude
- I huff your petrol
- I drown in your tar sands
- I Can't Believe It's Not Kerosene!™
- I go blind from all the gasoline I consume
1777 2018-05-15 20:08:33 100% Pure Jamaican Black Castor Oil
1778 2018-05-15 20:08:30 I cringed as she poured that gallon of oil into the bread.
1779 2018-05-15 20:08:26 We should examine the water tables juxtaposed with oil/gas deposits. I bet there is a correlation between them.
1780 2018-05-15 20:08:15 Isn’t that Jackie Chan’s boss in Rush Hour?
1781 2018-05-15 20:08:14 CBCs headline for this article was horrible. It should have read “Tick repellent made from highly concentrated oil’s works for 10 minutes 80% of the time.”
1782 2018-05-15 20:08:13 Could be looking at $100 oil in next 12 months
1783 2018-05-15 20:08:06 PEOPLE WITH OILY SKIN SHOULD SKIP MOISTERISER
This is completely wrong, no matter your skin type, moisturiser should always be a part of your daily skincare routine because if you don't wear it, your skin can be producing unnecessary oil.
1784 2018-05-15 20:08:01 Great points. My thoughts: Bolton & BiBi both want war with Iran. BiBi & Trump* both under intense investigation for crimes. Trump* helps BiBi by moving embassy, BiBi helped Trump* with Black Cube & WMD style presser. Putin makes $$$$ as oil prices skyrocket...
1785 2018-05-15 20:07:59 Pro driver don't like being boiled in oil
1786 2018-05-15 20:07:55 Good old oil of cloves to the rescue
1787 2018-05-15 20:07:54 It is a Prof and attestation that your government failed, you stole our treasury, You should be ashamed of yourself. Our barrel of crud oil was sold $45 per barrel under Jonathan ADM.while it has rise to $77 per barrel.@renoomokri your government is full of cabals..
1788 2018-05-15 20:07:50 We paid $1.50 when oil was last at $150 a barrel. It's at $70 today. So blame others all you want but this is EVIDENCE of all the hands in the cookie jar. Maybe do some research next time before replying
1789 2018-05-15 20:07:28 Better off,@SenSchumer. My Fed tax bill went up $2k (estimated for 2018), but worth it to shut down illegal immigrants, grow the economy,  and kick a** on U.S. enemies. We are safer now, we have our own oil, and plenty of jobs.  Drain the swamp.
1790 2018-05-15 20:07:26 Stop throwing video cameras into frying oil.  It ruins the camera and makes the oil taste bad.
1791 2018-05-15 20:07:19 But you can buy direct from Iran. 
I still like my Texas oil tho.

1796 2018-05-15 20:06:44 #EDU2018 @LuqNiazi @ibm global leader of oil & gas says Calgary is leading the world on energy disruption using technology like #Watson
1797 2018-05-15 20:06:40 The message is that we need to control the oil in the Middle East. We have to work with our allies, which aren’t democracies. #1 is Saudi Arabia. It is the #1 radical religious dictatorship in the Middle East. It is the buyer of our arms and weapons. Israel is involved in the oil
1798 2018-05-15 20:06:38 I get tired of these experience “museums” and installations for the sake of the gram. I said to a friend, sometimes I just want to look at a fucking oil painting. She said “You know... I really never understood that shit.” Wait wat? Don’t understand oil paintings?
1799 2018-05-15 20:06:34 No oil money/jobs or produce or money from it then or tourism.  oh and you won’t we wanting to fish in our waters then either right??  and you can pay for all those renovations to Westminster etc and keep the royal spongers yourselves deal?? And take back trident too!!
1800 2018-05-15 20:06:22 The political tension in the middle east is pushing oil to around $80. Nigeria is going to gain from this windfall, but can the government of the day do something meaningful rather than squander it away like we have had since oil was discovered in Nigeria?
1801 2018-05-15 20:06:03 Exclusive: As Venezuelans suffer, Maduro buys foreign oil to subsidize Cuba: HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela's state-run oil firm PDVSA has bought nearly $440 million worth of foreign crude and shipped it directly to Cuba on friendly credit terms - and often at a loss, according…

1807 2018-05-15 20:05:28 Been asked before but timing never quite right. Let's see.
1808 2018-05-15 20:05:25 If it’s just dilbit you’re worried about, and the scientists at NRCan suggest it behaves like crude, I’ll assume you are a fan of increased production in Texas, Nigeria, the Middle East, etc. to offset oilsands production. Paraphrased, you just agreed that other oil is fine.
1809 2018-05-15 20:05:24 Oil pulling.. tell me your experience...
1810 2018-05-15 20:05:21 I use the beard oil when I leave the gym it's hella nice.

1814 2018-05-15 20:05:00 Another #StLouisRiverQuest tip for the students: Don’t put anything down the storm sewers.  They’re not for trash or used car oil!  If they overflow after a heavy rain the contaminants will flow directly into an area lake or river.
1815 2018-05-15 20:04:38 Collusion! You work for Russia China Koreans and oil barrons. You are a communist. A national embarrassment. What goes up, must come down.
1816 2018-05-15 20:04:14 Fun Hitler fact:  Hitler did not attack Russia on a broad front, A pincer was aimed at Volgagrad, to secure the rich oil fields of the Caucases. There as no broad Russian front as Tv would lead you to believe,  not defeated by the USSR but by the "Weather" just say'n .

1825 2018-05-15 20:03:28 That's nonsense. They acting like you got a whole day to kill just for an oil change lol
1826 2018-05-15 20:03:26 Trudeau's desire to phase out Western Canadian Oil comes at the same time as Newfoundland and Nova Scotia and Quebec are actively ramping up their offshore oil production and LNG production. This is such egregious behavior on the part of the Prime Minister.

1835 2018-05-15 20:02:40 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. 

Yet they are starving due to their socialism. 

BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
1836 2018-05-15 20:02:29 They just authorized the money and not a peep was mentioned. 

Both parties are bought by the military industrial complex, Big Pharma, and Big Oil.

Bernie has a plan.  I’m sorry you choose not see it or listen to it.
1837 2018-05-15 20:02:25 tRUMP and cabal all got Rosneft stock and big $ after the so-called sale of the company last year.

I'm not nervous @ all. 

I know that the tax cut ballooned the deficit, oil prices are rising and that overall, the middle class, unless they seize on the idea no brown people are allowed in will not be happy when all is said and done.
1850 2018-05-15 20:01:04 Palm oil business.
1851 2018-05-15 20:01:04 Checking your oil is very important, but there are other fluids you should check too.  Don't forget your transmission fluid, your coolant & brake and power steering fluids, keeping an eye on them could save time & money down the road.

1863 2018-05-15 19:59:48 Did the 10 year treasury at 3.05%?stomp out this rally alone? Increase interest rates and the cost of oil going up might be enough headwinds to Keep us trading horizontally through the summer?
1864 2018-05-15 19:59:47 Keep them mad at mysterious enemies who would never affect their lives with one hand. Sell them comfort snake oil with the other. All while your army of corporate allies drain them of resources and opportunities.

1869 2018-05-15 19:59:17 You just need 2 drops and dilute it with a carrier oil like olive or grapeseed because it’s very potent. Place 2 drops under the tongue and spit out or you can take it with juice or water

1877 2018-05-15 19:58:01 Ahhh that's the worst!! I'm allergic to all shellfish and melons, so I feel you. I'd invest in avocado mayo to mix with tuna (mustard is also compliant)! A healthy drizzle of olive oil/more avocado + more protein will help fill you up. (2-3 eggs = 12-18g protein).
1878 2018-05-15 19:57:59 And the vague hint of patchouli oil, weed and urine.

1887 2018-05-15 19:56:39 Grab a few toilet seat covers to cut up into 2-inch squares. These are great for soaking up excess oil on your face.
1888 2018-05-15 19:56:13 No one has taken away our fish & chips granted but now they have to be cooked in sunflower oil instead of beef dripping & they aren't allowed to use newspaper anymore in case the print comes off.
I know it's a cliché but they honesty tasted better out of newspaper.
1889 2018-05-15 19:56:10 Ah yes, those glorious days on the oil rigs, what fun we had. And such understanding workmates! Just a dim and distant memory now.
1890 2018-05-15 19:56:05 So you think this country is only relying on oil now? Wake up bro things have happened, there are sources capable of paying back now
1891 2018-05-15 19:55:56 Yep, that would work. Dress with a little oil, sesame seeds and citrus juice of some sort.
1892 2018-05-15 19:55:40 Possibly in the future
1893 2018-05-15 19:55:37 in flowchart note “Israel lobby” uniquely has only outgoing arrows, i.e. don’t accept incoming from anyone (and “oil and armaments lobby” a subsidiary of Israel lobby, although arrow lacking).

“social media + human rights activists” are classic knee-grabbing hookers.
1894 2018-05-15 19:55:29 Scotland will thrive as a normal independent nation -and you name European countries and New Zealand.

Uruguay has been independent for two centuries, pity it doesn't have Oil, Gas or Coal, so very poor.

1897 2018-05-15 19:55:17 Coconut oil isn’t the best for your hair unless you are washing it out right after. People cook with coconut oil, why put it on your hair to damage it while you use hot tools 
1898 2018-05-15 19:55:14 Have you tried greasing the metal pole with oil? I’ve heard that it works.
1899 2018-05-15 19:55:11 Healtcare Authority is crumbling because our state did not expand Medicaid. OKHCA is also underfunded by the legislators at the STATE Capitol because they will not raise GPT on oil/gas. Illegal aliens in Oklahoma are not eligible for benefits except for emergency services.

1900 2018-05-15 19:54:36 They should have invested in new Technology a long time ago. We should not have to keep our oil prices high so Canada can be competitive.
1901 2018-05-15 19:54:18 Watch NK share their nuke tech with Iran in exchange for oil, now that Trump gave Iran an excuse to resume production.
1902 2018-05-15 19:54:18 CBD oil. Taken internally and rubbed on your temples and between your eyes. Beats them all.
1903 2018-05-15 19:53:55 Nope. Getting an oil change
1904 2018-05-15 19:53:53 They can’t admit they f..d up. Not even the decency to hear the other side. Like little children. But the US does no wrong. Everything they touch in the Middle East they screw up. Just get out Oh wait they can’t until they get Iran’s oil. Let’s see the Arab states next move?
1905 2018-05-15 19:53:52 Also I only came for a oil change and ended up with some more shit done on my car so there goes $300 out of my pocket GREAT. Need me a sugar zaddy ASAP

1910 2018-05-15 19:53:20 Do you know White peoples took credit from Smart people we call Nerds too. Do anything in USA is really American idea. Hmmm I don't think so. USA only have oil and weapons. Nothing else can claiming you did anything without help.
1911 2018-05-15 19:52:46 Is it you that comform with this?
1912 2018-05-15 19:52:43 Ok. Boil ur fish, meat nd other condiments until they r soft (add maggi, pepper n salt according to the quantity) add palm oil, leave to boil for a while,  den put ur already sliced okro and leave to boil for 5mins. Ur soup is ready sir

1914 2018-05-15 19:51:44 Very hot pan, little bit of vegetable oil, but that's pretty much it. It's also a good idea to season generously with salt beforehand (which both seasons and helps to draw out some moisture), and to pat the meat dry with paper towels right before it goes in the pan
1915 2018-05-15 19:51:44 Yeah,they never touch world politics, no role on oil prices and the market.Oil sold to china is also in usd.Yes yes all trouble is about social politics.

1940 2018-05-15 19:50:04 Gas cost more and so do all the goods made from petro! Money in one hand and then the oil companies have grabbed the little tax cut you voted for. Next year we get less and then each year after. How about a new tall tale!

1942 2018-05-15 19:49:57 Now you need to release our oil reserves and get these prices under control. If not you are going to send us into a recession.

2040 2018-05-15 19:38:21 Aunt Bongi and isiZulu amanzi ne oil #TheQueen
2041 2018-05-15 19:38:19 The flyers deff are NOT the next oilers, I agree fully on good FA signings the oil didn’t ever draft need just top end offense that didn’t mesh well and neglected too draft D and Goaltenders for many years... Flyers have a great prospect pool because they have talent everywhere
2042 2018-05-15 19:38:19 And the unemployment is still the highest one in Europe  a country with natural resources, oil and minerals, agriculture and tourism and still people have no money to put on the table for their families.. Bravo #PMRama
2043 2018-05-15 19:38:14 If I am sick enough to be in an ambulance... then you can keep your liquid Tylenol and Lavender Oil... I want the real stuff! “Oh... I see you have a compound fracture after falling from that 2nd story... here’s some Tylenol for your pain... and some Rose oil for the Shock..”
2044 2018-05-15 19:38:04 There’s not a difference tbh . These questions are for practicality . When you see 2500 ppl . The last thing you want to do is fry something in veggie oil that you could’ve done the first time
2045 2018-05-15 19:37:57 I'm telling you, man. Thieve's oil. Take a swig of that stuff and you're good to go. Burns like hell, helps a lot.
2046 2018-05-15 19:37:38 I'm sitting at the mechanic while my car gets an oil change and this girl just got up and changed the TV channel from the local news to something else. I didn't know you were allowed to do that and I'm ashamed I never even thought of it. The remote is sitting right there!
2047 2018-05-15 19:37:38 Anbesol the oil is the best hands down
2048 2018-05-15 19:37:36 Oil price is almost $80. 
More money to their pockets.
2049 2018-05-15 19:37:27 Continually amazed at how much it costs to fix oil leaks from a van engine.
2050 2018-05-15 19:37:07 Maybe a Battle. But will lose the War. Just like the Socialists of Venezuela. Needed to get the Big Bad Oil Companies and spread the wealth to the poor.They ended up spreading despair. Now there is only Poor.The Rich left. They can do that.
2051 2018-05-15 19:37:05 1911 - The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil Company, ruling it was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

2053 2018-05-15 19:36:21 A true Yorkshire pudding is made with beef drippings, from the roast, not with oil. And doesn’t have sugar in it, as that Dutch Baby recipe does. I make both. Similar, but not the same.
2054 2018-05-15 19:36:13 Coconut oil  apparently 
2055 2018-05-15 19:36:07 This man really had a thong hanging from his rear view mirror lmao

Sir... go get your oil changed somewhere else. Please don’t come back 
2056 2018-05-15 19:36:04 I like using witch hazel to clean my face then coconut oil to moisturize, this is just for the days that I don't want to use face wash.
2057 2018-05-15 19:36:01 @SadiqKhan you are a snake oil merchant
2058 2018-05-15 19:35:46 My biggest problem with your advertising Natural Hemp Oil was that you didn't give a referral link that would indicate that you were the reason I hypothetically bought some (legal CYA). I thought it only came from pot until you, and I'd been wanting to try CBD for anxiety. Thanks
2059 2018-05-15 19:35:34 Went to go get my oil changed..
Ended up spending 200 dollars on my car. 

But hey, got a free car wash and vacuum cleaning 
2060 2018-05-15 19:35:28 What led the move? Data was alright! Technical triggers? However, if oil was the only major catalyst then steepening makes sense - coz Fed looks through high oil prices, so fronts don't sell much, whereas 10s/30s do, since they are affected by gen price level. Thoughts?
2061 2018-05-15 19:35:20 A true Yorkshire pudding is made with beef drippings, from the roast, not with oil. And doesn’t have sugar in it, as that Dutch Baby recipe does. I make both. Similar, but not the same.
2062 2018-05-15 19:35:09 When did oil changes start being $60?
2063 2018-05-15 19:34:57 OP was contrasting the similar-size populations Gaza and Singapore, neither of which has oil or significant guest worker populations, and the OP of this branch of the thread tried to compare to UAE.  The comparison is preposterous.
2064 2018-05-15 19:34:47 Uncertainty over the government formation in #Karnataka, along with high global crude oil prices and consistent outflow of foreign funds from the domestic #equity market weakened the Indian #Rupee to a 15-month low on Tuesday. | #KarnatakaElectionResults2018 RT@BengalNewzIndia

2068 2018-05-15 19:34:27 I smell like banana boat tanning oil and I can feel my skin sizzling. Hopefully I get bronze and don’t look like a lobster
2069 2018-05-15 19:34:12 What are we, a supposedly intelligent species doing? #Plastic killing the oceans, #orangutans being wiped out for palm oil and now #Pangolins killed for their scales. We really need to get a grip.
2070 2018-05-15 19:34:05 Forgot the rupee which is past 68 now? Oil coming around 80 will be nightmare
2071 2018-05-15 19:33:56 Thanks to yahoo boys bringing in the much needed dollars when the oil prices were declining
2072 2018-05-15 19:33:35 Due to contamination of the tank from the April 21st oil drop off day at Public Works, oil & battery drop off for this Saturday, May 19, has been CANCELLED.  We will resume drop off on Saturday, June 16, from 9 am - 1 pm. #EnfieldCT
2073 2018-05-15 19:33:34 So that you know , oregano oil also kills cancer topically . It will burn a hole in you if you use too much . I applied it with a toothpick . Takes about 5 days to drop a growth off . Nasty the thought ,  but very effective .. Essential oils info is available on it .
2074 2018-05-15 19:33:34 These were portable gold candlesticks that held small oil lamps. Each candlestick represented a church through which the light of life shone. Throughout Scripture seven is the number of completeness, so these seven candlesticks represent all the churches. )
2075 2018-05-15 19:33:33 Where is Nmadi Kanu ?
2076 2018-05-15 19:33:21 Another in a series of articles that seeks to tax electric vehicles with the air pollution generated by electricity production and magically forgets to consider the air and water pollution generated by oil extraction, refining and transport.
2077 2018-05-15 19:33:19 Stop lying. Imperialist hate Syria because the government dropped the US petrodollar, the greater Israel project and wanting to run an oil pipe line through Syria.
2078 2018-05-15 19:33:11 Why not just do veggie oil for both ?
2079 2018-05-15 19:33:07 Petroleum reserve piecemeal to fund other budget priorities is a big problem. A disruption in world oil prices will still cause pump prices to go up here even if we don’t import ANY oil. Which we still do. Good on the jobs created, but not astronomical. Don’t forget those stock
2080 2018-05-15 19:33:06 I’ve spent a bit of money on new ink ribbons for all of my machines. They use a special oil based ink that doesn’t evaporate very fast at all until its on paper. I wish I could still get cotton or silk ribbons though. Everything is nylon now...
2081 2018-05-15 19:32:57 Try just herbs pre wash hair an scalp oil!
2082 2018-05-15 19:32:50 holy hot chili oil

2084 2018-05-15 19:32:35 y'all never had castor oil? wait
2085 2018-05-15 19:32:29 OMG! Are you kidding me? Holy Shit! How much is enough? It’s never enough! That’s the Repucklins for you selling  oil
2086 2018-05-15 19:32:25 Yes you’re going in the right direction. Look up Dr Sebi. Get some black seed oil and take it daily. Drink natural spring water as well. Glad the universe is sending you signs
2087 2018-05-15 19:32:20 Oil changes are cool & all until they come back tellin you there’s 37 things wrong with your car

2091 2018-05-15 19:31:42 I LOVE the deodorants from The Dirty Goat. I've also just started using one that has charcoal and coconut oil in it. I can't remember the name of it, though...I found it at Whole Foods.

2093 2018-05-15 19:31:18 Imagine! I need anointing oil
2094 2018-05-15 19:31:16 Vegetable oil for those clients with allergies ....
2095 2018-05-15 19:31:13 You have the need, the need for speed!
2096 2018-05-15 19:31:08 Kind of like oil and water being compatible.
2097 2018-05-15 19:31:00 Canada’s marine oil spill response model needs a complete revamp, with the respective roles of the ROs and the @CoastGuardCAN clarified, and the latter’s commitment in terms of response vessels, equipment, personnel and training substantially upgraded.

2099 2018-05-15 19:30:49 Worth a giggle. But we had a product called Nothin' But Nut Coconut Oil. 
2100 2018-05-15 19:30:40 I told my dad I was gonna change my own oil... he laughed and told me to make an appointment. Alright
2101 2018-05-15 19:30:37 Oh, youre arguing with the wrong guy...break even point now on shale is $50/barrel. High oil prices help US oil companies. 2019 is gonna be a good year for gas prices.

2105 2018-05-15 19:30:06 This guy doesn’t know what he is talking about. I just went to Hollywood Feed and bought to bags of CBD Oil treat for my dog to help with his joints because he is old. The world is not black and white. You can’t just stamp a label on everything as bad or good.
2106 2018-05-15 19:30:03 Today I saw a man who makes 4x as much as me put bar oil in a gas tank.
2107 2018-05-15 19:29:59 She just added a highlighter to body oil, you could probably substitute Palmers body oil for this one and add a highlighter of your choice 
2108 2018-05-15 19:29:50 I just put on coconut oil . I know once I step outside I’m gonna be toast - literally 
2109 2018-05-15 19:29:13 I’m getting my oil changed. They just called my name. I shushed them. Why, you ask? Because I was genuinely in the middle of a @QueenLesli YouTube video. Theses poor people still think #MeganandHarry are royals. Please have several seats and hail THE queen.
2110 2018-05-15 19:28:52 Less cars, 
More eBikes!
Stick it to the oil companies!
2111 2018-05-15 19:28:52 Applying a tiny amount of oil should free critters trapped on sticky stuff, ants need other ants though I would probably just let it go nearby and hope it can find home :<
2112 2018-05-15 19:28:42 Honestly, the first time I saw the oil (tar) sands, I was horrified. Never seen something so horrible in the environment. And it was Canada.
2113 2018-05-15 19:28:37 OH is revitalising the garden table and chairs. They'll look good once they're dry- sadly the teak oil is now an #asthma trigger. :(
2114 2018-05-15 19:28:21 “The last barrel of oil...” I’m guessing that last barrel won’t be worth much money. Why bother trying to build a business around the last barrel of oil? Isn’t the best return to shareholders to build a business around the thing that will displace that oil? #EDU2018 #EFLab
2115 2018-05-15 19:27:54 You are exactly right. The news says oil is going up and you walk out the door 5 min later and the price of gas has gone up.
2116 2018-05-15 19:27:46 I am on PS4 and also when I click an opposition it switches to another for example when I choose oil of empires it switches to iron walls
2117 2018-05-15 19:27:43 #edu2018 will nuclear have a presence in the oil sands.
2118 2018-05-15 19:27:42 Not Like when we helped Saddam gas Iranians. Not Like when we helped topple a Democratic Gvt in Iran to steal their oil wealth. Not Like when we created the Taliban and when we invaded Iraq and destroyed their security forces. With a straight face, though
2119 2018-05-15 19:27:38 Ok so on the one hand we have Big Oil.  On the other we have.

Big wind 
Big solar
Politicians - ability to virtue signal and raise taxes.
Banks - eg GS have invested massively in carbon trading 
Environmentalists- more donations and support

2120 2018-05-15 19:26:51 Have you tried the orange ones - I think it must be the citrus oil;they whip down like greased lightening
2121 2018-05-15 19:26:49 Any decent cook knows a bonafide Yorkshire pudding is made with beef drippings, not with oil. And doesn’t have sugar in it, as that recipe does. That’s indeed a Dutch Baby pancake.
2122 2018-05-15 19:26:09 ..well Dotard, your stupid action of moving the Isreal embassy has now assured continued violence in the Middle East.  No Nobel Peace prize now, you have only helped Putin jack up oil prices.

2139 2018-05-15 19:25:10 buy oil stocks and thank the ayatollah for causing the prices to rise beyond reasonable LOL
2140 2018-05-15 19:25:04 This is a biased and bad analysis. A good analysis presents all sides. No mention of govt subsidies for oil & gas (intangible drilling deduction, etc.). No mention of many reports showing without subsidies renewables are lower cost than coal, nukes.

2143 2018-05-15 19:24:43 @RachelSlade1 #intotheragingsea this book is a hard read...Should be required reading for every merchant marine deck officer. Blessed I work for an oil major that doesn’t apply commercial pressure. Tragic and upsetting the choices made.

2159 2018-05-15 19:23:06 The story is different when it comes to Oil, OGRA rules apply there. But when it comes to commodities like coal, gypsum and other commodities you can easily transfer at 80 tons. The other reason the freights of oil are very high but thats not the case in other commodities.
2160 2018-05-15 19:22:42 Burning the midnight oil?

2165 2018-05-15 19:21:42 A great study in populism. When he took power Louisiana was as poor as many South American countries. He trashed democratic and financial norms, and took on the oil companies, amongst others.

2176 2018-05-15 19:20:43 Mix 2-3 drops with olive or cooking oil and apply the mixture on the sore tooth. Dab a cotton ball in the oil mixture and rub it on the affected area. Fill a Ziploc bag w/ ice, wrap a cloth around it, and hold it over your cheek where it hurts. The cold temperature will numb it.
2177 2018-05-15 19:20:34 Just sliced with a glug of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, crack of salt and sprinkle or fresh basil. With or without ripped mozzarella. Mm smells like summer
2178 2018-05-15 19:20:31 Every single warning light in my uber drivers car is currently on. I’m talking check engine, low oil, tire pressure, the works. I wonder if I’ll get a free ride or something when his 2009 Mitsubishi explodes
2179 2018-05-15 19:20:28 The oil and gas industry is rapidly changing though.
In the next couple of years almost everything will be automated to cut cost for operators and service companies.

Your skills might get outdated if they are not bolstered by relevancy.

2182 2018-05-15 19:20:25 Those Scots billionaires: G Gordon (whisky), M al-Fayed (!), M al-Tajir (oil, property), Mohn (manufacturing), I Wood (oil), Thomsons (publishing), P Day (retail), J Shaw (pharma), A Clark (cars), J McColl (‘streamlining’), Souters (buses), Mellon (property), Laidlaw (publishing)
2183 2018-05-15 19:20:24 10,000 barrels left?  Current production is 1.63m boe per day - that means we only have 10 mins left of oil   I look forward to the news at 9pm telling us there's no more North Sea oil (luckily current estimates are 11.7bn boe - that'll last until 2050)
2184 2018-05-15 19:20:19 Just used a Wooster 6.5" mohair blend mini roller for oil based satin and am very pleased with it on doors. Curious what other people use on doors regular short pile, microfiber or some kind of mini roller?

2192 2018-05-15 19:19:52 If that is the case why is your President dancing with the Saudi Princes? Purely because they have oil, and zillions invested in the US. The proponents of the most radical form of Islam live in Saudi Arabia, and yet they are your valuable friend. Idealism when it suits you?
2193 2018-05-15 19:19:45 Oil change, then I’m on the road
2194 2018-05-15 19:19:32 We're trying CBD oil for pets. We'll see how it goes. Any other suggestions on how to help my dog? Hes got poly arthritis. Idk what it is but I know hes in pain :(
2195 2018-05-15 19:19:32 Honestly, my only question about this sign is "why is there a radio tower/oil rig on it?"

2203 2018-05-15 19:18:32 I don't about Sindh but someone who deals with carriage comp, I know how strict motorway is, when we purchase Furnace oil, the volume changes due to change in temperature and hence the weight.

2206 2018-05-15 19:18:08 I got a split scoop of the Coava coffee and the Arbequina olive oil! Coava because I quickly became a fan of their coffee and I wanted something Portland-specific, but the olive oil was the real star to me.

2212 2018-05-15 19:17:40 Make CBD oil (the Real kind) that doesn’t make you high - Widely Available OTC.  I’d be the first to try it!!!
2213 2018-05-15 19:17:34 Well not only is it not entirely true (we have increase production) but the main point is that consumers are paying it back into big oil's pockets, while oil rich regimes benefit from increase crude prices.
2214 2018-05-15 19:17:31 Gotta get some shimmer oil for the summer because glow is in and suns out BUNS OUT

2236 2018-05-15 19:15:11 So if, under international maritime law, the oil is in waters belonging to Scotland yet you say it's not Scotland's? Does that mean the gas fields off Lowestoft, in England's national waters, are not England's? Could the Dutch maybe have a claim on them?
2237 2018-05-15 19:15:07 Unbelievable!!!  $100 for an oil change. Nothing else, just an oil change. I'm going back to doing them myself.
2238 2018-05-15 19:14:54 Shame to #Theresa_May & British for Condemning the Killing of Palestinians while Stealing Biafrans Oil & Sponsoring Killing Millions of them
2239 2018-05-15 19:14:49 some would actually try have you believe that Scotland could prosper on Oil & whisky exports alone!
2240 2018-05-15 19:14:45 if you do my hometown of Asheville, it'd be more of a VW van that runs on cooking oil. $3 local draft beer. great days ahead for you.
2241 2018-05-15 19:14:44 The CBD oil is a fair point though - this one long promotion minute at the beginning of every video is sinfully annoying
2242 2018-05-15 19:14:35 Er.. abang economist, only few refined petroleum products malaysia is nett importer. Even that is not consistent month on month. Higher crude oil price and MOPS will bring higher export rather than import.

Ckp macam malaysia rugi besar bila harga minyak dunia naik. Lol.
2243 2018-05-15 19:14:34 There no problem. Poppi made of special alloy. No need for rust or oil.

2259 2018-05-15 19:12:26 Ok Venezuela is effectively pegged to $ as it’s only industry is oil and there debt is mostly in $ which they can’t create obvs. IMF loan again related to oil after we were expelled from dollar zone and trade deficit in $. Labour were monetarist actually not hard left
2260 2018-05-15 19:12:14 It’s the same with alternate fuels. If anybody ever found a fuel that was sustainable and not running off oil, the government would never let it see the light of day. And you best believe the person who found it would be killed with shit they can’t trace in an autopsy report.
2261 2018-05-15 19:12:06 More green BS purely for marketing PR and appeasement of rabid greens WTurbines are not sustainable and cannot survive without coal oil and gas prospecting excavation shipping across oceans refining manufacturing deployment service & maintenance not possible without coal oil &gas

2267 2018-05-15 19:11:29 Watched a documentary where they were promoting a fat based diet where you only eat meat and veg and cover everything in lard and coconut oil. That is one diet I can get on board with.
2268 2018-05-15 19:11:15 The oil is in Scottish waters, the licenses will need to be bought from the (independent) Scottish Govt, the oil will be brought on shore in Scotland by companies registered in Scotland but you think the tax will go to rUK?  I would love to see you reasoning behind that.....

2278 2018-05-15 19:10:16 Yeah, I hate it so I would just add olive oil or ghee probably.
2279 2018-05-15 19:10:12 3) If the product label doesn't use the term "CBD", assume there is no CBD in the product. "Hemp Oil" is NOT the same as "CBD"! Lab results (aka "Certificate of Analysis" or "CoA") will verify what's in the product.

2283 2018-05-15 19:09:46 In the past, when oil prices would rise the Middle East would raise the amount of oil imported. The US could be totally energy independent if the oil/gas companies chose to be. Meaning high oil/natural gas prices. US does not need imported oil to survive.

2290 2018-05-15 19:08:58 One of the documents found in bin Laden's compound is titled "Extra Kufr for the Saudi regime" (Kufr = apostasy/infidelity), a judgment based on headlines in Arabic newspapers about a Saudi effort to 'salvage' American currency value drop through oil sales.

2294 2018-05-15 19:08:25 So basically... going back to your original question.. do I think it would be humane to go in a dark, confined, private place with a happy, healthy, half naked Naito who is covered in baby oil? 

Is it soft in the cage.. like do I have a mat down for him?
2295 2018-05-15 19:08:24 Got off the phone with Mr. Swinwood and I learned that in Fort McMurray (Northern Alberta) the harvesting of oil sands pollutes the nearby Athabascan water, which creates skin diseases and different types of cancer. #H2Oissues @mayawong88

2302 2018-05-15 19:06:59 Hamas is not the entirety of the Palestinian people. They're a group that took control given how everything was going to shit. You're telling me the US can't target hamas and blow them of the face of the planet ? Or is America only for freedom when there's oil and gas involved :)

2316 2018-05-15 19:05:51 "Also the oil whilst on Scottish soil so to speak will still be paying the British coffers- "

What does that even mean?
2317 2018-05-15 19:05:50 Summer is here which means it’s time to break out the pineapple body oil 
2318 2018-05-15 19:05:48 Salmon oil is my new nemesis.
2319 2018-05-15 19:05:43 If you’re trying to collab and use me as a Muse for a photoshoot 

I need a LEGIT concept & plan 

Not just oil , a light, and me standing in my underwear 

like come on now 

WHERE IS THE ART?!?!?!
2320 2018-05-15 19:05:33 
2321 2018-05-15 19:05:29 What do you mean by "doing more with less" @ present, crude oil sells for over $80/barrel...and you people Nigerians don't know what's happening abi...make una wait for me, I dey come for una.
2322 2018-05-15 19:05:27 .OK, so it's oil and not butter (need to get it hot enough to make sure it rises).

And its a YORKSHIRE PUDDING! Served with savoury Sunday dinner and meaty gravy in abundance.

I dread to see how you guys are going to butcher a toad in the hole...
2323 2018-05-15 19:05:26  What I usually do is put olive oil, salt, and Parmesan on them and then bake them for like 20 minutes on 350. When that’s done, broil them for 2-3 minutes
2324 2018-05-15 19:05:22 Sat resembling a slimy fat slug barely moving covered in baby oil praying this trick to getting your fake tan off actually works
2325 2018-05-15 19:05:04 Look closely at all the Ecuadorian-Russian oil deals (Rosneft).
2326 2018-05-15 19:05:00 Yes and that big lanky singer who has gone back to Midnight Oil whinged like hell, but could not stand up for what he knew was so damned wrong. Curse the pair of them, that includes Rudd. Talk about David and Goliath..... What a wimp!
2327 2018-05-15 19:04:57 Lonch: penne with sauteéd Brussels sprouts and a faux-snausage tossed in olive oil and a butter-like substance, S&P. Not at all bad. You've eaten worse.
2328 2018-05-15 19:04:55 Sorry, I went deep. Just waited 45 min for an oil change lmao
2329 2018-05-15 19:04:52 What oil now ??
2330 2018-05-15 19:04:41 Where did I say oil fields? Come on...
2331 2018-05-15 19:04:39 Why do the guys who change my oil show me that stick and tell me all about my oil that I know nothing about? Why do I nod and agree like I know what he’s saying?
2332 2018-05-15 19:04:34 Nah bio oil is a different kind of magic
2333 2018-05-15 19:04:19 I wonder if @sparks_stirling would be interested in joing us at some point. A Professor of Retail Studies. #indiehour

2335 2018-05-15 19:04:10 The Mulla Khamenei has 96 billion dollar wealth from Iran's oil and peoples pocket. Sure, he can spend some of that for medicine.

2337 2018-05-15 19:03:41 What kind of oil do y’all fry chicken in???
2338 2018-05-15 19:03:39 Well if you have olive oil and tomato sauce on your chocolate pudding there's a good chance you'll throw up down your shirt.
2339 2018-05-15 19:03:35 You are the No. 1 worst PM of India only because of your bad decision that not to reduce taxes from oil production . In every forthcoming election you & your party will be bitterly defited due to this reason only .Jay Koshal .

"I claim I don't know much about it, but that's because it's a little more complicated than a couple movin' parts an' some oil. Though body-altering potions...that's different."
2342 2018-05-15 19:03:15 The oil is ours. 
2343 2018-05-15 19:03:13 Possibly paint or some sorta plastic residue then. Plastic is oil based, so it could be oil. Is/was the mesh plastic?

2366 2018-05-15 19:01:11 Gotta go get an oil change tomorrow and they better just give me what I came for and nothing else.
2367 2018-05-15 19:01:09 Try castor oil, hair oil, and illegal immigration.
2368 2018-05-15 19:01:03 Put olive oil or salt water on it overnight!!
2369 2018-05-15 19:00:57 Today I entered bike from Oyigbo to Oil mill. Hai God, I was just chanting God please let me not die today.

I wonder is this is my life now. That road is worse than horrible.
2370 2018-05-15 19:00:54 Usually I make it up! The traditional proportion is 1:3 vinegar to oil, but I like mine acidic, so it's usually 1:1. (But I rarely measure, just add until it tastes good.) Mince garlic or shallot, white wine vinegar or lemon juice, olive oil, salt and pepper to taste.

2379 2018-05-15 19:00:03 @peeweetoms my dad runs a CBD oil business. I would be happy to send you some samples as they have cancer cell killing properties. It’s not a magic bullet. But it could significantly improve and maybe prolong you life.
2380 2018-05-15 19:00:03 I still can’t get over someone using fucking BABY OIL and gold pigment as a Body Lava dupe. All kinds of sun damage.
2381 2018-05-15 19:00:02 Use tea tree oil. Shit works wonders.
2382 2018-05-15 19:00:01 Gary, No, but we can by solving the oil problem which cuts their funding.  My engine can get 80-95% of the fuel GONE.  No Arab or Muslim money left to promote Jihad.  Help me find people to get this engine done, if you want to actually solve problems....
2383 2018-05-15 19:00:00 Caprese;
Campari tomato, fresh bufala mozzarella, basil and olive oil
2384 2018-05-15 18:59:56 Add lemon olive oil ....
2385 2018-05-15 18:59:56 What do you mean you can't de-carbonize crude oil? That statement is demonstrably false.
2386 2018-05-15 18:59:44 If we spent 1/10th the time researching alternative fuel sources such as hemp oil as we spend complaining about rising gas prices then maybe we could force the manipulators to end the fossil fuel exploitation.
2387 2018-05-15 18:59:38 Can’t even nap before work because I need a oil change 
2388 2018-05-15 18:59:30 i reeeaaaallllyyy want an oil defuser
2389 2018-05-15 18:59:16 Guy is just dripping oil
2390 2018-05-15 18:59:14 Look - we embrace immigration. And oil isn’t the only thing we have. Who supplies most of England with energy? Also, in an  Indy Scotland our exports will pass through Scottish ports- instead of through English ones. Especially our  whisky
2391 2018-05-15 18:59:13 I love your Sweet Dreams Soothing Body Oil

2393 2018-05-15 18:59:11 Yup. You can't decarbonize crude oil, in reality. But Alberta's plan does nothing to reduce emissions overall. At the VERY least, we must NOT expand it. But really it needs to be shut down entirely.
2394 2018-05-15 18:59:09 You'll be in a bar most of the day Liam you won't need the tanning oil 
2395 2018-05-15 18:59:08 i just spent $77 on oil for my truck

2399 2018-05-15 18:58:21 tip!! make sure that coconut oil is Virgin!! non-virgin coconut oil has stuff in it that you don’t want going into your skin :))
2400 2018-05-15 18:58:13 Сфоткай руку
2401 2018-05-15 18:58:10 I would suggest regular meditation with a focus on long deep breaths and associate it with a scent/oil that you find to be soothing. Keep the oil with you so, when you find yourself in a stressful situation, you can use it to trigger your mind into a relaxed meditation state.
2402 2018-05-15 18:58:03 Not real sure if it will be a contender with opioids but the CBD oil with some THC (not full strength) has allowed those on Xanax to ween themselves off of Xanax. As a plus, the people weening off the Xanax aren't  "numb" to life anymore.
2403 2018-05-15 18:57:58 why do u even think that anyone who is not american must be from desert & must have got rich coz of oil, shows exactly how ignorant americans as a nation are
2404 2018-05-15 18:57:49 No one needed to know this but I got an oil change, air in my tires, and internal/external car detailing for $40    yesterday and I feel like a new woman.
2405 2018-05-15 18:57:47 What good is living in a country that doesn't respect their own citizens and bomb other countries for oil?
2406 2018-05-15 18:57:32 Scottish oil revenues are barely a positive.
2407 2018-05-15 18:57:27 Oddly enough, it is not an oil shortage causing it either. It might help with new Bakken exploration to be started.
2408 2018-05-15 18:56:59 Super smart! I love this body oil, it's lightweight and has a nice, simple fragrance. Adding highlighter would be perfect.
2409 2018-05-15 18:56:55 "What is kitchen oil?"
"It's like.. like... kitchen sweat"
2410 2018-05-15 18:56:51 @TankerTrackers @Samir_Madani it seems either turkey refusing to sell oil to Israel or Israel refusing to buy from turkey. Not sure which. Going to be interesting for you guys where Israel gets its oil if Kirkuk is not being taken. I know how much you love tracking those ships
2411 2018-05-15 18:56:47 @LovelandFRA Hey. What was going on at 40th and Taft today?  Looked like oil dumping in the drain?  Thanks

2414 2018-05-15 18:55:43 Ok ok ok 
1. Most of my exec team was promoted directly from Jimmy John's sub shops 
2. We have 16" sandwiches now
3. My regular chips only have 3 ingredients: Salt, Peanut Oil, and Potatoes
4. I graduated last in my class
2415 2018-05-15 18:55:42 The same reason you'd strap an explosive pack on one.
2416 2018-05-15 18:55:40 So, the Alberta Climate Leadership Plan and the Carbon Competitiveness Incentives and fugitive methane emissions regulations count for nothing? You want to shut down the one heavy crude oil producing jurisdiction on the plant that is de-carbonizing its heavy crude? Really?
2417 2018-05-15 18:55:25 Very true about the shea butter over night. My skin feels less dry. I can’t do the oil on the face or else I’ll have breakouts all over. I do love just plan witch hazel in the warmer months. I’ll look up about sweet almond oil. I need something because I’m frying out here
2418 2018-05-15 18:55:25 Scottish Oil & Gas produces far more revenue than the London Financial sector ever has.
2419 2018-05-15 18:55:18 Gobo, want to really hit them?  Solve the oil problem.  My engine (non electric) can get 80-95% of the fuel out.  IC engine that can run on solar and electricity as well as most fuels.  Don't need an A-10.  Just need real patriots who want to cut off the oil money.
2420 2018-05-15 18:55:16 Unfortunately her people will believe and buy into her narrative because they either dont read or believe anything good can come from the Man from Daura,even if it passes through their bedroom.
2421 2018-05-15 18:54:54 It’s seriously the best body oil though

2427 2018-05-15 18:54:35 Really had a broad tell me she didn’t know she had to get oil changes 
2428 2018-05-15 18:54:33 Chump was supposed to be different because he wasn't beholden to the petrodollar oil interests, turns out it was the dollar in petrodollar controlling his thoughts and actions and influencing all his decisions.

Who knew? Who knew?
2429 2018-05-15 18:54:24 $ADM maybe but valero is still an oil company, $GPRE is spread wide and thin and cash corn buying/trading is horrendous... see who is around in 3-7 years be interesting and NOT thinking adm or valero are gone..
2430 2018-05-15 18:54:16 Significant decline in 2015-2016. Interesting especially in Oil and Gas. Wonder why?
2431 2018-05-15 18:54:05 Measure seven teaspoons of olive oil then put back on heat.
2432 2018-05-15 18:53:57 I have 30 gallons of fish oil in the back of my rig and if any spills I’m invoicing my employer for an entire new vehicle
2433 2018-05-15 18:53:56 I was taking oil of oregano diluted internally just now and then wondered why didn't I bother getting actual oregano and consuming that instead. 
2434 2018-05-15 18:53:43 I’d actually use garlic infused olive oil as lube it’s that peng
2435 2018-05-15 18:53:43 since yal STAY in my inbox, I need a oil change, car wash & FULL tank. Today!

2442 2018-05-15 18:52:53 I like to fry mine with coconut oil.
Sometimes I put bananas on it. Usually when I don't have pickles
2443 2018-05-15 18:52:47 How you could buy 440 million barrels of oil to give to Cuba because you and Fidel good?
2444 2018-05-15 18:52:39 I’m pretty sure Kamilah Stevenson is using anointing oil blessed and bottled by Jesus himself on her skin. It’s just flawless. Was perfect skin not my portion Lord?!

2457 2018-05-15 18:50:50 Q from @AmyAHarder should oil co’s be liable for climate change? A from @TomSteyer strong American tradition of responsibility for your actions, esp. when we know impacts- eg tobacco. #CAPIdeas
2458 2018-05-15 18:50:48 Someone should be accounted for it  and someone should know that we leave by our words.The power of the people lives within.... NO SECURITY NO PEACE NO OIL..NO ROAD NETWORK NO OIL that's it and we mean it @FredMatiangi @UKenyatta @TurkanaCountyKE @GovernorNanok

Israel
Iran’s enemy already fighting Iran.  Trump always wanted Iran’s oil.  Trump will defend Israel against Iran. Trump gets oil.

2463 2018-05-15 18:50:06 I’m calling for an oil change appt & she asked for vehicle and I say “2000 Honda Civic” & she goes “oh, Maria’s daughter ?” like yes , that is I. My mom well known here 
2464 2018-05-15 18:49:54 Well, it has, actually.
People aren't exactly flocking to Vermont for jobs and great weather.

2466 2018-05-15 18:49:49 Oil prices continue to rise, shortage of refining space, prices will only continue to rise.
2467 2018-05-15 18:49:48 I never mentioned antisemitism. I’m sure you’re absolutely lovely, you just need to stop buying snake oil.
2468 2018-05-15 18:49:45 Question: Our GDP per capita (as of 2017) was only $2,178 and we've been Africa's top producer of crude oil for nearly 50 years;

What does this say about us?
2469 2018-05-15 18:49:41 Funny, since republicans are the pipeline investors... Republicans own oil fields. Not democrats. Nice try though.
2470 2018-05-15 18:49:40 The price of essential commodities are still at all time high. Many Nigerians are still hungry and suffering. Security situation worsens daily. We are tired of these rhetorics. We are concerned with how much a cup of rice, beans,garri, palm oil etc cost in the market.
2471 2018-05-15 18:49:29 Last night my ass swallowed my oil cartridge I didn’t know I was gaining weight like that
2472 2018-05-15 18:49:26 It was never gonna happen. A p.r stunt that when getting closer to show date was always gonna be canceled. We need to go to REAL war with this regime, yet we are stuck in middle east for proxy wars, oil, drugs and arms sales to overthrow leaders our deep state doesnt like..SHAME!
2473 2018-05-15 18:49:13 I bought magnesium oil in a spray and I think I love. I've already applied it to my migraine sites and my crampy knees.

2477 2018-05-15 18:48:53 Coconut oil is good for everything I swear
2478 2018-05-15 18:48:50 It is 3.79 here in oil production state SD. 3.49 in oil production state WY. close to four bucks in oil production state ND.
2479 2018-05-15 18:48:45 Mainly vanilla, peppermint, lavender or orange.  To measure it I usually eye it solely because I’m too lazy to use measuring cups lol. But I want to say 1 cup of sugar to 3/4 cup of oil. And then a few (or a lot) of essence drops.
2480 2018-05-15 18:48:38 Hey, fuckwit, you got you're 5 min of fame. Maybe stop being a moron and personally attacking people because they like their province. I like Alberta just fine and you can take allll the pics of our oil and gas refineries you want and call it ugly but it doesn't mean anything.
2481 2018-05-15 18:48:37 Dish washer stank of oil for at least two weeks.
2482 2018-05-15 18:48:29 Hi James, can categorically say this is not a Tom Kerr from Holywood N.Ireland Tom predominantly worked in watercolour until early 90s then changed to the medium of acrylic, this looks like an oil and is a lovely painting none the less.Sorry it’s not an artist I recognise though
2483 2018-05-15 18:48:23 Congrats @ssskipy_74 on the signing with the Oil and the WHL Championship!
2484 2018-05-15 18:48:21 I put on coconut oil the other day and my skin is so incredibly soft  I love it

2486 2018-05-15 18:48:07 THANK U I REALLY LIKE PAINTING 
It reminds me of oil paint that I miss a lot :(
So this is a good alternative 
I'm so happy u think about my drawings this way

2490 2018-05-15 18:47:41 One huge misconception is thinking because your kid figured out Fruit Ninja at 11 months old, he will be tech-savvy. As if by learning to drive you learn to change oil.
2491 2018-05-15 18:47:31 If that's true why don't your Government just say so, we'll go happily and if it means our demise well you can just move in to our empty lands.

2495 2018-05-15 18:46:52 That’s up to us. Westminster is no great friend to Scotland. I’d have the EU any day . At least we won’t send all of our revenue south and get a sheer pittance back. Even without oil- Scotland is a viable nation and I’m afraid the political playing field has changed since 2014.

2502 2018-05-15 18:46:20 Oil exploration was not funded by the British government. Amazing that I have to explain that to you. Plus, most new discoveries are in the Atlantic. Plus even with the redrawn boundaries almost all North Sea oil fields are in the Scottish sector,

2514 2018-05-15 18:45:07 Then i exfoliated in coconut oil before i walked out not knowing how hot it was. Imm bake ! Imma fucking melt 
2515 2018-05-15 18:45:00 1. I would go to the beach and just use the sand (from the water, not on land) and exfoliate like that. It’s free and you get a beach day as well lol.       2. Coarse sugar, olive oil& grape seed oil mixed (equal parts) and because I’m extra I add essence to it....

2519 2018-05-15 18:44:28 depends on the problem, but the septum should be one of the quickest heals. general advice is: use lavender oil to clean it, twice a day. maybe switch out the closed ring with an open ring or staple, so you can flip it up if it keeps getting tugged on
2520 2018-05-15 18:44:28 Daleks gotta keep clean, too! (Although it's might be oil coming out of that shower head.)
2521 2018-05-15 18:44:24 Probably have to look where the money comes from and who owns them.
2522 2018-05-15 18:44:18 Mr. John A, Whereas the NNPC disclosed last week that it spent $396.33million on TAM for the four refineries between 1998 and 2008, an oil industry source stated that the last two comprehensive TAMs of the refineries were in 1995 and 2000.

2556 2018-05-15 18:41:38 Saw something about gas prices not mattering anymore on @CNBC yesterday. Premise was we produce more domestic oil; therefore, the money goes into our economy and not a foreign one. Not that I'm buying this but this is what they are selling.
2557 2018-05-15 18:41:37 Eeeh the only oil is raw
2558 2018-05-15 18:41:32 Anyone that says US shale oil production will have the same impact on oil prices in the US as US shale gas production has had on gas prices in the US doesn’t understand the global energy complex.

2596 2018-05-15 18:37:29 They will be in the street stalls and restaurants unless specified I’m afraid. The Lebanese takeaways are usually vegetable oil though. Don’t worry, I didn’t know the first time I went to Brussels.

2598 2018-05-15 18:37:21 The best tip I have ever received was when @jacksonxkrec said ”If you have a problem with acne, massage your face under warm water in the shower, it removes so much oil.” 
Thank you

It's Mexico's largest source of income, bigger than oil exports! This money should be taxed at the expatriation rate of 40% To pay for illegals on welfare

2612 2018-05-15 18:35:24 @Dove Hi! Do you still use palm oil in your products ? My mum is very much against it, and I would like to know whether to buy her something from you or not. Thanks in advance for reply!

I thought she is one of the PIIGS -Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece & Spain.
And the Irish are emigrating leaving the ones in Eire to sort things out.

It will end with a new Jews genocide.

2624 2018-05-15 18:33:04 No one said the oil sector is unimportant.
What is being said is oil can’t, alone, be blamed on the job losses.
Big difference.

Groggy in the mornings and my (probably not at all scientific) sleep tracker shows worse sleep quality.

I’ve tried different doses but interested in the experiences of those who aren’t trying to sell via affiliate.

2633 2018-05-15 18:32:16 If the butter is the problem, you could roast garlic to make into a paste. Mix up with a tiny bit of olive oil and salt. Then spread on the bread when it is nearly baked (otherwise garlic will burn). This would be garlicky but less fat?

2636 2018-05-15 18:31:59 Survived persecution then gave you latkes? Talked about racists tropes and holocaust? I hope you educated then better than that. Creating the first non secular belief?

2642 2018-05-15 18:31:23 Ingredients:

•1/4 of an avocado (mashed with fork) – super moisturizing
•1 slice of lemon (squeezed juice) – exfoliates and brightens
•1/2 tablespoon of olive oil – cleans and nourishes the skin
•1 tablespoon of honey – anti-inflammatory and kills germs
2643 2018-05-15 18:31:18 Thinking of banning truffle oil. From everywhere. Even when it's good (rarely) it's bad. Had it with prosciutto wrapped breadsticks at Mozza last night and it really just ruined some beautiful pork.   @evankleiman @thejgold @Russ_Parsons1 can you please explain?
2644 2018-05-15 18:31:11 Parce que les macrons servent mais pas dans le bon sens. Baisse du pouvoir d'achat, casse sociale, agression contre les retraités,  contre les APL, hausse essence, gaz oïl, électricité, gaz, loyers.... en opposition des milliards offert aux riches, plus de fraude fiscale
2645 2018-05-15 18:31:07 Nah, still manual control. Sears guy said its really just so it can say when it needs an oil change or whatever.

2652 2018-05-15 18:30:02 you think we’re buying this BS? Give us back the land you destroyed for your oil/gas/coal pals!
2653 2018-05-15 18:29:55 The Russian objectives are clear, to me anyway. 1. Eliminate sanctions imposed; 2. Middle East takeover of all oil assets and eliminating Israel. NK talks and Jerusalem +2, minus 1 Iran withdrawal. You win one Mr President.
2654 2018-05-15 18:29:45 Feel the energy every day.  My engine solves the energy problem.  It's a lot...save 500 billion/year in fuel.  Now that is a lot.  Unplug terrorist States...no oil, no money for terrorism.  Yah, I feel it every day in my bones.  Working to make it happen.
2655 2018-05-15 18:29:31 Oil is old fuel, they have found a way of fermenting Bananas to make gas; AND, that with a few barrels of lafs it will make them Richer even than they are now, in the fuel and entertainment business. Er, honest. True news true news folks!

2664 2018-05-15 18:28:29 พอจะบอกวิธีใช้ cleansing oil ได้มั้ยคือสับสนมากเลย ว่าพอนวดเสร็จแล้ว ควรล้างน้ำเฉย หรือปรมน้ำแล้วนวดต่อ

2668 2018-05-15 18:28:20 See that doesn't even register....and here is where I call shenanigans on this partisan charade, by every measure our economy is doing much better than say 2015. Of course things like oil prices are not anything we can control, but Liberal governance has been good for the economy

2671 2018-05-15 18:27:54 You a grown ass woman by now you know how to take your car to the car wash and when it needs an oil change. Your daddy should've taught you that when you got your first car.

@MboyaApollo After you are done with #SwitchOffKPLC let's revisit the ever increasing fuel prices especially Kerosene for the poor families that will soon retail at 100 yet we extract our own crude oil. Does it mean that we import our own commodity?
2675 2018-05-15 18:27:16 1. Tea Tree Oil  and Aloe Vera or 2. Green Tea ( not hot of course )
2676 2018-05-15 18:27:05 If I had to pick one, or maybe two,it would be paenut oil and bacon grease. Hands down.
2677 2018-05-15 18:26:55 WinCo is what full communism will look like in a third world country that doesn’t have oil reserves
2678 2018-05-15 18:26:51 We don't need it. We take Canada's oil and gas, which is like ours because, we're their only customer.
FYI Canada is #3 proven oil reserves on the planet. We good. Murica!

2697 2018-05-15 18:23:41 Kiwibuild is one of the best examples that the oil and gas exploration ban was about virtue signaling and Jacinda wanting big posters of herself. A Government actually committed to climate change would be facilitating change away from standalone housing

Last 3 oil  hikes all led to recessions.
2700 2018-05-15 18:23:24 Have you tried bio oil? It’s smells nice and it really absorbs quick after a bath. I use it for scars and aging on my face and I’ve read tons of positive reviews on it
2701 2018-05-15 18:23:22 Here I thought I had scored 3 and suddenly I realize that the goal posts have been moved farther down the field! U need 2 define the parameters of ur argument b/c it seems 2 change every time I mention anything. AB has no problem moving oil to USA market.
2702 2018-05-15 18:23:18 No thanks. I have to tighten and oil my shoe trees.
2703 2018-05-15 18:23:06 my grandmother just told me her cbd oil tastes like the color green... i gotta check this shit out
2704 2018-05-15 18:23:02 This is all about Oil, always has been. Keep the ME in perpetual turmoil, And the place so volatile, dictatorships are the only acceptable Government. And the best way to do so is through Religion, and a sectarian culture. A very sad stain on humanity. We can do better. Need to.
2705 2018-05-15 18:22:59 ..and when oil starts getting traded in ¥, there’s going to be so many unused dollars... they will be not worth much

A closed economy is not an option

2711 2018-05-15 18:22:31 I’ve just always thought it’d be fantastic to go back to having 2 tyre manufacturers in the sport to shake things up a bit. Teams can choose their own oil and fuel so why not their tyres. #bbcf1
2712 2018-05-15 18:22:31 You know that oil and gas development is a routinely discussed topic in BC when I just read someone's post about being kinder to oneself, and I internally pronounced "kinder" as in "kinder morgan".  #StopKM #pipeline #empathyovergreed
2713 2018-05-15 18:22:15 I know I'm getting older when I get excited by the herbal tea and shower/bath/essential oil stuff I've ordered

2715 2018-05-15 18:21:47 Hence my point of ag (pulse crops), potash and uranium jobs.  All commodity based, high paying, and in a downturn.  My point is all contribute but saying oil sector not important to SK is false.
2716 2018-05-15 18:21:45 Really specious comparison here. For one thing, the analysis considers the life-cycle emissions of electricity production, but only tailpipe emissions from petroleum vehicles. Producing, transporting and refining oil is a pollution-intensive activity.
2717 2018-05-15 18:21:42 oof add oil 
2718 2018-05-15 18:21:28 Isn't it colored due to oil slicks in region.....or may be mutation to survive the oil slicks in ocean....it will interesting to find out
@amritabhinder @AmandaBootes @suhelseth @NatGeo
2719 2018-05-15 18:21:25 How much money are you and ur buddies making off oil right now ? Americans pay the price for old white money getting richer. Watch a average everyday american run for office and do more for the people then you claim to do. Rich people only see color. Green not people they hurt.
2720 2018-05-15 18:21:23 I thought the US had oil coming out of its ears, yet, all I see is there is an oil shortage, and prices are going up. The world is full of liars, and the regular person on the street continues to be the victim.

2723 2018-05-15 18:21:15 How long do you keep cars?  Most of the EV crowd seem to get new ones every three years?  The reason - "technology keeps changing, I'll just lease".  Leasing a Volt might include one free oil change over the 3-years.  Had my Volt 6 years and none of those extras apply yet.

2725 2018-05-15 18:21:01 Might take up quietly oil painting as a hobby
2726 2018-05-15 18:20:42 Ppl be buying expensive cars for the sake of flexin, then can’t eat cause a car oil change costing a grand, and can’t take it to a regular degular place cause they will fuck up your car
2727 2018-05-15 18:20:39 Greed. And when will the next depression start which always follows big oil greed grab?

2731 2018-05-15 18:20:33 And BCers are tired of taking all the risk for YOUR project. Oh, wait, its not your project its a Texan oil companies project. #Shame! Talk about "Canadian national interest"
2732 2018-05-15 18:20:13 This is really not about religion...it is about power, oil, and $$$$$$$$$$$
2733 2018-05-15 18:20:10 What? I post the links to all my videos and my live streams. Maybe I'm  not understanding your question Oil Wife.  I do think it is odd for people to like their own tweets but the whole point of having twitter is to share content, from everyone, including yourself.
2734 2018-05-15 18:20:03 I hate wasting time and sitting at the Nissan dealership waiting for my oil to be changed is exactly that, a Big #WasteOfMyTime been here for over an hour (thus far). Free or not next time I'll go to a quick lube. I really like my #Rogue though.
2735 2018-05-15 18:19:58 try some nose oil...takes that foam right away.
2736 2018-05-15 18:19:33 Ngapain itu Luhut ngurusin Palm Oil? Emang masuk bagian kemaritiman? Bener-bener menkosaurus. Apa-apa pengen pasang badan.
2737 2018-05-15 18:19:32 Well, the fact that Ben has a Texas Oil billionaire funding his podcast might be partially responsible for that.

Also, the fact that Ben is milquetoast and mainstream.

2754 2018-05-15 18:17:59 What fades stretch marks besides bio oil?
2755 2018-05-15 18:17:59 @realDonaldTrump how can gas prices be rising when we are producing crude oil at record numbers in the US?
2756 2018-05-15 18:17:52 The bios are remaining in the accumulation phase even on these down days.    I’ve taken some oil off the table and fishing those bios for the next leg.
2757 2018-05-15 18:17:44 Trump was elected. Plain and simple.

2767 2018-05-15 18:16:54 @trish_regan I think the market is being driven down by the manipulation of oil prices to unnecessary highs. It has effectively erased the Trump Tax Cuts.
2768 2018-05-15 18:16:48 I tried. This thing its crazy. Maybe it's wors oil

2769 2018-05-15 18:16:47 Yeah oil level has been prime. Only thing I’m thinking is either stuck lifter or bad oil pump

2781 2018-05-15 18:15:39 you do realize, including under Harper, that over 80% live under a carbon tax already right? You know, before the drop in oil prices caused our government to run in a tizzy over something that was easily foreseeable. Not about cost of oil, about setting up reliable energy system
2782 2018-05-15 18:15:35 Hey CTFO Free CBD Oil Business thanks for the follow!

2793 2018-05-15 18:14:33 That isn't even ice cream, it's frozen dairy desert. because SOMEBODY thought it was a good idea to make ice cream out of palm oil instead of cream.

2799 2018-05-15 18:13:35 wake up and get real. Arithmetic can be learned. When the US and Israel are pouring oil on a raging fire the only ones to benefit are the arsonists. Why to you think EU's top guns keep a stoic silence?

you pour it in a lake everything still dies XD
2818 2018-05-15 18:11:49 Trump knew well this would inflame tensions, but he is willing to set the world on fire to distract from his legal woes. Bibi benefits for same reason. And Putin approves, because when there is unrest in Midfle East, oil prices rise. Russia’s economy is oil based. Shame on Trump
2819 2018-05-15 18:11:42 Same question i asked myself, they want people to believe that the oil might be the magic for sundowns achievements. I also feel sorry for desperate
2820 2018-05-15 18:11:36 thanks. But there's no Oil Rogue on the list. There's only Kingsbane and the old school ("N'Zoth") Mill Rogue ;)

2823 2018-05-15 18:11:10 Hope you put some oil on 
2824 2018-05-15 18:10:57 Oil is killing us. There are alternatives to oil; people can still make money, but the oil has to stop - as a species, we're out of time if we don't. #cdnpoli #KinderMorgan
2825 2018-05-15 18:10:56 Basically you don't give a f..k on what the Israelis found in #teheran about the "deal" You guys are sitting in a comfortable chair in Brussels and what concerns you is only politic and oil that Iran gives you but not the Israeli secuirty. No worries, we will make the dirty job
2826 2018-05-15 18:10:45 So @realDonaldTrump has our energy/oil kicking ass... yet gas prices went up 50 cents in 2 weeks where I live. It is now higher than it has been on years. Makes no sense.
2827 2018-05-15 18:10:32 There’s no better feeling on holiday than getting in the shower n washing all the tanning oil off to see your legs bronzed af
2828 2018-05-15 18:10:27 Just wait until the fall harvests start and the markets are gone. $14 billion in soy won't be shipped,and it's time to by fuel oil for heat. So much winning !
2829 2018-05-15 18:10:26 No. Solar and wind are intermittent and unreliable resources that will not work without backup from natural gas or coal. If we want to tackle climate change,we have to replace fossil with nuclear. Also, because of fracking, the U.S. no longer depends on Middle Eastern oil and gas

2837 2018-05-15 18:09:50 things i love accidentally covered in oil. too often
2838 2018-05-15 18:09:42 So sub out some of the eggs w/olive oil, use less sugar in the recipe, make the dessert servings small, and eat just 1-2 cookies/brownies in the day. The rest can go in the freezer for later. You don't have to give up everything enjoyable to lose/maintain weight. 
2839 2018-05-15 18:09:29 Interesting that oil changes are the only maintenance you consider.  Coolant flushes, transmission flushes, air filters, fuel filters, fuel pumps, oil pumps, injector cleaning, and so many other things must not apply to the Volt ?
2840 2018-05-15 18:09:28 @JasonTorchinsky you’ve correctly ID’d the Oiler. I believe the front tank is the gas tank/surface carb, and the wire 2 steering is the choke/mixture. The lines coming off the rear tank are too thin to be a manifold. I think it’s possible the rear tank is the oil tank 1/
2841 2018-05-15 18:09:18 Do it & a little bit of lavender oil will help too

2846 2018-05-15 18:08:55 You avoid using oil?
2847 2018-05-15 18:08:53 Doesn't matter. As far as market concerns there is risk so oil is keep going up and willcontinue to do so in near term
2848 2018-05-15 18:08:52 That's why poo is at new highs while we are still massively down. Giles Clark needs to step down and let a proper oil chairman take over. No updates on rex harbour selling the market won't react till he's finished.

2867 2018-05-15 18:06:02 First, I see it justified by solidarity by in the end explained by the very practical reciprocal benefits Cuba and Venezuela have from their alliance.

Second, the fact that cash strapped Venezuela is spending money on oil is indicative of how bad the crisis is.

2871 2018-05-15 18:05:40 Obama could say he opposed the war in Iraq because he never voted on it. I'm unaware of what his major accomplishments in Illinois were. This doesn't take away his exceptional skills, but he won because he was a blank slate.
2872 2018-05-15 18:05:28 There r ppl who think you get high from the oil,  that is why they r against it

2888 2018-05-15 18:03:57 @DrMarla I think you need to leave the city to find women who work in heavy physical jobs.  I was just watching your talk on CTV about highly physical jobs.  I spent several years moving oil barrels and crates of oil.  Very demeaning towards women`s capabilities.
2889 2018-05-15 18:03:51 You can expect to pay even more soon as Iranian oil goes back offline because of the sanctions . Putin will win, oil gulf states oil companies... Summer will be hot this year !

2892 2018-05-15 18:03:35 I wonder how many members of the @GOP were promised a piece of the ROSNEFT oil deal?

2915 2018-05-15 18:00:34 Have you looked at the price of oil recently? When was the last time oil, a diminishing resource, ‘propped up’ the UK economy? 

Denying facts won’t help you win the Indy campaign btw. You people sound kinda deranged and most sensible see through it.

2921 2018-05-15 18:00:10 Exactly—an Indy Scotland would take a per-capita share of liabilities (in return for per-capita share of non-fixed assets); but the figure to be more concerned with is debt:GDP ratio. And oil isn't keeping the UK afloat—~£200m in 2016–17?
2922 2018-05-15 18:00:08 The US reacted violently when native Americans peacefully protested against oil pipelines.

2931 2018-05-15 17:58:58 Plus, when a better tech comes along, you just take down the solar farm or windmill. You can't get the coal, oil, or uranium back.
2932 2018-05-15 17:58:41 No! Oil comes full circle when it skirts $110 AND Goldman Sachs predicts it hitting $200. It did this twice, and within months oil was below $40 and $30.
2933 2018-05-15 17:58:39 Well, @hilarybennmp, as you usually vote in favour of a good bit of bombing, maybe you’ll instigate a vote to drop a few on Israel now? What could possibly go wrong? And anyway, at least it would boost arms sales which is always the most important thing after oil, eh?
2934 2018-05-15 17:58:26 As a Powerplant Engineer trained in Solar, Wind turbine, Hydro-Electric, even Nuclear it's discusting me to see Trump take the U.S. backwards Decades almost daily! Coal?

Costs related to environmental damage, health problems and climate change are also NOT being covered by Big Oil. They externalize costs & internalize the profits.

2981 2018-05-15 17:51:55 Enough for that. GWs family $ is almost all in domestic oil, so when opec was making a bundle during his terms it wasn't really beneficial to him, not like now when our domestic output is way higher.

2987 2018-05-15 17:51:31 I am not oblivious, just tired of being expected to solve every problem in the world. Time the oil rich Middle East countries to take in some of their fellow Muslims who need help.
2988 2018-05-15 17:51:02 How do you suggest we do that? I’ll give you three Industries right now, Oil, corn, poultry, and tell me everything that I need to know about them to make informed policy decisions? The honest answer is that you can’t. You need lobbyist for information. With that comes some bad!
2989 2018-05-15 17:50:54 To be fair oil prices have gone up but the situation is worsened by the CST the liberals are imposing on us. It is doubly painful because CST also deters investment in the energy sector that provides good paying jobs that also provide a lot of taxes for the government.
2990 2018-05-15 17:50:46 This govt has messed up repeated opportunities to make @Swamy39 our finance minister. 

Now look at the way how currency, bond yields and oil prices are shaping up. Scary times ahead. There will be hell to pay.

Smooth talking won't hide economic vulnerabilities forever.

2992 2018-05-15 17:50:26 I have a final at 11, yet here I am getting an oil change 
2993 2018-05-15 17:50:18 It depends what type of oil your intaking ... the more define of oil you are exposing your body too the better it is ... the cheap shit will destroy your lungs ...
2994 2018-05-15 17:50:18 Broasted Chicken because it's cooked in a pressure fryer which seals in the natural juices and less oil is absorbed. So you get tender, juicy chicken that's actually healthier than open fried chicken. Also has a light crispy coating that's delicious when you bite into it.

2999 2018-05-15 17:49:47 If Trump is for it, they're against it.

Plus Obama pretty clearly hated Israel.
3000 2018-05-15 17:49:36 LW: By the 1990s there was talk of ‘Peak Oil’. But the fracking revolution has meant that the US now has more oil production that Saudi Arabia. The ingenuity of Texas oilmen has changed the world #LSETexas
3001 2018-05-15 17:49:36 I just bought coconut oil, baby oil, and shea butter. Summer smooth skin is coming.
3002 2018-05-15 17:49:31 They get to attack, lose territory, then ask for a do over? Israel was very restrained. They could have taken ALL of several countries.
3003 2018-05-15 17:49:25 Is there any peace even with in the Arab Nations, Saudi Arabia and UAE trying to muscle with their oil money no Brain for Science ,expatriate Americans doing everything Iran that has little brain for Science are been fought vigorously with the Arab combination with Americans.

3008 2018-05-15 17:48:46 Trade negotiations with Canada in regards to NAFTA still slow. Donnie doesn't realize that buying Cdn crude oil for $24 Cdn a barrel under NAFTA is better than buying it from Saudi Arabia at $72 USD/ barrel under OPEC  So he plays kiss the Communists and screw the neighbours
3009 2018-05-15 17:48:31 Who wants to join my money team and start there own hemp business!! CBD oil is changing lives physically mentally and financially. I have 4 spots open on my team ! Don't forget it takes money to make money and becoming your own boss the biggest investment should be in yourself

3011 2018-05-15 17:48:08 Everyone is posting this whole: skin care is awesome. It is. But pls help my dry skin that over rides any oil ever. Holy shit.
3012 2018-05-15 17:48:07 Yes:  I spray water mixed with either grape seed, olive or jojoba oil or the @Drlocs Yaya oil And because my hair gets dry very often, I use a leave-in conditioner also by @Drlocs every two days and make sure I wash my hair regularly
3013 2018-05-15 17:48:06 Trump is busy setting up his future income. The hotel in Indonesia, his share of a Russian oil company, hiding the bribe money Michael Cohen got for him, hiding the unspent money from his inauguration, etc.  He's just doing what comes natural for a lifelong con man.
3014 2018-05-15 17:48:03 @realDonaldTrump I just saw a sign at @Shell in Olympia Wa. $3.59 gal this is what happens when you tear up the #IranDeal it helps Saudi ARABIA and RUSSIA sell more oil and WE PAY FOR IT thanks alot asshole
3015 2018-05-15 17:48:03 yea but not because of abortion, murica found ways that are better for that. you guys hand out instruments of death to people who are unfit to carry them, eat so much meat, eggs etc, put oil in the fire that burns trought middle east...
3016 2018-05-15 17:47:59 Chilli oil isn’t
3017 2018-05-15 17:47:36 Re-looting of LOOT!, why not use it to build a power generating station, or an oil refinery or buy new coaches for Train, or even part payment for national shipping line. Mehn I kowtow for this kind our leaders. @ProfOsinbajo @NGRPresident @WorldBank

3020 2018-05-15 17:47:28 Because Leftists hate Jews.
3021 2018-05-15 17:47:26 Lol it's actually mega easy. I use Tesco Mediterranean roasting vegetables (it's pre sliced and on 2 for 3) I just cut it a bit smaller and fry it in olive oil spray then take it out, clean frying pan, add 3 mixed eggs and put the cooked veg on top then add cheese at the end!
3022 2018-05-15 17:47:19 Baby oil is the solution apparently xx

3026 2018-05-15 17:46:57 Market always thinks oil is a safe haven in bear markets, then reality kicks in
3027 2018-05-15 17:46:53 @realDonaldTrump @JoinTravisAllen @RealErinCruz With the US producing record amounts of oil, why are citizens being price gouged at the gas pump? #RepealGasTax
3028 2018-05-15 17:46:43 I've found tea tree (melaleuca) oil very helpful.

3041 2018-05-15 17:45:58 I really need this oil
3042 2018-05-15 17:45:50 I got this.. This one is simple... Because Trump is Pro Israel.. I think Trump should change parties... You know what would happen.. Every man woman and Child in the country legal or not would be a registered Republican.
3043 2018-05-15 17:45:49 @therealroseanne  here's a story idea... instead of roseanne freaking out because of her pharm drugs being taken away what about introducing the notion of how therapeutic cannabis & cannabis oil is. you could really make it funny  &  make a real difference.
3044 2018-05-15 17:45:39 As many other conflicts this is only about natural resources so as oil, gas and minerals.
3045 2018-05-15 17:45:36 Oil dey your head
3046 2018-05-15 17:45:29 Have you looked in the mirror dear, not exactly an oil painting are we, perhaps you should take your own advice and get plastic surgery.
3047 2018-05-15 17:45:22 Check your Engine oil this morning.
3048 2018-05-15 17:45:15 I always thought Pence a cheap hypocritical soap box preacher/snake oil salesman.
3049 2018-05-15 17:45:10 Get it built. Canada should not be buying oil from overseas, especially from the mid-east, when there is enough in ground at home to be independent and to prosper from exporting Canadian oil at fair prices.

3051 2018-05-15 17:45:09 Add a twist to your next salad with this Hoisin Dressing recipe:

2 tsp. ginger, minced 8 oz.
3052 2018-05-15 17:44:58 And there is a pretty big connection to the #Oil delivery systems.  Most of the cars that move on that section of track are #OilCars the same oil that cannot flow because of the lack of east west and southern #pipelines! #BusinessIsBooming. Fact is, the oil will get to market
3053 2018-05-15 17:44:47 Maybe the Evangelical pirates should stop whipping religion into it. Faith and trump mix like oil and urine.
3054 2018-05-15 17:44:46 My face is wicked sensitive and the minute I put any kind of oil on my face I break tf out :/
3055 2018-05-15 17:44:36 well usually WebMD provides good info but in this case I strongly disagree, CBD oil heals period.  I have seen it myself and highly  recommend people with any condition try it.  it is simply amazing.

3058 2018-05-15 17:43:46 The idea that Veg can provide sufficient important vitamins etc over meat / fish products was debunked in the @Telegraph just the other day. 

I do agree tho that farting Cows, Sheep etc contribute more to Climate change - as does the destruction of Forests for Palm oil.
3059 2018-05-15 17:43:43 Four kitchen boxes packed. Two loads of laundry, including the draperies for “spring cleaning”. Oil change. Keys collected for return. It’s the end of the line for this apartment, and I’m more relieved than I can express. I’ve had it with transiency; I’m ready for #OurPlace.

3064 2018-05-15 17:43:05 That’s not the cause to world hunger  if u wanna go in-depth to the cause it’s politics 3rd world countries sit ontop of oil reservoirs which is key to military strength all the starving countries are at war over religion and politics not because of how fertile the land is

3069 2018-05-15 17:42:19 Pruitt is increasing the problems of politicization of the EPA to absurd levels. You don't put out a fire by throwing oil on it.

3072 2018-05-15 17:41:40 I'd move up Face Hunter to tier 3. 
Not sure if you want to make a distinction between Oil & Kingsbane Rogue since both are roughly the same tier but slightly different decks.
Oh and get ready to delete Giant decks from the list!
That's it for now. Excellent Work!

3076 2018-05-15 17:41:04 Started roasting my vegetables in coconut oil and its miraculous
3077 2018-05-15 17:41:02 Arafat enlisted Abu Abbas and many others. They were taken from the prison cells of the countries of origin, members of the league, trained in terrorism and given a mission.
Through his liason with the oil rich Iran (and  Iraq) he secured the funding for his organisation.
3078 2018-05-15 17:41:00 Idk how you'd respond if you were opressed in a country you cannot leave, with armed guards constantly stationed around you 
They have 0 representation in government 

So yeah I'd say throwing rocks is pretty fucking restrained

3080 2018-05-15 17:40:20 It was Frank Luntz, the oil industry, and the GOP that came up with the term Climate Change - it was to mitigate the negative connotations of "Warming" - to replace it with something more innocuous. It is warming. That's the change.

3086 2018-05-15 17:39:32 And choosing these time and days to move an embassy is just adding oil on a fire. Does the world really need this? I don't think so.
3087 2018-05-15 17:39:20 I got up & sat right back down. The pain is gone. I had to make sure it wasnt a fluke. We both was cracking up. I have been in pain since last Wednesday. Im getting CBD oil for my massages also. It feels like heaven.

3100 2018-05-15 17:37:27 It is unimaginable that a country the size and modernity of Canada would not have a single pipeline to either coast in order to export it's oil at full world price.

And the info in the dossier that said Trump received a percentage of the sale of Russian oil company Rosneft is true!
3127 2018-05-15 17:34:00 No,  Not false. Elliott specifically said that the loss of 1,000 oil field jobs does not have a dramatic impact on spinoff jobs. He points to lost jobs in places like Sk’toon,  North, Yorkton-Melville
3128 2018-05-15 17:33:54 @realDonaldTrump hypothesized the White House would be “pay to play” after the election if HRC made it. 

He’s almost correct - just no HRC. 

ZTE, Mar-a-Lago, (guest list?), tax returns, AT&T, Novartis, EPA and Pruitt giveaways to oil. 

Sounds like a Billy Joel song.

3133 2018-05-15 17:33:14 The producers of this show would like to offer this legal statement;

These contestants are under medical supervision. We recommend that viewers, under no circumstances, try to live on a diet of oil preserved lemons, chilli chocolate and five kinds of pink Himalayan salt.

3136 2018-05-15 17:32:34 Didn't realize that by ordering an oil from @younglivingeo they would release our phone number to their local representatives who would keep calling.... not a fan at all of that.

3148 2018-05-15 17:30:56 I don't understand why they would develop the tar sands extraction which is expensive and difficult if free crude oil were continuing to get made by some infinite underground factory. Tar sands are far far less efficient than conventional fields
3149 2018-05-15 17:30:49 I should be sleeping and taking a good nap right now.. but this oil change for my car had to happen today

3182 2018-05-15 17:26:48 Wow.  Almost $300 million spent b/w 2012 and 2017?  

That's a lot of money for a poor country that depends on high oil prices and external financing.  Hmmm.
3183 2018-05-15 17:26:40 Venezuela needs to recover its productivity. El chavismo killed most of the private sector and made the economy fully dependent on oil. Wgen the oil went down it collapsed. Add to that that they also bankrupted most of the National industries including Oil.

3198 2018-05-15 17:24:20 Soooooo i got this oil leak and i seen some oil leak stopper stuff. I wonder do it work.? 
3199 2018-05-15 17:24:08 Good question. Depends on the driver, which is US yields, driven by higher oil prices. This means that lower yields ( via lower oil or dovish Fed talk) will stop the run on EM. If the focus was originally EM, then the rout would need EM solutions (like standby plans with the IMF)

3204 2018-05-15 17:23:17 People who tithe sh200 in church, can't afford to buy bananas at Nakawa. They are scraping to get the sh1000 to buy half a kilo of salt. Or they need the sh200 to buy a spoon of cooking oil (spoon isn't accurate, but there is some measurement sell cooking oil for sh100

3210 2018-05-15 17:23:05 Please try CBD oil 
3211 2018-05-15 17:23:03 If the oil industry weren’t propped up by the government via subsidies and tax rebates, our oil prices would reflect the actual scarcity of this resource, and might make Americans reconsider gas-guzzling, polluting monster vehicles.

3221 2018-05-15 17:21:23 One time I borrowed my brothers Benz for a road trip and told him I’d get an oil change...that oil change was $129. I knew then foreign wasn’t for me.
3222 2018-05-15 17:20:29 No surprise here. The U.S. is one of the world's largest oil producers so a higher #oilprice = more $ AND they're IN the conflict business. As for the rank & file, the debt problem is exacerbated.

3254 2018-05-15 17:17:10 It’s because these news sources are funded by big oil and they can’t stand the fact that Tesla continues to grow and prove everyone wrong. So they try to scare the general public. Autopilot is already safer than humans and that’s proven fact.

3258 2018-05-15 17:16:50 What’s the cost of oil per barrel I heard it’s no longer 37 dollars but now 83 ... more with less hmmm

Trump needs to remember Arabs control oil. U S Gas prices at the pump are increasing. Trump slandering Palestinians is not a good idea right now.
3261 2018-05-15 17:16:08 Well you’re no oil painting yourself matey, but congratulations on fatuous tweet of the day
3262 2018-05-15 17:16:07 Do NOT take black seed oil by itself, please mix it with a cup of warm water and honey. Be smart, don’t be like me.
3263 2018-05-15 17:15:58 Like leave a tin can of used cooking oil on the kitchen counter at all times.
3264 2018-05-15 17:15:45 Nazis are good, Muslims are bad, Mexicans should be walked off, immigrants have no skills, McCain is not a hero, the EPA is a waste, big business needs tax breaks, more off shore oil drilling, hibernating bears should be shot, and Putin is God’s gift to humanity.
3265 2018-05-15 17:15:43 My father doesn't grow cocoa, but I have a palm oil farm myself. I have friends that grows yam, cassava etc. Its been all smiles because of Buhari's agricultural policies. Stop hating from the desert bro.

3268 2018-05-15 17:15:35 Yes, Zinke apparently trusts Interior police staff--unlike those dedicated to conservation--the latter are among the "disloyal" employees. How can you work for him when only time he mentions "conservation" is when coupled with oil-gas-coal-welfare ranchers?

3273 2018-05-15 17:15:11 Mike, want to get out of middle east?  You need to solve the oil problem.  My engine can do that.  National security issue!  It seems the USA government WANTS us to burn $500 billion in fuel unnecessarily.  Put another way, want to save $500 billion/year in fuel?  Discuss?
3274 2018-05-15 17:15:09 Oh yeah, I’m a huge Cabin Boy fan too. Let me chug this bottle of Wesson oil...

The GOP and oil companies have conned you. 

Wake up, America!
3279 2018-05-15 17:14:48 America as well didn't (and still doesn't) mind partying with muslim dictators as long as they got oil and military posts in return. So why blame UN?
3280 2018-05-15 17:14:42 He hasn't. Destroyed the environment, that is. Instead, he appears to have made a token effort to appease Big Oil, and is about to fail with a shrug.
3281 2018-05-15 17:14:40 Haha i just used some essential oil to refresh. Although it was peppermint so I burned a little. But now it’s a pleasant cooling sensation

3295 2018-05-15 17:12:40 I didn't see the CBC piece referenced, but I suspect it has something to do with Trump opening up national parks and sensitive offshore areas to oil & gas drilling.
3296 2018-05-15 17:12:20 Woo hoo! Another customer woke up without back pain today because of our oil! 

3297 2018-05-15 17:12:16 Oil pan leak. Awesome.
3298 2018-05-15 17:11:53 Guess I'll get out of bed and go get my oil changed 
3299 2018-05-15 17:11:04 Also, consider how much more money the US would be making if they sided with the Arab states, which are all rich in oil.

3303 2018-05-15 17:10:35 Anyone who props up these snake oil salesman deserve to get fleeced. Idiots. Salvation isn’t for sale.
3304 2018-05-15 17:10:26 Palestinians are backed by the entire Arab World and useful idiot Europeans, a rather large chunk of the world. As mass scale butcheries happen around the world, the UN, dominated by oil rich Arab states, passes one resolution after another targeting Israel.  It's not even close.

3306 2018-05-15 17:10:17 @mmastocks bullish on oil because Trump gave ME to Putin.  He can stir war there for higher prices he needs.  U S loses to Russia power.

3310 2018-05-15 17:09:44 Hi, we do! I just read through your thread too. If you decide on the oil, it's for body only, a few drops will give her a nice subtle glow. Not too much for her age. An alternative? our Hi-Lit Drops can be used for face/body but it is considered makeup.
3311 2018-05-15 17:09:43 ok here's how i can wear scent in the summer:

a) shower at night
b) after shower, in air conditioning, apply essential oil blends (NO perfume sprays)
c) 12 hours later i can still smell just enough on my wrists to be nice without migraines
3312 2018-05-15 17:09:33 Also what the fuck is going on in Israel?! If that was happening in any other middle eastern country there would be another war kicking off. They seem to literally get away with murder all the time! Must be any "Oil" there...
3313 2018-05-15 17:09:30 Check your watch. Time to oil Ty Ty up and do some burpees.
3314 2018-05-15 17:09:28 The push to increase RE in France (nuclear to 50%) under the last two govs has been partly driven by worries about having too many eggs in one (nuclear) basket. Nuclear energy is as secure as its fuel market. That has to date proven to be much more secure than coal, gas and oil
3315 2018-05-15 17:09:26 Oil Run
3316 2018-05-15 17:09:25 Avocado oil is good for you and has a high smoke point!
3317 2018-05-15 17:09:18 Yam and red oil couple with steam onion and a lil ogiri for Igbo's.... But can go without ogiri if not seen. Yummy.
3318 2018-05-15 17:09:18 It's swishing an oil ( usually coconut oil) in your mouth for 10-20 mins and then brushing after  people say it has a lot of benefits and is better than flossing but you should still do both. I personally love it and my teeth always feel super clean. Brush after tho!

3325 2018-05-15 17:08:28 Let’s be honest, had you not fallen backwards into this hot crybaby Conservative “job”, you’d just be every other Instagram THOT pushing some protein shake, essential oil or bikini line.
3326 2018-05-15 17:07:51 So vele you’re not going to do the things and mix us the Nomzet body skin oil? @2uli 
3327 2018-05-15 17:07:41 probably. i just want us to go w/o oil and tell them all to go screw.
3328 2018-05-15 17:07:18 WTI oil at $71.77/barrel, +$0.81.
3329 2018-05-15 17:07:18 I was pretty skeptical when I bought it, but it's now one of my favorite foundations.  I also like the Flower Light Illusion foundation, but that doesn't come in really any dark colors, maybe just tan.  I have oily skin and I had no oil breakthrough, has a dewy finish, too.

3333 2018-05-15 17:07:05 Mike, want to solve the terrorist problem?  How? Solve the OIL problem!
My engine could get 80-95% of the fuel out of the average American's life.  If world wide, we solve lots of problems.  No pipelines needed.  No "deals" with terrorist States.  Know anybody who wants to solve?

3335 2018-05-15 17:07:01 Sooo if Tillerson was there to dismantle the State Dept. and Pruitt is there to destroy the EPA and Zinke is there to ensure we trash the environment for oil, I'm guessing pensions will be just fine.

3345 2018-05-15 17:06:09 For one, that Page would get 20% of Russia's state oil company, and two, that Cohen went to Prague. Interestingly, they got the wrong Cohen. How did that happen? Well they searched the 702 database for his name and just ran with it to smear Trump. Sad you buy all this garbage.
3346 2018-05-15 17:06:02 A hardcore vegan wouldn’t eat anything with palm oil in cause of the situation with gorillas / orangutans so that’s probably why it doesn’t say vegan
3347 2018-05-15 17:05:45 You have a motor scooter? Or an oil reserve in your backyard? Lol
3348 2018-05-15 17:05:30 Just landed in Namibia to asses a 22 600 km2 oil and Gas concession of a prospective client, Africa New Energies,
3349 2018-05-15 17:05:29 F*** off anyone wanting to rape the Great Australian Bight. Big oil, big coal and all their greedy hangers on and political lackeys have had their day. The destruction must and will end.

3351 2018-05-15 17:05:17 China is the big wild card in Trump's Iran decision  +++ More like the win card....They will buy oil and sell finished products that Americans won't be making...so it's MORE LOST poor red state JOBS.

3356 2018-05-15 17:04:40 Are these estimations based on new projects that will increase the production or new oil discovery?
3357 2018-05-15 17:04:37 According to YOUR MOM, 15 million barrels of oil are used annually to manufacture water bottles

3363 2018-05-15 17:04:04 Texas always passing anti consumer laws to protect their special interest. The gas and oil companies contribute to their campaigns for protection. Texas is anti consumer and very pro business. Where does Texas think these companies get the money to contribute to their elections?

3380 2018-05-15 17:02:25 Well pulling out of the Iran deal could possibly be as much about driving oil prices thru the roof for financial gain. It’s not like Trump didn’t know it was gonna happen. Just saying
3381 2018-05-15 17:02:11 I was annoyed with my parents the  but appreciate them so much for it now. I can cut grass, change tires, put oil in my car, change out windshield wipers AND cook, clean, wrap gifts like a pro, braid and press hair etc.
3382 2018-05-15 17:01:56 What exactly is added to lotion, oil or soap to make it "for men"? And does it mean we had been using "for women" products all that time before the men's were introduced?

3398 2018-05-15 17:00:57 @J_Link89 Well, lucky for you we're not big fishers. But we can provide for your love of olive oil. Ever been by before?

3405 2018-05-15 17:00:23 おーまだ起きてたのかー作業か？無理するなよ？
3406 2018-05-15 17:00:09 Well Rahul don't you think that all fruit will be grab by jds as they are king now ?? And then there will be possibility of breaking Congress MLA if fruits were offered by BJP...dimag lagao afwa Na failao
" Na 9 man oil hoga na Radha nachegi"
3407 2018-05-15 16:59:58 The Lip oil sounds right up my street!
3408 2018-05-15 16:59:48 Got the Hawaiian Silky, olive AND the castor oil combo in my hair today so now I'm really about to level up on you niggas today
3409 2018-05-15 16:59:48 Thank you! My plane reservations may have been more due to fear of flying with a toddler than oil prices, but the savings are a plus
3410 2018-05-15 16:59:44 Oil would topped@72.08$ and soon starts its southward journey towards 45.90$.
3411 2018-05-15 16:59:42 And then moisturize! It’s helped my oil control and keeps my skin hydrated and it’s minimized my breakouts! But only use the benzoyl at night unless you use an spf during the day
3412 2018-05-15 16:59:40 "personalized" snake oil  or "precision" snake oil :)
3413 2018-05-15 16:59:26 OIL 15M moves above 20MA, confirms higher, chart sets up, indicators set up bullish now near term. WATCH UWT ?
3414 2018-05-15 16:59:16 It's May shouldn't America be concerned with increasing the debt limit or bills Congress is passing, judicial nominees, cabinet agency major changes impacting Americans, discussing impact of increased oil on US trucking? @CNN @MSNBC NEWS should NOT mirror Access Hollywood
3415 2018-05-15 16:59:11 "Infrastructure and energy needs" are not the reasons we remain mired in oil.

The noxious greed of white men is the reason.

(Were the preceding sentence a 'Jeopardy' answer, imagine the difficulty selecting the correct answer from the nearly infinite possibilities.)
3416 2018-05-15 16:59:11 A ng cold just skeeted sesame oil all over himself 
3417 2018-05-15 16:59:07 WOW that's not true and you know it. This didn't start with the move to Jerusalem. This has been going on for 70 years but it only got worse over the decades as the zionists became more aggressive and racist. And the move only threw oil on the fire.
3418 2018-05-15 16:59:00 Desde que mandaron a quiebra a Oil y C5N quedó a la buena de Dios, ya no se corta ni se congela la imagen...

Quizás sea casualidad.
3419 2018-05-15 16:58:59 Put a drop of Peppermint Oil in the palm of one hand. Rub hands together. Cup hands over your  nose and mouth an breathe in thru your nose and out with your mouth. Repeat. Helps with both nausea and energy. Wash your hands :)
3420 2018-05-15 16:58:56 Coconut oil for either. Although - on your chest, it could stain your clothes. What even is your life right now? lol
3421 2018-05-15 16:58:45 Jordan B Peterson and the alt-right are like oil and water. You’re either incredibly stupid or just using “alt-right” to mean “people we don’t like.” Take your pick.
3422 2018-05-15 16:58:34 One key aspect of energy transitions is that they change the availability of energy. Normalizing to units of energy misses that the whale oil=> kerosene transition drastically increased overall energy consumption
3423 2018-05-15 16:58:33 LOL my oil changes are 300 so I would love to have a 90 dollar joint
3424 2018-05-15 16:58:21 First off: your ass is amazing!!! I love it!! I want it!! I want to oil it and hung it any chance I can !!! Now what happen to the arm?
3425 2018-05-15 16:58:09 ATTENTION IRAN!!!>
Please don’t fall for the fake reports by the zionist owned news channels to bait you into attacking Israel. The NWO just wants control of all the oil in the entire middle~east. The US/Israel govt.’s are complicit w this plan. @morphonios
3426 2018-05-15 16:58:05 Looking forward to finding out which international security firm they hired. Interesting that one op was named “Venezuela “, given their plight due to the low cost of oil and Russia’s mutual self-interest in the cost per barrel increasing...
3427 2018-05-15 16:58:03 Beard oil, but for chest hair...
3428 2018-05-15 16:57:51 $CDVE is the best growth and value play in the E&P oil sector. Analysts: 20 buy, 0 hold, 0 sell and a average price target of $27 actual price $19.50, and oil prices @$70 and Mr. Market pricing it at a @$55 oil price valuation. #TRMX #Bolsamx, #oil
3429 2018-05-15 16:57:40 She spent some time restringing her bow, giving it the oil it requires and reloading her quiver with some of the experimental arrows she has made.
3430 2018-05-15 16:57:40 Apply extra virgin olive oil using cotton bud/mascara brush. Works very well.
3431 2018-05-15 16:57:39 Whaaaaaat it helps for acne?!? What oil are you using? I might look into it
3432 2018-05-15 16:57:36 For Mothers day I took my sister to get her oil changed and her car checked out then took her my nephews and brother to see Infinity War I felt so complete
3433 2018-05-15 16:57:30 Lol he will when u start owning oil companies
3434 2018-05-15 16:57:24 Oil changes were like $90 he told me and I was like oh hell naw. I'm not ready for that lifestyle
3435 2018-05-15 16:57:17 Great. Let’s bring back people who muzzle scientists and work for the oil companies. 
Pathetic.
3436 2018-05-15 16:57:11 Pengen tapi gabisa gambar+gasuka gambar WKWKW tapi punya oil paintin jg dirumah yg tak terpakai bertahun tahun~~
3437 2018-05-15 16:57:03 If I don’t have the money to get an oil change PLEASE DONT BITCH AT ME FOR NOT GETTING AN OIL CHANGE BYE
3438 2018-05-15 16:57:02 Small sums of money are to be given to research various nuclear projects but not to select a single project to design and build.

This is why the economy is stagnanting government given up on growth. Hopefully the oil price will pick up and I can leave the nuclear industry.
3439 2018-05-15 16:57:02 I didn’t know how before, but always knew this presidency was all about Putin and trump in an oil deal
3440 2018-05-15 16:56:56 And that’s just for the actual barrel itself - not the oil it holds! Yup!
3441 2018-05-15 16:56:39 But it's what you got
3442 2018-05-15 16:56:38 My coworker gave me some tea tree oil for my face and now it’s all I smell 
3443 2018-05-15 16:56:28 He’s not exactly an oil painting himself 
3444 2018-05-15 16:56:24 Hey Robin, I see you like news! Well here's some: You're no oil painting sunshine. Have you crashed a number of cars without wearing a seatbelt?
3445 2018-05-15 16:55:56 Went to my uncles shop to get an oil change and tire fixed and it turned into lunch and margs at Barron’s with my uncle. I knew I was born into the right family 
3446 2018-05-15 16:55:52 CBD OIL!!!!!!!!!!!
3447 2018-05-15 16:55:30 It's all about fearmongering, and wanting others to "submit" to the profiteer and his ilk, who spews them with snake oil, from his bully pulpit. They need a double dose of Exodus 20.
3448 2018-05-15 16:55:20 Which 5 star review do you agree with?
Rosehip Triple C+E Firming Oil gives me life. After 3 weeks I can see a difference in the texture of my skin.
OR
I started using [Citrus & Kale Potent C+E Serum] 3 weeks ago and I LOVE it! The texture of my skin has never felt better...
3449 2018-05-15 16:55:16 Get some geranium oil, warming pillow and warming balm.
3450 2018-05-15 16:55:07 Hi @PeterAttiaMD, if I’m short about 50 grams of fat with 500 cals to spare what is the best way to achieve that goal? 4 tablespoons of olive oil seems like a bad idea...lol any suggestions?? I hit my protein and was within carbs from yesterday but struggled to make my fat goal
3451 2018-05-15 16:54:52 This is a very solid tip, you tend to lose the majority of your dream recollection 5-10 mins after waking. Try taking supplements like fish oil, it's good for the brain and will increase vividness/recollection of dreams, also smoking weed regularly tends to suppress your dreams.
3452 2018-05-15 16:54:51 for some countries, not all.  It is the policy of some national oil companies to replenish what they produced in the same year, hence the same number.
3453 2018-05-15 16:54:46 But mine also leaks oil like a bitch and only does it when it’s low.
3454 2018-05-15 16:54:41 OILは今日も楽しそうに飛び跳ねてんな
3455 2018-05-15 16:54:40 เรื่องเริ่มเข้าใกล้กูเข้าไปทุกที
3456 2018-05-15 16:54:32 all na packaging

Bt fr you,its a palm oil farm n groundnut oil depot
3457 2018-05-15 16:54:30 oil, question, est-ce qu'on peut connecter une scarlet i2i sur une ps4 ?
3458 2018-05-15 16:54:24 Lmfaoooooo RT @SheHatesJacoby: Women are known for managing their cars horribly... 1000 miles past due oil change, tires don't have anymore tread, etc
3459 2018-05-15 16:54:15 $USO oil spiking.
3460 2018-05-15 16:54:14 Gotta keep the guy who's the biggest threat to the oil in check.
3461 2018-05-15 16:54:14 Sweet boy!! That is good news he still wants to eat! Broccoli, kale, coconut oil, eggs, sardines, chicken broth, turmeric; all cancer fighters !! 
3462 2018-05-15 16:54:03 They're historic documents & they're not relevant. Because of your First Amendment you get idiots marketing snake oil as medicines & religious fanatics telling women abortion will make them infertile etc. this is the ME, not 18th century America. Sometimes it's not all about you.
3463 2018-05-15 16:54:03 So it was the US that had Chavez give oil away to every member state of the association of the Americas to maintain his international legitimacy. Or have heating oil to sent free to Cleveland - maduro was a bus driver. The us didn’t help
3464 2018-05-15 16:54:01 ทุกอย่างจบแล้ว... เรื่องของเราไม่มีอะไรค้างคากันอีก
3465 2018-05-15 16:53:58 Lmao I have but only when he ain’t being aggressive. When he in that mode like he was in last night tho just grab the blessed oil  and PRAY
3466 2018-05-15 16:53:56 I wonder if NAFTA uncertainty and steel/aluminum tariff nonsense have them worried about low margin products.

Of course, with the rest of Trump’s foreign policy, they should be worried about oil prices.
3467 2018-05-15 16:53:55 I wonder what kind of beard oil @BraunStrowman uses that I can get these hands on. #BeardGang
3468 2018-05-15 16:53:50 This reminds of when W was Gov Texas, he asked oil ind refinery EX's to write Texas environmental policy on cleaning and implementing regulations to fix environmental problems caused by the Oil Industry. Which was then adopted by Texas Lawmakers as state policy.
3469 2018-05-15 16:53:47 How about someone does something about the rising gas prices! Oil companies are one of the top crooks in this country! False reasons for raising gas prices.
3470 2018-05-15 16:53:43 I needed this oil change bad lol
3471 2018-05-15 16:53:43 Evangelicals. Just snake oil salesmen.
3472 2018-05-15 16:53:41 pink coconut oil lotion smell sooo good
3473 2018-05-15 16:53:38 Oil change or some type of problem with your oil that’s going to cause you to pull out your credit card  possibly once they tell you how much parts and labors are going to run you. #damitman
3474 2018-05-15 16:53:17 ยิ่งโตขึ้นเราก็ไม่ต้องการให้ใครมาสงสารหรือเห็นใจ เขาจะคิดยังไงเข้าใจแบบไหนก็แล้วแต่เขาเลย
3475 2018-05-15 16:53:07 the only thing worse than the smell of gear oil is the smell of gear oil on a hot day
3476 2018-05-15 16:53:05 Yep, can't afford to feed immigrants, but we can sure afford to subsidize Oil Corporations and march toward yet another war. Always money to bail out the big banks. Always money to pay the Military Industrial Complex...
3477 2018-05-15 16:53:04 What is E's exact deal in BB?  She's a robot with giant oil reserves in her chest?  Is she just all giant normals? Nothing else?
3478 2018-05-15 16:53:02 simple/senka oil cleansing.

3479 2018-05-15 16:52:54 ขออย่าละะ 
3480 2018-05-15 16:52:49 Even if there r no tariffs a fall in Sterling put up food and oil prices hence causing inflation. We are facing 5-10 years of rising costs, weak currency whilst still paying the EU. Seems like a pretty poor short to medium term future to me
3481 2018-05-15 16:52:35 Fak oil cleansing aku kat bilik mak aku 
3482 2018-05-15 16:52:33 เรื่องแตกนี่คนซวยเป็นกูเลยนะ
3483 2018-05-15 16:52:25 Bon bah y’a d’autres moyens de savoir après mais moins précis 
Y’a quelques avis qui divergent sur bi oil comme quoi ça serait pas super mais ma mère s’en ai servi pour sa grosses à ça a été hyper efficace
3484 2018-05-15 16:52:11 Take page fom the book of the world’s fifth largest oil exporter country
3485 2018-05-15 16:52:09 This is spiritual o, wasn't there anyone with anointing oil there?
3486 2018-05-15 16:52:09 Yes! I'm a bit of a beginner when it comes to oil, but I absolutely love working with it!
3487 2018-05-15 16:52:00 Not to worry. We're abot to wallow in our pride and oil over 200 year old injustices over in Norway. Let the world fix it self.
3488 2018-05-15 16:51:58 The fenty foundation and Laura mercier powder always keep me matte for a solid 5 hours after that a little bit of oil starts to peak through but even then it’s not a lot
3489 2018-05-15 16:51:57 Am a kannadiga believe me this alliance do not stand for long shikkakai and oil cannot stay long.
3490 2018-05-15 16:51:32 We give away our used fryer oil to some locals but we don't have their name or #...if you see this, we have lots of oil for you, please come and get it...
3491 2018-05-15 16:51:30 Environmentalists' decades-long anti-science fear-mongering campaign against #nuclearenergy is as responsible for our current #CO2 problem and #climatechange as the oil companies are.
3492 2018-05-15 16:51:29 Some girls' boyfriends bring them flowers or chocolates to work. Mine brings me a huge bottle of CBD oil to relieve my pain from this flare up. It's the little things 
3493 2018-05-15 16:51:24 I’m so glad I know people who keep peppermint oil at their desk
3494 2018-05-15 16:51:17 make sure they not boring nudes tho.. lingerie, heels, oil up, good pose.
3495 2018-05-15 16:51:06 So any product that contains teetree oil memang suit gila ah untuk muka aku
3496 2018-05-15 16:50:57 New Commission Idea:

A large oil painting of Abbott standing in a T-pose
3497 2018-05-15 16:50:52 that is pretty much how we are.  Don't you love it when a Christian tells you that a Jewish person is Anti Semitic. how moronic can they get...oh, I know.  By backing a lying snake oil salesman that would sell his own children out, if he thought he could make a buck. Even Ivanka
3498 2018-05-15 16:50:42 And I still ask why Trump's Rural loyalists sit by his side when he destroys their social services, helps coal and lets oil companies poison their air and water. President Obama did more for Rural Americans than Trump ever will.
3499 2018-05-15 16:50:18 hi bb just make sure you use hair masks that are rich in keratin (coconut oil does pretty much nothing) & use a conditioner that ensures moisture! your curls will be fine 
3500 2018-05-15 16:50:15 @KrazyEssentials makes@a really good dry oil that has some really age appropriate scents and shades of shimmer. Use code “SheenBalla” when you checkout for an extra discount 
3501 2018-05-15 16:50:11 I think they excuse them every day. This is just excuse of the week.
3502 2018-05-15 16:50:00 How much oil you have purchased?
3503 2018-05-15 16:49:55 fucking howling at ellie using cooking oil on herself in the sun today to tan the spacka 
3504 2018-05-15 16:49:53 Sorry. I hate oil in my food
3505 2018-05-15 16:49:52 最近あんガルの再リメイクの夢を見る……ううう((T_T))

@bulletproofexec what would be the healthiest oil to deep fry my chips? I use a temp of 180C-190C.
3508 2018-05-15 16:49:47 My brain is deffo deteriorating into a pile of useless tissues. Might need some beaten egg, salt & pepper and a pan with hot oil to make it into a delicacy. Yes I’m talking abt otak goreng soto kudus #sorrynotsorry
3509 2018-05-15 16:49:40 No, he’s not. How many bankruptcies has he had? Failed casinos? Lawsuits for not paying contractors? Lawsuits for fraud? He’s a snake oil salesmen and a con.
3510 2018-05-15 16:49:38 Our acne kit, which consists of a wash/toner and scrub is 7000.

A vitamin c serum (50ml)  and brightening body oil ( 100ml) for your glow up costs 6000.
3511 2018-05-15 16:49:32 catch me at non-comm fest offering ppl some of my cbd oil to compensate for my overwhelming social anxiety
3512 2018-05-15 16:49:28 Wasn't sure if I would like the smell of the beard oil and I don't know all of the ingredients in them.
3513 2018-05-15 16:49:26 And they can't even afford their own billboard - Oil changes? ;)
3514 2018-05-15 16:49:25 left mustard oil in a pot unattended
3515 2018-05-15 16:49:20 no lease covers wear n tear the most you'll get is free oil changes, n with the lease you can't even drive the car as much as you want

3521 2018-05-15 16:48:54 The world has moved on since 1707, Eddi. I mean, if you want to go further back, Scotland was a number of "States", so, it all depends on your starting point! You surely woouldnt want to give the Angles and Picts a share of all that oil.
3522 2018-05-15 16:48:51 Why is the whole twitter Nigeria acting as if delta state is not part of Nigeria,...with huge fed allocations and big state budget, what about fed reps and senators, now oil is booming yet Delta state government  has nothing to show. 
@WarriUpdate @BudgITng @Kpoko1005FM @Normofe
3523 2018-05-15 16:48:50 make sure the hair is really long! it will hurt a whole bunch the first time but you will get used to it. have oil or lotion or something to put on your skin afterwards.

3533 2018-05-15 16:48:09 It’s shown that CBD oil will work better the treatments
3534 2018-05-15 16:47:53 In 2010, a rig in the Gulf of Mexico experienced a catastrophic collapse resulting in the largest accidental oil spill in history.

An incompetent Obama Adminstration, charged with inspecting the rig, took five months to stop it.

3548 2018-05-15 16:45:54 that teacher is dumb... medical marijuana gets you high but CBD oil doesn’t and that’s the medical shit they use for kids with seizures and patients who dont want to get high. so technically that holds some truth bc the oil doesnt have THC and it’s used as medicine, but just no

3574 2018-05-15 16:42:59 That' the logic of Brexit too. The EU would want access to the oil and gas, as well as our large marketplace. You'd think you'd be pleased to be part of such a thing. Dont forget, oil and gas is a declining (fast if the Greens get their way) resource, whereas, the rest is ongoing

3585 2018-05-15 16:42:24 Urgente. Esto no tiene nombre: en medio de esta crisis, Vzla ha comprado petróleo por más de $ 400 m/m para prestarlos a Cuba, pagaderos en cómodas cuotas. Acá el link. Exclusive: As Venezuelans suffer, Maduro buys foreign oil to subsidize Cuba. Eso no es traición a la patria?

3590 2018-05-15 16:42:01 Saskatchewan economy is resource based and strongly correlated to commodity prices.  Oil is one of many drivers with pulse crop, potash, and uranium prices all affecting well paying jobs.  To say this does not affect broad economy or to say oil is not important is false.

3648 2018-05-15 16:35:18 I suppose the US could technically maintain the low oil prices of the last few years IF oil producers sold a lot of oil (eg old wells, shale oil, offshore oil, Alaskan oil) at nearly zero profit or a loss.

3687 2018-05-15 16:30:39 I saw lots of the footage-the Palestinians were armed I saw guns I saw huge gas or oil canisters being set alight. I saw lots of Molotov cocktails. The IDF footage suggests they were returning fire when shot at by Gaza side. I think it depends on what media outlet you watch.

3695 2018-05-15 16:30:05 Rising interest rates
Rising Crude oil prices
Added fiscal deficit
3696 2018-05-15 16:30:04 Yeah keep telling yourself that, reality is still the same. What they and dozens of other articles show is reality is very different than narrative. A quick peak at Venezuela who yup has socialist controlled oil to boot confirms that
3697 2018-05-15 16:29:59 I salt and pepper your tweet, then sauté them in olive oil and sprinkle some sesame seeds just before serving :)

3699 2018-05-15 16:29:41 Actually, clean air & water are in everyone's interest! An investigation of climate-change science reveals a situation that negates mere economic considertions. We simply cannot continue along the same path. Good news is there are many alternatives to oil.
3700 2018-05-15 16:29:38 So gmo mustard is developed by Indian scientists and would replace the huge oil import bill. There are no irregularities here, just sad that Indian farmers cannot benefit from this technology and improved incomes. Why do non- players feel free to comment on this...

3716 2018-05-15 16:28:02 We recognize there’s a global shift in energy production; the transition to a low emission future is happening. That transition won’t happen overnight – oil and gas will continue to play an essential role in our lives and economy for some time.

3719 2018-05-15 16:27:39 Hmm, Eric seems to be ignorant of recent native American protests against a private oil company building a pipeline (already leaking) under their fresh water reserve.  The only shootings there, also, were against the protesters
3720 2018-05-15 16:27:37 Oil for the most part.
3721 2018-05-15 16:27:37 To stop even more whining...I’m not confusing the two, I’m talking about global consumption. If we are exporting then the end user is getting cleaner oil, simple
3722 2018-05-15 16:27:36 Snake oil salesmen have been duping Americans of all backgrounds and education levels for as long as there's been a republic. Trump supporters are no different. Embarassed for being duped. However there is a remedy.  #vote2018

3731 2018-05-15 16:27:03 That’s how big oil’s marketing and margins strategy works.  The new (still high and profitable) average price seems like a bargain vs., the ginormous mark-up and rip-off of $1.37 - $1.60 depending on geography.
3732 2018-05-15 16:27:02 あぁ、なるほど確かに…

3751 2018-05-15 16:24:41 No. In 1951 Iran elected it first prime minister, the secular Dr. Mossadegh. He wanted to nationalize the iranian oil, but MI6 and CIA orchestrated a coup and the son of the Shah returned. The west didnt help the regime come to power in 1979. They fucked us over in 53

3794 2018-05-15 16:20:17 Fun fact: Unlike almost all currencies in the world, the value of the American dollars isn't based on a physical resource such as gold, oil, etc.

The dollar has value because the government says it has value and upheld by America being America and the dollar being traded.

3819 2018-05-15 16:18:43 palm oil should be banned full stop,it pollutes the environment ,is extremely poisonous to many animals,it is polluting beaches all around the world.
3820 2018-05-15 16:18:36 To the ones creating this chaos, it's about oil. To the end-timers, it's about prophesy.

3824 2018-05-15 16:18:22 I once talked to this guy who had the nerve to lie to me about things I already knew weren’t true and he really thought he was slick as BP oil

3826 2018-05-15 16:17:53 Uranium stocks are taking it on the chin today. So if you believe that new trend is emerging in uranium prices, now is a great day to buy. That said, the two picks I gave SCI subscribers were in drones/high tech and oil.  Because we want to ride those trends, too. #TooManyChoices

3839 2018-05-15 16:16:41 I hate every time I get a oil change they always come back telling me I need more stuff fixed, like just change the oil that I paid for already
3840 2018-05-15 16:16:38 Crude oil prices have constantly rising, breaching $80/bbl now.

But inflation is still at double digit levels, unemployment is high and naira/$ exchange rates are still all over the place.

These problems have more to do with bad economic policies than crude oil prices.
3841 2018-05-15 16:16:34 Thanks to this heat wave, there is so much oil on my sweaty forehead that I'm afraid of starting an inter-provincial pipeline dispute. @ElizabethMay, @kennedystewart, little help?
3842 2018-05-15 16:16:23 To be fair, gas and oil prices were rising prior to Trump breaking the JCPOA, but they most likely will continue to rise now.

3859 2018-05-15 16:14:26 no,no, Russia will veto this all day long, conflict in the middle east means higher oil prices,  which makes Russian oil more competitive.

3872 2018-05-15 16:12:48 negative articles on @Tesla collisions are an obvious propaganda tactic. The amount of fatalities in a Tesla is less than a fraction of a % of their cars on the road (%0.006 from the data I found) big oil is scared of @elonmusk because he is succeeding at a better tech.
3873 2018-05-15 16:12:46 It would be real and believed by the masses if it reflected on the prices of foodstuffs. I would believe if the prices of rice, yam, oil, meat, fish etc were reduced. We need evidence not words of mouth.
3874 2018-05-15 16:12:44 yes; Josh's partnership with M&S came to an end and we don't have a replacement as a part of our Josh Wood Colour range yet! We recommend giving Redken Diamond Oil a go as a suitable replacement :) Thanks!

3879 2018-05-15 16:12:12 To clarify: cheese is the major issue for me.  I can still generally handle butter, but stuff high in it gives me indigestion like any other dairy.  Light olive oil is usually what I use at home, since it's not overpowering like extra virgin.

3883 2018-05-15 16:11:23 It would be really satisfying if we could just take our spine out, oil it, crack it and then put it back.
3884 2018-05-15 16:11:21 Dreamt I was driving on a long highway over vast water on either side, and there were huge rotting whale and sea monster carcasses/skeletons floating/peeking out of the waves as they lapped. It was terrifying. The ocean was black like oil & a storm was brewing in the sky

3892 2018-05-15 16:10:27 China is becoming #1 in the world. Where the U.S.dropped the ball on renewable energy, China wrapped her arms around it & are leading the way.

3905 2018-05-15 16:08:51 I thought I was being responsible by getting my oil changed but then the mechanics saw a bunch of problems I don't even understand and that's how life feels
3906 2018-05-15 16:08:51 Well the that's a very classic economic effect you will see with any cartel or group which requires cooperation, there are too many reward to be had by cheating.  It's why OPEC can't keep it's members from producing more oil than their quota.
3907 2018-05-15 16:08:47 Kids don’t even know chips come from potatoes. As for making chips, it’s far easier to cut up some potato wedges, I microwave for 6 minutes, before oven, throw in olive oil, season, with whatever, they’re tasty, quite healthy, & you can’t burn the house down. Cheap too.
3908 2018-05-15 16:08:45 Indeed and so much for the Balfour declaration earlier The British not to upset the Arabs due to their oil took their side

3914 2018-05-15 16:08:20 Ah ok. I use a few of their eyeliners and I have very oily lids. I usually prime or conceal and I'm fine. However most of my oil stays in the crease so it never bothers my eyeliner

3920 2018-05-15 16:07:43 Oil and gas are a finite resource that is coming to the end of is cycle. You are delaying the inevitable conversion to renewable energy and threatening planetary eco system for cash. Air and water trumps oil and gas.
3921 2018-05-15 16:07:41 Unfortunately Weaver and Horgan oblivious to the many BC residents also working in Alberta oil sands and related industries.
3922 2018-05-15 16:07:35 If it was a capitalist regime, it would still not do anything since oil prices going down would still crush the economy, much like how you have all the little mining towns in the US be in the crapper once the mining was done and nothing was left
3923 2018-05-15 16:07:30 @almackenzie Hi There I know supermarkets don't have the greatest track records but Iceland have made a promise to stop using palm oil in their products this year sadly the only one at the moment.

3963 2018-05-15 16:03:15 Its bad luck that attempts to repeal CAFE coincide with the highest oil prices in three years. Its almost like US drilling can't set global prices and energy security measures still matter
3964 2018-05-15 16:03:11 Clothes with the highlighter? Cause I figure the oil shouldn't be damaging.
3965 2018-05-15 16:03:10 The poor souls have been fighting since their existence. I remember growing up hearing Yasser Arrafat and the PLO scrimmaging the Gaza strip. The Isrealis are a strong people. We wont let anything happen to them. No ones running to our side bc they have bad investments in oil.

3991 2018-05-15 16:00:29 Quick facts about Utah's energy from @EIAgov - Oil production tripled from 2003 to 2014 and, although it then declined as crude oil prices fell, production in 2016 was still more than twice what it had been in 2003. #UtEnergySummit

3993 2018-05-15 16:00:22 Hillary openly criticized Putin. Putin also knew she’d never lift sanctions which have to lift for Russia to do big oil deals with the US. Trump hasn’t been able to yet but he’s been trying actively since the moment he was sworn in. Look at his initial choice of Tillerson too.

4008 2018-05-15 15:59:09 Israel occupied Gaza after the 6-day war; they pumped out all the oil reserves and then “turned over” what was left of the territory to the Palestinians. Over a million and a half people “live” there with no jobs, no way out, and no hope.

4033 2018-05-15 15:57:16 At present, I prefer to keep 20% cash. The rising dollar and crude oil are putting pressure on the fiscal deficit. The high liquidity which is supporting the market can reduce with the rising inflation and there is a possibility of interest rate hike.

4058 2018-05-15 15:55:04 $50 for an oil change 
4059 2018-05-15 15:54:57 Really know how you feel. But trust me it will get better eventually you will find something that works. Try baby oil after showering. 🖒
4060 2018-05-15 15:54:53 facts price don't really mean shit if you can't afford car parts n $120 oil changes
4061 2018-05-15 15:54:49 Doesn't answer the question. USA is producing more oil now than it did in the 1970s. What oil we do import mostly comes from Canada, Nigeria, Venezuela, and Russia.

If Donnie can take credit for the economy that has been expanding for the last 4 years, he should also...
4062 2018-05-15 15:54:48 Is it definitely the same oil? PDVSA needs to import light sweet crude just to get its own heavy sour oil out of the ground. Venezuelan oil too heavy to pump on its own.
4063 2018-05-15 15:54:45 I hear put out after lotion so it seams moisture. Can one use coconut oil instead of the baby oil?
4064 2018-05-15 15:54:40 Why am I buying engine oil and not simply using the copious oil from my face
4065 2018-05-15 15:54:34 Yup. That's the official story on BS. On the oil bit, are you going to walk everywhere you go? Are you not going to heat or cool your home? And don't forget the reason sanctions were enacted to begin with. You're correct. If Hitlary would've won, there wouldn't have been sanction
4066 2018-05-15 15:54:30 It would be great to see more cross aisle work on opportunities that make sense. NEB rulebook changes didn’t help Energy East. Who knows - maybe we’ll get another shot at replacing US & foreign oil in eastern Canada at some point. The competitive environment would need to change.

4084 2018-05-15 15:53:04 Lard from pastured pork is very healthy..it's largely oleic fatty acid, the same fatty acid in olive oil. So they're being a bit subjective as to what constitutes being "healthy" & what should be excluded. A lot of corn isn't healthy. Amaranth on the other hand should b a staple.
4085 2018-05-15 15:52:55 You and I dont ignore it. But mainstream media is full of articles about global warming but very little reporting us done on environmental chaos big oil left in South America. And when is the last time you read an article on the worst nuclear disaster in human history?

4098 2018-05-15 15:51:25 From experience, using oil clearing face-wash up there is associated with greater chances of sunburn (which skin oils protect against). Use something simpler like soap instead maybe.

4148 2018-05-15 15:46:34 Russia’s main source of money is oil. Oil prices were crazy low. War in the Middle East raises oil prices significantly. Russia profits billions. Pretty straight forward imo.
4149 2018-05-15 15:46:31 Michael Cohen- reread the Steele Dossier that talks about Cohen & Russian Oil company sold 19.5% to Qatar & now has bought back most of it. How it was done was to create SLUSH FUND & that money is now on Mueller’s Radar. Money has to wake up & speed ->
4150 2018-05-15 15:46:04 And of course both those methods might work better if you poured some oil or something around the plug first in an attempt to lubricate it a bit?

4159 2018-05-15 15:45:47 Omg you idiots are so funny, first the Bush's were starting wars in middle east so we could take their oil. I ain't no rich sheik, yet.

4160 2018-05-15 15:45:35 Can't figure out why after 4 nonstop years of photoshop and maybe one oil painting every 3 months, my digital work looks better than my oils
4161 2018-05-15 15:45:20 I don’t actually. I do know that we have the most stringent environmental controls than anywhere else and Canada is a carbon sink and you guys still want to shut it down. There is definitely a point where it’s economical suicide not to monetize our oil.
4162 2018-05-15 15:45:12 The global market for fish oil omega-3 is projected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2011 to $1.7 billion by 2018.

4173 2018-05-15 15:44:32 Oh and be sure to moisturize (crazy I know) but use an oil free moisturizer after you wash your face and you’ll be Gucci 
4174 2018-05-15 15:44:28 Businesses have generally liked Modi's economic policies at the center, and they believe a BJP loss in Karnataka would weaken his hand for 2019. Other factors have also contributed to a weak rupee lately, including rising oil prices, which hurt India's economy.
4175 2018-05-15 15:44:19 Ah, fair...though the distinction (when its used against a specific population or demographic) can be rather hazy. "You suck oil!" Might be an insult, but "oil-suckers" is probably a slur

4224 2018-05-15 15:39:28 With dau I’ve found miralax didn’t help if she’s already backed up. Daily when she’s moving normal. Also if you can stomach mineral oil even Flax oil.

4227 2018-05-15 15:39:18 “But doesn’t the oil burn? How can you like hurting him?” Mam asked.

“It doesn’t burn like fire, more like spices in your mouth. What I’m doing is helping him heal faster,” Tindra said.

4230 2018-05-15 15:39:05 Yeah that's not cool at all. I've never had any problems with Kia  they fixed my oil pan cuz my warranty covered it, but I've only had to take it in for regular oil changes and whatnot and if there's a problem they let me know and I just being it in and don't have to pay
4231 2018-05-15 15:39:01 With oil this stubborn & with their ability to control the market with ease, there won't be one gold miner in business soon.
4232 2018-05-15 15:38:41 Btw... This knock off Versace oil is on point.
4233 2018-05-15 15:38:38 So if you’re wondering why Iran is screwed up and hostile to the West, it’s because the West has a history of putting the boot in them for the sake of cheap oil. /6
4234 2018-05-15 15:38:35 Since the fall of the Ottoman Empire in 1922, the West has been obsessed with the Middle East.... land-grabbing, oil, religion, blah blah....

4239 2018-05-15 15:38:08 What's with $70/bbl oil in the US? I'm told our shale producers can make money at $40/bbl. Let's do it! Do an accommodation with the Saudis; they should match us and we all take Russians to the wall!
4240 2018-05-15 15:38:06 This is the height of corruption despite the price of crude oil in international markets, National Assembly Increases 2018 Budget To N9.1trn. How? What??

4241 2018-05-15 15:37:58 focusing on the work he has in hand. When the oil is ready, he slowly puts the pieces of meat in the pan one by one, and the sizzling sound can be heard.
4242 2018-05-15 15:37:45 What's your money ? Do you contribute to it ? You really think you aren't living off oil money too ? Bank money ? Biggest club in debt in Europe ? Idiots
4243 2018-05-15 15:37:38 A small smile is formed on his lips as he busies himself with cutting the meat into smaller pieces while waiting for the oil to be ready to use. "You can always find me whenever you're in heat, so you wont have to hump any pillow." He chuckles, glancing back at you shortly before

Save some money and use laundry dryer sheets can be used to remove dust from appliances and floors.

Tip #2
Gym bag has a musty smell. Put a few drops of your favourite essential oil. Let it sit over night. No more musty smell.

4247 2018-05-15 15:37:00 Thanks Roberto - I appreciate your insight. I don't claim to be an expert, I just 'know' what I see. Both sides are guilty, as are the supporters of both sides. YES it's always about money (oil/power), and always led by superpowers (USA/Rus), as in history...
4248 2018-05-15 15:36:57 #FLAME: There is an abundance of oil, not all of which be produced. This will bring prices back down to $60/b after 2020
4249 2018-05-15 15:36:54 @TheTrivShow  I object to Lanigan's ignorance on the topic of oil company profits.  Oil companies cut cost over the past 3 years due to lower oil prices and losses incurred.  When prices finally increase, of course the profits will be great due to cuts made.
4250 2018-05-15 15:36:28 The overuse of coconut oil, right?! 
4251 2018-05-15 15:36:17 Iran is that not one of the few countries whose central bank isnt Rothchilds?

If they drop the dollar standard for oil too , just like Iraq and Libya did.

4260 2018-05-15 15:35:37 I have a feeling #ANGS is about to move nice and steady with new highs by end of summer. Rig onsite and ESP being put in, more oil at almost $80pb = ££££ rig then onto balcombe? Then brockham with any luck should be a great year. Target slice 30p unless it rockets, low float
4261 2018-05-15 15:35:36 Swab your nose w coconut oil. That cold will be gone in no time. In the mean time 2-6 oz of scotch, and some hot lemon water and ibuprofen.
4262 2018-05-15 15:35:33 You may be wasting your time. Reason and Trump are like oil and water. And I am someone who has a lot of time for some of his actions like ramping up prosecution of sex traffickers

4265 2018-05-15 15:34:52 That sounds good, doesn’t it?

Well, it didn’t sound good to the United Kingdom, which was accustomed to extracting oil from Iran as they pleased and paying a pittance in return. /3

4268 2018-05-15 15:34:43 When it rains, runoff enter waterways picking up soil, fertilizer, oil, pesticides & contaminants. This increases algae growth in lakes, alters fish habitat and  can make lakes dangerous for recreational activities. Invest in a rain barrel to reduce runoff #ecopledge

4273 2018-05-15 15:33:50 Anirban, how do you see green energy impacting oil prices over short (next 1-2 years) and middle term (5-7 years)?
4274 2018-05-15 15:33:43 It’s not because “Islam is incompatible with democracy” or something like that.

It’s because the Iranian government wanted to control its oil exports and use the revenues to fund infrastructure, healthcare, education, etc. /2

4277 2018-05-15 15:33:23 Shit the only thing that would make today better would be oil being up 5 bucks and gasoline ripping higher.

4284 2018-05-15 15:32:37 Actually Iran is a nation full of people with real needs. When it gets involved in the Middle East it’s because those are its neighbors and not because they want their oil.
4285 2018-05-15 15:32:35 Also try Jamaican black castor oil

4296 2018-05-15 15:31:19 Gas went up because of the Iran sanctions, and the fact that there is no pipeline deals. So our excess oil is sitting on a field and can't get anywhere causing a rise in prices.

4341 2018-05-15 15:26:14 That is not true,  the Venezuelan crisis was created  between the VENEZUELAN  Government and  the Cuban.

4391 2018-05-15 15:21:05 The American people are paying more at the pump than at any point in the past 4 years. Oil prices are their highest level in the past 3 1/2 years. Maybe what's "booming" are #OilandGas industry profits. #EnergyDominance is a scam and coming at the expense of our #publiclands.

4394 2018-05-15 15:20:46 C'mon David. You aren't new to this. You KNOW that is how things work in the 'renewables' space... Palm oil. Drax. Silly feed in tariffs. Gas Cos promoting W+S and lobbying for closure of nukes, etc, etc... There is neither concern for the environment or the poor.
4395 2018-05-15 15:20:38 We saw  this crisis coming so many years ago, nobody listened. Many  thought it was due to the rich in Venezuela being against the "revolution", but the true is that the chavismo bankrupted the Country. A Country can not kill the productive sector and fully depend  on Oil.
4396 2018-05-15 15:20:35 That's sound like a lot of oil
4397 2018-05-15 15:20:28 So get 
1. Oil price up for Putin - check
2. Make China Great Again - check

Good premise for a fake "deal" with North Korea I should say. 

Clearly Trump thinks the NK "deal" is already in the bag. Wonder why...
4398 2018-05-15 15:20:23 This incredible product has greatly improved my health.  I've been using it for 3 months now treating my diabetes.  CBD OIL is the truth in wellness and healing.  I'm a product of the product because I'm also an Independent Associate with CTFO and my company is hiring.

4414 2018-05-15 15:18:36 I didn’t take any cbd oil and my body is aching and I just took other meds so will have to wait two hours now to take (tried taking at the same time which I didn’t realise you’re not supposed to do and it made me worse lol)
4415 2018-05-15 15:18:36 No collusion with Russia? You never said mate!! Just because news is negative against you doesn’t mean it’s fake. Bet you are still not as rich as Mr Bezos? Oh and thanks for getting the price of oil up. Filling a car cost more. Ow as a result of your fake ness with Iran.

4429 2018-05-15 15:16:05 Every statement in your tweet is wrong. The pipeline will carry BITUMEN not oil, which we don’t use everyday cos it can’t be refined in Canada. Bitumen is safer carried by rail as undiluted it won’t flow (it’s tar) and not flammable so if it derails, it won’t spill or burn

I just paid $2.49 a gal or $.63 per liter for gas which probably came from oil shipped from Canada. On the weekend visiting TO I paid  $1.39 per liter or 5.56 per gal.  Really!

4515 2018-05-15 15:07:45 Missionaries tell us that every member of Christ's body is a minister.

4539 2018-05-15 15:05:41 Saute it lightly, for literally 4 mins at MOST, with olive oil and garlic. Must be crunchy. Soft asparagus is utter death. I stirfry it with red peppers, garlic and courgette, stir some spinach in at the last minute and serve on top of pasta w a dollop of fresh pesto & parmesan.
4540 2018-05-15 15:05:37 I do sadly think that if any intelligence gets to Putin, Nunes, Trump or #GOPutin mob cartel that took govt over in 2017, it will be used to kill Bob, blame Iran, start #IranWar for generations of tragedy & #ShiaGenocide in the Gulf (where they are majority & sit on the oil).

4546 2018-05-15 15:05:03 It doesn't fit with the narrative- dems protect the environment which means restricting oil production at home

4560 2018-05-15 15:03:58 undercooked potatoes is a crime. They take a long time to cook in a pan raw. When I make homefries, I will put them in the microwave for a few minutes to cook and dehydrate them a bit, then fry them in oil until they are golden. reduces the cooking time by a lot.

4770 2018-05-15 14:43:21 Why haven't any bodies been recovered? In a catastrophic accident involving aircraft, water acts like concrete.  Disintegration of part of the plane invariably follows.  Debris, oil, gas, bodies drift about.

4808 2018-05-15 14:39:16 Who increases the tax?
Oil companies or central govt? 2014, excise duty on diesel was Rs 3.56 and petrol was Rs 9.48; Since then, it has been revised 11 times during the last 4 years. From Rs 3.56 per to Rs 17.33 per over 380% & petrol from Rs 9.48 per litre to 21.48 per!
4809 2018-05-15 14:38:57 Oil has create a sense of entitlement, nay, a neurosis that one is not getting any of the"action" instead of creating value.
4810 2018-05-15 14:38:57 I know, but hondas supposedly have really good rear mains, its might not be that. I heard they like to leak around the valve cover, oil filter, and spark plug tubes - and its all mostly due to lack of oil changes
Obviously I'm flying blind here lol sorry for spitballing

I wont be surprised if you are thick enough to fall for that
4813 2018-05-15 14:38:48 Sure. Alaska was completely stolen by the righteous reich & oil oligarchs. Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi are fiefdoms.

4814 2018-05-15 14:38:43 If u think this isn’t part of the Trump calculus, then ur more naive than anyone thought! Compare today’s oil prices with those in 2015-16. It’s all about profits not Americans first. If this is Makeing America Great Again, let’s not be “so great!” Trump & the billionaires club!
4815 2018-05-15 14:38:34 Why is it so easy to spend money on things I don’t need but when it comes to getting my oil changed I feel like as if spending this money is gunna kill me

Everything you have provided is going to oil companies.

4833 2018-05-15 14:36:02 The country with more oil and one of the largest producers in the world ends up buying oil and gasoline among others from its "friends Russia and Iran" that were supposed to help it become a world power, but now we do not have enough to cover the basic needs.

4836 2018-05-15 14:35:41 there's a technique that goes along with using bha and charcoal masks which is called "gritting" and it's where you basically massage the dirt out of your pores with a cleansing oil ! also maybe look into dermarolling! good luck!! pores are the actual worst ://
4837 2018-05-15 14:35:39 Egypt once refused to recognize the state of Israel and longed to destroy the tiny Jewish nation. However, they have made peace with one another, Israel even gave the entire oil rich Sinai to their former enemy. It proves Israel can strike a deal for peace, but Hamas can't

4842 2018-05-15 14:35:28 Don't put your words in to my mouth. I didn't say anything like that. Oil companies increased price.both center and state gets increased share of tax. All that isaac does is just blame center. If he is so concerned, reduce his tax share and pass on the benefit.

4846 2018-05-15 14:35:01 What makes this worse, is while they are waiting for this decision, they continue to sell their snake oil philosophy & further endanger others.  Throw the full extent of the law at them & hopefully find a way to silence them!

4898 2018-05-15 14:30:19 I dont think so. That would be very bad for the economy. But oil 65-70 is very bullish for the equities. Oil just has to hold this range for the sector to do very very well.

5021 2018-05-15 14:18:21 I’m a native Houstonian as well. The racism there is structural in polite society (mid-upper class) but I met several racist white kids from tougher backgrounds. I did meet one rich kid in hs who didn’t like black ppl.
Live in Amarillo now; it’s pretty racist out here.
5022 2018-05-15 14:18:16 May we ask what your favorite brand of Lemon essential oil is?
5023 2018-05-15 14:18:10 It was a mix of olive oil, Dijon mustard, minced garlic, a little thyme/sage/black peppercorns. Seared on the stove and finished in the oven until 150 degrees internally. I don’t use any recipe storage.
5024 2018-05-15 14:18:08 this is weird - i’ve never been presented liquid coffee mate in place of dairy in any scenario/ only ever even see the powdered form in hotel rooms.  

... but yes, close enough to paint. it’s all hydrogenated vegetable oil.
5025 2018-05-15 14:18:04 It’s probably in my head but I feel like my car drives so much better after I get my oil changed. 
5026 2018-05-15 14:17:47 Bala-bala yang digoreng pake canola sunflower oil rasanya gimana, ya?
5027 2018-05-15 14:17:47 How about unemployment if 3.9% in US where energy booming. Investment in Canada flat despite $70 oil. Zero pipelines in construction while globally infrastructure expanding...need more?
5028 2018-05-15 14:17:39 Legality of CBD oil has zero to do with religion. Even if you could get high, I still don't see any correlation. During prohibition, did all those lost souls go straight to hell because of laws man made?
5029 2018-05-15 14:17:39 Yes. Electricity prices hv always been controlled by govt. Whereas fuel prices are said to be controlled by the oil companies without any interference by govt. That's the only but big difference.
5030 2018-05-15 14:17:38  aaaaaaaah thank u my bubble bunny, I thread them myself! castor oil makes them grow more consistently too
5031 2018-05-15 14:17:36 We just throw it in the oven with some oil salt and pepper. Always turns out great
5032 2018-05-15 14:17:15 foot oil
5033 2018-05-15 14:17:14 Very difficult. I listen to how these traditional companies make that extraction possible. I think of an oil rig in the middle of the ocean as a parallel.
5034 2018-05-15 14:17:11 That's so weird. Literally earlier today I got a promoted tweet in Arabic about a pilgrimage to Mecca. And another encourage me to drill for oil in Israel.
5035 2018-05-15 14:16:58 Also, that James Clapper is on caught on T.V. saying the CIA manipulates Oil prices as part of it's tool kit to sow Radical Discontent in nations they want to overthrow. Economic Warfare is one of the more open tools. They also use Microwave and Frequency Weapons on entire areas.

Accumulate vast wealth, leaving 80% of the population living on less than $10 a day;
Monetise health services;
Promote formula milk to breast feeding mothers in the developing world;
Conduct tar-sands oil production; 
So... y’know.

5049 2018-05-15 14:15:08 Y'all should quit applying petroleum jelly and baby oil and saying it's the American sun or face glow 
5050 2018-05-15 14:14:55 Don’t use marinara sauce, get a can of puréed tomatoes and some fresh garlic, fresh basil, oregano and balsamic. Lightly sauté the garlic in olive oil (like ten seconds) add the tomatoes and everything else and that’s it.
5051 2018-05-15 14:14:43 Also CBD oil needs to be made widely available and taken seriously. I guess when big pharma figures out how to monopolize & make billions off it, it will be an option for everyone. The corporations who own this country value profit over lives.
5052 2018-05-15 14:14:33 your time is coming, and you are not getting the oil commission you negotiated.
5053 2018-05-15 14:14:25 Here's the real tragedy:
Canada produces 4 million barrels/day of oil, sells 3M BPD to USA @ big discount but then imports 1M BPD to E Coast).  The combo of  exporting @ big discount and importing @ Top world prices LOSES the CDN economy about $30 billion/yr.  CDN's R Fools

5057 2018-05-15 14:14:07 Isn’t that the MO of anyone in power? Power Corp, or Canada Steamship Lines are two obvious examples on home court. There’s also Crime Minister Harper’s service to Big Oil.

5064 2018-05-15 14:13:01 Yes! For those that don’t want the high from THC the hemp oil has many benefits. It has made a difference in my life, not just the pain but other things. Bonus, no side effects like you hear with the medications advertised. It’s awesome its made a difference in your life!
5065 2018-05-15 14:12:57 #oil price  - the 20% move in the #WTIoilprice this year will slow down the US  - more importantly the biggest beneficiary of  Oil is Putin who will be able to afford far more weapons  well done #Trump double own goal / home run

5071 2018-05-15 14:11:59 much needed oil change after work
5072 2018-05-15 14:11:54 Bottom line here is that all these crooks recently invested heavily in Russian oil & look what happened to the price of gas.

5075 2018-05-15 14:11:35 We agree with most of these observations but the the oil price is also influenced by the reserves, which seem to be growing simply because of falling demand. There are also signs that Russia mobilizes traditional friends in terror like Zawahiri to remind of the Al-Qaeda threat.

5100 2018-05-15 14:09:21 "Data is the new oil." I hear the term from traditional Backup and Storage companies. The battle to explain value results in terms such as Hyper-Availability. Its's extremely difficult to package in a "Data is the new oil" statement. #VeeamOn

5152 2018-05-15 14:04:14 Here’s my worry. Whatever deal the owners worked out with Huw, probably has given Huw too much decision making power. These guys are bad owners. We have nearly a decade of evidence in the US of Levian being a terrible front office exec. He’s a snake oil salesman
5153 2018-05-15 14:04:11 okay oil field, I know you’re doing good right now but gas prices are going up and the earthquakes are a litttttttle much

5155 2018-05-15 14:03:59 Trump wants to raise gas prices so that tar-sands oil and shale oil can be extracted at a profit.  It is all about oil and money.
5156 2018-05-15 14:03:57 No No.  Hamas want your oil.
5157 2018-05-15 14:03:55 What has Iran got to do with killing innocent Palestinians. Every nation and leaders of the world should be condemning these attacks starting with USA. No excuses for killing the innocent. Regardless how much oil price goes up or down.
5158 2018-05-15 14:03:44 That's certainly what I remember them being called as a kid out west. Anyway, how is "oil sands" softer than "tar sands?" Neither term conjures up images of puppy dogs and rainbows.

5185 2018-05-15 14:01:43 That's probably planned for the "after-oil-era".
5186 2018-05-15 14:01:35 I don't care about the oil but the fact that you think that one should not be shamed or have guilt, is ridiculous.
Guilt is the core of Christianity, guilt is the alarm we use when we find our flaws or mistakes or our sins.

5191 2018-05-15 14:01:19 How come supply and demand is not working? America has enough oil to export, yet the pump prices are going up for no apparent reason, enough that it has already wiped out any tax saving benefit. WE the PEOPLE loose, "Big Oil" gains,,,there is something wrong.
5192 2018-05-15 14:01:13 I have to assume that your ignoring the continuous GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra in West Africa by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil is purely because of Biafra Hebrew blood.

5289 2018-05-15 13:52:09 Well I think is was the fact that you were pushing it when it is still illegal. Not justifying the person I didn't read it as about the oil.
5290 2018-05-15 13:52:08 Because you are too stupid to understand, I'll keep it short. There is no oil in Afrin. It's your buddies the USA stealing Syrian oil with YPG/PKK in Manbij. We are in there to get rid of PKK and YPG, and create a safe area for 3.5 million refugees to return home.
5291 2018-05-15 13:51:58 Looks like oil.

5299 2018-05-15 13:51:09 Like this one - oilfield services are bound to get wins with oil and gas sector looking strong. #NTQ looking to capitalise on this both in N America and through expanding their global reach.

I tried CBD oil & it didn’t help me but I hear it helps a lot of people. #ChronicPain I’m trying Kratom & it works but govt is taking it off the market. I’m fortunate my pool is open today & water aerobics does wonders for my joint pain. Thank you.
5304 2018-05-15 13:50:50 Oil prices going up will make fossil fools eye drilling off the US East Coast with greedy eyes.
5305 2018-05-15 13:50:48 And oil. Lotsa olive oil. And a lorra Korea salt
5306 2018-05-15 13:50:47 High Oil prices Brent near to $80. Who befits most? America?
5307 2018-05-15 13:50:42 To “win”, the US needs both stocks and oil to not be affected by raising rates and strong USD.  They’ll try to hold on
5308 2018-05-15 13:50:29 My 93 year old grandmother is about as far from a pot smoking hippie as one can get.

If she takes CBD oil for the inflammation in her hands , I think it's safe to say it's okay for almost everyone else.

5310 2018-05-15 13:50:13 Yes that is the point that was originally made. Now it is up to companies to decide the rate of oil. Yet the rate was not changed for almost 2 weeks till the 13th, the companies are supposed to be autonomous, It could be a form of appeasement.
5311 2018-05-15 13:50:08 Plus compliqué : le shale oil n’est pas rentable à 32 $, la preuve, lorsque le prix est passé sous les 60/70, beaucoupde faillites de sociétés US du secteur. De plus, la fracturation hydraulique ce sont des puits exploités beaucoup moins longtemps.
5312 2018-05-15 13:50:08 Trump won't say a word until he decides how to "take the oil."
5313 2018-05-15 13:50:08 If the PB jars where you have to mix in the oil aren’t like 10x as healthy then someone’s gonna have to answer for this arthritis I’m developing.
5314 2018-05-15 13:50:05 Follow the money!  @realDonaldTrump benefits from the Qatari investment firm’s purchase of shares in Putin’s oil company.  He likely gets a commission. And Jared Kushner gets a big loan from Qatar. #TrumpisTheSwamp
5315 2018-05-15 13:50:00 So people are pissed that she said "tar sands" instead of "oil sands?" Talk about political correctness.

5351 2018-05-15 13:46:25 Never mind the impact rising oil will have on global economies
5352 2018-05-15 13:46:24 Actually there is not a diminishing supply of crude. Shale oil and fracking have greatly increased the supply. The problem is more on the refining side. No new refineries have been built in the last 20 years. Price increase is panic driven, not reality driven

Is this still advisable? Or is it a matter of what works for me? Also, can I use both the tea tree oil + brightening serum at night?

5397 2018-05-15 13:40:05 If oil prices begin to meaningfully subside at some point, it probably won't be because of a breakout of world peace.  It will be because currently higher prices induce more U.S. production, helping to counteract some of the supply interruptions experienced elsewhere.#shale

5402 2018-05-15 13:39:40 Also, the gross oil production tax is not the sales tax or income tax. That is an industry specific tax and has nothing to do with the #fairshare. Not to mention the other yearly “fees” and “permits” that are just hidden taxes. It isn’t a tax problem, it is a spending problem.

5424 2018-05-15 13:37:48 This Day in Legal History: 1911

On May 15, 1911, the US Supreme Court upheld the lower court judgment and declared the Standard Oil group to be an "unreasonable" monopoly under the Sherman Antitrust Act, Section II and broke it into 34 separate companies.

5425 2018-05-15 13:37:35 what about the extraction and transportation of the oil to the refineries, is that in your calculations? plus any reduction in emissions is better than none

5427 2018-05-15 13:37:26 My favorite is when they use prepay $ for things other than what it was intended for. “I know you prepaid this seed, but clearly that would be better used for this crop oil”
5428 2018-05-15 13:37:23 Napanganga ako kay kuya na biglang kumain ng mainit na kanin with chicken oil at niluwa niya because it’s hot. Naalala ko tuloy ang kasabihan na “ang kasal ay hindi parang kanin na iluluwa kapag napaso.”

Wow, E. Seriously?

5430 2018-05-15 13:37:05 Some folks I knew in high school decided to deep fry everything they ate for an entire month. Someone deep fried gummi bears which just melted. They never changed the oil so for the next little while everything else they deep fried had a slight candy coating.

5455 2018-05-15 13:33:57 The price of oil has steadily gone up since tRump took office all due to his insane foreign policies or lack there of. I proudly pay the CA gas tax because I like having a great transportation system. I support and will be voting for @GavinNewsom #VoteBlue #BlueWave2018 
5456 2018-05-15 13:33:56 He brags about helping China, but he can’t do anything “great” here!  No health care, a crap load of law suits for unconstitutional based policies, Mexico is NOT paying 4 the wall! Let’s not forget Russia. He is helping their oil industry & our gas is going up!

5465 2018-05-15 13:32:41 We don’t need to steal the oil , because we have our own oil , we’re a nation blessed with rich natural resources plus human /brain capital. If we decide to make an industrial revolution and replace oil w something else, what’ll happen to the Arabs? This’s the question.

5515 2018-05-15 13:27:18 I live in Oklahoma. The gross production tax on oil was slashed to 1%. Our state coffers were emptied. Schools closed, benefits to the disabled were curtailed. Now they're raising the taxes again to make ends meet.

5544 2018-05-15 13:23:34 Imagine. It is December, 2016. Russia is under sanctions for taking Crimea. Russia is cash short, and offers to sell an oil firm, Rosneft. Newly elected @realDonaldTrump is cash short too. Russia offers Trump 0.5% ($282m) to broker sale of Rosneft, involving Qatar. Trump accepts.
5545 2018-05-15 13:23:31 Turkey vocal on not alienating Iran, Israel in opposite camp. Their one-upmanship is a proxy for the Iran story, which is an oil story. More of a second order linkage than a first order.

5550 2018-05-15 13:22:46 Its a bit like how the IEA measures oil input in the Middle East by counting tankers and seeing how low down in the water they are (because there are no official figures you can get hold of).

5555 2018-05-15 13:22:23 The oil companies are half-right.  EVs have lower lifecycle emissions than ICE cars, but only by 25-75%.  That's not enough to make sustained investments in car infrastructure a smart move, especially accounting for licensing effects.

It's simple: We need public transit.
5556 2018-05-15 13:22:23 Aye, let’s go full hung ho and try to think of the worse possible scenario. 
“Our” resources have kept the UK in the manor it’s become accustomed too. Since oil and gas was discovered it’s been “almost running out”. Change the record.

5590 2018-05-15 13:19:37 This is the most reasonable answer I’ve ever received after commenting on an @OilsandsAction tweet.
However, with oil prices still 30% lower than 2011-2014 levels, I hardly call it surging, and find it hard to justify record prices for gas products in Canada.
5591 2018-05-15 13:19:29 That much $ tied up in one piece of canvas with some oil on it. While children are bombed and shot to protect oil profits elsewhere.

5693 2018-05-15 13:08:40 I want a chip to block emotional pain. Iv got essential oils, coconut oil, and body wraps for the physical pain.
5694 2018-05-15 13:08:39 Oil is higher but Canadian data weak.. (CAD) Existing Home Sales (MoM)  (APR), Actual: -2.9% 
Expected: 0.4%  Previous: 1.3%
5695 2018-05-15 13:08:39 They promoted some motorcycle spray or oil too  the last epsiode of season one or the one before was all about promotions
5696 2018-05-15 13:08:36 Does it give me some comfort to know that smug financial advice types who think they earned what they've got are still going to die in tatters, huddled next to an oil drum fire in a post-apocalyptic wasteland like the rest of us? No, actually
5697 2018-05-15 13:08:03 No they’re fighting to protect the freedom of oppressed minorities in countries where that term actually means something, where people are told how to live every moment of their life and controlled by fear. We aren’t at war over oil or money
5698 2018-05-15 13:08:00 Iyaaa.. Olesin baby oil coba diik. Atau dikompres..
5699 2018-05-15 13:07:54 the coconut oil smells just like the biscuit
5700 2018-05-15 13:07:42 Do they make beard oil?
5701 2018-05-15 13:07:35 펜도... 모 쓰시나요...
5702 2018-05-15 13:07:29 @realDonaldTrump Praying for First Lady and you. Keep up the good work. Love you guys. Still need oil, gas,power plant, coal jobs San Juan Co,NM Monty
5703 2018-05-15 13:07:26 changed my brake lights, cleaned out my car, now all I have to do it is change my oil, get new windshield wipers, drop my car and then wash it... the price of getting a new car
5704 2018-05-15 13:07:22 Just wondering if it ever dawned on anyone that having 3x or 4x more of the oil supply available will lessen the value even more when prices drop. You'll have to take a haircut just to keep the oil flowing. Keep it in mind.
5705 2018-05-15 13:07:19 well done David. Thumbises up from Heid  
5706 2018-05-15 13:07:17 No understanding of either science or mathematics, but you will open your big fat mouth and condemn children to to deal with disaster after disaster because what -you have shares in oil or something? Anthropogenic climate change is the biggest challenge we have ever faced.
5707 2018-05-15 13:07:14 I've got extra virgin olive oil cos I'm flash as fook
5708 2018-05-15 13:07:12 coba pake bio oil syg ))
5709 2018-05-15 13:07:11 Globalization? The US has oil/gas; India doesn’t...yet we pay same price per bbl that they do? No breaks 4 US consumers? Thought we were told when we were energy independent prices wud no longer spike at pump. Lies.
5710 2018-05-15 13:07:01 Saudi Arabia has always committed brutal crimes against human rights just because it is an oil land
5711 2018-05-15 13:06:54 Interesting, I am guessing the projection from oil has been increased to align closely with present reality and the corresponding expenses will be for constituency projects.....
5712 2018-05-15 13:06:51 Wow, rupee knocked 68 today. That is a rapid slide from what it was at the beginning of the year. High crude oil prices and incrassing CAD are taking a toll on Rupee
5713 2018-05-15 13:06:46 I have so much coconut oil on today I think I've left a trail
5714 2018-05-15 13:06:43 미세먼지 및 공기질 대책 중 경유차량 대책은 잘 못되었다. 연료보다는 주행거리에 따라 오염량의 다소가 결정되는 것이니 오염시키는 양에 따라 원인자부담금을 부과하는 것이 옳다고 본다. 휘발유와 가스는 무한정 오염시켜도 괜찮고 경유는 안되는 논리는 매우 비과학적이다. 법안재검토를 바란다.

5719 2018-05-15 13:06:30 헐 진짜요? (참기름님은..이런채색을.. 좋아한다...(메모중))
5720 2018-05-15 13:06:30 Plastic city fans.......remember without oil money you are nothing!
5721 2018-05-15 13:06:28 I am guessing that is a fallout of the unexpected rise in oil prices. This is an opportunity to make good use of our excess oil revenue. Let's hope a sizable sum would not end up in private pockets...
5722 2018-05-15 13:06:26 Imagine if everyone wasn't greedy or selfish and contempt with having just enough. We'd all live off the land and eat fruit and shit, we'd save the planet but instead let's kill each other over oil and use said oil to destroy our home haha we so smart

5729 2018-05-15 13:05:25 When pouring boiling oil on “invaders” climbing a wall would be the more humane option.

-شششش، volatile oil
5736 2018-05-15 13:04:17 That sounds like a bit of a PR answer, tbh. Presuming you still stock quite a lot of branded produce that includes non-sustainable palm oil.

You do more than most, but you're in a position to publicly, vocally lead the sector further. Please don't abdicate that responsibility.
5737 2018-05-15 13:04:13 10분전부터 계속 충전기 끼고 있었는데 2퍼임
5738 2018-05-15 13:04:10 I'll get it every now and then when I want a specific flavor and don't feel like getting syrups or whatever.

It's still better than the flavored beans/grinds which will get that flavor oil all up in your grinder and whatever you're brewing with.
5739 2018-05-15 13:04:08 Every time It happens we wonder if or when this will be the last slam on precious metals. 
Gold below $1300, Rickards-what do you say about that?
Silver $16.26 
Oils price going up- criminal rigged energy markets even though of plenty oil available 
Criminals still in charge
5740 2018-05-15 13:04:06 Dollar is on a roll!
5741 2018-05-15 13:04:03 Yes. You're right. Religious extremists exist. KKK and Some Indian cult. 
ISIS is an organization created by Israel MOSAD to cause a civil war in Syria.  Their purpose is to take over golan heights after millions of barrels of oil was found under Golan heights.
5742 2018-05-15 13:03:54 No but you can try CBD oil. It is very effective.
5743 2018-05-15 13:03:46 Comienza la Realidad de Patrick Corbin ... Gas Oil Low
5744 2018-05-15 13:03:35 i picked up the milk as well. the Fancy skincare samples from the hotel i stayed at included cleansing oil, face wash, a lotion and a milk (to leave on overnight) and while i'm NO WAY buying that fancy brand i do enjoy using the oil and milk so picked up cheaper ones haha
5745 2018-05-15 13:03:31 Eucalyptus oil always works a treat ... or 'baby wipes' even clean whiteboards 
5746 2018-05-15 13:03:12 Absolutely! Only a change in regime could save the country's oil industry from the upcoming disaster!

5760 2018-05-15 13:01:58 U.S. shares rose Monday as trade tensions cooled off and energy companies posted gains amid higher oil prices.
5761 2018-05-15 13:01:49 As you age, daily oil massage is important, as are good rest and good exercise. Lifelong exercise helps your circulation, which in turn helps your skin as well. Just remember to protect the skin if you’re exercising outdoors.
5762 2018-05-15 13:01:49 Come on DOF, #TRAIN tax-tax-tax is the collateral. Our oil, lpg, cars, coal power, electricity transmission, sugary drinks, etc are rising bec of current spending and future spending to pay more China loans. Why is the #DOF evasive about this?

5765 2018-05-15 13:01:43 A good comparison is Air France flight 447. Plummeted into the ocean in a communication dead zone en route from Brazil to France. They found a ton of debris, an oil slick, and bodies. MH370 is truly bizarre.

5788 2018-05-15 12:59:22 the oil exporters shouldn’t feel the exhilaration of victory,this price doesn’t depend on the market dynamics, so it may collapse dramatically again if the geopolitics has been changed, yet the shale producers may take advantage of it, it’s just a matter of time

5794 2018-05-15 12:58:58 We just went over this in my sociology class. I felt like the problem is way too big for society. True we can be making contributions but a lot starts with the oil & gas market too. Texas is known for its large refineries. Toxins are being released into the air daily.
5795 2018-05-15 12:58:52 No I read a report yesterday that’s been buried they’re making they’re way up into Syria and taking over oil fields this is just keeping thos move outta the MSM look up genesus energy Syria and see the cooked underhand Thievy going on right in front of everyone guised as a war

"Let's bring back steam cars...its a government cover-up!"
"It's these oil companies, they can charge anything they want"

5970 2018-05-15 12:36:10 I'm on the beach, being hugely reminded of why I hate Brighton beach in the summer and only come here off season normally. Offensively loud RnB from the bars, the smell of mechanically-recovered meat frying in old oil and sights I can't unsee.

5972 2018-05-15 12:35:59 @mikexingchen I just watched a video you posted 6 months ago while you were in Teipei and all I could think was “how is he going to get people buy his hot oil when he has said on other videos to not buy the hot oil sold in Asian grocery stores?” With that said, I would buy it.

5975 2018-05-15 12:35:22 So oil has not only passed $79 it has kept surging...now at $79.29, up 3.5% since yesterday. Guessing DT is long
5976 2018-05-15 12:35:09 I gave up on trying to figure out words strong enough to describe this admin. And that is after years in the oil patch, offshore and on ships. If I started saying what describes them it would last well in to tomorrow.

5980 2018-05-15 12:34:54 And that assumes that getting out as a net oil importers (US net imports tanks) and net ag importers (US is a net exporters) won’t see a real inflation (usually that’s the case if the inflation picking up).

6055 2018-05-15 12:26:14 Must be about #Opium then not Oil. That would be what connects Iran-China and explain certain things.

6097 2018-05-15 12:19:46 We are in overall agreement but we also have to adopt correct wave nomenclature + put timing into perspective. Medium-term for US$/CAD is below the Nov.’07 low of 0.9059 but not for some time. But when this low is broken, sure, crude oil will trade much higher, well over $100.
6098 2018-05-15 12:19:45 Also I've got to look in on it but my.ongoing eur/usd trade shouldn't be where it is not particularly about this moment but that's uncanny with the shorting of oil but no matter the influencing variable that's off too

6110 2018-05-15 12:18:05 Oil prices hitting $80. And yes, that means higher gas prices, probably hitting right about Memorial Day. Now, before you ask, there is no evidence in our studies that this means people will travel less. At some point, they might change spending slightly but don't overreact.

6120 2018-05-15 12:17:18 @WhiteHouse 4) IMO California Legislation for solar panels in every new home is smart considering that #OPEC S.Arabia & Gulf, so called strategic partners, agreed last week to cut supplies to lift Oil barrrel to $90-100 level, hurting US Consumers & Industry in Summer season

He was married 7 times if you count one twice.

6152 2018-05-15 12:14:14 We'd recommend following the cooking instructions on the packaging, but if you'd like to cook without the sauce, that works fine too! When cooking on the hub we'd recommend to add a bit of oil to make it a bit easier. Make sure to let us know how it turns out!
6153 2018-05-15 12:14:11 Fact is that as long as oil was being sent nobody internationally gave any actual fucks to the multiple human rights violations, that USA was the main buyer of our oil that paid cash so to speak would give credence to a bigger part of the guilt, but again it was

6370 2018-05-15 11:48:41 Trump, first he created lot of problems by getting higher prices 4 aluminium& iron& now he's going 2 sell oil at 100 dollars each while a few days ago he said 80 dollars is he going mad or he wants 2 create more trouble than he already has done as nobody agrees on d flacuatations
6371 2018-05-15 11:48:37 @cnni ....There are reports in world business that the shortage of sand to create glass is due to the shifting of sales  to oil drilling companies for fracking.
6372 2018-05-15 11:48:20 Was not a fan of George W., and absolutely hated Dick Chaney.  But when the gas prices started to get out of hand, old Dick would go talk to his oil buddies and the prices would fall. No such thing with Trump.
6373 2018-05-15 11:48:17 girl girl girl i GOTTA recommend rosehip oil for moisture OMG
i put it on before i sleep and then my skin is so soft/plump in the morning!!!
6374 2018-05-15 11:48:12 It’s a crap shoot I’ve seen it all! It depends how much it gets oil at load out. Where they pull it out of the pile in the shed etc!
6375 2018-05-15 11:48:11 Putin bragged he picked Tilly not trump or congress but Vlad because he is desperate to get those oil sanctions lifted so he can drill in the arctic with Exxon remember exxon lost millions because of those sanctions.
6376 2018-05-15 11:48:09 Brushing will pull up any dead hair/skin & distribute natural oil throughout the coat. Soft bristles are gentle on the underside of dogs.
6377 2018-05-15 11:48:00 Can water be mixed with oil?
6378 2018-05-15 11:47:39 not again lol

6380 2018-05-15 11:47:28 I don’t remember companies changing their names to attract hippies or even yuppies. And, Foreign oil burned well in vw buses, Porsche’s, wagons, minivans.
6381 2018-05-15 11:47:28 Changed the Omega's diff oil yesterday. Have since showered and washed my hands 4,000 times. Can still smell the bloody stuff. Horrible.

6383 2018-05-15 11:46:58 Currently being an adult and getting my oil changed 
6384 2018-05-15 11:46:51 Chinese people eat healthy for days , that's why they live longer & are slim & active . 

they hardly use oil because they boil most of their food .
6385 2018-05-15 11:46:35 Two independent medical opinions are always better than one. But consider that if you ask a mechanic if the oil needs changing and the answer will almost inevitably be "yes"!
6386 2018-05-15 11:46:30 คับ
6387 2018-05-15 11:46:18 If one goes in for an oil change and asks for the air filter to be replaced, is it acceptable for them to take out the old filter and not replace it, not even putting the console back together? Asking for a friend.
6388 2018-05-15 11:46:03 lemon, ginger, thyme and honey tea with a shot of white rum. drink 3 cups of this after every every meal. Also rub olbus oil and vapour rub on your back, chest and throat and just sleep it off really. get well soon xx

6391 2018-05-15 11:45:51 I put waaaaay too much peppermint oil on my scalp this morning 
6392 2018-05-15 11:45:28 It is shamefully all about interest.  The #US has an oil and gas pipeline that goes through #Cameroun . The #US is addicted to oil and will even go to bed with a snake to get oil. That's how they cooked lies about weapons of mass destruction and invaded #Iraq only because of oil.
6393 2018-05-15 11:45:23 I can help:

"To remain a useful tool of American foreign policy, which quite simply, is a war economy, it is helpful if Britain privatises its health service to continue making, procuring and buying offensive weaponry to cope with increasingly expensive oil extraction wars."
6394 2018-05-15 11:45:14 Because I know it’s difficult to diet while cooking for yourself. Here’s some fast food meta:

Any grilled chicken 
Salads with a vinegar dressing (I would use my own olive oil and red wine vinegar
Jimmy Johns lettuce wraps saved me
Lean deli meat wrapped in cheese for snacks

6406 2018-05-15 11:43:00 Sometimes it seems like oil rallies for the hell of it - can I get $500?
6407 2018-05-15 11:42:53 Oil over $85, trade war concerns, rate hikes, and inflation can put us into recession. So yes, it’s entirely possible.  Thinking it will take some time to play out so not immediately imminent if at all.

6426 2018-05-15 11:40:47 I’ve been fighting palm oil and trying to educate people about it and it’s destructiveness for over 12 years now.  It’s insidious and in everything.  Unfortunately greed and profit is the all encompassing motivator for producers and manufacturers

6444 2018-05-15 11:37:44 Conflict in the Gulf would probably stop/radically reduce Gulf tanker flow. Any owner would risk their ships. Insurance might be difficult or impossible to get. Crews might not be willing to man oil taker in a confined and very dangerous war zone. Gas tankers even worse.

6452 2018-05-15 11:37:00 That is the biggest mistake of likening countries lacking serious leadership. Egypt is an Arab country in Africa and they do not be associated with blacks. Nigeria has neber had a serious leader despite having some of the biggest oil reserves. SA has a right to act.
6453 2018-05-15 11:37:00 Prospect for oil at the House of Representatives.
6454 2018-05-15 11:36:49 The collision allegations have not been proven false. Trump just says that on Twitter and you accept it as reality. His personal lawyer was funneled 500k from a Russian oligarch. He refuses to implement Russian sanctions. He sabotaged the Iran deal which helps Russian oil.
6455 2018-05-15 11:35:34 You know you can dig for oil right here in your own backyard oil is a substance that flows beneath the earths surface hahahahahaah

My uncle in #ND told me, two years ago, that Big Oil (aka #fossilfuels) was capping most of its wells because the prices were too low to justify the expenses of #fracking. Now they've uncapped the wells & have returned to raping the environment.

6651 2018-05-15 11:07:20 Oil prices racing to $80 per barrel is a good news for Nigeria in the short term. The change is, Buhari who will protect & not Jonathan who will siphon it is in charge. We cn make an enduring gains for the long term by applying the proceeds to open up the economy productively.

6662 2018-05-15 11:06:01 That is bang out of order. Olive oil has no place in the frying of chips. I went to his Winchester franchise restaurant a coupe of years back and it was surprisingly good. A lot of the TV chefs spread themselves too thin and the food suffers
6663 2018-05-15 11:05:40 I don’t trade oil per say but good for off shore O&G projects and Ship supply services.
6664 2018-05-15 11:05:28 Plastic will be most valuable mining recource in Future. All todays "dumps" will be more valuable then todays Oil Rigs.
6665 2018-05-15 11:05:27 It's inevitable. Teams like Madrid and Barca are already supporting it. Big money move, this one. Cash flow has to be taken care of with the EPL/Oil money.

6777 2018-05-15 10:49:05 Ohio has this month the highest avg gas prices in the US. The GOP administration of Kasich and DeWine has been pro-fracking and has done nothing to end pricegouging by Canadian, British, Dutch and American oil cos Circle K, BP, Shell, Exxon, Marathon etc.
6778 2018-05-15 10:49:00 It was a 'vision of the future years from now' that drove the destruction of our rail infrastructure because oil was so cheap. So, that went well.
6779 2018-05-15 10:48:55 Hi Sarah, the use of the RSPO trademark on pack is not mandatory but we encourage brands to display it so that consumers can easily choose sustainable palm oil products. You can get in touch with your favourite brands and ask them to do so.

6788 2018-05-15 10:46:54 You are paying higher rents due to rent stabilization’s reduction of the housing stock. Local Law 11 and oil 2 mandates increase the cost of housing. Laws which saddle owners with parasitic tenants they can’t evict for nonpayment increase the cost of housing.

6845 2018-05-15 10:38:13 The recent surge in oil prices which is being driven by the situation between Iran and US bodes well for the crude trading line particularly. The surge is not positive for the petroleum downstream line amidst the current PMS and HHK price regulation in Nigeria.

6912 2018-05-15 10:25:55 Happy Tuesday! Asian markets closed down, Euorpean trading is mixed, futures are down & crude oil is up. have a nice day!
6913 2018-05-15 10:25:35 Is this the North Sea oil industry that was going to collapse if Scotland became independent?
6914 2018-05-15 10:25:01 Hadn't others looked there and given up? Even IF there was oil there it would take a long time to exploit the resources.

6916 2018-05-15 10:24:55 Oil hits new highs on tight supply and planned US sanctions on Iran
6917 2018-05-15 10:24:52 Tipped bottle of orange blossom oil overWhole house seems to reek (it’s only the lounge), so we’ve all had to retreat into garden while I open all windows. 
6918 2018-05-15 10:24:29 Ghana doesnt produce oil,  opec ensures that supply os controlled, even if feasibiltu studies takes years.$100 million for oil
6919 2018-05-15 10:24:26 Firstly, if oil money was poured into LFC, yes I would be the first to say that was a huge contributor to any subsequent success. Secondly, we were something before any potential investment. We competed purely based on what we were and what we have. City, were nothing, zilch.
6920 2018-05-15 10:23:57 USDCAD has rallied overnight but oil is back on the days highs now which may be a drag on the USDCAD rise..
6921 2018-05-15 10:23:48 USDCAD has rallied overnight but oil is back on the days highs now which may be a drag on the USDCAD rise..
6922 2018-05-15 10:23:47 Sunscreen? Do you mean dark tanning oil 
6923 2018-05-15 10:23:38 Well I am not sure there is a cause and effect in the matter you just raised now and the story I shared. You have to have money to buy this kind of car and I will be honest, unless you are a politician, a pastor, someone with oil money, you can’t buy this kind of car in Nigeria
6924 2018-05-15 10:23:35 By the way I got a present for my collection from Ireland, I wished some single malt Irish whiskey like Bushmills however I got more fruity Jameson Black Barrel and I'm sure it was considered according to my oil mentions of those less sweet or sour things of the profit. Thanks.

6942 2018-05-15 10:21:17 IT goes with corruption, too, Venezuela's oil and refineries companies are so inefficient with it, they have to import gas (refined oil) !

6947 2018-05-15 10:20:37 I’ve read that the CBD oil that is legal in the U.K. doesn’t have the thc ingredient in it, and it can make things worse. I don’t know if it’s true, but apparently it’s the thc that helps , and it’s not legal over here.

7147 2018-05-15 09:43:21 The risk with simply boycotting or banning palm oil is that the problem shifts elsewhere. It's one of the highest yielding oil crops around, so the alternatives take even more land to grow. Sustainable palm oil is what's really needed.

7280 2018-05-15 09:21:30 This is a little method that worked for me. First, strip down and anoint yourself in the forbidden Oil of Ceoghomorrha.

7281 2018-05-15 09:21:20 Oil – The number one thing Africa's giant is most famous for is petroleum. When you think oil, you think Nigeria. Nigeria remains Africa's largest oil producer, though the country went from being 10th to 12th largest producer of oil in the world.

Why did Trump do it? The more instability in the Middle East the higher oil prices get. Russian and US oil producers' profits have been falling. Announce egregious support for an embassy, cancel a peace deal, result is higher oil prices; job done.

7392 2018-05-15 09:04:48 Now the rates have been deregularised since 2015, meaning the oil companies can revise rates by themselves.

7465 2018-05-15 08:49:01 4- Regardless, please not that:
A- OPEC officials do not like my argument that speculators’ impact is limited
B- any argument saying that speculators “cause” price movement and set a trend for the oil industry needs a “theory” and empirical evidence to support it.
7466 2018-05-15 08:48:58 Your experience in the oil and gas sector hasn't aided your knowledge of fisheries, environmental protection and UN conventions on sea borders. Just another whinging, nationalist sheep it would seem.

7468 2018-05-15 08:48:41 If im honest, i was surprised af on how you managed to get that shit tasting like its been on a greasy pizza complete with oil as if you literally took it off a pizza
7469 2018-05-15 08:48:29 now the us may finally pay attention to climate change because their precious oil is at stake
7470 2018-05-15 08:48:25 If Iran & Russia accept China's switch n oil pricing from USD 2 yuan the US will b out of the trade loop. Trump leaving Iran Deal & adding sanctions will b meaningless. T tryng 2 offer 2 help w/ China ZTE jobs in exchange 4 China keeping USD oil pricing & he endangers US security

7499 2018-05-15 08:42:03 @Micsterator You should reread the #SteeleDossier now that we know about Michael Cohen & Qatar diplomats in TT in 12/2016. Seems the Russians had a slush fund too. The oil company sold 19.5% mentioned in Dossier.. Mueller is THE MAN.

7515 2018-05-15 08:38:18 This has to be a tomato conversion plant... as in it converts it to crude oil
7516 2018-05-15 08:38:09 With elections out of the way will the market be forced to deal now with macro headwinds like Oil and weak INR? Even a possible rate hike ahead? How long can earnings season hold up the trend? Not too far I would think........
7517 2018-05-15 08:38:04 China, the world's largest oil user is trying 2 change oil pricing from USD to yuan, Trump is frantic. T is invested in oil. Ru will buy Iran's oil & open 2 change to yuan. Oil is Ru main export & this avoids US sanctions.T trying 2 sway China from yuan pricing, offering ZTE help
7518 2018-05-15 08:37:42 The main factor in pushing up fuel prices is the cost of crude oil has been volatile all year but we've seen a particular increase in the last month with a jump of over 10 dollars which is now being passed on to motorists at the pumps @BarryAldworth of AAIreland on rising costs
7519 2018-05-15 08:37:01 You’re both young my dude, you’ll both learn how fun and important foreplay is before you step up the main act. Gotta get the oil in the lines before you start pumpin 
7520 2018-05-15 08:36:57 You've no argument on oil money, city are self sufficient as the money lists prove it, where was your atmosphere v West Brom in the FA cup? Don't chat shit the league is the bread & butter, domestic cups are a bonus & it's still 28 years
7521 2018-05-15 08:36:44 Groundnut oil or palmoil? Which one?
7522 2018-05-15 08:36:43 gave you tried espresso with coconut butter/oil? Wonderful stuff
7523 2018-05-15 08:36:35 Often a low oil price means £ rises but this is not always the case. During the oil price crash Sterling didn't move much because UK economy not dependent on oil and gas
7524 2018-05-15 08:36:01 I agree, oil has been on the nose for almost 3.5 yrs now. The sudden pop and if susstained should drag many of the juniors back up! Kinda like the iron ore price rise late 2016 then mid 17 i think it was.
7525 2018-05-15 08:35:46 Probably on Sunday, if it's no raining I'll be finally taking my bike out of storage and do some needed maintenance on it  after two years. Change rubbers, oil stuff etc

7532 2018-05-15 08:35:07 Bertie Ahern extended licensing terms for oil and gas companies, abolished royalties from Irish fields, and drastically reduced the tax rate for exploration giving Shell full capacity to exploit Irish resources with no benefit for the people #ShellToSea
7533 2018-05-15 08:35:00 PET  has to cope with 2 severe world wide recessions. No world leader did a good job during that time that OPEC crashed oil prices.
7534 2018-05-15 08:34:50 Great idea. Try organic coconut oil instead to highlight your gorgeous skin rather than hide it!
7535 2018-05-15 08:34:37 Thank you !   Which essential oil. Di you think ?
7536 2018-05-15 08:34:35 Not economically hard hitting, adjustment yes but England, Wales and NI are far more economically diverse than Scotland and doesn't rely on oil income. For example, London generates 23% of UK GDP, additional MOD work boosts jobs in England and NI, possibly Wales.
7537 2018-05-15 08:34:31 Not oil money!!  its a fake fiat US petrodollars printed out of thin air with usury designed to keep us poor.
7538 2018-05-15 08:34:23 chance of israel / iran war pushing oil prices rather than sanctions

7553 2018-05-15 08:31:35 Doesn’t really matter. For the league, no one can really compete with oil money, so it just doesn’t mean as much. But in the cups, it takes spirit, pedigree, atmosphere - and as you found out, you can’t buy that.

7590 2018-05-15 08:24:03 Hmm... Oil and carbohydrates are the "high energy food" the thing that makes you fat. But how they affect your body is different. Eating fat adjust your body to burn fat, eating carbs adjust your body to burn carbs, since your body stores fat not carbs, it's better to eat fat.

7601 2018-05-15 08:22:29 There's something comforting? About knowing your limits. I started oil painting and although I want to make hyperrealistic art I know I can only do so much with my 3 days experience and it makes me feel better to know it can't get worse from here and I can only get better.

7651 2018-05-15 08:13:17 There is some evidence for what is being said here in that Iran accepts payment  for oil in Euros. Always thought there was a plan afoot for China to come up with payments using basket of currencies.
7652 2018-05-15 08:13:07 Chief Anayo Arinze said that #Agriculture is major cardinal point of this administration and yet the groundnut pyramid, cocoa reserves and palm oil is no where to be seen, while the Malaysian came to borrow our palm seedlings in 1960 now reserved is the case. #PoliticsNationwide

7750 2018-05-15 07:53:29 When you research the history of the Mideast since oil was discovered in Iran in 1908, it's always been all about oil - invasion, corruption,  constant warfare, exploitation, slaughtering Arabs who fought for control of their own resources.

7761 2018-05-15 07:51:37 Trump/Putin are making bigfrom the US refusal of the Iran Deal & sanctions. It contracted oil supply & prices jumped. Oil is RU main export & T has oil stock (evidenced by deregulation & WH staff picks) Americans get high $ winter heat, gas & food but T/Putin made a fortune! 
7762 2018-05-15 07:51:12 Then use a bit of garlic oil or garlic powder instead. Both do their job well if you can't stomach it well.
7763 2018-05-15 07:51:03 Like Chavez in Venezuela? He relied on an income from high oil prices that he distributed to the people, making him very popular. When oil prices crashed he became far less popular because he failed to diversify the economy.

7866 2018-05-15 07:26:50 That’s why I have a rule to follow a recipe exactly the first time I cook it. Only then might I adapt slightly. Certain chefs have certain tastes. Jamie likes lots of olive oil, Delia likes lots of sugar. Obviously Nigella’s tastes are perfect...

7894 2018-05-15 07:20:36 You have no idea about Turkey. You can buy only 253 liters with minimum salary, per month. So that is like nothing for us. And we pay %70 tax for oil. You have to work 137 months without eating to buy Model 3. World is not fair.
7895 2018-05-15 07:20:20 Also be aware for every play made in politics, there is more than one angle. Take the Iran deal for instance. It wasnt about nuclear weapons it's about the oil market worldwide, and its right there in the details of the JCPOA.
7896 2018-05-15 07:19:43 Well that was an expensive mistake!

7902 2018-05-15 07:18:17 I've spoken on numerous occasions about how our imperialism really fucked up Iran.

Chavez died and the price of oil crashed right around when things went South in Venezuela.

Because the keys were in disarray, and there was no treasure anymore.

8257 2018-05-15 06:17:18 More important to note is the differential in total (from ground to exhaust pipe) emissions between AB tar sands oil and the cleanest oil on the planet. Calculations show this to be less than 10% differential. that leaves 90% protectionism.

8266 2018-05-15 06:15:51 #RRL    Revenues over the half-year rose by 39% to US$5.4mln (US$3.9mln) due largely to the higher production. Average oil prices received also rose by 13.7% to US$48.1 per barrel. Current price of oil is pushing revenues higher. Looking forward to next trading news and updates.

8268 2018-05-15 06:15:43 Trump actually said he ran so he would not have to pay taxes.  He did it too. He no longer has to pay but the middle class does.

8271 2018-05-15 06:15:32 Or the US could grow some balls and actually compete in the world economy by investing in "big green" as much as the leading countries are.  You know like how CAPITALISM and the FREE MARKET work.  Instead big oil wants to use cronyism, and Oligarchy bullying to win.

8276 2018-05-15 06:14:30 you may be right but we will be losers in terms of democratic control, management of borders, as we will screw up the balance of the Nordic region big time...and we dont have oil supplies as our calling card

8307 2018-05-15 06:09:51 Yes, we are the only country to have ever used them. Yet, the sworn enemies of Iran are allowed nukes, but they aren't. So oil appears to be the only option, for Iran to buy the support/defense they need. Unless ofc US lies about a treaty, in order to prevent them from having it.

8323 2018-05-15 06:07:52 Good morning famz

Truth is like oil; No matter how much you try to dilute it with water, it will always float
8324 2018-05-15 06:07:26 Oil and water do not mix
8325 2018-05-15 06:07:01 Probably because you first input "oil" not "oli", I'd assume?

8327 2018-05-15 06:06:46 Can Palestinians push Jews out from their homes the way Jewish settlers do to Palestinians? That's in the core of equality.

8329 2018-05-15 06:06:24 The two main catalyst's for British Imperial interest in the region was the emergence of Zionism in the late 1800s backed by powerful Jewish lobby's and monied interests. And Oil. Thus the motivations were political first and quasi religious second.
8330 2018-05-15 06:06:09 Risotto:
1 cup rice to 3 cups stock. Put some chopped onion or leek in a pan with a fairly generous swirl or two of oil, then add the dry rice to it for a min or two, then add stock ladle by ladle as it soaks it up and cooks the rice. Add any veg you have, and frozen works too.

Yes it helps companies, who are major employers of citizens.

8518 2018-05-15 05:16:42 I have no stats to prove this but I'd say it's the oil heater. It expends energy heating the oil rather than heating you, the oil in turn radiates heat. Whereas a bar heater gets straight to heating the element/bar

8527 2018-05-15 05:14:05 Venezuela in horror. Largest oil reserves in world. Starvation. 2 million refugees. 2400% inflation. Maduro clueless, corrupt dictator. Health care collapse. Homicide 2nd highest world. OAS a failed institution. No US leadership. People in survival mode.
8528 2018-05-15 05:14:04 Those higher oil prices would bring a smile the Putin Cohort’s dial.

8574 2018-05-15 05:03:29 Fossil fuels are finite and burning the whole reserve undoubtedly results in more consequences than benefits for mankind.

8593 2018-05-15 05:00:14 The whole analysis is based on this argument:—“Crude oil prices rose 3 per cent from January to March and OMCs raised retail prices by about 5 per cent during the time.” But petrol & diesel prices are not linked to crude oil, International price of products, respectively.

8657 2018-05-15 04:50:51 Oil is OPEC 's decisions and methods to control the world's cost of goods and services. They can make and break economies at will by manipulating oil prices. Why don't you adress them. What does the Trump administration gain if oil prices rise.. Nothing and OPEC.. Lots & lots $$$

8663 2018-05-15 04:49:42 Coffee infused balsamic reduction with just a touch of clover honey in it, drizzled over both the arugula and the crepe cake. Another pass over the greens with an olive oil. Are you sharing?
8664 2018-05-15 04:49:31 I rinse my quinoa then toast it until it starts to pop. Then I add water. When it's almost done, I add salt. So good! When I'm really decadent, I add olive oil when I serve. Nom. Although I'm not vegan, I prefer my quinoa to be vegan.
8665 2018-05-15 04:49:19 It’s the worst. What flavor even is that? Old dirt and motor oil

oil and marketing company Indian Oil continued the hike in prices of #Petrol and #Diesel for a second straight day. The oil company raised the price of petrol by 15 paise a litre and diesel by 23 paise a litre.

8697 2018-05-15 04:43:05 But they are also their own worst enemies. We built schools, tried to fix their power grids and oil fields to help them but extremist blow it up as fast as you fix it. Their own governments have always been the cause for their poverty and living conditions
8698 2018-05-15 04:43:02 101 skincare routines (face) :
1. Exfoliate your skin atleast once a week
2. Put on virgin coconut oil all over your face before going to bed ( acne prone skin do not do this step ! )
3. Get 9 hours of sleep everyday
4. Drink plenty of water

8700 2018-05-15 04:42:01 I wana be cool and trendy and have a skincare routine but...

a. I’m forgetful af
b. I’m lazy af
c. When I actually do do (ha dodo) something, I’m extremely impatient about seeing results

So I guess I’ll just stick to washing my face & throwing on oil/moisturizer

8705 2018-05-15 04:41:04 The world will never know how sad I am

 A child in the lonely ocean. I want to make it known too

8714 2018-05-15 04:39:56 You lot are shite with irony, but hey, good luck eating oil as a Cheerios substitute in the coming decades.
8715 2018-05-15 04:39:52 Dude same only weed / cbd oil will work for me anymore 
8716 2018-05-15 04:39:52 Moreover, as the value of oil to the world economy that the US was now bankrolling grew, it made strategic sense for the US to have a local ally as a disruptor of unity amongst the largely Arab populations. The Israelis, for their part were happy at getting the benefit
8717 2018-05-15 04:39:21 This photo needs placed next to every recruiter building. Let people know how your treated once you fight for Dick Cheney's oil.

8730 2018-05-15 04:36:33 Crude oil prices are rising in the global market. Only thing that can be done to reduce petrol prices in India is by reducing tax on it. A majority of India's tax amount comes from petrol. Reducing the tax on it will hamper the economic growth. The tweet from Modi is a jumla.

8749 2018-05-15 04:32:28 Someone should contact NYMEX and let them know that the president gets to determine oil prices and not the market.

8751 2018-05-15 04:32:20 "The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects oil production to increase for another decade or two before leveling off. Natural gas production will continue to expand out to 2050. Exxon has a long runway before fossil fuels are out of the equation."

8758 2018-05-15 04:30:58 Well yeah, but that's making a proper dish, not just making rice in and of itself. Add some minced garlic, onions, and oil to a pre-heated pan, add the rice a minute later, and stir constantly. When the rice begins to stick (usually about 5 minutes, for me) take it off the heat.

8777 2018-05-15 04:27:23 Dealerships have this information and my experience is they don't know how or refuse to use it. Be good to break that monopoly and have our cars serviced by people that really care. My experiences are that dealers only provide expensive oil changes.
8778 2018-05-15 04:27:14 I bought a lovely (i.e ‘pricey’) essential rose oil...come home, shower, apply a little, smell like a patio in Summer.  It has .01% Citronella oil.  “Stop and smell the Citronella” ain’t a thing for a reason. 
8779 2018-05-15 04:26:58 Coconut oil is worst thing I ever did to my face. Lucky you
8780 2018-05-15 04:26:33 PH also promised to stabilise the petrol price and reintroduce subsidies for some. That would offset the rise of oil price, no?
8781 2018-05-15 04:26:10 You could get cbd oil without health insurance. I use it for my anxiety and it's done more than what a doctor gave me. It's all natural and organic. Check out @NaturesUltra They are good about answering questions on their live chat part of their web page. Good luck
8782 2018-05-15 04:25:57 Nope. Current price is nearly 80 and experts predict according to the chart that it will break the 80 threshold soon. I think you missed out an iota of very important info. The local oil value is far higher than that as it contains very little sulphur and could easily fetch you..
8783 2018-05-15 04:25:43 I've got tons of delicious sounding recipes but they all use ungodly amounts of the most expensive things ( almond flour, organic coconut oil, almond butter) that every night I set out to make one I end up making none because what if it's yucky and I've wasted ingredients?
8784 2018-05-15 04:25:32 Also I’ve never used the olive oil one either but I’m probably going to get it lmao

8791 2018-05-15 04:23:47 For some adults breakouts are as a result of hypersensitivity or overproduction of androgens, the male hormone. For women this can happen during pregnancy, perimenopause and menopause. These hormones stimulate the oil glands and hair follicles in the skin, which can lead to acne.
8792 2018-05-15 04:23:38 Google California oil production or dirtiest oil in North America you will get the same results

8798 2018-05-15 04:22:36 @JHarden13 For The morning and through out the day I want you and team to drink Ginger Green tea and take Coconut oil with a flush of water periodically. Green tea will help conserve any muscle loss and oil will help your brainfunction. L thiamine will get oils faster to cells.

8800 2018-05-15 04:22:17 The land does not belong to Israel.  Israel occupation is illegal the 'border' fence is on Palestinian land.  Israel murders Palelstinians solely because they covet the Palestinians Land, Oil and Water.
8801 2018-05-15 04:22:07 Go to target and get the essential oil kit with tea tree, peppermint, lavender, and eucalyptus for $19.00. That's better than buying $8.00 individual bottles.

8805 2018-05-15 04:21:23 Mr Trump.   Please make Saudi Arabia flood the market with oil because of what we are doing for them. It would drop it to 60 a barrel and preserve the extra tax dollars you gave us.  You can pull this off easy.

8817 2018-05-15 04:18:49 His rallies are nothing more that con job like a snake oil salesman. Dt tells them what to think & doesn’t mention what he don’t want them to think abt. Like for instance his manufacturing in Mexico Bangladesh & China and how he’s not moving them to America to employ Americans.

Nonintersecting: rivalrousness, abstraction level (data can represent oil).
8821 2018-05-15 04:18:20 Put some essential oil on and watch a tv show. That helps me from getting sick with anxiety.
8822 2018-05-15 04:18:09 The problem for #Jews isn't being "chosen" but steadfastly defending themselves. Jews fought to the death against Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, Romans but all of  Europe except Britain & USSR fell to Nazis. Arabs were colonized or sold out for oil. Israel makes them feel ashamed

I was looking for the oil & brush for her hair & she kept asking me questions & I said firmly “Stop! give me a second!” & she said “I just want to talk to you”
8832 2018-05-15 04:16:16 I would do that then.  They tend to check out your car for you while you get an oil change too so I would get that done first and see what they have to say.  Cars are tricky
8833 2018-05-15 04:16:05 @Rick_Stein You talk about use of Coconut Oil in Curry Dishes from Kerala. I would prefer use of Extra Virgin Coconut Oil in these dishes. What do you suggest?

8836 2018-05-15 04:15:41 Do u study macro around oil & gas supply / demand ? Demand of oil is up 2% and with OPEC tightening crude is touching 80$/b. Pls invest time in reading up! Congress could've diversified energy dependence much earlier.

8850 2018-05-15 04:12:31 Just a question... Does anyone know of a company that sells CBD oil at a decent price? I really want to see if it'll work for me without going broke.
8851 2018-05-15 04:12:25 Probably find human masses, due to over population in 3rd /2nd World cont.have to expand because of resources, and have their beady eyes on a supposedly better life, Water will replace oil as the #1 commodity in most parts, what we take for granted, half the world wants.

8866 2018-05-15 04:09:39 Yeah... this is definitely one of those "we laugh because otherwise we'd cry" sort of situations. I can't wait until homeopathy goes the way of literal snake oil in the public perception.
8867 2018-05-15 04:09:32 yes.  meditation music, mantras, relaxation response, lavender spray, lavender oil,  even this music ( weightless by morconi - reduces anxiety by 65 %)  tai chi, and qigong,  I've learned so much to help process stress

8870 2018-05-15 04:08:46 I take biotin & folic acid, only wash twice a week and use a t shirt to dry it instead of a towel cuz less breakage. And I coat it coconut oil every time I wash, about a quarter size rubbed between my hands just don’t do roots
8871 2018-05-15 04:08:41 Or what’s it like to put on matte foundation and 282726262829393 pounds of setting powder and spray it all down with setting spray only to have it eaten away in 3 hours by the oil on ur face :D
8872 2018-05-15 04:08:35 Ohh, and us Americans are guilty of just as much, I'm sure, but our definition is usually Oil . . . Err, I mean defense.

You trade Fx & oil.. Es too?
8874 2018-05-15 04:08:17 It’s the Russian plan to reap the riches but he has to raise oil to $100 per barrel. The GOP are sitting by letting Trump rape America.

Trumpy ain’t got a hair on his ass if he doesn’t shut down those Obama pipelines!
8878 2018-05-15 04:07:29 It's struggling to stay above $70 per barrel, where historically in recent years it has floated above $100. I'm talking about crude oil prices, not your local petrol prices. When crude oil price falls, Petronas coffers dry up, plus 1MDB and other mismanagement, GST is inevitable.

8889 2018-05-15 04:06:07 Serious question though.... and off topic....
pretty deep question...

what do you think oil really is?

how do you think it got down in earth?

8896 2018-05-15 04:05:04 USA uses quite a bit more than it produces. Other countries pay a lot more than Americans for petroleum (gas), so it doesn't make sense for USA oil producers to sell in the local market.

8903 2018-05-15 04:03:51 Hey, you commercial truckers who voted for #Trump, how do like those rising gas prices? #Trumps  threw you under the truck. His best RUSSIAN buddy Putin thrives on higher oil prices. It was known that Trump's withdrawal from Iran Nuclear Deal would sharply raise oil prices.

8905 2018-05-15 04:03:33 I read cbd oil is really helpful with a vegan diet, juicing and stuff, hope she gets better 
8906 2018-05-15 04:03:27 That makes sense. But still why a 15% increase in a month? There have been no storms in the Gulf. No bridges washed out. No refinery fires. No oil tanker spills. No platforms in the Gulf exploding. It seems irrational without an obvious cause.
8907 2018-05-15 04:03:13 1/3 when it gets to 73..i.e if it gets to 73 you will not short it ...instead will be looking for 80.:). were'nt some folks saying 70 or 71  would be a great short..and now the goal post is higher..reality is the price is going to collapse ..
8908 2018-05-15 04:03:10 Paragon fish oil is excellent. Wild Boar is more difficult to eat than elk and bison, but I don’t typically cover what’s easy. You can cover that, if you like.

8928 2018-05-15 03:59:57 So @mayorgregor burns jet fuel to NYC to trash Canada and not a word on USA plans to re-open wilderness to oil drilling in Alaska, home of Exxon Valdez. It’s not about climate or safety - you’re purely about vanity and greed.

8941 2018-05-15 03:58:34 I think why some countries do is they want to use them as a deterrent to stop the West invading them under the guise of bringing Democracy all the while wanting to steal their oil, minerals, assets, Lucky theres no ban on Guard dogs in our World..

Your tweets, despite their objectively low quality, get more views than the exhibits I make, or the papers we write

Why are you doing this
8948 2018-05-15 03:57:18 Massage a few drops of coconut oil around the eyes to get rid off dark circles.
8949 2018-05-15 03:57:04 Yes, oil once heated - gets hydrogenated - shouldn’t be used again to re-fry. We use it only once & dispose it off.

8969 2018-05-15 03:54:04 i used to mix baking soda with water and leave it on for like 10 minutes (or until it was dry) and it definitely helped with oil and didnt make me more sensitive (altho u have to moisturize after it does dry your skin out)
8970 2018-05-15 03:54:00 Slight miscalculation in who grows their food, services their yachts and produces oil and goods.

8972 2018-05-15 03:53:50 Oil prices are skyrocketing at present. What economic difficulty are you talking about ? We all know which group is paying 100% of the taxes.
8973 2018-05-15 03:53:47 crazy idea but maybe the presence of the oil industry and the terrible state of the louisiana economy are... related.

8981 2018-05-15 03:52:59 There’s way to many government subsidies and in many forms from agriculture to oil and gas to discounts on Minning land. When you look at the value from spaceX vs NASA, and Tesla vs every other car, there is no comparable value proposition.

9115 2018-05-15 03:36:46 I didn’t know. Just tried it with some olive oil, thyme, sage and peppercorns. But yes! Worked well!
9116 2018-05-15 03:36:40 Its like mixing oil and water!!!!!
9117 2018-05-15 03:36:36 I definitely need to get a better drying system than air drying.
It's probably been 10 months since I washed all this shit.
I'll keep the lanolin oil in mind
9118 2018-05-15 03:36:34 if you take the razor out of the shower and rest it in a small amount of cooking oil it wont rust and will last way longer...it's usually the rust that makes it really blunt, & it's the oil that stops it from rusting...

9123 2018-05-15 03:36:10 All the meddling to get the oil in the past has been what has destabilized the Middle East in the first place. If our countries spent as much money, time, and energy on moving away from fossil fuels and helping rather than war, well the whole planet would be better for it.
9124 2018-05-15 03:35:45 Prior Palestinian leaders seemed incapable of stating unambiguously  that Israel has the right to exist.  But I think the US has been thinking more broadly than Hamas and looking at the region—other Muslim-inlfluenced nations.  Priorities =Oil?  Israeli security? Nuclear wpns?

9127 2018-05-15 03:35:36 That is what all those private trips Jared was taking was for. They bought into Rosneft and knw that high oil prices are Russia's main economic driver. Not hard to see if you aren't blind. Plus the firings and jailing of all the ministers of oil right after those meetings.

9136 2018-05-15 03:34:28 And that cost can be calc from business plan(target oil selling price). In SA it must include the cost of almost everything (~70$)

9143 2018-05-15 03:33:33 If you call 45 an incompetent fool in this context, I strongly disagree. From the “destruction of American democracy and institutions and messing up Middle East to help war on low oil prices” point of view he has been anything but incompetent.

9211 2018-05-15 03:25:28 When BP spilled 4.2 million barrels of oil into the Gulf coast, the company sent a workforce of almost exclusively African-American inmates to clean up the toxic spill while community members, many of whom were out-of-work fisherman, struggled to make ends meet.
9212 2018-05-15 03:25:04 I’ve tried coconut oil in every instance they claim it’ll work wonders and it never does. I’m always unimpressed. Stretch marks, diaper rash, cuticle softener, cradle cap, Ive eaten it, cooked with it, etc. I’ll stick with my triple paste, bio oil, and EVOO.
9213 2018-05-15 03:24:55 同じくwトリビアは覚えているけれど、青年はぼんやりとしか……w  OILは衝撃でしたww
9214 2018-05-15 03:24:52 Jews use loads of stuff that were made in Germany Poland Turkey. Oil from Arabs etc etc. There is nothing wrong with that.
9215 2018-05-15 03:24:51 I am in my early thirties, tissue oil does a world of wonders for many things on your skin. I use a little on my face instead of creams every night. Day time you should always use something with at least 15SPF. And don't be scared to start using an anti-wrinkle eye cream from 28+

9220 2018-05-15 03:23:40 Bartrand likes to make me deal with the harbormaster. That man always smells like cod liver oil.
9221 2018-05-15 03:23:38 You do realize that's an opinion pz, a biased opinion pz... And I am biased as well. I need companies to have money to spend on those technologies that you like to talk about. Don't forget that oil is used for more than energy generation and that if we don't, someone else will
9222 2018-05-15 03:23:26 Good work feigns call it oil base
9223 2018-05-15 03:23:23 Like, where you got a free app from 5-7 from M-T or $10 off an oil change and buy one get one free Krispy Kreme glazed dozen? And it was all in a little flip book thing you sold for $15 to raise money for band or track or cheerleading?

Its puzzling to me why @RachelNotley has the power to yap about oil..

9240 2018-05-15 03:19:44 Don't mean to sound impractical but you know the video does clearly say that oil price will be down on the first day that PH is in power. So kalau org tagih, you can blame them kah?

9242 2018-05-15 03:19:34 My answer is you did not take the oil of Canada from the Indians legally and all the children you stole and raped you pay for now! Of course “you” are not guilty and I can agree with some of your ideas.
9243 2018-05-15 03:19:29 Finally figured out how to turn down the brightness on my essential oil defuser and now I’m never turning it off every again

9249 2018-05-15 03:18:42 Trust #God, children. If you've sown seed in His Kingdom, your cruise of oil & barrel of meal will NOT run out.

Then u can focus on what u WANT from God, not what u need! 

That's not greed - it's GROWTH. Just take ownership of what God says is yours & KNOW who u are in Him!
9250 2018-05-15 03:18:39 Correct.
It’s not the incremental labor cost, but what other technologies start to have a better return on investment. Like oil. When prices go up, it makes the cost of exploration less risky. 
This is why cashiers are changing into kiosks. At $8/hr, people are cheaper, not $12.

9252 2018-05-15 03:18:16 Economy gets better for stockholders, oil/gas demand goes up, price goes up, costs to transport goods (feed, meat and produce, imports, timber, construction goods, etc.) increase, grocery costs go up.  But do employers pay their employees enough to keep up with the COL?  NO.
9253 2018-05-15 03:18:03 I am so desperate to be healthy again by prom I got a oil defuser and I swear to god it’s making it easier to breathe. I am now converting to only herbal medicine hmu if you need a witch doctor
9254 2018-05-15 03:17:57 BJP failed to prove a good governance in term of Oil price rise. At least learn from congress the rates of  petrol aroud 60 per ltr when crud oil is $109 per barrel @BJP4India @INCIndia

9258 2018-05-15 03:17:07 So um. I got fake nails. I just peeled them off. Ur not supposed to do that cuz it’s bad. @nailogical halp. Will the jojoba oil work to bring my natural nails back to life? Fakey nails are too expensive. I gotta get right.
9259 2018-05-15 03:16:40 I don’t know anyone in oil and gas that would logically deny climate change. It’s recorded in the rock record. That said, the real question is around effectiveness and impact of policies and actions - and who pays the price with no effect.
9260 2018-05-15 03:16:38 Sabi ng TL ko kanina parang kaliligo ko lang kahit paend na ang shift.

Parang wet look raw yung hair ko. Sasagot sana ako ng “hindi ako naliligo, oil ng ulo ko yan. ”
9261 2018-05-15 03:16:29 Three of the “have-not” provinces have bans on hydraulic fracturing and refuse to exploit their natural gas resources. Quebec alone imports $13 billion in foreign oil every year, blocked the Energy East Pipeline, and exempted a CO2 belching cement plant from carbon taxes.

9284 2018-05-15 03:12:37 Oil, butter, and clap these cheeks. That’s the process. Trust the process.
9285 2018-05-15 03:12:32 Getting an oil change and I dropped my purse and all my snacks fell out ! I stay embarrassing my self 
9286 2018-05-15 03:12:29 Just seeing thieves, liars, and despots prevail. They got upset because they were racist, religious hypocrites, and heavily invested in oil interests and do not want to loose their money. They don’t care about anyone but themselves, and can’t figure why they aren’t the center.

.
Minsky was wrong about 70's inflation, which was caused by oil.

One can support government job creation and a commitment to full employment and higher wages without supporting Minsky or his flawed JG.

9314 2018-05-15 03:07:59 Trump isn’t giving anyone a fishing pole. Not even the people who voted for him. He’s helping corporations and his wealthy pals get richer. He’s destroying the earth by helping his oil Barron friends drill anyplace and destroy animal habitats
9315 2018-05-15 03:07:37 Speakers encourage folks to visit Kern County. 75% of California’s oil & gas comes from Kern. It is also the center of CRPE’s organizing. Understanding the lives & stories of Kern residents is essential to understanding the impacts of oil & gas, and why fighting matters so much.

9321 2018-05-15 03:06:47 Trump is all conflict and no solutions. Everywhere he goes he creates problems. He loves shedding oil on fires or where there are no fires to create one. It is the story of his life. And now the world has to deal with it.

Mix ingredients together in a bowl until a gritty paste forms. If too thin, add more sugar; if too thick, add more olive oil/honey. Store sealed in the refrigerator for 2-3weeks. To apply, swab the lips with scrub. Leave for 5min, rinse off apply a light lip balm

9433 2018-05-15 02:50:16 Consider the big picture. Putin and the Saudis have green lighted the Trump/Netanyahu push against Iran or it wouldn’t be happening. Oil prices are their end game.
9434 2018-05-15 02:49:54 I have no narrative. I believe that Omar is a grifter on the same level as a snake oil salesman. He knows that he will not win. He's just in it to skim some campaign donations. You know like the bible channels say... "sew a seed" AKA False hope.

9511 2018-05-15 02:37:41 a lot of the recipes have essential oil in them, but you don’t need that, just have a carrier oil like olive or coconut, I prefer coconut because olive oil has a slightly icky smell + taste compared to coconut and you’ll def taste at least a LITTLE and def smell it

9551 2018-05-15 02:31:51 A long time ago I got introduced to olive oil as skincare, and I have to admit I love it so.  Just...grocery store olive oil in a lotion bottle, used at night at first until your skin adjust to absorbing it.  Sounds crazy, but hand to god Ive never had anything work better.

9631 2018-05-15 02:20:53 Does anyone know how to get the compliance and reporting on safety pressure testing for its integrity? FOIA rejects all requests and politicians like Gary Peters won't request them when his hands are in water and oil.

9667 2018-05-15 02:16:43 he also merely touched upon centrality of massive decline in oil prices, altho there were plenty of arguments as to why govt was still to blame -- eg non-diversification of economy.  not mentioned is lack of diversification from 1945-1999, when Hugo Chavez first came to power

9748 2018-05-15 02:06:51 There are vegetable oils that mitigate aldehyde formation, like olive oil. Frying at a lower temp also helps, but high heat itself can cause advanced glycation end-products in proteins and acrylamide in carbs etc, so I've been trying to cook lower and slower.

9760 2018-05-15 02:04:09 let's be honest. That's a coverup for the real reasons. The dollar is oil backed and not gold backed. They want to keep the region imbalanced AND the IMF Is still run by Israel.
9761 2018-05-15 02:04:07 This benefits Putin's political power in Russia. Russia's economy was hurting when oil prices were low enough for gas prices to be at $1.50/gal in the US. It was putting him on shaky ground. This rise in oil prices benefits Putin's position in Russia. It's why Putin helped Trump.
9762 2018-05-15 02:04:06 DeVos is an extension of the admin bent on fleecing Americans, padding the pockets of the 1% with tribute paid to Putin in higher oil prices, and destruction of all that has helped America become great.

Literally just this AM, I had an appt to take my car for an oil change. One of my best friends needed a ride &someone to stay with her until her husband could get to the hospital where she was having surgery on her toe.  HER TOE. SCHEDULED Toe surgery. We did it!

9767 2018-05-15 02:03:11 I made smoked tofu the other day and it was surprisingly good. It really picks up the smoke flavor if you oil it well.
9768 2018-05-15 02:03:05 I think it’s unique in that it’s geographically unique. The people who live there, and all others across this nation who are farmers, miners, loggers, oil workers are unique. they would never be represented fairly in your world. But without them, the cities would die.

9784 2018-05-15 02:01:05 What’s the worst that can happen? It will either help you or it won’t. But unless you try it, you’ll never know. A lot of people say that CBD oil helps them. And you may be building a tolerance to opioids for pain. I say try it.

9802 2018-05-15 01:59:31 This is a very weak excuse Mr. @dpradhanbjp .How come oil prices in our neighboring countries are much lower than India  and believe me your Government is going to pay very high price for it.

9807 2018-05-15 01:58:08 For a puppet isn't obvious, but outside the US propaganda isn't that powerful, so its obvious to see, US oil hungry empire is exploiting Israeli people & their wish to return to their homeland to destabilize Middle East.
9808 2018-05-15 01:57:59 If you saw the pictures of the oil leaks overseas that I have you wouldn’t be using that as an excuse! Regulators here are paid just as well too hide the truth!
9809 2018-05-15 01:57:29 We also own the Printing Press to the World's Reserve currency, so debt nbrs are almost moot at this point.  Day of Reckoning will come when the world doesn't need fiat Federal Reserve Notes to buy oil. Hyperinflation. That is what ME wars are about...preserving dollar hegemony.
9810 2018-05-15 01:57:24 He knew the consequences of his actions. They were carefully calculated, including the human casualties. Destabilizing the Middle East was part of the plan. Raise oil prices and ensure the death of Palestinians. This is why trump is despised almost everywhere.
9811 2018-05-15 01:57:20 After not eating hot cheetos or drinking soda for 5 months, now they taste like gasoline and burnt oil. Not that I've ever tried that but the point is that shit is prob not good for you lmao

It will pull Russia’s economy out of a depression. tRUMP and his cabal will get their cut. Rosneft stock went up 33% since April.

9876 2018-05-15 01:49:06 use peppermint oil where it hurts on your forehead,, it usually works for me
9877 2018-05-15 01:48:51 I am never enthused when the price of oil goes up because the bulk of the revenue accruing therefrom will soon go back to where it came from
9878 2018-05-15 01:48:48 I tried it but it tasted like motor oil so I spat it out
9879 2018-05-15 01:48:16 I didn’t realize that the largest proven oil reserves were in Venezuela. Bigger than here in the Dakotas? So, even so, in your estimation, how much higher than $3 gas do we go in Ohio?
9880 2018-05-15 01:48:14 Lesson learned, I'm not buying peppermint essential oil again. Will try citrus next time.
9881 2018-05-15 01:48:07 Ill take a read but sounds typical of big oil, banks and tech. All scum. Very rare to hear about Bill Gates and Buffet shipping the amont of oil only second to pipelines. But when the trains blow up a half of a town it not a big deal? Terrorists are licking their lips.
9882 2018-05-15 01:47:44 Hilarious too as he's an Islamist, Putin-loving, Genocidal dictator. Thank god he's got some serious oil pipeline action to make up for all those shortcomings!

9893 2018-05-15 01:46:03 @AlikoDangote Hello Sir. There is this small country in South America that is about to join the league of oil producing nations of the world. The country is Guyana. The only English speaking country in South America.
9894 2018-05-15 01:46:03 At the @APPEACONFERENCE oil and gas show in Adelaide? Be sure to catch Siemens Joachim Bamberger in Room C/D at 3:45 to hear about cost efficient, reliable distributed energy systems and their application in coal seam gas extractions! #APPEA2018
9895 2018-05-15 01:45:59 I need to start my wine down routine...beginning with my lavender shower, followed by my camomile tea, then my hypnosis + essential oil combo.
9896 2018-05-15 01:45:57 For years observers have been saying #Venezuela must diversify exports. And now they have. Oil is no longer the top export; misery is. #20M
9897 2018-05-15 01:45:41 Bunch of half steppers. Make it an even $1,000 a head or $2,000. Why cut yourselves short. 
9898 2018-05-15 01:45:37 Venezuela, home to the largest proven oil reserves in the *world* is a huge conundrum. The collapse has been somewhat ignored because of the prev glut of oil, but it's just now coming into the light.
9899 2018-05-15 01:45:33 Or how about "May they rest in peace and may eternal light shine upon them"? I'd get more rest in the dark, at least sometimes, thanks.

(I always thought that "he anoints my head with oil and my cup overflows" meant it overflows with oil.)
9900 2018-05-15 01:45:06 Check your Engine oil this morning.
9901 2018-05-15 01:44:44 Don’t like oil? Stop using oil. Lead the way.
9902 2018-05-15 01:44:36 If it wasn’t fabric I’d say you were right in. I dabbed up what I could & doused it in baking soda to absorb as much oil as possible but I’m not sure it’ll do the trick.  kids
9903 2018-05-15 01:44:20 Well yea with family money seems anyone could do that coming from oil and gas.
9904 2018-05-15 01:44:10 CBD oil!

9906 2018-05-15 01:43:35 Will the oil industry be viable after transportation both commercial and private go electric ?
What other major markets are there that would justify additional oil exploration ?
9907 2018-05-15 01:43:25 War is to the 21st century what oil was to the 20th; the pillar that supports the global economy.
9908 2018-05-15 01:43:20 Lol Roger, I’m about to drive to your house rn! I have the oil and new filter lol
Plus you’d be the perfect teacher cuz you always had patience with me in AP Cal 
9909 2018-05-15 01:43:17 And that’s the thing that always makes me facepalm. Are we really getting that much oil from Venezuela? There’s NO OIL SHORTAGE. There’s a ton in the US too. So why is Venezuela causing so much of an issue?
9910 2018-05-15 01:43:17 ~ about that encounter recently to be fair. But no matter who we were dating, B and I would still taunt each other in a girly way and nobody would think twice about it. My hands ran over your skin as I dabbed a few more drops of essential oil over your back. Your skin was ~

9912 2018-05-15 01:43:08 I went to Michaels to get some crafts for my son... and I ended up browsing through the paint section ( I’ve been wanting to paint for sometime now, but I can’t seem to find the time) and a 70-80 year old woman was looking through the oil paints next to me.
9913 2018-05-15 01:43:05 None of your soldiers are fighting for your freedom. None. They fight for oil, money, and control
9914 2018-05-15 01:43:04 @realDonaldTrump decision to move US Embassy to Jerusalem part of Trump/Putin plan to inflame ME for the sake of oil & money. No other plausible reason
9915 2018-05-15 01:43:04 Steve Kerr does no coaching man. He just stands there looking like an oil salesman.
9916 2018-05-15 01:42:51 This story is set to repeat itself again and again for those who bought Trump’s snake oil.
9917 2018-05-15 01:42:46 Not “fake” news.  They may be growing, but certainly not the size of England (approx 50,000 sq mi).  Chemicals leaking into rivers come from the oil sands themselves being close to surface.
9918 2018-05-15 01:42:46 Safe to assume if #Trump is involved, he’s going to try to make $ off of this conflict & the brilliant move re: Iran. Remember that 20% in Rosneft (Russian oil) that Putin “gave” to someone? Odds are high it was Trump. This would be the perfect time to cash in.
9919 2018-05-15 01:42:35 @AmitShah Sir, as a banker, oil prices are expected to spiral whoch will fan inflation. Opposition will make this inflation a huge 2019 election issue. Educating people of pressures of global oil prices is a must so that they don’t get swayed. Thank u
9920 2018-05-15 01:42:14 All the oil and gas in the world only constitute a very small part (the most expensive part) of such cumulative carbon supply curves, and the coal we can actually extract is also a small piece - 10/13
9921 2018-05-15 01:42:14 Is it REALLY necessary to change the oil in a lawnmower? #lawncare #lawnmowerquestions
9922 2018-05-15 01:42:10 literally my dress is ruined because of the gun oil but try again
9923 2018-05-15 01:42:08 Hey guys, I know that I said that give it time, but here's a tip, when it comes to oil pump prices you only have till Wednesday to bring it down. You don't need a cabinet minister to do this and this is the one promise where people put alot of 'Harapan' on.
9924 2018-05-15 01:42:00 Please watch "vincent" Truly vincent van gogh's story in oil painting animation

9926 2018-05-15 01:41:56 When your shipment of lava Rock necklaces come in, you put lavender oil on one for the hyper child. :-)
9927 2018-05-15 01:41:54 Rubbing Olive oil on the nail helps sometimes. And a very fine grain emery board. Good luck!!
9928 2018-05-15 01:41:51 Putting oil in your ear doesn't do much for otitis media.  ---  i got burned at the community stake for that one
9929 2018-05-15 01:41:44 Utk aku la kan, TS Zeti cakap camtu sebab dia tau oil revenue skrg boleh cover sebab oil prices tengah >$70 per barrel. Utk short-term boleh la kot survive. Tapi dulu(2015) TS Zeti sendiri ckp revenue base gov too narrow, unsustainable. Too dependent on corporate tax & oil.
9930 2018-05-15 01:41:38 I love harsh exfoliation. I love pumice. Loofahs suck shit. When I was a kid I read that ancient Greeks bathed by rubbing themselves in olive oil then scraping the skin with blades to remove dirt and dead skin. Gimme some of that.
9931 2018-05-15 01:41:23 My sister talked to oil how you would a cat that's slightly nibbling you
9932 2018-05-15 01:41:14 I always need to get an oil change but I always put them off, I'm thousands of miles over my sticker. It goes fast drivin 30-40 miles to and from work

9934 2018-05-15 01:41:00 The only way to convince me if some of that brokerage fee on the Rosfenet oil deal made into EC LLC  bank account directly or indirectly.   Hope mueller or you have some idea if it made to a Cayman island shell group.   Does it look like Panana Papers?
9935 2018-05-15 01:41:00 Cannae wait for some abstract oil on canvas of met cops looking sad abt something.

9937 2018-05-15 01:40:54 Does she also oil his abs

Meemaw lemme take care of that, you go take a nap
9938 2018-05-15 01:40:47 An example using oil production: this would mean using all oil in Saudi Arabia before moving on to more expensive Iraqi oil; and then using all conventional oil before starting to use US shale - Further, it would mean using all cheap coal before even tapping into oil - 7/13
9939 2018-05-15 01:40:43 Can't wait for my AromaTherapy Oil from Bali. Thanks @pons27 !!!
9940 2018-05-15 01:40:41 Mainly ceramic and digital, but I’ve dabbled in needle felting, used to do a ton of oil painting, and futz about with other random art forms as the spirit takes me.

9943 2018-05-15 01:40:35 Beard oil after I shave. And a Tom Ford scent I like ... But only occasionally.
9944 2018-05-15 01:40:18 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
9945 2018-05-15 01:40:14 The difference between high quality olive oil and low quality. Color. Smell. Taste. I hate cheap olive oil. I’ll drop $20 on a bottle. lol
9946 2018-05-15 01:40:10 Seems oil price control is with Modiji not with the oil companies
9947 2018-05-15 01:40:10 Boiled with a healthy splash of canola oil and a pinch of mortons iodized salt.
9948 2018-05-15 01:40:07 You need some Witch Hazel & Tea Tree Oil girl. Get some Hydrocortizone while you at it.
9949 2018-05-15 01:40:01 They do have structural damage, the oil/gas lines were destroyed by the protesters.
9950 2018-05-15 01:39:42 My beard benefits from my daily ritual for the face: cleanser, moisturizer, etc etc. plus I add a beard cream or sunflower oil.
9951 2018-05-15 01:39:42 I had two bites of basil, olive oil + sea salt gelato from @EatalyLA - ‘this is the best thing I’ve ever eaten’ was hanging in the air, when it landed on the floor of @JDougwine’s car.
9952 2018-05-15 01:39:38 Face oil
9953 2018-05-15 01:39:35 The Notley government has a plan to become independent of oil revenue. It comes into effect once oil prices rise again.
9954 2018-05-15 01:39:31 I want to put my senior dog on CBD oil. Anybody know anything about it???

9955 2018-05-15 01:39:27 Dead Sea mud mask, frankincense essential oil bath, and tangerine tea. I think so. #chillin
9956 2018-05-15 01:39:25 Mate keep up the resilience. Your battle against oil will be much easier in other countries. Where all behind you.
9957 2018-05-15 01:39:17 She went the extra mile and put the baby oil on it, now you blind cause the light reflecting od on that booty
9958 2018-05-15 01:39:07 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
9959 2018-05-15 01:39:03 Dude i swear you get an oil change every month and that’s way too much
9960 2018-05-15 01:38:57 After doing doing surgery on demonetization of currency, which led low out in production, unemployment , rise in crude oil , common person affected ,
9961 2018-05-15 01:38:49 Like a convection oven in that it flows hot dry air over food so it's faster than an oven but better quality than microwave. very little oil will make stuff relatively healthy, but get a crisp texture. With pizza the bottom was nice and crisp- no oil added

9964 2018-05-15 01:38:29 @andersoncooper As long as Oil prices keep going up, Russia is happy, it's one of its two major sources of income. Sanctions are still on Trump's list. It just isn't safe yet. Russia is the main source for Trump's income
9965 2018-05-15 01:38:25 Man I just made like half a cup of herbed olive oil dip and lord. I ate it all with some tandoor naan 
9966 2018-05-15 01:38:16 A good dishwashing soap or Mechanics hand soap. Both meant to get oil/grease cleaned by breaking it down
9967 2018-05-15 01:38:13 15/1 has long informed the price of oil.  It's not perfect, but over time fairly consistent.
9968 2018-05-15 01:38:11 Ask oil refill people.  Mine been trying to sell me preemptive service
9969 2018-05-15 01:37:58 Im off tomorrow and work at 1 on wednesday but i'm so behind on an oil change 
9970 2018-05-15 01:37:52 E15 isn’t safe for some vehicles. I don’t want it. Want to use less oil, go solar/EV.
9971 2018-05-15 01:37:51 Can they tax oil? The stock market? Big pharma? Yes they can!  We have given enough and it is time they start carrying their weight.
9972 2018-05-15 01:37:46 Somewhat but @ndarmour suggested coconut oil - I bet that doesn’t get tacky like some other oils - that’ll be next lol
9973 2018-05-15 01:37:43 Brent #CrudeOil crosses $78.5/bbl.. watch out for OMCs and oil exploration cos #stockstowatch
9974 2018-05-15 01:37:32 “You can’t produce without any oil.” YES! All of this.
9975 2018-05-15 01:36:55 Cashew and oil palm have very great potential to outperform cocoa in terms of revenue in the future. Let's accept it: we are not yet there. Agric being our macroeconomic backbone should not have a direct correlation to the definition of 'Third World'
9976 2018-05-15 01:36:54 1.  Black beans and rice with veggies (sometimes I'll add a protein like Trader Joe's Chorizo)
2. Potatoes, chickpeas, Mediterranean mix of veggies with either (1. Tahini or 2. Olive oil lemon juice blended together)
3. Ramen 
4. Curry 
5. Stir fry
9977 2018-05-15 01:36:52 I pulled an @antoni and made a sheet pan of baked chicken and olive-oil-drizzled veggies. Being a functional adult feels really great on occasion

9979 2018-05-15 01:36:46 Iran has oil so they don't need nuclear power. Selling uranium to Russia is the reason countries like Iran and North Korea do this crap.
9980 2018-05-15 01:36:42 Somebody broke my bottle (and won't admit they did it) of Peppermint Essential Oil and it is so fecking overpowering. 
9981 2018-05-15 01:36:41 Me eché el body butter en el baño y cuando salí parecía que me había bañado con baby oil
9982 2018-05-15 01:36:29 I started going to physical therapy, and I'm not at all happy with the office I'm going to. I wonder if my insurance would let me try a different place. The current place seems hung up on pop science and pushes Doterra snake oil at the front desk. Doesn't inspire confidence.

9984 2018-05-15 01:36:09 Well... try to eliminate oil combustible may sound crazy but We in Costa Rica think it make more sense than withdraw from climate accords!! We at least are trying to protect our planet... yes totally crazy thing!!!!
9985 2018-05-15 01:36:03 I am so sorry.  I lost the entire 35 page Board Budget Presentation for the Getty Oil Company in 1982, two days before the things was to be delivered.  Still remember how that felt.
9986 2018-05-15 01:35:48 Oil on the fire
9987 2018-05-15 01:35:46 Tesla is a company that disrupts our dependency on oil that runs the war machine that is our country. THis is no different than mainstream media causing FUD in crypto for the bankers that own them.
9988 2018-05-15 01:35:46 LOL. What a stinking pile of nonsense. Like holy crap, it's  seminar in coal baron talking points. Wind power is now on par with NG and cheaper than coal, oil or nuclear. Telling stupid lies doesn't change that.
9989 2018-05-15 01:35:30 Normally, before the elections govt puts a freeze on change in oil prices due to election code of conduct. In case if govt reduces prices it can be seen as inducing voters and can lead to litigations. So don’t read too much into this :)
9990 2018-05-15 01:35:00 "Chest beating" I guess you haven't been reading about Iranian missiles shot from Yemen at the capital of Saudi Arabia.

Nor the tens of thousand Iranian missiles sent to south Lebanon for Hezbollah.

Iran isn't pathetic like North Korea, it's a very advanced oil rich country.
9991 2018-05-15 01:34:30 So, American embassy moves to Jerusalem, Arab states get mad, start an oil embargo, oil prices skyrocket, Putin makes money, praises Trump. Is that why Trump did this? Is this what they want? #OilEmbargo #1970sAgain #TrumpRussia #FollowTheMoney #PutinPuppet
9992 2018-05-15 01:34:28 I'm having the hardest time getting quotes for this heater lmao no one has heard if an oil powered heater
9993 2018-05-15 01:34:21 There's a MUCH higher likelihood of success in striking oil with a rich athlete as a pretty woman than it is for the most talented, athletic dude to rise through the ranks & go pro.
9994 2018-05-15 01:34:15 Duuuuuuude these cramps kicking my ass rn and i need to do my oil change gahhdamnit man
9995 2018-05-15 01:34:12 Smelling like pink oil moisturizer and blue magic
9996 2018-05-15 01:34:08 YES! Do this, please! You can't produce without any oil. Rest...recoup...REST some more... then do what you need to do. #firstgendocs
9997 2018-05-15 01:33:37 Ha! I am also Canadian (not advertised). I like oil painting—they never lose the richness of their colours. It’s sometimes enough to mix colours. It soothes me. 
9998 2018-05-15 01:33:33 it’s not just a single example if you even wanted to argue this and did any research you’d know that cbd oil has been proven to help tremendously with many different diseases. maybe you’re too far to really know what you’re talking about
9999 2018-05-15 01:33:21 Me too. 7.8 quarts is normal they say between oil changes. 2015 q5

10001 2018-05-15 01:32:51 If you really want to take care of your health, live a plant-based whole foods, low/no salt/oil/sugar lifestyle!
10002 2018-05-15 01:32:45 I always make sure I tell people I'm "getting the oil changed in my car" and not just "I'm getting my oil changed". Don't want anyone thinking I'm some sort of secret robot impersonator.
10003 2018-05-15 01:32:44 When is @Tesla going to make a big, 4WD, high torque pick-up? Ranchers enjoy saving money and reducing dependency on foreign oil. Plus, if I want to go mudding on my neighbor's side of the fence a Tesla could do it all sneaky like.
10004 2018-05-15 01:32:38 Definitely keep sharing! Awesome to see that you guys had a blast on your bug day! 
10005 2018-05-15 01:32:14 PRO TIP FOR OILERS: When it get so hot out put peppermint essential oil in a glass bottle fill with water and spray it on you. Cools you down in seconds! And you smell lovely! #youngliving
