60 2019-04-17 23:32:15 3. If you bake a preference for cancellations directly into the exchanges, you still run up against the problem that stocks trade in multiple exchanges; BATS, ARCA, NYSE, CBOE EDGX. So I don’t see how you escape the distributed systems problem.

I am researching on #CYIENT, PEG is > 1 currently. Might get to my #watchlist slowly.

93 2019-04-17 23:03:54 Today I traded all my stocks and moved everything over to Kleenex and toilet paper ahead of the AG's release of the Mueller Report. The Democratic Liberals and Commie Socialists are going to be crying their eyes out or shitting their pants when they see who was behind this farse.
94 2019-04-17 23:02:57 This tween hurts me in the stocks
95 2019-04-17 23:02:12 today in econ my teacher was talking about stocks and asked us ‘when it comes to stocks, what’s the endgame’ and i literally had a moment of panic thinking about next friday... this movie is going to kill me #Endgame
96 2019-04-17 23:00:56 I think it was back in 2015, I wanted 2 learn abt investing & stocks. Very confusing so I didn't rlly pursue it fully. But it's always bn there in the back of my mind of s'thing that I still want to learn to do. I'm a visual learner + things hv too hold my attn span these days.

102 2019-04-17 22:58:42 I don't have one - not very helpful twaddle when looking at issues like house prices; stocks, bonds....
103 2019-04-17 22:58:38 Stocks and Bonds
104 2019-04-17 22:58:12 Why I’m not ready to short stocks yet! I’d be crapping my pants right now!
105 2019-04-17 22:57:07 Se não há combustível como é que os camiões que fornecem e mantêm os stocks dos supermercados/hipermercados seguros vão continuar com essa distribuição? Aí vai surgir a notícia que os supermercados estão com escassez de alimentos nos seus armazéns.
106 2019-04-17 22:56:47 Don’t feel bad if you have down days or a few bad stocks. No one wins every single day! If someone actually did they’d be richer than Warren Buffett or Jeff Bezos.
107 2019-04-17 22:56:43 @rachelstocks dont leave $CGC $CTST and $vff I have all 4 of those stocks been long for 3 months
108 2019-04-17 22:55:48  Found $PUMP that made all-time highs. #stocks
109 2019-04-17 22:55:48 I was quoting from the podcast but some factor #ETFs only hold the most value or most momentum oriented stocks and are concentrated to 30-40 stocks while other funds are factor focused relative to a sector and hold over 100 stocks. The latter is more closely aligned with $SPY
110 2019-04-17 22:55:46 nothing makes you feel like an adult like talking about decisions to buy or sell stocks with @JGuessAgain_ and @Dangerboy_Dancs
111 2019-04-17 22:52:40 Haha only the naive think that will matter. 95% of the people buying marijuana stocks are clueless. That's why the algorithms crush them.
112 2019-04-17 22:50:44 I just don't understand shorting C ( in an uptrend) when you could have made from 5 to 30 points shorting stocks already in downtrends (the healthcare stocks).
113 2019-04-17 22:50:15 The multiple on growth stocks is debatable & no right answer due to limited ability to forecast past a few years. I’ve traded enough growth stocks to know when premiums get too big to buy. I used to own a lot of SaaS stocks. I own zero today.  LTV:CAC is a good comparison tool.
114 2019-04-17 22:49:13 I feel like I have to drink a can of RedBull before listening to Jim Cramer talk about stocks 
115 2019-04-17 22:48:20 Another thing to consider is that most of the names are “farmers.” The spoils are going to companies setting up to make the “farmers” crops consumable.... just my thoughts... (how many farming stocks are there?)
116 2019-04-17 22:47:25 this older gentleman dropped GEMS on me about investments and stocks

118 2019-04-17 22:47:17 Vacation? They are working with their Lobbyists, getting lifetime high-paying jobs for family members with Stocks, Board of Directors appointments for Wives, and future board appointments after retirement, ETC. ......
119 2019-04-17 22:46:55 Been reading up and trying to learn how to trade stocks for about 2 months now and can safely say I’m no fucking closer
120 2019-04-17 22:46:39 Lmfaooooo I assumed you were talking about stocks not guns
121 2019-04-17 22:46:18 So why the fuck did they scare everybody out of stocks at the end of 18 with that bullshit.
122 2019-04-17 22:46:04 Lol you can’t do that with $300 but you can buy some stocks with that tho 
123 2019-04-17 22:44:51 While the nerds are at Pound, team USA is making a return at HFLAN this weekend with the all star lineup of Mamba, The Prince, Happens, me, and Zhu. You've never heard of four of those players but we're still gonna beat Belgium by at least 14 stocks.
124 2019-04-17 22:44:50 Instead of just the puff of smoke we have seen in these stocks lately - yes
125 2019-04-17 22:44:47 Bernie wiped $28b worth of value from healthcare stocks
126 2019-04-17 22:44:12 That's interesting that they are finding common ground in the laws required to do that.
You know me, we can talk stocks anytime. :P
127 2019-04-17 22:41:57  $200 trillion tied up in stocks bonds gold and cash. 

 Say 1% makes its way into crypto = $2 trillion market cap.

 $BTC remains at 53% market value we are looking at:

$55,000 per bitcoin.
128 2019-04-17 22:41:38 Isn’t that exactly what Trump did to us when he imposed his ban and confiscation of bump stocks?

131 2019-04-17 22:39:57 Told myself I wasn’t gonna buy anymore stocks the next couple months. Idk why I lied like that

134 2019-04-17 22:37:37 I don’t buy the increase on the bank stocks in the past 5 days . People are just buying the banks because they were the only cheap stocks left . People who can’t afford Apple , google , amazon , Microsoft , Boeing , etc are buying the banks
135 2019-04-17 22:35:47 Have a look these #stocks that reached record highs: $XLNX, $TXN, $AVGO, $OMC, $ADI, $QCOM, $MSFT, $INTC
136 2019-04-17 22:34:45 I wish my stocks would go up as fast as California gas prices
137 2019-04-17 22:34:18 DOA5...

to buy the complete game with all costumes and characters unlocked cost 1,290?!?!?  1300 on some digital boobs?

I'm in the wrong field.  I need to invest in the CGI Mammory stocks!
138 2019-04-17 22:33:51 I followed you on that ACB trade as well, but i also bought  load pot stocks today.
139 2019-04-17 22:33:41 I didn't realize when I posted about cannabis stocks that $CGC was actively trading significantly higher after hours. I alerted $PYX at $17.06 today. I do personally have a position.
140 2019-04-17 22:33:31 time to buy&hold some US MJ stocks, it will be an interesting year. full of speculations and thirsty peeps, US market is huge! Canadian market is peanuts compared to it $TRUL $MMEN $CURA
141 2019-04-17 22:33:12 None of the SaaS stocks are down after hours and they are more correlated to $TEAM than $STNE - this isn't the reason IMO.
142 2019-04-17 22:32:24 Will #Healthcare #stocks continue to crumble capping the worst five-day stretch since 2011 due to the fears of 'Medicare for All'. Will Healthcare stocks bounce back or will they continue to slide.

143 2019-04-17 22:32:16 I think this is like another big moment like 2015 when which groups you invest in healthcare matter as much as which individual stocks. Hard to know if this is a beginning of mean reversion trade or unwind.

146 2019-04-17 22:29:35 Huawei might have nice camera phones buy I’m still skeptical about their security scandal last year. I remember when the news came out and Globe stocks suddenly took a dive since they sold plans with Huawei phones
147 2019-04-17 22:29:29 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks closed lower as healthcare weighs amid earnings and an overbought S&P.
148 2019-04-17 22:29:23 I’m not clowning. I’m giving you some encouragement. I know it can be hard for you to see a red day when the stocks has been green basically every day for a month.
149 2019-04-17 22:28:27 How’s the second ness lose 2 stocks?
150 2019-04-17 22:28:26 So of course the 1% will benefit the most. They have the credit and collateral; they’ll be the first ones getting the new (fake) money and buy up (real) assets like stocks and property.

155 2019-04-17 22:27:37 US cannabis stocks will do most probably, the question is: will this rally be short lived?
156 2019-04-17 22:27:30 It only became a Ponzi scheme once the US got of the gold standard (technically in the 30’s, officially in ‘71).

Once the government starts printing money (indefinitely); the only way to retain wealth is by buying assets such as stocks, bonds, and real estate.

157 2019-04-17 22:27:25 One of my fav stocks of all time.
158 2019-04-17 22:26:59 The NYSE does not list “penny stocks” because it is a serious (debatable) investment institution seeking to create prediction markets driven by value rather than wild speculation/manipulation. Same logic applies here.
159 2019-04-17 22:25:00 While stocks could still move higher on dovish central banks & policy support, it's best to be in the markets w/ better protection for the downside, from now on!

In what is a very likely late cycle.
160 2019-04-17 22:23:38 Post close update after I did my daily routine. Stocks had an outside day today (higher high and lower low). I rate that as neutral. TREND STILL UP, NO HEDGES ON. Watching the resistance overhead at all time highs and enjoying the ride!

168 2019-04-17 22:16:51 I have 5 different scans I use to capture my universe of stocks. But the basic idea is to find high sales/earnings (30-40% or more) growth stocks that have strong relative strength (outperforming market).
169 2019-04-17 22:16:21 for example you tweet on LYFT being in 9 etfs, last week, was ridiculous. It was in many more active funds, that have infinitely greater impact on the stocks price
170 2019-04-17 22:16:20 Yes. Modern equivalent of being displayed in the stocks or pillory. All the billionaires caught on tape preying on trafficked women.

174 2019-04-17 22:14:27 Is 2 bil number off a solid source? So we should have a big bull run because US MSO’s can potentially now get bought out at low to no premiums? This is more bullish for CAD side stocks in that case lol if they get to buy off for cheap prices
175 2019-04-17 22:14:21 My uncle sent me something to get stocks.  Yeahhhhhh.

2009:  who’s trying to throw five on a bag

2019:  who’s trying to throw 500 on these weed stocks
180 2019-04-17 22:11:41 A whole lot of nothing basically. People want the same excitement of the STZ buyout news and run with every news that comes out which was at a big premium compared to last closing price too. Smart shorts want stocks to go up too, to fade them off even higher price.
181 2019-04-17 22:11:30 Absolutely. Load mutual funds in all stocks for everybody. Brilliant!
182 2019-04-17 22:09:19 2yr Tsy been outperforming $SPX for over 6 months (+2.3% vs. -1.8%).

If you are near/in retirement, how much leash you going to give stocks if they don't establish a positive gap soon? 

That number whipping around on your statement is your lifestyle for the rest of your life.
183 2019-04-17 22:09:13 No, I don’t. That’s why I disagree with Trump banning bump stocks the way he did. However, just because I disagree with it does not make it an invalid way to enact gun control.
184 2019-04-17 22:08:45 I don’t invest based on “if’s.

196 2019-04-17 22:05:47 If anything, this would ramp up US stocks for a bit as people try to pump the “next one to get bought out” but that would only work well if the premium was huge. If it’s not even at much of a premium then what’s all the big excitement about

269 2019-04-17 21:22:52 In 2018 if you noticed the overwhelming one sided positioning in copper, oil, and Nasdaq stocks you could have bought penny priced outs across many securities. The payoff was massive into year end after a few months of no payoff.  Remember, we’re not saying put 10% per month.

274 2019-04-17 21:19:23 With a bankroll of $100,000 you could pretty easily make $500 in the stock market over a 10 day stretch, and at least if your stocks tank you can sell and at least salvage something, versus if Giannis breaks his leg in the first two minutes tonight you're out the entire amount.

286 2019-04-17 21:09:58 1. In the past, it has appeared to be a good value investment with a high dividend and low share price (and book value).

287 2019-04-17 21:09:29 A) Recessions aren’t predictable. Every single shithead economist that news outlets talked to in 2006 said recession was at least a decade away.

308 2019-04-17 20:58:24 No wealthy person is hoarding money.. Because money loses value over time.. If wealthy people actually just hoarded money than the wealth in that family isn't going to last very long. If you're including the ownership of stocks and bonds as hoarding, we'll just have to disagree.
309 2019-04-17 20:57:40 WTF too much.  One buddy of mine's wife just had stocks that she cannot sell "vested," and was taxed the ENTIRE lump some as if it were "income."  1. No guarantee they will keep that value once they CAN be sold... 2. He paid MORE than his ENTIRE earnings in TAX to cover.

314 2019-04-17 20:55:13 It's not semantics. They are by definition not assault rifles due to lack of select fire. They are not easily able to be converted to full auto, that would require extensive (and illegal) machining. Bump stocks do not make them full auto.
Yes, they should be sold.
315 2019-04-17 20:54:57 Guess these guys missed the institutional divestiture of oil stocks. Latest is the Rockefeller Foundation.
316 2019-04-17 20:53:49 Sorry but bump stocks are so lethal, merely spelling it out can cause severe injury to the untrained journalistic professional bait salesman.

320 2019-04-17 20:51:39 @realDonaldTrump take a look at Home Depot & Lowe’s and home builder stocks.  They are directly linked to what the Feds are doing. People slowed fixing their existing homes and stopped buying new homes.
321 2019-04-17 20:51:32 You damn liar!
The tax breaks were ALL for the wealthiest in our country and it didn't "trickle down" to help the rest of us!  No the corporates took THEIR money and bought back THEIR stocks,closed or relocated businesses and NO ONE,NOT ONE gave back to their employers.
322 2019-04-17 20:51:10 $TEAM below 100, many of the software stocks are ripe for the picking
323 2019-04-17 20:50:40 The best you can say about healthcare stocks today is that some rallied off the day's lows. But it's clear WallSt now is terrified of govt cost cuts. Wed losers:

325 2019-04-17 20:49:03 Right, which is why bump stocks were finally banned...
326 2019-04-17 20:48:51 Billionaire investor, Ken Fisher, is on @FoxNews now w @TeamCavuto talking about why there's still a long term global bull market in #stocks for fundamental reasons
327 2019-04-17 20:48:23 1/7 I have been in finance, investment and mortgage banking for over 30 years, but started seriously trading stocks and options about 15 years ago.  Many people think trading is a quick, easy way to riches, but I have found it to be one of the toughest jobs I've ever had.
328 2019-04-17 20:47:08 He can’t exactly ban guns with the snap of his finger, but he can use executive orders to enact certain gun control laws. In fact he opened the door for any president to enact gun control through executive order, because that’s how he banned bump stocks.
329 2019-04-17 20:45:38 Analysts seeing stocks 5% higher on the year. Implying DOW at 28.000 by year end.

332 2019-04-17 20:44:20 Health care stocks were ending near their session lows, including a more than  2.5% slump for the NYSE Health Care Index in recent trade.
333 2019-04-17 20:44:13 Getting your money to work for you is how people become wealthy... but those stocks and bonds that you're not a fan of, is capital used to create warehouses and jobs for other people to work.. it's not like it's hoarded.. think of how slowly we'd develop without this system.

357 2019-04-17 20:31:19 How about this truth:

88% of the $1.5 Trillion Tax Cut went to the top 1% with corporations buying their stocks back rather than investing in America and many people were deceived by smaller IRS withholding, hence $6.5 Billion fewer refunds than before tax cut
358 2019-04-17 20:31:14 @SorosSonos you know nothing of you are comparing this to stocks.  This can double in one day.

366 2019-04-17 20:28:40 The Fishhook is the tactic for entering PEG stocks.  For me the problem was how do you know you didn't just top tick a gap that is going to fade you?  So I studied a few thousand of them and came up with entry rules.

371 2019-04-17 20:27:07 Even though I can't plot the 4EMA(High) on a chart, stockcharts will let me scan for it.

Agree with you on scanning... many of my scans come up with stocks I don't care about, but I'm familiar enough with the "hot" symbols that they jump out at me if they're there.
372 2019-04-17 20:26:32 Is that for stocks coming from Power Earning Gaps or for any?

378 2019-04-17 20:22:57 I worked it out on TC2000 when I had that.  @tradingview will let you do it and you can set it on interactive brokers charts.   My trading has moved beyond constant scanning for signals.  I now watch far fewer stocks than I used to so I don't need an alerts
379 2019-04-17 20:22:08 This is a little misleading.  Corporations are the largest buyer because of employee retirement plans.  Retirement plans are and always have been the largest buyer of stocks.  Nobody is buying stocks individually through their Dean Witter broker anymore.

382 2019-04-17 20:19:30 #stocks weren't able to generate any momentum after gapping up on the open and the #healthcare #sector continues to sell off. Join Coach Frank over on YouTube at 4:30 Eastern to discuss Wednesday's price action in the Market Recap #trading
383 2019-04-17 20:18:37 nice to see I got stopped out of $MO $GOOS and cut $YETI $WMT in the past few weeks while I was adding healthcare stocks, brb while I go fuck myself

385 2019-04-17 20:17:36 Really gonna start buying and selling stocks. Just downloaded Robinhood app. Anyone wanna learn with me?
386 2019-04-17 20:16:57 I guess Holder and Lynch weren’t available.   They are lawyering up.
387 2019-04-17 20:16:54 In other words, Japan's central bank will soon be the biggest individual owner of Japanese stocks.
388 2019-04-17 20:16:06 The whole thing is bizarre to me because I’m in CPG but not beauty and out of stocks are what we try to AVOID. It makes vendors and customers mad lol. Ultimately the hype can be outweighed by the frustration if they aren’t careful...
389 2019-04-17 20:16:00 Stocks end slightly lower, pulled down by health care sector
390 2019-04-17 20:15:22 The best investors don't invest in tech stocks. 

Warren Buffett only recently took a position in Apple. Before that, in 2011 he bought IBM - he sold it several years later.
391 2019-04-17 20:15:22 I used Acorn for a while. I loved it. After a year or so, I had over $1K in stocks/ETFs from just usual spending. Had to withdraw it eventually for an emergency but yeah...lol

394 2019-04-17 20:13:15 Milk stocks at an all-time low.
395 2019-04-17 20:13:09 World stocks ex US edge higher: Europe +.1%; US -.2%. US stocks will be in trading range until China issue & 1Q eps clearer. At 2900 S&P 500 in my closing 2019 range, only about 4% from top of range. Leads me to believe investors should be realistic about remainder of year.
396 2019-04-17 20:13:02 Stocks end mostly lower as healthcare issues plunge on political fears.

Dow -0.01%, Nasdaq -0.05%, S&P 500 -0.2%. Strength in some tech, transport and consumer stocks helps.

But anything medical-related is zapped. Cigna $CI -3.7%, Merck $MRK -4.7%, $BTK biotech index -5.3%.

Their goal is to find small companies that can grow faster than the  market expects—and minimize the opportunity cost of owning stocks that  stumble along the way.
404 2019-04-17 20:09:34 @WarrenBuffett is right when you didn’t lose YTD in 2018, instead gaining 13% in one of the worst stock crashes in years and you follow that with a 32% increase in the first quarter of 2019

I’d probably be a billionaire too if I had more money for #smartinvesting #stocks

505 2019-04-17 19:18:14 “Growth” has failed relative to “Value” stocks because the large cap companies stole away the narrative of growth (and unlimited financing) from the smaller stocks. Bearish indicator for those still holding out for a “Value” reversal. @EpsilonTheory

You are Bitcoin developer and am sure you have traded or bought/sold traditional assets like stocks/shares.

I have evidence.
509 2019-04-17 19:17:12 I don't know - this is extreme BUT if a white rep congressman said (in reference to the Las Vegas shooter) that "some people did something" to defend ownership of bump stocks we would be having the opposite argument right now.

519 2019-04-17 19:14:22 Well, that's technically not even really possible, but yeah, that's what I was getting w the quantitative part--we can control our use of stocks & sinks such that they do not deteriorate faster than replenish but that happens *within* not *between* 'nature'

528 2019-04-17 19:08:33 But it’s easy if you don’t have stocks, bonds, your own business, and your spouse has a another job too. Maybe you’re throwing in medical and charitable deductions. It’s sure not that easy then, it boggles my mind!

554 2019-04-17 18:55:38 When did WA determine income is property?
The only definition I find is in RCW 84.04.080- “monies” & “stocks” are intangible personal property exempt from ad valorem taxes per WAC 458-50-160.
I find no such exemption for income derived from sale of stock.

564 2019-04-17 18:48:03 Grandpa Commie is an economic retard. They pay nothing because they funnel the money back into circulation. They don't hoard it -- they either use it to build more business or to pay investors. Lots of funds hold those stocks, and that helps individuals build retirement income.
565 2019-04-17 18:47:50 There will be opportunities to grow for smaller players also.

The more that get into the game the more competitive the market will get which will eventually drive the cost of the end user product down to appeal to more masses.  

Smaller players will have smaller overheads.

567 2019-04-17 18:47:23 I have to say that it took me a couple tries to make progress on the short side since I turned partially bearish a while ago when stocks like $MDB rallied weakly after the breaks. 9 stop loss hits and scrape wins after the intial $BA win until I hit $CDNA $LYFT and now $TIGR.

657 2019-04-17 18:14:14 Spot stocks I can't do unless I buy big amounts. They don't move as much but with options I could find a stock going to move 5% and bang out 40-50% in a day or two. So it never makes sense for me to buy spot stocks unless it's under $1.00 which I am a bit nervous to get into.

664 2019-04-17 18:12:49 “We are late in the economic cycle”.

676 2019-04-17 18:05:52 Healthcare stocks are taking it on the chin today thanks to the proposed "Medicare for All." I might suggest making sure the Medicare we currently have is as efficient as possible before rolling it out to everyone. Just a thought.

751 2019-04-17 17:34:43 There must be no drought in jobs @DeanAntonioNYU @NYUfilmtv @JuddApatow ?  I'm going to vote @realDonaldTrump just for fun... I only can make money in the stock market and real estate so I may as well vote like the pot growers who are into real estate and oil stocks in Cali.

757 2019-04-17 17:28:49 She started out vegetarian because IIRC her kid was sad about eating animals and asked them to stop, and then they all decided to go fully vegan for ethical reasons. I could probably give up meat itself but not dairy or eggs. Or bone-based stocks.
758 2019-04-17 17:28:40 $AHIX .0011 - This is what happens when P&D crews hop on stocks. Usually stunts their market growth if they're lucky, and oftentimes just decimates the play all together. Good news is these crews getting weaker so they'll be broke and out of biz soon. Just my $.02..

764 2019-04-17 17:25:47 I am 90% in stocks 10% bonds, but also own our house so I consider that money in real estate. It all depends on your age and risk tolerance. Take some risk tolerance quizzes on the broker site you use, they should have them available to give you a good idea of an asset allocation

766 2019-04-17 17:25:30 I despise actively managed ETF's you see investing in stocks you know return dividends but nowhere in there is that passed through to the actual ETF investor. Someone is pocketing those profits plus advising fees. Best scam on Wall Street.

772 2019-04-17 17:23:04 If #stocks were random then it would be fairly difficult to exploit an edge, yet many successful traders continue to do it.

Are they just lucky? No
Inside information? No

Disciplined to the edge in their system? Absolutely

Think about that. Why can’t you do it too?

775 2019-04-17 17:20:29 I'll repeat my position on shorting stocks, which has been the same for quite a while now: 
Even if you short the exact top second, you're total gain is limited to around 21 to 24%. That's the most they'll wait, before more QE.
Meanwhile, silver and gold have 10X that % upside

780 2019-04-17 17:17:46 It’s so shameful, and what’s worse is people making $40k a year are avidly defending these billionaires in their spending habits. Reality is, they likely didn’t work to earn the majority of their wealth. 500 million in stocks works for itself.

872 2019-04-17 16:37:56 Ok, when I call for a dip, I am not talking about that day necessarily.

Read my pinned tweet on my feed.

I'm talking about the stocks next significant move, sometimes it takes a week or more to build.

Treat it as my current call, 5s or even 4s before 10s... When? Who knows...

901 2019-04-17 16:22:04 For example, my stocks are doing great right now. But as automation takes away people’s jobs, fewer people can afford to spend on such companies, lowering their revenue, which results in more layoffs, which escalates the problem.

904 2019-04-17 16:20:22 Have to admit that the Federal Reserve, our government/president, Treasury Department, etc. are doing everything they can to ensure that stocks continue to stampede higher - all at the expense of prudent investors and savers.  Very easy to embrace the bull.

910 2019-04-17 16:19:00 The actual problem Yang is trying to address is not the wealth gap, but the growth in economy leaving people behind. While the growth in economy is good short term (my stocks are booming!), it won’t last with automation shrinking the circle of wealth.

927 2019-04-17 16:15:06 Just 6 stocks have contributed to 91% of Nifty's return during last one year. Mid cap and small cap continue to fall. Nifty and Sensex should not be used as benchmark of economic health/performance of the country.

943 2019-04-17 16:10:27 You invest for the long haul not for momentary dips & rises in the markets. Machines do that perfectly well & average investors dont have time/tools to profit from the micro movements in individual stocks. What’s it been - a week? Jeez. Talk to me in 6 months!

945 2019-04-17 16:09:54 Carl, knows this market should be nowhere near these levels. Sky high consumer, corporate and national debt. Sky high inflation on housing,college,health insurance. Americans are paycheck to paycheck and we have trillion dollar stocks. Ridiculous market caps on all stocks.
946 2019-04-17 16:09:44 And.. I dunno if you noticed.. (you ignored it) the current "economic growth" via "trickle down economy" is only benefitting the rich. Yes, stocks are up. But that doesn't translate into overall growth

952 2019-04-17 16:08:02 I believe the late-1990s dot-com bubble was more a byproduct of the Greenspan Put that began after the 1987 crash and also interest rates in Japan being cut to virtually zero, which encouraged the Japanese to speculate in U.S. stocks (similar to a Mrs. Watanabe-effect).

957 2019-04-17 16:05:51 Conversely if you don't have proper exit strategy approximately 20% of stocks can be the reason for 80% of your losses.
958 2019-04-17 16:05:45 at some point value stocks will go up as opposed to growth just going up all the time
959 2019-04-17 16:05:32 @Recognia_byTC Be very careful with their recommendations.  I listened and bought one of their "Bullish"  stocks and am losing about a third in less than 2 weeks.

1012 2019-04-17 15:45:13 Because the bond market return has been zero for years the only way to try to keep up is in stocks. However even the most imprudent financial company would not put all their money in the US stock market. Supposed 7% gains were always illusory. Politicians didn't care.

1036 2019-04-17 15:34:32 I can tell you why... it’s because people buy penny stocks when there is good news out. The 10k didn’t really provide anything we already didn’t know.

1116 2019-04-17 15:07:51 The average trader fears volatility, but volatility is very important to keep markets in check. Volatility is only a problem if it scares you.

1117 2019-04-17 15:07:51 Yes I do, and I've made sure for years it doesn't hold stocks that profit off of healthcare. But most people don't have a 401K and they won't care when health insurance stocks collapse.
1118 2019-04-17 15:07:23 That is a potential disaster.  Hope you have personal stocks to call upon in this time of crisis.  #TeaGate
1119 2019-04-17 15:04:09 Thats not true, it just help you lower your price a little, but you can still lose. Also you need a big account to own all those stocks
1120 2019-04-17 15:03:57 My biggest losses came from trading options. I would size down on the options trading until you've got it figured out> Everyone thinks they can hit it big on the options. Stocks obviously have been your strength why change up
1121 2019-04-17 15:03:41 #ethanol production up 15,000 bbl/day last week but stocks fall another .5 mil bu, firming prices.

1122 2019-04-17 15:02:47 I hope good people don't lose a lot of money with the stocks going down, but then again, it's probably worth making some life changes if you have investments that only really do well when people *aren't* given care.

1157 2019-04-17 14:52:57 You use just one covered to cover "all" risk in trades also. You can play with delta, and expiration to give yourself up to 10 risk free trades if your volatility is high enough. Many options traders are now "all" financed is some stocks. They can't "ever" lose to even zero. ever
1158 2019-04-17 14:52:57 I appreciate the honest feedback based on your experience. So you think the only reason why these paid gurus are pushing low float stocks on new traders is from a marketing angle (which I believe Frank was also hinting at).

Again, appreciate the experience from the MM you bring

1235 2019-04-17 14:28:21 I didn't know video-game stocks and healthcare stocks were so correlated
1236 2019-04-17 14:28:07 However the way algos are setup if the tech sector gets hit, bios do as well.  And then when news is great for tech, biotech gets left out.  It's neurotically designed for the crazy risk that biotech stocks can carry.

1272 2019-04-17 14:18:11 I don’t think wages have caused price hikes Musaigwa. Government’s presence in the money market has strained the dollar. Remember they pay their external bills during the tobacco season. So they have mopped up. And the shortage of the dollar has impacted on the stocks in retail.
1273 2019-04-17 14:18:04 financials making a run for lower.

1274 2019-04-17 14:17:46 Thanks Frank, appreciate your data. As you can see I have issues with the investment media writers. Yes, your right. We’ve had a good run so far so a breather/correction may be in line. We need stocks splits to lower per share cost of the Nifty 50.

1355 2019-04-17 13:52:23 Agree, it's coming. Also gold. But silver will be a better return (15 to 100 vs 1300 to say, 8000?)
1356 2019-04-17 13:52:10 Or maybe you remember the late 1990’s when the market hit a new all time high then collapsed 50% over the next two years. Or remember in the late 1960’s when the market assumed we’d never have another recession again but then we had 4 over the next 12 years and stocks got crushed

The problem with negative correlation to stocks & bonds? You might just get it...

DFA Global Equity = +11.5%
DFA Global Real Estate = +5.8%
DFA Investment Grade Bond = +1.7%

1361 2019-04-17 13:49:23 That's the problem with value stocks - they can be portfolio ballast for years and then give you 40-50% in a week

S&P500 IT was 26% in Sept before the sector change. Given the rel. perf., the old sector must be more today i.e. close to 30%

If u think u are great at research & picking up of unknown stocks, u might be mistaken. 

MFs/PEs spend 10s & 100s of crores on research & mostly all such "unknown" ones are well discovered. 

What an individual CAN attempt to do is, beat them with better behaviour!
1412 2019-04-17 13:28:57 I would invest it in stocks
1413 2019-04-17 13:28:10 U r MEGA right on this. I used to see larry lurr and nairo do short hop auto cancel up airs with fox between stocks. I could NEVER. In ultimate, I did it first day and said “wow, so thats what that feels like” waaaaay easy. I feel like im as fast as tweek when I play!

4 things you can do to improve your investment portfolio:

1. Emphasize long-term appreciation over short-term volatility

2. Diversify globally

3. Consider the drivers of return — small/value/profitability in stocks, term and credit in bonds

4. Stay disciplined

1589 2019-04-17 11:54:53 Yeah. I basically have current account with a decent backup amount for emergencies. I have a S&S ISA that’s working well and I’ve been investing in individual stocks on the side (up 150%). I’m doing OK, but always want to make more from what I put away.
1590 2019-04-17 11:54:34 Best investment tip you can give any young person when they start their first 401k in 2019: oil and coal energy stocks. The world is about to expand on these two products alone for the next 20 years. Sit back and let it ride.

1594 2019-04-17 11:50:08 I use CAMS, which is just common platform for investing in MFs. Paytm money, Fundsindia, Orowealth etc.  are also MFs only. If you want stocks, derivatives, MFs, bonds all in one then most private banks would offer investment accounts. I’ve used HDFC.

1605 2019-04-17 11:46:24 Do you know diversifying your portfolio is the fastest way to make quick returns.
 One should diversify with not more than 20 stocks in their portfolio.
1606 2019-04-17 11:45:00 Invest in index funds b'cos index always goes up (in the long run); index stocks go up b'cos more & more people chase index funds. Isn't that a self-fulfilling prophecy?

1618 2019-04-17 11:34:58 Your country is no different than any orher. Central Banks print money to buy bonds, stocks, & real-estate for the elite billionaire globalists. Then politicians like yourself claim success.

1626 2019-04-17 11:26:22 1/There's a large focus on basically getting more eyeballs onto $crypto--ie as more people learn about BTC, more will buy in just from hearing abt it. What about value? W a stock, you assess value from earnings, etc. Cryptos marketed as money are not stocks. They're non-producing

1635 2019-04-17 11:18:34 That's incorrect interpretation of what I said. I meant keep max 10 stocks/indices fixed & never miss a trade in those. You may or may not find a trade in these everyday but that shouldnt bother you. Trade only when your fav setup occurs in any of these.

Thanks in advance :)
1658 2019-04-17 11:02:03 Hcar n psmc are real winner..from December the volatility in these stocks are really profitable.
1659 2019-04-17 11:01:54 I'm not a VIX guy because if you get the timing wrong the option decay will kill you. Why bet on a *derivative* of "stocks going down," rather than just shorting stocks (SPY, QQQ or IWM) themselves? If you're a leverage junkie (NOT advisable!) you can get it there too.
1660 2019-04-17 11:00:38 I’m just using some really old stuff. Any decent computer store generally stocks it though!

1723 2019-04-17 10:01:31 GDP increase - great.
Should always be happening at about 3%ish.
Has IMPOTUS' average been better than 3%?

Stocks - wonderful.  Helps stock owners.  Results mostly from stock buy-backs from $1.5T debt handed to our kids.  LMK if you don't accept the stock-buy-back facts.

UK fishermen mostly not UK as gov allowed quotas to be sold

1732 2019-04-17 09:56:04 With China reportedly carrying huge debt(debatable), the inclusion of the govt bonds is surprising. Moreover, Chinese stocks managed to enter @MSCI_Inc with expected inflows to the tune of $80 billions despite the recent commentaries on China's slowdown.
1733 2019-04-17 09:56:03 This is why there are severely policed glass walls between research and trading in banks. Just read the @FT, they don’t do this kind of thing (pumping stocks).

1752 2019-04-17 09:33:00 They're certainly interesting stocks but still too uncertain and over priced for me. If there is a fall back in the SP I'd think about picking up a small bit as a fairly speculative buy.

1757 2019-04-17 09:26:25 Those companies employ tax paying employees.

Their stocks grow in value resulting in capital gains taxes when sold.

Most of them pay dividends for which stockholders pay taxes.

These companies buy goods and services from many other small and large companies that employ people.

1764 2019-04-17 09:14:26 Here's a thought, instead of forcing kids to learn cursive that they probably will never use, why don't we teach them how to trade stocks and how the stock market works? Or how about let's teach them how to take out a loan and how mortgages work
1765 2019-04-17 09:14:26 No, but then I dont see pot stocks in that light. If you are going to overlay that sort of potential it just makes them even more speculative at this stage. Thats fine, but its not what I do as an investor. All luck to those that do. Its just way too high risk for me.

1786 2019-04-17 09:01:40 Superb article. I thought Bale & Kane were our great turnaround stories but Sissoko now joins them.

1836 2019-04-17 08:08:40 Which companies produce it? Buy their stocks. You know it’s the right thing to do.

1847 2019-04-17 07:55:34 I’be been working in the bank industry for a long time.
I don’t really se a difference between betting and buying stocks.
It depends, I agree with @emilcardell that it exploits weaknesses but I think that is true for a a lot of industries.
1848 2019-04-17 07:54:04 Union Jack DMs or else you will be led over tower bridge in chains, put in the stocks and have fish and chips pelted at you.
1849 2019-04-17 07:53:59 Not in my wheelhouse to speculate like that. (to pinch a phrase!) 
With the pot stocks I still think you are really only buying an agricultural commodity trader play - and I dont think you need more data to know about that sort of business.

Idiots"
1855 2019-04-17 07:50:21 BoJ has taken control over - FX, Yield Curve & Stocks and still can't do jack shit. I wonder why? Perhaps made up "virtual" asset inflation as a result of capital devaluation doesn't produce actual economic growth. Just maybe.
1856 2019-04-17 07:50:14 Discussing about where nifty / stocks or markets in general over LT will be headed is the most boring thing ever . Discussing setups / process /  improving systems on how to capture the move/ s , is what you want to be doing . Directionaly proportional to the bottom line.
1857 2019-04-17 07:50:13 Part 2 of 2 : stocks will be dumped, data will fall off from expectations etc. Then again demand for low rates... - In short, I am playing the seesaw without clinging to any bias strongly. As usual judging the sentiment is the key before taking any position.

1865 2019-04-17 07:44:18 And if such data does exist, great, I just genuinely don't know. But I worry it's similar to fishermen who say seals should be culled for depleting fish stocks, which of course misses the bigger picture.

1949 2019-04-17 06:39:15 Only advice I’d give is... if you’re a new trader, stay away from BTC because it’s highly manipulated, and does not follow good trading patterns. You’ll find better setups in stocks, as well as many altcoins that are not shortable (which reduces stop runs).
1950 2019-04-17 06:38:02 I don't think you people are having stocks. Just creating hype only. Cheap marketing.

1954 2019-04-17 06:35:54 money is going to be lost when things like "DelistBSV" occur.  If you can't handle losing money under such circumstances, then trade stocks and bonds in markets controlled by financier incumbents and stay away from . . .

1957 2019-04-17 06:31:37 China Q1 GDP and March activity data above expectations.

1990 2019-04-17 06:05:21 Some say that the US is less inflated than we many think because it has bigger high tech / high growth 'Sectors' than other markets. Adjust CAPE to 'S'CAPE and levels make more sense apparently. But you have to believe FAANG stocks can continue into outer space to believe that!

1996 2019-04-17 05:59:57 Okay, sorry, I lied. Now I'm done tweeting politics.

I'll make it up to you and tweet out more of what I think Pot Stocks will do tomorrow, so you can make some money.... Or most likely lose it. #bearmarket
1997 2019-04-17 05:57:31 Bitcoin has been the most profitable asset ever. Bar none. Doesn't matter about the 80%-90% drops. It always goes back up. To invest in stocks you have to do so through a broker. Not so with cryptos. 2020 could be the death of fiat currencies as well. Risky!
1998 2019-04-17 05:53:43 No, I dont short stocks.
But I am all-out due to bearish sentiment, and looking for bullish patterns to get back in.
Personally, I believe #FPC will have a great future, especially due to the cards.

2007 2019-04-17 05:45:53 I absolutely agree. Just feel sad for all the people who don’t have stocks or don’t have market understanding and lost these last 10 years (and quite possibly even more if they lost their home). If you bought IBM years back, you’d have won, despite all logical arguments not to.

2028 2019-04-17 05:29:03 Let me coin new buzz word.
"forever fancy stocks".
2029 2019-04-17 05:28:40 Bit of a myth about Sidewinder. 9L was already in UK service. No US supplies of 9L went south. All were from the UK owned stockpile. The US did replenish the NATO war reserve from US stocks to account for UK missiles withdrawn and sent with the TF.
2030 2019-04-17 05:28:24 I see a bubble, statistics for certain things look great, employment blah blah blah. It's only sustained by a money printing factory. Devaluing the dollar as the debt grows faster than you can blink. Banks stocks will drop in value, they'll cut costs (people, wages)...then pop!
2031 2019-04-17 05:27:51 Indian #Traveller spent $94B on 2B domestic+international trips in '18, (9.4% of GDP). At 13% anticipated CAGR, this no will go up to $136B by '21. Of this ~37% would be spent on transportation; ~16% on lodging & remaining on shopping, recreation & food. Which #stocks to look at?
2032 2019-04-17 05:26:31 made some pocket money last few days. thanks to a few stocks that surged over 50% in a matter of months. also thanks to falling ringgit juicing up those overseas profit slightly more
2033 2019-04-17 05:26:25 really wished stocks, investments, and financial management were taught in high school
2034 2019-04-17 05:26:06 Yes. I agree. And I’m sure some investors of BSV truly believe that BSV is a viable project. Why? No idea. But at least give them the freedom to make that choice. Brokerages offer shady stocks and they don’t do well. But at least they’re listed.
2035 2019-04-17 05:25:31 yo Joker looks BUSTED for Smash hahaha I'm so hyped to play him. I-frames with up-B, TWO SWIPES FOR THE ULT, Grappling Hook looks insane, dawg the fact his rebellion gauge charges automatically if you're behind in stocks or % is stupid busted I'M READY 
2036 2019-04-17 05:24:11 1) What’s scarce today is discipline. 2) BRK itself is one of the very high quality  stocks that is not trading like a bond. Implied P/E now is what, 11x?
2037 2019-04-17 05:23:02 No, 

but will be interesting to see what the Canadian E&P stocks do in the AM.
2038 2019-04-17 05:22:57 And I agree that they’re both sick individuals. But again, I do not believe the other innocent investors should be penalized. Imagine if brokerages denied the sale of TSLA stocks just because Elon Musk claimed he was someone else.
2039 2019-04-17 05:22:28 Dealing  TA with charts dealing  with stocks, crypto’s and etc is like reading a pc codes

2041 2019-04-17 05:21:26 As mentioned in earlier tweets, always best to hold stocks which we understand.. And hold good qty and keep adding every month as we learn more about the business. Allocation is key..
2042 2019-04-17 05:21:09 Definitely VVikas on weekly n Monthly Charts of nifty overbought stayed 4 long time.. but if u see it's daily charts it is much fluctuating giving various ups and downs..

2080 2019-04-17 04:45:42 Hopefully it's not too late. Was wondering if we were the next Newfoundland (in terms of overfishing and losing our fish stocks)
2081 2019-04-17 04:44:43 Nope, it's not.
That's incorrect.

I am a professional investor, including property heavy stocks.

Fair value is a function of expected future cash flow.
Capital appreciation doesn't feature in my models.
I seek to pay *less* than the discounted value of those future cash flows.
2082 2019-04-17 04:43:23 NOT easy for $KLCI to compete with other markets to attract funds , with CHINA $SSEC $SZSE #CSI300 MSCI inclusion , definitely will have impact on us , WHAT do we have (stocks) to attract buying ? BANK/GLC/PLANTATION/TECH stocks ?

2090 2019-04-17 04:37:00 Furthermore recategorisation of #MutualFunds Equity  Schemes  has crimped fund managers. Earlier they could chase performing stocks irrespective of the category they belong to. Now they  have to stick to their mandate, which reduces the chances of outperformance #nifty #sensex
2091 2019-04-17 04:36:22 Sir,  apart from RIL can we invest in hdfc twin also for say 15-20 years?  Should we opt for MF or go with particular stocks for long term perspectives?
2092 2019-04-17 04:36:13 Yep. And @Raytheon @BoeingDefense and @LockheedMartin will continue to profit off arms sales to the country behind 9/11. Slaughtering children. Starving hundreds of thousands. Dump thei stocks. #bloodmoney
2093 2019-04-17 04:35:30 You people you just wake up one day and decide to ban something in the market with lots of stocks in premises. You need to grow. #DayBreak
2094 2019-04-17 04:33:07 I have to see all 500 stocks ok ty sir
2095 2019-04-17 04:32:32 it's a result we expected, glad the homies here in Edmonton Millwoods made the right choice tho
at least we might see a temporary rise in energy stocks, Suncor (TSX:SU) seems like a good buy tonight

2101 2019-04-17 04:27:11 Or, AI is way over hyped
This is a method you’re supposed to let replace your doctor? Let drive you places? Set court sentences? Pick stocks?

❝Sounds good. Man, it's finally our time ta take the stage and bust loose! Joker's gonna steal everyone's stocks for sure!❞
2104 2019-04-17 04:25:18 Very true. It just occurred to me -Remember - 9/11 investigators found irregularities with airline stocks. George Soros crashed UK currency playing against currencies. What if Clintons fomenting international discord for same purposes-hedging against currencies, etc.?

2110 2019-04-17 04:16:08 Exactly,Plus fall in auto stocks like Maruti, Tata Motors, Hero Motors and Eicher Motors, in which #MutualFunds managers r overweight, also impacted their returns. #nifty #sensex

2114 2019-04-17 04:13:03 Retail traders are risk off about biology technology stocks.
2115 2019-04-17 04:10:19 Do u know rally in last 1 year is concentrated with few stocks ? As much as 91% of  #Nifty returns during the last 1 year came from 6 stocks – Reliance, HDFC Bank, Infosys, TCS, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank? That is why #MutualFunds Scheme has failed  to reflect index gains
2116 2019-04-17 04:10:06 -*73% of stocks are above their 200 day (no bear market rally in history has that, 0%)
*100% of all years that end green in the first 4 months, end green by year's end
*Inverse H and S targets 20% higher on Russell & Dow

Chances are (overwhelmingly) this rally will continue.
2117 2019-04-17 04:03:49 A) Biggest problem is I buy too much of particular stock instead of having a set amount for all stocks. I’ll put $10k in one and $50k in another.  Never works out right. B) don’t hold long enough, tend to exit to early if not moving vertical.
2118 2019-04-17 04:02:43 La recuperación necesita cambiar los flujos para recuperar los stocks. Es costoso y toma tiempo. En términos de inflación y crecimiento, debido a los shocks de 2018, los resultados no han llegado todavía. Pero los avances en la reversión de los desequilibrios son muy importantes.
2119 2019-04-17 04:01:42 You are going to see a lot of straight white male protagonists in games, because the last time EA pissed us off, we made their stocks drop by 60% so they won't do that again...see we are their biggest consumers and u are nothing but an NPC with a scripted opinion. #sorrynotsorry
2120 2019-04-17 04:01:29 Your logic is sound, but there is a lot of stuff in the Constitution. 
Keep an eye on Trump. He's already banned bump stocks. Last year Trump said Take the Guns First. Due Process Later

2124 2019-04-17 03:54:19 Qualcom stocks rose 23%.
2125 2019-04-17 03:54:08 Lamentablemente, el populismo es así. Pone los flujos a un nivel insostenible y se financia consumiendo stocks, hasta que estos se acaban. Así, el BCRA perdió 50.000 millones de dólares en reservas internacionales y nos consumimos la infraestructura.
2126 2019-04-17 03:53:46 @tailopez. Hi im a 16 year old with big dreams and high hopes and i have a question what is your opinion on buying and selling stocks and if you like it what stocks do you think would be a good one to buy?
2127 2019-04-17 03:53:21 NG is principally different to shares. Stocks can be NG by a loan.A house also but there are extra deductions available & far lower risk. I’m all for NG for new dwellings only. Increase supply is healthy for overall economy. Sitting on 5 houses in CBD drives price up inflatedly.
2128 2019-04-17 03:52:54 20% of stocks give 80% of returns in 20% of time.
2129 2019-04-17 03:52:24 Find him in contempt, put him in stocks on the steps of Congress. Rotten veggies optional.

It's late in the day, emotionally exhausted from ongoing over-exposure to the gop contagion.

Please tell me sentience, empathy and connectedness will do more than merely survive.

Is Warren Buffett looking back at you?

If the answer is ‘no’, don’t try and pick stocks.

2134 2019-04-17 03:46:03 Learn what “stocks are plummeting” means.
2135 2019-04-17 03:45:41 Yep. After a year, RBW decided to sell (and a keychain) pero syempre kahit dalawang songs lang go yan. The price before was around 800 pero lets say due to limited stocks magmamahal siya.
2136 2019-04-17 03:45:34 But it will. If the players get more of the excess money then the owners Get less. It’s stocks 101 shareholders get dividends when a company does well. The WNBA is the company and they not doing well financially like that so the players not gonna get more dividends
2137 2019-04-17 03:45:26 Well how about Congress submits to an annual audit&full disclosure of their income taxes financial statements bank accounts to include off shore accounts foreign investments, stocks royalties, gifts, property assessments? Can't demand his taxes unless congress does the same&more
2138 2019-04-17 03:43:46 Its trending number 1 in Korea because apparently soooobrang limited stocks.
2139 2019-04-17 03:43:41 Narrowing my focus on people that I follow the same way I do on stocks. Too much noise.

2141 2019-04-17 03:43:12 Putting money in stocks has been one of the best things I’ve done
2142 2019-04-17 03:43:04 Blue chip funds are primarily investing into large cap funds (Infosys, L&t etc). Both upside and downside are limited.
Do look at diversification into mid cap stocks as well. You cannot get away with high charges. May as well look at high returns. Good luck.
2143 2019-04-17 03:43:01 It'll most likely be a mix of the two stocks, yes. ^Liz

2146 2019-04-17 03:36:26 Turbo Tax, do you really think I have stocks, foreign assets, or bitcoin to report? You saw my income.
2147 2019-04-17 03:36:03 Best to trade this trend in energy. Oil up 40%+ for the year is a number new traders should notice. This is a signal.  Best believe this will translate to stocks of all prices to ride.
2148 2019-04-17 03:34:46 It’s only madness when the government controls all . Including your right to self defense. American gun laws are fair and getting better at removing “loopholes” and new designs, such as bump stocks. While still preserving individual rights. Responsible use is key.
2149 2019-04-17 03:34:42 These stocks keep messing up my plan  :)
2150 2019-04-17 03:34:32 IMO, real estate in main land China is like stock market in the US. I would keep most of yuan denominated assets in real estates instead of stocks. yield will be low  but capital appreciation should be like stocks in the US over long term
2151 2019-04-17 03:34:02 私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。

2152 2019-04-17 03:32:41 W/this positive China economic data & a UCP majority in AB, we shell see where were at in the market. If + China news fails to drive the S&P higher & Oil stocks dip, safe to say were toppy and due for a pullback. Could go the other way, Who knows lol Tune in tomorrow to find out!

2154 2019-04-17 03:31:25 Now imagine this: a stock on NASDAQ gets listed and becomes popular. Then other stocks start appearing with similar names to confuse investors and take their money pretending to be the real stock they initially wanted to invest in. Does Nasdaq get involved?

Besides, a short trigger and a belt has the effect.
2187 2019-04-17 03:00:55 Well they went very good! The rise in stocks lateley justified
2188 2019-04-17 03:00:16 all of our stocks should go up because China doing so great

2196 2019-04-17 02:55:08 Think it's fair to say that large percentage gains and declines in certain stocks is due to MJE either realizing gain or loss or acting on inside information.

2202 2019-04-17 02:52:51 Not sure why they would tie themselves to the performance of a stock. That’s a bold move. Stocks go up and down unintended consequence of a down market could be fatal...
2203 2019-04-17 02:52:13 What's useful abt the "winnowing process"is that it will really give new clarity to the stocks undergoing this.We KNOW Qualcomm has a different standing and Netflix is weaknesses we didn't know before:USEFUL.

2208 2019-04-17 02:48:24 Plenty of companies had lowered guidance projections so planning to lay people off then they get a cash infusion buy-back stocks drive up the stock price. Then to help to beat their downward guidance they decrease their workforce reducing their operational costs.

2210 2019-04-17 02:47:40 China stocks rise further on how to use please remember the hives. And like the bumblebee
2211 2019-04-17 02:47:15 After getting burned on $NIO and $UXIN, it’s getting harder for me to create or add to positions in Chinese stocks. ETFs a safer bet, of course.
2212 2019-04-17 02:47:11 No dude, China stocks are down on this good news & I will tell you why soon.
2213 2019-04-17 02:46:45 So China stocks up and s&p futures should be down right?
2214 2019-04-17 02:44:45 Hi if possible can you share your portfolio stocks
2215 2019-04-17 02:44:22 Sana sinabi mo diba huli ko mall tour eh rob galleria nung Sunday complete yan may wonderwoman batman at catwoman sila. Dami dun pwede mo ma complete madami silang stocks
2216 2019-04-17 02:44:21 UHHHH @SenSanders you got some spraining to do. Your taxes are a hot mess. These are not complete returns. We want to see where the income flows from and where it goes. Do you own any oil stocks. Why did you not post the final return you gave the IRS?
2217 2019-04-17 02:43:32 as long as a character isnt tiny as fuck like pichu or takes stocks with 4 moves like ganon I really dont care

2219 2019-04-17 02:42:39 I started on penny stocks almost 10yr ago. Got into normal investments just for security of some kind. But we have fun in forex.
2220 2019-04-17 02:42:15 Does this package contain Oracle?
2221 2019-04-17 02:41:55 It would be safe to assume so cause stocks like CPJ and MEEG fluctuating within a certain price range. When I was at RMOD for a summer job I saw Chris Berry name twice a day everyday because of trading outside the block out period and with large volumes.
2222 2019-04-17 02:40:54 Either way I never knew you were into stocks like this bro we gotta have more conversation about these types of things instead of Mario Cart lmaooo

2226 2019-04-17 02:37:15 I will happily replenish your whisky stocks if this is what we get in return. Thanks for the content!
2227 2019-04-17 02:37:05 You really don’t tweet much. I only see the ones that have stocks. I’m not a money monster, so it’s not interesting to me. I like the funny stuff.

2232 2019-04-17 02:34:05 Are you seriously going to show Stocks as some kind of gotcha? Really? How about looking at actual stats and measures like the yield curve, and income inequality, real wages, etc... The stock market is a shitty way of saying that the economy is "great".
2233 2019-04-17 02:32:20 Plunked it all down on Canadian Goevernment Cannabis stocks.
2234 2019-04-17 02:30:50 They’re not investing in themselves because they think it’s a smart bet like you might if you liked a company. They’re doing it simply to rig supply and demand to drive the price up. Stocks value should go up based on profit and projected revenue not because of buy-backs.
2235 2019-04-17 02:29:29 After examining my losses the last 2 weeks I’ve noticed that I am way too patient/greedy with stocks trading 60m+ volume. I need to just take my singles instead of waiting for home runs that inevitably fail
2236 2019-04-17 02:29:00 Everything except my stocks are up since Jan.
2237 2019-04-17 02:28:28 Personally I failed in implemeting this strategy earlier, but two important changes made by pathik i.e. trading only when price is above below previous day range and limiting to a defined selection of stocks will definitely improve the accuracy.
2238 2019-04-17 02:27:34 Ouch! I feel your pain, Lori. There is a saying that says something like this: it's okay to miss a trade, because it's like missing a subway. There's always another one on the way.
2239 2019-04-17 02:27:01 I made 60 cents today from investing $5 in stocks. Idk how y’all do that 9-5 shit smh
2240 2019-04-17 02:26:29 How cam they?  This would crush the market if they even telegraphed reducing their exposure to stocks.
2241 2019-04-17 02:26:27 Yep.  I bailed on $XLRE, $XLU and $XLV.  Defensive stocks are finally selling off.
2242 2019-04-17 02:26:20 Their own misrepresentation has turned against them, by labeling everything an assault rifle when none of it is...has everybody against it all. They got bump stocks that was a win they should stop now
2243 2019-04-17 02:25:57 So thru all ur rambling, u STILL couldn’t dispute those “cherry picked” small things like JOBS, WAGE , GDP, Stocks, military, Judges, ISIS!.. but admit some trade.  

Deregulating - energy, manuf, fake gwarming, Corp tax cuts (specifics), not AHA (was a diff POTUS). facts!

2246 2019-04-17 02:24:56 Joker is lowkey a pseudo Lucario since his gauge goes up when he's behind stocks. Sweet!
2247 2019-04-17 02:24:36 $LXV $IBB   we saw a lot of weakness in HC stocks -- insurers, drug co, hospitals. both etfs particularly weakness.  my personal opinion is this is good for Americans.
2248 2019-04-17 02:23:10 "He doesnt just steal hearts; he also steals stocks" - every smash ultimate commentator
2249 2019-04-17 02:22:43 Buy more shitcoins and uranium stocks to even things out.
2250 2019-04-17 02:22:14 I did. It was the math class only given to those people that couldn’t pass normal math as a way to lump us all into the remedial class & shove us through. They didn’t see knowing taxes & stocks as important, they just offered it to us that had problems they didn’t want to help.
2251 2019-04-17 02:22:00 I actually use it beacause std version limited to 50 results,
by splitting price range you can see 250+ stocks.
You get more results in each specific price range etc

2256 2019-04-17 02:18:40 Multi-fold.... companies included in the EFT will be impacted by the ETFs money flow.  It will also raise exposure to these companies and provide a vehicle for the masses that dont want to buy individual stocks.  Net impact will be positive for all companies held in the etf
2257 2019-04-17 02:17:27 Which stocks does the screener consider? Cash only or Nifty 50?
2258 2019-04-17 02:17:21 I need to get educated on stocks 
2259 2019-04-17 02:16:53 Boogie stocks goin down
2260 2019-04-17 02:16:43 It's all a massive mess and is probably part of what will contribute to our next recession. This massive gamble on stocks rather than on the companies behind them.
But what do I know... I'm just a millennial with 3 college credits in accounting 
2261 2019-04-17 02:16:26 Kleenex, Sorbent stocks dive with announcement of no capital gains tax.   #NoMoreTears
2262 2019-04-17 02:15:54 What a joke and no surprise Chinese data beats by a tenth  US stocks rise more than Chinese stocks
2263 2019-04-17 02:15:26 Presumo que si gana va a volver a tomar reservas del BC. Es propensa a favorecer políticas de alto costo para los stocks, como pasó en casi todos los rubros: energéticos, previsionales, ganaderos. 
Luego, otro pagará el costo de dar las malas noticias.
2264 2019-04-17 02:15:07 Over time, everybody gets what they deserve out of the market. Consistent hard work while remaining disciplined to a system with an edge = winner. Lazy wanna-be seeking overnight success = loser. Some get lucky, some get unlucky, but the truth shows over time #trading #stocks
2265 2019-04-17 02:14:24 Investment analysts on Wall Street, looking for reasons to push stocks, are likely to come out today using China's 1Q GDP growth as evidence of a recovery & proof the global slowdown won't be so  bad. I'd be very wary of that assumption.

2267 2019-04-17 02:12:51 Good for you. But you aren’t the owner of the corner bodega that YOU think is required to give a living wage to the guy who stocks the shelves or is the cashier. Are you going to help them when they go out of business? Liberals are always so generous with OTHER people’s money.
2268 2019-04-17 02:12:17 $IHI  we have been seeing weakness in some stocks within the group like $DXCM. $CDNA. today $EXAS failed on BO attempt. the group etf lost the 50dma today
2269 2019-04-17 02:10:48 Bernie stocks did well under trump is saying and his wife who gets half his stuff
2270 2019-04-17 02:10:36 Guys like trump make most of there money in stocks which you’re taxed at a lower rate than payroll taxes like us working folk.  Comparing Bernie’s measly million dollar income from a book sale to someone like you is apples and oranges.
2271 2019-04-17 02:10:25 $RIOT Strong watch for continuation tomorrow. Usually takes the lead on the bitcoin related stocks. Breaking $5 could send us much higher!!
2272 2019-04-17 02:10:15 the chains rappers be spending hundreds of racks on is lowkey overrated... invest in some real estate or stocks instead and double your money that you spent on a chain

2277 2019-04-17 02:02:53 Worst financial moves I’ve ever made was not buying real estate early, putting money into CDs, and buying speculative stocks. But so glad my mistakes, made me into what I am today financially. #liveandlearn
2278 2019-04-17 02:02:18 Same principle applies. You take risks in the hope you are successful but that is a risk u are willing to take in a strong market in particular. So if people own 30 stocks instead of 2 do the same interpretations apply and multiple investors be penalised for same reason ?
2279 2019-04-17 02:01:49 If cannibals eat all the stocks - there will be no opportunity.
2280 2019-04-17 02:01:02 @Bernie-you are ignoring that corporations are owned by people. These people own stocks and do pay taxes on earnings. Tax  the corporations more heavily than other countries & they will move out of US. Stockholders lose $$ and Americans lose jobs. America loses, socialism wins
2281 2019-04-17 02:00:49 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.  私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。１
2282 2019-04-17 02:00:41 There's a batman one that looks pretty cool but I have no idea see if a local near you that stocks them so you can try before you buyv
2283 2019-04-17 02:00:40 More like they want to get rid of healthcare and real estate stocks to free uo money to invest in tech again. Because healthcare and real estate are defensive sectors.
2284 2019-04-17 01:57:53 Oh yes they had that on her pre k playground last year. I had do invest stocks in shout amd spray n wash..

2290 2019-04-17 01:51:41 I paid $4 less a week in taxes under your lousy tax cut. The 1% and corporations are the only ones happy about your tax cut. And corporations used their tax cuts to buy back their stocks. Nothing TRICKLED DOWN.

2298 2019-04-17 01:47:41 It doesn’t make sense to close the hatchery fishery. The only good hatchery fish is a dead hatchery fish. To do otherwise does more harm than good. They are there to create fishing opportunities and be caught; not to replenish wild stocks.

2300 2019-04-17 01:46:28 I found it helpful for intermediate swing-trading time frames, 3 weeks. Typically stocks in momentum for the setups I trade respect this moving average. I'll switch to 5/10SMA for shorter time frames (profit targets), 50SMA/65EMA for longer trends (support/stops)
2301 2019-04-17 01:45:55 Ain’t got time to watch GOT these stocks won’t trade themselves

2345 2019-04-17 01:15:14 Hate guns.  But 1) no guns requires a social consensus that is not possible in the US.  2) what I hope for us no bump stocks, no automatic weapons or approximations thereof; and 3) effective background checks.  No one believes it is possible to take away your guns. Honestly.

2349 2019-04-17 01:11:20 Protecting our oceans can feel impossible to tackle: human activities and climate change have left corals bleached, overfishing has caused fish stocks to plummet, & biodiversity is in peril. But, @nature_org has an audacious idea that thinks about ocean conservation in a new way.

2360 2019-04-17 01:03:07 Salarycat Loki:  Stocks can't be down....that means....no soups!! No gravies!!! The economy is in shambles!!!

2364 2019-04-17 00:59:58 European stocks rose on Tuesday after reassuring data about the health of China’s economy and economic sentiment in Germany helped investors brush aside disappointing bank earnings.

2367 2019-04-17 00:57:13 US stocks rose on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ ending the session at their best closing levels in more than six months, as investors dissected a fresh batch of corporate earnings for clues on the broader economy.
2368 2019-04-17 00:57:11 Mike enjoys bragging about his "clout" though he fails to realize hes one of the laughing stocks of college football recruiting. Wouldn't let it bother you.
2369 2019-04-17 00:57:06 US stocks ended slightly higher on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 inching closer to its all-time high following a string of mostly positive earnings, while a drop in healthcare shares limited the advance.

2372 2019-04-17 00:54:21 Okay I don’t get this. 

Do non market guys randomly search google for stocks and pick up just about whatever?

I received a call today and was told to look into Fortress for a long position.

2375 2019-04-17 00:52:58 Even without the trade war going on I feel we should be at these same levels with stocks and production the same is all I’m saying I guess
2376 2019-04-17 00:51:46 Love watching my stocks rise.

2383 2019-04-17 00:48:30 My stocks ran out since Dec 4 of 1993
2384 2019-04-17 00:47:33 $STUDY “spread” in equities trading (stocks), as many may know, refers to the difference between the bid and ask on the Level II order book.
2385 2019-04-17 00:47:28 daming stocks ng pagkain 
2386 2019-04-17 00:44:57 i like the sleeper look, gives other people hope  but of course i rather keep my stocks than rock shitty reps with some bad fitment
2387 2019-04-17 00:44:07 yikes, you seem to be on stocks, leave my Del sols alone scrub
2388 2019-04-17 00:43:54 $STUDY similarly, the concept of “dividends” holds significantly different meaning when discussing stocks as compared to insurance policies
2389 2019-04-17 00:43:53 you topped stocks today with your tweet
2390 2019-04-17 00:43:40 stocks rise by 1%.

2392 2019-04-17 00:41:10 How about stocks?
2393 2019-04-17 00:40:47 You straight up on them stocks says you fucking with them foes
I seen them quarters turn to halves, and halves to wholes
2394 2019-04-17 00:40:16 Some people have an alarming amount of faith in billionaires. Folks, they're not on your side. There are no billionaires who got there by looking out for the other guy. They will throw you under the bus, back that bus up, and run you over again if it will improve their stocks.
2395 2019-04-17 00:39:00 Client responses to some of the best stocks that I selected in the past: 1) You bought another stock I never heard of; 2) I want to own blue chip stocks; 3) Why don't you place stop-loss orders; 4) You just got lucky. I estimate 80-90% just want to own whatever has gone up lately
2396 2019-04-17 00:37:29 All depends on the situations really. Technical Trader mostly, I don’t play high float stocks, only low floats (preferably under 10 mil). Risk/reward has to be there. Also depends what theme is hot in the market at the time too. Lots of things! Happy trading friend
2397 2019-04-17 00:37:28 $BTC.X $GBTC $MARA $DPW 
Best blockchain stocks not on Nasdaq, but on TSX 
1. HIVE Blockchain 
2. Galaxy Digital Holding (in Ripple, BAKKT
2398 2019-04-17 00:36:34 Why insane ?  Mainly japanese hold these stocks. If boj default this will not change nothing.
2399 2019-04-17 00:36:18 Start selling your Raptors stocks!
2400 2019-04-17 00:34:33 Let's see what they do come May 27. Wood playing undersized, lost Marcus Adams as well and Naughton could win a Coleman. Good chance to come in and replenish key back stocks and beat the crowd before November's draft.
2401 2019-04-17 00:34:14 Not a perma bull of anything anymore. 

It has boded well for me. I date stocks when the season is hot, and then move on when it isn’t.
2402 2019-04-17 00:33:56 Short term pain, hopefully long term gain. Most of our pain is on the production side. We just have enormous stockpiles of grain around. Would say stocks and production is 2/3 of the price drop of everything and tariffs maybe a 1/3
2403 2019-04-17 00:33:14 I really want to learn more about stocks
2404 2019-04-17 00:32:03 Will it also own tobacco stocks like MJ? That seems like cheating just to get a HIGH sharpe ratio but that’s just me.
2405 2019-04-17 00:32:01 Copy the @realDonaldTrump on this article!  It's time for the Fed to step up to the plate and buy stocks (lol)!
2406 2019-04-17 00:31:56 ok guys. i gotta log off now. i gotta prepare for the worst. i need to start investing in stocks. thank god i know about politics and business. i’m gonna hopefully get enough money for food there. if the worst happens.. then i won’t eat too often
2407 2019-04-17 00:28:59 I know about this lol I'm excited for my stocks  I keep up with Apple more than Apple users. The conference was a few weeks ago
2408 2019-04-17 00:27:55 If it ever actually became an issue of national security, the POTUS could just declare is so, nationalize the sale of Uranium and pay Russian whatever the current market value of their stocks are worth. Russian wouldn't be able to do anything because the uranium is in US soil.
2409 2019-04-17 00:26:51 I would rather be lucky than smart. #stocks #goldmining #speculators #Gold
2410 2019-04-17 00:26:35 Last time I looked at this was years ago when over-quota fish had to be dumped overboard. Is that still occurring? That's what angers me plus obvious decline of places like Grimsby. EU at least cares about maintaining fish stocks.
2411 2019-04-17 00:26:21 Love you Chatzky. Have a question about pot stocks! Please respond!!
2412 2019-04-17 00:25:36 Kanye is doing it rightttt..dont buy me gifts for christmas, buy me some STOCKS!
2413 2019-04-17 00:25:19 Nice call on yesterday's stocks
2414 2019-04-17 00:22:18 Volume was increasing towards the end of the day. Plus it Only pulled back 10% after a 30% gain. Most penny stocks dump way harder.
2415 2019-04-17 00:21:40 Unlikely to matter, really. Stocks are going up regardless. They will continue to go up until they stop going up. Too much World money flowing to USA. Also, lots of cash pouring in now, record amount in last quarter flowing to stocks. The train cannot be stopped.
2416 2019-04-17 00:21:25 $IBM $NFLX T-Mobile 3 big guys all failed ER. Market bathblood tomorrow sure. My thought weeds stocks will be up. But I didn't load any today. Will see what happens.
2417 2019-04-17 00:21:07 I mean, the liquidity of stocks, bonds, cash is >>>>>>> the liquidity of a house. So comparing one asset class to the mortgage rate doesn't examine the full picture. Your math is right, but to me, having some cash or low yielding fixed income is worth it.
2418 2019-04-17 00:21:00 FUCKING
HAIL.

When are we gunna do shirtless wrestling on the brisge of elden? The sweat coming from our bodies need to mix as we wrestle for stocks, dude. Jeez man, I thought ur dick was bigger than this.
2419 2019-04-17 00:20:33 Stocks enakuzino bazisela???
2420 2019-04-17 00:20:26 Trump, caring more about Raytheon than Yemeni children, vetoes Congressional resolution to stop US support for Saudi war. Weapons stocks will rise, more Yemenis will die
2421 2019-04-17 00:18:46 The worst part about being a vegetarian is that the only vegan burgers my local supermarket stocks is the fuck off spicy ones but the good thing is that I'm going to get a high tolerance to spicy foods and I leave for Asia in 5 months 
2422 2019-04-17 00:18:29 i cheesed 2 stocks and then lost lol
2423 2019-04-17 00:15:25 A absolutely love talking to the folks over at @etrade . 100% professional, knowledgeable and courteous. 

Plus, what’s better than talking about investments and stocks?
2424 2019-04-17 00:15:15 $SPY So if yesterday was (supposedly) bearish, why are so many stocks higher today?  The trend.
2425 2019-04-17 00:14:54 When do you think $BTC #bitcoin will hit my $28,000 target | #Poll | #crypto | #stocks #bonds #cash #gold #silver #art #collectables #realestate
2426 2019-04-17 00:14:40 I met sum1 who is balling for his age and he is an investor i would say spends time checking on his stocks and trades. Rich enough, operates in a capitalist world while im tryna uphold my socialist views. Though he gives back to the people who are in need. And im falling for him.
2427 2019-04-17 00:14:35 true! I wanna eventually get money from YouTube, freelancing, stock shots, and maybe invest in stocks. I think it'd be really cool to work for a production company at some point too
2428 2019-04-17 00:14:09 That too lol forex is different from stocks tho
2429 2019-04-17 00:13:44 All stocks have inherent risks. Cramer’s team does some great analysis, but people use other sources and own their decisions.
2430 2019-04-17 00:13:27 There was a time in the history of America when if a man beat his wife or slapped her, he would be publicly flogged or put in stocks. Passers by would stare and shame him.
2431 2019-04-17 00:11:09 Also, despite being a net 'debtor' nation, the US earns more investment income abroad than interest/dividends paid to foreigners. This is because the US invests mainly in high yielding assets like real capital, or stocks. While the ROTW is overwhelmingly in UST.
2432 2019-04-17 00:10:06 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
2433 2019-04-17 00:09:27 (And lil capped took 7 stocks)
2434 2019-04-17 00:08:42 And all the stocks that are worth while to invest in apple google amazon etc are to expensive you probably won’t see a good return until 15 years and that’s if the companies keep being as good as they are now also hit and miss
2435 2019-04-17 00:08:38 Except for that whole “right to life” thing that usurps all other rights...like the right to bear an AR-15 and bump stocks and other means of quickly taking away that “right to life”. Step away from the NRA. #Enough #GunViolence
2436 2019-04-17 00:08:30 @techniquant  
HIVE +7% 
GBTC +7% 
buy stocks.
2437 2019-04-17 00:08:16 It's not about the bump stocks it's about how they banned it they just went back and rewrote an existing law without reintroducing it into Congress I don't see how people don't see the problem with this
2438 2019-04-17 00:07:50 Stop losses are important folks. I generally use them for catalyst stocks and a few longer ones. My exception is for Fast swing trades, I use limit sell for those to lock in profits. - Please trade wisely and good luck!
2439 2019-04-17 00:07:48 Worst case scenario: you'd have to sell your house. If you lost your job because of a financial downturn, you might be selling at exactly the worst time. If instead, you'd "invested the rest" (emergency fund/stocks/bonds/whatever), you won't lose your house.
2440 2019-04-17 00:05:01 Asia stocks begin mixed with the region tentative ahead of key Chinese data including GDP, Industrial Production and Retail Sales; ASX 200 (-0.1%), Nikkei 225 (+0.1%), KOSPI (-0.2%)
2441 2019-04-17 00:04:08 Shit invest in some small startup companies, get some stocks, start looking into real estate, actually doing some research can take you a long way. shit can just be as simple as people saving they money instead of purchasing cosmetic things
2442 2019-04-17 00:03:32 It will be very interesting to see $INTC stocks performance over the year or two with AMD dominating X86 and Qualcomm taking out their 5G chip business. @KyleBennett  has his work cut out for him with his new gig.
2443 2019-04-17 00:02:55 $ABT reports early tomorrow. The consensus calls for adjusted profit of 62 cents per share on $7.48 billion in sales. #stocks #investing #pharma
2444 2019-04-17 00:02:54 Dans les memories, tu cliques longtemps sur une photo et cliques sur my eyes only, c'est genre une gallerie photo et y'a un code pour y accéder généralement les gens stocks des nudes ou quoi. Moi y'a des selfies de moi
