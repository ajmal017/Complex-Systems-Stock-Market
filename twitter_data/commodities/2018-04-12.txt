Koons, a former Wall Street commodities broker, reportedly ran up legal bills of almost $4 million trying to get the boy - who he once described as a "biological sculpture" - back to America.

45 2018-04-12 20:59:39 Understood. The fact that someone so failure prone is viewed as "powerful" is just this topsy turvey world but that is how it is with an entitlement god complex where people are commodities and not human beings to these creeps.
46 2018-04-12 20:56:57 Non-hedge funds (public funds) are extremely limited in what they can do.  Traditionally they could only buy and hold stocks and bonds.  No derivatives, currencies, commodities, real estate, etc.  that’s evolved, blurring the lines a little.

53 2018-04-12 19:54:47 I'm not surprised.  The players are commodities and the teams treat them as such.  And like Grayson said, the texans are making it really hard to be a fan.  All this bs about getting the right kind of player, but yet they don't seem to be the right kind of FO.  Fucking brutal.
54 2018-04-12 19:47:13 were talking about commodities that you cant physically pick up, like filming and editing
55 2018-04-12 19:40:57 The more things/roles in healthcare are not 'a path to wealth' and are commodities instead better it would be for patients. My anecdata is that too many in the health care delivery path in the US are still able to capture more value compared to elsewhere in the world.

73 2018-04-12 18:44:48 yeah but the workers create commodities regardless of public funding or  not, the point that state research funding helped the iphone is irrelevant to this meme. The capitalist state is not an extension of workers, I don't know how I was supposed to draw that from your point.

77 2018-04-12 18:21:39 On what basis? And was this his song two years ago. No one cares about workers unless they are in their shoes. The price of basic commodities has risen in addition to meeting other needs. But who cares right?
78 2018-04-12 18:15:14 Agree, however do commodities still create value? (Don't think on oil solely) If so, is this showing us intangible global value chains?
79 2018-04-12 18:14:15 Worth noting about half the oil pricing team in London at @PlattsOil is women, with collective background in economics, journalism, IR, political economy, finance, geology and commodities trading. And it's amazing the difference spending your days around these women makes.

91 2018-04-12 17:12:30 I hope there is some close scrutiny about  $LFIN's  "Sale of physical commodities," which was responsible for almost 90% of their revenue. "Revenue primarily consists of $66.6 million related to the sale of physical commodities for sale to our customers."
92 2018-04-12 17:09:49 with all due respect sir, when information like this begins to reflect on the cost of commodities in the common market for the common man like me..we will begin to take this sort of thing seriously. Nigeria is a country where even those compiling the stats could have been bought!
93 2018-04-12 17:05:57 Facebook is a great marketing tool when strategy meets outstanding commodities. Referrals from people who've viewed the LISO video we shot last month are massive. We're overwhelmed and we appreciate the love. This is only the beginning.
94 2018-04-12 17:02:20 People often express amazement that someone "like me" (ie, not a "typical" biz reporter) would find economics interesting and enjoy writing about it. But economics, and esp commodities, have affected me my whole life: especially because I grew up in Calgary.

112 2018-04-12 15:49:14 Your argument would be sound if everyone made identical products and price was the only differential i.e. commodities. But that is not the nature of most markets if it was the only criteria we would all drive the cheapest car. We don't.
113 2018-04-12 15:45:17 Excellent article. In addition to the elements described by the writer, the US is facing the challenge of a rapidly increasing debt coupled with the dedollarisation of many commodities (oil, etc.).

118 2018-04-12 15:25:17 This question has haunted me. Why ask for a quarterly filing? Three suspicions: 1) They want to see cap table changes. 2) Their 1-SA booked commodities revenue on a net basis (as of June 2017), but the EOY 10-K booked on a gross basis. Why? What does Q3 look like standalone....

124 2018-04-12 15:12:27 IMO, in the Outl*nder fandom, like Facebo*k, fans aren’t the consumers. They’re the product. Their money, time and unquestioning dedication are commodities sought to further market share, ratings, careers, and charity receipts. As a result, they ultimately have very little power.

224 2018-04-12 05:18:07 Dumb Bhakts won’t understand that petrol impacts prices of all commodities like food etc. Of course Bhakts don’t eat food. They eat @narendramodi cr.ap bhashaans, which is free for them.

227 2018-04-12 04:55:44 A price increase will actually help Russia. But basically during a large war, the price of everything goes up. Steel, fuel and most other commodities are needed for the war effort, decreasing the supply & increasing the demand.
228 2018-04-12 04:53:04 I think an underappreciated fact about Indian development is that, while it has lots of coal, in most other commodities its mineral resources are quite poor. 

That means its choices will more closely resemble those of Japan or Korea than those of the U.S. or China.

230 2018-04-12 04:47:48 The phone book was local - FB has a major long term issue, the youth 25 and under do not use it- they use Instagram maybe whats app - they are not long differentiators - commodities - they would be lucky to be in the S&P 500 in 2028
231 2018-04-12 04:36:03 “Blow it” is pretty aggressive. I think it’s odd not to have signed him especially since it wasn’t a huge deal. But ultimately there are others options and they don’t always have to be proven commodities.
232 2018-04-12 04:27:19 Y do these government employees like ticket counter officials,TT's,bus conductor etc treat common people like shit.
 Like excuse me sir/madam  I m paying my money and  travelling or using the commodities. 
Public property doesn't not belong to u so stop acting like that.#india

234 2018-04-12 04:11:54 Agriculture cannot keep up with middle class and upper class economics as the land cannot increase its economic output. Only a higher price of agri commodities can lead to higher economic output, which cant be done, because prices of agri in other countries cannot be controlled.
235 2018-04-12 03:52:47 That is crazy! US housing market isn’t exactly correlated to commodities.
236 2018-04-12 03:48:37 @semnasdag2018 Our farmers need more supervisor to produce commodities with very good quality to compete in global market. Local campaign.

Toda vez que tiver com as necessidades baixas, é só digitar que ele aumenta todas elas.

238 2018-04-12 03:43:14 Great, just great to have it laid out like this. Totally agree. Although not exact, would have to say that tech stocks are nearish a top, and commodities are on the lowish side. Still important to time entries.

240 2018-04-12 03:31:46 production for human need, not make commodities for exchange value, is a sine qua non for there being more than 0.1% of the earths current population in 100 years
241 2018-04-12 03:30:48 ill stop bothering you but if u really think there is no planet b and are interested in saving this one, u gotta think more radically anticapitalist. because there is no way an economy based on the production of commodities for profit can save the planet. hasnt yet, wont ever

243 2018-04-12 03:25:50 I know you want commodities to market. But are you sure the tough guy way is the right way?
244 2018-04-12 03:16:50 Yep yep yep I'm way more comfortable with those "what is the dollar value of your body's component chemicals if broken down and sold as industrial commodities?" analyses than I am with USER ENGAGEMENT STATS

247 2018-04-12 03:01:25 Why is it men with the loudest opinions on the appearance of women are rarely hot commodities themselves? Was "hypocrisy" missing from their dictionaries?
248 2018-04-12 02:44:34 To me this headline should be oil negative. All commodities are red except oil and products. Must be war jitters still.
249 2018-04-12 02:43:34 To me it is a breakdown of the empathy, which is a defense mechanism we all have, and use from time to time. We usually come out of it and start feeling again eventually, mgtow seem to have built an approach to life that has broken us down to purely commodities.

251 2018-04-12 02:25:24 Surveys can be manipulated. Go to any market place and ask 100 people whether they are happy with the high price of rice and basic commodities.
252 2018-04-12 02:24:49 Why is  Modi fasting:-
- for not being able to credit Rs 15 lakhs in each bank account. 
- for not being able to create 1 crore jobs per year and every year. 
- for not being able to reduce prices of essential commodities. 
- for successfully massacring Dalits

255 2018-04-12 01:50:12 What the hell do you mean!? Investment has nothing to do with anything as gushy as "a business friendly environment." What the hell is that, anyhow? How is it charted?
Commodities prices are real, and they track foreign direct investment in this instance.
256 2018-04-12 01:48:05 Remember the pay phones in the hallways off hill committee rooms? Those puppies were serious commodities back in the day.

you and kajoq are actually the hottest commodities. :)
260 2018-04-12 00:48:36 Haha..frank mentioned that he traded commodities for 25 years.  He was probably referring to his monthly stipend of food stamps that he traded in for beef jerky.

264 2018-04-12 00:23:06 Nice play on words Sumona. And I'm in favor of anything that is more focused on our presence and humanity, and less focused on us as commodities.
265 2018-04-12 00:20:24 Some great points.  Energy and commodities seem like a compelling trade here with oil >$65 and climbing.  Commodity related issues probably catch a significant bid.  But it could be just a temporary side show to the real US tech growth story.
266 2018-04-12 00:14:57 Thank you. The elderly are valuable commodities.
267 2018-04-12 00:11:53 And in capitalism the capitalists win.  Workers are just another commodity.  Marx's real insight is that workers are people not commodities for the capitalist.
