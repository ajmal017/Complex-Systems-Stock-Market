0 2018-11-01 23:59:27 Finally made my first purchase in stocks 
1 2018-11-01 23:59:10 KC gave up penny stocks for that move. (how it seems when the move works)
2 2018-11-01 23:58:44 European stocks ended mixed on Thursday after a slew of results of varying quality. UK telco @bt_uk spiked 8.6% and Dutch bank ING soared 5.7% as their earnings surprised, while @CreditSuisse dropped 2.1% and @Shell sank 3% as their results disappointed
3 2018-11-01 23:58:11 Love your handle,  these stocks are (mostly) all overvalued.  In my humble opinion
4 2018-11-01 23:58:04 oh I don't doubt it. I'm just assuming you think Trump is the reason your stocks are doing better now than they were in 2010-2016, but literally every chart you can find shows that's not the case.
5 2018-11-01 23:58:03 20% is usually enough, with no more than 20 stocks actually invested. This is best to allow for unpleasant surprises & close monitoring of progress. Problem with this though is that you are then encouraged to top slice early when winners should be run longer.. a difficult balance
6 2018-11-01 23:57:34 My stocks are recovering :)
7 2018-11-01 23:56:48 I know a store that stocks LRG stuff in Seattle, maybe I'll check when I'm there in a couple weeks!

10 2018-11-01 23:55:22 some golden knights tickets or... pot stocks. i am really torn . #TMobileONE
11 2018-11-01 23:55:21 US stocks rose on Thursday, buoyed by positive comments from president Donald Trump on the progress in trade talks with China.

16 2018-11-01 23:46:07 Many stocks to add to my “short” candidates list today
17 2018-11-01 23:44:09 Want a perfect portfolio of stocks to hold forever?  J&J, McDonald's, Exxon Mobil, Verizon, Proctor and Gamble. Keep buying them on dips through the issuing company itself, and hold until your retirement. It's as close to fool proof as you can get.

36 2018-11-01 23:43:10 I keep asking.. who is the economy doing better for? Besides the super rich and their tax cut (my paycheck barely changed...same most I know). Health care costs more. The stock market was doing well but again, middle and lower class not buying stocks. & they want Social security
37 2018-11-01 23:42:55 Netflix is already suffering and they think this will keep their proverbial ship afloat? All I can say is y'all better sell your netflix stocks now.
38 2018-11-01 23:41:44 Mother of all rallies! Stocks will get a huge bounce
39 2018-11-01 23:41:14 Don't forget, on October 1, the anniversary of Las Vegas massacre, he promised bump stocks would be banned "in a couple weeks."
40 2018-11-01 23:40:12 It's effing awesome to hear a Republican bragging that he was the first governor to ban bump stocks after the Nevada gun massacre.
41 2018-11-01 23:39:44 Shipping stocks generally do great during this time of the year, I wouldn't hold on to them after November though. GG.
42 2018-11-01 23:37:37 @cryptomarkets2 hey bro, was playing tech stocks today and not paying attn to oil. What’s the skinny in the drop? Just technicals or some type of news?
43 2018-11-01 23:37:12 Silver and Gold going down, but their MINING STOCKS are going up...
THIS MEANS A PREDICTED REPUBLICAN TSUNAMI !!!!!!!!!!!
44 2018-11-01 23:37:06 US stocks disconnected from international @intrepidcapital
45 2018-11-01 23:35:40 Ok, but then bring back the Stocks, I say.
46 2018-11-01 23:33:38 They say that no one rings a bell at the top. Well this drivel Elon is pumping out is as insane, fantastic and delusional as I think I have ever heard or seen. I keep away from cult stocks but I think it’s high time to lose some premium on this puppy.
47 2018-11-01 23:33:34 That was too old for these fast moving stocks! Lol I was going to grab .062 a while back but was just way too slow.
48 2018-11-01 23:32:20 The "smart phones are a commodity" and "Apples best days are behind them" stories have been repeated over and over again ad nauseum for around a decade now. Stocks gone from split adjusted $10 to $220 in that time frame.
49 2018-11-01 23:31:23 Put them in the stocks and let people throw eggs, flour, rotten tomatoes etc and spit on them, that’s what they deserve so that they fully understand the utter humiliation that their victim felt.
50 2018-11-01 23:31:22 YouTube was wouldn’t monetize his videos so he stopped and invested his YouTube money into stocks and shit. Keemstar put up an interviewer with him and it was pretty good imo.
51 2018-11-01 23:30:29 2 technology stocks soared strong  on Thursday:
$NXPI 12.1%, $AMD 11.0%
52 2018-11-01 23:28:53 Except Paddock was known to be a supporter of Trump, happy with how the stock market was doing, and a known supporter of bump stocks. Try again.
53 2018-11-01 23:28:41 6 months ago is about when UEC started their bullshit widespread.  Expect the next 2 months to be tough for UEC since they have to deal with their debt.  Also, smart guy explain the 17 mil share short position vs related stocks?  I think the market agrees with me.
54 2018-11-01 23:27:37 I would buy stocks  I’m trying to build over here #TMobileONE
55 2018-11-01 23:27:14 How much stocks do you own in the private prison industry?
56 2018-11-01 23:27:09 Gina has stood up for better, safer gun laws and safer schools:

 Banned concealed carry firearms in schools
 1st governor to sign Red Flag EO after Parkland
 Signed Red Flag Law
 Banned bump stocks
 Took guns away from abusers
57 2018-11-01 23:25:19 I'm out of crypto and back into stocks for the meantime but eca is the only thing I have left, been here since 60sats
58 2018-11-01 23:25:17 Am watching this one but I have been a little slow to get any. I'm getting too hold for these fast moving stocks! Lol
59 2018-11-01 23:23:17 Whoever these morons were confusing birds and planes should be thrown into the stocks.
60 2018-11-01 23:22:37 ...think they deserve to have their lack of understanding lead to early bankroll hits.  And that’s not even bringing up how free cappers use their mirage of success to go tout, to push other touts, to pump-and-dump stocks, to start podcasts, etc
61 2018-11-01 23:22:06 Sorry if we cannot provide an ETA, Rahul. We suggest that you select "Notify Me" instead on the order page so that you will receive an email once stocks are back. Your patience is appreciated.
62 2018-11-01 23:21:50 bon en gros le online t'auras une chance sur 2 de te taper quelqu'un qui met genre les stocks mais n'importe quel stage ou soit quelqu'un qui met les stages en version bf/fd mais qui met le timer génial mdr
au moins elite smash ça viendra un peu sauver le tout
enfin j'éspère
63 2018-11-01 23:21:27 Stocks: You should get a timeshare up there...
64 2018-11-01 23:20:10 Ugh, IEA lady! Spending is backed up by bonds, which are backed up by investors, which is good for savers and investors and help stocks to build economic growth. You’re from and institution with ‘economic’ in its name #bbcqt
65 2018-11-01 23:20:02 That’s great but if your going to vote a DEM ticket Tuesday, sell your stocks before you vote!
66 2018-11-01 23:18:27 Several mentioned on FBN today that they were either selling stocks, projecting loss coming days for FB!
67 2018-11-01 23:18:22 Maybe if they allowed stake nets they’d also allow the control of seals. Like back in the day when there were loads more salmon but the seals, cormorants, mergansers, goosanders were all controlled to a level where salmon stocks were healthy.
68 2018-11-01 23:18:14 If it makes you feel better I made a whole $0.91 on stocks today 
69 2018-11-01 23:16:00 Sorry for my bluntness earlier. But EPS up 41% YoY, Revenues up 20%, and other cies don't report unit sales. So, IMO, Cook is a very good CEO. But tech stocks are going to crash, it's a sign.
70 2018-11-01 23:15:32 Entirely possible dip will be bought tmrw. Even if it sustains, not worried about AAPL long term. There's a lot going on to push markets lower but of FAANG stocks, AAPL has been most resilient to recent downturn. Trump pushing China resolution talks into midterms will help too.
71 2018-11-01 23:15:15 Let put in like 5 dollars into these stocks,
72 2018-11-01 23:15:15 Coins are a worse gamble than otc stocks, I wouldn’t put my name anywhere near that shit.
73 2018-11-01 23:12:52 Aussie market off to a softer start for the first time in 6 sessions. #ASX 200 is down 0.35% or 20pts to 5820 on the open Friday. Losses from the banks, consumer staples & energy stocks offsetting gains from miners #ausbiz
74 2018-11-01 23:12:28 Middle class? Your deductions have been taken away so you'll be paying MORE taxes. Your healthcare premiums going up thanks to ACA stripped. Pre-existing? Your healthcare will drop you. Gas up 30%, rents up, food prices up, stocks plunging, tariffs costs passed on to U! #VoteDem
75 2018-11-01 23:12:08 This is an excellent reason to bring back the stocks if there ever was one.
76 2018-11-01 23:10:43 Number of leading stocks today: 15 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
77 2018-11-01 23:10:29 do direct TV now and stream it over the Internet
78 2018-11-01 23:09:42 for the people that wonders what im doing now. im startet to learn to trade stocks. and actually im not too bad. and i got school :) overall motivated for my future and still thinking of streaming when im done with school just saying <3
79 2018-11-01 23:09:34 At over 55, not an option for me. I'd be uninsurable until Medicare. I never meet my 10 grand deductible but forced to buy insurance for 10 more years. Obamacare was ALWAYS payola to insurance industry. Check their stocks thru it.
80 2018-11-01 23:09:11 I'd stump up a tenner for a ringside seat. Could we bring stocks back in the market place...?
81 2018-11-01 23:07:43 Sounds silly, but stocks are too confusing to me, crypto is much simpler 
82 2018-11-01 23:07:14 In your view, apart from REITs is there an alternative asset sub-class that has a relatively low correlation to both stocks and bonds AND provides decent returns AND is easily and directly accessible for individual investors?
83 2018-11-01 23:06:15 Pity we don't have the stocks.These kids need to feel humiliation
84 2018-11-01 23:06:07 #Realtradershavelosses
Up 20 percent. Shifted to brasil and turkish stocks. All turkish stocks are at pe of 1. Many have huge cash.
85 2018-11-01 23:05:45 I post one picture on snap with the nismo stocks off the car and everyone blows my shit up. I'm never selling them shits
86 2018-11-01 23:05:13 The beauty is that if it pisses off the Hollywood elites, which I'm sure you're not,  then @POTUS is doing everything right.  Bet you're not complaining about your stocks are you?  Booming economy,  low unemployment and respect worldwide.  NICE
87 2018-11-01 23:04:59 you asked for Trump accomplishments. i gave you an extensive partial list that you only skimmed, cuz you were never interested and only wanted to troll. it's folks like you who are ruining the Democratic party and making us laughing stocks. good day to you
88 2018-11-01 23:04:01 If the church wants to start pay taxes and own up to being a GIANT multinational corporation with billions in real estate and stocks then they can say whatever they damn well please. You agree, @CorporateJesus ?

90 2018-11-01 23:02:52 If you wanna trade individual stocks, do it with defined risk.
91 2018-11-01 23:02:27 Trading stocks is like having employees. Hiring them is easy, and managing them is a bitch, but the key to survival is firing the bad ones before they drag your business down and rob you blind.
92 2018-11-01 23:02:25 Today, stocks cra…. This two-minute clip of nathan for you today.
93 2018-11-01 23:02:14 Jim, just forget about UEC. There are many fantastic plays in the U space. UEC is not cheap (MC/lbs).maybe they hit $3 after 232, but that's about it. You're still lucky . many U stocks are a bargain.the cost of opportunity is to high. important is making $, not UEC management

95 2018-11-01 23:02:08 I’m in the U.K. my long term stocks, post-brexit, are tinned fruits and vegetables, and a hunting knife.
96 2018-11-01 23:01:48 I’d suggest stick to ETF’s like $SPY, $IWM, $TLT, $FXE, $GLD, $XLE. Much less outlier moves than in individual stocks.
97 2018-11-01 23:01:06 This is one of my fav Ted talks.. Inspiring . The line where he goes like he accidentally picked the financial section instead of the  sports sec. and his cell mate goes like "you pick stocks "? And he goes like what is stocks ? ....
98 2018-11-01 23:00:14 I cancelled NetFlix months ago and get all giddy watching their stocks plummet!
99 2018-11-01 22:59:07 Put the fucker in the stocks
100 2018-11-01 22:59:06 Ah, I misread “stocks under accumulation “ as stocks under accumulation by our group.
101 2018-11-01 22:57:44 Omgosh!  I wasn’t asking financial advise. Sorry to mislead you. I was asking about what stocks to look at that would be of concern or detrimental or hurt USA.  Good word lend.
102 2018-11-01 22:55:42 My closing "green" stocks:  ICNAF .71 +8%...GGTTF .66 +7.9%...MDTR .013 +6%...AMFE .08 9+5%...AMCN .37 +5%...CIIX .635 +4%...SODE .08 +3.9%...TGIFF .325 +2.5%...LWLG $1.00 +1%...EHVVF .02 +.3% my green stocks today...all MJ's except AMCN and LWLG. Have a good one all.
103 2018-11-01 22:55:35 After a bad month for stocks, there is some positive news: consumer confidence has climbed to an 18 year high, which was influenced by the high levels of economic growth the U.S. has been experiencing. #SUACCF18
104 2018-11-01 22:54:38 We must do this. 20 stocks that make up the ETF #MAGA.  I’ll go first $HLF. Herbalife owned in part by @Carl_C_Icahn and advocate to The president. The rules are simple, you can only name one company per tweet.
105 2018-11-01 22:54:12 Scenario of co-operation...
Trump starts trade wars, gives Powell ammo to Normalise Rates via inflation. This also normalises stocks down from stupid highs. Pause... Trade deal done and everybody happy  #InItTogether
106 2018-11-01 22:53:52 US stocks have risen for a third straight session as President Donald Trump said trade talks with China were "moving along nicely," reviving hopes that the two countries can resolve their trade dispute
107 2018-11-01 22:52:25 $RAC showed yesterday that the bio frenzy isn't limited to stocks under 5c... $RHY should be one to watch given its already had the initial flush above & has an excellent story to sell.
108 2018-11-01 22:51:46 Your clueless about economics, if we buy all cheap goods from China we continue to lose businesses and jobs that lower skilled Americans need. Notice we export nothing to China but but everything from them. Look at the shitty stuff Walmart stocks their shelves with.
109 2018-11-01 22:51:13 Do you know why they are that rich? They buy stocks (ie. Warren Buffet) but he never sells them. He would be taxed if he sold but chooses not too. Also the tax on Cap Gains /Dividends are at 15% or 20% based on your income. You and all fellow investors fall into that category.
110 2018-11-01 22:49:47 Does anyone remember when the Wilshire 5000 had 5000 stocks in it?
111 2018-11-01 22:49:21 LOL...I do...and thanks to this potus my stocks are not doing well recently....I guess it's a good thing I switched to Geico.
112 2018-11-01 22:48:52 Weed is so high #stocks
113 2018-11-01 22:48:48 Well done 
114 2018-11-01 22:48:11 I wouldn’t mind stocks going down, way, way, down so that I can buy at a price I don’t assume to be over inflated.
115 2018-11-01 22:47:52 @I_AM_WILDCAT what books did you read to learn about stocks
116 2018-11-01 22:47:49 normal, les armes en plastique ont été livrées à l'Arabie, selon Parly. Il faut bien écouler les stocks de vraies. mais rassurez-vous elle ne serviront pas à tuer, c'est juste de la déco, c'est toujours elle qui le dit
117 2018-11-01 22:45:58 Way too complicated. So many cheap stocks given recent sell off. Why futz with GE?
118 2018-11-01 22:44:54 Stocks!
119 2018-11-01 22:43:08 Oh you said stocks
120 2018-11-01 22:42:55 Received a package for my O'Shares. Always a mad booklet. Kevin pays me abour $1 for my FANG stocks.
121 2018-11-01 22:42:25 How is he protecting Americans when violence and caos is at highest levels of all time. And now everyone is afraid. Everything costs more now stocks are on yearly low and unstable
122 2018-11-01 22:41:48 I think if you look more closely, the difference between left and right on this matter is that the right wing got in first to name these issues. "Fish stocks" is a very loaded term if you *don't* believe fish populations are there to be exploited.
123 2018-11-01 22:41:43 What was your population we up ours 10k for corn stocks
124 2018-11-01 22:41:23 I think I'm going to have had multiple bump stocks located in his hotel room.
125 2018-11-01 22:40:48 Awful! Millennials "Rapped" About My Blue Chip Stocks !!?!
126 2018-11-01 22:40:23 Stocks are overvalued. I buy undervalued asset classes.
127 2018-11-01 22:39:59 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
128 2018-11-01 22:39:30 Thanks for the encouraging words, sport!  And thanks for playing the Mannkind game - maybe one of these decades your years of pumping will pay off!  When I grow up, I want to be paid to analyze penny and micro cap stocks like you!
129 2018-11-01 22:38:17 25. Full time job and full time college student. I also trade stocks and lost 35 lbs this year. We are out there broski. Keep hustling
130 2018-11-01 22:37:51 Surely aprat from that it id also if you are the Left leaning Government don’t screw up. Sometimes we need to take stocks.
131 2018-11-01 22:37:42 Only long-term stocks I really consider are high-div yield stocks (eg. utilities & energy)
132 2018-11-01 22:37:42 Is everyone scared of stocks all of a sudden?
133 2018-11-01 22:37:22 Forecasting the race for the House Updated Nov. 1, 2018, at 5:42 P.M. "5 in 6 Chance Democrats win control (84.4%)." 1 in 6 Chance Republicans keep control(15.6%). Source "FiveThirtyEight." #Stocks #Election #Vote #Politics
134 2018-11-01 22:36:34 I hope so Mo I know it’s been a tough period for many 

I get just as much pleasure seeing others beating the market than I do myself 

November and December are typically strong months and with many stocks running along the bottom channels there’s plenty of scope for growth 
135 2018-11-01 22:35:28 Thank you sir x
136 2018-11-01 22:35:28 82 percent of all US stocks are held by the wealthiest 10 percent.  Meaning that 90 percent of the country has an 18 percent share of the market, making them  minority shareholders in the entire stock market.
137 2018-11-01 22:32:41 GM is buying tesla stocks
138 2018-11-01 22:32:03 No for sure. I'd get owned in an ironman. I'd need to take like 10 stocks with Cloud to stand a chance
139 2018-11-01 22:31:49 Nah. If stocks drop a lot it is because there is the smell of a consumer led recession. Even the most optimistic realise that people hold off buying  luxury EVs in a consumer led recession.
Especially when most teslas sell to dotcom employees who feel rich from tech stock.
140 2018-11-01 22:31:37 Some truth to this, but requires a considerable faith in another sector (like oil), that has been decimated by recent growth stock appreciation...bonds. I agree that QT offers a compelling argument for just such a rotation, but recent buying in growth stocks suggests otherwise.
141 2018-11-01 22:31:28 Or stocks that rallied on expecting a rally from strong AAPL earnings forget why they rallied. Response of futures to AAPL earnings is muted. Stocks see lack of response as strength and rally again. Hopefully, it's just big guys propping up futures right now for the morning dump.
142 2018-11-01 22:30:46 What exactly does it matter? What is Trump's net worth? What has Sanders' personal wealth got anything to do with healthcare, education, minimum wage, workers' rights, etc? Wealth he didn't steal on stocks & scams like most Republicans/the right, rather earned in public service.
143 2018-11-01 22:30:06 They both deserve to be in the stocks- a pair of shysters
144 2018-11-01 22:29:48 Probably not. 

On the other hand the stocks are going down for a reason. Their revenue and sales are declining. 

Tesla's are not. People pay a premium for growth when it is rare.
145 2018-11-01 22:29:36 Hard to short when the market goes straight up was planning on buying puts in $AAPL and $SMH stocks into the close. That squeeze was crazy $4 run up in 1 hour in Apple. The market is all machines past couple weeks.
146 2018-11-01 22:27:55 That the average joe should tolerate uncomfortable risk by owning a basket of stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies etc just to beat inflation and grow their wealth is the sympton of a broken capitalist system built on the back of unsound money.
147 2018-11-01 22:27:44 A remember listening to him earlier in the year and i think he mentioned ianthus and liberty health and stocks he was looking at. I’ll try and find that podcast episode. Wonder, is he still hype after the merger? Hope so lol
148 2018-11-01 22:27:23 What the hell? Stocks went up under a Democrat.

150 2018-11-01 22:24:24 It just seems very convenient that the stock market is not dropping the last couple of days, makes me wonder if trumps people are buying stocks to pump the market up before election day.
151 2018-11-01 22:24:06 My whole profit share going into stocks. 
152 2018-11-01 22:23:56 Absolutely brilliant. Well done to you all. Thoroughly deserved.

159 2018-11-01 22:22:03 Ehh, @jimcramer just said economic deterioration is good because it will slow the Fed and it makes stocks rally.

The sound effects sold me on his being in the know.

162 2018-11-01 22:19:54 Apple stocks falling from the trees in after hours trading after the company announced slowing sales, missed iPhone shipment estimates, and lower expected future revenues. The big iPhone price tag may have lost Apple their $trillion market value
163 2018-11-01 22:19:17 Risks holds through the US session. The #USD tumbled, failing to hold its fightback to the Yen. #Dow posted its thrird straight tripple figure session closing 264 higher. #Oil fell further losing 139 cents, trading at 7-month lows hitting $63.14

165 2018-11-01 22:17:58 Are these stocks ?
166 2018-11-01 22:16:33 but I am in Wilmington next week and only want to know if it stocks Boscia Black Cleanser. Then I can come into the store.
167 2018-11-01 22:16:08 imagine being one of the very first people to buy apple stocks 
168 2018-11-01 22:15:40 @fausto412 $TREE Nice but I'm not feeling today like I missed out on anything. We had a record number of breakout stocks today $PI $LABU etc
169 2018-11-01 22:15:01 Thanks, Miles! I view the foreign-born percentage of Japan's total population to be a metric similar to solar power's overall % of total installed electricity generation capacity. Flows, not stocks, are the proper measure of recent trends IMO.
170 2018-11-01 22:14:31 Funny how Google, AMZN and Apple gave poor guidance for Q4. In this economy heading into Xmas season.? Sounds like a ploy to drive stocks down ahead of mid-terms.
171 2018-11-01 22:14:09 More on investing. $tcehy $baba $npsny $yy soared 5-10% today. Mainly based on 1 tweet, which is not sensible (what Trump tweets 1 day he reverses the next). Sure the stocks are very low so buying for the long term makes sense. I doubt the Nov meeting w/ both leaders resolves it.
172 2018-11-01 22:14:02 Stacking penny stocks
173 2018-11-01 22:13:32 It doesn’t take a rocket scientist; remember election night and the day after how Dow Jones soared!!! Stocks went up!
174 2018-11-01 22:12:51 Market Close: MBS +9bps; DOW +264.98; NASDAQ +128.16; S&P 500 +28.73; 10yr Treasury 3.13%;  stocks close in positive territory, while Yields cooled a bit, which helped MBS rebound from negative territory.
175 2018-11-01 22:11:36 Stocks go up, down, sideways. Traders trade them, because they use price and not their pride. I have no problem with $AAPL going down, but when someone makes outrageous calls because they are a shitty trader and missed the boat back in April, that's on them! 170, you crack me up!
176 2018-11-01 22:11:35 Who can teach me about stocks ? Selling and buying 
177 2018-11-01 22:11:04 I see Wall Street is trying to protect #trump by artificially inflating the 30 stocks that make up the reported numbers -- i have news for you -- watch out!!!

179 2018-11-01 22:10:49 Companies that are huge and generate cash and are truely profitable. Real estate is a no. Bonds a no (except wee inflation treasuries). Growth stocks no. Gold/silver and gold stocks a little as a hedge. Just beat inflation as safe and nimble as you can. This is only my opinion.

194 2018-11-01 21:59:52 Just enough to entice you in. Stick with stocks.
195 2018-11-01 21:59:10 Oh, I think it does (I'm not Dem, so ...). People being able to buy whatever they want without being checked if criminal/violent isn't a great idea. Some limitation on carnage-ready weaponry could be great (bump stocks, large mags, ...).
196 2018-11-01 21:58:58 If you got sum money put up go INVEST into STOCKS
197 2018-11-01 21:58:58 If $AAPL is going to fall tomorrow hopefully the smart money focuses on buying the other cheap stocks like $AMZN $NFLX $NVDA $GOOGL $FB $TSLA

203 2018-11-01 21:56:48 I don't care about the current misinterpretion of the 2nd. There are already limits to gun ownership - just make them more sensible (background check, no large mags, bumps stocks, ...).
I own guns, but I don't want random idiots to be able to massacre at random as they are today.
204 2018-11-01 21:56:39 in the Army,not once did I ever hear the word ASSAULT WEAPON,till politicians made it up.Most  owners keep there guns locked.Bump stocks,melt Ar15s in 1 minute,hence why the Vegas shooter had 15,most broke and melted,takes 1 second to change a mag 10/20/30=same 1 second
205 2018-11-01 21:55:53 I'm betting that we'll be able to buy spec stocks cheaper in the am from what I see about the two I've posted about as long as... 1/
206 2018-11-01 21:55:37 Adam,
Owning drug stocks is very negative to your psyche.
Everyday, subconsciously, you are hoping for more sickness/pain to drive up the sales at your company.

For this reason, I do not own pharma 
... just my personal feeling

208 2018-11-01 21:55:05 The fact that my congressman has so many stocks that he feels put upon to divest them just to serve his country is everything you need to know about him. @RepTomMacArthur does not represent his constituents, he is on this for the $$.
#AndyKimForCongress
209 2018-11-01 21:54:58 As prices of daily household needs are skyrocketing with not even a few dollars left to save which was possible two years ago! Why? Because only the millionaires & billionaires are lucky to get their tax cuts & play or gamble with their stocks & bonds, right???
210 2018-11-01 21:54:19 I checked the stocks app but I guess it’s not fully up to date yet.

216 2018-11-01 21:51:46 Do you have evidence that he intended to write about Overstock and then didn’t do so?  Is it unusual for financial journalists to invest in individual stocks?
217 2018-11-01 21:51:22 Liz - how about a graph comparing inflation in the economy to sectors like groceries and autos, with health care and education. One monolithic solution is inherently inferior to 40+ health companies competing in the marketplace.Would U invest in stocks if Gov set the prices?
218 2018-11-01 21:50:54 Demographics show that population is aging with the next four years having the peak of the baby boomers retiring so sales of Apple products will only get lower. How can reporting this be good for pumping up their stocks? Might even have the opposite effect God forbid.
219 2018-11-01 21:50:30 “Yea here you go landlord, sorry I don’t have actual fucking money for rent, but here are some *squints* stocks that are like worth something I heard”
220 2018-11-01 21:50:21 Signs the economy is going to tank in the next 6 months due to Trump policies you say? How about my stocks losing 90% of their growth in 1 month.
221 2018-11-01 21:50:06 Today my old startup has been acquired by another co. for all cash deal. I am eligible for 1000 stocks ESOPs given. Will get a decent payout! Seriously looking to invest in a town home, near to work. Have seen some. Keep looking! Credit History there since Sept 2015. :-)
222 2018-11-01 21:49:17 Considering the EIA was constructive, not sure I'd point to it as a catalyst. Might be a combo of sell the news on sanctions, and recent weak M-PMI data from GB, CN and US. Paradoxically, growth stocks dismissed the data, & embraced aggressive forward growth valuations...SMH.
223 2018-11-01 21:47:15 Like Uber, but an app that trades stocks based on whether or not the company reaches out to offer a post-earnings interview with their CEO
224 2018-11-01 21:47:13 US stocks rose for a 3rd straight session as President Trump said trade talks with China were "moving along nicely," reviving hopes that the 2 countries can resolve their trade dispute. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are 5 points higher at 5,813. #ausshares #stockmarket
225 2018-11-01 21:46:56 lmao same, I wasnt around but ive seen the older people say everyone switched to stocks or forex and by the time everyone switched over crypto was back lol

231 2018-11-01 21:44:47 @jimcramer Question, I am somewhat new to picking individual stocks. Starbucks had 2 or 3% same store growth. In recent quarters if they did not reach 5% the stock would get slammed. Why has this changed recently.
232 2018-11-01 21:44:36 @AskRobinhood when do transfer usually come in? I need some cash to buy these cheap Apple stocks hopefully before pre-market!
233 2018-11-01 21:44:14 No hay evidencia al menos. Los stocks de pf son históricamente bastante inelasticos a la tasa. Puede q haya influido la tasa de leliq en las posiciones de spot y futuro de los bancos, descomprimiendo el spot. Pero todavía no tengo números para verlo
234 2018-11-01 21:43:59 Yeah, then proceed to dump after they report absolutely stunning numbers like the rest of FANG stocks... So i can scoop some cheaper calls once we hit channel support. Thanks dawg
235 2018-11-01 21:41:36 Bro I feel you. Pin pointed market reversal points this morning on like 3-4 stocks ... got in 2 and couldn’t stay in them. One went up 400% while hitting my initial that,and I made like 50% bc I got out early. Green is green I know but leaving as so much on the table hurts too.
236 2018-11-01 21:40:33 Excuse me but I know what my funds are doing.  Maybe I am just good at picking stocks and managing my 357 and 401k .but they are doing great.
237 2018-11-01 21:40:17 My problem with staying long stocks after pop ....Lots of gaps just below most stocks ....And depending on trump to do the right thing on trade ,Terrifying. Went all cash at close ...Im confused ha
238 2018-11-01 21:38:49 I think I all companies should stop reporting earnings and let investor buy stocks based on what they see
239 2018-11-01 21:38:47 what s your view Kevin? we were oversold on lots of indicators like oscillators, 3m new H/L...not sure yet if we had a Follow Through...little stocks with nice bases but seems the mket could be advanced in the bottoming phase?
240 2018-11-01 21:38:42 OK NOW WE DIPPING BABY $AAPL calls sold and long term puts should be good to go.  If Job #'s bad all stocks reverse to Tuesday lows?  Curious what you think?
241 2018-11-01 21:38:27 All stocks now down because of apple ! :(
242 2018-11-01 21:38:19 Dipshit... the reason that the stock market has fallen perfectly parallels with the prediction that Democrats take the house.  The more certain the democrat victory the further down the stocks and business sentiment falls.
243 2018-11-01 21:37:29 The sick world in which we live:

"Slightly exceeding projected revenues, with $62.9bn, the tech giant is up roughly 20% over last year. However, immediately after the announcement, Apple stocks dropped 3.7%, likely because investors had hoped for higher numbers on iPhone sales"
244 2018-11-01 21:37:09 @MadMoneyOnCNBC,@jJimCramer Can we calm a little now?Good thing is I didn't lose S instead I was buying up stocks I couldn't afford before. Now I got a stronger portfolio. enough, I've been using stock market's for a year 3pay bills. live/save while getting my CISCO/MSFTSvR certs
245 2018-11-01 21:37:00 It’s fennel don’t eat the stocks. Chop it up cook in tinfoil with fish on top yum. Gives an anise flavour to the fish.
246 2018-11-01 21:36:29 So that means all the lives lost in the Las Vegas massacre lies in the hands of the you and the Republican Party because you allowed bump stocks to be sold in the USA? And are still allowing them to stay in the USA?
247 2018-11-01 21:36:00 Typical market scam. $aapl money will be rolled into worthless stocks, people will be trapped.
248 2018-11-01 21:35:43 trump-style, Dems could predict....STOCKS WILL CRASH IF REPUBLICANS WIN.  Republicans can not win without cheating.  If republicans win:    1)  foreign countries will pitch USA stocks and bonds    2) Foreign Businesses will curtail business with USA ...they hate trump
249 2018-11-01 21:34:10 $AAPL kills almost every metric and goes down. Guess it was time for them to take some lumps alongside the other FANG stocks, but I expect a solid jump to the $220 range in the next few weeks. Still like the fundamentals, but the technicals still seeing a bit of resistance.

259 2018-11-01 21:32:21 Sounds like it's great for stocks short term. When do you see the next leg down?
260 2018-11-01 21:32:00 Do you have your own open stocks for cookies?
261 2018-11-01 21:32:00 Get short premium, delta neutral prior to earnings. High IVR stocks. Sell just outside expected move. 1.5 SD. Not that tough.
262 2018-11-01 21:31:59 I think I did that the other day. But I’ll send something tomorrow.  In general, being able to deal in US stocks is great and is a real USP. However, being realistic the average UK investor will find it difficult to get any real information on them whereas the FTSE350 should be
263 2018-11-01 21:31:34 Is that good or bad for stocks
264 2018-11-01 21:29:02 Stocks crashing, Businesses Leaving, banned from weddings, funerals, hated in Pittsburgh, and Kanye's dumped you.
Define Winning.
265 2018-11-01 21:28:57 " UEC is in one with an uptrend where similar stocks have had a banner 6 months."  Yes. That is broadly true. Surely there are some uranium stocks that haven't moved much either? I suspect you could do some good work grouping stocks by alpha and beta to U price so far this year?
266 2018-11-01 21:28:10 Disagree completely. Placing the entire effort on 2 KSA is disingenuous, it was an OPEC effort. As well, measuring exports is germain in that they remained elevated, while stocks built. It is as much a function of what they didn't do (reduce exports), as did (maintained exports).
267 2018-11-01 21:26:28 $AAPL decline after earnings disappointment means big win in days and weeks to come for $MCD $CMG, and other stocks not affected by the tech correction and tariff concerns. $IWM

270 2018-11-01 21:25:21 I don't say it lightly. I know he has an impressive record obviously. But years of profit can be wiped out in days.

Buffet also called #BTC rat poison squared. And he said stocks are not in a bubble a few months ago lol. I bet he's about to get #REKT if he's not deceiving us.
271 2018-11-01 21:24:17 Ouch...$AAPL down 5% in after hours due to weak guidance. I don't care how great you think a company is, you don't want to own stocks priced for perfection as we head into a global slowdown. Expect more selling as the market prices in peak growth across the board. #Bearish
272 2018-11-01 21:24:08 I'm long EM but building a short in US stocks
273 2018-11-01 21:23:20 hopefully his stocks will drop lower than cube’s did

277 2018-11-01 21:21:02 Well done Andy

I'm sure we can expect to see plenty more similar moves coming, whether we own the stocks or not, especially in the environment where fear & risk aversion outweighs belief & expectations

Many stocks have drifted to levels where there is no meaningful supply

279 2018-11-01 21:20:19 The strength is Eurodollars today was impressive given how much higher stocks have been the past 3 days I’m guessing it’s somewhat currency related, maybe NFP positioning.
280 2018-11-01 21:19:55 Senators aren't required to divest stocks when elected. If it's important, start a movement. I might even join you. A multimillionaire Sec. of Commerce who is meeting with personal investment cronies needs criticism; your question of Warren deflects it toward a nothing-burger.

288 2018-11-01 21:17:46 They don't exist. Reporting/Statements for a lot of those exchanges non-existent.
289 2018-11-01 21:17:32 I’m very much against this govt’s enthusiasm for banning things, but those FOBTs cross a line. They’re no more a fair sell than are penny stocks or dodgy diamonds being sold to little old ladies over the phone from boiler rooms. £2 limit should have been enacted instantly.
290 2018-11-01 21:17:14 If you're saying "the stock is near all-time lows so whatever they're doing isn't working", then you may not understand what they are doing. I'm not saying the market doesn't get it, I'm saying you don't get it. Jr mining stocks have huge volatility, which is opportunity.

297 2018-11-01 21:13:45 What's bad for them is most own stocks and or are on boards of insurance companies that would be slaughtered by the single payor universal healthcare. That is my guess anyway. Plus it eliminates a lobbying group that spends billions on elections.
298 2018-11-01 21:13:39 apple stocks rise by 20%.
299 2018-11-01 21:13:12 As a day trader,  never buy stocks and hope.
Apple shares will wipe out peo investments as reported earnings tank.
300 2018-11-01 21:12:07 But stocks can go down regardless of any rational reason.
301 2018-11-01 21:12:07 It wasnt, and stocks are valued forward. Apple is too expensive .. decline will end around 10-25%
302 2018-11-01 21:11:02 Kraft Heinz, $KHC. will likely put downward pressure on food stocks tomorrow.

320 2018-11-01 21:05:41 $AAPL down 4% at this time after the #Earnings #Whoopsie!  This should throw a #Monkeywrench into the current rally.  Non Farm Payroll tomorrow will lend more insight.  #Bulls #CanTheyStay #Stocks #StockMarket #BuyTheDip
321 2018-11-01 21:05:18 Stocks like $CHD, $HRL and $MKC have done very well this year, but the consumer staples sector has been in the dog house for over two years.  Both the DJ US Food & Beverage and the DJ US Consumer Goods indexes are still below their July 2016 highs.
322 2018-11-01 21:04:52 Cannabis motif - up 15% last 90 days, 62% 182 days, 194% 365 days. And I have never had thc in my system.  Forget the last 22 days, long term solid cannabis stocks will outperform S&P and Bitcoin (and most alts) by 2X.
323 2018-11-01 21:04:27 @danyscht el aumento de los plazos fijos fue por el desarme de lebac. Esos fondos migraron ahi. No aparece crecimiento de los stocks más allá de eso. No creo q la tasa de leliq (22% sobre pf) haya jugado un rol ahí

Le Joueur X2 affronte le joueur F1. F1 doit se suicider 1 fois pour avoir 2 stocks, et le match commence

That's f**king stupid

350 2018-11-01 20:49:50 Keep in mind many indexes, and stocks, are getting overbought in a downtrend.
351 2018-11-01 20:49:26 Diddy had weskers super from UMvC3 and the last hit homes in on you with a big explosion.  It killed decently from what I saw but I would like to keep the game in the players hands through all interactions to get stocks.  Not a fan of those kind of final smashes.
352 2018-11-01 20:49:02 It's outrageous that the Republicans basically handed him the assault rifle he used to kill cops. I notice you missed that point in your little ad. Make America safe by getting rid of assault weapons and bump stocks

354 2018-11-01 20:48:53 Disappointed...cos I actually own three stocks that went down an average 0.6% today!?
355 2018-11-01 20:48:09 APPLE stock is off -5% after hours... tomorrow it's gonna be a hard day for stocks, Dollar is gonna rebound plus there's NFP
356 2018-11-01 20:47:43 Ok. Sure. Would be nice to see those stocks you're looking at in real time then, maybe? Or post some of your entry/exit levels even if it's after the fact? Good day.
357 2018-11-01 20:47:34 Wrong. That was by far the most commonly used gun. Not wrong about what bump stocks do. And your banning of guns is misleading
358 2018-11-01 20:46:43 I wish I never took my money out the stocks I had years ago 
359 2018-11-01 20:46:42 I had assumed so too but have come to unhappy conclusion that no retail outlet in England (or perhaps GB) stocks it. De rigueur in Ireland. We’re missing out.
360 2018-11-01 20:46:41 On the downside were oil & gas stocks such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell, despite the latter of the two companies reporting positive performance from one of the “strongest-ever” quarters
361 2018-11-01 20:45:50 Oh btw the King is Salman. And AlWaleed has wall street / sillicon valley interests (citi bank stake and biggest shareholder of twitter) + biggest foreign owner of US stocks. not much Washington influence.
362 2018-11-01 20:45:16 Using the stocks as punishment is underrated.

365 2018-11-01 20:44:04 Why were you not commenting on the stock market when it was falling?  And the stock market is meaningless to most US citizens since they cannot afford to buy stocks, Only your rich cronies, the only people who profited from your tax cut scam, can afford to do so.
366 2018-11-01 20:43:58 $aapl when Tim Cook speaks this will fly. Too many "investor" amateurs out there. I buy quality stocks. If i had to own ONE stock, hands down it would be $aapl  . They will raise dividend, buy a strategic company and have BOAT loads of money left over.

You were wrong about the popularity of those guns.
You were wrong about what bump-stocks do.
You were wrong about no Democrats saying that want to ban all guns.

371 2018-11-01 20:40:44 Donald Trump is doing his best Carl Sagen impersonation— billions and billions and billions— of dollars.  The man can’t count to 20 without taking off his shoes and stocks.  He has no idea what he is talking about.

375 2018-11-01 20:38:01 We have got to stop listening to the HATE speech from Hollywood.U will not even give @realDonaldTrump a chance.

384 2018-11-01 20:33:23 Exactly. You always want to see PI’s make profits but given history people are putting serious cash and faith into a company that consistently disappoints. And one with no cash and an interest-bearing director loan at that 
385 2018-11-01 20:33:11 1929 and 2000 were different.  Primary finding of Pecora Commission was impact of opacity.  SEC created to bring transparency.  In 2000, market tumbled.  Investors understood they had info to assess risk of tech stocks so didn't have greater exposure than could afford to lose.
386 2018-11-01 20:32:39 The top five stocks that closed lower today were $ALL, $FISV, $HBI, $PKI, and $GE.
387 2018-11-01 20:32:15 It's still a neurotic market -- but today was mostly neurotic to the upside. A sampling of stocks up more than 5% Thurs.:

AdvancedMicro $AMD +11.0%
DowDuPont $DWDP +8.1
AppliedMaterials $AMAT +7.5
Hasbro $HAS +6.4
Alibaba $BABA +6.3
Stanley $SWK +6.0
Netflix $NFLX +5.2
388 2018-11-01 20:31:38 Does anyone else find it a little disconcerting that the fate of US indices hangs on a handful of stocks?
389 2018-11-01 20:31:34 Global stocks begin November stronger, lifted by results, trade war progress
390 2018-11-01 20:30:48 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $NFX, $CHD, $WYNN, $WDC, and $AMD.

393 2018-11-01 20:30:10 Yeah i get your point, but im not out here trying to teach anyone/everyone how to trade, im not selling anything, more trying to provide guidance as to what stocks i look at, whats in play etc. others need to develop their own style/niche, no point copying what i do!
394 2018-11-01 20:29:23 Global stocks start November with broad rally.
395 2018-11-01 20:28:33 Yup... pretty much avoiding FANG stocks in general... I have a feeling things are going to be choppy for them in the near future...
396 2018-11-01 20:28:25 no. i just want to buy cheaper stocks...
397 2018-11-01 20:27:22 positive sentiment across EM currencies, investors eyeing bargains. SA market are cheap, specific stocks like Naspers couple days ago, up about 17% in 2 days but still down about 14% for the year
398 2018-11-01 20:27:00 Pre-midterm election analysis in Friday's @BioWorld concludes:  Divided 116th Congress would maintain status quo for #biopharma and "remove a worst-case scenario for drug stocks"
399 2018-11-01 20:25:40 does this mean I can kind of close my portfolio and move on with my life.? So used to it bumped at 58- at night and drop in the morning.  Maybe no more buy sell buy sell..  i feel a litle less stressed..  The stocks are my income, savings, living money.
400 2018-11-01 20:25:37 Is the MAGA ETF still on track for 2019?
Could someone explain the basket of stocks?
401 2018-11-01 20:25:19 Stocks jump after Trump announces "trade progress and that talks are moving along nicely with China." Too funny.
402 2018-11-01 20:23:43 Me: oh my god can we HOLD UP on the Christmas stuff!! Halloween just ended!!!

403 2018-11-01 20:23:02 Stocks have upside bias. A tactical asset allocation model probably should too. We look for every reason to stay fully invested.
404 2018-11-01 20:21:53 Licensing, rigorous background checks on all, sales of guns, mental health evaluations, daily background checks as long as you own a gun like they have in Canada, banning bump stocks (Vegas) banning high capacity magazines and assault, style weapons like AR-15...
405 2018-11-01 20:21:06 Stocks recover for 3rd day on the back of Wall Street's worst month in 7 years
406 2018-11-01 20:20:57 watch ur mouth
407 2018-11-01 20:20:31 So you’re down when stocks are down? 
408 2018-11-01 20:20:24 To me, IF they were to drastically manipulate it, (for financial gain), they could probably only ever do it once or twice before people would say 'screw this' and leave, (and again, this already happens in stocks, forex, and futures trading), and people seem to agree to use these
409 2018-11-01 20:20:18 Quarterly earning should be removed from all stocks. Manipulating share prices and speculation doesn’t help the markets and the investors bottom line.

411 2018-11-01 20:18:11 Pleased to see a few peeps having a better day 
What today shows and it’s only one day is you’re a fool if you think you can call what direction the market will go in or when that’s why I stay fully invested.  It’s not timing issues but what stocks you hold that really matters.
412 2018-11-01 20:18:07 AAPL is up just a handful of a percent, but with the upcoming reports of new iPhone sales, stocks are expected to rise further. #SUACCF18

414 2018-11-01 20:17:49  Nasdaq recent rebound statistics:

- Nasdaq rebounded 513.05 points from its correction low, that is 7.41% (6,922.83 low of 29 October to 7,435.88 today’s high)

420 2018-11-01 20:16:23 My siblings talked me into investing in stocks. I hate both of them right now
421 2018-11-01 20:16:16 Not all shareholders are wealthy Kamal. And many working-class Americans buy stocks...making us "shareholders"!
422 2018-11-01 20:15:24 Also a nice bounce today for the China Internet stocks. I sold some $YY @ $67.75 for a gain of $7.22 per share from just two weeks ago, continue to hold $SINA.
423 2018-11-01 20:14:43 Opened a 1dte QQQ strangle before close, 7x 173c / 171p
(and one 170p to sate my bear bias)

AAPL earnings will make or break tech stocks tomorrow, at least initially. A big move in either direction and I'll be happy.
424 2018-11-01 20:14:38 My mum always stocks up on these so we can have them throughout the year LOOL. Our entire dining room is full of these crisps. V nice though 10/10
425 2018-11-01 20:14:29 It is pretty impressive that he was barred from trading stocks before he turned 20. Puts us all to shame.
426 2018-11-01 20:14:24 In fairness to @SenGracePOE, the delay should not be attributed to her since she just made sure that all safety concerns are addressed before deployment. In fact, Dalian has to make the necessary adjustments to adapt the rolling stocks to the current rail conditions.
427 2018-11-01 20:12:39 All lithium stocks ran hard in the US overnight. November looking bright. $AUZ $AGY $NVA $SYA #lithium #asx
428 2018-11-01 20:12:22 World stocks generally higher: US +1.1%; Europe +.4%. Investors overexcited with Trump suggesting progress with China. Caution prudent when investing based on a tweet. Still, markets can move higher as long as no November shocks. Long-term still positive for stocks versus bonds.
429 2018-11-01 20:11:59 All three of those times, stocks were kind of close to 1 month highs.  When we are still reeling from recent losses, 3 day winning streaks this strong have seen average drawdowns of 4.5% within a month, over 15% within a year.  More than twice the average downside risk.
430 2018-11-01 20:11:33 $AMZN, $ABMD -- Today had lots of the stocks on our watch list following through on their recent reversal moves.  Amazon led the pack with a $67.52 move on the day, and Abiomed with an earnings-fueled $35.74 move.
431 2018-11-01 20:11:06 I am just a bond guy, but why should I care if my stocks are higher today due to a short squeeze?
432 2018-11-01 20:10:50 Yeah I think pot stocks will do great overall. Personally I stick with cryptos though...
433 2018-11-01 20:10:48 Good day for the bulls. Stocks rise for 3rd day as investors pick up battered shares in tech, heavy industry, housing and small-stock sectors.

Dow ends +264, +1.1% to 25,380. S&P +1.1%, Nasdaq +1.8%.

Small stocks lead: Russell 2000 +2.2%.

Winners top losers by more than 3 to 1
434 2018-11-01 20:10:01 Anyway I understand what you are saying! some ppl pump good and undervalued stocks! Not always a pump and dump! always follow your DD IMO!
435 2018-11-01 20:09:36 the question was about pfizer. also the big tobacco stocks are losing cigarette sales because they're all switching to e-cigs and vaping because they can once again target kids (and their stocks are going up)
436 2018-11-01 20:09:22 They need to cut corporate tax AGAIN, so they may buy back their own stocks AGAIN to avoid a major stock market correction (AGAIN) before the 2020 election.

446 2018-11-01 20:02:32 Up or down I think $AAPL’s ER will determine where stocks drift this quarter
447 2018-11-01 20:02:27 There are a few people that are great contra-indicators on specific stocks. I’ve been fortunate to identify some of these individuals as contra-indicators. Still waiting for the -1 correlation to break down, but fortunately it hasn’t

454 2018-11-01 20:00:51 damn..only 2 equities on the GSE gained in the whole of October. All other stocks remained unchanged or lost. 10 stocks suffered double digit drawdowns #Ghana
455 2018-11-01 20:00:46 That’s income, not wealth. Hours worked for money paid = income. Wealth is different. It’s assets. Stocks, property, things that you own that have money and generate more money. How are those regulated? If they’re not regulated at all, that’s cool. I’m just asking.
456 2018-11-01 20:00:02 Yet more than 50% of the country is not in the middle class, more than 93 percent of stocks are owned by the top 20%, and families cannot afford childcare and healthcare. How Wall Street is doing today doesn’t affect most people. Only 38% of country even has a 401K account.

461 2018-11-01 19:57:34 Agreed. I used the 1987 example as a metaphor, not literally, referring to the fact that this #crash cannot be allowed to be protracted given the importance of stocks to Fed Tax receipts in the form of cap gains and IRA distributions, i.e. it'll be all done in 6 mths or less imo.

468 2018-11-01 19:53:31 Stocks like $JNJ and $PG look strong.  I'd attribute this to solid buying and people positioning their portfolios more defensively.

523 2018-11-01 19:22:39 Because stocks are overvalued and btc is undervalued!
524 2018-11-01 19:22:20 I heard about one documentary on trappers and it said that if there work rate was applied to stocks, the uk would be the lesding economy(which makes logical sense)

527 2018-11-01 19:21:33 If we look back into history for the character of present sects in social media stocks, we shall find none that unlike this. In the case of Facebook, the gains didn’t catch on until mid-2013. After a tough start to a much-ballyhooed IPO in 2012, FB found its footing in 2013.

531 2018-11-01 19:19:56 Please don’t feed my dream where rationality and kindness prevail and Trump is impeached, asset stripped and imprisoned, the GOP is disbanded in a swathe of countrywide humiliation, and in the UK every Brexiteer ends up doing a long stint of in the stocks before being castrated.

548 2018-11-01 19:10:57 Whats even worse is that their stocks dont even show signs of volatility. Which is bad for business

551 2018-11-01 19:09:24 Dunno.  Seems like the perceived direction of the rate tends to carry more weight than the rate itself, in terms of whether bonds vs. stocks (or cash/T-bills) are more attractive.
552 2018-11-01 19:09:18 That would be great.
Stocks in the centre of town where people could throw fruit and veg at them.

559 2018-11-01 19:04:06 This a wonderful learning moment for you. If you don’t OWN (assets, i.e. stocks, bonds, property, small business, etc.) then you are going to be subject to someone else’s will. They will decide your worth(pay), how much you will pay, etc. Best advice I’ve ever given...

635 2018-11-01 18:20:17 thx @bespokeinvest The stock market is not the economy. Jobless claims high in 2009 great buy signal, now this low is worse (for stocks) than '07. #BakesTakes_

You keep on sitting in your corner being Debi downer wallowing in your hatred of our country and all things Trump while the rest of us actually live
763 2018-11-01 17:19:45 Owning stocks is so exciting like I could end up making $10 or $1,000,000, you never know
764 2018-11-01 17:19:22 Why the hell is this up like 280% on that news???
765 2018-11-01 17:19:16 So far this quarter earnings of quality small and mid cap companies are nothing less than fantastic, as these stocks have corrected so much in the past you will see sharp rallies in quality stocks, don't be surprised if small and mid cap index outperform the broader markets.
766 2018-11-01 17:19:10 Sri Lanka stocks ballooned 2.70 percent Thursday, the highest single day gain in more than six years, crossing the 6,000-point psychological barrier. #MREra
767 2018-11-01 17:18:41 When I was in high school in the 80s, we also had business classes which showed you how to write checks, balance a check book, create a budget and did mock investments in stocks which taught us how to read the market. my daughter is a HS freshman and I don’t see that offered
768 2018-11-01 17:18:15 That’s because of all the tick flip tards..Always stacking the ask and slamming the bid..That’s the prob with big float stocks..

772 2018-11-01 17:16:52 Cigarette shipments are down 3% again. Why is it that when Juul got a letter from the FDA, tobacco stocks gained $20billion in value? I thought Juul was big tobacco? Why is that when they get an FDA letter big tobacco stocks gained $20billion value? Cause Juul isn’t BT
773 2018-11-01 17:16:40 This is the problem. U want more people to donate yet you are prioritising regular donors. If people never start giving they can't become regular donors! And you just said stocks are low. So now is the time you need more donors to come fwd yet u cannot accommodate when they do

I don’t want to try and lab online, but get some guy who has all his items turned on because he’s close to me and we both wanted stocks.

I hope it takes high priority on the items, because I’m refusing to play with those on in a ranked setting

785 2018-11-01 17:10:58 I don't look for fancy price patterns. It's crucial to look for price patterns EVERYONE sees. Why? So they'll buy also! #stocks #charts
786 2018-11-01 17:10:49 I'm not one to advertise predictions, but I don't think this winter will be very interesting. More likely a price in next summer for a doubling, then a real doubling during 2020. The market dynamics are very different from both stocks and most commodities because of supply.
787 2018-11-01 17:10:49 Will be interesting to see how the senate goes in the USA, how that affects stocks and how that effects Chinese economy ergo Canadian real estate. Should be fun. 
788 2018-11-01 17:09:34 the china stocks seem pretty upbeat about it
789 2018-11-01 17:08:48 Sounds like something that a man that already has children would say.

Children are the worst investment. It’s blindly purchasing stocks you can see for 9 months, and can influence but have little control over for 18yrs.

With that said, I’d agree with you if I had children.

797 2018-11-01 17:03:12 The story is that 99% of those advertisements were scams and ponzi schemes.... They SHOULD have been banned.

Any legitimate crypto coin/token doesn't need advertising to get investors. 

Have you ever seen Google or Microsoft post advertisements for people to buy their stocks?

813 2018-11-01 16:58:40 Imo, Trump knows that a recession is coming in his term. He’s trying to shift blame to Fed and saying that “if Dems win midterms, stocks go down.” He knows that market is frothy and that debt is unsustainable. He wants people to view him as the solution to fixing this long term.

823 2018-11-01 16:55:29 I know right? Shorting is hard enough because stocks tend to go up. But why put yourself through the pain of trying to short a stock that will go up no matter what the news is? Lose billions, still goes up. Some FUD works during new product ramps, but short lived.

852 2018-11-01 16:40:31 The thing is, this is not like other bear markets, where people can allocate from stocks to bonds. Now, both stocks and bonds are plunging. The only place to go is cash. And that is a big problem for these funds who must be stayed 60% invested any given time by rule
853 2018-11-01 16:40:17 Bump-stocks, har förbjudits idag, tror jag, det blev en herrans debatt efter Vegas, men de är ett tillbehör och köpes fristående från vapnet.

892 2018-11-01 16:25:48 @Scotia_iTRADE Can you provide any updates on the progress of allowing Stop Loss/Limit Orders for @CSE_News tickers from my inquiry in September? Some awesome IPO’s coming. Can’t sit in front of my computer all day to enter/exit a position for CSE stocks.
893 2018-11-01 16:25:38 In stocks, news like that presented by $LINK today would cause an instant upwards correction of 50% or greater. Crypto markets are still very, very imperfect.
894 2018-11-01 16:25:19 $AMD, $GE, $F, $BAC, and $MU are the top five most active stocks at noon today.

898 2018-11-01 16:23:54 @sephoracanada  The amount of Out Of Stocks is incredible. #sundayriley products are scarce if any. The biggest reason I SPEND 1000$ / year at least and shop only with u is the 20% off sale. #DISSAPPOINTED #NOTHAPPY
899 2018-11-01 16:23:14 In 2013 saw 50stocks @ 5-20% BV, 1PE, 5-10%Mcap:annual Sales . 2018-19 will give atleast 25such stocks,they may trade at such lucrative valuations due to any reason like management perspection,Temporary business down-cycle ,Moderate-High Debt, Bear market sentiments . #100baggers
900 2018-11-01 16:22:24 True, E&Ps look like they are taking it well.  The refiners and oil service stocks, however.
901 2018-11-01 16:22:22 @HalftimeReport cannot get too positive with the Weiss Put in play....so many stocks on sale per Jimbo...yes so true.
902 2018-11-01 16:21:34 i want to want to learn about stocks, podcasts, music, apps, business, the economy, our politics, art, and everything about this world. so much shit out there to be uninformed about. even if i never use it in life it’s just good to know about all of it, and how it operates.
903 2018-11-01 16:21:12 Never confuse paper stocks and jawboned production with actual physical barrels, up or down.
904 2018-11-01 16:20:08 Stocks not giving a care, yet.
905 2018-11-01 16:19:36 no belief it gets/stays bad again. The fed telegraphs exactly what they are doing so inv do not need to pay for unknowns. There is certainty that stocks go only in one direction higher lends itself to this. The fact that vol did not reach Feb move says inv are not worried
906 2018-11-01 16:18:57 @djvlad shout out to Vlad stocks
907 2018-11-01 16:17:24 Trump is capitulating from the tone of this tweet. Look at the reaction from FX and foreign stocks, up bigly much more so than local. MAGA my ass lol
908 2018-11-01 16:17:05 bet you’re just mad bc you didn’t buy stocks when obama was president  economy’s so much better now that you would have made a fortune selling them over the 10 year time period

912 2018-11-01 16:16:20 Yet the Oil stocks not reacting to the WTI move this time around like in October.  Absorbed it quite well
913 2018-11-01 16:16:16 The NASDAQ leading US stocks higher again as it rises over 1% again today.
914 2018-11-01 16:16:16 Well said. No reason not to be excited for the low stocks #FIRESale especially if young plan on making withdrawals for a decade or so

918 2018-11-01 16:14:58 Change in pattern finally creeping in ?  Oil down $2 this morning and Cdn Oil stocks absorbed it quite well. My list is still up on the day. Suspect as soon as Oil makes it's key reversal low and rallies, we will get torque in the names on next leg. So far so good
919 2018-11-01 16:14:36 Smalls you mean well, and I have no issue with you... just want to say you don’t need to pump your stocks so much throughout the day and say what they should be worth... let the data and fundamentals do the talking and sit back and relax... too much talk about what a stock should
920 2018-11-01 16:14:26 No choice if Dems take House you get Pelosi leader of House, Dems take Senate, Schumer , of course they head their committees with Adam Schiff, Warren, etc., doomed....economy plummet, stocks plummet, retract tax breaks, open borders Obamacare , onepayer/Medicaid/Medicare

922 2018-11-01 16:14:07 Surely a lot of short covering on #stocks and #index trading out of the gate today. The #short index position was the crowded pro trade in Oct.  Now the unwind and new money plays.  #hedgefunds

925 2018-11-01 16:13:38 ah I see.  I have had some of these pot stocks since early 2016, so I don't jump in and out so much.  But I do like to add on the good ones when I see value.
926 2018-11-01 16:13:36 While the USD is weaker after a couple of days of gains, stocks are extending gains this afternoon.

928 2018-11-01 16:13:02 From a TA perspective on the 1D it’s trading under the Kijun (and has been since 10/10).  But this is the $1T monster.  Personally I believe the FAANG and tech stocks will lead the way for the next recession but you’re right on the info last year.  Thanks for the insight. 
929 2018-11-01 16:12:56 I realize it's more on @Instacart than you. I'll contact them after I get my delivery. Now, the out of stocks on basics like Kraft mac n cheese...

935 2018-11-01 16:08:49 Thank's Andy.  I got this guitar through a swap for another one. If I had my choice now I would have bought a Mahogany / Spruce top guitar. I realise that some types of mahogany are also becoming rarer & stocks need to be built up before much more is taken.
936 2018-11-01 16:08:30 The good thing about a quiet market is the natural buyers and sellers in the stocks show you exactly where to be long $SMH 's , China , $IBB 's , Short energy $XLE etc  #TheStrat

944 2018-11-01 16:06:23 Today is the Trump trade: stocks up, oil down, rates down, dollar down.  All the things he wants 5 days before the election. Should we be shocked he dropped the “had a good conversation with China’s Xi” headline today? I think not. @LukeGromen @fxmacro @ErikSTownsend

956 2018-11-01 16:00:09 Bottom fishers, these stocks are within 5% of their 52-week lows
957 2018-11-01 15:59:57 Absolutely. $CNBX, $AXIM, and others have maintained a Market Cap around $100M for a while. $NXEN is easily at their level and clearly showing as much promise.

Keep in mind, those stocks have run to $400M - $750M Market Caps. Not to mention, $RCGP was over $1B a week ago!
958 2018-11-01 15:59:56 Yeah for the most part it’s all charting and catching trends. Biggest difference from stocks is you’re dealing with very minimal price movement aka pips. It’s been good, especially with stock market being so volatile this time of year
959 2018-11-01 15:59:40 I would say investors need to punish CNN parent company Time Warner by selling off stocks and buying back into it. Lack of leadership at both CNN and Time Warner have allowed this kind of high powered rhetoric to run amuck.
960 2018-11-01 15:59:10 Again - for the 20th+ time in 2018 - the importance of loading stocks in my Watch List when alerted during quiet periods was demonstrated with $PJET today & $EVSV over the last few days.

963 2018-11-01 15:58:22 You keep plugging the stock market when 80% of the stocks are owned by the top 10%. What are you doing for the rest of America except raising the debt so the rich can get richer. Wonder why your approval ratings remain in the toilet. Look in the mirror instead of blaming media.
964 2018-11-01 15:57:52 @jimcramer Jim....The reason stocks don’t trade on fundamentals anymore is, the market caters to the masses and is headline driven.  Ninety years ago, one had to trade on the fundamentals, because stock analysis was all there was.  #madtweets

975 2018-11-01 15:50:15 Two of the industries/areas that I've followed closely and has been loading the last months has been Biotech and Chinese stocks. $XBI and $FXI are both going crazy today - and the latter on ONE positive note from Trump on the talks with China on trade. Told you in the radio!
976 2018-11-01 15:50:06 Interesting.  So what would happen to those banks monthly exchange costs if the SEC's Access Fee pilot cut rebates by at least 50% in 3000 stocks?
977 2018-11-01 15:49:56 Apologies you are correct. I meant to say decelerating. My mind is in a few different places. But the environment is not good for stocks especially tech stocks for the next few months.

987 2018-11-01 15:47:48 Idea is to identify opportunities in volatile stocks & Position ourselves in a high reward to risk situation
988 2018-11-01 15:47:14 The great rotation from "worry about junk bc stocks and the U.S. economy rolling over" to "worry about junk bc oil"

991 2018-11-01 15:46:27 Cant go long when stocks like $MSFT $ADBE $TWTR r red since morning.. remember these were the strong picks that held solid during October crash
992 2018-11-01 15:46:24 Stocks are ripping like the China deal is signed but bonds trading on economy getting weaker- both prob can't be right...
993 2018-11-01 15:45:31 $ACB $CGC $CRON .. stocks are very oversold.
994 2018-11-01 15:45:14 I see the difference in my stocks and mutual funds. I see the difference in my pay and taxes. You can’t argue with the facts. Almost 4% GDP, unemployment numbers way down. I lived through eight years of higher taxes, less pay, mutual funds stagnant, etc. Hope is back!
995 2018-11-01 15:45:03 No, I think he understands basic economics and the history of rent-control efforts. Sure, it helps a select few, at the expense to everyone else and a general reduction in housing stocks. Both he and I agree that it should be a local decision, but Prop. 10 goes to far.

1007 2018-11-01 15:40:50 I strongly disagree with one of ideas in this article. Yes, during Q2 reporting being merely in line with guidance took stocks down. Last 3 weeks had an effect on markets' expectations which have now been greatly LOWERED. IMHO in line report from $AAPL takes markets up. FAANG!

1022 2018-11-01 15:36:46 I'm noting US MJ stocks trending differently than Canadian. Are US stocks finally separating themselves? Any thought?
1023 2018-11-01 15:36:42 stocks push to highs as China's Xi is coming around on trade... says both sides should push for trade solution that is mutually acceptable
1024 2018-11-01 15:36:23 It offsets the risk.. someone just showed me other stocks that were up for fda approval.. shares rise on speculation but if it's denied shares drop in a big way.. he actually said I'd be wise to consider selling some of it a day before at a profit just in case

1026 2018-11-01 15:36:14 @RyanOScribner hey I'm a big fan and subscribe to your YouTube. I just want to know when do you sell your stocks? 15%-25%? Or do you hold them for longer or less? Just want to hear your thoughts. #stockstowatch
1027 2018-11-01 15:35:37 Great work Adam. Agreed. However, I won't shorting USD/JPY, I'll be shorting SPY, QQQ, and a whole bunch of formerly high-flying individual stocks instead  #SPX

'It's a mistake' to write off FANG even as the stocks could still go lower,…
1029 2018-11-01 15:35:12 O Governo indiano doa amanhã 10 viaturas 4×4 ao Instituto de Cereais. Lavagem de imagem? Em 2017 a #Índia prejudicou muitos camponeses moçambicanos que viram seus stocks de feijão boer apodrecendo, após terem investido por causa da garantia do País asiático de que iria comprar.
1030 2018-11-01 15:34:58 Haven't seen yet a write up on retailers getting hurt overnight with stretched margins. Especially with these after hours moves on stocks, those holding options on leverage would have received margin warnings or more. Maybe it's different this time....
1031 2018-11-01 15:34:58 Not from stocks or bonds. From the sale of a family mfg business that my father worked long hard hours his entire life to build. The government thinking they’re entitled of any of that is insanity. Taxes are stealing. Only people who ‘get money back’ say such foolish things.
1032 2018-11-01 15:34:43 Can we do without 'Paper' (stocks)??

1040 2018-11-01 15:32:34 Tech stocks plunged in October, suffering worst month since 2008 recession...

1041 2018-11-01 15:32:26 A decent start for US stocks following rises in Europe.

1043 2018-11-01 15:32:06 Stocks continue upward Trend into November.  MBS has since been declining (currently down 6bps), as Mortgage Rates have been rising.  Yields are currently down slightly to 3.15%.
1044 2018-11-01 15:31:45 Or more than likely just a bounce. Those stocks are down 40% almost in a straight line 50+ degree angle

1063 2018-11-01 15:25:31 @jimcramer Canadian pot stocks hit their baseline last week and I believe that these stocks have no place to go but up. When there is such a high demand for product internationally sales are going to skyrocket.

1068 2018-11-01 15:23:26 1/2 Lost in the narrative shuffle of October’s Tech stock rout: the link between market expectations for long-term interest rates & high PE stocks. FAANG stocks with low multiples ( $AAPL) radically outperformed those with lofty valuations ( $NFLX & $AMZN).
1069 2018-11-01 15:23:16 pretty sure Midler has money in the bank and stocks as well-

1070 2018-11-01 15:23:16 Agreed but the rule of law really must prevail & our prisons are dangerous places thanks to lack of funding.

And we don't make stocks anymore 
1071 2018-11-01 15:22:03 I think it is upper hand rhetoric. We know the US has been crapping it since stocks started to slide but China has been ignoring their requests for meetings.

1159 2018-11-01 14:50:10 I think they would probably be good for short ideas.  When the magazines cotton onto something the good news or bad news is already in the price.  They do get some right.  But are willing to tip absolute junk i.e. story stocks.  So I think on average they lose people money.

1198 2018-11-01 14:38:12 I've been steadly increasing my portfolio in Canadian REITs since 2015, and it's been imune to all market swings. I would cash when I though it's over priced and bought back later. Also, I would get divident paid as buyback stocks. Highly recommended and STRESS FREE!!!!
1199 2018-11-01 14:38:11 So.. in order to engineer this... they had to buy the most beat up stocks first... Soo... look at the $BKX while the mkt down big on Monday... BOOM $BKX on fire, now it's $SOX and $RUT - they have to buy all the turds and run them UP...

1262 2018-11-01 14:14:51 Not really strong with RDSPs but my understanding is most banks only let you buy in-house products like funds. TD Waterhouse may still be an exception and allow trading of stocks, ETFs, etc. in the RDSP. I’d recommend a conservative strategy with that kind of account tho

1386 2018-11-01 13:36:41 The $SPX better rally because the $TNX is also rallying to 3.17% now.... 

Despite a loss of -7.5%, stocks really haven't gotten any relief from lower rates. Entire yield curve still far above mid-September when markets peaked.
1387 2018-11-01 13:36:30 L&T, UPL above 200-DMA

UPL, Larsen & Toubro, Berger Paints, Concor, Ipca Labs and Indraprastha Gas witnessed positive breakouts and traded above their 200-DMA. ITC, Dabur India, Magadh Sugar, Britannia and Mahindra Logistics featured among stocks that traded below their 200-DMA.
1388 2018-11-01 13:36:29 Stocks on the come up!  Should pull out but I’m a try the long haul
1389 2018-11-01 13:35:53 Today we will watch only one stock again, our biggest, and a fan favorite (but for Android cranks):  $AAPL.  It likes $220-$222 but overseas sales may be softer than usual.  I have no idea and I don't trade it.  But we'll run stocks up in great anticipation of good news ;)
1390 2018-11-01 13:35:29 For the record I have next to zero knowledge or experience with the stock market. lol.
1391 2018-11-01 13:34:44 Not sure of that. With all institutional players offering #bitcoin products I wouldn't be so sure that will happen. And I always thought that logic of fractions of #BTC to be flawed.  Any normie would probably prefer a small share of Amazon or Google than penny stocks.
1392 2018-11-01 13:34:40 @AppleNews @AppleSupport 

The stocks app never works bc you’re trying to force too much data into the app via Apple news. I have heard multiple complaints with the new launch. You’ve also eliminated 5yr and 10yr charting. Bring that back. 

Very frustrating
1393 2018-11-01 13:34:16 I don’t know if this is good or bad but looking at their most recent 8-k filing... They added 8,900,000 common stock shares and removed the Cap on the number shares an excutive Officer may be granted. (On 10/26/18). To me it looks like they are expecting quite the pay day soon.
1394 2018-11-01 13:34:02 Sensex evenly poised
With 15 stock gaining and an equal number of stocks losing, Sensex remained evenly poised. Among the gainers, bank, auto and metal counters dominated. IT, pharma, financial and FMCG stocks led the losers.
1395 2018-11-01 13:33:22 Same, slight edge in the 1st. Chess had a slip up and then one like dry spot.  I think this battle was good for both of their stocks tho. But as far as best chess, that's still the one that battled Saga and Roc

1408 2018-11-01 13:25:43 All true.  Having said all this I am still amazed at the low quality of tips.  Conviviality and London Mining are two The Telegraph tipped that went bust.

1415 2018-11-01 13:23:54 @contessabrewer  Idea. Have a segment with top 2 casino analysts & see how much they think Wynn & MGM stocks will jump when China tariff problem is resolved. Both stocks are severely undervalued & I think a 20% uptick is in the cards. Best buys in mkt now.

1421 2018-11-01 13:22:33 HFT

Crude oil and commodities cannot have their prices grossly inflated by HFT for too long, as a black market would be created trading those in real human prices. 

That is not the case with stocks and currencies. Those are digital, not real assets.

1427 2018-11-01 13:19:13 Popular trader magazines are in a no-win situation when it comes to giving good stock tips. Their hot stock tips tend to become a kind of jinx on that stock because every time it prompts enough readers to buy that hot stocks then that will often be the top.

1430 2018-11-01 13:18:01 I actually think that in big money stocks such as $DCIX, charts play a bigger roll than smaller pennies. It might be shipping season but that doesnt mean itll go straight vertical. The patterns have been consistent and have made for some good trading opps
1431 2018-11-01 13:17:46 Francis two things:  /1/.   All of the MMT academics get it (and also deal with things like stocks).  /2/.  Then there are lay people.  Some get the finder points.  Some may not.  The ones who do are speaking to a lay audience.  Simplification is going to happen

1447 2018-11-01 13:09:05 2 tips to improve your trading performance: 

1) Stop following too many stocks. Know 3-5 high-quality stocks inside out.

2) Know 1 chart pattern in 1 time frame. My favorite one is buying an uptrending stock curling back up after a correction on a daily time frame.

1461 2018-11-01 13:02:41 Regarding the stockmarket: 

I was 55% cash in the last 3 weeks of October. I noticed things going south around the 4th of Oct.  I'm glad to see people were sticking to sanctuary stocks while the sell off engaged. 

Last thing: keep an eye on the VIX (VXX) this morning.
1462 2018-11-01 13:02:20 I have one rule for wild swings in this market. When in doubt stay out. Better to be patient.

1631 2018-11-01 11:22:50 Rally ahead? German stocks overriding positive. #Volkswagen top mover again. #wikifolio over all -0,44% (except #MGX included) after +3,6% yesterday. #Wirecard down 0,9 #Tesla flat and MGX not easy to catch (current +3% after news)
1632 2018-11-01 11:22:21 I worked as a fisherman in the late 80s in AK and the stocks were dropping noticably then.

1634 2018-11-01 11:21:25 Not sure in1-2 years as election time is arriving. But, in 7-10 years, I am highly hopeful. Adding mostly known names with 20 or above RoCE stocks. 1-2 risky bets in smallcap and currently loss-making largecaps.
1635 2018-11-01 11:18:31 5MAs turning up and might dead cross 10MA on FAANNG stocks. I won’t be playing puts...

1638 2018-11-01 11:16:42 Is it a signal to buy stocks?
1639 2018-11-01 11:15:59 Sadly no but soem small details would help. Do you suggest INF violation is massive or do you refer to  russian non-strategic nuclear stocks?
1640 2018-11-01 11:15:40 WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

** U.S. stocks as of 7:10am set to open UP triple digits at 124 points.

** Asia stocks kick off November with mostly positive overnight results; 

** European stocks climb to 2-week high; 

** Oil prices fall on signs of rising supplies.
1641 2018-11-01 11:15:37 No clue who this guy is but I know about Pittsburgh,Parkland,Vegas,Newtown,Santa Fe and Aurora.When are you going to do something to prevent another mass shooting? Bumps stocks?Background checks?Waiting Period? You’ve done nothing. And you said you would. Another lie.
1642 2018-11-01 11:12:20 Nifty, Sensex end largely flat; IT stocks top drag: Indian shares ended little changed on Thursday as losses in IT stocks, pressured by a strong rupee, marginally outweighed gains in the financial sector.

1648 2018-11-01 11:09:44 Similarly,  if all of my stocks triple over the next 4 yrs due to my ability to judge mgmt turnaround skills,  I too will become wealthy
1649 2018-11-01 11:07:54 It happens either that way. It's stock clearance. At the same time, attracts customers for other valid products. Most times old stocks are cleared off by offers rather than disposal at loss
1650 2018-11-01 11:07:40 Agree regarding caution as sector is basing. Also could be further off takes more material. Right now all lithium stocks have been sell news or short the pop.
1651 2018-11-01 11:05:49 I'm surprised that major names such as KDDI or docomo fell as if it were like emerging stocks!!
1652 2018-11-01 11:05:27 Avoid making so many losses that u sell good stocks to pay for them
1653 2018-11-01 11:04:07 I agree. Long live Apple!  And FAANG+ stocks!

1663 2018-11-01 10:58:40 it's funny because we gave corporations a trillion dollars just so they could pump their stocks and then sell retail the top
1664 2018-11-01 10:58:04 Oh right! Yeah, it's far too 2015, and I'm surprised they aren't cleaning things up - since their stocks are falling really fast.

(you can probably tell I'm really opinionated and passionate with all this hahaha)

1672 2018-11-01 10:50:48 I fear that market isn't going to move (at least up) until ER. And ER is not only about financial matters but, quite important, about current shares outstanding.

1688 2018-11-01 10:41:07 What's staggering here is the size of the Beijing put:
-RMB rate

-SoEs & "private" firms
-GDP growth
-...

Nothing is allowed to adjust down. Different from response to prev. downturn. Determined to find where limits of debt capacity are.

#AskArunThukral
1715 2018-11-01 10:25:27 Think of bitcoin as some rare pokemon trading cards that no one gives a fuck except for few maniacs. Why would you invest in something that has value when you can buy mortages, stocks, or dollars.
1716 2018-11-01 10:22:36 More or less the only thing I'd watch for 3 hours is the Trump family (including Jared fucking Kushner) in the stocks being pelted with various custard pies / sewage. 4K, Multi-cam set up. I'd watch that

1744 2018-11-01 10:04:26 An incredibly obtuse statement that doesn’t begin to address the issues truly confronting a majority of middle class citizens who aren’t even in stocks, much less those on the lower end of the economic scale.
1745 2018-11-01 10:04:20 Otherwise you’re treating stocks as a source of free money for companies.
1746 2018-11-01 10:03:42 I read Graham hence I always purchase stocks post thoroughly assessing every parameter,
Even I've made mistakes,
I'm sorry you've burnt your money with Ortel, all I meant was you simply can't conclude that there's something hanky-panky just by quoting stock price.
1747 2018-11-01 10:03:18 The value of stocks (denominated in £’a) is to a significant extent dependent on the available financial assets. So I’d say it makes sense to treat them as a liability.
1748 2018-11-01 10:01:51 stocks will see next seasons if they are still in life
1749 2018-11-01 10:00:28 I believe this can be done on our own. Keep track of 5-10 stocks with good fundamentals and long term prospect. Invest in them every month fixed amount. Keep reviewing the companies once in a while and make sure none of the company is reporting any serious issues like governance

1751 2018-11-01 09:59:40 SDG target 14.4 is among those perhaps suffering from nations' collective and individual failure to list, prioritise or advertise targets in rough order of deadline/urgency:

"Restore fish stocks in the shortest time feasible."
1752 2018-11-01 09:58:47 That's true, but that was before agriculture and technology , with both of those things we've increased the carrying capacity of the world to false level, so to get back to a state where nature can do that, we would need a mass die off of humans and all captive breeding stocks
1753 2018-11-01 09:58:12 Big time. Not many people on FinTwit were active in the markets in 1980. I was.  Bonds were death.  Stocks were death. Gold, commodities and inflation hedges hot. Mirror image of today.

2001 2018-11-01 05:52:44 We should have let stocks and property values fall with wages, so that housing reflected people's ability to pay. But we didn't! We made sure that those that already had wealth, didn't suffer huge losses. And the result was that workers couldn't afford a roof over their heads.

2008 2018-11-01 05:49:03 At the beginning of this year I thought 7x for decent companies was cheap. Then it became 5-6x. Now it's 3-5x. I'm selling 'expensive' stocks at 6-7x to buy other stocks at 3-5x. Crazy stuff. Unless China goes Kaboom, there is gonna be some serious money made coming out of this.

2012 2018-11-01 05:46:01 Most stocks in #Asia advanced Thursday, building on a rally in global equities in the final two days of what was still their worst month in more than six years! The $GBP climbed on hopes for progress in #Brexit negotiations and the $USD weakened!
2013 2018-11-01 05:45:32 Liquidity has fallen after the correction. During the bull run everyone was chasing SME stocks and now nobody wants to buy cheap even when they are available at single digit PE.
2014 2018-11-01 05:45:29 Treasuries dipped into month-end settlement as long-end futures were heavily sold, steepening the curve; a large block trade in USZ8 contract shortly after 2pm New York time was influential, along with gains for stocks fueled by strong earnings and month-end rebalancing.
2015 2018-11-01 05:44:54 Stick to gaming and not financial advice. Stocks react to a number of financial factors and levers including speculative performance. Overall improvement of the economy helps to contribute to positive market anticipation. It's not purely temporal.

2017 2018-11-01 05:41:51 Very true John, but mining stocks can remain irrational longer than investors can remain solvent, so important to buy at deep value, hedge the buys and spread out the risks by having a diversified PF always
2018 2018-11-01 05:41:40 Yeah... they sold stocks to buy this...
2019 2018-11-01 05:38:19 Public confession: I know next to nothing about resource stocks so shouldnt invest in them and have sold most. I will keep holding PNR (gold junior) and SFX (sand explorer to be producer in a few years) however both nominal exposures.

2034 2018-11-01 05:10:57 Very true and they'll need higher interest to attract money out of stocks to service tRUmps debt.  RE will also decline due to higher rates.  All just to give tax cuts to millionaires!

2036 2018-11-01 05:08:08 The last year has proven your assertion completely false! Corporations and billionaires where given 1.5 trillion dollars with the justification that it would translate into higher wages and jobs. They took the money and bought back their stocks and wages are stagnant. Fact.
2037 2018-11-01 05:07:09 In our market 90% investor are momentum investor

And i said no media is unbiased, i picked one with less of a bias. Again fuck the bias, read the numbers and stop being so pig headed and learn something
2046 2018-11-01 04:55:41 This is not true.  Over 50% of American households own stocks, excluding exposure to embedded ownership (eg defined benefit pensions).

2061 2018-11-01 04:34:44 Consequently, with the LEGAL mods and higher quality parts, it's much easier, for those with the cash, versus competing products, to create an all but military grade weapon.

2063 2018-11-01 04:32:34 The annualized gdp is slowing down each cycle since data was recorded. Interesting note about this is how the returns from private equity are exceeding the public market by a massive margin.

2082 2018-11-01 04:17:33 I was being sarcastic, and there are many schools of thought. I went long on a few stocks, drew a vanguard index, pulled gold and silver for a few week swing.

2098 2018-11-01 04:05:48 What happens now is those buyers use the stocks as they recover to bolster their funds and post better quarterly returns. The Fed always turns up interest rates in a strong economy. Its how banks make money too. Funny part is that it isn't going up like a false inflation.

2120 2018-11-01 03:50:39 Ah yes, the thing that made stocks liquid was retail buyers and not massive surges in computerized market makers.
2121 2018-11-01 03:49:52 Marty, when you say hold do you mean just holding for a trade or long term?
I ask this because , you surely hold a lot of stocks. 

Unless you are forgetting to tell us what stocks you sell . 
2122 2018-11-01 03:49:31 So. I would venture to say if a civil war were to beak out. The tree hugging libs would show up with recyclable objects to throw while conservatives would show up with recycled tree stocks harboring US steel attachments.
2123 2018-11-01 03:47:36 I used to buy individual stocks based on whether I personally liked the product. Not how smart investing works, it turns out!

2130 2018-11-01 03:42:24 Don't focus on the stop loss. It's quality undervalued stocks. It's for the long-term Investment. There are so many upcoming political events that create uncertain volatility in the market. 
So, If you want you can invest in these stocks for the time frame of 12-18 months.

2158 2018-11-01 03:26:24 A higher mark to mkt of assets on the b/s implies a higher USD value of instruments to sell to defend the FX. Doesn't necessarily lead to overvaluation, but a high level of FX reserves (with stocks at current px) does give some sort of haven status as it shows stability

2186 2018-11-01 03:06:50 It's a smart idea while most stocks are still up substantially from where they got in and corporate buybacks are about to really ramp next 6 weeks. They sell, the company buys them back, among other things coming.
2187 2018-11-01 03:05:28 Under Obama my stocks lost money, my company had freezes on wages and bonuses, lost benefits, and saw friends and co workers lose their jobs.

2189 2018-11-01 03:02:50 Yes.  As you know, analysts on financial programs are asked to disclose whether or not they (or their firms) hold financial positions in the stocks/companies that they comment on.
Should reporters/opinion writers also disclose their party affiliation and who they voted for in

2216 2018-11-01 02:46:02 Our $BGS were only ever options (out of the money) for previous consulting.

2217 2018-11-01 02:45:54 We got Jordan Roughead for near nothing in the trade period? We had nothing the suns would be satisfied for Steven May?

2221 2018-11-01 02:44:04 Yeah that was disgusting.  That’s why we play roughly 500 bets per season.  Just stay the course with us.  Statistics function in clusters most stocks make all their yearly profits in 3 or 4 quick hit bursts per year and are otherwise stagnant.  Sports is similar.
2222 2018-11-01 02:42:53 recall he said the current correction is nothing n the bigger one coming n the first to hit is properties bcos is so sensitive then followed by stocks...?
2223 2018-11-01 02:40:29 This is why we diversify. Some years bonds are down as well as stocks. Even though calendar years are slightly arbitrary when looking out twenty, I’d bet on equities finishing positive in 2018. Not a bold call, but a call nonetheless.

2244 2018-11-01 02:22:00 Ppl w pension or 401K have stocks. If market crashes,affects everyone. Look for bank bail out or bail in. They can still do that. Bail in worse-takes your savings,checking & if deemed national emergency contents of safe deposit box
2245 2018-11-01 02:21:37 Portfolio is still up about 4%. Individual stocks have reversed to X’s. Will post some charts this weekend with buying opportunities for after mid term elections.
2246 2018-11-01 02:20:52 Did I say stocks went down.  I don’t think so!  All I’m saying is that Nike can do whatever the F*** it wants. Not a wise choice for a business, but  if they want to roll the dice that’s their choice.  If Trump supporters want to boycott Nike, it’s completely their choice too.

2248 2018-11-01 02:19:40 The stock market fluctuates bc its rich ppl playing w/money the way cats play w/mice. They've lots of money, they want more money, so stocks are manipulated to make that happen. If Dems have any influence on this it's bc the greedy wealth fear Dems bc Dems hold them accountable.
2249 2018-11-01 02:19:18 U.S. Market Check

U.S. stocks rallied for a second day to close out one of the worst months of the bull market on an upbeat note. The dollar added to a 16-month high and Treasury yields jumped.
2250 2018-11-01 02:18:56 Japanese stocks indexes dipped and equities in Australia and South Korea advanced. Futures signaled gains for equities in Hong Kong and China.
2251 2018-11-01 02:18:50 Stocks in Asia had a muted start Thursday after global equities rallied on the final two days of what was still their worst month in more than six years.
2252 2018-11-01 02:18:32 In college I bought stocks through a website called ShareBuilder. It’s been 6 years since I last logged in. Due to unclaimed property laws the assets in my account were turned over to NYS. I filed a claim. I’ll get a check in 15 days. If I get a @Tesla next month u already know!

2254 2018-11-01 02:17:04 Wait, #JacobWohl is Jewish?

But he can't even pick stocks good...
2255 2018-11-01 02:16:56 Still haven’t sold although the market, stocks, and technology sector are showing sell signals. I’m convinced this sell off is unwarranted based off irrational fear. Fear in China, political risk, etc. Once uncertainty is gone, market will recognize the strong earnings. 1/2
2256 2018-11-01 02:16:35 No, the reason the market is up is because people who have money to invest took advantage of the downturn to purchase stocks at lower prices which in turn raises the prices.
2257 2018-11-01 02:16:00 Dont let “them” tell you stocks are crazy...how my OG told me is this and keep this in mind. “The only way you lose money is if you sell for less than what you bought. You dont sell, you dont lose” be patient with the markey, it always comes back around

Pretty much no-one shoots up anyone.

2279 2018-11-01 01:55:48 It's called variance. Trading stocks is similar to poker or anything else that involves taking a calculated risk to gain an edge on the field. The day job is safe. But if u think day job isn't worth ur time, take time off, trade full time and see how u do.

2284 2018-11-01 01:49:57 The #resources sector is largely filled with optimistic yahoos who can't value #stocks and have little interest in doing so.

Record Stock Market, but those stocks are in amoral companies. 
Peace in Korea, because we're just letting Kim Jung Un get away with it now.
Rebuilding our borders... by forgetting our Statue's promise.

You've sold your soul, sir.

2369 2018-11-01 00:32:01 Stocks will do whatever the algo’s tell them to do, and they’ll like it.
2370 2018-11-01 00:30:34 how much y’all wanna bet that frosted flakes stocks went up after johnny’s costume last night (??)
2371 2018-11-01 00:30:07 When stocks are rising:

The biggest risk is to the upside. A melt-up is a real possibility here

When stocks are falling:

The biggest risk is to the downside. A crash is a real possibility here

It's almost as if the direction of the markets drives the narrative in predictions
2372 2018-11-01 00:30:04 The persistent weakness in Crude, persistent strength in the dollar had me trim just a little today related stocks. 
I am looking for a trigger led by the $AUD $NZD as key, confirmed by Crude for  EM and commodities to bottom.
Might be China stimulus, Fed policy, or both.
2373 2018-11-01 00:26:13 Goin' over it coming to a realization

2376 2018-11-01 00:24:15 “do you work” 
Yeah, I trade stocks
2377 2018-11-01 00:23:36 Sweet story brah! Apparently you don't know how to read charts then!
2378 2018-11-01 00:23:32 If stocks don't trade 24/7, then at least index ETFs could. That would be close enough.
2379 2018-11-01 00:22:19 This is flat out false!  Stocks going down is in complete concert with the tariffs, the ballooning deficit and the tax relief to only the extremely wealthy.
2380 2018-11-01 00:21:12 Why don't the top 100 U.S. stocks trade 24/7, like Bitcoin?  It's ridiculous. Market open, market close. That's 20th century stuff. Theses should trade continuously.
2381 2018-11-01 00:18:52 Nene you know we were in one of the worst recessions when Obama took office unemployment was at 9.7% & the stock market was a mess. As far as  the economy I can’t afford stocks & live modestly so it has never bothered me. Money can’t buy me happiness, but my kids & grandkids can
2382 2018-11-01 00:18:45 Who TF Stocks Up On Aeros?!? BRING OUT THAT GOOD SHIT SARA
2383 2018-11-01 00:17:54 Habilidades emocionales también!
2384 2018-11-01 00:15:59 Um thanks, but my"stocks" already went down, but it was under your administration, no the Democrats. I prefer to go back to a time when I was MAKING money.
2385 2018-11-01 00:14:23 Let’s just hope they do to Netflix what they did to the country.

You can make a lot of money selling stocks short.
2386 2018-11-01 00:13:19 By the end of the year though. This holiday season is pointing to record breaking shopping; therefore, a lot of positive results will drive those consumer spending stocks for a healthy economy.
2387 2018-11-01 00:12:22 When these questions  are asked, you are already dead but don’t know it yet. Ready? ..:Can we just be friends? And.. let’s wait for the right time before buying stocks.
2388 2018-11-01 00:12:02 I took this course at the University of Texas at Austin with my soon-to-be husband. “Family Financial Planning” affectionately known as “Piggy Bank.” How to write a check, budgeting, insurance, installment loans, credit, buying and selling stocks. Still solvent 45 yrs later

2390 2018-11-01 00:11:28 Why are they still talking about banning bump stocks? Hasn't that already happened?
2391 2018-11-01 00:10:35 If you want your stocks to soar...Make the Reds Dead on Nov. 6th !!! Go Blue !!!
2392 2018-11-01 00:10:23 @EconomicAlpha is the man for AU stocks
 Was on both $KL and $WDO early.
2393 2018-11-01 00:08:36 stocks are still high with tech they go up and down but are higher then they where 1 year ago
2394 2018-11-01 00:08:26 Understanding the stock market goes up AND down and not up OR down is important. If you can’t stomach a 10-20% drawdown in your financial portfolio you shouldn’t own stocks.
2395 2018-11-01 00:08:26 Is now not the time to mention my all-time favorite song n dance man (actor 2) grabbing prezNixon in a bear hug ... And how dude's stocks fell afterwards....
2396 2018-11-01 00:08:12 Asia equity markets begin mostly higher after the continued rebound on Wall St where month-end rebalancing, strong jobs number and Facebook earnings helped stocks recover some of the losses from its worst month in 7 years, although Nikkei 225 underperforms on strong JPY

2398 2018-11-01 00:07:43 Point is people have the ability to create signal diversity by using ensemble methods the same way they create diversity with many stocks. Why concentrate when you can be smart and diversify everywhere?
2399 2018-11-01 00:06:25 A single pull single shot weapon like any other rifle. Can be used for deer hunting, but not as accurate as either a .223 , 30/30, or even a.22. Bump stocks were designed for handicapped shooters for the AR-15, but I believe they are illegal now after Vegas.
2400 2018-11-01 00:04:45 If you support Trump and yet say you decry racism, sexism and anti-Constitutionalism, why do you support Trump? Is it because of your stocks?
2401 2018-11-01 00:04:33 But in past years the pot stocks didn’t go through an October slaughter. That old seasonal model may now be broken.
2402 2018-11-01 00:04:08 $spy so tired of hearing how october was so bad for stocks..... it was only bad for day traders fake traders and chasers all who always have bad days sooooo.... October was a beauty for investors and real traders....
2403 2018-11-01 00:00:45 Keep this thread going!  I own both UEC and Gold Mining for a few years.  I got private placement and got killed dearly in two stocks.  Amir does need to address our concerns going forward.
