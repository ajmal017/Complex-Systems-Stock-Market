39 2018-12-27 23:49:08 Beh io ho avuto questo link da un amico che ha capitolato un mese fa dopo avere comprato il top. Nel frattempo è esposto al 100% in vari Stocks/ETF.
40 2018-12-27 23:49:02 The little train that could... There's no way anyone on earth can determine how much cha ching the fed can put in this market.. Maybe they buy all the stocks with soon to be worthless FED dollars...
41 2018-12-27 23:49:00 I found a liquor store that stocks some brews from my favorite Denver Brewery @EpicBrewing! I always find these little gems on my way out of a city.
42 2018-12-27 23:48:48 So much for “law abiding gun owners” when the @NRA terrorists say they will use bump stocks even if they are illegal. NEWSFLASH: You lose your #2nd when you refuse to obey gun laws.
43 2018-12-27 23:48:46 Was looking at some but premiums are just crazy on most stocks. Haven't bought anything this week besides DT. Crazy market overall.
44 2018-12-27 23:48:35 Wikipedia 'The Great Crash of 1929' read the article and be afraid.....if you have any money tied up in the mkt...It was erratic every day before it went bust. The difference this time is that banks don't invest EVERY CUSTOMER's money in it, unless the customer buys stocks.
45 2018-12-27 23:48:23 Thoughts on cloud stocks?  CRM, ADBE, TWLO, BOX?
46 2018-12-27 23:48:18 Signed! 

I do not have nor have I ever used a bump stock, but I do see this as a “gateway ban.” Banning bump stocks only makes it easier for Big Gov to pick apart other aspects of gun builds, which could later turn into an overall gun ban. It’s asinine and unconstitutional.
47 2018-12-27 23:46:49 You sir need to have stocks in that place
48 2018-12-27 23:46:29 Hope his stocks are doing alright

51 2018-12-27 23:44:01 So do you prefer trading larger cap stocks? :-)
52 2018-12-27 23:43:54 It is the lamest shit lol. I can't learn any match ups this way lol. Then people playing 2 stocks randomly
53 2018-12-27 23:43:19 Best to diversify your investments - never leave all in one bucket.  Cash is good - so are stocks and so are bonds.  Mix it up.  Depends on how close you are to retirement too.  Individual investing!
54 2018-12-27 23:43:06 yeah but that's what lobbies are for I guess?

I wish there was a leaderboard as well but jeez it'd be a freaking mess because of how much cheese there is on elite smash.. like imagine losing your #1 spot because of a guy with 3 stocks stamina all items on ugH
55 2018-12-27 23:43:06 J'aime une vidéo @YouTube : "It's Not Just EA, Stocks for Gaming & Tech Companies are Free Falling Across the Board" à l'adresse

57 2018-12-27 23:42:47 Know people will disagree me but think it’s easier to make a case for Ja statistically than in the “eye” test. Ja grades out decently to great in FTR, 2 point %, A-TO%, Stocks. He just looks poorly from a shooting perspective and he has decent FT%. Problem of course is 1/2
58 2018-12-27 23:42:26 Iam looking for some nice dividend stocks
59 2018-12-27 23:42:18 Machines, billions from bonds to stocks? Hmmm!
60 2018-12-27 23:41:02 Invest in eye bleach stocks now.
61 2018-12-27 23:40:28 both illegal & legal kill.  You only focus on what you want.  How are you on the availability of high capacity guns & bump stocks to home grown whack jobs like Vegas, school shooters, bombers?  #NoWallEver
62 2018-12-27 23:40:01 today was a good day for my stocks thanks
63 2018-12-27 23:39:28 I had a class in stocks which included computerized trading but that was ages ago so I cannot comment on your observation. 

I remember though speed is everything in computerized trading up to and including small fractions of the speed of light.
64 2018-12-27 23:38:58 Free money for everyone !!! If they continue like this for the next week, the Dow is going to Rally till 2020, and when this program finishes in one day the stocks will drop 80% in one day
65 2018-12-27 23:38:02 Last time I'm going to tell you all that the stocks and crypto bull run of 2019 is getting ready to come to the station. Don't listen to me, that's cool. #investing #BULLISH
66 2018-12-27 23:36:39 Yeah. I also play 3 stpcks and I am fine with it as the local tournaments use 3 stock matches. The only think I do not enjoy is that almost everyone who picks 3 stocks in quick matches also picks battlefields and not fd
67 2018-12-27 23:34:41 The question is were stocks undervalued on November 9, 2016 and overvalued in October 2018 ? Seems to me investors like the middle or 50% of the range.
68 2018-12-27 23:33:49 @DayTraderPL

69 2018-12-27 23:32:38 Late-Day Surge Prevents Stocks From Entering Bear Market Territory: (Bloomberg) — Volatility… @environmentguru
70 2018-12-27 23:30:20 "Does anyone really believe the President of the USA is the main influencing factor in global stocks?". Maybe global markets were able to understand and foresee what many here couldn't. Maybe we lacked their objectivity.
71 2018-12-27 23:30:09 Do one step further... check to see that most stocks made lows in the Fall of 08’ even though indices made lows around March 09’.
72 2018-12-27 23:29:53 When i notice its on two stocks after losing one i actually turn up. Its a rarity that i don't instantly destroy my opponent at that point
73 2018-12-27 23:27:53 Also very helpful to keep track of insider disclosures.  It's no guarantee, but in the fullness of time, you ought to do well in stocks like $SOLG.L $CGP.v (with $BHP and $NCM.ax jostling for position) and $EGI (with $SAND building on an already large position).
74 2018-12-27 23:27:30 And if you keep them holding their dynamite stocks, they’re going to hate you in the very near future. It ain’t over, chief.
75 2018-12-27 23:27:16 I disagree with @Mr4thAndLong and agree with him. I agree that if you look at the franchise as a “championship franchise” or if you ever bring up the 5 rings, the only success is a ship. 

I don’t remember them. I was 3. For me, it’s like stocks. And the stock is going up IMO.
76 2018-12-27 23:27:02 But wait, I'm upset because my parents never taught me about IRA's, stocks & bonds, investments, or any other financial avenue that helps you to advance in life.
77 2018-12-27 23:26:35 I always wait for stocks I know well to diverge from their benchmarks then buy or short.  Let's say amzn down 6 hypothetically at 300 and markets down 2.5.  If upcoming catalyst or big disparity I put a big position on.  I like a 500 BPS plus disparity on no news or BS
78 2018-12-27 23:26:10 Mothers should try day trading into Forex or Stocks. They can take care of their children and earn money at the same time!
79 2018-12-27 23:25:58 @pattidomm Patti, your news articles match your last name, DOOM.  Investors need assurance that quality stocks will be solid.  Consider the tactics that cause vollitility, options, large transactions, and QE laquidity. @fedreserve1
80 2018-12-27 23:25:19 I’m finna buy some stocks
81 2018-12-27 23:24:18 $WATT Great if you're already in it and exciting to look at perhaps but to buy stocks when up 50%+ is extremely high risk. No thanks.
82 2018-12-27 23:24:16 Buying stocks with holiday money to own myself when they fail
83 2018-12-27 23:24:14 I didn’t. That said, I didn’t see such a beating of stocks at Christmas time either. I’m still expecting a good run from stocks until late Jan.
“We’ll only know when Q4 results get posted for everyone.” was my thought.
Guess I’m wrong. But wisdom can’t be tricked. Can it? #Market
84 2018-12-27 23:24:05 My perspective: crypto is 24/7 365 and default settings for the ichimoku algorithm are made for forex and stocks both not operating 24/7 365. Therefor a settings adjustment is necessary for crypto traders but you are correct, to each their own.
85 2018-12-27 23:23:41 Deadass if you wanna get me a gift, I’ll take some gift cards, some BOGO restaurant cards (chipotle and B dubs preferably), ummm and if someone could show me how to buy stocks that would be nice too
86 2018-12-27 23:23:18 Stocks looking up for the new year. 
87 2018-12-27 23:22:59 If u can't stand the heat then don't invest & trade stocks or let a pro do it for you! I've been in market since 1979 !
88 2018-12-27 23:22:49 ....sin mencionar los 245,000 pasteles con ketchup, 17,000 platos de arroz blanco con ketchup, 900mil hotdogs con ketchup, 437mil hamburgers con.......ketchup ......me deberian dar stocks en la Heinz!!!!.....
89 2018-12-27 23:22:37 Been trading for quite a while the last 3 trading days have to be the most extreme & volatile trading I have ever seen. The market at the moment is being driven on pure emotion. Panic selling followed by panic buying. 2019 is going to be good for stocks & $SLV real bad for $USD
90 2018-12-27 23:22:17 So much of gun laws and gun permits needs to be revisited and revamped. I'm not sure what the ultimate answer is, but banning bump stocks and rapid fire weapons is a good place to start. Also mental health background checks seem way more than the answer right about now
91 2018-12-27 23:22:16 Then you get what's called a sell off, and the stocks that had been climbing like crazy (which is EA, and also tons of other tech stocks) get sold first in the sell off to make the most of it. So the stock price starts dropping even though earnings trends are really good
92 2018-12-27 23:22:13 No Nerf bump stocks?
93 2018-12-27 23:21:18 Wow !  Five stocks are mentioned on Santa Gift bag... Reliance,  Infosys,  Mahindra and mahindra , United spirits and  Petronet LNG... All moved up in last two days... and good movement also expected today in these good quality stocks.... Anil Sir  You should select this photo...
94 2018-12-27 23:21:16 Oh yeah and then more recently the higher yields in the U.S. bond market make stocks in general less appealing (er, not exactly, but I'm fudging it) comparatively and so the stock market goes down essentially because other things like bonds are doing better
95 2018-12-27 23:19:51 Worth is based on assets owned, which can be house, vehicles, stocks etc. Even if you don't want direct salary increase, in a publicly traded company, you can give workers share. Which actually increases worker productivity too. They can always opt out and sell their share.
96 2018-12-27 23:19:03 Apple stock is one of the most manipulated stocks by hedge funds! It’s insane how undervalued and under appreciated it is!
97 2018-12-27 23:19:02 If you are buying stocks than you are not making enough room for everyone in the toilet!
98 2018-12-27 23:19:00 I you think FB and NFLX are going to be "key stocks" going forward, prepare to be severely disappointed.

102 2018-12-27 23:17:32 I agree, SOLD all $good.v when I checked more on the management. These stocks never get love when they distribute options 25% below market price. It is slap on retail.
103 2018-12-27 23:17:29 Turn on the news.  Records sales and stocks are up
104 2018-12-27 23:17:08 @WilfredFrost 
Market signs are leading investors to choose stocks with volatility. The green is lit. 
105 2018-12-27 23:17:00 And they will get you into all that stocks you sold on Friday. You seem nice so here is my advice take nothing on twitter for granted and trading advice without entry and exit is no advice at all ..

Ice/Propeller/Penguin Mario are all great powerups, the level design is more interesting and fun than NSMB2 (World 5 is especially great)
Still an easy ride so far, but getting the star coins is much less tedious than before thanks to powerup stocks.

115 2018-12-27 23:13:40 US stocks pull back to "normal" trading range after 1-day massive spike. This means the mass buyers yesterday are now pondering when to bail again. Of course it was the brokers ramping it to sell into any retail punter buying. Look for volatility & selloffs soon. #auspol #deadcat

117 2018-12-27 23:12:51 Stocks are back up 
118 2018-12-27 23:12:40 Hard to understand buying stocks in the 1st stages of a bear mrkt with all the hallmarks of a deep recession or depression ahead where stock prices may see a 50% haircut or more. Like corps thst did buybacks and are negative on it.
119 2018-12-27 23:12:38 Hey pro gun people, bump stocks are NOT guns. If you can't tell the difference you shouldn't own a gun
120 2018-12-27 23:12:31 Those businessmen tend to invest their money into stocks, which causes businesses to grow, which means goods and services are moved around better. I'm for people having a higher standard of living, but the difference is how we'd accomplish that.
121 2018-12-27 23:12:22 US stocks stage big rally, erase 600 point drop in Dow
122 2018-12-27 23:10:47 This is one of the reason many institutional investors stay away from many stocks. I looked at it, bought but then sold once I looked more deeply. Stock trading at 20 cents and options given at 15 cents. Slap on the face of retail shareholders.
123 2018-12-27 23:10:44 Because they are often paid not in direct cash, but in company stocks, and that can be priced billions of $$. Jeff Bazos, for example, has only 80k/annum salary, but his net worth is $200+ billion. Learn a bit of economics.
124 2018-12-27 23:10:20 US stocks stage big rally, erase 600 point drop in Dow
125 2018-12-27 23:10:00 Stocks up, swinging wildly after Wall Street's biggest day in a decade: DA ONE-PERCENTER "KOCH"-SUKKAS PLAYIN' YO-YO WITH THE "REAL" AMERICAN PEOPLE'S RETIREMENT MONEY !! THEY SHOULDA ALL TOOK IT OUT WHEN I WARNED THEM & INVESTED IT LOCALLY WHERE THESE MANGY "KOCH"-SUKKAS CAIN'T
126 2018-12-27 23:09:37 I hope they bring out the guy that was suggesting we load up on stocks at the highs, to get his opinion on what happens now

128 2018-12-27 23:08:19 if it were just self defense, why the need for  automatic, semi-automatic, bump stocks, silencers and all the other unnecessary crap the NRA is pushing?
129 2018-12-27 23:08:09 Ce ne pourrait l'être que si toute la recherche en IA-génétique s'arrêtait d'un coup,  suite à la mort planétaire d'internet, à la disparition de l'électricité et aussi du soleil, et que tous les stocks de gamètes et d'embryons décongèlent d'un coup, interdisant toute PMA/FIV 
130 2018-12-27 23:07:59 Then you misunderstand the whole point of social housing, which was to give housing security and create economically diverse communities. The reason we have people in critical need is because we've sold off our housing stocks, failed to build, and let private landlords run riot.
131 2018-12-27 23:07:33 Im buying....i could be wrong but stocks are @ 20% discount
132 2018-12-27 23:05:48 I cant express how mad i am at one stock matches in smash ultimate when doing quick play, stop it, put 3 stocks jeez.
133 2018-12-27 23:05:38 How come the Stocks went up when Trump left town, and when Trump returned to the United States, the Stocks went down again, coincidence ? ? ?
134 2018-12-27 23:05:12 He can space and steal stocks
135 2018-12-27 23:04:26 Might mean, if nothing else, they don’t have money in stocks or even have a 401k
136 2018-12-27 23:04:04 In December it's better to own detty rave tickets than invest in stocks
137 2018-12-27 23:03:49 And Trump banned bump stocks , something Obama refused to do.
138 2018-12-27 23:03:07 Parabolic Sar combined with RSI, moving averages and support/resistance. Been using it for 8 years now on stocks and crypto.
139 2018-12-27 23:03:02 Late-Day Surge Prevents Stocks From Entering Bear Market Territory
140 2018-12-27 23:02:36 Okay thanks, I understand the mechanics of it as you describe.
I do know the difference between auto & semi-auto as my husband is a disabled Vietnam Vet.
I should look for a UTube video that demonstrates. Seems as though bump stocks aren’t useful for crazy mass shooting purposes.
141 2018-12-27 23:02:14 Hey @InhofePress did you buy some stocks in time again??
142 2018-12-27 23:02:11 I am a gun owner and bump stocks are for fools.
143 2018-12-27 23:01:50 That was my first choice but Ron (the associate that was helping me) told me that Best Buy only stocks the one size in those colors. I'm not a pro yet, but I've already out grown the size. I need something between that one and the Behemoth (the pro's edition).
144 2018-12-27 23:01:36 (Vale) is very good stocks 12.99$ will be around 30.00$ in 2019
145 2018-12-27 23:00:42 Yep, that's his goal... To make stocks go down and hurt the working person lol You've lost your mind. Get your emotions in check and act like an adult.

If you want to be anti-China that's fine. But stop lying to viewers on national TV, it's a bad look.
146 2018-12-27 23:00:39 I'm sure you had a great buying opportunity a few weeks ago too on other stocks.... when prices were much higher than they are now. 
Care to show us your overall annual losses column?

I trust Warren Buffet. 
Not Trumpies.
147 2018-12-27 23:00:29 Nice more money for dividend stocks!
148 2018-12-27 22:59:39 Yesterday, stocks went up more in one day than any time since 2003.
149 2018-12-27 22:59:17 Late-Day Surge Prevents Stocks From Entering Bear Market Territory
150 2018-12-27 22:59:05 Many who came late into stocks saw quick big losses... but that’s not the way it is if you are a LT diversified investor. It’s actually profits on profits as years go by. Since 1990, indexing SP 500 has returned 10% pa. If you do Stupids of trading, big bets, chase.. you’ll lose
151 2018-12-27 22:58:40 Lmao wtf how many stocks you take homie? @RoyalSmashNY

If thats an "N/A" then hit me with with how much % you took total
152 2018-12-27 22:58:16 Risk on, buy PoS stocks and short vol?
153 2018-12-27 22:57:58 He went AFTER Christmas & only due to pressure, lied about their military salaries, slammed democrats, didn’t meet with the Iraqi prime minister... upon shutting down the government, stocks plunging, and Mattis resigning bc tRump wouldn’t listen to him about Syria
154 2018-12-27 22:57:47 Another crazy  day in the #markets #SP500 ends up 0.86% #Dow #DJIA #DowJones gained 1.14% #NASDAQ increased 0.38% #Volatility #stocks #stockmarkets #investments #investing #WallStreet #Finance #economics #economy
155 2018-12-27 22:57:34 Stocks Are Cheap, But Is a Recession Coming?
156 2018-12-27 22:57:01 Stocks are in the toilet, the government is shut down, companies are letting people go, kids are dying at the border and military is being withdrawn from areas that are known terrorist outposts… But hey we are going to have 5 billion dollar wall WE CAN PAY FOR. Happy New Year !!
157 2018-12-27 22:56:54 Wanting to make moves on portfolio as tomorrow is the last full day of trading in 2018. Do I still rely on the fact there is usually carnage in February with re-positioning of stocks w/i ETFs, mutual funds, etc or do I need to go with the hunch and buy or sell now? @jimcramer
158 2018-12-27 22:56:17 3 Cloud Stocks to Buy Right Now -  #cloud_computing
159 2018-12-27 22:55:16 Zerohedge: S&P 500 erases 2.8% drop in biggest reversal since 2010 #stocks
160 2018-12-27 22:54:49 Of course there should. But forty years of running down housing stocks is not easily reversed.
161 2018-12-27 22:54:20 $es lots of guys and gals looking at this number which means its lost its importance; EOY stuff next 1 1/2 days is likely to be WILD; fasten your seat belts; there are still 100's of overvalued stocks; ALL must break and DJT gone before there is a sustainable rally!
162 2018-12-27 22:54:12 The whole closing bell episode today was an exercise in talking people out of buying stocks...
163 2018-12-27 22:53:55 It was so nice yesterday when you weren't here...stocks were up, anxiety was down. Pity the soldiers that had to see you and hang out with you.
164 2018-12-27 22:53:38 Not sure what our plan is, TBH. The #68 still has no engine & no budget to get one. The rest of the team seems focused on the Street Stocks ATM. So you'll probably see them in that class & me in the pits pouting. 
165 2018-12-27 22:53:12 Bump stocks get banned and you classical liberals, libertarians have nothing to say (because your own “team" did it so it must not be infringing this time)
166 2018-12-27 22:51:15 Jim Cramer: Extremes Related to Stocks, Extremes Related to the Economy
167 2018-12-27 22:51:07 Oh, despair not! Trump said stocks are a bargain!
168 2018-12-27 22:50:43 More like stop making 3 minute rules with 3 stocks
169 2018-12-27 22:50:26 @SykesStudents Timothy Sykes is a lying shit.  He tells you he wins %70 of his trades and it's funny how OPTIONS are mainly set at %70 success.
He pumps you all up to buy his stock positions stocks that will inflate his ETF options that have those same stocks in then.  Fraud
170 2018-12-27 22:49:47 What does this mean for me....with no stocks/bonds....living paycheck to paycheck?
A giant load of horseshit.
171 2018-12-27 22:49:12 I bought 2 stocks and sold zero stocks this week. I love America.
172 2018-12-27 22:48:42 Stocks are cheap compared to bonds but not historical values.  Will it be different this time?
173 2018-12-27 22:48:38 I’m just playing Battlefield V, like the good ole days before I knew about pot stocks
174 2018-12-27 22:48:33 If u want to compare btc returns vs tech stocks you should use the QQQ index not the S&P 500. Then take monthly returns over the last 3 to 5 years and run a simple regression on excel and see what value of R- squared you get. Y axis s/b btc returns.
175 2018-12-27 22:47:52 That's partly the problem, but there has also been an actual fall in social housing stocks. There simply isn't enough social housing to meet need, and there is a huge incentive for private sector landlords to rack up rents and evict if people can't pay.
176 2018-12-27 22:47:01 crazy moves all over the place today, we don't trade markets we trade stocks
177 2018-12-27 22:46:46 Regumate stocks must be running low.
178 2018-12-27 22:46:45 MAYBE WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE FRAUDULENT STOCKS YOU SOLD BEFORE THE GREAT RECESSION AND HOW YOU GAVE BONUSES TO TOP OFFICIALS AFTER THE US GOVERNMENT BAILED YOU OUT
179 2018-12-27 22:46:31 What year was it that stocks traded on fundamental values? Pre-tech boom of  the 90’s?
180 2018-12-27 22:46:30 Yesterday - Industry: #SOFTWARE & SERVICES was 16% Positive, with #DIVERSIFIED FINANCIALS 1% Positive. Stocks: $AVL was 18% Positive, with $SPX -1% Negative. #ASX
181 2018-12-27 22:45:13 Yesterday's top 10's: $SPX, $RHT, $DNA, $PLS, $DOW, $ASX, $CHK, $AVL, $AVZ, $WHK, and #ELLIOTTWAVE, #TRADING, #ASX, #AUSBIZ, #STOCKS, #FOREX, #GOLD, #LITHIUM, #MARKET, #DOW
182 2018-12-27 22:45:09 If you actually want to know what I want...I would like my personal stocks to rise through the roof...I am not rooting for a fall.
183 2018-12-27 22:44:40 The elderly should never have a large portion in stocks unless the money is "long term" money for heirs or 10+ year time horizon.  Money you need to take out should be in fixed income.  This is basic asset allocation.
184 2018-12-27 22:44:25 3 stocks 3 min LUL
185 2018-12-27 22:43:58 Income statement divided Treasury stocks bonds
186 2018-12-27 22:43:36 So? What does that report even mean? Is it just entertainment?  Stocks went down then up?Wow. People are invested with their real money and @CNBC acts as though they are a reality tv show.  I bet you check your ratings every hour based on the % change in the spy. It’s strange.
187 2018-12-27 22:42:24 Chasing something extra special for your New Years Eve? The Commercial Club Bottle Shop has you covered.

188 2018-12-27 22:42:08 I’m honestly not very pleased with trump either. He isn’t following on his promises and he needs to stop ranting on Twitter. And he banned bump stocks.
189 2018-12-27 22:41:59 Stocks rally hard 100% of the time immediately after I take a hard fall down the stairs.  

Fact.  Painful fact.
190 2018-12-27 22:41:49 @Gfilche @HyperChangeTV Are there any cannabis companies/stocks you’re keeping an eye on? Do you think the industry has leveled out a little going into 2019? Likewise, thoughts on the hemp industry growth w/ new legislation? #cannabis #hemp
191 2018-12-27 22:41:45 And that’s also fine. Equity momentum algos might be awesome. But selling fundamental quality growth style until stocks fall and then switching to equity momentum algo on the basis that this is actually a fundamental call. Not yet convinced.
192 2018-12-27 22:41:43 US officials says sharp recovery of stock prices on Boxing Day was due to $100bn of end-of-year pension fund re-balancing after stocks dived steeply (funds buying stocks to maintain preplanned ratios of asset types by value).

That would suggest the recovery is superficial.
193 2018-12-27 22:41:36 Agree - big reason why I became an EOD trader years ago. Cheering your stocks on from the sidelines doesn’t work, & watching every tick does your head in. I know - I’ve been there. It’s bad psychology and only leads to discipline issues. Especially in relation to risk management.
194 2018-12-27 22:41:10 Oh puhhllease! Get a life. Economy strong despite stocks, very low unemployment, 2 mil NEW jobs created, no trade wars, New NAFTA deal,Govt shutdown Democrat fault, dollar NOT crashing. Stop lying!
195 2018-12-27 22:40:29 Agree about tax advantages (which ofc differ per country). Disagree about fluctuations. For someone e.g. saving for a down payment on a house in ~10 years, most rules of thumb advise some amount of stocks. E.g. Tim Hale advises ~40% stocks in above situation.
196 2018-12-27 22:39:56 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
197 2018-12-27 22:39:05 I get it to a certain degree. If you’re a nerd who knows his pop culture and has a good idea of the longevity of different franchises and the significance of specific merchandise lines then it’s a safer investment than stocks b/c there will never be any more originals, only less.
198 2018-12-27 22:39:01 And - as a theory - sunspots are really interesting, and apparent. I think everyone looking at credit will get this. I just haven’t quite been sold as to why this isn’t an argument to buy an equity momentum also when it comes to stocks.
199 2018-12-27 22:38:35 Market in the dump stocks worth shit and people losing their homes. HARP, Home Affordable Relief Program, which helped home owners stay in their homes.
200 2018-12-27 22:38:25 C'mon, you can live without bump stocks.
201 2018-12-27 22:38:15 1) election night wasn’t coming off a downtrend. Stocks were in a massive uptrend at that point. 2) I never said there had to be a retest. But in my estimation based on the weight of the evidence, one is most likely in this particular case.
202 2018-12-27 22:38:05 Facts are facts, and if you can’t deal with reality because you have stocks in petroleum, that’s your problem
203 2018-12-27 22:38:03 Why do I think today's action is likely a short squeeze bear trap?  Both stocks and bonds ended the day strongly higher.  This is not the action I would expect for a short-term bottom.  Bonds should sell off coming off a stock bottom.  Unless bonds sell off tomorrow, watch out.
204 2018-12-27 22:37:27 @AdamHGrimes I want to trade us stocks. Come from a background in FX and commodities. I  swing trade consolidation patterns on 4H and daily charts. I need to look for indexes and earnings session? Anything else or I can trade the same as FX? Thanks
205 2018-12-27 22:36:53 wow Rafi basically says if liberals win another term that the energy sector in canadian energy stocks are basically not worth investing in
206 2018-12-27 22:36:51 Crypto traders jumped into stocks. Theres nothing like stock traders to eneter crypto anymore. Things have changes
207 2018-12-27 22:36:44 Folks saying you’ve gotta sell stocks after they’ve fallen because tightening FCIs (caused by lower stocks) will lead to recession, which will hurt stocks.
208 2018-12-27 22:35:41 @David_Kudla Well, I guess we just hit The Bottom.
We should probably buy up as many pot stocks, scooter rental startups and whatever else we want now.
209 2018-12-27 22:35:31 I have friends who invest in stocks and one who works for an investment company. They say leave it
210 2018-12-27 22:35:01 Not so sure. Many stocks have been slaughtered and are pricing in a severe recession. What makes you think that is in the cards?
211 2018-12-27 22:34:59 Need to become the CEO of Disney & change Mickey's first name to Monkey so the company's stocks plummet
212 2018-12-27 22:34:11 Thinking about stocks in store, I had a young chuckle earlier when I took notice that the triple order made of Cruz Watermelon went through & Distell delivered.

The chuckle happened coz we discontinued Ciroc at store level. Plus all there's the magapu commotion going on .. Yah

219 2018-12-27 22:32:56 So how many crimes have bump stocks been used in?  How do you know that all bump stocks were turned in?  How are you going to reimburse said owners for the cost of the bump stocks?  Are you aware that a belt or a rubber band can do the same thing as a "bump stock"?
220 2018-12-27 22:31:27 Can I get 3 stocks please
221 2018-12-27 22:31:23 What are stocks? All I know is crypto

227 2018-12-27 22:28:52 So many declaring that was the bottom now.  I don't know.  Stocks in general do not seem like a huge bargain based on forecasts for next year. What to do.
228 2018-12-27 22:27:36 I know you don’t really track oil related stocks but I would like to have your chart analysis and opinion on the ticker $CIM if possible. Would greatly appreciate it!
229 2018-12-27 22:27:23 and Blizzard becomes the laughing stock of the gaming industry as they fruitlessly try to moderate and silence people who they deem "Toxic."  There's a reason why EA and Activision-Blizzard's stocks dropped exponentially more than the other game companies this year.

231 2018-12-27 22:26:42 US stocks have roared back to finish the day in positive territory, following steep losses earlier, as equities rebounded for a second day. The Dow Jones rose 1.14% & the Nasdaq gained 0.38%. Ahead of the local open SPI futures are flat at 5,553. #ausshares #stockmarket

233 2018-12-27 22:24:34 Stocks rallied in the final hours of trade on Thursday, turning a 600+ point  loss in the Dow Jones Industrial Average into a 260 point gain as bargain  hunters poured into risk assets late in the day
234 2018-12-27 22:24:33 I’ve heard that for over 6-months, as the stock continues to get cheaper and cheaper. I much prefer stocks get more expensive after I buy them.

245 2018-12-27 22:17:47 Guns, bump stocks, you name it. You actually need the link? Dude, forget for a moment, that you sound like Mini Mouse... you're not the sarpest knife in the drawer, are you?

247 2018-12-27 22:17:27 He used QE to provide helicopter cash to corporations who used said cheap cash to finance stock buybacks (a scam legalized by Reagan btw). He created a legalized pump and dump fueled by stocks bought on credit,  adding nothing to the productive economy. Hence jobless recovery.
248 2018-12-27 22:16:09 The next @jimcramer better have his or her head wrapped around new techniques for working people to save up for retirement. We now realize stocks/funds in IRA's and 401k's are not viable - uncontrollable by the under 10%. It's a sad place - maybe group real estate? #Change
249 2018-12-27 22:15:58 I've gotten to trading one stocks options only. For past 30 days. Makes things easier. Find one with good Beta, ATR, reasonable premiums and liquidity. It's good daily money. Small guys cash cow.
250 2018-12-27 22:15:43 Can $V and $MA be seen as defensive stocks given 1) no credit risk and 2) people use plastic in good and bad times. If so...why did they get hit with the rest of the market? Thx @MelissaLeeCNBC

253 2018-12-27 22:14:36 Retail worker: just stocks shelves/serves on tills. Not always, even in large stores they are expected to know the inventory, restock, change the layout, tidy up after members of the public, find items for customers, check and process refunds and exchanges (1/2)
254 2018-12-27 22:14:21 Nate. Your political observations suckkkkkkk

Sorry. 
Go back to sports stats or hedging stocks.

256 2018-12-27 22:13:44 I've tried 3 stock omega with 7 mins and it seems pretty consistent so far. Sometimes I get 2 stocks or Battlefield and on one occasion I got a normal stage with items but it has been fine for me overall

290 2018-12-27 22:00:40 One reason why stock markets are doing better in last two sessions is that fund managers always try to dress up their year-end balance sheets with big name stocks, many of which they sold a month or two before.

305 2018-12-27 21:56:35 Stocks closed higher on Thursday, adding to the massive gains from the previous session, after a strong surge in the final hours of trading.

The Dow finishes the day up 260 points.
306 2018-12-27 21:56:12 This is quite a reversal of sentiment. For the past several weeks, the sellers ruled the closing hours of the market. I think we've already seen the low of the correction (or bear market for small caps)! I think at least the first half of 2019 will be VERY positive for stocks!

335 2018-12-27 21:48:30 It managed to squeak out a slight increase but that's not saying much considering this is the time period in which the stock market typically rises considerably. Always buy stocks before Christmas because its almost always guaranteed to make you money. (Well .. maybe not this yr)

343 2018-12-27 21:45:49 Oversimplification. Shouldnt jump to the obvious conclusion. Many of the stocks were traded/owned by Lou Simpson at Geico (reported by BRK) and BRK has been active in merger arb at times. #20 refers to a deliberative mindset, not an absolute #.

375 2018-12-27 21:35:26 I've shorted stocks twice in my life ('99-'02 and '05-'09) simply to neutralize another long position. If I did short routinely, I would be a smudge mark. Roadkill. Toe-tagged.
376 2018-12-27 21:35:21 doesn't matter what or who is causing the move.  what matter is the market internals.  these move are not due to moving a few stocks.

393 2018-12-27 21:30:56 Anybody doubt Trump & Mnuchin had a pretty good idea any massive drop in stocks would present a HUGE buying opportunity for their wealthy buddies?

I don't. 

What about you: @DrDinD @MelissaJPeltier @Jodi______ ?
394 2018-12-27 21:30:54 I'll post this for you .. In case you missed it !! "U.S. stocks stage strong late-afternoon rally, closing with gains after erasing a 600-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Dow ends up 258 points."
395 2018-12-27 21:30:51 2019 I’m going to invest in stocks and secure the bag for myself long term.
396 2018-12-27 21:30:29 Lot of volatility. Still a good chance to buy stocks for cheap imo
397 2018-12-27 21:30:26 @TripleDTrader After the close today almost all stock charts look exactly the same, it feels like one investor buying and selling the same stocks at the same exact time !!!
398 2018-12-27 21:29:56 I think, not sure but think, that is because the 2 & 20 liquidations which is what I think is causing all this is mostly an American phenomena heavily over weighted to U.S. stocks.  2/2
399 2018-12-27 21:29:21 No one stocks it because it's so expensive. This is SO GREAT.
400 2018-12-27 21:28:37 Finding stocks that skyrocked before closing, and feeling like a financial genius while I rake in my monies #IfOnlyIWere
401 2018-12-27 21:28:25 If you didn't buy stocks at the 'bottom' choose a reason why
402 2018-12-27 21:28:18 I thought you were bullish on stocks?
403 2018-12-27 21:28:00 Only Democrats were short stocks at the close
404 2018-12-27 21:27:50 yahoo cannot wait to gloat over this even though by the end of the day stocks recovered and ended UP 250. Bias is poison.
405 2018-12-27 21:27:47 Yes Joe been watching..from my perspective if that were to go to parity with $..I’d be looking looking to move funds back to UK ..and also buy UK stocks..amazing reserve opp back when it was 2/1 $/£
406 2018-12-27 21:27:16 I've been thinking about getting into investing in stocks, but damn there is a lot to learn
407 2018-12-27 21:26:50 Am I missing something? Investing only makes sense if it’s something you see taking off or an industry that’s building. I love Apple but I’m not buying stocks in them because why?

412 2018-12-27 21:24:34 Looks like you picked the wrong week to ban bump stocks
413 2018-12-27 21:24:31 Short sellers still jumping back in the market for bargains. Short selling stocks should have neen outlawed years ago.

417 2018-12-27 21:23:51 Agreed. Everyone should be worried about the relatively volatility of the market these days. Lot's of blowback on folks, whether or not you own stocks. It's messing with folk's investment and retirement.
418 2018-12-27 21:23:50 Extreme market volatility IS negative and is shaking investor confidence.  Stocks do NOT have these wild swings in healthy normal econony we ARE in turmoil and need stability
419 2018-12-27 21:23:30 Come on, nothing to do with Trump, stocks are much to high in a country with so many debt. The American Dream is over

426 2018-12-27 21:22:00 It was always imaginary, fueled by public funding via low interest rate and tax cuts. There's absolute no underlying growth to support these over-valued stocks.

433 2018-12-27 21:20:49 That is false. Just like drugs, guns czn be bought on the black market, or people can just make their own. Further, there are millions in 4 states who are now IGNORING state bans on "high capacity" magazine and bump stocks. Just like Australia, these bans are not working.
434 2018-12-27 21:20:47 “Value” ETFs are the biggest ETF failure next to XIV. Vanguard is getting paid FREE money to slap 200 stocks with P/Es below 15 into a fund. These aren’t “value” stocks - they’re value traps and simply shitty companies. Since when does a “value” etf have a beta >1?

439 2018-12-27 21:19:40 I'm getting the sense that these face ripper EOD rallys are year end re-balancing. You can see the "buy stocks, sell bonds" trade explode at about 2:30 est the last 2 days. It wouldn't surprise me to see it go another 2 days. That would set up for a vicious Jan selloff though.

445 2018-12-27 21:18:19 Wild Price Action. Stocks Are Still a Good-Bye, NOT BUY. I recall similar vicious "Rip-Your-Faceoff" Bear Market Rallies From The '80s, '90s and 2008. My View: We have NOT bottomed and This volatility is NOT BULLISH!
446 2018-12-27 21:18:10 Wild day on Wall Street!  Stocks tanked early, then soared to close well higher on the day, with huge overall ranges. 

No matter what markets do, abundant evidence of robust underlying growth, buoyed by pro-growth policies and a surge in Consumer & Business optimism.
447 2018-12-27 21:17:52 Held key support and investment advisors are actually recommending shorting stocks which is a great contrary indicator. Felt like a bottom yesterday and we tested 50% of that move today.  Great day.

524 2018-12-27 21:02:52 NEW YORK (AP) — US stocks stage furious late-day rally to close with gains, erasing 600-point drop in Dow Jones Industrial Average.
525 2018-12-27 21:02:31 Finally out my long positions on #US30 after adding additional buy orders at 21,669 and 22,580.

Although not a perfect trade, great risk management got me out with a good profit.

529 2018-12-27 21:01:54 Stocks went up nearly 100 pts in 30 seconds at the close. Ya it’s bullshit. Stocks are controlled by nothing.
530 2018-12-27 21:01:38 I was thinking this myself. I wanted to sell some stocks right after the election.

532 2018-12-27 21:01:14 That is insanity. Everyone involved should be put in the stocks in the town square.

540 2018-12-27 20:59:58 I’ll steer Allie into stocks. She’s already saving up for her first home. 

My stock advise is so simple is sounds stupid - buy stocks. When stocks go down, buy more stocks. When they crash, buy like crazy. 

When I say stocks, I mean mostly indexes and only...

546 2018-12-27 20:57:38 A pet peeve of mine is people taking the DJIA as "the market" without understanding what it is - or how in recent years the Dow has taken to swapping out underperforming stocks for overperforming ones to keep it going up.

551 2018-12-27 20:56:54 No retail investors should be in stocks after the last two days. Two moves that violent with ZERO major news one way or the other should clearly demonstrate algos are totally in control and can - and will - move that violently in the other direction.
552 2018-12-27 20:56:51 Out of bonds into stocks? Hmmm, time for homework!
553 2018-12-27 20:56:44 I think they would lose much more if they did not buy back their stocks.

591 2018-12-27 20:45:55 The only way to be sure about whats happening you have to look at all major asset class - investors were and still are extremely overweight US equities so the move in stocks dictates the rest

596 2018-12-27 20:43:38 I agree... I’m still cautious and think we test the lows through late Jan (next time Fed meets). But there is a ton of value in stocks right now... with no recession in sight.
597 2018-12-27 20:43:37 Ya funny when it was down my pot stocks where up now Dow green pot stocks went down
598 2018-12-27 20:43:34 Exactly, and some have suggested that low-risk stocks or bonds could have netted him the billion dollars he has now from his original wealth.  Which, from what I've seen, if it was that simple, everyone with $50 million automatically would become a billionaire by default.
599 2018-12-27 20:42:56 Mr president when most companies own 80% or 90% of their own stock, they will be immune from external influence !if most withdraw from stock  to not sell anymore stocks, the MARKETS will Collapse and a domino effect worldwide! That's what happened in 1929!

641 2018-12-27 20:30:24 If Stocks close in positive territory, that would be pretty darn bullish after being down 600+ points earlier today.

645 2018-12-27 20:29:46 A few more days for people to take their "strategic" losses, then what??? So many stocks have been sold relentlessly for weeks- just need a brief respite which would be a big change of pace w/ now very low expectations...

648 2018-12-27 20:28:33 I prefer fundamental analysis to technical. The economy is showing sighns of growth @ 3% GDP. I don't think there is debt overhang risk. There are corporates that are cash rich & have strong balance sheets. I prefer those. Plus higher rates will help financial stocks

They sell a bunch then buy it again after it’s low to make more money. It’s a joke. Stocks should just be based on how a company is doing.

672 2018-12-27 20:17:19 Lions. Stocks cut losses in half, DJIA down 250. This is EXACTLY what we want to see. If stocks end flat then hold for 2-3 trading days THAT to me will look like the right time to short UNLESS some kind of REAL China deal is made. Lets see how this plays out.

674 2018-12-27 20:16:55 Yup. I've watched gun-guy YouTube channels talk about bump stocks. Before Vegas, they called them a goofy, dumb novelty. After Vegas, they talk about the fate of bump stocks being the fate of the Republic.

679 2018-12-27 20:14:06 Stocks dropped sharply Thursday morning as the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 500 points one day after a historic rally

The Dow, Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were down roughly 2 percent by
680 2018-12-27 20:14:00 10:25 a.m. Thursday, a day after stocks surged to erase record losses.

The Dow gained a record-high 1,086 points Wednesday and the S&P rose 5 percent to escape from a bear market.

689 2018-12-27 20:11:16 #trade US stocks open lower as investors look to lock in post-rally gains

Investors sought to lock in profits from yesterday's historic rally and were concerned that President Trump was escalating a trade war with China. Investors grew jittery about the escalating trade war…
690 2018-12-27 20:11:01 “what makes stocks valuable in the long run isn’t the market. It’s the profitability of the shares in the companies you own. Corporations become more valuable and sooner or later, their shares will sell for a higher price.”  - Peter Lynch
691 2018-12-27 20:10:25 After a 5000 point drop in the DOW, a 20% drop, an official Bear market, President Trump recommends a "buy." So he wants the Middle Class to buy stocks in an official Bear market while bashing the Fed. Chair...awesome. Why no "sell" recommendation 5K points ago? @realDonaldTrump

695 2018-12-27 20:08:21 I think most of the videos are gonna cover Blizzard's drop in stocks. I understand banning people if they misbehave at your shop, but requiring people to have never said anything controversial or offensive ever anywhere, is too much.
696 2018-12-27 20:07:33 The Stocks are falling once again, @realDonaldTrump. Tweet something. Fast.

701 2018-12-27 20:05:22 Well, Stocks are Crashing, and BTC Already Crashed, by the looks of it BTC will begin to recover much faster which then makes them inversely correlated on the short term and potentially trigger MORE stock Selling and Buying BTC

703 2018-12-27 20:04:14 I don’t see any correlation. And i think  #btc crashed before the S&P500. If, next year, 1% of stocks market cap come into crypto market, the pump will be huge.

706 2018-12-27 20:02:47 Once again, slippery-slope is not a cogent argument. Who cares what branch ATF falls under, zero evidence they are coming for guns and ‘other attachments’. Point-blank, bump-stocks are useless for hunting and a danger to society. That was a good decision to ban them.
707 2018-12-27 20:02:17 That should only be for timed though.  Taking multiple stocks sort of defeats the point of stock matches.  =/
708 2018-12-27 20:02:12 As #WarrenBuffett wrote in his 2016 letter to shareholders, investors should do two things when stocks are falling: stay in the market and buy at a bargain.

710 2018-12-27 20:01:25 That's true:  But if a Algo has instructions to "sell all high growth stocks when SPX falls >1% intraday" and those are its marching orders, it can magnify the move while humans are also selling because it doesn't use judgement on the instrux

729 2018-12-27 19:56:28 Nope, the stocks are ok. People usually put their money in stocks at the start of they year and then collect their profit at the end. It’s been like this in 2015, 2016, 2017 too. Stocks will rise January and drop again in December next year. It’s called apull out, not a crash.

736 2018-12-27 19:53:38 13 % increase on this news is complete manipulation, feel this is being held back if today’s news was negative -70%  but on a great piece of news +13% ?? is complete nonsense. held stocks that have done 200% on similar news before now.
737 2018-12-27 19:53:03 S&P Futures Tumble As Epic  Fizzles
 
On any other day, a 1.5% drop in the S&P futures would be cause for alarm;  after yesterday's historic 5% surge in US stocks it barely prompts a shrug,  even with ES sliding -36 points, it is roughly where it was trading at 3:35pm yesterday.

783 2018-12-27 19:38:31 Yet oddly the equity market narrative remains that an overly aggressive @federalreserve is somehow to blame - we may get more hikes if stocks bounce and inflation picks up, but otherwise it will be earnings and/or economic weakness that justify these equity moves
784 2018-12-27 19:38:21 meant to ask you @howardlindzon about those sector spiders from S&P.  like #XLK for tech. close to your idea of the S&P 495.  to stop putting money into the stocks of companies that suck. 
are they worth a damn?
785 2018-12-27 19:38:18 My IRA is doing just fine thank you... Stay away from the volatile tech stocks. Only buy stocks that pay a decent dividend. Even if the price goes down, I still enjoy my 6. 8% returns from BP and ATT dividends. When the price drops...just buy more. Your welcome.
786 2018-12-27 19:38:16 I don't think that's any *smart* bull's thesis. People like @andr3w321 know stocks are overvalued, but also believe banks and institutions have nowhere else to stash cash rn. It's basically whether you believe the recession will happen now or in a year or two or three.

788 2018-12-27 19:37:23 Short sellers and people who are "bearish" are selling their stocks because of what the media keeps saying when they aren't paying attention to the actual credible investors who are buying stocks at these low prices caused by the fed.
789 2018-12-27 19:37:15 Sis: 
2008 she "I should diversify into commodities"
2009: Asked her to sell all & buy QQQ at 37 & Forget, sold at 43.

790 2018-12-27 19:37:13 LMAO are you kidding me? and the graphs showing how the Feds interest rate hikes went up the stocks started going down. Lets blame The President for signing MAGA hats for all the stock markets., not counting Japan. The picture I seen only showed 3 soldiers holding maga hats.
791 2018-12-27 19:37:03 Amul was given 300 cr subsidy, Karnataka govt is giving 5 RS per litre subsidy to govt coop. From where is this money coming? Tax payers? All coz of mis management. Maharashtra govt gave 50rs per kg subsidy on milk powder stocks. Y this situation rose?
792 2018-12-27 19:36:57 yooo stocks are crazy
793 2018-12-27 19:36:45 Japan is going to resume commercial whaling because stocks have recovered enough to do so. Yes, thanks to the U.S. and other countries who have had a moratorium for years on whaling. What gives japan the right to reap the rewards created by other countries abstentions?
794 2018-12-27 19:36:43 stocks worth to look at are :

798 2018-12-27 19:35:18 What are you talking about? Stocks overall have been rising since he got into office. But yeah everything is Trump, ofc. Always that one idiot in every thread that needs to mention Trump, no matter what subject. He's the president and thank God for it. Here's some tissue, baby.
799 2018-12-27 19:34:52 ntuc really should take stocks for Fiji 1.5l bottles cus I'm tired of having to waste plastic bottles
800 2018-12-27 19:34:34 When it comes to stocks, it’s about the trend and not a single day result. As you can see, today is a different day
801 2018-12-27 19:34:10 They retracted the update after like 11 minutes because it was so bad that their stocks crashed
802 2018-12-27 19:34:08 But even if someone is needy enough for social housing, they still often don't get it for months or even years, because councils just don't have the stocks. Forty years of running down social housing stocks has taken its toll.
803 2018-12-27 19:33:55 marijuana stocks being tainted with same brush as legitimate companies with operations and actual revenues and sales....managements still hoping to put "hopium sheen" on operations

805 2018-12-27 19:32:59 All 505 stocks in the $VIX are green
806 2018-12-27 19:32:39 Remind me again, how many of the S&P500 stocks are in the green...? 
807 2018-12-27 19:32:32 Wake up? Now why would I want to do that? My stocks are doing great, my 401k is great, my pay went up, the job market I’m in is booming with amazing futures. My family is doing amazing. Everything is going pretty dang well for me right now. Idk if I want to wake up. #GoodLife
808 2018-12-27 19:32:28 Please can you get the SEC to restrict the short selling of stocks.
Similar to 2008, the markets are currently dictated by short sellers.
809 2018-12-27 19:32:28 The stock market "system" is currently in a chaotic state. Trading has become an isolated system of its own with tenuous connections to the performance of the companies underlying the stocks themselves.
810 2018-12-27 19:31:28 All $SPX stocks are red at the moment.
811 2018-12-27 19:31:17 imagine actually believing stocks are no longer overvalued
812 2018-12-27 19:31:05 Don’t tell me this is the wrong time to finally invest in stocks...
813 2018-12-27 19:30:20 Once 45 is indicted, can we put a lien against any and all properties, cash and/or stocks that can be liquidated that he and his family have?
814 2018-12-27 19:30:09 DOW is down a couple hundred points for week even after yesterday's  record 1,000 point rally  It's down 575 points today.  With trump in office, I believe market will continue to be crazy.  My retirement  funds are out of stocks & in short-term treasuries (Stable Value Funds)
815 2018-12-27 19:29:46 I generally just try to play the game I know (bank stocks), and don't trade oil, but up 10% yesterday, down 6% today in the worlds largest energy source is messed up.

Is that a healthy thing for market structure? Asking for a friend.
816 2018-12-27 19:29:09 I loved bitty baby growing up  best baby dolls ever!!!
817 2018-12-27 19:29:08 DOW is down a couple hundred points for week even after yesterday's record 1,000 point rally  It's down 575 points today.  With trump in office, I believe the market will continue to be crazy.  My retirement funds are out of stocks & in short-term treasuries (Stable Value Funds)
818 2018-12-27 19:28:51 Maybe. But the true correlation is his trade tariffs and a treasury secretary calling the big banks asking about their liquidity are more contributing factors. Add corporate tax cuts that were used to buy back stocks instead of cap ex and you have an uncertain market.
819 2018-12-27 19:28:36 We focus on clean and simple patterns. Think of the basing pattern as a launch pad. We need a SOLID launch pad for a good liftoff. P.S. No solid launch pads here!!  #stocks
820 2018-12-27 19:28:25 Then you are a fool. People buying stocks made the market go up not algorithms.  People selling make the markets go down not algorithms.
821 2018-12-27 19:28:13 before I place an order for next week will you have sufficient stocks or shall I just cancel my delivery pass and shop elsewhere?
822 2018-12-27 19:28:02 Now its time to see which stocks dems bought
823 2018-12-27 19:27:01 I am trying to understand about bump stocks. What’s the truth and what’s the propaganda.
824 2018-12-27 19:26:59 Hey @NaviAvatar1 do the stocks still have to confirm? Why aren’t the banks calling and confirming today?
825 2018-12-27 19:26:46 Real question.. are #biotech stocks allow by law to go green more then 1 day in a row. Asking for my biotech analyst friend that works for Citi.
826 2018-12-27 19:26:03 Only 5 of the S&P500's 505 stocks are green
827 2018-12-27 19:25:41 Given Christmas Eve and today’s melt downs, does that make yesterday even more crazy?  Did people get cash under the tree and immediately start buying stocks?  Now back to our regularly scheduled bear market...
828 2018-12-27 19:25:25 Exxon is paying 5% and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.  Starting next month, OPEC is cutting supply (in theory).  I don’t know about tobacco. I only own a small stake in PMI, so I don’t follow it closely.  And honestly, I mostly look for growth stocks...not retiring soon
829 2018-12-27 19:25:11 Les prochaines élections européennes auront lieu le 26 mai 2019, les #politiques vont sortir leurs stocks de pommade, avec le mécontentement des #GiletsJaunes beaucoup espérent gagner des points. Les charmeurs de serpents aiguisent leurs flutes.

832 2018-12-27 19:24:21 Good info. Approach / calls are systematic based on data. Algos are taking stocks down to log scale TL. MU log scale TL is $23 sh. Level is not going to hold.

835 2018-12-27 19:23:54 That is the burn and Bain of people who try to better themselves. A simple raise or 2nd job kicks you up into a higher tax bracket= more taxes. Some folks buy stocks to use as a write off.
836 2018-12-27 19:23:47 Yesterday was bargain hunting by traders who had Christmas Day to convince themselves some stocks were undervalued. But the overall trend is clear. Markets loathe instability, and that's Trump's middle name.
837 2018-12-27 19:23:43 OK. Think about. If you loose, the ban could legally be expanded to other accessories or guns due to your "definitions". Those that use bump stocks only admit that they can't aim - can't hit a target without it. Good Luck. I wouldn't want you to talk yourself out of a right.
838 2018-12-27 19:23:33 we live in an era where chicks be asking for or satisfied with shoes and bags......

i’ll take investments such as property, stocks, and equity for $500 Alex
839 2018-12-27 19:23:22 yeah but what is the point of including every single stocks to one index?. This is history and how people before us already figured out its necessary. you end up categorizing the companies by their size and industry to evaluate them.
840 2018-12-27 19:23:20 Hi! It's funny but I don't think Fed's gonna roll over n die without a fight. That said, I think stocks setting up for rally into the next FOMC mtg in late January. They need the market in rally mode to continue their rate hike game. Betcha we'll see wild swings  but yet
841 2018-12-27 19:23:09 @POTUS @RealDonaldTrump @Senate @Congress @GOP @RNC @DNC ...Today, Stocks Down Again! Down 590 POINTS!

843 2018-12-27 19:21:55 They have integrity. Notice how stocks were shit-canning until he was out of the country one day? With him gone it did well the one day. Today he is back and it is down -606 points again, just so far by 2 PM.. It says it all. His presence slone drops stock values.
844 2018-12-27 19:21:48 You don’t invest in stocks? Boy get on that

860 2018-12-27 19:17:53 You can't just wave a magic wand and conjure up the quantities of social housing that are needed. It will take years to rebuild the stocks. And in the meantime we have a housing crisis.

863 2018-12-27 19:17:28 Bump stocks are not a problem that really required attention.
864 2018-12-27 19:17:04 Largest gain for 1 day after tanking, THE MOST EVER, on the 24th and the rest of Dec. everything down again today.  Lots of winning going on here. Nice thing the Canadian Stocks are surging upwards.

866 2018-12-27 19:16:33 Food for thought - Did stocks tumble today because Fed Chairman Powell is safe?  Or maybe because majority of professional traders are vacationing until after the New Year?
867 2018-12-27 19:16:28 I am discussing the reality of where we are with social housing. There is NOT ENOUGH TO MEET NEED. While that remains the case - which it will for many years because stocks are so low - we cannot afford the luxury of social housing for better-off people.

869 2018-12-27 19:14:35 The wealthy stay wealthy by moving wealth around. IMHO it’s not a spin on crypto but a matter of simple economics and pure logic. If the US dollar can no longer contain their wealth, they need to move it elsewhere. The intrinsic value of the $ or stocks you see today is not real!
870 2018-12-27 19:13:52 Of course. It takes a while to get to zero. Then we can explore letting stocks go negative, that would open up much more room to fall.
871 2018-12-27 19:13:51 Tech stocks getting weak again. Got some puts on $FB and $AAPL all expiring tomorrow. Let's wait and see.

877 2018-12-27 19:11:16 The bounce from yesterday was due to 200 weekly Moving Avg (weekly chart) for dow & ES.  I do not follow any indicator but general crowd does.

890 2018-12-27 19:07:50 Minorities need to invest in each other, in our communities, in our youth. Build wealth. Fuck cars, clothes, jays and jewels. Im talking LLCs, stocks, IRAs and real estate.
891 2018-12-27 19:07:41 Stocks have headed back to the wood shed for another beating. Use your December quarterly statement to get a nice fire going in the fireplace. Sit back and enjoy IU, Michigan, Mich St. and Ohio St. battle for a Big 10 title.  
892 2018-12-27 19:06:40 Of course the multi-millionaire crowd is likely viewing things different.  The stock market tanking benefits them.  While you and me are worrying about our 401(k) or 403(b), they get to snap up stocks cheaply and liquidate them later once the market rebounds.
893 2018-12-27 19:05:48 Stocks are extremely volatile...rallied 1,000 point yesterday, down 550 today.   I'm standing aside.  Too much uncertainty with trump's government shutdown, trade wars, undermining our allies.

896 2018-12-27 19:05:31 Try reading what I wrote instead of strawmanning. I'm not asking for official policy - I'm suggesting that individuals with a relatively high income should consider, on a personal basis,  private housing to help improve stocks of social housing for those who actually need it.
897 2018-12-27 19:05:14 EA's stocks are dropping because of EA's actions just like Act's is due to Act's. Tech going down is not the main reason for their fall. To try to attribute their loss to just that is trying to take credit away from the source. Us gamers speaking up for ourselves and their greed.
898 2018-12-27 19:04:35 This is fakest drop none of the big stocks or indices have made a lower low

908 2018-12-27 19:01:10 If you’re in a long only account and want to profit on the downside from the exorbitantly overpriced FAANG stocks then try $FNGD. The ETN is inversely leveraged 3x the FAANG names and it also includes $BABA $BIDU $NVDA $TSLA & $TWTR.
909 2018-12-27 19:01:00 I see no reason why the stocks are down except for tax reasons and a few uncertainties . Nothing with business and profit . 2019 will be a winner
910 2018-12-27 19:00:29 I am sure you mean well. But let’s just review some facts. The President did go visit troops in Iraq. The stock market is adjusting so the rich can scoop up stocks on the bottom side. And potential immigrants that drug their kids 4000 miles can’t be responsible for their health.
911 2018-12-27 18:59:07 Business! Stocks and shares!
912 2018-12-27 18:58:57 ZBC news:Acting President Chiwenga tours NatPharm, which seemingly has drug stocks&medical supplies.Why aren't those drugs going to hospitals? 
2.This thing of Chiwenga saying they will rely on student doctors is harmful,these are interns there to learn not provide expert opinion
913 2018-12-27 18:58:48 How is Netflix down in stocks when them bitches just took $15 outta my pocket
914 2018-12-27 18:58:35 #shortlist #stockmarkets #stocks to short #NOW #PAYC #SHOP more downside and pain to come for these high fliers.  #NASDAQ will not stabilize anytime soon in 2019.
915 2018-12-27 18:57:41 I always wish I had the foresight to buy stocks when they’re low and sell high right away.

Lazy bastards like me never get rich.

917 2018-12-27 18:56:31 Stock Insanity...Dow down 550...after being up 1,000 yesterday, and down 650 on Christmas eve  never seen anything like this in the  last 10 years..,.,trump claims stocks are is report card...how do you  like him now?
918 2018-12-27 18:56:20 Love stocks action!!! May buy those calls we made 40% on yesterday back at end of day. Looking for certain things.  These people in the market are so emotional.  I look at data...objective, disciplined, and not greedy.  Best way to be in this mkt.  Love the volatility. Not advice
919 2018-12-27 18:56:18 They only lost if they sold it at a loss. Otherwise you just hold and hope. If you held BTC for the last 5 years or Stocks, you still came up on the BTC higher (given this weeks stock happenings)
920 2018-12-27 18:55:03 .U.S. stocks surged Wednesday, recovering much of their losses from a Christmas Eve plunge and placing the market on track for its best day in nine months.
921 2018-12-27 18:54:38 Guns are not invented for murder and bump-stocks doesn't mean "military grade". Bump firing is nothing new and you don't need a stock to bump fire. Hellfire systems came out over 30 yrs ago. You can also fire from the use of a belt loop on a pair of pants.
922 2018-12-27 18:54:18 There are so many stocks poised on an island H&S with a sharp drop below. It doesn’t make sense all these stocks would experience sudden rallies right from the same precipice.

924 2018-12-27 18:53:59 Hey @TomArnold - What makes your opinion "words of truth"?  Inquiring minds want to know.  The NRA has offered me gun safety classes, protection of the home classes and agreed with the ban on bump stocks.  Never once did they offer a class on shooting innocents...

928 2018-12-27 18:53:19 Yesterday’s Dow had a record setting point gain. This during the worst December in market history, a skyrocketing Volatility Index (VIX) and a worldwide equity slump. Mnuchin was under fire by rump for not settling markets. Anyone else suspect that Treasury manipulated stocks?

936 2018-12-27 18:49:51 I am hearing from my friends on the NYSE that their GOLBISTS costumers are so mad that the Stock Market was up 1100 points yesterday that they are selling off their stocks even if they lose money & one of the biggest sellers is George Soros trying to tank the market, TRAITOR!!!!
937 2018-12-27 18:49:24 Muh Russian bot orange man bad! Orange man decrease stocks! Orange man bad. Fed increasing rates good. But orange man bad.
938 2018-12-27 18:49:17 Lmao I was happy because my stocks went up 50 bucks yesterday. But they're already down 43 today. 
Thanks Trump
939 2018-12-27 18:49:00 Guess what? Let’s start a conversation. Why in your mind do you believe bump stocks should be legal to purchase?
940 2018-12-27 18:48:56 I suggest you google the Dow Jones daily averages from 2009 to today. My 401k is down $38,000 since the 1st of the year.  My best stock market and commodity prices gains were under the Obama years and I’ve been semi retired for 20 years. How’s your stocks doing Cowboy?
941 2018-12-27 18:48:33 it's like getting mad at the difference between a furry and a brony. who gives a fuck you're both laughing stocks
942 2018-12-27 18:48:13 @sizehelpteam Hi, can I check why is my order #85106669 cancelled when there were a lot stocks available when I made my order?
943 2018-12-27 18:48:06 $TSLA really is the Rasputin of garbage stocks.
944 2018-12-27 18:47:52 Agree.
German #DAX already down 20% this year - The lowest since 2008!

945 2018-12-27 18:47:49 strikes me as in all of those instances stocks were substantially higher 12m later
946 2018-12-27 18:47:43 Stocks post huge gain with you in war zone and getting hammered with you in WH. Go to Syria or Afghanistan and stay.

947 2018-12-27 18:47:29 If you own shares of Mindbody it’s likely you’ll profit from recently announced sale of the business. Now that’s it’s almost inevitable, you can cash in today while it’s near the sale price of $36.50/share and buy other quality stocks while they’re on sale.
948 2018-12-27 18:47:19 so you now, Doug kass really doesn't trade stocks. look at this twitter his feed, he's a writer, not a trader. He's a wannabe trader tough
949 2018-12-27 18:47:07 WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH HOUSES TO MEET NEED. So your grandparents had council houses, back in the golden age of the 1950s. So what. That is not where we are now. Forty years of running down social housing stocks can't easily be corrected.
950 2018-12-27 18:47:05 There is other stocks or careers?
951 2018-12-27 18:46:55 I think @cnbc said this morning that all stocks in the S&P finished in the green except Newmont Mining...................

953 2018-12-27 18:46:13 investment group nancy909 - prepare to execute buy orders at 1:55pm. make sure they are in the tech/comm/energy/retail stocks.
954 2018-12-27 18:46:03 Well a friend of a friend of a friend to a certain CNN reporter told me so
She (this reporter) apparently stocks this particular brand and her home used to be a fav hangout of this lady & her husband ....
The lady is now transferred somewhere else
955 2018-12-27 18:44:45 These types of companies can easily cause stocks to fall so not really surprised. They will stabilize for sure but just depends on the amount of damage caused till that happens. Don't like EA at all but equally dont like stock market free fall to happen
956 2018-12-27 18:44:34 @AUCHAN_France j’ai commandé le 7 décembre 4 menus pour le 31 décembre ! Je reçois un mail ce soir me disant que je n’aurai pas ma commande car plus de stocks!

960 2018-12-27 18:43:44 I don't know much about Stocks and or the Dow but has anyone else notice the Dow started to drop after the midterms when the Dems won the house back! The world and this country does not have confidence when Dems have any kind of control!
961 2018-12-27 18:43:29 Bump stocks are trash to begin with. I can fire faster and more accurately with my trigger finger. Than with a bump stock.

963 2018-12-27 18:42:45 I was just having a discussion with my friends - That at what point in Crypto, I am planning to shift to Traditional assets like Gold, Stocks etc. to secure my Future.

I just put the point - That imagine if blockchain is the real future and BTC is the real catalyst...
964 2018-12-27 18:42:28 It might have been a minefield once but we've already stepped on the biggest mine on earth and it's about to go off with the power of billions of atomic bombs. We've unleashed earth's biggest albedo right on top of earth's biggest methane stocks. Please fasten your seatbelts.
965 2018-12-27 18:42:25 According to whom? Any recollection of the recession he pulled us out of? Do you know anyone with a preexisting health condition? How are your stocks looking now?  And, wow, the deficit is booming but in the wrong direction. Please don't rewrite history, we have enough problems.
966 2018-12-27 18:41:36 Crees que te diriges a uribistas ignorantes que no saben que stocks son acciones bursátiles. Los stocks controlados por fondos privados, son manejados por los Lobos de Wall Street no de Hollywood sino de chibchombia.
967 2018-12-27 18:39:40 got bonds not stocks bitch, that’s how you save, and when i cross the street i look both fuckin’ ways 
968 2018-12-27 18:39:39 I don't know how people can act like Puritans hurling rotten veggies at their neighbors being humiliated in the stocks. Human nature hasn't changed much I guess. I saw a strong woman fighting against obvious gender based discrimination. #TeamRhylee
969 2018-12-27 18:39:26 Added 500 more $EXK at $2.14.  Silver reviving and gold very strong. Gold-silver stocks are primed for a big move higher.
970 2018-12-27 18:38:08 His performance?

Tarrifs killing farmers to the point he had to do a bailout 
The wall that Mexico was supposed to pay for turning into a government shutdown unless WE foot the bill
No replacement on healthcare as he promised
971 2018-12-27 18:37:59 For every active manager holding "high quality" stocks, some other active manager must be holding "lower quality" stocks. Should net to zero for active management as a whole. Agree with Ptak - look at a broader representation of the market (i.e. VTSMX).
972 2018-12-27 18:36:46 The rich get richer via ultra low interest rates via @federalreserve, which they use to purchase income producing assets like stocks and real estate (thus the current bubble). They poor get screwed by having their purchasing power stolen via inflation. /2

974 2018-12-27 18:36:05 We are open again on Friday and Saturday. We have a delivery from one of the local supermarkets at 12 of surplus food which will be free to anyone who needs it. Stocks will be limited. Happy New Year!
975 2018-12-27 18:35:37 every time you beat classic mode, the shop in the vault section re stocks with 2-3 songs depending on how many slots you have open
976 2018-12-27 18:35:11 I'm on Mark's team. I know what he was doing. He did buy those stocks...with tight stops. If I am correct, he only owns a pilot position in $HLF right now, and his stop has not been threatened. Mark's job isn't to keep the Twitterverse informed of every move. But he doesn't BS.
977 2018-12-27 18:35:09 Stocks are for 10 days of intense fighting in two front situation. You'd have about 3 weeks in one front situation with china. If china extends war beyond that it will have to deal with indian naval action choking off its trade

983 2018-12-27 18:33:34 YES, indirectly. O knew he had to buy off insurance industry or they would buy off Congress to kill ACA. Health care stocks been SOARING ever since ACA.

IIRC yes it was Lieberman that killed public option. Pun intended cuz lack of a public option IS killing people. Thanks Joe!

988 2018-12-27 18:32:03 Scenario A.) You have access to ∞ US Dollars. You have vested interest in the success of the US Stock Market. It begins to tank. You flood market with USD. Stocks recover. You buy time to liquidate assets. You cover yourself first. You create a new system that serves your wealth
989 2018-12-27 18:31:50 @patly4 market and stocks don't always act rationally. That's why I saw the opportunity to start buying
990 2018-12-27 18:31:19 Rates are recovering after yesterday’s spike resulting from a weak 5 year Treasury and a big bounce in stocks. As the year wind downs, the markets will have plenty to digest heading into 2019.
991 2018-12-27 18:31:10 Just received an email from my SIPP provider titled "The importance of cash in 2019".  Guess it is time to have less of the stuff lodged with them by buying some stocks :-)
992 2018-12-27 18:31:09 
993 2018-12-27 18:30:28 I don't think mass buying SM stocks even worth it anymore. It's more like your pension day saving now instead of investing to a forward moving top kr ent company.
994 2018-12-27 18:30:20 He banned bumps stocks. More socialist than Obama.
995 2018-12-27 18:29:48 I'm sorry, but I really believe that while we have insufficient social housing to prevent homelessness, it is downright immoral of the likes of @KateOsamor to continue to occupy social housing she doesn't need. And building up social housing stocks would take years.
996 2018-12-27 18:29:22 @BrexitCentral @patcondell  She's happy her Rye + Hastings fishermen constituents continue to fish whilst EU fishermen (primarily Frogs) industrially vacuum our fish stocks. Also aligns with her brother's REMAIN lobbying PR company stance. 
997 2018-12-27 18:29:14 Apparently stocks for gaming and tech companies are falling. I wonder if it has anything to do with the constant bad business practices.
998 2018-12-27 18:28:46 Economy is great. Unemployment low, growth high, inflation low. People pay Wall Street to value and trade stocks correctly to make profit for the clients. Market price moves because of WS activities. Now why WS is chaotic in buying and selling? Defraud? #MAGA @realDonaldTrump

1000 2018-12-27 18:28:39 How cool. Our #DraftDodger Presudent ditches the country after stocks crash and defense secretary quits. What a #Coward
1001 2018-12-27 18:28:19 Sure and that’s why I like the approximation I’ve seen you make of genuflection to this or that theorist as stock trading. That people do make hay by sitting on stagnant stocks doesn’t disprove the logics that make the trading floor tick.
1002 2018-12-27 18:27:26 Last I checked we invented guns to murder. Also suicide. Also I'm just trying to wrap my head around why you support bump stocks like the one used in Las Vegas. Remember this is your hobby. You can make do with a bolt action rifle that isn't a military grade killing machine.
1003 2018-12-27 18:27:07 What period of time have you been bullish on the economy and therefore domestic stocks?
1004 2018-12-27 18:27:04 It's ok they changed it back. They updated it to tap through posts instead of scrolling, everyone hated it, their stocks crashed, so they changed it back while saying 'it was a bug but we fixed it!!11!'
Wild
1005 2018-12-27 18:26:54 You’re right about “common” sense, but it’s impossible to ignore the corrupting influence of money and marketing that muddies the water when it comes to reasonable restrictions on guns, like fully banning bump stocks, supporting the AWB, and holding manufacturers accountable.
1006 2018-12-27 18:25:56 This is the first time since I've been covering markets that stocks have gone down a lot for a while, and I'm surprised that permabears have basically just gotten more bearish.
1007 2018-12-27 18:25:39 I'd go further ....if say foreign owned companies and individuals should not be allowed to buy UK housing stocks either
1008 2018-12-27 18:25:25 when/if anyone like Sanders/Warren/Harris get near the WH....US stocks lose 50% in a NY minute. job losses and declines in home prices as US Fed moves to crush capitalism and appoint few favored DC bureaucrats to manage nation's inevitable slide to scarcity.....wealth flees fast
1009 2018-12-27 18:25:07 High-yield dividend stocks to add to your portfolio. Pay yourself every quarter. $T $PEP $AAPL $IBM $PM $WM $HBI
1010 2018-12-27 18:24:58 India can also replenish stocks for up to 3 weeks of intense fighting in a one front scenario. Anything longer would see Indian navy choking off chinese shipping planes through Indian Ocean to force chinese to end the conflict.
1011 2018-12-27 18:24:53 Ok, I nibbled on some stocks...crash can get started now...  
1012 2018-12-27 18:24:01 Stocks rise and fall all year. I said  that the dow Jones dropped 4,000 points in 7 days and gained 1'000 in 1 day. That's a difference of negative 3,000. You can check my math
1013 2018-12-27 18:23:08 They will report a boss  quarter. Stocks about to soar... Again.

1018 2018-12-27 18:21:22 ok, makes sense. do you go with penny stocks or what? theyre risky but can actually make money
1019 2018-12-27 18:21:20 I look around and lots of Stocks look really 'cheap' now but that means nothing in this Market where Valuations have become irrelevant. Market Participants are projecting forwards that Earnings will fall so Valuation Multiples would be artificially high. Not a Market to buy.

1026 2018-12-27 18:19:57 Defense stocks are on the rise. Just bought into a defense industry ETF and so far it's up 3.01%. Doing way better than my healthcare fund. FYI.
1027 2018-12-27 18:19:47 Saw something about stocks up 1080 or so today. What's up with that if the Fed raised the interest rate and there is a rebound from the recent drop?

1030 2018-12-27 18:18:22 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC I am trying to get into the stock market now that I have graduated college. Is now a good time to invest in $JNJ or do you think it will drop even more? Are there better stocks to buy right now in my just-graduated situation? #MadTweets
1031 2018-12-27 18:17:57 You may think I'm nuts, but I've decided to begin investing in stocks. But I will diversify, chicken, beef, and vegetable.
My calculations say in 2 years I should be a boullionaire.


1032 2018-12-27 18:17:24 It's an entertainment show about sports. Not actual analysis. Just like Jik Cramer's Mad Money is an entertainment show about stocks. It's not for insight, people enjoy the extremes.
1033 2018-12-27 18:17:17 Meth stocks up 150%

1036 2018-12-27 18:16:47 Vegas shooter used bump stocks...ban bump stocks. Tim Mcveigh used a bomb in a uhaul truck. Ban uhaul trucks?? Just dumb
1037 2018-12-27 18:16:37 groups d1-d25 commence "Super-Buy" in 10 mins. Tech/Comm/Retail stocks.
1038 2018-12-27 18:16:25 after Mnuchin reassured him Jay can’t be fired legally, stocks skyrocketed. Market knew the real trouble: Demagogue himself 
1039 2018-12-27 18:16:14 Even under the rosiest view (from Election Day), stocks are only up 3000, not 7000.

That’s definitely some Trump level math you’re using there.
1040 2018-12-27 18:16:03 Circular logic. If rates are too high and they come down they automatically make stocks more attractive. I guess DB is saying buy with both hands. Is that your interpretation too?
1041 2018-12-27 18:15:59 Stocks go up. Stocks go down. Still way up since Trump took office. It’ll be okay John.

1048 2018-12-27 18:14:10 Will you ever place mean-reversion trades off of heavily oversold conditions such as yesterday's?  Perhaps not with individual stocks, but with leveraged ETFs such as TQQQ and SPXL?
1049 2018-12-27 18:13:54 groups c1-c9 commence "Super-Buy" in 5 mins. Tech and Energy stocks.

1052 2018-12-27 18:13:32 Crazy run?

Markets are down 11% YTD, including yesterday’s rally.

23 months into his term (up 13.5%) stocks are underperforming both Obama (up 44.7%) and Clinton (up 15.8%).
1053 2018-12-27 18:13:31 my two stocks are real jerks
1054 2018-12-27 18:13:20 cuz scarcity is a sales tactic and they need revenue bcs stocks are shit atm.
1055 2018-12-27 18:13:07 Today, December 27th is the last day for tax-loss selling on the $TSX. Good luck to all as we are approaching the new year. Meanwhile I'm avoiding #weed stocks and focusing on #oil as they could be a turn around in the near future.
1056 2018-12-27 18:13:03 Just the bump stocks.
1057 2018-12-27 18:12:56 Stocks plunged as Mylan Inc. unveiled a fastidious outlet today.
1058 2018-12-27 18:12:40 Ugh.  I am small time so everything counts.  SO hard stepping out of the market and ditching my favorite, and most volatile, stocks.  Keep us in the loop.

1063 2018-12-27 18:10:50 Bump stocks are for idiots that cant put a trigger in an AR, got an elftmann tactical that can waste just as much ammo
1064 2018-12-27 18:10:50 #stocks are nuts, up one day, down the next. #Consumerconfidence down but holiday sales up 5%. This is what happens when you give #Ds the #House. It'll be like this until at least the 2020 election. (it would be worse if they had both House & Senate). Get used to it.
1065 2018-12-27 18:09:50 Disregard the news. Buy those stocks now because shit bout to sky rocket next month. I’m sure of it
1066 2018-12-27 18:09:44 Bitcoin was invented to stop men with guns from being able to control money. Neither bitcoin, now bitcoin cash have a traditional fundamental value proposition like stocks do. Inviting men with guns and "the law" back to adjudicate between two ideas is btc heresy.

1074 2018-12-27 18:07:32 Instagram stocks prolly went down with the new layout that they had to go back to the original lmao
1075 2018-12-27 18:07:02 what's the point of losing my money to stocks over the course of 10 years when I can lose my money at the Hard Rock tonight
1076 2018-12-27 18:07:01 Such BS. Bump stocks are not necessary except for those who plan on wiping out a lot of people at one time. And no, there will never be a complete ban on guns in this country. Stop being paranoid, you geezers.
1077 2018-12-27 18:06:55 Another buying sign cnn has Dow with huge bug on right side and talking stocks
1078 2018-12-27 18:06:47 So the stocks are dropping and all Donald Trump cares about is a fucking wall?
1079 2018-12-27 18:05:57 I even invested stocks in j c Penny I lost money but I tried lol
1080 2018-12-27 18:05:34 We are at a point where an increase of .01 $/lb of copper raises associated stocks by ~5%. Hopefully we see the return of the supply and demand relationship for this metal next year before the world runs out! Happy new years peeps
1081 2018-12-27 18:05:19 When the stock market was up they gave credit to obama lol. Now that its down cause what goes up must come down in stocks as well now its trumps stock market lol democrats are delusional
1082 2018-12-27 18:05:11 There is always that risk, but we suspect the $TSLAQ crowd will quickly cease to be the target of their ire. As with so many cult stocks and cultish tech leaders, the vast majority of former followers will probably be too busy raging at their erstwhile savior to care about us.
1083 2018-12-27 18:05:00 Somebody buy me some stocks next Christmas
1084 2018-12-27 18:04:34 I do own bakereverything plus I been doing stocks for 2 years I do own stocks
1085 2018-12-27 18:03:48 And that folks is why they are going to have a HUGE Bash at Mara Largo! Trump inc will make a killing! We taxpayers will pay for Everything! Added security all of it.. because he is our President And Owns the property! Stocks take a beating, so great money maker for Trump Inc!
1086 2018-12-27 18:03:45 As well they should. Even if you agree with banning bump stocks, a President should not and does not have the power to do so unilaterally. It should be done via Congress not the Executive Branch.
1087 2018-12-27 18:03:37 $uvxy dancing between $90-$92 either side of breakout will push things higher or lower and can be used to trade stocks or indices around it...
1088 2018-12-27 18:03:24 You would do well to watch @edcroft talk from Mello @InvestedGeordie ... after a bull market ends get out of speculative stocks like FDEV. I recall you being up 15% YTD at one point.
1089 2018-12-27 18:02:58 If stocks were valued at non-speculative valuations (which I realize is just a crazy dream) I doubt they would drop much if oil prices collapsed. Oil industry related stocks would get pounded, but would tech stocks, for example? Then again, bank stocks would suffer, so who knows.
1090 2018-12-27 18:02:57 And stocks are falling again.  Stay away.
1091 2018-12-27 18:02:25 Banning bump stocks of course!
1092 2018-12-27 18:02:23 S'il faut évacuer les stocks, on peut aider

1096 2018-12-27 18:01:24 What strong economy? Have you ever seen the stocks since you became PM? And stop using my tax dollars to pay for other people's problems, how do you expect us young people to save up to start a family if you just keep taxing the hell out of us?!
1097 2018-12-27 18:01:11 Love the media. “Confidence falls, stocks lower!”  No, actually a bunch of people (or bots) bought yesterday and they’re taking profits today.
1098 2018-12-27 18:00:43 Yes, it's so much fun not nowing how to buy groceries, heat bill in winter, gas for the car, rent, mortgages. Trying to figure out how you are going to live. They are working because they're bored and have millions in the banks or stocks. WTH!

1104 2018-12-27 17:59:15 @ScufFrance bonjour , pourquoi pratiquement toutes vos manettes sont en ruptures de stocks ? Car j’aimerais en commander une 
1105 2018-12-27 17:58:57 Stocks en el tweet de Krugman significa acciones, no inventarios. Usted ni sabe inglés ni sabe de economía. Ese es el tweet mas ignorante y atrevido que se ha visto en Twitter, sin duda
1106 2018-12-27 17:57:59 “More of a risk than not” late entry on false straw man arguments of the year? Excessive guns? That makes no sense, and bump stocks are few and far between. It’s quite clear you’re no better than the tool who claims he’s “not racist, but...”
1107 2018-12-27 17:57:42 Shannon, term's been used on Wall Street since before 1986 when I first ventured into the land of missing dollars. When a stock or stocks tanked, professional investors looked for a "dead cat bounce" to help them clear the rest of their holdings of the stock & recover some $$
1108 2018-12-27 17:56:55 Guarantee you I can pull the trigger damn near as fast as these so called bump stocks.
1109 2018-12-27 17:56:43 Does this mean that the valuation metric is X times for growth stocks vs value stocks.

Where X> Historical Average and increasing?
1110 2018-12-27 17:56:36 “Stocks sink as he returns”
1111 2018-12-27 17:55:56 Stock picks of the day | Panic low of 10,535 may provide support; 2 stocks to bet on: Going ahead, we expect Nifty to hold the 10,600-mark…
1112 2018-12-27 17:55:43 I would pick #Bitcoin over any asset of your choosing.---- BTW that includes Stocks, bonds, Gold, Land, Real Estate, Art, Collectibles, any digital asset.
1113 2018-12-27 17:55:29 99% of people that own bump stocks shoot for fun in their backyards. To ban something at the federal level because of one person’s actions is what’s more asinine.  Because it’s not gonna stop mass murder or even put a dent in it. How many mass shootings took place since Vegas?
1114 2018-12-27 17:55:27 Actually stocks are up about 20% since November, 2016, fact. The debt is a huge problem, but no one from your side seemed to care about it for the previous 8 years, which makes me skeptical of the lefts convictions now. I know we won’t change each other’s minds. Hope all is well!
1115 2018-12-27 17:55:21 What companies/index does that cover? One difference is that tech stocks scale/ provide growth that probably wasn't possible back then
1116 2018-12-27 17:55:21 We’re not “after” that correction yet. Q4 deceleration data hasn’t finished coming in to say the least. High beta tech stocks have more hits to take
1117 2018-12-27 17:55:03 My criteria for shorting:

* Must be headed for a sharp drop, soon
* Did not rally well or out of any meaningful lines yesterday or post-Thanksgiving 
* Have ghastly charts 
* Generally well behaved stocks
* Reasonable bid/ask spreads
1118 2018-12-27 17:54:35 $TSLA is one of my favorite and most profitable stocks. Bought it back again at 296, flipped it at 324. I'll happily buy it back again under $300
1119 2018-12-27 17:54:30 That's way too many stocks
1120 2018-12-27 17:54:27 Blaming the fed is an excuse....who was buying NVDA at 30x sales, FB at 50x earnings, NFLX at $400 or 1000k EPs..not the fed...stocks needed to come down after 9 years of almost straight up
1121 2018-12-27 17:53:59 You never reported stocks when they were going up so stifle it Edith.
1122 2018-12-27 17:53:39 I only buy stocks once they are up 100% in one day. So bought some $WATT at $9.48
1123 2018-12-27 17:53:18 Shares of chip stocks are trading lower after RBC analysts reportedly issued cautious commentary on NVIDIA $NVDA citing potential softness in the gaming sector. $AMD taking a hit as well as 50% off 2018 highs at just below $17 now.
1124 2018-12-27 17:52:40 when  Trump leaves the country the stocks zoom up and when he comes back they drop
1125 2018-12-27 17:51:37 is this bullish or bearish for stocks?

1131 2018-12-27 17:47:57 Yup I'm aware of this, my beef isn't against guns because I believe in the second amendment my beef is with excessive guns and add-ons for guns like bump stocks.
1132 2018-12-27 17:47:44 I have owned stocks since 1971 and I still use professional advice because it's objective. I do trade a small account on my own in highly speculative option strategies but would never risk more than a few percent of my total capital. Happy New Year Cullen
1133 2018-12-27 17:47:11 Typical stock market. Scare you to sell billionaires step in and buy your stocks low. Now you can't afford to buy them back. 
Ever hear of volley in the market?
1134 2018-12-27 17:47:04 I work in stocks here and it’s actually quite normal
1135 2018-12-27 17:47:02 The corporations buy back of stocks where a waste of money. The chickens are going to roast. There tax cut from 35 % to 22 % percent should have been to hire more personnel. Now everyone is doom.

1138 2018-12-27 17:46:14 It's amazing to have held US stocks that went nowhere, but your portfolio went up in CAD
1139 2018-12-27 17:46:12 No no no. Stocks are just “another option”.
1140 2018-12-27 17:46:12 UK Market Close: Stocks end lower as US rally proves short-lived
1141 2018-12-27 17:46:06 the  big rip off on the US markets might not stop until all middle class is force to sell  all their stocks. This rip off has not been seen until the great depression.. American greed has increased 10 folds in the last 60 days. Corporate and Rich people greed , that is the cause.
1142 2018-12-27 17:45:18 I see huge difference between Feb and Oct-Nov-Dec

Feb vix was extremely jumpy almost +10/-10 every other day

Q4 18, vix developed an uptrend similar to traditional stocks, barring couple of weeks in Nov (rangebound ~7pts),vix saw a grind rather than spike

Vvix seems consitent
1143 2018-12-27 17:44:45 Thought you closed your accounts with them to focus on stocks.

1148 2018-12-27 17:43:33 It already has crashed.  Pound down 15%.  Stock market down 15%.   British stocks roughly 30% cheaper if your wealth is in dollars or euros.  Winner!
1149 2018-12-27 17:43:13 Yes,  and “we will incrementally reduce are equity exposure as stocks get less expensive”.  LOL
1150 2018-12-27 17:42:45 Soooo @instagram y’all ain’t learn from snap chat and stocks plummeting about making changes that the consumer DOES NOT LIKE 
1151 2018-12-27 17:42:43 Okay. Fun fact time. 

When I was a kid I asked my brother how stocks are determined. 

He described an interdimensional being the spewed our arbitrary numbers on a paper. 

The image on the right is exactly what I thought the stock market was until like. Later on.
1152 2018-12-27 17:42:43  not at all, I’m happy we have won 2games on the bounce!
1153 2018-12-27 17:42:23 When does Doug kass have to time to actually trade stocks or do research? Oh yeah, he doesn't really trade he just blows up  twitter and real money pro blog all day
1154 2018-12-27 17:41:58 “Stocks are flat over the last 18 months” doesn’t quite have the same alarming ring to it
1155 2018-12-27 17:41:45 They changed it back really soon after the update because so many people complained and their stocks' values decreased dramatically

1164 2018-12-27 17:39:53 And it’s only while stocks last - so you theoretically could buy 2, and if the signed ones are gone you’ll get 2 unsigned. I’ve suddenly lost my taste for bourbon

1185 2018-12-27 17:35:21 I remember reading that Pelosi literally sits on the congressional committee that approves huge corporate mergers (i.e. Disney/Fox) and she just buys the stocks b4 the gov publically approves such mergers. I always wondered how she was legally able to do that. Now I know. Smh.
1186 2018-12-27 17:35:19 Whenever there is a post-big-drop surge, isn't most of it just buying back stocks on the cheap? No surprise there's another drop after a surge. Those that have just driving down stock prices so they can buy back at savings?
1187 2018-12-27 17:35:18 Yeah I do think it would be interesting if live stats weren’t so easily available. Because sometimes it FEELS like a guy is doing more or less than he is w/r/t number of shots made or missed or stocks or rebounds or whatever it may be. Just think it would be interesting

1220 2018-12-27 17:24:34 Stocks are a risk by nature and were never a safe haven for money. When it comes to economic depression, who knows. The future looks rocky but it could change just like that (snap)

1224 2018-12-27 17:23:20 Wall Street big wigs finally coming to see reality , the way they compure their software is now creating the " flat screen syndrome" . Ordinary middle class people lost money and they do not want buy stocks no matter how low it goes. Wall Street did not see that coming.
1225 2018-12-27 17:23:05 Stocks have been pilling up cause furnace oil plants have been offline or operating at very low capacities.

1226 2018-12-27 17:22:33 1) most ETFs and ETNs are toxic derivatives that few understand, just buy the stocks. 2) I'm a value buyer, I don't see many bargains yet. 3) in 2008 SPX was down over 50%, SPX is only down 17% from an overvalued sugar high

1228 2018-12-27 17:21:33 Well now, since Labour's wealth comes from its members and supporters...could this be "crony capitalism"? Since there are no stocks or publically quoted shares, it is a privately owned company.
1229 2018-12-27 17:21:09 @smartertrader I think it's hilarious that people think that stocks can't go much lower
1230 2018-12-27 17:20:55 Most of these stocks are developing "inside day candlestick" formation .

1234 2018-12-27 17:20:29 You should research this. If you’re missing this component then you’re missing a huge chunk of the discourse. For example how do you think stocks are valued? Or budgets set? Losses calculated? Prices set? This is key to understanding our system.
1235 2018-12-27 17:20:28 no. High dividend yield stocks are likely to be cheap hence. its not the cause but correlation
1236 2018-12-27 17:20:04 Right on. Owning stocks is a good idea. I recommend $SPY, which is a good index ETF. I don't know about whether it's a good idea to buy now, but if so it's a good one! Cheers, Elmer.

1242 2018-12-27 17:17:00 Here's what I'm seeing - stocks are low because investors are timid after yesterday's massive day. If we close anywhere near yesterday, it might be safe to assume there will be some more gains tomorrow! #investing #StockMarket #StockMarketNews

1268 2018-12-27 17:08:15 What stocks did “he” suggest in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018? And where are those stocks now? Oo. Were they not all winners?
1269 2018-12-27 17:07:29 I am pretty certain the stock market is being affected by all of this too.  People need to keep in mind that the more stocks they sell the lower their RMD's will be (if applicable), and the tax revenue collected by our government will suffer.  It is a no win situation.

1298 2018-12-27 17:00:29 Bump stocks illegal
Pro-gun group sues POTUS Trump
Who did the right thing
#politicshaiku
1299 2018-12-27 17:00:24 Bump stocks have been illegal in states since 1990. The federal ban is long overdue. Oh. @CNN did u forget to report that @POTUS took on this issue.
1300 2018-12-27 17:00:04 U invested in pot stocks?  Gotta say ya gotta keep close eyes on those. I made good then lost, now slowly gaining.
1301 2018-12-27 16:59:48 I also don’t see why the raiders or any similar team would give up anything of worth for a currently damaged asset. If you talk stocks you are selling low. Just look at Andrew luck (who had a way more serious injury) to see how assets can recover.
1302 2018-12-27 16:59:03 In other words:

$VIX price movement (HV30) is like $TSLA stocks (Just for an example)

$VVIX is the premium paid for buying $VIX options.

$VVIX or $VIX options premium is priced at $WMT options premium.

Got it?

What does it all imply?  Common sense right? How can this happen?
1303 2018-12-27 16:58:48 You may be right however, I do not want to see stocks end deep in the red. I would like to see it end flat, hold for a day or two, then short it. Lets see how it plays out.
1304 2018-12-27 16:58:46 My short theory; if eorl markets crash, btc crashes harder. Inverted, if stocks climb up then btc have a better change of ending the bearmarket
1305 2018-12-27 16:58:31 Don't blink. Stocks are sinking after record gains.
1306 2018-12-27 16:58:28 Taking all the money I have in stocks out the stock market since Trump fucked it up,im relocating that bread to investing in housing/property.. by the end of this month I will be a partial owner of a house in Bronx  im really on my JayZ shit

1308 2018-12-27 16:57:33 What a conundrum , Republican President banning bump stocks . Who would of think it ?
1309 2018-12-27 16:56:42 Je n'est pas dit le contraire . "Soit disant" ? Mais je n'est rien à prouvé.  Tout est un commerce de nos jours. C'est bien parce que tu n'a jamais vu les français qui passe en Belgique faire leurs stocks. Je suis un petit "fraudeur"...

1311 2018-12-27 16:56:17 Not really, if you look at all the cases of mass/public/school shootings, bump stocks have not been a factor in the overwhelming majority and thus banning them will not make an impact
1312 2018-12-27 16:54:45 People that short stocks lol. Sad. You set your own noose.
1313 2018-12-27 16:54:24 canadian marijuana stocks are unfairly being associated with real stocks and getting hit as a result
1314 2018-12-27 16:54:15 Good point.  But also active managers might hold higher quality stocks that hold up better in a down market.
1315 2018-12-27 16:54:14 Ok, so, we need to make it LESS easy to kill a bunch of people all at once, and banning bump stocks can help with that.
1316 2018-12-27 16:54:02 Lol yea it was a funny beef @DOEDoobs when are your podcast coming back I’m tired of listening to white men talk about drop shipping and slow stocks

1319 2018-12-27 16:53:51 I'm considering that in all the public, school shootings, etc...bump stocks have not played a role and banning them won't make a difference
1320 2018-12-27 16:53:50 On hdfc Amc your thoughts very very clear...if u heard Big bull Ramesh dhamani / shankar sharma...they never change there thoughts very offten...atleast in 70 interv Ramesh dhmani spoke for the same trends....like Alchohal stocks ...trends dont change very offten..
1321 2018-12-27 16:53:48 Seems like @Instagram is doing a @Snapchat with this dumb update. all they need now is for @KylieJenner to tweet about deleting it and then the stocks to fall and they are fuckedddd
1322 2018-12-27 16:53:34 Which means the Economy is BOOMING! Which I know 1st hand! So why are stocks down? Because the fund managers and their Dem cronies want it to be!
1323 2018-12-27 16:53:05 Pero esos stocks que hablan en el reino que cita el señor de la Colombia humana son stocks pero de acciones de las empresas que son medidas por ese standard que muestra la gráfica,tampoco es hablar por hablar.
1324 2018-12-27 16:52:45 Having said that, I want that gimp in the Cardiff end who held onto the ball before chucking it back into the crowd for a laugh in the fucking stocks the next time we play them at the Bridge (hopefully in the 2030s)
1325 2018-12-27 16:52:36 Machine guns have been illegal in this country for decades. Bump stocks essentially convert a gun to a machine gun. And your "only one mass shooting", was Las Vegas where 458 people were shot, 58 of them fatally, in a matter of just a few minutes. What is the matter with you??
1326 2018-12-27 16:52:24 Unfortunately, the casualties would've been about as high.  He had ample firepower and means

What I'm saying is that if you look at all the school shootings and public shootings, bump stocks have not really been a factor so banning them is political theater but useless
1327 2018-12-27 16:51:52 Don’t get distracted folks, by potus’ low bar of visiting the troops finally, the MAGA through bankruptcy falling stocks - this maybe the most incriminating of all!
1328 2018-12-27 16:51:33 Why hold on to all the high risk stocks when I can cash in a small percentage for something that’s guaranteed good rn and controlled for several years?

1333 2018-12-27 16:49:19 The NRA is for banning Bump Stocks, but please continue to spread lies that they're pro-rocket launcher.

The left has spent so long perpetuating the myth that the NRA are 2A purists like the GOA, that many on right/libertarians actually believe it.
1334 2018-12-27 16:48:58 Knowing when you should do technical analysis over fundamental analysis is a valuable art one posses. In my opinion now it is the time to focus on fundamentals rather than technicals and pick cheap stocks. $SPY $QQQ $IWM $DIA

1338 2018-12-27 16:47:20 The post I responded to said progunners won't be happy until everyone had a gun in their purse or on their person . The comment I responded to originally  ever mentioned bump stocks . Reading is fundamental

1346 2018-12-27 16:45:13 Please explain to me how a regulation on bump stocks is unconstitutional? I respect and believe in the 2A. I have read the 2A many times. I guarantee you that there is not a single word about bump stocks ( which are not guns) in the 2A.
1347 2018-12-27 16:45:10 I know! Your taxes could fund your uni education and healthcare rather than tax breaks for the rich to buy stocks for their own companies (instead of putting the money into jobs, expansion etc). Levelling the playing field is totes for serious.

1352 2018-12-27 16:44:38 Eric Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America. He is using the same excuses the NRA used. No one should be in support of bump stocks!
1353 2018-12-27 16:44:23 Then they should be asking their financial advisor why a 70 year old is 95 percent in stocks, or whatever. That was a bad idea when stocks were rising and it’s a bad idea now. Trump should not have gotten credit with them nor should he be blamed.
1354 2018-12-27 16:44:22 The main reason to move from stock trading to option trading is , you can adjust in option , however you can't do it in stocks, when you take a view in stock and it goes against you, you don't have any other option than covering it , not the case with #optipnstrading
1355 2018-12-27 16:44:13 Agreed! However, I'm keenly aware of the give an inch they will take a mile theory as well. Bump stocks are useless, but they won't stop there!

1358 2018-12-27 16:43:53 This is not a "gun law". A bump stock is not a gun. There is not one word with regard to "bump stocks" in the 2A which I have read many, many times.

1367 2018-12-27 16:42:10 For you everything is black/white, win/lose, that is not an adult outlook; it's the outlook of a small child. You treated the troops like they were your base at a MAGAt rally; showing them ZERO respect. #ResignTrump Oh, and like magic; you return stocks plummet.
1368 2018-12-27 16:41:27 Then why the hell are you here? We're not talking about guns were talking about bump stocks. Guns will never be outlawed plain and simple because it would require a constitutional amendment and if you know anything that's no easy feat especially with a government like ours.
1369 2018-12-27 16:41:00 Some manufactures are also crooks sir. I'm a distributor of certain products. They do a tie up with amazon during diwali and pressure us to take the stocks also at that time.

1395 2018-12-27 16:35:18 The ban is silly.  In the last, I dunno, 50 years, a bump stock was only used in one incident of mass killing.  It's a meaningless ban because "bump stocks are scary"

1413 2018-12-27 16:29:48 What a sad tweet - Trump has done nothing but brag about the sugar high from the #GOPTaxScam & you're satisfied with 6 quarters flat? I'm about 70% in tech & buying strong growth stocks like Microsoft in the dips - I'm in much better shape than you in spite of the #TrumpSelloff

1420 2018-12-27 16:28:06 Yes and orange man bad,  right?  SMH.  Do you know that the POTUS has zero control over what the Federal Reserve does to interest rates?  Did you know that when the Fed raises rates,  stocks go down?  Did you know that if they raise them too fast it will likely cause a recession?
1421 2018-12-27 16:28:02 BASF, Allianz, Henkel, Deutsche Wohnen, Vonovia, Fuchs Petrolub that's about it not touching car related stocks
1422 2018-12-27 16:27:53 Claro que stocks se refiere a inventarios..si no entiendes esto devuelva su titulo....
1423 2018-12-27 16:27:29 Quoting index pe and saying markets have potential is a joke!

In the index some stocks are extremely expensive while some are like tuta motors.

1424 2018-12-27 16:27:23 I hope $DJi #markets #stocks #stockmarket #options  should close 100  to 150 points  low or just green  from yesterday close ..which should remove short sellers
1425 2018-12-27 16:27:17 In The Market II: This is still early in the #trading day, but after a 6.3% rally by the Innovator IBD50 #ETF on Wed., $FFTY falls 1.4% vs. a nearly 1.9% pullback by the #nasdaq composite. Yet #growth #stocks remain in bear territory for now. $FFTY up 34% in 2017 #investing

1432 2018-12-27 16:25:43 Looking at the US #stocks indexes, it's clear that the human have lost control of the #StockMarket. And the investors, especially the big ones, have lost their abilities to make investment decisions.

1438 2018-12-27 16:23:39 The 2009 to 2018  market cycle was one of the best times in your life to capitalize on building your wealth from stocks to real estate to crypto. If your still poor after the last 10 yrs there is really no help for you.

1445 2018-12-27 16:21:07 Tip of the Day - ever load up on one stock even if you have a twitch on your investment nose when you research. Diversify your investments. I always own numerous stocks, funds, and other investments as insurance. If I’m maxed out I always have good picks in waiting if one runs up

1450 2018-12-27 16:20:15 Without the shield of corporate law the obvious insanity of investing in stocks like a casino bet becomes obviously absurd and almost no one would partake. Encourage Trump and Repubs to end this farce by strengthening the dollar and stripping corporate law one layer at a time.
1451 2018-12-27 16:20:05 Y do u want to calculate the index pe?.....what do u achieve by doing dat...the index has some ridiculous stocks!

1458 2018-12-27 16:17:52 @WolfOfWeedST seasonality of usa weed stocks compared to CAD weed stocks?
1459 2018-12-27 16:17:42 I noticed the loyal Trump disciples haven’t said much about the banning of bump stocks.  Isn’t this an infringement on their well regulated militia?  

Also if @BarackObama was so terrible how come “our” President didn’t run in 2012?
1460 2018-12-27 16:17:21 Para su información.. De la mucha que le falta y usa mal, para provecho político 

Stocks se refiere en el mercado internacional es al índice accionario, no a inventarios.
1461 2018-12-27 16:17:13 Charles can be just as goofy. He keeps taking about how amazingly strong the US economy is and is clulesless about why stocks are selling on the strength. Not any better
1462 2018-12-27 16:17:10 CCI will drop with the stock market.  This is 100% Trump's fault.  Should have left Yellen in the Fed. even though an Obama appointee.  You are creating so much uncertainty that stocks (and therefore CCI) will continue to tumble.  Oh and poorly executed trade wars don't help!
1463 2018-12-27 16:16:41 Great time to be on the sideline! #Stocks
1464 2018-12-27 16:16:29 Tree shake. As long as you don’t need the money for 2 - 3 years buy good dividend paying stocks with low debt; sit back and watch the show.
1465 2018-12-27 16:16:15 Its a good indicator of the health of economy and it shows its out of wack hence why stocks plunneted during the recession and NO you cannot provide instances where there thousand 700 1000 point swings every single day for weeks. Hasnt happened sorry not even under W bush
1466 2018-12-27 16:16:02 The double-standard for defining crypto scams is absurd, as if scams don't exist in penny stocks and other markets (and far, far more elaborate and damaging, might I add). Time to stop conflating everything. You're clearly taking his argument the wrong way.
1467 2018-12-27 16:15:31 What a difference a day makes! Yesterday: all stocks were oversold:buy, buy, buy! Today,  its all about long term (and its not even noon), industrials and fixed income. Welcome to the #volatility world (implied and realized). Dusting off my books on #Delta, #Gamma and #Vega.
1468 2018-12-27 16:15:12 The recent volatility has resulted in extreme readings of investment sentiment. The % of stocks trading below their 200 day moving average, Bull/Bear ratio, Put/Call ratio, and the VIX volatility contract all say the same thing: investor sentiment is really, really, really low.
1469 2018-12-27 16:15:11 How can they continue having mass shootings if they can't have their bump stocks. You're in our thoughts and prayers!
1470 2018-12-27 16:14:22 UNITED FELLOWSHIP stocks rallying
1471 2018-12-27 16:14:17 In The Market: Today's 2% drop by the #nasdaq #DJIA #sp500 acts as an "inside day" so far. That is, the intraday high and low is nested inside the high/low of Wed.'s surge. Too early to conclude big fund managers are plunging back into #stocks @IBDinvestors #trading #charts

1474 2018-12-27 16:13:20 "Other changes include foreign-invested firms being able to raise funds by issuing stocks and bonds, and they will have the freedom to send income overseas in either yuan or foreign currencies."
1475 2018-12-27 16:13:07 I’m pro-gun, be even I got to say, what is the point of bump stocks, again?
1476 2018-12-27 16:12:47 This is the opportunity to own these businesses.......demand side may slow down in the short term...and the stocks will become cheap.

Autos,auto ancillary both.
1477 2018-12-27 16:12:47 Stocks up a thousand points at close yesterday, down four hundred points so far this morning.  The roller coaster ride continues.

1481 2018-12-27 16:11:43 Markets adjust, money moves between stocks and businesses. What I am recalling are the predictions by people like you that Trump's election would mean economic collapse. You folks were wrong, but keep ringing that same bell anyway.

1484 2018-12-27 16:10:12 @CNN @cnnbrk STOP watching the stock market. Stocks go up and down.

1485 2018-12-27 16:09:58 @Steven1_994 hi, Steven. I just watched your vids on youtube. I am currently living in Ontario. I wonder if you fry stocks on behalf of individual investor?
1486 2018-12-27 16:09:16 So @realDonaldTrump leave the States and we have a historic point surge in stocks,but as soon as he makes his way back to the States the markets plunge. Makes you wonder why
1487 2018-12-27 16:09:11 Sold my stocks on Xmas eve went all in on pallets of Toblerone chocolates
1488 2018-12-27 16:08:41 The corkscrew was firmly seated dead center of the stop, his eyes never leaving her for want of another view. Each time they met their stocks rose, climbing ever higher in unending climax. Each second became more precious than the last, even now, the slight act of sitting down

Have gold 

If all of the above collapse,
Have ammo

1503 2018-12-27 16:05:53 They just had a huge tax cut for corps and many just bought back stocks.  The tax cut could have been 10% I stead of 14% and billions would be available for other things.  Give money to people to spend and not corps in the hope it helps.
1504 2018-12-27 16:05:24 You can’t sit back and relax bc we have Trump. Trump, with this move to redefine bump stocks as machine guns (with NRA endorsement and help), has been more anti-gun than Obama by policy. Obama spoke of gun control but never acted on it.

1515 2018-12-27 16:02:21 I’m not in finance, so can Exec sell call options against their stocks? What’s the reporting requirements on that?
1516 2018-12-27 16:02:09 Wildly fluctuating stocks are a symptom of... stocks. Never over-invest in stocks. Corporate law is a government created gambling market. Every investment is a gamble/risk to some extent, but corporate law increases the gambling nature of the market by magnitudes.
1517 2018-12-27 16:02:08 Do one believes we need a border wall except your deranged cult. Please open the government so my stocks might go back up.
1518 2018-12-27 16:02:00 Not necessarily. I was talking about what it takes to break the disconnect between price and value. But if uranium stocks keep moving down with Wall Street, there could certainly be more pain/opportunity in the near term, depending on how one looks at it.

He returns and stocks tumble again.
1539 2018-12-27 15:57:41 RT @zerohedge: Did pension funds buy all the stocks they needed in just one day?:)
1540 2018-12-27 15:57:40 to all my "groups" - Let it all out, go all in. buy stocks now and do not stop until the market closes.......
1541 2018-12-27 15:57:04 WHAT just happened! Stocks were down 500 then a SURGE of algos triggered, DOW down 150, then a sharp drop back down 400+? Incredible...
1542 2018-12-27 15:56:53 Would not at all be surprised if huge traders (aka Bezo and Steyers and other's) weren't dumping stocks to make this happen. All due to Trump Derangement Syndrome

1544 2018-12-27 15:56:20 $AMZN $AAPL $GOOGL $NFLX Lots of "inside days" today in these busted FANG stocks and all of the major indexes. After such a massive rally, this isn't what you want to see. If you know what tomorrow brings, you are equating "guess" with "know." Getcha popcorn and watch the show.

1546 2018-12-27 15:54:53 From Bloomberg News " Repurchases have ballooned in recent years, to an extent where appetite for corporate  shares dwarfs all other investors as the biggest source of demand for U.S. stocks" Draw your own conclusion.

1555 2018-12-27 15:51:13 Just for the record, Trump's trade war and Powell criticism are not the big problem for stocks. Both of those things should push inflation expectations higher and the opposite has happened. The problem is that the Congressional GOP passed a fiscally unsustainable tax cut...
1556 2018-12-27 15:51:09 In the FTSE 100 there are now 30 stocks with dividend yields above 5% & of those 20 companies whose dividend yield is above 6%

1560 2018-12-27 15:50:15 Shouldn't retail stocks I.e. future group, dmart be considered like startups those focus more on increasing user base instead of profit?, If yes isn't the high pe is justified and one should buy in diversified way of same sector?
1561 2018-12-27 15:50:13 I never seen Instagram switch back to a old update so fast lmaooo they stocks were dropping

1564 2018-12-27 15:48:46 The stock markets are down today. Hmmm. Who didn’t see that coming? 
Stocks have been way over valued since the beginning of 2017... fraudulently I might add.
1565 2018-12-27 15:48:42 Stocks opened lower on Thursday, chipping away at gains made the previous day when the Dow surged more than 1,000 points.

1575 2018-12-27 15:46:11 If you invested an equal amount of money in Canada and the USA markets on the day following Donald Trump’s victory, today you’d be making money on the US stocks, and losing your shirt on the Canadian portfolio.

1581 2018-12-27 15:45:07 US markets stumble after Wednesday’s big rebound, reflecting volatility amid political uncertainty. Stocks tumbled, just one day after logging their best day in a decade. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq all slipped more than 2 percent Thursday
1582 2018-12-27 15:44:43 Stocks was just decent yesterday 
1583 2018-12-27 15:44:43 No se pero creo que los stocks o investarios son mercancias que quedan y si se desploman es que se vendieron, entiendo. Entonces que...
1584 2018-12-27 15:44:38 Which it should. You can tell someone that because their stock is lower in 2010, they should be happy? . Is their age lower too?. Stocks are made to add upon as years progress. DOW should be in the 30s by 2025.
1585 2018-12-27 15:44:17 Trump suddenly and unexpectedly leaves the country and is quiet for 16 hours: stocks soar.

Trump opens his fool mouth, says some ignorant shit, and heads for home: stocks sink.

I'm not saying correlation is causation, but.....damn.

1588 2018-12-27 15:43:43 Stocks: Can go lower, (def will eventually) but short term (1-5 days) likely need to test those lows again to see what's what

Called a ‘double bottom’.. creates W shape on a chart.

1589 2018-12-27 15:43:40 So the PRIME C.O.D. (CNBC) just cannot understand why stocks are down 400+ after yesterdays surge ... they just cannot grasp it.

In the past Bonds & Stocks were directly correlated but somewhere in the 90s their correlation went inverse.

1605 2018-12-27 15:41:19 Have they ever said this before? It strikes me as a cynical game to dupe the rubes into breaking out their wallets.

So this shareholder is pissed.
1631 2018-12-27 15:35:31 Not sure. I think with the economy levered to zero, and credit markets showing signs of strain, not sure how productive that would be. Market is clearly saying no. Not just stocks, but bonds and commodities as well.

1660 2018-12-27 15:26:43 The thing that irks me is when people state meaningless ideas as though they were meaningful, such as, "The price of stocks is never wrong." That's why I'm a fervent logical positivist.

1668 2018-12-27 15:25:54 Here's some friendly advice: Ignore the Dow. It only represents 30 stocks.
1669 2018-12-27 15:25:32 Feel like the stock market plunging in the last few days was inside knowledge of something wicked. Trump smoked and mirror everyone on his "surprised" trip to Iraq. Stocks rebounded. Could've been an assaination attempt.

1674 2018-12-27 15:23:05 Not sure what the real answer is wrt the impact algos or HFT machines are having on current mkts but I'm being told a lot of these recent moves are originating from the credit space where it's "real scary liquidity" right now and they're using stocks as a hedge.

1698 2018-12-27 15:16:45 People did this because they wanted to use email, surf the web, check stocks, and buy things online.

1712 2018-12-27 15:14:23 Certainly. General equities are only low relative to recent ridiculous highs. If you mean resource stocks ... they could go lower too, if the trade war worsens and/or the global economy slows more. But if that happens precious metals stocks should do very well...

1752 2018-12-27 15:02:08 I think you’re right. They use a market increase from one day as an argument for a healthy market after weeks of stocks falling. Seems like distortion of context to encourage bullish sentiment. Bull trap!

1797 2018-12-27 14:51:59 It’s now down 300.00.internet buying is manipulating the market and robbing the long term investor. Can’t actually value a stocks worth.
1798 2018-12-27 14:51:59 You only lost money in 2008 IF you cash out or sold all of your stock, 401k, or whatever.  If you held firm you are worth more today than you were before the crash.  Diversity means different type of stocks, bonds, international stocks, international bonds, money markets, etc.
1799 2018-12-27 14:51:56 The last time I checked, the Fed is a private bank. I want someone to explain to me why the President, along with our politicians and the American people have their fates tied to a group of greedy, corrupt families who can manipulate stocks and our economy at will.

1801 2018-12-27 14:51:37 Stocks are up and down. See-sawing. The Fed needs to roll back their latest boost, but that won't happen. China will come to the negotiating table very soon. After that, the market will settle down.
1802 2018-12-27 14:51:06 In light of the partial government shutdown we should look at the ban of bump stocks as a victory in the pursuit of common sense gun control #GunControlNow
1803 2018-12-27 14:51:00 If you glance at most real cannabis stocks (reals revs, mgmt & growth) & look at where they were a year ago, not much has changed.  May offer a buying opportunity of the real companies in the sector. $GGB.c is my favorite in the sector! @MJstockXpert @Invest420 @MJBizDaily
1804 2018-12-27 14:50:49 Of the 24 stocks on my computer, the only one that gapped up is $ROKU.
1805 2018-12-27 14:50:43 Yes, when pressed to give an estimate ... Shiller himself said c 1% p.a. on US stocks over 10 years (from May 2017) ... which is about Zero or less after charges and that feels like quite a poor return for accepting the risks we can all see now. I sense the mood has changed.
1806 2018-12-27 14:50:35 I caved and bought a massive position today.  I still think stocks are going lower, but some deals are too good to say no too.
1807 2018-12-27 14:50:27 People reacting to other people reacting is just doing it wrong- know your stocks, have a reasonable intrinsic value and take what the market gives you- talking head types, twitter jockeys will just throw you off your plan

1812 2018-12-27 14:49:50 More good news for investors: unemployment is at an all time low, technology stocks are at bargain rates, ripe for buying into. Communication stocks are also a good buy.  Best news of all US Oil is crushing the Mid-East.
1813 2018-12-27 14:49:47 yea but if the stock market crashes the economy goes in the tank. if it crashes like dems are praying for we will be in same shape as 08, and the stock market directly influences the economy, I have been dabbling in stocks for some time but I'm not arguing, I just think its nuts.
1814 2018-12-27 14:49:36 Funny... I was told they would be selling bonds and buying stocks....
1815 2018-12-27 14:49:19 #stocks The greatest danger in a bear market is investors following the "advice" of Wall Street and government. The most important things to remember are: the consensus of the experts is almost invariably dead wrong AND once a bear market gets underway, there is NO STOPPING IT!
1816 2018-12-27 14:49:13 After the best day in market history, stocks are giving back some gains this morning.  The DOW is lower by 340 points after a 1000-point gain yesterday #fox35

1829 2018-12-27 14:46:17 It must have sth to do with dumb dems selling without a clue, and reps buying. Else what would have made the stocks soar the past years?

1834 2018-12-27 14:45:29 and what is often forgotten: many insiders have to buy or hold a certain amount of stocks to get bonus payments, or it is simply part of the labour contract. and most contracts even forbid them to sell the stocks within a certain time after leaving.

1836 2018-12-27 14:45:21 His point stands.  By holding LTC year after year, you’re missing the opportunity to hold Bitcoin - a better performing asset.

Your argument is akin to holding oil stocks over the past ten years when you could’ve held Amazon.  “Hey buddy, stocks are stocks!”

1839 2018-12-27 14:45:02 I hear you, and I struggle internally on this concept. 
Do people need to be gut punched when trading stocks as a beginner in order to realize the lessons of diversification and long time horizons? Or are trading apps a net positive by helping educate traders about markets?
1840 2018-12-27 14:44:11 Without President Trumps "buy recommendation" and the treasury sec. meeting with 6 of the biggest banks on Wall Street over the weekend, yesterday would have been another day of heavy losses for stocks. Yesterdays gain was politics and Wall Street rigging exemplified.
1841 2018-12-27 14:44:11 So, when‘s a good time to buy stocks?

1850 2018-12-27 14:42:48 Is it right for the FOMC to hold off..based on perception of slowing economy when data hasn't changed?

1851 2018-12-27 14:42:36 Now doubt that short covering had something to do with yesterday's rally.  Just look at the trading of $CHK which is one of the mos heavily shorted stocks out there.

1879 2018-12-27 14:32:13 The markets were down on average abut 20% from their high. That means some stocks were significantly depressed, thus a good value for an investor with cash. Like you said, the 1% will make a ton of money on this rollercoaster of a market.

1902 2018-12-27 14:26:27 It was good that stocks had an up day yesterday, but I wonder how many Trumpers realize that when something falls 5% and then goes up 5%, it's new value is less than where it started? Plus, the market was down about 20%, so to to get back to its high, it has to go up 25%.

1907 2018-12-27 14:24:25 The @nra fought the bump stock ban just as hard as the automatic weapon ban...seriously they’re really not 2nd amendment friendly. At least automatic rifles were grandfathered in unlike bump stocks which infringes on not only the 2nd but the 4th, 5th, 6th etc amendments
1908 2018-12-27 14:23:43 Cheaper?You see that happening even though they’re already rock bottom?  US market showing a bit of life for U stocks yesterday, Canadian stocks should surely follow. The feeling of missing ‘the bottom’ is always there,especially seeing days like yesterday. I hate trading 
1909 2018-12-27 14:23:41 @BreezeBebe Just the way the stock exchange individuals make their excessive money by playing with the stock market and average citizens money.

1923 2018-12-27 14:19:44 There might be more lows, but it's better to place your buys on relative valuation of stocks than when the "bottom" is. It is very hard to get the exact bottom right. It is much easier to buy stocks when they are at a discount to their intrinsic value and keep buying lower.

1925 2018-12-27 14:19:03 Im guessing they have a separate allotment for items that they sell internationally...? Lol idk. I dont think  theyll run out of stocks tho, production is probably continuous at this point

1929 2018-12-27 14:18:30 I will stretch the rules and accept healthcare/diagnostic stocks. So you're good with qtnt.
1930 2018-12-27 14:17:46 Lots of other stocks look great but market will be choppy IMHO.  BA should be a wonderful bet for longer term.   HD and NKE will probably drop a little before rising in the shot to mid-term.
LET's SEE what this crazy market has in store.   I wond AAPL and HD and NVDA now.
1931 2018-12-27 14:17:15 He gave up some of my support when he outlawed bump stocks.
1932 2018-12-27 14:16:51 Dan, lives on Whipporwill Drive with 3 horses.

Put all their savings into pickle stocks. Can't retire.
1933 2018-12-27 14:16:44 This is a key point and one Luke Gromen has explored in depth ... Fed/gov’t has to pick which 2 of its 3 “children” to save between the dollar, Treasurys, and stocks. My belief is that they let the dollar go. (Worth noting source of UST supply you don’t mention: foreigner sales)
1934 2018-12-27 14:16:43 #Gold up a nice 10% since the summer lows - as stocks get pummelled
1935 2018-12-27 14:16:24 No shock there. But explain how #TheResistance became non-critical thinking Neocons. Then, as #MSM btmfeeds for cash/ratings, became laughing stocks following any narrative feeding the same tribal classes frothing over Obama. But #Centrist on young fella, u'll get that WW3 1day!
1936 2018-12-27 14:16:12 No idea if its a good idea to invest in the US stocks now that Trumo F*kd it up and most companies have dropped to prices not seen since 2016 ... If you buy it cheap, will it rebound into profits or will whats going on with the Gov keep the market sinking?
1937 2018-12-27 14:15:58 I hope the markets will continue to move up for some time . I will buy any dips for now $DJi #markets #NASDAQ #Stocks
1938 2018-12-27 14:15:58 most stocks on nasdaq are down 1-4% in pre-market.. have fun trading this inside day.
1939 2018-12-27 14:15:34 Consider this: bump stocks will not be a rallying cry for gun control in the Democrat house. 

He's covered an exposed flank. With a rule that can be reversed. Not that it will be, but it can.
1940 2018-12-27 14:14:46 Vous avez beaucoup de stocks dites donc :o.
1941 2018-12-27 14:14:21 It takes time for stocks to bottom. There is no quick feel good rebound back to 2800. Sorry kids. Gonna take time and progress. Best chance is earnings in Jan. Go have some fun. It ain’t going to be in the stock market short term. Be patient.

1945 2018-12-27 14:13:52 Technicians, please stop citing huge percentages of stocks below 200- and 50-day averages are reason rally won't stick. That's what the end of a bear market looks like before a new trend is confirmed. Look for divergences instead. (not a prediction of the market)
1946 2018-12-27 14:13:36 Time in the market not timing, Don’t buy managed funds - cost to high individual shares - concentrated risk. Evidenced based research buy a portfolio diversified low cost index tracking stocks & bonds, hold for long term, rebalance yearly
1947 2018-12-27 14:13:29 It could be anyone with the stocks @GEOGroup and @CoreCivic in their 401K portfolio. They donated millions to Trump and are set to profit in the BILLIONS.

1952 2018-12-27 14:11:45 Thank you CNN for taking my mind off of my falling stocks with your idiotic story about our fine young men and women in the military serving in a dangerous place.  You are the class snitch that no one likes, I see a virtual atomic wedgie in your future.
1953 2018-12-27 14:11:10 Oh!! 5. Learn Stocks!!
1954 2018-12-27 14:11:07 U.S. stocks ripped +5% yesterday and European stocks can't even budge higher. DAX and Eurostoxx 50 down 2%. Keep an eye on those markets.
1955 2018-12-27 14:10:28 I see! Hope your stocks arrive tmr! 
1956 2018-12-27 14:09:24 many supports broken in many stocks these past few weeks. this can be a nice strangle.
1957 2018-12-27 14:08:55 On a systematic historical basis claims can be a good filter for long risk trades (stocks, FX carry etc)

1962 2018-12-27 14:07:57 Un "supermarché" n'est pas 1 petit magasin & l'absence des stocks est 1 pratique courante, de même que l'erreur de prix en caisse du moins ds d'autres enseignes => 1-2€/client c'est beaucoup d'argent à la fin de la journée. 1 fois j'ai failli payer 1 oignon 2,98€, le prix au kg
1963 2018-12-27 14:07:35 Technicians, please stop citing the high number of new 52-week lows yesterday as reason the rally won't stick. The vast majority of those stocks hit new lows intraday before massive upside reversals. (Not a prediction of the market)
1964 2018-12-27 14:07:34 Jajajajaja ‘stocks o inventarios’  jajajaja de verdad está pifiado! Y lo peor es que sus seguidores hasta le creen. Mal, muy mal.
1965 2018-12-27 14:07:30 I'm glad I don't have stocks, retirement or anything else tied up with the market. Too stressful.

1967 2018-12-27 14:06:27 Well said..if you are investing in businesses not in stocks then it's a boring. Investing in businesses is not as easy as looks like a stock picking or see the blue blue channels on daily basis.

1970 2018-12-27 14:04:19 Traditionally the days immedately before and after Christmas are surprisingly enough very busy with people travelling. Unfortunately as we already operate services with every train and coach available under our existing franchise, there are no additional stocks we are able 1/2
1971 2018-12-27 14:04:06 The rally is fading today, stocks again trending down as during past several months. Even with Wed.’s gains, the S&P 500 is down 7.7% for the year, the Dow is down 7.45% and the Nasdaq is lower by 5.06%. On the whole, not a good year for anyone who ties their success to the mkts.
1972 2018-12-27 14:03:32 His gloating about the market decline was a sure buy signal. Too bad I don't trade stocks, though I have to admit, I could have put some money in index funds when he said that. Oh well. Certainly this Quoth the Rat is one of the densest market babblers out there.
1973 2018-12-27 14:03:29 With heavy heart I have to leave the conservative party.

1976 2018-12-27 14:02:49 That's very true, but we're gonna have to get a Democratic President in 2020 to remove the Federal laws concerning marijuana, before it can really take off, but once that's done, you can be sure every freaking @GOP member will own stocks in pot companies.
1977 2018-12-27 14:02:48 99% of that 38% can not afford to buy stocks...
1978 2018-12-27 14:02:39 The rally is fading today , stocks are again trending down as in the  past several months. Even with Wed.’s gains, the S&P 500 is down  7.7% for the year, the  Dow is down 7.45% and the Nasdaq is lower by  5.06%. On the whole, not a good year for Trump.
1979 2018-12-27 14:02:36 The market rebounded because of the high reported retail sales, tech stocks and the fact that Trump kept his mouth shut and Twitter thumbs in check making for a down news cycle.  It was one day and this is still the worse December since the depression.
1980 2018-12-27 14:02:20 The first answer to overbuilding and overpopulation (the cause of climate change and extinction), is taxing all stocks, property, buildings, and every child for the life of the parent; socialized education and healthcare; nature protection laws; and convicting the governments.

1993 2018-12-27 13:58:52 I also have a few stocks on watch looking to break-out but i need more confirmation from the market that this isn't a one day event. My value @ risk will be tight enough with stop-losses in place it will make taking a trade or two more reasonable.
1994 2018-12-27 13:58:49 It was not because of the FED "listening" remarks but because of Petro's tweet on stocks and inventories at 7:05 yesterday.
1995 2018-12-27 13:58:15 The Department of Justice is amending the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to clarify that bump-stock-type devices--meaning "bump fire" stocks, slide-fire devices, and devices with certain similar characteristics--are "machineguns".
1996 2018-12-27 13:58:12 The rally is fading and stocks are trending back toward the slump they've tracked for the past several months. Even with Wednesday’s gains, the S&P 500 is down 7.7% for the year, the Dow is down 7.45% and the Nasdaq is lower by 5.06%. And that is 'Aw' not 'awe.'
1997 2018-12-27 13:58:08 LOL !!!
This tweet isn’t aging well....
Trump is in Iraq visiting troops...
Wall Street just had its YUGEST one day increase EVER (1086)
BTW... the stocks didn’t start downward until the DEMS took over the house in November!!!
1998 2018-12-27 13:57:46 You very well know more than half of the people will go blindly on stuff mentioned! Stock stays up and then crashes over 50% right after the following months. And you tweet about "guys advocated stocks dumping them", can't be a greater irony than this!

2001 2018-12-27 13:56:24 A lot. @GEOGroup and @CoreCivic donated millions to Trump and that is paying off nicely. Check your 401K and see if your funds carry those stocks.
2002 2018-12-27 13:56:13 Hey @KindaFunnyKevin I was wondering if you is a particular app for your stocks?
2003 2018-12-27 13:55:55 I believe that are too many teams who are over coached now and keep on doing the same thing when it is not working and can not within the team change the way they play themselves during a game
2004 2018-12-27 13:55:54 The answer to overbuilding and overpopulation, is taxing stocks, property, buildings, and every child for the life of the parent; socialized education and healthcare; nature protection laws; and convicting the Electoral college, S.Delegates, Lobbyists, Supreme Court, etc.
2005 2018-12-27 13:55:03 Looking at the charts of gold and stocks in the past, my interpretation is that there is a lag between when stocks decline and when gold starts to move up.  Your thoughts?
2006 2018-12-27 13:54:58 Pure anecdata but Trump popularity didn’t change much during the Jan selloff, I don’t think. Selloffs absent real Econ effects are rare but my non-rigorous vibe is that voters care little—too few own stocks, etc.
2007 2018-12-27 13:54:12 And the majority of traded stocks were from computer -generated transactions. SMH
2008 2018-12-27 13:53:21 When people who don’t understand politics say how great things are going. Yeah tell that to my stocks and retirement fund that has had the worst year since our recession. Such a great thing going on

2018 2018-12-27 13:48:38 The top of 1300 on the RUT hasn’t been violated yet & the mid & small caps in RUT are the weakest stocks.  Until 1300 is decisively violated, I think it is premature to call a bear market in the US.
2019 2018-12-27 13:47:36 As long as the pullback is not too large, this is constructive action. Why? Gives us the opportunity to buy more IF we take out yesterdays' highs. And, we we have a nice, select, shopping list! #stocks
2020 2018-12-27 13:47:14 People seem to miss this... A couple of dozen people control the majority of the wealth of the world. The stock market goes up and down based on what people buy or sell. Any one of the top wealth hoarders can manipulate stocks at will by buying and selling.

The most common comment I get is 'Don't you read the paper?!' Because if you read the paper, there's no way you'd buy these stocks.
2023 2018-12-27 13:44:48 C'est pas une histoire de "team premier degrés" mais certaines personnes pourrait se dépêcher de commander avant une potentiel "rupture des stocks" et s'apercevoir, chez eux, que c'est de la fausse RAM ^^

2044 2018-12-27 13:36:18 Yes, you can even offset gains from other investments like stocks. Keep in mind this applies to US only, not sure about tax laws in other countries. Also IANAA, DYOR or consult a CPA like @vandrewattycpa or @CryptoTaxGirl.

2049 2018-12-27 13:33:13 Those 38% are also the people who bought stocks yesterday since Trump told them to buy. When they'll lose money they'll blame the ones whom Trump blames but they would never blame themselves or their Supreme Leader.

2057 2018-12-27 13:30:18 Hopefully stocks will continue to drop for you. Do you have a certain price your willing to buy $Googl?
2058 2018-12-27 13:29:09 Surely the financial debt scheme we have here since 1970s is unsustainable over long term. But really hard to set the end date... plus the end game normally looks like hyperinflation with skyrocketing stocks/hard assets. I wouldnt really think about heavy stocks drop.
2059 2018-12-27 13:29:08 Lol  no it did not. Stocks are down but so are gas prices. The economy is still doing pretty good & companies are still spending a lot of money on big projects.
2060 2018-12-27 13:28:46 why would it happen? Inv buy on future earnings expectations. What data in US or global confirms it? Corps are guiding earn lower. Inv are used to chasing chart patterns for 9 year but but none of the factors that drove stocks b4 exist. Germany/Jap have nearly flat 10 year yield
2061 2018-12-27 13:28:43 I agree we need more POC in professional and skilled careers.

When we speak about wealth = assets -debt.
Which has less to do with income and everything to do with generational asset transfers. I.E. Inherited Home equity, stocks, and other assets.

2077 2018-12-27 13:18:08 $GLD a lot of technical peps pointing for a downward trend ahead. Quite possible but lets not forget January is coming and that is a great time for metals. With political risk still looming and stocks heading to bear territory I would be hesitant to pull out of a long position
2078 2018-12-27 13:17:27 I still have funds in the money market.  Still too risky to jump back into stocks.  I think there's more trouble ahead.  A 1000 point DOW gain after a 5000 point drop is expected.   Bargain shoppers.  I'm waiting for what the market calls capitulation.  Then I'll jump back in.
2079 2018-12-27 13:17:05 How do your articles on $gern compare to the reality of their trial results?  Your “prediction” only happened due to a massive market correction, especially in biotech stocks, that almost perfectly conincided with the disappointing $JNJ decision.  #blindsquirrel

2083 2018-12-27 13:15:18 Knowledge and Patience

"The essentials to stock market success are knowledge and patience." Jesse Livermore in book:  How to trade in Stocks. 

Very valuable advice in the current market situation.
2084 2018-12-27 13:15:17 I bet they are shorting stocks like never before.
2085 2018-12-27 13:15:01 I see a lot of people saying that tripping didn't make them lose that many stocks so it wasn't that bad. Sure as hell you didn't you either didn't run or was in the air constantly with Metaknight. That's the point. You can't run and in general move as freely in brawl
2086 2018-12-27 13:14:32 Few "call"stocks based on intellectual research that is measured like u do.
2087 2018-12-27 13:14:18 Magnesia con gimnasia...

Stocks se refiere a acciones no a inventarios (muestra gráfica S&P) 

Si fueran inventarios y estos bajan es síntoma de mayor demanda lo cual sería positivo.
2088 2018-12-27 13:12:46 I’m glad about that & like everyone else fear the inevitable law of Wall Street stocks, that is: what goes up will eventually come down!

   No, the stock market didn't disappear during the housing crisis starting in 2007. Investors simply sold off for liquidity.
  Unemployment is low. Very solid.
2134 2018-12-27 12:48:13 I don’t think either will happen. I think they’ll head quietly 2 the electoral gallows.

2143 2018-12-27 12:43:39 Haha. But joking aside, if order size is below a certain level, it's not worth them gunning for. And for liquid assets like the major futures or stocks, that threshold is quite high

There are many good stocks which are trading at very rich valuations.

# stock prices could remain flat for the next 3-4 years and earnings could catch up

# stock prices could correct 

Note - 4 years are nothing in a long term portfolio.

2150 2018-12-27 12:39:12 U r right sir and am aware. Reason I asked is in my 24 months of writing experience, esp stocks have given me lots of heart burns. And there I agree with Sundar sir  approach to always hedge positional trade, even if it means less credit. Your views in India context.?
2151 2018-12-27 12:38:58 Found @Raamdeo's interview most candid. Big drawdowns, not selling to avoid capital gains, selling sin stocks at cost, over confidence in IT. Everything that a novice investor does. Kudos for your honesty @masterclass_si

2156 2018-12-27 12:36:45 .@charliebilello You have done extraordinarily good decile studies of about what happens to fwd returns of stocks at various curve levels and at various levels of employment.  Both are at or close to worst deciles.  Any chance we could get a combo study?
2157 2018-12-27 12:36:36 i was thinking the same thing, people might think that this is an inverted H&S but volume is getting weaker. Right now money is flowing into stocks. Bitcoin has just started to capitulate, 3150$ was the preliminary sell off... still 18 months more for next halving

2173 2018-12-27 12:32:02 Sorry, I disagree about bump stocks.  It essentially changes a semiauto to a full auto (even if it is slow).  Full auto has been prohibited for decades.

2180 2018-12-27 12:27:58 stock tip: whenever you see the headline " __________ stocks to buy in 2019". Don't even read it.  This is someone trying to steal your money.
2181 2018-12-27 12:27:37 Not only that,  but it's not true, & the only reason there was a "gain" to begin with was because stocks fell so much.

2189 2018-12-27 12:23:48 Reasons to be bearish on stocks:

1. Government shutdown 

2. Tariffs at 10% (soon to be 25%)

3. Hawkish Fed

4. Global slowdown 

Reasons to be bullish:

1. Hope*

2. Steven Mnuchin**

*Hope is not a strategy.

**Steven Mnuchin has no idea what he’s doing.

2195 2018-12-27 12:21:28 Despite yesterday's rally, Fed chairman is still in power. So, the threats for higher rates and continued b/s normalization will continue...

Any further decrease in household value (housing, stocks) will dramatically worsen consumer spending/investment (70% of GDP).
2196 2018-12-27 12:20:58 Is the goldilock's stock market back? I doubt it. What must be recognized is no one predicted this 1000 point rise in the Dow.

2203 2018-12-27 12:17:29 To partly explain Wednesday's market surge: U.S. defined-benefit pensions fund needed to implement a giant re-balancing out of bonds & into stocks the biggest in history,near $64 billion in equity purchases to be made in the last trading days of Q4 & year.

2209 2018-12-27 12:15:20 Well, if you would've invested in stocks it would've helped you 

Anyhow, my point is that while the Democrats were bashing Trump yesterday because of the 600 point drop they've just ignored today's surge which was almost double.
2210 2018-12-27 12:15:16 Today, whale stocks are carefully monitored, and while many species are still endangered, others - like the minke whale that Japan primarily hunts - are not.
2211 2018-12-27 12:15:15 Keeping the costs on Sisters artificially high reduces sales of small stocks and offsets the cost of small casting runs, while keeping them technically available until the plastics launch.

2214 2018-12-27 12:14:55 What is the current whaling ban?
In 1986, IWC members agreed to a moratorium on hunting to allow stocks to recover.
Pro-whaling nations expected the moratorium to be temporary, until consensus could be reached on sustainable catch quotas.

In this market, mutual fund is probably a persons best bet. Can still Pick one with things that interest you
2291 2018-12-27 11:28:16 Me too, I only do the ice thing when I already have some stock in the freezer. And then I use the gelatin left over to body up other stocks where clarity isn't important
2292 2018-12-27 11:27:36 METALS, STOCKS, CRYPTOS, CASH. ALL MANIPULATED. Decades of hard work, makibg ends meet, reading, sacrifice, years of smart investments, sacrificing personal pleasure for family & future of children. None of it matters?! LIFE STOLEN. Will any of my stolen life EVER be returned?
2293 2018-12-27 11:26:39 That indexing stocks like #SPY #ETF puts you at risk of a run on the bank, but that owning #BTC means you can control your own asset class hedge.
2294 2018-12-27 11:26:23 KSE-100 down 364 points to 37853; KSE-100 Index declined 364.50 points to close at 37853.57, 97 stocks closed up 232 closed down while 22 stocks remained unchanged. Volume Bank Alfalah Limited closed at Rs 43.87 down Rs 2.29
2295 2018-12-27 11:25:45 I might just tip over the entry level including stocks and bonuses.
2296 2018-12-27 11:25:31 Well, the Brits can take "revenge" by asking for asylum in France, once the rat burger stocks runs out in Brexitannia. Hope the French will treat the Brits as well as the Home Office treated migrants.

2298 2018-12-27 11:24:02 Quite true, @TIA_Investors doing a fair job as far as we have seen.
Also it is wrong to think a investment association group can rig stocks . How is it even possible (esp In stocks with MCap > 1000 cr)?
2299 2018-12-27 11:23:46 Let's see. Ask and be accepted, pretty much fully compliant and with discussions re access to fish stocks in our allocated waters.

2303 2018-12-27 11:21:09 March 3 of 2009 Obama also said to buy stocks. Similar to what Trump did this week before the Dow went up 1000 points.
2304 2018-12-27 11:21:01 Because Obama never falsely took ownership of how stocks were doing claiming it was all because of him.
2305 2018-12-27 11:20:57 Gutted that Puxton Farm Shop no longer stocks @MilesTeaCoffee. Only sells clipper and teapigs. Nonsense. Will have to order online instead 
2306 2018-12-27 11:19:59 Or it’s like family buying stocks in the company that is you and your parents have a certain authority over you because they’ve invested the most money in you. They all do this to fund your successful future so they may get something in return when that future comes.

2309 2018-12-27 11:19:02 The key parameters involved in Peter Lynch’s ‘two minute drill’ are:

1. P/E Ratio: avoid stocks with excessively high P/E
2. Debt/Equity Ratio:should be low
3. Net Cash per Share: should be high
4. Dividend & Payout Ratio: should be adequate
5. Inventory levels: lower the better

My dear Patriots, this day is a perfect day to invest. Buy stocks cos the market will rise extremely, of iets van deze strekking.

2323 2018-12-27 11:12:31 Hi Phillip! As of April 2018 you are able to have both a stocks & shares ISA and a help to buy ISA (a type of cash ISA). You can split your £20,000 tax-free allowance per year how you choose!

2325 2018-12-27 11:11:46 Stocks have not recovered you nut.
2326 2018-12-27 11:11:37 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temperatures and when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. Stocks do the same.

2346 2018-12-27 10:55:01 Tenure is but a dream. Especially as stocks tank and kill retirement accounts. Profs just don’t go emeritus or retire.

2351 2018-12-27 10:52:44 World stocks bounced off a near 2-year low Thursday, lifted by a dramatic Wall Street surge, though a fall in Chinese industrial profits and renewed Italian banking worries offered a sobering reminder of the problems weighing on the world economy.

2357 2018-12-27 10:50:46 Well, this is initially the same premise of mine back in July '17.

If expanding the #fed balance was seen as inflationary (as roc of asset rose so did yields and stocks) then is it out of the realm of possibility was unwinding would be disinflationary?

2358 2018-12-27 10:50:41 Pretty much agree. Though both Huws and Adeyemi’s stocks will also be low because of their injury records. Also, I think a fit Huws, especially, will be a massive boost to the team. Agree re Knudsen, I get the impression he’s halfway out the door already.

SINGAPORE (AP) - An incredible day on Wall Street, where major indexes finished at least 5 percent higher, lifted Japanese stocks Thursday, but received a mixed reaction in Asia.

2364 2018-12-27 10:44:16 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
2365 2018-12-27 10:41:53 It’s a correction to a fluctuation. This is the logic of the markets. To have significant news have no effect in stocks, or the opposite effect, would be crazy. (The President’s declaration that the Fed chairman’s job is safe caused the normalization.)
2366 2018-12-27 10:39:34 Hi, what is the technical indicator you use to identify stocks. Nitin was hovering around that level for long time, but you identified when it's ready to move.
2367 2018-12-27 10:39:29 Hahaha, this is why I'm not a very good investor. B/c I'm a trader, I realize the strong overall correlation between the market and the vast majority of stocks, hence I can't hold through market pullbacks that I see coming. The trader in me is much stronger than the investor.

2372 2018-12-27 10:35:36 3. See the following rules-of-thumb, published by respected experts, on allocating between stocks and bonds given your specific financial situation.
2373 2018-12-27 10:34:50 My shortlist (from a similar blogpost I wrote, which will also live forever as an unpublished draft):
1. It's hard to beat the market. If you're reading this, you probably can't beat the market.
2. So invest in low-cost index fund, which index stocks and bonds.

2519 2018-12-27 08:34:01 Bump stocks are a fun thing, nothing more. The bump stock probably limited casualties since it makes you miss the majority of your shots, yes you can shoot a bit faster, but it throws your aim, especially at that range.

2636 2018-12-27 07:03:09 Exactly. The stocks dropped yet JFC is not doing anything.

2637 2018-12-27 07:01:57 Yes, it would. So your premise is pointless and nothing but using a tragedy for political gains.

And the ban on bump-stocks will have no effect on such tragedies.

2644 2018-12-27 06:57:56 To expand, why do want to give up more of your freedoms for a false sense of safety. Bedroom dressers are proven to kill more people than bump stocks. Why don't you regulate them?

2647 2018-12-27 06:55:14 An incredible day on Wall Street, where major indexes finished at least 5 percent higher, lifted Japanese stocks but received a mixed reaction in Asia on Thursday as some traders returned from a Christmas break.

70 (stocks), 10 (world large), 10 (cash) 10 (small + intl). 

So glad to find another passive investor. Used to do futures, but way to stressful.

2651 2018-12-27 06:52:24 This is nonsense. Interest in stocks is the same as interest in the company. Shareholders have a massive economic interest in making the company successful.

2654 2018-12-27 06:50:13 When you have a massive defence infrastructure like China, replenishing stocks isn’t a problem. That’s what Mr. Sawhney is talking about.
2655 2018-12-27 06:49:51 The counter argument is that global stocks were falling on the tariffs but the US was insulated by the shot of heroin coming from the tax cuts.  Now the marginal benefits were subsiding and the US is catching up.  I know you know this thesis but it's worth noting.
2656 2018-12-27 06:47:44 Buy stocks low and at the dip and ride them up as they recover. Every great investor tells you this. It doesn't make sense to but when the markets are at all time highs or when they're doing good. Most of you will disregard this advice and regret it later I promise. #PayYourself
2657 2018-12-27 06:46:00 what’s the point of doing no-buy 2019 when you’re having last minute impulsive purchases for the remaining days of 2018, your justification being the fear of running out of back-up stocks? you’re beyond stupid!

2659 2018-12-27 06:42:41 Would love to see who actually picked up all the lowered stocks on the DOW on 26th - most likely the rich now just getting richer, on the backs of others who had to sell-off their stocks.

2768 2018-12-27 05:18:44 My uncle took offense to me calling Trump the Antichrist at Christmas, and countered with how great his stocks are doing. Like yeah, tell the kids in cages how great your fucking stocks are, idiot.
2769 2018-12-27 05:18:23 Things like summer package, season greetings, memories they wouldn't restock those when they sold out..they nvr will m nvr did. The only way for u to get it is by searching for other store that actually hv left over stocks or rejection items or used one.

5. Beyond grotesque to blame cpb for those deaths
2783 2018-12-27 05:10:10 The Democrats can not accept that Trump is not 100% conservative. Tariffs, ban on bump stocks, calling out members of his own party etc I should really change my name because I am fully behind Trump who does not take crap from the establishment of either party.
2784 2018-12-27 05:09:56 That's a large percentage if you compare it to bump stocks I guess.
2785 2018-12-27 05:09:42 So no credit to the report that consumers spent 800 million on gifts that helped boost confidence in the economy. Which in turn boosted stocks?

2799 2018-12-27 05:01:09 The dollar held on to most of its overnight gains on Thursday as investors cheered signs of easing U.S.-Sino trade tensions and stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data, sending Wall Street stocks surging and Treasury yields up.

2808 2018-12-27 04:55:14 TWN Stocks: I kept mentioning Taiwan Styrene Monomer (1310 台苯), which is down over 8% as we speak.    Someone has been walking this stock up for over 9 months, and nearly all of those bought shares are underwater after today.   In other words, fucked.   And deservedly so.
2809 2018-12-27 04:54:21 People sell their stocks when they gain value, the price of the stock then goes down. Life is funny like that.

2821 2018-12-27 04:48:06 #MSNBC  Trump as president knows his statements have a major effect on stock market.  He purposely says something to drive the market down.

2829 2018-12-27 04:40:26 Ufff “stocks o inventarios” acaba de meter la palabra stocks en google translate. Es muy ignorante.
2830 2018-12-27 04:39:49 You walk away when up. It's like in stocks when the market gives you a gift -- take it !!
2831 2018-12-27 04:38:58 Watch the video when you google cramer market manpulation. He causes the pumping and dumping of stocks. Poor people listen to him, buy a stock which he claims will run to the moon and then he sells and the poor person is left holding it one stock he recommended went bankrupt
2832 2018-12-27 04:38:27 Shorting can be done but it's a tough game.  You have the drift, carrying costs, and the fact that stocks go up more slowly and over longer periods than meaningfully down.  Timing is critical, and when stocks do go down, they don't go quietly. A lot of gyrations and whip-saw.
2833 2018-12-27 04:38:02 That is correct. For 9 years through January markets rose in straight line. I'm a simpleton who keeps bubblevision on mute & believes liquidity drives stocks. The abundance of liquidity ensured a smooth ride. You can answer your question re: stocks fate by following the liquidity
2834 2018-12-27 04:37:57 Just invested in some stocks! 
2835 2018-12-27 04:37:39 Okay.  So a recession hits.  Stocks down 50% and therefore investments are locked in.  

Let’s say a Single mom of two kids doesn’t sell because she’s down 50%, so she thinks...what are her options?  To sell her house

Opendoor can do in minutes. Or wait 90 days w tanking economy
2836 2018-12-27 04:36:38 The bank bailouts. Billions missing from said bailouts. Green energy scandal Robert Kaiser Foundation invested in solar. Feinstein, Pelosi, Boehner, other Obama donors all bought stocks in solar. Stocks soared, they sold making millions while tax payers footed the bill.

2840 2018-12-27 04:36:00 10year treasury yields have come back down and with inflation low that should put rate hikes on hold and is support for stocks unless in the short term until rates come up again.

2842 2018-12-27 04:33:51 Wonder if Fed convened emergency meeting tonight? Must be plotting with George Soros, Tom Steyer & Chinese govt how to destroy stocks tomorrow.

2843 2018-12-27 04:32:02 Ok ok, if you insist I will buy some more $FCAU tomorrow. 

So many options on sale right now... despite the S&P 500 being down by 20% (before today), many stocks have dropped 25 - 50%.
2844 2018-12-27 04:31:39 All stocks I track had about average volume, so the bounce is suspect, to say the least

2849 2018-12-27 04:29:57 I hoee you don't go into a career in finance when you assert that stocks going up weeks after the election is due to the election
2850 2018-12-27 04:29:50 You leave the country and don't tweet for a day and the stocks go up!  lololol!  I see your good buddy, Jeff Bezos, and Amazon sales are part of the reason.  Then the assurance by Hassett that you're not firing Powell.  You'll probably do it anyhow though.  You are that stupid.
2851 2018-12-27 04:29:36 he 1984 not-quite-a-bear-market-bottom was very reminiscent of 1984. Stocks sold off, gained, sold off, gained, sold off again, and gained again. Textbook, really.  1984 1984? Typo?
2852 2018-12-27 04:29:27 It’s a simple stupid trick to manage stops on buys and opening shorts on the weak. Can use it with stocks as well just AH and PM price balanced with RTH.
2853 2018-12-27 04:29:23 499 of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 rose on Wednesday. Shame on you, Newmont Mining. Shame on you, $NEM.

2855 2018-12-27 04:28:17 The stocks are just on sale!
2856 2018-12-27 04:27:05 Almost as if even in high beta names there is a component of decay in stocks as if they were leveraged instruments. The 115 point rally represented 1/5 of the total decline, but portfolio only recouped 1/15th or implied loss during the downturn
2857 2018-12-27 04:26:55 We should put a sales tax on stocks to reduce high freuency trading because that destabilizes our economy.
2858 2018-12-27 04:26:50 I feel as though if Zephiel used me as a fighter, he’d make me jump off the ledge until I ran out of stocks.

2860 2018-12-27 04:25:41 Apparently stocks came back ‘cause some of you guys spent 850 billion this holiday season.

Unfortunately none of it was on health care or affordable housing for people in these winter months.

2862 2018-12-27 04:24:58 Today, the stock market did very well, which of course is thanks to our Omnipotent Overlord Trump. However, when stocks go down, it's somebody else's fault!
2863 2018-12-27 04:24:57 Glad to see children getting killed is a joke. All for guns the NRA and Donald Trump, but you are pretty ridiculous with some of the shit you say.

2866 2018-12-27 04:23:09 #Stocks,#Indexes Weak signals notwithstanding, or perhaps because of them and the way this rally got underway nonetheless, and off the bear market borderline to boot, suggests strongly the rally has begun that will convince at the conscious level it was all just a correction...
2867 2018-12-27 04:23:05 It would appear so. Look at Palantir, where'd Thiel get all his data? He has a defense contract if I'm not mistaken. I know he cozied up to DT n put in a bid to DoD. They're selling us like stocks, mining out special interests for target ad's etc not to mention Big brother. 
2868 2018-12-27 04:23:01 Just remember... indicators lag price.

Lots of stocks sold off to close just below the 8 EMA today and volume was anemic.

Not bullish.
2869 2018-12-27 04:22:54 The best place to go from here is the realignment of the stock market. Achieved by time locking stocks, all stock to be held for a minimum of 12 months.  End rapid trade

2871 2018-12-27 04:19:09 So the Fed raises interest rates, driving stocks downward on the news, and the next thing ya know, old Chucky @SenSchumer is out there blaming @realDonaldTrump for the bad economic news. And of course stocks rebounded today, but Chucky's been real quiet about that.

2883 2018-12-27 04:11:16 Everybody please understand the stock market pretty much crashed that means stocks and funds are selling at a discounted price. Take advantage of it now or regret it later. Talk to me if you want to know more. I don't sell stocks or anything but i can point you the right way.

Hence leading indicator. 2017 risk on year, 2018 is risk off, and asset price will cooloff thanks to the Fed
2890 2018-12-27 04:07:50 Bump stocks are worthless anyway. Just use your belt loop.

2894 2018-12-27 04:05:30 It's going back up again.  If you knew anything about stocks, you buy when they're down and sell when the price goes up.

3003 2018-12-27 03:24:56 Investing is generally just buying in and leaving it for years, far different than the lottery. There is no way to predict the future so any other method is the same as gambling & usually loses. It is better just to buy undervalued stocks or dividend stocks & hold them for years

When they are happy n have ample buyers, they quote exorbitant price. On the other hand when they panic and have fewer buyers they sell same stocks at throw away price. Investors should enter this room during panic to get a good bargin.

3009 2018-12-27 03:21:17 Because you don't have stocks.  Dow is still down 2000 pts from a month ago.  Leave the adults to discuss economics silly child.
3010 2018-12-27 03:21:11 Today Hot Stocks: Sun Pharma, NTPC, Tata Global, Cimmco, Titagarh Wagons, HUL.
3011 2018-12-27 03:21:01 Monday you were in complete panic mode saying you were basically out of stocks. Today biggest day in years. Just saying.
3012 2018-12-27 03:20:54 serious question: after such oversold conditions, what is the need to pick individual stocks vs trading $SPY in this environment? the index itself rose 5 % today...you want more beta ?
3013 2018-12-27 03:20:38 They can keep pumping air in the balloon as long as they want. In the end, higher they go, harder they fall. A time comes when either the stocks have to be sacrificed or the fiat's value goes down the drain. Guess what, second scenario has been happening all over the world
3014 2018-12-27 03:20:05 "more than 500 stocks in the S&P 500" ?
3015 2018-12-27 03:19:29 If Nifty 50 can have 51 stocks why can't 500 have 505

3035 2018-12-27 03:08:36 How did you get that from what I said  first, this is about the stock market not the economy. Second, stocks went up for 8 years under Obama. Then they went up for one year under Trump, and now are down in his second year. I hope this is just a blip, but it may just be starting

3061 2018-12-27 02:55:11 omg i thought this said stocks -
3062 2018-12-27 02:55:05 The market rebounded because of the high reported retail sales, tech stocks and the fact that Trump kept his mouth shut and Twitter thumbs in check making for a down news cycle.  It was one day and this is still the worse December since the depression.
3063 2018-12-27 02:54:28 It finished green.  But with that aside, people need to do what’s best for them. If it’s too sketchy, they shouldn’t enter. Way too many other stocks out there to explore.

3099 2018-12-27 02:38:07 I disagree with the @ATFHQ ‘s ruling at @realDonaldTrump ‘s behest. The definition of machine gun is a mechanical description, its precedence as “firing more than a single shot by a single function of the trigger.” Via 27CFR 479.11. Bump stocks do not make semi-guns machine guns.

3127 2018-12-27 02:25:05 What wil media headlines look like tomorrow? Stocks up all-time record 1000+ points...and @realDonaldTrump visits troops in Iraq & gets hero's welcome. Think NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, MSNBC, HuffPost, NY Times, WashPost will report facts? #NEVER
3128 2018-12-27 02:24:36 Bottles of beer on a wall... somewhere. Like, seriously, where IS this mythological wall that stocks peoples' collections of beer bottles, and WHY are you just storing your beer there? That's not climate controlled. #WeirdThingsToHaveAHundredOf
3129 2018-12-27 02:24:24 Fantastic material, @ScottyMarkets! I agree---great buying opportunity in many growth stocks. Sell-off was way over done. You watch the technicals, you know. Good stuff, @KennedyNation! @FoxBusiness
3130 2018-12-27 02:24:15 There's a way the investor expresses fear:
By dumping their stocks. (That's our premise here.)
When he's tweeting, they sold,
But then they grew bold,
When they found out Trump just left our hemisphere.
3131 2018-12-27 02:23:16 I don't really care for bump stocks but the government doing this is just another chunk taken from of the 2nd amendment chuck here chuck there before you know it it's gone.
3132 2018-12-27 02:23:08 Just as an FYI, those no one follows the cash markets in China, they have daily trading volume about 8x the stock market and are probably the best indicator of any asset flows in China from commodities, stocks, and real estate. So yes, them jumping to 9% is important
3133 2018-12-27 02:22:46 How many stocks are in the Dow Jones Industrial Average?
3134 2018-12-27 02:22:41 #ResignTrump #frankRich @David_Feldman_ #JeremyShamos Trump leaves U.S.A.  Stocks rise.
3135 2018-12-27 02:22:18 I was sooo hoping my commissions check would had kicked in before this happened. Everyone panicking and I am here thinking of things to pawn so I can buy some of these stocks. Lol
3136 2018-12-27 02:21:57 Oiga Genio, stocks son ACCIONES, no sea tan bruto!!
3137 2018-12-27 02:21:08 Any tips for some stocks ?
3138 2018-12-27 02:20:55 Amazing buying opportunities. Stocks are dirt cheap and will rally to new all time highs. Bonds Yield 2.7-3% and are fixed. Stocks pay 5.6% in Earnings power and are growing at 8%. What would you rather have, a 2.9% Bond or a 11% Yield in a decade? Not for the faint of 
3139 2018-12-27 02:20:45 So you reading a penny stock course and you’re buying stocks @ $15? I call bullshit

3142 2018-12-27 02:17:44 Hearsay.. PROOVE it.. as my JOURNALISM proof told me if you do not have FACTS to substantiate your piece you have nothing to report.. what ever happened to journalistic integrity!
3143 2018-12-27 02:17:23 @AmericanVoterUS tje workers has no power there boss at the top get get big deals stocks buy backs and you say the u.s.a is great
3144 2018-12-27 02:16:03 Stocks gain largests rally, news saying it's end of the decline. I'm not sure though. After all 2018 was a totally unusual year in the market.
3145 2018-12-27 02:15:41 Many permabulls/bears who continue to guess, and are loaded up only one way. Timing and predicting are a tough thing to do, but I'll tell you what has worked perfectly through this volatility in the market collapse, 50% growth oriented stocks, 50% gold miners. 1/2
3146 2018-12-27 02:15:08 Best number of stocks
3147 2018-12-27 02:15:07 Know wonder stocks sored! Canes in the house! 
3148 2018-12-27 02:14:58 This down turn is just a test for the 2020 election.  It worked!  Just wait until the summer of 2020 we will have the biggest drop in stocks since the great depression. It’s all about the vote and the swamp wants #POTUSTrump OUT.

i took multiple stocks by walking slowly of your range it's not my fault that's funny
3151 2018-12-27 02:14:05 How many stocks are in the Russell 2000?
3152 2018-12-27 02:13:59 For the first time on record, more than 500 of the S&P500 stocks finished in the green according to Bloomberg data; specifically 99.8% of stocks advanced
3153 2018-12-27 02:13:41 Both of those groups...and those of us with 401ks or other retirement funds, stocks or bonds, a car, land or other property... bring the median up, compared to people who rent and live paycheck to paycheck without much in savings if anything.
3154 2018-12-27 02:13:22 You can't handle the truth. You respond with your feelings and applaud the stupid D-Lister on Christmas blathering pure hate. 

Stocks made a 10 year all-time gain today. Because of Main St. not Wall St. You haven't figured out a single thing in this exchange.
3155 2018-12-27 02:13:21 1) One up on wall street
2) Common stocks & uncommon profits.
Lot of good takeouts
3156 2018-12-27 02:13:11 MY FAVOURITE is MILKA ALPINE MILK. Strangely it's never advertised and usually stocks are gone and replaced by other Milka products which sell slower. Staff in shops where I have asked say they dont know, so I must assume it's some form of subterfuge by Mondelez to keep it secret
3157 2018-12-27 02:12:32 @POTUS Trump, terrible disservice to American investors today! Told them to by low when a crash worse that 08 is very near! We know our economy is strong, but it’s only 25% of world economy. The other 75% is on verge of worst collapse in history. U got CEO’s to buy their stocks!
3158 2018-12-27 02:12:15 BBCNEWS 6:07pm US STOCKS RALLY. Dow Jones up by more than 1,OOO points US STOCKS RALLY. Dow Jones sets record for single trading...
3159 2018-12-27 02:12:10 It is the CNBC app. Pretty good for US stocks.
3160 2018-12-27 02:11:53 #Stocks,#Indexes How will this end? Keep an open mind. A bear market rally, like any rally, can be followed by decline or: after a brief pullback, another bottom signal, and rally. The market can do anything . . . almost.
3161 2018-12-27 02:11:50 Me: Man my stocks had a bad week
Family: because democrats won the house
Me: *actively looks for new family who reads the news*
3162 2018-12-27 02:11:48 Thursday's S&P range of 161 points, wow. On Oct 5, 1984, the price of the entire S&P index was 161. Think of that increase, 1400% in 34 years. Just makes one realize there's a reason that short sellers of stocks all wear scuffed shoes and have frayed collars.
3163 2018-12-27 02:11:19 505 stocks.  Out of which 504 rose on Wednesday & one fell
3164 2018-12-27 02:11:12 One of the craziest days in stocks across the board tho.

TSLA is a ticking bomb.
3165 2018-12-27 02:10:59 He’s the most comfortable for me, and extremely fun, but Im giving up hope on him. I lost most of my stocks sub 50-60 because somebody forced me offstage and got a random spike on me, without me having a consistent kill setup
3166 2018-12-27 02:10:19 I think the biggest headline in stocks was general electric getting kicked out of the dow 30 like it is Eastman Kodak or something
3167 2018-12-27 02:09:41 You had to know this way coming...

3174 2018-12-27 02:05:24 Trump left the country so he couldn't tweet today and the stocks went up. He opens jhis mouth tomorrow and down they go again

3180 2018-12-27 02:03:39 Dow up 5% and people freak. 

That’s why I advise day traders to trade crypto. You get 5%-10% swings daily and sometimes hourly. 

Who gives a shit that most of it’s worthless. So are most stocks. Shhh don’t tell anyone.
3181 2018-12-27 02:03:37 The S&P 500 stock market index, maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, comprises 505 common stocks issued by 500 large-cap companies and traded on American stock exchanges, and covers about 80 percent of the American equity market by capitalization.

3182 2018-12-27 02:03:29 Real True News, Pesident Trump and Flotus visit troops in Iran for Christmas also visiting other troops, sooo MSM put that in your pipe and smoke it ! Also stocks finished higher than ever 
3183 2018-12-27 02:03:15 Pump and dump. All your picks go down 70%. You pick illiquid stocks like LPTX AVDL. 

You won’t show proof of “million dollar portfolio.”
3184 2018-12-27 02:03:02 I think he paid a lot of people a lot of money for the stocks to spring back ... anything to make the moron seem good 
3185 2018-12-27 02:02:09 Stocks rise when @paulafaris tweets. Especially at me 
3186 2018-12-27 02:02:05 You give mr. Trump way too much credit for things that have happened, just like him. The world  bank is in control of the stock market by virtue of owning lots of stocks and insurance companies. The Kurds are only defending their opium, the French Foreign Legion did in Vietnam.
3187 2018-12-27 02:02:05 Flat yield curves and full employment (<4.5%) are very, very rare.  In the last 18 years we had it for basically six months: first half of 2007.  Before that was first half of 2000.  That combination has historically been incredibly toxic to stocks.
3188 2018-12-27 02:01:55 Nope if Dems weren't taking over in Jan we wouldn't be in the shape we're in on stocks, Trump has done more in 2yrs that the last 4 Pres have done their whole time. Being you voted dem then you don't mind throwing money away bc that's what you did

3192 2018-12-27 01:59:21 Thanks for acknowledging the fact of dumping stocks  sweet sugar !
3193 2018-12-27 01:58:51 She just can’t resist showing America how ignorant she is.  Did you notice that her President supported banning bump stocks and she doesn’t say a word about him or ask for his departure.
3194 2018-12-27 01:56:37 Let's just say I didn't have the money to buy Google, Amazon, or Netflix stocks during their early IPO days. Facebook... I wasn't very sure about the fundamentals, so I would have missed that boat. However, now I have the funds and XRP is a helluva deal right now, IMO! 
3195 2018-12-27 01:56:09 El presidente del gobierno alterno confunde la bolsa de valores con los inventarios.

Wey pa que te enteres: cuando Krugman habla de stocks, se refiere a el mercado de capitales y no a la reserva en bodega.

Increíble que aún haya gente votando por éste estúpido
3196 2018-12-27 01:55:23 I HATE it when they say "stocks fell because of XXXXXX" They and we have no idea
3197 2018-12-27 01:55:23 Kaitlin Bennett--instead of this tasteless video in which you encourage people to break the law, how about you provide a rational argument for why bump stocks should stay legal?
3198 2018-12-27 01:55:01 Hmmm... I’m happy he banned bump stocks. So good job there.
3199 2018-12-27 01:53:32 Why give Republicans credit for Obama's surge? The last Obama budget expired last year. Then, Republiconomics. Like everyone who pays attention, I'd long predicted Republicanomics' to kick down this year. It did. 
FWIW, I expected US stocks to take their first big hit earlier.

3201 2018-12-27 01:52:59 The biggest blunder i saw happen thro 2018 in #markets is people mistook #multibaggers for #compounders.

Most lost their shirt. Interestingly, guys who advocated the stocks dumped them.

We don't discover great stocks. The more we try, the more we will go wrong.

#Indiastrategy
3202 2018-12-27 01:52:41 The sad part is the brainwashed democratic voters that only voted bc they hate Trump and can't see how well this country was doing, they only slowed this country down and probably don't own any stocks
3203 2018-12-27 01:52:09 Estas peor que maburro!! Stocks son acciones! No inventario.  Y se dice experto en economía. Como dice un conocido, callado se ve mas bonito
3204 2018-12-27 01:51:58 Obama never ran a dang thing except a community center. Puppet of the globalists. Word.  He had no knowledge about stocks trade or anything but he sure could talk nice
3205 2018-12-27 01:51:40 Tax cuts with no plan to address spending have me nervous. If Trump doesn’t acknowledge the national debt in the coming year we’re in trouble. TBH I don’t have confidence in the market and I sold all my stocks right around ‘03 as it seemed too unstable even then.
3206 2018-12-27 01:51:04 I'm very happy about the huge gain in stocks.  I attribute to great report from retailers on Christmas spending.  Even the dip because of the Fed increasing interest rate couldn't dampen.  Thanks POTUS!
3207 2018-12-27 01:50:50 the  entry barrier to investing in crypto is lower than investing in stocks and bonds. White papers vs financial jargon

3211 2018-12-27 01:49:05 WRONG! Stocks were not 1000pts

THEY WERE 1080pts!!! Highest single day gain IN HISTORY!
3212 2018-12-27 01:49:03 I would expect it’s due to Spinoffs or similar. 

I also would expect it to be the other way around, where there are less than 500 stocks in the S&P 500 due to acquisitions.
3213 2018-12-27 01:49:00 Somewhere, @MarthaStewart has got to be wondering why she had to do jail time but the current market manipulation that is quite clearly going on is “okay”?!?

3221 2018-12-27 01:46:19 I love markets commentators because they have no idea why stocks fell, and now have no idea why they’re rallying.
3222 2018-12-27 01:46:01 Furthermore, the definition of flat returns was 2008 to 2015. Simply not wise to gamble on stocks when you cant risk losing the money or do not have time. Dumb move.
3223 2018-12-27 01:45:49 I traded $cl for 10 years before fiddling with stocks.

Until btc arrived oil futures was the most volatile chart.

Focusing on one chart is a lot easier that trying to manage 5-10 charts/positions efficiently.

The next 10 years i will focus on btc & flip between tethers
3224 2018-12-27 01:45:49 ugh why buy airpods when you can buy stocks

3227 2018-12-27 01:44:45 #2020Election Investors will lose confidence in our nation's political leaders as we approach 2020. Loss of confidence in government is bullish for stocks and bearish for government bonds. This explains why the current stock market decline will not be a long-term bear market.
3228 2018-12-27 01:44:41 By "market run" do you mean a surge in stock prices? 

(I'm assuming that you spotty 16 year old virgins know what stocks are).
3229 2018-12-27 01:44:18 SOCIAL SOLIDARITY stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
3230 2018-12-27 01:44:09 Sorry, you are misinformed. If this person needed this money in the short term, they should have invested in more stable fixed return investments. To dump money into highly aggressive stocks without allowing the investment time to perform (years) is kind of like going to Vegas...
3231 2018-12-27 01:44:07 No president can control P\E ratios long term. Ignore the short up and downs... follow the long term trend. If you try to time things, you will lose. Set up your retirements for long term. 

If market volatility is affecting income now, you shouldn’t be in stocks at all.
3232 2018-12-27 01:44:04 I never worry about the stock market because I only buy stocks during crashes. Let the fools trade stocks and indices day in day out for pennies, I go for decades. Ceres hasn't been beating me up in the grains as much as usual, so I guess it will end up being a decent year.
3233 2018-12-27 01:43:31 i hear that’s bullish. Xi needs to go on state tv telling people to buy stocks

3239 2018-12-27 01:42:37 Also you (almost) always dies second when you trade stocks, this means that if you have have one stock left and do it you will win.
Also every time you hit jab try to follow up with jump and forward air.
3240 2018-12-27 01:42:28 Contrary to popular belief, stocks tend to perform well in rising rate cycles, until they reach 4% or higher
3241 2018-12-27 01:42:07 Cualquiera con primer semestre de economía o finanzas sabe que STOCKS no son inventarios.
3242 2018-12-27 01:42:01 FYI.  The stock market didn’t crash. U should stop watching cnnEvery year after Xmas the stocks drop in every large country. Check out China they dropped as well so sad that you just believe what cable feeds u.  Do some research. Also this year had record sales in retail
3243 2018-12-27 01:41:24 Thu, 27 Dec 2018: Tokyo stocks surged four percent at the open on Thursday, with investors heartened by Wall Street's best performance in nine years. The benchmark Nikkei 225 index soared 4.0 percent or 773,59 points to 20,100.65 in early trade.

3245 2018-12-27 01:39:48 @realDonaldTrump - Thank you for your comments today on buying stocks.
3246 2018-12-27 01:39:40 699 outside days on my scan (& that's filtered!). That's the most that I've ever seen. Last time we had 500+ outside days (last week), they almost all went outside + down (OK, except $GDX which stayed inside). IF 699+ stocks go outside + up, that will be another big day for index
3247 2018-12-27 01:39:31 @PnPCBC Is Trump using Presidency and Tweets to affect the stocks and benefitting by it?  Food for thought and looking into it!
3248 2018-12-27 01:39:12 So you were having a marginal Christmas as a result of the shutdown, dead refugee children, and Santa Claus so your propaganda machine sought a patriotic photo opportunity to boost your stocks...

Tell us, how are Iraqi president Bahram Sahlih and prime minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi?
3249 2018-12-27 01:38:54 And who said, yesterday, buy stocks today because they're gonna go straight up from here on out.....minus a few zigs of course!  'Twas me.  Thank you President Donald Trump you are doing GREAT despite the Fed and the Democrats. BUILD THAT WALL! Just think Dow up 1100 points!
3250 2018-12-27 01:38:26 Stocks are way up today dec 26, aren't you gonna say something, hater?
3251 2018-12-27 01:38:25 Yeah but Brawl also had MK and stages he could shark on really easily. Metaknight was really the only camp character besides like Snake and even then Snake ended stocks so early. MK had I-frames on a bunch of stuff and could just shuttle loop to both ledges under any stage
3252 2018-12-27 01:38:22 Mandalay Bay Resort SHOOTER worked for the US GOVT. and was a Professional Killer. Was set up by the FBI, Aided by the FBI to Secure the Doors and Entrances and Secured the Bump Stocks and Weapons and helped him gain entry into private elevator.  Paper Trail
3253 2018-12-27 01:37:53 The problem isn’t the 5% SPY rally. Its which stocks are rallying most which is concerning
3254 2018-12-27 01:37:38 Petro como Maduro saben a quien le hablan. No tiene ni idea que son los stocks pero convence a su secta de que sabe de economía ; ni siquiera siente vergüenza con los que saben leer y escribir cuando escribe semejante barbaridad
3255 2018-12-27 01:37:36 A group of optimists who have proved right in the past have stepped up their buying US stocks The number of corp executives and officers buying shares of their own companies has 2X'd in the past 2 months from the prior 2 insider buyers outpace sellers the most since Aug 2011
3256 2018-12-27 01:37:24 Well done. And thank you for the win on tariffs in China and the huge jump in the stocks today from that. Maybe you will take a break for New Years. Thank you for working so hard for us.  I know the troops enjoyed your visit.
3257 2018-12-27 01:36:54 "There's only upside." Huh?? This is not how falling stocks work and it's not how Donald Trump's relationships usually work either.
3258 2018-12-27 01:36:22 footstooling people who have their settings set to 3 stocks 3 minutes is what they deserve
3259 2018-12-27 01:35:48 Did you trade any stocks today? 
3260 2018-12-27 01:35:39 But, there’s one truth: gov’t shutdowns don’t do shit to stocks.
3261 2018-12-27 01:35:19 QOTD: Do you expect Stocks to go UP in the first quarter of 2019, DOWN or CONSOLIDATE sideways?
3262 2018-12-27 01:35:10 #SDSPH_UPDATES

Love Shot albums arriving at our house today. Only few available stocks left. We'll post the on hand items once we see the package already.
3263 2018-12-27 01:34:52 The stock market rally was due to stocks at an all time low, following a months long slide. Simple correction.
3264 2018-12-27 01:34:49 That's because they are thinking how to break the bad news the stocks are surging again.....
3265 2018-12-27 01:34:41 The #orangecheetoh leaves the country and stocks rally. Coincidence?
3266 2018-12-27 01:33:49 I’m surprised they traded stocks on Christmas Eve. I figured they’d take that day off as well. #Tucker
3267 2018-12-27 01:33:42 why do people paly with 99 stocks
3268 2018-12-27 01:33:31 This is the time to invest in stocks. The beauty of it is you can make so much money and not pay taxes.
3269 2018-12-27 01:33:30 Pension management funds rebalancing From stocks to bonds so now they have shares to lend and pocketing the fee they earn for doing so. They lend your shares to are, by and large, hedge fund managers. These hedge fund managers then use the borrowed stock to further short
3270 2018-12-27 01:33:29 Pot Stocks!
3271 2018-12-27 01:33:23 Your list of tradeable stocks is different. No unlimited liquidity. No instant fills. Restriciction to short SSR. Pretty much ruins all the reasons to be with tradenet
3272 2018-12-27 01:32:36 Parianas @_machiparu_ Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3273 2018-12-27 01:32:10 Up or down matter more than how much. Math is simple but stocks are simpler.
3274 2018-12-27 01:30:20 Sorry to hear, SL. You'll be back 100% after the break.

I'm sure you trade a bunch of different stuff, but all I remember is....

Die $BKNG Die

&

Run $MSFT Run

I bet you could make a career out of those 2 stocks & nothing else.
3275 2018-12-27 01:30:15 Trump leaves country. Stocks have their biggest one day gain in history. Coincidence? I think not.
3276 2018-12-27 01:29:37 THE STOCKS ARE CRASHING BECAUSE THEY ARE TERRIFIED OF LIBERALS COMING IN WITH A GIANT VINDICTIVE WRECKINGBALL TO TRUMPS AGENDA- 
        F  A  C T !!!!
3277 2018-12-27 01:29:31 You know investigations were taking up media time, stocks tanking, so you dropped crap bomb of pulling out of Syria and Afghanistan, was baited into Gov shutdown over vanity wall, lost a respected Sec of Def whose resignation you thought was good until someone explained it was a
3278 2018-12-27 01:29:28 #DJIA Most investors believe that political instability in Washington, DC is bearish for stocks. Not true. Political instability is bearish for government bonds. As we approach the 2020 election, stocks will enjoy a dramatic rally and bonds will suffer a nasty decline. #Stocks
3279 2018-12-27 01:29:17 You should aim to have your retirement funds in different asset groups. If you're in the category of wanting to be 100% invested in stocks at all stages of retirement then the highs and lows will be greater. If you have cash in the bank, use it to supplement income in a down year
3280 2018-12-27 01:29:05 Glad I bought stocks Monday
3281 2018-12-27 01:28:50 Because he knew about that 64 billion from bonds to stocks....
3282 2018-12-27 01:28:41 Very respectfully, I think you need to  find new sources of information and apply a better filter that information. Today’s 1000 move up was INPART due to a 64 billion dollar pension fund rebalance from bonds to stocks.
3283 2018-12-27 01:28:11 God is this what passes for Journalism these days?
You broadly agree on an extremely broad topic so you're basically the same. 
Well, I agreed with Trumps ban on bump stocks, I guess I'm morally equivalent to a man two steps away from being a white supremacist.
3284 2018-12-27 01:27:47 Just a gentle reminder that no man in his right mind would ever bump stocks with you
3285 2018-12-27 01:27:09 You who didnt vote for him will find reasons not to respect him,  my stocks are up, hes protecting our borders and bringing our troops home
3286 2018-12-27 01:27:01 When i woke up this AM, Trump was (1) the only president to not visit troops at xmas and (2) was responsible for a bad stock week.  By 10AM he had been to Iraq, stocks had best day EVER and the media quietly retracted the morning news.  What a day!
3287 2018-12-27 01:26:04 Question for the day:
How many stocks are there in S&P500 Index?
3288 2018-12-27 01:25:27 Need someone to teach me stocks man I suck 
3289 2018-12-27 01:24:59 Better check those whaling oil stocks... :p
3290 2018-12-27 01:24:22 trying to get a better understanding of stocks. if there are any books and/or websites you guys recommend i review, please pass the tea — i’m trying to sip some.
3291 2018-12-27 01:23:26 ...Petrogusano, los stocks aquí se refiere a acciones, no a inventarios. Su ignorancia es atrevida.
3292 2018-12-27 01:23:01 Latin American currencies weakened against a firm dollar on Wednesday, while stocks on Brazil's benchmark index hit a 6-week low as global equities retreated on worries of political uncertainty in U.S. & slowing global growth worldwide.
3293 2018-12-27 01:22:47 Don’t over analyze it just buy stocks with the eTrade app. And smile

3295 2018-12-27 01:22:28 Trump is in Iraq ..stocks rebound a thousand points dummy..
3296 2018-12-27 01:21:50 I've got you a causal link: children stop believing in Santa => expect less gifts bc parents buy them not magic elf => parents spend less money on gifts => hold more stocks bc more real income.
3297 2018-12-27 01:19:42 A bear market doesn't just mean stocks go down. It means they frequently have huge rallies amid the backdrop of decline, offering hope and optimism every few weeks that's snatched away just as fast.
-Morgan Housel
3298 2018-12-27 01:19:32 There are only 3486 stocks in the Wilshire 5000.
3299 2018-12-27 01:19:20 You have to add the only players here now are banks, buying and selling stocks between themselves. the rest of investors are leaving the ship. Similar pattern was done during the 2008 crisis, and a similar result will come, who can make a Massive, $64 Billion Buy Order??
3300 2018-12-27 01:19:02 trump leaves the country. Stocks go up over a thousand points. Coincidence?  
3301 2018-12-27 01:18:49 I did not act on today's action until the last hour.  Up/Dn Volume broke a pattern and didn't weaken--it got stronger.  A lot stronger! Started hour a little over 9:1 and finished the day at 23:1 Up/Dn.  Holy moly.  Bought 26 of the most oversold stocks in nibbles....
3302 2018-12-27 01:18:13 Lost my ass in pot stocks numerous times.  Don’t believe the bullshit. Proceed with extreme caution.......
3303 2018-12-27 01:17:46 And I agree that this is not about bump stocks, which I find to be useless, but how a single agency of the gov can re-write laws passed by Congress whenever they feel like. That is extremely dangerous to the foundations of our republic!
3304 2018-12-27 01:17:22 from what ive seen most matches dont even go past 5 mins. Melee uses 8 mins with 4 stocks so i think 3 stock and 7mins is good. Also with the increased damage in 1v1 it goes faster.
3305 2018-12-27 01:16:54 Bounce 1,086 points over sold market. Be going down stocks worst month secince 1931
3306 2018-12-27 01:16:27 It wouldn't have to recover if he would keep his mouth shut. The market rising today is partly because the 1%ers are buying up cheap stocks.....something the middle class can-t do  One day recovery is nothing to brag about when it dropped so much more than it recovered.
3307 2018-12-27 01:16:18 You mean 504 out of 505 stocks!
3308 2018-12-27 01:16:09 Pure speculation? No. These are existing companies. Overspeculated yes, but pure speculation is most ICO's, not stocks.
3309 2018-12-27 01:15:51 I bet the surgeon pronouncing dead those he was caring for still votes for idiots to have as many guns as wanted, bump stocks and all!
3310 2018-12-27 01:15:31 If someone keeps reviewing value of his house every day, we may suspect his mental health. But that’s what we keep doing with our stocks.
3311 2018-12-27 01:15:08 - Wealth Requires Patience
-Investments aren’t always Instant Payments.
- Stocks Can hit or Take some time to Build
- Apps Take time to build up.

3312 2018-12-27 01:14:41 No es más bruto porque no entrena. Stocks o inventarios? 
3313 2018-12-27 01:13:36 stocks rise by 1%.
3314 2018-12-27 01:13:22 All my stocks went up today  it’s a good day for me.
3315 2018-12-27 01:12:53 Trump wants 2use tax payers dollars for his wall as down payment to a Russian owned stell company,where he plans get paid w stocks& returns 2 his personal account. This wall demand Trump's biggest financial scam. This should be investigated. Follow the money
3316 2018-12-27 01:12:39 I'm not discussing bump stock and use for personal protection. I'm talking about the banning of bump stocks as a rate increasing device could then lead to future banning anything that increases the rate of fire for a semi-auto.
3317 2018-12-27 01:12:13 Stat of the day from @markets: Today was first time ever > 500 stocks in S&P 500 finished positive (there are 505 stocks in S&P 500). Previous record was 498 out of 500 stocks in 2011.
3318 2018-12-27 01:11:18 That’s great for people who play the stocks
3319 2018-12-27 01:11:12 It’s a winning news day for @realDonaldTrump ! Historic jump in stocks, visit to Middle East.

The #MSM bashes him daily, but he perseveres.

#MAGA
3320 2018-12-27 01:10:20 $64bn not enough for +1000 pts!
how about:
- feed MSM with "Mnuchin checking banks' liquidity". - sends worried markets further down.
- Trump: 'buy dip' + PPT
- Wells Fargo swaps bonds for stocks @ dip - $64bn +PPT pushes market a bit, investors jump on train
- Wells Fargo happy
3321 2018-12-27 01:10:14 Le grand ménage des stocks est fini? 
3322 2018-12-27 01:09:55 Or 4 stocks  (I’m a melee player originally tho so I’m biased)
3323 2018-12-27 01:09:31 Are there more than 500 stocks in the S&P 500?
3324 2018-12-27 01:09:31 Gee Whiz Kids... POTUS put the country into a tailspin by shutting down the government. The Dow plummeted and Trump wouldn’t visit our troops.  WRONG! He and his beautiful wife are in Iraq and stocks are +1000! MSM Doooshes!

3327 2018-12-27 01:07:22 we are all happy stocks are up, but point gains are an archaic way to measure the dow or any index. #percentnotpoints @CliffordAsness
3328 2018-12-27 01:07:15 Lot of people out there don’t get a simple thing: don’t invest in something you don’t know anything about. Many people have lost money in stocks, options, futures...and crypto, because they closed their eyes and invested without realizing the risk and without diversifying.
3329 2018-12-27 01:07:07 How the hell did stocks rebound so drastically, wow
3330 2018-12-27 01:06:57 We are up 433 for the week, AWESOME!  Is that an accomplishment or extreme volatility the market top? We only need another 4 days like today, 4,073 points, to get the Dow #Stocks Back To The Oct. High of 26,951.
3331 2018-12-27 01:06:20 Trickle up Economics! Let's start helping the bottom. Through better wages, benefits,job security. Instead these tax breaks, enormous profits. The CEOs instead, buy back their stocks. Give top employees huge bonuses. The worker's are forgotten. Time to stop this whole mechanism.
3332 2018-12-27 01:05:49 The government is shut down and the stocks are in turmoil, tariffs are hurting our farmers, and children are dying in US custody, but ok
3333 2018-12-27 01:05:02 Stocks go up, Stocks go down. Rich people manipulate stock prices.
3334 2018-12-27 01:04:02 We are up 433 for the week, AWESOME!  Is that an accomplishment or extreme volatility the market top? We only need to rally another 4,073 points to get the Dow #Stocks Back To The Oct. High of 26,951.
3335 2018-12-27 01:03:19 Stocks también son inventarios pero en contextos diferentes, no cuando se habla de valores.

En conclusión: Petro es un burro y los que creen que él va a salvar a Colombia son unos burros ilusos e ingenuos.
3336 2018-12-27 01:02:59 What a difference a day makes! 

Keep the prognostications coming. I'll run out and buy more stocks next time you complain about the market. 

Your magic 8 ball is broken.
3337 2018-12-27 01:02:53 And all the "experts" thought Mnuchin/Trump actions would drive stocks lower?
3338 2018-12-27 01:02:19 Damn millenals destroying our 401ks by not buying enough stocks only playing with them magical online coins instead 
3339 2018-12-27 01:01:52 Offer only available while stocks last, so hope for limited demand.
3340 2018-12-27 01:01:32 i been gettin dirty money jordan belfort stackin penny stocks while i’m flippin these birds
3341 2018-12-27 01:01:12 FWIW there are 500 companies in the index, but 505 stocks due to 5 companies (Alphabet, Discovery, News Corp, Fox & Under Armor) having more than one publicly traded share class.
3342 2018-12-27 01:00:26 Granted we can probably agree stocks had gotten “bigly” oversold - but that was nuts today. That was no mere bear market rally ! I believe pension rebalancing + PPT opportunistically stepping in , as needed. Then sprinkle in algos feasting on ruined shorts. Boom.
3343 2018-12-27 01:00:09 More money made on Wall St. destroying American cos by short selling (betting against their success) than is made investing in the future of America. Retail investors buy stocks because they believe in their future. Wall St. sells them short to panic retail to sell at loss.
3344 2018-12-27 00:59:51 Let’s send him on an indefinite world tour... stocks may bounce back to normal in a few weeks.
3345 2018-12-27 00:59:29 ... and we're suppose to think this #Dow upswing after numerous  major down swings is a good thing? Unstable. Only the amatuers were buying today, playing it like the lotto. No pros work the day after Christmas. #stocks #stockmarket

3358 2018-12-27 00:55:16 I'm back for less than an hour and you guys are already freaking out about whether there are more than 500 stocks in the S&P 500
3359 2018-12-27 00:54:22 10% of American investors own 84% of stocks. So why do I give a shit.
3360 2018-12-27 00:54:15 You can’t own the stocks when they are good and blame the other guy when they are bad. The policies of the #IdiotInChief are ruining our economy and your state run propaganda machine is selling his bullshit

3362 2018-12-27 00:54:01 Well he is a business man he does know a thing about stocks. Since he became president as a share holder I've benefitting from it.. 10 years ago not so much..
3363 2018-12-27 00:54:00 I've been going for DK's walkoff cargo down throw at 40%. Usually lasts 1-2 stocks before they change their mind.
3364 2018-12-27 00:53:43 So stocks came roaring back today with the highest single day percentage gain in almost a decade yet the fake news media remains silent. Funny how we only hear about market activity when it’s bad news for Trump.
3365 2018-12-27 00:53:40 What you’re saying makes no sense, Mexico pays for nothing. My husband has been losing money like crazy, every day he loses hundreds in stocks and his 401k. Wake up, trump is the ultimate conman he’s filled you and many others with lies and unnecessary hatred.
3366 2018-12-27 00:53:39 "Stocks rose higher despite virtually no news — which may have been a catalyst in its own right. 
President Donald Trump did not tweet until late in market hours Wednesday." - CNN.  Hmm, I think there may be a connection
3367 2018-12-27 00:53:34 AT these prices you would have to be bullish on Quality Australian Commodity Stocks. If you are just getting in you are well timed.
3368 2018-12-27 00:53:33 There are 500 companies. They include multiple shares classes for 5 companies. So companies like google have both stocks in the index. It’s not that weird.
3369 2018-12-27 00:53:15 just a reminder, Doug kass does not trade stocks, he just blows up twitter and a real money pro blog all day. Kass blew up his hedge fund long ago.

3371 2018-12-27 00:51:36 Poll: How many stocks should there be in the S&P 500?
3372 2018-12-27 00:51:31 There are never absolutes in life or business.  There are now 3.4 million mutual funds chasing 43,000 stocks

3374 2018-12-27 00:50:56 Crazy this man of say he's done something and all you have to do is research and find out that he's lied he's living in la-la land Trump has no love for all the people he's only for himself and how he wants the United States to become hell we're in a govermt shutdown. Stocks r dn
3375 2018-12-27 00:50:51 Another insane fact: there are more than 500 stocks in something named “the 500.”
3376 2018-12-27 00:50:23 Stocks to use ratio is similar. Yield is part of demand equation

Jack: Wow look at this kid spending all of his money on toy cars.... he should be investing in stocks or something
3378 2018-12-27 00:49:40 And kill.

Balancing certain characters by making it really hard to finish stocks is a terrible design choice imo.

3380 2018-12-27 00:49:05 Dow rallied over 1,000 points, a record rally.  Market was in a record oversold position (10 on 10 point scale).   Currently, I do not own any stocks.  The market is in a long-term downtrend, but still slightly oversold.  If it rallies to around 24,000, I will short the market
3381 2018-12-27 00:49:00 Haven't posted my shit thoughts for a long time.I still think its a dead cat bounce for $btc and we might go lower than 3k. But stock crash and bounce give me a thought that if something wrong with stocks and they are entered a bearish season $crypto might start a bull run soon.
3382 2018-12-27 00:48:37 Am I alone in thinking that the 1% just made MORE millions by buying back the stocks at artificially low prices, after causing them to drop through an organized sell-off over the past week ???


3383 2018-12-27 00:48:19 You missed point-my parents don’t have time to wait, are living off savings. In fact, my Dad’s still “playing” in stocks. This is bad 4 them
3384 2018-12-27 00:47:39 I look at it as an after Christmas sale on stocks.
3385 2018-12-27 00:46:52 I’m not buying that. What did they do w the 64 billion? Buy 1 trillion dollars worth of stock? The market went up because it was oversold. Plus these gangsters did the same thing they’ve been doing for 10 yrs. prop up stocks by fraud and mind manipulation.
3386 2018-12-27 00:46:40 Including having more than 500 stocks in the S&P 500…?
3387 2018-12-27 00:46:37 1.  So much for doubts on global economy and opec+ cuts. 
US petroleum stocks have fallen by 42 million barrels since mid-October as compared with a normal draw of 25 million.  Way too much bearish coverage. When opec+ cuts kick in, the bears will lose their teeth.
3388 2018-12-27 00:45:03 It’s a classic-even though I don’t pick individual stocks (except for fun, sometimes) I’ve found it a good read.
3389 2018-12-27 00:44:19 Slightly odd that there are more than 500 stocks in the S&P 500.
3390 2018-12-27 00:43:49 Wall Street was giving their insiders a nice Christmas present. Lower the value of stocks, buy it all up then raise it! It’s all a sham and Trump and Mnuchin are in on it ! Bet old Wilber Ross faired well. Excellent way to launder Russian money!
3391 2018-12-27 00:43:30 Enjoy while it lasts just dead cat bounce and many stocks are traded to synthetics which are being settled also and stocks are still over valued just like the dollar is
3392 2018-12-27 00:43:20 Today was an impressive day in the market...over 1500 stocks were up more than 5%...that is awesome! $IWM $NYA Fast averages on the @McClellanOsc crossed over to the upside, though are still negative, So the Summation Index was down again.  Volume was light though...its a start?
3393 2018-12-27 00:43:05 Am I the only one who thinks there shouldn’t be more than 500 stocks in the S&P 500?
3394 2018-12-27 00:42:32 When the stocks finally collapse and they will, it will be because of the democrat obstructionist in the house in the new year!
3395 2018-12-27 00:41:51 #Stocks,#Indexes Well . . . we don't know everything. That may be our goal, however, despite the infinite learning curve financial markets pose.
3396 2018-12-27 00:41:36 Didn't the administration just ban stocks?
3397 2018-12-27 00:41:22 The sell off of stocks on Christmas eve wasn’t the largest in history, but #FakeNews points at that, rather the historical rise the day after Christmas. #CmonMan #MAGA
3398 2018-12-27 00:40:08 Nah mate. FUT (FIFA Ultimate Team) involves a real LIVE market just like stocks where the value of players ect is affected by real time events, and you can make coins if you're quite savvy at it.
You'd prolly be quite decent at that side of hings like..

3400 2018-12-27 00:39:25 Liberals when stocks drop:
"Look at what Trump has done to the economy!"

Liberals today after the historic stock spike:
"Well Trump has nothing to do with stocks."

Face it. He's had a great 2 years.
3401 2018-12-27 00:38:55 #Stocks,#Indexes The NDX signal was particularly strong, and NDX was up 6.16% whereas SPX was up 4.96%. So, not correlation of signal topography with strength? OK, there is, as we have observed from time to time. But the correlation with rally duration appears stronger.
3402 2018-12-27 00:38:38 "stick to stocks" said the random guy to the man who literally brought cashtags to crypto 5 years ago
3403 2018-12-27 00:38:24 Gov goosed asset inflation (stocks, homes, property, etc) by issuing $11 Trillion in debt.  It's all "air" and we can't grow organically (without borrowing ) .  We are right back where we were in 2007 IMO...but instead of bank being broke...the Gov is.
3404 2018-12-27 00:38:08 Biggest gain in history.
A reason, there isn't a bunch of people screaming all sorts of things about stocks.
The stock market moves on whispers.
Fed NEVER raised interest rate under Obama, why? He needed all the help he could get.
Visited troops to distract? LOL
We need a wall.
3405 2018-12-27 00:38:05 we have been in IEF since Oct 5th thanks to @VolatilityVIX, there were indicators flashing red since then, and I would not chase this rally either. We live in a index fund world where valuations don’t mean anything & stocks move together
3406 2018-12-27 00:37:43 SESN was up 18.27 % today. (Remember, everything has been falling in the last 2 months, but wow this out performed all the blue chip stocks at 7% ish) - We are bullish on SESN only.
3407 2018-12-27 00:37:32 Expect a strong rally but with a lot of volatility in USA markets upto April /May 2019, kindly lighten ur positions on rallies , because the second half of 2019 can and may get really bad for individual PFs.
All energy stocks may be sold on rallies now IMO in case ur holding
3408 2018-12-27 00:37:11 Maybe it is just rude-ass schadenfreude on my part and I should just shut my trap.
But if you bought stocks today bc they're a bargain?
You really don't get it, do you?

3409 2018-12-27 00:37:05 Two days ago headlines read stock market has "worst day ever in a decade." Today it reads "biggest gain ever in a decade." The over sensationalized headlines is why people fear the market. Let traders worry about stocks short term profitability and you focus on long term growth.
3410 2018-12-27 00:36:23 As a general rule stocks priced above $5 with  a minimum average volume of 300,000 shares are tradable.
3411 2018-12-27 00:35:21 Yes, stocks go up and down, that's a thing.  It's the trends that matter and the trend isn't good thanks to a pointless trade war that's killing farms
3412 2018-12-27 00:35:05 Why don't you find out why stocks REALLY rallied.
3413 2018-12-27 00:34:55 Working overtime today on the best day ever for stocks after a week vacation on the worst week in decades is in no way a coincidence. You're the man Charles! Can't wait until @FoxBusiness sets you up with a couple more hours a day. Keep it up my man! #CPEffect

No problems at all... Go buy more stocks!

3426 2018-12-27 00:32:29 By the way, isn't it interesting that the NRA is silent on the new law to destroy, turn in and outlaw bumb stocks? 

Could it possibly be that Maria Butina who has turned federal evidence has them unable to open their mouths?
3427 2018-12-27 00:32:17 So now it is just a a game of banks. they will sell and buy themselves the stocks. This game is too rigged to be real
3428 2018-12-27 00:32:12 Idiota stocks no son inventarios
3429 2018-12-27 00:32:05 This is an inkling at 2 stocks vs a SOPO at 1 stock and 130%. What mind games? What about “having fun”? That inking was just wasting the time of the other people in that lobby at that point. Some people would rather play than watch a 4 minute chase fest but sure, “have fun”.
3430 2018-12-27 00:31:38 Wednesday was the most-positive day within the S&P 500 since at least 1990. Out of 505 stocks in the index, 504 of them closed higher than they did on Monday.

3435 2018-12-27 00:28:04 Don’t forget the stock market that had its highest gain in any one day ever bc all the billionaires bought the stocks that went down bc of the biggest one day loss ever on WednesdayWhat a bunch of idiots.
3436 2018-12-27 00:27:53 I missed the opportunity of bargain basement stocks!  
3437 2018-12-27 00:27:52 The stocks just set a record gain for one day.  Trump just left Iraq.  And WW3 that the dems want is on hold.  Syria and Russia are historical allies-it’s nothing new.  No more damn wars!!!   And if the wall was built the kids would not have died.  The end!
3438 2018-12-27 00:27:49 Someone made a lot of money on stocks today! Is this a dead cat bounce?

3441 2018-12-27 00:26:15 The stocks just set a record gain for one day.  Trump just left Iraq.  And WW3 that the dems want is on hold.  Syria and Russia are historical allies-it’s nothing new.  And if the wall was built the kids would not have died.
3442 2018-12-27 00:25:09 watch put options on FAANG stocks let's see what happens in next few days, todays rally might be over tomorrow or within the next 2 days

3444 2018-12-27 00:24:35 The only problem I see right now about my job is THAT I LIKE EVERYTHING REBECCA STOCKS US WITH AND I WANNA BUY EVERYTHING BUT I broke
3445 2018-12-27 00:22:17 Appearantly 2 of the biggest companies in my town are having major layoffs as of right now. They make bags and the other boxes for beer and pre cooked foods. Not small companies. I think this is odd timing - #StockMarket #stocks #cryptocurrency #Crypto #XRP #xrpcommunity
3446 2018-12-27 00:22:16 The S&P closed up 4.96%. Since 1950, there have only been 27 4.5%+ days. Of those 27 days, 7 of those days directly followed previous down days. When this occurs, the S&P moves up on average 0.22% the following day. #Stocks #StockMarket

3449 2018-12-27 00:21:01 We've seen corrections and bear markets before. But we have never seen a President who talks about the markets on Twitter, which instantly spreads and amplifies his influence. A tweeting POTUS is a new factor and unknowns will drive these mood swings.

3451 2018-12-27 00:20:49 & most didn't think the #Browns would take Mayfield #1 overall..stocks rise & fall between now & the draft..a lot can happen & there's also no guarantee the #NYG will take a QB with their 1st overall pick regardless of what the court of public opinion says or calls for
3452 2018-12-27 00:20:37 Guess what, they bounce really big today, a record for one day, over 1000 points. Good if you own stocks but it's not what drives the economy which is very strong. Funny how it's not trending huh? Some hate Trump so much that they want America to fail, sad.
3453 2018-12-27 00:19:54 so sad and you must be a dem...too bad stocks are back up over a 1,000
3454 2018-12-27 00:19:30 You are such a complete jackass. Trump visits troop in Iraq & the first time a First Lady went, stocks up 1086, 2 children were killed by their illegal abusive parents. Stop being stupid.
3455 2018-12-27 00:19:24 Our waters our fishermen our boats & living!
So what if it's 1%, it was sustainable.
The rest of Europe abused it, & our waters!
And depleted fish stocks!
Not us!
So fuc* the other 99%!
They don't deserve this natural resource!
3456 2018-12-27 00:18:12 usually that is the case but when stocks collapsed pensions suddenly looked underweighted so must have reduced some other allocations to maintaining equity weight . I think the smart $ will sell into this rally but greed always rules the day.
3457 2018-12-27 00:18:09 You don't know nothing, if you never had a girlfriend working for a solar company, and you bought stocks because of that. 
3458 2018-12-27 00:17:02 US Stocks rally : All five FAANG companies — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google parent company Alphabet — snapped their losing streak Wednesday. All five stocks finished the day up at least 6 percent as the Dow gained over 1,000 points, its highest point gain ever.
3459 2018-12-27 00:16:31 Literally, no. If they stop, or if they just have the sofas be the lower price permanently, everyone gets upset at them and their stocks go way down.
3460 2018-12-27 00:16:00 And something could be done about the social contagion victims and the kids with loon parents. (Personally I'd make an example of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt and put them in stocks for vegetables to be thrown at them.)
3461 2018-12-27 00:15:56 bears dumping gold stocks for copper
3462 2018-12-27 00:15:09 I’ve been investing since I was 18, retired at 52 a few years ago.  The individual investor is now a mere pawn to the institutions who are trading HUGE blocks of stocks and  markets.  Some advice:  Stay lona and strong!  Never spend more than you earn and always invest the rest!
3463 2018-12-27 00:14:46 And Man did that Stock Market Crash Today!!! It’s only +1086 points!!! Just a little FYI, you’re not buying stocks from Donald Trump!! And I hope you sold so you only list 20% while I held and made 20%. Looks like a 40% swing to me??? Rationalize that Junkie!!
3464 2018-12-27 00:12:53 Right.... Great to hear your timing is flawless, but mine isn't. Pick good stocks and don't ditch them when the Street goes all paranoid.

For no good reason I should add.

3466 2018-12-27 00:12:11 Stocks remain down sharply for December, with all three major indexes down more than 10% for the month to date and the Nasdaq in bear-market territory.
3467 2018-12-27 00:12:10 No sé, pero creo que “stocks” e “inventarios”, en ese contexto, son cosas completamente diferentes. Es como si el que dse hubiera graduado de economía hubiera sido Quico.
3468 2018-12-27 00:11:57 Look at the stocks today....ass!
3469 2018-12-27 00:11:39 Me pregunto si en Sony se han coscado con el "si hubiéramos hecho la PsX Mini en condiciones, estaríamos vendiéndolas a 100€ y agotando stocks en Navidades"

A veces un tropiezo viene bien.

Si hoy por hoy Sony hiciera la mini de nuevo, sería brillante.
3470 2018-12-27 00:09:46 Who even plays 2 stock in a 1v1 match? You lose stocks so fast!
3471 2018-12-27 00:09:26 Can you even imagine that people honestly were cheering for the drop in stocks, they were cheering that middle class hardworking people were loosing their 401 k retirement. Really people stop hating the president and start living our country.
3472 2018-12-27 00:09:22 How is it that stocks with nothing solid behind them get pumped and PPS rockets on "assumptions" and "speculation" when stocks such as $RCGP have a extremely low float 284K and just completed a huge #CBD #HEMP merger and people shrug it off like nothing happened? cracks me up...
3473 2018-12-27 00:09:15 And my stocks have turned to crap. Thanks Fat Boy.
3474 2018-12-27 00:09:11 And, as you noted in the piece, there was no end of fundamental factors to trade off. Stocks always get rocky when rates go up — and especially when they are overvalued.
3475 2018-12-27 00:09:02 Yo estoy d acuerdo q uno no tiene x q saberlo todo ni con la excusa d aspirar a la presidencia. Pero es inaceptable y asusta q una persona q aspira a dirigir un país crea saberlo todo. Si el trino es d economía, haga la tarea d pensar en contexto e identificar, stock y stocks.
3476 2018-12-27 00:09:01 So out of topic concept does anyone think stages like hanenbow, 3D land, mushroomy and all the other platform stages be banned automatically online when you hit 1v1? Cause it’s really annoying to face elo cheesers who pick zoners or floaties set 2 mins 2 stocks with 3D land.
3477 2018-12-27 00:07:54 Got word from a successful banker at @EastWestBank that now would be a great time to buy stocks. He said, "it's a great time to buy, then in a month buy more, than another month buy more, untill the market hits the bottom."

3479 2018-12-27 00:07:36 Believe me if you own stocks you lost more in the past month than you gained today. You owe no thanks to Trump for today.
3480 2018-12-27 00:07:28 Tell your dad that as long as stocks rip, the Fed is still in play.  Puts a ceiling on stocks.

3485 2018-12-27 00:06:27 I don’t believe in the ability to time the market, but taking advantage of the drop in prices, I was able to pick up some great businesses selling at a discount before the stock market rally yesterday.
