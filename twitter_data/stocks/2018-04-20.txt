51 2018-04-22 23:16:42 No bump stocks. If you want to play Rambo, go to a licensed gun range and shoot an AR all you want. Just can't own one. No reason to.

67 2018-04-22 22:46:43 On what basis do you make definitive statements about the purpose of guns? Are you an expert in self-defense, for example?

The truth about bumpfire stocks is that they're gimmicks. Lots of people own them and do no wrong with them.
68 2018-04-22 22:43:58 Eh, maybe. I usually gotta special order my shoes as it is, there's only one place locally that stocks anything close to my size. Then again I'm also pretty rough on my shoes so they'd lose their newness pretty quick
69 2018-04-22 22:43:53 Background checks, waiting periods, bans on bump stocks, assault rifles, etc., restricting gun ownership from individuals with mental illnesses, criminal backgrounds, abuse charges, stalking, etc. You can still have gun reform without interfering with the 2nd amendment.
70 2018-04-22 22:43:51 The story at the end is that bump stocks are purchased for the purpose of making a semi-automatic weapon into a very close facsimile of an automatic weapon. There are absolutely no uses for an automatic weapon except killing — people, animals, or your neighbor’s garage
71 2018-04-22 22:42:46 @talkRADIO The NRA has a stranglehold on Congress. 
And yes, you can still buy bump stocks.
72 2018-04-22 22:37:47 Peddling the same old lies and false claims. Science has proven fish farms do not hurt wild salmon. If people really  wanted to protect wild stocks they would stop fishing them and support farming salmon.
73 2018-04-22 22:35:50 I’m glad @BarackObama is acting like he is for gun control. He was in fact the fool who approved sales of bump stocks used in the Vegas massacre. Lord O has blood on his hands also.

77 2018-04-22 22:30:13 No. Bump stocks are ridiculous, but shouldn't be illegal.
78 2018-04-22 22:29:55 don’t buy me flowers buy me stocks
79 2018-04-22 22:28:36 Absolutely right. Getting ready for earnings week. I bet your hourly rate you make trading stocks is a lot more than it would cost to hire yard work. Now you have to hire a masseuse to work those sore muscles. 
80 2018-04-22 22:27:08 That’s a valid point that guy makes, but the high-capacity magazines are used more for sport than anything, with defense moderately close behind. Bump stocks are considerably slower than full-auto. “Combat style” is just a modern rifle. Many older rifles are just as deadly.
81 2018-04-22 22:26:17 I love Waiting to exhale she got 1.5 mill, 2 houses, 500k in stocks and bonds and the Mercedes station wagon (which is a waste of a mercedes). That's how you divorce a cheating husband. No matter how many times I've watched this movie I still cheer at that part.

97 2018-04-22 22:08:49 I'm fine with bump stocks being gone too. Honestly, I had never heard of them until the Vegas shooting. RE: background checks, they are pretty pervasive in most places already. The problem with them is that they cannot ID crazy before the fact. Nothing can.
98 2018-04-22 22:06:32 Hey @elonmusk, I just wanted to say that I LOVE my new Model S 75D, but I am also concerned with the 36 hour App Outage we just had.

100 2018-04-22 22:06:06 I'm not saying take all guns away from everyone, I want to see no more sales without thorough checks like gun shows, no sales to people with criminal records, mental illness or domestic violence , Ban assault style automatic weapons and bump stocks mandatory safety training

108 2018-04-22 21:55:28 Bump stocks, in my opinion, are an excellent example of a firearm attachment whose advantages simply cannot justify its consequential implications. I don’t personally see any reason whatsoever for ever needing a bump stock.
109 2018-04-22 21:55:16 what does that have to do with bump stocks???
110 2018-04-22 21:53:25 I would ban bump stocks and limit the size of the magazine. Comprehensive background checks everywhere guns are sold (even at gun shows). A mandatory waiting period for all firearm sales (even at gun shows). Also to allow family or LE to confiscate guns if the owner is a threat.
111 2018-04-22 21:52:47 These countries also have strict rules abd checks for getting them which is what we are asking for. Also those countries don't allow AR 15's..high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
112 2018-04-22 21:50:47 You couldn't be farther from the truth. You even say that by referring to gat cranks and bump stocks. It's not the same.

118 2018-04-22 21:47:18 I think some of your work is a little repetitive in terms of overuse of the same stocks/copy and paste. But overall, you have insane talent that you just need to figure out how to use it right. Big things coming for you, no doubt. Keep it up

130 2018-04-22 21:40:26 The editors of @GQMagazine just came out and stated that there 21 books that you don’t need to read and one of them was the #Bible! So peeps, if U have stocks in GQ dump them now, because I can see another #Titanic situation!

132 2018-04-22 21:39:54 Sell your Oil, Coal and Gas stocks. Invest in Alternative Energy. If you own a house by solar panels. It gets cheaper and cheaper every day. You should be able to repay the purchase in a few years. If you're poor take public transit as much as you can if you live in a city.

142 2018-04-22 21:29:15 Picking stocks (or horses) really does develop good mental habits
143 2018-04-22 21:27:36 ...so it's not a "mistake" to look to buy stocks that have come down the most during a market correction - as long as one know what set-ups to use. Too much "in the box" thinking out there that is unoriginal and based on old bromides and "rules."
144 2018-04-22 21:25:58 False. “The Larry” is definitely waiting for your teammate who has multiple stocks to die where you take his stock at the last sec
145 2018-04-22 21:25:00 EuroStoxx Futures have rallied for 4 weeks in a row, adding 7.4%, making this the biggest 4 week gain for 68 weeks. The sequence of weekly rallies has extended to 5 weeks only once in the 161 weeks since 20 March 2015, the exception coming on 6 January 2017, 68 weeks ago #stocks
146 2018-04-22 21:22:32 Hi folks,  just need  to say a huge thank you to everyone who came today, and made it all feel  like a great comunity day. Mucho efaristo to all the Knights, Ledbury morris guys, burger guys, bouncy castle and Mr whippy. Hope all annoyed there day. I did till the stocks x
147 2018-04-22 21:21:49 But if you're someone who's dependent on the manufacturing of synthetic drugs, chances are that's not going to be sorted by the time stocks run out. And arguably, as you say, what remains of a govt will have to be focused on ensuring the basics of survival for the bulk of people.

149 2018-04-22 21:19:11 Thank you. Good and bad in everything. Just a shame that some people are so rude and offensive. Deeply affronted by some of the things said to me today. Good night to all.
150 2018-04-22 21:18:48 Have to buy shares and stocks in chastity companies
151 2018-04-22 21:18:30 That's not necessarily true if one is using U&R and other Ugly Duckling set-ups. In this market often the best moves come from the stocks that have been beaten up the most...e.g. $AMAT and $LITE in early February...

154 2018-04-22 21:14:37 As my retired floor trader neighbor says, the fastest way to get rich is to buy out of the money calls on the best growth stocks on a dip.
155 2018-04-22 21:14:27 Easy access to them IS....especially access to AR 15's, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. Both sides agree Nicolas Cruz never should have had access to a gun..but only ONE side is willing to do anything about it and it's not your side.

157 2018-04-22 21:14:13 People are like stocks, acquire assets, avoid/drop liabilities and ignore market rumours; acquire insider information wherever possible.
158 2018-04-22 21:12:43 I’m not questioning some of that, but the principle “just because you can do something, doesn’t men you should” applies.  Some of us have seen the carnage that ensues when some declare UDI.  Thankfully, the new generation of journos are more in tune with a modern mindset.

160 2018-04-22 21:11:24 I was wondering about buying some stocks today. Suddenly I remembered we were Sunday, and markets are closed until monday, and by the way I will need to do a bank transfer to the broker first... I'm not buying non-crypto securities anymore... Too much time wasted.
161 2018-04-22 21:10:00 The Dow finished Friday 94 points below Thursday's low. It was the 2nd day in a row that The Dow had closed beneath the previous day's low. The run last extended to 3 days on 30 December 2016, 328 trading days ago #stocks

166 2018-04-22 21:04:46 I said similar other day n I was ignored, Tory teflon party nothing sticks , but all the shit stocks on labour, now could that be because the shit is planted. And media silenced like the charities
167 2018-04-22 21:04:27 Any kind of warfare now is just to line the pockets of defense companies and contractors. The mere fact stocks rise when these weapons are used should tell you everything that's wrong about it. Death is profitable.

170 2018-04-22 21:02:05 I'm with Paul and Annie on this - we cannot create/force a distinction between advice/guidance unilaterally, or even multilaterally, there's no way it could be enforced. It doesn't matter what the FCA say (for example) the public aren't regulated by them, but we are.

178 2018-04-22 20:52:05 I need to enroll in Beyonce's dad class in the fall. We are in synch in a lot of ways. He doesn't like investing in stocks ( I don't either but I do I just don't watch it) and he is with the wealthy mindset of believing your primary home is NOT an investment.

182 2018-04-22 20:48:17 Oh and restrict bump stocks to the same level as suppressor to deter would-be wrongdoers from getting their hands on a device that can be badly exploited. The NRA actually said they would be fine with a bump stock ban too.

206 2018-04-22 20:24:31 I don’t think it’s about good or bad.  I think it’s about ensuring that all respect the existing framework.  As mentioned, the steelworkers (for instance) understood the distinction between guidance and advice.  I suspect it’s more a bête noire than anything else for some of ‘em.
207 2018-04-22 20:18:06 I recommend to invest in this project $VOISE Since this is the first virtual trading platform for stocks and cryptocurrencies based on their own AI engine. Don't miss a moment!

209 2018-04-22 20:17:17 There are 'good' financial journalists like Paul and Annie, just like there are 'good' advisers. I don't agree with them (or you) all of the time, but life/money is complex isn't it. A good financial journalist has greater reach than we do, and generally does more good than not.

Secondly, he added that he didn’t think that depositors should panic, and that there was no evidence of a ‘bank run’ anytime soon.  Convenient caveat aside, he got his scooop, and folk, as expected, ignored his PS and we saw a run on the bank.  
213 2018-04-22 20:11:24 OddStockTrader I can't imagine what it's like to start with stocks.
214 2018-04-22 20:09:47 I remember Robert Peston defending his coverage of the breaking Northern Rock story.  In the reports he said two things; firstly, that it was hugely damaging for Northern Rock’s reputation that it was running out of liquid resources and needed access to emergency funds.
215 2018-04-22 20:09:42 Hi all

Late to this, but I personally think this debate is a distraction

Especially as the only ones interested are the good guys of all stripes

The bad guys just get on with using whatever words they need to use to do what they do

Have a great night all
216 2018-04-22 20:08:50 Good question. My perspective is this. Universal background checks. A five day wait period. Block people with mental health issues and domestic violence. No bump stocks. Reduce the size of magazines available to 30. Thoughts?

220 2018-04-22 20:05:39 VaLoR played vs Tweek’s Bayo so well, but that broken risk-reward ratio from Bayo was really showing and VaLoR had a hard time finding openings and securing stocks because of that. Tweek just got so much more off of winning neutral too.

Screw this MU.
221 2018-04-22 20:05:13 let's skip ahead a couple of days, NRA this, gun owners that, gun control, gun reform, ban bump stocks, raise age limits, ban "assault rifles", talking point, talking point, talking point...and now back to Russia, Mueller, and Stormy Daniels
222 2018-04-22 20:04:58 It’s also an issue the regulator is very interested in. And the government for that matter.
223 2018-04-22 20:02:39 The only thing you should buy on sale is stocks.

226 2018-04-22 19:57:56 We can't leave language alone, like you can't leave financial advice alone - I guess you're a wordsmith first and a financial 'adviser' second (well, you do give advice), for us it's the other way round - except we're the only 'regulated' people (press regulation seems weaker)
227 2018-04-22 19:56:30 All those types of investments, and certainly this applies for hedge funds at least, are a worse investment than just buying stocks so perhaps it's a good thing.

254 2018-04-22 19:33:11 Within limits. And scandalously paid for by all you good guys. My advice though is not to refuse to pay your FSCS levies.
255 2018-04-22 19:32:46 "Step in? .. my govt?" The killing began with the USA, which is simultaneously killing & sponsoring the death squads. Fact, not fake. Continuation of the killing is good for business. Wall St stocks go up or down with the kill rate. Wallstreet's got friends in high places.
256 2018-04-22 19:30:25 Soooo. What I should do is look at all republican senators, who have large stocks and invest in them because 4 sure they are going to make money as long as Donny Grifter is the Thief in charge.
257 2018-04-22 19:30:19 Well I believe the vegas shooter had 15 guns with bump sticks.  Bump stocks are designed to help the gun shoot faster.  It seems logical that shooting bullets faster would kill or injure more people.
258 2018-04-22 19:29:30 the same crazy money run BTC and Oil stocks
259 2018-04-22 19:29:24 Consequently protections are in place for those dealing with regulated advisers. This is actually he crux of the matter.
260 2018-04-22 19:28:49 Yeah that’s the reason. Not the PG play at all. Parker, Jordan and Lebron wouldn’t matter with. Bledsoe as your PG
261 2018-04-22 19:28:14 Bad refs can very much attribute to blowing a 20 point lead.
262 2018-04-22 19:27:15 Some of them were regulated independent advisers!
263 2018-04-22 19:27:14 housing prices up, food stamps down welfare fraud down tariffs are more fair taxes down ISIS almost gone retirment stocks are up unemployment at a 47 yr low I can't help but think Trump is doing a great job I voted for Cruz until it come down to Trump/Clinton no way in hell
264 2018-04-22 19:26:33 It's frustrating that millions of pounds has been invested by BSPS members on the say so of non regulated 'advisers' and yet trying to ensure clarity on what advice is is seen as somehow being self preserving.

It's about ensuring the public understand what they are acting on.
265 2018-04-22 19:26:30 Another AR-15 shooting...but we are banning bump stocks and giving out AR-15s like it's Christmas. #thanksNRA
266 2018-04-22 19:25:56 Ready for homeland @adam_stocks_ 
267 2018-04-22 19:25:23 Its just a list of technically and/or fundamentally weak stocks. Tier'1 is 'arguably' the worse, but I'd not get overly focused on that. As ever... its very subjective, but many have been suggested by others. I try to only highlight the big/mid cap', for liquidity reasons.
268 2018-04-22 19:24:24 You are doing a great job sir. Almost bought their stocks until I saw your report.
269 2018-04-22 19:23:37 Subtrack paycheck from the millions of taxpayer funds paid to trumps private golf properties & added in profits from his hotel up the street & the insider trading off his tweets that affect stocks & trumps making as much profit off his position as he can b4 kicked out
270 2018-04-22 19:19:59 Touche.
Trying again. 
One of the tough things about shorting stocks is that it's a concave, path-dependent process in which even the most skillful, best-resourced and experienced practitioners tend to blow themselves up.
271 2018-04-22 19:19:54 what can I say 
272 2018-04-22 19:19:38 I still respect Chandler's sense of humour most. Paraphrasing Monica talking about stocks and bonds:
Monica: "When they start going down, that's when I get out".
Chandler: "That's so not me".
It still makes me laugh today, but I'm juvenile. Genius comedy and happy memories.

275 2018-04-22 19:17:14 Just noticed that this great back and forth battle between the Celtics and Bucks features two jersey sponsors whose stocks have been under pressure (GE & Harley Davidson, respectively).
276 2018-04-22 19:16:29 it applies to nearly everything i kno bro.. everything. Sports, business, stocks, bodybuilding, art, music, politics, military science etc. The common thread is always "focus & mastery before expansion"
277 2018-04-22 19:14:33 Literally sitting on cash, or do you mean metaphorically (ie have a lot of cash not invested in stocks)?
278 2018-04-22 19:13:48 California has a 30 day waiting period, and a 10 round magazine limit. How’d that stop the YouTube shooter? You do realize they’re banning bump stocks, a shooter can easily do a mag swap, etc.

284 2018-04-22 19:05:46 They have stated they want bans and confiscation of semi automatic weapons. You can’t buy assault weapons. Bump stocks are not an efficient way of shooting.
285 2018-04-22 19:05:42 In case U hadn't heard Bump stocks are now banned federally via the ATF.
286 2018-04-22 19:05:17 Very expensive and fashion is fickle, for that reason it’s a risk buying imo. I guess this what momentum stocks are all about
287 2018-04-22 19:03:11 Ban bump stocks. Nationwide registry. No gun sales without mental health background check. No more gun shows. No large capacity magazines. Required training and certification.  Making gun owners responsible for what happens with their gun. There are many, many more.
288 2018-04-22 19:03:06 bought weed company stocks...just going to sit on it for a while and see what happens 
289 2018-04-22 19:03:03 Well that’s because the worst player on the floor is dominating the ball.  Bledsoe is a terrible fit for this team. Questions as to how Horst has this job

294 2018-04-22 18:54:53 Come on @CBS taking “assault rifles”, bump stocks, and mental heath policies and the reason they should be outlawed on @swatcbs. Also, saying an AR-15 is a ghost gun and a machine gun cuz of a bump stock is not accurate at all! I know the show is on Thur nights but I am catching
295 2018-04-22 18:54:06 The company that manufactures bump stocks is ceasing production. If you’re a candidate running for office who still supports the selling them, just realize that even the people who make bump stocks think they aren’t necessary or worth fighting for.

297 2018-04-22 18:53:42 The irony is, if he was a really good businessman, like he claims to be, he'd could have just pumped his "small" inheritance of $600m in stocks and shares and be worth more than he is now.

309 2018-04-22 18:39:59 We know that the oceans have taken up a lot of the excess carbons that we put into the atmosphere, but these carbons are turning the oceans warmer and more acidic, which is not good for marine life, from smallest to largest.  We are losing fish stocks & more.
310 2018-04-22 18:39:55 agree with you anthony: pipeline expansion down the hill, stock buybacks and increasing dividends to me are the reasons for not owning big pharma stocks unless u have tons of money to go for dividends.

324 2018-04-22 18:29:56 Dear Reader,

It’s no secret that when marijuana is in the news, pot stocks soar.

When Colorado opened its doors for recreational marijuana sales in 2014, a $1,000 investment in United Cannabis Corporation (CNAB) turned into more than $100,000 in just four months.
 
And had you

327 2018-04-22 18:24:55 Why would anyone own big Pharma stocks bro? No pipeline, revenue drying up, eps falling every Q, and Mgmt driving share price into the ground.

360 2018-04-22 17:52:32 Lol. Well it depends. If your product is not easily accessible then yeah. Eg. you sell stuff but no store stocks them, and your only option is to deliver it, free delivery ups the chances of a positive response because you ain’t the only one in the market
361 2018-04-22 17:50:43 Thanks. Difficult to implement for international stocks. My fix to P/B is using Price/8-years of accumulated retained earnings. Also easier to compute than just Price/Retained Esrnings. I hope to see new research for these metrics someday.
362 2018-04-22 17:49:22 Time to cash in your oil stocks and put your investments into Green stocks!
363 2018-04-22 17:49:20 He was using bump stocks. Fully automatic rifles are banned. Either way, bump stocks make guns fully automatic so there’s no reason they should be legal. Any magazine over 30 rounds is probably unnecessary too. But banning AR-15’s is way too far.

371 2018-04-22 17:40:07 Yep. But dont agree with >hope for a reversal & >dont buy a down trend. In fact, mean reversal #Trading (in Stocks - EOD) is high profitable.
372 2018-04-22 17:40:01 Absolutly, i also feel the capital of crypto will continue to grow within itself in terms of market cap, and can continue to grow larger each year, even without new people entering crypto. And even with more people joining crypto, each year will surely be better than the last.

382 2018-04-22 17:32:50 Not purchasing value, but the value the money would typically have if invested in a 7% returning account (reasonable for stocks).
383 2018-04-22 17:31:43 I have to say that @khanacademy's section on stocks is absolutely amazing. I wish I knew about that source when I started. So easy to understand from the videos. :) It's good to refresh your knowledge!
384 2018-04-22 17:31:12 $Cann $isol $thcx i am very confident about. Only in DMGI.V LOTO and DM.V right now as crypto stocks for flips, but have a nice crypto portofolio including NEO, ADA, VEE and otherd... and holding FAT all the way till they get bought out lol. (In since .17c)
385 2018-04-22 17:29:38 Marijuana stocks are heating up in the stock market 
386 2018-04-22 17:29:21 Vlad stocks interview >>>>>

388 2018-04-22 17:27:32 What settings do you use to find stocks bouncing off lower kelt in a stocker screener.  Thanks
389 2018-04-22 17:27:08 It's looking crypto in the green just need 300 to be breaking even hoping it will continuously  grow. If not got some etf and stocks. 
390 2018-04-22 17:24:27 Blockchain technology is what I’m all about. As for crypto - What interests me the most is my generation’s willingness to invest in crypto sooner than they’d make traditional investments in bonds, stocks, etc. Not 100% what the stats are so don’t quote me on this
391 2018-04-22 17:23:53 Nipsey hussle got yall buying penny stocks lmaoo
392 2018-04-22 17:23:38 #FED #Stocks #bonds Nice chart!  Does bonds include Municipal Bonds?  They have had big selloffs  on most volatile days since Feb. 2018.
393 2018-04-22 17:22:06 last week Auto stocks did great, and IT stocks were in limelight due to falling rupee. What next in IT stocks, checking Infy, TCS, Hexaware, Wipro Cient, KPIT, TechM and 8K Miles.
394 2018-04-22 17:18:41 Delusional??? These are good questions. Ultimately it is subjective. We have already agreed that automatic weapons and bazookas are military-grade. So bump stocks should be outlawed, but aren’t. Assault riffles are more of a gray area. They are designed to make a big hole...
395 2018-04-22 17:18:34 @rfgent1 So let me get this straight. This fool @BarackObama is tearing into the @NRA yet HE APPROVED SALES OF BUMP STOCKS- used to massacre 58 people in Vegas. It’s amazing how this arrogant jackass still shows ZERO accountability for his failures.
396 2018-04-22 17:18:33 Catholic like Top Brand of Stocks in. The definition of Christian Church in this new Synergy of Being and Bot will augment.
397 2018-04-22 17:16:17 I always read your strong views on long term “hold” on quality value stocks but when to sell? Can u tweet about that, especially from a DGI value point of view.
398 2018-04-22 17:12:58 Let’s talk stocks (())
399 2018-04-22 17:12:47 Market cap of FAANG Stocks =$ 3 Trillion (20th April close)
India's Economy :Everything u can count $ 2.5 Trillion!!
What Economy ?

400 2018-04-22 17:12:34 Why is it worse for women? I'm a woman. I'm making more money and paying less tax on it.The value of my home is higher. My stocks are worth more. I don't feel as if my son will be drafted to fight in a war. What's worse?
401 2018-04-22 17:12:31 We recommend watching this short film by @pewtrusts about #IUU. Scary stats: 90% of global fish stocks are overexploited or fished to the limit, $23.5B USD worth of seafood stolen per year totals about 20% of fish sold. Case for #blockchain #sdg14 #sdg10 #FishcoinNetwork
402 2018-04-22 17:11:33 Trade? Like stocks?  When I start out at -$150 on payday stocks are the last thing on my mind!
403 2018-04-22 17:09:32 You wanted 1 named, I named 1, but also said 1000's more. The company had to relable all it's current stocks costing £1000's but that is a mirocosm of the rediculous laws that are forced upon us. Talk to Tim Martin about EU laws or Mr Dyson

406 2018-04-22 17:08:38 And just so you know, it isn’t easy. You’ve probably never shot a gun but I assure you what that guy did was not easy. The only reason he was able to kill so many was because of bump stocks which basically make the gun full auto. The nra trump and I are for banning those.
407 2018-04-22 17:07:08 Offer valid while stocks last they'll see
I don't know how long
408 2018-04-22 17:06:49 @realDonaldTrump I'm sending my jews to attack your stocks
409 2018-04-22 17:06:39 Most of these stocks are now well discovered. They won’t add to risk adjusted returns.
410 2018-04-22 17:06:27 Hello Ronnie - of course it's wrong. It's a horrid thing to do. But it's not made any better by public humiliation either. We shouldn't make social media some kind of modern day stocks that lets us throw rotten fruit at someone as punishment.
411 2018-04-22 17:05:28 Ladies and Gentlemen! All outerwear is reduced by 30% online and in-store, so come and grab yourself a reet good deal while stocks last! #shoplocal #supportlocal #weeklyfreestyleplease

413 2018-04-22 17:03:21 I was ALL IN mining stocks when in the mining business, and ALL IN gold and silver when in the bullion business.  Today, I'm ALL IN #Bitcoin!

417 2018-04-22 16:58:37 Sir can you please give your thoughts on the graphite stocks for the next 3-4 months ie HEG, graphite India...also what about excel cropcare and ifb industries @WizardofDS these two scripts are leaders in their industry but your fund decided to cash out way fast..why?

419 2018-04-22 16:57:41 plus, full auto can be easily hacked with gat cranks or bump stocks. so it’s basically the same weapon. same capabilities.
420 2018-04-22 16:52:06 Yes because Islam didn't get hijacked by the white monarchy and appropriated. Hence Jesus looking like he's from Manchester.    And that's why Islam stocks to its teachings no matter how antiquated.
421 2018-04-22 16:51:57 get stocks out a pack from someone else and gets dropped lol tell the treu things
422 2018-04-22 16:49:41 Jan dhan
423 2018-04-22 16:49:30 Thanks! I’ve done the same with others. People don’t hear about/forget things like ISIS gone, NK, stocks records, GDP, unemployment record lows, tax cuts, MS13 deportation, pedophile arrests, most women in high WH positions, and on and on. Never reported - especially CNN/MSNBC
424 2018-04-22 16:48:44 1/ You’ll never see the “tax law” do this. The Right would rather see co. stocks bought back and snivel about welfare.
425 2018-04-22 16:46:32 Why hasn't he been forced to resign Like Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald was? She couldn't vote on bills or write bills to benefit her stocks... THIS IS CORRUPTION AT IT'S FINEST... #NeoTrumpism
426 2018-04-22 16:46:15 I've read the first 3 editions of O'Neils how to make money in stocks. Did he add enough to edition 4 to make it worth reading? Thanks
427 2018-04-22 16:45:31 Or bump stocks and other accessories which in many states is legal and they don't need special permission.
428 2018-04-22 16:43:46 I took 7 stocks in a crew battle
429 2018-04-22 16:43:40 I agree. They should ban bump stocks. The guy also broke laws before ever even shooting the people. Laws don’t stop bad people from breaking them it just stops law abiding citizens.
430 2018-04-22 16:43:22 Ban assault/military style weapons/bump stocks from civilian society.
431 2018-04-22 16:42:32 @sneaker_stocks
432 2018-04-22 16:41:43 there were 162 b/c guns were available to ppl that shouldnt have them and "assault" rifles are readily available. machine guns are already illegal, now they are taking away bump stocks, why do ppl need assault rifles? handguns work just fine for home defense.
433 2018-04-22 16:40:57 Patting yourself on the back? Happy a few people like you while the majority don't? Where's your post about the shooting that happened today? Where's that ban on bump stocks you promised? You really are something else. #DumpTrump
434 2018-04-22 16:40:20 Important: when you get in a trade, you must have a trading strategy. You have to know what your target is. And ALWAYS use a stop/loss, in case you end up in the wrong side of the market. Follow the money! #bitcoin #altcoins #stocks #forex
435 2018-04-22 16:38:34 You coming lad? Getting tickets 1st may, will look at trains etc if we get tickets

438 2018-04-22 16:36:11 Lowest black unemployment since LBJ, stocks highest in history, highest employment participants in history,
439 2018-04-22 16:35:01 When I first started trading stocks I treated it much like I approached my career in business. In that world, I had to try and control things, used my “will” to make things happen, and my personality to win people over (or at least try to).
440 2018-04-22 16:34:30 Last night we got pulled over right In front of stocks shout out to Lia for being sober. But holy shit it was embarrassing. I just knew everyone outside of stocks everyone was like yep he’s going to jail lmao. I didn’t though thankfully
441 2018-04-22 16:34:18 A company that Philip May works for has stocks in BAE systems. Are you suggesting that we shouldn’t take action because of that?
442 2018-04-22 16:34:04 Tax cut for middle class, pipe line, coal, more conservative judges, lowest black unemployment since LBJ, stocks highest in history, high...
443 2018-04-22 16:33:47 Ce pauvre type vient juste de se contredire. Bombarder les stocks de gaz  sans  morts. Il est où  le gaz ? Et en plus ils se moque des autres vieux cons alors que C'est le premier des vieux beaux a implants
444 2018-04-22 16:32:23 de façon générale les stocks d'hormones sont pas monnaie courante. Pour mon traitement en vu de PMA je devais souvent commander a l'avance. Jamais su si c'était parce que c'était très cher ou de la mauvaise volonté.
445 2018-04-22 16:32:13 If we were to use Bitcoin (BTC) as a sentiment gauge of market participant mood with 832 stocks reporting this week, I won't be surprise if bearishness changes and equities make a move up with BTC--> Hypothesis: Animal spirit & nature BTC movements with market participants
446 2018-04-22 16:31:43 Mounting dept, inflated earnings due to buybacks, yield curve issues, inflation mystery, leading stocks breaking down and FED unwinding it's balance sheet into a weak market. One has to wonder why this market is down 6% only from all time highs. Puzzling! #stocks
447 2018-04-22 16:31:32 Really cool place, puts on a great race no matter which class, Allison legacy to street stocks. Got my first oval win in a late model there, one of my favorites
448 2018-04-22 16:31:31 5 stocks on hand... I need some people coming from SUCAT, PARANAQUE CITY
bili kayo ng sabon ko tomorrow.
 Ano ba ang mahiwaga sa sabon na ito at bakit kaya niyang pailawin ang isang bombilya? 
Stop wondering, instead,  BUY.  What's with  our soap? Uulitin ko po 5  na lang po.
449 2018-04-22 16:30:44 hi, I've been watching your videos and I noticed you don't mention gold, I have an uncle who is an investor. he says that when the market is high gold is low and when the stock market is in a recession gold stocks go way up. is that true? can you talk about it in your next video?
450 2018-04-22 16:30:12 The economy was inching up, micro gains in jobs, mfg, stocks ... then Trump election and macro gains across the board, the cancellation of deals that weren't 'deals' at all and what you call a "tarrif war" we call not being the loser in every trade agreement. But ok ... Obama.
451 2018-04-22 16:29:21 Bro I have a pair about 6 feet from me right now in my room. I’ve had it since they dropped. It’s very ugly. I do like the inside part of the shoe design. That velouresque material on the inside heel area is groovy. But the shoe is just NOT ATTRACTIVE to me at all.
452 2018-04-22 16:29:17 Ha ha a camp Sheffield accent has never been so aggressive 
453 2018-04-22 16:27:49 So gold stocks order of the day here  #DateMyFamily
454 2018-04-22 16:27:08 I would dyor on stocks rather follow what I do. I got lucky with #FRR, and how about the dross I have traded over the last 18months, mainly due to no due diligence. There are far more out yonder who know more than lil ol me 
455 2018-04-22 16:26:44 What @rajasthanroyals lacking in this ipl is a westindies player,
No stocks or unadkat its Archer the key player , #RRvMI #MIvsRR
456 2018-04-22 16:26:40 You should hold the pair and see the details. That’s what I like on a shoe. Regardless of “hype”
457 2018-04-22 16:26:14 - here. How do you think that made us feel. We were abandoned by our leader, our other teammates gone. In just a few hours we were laughing stocks by other Grunts. Regina changed. Shes not the same anymore and its because you didnt at least trust her to express your stupid
458 2018-04-22 16:25:13 Ohh crap! I meant schiff pitchfork, I have been looking at major swings using Schiff pitch and it’s been interesting. I use log for all my BTC charting, but Out of curiosity, what timeframe for stocks do you consider short term, 3hr, 1 hr candles etc? Stock charting is new for me
459 2018-04-22 16:21:36 China & Russia, both going to asset backed currency (mostly gold) 
Which will make the Fiat (fake) Fed reserve notes even more worthless than they are now. May be a contributing factor to every one buying stocks and hard assets..
What happened to Sen Pauls audit the fed bill ?
460 2018-04-22 16:21:25 Bro if these weren’t some WAY-OVER-HYPED up release, they’d universally be on sale already.
461 2018-04-22 16:21:23 Everyone who has had a teenager knows that intonation is important.
The phrase "Yes, I cleaned my room" can be said in a way that will not please you.
Really.
The media gives reports on rising stocks and falling unemployment in a way that is designed to ....
Not please us, really
462 2018-04-22 16:20:32 The thesis on refrigerants in the US is interesting. Fact is there is that unlike stocks and the the exchanges for equities there is no imperial data on these chemicals. we tried to force EPA in 2014 to do a full data collection. NOT DONE
463 2018-04-22 16:19:47 Knives and handguns account for most of those murders. They don't make bump stocks for either of those weapons... While we're at it, why not regulate fists too because fists kill more children under 13 than guns and knives combined.
464 2018-04-22 16:19:33 @AskRobinhood Dear Staff, I am still completing my PhD but saw your opening for a social media manager. We should talk: there is real potential for Robinhood to produce a proprietary stream of briefs & articles on stocks. Would you consider an internship? I applied to the job.
465 2018-04-22 16:18:48 Porn and Stocks

Basically the only thing I talk about on here

Oh...and breast 

And fried chicken

471 2018-04-22 16:14:24 Today everyone seems to  be buying penny stocks 
472 2018-04-22 16:13:22 Yoh Ruth too much investment in gold stocks neh#DateMyFamily
473 2018-04-22 16:12:42 Just replied to a similar comment :D Actually not so badly, as my local-est library is pretty tiny and mostly stocks kids' books. Otherwise I'd be doomed!
474 2018-04-22 16:12:30 I stop buying shoes and started buying stocks it’s crazy what growing up will do for you
475 2018-04-22 16:12:23 And yet the NRA has resisted ever attempt to prevent the next mass shooting. The most common sense laws like background checks and banning bump stocks. Words aren't enough to stop senseless violence. The NRA are the biggest enablers of mass shootings.
476 2018-04-22 16:10:58 Exercise: what is your NETWORTH?
Calculate your net worth. 
Your net worth is your assets minus your liabilities and it gives you a snapshot of where you stand financially.1. Make a list of everything you own of value (stocks, property, land, fixed deposits, cash, gold).
477 2018-04-22 16:08:54 war is a racket

482 2018-04-22 16:02:37 The NRA refuses to support a ban on bump stocks. That is the the best evidence that they are extremists not interested in finding reasonable solutions.
483 2018-04-22 16:02:07 Maybe your investing on the wrong stocks you shpuld blame yourself for your own mistakes not others
484 2018-04-22 16:01:55 So ' you ' is best
485 2018-04-22 16:00:46 You obviously own no stocks and expect Big Govt to provide for you.  Keep drinking DEM Koolaid and die penniless
486 2018-04-22 16:00:44 Mhhmmmm I’m sure
487 2018-04-22 16:00:26 Comparative inventory (stocks of crude + selected products) minus 5 YA of same vs oil price.
488 2018-04-22 16:00:12 Because that’s pretty much is what it is....it starts with bump stocks and “assault rifles” then when nothing changes after that, they’ll go after the next thing. And the next. Until we end up like Britain stabbing and splashing acid on each other 
489 2018-04-22 15:59:35 What keeps stocks going with current rising rates? Continued earnings growth? Buybacks? Or recession ending in lowering of rates again?
490 2018-04-22 15:57:40 The Rich don't buy stocks or #Crypto they buy assets. Assets pay YOU!

493 2018-04-22 15:53:55 Don't talk Snyder anymore. Fed up of him and his fans. Completely destroyed DCEU and DC comics as a whole. Made a mockery of it. The greatest comic heroes have now become laughing stocks.
494 2018-04-22 15:53:54 Wednesday’s trading, which saw futures contracts that track the VIX spike 10% when U.S. stocks were rising, is intensifying concerns about the soundness of the entire ecosystem of VIX-linked trading...

496 2018-04-22 15:49:09 Important questions to ask about a business before investing in stocks
Is management good
Is market capital large 10000crore
Is it cheap Today
Is return good
497 2018-04-22 15:49:08 I think it could be a weakening of fiat currencies... Good for stocks, Gold and Crypto.
498 2018-04-22 15:45:33 £ still getting beaten up wary of shorts in stocks. Took back my Dignity, double bottom on daily, shooting/ evening star on icap in play, apart frm that close ur eyes and buy something (ice cream maybe)
499 2018-04-22 15:43:22 Sir Good has given you talent of identifying good companies stocks which perform reasonably well and a patience to wait till realisation. Hope u share the companies and guide us as not many of us would have that knowledge and help us in our lives improvement(for fee of course)
500 2018-04-22 15:43:02 Every GOP Republican whim takes money from the NRA the blood of these deaths are on your hands, no one is trying to take rights away the country wants to ban assault weapons, bump stocks if you have these guns you should We overseas fighting in wars these war mongers continue
501 2018-04-22 15:40:25 “How much did the stocks cost? The wood stocks.” “No idea. I had a gift card.”
502 2018-04-22 15:40:17 The largest font on that box says, CHICKEN. In my world, I'd expect a box that says CHICKEN on it, to contain, CHICKEN.
503 2018-04-22 15:36:57 One example would be advising millenials to buy blue chip stocks for security.  Single blue chips aren't much more safe than small growth companies since big companies mess up and go away periodically too.  Security comes from fixed income and broad mutual funds.
504 2018-04-22 15:36:02 According to the Investment Company Institute (ICI), 13% of the total market value of US stocks are held by index and exchange traded funds.

505 2018-04-22 15:34:00 I did. U don't understand. Corps just took the profits from sharing w/ employees to Wall St to please Analysts who call for a certain stock price. It wasn't like that then. They paid dividends bonuses etc. Price was minimal compared to Value. I worked in Stocks so I know.
506 2018-04-22 15:30:48 But our profits went up and Stocks through the roof, soo there is that.
507 2018-04-22 15:30:29 So the AR-15 is the culprit. I notice you don’t mention in many of those crimes the @fbi was made aware of the individual and did NOTHING! Why don’t you blame Obama for Vegas. It was Lord O who approved the sale of bump stocks? Oh those don’t meet your narrative.
508 2018-04-22 15:30:03 If u buy something based on ta, u r still gonna hope, that they stocks doesn’t give lower guidance and fuck up ur chart right? So I could argue ur still hoping even if u use the above mentioned tools.
509 2018-04-22 15:29:22 Doesn’t happen to you that you want to wear oversized clothing like Ari but she just stocks it and you look like you borrowed from your dad’s closet? Because it happens to me and it sucks

511 2018-04-22 15:26:20 Tell you what...

Once we have common sense gun laws that takes semi-automatic rifles out of civilian hands, that demand background checks for gun sales, & bans bump stocks & high-cap magazines.

Then MAYBE the "Dad w/gun" joke can be funny again.

518 2018-04-22 15:21:44 This is not true in the sense a President can establish tariffs on a whim and effect the entire economy - stocks, 401k - confusing investors and business planners. We don’t know yet what the 1.3 trillion spending bill entails - this is reducing gov power?
519 2018-04-22 15:19:24 You’re a bit selective with the gun violence crimes you choose to speak on. Any comment regarding MS13 or other gangs? Or the illegal alien from Saudi Arabia who had bump stocks at the Women’s March?
520 2018-04-22 15:18:22 We now have further reductions on 2017-18 season merchandise!

Save up to 50% on items while stocks last. There are heavily discounted replica shirts, T-shirts, polo shirts, umbrellas, golf balls and more! 

All items featuring the old club badge are included in the sale!
521 2018-04-22 15:15:39 I’d also like to see what stocks you have that have doubled recently? If you spent more time actually watching $SX vs bashing it on twitter your dumb ass could have bought in at sub .20 (even .14) and be sitting on a nice return... like $fat oh wait  bag holder
522 2018-04-22 15:13:47 Judge Linda Read’s husband investing in Prison stocks, is no different than Betsy Devos in private schools for profit, or Jeff Sessions invest. In Private Prisons #Reades record needs to be Examined her Victims retried @MotherJones @FreeGeorgeTonks #SWAMP

526 2018-04-22 15:12:14 Bump stocks DO NOT make a semi-automatic rifle into a machine gun! Get your facts straight. @swatcbs @CBSTweet @CNN
527 2018-04-22 15:11:25 Agreed, and even President Obama talked about lowering the corporate tax rate to 28%. But if people use repatriated cash and bonuses to, say, pay down personal or corporate debt or speculate in stocks or real estate, growth may not follow.
528 2018-04-22 15:11:21 Stocks plunged as Monsanto Company unveiled a balanced tube of lip balm today.
529 2018-04-22 15:11:12 Chip stocks had moved lower, mostly because of events related to a single stock. With the ETF connections and algorithmic trading, the entire sector got hit and dragged the market down as well.

535 2018-04-22 15:01:36 A long time ago, we were still America, not Amerussia, & Mother Earth, with her tectonic response to nuclear testing, did all the heavy lifting on changing Jong Un's mind. I suppose when stocks in air purifiers & bottled water rise, you'll pat yourself on the back for that, too.

542 2018-04-22 14:55:10 The shooting also stopped with ar15 . Maybe it would be more helpful if the rifle stocks were clear.  Then people would be so afraid of them. Also it only the black ones that do the killing...

551 2018-04-22 14:43:15 As an up until recently AR-15 owner bump stocks are basically just pointless ammo wasters. Never even mildly considered modifying my gun for that crap. Most reputable ranges would probably kick you out for using one anyway.
552 2018-04-22 14:42:54 Em 2017  aconteceu de Stocks bater em pneus na área de pit. Era visto que esse ano aconteceria outra vez.

555 2018-04-22 14:39:57 It quickly become obvious to me that stocks were following an algorithm using price and time. The squares provide a tool to see the algorithm(s). No one square tells everything. I need to watch many different square views to "guess" at the next move.

567 2018-04-22 14:27:18 Interesting research but we’re not looking to ban guns. We want to restrict high capacity magazines, bump stocks and introduce thorough background checks and waiting periods. This research doesn’t run counter to any of those.

577 2018-04-22 14:12:42 rate of return, so it's a farce. A lie to fool idiots. 
Second, I point out that stocks, that's what funds are based on, come from men like Trump who invest their money, create jobs and value, and fill needs for consumers. 
Without guys like him, you couldn't even make that lie.
578 2018-04-22 14:11:23 I think bump stocks are dangerous to use. Fully automatic guns are difficult to control. A cheap loose fitting stock makes them even worse.
579 2018-04-22 14:11:05 Where was all this outrage when the other #DemocratPlant shot up Las Vegas?  He used Bump Stocks to take out as many as possible & he took out over 50 - Where are all the kids protesting this?  That is my point - It has to fit the #LeftsNarrative!  Not one protest over that!

581 2018-04-22 14:09:05 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
582 2018-04-22 14:08:48 If that was the case, most of the funds saved by those “American Businesses” would have been utilized to provide HIGHER wage increases and not to buy back their own stocks, among other greedy choices. 
The intent may have been there, but your faith was misplaced in corporations.
583 2018-04-22 14:07:53 Many working class have pensions in stocks. That's still a win! 

However, many of our hourly or unemployed millennials have "invested" in crypto, using the college loan money they promised to pay back but don't want to. Do a story on how America will lose out because of them.
584 2018-04-22 14:07:14 A lot of Indian consumer stocks are now trading at more than 10 times sales. 

Amazon trades at 4. With 30% growth last year (and may be expensive). 

Google 7 times. 22% growth. It’s bizarre. Lets see how it turns out.

588 2018-04-22 14:04:26 Forex because it's the best for a small amount of money. From what I read, you need about $20,000 to get started with stocks. I also don't have an interest in stocks, which is why I'll probably never trade them
589 2018-04-22 14:02:32 Well, it’s has an expiration date - to make it permanent 75% of votes required and Democrats would not vote to reduce our taxes... The stocks buyback is great for my 401K - when companies back back their stocks the value of every share goes up.

591 2018-04-22 13:57:47 To me, it's a bit weird having the title, Chicken, along with a picture of a chicken, on something that contains no chicken. 
Kind of like, labeling something Champaign when it actually comes from Napa valley.

599 2018-04-22 13:48:19 The lack of response is confirmation that there is no logical reason for civilian access to AR15s, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks.

It is just a Pavlovian response "I want this toy and you can't stop me". So sad that you value your "wants" above the safety of our kids.

606 2018-04-22 13:37:54 Agree. They just don’t need high cap mags and bump stocks.

608 2018-04-22 13:37:04 So if the Packers pay a dividend, do they actually receive .002% of a dollar (0.2 cents) or do they need to own 10 shares to get their 2 cents and to have their voice heard? “Here’s my opinion that’s worth the dividend from 10 Packers stocks...”
609 2018-04-22 13:36:56 I’d rather the “bad guy” (this whole “good guy” with a gun bs is lame and tired) didn’t have access to military grade weapons, bump stocks, endless ammo, etc... 
610 2018-04-22 13:36:04 + shows to get word out? Worried scandal will rock the value on your stocks? Seems pretty unreasonable for someone who's just decided to take a break from her high profile family. Is that all she did, Mr. Godfrey?

631 2018-04-22 13:10:08 Mr A Perry’s new schooner will be launched this afternoon at 2 o’clock p.m. She has been rigged on the stocks and no doubt will present a fine appearance. Salmon River, Yar Co Apr 22 1897
632 2018-04-22 13:10:01 Canada passed that law too and it unfairly punishes plant based innovation in favour of same old processed meat value chains. Again it’s the vegans fighting to have good tasting, sustainable food for the rest of us. @FieldRoast was prob off market here for two months.
633 2018-04-22 13:09:36 Best economy by Obama? obama never had a single year of 3% growth and said that Trump “didn’t have a magic wand” and that all these jobs were NEVER coming back, yet here they are. Stocks at ALL TIME HIGH. And your minority comment is stupid. Best job market ever for them. 
634 2018-04-22 13:07:37 Actually we've taken a giant step forward. Best economy in history, record stocks, jobs up on every race, tax reform, building military back up, NOKO denuclearization, ISIS almost gone, MS13 almost gone, boarder safety and exposing the deep state!
635 2018-04-22 13:06:32 I think it’s the best time in many years to buy energy/commodity stocks yet I see very few people discussing it or who feel that way. Who knows if that call will be right...
636 2018-04-22 13:05:58 A lot of people who exemplify the attitude you gave before / even with further explanation still share the “knock it before you try it, bad texture.” Maybe y’all are wrong. Some of these products are great and must use “meat” in their marketing to convert people. E.g. Field Roast
637 2018-04-22 13:05:55 @SportAvecCanal svp corriger la prononciation du nom de la joueuse de Man City Demi Stokes non pas "stokizz" mais "dèmi stocks", merci bon match! 
638 2018-04-22 13:04:49 For fun I'll pick 5 stocks with poor @Stockopedia rankings that I believe will (collectively) outperform the market in the next year. #SDX (ranking 31) #MTR (ranking 15) #PCGE (ranking 9) #FLX (ranking 4) and #VAST (ranking 27). It'll be interesting to see how they perform.
639 2018-04-22 13:02:52 Fine, bump stocks, that’s just a gov  regulatory failure. Raise buying age, ok, but it must match the voting age. Background checks, ok, if you tie it to a national voter ID. There, we agree!! :)

644 2018-04-22 12:58:28 You're welcome, I think you can lose a lot of money in #AIM mining stocks if you're not careful. I also thought it was brilliant that you gave out the company directory, which shows the quality of companies attending!
645 2018-04-22 12:58:10 In terms of dividends ... or portfolio size growth of individual stocks...? lol
646 2018-04-22 12:57:29 That's an attitude that originates at highest level of gov't "Do I get to ignore,,, immigration laws, Constitution, lying to FBI, INSIDER TRADING of stocks, handling classified documents, oath of office, religious freedom, equal rights of majority as well as minority

650 2018-04-22 12:55:50 That’s my President! Shows what Americans really support. @POTUS thank you for doing this,  God Bless you and your family and protect you from the Evil you fight daily.
651 2018-04-22 12:53:59 I have a small trading account. I trade in cash/spot stocks mainly on margin.
652 2018-04-22 12:52:51 Yeah that’s not “denuclearization” until they eliminate their stocks of existing nukes and weapons-grade fissile material.

Thank you, please try again.
653 2018-04-22 12:52:27 Easy answer. Do not generate stocks. Use recicycle paper from packing with no colour. Re define the "just on time" in the food market. Regards.
654 2018-04-22 12:52:00 Investment is simple but not easy. It is difficult not to get intimidated by stocks with good returns in short term which might be unsustainable in the long term. @FI_InvestIndia @MashraniVivek
655 2018-04-22 12:51:26 This Week's Investors Chronicle is covering 100 to 51 of the biggest Stocks on AIM - usually worth a read if you can find a copy in WH Smith etc.

666 2018-04-22 12:40:03 Airbnb, home flippers, investors who use housing as if they are stocks, exclusionary zoning boards & those with the power to change this but have not; are all morally culpable for the dearth of decent & affordable housing in Boston & burbs, and for those who live on the streets.

669 2018-04-22 12:32:43 My post was about gun violence not defending oneself.  There is no need for the average person to own bump stocks or semi automatic weapons of any kind.  Those are weapons of war and unneeded by those who only want them for thrills or kills.
670 2018-04-22 12:31:01 This makes total sense to me. Just think about how many outdoor activities liberals enjoy and how many coolers @YETICoolers will sell them. Sell your Yeti stocks now kids. This was a major mistake to their core customers.
671 2018-04-22 12:30:48 @M_McDonough can you receommend a good platform for stocks with low capital entry requirement and good charts ?    I came in 8th in a trading contest with 100 experienced traders in 2008  (loved the volatility)...  Forex has been eating my lunch...

680 2018-04-22 12:22:11 It’s wasn’t the ongoing debt that killed Toysrus they were use to it. It was their last ditch attempt to push stores into malls and bigger retail parks. Stocks went down more that 2 percent and before you knew it they were no longer trading.

682 2018-04-22 12:21:34 The only thing changing is speculating without any fundamental clue. Even if room rates and occupancy increase; the value of the stocks is not going to multiply in the near term.
683 2018-04-22 12:17:22 Corbyn can't be bought which is why the establishment hate him. Theresa May on the other hand has a husband who's just made a killing with his stocks in the arms industry after the Syria bombing. Think it went up like 6,000 %.
684 2018-04-22 12:16:34 @mrondeau I've been trading stocks and currencies since 2000.   Getting back into stocks after a long break.... I like good charts... have always used cheapo platforms... can you recommend a platform / broker with good charts and low entry fee ?
685 2018-04-22 12:15:09 -reduced taxes for the rich. All other tax cuts are temporary & he added $1.3 trillion to the budget
-stocks were rising steadily for 6 years before Trump (thanks, Obama)
-he has not started building the wall. They’ve repaired EXISTING fence
-he hasn’t spoken to Kim yet /1
686 2018-04-22 12:15:01 6. Look for Opportunities to Invest
Check on the possibilities of investing in real estate, stocks or even in a business that may later be a source of income when you decide to retire or when your time of being an OFW runs out.

692 2018-04-22 12:08:40 Was big if you consider value erosion of almost 70% in all sugar stocks. After KRBL which he has kept buying eternally this is a puzzling situation. For Bannari Amman, true the quantity is puzzling but he holds >15% in all his co’s

699 2018-04-22 11:50:48 I don’t deny that there needs to be drastic changes to our diets and alternatives that help drive down meat consumption are needed - the issue here is with labelling and misleading consumers - something the French passed a law on this week

703 2018-04-22 11:47:01 I’ve not risen to any of the comments so far but this one has made me bite. I eat a mostly plant-based diet - my husband’s veggie and I eat meat maybe once a week, if that. I don’t eat plant-based meat-relacements like this because I dislike the texture
704 2018-04-22 11:43:34 Federal employee's have stocks in prison. They can support their generation to come from prison stocks, with their mandatory sentence.

730 2018-04-22 11:09:18 Even veggies, food inflation has been low. Nifty returns would be close to long term averages if one includes the anticipation rally. Real return on stocks would be decent if not good - it would be naive to deny that.
731 2018-04-22 11:08:19 I hope you had her put in the stocks.
732 2018-04-22 11:07:48 Yeah non-hyphenation is bad. 
Regardless we need more of that stuff in this world.
Most of the meat people eat isn’t recognizable as animal. Chicken strips? Hamburger etc.

736 2018-04-22 10:53:21 Hi, as a general thing I rarely short individual Stocks unless something really awful and in Bull Market even garbage can go up. In proper Bear Market I might Short Stocks but Indexes / Sectors probably easier. I will Short Index in Bull Market as tactical Hedge.
737 2018-04-22 10:45:46 I believe they take their foot off the gas when the stocks are fragile, which have been since Feb 2. They want to gradually reduce the balance sheet but if stocks dump, they can't. So they slow the cuts down and then play catch up. Why cuts in next 2 weeks will be interesting.
738 2018-04-22 10:45:34 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your ADHD

756 2018-04-22 10:09:12 My obsession is really with Hedging. It's extremely hard to keep a great Portfolio of Quality Stocks that you have built up when 'The Bear' properly returns  (as they always do). Hedging via Index Shorts is only solution really. And if Shorts work so should Longs.

894 2018-04-22 06:17:28 i just discovered a kpop mart beside the uni and of course, i had to check it out for BTS stuff. i asked if they have any BT21 merch, and the sales lady's answer bothered me so much. "oh we only have koya, mang, and van. try going back next week, we might have stocks"
895 2018-04-22 06:15:44 I wanna say that the best thing about the tourney from yesterday was that I dabbed on a dude between stocks when he taunted my death lmao
896 2018-04-22 06:15:24 I tried to buy some stocks with an extra 100 i saved and was absolutely appalled that most stock exchanges wont even let you get in without 10000 off top. How do they expect us to flip our money legally? Oh right, they dont.
897 2018-04-22 06:15:05 Now that’s funny.Into the stocks with you.

901 2018-04-22 06:09:21 Is finding low P/E and low P/B stocks are value investing? if it is so then @screener_in only will do the job. It can give us cheap stocks, but value of stocks, we have to calculate. @shyamsek @safalniveshak #ValueInvesting and that is most difficult job..

924 2018-04-22 05:21:04 meets resistance because one person made $ so they can't see how over the long term it goes nowhere. The average return is deceptive. The same thing happens with stocks. Depending on when you (the individual) buys, means some make 20% some lose 30%. But the average is 2%!

927 2018-04-22 05:15:53 Sir but the problem is understanding the P/E multiple that the market is valuing the business at. Some good companies with excellent ROEs like Auro pharma are at beaten down valuation for quite some time. Beyond a point investors lose their patience with such stocks.
928 2018-04-22 05:14:58 There's theft also in developed countries with high per capita income.
As in stocks, averages don't explain what happens at boundaries. Nor are sexual crimes a simple "women are victims of sex, men are benefactors"
But media uses what's easy to manipulate sentiments of public.

933 2018-04-22 04:44:03 Sure..will share more info on systems and also post my stocks momo system similar to urs but not as good.
934 2018-04-22 04:42:21 Yes it's a mixture of different types of systems. Prblm with these systems is some of them have small edge (avg%profit)..which can go if we don't run them properly.  I still allocate more money to momo systems on stocks similar to urs and Alok's because the edge is quite big der.

964 2018-04-22 03:41:58 Well I used to trade stocks a lot more and the fact that the market was only open 5 days a week for about 8hrs helped us turn it off. The 24hr trading is adding to the compulsive checking of prices. I catch myself doing it too.

I am very bullish on selected energy and health care in the very long term too. I am wary of most stocks related to the consumer. As prices go down, risk does too.

1016 2018-04-22 02:08:49 Santi, how is it in Argentina? Can't someone open up a broker's account and trade stocks? Here people can do it (USA), although you need, say, $3K or more to borrow on margin.

1022 2018-04-22 01:56:36 In a lot of countries there are a lot of red tape to buy stocks, things that are everyday occurrence in the US like opening an e*Trade account are impossible for ordinary people in countries like Argentina.
1023 2018-04-22 01:56:11 And I’m embarrassed for my neck on Evian sweetheart Bartenders asking me the orphan stocks are my designer cigarettes?

1027 2018-04-22 01:52:02 What part is baloney? Trump is very anti gun, he's for banning bump stocks by giving the ATF broader authority to expand their judgement on what they believe should and shouldn't be legal. He also talked to feinstein about her assault weapons bill.
1028 2018-04-22 01:50:01 Good morning 
1029 2018-04-22 01:47:01 @CNBCFastMoney @HalftimeReport @CNBC bullish for energy stocks !!
1030 2018-04-22 01:45:56 with 44 million neopoints in the bank you get 15k daily interest and can buy stocks for "free" (like without needing to get nps in games lol)

1033 2018-04-22 01:43:16 Because I'm feeling pretty good, here's a few stocks I'm bringing up in our #InvestingClub in May as of in the now are $TXN, $TSM, $SWKS, $NVDA, & $MPWR. There you go buddy. Hopefully helpful & #BeFuckingAwesome 
1034 2018-04-22 01:43:11 If Jesus were here. He would buy all the bump stocks. Paul Ryan is toast.
1035 2018-04-22 01:42:38 Ps, I tweet about 10-12 stocks a week, I own far for than $fat. Enjoy.
1036 2018-04-22 01:42:33 I have extensive knowledge and history in OTC stocks.  Reverse mergers, Form A filings to get  listed and market making. Jason is 100% right on this imo. Stay away from them.
1037 2018-04-22 01:41:47 Good thing fish and game stocks America's streams so that you over privileged brats can catch them and then cry about regulations designed to protect wildlife.  Such a hypocrite.
1038 2018-04-22 01:41:46 Only thing I would say Fundamental is better for is Bio stocks. TA can get blown out like no other. A few other exceptions, but IMO TA is stronger than ever with Algos taking over also.
1039 2018-04-22 01:37:22 So give me a couple stocks you like I can study on
1040 2018-04-22 01:34:37 Good point Van. Their stocks of trustworthy representatives are paper thin.
1041 2018-04-22 01:33:17 I had a busy day... my gripe is with gov, who don’t use the laws on the books as written. Delaney Tarr went right to my point in her speech at the march. “Gave us an inch on bump stocks, we want a mile!” Feinstein- “take em all”.  Compromise isn’t desired; its delete 2nd for them
1042 2018-04-22 01:30:03 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. #tradeforex #stocks
1043 2018-04-22 01:27:25 So apparently Dick's Sporting Goods will be destroying their remaining stocks of AR style rifles rather than selling them. Since we've been told these are the very "weapons of war" that the military uses, why aren't they being donated for combat use by our armed forces? Hmmm...
1044 2018-04-22 01:25:25 Dividend-paying tokens require that we trust profit reports, and unlike stocks, there's no legal framework.  What about a dividend paying token that taxes revenue automatically?  It better be well-calibrated, as it would pay off even if the company is running a loss.
1045 2018-04-22 01:24:41 whatever it was Dan,may really have been the clean bowel movement,but it was announced and many well seasoned investers both dems and rebubs are posturing themselves as pot stocks are set to sore as a result.Let’s just see what happens-time will tell
1046 2018-04-22 01:17:16 Also read more recent articles from the same source. You will see unemployment has stagnated at 4.1%. Companies are not reinvesting their savings from the tax breaks. Instead they are buying back stocks & giving out extra payments to stock holders.
1047 2018-04-22 01:16:28 Yes RT @MilftasticJJC: 4. If your child asked you for $50 to invest penny stocks, would you give it to him or her?
1048 2018-04-22 01:15:49 Well I am still learning what you trade is it options, stocks,forex,futures just big board or otc I am small time still lol are you a chart guy?
1049 2018-04-22 01:15:37 oh don't worry. those stocks will be sold. just counting down the days. the increased censorship only accelerates the process, i assure you

1051 2018-04-22 01:11:25 You don’t see Beyoncé because people were dragging her for her old interviews so she shied away from them. Plies is a man. Men respect other men. They do the exact same thing to Tiffany haddish. Making black women laughing stocks has always been the move.
1052 2018-04-22 01:09:24 The so-called “Billionaire Boys Club” of the 1980s got rich quick through what?
1) Penny stocks
2) Ponzi schemes ✓
3) Junk bonds
1053 2018-04-22 01:09:01 Black people would get further in white american if we stayed educated about the important things like financial freedom, stocks, debt .
1054 2018-04-22 01:08:46 no poster tube pa :> and also i can still accept orders for this naman but di pa guaranteed ang poster depende pa sa stocks
1055 2018-04-22 01:05:48 I think it gives newer generations an opportunity to control their assets from a different way. Stocks are still head-scratching and there are no videos or books to how to invest in them.
1056 2018-04-22 01:05:28 Buy oil stocks !
1057 2018-04-22 01:00:09 If you invested $1 each in stocks and gold in 1801, by 1998 you'd have over $500K in stock and 78 cents in gold.
1058 2018-04-22 00:53:24 @CashtroMarley well there has to be room for price fluctuation. Whoever tells you he has stop 1% on stocks lower than $5.00 is lying

1063 2018-04-22 00:46:01 Gold is a good way to save. Bitcoin is currently a good way to invest but will become merely a good way to save at some point. Stocks are a great way to invest.
1064 2018-04-22 00:45:52 Now allow me allow this tidbit.. as stocks bonds markets collapse... the CREDIT will stops and in this all commence will stop and stores go empty 3 days. 
FUCK YES.. stores go empty 3 days.. we public dies weeks after's and the Globalist Elitist inherits the spoils.

1068 2018-04-22 00:39:12 You can make millions too. Albeit, it'll be off weed stocks on the Canadian stock exchange. 
1069 2018-04-22 00:37:06 I believe Bonds will drop as we see demand for stocks rise. Earnings will be the driving force along with demand, such as buybacks, then add infrastructure spending and tax reform benefits.
1070 2018-04-22 00:36:02 The stocks maybe but not confinement. Just my opinion.
1071 2018-04-22 00:34:00 Today it's #Day100 of #365daysofvalue!!!!!!! I analyzed Berkshire Hathaway . The share price is $300,140. What's your opinion? #valueinvesting #investing #stocks #TwitterPoll
1072 2018-04-22 00:31:48 Agree completely. I like taking profits and scaling out as I make money. Sometimes stocks come back to earth and you lose vast amounts of important money.
1073 2018-04-22 00:31:41 Real stuff? You mean stocks that are manipulated by Wall Street analysts every day?
1074 2018-04-22 00:29:27 Sure. this is me getting memed by people who make stocks with FM7a 
1075 2018-04-22 00:23:12 She does also sell merch, which tons of people (or their parents) purchase, and which she’s sold out of multiple times. Videos aren’t her only source of income. She could also be doing what many other youtubers do and putting money in stocks.
1076 2018-04-22 00:22:27 Bump stocks are very inefficient for firing and make it harder to aim. Very little people will buy bump stocks.
1077 2018-04-22 00:21:08 My worst lab nightmare is my fly stocks tossing their alleles. What is your worst lab nightmare? #lab #fruitfly
1078 2018-04-22 00:19:51 @kylewdennis 1) do you short stocks? U started trading after the crash of 2008. So market is recovering. But if another crash comes, buying stocks then is going against the market. So will you short stocks or just stay out?
1079 2018-04-22 00:19:10 6 sprint cars 21 modifieds 11 Street stocks 9 Outlaw tuners
1080 2018-04-22 00:17:03 There’s no such thing as a gun show loop hole it’s been debunked time and time again. There are already background checks. The NRA isn’t against banning bump stocks and neither am I. I haven’t watched Fox News in a long time.
1081 2018-04-22 00:15:44 For me banning bump stocks and other such modifications is the baby step.
1082 2018-04-22 00:15:12 Here's the problem. The kids are not asking to take all your guns. That is NRA propaganda. Background checks, gun shows loop holes, bump stocks. Stop listening to NRA & Fox News and think for yourself.

1085 2018-04-22 00:05:58 ive mentioned it several times on here, stocks live on iOS
1086 2018-04-22 00:02:52 I have seen stocks run hard even after a reverse split. Look at ARGS
1087 2018-04-21 23:58:17 Even though handguns account for ten times as many deaths as rifles, you are most concerned with mass shootings, bump stocks, semi automatic rifles, and high capacity magazines? Where is this common sense you were talking about?

1123 2018-04-21 23:33:43 2019/20 is good. One sideline issue is that $JD and $BABA might get listed on the Chinese market sometime 'soon'. That would likely really help increase demand for both stocks.

1139 2018-04-21 23:13:10 Can you buy any weapon you want.  No.  That is because some commonsense gun laws already prohibit it.  Bump stocks and fat cranks should be added.  High capacity drums as well.

1148 2018-04-21 22:57:22 The AR15 is not a weapon of war it’s never been used in war, and bump stocks don’t make the gun fully automatic, the weapon itself is still semi auto, it just allows you to use the recoil to shoot faster but you can do so without a bump stock

1153 2018-04-21 22:52:20 All there is to #investing is picking good stocks at good times and staying with them as long as they remain good companies. #WarrenBuffett
1154 2018-04-21 22:46:10 Many gold and silver  buyers, at least in my age group (old), like the comfort and the tactile feel of the actual ore. I'm not sure it will supplant ore as a safe haven.  As for myself ; I'll stick with stocks and cash.

1158 2018-04-21 22:40:57 Yup. Just dollar cost average a stock with high dividends, every month & ur golden.

I don’t touch growth stocks, with high P/E ratios - not worth it. Unless u like to gamble, then go right ahead.
1159 2018-04-21 22:40:09 So NVDA NFLX AAPL ISRG will be kicked to the curb? If so, which stocks besides FSLR will be the new leaders?

1164 2018-04-21 22:35:37 And what of many tech stocks that never pay dividends (Goog?) Scam? Ok we've beaten this horse enough. $tslaq guys like to be argumentative, even with non-Tesla subjects, it seems  PS feel free to have the last word

1168 2018-04-21 22:30:53 It's almost like @CNN endorsed @jimmy_dore..  On the other hand, CNN's only area of support is among the sheeple of America. Outside the country, they now take their place with the other Media laughing stocks.. Spend 30min watching @RT_com & the differences are blatant..
1169 2018-04-21 22:29:57 Kick backs from the Drug Lord's will keep the Border wide open for a long long time. Even poorly paid government officials need New Summer Homes, cars, stocks, Bonds, etc.etc.

1180 2018-04-21 22:11:12 Awesome. I'm talking more for Crypto. For stocks I have heard horror stories. That's why I use TD Ameritrade
1181 2018-04-21 22:10:11 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1182 2018-04-21 22:09:15 @Molly3186 also I’ll let you give Obama credit for 2017 also, 2.3% isn’t all that great. It was up from his 1.5%. 3%+ is the mark we want.   Over all stocks are up, taxes are down, more people working, fairer trade, manufacturing coming back. Those are Trumps facts. #MAGA
1183 2018-04-21 21:59:12 @swatcbs OMG! Isn’t demonizing bump stocks on the show easy to do? A show that has guns and shootings every week is anti gun? LOL#hypocrites
1184 2018-04-21 21:58:41 And did you note the qualifier "%50 of people who own stock", that means people without stocks get zilch. %50 of 0 is still 0!

1186 2018-04-21 21:55:03 It will be like stocks eventually. Or so I hope. IPO s are untouchable by us the common people and ICO s are an inspiring opportunity despite the scams

1190 2018-04-21 21:50:27 What securities would you trade?  Stocks?  Bonds?  Forex?  Beanie Babies?
1191 2018-04-21 21:49:48 That's retail common stock. Follow the stocks you have money in & forget the Dow. Read about the companies to see CEO/COO changes, lawsuits (Audit Letters in the Annual Report), etc. If you're young, you don't need the money for 30-40 years. I've seen oil at $9/bbl & now it's up.
1192 2018-04-21 21:49:12 The NASDAQ looks more like an H&S, but I've found that H&S formations in the indexes don't mean all that much - ultimately it all boils down to what individual stocks have been doing...e.g., my short ideas in $AMAT and $NVDA over the past week have worked well...
1193 2018-04-21 21:48:13 Well, if this goes thru, i can see a boom in food company stocks...
1194 2018-04-21 21:43:49 I want fucked up paper stocks so I can do old ads and make it feel like it.

Khan pisses Brook in my opinion at any weight under 150lbs
1197 2018-04-21 21:38:24 You almost gotta be a day trader when it comes to Cryptocurrency and stay up on the latest news, after all it's like stocks.
1198 2018-04-21 21:38:18 Hey meathead , I believe we’re both fighting at this point that a bump stock ban is stupid , to think there popular and easy to use is foolish , totally agree that they are inching there ban to include all auto , point being bump stocks bang you up and are great to look at

1200 2018-04-21 21:27:12 If an expert or pundit gets something wrong to a ridiculous degree they should have a turn in the stocks. I remember Rodney Marsh having to shave his head when he wrongly predicted Bradford would go down . More of this please
1201 2018-04-21 21:25:47 @jitenkparmar I believe it is better to own @HDFC_Bank stocks then hold a account in their branch. This will result in wealth creation

1230 2018-04-21 21:10:08 Now I think you're just another gun idiot. Putting a piece of metal before lives. Totally changed my view of you. Just a dumb Trumper. Nothing wrong with guns for hunting and protection but no one needs bump stocks or semi autos. You're not in the military any more.

1296 2018-04-21 20:45:25 This is why FIRE movmnt is the equiv to Warren Buffet's "buy and hold" strategy for stocks.

1313 2018-04-21 20:28:22 نعم الله يجزاك خير
1314 2018-04-21 20:24:46 I'm a purist. I just want him drawn & quartered in town square... oops there goes my filter again!
What I meant to say is that I would like to see Sean Hannity eat his words in public & maybe self-flagellate, then be put in the stocks. Ha!
...& see @FoxNews go down the drain.
1315 2018-04-21 20:24:12 Hah!  In fairness, I don't use it often. Mostly to check stocks and for home automation controls. I try to use various other widgets but they usually don't work well enough to continue using them.
1316 2018-04-21 20:23:57 Yes, crazy isn’t it? The manufacturer’s in New Zealand, I wonder if it’s faced much criticism. @CheyStein2 can you enlighten us?
1317 2018-04-21 20:23:55 1/Sometimes, sure. But more often than not, they lobby for unpopular policy under the guise of 2A that has a direct effect on gun manufacturers’ profit margins. Bump stocks are a recent example. Overwhelmingly, NRA, the populace, and lawmakers were on board to ban them...until
1318 2018-04-21 20:21:42 I seem to have a good sense. Turned 150 into 8k last year on bitcoin.  Pulling ahead in stocks too.
1319 2018-04-21 20:19:34 No problem i already entered those
Stocks.same problem..Can't disclose
Want to buy more.

1389 2018-04-21 20:07:54 Opportunity to bleed the USA dry of its crude stocks.  Very little spare capacity globally. Continue to defer capex until trump shuts up. OPEC + in the drivers seat now. Gartman? Kudlow? Morse from Citigroup? Had enough of the “we are swimming in oil”.
1390 2018-04-21 20:05:19 Your opinion needs updating by adding facts.
Facts don't care about your feelings.

'Assault weapons' is a nothing term.
The Left keeps calling for a ban on AR-15s and bump stocks, but funnily enough forget to check facts.
That 60~70% of gun deaths are suicides, for instance.

1402 2018-04-21 19:52:07 You do realize stocks and bonds is how your pension is largely funded and that includes CPP.  For currency exchanges that allows companies to do business as well as if you've ever travelled you needed that.  On cars I am fine with that but should be 100K not 60K.
1403 2018-04-21 19:50:52 Cute or in the stocks?

1474 2018-04-21 19:44:25 That’s your perception. I only pointed out that reporters from some of those networks didn’t bother to mention their spouse’s involvement with political campaigns when they were interviewing the associated candidates.

It’s like financial reporters failing to reveal their stocks.
1475 2018-04-21 19:43:47 بخير ونعمة جعلك بخير يا خوي
الجنون يخف تدريجياً

1480 2018-04-21 19:39:56 Great service but yes lots of out of stocks
1481 2018-04-21 19:37:13 Bump stocks should be illegal.

ANY gun that can slaughter dozens in minutes should be illegal. They are NOT "family friendly" in any way.
1482 2018-04-21 19:33:36 Just remembering that meeting at the WH between Trump, DeVoss, survivors of a mass school shooting & grieving parents, siblings, & friends. Trump thought raising the age, banning bump stocks, & common sense gun laws should help.Productive? He listened? Acted? Teachers with guns..
1483 2018-04-21 19:33:14 21 And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men, serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones and stocks the incommunicable name.
1484 2018-04-21 19:33:13 you’ve got me goin

1486 2018-04-21 19:32:17 Uh no it will passed through to the American tax payer through increase on goods coming in. They also added 1.9 trillion to the debt. Companies have also started to buy back stocks. Trickle down has never worked. Business will always be about their bottom line.
1487 2018-04-21 19:31:14 But bump stocks are still legal
1488 2018-04-21 19:23:16 Ipswich!   Do me a favour. In Ipswich these deviants would be put in the stocks and pelted with cabbages by fishermen.
1489 2018-04-21 19:20:14 Some people dig on Crocs. Some on Stocks. 

You’ll notice I have never criticized your footwear.
1490 2018-04-21 19:20:13 My portfolio is  50:50 aka cash at fixed return : stocks..on a weekly basis I buy more stocks at a rate of 15% of my salary. I’m not sure what ur suggesting that I do differently since we are approaching the fabled death cross. If it goes down I will make a lump sum buy. advice?
1491 2018-04-21 19:16:33 I set up the whole account and everything, but liked the safety of regular stocks. But definitely worth serious consideration.
1492 2018-04-21 19:12:42 صديقي كيف حالك 
ربما تكون العملات الرقمية اكثر عقلانية بنسب الصعود مقارنة ب 2017 الذي شهد ارتفاع باكثر 12000% 

ولكن ستبقى الاكثر جاذبية في نسب صعود مقارنة بكل الاسواق والسلع كمثال بسيط شهر ابريل شهد صعود لبعض العملات تجاوز 80~100%
1493 2018-04-21 19:08:39 Hey it was late in day when I responded & hope you did not misconstrue my reply as being dismissive of your inquiry.  PM mkt is long overdue for change in direction and $SILVER is my main focus.  We have multiple confirmed ratio chart breakouts & 52wk highs in select stocks. 
1494 2018-04-21 19:07:31 The first 2 you asked for are already a thing, bump stocks do absolutely nothing, and banning a 30rd magazine won’t stop someone from obtaining it illegally if they don’t already have them
1495 2018-04-21 19:04:46 agenda you can control destiny!

If you can control young and older adults to follow your agenda you can eliminate those who don't suit your agenda by fabrication of war and increase dividends from munitions stocks to fill your pockets with diamonds!

1496 2018-04-21 19:04:08 Being an outsider in there pelted,  it’s seems that the money men care more about how stocks and shares work  rather then the old fashion my dad took me and his dad took him,  tbh I blame Chelsea and Man City for chasing Moon beams
1497 2018-04-21 19:03:22 Fake credits r not about frauds. Itis about currencies like GAS which have no real WORK beside them. It is like selling money to a higher price. The mark up is a fake credit. Itcuzes unstableity. Specially if u take it to stocks and ppl overbuy the VOID. This is what made
1498 2018-04-21 19:03:15 in 2nd grade I sang womanizer by britney spears as one banana
1499 2018-04-21 19:01:39 Super speculative. But, isn’t investing in a tiny market cap company on NYSE too? Or penny stocks? I think so at least. Manipulation can be an issue, but i think you’ll have that with any new asset class. I mean Soros shorted the GBP and is credited for breaking Bank of England.
1500 2018-04-21 19:01:02 He’s done some much more good, a few missteps are excusable. Paychecks up. Stocks up. Taxes down. NK might be willing to stop with their nuke program. Liberal talking heads called that one wrong too.

1502 2018-04-21 18:57:36 Check August 2007. Stocks were about to get crushed and long bonds  yields were double topping.
1503 2018-04-21 18:55:57 Warner Buffet was asked what if all the prices fall to the ground? He replied I buy more from what I like. He was asked again what if they really drop to almost zero. He said I buy more from what I like. This is rule to the stocks market
1504 2018-04-21 18:54:26 Middle income people make money off of stocks, and many Americans are being hired by corporations now so their jobs flowing instead of your socialist president Obama who stifle the economy and gave away the middle class Americans income to the bottom feeders
1505 2018-04-21 18:53:34 When I look at the near future, I see a whole new economical structures. Companies formation will change. Share holdings will change. Stocks will change. It's obvious to anyone who understand the #decentralized of things. #[DOT] the movement is growing.
1506 2018-04-21 18:52:29 You do not need to be accredited to buy stocks. Try to read the thread you’re replying to.
1507 2018-04-21 18:51:40 Exactly. This is why explaining how trade measures can help address global probs is vital, eg #trade disciplines can halt declining fish stocks (by eliminating subsidies) & help tackle #climatechange - eliminate #fossilfuel subsidies. Trade=real action not just warm rhetoric

1511 2018-04-21 18:44:59 Yes this is the philosophy of stocks. If u see the documentary of Robert Reich "inequality for all" he says that the stocks cuz unstabaliety in the economy. I agree with him.

1535 2018-04-21 18:23:26 Background checks before buying guns. Banning of assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks. They would not be able to buy these things. It is not a “follow or not”. It is set in stone.

1551 2018-04-21 18:09:31 True, we have had school shootings in Canada. Since 1975 there have been 11. That is 1 every 4 years. For starters, high capacity clips, bump stocks, guns like AR-15's all need to be eliminated. Open and concealed carry need to be abolished, in my opinon. Stop glamourizing guns.

1564 2018-04-21 17:52:04 I can completely understand your point.  I just disagree with your opinion on letting current gun laws stand the way they are and instead investing in more security so people can keep their AR’s and bump stocks and lenient gun laws.

1572 2018-04-21 17:39:38 Stocks are still cheap.  And slower earnings growth is not caused by any fundamental problem whatsoever, so you’re making a negative out of a positive.

1602 2018-04-21 17:00:48 Bump Stocks have no tactical purpose or use. They certainly were not used in the Las Vegas shooting.

1611 2018-04-21 16:53:06 And bump stocks weren't even used in the shooting.  The result of the power of the fake news media and the gullibility and sheepishness of the public to believe and act on its perpetrated lies.

1625 2018-04-21 16:41:19 Kanye just dey make twitter dema stocks shoot. No wonder Jack himself personally welcomed him when returned to twitter. 

Talk about a social media influencer and this is it. Not your 20k slay queens like trash Kings who won’t let us hear word.
1626 2018-04-21 16:40:44 Israel is alleged to be using chemical called “green gas” on Palestinians. Does anyone have info on this? Trump authorized air strikes on Syria for chemical weapons on civilians. Was that proven? Or did he want stocks to go up?

1630 2018-04-21 16:36:31 ISIS dying out is a result of many nations not just the US, he just happens to be the leader. As for China, stocks had dropped a decent amount and we might be going back to the TPP. As for sex trafficking what you’re saying is too broad.
1631 2018-04-21 16:36:14 Market cap of FAANG Stocks =$ 3 Trillion ( 20th April close )

Rather than making fun of Pakistan one should concentrate on how to up their own game DAMN IT!

أعتقد ان أي أرتدادة "كما هو متوقع" قد يسجل معها السهم هذا السعر والعلم عند الله
1633 2018-04-21 16:35:20 I actually listened to that one first. I found it interesting that he’s not a Bitcoin holder & prefers holding stocks as a hedge against inflation instead.

وان شاء الله الامور طيبة
اذا كنا نراهن على انعكاس قريب في الإتجاه الحالي فالسهم مرشح لإستعادة جزء من خسائره إن شاء الله

1638 2018-04-21 16:31:58 Great, thanks for your feedback. I agree on Energy Fuels and am long. Also own NexGen on a much smaller scale due to the quality of the deposit. IMO it's very hard to pick which stocks will be the big movers down here. Retail seems fascinated with GXU and UEC given all the promo.
1639 2018-04-21 16:26:51 و للاسف الشديد خسارتي فادحه جدا جدا
1640 2018-04-21 16:26:09 مع العلم اني اخدت السهم على 1.56
1641 2018-04-21 16:24:54 هل حضرتك بتنصح الاستمرار الاحتفاظ بالسهم او التخلص منه
1642 2018-04-21 16:24:21 يعني حضرتك شايف انه السهم نازل ؟؟
1643 2018-04-21 16:24:12 Good for all Bro....On Fun Side Looks Both Kim and Trump Jodi bought huge stocks/futures on Friday  on dips in market.... so that market can jump with this positive news on Monday/new week :):)

1645 2018-04-21 16:21:38 Have u ever discovered Stock Markets?
In that market u have fundamental n technical observations on shares. Then invest on their future.
Now if u mix it with High-Risk investment it would be the cryptomarket.
I am not happy with currencies behaved like stocks. But this is it.
1646 2018-04-21 16:19:11 How’s that go with his shifting gun control stance, push to ban bump stocks, and close the doors of companies like SlideFire, killing jobs?

How is it compatible with going into Syria without evidence, supporting ISIS, & lying to us about being antiwar by hiring neocons?
1647 2018-04-21 16:18:12 today in dumb hot takes: "If you don't own stocks, you're not part of the American economy"

1652 2018-04-21 16:14:15 Except in Vegas... those bump stocks the NRA helped put in the hands of the killer so his guns effectively functioned as fully automatic weapons.

You could ask the almost 900 country fans 1 man killed and injured, except some of them can no longer speak.
1653 2018-04-21 16:12:14 FYI: you can now Trade stocks using the robinhood app, currrently with 0$ in commission for them!

This would include pharmaceuticals that sell meds or pay out insurance for black lung or Mesothelioma. José says vote the GOP out on 11/6 his birthday!
1676 2018-04-21 15:54:21 He invested in a bunch of stocks several years ago and they obviously succeeded LOL
1677 2018-04-21 15:52:19 remember those headers? Lololol I don’t care about packs dude seriously. You’re really disgusting, your prolly gunna go steal stocks and say you made em
1678 2018-04-21 15:52:16 And the FACT is, the NRA enabled bump stocks to effectively function as a fully automatic weapon. 

Ask the nearly 900 people killed and injured in a few minutes by 1 man  just a few months ago.
1679 2018-04-21 15:51:52 I have been investing in stocks and bonds since 07.  The one thing I do for every trade is to have an exit strategy or target prices to lock in gains and prices to cut losses.  Congrats on your gains. Remember they are only on paper till you lock them in.

1682 2018-04-21 15:48:01 You're funny. If Rump Actually accomplished just ONE of those things you mentioned, I might give him an "atta boy," but he hasn't. No proof of Kim suspending anything, only folks helped by tax plan, are wealthy & thru are buying their company  stocks back.

1684 2018-04-21 15:45:10 Basically they do now, by allowing Bump-Stocks - combined with an AR15 which can be purchased at your 18th birthday - Walk in & Walk out armed to the teeth...

1690 2018-04-21 15:40:43 @realDonaldTrump @jimcramer As opposed 2 your avg day investor choosing stocks while bank traders choose ETFs due to lack of skill, why not flip it, and make it a SEC rule. The typical investor without inside knowledge is allowed ETFs, but banks must invest in stocks only.
1691 2018-04-21 15:39:56 That's your choice. But there are many ppl out there that don't have the know how or are tech savvy enough to manage a digital wallet for BTC hence the option to simply buy stocks and indirectly be in crypto is a better option. I do both.
1692 2018-04-21 15:39:32 Sweet that the company that makes bump stocks have decided to stop doing so. Awesome response to changing cultural norms and values. Lives > murder toys
1693 2018-04-21 15:38:12 For stocks, particularly IPOs; and typical bonds, S-O seems to still be an effective deterrent to corruption. But this new form of securities of packaged mortgages was beyond the scope, and under Bush, the SEC didn't  update the regulations.

1697 2018-04-21 15:30:11 FYI, civilian ownership of automatic weapons has been illegal since 1986 and bump stocks don’t make a semi auto firearm fully automatic, there has to be a change to the internal workings of the gun. Be a responsible journalist and fact check things before you broadcast
1698 2018-04-21 15:30:01 NRA teaches gun safety. Why is it their job to stop the killing?  Why aren’t you blaming Law enforcement for not doing thorough investigations. What about President Obama who did nothing for 8 years. Trump got rid of bump stocks which Obama ok’d.

1703 2018-04-21 15:25:53 Wow!  Well, this is certainly not good news.  I will argue that ToyRUs stocks a lot of inventory, some of it popular, and some of it not.  I find it hard to believe that ALL of the inventory in these stores will be sold for its intended value.
1704 2018-04-21 15:25:46 Kinda ironic that the article written by the former POTUS didn’t mention he was the one who approved bump stocks as legal because they had no moving parts or springs.... And why no mention of the kids who support 2A?
1705 2018-04-21 15:23:31 Make plan against Sanju,stocks, butler,rahane
1706 2018-04-21 15:23:00 But you can’t do the same thing, bump stocks are considerably more accurate because you can fire from the shoulder and aim, belt loop is spray and pray.
1707 2018-04-21 15:22:55 Care for an interesting IPO? nLIGHT $LASR is coming to the @Nasdaq next week with an estimated price of 13-15 dollar. Semiconductors are hot stocks!
1708 2018-04-21 15:22:03 While I don't own one due to their lack of usability I would encourage all owners to hold fast with their bump stocks as this is an infringement to the 2A.  We have relapsed to a state of firearms accessory banning.

As someone who has been ordering from your site and shopping from your stores ,I think it is extremely concerning ....
1712 2018-04-21 15:17:48 I was wondering if you picked up any oil stocks as they seemed to be on a tear lately? And are you still holding retail names?

1719 2018-04-21 15:12:28 Worse can be said of #Cannabis stocks. Many selling at 100 times sales. And with regulatory framework round the corner these valuations can collapse.
1720 2018-04-21 15:12:18 I just sold my stocks today and the money should hit my account within 3 days. So IF he’s not gone by then,yes  if so, I can always find another. The site has lots of great pups but this was one of the cheapest I’ve seen.

1757 2018-04-21 14:36:20 TBH I could care less what happens to Starbucks (but clearly nothing drastic will happen until their stocks take a hit). I don't even like coffee, I like the frappuccino. But the way they treat certain folks is clearly discriminatory, especially ones who look "lower class".

When you put shoes in what order you do it? You put stocks first and then shoes or sock-shoe and then the other sock-shoe?

Police can’t identify bad guys if teachers have guns too.
How about universal BG checks, banning bump stocks & voting out politicians bought/paid for by gun lobby?
1788 2018-04-21 14:08:18 Hmmm, so another area police reporting might have been off?  It was the police thru media that said he did not use the bump stocks?

1808 2018-04-21 13:51:24 haven't tried that, no. I like Robinhood though. Probably because it's easy and no fees. there are stocks that are less than $5 too if you want :)
1809 2018-04-21 13:50:40 I don't own a gun so like listening to people who do.   That is how I try to make decisions.  In case of the bump stock I listened to that teen in DC that said "today we take bump stocks tomorrow we take your guns"   or something to that effect.

1828 2018-04-21 13:32:03 It’s becoming an environment where it’s harder to consistently push shit onto people. It stands out like a sore thumb and causes friction. Those backing quality stocks don’t get into these battles.
1829 2018-04-21 13:31:21 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

1832 2018-04-21 13:28:13 Facts are facts no one can argue with it since I don't waste time doing this academic study on index return.

Ultimate truth is no one can become  wealthy by buying gold (it is an insurance) but stocks can make you wealthy.
1833 2018-04-21 13:26:13 I sometimes wonder if people saw my portfolio, would they say, "Dude, are you 40 or 60?" Lots of time-tested blue chips, nothing fancy. I am trying to focus more on growth stocks, so nobody will confuse me with the "Get off my lawn" Guy. #financialfuture #investing101

1835 2018-04-21 13:23:15 Bump stocks are useless to a real shooter. Most serious shooters would never use them as they are highly inaccurate. It's mainly a technique. You can get the same effect with a piece of memory foam. So, banning is useless.

1841 2018-04-21 13:17:51 That’s unfortunate William, investing in anything—whether it be cryptos or stocks — is nothing more than gambling if you’re using money you can’t afford to lose. We’ve always said to invest responsibly. Let us know if you have any additional questions, bud.

1881 2018-04-21 12:39:43 These last days/weeks have been amazing! We are up over 50k, but I noticed that had an unconscious target of over 10k a day after this streak which is far too exaggerated, so I decided to stop that , and aim for 3k a day if possible! #trading #stocks #money #bitcoin

1883 2018-04-21 12:36:54 The SCOTUS will overturn these semi-automatic bans, it is just a matter of time before the right case gets to the courts.

As to Massachusetts, even with the maximum punishment of life in prison, the people REFUSE to give up their bump stocks.
1884 2018-04-21 12:34:58 I smoke, eat, and drink stocks.Since i don't have figures will not take this any further for me stocks are always way better than gold(is an insurance not investment)

1888 2018-04-21 12:32:19 الزيادة الكبيره في الرسوم والمخالفات والغرامات عامل منفر  للاستثمار ، تعطي فكره سلبيه عن اقتصادنا ، الدوله بخير نحتاج الى تقييم ايجابي من الموظفين الكبار اصحاب اقتراحات الرسوم والغرامات والضرائب، يجب حماية الاقتصاد الوطني
1889 2018-04-21 12:31:32 What does 2008-2009 mean?  I trader would have more short position in a downtrend and a investor would have conviction and patience to hold long to his stocks.  2008-2009 events only impact immature who don't have any idea.

1891 2018-04-21 12:22:25 Yeah they are real and genuine followers but doesn’t mean they all trade the markets or are interested in the same trades as us. I follow a few traders overseas in the US and Canada that were recommended 2 me & I’ve not traded US stocks & only 1 stock Canada & that was $LGC. V
1892 2018-04-21 12:19:33 وهذا ما حصل بعد الحرب العالمية الثانية، حيث اجتمع الغرب واتفقوا على خطة مارشال، واليوم نشوف العائد، لو حسبت تكلفة مارشال والعائد، ستجد ان التكلفة تعادل صفر مقابل ما تم جنيه من فوائد وعوائد ليس فقط على المانيا، بل على اوروبا والغرب كله والعالم اجمع

1895 2018-04-21 12:16:56 صحيح هناك مشكلة، بس الحل يبتدي من القناعة بأن هناك مشكلة وقد تتطور الى ازمة كبرى، وبعده البلاد فيها من المقومات والموارد لمعالجة المشكلة، اذا تمت بشكل سليم، لان عوائدها كفيلة في استيعاب كلفتها، ومنها تتحقق فوائض مالية كبيرة لتأمين مستقبل الدولة
1896 2018-04-21 12:16:56 Is it me or is our coaching stocks the problem? Our cattle seem ok but skills, tactics & culture a gulf.

1899 2018-04-21 12:11:52 What is a big thing. Apply mind. If I pick wrong stocks then I make loss. So, why doner pay to @RahulGandhi  when his own party men doubt. Currently BJP is in power n going strong. So, people pay him. Also, those who like Modi, pay him.
1900 2018-04-21 12:11:22 It’s the slippery slope mentality of the @NRA that has kept reform from happening. To them banning bump stocks means the 2ns Amendment is being torn to spreads and they’ll come for the hunting rifles next. “The sky is falling!” message won’t work anymore. Reform will happen.
1901 2018-04-21 12:10:47 Help! Millennials Blackmailed My Blue Chip Stocks !!

أنا مع فكرة جمع الخسائر وشطبها بالجملة وإعادة الهيكلة الراديكالية وخفض رأس المال بما يتناسب مع واقع الشركات بعيداً عن المبالغات والتفاؤل الغير مبني على واقع

1905 2018-04-21 12:07:29 Agreed, bump stocks serve no (good) purpose.
1906 2018-04-21 12:06:36 Jay Marsden fires in a shot from the edge of the box but it’s straight at the keeper. Callum Stocks then shoots wide from a cross. ECU keeper handles the ball outside his area, no free kick given  #NPLWA

1915 2018-04-21 12:00:39 مارشال لو كان هناك فائض من الاموال ولكن الواقع ان هناك رفع كبير لأسعار الغرامات ومثلها للرسومات المختلفة ولاتنسى الضريبه المضافه ما يعني ان الدوله تزيد ايراداتها لتعويض الفاقد من النفط وماهو قائم اليوم يصبح امر واقع غدا وعلى طول
1916 2018-04-21 12:00:29 (2nd level? Also I could argue that anyone who thinks Bitcoin is an investment like stocks... Way beyond contrary into wishful...)

1917 2018-04-21 11:58:24 Get over it. No one is taking all your guns. Chill. So you won’t be able to buy an AR 15 or similar or bump stocks. Wah wah boo hoo cry baby over your guns. How weird and sad.

1929 2018-04-21 11:44:07 i am hearing that just today supermarket bosses have had a brainwave - the  next hot weekend lets get extra stocks of steaks, burgers, hot dogs ,hotdog rolls, burger rolls, beer , wine , salads ............................................
1930 2018-04-21 11:42:44 Naubos Stocks ko ng paganun ganun lang. wtf HAHAHA
1931 2018-04-21 11:41:36 Sorry Kim, 45 opened the door for the Gestapo to pull our guns from us when he pushed through legislation banning bump stocks.  Any "patriots", looking past this is clearly blinded by their idealogy.  It's as simple as that. Sheep being led to slaughter.
1932 2018-04-21 11:38:13 I just realize I have stocks in Starbucks  y’all employees need to stop fucking up y’all fucking with my money 
1933 2018-04-21 11:37:19 RCB is like a Retail investor in the IPL
Holding the stocks for many years when they were under performing
Sold the stocks, when they were about to surge in a big way
Similar to Reliance Ind
 Many sold the stock around Rs.1000/- in 2016
went up to Rs 1900
almost doubled in a year
1934 2018-04-21 11:36:30 Why Rahul Tripathi play at bottom

B. Stocks
H. Klaassen
K. Goutam
J. Archer
S. Gopal
J. Unadkat
D. Kulkarni
  This is good playing 11
1935 2018-04-21 11:36:20 Yes you will observe that all garment export stocks have doubled or tripled in 10 days. This is because cotton exports to china are expected to triple this year.  Worthy candidates many actually.
1936 2018-04-21 11:36:13 NRA: 16 year olds are to stupid to vote. 
Also NRA: 16 year olds should legally be allowed to carry AR-15s with bump stocks and all the ammo they can carry.
1937 2018-04-21 11:35:41 both stocks is in my do not invest list
1938 2018-04-21 11:34:44 most of the time i post stocks recommendations with chart

1942 2018-04-21 11:26:21 I’ll defend @allstarcharts here, it is historically accurate over numerous cycles that stocks rise as yield curve flattens. YC flattens during all econ expansions, stocks rise during econ expansions. He’s correct, totally pointless of him to tout a “duh” correlation, but correct
1943 2018-04-21 11:25:17 أولا لإنعاش السوق أرى..
* وجوب إدخال الأجانب في جميع الشركات بنسبة ٤٩% جذبا لرؤوس الأموال الأجنبية.
* الرقابة اللصيقة للشركات المساهمة ومنعها من المغامرة في أموال المساهمين وتجاوز أصواتهم..
* دمج سوق دبي بسوق أبوظبي
* منع إدراج الأسهم الخارجية الخاسرة.
* إدراج إعمار والخ. خارجيا
1944 2018-04-21 11:24:10 Very Generous. Still watching and learning from good investors like riddler.

Twitters an essential tool to me, as it removes the blinkers allowing a wide market view.  Easy to go 'all in' on a few stocks, but good risk managment demands we see and compare opportunity everywhere.
1945 2018-04-21 11:23:09 البنك ليس في أفضل حالاته هذه الأيام
ولكن
هناك أخبار إجابية بدأت في التداول
سمعت بعضها من ربيع يعمل في البنك
فنياً
لا قراءة للسهم لعدم وجود قاعدة بيانات بسبب حداثة الإدراج
ولكنه مرشح ليحصل على نسبة لا بأس بها من أحجام التداولات في حال إنتعاش الأسواق
السهم له شعبية جيدة
1946 2018-04-21 11:22:55 Condiments are tricky and vary a lot regardless of price.  The best ketchup I've tried is Hellmans but no-one stocks it! And don't get me started on brown sauce - Daddies isn't what it was and HP's far too sweet (common problem).
1947 2018-04-21 11:22:49 How many chances before one goes in? This time it’s Callum Stocks who puts an effort wide on the stretch. #NPLWA

1949 2018-04-21 11:21:09 الله يحيك
تاريخياً
السعر قريب من قاع إرتدادي سابق بين 0.30-0.28
ليس بالضرورة ملامسته 
قيعان الدعم تفعل ذاتها في بعض الأحيان بمجرد الإقتراب منها
اعتقد ان السهم على سعره الحالي وبعيداً عن اداء الشركة يستحق المغامرة عند هذا القاع والعلم عند الله
1950 2018-04-21 11:19:29 Well at least he doesn't purposefully  do things that drive the economy down just so his investing portfolios can purchase stocks had deflated costs. Your guy also hires qualifies people for infrastructure positions.

1957 2018-04-21 11:07:11 نعم لكن مجرد التفكير بصحتها خطئ تماما. كنا وصلنا لل٢٠ دولار و الان ٧٥ دولار و رغم ذلك يجب ان نصل لل٨٠ دولار!!! سنصل لها و عنده نسمع يجب ان نصل لل١٢٠ دولار. او انسحبت السيوله بسبب ترقية سوق اخرى ، او الحرب التجاريه و هكذا !

And we are not even talking about individual stocks.  Good luck with gold.

1970 2018-04-21 10:58:19 Would be great if it worked that way man but it don't. Those rich fucks don't create more jobs. They put their money in off shore accounts or buy more of their company stocks. Supply side economics is a myth

Gold Bonds (purchased in demat like stocks) come at a 2% discount with 2.5% dividend yeild and no capital gains tax aft 5 yrs. Stocks under LTCG. Its a must to have gold in ur Portfolio for long term i would say.

1995 2018-04-21 10:36:49 كله كلام جميل يا صديقي، لكن النتائج هي من تحكم، والنتائج معلومة لديك ، سواء في اسواقنا او الاسواق العالمية ، طبعا دون اغفال تفوق سوقنا سلبيا في هالنسبة لعدة أسباب هيكلية وخلافه
1996 2018-04-21 10:35:57 اكيد. انا فقط معترض على موضوع انو البعض ينتظر ٨٠ دولار للبرميل لبدا ارتفاع السوق بعد ان كنا نحلم بال٥٠ دولار. و اذا وصل ٨٠ دولار سنقول ننتظر ال١٠٠. و هكذا.
1997 2018-04-21 10:35:51 I'm sure there will be much more than 120 stocks so how did you collate this 120?
1998 2018-04-21 10:35:39 ربما جنون سفلي 
أحجام التداولات توحي بأن هناك ضعف عام في الإقبال
ننتظر إكتمال المرحلة الحالية
أو العودة كما تفضلت للجنون مرة أخرى ليتأجل معها دخول هذه الأسواق في مصاف الأسواق الإعتبارية لتبقى مجرد كازينو مفتوح 24 ساعة كما هي الآن
1999 2018-04-21 10:33:57 What about print and electronic and now even social media platforms which distribute and accumulate stocks by planting stories

2001 2018-04-21 10:33:23 لا يمكن بأي حال من الأحوال مقاربة الوعي الإستثماري بيننا وبين المستثمرين في الأسواق القيادية
ربما نعيش نحن اليوم مرحلة من النضج تجاوزتها تلك الاسواق قبل أكثر من نصف قرن
.
المقاربة هنا غير واقعية
2002 2018-04-21 10:33:02 الهوامير لن يدخلو السوق وهي نازل لازم يعطي اشاره دخول اولا
2003 2018-04-21 10:31:31 مع إختلافات بسيطة
درجة وعي المستثمر
والأدوات المتاحة له وحجم الشفافية التي يتمتع بها سوقه
تلاحظ التغيير في احاديث الناس
يتخوفون أكثر مما يبالغون
وهذا مؤشر جيد على إرتفاع درجة الوعي
وهذا ليس في صالح صانعي الوهم
ولكنه في صالح صناعة سوق محترمة
كبقية الأسواق

Fact -
Nifty was 1500 or 40$ & gold 300$/ounce 17 yrs ago. 
Today Gold 1300 (4x) & Nifty 160$ (4x) (10500) . Add Dividends & its 5x.

لو أن هذه الشريحة وبهذه الفكرة قرروا العودة للأسواق بمجرد صعود سعر برميل النفط سيتغير الحال بكل تأكيد!
2107 2018-04-21 08:52:44 @Ro_Patel good that you notice stock is trending down.   Monday good for stocks?  Not sure.  A lot of bad news out this past week DIA down
2108 2018-04-21 08:51:54 supporting ur decision, just couple doubts
1. R u going to give daily calls, if s r they for equity intraday/delivery r purely put/options.
2.R u going to focus on multibagger stocks or purely technical charts based analysis.
3. How r u gona run it, any platform planned for it?

2113 2018-04-21 08:47:07 Some of the stocks which the news channel suggest to buy will fall by day end and which they suggest to short will gain by end. It means some where investors are mis-guided by news channels

2116 2018-04-21 08:46:22 @smallcaseHQ 
Kindly let me know who selects the small case stocks,whether safe or not to invest.
2117 2018-04-21 08:44:31 Let me get it straight:

Stocks plummet for a while and we call it a "correction."

Stocks go up for a while and it's a "boom."

And people can like sell those stocks for real legal tender. And capitalism is somehow not a self-parody sham, but a respected economic model?
2118 2018-04-21 08:42:24 When I see people posting charts about how they're gonna make 20% I sigh. Smh go find some 100x's and degen out. this is crypto not stocks
2119 2018-04-21 08:42:19 نحن بحاجة إلى أمر أهم
تجارب ارابتك والسيكل والإكتتابات المبالغ فيها والإدراجات التي لم تحسن من وضع السوق كقيمة يجب أن تتوفر لها حلول 
.
وربما تكون الإندماجات أفضل الحلول اليوم
شركات قليلة وقوية تكمل بعضها 
أفضل من كثيرة وضعيفة وتنافس بعضها

2121 2018-04-21 08:39:30 صبحك بالخير بو عالية ،،
يعني نقطة معقدة شوي ومدخلاتها كثيرة ،
لكن في محاولة تبسيط للموضوع ، اذا الاعتماد على الدخل من النفط في أدنى مستوياته في دبي من جهة ومن جهة اخرى ارتفاع السعر يعني ارتفاع المصاريف للشركات والمواصلات اضافة لوقف تثبيت التسعيرة، بالتالي التوقع بهالشكل خاطيء
2122 2018-04-21 08:38:36 معاك حق يا خوي
لكن، لدينا مبدئ أقرب للقانون 
الحكومات لا تتدخل في الأسواق المالية بحكم أنها أسواق عرض وطلب
التدخل تنطيمي فقط
وربما تسويقي
ولكن لا توجد هناك آلية تسمح بتدخلها بشكل مباشر كداعم للسوق
ربما صانع بصناديق ومحافظ إستثمارية

وهذا مؤشر على ضعف الحركة الإيجابية الأخيرة

ولكنه عاد في آخر جلسة لإختبار ضلعها العلوي وأرتد عنه
نقطة إختبار الضلع العلوي كانت عند 3060

كسرها يعني العودة للقناة الهابطة وتأكيد على أن الإرتداد "الخروج من القناة" كان وهمياً

2168 2018-04-21 07:36:44 So lowest unemployment, record stocks, consumer confidence at 14 year high, businesses moving companies back to US, being energy dominant, etc., is a national nightmare? Get a clue.
2169 2018-04-21 07:35:01 #MomboAGM2018 Expect market volatility, but avoid portfolio volatility. Be prepared financially (cash reserves) and psychologically to buy more of the quality stocks in your portfolio when stock prices take a hit.
2170 2018-04-21 07:33:59 #MomboAGM2018 Avoid over diversification. Don’t own too many small positions or so many stocks that you become an index fund. This assures average performance and keeps you from owning only the very best opportunities.

2174 2018-04-21 07:31:49 Agreed, but it has not done that well in last 5 odd years. If we take $300 as base so it is roughly up 4x while Indian stocks up 10x...

2195 2018-04-21 06:58:16 @IamNjokiKelvinSome of them are a public provident fund, stocks, equity shares, mutual funds, bank fixed deposits, and much more. You can choose the most suitable investment option as per your needs, budget, and future plans.

2218 2018-04-21 06:24:17 When the 2nd Amendment was written, our founding fathers had one shooter guns. Imagine going to a war with a one shooter gun. Can you? lol I can't. Thankfully the company and creator of bump stocks hear their cry and have stopped making them. At least they get it.

2224 2018-04-21 06:17:32 Some of your best work yet imo.  It was nice to see you some shorter term charts mixed in and the stocks vs. bonds charts were awesome, seeing what a warning sign they were during the 2 crashes.  Thanks for another great video.

2240 2018-04-21 05:58:19 Crude prices are trading at their highest levels since December 2014.

1. Escalated geopolitical tensions;
2. Strong commitment by the oil cartel to "rebalance" markets;
3. Declining US stocks; and
4. Other supply outages.

2241 2018-04-21 05:52:05 I have a few simple rules for my investments after DD.

First: 
5-7 stocks max
Second:
In early
Third: 
If a holding has grown to a point beyond an amount that I would be prepared to invest as an initial investment, then it is time to trim

2242 2018-04-21 05:48:52 If inflation is at 4 percent and interest rates at 6-8 percent, then return expectation from equity should be 10-12-percent. For mutual funds, it should be slightly higher as they have the luxury of choosing stocks. - Aashish Somaiyaa

2292 2018-04-21 04:21:23 The US is considering tariffs because the ECB is printing money and buying stocks in the EU's major companies. In effect subsidizing these companies. The ECB has stated they will have to continue to do this until at least 2019. To prop up the EU economy. Which is near collapse.

2308 2018-04-21 03:57:27 Also, almost no one is saying full gun ban! They are saying close loopholes, do psychological evaluations to stop people who cannot use guns safely from having them, stop selling bump stocks, automatic and semi-automatic weapons. You are never going to stop murder,

2318 2018-04-21 03:40:16 Although they have helped rebalance stocks, the continuation of the cuts will simply keep the price fixed artificially as is, on the long term, it might back fire with lower demand as it goes above $70. Just my humble opinion. Russia is right on exit mechanisms.

2320 2018-04-21 03:38:54 Some people, yes. That is not mainstream. The mainstream just wants common sense restrictions: close the gunshow loophole, ban bump stocks, etc.

People arguing there will be a ban of all guns are just nutjobs who have succumbed to the fearmongering conspiracy theories.

2323 2018-04-21 03:33:03 See stocks that went up three times within one year and lost one third quickly. Screen such stocks. Dig deeper. You will find them easily. See who holds these stocks. The usual suspects will be there in every one of them.

2326 2018-04-21 03:32:21 I agree when we buy stocks, we should think as if we are buying the whole company.
2327 2018-04-21 03:31:16 Bump stocks are illegal. Domestic abusers cannot legally buy guns. Gun show loophole does not exist. If you mean private sales beetween citizens, then in order to do that you would have to have a full gun public gun registry that criminals would be able to see and make targets.

2336 2018-04-21 03:20:14 Leave it to the Tn House to make us laughing stocks again. They won't reup a bill that would protect an unborn child from drug use by the mother but approve a bill that would allow for a statue to be built to honor unborn children.

2345 2018-04-21 03:11:42 They taunt my dizzy ears . . . . they beat me violently over the head with their whip-stocks.
2346 2018-04-21 03:10:51 I was with her in spirit. I was the only person at my location so I walked to a nearby public library and picked up a voter guide so I can study the candidates. I want to know where each stands on assault weapons, bump stocks, & high-capacity magazines bans.

2350 2018-04-21 03:10:04 Ha ha libs are concerned about how the sausage is made as big problems are tackled when it's not their guy.

Flood conversation with unproven trivial accusations, while China is reducing tariffs on American cars, N. Korea stops nuclear tests & ballistic missiles, and stocks peak.
2351 2018-04-21 03:09:44 There are some men that I like to learn from, read and quote, and then there are those men who I would want in my company in the stocks. David Brainerd would have been one of them.
2352 2018-04-21 03:09:19 Don't underestimate the political power of the NRA! Their ties to the republicans are deep and powerfull... They won't budge an inch.. Bump stocks were a loophole not worth fighting for..
 Your best bet is mental health access related laws and bullying..
 Just my opinion ..
2353 2018-04-21 03:06:29 I wonder if @realDonaldTrump let’s his friends know before he sends out a negative tweet about a company so they can get ready to buy stocks??? #CorruptGOP

2361 2018-04-21 03:01:04 @realDonaldTrump 
Mr. President, 
I am very disappointed about the proposed ruling on bump fire stocks. Your taking the action of one crazy individual that clearly was insane and making thousands of law abiding citizens that legally bought one a felon overnight by your ruling.

2440 2018-04-21 01:18:48 If weed stocks start to turn back up, and I personally think they will big time, those warrants plays will give you nice gains. I recommend just selling them when you’re ready, versus exercising them ... but that’s just me! Your portfolio is better than any MJ ETF btw!

2458 2018-04-21 01:04:37 I think where we disagree is with the belief that anyone wants to take away everyone's guns. We want universal background checks, a ban on high capacity magazines, assault rifles and bump stocks. Assault rifles were banned from '94 to '04 and no other rights eroded.

2466 2018-04-21 00:59:38 What’s some good stocks to invest in 
2467 2018-04-21 00:59:21 This is perfect!! After the Las Vegas shooting it’s incomprehensible that NV isn’t leading on gun reform. Even just with bump stocks...it would have been a start but NOTHING!!
2468 2018-04-21 00:59:05 Mini-Stocks on track now.
2469 2018-04-21 00:58:38 @SenSanders I hope you know farmers are American workers too. The “farmers did well on trade deals” line. Bullshit! It costs $1.75 minimum to grow a bushel of corn. Market today $3.25 a bushel. Woohoo! What have you made on stocks? “Socialist”. #inners

2471 2018-04-21 00:56:21 Curious. Your views on the US stock market? Canadian pot stocks? Best emerging markets for short term investment (12 months.).
2472 2018-04-21 00:56:20 But it runs contrary to the Philippines being first in investment place-to-be, top tourist destination, stocks soaring, economy booming & popularity of PRRD is still high. No dead political enemies, only one in prison, no media person dead, vibrant politics, corruption curved etc

2476 2018-04-21 00:54:21 How many of these 500k to 3 million lives are saved by people who wouldn't pass a background check? How many are military rifles? How many lives have bump stocks saved?

2489 2018-04-21 00:36:03 Relatively speaking, even if stocks don't move the higher the 10-year goes the more expensive stocks appear ...
2490 2018-04-21 00:33:03 I'm curious as to how much money @realDonaldTrump 's friends have made shorting the stocks of companies he's "temporarily" tanked by tweeting negative things directed at them this year.
2491 2018-04-21 00:32:52 I bought $GLD puts Apr 27 & May 4, convinced US stocks will dip.
2492 2018-04-21 00:31:56 60% of money managers surveyed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch believe 2018 could be the peak year for stocks. #gold
2493 2018-04-21 00:31:30 These are the same people who bragged & took credit every time the stock market hit a new high... then were strangely silent when they realized stocks could also go *down* (including -2000 points in a couple of months).
2494 2018-04-21 00:31:18 So stocks and gold can go down together as well. 
The USD pain trade, as reported by Bloomberg, has already begun. The ECB is about to kick the € tightening can down the road.

2502 2018-04-21 00:18:19 No one's going to buy the stocks if you do the Toshiba deal. Plus, you don't even have possession of the stocks yet, and that's very important, because you being not able to transfer the possession of anything means you can't sell them. »To sell« implies 'transfer of possession'.

2507 2018-04-21 00:11:07 As to those who wonder why stocks sold off along with treasuries and higher yields, they might want to look back at the last 9 years as to how and why equities kept rallying.

2530 2018-04-20 23:54:27 In light of that, I kind of wonder if a bear market would be good for $nbev Why? Well usually all the consumer consumables perform better in that time. I looked at several beverage stocks the other day. They are all trending down. $mnst is a good example.

1. Don't get intimate with women. Get intimate with knowledge.
2. Once you get HIV, no matter how handsome you are, it's useless.
3. Wanna buy (stocks)? Just buy. 10-20 cents won't matter.
4. Wanna talk big? At least make your 1st $million first!
2582 2018-04-20 23:21:08 No. The stocks would be way more fun.

2585 2018-04-20 23:19:41 90% of stocks are traded by big institutions like Morgan Stanley and GS. At that poker table, the small investor will lose, so your only hope is to buy an ETF.
2586 2018-04-20 23:19:19 Market Close: MBS -27bps; DOW -201.95; NASDAQ -91.93; S&P 500 -22.99; 10yr Treasury 2.96%; Stocks close well into negative territory; MBS continued their fall below floor of support; and Yields break above their ceiling of resistance.
2587 2018-04-20 23:17:50 Love it...thanks for your insight as usual. Hope bears don’t drop the ball again. Would LOVE to buy stocks around 1800 SPX. Valuations are ridiculous again.
2588 2018-04-20 23:17:31 Caller: Many ppl have invested in medical #marijuana stocks. They’ve seen the benefit from that.

2590 2018-04-20 23:16:26 Do you realize this movement is about gun CONTROL, not taking away your guns? Provide a logical reasoning that semi automatic rifles, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks should be legal. Stricter background checks and less ease of buying ARE the solutions. It is that simple.
2591 2018-04-20 23:14:00 New York City officials have pledged to divest its pension funds from oil and gas stocks. Fossil fuel stocks were among the worst performing sectors last year. It’s time for New York state to do the responsible thing as well and begin to divest from corporate polluters.
2592 2018-04-20 23:10:31 I didn’t say that. But at this point, there are some individuals that basically act like wolves. Remember, prisons were considered humane. Previously, criminals were dealt with through blood money or public executions or the stocks (public rape).
2593 2018-04-20 23:10:31 2) my weakness has been forcing trades on stocks not ready, $fb, $snap, $amd.
2594 2018-04-20 23:07:59 @iamsrk Always when we go direct  buy we can see n buy when we order nearby supermarket he wants to get rid of his old stocks  so he will send those only Now we will think who is goin 2 exchange we end up taking those Ths is their trick always He send me yoghurt expiring same day
2595 2018-04-20 23:06:04 There’s always a bull market within a bear market. Weed def has the opportunity to be that sector. It’s new, everyone want it, and it’s breaking records every month. 

I also think if stocks are going down that just makes crypto more valuable. Can’t put all your eggs in one place
2596 2018-04-20 23:06:02 @Pudingtane where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
2597 2018-04-20 23:04:33 You’re hilarious. So he did that how? Did he buy all the stocks to get the market up?
2598 2018-04-20 23:03:44 1) Breaking my rule I am. Tweeting for transparency. I am down Q2 with trading account. The LT fund is doing fine, even though many holdings have been choppy. Learning every day in this market. My success has come from trading stocks I have been stalking for months, $fslr, $tsla
2599 2018-04-20 23:02:18 Bih i already got 14375 that i can fuck around with that i saved in 6 months not to mention stocks. I just been spending to much on my car
2600 2018-04-20 23:02:10 I'm glad to see my stocks going up 
2601 2018-04-20 23:02:05 A few months ago, I googled “What makes rich people rich” The answer was property, stocks, bonds and occupation. I found @RobinhoodApp , commission free trading, along with videos on @khanacademy to teach me all I need to know about Macroeconomics. Financial freedom, here I come
2602 2018-04-20 23:01:34 @fbi Got one for you...purchase of defense contractor stocks by congress...vitally important as conflict of interest is destroying our country.
2603 2018-04-20 22:59:45 Your freedoms are at no risk. And by "commonsense" I mean "commonsense" -- something you might even agree with: comprehensive background checks, age restrictions, no bump stocks, etc.
Don't get defensive. I don't have any power. I'm just a citizen like you. We can talk as equals.
2604 2018-04-20 22:59:25 Holding some.

2607 2018-04-20 22:57:20 Volume is the mother's milk of any bull market. I would be suspicious if it continues to be a no-show, especially since 1) it never showed up in S&P in Feb-Mar, only Naz, and 2) mkt is operating under a divergence as previously mentioned #stocks
2608 2018-04-20 22:56:38 Show some love for the alt coins Q. We call penny stocks OTC stocks not shit stocks. 
2609 2018-04-20 22:55:30 Can’t wait to see if the S&P can stay above the 200 day moving average next week. Crucial. #stocks #bear #oil #economics
2610 2018-04-20 22:54:46 Some companies planned changes BEFORE tax cuts, others have walked back their  announcements, but mostly companies are using the money to buy back their stocks, just like they said they would.  Don't buy the GOP spin,.
2611 2018-04-20 22:53:34 "Rich" celebrities or "stars" are like stock that a company or corporation owns in the stock market. "Rich" music artists are no exception. And once these "stocks" start losing value, then that affects Hollywood/music industry. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.

2613 2018-04-20 22:52:58 Huge week in the market for me!   I cleared out my first trade in my newly established trading account for something like 170 bucks with my hands tied behind my back (working, only putting in orders on break).  That’s a whopping $0.015 profit per share! #realizedgains #stocks

2615 2018-04-20 22:51:49 I have a total of 26 stocks  just because some are the same as yours doesn't mean I'm mirroring your purchases..it means I look...watch..listen.. research  wait and buy when the times right for me and my strategy
2616 2018-04-20 22:51:45 @bprafulkumar It appears in the last day or so Robinhood has removed the ability to sell calls or puts on most stocks and many etfs. This has left me with options I can’t spread anymore and bleeding $$$. Please Advise

2620 2018-04-20 22:50:25 I really want to get away from expensive stocks if i can. But for now i have tried everything and theres little i found useful except AMZN and TSLA and sometimes NVDA. I can get things done there with 1-2 contracts. With cheap stock we look at many more contracts, right?
2621 2018-04-20 22:49:27 That’s good to know. My local stocks only Australian printed cards so I shop their locally but the owners are strange. I’m going to ask them to stock them next time I go in.
2622 2018-04-20 22:48:49 I'm quite certain that if this proceeds to actual discovery that many skeletons will come out, more on one side than the other to be sure, but both sides nonetheless. I'm going to invest in popcorn stocks in anticipation.
2623 2018-04-20 22:47:07 We need to ban assault style weapons, ban high capacity magazines and silencers, ban bump stocks, allow universal background checks, eliminate gun reciprocity, increase mental health support, keep from domestic abusers, allow CDC research of gun violence. It’s just common sense.

2627 2018-04-20 22:43:36 Stocks put 2017 in the Washington Examiner, Paul Bedard reports that it's time to fix 8,000 bridges?

2629 2018-04-20 22:40:10 Not sure, but the recent consolidation in $xlf looks pretty similar to the same action in $xle right before it took off. I think that bodes well for stocks as a whole

2646 2018-04-20 22:20:27 Assault weapons don’t exist, fully automatic weapons are already banned. Banning high capacity magazines is ridiculous, a competent user can change magazines in a few seconds. And I agree with you that bump stocks should be a ATF item just like Suppressors
2647 2018-04-20 22:19:32 The so called assault rifle is nothing more than a standard semi automatic rifle with different types hand guards and stocks. Even the.....

2649 2018-04-20 22:15:34 Every investment made in personnel, IT, stocks,is based on risk profile of the asset & its projected ROI. The #1 factor in projecting ROI is past performance of the asset. Track record, resumes, prospectus, game tape is what matters. Attributes are absolutely meaningless

2662 2018-04-20 22:00:10 There is little evidence that tax breaks create jobs.  The companies have been buying their own stocks with the tax breaks.  Not to mention the ones that are going out of business
2663 2018-04-20 21:59:02 .@GovLarryHogan #mdga18 did their part to #ProtectMD and sent you 3 strong laws to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, ban bump stocks, and raise “red flags” before a tragedy with a gun happens. We know you support these measures, so please sign them.

2667 2018-04-20 21:54:24 Most growth-stock leaders are in good shape. The big difference between the Apr rally and the Feb-Mar rally is that the current move does not have the volume, perhaps due to caution amid earnings season #stocks

Not speculating what happened, just that someone gave OPCW Assad Sarin. @ClarkeMicah blog is BIG, but I havent found him mentioning it. Its at least significant.

2682 2018-04-20 21:46:11 Carl made a killing on the Iraq war. Perhaps he could enlighten us all on what stocks to buy during this current dust up with Russia.
2683 2018-04-20 21:45:51 We'll agree to disagree. I would have voted Micky Mouse over Hillary. He has has to deal with corrupt FBI, idiot Democrats, and traitor Republicans since starting. Yes, I hate the Omnibus. I couldn't care less about bump stocks. You can litterally make one at home.
2684 2018-04-20 21:44:07 But many could be avoided or reduced. To not do so is unconscionable. Ban semi-automatic assault rifles, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, and institute universal background checks. That's not asking too much.
2685 2018-04-20 21:43:48 Stocks are too high

2690 2018-04-20 21:41:48 "Buy stocks you know will be worth more in ten years."  Also "money management" is bogus.  You can't turn a negative ROI into a positive ROI with "money management" for if you could people would win at casinos with it.

2695 2018-04-20 21:38:38 Semiconductor stocks are in a world of pain. Sell-off is not done by any means. If your timeframe is over a few weeks action in the names is outright bearish IMO.  $SMH $SOXS $MU $NVDA $LRCX $AMAT and many more.
2696 2018-04-20 21:37:44 I have a friend who trusts the government, invests in coal stocks and thinks the world financial system is as strong as it's ever been.

He just had a birthday...... I bought him a horse brush.  #bitcoin
2697 2018-04-20 21:36:11 Allright. So this strategy only works with expensive stocks like AMZN and TSLA, since you collect hefty premium by selling both puts and calls. I usually sell TWO slightly OTM calls and TWO slightly OTM puts and then buy ONE call and ONE  put  15 to 17 away from the short strike.
2698 2018-04-20 21:36:07 I wonder how many House/Senate members own pot stocks? Boehner def does. 4/20 forever!

2753 2018-04-20 20:58:50 Sorry SCOTUS has already ruled that the 2nd Amendment is not absolute and states are allowed to restrict the types of weapons in civilians hands. The AR15 has been largely used in mass shootings, bump stocks should not been legal to begin with

2839 2018-04-20 20:05:02 I guess if I had to give it a number I'd give it a 60-40 Puff since killing Nana with a lead -> timeout is such a strong win condition. Even if Puff is at a big % deficit on equal stocks Puff can bring Popo to higher % before going for the timeout.

2841 2018-04-20 20:03:28 I wonder how many trading crypto/stocks/sportsbetting whatever even make a profit, 5-10%?
2842 2018-04-20 20:03:23 Well seeing that no one needs a AR 15 or bump stocks I get why the NRA would get blamed when they care more about money then the lives of children. Argue all you want, no one even asked for the smart Alec comment when we just said our pride rock shouldn’t be used for that
2843 2018-04-20 20:02:49 It's not confusing gun stocks are down because there are barely any regulations.
When there are #BanAssaultWeapons 
the stocks jump up. Which is y talking; is all that gets done, not passing it helps sell.

2872 2018-04-20 19:40:55 Stocks are still well into negative territory; MBS has further declined 25bps (from yesterday's close) heading toward second floor of support; and Yields continue to climb (up to 2.96%) and above strong ceiling of resistance.  Does it hold?
2873 2018-04-20 19:40:47 It’s very similar to the M-16, which IS, and when bump stocks are added, well... try again. My other issue with the AR-15 is its range and kinetic energy. It’s not the only one - the AR-15 is simply the one most are debating.

2967 2018-04-20 18:51:02 I do not trade stocks. I trade forex, futures, cryptos but occasionally will trade stocks.
2968 2018-04-20 18:50:51 3/Sadly, this group of stocks is systematically eliminated from most value investor's portfolios--notably passive indexes and the largest large cap value mutual funds.
2969 2018-04-20 18:50:42 2/Antiquated rules around share repurchases and intangible assets have created a subset of Veiled Value stocks worth $3.9 Trillion in total market value that have dramatically outperformed over the last 25 years, but most investors don't own them.
2970 2018-04-20 18:48:39 Golden boy is never wrong. 
I’m no longer holding long on stocks, I’ve lots trust in a few of my picks over recent events, and will be pulling once green and holding cash. 
A lot of moving plays going on imo.
2971 2018-04-20 18:48:01 Maybe we should donate to the anti-putin party in Russia. Turn about is fair play...except the nerve gas part later down the road...looking for  anti nerve has stocks online now!
2972 2018-04-20 18:47:52 To also be fair, not everyone in those companies will benefit, only the top ppl and shareholders, in the form of stocks. Rank and file employees are in the boat with the rest of us.

2978 2018-04-20 18:44:32 Hi Mr. Brandt, i just have a question: Did you manage to make more than 10 million dollars in these years by trading stocks?” Thanks
2979 2018-04-20 18:44:32 We could get comprehensive background checks that establish a minimum requirement for ALL states and territories, ban "bump stocks", 5-10 day wait periods, and possibly registration for ALL firearms. Those we agree; everything else stops the discussion.
2980 2018-04-20 18:44:21 how do you have plans on random intraday stocks that get overextended and you short them or is it more guidelines to similar crappy stocks that are up too much on the day and shorting into strength is just better odds?
2981 2018-04-20 18:43:56 1. They're literally USING their 1st Am. right--people against walkouts are quashing that. 2. NO ONE IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY THE 2nd amendment....... the 2d amendment doesn't say "all people shall have unfettered access to stockpiles of fast range guns and bump stocks."

2986 2018-04-20 18:41:59 the only approved patent owner for bump stocks stopped taking orders due to political pressure (Trump pushed for it actually) I know AR doesnt stand for automatic rifle & the key word I used was universal— & with many factors involved like domestic violence history & psych evals
2987 2018-04-20 18:41:47 .@GovLarryHogan #MDGA18 did their part to #ProtectMD and sent you 3 strong bills to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, ban bump stocks and raise “red flags” before a tragedy with a gun happens. We know you support these measures, please get ‘em signed! @MomsDemand
2988 2018-04-20 18:41:32 I share that doubt. I think it’s also fair to question whether the weapons caches in southern Algeria, in RM 3 & 6, that are often linked to Libyan stocks do in fact emanate from there, rather than captured/leaky Sahelian government stocks.
2989 2018-04-20 18:41:26 Even w/ all the protests and massacres, bump stocks still available for purchase. #unbelievable Let's get something done instead of keep just protesting! Let's do something! #doing Make these unable to buy!!!!!
2990 2018-04-20 18:40:53 We shouldn’t have admitted any. Do your job and pass legislation to ban assault weapons, large capacity clips and bump stocks

2996 2018-04-20 18:38:39 The worst thing you can do as an investor/trader is blindly ignore the possible pitfalls of any company. Emotional trading will destroy your trading account. Think of it as being on Tilt in poker. These stocks aren't your babies.
2997 2018-04-20 18:38:38 @charliekirk11 assault weapons and bump stocks are not “protected” under the second amendment. #BlueWave2018 democrats vs. NRA
2998 2018-04-20 18:38:37 Then I suggest you cash in your retirement account and any other stocks, bonds, or mutual funds you may own. Load your belongings into a mule driven cart and move to the hills. Modern life is far too complicated for you obviously.

3068 2018-04-20 17:44:01 Personally not sure of details re individual states. Bump stocks not guns but on gun with one continuous trigger pull can make fire as close to full auto as makes no difference so my opinion is their sale should be banned everywhere. Technicality allowing first place cost lives.

3084 2018-04-20 17:39:46 True but remember the cuts in regulations have been in effect too. All of these portend a better future and result in better financials. Remember Health Insurance stocks benefited immensely from passage of Obamacare. Not Health Care stocks Health Insurance

It was unfair in Itaewon they limited products to 1 item each customer but in NYC it was 10 each?

3090 2018-04-20 17:37:59 Completely agree. The popup store was such a fail, sold out in 3-4 days. Its hella weird that NYC has pretty steady stocks. Itaewon has been sold out since end Feb & only restarted for the hoodies. Japan physical stores are OOS but they still sell cushions online. -

3198 2018-04-20 16:49:08 Some states have banned but far from all.

3211 2018-04-20 16:44:55 Seems to me that Russian stocks tumbled when orangeman announced sanctions were coming last week, yet utterly recovered when he *changed his "mind"*...  I could be wrong, I might have dreamed it.. but I don't think so...
3212 2018-04-20 16:44:40 @Watching_Stocks Hey do you know of any info on $FUSZ being shorted? Thanks!
3213 2018-04-20 16:44:08 I think I'm going to start buying less clothes and more stocks.
3214 2018-04-20 16:43:42 48% of Americans do not own any stocks. Your "more than" is doing a lot rhetorical work.
3215 2018-04-20 16:43:36 ahhh good for bighit to put up stocks of love yourself tear on target and walmart while where i live they dont know what album of the year is
3216 2018-04-20 16:43:36 by the Geneva Covention. A law prohibiting detachable rifle stocks and banning over 30+1 round magazines is very effective. With 3-d printers and new polycarbonates and metal alloys...yeah we’re Gunna have a lot M-16s floating around soon (full automatic) and how that is prefer
3217 2018-04-20 16:43:26 @realvision I know you have to get listeners. But this year hasn’t been “treacherous” for stocks or asset valuations. See 2008-09.

3220 2018-04-20 16:42:33 I don't think that it is either, and didn't intend to imply it was (I'm out of crypto atm). I'm skeptical there are public stocks today that will grow the way a handful of ICOs will, but I do not think normies can pick those ICOs any better than the stocks.
3221 2018-04-20 16:41:49 Maybe you don't know that we have not exported more than we imported since 1975 at anything else is bullshit to do with anything.
The stock market Rises because the central bank has invested our future in it.

3227 2018-04-20 16:40:43 The stock market is struggling to end its consolidation move. I believe stocks are in bear market while #cryptocurrencies are slowly coming out of bear and moving into a bull market. If the correlation remains negative, we shall see major investors shifting to #cryptos.
3228 2018-04-20 16:40:32 Bump stocks have already been banned. And Congress will do something if they weren't paid off by NRA
3229 2018-04-20 16:40:18 When I see tweets like if you bought CSCO 18 years ago or it's been a lost decade for IBM I always think,do these people think that's the only stock any particular person owns and how poor could this person be to hold these stocks this long?They're one a beach or boat somewhere

3305 2018-04-20 16:11:08 The media starting with the narrative...3% not bad for stocks...the real number is 4%.  I actually agree but hard to put a number on it.  In any case, I think equity markets can stomach higher rates for the time being....watch as that narrative continues to develop.

This may actually be good because when the yield curve does invert and stocks plunge many people will turn to pot, alcohol, suicide, and other self destructive behavior. Very sad...

3330 2018-04-20 15:59:32 I thought my weed stocks would sky rocket on 4/20
3331 2018-04-20 15:58:24 Soybean stocks were last above 500 in 2006-07 marketing year, when they hit 574 million, or a 68-day supply. This year's projected 550 mln bu surplus is a 48-day supply, up from 26-days prev year and the 2nd largest of the past 2 decades if it verifies. #OATT
3332 2018-04-20 15:58:21 (3/4) Features. Grips/stocks/looks don’t make a gun any more deadly than it was before. Just research a California compliant AR-15. Still the same gun, without the “features.”
3333 2018-04-20 15:57:46 Not started anything stocks yet. The market never attracts me but, when the money comes... Of course
3334 2018-04-20 15:57:16 ahhh 4/20 can't wait to get high

growth on my weed stocks today
3335 2018-04-20 15:55:55 lajsj negative sides of capitalism. everyone's scared to run out of preorder stocks. it's the hunger games in it's capitalist form
3336 2018-04-20 15:55:17 Note to self. Buy marijuana stocks on 4/19 next year
3337 2018-04-20 15:54:23 That's what the gop said but that's not the way it's going The corporations are buying back their stocks and pocketing the money
3338 2018-04-20 15:53:22 I'm 100% for banning bump stocks and devices that automate fire.

For consistency, the gun ownership age should align to the voting age. 

The right to vote & the right to bear arms are rights of our citizens. You should be granted your citizenship rights at the same age.
3339 2018-04-20 15:53:17 Yes! My dad was a huge, blind trump supporter, spreading the Russian propaganda aaallllll over Facebook. Until his stocks and retirement accounts started to drop in value... now he’s pissed and hates Facebook and trumps “tax cut for the rich” all it takes is to be affected. 
3340 2018-04-20 15:52:39 @VerizonSupport I can sign into my BANK, transfer money, then sign into my BROKERAGE account, buy stocks easier than I can sign into my Verizon account and prove I am me to get something done.

3342 2018-04-20 15:51:51 Slightly Inflationary currencies may be better for long term contracts or day to day commerce. Let ETH replace USD while BTC replaces Gold and stocks as forms of savings.
3343 2018-04-20 15:51:09 Banks stocks are all up but they are up because of tax reform. No organic growth. This is what we saw during recession period; Inorganic growth from mergers and buybacks.
3344 2018-04-20 15:51:03 Devin and I talked about this on the drive to work this morning...weed stocks..not BA...although looking forward to seeing BA next week

3351 2018-04-20 15:49:48 In part due to the impact of corporate pensions... long rates rise = increased discount rate = decreased liabilities = improved funded status = glidepath calls for shift from stocks to bonds = demand for long-end

3360 2018-04-20 15:48:04 Yes - rich people pay taxes on all of that - poor people don’t - normally because they can’t afford to buy stocks and real estate.
3361 2018-04-20 15:47:54 The markets are functioning as expected with stocks falling and 10 yr rising. It would also indicate that the value of the dollar is stronger.  The rest is noise. The expectation is that the stock market is going to decline.

3365 2018-04-20 15:46:41 Well, no. If you were anything other than an indexer or closet indexer in Canada, you did much better than the index. In the U.S. in a rapidly rising market, yes index funds win, but you are owning a momentum fund of higher-risk stocks and most holders have no idea.

Top 10% of americans own an average of $969000
The next 40% own an average $132000
The bottom half own just under $52000

So yea the top 10% own the lion share of stocks in th US.

3389 2018-04-20 15:36:54 I don't think I called for an outright ban on guns. 

I think you can take some actions keep their deterrent capability, and yet lower the lethality for a mass murderer. Clip size, bump stocks, etc. A little less fun at the range, but that seems reasonable.
3390 2018-04-20 15:36:24 $SPY I'm not a die hard short. Open mind. It's still early and anything can happen. Holding some of what I believe to be (select) stocks.
3391 2018-04-20 15:35:58 Anyone who invested before 2007, (not millenials) just had to show up. Whether it was bonds stocks or even gold.
3392 2018-04-20 15:34:39 Sure roughly 52% of US adults own stock ehich is the lowest its been in 20 yrs. So those in the middle and lower class may own some stock but the majority of stocks are held by the richest 10%. Thats a fact.

3472 2018-04-20 15:01:55 IT stocks gained after good Q4 result from IT bellwether TCS. Gains were  also supported as the rupee weakened past the 66 level against the  dollar. A weak rupee boosts revenue of IT firms in rupee terms as the  sector derives a lion's share of revenue from exports.

3476 2018-04-20 15:00:21 Banning bump stocks would be ineffective as a measure to reduce gun violence. The LV shooting was an outlier. And anyone who wants to modify their semi to a burst mode weapon needs only a wooden dowel. 

Bump stocks aren't a major element in mass shootings.
3477 2018-04-20 15:00:17 Stocks lower again as rates putting pressure on valuations. Yields at 2.94% 10yr is a big move over the last week. Strong economy. Higher rates. This is actually good. We just don’t want rates moving too fast.

3573 2018-04-20 14:24:38 (4/4) Just something to think about in this "All tech, all the time" market. Stocks like $AMZN $AAPL $NFLX etc. dominate the indices and the public imagination. But the breathless #technology hype needs to be dialed down a bit. Especially with AMZN/NFLX trading at 253/266 P/Es

3633 2018-04-20 14:02:23 TIP OF THE DAY:  Keep track of certain names that routinely show up on stocks once they are up 15%.

3644 2018-04-20 13:59:03 $TLT still inside y'day range, but at lower end of it. FAANG type stocks love low rates for PE multiple expansion (legacy of the .Com crash).

3645 2018-04-20 13:58:56 Commonsense reform. First, let the public know what gun shops are selling a disproportionate amount of guns that end up being used in violent crimes.

4562 2018-04-20 02:10:23 U.S. stocks fell for the first time in four days as technology shares came under pressure from trade and earnings concerns.

    Treasuries hit the lowest since February amid a wave of selling across European sovereign debt and inflation.
4563 2018-04-20 02:09:59 cheongdam was only a pop store, they have closed back in Dec when BT21 was OOS. Airports do not have stock either. Itaewon has stocks for limited hoodies. But everything else is OOS in Korea & Japan as well I think. Only NYC & Hong Kong still has stock.
4564 2018-04-20 02:07:45 Which makes one ask the question why the Obama administration allowed these stocks to begin with? 
$$$$to the campaign coffers?
4565 2018-04-20 02:07:45 Going to start a hedge fund next year.  AKA: "MSP ALGO AI Trading Hedge Fund"  to help others that can't trade. Have to get license first. Getting lot's of request to trade for others.  #STOCKS #AI #StockMarket
4566 2018-04-20 02:07:38 I am not "not a fan", but I think the stock is way ahead of where it should be given its capital and lack of near-term cash flow beyond the clinic biz. I also don't like stocks with cult followings
4567 2018-04-20 02:07:23 Orkin just gave us more money, free stocks, more floating holidays and more due to the tax breaks! Thank you President Trump!!

4573 2018-04-20 02:02:28 Years ago I invested in some stocks and for the most part I forgot about it except when I get dividend payments. I have what I bought them for and just checked what they are worth today. WOW. If I need money I know where to go
4574 2018-04-20 01:59:28 Theresa May wants to ban bumbaclaat straws but feels NO WAY bombing BABIES. Oh wait, your man's company owns weapons stocks. Ching
4575 2018-04-20 01:59:06 MS-13 will probably bring in all kinds of bump stocks.  Thanks for protecting citizens...Not!  BTW you might want to read the Bill of Rights...oh wait, I forgot you don’t support or defend the Constitution!
4576 2018-04-20 01:59:06 @Sensay @levertis19 @Phenix1 I’m only dealing with penny stocks for now. only have $20k to invest currently. I stay away from foreign stocks
4577 2018-04-20 01:58:40 Banning ALL bump stocks is NOT going to solve problem though.  The weapons need to be banned to public & stricter background checks put in place 4 military using them.  Other issues like mental health should also be top priority. This is a multi issue problem.
4578 2018-04-20 01:58:20 Avoid such stocks where lots of circuits take place. Try and trade in liquid stocks which can rise slow & steady.
4579 2018-04-20 01:57:23 Eric - didn't realize you were such a true believer in dark matter!  do take a look at my blog on the income balance & the blog on cumulative flows.  Equity stocks basically balance, return differential on equity is big but comes from tax havens.  net debt basically covers CA
4580 2018-04-20 01:57:09 Just got our quarterly 401k statement. Lost 2k this time. First time in 10 years we have had a loss. Whether Obama is responsible for that I don't know but, Trump sure seems to want to take credit when stocks are climbing. Republicans always steal 401k.
4581 2018-04-20 01:56:43 For sometime now the Fed has been printing money and buying stocks to prop up the market and disguise the poor state of the economy. This can only go on for a limited time. Same with the ECB in Europe. Other main buyers have been buy backs by companies. This removes cash flow.

4605 2018-04-20 01:30:57 Was trying to fit that in. I also wanted to say just because the money invested is more doesn't mean better racing.  More often than not the Street Stocks put on a hell of a show.  At the top level they might say rubbin is racing, but the street stock guys will say "Hold my Beer"
4606 2018-04-20 01:30:54 The question is would you invest in stocks with 80% probability it will make one penny or more in the next 15 days or so?  In this trade you'll be risking $300 to make $150. Would u go for it?
4607 2018-04-20 01:29:10 Perhaps TA works with stocks other securities. No telling what the crypto crazies will do when they see a Bart Simpson head.
4608 2018-04-20 01:28:41 There is no question that this is the case, just like when dopey people read @barronsonline and Pro money managers make picks of stocks they currently hold to artificially inflate the price. They never divulge the new stocks they are buying, only what they are positioned in.
4609 2018-04-20 01:28:10 Yup xD But Id wager that higher than normal intelligence was the average for people trading stocks. Also, crypto is full off internet memes and saying FU to norms. Its a giant middle finger to traditional finance. .... Now i need to find dildocoin, its next to moon.
4610 2018-04-20 01:26:42 Indeed. I haven't unpacked the lab yet but as far as I can tell my chemical stocks made it through 4 months in storage alright. Ref the lack of anything having been eaten through by corrosive...stuff

4624 2018-04-20 01:11:15 Again, let me explain. If they are sitting on their money it’s because the tax laws makes it more profitable than investing it. If they put in stocks, then everyone’s 401K benefits. If it stays overseas again it’s the tax laws. I have never seen a Corporation not want to grow

4637 2018-04-20 00:57:39 How long has the fad been pouring money into stocks, which have no intrinsic value and are ultimately just a game of hot potato to see who's left with stocks when the company goes bankrupt or a game of musical chairs for acquisition, and you don't know which one you're playing?
4638 2018-04-20 00:57:26 I wonder if horse head stocks have gone up? Can I invest? On the Dow?
4639 2018-04-20 00:57:00 Obama had more and did nothing . Trump at least wants to ban bump stocks and strengthen security at schools. It is a shame that this has nothing to do with guns, but everything to do with lack of taught values.
4640 2018-04-20 00:56:55 The #NRA is now threatening republican lawmakers in Florida who voted to raise the min. age for all gun purchases & ban bump stocks. The NRA says they won't receive "A grades" anymore & is discouraging people from voting for them in the future. 
Fuck off @NRA. #FuckTheNRA
4641 2018-04-20 00:56:09 Let's go back to when they used to drag people to the town square, put them in the stocks, and throw rotten food at their heads. These "congressmen" deserve no less.

4648 2018-04-20 00:49:31 Ok so your saying fully automatic weapons are legal? Because “literally all false.” And bump stocks don’t make a semi-auto fire as if it’s fully auto. Please don’t walk in a room say false and walk out. Back up your statement with some facts please.
4649 2018-04-20 00:49:23 if someone were to quickly glance at crypto twitter they'd probably assume that we're a community of furries who trade stocks
4650 2018-04-20 00:48:06 Trump admin decided to (rightly, and after building up the US's wealth) defend the US from China (and the world's) unfair trade practices with the US, the stock market seemingly had no limit, despite tariffs talks, the stocks are staying between 24,000-25,000, which is a record.
4651 2018-04-20 00:45:22 Same with sigma and API.. Their out of stocks or when they send you stock from another warehouse it takes an extra day. Why sigma and API concern me more?
