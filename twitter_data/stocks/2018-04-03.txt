56 2018-04-03 23:41:38 Its not unethical. They are trying to make returns. After the GFC, money flooded “hedged” funds and totally crowded out the game. Its the investors fault. You get fired as HFM for both underperformance AND style drift. There are so few stocks left. Its just a bad business
57 2018-04-03 23:40:51 Been around gun owners all my life. Never heard of bump stocks.  Sounds like something a criminal would know about.

Matt Phillips 
62 2018-04-03 23:39:18 They didn't even ban gun channels, they specifically went after channels that show shit like illegal mods and bump stocks.
63 2018-04-03 23:38:48 We sold our stocks a couple months ago. Actually considering taking money out of 401k because we lost so much in 2008.
64 2018-04-03 23:37:00 @realDonaldTrump Hey Con man where is your bragging now. Stocks tumbled on Monday, the first day of the second quarter. It was their worst start to April since 1929.  C'mon lets hear you say how great you are one more time.
65 2018-04-03 23:36:04 Looks like you're smoking all the  pot stocks too I see
66 2018-04-03 23:35:54 I know, my family has guns and I have shot semi-automatic handguns before. You're making fair points. How about bump-stocks? Do you believe they should be banned?

69 2018-04-03 23:33:17 So which is worse, Fed members saying that stocks are over-priced or a president attacking publicly traded companies??  Taken together, investors can expect large volatility and hair cuts.  Need I say more?
70 2018-04-03 23:32:50 While less powerful guns is a long shot, the banning of bump stocks is also valuable.
71 2018-04-03 23:32:02 Is that why Russian Green Party called her a traitor? Is this why Jill Stein has fossil fuel stocks?
72 2018-04-03 23:31:56 I hope Jeff Bezos sues trump!!!Abuse of power!!! Using the office of the presidency to attack an American company!!!Amazon’s stocks fell yesterday due to trump bashing the company!!! Enough of this bullshit!!
73 2018-04-03 23:31:22 We want more than thoughts & prayers. We want laws that protect us. Age must be at least 21. No bump-stocks. No automatic weapons. Nationwide standardized security checks.

80 2018-04-03 23:27:45 Not true (for me atleast). I am willing to understand and accept that even though I generally dislike someone and their beliefs, they can still do good things. Trump was trying to ban bump stocks, and I have to give him credit for that.

88 2018-04-03 23:22:17 My god, are u suggesting the PO is in cahoots with Amazon? And is this a personal beef with Amazon (you know, like with the NFL) or do you have actual concerns? A sitting pres should not make statements that cause stocks to drop.
89 2018-04-03 23:21:49 Your thoughts and prayers are useless. You took more money from the NRA than anyone and now you’re their puppet. Just banning bump stocks is a joke.
90 2018-04-03 23:20:21 Everyone has an opinion. I heard multiple Boeing employees saying they don't understand why Boeing share kept on going up. 9 in 10 ppl I know working for amazon have already or want to change jobs. None stopped both stocks flying high.

100 2018-04-03 23:16:58 Oh i think that stock owners are of all political affiliations.  I have found that Democrats are more likely to not buy certain stocks if they are against company principles...like tobacco industry and guns.  Whereas Repubes are all about what will make $$ regardless of harm.

It’s not abt Bernie. Bernie’s irrelevant- ever since he sulked in VA election& Ds won anyway. A feat we’ve replicated in 40 elect now.
Amazon is an impt co in Econ. Tanking its stocks for shits &grins is appalling.
BS spouts off on it?
Yawn.
103 2018-04-03 23:15:43 Nice! So many shareholders hold stocks paying a widow’s mite in dividend year after year, while institutional investors and the gluttonous live high off the hog. Good to see ordinary Joe Blow getting a decent return on his investment too now! Big up Missa Chin!

106 2018-04-03 23:14:56 Its funny how you 2A nuts always equate banning the sale of assault rifles and bump stocks with, they are coming to take ALL our guns
107 2018-04-03 23:14:29 Along with the RV info from Dick Algire - if yiu already have good amt of BTC/LTC then it may be a good time to hold off any future and have cash on hand. A meltdown in stocks and bonds surely will cause cryptos to drop (initially).

112 2018-04-03 23:11:56 Speaking for myself only, I don’t hate the second amendment. I only want weapons of war, automatic weapons and bump stocks that turn semi-automatic weapons into war weapons, banned. I don’t expect you to understand this because you love Doturd
113 2018-04-03 23:10:44 smh, they really evolved. I wish i was conscious enough to put stocks in them back then. Flexing with the netflix on the Wii.
114 2018-04-03 23:09:41 People still Twitter mob, or drag or whatever and I hate it. It’s the digital version of putting someone in the stocks in the town square and jeering & throwing rotting fruit at them. We haven’t become more “civilized” at all. We’ve just built the arena anew every few decades.
115 2018-04-03 23:08:38 Make it harder to get guns, less powerful guns and no guns for the mentally ill. Also no bump stocks or suppressors.
116 2018-04-03 23:08:26 James Beard said of broth and stocks: "They're all the same thing." And that's how I was raised.

118 2018-04-03 23:07:13 You sold a few months??? And people are listening to you? And you invested in cyber currencies?? And you don’t think Trump is a great president?  You’re a real genius, aren’t you?  Why would you admit you sold your stocks? How much more wrong could you be?
119 2018-04-03 23:07:00 As always, thanks PBD!
120 2018-04-03 23:06:53 Great, hopefully when the stock market crash I will be able to get some good stocks on the cheap. Also it going to be fun to watch Trumps farming rural base suffer from China's retaliation.
121 2018-04-03 23:06:35 Bump stocks. Gotta ban those bump stocks.
122 2018-04-03 23:06:34 it might be popular but it's useless for allocation purposes.  Run a sim where you are long stocks when it is under 100% and in t-bills when it is over.  It's not pretty.  @MishGEA
123 2018-04-03 23:05:09 @realDonaldTrump  Can you keep your mouth shut about the private sector? I would expect lawsuits out of this. Do you care about the stocks I have in Amazon sir? No you don't the base is going to leave you at this rate.
124 2018-04-03 23:03:28 @realDonaldTrump all my stocks that were up during Obama as our President is all down the drain because of your ass.  Between you attacking companies like Amazon and your tariff war with China its gone down even more! Can't wait for the day your ass is in jail #MuellerIsComing
125 2018-04-03 23:03:28 Tax cuts for Americans mean more money to spend & buy things not stock. People don't run out & buy stocks after getting tax cuts.. Some buy cars, clothes, homes, food, vacations etc...
126 2018-04-03 23:03:25 1/2
Its a question of privacy in schools. The 2nd amendment never specifies modifications to guns like bump stocks or an age, so its silly to make clear backpacks instead of getting to the root of the problem. Also, your definition of infringement is wrong.
127 2018-04-03 23:03:17 And how much you wanna bet Trump's cronies sold Amazon stock with advance knowledge that Trump was going on the warpath.
Just like he did with steel, aluminum and auto stocks when he announced tariffs.
128 2018-04-03 23:02:16 I'd just say that veggie stocks can be destined for drinking but cannot be "bone" broths.

136 2018-04-03 22:57:44 Not trying to be a pain, honestly, but when people say “females” they often mean it to dehumanise woman. Females is an adjective. Women is the noun form. Little things do help ^_^
137 2018-04-03 22:57:17 "I think" there is a lot of good opportunities in pot stocks!

138 2018-04-03 22:57:00 wow i’m really starting to invest in stocks? is this what adult life is all about?
139 2018-04-03 22:56:45 @BillyBuckbee @CTGOP #TheMoreYouKnow... there was a reason police chiefs are FOR banning bump stocks in CT #dotherightthing #Enough #CTLeg
140 2018-04-03 22:56:40 I would prefer a gap down open to 26 so we can flush all the algo's forever and load 1500 stocks there and sell it back to algo's at 46  $csco
141 2018-04-03 22:56:34 @jimcramer  3 stocks. 3 non related sectors. 1 @ 52 w low. 1 @ 52 week high and 1 in the middle . ALL 3 went down by 4% . fundamentals, homework and all the talking head BS means nothing. Corrupt Wall st fleecing algos do.

143 2018-04-03 22:55:51 He's banning bump fire stocks, you know the ones Obama allowed in...
144 2018-04-03 22:54:28 He didnt tell the NRA to fuck themselves but I think he is honestly trying to get congress to go to univ backgrd checks and ban bump stocks.
More of an effortvthsn previous admins.
He is a realist. He knows you will never disarm Americans
145 2018-04-03 22:53:15 They actually do support some measures of gun control. They support expanded background checks, they supported banning machine guns outright rather than just requiring a difficult registration process, and they also support banning bump stocks.

147 2018-04-03 22:50:25 les estoy contando como es la pràctica habitual, si lee una sola vez, seguramente vean facturados "agua x6", no "pack x1" (no se usa el metodo de embalaje como unid. de venta) Y si bien no hace falta un doctorado en IT, hay razones de administracion de stocks que justifican eso.
148 2018-04-03 22:49:48 WH Advisors: You see Donald, the market is lead by about 5-10 stocks, so if you're trashing them online, you won't get to tweet about the stock market going up.

Trump: Yeah, yeah I get it, believe me. Hand me my phone.

Trump: [types] F*CK AMAZON [clicks] Send Tweet.

149 2018-04-03 22:49:44 the YouTube campus is the only Google campus that stocks the fridges with every flavor of La Croix. this was obviously about La Croix.
150 2018-04-03 22:49:44 ha @jimcramer is talking abt "dont own stocks" on his show right now. I many times refer to stocks, etfs, and various funds as stocks, and forget which is which :)
151 2018-04-03 22:48:54 I own two stocks - AND I’M IN!
152 2018-04-03 22:48:45 Sup bro? @kurteichenwald heard you're having a bad day. Wondering if it was as bad as the day you sold your kids' stocks predicting a bad @realDonaldTrump economy? Or as bad as the day you showed the Twitterverse your porn? Asking for a friend.

153 2018-04-03 22:48:44 Hello Frank, how's the stocks this afternoon?
154 2018-04-03 22:47:45 Amazon is one ofnthe most widely held stocks in mutual funds. I bet more people were hurt by the dotard than they realize. SAD!!
155 2018-04-03 22:47:44 This is a freakin’ lie. Companies have not done anything Ryan says. These companies are laying people off and buying back their stocks. Contrary to Ryan’s deceit.
156 2018-04-03 22:47:31 @CNBC for the past 18 months: “Sell GE, Buy $FAANG, Tax Reform, blah blah”  Today the crypto stocks lead the micro caps, and no one has the@balls to mention it!  @BKBrianKelly
157 2018-04-03 22:47:06 Both GOP and Dems join together on banning bump stocks; "They're not gun nuts. They're not crazies. ... They're doctors. They're lawyers. ... They're people we know on the PTA. ... They're soccer moms,'' says Rep. Dubitsky. "They're the NRA. ... They're good people.''
158 2018-04-03 22:46:40 @SteveDeaceShow 
There r only 2 things that affect the stock market, when investors sell stocks & buy stocks, thats it! There r rumers, news, economic policies, new tech & many more things that make investors buy/sell stocks, but the buying & selling moves the market. Thats it!
159 2018-04-03 22:46:03 Not official tally but the bill banning bump stocks has made it out of committee on a bipartisan vote. Some Republicans that voted yes: Srinivasan, Rebimbas, O’Neill, Candelora, Labriola. Still several committee members who haven’t voted but as of now 26 yes votes and 4 no votes.
160 2018-04-03 22:45:54 But wasn’t he short the FANG stocks???
161 2018-04-03 22:45:38 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your depression
162 2018-04-03 22:45:38 Yes. All indexes remain s/t bearish. There were a truck load of black-fail candles on the daily charts for many individual stocks. The late day ramp was just a nonsense story on $AMZN
163 2018-04-03 22:45:12 Niceeeee! Good day for bit coin stocks
164 2018-04-03 22:44:12 So the lobbyist you rented the apartment from (at way below market price) got insider information on a pipeline??? So is that the same as insider information on stocks and finances. Isn't that illegal???
165 2018-04-03 22:43:53 Hey, fuck face, you realize you are effecting the owned shares and 401k plans of 100s of thousands of American workers right?  I've had to cancel a home repair because your attacks have tanked my stocks to the point they won't cover the cost.  So this is #MAGA?
166 2018-04-03 22:43:03 Can Amazon and others begin a class action lawsuit against the Trump admin for defamation b/c of his personal vendetta? He's caused their stocks to fall and lies about their business. Amazon must have lawyers on staff.
167 2018-04-03 22:41:31 i guess it's like long war/gun/oil/etc stocks
168 2018-04-03 22:40:26 As soon as i heard you talking about this on my drive home i knew exactly who it was. He stocks shelves in a grocery store by my house. Nice guy.
169 2018-04-03 22:40:21 I cannot believe the moron sends a tweet about Amazon and then Amazon’s stocks fall. Does he have that much power? And FYI, Amazon has HELPED the USPS with all the postage paid for packages. AND Amazon packages aren’t cheaper to ship than other packages. Idiots!
170 2018-04-03 22:40:04 Prediction: when Trump is done tanking the market, expect him or his cronies to buy deflated stocks, if they have not already sold short.
171 2018-04-03 22:37:55 the worst part is appcoins/"utility" tokens pretty much never have any connection to the potential success of the underlying protocol. so they arent even "netflix stocks", theyre just a worse money (as compared to bitcoin).
172 2018-04-03 22:37:49 The stocks will be fine soon. parcel delivery account for 1/3 of last year’s revenue. Without amazon, the USPS will be history. So sad. You are going to destroy the Postal Service because Bezos won’t kiss your ass. What a joke.
173 2018-04-03 22:36:53 Kudos to @pauldoyle4ct @WilliamTongCT and @SteveStafstrom on shepherding the bill to ban bump stocks through the Judiciary Committee. Bi-partisan yes, but wouldn't have happened without Democratic leadership.
174 2018-04-03 22:36:36 Breaking: Judiciary committee votes to ban bump stocks on bipartisan basis; committee meeting continues
175 2018-04-03 22:36:35 I do not usually adhere to the bull case for #gold for exogenous reasons. The escalating trade war is an exception to the rule. Trump is going to push #gold thru its U$1,350 - U$1,360/oz resistance, it is time to be long quality precious metals stocks.

Bring it on.
176 2018-04-03 22:36:32 because economy in USA is unsettled, trump blasts amazon and look at what happen to their stocks, whats going to happen is people wont invest in usa because people dont trust usa economy.  still avg out? because many nations are planning to leave usa dollar
177 2018-04-03 22:36:10 Is that tweet kept secure in your clipboard for easy, day-to-day access? Are your stocks of thoughts and prayers not running a little low?
178 2018-04-03 22:35:47 I’m a trader In and out for profit. I don’t invest until there is a major catastrophe in a sector producing bargains. Buy good dividend paying stocks like COP & MSFT when they are on sale You don’t need to chase a market Be patient & wait for a major event that hands u bargains
179 2018-04-03 22:35:30 Be careful man! I wish you luck. I'm going to replace my bank with #Ethos . Later this year, in addition to their universal wallet, they will issue a debit card. You also hold your own private keys! You will also be able to invest in traditional stocks.
180 2018-04-03 22:35:15 Didn’t the beef industry sue Oprah for causing beef stocks to drop?
181 2018-04-03 22:34:44 Spotify stocks soar 25%
YouTube are apparently shooting up too
182 2018-04-03 22:34:13 Then you Must be happy with what has happened since the Election. There has been Real Growth in STOCKS that earn money for that 401K. Dips in the Market happen as your 401K sells after making money and then buys back in at the lower price to increase again as market goes back up.
183 2018-04-03 22:32:13 Buy stocks in eyebleach, it's about to rise
184 2018-04-03 22:31:30 but stocks are cheap.. right Warren?
185 2018-04-03 22:30:02 The market does not know if you are long or short and could not care less. #forex #stocks
186 2018-04-03 22:29:49 its almost as bad with the regular trading markets, stocks and the like, except why is there still 401ks at all if it is that bad as talked abt with same extremely dark overtones constantly by too many folks. scary.
187 2018-04-03 22:29:11 @manukumarjain Attention sir !

192 2018-04-03 22:24:56 @JeffBezos I sincerely hope you sue Trump for his false and libelous statements that precipitated the devaluation of your company’s stocks. As President he cannot be allowed to behave this way.
193 2018-04-03 22:23:40 #stocks  Don't be swayed by the market sages and shills telling us "today we closed above 24,000".  Big deal! So when are we going to close above 27,000 where we were in early February? Obama's Bull Market is over and Trump killed it.
194 2018-04-03 22:23:40 A vicious vendetta. No thought of ripple effect this will have on stocks, retirement plans, workers, etc. — he just wants to hurt Bezos. This isn’t presidential, these are the actions of a petty mean-spirited vindictive man who is unfit to lead.
195 2018-04-03 22:23:08 Mr Stock Market behaving irrationally? Thinking about quitting and selling everything? STOP! Ask yourself "Would I buy this stock at this price?" if yes, buy or hold. Don't follow the herd, do your research #StockMarket #stocks #advice
196 2018-04-03 22:22:27 Donald Trump's approval rating rising could be bad for stocks. He has had a tough time being loved by supporters and investors at the same time.

198 2018-04-03 22:20:57 When TechCrunch deleted that tweet about how much Spotify stocks are when they went public today for trading, it hit me even more that the rich/wealthy will continue to prosper. Until you find yourself in those private circles, forget it.
199 2018-04-03 22:20:14 You can trade whatever you want.  If people wanna trade, more power to them.  They can trade any damned thing they want but should probably realize it's no different than trading penny stocks or walking into a casino.
200 2018-04-03 22:20:12 Real headline: Dollar Store stocks plummet.
201 2018-04-03 22:19:58 It's a lot easier to save money when you invest in e.g. stocks. Once it's out of your bank account and allocated your psychology changes. It feels like it's already been spent. Selling into cash back into your bank account will take some time too preventing impulsive behaviour.
202 2018-04-03 22:19:56 My brother is married to a Russian - she says her people think UK has completely lost plot.

203 2018-04-03 22:19:43 Tech stocks are crashing because Facebook and Google are scrubbing history and censoring truth. They are also likely targets for getting impaled with the Sherman Anti-Trust act as well.

207 2018-04-03 22:17:45 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
208 2018-04-03 22:17:15 @jimcramer is it an okay strategy as a young investor without a lot of money to invest solely in stocks that pay dividends? Or should I be looking for stocks where there is a likely chance of buying and selling for a profit?
209 2018-04-03 22:17:12 Republicans on the CT Judiciary Committee while filibustering the common sense ban on bump stocks conveniently forget that the State of CT has spent over $50 million on school security. #BanBumpStocks #GunReform
210 2018-04-03 22:16:44 $4 billion in bonuses for individuals. How much did large corporations and the wealthy get $100 billion ???   Much of that money is going for stock  buy backs which do not benefit most people that don’t own stocks.

213 2018-04-03 22:15:09 I guess banning those bumps stocks really solved the issue good work America
214 2018-04-03 22:14:45 There are 14 mass shootings under #Obama 8 of them school shootings.  He too gave his thoughts and prayers and did not do anything else. Oh wait, under him bump stocks were made legal.
215 2018-04-03 22:13:32 When the market goes down people start to panic. But the fact of the matter is that you WANT to buy shares when they are on sale. It doesn't feel good to see stocks fall but chill out.
216 2018-04-03 22:13:24 What did I learn from all-day teacher meetings? The same thing I learn every time...I really need to invest in PowerPoint stocks. 
217 2018-04-03 22:12:54 Can't believe that a shooter was at YouTube HQ. She may be dead and the only fatality, but this only solidifies the need for common sense gun reform: stricter background checks, ban of bump stocks and military grade weaponry and a registry. We can't keep allowing this to happen.
218 2018-04-03 22:12:29 Market WrapUp: stocks close higher rebounding from previous decline. AXL sold earning 2% and SCHW closed higher and still open.

221 2018-04-03 22:11:28 just gotta watch that candle close IMO
222 2018-04-03 22:10:40 Short interest on the FANG stocks is low. All this article does is look at short interest and calculate how much shorts have made. This is not analysis. It is a useless fact turned into an article
223 2018-04-03 22:10:36 Something exceptionally satisfying about new highs in cannabis stocks 
224 2018-04-03 22:10:31 I noticed.
225 2018-04-03 22:10:31 I’m very surprised the market hasn’t crashed before now!

Yes, when it happens, it will go in larger blocks of stocks until hitting bottom
226 2018-04-03 22:10:22 I've said that too on my pod. Probably with McVay but I duno if he's at a Carson Wentz, Jimmy G level. But QB stocks go up and down all the time

230 2018-04-03 22:09:02 Stocks went up today Peter, please dont fool people
231 2018-04-03 22:08:33 I think you're fussing over what is essentially noise but that's just my opinion. My point yesterday was stocks down hard and bonds did not see a flight to quality. that was it.
232 2018-04-03 22:08:17 Spotify closed at $149.01, and it's still losing cash. Crazy exuberance or rewarding innovation? #stocks

241 2018-04-03 22:02:16 . The bump stock bill was a good bill-it would have banned bump stocks. They killed that bill not even allowing the Vegas shooting survivors speak.
242 2018-04-03 22:01:37 Leave us alone. If you invest in a shitty project, that’s your own fault. Can almost lose money as easy in traditional stocks as well. Tesla is up 10% today, that’s more than bitcoin has swung in the past few days
243 2018-04-03 22:01:33 FUCK YOUR THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. Illegalize assault weapons and bump stocks. Lengthen waiting periods. Close the damn gun show loophole. DO THE RIGHT THING, NOW.

248 2018-04-03 22:00:02 I don't think about financial success as the measurement of my success. trade forex stocks
249 2018-04-03 21:58:50 I did consider the hatchet attachment but you know here in Kansas it’s pretty flat and not a lot of trees so I thought I could get more use out of the dual loading bump clips and the triple recoilless Stocks.
250 2018-04-03 21:58:28 This is Crypto, Not stocks.
251 2018-04-03 21:58:17 Certainly isn't one of the stocks that Barrons put in their cannabis stock cover article this weekend - as some of those have valuations higher than projected annual Canadian cannabis sales. Just a little hint to help us on our way?

254 2018-04-03 21:55:14 Instead of thoughts and prayers, how about legislation restricting assault rifles and bump stocks? How about psychological tests and licensing for gun owners, with renewals on both testing and licensing at set intervals?
255 2018-04-03 21:54:33 Lax gun regulation in the USA. Availability of military style semi automatic assault weapons of war to US civilians that can be modified with bumps stocks and other accessories to make them fully automatic. Inconsistent/ineffective background check system, to name a few...
256 2018-04-03 21:54:20 Cannabis stocks in major correction so doesn't bode well for an IPO
257 2018-04-03 21:53:02 My position is always been reasonable restrictions. Don't take away everyone's guns. But people don't need bump stocks to hunt animals.
258 2018-04-03 21:52:55 ban assault rifles & bump stocks to civilians Now!!!!!!

260 2018-04-03 21:51:59 Risk On as U. S. stocks rise to session highs, bond yields gain on talk President Trump’s policies won’t shake global trade and economic growth.
261 2018-04-03 21:50:42 Gone the way of bump stocks?
262 2018-04-03 21:50:40 I couldn't read the Barron's article - there was a paywall. It will be interesting to see what happens going forward. The pot stocks are overvalued. But there will also be increasing interest as legalization draws nearer.
263 2018-04-03 21:50:26 Stocks you own bonds you loan
264 2018-04-03 21:49:56 but you just said banning machine gun production has resulted in them being rare and unable to be used in crimes. why does that logic not apply to any other guns? and bump stocks were literally just used in vegas so i dont think that's a good route for you
265 2018-04-03 21:47:49 trump & his minion Ihcon in a more resent case of security fraud with the steel tariffs as 32 million in steel stocks sold the day before announcement of the tariffs ; investors should be nerves&concerned that trump’s treasury & he may have this market rigged for the big pay off!

267 2018-04-03 21:46:39 - Don't allow known violently mentally ill people to get gun licenses
- More stringent background checks
- Raise the legal gun age to 21
- Ban assault weapons and bump stocks
None of these are "ban guns" (and I don't support the latter two)
268 2018-04-03 21:45:30 I didnt say just mass shootings. I said gun violence. You are cherry picking what I'm saying. And yes initially the NRA said ok to banning bump stocks within a week of that they said they will not support any legislation banning bumpstocks.
269 2018-04-03 21:45:10 Jesus also said, "But when you've really got to mow 'em down, go for semiautomatics with bump stocks.

274 2018-04-03 21:42:01 Having in mind Intel’s Market Capitalization, such a decrease in Intel’s stock price after the news was out is nothing at all. Also, the stock’s “low” was reached before the news was even out(this is to prove my point).
Only lost and uneducated investors sell their stocks now.

277 2018-04-03 21:41:02 Untrue statements plummet stocks of a company is securities fraud. This president has committed securities fraud right in front of our face...no one seems shocked, maybe ‘cause we are desensitized to his lies? Somebody contact Mueller to add this to the list of Trump deceptions.
278 2018-04-03 21:40:46 After much hesitancy stocks recovered almost all of yesterday’s drop with a late day rally. The Dow gained 390, the S&P 32 and the Nasdaq 71. Breadth reflected the strong close: 2.8 and 4.5 to 1. The bond behaved and the VIX retreated about 2 full points.

284 2018-04-03 21:35:55 You do realize that corporations bought back their stocks and that was the initial rise in stocks. China tariffs are targeting Trump's base, hence the market is falling. Tariffs will initiate a depression.

312 2018-04-03 21:28:53 Discussion on bill that would ban bump stocks began about 5 p.m. in judiciary committee. “This bill is capitalizing on a recent very emotional situation and it finds it’s origin in politics and not policy,” Rep. Rob Sampson, a Republican, said. He's the first to speak so far.

318 2018-04-03 21:26:55 Remember, it wouldn't have been necessary if Obama hadn't legalized the bump stocks in the first place.  Why were you silent when that happened?

327 2018-04-03 21:24:17 If I could time travel I wouldn’t really do much of anything other than buy stocks. I’m boring

329 2018-04-03 21:22:53 Oh hell, he probably did it on purpose and let his rich buddies know to dump their stocks in certain companies in advance. He'd never do this unless it would make him a killing in the market personally.
330 2018-04-03 21:22:15 Will pray for Andre Gray and end up with a second tier Finnish reserve with a calf strain
331 2018-04-03 21:21:41 We need to look at our portfolios. Folks with 401’s really need to pay attention to this stock manipulator. 
I would like to know if Trumpf sold off any of his stocks while in office. He’d never take a hit, and he’s been busy damaging specific companies.
332 2018-04-03 21:21:05 Isn't it securities fraud when you knowingly lie about a company and it lowers their stocks?  Just another thing to throw you in jail for - it's a growing list.
333 2018-04-03 21:21:00 I have to say the gun show loophole should be closed. Trump said he would ban the bump stocks. And I truly pray for the people involved in this shooting.
334 2018-04-03 21:20:21 .@Rep80 just compared bump stocks to knitting needles and sugary drinks on the house floor. At a time when we should be doing everything we can to prevent further gun violence, Republicans will do or say anything to cater to the gun lobby.

339 2018-04-03 21:16:05 That's a start, but I'm sure Gove & friends will ensure there's a nice long period during which their rich friends can sell off their stocks. I don't trust that a thing any of them say is for the good of anyone or anything but themselves at this point.
340 2018-04-03 21:15:54 Doctors are reporting a spike in whiplash occurrences. Many of the sufferers apparently have a job in finance #ausbiz #XJO #investing #equities #stocks
341 2018-04-03 21:15:44 And I'd agree with you when it comes to fully automatic weapons or devices like bump stocks (used in LV) that accelerate the rate of fire of semi automatics.  But "assault weapon" bans based on a gun's appearance rather than it's actual capability simply doesn't make any sense.
342 2018-04-03 21:15:17 We should be able to live in a country without fear of being gunned down. Common sense should prevail, no fly list = no guns, no silencers or bump stocks to reduce the carnage, background checks for everyone. This should be basic by now.

352 2018-04-03 21:12:00 I hope he gets sued by the ppl that lost money in stocks & Amazon sues him. He did it bc he hates Bezos. Probably bc he's a better businessman than DT. The P.O. is making more $ than they otherwise would. The P.O. has less normal mail due to tech. UPS would do same bc of volume.
353 2018-04-03 21:11:53 No it doesn't point to a source. Iran publicly said last year they had made this weapon. Israel and North Korea refuse to even declare their stocks. Uzbekistan where also making this chemical.

391 2018-04-03 20:56:19 My grandfather said when he used to buy stocks in the 1960s, he would buy maybe $2500 of stock and the commission was $75 in 1960s dollars!!!!  Which would be like $300 today!!!

396 2018-04-03 20:54:02 Farmers are in a bad way, Spring is crazy late this year, there is no grass in the fields - silage/hay stocks are dwindling. But Spring will come & the grass will grow we all just have to hold out for a few more weeks. #ThinkofFarmers for the next few weeks as we hope for Spring.

398 2018-04-03 20:53:06 Whelp like raising the age to own a gun, banning bump stocks, assault rifles, and extended magazines . It looks like something is being done. People still have access to weapons of all forms tho. Carry on.
399 2018-04-03 20:52:54 For all of you with cannabis stocks today....

I feel your pain too.
400 2018-04-03 20:52:42 Well 100 round and bump stocks are a start.  
12 rounds still seems high for a rifle tbh. 
Semi auto are still fast enough. 30 in 10-12 seconds. 
Baby steps mate, limit Mags and ban bumps. Gotta start somewhere.
401 2018-04-03 20:51:43 I’m sorry but your sensible laws wouldn’t save lives. The fbi doing their job would’ve saved lives. Also the worst shooting in history, Vegas, your sensible laws wouldn’t have prevented. And the NRA is in favor of banning bump stocks.
402 2018-04-03 20:51:25 Article 1 section 10 last sentence:
403 2018-04-03 20:50:52 We don't know if he's profiting from the statements by shorting stocks. Amazon is far from the first company he's berated.
404 2018-04-03 20:49:53 I would agree with this until YouTube announced they would ban promotion of firearms and assembly of weapons / bump stocks. I just hope people are ok

408 2018-04-03 20:47:24 Trump is manipulating stocks since his election, please...
409 2018-04-03 20:46:57 via video demonstration using an AR15 u can unload 40+ bullets in less than 2 mins add a bump stock u can unload the same in less than 30 secs. what chance has any armed officer have to get their in time to stop the carnage - 0 chance. That’s why ban assault, ARs, bump stocks
410 2018-04-03 20:46:15 A delphinium, a orange blossom, and a edelweiss went into a bar. The bartender says why the stocks?
411 2018-04-03 20:46:09 It’s never fun when stocks fall, but they’ve treated investors very kindly over the last few years. The S&P 500 has been positive 91% of the time year-over-year going back to 2013
412 2018-04-03 20:45:10 I sold all my weeds and crypto stocks in Jan, and I'm still down 8% this year. Can't imagine what it would have been like If I had held
413 2018-04-03 20:44:32 kinda sorta should have seen the correction in pot stocks coming, always looked like early Nov were realistic levels,
414 2018-04-03 20:44:29 Compounds don't come with a birth certificate, but at the same time if you know the compound, which country has the materials to make it, which country has made it/has stocks/feedstock/apparatus etc., and that country is Russia, the circumstancial evidence is strong
415 2018-04-03 20:43:47 It's all about PR.  The moment you admit that PD has stocks of novichok then you cast a degree of uncertainty as to the source of the agent used on the Skripals.

429 2018-04-03 20:36:04 I am long term also but prefer for the set up to confirm for me.  There is a great trend awaiting us.  The fundamentals are really coming together.  I can't say the same for the stocks atm.  Some time next 3 to 6 months I hope.  Maximum end of year.  Good Luck also.

431 2018-04-03 20:34:43 Indiva - NDVA.v - lots of red for weed stocks today , but at least NDVA saw green.  I don't own the stock but I own those cheap warrants NDVA.wt
432 2018-04-03 20:34:20 Sounds like brainard says valuations are high on stocks, risks to financial system are moderate, and may be in favor of increasing capital buffer for banks. The latter is contractionary (lower for ED fronts), the former two points are expansionary (dovish) higher for ED backs.
433 2018-04-03 20:33:58 Manipulating stocks is illegal. Trump continues to think he is above the law. He continues to attack anyone that goes against him and his racist actions are intolerable. He takes no blame for anything he has screwed up but takes credit for President Obamas accomplishments. Loser!
434 2018-04-03 20:32:29 Why does he feel the need to attack companies without all the info. It’s directly hurting people as stocks drop. I guess if I were a billionaire I wouldn’t care either
435 2018-04-03 20:32:18 Hi Colin, On sale immediately after the game - whatever stocks remain will be available by mail order from Sunday - details to follow.
436 2018-04-03 20:31:17 After watching markets the last 3 months I favor income stocks with good liquidity. Unfortunately, not enough of those to choose from. Pfds were easy to maneuver in / out in 2016, H1 of 2017. Not any more. Fed hikes making this a very tough year to make money.
437 2018-04-03 20:30:48 You don't know how first amendment rights in regards to being the president. Effectively lobbying against a business entity to adversely affect their stocks isn't a first amendment issue. It's securities fraud, it's 100% illegal. Has nothing to do with free speech.
438 2018-04-03 20:30:18 yea, to me I look at them more like stocks. You want to get in while the price is low so your investment looks shrewd. If you're late to the party you're paying at the peak, instead of the before it gets hot.
439 2018-04-03 20:30:15 So if you stocked 100 south coast ballan wrasse, from 500 miles or so south of your farms, in one cage, how long do they survive? Are we talking years? Months? Do you have independent scientific data that shows the impact of your industry on wild wrasse stocks?
Just interested...

Why do they get rid of bump stocks? Because it "increases" your rate of fire.
I got no qualms with not having autos all around, but I can't have a semi auto?

453 2018-04-03 20:21:37 US stocks rally, rest of world lower: US +1.3%; Europe -.5%. My sympathies to short-term traders trying to outguess the market. Since it's responding to Trump tweets, trade-war signals or political news; it's pure chance. Long-term investors have it easy - just stay the coutse.
454 2018-04-03 20:21:08 A little bit ago I watched a YouTube video that was uploaded on 2-21-18 and the brought up bump stocks and how Trump considered putting restrictions or some shit like that on them. Personally I do t find them dangerous. They destroy accuracy because of how they work.
455 2018-04-03 20:21:04 I am pro regulation for crypto’s.

523 2018-04-03 19:57:45 Dues to sugarcane farmers is estimated at ₹16,000 crore. Surplus sugar production of 4.5 million tonnes have led to a crash in ex-mill sugar prices to ₹30 per kg, which is lower than production costs by ₹5-6 per kg. @shyamsek, @porinju - do you see values in sugar stocks?

629 2018-04-03 19:19:09 Well they’re not really illegal, they’re just highly regulated. You have to go through the ATF and can only purchase ones made before(I think)1985. And IF you’re approved,your name goes into a registry so they can keep track of you and the weapon. So regulating bump stocks? Sure.

682 2018-04-03 19:00:36 The man who NEVER met a stock market he liked. The problem with perma bears is that you can't run a viable portfolio based on generational events. AND, stocks have a permanent tailwind of increasing population and economic growth over the very long-term.

692 2018-04-03 18:56:16 debatable whether FI took the FED as less hawkish (a "dovish" annoucement) or if it was a reaction to stocks turning over that put this little bounce into fixed income

again i thought what was up for debate/decision in Mar was 3 vs 4 hikes and 3 was the decision: jun, sep, dec
693 2018-04-03 18:55:34 Why doesn’t Amazon sue Trump for defamation or are they afraid it’ll bring their stocks down even more? Trump needs his ass kick all the way to prison. Please hurry Mueller!
694 2018-04-03 18:55:04 Must be pretty confident to have core positions in any sector or stocks. Imho, esp. when dealing with jr stocks, whom are usually 1 nr away from stardom or 1 nr away from failure so to speak, nothing should realistically be treated like core positions. Just be diversified enough

696 2018-04-03 18:54:40 $100 per year...  8% rate of return...

Well, the only way that would happen if you're having them invest in stocks...  and they'll be docked that 8% up front via brokerage costs.

782 2018-04-03 18:28:36 As a citizen and a Twitter follower I call for Trump to be banned from Twitter for knowingly spreading lies about Amazon. This has cost stocks to fall. This is also Security Fraud which is a crime. Do the right thing Twitter. Please re-tweet and spread this message.
783 2018-04-03 18:27:04 Music stocks are the new airline stocks. $SPOT down to $155.00. No way that company ever returns $30 billion to shareholders.
784 2018-04-03 18:26:54 The issue I nearly always have with the #active vs #passive #investing debate is same as with other subjects usually treated as black & white, the benefits of shades of grey in between are overlooked e.g. some governed multi-asset portfolios are both low cost & actively managed.
785 2018-04-03 18:26:46 Heard him speak at the CFA annual dinner in late 2015. Only took pre-written "questions" from a moderator. He kept talking about some "T-junction" that markets were coming towards and that stocks were rich. Large caps +30% from his warning.
786 2018-04-03 18:26:42 I'm up 67.9%! They are in the infancy stages. There have been "blockchain" related stocks with similar share structures that ran 2000-3000% on fluff news. There's no fluff here. They're just getting started! All depends on what your goals were. $NBDR

794 2018-04-03 18:22:24 This is bull$hit. Every time Trump tweets something that causes stocks to fall, he's stealing from our retirement accounts. This should be against the law.

797 2018-04-03 18:20:52 I think if PD didn't have those stocks, the govt, would put a helluva lot of pressure on them to tell us, don't you?
798 2018-04-03 18:20:16 Trump is clearly using the office of the president to manipulate stocks. He needs to be charged with a securities crime!!!!! #TrumpCrimeFamily He is ruining this economy!!!

807 2018-04-03 18:15:59 High Yield is just not a good place to be.  The market shrinks due to defaults.  Better to put half in stocks and half in safe bonds,  More tax efficient.  There is no place for High yield in any longer term investor's portfolio

811 2018-04-03 18:13:34 That is true. Part of my initial reaction is me being pretty anti-capitalist right now. I feel like there are better ways to accomplish the spirit of the idea without the creepy ownership ideas that stocks can imply.
812 2018-04-03 18:13:12 One of the guys mentioned this afternoon, on the closed Facebook page, that Andrew Deeney did his work, and that he never even saw Darren Reynolds once despite him signing the SR.  

“Shambolic performance by so called Professional people”.  

This goes to Strand Capital, too..
813 2018-04-03 18:12:48 Wait for girls to start hitting on you for your tampon stash. (Get pads too). My robotics team (yes, y’all have one too) stocks the girls bathrooms at our competition and the boys have to go out and buy them.  It’s awesome to see how much they learn doing that!
814 2018-04-03 18:12:31 Securities fraud. Making knowingly false statements about a company causing it to lose value so that it affects owners/investors. That includes ppl with stocks in Amazon
815 2018-04-03 18:12:21 The emphasis is on controls.  Maybe they are good enough, maybe they aren't.  But given that PD refuses to confirm or deny that they have novichok stocks, it raises the possibility of a local source of novichok that made it out the door.
816 2018-04-03 18:12:01 Your ignorant.  Markets every day change prices based on future expectations.  Regardless of party.  It was smart and rationale to think what will Trump do then make bets in stocks good or bad depending on what u think.  They thought he would be good for stocks and prices went up
817 2018-04-03 18:08:59 They should also file a complaint with FINRA which is responsible for investigating trading in public company stocks that may be questionable or illegal. I hope one of the many securities plaintiff firms will bring a class action suit against #Trump as a test case.

819 2018-04-03 18:07:25 "Aitkenhead would not comment on whether the laboratory had developed or kept stocks of novichok, but dismissed the suggestion from Russia that the agent used to poison the Skripals could have come from Porton Down."

Assuming you don't own ind stocks but possible 401K-those are impacted.  Question:  are you rich?   If not you must be stupid
822 2018-04-03 18:06:57 Conversation about stocks and money >>>
823 2018-04-03 18:06:48 Hypothetically speaking, if it were found that the UK secretly had stocks of Soviet-made missiles, it would occur to me to inquire as to why. By the way, jingoism is useful for domestic politics. That’s a fact.
824 2018-04-03 18:06:23 She was talking about, and this is specific, bump stocks. She STILL said nothing about a full gun ban. That is what *you* decided to interpret. She could have meant anything from assault weapon ban to better BG checks, mental checks, etc.

Do you plan on shooting any color shots (or experiment with it)? Would be interesting to see shots on Fuji FP-100c or Portra 800/400 - I feel like those two stocks would work really well aesthetically possibly, or any really expired color film. 
839 2018-04-03 18:00:27 I can like Trump the president but despise him as a man. He has done nothing to help me so why do I need to support him. My stocks have plummeted because of him. My taxes went up because of him. Nothing he has done has benefitted me.

906 2018-04-03 17:38:36 While Amazon is not a “tech company” in conventional sense, it has one of the largest business Cloud operations; it obviously uses technology in its operations..it is quite usual for tech companies to be growth stocks and not pay dividends.

911 2018-04-03 17:37:44 Or perhaps I find it ridiculous that in a protest about excessive fish stocks having to be dumped overboard, a chap dumps fish overboard; or there is the idea that I simply don’t like plaques, or hats, or umbrellas or gardens.
912 2018-04-03 17:37:17 @RepRooney millions of people have 401k's that are being affected by Trump and his hammering that are affecting stocks! And you support that? We will NOT forget at mid-terms that you support a President who is killing us financially!

920 2018-04-03 17:34:25 Since the GOP Tax Scam was signed: 
1.4 trillion added to deficit
$170.8 billion in corporate stock buybacks 
The top 10%  owned 84% of all stocks in 2016, 
The richest 1% owned 40% of stocks.

921 2018-04-03 17:34:15 There must be a law against Trump using his position to affect Amazon stocks.  Let’s find it. Trump doesn’t care that his narcissism could affect 500,000 Amazon employees.

928 2018-04-03 17:30:12 Yeah I don't know the answer. I'm not a fan of numb stocks either. I don't know how you would regulate lockboxes either but it is a good idea. In hunter safety they always teach people to lock their ammunition and guns separate.

932 2018-04-03 17:28:38 The UK intelligence services and military have already done their job, IMHO, James. Which was to place Russia in the frame of THEIR making. It was impossible to identify Novichok as quickly as the UK managed without possessing Synthesized stocks of the nerve agent themselves.
933 2018-04-03 17:28:36 @netflix @amazon @Google #facebook are just a few of the giants whose stocks have plummeted. Have they figured out yet that their liberal bias isn't working for them? They should consult @therealroseanne to learn how NOT to denigrate 50% (probably more) of their customers.

935 2018-04-03 17:27:21 So we are considering consulting with an attorney about the option of filing a lawsuit against you for your false statements about Amazon causing their stocks to drop! Do you know who you're hurting the most? Not Bezos!

946 2018-04-03 17:23:21 They have the largest subscribers base though. Barring no disruptive move from Apple, there is stability. Plus the valuation is based entirely on market forces, & not what Spotify itself set. Also currently tech stocks are selling off, so $169.5 may even be lower than its value.

961 2018-04-03 17:18:55 Trump-no major legislation other than tax cuts, wide use of executive orders to remove regulations..multiple scandals, including Carl Icahn “guessing” right about steel tariffs and making millions selling off his stocks-Scandal? Market destabilizing in 2018

970 2018-04-03 17:15:23 exactly what I thought when @amazon #stocks fell after @realDonaldTrump @USPS #FakeNews #Tweets. I guess it depends on how much they want to pay their lawyers who I bet are better and smarter than Trumps who can't even get him to #stfu
971 2018-04-03 17:15:17 That’s what I thought because then he could short sell stocks. Etc ..

979 2018-04-03 17:11:44 Tech stocks are becoming a disappointment. Spotify's IPO is uneasy. Look to consumer non-cyclicals, they are on sale now. Hold them until the storm passes.
980 2018-04-03 17:11:12 None of the above, it will tank just like every other big announcement does for stocks\crypto.
981 2018-04-03 17:10:55 Mrs. Duckworth, when Trump opens his and attacks companies their stocks drop people who have invested money are losing there retirement. While him, his friends are making millions in profits at our expense. Congress needs to protect it's people

990 2018-04-03 17:08:25 People think stocks fall suddenly. But unloading hundreds of thousands of shares among the heavy sellers takes time. The market gives warnings. Once again, get away from a daily chart if you want to become a pro.

With Federal delays in the new law, and a new gov't looking likely in Ontario, I see major headwinds going forward for weed stocks
998 2018-04-03 17:05:49 I heard he lost heavily....

At height of the last #uranium Bull Market there were over 500 #U3O8 related companies to choose from, so gains were muted to some degree as #investors had so many U #stocks to spread money around. Today there are only around 50 left to invest in, so do the math.

1006 2018-04-03 17:03:10 Feel sorry for Americans losing millions in retirement accounts, mutual funds and stocks. What about college and charity endowments? What about jobs/money that would be lost if Amazon takes H2 to Canada. Canada is offering a lot.

1019 2018-04-03 16:57:24 Right. There was a couple that was able to retire at the age of 37 or 38 just a few years ago. They did it by instead of buying a house they saved up all of the money that they would've used for their dream home and invested it in stocks, retirement, bonds etc.

1033 2018-04-03 16:54:14 Before the stock market crashed, around 3 million people owned stocks. That's about one out of every 100 Americans. Most of those people RELIED on those stocks for their money. Some didn't have jobs. Then all of a sudden, those 3 million people lost their money AND their minds.

1056 2018-04-03 16:48:31 Time to short Volatility

If you have long term longs in your portfolio consider selling 1m 3-5% OTM calls to monetize volatility (and lower your overall portfolio volatility while you’re at it by reducing your delta). 

Premiums are in the 2-5% range for many blue chip stocks.

1093 2018-04-03 16:37:05 I think we can agree there. I don't see the need for bump stocks, I am fine with longer waiting periods, deeper background checks, and raising the age requirements. all good stuff, but remember, criminals won't abide and mentally ill peeps will do what they will do.

1146 2018-04-03 16:23:56 Low volatility is not bearish - it is a sign of bullish conviction.  The last calendar year that is most similar to 2017 was 1995 (very low volatility) - stocks went up big time over the next four years.  Volatility was high at both 2000 and 2007 peaks.

1153 2018-04-03 16:23:02 Hey @amazon you guys going to fight back against @POTUS @WhiteHouse anytime soon, you do know you have more supporters than he does right, plus I’m tired of my stocks going down because CEO’s are afraid of this bankruptcy clown... enough is enough. Call him out finally
1154 2018-04-03 16:22:35 Could have been a millionaire if only my 1980s stocks of hair spray and Blockbuster Video paid off.

1159 2018-04-03 16:21:57 I’m gone get into stocks and bonds 
1160 2018-04-03 16:21:34 It isn't. It's stupidity all around. It's just more culture war nonsense. It's just that some are preserving liberty and others are curtailing it. It will end in cosmetic stupidity being passed and folks to prep for the next go around. Invest in firearms stocks in a year.
1161 2018-04-03 16:21:33 $FUSZ    All the huge-mover stocks ...from Syntex to Polaroid to Whittaker, way back ...to CSCO + AAPL + MSFT, NFLX + GOOG...have had their shakeouts , shake- the -trees days ...be calm + FOCUS on the success to date ...and the road ahead + RORY CUTAIA = his vision !!!
1162 2018-04-03 16:21:16 You asked for female shooters. But it’s obvious that you have an agenda because you mentioned bump stocks which have never been used in school shootings.
1163 2018-04-03 16:21:02 Didn't Trump start the trade war with China? How has Amazon caused Wall Street stocks to fall. Amazon's stock did fall based on Trump's comments, but that is one company and not the entire market.

A small minority of rich people own about 80% of all stocks.

The barrier for entry into that game is very high; insurmountable by most people that are barely getting by.

How about @amazon pays their fair share in taxes first.
1167 2018-04-03 16:19:27 Always good to take a day off after some killer trades.

In this case, I'm letting stocks bounce for awhile before I go short again.

1173 2018-04-03 16:18:21 As far as gun laws go, why has London passed New York in murders? It isn’t because of guns. I agree with no bump stocks. I agree with stiffer background checks. I agree with no large capacity magazines. Beyond that I can’t blame a tool for the decisions of the user.

1181 2018-04-03 16:16:25 "Amazon is the fourth most valuable company in America and one of the most widely held stocks, so its slump has dragged the broader stock market down. The Nasdaq has fallen 2% since Trump vs. Amazon became a thing again.  So much for Trump the stock market champion."
1182 2018-04-03 16:16:10 #Future Forecast
Market turmoil may be linked to such volatility leading to a further  boost in High Frequency Trading and within institutions. This is also  linked to the incredible and broad retreat in stocks from the “fat  finger” trading in future contracts.

1189 2018-04-03 16:13:48 In #trading self-discipline should be viewed as self-love. Tell yourself “I love you too much to let you chase, impulse trade, revenge trade, oversize positions, be greedy, give in to FOMO, hesitate or not study.” Show yourself some love & stay disciplined! #girlswhotrade #stocks

1192 2018-04-03 16:13:06 Dow Jones Industrial Average rising more than 100 points, helped by a recovery in the battered technology and consumer discretionary stocks.
Amazon and Tesla, the top drags on Monday, rose, with the Dow and the S&P opening above their 200-day moving averages.

1199 2018-04-03 16:10:29 It's also obvious that assault rifles must be banned, along with bump stocks and high capacity magazines. Background checks must also be required for all sales of firearms.
1200 2018-04-03 16:10:27 Even Trump can't derail today's rally that tells you selling of stocks is washed out and a bottom is reinforced made yesterday as I had thought

1223 2018-04-03 16:03:28 Speaking of conflicting interests: Is Donald involved in shorting Amazon stocks? Is this all just some financial chicanery to help out some friends/family aiming to make quick money at the expense of Amazon? Is that how Kushner & Trump hope to pay off their enormous debts?
1224 2018-04-03 16:02:57 Ok, back to guns. What’s “on the table” for legislation? Ban guns; ban automatic weapons; ban bump stocks; repeal or modify 2nd Amend; raise purchase age; extend background checks; restrict purchase (mental health, domestic abuse, etc.); safer bldgs.; arm SRO's and teachers, etc.
1225 2018-04-03 16:02:45 I’m sure Trump supporters have no idea that Trump is purposely blowing up their 401Ks. Trump is trying to crash the market so he and his foreign buddies can buy up stocks at a great low price.

1231 2018-04-03 15:58:57 Yes, but one could make an argument it can be from November 2017 to Jan 2018, when stocks were rising vertically in blow off top — and broke all kinds of records with no volatility, days above 200 day MA and MINIMUM drawdowns.

1237 2018-04-03 15:56:03 Well when their IPO goes public, they’ll be able to get more money into the company from the stocks and that could potentially increase how much they pay artists. But that could take a year or so until they’re well established in the stock market.
1238 2018-04-03 15:56:02 The OPCW investigated months ago and said Russia no longer had capabilities to make this nerve-agent. The only ones we know of who do have stocks are the UK, Israel and the US.

2) A non-story of Ben Carson doing nothing illegal.
3) Trump real estate business doing real estate

1279 2018-04-03 15:42:16 It doesn't matter that someone found 3 tech stocks that closely track AMZ deltas.  I 
could find 3 tech stocks that spiked over the last 7 days too.

It's the Trumpkins behavior we find objectionable.  

He promotes Sinclair and Slanders WAPO.  

SHOULD NOT HAPPEN!!!
1280 2018-04-03 15:41:39 . @SpeakerRyan If Obama went after an American company and caused their stocks to tank you would have been apoplectic. You would have screamed for impeachment. What are you doing?!?! And why?!?!

1287 2018-04-03 15:38:54 Zippy, you have no clue. Your personal issue with @washingtonpost and your poor ratings, has nothing to do with @amazon or @JeffBezos. I wonder if the stock holders can sue you for devaluing their stocks?

1289 2018-04-03 15:38:37 Unless you are retiring in a couple of years, you don’t need to fret over the day-to-day stock market corrections. And if you are retiring soon, your money shouldn’t be in stocks anyway.

1293 2018-04-03 15:37:55 Tech stocks are up circa 40% in 2017 without corresponding rise in profits. Trump could've acted like a perfect little choir boy, this correction is a long time coming.

1295 2018-04-03 15:37:41 There is no way anyone could think the tax cut lead to the stock market decrease. The tax cut has lead to huge increases in stock buybacks, lowering the float and increasing price of remaining stocks. It *is* relevant to biz voters that the market is down since the tax-cut passed
1296 2018-04-03 15:37:40 Instead of guns and jails and death penalty, cant we go back to middle age torture methods?  No one dies.  Even the stocks in middle of city would do.
1297 2018-04-03 15:37:23 @WeObject2016 @GOP @SenSchumer  How long are all of you going to allow this abuse of power by DJT against Amazon? This is just so wrong and is not just having an effect on stocks. Small businesses,pensions,401ks etc..
Yet you all remain DO SOMETHING!
1298 2018-04-03 15:36:58 aaaaaand stocks appear to be tumbling again..... volatility is BACK, friends!
1299 2018-04-03 15:36:23 Smoke and mirrors from failing trump; more money in your paycheck puts people in a higher tax bracket next year. Putting money in your left hand and taking it out of your right hand . Corporations are mostly buying back their own stocks not giving it out.

1302 2018-04-03 15:35:47 They say stocks seem to be recovering today. Inshallah.
1303 2018-04-03 15:35:30 A solid morning for stocks, but close will be critical after yesterday's bleeding. Is it #TurnaroundTuesday?
1304 2018-04-03 15:35:10 The thing is also thinking about this, Amazon stocks fell briefly then regained and then went up. Your big mouth is costing the American people trillions of dollars. Your little trade war, not going too well either. The office of the President of the USA is one of gravitas.
1305 2018-04-03 15:35:08 $SPY $QQQ and many stocks oversold by a variety of metrics and some selling extremes registered yesterday. Random news flow having more effect on weaker markets however. Reward vs risk odds getting better. There are few perfect entries and sometimes they don't work out.

1307 2018-04-03 15:34:24 Do your research before believing fake news. Fake news doesn't just come from the media. Amazon pays taxes started during Obama which is why they charge sales tax. If they are so bad why does Trump own stocks in Amazon?

1312 2018-04-03 15:33:13 It's fucking INSANE that folks are "arguing" that they have lots of emotionally disturbed teenagers who don't (yet) commit mass murder so everything is hunky-dory. BULLSHIT!

1320 2018-04-03 15:32:15 Said differently - as long as US stocks never fall again, US incomes can keep rising & US consumer debt loads will not be a problem.

1322 2018-04-03 15:31:52 No doubt shortening Amazon stocks while at it. Like he did with steal. Is manipulating the stockmarket the clown. Only interest as pres, is to cash in personally.

1329 2018-04-03 15:28:34 Why is nobody stopping this moron? He's allowed to do things no other President could. From claiming certain news agencies are fake to attacking companies and causing declining stocks, he seems to have no consequences. Washington is silent.

1331 2018-04-03 15:28:13 Now that trumps given Wall Street their tax cuts he’s calling the shots on stocks. That’s the way that “one hand washes the other” works
1332 2018-04-03 15:27:59 The big question for the market right now according to @john_augustine. Is the growth trade over? Tech stocks get taken down but buyers eventually keep coming back.

I refused to buy based on PE and regretted it. Made money on other stocks, but not AMZN money.
1334 2018-04-03 15:27:29 Where is the Securities and Exchange Commission? Why aren't they suing @POTUS for spreading false allegations and lies causing @Amazon stocks to tanl! WTF!
1335 2018-04-03 15:27:26 The stock market's losses are all news-driven, mostly being dragged down by Tech stocks.
- Facebook and their arrogance about our data
- Trump attacking Amazon
- Tesla's tragic death with a self-driving car
Companies' earnings will hopefully show that the economy is still strong.

1337 2018-04-03 15:26:58 I hear you - but what "remedies" have really been tried?

Are bump stocks banned yet? Has Congress put it up for a vote?

Background checks?

Spousal abusers?

People on no-fly list banned from getting guns?  And these are mostly suspected terrorist sympathizers.
1338 2018-04-03 15:26:48 Their tactics equates to progress in digital world that benefits average persons, such as receiving next day deliveries in rural areas; often shipping is free. Equating a company that employs 500,000 people as 'anti-labor' defies credulity. Trump tweets tanks stocks like Amazon.

1388 2018-04-03 15:10:40 We don’t know if they are shorting these stocks for their benefit. Carl Icahn for example made a bundle of $$ selling steel stocks before Trump announced tariffs. Maybe his buddies are doing the same with other stocks and commodities.

1392 2018-04-03 15:09:19 The fact that Trump will claim any boost in the stocks, but when it drops it has nothing to do with his is sad yet funny.

1395 2018-04-03 15:08:03 Ok. When Trump touted the rising stocks, Velshi & Ruehle went on & on about how most Americans didn't own stock and it was the rich, blah blah blah. Now, he trashes Amazon, and all of you are going to die. #MSNBC
1396 2018-04-03 15:08:02 I think #spotify choose a wrong time for #spotifyipo. Same goes for the drop box. VC will cash out while the other investors will be in for a ride. The shorts will have field day with these two stocks especially when there's economic downturn.

1411 2018-04-03 15:03:07 I love this pendulum game in the stock market. It is something I always come to think about-to assess and analyze the stocks I owned which I believe has entered now into correction territory.
1412 2018-04-03 15:03:05 I hope this is worth it to you while the stocks sink and people lose money just because of your ego.
1413 2018-04-03 15:03:02 Stocks have now lost more in the 2nd quarter of this year than in any year since the Great Depression. Donald Trump is going to bankrupt America—morally and financially—before he goes down in flames.
1414 2018-04-03 15:02:59 Stocks have caught a huge bid over the last few minutes.  Nasdaq $QQQ now up over 1%.
1415 2018-04-03 15:02:36 #Stocks - #Amazon | We expect more chatter out of the White House on Amazon throughout Trump’s time in office. We, however, believe that little will change which has the potential to negatively impact Amazon’s growth trajectory. cc. @PiperJaffrayCo $AMZN $NDX

1435 2018-04-03 14:54:09 @stocks_william
1436 2018-04-03 14:53:51 FACT!! THIS IS ALSO THE TRUE REASON TRUMP IS ATTACKING AMAZON & OTHER COMPANIES. Trump has put most of the money he has invested in the market into so-called value stocks, which tend to do better when the market drops than other companies. TRUMP HAS TO MANY ETHICAL CONFLICTS!!!
1437 2018-04-03 14:53:48 i think stocks go up, its bullish.  when markets stop going up on good news it is usually an important high.
1438 2018-04-03 14:53:32 Let's not degrade the conversation. We are strangers so we should at least maintain a respectful level of discourse. Speaking generally, yes, you have a good point. But speaking generally is lazy thinking. Most? perhaps, but it is not the case with ALL stocks in otc.
1439 2018-04-03 14:53:28 Ok @realDonaldTrump... we need you to pump stocks rather than crush them.

How about you and @JeffBezos kiss and make up? Maybe a tweet about how you think new borns should be issued a social security number and Prime membership at birth. $AMZN #MAGA

1441 2018-04-03 14:53:19 Great program! My tip of the day is don't rely on single stocks. Diversify, diversify, diversify! Minimize risk. Aim to build wealth over time, not overnight. #FinLitMonth

1445 2018-04-03 14:52:01 Hello sir,

Big fan of urs.

Sir, do you consider base stage before buying into growth stocks??

Both bepl and Goa carbon seem to in 4 or 5 base stage.
1446 2018-04-03 14:51:44 If I had the money to buy stocks, I'd buy stocks in Amazon. In a war between Amazon and Trump, my bet would be on Bezos and Amazon.

1449 2018-04-03 14:50:55 It really comes down to research. I don't spend much time with it, tangible assets are a more reliable thing to invest your money in - but you could really come up big with stocks with just a couple of smart moves.
1450 2018-04-03 14:50:12 You have to seriously consider that he’s really doing this to play the market and make lots of money off of both stocks and shorts (betting that a company will LOSE money). We already know he gave insider information to Icahn about tariffs
1451 2018-04-03 14:50:00 Now going on tv saying ban guns or bum stocks when this pathetic kid who's never really worked is wining bout guns

1454 2018-04-03 14:49:47 Which makes me wonder: why are stocks dropping?
1455 2018-04-03 14:49:23 Not really. Context is key.  First the DJIA is an antiquated (30 stocks) measurement. Secondly,  context — the marts crashed prior to his inauguration and the fed pumped billions of $$ into system. But liberal narrative.
1456 2018-04-03 14:48:57 Hey I got an idea, How about we all buy Amazon stocks today !! oh that would really piss you off wouldn't it!! You are such a douche with your personal vendetta against a REAL BUSINESS MAN , Isn't there a crime you're about to be charged with, They should add Stock Market fixing
1457 2018-04-03 14:48:10 @CamilleCombal idée pour écouler les stocks de grattoirs @VirginTonicOff.

Contacter les faux comptes d'arnaque et leurs proposer de donner de vrais grattoirs plutôt que de faux iPhones ;)
1458 2018-04-03 14:47:45 I thought/said the same when he tanked other stocks. I'm SURE it's being thoroughly investigated.
1459 2018-04-03 14:47:45 For Trump supporters & Amazon stock investors: Is anyone pissed that Trump is making Amazon’s stocks crumble, therefore making you lose money?!? 
1460 2018-04-03 14:47:35 So funny to watch circular logic on #twitter.

Stock gurus saying Crypto is going up and pulling up stocks.

Crypto gurus saying stocks rising so it'll pull crypto up.

No wonder fundamental analysts are moving to #CostaRica
1461 2018-04-03 14:47:11 I assume Jeff Bezos is buying while Amazon’s stock’s low to protect himself from an aggressive take over. When the stocks recover  @realDonaldTrump may have made Bezos even wealthier. He’s already much much richer than @POTUS #MAGA tell me again what a deal maker he is? #Impeach
1462 2018-04-03 14:47:03 I am purely interested in valuations of stocks and cannabis stock valuations only make sense to those hopelessly in love. No bias from me. I own or have owned every type of 'sin' stock that is public. At the right price.
1463 2018-04-03 14:46:37 I have come to develop an interest in stocks but I need tutoring before I venture into buying and selling of stocks. Any ideas/advice @ugodre and @Nairametrics ?
1464 2018-04-03 14:46:09 Hear me out:

- I become majority shareholder of Spotify
- I'm all like, "Streaming IS the future" at board meetings. Ppl cheer.
- I keep it in the back of my mind how I'm actually anti-Spotify
- Never mention it
- Retire rich
1465 2018-04-03 14:45:58 @realDonaldTrump Have you seen what they are saying about the stock market? The 6 month stretch that kicked off Monday is worst-performing period for stocks of any in the 4 year Presidential cycle dating all the way back to 1929.
1466 2018-04-03 14:45:45 Anyone losing $ on stocks owned by companies personally attacked by Trump(because he is jealous or he wants personal financial or political gain)should suit Trump 4miss use of his office 2manipulate the market 2his advantage.He has the power 2 shift the market with his rethoric.
1467 2018-04-03 14:45:33 Seriously?? They don't care that the stocks are dropping like a bad habit, just as long as their MOONSHINE STILL and their COUSIN still put out.
@JaneError
1468 2018-04-03 14:45:10 This analysis ignores the potentially catastrophic and long lasting consequences of Trump's latest stunt, especially in light of the fact that 2nd quarter stocks came in at the lowest level since the Great Depression just yesterday.
1469 2018-04-03 14:45:07 No Jeff Bezos owns a newspaper who's looking into your corruption so this is you attacking back.  That's the truth. Hurting stocks doing so. You should be arrested.
1470 2018-04-03 14:44:46 Is today the day we get yields higher and stocks lower?
1471 2018-04-03 14:44:12 @realDonaldTrump Little donald should keep his yap shut and stop playing the stock market with tweets so junior will buy lower price stocks.  that is criminal and you should be locked up for treason and hate crimes.

1474 2018-04-03 14:43:40 Overcoming weak global cues and choppy trade, Sensex and Nifty ended higher today. This is the fourth session of gains for Indian markets in five days. Markets were well supported by gains in banking stocks. Auto, healthcare sectors also posted strong gains.
1475 2018-04-03 14:43:17 Took the money I put aside to purchase Yeezys and used it to invest in some stocks instead. Thought I’d be more proud of myself but hey

1479 2018-04-03 14:42:27 This week kicked off with more bad news for tech stocks, dragging major U.S. indexes into correction territory. Too much money has been herded into too few stocks.
1480 2018-04-03 14:42:24 Stocks up 12,000 under Obama.....5,000 under Trump
1481 2018-04-03 14:42:05 @Tesco I notice that you have stopped selling frozen sweet potato online. Any reason why & any chance you might bring it back? Annoying that I am now going to have to look for a different online supermarket which stocks it 
1482 2018-04-03 14:41:54 Are you telling me that I need to occupy the phone line of the office to use this internet thing? I can read the stocks in the newspaper and not miss a single call. Where's a payphone around here? I got paged.
1483 2018-04-03 14:41:50 Now that it's gone public, Spotify will sort investors' stocks into 4-5 separate playlists
1484 2018-04-03 14:41:05 Saw this running up yesterday. Just didnt  get in. My mistake... Got into Deel instead in the sevens. Hoping that Deel pays out
1485 2018-04-03 14:40:11 I love this guy, he can bring socialist on the side of big corporations! But honestly leave AZ alone, unless he wants revenge against WP. I mean it’s completely justified the way they write about him. I would go after them every day until everyone starts selling AZ stocks.
1486 2018-04-03 14:40:01 That is true. But tech stocks in general have been sliding because of worries about the Facebook (FB) data scandal, President Trump's feud with Amazon and the prospect of increased regulation.

So even if Spotify's future looks promising, the timing for the stock sale
1487 2018-04-03 14:39:54 "Demand for the stock could be crazy. Big mutual funds will start buying the stock," he said. "There's really no difference between a direct listing and Day 181 of a lockup. Stocks don't collapse after a lockup ends."

1493 2018-04-03 14:39:27 when Amazon pays USPS more, Amazon will reverse the increase to the American taxpayer.  So don’t try that argument.   Please drop this Amazon thing of yours. You are wasting time and costing Amazon stocks to go down costing your friends money.

1527 2018-04-03 14:33:02 If you are trying to base miners on fundamentals, I say good luck. Investors could care less about this sector, regardless of Q1 earnings. It's a bunch of speculators gambling in gdx/gdxj. The lack of institutional investment is why these stocks are near their all time lows.

1529 2018-04-03 14:32:59 I hope someone is monitoring Trump-related short selling of Amazon stocks.
1530 2018-04-03 14:32:55 Even without @realDonaldTrump tweeting about @Amazon, the trade war issues would have caused Amazon to fall with the rest of the stocks.

1544 2018-04-03 14:29:44 Thanks, I always need all the luck I can get with the trades I take. I rarely enter stocks which currently trades on high volumes except if i'm day trading. I like entering when the volume is still low if you can see from my tweets you should know how i work.
1545 2018-04-03 14:29:35 You gotta surround yourself with folks who want more for themselves and push you. We talk about stocks and investments then go hit the bar. Or talk about investments AT the bar. It’s about balance, yeah we have fun but we on (own) our shit.

1547 2018-04-03 14:29:28 Look where my stocks at, study my process
1548 2018-04-03 14:29:01 Do U have a stock portfolio?  It's a lot more complicated than "buy low, sell high", believe me. We aren't talking about buying right now, we want our stocks 2 at least hold their value, & yield good dividends, for starters. The value of your portfolio changes daily, up or down.
1549 2018-04-03 14:28:56 Do I buy and quick sell Spotify stocks??

1554 2018-04-03 14:28:05 can't we just save money and buy stocks from sm like elfs did?
1555 2018-04-03 14:27:48 That is not all firearms by a long shot. High capacity magazines and stocks are used by mass shooters it is to keep people safe not to keep people from owning any firearm. Thoughts and prayers are simply not cutting it and when our politicians are bought it is time for reform

This increase in India is somehow, unrelated. Unless, it is based on import stocks and inventory.
1562 2018-04-03 14:26:33 Stocks leading credit so far. Europe sold off more as we opened.

1572 2018-04-03 14:25:20 Stocks lost more in the 2nd quarter of this year than any year since the Great Depression.
1573 2018-04-03 14:25:11 To sue the speculators who trade stocks based on public figures making allegedly false statements? This also looks like a problem of investors acting in herd-like behavior. Why trade on the basis of news instead of on the basis of knowing company’s financials and management?
1574 2018-04-03 14:24:55 In F&O... FIIs were once again net sellers in index futures and stocks futures.
while they bought in index options which was hedge buying of index calls and puts which fiis do on start of new series so nothing big in it
1575 2018-04-03 14:24:21 i'll reiterate, the components look a lot weaker than the general indexes, most are being held up by a few key high market cap players, of which most are trendy overvalued momentum stocks that don't have the actual equity or earnings to back their price

1597 2018-04-03 14:19:37 Well, stocks were pretty comfortable with his expected economic policies for a long time, but it’s amazing how long markets were able to shrug off this risk. For a system that’s supposed to price itself according to expectations it really failed to foresee an obvious possibility.

1656 2018-04-03 14:04:40 Automation not corporations shipping jobs overseas bigger job killer. Greatest job killer giving no strings attached tax cuts ( which are an expense to the economy not a cost saving) to corporations already rich who used it to buy back own stocks. No consumer demand = no jobs.

1671 2018-04-03 14:01:45 TRULY DISTURBING! @POTUS actions & words have consequences, but he doesn't care. Trump outright lied about Amazon caused a their stocks to decline by 5%, costing retiree's 401Ks billions because he doesn't like Washington Post. Manipulation of stock market by anyone is illegal.
1672 2018-04-03 14:01:19 "bourne"???? I thought you had the best words and went to the best schools. I guess you daddy's money paid for that lie.

1674 2018-04-03 14:01:01 Bump stocks weren't used in the Las Vegas massacre. Multiple gun experts that have listened to the acoustics have debunked the bump stock Las Vegas myth. It was a belt feed set-up. Gun enthusiasts know bump stocks are unusable. "We can do more as a society" = more gun control.

1687 2018-04-03 13:58:46 I bet you are beating your chest, just like the king of the jungle, that your tweets tanked the tech stocks yesterday. Fix the pension problem at the post office and they will be profitable.

1692 2018-04-03 13:57:47 Crony capitalist behaviours. Should be viewed as unethical. Also can someone look into if Trump is low key buying Amazon stocks. While he causes it to dip
1693 2018-04-03 13:57:30 I teach you now is a good time to stay away from the stocks if you want short term gains cos the bull run is over and we're nearing the election. Unless if you wanna buy long term, now is an okay time to buy cos most stocks are cheap.

1773 2018-04-03 13:35:25 He still seems to support a lot of useless gun control laws like Fixnics when Government submission is broken and banning toy bump stocks which is an accessory slippery slope and if I'm not mistaken both supported by the NRA. Correct me if I'm wrong. Life member.

1827 2018-04-03 13:20:43 Since the @potusnintentionally brought down @amazon stocks, should he he not set up a commission to assist those that saw decreases in their 401 k with no fault of their own?

1857 2018-04-03 13:09:44 The market is way too expensive and especially so for tech stocks. I'm not touching this with a ten foot pole. Massive downside risk, limited upside.

1888 2018-04-03 12:59:17 felt like a large asset allocation went through yesterday...out of stocks and into bonds...notice how stocks acted a bit better once bond mkt closed...today seeing reversal of that so far.
1889 2018-04-03 12:59:02 When that didn’t happen, the stocks dropped and took a while to recover. I think that this dry spell is because of a lack of encouraging news. Hopefully the remaining provinces announce their distribution plan soon.
1890 2018-04-03 12:58:52 @foxandfriends Could you comment on Amazon, I'm thinking of buying some stocks and if you could talk about  Amazon again I'm sure the president would Twitter about them and the price would go down.
1891 2018-04-03 12:58:24 Spotify avoids the road show, the primary market, the secondary market, no lead bank underwriter, no stocks lock down period. As a startup I respect the hustle but I think they can be the Netflix of music if they start making original  content.
1892 2018-04-03 12:58:16 People who play the stock market love this up and down. It gives them plenty of opportunity to buy and sell and make money for themselves at the expense of the stocks held by non players. Remember  selling steel before the tariff announcement
1893 2018-04-03 12:57:58 @cnnbrk @TheLeadCNN @realDonaldTrump Something tells me that Trump lashing out at AMAZON and others lowers the stock prices so his rich friends can buy up stocks at lower prices, CNN should investigate Pay to Play

1898 2018-04-03 12:57:26 I beginning to think you have a stock scam going where you tweet something that causes a market drop, meanwhile buying stocks through one of your businesses. A week later when the stock rises, you sell making a quick profit.

Sounds like the type of crooked scam you’re know for.

1938 2018-04-03 12:43:08 1. It was not actual uranium it was stocks.

2. It was a stock sale in a small portion. 

3. The sale was approved by many government agencies including the office Clinton held. 

4. It was a negotiation tool not a conspiracy. Done in the light of day.
1939 2018-04-03 12:42:38 Oh and how come no talk of the stocks falling because of your mouth and ridiculous tariffs.

1952 2018-04-03 12:38:22 Who’s “number nobody”? The vast majority of the country want universal background checks, to limit those deemed a risk to others from obtaining firearms, and prohibitions on bump stocks. Seems like the only “nobody’s” are the politicians advocating to weaponize teachers 
1953 2018-04-03 12:36:50 Own real estate in addition to stocks. The kind people always need doctors offices etc. I’m not talking about REITs.

1954 2018-04-03 12:34:28 From a breadth perspective, there are currently less stocks at 5,10,20 and 50-day lows compared to the prior March low. The Average momentum level is also higher for the S&P component stocks. These are bullish short-term signs for the market.

1956 2018-04-03 12:33:55 Hey @realDonaldTrump Why aren't you tweeting about the market now! You and your chorts shorted a bunch of tech stocks right before you went after Amazon and FB! Jobs being lost daily, new construction being delayed due to feared cost overruns because of your Tarriffs!
1957 2018-04-03 12:33:30 One of the largest employers in the country most of whom have some form of stocks in the country.  @realDonaldTrump is so petty he doesn't mind abusing other Americans.
1958 2018-04-03 12:33:28 There's no defense for this behavior. Hard working Americans own stocks in these companies, and they're supposed to lose money because we have an 11yo for president. I hope he moves on to having a massive heart attack
1959 2018-04-03 12:32:58 When the latest wage report came out, stocks went down because near 0 unemployment + higher wages = less profits as competition for labor increases.  When profits go down and wages go up, prices go up to compensate, causing inflation.
1960 2018-04-03 12:32:31 It would not surprise me if the Trump family previously bet on falling Amazon stocks ... right, Mr. @realDonaldTrump ?

1991 2018-04-03 12:20:14 Time for the SEC to look into your dealings. Yesterday you tweeted and took the stock market for a ride. Today your buddies who obviously knew what you were going to do will buy back the stocks that tumbled. Been going on for a couple months now.
1992 2018-04-03 12:20:09 Agaun I'd give you facts but you like all liberals would not listen. Yes, I mean ONLY 459 points.

2023 2018-04-03 12:01:39 Little hands donnie, ya cant fix stupid. The lower stocks go because of u, the more u lie, the more hate and ignorance u spew, the more they love u. U must be so proud. U should hit 60% when Mueller indicts U!
2024 2018-04-03 12:01:35 Stocks tanked again yesterday. I don’t hear you boasting about it.

2029 2018-04-03 11:59:11 That’s unnerved the markets. Steep declines on Monday left stocks down more than 4 percent this year, and shares had their first quarterly decline since 2015.
2030 2018-04-03 11:59:09 If stocks are going back up, that must mean crypto is going to tank again.
2031 2018-04-03 11:57:45 I miss the days of Obama ragetweeting about the media and doing his best to tank the stocks of companies he felt were somehow hostile towards him.
2032 2018-04-03 11:56:18 Obama still better than you and your will be in the again when stocks crash Donnie does daycare know your on the lose again
2033 2018-04-03 11:55:42 @POTUS , you used to brag about how you directly raised our stocks with your leadership. Now your stupid tweets have effected our stocks to drop, I think you get off on the power of the office weather good for us or not. You’re just like a dictator!
2034 2018-04-03 11:55:39 Just curious, how many of Trump’s cronies and family have shorted company stocks before one of his tweets? #MorningJoe #realDonaldTrump #WaPo #NYTimes #cnn #MuellerAlreadyKnows
2035 2018-04-03 11:54:40 But it's not just about stocks. We're talking jobs! If this war with Amazon continues, he's going to end up costing jobs! I know people working for Amazon, and it's the difference between being able to exist, or being out on the street. Congress needs to censure him!

2038 2018-04-03 11:53:30 Fact is, you are a typlib and would argue about a door. Fact is, the Economy is doing better than it has in the last 10 Presidential terms. The long term economic pattern is very good, and the Chinese stocks are going down, and will until they capitulate and reform. Is that clear
2039 2018-04-03 11:52:41 Go ahead an tweet more witty shit to make stocks go down again!
2040 2018-04-03 11:52:27 How much do his tweets affect low PE or high dividend stocks...
2041 2018-04-03 11:52:05 Now is the time to buy. Stocks are selling at a discount.
2042 2018-04-03 11:51:28 Nor will they keep from finding out which stocks to short.
2043 2018-04-03 11:51:21 Thing is if they did come out and say for example ‘we will be out of the film business by 2021 and are now only selling stocks and not producing film’.  Would that not lead to a jump in prices for Fuji films so bad for consumers?
2044 2018-04-03 11:50:17 One of my goals this year was to save and start budgeting to invest. But,  the way the stocks look these days..  Maybe I'll just save and talk to an advisor anyway.

2047 2018-04-03 11:49:20 WAKE UP @cnn @CNNPolitics @brianstelter Trump and his cronies are shorting the stocks of the companies he pans. Just like Bin Laden did on 911. #FollowTheMoney
2048 2018-04-03 11:49:16 Trade wars are bad for stocks. Less profits and more uncertainty. Markets hate both. So yeah - Trump has def been a key catalyst for the recent slide.

To be fair, his anti-regulation stance has been a catalyst for the surge in 2017.

2055 2018-04-03 11:45:31 FAKE NEWS!! Bump stocks became available during Obama admin and were categorized as an accessory because of it’s intended purpose, use by those w/disability, not overly weaponizing a weapon of war. But just like the White House, ended in the wrong hands.

2057 2018-04-03 11:44:06 Mike what's the point of retweeting this? It's from October. The DOJ already formulated a regulation prohibiting bump stocks. Are you one of them there Iranian trolls?
2058 2018-04-03 11:44:05 Yup, probably insider trading, he can literally make stocks go up or down by his actions, I wish I knew what he was going to do so I could make enough money to take a 3 year vacation
2059 2018-04-03 11:44:02 Desperately trying to manipulate more stocks? Is there ANOTHER secret deal with a broadcaster? Mr. Mueller is watching.

2074 2018-04-03 11:37:10 I don’t understand why Trump is screwing with Americans savings, ie., 401ks, etc because he is upset with the awesome @washingtonpost. If you had $100k in your plan, you lost $5-$10k yesterday. Does Trump who has very little in stocks understand how long it takes to save $5-$10k?

We would start to buy stocks when we see the S&P 500 at the 2,500 threshold."

2083 2018-04-03 11:33:44 Which stocks should buy after a market correction? 
Answer: The stocks which performed well before the market declined and lagged when it fell.
2084 2018-04-03 11:33:40 @realDonaldTrump hey man donrealize what those stocks mean too many many voting Americans that work for Amazon?  Not cool.
2085 2018-04-03 11:33:29 Gun owners want to own guns fix them to make them military style with bump stocks, and shoot kids in schools.

2097 2018-04-03 11:28:58 If Trump wants to go after Amazon that's his right but every time he does it it hurts Amazon stocks which in turn could hurt the stock market because if Amazon stocks go down the stock market goes down too.

2105 2018-04-03 11:24:17 Markets are down worldwide overnight, with a few odd exceptions. US indices seem to be set to open slightly up. We’ll see if that translates to actual gains. The trade war saber rattling and the general tanking of tech stocks due to the unhinged Amazon tirade suggest not.

2146 2018-04-03 11:05:36 Just remember as the stock market falls due to Trumps war on Amazon Trump most likely suffers little due to most money being real estate not stocks.  Plus he doesn’t worry about the scam of a 401k #Trump #Amazon
2147 2018-04-03 11:05:20 Oh boy, $AMZN -1% premarket. Will this be another day where FANG stocks take us lower after the open?
2148 2018-04-03 11:04:41 Putin does not care about that.  The falling stocks are collateral damage.
2149 2018-04-03 11:04:38 Tidbit from this morning’s Brief with some particular resonance: 

"Bloomberg reported that stocks were on track for their worst April since 1929."
2150 2018-04-03 11:04:00 Not true. I've held plenty of small stocks, for a long time. I've done plenty of research on them. There are certain criteria you have to look for. Very few go bust. Some of my biggest disappointers have been revenue generators who have missed their targets.
2151 2018-04-03 11:03:25 I don't tweet anymore about stocks and portfolio. I have learnt to develop patience for long term investing. Stay invested and cut the noise!
2152 2018-04-03 11:02:00 Earnings fuel stocks and that’s a fact!  Stay tuned
2153 2018-04-03 11:01:31 Joe,  I started selling my stocks and going short when the Nunnes memo came out.  I have been net short since.  My reasons for selling are 199% Trump.  Is he not doing everything to destroy America?  Kill Solar jobs, Tech Jobs , create coal jobs and Wars?
2154 2018-04-03 11:00:49 Isn’t it a shame that the stock market can’t ignore trump’s delusional behavior. Medical stocks should be way up along with any liquor stock. This guy is crazy. I feel like buying everything on Amazon!
2155 2018-04-03 11:00:40 Why have you stopped tweeting about the stock market? You see how your erratic behavior is tanking stocks. Collusion, collusion, collusion.

2158 2018-04-03 10:59:03 February, 2018 (as stocks rally): "The 30 year bond bull market is dead because we broke a trendline on a chart"

April, 2018 (as bonds rally) "The bull market in stocks is over because we're breaking a trendline on a chart."

2159 2018-04-03 10:59:00 @realDonaldTrump ‘s insanity forced stocks down more than 4 percent this year, and shares had their first quarterly decline since 2015 when the hugely popular President Obama was in office. #DumpTrump

2174 2018-04-03 10:50:21 I guess the investigation would find that each of those three tweets contained a clear sign of this being an April's fools. None of them should be misunderstood by someone capable of investing in stocks. (not that they were very funny, but...)

Swings both ways though. Strange how the equity wealth effect is often cited as a support to US consumer spending when stocks are on the up. Usually cited as the response to the relationship between stocks and retail sales.

2225 2018-04-03 10:20:32 let me guess, amazon is and has been trading on the stock exchange, one tweet from fuck-knuckle and stocks for amazon tumbles, and i wonder who gets rich from this, maybe his rich banker friends who have vested interest in the stock market  
2226 2018-04-03 10:18:14 Prob. But there are now more ETFs than investable stocks listed on US exchanges. Thus the index universe has essentially become a bigger, crowded momentum trade. Where will index funds/ETFs find buyers for over-weighted, highly appreciated holdings if they become forced sellers?
2227 2018-04-03 10:17:01 This is the tweet I got the information from about the stocks & Bloomberg.

2259 2018-04-03 09:56:40 The only reason the stock market isn't in a free fall is because the tax cut which was promised to go to increase wages is going to buy back companies stocks to keep corp exec stock options at inflated rates. Many companies using 80% of the tax cut windfall.

2398 2018-04-03 08:12:00 Kind of amazing when you think that the tax cut was mainly targeted at corporations by @GOP and @realDonaldTrump ; stocks should have gone up even if the economy as a whole didn't.
2399 2018-04-03 08:10:46 .@realDonaldTrump has no morals, he's spiteful & revenge fueled. He doesn't like Jeff Bezos, so he doesn't like Amazon. "Amazon has lost $60Bill in mkt value since Axios rptd Trump is 'obsessed' with the company on March 28." Trump is tanking tech stocks. Innocent ppl losing $$.

2557 2018-04-03 06:27:00 Agreed the CFP was about conserving fish stocks. Yeah maybe there should be some analysis of the current policy but I never trust any group with single issue politics. The fishermen did well in the 60’s to 80’s and some made a lot of money but they fished the arse out of the seas
2558 2018-04-03 06:26:34 No, they don't say they want to take their guns away; BUT many of their followers do.  Read tweets.  It is in the tweets!  But, I do agree that banning bump stocks and limiting the magazine capacity in common sense gun laws.

2578 2018-04-03 06:15:24 Because AR15s are high-capacity longarms firing high-velocity rounds that can be fitted with bump stocks and used to decimate a crowd in seconds. Longer range than a pistol and better accuracy in the hands of an amateur.
They have no place in the civilian market.

2596 2018-04-03 06:04:33 #cryptocurrency is risky.  Some $stocks are as well. One should invest only what one is willing to lose and should probably save at least 10% of fiat in a traditional saving vehicle. Wealth diversification.

2598 2018-04-03 06:04:09 When VCs invest in Startups, they always think long-term to see returns when they IPO in the next 5-10yrs, so they #HODL and never sell their stocks until IPO. #TRON $TRX is a 6-months old startup. When you buy $TRX or other Alts how can you expect them to explode in 6 months?!
2599 2018-04-03 06:01:55 I remember when Bill appointed Hillary to draft a report on medical care and excoriated it, what wasn't mentioned however was that the Clintons had placed huge bets (a put) against the market and cleaned up when sector stocks tanked. So ya, there was that.

2634 2018-04-03 05:36:56 Its rediculous to buy things from Xiaomi as they don't keep stocks but hype...!
2635 2018-04-03 05:36:52 Invested only the BUFFER money which can be locked for long. But had to sell some  stocks at loss. (Small Caps). Recovered the lost money by buying some ignored stocks then and sold them at 4 times the price of acquisition.  SOUTH IN BNK -bought at 5 rs before split & sold at 21.
2636 2018-04-03 05:35:56 Amazon probably saves in gas people traveling 2 the mall. Energy, gas. Why go after Amazon, like Ford your playing with stocks. U came to the White House with maybe 10 million. I plan on leaving with bill. @ what cost.A÷B=C. Short n buy back. While Dow /

2638 2018-04-03 05:34:35 Short Summary 
- Asia's stocks are lower
- U.S. tech slump deepens
- Trump critical of Amazon
- Investors rattled by trade
- Havens hold their gains
- Volatility is soaring
2639 2018-04-03 05:34:23 You’re right. But if all those bags were filled with money it would draw attention. Just like butt stocks or barrels of broken down weapons would draw attention if your teachers or administrators saw them. Oh wait, they’re clear! So that would draw some alarm and attention!

2642 2018-04-03 05:33:07 Even if blockchain succeeds, doesn’t mean any coins gain in value, let alone the current coins. Government risk is high. There’s nothing underpinning the values whatsoever. With real estate or stocks or other assets, you don’t need someone to buy at a higher price to monetize.
2643 2018-04-03 05:33:05 Also at same time Spx stocks above the 50ema should come close to zero.

2645 2018-04-03 05:32:24 When US stocks are down 2.5pc of course Asian cash stocks are going to get whacked. Why cant journos and other bozos look at futures for realtive time zone performance instead of spreading this utter shite. I guess thats why they are hacks and not traders

2649 2018-04-03 05:30:28 Last week I mentioned Spx stocks above the 200 Ema.  For markets to find support at feb lows this would have to not cross down below prior low. Already did.  Currently 46.80. So good odds as all other indicators showing of taking feb lows soon on all markets.

2653 2018-04-03 05:26:19 Asian stocks fell for a second day Tuesday amid jitters about U.S.-Chinese trade tensions and mounting public scrutiny of technology companies.
2654 2018-04-03 05:25:48 Trump, even Warren Buffet buy up stocks when the price goes low then sell when they're high. All this false deflating and inflating via speculators tends to make enormous profits and allow for buyouts at bargain prices. It's a rich mans game, the tax cut was a wafer.
2655 2018-04-03 05:25:19 I sold three stocks on the list of Libtard companies.  Plenty of other fish in the sea to invest my money into.  These companies need to make products/provide services instead of playing politics.

2660 2018-04-03 05:19:07 Interesting to see how there is no domestic support for Trump's good and easy to win Trade War on China  Stocks are sliding- the worst since great depression and many foreign companies are delaying US bound investments. China can cut on the services import from US- brahmastra?
2661 2018-04-03 05:18:37 The rich will simply go on a buying spree for cheap stocks when the market collapses. A market collapse will hurt workers and small businesses. Trump's people STILL won't blame Trump. They'll blame "bankers." (Dogwhistle term for Jews.)

2678 2018-04-03 05:11:42 Markets did not exactly rest on Monday and resurrected the risk-off theme rather quickly for stocks and the JPY. Things remain tricky with the USD trade and I basically already had the small move back before more USD strength happen on EURUSD and GBPUSD - unclear if sustainable.

2684 2018-04-03 05:09:37 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
2685 2018-04-03 05:09:25 Trump’s fanatic followers aren’t the type of people who own stocks. They could care less about the market and have no clue as to how it functions. They just want to sit in their double-wides with their 40s.
2686 2018-04-03 05:08:54 Buy up a bunch of real estate, write up your own mortgage papers, and then trade the estates in exchange for stocks and bonds instead of money. Call me Tai Lopez and thank me later.

Stocks, but for people. If I see potential in someone as a person & want to be involved in whatever they do, I can buy stock in that person.

No clue how it’d be done, but I think it’d be really cool to have honestly!
2689 2018-04-03 05:05:01 Every time my stocks drop I think "Did Papa Spraytan open his mouth again?" and the response is usually some form of "Yeah, p much."
2690 2018-04-03 05:04:44 Ban sale and possession of bump stocks. I'm pretty sure that the Constitution is the law of the land, not just for the Feds, and the 2nd Amdt still says, "shall not be infringed".   Full auto machine guns were banned because of gangsters proliferation due to illegit Prohibition.

2703 2018-04-03 04:56:55 The tax cut might be good for corporate expenses in the short run, but were too narrow to stimulate much consumer spending. The increased borrowing proly will drive up interest %s and inflation. It will also hike returns on bonds, which will pull some money away from stocks....

2750 2018-04-03 04:29:46 long-term bearish trend starts for $aapl $fb. gonna see bounces for sure but i don't think it's wise to invest in stocks of these two names any more, until conditions totally reversed and things are moving in the right direction. if they can't change, down HARD next few years.
2751 2018-04-03 04:29:43 When people get scare they move to the Center or Middle--Bonds & Gold(0), away from the edges(-,+)--Savings(-) & Stocks(+). When they are not scare they move back out to the edges.
2752 2018-04-03 04:29:03 We need to ban Lazy Suzans.  With one of those a gunman can spray a 360° circle of death. And, they are used in as many shootings as bump stocks.
2753 2018-04-03 04:28:16 You sold your stocks. Bwahahaha! What a fool! You actually believe your own tripe. Wish we could see how much it cost you! (If you really ever had any)

There's a lovely little inverse ETF that does that for you too.

2755 2018-04-03 04:26:29 The world is slowing. Recent data S Korea, Taiwan, Japan (Tankan) support the  story. Wider BBB spreads and weaker stocks point same way

2762 2018-04-03 04:21:29 Is this a good time to invest in stocks?
2763 2018-04-03 04:21:13 i recieved a $0.77 dividend check from the two stocks that I manage, so yea the house had a pretty good day.  @AllenMarcellus @AaronGagnon9
2764 2018-04-03 04:20:18 Why don’t you guys each put up your top 2 stocks right now for the next 2-4 weeks and hopefully you both pick winners and everybody wins in the end! Arguing is fucking STUPID! Just focus on making money and cut the drama Flex and prove you are as good as advertised
2765 2018-04-03 04:20:16 This white man at my job told me his stocks were doing well this month & wanted to pay one of my bills.
2766 2018-04-03 04:19:29 T called out Ross for causing market tank on false reports. T tweets about Amazon & stocks go down dragging market with them. He now is asking how he can "f" with Bezos & Amazon. How is it he can knowingly get away w this wo consequences. Time to act @GOP bc you're tied to T.
2767 2018-04-03 04:19:11 It can go up or down! Zero or 150k! If you are willing to risk losing all your investment go for bitcoin. If you dont want to risk losing, invest in stocks! That advice is what you pay a financial planner for. Good that I can not loose all my money in stocks #bitcoin
2768 2018-04-03 04:18:57 Yup, my 401k is taking a hit, but it'll be worth it if the stocks tank to finally wake people up.
2769 2018-04-03 04:18:41 @Laker_Steve You must have missed my response to how bad Macy's was doing.  
I showed how their stocks have went up since they released their Muslim collection.  I am waiting for a response. 
You are the one that made the original argument Sir.
2770 2018-04-03 04:18:36 @Baircave always return of sadistic stocks .   
2771 2018-04-03 04:18:09 Agreed man. I had some crazy runs a while back. I've been investing more on the stock market lately, have a 150% ROI right now. Finding good cheap stocks that are way underpriced.
2772 2018-04-03 04:17:20 Before Trump, one of my daughters lost their home, my job went overseas and I know someone who committed suicide over dropping stocks....Under Trump, another of my daughters bought a house, employers are giving large bonuses and stocks are soaring. So, ya got more ammunition?
2773 2018-04-03 04:17:16 Do you still have stocks available?
2774 2018-04-03 04:17:13 Today after 2pm, most stocks were up more than 2%. One more bull rally is due tomorrow
2775 2018-04-03 04:17:04 if they reduced the withholding tax, it'll make a huge difference & would probably see much more foreign capital inflows to yielding stocks imo #stocks
2776 2018-04-03 04:17:04 Can have nifty spot 10140 as trailing SL for all trading long in all stocks
2777 2018-04-03 04:16:29 For all Mark’s posturing, feigned compassion, and pretend morality, I noticed he moved like lightening to sell his shares before the stocks went down. Cad! It’s all about money, don’t let Left globalist lemmings Tell you different.
2778 2018-04-03 04:16:09  how’s your portfolio looking?!  I’m intrigued by your statement “Market correction” so 7,000+ is market correction is that what your saying? or your saying it’s up 7,000 because of trump!? I’ve been trading stocks for a long time

2780 2018-04-03 04:14:52 Over 20% of Americans qualify for some form of welfare. You can bet none of them own stocks, a pension, retirement savings or a 401K. They're lucky if they have a roof over their head and food on the table.
2781 2018-04-03 04:14:13 why is learning about stocks so damn complicated
2782 2018-04-03 04:13:48 This is all false.
They pay the same cost for bulk shipping as any other company. And they tax like any other company. This is so obviously about the Washington Post. You are harming everyone who has amazon stocks which include your base!
2783 2018-04-03 04:13:35 I think in that case they would probably replace the stocks with cash balance as soon as every procedure is completed, my best guess. 
2784 2018-04-03 04:13:30 GBP/USD: Eyes UK PMI, trade wars and risk aversion could hurt Pound: The GBP/USD avoided a break below 1.40 during the Easter holidays, but the relief will likely be short-lived if the trade war fears drive stocks lower and UK PMI misses estimates by a wide margin. As of…
2785 2018-04-03 04:13:16 If any of my followers are going to SG LV, let me know. Will be able to sponsor you a box of UO! while stocks last. 2 boxes only.. Heh
2786 2018-04-03 04:13:03 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
2787 2018-04-03 04:12:56 #SharekhanFNA: #SharekhanResearch maintains BUY on Bharat Electronics with TP of Rs180. Steep correction already factored earnings headwinds, stocks offers favourable risk-reward at current levels and is our preferred pick in the defence space.

2788 2018-04-03 04:12:52 Kinda like banning bump stocks....
2789 2018-04-03 04:11:29 take a look at some of their stocks since announcing. I'd say we do
2790 2018-04-03 04:11:29 Money. If you have lobbyists for like coal, gas, and other fossil fuels, talking to the administration; once the administration does their bidding, they donate to campaigns, they hold events at Trump hotels, and stocks rise for the rich (i.e. everyone in this administration)
2791 2018-04-03 04:10:45 Free investment premise:  if all @IngrahamAngle sponsors are so insecure they felt they had to buckle in a day, maybe stocks to short as brands aren’t as strong as perceived?
2792 2018-04-03 04:10:26 Yeah, really... the people who were complaining about low interest rates on their savings were people who didn't have a risk appetite...

So, he forced them into owning stocks and being landlords....  or into the poor house.
2793 2018-04-03 04:10:18 standard with a potato, they will come. I think every game dev. I like how nowhere stocks the green from the person I'm subtweeting someone who wouldn't
2794 2018-04-03 04:10:00 not as bad as this. it's not a correction, has nothing to do w/overheated/overvalued stocks. solely  a response 2 a bad trade policy. What's w/ Obama? Seems u can't defend Trump unless u talk abt Obama. Wow. U can't quit him. Stick 2 the present or we can talk abt Nixon
2795 2018-04-03 04:10:00 Tech stocks doggy style
2796 2018-04-03 04:09:59 I’m literally so down to learn myself everything bout stocks / trading / investing  and eventually get into 

but like rn is not the time. 
Give me a couples months and i’ll be a lil stock baby.
2797 2018-04-03 04:09:06 Mas mayaman pa yata sa PH govt ang Catholic Church. Stocks pa lang sa BPI nakakalula na e.
2798 2018-04-03 04:08:59 No wonder people are asking me about pot stocks
2799 2018-04-03 04:08:08 I’m currently trying to read and learn about stocks but they’re so much information 
2800 2018-04-03 04:07:42 April 02th 2018 - have you seen the stocks now?... all this it's your fault!
2801 2018-04-03 04:07:28 I need to learn more about stocks.
2802 2018-04-03 04:07:17 Asian stocks have fallen for a second day amid worries over trade tensions between the US and China. STI down about a percent before mid-day break.
2803 2018-04-03 04:06:21 $MEDH $GLFH will each hit 10.00 in 2018 and some people will be shocked, not me!
$MSPC .10+ $NBDR 5.00-7.00+
Buying $GLNNF again here too
$FUSZ 50.00+ in 2 years could become industry leader for CRMs then 100.00+ $BLPG $DIRV must own security/Pot stocks
$AHIX 5000%+ potential 
2804 2018-04-03 04:05:30 Agreed. Dinny is manipulating certain stocks and the Dow/NSDAQ for gain
2805 2018-04-03 04:05:03 If a rocket scientist can build what -if scenarios & algorithms on stocks, the rocket scientist should float their resume to Wall Street investment banks. I worked with a nuclear physicists, PhDs in Mathematics & Aerospace engineers who all developed stock models. Also major $$$
2806 2018-04-03 04:04:19 Let me guess, we should buy gold and Euro stocks???
2807 2018-04-03 04:04:18 Stocks rebound after person shoves sock in President’s mouth.
2808 2018-04-03 04:04:14 Yep, my retirement stocks are down A LOT. Like, a lot, a lot. Thanks @realDonaldTrump you really are the worst!
2809 2018-04-03 04:02:43 Fuckin with bitches with fake asses is like buying the top in stocks or crypto. The value is only gonna decline from there, it's inevitable.
2810 2018-04-03 04:02:02 "Stocks have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau." - Irving Fisher, Professor of Economics, Yale University, 1929.
2811 2018-04-03 04:01:11 Nobody in their right mind, not to be mistaken with Right mind, would listen to #Trump when it comes to stocks or business acumen. The man is NO success story! Just smut&corruption&more recently #Treason 
2812 2018-04-03 04:00:22 Until he opens.his mouth going after major corporations & knocks their stocks down.
2813 2018-04-03 03:59:27 Hope you dumped any stocks you might have had Sarah.
2814 2018-04-03 03:58:13 Both. I am for banning assault rifles and bump stocks.
2815 2018-04-03 03:57:23 Trump will be quiet and wait until the stocks rise again and then take credit for it.. Just watch. He's a predictable Sociopathic Tyrant.
2816 2018-04-03 03:56:27 We just need to him to back off on banning bump stocks.
2817 2018-04-03 03:55:37 Bila cari baju semua out of stocks. End up beli toys. Haih. This is how i wasted my money. #fml
2818 2018-04-03 03:54:00 So heartening to see a mother brag about bullying teens who've been traumatized by mass murder. By the way, nothing in the Constitution prohibits banning AR 15 and bump stocks.
2819 2018-04-03 03:53:57 The point of the blog, once again, was NOT about bump stocks. It’s about unconstitutional unilateral actions. SCOTUS will squash it when challenged.
2820 2018-04-03 03:53:21 Tumbling stocks hurt corporations & the rich.  If this keeps up, the will devour Trump.
2821 2018-04-03 03:52:56 on the plus side,  stocks of clear backpacks finish strong today as the market closes.
2822 2018-04-03 03:52:32 Last night, I thought Indian markets will open #gap #down today.  Our systems are #long stocks.  I am #happy #to #be #wrong.  Ever wondered how you can be #right and #still #lose #money ??
2823 2018-04-03 03:51:56 them stocks you got set that bitch off lol
2824 2018-04-03 03:51:45 Of course they can. Bump stocks can be made with rubber bands.

2829 2018-04-03 03:48:32 Funny, #Trump hasn't tweeted about the stock market today. Wonder why that would be... #stocks #tariffs
2830 2018-04-03 03:47:51 Stocks?
2831 2018-04-03 03:47:48 @realDonaldTrump the drop in stocks is all on you. You are to blame. #tariff fiasco
2832 2018-04-03 03:47:30 Unnerving investment strategy for 2018: Shorting stocks that have potential negative tweet value (e.g., Amazon shareholders losing $60b in value over a negative tweet). $AMZN
2833 2018-04-03 03:46:59 I'm confused but I'm buying stocks
2834 2018-04-03 03:46:22 Heat map doesn’t really tell you about role. He is playing through the guts, that map is just a reflection of Geelong having decimated defensive stocks. I would say almost no chance at all
2835 2018-04-03 03:45:54 I need to get back on my day trading #stocks
2836 2018-04-03 03:45:46 I must say, President Trump’s trade war may be making steel more expensive, but it’s certainly making stocks more affordable.
2837 2018-04-03 03:45:38 Funny thing about @realdonaldtrump's attack on @amazon stocks & it's impact on @JeffBezos, Bezos is still worth well over $100 Billion & nobody believes Trump is anywhere near the billion he claims he's worth & won't provide any proof of his stated wealth. Amazon will bounce back
2838 2018-04-03 03:44:25 of course it’s a person problem; the point of gun control measures is necessarily one of limiting damage.  the alternative, preempting those people likely to kill or harm, would be a much larger curtailing of liberty than removing bump stocks or high cap magazines.
2839 2018-04-03 03:43:10 Just read #Stocks had worst 2nd quarter start due to pressure on tech and China trade tarrifs. Meanwhile my tenants continue paying their rent and providing #cashflow #passiveincome

2849 2018-04-03 03:40:14 Yep, I honestly think he is short BYOC & getting desperate, quick search on his name & videos will find him talking about shorting stocks.  So childish tactics w/ baloney analysis that he knows is wrong.  Then his crony followers on the 10k(s). + using today's crappy market.

2856 2018-04-03 03:37:37 Sure, let's just ignore that the Fed is raising interest rates and stocks have been goosed to outrageous levels by #ZIRP for a decade. #EndTheFed
@AronEisenberg
2857 2018-04-03 03:37:36 So what? Shooting guns in a crowd is still a no-go. Also, since the shooter was up in a hotel, guns would have done zilch. A ban on bump stocks and the AR 15 on the other hand would have meant a lot of people would still be alive. It's quite simple you know.
2858 2018-04-03 03:37:12 Stocks go up and down day by day as well. I wouldnt worry about it.
2859 2018-04-03 03:34:58 Facebook has been getting negative headlines for the last couple weeks. lost value in their stocks, security, and trust of its users. All social media platforms should be more careful about invading the user's privacy. #RutgersSMMM
2860 2018-04-03 03:34:49 If assault rifles were any more deadly than the wooden rifle I shared earlier, I might agree.  Unfortunately it's not, so I won't.  If you want to ban slide fire and bump stocks, be my guest. No one seriously shooting is going to use them. 

They're made for Bubba to look cool.
2861 2018-04-03 03:33:54 That's the reason why most people say that banning bump stocks is a dumb idea. Because they're not some technological advancement that must be manufactured. Anybody can make one without purchasing anything. I couldn't care less if they were banned though.
2862 2018-04-03 03:33:05 As of 11:30 a.m., PSEi 8,028.24 down 11.21 points or 0.14 percent. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2863 2018-04-03 03:32:38 1. 88% of stock is owned by those w $1mil or more. Classic lib narrative = fuck rich people and stock market is inaccessible 
2. I know 
3. It had never hit 25k, either. To compare to previous years is dumb
4. Stocks held less than 1yr are taxed very heavily. They are held > 1yr

2865 2018-04-03 03:30:47 "trade wars are good, and easy to win." trump, March 2018
TODAY: Stocks tumble to the tune of 458 points, marking the WORST 2nd quarter start since the Great Depression.
Who KNEW trade wars would be so hard? Everyone. 

@realDonaldTrump why aren't you taking credit for this?

#MAGA
U.S. stocks had their worst April start since 1929, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
2867 2018-04-03 03:30:18 @realDonaldTrump remember wall street:money never sleeps? When Josh Brolins character manipulated stock, and toward the end he went to jail for it? Remember that with what you're doing to #Amazon. #Stocks #LockHimUp #StockMarket
2868 2018-04-03 03:29:52 I'm not against banning bump stocks though, I see no reason to own one since they're pretty terrible. But don't think that banning them stops them from being used, you can create a bump stock with a belt. They're easy to utilize, but nobody does.

2873 2018-04-03 03:28:07 Why does every correction, which are completely normal in secular bulls, automatically mean a crash is coming? Makes no sense. I go to family barbecues and more people are talking about baseball cards or the housing market than stocks.
2874 2018-04-03 03:27:28 Because, in this country a company is worried about stock holders first, customers second and employees 112th.
Companies don't make products or services, they make stocks.

2878 2018-04-03 03:24:41 The momentum investors and hedge funds are likely the first to flee the FAANG stocks. Momo people can't HODL. Hedge fund algos react to social media feeds that trigger their selling.

2880 2018-04-03 03:24:02 You are looking at how much stocks have lately gone down.  Not that they are still much higher than before President Trump took office.  The Dow was at approximately 19,000 and now it is at 23,000.
2881 2018-04-03 03:23:12 Expect a couple more bad days ahead this week. FANG stocks got the crap beat out of them, deservingly.
2882 2018-04-03 03:21:57 my twitter statistics are skyrocketing like the stocks i have invested in, catch me on wall street in a minute boys
2883 2018-04-03 03:21:42 There's only one problem with this: approximately 0% of Trumpkins have anything saved in a 401k/stocks.  So they have no "portfolios" to hurt. But this will certainly hurt them in their monthly budget when the price of everything they pay for goes up by a third.
2884 2018-04-03 03:21:24 Maybe Trump and his syndicate lieutenants are shorting stocks?
2885 2018-04-03 03:21:13 Use the dips to add (average)your portfolio stocks with a final stop loss of close below 10K on Nifty.
2886 2018-04-03 03:21:08 Why are the stocks all down? We have the Greatest President ever! People are just chickens, afraid of rumers. TRUMP has everything figured out, we will be Great again! Have faith people, ,I trust my POTUS!!
2887 2018-04-03 03:21:04 That move would make stocks take a dip, y'think?
2888 2018-04-03 03:20:56 Convexity!! Yesterday our portfolio jumped up straight 4% in a single day while it never lost 4% in a single day during the correction phase.

Smart money is buying quality small cap stocks. Are YOU?
2889 2018-04-03 03:20:26 @TheOnion Obama says he 'made millions' in gun and ammunition stocks. "All I'd do is drop some comment about a gun, and all the gun nuts went crazy buying up ammo and guns, driving prices through the roof!"
2890 2018-04-03 03:20:20 I like the way Retail and FMCG stocks are shaping up.

2895 2018-04-03 03:15:44 Extremely dangerous fascist techniques displayed by POTUS this morning. 

Attacking a company who’s owner disagrees with him-causing stocks to tank....turning corporations into state controlled markets

2898 2018-04-03 03:14:49 Are American corps sick yet of Trump’s tweeting vs the biz target of the day - sick of watching stocks decline for whichever corp is wearing his target of the moment? Didn’t they say uncertainty was ruining them? Now, on any day it’s a crap shoot & they’re happy? Really?
2899 2018-04-03 03:14:42 Focus on individual stocks is what pays. I am not in the Nifty or Sensex game. Many stocks have gone up more than 20% from lows recently.
2900 2018-04-03 03:11:15 And to think.. @IngrahamAngle has 2 million Twitter followers by herself. Good luck to all companies who made the fools choice and to their stockholders. 4 those interested there are a few others like #BoycottOfficeDepot

2904 2018-04-03 03:09:21 @Redphilly By the way, Amazon stocks are held in most retirement portfolios. It's consistency has made it a favorite.
2905 2018-04-03 03:09:18 Perhaps you haven't seen the jump from. 0001-.0005 recently?!You think you can make that kind of money in a large cap or many other stocks?This stock is constantly giving investors opportunity! And there's lots heating up here and developments are always lurking around the corner

2908 2018-04-03 03:08:30 I am an American and although I am a gun owner I DON'T think bump stocks becoming illegal is an attack on my rights. Your views may be supported by many but you are just playing politics like our stupid El Presidente.

2915 2018-04-03 03:05:27 I don't worry for anyone with money in stocks. I worry for the millions who pay the steepest price when the banksters' bubble bursts. That's the sick irony of the neoliberal economy. A booming stock market doesn't help 90%, but they suffer most when it implodes.

#Nifty opening gap down 60-70 points doesnt warrant opening shorts. I am not too concerned. Only breakout above 10260 will warrant longs. So, another day of cautious stance is required. Holding wicket is more important.

2924 2018-04-03 03:00:59 What’s interesting is that may coincide with very weak overall equity returns too. Would be interested to see past periods with low turnover in top ten stocks over a decade and if that correlates with overall market absolute returns.
2925 2018-04-03 02:59:50 Tell me why I had a 40 minute discussion with my world history teacher about stocks and I’m still high key confuswd
2926 2018-04-03 02:59:30 Sadly, I suspect Trump or his cronies short stocks (Amazon) or the market, knowing Trump will tweet about a stock or tariffs the next day. Do you doubt that could be true?
2927 2018-04-03 02:59:19 And you do understand I was brought to this Twitter page because the owner of said page felt the need to retweet one of my random tweets that had nothing to do with him.  I just was wondering if people who shorted Amazon stocks were making money today.
2928 2018-04-03 02:59:06 They should focus on providing the stocks of redmi note 5 pro
2929 2018-04-03 02:58:43 ok let me have some stocks too
2930 2018-04-03 02:57:01 You're the fucking joke. I see the stocks went down again today, great job. Keep it up Captain Bone Spurs and China and Russia will be out new leaders in now time. They already own you, so why not the rest of the country right?
2931 2018-04-03 02:56:52 Yep. I tweeted the same thing last week. Someone has shorted theses stocks!
2932 2018-04-03 02:56:24 also the morons that believe the TD Ameritrade ads telling them they they should be dabbling in stocks and options  =P
2933 2018-04-03 02:56:04 So why are stocks falling? Huh?

2945 2018-04-03 02:47:28 So called #FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google - have been largely responsible for a multi-year bull run in world shares, although the threat of government regulation has raised worries about their outlook.
2946 2018-04-03 02:46:50 What he's done with Amazon he should be in jail now. First it's a personal vendetta against the owner. Then stocks drop bc of him and his buddies buy in at a lower price. Then the Sinclair dictorship in the local media. Made them all say the same thing. Get DT out.

2960 2018-04-03 02:39:38 Some staples stocks could remain out of favor as leveraged balance sheets plus weak net income growth and low dividend coverage could lead to stagnant dividends or possibly even dividend cuts.  If prices go low enough, maybe the yields will be attractive again!

2963 2018-04-03 02:38:48 All together, the so-called FAANG stocks Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix  and Google which powered major indexes to repeated highs last year, lost $78.7 billion in market value Monday, bringing their declines since the Nasdaq Composite’s March 12 peak to $397 billion
2964 2018-04-03 02:38:26 I imagine Trump and Kush are just shorting stocks and then having Trump bad mouth them on Twitter so their bets pan out.

2967 2018-04-03 02:35:30 I love how investors use Warren Buffett’s name as justification for buying FANG dips at top of market cycle. Being “greedy when others are fearful” doesn’t mean buying overvalued tech stocks before crash. A dip is coming that can’t be bought.

2974 2018-04-03 02:31:52 Don't think I called for an outright ban of weapons... I have called for restricting access through psychological testing as well as mandatory waiting periods. I've also called for banning bump stocks and limiting magazine capacity

3001 2018-04-03 02:18:50 Bump stocks; if you do your research  you will find these devices were actually approved under the Obama administration, not once but twice!
3002 2018-04-03 02:18:26 It is unfortunate for Mr. Warren and many other sport stores in the same situation but if fish stocks are not there than why completely destroy any chance of recovery. The big question is , How did we get here without any warning signs and what caused it ?
3003 2018-04-03 02:18:25 @realDonaldTrump You attack Amazon and stocks tumble. You dont care because you have monsy. 63% of the people who voted for you are watching their 401k's disintegrate. Your ego has lost them their savings. GOP is picking your successor
3004 2018-04-03 02:18:02 @HarkenToArken this gif reminds me of watching the ANA guys taking hammers, shovels, butt stocks, big rocks to IED's in the road to clear them Haha.
3005 2018-04-03 02:17:11 All stocks
3006 2018-04-03 02:16:57 Automatic weapons were banned in about 1934. Bump stocks were made available and legal in 2010, under the Obama administration. Try again.
3007 2018-04-03 02:16:40 Its only been a few months and  almost $2.3tn was erased from all US stocks in Feb and Mar, w/ both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones marking their first quarterly losses in 10 quarters. And where's that health bill you seem to have forgotten? Its only been years in the making ...
3008 2018-04-03 02:16:29 And squashing any economic victory! Kicking Amazon squelching Amazon & other tech stocks, Chinese tariff “reciprocity,” his favorite word, are depressing stock markets. All HIS doing!
3009 2018-04-03 02:15:32 Sure we can. Just add the stick to the ban list. If gun control is done the right way, it will be effective. Banning bump stocks is a good start.

3011 2018-04-03 02:13:56 @Trendy_Wolf what do you recommend for getting in now, Lesley said you're the man! I only have blue chip stocks, wanting to try some penny stocks
3012 2018-04-03 02:13:49 True fact!  It's been forgotten in the media outside of an occasional mention related to bump stocks...  it's the whole reason I got on Twitter as should've been there and a number of my students and friends were hurt/killed.

3024 2018-04-03 02:08:59 Why Trump Stock Market As Acts Like He Owns It When It Global Why GOPs All Praised Trump Their Stocks Within People Voting Power Can Go Ary, When November 6th 2018 Election Around The Corner Why All GOPs Must Be Relying On Russia Vladimir Putin, See If Same Gusto For Them...
3025 2018-04-03 02:08:47 Do you wonder if Trump, Icahn and kushner are short tech stocks through various entities ?  Don't be shocked if that ends up being true.
3026 2018-04-03 02:07:09 You’re never too old till you go cold?
3027 2018-04-03 02:06:29 Let's wait for the poll that's taken after people check their stocks and 401k.
3028 2018-04-03 02:06:05 Would fixing the mess be adding a trillion more dollars to our debt? Having China put tariffs on products that are going to cost Americans more? Stocks are tanking? How is he fixing the mess?

3032 2018-04-03 02:04:34 $BLK by far is the the better project, just in the process of hunting for a few more decent stocks with not so confusing but more focused gold projects and the TA should follow

3043 2018-04-03 02:01:05 @realDonaldTrump stocks have fallen 4% this year, our farmers who sell most of its pork exports to China face $1. Billion in tariffs, our environment & air is becoming dirtier causing more to die - Gee Donnie, I'm do sick of all this winning

3045 2018-04-03 02:00:41 Well now we now why @jack and @Twitter have allowed Trump to continue to spew on his own personal Twitter account - they were afraid of their stocks tanking. History won’t forget. #thenextzuckerberg
3046 2018-04-03 01:59:05 @realDonaldTrump U.S. stocks had their worst April start since 1929. When does the winning start?
3047 2018-04-03 01:59:01 Of course it will I finally have stocks and it will plunge. The story of my life.
3048 2018-04-03 01:58:58 Clearly someone had that magical power because yesterday both Bernie and Trump shit on Amazon, today the stock has fallen 5% and is still going down.  Magic or not it is happening.  People do shit things to short stocks all the time.
3049 2018-04-03 01:57:17 Stocks plunge as trade, tech worries drag prices down
3050 2018-04-03 01:56:24 US money supply growth has fallen to 2.19%, the lowest April reading since 2011. There is now a gaping hole under the stock n property markets. Potential for DJIA 20500-21000 is high #stocks #economy
3051 2018-04-03 01:55:58 Like that trillion$$$ infrastructure bill, cheaper and better healthcare plan, Mexico paying for wall, releasing his taxes, banning bump stocks...
3052 2018-04-03 01:55:03 I think Trump is shorting the stocks that he talks down.  The corruption and theft continues
3053 2018-04-03 01:54:06 I liked the Trump that bragged about the stock market rally last year, than the one which drives stocks down and starts trade wars.  smh
3054 2018-04-03 01:54:05 If you are over 25 and still haven’t put a dime into your retirement, bless your heart. Stop waiting and invest!!!! Whether it’s in your 401k, stocks, bitcoin, bonds, etc.

3060 2018-04-03 01:51:59 Here we are, with a president that bullies a company because he doesn't like the owner, Amazon, stock is down.  He has a bad day and announces a trade war, stocks go down.  I for one, will be buying Amazon stock!  Never in our history have we had a president this corrupt. #stopDT

3063 2018-04-03 01:50:58 I’m that guy, after decades of dinking, that’ll not only ride it out, but buy stocks every 2 weeks in TSP - and in chunks if / when markets continue downward path.

Mr. Batnick nails almost every post.  He and Ben have been pretty big influences on my investing.

Following now 
3064 2018-04-03 01:50:57 I need some help with my stocks
3065 2018-04-03 01:50:53 Trend-following momentum stocks are starting the second quarter the same way they ended the first -- with little momentum.

Momentum] was the strongest part of the market for the last two to three years -- now they’re the weakest part.
3066 2018-04-03 01:50:35 hand grenades are not illegal to own I can make and own one with a FFL 10, also we didn't even ban full automatic weapons either they just have to be pre 1986, they are super expensive and paper work wise not even worth owning which is why bump stocks and ghost triggers were made
3067 2018-04-03 01:48:40 They aren't American because, like any other public company, they transcend nationalism. The stocks in your portfolio aren't concerned with what's best for the US any more than Canadian Oil co's are concerned with what's best for Canada.
3068 2018-04-03 01:48:17 Has anyone used the stockpile app for stocks? I wanted to purchase fraction shares as gifts for family and saw this app advertised. Any idea on if this is legit and safe to use?
3069 2018-04-03 01:47:32 Smart money was always in domestic mid cap stocks
3070 2018-04-03 01:46:17 They are considering banning bump stocks though, which make it more of a rapid-fire situation.
3071 2018-04-03 01:46:13 U.S. stocks are on track to have their worst April start since 1929, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 index slumped 2.4 percent as of 1:10 p.m. in New York, a rout exceeded only by its 2.5 percent decline 89 years ago. #Winning #MAGA #StockMarket #Impeach45
3072 2018-04-03 01:44:49 US stocks are off to its worst Q2 start since the Great Depression. #SUACCS18

3074 2018-04-03 01:44:34 I quit checking my stocks!  It is terrifying. Nothing great about this.
3075 2018-04-03 01:44:12 #RT @DRUDGE_REPORT: Stocks Second Quarter Start is Worst Since Great Depression...
3076 2018-04-03 01:43:51 Shaun, you are such a bandwagon rider.  Politics aside you can’t do it. Did you congratulate Trump when stocks broke new records or only Obama when he had a good run.
3077 2018-04-03 01:43:30 "banning them won't make a difference"  Tell that to the widows and widowers of some of the people shot in Vegas.  Bump stocks made it easier for Stephen Paddock to get off more rounds.
3078 2018-04-03 01:43:23 Where are they finding these people?  Certainly not the ones selling their stocks today!
3079 2018-04-03 01:43:08 April 3, 2018: As of 9:35 a.m., PSEi 7,990.44 down 49.01 points or 0.61 percent. PSEi opened at 7,976.33. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
3080 2018-04-03 01:43:06 breakups are comparable to the stock market crash of October 1929. when one invests everything into stocks, whether that be emotional or monetary, and then it crashes, the Great Depression will follow.
3081 2018-04-03 01:42:25 No, I mean waiting periods, intensive background checks, a national database, and bans on certain types of guns, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
3082 2018-04-03 01:42:25 Trump doesn’t care. He doesn’t own stocks.
3083 2018-04-03 01:41:40 Your stocks don’t reflect that
3084 2018-04-03 01:41:33 You do realize the stock market is taking a nose dive since Trump fired Janet Yellin and finally started his own economic policies.  Stocks are the lowest point in 2018.  

So yeah...keep talking about how his economic policies are so great.
3085 2018-04-03 01:40:15 Trump is the only President I know that when the economy is doing well will sabotage it.  He wanted trade tariffs and is attacking company's like Amazon which hires many people.  Republicans how are your stocks doing?
3086 2018-04-03 01:40:05 Don't think of it as your stocks are down; think of it as a spring cleaning for your portfolio.
3087 2018-04-03 01:39:57 I'm incredibly pissed to be working 12-16 hour days & seeing my tech stocks fall thru the floor bc a moronic insecure MANBABY is whining on Twitter abt his personal vendettas w/China & AMZN & @GOP criminals do nothing. It's time for:
1. class action suit
2. vote the assholes out!

3091 2018-04-03 01:37:06 I’m pondering if Trump isn’t the Moron everyone thinks he is and that someone is making big money shorting the stocks he attacks.
3092 2018-04-03 01:36:46 Im sure #dotard friends are buying bunch of stocks now !!
3093 2018-04-03 01:36:18 Maybe responsible gun owners want bump stocks, or would be more effective with more than 10 bullets to deter a shooter
3094 2018-04-03 01:36:16 はええ
3095 2018-04-03 01:36:15 uh yes considering I started investing in stocks, it's good to be in the know 
3096 2018-04-03 01:35:08 How can it be OK for prez to badmouth companies and/or affect their business/stocks? Especially when he has personal reason for doing so....

3098 2018-04-03 01:33:57 We could feed algae to the krill to replenish the stocks, which would replenish our fish stocks, and take the carbon out, all at the same time.

3103 2018-04-03 01:31:21 At the March for life...  A blonde hair girl said that during her speech.  She mentioned the ban against bump stocks and then said give us an inch we will take a mile.  That is not a quote but something like that.

3106 2018-04-03 01:29:50 We're angry at Trump crashing the stock market, and a particular set of stocks, because he doesn't like the reporting. Thats dictatorish

We're angry at Amazon for continuing to allow a propaganda network. Thats fuckwitted.

Both can be true
3107 2018-04-03 01:29:39 Many years ago I wrote a feature story for Guns & Ammo on black powder rifles.  Actually the article covered 3 gun-makers. One who fashioned stocks, one who precision bored competitive rifles and the old-timer with his black powder
3108 2018-04-03 01:29:30 In all seriousness this is actually true.  My Tesla stocks keep tanking!
3109 2018-04-03 01:29:26 Hey dumb Dump. Stocks are down 458 points. Keep running your mouth how you’re making things  great again.  Stupid fucker
3110 2018-04-03 01:29:15 Stocks are the only thing people don’t like to buy on sale!
3111 2018-04-03 01:28:43 What this really does is give deep pockets a shot at buying low and selling high. Also brutal truth is most stocks are way over priced right now.  And yes, um a shareholder.
3112 2018-04-03 01:28:40 Is Trump doing this to push down the price of Amazon's stocks? Then once they hit a low point. Trump intends to buy up as much Amazon stock as possible. From the money he can take out of his companies. Then turn around and ease up on Amazon so the stocks he just bought go up?
3113 2018-04-03 01:27:42 $HMNY So typical of these overly hyped stocks after it's obvious to the whole world that it's toast; everyone just gets quiet. Just terrible
3114 2018-04-03 01:27:24 But we are the Crypto GEN.... Stocks are dead- wait for it this summer... Its coming :) The book will make good fire kindling :)
3115 2018-04-03 01:26:51 Registering the guns is a step towards federal over reach and seizure when Democrats get control and want to seize them.

Banning high capacity mags won't stop anything, it's like banning bump stocks. Nothing.
3116 2018-04-03 01:26:48 Perhaps Health Insurance company lobbyists have also asked Trump to attack Bezos. Remember when insurance companies' stocks tanked upon learning Amazon & Berkshire Hathaway were considering developing self insurance health care plans.
3117 2018-04-03 01:26:31 Yea.... I like everything you’ve recommended except stocks and this damn crypto. I think I’ll follow the rich dad knowledge n get some rental property and I’ll stick to precious metal for now
3118 2018-04-03 01:26:25 One of these day Trump is going to tweet something that will have stocks dropping like lead balloons. If he tanks the economy we'll all know who to blame no matter hard he tries to wiggle out of it and shift the blame to someone else.
3119 2018-04-03 01:24:50 Facebook stocks would suggest,  people are starting to care.

3123 2018-04-03 01:22:49 The tech-heavy NASDAQ is now down 0.5% year to date – but losses were broad-based, with all sectors in the S&P 500 and 28 of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending lower.
3124 2018-04-03 01:22:43 US stocks slumped on Monday, led by the techs in the wake of further incendiary tweets about Amazon the US president and as confidence took a hit from retaliatory tariffs imposed by China.
3125 2018-04-03 01:22:16 Think Trump & company are short selling stocks?
3126 2018-04-03 01:20:56 Yes, I would think he would manipulate the market to benefit his friends who would dive in to grab large blocks of depressed stocks.
3127 2018-04-03 01:20:46 He HAS to be manipulating stocks for friends (and for himself).

3132 2018-04-03 01:18:51 Technology sell-off continues as investors apply a higher risk premium to technology shares due to data collection/privacy issues. Earnings season maybe less important in the short-term but will lead stock specific moves within this volatility. #stocks #investing #equity

3135 2018-04-03 01:18:08 Took some losses on a few big board stocks today, OTC positions made up for those losses.
3136 2018-04-03 01:17:17 What’s the DC Examiner’s circulation? And how’s your rating after you sent stocks tumbling today, Donnie?
3137 2018-04-03 01:17:09 Why? It all goes to the wealthy who are currently using it to buy back their own stocks, give CEO's giant bonuses and pay severance packages to terminate employees. Important stuff 
3138 2018-04-03 01:15:52 so when is this rotation from bonds to stocks going to happen Chairman?

3141 2018-04-03 01:15:07 @IIMaximusII are you talking stocks or options?
3142 2018-04-03 01:14:44 That’s actually one of the few good things that Trump does.   It Affords  buying opportunities on oversold stocks.   I wish there was a way to sell Donald Trump short!
3143 2018-04-03 01:14:28 Losers The Ingram Angle not going anywhere! Just watch when the advertisers find their stocks being sold off and products boycotted by a real demographic! Fox News Rocks!
3144 2018-04-03 01:14:26 gee, 1929 and stocks... 1973 and republicans leaving office.

Looks like trump is really trying to make his mark in US history by combining two of our worst periods.  So much winning...
3145 2018-04-03 01:13:58 You're a jerk! He did what any journalist would do: Ask a question to the president. He DID NOT yell. Have you ever heard of speaking clearly?? 
~ he esp did nothing wrong after Trump yacked to 4yo few mins re: stocks & what not.
3146 2018-04-03 01:13:09 Not losing $, fake stats. P.O. will double check their rates.

3148 2018-04-03 01:12:36 The tax cut was a transfer of wealth from future taxpayers to current shareholders. Gov debt must be serviced. So if you’re an older American owning stocks (like Trump and friends) party on. If you’re not dying soon, vote Democrat in 2018.

3150 2018-04-03 01:11:58 U.S. stocks had their worst April start since 1929. The S&P 500 index slumped 2.2 percent, a rout exceeded only by its 2.5 percent decline 89 years ago, a prelude to the devastating crash later that year that brought on the Great Depression.
3151 2018-04-03 01:11:50 Are we sure he and his cronies aren't shortselling stocks for a quick buck???
3152 2018-04-03 01:10:52 Only a sucker would invest their hard-earned money into the stock market right now. Maybe to short a few stocks, yeah. But there's a correction coming (started?) and it's gonna get ugly. #PullOut

3155 2018-04-03 01:08:19 Military grade weapons have no place in the hands of anyone other than the military and law enforcement. You can’t own and drive a tank up Main Street~owning semi automatic weapons which are easily converted into automatic via bump stocks, is equally as insane.
3156 2018-04-03 01:08:15 I don’t understand why parents ask their small children if they are okay with a huge life changing decisions such as having another child. Why not ask them what stocks to invest in too?  #TeenMomOG

3161 2018-04-03 01:03:39 Come on @pbay08, you are doing the same thing that people do to $FAT.  1.20 - to where we are now.  I'm a shareholder of both so I'm not bashing.  Just because you don't like something doesn't mean it's crap.  Instinet has ruined stocks everywhere.  Block chain will be big.....
3162 2018-04-03 01:03:34 Thank you for the RT on the top 15 Sales Q/Q #stocks @AntonioGlvez9 $FSCT maybe putting a bottom in, it is really fighting its 50 day. Have a great week.

3164 2018-04-03 01:01:33 Not so fast. Call on the spx was based on rates going higher and stocks crumbling from that. Yet we’re at 2.74% for the 10 yr , not what Gundlach predicted
3165 2018-04-03 01:01:16 Also, if and when democrats take control I have a strong feeling I'm going to regret voting for him because his position on the 2nd amendment isn't as strong as he claimed.  He wants to raise the age, ban bump stocks, I think you'll see a massive overhaul soon.
3166 2018-04-03 01:00:51 Thanks for the like and RT of the top 15 Sales Q/Q #stocks @ioTrader $VNOM maybe working on a cup pattern. Have a super week

3168 2018-04-03 01:00:29 Apparently stocks start the second quarter off at lowest since Great Depression? Is the right? That sounds bad.
3169 2018-04-03 01:00:01 I did not know that wall streeters are short selling stocks based on prior knowledge  of trump's attacks on a company.  That has to be illegal.  #inners
3170 2018-04-03 00:59:52 What are you doing with the stocks they are bad
3171 2018-04-03 00:59:20 Feel free to seek analysis of stocks anytime, just write the full name of the company and tweet it or send direct message
3172 2018-04-03 00:59:12 And yet our stocks and retiremen5 funds plummet
3173 2018-04-03 00:58:57 Slowdown in stocks or the economy? Stocks led the economy. Economy is only heating up now but stocks have anticipated it for years....hence the crazy high valuations.

3176 2018-04-03 00:56:53 Who's buying out all the stocks when they become very low in value, and why aren't you?
3177 2018-04-03 00:56:39 Fishing quotas protect fish stocks and are not set by EU. We will still need an agreement to preserve fish stocks.
3178 2018-04-03 00:56:30 He's tanking the company's stocks. I wonder how long before the lawsuits start pouring down

3181 2018-04-03 00:55:05 It wouldn't shock me if he told his people short Amazon stocks before he did this so that they make money.
3182 2018-04-03 00:54:44 He made more than what he makes in stocks
3183 2018-04-03 00:53:58 They're morons. They pull that crap, then they can't understand when their stocks suddenly tank. The NFL was shocked when their rating crashed after the Kaepernick fiasco. Goes to show how disconnected they are from public perception.

3192 2018-04-03 00:49:43 Does anyone know if #Trump takes a short position on the stocks of companies that he then shit-tweets?
3193 2018-04-03 00:49:04 A valuable tip for stock investors, don't buy bump stocks, bad investment, don't think about making a killing, think about making money, just a tip.
3194 2018-04-03 00:48:59 Stocks:All 30 Dow index components said to have fallen below key technical levels. Is the Feb low support like a dam made of sand?
3195 2018-04-03 00:48:49 I think pessimism is justified both in the long term on account of deficits and short term on account of the trade war. But using the stock market to assess the tax bill is silly. Dip is caused by trade concerns and (finally) re-evaluating overvalued tech/startup stocks
3196 2018-04-03 00:48:48 Fogot to metion stocks went up 8k points since Nov 2016
3197 2018-04-03 00:48:18 AMZN is up for the year!  If you have this much stress I suggest you not invest in stocks.

3203 2018-04-03 00:44:50 STOCKS: From 2007 to 2009 stocks dropped 55% from 14,000 to 6,500.  It took SIX YEARS to recover.  And Obama was good at turning economy around. 
You may want to reduce your stocks holdings. There is $7 BILLION/DAY, TRADE WARS, & idiot for a president.
@TheDemocrats @DNC
3204 2018-04-03 00:44:26 Stocks plunged again across the board today.  Bet that approval rating sank along with it.
3205 2018-04-03 00:44:06 Buying stocks for children should really be more of a thing.
3206 2018-04-03 00:43:37 #Fmystocks Don't have stocks, so no stock stories.
3207 2018-04-03 00:43:24 With ending stocks at lowest level in history upside is considerable. But the the biggest gains may take place with longs in oats and shorts in other grains and in particular Chicago wheat
3208 2018-04-03 00:43:21 Also, Amazon isn’t just any stock. It’s a tech leader so influential they created an acronym for that small group of the most influential stocks on the Nasdaq: FANG. The “A” is Amazon.
3209 2018-04-03 00:42:39 You go high, stocks go low
3210 2018-04-03 00:42:18 Another day where Trump directly influences the drop in the stock market. It seems so quiet in the WH when the market goes down but so loud when stocks were up.  He can’t have it only one way.  #StockMarket

3214 2018-04-03 00:41:00 So if your friend was putting money into a "stocks and bonds" pyramid scheme / MLM, would you say anything to him? He keeps parroting "The market is really good right now" when it's..... super not.....
3215 2018-04-03 00:40:36 And those people who happen to own Amazon stocks!
3216 2018-04-03 00:40:35 Well, if he knocks their stocks down enough - I'm sure a lot of his friends will benefit from buying them up.

3222 2018-04-03 00:37:25 It just gets worse and worse.... Oh, and I bet someone in his circle is shorting stocks...
3223 2018-04-03 00:37:24 I don’t think he knows what he’s doing.  Or is it possible this is a way to shift wealth ? Push stocks down so they are buying opportunities ? No he’s just incompetent
3224 2018-04-03 00:36:54 I’d like to see #Trump heavily in stocks at his age, at #GuantanamoBay, by the time #Mueller’s investigation comes to its conclusion. The penalty for #traitor of our Republic is death, so #POTUS would be getting off lightly. Christ was humble & compassionate; Trump isn’t. #Resist

3226 2018-04-03 00:36:01 Want to be a millionaire?
You must work and save and invest in shares or stocks and start a 401k best to start young and keep putting away monies, you will run into hard times yet you must keep your eye on the millionaire you got this
3227 2018-04-03 00:35:56 Oh, the winning, the winning! Tech stocks tank after Trump's twitter storm. Edu cuts so successful, teachers in 2 states walk out. No one wants to work in WH. Food  costs/interest, up. Recession on horizon? And, we're about to lose 700k best/brightest. Stop w/all the winning!
3228 2018-04-03 00:35:46 I think ultimately you were smart to move your funds out of stocks just before the election. It's going to be a bumpy ride. Though when they drop a lot more it might be time to buy back in.
3229 2018-04-03 00:35:43 ALL of my stocks have suffered significant losses  since Trumf begain his reign.  His tariff war will continue to damage stocks and markets, hurt farmers and blue collar workers.
Tariff wars are impossible to win. We lose.
Thanks 45.
3230 2018-04-03 00:35:39 Sounds like a good opportunity to buy stocks
3231 2018-04-03 00:34:54 @Why_Not_Trump Are you going to take credit for stocks making their worst start to a second quarter since the Great Depression in 1929.  Just asking since you took credit for rise in stocks when it’s on the rise.
3232 2018-04-03 00:34:39 You should be sued by every person that hold amazon stocks.
3233 2018-04-03 00:32:39 I disagree.  A well coordinated attack on individual stocks along with a colluding vast networked media could drive prices down and then a self fulfilling prophecy exists. Fear will feed more fear.
3234 2018-04-03 00:32:29 Stocks could go down more, then swing back up.  Go up some more before they go down again in a few weeks.  All the awhile, Repubs/Dems pick and choose when and how to use it for/against their biases for/against trump.  And on and on.
3235 2018-04-03 00:32:16 It's officially the worst start to the second quarter of the year for stocks since the Great Depression.

I just can't take all this winning!!

3240 2018-04-03 00:30:17 Attacking a hugely successful American company because he disagrees with his politics? Amazon stocks fell another 5% today on these attacks.
3241 2018-04-03 00:30:16 It's borderline unless he's making money off it somehow, like shorting stocks.

Guaranteed he's making money off it tho.

3243 2018-04-03 00:29:53 Silly to sit there for half of the day watching this crash ensue as we smashed through the 200 sma only whilst not even holding SPY puts (or any pro-growth puts for that matter) or HVU, UVXY, gold stocks, etc. Definitely worth investing in some gold to hedge.
3244 2018-04-03 00:28:42 Unless people are hiding under rocks, they know he lies. Anyone who would make major financial decisions based on HIS word instead of their own research..maybe deserves their stocks to  drop. Of course, everyone else goes along  for the ride.  Buckle up. It's far from over.

3246 2018-04-03 00:26:56 Sell off on wall street caused by the NRA, transferring funds to buy bump stocks, bump stocks are bad for the stock market, bad for America, bad for everyone.
3247 2018-04-03 00:26:37 You can’t get anything done when you hold all branches of the government. You are such a loser. See those stocks today? That’s really winning!
3248 2018-04-03 00:26:29 If Trumpy was not in such a hurry to tear up all of Obama's Executive Orders out of spite we would not have this problem. Now he's welching on the NAFTA agreement, & stocks are falling. Making America Great? NOPE! #TrumpTreason

3251 2018-04-03 00:25:41 US Stocks tumble and Market volatility spikes, not because the market basics change, but the fear of the investor about Trump's next tweet. What new problem he will generate this evening.
3252 2018-04-03 00:25:37 Stocks bottom on news of Shaun King being an imbecile
3253 2018-04-03 00:25:29 Thanks @realDonaldTrump  for giving a tax break that won’t benefit me, making everything more expensive by fighting with the world, tanking my stocks, and how about those gas prices?? Nice job asshole.
3254 2018-04-03 00:25:12 Trump. Stocks lost more in the 2nd quarter of this year than any year since the Great Depression.
3255 2018-04-03 00:25:10 Stocks down, gas prices up..  and it will get worse.  Trump supporters will long for the day when Obama was POTUS, but I doubt they'll ever admit it.
3256 2018-04-03 00:25:05 It has always sounded like to me, that Trump is purposefully trying to game the stock market for himself and friends with stocks. So they can control the lows and highs. It’s not far fetched, it’s entirely plausible.

3264 2018-04-03 00:22:50 Moved a bunch of my IRA investments from stocks to bonds since 11/16.  Sleeping comfortably in current stock-to-bond ratio. 
3265 2018-04-03 00:22:36 I guess I'm not super surprised, but seems notable that bitcoin has been struggling along with stocks this year. They're not exactly correlated, but it certainly hasn't been acting as a diversification/ safe-haven asset.
3266 2018-04-03 00:22:14 Actually stocks were off by a couple hundred More pts, that number is what it looked like at closing, after a rebound of sorts...I really suspect insider trading/stock manipulation by the chimpanzee-in-chief.
3267 2018-04-03 00:22:14 If we knew it, we'd be actually dying to make thousands phone calls to the recordings and other suppliers to secure more stocks by now.  Nothing is confirmed their comeback in Korea but just heard they'll be stay in Japan during this month. woooooo 
3268 2018-04-03 00:22:04 The NRA has caused the selloff on Wall Street, advising NRA members to transfer funds and buy bump stocks, bump stocks are a bad investment, bad for Wall Street.
3269 2018-04-03 00:22:03 Text from a friend! Life as a “normal person” in US these days:
“Just watched the news, EPA, DACA, Russia, Trade wars with China, stocks plummeted, Amazon tweets. Someone get this FUCKER OUT OF THERE!” @realDonaldTrump
3270 2018-04-03 00:22:03 I think everyone has had enough of TrumpTantrums. I wouldn't have money in stocks.. if W could get the market below 7000, you know Trump can beat that.
3271 2018-04-03 00:21:59 Gary Cohn knew what he was doing..this Prez has ONLY the economy and the stock market that reflects/leads that economy (animal spirits v fear induced recession) going for him..he's gone off the rails, if stocks tank he'll tank w them in 2018 and surely 2020 (unless removed prior)
3272 2018-04-03 00:21:58 Neglected to mention attacks on Amazon, effects of metal prices on energy companies, a super bloated budget jacking rates, and the cloud over tech stocks from the Cambridge Analytica revelation (Trump's crooked campaign).
But, yeah, sure, Trump had nothing to do with it.
3273 2018-04-03 00:21:25 He’s allegedly tanking the market right after his friends and family dump certain stocks....
3274 2018-04-03 00:21:22 I voted for the Rolodex bc I learn most from ppl and that option contains the biggest opportunity set outside investing in stocks/bonds.
3275 2018-04-03 00:20:51 Interesting watching the #markets over the past week. Will be interesting to see how this week unfolds after a miserable opening on all fronts yesterday. #Dowjones #Stocks #SP500
3276 2018-04-03 00:20:40 Limit clip/magazine sizes. Ban Bump Stocks and other quick fire modifications.  Stronger laws concerning Gun Ownership and domestic violence. A better system of Mental Health Checks and Balances, Stronger Social Media Monitoring for threats of violence, and leeway to intervene.
3277 2018-04-03 00:19:33 Better be careful. Manipulating stocks is a crime
3278 2018-04-03 00:19:16 Twitter is chock full of market makers that carry no risk, unlike stocks and bonds #volckerrule
3279 2018-04-03 00:19:13 The eels n we r having our own private little comp to see who can lose more games. FUCKING laughing stocks  @TheGHRaiders @NRLRaidersNews
3280 2018-04-03 00:18:23 How are our gun control efforts progressing. Will we be able to outlaw assault weapon, high capacity magazines and bump stocks soon?  Have you returned the NRA contributions yet?  #BetoForTexas #turntexasblue
3281 2018-04-03 00:18:21 He had everything to do with the market being up. The wall street players all puffed up  stocks and didn’t short anything when Trump came into office, knowing that investors would be tricked into thinking ‘trump’ means automatic ‘prosperity’.
3282 2018-04-03 00:17:01 Investing in clear backpack stocks immediately!
3283 2018-04-03 00:16:25 Anyone who looks at stocks knows this is true.

>market is fine

>Facebook does some illegal stuff

>whole tech sector dies
3284 2018-04-03 00:16:01 The Stock Market was doing good till the NRA caused the sellout in their rush to reinvest their assets into bump stocks, bump stocks are not good for Wall Street.
3285 2018-04-03 00:15:51 I work in a bank and i monitor stocks exchange.. i love SNSD since my uni days and i still DO very much stan for them now.. what are their problems with us? Sone is a BIG fandom which consists of working adults, homemakers and students
3286 2018-04-03 00:14:31 Perhaps Trump & family or one of his friends/donors made a killing in the market on Amazon just like his friend Icahn made a killing on Aluminum stocks coinciding with Trump’s announcement.
3287 2018-04-03 00:14:17 And by the end of the day we are loosing more money as stocks keep going down. What an idiot.
3288 2018-04-03 00:14:13 Shouldn’t @realDonaldTrump be held liable for using his power to go after companies and causing stocks to go down??? #Amazon #unethical
3289 2018-04-03 00:14:08 The reason bump stocks aren't banned is because it's a very basic product. You can literally make one with a spring and a normal stock.
3290 2018-04-03 00:13:58 $GE $KMI U got make mistake somewhere these are D worst performers in my long portfolio.  Just hope for some kind of miracle at this time :(  Tried to short them and could not get a bite . #stocks
3291 2018-04-03 00:13:53 She got her own money...we made sure she lives a v caucasian lifestyle...stocks, bonds, trusts, Roth IRA’s...

I’m already scheming! 
3292 2018-04-03 00:13:32 @KellyTheRebel so you suggest stocks over real estate?
3293 2018-04-03 00:12:35 I hate how stocks are reported, that being said I’m curious to see how the summer goes, my intuition says people want a correction so bad they’ll create one and statistically you can argue we’re due.
3294 2018-04-03 00:12:23 So Trump and the GOP did not fund planned parenthood for two years, then give them more money int he omnibus? YES THEY DID! Trump has enacted TWO gun control measures, a ban on bump stocks and the omnibus bill had gun control in it, he signed into law. WAKE THE FUCK UP!
3295 2018-04-03 00:12:18 dump your facebook account and your facebook stocks. they are going to fall down. they sell your personal information. zuccerberg has allready lost billions, do not go down with a sinking ship. facebook is cia.
3296 2018-04-03 00:12:00 phony white uses fearless man and stocks, the mad dexterity brings bitter time
3297 2018-04-03 00:11:59 Trump stole Billions from Bezos today, tanked his stocks, because he hates the WaPo.  Isn't that against the law, shouldn't somebody remind him?  He did it because he can.  Lets show him can't, ok?
3298 2018-04-03 00:11:52 Stocks rising... 
3299 2018-04-03 00:11:08 $KHC thank GOD I sold some OCT 21 call against it above. At least I collect the premium while this and other food / packaging stocks are in the pits. wonder how  lower it goes before @WarrenBuffett & his gang pull out. @MadMoneyOnCNBC @business @SquawkCNBC @SeekingAlpha #stocks
3300 2018-04-03 00:11:08 Been a good day all the stocks I got free from trading went up today. Diversifying.
3301 2018-04-03 00:10:51 H/T to @tweetstar10 he’s been bearish stocks since we were up in the 2700’s S&P.  Problem of it, for me, I couldn’t time the futures right.  Shoulda played options but I missed the down move.  Good thing there will be more moves/trades to come.  This doesn’t feel like it’s over
3302 2018-04-03 00:10:36 You are so full of BS as the young people from Parkland say instead if cursing!  Remember them?  What has happened to action on gun violence? Bump stocks? Possible ban on assault weapons and background checks?  You told Congressmen not to fear the NRA. Turns out yo fear them!!!
3303 2018-04-03 00:10:28 Great job , huh?  Stocks plunged today, trade war with China not great for Am. farmers,  need more? 

Call it great job If you want...Most ppl see and call it different !  

By the way, American Presidents that are loved and respected is because of the great jobs they did...
3304 2018-04-03 00:10:25 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
3305 2018-04-03 00:09:35 Swing trading, while potentially profitable is rather dangerous and stupid for the average investor. TA is only ever SPECULATIVE information about what we GUESS the price will be.
Instead why not #dyor and find good investment options for the long term.
#investor #stocks #btc
3306 2018-04-03 00:08:47 When is Trump going to be held accountable for his abuse of power?  He doesn’t like the owner of Amazon so he launches an attack resulting in the stocks plummeting.  How is this presidential behavior?  He is destroying our country and no one is stopping him. — feeling scared
3307 2018-04-03 00:08:43 Even if stocks rise or fall by 0.01%, there must be some grand reason to explain it.
3308 2018-04-03 00:08:08 $IBM Has a nice dividedn and tons of innovative projects that are coming to frutation ( I mean into money ) in coming years.  Planning to buy some in $140 area hopefully lower if I can get it.  @MadMoneyOnCNBC @business @SquawkCNBC @SeekingAlpha #stocks
3309 2018-04-03 00:08:03 @realDonaldTrump stocks down 4% this year, and everyone blames you. Is this another marching order from Putin? Did you invite him to the White House so he could give you your Order of Lenin? #WorstPresidentEver
3310 2018-04-03 00:06:50 $IQ Holding this into my retirement. This is going nowhere but UP. By the time competition catch up , they will be untoucable and may take market away from $NFLX  This is below IPO price   @MadMoneyOnCNBC @business @SquawkCNBC @SeekingAlpha #stocks
3311 2018-04-03 00:06:30 Hope you are not trading stocks with that math JR
3312 2018-04-03 00:06:22 Asia stocks follow suit to the negative lead from Wall St where trade war fears and continued tech woes saw the Nasdaq turn red YTD and slip into correction territory; Nikkei 225  underperforms as JPY strength drags; ASX 200 (-0.4%), Nikkei 225 (-1.5%), KOSPI (-0.8%)

3314 2018-04-03 00:06:00 The top 3 stocks in the S&P 500 are worth more than all of the Russell 2000 ...
3315 2018-04-03 00:04:48 It was selling sentiment almost all day long.  But I watched the futures price action closely.  It never got panicky today.  And fixed income never got nearly as big up as it did during the February breakdown in stocks.  200dma key, I think there’s still more room lower in S&P
3316 2018-04-03 00:04:48 It is incredible that the president of the United States, @realDonaldTrump, has personally driven down the price of Amazon and other stocks that are widely held in 401Ks. He should think before he speaks...I mean tweets!
3317 2018-04-03 00:04:40 You do know those businesses are now realizing they made a huge mistake
They fell into the trap of teams without jobs and they’re having a reverse boycott buy those of us with jobs and own businesses. We have the $$$ power. Stocks were being sold today

3318 2018-04-03 00:04:13 Aussie stocks set for a softer start on Tuesday following a slump ~2% last night in the US #ausbiz
3319 2018-04-03 00:03:34 $BABA Still waiting for 155 target though if tech sector continues to break down and #China starts acting tough and rough I can see this back in 140 Range . I am waiting for MR DT. Tweets to bring this down @MadMoneyOnCNBC @business @SquawkCNBC @SeekingAlpha #stocks
3320 2018-04-03 00:02:29 I don't get why stocks drop just cause trump said something against amazon, the business is still doing well  #inners
3321 2018-04-03 00:02:22 Tax cuts could be why interest rates are rising, including LIBOR, which could explain stocks going down. So to disconnect tax cuts and stocks going down isn’t necessarily true.
3322 2018-04-03 00:01:56 Stocks are down. 

The wealthy will come for your* money soon.

But it's not like gov't could do less infrastructure maintenance or fund schools any less, so where will it come from? I'm guessing Medicaid.

*the hard-working poor
3323 2018-04-03 00:01:36 It is good news imo, we needed a catalyst to get other sectors, mainly energy, moving;  most bullish, is the #Tesla crash, super bullish for #oil and energy stocks.
3324 2018-04-03 00:01:17 $AGN Looking forward t oearning call.  Assuming all bad news is baked into the stock, we should see a nice run up into the earning and then who knows @MadMoneyOnCNBC @business @SquawkCNBC @SeekingAlpha #stocks
3325 2018-04-03 00:01:07 Presumably the same way banning bump stocks would protect you from a handgun.
3326 2018-04-03 00:00:43 Everyone on CNBC said sell stocks. I’m not sayin, I’m just saying. Naymasayin?
