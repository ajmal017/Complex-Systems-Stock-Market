She needs to divest from medical device companies before she can begin to hold him accountable.

38 2018-06-21 23:42:46 They have been TOLD to support this so they do, blindly. Just like they were TOLD to support tax cut for wealthy that has produced none of its touted economic benefits. No massive new investment- just corporate buy back of stocks & rising inflation & interest rates. Winning!
39 2018-06-21 23:42:44 I don’t see your point. Index funds cycle assets to match index components. A (hypothetical) DJI ETF in 1896 would have tracked both the returns and holdings automatically, to this day. Over 1,000,000% gain in total. If they buy+hold just one of those stocks? Much less, or $0.

50 2018-06-21 23:30:51 If you guys are really attacking @tarabusicreek for selling out fast... you need to grow up. She only stocks product that is pre made so that your wait time is reasonable. Like she’s keeping these restocks small for YOUR sake. Leave her alone
51 2018-06-21 23:30:42 Stocks falling, gas&heating oil costs going up. Soon we'll have to take in elderly family mbrs because medicaid & medicare is being cut. Paul Ryan wants to cut social security. Meanwhile, wealthy love their YUGE tax cuts! Enjoy Trump's military parade while vets are homeless too.
52 2018-06-21 23:29:02 Trump is the worst on name calling.   I see your bio says you live Trumo.  People loved Hitler too and Trump knows exactly what he’s doing.   And you are brainwashed enough to buy into it.   Putting babies in cages is trumps policy.   Your love for Trump says a lot about you!

54 2018-06-21 23:26:53 It just makes me think that stocks as an asset class will become obsolete over time. It's comparatively useless tied up money.
55 2018-06-21 23:26:15 My husband stocks up with two cases each year, they sit in our freezer and he slowly eats them all year long!  Lol Truth be told, he says one case is mine, but I end up with one cookie!
56 2018-06-21 23:26:14 Study your stocks religiously, technically and fundamentally.

Do your homework before entry.

For Stock Option, choose the Expiry Date wisely.
57 2018-06-21 23:26:10 Of the 30 stocks I follow 20 were down today. The other 10, which were up, all marijuana stocks. Ha. THAT is where we are.
58 2018-06-21 23:26:00 Guess who owns the AR’s and bump stocks? Not my side.
59 2018-06-21 23:25:50 I really love IB, the trading workstation is awesome but unfortunately none of the weed stocks are marginable at IB, not even CGC ACB APH OGI :( It sucks because their interest rate is the lowest in the industry
60 2018-06-21 23:22:20 Everyone’s an expert in a bull market. Always make sure to do your own research, invest in what you like. Nobody knows if the market is going up or down. But you can increase your odds of success if you put in the work  #stocks #options
61 2018-06-21 23:21:01 I'm just taking what I use for predicting machine failures and applying to stocks and using the same back testing metrics and performance metrics.  There is some delta between my projected error and actual error when backtesting; but its not off by enough to concern me.
62 2018-06-21 23:19:21 Stocks still trade after the market is closed until 8 pm and stocks trade as early as 4 am before the 930 am open.

66 2018-06-21 23:16:59 When you split up the families then you need to types of accommodations which cost more money so yes private prison stocks Rose
67 2018-06-21 23:15:58 I've followed tech stocks for 4 decades. Several hundred of them. Almost every one eventually shriveled up and went away - obsoleted by others. No company was more dominant than IBM - but it's a shell of its former self. Techs are sometimes good buys, but never "stores of value"
68 2018-06-21 23:15:19 These are the 1 stocks in energy sector that yesterday set all-time highs:

70 2018-06-21 23:14:47 Please he’s not innocent. Stocks in private prisons shot up the day after Trump was inaugurated. Two of Sessions aides go to work lobbying for the prison industry less than one month before Trump was elected.

74 2018-06-21 23:13:16 @AstonClintonSch Hi. Sorry to ask directly, but Aylesbury Foodbank is really struggling with low food stocks currently. Could the school do a school wide collection, just a tin or packet of something each if pupils can?) Conts can be left in the church on right in tubs. Thanks x

76 2018-06-21 23:11:12 I was watching how it was going with citizens. It’s just recently dawned on me that they are practicing in immigrants. It was widely reported that stocks in private prisons show up the day after Trump was inaugurated.

78 2018-06-21 23:08:40 Shares = Dollars / (Entry - Stop) for Longs. That way it's not about margin but about respecting your stops. I personally find margin to be helpful when playing higher priced stocks such as bluechips.
79 2018-06-21 23:08:38 Keep at it @nelsonforsenate.  FL has had enough of @FLGovScott .  FL knows about the Medicare fraud when he was CEO. The tax break he gave to CHS Medical. That after they had already double billed the state. The stocks he owns in private prisons. @marcorubio also in on that.
80 2018-06-21 23:08:30 We need a good haircut to chase away the day traders and when the real stocks come back there will be less sellers and more buyers creating lots of value for the steady hand investors and shorts

84 2018-06-21 23:05:59 Varney is a paid shill. Tax cuts have been good for corporations and those who owned stocks. 5 million of 160 million got one time bonuses. Adelson made more than those bonuses combined. Sure, every little bit helps, but it’s increasing the economic divide in our country.
85 2018-06-21 23:04:14 Does anyone on here invest in stocks?
86 2018-06-21 23:04:01 I hope you people listened to Aunty RiRi when I told you to buy ganja stocks.
87 2018-06-21 23:03:56 We are in the Tech Bubble 2.0. $AAPL $MSFT $FB $GOOG all at ATH's. Guess what...blockchain is tech too. I can't see how tech stocks are on fire and blockchain remaining bearish for too much longer. Market cap of $AAPL is >300% of *all crypto combined*
88 2018-06-21 23:03:41 Lol, I don’t know what stocks you have but mine are sweet. Might want to talk to your stock person.
89 2018-06-21 23:03:02 @RobinhoodApp I dont understand why other site let those of us in Oklahoma invest in cryptocurrency but you site doesnt. Why is that, and pot stocks.
90 2018-06-21 23:02:59 They are the same folks who have always built prison and the incestuous relationship between wall street and these folks to finance prison and offer the stocks to their friends is well known..And the only way is  jail lots of poor folks and people of color..
91 2018-06-21 23:02:53 Buy stocks, not what covers ya socks kid!
92 2018-06-21 23:02:26 Funny you and your buddies the democrats never did anything about prescription cost . The Clinton’s and others made a fortune off of Pharmaceutical stocks .

thanks! Millie
96 2018-06-21 22:58:23 @MadMoneyOnCNBC Suggestion , everyone gives their stock names but I don't hear people like Betsy from Cal. give an analysis of why she took the stocks. She just wanted to hear herself talk. If she hadn't taken twice as long as everyone else u could have heard 1 more person.
97 2018-06-21 22:57:44 My group chat is about stocks and bonds, while your man crush and his boys talking about how he gone pass you off to the team.
98 2018-06-21 22:56:59 US funds already redundant if optimizing across individual stocks. Sounded more crabby than intended. But ... maybe look at kewei Hou and Lou Zhang paper on 300 factors if you haven’t already.
99 2018-06-21 22:56:35 Collins has stocks in for profit prisons and makes money for every head in a bed. Drumming up business, SusieQ? Currying favor, SusieQ?

101 2018-06-21 22:55:12 You're right. Timing is everything. Yet with the market so very low, all the advice was 'don't invest.' Having started investing in the '60s, this flew in the face of all I had ever learned. Cdn. bank stocks were in the $20s and $30s & reporters didn't even consider buying stock.

103 2018-06-21 22:54:37 about 10% of them are inactive, I'll admit.  There are in fact 34,000 tickers (including mutual funds) you can invest in.  approximately 6,000 us based stocks and 28,000 mutual funds globally.
104 2018-06-21 22:54:15 Cannabis stocks drift back from early highs
Yes. Yes. Very clever.
105 2018-06-21 22:51:37 Is that why it’s been stated that Nintendo literally can’t die as a company because of they’re large sums of money and Sony had dropped in stocks and is constantly on the verge of shutting down their film studio
106 2018-06-21 22:51:32 Bahahaha - keep an eye on your portfolio-stocks are FALLING! Trump won't stop until he's ruined us economically & morally.

109 2018-06-21 22:49:48 Initial projections after optimizing my forecasts looks like I can forecast 34,000 stocks in less than 6 hours.  I can probably optimize this down to 15 minutes; but my wallet isn't big enough for that...
110 2018-06-21 22:47:27 With the Dow down 8 consec days it’s easy to be uneasy but the sell off so far has been more a slow grind lower than traders puking up stocks. Once we can turn a  focus from tariffs to earnings the bulls can get back on track. Expect a couple more pullbacks and for them to be bot
111 2018-06-21 22:47:03 Ant Stocks Under Pressure From Trump's Trade Tactics, ETF Posts Worst Losing Streak in Six Years
112 2018-06-21 22:46:49 Like many of you, I thought I was done with #uranium #stocks buying during this waiting period for #U3O8 price to rally. Instead, I'm taking profits on other stocks as TSX hits record territory, raising cash to take advantage of any further month-end #uranium stocks weakness.
113 2018-06-21 22:45:34 Wages are not exploding and the economy only growing at 2.3%. This is lower than Obama economy. Companies still leaving. Very little of tax money reached to workers as companies pay bonuses and by back stocks. Scalise you are a lier and know it.
114 2018-06-21 22:45:20 These are the 12 stocks in finance sector that yesterday hit all-time highs:

115 2018-06-21 22:44:56 NEWS FLASH!
These types of companies knew this since Jan 2017, check the records of the stocks before and after this ILLIGITIMATE election!
Hmm, maybe their should be some insider trading investigated by FCC, too?
Also, check whom are the people in CONgress who are profiting, too
116 2018-06-21 22:43:28 Look at USD/JPY at 6am EST when the New York trading desk switch on their algos and ramp the USD. The only stocks holding up are 5 FANG stocks... everything else is selling off on deflationary fears. It’s going to be bad.
117 2018-06-21 22:42:23 When stocks breakout of a trendline they can/tend to backtest the breakout point to validate the move...at that point buyers jump in..doesn’t have to test but most do....GL hope that helps
118 2018-06-21 22:42:19 See what today brings, support in the spec stocks could mean we're back in business ready for a big July. Tax selling might nearly be over, let's hope.
119 2018-06-21 22:41:09 Simmering tensions between #US & #China on trade have kept stocks under pressure with #Trumpadministration threatening to slap tariffs on $200 billion worth in Chinese goods. China said this thread violates previous negotiations and consensus reached between both countries.
120 2018-06-21 22:40:29 Wall Street owns Congress and these for-profit corporations which run these detention centers (mostly in Texas) just had their stocks skyrocket--so both Democrats and Republicans will do whatever Wall Street says to keep dividends high. At the expense of all of us.

125 2018-06-21 22:38:18 No, we won't. Your stocks have fallen like a rock. Enjoy less dividends.
126 2018-06-21 22:37:03 Every day heroin dealers get arrested and their stocks seized. This leaves their families destitute with no means to provide for their vulnerable children. This senseless and inhumane behavior is an outrage and must end. The barbaric police and law enforcement are to blame.

128 2018-06-21 22:35:30 I started trading penny stocks in the 90s. I’ve been watching candlestick patterns for 20+ years. There is no current TA that shows $1k unless it’s taking a LOT of liberty. Anything that high is pure speculation. That kind of investing is for tech enthusiasts who don’t mind risk.
129 2018-06-21 22:34:02 Today was a mini rug pull on 5m chart. Didnt see this comming at all w stocks up over night. Really pissed me off we like to pick and choose when to be scared of geopolitical
130 2018-06-21 22:33:44 EMs outflows into US. FAANG stocks inflows.....weird week as the dollar index has distorted much of the EMs markets currencies squeezing return in local EMs currencies from foreign funds
131 2018-06-21 22:33:31 Well @SenSanders was unemployed till he was 37 so as a dirty bottle collector he would know
132 2018-06-21 22:33:13 The Greed Industry of the Republican Party is despicable;private prison stocks soared the day the racist Jeff Sessions was wrongly appointed as AG;the manipulator & liar McConnell silenced Warren's objections to this evil segregationist.
133 2018-06-21 22:32:21 Anime Expo is soon. I'm ready for the disappointment on finding zero Aikatsu merch while everyone stocks only Love Live :(
134 2018-06-21 22:31:42 Yes to the extent that foreign investors buy dollars expecting further strength... they need to put those dollars to work, likely in stocks or bonds or both.
135 2018-06-21 22:30:53 If you want to prevent another crisis, end the legalized pump and dump ie lending cheap money to banks who lend it to big business who use said borrowed cash to buy back their own stocks (a scam legalized by Reagan btw) that artificially inflate  the stock market.
136 2018-06-21 22:30:45 Great earnings report so lets sell on open. I like how we randomly care abt geopolitical and it really shldnt be hurting tech stocks bcs tarrifs are mostly on commodities.
137 2018-06-21 22:30:32 MY GROCERY STORE NOW STOCKS HALO TOP AND THEY HAVE BIRTHDAY FLAVOUR THIS IS NOT A DRILL
138 2018-06-21 22:29:53 Who’s good with stocks???
139 2018-06-21 22:29:44 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
140 2018-06-21 22:29:39 You are so easily trolled

142 2018-06-21 22:29:16 Let Newfoundlander's manage fish stocks like they fish the food fishery there'll be no fish left in the ocean.
143 2018-06-21 22:29:15 Those stocks aren't soaring, they are down 14% from a year ago. That's a whopper of a lie even for you Mr. Reich.
144 2018-06-21 22:29:02 Wondering is administration insiders loaded up on prison stocks before the policy on migrants went into effect. It would have been the “smart” thing to do.
145 2018-06-21 22:28:19 The amount of FGA allowed by CHI at that percentage is not too great. Not much room to go lower, but hard pressed to buy stocks in that Sky defense. Going to be a clamber to move up the defensive ranks.
146 2018-06-21 22:28:10 @Eric2Raider where do you see junior mining stocks on TSX Venture going in 2018?
147 2018-06-21 22:26:42 The whole  point of the stat is the next six months....  when X occurs at this point in the year, stocks finish the year positive.  It is roughly six months to year end.  Have a great evening. - CC
148 2018-06-21 22:24:58 1 % is in individual stocks ie NRZ
149 2018-06-21 22:20:21 to see a few stocks down isn't unusual, they will bounce back. much bigger importance is possible impact on small business (especially paperwork).
150 2018-06-21 22:20:14 Chinese stocks ripped ass today lmao shoutouts to $HUYA and $IQ
151 2018-06-21 22:19:11 Susquehanna on CCL: `We continue to recommend CCL's shares, and cruise stocks more broadly, as our pricing data suggests trends remain solid through the end of the year, and 1H19 is poised to benefit from easier hurricane-related compares.'
152 2018-06-21 22:19:01 TDJ, why Jesus put the evil spirits, into the neighbors live stocks, resulting in they all rush to the sea and were drown.  The owners of the cattles lost money, and were angry; pounced and ask Jesus to get out of their province.  To intelligent people that is not a coherent act
153 2018-06-21 22:18:53 Yep rich are richer and cat food futures way up with social security cuts. Private prison stocks up thanks to Trumpvilles. Flint has poison water and Puerto Rico has no power. Nazi flags and white sheets also experience booms. Yep Trumpenomics pure voodoo
154 2018-06-21 22:18:50 Tomorrow optionex may be the day MMs scew the shorts. Loaded and holding ton of $YINN. $BRZU and few other stocks.... buy low sell high
155 2018-06-21 22:18:36 Trying to figure out if trading stocks would be a good decision

159 2018-06-21 22:13:31 POTUS opposes Bernie's bill to allow importation of prescription drugs from Canada and elsewhere. He said he wants to keep our prices high and raise everyone else's prices to match. That's why big pharma stocks skyrocketed after his speech
160 2018-06-21 22:13:25 Stocks close slightly slower, trimming earlier losses
161 2018-06-21 22:12:21 The best thing @vechainofficial could add to their upcoming wallet, apart from @LedgerHQ Nano S support, would be the ability to instantly convert earned Thor Power to VET, thus enabling a compound interest effect.

162 2018-06-21 22:11:54 Economy recovered, unemployment dropped, stocks reached record highs.   Trump inherited a growing economy and  now he's wrecking it.
163 2018-06-21 22:10:40 @jimcramer - How come United Rentals never has a P/E much more than 10? Why can't it have a P/E of 16 or 20ish like normal people? 
(after all … stocks are people too)
164 2018-06-21 22:10:21 Dont trust banks bankers stocks or bonds & dont  invest!!!!
165 2018-06-21 22:10:17 Still with the constant “the media won’t cover this” refrain? On the media, all the time? Regardless, everybody who earns most of their money through stocks is going to be fine under the Trump plan.  Anybody who gets paid a wage and uses that to survive is kind of screwed.
166 2018-06-21 22:08:40 Good decision. Makes no sense to pay 0,7% for something that is so easy to front run & that buys & sells in such a clumbsy fashion. It actually makes sense for URA to limit small caps so as to make less unforced errors on the spreads in illiquid stocks. Large caps more forgiving.

On totally different matter, I was hoping to hear your thoughts on a startup concept I'm working on in the world of fantasy sports and sport 'stocks'. Let me know if that's cool and if you'd prefer to go private.

170 2018-06-21 22:04:24 Stocks are being buoyed by company buybacks and dividends. With firms like Apple and others pumping 1 Trillion to buy their own stock and increase dividends, it keeps the value up while doing nothing for the companies long term investment.

173 2018-06-21 21:58:25 Truth of the matter is that we should have been paying these taxes all along. Not sure how we got away with it anyway. Look at the retail stocks today compared to the internet stocks. Retail "UP" Internet "Down"
174 2018-06-21 21:57:45 If Corp America is short $4.8T in USD (& there's a big refi slug coming for all that debt from 2019-2022), then capital structure 101 tells me bondholders are gonna own a much bigger slug of companies, which ain't good for US stocks (which ain't good for US tax receipts)
175 2018-06-21 21:56:48 Hi Aaron, this is strange as I have just checked our stocks and it appears they do still stock the tofoo co naked tofu. the next delivery will be Saturday at 10:00. Thanks - Aiden

177 2018-06-21 21:53:45 Well said, Jeffrey.  I am a bit older, and can recall that in Gymnasium, we were taught only most basic investing (how to buy stocks).  My daughter's curriculum (now in her twenties) did not even include that.  Prepare us only to be good little cogs in the corporate machine.
178 2018-06-21 21:53:23 I'm not 9

184 2018-06-21 21:49:43 I worked in Stocks and Bonds when I was in my 20's, I watched more than one woman throw herself at rich men even if they were married.  Not everything is the man's fault, other than they can also say no and some did.
185 2018-06-21 21:49:39 also, while it's a terrible metric for the economy, it's -- I don't know about good, but far less terrible -- metric of the consequences of the tariff. if it's bad for business, it's bad for stocks

194 2018-06-21 21:46:29 It’s amazing how many times I’ve seen you tweet about the fall of stocks/stock-market...never about its rise. Sad.
195 2018-06-21 21:44:49 Shorting stocks is one way to keep stocks from becoming overvalued...which they all are today. How is Tesla a $20B co. despite never turning a profit? It’s a ludicrous valuation based on a showman’s promises.
196 2018-06-21 21:44:04 But Fox news keeps telling em economy is booming! Have to repeat it to sound smart, informed -like they have any fucking clue what they're talking about. Too bad they dont fucking understand that normal ppl like us ARENT THE ONES BUYING/SELLING STOCKS. The stupidity is too much.
197 2018-06-21 21:42:53 Trade Concerns Hammer Global Auto Stocks
Auto stocks were pummeled after Daimler issued a profit warning that it blamed on U.S.-China trade tensions. Daimler said Chinese retaliatory import duties on cars built in the U.S. would hurt sales
198 2018-06-21 21:40:39 Agreed so they can be deported together.
199 2018-06-21 21:40:39 I think we pretty much know what Dems think. They think taxpayers are idiots, we need to dump capitalism and replace it with socialism, that we need open borders, a massive welfare state, and should worship government as our Lord and Savior. What else is there to know?

202 2018-06-21 21:39:20 Keep on dreaming
203 2018-06-21 21:38:36 Exactly. Stocks are overpriced, bonds are enormous bubble, bitcoin  is too raw yet to take it seriously. Gold is not supposed to be an investment but only store value thing. 
Of course you can cherry pick nice stocks but in general what’s the good play now?
204 2018-06-21 21:38:17 Not sure if you're aware, as you probably only short stocks, but shareholders are the owners of the company.
205 2018-06-21 21:38:16 Watching CNBC now is similar to 2000 and 2007. Stocks NEVER go down in that world

210 2018-06-21 21:36:38 Wait until the trade war really kicks in with China, then the stocks will go south with wage growth whilst the unemployment goes north. The Russians did more harm to ISIS in 2 weeks than the US did in 5 years. And Korea, if you trust either of those 2 fucktards you are delusional

231 2018-06-21 21:25:08 I reckon she is accurate on this occassion, as both Johnson and the idea of ‘Global Britain’ are international laughing-stocks.
232 2018-06-21 21:24:48 Cramer 2008. Don’t own stocks for 5 years
233 2018-06-21 21:23:27 It's good business if you have stocks in private prisons.
234 2018-06-21 21:22:57 First many buy gold as insurance, I like the miners and sell calls periodically, but over the long term perhaps the last 15 years the correlation between gold and stocks has been really tight though not on a daily or weekly basis.
235 2018-06-21 21:22:55 Yes and more hedge funds than US stocks
236 2018-06-21 21:22:21 That’s a great point!! I like the way you are thinking 
237 2018-06-21 21:21:39 Damn that's fucked up man. At least they didn't stab you though
238 2018-06-21 21:20:56 I find it incredibly unethical that there is a deliberate slant on the information from some shorts and writers.   If you're short $HMNY,  at least be honest and tell the entire story. It's irrelevant if shorts end up being right or wrong. Just be honest.
239 2018-06-21 21:20:37 Yes!  What ever happened to his ban on bump stocks????
240 2018-06-21 21:20:04 Do they really own stocks when they say they are selling and buying
241 2018-06-21 21:19:15 There's an entire generation of investors who basically only trade 10 tech stocks. Let that sink in.

258 2018-06-21 21:12:54 If we are interested in saving lives why are we not as passionate about banning alcohol as we are about banning bump stocks and assault riffles?  Many. many more lives are lost to alcohol.  Are we being logical or emotion driven?

260 2018-06-21 21:12:08 VERY astute @GuyAdami. In 2008/09 the market tanked LONG before the economy did. When ppl stop chasing Netflix and Amazon and Bitcoin too and invest in REAL stocks then the market will stabalize. THERE is NO recession we dont create.

267 2018-06-21 21:06:20 Buggy makers are warming up to lobby congress right now - and I'm getting long in typewriter stocks as surely computers are about to be outlawed.

269 2018-06-21 21:05:06 Although home ownership is no more likely to make THEM wealthy than investing in the stock market. If they have capital, they’ll invest it somewhere (housing, stocks, equity…) and will get richer (through our consumption of housing or anything for which they own stocks).
270 2018-06-21 21:05:05 And talking heads follow stock prices.
They talk bearish when stocks are falling and talk bullish when stocks are rising.
Contrarians like dodo birds are a lost species.

I think I overtraded today:
I added a few good stocks that look good long term and that I studied well last night and this morning; but I also “impulse bought” ( new term?) 3 stocks that may not turn out to be so good. Let’s see what tomorrow will bring ;-)
281 2018-06-21 21:02:39 Most times, my wife has no idea what I'm talking about when I speak about stocks. Today I showed her an excel of my 3-5 year trading goals. She may not understand the trades but she sees the result of my passion towards trading. #TurningPassiontoProfits #ET

283 2018-06-21 21:02:12 She said she was a broker and has clients.  Brokers act as agents executing orders for clients of the firm.  A trader  risks their own capital buying and selling stocks for their personal account.  They are different.Thats why i commented. I was responding to the story.Not racist

285 2018-06-21 21:01:41 Good chart and makes sense. Question for you. USD repatriation should be done by year end and stocks will likely go up due to those repatriations and fiscal policy.  What happens in 2019 when The second derivative goes negative on both counts?

294 2018-06-21 20:59:03 @jeffjarvis just FYI an ICO is nothing like an IPO regardless of what Leo says.  There's no ownership of anything unlike stocks, there's no SEC securities regulations of markets & brokers on pumping & dumping etc.  Tokens are utility coins and not stores of value.

296 2018-06-21 20:58:52 WTI was flat, but oil stocks on both sides of the border got hammered. People betting on crap news coming from OPEC meeting, but a lot of bad news has been priced in to oil already. If the news is even remotely better than expected, oil could fly.
297 2018-06-21 20:58:26 I hope so!

298 2018-06-21 20:57:48 If you’re not investing in both crypto and stocks, then you’re making a mistake. Being a maximalist in either market isn’t doing you any favors. The lines between them will become blurred over the next decade. #ThursdayThoughts

300 2018-06-21 20:57:24 Again all lies. Corporations did not give raises or benefits to workers, they bought more stocks. #TrumpIsLying
301 2018-06-21 20:56:06 My man, as near as I can tell your entire livelyhood is wasting your time.  You literally think you can predict market valuations of stocks over short periods of time based on expected GDP data that is never accurate.  I'm just sitting here stunned at the entire premise.
302 2018-06-21 20:56:00 Eyals obviously never been wine tasting before has he the absolute Fuckin amateur, do you fuck swill it what a dickhead

306 2018-06-21 20:54:26 Oh man, I have so much money. Just liquid assets, ready to be thrown into things like “stocks” and “brokerages” and the like. This is a perfectly targeted ad
307 2018-06-21 20:54:18 Sold all my $URA today! Don’t like the rebalance. Buying my own basket of #uranium stocks instead.
308 2018-06-21 20:53:31 Not happy but it’s fair
309 2018-06-21 20:53:14 Looks like shipping stocks are on the move!
310 2018-06-21 20:52:49 Perfect storm today. Indian/EU tariffs (again on meaningless stuff like orange juice/Harley Davidson) and online sales tax Supreme Court decision AND the OPEC meeting. Crap day for stocks, but it'll be fine.
311 2018-06-21 20:52:31 Wow, what a disaster day.... 1st, got a lot of posters to block... 2nd, guess we need to be less chatty cathies or talk cautiously about the stocks we play... Maybe it will act 'appropriately'... $BIOAF $BIOA .... A fair & honest observation
312 2018-06-21 20:51:57 Billionaires and Corporations got big cuts to buy back their stocks while poor and middle class (majority of Americans) were screwed. Stock Market is losing 1% per day. All these lies and bashings to protect mid term elections is not helping.
313 2018-06-21 20:51:32 If we are interested in saving lives why are we not as passionate about banning alcohol as we are about banning bump stocks and assault riffles?  Many. many more lives are lost to alcohol.  Are we being logical or emotion driven?
314 2018-06-21 20:51:32 The top five stocks that fell today were $MRO, $CXO, $AMD, $URI, and $XYL.
315 2018-06-21 20:51:17 Fox Biz: Stocks fell Thursday as traders continued to weigh trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Meanwhile, shares of online retailers were down after a key Supreme Court ruling on sales taxes.
316 2018-06-21 20:51:13 That's not 'liberal speak', that's fact. There is no justification for locking up innocent people. You people don't know your arse from your elbow. Absolute laughing stocks, the lot of ye.

326 2018-06-21 20:46:53 You do any commodities or only stocks?
327 2018-06-21 20:46:41 Stocks that moved substantially or traded heavily Thursday:
328 2018-06-21 20:46:32 Yep took from the poor and gave to the rich that bought back their stocks and raised the prices of utilities gas food insurance to get the poor people’s tax cut to.  Yep that is your package
329 2018-06-21 20:46:21 Not much for my pocket book, but great for people who can afford stocks and investments
330 2018-06-21 20:45:56 This was the wrong time to invest in stocks lol

333 2018-06-21 20:45:25 You mean the “food” Fishery right  ? Yep. You and I agree that was poorly handled. However, once again, that mess had its roots in Federal management of salmon stocks. Byrne didn’t make it any easier though.
334 2018-06-21 20:45:11 I need to get back on my stocks.

338 2018-06-21 20:43:43 Sam, is there any word in my previous tweet, that’s incorrect? My expectations for signing to Fred’s letter was to hear indep opinion on which tech stocks are future leaders. All I got is macro strategy letter, no tech names to go long for over 5 years!
339 2018-06-21 20:43:37 50% of my investment portfolio is in penny stocks, so you know I love to have fun
340 2018-06-21 20:43:19 Aren’t stocks down? U brag when they are up so it’s ur fault they are down. Aka tariffs
341 2018-06-21 20:43:08 How do you know Peter Fonda's career isn't now over? Or are you once again telling the future. Say, do you know what stocks are gonna go up tomorrow? I'd like to make a little money. Thanks. Just message them to me.
342 2018-06-21 20:42:39 Lets also look into how members of the GOP could profit from detaining these children? Through stocks for instance in companies like the GEO Group. Also Bethany centers which is an adoption agency.
343 2018-06-21 20:42:34 @JAZZFM91 Brad the RBC guy is nuts! It was an outstanding day for cannabis stocks in Canada.
344 2018-06-21 20:42:31 These Colorado cannibis stocks going up 
345 2018-06-21 20:42:14 Lol true, I didnt think it wa a happeneing anyway, with his injuries and just the needs of the top teams, as well as some of the rookies draft stocks that are way too high (cough jaren jackson), he’s probably gonna go 7 8 or 9
346 2018-06-21 20:40:34 I hope you owned it in the 4s. There is a long history of tiny bio cap stocks that traded like dirt until they didn't. Most never get out of the slop, but there are always some and it is grand when they do.
347 2018-06-21 20:39:53 Yeah all good thanks dude. Just absolutely flat out working at the mo - and for the next few weeks    seem to have a slight short fall in cash stocks at the moment for some reason 
But it'll get there, then maybe time for a gig or 2..
You all good?
348 2018-06-21 20:39:40 Hay Trump, my gas prices are up, my food costs are up, the interest rate is up, the stocks are down, and you have kidnaped 2,300 children. And your wife really doesn’t care, do u. You’re doing one hell of a job making America great.  Not really, u sick.
349 2018-06-21 20:38:59 May sound draconian, but prison don’t work for these young rats anymore!! Tarr & feather the twats every week for 5 years, public humiliation, bring the stocks back, I don’t know really but prison is a stroll for these cunts
350 2018-06-21 20:38:05 At @cfraresearch we have a top rating on $XLF in part because key holdings $JPM $BAC $GS $MS are all considered undervalued by our forward-looking analysts. An #ETF is a basket of stocks that trade for a fee on an exchange.
351 2018-06-21 20:37:05 Phew lad, crazy couple of days eh. I'm gonna have to get out of MJ stocks and into something less volatile like crypto. :-)
352 2018-06-21 20:35:50 Sure, stocks are down and gas’s is up. But a lot of billionaires made a few billion more. Not exactly what I’d call a win for all.
353 2018-06-21 20:35:29 @TraderJoetoKnow @OptionsIdeas just mixed them completely. Add another one to the list. No penny stocks ever. Period.

357 2018-06-21 20:33:37 #WeDontBelieveTrump it has given the corporations 1.3 trillion dollars to buy back stocks and get richer. No signs of trickled down anything, no wage increases worth mentioning, so why keep the lies coming?
358 2018-06-21 20:31:27 More stocks in at start of the week.....
359 2018-06-21 20:31:17 $RHT getting slaughtered... Ouch. #Stocks
360 2018-06-21 20:29:14 Enact tariffs, support farmers that will be directly impacted by those tariffs and make the poor pay for it.  Make America Great Again...on the banks of the poor, stealing from Medicare & SS.  Hope the 1% enjoy their summer in the Hamptons, short selling stocks.  Bullshit
361 2018-06-21 20:28:43 Tesla stocks have been consistently declining over the past few days by 2%+ damn, Elon.
362 2018-06-21 20:28:31 Lance, I hear your optimism and really hope you are right - but the facts are that $SGMO is the worst performing gene-related public co for the past three months (stocks above $10 bucks)  The forest looks better than our tree for sure
363 2018-06-21 20:28:23 Glad I sold some stocks yesterday before a big dip. 
364 2018-06-21 20:28:14 Shut the fuck up bitch

368 2018-06-21 20:23:08 Can’t condone what he did, but everyone wants to hang everyone out to dry at every opportunity, driven by social media with everyone jumping on the next bandwagon for sweet, sweet likes. 21st century version of chucking rotten fruit at someone in the stocks
369 2018-06-21 20:22:11 I feel like the reason why top players are top players is because they know how to seal the stocks stupid quick dawg like WaDi be taking their first stock in under 30 seconds that's why hes so good
370 2018-06-21 20:21:59 I didn’t play this one because there a lot going on in the market. Qqq create a bear engulfing, the fang stocks starting to slow down and INTC took a hit on news today with a bear engulfing candle everything points to more down side with VIX closing above the 50ma

372 2018-06-21 20:20:39 Some stocks I bought past week or so: $NCS, $FIVE, $FLT. All failed trades. Many stocks on my w/l exhibit similar behavior. For me this is a major warning sign to step back regardless of what indices are doing.
373 2018-06-21 20:18:41 It is a fool hardy act to sell stocks especially when the companies are making profits and earnings will drive markets higher. People emotional should attain a state of equanimity and stay & not sell.
374 2018-06-21 20:18:08 stocks are bad we are going to the great depression 2.0

376 2018-06-21 20:17:04 Lousy day all around on Wall St. 

Trade war? Border mess? Supreme Court ruling? All of the above? Or maybe none?

Stocks end near lows for session.
Dow -196, -0.8% to 24,461.
Nasdaq -0.9%, S&P -0.6%

Even the red-hot small-stock Russell 2000 gets hit, -1.1%.
377 2018-06-21 20:16:32 $TSG, $CGC and $DS are the opposite. They outperform the #market today. New highs, closing in the green! Pure strength. In that moment now, these are the #stocks where I want to put my money. But remember: It can change within a day.
378 2018-06-21 20:16:28 Hello Frank how are you? My daughter is on her way over today is her 31st Birthday and we are having a little party for her this evening! Stocks aren't looking too good the last couple of days huh?
379 2018-06-21 20:16:06 How so?  Customers will have to pay more now to shop online. It will make the malls and local retailers more competitive. That’s why all the brick and mortar retail stocks jumped on the news and Amazon, Etsy and Overstock shares dropped.
380 2018-06-21 20:14:33 just think of that i can give 10 small biotech that would be ZERO if they fell (the same as they did today and on NO news at all ) but out of bizz by next fri   lol what a bunch of F$%^&*()_ing pussy losers holding these stocks oh well >next
381 2018-06-21 20:14:10 INS will decrease food miles, enabling consumers to unimpededly access local manufacturers, includingfarmers. INS will implementthe effective "pull" system to reduce inventories and out-of-stocks that would decrease the food waste. $INS, #INS, #INS_Ecosystem @INS_Ecosystem
382 2018-06-21 20:12:48 @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr DOW is down but still looks great! They said tariffs would collapse the US and look at that we are holding steady while Chinas stocks....ehhhh they don't look soo good.
383 2018-06-21 20:12:46 Thank you! It’s exciting never thought I would be trading stocks but here I am.
384 2018-06-21 20:12:12 I'm taking huge steps to up the production value of my stream y'all and I can't be more excited to show off what I've got.

You won't be disappointed! If you are, you'll be sent to the stocks.

...and nobody wants that. You have to endure the jester, and he's terrible.
385 2018-06-21 20:11:57 Observe the #stocks in your portfolio:
- Which ones holding up?
- Which are breaking down?
Sell weak stocks or reducing size and put the money into the strong ones.
386 2018-06-21 20:11:25 World stocks fall: Europe -.9%; US -.6%. The market has held up better than I expected under Trump's assault on free trade. While volatility has increased, we've not seen a down 2% day. Investors need to realize this assault will hurt parts of the economy and market confidence.

392 2018-06-21 20:09:25 The Dow Jones Industrial Average is on an eight-day losing streak. So much for the argument that Trump was doing a great job as president because stocks were higher and 401Ks were doing well. So much winning!
393 2018-06-21 20:08:56 Today the market started lower and didn't recover.. Even $AMZN  which ususally comes back stayed low.. #stocks
394 2018-06-21 20:08:22 If you have money just sitting in your brokerage account. Load up those stocks which became victims of the sell off for no good reason. $CSIQ $TWTR $BABA $UAA Are few of them. You can thank me later.

398 2018-06-21 20:06:45 Another idle question: Why is Adobe Systems not mentioned in the same breath as the FAANG stocks? Is it simply because it lacks a mediagenic billionaire as its public face? Check out the stock's five-year performance vs. Amazon—and then its 32-year performance vs Microsoft too!
399 2018-06-21 20:06:37 When it appeared as if he was going to ban Bump-Stocks many Democrats were in support. But he doesn't keep his word with agreements he makes to Democrats. He asks for concessions while giving none, so I can see why Dems hate Trump. Both sides aren't obligated to concede to 1 side

403 2018-06-21 20:04:42 Yes, maybe but what i am seeing on the ground with stocks is increasing rotation and volatility.  Been excited about active opportunities last 2 years but really excited now.  Icing on the cake will be FAANG et al love-up rollover

405 2018-06-21 20:04:18 Why does the Dow need to be the 'leading' indicator of the market. It's only 30 stocks! Albeit really big ones, but still. Or i am just naive...
406 2018-06-21 20:04:03 Newsflash-when cash gets stronger other investments are more appealing. Gold, oil, stocks, cash-they’re all related. Treasury one month is better. So if people are moving their money it’s no reason to get freaked out.

426 2018-06-21 19:56:22 100% depends on character. The larger the difference in kill ease (Ding Dong vs. easily DIable setups/50:50's) the more you kinda have to play to avoid losing stocks early imo.

454 2018-06-21 19:40:55 I’m guessing you don’t own stocks. Or if you do, you don’t understand how the stock market works. The decisions of CEOs, POTUS, and many others play a role in how well the stock market does. A stock market collapse would lead to another depression and huge loss of jobs.

467 2018-06-21 19:33:34 but of more importance, Chris, is that energy stocks are starting to present compelling value. I've been for a long while holding on buying more but I've finally pulled the trigger on $CVE and $RRX.

524 2018-06-21 19:07:54 The market runs on emotions, so trading takes a human touch.  It is still important, however, to automate your mental and structural processes to trade CONSISTENTLY!

534 2018-06-21 19:03:09 Depends which one. Stoxx and Dax are ok. And look at the BUX too, which has broken down too. All major stocks there are clearly bearish.

543 2018-06-21 18:57:42 Same problem port #1 Stocks stop paying div or cut it, chances are the price dropped as much. Therefore, you are stuck with a portfolio showing less div income and less value... same problem. I'd be curious to know how many of those 6% yield cut their div in 2008-2010
544 2018-06-21 18:57:02 The #Hodeida port remains open and there are sufficient food stocks available to sustain 6 million Yemenis for the next month.

545 2018-06-21 18:56:48 Selling stocks in late 2008 and early 2009 for necessary income vs just receiving  dividends is an example of when most would prefer relatively safe yield to growth. Since drops like 2008-2009 are the rare exception, I agree with DG's philosophy for the after tax total return.
546 2018-06-21 18:55:55 When volume isn’t in line with price action you might want to second guess your decision to just “jump in” on a play.

552 2018-06-21 18:54:20 My hunch is it'll remain a premier international bridging asset, however by that time (consider the huge combinations of fx pairs) we'll have global programmable super-money. #XRP may become part of that super-money basket including fiat, commodities, land, property, stocks, etc.
553 2018-06-21 18:53:16 But the feeling is the time to sell is not here yet - there are still a lot of juices in leader stocks and take-out candidates ..

599 2018-06-21 18:35:29 When scanning for stocks I don’t care to look at anything other than what is buyable. By focusing on a very specific criteria I removed a massive amount of noise in my trading. I used to look at 1,000 charts a day & my mind created all sorts of piss poor crap ideas.
600 2018-06-21 18:35:17 Sounds smart, I believe stocks are basically topped out, but tech stocks seem to still have room to run. But with Trump's idiotic trade war policies, things are not looking so great. A recession is coming, only a matter of when. My guess is 12-18 months.
601 2018-06-21 18:35:17 How about us stocks

657 2018-06-21 18:08:16 Speaking in general for a few questions asked....no need to trade 15 stocks in 1 day and get scattered brained. You can trade 2-3 stocks a day and still realize the same gain as you would with 15 different tickers.

664 2018-06-21 18:04:18 how'd stocks like it when rates rose "sort of fast" in a short period earlier this yr?  Not so much i'd say.  Equity mkt cap is 150% of US GDP.  Stocks increasingly are the US economy.
665 2018-06-21 18:04:01 Narratives are driving stocks higher... we’ve become a market of narrative investors that decide where to throw money daily based upon the narrative that makes the most sense that day. No knowledge or education behind the decisions, just what sounds the best.

784 2018-06-21 17:14:19 What I mean to say is that Sharifs embezzled way too much money .. it is very possible that they have bought hefty shares in Harley street Clinic and many more enterprises.

789 2018-06-21 17:12:22 It was a driven crash in 2008 so that there can be many flash crashes until T-Bonds take control (instead of stocks) of all.

805 2018-06-21 17:07:14 Translation?  US needs consumers to simultaneously:
1) Pull money out of stocks to spend on stuff.  
2)  Put money into stocks to drive stocks up.
3)  Put money into UST's to fund US deficits b/c the Rest of World CB's aren't.  
4)  Do all of this while Fed hikes rates on them.

829 2018-06-21 16:57:41 I don’t like losers, but in the grand scheme of things it’s a plus when minor weakness in the indexes exposes our inferior holdings, clearing the way for stronger names going forward. Some stocks look mighty fine until the lipstick is removed.

831 2018-06-21 16:55:58 Because you know what his portfolio looked like. It very well could have, especially since it crashed under GW. 

The Dow more than doubled under Obama. Some stocks did triple. So you simply have insufficient info to draw any conclusion.

841 2018-06-21 16:52:15 @GerberKawasaki  podcast with @QTRResearch, def a great balance between the both of you. I do believe that Ross subconsciously conveyed a FOMO mentality around stocks such as NFLX and TSLA. 100 billion mcap on Tesla is a little too much in the current competitive environment.

934 2018-06-21 16:10:26 It’s interesting that a lot of people aren’t taking about the prison-industrial complex in regards to this “Zero Tolerance” policy specifically private prisons which if you remember stocks shot up when Truno was elected
935 2018-06-21 16:09:35 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
936 2018-06-21 16:09:25 remember when you sold all your stocks after trump got elected....
937 2018-06-21 16:09:07 Interesting.  I find it even more interesting that over the past 10 years or so, the number of listed securities as dropped from 10,000 to around 3,000 today.  I think these two factors - more investors and fewer stocks has led to the market rise.  
938 2018-06-21 16:08:56 A lot of the cannabis stocks are are flirting key levels today.
939 2018-06-21 16:08:54 If we ban bump stocks what do you think would happen? Murder with knives and bombs will continue. We can't just ban everything that looks scary. We have second amendment rights. Rights, and that means they cannot be repealed.

966 2018-06-21 15:59:20 It is. Companies have not raised wages, used the money to buy back stocks and healthcare costs are skyrocketing. It's terrible. It raised the deficit, our grandkids will suffer trying to pay this off. I'd stop trying to gaslight Kentuckians. We are smarter than you think.

1038 2018-06-21 15:24:10 Exactly---- I just looked at my retirement funds to make sure none of them are holding stocks for private prisons. Many recently dumped gun maker stocks, but everyone should lobby their pension funds/investment companies to dump them.

1057 2018-06-21 15:20:57 And $LAC price/volume didn't budge. It seems there is a negative bias to this space right now (only bad news moves stocks). This will likely be the case until more certainty in pricing and supply/demand balance trends occurs. This is no place for short term investors!

1078 2018-06-21 15:12:35 Few suggestions:
Never buy chasing a stock on its up move
Never sell stocks when it's falling
Never repeat mistakes that result into losses
Never rely on advices
Invest and remain in stocks after you believe in the stock growth prospects
Once the belief is there, do not ever…

1093 2018-06-21 15:05:30 Hi the best way to learn stocks is to be in a chatroom that will help you learn why2trade, when 2trade, and the reason behind trading each stock. There r so many chatrooms out there with so much noise that when I got started 3mos ago I was lost.  1/3
1094 2018-06-21 15:05:14 Doesn't change the impact. Relevant stocks all dropped immediately.
1095 2018-06-21 15:05:10 Rebalancing is done between asset classes, to preserve the risk profile of a given allocation. That’s unlikely to apply to crypto—i.e. the “risk profile” of 50/50 BTC/ETH probably diverges much more over a year than, say, 50/50 stocks/bonds.

1184 2018-06-21 14:36:20 If CB's continue not funding US deficits as since 3q14:

1. For rates to not rise, stocks cannot rise.  

2. If stocks don't rise, US growth ests are too aggressive & US deficit projections are too conservative. 

3. If #2 is true = upward pressure on rates.

4. Return to step 1.

1304 2018-06-21 13:59:30 @jimcramer I’ve been looking for bargains during this dip but most descent stocks seem to be closer to their 52 wk highs than lows.
1305 2018-06-21 13:58:35 Your stocks are countertrend to the index. In this market these stocks may outperform the market.
1306 2018-06-21 13:57:39 In an environment like this, dividend payers always seem to hold their footing much better than growth stocks. I am a huge fan of the techs and $FANG s of the world.

1308 2018-06-21 13:57:32 We were saying to play $NVDA a few weeks back using a levered call spread (sell OTM Put along w/ OTM call spread).

1316 2018-06-21 13:55:47 If that happened then best idea would be to get in stocks of food and fuel to last for 6-8 months.
1317 2018-06-21 13:55:28 The IBB is in the red, so the fact that most stocks in the sector are following suit isn't very surprising. Trump is doing his trade war crap after hours yet again, and this is the result. Trust me, he's really messing up my AKAO play because he never gives it a rest.

1352 2018-06-21 13:43:18 I think that crash was caused by the markets predicting a 1.4% recession in the US, based on what was seen as signals of tightening by new Fed chair Greenspan. However, the Fed's response to the crash was sufficient to avoid the recession.  Was not just stocks, but all markets.

1457 2018-06-21 12:56:11 The amount of "terra forming" index manipulation pre-market using FAANG stocks ($FB $AMZN $NFLX etc.) has gotten complete out of hand. Simply buy some pre-market and easily float $NDX and $QQQ up. We need an index rebalancing as this won't end well. Mark my words.

1459 2018-06-21 12:53:48 Personally I think you’re brilliant. You drive down stocks with your policies, buy through other parties, then you’ll let other people reinvest in America. All done with other stories in the news. Who cares what folks think, as long as you get rich.

However Cobalt stocks as an investment sector are as hammered as Lithium is currently which is a different matter
1492 2018-06-21 12:36:12 Stock market is known to be a good leading indicator of economy, even with a lag.  When liquidity in stocks dries, companies need to rely more on debt to finance, putting pressure on rates and growth!

The ASX has completely broken out and it can only be a matter of time before the smaller stocks follow.

Still very patchy but some nice moves today .

1583 2018-06-21 11:39:06 I guess that's exactly my thing. It's not stocks, it's playing. But it also works kinda good so there's that.
1584 2018-06-21 11:39:05 NI on income by all means. 

NI on pensions would be a major issue and another load of cost and upheaval.

Why pensions are such a political football I don't know.

1591 2018-06-21 11:35:37 Indeed, something has to give but taxing those in retirement when they've got no chance to address it isn't the answer. 

It'll also mean that for (a substantial) many pensions will be taxed more on the way out than relief on the way in.

However, have prepped my clients for this event. 
Nifty levels above 11400 would be doubtful with the current factors that are at play. 
Even 11400 will be achieved by select stocks.

2089 2018-06-21 04:27:09 I'm pretty sure most with stocks say that as to, you know, keep up the price of the stock.
2090 2018-06-21 04:24:46 Madam, check carefully he didn't reply any of the query, so I stopped asking him,
2091 2018-06-21 04:24:29 You don't have any authority to test someone and your tweet applies to you as well. You might want to watch your words before speaking as San might actually be a Saint for a few out here. Sorry again to have interfered but i was really intrigued  (n/n).

2094 2018-06-21 04:22:40 Many stocks could be argued to be "undervalued". The big things for me is the BOD and Advisory board of this company. These guys stamped their name on $CYBX. Guys that worked at Apple, Microsoft, Oracle. They don't need money, they believe in the company.

2101 2018-06-21 04:17:53 Which stocks??
2102 2018-06-21 04:17:47 We have so many stocks now that if i keep asking u it will take many many days. Just not sure which to keep and which to switch. :)
2103 2018-06-21 04:17:10 If you check the tweets, there are only 2 genuine queries out of which San has replied to one and not replied to one. So i think the ratio is 50-50. Now, given that San has a huge following, we can expect him to miss out on one or more mentions (2/n)
2104 2018-06-21 04:16:39 Sometimes it happens. All successful traders are also human beings and they might miss answering few queries and sometimes they take a break to control their emotions. So there is no harm to ask one more time and should not develop any opinion like this!

2322 2018-06-21 01:41:47 Sir, its more of a political post than busssiness,
2323 2018-06-21 01:41:34 One of these days, we are going to get a press release that the U.S. and China have worked things out.  Could be months from now, but when it happens these five stocks will rocket: $BA $CAT $DE $UTX $MMM Anyone have additions to this list?
2324 2018-06-21 01:39:15 Diversification of financial instruments thru stocks, mp2, cooperative, life insurance, emergency funds, education, savings and family fund is my number one priority as of now so I'll neglect any other unplanned expenses. 
2325 2018-06-21 01:38:54 Un supermarché comme Carrefour perd en moyenne 5% de ses stocks dû au vol, je sais pas si tu te rends compte de ce que cela représente en volume de ventes. « L’élan charitable » et puis quoi encore ?

2330 2018-06-21 01:35:27 Kay with the FANGs being such a big component of QQQ now, if FANGs crash or have a big correction, shouldn’t we be cautious long QQQ? Or will QQQ consolidate instead while individual stocks correct? Thanks!

2334 2018-06-21 01:34:33 I don't need to mention prominent rampers for lithium cobalt etc but I can guarantee there is zero correlation between EV and most of the garbage these au spec stocks plug  company risk or management scamming is the major factor not whether EV and the products are the future
2335 2018-06-21 01:32:39 If it's so dangerous, then should have more dfo checking. Lack of interest by dfo is not good for pickers & the locals who don't want stocks decimated. Less crabs are there & I see buckets of clams in pickets hands.  Do they even have licenses  I see the whole family picking
2336 2018-06-21 01:32:14 Not letting people get to me. Not letting anything get to me. Negativity gotta go. Nothing but good vibes, research, stocks, and happiness from now on

2343 2018-06-21 01:25:21 @aim2gain never forget the “3 day rule of biotech” which means biotech stocks/ETFs typically rally at minimum 3 days and sometimes extended
2344 2018-06-21 01:24:46 Stocks are only cheap if they are going higher after you buy them.
2345 2018-06-21 01:24:26 It's easy to start a trade war when your boss points out to you what stocks he plans to attack so that you can sell before they tank.

2349 2018-06-21 01:17:51 Square cannot cancel it. It would be a business suicide if they did. Fans would be livid, and stocks would take a nose dive

Put all their savings into mango stocks. Can't retire.
2351 2018-06-21 01:14:03 I’ve ask before does it go forward to assie stocks ? Got to be cheap :)
2352 2018-06-21 01:13:17 The truth is this has been in the works since Gingrich was Speaker. There are no plans to unite children who have been taken from a parent. The private industry stocks are soaring. This is not about immigration. This is about cheap labor in labor camps. Truth.

2354 2018-06-21 01:12:20 Mexicans are NOT taking our jobs.
Corporations are. Greedy corporations thinking of higher quarterly profit reports to boost their stocks instead of creating more value for customers communities and workplace team members. They pay workers less so we need cheap Chinese goods.
2355 2018-06-21 01:12:04 That was the intent. No wonder stocks in privatized prisons & housing facilities went up in 2017. The foster parent program was in dire straights until recently. Shameful behavior of Trump Administration & its corruption

2360 2018-06-21 01:07:14 Four stocks, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, i.e. FANG, are worth more than the bottom 40% of the S&P.
2361 2018-06-21 01:07:09 I don't know if your PT of $432 will hit soon, but i took my $NFLX profit today at $419. Want to lock in before Trump and China fight like little kids. If that happens, high PE stocks like NetFlix and Amazon will take a nose dive. $APPL's recent decline may be a warning sign

2365 2018-06-21 01:05:39 It would have been better if when I bought the FANG stocks so many points ago I would’ve fallen into a nice deep coma and then wake up today to so many dollar signs. But no. That did not happen 
2366 2018-06-21 01:04:20 I'm interested to know 1) Are these private contracted facilities? 2) Who owns them? 3) How much money do politicians make from kickbacks/stocks from these companies? Was this all just a smokescreen to keep other bills/issues out of the headlines?

2369 2018-06-21 01:03:03 Go to a metrobank and get the forms, submit, wait for them to email and boom. Note Lang that market has been down for a while. Nevertheless, it’s good to get feet wet and learn how stocks and MF work this way.
2370 2018-06-21 01:02:48 Hello we have stocks po on hand!
2371 2018-06-21 01:02:19 old retweet -- back when I was a sucker for pump and dump OTC stocks - thankfully those days are over.

2375 2018-06-21 00:57:49  Yea my fiancé loves Taco Bell. He eat it so much he can buy stocks 
2376 2018-06-21 00:55:58 Adding a long tail of number of stocks without a material weighting does not do anything for diversification.

Not to mention the correlation of FAANGs, or anti-trust risks.

Reverse Cap can flatten the distribution of stocks within S&P when used in conjunction.

2377 2018-06-21 00:55:24 I’m going for your stocks before our opponents now 
2378 2018-06-21 00:55:11 1.Kidnap babies, use as hostages for wall and private prison fodder
2.When people catch on, do misleading exec order to detain whole families indefinitely. 
3.Private prison stocks rise (See Jeff Sessions portfolio) 
4. Do CIA-style midnight renditions with already-separated kids
2379 2018-06-21 00:54:58 Now my unprofessional & inexperienced advice?
Go invest in some stocks within the next year. Hold it for however long the recession holds out + another 3-5 years when the economy stabilizes. Then sell it
2380 2018-06-21 00:54:37 1.Kidnap babies, use as hostages for wall and private prison fodder
2.When people catch on, do misleading exec order to detain whole families indefinitely. 
3.Private prison stocks rise (See Jeff Sessions portfolio) 
4. Do CIA-style midnight renditions with already-separated kids
2381 2018-06-21 00:54:15 If you recall the August 2015 plunge it was that week where news came in China’s economy was slowing and all stocks were sliding 3-4% drops multiple consecutive days. That’s when the VIX was at its highest in the recent past
2382 2018-06-21 00:54:02 Recommendations on stocks to short, sir?

2390 2018-06-21 00:51:06 I thought I'd experiment with #robinhoodapp last year and buy some penny stocks. Down $700+ I don't think I'm going to be the next #wolfofwallstreet  on the other hand I passed up opportunities on amazon and netflix damn that's a double entendre
2391 2018-06-21 00:50:11 This is why you spread your risk: so many unknowns.

2393 2018-06-21 00:47:50 Potato Chip stocks just went up!

4. Do CIA-style midnight renditions with already-separated kids
2395 2018-06-21 00:46:48 I find it odd, how the S&C are almost neck &neck over 10 year periods,yet the L funds put more % into I fund (which has done poor over 10 yr period), than S. to brainless L funds. Also,I’ve read traditional “100 minus your age=% to stocks” is outdated & no longer applicable.
2396 2018-06-21 00:46:46 Nate if you never sell stock, then how do you get profit to reinvest in other undervalued stocks?
2397 2018-06-21 00:46:33 Good friend of mine just said “I’m thinking about selling my magic cards on eBay to buy Canadian weed stocks.” This is pretty much is a good description of my friend group
2398 2018-06-21 00:46:13 I’ve heard others say they’re safe havens because of their secular growth stories... one day people will learn that stocks aren’t safe havens... like “low vol” staples stocks that almost all took a 20% haircut recently in 6 months
2399 2018-06-21 00:46:11 Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts bordering to the east, South to Washington DC and now the whole country of Canada to the north have legalized recreational marijuana, Throw marijuana smokers in jail when marijuana stocks are traded on Wall St.? "Makes sense"?#Alternatereality
2400 2018-06-21 00:44:14 If you really think the market price reflects all information, you're sadly naive and I hope you don't trade stocks.  That is theory not reality. Price reflect emotion, hope, truth and falsehoods.
2401 2018-06-21 00:41:40 What are plans for reuniting the 2,300? As a mother,how can you think this is a win when 2,300 children remain effectively ORPHANED by your dad. Am contacting every store that stocks your lines & let them know y I’m boycotting @amazon @Bloomingdales @bluefly @BedBathBeyond @Macys
2402 2018-06-21 00:41:19 The 1Q 2018 GDP report (3rd estimate) will be released on June 28, 2018 at 8:30 am ET. The current report has the GDP growth at 2.2%.

The 2Q 2018 report will be released on July 27, 2018. Advance projections are strong for the 2Q, at 3-4.7%.
