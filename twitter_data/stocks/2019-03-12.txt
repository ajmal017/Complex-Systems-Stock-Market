5 2019-03-12 23:56:58 I didn't even know they were public until I saw an article about airline stocks taking a dive today. JetBlue didn't. It's also one of the cheapest airline stocks from what I could tell.. vs Delta, aerican airlines, Southwest, etc

14 2019-03-12 23:49:36 Very well said. If there is going to be a huge wave coming for US pot stocks, the big money will flow into the big names first.. like we've seen time and time again with Canopy. I'll be betting mainly on the bigger names, i got some CXXI too though.

40 2019-03-12 23:46:10 Thank you. I just feel that April 30th date has to be wrong for some. Lool or less pot stocks twitter will be broken.
41 2019-03-12 23:46:06 you are a beacon of truth this is just facts. people who are allergic are cowards and deserve the stocks
42 2019-03-12 23:44:37 NEW DAWN FACTION stocks slump
43 2019-03-12 23:44:28 Is it really true that BIG3 stocks has been dropped?
44 2019-03-12 23:43:28 The AG should investigates the financial relationship between the Deutsche banks & Hilary Clinton who made millions from speech & stocks. Clinton has invested to the Deutsche bank.
45 2019-03-12 23:43:11 Explain how Stocks dropped by over 15 points when Hillary Lost! Word is out there that GE had to pay off money that was paid to her campaign
46 2019-03-12 23:42:12 How do you become a multimillionaire? Create or buy stocks in "green" companies, create a fake "global warming" / "climate change" narrative, cry "the sky is falling", wipe out any competing non "green" companies, cash in when you've created a monopoly. Instant socialist wealth.
47 2019-03-12 23:42:12 Hey Pot Stocks ! Thanks for following along and if there's any topic you'd like me to look into or company to analyze feel free to ask!
48 2019-03-12 23:41:40 Oh, I almost forgot. What about the stocks in people's retirement accounts? What happens with them? Do we expect seniors to just eat the loss?
49 2019-03-12 23:40:38 Health care stocks stabilize after recent plunge on fears of govt policy changes. Tues. movers:

UnitedHealth $UNH +1.2

S&P 500 +0.3%
50 2019-03-12 23:38:52 That's because of profits. US have no higher priority. The rest of the world puts lives ahead of stocks. Shameful.
51 2019-03-12 23:38:13 You can use unusual volume and scan for stocks up on volume but still within a percentage range before they run and watch the accumulation line 
52 2019-03-12 23:37:59 Doesn't matter what the chart looks like, in this market everything's a buy. Every day I wake up and put my entire life savings on stocks just like this one. Banks love me.
53 2019-03-12 23:37:02 Well... I dare not enter the ring with you over retirement strategies. But what I took away from this data dive is simply the crapshoot of the market in the short term vs. the historic reliability of stocks in the long term. Plus, most importantly, it’s a pretty GIF

59 2019-03-12 23:33:03 Tried many markets and have found the ideal market for my personality. The only downside is the timezone issue. (That being said I wouldn't be surprised to see myself eventually in ASX stocks, as I get older and can't manage overnight).
60 2019-03-12 23:31:41 Glad I sold my inherited parents’ stocks of this atrocious bank when they backed #DAPL 
61 2019-03-12 23:31:26 Possible......watched a fireside chat yesterday with Milken & he said something which got me thinking,"It's not a stock market anymore, it's a market of stocks." which could fly, stocks performing on their own merit, independent of general market consensus, dependent on sector.
62 2019-03-12 23:31:22 Alternate headline. Wood chipper stocks surging!
63 2019-03-12 23:31:12 Some of it. I think other causes involved. Either way, a combo stock and bond bubble poses more risks to stocks than just a stock bubble.

66 2019-03-12 23:28:34 Don't invest in stocks until you know how much the bank comissions and the taxes will cost you. Learn fiscal law and use it to pay less taxes and search the bank or platform that has lower comissions.

67 2019-03-12 23:28:16 Correct, but all those systems are based on stocks and flows. An all-male crew would need more recycling systems simply because they are using more supplies per unit of time. Add redundancy requirements to both the recyclers and the stocks, and the point stands.

72 2019-03-12 23:24:51 You don't load that many mags unless you're going to use them. They don't store well loaded. No way this was a sale. Those were meant to be used. Also, neither bump stocks nor high-rise Strip casino suite make sense for a sale.
73 2019-03-12 23:22:57 Being long treasuries since October has been a great investment. Don’t get addicted to stocks. A lot of opportunities out there.
74 2019-03-12 23:22:49 Stocks are removed from AK47 and Chinese AK clone Type56. This is very common under jihadi groups in southern Russia. Makes the gun smaller and better to hide while firing from a motorcycle for example.

76 2019-03-12 23:21:18 One of my favourite long setups... I trade stocks so have to see at least 2x volume ok the breakout, reversing volume as level holds and initiate or add  to position on next break
77 2019-03-12 23:20:20 Look at the Market today!  Boeing along with 2 of it’s carriers AA and SW are feeling the crunch as their stocks fall.  However, Airbus realizes gains!  Is it the recent crashes or lack of security and confidence?  I would say security and confidence.

83 2019-03-12 23:16:02 Why,,, easy answer..they're afraid if they ground them orders will be canceled and their stocks will plummet. Instead, they'll pretend it was pilot error until the NTSB report is released in 2021 and they'll hope by then they'll have a fix for the issue

95 2019-03-12 23:08:20 . Hi @nadhimzahawi do you benefit from shorts or hedging your stocks and shares when the £ or our markets react to events such as today’s Brexit? And will you benefit from those positions on national TV advocating a No Deal? #Brexit
96 2019-03-12 23:08:16 Why not tax financial transactions? It will raise billions without raising taxes on anyone’s paycheck. People SHOULD pay a modest tax when selling stocks. Quit implying the only way to pay for anything is to raise income taxes on the middle class. Old party, not so grand.

99 2019-03-12 23:05:45 Read and learn, Sharon:
Florida Income Tax. Florida is one of only seven states that has no personal income tax. The state tax on intangible assets such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds was repealed in 2007, so this type of property is no longer taxed, either.
100 2019-03-12 23:04:30 It's the employees and the assets I'm asking about, as an example of fallout. Also, what about the 401k retirement plans that include those kinds of stocks? Do we simply allow those stocks to go to zero? That's just two complications not addressed by MfA plans, so far.

118 2019-03-12 22:54:52 @realDonaldTrump Where is the action you promised to take on gun violence over a year after the Florida School shooting. You must be afraid of the NRA or you're in their pocket. You have done nothing about bump stocks after the Las Vegas massacre. We will not forget.
119 2019-03-12 22:54:36 And if you own all the stocks but never have set foot in the co? Or to an other extreme, why not provide funding to terrorist, you are not one only providing a service. I don’t agree with here but it is a discussion that is worth having.

123 2019-03-12 22:52:16 Things I’ve learned as a #Millenial #FirstTimeHomeBuyer : checks take 5 days to clear. Escrow won’t accept PayPal or Venmo. Stocks bought in 1996 are held in awful brokerage firms that mail check 2 weeks after stock sells. The home buying/mortgage process is stuck in 1998

136 2019-03-12 22:42:00 Call me salty but some of us have to work really hard to buy makeup and @Sephora never stocks enough 500, 750 and 1000 pts rewards and we can never get to them as soon as they drop because we’re WORKING. Come on, i spend all of my money there, why they gotta do me dirty. 
137 2019-03-12 22:40:16 I got roughly $500K invested in U mining stocks. Started investing in U about 7 years ago.

139 2019-03-12 22:37:06 When Stripes start selling $HEAR stocks and its participation went below 50%, the board became "independent" but they kept a Stripes member in the board. Stripes was an insider until December why not keeping a small investment in $HEAR ?

141 2019-03-12 22:33:36 Some non fraud companies allready did with proven succes. Eg ruby creek with limited amounts in both stocks and physical. The 10% is based on pre investment.
142 2019-03-12 22:32:48 Can you direct Mr Brazil to this as he was losing the plot this morning and I think he was close to advocating putting the magistrates in the stocks
143 2019-03-12 22:32:41 Radio Shack stocks were soaring  and that dial up screeching noise was music to your ears.
144 2019-03-12 22:32:12 Stocks in window washer fluid suddenly a great prospect.
145 2019-03-12 22:31:42 I agree. The stocks were underscribed. From the ‘group’ perspective that’s not a loss.
146 2019-03-12 22:31:39 This sounds like a brilliant scheme. Tell us more... 
147 2019-03-12 22:29:55 That doesn't change the fact that the stocks were undersubscribed. Not trying to make any deeper point
148 2019-03-12 22:29:39 El Manchester City ganó 7 a 0. No manejan bien el tema de stocks y flujos en competencias con formato de eliminación directa.

150 2019-03-12 22:29:19 Pour lutter contre les plantations de coca

151 2019-03-12 22:28:54 i recommend an investment in juventus clubs stocks (Juventus Football Club SpA) at least til the last 8 starts. they been down and they will be up this week.
152 2019-03-12 22:28:51 "Dark Clouds I can see through" is one of my favorite quotes by @DavidGFool that helps me focus on good companies when their stocks prices are declining due to Qtrly misses, temporary issues or Market volatility in general. Helped me a lot in Jan/Feb'16 and 4Q'18. 
153 2019-03-12 22:28:05 Business as usual. Reaction on #Brexit headlines muted again in #FxMarket
#Stocks not higher (!) - at least one surprise
154 2019-03-12 22:28:03 So when do hear about how this is depleting fish stocks in the Atlantic? Lol
155 2019-03-12 22:27:46 They always win when there are big shifts in stocks shares and currencies. This is what they were hoping for!

159 2019-03-12 22:25:39 Anyone can acquire the know-how for analyzing #stocks.
160 2019-03-12 22:25:33 The only thing Dems should do is simply restate the lies and point out hypocrisy. They hate that. Like, "Repugnant Right is pro bump stocks and assault rifles while being anti-background checks. This has made us THE most dangerous first-world country."
161 2019-03-12 22:25:32 The fed and the govt don’t understand economics. 

They abuse monetary policy to cut short recessions and reinflate asset bubbles so politicians can point to those bubbles in real estate and stocks to keep pushing the lie that the economy is great so they can get re-elected.
162 2019-03-12 22:25:24 What the old people gonna do tho? Worried the stocks gonna drop? it’s not cuz homophobs don’t care as long as it’s making them money. Young people don’t care, old homophobes can riot in the nursing homes we remain unbothered. If it gets rid of homophobs in the fandom then 
163 2019-03-12 22:24:39 Definitely worked hard.
164 2019-03-12 22:22:16 Potential risk on trade coming up so stocks should get some lift..

Did You know you can buy stocks of Goldmines, very interesting STUFF, but non ethical labour and polution.....
167 2019-03-12 22:20:25 Congratulations @timothysykes and @StocksToTrade on this special day closing the NASDAQ. An honor VERY WELL EARNED over the years, bringing so much value to so many people. Congratulations. 
168 2019-03-12 22:19:32 Nvm stocks are for the feet and a stockade is not that.
169 2019-03-12 22:19:28 No, stocks just fell 14%, as far as I know, due to the controversy.
170 2019-03-12 22:19:28 Did you ever tell your ma you liked something and she actually stocks up on it to do you her and the rest of Finglas ,alright ma I said I like square bars you don’t have to buy every single one in Dunnes
171 2019-03-12 22:19:14 No, it takes away health care from the poor and sick and elderly and Illegally removes money from the Trust Fund of Social Security and makes the rich richer by increasing their portfolio for stocks with defense contractors.  He's removing opioid money from vets with the Emergenc
172 2019-03-12 22:18:17 Those were not fully automatic NFA weapons. Those were semi-auto's with bump stocks... Secondly, we've been told nothing but lies about what happened in vegas. The official story has changed 3 times and still quite a few things don't add up. They never even found a motive...
173 2019-03-12 22:18:06 The stocks? Stockade? Something like that?
174 2019-03-12 22:17:01 Should have scooped up some....I did at 2.19. Should be on everyone's radar tomorrow morning.
175 2019-03-12 22:16:11 thinkin bout takin @joshuaPagila stocks 
176 2019-03-12 22:14:45 Lets hope the MP's finally come to their collective senses tomorrow and vote down No Deal and then put this Brexit shite to bed once and for all. Lets see those stocks and shares and currencies rise and see pricks like Rees-Mogg lose their shirts.

178 2019-03-12 22:13:39 Stocks plunged as ConAgra Foods, Inc. unveiled a sturdy cucumber today.
179 2019-03-12 22:13:37 apple stocks rise by 35%.
180 2019-03-12 22:13:29 I think people forget the part about diversification where most of the benefits are achieved with 9-12 stocks. Although a caveat to that is I read a recent article with more recent papers saying 30-50
181 2019-03-12 22:13:02 at least our stocks are going down. 
182 2019-03-12 22:12:34 Quant traders are risk on about internet security stocks.
183 2019-03-12 22:11:32 Your article states that fish populations have been sustainable for decades.  How many decades would that be?  one or two perhaps?  This is a baseline argument again.  But fish stocks are sampled at 8% of catches and no one really knows how many fish there aren't.
184 2019-03-12 22:10:26 They are all good. Whole cdn midcap space is cheap
185 2019-03-12 22:10:12 Agreed. But looking at my own stocks I’m afraid all of them are quite vulnerable with limited fundamentals.
186 2019-03-12 22:10:12 Useful information..... That's why these are fabulous gifts with purchase this month whilst stocks last!
187 2019-03-12 22:09:42 I just bought a few #shares of JetBlue airlines ( #JBLU )..

First because I really enjoy flying JetBlue

Second JetBlue had not flown that Boeing that's been in the news

Third because it happens to be one of the cheaper, and in my opinion, undervalued plane stocks.
188 2019-03-12 22:09:29 Ich hatte es kurz beschrieben warum. Hauptgrund Geschichte des Charts auf Big Volumen. Aber es war ja unklar ob es den zweiten Run geben wird, daher der Boden. Es braucht keine News damit Trader in einen Wert kommen.
189 2019-03-12 22:08:44 This mentality is what's causing all of the majors stocks to plummet lmao
190 2019-03-12 22:08:32 I’m still hopeful, just Brexit, Trump and the fact that the pet shop no longer stocks the food my cat has eaten for the past 12 years has made the day suck. Tomorrow will be much better!

194 2019-03-12 22:03:54 We gave up shorting stocks weeks ago. It's all way too rigged. Treasuries don't lie and offer a much better way to play a protracted slowdown. We've got the 10-year falling to 2.25% by year end.
195 2019-03-12 22:03:07 Brexit can’t ever work. Too many deal breakers that contradict each other. It’s madness and stupidity and every single person who pushed for it without first establishing a plan should be dragged around a village common in stocks.
196 2019-03-12 22:02:31 All good CP - wedding not until weekend so haven’t put it to use as yet - how was your day trading today? Looks like the duster stocks were all down again
197 2019-03-12 22:02:11 Nice try but pointless. As an EU country we can fish anywhere in EU waters as can other EU countries. It’s not just about Spanish fishermen coming here. We can go there too. But get this-fish move around! The EU fishing policy ensures sustainable stocks so no one empties the pond
198 2019-03-12 22:01:14 I want to invest in stocks but i don’t have a lot of knowledge on it and internet is no help.
199 2019-03-12 22:01:09 I sometimes think we should bring back the stocks as a form of punishment
200 2019-03-12 22:00:30 AWESOME
201 2019-03-12 22:00:16 Thanks. No options; just stocks and hedges via NQ

I also add a bit of long leverage via ES

204 2019-03-12 21:58:33 why didnt my family sell their house, stocks, and cars to secretly make sure i got into a good school? instead i got student loan debt 
205 2019-03-12 21:57:37 BREAKING: Stocks in #AllegriOut  suffered a 1897% decline at the end of trading today.
206 2019-03-12 21:56:59 me 2 - I am betting Mike Alkin is correct about the bull market. I can't wait for it to start (been waiting since 2017 since watching video and still waiting). Every1 keeps saying the bull market is here 4 the last year but stocks have not moved (as many have gone down as up)...
207 2019-03-12 21:56:56 Please bring back public stocks and put them in the Daley Plaza for all to see.
208 2019-03-12 21:56:34 I love how much more I explode in this game. No matter the deficit if it's even stocks I feel like I can win. I got multiple zero-deaths last night and it felt sooooo good.
209 2019-03-12 21:55:38 Yup. The massive expansion of the balance sheet was an emergency measure to stem the panic of the crisis. Years after the panic has subsided with stocks making new highs after new highs, the b/s is still hardly reduced to where it was prior to the crisis. It is B.S. indeed.

211 2019-03-12 21:53:23 Thinking of going back to penny stocks... only reason I failed before was because I was getting emotional and over trading.
212 2019-03-12 21:53:00 4:13 PM : Stocks have ended the day mixed. The Dow closed -96.22 at 25,554.66 and the S&P 500 closed +8.22 at 2,791.52. Mortgage Bonds are +20bp at 102.38. via @mbsHighway
213 2019-03-12 21:52:15 $FB - Stock is un stoppable -  I wonder what happened to folks who deleted their #FB profile? Using different name .   #fb #stocks #trading #DoNotDeleteFBProfile #spy #twtr
214 2019-03-12 21:51:49 That the Dow isn't a very good representation of market performance? It's crazy to me that people attribute so much meaning to a collection of 30 stocks rather than a true index like the S&P.
215 2019-03-12 21:50:46 Quotas don’t protect fish stocks at all they’re worse for fish stocks

223 2019-03-12 21:47:19 10 yr bull mkt and he thinks we have been in a bear mkt?  thats why bond guys can't pick stocks. Because if we were in a bear mkt he would sell his appl msft crm fb nflx etc.........  Oh wait he never bought them in the first place.
224 2019-03-12 21:46:48 It's most certainly is. I've seen the comments already, that his rich, has stocks etc. Mostly by Hillary fans who hate Bernie because he had the nerve to run against her and "didn't give up earlier enough". Same tactics used to demonize Bernie that were used to demonize Hillary.
225 2019-03-12 21:45:49 There is always manipulation, day in, day out... and in all the markets.  
After seeing it in otc stocks, is where my eyes really opened
226 2019-03-12 21:45:01 no one likes taking losses :) its a pretty common cognitive bias

def not saying you should sell any stock that goes down! just that having a rule to /never/ sell stocks at a loss doesn't seem optimal, from what I know
227 2019-03-12 21:44:48 I think it's crude that's heavily manipulated and the energy stocks are the correct tell. Stay away from an overweight.
228 2019-03-12 21:44:41 Just opened a letter about a litigation settlement on one of the stocks i have apparently in a mutual fund. It was a  settlement check !!!!
$.04 !! Wow! Happy days are here again!!
229 2019-03-12 21:43:58 Ya? My stocks are down 2O% since the beginning of the year. Maybe it’s because I buy stocks that I think can help America, #AlternativeEnergy #ScientificInovation #PublicService stocks are hurting under #Trump #TuesdayMotivation #TuesdayThought
230 2019-03-12 21:43:44 We also have feet stocks in the wall
231 2019-03-12 21:42:15 Stocks in horny are soaring.
232 2019-03-12 21:41:58 And?  Doesn't mean stocks aren't affordable for people who aren't rich.
233 2019-03-12 21:41:55 Stocks only care about Corbyn...

241 2019-03-12 21:36:27 I suggest to trend the hashtag #PROTECTBLACKPINK for the increase of YG Ent. stocks. To bring back investors trust.

251 2019-03-12 21:31:42 That's not how stocks work.
252 2019-03-12 21:30:18 It’s simple. People are shit at paying taxes and once tax time comes they realize they don’t have the cash so they sell stocks. Not just weed.
253 2019-03-12 21:29:49 Wow, she seems to always be a step or three ahead of the rest.  Wonder what stocks she's buying these days?
254 2019-03-12 21:29:35 It's always EASY to have done so in hind-sight. Give someone actual capital to trade in the moment and they all lose. You can buy that $15 'How to Make Money in Stocks' Book, doesn't mean you'll be a billionaire
255 2019-03-12 21:29:12 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo

A couple countries are gunning us right now. I’ll let you guess which...
264 2019-03-12 21:18:51 Not a big reaction in the U.S. markets after the no-Brexit vote in the UK. Yields were lower before the vote took place. Stocks at near same
265 2019-03-12 21:18:48 NO. Because in recessions many who are fully invested often need more CASH. And one of their best places to tap cash is from their equities..........so stocks SELL OFF.
266 2019-03-12 21:18:44 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks close mixed as Boeing weighs.
267 2019-03-12 21:16:49 @Snapchat I think your stocks could grow more if you provided users a way to show off more.  Use the instagram model which is all about enabling people to show off more.
268 2019-03-12 21:16:22 That is a very simplistic way to look at it that ignores the part about them spending more on their own businesses instead of on stocks, shares, or putting it in offshore accounts.

Maybe @DavidLammy can explain it better.

288 2019-03-12 21:01:52 L'étalon-or est le terme utilisé dans le système régissant l'économie mondiale, où l'unité de base correspond à un poids fixe dor, adossé a une monnaie comme aux USA avant l'accord bretton woods de 1973.

299 2019-03-12 20:55:46 Do you think that the seasonality of pot stocks will change in the future? (Maybe once US becomes the major market?) Or will this pattern continue, like clockwork, as you've demonstrated?
300 2019-03-12 20:55:07 Every chance I get I keep buying stocks in every oil & natural spring water companies. Profit margin in oil & water is at a consistent high rate. Let that money work for you.

303 2019-03-12 20:53:42 Released last week Adeline. Sometimes it takes a while for funds mgrs to do their analysis and react (they are the real drivers of the big stocks). Or perhaps they're still trying to read the illegible print in the Sens!
304 2019-03-12 20:53:32 Stocks HAVE to go down before fed will cut. Period.
305 2019-03-12 20:53:07 Wow lol youve turned around.  What happened to you believing the almighty Sunny prophecy, “good stocks go up & bad stocks go down”?  I guess that means $LEAS is a good stock.  When there isnt as much greedy orchestrated manipulation swarming it that is....

309 2019-03-12 20:51:27 Hard core drunken miners term lol . Yes very good move...Oz mining stocks don’t move much. I moved to US and stumbled across XRP..this tech stuff moves quick and I feel we may well be like a Google or Apple starting out.

315 2019-03-12 20:46:40 Should be harder to file bankruptcy. People are using it to avoid paying their bills, not because they are at the end of the line. Large companies use it to screw stockholders out of stocks. Kmart declared bankruptcy, opened up days later, started selling stocks again. Thieves

320 2019-03-12 20:43:55 So proud to be part of this group @Options_ashda ....Buying AAPL stocks in their 140 levels was 1 of the several best guidance provided in this group. By far the best source for best options activity as well as stocks.
321 2019-03-12 20:43:22 La Chine a racheté tous les stocks d'or "10 000 tonnes" depuis 2016 et un veut adosser le yen à l'étalon avec les Russe pour évincer les USA pour ne plus payer le pétrole en dollars US.

346 2019-03-12 20:30:21 Lol S&P got me for a second. Wasn’t sure if you were talking about cooking or stocks.
347 2019-03-12 20:29:23 the celebrities that paid $500,000 for their kids to enter prestigious uni like are u DUMB bitch go do some coke and invest in stocks like you’d get more out of that cuz ur already rich

349 2019-03-12 20:28:16 How many of the twitter pro-nuclear crowd actually has any "skin in the game".....that is you have money invested in new nuclear either in stocks or bonds directly related to it. Just wondering....

352 2019-03-12 20:27:24 Some of us haven't divested our stocks yet.
353 2019-03-12 20:27:11 Nice gains in $TTD since putting it on the SMM Growth Stock List on Feb 4th. Up nearly 40%. $TNDM up 50%.  Keeping it real...some GSL stocks are down a bit, but that's why we protect capital with stops. Ditch the ones that are not working and focus on the ones that are.
354 2019-03-12 20:26:59 Blackpink, Ikon, treasure 13 etc deserve better, especially blackpink bc they have a comeback soon and after what just happened, YGE has been getting a lot of hate. The company is at risk, the stocks went DOWN and now we dont know what would happen to all of these artists
355 2019-03-12 20:26:03 To lose. They’ve already made a killing on the pound and stocks.
356 2019-03-12 20:26:00 I remember in high school we had to do some stocks project to understand stocks. And I still have no idea how tf they work 
357 2019-03-12 20:25:43 Even just a guarantee of a weapon and armor on medium to large buildings. Too many times I have cleared multiple buildings with no weapon or armor. Just stocks, barrels and enough helmets for an army.
358 2019-03-12 20:25:33 We do have to take all necessary steps to advance economically.  I believe that the lack of investment in stocks is mostly due to a lack of expandable income.
359 2019-03-12 20:25:23 How about because it's ineffective and often counterproductive? You don't change anyone's mind, and in many cases the person then points at the shamer and says "See? See how horrible these people are?" There's a reason people aren't put in stocks in the public square anymore
360 2019-03-12 20:24:28 I swear he doesn’t care about his female artists. He has them locked up & let’s only bp come out once per year just to make him money & not fall in stocks. FUCK YG!
361 2019-03-12 20:23:58 @DevilsPeakBeer I’m back in Joburg and want to stock up on your spectacular #HeroToZero. But finding it is a challenge. Who stocks the amber throat charming liquid in my area? Northcliff or nearby?
362 2019-03-12 20:22:55 with no doubt many powerful pple are involved, those chaebol into the biz and various idol! I bet more connections with "official" will be found...A mess tarnishing SK fame, look at how the stocks are dropping, fortunately BH is a private firm
363 2019-03-12 20:22:50 It would be interesting to see if energy tended to dominate the list of value stocks at times when inflation is about to rise. Jake, does that end to be true?

369 2019-03-12 20:19:16 World stocks ex Europe higher: US +.3%; Europe -.1%,  US investors bought on news that inflation continued tame so that the FED continued to have maximum flexibility.

378 2019-03-12 20:14:52 Not that we haven't seen this before, but don't forget the investment managers and pension funds that own the wrong stocks!
379 2019-03-12 20:14:38 As always, thanks for the advice Emmet! Do you take the same approach with this type of company as you do with the stocks in your showroom? In other words, basically just hold forever?
380 2019-03-12 20:14:13 Nerd wallet was a great start for me & gave me a good idea on what to look for but when it came to WHAT STOCKS/INDEX FUND/PICK YOUR PACKAGE !!! further along, AT said companies, my brain went bloop.

383 2019-03-12 20:12:28 Sorry, because of the 2.50 rule, you wouldn't want to short otc stocks, but you physically cant short them either via most brokers.
Yet people do short otc. Crazy loons out there!

407 2019-03-12 19:58:15 I disagree...but I’m still a btc bear. I think, at a minimum, we need to touch the 3150 resistance again, if not a 2800 wick. I’ve seen plenty of 1800-2k charts, but I don’t subscribe to that logic...too many ‘good’ things happening at same time stocks seem bubbled imo
408 2019-03-12 19:57:10 How to short sell a tweet: you borrow stocks of a tweet that you’re sure it will fail at likes/rts, you sell it quickly at market price (before everyone realizes how bad that tweet is), the tweet fails and you buy it at a lower price and give it back to the original lender.
409 2019-03-12 19:56:26 Yea no ones saying jack about the fifty or so ceos that did this crap.  Muh stock market man.  Wish I knew who they were you could short sell those stocks when they go public

520 2019-03-12 18:55:09 All his money In stocks though. Is it his fault that amazon blew up? Amazon stock could crash tomorrow and he’d have nothing

522 2019-03-12 18:54:56 @MitchMossRadio Hey Mitch. Love the show. Question for you. I’m a big fan of sports betting and legalization of it federally. I also like to dabble in stock market. Are there any stocks you like long term related to sports betting ?
523 2019-03-12 18:54:36 It's clear the ONLY thing stocks  know and understand is the word.. "optimism"  Everything else is pretty much useless..
524 2019-03-12 18:53:55 If you guys are looking into buying a relatively cheap stock AT& T is amazing and projected to rise in the next 3 years. It’s about $30 a share right now but I’d get in at about $27 and swing trading even a week with 20 shares that’s $60 for doing nothing penny stocks man.
525 2019-03-12 18:53:00 You mean like the corporation utilizing their tax cuts to buy back their stocks inflating the value of their company and paying their stock holders?  Ya correct need money to make money, god forbid they gave it to the employees working their ass off 60 hours a week!
526 2019-03-12 18:52:50 I didn't say they did. I said others said they did and it impacted their stocks.

528 2019-03-12 18:51:36 I’m delusional? Paranoid? So soaring economy? Rising stocks? Great low unemployment? Record Treasury tax receipts? All an illusion?
Read the article, The Fed’s misguided rate hike hit quarterly numbers, we’re now back on track
529 2019-03-12 18:51:01 Most billionaires invested in stock so short term they pay 34% long term 15% which is risk that the little guy can't do like them, it's risky, but that is on money they already pay taxes on, mj stocks I have 20k investment debt and risked it to make 120k risk vs reward
530 2019-03-12 18:50:51 Oh yeah! I talk this long time. As liquidity be issue now, more people go out demma shares up Wey e go run down the prices of the active stocks. This be best time to buy if u get excess cash. Sadly I no get

536 2019-03-12 18:49:41 i never thought i would have to deal with stocks at this age
537 2019-03-12 18:48:33 Cease giving him unchallenged airtime would be a good start. My personal preference would be a few days in the stocks followed by banishment to a rock somewhere in the Atlantic.
538 2019-03-12 18:48:23 Few times in life I’ve asked friends for help doing something they already knew...trading stocks, repairing car parts, making flyers, and installing speakers...instead I had to stay up all night watching videos teaching myself....help would be nice but I don’t need you mfs
539 2019-03-12 18:48:08 That's exactly what it is. Move XYZ benchmark holdings into a new portfolio, toss out a couple "sin stocks", throw a "feel good" sticker on it, mark it up by a 100+ bps, and market it to idiots that will buy it.
540 2019-03-12 18:47:40 $TLT way up since 3/1 and saying stocks are full of crap. If stocks falter here, treasuries are poised to launch.

543 2019-03-12 18:47:10 I would be a day trader in a heart beat I just don’t have $25,000 in my brokerage account yet on Robinhood. Stocks are literally so fun especially when you scalp. Its literally a game to me. A dangerous one but still a fun one if you know what you’re doing 
544 2019-03-12 18:47:09 But like TBH if my dante play is aiming for fine wine or champagne, my Nero play is a fourloko right now lmao

I'm just winging it and it feels great, mostly thinking about making sure I get trigger stocks and use arms when I won't get hit
545 2019-03-12 18:47:09 Level 2 is thin.  Volume is not there yet.  I would say this is nice to hold in your back pocket for a month or two, then revisit.  Personally, I play stocks under .05, even .01.
546 2019-03-12 18:46:48 Yeah:
1. Buy stocks 5 years ago.
2. Have FHFA director announce to his team that he’s finally fixing shit that previous admin fucked up. ( all the while hoping someone in the audience has a tape recorder )
3. Don’t make any trades

In summary, that’s how insider nontrading works
547 2019-03-12 18:46:45 Great device, but will i be able buy it?? since in flash sale the stocks get over in just minutes. Please no flash sale.
548 2019-03-12 18:46:40 ngl I basically picked those 2 cause of you.

if I ever tried to get good I'd main puff and then pull out a pocket ZSS to take braindead stocks after dropping the first round

552 2019-03-12 18:43:58 Boeing stocks will suffer from this
553 2019-03-12 18:43:32 I’m vary confused with the chase variants, are they part of the elite series? Or a store exclusive? If a store stocks the normal does that mean it will also stock the variants as the same thing? So much confusion this year!
554 2019-03-12 18:43:21 What is the expected outcome for peoples investments as per Brexit?  Are you diversified into international stocks/investments or just in U.S. based companies or whatever country you reside in?  What is the potential impact and how long is your investment view (in years)?
555 2019-03-12 18:43:12 Looks like you don't own any Boeing stocks....

557 2019-03-12 18:42:30 either way i can only afford to invest in penny stocks rn
558 2019-03-12 18:42:21 Give us an extra min tim 
559 2019-03-12 18:42:18 Just because he “makes a couple mill” from getting directly paid from amazon doesn’t account for the billions he gets from amazon stocks. Only reason he “gets that salary” is because he wants to seem more modest. I’m not knocking him at all but dude running a monopoly

565 2019-03-12 18:40:53 I usually invest in penny stocks and typically stay between $2a share up to $30 a share and buy anywhere from 10-30 shares of each (I hold 3-4 different stocks at a time)but Im starting to invest in higher more “safe” stocks averaging a share from $50-$150 with 3-4 shares of each

569 2019-03-12 18:39:44 Have you ever seen the migration stats of UK unskilled workers?? For some reason, UK workers tend to want to remain at home near their families and friends, rather than up stocks and move to Poland for a third of their UK equivalent wages.

593 2019-03-12 18:29:47 Stocks must surely collapse soon.  There’s been no volume on the SPY and QQQ etfs on this two+ month rally.

596 2019-03-12 18:28:34 Ew I got my account restricted because I wanted to day trade my stocks today instead of swing trade them and on Robinhood you can only day trade 5 times in 5 days. Scalping is so fun and makes things more interesting and fast money is niiccceeee
597 2019-03-12 18:28:30 so much Hot Penny Stocks for following me! I cant wait to check out your tweets, I love new people!!! Have an amazing day, if for no other reason, how about because I told you so 
598 2019-03-12 18:27:40 Stocks are moving today 
599 2019-03-12 18:27:34 By morning Boeing stocks will have dipped by over 10%
600 2019-03-12 18:25:08 stocks = treasuries with higher return (per the Fed)
601 2019-03-12 18:24:36 All my stocks are doing well 
602 2019-03-12 18:24:19 EIA never adjusts weekly data so you have to use monthly data for the truth (also subject to revision). Not just production but stocks, imports, exports, etc.
603 2019-03-12 18:23:52 YGE was losing money because of YG  Plus(non-music brands like makeup, etc) and the $11 million loss due to Mixnine. The cbs and tours helped YG make up for the loss. YG needs to do something about its image and investments before they even think about the stocks rebounding.
604 2019-03-12 18:23:39 Key Learning on the 'Recovery' from back end 2018: The Fed hiked rates from 2.25% to 2.5% last December and stocks fell 20%. @TheResetSniper
605 2019-03-12 18:23:35 Hey guys what stocks do you think I should invest in?
606 2019-03-12 18:23:30 Treasuries are behaving as tho stocks are in the midst of a significant selloff...but stocks are rallying...
607 2019-03-12 18:22:52 you know they won't. Fed is about saving banks/stocks, not people. Powell was very clear about current fed policy and how well it is working for the "immune from global chaos" US.
What would possibly force that change? Powell acknowledgse the inequality exists?
608 2019-03-12 18:21:37 Lol smd @Boeing. Get wrecked in the stocks.
609 2019-03-12 18:21:08 $FXI china ETF is at HOD, some traders will make big money soon if they are in the RIGHT china stocks
610 2019-03-12 18:21:02  I should do it one day  but I’d have to do stocks, certificates, crypto & etc  my bank don’t flex that hard lol
611 2019-03-12 18:20:53 AW was what we got, net for AF. Kelly's stocks gone down a bit from the heady "off to Liverpool" rumours
612 2019-03-12 18:20:48 I think buyers had a better sense of the risk involved with penny stocks, than they had in the recent bubble in real estate. The view that house and condo prices can only go up was pretty widespread, and firmly held. and not just in Vancouver.
613 2019-03-12 18:20:42 sticks and stones? more like stocks and bonds...jk idk what either of them mean...keep scrolling...evth is fine...
614 2019-03-12 18:19:19 Hey man, I'm looking at those charts... gem isn't the word I'd use.
615 2019-03-12 18:19:14 How long did it take you to go from 100 to 4k only trading stocks, there? That's super impressive.
616 2019-03-12 18:19:06 but there is so much risk in bonds.. shouldn't I just buy stocks and stay safe?? ;p
617 2019-03-12 18:18:03 Correct that’s why I only play stocks not options
618 2019-03-12 18:17:48 IF THE UK HAD THE COMMON SENSE 2 EXIT THE EU MONEY WOULD POUR INTO UK FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE? STOCKS AND SHARES WOULD RISE? UK£ WOULD SOAR? LIKE IT USED TO?
619 2019-03-12 18:17:19 It's the only answer.  If 1% controls 90% of the wealth, 10% of households own 85% of the stocks, and they're definitely not all or even mostly in those groups, what else could it be?  Not to make everything about money, but Reagonomics ain't been a return on their vote.
620 2019-03-12 18:16:56 I’ve bought plenty of stocks that were wrong but when things change cut it and Boeing has big problems for a while
621 2019-03-12 18:16:55 Why does anyone pay attention to the VIX anymore anyways? It’s become a lagging indicator.  Stocks up, VIX down and vice-versa. It sure doesn’t measure volatility in the market. For the last 3 months, stocks have been nothing but volatile regardless of direction.
622 2019-03-12 18:16:46 @threeletterman3 They put money in stocks we just bought bricks the plug pulled up to the spot with a forklift @BennyBsf
623 2019-03-12 18:16:07 Most people raid bread and milk before a snow storm. Marshall stocks up on bananas. He always does things his own way.
624 2019-03-12 18:16:04 This is so selfish of you, am afraid to tell you bluntly. People are dead, families around the world are mourning their loved ones yet here you are celebrating the stocks
625 2019-03-12 18:16:03 All noise. Stocks will keep rising so this doesn’t matter.

627 2019-03-12 18:15:31 $FOX traded 7.13M shares so far, which is 2.9 standard deviations above its average volume at the moment. That only happens 4% of the time on SP500 stocks.

629 2019-03-12 18:15:27 The rumor is an EXO member (no name was given in the news articles, person above asked if it was Sehun, they didn't say it was Sehun) was in the chatroom. That's the rumor. No one said it was true. I said that it likely caused the stocks to drop.

634 2019-03-12 18:13:24 Thats what the Dark Army is for and our knowledge of the real World Wide Web aka ("Dark Net", We go underground rip people off on their stocks just like Buffet does and other hedge funds!

647 2019-03-12 18:08:54 $PLAN with similar action as $GH. Such v-patterns can work but I am rather sceptic. Both stocks could need some more time. Anyway, if you are sitting tight with a average price around the original entry of 27$ you don't have to bother as this is not a red flag.
648 2019-03-12 18:07:52 I have a hand-knitted shawl of a traditional Shetland lace pattern. That must count for something. Am trying to find an online pharmacy that stocks Victorian-style cough mixture with the laudanum and cocaine.

651 2019-03-12 18:06:30 Indigo stocks would have nosedived by tomorrow.

660 2019-03-12 18:03:47 As cool as it was to win my own tourney. I didn't do a single of these cool things in bracket:

- Confirming up tilt off mortar, to kill as early as 70% vs light chars

- parry -> up tilt to take stocks

& kept flubbing mortar -> roll getup punish

So much room for improvement

662 2019-03-12 18:02:12 I absolutely think it’s a good idea that governments invest in stocks. It can be dangerous if wankers are reigning the horses, BUT that can be said about anything at anytime. This is a good way to support the country and its people. #SunOfMan
663 2019-03-12 18:01:59 For my 23rd birthday I’m investing in even more stocks..... the ones I got now need Friends

665 2019-03-12 18:01:10 Yes, even when trump met the Korean leader:

The market trading volatility increased just before the meeting.
It calmed down during the meeting.
And when the meeting was over, stocks were bought again.
666 2019-03-12 18:00:48 Boeing stocks crashing. @POTUS trip to  Vietnam involved. They are using everything they can. Let’s stand together and be prepared.

669 2019-03-12 18:00:02 Yeah, I kinda guessed? And yes, wood stocks and horribly expensive machining are like the defining features of early SMGs. They were dropped for much cheaper and faster to make parts around WW2, mainly like stamped metal.

678 2019-03-12 17:54:44 It’s more of a simpflication to make a point than financial illiteracy, changing “bank” to stocks and hedge funds does not detract from the point
679 2019-03-12 17:54:40 One guesses that this is purely technological advancement over legalities and the cost of retrofitting the same software to 106 95 stock and the other how many 92/96 as well as the other stocks would be more than prohibitive. Not sure what happens with Jubilee PEDS though. :-)

685 2019-03-12 17:51:22 If we stopped letting overseas investors buy housing & leave them empty as to treat them like stocks, a whole lot of housing would open up around here.

686 2019-03-12 17:51:17 Definitely not a trader. I have some stocks and mutual funds for the longer term but lately - I also try spotting opportunities for short term cash investments (no F&O). I think if I get 2-3 right and 1 wrong in this attempt, I'm definitely satisfied. No unknown cos though.
687 2019-03-12 17:50:49 I’m the type of father that’s leaving stocks for his kids  @Nas
688 2019-03-12 17:50:13 Right now.. I would rather continue building my money via stocks vs creating a business. If I created a business I’d hire and I feel far too emotionally conflicted with having to be responsible for the well being of my employees so I’d rather hit the stock market….
689 2019-03-12 17:49:38 #Boeing -$BA - is the second crash of Boeing 737 Max 8 plane going to develop into a #BlackSwan event, that will spread to other tech stocks and dampen the enthusiasm/mania about AI ?
690 2019-03-12 17:49:29 far bigger threat than any group from the middle east. Watch bank stocks drop if this happens. Lots of dirty money.

693 2019-03-12 17:49:09 The government is bowing to political pressure by the ATF reversing its earlier findings that bump stocks were legal. "The executive branch just said, 'Hey, we want you, basically ATF, an agency, to rewrite, reinterpret federal law so that we can get the outcome we want.'"

715 2019-03-12 17:39:57 Equities still in goldilock mode. That might not change until we get a rate cut, which would set off a mild panic in stocks.

720 2019-03-12 17:38:07 Wow! This shows very high demand for the bonds...which doesn’t agree with the rally in stocks. Someone is correct and usually it’s the bond market. $SPX $ES_F
721 2019-03-12 17:38:06 We're talking largely about taxing future profits generated by automation to offset job loss. Cutting into future profits which will be offset by $ moving around instead of stagnating in stocks.

I'm bewildered as to why these educated politicians for some reason can't get access to their taxes. Maybe keep a copy for ur records? It makes no sense unless u don't want ppl to see them
745 2019-03-12 17:26:32 You sir are a champ! It irritates that the west is portraying this as a low cost African operator....With most of Europe now banning the max8, hopefully the Americans can drop their arrogance on this issue.Stocks are falling and they need to sell quickly.

749 2019-03-12 17:23:54 Oui, j'ai mis ça hier sur mon site, pas signalé sur twitter car les stocks du 6 étaient faibles et on a déjà eu le 7 un peu moins cher.
750 2019-03-12 17:23:38 I would suggest learning how to trade stocks first and learning what makes them go up and down, with the $1k (with Robinhood so the fees that don't kill your account balance) and then moving on to  stock options once you understand the market!

770 2019-03-12 17:12:52 Good point Ronnie. Actually only European stocks and Asian have not gone up with this latest mania. That's where I am putting my money. I find more value there.
771 2019-03-12 17:12:45 risk parity very strong today.. but bonds are stronger than stocks. imo market still needs to be convinced lower for longer doesnt mean poor outlook. expect stocks to trade around 280 or temporarily lose it. $SPY
772 2019-03-12 17:12:34 Indeed it’s a great way to scan for consolidations over multiple timeframes. I did this for awhile as well. I’ve since narrowed the stocks I potentially day trade to the ones I’m tracking (on my WL) or are in play ie gapping up or down due to news or ea.
773 2019-03-12 17:11:47 I totally agree, lol.

783 2019-03-12 17:06:21 I will fly .@flyethiopian in July and I am looking forward to do so. The common sense connects the Lion Air crash to that one automatically. Yes, speculations at the moment, yet so obvious. I'd even go so far to say that Boeing is handled differently than others. See the stocks?
784 2019-03-12 17:05:50 we have to play this stocks game for my tech apps class and so far i’ve invested in disney, google, cbs, twitter, and starbucks lmao
785 2019-03-12 17:05:50 Putting money in his pockets by the policies he is making.  He knows he can, with his words, cause the markets to fall.  Stocks are purchased at a low rate, then sold when the market rebounds.  This is just one of many examples.
786 2019-03-12 17:05:44 Stocks are dropping! Unload the free content!
787 2019-03-12 17:04:48 For fucks sake! Do these people not know anyone who doesn't have $1M in stocks, bonds, trusts or savings that they can easily withdraw to cover any expense that comes their way?
788 2019-03-12 17:04:47 Hopefully for longer than 4 minutes this time though.
No excuses this year Mr Fraser, get down to Sharktooth and get this thing done.
789 2019-03-12 17:04:46 Oh you can Google it baby... 1400 a mouth for an efficiency. 2500 for a one bed room... the market is own by Republicans... when the got their huge tax breaks they didnt let it trickle down. No they bought out there stocks to fill their pockets more... wake the fuck up...

I tripped over losing $1.20, dude I work with lost $900. F*** THIS GAME LOLOLOLOL
795 2019-03-12 17:03:14 It's not black vs white or D vs R or Americans vs illegals...it's the same today as it has been in America for 100 years...Rich vs Poor

If you're voting GOP & you make less than 250k a year & have no stocks, no 401k & no insurance...You're voting against you're own interests.

823 2019-03-12 16:54:29 Tip - Difference Between Day Trading and Swing Trading. Day trading can put you into debt fast. Day traders generally use margin so while this gives them more money and thus more potential to make profit they can lose much more. Stocks move fast and inexperienced lose money fast.

919 2019-03-12 16:16:45 Just checked Boeing stock. It dropped 10 points at the open and leveled off at about $380, until Trump’s Tweet and then it dropped another 10 points in under an hour. If someone shorted the stock then they made big money. Wonder what stocks the Trump kids have been trading.

922 2019-03-12 16:15:24 Gambling with penny stocks is fine but for real investing to build wealth all you need to do is buy low cost index funds and hold for 30 years.
923 2019-03-12 16:15:09 He's not wrong - @ReformedBroker - but so much has changed. 15 years ago half my money was in cd's that paid about 6% and rest stocks/bonds. Now probably 85% in stocks. Only CD's now are getting dusty on shelf next to LP's.  @HalftimeReport @ScottWapnerCNBC @petenajarian

944 2019-03-12 16:06:24 When they pay that on capital gains, income in the form of stocks and all other non salary income (well over 90% of their wealth) and corporations also pay that - then you may have a point
945 2019-03-12 16:06:06 Yes maybe have the corporate buybacks be used to pay employees wages that they should have instead of inflated stocks for shareholders? Greedy? Trickledown nonsense. Where’s the beef?

1009 2019-03-12 15:42:29 Shifting baseline is a huge issue, if you look were looking at the stocks 30 years ago and thinking that was normal you were already looking at a vastly depleted system.
1010 2019-03-12 15:41:44 Never! I never have understood. But I also have very little investments in stocks. I’m a physical asset investor and don’t invest my money unless 80-100% return. How? Hit my dm

1027 2019-03-12 15:35:03 ... they pull more out of the economy, a person working paycheck to paycheck is using every dollar, putting that money back into circulation, the extremely wealthy put their money into stocks and off shore accounts, keeping that money out of circulation

1037 2019-03-12 15:31:19 R u suggesting Ethiopia air accident was not Boeing's fault before any kind of proper investigation, regardless of what that means for traveller safety? Have u disclosed any aerospace sector stocks u/ur family hold? You did also insist on a space force.
1038 2019-03-12 15:31:17 It's hard to be a disciplined investor. After taking some losses I decide to tighten my stops on a few stocks. So my MELI holding gets liquidated last week & I pocket a 33% gain over 5 months. Not bad, right? Wrong. I miss out on this week's 11% run up from that point.
1039 2019-03-12 15:30:43 Guys, repeat after me: Aircraft Carriers are no place to start EU Defence. This thing is about stocks , infrastructure, interoperability, mobility & mobilization. After all that is done (and it’s a long.......... list) we can debate CSG or whatnot. We can support Frontex With EGF
1040 2019-03-12 15:30:00 YG's stocks crashed 14% in one day. The problem is that French luxury brand Louis Vuitton MH (LVMH) had invested 61 billion won in YG in 2014 through their subsidiary Great World Music Inv in form of RCPS (redeemable convertible preferred shares), repayment date is this October

1081 2019-03-12 15:15:47 Yesterday's rally was very localized. It was mostly large cap stocks, heavy on Technology. There was also some action in transportation as well as oil&gas, a natural bounce-back to the oversold condition. I am not sure this market is completely fake. Just some fake portions.

1091 2019-03-12 15:12:20 Ric, a constructive critique: given how you define “assets” your 50-50 logic makes no sense. @APompliano’s prediction that 100% of ALL existing financial assets (stocks, bonds, etc.) will be onchained (presumably on “open” protocols) is far more robust, theoretically. —>

People are fascinated with cheap stocks. 

After the 2010 rally, even i was as nothing seemed cheap. 

So i bought a bunch of PSU stocks. 

In the 2011 carnage, they all fell 25-30% & the expensive stayed relative expensive! 

Another fascination is dividend!

1097 2019-03-12 15:11:08 "pre match fixtures" ...why use Euro terminology??  

This article uses "trader" to mean risk management & oddsmaking.  By definition a trader is a person who buys & sells good or stocks.  A bookie does neither.

We do not need Euro terms in the USA, the Euro terms are confusing.

1115 2019-03-12 15:06:47 Calomiris mentioned once that bank stocks were traded on the pink sheets for a long time historically as public listing could cause a loss of confidence in the bank if stock prices fall. You want an illiquid market so insiders can sell shares but not trading by outsiders.

1129 2019-03-12 14:59:30 Why people switch is a different question (up next for us). It may be due to out-of-stocks, amongst others. The "exploitative streak" is the pattern of repeat-purchases observed before switching. The streak was observed in 280k shoppers and held out once people were targeted.

1159 2019-03-12 14:45:52 LVMH pulling investment from YG isn't a for sure thing, but it is very probable b/c of how the stocks have been looking for the past year & especially from recent events. seems like LVMH will either go from being 1st to the 2nd largest investor, or end their stock r/s w/ YG.

1162 2019-03-12 14:44:19 You're missing the point of 'shitcoins' then. Think about them as akin to penny stocks; most penny stocks are awful businesses and yet their stocks get traded daily for the profit incentives. Crypto has the additional 'advantage' of a largely unregulated market.

1229 2019-03-12 14:10:14 And here I thought stocks only went ... find the ones you like and don’t panic. If you believed in your buy, have some patience.
1230 2019-03-12 14:10:03 How? You could always do leverage without QE ZIRP...via options or margin trading. People have a lot more money than in the banking system...if banks overbid for stocks they will go under (as in 2008).

You need to prove QE leads to overvalued markets-nothing there IMHO.
1231 2019-03-12 14:09:50 Will you be listing Australian Stocks? You could be the first company to allow no fee buy/sell of Australian stocks. Most only do no fee in US stocks but still charge for funds in/out accounts. This could give DGTX an extra boost.

1290 2019-03-12 13:46:56 You mean YG's stocks?
1291 2019-03-12 13:46:48 Speed means nothing. It $LEAS is for real, it will skyrocket with real news. Let it drop. Smart ones are picking up shares
1292 2019-03-12 13:46:19 the stocks. they dont make sende sense
1293 2019-03-12 13:45:27 Or maybe LPs want both. It’s not zero sum. Do big lps invest in public market stocks and public market bonds? Yes, because it’s a different risk/return profile.
1294 2019-03-12 13:44:56 yg's stocks are now dropping right?
1295 2019-03-12 13:43:44 RIP stocks

1304 2019-03-12 13:38:24 why are some yg stans celebrating yg's decrease in stock? your idol is still under yg and there's nothing you can do about it.think of the bigger picture here, if the stocks will continue to go down, your most awaited comeback will likely be delayed because of the lack of budget
1305 2019-03-12 13:38:13 Ask about the impact of fish farms on Wild Salmon stocks...

1307 2019-03-12 13:37:57 1) Global & US Growth continues to slow.
2) Inflation that had been slowing ticks slightly higher.
3) Continue to watch trend and rate of change.

We still like treasuries, TLT, XLU, gold & mining stocks, select cannabis, and cash.
1308 2019-03-12 13:37:48 i hope everything will be clear months before Treasure 13's debut :( YG really need to debut them to raise their stocks or else they'll be bankcrupt :(

1310 2019-03-12 13:37:16 I dont think YG will delay they boys’ debut, investors are pulling their stocks on yge before october so yeah, he needs to take risk.
1311 2019-03-12 13:35:41 This one seems like false rumors, but yeah, probably a culmination of all those, and in general, same sector stocks do see a fall when there's negative news in the sector, even if unrelated to the company
1312 2019-03-12 13:35:32 He lost his biggest investor and his stocks are dropping. It’s rumored that they delayed comebacks and the debut of that treasure box group

1317 2019-03-12 13:34:02 Most prop firms are guys trading more volatile stocks and not holding them over night. Although if it’s clients money it doesn’t make it any better. Also to Eddy’s point, if there’s a spread in the markets it means people are buying other products. Dow might have lagged w/o $BA

1321 2019-03-12 13:32:31 Politico is shameless in using individual contributions from employees to Warren's campaign to impugn her candidacy. It's straight out of the Republican playbook, and usually Politico is more subtle when putting a liberal Democrat in the stocks.
1322 2019-03-12 13:31:48 Haha I try my best  I own and run a business too but it basically looks after itself. Stocks can be very profitable as part time thing. I try not to spend too much time watching it as it’s so addictive. Rather research and hold a little longer these days with odd day trade.

1330 2019-03-12 13:29:29 I have a playbook thats been doing well even in this bull market. and that is shorting a weak bounce of weak stocks. It’s a day trading system though.

1336 2019-03-12 13:26:47 He has increased the debt by two trillion, 2018 was the worst year for stocks, he screwed over farmers and those businesses that relied on imported steel, and due to his pissing contest with other countries they are expecting things to be worse this year. And that’s not all

1388 2019-03-12 12:57:58 Noticing that the opens have been tricky of late for in-play stocks. The cleaner moves have been happening later in the day. So with that being said, I'll be looking to sit out most of the morning session with a view to taking set-ups (if I get any) late morning/afternoon.

1408 2019-03-12 12:50:11 Last year OBJ finished WR15, Lockett WR16, Ridley WR22. Guice will be tough to keep benched. If AP got starts on fantasy squads last he’s so will Guice this year. It’s a great example of splitting the stocks. You don’t build a successful dynasty without taking risk & buying low

1412 2019-03-12 12:48:34 The biggest investor is now giving YG deadlines to make their stocks rise up. This is basically telling them to get their sh*t together and make plans for their artists. If they f*ck up big time again, then they are really that dumb and incompetent

A massive sell-off of X's stock could trigger sell-offs of other stocks because of fears that there's something wrong with an industry or the market writ large.  For instance, YG's stock price dropped a lot, but so did ++
1420 2019-03-12 12:45:12 SM, JYP and YG’s stocks dropped so badly..

1426 2019-03-12 12:43:14 in business aspect, investors will surely consider pulling off after YG stocks getting dropped down as hell after this... 

it worries me so much, to all the artists under YG & to future kids who's just preparing for their debut. PLS GOD, GUIDE THIS KIDS FOR A BETTER FUTURE :(
1427 2019-03-12 12:43:06 I get it thst EA has its financial calls, revenue stocks and quarters. But with premium we got the whole "straight forward" answers of when ALL expansion packs were coming. So we get hyped! Lack of content and lack of a far future roadmap makes us have doubts for BF5
1428 2019-03-12 12:42:46 What is the point in holding bad companies/stocks? 

Hope & pray isn't my way of investing. If a company management acts irresponsibly or the business results keep disappointing, I cut and move on.

1430 2019-03-12 12:40:28 Even though the bigger they are the harder they fall it’s still better to short weak stocks then market leaders. They are weak for a reason.
1431 2019-03-12 12:40:11 And it’s amazing how much this affects the kpop industry as a whole, as well. Stocks for all of the labels have dropped by some margin, with YG and SM taking the biggest hit, not to mention the general public perception of kpop as a result of this story
1432 2019-03-12 12:40:08 The stocks dropped yesterday. I want justice for the victims and want the guilty to go to jail but it’s unfortunate that so many innocents are suffering the consequences cuz of the sickos.

1437 2019-03-12 12:36:04 Can't a good case be made to just buy and hold all of your growth stocks for 10 years. Say you have 10: 3 will lose 75%, 4 will stay flat, 2 will go up 1,000% or more. And your average return will significantly outperform the market.
1438 2019-03-12 12:35:12 So if YG's stocks/ share prices doesn't rebound, LVMH will most probably withdraw. ISTG if Blackpink teasers are dropped this week or very soon.. oh damn fcking hell we know what's the reason..

1443 2019-03-12 12:34:21 A lot of movers pm, categorize them and make a plan:

1) 1st day plays
a) gap up
b) gap down
c) breakout 

2) 2nd day plays 
a) gap up after 1st strong day
b) gap up after 1st strong day

3) multiday extension (more then 2days extension)

4) dead cat bounce

1450 2019-03-12 12:31:08 When you become an MP all shares/stocks or interests in a business should be held in blind trust so there can never be a conflict of interest. Do we really trust an MP would put his £77k salary and constituents above £millions in external interests? I don't.
1451 2019-03-12 12:30:19 Money. Leadership perhaps too invested in status quo to want to rock the boat, hurt economy, tank their stocks as they near retirement sge (tho’ they should be in cash mostly by now).  Impeach: we’re gonna pay the piper one way or another

1457 2019-03-12 12:26:04 Would be very interesting to see how much of this increase in profit was made on shorting the £ or stocks listed in £s

1474 2019-03-12 12:13:36 Stocks like Reliance Industries, Maruti, Dabur, Voltas, ITC, Asian paints, HDFC, ICICI bank, Godrej Agrovet, Crompton Greaves Consumer can be brought on dips for long term
1475 2019-03-12 12:13:11 Eveready and Dish TV are comparatively better stocks. You may consider them for long term investment.

1482 2019-03-12 12:11:07 Should a rule barring MPs short selling UK currency or company stocks be introduced? It would seem to put them in a direct conflict of interest between personal gain and working in the interests of the country.

1515 2019-03-12 11:51:31 Lesson to learn from Boeing debacle. Stop investing in individual stocks. Start investing in well diversified portfolios now available in ETFs. Two examples: SPY has 500 stocks drawn from every sector. Better VT invests in more than 8000 stocks globally.

1525 2019-03-12 11:37:44 That’s a good rule. Crap stocks always get tore up when the market shifts gears & rarely recover as fast as the quality does.

“Diversifying” into these just diminishes returns.

1648 2019-03-12 10:07:42 You sure twist facts around, kid. How is Trump getting rich by himself? He owns stocks, he fixed the economy. Of course he made money. So did I. So did you unless you have no investments and spend it all on overtaxed weed.

1651 2019-03-12 10:05:41 Mogg’s £7 million since 2016? His company bets on businesses going tits up, on Britain going tits up - and do you know what? He’s helping it happen. What a clever chap! Just think of the millions he’ll trouser if Brexit happens. 

Mogg needs put in the stocks. The man’s a worm.
1652 2019-03-12 10:05:38 Yes, that was a good analysis that you provided. Thank you. I think the return down was bound to happen, probably till 44 or so. If this small & midcap rally sustains maybe it will go back to 55 levels. But, Co. earnings becomes important from next month onwards for all stocks.
1653 2019-03-12 10:03:58 Our average gain in 2018 was 32.46%. That was only since inception in August 2018 and not the full year. Non-subscribers, check out the past trades list (our track record)

The typical American household, however, may not feel much of a financial pinch as a result of the drop. For starters, stocks have since recovered much of their late 2018 losses, although they remain below the record highs set earlier in the year.

1710 2019-03-12 09:08:51 Pity mid cap stocks on the ZSE aren’t liquid. They’re where the real value is on the market:
1. When rtgs liquidity piled into blue chips resulting in premiums in Q3 and Q4 they largely left mid caps untouched 
2. They’ve benefitted from the same increased consumption since 2014
1711 2019-03-12 09:08:15 Stocks in Europe and Asia extended Monday’s gains and U.S. futures advanced as the broad risk-on mood across markets continued. Treasuries fell and the dollar edged lower, while the pound climbed ahead of a crucial BREXIT vote.  #MOMarketUpdates

1738 2019-03-12 08:50:18 No honey. I followed the stocks everyday & all agencies' stocks have been dropping since last week.
1739 2019-03-12 08:49:58 When I first got into Trading I thought Bull and Bear were nicknames for stocks.  Just proves we all have to start somewhere and we don't know it all! Education and continuous learning is key to becoming a good trader. Stay humble and remember where you came from #forextrading
1740 2019-03-12 08:47:57 If the people witness rising stocks, they’ll believe they’re getting wealthier... And if they believe, they’ll spend more... 
See not Venezuela- where the stock market is solid but humans are readily consuming pets. ;-(
1741 2019-03-12 08:47:38 It means they sold stocks now considered too high, not newly produced stuff. But revenue data covers both, so no scope for confusion.

1743 2019-03-12 08:47:12 Last year when markets rallied so high, I was new to it and bought a bunch of stocks and mutual funds.. Then markets fell and after a long time my overall portfolio is in green this week (select ones still in red)! Not buying nor selling now.. SIPs continue :)
1744 2019-03-12 08:46:20 Smallest buy in all things considered (stocks, property etc), probably an ETF. If you don’t mind dong exposure then obviously the stocks themselves

1747 2019-03-12 08:44:53 The Brexit news also lifted USDJPY to 111.34 where we ran into some technical resistance. Strong rally in Japanese stocks and e-minis helped the USDJPY. Demand for the Tokyo fixing got USDJPY to 111.44. Take note of the 100-day SMA at 111.33 and 200-day at 111.42.

1754 2019-03-12 08:39:45 A dude is trying to sell funds and stocks using standard deviation to evaluate risk. An example of a good idea that's dangerous. Risk is what remains after all our calculations. The best laid plans and all that.

1885 2019-03-12 06:26:58 Mm. Yeah. Maybe once that bottomless toxic debenture they took out has finished shorting the stock so they can convert at a super cheap price they'll really stick it to me.
1886 2019-03-12 06:26:06 For those wanting the most out of their investment, before Uber’s IPO, buy stocks of companies that have already invested in Uber privately.
1887 2019-03-12 06:25:05 Index should see some profit booking and consolidation now, Very strong rally this. Stocks would continue to do well.

Super daming stocks! 
Wantusawa kayo ngayon! 
1890 2019-03-12 06:21:17 Am I the only one who gets nervous when deciding which stocks you wanna invest in? 
1891 2019-03-12 06:20:44 @Nifty11235Mode  some stocks like hul  LT yet to touch previous high.... pharma moivning to touch previous high and IT to go for 2/3 days ...
1892 2019-03-12 06:19:31 Strong criteria lets you make a watchlist of strong stocks. Patterns help you buy those strong stocks at the 'right' time. If there is no clear visible pattern, there is NO buying.

1893 2019-03-12 06:18:25 @AnilSinghviZEE please add new stocks #Strtech closing above 277.4 tgt 300
1894 2019-03-12 06:17:54 Also what about stocks related to kpop companies that are not public? Surely this doesn't show the whole picture.
1895 2019-03-12 06:17:01 Honestly BTS deserve so many stocks from bighit if they don’t already have them
1896 2019-03-12 06:16:39 Thank you for the list of stocks i will be buying, ugly person.
1897 2019-03-12 06:15:11 Na buy stocks
1898 2019-03-12 06:14:31 stocks is stocks
1899 2019-03-12 06:14:18 Still no stocks for ABV3 and Eribong Ver 2  #SMSHOPPH_UPDATES
1900 2019-03-12 06:13:12 pl. share the current status of breath.... the stocks which started rally are looking tired
1901 2019-03-12 06:12:08 I've seen how much the stocks had dropped. Like it just doesn't smell good for them. 
1902 2019-03-12 06:11:55 The five top tech stocks are cycle agnostic and recession proof.
1903 2019-03-12 06:10:51 It's normal for stocks to drop when there's a scandal that affects the whole industry. Anyway, I would be surprised if SM is involved in this. They already had tax evasion scandal back in 2014 which was quickly dismissed (rumor is they paid off a govt official).
1904 2019-03-12 06:09:21 It means stocks will go up, since insiders might stop selling? 
1905 2019-03-12 06:09:03 Aktie von @Boeing ist gestern um über 5% abgeschmiert, nach dem 2. tödlichen Absturz einer 737 MAX in weniger als 5 Monaten .... #aviation, #stocks, #WallStreet
1906 2019-03-12 06:08:50 Easing did not help stocks in 2000 & 2008, why would it help now? When the herd is running scared it is all that matters, probably more so today with algo/passive so dominant.
1907 2019-03-12 06:06:21 YG stocks dropped by 13% (for obvious reasons) and SM by 11%, in comparison JYP stocks only dropped by like 3%. Some people are saying that its because investors have sources who know stuffs. It kinda is hard to explain why SM stocks would drop like that for no reason
1908 2019-03-12 06:06:02 Today all my 10-12 watch list stocks from d morning showing only red bar & i cant go short this market & cant buy them either as they are not giving any buy signal. This is what i was talking when scanning matters DLF Auropharma icici bank move just makes me sad. @Abhishekkar_
1909 2019-03-12 06:05:51 Not enough dead people to ground the aircrafts ? Or just you don’t want to kill Boeing stocks ? Money over safety.
1910 2019-03-12 06:05:42 Er no. Death toll alone is not the measure of safety. 

The cost of evacuation & loss of access to radiated land & infrastructure is also a significant consequence, as is damage to agriculture & fish stocks.

Nuclear disasters tend to be rare but have large & long-term impacts.
1911 2019-03-12 06:04:47 Bighit isn’t a public company so their stocks wouldn’t be affected right??
1912 2019-03-12 06:04:38 Guten Morgen, Börsen in Asien schießen nach oben, man hofft auf ein positives Ergebnis bei der heutigen #Brexit Abstimmung ..... #stocks, #investing
1913 2019-03-12 06:03:47 I expect top stocks to pare down debt significantly this year
1914 2019-03-12 06:03:31 With the Brazil index $EWZ in a cup and handle, so are the stocks $STNE and $PAGS. Both of them have top fundamentals, and the new government is pro-businees - tail winds for these 2 stocks. Keep both eyes on them.
1915 2019-03-12 06:03:23 My sons favorite. My favorite is Marajua  stocks and pot pizza!!
1916 2019-03-12 06:03:01 I will be joining Ross Greenwood tonight on @MoneyNewsShow @2gb873 (Channel 873AM) tonight at 7.45pm to discuss markets and stocks.
1917 2019-03-12 06:02:54 Hey Istrian Coarse-haired Hound why? Jessica want ask why you are mighty  dog.  stocks passover baby twin is hacking your social networks before wreath let
1918 2019-03-12 06:02:36 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1919 2019-03-12 06:02:20 When momentum is strong, picking fundamentals may not be useful. If we start looking for API stocks, Biosimilars, generics etc, momentum might be over before we shortlist a few. So, I am not looking at any fundamentals or businesses in this market. I don't wanna look stupid.
1920 2019-03-12 06:02:15 YG HATERS IS NOW HAPPY BECAUSE YG STOCKS KEEPS FALLING
1921 2019-03-12 06:02:09 I know it says we can send cards, but I wonder if I can send crochet scarves too and beaded jewelries? I am a crafter and I have so many stocks.

1923 2019-03-12 05:58:16 Btw, today I've bought my first stocks, really excited about it
1924 2019-03-12 05:58:04 @Bayer remember what happened to Patagonia and Nike? Their stocks surged, consumers supported them for their corporate stand. Maybe you can spend your advertising dollars in a meaningful way and stop supporting the black hole of Fox...can you hear that sucking sound? It's you.
1925 2019-03-12 05:57:25 With NIFTY sustaining above 11k and moving up there will be strong focus on beaten down stocks which have not participated or are still significantly below their previous highs. This has been evident in quality stocks like KNR Constructions, Motherson Sumi, SRF etc. ... 1/2
1926 2019-03-12 05:56:18 stocks to watch for tomorrow : $MOMO ( reporting pre market if good numbers - buy stock is good strategy for quick 2 -3 dollar gain) 
$DKS reporting pre market 
$TSLA can go 300 this week !!
$SFIX can squeeze to 36 tomorrow
1927 2019-03-12 05:56:13 Lmaoo all of S* stocks fell horribly as well. DESERVE
1928 2019-03-12 05:55:17 Most trading platforms that allow you to trade stocks allow you to trade options.  You’ll need Tier2 or 3 approval from your broker.  Check out how much they charge!  A couple of great brokerages for options are TD Ameritrade & Tastyworks. (Not all stocks have options to trade.)
1929 2019-03-12 05:53:15 @SamsungMobileIN Hey there Sam. Can we get any insight as to why no one has received shipment details of their Galaxy Buds which were booked last week? The order status just shows approved with 15-20 business days estimation. Are you out of stocks?
1930 2019-03-12 05:52:33 Realized Seungri is from Big Bang. That's crazy news. It's a good time to buy into YG stocks tho 
1931 2019-03-12 05:51:41 Don’t really care about bump stocks. Don’t need it. Wastes ammo.
1932 2019-03-12 05:51:40 This is trivially the question that usually preceeds all equity bear markets: some rationalization of why stocks can't go down cause it is different this time. Answer is NO
1933 2019-03-12 05:50:35 Following Stocks are giving breakout trade
MCX - Go Long
AJANTPHARM - Go Long

1935 2019-03-12 05:50:23 Get a boy that stocks his fridge with eggo cinnamon toast waffles because you once said that they're your fave sweet snack  
1936 2019-03-12 05:49:42 There can be many reasons why their stocks are falling. It could be due to some adverse economic changes and market factors. And besides the whole issue, is not affecting the suspects and their label alone but the whole ent. industry.
1937 2019-03-12 05:49:03 Today stocks higher; EUR/USD 1.126; bund yield 0.07%; 10-year Treasury 2.66%; Brent $66.8; gold $1296.5

1939 2019-03-12 05:47:00 Ok - why does SM stocks plummeted over this whole Seungri scandal? Is there anything else we don't know about?

1941 2019-03-12 05:44:48 Yeah YG dropping stocks is the only way others can go up. There's no way anyone can top YG if all their artists are active and promoting. I feel sorry to those people who celebrate one's misfortune.
1942 2019-03-12 05:42:31 @OfficialMonstaX hey shownu there will be a recession in the US in 2020 so you should buy blue chip stocks for cheap then and they'll rise back up in a year or two

1948 2019-03-12 05:40:42 Are the rumors abt TWITTER true?They  may be part of a federal investigation being brought by  Bob Mueller team. We already heard how Twitter took millions in from the Russians to place fake ads to help @realDonaldTrump win in 2016 IF YOUR  SMART DUMP YOUR TWITTER STOCKS ASAP!

1951 2019-03-12 05:38:53 Mr Prem Doshi....why u r doing such things on Public Platform.
It's in very bad taste..
Pls concentrate on your work instead.
Do you have guts to give ur higher tgts on same set of stocks in similar TF.
1952 2019-03-12 05:38:26 Keep stocks high
1953 2019-03-12 05:37:32 Stocks just like women are totally unpredictable. Unlike women they are not worthy of an emotional pursuit but a logical one indeed

1958 2019-03-12 05:33:59 #Asia@Late Afternoon: A raft of weak data on Consumer confidence & Mortgage clipped Australia's day. While rest of Asia is up firmly, led by Japan, China on rebound in Wall Street. Oil cartel's stance pushed Energy stocks higher. #KOSPI +0.83% #SSE+1.79% #Nikkei+1.86% #XJO -0.08%
1959 2019-03-12 05:32:21 @KatTimpf You took off your glasses! Awesome, you still look amazing. Either way very grrr baby.
I get the "stocks" thing though. But now everyone knows your super girl. HAHA!
1960 2019-03-12 05:32:10 Dude me too. I was like wtf why isn't there an app?
1961 2019-03-12 05:31:58 We will be invading #Venezuela soon, to get our diplomats out. @realDonaldTrump needs a win against #SocialismKills

1962 2019-03-12 05:31:55 because I'm not STT, it's a separate company and people love Tradier so far
1963 2019-03-12 05:31:10 Didn’t know stocks could be so addicting. 
1964 2019-03-12 05:30:33 Property, Stocks, or a business
1965 2019-03-12 05:30:19 I am really new to this so I apologize if my questions are of little knowledge.  Can options be done on the same platforms that stocks are traded?
1966 2019-03-12 05:29:52 2.41b shares were traded today, worth $6.37b. 535 stocks closed higher, 562 finished weaker, while 416 ended unchanged #ausbiz
1967 2019-03-12 05:25:35 Totally wrong.  The top 1% own 38% of the stocks, while all other Americans own 62%, which is worth about $20 trillion, which is not chump change.  Anyone can go to school.  It isn't proganda, it is the truth.  The proganda is that you need someone else to take care of you.
1968 2019-03-12 05:25:17 Y’all really think ksoo don’t be trading stocks and watching porn on his phone? LMAO
1969 2019-03-12 05:25:13 “Econ” wasn’t a major at the School of Business where I graduated.  Although micro and macro economics were prereqs for admission.  That’s where I learned that insider information  is the only way to profit from trading stocks in “perfectly-efficient markets”.
1970 2019-03-12 05:24:25 @StocksToTrade I’m confused as to why you promote tradier on your program, but @timothysykes doesn’t recommend them. Would you clear that up for me?
1971 2019-03-12 05:19:53 Stocks are falling because companies are not getting anything right now. None of the companies have a comeback.
1972 2019-03-12 05:18:55 #India: Market Pulse@Morning: With SGX futures up ↑+51 pts, #Nifty ↑+63 #Sensex ↑+196 pts higher at start of trade. Positive global trends helped the positive momentum. Crucial stats on Inflation & IIP are expected post market hours. Defense stocks are gaining.
1973 2019-03-12 05:18:44 My stocks are flying through the God damn roof, son.
1974 2019-03-12 05:16:46 Nice, I'm going to head right down to the bank and buy more stocks on the back of this news. Dark pools ftw!
1975 2019-03-12 05:14:10 RT sandipsabharwal: Soon
Start expecting all junk stock recommendations from "Experts"
Stick to basic, buy select stocks. Good quality stocks are still cheap why take excessive risk for a little more "Profit"
1976 2019-03-12 05:12:53 HDFC LIFE Shares dive 6%

Shares of HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd fell nearly 6%  after the company said promoter Standard Life will sell up to 4.93% in the company through offer for sale. HDFC Life shares declined as much as 5.8%

1981 2019-03-12 05:09:55 Now #niftymidcap100 also learned the trick to maintain the index rally with handful of stocks unlike broad based rally in those days.
1982 2019-03-12 05:09:33 Find good shorts in metal stocks now. Stop loss today's high. Wait and watch.

I think this is the perfect time to buy.
1986 2019-03-12 05:08:28 Btw, that's the simplest way to make money, if they were smart about they'd have the money in liquid assets and stocks to make more money.

1996 2019-03-12 05:02:01 I have an under $20 rule, but its not based on much.  Some guru type told me once that stocks under $20 go bankrupt much more frequently than stocks over $20. I dont think that's relevent for this time frame.
1997 2019-03-12 05:00:07 What we're talking about on #DaybreakEurope @BloombergRadio :
- Sterling rises as Theresa May strikes Brexit deal, will parliament back it?
- Asian stocks rise, following Wall Street higher
- Singapore is the latest to ground the Boeing 737 Max
1998 2019-03-12 04:58:16 Just realized that engaging on social media about stocks and market discussions is the equivalent of a chess player being introduced chess on a computer. 
1999 2019-03-12 04:58:16 Well YG did say Bigbang made YG but then again stocks rise and fall so if Blackpink comeback the stocks would rise
2000 2019-03-12 04:56:58 How would current issues impact stock price 5 years ago?   Yeah 5 years ago the stock was lower... that's how stocks work with a growing company.  The point being that recent choices have resulted in a significant down turn.

But I note you were never able to answer my question.
2001 2019-03-12 04:55:43 Rites - 208 to now 268
Surya Roshni - 208 to 271
Merck - 2930 to 3459
Nila Infra - 7.7 to 8.9

Last 1 month has been incredible. And IMO in most of these moves have only started. Two more risky stocks in PF-Jet & SunPharma....Lets see
2002 2019-03-12 04:53:51 Ì am of the opinion that the CDN oil stocks may present a once on a lifetime opportunity but it may take a bit longer to bring the buyers back  I have $BTE as  my top pick as it has 40% production in the Permian  Do you agree? What would be your top pick?

How's that robust stock market working 4 y'all? Wait, u don't have stocks

2006 2019-03-12 04:47:16 There are market cycles when 
 1. stocks with fundamentals 
2. stocks without fundamentals 

Both Go UP

Stick with quality! Focus on asset allocation. Do not get carried away!

2132 2019-03-12 03:08:23 I was referring to people that want debate to fit perfectly into their perceptions. “CX has to be about stocks!” “LD has to be about values!” “PF has to be about adaptation!” Etc
2133 2019-03-12 03:08:18 Oh man. Great question.

I have no idea (nor does anyone else) what'll give the best results over exactly 60 months.

Long term, I'd split an investment between US shares and ASX shares, either index ETFs/LICs (for a passive investment), or individual stocks.

2134 2019-03-12 03:08:13 Institutions need time to get rid of their stocks. So they keep it up until their next ER or other catalyst and then one fine say boom: Boeing goes to 155 in a month. Thats what happened to FB, GS. In the mean time, they will have their agents like cramer pimp it up for retails

2137 2019-03-12 03:06:04 HSI rallied overnight 1.3% with a step up. It seems like a retest of 2800 is more likely after all. From my analysis, some stocks show UTAD, others dont - mixed feelings.

2168 2019-03-12 02:33:19 I’m curious. How much stock does the trump family own related to the manufacturers of these military expenditures?

Since there was no authentic divesting of his stocks to a disinterested third party, I’m curious how much profit he’s set to gain on the backs of the US taxpayers.

2192 2019-03-12 02:16:03 I keep trying to imagine what he’s so afraid of. My guess is former heavy investment in Wall Street, pharma, military industrial stocks. Since he released (some of 2014,) I further guess he cashed it all out in 2013,

2244 2019-03-12 01:43:22 There's no particular reason to think that it would. Humans occupy a 'cultural niche' that involves very sophisticated theories of mind and complex cultural behaviours. Intellectual advances would be evolutionarily adaptive in such cases, and we'd expect them to spread.

2261 2019-03-12 01:34:20 Yo US weed stocks on heavy WATCH , WHY? 

We are the biggest consumers! 
There was a meeting in my city last Saturday on how to grow!  We are a farming state, marijuana market is spread like a wild fire and US farmers are ready
2262 2019-03-12 01:34:10 Trade deal? Who needs a trade deal. Markets rally into oblivion because two stocks got upgraded. Slowing growth. Brexit drama. No trade deal. - lets sweep those issues under the rug for now and go big. Insane.
2263 2019-03-12 01:32:30 Zerohedge blocked me for nothing. I think after i tweeted “buy stocks!” after one of their warning posts...Too bad.
2264 2019-03-12 01:32:13 Read the paper. He got his funding from a racist and eugenic organisation; by the time I wrote that paper, he was actually running it. (Then he transferred most of their money to his own organisation, which gives an indication of his general honesty... but is pretty funny.)
2265 2019-03-12 01:27:22 I wish I could post this $JCP chart. I admit, it's a really nice BRB play. But I have a personal rule about crappy stocks under $5. Trying to keep that off my feed.

2267 2019-03-12 01:26:48 I remember that storm very well. Farmers & ranchers did 2 things to help control snow after that storm. Tree windbreaks went up everywhere to protect farms and livestock from wind-driven snow. No-till farming leaves stubble and stocks to catch huge amounts of snow.

He used his Final Smash on me OFFSTAGE TWICE

I only beat him because I hit a B-air, he teched it, but couldn't recover with each of us on our last stocks

2272 2019-03-12 01:20:44 We did well on the Big McC Os trade (Large range day) McC Os @-96 now still over sold.$BA held down the $DJI but SPX & many stocks like AMZN APPL GOOGL race up.
2273 2019-03-12 01:20:42 Another thought on gold — as an asset class. Ben Graham wrote in “The Intelligent Investor” that he doesn’t understand why anyone would own gold as it had greatly underperformed stocks. Mind you, this was 1975. 5 years before one of gold’s greatest inflation-adjusted runs.
2274 2019-03-12 01:20:11 If my understanding is in any way correct...we are talking about the stocks of companies related somehow with BTS...even tho' is a privately held company, there are some share holders and also there are companies related to the boys via advertising and the likes...I think.

2280 2019-03-12 01:16:05 BUY STOCKS
2281 2019-03-12 01:15:36 From IBD Big Picture. 
"First, as long as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 stay above Friday's closing levels, investors can have reason to increase exposure to stocks.
Second, if the market is to be judged by its leading stocks, investors have reason to accumulate shares. "
2282 2019-03-12 01:14:29 you trade your junk items for points and buy PRIZE'S with the points. they can be really good like a free ffq-like thing/buy stocks at 10 instead of 15 for a year/higher bank interest/etc
2283 2019-03-12 01:14:23 We have significant archaeological and archaeogenetic evidence for interchange across continental boundaries over the entire period, along a number of corridors: across the Horn, in the Nile Valley and indeed across a Sahara that has been extremely variable through that time.
2284 2019-03-12 01:14:09 Husband is asking how is this possible if stocks related to BTS are not public? (He's and economist, I didn't know what to answer him nor how to search for that information. ?)

2286 2019-03-12 01:14:03 Stocks? Is bighit public?
2287 2019-03-12 01:14:00 Sir just to let u know there is a vast difference in Indian IT stocks and NASDAQ stocks .. NASDAQ stocks are basically product companies who develop the product and sell it to market where as most of Indian IT are just the service providers in business of selling human capital
2288 2019-03-12 01:13:41 anyone know if theres a site where u can check what the stocks todays pre market volume was?
or how bout some software that if i can select an area on a chart like from say 9:34 - 10:39 it will tell me how much volume was done in that time frame
2289 2019-03-12 01:13:25 Until bighit goes public (rn they are a private company) no one can buy bighit stocks. I heard they are planning to go public this year. If so, I'm buying everything!
2290 2019-03-12 01:12:20 Oh, that one's easy: I'm an archaeologist working in Africa. First, there was no sustained separation between African and non-African populations over the last 50 KYr. (You might note there's a lot of uncertainty about the OoA event's timing, if it was a single event.)

2299 2019-03-12 01:07:45 @ClayTrader25 Watching your video on E-Trade, great stuff. I'm new to stocks, do you have a good explanation to the candlesticks?
2300 2019-03-12 01:07:09 M&Emy on Stocks: Market fell within model parameters. But a new 2019 high for the SPX should be a bullish sign into summer. And that action would keep model seeking for major long-term peak. Until then macro looks week, but central bankers add sugar?

2308 2019-03-12 00:56:25 @MichaelPolanyi Norway, dumping $1 Trillion Oil and Gas Stocks from it's Pension Fund is a Very Bad decision. Norway will  reap the seeds of a Bad Judgement.
2309 2019-03-12 00:54:52 Who?
2310 2019-03-12 00:54:14 Are 'people of primarily West African descent in the New World' a 'race' (separate from West Africans, since the latter are not successful sprinters)? 

And you always need to be attentive to cultural elements here: are Lithuanians a 'race', because of their basketball success?
2311 2019-03-12 00:53:12 it's really ridiculous to sell good stocks at low valuations, i will ad to my portfolio, time will pay.
2312 2019-03-12 00:52:24 I actually have no problem with the idea that, in some cases, some aspects of a population's biological variation might make them disproportionately successful in some sport. But I'm always confused about what that has to do with 'race'. Are West Africans a 'race'? Are Kalenjin?
2313 2019-03-12 00:51:51 Ayam megi sooo much better than @silvermillion Mamee Cup stocks.
2314 2019-03-12 00:50:13 Investors short stocks if they expect the stock price to drop in the future. i.e. YG investors are expecting more shit to hit the fan.

2316 2019-03-12 00:49:08 How do people like this make 9M.  Oil and gas stocks are in the dumpster.  After salary and expenses. How do they do it?..Mitch McConnell 'inherited' his 13M.  I'm suspicious.
2317 2019-03-12 00:48:57 AOC wants to tax rich @ 70% & corporations @ 90%. Institutional investors & rich sell their stocks & go offshore. Market hits numbers like 1930. Businesses close. State & local governments go bust paying unemployment & welfare. No $ for cops of firefighters.Etc., #AlwaysRight
2318 2019-03-12 00:48:27 It is understandable tho if YGE really kicked out SR. I mean this time the case is way worse and complicated than his previous scandal. YGE still a business and they already take the hit in the business perspective (read: stocks plummeting).

2323 2019-03-12 00:45:28 A second issue here: is 'West African' a race, distinct from other races? Actually, this matters. Jon Entine, in _Taboo_ also claimed that all 'East Africans' were great marathoners, but when we look at the data, we see this is very much associated with particular ethnic groups..

2327 2019-03-12 00:42:55 ...By contrast, money put into stocks goes for productive investments. New wealth is created rather than existing wealth being redistributed after being taken as taxes...
2328 2019-03-12 00:42:29 'west African origin...' - do you know how many of those people are actually _West African_? None, right? So why is it that this 'genetics by race' only gets expressed outside the region where (many of) the ancestors of those people originated?

2342 2019-03-12 00:23:38 That is an easy solution. When you start it immediately goes into a high interest savings account that you cannot touch until [insert age], no matter what. Then the person can invest as they see fit (stocks, bonds, ETFs, etc.) or not.

It reminds me of crypto sometimes
