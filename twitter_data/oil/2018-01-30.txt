5 2018-01-30 23:59:47 Yet you allow the federal and provincial Gov't to ignore the Charter (not constitution) regarding C-14; you allow the AB govt to ignore SCC ruling for Carter instead restricting us under C-14. Your a hypocrite, b/c oil funds your govt. You re-wrote my Constitutional rights!

11 2018-01-30 23:59:17 Great news! Unfortunately, tar sands dilbit still threatens our Salish Sea and endangered Orcas. Unescorted articulated tug barges transport tar sands oil from the Trans-Mountain pipeline terminus in Burnaby BC to Tacoma about once per week. #NOKM
12 2018-01-30 23:59:17 seem to remember this scared the crap out of me as I had a bedroom with no radiator and a big red 2 bar electric fire  got rid of it and bought a oil filled radiator in the end though much safer 
13 2018-01-30 23:59:13 Got me some lavendar oil. 
14 2018-01-30 23:59:10 the truth is they are actually economic sanctions to  hurt Russia’s oil industry. Nothing to do with election interference
15 2018-01-30 23:59:10 Because we had no money and our owner sold oil and donated his money for the team. We will have fan money in 5 years flat. Just gotta build out popularity.

44 2018-01-30 23:58:26 similar to what we saw in early January...we can have $10+ in several key markets (incentivizing a lot of coal & oil burn + additional 1 bcfd LNG imports in NE ) while still having $3.20 HH #natgas I wanted another rally like 2014 too...but I don't think it is coming.
45 2018-01-30 23:58:18 A tow truck got mixed up on what car to tow so they started towing my car while I was paying for my oil change since it was right up front. And so I've never felt so traumatized.
46 2018-01-30 23:58:17 I made a deal with the #Republicans. When they finish draining the swamp I get %20 of the oil they find. #DrainTheSwamp #DeepState #RussianBot #ReleaseTheMemo #SOTU #Trump #MAGA
47 2018-01-30 23:57:50 HA how is that? WE already have lots of oil and prices go up?

56 2018-01-30 23:56:42 It’s certain things you can only get at the beauty supply/Chinese store. 

Idk anywhere else I can get a fly ass pair of shades, earrings or bandana in any color for the low (and/or Shea butter and argon oil) lol
57 2018-01-30 23:56:40 California may pay the most in local taxes, they certainly don't contribute to other states. The federal tax rates are the same in all fifty states. Poor red states will not be poor for long with regulations cut and the rebirth of our industry; oil and gas; etc. ;)

59 2018-01-30 23:56:31 Have you ever tried putting lavender or lemongrass essential oil on your pillow?!
60 2018-01-30 23:56:29 Must’ve been too busy “anointing yourselves with oil” ya hosers 
61 2018-01-30 23:56:26 slurps the oil up
62 2018-01-30 23:56:25 No need to brush. Just floss your teeth.
No need to mow. Just trim your lawn.
Don’t worry about gas. Just make sure your oil filter is clean.
63 2018-01-30 23:56:25 Opo.. knina pagkaligo q pinalagyan q ulit ng oil s ksama q it means amoy chinese oil aq 
64 2018-01-30 23:56:21 That's engine oil
65 2018-01-30 23:56:17 I know lots of people who’ve opened up their fireplaces because they can’t afford gas, oil or electric heating. Plus it’s helped to cure damp in their homes & they burn a lot of rubbish which would normally  cost to recycle 
66 2018-01-30 23:56:16 Oil falls for second day on stock market selloff, supply concerns  #Forex
67 2018-01-30 23:56:11 @Jakewim Tom Brady is a snake oil salesman.

69 2018-01-30 23:55:49 Russians pumping oil into our ports for first time ever with zero media coverage! WTF?
70 2018-01-30 23:55:37 PAALALA: Ayaw ninyo ibutang inyong used oil sa mug tapos itapad sa inyong ginainom na kape kay matingala na lang mo nganong iba na ang lasa sa inyong kape 
71 2018-01-30 23:55:33 Unbelievable eh. I'm a United fan, but out of all our rivals, I like Arsenal the most, they do things the right way and don't get bank rolled by Oil Daddies.
I hope things turn around soon.

75 2018-01-30 23:55:10 I def put coconut oil on my face tho lol never had any issues
76 2018-01-30 23:55:09 Coconut oil is better for moisturizing!!
77 2018-01-30 23:54:59 Which is odd because your oil content is higher than most of the gulf states.
78 2018-01-30 23:54:58 all i’ve ever really done is some kind of foaming face wash for the shower (brand negotiable, cheapies are fine with me) & Oil of Olay sensitive moisturizer. beyond that, it’s more about staying hydrated & not taking up habits that are bad for my skin & overall health.
79 2018-01-30 23:54:56 It seems to me that the #BC #Government is making up for the #SiteC announcement and acting like they don't support #industry by introducing new #oil #spill #regulations #KinderMorgan #bcpoli #NDP

5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over."
81 2018-01-30 23:54:47 I'm just gonna saute' it in an iron skillet with olive oil, fresh ground pepper & a lil salt. I keep the lid on so it also steams it a bit.
82 2018-01-30 23:54:47 has anyone had any experience (good or bad) with rosehip oil?

87 2018-01-30 23:53:58 Coconut oil does wonders for my skin so idk
88 2018-01-30 23:53:56 Twitter needs a "I laugh at you" button. "Unite Alberta"??? You have the nerve to say that after the cons screwed over your farmers? No, you keep spoiling the oil brats.

98 2018-01-30 23:52:33 The citizens of Vancouver have decided they prefer bicycles over cars. They no longer need Alberta Oil. Let's test that theory.
99 2018-01-30 23:52:25 I cannot describe the joy & contentment I felt when my mon would sit me down on the floor, sit behind me on a chair and oil/massage my scalp! never was there a more powerful bonding/connecting moment! #Memories
100 2018-01-30 23:52:24 no kidding! do they like choking? i 100% do not believe they water - pill big ole pills like fish oil.
101 2018-01-30 23:52:17 It's a fine theory. ..but completely baseless. Scots just happened to see the importance of the EU. Brexit hasn't stopped indyref2 , indyref2 has been approved by the Scottish parliament and you're right...without scottish oil underpinning uk debts , the uk will be much poorer.
102 2018-01-30 23:52:11 Happy to announce that @RepTedLieu @laurafriedman43 and @AsmRichardBloom will be joining us on Saturday to oppose offshore oil drilling in California! #protectthepacific
103 2018-01-30 23:51:35 Sunflower oil >> Coconut oil
104 2018-01-30 23:51:32 This wild hair growth oil is the truth, I’m about to start getting silk wraps again.
105 2018-01-30 23:51:19 "combat climate change and diversify"??? Is there anyone in the world retarded enough to listen to you? Diversity??? Holy crap, oil is all Alberta does.
106 2018-01-30 23:51:14 Infrastructure related CPEC debt is not included by State Bank in its numbers. increase in expenditures on machinery imports, net of oil is neutral. 
Overall imports are up by $10 Bill. Consumer-driven imports are driving Debt. Can be easily cut by $5Bill a year.  CRITICAL
107 2018-01-30 23:51:13 Coconut oil ain’t good for some people on their face 

Some people also buy refined $5 jars from the bbq section. Correct.
108 2018-01-30 23:51:13 Probably because it's one of a gazillion stories of obvious conflicts of interest. Don't forget Pruitt with the oil polluters, the drug czar with Big Pharma, Rick Perry hugging whomever he's hugging these days. So discouraging. Everyone is numb. And that's probably their goal.
109 2018-01-30 23:51:04 hmmm sounds more like spider mites. Give them a thorough cleaning in the shower and spray em down with neem oil. Also too much fertilizer can burn roots! Plants only need fertilizer during the growing season
110 2018-01-30 23:51:01 Try cinnamon oil!
111 2018-01-30 23:51:00 Coconut oil cleared my skin and made my hair grow x10. I’m sure the shit in stores ain’t official now a days though.
112 2018-01-30 23:50:38 dont trust any youtuber. Everything they say is for $$. I remember when they had girls putting coconut oil on everything...till their hair started breaking off from all that protein. #NaturalHair
113 2018-01-30 23:50:34 If the dreams of big oil , pipelines and it becomes the ( little Norway ) for arctic oil and gas becomes reality ...couple that with industrial rates for that industrial town ?? then his legacy is secured ( at least in his circle )
114 2018-01-30 23:50:19 I'm in beauty school, as an esthetician I work with skin, and we got taught that coconut oil is one of the worst things for ya skin
115 2018-01-30 23:50:18 let me get sm oil and start yh
116 2018-01-30 23:50:17 whats wrong w putting coconut oil on your face? I've been doing it my whole life.
117 2018-01-30 23:50:11 OK. Chega de olive oil por hoje!
118 2018-01-30 23:50:10 400 dollars on new tires 240 on new windshield and gonna need my oil changed. Man just love being an adult
119 2018-01-30 23:50:08 Gotta stop using coconut oil since it apparently clogs pores
120 2018-01-30 23:50:03 Last resort try Rose Oil, it sounds counterproductive but has reduced mine, which are genetic from both sides yay
121 2018-01-30 23:49:59 This lady in the taco shop talking about “is the pollo white meat? Or do you think the shrimp is better? Or do they cook it with a lot of oil?” Like why are you in a taco shop tryna be picky & healthy 
122 2018-01-30 23:49:58 Oh that's not really a problem if you don't use your car much. That always happens to me. My last sticker told me to change it in summer but i waited til winter's start because the oil was still good back then when i looked it up.
123 2018-01-30 23:49:47 light oil salt and pepp, roast 20 mins at 420. Then drizzle with balsamic glaze and a sprinkle of shredded Parmesan. Rest in oven a few minutes to melt
124 2018-01-30 23:49:37 Got my salt lamp for better sleepy times. Humidifier/oil diffuser comes in Thursday. Sleepy times is gonna be great!
125 2018-01-30 23:49:36 Right then. You've no barking idea what you're on about then.
126 2018-01-30 23:49:34 Vitamin E oil!!!!!

128 2018-01-30 23:49:23 1 good for sure him (oil), 1 bad on him (insured rate), violent crime down slightly probably him as well. The rest too soon to say.
129 2018-01-30 23:49:20 A lot would have to happen for me to close short oil $66, short gold $1365, short platinum $1030, Short Dow 26500.  a lot!!!
130 2018-01-30 23:49:20 abdominal attack for 3 hours. ALMOST visited the hospital. thank God for the turmeric & virgin oil
131 2018-01-30 23:49:16 We were talking about what "we" (as in the western world if you like) have done.
You see her dad was a geologist and one of those who went out to the middle east to find oil...
She was in boarding school by about 5...
132 2018-01-30 23:49:15 who was even telling y’all to use coconut oil on your face? most things that are made for your skin shouldn’t be used for your face too

136 2018-01-30 23:48:56 sorry, didn't mean for a six-foot-high photo of the coconut oil
137 2018-01-30 23:48:55 would love that. so much snake oil out there in terms. Just some basic sleep monitoring and claim way of waking up (read alarm my wife won't be bothered by).
138 2018-01-30 23:48:44 He has as much of a chance of uniting as oil and water! He and his GOP goons have undermined the trust of the American people beyond measure. He is afraid of Putin, seems that he owes more to the Russians than he's able to extend to the nation of which they put him in charge of!
139 2018-01-30 23:48:22 放送が聞こえようと聞こえまいと点数変わらないから
140 2018-01-30 23:48:00 Also a hell of a lot cheaper than oil, gas or electricity

153 2018-01-30 23:46:48 Ooooo, I hope he brings the vanilla-scented oil
154 2018-01-30 23:46:47 And then follow the money to big oil and  Russia.
155 2018-01-30 23:46:36 brendon put too much oil of oregano in his smoothie once and was sick for days!!! lmao
156 2018-01-30 23:46:23 Nothing like taking hot motor oil to the face first day at work
157 2018-01-30 23:46:18 What’s the medium? I pad ,acrylics on canvas,   oil on canvas ???
158 2018-01-30 23:46:18 Hi Kerry,

159 2018-01-30 23:46:10 Clean coal is an oxymoron. You have ended all progress to reduce pollution and create clean energy sources, all for the almighty dollar from coal and oil producers.
160 2018-01-30 23:46:09 And how much oil was spilled...? 210,000 from Keystone? Great! 
161 2018-01-30 23:46:00 Hard agree Bourree! I'm now on the other end of the wormhole where I am trying to reduce my entire beauty regime (everything everything) to coconut oil, dr bronner's and a good night serum. Taking recs for that one.
162 2018-01-30 23:45:43 Um, yes half of my family lives in Alberta working in oil and gas . But fair enough, it is an over generalization but not completely off the mark. I do know which is why I don't eat many avocados but I enjoy them in emoji form, I guess it's just the 'ironic hipster' in me 
163 2018-01-30 23:45:42 LADWP (and maybe some of the buildings that hide oil wells in/around LA?) is exactly what came to mind!
164 2018-01-30 23:45:37 We are not İran. Do not forget please İran stolen Kerkuk oil from Turkmens. We're not İran because We're not invasion south Azerbaijan !
165 2018-01-30 23:45:36 OK pause tf . coconut oil did NOT fuck my face up . it made it better . sorry y’all had a sad experience but it worked for me
166 2018-01-30 23:45:35 I gotta come in soon guys. Need my oil changed! See you guys within the month!
167 2018-01-30 23:45:33 Come on down to the beach the Oil is fine and I got a loaded nine 
168 2018-01-30 23:45:31 Try booty meat oil
169 2018-01-30 23:45:25 ฝนตก — feeling bored
170 2018-01-30 23:45:23 Oil price collapsed today. Trump has Putin oil and gas envy and thinks it's a macho industry as opposed to the feminine solar industry.
171 2018-01-30 23:45:22 coconut oil is the best thing i’ve ever added into my skin routine y’all are ugly for disagreeing
172 2018-01-30 23:45:19 The sun controls the climate , not oil burning.
173 2018-01-30 23:45:19 Did it cost more than the BP Oil spill? Lol
174 2018-01-30 23:45:04 Yup, I'm buying elderberry oil for candles... the theme is Monty Pyton. Can you guess what I'm going to name this blend?  (These candles will go with me to #geekcraftexpo in March.)
175 2018-01-30 23:44:48 あいらぶゆーらぶゆーゆあゆー！
176 2018-01-30 23:44:47 @maxkellerman is such a liberal nutjob
177 2018-01-30 23:44:44 Original. “History meh who cares” meanwhile you lot act like football ends this May. You may be the better team right now, but form (and Arabic oil) is temporary, class, prestige and winning mentality is permanent. You’re just a small club, United is special and won’t go away.
178 2018-01-30 23:44:33 Gotta use body oil. Keep you moisturized all day. Lotion is for the summer lol
179 2018-01-30 23:44:29 Tribalism in Kenya is so toxic & contagious that few foreign firms escape infection. Yellow Oil is hardly ten years in Kenya & it's already a Mount Kenya province. KPMG did an Uthamaki audit of IEBC even helping to conceal the findings.
180 2018-01-30 23:44:23 I worship vitamin e oil lol i use it for everything. It’s such a smooth “non oily” oil. I bought mine at Walmart in the vitamin section. It’s like $5 a bottle.
181 2018-01-30 23:44:15 Y’all not mad at coconut oil, y’all buying the shit from Walmart that’s why it made you break out. Lol
182 2018-01-30 23:44:00 A history of colonial exploitation, right-wing violence and sabotage, conservative military control of the food economy, soft power undermining / coup sponsoring by the US, and of course basic incompetence and the price of oil.
183 2018-01-30 23:43:58 眠すぎて片目閉じながらガッコーきた
184 2018-01-30 23:43:52 Fresh oil change and I’m feeling like a bad bitch
185 2018-01-30 23:43:41 Canada’s Gay friendly Oilsands at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that throw our  off buildings. Protesting Kinder Morgan = killing #LGBTQ
186 2018-01-30 23:43:31 It's the sun that controls the climate not oil burning or drilling.
187 2018-01-30 23:43:30 I remember solid mechanics level 2 m=2j-3
188 2018-01-30 23:43:27 Oil change 
189 2018-01-30 23:43:26 @cranksgameplays @space_nestor kettle corn isn’t caramel corn. It just has sugar, salt and oil on it. Caramel corn is different.
190 2018-01-30 23:43:19 That’s awesome! I tried charcoal but it left my skin feeling weird! But that’s awesome! I’m going to look into the vitamin e oil!
191 2018-01-30 23:43:12 hmmm coconut oil?
192 2018-01-30 23:43:09 Our job is to build a gallery and a Mustard oil that works for everyone.
193 2018-01-30 23:42:53 The gig is up Seth. Time to go back to selling snake oil out of the back of a wagon.
194 2018-01-30 23:42:51 The lefty snake oil will surely have extra viscosity tonite. Can’t wait for the live tweet.
195 2018-01-30 23:42:44 “Don’t get it twisted sis, I wake up every morning to a head scarf and coconut oil. I’m married to a black queen” 
-Randall Pearson

sis you deserve a Randall in your life.
196 2018-01-30 23:42:36 Whoever said to put coconut oil on ur face is a damned lie ... never again
197 2018-01-30 23:42:16 We were all duped by the American greed for Oil. TB is no doubt complicit in war crimes. He is now not in office. I believe the #Labour way is the best for all in the future. The past is history. JC is just a small part in a bigger movement.
198 2018-01-30 23:42:15 I shop in Linden because it's close to the oil refinery and the food tastes like an oil refinery, which I love
199 2018-01-30 23:42:15 *Hands her a plate, a silver spoon, a glass phial of chilli oil, and a silver salver with chopped devil's tongue chills.* Please—help yourself.
200 2018-01-30 23:42:11 The worst part is, he's totally ruining his legacy. How I met Your Mother was an awesome series. I'm glad NPH didn't turn into a snake oil salesman.
201 2018-01-30 23:42:06 Please call this Racist Russian Plant for what he is ! A #FakePresident Agent Of Putin’s A Criminal Mobster Who’s doing Putin’s bidding in America Opening the drilling of the Arctic and removal of all regulatory efforts that impede Oil Conglomerates! No State Department! Treason
202 2018-01-30 23:41:57 Same. Soap dries my face out way too much. I tried e.l.f. face wash and it actually did cause breakouts. Now I use a charcoal and clay face wash and I use plain vitamin E oil as a moisturizer and my face is doing so much better and actually glows lol
203 2018-01-30 23:41:43 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
204 2018-01-30 23:41:29 第一文型:石油価格は変動する。
Oil prices change.
205 2018-01-30 23:41:21 Yes Afghanistan has huge amounts of natural resources maybe not oil but mineral deposits instead. The opium trade is gigantic!
206 2018-01-30 23:41:09 Just bought a bottle of baby oil gel and I wanna get my dick wet in it
207 2018-01-30 23:40:55 Just ate a whole bag of Kettle Brand chips cooked in avocado oil. It’s kinda like avocado toast, so that makes me a hip millennia imo...
208 2018-01-30 23:40:52 John West Tuna Chunks insunflower oil,  brine and spring water #NationalPuzzleDay
209 2018-01-30 23:40:32 Why do random house mates cook stupid meals at this time? Anything that involves frying and lots of oil.
210 2018-01-30 23:40:30 but on the real I saw an episode of Chopped where a competitor had gone blind from a previous incident where oil popped in his eye 
211 2018-01-30 23:40:29 Ive got that logo tattooed on my arm. I hope they dont change it. If they do I guess I could make it work. Add the new one and the oil derrik
212 2018-01-30 23:40:26 It's only money, and what's money? Nothing, paper, back by nothing, Or if you want to believe oil.
There's a reason everybody went off the gold standard in 1933, and Nixon wielded the final blow in 1971.
It was simply done so that political, military etc. etc can spend w/no limit
213 2018-01-30 23:40:23 たらこって美味いよな！
214 2018-01-30 23:40:18 Oil money buys you seats at the best tables.
215 2018-01-30 23:40:13 The point of the post is that the oil was toxic and you kept talking about how it was because it wasn’t the brand you like, when I’m arguing that it’s not because she wasn’t using YL, it’s because most 100% oils are toxic- even YL “animal” line is hella diluted
216 2018-01-30 23:40:09 僕はただ油にこんにちはを言う練習をする。
217 2018-01-30 23:39:50 Definitely would not live in an area where people feel compelled to dress their kindergarten-aged kids like oil rig workers. 
218 2018-01-30 23:39:46 Ian your buffoonery now warrants legendary status - congratulations you're up there with the best!!  your party has refused to table any economic impact  of indy on the Scottish economy - is the 8Billion from oil and 180m seperation costs from the lord of buffoonery still good?
219 2018-01-30 23:39:39 Seriously?? I’ve always been told it’s peanut oil.
220 2018-01-30 23:39:39 just put vichy water in my essential oil diffuser
221 2018-01-30 23:39:36 That's why Danny is a villain isn't it? A) Muskrat B) bloated the civil service when oil money was flowing. So can you have Danny and support NAPE at same time? Lol. Now I've started it ;-)
222 2018-01-30 23:39:35 Since when are pipelines that transport Canadian oil across land that should be protected,  so it can be sold to other countries,  "infrastructure"?
223 2018-01-30 23:39:34 OIL CHANGE SPECIALS!!!
$19.95
We will top off the fluids and change up to 5 quarts of oil and filter on most makes and models (excludes diesels)!!! 
Call to set up a time to come in or just stop on in!! 
251-867-0506
224 2018-01-30 23:39:24 The part that you have never gotten is that "protecting the public good" isn't YOUR ideology - it is everyone's collectively.
And  far & away supports this pipeline, which has already shown itself to be in the public interest
But thanks for taking AB oil $ while you were here
225 2018-01-30 23:39:24 Why is this precedent? Every other country that has oil lines crosses provincial boundaries to tidal water. It’s a non issue. Does it matter that the oil is from “Alberta”?
226 2018-01-30 23:39:19 This can work with a limited scope and support of specific hardware. @Apstra is doing this well and fairly represents their products, the rest of the industry seems to be selling snake oil. Orchestration is good, but universal modeling is a pipe dream.
227 2018-01-30 23:39:18 You can ride a bike to work and still invest in oil.
228 2018-01-30 23:39:04 But... you typed oil not oiI.

...

I trusted u...
229 2018-01-30 23:38:54 Getting made fun of for using coconut oil in my pasta.
230 2018-01-30 23:38:53 i need an oil city friend so i can have a valid excuse for going to the villa at least 3 days a week

DMs are open, i’ll pay for your shake
231 2018-01-30 23:38:49 No one is blocking Alberta oil?? Your province and her citizens are doing everything they CAN to block Alberta oil.
232 2018-01-30 23:38:32 Rosehip oil and Vitamin E oil have actually changed my life. Skin feeling smoother than a baby
233 2018-01-30 23:38:18 NO nuclear waste petroleum oil gas drilling mining pipelines coal fossil fuels which are dirty however please engage solar wind geothermal landfill-methane electromagnetic and many more environmental ecology engineering energies investments as foremost @WhiteHouse
234 2018-01-30 23:38:07 My essential oil diffuser and salt lamp came today and I am so obsessed already.
235 2018-01-30 23:37:59 I only normally use coconut oil for my hair is that bad? Lol I never used it for my skin unless I used it for tanning
236 2018-01-30 23:37:54 Once i get my oil changed its over for you priuses
237 2018-01-30 23:37:33 Continues to destroy our lands.  NODAPL. No oil.

239 2018-01-30 23:37:21 I feel my best covered in coconut oil
240 2018-01-30 23:37:13 oil my scalp & I’ll love you forever. Don’t nothing scream love like making sure your baby is moisturized 
241 2018-01-30 23:37:04 only some oils are toxic and some are okay. Tea tree oil is the most toxic and should be kept away from your pets at all costs.
242 2018-01-30 23:37:03 That was back in 2016. Oil now looking more positive and with the likes of Sanjeev Gupta recognising the Scottish Government as being in a whole different league when compared to the UK, I think we should take the chance. At least we wouldn't be offsetting dire Tory policy.
243 2018-01-30 23:36:56 Biotin oil, but yes the wonderful joy of motherhood!
244 2018-01-30 23:36:56 Chevron historically chose not to commit to the line as a business decision possibly so could use their own crude product supplied by rail. There is no reason to believe Parklands will follow that trend if cheap oil is available by pipeline
245 2018-01-30 23:36:45 Then after washing my face, I use witch hazel as a toner, spray the Mario rose water, and moisturize with argan oil. I do it every single day and it has made my skin amazing
246 2018-01-30 23:36:35 Shitty movie descriptions 2 or make up movie plots like snake oil and see if the other person would see it
247 2018-01-30 23:36:22 Protect it, don't let the oil and gas companies get it.

249 2018-01-30 23:36:12 Olive oil removes eye makeup and it helps strengthen and moisturize lashes
250 2018-01-30 23:36:09 So there are oil wells, connected to pipelines, connected to larger pipelines, which go to refineries, all within BC. All within BC. Should BC shut those down? They’re in “your backyard”. Or is there a complete lack of knowledge, or is it a double standard?
251 2018-01-30 23:36:03 Holy moly!! Just bought some Brigham Paul Revere's Rocky Road. The 'contains' section says milk/soy. The ingredient list says it contains PEANUT OIL. WTAF! Boy is severely allergic to peanuts! Wow. Do better!
252 2018-01-30 23:36:01 Spicy as in chillies? I have a smoked chilli oil which might compliment the silky texture of the cerebellum...
253 2018-01-30 23:36:01 People going crazy in the comments..I guess its all of the oil, I hope they never have to see deconstructed salad dressing  bitches think they eating healthy
254 2018-01-30 23:35:40 So you cherry pick numbers and try to sell snake oil.

257 2018-01-30 23:35:23 Why does it take 2 hours for an oil change?
258 2018-01-30 23:35:16 this almond & lavender oil mix ya girl just whipped up with added glitter shimmer >>>>>>>
259 2018-01-30 23:35:09 About time! Let's stop this pipeline once and for all. Let the world know Canadians will stand up to big oil.
260 2018-01-30 23:34:59 Oh. And before OPEC or any perma-bull loon you run into #OOTT starts with the "5 year average" garbage, know that it's just a narrative. Fans of math know that the huge spikes the last 5 years distort that average. Yearly averages are better #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #OPEC #CL_F
261 2018-01-30 23:34:05 "Someone's started to put oil palm in" - remember when this was sold as 'green alternative'? Now we see it for what it is; a vector of genocide ('In Search of the Lost Girl', BBC2).
262 2018-01-30 23:33:36 You wanna know how hard I am? 

I topped off a batch of Olive pickle with canola oil instead of Olive oil just because my family had the Olive oil with them and I hate asking people for favors.


263 2018-01-30 23:33:21 @wjrradio The Walmart in Fayetteville, NC has Oil of Olay products, razors, and baby formula locked down.  Products are locked down because they are being stolen.  This has nothing to do with race.

267 2018-01-30 23:33:04 We need to ween ourselves off oil dependence and Trump has not been supportive of green autos or green anything, we can’t destroy all of our coastlines and some of our oil reserves require fracking and other damaging higher cost extractions
268 2018-01-30 23:32:53 You got the baby oil?
269 2018-01-30 23:32:49 Healing crystals also and get an oil diffuser
270 2018-01-30 23:32:44 Right. The dollar is weakening = higher prices. Which I'm certainly seeing in PA & is regressive against low income people. My issue is that RU wants sanctions lifted & needs oil to get back into triple digits so they can live in the manner to which they've become accustomed.
271 2018-01-30 23:32:42 Omggg fuck coconut oil literally the ugliest of all the oils

274 2018-01-30 23:32:26 oil prices are up, Russia gets to sell new planes etc, and on testing medication before prescribing it to pregnant women, etc.

276 2018-01-30 23:32:14 Maggie should know; she usedScotland's oil to pay for London infrastructure.
277 2018-01-30 23:32:10 Iran ? Women get a great deal there (ok Iran not Arab but borderline) The emirates ? (Not talking arsenal) and as for Saudi they’re ok as we need the oil.
278 2018-01-30 23:31:59 I tried to go get my car oil changed and the mechanic said I didn't need one yet. Despite what the sticker said... This is the 2nd time THEY put a mileage number for me to come back on and it was too early...dafuq. .___.

280 2018-01-30 23:31:54 My roommate cooks with fish oil then eats in our 2x4 tiny dorm. Needless to say it smells like a fishing boat in here.
281 2018-01-30 23:31:50 African black soap daily, st ives apricot scrub every few days and argan oil daily is what works best for me
282 2018-01-30 23:31:50 Yikes must be the oil effect.
283 2018-01-30 23:31:45 How can she even be surprised? It's okay for the NDP to impose moral limitations on oil exports in Alberta, however when they do the same thing in BC it's unbelievable? @RachelNotley sit down.

287 2018-01-30 23:31:23 Ouch. Olive oil isn't ideal but it's thick enough to form a barrier. Jojoba is better & pretty cheap.
288 2018-01-30 23:31:17 Lead your province away from banking on your land locked oil. We aren’t letting this pipeline through. It’s not a resource if it’s stuck in the ground with no market.
289 2018-01-30 23:31:13 I wonder if it’s only toxic consumed through nasal membranes? Bc I have a natural flee spray for my pupper that you spray on them and it has tea tree oil and cinnamon so I’m v confused now. I know she hates the spray but I hope it’s not harming her :(

294 2018-01-30 23:31:01 because it usually is.  not saying that tea tree oil is good. but, ik for a fact that certain YL oils are great for animals
295 2018-01-30 23:30:55 I already can’t find CBD oil anywhere for my dog and I am literally so annoyed.
296 2018-01-30 23:30:45 work, haircut, gym, oil change, grocerys, laundry, cleaned the crib. now time to play ball, then drinks and dinner.. productive little tuesday for cal
297 2018-01-30 23:30:42 The motor in my fan really needs oil but it kind of sounds like a lightsaber so... is that a good enough reason not to be an adult and fix it? Not that I’m asking. I’m pretty sure it is.

303 2018-01-30 23:30:01 Why haven’t I used coconut oil to remove my makeup before or generally use on my skin, it’s fucking amazing 
304 2018-01-30 23:29:48 Currently Puget Sound gets most of  its oil by tanker. Historic averages were about 500,000 bbl/day. Much of that can be supplied via Sumas pipeline on expanded TMX. Given total volume of TMX, no way that we exceed 500,000 bbl/d by tanker to California and Asia.
305 2018-01-30 23:29:46 Okay ! I get of class at 1:20 I’ll link with y’all after.. you can come with me to get oil change if you want.. I don’t got shit to do and @monaealexiss you’ll be working out with us
306 2018-01-30 23:29:41 Thanks for sharing this!i can only find sunflower oil here in my place tho
307 2018-01-30 23:29:31 Where would I find the information showing the reduction in oil-by-rail shipments? "Trust, but verify."
308 2018-01-30 23:29:26 Don’t forget to include information on how the US, once again did not #HonorTheTreaty with a Sovereign nation in it’s push for more oil. Also, how many times has ETP caused environmental damage already? Ask Ohio.
309 2018-01-30 23:29:24 Lmao yeah that’s why you replied like 5 difference times telling ppl it was just the wrong type of oil trying to promote YL after she DID do her own research on it  okay then

311 2018-01-30 23:29:17 Annual Oil usage per person in #Canada is 6519 kilos @JustinTrudeau  Japan is 3177 kilos. Germany is 3260 kilos. All of North American Industrial Energy waste is at 75%. Carbon tax is only a bandaid solution. Solar energy would solve the fossil fuel crisis. Solar on homes ...
312 2018-01-30 23:29:12 Saaame, I used to use it on my face and got deep cysts. years later i tried a product with coconut oil in it, same shit.
313 2018-01-30 23:29:11 I've also just spent the last three-odd weeks testing as many products as possible for a beauty awards roundup. My face felt so fucked up I've literally slathered straight olive oil all over it (feels better, looks good, no breakouts)
314 2018-01-30 23:29:11 Maddening that most Scots fell for all the lies about the oil reserves and value in 2014. For God’s sake don’t be fooled this time when all their lies appear again.
315 2018-01-30 23:29:09 Nope, that and then some will be going into the gas tank with these skyrocketing gas prices. Guess all the red tape cutting is allowing big oil to increase their already insane amount of profit.

320 2018-01-30 23:28:41 Our POTUS thinks America's infrastructure is oil pipelines.

What about replacing aging lead water pipes in thousands of our older communities, or rebuilding our crumbling dams, schools, bridges and roads. There are still some areas of America that don't even have electricity
321 2018-01-30 23:28:30 I need an oil change 
322 2018-01-30 23:28:26 kinda like relying on a outdated source of energy like oil, in a world that is moving away from fossil fuels and into renewable energy? kinda like that???

327 2018-01-30 23:28:11 there aren't that many jobs created by #KinderMorgan tripling - not enough to risk a #Tarsands bitumen oil spill on B.C. coast that can't be cleaned up and will put 1000s out of work. (And a chat with @jjhorgan won't help you either.) #NoTankers #NoPipelines #ableg #bcpoli

332 2018-01-30 23:27:43 So oil companies can sell the oil overseas
333 2018-01-30 23:27:29 brownie mix but instead of making it with oil, eggs and water just use a can of pumpkin. You’ll thank me later.
334 2018-01-30 23:27:20 Have you investigated the possibility of working on oil rigs?!
335 2018-01-30 23:27:19 Just bought Avocado Oil and Shea Butter shampoo and Shea Butter lotion plus I have my Coffee Coconut scrub? When I get home and bathe it is over for all of you.
336 2018-01-30 23:27:12 whew, girl. I weep for your skin. Don't ever put baking soda or salt or coconut oil on your face again.
337 2018-01-30 23:27:06 So will only need to find 11.5m b/d from elsewhere by then, considering that at the current rate demand goes up by 10-12m b/d over the same time period. With 3% compounded annual decline thrown in, we are really short smth like 37-40m b/d by then. Swimming in oil!
338 2018-01-30 23:27:06 2018 will not be too kind for you troll. Crude build or not tomorrow, we know how oil will drop. Now run along and tell tsxman to use better fake accounts to troll away.
339 2018-01-30 23:26:54 got my oil changed for free ain’t God good? 
340 2018-01-30 23:26:54 Just for the record LOL I never had clear skin and all products made my skin worst.. and for coconut oil use.. I’m allergic to try again

345 2018-01-30 23:26:36 when I first started taking my skin care seriously i didn’t know better and used coconut oil. We love progress!!!

350 2018-01-30 23:26:22 Trump did NOT improve the infrastructure. Hushed up was the fact that soon after he touted the XL pipeline, it sprang a huge leak and gushed huge quantities of oil onto Western lands.
351 2018-01-30 23:26:10 which essential oil will help me get my sh!t together
352 2018-01-30 23:26:09 So what. How rich do you want to be?
9% max over 15 years may be fast to a fat bloke but its negligible to the rest of us. The fluctuations in the price of oil will have a bigger impact.
353 2018-01-30 23:26:09 I am low on garlic AND olive oil. #AndreasHouseholdEmergencies

359 2018-01-30 23:25:42 It solves to many problems, to cheap, ends need for oil, gas, wars over it. When you create a world economy are betrayed its easy to destroy it. For a better one . Morons.
360 2018-01-30 23:25:39 How is allowing oil companies to dig up protected lands and defile drinking water helping? Any jobs "created" by allowing the construction will dry up when it is completed. What about Bridges and roads?

365 2018-01-30 23:25:27 Coconut oil broke my skin out to the point I had to go to the doctor.

I honestly don’t listen to much of what Twitter says when it comes to skincare after that. I’ll keep doing what I’ve been doing.
366 2018-01-30 23:25:17 hmm, I don't have pimples, just a persistent layer of oil

378 2018-01-30 23:24:20 The price of gas vs. # of days in office wasn't my point but the idea that a President has no impact on the price of gasoline seems disingenuous.
Especially one w/ a vested interest in raising the price of a BBL of oil to satisfy ppl who make money from that circumstance.

384 2018-01-30 23:23:43 Two degrees in what? Not al degrees are created equal.  Degrees are expensive and universities will sell anything unsuspecting students will buy,regardless of career prospects, if you think oil companies are bad. Pry open the business of running a university.

389 2018-01-30 23:23:00 No one is blocking Albertan oil, but there is no way a 300% increase in tanker traffic is gonna fly. Alberta will have to help Tarsands company's come up with more moderate proposals.
390 2018-01-30 23:22:49 Try Queen Helen Cholestrol deep conditioner maybe mix in other oils like Castro oil or olive oil to help.

391 2018-01-30 23:22:44 Because oil is the energy of the future. Besides coal, that is.
392 2018-01-30 23:22:25 They're a lot nicer to look at than oil wells.
393 2018-01-30 23:21:58 Actually people outside Alberta are also mad as you r at how the oil industry has been treated by the Trudeau Goverment and your NDP socialists!
394 2018-01-30 23:21:53 How about a fetish for imagining mountains of oil spills under cars, wow! My fave!
395 2018-01-30 23:21:52 With CFTC numbers last week hitting over 710K net speculative crude oil longs, we now have an abundance of “weak longs” in the commodity. As WTI approaches $63, these positions will continue to panic and eventually collapse. $USO #OOTT

400 2018-01-30 23:21:25 that's fine. It isn't ascorbic acid. This one seems oil based, just make sure to wear sunscreen. What brand is it?
401 2018-01-30 23:21:22 What Policies are you referring to? Alberta is in a recession, and our economy was almost purely reliant on high oil prices, that is why people are hurting. The NDP did not cause the sky to fall. Their policies are diversifying our economy, not hurting it.
402 2018-01-30 23:21:19 It's interesting that you're more than happy to accept the benefits that are derived from oil revenue for Canada and yet are not willing to do your part in bringing prosperity to the country and the social benefits it pays for that help all people. #ablef #cdnpoli
403 2018-01-30 23:21:14 Wow, @thriveselling, it is great to find something we disagree on!!  I’m not an expert but my sense is that the enhanced infrastructure would make the movement of oil safer notwithstanding increased volume and would also call for dramatically improved spill prevention and respons
404 2018-01-30 23:21:11 In your face move by dems. Illegals matter more than citizens and not a damn thing you can do about it.
405 2018-01-30 23:21:06 I’m so glad my son talked to me. 2 yrs we battled together. Then he discovered CBD oil in June. He is almost ‘normal’ again, he feels lifted from severe & suicidal, right up to Mild/fine. I hope it continues, I’m desperate for him to be well, and feel happiness. Xxx
406 2018-01-30 23:21:03 There is this very professional man sitting beside me at Starbucks talking about the oil industry and how much money he's made. I'm over here checking my tinder matches and thinking about how many more brushes I can get out of my toothpaste bottle.
407 2018-01-30 23:20:49 Wow that’s an over generalization if I’ve ever seen one.  Have you met anyone who works in oil and gas? Or is that just your hipster opinion? Do you know the damage avocados do to our environment?
408 2018-01-30 23:20:47 And how long did it take the sting age to end?  What are we 140 some years into the oil age having to dig up sand and wash the oil off and collect it.  Can’t do that long term at 65 bucks.
409 2018-01-30 23:20:45 Y’all just now realizing that coconut oil is a sealant and not a moisturizer and now y’all hate it. Stupid

415 2018-01-30 23:19:47 @LindseyGrahamSC It is critical to our national security interests as well as the tourism-driven economy of South Carolina for the Atlantic waters off the coast of South Carolina to remain closed to oil drilling.

438 2018-01-30 23:17:50 I guess we'll have to let the courts determine it. BC simply can't allow Vancouver to be turned into an oil port. Vancouver economic driver, tourism, depends on a clean Howe Sound and Burrard Inlet.

443 2018-01-30 23:17:25 I use a face oil, but I feel like it just puts a layer of oil on top of my skin and doesn’t really soak in..
444 2018-01-30 23:17:21 Men constantly look for a cheaper way to go to Heaven. The world is full of snake oil salesmen who will sell them a cheaper way. It's bogus
445 2018-01-30 23:17:12 @hardball Does not renewing the sanctions mean that Exxon can go into Russia for the 500 billion dollars worth of oil ?
446 2018-01-30 23:17:11 Yeah, proprietary roads were a big thing back then.  Esso's 'Skate 'n' Skid Oil Time Slalom' roads were responsible for the most deaths of 1984.
447 2018-01-30 23:17:06 But with all this oil money coming back to the USA, how will Saudi Arabia be able to fund its position as the global #1 sponsor of terrorism AND pay for the media to tell you Iran is the bad guy?
448 2018-01-30 23:17:03 Hooray got oil
Furnace now running
Thermostat read 46 in here when got home
449 2018-01-30 23:16:59 I swear they take their sweet time for a simple oil change 
450 2018-01-30 23:16:58 @AnciraWinton crazy y’all doubled oil changes, $60. Then want to charge me $70 to replace my cabin air filter. I ended up doing the air filter myself for $8.00
451 2018-01-30 23:16:57 Remember: If you’re not swimming to work around rubble of collapsed bridges in rivers of crude oil sludge the GDP isn’t big enough yet. #business
452 2018-01-30 23:16:51 Qué se preocupe  Salinas y sus prestanombres ( Sierra Oil & Gas ) porque a los mexicanos desde cuando nos despojaron de él y de casí todos los recursos naturales.
A los mexicanxs no nos volveran a engañar.
AMLO presidente!
453 2018-01-30 23:16:46 There's no way Vancouver will be turned into an oil port. Its simply not happening. I am a moderate on the issue- I would have accepted an reasonable increase in pipeline size and tanker traffic for a new state of the art pipeline. However its too much for this harbour.
454 2018-01-30 23:16:35 Vitamin e oil or any type of face oil, don’t use cleansers with any alcohol. I use this face cream by Eucerin and loveeee it
455 2018-01-30 23:16:35 They can pry my hyaluronic serum, face oil, and sheet masks out of my cold, dead, moisturized hands
456 2018-01-30 23:16:30 I buy the non-psychoactive cbd chews because I cannot ski high and I need the healing of the cannabis oil for chronic painti be able to ski like an animal. Shit is magical really

460 2018-01-30 23:16:13 Yes!.conflicts between indigenous landowners, community shareholders, oil companies, government, insurgency groups, environmental protection issues, legal misinterpretations and misrepresentation of legal proceedings concerning the region, etc! That's what I mean by instability.

468 2018-01-30 23:15:29 Not true. CBD oil is legal in Tx with following the proper procedures. Made in/near Austin ironically.
469 2018-01-30 23:15:25 Whats the stock market gotta do with it? Most clubs have stocks...thats how companies work. All of United’s money is from sponsors that they attracted through winning and having fans, your club’s foundation is literally exploited Arabic oil. Shut up and stay in your lane, clown.
470 2018-01-30 23:15:22 I have had Five Guys 5 out of the past 7 days. I straight up pee oil now
471 2018-01-30 23:15:03 Royalties from increased oil prices to fund renewables research and development perhaps?
472 2018-01-30 23:15:02 Tillerson is hoping for a cushy oil exec job from Putin when Rex quits the White House. Wife wants more money.
473 2018-01-30 23:14:58 What a load of crap. Nothing to do with the tax bill..everything to do with the pro oil, anti clean energy policies of this administration. Oil companies invest and make more profits that they won’t share with workers and our grandchildren pay dearly for a destroyed environment

483 2018-01-30 23:14:03 250 dollars for a got damn oil change
484 2018-01-30 23:14:01 That's scene from Chappelle's show, Black Bush, talking about oil 
485 2018-01-30 23:13:48 When #Trump announced that he would #allow #offshore #oil and #gas #drilling on the #East and #West #Coasts #remember that the #Koch #Brothers #were #controlling his #mouth, #voice and #pen and they are the #main #beneficiaries.
486 2018-01-30 23:13:33 Interesting. Wonder how this plays out for imports of gasoline/diesel into #Mexico -- Mexico's state-run oil company Pemex expects to increase crude processing at its refineries to some 900,000 bpd by Q2, from current volumes of slightly above 500,000 bpd, CEO Carlos Trevino said

488 2018-01-30 23:13:21 Or maybe he’ll tell u how GDP and markets r up unemployment down oil exports up. Tax relief etc. but don’t let facts get in ur way
489 2018-01-30 23:13:19 Oh geez here he is again.  Doesn’t matter if oil is up or down always heading down with this guy.  Hint here crude will show another drop tomorrow and crush your seasonal sentiment based short rally.
490 2018-01-30 23:13:14 Including you?
491 2018-01-30 23:13:06 I took a bath with lavender oil and my idiotic kitten wouldn't stop drinking the water so RIP to her
492 2018-01-30 23:13:05 Lmaooo y’all switch up so fast on Twitter every year. Last year coconut oil was life, now y’all hate ppl who use it.
493 2018-01-30 23:12:46 not enoughold enuf to remember acid rain..NY fog was smog..I choked..oil spills..fracking & affects on soil...pesticides & affect on health...all coming back. Enjoy 
494 2018-01-30 23:12:35 Wow I’m about to attempt to put oil in my car 
495 2018-01-30 23:12:34 @JennaJulien You guys should create a game where you take a bunch of random tv/award shows, put them all in a cup, then pull two out. You’ll have to sell the pilot to one another. Kind of like a show producer version of Snake Oil.
496 2018-01-30 23:12:33 Avocado oil,  it has been the best cure for my eczema.
497 2018-01-30 23:12:26 De acuerdo, con flotas de rigs a máxima ocupación el Time to Oil se prolonga y esto podría llegar a afectar el precio del crudo. Interesante estudiar el paper!

500 2018-01-30 23:11:51 Trump doesn’t give a rat’s ass if solar panels are made in America.  Sold his soul to the coal & oil guys
501 2018-01-30 23:11:47 At age 69 and living in North Central Wisconsin, currently at 19 degrees. Building a fire in the wood furnace saves heating oil, and I don’t mind doing it either.
502 2018-01-30 23:11:39 Significant backing or buying trophies? A club with 40,000 fans, artificially inflated by their owners, an oil state. So can spend anything it wants. Pep has spent £460 million. If he gets Mahrez, that's over half a BILLION quid. Now that's a joke. It's also not good for the game
503 2018-01-30 23:11:33 This $120 oil change I’m CURRENTLY getting 
504 2018-01-30 23:11:28 Coconut oil will clog tf out of your face pores if they’re not closed or nonexistent. It’s a great body moisturizer and makeup remover though.
505 2018-01-30 23:11:26 Have you been using my immac?! I’ve seen better legs on an oil rig! 
Literally ever line from this show is quotable

508 2018-01-30 23:11:21 @JamzLdnKmt announce beard oil
509 2018-01-30 23:11:10 Yes but then you have to live with the kind of people who think money is the only thing that matters. The kind of people who can only make a living shilling dirty oil. The kind of people who blow all their savings on toys and then cry because they're broke.
510 2018-01-30 23:11:07 Best 'cure' and to keep it at bay - take a combo of Olive Leaf extract as well as Oil of Oregano.  you're welcome soft lad x
511 2018-01-30 23:11:04 Think I can get 20K outta this oil change
512 2018-01-30 23:11:04 Someone should be nice and take my truck to get a tire and an oil change so I can drive it this weekend. 
513 2018-01-30 23:11:01 Yes! I love the MAC lip & eye remover. It takes everything off. Either that or the Neutrogen one (cheaper which is a plus)
As long as you use something with an oil base and let it saturate before rubbing off, you’re golden 
514 2018-01-30 23:10:51 He drizzles extra oil to the others back before massaging it evenly. And carefully.

518 2018-01-30 23:10:12 Pro tip: if the skin around your eyes feels like it was hit by slicing ammo from them being open too long playing MHW all weekend, carefully apply coconut oil (without getting it in your eyes) I used a Q-tip
519 2018-01-30 23:10:10 I use coconut oil for one thang & it ain’t for my damn face ok hunny!
520 2018-01-30 23:10:10 For those that need an oil change (their cars, ha ha) Jiffy Lube on Stirling Road is having specials all week long when you order through Take My Car. #jiffylube #Hollywood #Stirling #takemycar #oil
521 2018-01-30 23:10:02 Yeah yeah....now let’s talk about Russian sanctions approved by both houses that trump refuses to enforce, ruining our beautiful environment by allowing mining and dumping, getting rid of clean air standards, opening our coasts to oil drilling, to name a few.  For the sake of $
522 2018-01-30 23:10:00 BLOOD: stocks down; Treadury bonds down; EM down; corp bonds down: gold down; bitcoin down; oil down....people flying to cash then?
523 2018-01-30 23:09:46 Coconut oil isn’t a scam it works for some people doesn’t for others
524 2018-01-30 23:09:41 Wish he,d get off twitter, and flog his snake oil elsewhere
525 2018-01-30 23:09:40 Should be cannabis oil specially formulated for medical use only...
526 2018-01-30 23:09:35 Coconut oil works fine for some ppl or maybe y’all forgot everybody skin is different
527 2018-01-30 23:09:35 It boggles the mind the support the #Oilers get from fans. 3pm in the middle of the day & thousands of people are lined up for an autograph
528 2018-01-30 23:09:34 Car dealer gave me a free oil change, it’s the little things that make me happy

531 2018-01-30 23:08:49 a diffuser is like,,, kind of like a humidifier but instead of water it just puffs out little mists of essential oil
532 2018-01-30 23:08:43 Like, the Bible literally suggests a facial oil during fasting so that your skin won’t give away the fact that you’re fasting.
533 2018-01-30 23:08:42 Hate how y’all jump on trends ....but I hate even more how fake y’all be when y’all find out new information y’all mfs been using it for years but now all of a sudden it’s “anybody using coconut oil is stupid af” blah blah ..Okay guys
534 2018-01-30 23:08:38 Shilling for coins whenever and however he can.  He must have been a snake oil salesmen or Circus Carney in a former life. Yeah, I'm going with Circus  Carney 
535 2018-01-30 23:08:18 Gonna get this oil change on Friday  either leaving work at 3 or 3:30 haven’t figure it out yet
536 2018-01-30 23:08:12 Giving myself a oil & protein treatment . It’s way past due .
537 2018-01-30 23:08:12 ur welcome for being inspirational
538 2018-01-30 23:08:04 It's crazy how irresponsible and in the past we are living today. Coal, oil, and natural gas are going to destroy our world before we know it. It's time to switch over and start supporting renewal resources.
539 2018-01-30 23:08:02 its time to get back to castor oil
540 2018-01-30 23:08:02 With a little olive oil too 
541 2018-01-30 23:07:59 Secretary Pruitt at WH to praise-bow down-kiss ass & pay tribute to mighty Trump & bring offerings of gold-frankinsence & myrrh from oil-fracking-gas & coal interests owned by Koch Brothers
542 2018-01-30 23:07:43 Also like, clearly Michel Foucault shined his beautiful glossy skull with an oil or cream or something so like,yeah, let's maybe remember that he wrote about panopticon, but he also wrote about sensory pleasure so *shrug emoji* I think millennials are about to kill Foucault again
543 2018-01-30 23:07:42 Exactly what u read
544 2018-01-30 23:07:33 Ugh i hate going to do my car’s oil change
545 2018-01-30 23:07:19 OIL BRENT US$68.6/bbl -1.13%. Oil production across the Permian set to soar as ExxonMobil plans to lift output by more than 400kboepd.
546 2018-01-30 23:07:18 enjoy now, once covered in oil and road grime they lose their classy feel 
547 2018-01-30 23:07:03 @sciencevs Can you please do an episode on coconut oil? There is so much conflicting info! Is it a super food or is it going to give me a heart attack?!

551 2018-01-30 23:06:18 Try charlottes web cbd oil. It’s super helpful w anxiety and gives you all the benefits of weed without the psychoactive part of weed(the high part).
552 2018-01-30 23:06:11 Imagine the uneducated power they have, just because they have oil the can act as executioner. Lol what will saudi do when the petroyuan takes hold, will they demand USA and uk go to war with Russia ?
553 2018-01-30 23:06:11 We don't need more oil and gas we need solar power
554 2018-01-30 23:06:06 I wonder if she will start claiming to be a oil pipeline since the native American isn't working for her anymore.
555 2018-01-30 23:06:04 Pipelines in #parks. Mining in national monuments. Fee increases for families. Oil drilling in our #oceans. This is not #MAGA. This is putting our children, our health, our economy, our wildlife and our planet dead last.  #SOTU

564 2018-01-30 23:04:31 Oil prices are a function of supply and demand, and OPEC in 2016 cut back on production to boost oil prices and thus revenue for themselves
565 2018-01-30 23:04:31 Now rural folk are pariahs for burning wood & smokeless fuels.  Govts have failed to ensure remote areas have fuel choices.  We don’t want to be chained to bottled gas or fuel oil with the volatile market. Only idiots burn wet wood
566 2018-01-30 23:04:28 Coconut oil is not a scam....

571 2018-01-30 23:02:49 You’d expect me to disagree which I do. The idea isnt to predict precisely as much as to parade choices today based on possible future outcomes assuming systems work more or less as they do today. N sea oil got us out of a hole but didn’t mean all 7Os fcasts were irrelevant

574 2018-01-30 23:02:17 Apparently not if you're oil funded
575 2018-01-30 23:02:13 Not sure. But they’ll be sued for billions if they block it. You cannot rightfully interfere with businesses if they meet your requirements. They haven’t done anything wrong. There’s no excuse. It’s a war to control crypto like they want to control oil.
576 2018-01-30 23:02:00 Another win. Exxon Mobil announced on Monday that it plans to invest an additional $35 billion in the U.S. over the next five years . Combined with a recently announced $15 billion investment, the oil giant is going to effectively infuse $50 billion into the American economy.
577 2018-01-30 23:01:59 Suspend? US should BLOCKADE all Venezuela oil exports — if US politicians refuse the more logical and moral move of sending troops onto Venezuelan soil to free the citizenry from their narco commie kidnappers.

583 2018-01-30 23:01:26 Forties enabled control of oil market via ICE BFOE. BP shed pipelines to Ineos once BWAVE ended 1st July 2017. I reckon BP refinancing probably due to settlement of opaque prepaid Forties #OilLoan Short squeeze due to run-off of #DarkInventory would account for Brent/WTI bloat

585 2018-01-30 23:01:22 I agree. I don't think the future is in oil, and I think the Canadian marketplace would be smart to move into renewable fields. That doesn't mean completely crippling the industry in the short term
586 2018-01-30 23:01:16 Iono peanut oil be good wit it though
587 2018-01-30 23:01:08 Just a few drops of the The Exorcist essential oil synergy into the water compartment of an electric vaporizer can make all the difference to someone suffering from a stuffy nose.
588 2018-01-30 23:01:06 Yes... but Texas doesn’t have income taxes, very low other taxes (the benefits of being an oil exporter), you should give it a try, instead of relying on foreigners paying a million dollars for bachelor suite (no seriously... disposal income, give it a try, it’s cool)
589 2018-01-30 23:00:41 i never put coconut oil on my face. i always knew better.
590 2018-01-30 23:00:18 mix it fresh with cottage cheese, salt, pepper and olive oil ) eat with 
591 2018-01-30 23:00:18 The relevance of this for #natgas is....are we close to August 2007 when we still had a good 12 months of bull market ahead of us?or August 2008 when  coal peaked at $145/ton...oil was  around $140/barrel and shorting #natgas became the best play for much of the next decade?
592 2018-01-30 23:00:16 Need a oil embargo. 2 month fuel rations would bankrupt Amazon
593 2018-01-30 23:00:13 Bitches who put coconut oil on their faces out here saying skin care is a scam. I'm SICK
594 2018-01-30 23:00:12 OIL DIFF: 4.38 -> 4.42
595 2018-01-30 23:00:00 who among us wouldn’t want an oil painting of busta rhymes that came to life I mean
596 2018-01-30 22:59:41 Okay one more time for people in the back row..it's all about , oil, , kropomat on Trump, for Trump, and more  for Putin and Trump buddies. We build our military...they build their military, both mean more  for Russian & USA Big Business owners. Read about Russian oil.
597 2018-01-30 22:59:27 You ignore the volumes, types and routes of movement. Some, limited oil-by-rail will still happen but the total volume moved by rail will be minuscule compared to if the pipeline is not twinned.
598 2018-01-30 22:59:20 Tried to make steak and rice. The oil from the pan popped and burned the fuck out of my arm and the bag of rice blew up in the microwave.. eating healthy is going to kill me. Side note, this is the best tasting steak I’ve ever had.
599 2018-01-30 22:59:18 Tell me why Maracuja oil breaks me tf out ?
600 2018-01-30 22:59:17 Sad but true. Expansion of the pipeline is being done with zero consideration to help supply B.C.s drivers with gasoline for their cars. The expanded capacity will used to ship product out of the country. As a result Burnaby's refinery will need to bring in more oil by rail.
601 2018-01-30 22:59:16 If City win the league this year, I'll congratulate them, for their style of play, I'll applaud them. But NEVER ask me to Respect them. Anyone can afford the best house, when they discover an oil well in the back garden.
602 2018-01-30 22:59:08 Because US oil and gas production has already crippled their economy... and because they have a boatload of nukes and kicking them while they're down is not a good idea. But Obama and Clinton both thought it was a great idea to restore diplomatic relations with them. Is that ok?
603 2018-01-30 22:59:03 Ahh man that looks immense (we have no kitchen so I’m itching to cook!) Love the fact there’s cold liver oil tablets too! (Mums always looking after us) x
604 2018-01-30 22:58:59 Pizza is healthy and phytonutrient-rich if you add tomato sauce, olive oil, vegetables and avoid cured, nitrite- containing meats.
605 2018-01-30 22:58:50 1. (Cont.) Think about the maintenance on your car tires, brakes, oil changes and sensors, the Bush years when gas was at $3.79 a barrel...yeah mama is fuckin soldier out here...
606 2018-01-30 22:58:46 I have to admit I was tempted to do something about my bullish oil trade but it's a good idea to at least wait until after SOTU.
607 2018-01-30 22:58:33 And yet people will think that he had. People who support and defend and dare I say follow Schumer @SenSchumer need to merely look at the facts and decide for themselves. And not let MSM con them with snake oil and. Smoke and Mirrors act.
608 2018-01-30 22:58:26 In the economy when a resource runs out, everyone moves on. So of course if oil runs out or the companies involved can not exploit wells anymore, the companies deflate and whatever capital was there flows to new opportunites. That is why they need to be put under UN control.
609 2018-01-30 22:58:17 Finna try this whole “coconut oil on face” thingy 
610 2018-01-30 22:58:13 Random posting of gratitude, thank you kind sir who said the rattling in my engine was a lack of engine oil ..fake blond moment 
611 2018-01-30 22:58:07 Perhaps the oil can from the Tin Man is available!
612 2018-01-30 22:57:49 Lol How’s the Independence movement getting on without the billions in oil revenue that was promised. Seems that that fairy tale came to an abrupt end!
613 2018-01-30 22:57:42 So i took my car in for an oil change amd noe my brake light is out when it wasnt before i cameee in
614 2018-01-30 22:57:36 And I can't wait for my massage oil candle to come in also .
615 2018-01-30 22:57:28 .@TuftsAlumni @TuftsUniversity Just got an email from #Tufts asking me to participate in a webinar about "the perils of oil wealth," but what I'd rather do is get an email announcing that the university finally chose to #divest from fossil fuels...
616 2018-01-30 22:57:23 Two things I would institute if I were rich: 1. Someone to wash and detangle my dry, curly hair 2-3x a week, and 2. Someone to gas up my car, get the oil changed, and get it washed. #authorconfession

619 2018-01-30 22:56:55 The California olive oil in the background is a high quality touch
620 2018-01-30 22:56:55 I have never been to Standing Rock, I'm not Dakota/Lakota, but thank you so much! Of course the media made them out to be all such monsters, but the big oil companies are the true monsters. I mean, it's only logic that something was going to happen.
621 2018-01-30 22:56:44 Nothing says party quite like bby oil and hula hoop!
622 2018-01-30 22:56:44 Yes I'm A DJ & Producer also a Pipeline/Fitter working in the oil field industry 
623 2018-01-30 22:56:39 Angela Basset is made out of glitter,special spices,coconut oil, the purest sugar of all & everything nice. She’s a freaking Gem 
624 2018-01-30 22:56:09 Then you go back to your oil tanker and don't reply
625 2018-01-30 22:55:55 Here I'll repeat because you apparently need repetition. It's all about , oil, , kropomat on Trump, for Trump, and more  for Putin and Trump buddies. We build our military...they build their military, both mean more  for Russian and American Big Business Owners.
626 2018-01-30 22:55:52 I miss my step dad so much y’all. Like I cannot wait to go back to Texas and see him. Especially after that rig explosion in Oklahoma, my oil field dad has been doing this for almost two decades and I still freak out. Don’t know what we would do without him 
627 2018-01-30 22:55:45 I see snake oil salesmen all around selling GRPR compliance audits at thousands of pounds a time.
628 2018-01-30 22:55:41 Are all you walking around tweeting this poor me crap. I guess none ofyou have cars or anything for that matter. Oil is in everything hypocrites
629 2018-01-30 22:55:38 Here's what Drumpf won't talk about in his State of the Union address:

-Profiting off the presidency

-Protecting hedge fund owners

-Rolling back worker safety protections

-Going soft on corporate crime

-Coddling Big Oil and Wall Street
630 2018-01-30 22:55:31 But + not - so = 100% bearish numbers.  
Trying to inform shorts about oil market is trying to inform your grandmother about bitcoin.
631 2018-01-30 22:55:26 And making his Trumptards wealthy in the process. Seems all his cabinet and enablers always find ways to make HUGE profits. For ex. Pipelines, allowing pollution, making solar more expensive, giving his oil buddies unlimited access to profits. DT..
632 2018-01-30 22:55:19 I got my oil changed which took 2 hrs so I walked around Walmart & bought everything! 
633 2018-01-30 22:55:19 Oil is a big part (bigger trade deficit). The other is non-US equity outflows. The last is Treasury outflows due to flatter curve (more expensive to hedge FX as 2Y yields rose) so less demand from the regions with extra low rates.
634 2018-01-30 22:55:18 Tea tree oil!
635 2018-01-30 22:55:00 If you put coconut oil on your face, you’re a stupid bitch and deserve every bump that appears.

644 2018-01-30 22:54:13 Best suggestion would be to go for Indy. Oil looking positive' Scottish Government demonstrating considerable ability in managing NHS compared to UK Government. Even gaining plaudits from the likes of Sanjeev Gupta - in a whole different league. I agree.

646 2018-01-30 22:53:37 Peameal bacon is bacon (not strip) that is coated with cornmeal and cured, then salted (or otherwise naturally preserved) and cooked with oil or on the bbq. Strip is like American bacon but higher quality and less salty and gross. Slice is uncured ham but like peameal
647 2018-01-30 22:53:34 Olive oil?? Sounds foreign
648 2018-01-30 22:53:34 I’m not sure City’s oil money laden coffers count as “self sufficient”
649 2018-01-30 22:53:33 Virgin olive oil comes from???
650 2018-01-30 22:53:30 Yes that’s what I have and they work great :) recently I’ve been loving jojoba oil on my face bc it’s not too oily or too dry, so it’s perfect for the dry parts of my skin and doesn’t make my nose too oily
651 2018-01-30 22:53:25 they arent vegan, they’re fried in the same oil as the meats
652 2018-01-30 22:53:05 I saw this late, but I did put peppermint oil on my temples! Thank you!

678 2018-01-30 22:49:31 Thank you. By then we should have the genetic reports as well. I spoke to her a bit about their process and she said one if their main studies have been CBD oil and so we will be able to try him with it. Just glad to finally be in the right direction!
679 2018-01-30 22:49:15 u can get them wet, just not the first 24 hours. i got them for over 6 months and loved them but they just become kinda annoying. the up keep is too much & u can’t use any oil based products around ur eyes.
680 2018-01-30 22:49:14 Pardon me, I'm coming late to the party. Given that shipments of oil will not cease with the creation of a twinned pipeline, what's your point about "(oil-by-rail) is demonstrably worse from a human health?" It's not like we'll be safer..

683 2018-01-30 22:48:56 coconut oil is a sealant not a moisturizer
684 2018-01-30 22:48:38 Aveda moisturizers are so good i love them but they are expensive  im using clinique moisture surge right now but my skin is super dry and that doesn't give me the moisture I want so I use jojoba oil with it which is non comedogenic.

689 2018-01-30 22:48:02 The goal is to stop importing oil and focus on creating more renewable energy. Keep the oil in the ground.

695 2018-01-30 22:47:24 Drinking my first pint of Neck Oil after @retrovideoclub in Glasgow. @nomadicrevery I get the hype! By keeping it session I’ll surely be sober enough for work tomorrow
696 2018-01-30 22:47:19 Which means more drill sites, oil spills and ruined environment and who makes the $$$$ not the common worker.
697 2018-01-30 22:47:10 Neem or karanja oil is my saving grace!!
698 2018-01-30 22:47:03 Just dug out my bottle of @Aveda Blue Oil. I use it sparingly since its been discontinued. But its such a miracle worker... tempted to drop a ridiculous amount of money on another bottle because I don't want to face a world without it.
699 2018-01-30 22:47:03 esse argumento do entra quem quer é horrível. ainda mais em tempos de neutralidade da net indo pro buraco. o estado que presta deve estimular a livre concorrência e proibir empresas poderosas de se tornarem ainda mais poderosas (p. ex: standard oil)

702 2018-01-30 22:46:47 Maybe they had a marmalade factory and their van broke down?? Erm... Maybe they really like oranges? Maybe they are extracting the oil? They'd need a lot of oranges. I have absolutely no idea to be fair, that's bonkers.
703 2018-01-30 22:46:46 I hope your PROUD of supporting the most unregulated oil producer in the World, Foreign Oil and single handily destroying Canada’s Economy. Where do you think the money comes from for Health Care and other Federal Programs? @OilsandsAction
704 2018-01-30 22:46:43 Little spa music, Warm oil 
705 2018-01-30 22:46:22 Yes... but last time I checked the world still uses a shit ton of oil, and given the choice between Saudi kings and their 4 wives, and putting women to work, paying for health care and schools... id prefer if Canada was the world supplier
706 2018-01-30 22:46:16 We the consumers forced to rely on outdated oil & coal based energy systems backed by the greed of corporations that feed off of our health as well as the health of our planet are to blame for oil spills not President Trump. Clean energy alternatives are available now!...WAKE UP!

713 2018-01-30 22:45:43 I remember one time I listened to the natural hair psychos and used coconut oil on my hair

726 2018-01-30 22:44:27 Went for an oil change. Now I need to sell a kidney for all this other stuff...
727 2018-01-30 22:44:27 Please oh god tell me you see the hypocrisy in that:
Exporting oil from place A = bad for the environment 
Importing oil at place A = good (puts gas in my car)


728 2018-01-30 22:44:26 Analogy on point actually. Permit me to call you a novice in this area. We've agreed money was spent, we've agreed it was Oil Money. What is left is understanding how the money got to City's position seeing as UEFA has a limit on amount owners can pump in. Progress

ALL oil is bad for us. Olive, corn, fish,ect..

Oil cloggs the blood and does not mix with the water. It traps nutriants from reaching the brain too.

STOP EATING OIL !!!

It also cause MOST of our DISEASES !

It traps, oxygen, salt, sugar and toxins.

Medicine is a toxin that only can ease symptoms.

Medicine will not cure us

Oil is not a soluble and makes the blood sluggy

It also causes heart problems

744 2018-01-30 22:43:05 Rachel Notley's gov't was shoe-horned into a one dimensional oil based economy by past gov'ts.  Not one #NDP leader in this country has ever stood up for her. What would they all do if they were in her place? Where are their quick fix ideas for AB?
745 2018-01-30 22:43:01 Alzheimers...How to cure it and prevent it ??

STOP EATING OIL !!!!!

We did not start to eat it until the late 1800's

Olive, Corn, Conola, Fish, Coconut, ect..

ARE ALL BAD FOR YOU !!!

Oil is not a soluble...it does not break down in the blood

It traps oxygen, sugar and salt

747 2018-01-30 22:42:39 Several factors contributed to the demise of the whaling industry, but many historians place the blame squarely on the 1859 discovery of oil in Pennsylvania. 

A decrease in Sperm Whale oil and the Civil War also contributed.

858 2018-01-30 22:30:37 Can this akara oil looking lad stop disturbing my ear with that annoying sound he’s making. Only good with his mouth flute...#BBNaija
859 2018-01-30 22:30:26 And he is a oil painting
860 2018-01-30 22:30:24 Pele, don't let bitterness ruin you. Your Agnelli's weaken rivals by buying top Serie A talents and even buying referees why are you so bothered about oil money.
861 2018-01-30 22:30:19 Coconut oil is a solid in its natural state. Y’all are clogging your pores and stiffening your hair for why?
862 2018-01-30 22:30:09 The House is about to vote on House Bill 1214, which would legalize CBD oil with trace amounts of THC.

865 2018-01-30 22:29:55 Considering the inflows are running choke off, and a lot of that crude is needed for blending, and the over-all stocks are getting lighter and lighter, it matters, but not in the way people are thinking it matters.  Not only is there less oil, it is even less of the oil needed!
866 2018-01-30 22:29:49 Everyday I would religiously put cod liver oil in Sadie's food and still forget to take my capsules 
867 2018-01-30 22:29:49 Any Oil tonight?
868 2018-01-30 22:29:30 Lots of Newf accents on the flight From Edmonton to Toronto today. Great to hear! Hopefully, it’s a sign that it’s picking up in the oil patch.
869 2018-01-30 22:29:30 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
870 2018-01-30 22:29:06 he can bathe in all the oil he wants...there is plenty for all..just tell him to leave the moolah behind when the elephant comes to pick it up:)
871 2018-01-30 22:29:04 A4: Lavender! Only because it's my favorite essential oil that I use for my chronic pain.  #PJChat
872 2018-01-30 22:29:00 hi I'm rich and I like to be your wife if you interested dm me ( i'm Arabic i have oil in my kitchen)
873 2018-01-30 22:29:00 Olbas oil, cold & flu tablets, ear spray - let’s make sure I do not get ill for my birthday then
874 2018-01-30 22:28:58 Let me guess....... you drive a Toyota Prius, have Solar panels all over you house? I’ll take all the oil that can be drilled out of the ground!
875 2018-01-30 22:28:56 If you concede oil companies must address their emissions, you must allow BC to consider consequences of a dilbit spill as legit.
876 2018-01-30 22:28:49 My non-luxury skincare routine and vitamins/pills are one in the same: they're about health, not image. As someone with allergies, eczema and acne, skincare is a crucial part of my Wellness. Because spoiler: Hyaluronic acid works! Tea tree oil works! Snail mucus WORKS
877 2018-01-30 22:28:31 put olive oil all over my hair today
878 2018-01-30 22:28:26 Not sure which educators time is well served attending the show? It does seem curious to suggest it's all snake oil. As with any possible purchase to meet a need it requires an educational/business case which involves establishing the organisation/product can deliver on promise.
879 2018-01-30 22:28:24 Delicious! Seems the time of year for roasted veggies. Been doing sweet potatoes with olive oil and thyme here.

884 2018-01-30 22:28:01 Watermelon with chunks of feta dressed in olive oil!
885 2018-01-30 22:27:54 "He has sent me to... provide for those who grieve in Zion— to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair..." Isaiah 61:3

888 2018-01-30 22:27:27 Letting the coconut oil absorb before I put on clothes...
889 2018-01-30 22:27:11 And no coconut oil in sight 
890 2018-01-30 22:27:05 @TheFive Tell Juan unemployment at 4.1%, stock market up 41%, GEP up 3+ last two quarters, holiday retail sales +4.5%,eliminated must buy of Government health insurance, ISIS routed, Neil Gorsuch, Due to this President the US is the world leader in natural gas, oil and coal.
891 2018-01-30 22:27:03 My best life hack: Use coconut oil to remove your makeup. It’s cheap, lasts forever, and makes your skin so happy.
892 2018-01-30 22:27:03 Does your car insurance cover oil changes? Of course not.  Then why expect your health insurance to cover your physical?  Low-cost catastrophic coverage is all you need!
893 2018-01-30 22:27:02 oh great...more oil in the gulf.  I would like to see America go green as the nations that are first to do so will end up being the richest....and the strongest....and the healthiest....
894 2018-01-30 22:26:57 Scouted Xhaka 40 times and didn't realise he doesn't track runs and moves like a oil tanker.

898 2018-01-30 22:26:37 We'll all need one soon, to burn off all of the shale oil sticking to everything up in here!
899 2018-01-30 22:26:37 If Hillary won with Russian help the GOP would levy sanctions so draconian the Russians would have only their own oil to eat and drink.
900 2018-01-30 22:26:29 I put coconut and rose oil on my face and smell like a straight up SNACK
901 2018-01-30 22:26:21 One lady owner. never abused. oil and air filter always changed on time and thats all i did and ever needed.
902 2018-01-30 22:26:18 Some of us got knowledge, others of us believed for several years that "cantankerous" meant "she could fit in an oil rig."
903 2018-01-30 22:26:13 Definitely going to be a coconut oil hair mask, face mask, do my homework all-night, night.
904 2018-01-30 22:26:11 That’s why we oil and water huh
905 2018-01-30 22:26:07 FUCK wayeseeeee  we were water and oil
906 2018-01-30 22:25:58 Will a Labour gov create underfunding of infrastructure, magically recreate unions and their industries and create a wage price inflation spiral via an opec oil crisis do you think?
907 2018-01-30 22:25:39 Trump and putin are married over oil...follow the money and the pipelines...
908 2018-01-30 22:25:20 I'm into roasted cauliflower this week, choppednup with olive oil and sometimes a bit of spice.
909 2018-01-30 22:25:00 I’ve never had a small dose of oil before work and honestly I don’t feel like I’m high but I feel lighter like my stress is melted. This is a new discovery and one I won’t resort to unless desperate
910 2018-01-30 22:24:55 Only if you count eating coconut oil as exercise
911 2018-01-30 22:24:55 Biiiiiitch I am shook! My oil is gone, my hair smells great, and it left little to no texture yaaaaassss
912 2018-01-30 22:24:51 The economy didn't grow due to some sort of boost because of brexit it was due to the increase in value of oil. Employment was up yes but most people if they did get a pay increase it was below inflation so it was a pay cut in real terms.
913 2018-01-30 22:24:48 Don't you have better things to do, like fighting for #MedicareForAll or fighting against big oil in your locality?
914 2018-01-30 22:24:33 Because we will negotiate hard over matters for the U.K. eg cars, banking, whisk(e)y and let go what doesn’t eg olive oil.
915 2018-01-30 22:24:31 <sarcasm> What? The British Government are interested in our oil and gas? You don't say. </sarcasm>  Of course they are.  The only thing of note here is that you actually think we're thick enough to believe that it's because they care about our economy and interests.
916 2018-01-30 22:24:29 Chicken flavor, with chicken and broccoli  cooked the chicken in soy sauce and sesame chili oil. I didn't fry the noodles too much because I like them chewy.
917 2018-01-30 22:24:27 It’s a sealing oil, not moisturizing. Put it on after you moisturize. 
918 2018-01-30 22:24:20 What could you use to replace the cayenne pepper and rapeseed oil?
919 2018-01-30 22:24:17 The Bush Family Are Hopelessly Devoted To Oil...Petrol Is Their Saviour.

921 2018-01-30 22:23:45 EXXON/MOBIL is pulling Kim Jung Un's strings so we all be too scared to notice when they drill off Waikiki Beach and the Banzai Pipeline surf break get turned into an oil pipeline!
922 2018-01-30 22:23:42 Why wouldn't liberal MA govt, which no doubt join in Russia sanctions call, not care about where their oil at their ports comes from knowing there's a good chance, esp during shortage, that the oil comes frm Russia, knowing Russia funds their shenanigans primarily via oil wealth?
923 2018-01-30 22:23:33 This is the guy who was selling black market oil from Isis and shipping it through his brother’s company, now he slaughters our allies, the Kurds.  The enemy within NATO!
924 2018-01-30 22:23:27 From the picture, I think that's nearly 40% sugar. If you still don't understand the problem... well... sugar=obesity. I'm pretty sure that I'd prefer eat the 20% of palm oil than this sugar.
925 2018-01-30 22:23:20 Oil money is just as good as noodle and tractor money.

929 2018-01-30 22:23:16 Sunflower oil for you then bucko
930 2018-01-30 22:23:11 These are great. But it is important to consider how funds vote proxy statements on shareholder proposals, board elections & even CEO pay (I've seen "reserve replacement" as metric for oil companies. Funds like Calvert do a good job, some of the newer ones figuring it out.
931 2018-01-30 22:23:07 if i wake up tmrw & the coconut oil hasnt washed out my hair...... idk
932 2018-01-30 22:23:05 Disclosure: I think Ezra Levant is batshit insane on most topics.

But the "ethical oil" argument is spot on.

934 2018-01-30 22:22:51 Lmao lotion is a no go in my book, but your absolutely right acne prone skin should avoid coconut oil especially areas w/ more/ larger pores.
935 2018-01-30 22:22:38 I wasn't behind that fraud.  I knew early on that he was a snake oil salesman and an empty suit.  A "man" with no actual accomplishments in his life had no business in the office.
936 2018-01-30 22:22:26 Oil temperature???
937 2018-01-30 22:22:21 Where can i buy almond oil?
938 2018-01-30 22:22:15 HOW TO GET CLEAR SKIN: Drink lots of water, find an oil free foam wash and use twice a day, use an oil free moisturizer. If you have bad acne, just get acne medication from the doc & include into your routine. Thats ALL!!!! I’m speaking from experience.
939 2018-01-30 22:22:12 Tick tock. Tick tock. All the loons who pushed stories about how oil was going to the moon and what not are slowly getting exposed. U.S. oil production is HERE. Your excuses and narratives can't stop it. Demand is mediocre as well. #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent #OPEC #CL_F
940 2018-01-30 22:22:10 Awe try no gasoline, heating oil, cooking oil. Humm..
941 2018-01-30 22:22:05 Got oil on my hand from my dipstick and now I smell like my grandpa and I’m sad 
942 2018-01-30 22:22:02 another hit of Bacta and another hit of Gerin Oil
943 2018-01-30 22:21:57 But aren't the oil prices going up again? Even the Indian Economic Survey released yesterday estimates an increase of ~12% this fiscal. Of course, last years late rally was also about Saudi disruptions, followed by Cushing, Oklahoma reserves being used up a bit too quickly.
944 2018-01-30 22:21:55 Oil takes the piss to come off omd
945 2018-01-30 22:21:43 The worst na angel.... I just feel irritated... forming niger delta trash... why hn no join oil bunkery??? Nonsense
946 2018-01-30 22:21:35 If vegetable oil is made from veggies and corn oil is made from corn....what is baby oil made from??
947 2018-01-30 22:21:31 My question is why did he still have a job?
948 2018-01-30 22:21:30 THE AWESOME JOYRIDE TRANSFORMED INTO A BEAUTIFUL OIL CHANGE
949 2018-01-30 22:21:27 @SlickVic106 @bob_oil The flattening of the 10-2 is misleading. 30 is one to watch. See Ari Wald & Tony Dwyer comments last year. Good stuff
950 2018-01-30 22:21:21 Oil and gas provides half of New Zealand’s energy, powering our homes, businesses and way of life. Turning this supply off overnight is just not realistic - instead we need to have a serious discussion on how to lower our net emissions while meeting a growing demand for energy.

952 2018-01-30 22:21:13 In addition to the environment affects. 

Canadian oil is discounted so much against the WTI because of the lack of accessible trading partners. Getting the oil to the coast is vital for Canadian prosperity
953 2018-01-30 22:21:05 Yes I know. I have friends who grew up in Portland and really miss it. 
All I'm saying is that if people on the west coast aren't willing to help with offshore drilling perhaps they shouldn't complain about it while driving with MY Louisiana offshore oil.
954 2018-01-30 22:20:59 They are, but i hate using them on my lashes. I had to resort to baby oil last night
955 2018-01-30 22:20:55 Oil Leak ?
956 2018-01-30 22:20:52 103(v)…. Well, the answer from the federal government to respond to a guy going around the Oil and Gas Commission service plan $25 4/5

958 2018-01-30 22:20:27 Removing ethane stocks and new line fill (crude oil in pipeline needed for the pipeline to work that cannot be used as inventory but is counted in it) US Crude + Product inventories = Average of 2012 - 2014. And we are building at a slower rate. #OOTT
959 2018-01-30 22:20:09 I have to go to walgreens today for more baby oil gel lol so i'll creep in the shea moisture aisle to see what they talmbout. hhahaha
960 2018-01-30 22:20:07 Almond oil smells divine tho
961 2018-01-30 22:20:06 It honestly reminds me of rosehip oil
962 2018-01-30 22:20:03 olive oil is god tier
963 2018-01-30 22:19:58 My hair likes almond oil but my skin does not. Back to vitamin e oil I go.
964 2018-01-30 22:19:48 @RachelNotley protested against pipelines hired anti oil activists she is against pipelines she is a lying hypocrite
965 2018-01-30 22:19:38 Lavender oil works great!
966 2018-01-30 22:19:25 2018 has been pretty good so far. Y'all finally understand that Latino/Hispanic isn't a race and that coconut oil isn't good for your face 
967 2018-01-30 22:19:20 and there are speakers but its just playing "im oil can harry and im BAAAAD" over and over
968 2018-01-30 22:19:14 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
969 2018-01-30 22:18:59 Acne prone skin just needs to avoid coconut oil. If you have dry skin doing lotion first then sealing with oil is best
970 2018-01-30 22:18:48 I think we need to invest in refining our own oil, instead of shipping it across the ocean and buying it back.  That would keep us west coasters happy and Alta too.

973 2018-01-30 22:18:40 smells like team spirit
974 2018-01-30 22:18:19 Of course it is. Governments can either recover the money from the oil producers or they can get it from the tax payer. It is a no brainer.

978 2018-01-30 22:17:55 Vitamin E oil really is the truth.
979 2018-01-30 22:17:54 Gotta apply the coconut oil & then apply the lotion.
980 2018-01-30 22:17:53 @Electricity4NG Oil is a source of energy while Electricity also is.But one is so important and efficient that we have to purchase one to get the other.Electricity is so important that we have to purchase Oil to get it.Electricity is cheaper and more efficient.

981 2018-01-30 22:17:45 I've got zero time for blatant hypocrisy, and Hudema is the physical embodiment of such.

Yes, we need to progress to more green technology. Yes, climate change is a concern.

We combat these through reduced oil consumption. Not building pipelines doesn't reduce usage of oil.
982 2018-01-30 22:17:43 almond oil is the wave
983 2018-01-30 22:17:31 It makes financial sense to pump it out of the ground as quickly as possible, and certainly quicker than the next guy, before oil has had its day.
984 2018-01-30 22:17:19 @1a Question--if we have such an abundance of oil in fracking, why go to the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to drill???
985 2018-01-30 22:17:18 Hot oil treatment it is 
986 2018-01-30 22:17:16 im not into complex skincare regimes for myself but i just factchecked the part about soap being a new invention and "A formula for soap consisting of water, alkali, and cassia oil was written on a Babylonian clay tablet around 2200 BC" says wiki
987 2018-01-30 22:17:11 You fellows are a beacon of hope in the darkened, nefarious, and contaminated leadership of the baby oil propelled, inorred Zupta regime.#NoRegret#NothingButTheTruth
988 2018-01-30 22:17:05 Funny thing, there already is a pipeline, been there for 50 years, actually supplies 40%+ of all your fuel, ? Then there are the tankers that go right past Vic. and Van. to Bellingham and Anacortes...yet it’s only Canadian oil you have issues with? Funny
989 2018-01-30 22:17:00 Coconut oil don’t work for me period :(
990 2018-01-30 22:16:59 Franklin Graham defends 45 as not having done the nasty in office. Graham rated Putin’s “moral leadership”>Obama in 2014 along w Ron Paul, Giuliani, Buchanan, Peters. 45 in 2015 after 30yrs of RU biz. (2014 oil price) *2016 collusion connection is coincidence*
991 2018-01-30 22:16:58 BC is already a transporter of oil, pipeline & rail car. If you think there are a lot of rail cars now, this time next year there will be 100 times more rail cars and a hundred more chances of a major spill. You are not going to win.
992 2018-01-30 22:16:42 took me a second but i thought you made the olive oil yourself and was very impressed
993 2018-01-30 22:16:40 "I almost bought chevron oil at 29" well nigga you didn't, when did we start praising niggas for "almost" doing shit?
994 2018-01-30 22:16:32 Gas prices sky rocketing across America.....those tax breaks are going into oil companies pockets...Thanks peewee
995 2018-01-30 22:16:29 How to kill time on day off: hour-long tea tree oil conditioning treatment for my hair bc why not :P time to pack the pipe and spark up while I wait (:
996 2018-01-30 22:16:27 This is the same snake oil that Trump sold to coal miners. It's disgusting when politicians do this. People in bad situations make bad decisions based on false hopes, perpetuating a cycle of poverty
997 2018-01-30 22:16:23 He was found using CBD oil without a prescription, and we know how terrible that stuff is
998 2018-01-30 22:16:12 Is oil at $150 DAB yet hun?
Like you said it was ...
999 2018-01-30 22:16:10 Coconut oil?
1000 2018-01-30 22:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or a terrorism crisis.
1001 2018-01-30 22:15:44 ladies dont moisturize your face with just oils. just like u dont put oil on your hair when its dry. not only will that break your hair but it will break your skin to. Love ya self sis
1002 2018-01-30 22:15:42 And cease the sale of diesel and gasoline via Transmountain.  Let BC buy oil products from America.
1003 2018-01-30 22:15:39 Of course.  Higher oil prices supports Putin’s primary GDP
1004 2018-01-30 22:15:15 $70 oil changes should come with a car wash or something at least, shit.
1005 2018-01-30 22:15:07 Maybe you should worry about diversifying your economy instead of playing your own political games.  There is no future for oil and gas. The sooner you realize this, the better
1006 2018-01-30 22:15:06 Air wick oil scents were honestly one of my best purchases ever, my rooms always be smelling soooooo good 
1007 2018-01-30 22:15:02 Now that LNG is gone, BC is 100% reliant on AB pipelines to get its oil & gas to its only market. Tit for tat could be expensive.
1008 2018-01-30 22:14:54 forreal! the walgreen by my house (& my dads house) is all wiped out!!! i need that oil! lol

1010 2018-01-30 22:14:43 The oil I use on my bike chain has a colour not far from that of olive oil. When it goes on the chain, the chain is a silver colour with a slight sheen. Today, when I took the old chain off it was black. I thought I'd degrease it to get it clean Aoi can make things from it.
1011 2018-01-30 22:13:43 as for the rest of my body, I soak in dead sea salt, an assorted oils, use this coal tar based stuff, and again, coconut oil. Also I tan certain parts (I did light therapy last year & I am going to the spas in Budapest in a couple of months)
1012 2018-01-30 22:13:43 So now everyone is slandering coconut oil lol. If it works for you, use that shit. No, it’s not the only oil...yes, there are other oils that have better benefits. Personally Vitamin E, Olive and Jojoba are my faves...but if it works for you, use that shit lol
1013 2018-01-30 22:13:36 castor oil + coconut oil have been doing wonders for my hair, highly recommend!!
1014 2018-01-30 22:13:29 But we need their oil and slave labor
1015 2018-01-30 22:13:28 Hope he's OK!! Carter is just getting over his cold :( Snuffle Babe run is great  Also some Baby Olbas Oil in an oil burner did the trick for us! Xx

1019 2018-01-30 22:13:01 Oh boy... it is so individual. Coconut oil helps. As does lanolin (in the winter) I do a serum, a facial oil, and a moisturizer with spf. It keeps some things under control along w/some prescription stuff.
1020 2018-01-30 22:13:01 Hood up cap off oil change bay 1!
1021 2018-01-30 22:13:01 I'm not sure what you are trying to say. Any oil spill is a tragedy but the point is that bitumen does not represent an existential threat. The research indicates that a bitumen spill is about as bad as a heavy oil spill.

1028 2018-01-30 22:12:22 You are dreaming. That is like the nature conservation done by the oil companies.
1029 2018-01-30 22:12:13 i literally CANNOT use coconut oil on my face, it’s terrible.
1030 2018-01-30 22:12:11 This is not redistribution of oil wealth, but rather printing money
1031 2018-01-30 22:11:58 Kocks are big oil promoters.  That is all they care about and have promoted lies for some time.  They aren't any better than Trump/Mercers.
1032 2018-01-30 22:11:56 Putting it lightly, governments are very stupid. The oil is going to be produced and sold no mater what rules are in place. They can install the pipeline, or fight it and loose $20 billion per year. That lost money has to be made up by the tax payer.

1051 2018-01-30 22:08:18 We really do. But it looks as if they're going to try and hide this with this oil transport ban strategy. I hope people don't get lulled by this.
1052 2018-01-30 22:08:14 It's your boy,   Four centuries of oil
1053 2018-01-30 22:08:12 They saw what Quebec and Montreal specifically were able to do with the Energy East Pipeline and are following the playbook. Land locking Alberta oil goes against national interests.

1066 2018-01-30 22:06:48 Of course. Big oil owns Congress and now the executive branch. They will be able to pollute the earth and make billions in low taxed profits. Why not come to the US!

1076 2018-01-30 22:05:49 I know, lol. BUT (and I really hope it doesn't happen), if it tests 66 again, oil forms a bullish pattern and we probably see 70+. With the amount of super bearish data we're going to get, that's unlikely.

1155 2018-01-30 21:58:31 do not shave/touch a blade for 4 weeks. at least depending on your growth... then get a trim to even out the beard....beard oil helps...

1161 2018-01-30 21:57:14 co Founder Earth First UK..(with Ecologist founder money).. loads of big oil protests.. also protest against oil companies whilst he was at Rising Tide.. I have a quote somewhere Greenpeace were nervous about working with Marshall because of his direct actions!
1162 2018-01-30 21:57:09 I want to do an oil painting of this. But I will only do it if @RiotRogers promises to hang it above a fireplace in a massive gold frame.
1163 2018-01-30 21:56:41 They have it all. Got their mole in the Supreme Court. Got judges. Rolled back epa. Oil is king. Climate is bs. America has walked away as a leader. Has insulted everyone but Russia. White Russia that now is our bff. Religion is king.
1164 2018-01-30 21:56:40 That doesn’t change the fact that #climatechange means we have to stop burning fossil fuels soon, and that means exploration for new oil is the wrong thing to do.
1165 2018-01-30 21:56:36 Still eating it though. Such a shame of perfectly good pasta. But omg it takes awful with that olive oil coming through the cheese and eggs. #pity #shame #ieatitcositspasta #questionofprinciples #pastadimamma #gotfuckedup

1167 2018-01-30 21:56:22 You must never give up the fight- the law must be changed and rights of nature must be incorporated and take precedence over the toxic oil industry.
1168 2018-01-30 21:56:22 rose water, witch hazel, aloe Vera or Apple cider vinegar... stay away from coconut oil it clogs pores like crazy
1169 2018-01-30 21:56:19 Guy iwobi needs to go loan to find himself.  Xhaka is a waste. That xhaka Ramsey partnership is just as good as water and oil mixing. Cech has found a retirement home. Lacazette looked like a lost child waiting for his daddy. Mr Wenger wengered the game.
1170 2018-01-30 21:56:10 I did it I ordered an oil diffuser  My coworkers one in the office smells SO good & calming I just NEEDED that in my bedroom

1174 2018-01-30 21:55:24 Came to get my oil changed, expecting it to be like $30 but nope it's $65 bc I have an oil leak 
1175 2018-01-30 21:55:18 My roommate really took my pan, used it, scratched it, and left hella oil in it without even asking or washing it  she really wants these hands
1176 2018-01-30 21:55:10 Can someone please explain to BC that they are part of a greater country. And they DO NOT own the coast. What if AB said “this is OUR oil, the transfer payments stop NOW!”
Trudeau and the rest of Canada would lose their minds.

1179 2018-01-30 21:54:56 scots get 8% of the UK’s far  greater none oil revenues though so it balances out
1180 2018-01-30 21:54:47 And what it proves is that the oil is extremely dangerous as it will cover our beaches and float on our waters, destroying our tourism industry our wildlife, our fisheries and more.
1181 2018-01-30 21:54:44 Nah bitch
1182 2018-01-30 21:54:30 I’m thinking Canyon. Wallrides + Oil Rig + Cacti is a tough combo to beat.

1193 2018-01-30 21:53:59 I think countries like Saudi Arabia are trying to diversify but have a lack of skills and oil wealth has created an entitlement culture. Not helped of course by not allowing 50% of the population to fulfil their potential.
1194 2018-01-30 21:53:38 Use witch hazel to tone your whole face after you wash it and you can use benzoyl peroxide to put it on individual pimples which will clear them up faster. Just make sure you moisturize or your face will get too dry and that will cause it to produce more oil
1195 2018-01-30 21:53:23 Wow. No wonder oil sector is a boommin. And if big ol XOM with its bureaucracy can get costs that low, then a whole lot of independents should be doing great.

1197 2018-01-30 21:53:18  I feel you I have really dry hair and it’s low porosity so coconut oil is a big help at helping product absorb and sealing it in for me!
1198 2018-01-30 21:53:14 LOOL pretty sure it's a grocery store, right? Totally sounds like it could be a hardware, but the first time I heard about it someone was talking about coconut oil so I guessed

1201 2018-01-30 21:52:58 There is no 'Upside' for BC to be used as a transport corridor for Alberta's oil. Alberta has a poor record of handling spills in their own back yard. Why should BC accept the risk and responsibility of cleaning up the inevitable spills that will occur. #oilsands

1215 2018-01-30 21:52:04 I think the depiction of white people in that movie in relation to indigenous exploitation was total naivete in the case of the do-gooders like the FBI lady (her unpreparedness reflected a systematic ignorance of exploitation) and pure evil in the case of the oil folks.
1216 2018-01-30 21:51:53 The South East can keep what it has, we’ll keep Scotland, our resources and our oil!

1218 2018-01-30 21:51:36 Giving the 'Russia Hacked the Election' and 'Trump's Returns' more air time than our healthcare crisis is unacceptable. 

Has she spoken about Flint not having any fresh water? Or what about the Oil industry being the #1 cause for the damage Hurricane Harvey was able to cause?
1219 2018-01-30 21:51:29 Heather it is us though, we are the ones creating the demand for the palm oil because we are the ones consuming it. We've got to learn how to avoid and we've got to support all campaigns to change things xx

1226 2018-01-30 21:50:27 So Fulani herdsmen are now attacking NNPC workers on pipeline work. 

Mr. President, take action; cattle cannot replace crude oil as our main revenue source.
1227 2018-01-30 21:50:18 The Texas economy is driven largely by mining, oil, and natural resource extraction. California is driven by innovation. We create value out of ideas. Texas just pulls value out of the ground.

1229 2018-01-30 21:50:05 Some guy refused to talk to me, asked if there was a guy he could talk to instead. Then he asked my male associate about an oil filter. I can’t type in the year make and model of your Toyota Prius because I have a vagina? Men will always baffle me.

1238 2018-01-30 21:48:49 truth is we can't amount to much with Wenger as coach, the man has got nothing of football in him anymore, he has given it all, his brain is at a resting point right now

1240 2018-01-30 21:48:32 2 vehicles synthetic oil and filter change cost $150. For $143 you can buy ramps, 10 quarts of top of the line synthetic oil, and 2 new filters. Do it yourself and save money.

1288 2018-01-30 21:42:46 Shea butter, coconut oil, lavender oil, Black castor oil, bentonite clay masks, a cocoa butter sheet mask, grape seed and jojoba oil. Everything

1290 2018-01-30 21:42:20 Super bummer. The gas & oil drilling, & development where we live in Colorado is messing up the amount of riding space there. Even had explosions. Feels stupid to trailer horses & take them somewhere else to have room to ride.

1292 2018-01-30 21:41:56 Public lands are a national treasure for us to enjoy and leave to our children--not another asset for Republican pillaging!  Increase jobs by supporting solar, wind, and other non-polluting energies, not dirty, earthquake causing fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas.
1293 2018-01-30 21:41:46 Perhaps, has the vet cleaned its teeth recently?  One remedy for reducing bacteria and toxins is virgin coconut oil.  I know its a hassle but rub coconut oil on kitties gum line daily.

1427 2018-01-30 21:29:12 This does not stop the oil trains. They will continue to our oil refineries and to other states like California.

1429 2018-01-30 21:29:07 Having a boyfriend that knows how to change oil is such a blessing

Folks, gotta gear up for 2018. Be ready, Bastards fight dirty.
1431 2018-01-30 21:28:57 things that y’all drag that I don’t understand:
1. Coconut oil
2. St. Ives
1432 2018-01-30 21:28:49 If they didn’t want ‘em yesterday, they hated ‘em today. Down 400 intra day, the S&P 31, the Nasdaq 62. The 10 yr closed at 2.72 and was deemed a culprit. Oil stocks and health care also took it on the chin.
1433 2018-01-30 21:28:44 Wait... 

"In any manner" 

Hmmmmmm

Are you Sure?

1437 2018-01-30 21:28:08 Can you see my Oli?  Wenger needs to get he and Laca/Auba running like a well oil 2-striker machine.
1438 2018-01-30 21:28:07 My question is where USA is heading when they want all, the oil, the medicine,  the food, the currency, the military superiority and air?
1439 2018-01-30 21:28:05 Like sister sledge sang “we have oil money ”
1440 2018-01-30 21:27:51 it must be nice dabbin on a chizzled nail and a oil clogged rig, i’m jealous
1441 2018-01-30 21:27:50 can someone rub argan oil into dean’s eyebrows so they’ll grow back
1442 2018-01-30 21:27:47 I will always think of Noxema and Dr. Bronner's as the very definition of clean, and Oil of Olay as a precious splurge.
1443 2018-01-30 21:27:46 You know it's cold when the coconut oil is hard for the first time this month.
1444 2018-01-30 21:27:42 Liquin is probably one of my favorite scents. Perfect medium for oil paints. 10/10 would recommend
1445 2018-01-30 21:27:12 When I am looking at a recipe that requires melting butter with olive oil.

1447 2018-01-30 21:27:06 With all due respect, NAFTA gave the U.S. "equal access" to our oil as though it was one of our own provinces. Great deal for  - I'm trying to remember which Prime Minister signed that deal - oh, it was Mr. Mulroney    #

1449 2018-01-30 21:26:48 Once in a generation, another oil boom, everyone £500 better off, yes we'll get straight into the EU, guff like that?
1450 2018-01-30 21:26:32 Putin plundered a very rich region Donbas to pay for his war there.
Asad pays for Putin's help in Syria. 
Russia's economy is build on two things: selling oil and selling weapons. So he benefits from conflicts by selling weapons to his partners.

1453 2018-01-30 21:26:03 America needs to ramp up on Nuclear energy so we can brake free of oil producing countries and to charge up all those electric Cars.

Solar and Wind power wont suffice.

1462 2018-01-30 21:24:38 so I would quite happily place my head in a vat of hot oil right now
1463 2018-01-30 21:24:36 I used tea tree oil a few times for those bumps if u got a bump and other than that i would dissolve some sea salt in some warm water and like... Hold my head in a shallow container full of it to tryand clean it if you havent tried that before?
1464 2018-01-30 21:24:36 Climate change proved false?
Do you get your scientific info from Fox Entertainement TV?
Are you familiar with ocean acidification?
Do think 4 years of record high temps in a row is normal?
Isn’t climate change denial more profitable for oil companies?
1465 2018-01-30 21:24:35 RazoRock XXX beardgoatee oil is the first of this type of product that I've used, I must say I am very sold on using a such a product. I've noticed that not only does it keep hairs in line, it also keeps them soft. Great scent, great price.
1466 2018-01-30 21:24:32 No problem lol. I'll give the vitamin E oil a try

Call it piss or poison, same difference.... 
1474 2018-01-30 21:23:26 idk why people are so against coco oil on the face. just don’t leave it on there, rinse. it only makes some people acne worse not everyone’s, stop dissin my baby 
1475 2018-01-30 21:23:25 Organic cold-pressed jojoba oil (it's like six bucks at any neighborhood beauty store and turns your skin to velvet) and African black soap (essential cleanser/sometimes shampoo)
1476 2018-01-30 21:23:13 So in summery I found Mania my biggest disappointment because
- a good chunk of its levels were literal copy pastes from past Sonic games
- The end levels dragged on
- It had Oil ocean
- It had Sonic CD stuff (Sonic CD is my least favorite Sonic game)
1477 2018-01-30 21:23:13 Next Tuesday !!! Nah but how is huda @going in to Holland and Barrett’s and telling this dude hemp oil is marijuana  and the other thing I have to tell you in person before I’m banned off twitter cause of @jamahuda_
1478 2018-01-30 21:23:05 Yeah, but not just vitamin e oil by itself. It’s mixed w one of my other oils lol. It’s for brightening, I’m pretty sure
1479 2018-01-30 21:23:04 I think coconut oil on skin is one of those things where it’s bad generally speaking and I think science agrees? There’s exceptions to everything obvs and half the ppl who claim it works for them just have naturally great skin and skin advice from them is a bit of a scam itself

Oil prices go down when there is oversupply. 
The BC refineries in Vancouver area all shut down, except one, which lacks supply. TM bitumen is sent to the US

1486 2018-01-30 21:21:52 Hi Mitesh,
Crude oil prices in international marker is around $70/ bbl. Also $ rate is reduced to 63 but modi not ready to reduce excise duty which they had increased insteady they are increasing petrol prices on daily basis. They are looting people and making people fool.

1488 2018-01-30 21:21:37 Have you tried vitamin e oil?
1489 2018-01-30 21:21:30 depends on who's wearing it imo. but most of the time it does just look like people need to invest in oil blotting papers lol
1490 2018-01-30 21:21:29 im getting my oil changed and the guy comes in and he’s like “you like mozart?” and i just say “uh yeah haha” like that’s weird then i remember the only radio station i listen to is kbaq
1491 2018-01-30 21:21:29 And it’s UK Government’s who treat our troops like canon fodder. They send them to oil rich countries to put their lives on the line so their political masters can steal oil and make themselves rich. Can’t remember the SNP doing that. #ghoulbritannia 
1492 2018-01-30 21:21:14 Different type of Cunts, there not oil cunts 
1493 2018-01-30 21:21:07 My guess is increased GDP = more taxes, oil grid leases, taxing new employees with over 2 million jobs created & pay raises.  Or just maybe Mexico will be paying for it too.  Lol
1494 2018-01-30 21:21:05 I’m in the Kia customer lounge while they change my oil and I think I just met my bestfriends.. Debra and Ron you guys rock!!
1495 2018-01-30 21:21:03 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with #gynecomastia.

1500 2018-01-30 21:20:39 Then it just seems like needless pandering, ESPECIALLY when the levels made specifically for the game itself (Chemical plant Act 2, Studiopolis etc) were really REALLY good 

Also it had Oil ocean, my personal least favorite 2D sonic level (2/3)
1501 2018-01-30 21:20:18 Me too. I don't like showers, they're too ... noisy. End of day bath, and I use my cheap shampoo for bubbles. (And since skin-care twitter is a thing today, calendula infused olive oil for my skin).

You will be changing oil
1504 2018-01-30 21:20:04 Just make sure you're using a cleanser that removes make up first (a balm is usually best), then a soothing/cream/oil cleanser second. FWIW, I love Trader Joe's oil cleanser, everyone likes Boscia's cleansers, and Belif has a great cleansing stick that makes it easy.
1505 2018-01-30 21:19:48 The conservatives did that themselves 40 yrs of the same thing doesn’t ever lead to a different outcome the consvtves managed tonflitter away all the oil royalties for themselves and cronies cant blame new govt for that
1506 2018-01-30 21:19:40 Oilers need to improve their overall speed. Patch could be alright but I'd want to see Looch going the other way. Not sure why we don't push for it a bit harder but Debrincat would be a great fit in Oil Country...not sure what it would take to pry him away from the Hawks though
1507 2018-01-30 21:19:16 This dry ass, windy weather makes me want nothing more than to lay in a bath of shea butter and coconut oil.  Ugh.
1508 2018-01-30 21:19:16 引火したら、もう手遅れさ…
1509 2018-01-30 21:19:11 Forgive my skepticism, but the oil patch is still hurting. We have not recovered. I’m roughnecking for $25.70/hr when I used to make $32. No retention bonus, no gear subsidy, decreased travel time. Higher taxes, higher cost of living. Words don’t put food in people’s cupboards.
1510 2018-01-30 21:19:10 It also will take multiple rounds of full head foils to lighten so it doesn't kill your hair. At least that is what most professionals use. You also will want to use coconut oil on your hair to help repair the damage

1515 2018-01-30 21:18:49 More oil, cheaper gasoline, macroeconomics says lower prices...
1516 2018-01-30 21:18:24 2 possibilities
the first is, he has no example.
the second is, he has examples, but naming those would have just add even more oil to the fire.
1517 2018-01-30 21:18:18 I wish! Just getting the oil changed.
1518 2018-01-30 21:18:17 Fresh and warm bread..olive oil..just a a little salt and oregano ...snack of greek tobacco farmes in greece 30 years ago..and still my favorite

1527 2018-01-30 21:17:34 No I don’t. I just showered and put coconut oil on
1528 2018-01-30 21:17:31 Tja, det beror ju på hur dyrt det fossila bränslet blir. Alltså inte på grund av skatter (det också om politiska beslut tas), utan på grund av "peak oil", att de fossila bränslena blir dyrare när utbudet minskar medan efterfrågan fortsätter öka.
1529 2018-01-30 21:17:23 This is problematic, perhaps because the Gulf had much lesser connection with western cosmopolitanism than Baghdad, Beirut, Cairo, Casablanca etc so it was forgotten until Oil. (our cosmopolitanism was rather persian/afro/indian-connected); but we still had Khaliji Jews.

1542 2018-01-30 21:15:54 USA: the share of natural gas in fossil fuel production was 41% in 2017. Coal was the leading fossil energy until 2010. Oil is now number 2 (source: US Energy Information Administration)
1543 2018-01-30 21:15:22 Bitcoin is similar to oil..... “It’s gone up too far, too fast and was due for a correction,” says Michael Hiley, head of over-the-counter energy trading at LPS Futures LLC. “It’s a similar feeling to the stock market - both are running hard and both... are correcting.”

1548 2018-01-30 21:14:54 Oh, thank you so much! Miriam made me put coconut oil on it, and it didn't help at all. And I woke up and found a whole family of mice chewing on it.

1556 2018-01-30 21:13:34 It’s not about what she’s said. It’s about what she’s done. If she removed the carbon tax, removed caps on oil sands emissions, lowered taxes to pre-NDP levels, and committed not to bringing anti-oil zealots onto her staff, then that would be enough for me.

Wired: hot oil to defend siege against your position
1558 2018-01-30 21:13:30 It's a healthy way to cook it since you don't need to add butter or cooking oil. Plus, it locks in the moisture and the flavors of any herbs/sauces you've added to the fish :)

1564 2018-01-30 21:12:58 Same... alternative medicines are real... nature has always given us everything we have needed... but I know a snake oil salesman when I see one... u cured cancer and hiv with natural methods... cool... can I see them? What exactly did u do?

1566 2018-01-30 21:12:25 It’s so crazy different the experience with coconut oil is for everybody. 
Coconut oil is so great at taking my mascara off at the end of the day!

1568 2018-01-30 21:12:13 I came in this mf for a oil change , an ended up spending 300 dollars 
1569 2018-01-30 21:12:11 That’s a coconut oil jar, pardon me.

1571 2018-01-30 21:12:03 Coconut oil works for my skin
1572 2018-01-30 21:11:35 Translation: "I don't like that the BC govt has the right to evaluate for itself whether or not bitumen can be cleaned up in water. It should trust the word of oil companies who are, at their core, altruistic entities who only want the best for people."
1573 2018-01-30 21:11:30 What's going on with that hair. Like a Vileda dipped in engine oil.
1574 2018-01-30 21:11:24 Oil - heads up for the inventory data due around the bottom of the hour Official data is Wednesday morning US time - ahead of that is the private data - this comes out to subscribers to their service at 4.30pm NY time and hits media in the minutes following
1575 2018-01-30 21:11:24 Another knee-jerk response from most coin owners. This is turning into stocks. Oil price up=stock down. Oil price down=stocks down, war going somewhere=stocks down, someone farts=stocks down

1590 2018-01-30 21:09:12 Bitcoin is similar to oil... “It’s gone up too far, too fast and was due for a correction,” says Michael Hiley, head of over-the-counter energy trading at LPS Futures LLC. “It’s a similar feeling to the stock market - both are running hard and both... are correcting.”
1591 2018-01-30 21:09:09 I never realized how high maintenance my dog was until I was sitting on the floor applying a warm rag to Blue’s nose before I had to apply his daily coconut oil on the dry spots on his nose

1598 2018-01-30 21:08:40 Yes indeed nothing like a smooth talking snake oil salesman! He was as phony and dishonest as a three dollar bill!
1599 2018-01-30 21:08:29 America voted in Putins crony. Dictatorship is now the new America. Pollution, big oil & criminals are in charge. The lands are being taken, streams polluted & the poor starved. Why would anyone in their right mind want anything to do with it? It was ONCE the place to live.
1600 2018-01-30 21:08:29 I'm fine with that as long as they can sort out legitimate media from propaganda outfits funded by oil that spread hate speech operate for profit by chasing every low charlatan peddling anti social or corporate biased matter.
1601 2018-01-30 21:08:28 Reserves is oil that can be produced. "Leaving some oil" implies not recovering a portion of 3P technical resources (not same issue) @kmac

1610 2018-01-30 21:07:18 Glad you could attend. Gosh, kind of thought Innovation was a priority of all parties in #ableg given the need to rely less heavily of oil and gas revenues in the future.
1611 2018-01-30 21:07:04 That’s oil it can be Dan. They’ve given up worrying about where the Russian mafia made his money from lol. Funny they didn’t like thaksin tho. There’s a likeness here me think lol.

Me: “awesome.”
1623 2018-01-30 21:05:39 Coconut oil works really well & rosewater to cleanse the face.

This helps! 
1627 2018-01-30 21:05:28 Being an adult is spending your birthday money on a oil change 
1628 2018-01-30 21:05:17 No. He's Putin's Bestie bcs 45 fails to implement 517-5 sanctions legislation, sent Jared to create secret comms channel at RUembassy, revealed intel to RUAmb for fun, covets off-limits Exxon/RU oil acreage, attacks Am citizens while praising MurderousDictator as brilliant etcetc
1629 2018-01-30 21:05:12 Brought my car, Veronica, to the shop to get an oil change and inspection and they said SHE’S PERFECT. AND I FILED MY MF TAXES AND GOT $1000 SO YEAH IM PRETTY FUCKING PUMPED TODAY.
1630 2018-01-30 21:05:12 Meanwhile, client receives 10-12 solicitations for "rank in 5 days" snake oil and legit SEOs spend 25% of their energy defending the slog.
1631 2018-01-30 21:05:05 i started using witch hazel and vitamin e oil on my skin. i'll come back to this tweet with updates
1632 2018-01-30 21:05:05 Haha, no thanks! No gym and no calorie counting for me. Low carb, high quality fats and proteins instead, it’s much easier. And whisky has no carbs 
1633 2018-01-30 21:04:43 You know what’s weird? Every single time I take my car in for an oil change, they always seem to find something else wrong. Like...I’m sorry, did I ask you to check my brakes? No, I asked you to change my oil and fix my headlight.
1634 2018-01-30 21:04:35 I stopped believing when I realized the holy water was extra virgin olive oil. Pastor put that shit on my face like no nigga I’m not a burger I’m about to get pimples cuz you fuckin around my nigga

1639 2018-01-30 21:03:41 Unfortunately our Ab government doesn't have a lot if credibility. Most of them actively campaigned against the oil and gas industry until they ended up in govt and figured out how the bills were being paid. Now backtracking? Tzeporah Berman advising?  Good luck!
1640 2018-01-30 21:03:36 RT RusselNorman: We can't burn existing fossil fuel reserves if we are to avoid climate catastrophe. That's why Greenpeace activists have occupied this vessel in New Plymouth, which is supporting the Amazon Warrior seismic blasting the NZ ocean searching for new oil …

1656 2018-01-30 21:01:56 Holy crap. I went to get oil change before I took my car to a mechanic (car is having major acceleration/idle issues) and the freaking @jiffylube guy said “I think I know what’s wrong with your car” and FIXED IT and didn’t charge me. Faith in humanity: RESTORED
1657 2018-01-30 21:01:44 I look forward to Scotland having control of renewable energy and leaving oil in the ground
1658 2018-01-30 21:01:22 i said this on someone else's thread but my skin has never been clearer than when i just started removing makeup with witch hazel and then moisturizing with coconut oil. expensive skincare routines are silly IMO.
1659 2018-01-30 21:01:13 I have eczema so coconut oil isn’t the best moisturizer for me but it also hasn’t created any break outs & my skin gets affected easily
1660 2018-01-30 21:01:06 Oh yeah! Fish oil fo sho.
1661 2018-01-30 21:01:05 Yo I got some rosehip oil for my face and my skin is so happy

1694 2018-01-30 20:57:22 I actually cook meats with butter instead of oil and the food tastes so much better.  Probably why i'm so soft. xP
1695 2018-01-30 20:57:14 Read about the opportunities in the 1445km 24 inch East African Crude Oil Pipeline project that will run from Kabaale, Hoima in Uganda to Tanga in Tanzania in this weeks oil and gas journal in the @newvisionwire
1696 2018-01-30 20:57:12 and, we're back to the erosion of the news/info space. that and tax avoidance are critical issues of the day (and the oil & gas backlash). but, without a meta-narrative about democracy, people are slipping and sliding incoherently trying to use old ideologies as a lens...
1697 2018-01-30 20:57:09 I would go wall panel. Oil heaters eat electricity for breakfast.  Mxx
1698 2018-01-30 20:57:07 i need food , to pay bills , and an oil heater for my room but i can only choose one so i guess its billss

1701 2018-01-30 20:56:56 Hang in there. I will be praying you and the baby will come out with no complications. I have had dozens of surgeries. the thing to remember is not to take fish oil or blood thinners 2 weeks ahead of procedure and take B vitamins, which I am sure you're on.  B's help clotting.
1702 2018-01-30 20:56:54 And how much of that "investment" will line your and the GOP's pocket to protect the oil/gas industry?
1703 2018-01-30 20:56:50 Late last week. Posted about Holmes Rd. Off of Hwy 90a and Main Area. District K. About road conditions and Oil spill into drainage. Two 55 drums. Okay next day. Band aid on road for pot holes. Monitor above ground on oil. All of oil Drain d through system.
1704 2018-01-30 20:56:46 As a conservative you have to adore big tobacco, big oil, and keeping poor people poor. Those are the rules!
1705 2018-01-30 20:56:41 Ain’t that the kick in the head; but in this case, it’s oil lmao
1706 2018-01-30 20:56:39 so y’all was really out here putting coconut oil on……YOUR FACE?!?
1707 2018-01-30 20:56:36 God I hate getting my oil changed, there's way too many people talking loud af on their phone in a tiny ass room 
1708 2018-01-30 20:56:03 3/4 times w a face wash or just water??? also do u still use teatree oil
1709 2018-01-30 20:56:01 My idea is this. I Live in the region. Usa wants to carry the raqqa oil  via Afrin to east mediterranean  sea for the world markets. thats why they tell all this b. Shit about Afrin Terrorists that the are victimazed etc.
1710 2018-01-30 20:55:58 All my tweets, except for one where I got sloppy with a pronoun, were referring to liberal govt officials allowing/controlling/regulating oil imports.  I never meant "buying", even though I did screw up that communication in one tweet in this string.
1711 2018-01-30 20:55:49 Chocolate companies can you please take palm oil/fat out of your chocolate!?! So many have it in there now & it's rotten for the body and the environment!! Her, irritates me!!! #nopalmoil #chocolate
1712 2018-01-30 20:55:45 i’m making red velvet cupcakes and so much shit happened.

1714 2018-01-30 20:55:29 Strictly speaking the $ is worthless since it is backed by a printing press only. It kept its illogical value because oil was traded in $. Things are changing with adverse effect on the $!
1715 2018-01-30 20:55:29 Someone tweeted that it made them break out now all of a sudden everyone’s like “me too!” When everyone was just coconut oil advocate

1717 2018-01-30 20:55:25 @AskTSA is coconut oil subject to the liquids rules?
1718 2018-01-30 20:55:23 I'd like to say 'all of the above' but the others were minimally competent at least and possilby less destructive. Though Thatcher formed the context with housing crisis and squandering of oil revenue on rich.

1721 2018-01-30 20:55:07 When oil was king... @SteveWestly telling story about how in 1960s when you went to #LA beaches, you had to bring kerosine to clean the petroleum off your feet. Says think about back then how many of top 10 market cap companies were big oil or automakers. #vx2018 @VerdeXchange

1727 2018-01-30 20:54:24 We've been having oil spills for how long now?  No one seems to care.  Oligarchy rule.
1728 2018-01-30 20:54:12 i like cetaphil. they make face wash and moisturizer i think. i’ve also used ponds moisturizer and it works well. just fuckin load your face up with moisturizer at night. and you can mix oil into your foundation too when you put it on. i use argan oil sometimes.
1729 2018-01-30 20:54:08 Anti-coconut oil'ism(it's not even supposed to be a thing) should be deemed a federal offence, sin, treasonous and blasphemous

1736 2018-01-30 20:53:08 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.

1744 2018-01-30 20:52:17 And most of it is planned replacement or heavy maintenance planned long before @realDonaldTrump  took  office, I see you never worked in oil fool, they plan for years sometimes a decade ahead. #GOPTaxScam
1745 2018-01-30 20:52:04 That really is a Classic truck! May not be suitable for racing, but it's still a good daily driver, & could still haul things. Heck, I wouldn't change a thing about it, not even the original paint job. Only, I'd change the oil & the filters on a regular basis! I'd buy it!
1746 2018-01-30 20:51:57 Dumping toxic waste into the swamp after allowing it by appointing an oil tycoon to the uh... Secretary of state. Oh.
1747 2018-01-30 20:51:36 I’m not taking a piss. An understanding of how Project Finance works regardless of the sector will enable you see this from a different perspective. 

Aiteo Eastern E & P acquisition of OML 29 or Oando’s acquistion of Connoco Philips Oil assets in Nigeria come to mind.
1748 2018-01-30 20:51:35 Okayyyyyy, so I need help on what to use to grow my edges... Please don't suggest 'Hair wonder'.. Used a whole bottle of oil and still little or no difference.

The hustle is real
1749 2018-01-30 20:51:25 Do you have dandruff or dry hair? Coconut oil is your solution.
The oil is wonderful as a face cleanser, moisturizer, and treatment to many skin disorders. The cost is 1300 per Litre and KSH. 650 for 500ml
1750 2018-01-30 20:51:23 I've seen stuff abt not using coconut oil on ur face ??? which ppl argue w/ but I've never used it so who knows
1751 2018-01-30 20:51:11 A stove? Fair enough. Plug in oil radiators for extra heat here... May just go to bed. #hotwaterbottletime

1755 2018-01-30 20:50:41 Ladies who go and get your oil changed, always feel like they get you to buy a new air filter and it always has a brown leaf in it?!?  every single time.
1756 2018-01-30 20:50:40 The easiest way to come to grips with this is to note that a when dilbit arrives at a refinery, the refinery treats it like any other heavy oil. They don't need to change their processes because for them dilbit is simply another heavy crude. 3/
1757 2018-01-30 20:50:37 If you’re going to track then brakes the biggest consumable. Need race pads and cooling, especially if you add more power. And gearbox oil. Check out the price for a gearboxe oil change (£400 for just the oil)

1760 2018-01-30 20:50:23 oil of olay is really legit.
1761 2018-01-30 20:50:10 Be nice to make an arrangement with US states to ship our oil and stop it completely... they can figure out for themselves how they replace the jobs lost.
1762 2018-01-30 20:50:05 Yeah I checked the fluid that same day and it was very low. I added fluid and Lucas oil transmission fix. I think it's a bad o ring. Either way it's under control. Thanks for the response though. Love watching your videos
1763 2018-01-30 20:50:00 We're talking about feminism as a whole not cherry picking! Well I don't see them arguing for more equal divorce settlements, I don't see them arguing for more women on oil rigs, or as refuge workers and sewage work! See how easy it is to cherry pick?!
1764 2018-01-30 20:49:51 Every time I hear the phrase "oil and gas" I have to suppress my gag reflex
1765 2018-01-30 20:49:42 took my car to get 4 new tires, 2 rims and an oil change 
1766 2018-01-30 20:49:35 uh..thats the exact number of the Russia Rex oil deal. jeez..at least try to change that number so you are not so obviously telling a lie. Maybe you just don.t know.treason? much
1767 2018-01-30 20:49:29 Craving red oil spinach, maybe I should cook that today
1768 2018-01-30 20:49:21 If you are truly in favor of banning oil and gas, I assume you are advocating for an immediate ban on all gasoline-burning cars, and oil & gas furnaces in Manitoba.  It would be hypocritical & silly to ban oil production before banning oil usage.
1769 2018-01-30 20:49:20 Oil all over loins
I love oily olive oil

1777 2018-01-30 20:48:31 There is a common misconception (fostered by activists) that dilbit represents a singular, existential threat to the environment. That is not true. Dilbit is another type of heavy oil and behaves just like other heavy oils. 2/
1778 2018-01-30 20:48:24 Olive oil.  Teaspoon per day.

Still patient and waiting for things to calm down. Still trading light and not too exposed
1783 2018-01-30 20:47:55 @MarksReeseWIP So instead of Crisco how about using Coconut Oil!
1784 2018-01-30 20:47:43 Now all of a sudden everybody against coconut oil
1785 2018-01-30 20:47:39 I was at NOAA dealing with the tragedy of DWH for weeks as oil gushed into the Gulf.  I helped keep our fisheries open and safe during the spill.  Then I helped make BP pay to clean up its mess.  This is not right.  Industry can't run the show. @interior do your job #StinkyZinke

moving from the atlantic to mainland europe means all fish here is WEIRD and WRONG tho

1791 2018-01-30 20:46:47 Seems more and more like Oil were walking wounded first half, playing through out of desperation to turn season around
1792 2018-01-30 20:46:44 I’m too gay to check the oil on my car... don’t come for me cos most of y’all don’t even have a license soooo 
1793 2018-01-30 20:46:42 The uncertainties in dilbit are consistent with the uncertainties with most heavy oil spills. As I noted in my piece the science indicates that dillbit behaves like heavy oil in a spill which may be due to the fact that dilbit is simply a type of heavy oil 1/
1794 2018-01-30 20:46:42 You can easily slip in without the need for powder or oil. Also it dries rather quickly after washing...half an hour or so at most.
And it kinda feels smoother cause it doesn't stick anymore.
1795 2018-01-30 20:46:32 Prohibiting spills from happening & being able to contain it with oil booms in case a spill would happen, were part of the reasons to invest in dolphins for StS in our port
1796 2018-01-30 20:46:26 Since the oil came in. Trippier was before then. City ruining the chance for English football to progress. Also you have previously worked at The Times and that explains your awful opinion on football. Please stop.
1797 2018-01-30 20:46:11 So apparently nobody can change the fucking oil in a german car

1812 2018-01-30 20:45:02 @jahanwilcox can I discharge my used motor oil directly into my storm drain? Once it leaves my property, my understanding is that it'll no longer be my problem.

1817 2018-01-30 20:44:20 Definitely happy with ur reporting but yesterday's article re: oil drilling, front page totally sucked. It's great if u don't consider the rape of our water and air and other natural resources as well as our health and destruction of our climate that this industry perpetuates.
1818 2018-01-30 20:44:16 My $100 bottle of Biossance has made me look and feel like a human who has never struggled. But, I know that I can buy pure squalane oil online for $10. :-/
1819 2018-01-30 20:44:16 Of course, but why smoke it if you are sick when the Oil is better for that.. actually heroine acts like morfine if you are in serious physical pain

1849 2018-01-30 20:41:01 Actually it is related to the #globalmarkets and the ending of lawsuits and payments related to the #DeepHorizon oil #disaster. Taxes are NOT the reason. In 6 mos the stock buy back will be the tax reason.

1911 2018-01-30 20:33:23 It's no good asking Russia, as they gave the go ahead in exchange for building Turkey's oil/gas pipeline into Europe.

1954 2018-01-30 20:27:21 After you have your #tape in #extensions installed, wait 72 hours before washing your hair. Always use sulfate-free shampoo & sulfate-free conditioner. More importantly: NEVER apply any hair care products such as hair spray or oil treatments directly on the tapes.
1955 2018-01-30 20:27:20 Of all the face products I've tried, black soap and sweet almond oil have actually changed my life
1956 2018-01-30 20:27:08 I understand the "can't be Texas" sentiment. That said, 1. Cruz 2. Border Wall no Texan wants. 3. We love immigrants. 4. More ppl employed in alt energy than oil/gas.
1957 2018-01-30 20:27:04 Liz Earle is really gd ! I use the shampoo and conditioner like every second time I wash my hair . Also use the hair oil - quite expensive but I’d say it’s worth it x
1958 2018-01-30 20:27:02 UH OK IM 2 READY FOR BLACK PANTHER. I MIGHT STIFF ARM A WHITE WOMAN. BOUTTA STEP IN WEARING A DASHIKI. BOUTTA SMELL LIKE COCONUT OIL AND LOOK LIKE SELF LOVE , FUCK IT. IM BOUT TO GO FULL HOTEP (NOT REALLY THO CUZ YALL NIGGAS BACKWARDS) IM TOO T’D
1959 2018-01-30 20:26:57 Palm oil is vegan and an issue separate to that of veganism. That said, most vegans I know work to reduce or have eliminated their consumption of non-sustainable palm oil.
1960 2018-01-30 20:26:41 Have you found any gold, oil or aliens?
1961 2018-01-30 20:26:32 Cheers, Emre. Ignore all that stuff I may have muttered on Saturday about you being slower than an oil tanker and more bothered about your hair than playing football. I'd had a bit to drink. #LFC
1962 2018-01-30 20:26:31 Which was an asset that the government owned and gave away at a loss. Where did money come from to square the deficit? North Sea Oil. We could have Norwayed that bounty and invested it in long-lasting economic development and social progress. Instead it was used to buy votes.

I’m not saying u’ve been manipulated, lied 2 & sold down the river. I am not at all accusing u of being willfully ignorant & naive by believing a singular cable station. O/c it’s not ur fault u followed the loudest snake oil salesman bully. Not at all.
1964 2018-01-30 20:26:15 Heard that City, have boxes, rows of seats all sponsored by the oil people.
1965 2018-01-30 20:26:14 Waiting for an oil change is like watching grass grow.
1966 2018-01-30 20:25:48 Fuck fuck fuck have to still get gas and oil changed I just wanna take a fucking nap
1967 2018-01-30 20:25:44 I’m sorry it had to come to this Deema. But it’s trash, sweet almond oil is the answer!!!
1968 2018-01-30 20:25:36 Imma get that cause I think I need a mixture of different shit. I been using mango castor oil for a minute now cause I just love the smell so much lmao
1969 2018-01-30 20:25:34 And yes. Gold has 70 years worth of stock/flow. Oil has about 70 days. But according to the analysis, the thousands of tons of phys gold flowing around, is being supplied by mines. Much of it. Joe gold bug or Jeet gold bug in India, is not supplying phys to the market.

1971 2018-01-30 20:25:10 I'm both happy and sad tomorrow is pay day because I have to get my oil changed... pay my already late (again) cable bills, oops... and then I am getting my nails done Thursday and my eyelashes done Saturday. There goes like half my paycheck. WOOF!
1972 2018-01-30 20:24:55 This dude in my platoon smell like hot mayonnaise and motor oil
1973 2018-01-30 20:24:44 Do you really think democrats don’t have plenty of skeletons in their closet?  They are shaking in their boots too. And since they are now such supporters of the non existent state of Palestine, they probably have Arab oil money in their contributions.
1974 2018-01-30 20:24:11 Ask yourself why that is? SNP don’t have a single answer! Snake oil salesmen.

1984 2018-01-30 20:23:06 I stopped using coconut oil and my hair grew so fast and kept the length smh ridiculous
1985 2018-01-30 20:23:05 You use palm oil in your product.  Haven't drank it for 5 yrs.  because I cannot support habitat destruction of native species.  "Oh No No!"  don't kill baboons for a 'creamy' cup of coffee.

1987 2018-01-30 20:22:43 I hope vegans aren't eating Oreos. They contain palm oil.
1988 2018-01-30 20:22:42 Coconut oil does nothing but get cooked in my house. Don’t even use it in my hair. It dries my shit OUT.
1989 2018-01-30 20:22:39 I’m impressed! I try olives every time I go to Spain in the vain hope I’ll one day like them. Love olive oil!
1990 2018-01-30 20:22:37 Nope. He’s a snake oil salesman and a supporter of white Nationalists.
1991 2018-01-30 20:22:30 Oil spills and air pollution Yea!
1992 2018-01-30 20:22:28 I use the tinned channas here, drain the water drizzle olive oil some paprika, salt and cumin powder and roast them in the oven. They come or nice and crispy. Divine!
1993 2018-01-30 20:22:19 On first glance increased oil production in the Permian Basin may be reasonable and appropriate, but, your record as a steward of public lands is so poor that I am very wary. #MonumentsForAll #BearsEars
1994 2018-01-30 20:22:09 Baby oil
1995 2018-01-30 20:21:48  love it. Just keep lotions, powders, and oil away at all time and you will always have a easy clean up. Lol
1996 2018-01-30 20:21:47 Palm oil
1997 2018-01-30 20:21:45 Not you personally, but yea that’s the general idea - bring some reality to what taxpayers can afford and what the union expects.  Abandoning the role of gatekeeper to the public purse seems, nuts. Gov does not control interest rates, or oil prices but they control costs
1998 2018-01-30 20:21:35 Don’t ya love it when a garage fucks up your car while trying to do something as simple as changing the oil? #ffs

2006 2018-01-30 20:20:19 Because as far as I am concerned if you are using coconut oil (for anything besides cooking) chances are you have at least heard of or is using a few of those other oils mentioned. 
2007 2018-01-30 20:20:15 I wanna try flaxseed oil too but I haven't found any in any store.

2009 2018-01-30 20:20:06 Your Excellency, even at the attractive 12%, prospective oil investors demand a stability clause in their contracts. How do we settle this once for all?
2010 2018-01-30 20:20:00 Can we block all people opposed to oil from using any/all oil based products ..... make a reality serious out of so we can watch as they come to the realization that it’s not that simple.  #ThinkingOutLoud

2020 2018-01-30 20:18:59 Don't go near Oshodi. I think Governor Ambode is looking for crude oil there. That's the only reason Wey make sense.
2021 2018-01-30 20:18:43 I gotchu sis. Egg and mayo is for protein not moisture so you can, get aloe vera juice mixed w olive oil, section your hair off & soak each section then use ur favorite oil ( i prefer coconut oil or JMBC) and soak each section then let it sit for 30 mins preferably under heat so
2022 2018-01-30 20:18:43 So my sister’s glamour job doesn’t pay her enough to afford oil, so she hardly ever turns the heat on. if I move the thermostat up to 80, she might have a stroke 

Oil is expensive, I have become comfortable with being cold.
2023 2018-01-30 20:18:40 Same @ oil I use a daily brush spray (basically diluted oil in a spray bottle) and spray a washcloth then clean it a bit on there so my 2 week deep cleaning is easier (and my shadows and blush shades don’t mix) but like that’s not really that important I’m just extra
2024 2018-01-30 20:18:36 re: the article everyone's mad about this week: i'm seeing the argument that "well, people with severe skin problems need skincare" and that's true but the kind of care they need is medication and not the snake oil shit that the article criticizes
2025 2018-01-30 20:18:16 What are the US looking in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq? Daesh? or just making money in oil, diamonds and drugs?

2049 2018-01-30 20:15:33 Easy answer.....NO !!   What $ I just started receiving in my paycheck - $11/ck. Is going to go towards rising oil and gas increase going on.  Playing with AHC is causing my healthcare to become less affordable. Slandering FBI makes me less safe.
2050 2018-01-30 20:15:29 Or you know a bribe, to lift Russian sanctions so they can get going on that trillion dollar oil deal they had with Putic to drill in the Black Sea, you know maybe why they go also want Ukraine, but you care more about money than the Constitution or our democracy.

2052 2018-01-30 20:15:21 They'd immediatly start fighting over the oil.  Nationalism and sectarianism are the big problems, but economics matters too.

2054 2018-01-30 20:15:13 I need an oil change
2055 2018-01-30 20:14:59 Always been intrigued about the impact of oil price on inflation. Looked long and hard at times, but never managed to convince myself that it is a big enough part of the economy to have the impact it is given credit (blame?) for
2056 2018-01-30 20:14:57 fraudchester city , pep fraudiola , don't worry the oil will dry up soon 
2057 2018-01-30 20:14:54 Idk why they compare two different artists on two different ends of the spectrum. That's like comparing vinegar to oil.
2058 2018-01-30 20:14:48 This is not a win the government gives oil companies billions in subsidiesso this means nothing, some people just don’t see this money is not coming back to the people and if it does it’s about time but I doubt it they are going to cut jobs and they banking on that Russia deal

2060 2018-01-30 20:14:44 You know the oil yea? It makes me fucking light headed when i put it on face
2061 2018-01-30 20:14:37 In effect the gov't is saying we should do more spill science because of the increased risk of spills due to the increased volume of material being transported. Which as I point out in my blog post is not entirely true since TMX will displace oil currently travelling by tanker
2062 2018-01-30 20:14:37 Putin and Republicans are allies. Republican donors share Putin's interest in maintaining oil dependency and actually prefer oligarchic government to democracy.

2064 2018-01-30 20:14:31 Horgan already spoke to this, he said when they met @RachelNotley had no intention of persuading him on pipelines. Add in the people she hires and appoints and it is clear she opposes oil development and pipelines, she pretends to support them in an attempt to gain votes
2065 2018-01-30 20:14:30 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

2067 2018-01-30 20:14:21 Don't see why so much importance being given to annual budget presentation of union govt. Excise duty gone from its purview bc of GST. Given precarious state of govt's finances & oil price, not much scope to cut income tax. Merely a presentation of govt's accounts!!

2070 2018-01-30 20:13:54 Yep, they will have water inside them (along with the molecules of interest) which when heated will turn to steam and create high pressure. Will replicate diagenesis but sped up- usually used for oil formation conditions in our lab
2071 2018-01-30 20:13:49 i'm betting they were going to do it regardless comrade leader; w/ the price of oil & state of the art fracking technology, why wouldn't they?

2073 2018-01-30 20:13:40 based on the Sankey Diagram for Canada, oil is the most highly produced energy source and dominates the transport sector, accounting for 91% of the energy consumed for transportation. #Activity #Lesson4
2074 2018-01-30 20:13:38 Great! I hope they put an oil rig or two upwind and upstream of your home!
2075 2018-01-30 20:13:34 You guys haven't got a clue how lucky you are. Gas in the UK is £1.22 per litre - or $7.82 per gallon. And we also have oil.

2085 2018-01-30 20:12:42 Oh, another chemical spill, waterways even not secure - gas and oil.everywhere.
2086 2018-01-30 20:12:35 Can this oil money club let us breathe
2087 2018-01-30 20:12:27 No, it will not.  The price of gas is determined by the global market.  Reality is, in order to cut a profit, domestic drillers need high prices, which is why so many shut down when the price of oil was so low.  You're welcome.

2091 2018-01-30 20:12:07 Recognize the RAS report (The Behaviour and Environmental Impacts of

2095 2018-01-30 20:11:44 Extra. Virgin. Olive. Oil. 
2096 2018-01-30 20:11:39 Lmao  I’ve used coconut oil for my hair recently and I swear to you it’s been growing faster ever since!!
2097 2018-01-30 20:11:37 Dont want a billionaire, want an oil rich  country to buy us and spend billions like Citeh. Dont get this balance the books, net spend nonsense fans spew out. See our best players leave?? ENIC will sell tomorrow for their "right " price.
2098 2018-01-30 20:11:34 I use 1 product that makes the difference: coconut oil. Not because it’s a trend but because I come from a long line of women who have been using nothing but coconut oil. It’s a makeup remover, moisturizer and a sunscreen. One jar cost $4 and last all year for entire body!
2099 2018-01-30 20:11:18 I need a new oil connect...my boy is slacking big time!!!

2100 2018-01-30 20:11:17 The CBD oil would help you sleep! That is a huge reason why my friend uses it. But if weed is working for you for that already then I can see why you wouldn't wanna change it. <3
2101 2018-01-30 20:11:06 It’s a natural oil, everytime i use it i get light headed
2102 2018-01-30 20:11:05 Hair dresser: oh my gosh. What did I tell you? Come in every 3 days for a trim or else all your hair is dead. How do you expect me to fix this?!?

Great Lakes are already in distress, and you have ignored the people for the love of oil.  Despicable! As a nerd, check the statistics of the Lakes!
2127 2018-01-30 20:08:46 He's dividing our country by dismantling trust with controlled media aka Faux news. Constant lies are spread and the fact that this snake oil salesman tells people he's fighting for them they eat it up because unlike his predecessor he's a unique politician.
2128 2018-01-30 20:08:37 I like avacado oil and jojoba.
2129 2018-01-30 20:08:31 That well know pig-man, @pigoftheday (Alfie) tells me that 'they' can even weld under water these days. Helps when they fixing oil rigs. The local 'lido' must be child's play.

2138 2018-01-30 20:07:36 People need all commodities Rick. Which is why we measure their cost. People needed gasoline when oil was $130 a barrel and need it now when it’s $64. So we measure an average basket.

2154 2018-01-30 20:06:14 i worked in skin care for 7 years and there are a LOT of crap products out there that are extremely overpriced and will do nothing for you. Which gives it the air of snake oil( which you can actually buy for your skin). And the prices make it seem elite.
2155 2018-01-30 20:06:00 You do know that there are more jobs in solar than in oil and coal combined, right? Right?
2156 2018-01-30 20:05:49 I have $20 in my bank account but I need to buy jojoba oil b4 I die. Should I do the purchase?
2157 2018-01-30 20:05:49 wtf ive been getting really bad acne recently on my chin and i used rosehip oil lastnight at moisturiser and it looks so much better?????
2158 2018-01-30 20:05:48 Remember that Brexshitters say that Government predictions are always wrong when they use them in future to try and sell some other snake oil policy agenda.
2159 2018-01-30 20:05:15 They have gold.  They can now price key commodities in CNY (China's only short food & oil).  And China's military capabilities are getting very asymmetrical to the US - not as big or sophisticated per se but very effective potentially.

2170 2018-01-30 20:03:13 Mustafa was family friend. I think you're wrong about him & Turkey. I think Turkey just tagged along with US. On his son, he has secret oil deal with Erdogan who much evidence shows was working with ISIS. I don't think Barzani recovers from that now that Erdogan threatens US.

2176 2018-01-30 20:02:15 That feeling drives me insane. I tried the oil thing but now I just get them suctioned when needed.
2177 2018-01-30 20:02:15 I mean, I know people who used coconut oil on their face and it worked, I am not one of those people and I learned that the hard way in December 
2178 2018-01-30 20:02:15 Coconut oil is cool for my hair (in the summer) and body, but NOT for my face. That shit is too heavy for my face.

2213 2018-01-30 19:58:03 Well lots of city fans giving out about wages, not about a manager spending more on defence than Bosnia (the country) and still they moan. Stable the high horse boys enjoy the arabs till the oil dries up
2214 2018-01-30 19:57:55 That's a good question. What does our money do? I used to castigate those who dodge taxes in Uganda but even if everybody paid, it would still benefit the same lawless batch, the oil money awaits the same fate. There's no win whatsoever, not with NRM.

2225 2018-01-30 19:56:52 Also black people can only wear those hairstyles. Their hair is cut out for those kind of styles. Caucasian hair is way different. Black hair require lots of oil, deep conditioning, and it cannot be washed every single day. A wash day is required.

2230 2018-01-30 19:55:41 So basically Pep wants to spend £60m on a six week stop gap or until Sane returns. No doubt @OllieHolt22 and @henrywinter will think these figures are fully justified. I’m taking it that City and all there Oil money don’t have to conform to FFplay 
2231 2018-01-30 19:55:16 LRT: Why I stopped using argan oil on my scalp. It was the reason for my flaky scalp. Read a few natural hair care blogs that warned about using argan oil on the scalp.
2232 2018-01-30 19:54:57 once these oil pants come in, it’s over for you fake artists 
2233 2018-01-30 19:54:44 Maybe was the rise of oil...
2234 2018-01-30 19:54:28 Bout to soak in the tub with my essential oil blend, so the devil [cramps] can get up off me.
2235 2018-01-30 19:54:28 Castor oil
2236 2018-01-30 19:54:24 Those pesky regulations requiring trains carrying oil and chlorine to have good brakes that were holding us all back.
2237 2018-01-30 19:54:22 Coconut oil instead of lotion 
2238 2018-01-30 19:53:34 For those who don’t know coconut oil isn’t necessarily good for you face or scalp as it can clog your pores... 
2239 2018-01-30 19:53:21 They will spend the money on facilities to export oil and gas!
2240 2018-01-30 19:53:02 Yeah! Oven or Fire is good with a bit of olive oil, but you can get some in bulk and roast them yourself. I think people call them Italian Frying Peppers
2241 2018-01-30 19:52:57 Is "Dog on the oil field" something like "Canary in the coal mine?" Dog is concerned, so better stop production until we figure out what's wrong.
2242 2018-01-30 19:52:50 A little almond oil when I remember? Usually right after a shower. Other than that, I'm letting my plunge into decrepitude take its course.

For the record, I don't smear anything on my heart.
2243 2018-01-30 19:52:31 Trump was right, again. #shitholecountry
But a wonderful country according to dimms. Should be high on list of potential vacation spots.
2244 2018-01-30 19:52:21 Two long a list, but here’s a couple reasons..he put in charge of the EPA a Climate Denier..Secretary Of The Interior someone who is to protect the wildlife & environment he puts Zink the Dink an avid trophy hunter & someone who allows oil companies to drill in National Parks
2245 2018-01-30 19:52:19 It's interesting these weakness... especially ahead of the earnings season, likely to be a decent one.
2246 2018-01-30 19:52:16 no fake nutella actually tastes like nutella, not enough car oil :p
2247 2018-01-30 19:52:14 Lack also ran into the cultural divide of Bill Peters; Peters is a worker bee guy; not extremely creative; meat & potatoes, crop top haircut guy; probably lines his shoes in the closet by color & type; Lack has Taco tattoos; no way that was going to work; oil & water
2248 2018-01-30 19:52:10 I’m getting an oil change so I wanna debate while i’m waiting. What’s something we can argue about?
2249 2018-01-30 19:52:09 What did you think was going to happen with austerity? You think the pain stops at Berwick? And oil prices had nothing to do with austerity. I'm pointing out that compared to the increadible incompetence of WM, we're lucky to have had the SNP in power during that shambles.
2250 2018-01-30 19:52:06 I ain’t got no gas & going get a oil change lol
2251 2018-01-30 19:52:04 Looked at the ingredients today in my @grazedotcom protein bar.  And was shocked to read it contains Palm oil.  Won’t be purchasing again. #savetherainforests #saynotopalmoil
2252 2018-01-30 19:51:54 We use vast majority Rapeseed oil that is high in Omega 3 and low in saturated fat. The tiny amount of palm we use in fully sustainable & RSPO certified.
2253 2018-01-30 19:51:40 yes and yes, there’s a good Burt’s Bees one that i like!! just be mindful of ingredients because sometimes they can cause fordyce dots which aren’t going to hurt you- it’s excess oil trapped under the skin (which can also happen with lip products and a variety of other things)
2254 2018-01-30 19:51:37 Sure, sounds like they are negotiating budget using oil sharing and maybe reduce tensions in Kirkuk by removing the militias.
2255 2018-01-30 19:51:30 What about palm oil they use!!?
2256 2018-01-30 19:51:21 Oil Rig City. 
2257 2018-01-30 19:51:20 I'm not a nerd, but when I saw the news about the province's new oil spill regulation, I almost yelped in class
2258 2018-01-30 19:51:17 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
2259 2018-01-30 19:51:16 I get it. I'll be dipping into some of them then once we finish this fall. Now.......as you say. Back to oil. Nice day today. Reality is only beginning to assert itself. I don't have my charts now, but my suspicion is we fall until between 58-59, then move up, then down 47 :)
2260 2018-01-30 19:51:08 Because the #indy White Paper assumption of a worst case oil revenue, which was out by over a factor of 10, was not wilfully exposing its citizens to economic risk? 
2261 2018-01-30 19:50:34 And please let them clog their pores with organic cold pressed coconut oil, too.
2262 2018-01-30 19:50:26 And what does our money and resources do? I am not even sure about the oil hype that he was talking about.
2263 2018-01-30 19:50:24 Oil ends sharply lower as production concerns dog
2264 2018-01-30 19:50:22 Getting my oil change and my car inspected everything is A1  love my 2017 
2265 2018-01-30 19:50:21 I predicted this last week fibanaci makes no mistake in correction range so listen to events news : feds rate hike always makes bond yield higher hence lowering stock prices;if inflation is to be controlled ; look at oil prices does that answer u ?
2266 2018-01-30 19:50:08 is part of the $50b US to build a new pipeline to St John cutting out Canadian Oil completely @awudrick
2267 2018-01-30 19:50:05 One of my workers swear by coconut oil for her face and yet her face is always oily and breaking out???
2268 2018-01-30 19:50:00 The melanzane sammy, roasted & marinated eggplant, peppers, portabellas (garlic oil, herbs, vinegar), roasted garlic ricotta, basil, spinach, ciabatta roll
2269 2018-01-30 19:49:58 It's one of the ones that's stored in the fridge. Has a purple label. I often just fry some veggies that I like in a pan with some olive oil. Tuna salad is the best when you don't know what to make. Or pre-make a frittata in the oven for when I'm in a rush

Yeah I haven’t gotten my vagina’s oil changed in awhile myself!
2272 2018-01-30 19:49:20 Come on @ManCity swoop Riyad up just to watch all these rags melt under the OIL MONEY #RuiningFootball #WeDontCare #OilMoneyFC
2273 2018-01-30 19:49:19 Lol why people say coconut oil don’t work for them?  My skin always poppin, scalp all moisturized y’all hatin 
2274 2018-01-30 19:49:19 Oil money fc.
2275 2018-01-30 19:49:09 How much oil drilling will they do for Russia?
2276 2018-01-30 19:49:08 BC gov't announces list of new oil spill regulations, including a proposal to restrict increased shipment of diluted bitumen -- which complicates Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain expansion. #bcpoli
2277 2018-01-30 19:49:00 君を揚げたいな…君を炒めたいな…君に僕を絡めたいな…僕は君のそんな存在になりたい。いや、既になってるだろう?
2278 2018-01-30 19:48:50 Great point. Also don’t think the oil price can be overlooked. Even if the $ fades some, there is much more confidence now that prices should stay above $50. That’s huge for tight oil.
2279 2018-01-30 19:48:28 Yeah. rUK will be fucked. Oil only reason £ is staying afloat.
2280 2018-01-30 19:48:08 She's never had marijuana in her life and was hesitant, but he explained the difference between the effects cbd oil and just smoking it and she tried it and will never go back.
2281 2018-01-30 19:48:05 I’m about to make your mind blow up.. did y’all know that dry shampoo is meant to be used when your hair is clean and not when it gets greasy? It prevents oil, not soak it up. #iknowyourmindisblownurwelcome
2282 2018-01-30 19:47:54 Lets be honest. Oil majors are basically banks at this point in terms of 'core competency'. Raising money and deploying it is what they actually do. They outsource everything else. Dino's don't have to die...
2283 2018-01-30 19:47:51 not sure why we're talking skincare, but some Kiehl's Oil Eliminator right after a shave will get your face red, nude and mad online. And then happy again shortly thereafter.

2286 2018-01-30 19:47:06 A friend if mine had a grandmother sho has terrible hip problems and can't leave the house much and won't take prescription meds because she knows those drugs are toxic over time. She was 80 when he introduced her to a CBD oil pen and she says she hasn't felt so good in years
2287 2018-01-30 19:46:48 Yep. Car fuel is definitely poison. Too strong like car oil
2288 2018-01-30 19:46:30 Painful...
2289 2018-01-30 19:46:20 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
2290 2018-01-30 19:46:16 For him to say we are reentering Paris agreement- giving up on the stupid wall- forging a path of citizenship for #DREAMers - reestablishing #BearsEars not allowing oil drilling along our coastline and fixing the #affordablecareact -so nothing basically
2291 2018-01-30 19:46:13 you and the rest of the Pimple Posse can leave my mentions

2292 2018-01-30 19:46:10 An oil barrel sold..
2293 2018-01-30 19:46:05 Don’t forget neem oil! 
2294 2018-01-30 19:45:50 This map makes it obvious why Trump is so popular. Roll backs on restrictions for forestry, and gas and water, crude oil, coil miners and we'll Alabama needs no explanation.
2295 2018-01-30 19:45:45 The Mandarin Cleansing Oil is a great choice. It’s such a lovely alternative to traditional cleansers (plus it smells amazing)! I hope you love it when you try it!
2296 2018-01-30 19:45:41 Dude ur actually trying to make a case for City’s spending 

It’s a fake club pumped financially by oil money. United make their own money, and have still won more than you since Mansour took over 

£500m in 18 months LOL 

Playing real life FIFA haha
2297 2018-01-30 19:45:35 Not for oil city ..
2298 2018-01-30 19:45:34 You’re welcome! The tea tree oil Castile soap (orange bottle) would be your best bet. Tea tree oil is great for oily skin.
2299 2018-01-30 19:45:21 Plus Tillerson has a relationship with Putin & financial interests in oil/having sanctions lifted so Exxon can sell equip to Russia. Rex has Never had our country’s best interests at heart
2300 2018-01-30 19:45:06 My sisters, (& I) were raised by my dad & his friends Ex mil Oil roughnecks Construction wrkrs ect They're are about as strong as you ever saw The male / female frames have different strengths & weakness but the sum of the parts equals the same IMHO
2301 2018-01-30 19:45:04 @kevintaftab Ph.D. Business has recently released "Oil's Deep State: How the petroleum industry undermines democracy and stops action on global warming - in Alberta and in Ottawa" . A succinct and factually supported analysis. Disturbing 
2302 2018-01-30 19:45:00 Billions? He's proven to be a great snake oil salesman, can't deny that. Terrible manager, weak leadership, but yes great at hyping himself
2303 2018-01-30 19:44:48 i see people spend insane $$ on skincare all the time (and i'm guilty of it myself) but my skin is never better than when i lightly douse it with witch hazel and moisturize with coconut oil. expensive skincare is silly!
2304 2018-01-30 19:44:42 Takes big money from Pharma, oil;

Keep this up, Dems and you’ll ensure Trump’s second term. Way to go!
2305 2018-01-30 19:44:18 wewhat is the rest of the world got to do with how good the governace of the teh SNP is. Yes, oil prices crashed, austerity hit in to pay for greed (think of RBS), but when I got to watch the pennies,  schools are worse, police merge was a mess, & no inward investment
2306 2018-01-30 19:44:18 And ruining rainforest everywhere with their quest for Palm Oil
2307 2018-01-30 19:44:14 Yeah put some drops of tea tree oil in your shampoo. Don't use tea tree oil undiluted though x
2308 2018-01-30 19:44:12 Mirriam is just another one of those pseudo-intellectuals that is educated in ONE single field and in practice, is stupid... just like Obama. Mirriam, can you find your oil dipstick, change a light bulb, find a constellation in the sky, perform long mathematics in your head... ??
2309 2018-01-30 19:44:12 I understand the corporate consolidation, but does oil have an impact on this chart as those corporates were a lead driving indicator in the 70's through the 90's.

2313 2018-01-30 19:43:52 I loved the oil . So has it gone now?
2314 2018-01-30 19:43:39 The opposite also works for "Do City fans enjoy watching people froth at the mouth about oil money and net spend?"
2315 2018-01-30 19:43:35 THE OIL FROM THIS PLANT WILL HEAL/REVERSE STAGE 4 CANCERS EVEN LUNG AND BRAIN  

AND YOU ASK ME WHY IT IS ILLEGAL IF IT HEALS LIKE THAT 

CHEMO IS DEADLY but brings in 30,000 a month per person but if a plant heals you chemo is extinct and gravy train stops.
2316 2018-01-30 19:43:27 I"m one of the few people who would like to go to Barrow, Alaska to see the Northern Lights. Before the oil companies completely ruin it.
2317 2018-01-30 19:43:24 Coconut oil is only good for cooking & taking your makeup off... THEN WASHING YOUR FACE  stop using that shit on y’all face as a moisturizer
2318 2018-01-30 19:43:07 elon musk is a snake oil salesman and should be first against the wall
2319 2018-01-30 19:43:06 Kansas seriously wants to make CBD oil illegal & if you use or have it you will be charged with possession just like marijuana. I am unbelievably disappointed in my state.
2320 2018-01-30 19:42:58 Due to the worsening weather, our offices and galleries are closing today at 4pm. Scheduled workshops for this evening, Handbuilt Pottery and Intro to Oil Painting, have been postponed.
We hear it's getting slippery and visibility is worsening - stay safe!
2321 2018-01-30 19:42:53 I just made Pad Thai for myself, but I made the horrible, HORRIBLE mistake of following the instructions and cooking the dried chili peppers in oil before adding the noodles..... Oh my gosh my mouth is on fire.
2322 2018-01-30 19:42:44 the one who leads is the one who is most familiar with the path ahead

this is a natural, subconscious pattern
2323 2018-01-30 19:42:26 i'm very intrigued and just did a google search for this SR UFO oil. Is it applied once a day (in the morning)? my skin sometimes thinks i'm back in HS =(
2324 2018-01-30 19:42:10 Parsley: "While sustained oil price strength would bias expectations toward the higher end of the previously issued guidance... given the likelihood of service inflation, the Company expects that it would be accompanied by a disproportionate increase in cash flow generation."
2325 2018-01-30 19:42:00 Easier said than done. This was his first foray into acquiring an oil asset producing 9,000bopd. An asset that the National Oil Body was interested in. That’s no mean feat. Maybe cause of my Finance background, I’m looking at this from a different side of the prism.
2326 2018-01-30 19:41:55 I would ask for 75m. the greedy man's will pay from the bottomless oil pit.
2327 2018-01-30 19:41:40 I used my new natural face oil, natural deodorant, AND I took all my vitamins today? Hello, it’s me, a new bitch 
2328 2018-01-30 19:41:38 coconut oil is TERRIBLE for your skin and y’all still use it lmao
2329 2018-01-30 19:41:17 We're following you on the 'sustainable' palm oil, so decided against the McSween veg haggis this year.
2330 2018-01-30 19:41:16 I DO know those crappy TJ Maxx oils suck no matter what. But it would be ignorant to say all young living oils are safe because it’s just the plant. If that plant was generally toxic to cats, of course the oil would not be good to use around cats.
2331 2018-01-30 19:41:15 Mahrez obviously wants to be paid in oil money.
2332 2018-01-30 19:40:54 So who's the Male Kim Kardashian with his no talent, reality show having, no reason attention-getting, nude taking, sex tape shooting, sub-par product selling, cameo paid, no reason mag cover, talent marrying, out of left field kid naming, oil inflate ass anyway? #Equality4All

2334 2018-01-30 19:40:43 So on one hand, I love smelling like a citrus-y delight and being a glittering extra in Twilight, but on the other hand, ow ow ow, orange oil + injuries don't mix, ow.
2335 2018-01-30 19:40:43 No doubt, but seizing Azerbaijan oil fields would've cut the bears legs off. German's best game all along was blitzkrieg & maneuver.
2336 2018-01-30 19:40:29 Coconut oil never did a damn thing for me
2337 2018-01-30 19:40:22 あいて…ちょっとエルザにスリーサイズ聞いただけなのに殴られた…
2338 2018-01-30 19:40:20 Under our ownership of @SUFCOfficial we would immediately install an Iranian dictator in charge.

Not only would there be insane amounts of oil money, the Ayers would be frightened into putting in the performances over fear of beheading.

2342 2018-01-30 19:39:40 Tip of the day: your oil diffusers are poisoning your animals
2343 2018-01-30 19:39:32 Do you know that if you remove oil revenue from the figures, the Nigerian economy has been in recession since 1969?

2344 2018-01-30 19:39:31 You are so welcome! Oh, fish oil supplements help too! Good luck and welcome to the #psoriasis club.

2346 2018-01-30 19:38:58 Boy that oil that you used made all the difference
2347 2018-01-30 19:38:56 America is ranked #3 in consumption of plastics and rubbers. Statistics show most of those byproducts come from natural gas? (Needs a little more clarity) Not much is produced from crude oil anymore. Then what is? Only 3% is gas. What's the other stuff being made from crude oil?
2348 2018-01-30 19:38:46 Don't you think this is unscientific? And who is going to pay for this ? Why use governments fund for such functions ?We are climbing on Hunger index scale and wasting of oil and ghee in such way is highly condemnable .
2349 2018-01-30 19:38:46 plotting where to drill so you and #TraitorTillerson  get rich off the oil?  no one cares what you say or do anymore- you betrayed your State and our Country by Voting Yes on the #BillionaireBill #PleaseResign
2350 2018-01-30 19:38:41 United make the money they spend. City don’t. So the buy an oil business point makes no sense. That’s my point.
2351 2018-01-30 19:38:25 Getting my oil changed 
2352 2018-01-30 19:38:21 and offshore oil with NFLD

2356 2018-01-30 19:37:45 Just being using the oil since I use a CC cream for moisturizer/sunscreen. (PeterThomasRoth - same as my fav masks).
2357 2018-01-30 19:37:42 No, it is not. But continuing to use coal and oil is not viable either.
2358 2018-01-30 19:37:40 And what does he call the Democrats selling their country out by attempting to corrupt the Justice Department? Joe is no different than Bill was...a red neck snake oil salesman.
2359 2018-01-30 19:37:30 All of it Tony. Turbine housing, core and compressor are three separate pieces which can all rotate into any position, two stainless water cooling pipes, wastegate actuator adjustment, oil feed, tight clearances!
2360 2018-01-30 19:37:16 jojoba is technically not an oil at all, did ya know that
2361 2018-01-30 19:37:06 You are very welcome.  I know people whose hair has also grown longer with a potent anti oxidant and mineral.  Make sure to get a fish oil that is clean and free of Mercury and other toxins
2362 2018-01-30 19:37:06 This past year has been a disaster the deregulation will lead to a proliferation of Superfund sites that will be cleaned up by the taxpayer the elimination of the $0.09 per barrel tax on oil to clean oil spills will cost the taxpayer billions in the long term
2363 2018-01-30 19:37:02 Giroud should want to join Dortmund. A lot of beards in Germany need to know about his oil. #AFC #BVB

2372 2018-01-30 19:35:38 Dating A Married Man Is Fun Until You Discover He Saved Your Number As Engine Oil.

2374 2018-01-30 19:35:12 Norway. They invested the wealth of north sea oil wisely. Thatcher chose instead to lower taxes to benefit corporations and the wealthy.

2380 2018-01-30 19:34:32 Back home. Defrosted chicken breasts ... wanted to fry them but have no vegetable oil........ Lordt I hate cooking everyday
2381 2018-01-30 19:34:08 Yes, then why are you cutting staff while raising prices for entry if your energy production is so profitable.  Of course, with coal mines & oil wells covering public lands, the number of visitors will decline.
2382 2018-01-30 19:34:04 Emperor Alexander II - "Russia has only two allies - our army and fleet."
President Putin - Russia has only 4 allies - the army, the fleet, oil, and gas.
That's why more than 65% of Russians support Putin.
2383 2018-01-30 19:33:50 I mean, I don't understand the science of it, but I agree. I felt something trying to sneak up on me and Thieves oil killed it in a day.
2384 2018-01-30 19:33:36 inject coconut oil into your heart. fucking. jam it in there. fuck. fucking. bathe in it. stick your face in it. fucking. coconut oil RAW
2385 2018-01-30 19:33:30 what i did was, acrylic and oil on canvass and it's a total failure

2388 2018-01-30 19:33:13 Jojoba oil doesn't clog pores and fights bacteria
2389 2018-01-30 19:33:09 went over this yesterday,,,,, the leader of china became the communist party leader for life, putin is a despot..... money traded for oil will not change but i understand your argument..... nixon took us off the gold standard that was good, #MMT study
2390 2018-01-30 19:33:06 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
2391 2018-01-30 19:33:01 Fish oil, grape seed extract are great for hair skin and nail health
2392 2018-01-30 19:32:59 My dad told me he’s had enough of my shit.. I have to go and buy oil, and has yet to pay me for my day I took off from work to drive him to Dallas. Boi I could of had enough to buy to lay last me idk like 2 months SMH

2395 2018-01-30 19:32:40 vitamin e oil saved my life
2396 2018-01-30 19:32:39 Tea tree oil
2397 2018-01-30 19:32:27 Perhaps that is something that should be looked into. Why it wasn't done during the original oil boom is beyond me.
2398 2018-01-30 19:32:25 C. Olive Oil
2399 2018-01-30 19:32:19 i gotta get up and shower, eat, etc but my body hurtsss
i'm just gonna have some ibuprofen and cbd oil and lay back down for a bittt
2400 2018-01-30 19:32:16 It’s an anti fungal and anti bacterial it will be a hit or miss for anyone’s face. Not everyone’s face can handle an oil like that. It worked for me too had my face booty smooth. Have you tried avocado oil?
2401 2018-01-30 19:32:10 i use a vitamin c serum in addition to my oil free moisturizer :)

jojoba is great for my hair but still way too heavy for my face. my fave hair oil is actually grapeseed mixed with castor oil. i use coconut oil all over my body though lol.
2402 2018-01-30 19:32:08 It's honestly the coolest experience. Take the boat to see the sunken ship, it still is leaking oil to this day. Super moving.

2405 2018-01-30 19:32:01 everybody can’t be blessed with such magnificent skin

2406 2018-01-30 19:31:53 U.S. CRUDE OIL FUTURES SETTLE AT $64.50/BBL, DOWN $1.06, 1.62 PCT
2407 2018-01-30 19:31:49 I make my own. Just a solution of water and lemon oil.
2408 2018-01-30 19:31:48 If the intent is to spur production then better methodology would be to provide incentives maybe combined with gradually increasing tariffs. As is, this just causes job losses since we cannot currently meet demand and appears to be an indirect, functional subsidy to coal and oil.
2409 2018-01-30 19:31:44 I legit hate getting an oil change They take too long!
2410 2018-01-30 19:31:37 Who told y’all to put coconut oil in yall face?

2412 2018-01-30 19:31:34 Broken Coast has CBD oil again 
2413 2018-01-30 19:31:31 City are merely where they are due to 8 years or money. No home grown players. No proper history. No build. Nothing. Pep has spent 530m in 18 months. Adding to the 2.1bn since 2009 - they have nothing without the oil men. Chequechester City #MCFC #MAHREZ
2414 2018-01-30 19:31:28 This is a speculative project that will only come into the pipeline if the oil future remains high (above 80 USD per baril) or if there is a major discovery in Eritrea or Somalia. ln this case, the additional volume will make the investment in a liquefaction plant profitable.
2415 2018-01-30 19:31:27 He wanted to allow oil drilling in a pristine Alaska watershed. Cancelled by the EPA. Drilling off of Florida is cancelled. Other states are applying; NH, NY, Calif, Ore, etc. His revised corrected travel bill is coming for his abuses of gov’t aircraft, etc.
2416 2018-01-30 19:31:20 Yes, confluence of fracking, horizontal drilling, $100/bbl oil, lifting of export ban, banks eager to lend money to midcontinent oil companies and those companies starved for cash to pay those debts. Fracking and horizontal wells made shale economically feasible
2417 2018-01-30 19:31:17 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
2418 2018-01-30 19:31:11 @GOP @SpeakerRyan @SenateMajLdr @VP @realDonaldTrump 

You are nothing but a bunch of snake oil/used car/timeshare salesman, the entire world sees through this admin & political party!! You are not well liked, to put it mildly!

2419 2018-01-30 19:30:50 I think I finally figured out a skin care routine: Clinique cleansing oil, any drugstore face wash/scrub, Glossier solution, Drunk Elephant vitamin c serum in the AM and Drunk Elephant glycolic serum in PM, Josie Maran argan oil moisturizer in AM and Origin Nite-a-mins oil in PM
2420 2018-01-30 19:30:46 So you'd stick with who we have rather than take "oil money" should that be an option.
2421 2018-01-30 19:30:43 But Pruitt doesn't care so long as he can use Trump to enable the monied oil and coal interests that have bought him.

2425 2018-01-30 19:30:27 Especially in a country that exports oil to other countries, what is it going to take for somebody to wake up and find a permanent solution to this problem.
Does anyone of you guys even care about this National embarrassing problem?
2426 2018-01-30 19:30:25 OK  you complained about the oil money and I advise United should go into oil business so that they can compete... What did I say wrong???
2427 2018-01-30 19:30:18 Coconut oil really does wonders for my skin and hair especially, everyone should be on the wave trussss
2428 2018-01-30 19:30:10 Re: My tweet of 7 hrs ago,"fuel" like wood,oil,gas...etc, is included under need #1 in a metaphorical way. Just as we say food & drink is "fuel" for the body; so we can say fuel of whatever kind is "food & drink" for our inventions and technology. Food & fuel therefore are as one
2429 2018-01-30 19:29:41 I was up in Williston this year for a while, those oil field works between 25-35 make what? 45,000 on call with OT
2430 2018-01-30 19:29:35 Time to mute that coconut oil tweet. Folks OD’ing in the replies.
2431 2018-01-30 19:29:31 Need to stop kidding myself with 1 cal oil spray when I just spray it like 20 times
2432 2018-01-30 19:29:26 Getting an oil change & oddly sated
2433 2018-01-30 19:29:24 If oil & gas wasn't propped up by crony capitalism it would have faded out 15-20 yrs ago! Thankfully the 8track & cassette industry didn't have lobbyists!
2434 2018-01-30 19:29:20 Also keeps the oil rig outta my back yard as well.
2435 2018-01-30 19:29:14 Yes, City owners are rolling in oil so they will buy every player available and trophies! It’s a luxury that other EPL teams don’t have
2436 2018-01-30 19:29:11 Retweeted, thank you  #Gold #Oil
2437 2018-01-30 19:29:02 From a security standpoint I think we are very vulnerable. Can’t fly an F16 on 87 octane fuel nor run a tank on heating oil. #qualitymatters @Big_Orrin also all we heard about in 14 was Cushing over flowing   Feels good to be hearing about Cushing again...

2441 2018-01-30 19:28:43 The oil and gas industry employees many Americans with good paying jobs and benefits. Our country would be in a huge bind if it wasn't for the industry.
2442 2018-01-30 19:28:34 @AlyaaGad tea tree oil ممتاز جدا، جربته من سنابك.. ألف شكر.
2443 2018-01-30 19:28:13 I oil this thang up like 3 times a day, either grape seed oil or avocado oil

2445 2018-01-30 19:28:13 I love your range but especially your olive oil  the Mediterranean diet is the healthiest diet in the world and I would love to use your products to try out some new healthy recipes 
2446 2018-01-30 19:28:00 Natural skin oil tho  best highlight haha
2447 2018-01-30 19:27:58 I though I was Gordon Ramsay tried to flip a steak in a pan of hot oil, I now have got 3rd degree burns on my face
2448 2018-01-30 19:27:56 Lest you forget, Trump promotes African "shit holes" as long as they well lubricated with oil - think of Tillerson's favorite,  little Equatorial Guinea.
2449 2018-01-30 19:27:53 Rosehip seed oil is great.
2450 2018-01-30 19:27:44 wait biscuits have palm oil?
2451 2018-01-30 19:27:34 Do you also remember that oil price fell before our budget was ready and oil(brent) sold continuously above the benchmark of the budget, yet the implementation of the budget is nothing to write about?
2452 2018-01-30 19:27:33 So says the Snake Oil salesman if your Twitter bio is anything to go by
2453 2018-01-30 19:27:28 Oil is not going down until after the Aramco IPO. We have known about this run up for over a year now.
2454 2018-01-30 19:27:18 @Mahrez22 don't go akhi it's a trap, stay away from the oil money bruv

2460 2018-01-30 19:26:58 Already have a PST. Of course it is called the Carbon Tax. It is being used to make big oil innovative. Why not use the C Tax for paying the bills of gov? Doubt we will go for another PST when gov needs to cut it's compensation including politician pay and perks. Start with GOA.
2461 2018-01-30 19:26:56 I’m obsessed w their marula oil
2462 2018-01-30 19:26:54 God bless you all. What a great story and beautiful family! Have you ever asked about CBD oil?  It helps so many.  Just a thought. GOD BLESS!
2463 2018-01-30 19:26:47 when you can’t remember the name of a disease do you write “the one from that movie with susan sarandon and the olive oil”
2464 2018-01-30 19:26:42 Yes. Insurance is for catastrophic stuff, Not care. You don't get auto insurance to cover an oil change. When Insurance Co.'s stop paying for CARE, & are there only for RISK, then the price goes down. If you do the math, DPC is still more affordable & much better.
2465 2018-01-30 19:26:30 Aquaculture on the shores will be dead if they build off shore oil drilling platforms.
2466 2018-01-30 19:26:24 my CBD oil cost more than stank, but..alas..the things I have to do

2479 2018-01-30 19:25:01 I am the opposite! I have a grease face and most everything I've tried just sits on my face like ...like I dipped myself in olive oil or something
2480 2018-01-30 19:25:00 Tip of the day: Be very, very careful sitting down on the toilet after you’ve rubbed yourself down with body oil.
2481 2018-01-30 19:25:00 I love getting my oil changed at take5 in Hammond. I get in and out quick and always get flirted with. Go get a self esteem boost and keep your car up to date lol
2482 2018-01-30 19:24:56 if i can swallow pure oil of oregano there's not much else i can't do really

2484 2018-01-30 19:24:52 Thanks to cbd oil I'm living again :) 
Its great to feel better and even if I get sick I still feel happy Lol :)
2485 2018-01-30 19:24:48 Y u saying 150 mill for a player  adding wage on a price is just pure class from an oil rig club
2486 2018-01-30 19:24:26 Oil rich clubs hoard players that they don’t need. Players go there because their ego thinks they’ll play. 
What happened to FIFA fair play btw?
2487 2018-01-30 19:24:26 Les filles dans la gamme Tea Tree Oil de Body Shop c’est quoi je dois prendre pour les tâches ?
2488 2018-01-30 19:24:24 Me either though it’s pretty pointless for me. I live near a oil refinery and across the water is a naval base and a power plant I’m basically doomed.
2489 2018-01-30 19:24:10 I have v dry skin, so my thing is if it comes in oil form, that's what I get.

2502 2018-01-30 19:23:07 Appreciate you love your club but it's wrong mate. You've been bought by an Arab Oil State, its no longer a Manchester club. Where is this going to end? Absolute joke.
2503 2018-01-30 19:23:01 @SevenSeaslife what is the purpose of fractionated vegetable oil in your maximum strength cod liver oil liquid? Please can you explain the  health of this ingredient and any potential negative health impacts this may have.
2504 2018-01-30 19:22:26 Good!  Oil development means drilling and fracking in sensitive ecosystems.  We should be developing renewable energy programs and infrastructure and better renewable energy education to teach marketable new skills to our children for a sustainable future.

2515 2018-01-30 19:21:34 I didn't say we weren't important. We buy loads from them. It just so happens most of it is oil and zero tariffed regardless.
2516 2018-01-30 19:21:30 Spencer, the question you should ask yourself is at what oil/gas price levels will E&Ps/Oil Svc co's start generating + net income
2517 2018-01-30 19:21:25 $200 oil change
2518 2018-01-30 19:21:24 Refinery or oil field
2519 2018-01-30 19:21:22 Do you actually have a beard to oil???
2520 2018-01-30 19:21:19 Oil. Chop, fry, stir! EASY
2521 2018-01-30 19:20:57 Lmao... who said something about oil... bitch you cooking?
2522 2018-01-30 19:20:56 You know that you have just been visited by a friend with a "proper" Land Rover as there are now oil spots on my drive :-) 
2523 2018-01-30 19:20:49 I Have Read It. And I’m Motivated To See How I Can Buy Shell Or Google By Age 27. It Has To Be Something In The Oil Sector Or Tech Industry 
2524 2018-01-30 19:20:48 Garlic sauteed in olive oil, fresh tomato vines, freshly torn basil; not only do they smell amazing but they’re also the smells of my childhood.
2525 2018-01-30 19:20:43 BS. If the Obama admin CIA didn’t work with Mossad & Saudis to create/train/arm ISIS, there would be no ISIS. Isis is a creation of western intel agencies in order to control an oil pipeline through Syria. Come on @theintercept !
2526 2018-01-30 19:20:41 Ren, almond oil, witch hazel, cetaphil I forget what else
2527 2018-01-30 19:20:40 Is he the Son of the Venezuelan Citizens Oil Agent, Joe Kennedy?
2528 2018-01-30 19:20:39 You’re all wrong take olive oil, slather all over, then scrape it off like ancient Greeks...use excess for cooking
2529 2018-01-30 19:20:36 try jojoba oil instead or a vitamin c serum @alexandrianeas
2530 2018-01-30 19:20:24 I'm at the doc bout to have this lil nerve procedure done & they told me not to put on lotion or oil...I'm ashy as fuck!
2531 2018-01-30 19:20:21 That guy is the biggest bullshitter and scammer I have ever seen. Every time I happen to accidentally notice what this snake oil salesman of a promoter is doing, I'm appalled.
2532 2018-01-30 19:20:18 Shhhh....Americans aren't supposed to know. China & India bought up half of all physical gold on market in 2017. China has huge gold reserves. Russia has huge oil deposits. Now we have Shanghai Energy Exchance,gold-backed pet rubles & yuan.
2533 2018-01-30 19:20:16 Namon ordered me an essential oil diffuser & im just trynna figure out how he knew I wanted one
2534 2018-01-30 19:20:07 This is getting very boring now. I’ll pop in caps for ease. UNITED MAKE THEIR MONEY FROM REVENUE, NOT FROM OIL! Is that clear enough?
2535 2018-01-30 19:20:00 /rlt/ essential oil dari young living/ organic supply co?why?
2536 2018-01-30 19:19:46 Originally each dollar was backed up by a reserve of 1 oz of silver, or 1/50 oz of gold I believe.  Of course the reserve concept now is archaic since no reserves to speak of is just funny money unless you consider it to have an oil reserve behind it backed up by military(petro$)
2537 2018-01-30 19:19:45 Follow the lead of the two companies with multi-billion market caps, that know the o&g industry, that have partnered with us. #NTOG #oil #producer #Cashflow

2539 2018-01-30 19:19:22 @BraunStrowman can mix oil and water #BraunFacts
2540 2018-01-30 19:19:22 If he's such a great manager, why has he spent Half a BILLION quid in 18 months?! This is destroying football. A club owned by an Arab Oil State. Give me my football back please. #arsenal #SCFCvAFC
2541 2018-01-30 19:19:20 Don’t worry mate. They’ll still be pumping oil there &raking in the money long after the Glazers go bust & the banks flog Old Trafford to build an Ikea & Burger King.

2543 2018-01-30 19:19:12 My face oily af. I don’t need to be putting any kind of oil on it
2544 2018-01-30 19:19:07 nixon lbj library tapes youtube fyi,  generally reliable statement, this is for oil companies profit, gaddafi was good for his tribe .... against imperialisms. the problem was there a 4 tribes in that country.... petro dollars wars a sign of fascism
2545 2018-01-30 19:19:03 Rosehip oil from The Ordinary!!
2546 2018-01-30 19:18:53 Bill Nye is a modern day snake oil salesman!
2547 2018-01-30 19:18:50 It might be worth explaining that there is a big difference in north sea oil and gas having a viable medium term future as apposed to generating billions in revenue.
2548 2018-01-30 19:18:46 It's a good question - one I can't really answer! I only spoke to a few folks internationally, and don't want to speak out of turn. One thing: Emission factors by the EPA and the oil industry are sometimes used outside of the US, too, & some similar issues exist other places also
2549 2018-01-30 19:18:33 the funny thing about tea tree oil is that it doesn't treat acne for everyone, i've tried using it for my acne for years and it has never made a difference while for others it's all that works. I only use it once in a while still because I love the smell hehe.
2550 2018-01-30 19:18:31 When you say "Oil Crisis" to What are YOU referring?"
2551 2018-01-30 19:18:29 As Oklahoma Attorney General, Pruitt sued the EPA 14 times. The oil and gas industry showered him with over $300,000 in campaign contributions.
2552 2018-01-30 19:18:22 - someone in here smells like tea tree oil & I love it.
2553 2018-01-30 19:18:15 @1a is he familiar with Stanford futursist Tony Seba's Clean Disruption prediction that in ten to fifteen years our needs will drop to the point that fracking, shale oil and offshore resources will be priced out? (Many Seba talks on YouTube)
2554 2018-01-30 19:18:14 Man city out here buying everybody..... they're lucky they have oil money
2555 2018-01-30 19:18:09 Oil is renewable, just takes longer.
2556 2018-01-30 19:17:56 I’ll come over as soon as my dad changes my oil 
2557 2018-01-30 19:17:56 I’ve been seeing people say coconut oil is trash and shouldn’t be used on their face 

HA!!! Sucks for y’all that y’all have shitty skin
2558 2018-01-30 19:17:52 I need a night time face oil.
2559 2018-01-30 19:17:39 Basically this regime is doing everything the Big Oil Oligarchs want all are harmful to humans & animals. This is just tip of iceberg of what they’re tearing apart. The Election is looking more like it was actually Rigged to seat Trump. There’s new evidence Russia hacked Voter /3
2560 2018-01-30 19:17:36 I am against skincare because rosehip oil once gave me a rash: my story
2561 2018-01-30 19:17:35 By definition, Canadian Oil is not nationalised therefore it operates within a free market. While that market may have oversite, subsidies, taxes etc that is true of any industry. That does not change the fact that it is still a free market.
2562 2018-01-30 19:17:34 yes but my husband's FRIENDS recommend oil heaters. Sigh. Sure wall panel more economical and suitable, have used in CT
2563 2018-01-30 19:17:27 I may be totally wrong, but I'm thinking same principle as a lighter: I wouldn't put sparking electricity near fuel oil.
2564 2018-01-30 19:17:27 castor oil n aloe 
2565 2018-01-30 19:17:24 Let me tell you about this oxygen and essential oil high...
2566 2018-01-30 19:17:11 In the Skincare War my weapons of choice against the Coconut Oil Army are the oil cleansing method and glycolic acid.
2567 2018-01-30 19:17:08 i wish real and pure argan oil was easier to find, so many out there are not the real thing!
2568 2018-01-30 19:17:04 grown with that delicious oil wastewater
2569 2018-01-30 19:17:01 Oya in pronouncing the status quo, tell me the difference naa cos u sha wan sub 
Anyway it is called Oil not Oyel sha
2570 2018-01-30 19:16:49 Watch out for the canola oil
2571 2018-01-30 19:16:31 alright i completed an oil spill mvm thing without dying as engi, but i still get condescended by some redneck scout
2572 2018-01-30 19:16:12 Two managers at work genuinely tried to argue that oil does not come from dinosaurs; that experience made me really grateful for my education through life thus far.
2573 2018-01-30 19:16:08 I think we can assume the consumption of oil, turpentine and mineral spirits could not have been good for the human body. Wonder what symptoms of toxicity are?
2574 2018-01-30 19:16:05 I was trying different styles and brushes for a long time, until I finally got comfortable with the oil/watery style. Yes please do!!
2575 2018-01-30 19:15:48 Hot take: the kindest, most wholesome food in the world is sweet potato rubbed in olive oil and salt, roasted in the oven (or on the BBQ!) and sprinkled with paprika and butter if you fancy it.
2576 2018-01-30 19:15:44 Mate your gonna tear me to shreds. My team breaks the world record for a CB and benches him . I'd like a little oil to share and buy a keeper/ CB and a striker. Please share.
2577 2018-01-30 19:15:42 My car needs an oil change , & a tire rotation so bad ..

2582 2018-01-30 19:15:15 I remember how gleefully Hillary said “we came, we saw, he died” referring to the assassination of Qaddafi for his gold and his oil.  What happened to all those tons of gold that was taken out of the Libyan Central Bank vaults anyway?  How ANYONE voted for her is disgusting!
2583 2018-01-30 19:14:27 Good luck in oil queue and have a wonderful day ;)

2585 2018-01-30 19:14:18 I've said this from the beginning, looks more true every day: 
Here's what happened:
Trump&Co: "You help me become president, get in White House, forgive our Russian held debt. We'll lift sanctions, open up oil reserves, etc. We'll make billions

Putin&Co: OK...

 #TrumpRussia

2615 2018-01-30 19:10:46 MMS is peddled by a self styled 'church' and the administration as religious rites. However this has nothing to do with the Church and is seems more like an attempt to put their snake oil cures outside of the remit of medicine laws.
2616 2018-01-30 19:10:46 In that case everyone on the planet with a mutual fund or some kind of retirement fund is hurting people passively because they all include stocks in PMC, pharma, big oil, etc. Let's focus on people actively hurting people, that's objectively measurable and not in short supply

2628 2018-01-30 19:09:39 Back to Nixon. Saddam sold oil for euros,Gaddafi was trying to back a pan-African currency w gold. Any threat to petro $ has resulted in US invasion. We are all over Africa.

2648 2018-01-30 19:07:10 I think you misunderstood what I was saying. Let me know if you find someone that distributes illegal movies cause I have not seen an individual in that profession since Bush was looking for oil. I was unaware that it was still being done.
2649 2018-01-30 19:07:03 My face is so dry :( someone help me out. I already exfoliate once a week with a cocounut oil sugar scrub, what else can I use. Literally anything

But he’s working “within a budget”

2651 2018-01-30 19:06:59 and people who have a car but can't be fucked to change the oil? people who have ovens but can't be fucked to cook? this is like the Soylent argument. It's not for every day. It's for sometimes.

Sometimes I can't use products because they contain sunflower oil (this is where personalization would make things better) and I am allergic but this month I can use everything!! Thanks @walmart for my free samples! #walmartbeautybox #brandshareus

2664 2018-01-30 19:05:32 "Oh holy Black Jesus, Petchouli oil!!! That was so cool that the album smelled like that when we bought it!"

This text was to my brother who recently purchased an aroma genie. He said he got home and his loft smelled "like the @Madonna 1989 Like A Prayer album."
2665 2018-01-30 19:05:21 you don't half tweet shite.
Scotland is off and we're remaining in the EU just like we voted, good luck, we'll still send you electricity, oil, water, gas, whisky, fish, computer games and all the other stuff, but you can take your weapons of mass destruction back. #NoThanks

2671 2018-01-30 19:04:59 Have you looked into cbd distillate? I usually pick up a gram or so of some potent stuff and mix it with my reg oil for the terpy flavors and it’s a god send
2672 2018-01-30 19:04:52 Who would like to know how to get a Free Bottle of 500 CBD Oil? 
2673 2018-01-30 19:04:52 Heat probably a good idea... my gran used to suggest warm olive oil on Cotton wool.
2674 2018-01-30 19:04:46 Do not be fooled tonight by the mango puppet snake oil salesman. He wanted a bill of , then killed it. He is not normal. Reading rarely but tonight from a promoter drivel he said he wrote but Miller did dies not make him presidential. Traitor Trump is dangerous to democracy

2678 2018-01-30 19:04:03 I dream of a day when a battery charged by solar/wind can power a shipping tanker transporting batteries that are more energy dense than barrels of oil.

2695 2018-01-30 19:02:05 Its a FASCIST and DANGEROUS world we are entering into, no sanctions for some(buds) but sanctions there( oil I need, fuck you), racism there hatred IS  EVERYWHERE!!. @realDonaldTrump @TYTNetwork @CNN
2696 2018-01-30 19:02:04 The only UN Sanctions against SA were oil and arms. Member countries can impose further sanctions on top of that, they just can't totally embargo (as that is an act of war)
You can always do more, not less, but you can always be forced to defend yourself.
2697 2018-01-30 19:02:01 it is difficult, took me awhile to get the hang of it. umm i think i used airbrush, coarse brush and oil paint

2717 2018-01-30 18:59:57 really good ones--their pm moisturizer is really nice (and good for am or pm) but their am has spf that gets kind of clumpy. hmmmm i also like fresh brand everything and have heard good things about soap and glory and abt neutrogena oil free. are you in seattle forever now?
2718 2018-01-30 18:59:54 I'm thinking about doing an oil painting tonight since I have loads of oil paint and was always afraid to work with it because the last time I attempted in 2015 was a disastre
2719 2018-01-30 18:59:52 How can olive oil be virgin?
2720 2018-01-30 18:59:35 What the total amount of oil left in the Middle East? Slowly and surely decreasing.
2721 2018-01-30 18:59:34 likely hes stepping down to avoid ridiculous controversy considering he has only 5 weeks left to retire. good to see the swell of support around republicans (who seem all sponsored by big banks, big oil, pharma)
2722 2018-01-30 18:59:03 Actually sharks couldn't survive in oil infested waters...so an oil swamp is what's left.
2723 2018-01-30 18:58:59 For real. I got some oil I can sprinkle
2724 2018-01-30 18:58:59 The military industrial complex,the prison industrial complex,the intelligence agencies,the private banking cartels and multinational banks,the pharmaceutical industry,monsanto,the oil industry,I'm sure I missed a few but there's a short list of the industries that run our lives
2725 2018-01-30 18:58:56 Lovely. Watercolour Or oil?
2726 2018-01-30 18:58:54 Do U supposed Trump has put a gun to the heads of the CEO's in charge of drilling and says "Drill or else!"? Do PPL or do PPL not enjoy what they call the benefits of the #combustionengine? #oil #drilling #machines #industrialproduction #cars

2729 2018-01-30 18:58:23 what is your favorite way to use coconut oil?
2730 2018-01-30 18:58:20 The main reason I stopped using coconut oil on my face is because it stinks . . . they I realized, it doesn't moisturize anything.
2731 2018-01-30 18:58:19 an idiot who thinks ICE cars and oil and gas industries get no subsidies ... EV subsidies are a FRACTION of those given to polluting industries
2732 2018-01-30 18:58:16 Not watching the “snake oil salesman” either.
2733 2018-01-30 18:58:05 What?  All you need is a bottle of oil and the priesthood holders can consecrate it right then and there.  Why would a priesthood holder not give a blessing?  Anytime I've asked for one, it's been provided right away.
2734 2018-01-30 18:58:03 I've been using rosehip oil daily and it's helping! I won't pretend that it doesn't take a while to see the results, but my face does look better.
2735 2018-01-30 18:57:57 hi mate to hear the devastating news. I had the same news last year and told I won't see next Christmas. Just something I've been doing is the alchaline diet. you have to very strict with it but it's working wonders for me and if you take that with the oil it is possible turn it.
2736 2018-01-30 18:57:38 Was it PT Barnum who said, there's a sucker born every minute?  "De Base" does like their master showman and snake oil salesman-in-chief!
2737 2018-01-30 18:57:29 gues ill brew some coffee for tonight get the midnight oil going since i just got a call that i have work at 3 in the morning :P

2739 2018-01-30 18:57:13 Used to be mineral oil but now veg oil but doesn't last as long. For any tools not used often bees wax is best. Teak oil on the woodwork
2740 2018-01-30 18:57:06 Watch the new rules around interest deductions though. They should accelerate the shift towards less leverage. Tight oil firms have relied on debt a lot in the past. @RTDukes has been discussing this at length w/ @WoodMackenzie clients.

1) $DRIP - Sold all $11.80s. We were loading in the $9s so big profit on 10% move. $XOP went to target $37. May break down more shortly with $CL_F turning down / $DXY popping
2) $DWT - Sold the ones bought in $10.40s. Still want $13-14
2749 2018-01-30 18:56:14 Canon fact : meme stealer and the oil gang have twitter RP accounts of real people and they're really bad and cringy

2758 2018-01-30 18:55:05 Solar/wind/hydro are neither more expensive or unreliable. They do not destroy the local nor global environment, neither by their extraction nor combustion (like coal/oil/gas to different degrees), which is also quite a big deal.
2759 2018-01-30 18:55:04 Getting me a oil change I be doing to much traveling
2760 2018-01-30 18:54:28 Humpty Trumpty  giv a big speech. Wants an oil rig on everyone's beach. All the oil n all of coal will bring him closer closer to his goal.

2769 2018-01-30 18:53:43 I couldn't be a beauty blogger because 1) I don't know enough about skin types outside of my own and I don't believe in peddling snake oil and 2) my enthusiasm for certain products waxes and wanes w/my bank account.

2785 2018-01-30 18:52:28 Utd are a worldwide fanbase with supporters and sponsorships all over the world. No need for oil here.
2786 2018-01-30 18:52:16 I don't begrudge City at all, and if AFC had that kind of money I would want them to utilize it as City are doing. City fans didn't ask for the oil money did they, you know the old saying you can't choose your parents etc. I love the fact that ManU can't lord it like they used to
2787 2018-01-30 18:52:06 Thought it was the oil cooler return line for a long time
2788 2018-01-30 18:52:03 Modi govt got a huge bounty in terms o steep oil price decline since feb 2015. Saved hugely on forex reserves. Did not pass on benefits to people, instead increased excise hugely.  So, they ought to be sitting on huge reserves with govt, maybe hidden in some form.
2789 2018-01-30 18:51:59 My favorite product in the Coconut Shea collection is the hair oil.  #DiscoverEDEN #haircare #giveaway #winEden
2790 2018-01-30 18:51:57 Indeed...

Perhaps a look at the number of pigeons batted out of the sky to get a few squeezes of rapeseed oil is also required...
2791 2018-01-30 18:51:42 I don't believe the reason they give. They just want to keep the GOP in power and make money for their shareholders. Most of the money will pay for equipment, land etc. A much smaller percentage will pay for and fund jobs. Oil refineries are mostly automated processes.

2795 2018-01-30 18:51:11 Stop hating on coconut oil because it doesnt work for YOU. Dont't try and tell women what works best for THEIR hair, and THEIR skin. I live by (unrefined) coconut oil. I use it for EVERYTHING, and I have no intentions of stopping.

2798 2018-01-30 18:51:00 vitamin E oil is doing WONDERS for my skin
2799 2018-01-30 18:51:00 I think I'm liking the 5 by 2 size, just not sure if that would squash it too much compared to the width. Oil on canvas, or should the paper be something else?
2800 2018-01-30 18:51:00 I had a plug for oil but noooo my sister wanna play games and cut him out her life smh.....
2801 2018-01-30 18:50:51 Don't forget him standing on a ladder drizzling them with copious amounts of olive oil and chucking seasoning on 'from a height'....
2802 2018-01-30 18:50:42 I need to go get a oil change
2803 2018-01-30 18:50:39 I suggest you learn to write proper English and grammer which actually makes sense before following Oil Money FC.

2806 2018-01-30 18:50:19 Free Your Oil And The Rest Shall Follow
2807 2018-01-30 18:50:00 In the ecig shop today.... some guy comes in and asks the ladies.. “excuse me? what does the blueberry oil taste like?” 
2808 2018-01-30 18:49:57 Oh yeah I made the same mistake less is more when it comes to coconut oil lmao
2809 2018-01-30 18:49:56 True it's a massive oversight when put like that and as I understand it when North Sea oil is depleted it's the government that's covering the cost of decommissioning? To me that's a good reason why Indy is a very bad idea at this time.
2810 2018-01-30 18:49:47 @mauriciomacri Buenas tardes este nivel de precios de gas oil impide alcampo producir, sería bueno bajar  la carga impositiva del combustible a la producción agropecuaria y al transporte de prod. primarios, en forma directa o pudiéndo utilizar a cuenta al pago de otros impuestos!
2811 2018-01-30 18:49:43 sometimes when I put lavender oil in my bath I feel like skincare twitter is going to bust down my door and slap a dog cone on me
2812 2018-01-30 18:49:39 As if we need any more proof that the professional xtian racists, homophobes & misogynists are nothing more than grifters and snake oil salespeople. "Values voters" my ass.
2813 2018-01-30 18:49:34 I was just about to give up on the soy oil
2814 2018-01-30 18:49:29 Chelsea offer been accepted, I will be very surprised plays any part tonight.
2815 2018-01-30 18:49:28 ... just announce that you have cancer and see how you are inundated with offers to "help" you with cannabis oil. 
Any idiot can catch any desperate person with the lure of quick curesr.
2816 2018-01-30 18:49:22 Mega geiler Vortrag! Vielen Dank an Prof. Skibicki. Data is the new Oil  @iotatoken tangle der Rückenmark der Industire 4.0 
2817 2018-01-30 18:49:21 About two years ago, Jeff Baitwa tried to push government to create an oil fund to bail out distressed firms hit by the sluggishness in the oil industry. The idea was shot down. Uganda needs an oil fund to support local firms. ThreeWays Shipping should be alive.
2818 2018-01-30 18:49:15 While American ownership groups in Manchester, Liverpool, and London are shit dicking their way to irrelevance, oil barons from the Arabian peninsula are positioning their team to be the Bayern of England. Way to go, America. You’ve ruined soccer in the colonies and the isles!
2819 2018-01-30 18:49:09 It comes as an element of that; to separate it out:

1. Everyone (inc Exxon) is drilling in the Permian
2. Adding 400K/bpd in 7 yrs is notable, not amazing. 
But:
3. They're the latest to tout investments likely to be made anyway.
4. Oil cos want low corp tax to begin with
2820 2018-01-30 18:49:03 also throw chile arbol with its seeds in your Olive oil and let it sit with it. blows mind
2821 2018-01-30 18:49:00 <油botとは永遠のライバルであり、良い友達です
2822 2018-01-30 18:48:56 How is it okay to leave a half empty container of Mobil1 10W-30 motor oil ON THE SIDE OF THE Street??? Like wtf people. It's terrible for the environment. Throw it away, recycle it! USE IT???
2823 2018-01-30 18:48:41 When Jhene Aiko said “ Lead us to salvation , pour that oil please. That’s how we become kings and queens “ I FELT THAT ! 
2824 2018-01-30 18:48:13 @Jstein1202 by the way I told you what the real reason was. Had nothing to do with the Koch’s or pro oil. Like I said we import the panels & assemble here. Now it can all be done here by American workers. More good for Americans
2825 2018-01-30 18:48:11 Murphy Oil Soap in a country club: a true workout.
2826 2018-01-30 18:48:08 Ariul's 7 Days Mask with tea tree oil and the buffering lotion from Mario Badescu have both been amazing, but my big gamechanger has been hydrocolloidal acne patches (Peach and Lily's Acne Spot Dots are one great example)
2827 2018-01-30 18:48:00 Oil is abiotic not from fossils...Russian scientists have proven this with oil found as far down as eight miles below the crust
2828 2018-01-30 18:47:48 สร้างกำแพงไว้สะสูงแล้วจะเรียกร้องหาใครทำไม!?
2829 2018-01-30 18:47:45 Going on about oil...pmsl... Prime land across the world is that back-up... City are the flagship of a new empire for when the oil is gone... Get used to it.
2830 2018-01-30 18:47:39 Does olive oil spoil WutFace
2831 2018-01-30 18:47:30 Pulling up at the oil place and realizing there’s no wait is seriously the best feeling in the world 
2832 2018-01-30 18:47:24 my hair is healthy, soft as fuck and smells amazing bc of this oil she used. i wish i could get my hair done every single week
2833 2018-01-30 18:47:23 What if they can defy gravity with Koch/Mercer, Russian and US oligarch, oil and gas interests, Assange & black hat hackers’ interventions? It looks like Republican caucus is falling one by one (by kompromat) to save their skin, USA  be damned.
2834 2018-01-30 18:47:13 Says a City fan from Jamaica. Why don't you follow cricket instead.  I'm calm about Man Utd generating record £585m+ revenues without having to rely on oil.
2835 2018-01-30 18:47:11 I do the same. Face creams Frankenscence is awesome for face wrinkles couple drops of pure oil in a carrier product like coconut or johoba carries the Frankenscence into skin
2836 2018-01-30 18:47:09 Folatil Oil Dlm Jahe Sudah Sejak Dulu Tbukti Bisa Mngatasi Problem Penyumbatan Hidung Dan Sesak Nafas
2837 2018-01-30 18:47:09 Yes Kates just had her licence Squashed.
2838 2018-01-30 18:47:07 So now, Pruitt works for him. And Pruitt loves dismantling the EPA for his big oil buddies
2839 2018-01-30 18:46:44 See Trump wants in with Putin because Trump thinks Putin has gas/oil. That way when Trump is through Screwing the USA then he can go to Putin and say look what I did for you!
2840 2018-01-30 18:46:44 Yeah when sharing this tweet I was mostly thinking of cases on the level of the time a Facebook mom tried to tell me Thieves oil is as effective as a flu shot lol
2841 2018-01-30 18:46:43 “Can I use cream-cheese as a substitute for oil” 
HOW IS THIS BLOKE STILL ALIVE?!?
2842 2018-01-30 18:46:34 leo keeps screaming every time he touches oil... isn't he a mechanic?
2843 2018-01-30 18:46:27 Again, Superman has had years or did you forget all the places he traveled to to try and see if he could do something (like that Oil Rig for example). It wasn't the first day on the job. Zod was more inexperienced with the world and atmosphere of the planet.
2844 2018-01-30 18:46:21 Castor oil
2845 2018-01-30 18:46:14 Please explain how what you said is relevant to my post, I don't follow.
In industry, there are policies. What happens to staff who scoff at or ignore policies required by Canadian law.
Examples: workplace safety rules in oil and gas or sawmills or accounting rules in business
2846 2018-01-30 18:45:59 How is the USD, oil, and the Dow down, and gold is also down?
2847 2018-01-30 18:45:48 Scooping poop smells better than watching this snake oil salesman.
2848 2018-01-30 18:45:46 Were JD Rockefeller still with us he would reconstitute Standard Oil and tell government "Make my day" based upon govt looking other way for Bezos and Amazon and others
2849 2018-01-30 18:45:37 @LCFC charge the oil merchants minimum 80 mil for rm
2850 2018-01-30 18:45:20 Retinol is a form of Vitamin A and hailed as key to anti-aging skin care lines. It can be found in grapeseed oil, but be careful to add extra sun protection if you choose to use retinol products during the day!
2851 2018-01-30 18:45:05 Look I'm not interested where he's from ok
2852 2018-01-30 18:44:57 So what are you going to do.  He ignores Congress he ignores the Russians giving North Korea oil he ignores election fraud he has no regard for government
2853 2018-01-30 18:44:43 If you could. Here was me thinking it would be all oil and gas but instead I'm "learning" loads about rugby
2854 2018-01-30 18:44:36 After watching Canada shoot themselves in both feet now they will try shooting themselves in the head. The only oil rich country bordering two oceans that can't get there oil to world markets . Time to short all Canadian oil stocks.
2855 2018-01-30 18:44:35 SIU smells like bowling oil times a thousand. 
2856 2018-01-30 18:44:22 Really need to do an oil treatment on my hair to help it grow but I really don’t feel like having oily gross hair for a couple of days 
2857 2018-01-30 18:44:04 Pregnant people and Mamas:

I have a really itchy lower bump (I’ve been using oil and moisturiser) I’ve also got bad acid reflux and now I’m worried about ICP. 

Am I stressing over nothing, should I get it checked out ASAP or can it wait until my midwife appt on Friday 
2858 2018-01-30 18:43:44 Nice lol
2859 2018-01-30 18:43:33 i use jojoba and vitamin e oil , im not putting coconut oil on my face
2860 2018-01-30 18:43:24 *Girl whose clearly softened her face using Facetune posts a picture*

Y’all: drop the skin care routine sis!

Her: mix coconut oil, toothpaste, chicken grease, dove body wash, Carmex and honey for a thick consistency

Y’all: Yasss thank you queen I gotta hit up walmart tonight
2861 2018-01-30 18:43:11 Saudi Arabia nuclear power deal. Uranium from Utah. Oil from the Artic. Etc. Etc.Etc...
2862 2018-01-30 18:43:04 The client for my advertising campaigns class is in the oil industry & gave us a 50 million dollar budget.... no I'm not stressed :)))
2863 2018-01-30 18:43:01 There’s just enough, a glimmer, of truth which is more than enough for all the snake oil and placebos to rest upon
2864 2018-01-30 18:42:56 so youre saying i should go with three spritzs? im also worried about becoming one of those dudes who over colognes since i have no way to tell with my nose.

i, uh, dont really moisturize consistently? i mean my shower products are all oil based and i do it after i shower.
2865 2018-01-30 18:42:54 @bflay Please consider reviewing studies of canola oil effect on brain/memory. Your recipes are equally awesome using olive or virgin coconut oils! Big Flay Fan!
2866 2018-01-30 18:42:50 Bueno, por lo menos hay una mea culpa respecto "a la rebaja del precio del Gas Oil y se considera q es una medida importante que puede ten. Todo lo que contribuya a aliviar la situación de muchos productores es bienvenida".
2867 2018-01-30 18:42:48 These muthafuckas have one muthafuckin college boy who "coordinates" shit, some fool who is a fuckin "Porter" and then some fuckin vato who actually changes the fuckin oil
2868 2018-01-30 18:42:46 Totally ruined football with your dirty oil  money...
2869 2018-01-30 18:42:36 imagine the oil tweets when mahrez signs for us loooool
2870 2018-01-30 18:42:24 Are you sure? Because last year a corporation literally attacked native Americans who didn't want an oil pipeline on their land because it might burst and spill. It did burst and spill oil. Corporations decide whether you get medical treatment or not.
2871 2018-01-30 18:42:23 I don't know. I take trmadol, which barely does anything really. My brother, in the UK, swears by THC oil for pain, not CBD. But of course he has to get it illegally through a dealer, which is a whole other type of pain!
2872 2018-01-30 18:42:00 Getta job in the oil industry son
2873 2018-01-30 18:41:45 You are worthy worthy worthy Lord, praise like Oil
2874 2018-01-30 18:41:39 Does anyone know if this is an area w/ oil/gas potential?
2875 2018-01-30 18:41:32 Gov. LePage on @mainecalling says another reason to support oil drilling in the Gulf of Maine: "You cannot heat Maine homes with wind and solar in the winter.  It's intermittent."

2877 2018-01-30 18:41:27 @Total reports 1st #oil at #Alberta's Fort Hills project > production will ramp up over the next months to reach a plateau of 180,000 bpd.
2878 2018-01-30 18:41:27 Coconut oil is great for my hair sometimes but i never use it on my face
2879 2018-01-30 18:40:58 Gonna make myself a nice dinner and read a good book. I'll listen to good music. I'll water my plants, change my oil, separate bird seed by kind. Then I'll wash my hair, count the revolutions my ceiling fan makes, start knitting something, remember I don't know how to knit, learn
2880 2018-01-30 18:40:55 If you wanna go with something simple, I’d do natural stuff. Coconut oil for moisturizer, apple cider vinegar for toner. And then neutrogena sells a bar of soap that’s very mild (and cheap).
2881 2018-01-30 18:40:40 Why are you using vegetable oil on Jollof? WHY DO YOU NEED CHICKEN STRIPS IN YOUR  JOLLOF?? JOLLOF SHOULD BE THE WHOLE MEAL MEAT SHOULD BE THE ICING ON THE PROVERBIAL  CAKE.

Ayem sure the video maker knows her jollof is inadequate that's why she added the chicken
2882 2018-01-30 18:40:34 It was  Mustard oil that used a wrench to break the bottle of perfume

2885 2018-01-30 18:40:08 君を笑わせるためなら、僕は尻から油を出すよ。
2886 2018-01-30 18:40:04 I shall also stay away from oil pumps as well.
2887 2018-01-30 18:40:00 Aside from using coconut oil in my food I’ve also discovered the joys of using it on my hair and skin, it actually works :’)
2888 2018-01-30 18:39:54 How do we pay other countries for their oil?
2889 2018-01-30 18:39:54 I can be as crude or refined as I want
Get out of my wheelhouse

Oil Tycoon Speak
2890 2018-01-30 18:39:52 Ian even mad I think I just touched oil.
2891 2018-01-30 18:39:51 Only oil marketers, what about high profile politicians? Or non deserve to be in jail? 3 years gone & we are still waiting for that.
2892 2018-01-30 18:39:29 Praise like oil
For You I pour it out
For You I pour it out
I pour, I pour it out
For You.
2893 2018-01-30 18:39:26 Like a true Greek, for my birthday I asked my dad to ship me 50 pounds of Cretan olive oil from his village. Liquid gold
2894 2018-01-30 18:39:25 United fans "is it your money"

City fans "Is it your oil"


2895 2018-01-30 18:39:16 Recipe if #friendly: Chop Fresh strawberries and cream. Add Pumpkin Pie & Amontillado. Put in oil heater for 30 mins. Bon appétit! #hangry
2896 2018-01-30 18:39:16 You'll buy the whole olive oil popcorn! but you'll only need the EDGE!
2897 2018-01-30 18:38:56 I'd love to see the oil men pull the plug on the lot!
2898 2018-01-30 18:38:56 seems anomalous, with U.S. oil production 2nd peak approaching, that the crude inventories ("stocks") have dropped by 15% year-over-year, doesn't it, #peakoil'ers?  Are we exporting that much?
2899 2018-01-30 18:38:52 Unlikely to be M25 as it was started in early 70's long before Thatcher was in power. Would have been rather insulting to scots to use north sea oil money to build roads in South East 
2900 2018-01-30 18:38:40 "Three on a Match" has a shot of a pillow with Macassar oil stains to show that an unmarried couple hooked up. Pretty clever!
2901 2018-01-30 18:38:32 Canada also signed, yet recently approved a huge oil pipeline project... We need to walk the walk...
2902 2018-01-30 18:38:29 La bi oil, mais faut vrmt pas en avoir marre d’en mettre genre 2/3fois par jour en petite dose, mais qd tu te maquille c relou vu que c une huile
2903 2018-01-30 18:38:25 Neither do emails carrying classified info belong on a private unsecured server so a SecOfState and her President can talk about the Grandkids and .. oh.. Iran, Turkey, oil, .. uranium.. etc, etc.
2904 2018-01-30 18:38:22 @OWMarshall   Gathered that but still come on City = Arabs, Money, Oil. Not we cant afford wages, transfer fees to high especially coming from manager who picks which players to buy, I mean either admit that your CITY or stop spending. what do you actually make of peps comment
2905 2018-01-30 18:38:12 Beard oil is what you need!
2906 2018-01-30 18:38:00 Oil of Olaf.
2907 2018-01-30 18:37:57 Notice his hat.  Virtue signaling tub of soybean oil.

Soy Fanatic?
Socialism Fan?
So Fat?
2908 2018-01-30 18:37:33 Page never met with the Russian, Igor, they claimed he did and they knew it before the 2nd FISA extension. Page met with hundreds of fellow oil and gas consultants in a known trip to Russia.
2909 2018-01-30 18:37:14 'The current oil based energy system is also another system that will be replaced by a better system.'~still waiting in 2018
2910 2018-01-30 18:37:08 And regarding my age, I've been a United supporter since I was 5, so much likely a lot longer than you've been a City supporter considering when the oil money came in. 2/2
2911 2018-01-30 18:36:48 Anything by Drunk Elephant, esp the vitamin c oil! I just see people saying ‘believe the hype’ and i need some vitamin c in my life

2914 2018-01-30 18:36:33 I’m up here getting my oil changed and this white lady done told me her whole life story in 10 mins
2915 2018-01-30 18:36:29 Some day my child will eat sauce *sighs wistfully* She'll eat the spouts, but salt and olive oil only.
2916 2018-01-30 18:36:14 Although if he solved that problem and put Auzzie Blokes back on them, it would be a great idea. We had it working well in the late seventies and eighties, my grandfather worked on the oil tankers prior to the pipe to SA, and my whole family are Seafairers, I can see it working
2917 2018-01-30 18:36:08 YOU ARE ACCOMPLICES TO TRUMP'S OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE ANTICS, HIS COZINESS WITH RUSSIA. WHY ARE THERE RUSSIAN OIL TANKERS OUTSIDE BOSTON RIGHT NOW?
2918 2018-01-30 18:36:07 Seriously?!! I feel not an ounce of compassion for any of them at Carrier who believed this snake oil salesman, every business he’s touched has gone belly up, he’s a liar, adulterer, ignorant close minded man child in other words a straight up con man. Your own fault,not sorry!
2919 2018-01-30 18:36:06 1) Coconut Oil also clogs my goddamn drains, because it is a SOLID AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. 
2)
3) Is it gauche to hope for such an outcome?
2920 2018-01-30 18:36:02 This isn't shocking coming from the snake oil salesman aka Tom Brady who was pushing $15 bottles of water he claimed would stop you from getting sun burnt.
2921 2018-01-30 18:36:00 يا رب
2922 2018-01-30 18:36:00 my pliers are more for the bottles of linseed oil that I use too little and the tops get stuck....
2923 2018-01-30 18:35:33 Not sure how reporters knew but Liberal govt. officials didn't know from whom they were getting the oil from?
I haven't seen anything that says Trump admin has blocked those lines of inquiry.
2924 2018-01-30 18:35:29 1. Heat olive oil and add curry powder.
2. Add onion + ginger (extra, this is the magic ingredient)
3. Add Black beans + grated carrot. 
4. Cook for 5 minutes 
5. Enjoy the deliciousness

You're welcome.  #yummyinmytummy

2928 2018-01-30 18:34:33 What a joke! £30m for Sanchez, ridiculous! £60m for Mayrez, good business. Fucking oil money
2929 2018-01-30 18:34:25 So oil using ships and aircraft are insignificant?

2935 2018-01-30 18:33:40 Death threats are increasing. Time to oil up the second amendment.
2936 2018-01-30 18:33:30 Is there an essential oil to hear better?
2937 2018-01-30 18:33:19 Phil from next door: Do you have a date for valentines? 
Me: Yeah February 14th, now fuck off you ugly cunt. 
Also me: jokes Phillip, now come round when it’s dark, don’t tell anyone and bring the baby oil. 

I’m a slave to this DNA dumpster of a vag 
2938 2018-01-30 18:33:18 finally getting an oil change
2939 2018-01-30 18:33:16 i can always feel the oil popping up on my nose. shit crazy.
2940 2018-01-30 18:32:59 tea tree oil solves all problems
2941 2018-01-30 18:32:54 Will be your problem when the oil runs out and they still have not built any great history like Man Utd.
2942 2018-01-30 18:32:52 FT gonna go into a meltdown..
Oil money tweets everywhere.What a time to be a City fan!!!
2943 2018-01-30 18:32:48 Babes don’t put coconut oil on your hair, if it’s dyed because natural oils dissolve the hair dye 
2944 2018-01-30 18:32:47 Dope af
2945 2018-01-30 18:32:44 Oil Rogue = favorite deck to play when I'm feeling Wild.
2946 2018-01-30 18:32:40 Buenas tardes este nivel de precios de gas oil impide alcampo producir,  creo sería bueno buscar bajar la carga impositiva a la producción agropecuaria y al transporte de productos primarios, podría ser en forma directa o pudiéndolo utilizar para pago de otros impuestos!!Gracias
2947 2018-01-30 18:32:36 i’m just trying to dry a very thick oil painting in under 20 minutes
2948 2018-01-30 18:32:35 My favs: Wall Cost Reductions and Oil Cost Reductions?
2949 2018-01-30 18:32:17 @WholeFoods Why do you still cook with canola oil in your market places and product line when we can safely conclude that it is an inflammatory and there are healthier oil alternatives? (e.g. coconut, avocado, etc.)
2950 2018-01-30 18:32:04 It’s too thick of an oil though, if you use a tiny bit with another moisturizer jts fine but to use it by itself all over the face blocks the pores.
2951 2018-01-30 18:31:53 I'd love to see Yellowstone before the EPA lets them drill for oil.
2952 2018-01-30 18:31:41 Right @HouseGOP @GOP @SenateGOP didn’t do nothing good with bush or Obama they afraid to death of trump I wonder why that is ??? Republicans didn’t care about gun control or the environment y’all hands in oil an selling drugs to the market I expose y’all @BBCWorld it true .
2953 2018-01-30 18:31:30 Do people know the truth about the oil money being used for conversions. Why don't you agree that with the growth of Islam grew the fundamentalist Islamic groups spreading their wings of terror. All religion preaches peace but Islam piece. Make a punchline
2954 2018-01-30 18:31:29 Will some of that be at the expense of New England’s multi generational fishing communities? How many oil spills will end Maine lobsters?
2955 2018-01-30 18:31:22 city worst club ever.
oil money club.
2956 2018-01-30 18:31:17 @BakhtawarBZ cleaners & guards at szabist are deprived of their basic labor rights - contracted to avoid benefits; many below min wage.
2957 2018-01-30 18:31:15 If only mine would last that long - Jason and the Argon Oil lasted less than 30 washes for me before it broke into pieces too small to use on thick long hair. I gave the pieces to Mum to use up, but it still didn't last anywhere near 80 washes.
2958 2018-01-30 18:31:02 you ever like.....realise you have absolutely no skills whatsoever.....but your face is smooth from coconut oil so it's all good for at least an hour
2959 2018-01-30 18:30:56 Can’t worry and have faith. That’s like mixing oil into water
2960 2018-01-30 18:30:54 Can someone tell me what’s wrong about using coconut oil on your face (im too lazy to look it up)
2961 2018-01-30 18:30:53 As I stated previously. I literally don't care what you choose to believe. It makes no difference to me if some random guy on Twitter doesn't believe that I produce precision engineered components exclusively for the oil and gas sector. I could say Google is your best pal also 
2962 2018-01-30 18:30:53 OIL DIFF: 4.39 -> 4.39
2963 2018-01-30 18:30:46 Blend 9 oz bacon with 2 quarts chicken. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Slice into 1 inch pieces. Serve on bread
2964 2018-01-30 18:30:42 I lost a box of condone and sex oil in my moms house...
2965 2018-01-30 18:30:36 People who use coconut oil on their face are suspect
2966 2018-01-30 18:30:30 We are aware it won't work again. Govt is focusing on anything that can generate money without investing. Like selling crude oil
2967 2018-01-30 18:30:28 The Media only reports the mighty US and its worldwide political/oil involvement. So a majority of peoples knowledge of previous dignitaries with views, involvement or practices ; which most would find shocking. Vastly go reported or selectively ignored by our UK media.
2968 2018-01-30 18:30:21 Not 5410 reels but I just rebuilt some 3150 reels. Very tight once back together. I put a bit of engine oil on the seals and also loosened the side plates and hit the shaft back and forth. Then retighten. Loosened up quite a bit. Hoping they loosen a bit more once they get used.
2969 2018-01-30 18:30:19 Alaskans own 402,642 shares of SOCO INTERNATIONAL PLC, worth $682,220. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in UNITED KINGDOM.
2970 2018-01-30 18:30:12 What do you have against oil money?
2971 2018-01-30 18:30:10 Neither the left nor the right can meme. A meme by definition is an inside joke or self aware witticism that has universal appeal. Mixing memes with partisan politics is like mixing oil and water.
2972 2018-01-30 18:30:04 OIL DIFF: 4.37 -> 4.42
2973 2018-01-30 18:29:40 Nope, no breakouts, and I've been using it for a month now. But then again while my skin is relatively "normal," it has a tendency to go dry than oily. I'm using Simple Hydrating Cleansing Oil.
2974 2018-01-30 18:29:12 Man sheiky 2008- when oil prices drop 
2975 2018-01-30 18:28:59 When I was in Oil & Gas it was like waiting for the Grim Reaper. 400 lives undone.
2976 2018-01-30 18:28:40 Just heard that a dietician came to visit my Grandad. She said he needed to start eating brown bread and olive oil spread.

He turned round and said "you can shove your olive oil up your arse! Where are my trifles?!"
2977 2018-01-30 18:28:26 @marcorubio will be selling snake oil soon from under a tent set up in the clearings outside of small southern towns. Traveling salvation show. F’ing crook.
2978 2018-01-30 18:28:24 37 weeks today! I’m at the gym trying to walk this baby out and I started primrose oil today! Wish me luck this baby will be here so soon you guys! 
2979 2018-01-30 18:28:21 @achrisevans are you losing your hair?  I read an article that said if we still have hair on our head there’s potential for regrowth.  I use shampoo with caffeine (it blocks DHT) and Argan oil.  Hope this helps.
2980 2018-01-30 18:28:19 Itu la pasal so idk apa lagi oil cleanser yang kat drugstore but I think should be fine takda breakout sebab dia macam makeup remover
2981 2018-01-30 18:28:10 Cuando el Rockefeller Center se empezó a construir, en Buenos Aires el edificio Kavanahg ya existía.

Cuando la Standart Oil empezó a construir su primer kilómetro de oleoducto, YPF Argentina tenía 35 Km de oleoductos y 95 pozos para explorar.
2982 2018-01-30 18:28:10 There’s tea tree oil in my mouth
2983 2018-01-30 18:27:58 TUESDAY MORNING, ER, AFTERNOON, IN ENERGY - Oil having a bit of a day here – getting tagged a bit as people start to worry a little re: production #OOTT
2984 2018-01-30 18:27:44 yes, i love mine. i put peppermint essential oil in it which is probably not actually recommended but it's nice
2985 2018-01-30 18:27:44 I love vitamin E oil! I use it everyday and I also put it under my primer when I do my makeup. I really want to try it as primer though.
2986 2018-01-30 18:27:39 Does anyone have experience or recommendations for CBD oil? We want to put my dad on it, but I have no idea what I'm doing
2987 2018-01-30 18:27:33 What Oil Crisis you referring to?
2988 2018-01-30 18:27:30 
2989 2018-01-30 18:27:22 @DeanHeller
Dean Heller is a coward
Sanctions on Russian oligarchs, banks and oil companies were imposed on a veto proof majority last year
These sanctions were for espionage and campaign interference
They were supposed to be enforced in Oct the extension expires today
Enforce
2990 2018-01-30 18:27:20 People need to get on that marula oil
2991 2018-01-30 18:26:47 Getting my oil changed and I'm on a 34% battery and I forgot my charger noooooooooooo
2992 2018-01-30 18:26:32 เฮ้ออ ไม่ค่อยได้มาตามลูกเลย งานเยอะเว้ออ #IdolProducer
2993 2018-01-30 18:26:32 The new oil for this pen burns too fast, going back to whatever the last one way & the tip is prettier
2994 2018-01-30 18:26:29 There's been a lot of unrest in Shea Butter/Skincare Twitter on the use of coconut oil. The ppl are divided..
2995 2018-01-30 18:26:27 Yep. All because U loosened regulations that will allow them to drill in some of our most fragile ecosystems. Once they have exploited & destroyed areas we value, they will shut down & move on...hell what a few more fracking issues and oil spills to help out your buddies, right?
2996 2018-01-30 18:26:15 (In my most pathetic tones) can someone bring me some olbas oil?
2997 2018-01-30 18:26:13 Ground flax seed in your food (I put it in my oatmeal) works really great as an Omega 3 source with less of the problems of fish oil. It is even practical on cost.
2998 2018-01-30 18:26:11 @theJeremyVine are you losing your hair?  I read an article that said if we still have hair on our head there’s potential for regrowth.  I use shampoo with caffeine and Argan oil.  Hope this helps.
2999 2018-01-30 18:26:10 I am never coming to Walmart for an oil change again. It does not take 2+ hours
3000 2018-01-30 18:26:06 Sooo.... I have my girls car today cause I told her I’d wash it for her & get her oil change done. When I pick her up from work I’m pulling up with some roses...  just because.
3001 2018-01-30 18:25:56 My skin is doing some mild peeling from that light chemical peel facial I got Sunday & I just put some sweet almond oil on my face than applied my make up& it looks good.
3002 2018-01-30 18:25:56 And of course the long "sufferings" of elderly/infirm who cannot afford to pay for accessing the basic human right of affordable/reliable power;energy poverty is my pet aversion in life;policymakers who deny these people this,should be boiled in oil.
3003 2018-01-30 18:25:52 I'm like that with extra virgin olive oil. 

Vinegar is for pie and mash liqor only tbh.
3004 2018-01-30 18:25:47 The only skincare things I really swear by (because I get what they do, and can feel the difference) are:

benzoyl peroxide foaming cleanser
Clarisonic Mia
CeraVe
and, vitamin E oil
3005 2018-01-30 18:25:41 It’s an oil. Heavy heavy moisturizer and clogs tf outta your pores. Especially if you got acne prone skin the shit ain’t good for the face.
3006 2018-01-30 18:25:37 Surprisingly you're not the first person who's offered oil today.
3007 2018-01-30 18:25:34 Between the carving up of the ottoman empire and the plundering of oil ever since you got a hard case ahead of you to prove your still owed
3008 2018-01-30 18:25:33 hi sis sorry nk tanya. U apply cane tea tree oil tu? Directly onto your face ke? After moisturize or? Hehehe tqqq
3009 2018-01-30 18:25:31 The push for people to divest from oil and coal is running in parallel though and is slowly gaining momentum
3010 2018-01-30 18:25:30 As previously; Welcome to Pre-2003. Before oil money bought your trophies...
3011 2018-01-30 18:25:24 #7DG

Like wine for you to drink

3012 2018-01-30 18:25:24 Norway does have a lot going for it because of capitalism. They are able to provide healthcare for their citizens but compare the population of Norway to the US! Their oil industry is huge and they used it to grow unlike the US. There’s a lot more to it than your simple analogy.
3013 2018-01-30 18:25:22 I’m starving waiting on my car to finish getting a oil change

3015 2018-01-30 18:25:19 I am loving The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, but would have never found the oil lamp without a guide. The default brightness made the hallway it was down essentially invisible.
3016 2018-01-30 18:25:14 I wonder if they're going to take the dirt roads, can't be "fossil free" using asphalt paved roads made from oil.

3024 2018-01-30 18:24:38 The Trump agenda for the EPA:
1. Oil drilling platforms in Yellowstone National Park
2. Natural gas drilling platforms in Death Valley National Park
3. Polluted Colorado River running through the Grand Canyon.

"America the Beautiful" is doomed!
3025 2018-01-30 18:24:26 I started oil pulling today!  let’s see how it goes. 
3026 2018-01-30 18:24:26 @info -  Palm oil exports hit record high of $23 billion last year
3027 2018-01-30 18:24:20 I don't want oil money from a backward state bankrolling our ambitions thanks. City spending billions on players isn't "showing real ambition".
3028 2018-01-30 18:24:15 hey guys epic hemp oil enthusiast here letting you know cbd oil is good and actually works.
3029 2018-01-30 18:23:56 i washed my makeup brushes yesterday and i tried to use olive oil and soap like every beauty blog in earth says to do but APPARENTLY i put too much olive oil in so my brushes are covered in oil
3030 2018-01-30 18:23:52 The mantle falls the oil flows when the motive and heart is right.
3031 2018-01-30 18:23:51 "Experts" not so long ago told us oil would go up to $200 per barrel, some even said $250. It got to about $147 then plummeted. Those same experts then said oil would drop to $20, one even said $8. It fell to about $40 then started going back up.
3032 2018-01-30 18:23:50 solidarity with all fries, we all fry in the same hot oil
3033 2018-01-30 18:23:48 Oil money.
3034 2018-01-30 18:23:40 Yeah. I’m on board. Basically the theory is the body either burns fat or sugar. Healthy fat (eg, coconut oil) satiates you so your not hungry all the time. Also, refined coconut oil, aka MCT oil (BulletProof is a brand) is proven great for mitochondrial health
3035 2018-01-30 18:23:36 i want a face oil fashioned of grudges placated in the afterlife
3036 2018-01-30 18:23:35 Thank god I know how to change my oil... my dad does it for me but I know how lol
3037 2018-01-30 18:23:30 Tell me where I'm wrong, Jill? Do we NOT get our GERS figures from the London Treasury? Is every National company's head office (oil, whisky, banking, etc) NOT in London? Is our entire Propaganda machine NOT in London?
3038 2018-01-30 18:23:21 No OIL painting.
3039 2018-01-30 18:23:13 LADIES. 
Give me hair tips. What kind of sprays/masks/whatever else is good to put in ur hair to keep it shiny and healthy (with less frizz/oil in my case) ???
3040 2018-01-30 18:23:01 Two possibilities not mutually exclusive: 1. Not imposing sanctions = the quo for Putin’s quid: handing you the election, intimately involving your team; 2. Drilling for Arctic oil owned by, basically, Putin. Oh and 3. Assuring that Putin will not release the pee-pee tape.
3041 2018-01-30 18:23:01 Best brown paper and paraffin oil would work too.
3042 2018-01-30 18:23:00 Charity work??! Lol. You buy him because you're rich and loan him to another club. Oil money 
3043 2018-01-30 18:22:53 Yeah I get it and also to prevent Putin from invading smaller vulnerable countries that have access to oil.
3044 2018-01-30 18:22:49 That cabin filter was pretty  freaking gross..the other  filter he said i could go another oil change until replacing. And i did need new wipers. Im not gone sweat it too bad cause the last few oil changes ive paid for just the oil change...ill just eat ham sammiches til payday
3045 2018-01-30 18:22:45 Andy please start implementing a diet high in excellent quality extra virgin olive oil and 100% cocoa its what the oldest woman to live did we need Andy Milonakis to protect earth please stay healthy and happy we lub U

3047 2018-01-30 18:22:39 Why r u such a man hater. What happened for u to be like this. I can see u r no oil painting but who is? Pipe it down and cook us some dinner, even better, get your bitch husband to cook for us. We could give him a bone for his back
3048 2018-01-30 18:22:38 I use a Bobbi Brown cleansing oil once a day at night. Use face wipes if I need to remove make up at other times. X
3049 2018-01-30 18:22:34 Why is Venezuela any of the US concern... Oh right...the oil.
3050 2018-01-30 18:22:28 Hope your children learn to breathe oil - dooming this planet for $$$ #suckabeesarah
3051 2018-01-30 18:22:18 I've been meaning to get an oil change for a solid 4 weeks
3052 2018-01-30 18:22:16 And in order to complete them they need to be made ready for a production platform to come in and start pumping oil by drilling and plugging with cement. Don't see what the big deal is. I did not claim anywhere to work offshore on the rigs themselves.
3053 2018-01-30 18:22:13 We will never beat that Co-op olive oil one from last year
3054 2018-01-30 18:22:04 It pains me to admit to myself that Roger the Cabin Boy cannot catch a fish. He doesn’t even oil his glove anymore.
3055 2018-01-30 18:22:01 STOP PUTTING COCONUT OIL ON YOUR FACE
3056 2018-01-30 18:21:59 If I make a bigger 3 lb batch I add some olive oil to the tomato sauce base and some oregano ( if Italian) or Grape jam for the savages :)
3057 2018-01-30 18:21:59 Why is that bad news for Kenney, or for that matter anyone in Alberta?
Oil will continue to power the world for decades. Worldwide, the industry needs to bring on 5 mbpd of new production every year just to cover depletion. That oil will find buyers.
3058 2018-01-30 18:21:40 Its commission based and the guy gets nothing for a free oil change. Stand your ground and tell him you'll give him a good tip so he doesn't piss in your oil pan.
3059 2018-01-30 18:21:34 coconut oil!!!!
3060 2018-01-30 18:21:28 Put it this way, if the oil dries up tomorrow Man City go back to competing with West Ham and Watford for 10th place. Whereas united will continue to be a powerhouse. Fact!
3061 2018-01-30 18:20:49 on @mainecalling Gov. LePage said he has no choice but to support oil drilling in the Gulf of Maine.  Says too many Mainers were left in the cold because of supply issues this winter. "We don't have oil in the ground here so we have to find our fuels where we can get 'em"
3062 2018-01-30 18:20:47 You've obviously never seen blayzs in person lol he will not drive it in the rain, there is not a drop of grease, oil, or anything in the engine bay he polishes his axles drivelines and everything
3063 2018-01-30 18:20:38 Life hack. Shave with baby oil 
3064 2018-01-30 18:20:37 That's so cool from the UAE , that should pad crude oil prices going forward ...lovely!
3065 2018-01-30 18:20:34 In 2018 we’re gonna stop telling people to add coconut oil as a moisturizer to their skincare routine
3066 2018-01-30 18:20:29 Sharks circling one shark in an oil spill?  I don’t get the full message but I like your art.  Is there any hope for us?
3067 2018-01-30 18:20:26 Per Donnie Jr. a large portion of Trumps money was given to them by Putin in Rubles. Putin put Trump in WH.  Trump owes Putin, which is why Russian oil Tankers are in US Ports & Russian fighters are flagrantly taunting US planes with no repercussions. #PutinsUSA #PutinsPenisPony
3068 2018-01-30 18:20:15 Valvoline instant oil change party!

3070 2018-01-30 18:19:42 Briana talked me into going to get my oil change today 
3071 2018-01-30 18:19:40 30 years ago, God told me that water would be the investment of the  future. Then later, that there would come a day when water would be  traded equally with oil.
3072 2018-01-30 18:19:37 Excellent price and speedy delivery of my Golf R32 Castrol Edge oil. Thanks! @opieoils
3073 2018-01-30 18:19:30 Oil delivered today.. last fill up this winter 
3074 2018-01-30 18:19:29 Eastern Shipyards is trying to scam millions from the oil spill funds on top of huge govt. contract. Ironic, since they intentionally caused more wetland destruction here than the oil spill.
3075 2018-01-30 18:19:16 Walmart auto-center service:
20% changing your oil

3076 2018-01-30 18:19:13 Got a software update for my transmission done alongside the oil change and tire rotation and the car drives way smoother now it’s crazy #2018 #Jeep #Trailhawk
3077 2018-01-30 18:19:11 oh!イル
3078 2018-01-30 18:18:54 well on this point I might agree, they gave TRUMP 24/7 coverage, loving his sound-bytes for their ratings/clicks instead of giving ALL candidates equal coverage which really should be mandatory but they focused on Trump the snake oil salesman
3079 2018-01-30 18:18:45 So fabulous gorgeous Bunny you are like happy sunshine  hugs!! Xoxo thanks for you Amazing. Say I wound what you smell like I'm going too say like  blueberries and rose oil. Yes I know I'm that is so weird hopefully that's good weird. Okay 
3080 2018-01-30 18:18:25 I would enjoy watching the bumpkins and hucksters and oil company lickspits that is the AK State Government run a country.
3081 2018-01-30 18:18:23 Great.  . If they can exchange their oil for our medicine and pharma products it will be really great. HE Minister Vielma Mora should consider participating in the Partnership Summit 2018 during his February visit to India.
3082 2018-01-30 18:18:15 Hahahahaha!! They money you are spending is not from the club it’s dirty Arab oil money! Don’t you know your own club!
3083 2018-01-30 18:18:15 There will soon be convergence of battery technology, electric-autonomous vehicles, and apps that will make oil collapse.

3085 2018-01-30 18:18:12 Off work early bout to get a oil change
3086 2018-01-30 18:18:08 Oil cleansing with rose hip and almond oil really has my skin on God level. I went out on Saturday without a LICK of makeup and felt like everything.
3087 2018-01-30 18:18:05 I needed a new filter and wipers im trying not to complain cause i havent had an oil change that i had to shell out a ton of money for in a while...
3088 2018-01-30 18:18:02 And what are you giving away to the oil companies now?
3089 2018-01-30 18:18:02 I would like to know when the Oklahoma oil company that suffered the tragic rig accident is investigated for changes in safety rules passed by the EPA @ScottPruittOK. He is turning our country into a disaster waiting to happen.
3090 2018-01-30 18:17:59 Me and a licensed veterinarian: "your cat has dry skin, ever tried fish oil capsules?"

Owner: "yes I give her olive oil every morning in her breakfast"

okay, first....no.
3091 2018-01-30 18:17:52 No talk of that oil spill though huh red star.
3092 2018-01-30 18:17:50 The only winners of blocking our pipelines are other oil producing countries. We must look at the big picture and make our country competitive again.
3093 2018-01-30 18:17:50 Won't happen until the oil money dries up!
3094 2018-01-30 18:17:47 Oil pulling is great but for even more fabulous results in dental health try "pulling" with 1/4 tsp organic wheatgrass juice powder in 1oz. Water.
3095 2018-01-30 18:17:47 They had mini pans and mini olive oil, I couldn’t take my eyes off of it

3097 2018-01-30 18:17:45 THE COCONUT OIL SLANDER HAS TO STOP. Y'all problem is that y'all tryna use that shit for everything and not incorporating other oils and butters into y'all skin routine. At the LEAST Invest in some almond oil and shea butter into y'all shit..
3098 2018-01-30 18:17:19 It's not just crypto down today, I'm getting all sorts of notifications of gas and oil and other stocks are down. I would love a explanation. It's crazy! #crypto #stocks

3105 2018-01-30 18:16:28 I agree. If the Sheikhs didn't takeover at Man City, then City would not now be known as Oil Money FC.
3106 2018-01-30 18:16:17 So wait, wind turbines will threaten tourism but an offshore oil spill won't? Cc: @mainecalling
3107 2018-01-30 18:16:16 @WatfordAudi and THEN every two weeks I had to go back to the dealership to fill up with oil whilst being convinced by management there that it was ‘general oil consumption’...
3108 2018-01-30 18:16:06 Listen half of the shit they show you, doesn't need to be changed. Don't fall for that mess next time. Just leave with your $30 oil change.
3109 2018-01-30 18:16:05 They say that oil can run dry from the well..... so what happens if the oil runs dry.....so does the money.... what would happen to them then? Play offs against Gillingham again????
3110 2018-01-30 18:16:05 Would you ever collab with Logan Paul, oil white, spells, Alfie deyes etc just for the views and money?
3111 2018-01-30 18:15:59 I just realized we can eat the play dough we made cause its just water, oil, flour, and kool aid so it's safe to eat but other people have touched/used it and who knows where they hands been 
3112 2018-01-30 18:15:52 stinky feet smell my feet in hot water and coconut oil and i love that but otherwise nah nooo
3113 2018-01-30 18:15:44 Take the oil and gas but can't a marijuana plant in it's place we will need it.
3114 2018-01-30 18:15:36 Melania you are bright note of  bioluminescense - a sparkling wave of beauty liming the dark and murky shore of politics polluted by oil interests and narcissistic male walruses - thank you for your outlook
3115 2018-01-30 18:15:31 Yea unless you can recover that oil then I wouldn’t bother with it. Will not be as good
3116 2018-01-30 18:15:13 I’d love a copy of @Rhitrition ‘s book because I love how she encourages us to eat real food! No fads - which of course includes good quality olive oil! #JERF

3119 2018-01-30 18:14:54 Price of gas was 60 cents a little, then the boom comes and it goes up to 1.15 a litre, boom ends and gas goes down to 95 cents a litre, the news says ,"yay gas is cheap". Now oil goes down and gas goes up. It's the next corprate test of social stupidity and the media is in on it

3127 2018-01-30 18:13:25 vitamin e oil is a go-to for me with face things. massage it for a bit. aquaphor is good for a protective barrier but it doesnt really get absorbed.
3128 2018-01-30 18:13:23 @davelackie I bought my first @ClarinsCanada lip oil today!!! (Had to share that with you!)
3129 2018-01-30 18:13:14 it should help! if not, try vitamin e oil. and maybe a gentle exfoliation? sometimes i get gross and just tweeze the dryness off and then use a washcloth to buff it off and then put the aquaphor on it. i'm sure that's against skincare law tho.
3130 2018-01-30 18:13:13 Omg I just highlighted my hair a little with bleach but smothered my hair in coconut oil and mixed it in with the bleach. 
My hair actually feels better now than it did before

3134 2018-01-30 18:13:04 Now tillerson can start drilling for oil on the land Exxon purchased two years ago. Isn’t that the whole reason he became Secretary of State ? To get rid of sanctions and make $$$ for him, Don and Putie. Looks like their scheme really worked!
3135 2018-01-30 18:13:03 no fr i’ve used coconut oil for the longest and its never made me break out  can’t relate to these humans
3136 2018-01-30 18:12:43 Raging that we now have no living room floor/dining room for at least a week thanks to warehouse staff at @AbingdonCarpets smearing the new carpet with oil whilst moving it for delivery to @ScSSofas!! How does that even happen!! Hope its sorted ASAP #carpetless #nothappy #crap
3137 2018-01-30 18:12:43 I need someone to make a good glycolic hand treatment (maybe a nail oil?) and more hand creams with spf.

3147 2018-01-30 18:11:31 About the letters?  Yup.  About the oil well?  To be determined.  If they start fracking down there, I guess I'll have my answer.
3148 2018-01-30 18:11:29 I’ve found my are better after taking evening primrose oil and magnesium. Worth a try?
3149 2018-01-30 18:11:27 1.Decided we as family really need to try and use #sustainable palm oil products - especially as part of my heritage is #Sumatran. So, I thought I'd explain the relationship between #deforestation and palm oil. After absolutely sobbing his head off and worrying about the tigers
3150 2018-01-30 18:11:22 They’re up city’s ass atm doing documentaries and looking into city owners lives for their prime show. Would prefer some oil money guy who’s a prince in Abu Dhabi or something lol

3154 2018-01-30 18:11:09 It’s a fact mate. Hes conned people into believing he’s this pure football coach. And he is anything but. The football might not be as good, but most coaches that have that spending power will be successful. All that oil money.
3155 2018-01-30 18:11:08 I came in for an oil change and I’m leaving with a $400 bill. Not today Satan.
3156 2018-01-30 18:11:05 I know. I wonder how many beaches will get coated in oil?

3172 2018-01-30 18:09:10 Made a vegan banana bread yesterday. Opened the microwave this morning and realized that the coconut oil I melted never made it into the cake. I now have a block of banana-flavored rubber. Everyone agreed it at least tastes decent.
3173 2018-01-30 18:08:58 The UN imposed those sanctions on Apartheid South Africa. The Reagan regime did its best to smuggle oil to S.A. despite the legal, UN sanctions.
3174 2018-01-30 18:08:57 It’s how you run a club “properly” if you are bankrolled by an oil based rentier state. But most clubs don’t enjoy that luxury.

3177 2018-01-30 18:08:53 Message to the rest of the world. Imagine if Hitler were ruling America with all its military hardware. What will you do when he wants your land, your oil , your uranium, your diamonds, your technology and wants to be rid of certain groups of people?
3178 2018-01-30 18:08:46 The chances of stumbling upon the life of your dreams while remaining glued to the path of least resistance are about the same as striking oil while digging a hole in your backyard. Success is for those who follow their heart, not the crowd..
3179 2018-01-30 18:08:34 Yes, in the air fryer and they turned out great!  Just how they would if fried in oil.  I went to our local Asian market.  Get the wrappers that are separated with paper, so much easier than pulling them apart lol

3184 2018-01-30 18:08:02 Time will tell.  I am afraid these are short term solutions to a bigger problem.  Do you really think pulling out of trade agreements, investing in old energy like coal and oil are going to help the USA in the long run ?  And removing environmental protections - good or bad ?
3185 2018-01-30 18:08:00 I am an American who feels it was our responsibility to stand by the Iraqi people until their government was able to stand on their own.We broke it, it was our duty to fix it.Instead withdrawing our troops allowed ISIS to thrive from black market oil killing thousands.

3192 2018-01-30 18:07:07 i've been using argan oil for the past two weeks, along w aloe vera (i put it on my whole face) & tea tree oil along w a himalaya anti acne cream & my face hasn't been this clear in at least two years. i wouldnt say my acne was severe but it was pretty bad & for the past month
3193 2018-01-30 18:07:03 Did Canadian oil sands companies vastly and recklessly over-invest and over-produce leading to shot-term gains for long-term pain? Short-term gains were the construction jobs and economic activity. Vast long-term pain is caused by the resulting discounted Canadian oil price.
3194 2018-01-30 18:06:56 @meechrp_ oil on you this weekend?

3197 2018-01-30 18:06:51 I know everyone(including myself) looking for oil/gold to break down hard here but just be mindful.  They may still run stops higher here.  Could easily bounce.

3207 2018-01-30 18:04:37 Vaseline isn’t a moisturizer it’s a sealant it locks in the moisture you’ve already got on your face. Might clog pores so better off w a cream based moisturizer on top of your oil of choice and doing weekly hydrating masks (if it works it’s just not a moisturizer)
3208 2018-01-30 18:04:34 Yeah well if a friend ever approaches me to suggest putting tea tree oil in my eye OR abusing opiods, that may be relevant to the question I asked

3213 2018-01-30 18:03:56 Kochs love the Trump Putin goal of keeping oil prices as high as possible. Russia and the American Oil Industry are comrades in arms in maintaining US oil energy dependency.

3216 2018-01-30 18:03:43 The board of Indian Oil Corporation has declared an interim dividend of Rs.19 per share of Rs.10/- each (i.e.@ 190%) for 2017-18. The interim dividend will be paid to the shareholders on or before February 28.
3217 2018-01-30 18:03:28 Is Guardiola really talking about not being to pay transfer fees? His club is backed by basically infinite oil money...
3218 2018-01-30 18:03:22 I'm wondering if it'd be worth doing what the oil painters do in making a colour chart. Say pick a red and mix a load of other colours to it and make swatches?

Time consuming but for a newbie like me it might give me a better understand of how colours mix with each other.

3224 2018-01-30 18:02:42 The dinosaurs had tons of oil and natural gas around in their time. They didn’t become oil workers.  What the H are we going to do with more oil and gas?  Use it to grow food and provide clean air and water?  That’s dinosaur think and a reason for paleontologists.
3225 2018-01-30 18:02:39 Thatcher and the Tories wasted North Sea oil money on paying dole.
Norway invested in society.
Which one is better off now?
3226 2018-01-30 18:02:19 why was i told to put coconut oil in my hair when all it does is make it look greasy as hell

3232 2018-01-30 18:02:01 The board of Indian Oil Corporation has recommended issue of 'Bonus Shares' in the ratio of 1 : 1 i.e. 1(One) new equity bonus share of Rs.10/- each for every 1 (One) existing equity share of Rs.10/- each fully paid up.
3233 2018-01-30 18:01:46 City’s oil money 
3234 2018-01-30 18:01:44 It’s oil tho. Oil = clogged pores. It wouldnt even moisturize your skin, it would just sit there.
3235 2018-01-30 18:01:35 Drop garlic oil in it as a diffuser too.
3236 2018-01-30 18:01:34 North Korea is only a shithole according to western media that continuously lies about everything from non-existent camps, to non-existent executions. Venezuela is not communist, not even Socialist, they have been heavily affected from the oil crisis which was a capitalist event
3237 2018-01-30 18:01:32 My ear is full of wax. I know, gross. The olive oil trick didn't work so now it's just clogged.
3238 2018-01-30 18:01:29 You’re a smart man @oilfractals, thanks for sharing your insights!
3239 2018-01-30 18:01:19 Well, Oil-Beef-Hooked there’s a response.

3244 2018-01-30 18:00:24 OIL DIFF: 4.32 -> 4.41
3245 2018-01-30 18:00:09 I use it for practically everything, I even put some of it in ogbono soup the other day.  Just that it grows a lot. Blending with olive oil seems to be the way to go.
3246 2018-01-30 18:00:06 What's that? My mom has been putting some sorta of lemon scented oil on it and leia hates it but I think she still licks when it wears off
3247 2018-01-30 17:59:54 Coconut Oil really does wonders hey!
3248 2018-01-30 17:59:46 I oiled my scalp and edges to protect them from damaging and breaking off. Still until this day, I oil my scalp and edges in my Box Braids. #naturalhair
3249 2018-01-30 17:59:44 I disagree about Putin’s interests being put ahead of ours. Putin’s only currency is energy. DJT wants to make the US an energy powerhouse including oil. That’s most def not in Putin’s interest. Selling them out Uranium was... but I agree about the memo.
3250 2018-01-30 17:59:44 I oil my skin with hot takes all day long

3253 2018-01-30 17:59:33 Castor oil is the answer.
3254 2018-01-30 17:59:30 Not too bothered whether we get Mahrez or not. It’ll just be funny if we do to watch the meltdown. Oil money. Ruining football. Spend what you earn. When the sheikh gets bored.
3255 2018-01-30 17:59:17 The plugged oil filter on the right can and will cause the engine damage you see on the left!!!
3256 2018-01-30 17:59:15 Oil money
3257 2018-01-30 17:59:07 As if man $ity need Mahrez aswell. Fuck me this oil rich clubs are ruining football. #DeadlineDay
3258 2018-01-30 17:59:01 Kind of disgraceful - but then what about this president isn't.

Listing campaign donors could cut both ways? Hope the networks find a way to highlight lobbying donations from banks, insurance companies, oil companies, the pharmaceutical industry and payday lenders.
3259 2018-01-30 17:58:54 Those oil state owners will not be happy.
3260 2018-01-30 17:58:54 Carry clean& clear oil absorbing sheets everywhere you go(even if u have makeup on, it won’t ruin it )

3263 2018-01-30 17:58:39 @maddow although you have a lot of fresh news, given the removal of sanctions, could you PLEASE re-visit the connection you made between Tillerson, Putin, Trump & the oil fields in Russia?
3264 2018-01-30 17:58:28 It's like saying "The commercial said that this oil was good for my car, and now it's running funny, WHAT A CON, no, I do not actually know what kind of oil my car should have, don't make me think." PEOPLE.
3265 2018-01-30 17:58:28 wait yall really putting coconut oil on ur faces? 
3266 2018-01-30 17:58:21 Oil field maps and directions are gonna be the death of me
3267 2018-01-30 17:58:13 day 17 in Greece: my blood has been replaced by olive oil, I smoke 50 cigarettes a day , I can sit and drink one coffee for 5 hours
3268 2018-01-30 17:57:56 - It is not a Russian Ship.
- It is not carrying oil.
- You are not in clear and present danger.
3269 2018-01-30 17:57:56 Im at the oil change place and this random black guy that works her says... “girl i aint seen you in a long time how you been” 

I was like i dont know you! 

He said i dont know you either...  

Oh black ppl...
3270 2018-01-30 17:57:39 Supporting the government is one thing. Supporting a president regardless of what he does is another. For example, Trump wants to drill for oil off both American coasts in spite of the ecological damage that could result. People have a right to protest this.
3271 2018-01-30 17:57:36 Luckily I’m currently getting an oil change. Here’s the thing not local team means you have to pick a team you can get full coverage of every single day. Unfortunately for you those are the top teams. Doesn’t make you a band wagoner if you pick one and stay with them.
3272 2018-01-30 17:57:36 You mean to say liberal govt officials have no idea where they're buying oil from, but reporters somehow know?  You really believe Trump makes empty threats? Well, I think you're one of the reasonable liberals who don't believe Trump is going to get us in a nuclear war.
3273 2018-01-30 17:57:27 It's a Whopper sandwich but you order WITHOUT fries and ask they leave of their shitty cheese, mayo & bacon.
At home you add your own cheddar, applewood smoked bacon & a fried egg you've kept warm in the toaster oven along with potato wedges fried in peanut oil.

3274 2018-01-30 17:57:23 Some of our customers never check their oil. It’s takes me longer to piss rather than drain most of these rigs. 
3275 2018-01-30 17:57:18 Every 10 dollars increase in crude oil price can reduce #indian #GDP growth by 0.3% and increase #WPI inflation by 1.7% #EconomicSurvey2018
3276 2018-01-30 17:57:16 It's not bias to report the facts as facts. And this is a fact: Scientific academies from all around the world have verified #climate change is real. Anybody who tells you different is probably trying to protect a dying industry (oil, coal etc.)
3277 2018-01-30 17:57:11 The pictures I saw of diff weapons bn brandished were alarming
3278 2018-01-30 17:57:03 Its oil money man.
3279 2018-01-30 17:56:58 The oil on my nose can literally fry up some chicken , it’s disgusting
3280 2018-01-30 17:56:56 What have we learned today? Well, bonds, dollar, oil, & stocks all sell in tandem. Higher rates unravels low vol strategy
3281 2018-01-30 17:56:56 We were big before that City would be irrelevant without oil money
3282 2018-01-30 17:56:56 Do you ever use it? You can blend it with olive oil and refrigerate. Or dry it.
3283 2018-01-30 17:56:54 Has anyone tried helicrysum, lemon, marula & lavender oil?

3290 2018-01-30 17:56:19 The Gas and Oil business is usually a boom or bust business sector! I would it could stabilize itself with fair prices for both consumers and producers! Maybe Government regulations getting in way of stability!
3291 2018-01-30 17:56:14 Russia is being hurt other ways one with us exporting oil Europe
3292 2018-01-30 17:56:02 I guess fair play rules don’t apply when you have oil money buying players. Who cares Utd Needs to perform on the pitch and hopefully city drop points
3293 2018-01-30 17:56:01 ask them to pay 150 million they will spend the same also.. they have tankers full of oil.. #ArabMoney

3298 2018-01-30 17:55:45 Hi! Use them in separate routines. You can do vit c in the morning and lactic at night or vice versa. Just make sure you’re consistent with sunscreen. Use the Luna oil at night.
3299 2018-01-30 17:55:44 Don't have pics, but I made these too! ONLY issue was maybe having to oil the dish just a biiiit more, but they only stuck a tiny a bit. Very fun and easy dish for sure!
3300 2018-01-30 17:55:33 When i look back at a time in my life in which i used to hate olive oil i know now im heading to the right direction.

3302 2018-01-30 17:55:28 My grandmother always used cast-iron indoors, without any issues of smoke. I have done the same. Perhaps you need to season the pan? I believe peanut oil was what was recommended to us but it’s been a long time...
3303 2018-01-30 17:55:10 Boss, you lost the subreme court case. Accept and move on. Baba beat you. Accept and move on. Also reduce the nonsense. It's too much now. How about you comment about the price of oil?
3304 2018-01-30 17:55:00 No, it the oil money. You haven’t earned it
3305 2018-01-30 17:54:56 I like it ripe you know loool but when it's too black it just retains bareeee oil 
3306 2018-01-30 17:54:54 they have oil tankers full of oil.. why give a chance for anyone when you can spend oil from your tanker and refill the oil again with those arab money...
3307 2018-01-30 17:54:52 And yet not a single one of those references is original research linking butter or coconut oil to heart disease, not a single one.  Meta analysis isn’t even original research, it’s just surfing on others work. Care to try again?
3308 2018-01-30 17:54:48 You mean....failure by POTUS to enforce Congress mandated required Russian sanctions, and will likely allow Exxon to make good on it's oil and gas deal in Russian artic zone with Tillerson and @realDonaldTrump chum Putin.

20) Arrest & Prision reform.
3311 2018-01-30 17:54:38 Spread out. They know people won't actually research because very few Americans make and stick to budgets.
When you start doing the math, it seems we will break even or have less.
Health costs are gonna go up, they always do, oil is going up again. Imports will cost more soon too
3312 2018-01-30 17:54:32 My mom left this morning for Baltimore until tomorrow night, and my house is freezing and I have no idea if we have enough oil for me to turn the heat up more 
3313 2018-01-30 17:54:18 Government will always be inefficient and Oklahomas is no different-spending continues at the same levels of when the economy was doing great because of high oil prices as it does when its tanking because of low oil prices.
3314 2018-01-30 17:54:17 I wonder who gets to oil cari champions legs lol

3317 2018-01-30 17:53:49 Tea tree oil has really saved my life.
3318 2018-01-30 17:53:47 This Russian oil tanker is in Boston Harbor. On our doorstep.. Russia knew they would not be turned back and did this to show their hold over Trmp. Which country would take the risk of sending an oil tanker all the way if they were humiliated and turned away?

3320 2018-01-30 17:53:37 PST would have helped AB economy immensely! With revenues drained after the corrupt/incompetent PCs & oil dropping like a rock, it would have been a smart move BUT think how those WRPs, PC remnants, and their shit-for-brains fanatics would have howled! Now they howl the debt.
3321 2018-01-30 17:53:22 Drill Baby Drill. Sarah Palin. Preachers. Oligarchs. Plutocrats. Mitch McConnell. Bandaids to disrespect John Kerry. Obstruction. Anti-Abortion fanatics. War for oil. Citizens United.  I could go on all day.
3322 2018-01-30 17:53:21 Indeed but he has the power and is the man whose decisions today could ensure whether we and most life survive on a habitable planet or not- sadly he has decided for Big OIL and does not listen to the most intelligent people on Earth but those with zero knowledge on the subject.
3323 2018-01-30 17:53:06 City is a state run club who fund themsleves from their own companies like Etihad etc they can Flex their muscles as they will because the oil is unlimited down there.
3324 2018-01-30 17:52:58 2016 or 2017 I read on @News24 about how a certain minister sold some of our oil reserves at a discountit had connection to the Guptas... I hope to see that addressed someday since the trains aren't too big as learnt today, yet they reported. #StateCapture #EskomEnquiry
3325 2018-01-30 17:52:51 But renewables are now adding more capacity each year than coal, oil and gas combined, so we'll see how that pans out.

3327 2018-01-30 17:52:42 This man has no right to run epa. He has ties to oil/gas industry. He lost 12 dept heads by not answering them or holding meetings, he sued epa more than once, he has a conflict of interest. He must go!

3330 2018-01-30 17:52:28 And have ranches in downtown Dallas, buy diamonds by the ton, chase cuties in our Cadillacs and drill oil wells just for fun
3331 2018-01-30 17:52:28 We sare not saying DON't use O/O. Just less. Virgin pressed rape seed oil from UK Is good for smoking points. An O/O is imported, but yes tasty in the RIGHT dishes. Use less of it when better alternatives are available.
3332 2018-01-30 17:52:26 they have oil tankers full of money.. why give a chance for anyone when you can spend oil from your tanker and refill the oil again with those arab money..

3335 2018-01-30 17:52:17 Islamism is lethal terror fascism. That's why it's so popular, historically speaking, with potentates, malevolent elites. Right now it's fueled by oil money. After 17 centuries of abuse at the hands of Catholicism, switching to its descendant, Islamism, would be serious regress!
3336 2018-01-30 17:52:14 I pakai cosmoderm tree tea oil tu. Yang warna kuning putih tu lah. Haha simple pun okay babe.
3337 2018-01-30 17:52:13 "Advocates of pure profit maximizing claim it best allocates resources, but they ignore externalities. Kessler misses the simplest reason to unload oil & gas stocks. They have been woefully underperforming in the market & appear likely to continue to do so." Lee Wasserman
3338 2018-01-30 17:52:10 I need to go get an oil change
3339 2018-01-30 17:52:06 you definitely should because of the condition but it might be like digging for oil now to find it because of the epidemic.
3340 2018-01-30 17:52:03 Russia has billions tied up in loans to Trump & money-laundering is blackmail leverage. Trump lifts sanctions, Tillerson oil & gas deal done, Putin aka Russia will be richest on earth—Trillions. Then Trump debts cancelled + huge cash profit to Trump— bonus=USA 3d World has been.

3348 2018-01-30 17:51:26 Ini sebenernya sunscreen tapi dalam bentuk cushion dan oil control juga. Kalo kamu emang niat pake sunscreen mendingan beli sunscreen cream/gel biasa (bukan cushion) karena bakalan cepat habis. The review that I watched on youtube said, ini tidak terlalu oil control.

3351 2018-01-30 17:51:14 We send ours down after just a clean and lights, oil & water check. That way if there is anything failed we have a checklist. Swear it has saved us so much money over the years. FIL = mechanic = handy!

3353 2018-01-30 17:51:05 Very pertinent questions.. 
Indirect Taxes consolidation will definitely boost revenues substantially beyond normal trends. Major concern is Oil prices, resultant fiscal slippage and what FM's plans to minimize impact
3354 2018-01-30 17:51:03 Texas and California are in the US top 10 states economically. Texas economy is based in Oil, California economy is based in Technology. Turn Texas Blue for a more reliable future. Saudi Arabia and Texas may be in trouble as oil fades.
3355 2018-01-30 17:51:01 I was frying eggs one morning and suddenly the hot oil popped up and nearly went in my eyes....Since then i be wearing Sunglasses anytime i fry eggs

3359 2018-01-30 17:50:23 Yes, no matter how much lotion or coconut oil I use.... it's a curse
3360 2018-01-30 17:50:18 Islamism is lethal terror fascism... And that's why it's so popular, historically speaking, with potentates and malevolent elites. Right now fueled by oil money. After 17 centuries of abuse at the hands of Catholicism, it would be regress to switch to its descendant, Islamism.
3361 2018-01-30 17:50:14 Because his other actions that go against your ridiculous claims dictates otherwise. IE; 59 missiles to a base in Syria Russian soldiers were stationed & the EOs allowing the USA to not only become energy independent but also to help alleviate Europe's dependency on Russian oil
3362 2018-01-30 17:50:09 And 'cannabis oil'.  Families are desperate.  It's terrible and terribly sad.

3365 2018-01-30 17:49:52 Ask yourself why Congress won't make Trump enforce the sanctions against Russia. Not only does the Republican congress and their fossil fuel dependent donor class share Putin's goal in keeping oil prices high, but they prefer the oligarchic model of government.

3424 2018-01-30 17:47:23 good - but really wonder if it's largely due to tax breaks or oil prices being on the rise? Investment levels from 2012-2016, when crude prices peaked, are about the same. Still - good news.

3427 2018-01-30 17:46:40 Many reasons. One is most likely the oil market collapse heavily affecting the Soviet Union after Gorbachev made more market reforms. The second is no doubt the fact that Gorbachev ignored democracy and destroyed the Soviet Union even though the majority wanted it to remain.

3430 2018-01-30 17:46:28 All of the patents are held in other countries, specifically China and Germany. Without imports of solar cells, our industry is dead. As many as 1 in 50 new jobs was in solar. This isn’t America first. It’s oil first. 2/2
3431 2018-01-30 17:46:27 Dyk Mayo was first marketed as beard oil and somebody was like jeez this tastes good and the legendary whipped dressing was born. Fact.
3432 2018-01-30 17:46:20 They had already invested $15B before #GOPTaxScam 

You sold America's beautiful coasts, oceans & natl parks to big oil. You sold out renewables & a healthy ecosystem for kickbacks. Disgusting.

3434 2018-01-30 17:46:00 Over £50mil for mahrez and pep said city can’t compete financially. Yet nearly £60mil on a ball playing defender and now mahrez hmmm interesting. Oil prices must have gone up
3435 2018-01-30 17:46:00 "Climategate" was a bogus scandal promoted by oil company cash & it didn't change any of the scientific findings about how warm the world is getting & how acidic the ocean has become. Republicans and Democrats both agree on this.
3436 2018-01-30 17:45:54 I really hope we just spend stupid amounts of money before the window closes. Get Mahrez, Fred, and let’s just bid for messi, because why not. We are oil money cunts and it’s great
3437 2018-01-30 17:45:42 I once developed a pretty strong theory regarding Burkean conservatism while using Kiehl’s Midnight Oil.

3453 2018-01-30 17:44:03 Albania is part of the EU accession framework and gets a lot of cover from the EU. Angola is oil rich and both part of SADC and AU frameworks. Argentina builds on Mercosur and Antigua and Barbuda is part of Caricom.

All benefit from and work with collective trade frameworks.
3454 2018-01-30 17:44:00 Well aparantly miricles do as having a beard was meant to mean i smell of beer and engine oil rolled in tabacco

3456 2018-01-30 17:43:55 Lmao...your so right, it's wrong. Oil sheiks laundering money through Etihad, and pumping into their plaything. @premierleague must be taking a brown envelope not to investigate?!
3457 2018-01-30 17:43:55 I thought this said "Oil Painting." I was really confused.
3458 2018-01-30 17:43:51 I started shaving my legs with body oil and my skin has never felt sooo hydrated  s/o @Nazaninkavari
3459 2018-01-30 17:43:49 You really have no idea how the industry works do you. We build and install panels here. We cannot develop or build the parts here because we are lightyears behind in technology because we have relied on oil and not funded the research into alternatives. 1/2
3460 2018-01-30 17:43:36 Both FT and Bloomberg report that renewables are adding more capacity each year than coal, oil and gas combined
3461 2018-01-30 17:43:34 Industry and oil interests are already pushing back on AB 1745, let's unpack some of the claims for a moments and see if they stand up to even basic scrutiny. 1/

3464 2018-01-30 17:43:26 reduction of oil costs was key. Would like to see build time reductions on future events.
3465 2018-01-30 17:43:20 I'll tell you what. When Canada has a free market, wake me up and let me know. Right now, we are hostages to the US market, and won't allow our own oil to flow east or west, other than a trickle on the existing TransMountain pipeline. Gotta run, have a nice day.

3468 2018-01-30 17:42:59 Balmer is as meddling as Gilbert. But at least Balmer isn’t an absolute power hungry lunatic. Cleveland stays getting waxed by snake oil salesmen.
3469 2018-01-30 17:42:58 Reduction in childhood death also cannot be attributed to capitalism, given that it’s happening all over the world. What’s worse is that a strong case can be made against capitalism’s ability to improve health - pharma industry, 80% of which is snake oil garbage.
3470 2018-01-30 17:42:50 I’ve heard on this same thread that is was a mixture of CE making terrible choices as well as bad economic governance from the state.

I never blamed tax cuts for this...what? But please, explain how Obama destroyed big oil.
3471 2018-01-30 17:42:48 Today I saw a dude wiping a *clean* tampon across his face because he “thought it got the oil off” so yeah my college career has peaked

3473 2018-01-30 17:42:43 It astounds me how utter garbage and bug-filled enterprise software solutions are. It's just snake oil sales. Emailing zip files is superior. But as the saying goes, "you never get fired for recommending IBM".

It reinforces my dedication to #open-source #FOSS at every turn.
3474 2018-01-30 17:42:30 You what ?? Hahahaha Manchester United are the biggest profit making club in the world.. If them oil rags left City you'd be fucked.. United will still trade if the Glazers left..
3475 2018-01-30 17:42:08 Improv until I get the furniture to put them on. Its loud. You have to yell to be able to talk inside of the room. I am working on sound proofing the room too. Also testing dielectric fluid to put them on oil. My only concern is the heat of my country.

3478 2018-01-30 17:41:54 At all. Since City got taken over by the oil billionaire they been spending on a mad one to get to where they are now. We don’t mind it cos Chelsea did the same. But people go on like United are the only big spenders. Meanwhile City are spending 100ms+ every season
3479 2018-01-30 17:41:50 The Sunflower Oil by @HumanNaturePhil really is amazing for the hair and the skin 

My face looks brighter and healthier. My hair is soft and stronger ((important because I almost always put it in a bun now))

3483 2018-01-30 17:41:21 people sharing mouth-watering pictures of food, with recipes headlined by words like "healthy" consisting mainly of agave syrup and coconut oil (and thus more fat and sugar than my self-loathing), all deserve to run out of hot water while showering
3484 2018-01-30 17:41:21 Please am him and his principal in the government why the price of oil is still high rate, And high rate of unemployment is still at high rate. He's a failure for him to be in that government with his principal buhari.#notmygovernment
3485 2018-01-30 17:41:17 In a rare move, Iraq allows buyers to load crude without saying where the cargo will finally end up. They will only have to let Iraq know about the destination 2 weeks after the shipment’s bill of lading < 4 MMbbl of Iraq's March supply was sold via auctions this month #Oil #Iraq

3487 2018-01-30 17:41:13 110 million bid for 2 players after he said that city can’t compete with the big spenders is pretty embarrassing from Pep IMO, he’s the best around but let’s not lose sight of what City are and have been since the oil money came in, @GuillemBalague maybe u wish to chime in?

3490 2018-01-30 17:40:58 Mr. Gore Germany is not the one you need to aim these statements at. Trump is the one that needs to be hit with any issues of coal or oil for that matter of fact. Germany is doing freat job on use of clean energy.
3491 2018-01-30 17:40:51 People have been rubbing oil on their bodies a really long time it just comes in fancy bottles now. Who cares

3499 2018-01-30 17:40:09 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
3500 2018-01-30 17:40:08 Someone needs to think this through. If you oppose this then oppose using oil from the gulf coast states.
3501 2018-01-30 17:40:04 what do u call a white mom who has monopolies on the oil and/or steel industries?

a robber SHARON
3502 2018-01-30 17:40:03 In other words I now Nic about the whole thing but my oil and coal supporters tell me what to do.
3503 2018-01-30 17:39:56 Establish, whatever the hell you want to label it as. If you must know I work in the engineering sector and the work we do is exclusively oil and gas. Working with companies such as BHI, Schlumberger etc. Believe what you wish though pal. The oil is in U.K. waters

9. Automocratic
10. Pastryot
3505 2018-01-30 17:39:49 Precisely. Dude coulda keep that attempted bid story all to himself. Why crucify him for it cause he’s a billionaire’s son? How many silver spoon kids would leave the comfort of managing companies in Telecoms  and Oil & Gas for foray into unchartered waters?
3506 2018-01-30 17:39:45 yall, i’ve been using rose hip oil on my face and it’s amazing?? my skin feels like a baby’s butt @.@
3507 2018-01-30 17:39:38 We need to get kreonke out so we can spend some of this Usmanov oil money ...
3508 2018-01-30 17:39:33 Most of my problems are solved with coconut oil tbh
3509 2018-01-30 17:39:20 When you find out Cadillac is paying for your oil change because you’ve got the premium Escalade
3510 2018-01-30 17:39:19 Oh oh! L’idéal, sans beurre et avec du cacao! CHOCOLATE OLIVE OIL CAKE
3511 2018-01-30 17:38:57 Coconut oil is not good for your face.
3512 2018-01-30 17:38:57 Coconut oil doesn't do shit for me
3513 2018-01-30 17:38:48 Will that “investment” be for oil spill cleanup and environmental remediation?
3514 2018-01-30 17:38:48 Currently using @acureorganics rosehip oil! Been tryna get my hands on the ordinary products but they're always sold out! & reselled for twice the price from different sites
3515 2018-01-30 17:38:44 Every time I go get an oil change it's a diff price like wtf I'm poor and don't have the funds for your made up prices!
3516 2018-01-30 17:38:41 PetroChina, the country’s biggest O&G producer, forecast that full-year profit may have tripled amid cost cutting & higher energy prices < net income for 2017 may have jumped by as much as $2.5 bn #Oil #China #PetroChina #business
3517 2018-01-30 17:38:32 ルーラが言ってた
OILって3回書いて点を打つと音がサザエさんっぽくなるって
3518 2018-01-30 17:38:31 They're ruining football. The sooner something gets done about these oil clubs, the better the sport will be for it.
3519 2018-01-30 17:38:29 Nothing compares to gold. I'd argue oil hasn't even really paid for its pre 2008 sins ($140) We had the blip in 08 followed by another 6+ year $100+ party. Now after 2014, the oil party is on AGAIN. And gold is STILL dead.
3520 2018-01-30 17:38:27 I have NEVER liked coconut oil tbqfh. It gives off a slightly sour smell after being on the body and idk how y’all do it. I keep Shea butter on DECK though.
3521 2018-01-30 17:38:22 Love the oil money!
3522 2018-01-30 17:38:21 Current mood: I just put stress relief essential oil up my nose
3523 2018-01-30 17:38:20 My overall point is this bro. With the small knowledge I have abt business. It's a risk and it is worth taking, oil companies knew that oil will definitely dry up one day, they wld need better equipment n they still delved in. They always bring in new modern facilities
3524 2018-01-30 17:38:07 BPA plastic microscopic particles shed in pipes weakening Americans’ Immunity causes cancer & other illness.  Trump needs to switch BPA Water pipes to metal pipes.
For BIGGER MONEY turn Golf courses to CBD oil plantations & Less Healthcare need. PLEASE SEND TO ADVISORS OR MEDIA
3525 2018-01-30 17:38:06 In the grim darkness of the far future, the intent matters less than the meme itself
3526 2018-01-30 17:37:58 Such a productive day, paid our bills, for my oil changed, tires rotated and now I’m going todo homework before my doctor appointment
3527 2018-01-30 17:37:55 I have no knowledge on oil drilling, your theory seems to make sense otherwise tankers would have been seen it guess
3528 2018-01-30 17:37:36 Si Mead es Carlos Andrés Pérez y Anaya es Rafael Caldera, AMLO es Hugo Chávez. Cuando eliminen al PRIAN y vean que la realidad no es rosa, van a protestar o se van a ir del país?
3529 2018-01-30 17:37:35 Thought City had run out of oil/money.
3530 2018-01-30 17:37:18 นุช เป็นกำลังใจให้น๊า อย่าเพิ่งท้อ ตราบที่ยังมีหนทาง แปลว่ายังมีหวัง เราก็ต้องสู้!!
3531 2018-01-30 17:37:18 Let’s talk about how I ran out of gorilla glue oil and I was inconsolable until I re-upped.
3532 2018-01-30 17:37:17 ฮรึก กดสั่งซื้อไปทางไหนคะ พ่ายแพ้มากๆ ถถถถถถ กลัวจะอุทานเป็นชื่อพ่อคนเขียนตอนอ่านจัง จริงๆเค้ายังไม่ได้อ่านเล่ม4ด้วยซ้ำ แต่เห็นกระแส(ด่า)เล่มนี้แรงมากเรื่องใจพังเลยอยากลอง 
3533 2018-01-30 17:37:06 The less oil there is in the world the more expensive the oil remaining will be, the sheik is going nowhere
3534 2018-01-30 17:37:06 Niggas played Lil baby to the top almost cried we was T’d off the oil
3535 2018-01-30 17:36:57 While you are at it. Stop using oil from the gulf coast state's
3536 2018-01-30 17:36:52 Absolutely, "healthy oils" sales grows YOY in India -  every year diabetes hits all time high in India. Latest fad being Rice bran oil
3537 2018-01-30 17:36:49 Coconut oil isn’t for oily skin or acne prone skin or oily hair. I’ve been using it on my face for 2 years with no problems but not my hair
3538 2018-01-30 17:36:49 This kid is smoking in his lambo next to me and I'm 1,000 miles overdue for an oil change.
3539 2018-01-30 17:36:45 Hmmmm. 'Snake oil'. That's one view, Ty!
3540 2018-01-30 17:36:34 when cryptos start representing your value...that value is enshrined in the blockchain forever and could be trusted..it cannot be manipulated or hacked for the benefit of the few..you have to think a little outside the box as to what is coming..:)
3541 2018-01-30 17:36:30 Put on apricot oil, the kind found in health-food stores, to protect cuticles from turning rough and raggedy.
3542 2018-01-30 17:36:04 contoh muka jenis oily pakai bio oil before tidur okay ke? thank you
3543 2018-01-30 17:35:50 I'm dumb and tried coconut oil to whiten teeth - I had some and was looking for uses - I ended up with a pimple under my tongue for a week. ._.
3544 2018-01-30 17:35:50 Daft? Coz I said your club doesn’t have history?!  That’s just FACTS mate. No one outside of England knew about you scum, before oil money took over. FACTS! Manchester is  and always will be
3545 2018-01-30 17:35:47 ... And we are not allowed to go to #Ikea or talk to sales people selling snake oil at #Bett2018
#edtech
3546 2018-01-30 17:35:40 I see FFP is being mentioned again... because apparently City make no money at all and it’s all oil money obviously. Ruining football and all that 
3547 2018-01-30 17:35:36 MMS, CBD, oregano oil, crystal therapy, quantum healing, & vaginal steaming where indicated. Plus a healthy diet and lifestyle. You know, all integrated.
3548 2018-01-30 17:35:32 Came to Toyota to get my oil changed and ended up being filmed for a commercial. I don’t find fame. Fame finds me 
3549 2018-01-30 17:35:27 But how y'all use and how I use oils probably completely different. Every oil works for everyone differently. So far every oil loves me. 
3550 2018-01-30 17:35:24 Baby shampoo bc is gentle and without harsh chemicals & coconut oil so you don’t dry out your bristles and breaks down hard makeup well. To add to it get an abrasive surface like the sigma glove (forever 21 has cheap dupes)
3551 2018-01-30 17:35:23 Bruh I been waiting for an oil change for 2 hours now WTF
3552 2018-01-30 17:35:20 Yeah, I’ll eat asparagus any way!!  grilled w/ olive oil garlic salt and pepper is the bomb as well!
3553 2018-01-30 17:35:10 Didn't he use oil to cure seizures and blindness in the Bible? If only we new of a plant who's oil had such medicinal effects? Oh...wait.....
3554 2018-01-30 17:35:10 Oil prices in #Alberta hit the $60 mark as we usher in New Year
3555 2018-01-30 17:35:04 Well with no sanctions in place Russia can sell their weapons and oil to anybody and make lots of money and what about our weapons we want to sell.  Guess big businesses takes a hit because #DIPPERDONNIE is supporting PUTIN  what he couldn't have got a better divorce settlement
3556 2018-01-30 17:35:00 Its nothing to do with debt. Its about ur income vs expenditure  without sugar daddy's oil money you will be in championship
3557 2018-01-30 17:34:57 Somebody pls oil my scalp 
3558 2018-01-30 17:34:43 And pay a 30% fee for using oil from the gulf coast states. Moron!

3561 2018-01-30 17:34:00 40+years in the EU and look at the state of this country our oil & gas revenue squandered proping up poorer EU countries its left us with collapsing NHS housing crisis, record child poverty, homelessness record rents &house prices food banks & migrants preying on our children Gr8
3562 2018-01-30 17:33:58 Everybody don turn "Oil Economist" ....Lol!
3563 2018-01-30 17:33:54 Seen the latest accounts??? Get figures right before you try and crack a funny!!!! Revenue earned??? Let’s talk about that - oil benefactors??? Where shall we start????
3564 2018-01-30 17:33:47 Prueba de que siempre se puede estar peor: si Mead es como Carlos Andrés Pérez (corrupto), y Anaya es como Rafael Caldera (oligarca), Andrés Manuel es nuestro Hugo Chávez (carismático).  A votar.
3565 2018-01-30 17:33:46 @ManCity : " We dont any more money to spend thats why we couldnt buy @Alexis_Sanchez. "

Next week:
@ManCity : " Oh wait, we actually have a bit of oil left. We can buy mahrez!!! "
3566 2018-01-30 17:33:39 There is serious hold up in Ikeja,Mangoro,Cement,Mafoluku,Airport,oshodi.... In case you wanna ply those routes
3567 2018-01-30 17:33:38 Typical oil city trying to get the attention on deadline day. Surely a 6 week lay off for sane should give foden a chance? Obviously pep is a fraud and doesn't give academy players a chance
3568 2018-01-30 17:33:38 We just added organic CBD oil to our  essential oils inventory. available in natural, cappuccino, mint and strawberry, ridiculously low prices/

3570 2018-01-30 17:33:18 Do a good job. You’ll need to be prepared for the first oil spill in ANWR.
3571 2018-01-30 17:33:00 We have oil, we have gas, why not save $ and drill?

3576 2018-01-30 17:32:30 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
3577 2018-01-30 17:32:16 Tea tree oil is good but you should cut it w something bc it can burn you. It’s very potent
3578 2018-01-30 17:32:12 I’m confused because I def use Dr. Bronners and moisturize with coconut oil but I don’t make any recommendations because I’m not a dermatologist and not in the mood to be dragged.
3579 2018-01-30 17:32:10 U mean the year GDP and markets up, unemployment down tax break oil exports up businesses investing in America. Wow what a bad year.

3582 2018-01-30 17:32:06 I thought about my new yorker subscription bc of the #skincare debate apparently happening on twitter today. Have people who have oily skin probs ever considered that they just need *more oil*
3583 2018-01-30 17:32:06 เหงา
3584 2018-01-30 17:32:02 A lot of earth scientist go into positions in industry (especially oil & gas) where they no longer see rocks in the flesh but it doesn't mean they don't develop into a better earth scientist. Still can't beat it though!
3585 2018-01-30 17:31:54 @arunjaitley 
2 yrs ago,All in Davos praised our FM for keeping The Indian Finance in order & stronger by hard way checking Govt Deficits, Govt Borrowings, Banking in Forex Reserves and by imposing “Levy on Cheap Oil Prices”,,,it’s “A Master Stroke” it's great,Sir
3586 2018-01-30 17:31:52 gold, silver meant large populations were enslaved under kings/queens..fiat currency destroyed that..and everybody could get paid for their skills..but then fiat currency got overproduced and manipulated for the few..it does not represent true value anymore
3587 2018-01-30 17:31:51 まだ軍票のほうが信頼度ある気がする
3588 2018-01-30 17:31:43 So electric vehicles and Shale start to fall under the control of Big Oil. This is not about profit this is about controlling the path of these industries that best serves big oil, not the industries themselves.

3593 2018-01-30 17:30:38 What happened to the biased media bashing big clubs like Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool for overspending. Why are they so quiet now? We earn our profits. We don’t use oil money to buy players like it’s a freaking Black Friday sale FFS.
3594 2018-01-30 17:30:38 Why was there a Russian oil tanker docked in Boston Harbor over the weekend?
3595 2018-01-30 17:30:30 I agree. So don't take oil from my Louisiana.

3598 2018-01-30 17:30:18 Y ahora anuncian los campamentos y la continuación de la protesta. Quizás quieran que quienes no tenemos ningún beneficio, quienes pagamos la ute, el gas oil, los impuestos y somos dependientes trabajemos un par de horas extras para donarlas a los pobres millonarios del campo.
3599 2018-01-30 17:30:15 Gear oil ! Get Er Done
3600 2018-01-30 17:30:15 I would push back on 1 and 2. Trump promised he'd "bomb the shit out of ISIS" but not get involved in expensive land wars a la Iraq, and, if he did, he'd be openly colonial and "take the oil" or other resources. That ain't reticence. (1/x)

3608 2018-01-30 17:30:00 Gatau... w rada ngeri soalnya klo dipake di bump, dimuka aja itu tree tea oil body shop kaya rada mengandung mint gitu perih2
Tp klo ada coba aja...
klo mo beli baru di shopee yg pure essential tea tree oil 5ml cuma 27rebu kogg
3609 2018-01-30 17:29:56 I recall the price of oil being something in the $150bb range in 2008 - wonder if there was a better comparison in like 2000-2002 that could be equated.
3610 2018-01-30 17:29:44 I know when trading we don't give a sh1t about people but know that if you're enjoying #OIL rallying, know that your cousin or uncle or someone you know is paying the price (literally) for the increase in oil prices.
3611 2018-01-30 17:29:44 Olive oil. Citrus. A little wine or vinegar. Salt/pepper/whatever seasonings. Boom. Salad dressing.

You could also freeze the sections and use them as ice cubes, since it's still hot as fuck.
3612 2018-01-30 17:29:38 Santi is a Creative midfielder. Rarely scores but does all the passes and has lots of assists.
Oil is more of a Attacking midfielder. Not only does he create he then pushes up gets in the box.
3613 2018-01-30 17:29:36 State how many champions league U've won without the oil rig
3614 2018-01-30 17:29:28 From the positioning point of view, #oil remains quite vulnerable to the downside.. and if it resolves in that direction, this should boos the dollar and put a short term bottom under fixed income
3615 2018-01-30 17:29:21 it's time to olive oil your situation

3620 2018-01-30 17:29:07 Oh I never had those! I hear you just can’t use anything oil based on them.
3621 2018-01-30 17:29:02 If you can't see Tillerson is in it for the money so the largest oil deal in the world proceeds with Russia, then you're blind or willfully ignorant. His financial investment in the Exxon-Rosneft oil deal is worth billions to Tillerson ("ex" CEO of Exxon)
3622 2018-01-30 17:29:00 I agree. But I know next to nothing on the tech behind the cryptos. I'm just wondering if we can expand that money supply the way we can fiat today? A fixed amount of currency without expansion benefits the rich (who'll hoard it and find ways to game it and control an economy).
3623 2018-01-30 17:28:59 To be fair, there are more pressures on OC from above (state) to create 'hoods that waste less land, use less energy/water, have more transit/bike/walk trips, etc. It's difficult to do better in AB b/c oil/gas industry's run counter to these outcomes. Ditto homebuilders locally.
3624 2018-01-30 17:28:56 Drain the Swamp and fill it will coal and oil. Fish can't breathe oil, humans can't breathe coal. Coal isn't making a comeback.
3625 2018-01-30 17:28:56 So are you going to allow for oil exploration on the Oregon coast now Zinke?
3626 2018-01-30 17:28:52 TRUDUMB KNOWS HE WILL NOT GET VOTES FROM THE WEST SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT SEPARATING FROM CANADA AND SHUTTING OFF THE OIL FOOD AND START OUR OWN COUNTRY BUILD PIPE LINES AND SELL OUR WHEAT, PRODUCE OUR OWN FOOD AND NEVER GIVE ANY MONEY TO THE EAST !
3627 2018-01-30 17:28:47 You could also clean with coconut oil!
3628 2018-01-30 17:28:46 I hope the execution is good, and not designed to push ppl back to oil. Sorry! It has to be said. Oil companies have displayed massive dishonesty for decades, and have not yet been brought to account. So why not try to screw up renewables?

3632 2018-01-30 17:28:38 It’s all smoke and mirrors. Trump is slashing regs that protected people and the environment, just to satisfy big biz. Trump took the “easy” steps to get short-term results. When it all blows apart we’ll be left with oil rigs in our national parks....
3633 2018-01-30 17:28:36 TWO HOURS FOR AN OIL CHANGE oh my god I can’t handle this, I get so anxious waiting around I’m about to start biting walls or smth

3636 2018-01-30 17:28:27 Whoever sold the naming rights to @UnitedAirlines for the LA Memorial Colisieum is a snake oil salesman at its finest.. No one born before 2010 will every call it the "United Airlines Colisieum." Naming rights only work on new venues, think about it.

3649 2018-01-30 17:27:15 So you think US representation should just cover the populated states. That's exactly what the framers of the Constitution meant to avoid by including ALL UNITED STATES! We're not buying your snake oil.

3654 2018-01-30 17:26:38 Life Long Dem. here. As a life long resident of Louisiana let me say this. If California doesn't want offshore drilling I say don't take oil from the Cult Coast States. How's that for food for thought?
3655 2018-01-30 17:26:35 If you don't have WD 40 try olive oil

3657 2018-01-30 17:26:23 @SandraLeeMD is it ok to use coconut oil as makeup remover if I have combination skin? Or should I stick to micellar water? Thanks!!
3658 2018-01-30 17:26:18 He fought his then-wife tooth and nail in their divorce, even though he was a nobody with few funds when they got together. One friend told me, "I like Mike, but Mike's a snake oil salesman."
3659 2018-01-30 17:26:14 It's awful, and greedy, and selfish. The part I don't get is why anyone is surprised - Trump has always been a snake oil salesman, profiting from misleading others. #resist
3660 2018-01-30 17:26:01 Currency trading wasn't it? And the wealth in Abu Dhabi comes from oil not slave labour. And don't get me started on Spurs & all they did to rig the system.
3661 2018-01-30 17:25:58 I asked my dad for an oil change for Christmas it's bout to be February
3662 2018-01-30 17:25:57 Coconut oil is cool and all... you can use it for so many things but I ain't using it to moisturize my face... I'd prolly bump up quick af.
3663 2018-01-30 17:25:57 Wo ho s3 anointing oil bottle.
3664 2018-01-30 17:25:45 let's go get oil poured on our third eyes right now, btw
3665 2018-01-30 17:25:42 Bicarbonate of soda ( think thats the same thing?) Equal measures of it and coconut oil and peppermint oil to flavour. Results are amazing.
3666 2018-01-30 17:25:42 tnx sa baby oil tips 
3667 2018-01-30 17:25:32 I use Tide but I also put just a little bit of Dawn dish washing soap too. Helps get the oil out
3668 2018-01-30 17:25:25 All I can say is well guess what. We told you he was a liar. We told you he was full of shit. We told you he was a snake oil salesman. You chose to believe him instead.

3672 2018-01-30 17:25:09 Hate going to get oil for my car 
3673 2018-01-30 17:24:59 I use a cleansing oil (Josie Maran) - direct application to face, nice long massage. Unless my skin is being particularly dry, I follow with a foaming cleanser (Ole Henrikson, Red Tea).  Toner depends on season.  Right now, Lancome Hydrating. Serums depend.  Moisturizer too.
3674 2018-01-30 17:24:58 thanky ... yung mga oil san nkakabili hahaha
3675 2018-01-30 17:24:58 @DemonicVeggies do you have a scientific reference for the link between butter or coconut oil and heart disease?
3676 2018-01-30 17:24:52 Hmm it seem the PC gov forgot to collect a couple billion in oil royalties.  Whoops, just institute austerity measures.
3677 2018-01-30 17:24:38 Oh, and get this, CDN oil production is over capacity so exports to USA price keep dropping - yet $ at the pump in Canada goes up... #WTF #ScrewingCanadians

If your oil pressure gauge begins to drop and your coolant temperature is on the rise, which has likely happened? 
A. Your oil level is low because of a broken oil line, blown gasket or lost drain plug
B. Your coolant level is low
C. Your gauges are broken
3693 2018-01-30 17:22:57 Must be worried about the oil drying up
3694 2018-01-30 17:22:43 Too faced born this way concealer or tarte's shape tape concealer with a drop of facial oil will DEFINITELY help!
The nars creamy concealer can be drying since I have combination skin but have dry undereyes. I use oil with that too and some setting spray.
Good luck!!
3695 2018-01-30 17:22:29 Long ass day.

I just want oil and gas money without stressing myself so much.

Is that too much to ask for?

3701 2018-01-30 17:21:52 True, olive oil is essential.
3702 2018-01-30 17:21:44 I double cleanse when I wear makeup. Cotton doused in either oil based cleanser or Eskinol cleanser, then facial wash.
3703 2018-01-30 17:21:40 For the coverage and oil control, I just feel like it sometimes causes breakouts when I wear it too much.

3709 2018-01-30 17:21:12 It's a great list but I need olive oil or I'll die.

3721 2018-01-30 17:20:02 Its all fun & games when you have a car till you need an oil change, new breaks, your car insurance is due, car note is due, & some new tires ..
3722 2018-01-30 17:19:51 I don't care about what other people make. I care about government and fiscal policy. Racking up debt without investing will cause another crash and global recession. The US thrives on their global currency, which is based on oil trade and trust. Both are running out.

Idk if its the oil or what but i always get a cough attack after one big puff.

3734 2018-01-30 17:17:55 None of the forecasts ever produced by the Treasury have been accurate.

They can’t forecast for 1 year, let alone 15

Can you forecast what your life/prosperity might be in 15 years?

Try, and then throw in an economic crash (2008) or halving of oil price (2016)

It’s impossible

3739 2018-01-30 17:17:20 Yeah, I've been doing olive oil in the old ears twice a week for four years, but it doesn't seem to stop them being infection prone because there's eczema and scarring in both ear canals that seems to make infections easy and nasty. Hate then so much!

3744 2018-01-30 17:17:08 I haven't noticed this at all. People complaining this are the ones that are trying to complain that there is less sharpness and they didn't know what word to say and finally called it oil paint and water paint. Most of this is the result of them not knowing how to hold camera.
3745 2018-01-30 17:17:05 Can we expand crypto currencies like the way we can regular currencies in case we need it? Because having only a set amount of a certain currency flowing favors the rich. That's why right-wing "libertarians" love the gold standard so much. They just want the rich to get richer.

3766 2018-01-30 17:14:23 25% are Christians and Muslims. Most Israelis are not religious. Some are even agnostics and atheists. Religion is only a tool used in politics. The West has to be close to the oil and the strategic point between Asia, Africa and Europe. Palestine history full of invaders.

3772 2018-01-30 17:13:45 I found something that has taken my headaches away totally. I saw an article in the paper about hemp oil & I researched it, also listened to a woman at a craft fair talk about it, she had sample bottles so I tried it. That was in November,I have not had any headaches since.

El sindicato de UTE dijo que se podia bajar un 15% la tarifa, bueno, queremos ése 15%.
El gas oil importado puede estar a $31,8, bueno, lo queremos a ése precio, bajar presión imposi

- to abolish DST

- a single time zone 
- stop oil wars

3819 2018-01-30 17:09:47 Expansions don't die of old age, but labor market tightness & oil are triggering inflation levels where FED will likely raise 2-3 times this year. When that yield curve inverts, count on a recession in 6-12mo. My current est is market retreats in fall '19, recession by mid '20.
3820 2018-01-30 17:09:42 Still no fair play rule? City allowed to spend what they want again bloody oil money!
3821 2018-01-30 17:09:40 coconut oil is greatness...
3822 2018-01-30 17:09:32 the problem with today's systems..are there is no trust..and we have more and more inciompetence being rewarded because there are loopholes in the system..blockchain will bring in trust in everything..american democracy was hacked by the russians and trump
3823 2018-01-30 17:09:30 For shiny hair, mix one egg with a olive oil and apply to your hair. Leave it on for 20-30 minutes then shower.

3833 2018-01-30 17:08:46 In skincare routine, when should we put face oil? After toner and before serum or after serum?
3834 2018-01-30 17:08:41 It beats taking photocopies though doesn't it. Still didn't he tell us he knew where the oil was and he'd resign if a @PL_Malta @MaltaGov didn't find it in 6 months? Oh wait, accountability.
3835 2018-01-30 17:08:41 Anyone who's wondering about lovefest between trump and putin? Pick up book "Collusion"by Luke Harding. You'll start getting true picture by the 40th page....oil, money and sex. Blackmail hanging over trumps head. Also watch Rachel Maddow nightly....not sure why so many questions
3836 2018-01-30 17:08:29 Black soap and coconut oil, I swear by it.
3837 2018-01-30 17:08:29 Gold, oil, bonds and stocks all down ..great example of how cross asset relationships can do the unexpected. BTC is also getting smoked, but I don’t consider crypto to be an asset class. Lots of noise today..strong earnings and a steeper yield curve should be the focus.
3838 2018-01-30 17:08:12 @oilfractals thanks for the post today! Down arrows looking good!
3839 2018-01-30 17:08:06 But oreos arnt vegan. They have palm oil which is a massive industry that cuts down trees in rhw rainforrest which is home to orangutans and other animals. They do this without caring about what happens to them. You can be vegan without palm oil!

3851 2018-01-30 17:06:20 Yeah bio oil ! It takes like a good 2 weeks to a month depending on how dark they are , but it takes then away completely. I put it on every night before bed and in the morning !
3852 2018-01-30 17:06:17 I find that fuckin filter and change the oil myself fuck voiding the fuckin warranty
3853 2018-01-30 17:06:15 You might wanna have a look at "Strandings" by Rebecca Solnit in January's Harper's. The collusion might be about Arctic Oil.

3858 2018-01-30 17:05:51 Why are you promoting palm oil (oreos)? It is a huge industry that cuts down animals habitats, hurting and killing animals. You can be vegan without palm oil. Dont reduce one form of cruelty by promoting another one!
3859 2018-01-30 17:05:41 Here are a few more (with agenda to get a heads up what you he enemies are up to: Al Monitor, Eurasia Net, Oil Price, Open Secrets)
3860 2018-01-30 17:05:21 A lot has changed since 2016, Senator. If Pruitt said this today, I'd be impressed but he's just another owned Trump puppet now, pushing oil and coal on us while destroying our environment by lifting toxic chemical restrictions. #GOPGreed #BribedPoliticians
3861 2018-01-30 17:05:16 If City win the league this year, I'll congratulate them, for their style of play, I'll applaud them. But NEVER ask me to Respect them. Anyone can afford the best house, when they discover an oil well in the back garden.

3870 2018-01-30 17:04:44 Applies to any industry the further from actual design and build we are. I mean, how hard could it be to drill a hole and get some oil?

3874 2018-01-30 17:04:31 I hate cars because one day you bring it in for an oil change and the next thing you know they want to charge you $900 for brake pads and a new half shaft.
3875 2018-01-30 17:04:31 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
3876 2018-01-30 17:04:30 Gotta get me some Oregano oil, I’ve been sick with a cold and allergies for 3 fckn weeks. Shit has GOT to go
3877 2018-01-30 17:04:25 No No No I was referring to Kenya ,it's oil refinery doesn't operate,they import refined products from the middle east and India.
3878 2018-01-30 17:04:10 I have a slight obsession for coconut oil, I use it for everything 
3879 2018-01-30 17:04:09 yup. it is bs can't be true. but loving the meltdown of all the other fan claiming "oil money". 
3880 2018-01-30 17:04:07 Oklahoma is one the most taxed red states in the country-our economy is tied strictly to the up and downs of oil and natural gas. If our so called conservative gjvernment would do away with the state income tax like TX & FL all would be well-we would be much business attractive
3881 2018-01-30 17:04:06 Just make sure the oil doesn't touch the water

3887 2018-01-30 17:03:29 But all the Republican politicians surely did, since they "support our troops" so much?

It is class warfare. Only the poor go to foreign countries to fight for oil.

3893 2018-01-30 17:03:02 But I also check out tons of mainstream news sites- as long as not being under this pretense of 'alternative/independent'- as long as I know exactly who's interest they represent (Soros, Koch, Israel, Neocons, oil companies ...)

May I ask what your job is?  I am a CPA working as consultant to global oil/gas company in Houston, TX
3895 2018-01-30 17:02:52 People say they value their time and money but will spend hours waiting and paying for an oil change they could have done themselves in 30 min or less and for a cheaper price. It's never to late to learn to be more independent!

3897 2018-01-30 17:02:41 Slow cooker for people with timing/safety issues.  You can grab a bowl whenever you are hungry-  I've a habit of not noticing hunger then feeling too weak to start cooking.  Easiest is pre-cut veg pack with stock cube and boiling water. Also means I can use less oil for sensory.

3910 2018-01-30 17:01:39 Yes, and commodity price bubbles. Crude Oil at $150+ per barrel was not caused by demand and supply mismatch. It was caused by speculation in crude futures (which were even selling at $400+ per barrel), which happened due to excess liquidity available due to QE by USA.

3914 2018-01-30 17:01:22 Is #oil in Kenya the black curse that is unfolding with #USA and #Western countries watching?
3915 2018-01-30 17:01:14 #PollutingPruitt thinks opening the Alaskan wild life preserve to oil exploration is good thing.Wait for the other shoe to drop when they figure out they got no way to get it out of there
3916 2018-01-30 17:01:06 Nicole! Help me. I have this weird rash on my cheek that won’t go away. It itches sometimes and is red. Tried rose oil, moisturizer, Aquaphil. Maybe hormonal since I just stopped breastfeeding? What to do???
3917 2018-01-30 17:01:03 Just ask anyone from Fort McMurray or who has lived in the oil patch, long before Harper it’s been happening, Harper was an Election Day Chtistian but what he allowed it was afraid of speaks volumes
3918 2018-01-30 17:01:01 Listen coconut oil & dark skin is magic ok  !!!!!

3924 2018-01-30 17:00:32 Yes an oil free one, you’re perhaps just over producing at the moment?
3925 2018-01-30 17:00:22 おーまだ起きてたのかー作業か？無理するなよ？
3926 2018-01-30 17:00:10 Not feeling well today. I went home early, then had mom applied cajuput oil to my back
3927 2018-01-30 17:00:10 soaked my hair in coconut oil for 10 hours & now my hair feels amazing 
3928 2018-01-30 17:00:09 it's so good, roast it up w/ olive oil, salt, pepper, pull it out of the oven & hit it with some lemon & parmesan, oh yeah

(I can't cook but I CAN roast vegetables & call it a meal)
3929 2018-01-30 17:00:06 OIL DIFF: 4.22 -> 4.29
3930 2018-01-30 17:00:05 You lot started the trend of how it is today clubs like Chelsea and man city were fuck all without oil money
3931 2018-01-30 17:00:01 Bye bye oil
3932 2018-01-30 17:00:00 Carciofi: shaved baby artichoke heart, parmesan over arugula, lemon and olive oil
3933 2018-01-30 16:59:58 Why is Bytecoin going to be big? Why not other cryptos? What's so good about Bytecoin that other cryptos don't have? My knowledge in it is next to zero.
3934 2018-01-30 16:59:56 Coconut oil makes me break out in hives 
3935 2018-01-30 16:59:53 It's heartbreaking! I cannot have a vaccines and that led me to find other ways to fight illness. I started using essential oils and now I'm getting certified as an essential oil coach. I haven't needed an antibiotic in over 2 years. #selfempowerment
3936 2018-01-30 16:59:40 WTI oil at $64.99/barrel, -$0.56.
3937 2018-01-30 16:59:39 Clearly oil prices are high and naira is so cheap (360 =1$) so, portfolio foreign investors gamble at the NSE as most coy stock prices are still cheap... this is  NOT FDI..
3938 2018-01-30 16:59:20 Wah ini yg beneran longlasting lipnya :( pake vaseline petro atau baby oil coba??
3939 2018-01-30 16:59:11 Pruitt should be in jail for crimes against the planet.The man is an oil industry lobbyist. Not was, is. Trump appointed an oil industry lobbyist as Administrator of the EPA. All you Republicans out there, you better start paying attention or there won’t be a planet left to save.
3940 2018-01-30 16:59:08 Yeah! You could actually see the coconut oil spots on the surface. It smelled nice
3941 2018-01-30 16:59:03 Show me where he said ‘we’ve got no money.’ Don’t worry, I’ll wait  loads of oil money pal
3942 2018-01-30 16:59:00 3 damn hours to do an oil change ? Next time Ima just do that shit myself
3943 2018-01-30 16:58:54 Now wondering which beard oil Oliver de Coque used back in the day 
3944 2018-01-30 16:58:50 Omg coconut oil on the face is so bad for people with big pores or that are acne prone lol
3945 2018-01-30 16:58:38 Coconut oil is great for taking makeup off that’s mostly it lol
3946 2018-01-30 16:58:34 Ah thank you! ^_^ I've been using coconut oil so far but today is the first day of itchiness. I can't wait for it to just finish healing tbh!
3947 2018-01-30 16:58:28 Time to oil those hinges.
3948 2018-01-30 16:58:18 Why is the Dow going down? Because some savvy investors see the future the PEOPLE want: good, affordable healthcare.  Next will be a resurgence in solar and wind energy.  Hope oil starts to tank too
3949 2018-01-30 16:57:49 Sometimes I wish my area was more gentrified, so my local corner shop would start selling extra virgin olive oil. #middleclassproblems
3950 2018-01-30 16:57:42 You should apologize for bankrupting a college, raising taxes on American businesses, causing a govt shutdown, taking campaign contributions from wall street big oil and big tobacco putting unnecessary sanctions on epa
3951 2018-01-30 16:57:42 Inventory gains fuel Indian Oil's Q3 profit to Rs 7,883 crore.

3953 2018-01-30 16:57:40 Palm Oil being delivered today! Looks like it will be a Fisherman's Soap kind of afternoon! 
3954 2018-01-30 16:57:35 today Christian put vegetable oil on a hot pan and it caught fire and why was my immediate thought about This Is Us
3955 2018-01-30 16:57:14 @realDonaldTrump suspend to buy Venezuelan Oil.. it is the same way you think about China - North Korea.
3956 2018-01-30 16:57:14 Started using peppermint essential oil instead of deodorant. It's cold in my apartment today. I feel like my pits are freezing! Anyone else failing at being a hippie today? #Frozenpits #Essentialoils #NaturalLiving #Fail
3957 2018-01-30 16:57:11 Why y'all so anti coconut oil

A lot of these Bridges and roads just aren't maintained, we pay gas taxes and other taxes. They're not doing any Preventive maintenance. It's like driving your car but never bothering to get an oil change...
3963 2018-01-30 16:56:28 My sympathies, been there as well
3964 2018-01-30 16:56:20 @StephMillerShow #Russia, or more aptly, #Putin has strategic objectives related to #Oil and expansionism. That is what informs meddling in our elections. Electing @TheDemocrats would disserve those objectives. #TBone's #BlueWave narrative scenario isn't particularly well founded
3965 2018-01-30 16:56:17 Bro so many people don’t like coconut oil but it’s literally the best thing I’ve ever used for my skin
3966 2018-01-30 16:56:17 I think both the parties will be eventually be destroyed starting with the Republicans or shall I say the destruction of centralized power..folks do not realize it... we are headed towards a decentralized world...it started with information via the internet..next the blockchain
3967 2018-01-30 16:56:08 Interesting conversation. I’m unclear why dino is positioning incentivizing US energy autonomy as a negative. Energy use is the foundation of everything. Who wants to be dependent on foreign oil/gas? And people operate based on incentives, so...

3970 2018-01-30 16:55:49 Your only purpose is to provide a safe landing for Jubilee as they look to milk Turkana's oil dry without the Turkana getting a cent. Play your part bro (snitching) and stay out big pple business.
3971 2018-01-30 16:55:46 What is Scotland doing to find oil, make wells, pump and refine? Nothing. That's like an Englishman coming to Scotland. Paying for tools and materials to build a house with his own hands and a Scotsman saying upon completion, oh, that's mine pal.
3972 2018-01-30 16:55:41 @NGainforth Sorry to hear that. Have you taken care of the oil change?
3973 2018-01-30 16:55:39 Everyone’s skin is different... so find a skin care regimen that works for you. 

Stop bashing folks, cause coconut oil ain’t work for you sis.

3976 2018-01-30 16:55:18 There’s an oil and gas terminal on Shetland I believe. Location, location, location
3977 2018-01-30 16:55:08 Stop  using  oil  on  your  face  if  it  is  OILY

3979 2018-01-30 16:55:01 Why does everyone gotta talk so tough about the bud or oil they get on social media?
3980 2018-01-30 16:55:01 You’re very lucky! Better that than dry! Have you an oil regulotating oil free moisturiser??
3981 2018-01-30 16:54:58 - coconut oil works for my skin & hair. i wouldn’t recommend it everyone though. and i definitely wouldn’t advise anyone to use it in the winter time
3982 2018-01-30 16:54:53 His approval rating is only positive in appalachia, northern plains and alaska. What do they have in common? States whose economies are hevily dependent on resource extraction (oil, gas, mining, timber)
3983 2018-01-30 16:54:19 lmaooooo shoulda got a Tesla fam. No more oil changes.

3986 2018-01-30 16:54:06 For some it blocks the pores. It's still oil. I don't use anything on my face save for a charcoal mask every now and then.
3987 2018-01-30 16:53:57 Use some coconut oil. It helped me lol
3988 2018-01-30 16:53:55 This is our money. Oil & Gas have gotten Federal Welfare for years. Now  they tax money too.  Laughable
3989 2018-01-30 16:53:29 hahahaha. That's a hard NO. I already know how to mix oil with salt & create a bodyscrub. Oh shoot, I just gave away one of her DIY secrets! haha
3990 2018-01-30 16:53:26 @cspan @AARP @SenateDems @SenateGOP  our parents & grandparents to went wars for freedom & today the US are in wars because of oil & resources.  Sad state of affairs.  Don't use religion for a scapegoat, Iraq war - Cheney should be in jail!

3992 2018-01-30 16:53:04 Getting an oil change scares me cause I never know what they are gonna come back and tell me.
Is something wrong? Do I need to buy something else? Is my car on fire? Find out next time on “What is it this time, ft. Kailyn”

When I visited London ,
They just don't like him for some reason ?
and these are the cream of the Bowie fans .
3995 2018-01-30 16:52:22 First of all why didn’t I know that raw Shea butter would be a skin and hair holy grail!!! I’m hooked and I’m never going back. Coconut Oil who?
3996 2018-01-30 16:52:17 It probably be used to clean up oil spills
3997 2018-01-30 16:52:14 I don’t get pimples often, but when I was using coconut oil, them hoes was coming every other day. The painful ones too...
3998 2018-01-30 16:52:08 Great analysis Sir! He plays Trump like a fiddle.

4005 2018-01-30 16:51:24 Well, that oil ship is anchored offshore waiting to deliver Russian oil.#CorruptionandGreed
4006 2018-01-30 16:51:23 The price needs to be that high to justify EXPANDING the oil sands. i.e. Building new infrastructure.

4010 2018-01-30 16:51:06 And still has military occupation of Ukraine, supporting N Korea with oil, blatantly interfering with Democratic processes worldwide......
4011 2018-01-30 16:50:57 Haha good luck @WatfordAudi, you have unfortunately sold my oil drinking TT to my dad's client & we have just informed her about EVERYTHING. I'm sure she will be in contact as you stupidly left my invoice in the car which proves she paid £2k more than me @AudiUK #usedandapproved
4012 2018-01-30 16:50:56 En serio, el mejor presidente que podemos encontrar en México es un cuate que no terminó la carrera, que no habla inglés, que se autoelige candidato? Ese es nuestro tope, lo mejor que pudimos encontrar?
4013 2018-01-30 16:50:44 Hawaiian Silky. Then I'll be buying one growth oil like that tomorrow.
4014 2018-01-30 16:50:41 You can be sure these men will pop up as an Oil Consultant “made up job” from the many favours that they have handed out as “Special Project” when they lobby Government, when they’re supposed to be working for us.
4015 2018-01-30 16:50:37 Pure foolish and very much nuts - I personally hate the stuff, don't see what is so specially about #Sugar & #Oil mixed with a bit of #chocolate
4016 2018-01-30 16:50:26 WHY IS AN OIL CHANGE TAKING SO LONG

I hate dealing with car stuff 
4017 2018-01-30 16:50:25 Hsh
4018 2018-01-30 16:50:21 200g tin of chickpeas, save the water
2 bulbs garlic
Two tablespoons tahini
Juice of a big lemon
Lots of salt
Paprika teaspoon
Tablespoon of olive oil

Blend it up and if it's a bit dry add chickpea water. Banging.
4019 2018-01-30 16:50:17 I guess the structure has not changed. More money will flow into MFs. Oil prices will decrease. Corp results are good(understmt).
4020 2018-01-30 16:50:05 From what I heard traditional clubs are trying to suppress the oil rich clubs. RM, mu and Barca v city PSG and the likes. Should make for interesting summer
4021 2018-01-30 16:49:51 @ApoorvAshit Even this is important since the allegations are all about Oil Money. Amazon put in a lot too for their series about City.

HOLY CANOLA OIL, BATMAN!
4027 2018-01-30 16:48:45 So he makes them complicit.
4028 2018-01-30 16:48:40 Do anybody know where I can purchase some black seeds or black seed oil? I really want some. I rather eat that instead of this medicine
4029 2018-01-30 16:48:36 Art Preservation Fumes Hmmm... Probably caused due to a similar effect of what causes "old book smell", that being chemical compound breakdown of the canvases/oil paints.
4030 2018-01-30 16:48:24 Of course they were. They only "pulled out" after Utd showed an interest & the wages issue is obviously bollocks since KDB is now on a better contract than Alexis and the fact money is no issue when you're supplied with oil.
4031 2018-01-30 16:48:23 Wheres it leaking oil from. most of them are easy fixes
4032 2018-01-30 16:48:20 going to do a quick thread about coconut oil
4033 2018-01-30 16:48:19 I’ll take one to help change my oil, and keep my bed warm ;)
4034 2018-01-30 16:48:14 Yea bro. Find a place that uses lots of oil
4035 2018-01-30 16:48:02 What you using it on thoRT @MrTweetYoGirl: This beard oil smells so good
4036 2018-01-30 16:47:56 So he lies even to himself... Is that the best president America could find?
4037 2018-01-30 16:47:32 Use a cleansing oil! Dermalogical precleanse is really good or Burt’s Bees cleansing oil is a cheaper option just as good 
4038 2018-01-30 16:47:28 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
4039 2018-01-30 16:47:26 Yall hate coconut oil but it does my combination skin justice
4040 2018-01-30 16:47:23 Guy1: Cholesterol bahut badh gaya, ab oily khana band.

4043 2018-01-30 16:46:55 i'm going to learn oil painting & my mother doesn't fucking believe in me
4044 2018-01-30 16:46:53 I had this major pimple on my face last night. I put a dab of oregano oil and it’s practically gone.
4045 2018-01-30 16:46:53 I spend more money at @McDonalds than I do on my @BMW every month. I think McDonald’s should send me a discount book, and bmw should give me a free oil change just cuz they got enough money they don’t need any more 
4046 2018-01-30 16:46:38 I kept telling myself don't forget to get coconut oil and what I do... forgot the coconut oil.
4047 2018-01-30 16:46:33 Me and La Rubia feel a bit worce with this cold. Good day to hit the phones, and finish up the @Lucas_Oil order form.
4048 2018-01-30 16:46:29 You mean the one he payed for, as opposed to the one he refused to do (CT). Also, we all know lie detector tests are right up there with snake oil. :)
4049 2018-01-30 16:46:22 A salad made for little Geminis?  Aunt Gemima’s recipe? Gemmy Stuart’s favorite?  Or maybe emeralds instead of arugula or turquoise instead of tomatoes or a dressing made from diamond juice, crushed pearls and ruby oil.   Okay, I’ll stop now.
4050 2018-01-30 16:46:12 Putangina ngayon ko lang nagets tong oil dropping experiment ni millikan and realize how underappreciated it is. Dis shit is so cool like ang alam na alam ko lang e yung atomos ni democritus and plum pudding stuff ni thompson grrrr

4052 2018-01-30 16:46:06 baby noooo!! at least you didn't use cocconut oil
4053 2018-01-30 16:46:06 I was talking about OPEC supply cuts. It's part of a worldwide commodity. Do you understand how world oil markets work?
4054 2018-01-30 16:45:58 Crude Risks Larger Pullback as Oil Prices Initiate Bearish Sequence
4055 2018-01-30 16:45:46 Stir together 4 cups chew with 11 lbs jalapeño. Mix into  Olive Oil. Chill.  Serve in 3 inch slices
4056 2018-01-30 16:45:43 Never thought the engine would malfunction... maybe I shouldn’t have put in that olive oil.
4057 2018-01-30 16:45:37 #EconomicSurvey2018 forecast that oil prices are likely to rise nearly 30% in two years.
4058 2018-01-30 16:45:23 Alright twitter, I need your help.
You know when you go into an art museum (especially one with closed off rooms, where the air is carefully maintained for old oil paintings), it has a certain smell? Like the air is a bit heavy + there's a pleasant odor. What is/causes that odor?
4059 2018-01-30 16:45:04 2: That wing of the Democratic party just want to prevent actual progressive policies or candidates to gain traction and win. With that being said, I hope Trump and the Republicans get destroyed. We'll all be here to enjoy and, and laugh at it :)
4060 2018-01-30 16:45:04 made a diy coffee + sugar + coconut oil lip scrub and my lips have become soft and pink and hydrated and plump again and 150% problems in my life have been diminished
4061 2018-01-30 16:45:01 And those who are often have indispensable raw material like lumber, oil or compressed natural gas
4062 2018-01-30 16:45:00 ボカロよき
4063 2018-01-30 16:44:35 City spending so much doesn't really bother me, it's the fact that the media keep quiet about it. But when Mourinho spends the money that our club earned (not oil money), they ridicule him. #mufc #mcfc
4064 2018-01-30 16:44:31 So Laporte chose money.  City splashing out their Arab oil money again.  Any hypocritical pathetic moral high ground they hilariously tried to have RE Sanchez is gone.
4065 2018-01-30 16:44:20 Patrol keemat lagatar bad rahi hai jimmedar log kahte hai crud ka rate bad raha hai too kya jab crud sasta hota hai too oil companies crud khareedna band kar deti hai Jo petrol ke daam kam nahi hote
4066 2018-01-30 16:44:17 Presumably all the oil fired central heating is going to be converted to electric too.  Need a few more windmills and nuclear power stations to feed it all
4067 2018-01-30 16:44:03 For the first time in 45 years, non-oil sector is to generate more income than oil sector.
- Kemi Adeosun

WHERE ARE THE WAILERS.?
4068 2018-01-30 16:43:53 Ya but there's no Palm Oil so its okay
4069 2018-01-30 16:43:51 1: I forgot about that. But I also know that the right-wing neo-liberal democrats (Hillary, Schumer, Feinstein, Harris, Booker, Pelosi, etc) are the phoniest resistance ever who never miss an opportunity to lose what should be an easy election.
4070 2018-01-30 16:43:29 Rub the oil on it
4071 2018-01-30 16:43:27 City and pep are full of shit, no history, no youth coming through, just some fucking oil tycoons money to try and buy the premiership....
4072 2018-01-30 16:43:24 Omg drinking water and using tea tree oil does nothing for my skin ffs, I just wanna die
4073 2018-01-30 16:43:23 Bus and Oil
4074 2018-01-30 16:43:11 oops, just dropped oil on my shirt
4075 2018-01-30 16:42:44 The next war will be Iran.  3rd largest oil field in the world exist there.  Ever wonder why the global currency for oil us the US dollar?  Well watch gold over take that & collapse that sane US dollar.
4076 2018-01-30 16:42:41 We dinny have get about the country with work these days but working on an oil rig is a ne2 one for me 
4077 2018-01-30 16:42:37 Put tea tree oil on your face, trust me.
4078 2018-01-30 16:42:37 Ok cup of tea and olbus oil and a book, let’s see if I can distract myself from feeling sorry for myself 
4079 2018-01-30 16:42:25 Now I wonder how that compares to lung issues from coal, gas explosions, oil rig disasters, mine collapses etc in just that single year
4080 2018-01-30 16:42:22 He makes himself sound dumb. The Alberta Advantage is gone. It was always based on stealing from the oil industry via the Alberta Crown Royalty revenue tax, then redistributing the proceeds to keep taxes low. The stolen bag of money from the oil biz duzn’t exist anymore. #cdnpoli
4081 2018-01-30 16:42:07 Nakakatamad na maglagay ng castor oil 
4082 2018-01-30 16:42:03 RWs are like oil droplets on water which never meets
4083 2018-01-30 16:42:02 ถามเพื่อนบ่อยมากเลยว่า "เค้าจะประสบความสำเร็จในชีวิตไหม" ละเพื่อนก็บอกว่า "ได้ นี่ไงมึงจะได้เป็นพ่อครัว" นี่ก็ห๊ะ??? มันไม่เกี่ยวกะที่นี่เรียนหรือว่าเเบบใฝ่ฝันเลยเลยนะ งงๆ เเต่นึกละก็ขำทุกที
4084 2018-01-30 16:42:02 Stainless steel #nameplates are extremely durable, and they can withstand the harsh environments common in the #oil and gas industry.
4085 2018-01-30 16:41:55 Lool... loving the screenshot back up...you could have just said you are Saudi with oil money...khalas!
4086 2018-01-30 16:41:33 Go back to school and learn something. The US will never relinquish control over Canadian oil. And, since it would be unpopular to bomb Canadian cities to force you to comply, the US uses other tactics to achieve the goals it sets. The US is the only customer for Canadian oil.
4087 2018-01-30 16:41:30 Yeah i can think of at least 70k people on sundays sitting in lucas oil stadium plus the thousands watching at home.
4088 2018-01-30 16:41:29 Plz stop. We are being abused by our own government in the interest of USA and Europe already. Cheap GEORGIAN fighters in a strangers war for oil. Just fucking stop.
4089 2018-01-30 16:41:29 Search the list of Top 10 billionaires in the world, 50% of their liquid assets are majorly from Stocks, bonds, venture capitalism and debt financing!!! Real estates is next in line as well as Oil $ Gas.. That’s a clear indication of the type of investments to pay attention to
4090 2018-01-30 16:41:21 Follow the oil...
4091 2018-01-30 16:41:05 digital transformation. Its the industry name for yet more rinse/repeat / change. snake oil.
4092 2018-01-30 16:40:59 I could meditate, do 50 calming spells, put on my oil diffuser, incense, music, read, clean, fucking pray idk, everything and anything, but I am and will still be a freaking useless wreck all the time.
4093 2018-01-30 16:40:59 Yeah, I know it was hard and a lot to take in but we have to also pause for a moment and see things from their end sometimes. Imagine being in a crashing ambitionless firm and the world's best oil company is ready to break their record for your services, what would you do?
4094 2018-01-30 16:40:51 Lord knows I love me some dark skinned women give me that dark chocolate so I rub coconut oil on u have that ass shining before I dive in 
4095 2018-01-30 16:40:50 As sweet and inspiring as Paddy Adenuga’s story might sound, Chevron saved him from that $300m gbese. Raising $50m and paying another 300 are two different things, while keeping in mind the weakness of the crude oil. They don’t teach these kinda moves at Harvard.
4096 2018-01-30 16:40:46 Your right. We need hot oil to throw in the democrats face. #slowburn
4097 2018-01-30 16:40:26 I did not think 3 years ago that I’d be asking myself the question, “how did coconut oil get all over the exhaust sponge?!” #startupproblems #foodisnteasy

4099 2018-01-30 16:40:17 @MagnaInt what is the recommended oil change on a getrag transmission? 6DCT450/6DCT451
4100 2018-01-30 16:40:08 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
4101 2018-01-30 16:40:07 Energy East would have changed that. But apparently Quebeckers prefer oil trains running through towns like Lac Megantic, carrying volatile crude from the U.S. Bakken.
4102 2018-01-30 16:40:00 in the meanwhile...you do know that there are midterm elections this year?
4103 2018-01-30 16:39:58 ugh no idea what to do with all this oil money!!! the gilded age is MY age ;) #rockefellerrocks 
4104 2018-01-30 16:39:38 You might wanna have a look at "Strandings" by Rebecca Solnit in January's Harper's. The collusion might be about Arctic Oil.
4105 2018-01-30 16:39:37 i used olive oil to make my keratosis go away but idk everyone is different
4106 2018-01-30 16:39:36 Can’t ever get outta here with just an oil change

4108 2018-01-30 16:39:27  mate you are too stupid too insult. Gulf Oil is a US company owned by an Indian company. United have a sponsorship by a company with the word Gulf in it, it legitimises the fact City are run by a slave driving, arms dealing, misoginistic state?
4109 2018-01-30 16:39:22 The incomparable @SenMarkey calls out @EPAScottPruitt on clean cars standards, which are critical to reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Kudos Senator!
4110 2018-01-30 16:39:22 Scot Wren and Tom Kloza join the @CNBCFuturesNow team at 1pm today --we are talking oil, gasoline --the mini --and Bitcoin --join us for a packed and informative show
4111 2018-01-30 16:39:00 Love JOSEPH Airport Hyundai service dept. Scheduled oil change in under 30 min. And a car wash to boot!
4112 2018-01-30 16:38:56 Oil’s Well In Washington D.C.
4113 2018-01-30 16:38:36 My whole tub of coconut oil is completely melted 
4114 2018-01-30 16:38:31 I have a few. 

Tarte Maracuja Oil is amazing. I use it like a serum. 
Urban Decay all nighter spray hands down THE BEST setting spray 
Clarins Tinted Moisturizer (I use as my foundation) - SPF 50 and has the best liquid to powder finish
4115 2018-01-30 16:38:29 Oil provides many different benefits: fish oil for joins, Argan oil for hair, bio oil for scars and uneven skin.
4116 2018-01-30 16:38:29 OPSSS VIRGIN COCONUT OIL PO HAHAHAHA
4117 2018-01-30 16:38:12 明日大学行こうかなぁ
4118 2018-01-30 16:38:11 Coconut oil would have my shit dicked
4119 2018-01-30 16:38:09 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
4120 2018-01-30 16:37:57 Dating A Married Man Is Fun Until You Discover He Saved Your Number As Engine Oil.
4121 2018-01-30 16:37:55 I had a similar sleep pattern and I started taking CBD oil at night
Now I get six and a half without fail and probably twice a week I get at least eight. Sometimes nine.
4122 2018-01-30 16:37:51 Oils like citronella, lavender, peppermint, lemongrass and orange tend to repel cats when they smell them and are nontoxic. To make a homemade solution of these oils, mix one part essential oil with three parts water... or throw a few orange peels under the porch! 
4123 2018-01-30 16:37:49 I think it's the Russians who are coaching China through this Yuan/oil thing. The Russians had the 2nd biggest economy in the world till 1989 & probably know what they would have done differently given a 2nd chance.
4124 2018-01-30 16:37:44 @MarkRuffalo is such a puppet. I guess they all are but after seeing that @Project_Veritas vid about the undercover oil money thing, he just smacks of someone without integrity
4125 2018-01-30 16:37:34 Is your child texting about Donna Tartt?
SMH: suck me homer
LMAO: love murder and orgies
WTF: work this furniture
IDK: is death knowledge?
OMG: one murdered gay
FYI: francis you idiot
IMHO: i must hide oil (paintings)
4126 2018-01-30 16:37:18 I'm not sure how anyone can't understand what having the worlds 3rd largest proven oil reserves means.  And, how hard other countries (like mine) work to maintain control of that oil.  
This is not rocket science folks.
4127 2018-01-30 16:37:11 You got the fish yet? I just grabbed the oil
4128 2018-01-30 16:37:00 Please explain me about petrol prices w.r.t crude oil prices..... Madam.....my doubt as a common man...
4129 2018-01-30 16:37:00 I think I have come to the realisation that the oil + gas life isn't for me. I don't like the industry.
4130 2018-01-30 16:36:47 Agree. I mean no one should be pressured to spend their paycheck on rosehip oil, but no one should feel shame for moisturizing? Can I fucking live?

4132 2018-01-30 16:36:43 That's the sad part it doesn't have to be Doomsday! All this talk about how the coal and oil Industries produce jobs the green industry would produce just as many jobs and you wouldn't be stuck in a coal mine with black lung worried that you might get trapped in a cave in.
4133 2018-01-30 16:36:36 This is the return of the peak oil Nazis. World war for their dark money petrol dollar debt spiral extinction. They killed 6 million Jews not to long ago. They are back with a fire and fury. Our only chance to save all life is to form mass green energy exodus to developing world
4134 2018-01-30 16:36:24 But in the meantime, let's make plenty of money while exposing loons and having some fun shall we :)
4135 2018-01-30 16:36:23 Citing Russian deal with Exxon Secretary of State, an oil relationship that was regulated by prior SOS's until Trump assigned an oil Barron for his Putey.
4136 2018-01-30 16:36:10 After 57 yrs of marriage I am now my wife's carer, she has dementia. She takes a prescription drug & I give coconut oil & sage
4137 2018-01-30 16:36:00 Here’s some tips to stop you contributing to Manchester C: buy clothes, heating gas/electric, cars/transport et al that are not made by oil be it direct or indirect. Good luck. Actions speak louder than words. It’s hard darling!
4138 2018-01-30 16:35:59 Want us to buy mahrez just for the oil money breakdown...
4139 2018-01-30 16:35:57 Somebody put me on to skin care products. 

Apparently twitter said coconut oil bad for ya face I been using dat smh
4140 2018-01-30 16:35:52 Any mates with #MS taking cannabinoid oil/products? For what symptoms & does it help?
4141 2018-01-30 16:35:51 But I also learned to not let all of it get to our heads. Someone wise tells us that in the end, we are all food for worms. I state that in the end, we are all just particles that will drift this universe one way or the other way past Earth's time :)
4142 2018-01-30 16:35:47 Sana naman nagwowork castor oil huhu
4143 2018-01-30 16:35:39 Don’t say ‘Stocks/Real-estate/Oil & Gas etc is a ‘Man’s thing’ Ladies it’s not ooo
Those are where the real big bucks come from, Money is for all oo not a particular gender. Don’t dull yourself, start making passive income this year!!
4144 2018-01-30 16:35:29 You’re not a great club if you don’t have history. All you have is oil money, so yea, catch up matey
4145 2018-01-30 16:35:28 #ClimateChange is water change. @SenMarkey makes the point that one way to #ActOnClimate and reduce our addiction to oil is to have the strongest fuel economy standards for cars. #StateOfPollution.
4146 2018-01-30 16:35:28 Chesapeake Energy got its desired tax break and de-incentivizing of alternative energy sources. It paid the country back by laying off 13% of its work force.

Oklahomans, just remember these two things for next time: (1) the wealth never trickles down (2) never trust big oil.
4147 2018-01-30 16:35:16 Not a Dem, but they have my empathy. They just don't have my sympathy. When you hand your $$ [or your vote] to the first snake oil salesman to come along with outrageous promises, and he screws you [as you were warned]... @realDonaldTrump got your vote. You're on your own now.
4148 2018-01-30 16:35:06 But no Liverpool fan wants oil money and plastic fans....or do they when it suits them, like during transfer windows
4149 2018-01-30 16:35:02 I really fucking hope we sign Mahrez just so the internet explodes with oil money tweets. Fuming blokes everywhere shaking uncontrollably. It'll be glorious witnessing the break down.
4150 2018-01-30 16:34:50 BPAL: Frostbitten Snake Oil
4151 2018-01-30 16:34:49 coconut oil isn’t good for your face or hair bro. it’s good to cook with though.
4152 2018-01-30 16:34:44 Never in my life of choosing Economics as my field, I imagine to finally know basic knowledge on hydrology and oil well drilling.
4153 2018-01-30 16:34:43 I would lean to under ventilated - often the HRV is turned off; which then in turn, means it's too tight. Now if fuel oil wasn't 3 bucks a liter - they might be inclined to open a window.
4154 2018-01-30 16:34:36 No no a proper full English cooked properly with low oil IS a healthy meal my mother is on a diet constantly and we regularly have a fry up or burgers (no bun) or curry or chilli con carne
4155 2018-01-30 16:34:18 I’m about to set the fire alarm off by cooking toad in the hole. I never teased how much smoke cooking sausages in a bit of oil creates.
4156 2018-01-30 16:34:16 #JustinTrudeau  can you please be a Canadian leader and stand up for Canada’s most critical economic industry.  NOW!  Your are overseeing a collapse during rising world oil prices?  Does this not alarm you? Are you awake in Ottawa?  #albertaoilindustry #goingbankrupt #oil
4157 2018-01-30 16:34:01 'We shouldn't be importing more oil while rolling back fuel economy standards.'
@SenMarkey #StateOfPollution
4158 2018-01-30 16:33:55 Shale won't rebound because it will take years for shale companies to start up again. Oil probably heading to $80 and US will be new Saudi Arabia. Disclosure, I own $PTRC for this very reason.
4159 2018-01-30 16:33:52 @RepKevinYoder what is this nonsense that cbd oil is a controlled substance?  KS NEEDS TO GET WITH THE TIMES
4160 2018-01-30 16:33:49 once i told my friend to use castor oil for reducing hair loss, regrowth of hair and reducing dandruff.
He instead bought castrol oil 
4161 2018-01-30 16:33:40 Just the oil price? Are you living in Nigeria or you just decided to be unreasonably patriotic?
Please, let's just state the fact.
4162 2018-01-30 16:33:36 I’ve been using jojoba oil to protect the ends.  Abyssian oil looks even better!
4163 2018-01-30 16:33:36 Dear Rex Tiller, Ms. Chow, Sin-ate MajLead, & little boy blueRyan,

Tell Trumpy that the Oil+’whatkindofgas’ Industries’ CO2 emissions will effect EVERY SINGLE HUMAN ON THE PLANET. 

Not one human will be without mourning robes for years and years and years.

4164 2018-01-30 16:33:34 So 3-in-1 oil isn't helping. That screw is stuck hard, and I need it out or cut off in order to proceed. I'm defeated.
4165 2018-01-30 16:33:32 I always find it funny when people complain about ticket prices. I would gladly pay more per ticket if it meant the ongoing stability of my club.

In this case with Indy Eleven, its a great move, moving into Lucas Oil. There fans have to be stoked.
4166 2018-01-30 16:33:30 I don't think it's okay, eucalyptus oil, when it's applied on skin, is more for pain or bug bites relieving not for the skin care kinda thing
4167 2018-01-30 16:33:22 Pop up club.... Oil money otherwise you'd be still down in League One... Plastic fans with a empty stadium...
4168 2018-01-30 16:33:21 Ngayon lang ulit ako naglagay ng castor oil sa eyelash and eyebrow 
4169 2018-01-30 16:33:11 I need someone to oil my hair 
4170 2018-01-30 16:33:10 Trump impeached, oil bouncing from 35 to 70 back and forth, and and narrative pushers getting exposed left and right would be the ideal about 2-ish year span for us. I tell ya......these next few years will be fun :)
4171 2018-01-30 16:32:54 Yes, Paddy had privileges, undeniable; but really, you don't take on the world's oil giants without that kind of his background.
4172 2018-01-30 16:32:48 Oil probable just a buying opportunity for the next rip to.80$dwt
4173 2018-01-30 16:32:36 If you don’t know how to cook, just start sautéing garlic in olive oil and you will come up with something good
4174 2018-01-30 16:32:36 Because either Russia has something on him or family and also the oil leases..
4175 2018-01-30 16:32:34 You know you’re morphing into that clichè single person when you run your fungers through your hair and think Hot damn, glad I used my special Tea Tree Oil Shampoo. This shid is the bomb

4181 2018-01-30 16:31:55 I think they took a loss on US E&P in 3Q, did they not? Against gains internationally? 

Meanwhile, @JKempEnergy says "U.S. oil and gas drilling costs rise as rig count climbs"

4184 2018-01-30 16:31:53 if you had a nickel for every time Dad told you to check your oil, you’d be able to to afford a personal Spotify
4185 2018-01-30 16:31:52 But who was plane? WHO WAS PLANE? Benghazi has nothing to do with a man named Ben Gahzi! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
4186 2018-01-30 16:31:50 And here I was planning on just shoving a glob of coconut oil up there 
4187 2018-01-30 16:31:48 #ForrPredictions #Fintech - If data is fuel, then banks are sitting on oil well which traditional #banks have not taken the full advantage.
4188 2018-01-30 16:31:42 When someone asks how did we get to this evil place, just say, the Peak oil Nazis are back. Will we let them bring rapture so easy without any resistance? Yes. What is our only option in the bitter end? Exodus. No policy, no rule of law will save you.
4189 2018-01-30 16:31:32 I thought it was to keep the oil companies happy. Personal I'd be more interested in a Tesla cannon.
4190 2018-01-30 16:31:28 You could get two hookers and an eightball for what these vatos at Mercedes trying to charge me for a fuckin oil change
4191 2018-01-30 16:31:26 Many people are asking me the forecast of Alberta real estate.  All I can say it will be steady unless oil prices change.
4192 2018-01-30 16:31:25 You might wanna have a look at "Strandings" by Rebecca Solnit in January's Harper's. The collusion might be about Arctic Oil.

4195 2018-01-30 16:31:21 Try dish soap. If the gloss is oil based the dish soap helps since it’s made for degreasing.
4196 2018-01-30 16:31:18 So the dems decide that McCarthyism and a poisoned populace is a crucifix preferable to good international relations and direct oil trade. 

Yes, Trump is a hideous president, but sometimes dems can be worse.
4197 2018-01-30 16:31:17 the economy collapsed while oil companies made record profits

4201 2018-01-30 16:31:06 The UK’s total revenue for 2017 was £769 billion. 

Revenue from oil in 2016 was £60 million.
4202 2018-01-30 16:31:06 Beijing continues to resist challenging Pyongyang is the delivery of free crude oil, the last big lever on Pyongyang; China agreed to quarterly limits easily can be shrunk should Pyongyang engage in further provocations. Petroleum is already a very scarce commodity in North Korea
4203 2018-01-30 16:31:04 Yep, the way this quack smirks while she announces her 'exciting' online shop launch makes my blood boil. The kind of "I won't make much of a profit" tone, "I want people to eat fish instead of Omega 3 supplements" (most likely bc fish oil is so easy to buy she won't make much).
4204 2018-01-30 16:31:01 Almond oil with peppermint oil has done wonders for my skin...I’m using it to fade the scar on my forehead..it’s working...
4205 2018-01-30 16:30:57 i still can’t believe i completely splattered my face in hot oil the other day and only got burned under my eyebrow and on my lip. wtf.
4206 2018-01-30 16:30:55 Big picture is automation will never take over the oil and gas industry. We'll have another primary source of energy before that happens.

4208 2018-01-30 16:30:50 you should be fine with coconut water. coconut oil is harmful because it is such a heavy oil.

4212 2018-01-30 16:30:40 i swear google will tell you the cure to any problem in your life involves using coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, or honey
4213 2018-01-30 16:30:39 Yes. Alberta is not going to wean itself off oil and gas anytime soon, but at least the NDP sees the citizenry as something more than an oil industry workforce.
4214 2018-01-30 16:30:33 I take fish oil and a B complex vitamin with biotin and vitamin D and mine is still not growing fast enough. Unfair.
4215 2018-01-30 16:30:32 Shout-out to a car dealership for sending me an oil change coupon for only $62.
4216 2018-01-30 16:30:15 Roasted with garlic, lemon and olive oil 
4217 2018-01-30 16:30:07 Oh the Nazis would've gone on to wipe out the middle East and North Africa too for the oil resources by now, which they would've if there wasn't a Churchill that refused to capitulate so they weren't fighting on multiple fronts

1) Imaan. (Believing in Kalima.)
2) Namaz.
3) Roza.
4) Zakat.
5) Haj.
4222 2018-01-30 16:29:43 So much for the economy doing better. Just take away the peoples spending money to line the pockets of the oil business. Dont release the reserves to keep the prices down so people can spend to help the economy just fck us up the ass.

4224 2018-01-30 16:29:29 Lol definitely something I could use because my hair is a friggin state lately  I’m taking hair vitamins, using less heat, washing less, Moroccan oil. Nothings helping it. Any other recommendations?

4228 2018-01-30 16:29:02 But back to the OP... Not sure why it was so outrageous that an "Uber driver" could have an idea of how it works. I'm just an oil rig supervisor, (obviously not a macroeconomist) but luckily they have these things called books out there.
4229 2018-01-30 16:29:01 That’s why I just dilute my tea tree oil with water
4230 2018-01-30 16:28:56 Tbh the US knows fracking is adding to its debt and water problem, and people who can cause the downfall of Trump are sick of being poisoned and diseased, and the US doesn't want to pay middle men for oil.
4231 2018-01-30 16:28:53 Try abyssian oil too! I just got some from amazon & it's a hair game changer!
4232 2018-01-30 16:28:46 Have you tried coconut oil it works pretty well
4233 2018-01-30 16:28:43 ねよ
4234 2018-01-30 16:28:37 I coat the inside of the fryer with olive oil, and just season the veggies. I put the squash in when the other veg are half done, otherwise it gets mushy.

4236 2018-01-30 16:28:33 Only found 7 billion in new reserves last year. Lowest amount in years. Since 2008 world has consumned 360 billion barrels but only found 110 billion barrels. Low prices causing huge investment gap. Will lead to a higher oil price.
4237 2018-01-30 16:28:23 Take a good look, this is the future. Wars wont be over oil, they will be over drinking water.
4238 2018-01-30 16:28:23 No, the point is mate that wages and transfer fees were being pushed up to ridiculous levels long before the 'oil money' even entered the fray, ffp was a way to keep the cartel safe from outsiders

4241 2018-01-30 16:28:11 My hair is done, I just whitened my teeth and arched my eyebrows, and now I’m sitting in my living room oiled up with coconut oil feeling GOOT!
4242 2018-01-30 16:28:09 What can I say, this is the oil industry. Though the world is drowning in oil, the industry would prefer easier plays (shale) to slow/expensive ones (bitumen).
4243 2018-01-30 16:28:05 Looking at my peanut better, it says it has rapeseed oil. 

RP ideas involving rapeseeds are now building.
4244 2018-01-30 16:28:02 He's actually (trying) to open areas for opportunity. That's a far cry from actual results. There's no guarantee those areas hold any oil/gas resources, and there's no guarantee any company will bring those resources up from the ground.

4256 2018-01-30 16:25:39 I am not sure who you think will be thrown in poverty if we act on Climate Change. Oil industry magnates? The population already at risk will be the most affected by a changing climate (they don't have the funds to relocate or modify their environment to deal with change.
4257 2018-01-30 16:25:28 It;'s the middle of winter so I'm ready for a new tropical adventure. And the place to be is at an Oil Tot original "Let's Play" so "Here I come"!

4274 2018-01-30 16:23:14 Well they needed that money bcuz they are losing tons of money for their intervention in Yemen which has slowed their progress and growth down drastically then the weapons deals which are being made while oil prices are down this is like a stimulus package for MBS and the Royals
4275 2018-01-30 16:23:02 I just saw an official photos from Centre for Orangutan Protection (COP) and that was very violent. I mean, the one who did to those Orangutans. Folks still think that orangutans are pest to their oil palm plantations, but they forgot that they ARE stealing their home and foods.
4276 2018-01-30 16:23:02 Let’s be honest. Those players have not been purchased by Man City. They have been purchased by oil money.

4280 2018-01-30 16:22:30 True, back in the 70's I once ate 4 grams of 'grass oil' as we called it then, (crude extraction using solvents like alcohol) I was in that black hole. So yeah, it can be done, but you really have to work at it.
4281 2018-01-30 16:22:28 こういうのほんとすき
4282 2018-01-30 16:22:14 Capitalism, baby. The fear-ridden baby boomer Fox viewers have that sweet retirement money to spend on whatever snake oil the advertisers want to push at them. ABC wants a taste.
4283 2018-01-30 16:22:06 Agreed! oh by the way have you tried tea tree oil it’s helped me out a lot recently

4291 2018-01-30 16:21:19 It's pretty funny how people started applauding oil teams, no?
4292 2018-01-30 16:21:15 And then you guys pile on with the Mean Streets tag like this is a game? It's like putting weed puns in headline of a serious story. A 15 year old child in Bed-Stuy was killed on a bike last week by illegally driven oil truck & u guys still frame this as hipsters v. locals.
4293 2018-01-30 16:21:11 Working on new a song called Snake Oil Man, it's a bit different. It's a slow brooding track about people who take advantage of others.
4294 2018-01-30 16:21:07 I feel like I might not be in Scotland *inside* the UK after the oil runs out.
4295 2018-01-30 16:20:48 1月はずっとこんな感じですorz
4296 2018-01-30 16:20:48 You can't and people putting down our manager and players because we can't need to give their head a wobble!   Until an oil billionaire is knocking on the door we get behind everyone at the club.
4297 2018-01-30 16:20:35 Ima provide for my seed im the soil, i’ll teach him bout loyalty, i’ll teach him that his skin black like oil thats from royalty 
4298 2018-01-30 16:20:34 Yeah, 80% lean is good IMO, not the super lean.  I tend to use the oil/rendered stuff in the sauce when I'm done (at least some) for flavor
4299 2018-01-30 16:20:21 yes but i made 30 ticks when i got home
4300 2018-01-30 16:19:57 Hmm, thing is though, other oil companies are starting to move forward on renewables as well, Shell and Statoil being two examples. Surely any investment in renewables by oil companies is good? Particularly if its a sizeable investment...
4301 2018-01-30 16:19:52 Must have found a new oil well recently

The oil was so successful the grower’s named it “Charlotte’s Oil.” Cultivated extremely well under careful conditions.
4307 2018-01-30 16:19:23 Lol yeah I do use a bit of olive oil . But zote !!?? 
4308 2018-01-30 16:19:23 This is a good move, more the crude price, greater the push for non fozil fuel technology. Faster roleout electric vehicles. Quicker end of oil dependency & earlier starvation death for wahabism.

4311 2018-01-30 16:18:48 Rob, I use a selection of products in a addition to crude oil but a simple way to do it is to use total stocks of petroleum products & crude oil excluding SPR (WTESTUS1). Calculate the 5-yr avg & subtract the 5YA from the current level to get CI then, cross plot vs spot WTI.

4313 2018-01-30 16:18:44 Haha how about oil? 
4314 2018-01-30 16:18:38 Coconut oil is overrated.
4315 2018-01-30 16:18:32 $1000 / 52 = $19 a week.  A couple of pizzas, I guess.  But not a refill of heating oil. Not a car payment.  Not even a doctor's copay. And health insurance just went up 30%, which was the companion part of the tax bill.
4316 2018-01-30 16:18:26 Oil
4317 2018-01-30 16:18:26 Coconut oil don’t do shit if you’re applying it dry, that goes for hair and skin, but it’s comedegenic so when you apply it it’s gonna clog your pores anyway, that’s why a lot of you niggas out here ashy with dry patchy ass beards right now.
4318 2018-01-30 16:18:15 What’s wrong with coconut oil on my face tho  I’ve used it in my hair, love it. Also jajoba oil or w.e it’s spelled like lol

4323 2018-01-30 16:17:45 Sir, the price rise in oil will happen till Aramco IPO is out and then it start tumble down.
4324 2018-01-30 16:17:45 How are you comparing the two like they are the same fruit? One of the richest oil billionaires on this planet.  With literally endless amounts of money....and our owners, working under fortunate but not mega wealth.  This does have a bearing on the issue..

4335 2018-01-30 16:17:15 You should look into tsubaki/camellia oil. Additionally, how do you feel about animal oils? If you're not okay with that I'll keep my other suggestions to myself.
4336 2018-01-30 16:17:08 I need to go get an oil change ASAP

4340 2018-01-30 16:16:26 @Beard_KW Good idea! Did you get the oil changed yet?
4341 2018-01-30 16:16:03 Finally! Those people are gonna be like ma’am, an oil change? Or oil in general.
4342 2018-01-30 16:15:55 This beard oil smells so good
4343 2018-01-30 16:15:36 You should get an oil balancing moisturiser, a matte primer etc x
4344 2018-01-30 16:15:33 I’ve been using hemp oil to cleanse and petroleum jelly Vaseline to moisturize for about three years now and my skin is never dry anymore!
4345 2018-01-30 16:15:05 I don't have eczema myself but a friend who suffered from it said taking evening primrose oil capsules regularly really helped.
4346 2018-01-30 16:14:59 Yup.

Barrels? Nope.
Oil? Nope.
Russian ship? Nope.

The LNG shipment was not coming from a company under sanctions, that's the problem. It was French ship. They need to rewrite the sanctions very creatively if they want to stop that "laundred" LNG.

4351 2018-01-30 16:14:16 why r people hating on coconut oil it is literally the best thing to exfoliate with in the shower bc it's antibacterial and it puts a protective coat on you for the day
4352 2018-01-30 16:14:15 It's an indicator that oil prices are getting higher OR frackers have found a way to lower their cost of production, making lower oil prices tolerable.

4354 2018-01-30 16:13:59 Dumps tax “reform” isn’t working???? Gifting oil companies the lowest production tax in the country has hurt this state.
4355 2018-01-30 16:13:44 Chinese/Africa relations have benefitted countries with huge resources like #Angola, If Africa dumps IMF we need to renegotiate our natural resources for an African dinar. Time to remove the oil dollar from our markets and replace it with an African Dinar.

4376 2018-01-30 16:11:59 Wrong analysis. At $48 pbd shale oil becomes profitable. Americans would start pumping shale oil. This wouldbcap upper price of crude oil now. American shale oil and Canadian Tar sands oil would not allow crude prices to be jacked up.

I look forward to your reply
4642 2018-01-30 15:47:37 That's part of the deal to install democracy in the middle east. Make their farmers rich and the U.S. government gets control of  Oil, Lithium Ion for rechargeable batteries and Opium Poppy for prescription painkillers.

4644 2018-01-30 15:47:11 1/3 Personally, I've heard the phrase "out of context" more often from right than from left. Remember Greenspan's book? He made a pretty clear statement that a certain war was "about oil." He later suffered truth teller's remorse.
4645 2018-01-30 15:47:06 Oh it is always about money and oil. There are some interesting documentaries and reading on this. Of course one must make their own conclusions but with the US dollar tied to oil as it is, to me pretty evident.

4745 2018-01-30 15:37:13 don’t trust people who put coconut oil on their face and recommends it

4753 2018-01-30 15:36:17 If that happens Ana, the entire country should protest because it's evident to a 5 year old this snake oil salesman president  has quite a bit to hide and the GOP is enabling him.  They are all a disgrace!

4757 2018-01-30 15:35:54 Oh goody!  With the lifting of offshore drilling regulations they are free to cause another huge oil spill.  #GOPComplicit #MoneyTalks #EnvironmentalProtections

4759 2018-01-30 15:35:28 #CBS4Morning Why are we ignoring  his destruction of the environment? Oil drilling in the coast, reduction in National Parks, removing some pollution standards. Why are these being ignored?

4767 2018-01-30 15:35:02 Keep an eye out on news about Oil reserves. If I am correct , they will be targeted soon.
4768 2018-01-30 15:35:00 Oil is high but if you look at the curve it’s in backwardation. We need the curve move into backwardation (which I predict will happen in H2/2018). Sentiment is already changing. Your Patience will be rewarded.
4769 2018-01-30 15:34:56 The oil price differential between North America benchmark WTI at $65.63 and #oilsands WCS is over $30 today.  Why does Alberta only get $34.93 for our upgraded oil? Who set this lower price, why & how? Albertans as energy owners want to know. #ableg #abecon #abenergy

4777 2018-01-30 15:34:25 Well oil came to the surface when drilling so can't see how you can come up with no oil. Guess the jugs of oil they were pouring were brought 26km from horse hill to take a fake photo. Have a word with yourself lad

Then goes and gives our national parks to the oil companies to drill. In order to make up for the tax deficit

4868 2018-01-30 15:28:21 @1A can this oil boon (USA becoming a major exporter), can it's profits pay off (or pay down) our national deficit? Is it too complex to set that up or just not possible?

4872 2018-01-30 15:27:48 Thanks to fracking, natural gas -- a much cleaner fuel than coal or oil-- has boomed.  That has reduced CO2 more than any governmental policy.  Senator, please start focusing on real problems like EMP, pole reversal, and super volcanoes.

my favourite is in sunflower oil - love it :)
4895 2018-01-30 15:25:26 Who knew a slab of nice wood could cost you $50? Worth it though, looks great after the Danish oil and Briwax treatment.
4896 2018-01-30 15:25:24 Lots and lots of coconut oil 
4897 2018-01-30 15:25:10 충성충성
4898 2018-01-30 15:25:09 The current price for Heating Oil is $2.459 per gallon.
4899 2018-01-30 15:25:02 It doesn't matter where you go to get your oil changed, the coffee always tastes the same in the waiting room
4900 2018-01-30 15:25:00 Who told y'all to put coconut oil on your face ???

4903 2018-01-30 15:24:38 Q: How stupid are Croats? 
A: As stupid as anyone who wants to run oil tankers in the sea that is the ground for their tourism based economy. 
Q: That sounds like my parents are a brother and sister kind of stupid. 
A: I wish it were that.
4904 2018-01-30 15:24:27 Tell me why every single time I get my gd oil changed, they find AT LEAST two other problems with my car. There’s a mfing long ass screw in one of my tires, people. A SCREW. 
4905 2018-01-30 15:24:19 I've now tweeted more times than there are active oil&gas drilling rigs across the planet.
Must catch and surpass @HoriXZ0n
4906 2018-01-30 15:24:19 Only the tea tree oil affects them??
4907 2018-01-30 15:24:18 The memo or the American Revolution (even a wikipedia article.) He a sham and huckster. During the American Revolution he would be selling "musket-wound snake oil salve" from a cart just outside Valley Forge.
4908 2018-01-30 15:24:16 An oil-based exfoliator has really been helping me lately. You can make it yourself with rose water, coconut oil, and raw sugar. I found mine for $4.99
4909 2018-01-30 15:24:16 I can tell how warm my room is by the consistency of my coconut oil. Today it's "mostly solid, just kinda mushy around the edges."
4910 2018-01-30 15:24:10 The screen under my speedometer is switching between “low fuel level”, “wiper fluid low”, and “change oil soon” 
4911 2018-01-30 15:23:55 #Nigeria's energy needs are being handled by generators and have chronic shortage of fuel irrespective of the sad fact #Nigeria is an oil producing state. Where is the massive oil revenue goes to? How do you even consider a triumphant joint venture with such a state?
4912 2018-01-30 15:23:51 Jiffy lube loves to finesse their customers...Come in for oil change end up spending 100's #Scammers #TuesdayThoughts
4913 2018-01-30 15:23:50 Crude Oil Made Low 4096

4915 2018-01-30 15:23:33 Can they put baby oil on them too and then fight over their baby daddy?
4916 2018-01-30 15:23:29 And that’s why @gop like 45- he’s a master con man, sellling snake oil to the masses.
4917 2018-01-30 15:23:19 The Keto diet is high fat and low carb. Jordan and I have been on it for a month and it’s going great  High fat like cheese, avocado, heavy cream, olive oil. Also, only having 20 net carbs a day; 30 net carbs at the most. There’s carbs in everything so you have to count
4918 2018-01-30 15:23:17 Regaluhan niyo ako ng sunflower oil para #Sunflower2018 huhuhuhuh
4919 2018-01-30 15:23:11 If you have chicken breasts lying around, unpe tikka ya tandoori masala lagao, fry in sumsum oil. Eat.
4920 2018-01-30 15:23:10 Find out more about carinata at the upcoming ABLC.  This oilseed creates the opportunity for significant oil and meal production from a winter cover cash crop with ultra-low LUC/ILUC.  Agrisoma, ARA, and UofFL will highlight the work of the SPARC NIFA/AFRI CAP.
4921 2018-01-30 15:22:54 So my car is broke down, it broke down last night before my date so my sister legit had to drive me to meet up with my date. And now it's like completely dead. Need a new battery and a oil change probably.

4930 2018-01-30 15:22:29 You moron; investing in oil rigs off our coasts. Further destroying our oceans and environments. Honestly, put a cork in it.
4931 2018-01-30 15:22:26 เผือกหมดค่าาาาาา
4932 2018-01-30 15:22:12 AGREE

THE HOUSECLEANERS HAVE ARRIVED. 

THIS WILL NOT BE PRETTY BUT IT WILL BE A RELIEF AFTER 8 YEARS OF WATCHING A SNAKE OIL SALESMAN TAKE OUR PEOPLE, TAKE OUR MONEY, TAKE OUR HOPES, TAKE OUR COUNTRY AND DEMEAN US & IT THE WAY HE DID.

I PRAY THAT PAYBACK GOES 2 THE TOP
4933 2018-01-30 15:22:11 After 12.5 months my car is finally close to needing an oil change. Great timing w a trip and MG coming up  guess I’ll add that to the list of things to do this week.
4934 2018-01-30 15:22:11 Thought they were skint,sane gets injured,2 days later offer 60 million for a temporary replacement...fucking joke club....oil,FIFA need to take a close look at finances because it's not generated through fans
4935 2018-01-30 15:22:10 So this face oil I want is £48, why is everything I want so expensive 
4936 2018-01-30 15:22:06 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.

4938 2018-01-30 15:21:57 I usr oil
4939 2018-01-30 15:21:54 Is natural gas considered oil? From what I’ve read, it sounds like fracking and cheap natural gas is what has put coal and nuclear power plants at a disadvantage
4940 2018-01-30 15:21:53 5555555
4941 2018-01-30 15:21:42 Translation: "Yeah a law was passed, but we're not taking it seriously, because we really don't want to piss off Vlad and his oil exec comrades."
4942 2018-01-30 15:21:42 Perhaps if America (and all other countries) invested in infrastructure which added value to Africa’s raw resources (minerals, crude oil etc) rather than just extract them there would be jobs for locals and not just expatriates in sub Sahara Africa.
4943 2018-01-30 15:21:38 A string of deadly attacks in Afghanistan exposes government weakness, limits of US training effort: THE FACT IS, THE AFGHANS WANT THEIR COUNTRY BACK from the CORRUPT REPUBLICUNT "KOCH"-SUK'N CORPORATE "OIL" HOODS !!! BOYCOTT TREASONOUS TRUMP'S "STATE of HIS CORRUPTED UNION"!
4944 2018-01-30 15:21:36 Oil Money
4945 2018-01-30 15:21:35 Washington State’s gov said NO to a proposed oil rail terminal yesterday, which does not bode well for dying coal.
4946 2018-01-30 15:21:30 i can’t do straight coconut oil either, I break out like crazy.
4947 2018-01-30 15:21:18 Hey @rsohoni watched the @FT chat earlier and was getting distracted thinking what secret shampoo or moroccan argan oil is Reshma using because her hair looks super heaaaalthhhy lol. Hope you're well btw and good points on the interview! :)
4948 2018-01-30 15:21:05 Are any other property owners on #Dupont getting a ton of actual letters in the mail, addressed to them, from real estate agents wanting to buy their property?  Or is there an oil well under mine that I was unaware of?
4949 2018-01-30 15:20:59 @1a listening to the talk on Shale Oil, and the way fracking was described was a bit misleading. It's more squeezing plates to break them, not shaking them.
4950 2018-01-30 15:20:57 Muka lahi kering grepesan pake banget. Semalem dipakein bio oil punya mama paginya langsunh lembab. Biasanya udh ngelopek2 kering 
4951 2018-01-30 15:20:53 put eggs milk in bowl with cinnamon and vanilla whisk till well blended dip both sides of bread be sure your skilled is hot and with a teaspoon of oil put bread in and keep it on one side for about a minute each then flip and french toast.
4952 2018-01-30 15:20:46 After sitting in line for a half hour, I’m starting to doubt how instantaneous this Instant Oil Change is going to be.

4955 2018-01-30 15:20:30 However, the Paula's Choice cleansing oil is cool with me and it has coconut oil along with sunflower, jojoba, and grapeseed oil.
4956 2018-01-30 15:20:18 Let me know as well. I looked it up 2 years ago and only a few oil companies were half that ( without growth ). Now I doubt there are any.
4957 2018-01-30 15:20:02 Jovan Musk for women. Both the oil and cologne spray.

4959 2018-01-30 15:20:00 #CrudeOil equities getting hammered after being on the verge of a breakout. The commodity gets stronger, yet equities are stuck near their lows. Once again there is a disconnect in valuations as investors had a higher valuation at $55 oil in 2016 than $65 oil in 2017. #OOTT
4960 2018-01-30 15:19:51 Motorcycle crash with oil in the right lane in #SanDiego on 52 WB before 805, stop and go traffic back to 163, delay of 8 mins #SDtraffic
4961 2018-01-30 15:19:51 Perhaps China uses acchain to digitize gold and offers a gold backed coin bringing stability to the markets and ending the use of the petro/fiat dollar. Russia and China just announced the plan to bypass the fiat dollar to trade oil.
4962 2018-01-30 15:19:42 @bamabroker out DRIP t 11.74 from 10.50 on 11k shares. Just have a feeling everything is green tomorrow except gold and oil. DRIP is not oil
4963 2018-01-30 15:19:40 Oilsands crude is the cheapest oil in the world my friend. You've totally missed the point.
4964 2018-01-30 15:19:22 How can you speak about the use of oil and not even mention the effect it's having on our ecosystem and climate?? Really @1a
4965 2018-01-30 15:19:18 オイルだって怒るんだぞ怒ったら引火してギトギトのボーボーにしてやるからな
4966 2018-01-30 15:19:18 And great, more oil spills in ancient fossil fuel industry. What happened to renewable resources? Why are you letting China take over solar power???
4967 2018-01-30 15:19:16 Coconut oil is horrible for the skin n hair.
4968 2018-01-30 15:19:14 #OIL retrace higher too agressive for me, exit $DWT 11.27 2.9% gain. #WATCH for roll over then 2nd leg lower to continue.
4969 2018-01-30 15:19:13 but i dont have any olive oil
4970 2018-01-30 15:19:09 Also, have an essential oil diffuser in your car to optimize your immune system and protect you further from cold and flu virus.
4971 2018-01-30 15:18:58 they have oil - olive oil, that is

4973 2018-01-30 15:18:52 Some people havw been calling the memo a bombshell. In fact, it’s a “psalm sell” - irresistible snake oil for evangelicals to buy into, to rationalize their continued unwavering support for a pompous, sacrilegious serial adultering hamhanded lying blowhard. #MuellerTime #mueller
4974 2018-01-30 15:18:51 OIL OIL OIL . と紙に書くとサザエさんに聞こえる。
4975 2018-01-30 15:18:50 My youth group has an activity we call the "Discombobulation" - teens separated into small groups, paired with a driver, go all over the town doing silly or uncomfortable things - checking someone's oil at a gas station, tripping in a crowd, handing out toilet paper, etc.
4976 2018-01-30 15:18:45 Russian oil import arrived in Boston due to a lack of U.S. pipeline needed to send liquified natural gas from the Appalachian oil fields. Gulf coast ships can't ship LNG to New England b/c law requiring all  shipping between U.S. ports be on American built ships; none qualify.

4978 2018-01-30 15:18:29 How does increased oil production affect me? It delays production of renewables. I breathe pollutants, drink tainted water. All the effects of climate change.
4979 2018-01-30 15:18:23 Lactic Acid and Rosehip Oil! I could not live without those two
4980 2018-01-30 15:18:17 I even come up with a better way to conduct electricity and I didn't again from it as well ,. And the none of the oil deal to  and I built airplanes and didn't gain any but away to suffer because of life of people pets
4981 2018-01-30 15:18:15 Straight coconut oil was too heavy for me. I used it to take off my makeup and was thinking what cleanser is supposed to get this shit off.
4982 2018-01-30 15:18:14 nope because tectonic plates like been told to us do not exist, and can it not be so that earthquakes exist since we take oil gas minerals ect out of the ground? and for now quakes can be generated with haarp so man made quakes
4983 2018-01-30 15:18:07 Putin Stages Syria Peace Talks Boycotted by Assad Opponents:CAPITALISTIC "OIL" CORRUPTION HARD AT WORK !! This is just another very good reason to BOYCOTT TREASONOUS LARDAZZ TRUMP'S "STATE of HIS CORRUPTED UNION" BULLSHIT SPEECH !!!!!!!!!!
4984 2018-01-30 15:17:44 You're absolutely right! BECAUSE WM DOESN'T TAX THEM! WM hasn't set up an Oil fund... But those companies are making money & paying salaries & spending in Scotland so SOME of the money is coming back to Scotland. Not enough though. Scotgov will make them pay PROPER TAXES.
4985 2018-01-30 15:17:36 Last I checked, Italy managed to grow exports by more than Canada post-crisis. La dolce vita is almost as valuable as oil (apparently)

4989 2018-01-30 15:17:15 @1a How will solar energy compare to the oil industry in the future in the United States? Will That industry grow to be as competitive?
4990 2018-01-30 15:17:02 You can blend with olive oil and lemon juice and freeze. The resulting mix can be used in lots of sauces.

4997 2018-01-30 15:16:41 กระดาษโมเดลประกอบคืออะไร?
4998 2018-01-30 15:16:34 So why are still using oil which produces greenhouse gases while we are facing a climate crises? Doesn't this also effect all of our health? @1a
4999 2018-01-30 15:16:28 plus all that oil and stuff will keep us prosperous forever, eh?
5000 2018-01-30 15:16:23 At @UCT_news #UCT for example they have already for years produced research on #resilient urban #water services; problem is the #mindset mostly of #planners, #engineers who are stuck, #Vestedinterests, in #inappropriate methods equivalent to  #oil / #nuclear #industry in #energy
5001 2018-01-30 15:16:20 The people who say we have to run our nation off of coal and oil are the same people who think the earth is 5000 years old 
5002 2018-01-30 15:16:19 Obama's JOB KILLING regulations on drilling for oil ARE GONE! If there are oil spills in the Gulf of Mexico, MEXICO will pay for it!
5003 2018-01-30 15:16:09 @1a  - will the new import tariffs on solar panels help the oil industry?
5004 2018-01-30 15:16:02 Tamanu Oil is kind of amazing
5005 2018-01-30 15:16:01 Tillerson has made some sweet oil drilling laws for his old firm.  Guessing congrats are in order to the execs and stockholders of Exxon.

5009 2018-01-30 15:15:39 @1a how much of the oil produced in the USA stays in the USA?
5010 2018-01-30 15:15:12 The model 3 is the first step, and they will get cheaper. Oil companies are basically running America now, and ruining the environment.
5011 2018-01-30 15:15:01 Never use the phrase, "Cultured Meat Leader" around an oil and gas landman. #OOTT #natgas

5031 2018-01-30 15:12:39 Nono you misheard. What he actually said was a “psalm sell.” In other words, it’s going to be irresistible snake oil for evangelicals to buy into, to rationalize their continued support for a pompous, sacrilegious serial adultering hamhanded blowhard.
5032 2018-01-30 15:12:24 Trump/the GOP don't care. They care about big money bribes for favors by the oil and coal industry. Our US politicians are corrupted by wealthy donors. All of you. #CampaignFinanceReformNOW #SuperPACRestrictionsNOW #AntiPropagandaLawsNow
5033 2018-01-30 15:12:24 Wb oil?
5034 2018-01-30 15:12:01 His statement implied that oil companies (who do all the work) make zero profit because big bad England steals it all. So Maersk make nothing, BP make nothing, Royal Dutch Shell make nothing etc.
5035 2018-01-30 15:12:00 Oil companies investing while we put solar energy companies out of business is not great news for America.  Stop being a slave to the White Supremacy House.
5036 2018-01-30 15:11:51 ใครทำไรพี่อ่ะ ฟ้องมาเลยยยย
5037 2018-01-30 15:11:50 Awalnya niat gua adalah sertifikasi K3, biar ada modal lah buat di oil and gas mendatang. Tapi Allah berkata lain. Tadi sore pas lagi ngaso nonton pelem, tiba2 di telepon sama sodara gua: "sel, buruan ke kantor. Lu dipanggil." Spontan shock dong gua, sore2 dipanggil gitu.
5038 2018-01-30 15:11:40 No entiendo,  los camiones no usan gas oil?
5039 2018-01-30 15:11:33 Right after the Administration dropped a 30% tariff on solar energy wiping out the competition. When you figure out how to make oil a renewable energy please give me a call. #ProfitsOverPeople

5045 2018-01-30 15:10:55 But i sgt cintakan bio oil. Sbb banyak fungsi dia. Boleh guna utk scars, massage kat muka boleh keluar whitehead, also act as moisturizer.
5046 2018-01-30 15:10:49 He looks like he's covered in oil.
5047 2018-01-30 15:10:46 Opioids are the new oil maybe.
5048 2018-01-30 15:10:39 Agree with switch to NG but my point is US has sanctions on Russian oil & gas & we’re buying LNG from Russia. Seems odd. THAT’s my point.
5049 2018-01-30 15:10:39 My hairdresser straight up lied to me that you can’t oil hair after smoothening now when i applied oil,my hair is still perfect! #EffU MR! I was scratching my head all 4 months before knowing your lies!   #hair #smoothening

5058 2018-01-30 15:10:05 I think it's more that people think Nutella is mostly chocolate and hazelnut with small amounts of the other stuff, and this demonstrates the opposite, rather than OMG palm oil. Nobody is saying don't eat it, they just want people to be informed.
5059 2018-01-30 15:10:01 So I had ran out of castor oil making Christina’s so I haven’t made yours yet  but I’ll bring it Thursday if you’ll be at school

5070 2018-01-30 15:08:43 And yet, Cove Point and the newly proposed Compressor Station (in Charles County) will only help Dominion make billions of dollars by EXPORTING the oil. None of it will benefit local communities.
5071 2018-01-30 15:08:42 Coal has fed my family and my state for many years. I'm concerned about the lack of vision from both parties in creating an alternative revenue stream for our state when the coal, oil & gas markets drop again. KY, TN, IL, PA have all found a secondary source of revenue but not WV

5108 2018-01-30 15:04:30 You mean the money we made through countless years of success.... Without oil money they would be league 2 with Stephen Ireland as Captain... This is a fact
5109 2018-01-30 15:04:23 Sounds like Ziggy's perfect day off. Watch the sunrise, disassociate for a second, rebound with some awkward social interactions... Maybe work on the van a little. Man, maybe you should go get an oil change today, just, you know, get super method with it. 
5110 2018-01-30 15:04:19 I can’t believe there are so many roobs in this country that are completely fooled by our incompetent, snake oil sales man potus....has this country really become that stupid? #MAGA #DACADeal #AlternativeFacts

5112 2018-01-30 15:04:13 lol Israel and Turkey have been working together to steal Syria's oil for 6 years the only thin Israel is afraid of turkey is it might get all the oil, you need to go lookup the greater israel plan, turkey taking northern #Syria is a big part of forming greater Israel

5115 2018-01-30 15:04:12 No I wrap with a silk wrap and put a little coconut oil on my slap. You have to find a natural hair. I love a good blowout, but only twice a year. Lol
5116 2018-01-30 15:04:10 A scoop or two of premium vanilla ice cream, drizzled with extra virgin olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt. That's right. Olive oil. [Stuff I learned today.]
5117 2018-01-30 15:04:08 On one hand I'm really glad that the #keto diet has gotten more popular, but on the other hand there are 1000 internet randos willing to fight me because I once said mustard oil is keto-friendly.
5118 2018-01-30 15:04:06 So you're asserting that Trump is bowing to Big Oil (which Republicans always do) and not to Russian oligarchs (for personal profit and/or kompromat)? I'm betting on the latter, but I kinda hoping for the former. #RussianSanctions
5119 2018-01-30 15:04:06 Had the same a few months ago ,a big American oil man ,I dropped it to £60 cos of traffic but he threw £100 at me and told me I deserve every penny for driving in that crap,love the yanks

5134 2018-01-30 15:02:43 England's only revenue is coming from the oil fields...  consequently the owners of the oil have been given many seats in gov, and have now claimed the UK islands as their own.
5135 2018-01-30 15:02:33 You’re talking about the theory of abiogenesis, not the theory of evolution. If you had any compelling evidence, I’d happily listen. What you have is a bronze- age myth and snake oil salesmen like our mutual friend Ken.

Only Hillary could make this guy viable. Holding out hope. Swamp draining and all. Not looking good at this time.
5143 2018-01-30 15:01:41 I blame the GOP because they never allow funding for infrastructure.  Obama had infrastructure plans for 8 yrs and GOP refused to fund it and  even took our strategic oil reserves to fund a shortsighted 5 year plan that no big projects can plan for getting done in 5 yrs.

5147 2018-01-30 15:01:18 Please talk about FERC. Why can it overrule states and communities against oil projects? When does it ever side with communities instead of the industry? Why do they rarely reject projects?
5148 2018-01-30 15:01:08 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or revisit them.
5149 2018-01-30 15:01:03 @Varneyco, Berkshire Hathaway does not have the best interest of patient care.  This is one more industry grab by Warren Buffett. Just look at what is going on with Berkshire Hathaway Energy. If you control energy, oil and health care you control the people.

5152 2018-01-30 15:00:58 Food for thought for our folks. I am a sole decision analyst at a multinational with over N4B in monthly revenue rolling out insights for decision making but your MCM cannot trust my competence to handle his 5 employees oil business. He is 65
5153 2018-01-30 15:00:58 I think somebody in one of the treads about this said they get their oil from renewable sources; but I didn't look it up myself
5154 2018-01-30 15:00:52 These bedfellows are all serving the 'globalist' agenda, along with Merkel, Obama, Macron, Blair, Soros and Trudeau.
Donald Trump is a nationalist, like, say, former Cdn PM Stephen Harper or Anne Marie Waters.
Globalists put their agenda far ahead of their nation's.
Oil & water.

5167 2018-01-30 15:00:26 I have never claimed something like this. Fans are to emotions like media is to making money. Every United fan atm is after Pep and his spending. U can see ridiculous amount of Oil money being spent. All i can see are people being salty of the magnitude of Alexis' salary.
5168 2018-01-30 15:00:25 Honda tried again.  Sorry I can’t afford to be tricked into spending $400 every time I come here for an oil change. 
5169 2018-01-30 15:00:21 Pep literally wants to buy the Epl title with the oil money.
5170 2018-01-30 15:00:18 When it really does become a more practical investment, renewable will surpass oil/coal. I would have nothing against that. Most places just have huge subsidies that make them a viable business. I also agree that tariffs are detrimental, whether it's solar panels or anything else
5171 2018-01-30 15:00:12 i use coconut oil for my ends

5187 2018-01-30 14:58:41 I wish literally anything but this was going viral today. "Rodent in a chemical bomb that's making it act bizarrely" is as fun as "watch these ducks soaked in oil flail around".
5188 2018-01-30 14:58:39 Oil prices seem low (oil is storable so impending extreme scarcity would reflect in spot prices)
5189 2018-01-30 14:58:32 Nothing it will lick. Feed coconut oil? In small quantities?
5190 2018-01-30 14:58:22 Plus, his maths is very bad... and he has zero moral high-ground with his sugar... err, oil daddy bankrolling his success.
5191 2018-01-30 14:58:15 The maintenance light is usually for your oil.
5192 2018-01-30 14:58:11 That oil was probably old as shit lol
5193 2018-01-30 14:58:08 but did you consider Start-ups and companies that offer services that don't rely on the government or o the oil companies and depends on the general public as their Customers

5199 2018-01-30 14:57:38 Obama’s flexibility comment was him playing the Russians so he could extract help on Iran nuke deal; he slapped them with Magnitsky sanctions then more after Crimea annexation, which blocked Tillerson/Exxon-Russia oil deal, hurting Putin’s revenue, which he wants Trump to unblock

5204 2018-01-30 14:56:30 Now it's time to bring Petrol and Diesel under GST to control the prices otherwise Petrol soon reaches 100 Rs/litre, becoz there will be a substantial increase of crude oil price in the coming months.
5205 2018-01-30 14:56:29 The most important thing is to dry in between the water and oil.
5206 2018-01-30 14:56:26 Sure looks to me like Scott Pruitt and others in the Trump administration are in the pocket of big oil, gas and energy industries and interests.  Not sure this aligns with most American’s interests overall.
5207 2018-01-30 14:56:25 Maybe…but much less obvious differences than wind/solar/biomass/hydro, or coal/gas/oil.

5226 2018-01-30 14:54:04 It's really 6 ingredients because staples like oil and salt are ingredients as is water!
5227 2018-01-30 14:54:04 Sure, but I'd easily point blame for that at the shift in OPEC policy announced in Nov. 2016 in which OPEC ended their policy of producing as much oil as possible. That spelled the end of cheap oil, and thus #gasprices head higher. But that's not Obama's/Trump's fault.

5319 2018-01-30 14:44:03 Sanctions & regulations prob no longer require them to clean up their oil spills. Great for economy short term, terrible for planet.
5320 2018-01-30 14:43:57 This looks amazing!!! Is that oil mixed with the flavourants in the skillet? Also did you fry the steak? If so how long did that take?
5321 2018-01-30 14:43:50 You do know, that we in essence gave them a leg up on solar panels don't you? They took our tech and ran with it. While we still wanted to use coal and oil. Well the oil and coal industry did. We never change unless we're shocked into it.
5322 2018-01-30 14:43:41 In Social Media the “squeaky wheel” gets the oil. You have to put yourself out there, to find people who will relate or even debate with you, depending on what you are looking for.

5440 2018-01-30 14:32:20 Oh look this is investment in new offshore drilling that had nothing to do with the #GOPTaxScam. And it will put much more in Exxon’s pocket. As an extra bonus we have a chance for more offshore oil spills. No guarantee this oil stays here either.

5466 2018-01-30 14:30:04 Exactly. Big Oil pays for "scientists" to "do research" but they never submit their work to be peer reviewed...

5470 2018-01-30 14:29:57 It was different - this webinar focused on the weekly crude oil production estimates and the monthly production numbers. The November webinar was on how U.S. crude oil production is modeled in the Short-Term Energy Outlook. There is no replay, only slides.
5471 2018-01-30 14:29:56 yes, i love to drink oil!

5483 2018-01-30 14:28:28 Not everyone supports imprisoning children to protect land settlements,torturing political prisoners and selling National Parks for oil drilling. You do.

5485 2018-01-30 14:28:23 That’s the point SNP told us we would be rich because of oil revenues now oil revenues have fallen through the floor if we had have been independent we would be skint big time SNP are strangely silent on this topic

5492 2018-01-30 14:27:57 ...We’d like to assure you that we’re committed to sourcing with integrity, it’s one of our core values. Our Sustainability Plan commits us to sourcing our palm oil sustainably and ensuring our own brand products don’t...2/3
5493 2018-01-30 14:27:54 Oh good, just what we need, more oil drilling as demand goes down.

5496 2018-01-30 14:27:30 Some of our products do indeed contain palm oil. We're aware that palm oil cultivation can be a contributor to deforestation and climate change, and have a direct impact on the natural habitat of orang-utans and other wildlife...1/2

5507 2018-01-30 14:26:04 We neither. Oil spills don’t know boundaries. A spill at anchorage ia worse because it’ll spread even wider! There should (there might even exist) a service which enircles the StS tankers with a floating plastic wall to make sure nothing escapes the perimeter in case of a spill.
5508 2018-01-30 14:25:58 coconut oil is NOT good for your skin
5509 2018-01-30 14:25:48 I asked my 4 yr old daughter to help me change the oil. "Only boys do that" she said. But that was 1981- I'd hoped things had changed.
5510 2018-01-30 14:25:37 I need pictures of Russian oil infrastructure. I need Siberian rig locations. I need all of Exxon's properties targeted. Shell too. I need images. I can operate without but it will be broad destruction. If I don't have what I need, I'll make wide requests. All oil companies!!

This young generation with their new aged mindset are polar opposite of "the baby boomers"where we saw our parents struggles and hard work ethics. Each ingrained within those of us from that era.

5528 2018-01-30 14:22:54 I suspect all makes do the same. In warranty servicing is expensive and little more than an oil change.
5529 2018-01-30 14:22:52 So the middle east is over oil nonsense as usual, and even captain planet al gore himself is in the pocket of occidental oil.

5533 2018-01-30 14:22:26 The point is that you guys are actually proud that your club functions on oil money instead of club money.

5538 2018-01-30 14:21:50 Well congress is owned by donors, donors who make money off oil among other things. Russia has oil fields etc they sell from, and ever since the 80s there has been a proxy war on who gets the pipeline put where. Russia doesn't want to go bankrupt since Europe it's largest buyer

5540 2018-01-30 14:21:47 I was told cannabis oil helped and autistic person overcome their needs but I also heard of cancer patients taking the same thing.

Not for a reasonable add on. Klopp won’t waste money. He’s stubborn. Not FSG’s fault. We aren’t oil rich.

5584 2018-01-30 14:17:11 @SRuhle  Your missing a big issue. #Trump allowing banks to speculate with customer funds and invest in commodities like oil has increased the price of oil by 50% which is putting billions of dollars into Russian coffers to be used for military, spying and influence.

5590 2018-01-30 14:16:56 It is. Needs generous amounts of lemon and oil or it’s a bit nothingy. That can bring up consistency issues so I’d recommend baking potatoes in their skins over boiling them to keep the mass as dry to start as possible.

5617 2018-01-30 14:14:13 Brian you are SO RIGHT! However the oil e zaRepug’s are giving Trump cover. The saddest & scariest part is that Trump folks are willing 2 suppress the Democratic side of things B/C it would validate their side of the story! That is the biggest lie soi far in Trump's History!

5641 2018-01-30 14:12:16 Some are confusing oil in place, with oil that can be +produced.  Systemic conditions are throttles to the prod of oil in place.

5679 2018-01-30 14:08:26 First, the pipeline is not even going to Florida. Don’t know where you got that. Second, certainly, not all of the oil will be exported, but will be used to make us less dependent on foreign oil.
5680 2018-01-30 14:08:21 if only there was a safer, faster, better paying customer for #Canadian #oil exports
5681 2018-01-30 14:08:19 US oil consumption doesn't depend on US oil production: we simply substitute foreign oil production. Only effect of cutting back US oil production is fewer jobs, lower GDP, higher trade deficit.

5687 2018-01-30 14:07:42 Really simple recipe; slice up some fresh chicken into strips, then cook is in a pan (no oil) with; 3 tbsp honey, 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar and 3 tbsp soy sauce. Low heat and eventually the liquid will evaporate and stick to the chicken. Serve in pittas with salad.

5702 2018-01-30 14:06:52 I think to be honest, the value of the dollar has dropped by about 10% over the last year.  One effect of that is inflation of some products, which would include oil (or gas).  On the other hand it make the US attractive for business from other countries.

5716 2018-01-30 14:05:49 Surprising to see City fans comment on much Utd have spent, but fail to see how much of this money is generated without the Glazers contribution. Heck they even transferred the debt to buy the club back to us, meanwhile the Oil money is making PL like Ligue 1

5758 2018-01-30 14:02:05 Least shocking thing ever, #TraitorTrump not imposing sanctions on Russia. That's why they got him elected & why they gave him 1/6 of State oil (#Rosneft): so they can do whatever they want w/out impunity. #PutinsPuppet #ImpeachTrump @realDonaldTrump #shame
5759 2018-01-30 14:01:36 This will be the fulcrum upon which the market balances.  Some believe peak oil demand is upon the world, some do not.  In order to support the peak demand thesis, one relies upon expectations of unforeseen technological developments, which is a fair gamble.

5891 2018-01-30 13:49:07 Yea a block is just a surface area demarcation of an acreage, basically draw a square on the ground. The block can have more than one field. The field is the actual area where the oil/gas reservoir exists under the ground. You can also have a field straddling 2 oil/gas blocks.

5895 2018-01-30 13:48:33 Thee is more than enough evidence. People like you enable, indulge, hide your head in the sand and naively “believe” because to admit you’ve been “had” is just too difficult. The same as those sorry ignorant souls that fall for snake oil salesmen.
5896 2018-01-30 13:48:21 Creasy is an imperialist attacker of Muslim countries, for oil and western hegemony. She’s one of many who deserve to be called out.

5900 2018-01-30 13:47:45 Norway exports lots of oil to help pay for the infrastructure.
5901 2018-01-30 13:47:43 Must hurt that a "fake club" that's only good cause "foreign oil money" is better then a "real team" that totally hasn't spent equal if not more money than the "fake club" that's "only here cause oil money"

5908 2018-01-30 13:46:53 Oil pipelines is not infrastructure.
5909 2018-01-30 13:46:53 Because he’s one of a tiny number of public figures who speaks the truth about the west’s horrifying wars of conquest. He actually wants to stop blowing children to bits for oil.
5910 2018-01-30 13:46:51 Oil is needed to seed manufacturing infrastructure for renewable energy. 

However, once infrastructure is there (for developed world), demand will decline then oil price will be viable for less developed countries to start raising their standards of living.

5923 2018-01-30 13:44:14 You’re a small club that can’t fill its stadium on match day, your fan base is nonexistent and you talk about revenue?? Without dirty oil money you go back to being a yo-yo team.

5926 2018-01-30 13:44:00 Indian Oil Corp Chairman Singh: #India's #oil demand is anticipated to grow 3.5%-4.5% CAGR for next 5 years. #diesel demand is growing at 5% and #gasoline 10%, which is robust. @iocl
5927 2018-01-30 13:43:59 When your family owns the airway that sponsors your club, it's a little difficult to say that revenue streams are conclusive proof that oil money has no bearing on the situation.
5928 2018-01-30 13:43:56 It's easy to say all that being an outsider. Roman has lost 43% of his business due to a policy of sustenance in oil refineries. The club as you've seen has been very stingent in the past few seasons.

5955 2018-01-30 13:41:14 Could it also be that the price of oil is above $65 a barrel? That investment would go to zero if oil drops to $40 an barrel again.

5990 2018-01-30 13:37:49 so we can draw a graph to show the correlation between oil prices and worldwide democracy demand. it is linear. When the oil prices starts to rise, democracy demand on oil producing countries increase. And thanks to God, USA, holy savior, once again strikes to save the world.

6019 2018-01-30 13:34:41 Na their brexit paper was half a page of nothing, the white paper had everything covered. oil is at a high we could have used any curancy we wanted why Scotland has tradeable assets like oil gas water electricity, etc. Without Scottish products ruk has not a lot to trade with
6020 2018-01-30 13:34:35 You may also want to try using the essential oil “On Guard” or its equivalent “Theives” both support your immune system- I use On Guard daily.
6021 2018-01-30 13:34:34 Data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that oil sector contribution to GDP witnessed declines in the last four years (2013 to Q2 2017) with negative growth rates. What was responsible for this trend? @thecableng

6026 2018-01-30 13:33:58 Somehow yes.
So Chevron held 2 main licenses A/B & P/Q. Each license contains different blocks. Some of the blocks have already discovered oil/gas fields, 19 in all. Some are still exploration blocks i.e no field discovered yet.
6027 2018-01-30 13:33:56 I'm trying to talk about real solutions to issues and you are over here talking about all these pieces need to fall in place and a ton of luck. Do you know what a barrel of oil cost to produce? That's 42 gallons and it cost Opec dollars to make...
6028 2018-01-30 13:33:44 What on earth were they using that oil for in that Mobil advert? Looked highly suspicious...
6029 2018-01-30 13:33:38 I'm so coming this Sunday... hope you've got that oil

6037 2018-01-30 13:32:56 We don’t pay Ferrari either to build oil refineries or asphalt. But we still need fuel and roads. And not just cars. We pay for the roads together. And each of us pays our own fuel. Something similar should happen for data infrastructure equivalents of roads and fuel.

6042 2018-01-30 13:32:31 Also there is this issue with oil prices. During the last year it has raised from 20$ to 70$ and suddenly USA decided that another country needs their ultra advanced democracy. So to bring them "some advanced demovracy" they need a reason. And "voila", illegal weapons from Iran.
6043 2018-01-30 13:32:27 Whoah ok! I might give it a try  Which oil cleanser did you use?

6059 2018-01-30 13:30:49 I think those days are gone, hopefully. The rise of intellectual capital over tangible capital has hopefully made these a thing of the past. There is of course the small matter of Scotland’s vast tangible capital - oil, fisheries.
6060 2018-01-30 13:30:49 OIL DIFF: 4.12 -> 4.18
6061 2018-01-30 13:30:48 Because of the oil money that was invested in the 1st place.
6062 2018-01-30 13:30:39 If crude oil is just $71 pb, the petrol price is #145 per litre and the govt is already paying #26 per litre as subsidy, Imaging how much@GEJ must have been quietly paying to keep petrol price at #87 when crude was around $110pb. Yet they say subsidy was a scam.Just thinking loud
6063 2018-01-30 13:30:36 It should be increasingly easy these days - lots of oil/fat & protein crops grown in the uk & they’ll all store through the winter (eg we sell or are working production of camelina, chia, quinoa, flax, lupins, fava beans, peas, lentils, rapeseed, hemp, oats, soya, buckwheat...)
6064 2018-01-30 13:30:32 Hi Natalie, not all palm oil is grown the same. Sustainable palm oil is grown to the Principles and Criteria of the RSPO. These criteria protect primary and secondary forest with high conservation value. 1/2
6065 2018-01-30 13:30:14 Not to worry. Ice caps are growing, future is in fossil fuels, and oil prices are on the rise. All is good!

6075 2018-01-30 13:28:44 Just want to add Dr that the oil industry is undertaken serious steps in making new uses & specialized materials of oil in what is called “Crude to Chemicals” strategy. It will reduce its dependency on transportation in the long run.

6079 2018-01-30 13:28:21 The planned IPO of Saudi Aramco, billed as the world’s biggest stock market sale, remains shrouded in uncertainty. The indecision at the highest levels of government is causing angst among the oil company’s executives and financial advisers.

6082 2018-01-30 13:27:49 You're gong to call me crazy, but I have skin that's eczema prone and the best pimple treatment is tea tree oil with Vaseline. The oil fights infection while vaseline keeps skin hydrated and acts as a barrier against bacteria
6083 2018-01-30 13:27:47 I have oily skin and I think it’s less oily now? The explanation behind it is that when you try to keep your skin dry, it will actually produce more oil in order to compensate because it thinks it’s dr/dehydrated!

6095 2018-01-30 13:26:08 Arabs had the same problem -- culture with no production (some have been saved by oil) but those that didn't have enough oil descended into revolution

The purpose of the coup was to reclaim BP’s domination of Iranian oil.

6362 2018-01-30 13:01:19 I think the most disturbing thing is that regardless of weather or not( pun intended) you believe in climate change, why would you fight having a cleaner environment. Maybe if we break it down simply; oil,coal, bad- solar, wind good
6363 2018-01-30 13:01:15 [Leadership] Oil prices firmed up yesterday on account of strong demand, a weak dollar and ongoing supply cuts lead by Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, and Russia.
6364 2018-01-30 13:01:13 #Health365 #GHLWTipoftheDay --> Don’t let the label fool you! Trans fat, also known as hydrogenated oil, is found in most processed foods. These fats raise bad cholesterol and lower good cholesterol. Reach for good fats that you can find in avocados, nuts, seeds and olive oil.
6365 2018-01-30 13:01:07 My guy said to get an argon oil conditioner and mix it with vinegar. Coat it on and leave it in. I'm using a lighter weight olive oil hair mask with the vinegar. I smell like salad.

6388 2018-01-30 12:58:51 Traitor!  Is this why Traitor Trump won’t enact sanctions against Russia because of Exxon’s $500 billion oil deal with Russia.  How much Exxon stock does Traitor Trump own?  The GOP and Traitor Trump are a direct threat to our democracy.
6389 2018-01-30 12:58:39 The Elite are at it again - this time they want to sell us back our own water. If they cannot have the oil - they will take the water - or better still, BOTH. There are NO shortages of fresh water and there are de-salinisation machines; of course they TELL us it is TOO expensive!
6390 2018-01-30 12:58:34 Purchase oil shares!
6391 2018-01-30 12:58:12 Reason a 110lb marathon runner &

She puts Oil on her salad and he eats fried chicken

ALL oil is bad for us. Olive, corn, fish,ect

Oil cloggs the blood and does not mix with the water. It traps nutriants from reaching the brain too.

6416 2018-01-30 12:55:08 Congratulations on not understanding the difference between Government Oil Reserves vs the free market. Oil companies import crude from where it is cheapest. Until the price per barrel hits 80 tar sands is not making money

6424 2018-01-30 12:53:47 In 2012, @IEA reported that Nigeria loses US$7 billion (N1.159 trillion: 2014) yearly to crude oil theft.
6425 2018-01-30 12:53:30 We all should have seen this coming

If, at a time when crude oil price was hovering around $35/barrel, our govt increased fuel from N87 to N145, we should have worried about what will happen when it reaches $70

That time is upon us now

This scarcity isnt going anywhere soon.
6426 2018-01-30 12:53:18 Heat, light and oxygen are the enemies of olive oil and can make it go rancid, according to cooking experts at Good Housekeeping Institute (GHI). Keep bottles in a cool, dark place.

STOP EATING OIL !!!

It also cause MOST of our DISEASES !

It traps, oxygen, salt, sugar and toxins.

Medicine is a toxin that only can ease symptoms.

Medicine will not cure us.

Oil is not a soluble and makes the blood sluggy

It also causes heart problems

Point out to them and the Charity Commission the WHO is “convinced” this stuff increases disease significantly and no one is interested.

6447 2018-01-30 12:50:25 Is that how much it cost to not enact sanctions against Russia so Exxon can proceed with its $500 billion oil deal with Russia - traitors.
6448 2018-01-30 12:50:20 When crude oil was 120 dollars/barrel, petrol was Rs.70/ltr. Now with crude at 45 dollars/barrel,petrol is still Rs.70. Petroleum will be included in GST in 2019. People will again vote for Modiji in 2019.
6449 2018-01-30 12:50:09 I never liked the oil business, I think it limits creativity. It the reason we have not grown in order aspects as a country. Oil is bad for us as a country. South Korea and Japan don't rely on oil

6452 2018-01-30 12:50:00 I bought almond oil but not the organic, unrefined one.. I don’t even know what I was thinking because I know better
6453 2018-01-30 12:49:52 Technical Outlook for Gold, Crude Oil, DAX & MoreToday, we looked at gold/silver, WTI crude oil, and several key global equity indices, with emphasis on Europ...
6454 2018-01-30 12:49:47 Let's talk about this!!! Really! 

Kind of innocent people. When money is sucked out of market it will going to feel like this. Otherwise also global oil prices are reduced and also global inflation is it's low. 

As per I understand world will flat one day.
6455 2018-01-30 12:49:44 どなたでもキャス来ていただけるのは嬉しいものです
6456 2018-01-30 12:49:38 Seriously?  It's only football.  Also in 2016 the majority of my fellow countrymen showed themselves to be so stupid as to sign up to a Brexit sold by snake oil salesmen in a lemming like disregard for survival let alone any real concept of nationhood.
6457 2018-01-30 12:49:26 Sunflower oil, corn oil, soy oil, canola oil, all = pro-inflammatory access omega6. Like throwin gasoline on a fire in those with autoimmune expression! I know this from real ppl with autoimmune. Grassfed/Wild  fats=omega3  positiv effect in them! 
6458 2018-01-30 12:49:06 食用だけじゃない。みんなの生活はオイルによって成り立つ。オイルあっての人間だろ? オイルライフを満喫しようじゃないか。

6462 2018-01-30 12:48:54 More PROSPEROUS,
Like the £2,000,000,000,000 National UK dept
Like France Germany China owning UKs Utility Companies
Like Scotland`s Oil keeping UK going for the last 40+ years
Like, build a bridge to France ( If China will loan us £200 Bn )
Like, Homelessness the only Growth.
6463 2018-01-30 12:48:52 oil price was $100 per barrel in 2013, and about $50 in 2018.... so while we've had recent upticks, i would have thought impact would be minimal
6464 2018-01-30 12:48:48 Vote with your feet. I might have to do the same. I still want to know why this happens with sugar and not olive oil, cereal or baked beans.

6466 2018-01-30 12:48:30 Well now! US stock futures are down from 0.85% (Dow) to 0.42% (Nasdaq) with both Asia and Europe lower by similar or higher amounts. Gold is $1,342 with oil at $64.90. Tomorrow sounds like the place to be. Today feels a little cold!
6467 2018-01-30 12:48:21 Took the day off yesterday we were all quite hungover from the weekend of beer and oil leaks.  It was Monday and no one was here anyways.  The spaces on Charlton & Price are very busy (they are free) #baystreet #parking #savannah

6469 2018-01-30 12:48:10 Shut up.  How about invest billions in clean energy, and not big oil? Big oil just serves to line the pockets of GOP donors, not to exclude Tillerson @StateDept. Clean energy will save this planet and create jobs. #NoCoal #ImpeachTrump #PutinsBitch #Huckster #Resistance #Resist
6470 2018-01-30 12:48:07 Growth projection is based on assuming certain level of oil prices. If the oil prices increase more than that then growth will be less than the projection.If oil prices are less than that then growth can be greater than projection, so it works both ways: Arvind Subramanian, CEA
6471 2018-01-30 12:48:07 Just watched Everything, everything. Nice movie.
6472 2018-01-30 12:48:02 I think it's awkward that a Dutch company has so much power over oil that is not theirs, like this is a man trying to buy something that's actually ours, has been used and depleted. Still he has to fight to buy the salvage depleted oil well.. Smh
6473 2018-01-30 12:47:55 I’ve had a stomach bug and can’t cope w dairy yet. But, if I don’t have coffee I get headaches. So I added protein powder and coconut oil and blended. I need my caffeine!
6474 2018-01-30 12:47:54 Scandies had this in the 80s while Thatcher spunked our oil money on tax cuts. Cuts we can no longer afford but which have become institutionalised....

6540 2018-01-30 12:38:18 Alzheimers...How to cure it and prevent it ??

STOP EATING OIL !!!!!

We did not start to eat it until the late 1800's

Olive, Corn, Conola, Fish, Coconut, ect...

ARE ALL BAD FOR YOU !!!

Oil is not a soluble...it does not break down in the blood

It traps oxygen, sugar and salt

6581 2018-01-30 12:32:17 Alzheimers...How to cure it and prevent it ??

STOP EATING OIL !!!!!

We did not start to eat it until the late 1800's

Olive, Corn, Conola, Fish, Coconut, ect...

ARE ALL BAD FOR YOU !!

Oil is not a soluble...it does not break down in the blood

It traps oxygen, sugar and salt
6582 2018-01-30 12:32:08 Put some carrot oil on today thinking I would go golden brown instead all I want to do is lay in yogurt and cry red is an understatement
6583 2018-01-30 12:32:07 Failure to faithfully execute the laws. And no, Rexxon Russian oil statedepartment, you are not a coequal branch. You follow the laws you do  not countermand them
6584 2018-01-30 12:31:40 Unfortunately Trump got here first. He’s destroying all we hold or ever held dear as it slips away like sand under the buildings he’s built on others’ hard work. Snake oil, anyone?
6585 2018-01-30 12:31:30 Thanks @nailogical for the 6 hour black hole I fell into with your videos on my sick day last week. #DIY nail oil is now my jam.
6586 2018-01-30 12:31:19 No it does not. The US gains little from its interventions aside from keeping the homeland safe. The war for oil myth has already been debunked. The biggest economic beneficiaries of the Iraq War was America’s geopolitical rival China. That wouldn’t have been the case
6587 2018-01-30 12:31:08 Only joking but vegetarians don’t eat animals whereas vegans are against all exploitation. I’m neither but like a stout palm oil policy :)
6588 2018-01-30 12:30:52 The oil to destroy yokes remains dried up until an ardent desire for Gethsemane(place of pressing) burns in the Preacher's soul...

Gethsemane is a Prayer Press where the Olive(the Minister) is squeezed for the anointing oil to flow and break burdens borne on believers' backs.
6589 2018-01-30 12:30:52 Picture a Future to Feature in Scripture...

Ristband, ribon, candle, camphor, sticker, handkerchief, apron, anointed oil, anointed water, anointed anything- are all passive derivatives...

God's Word is Light that clarifies your Sight on the Flight to the place of your Delight.

Sometimes, dumping a career in oil & gas (where people pray for high crude prices) is so satisfying.

7024 2018-01-30 11:14:49 but yes, in a world where stocks and oil keep rising, the dollar will struggle to rally, regardless of positioning and consensus
7025 2018-01-30 11:14:45 So how do you explain the recent increase of the oil price? How can you say it’s not correlated with the flamethrowers demand?
7026 2018-01-30 11:14:42 I agree with you that things went bad due to the fall in oil price. It is just plain idiotic to base our entire economy on a product like Crude that has a very volatile price.
But! What has this government done to change that? It's still the same.

7034 2018-01-30 11:12:40 but frankly I think everything is now so correlated (stocks, oil, commodities, dollar) that it is risk-on, risk-off which determines dollar
7035 2018-01-30 11:12:32 Risk management - "We can engineer our way out of trouble"... for example, when #CSG de-watering caused the Condamine to bubble? Or #Origin failed to maintain wells in Riverslea field and contaminated an aquifer with oil? How did that go? #auspol

7169 2018-01-30 10:41:29 #oilprices Vs #GDP
#RULEOFTHUMB

For every $10 increase in oil prices,GDP growth comes down by 0.2% to 0.3%, the CAD will deteriorate by 0.4% of GDP,or $10million. Inflation will also be higher by 0.2% to 0.3%.

7185 2018-01-30 10:37:42 I disagree with you on this mark, it's not jst about falling oil price, its about Economic  policies that can help foreign companies plan, its about lack of direction, its about the way He handles the security situation in Nigeria atm, its about the highest level of Nepotism, -
7186 2018-01-30 10:37:41 I also thought it sounded awful but I was wrong, it's lovely. I think it's the oil and the slight sweetness you don't get with cows milk that makes it taste strange at first.
7187 2018-01-30 10:37:37 Chris, Russia could flourish long before the sanctions, when oil price was around $120. They don't give a damn abt country's welfare, only of their own.

7195 2018-01-30 10:34:30 Similar worries (oil, supply-demand, MSS and liquidity withdrawal, RBI concerns) led to rates spiking in 2004/05. What happened to equities after that?

7269 2018-01-30 10:16:58 That would collapse the energy sector seeing as billions is given in subsidies to coal and oil every year, that’s the only reason why they are cheap, oil would be cheaper as well if the government would force them to actually pass on the savings they make

7289 2018-01-30 10:13:12 So you have an issue with oil but you will scarf down handfuls of packages of gelatine based treats? A substance derived from proteins in pigs skin and bones? That’s just crazy.

7303 2018-01-30 10:11:04 There should be some link between rainforest destruction and increased materialist consumption, extra post-miles (and oil use) by orders online, and greater monopolization of markets of the Walmart->Amazon era. 

But there is a metaphorical comparison that is even more damning.

7313 2018-01-30 10:08:54 Bros, free your mind and look at economy around the world. Look at economy of oil producing countries. Look at Venezuela economy.
7314 2018-01-30 10:08:38 Key line for indyref is to copy Norway tax system do future oil is taxed rather than giving it to multi nationals as tax write offs.

7320 2018-01-30 10:07:47 I can't wait for my generational neighbors decison to full out Abandon "Free Market Capitalism, HA!" and make the 1% rich - deservedly poor, or at the very least - having to work exactly as much as everyone does. Sadly the oil companies will have done their damage by then...
7321 2018-01-30 10:07:25 just a fair warning to anyone interested in using Tamanu oil it smells like dirty bootyhole
7322 2018-01-30 10:07:07 Also, what is 'oil'? Like, lubrication?
7323 2018-01-30 10:06:50 Just to be sure I have my #buzzwords right. #Data is the new oil. So #MachineLearning is the drilling rig? And #ArtificialIntelligence is the refinery? #sarcasm
7324 2018-01-30 10:06:43 It’s mainly the part that runs along side the yodel distribution centre. You can see the the oil on top of the water. When I walked my dog they had council workers cutting the trees, not sure if they’re still there to look.

7344 2018-01-30 10:05:22 I'd rather they riot at the fact that Nutella use palm oil. 95% of the borneo rainforest has been lost to palm oil platations
7345 2018-01-30 10:05:19 Risk is not big considering that the money wont be demanded for btw 20 - 25yrs. the gas and oil volumes will generate money.
7346 2018-01-30 10:05:14 When I put oil in my car engine, i used the dipstick hole -- didnt know there is a port right on top of the engine... took me over an hour to get in that one quart.

What if he's unfit to serve? God forbid, what if he falls ill again?

7422 2018-01-30 09:46:34 Absolutely, But its the production of vegetable oil and farmed/forested product generally that causes to the wider destruction of wilderness.  Palms give a relatively efficient way of producing (a less healthy) oil.
7423 2018-01-30 09:46:18 After oil extraction from #Mustard Seed, the oil-cake that remains can be used for making #biodiesel - an efficient #biofuel that offers a clean, green energy source. I believe an Indian #MustardOil company has the patent for this process.

2. Foreign reserves 
3. Policy stability (SLS “sacked”)
4. Election cycle (foreign investors exit)

7440 2018-01-30 09:41:17 @omnibusproject Just so you know, the mummy / train thing came from a Mark Twain story about his travels. Also, coal and oil mostly formed from carboniferous trees. They just kept pulling up until a fungus evolved to digest cellolose. Trees + fungus + time = mad hydrocarbons.
7441 2018-01-30 09:41:13 Whole World is hoarding oil for its ARMIES. 
Even UAE raised fuel prices last year. Oil price in Dubai is all time high.
India too is doing it thats why the rise. Our jets tanks ships army vehicle will need it. 
Big war about to start countries are getting ready for it.

7444 2018-01-30 09:40:50 Is that mainly due to the oil and gas or some other factor?

7491 2018-01-30 09:30:09 Theory was that China cut production till oil price went up.
Instead buying “cheap oil”. They even increased storage to stockpile it. They are now biggest oil importer. Want cheap oil. Unlikely to push up prices.

7519 2018-01-30 09:22:55 Watched it, read it and understand it. Scotland could use the £ but there's a difference between using it and having BoE as central bank. There is also a massive difference between an oilfield with £1T of oil reserves and the amount recoverable so I suspect you misunderstood it.

7531 2018-01-30 09:21:10 Also, hitherto petroleum market was subsidised. It was only in 2012 that the subsidies started being repealed. In 2015 GOI gave permission for oil cos to fix petroleum prices on daily basis allowing a free market. So how do you apply "same logic" to INC which was pro-subsidy?

Why wasn't this mentioned in the discussion?
7704 2018-01-30 08:46:52 We're sorry this happened. It sounds like the oil may have separated from the product and solidified. Have you tried warming the bottle and shaking afterwards? The warming instructions are on the bottle. Please let us know if this helps.

7982 2018-01-30 07:56:48 Genuine Question : What is this snake oil business- everyone is referring to for the last few days 
Is it a very profitable business and also, is it acronym for something else 
Someone please explain
7983 2018-01-30 07:56:45 Just like the oil something...
7984 2018-01-30 07:56:31 nope not at all cause I leave a oil and leave in in it all day. so all the co washing does it replace what was already in it during the day if that makes sense

7990 2018-01-30 07:55:51 Unfortunately, due to the manager we now have, he only knows one way to build a winning team.Buying, generally, players who are @ their peak.That doesn’t build long term success where you are competing season in,season out.

7995 2018-01-30 07:54:16 You can appreciate without using his story to denigrate other young people’s hustle. It’s daft to dismiss the fact his dad his bloody Mike Adenuga. 

His dad is a major player in the oil industry in Nigeria - how gullible can one be to think he went through all that witout pops.
7996 2018-01-30 07:54:09 honestly rub chicken nuggets on your face (vegan of course)! It's good for your skin. The oil will hydrate your skin, the crumbs will exfoliate, and maybe some ketchup for toning.

8012 2018-01-30 07:51:38 As you plan to vote at the 2019 elections, consider the terrible way #Buhari handled the economy of #Nigeria. The price of oil is likely to fall below 30$/barrel by 2022. Nigeria must not go into recession again. Vote wisely!

8129 2018-01-30 07:27:32 Let us look at the actual truth. The reason things got so hard in Nigeria was simply the oil price. Buhari did not mismanage anything far more than any previous Govt had done. There is no past Govt that would have done it better, and many would have done it worse.

8257 2018-01-30 07:00:05 @sunrisedailynow: I think we should look at the skewed policies - Non-Oil Exporters must relinquish their export proceeds to the DMBs. Oil marketers are allowed to keep theirs! Where’s the balance? - That’s the current CBN Policy for Export Business

8267 2018-01-30 06:58:57 When oil prices dipped below $40, we experienced a hard hit recession. The worst in decades. It took oil prices to rise up again for us to exit it.

Oil demand is currently at 100MB/day. They predict it will drop to about 70M/day in 2021.

8272 2018-01-30 06:57:47 @sunrisedailynow the excuse about global crashes in oil prices is untenable and not new to Nigeria. Obasanjo's government met only $4BN on reserves and at some point less than $20/barrel.
8273 2018-01-30 06:57:40 But those 2/3rds would never stoop so low as to work on an oil rig or pick strawberries. I’ve done both and been a part of both worlds. The problem you just created is money. The people that work the hardest get paid the least for unskilled labor but some1 has to do it.
8274 2018-01-30 06:57:04 Scotland has no oil fund, and nobody can tell us where 40-odd years of oil profits went. Gross mismanagement.

8278 2018-01-30 06:56:27 Agreed, but more effort has to be made in regards to eliminating single-use plastic packaging.  There are already many more ecologically friendly alternatives. Our obsession with oil based products has to stop, we are poisoning ourselves and that is madness

8280 2018-01-30 06:56:04 @sunrisedailynow there was no global recession in 2014 or 2015. A slump in the price of crude has not whit on oil producing countries and not globally.

8291 2018-01-30 06:53:29 No I'm not. The Yukon would like to switch from oil and diesel fed generation of electricity. Hydro electricity is a wonderful way to achieve this. And again there is also natural gas. But they don't have the piping infastructure. ..yet. or they could go full on LNG.

8311 2018-01-30 06:48:30 I’m convinced that the only reason I’m lacking serotonin is because I’m allergic to coconuts. I can’t drown my problems in coconut oil. This is the end.

8321 2018-01-30 06:46:21 I don't find any of this bizarre. What I find weird is that people are just realizing that if you feed and water a plant, it grows. Can't happily poison a well for decades then wonder why the waters unsafe. Dems would be the same, I think, had they had the snake oil guy instead.
8322 2018-01-30 06:46:04 @chamberlainusoh @sunrisedailynow Kindly remind Ike Chidolue that oil price is over $70/barrel and that it has been on a rise since @APCNigeria came on board. So he should stop speaking as if it has consistently remained under $40

But we also have new earthquakes in Oklahoma due to fracking... Right in the way of the oil. Hilarity ensues.

8392 2018-01-30 06:36:06 Oil prices to drop to about $25/barrel in 2021 predicts analysts.

8407 2018-01-30 06:34:34 The only way to get to the “thousands” of jobs is to include the supporting jobs it creates but all that goes away once it’s complete. They are building the pipeline to make transporting the oil to Fla cheaper and faster so they can EXPORT it, it’s not for us.
8408 2018-01-30 06:34:17 The continuous high oil prices affect the fiscal position and growth along with making macroeconomic policies tighter than the norm. They would affect inflation, current account, the fiscal position and growth, and force macroeconomic policies to be tighter. #EconomicSurvey2018

8413 2018-01-30 06:33:30 Trickle down economics, possibly? Maybe mixed with a little greed? Sell it like snake oil and run it through the governmental department of G.T.C. (Graft, Theft, & Corruption) and voila!
8414 2018-01-30 06:33:27 Bruh if this shit don’t work out I’m just take off to work at  the oil fields in Texas 
8415 2018-01-30 06:33:22 Not true. Russian economy is in excellent condition despite the sanctions. The price of crude oil is high enough now to prosper.

8430 2018-01-30 06:31:17 Not to mention that solar employs more people in US electricity generation than oil, gas and coal combined. 374,000... this stupid unnecessary tariff jeopardizes all of them. The tariff is also a  to big oil. Right Mr Tillerson?

8665 2018-01-30 05:47:13 coconut oil is good for dry skin not oily, which is kinda obvious
8666 2018-01-30 05:47:02 The Governor was never going to agree to the oil coal port on the Columbia River by Kelso. It would have destroyed his environmental stand.

The hives can burn 30-60 mins w/just 2 oz. bees keep trying to fly back in through the flame. They don’t make it. No quarter.

8806 2018-01-30 05:25:31 Canada sells military vehicles to the regime, so we must think they're pretty swell.  The development improvements are wonderful, but until per-barrel emissions are at or below that of conventional oil, Canada should not be seeking to expand production.
8807 2018-01-30 05:25:15 It’s not that ppl dont want to invest, they dont want to act like its the end of the world and drive oil/gas/coal out of biz in favor of massively expensive inefficient solar/wind/water. In moderation, incrementally, renew will take over. Just doesnt have to be now.

8834 2018-01-30 05:20:27 In 1991 the Soviet Union fell, and America cheered, claiming to have bested communism. Well, in 2018, Russia has all the oil, China has all the gold, and America has all the debt—and a dumbed-down population hooked on propaganda and a desire for socialism.
8835 2018-01-30 05:20:12 Oil prices were not the only factor. The superjumbo bet is a bet on hub-and-spoke air travel. What Boeing caught - and Airbus missed - was that global hubs were already at or near capacity in all but a few markets like Australia, Singapore, and the UAE.

5. Continue shutting the fuck up.
8944 2018-01-30 05:00:57 The price of oil changes have really gone up

8946 2018-01-30 05:00:52 People pray for cake, and God gives them flour, eggs, oil, sugar and an oven, and they get frustrated and leave the kitchen.
#growup
8947 2018-01-30 05:00:48 people are disgusted because there's so much sugar and oil in nutella

watch me eating spoonfuls of that stuff because idgaf and i have to die one day, no matter what i do
so why not live life to the fullest and enjoy the sugary taste of this creamy sin
8948 2018-01-30 05:00:39 OIL DIFF: 4.1 -> 4.2
8949 2018-01-30 05:00:37 Once we officially came off the gold standard, we needed to link our currency to an asset. By controlling oil markets and forcing all oil transactions be done in USD, the petrodollar was born. However I say use crypto and fuck the USD if keeping the USD value involves murder /5
8950 2018-01-30 05:00:29 To bake a cake you must use flour, raw eggs, sugar, and oil. Eaten individually, each is pretty distasteful. But bake them together and they become delicious. If you will give God all your distasteful, unpleasant experiences, he will blend them together for good. 
-Rick Warren
8951 2018-01-30 05:00:23 It's an aroma diffuser. Like an endless incense lol. You put water & a few drops of an essential oil of your choice in it & turn it on
8952 2018-01-30 05:00:10 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
8953 2018-01-30 05:00:01 Commodities: Rubber +4.77%, Crude Oil -1.14%
8954 2018-01-30 04:59:43 #DirtyMoney on @Netflix_CA has a whole episode on Quebec Maple Syrup. Ugh. 

Why not cover what the mining and oil industry is doing in Canada. Or the treatment of First Nations.
8955 2018-01-30 04:59:30 Even the oil producers are investing in reusable fuel sources that burn cleaner and are less toxic to the environment.  Hmm, how's that winning?
8956 2018-01-30 04:59:16 Oil really!!??
8957 2018-01-30 04:59:12 "I don't know what I expected, bu it was nothing like what I found.  Two ancient lamps burned fish oil, throwing dim shadows against the dark stone walls.  There were six cots in the room, all occupied.  ... He was tied to the cot.  All of them were."
8958 2018-01-30 04:59:02 All we need is more oil spills #TaxScamBill
8959 2018-01-30 04:58:28 realizing i dont like olive oil taste anymore and im more of a grape seed oil realness
8960 2018-01-30 04:58:11 Ah yes, "premium motor oil," a staple of any shopping trip.
8961 2018-01-30 04:58:11 I love coconut oil so much 
8962 2018-01-30 04:58:08 Lool it probably was but my regret wouldn't allow me to enjoy it. Where's a good place to get jojoba oil though? I tried to re-up like last month but the prices I saw at the health food store displeased me
8963 2018-01-30 04:57:58 Go right ahead most of their cars are already electric running off solar. California is going to cut off the profits spigot to the oil companies.
8964 2018-01-30 04:57:57 Trump is getting away with it: Sanctions lifting - Russian oil fields, Exxon/Tillerson and Trillion dollar deals.  This is the most outrageously corrupt administration ever.  Makes Nixon look like Mr. Rogers.
8965 2018-01-30 04:57:51 Coconut oil is rated for many applications!
8966 2018-01-30 04:57:48 LOL. *Pours olive oil over asparagus and bake it*
8967 2018-01-30 04:57:37 thank you for this! i have a diffuser and i have a tea tree oil but now that i know it’ll hurt my cat i’m getting rid of it and any other oils that will hurt him. i’m so glad i learned this before he got hurt!
8968 2018-01-30 04:57:36 okay! & the oil?
8969 2018-01-30 04:57:21 You've got to remember that Wray is a political appointee.  He has done work for Christie and his lawyer firm has represented Russian oil interest.
8970 2018-01-30 04:57:19 Monday vibes—-> Bath bomb, face mask, essential oil diffuser, bed 
8971 2018-01-30 04:57:13 Rose hip oil might be the best thing that’s ever happened to my skin

8974 2018-01-30 04:56:49 @FBTruscott although I knew that standard oil was dissolved by the government for being an illegal monopoly, I didn’t know that they controlled 90% of American refining capacity at their height. This was even more than I had imagined it to be
8975 2018-01-30 04:56:48 A bicycle is a good vehicle to get around.  There are fuels made from used cooking oil in Texas to run diesel trucks, and it works in current engines. No mod required.
8976 2018-01-30 04:56:43 ゆうじおめでとう！！ 
8977 2018-01-30 04:56:42 Love it!
8978 2018-01-30 04:56:39 When you shave & oil your whole body  caught my hand rubbing up my leg 
8979 2018-01-30 04:56:37 Tame your headaches by rubbing peppermint oil like tiger balm to the temples.
8980 2018-01-30 04:56:31 My wife ran into an old college friend last weekend. Her husband had passed away the year before.
Wife: that's so sad, you must really miss him
Friend: I really do. The oil in my car is almost empty, and the garbage hasn't been taken out since he passed.
8981 2018-01-30 04:56:26 I'll bet the Kremlin is more worried about their third world economy now that the US is back in the oil and gas game.
8982 2018-01-30 04:56:25 I always thought Wray was up to no good.  I even wrote to my senators NOT to confirm him for the FBI director job. His private firm has ties to the Russian oil industry. On the other hand, I always thought McCabe was an upstanding member of the FBI, a role model for integrity.
8983 2018-01-30 04:56:11 I always have a gallon of Pure and Dark Tung Oil in my house.  I use it all the time!
8984 2018-01-30 04:56:03 vai de oil man que eu vou de gato louco
8985 2018-01-30 04:55:53 Amnesty incentivizes more illegal immigration so its a bad idea. Business and people with maids and gardeners get all the benefits; we get all the costs.  DACAns aren't being boiled in oil on Main St now. Their parents made a deal when they came here illegally. Keep the deal.
8986 2018-01-30 04:55:50 I have some Ordinary and Saturday Skin on the way, Glossier, too. And an Odacity Carrot face oil. I’m removing Kypris and a night cream. Skincare is my jam.
8987 2018-01-30 04:55:47 An aroma diffuser. You put water & an essential oil of your choice in it & let it go to work
8988 2018-01-30 04:55:44 My coworker bought a new car and asked me about when I bought mine. "Did your car company give you free car washes?" 
"No." 
"Did they give you a free oil change?" 
"No." 
"Did they do anything?" 
"They poisoned some monkeys."
8989 2018-01-30 04:55:29 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! Nature therapy at it's finest!!
8990 2018-01-30 04:55:14 SAMURAI行けなくなった…… #泣きながら出張
8991 2018-01-30 04:54:51 Toner helps ur face by reducing the oil production and a cleanser cleans your face in depth basically. :)
8992 2018-01-30 04:54:45 Kalau alasan krn minyak om? Secara jaman itu Irak nyimpen 60% oil reserves dunia.
8993 2018-01-30 04:54:42 Who TF frying chicken with motor oil 
8994 2018-01-30 04:54:32 Those things are huge.   The spout is basically the size of oil drums.
8995 2018-01-30 04:54:20 Damn those icky oil companies
8996 2018-01-30 04:54:17 ไม่เหลืออ่ะพี่ออย น่่ารัก น่ารัก ฮืออออออ
8997 2018-01-30 04:53:54 Rising oil prices -The Government’s challenge is to balance fiscal deficit and inflation. Used to creamy taxation rates  built on  low oil prices, can they tighten their belts? Or its heads you win tails you loose for consumers? #oil #inflation #economicsurvey18 #BudgetSession
8998 2018-01-30 04:53:45 T’s obscene reality show must end ASAP. His kleptocracy/plutocracy/kakocracy is morphing into selling snake oil from the SOTU. The world is appalled & has lost all respect for the US. How much longer can the RUS Manchurian Candidate charade show go on?  T+complicit #Impeach
8999 2018-01-30 04:53:41 Touched all the bases in Edmonton hockey, former Oil King, Flyer and played his final pro season as a WHA Oiler.

Only base missed, he never was an Edmonton Monarch.
9000 2018-01-30 04:53:41 Essential oil defuser is the best purchase i ever made im about to be in the deepest sleep  good fricken night pals
9001 2018-01-30 04:53:30 it may be they promised them a % of the profits from the Siberian oil rig since that is what russia is desperate to get out of sanctions. bc every day that is not operational during this warm trend is loss profits.
9002 2018-01-30 04:53:16 It's 8:50 AM 30th Jan in UAE Bitoasis bout to go LIVE , come on Middle-East PUMP #xrp already with that oil  money . 

#xrpthestandard #XRPARMY #BitOasis #MiddleEast #MENA #Ripple
9003 2018-01-30 04:52:59 m: I’m dumb and just spilled oil all over myself
me: is that more or less dumb than the time I lost my glasses in the ocean?
m: oh definitely less dumb. Waaay less dumb. Oil isn’t required for me to see.
9004 2018-01-30 04:52:54 Also not many are aware of nutritional value of local produce or foreign as like packaged food they do not come with labels. Worse is the story of olive oil. What good is it when you heat it to deep fry as advertised. How can 3 katori of quinoa halwa be ok?
9005 2018-01-30 04:52:38 Stop it, sautéed with garlic and olive oil! They’re delicious 
9006 2018-01-30 04:52:22 Parents have no trouble staying on the nest 3+ weeks.  They can slow down their own metabolism & sill have oil reserves for chick.The return of each parent varies.
9007 2018-01-30 04:51:43 Canada Gay friendly Oilsands at tidewater displaces dictator oil from regimes that throw our  off Buildings. Protesting Kinder Morgan pipeline = killing . @vancouverpride #LGBTQ
9008 2018-01-30 04:51:36 Like rubbing coconut oil on my chest, standing in a Captain Morgan pose while playing a kazoo?
9009 2018-01-30 04:51:32 Bacon grease is basically just lard with added salt and smoke-flavoring. I usually don't have any because I rarely buy bacon, but I ALWAYS keep a tub of lard for baking fluffy buttermilk biscuits. 

Anything fried goes in olive (low temp) or sunflower (high temp) oil, though.
9010 2018-01-30 04:51:29 Then again, it helps to be absurdly rich. Qatar just started paying for other countries to fly in food (including cows, IIRC). And it's not like the Saudis bought Qatari oil.
9011 2018-01-30 04:51:24 I was told that the only thing that works is bio oil??
9012 2018-01-30 04:51:11 Oil of oregano or black seed oil. Both taste gross but they work.
9013 2018-01-30 04:51:07 It’s the fur and the coconut oil plus I think his thang big
9014 2018-01-30 04:50:42 Oil ocean makes me ANGREEEEEE aaaAAAAAAGH #SonicMania
9015 2018-01-30 04:50:36 Please Stop Recommending Coconut Oil As A Facial Moisturizer
9016 2018-01-30 04:50:30 Okay so I know coconut oil just got exposed for being shitty for your skin but is coconut WATER gonna fuck my shit up? Or is it just the oil? #replytweet
9017 2018-01-30 04:50:15 Literally a week or two you’ll start seeing and feeling the difference! I make me a tea in the morning using water, honey, cinnamon and add a tablespoon of the black seed oil.
9018 2018-01-30 04:50:04 แค่นิดนึงก็ชื่นใจแล้วอ่ะ
9019 2018-01-30 04:49:08 Million to one, sanctions on Russian Oil Co will be lifted for Exxon & Rosnet can get into the Arctic
9020 2018-01-30 04:49:05 全ての料理はオイルなしに作れない…(作れるのもあるかも、え、あるのかなぁ)
9021 2018-01-30 04:48:55 Post grocery convo:
Dude, you forgot the olive oil
Sh** oo nga pala! its ok. I got ice cream.
Ok.. fair enough 
9022 2018-01-30 04:48:53 I put coconut oil instead of lotion on my legs and they’re super soft

9024 2018-01-30 04:48:34 How is economy up for a broad-based revival under1-severe fall in investment GDP ratio 2- decline in rural wages 3-Oil inflation risks 4- Fiscal slippage. How will Bankruptcy code or GST help a quick revival? Except Macros #economicsurvey18 is highly insightful document.
9025 2018-01-30 04:48:21 Hand picked appointees from Goldman Sachs, Exxon, and Lily. Big money. Big oil. Big pharma.
Prime mortgage meltdown, the Exxon Valdez, and price gouging. 
Donald "rich people don't like me" Trumps personal trifecta to help boost the middle class.
9026 2018-01-30 04:48:19 Well it was popular for truckers and oil field workers back in the day. Not sure what the popular upper is nowadays that hasn't been my thing for decades.
9027 2018-01-30 04:47:50 coconut oil clogs your pores and is in the long term bad for acne because it’s a sealant!! vitamin e oil would be better!!!
9028 2018-01-30 04:47:32 i just signed up for a restock notice on the rose oil, that is extremely my shit. my skin isn’t normally problematic either but i wanna give it some love as i stare down 30

9031 2018-01-30 04:46:55 Lmaoo this white women was doing her hair her eyes got all wide as she started explaining the wonders of “ coconut oil “ 
9032 2018-01-30 04:46:35 When C. Wray was appointed FBI Director, his firm represented two of Russia's biggest state oil companies: Rosneft & Gazprom. He also represented Christie in NJ BridgeGate scandal! He was never patriotic or planned to stand up to Trump and it was just as Trump admin planned!
9033 2018-01-30 04:46:23 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
9034 2018-01-30 04:45:54 Do you think allowing this pipeline reduces global oil consumption?
9035 2018-01-30 04:45:49 1:45 y yo aca escuchando la radio por mis bebés #BTSxTrasnocheLOS40

9040 2018-01-30 04:44:34 If you don't use oil during sex then your boring.
9041 2018-01-30 04:44:17 Coconut oil and sea salt
9042 2018-01-30 04:44:15 We’ve all been duped by a “snake oil” salesman once or twice in life.  He lied about everything-hopefully they’ve learned .  I try and practice empathy-we’ll need everyone to help fix the shit he’s created.
9043 2018-01-30 04:44:08 And YOUR PRESIDENT refused to sign the sanctions our reps & senators approved against Russia & Putin 4r , killing innocents, taking their country, taking personal ownership of the poor Russian peoples oil for himself, Trump& fam w Saudi banks. CO got $500B. Keepurguns oiled
9044 2018-01-30 04:44:07 no sugar, no oil, no carbs.
9045 2018-01-30 04:44:05 soup came out  glad I left that meet on the bone like my Granny said , that sh*t really made all the difference . didnt even need no oil or extra salt 
9046 2018-01-30 04:44:03 We struggle to deliver water to Africa but we ship oil and liquor like it’s nobody business. Think about it.
9047 2018-01-30 04:43:40 And the oil company’s that are charging their homes are way happy about it.
9048 2018-01-30 04:43:25 The dinosaur was just minding their own business before big oil three hundred years from now invents a time machine and hurls a rock back then at them, What will we have done!
9049 2018-01-30 04:43:23 Lavender oil baby
9050 2018-01-30 04:43:19 Syria is a toy being used by the USA & Russia. As the whole Middle East has been for over a Century. Ask someone from the Middle East is, ""Is Oil a Curse or a Blessing", they will always answer, "A Curse".
9051 2018-01-30 04:43:19 Honestly all these ppl saying 
Coconut oil is bad for your skin and hair...SHUT UP y’all are scammers 

What works for your skin and your hair (or doesn’t) isn’t the same for everybody

So do you boo 
9052 2018-01-30 04:43:10 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
9053 2018-01-30 04:42:55 A good session ipa complements spicy foods. Now I'm craving chili oil dumplings. 
9054 2018-01-30 04:42:53 Change the oil in your car don’t try and change me.
9055 2018-01-30 04:42:26 Coconut oil + baking soda works as a rlly good face mask, my skin has never been so soft
9056 2018-01-30 04:42:08 youtube poop: arthur and scooby-doo shoot donkey kong's lamp oil
9057 2018-01-30 04:42:08 Just worked out and threw up and now I’m sitting naked in the bathroom with coconut oil in my hair wondering why trying to look your best makes you feel your worst
9058 2018-01-30 04:42:06 That all hinges on Canada actually being able to get our oil to a market.
9059 2018-01-30 04:42:03 Oh that worked perfectly! I followed the instructions on the chicken pieces and it came out great! Coating the veggies with some extra olive oil helped as well!
9060 2018-01-30 04:41:55 Cottonbut + baby oil
9061 2018-01-30 04:41:44 i rub baby oil all over my stomach and back. taking feminax then sleeping usually helps
9062 2018-01-30 04:41:40 Petrodollar puppets pandering to polluting profit addicts giving nothing back except pollution. Why let non American oil companies near our old technology oil reserves to steal for profit? Lowering taxes on all multinational corporations is theft of our paychecks & resources.
9063 2018-01-30 04:41:32 If I didn’t have coconut oil for removing my makeup & mixing it with my face wash to protect the sensitivity I’d break out horribly. 

Sooo I’m just confused where this hate is coming from
9064 2018-01-30 04:41:23 Hi there....I think I'd be better off speculating on the price of oil, although our company's products are utilized in the mining industry 
9065 2018-01-30 04:41:18 催コキ……？
9066 2018-01-30 04:40:52 I do something about my guns every week... making sure I can still hit the bullseye and clean and oil them afterwards
9067 2018-01-30 04:40:51 I’ve driven 25,000 miles in 9 months done 4 engines in 3 months and a oil change every month... I’ve also owned the infinity and drove the lexus for a month
9068 2018-01-30 04:40:42 ใครมาเอ่ยยย
9069 2018-01-30 04:40:37 yeah....lets bring back that dirty oil and triple tax that clean solar energy!
9070 2018-01-30 04:40:36 I’ve been using almond oil, water, and alcohol free witch hazel w/aloe vera!  I got it from this naturalista on YouTube!
9071 2018-01-30 04:40:15 When Wray was appointed FBI Director, his firm, King Spalding, represented two of Russia's biggest state oil companies: Rosneft & Gazprom.

9072 2018-01-30 04:40:10 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
9073 2018-01-30 04:39:58 Bruh......two cups of water for every cup of rice. Bring water to boil. Once boiling lower burner to low heat. Stir often so rice doesn't stick to bottom of pot. Cook for 45-50 minutes. Pro Tip: add a little olive oil just in case.
9074 2018-01-30 04:39:57 Do y’all know how much sugar in pop? Or do y’all know how much oil is in mayo? Smh
9075 2018-01-30 04:39:34 Trying these eye drops w/ flaxseed oil (in single-use containers) ... Squeeze two drops out, then you toss the rest? What a waste! #Refresh
9076 2018-01-30 04:39:31 Bleached teeth, coconut oil hair mask, and avocado face mask. I’m living my best life rn.
9077 2018-01-30 04:39:29 Its so crazy my mom randomly came in and put blessed oil on my forehead
9078 2018-01-30 04:39:17 i use this thing from lush called greased lightening, it’s an aloe/tea tree oil gel and i rub it into my acne scars every night after washing my face and it’s really helped lighten them a loooot
9079 2018-01-30 04:39:09 I use the Luna oil now and I really do love it. I think I’m going to start scaling back and purchase something cheaper to use regularly
9080 2018-01-30 04:38:51 Water and oil a better duo than y’all niggas
9081 2018-01-30 04:38:51 imagine jimin lathering you up in oil and telling you to relax. he grabs your hair and yanks it off then pushes you in the fryer. 

“bone apple teeth you are now fried chicken.” 

then he serves you to cnco and they die from ugli
9082 2018-01-30 04:38:48 Petrodollar puppets pandering to polluting profit addicts giving nothing back except pollution.

9083 2018-01-30 04:38:39 まあ単純に削り量が変わると言えばそうなんだけど
9084 2018-01-30 04:38:37 Harper did more to harm AB and pipeline construction than anybody else! Another term of Harper and our “ dirty oil” would have been banned by the EU...
9085 2018-01-30 04:38:26 Watching white people on YouTube acting like they discovered coconut oil is always entertaining to watch
9086 2018-01-30 04:38:24 Tell Congress? Afraid they could care less. GOP are clinging to Trump. There's more to be done. Strip Medicare, Medicaid, SS, pivatize VA, infrastructure. More oil deals abroad perhaps a war for oil...

9089 2018-01-30 04:37:53 Russia.  Still clinging to that?  Though apparently Putin loves the America first policies, a bigger US military, loves that we are becoming more energy independent.  He also loves that oil prices are staying low. Loves economy and stock market is soaring. Sure
9090 2018-01-30 04:37:40 Yeah what was Russia’s budget going to be 20 years from now when green energy could have been leading the field and all Putin has Is oil he can’t get to bc of his crimes?
9091 2018-01-30 04:37:03 Time to stop the payoffs to politicians for favorable tax laws for the rich & oil/gas industry laws, as well as withdrawing EPA regulations. #Resist

9098 2018-01-30 04:36:30 It's also 100% of peer reviewed climate scientists. That 3% is the non-peer reviewed bought-and-paid-for-by-big-oil group whose nonsense science gets blown out of water in the most basic review. It's as much a theory as gravity.
9099 2018-01-30 04:36:28 In 1981 the inflation was almost highest ever because of oil and gold prices

And the S&p500 p/e was under 1

Because of that
9100 2018-01-30 04:36:19 Been saying that! The GOP Congress showed their true colors over ACA and not forcing Trump to enforce sanctions last October. Russia is supplying heating oil in Boston. They are supplying steel. Unless the military takes over, & arrests the turncoat Generals first. We are stuck.

9104 2018-01-30 04:35:55 No, but this is what Natives are calling oil and their pipelines. It is The Black Snake.
9105 2018-01-30 04:35:37 Predicting oil price is become a tricky job something similar to meteorological department predicting rains in India.
Best way to predict is when u have it

9119 2018-01-30 04:33:45 How long do you boil the fry cut potatoes for before tossing with the oil?
9120 2018-01-30 04:33:34 Dumb.  Now that oil will have to be transported to either Canada or Mexico for shipment at likely dirtier facilities.  Washington could have had the cleanest oil facility in the word, a model for everyone, instead they get nothing and every drop of that oil gets shipped anyway.
9121 2018-01-30 04:33:34 I.... actually am not a fan of coconut oil unless Im mixing it with something. Never understood the hype. It doesn’t do much for me.
9122 2018-01-30 04:33:29 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes
9123 2018-01-30 04:33:26 someone will put fire in that oil. better to take one step after the other. regional integration is surely on the horizon, but first solutions need to be found within Syria and within Iraq, respectively.
9124 2018-01-30 04:33:18 Haven’t heard of that crackdown but obviously assume their control because of oil and such. And most people don’t care cuz msm didn’t really criticize Obama too much. They take every shot at Donny. I was actually surprised to see this article was wiki

9129 2018-01-30 04:32:29 I am thinking of trying the cbd oil to help with my panic attacks and daily anxiety but I'm a little scared plus my doctor says to stay on my meds
9130 2018-01-30 04:32:20 Somebody had to be interested in that oil unless you wanted to use it for fire at home. If Americans are interested in the oil that is good news. It is up to kenya to negotiate a good deal. That is what the oil is for.

9153 2018-01-30 04:28:03 Sorry to hear this, I've read that the oil eases and helps to a degree. Hope someone on here can point you in right direction.
9154 2018-01-30 04:27:47 yes and im sure the oil industry just keeps to themselves and allows other to control where the chips fall
9155 2018-01-30 04:27:39 I know there are a lot of things that have the palm oil in... but this is a specific product that they both have said they will not make with palm oil, bloody BS artists. No store bought hot cross buns again this year, just my bastardized version of them...

9160 2018-01-30 04:26:51 If you heat up olive oil and put it on your roots for 30 minutes and wash it out twice a week it works really well. It made my hair grow so quickly and so long

9183 2018-01-30 04:22:49 my body hates coconut oil.
9184 2018-01-30 04:22:46 Also, lots of chopped veggies in the fridge. If they’re washed and chopped I’m waaay more likely to toss them with oil and salt and roast while I heat up my chicken and rice from the freezer
9185 2018-01-30 04:22:39 I don't understand at all how this is a bottle opener. Unless the bottles it opens are bottles of snake oil.

9203 2018-01-30 04:20:00 I bought a used Chevy Volt 3 yrs ago. Old car (22mpg) used 18 barrels of oil per yr. Chevy Volt only uses 3 1/2 barrels of oil per year. If more people would drive EV's, we would not need more of their oil. Lets move our nation forward in a positive manner. Use wind & solar.
9204 2018-01-30 04:19:55 Aku rasa lah utk yg oily skin yes boleh pakai produk yang ada bahan tea tree oil. Any kind of product lah. Tapi tak boleh consume untuk jangka masa yg lama sbb once dia dah stable kan kulit kita dari terus berminyak teruk, kita kena stop. Kalau tak skin kita boleh jadi sgt dry

It's all in the open!

9235 2018-01-30 04:14:46 The sticker is helpful to let you know when it’s getting near for an oil change . Sometimes you can go a little past the mileage listed on the sticker but I wouldn’t advise going over too much
9236 2018-01-30 04:14:45 It was so good. I didn't even take a picture. After I let it rest, I sliced it and then sat the fuck down. Just roasted with fennel pollen, s+p, and olive oil, that's it! So good. Didn't need a thing.

9308 2018-01-30 04:06:48 Tea tree oil is tricky and best results happen when it's mild. Body shop is mild but pricey. I use it for scars and spot treatment occasionally. If yours is pretty strong try mixing it with milder oils. Like rosehip.
9309 2018-01-30 04:06:43 why does fuckin every skincare product have fragrance and/or oil in it???? i’m stressed af and even the skin right below my eyes is crusty af and idk why because i’ve been using this eye cream for a while and never have had dry ass eye skin like this while using it

Anyway, I assume it turned out they were in the upside down all along.
9320 2018-01-30 04:05:07 I’m currently on tea tree oil. The effect quite slow. Stings abit but after a while I get used to it. I’m doubting the outcome of this oil.

9384 2018-01-30 03:56:03 He was about to change the African currency to a gold based currency and only sell his oil for that. The rest of Africa was set to agree. You probably think Saddam had WMDs and America would have invaded if their main trade was Pork Bellies, am I right?

9392 2018-01-30 03:54:55 I think Trump and all the GOP that are enabling oil and gas should be the ones forced to inhale the fumes.....Donald, Tillerson, Zinke, Rick Perry, et al,,,,line up and take a BIG breathe.
9393 2018-01-30 03:54:52 @TheLastWord : Your guest is one of the stupidest people in the U.S. that put this country and it people at risk by voting for @realDonaldTrump. Every information about Donald scam work was public. Trump is a snake oil salesmen. Remember "Trump University?"

9396 2018-01-30 03:54:36 .@Lawrence Honestly... Donald Trump has always been a liar and a seller of snake oil.  Carrier lie is no execption. If voters had looked at his record instead of listening to his incomprehensible rhetoric then maybe we would not be in this horrifying situation. .@WhiteHouse

9409 2018-01-30 03:52:55 As for oil: He was already selling it. Why would we overthrow him to get his oil into the market when he was already selling it to us? Doesn't overthrowing him just make the oil industry less productive because there's chaos, etc?

I'm not saying he's a good guy, don't be confused. I'm asking: who finds death, anyone's death humorous. Maybe HRC does, it's her hobby.

9453 2018-01-30 03:48:05 The other concurrency is Inslee's argument that the benefits of an oil terminal are outweighed by the risks. As if heroin addicts and tweakers living in tents and shitting in the streets is an acceptable outcome for de facto  decriminalization of their bad choices
9454 2018-01-30 03:47:54 Jojoba Oil & Coconut Oil will get you right

9456 2018-01-30 03:47:50 I just recently read that his law firm represents two of Russia's biggest oil companies. That should ring alarm bells to those paying attention.

9470 2018-01-30 03:45:04 Jojoba oil is what coconut oil aspires to be.
9471 2018-01-30 03:44:40 5L Motor Oil is about K80, filters depending on vehicle ranges from K15 to K50. Thats less than a K150 for materials alone. Labour cost is BS with these w/shops. Pay so much for labour yet the poor mech gets less than that a fortnight

9518 2018-01-30 03:36:13 A small price to pay for a $500+ billion Russian/Exxon oil deal that Trump was put in place to get done. Oil owns GOP. Big Oil has run the US for years.
9519 2018-01-30 03:36:11 I wonder if the same people that doubt the scientific method also skip all medications and modern medicine because the processes are imperfect. Snake oil only!
9520 2018-01-30 03:36:03 WHAT that’s weird. omg i should just have fried chicken fried in peanut oil. it would fix both cravings.
9521 2018-01-30 03:35:52 Yeah that’s Rex’s company. I am guessing this is planned and has nothing to do with tax reform.  Oil industry has gotten subsidies for years.

Global crude oil prices have started shooting up again.The price of petrol crossed Rs.75 per litre in many cities last week..even touching Rs.80.
9541 2018-01-30 03:32:27 of course!

When the corned beef gets burnt, take out the boiled pasta and boiled juice Put it in a frying pan and lightly fry it.

9595 2018-01-30 03:24:39 Obviously you have no understanding of what it means for oil companies to invest.  They are not buying stocks.  They are buying leases on property or offshore leases - oh money to the government to drill.  That creates jobs jobs jobs.

9675 2018-01-30 03:13:25 It’s no use trying to reason with a troll. A mind like a steel trap. To them oil and gas are way better. Drill baby drill, fracking, off shore, Arctic, sell off public lands, just do anything you can to get it out of the ground. We’ll worry about ramifications later. Short sited.

9708 2018-01-30 03:09:17 This is not part of any investment thesis. Just entertaining ideas about how the dollar dies. This would also be counter to short oil and long USD (wouldn’t short a SA-China deal). I do think Yuan wants to establish itself as a global player & oil dominance is part of that plan

9762 2018-01-30 03:00:13 But doesnt Exxon (and all other oil biz's) already receive billions in subsidies from the feds, aka corporate welfare?
9763 2018-01-30 03:00:08 most of the oil price is due to to supply and demand issues but not all.  Partically when you can look at certain areas of the US, and epscially when you look at electric prices
9764 2018-01-30 03:00:06 Yes important to note the huge environmental impacts of fracking and oil exploitation. Pollution, safety hazards, wildlife harm. It's not a net gain

If you want people to actually watch the award show real time, don’t put politics into it. Entertainment and politics are like oil and water...**SPOILER** they don’t mix! Doesn’t matter what side your on, it comes off as petty and repetitive.
9781 2018-01-30 02:58:02 And it’s not a face oil, but let’s not forget about Black Seed oil ladies for that tummy bloating and inflammation! Thank me later

Guess how many in Saudi Arabia... 0..but Somehow United States secalls them and Ally. The reason is we control the oil and we have military bases there
9788 2018-01-30 02:57:17 Coconut oil is old treatment for hair in south India we use regular basis
9789 2018-01-30 02:57:06 Sis only use coconut oil for the body! It’s too thick for the face, unless your skin can take it!

9797 2018-01-30 02:56:12 Somehow it feels like 2004-5 when oil seemed like the most precious commodity on planet but it did crash to $40/bbl.
9798 2018-01-30 02:56:04 a moisturizer, I usually recommend a dab of olive or coconut oil with 2-3 drops of tea tree oil to fight the bacteria build up.
9799 2018-01-30 02:56:03 @tjhunt_  hey I want to make taks, but I don’t know what oil to use? what kind do you use?
9800 2018-01-30 02:55:59 I heard about a Russian Oil Tanker parked off the coast, but didn't get the details.  I wouldn't be surprised though.  Trump owes them Bigly.
9801 2018-01-30 02:55:50 I just got a call that said 'Russians are helping us'
'Be careful, they want our oil'

I immediately hung up
9802 2018-01-30 02:55:45 i HAVE BEEN HOMELESS FOR OVER A YEAR AFTER A SCUM USING THE NAME ROB EKROFT THREATENED TO MAKE ME HOMELESS IF I DIDN'T QUIT PERUSING MY INHERITANCE OF MOTOROLA AND STANDARD OIL. MY FAMILY AND COMMUNITY HAVE REFUSED TO HELP AND I AM DESPERATE FOR YOUR HELP.
9803 2018-01-30 02:55:44 Yeah it starts with machine oil smell, then gets so much worse...
9804 2018-01-30 02:55:42 Also exfoliating 3x a week is good but I always tell ppl w/ acne to stay away from gritty exfoliants because that can cause more irritation& oil so use a natural chemical exfolliant or something with fine sugar.
9805 2018-01-30 02:55:40 Add a bit of oil after washing the rice in the pot, thank me later 
9806 2018-01-30 02:55:24  turpentine oil wow  I think I’ll stick to Young Living Essential Oils! I’m tossing this in the trash....check comments for a substitute!
9807 2018-01-30 02:55:19 Has anyone notice gas prices up 30 % . Crude oil up from $40 to $70  a barrel because  Little Man trump depleted the oil reserves which drives the cost up for the consumer & profits to Big Oil. Little Man trump taking care of the middle class . Hope you wrought in hell !
9808 2018-01-30 02:55:18 What about killing in the name of islam? Do you have guts to say something on that?Killing in the name of cow is not justified, but you should not be selective in this matter. Be neutral, be honest. Or may start mustard oil business.
9809 2018-01-30 02:54:54 Yes Rubio gone was easiest decision ever. But Teague needs an oil change.
9810 2018-01-30 02:54:49 does this mean coconut oil is naturally funny haha ba dum tss
9811 2018-01-30 02:54:45 And yes, Venezuela's economy collapsed because of "Bolivarian Socialism".  Chavez handed over control of the nation's most important industries to his cronies. Even in the midst of the oil boom oil production was DOWN in Venezuela.
9812 2018-01-30 02:54:36 tw// scars

9819 2018-01-30 02:54:12 The Congress Leadership even use Media Personnel 2 assist them with "TANIM EVIDENCE & WITNESSES A LA FAKE NEWS" following the vitalianoDOJ trademark, but they don't know that they are "frying themselves with their own cooking oil".Playing God in our Christo-Islamic culture fails.
9820 2018-01-30 02:54:11 YALL NEED TO START GIVING HEMP SEED OIL THE RECOGNITION SHE DESERVES!!! A SLEPT ON QUEEN!!

9827 2018-01-30 02:53:32 Howard Marks believes that high oil prices are here to stay as shale can’t be a substitute to fossil fuels. So why this prediction now??
9828 2018-01-30 02:53:09 No, it's the largest reserve in the world. We need oil Independence! We don't want to rely on Saudi Arabia or other foreign countries
9829 2018-01-30 02:52:56 Keren you should try essential oils ! I survived my first trimester with peppermint essential oil , you should give it a try !!
9830 2018-01-30 02:52:55 Please dude, he hasn’t done anything but hook up his oil buddies and the wealthy folks at Marlago. 32% is a historic number.
9831 2018-01-30 02:52:45 just a little oil and bbq?
9832 2018-01-30 02:52:43 Looks like different cleaners. You can put some drops of thieves oil into a spray bottle of water and it works better than anything I’ve tried. None of my family have had the flu this year. No shot either 
9833 2018-01-30 02:52:18 More backwards technology: burn oil, pollute air, pollute water and pollute soil.  It must be a republiCON agenda.  The Koch bros and Tillerson will be counting their #GreedyOldPricks
9834 2018-01-30 02:52:06 i only have one nightmare every night and its just a screenshot of that girls tweet where she says she moisturizes with coconut oil and uses olive oil for makeup remover
9835 2018-01-30 02:52:04 It's a carrier oil, it doesn't penetrate skin it just sits on it. Almond oil is that bitch.
9836 2018-01-30 02:51:59 I'm so mad at the dingdong who placed the filter on my engine, it's literally impossible to take it off without getting oil all over your arm and a bunch of other nearby things
9837 2018-01-30 02:51:57 自分の絵柄と脳内で表現したいと思ってる絵柄が食い違ってると地獄
9838 2018-01-30 02:51:50 Coconut oil probably would have worked better. 
9839 2018-01-30 02:51:40 Yes! Oil free products will make it dry and your skin will try& compensate for the dryness by over producing oil. There's lot of things you can do, you can get a light oil like sunflower and use that with a gel or foaming cleanser to get rid or oil soluble debris, use a toner...
9840 2018-01-30 02:51:39 oil paint finds a way to get on everything else besides the canvas
9841 2018-01-30 02:51:34 No shit they really is instead of taking action on Russia, letting their oil tanker come to Boston and not putting sanctions on Russia, America can see that and understand it also Trump is played by the damn Russian Humm  DAMN

9844 2018-01-30 02:51:05 I am a big coconut oil fan, I use it every day on my skin and in food. Everyone’s skincare rituals are different, I like promoting natural remedies. Take what works, leave the rest and c’est la vie
9845 2018-01-30 02:50:56 Every $10 increase in international oil prices reduces GDP by 0.2 - 0.3℅ & increases inflation by 0.2-0.3℅. This risk has increased with oil prices touching $70 a barrel.

9850 2018-01-30 02:49:41 If America is interested I foretold this moment! R. Maddow aired a report about Exxon & the Kara seas! because of sanctions Exxon was halted from working in the Kara seas there is reportedly a trillion dollars in oil in the Kara seas? & donald tillerson & putin want every penny!
9851 2018-01-30 02:49:39 @bambeco Hey Bambeco - when am I going to get the Olive Oil I was supposed to get a year ago?
9852 2018-01-30 02:49:34 I'd like to see oil clean up all of the plastic shit that litters our ocean and shores before it starts talking about "investing" in anything.
9853 2018-01-30 02:49:14 Love the smell of fresh oil on the lanes !!!! ahhhhhh
9854 2018-01-30 02:49:11 I get like small pimples my skin can be kinda oily too but I’ve noticed a lot of oil free products make it dry
9855 2018-01-30 02:49:06 <みなさんにとっての"オイル"とは何ですか⁇
9856 2018-01-30 02:48:59 If only they were fighting to defend us instead of fighting for cheaper oil. But ahh the great lie we’re to believe.
9857 2018-01-30 02:48:53 That's the neocon generals, who are running foreign policy, accomplishing one of the goals it has had since 9/11. Or have you forgotten the plan to destabilize the middle east for its oil reserves? General Wesley Clark laid it all out, look it up.
9858 2018-01-30 02:48:46 Coconut oil is fire for your skin...

Don't let them deter ya.

9861 2018-01-30 02:48:37 1/I don't think Americans are crazy people as a whole but George W. Bush's decision to plan The 9/11 "attacks" & hire a group of Muslim men to fake a series of terrorist attacks so Bush had a reason to start a "war on terror", invade Iraq, steal their oil & profit heavily from it
9862 2018-01-30 02:48:33 oil doesn't count

9867 2018-01-30 02:47:50 BC is in for some rough times ahead.  Icbc with an estimated loss of 1.3 billion in one year is just the start.  Housing is starting to slow (besides condos but that's the last kick of the can).  With oil picking up I expect many people to back up and head back to Alberta.
9868 2018-01-30 02:47:37 Jojoba oil is really the shit.
9869 2018-01-30 02:47:22 Bullshit, first control Indian Oil Prices...Cut taxes on them. Show proper uses of taxes collected. Edu and Health are in shit condition.
9870 2018-01-30 02:47:17 and if so make sure to always add the oil additive to the gas to keep it running. ;-)

9926 2018-01-30 02:40:10 Showing vulnerability is a scary thing. Wicked people take pleasure in exploiting our hurts. weaknesses, and mistakes. But God walks by, as the Samaritan did, and pours in the oil and wine. Wine for cleansing and oil for healing. Restoration is the result.  #apostolicprophetic
9927 2018-01-30 02:39:45 It’s a combination of different things! One of the most important is sweat from working out. After Kiel’s facial soap. I also sometimes use dr jarts facial milk. Also ozonated olive oil!!! So good!!!

9945 2018-01-30 02:38:00 Same, I'm obsessed. I mix it with Rosehip oil and Hyaluronic serum on my face
9946 2018-01-30 02:37:38 ppl are saying bad things about coconut oil (which I’ve heard before) but i still use it to take off makeup and then wash it off w my normal cleanser
9947 2018-01-30 02:37:37 There has been no warming since 1998.  Renewables are too  intermittent for base load power. Our entire modern society depends on oil & gas.
9948 2018-01-30 02:37:34 And let oil trader Marc Rich off the hook also. Comey has that look of integrity about him a good puppet for them to manipulate.
9949 2018-01-30 02:37:27 Conveniently today, Trump said no to the Russian sanctions, as the oil tanker docked in Boston this weekend filled with Russian gas.  Coincidence? Probably not.
9950 2018-01-30 02:37:23 No butter either. Drizzle of olive oil on bread
9951 2018-01-30 02:37:14 It's the promise of full debt relief and tens of billions in dirty RUS oil $$$. Oh, and a piss tape.

9954 2018-01-30 02:36:39 enriched flour,  sugar, soybean oil, high fructose corn syrup, salt, baking soda, soy lecithin, natural flavor, spice. That's right it's animal crackers.
9955 2018-01-30 02:36:33 おはやーん！
9956 2018-01-30 02:36:30 Just as suspected... It's mostly just oil and sugar, yet Ferrero keeps advertising it like a health food #BuyerBeware

9963 2018-01-30 02:36:06 Also less environmental regulations and restrictions. More Exxon oil rigging activities! Good thing large spills don't happen twice a year. What a win for the future of everyone

9974 2018-01-30 02:35:29 My wife bought some kind of essential oil diffuser voodoo thing. She’s currently setting it up to “diffuse” during the night. If I die in my sleep, you all know why.
9975 2018-01-30 02:35:19 We need power to pasturize the fresh tomatoes, then the paste(s) canned.
Or,pastes is "doused" with natural vegetable oil .These processes can assist to mop up the fresh tomatoes fruits and preserve them for future use thereby making tomato available all year round.
9976 2018-01-30 02:35:17 Get you a man that makes a special trip to Kroger to get coconut oil for a recipe you just saw on Facebook and then makes the recipe so you can watch #TheBachelor uninterrupted

9978 2018-01-30 02:35:10 @tedlieu @grantstern @RWPUSA @funder  yep.. rump n exon need to get that russian oil into usa.
9979 2018-01-30 02:35:10 10. To make it big in the Gilded Age the best option is to get into the railroad, oil, or steel businesses #GrindDontStop
9980 2018-01-30 02:35:08 You're right. That's why Ralph Klein reinforced the Alberta Advantage, attracted more businesses to Alberta, made Albertan middle class the richest middle class in the country, and wiped out our debt, and had Alberta leading Canada economically, all on $55 oil.....
9981 2018-01-30 02:35:05 i just used a face oil and my skin feels like it’s burning um

9984 2018-01-30 02:34:38 Avacado  oil and carrot  oil are my favs.
9985 2018-01-30 02:34:33 $/CL oil futures 64.40ish is the next area to test
9986 2018-01-30 02:34:23 Made my own body oil .. gotta learn how to add scent to it.
9987 2018-01-30 02:34:23 Paul Ryan is the problem. He sold the space where a soul should be to the highest bidder, Koch bros. He knows he’s not long for politics and now he’s setting himself up for lobbying for oil and gas at the expense of democracy and thousands of others lives. Truly despicable.
9988 2018-01-30 02:34:21 read a good book (that’s what i’m doing rn), paint/draw or try to focus your mind on any creative idea, asmr videos, take a bath with essential oil, learn new phrases in different languages. any small thing that takes lots of concentration or none at all.
9989 2018-01-30 02:34:20 What Krystalshould have invested in was a hot oil treatment #TheBachelor
9990 2018-01-30 02:34:12 น้องใครหรอ  คยองเท  ปาร์ค คงไม่ใช่จีมินนะ

9992 2018-01-30 02:33:46 How much tea tree oil are you applying though? I put 2 drops on a q-tip and it dries out my zits better than any drugstore product I've tried
9993 2018-01-30 02:33:40 He'd be fired from a pizza parlor in queens for dripping oil onto the pizzas.

9997 2018-01-30 02:33:19 If they don’t order oil and vinegar on their sandwich they the feds.
9998 2018-01-30 02:33:10 Great, more oil exploration when what we need is renewable energy thanks to climate change - back in the drought in CA with no rain in sight.  But did you see what Trump did to the solar industry?
9999 2018-01-30 02:33:01 This oil from bath and body works feels so goooddd
10000 2018-01-30 02:32:44 @jdtomlin68 INDIANAPOLIS – The Indy Eleven will play home games at Lucas Oil Stadium in 2018, their first season in the United Soccer League.
10001 2018-01-30 02:32:39 Sigh. Envision a future where USA will be stuck with containers full of petrochemical crap that no one else in the world wants. Zooming around in cars and trucks that run on oil & gas, while rest of world goes clean, alternative & healthy.
