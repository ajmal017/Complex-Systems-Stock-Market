Why didn't you inform us before polls  that you will create spaghetti lines for basic commodities

We should have made educated choices by voting for spaghetti roads

57 2018-10-22 20:07:47 I find it absolutely comedic that our gm doesn’t seem willing to part with draft picks for proven commodities? So frustrating!
58 2018-10-22 20:06:30 Clásica dependencia de commodities no renovables mientras otros están haciendo ciencia y tecnología
59 2018-10-22 20:05:08 Con crisis mundial y todo, hubo medidas anticíclicas que mantuvieron ingeniosamente el consumo interno y evitó que una recesión económica tuviera lugar. Este gobierno sigue apostando a los commodities, con sequía y un mercado mundial hostil a los productos nacionales. Un DESASTRE
60 2018-10-22 19:58:29 Los que estuvieron 12 años no lo tomaron como vos decís Kpooo, literalmente le pusieron plata a gente por lo laburar, cuando los precios de los commodities cayeron quedamos en pija con un sector inválido para trabajar y otro esquilado para mantener a los primeros
61 2018-10-22 19:54:25 So are the UK willing to allow the smuggling and loss of tax revenue that will come with that? Fuel massive one. 1000s of other commodities. Of course they won't. Just the same as the EU. Laughable position to say they won't put a border up.
62 2018-10-22 19:47:53 Naomi's intelligent & articulate commodities her detractors lack. Can't beat her with reasoned debate so attack is all they've got  hope she realises that every one of these while abhorrent is a small victory it only highlights her abilities as a strong political force.
63 2018-10-22 19:37:27 Full rebuild and having a treasure chest of draft commodities is not necessarily a bad thing.  You just have to have the right GM to make those picks matter.  As a GM McKenzie has been good overall.  Better than Davis was when he was alive!
64 2018-10-22 19:35:19 #EthicalHour #food FOOD is one of our biggest imported commodities, yet we throw away more than a third of every food item we import. That’s a huge waste of resources, and while 2bn people across the world suffer malnutrition, and one child dies every second, we need to rethink..
65 2018-10-22 19:35:04 Social media business is just programming and server maintenance. Easy to enter the market with no sole source of commodities or resources to control. Also look at some of these platforms financial reports, there is a bubble growing.
66 2018-10-22 19:33:07 NFL teams should be even more open to trading picks.  Trade unknown draft picks for known commodities.  Makes sense.  They should stop holding onto picks like they’re candy.  Not the other way around.
67 2018-10-22 19:31:25 Chinese stocks have already dropped 60 per cent over the past three years. The oil price has almost doubled over the past year. Dr Copper is around 10 per cent more expensive than a year ago. Shoumd we continue moving cash into industrial commodities/gold vs equity? #investment
68 2018-10-22 19:27:11 Commodities são por definição vendidas a preço de mercado (+/- prêmio por qualidade pela diferença do benchmark, por exemplo minério de ferro da Vale tem prêmio de pureza).
69 2018-10-22 19:24:14 What Gets to me big time is how much employers rely on our good will. They know we’re dealing with people not commodities and we can’t just down tools and walk away. WE CARE ABOUT PEOPLE Pity Employers And Government didn’t care as much as us ( I’m lucky I work in day services)
70 2018-10-22 19:14:41 Words of kindness love & understanding all commodities which are so hard to find in this world today ALL any parent can give is unconditional love and support and you give that in ambundance life will throw up many choices and dilemmas once equipped they'll be fine

78 2018-10-22 18:25:33 also like USDZAR lwr but more on commodities and china reflation rather than domestic idiosyncratic factors except that Sarb Nov hike will help anchor ZAR on ir differential perspective to bolster the carry. If anything the leadup into the elections next yr will detract from ZAR
79 2018-10-22 18:16:42 It means things are fundamentally wrong. From your bio and header you're seemingly politically biased, so I would like to state that this arguement an increase in hardship and cost of commodities, whether 40% or 100% would have not emerged if all were well.

81 2018-10-22 18:06:22 Good to see loss was limited to only -5%,  as this series was one of the most volatile one.

Though I was completely away from Equity market and trading successfully only in commodities,  but able to sense the loss incurred for fellow equity traders.
82 2018-10-22 18:00:02 Commodities: Coffee -3.60%, Natural gas -3.35%
83 2018-10-22 17:59:31 its common for commodities to trade under their production costs.
84 2018-10-22 17:48:54 Commodities: #Natural gas -2.55%, #Palladium +1.99%
Top commodity losers are Natural gas (-2.55%), Gasoline (-1.81%) and Rice (-1.59%). Gains are led by Palladium (1.99%), Cotton (1.62%) and Canola (1.39%).
85 2018-10-22 17:46:07 I don't want to straw-man your position, but in general cryptocurrency promoters have serious difficulty in understanding that networks are far more powerful than mere commodities, hence this desire for some physical backing
86 2018-10-22 17:35:56 Arnt they pollution conscious? I travel to the US thrice a year. I know their laws and fines one has to pay if they exceed pollution levels. Even cars and other commodities are fined heavily if they exceed their limits. Let’s not make this comparison.
87 2018-10-22 17:30:01 Grid. Always the measure of commodities.
88 2018-10-22 17:24:22 with good managers in 2007 we survived a global financial meltdown all commodities were affected not only oil.
89 2018-10-22 17:19:11 So when we decide our tariff schedule post-Brexit, out of 13,000 plus commodities subject to import tariffs today, which ones do you see in the British consumer interest as continuing?
90 2018-10-22 17:17:37 Não sei pq tem nego que acredita que o bolsonaro é liberal economicamente mas o cara quer aumentar o preço de alguns commodities para serem os preços "justos" ao ver dele
91 2018-10-22 17:16:19 A lot of 'alternative' economists keep complaining that Bitcoin should be pegged to a physical commodity.

How is this any different from bimetallism?!?

You're basically pegging 2 commodities to eachother, a formula with disastrous results EVERY time it's been tried in history!

94 2018-10-22 16:56:48 Empower yourself by fighting your addiction to the capitalist commodities known as drugs.
95 2018-10-22 16:55:48 Companies that I think are already doing this are Google, Apple, Tesla. The companies are not making profit off of commodities like water, gas, food. They literally are making profit off of toys and the next thing.
96 2018-10-22 16:50:06 Falling real estate price isn’t a great thing..it shows how much economy struggles...Anyways it had to correct..nothing for Govt to take claim saying I bought real estate down..it’s the largest consumer of all industrial commodities and largest job generator...
97 2018-10-22 16:49:33 If you understand the Marxist concept of commodity fetishism and how even people can be considered commodities => I like you already 
98 2018-10-22 16:45:54 Getting news of fuel prices increase.ideally not good for the govt.not a good call!

Withfuel everything will go up.pmln backed businessmen already creating irrationale inflation.
99 2018-10-22 16:45:05 O Brasil tem necessidade de saber o porque estes políticos resolveram tomar conta do País, vender tudo o que são commodities para o exterior é mais lucrativo á corrupção do que Industrializar todos estes commodities na finalidade de cuidar do povo Brasileiro
100 2018-10-22 16:43:48 There's nothing revolutionary about doing drugs, they make you addicted to capitalist commodities.
101 2018-10-22 16:42:14 Also a partial cu locks you into tariffs on which commodities and to all future changes, both up and down? British Consumer interests in lower to zero tariffs on all goods not produced in the UK ought to supercede continuing protection of mostly Continental producers

103 2018-10-22 16:38:38 @tvcnewsng #JH when fuel pump price was increased it was immediate but when it comes to workers welfare ability to pay comes in. With the increase in the price of commodities its by miracle that Nigerian workers are surviving.
104 2018-10-22 16:38:15 Que? KAKAKAKAKAAKA cara com o crescimento da China a 12% ao ano na época que o PT tava no poder, vc acha que as commodities do brasil não foram compradas tudo pela china n? Cimo a china comprava MUITO, tinha menos no mercado mundial que fez com o preço delas subissem ainda.
105 2018-10-22 16:35:55 @tvcnewsng #jh NLC should fight for better price of commodities instead of salary increment. Increase in salary will lead to an increase in food stuffs

108 2018-10-22 16:25:00 Correct, and most of that is commodities.  Now draw flow diagram of what happens as China increasingly pays CNH for commodites & offers phys gold settlement (sourced fr London & NYC only), paying particular attn to mismatch of China's commodity imports v London/NYC vault holdings
109 2018-10-22 16:24:59 I verified... It's authentic... Just letting them know about their shoddy communication... Last time @VascoDaGappah cautioned them about proofreading documents... They wrote "Commodoties" instead of Commodities.
110 2018-10-22 16:24:50 What position has happened. 
Losing 1.1bill$  in less than 2 weeks from d external reserves, Fulani masacres,  poverty, hike in price of commodities.
Is this what u call success
111 2018-10-22 16:18:45 As propostas não se sustentam, é isso. Não teremos mais a China em crescimento exponencial comprando nossas commodities.
112 2018-10-22 16:16:41 Also,Us and for that matter any country imports many commodities from other countries but they do not rename their cities to honour our leaders.Thats how globalization works.

119 2018-10-22 16:01:34 These people just want to live without violence, their government isnt giving your aid to them anyway. They are in an impossible situation.

American people became “owned” by the globalist banking system as commodities, whether we agreed or not. Both the Fed and the agreement were created by Democrats. The Democrat party has always been globalism disguised as a party that represents people. #SheepNoMore

160 2018-10-22 13:30:06 And "store of value"—while usually considered a desirable property for "money"—is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for "money" and never has been. Go ahead and trade or hoard commodities if you can and want to. That doesn't turn gold or oil into money.
161 2018-10-22 13:17:22 True. The border is a multi-billion $ business and the commodities are people and drugs. NO ONE crosses the border without paying the cartels.

239 2018-10-22 06:21:53 India's crude oil imports steady at 4.38M b/d in September versus August; up 2.1% from a year ago, according to BBG calcs of petroleum data. @business #OOTT #commodities
240 2018-10-22 06:19:24 Bright and early start. Group has had breakfast and now we are off to the Port of Antwerp to explore globalisation and conrainerisation of commodities #AGSBrussels18
241 2018-10-22 06:01:24 I feel financial sectors are more or less related the commodity sector. "Cyclical business". And yes money is a commodity and institutions that deal with money are dealing with commodities.

243 2018-10-22 05:51:09 Africa should now know that we have to stand on our feets. Developed our agriculture to feed our communities,invest in technologies that can make us process what we have ,and stop feeding our generation with imported food and basic commodities.
244 2018-10-22 05:45:36 Straight up. Using people as commodities. Sickening.
245 2018-10-22 05:20:50 On the contrary I agree with government. If any controls are implemented the result is an empowered black market like what is currently happening where u find commodities cheaper on the street than in shops.
246 2018-10-22 05:17:01 Animals are property. They are economic commodities; they have a market value. We may sentimentally value the dogs, cats, and other animals who live in our home #SentientRights #Sentience #Speciesism
247 2018-10-22 05:16:37 Animal property is, of course, different from the other property that we own in that animals, unlike cars, computers, machinery, or other commodities, are sentient and have interests- GF #SentientRights #Sentience #Speciesism
248 2018-10-22 05:12:00 Definately hurting margins. However, I see #inflation below 2% by year end.

A real possibility commodities continue to decline while rates remain at current levels or higher.

249 2018-10-22 05:06:20 The more you consume, the less you live. Commodities are the opium of the people.
250 2018-10-22 05:01:59 I'm not really into commodities. Debt products are a safe place to be in this excessive volatility. + I actually feel there's going to be a very strong rally before April 2019. New nifty highs within 3 months before/after elections.
251 2018-10-22 05:00:02 Commodities: Rice -1.77%, Natural gas -1.66%
252 2018-10-22 04:56:18 I'll be on @yourmoney a little after 4 pm to chat about markets as we head towards day's end here in Australia but as Europe is about to kick off & the US is still snoozing 

#China, #Italy, #Earnings, #Bonds, #forex, and #commodities - not much to talk about really :)

255 2018-10-22 04:21:58 Sorry commodities and stocks traders dont fail. Don’t be mad at me that all you could do in life is be an airborne infantry lmfao. Love trading oil.
256 2018-10-22 04:13:10 Did like your algorithms stats, Kerry. A dose of humour always helps a commodities report.
257 2018-10-22 04:12:47 6...of still allowing the import of rice and other food commodities. FYI, it's their jobs to criticize in the first place. Where were you when PDI-P was still the opposition party during the SBY administration for ten long years, today's editorial?

261 2018-10-22 03:02:23 Yes, I watched.
Elastic currency, otherwise known as fiat currency works most of the time. Except in depressions where commodities like gold and silver are preferred.  A wise investor backs his assets with some commodity.
262 2018-10-22 02:57:00 I traded behind a screen like it was a video game.  The big boys did deals with oligarchs and warlords, sometimes financing coups and trading commodities for weapons.
263 2018-10-22 02:37:51 @edmnangagwa Mr president you tried by all means to barricade and grow the local industry,but in turn they are back stabbing you, its high time you remove duty for basic commodities, for the benefit  of the Zimbabwean masses. Industry betrayed you, hence time 2 protect the public

265 2018-10-22 02:23:57 Market Update - Ag commodities finished the week mixed, with wheat and canola up and the others down. The AUD is little changed today.
266 2018-10-22 02:18:12 Cada vez que una kukaracha habla de la gestión kuka pasa por alto que se fumaron la mejor década de la historia en precios de commodities para dejar el gobierno con la misma cantidad de pobres y miles de nuevos corruptos. #DeboDecir
267 2018-10-22 02:15:52 “opinions are the cheapest commodities on earth. In fact, almost everyone has a flock of them ready to be foisted upon anyone who is willing to accept them.”

269 2018-10-22 02:11:05 State antitrust laws applicable to corporations but not to individuals, or to vendors of commodities but not to vendors of labor, have been upheld.
270 2018-10-22 02:10:39 "Pricing Pollution." Yes. That's the result of assigning a price to too many imaginary commodities. Very progressive of you to warn against it, Minister.
271 2018-10-22 02:10:07 Well, i only have one request boot china out of china and support the USA, and you need diversification from commodities and no carbon tax, more than one to be honest.
272 2018-10-22 02:04:54 Weight is constant...
If..... commodities are shipped as a whole! Container of tp, pizza, deodorant, etc....
You get fixed weights vs. fixing weights for the customer.
But, that doesn’t benefit the retailer...

All of a sudden rights are commodities he thinks he can buy out.
'I'll take u

You're gone too
And that's not needed anymore
And this old thing'

This is getting stupid!! #TransRightsAreHumanRights
275 2018-10-22 01:53:47 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
276 2018-10-22 01:45:36 Room for animals to stretch their legs and turn around before they are slaughtered? Factory farming is cruel and archaic. In 2018 people are still eating animal products? Prop12 should exist because animals are NOT commodities. Simple. #fact
277 2018-10-22 01:39:59 Vary of temperature and weathers in all provinces, Pakistan can produce all fruits and food commodities we are importing at cost of US$6 Bn. Why our agri research bodies are sleeping yet. A little serious attention n modern irrigation techniques are needed to apply.
278 2018-10-22 01:39:47 Nossa economia está em franco crescimento,temos tratados bilaterais con varios países ,vc fala de fechar fronteira mas se esquece da Itaipu ,esquece das commodities,temos quase 10 mil alunos brasileiros estudando medicina aqui , empresas que migraram, fechar fronteira?
279 2018-10-22 01:34:49 Kyle didn’t touch on RMB oil contract, gold, or China’s desire to buy commodities in their own currency.  Grant missed there as an interviewer although generally I think he does a great job.
280 2018-10-22 01:32:37 Remember when refugees were sad scared people we helped and for whom we had compassion?
Remember when they weren't politicized commodities to be dehumanized and weaponized to fear monger for votes?
Remember that?

284 2018-10-22 01:11:52 We are a "dust bowl" away from having plenty of ag commodities to zilch.
285 2018-10-22 01:06:40 This was the most quiet purr could be heard.

“That's good to hear, hey would you want to go do some shopping? You can't wear only your armor for the rewt of yohr life and perhaps your room can use some commodities.”
286 2018-10-22 01:05:01 Money is a commodity... not a useless token only good for exchanging;... It differs from other commodities in being demanded mainly as a medium of exchange. - Murray Rothbard
287 2018-10-22 00:54:56 Define economics? Economics is the science that deals with the production, distribution and consumption of commodities.

289 2018-10-22 00:49:40 So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check
290 2018-10-22 00:42:31 I don’t think that at all. I very well understand boom and busts of commodities, I understand exactly how market cycles work. So tell me a market that is not a whole index, that goes up and doesn’t retrace more.
291 2018-10-22 00:41:03 Commodities prices as of now: 

Spot Gold: 1,230.60

292 2018-10-22 00:38:55 I've been investing in markets for 20+ years. Imagine thinking bitcoin market cycles don't follow the same pattern as other commodities and stocks. Cycles end in a bottoming period where support is tested over and over WITHOUT breaking down.
293 2018-10-22 00:32:52 Last thing: given declining real values for commodities, as a commodity producer Malaysia’s terms of trade will decline over time. That means the Ringgit’s exchange value will also fundamentally decline over time against non-commodity currencies
294 2018-10-22 00:32:46 Drugs do not relax you, they reinforce your violent addiction to capitalist commodities.
295 2018-10-22 00:32:06 So is farming. There’s nothing intrinsically wrong with commodities and profits. It’s how the world feeds itself.
296 2018-10-22 00:07:24 Uber doesn’t need to replicate any of that. That’s the point. Cars can become pure commodities, like Android handsets.
297 2018-10-22 00:03:17 Chinga urigaro. If we have enough fuel in the country no one will supply or buy from black market.
