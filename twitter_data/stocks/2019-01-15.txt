2 2019-01-15 23:56:29 Jim, I follow you and remember in December when you said that when the sell off was done that the rebound would take off with the stocks that “have no fleas”,,,NetFlix & Amazon should really soar near term as the ETFs jump on board@
3 2019-01-15 23:55:56 We had some in our retirement stocks. Sold. Will use funds to day trade and hopefully build up our account more.
4 2019-01-15 23:55:36 Marj stocks up this year thus far. 2019 looking good. Time to look elsewhere. Took some $DIGAF @.0056. Sitting on support. Exchange news expected any moment. No brainer here.

GOOD NEWS... GO BUY STOCKS!
8 2019-01-15 23:54:04 That's great news! Crowd was only thing I didn't like about this short. 

Probably many shorts lost margin during the minor dip in stocks into late December.  Happy to see them go.

10 2019-01-15 23:50:19 Back to late ‘15/early ‘16 all over again.  

This is a terrible business. It never really generates FCF....unless they stop exploration to replace reserves...and then the top line growth stops...and then the stocks tank.

GOOD NEWS... GO BUY STOCKS
12 2019-01-15 23:48:45 Buying stocks is not “banking” money. It’s risking money. Again if the company (stock) value tanks. They loose it all. A stock buy back shows faith in the economy. And a stronger economy is the exact goal of the tax cuts.

Hard to watch the other weed stocks excell, and get large corporation partnerships, while WE WAIT FOR A FUCKING REBUTTAL!!

VIC JUST LEAVE YOU CRIMINAL!!
14 2019-01-15 23:48:27 Bitcoin is not in a bubble & never was. There are 337,000 BTC addresses holding $10,000 or more. Since most people own more than one address that’s a lot less than 337,000 people. But there are approximately 1B people who own stocks. How many people in the world own real estate?
15 2019-01-15 23:47:35 Transitioning from high risk no yield investments to tons of cash flow investments is a 3-5 year process it seems.

Slowly unwind out of long-term 5-10 year positions to buy boring stuff like Bonds, Homes and high yield stocks

Rich people problems
16 2019-01-15 23:47:23 Can someone run my @Tinder & @Bumble accounts for me? Or like a team of people? Like, I'm the CEO and I need a Board of Directors because right now the current administration is bringing the stocks down. I built this company with my two hands and I have nothing to show for it
17 2019-01-15 23:47:17 I remember when fortune cookies had a little saying and done. Now it is like a weather report, stocks, and relationship advice all on one piece of paper.
