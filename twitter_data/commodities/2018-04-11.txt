42 2018-04-11 19:51:14 Bitcoin has no protections against self-trading like regular commodities do. So we can't tell if the increased volume is real or just one or two people trading against themselves to puff up the numbers.

156 2018-04-11 12:46:18 Thanks for sharing. There are layers of goodness there. Commodities displace commodities. And also sometimes traders get a bad wrap, but this is a direct example of how their ingenuity brings value directly to the US farmer.

Unless some absurd economic measures of recent past has had lingering unintended consequences that cant be hidden anymore
228 2018-04-11 05:25:23 I naively shared that sentiment about precious metals, rare earths, commodities....clearly this is different, this is Tech, however currency debasement threat, gov, manipulation, a lot of similarities, which Keeps me only Luke warm on this crypto outlook vs absolutely sold
229 2018-04-11 05:11:38 Not really how the global market works. 'Independence' isn't a thing for commodities or goods

231 2018-04-11 05:03:01 Oil and gas are commodities of trade, but are also of necessity. Energy is essential for all sectors of the economy: PM @narendramodi at the 16th #InternationalEnergyForum Ministerial Meeting
232 2018-04-11 05:00:46 And, what is the alternative? Carrying your own bottles? Do you have a solution transporting essential commodities like Milk, curd or grains? instead on keep talking about plastic is bad! Use your influence to place a mechanism for waste segregation, management & recycling.
233 2018-04-11 05:00:01 Commodities: Wheat -0.81%, Gasoline -0.79%
234 2018-04-11 04:53:34 Who cares, those that are used as commodities all feel pain and fear.
235 2018-04-11 04:50:14 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
236 2018-04-11 04:44:43 Greenpeace is sophisticated enough to know the consequences of removing palm oil. Not so, the public. Move deforestation advocacy to the MEGA deforesting commodities as well. Too difficult to ban BEEF? or DAIRY products? Have they done much "cleaning up" of supply chains?
237 2018-04-11 04:38:56 Kotak should launch Total return funds where asset manager can invest in any asset class reit, gold, equity, bonds, commodities. Real test of active management.
238 2018-04-11 04:32:12 I read one of his earlier versions of this article and some tweets and he said we would have a shared military and open trade between the countries for commodities. It was pretty fascinating. We would be happy I just don’t know if they would ever leave us alone.
239 2018-04-11 04:22:06 What do you mean they are only animals.  What do you think you are? They are sentient beings with feelings, brain and nervous system just like you.  They just look different and communicate differently.  They don't deserve to be used as commodities 
240 2018-04-11 04:15:09 -until yesterday however when the chinese have decided to be a little more reciprocative in terms of less tariffs on not only commodities but now vehicles and other high tech products plus added protection on IP security -cheers well done china. More to come hopefully!

242 2018-04-11 04:00:23 Earnings growth, in line with @eastcapital expectations. 50% of Chinese companies have now reported 2017 results. Total FY17 profit up by 27% yoy. Non-financial sectors did far better, +53%. Strongest sectors: energy (240%), commodities (116.9%), property (84.3%) and IT (58%).
243 2018-04-11 03:46:56 Commodities are scarce. In a situation where water or food is scarce, that scarcity must be managed. A free market is one such way.  In a situation where water and food are not scarce, but the free market artificially creates that scarcity, withholding abundance of basic....

245 2018-04-11 03:33:43 Why are you putting an emphasis on these animals dying from a relatively minor cause when 3 out of 4 of the species shown are slaughtered and sold as commodities to be consumed?
246 2018-04-11 03:29:06 Doesn't matter.  They are only commodities/components of commodities.  The market decides what they are "worth"  #PASPA @CFTC @FINRA @SEC_News @AmerGamingAssn

252 2018-04-11 03:06:45 The rituals of buying and selling and the belief that life is mostly about participating in the production and consumption of commodities function like *primitive* religous ritual and dogma.   Let me unpack that a bit....
253 2018-04-11 03:06:36 I dunno, feels like apples (online actions, which are commodities, like it or not) and oranges (social media, from which you can opt out).

Privacy norms & methods exist which can always be improved, will always be abused or exploited, & are least effective via govt regulation

256 2018-04-11 02:45:17 If it sells commodities it’s an ad campaign 
257 2018-04-11 02:42:50 Good grief, they are happy to reference, and compare, the alleged tulip craze, but they don't extrapolate #btc price trends over a few years. I wonder how that market analysis methodology is going for them in shares and commodities.
258 2018-04-11 02:32:55 But where is the mehengai???
Nearly all commodities are below than 1st May 2014..
If we take the inflation in to account @7.5% per annum the prices must have gone up by 30% in these 4 year..but it is still below that bench mark price..
259 2018-04-11 02:30:35 Yang minimal nyo malaking impact na yan sa mahihirap amp! Nagtaasan na mga presyo ng basic commodities wala namang dagdag sa kita!
260 2018-04-11 02:30:14 Actually it’s not at all weird. That “product” is a group of 25 young men, not commodities that are bought and sold at market. That makes it possible to support the “product” while vilifying the one putting the product on the field.
261 2018-04-11 02:24:34 I heard that if energy and commodities are leading in the markets, then that's a sign that the market is leading up to a crash soon.  Would you agree @CiovaccoCapital ?
262 2018-04-11 02:13:03 There’s only so much Californians can bear. Californians are hurting from highest gas prices in the Nation. The State incurs highest inflation rate from utilities, rentals, commodities, taxes, licenses and fees. Geez! Changes to RED!
263 2018-04-11 02:12:41 We need a return to government commodities. Enough of this nonsense about food stamps being used to purchase $100 worth of steaks.
264 2018-04-11 02:07:48 Oh weird I was under the impression that people entered into contracts to sell their labor. I guess they only sell commodities?

266 2018-04-11 02:02:00 Body Modification is a key biopolitical nexus between humans bodies as commodities under capitalism and advertising in late modernity. Are individuals empowering themselves or socially conforming? Richard Wolfe argues it's a corporate straitjacket. @rpatulny #soc344uow18#Bbay
267 2018-04-11 01:50:52 We want trading opportunities in commodities that won't kill the planet with #climatechange. #Clean #Renewables are our future.

272 2018-04-11 01:32:28 1/ Installing tariffs on commodities production where the US is a tiny fraction of global production, is the worst kind of @GOP trickle-down betrayal. It’s a few thousand upstream jobs compared to the millions of end-customers where costs are passed down.
273 2018-04-11 01:24:50 Yes it was a good investment but there are new cryptocurrencies coming up now that could have a similar appreciation but it depends on a lot of different factors. Diversifying a portfolio between stocks bonds real estate commodities currencies is a good strategy

276 2018-04-11 01:07:48 This isn’t about whether you like #Zuckerberg personally or not. This is a landmark moment for privacy and data rights. We have to decide whether our actions online are commodities to be bought & sold, or matters of privacy.
277 2018-04-11 01:02:58 Yeah, right, blah blah blah. If you and all the other politicians had even an ounce of goodness, you would stop using our military as private mercenaries for companies that want to control commodities around the world.
278 2018-04-11 00:57:11 Sabes xq no me correponde? Porq nosotros competimos con prod agrop de otros paises ( eeuu brasil europa australia, etc) q no tienen retenciones, y el precio de los commodities es el mismo y el precio de los insumos son lo mismo. A pesar de eso aumentamos produccion para el pais

283 2018-04-11 00:24:13 Cows are very affectionate but the Dairy and Agriculture lobbyists don’t want you to think of them as sentient beings. Instead, Factory Farmers want you to see them as emotionless commodities, resources to be used up.  Same way China views its cats and dogs: use for food and fur.

they're competitors because they exist in the same competitive space, not b/c they are interchangeable commodities.
