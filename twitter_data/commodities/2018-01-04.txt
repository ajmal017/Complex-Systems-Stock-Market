44 2018-01-04 21:57:05 I don't know the finer details of the CAP but it says it's paid per acre, not by quantity of animals. Furthermore, this is more about ensuring the livelihoods of thousands of people (not to mention consumers) with prices for products and commodities being hammered and unstable

We tax citizens to fight enforce war.

47 2018-01-04 21:43:58 Ripple is being used by banks in Japan. But it isn’t a currency (nor are any of the other blockchain payment systems like bitcoin). They are more like commodities than currencies
48 2018-01-04 21:42:38 Still see 70cents but for now strong global growth and flow on to commodities and still soft $US are dominating the deterioration in the gap between Aust and US interest rates...so risk is it goes higher before heading down

63 2018-01-04 21:02:25 La baja en el costo financiero en dólares y los precios de los commodities sostenidos ayudan en el corto plazo a financiar un TCR de "equilibrio" más bajo frente a la presión que ejerce el déficit fiscal y la señal de tasa del BCRA para bajar infla.

79 2018-01-04 19:34:56 I think of prices as measures of market-wide desirableness. Like with people, some highly-desired companies (or commodities, currencies, etc.) turn out to have only a shallow appeal. A price increase isn't exactly a reward, just evidence that something is gathering attention ATM.

91 2018-01-04 19:02:49 Adversely the more we charge for commodities the more we create commercial competitions which affects the quality for us as consumers. Exhibitions, museums all fall under entertaining and culture and deserve to change for the expenses incurred.

93 2018-01-04 18:55:18 People are commodities in politics. Respect is temporal. De Lille's shelf life is expired. I have a personal view on De Lille, but this is not the time or the place. I do, however, prefer that she departs.
94 2018-01-04 18:51:00 It's not huge, I didn't say that. But there has been an increase in the cost of living that isn't reflected in the official data. That's all. A rise in commodities would make that worse, obviously.

115 2018-01-04 17:26:49 An important component of the value of commodities/currencies such as gold, or diamonds or other precious metals is scarcity. 

Being able to print additional currency without consequence destroys the scarcity component of it, and leads to or results in the collapse of its value
116 2018-01-04 17:26:02 I remember late 2006 and early 2007 very well. The situation is very different from then. Few care, but commodities and price structure in other world markets makes it very clear where we are headed. #Dow30k #Trumpmarket

For decades we have had perverse tax incentives which have turned homes into commodities, the lack of building affordable homes is the issues, selling off council housing stock with

125 2018-01-04 16:50:21 Fanny Freddy was part of the problem. Without it the economy still would have blown. You need to go back to the Commodities Futures Modernization Act. Clinton may have signed it but only Graham and his cronies would have had any idea what it would do.

Bus drivers and conductors strike - Govt accepts to revise salary - Bus fare increases - IT employees go on strike to raise salary for steep increase in prices of essential commodities - Eventually company throws them out.
134 2018-01-04 16:41:21 Well stocks are bullish. Macroeconomic data should see stocks rise. But oil and commodities are a different story. Good Macro data doesn't mean the data on those rise. I'll defend the rise in stocks, but NOT the rise in oil.

He forced banks to provide sub prime mortgages to low income families that eventually couldn't pay them, resulting in those mortgages being grouped and sold as commodities.

167 2018-01-04 15:17:12 Butter world prices are up. Most basic foodstuffs are commodities and traded worldwide. That keeps overall prices down. Only Venezuela has tried to ignore that.

218 2018-01-04 13:10:07 No, they aren't backed by commodities. Usually what makes a currency strong is the perceived ability or willingness of the average debtor to repay their debt to the central bank which means nothing really

232 2018-01-04 12:23:28 TR/AIN law is anti poor. Icb the admin economists didnt even try to think how this will affect the paying poor. The buying power will lessen due to higher taxes on commodities. Right, no more taxes on wages but high as fck taxes on basic commodities. Let's not even start with
233 2018-01-04 12:11:53 Increasing the Minimum wage has not led to price increases. What has led to price increases is Austerity sucking the money out of Peoples pockets, The stagnation and decline of wages and the greed of large Corporations who want to charge more and more money for basic commodities.
234 2018-01-04 12:03:13 Well not exactly. We import the most German cars as commodities, but we don't actually buy the most, despite our massive population. But a deal will be made, however as it's impossible for it to be as good economically as we have now, something will have to give somewhere.
235 2018-01-04 11:57:26 Good global growth is boosting commodities, sending dollars to the far corners of the earth thereby weakening the dollar which is sapping the commodity company rally in rands. Nice problems to have.

Answer: INFLATION, Higher commodities & Int Rates
What stimulus remains if shocked by Terror or war?

247 2018-01-04 10:45:20 Poor people disproportionately use more of their income on commodities. (Even millionaires can only consume so much and they horde much of their wealth rather than put it back into the economy.) The new tax is going to hit the poor the worst. #IfYouDieImSorry

250 2018-01-04 10:14:30 With respect, Norway is 90% odd of EFTA. It is a small country (1/9th size GDP 1/11th popularion -exporting mainly commodities not produced elsewhere in EU. Also, Norway goes beyond EU requirements. EFTA would not exist as it does with 2nd/3rd largest in it.
251 2018-01-04 09:55:19 You probably have to take art and other commodities into account as well. And then there's the grey area, such as loopholes in regulations and shadowy legal constructions ... not sure how to define all of that, or where to start.
252 2018-01-04 09:54:35 Only have to look at Chinese monthly import figures to see the real demand for commodities. Add to that global manufacturing is going from strength to strength.

283 2018-01-04 06:49:44 well, no taxes for a certain salary range, plus additional taxes on some commodities (like gas). pero paano na yung walang taxes to begin with? saan sila kukuha ng pambuno sa pagtaas ng mga bilihin?

294 2018-01-04 05:57:03 I have the same thot as well but mine has to do with the prices of commodities. They have allowed prices to be hiked for them to reduce them and make it look like there is progress.

296 2018-01-04 05:28:08 But won't there be capital depreciation if say we have reached the bottom of the interest rate cycle ? Oil & other commodities are going up, inflation has stopped going down.
297 2018-01-04 05:24:45 How about those who do not have any income? Or at most do not have a stable income? How will they cope up with an increase in basic commodities?
298 2018-01-04 05:23:34 The basic question is: will the higher savings from increased exemptions enough to cover the rise in prices of consumer goods and basic commodities?

317 2018-01-04 03:15:19 Yes, higher take home pay means people have more to spend. But that’s just the basic way of looking at it. The more pressing question siguro is would the increase in the net take home pay suffice to cover the concurrent increases in prices of commodities because of the TRAIN.
318 2018-01-04 03:12:29 But the social benefits presented do not address the issues on the adverse impact of the higher cost of commodities relative to the financial capacity of low-income households no?

334 2018-01-04 02:21:03 The number of hours worked per week declined from about 80 hours/week in 1900 to ~40/wk in 1960. It has held fairly steady since.  The amount of time needed to afford an hour of light at night and many other commodities has dropped immensely over the centuries.
335 2018-01-04 02:17:57 Basically those who are earning minimum wage will not gain in the tax exemption because they are already exempted. But since prices of commodities will increase then lalo silang kakapusin.
336 2018-01-04 01:23:27 Any downside would likely be limited to the point of irrelevance. Commodities and price structure in other world markets is suggestive of 'straight up' to sp'3k, rather than any serious threat. I see any shorts as largely pointless.
