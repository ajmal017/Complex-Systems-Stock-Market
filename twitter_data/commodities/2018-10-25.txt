38 2018-10-25 22:23:55 Bitter sulphuric smell. Those caps were precious commodities.
39 2018-10-25 22:21:15 Buy Dec. Corn at 360 3/4 as it is very oversold short-term for a short-covering rally. Raise buy-back on Dec. Oats to 281 a bushel to take a profit.

40 2018-10-25 22:20:34 Who mentioned commodities. Someone said they wanted all government out of their lives. I would assume that meant state local federal whatever. Also why do yu red people always use name calling. Do yu do that in yur regular life?

43 2018-10-25 21:58:24 I grew up super poor. Food stamps, commodities, church food.

I keep about six months of food in my house for two reasons.
1. It helps me sleep and know I will never be hungry again.

2. It helps me give folks a couple weeks worth of food without a thought.

46 2018-10-25 21:44:09 Mom (Dodgers fan) is complaining about the practice of changing the starting lineup based on who is scheduled to pitch. Purely from an entertainment point of view, the World Series just seems like the wrong time to treat your players as interchangeable commodities.

48 2018-10-25 21:30:28 (1) Ações, renda fixa, moedas e commodities são instrumentos para negociar os ativos básicos de uma economia, como ativos de empresas, unidades monetárias emitidas pelo governo e recursos naturais como petróleo e ouro. #CFA
49 2018-10-25 21:29:58 El precio de los commodities no tiene nada q ver con la politica argentina, son precios internacionales. Si suben o bajan no depende del Estado, no confundamos a la gente q se enoja con quien no debe hacerlo.
50 2018-10-25 21:27:47 Usando videozinho do racista Willian Waak e da ultra conservadora Eliane Cantanhede para criticar o plano econômico do Haddad? Ah, vá se informar. Não sabe nem o que são commodities.
Corrupção começa a se combater no cidadão, ok? Preste atenção.
51 2018-10-25 21:27:16 Não tem nada a ver com que eu perguntei a você, mas é importante saber disso. Com seus videos aprendi que um país pode ser rico independente de exportar só commodities ou não. Continue assim, porque assim como eu, outras pessoas podem aprender com você o que eu aprendi.
52 2018-10-25 21:25:26 Bakit may control ba tayo sa pagtaas ng bilihin sa market? Like oil? Hindi maganda dahil nagtataas ang bilihin pero di namn tayo self sufficient eh, inaangkat natin yong mga ibang commodities..
53 2018-10-25 21:24:54 I asked @andrew_leach via Twitter whether any other industries (other than oil) that ship commodities from Vancouver have to assess the impact on marine mammals.  Still waiting for an answer.

55 2018-10-25 21:17:27 Are commodities a place than perform in a sell off of this sort?

Obviously the global growth story is shot but where does the money coming out of the market run to?

63 2018-10-25 20:44:18 Le doy mi punto de viste usted tómelo o déjelo, Necesitamos construir trabajo y sumarle producción a los commodities, pero nuestra producción es cara, vale entonces solicitar urgente una zona franca en puerto madryn para liberar de impuesto la producción de esas materias primas..
64 2018-10-25 20:43:13 Explique em detalhes isso. Paulo Guedes quer tornar o Brasil simples exportador de commodities, acabar com investimentos em infra-estrutura, educação e saúde. Como fazer o pais crescer assim???? A não ser q queiram mão de obra barata e elite rentista.
65 2018-10-25 20:41:09 Uranium is a buy for me. It's in a 2-year downtrend and is nearing the end I think.

Also keep an eye on commodities. There will soon be a lot of capital going between investments and a lot of uncertainty. Invest with a plan and  extreme caution

67 2018-10-25 20:19:35 I never wear any makeup anyway... Purely cause I can't afford commodities and have very sensitive skin.
68 2018-10-25 20:16:21 Spending power will increase and price of commodities will very likely follow it.
69 2018-10-25 20:13:05 But they can't. Their centrally managed economy will NEVER be able to produce enough of the right combination of commodities for their population.  Customers for life.
70 2018-10-25 20:07:04 Es el mismo problema que pasan todos los commodities que produce cualquier País del mundo, por eso se necesitan productos y servicios con valor agregado que generen más valor en el mercado.
71 2018-10-25 19:59:47 No, no, get DC out, and STOP IT. All private commodities!!!!!!!
72 2018-10-25 19:55:02 That’s the POINT. Minimum wage jobs were not designed for that! Now you understand that, even if they did raise the wage, guess what happens? Prices for commodities and stuff go up because now they have to cover the raised amount they’re paying! Then the cycle continues again
73 2018-10-25 19:50:31 1. #Quantfury offer traditional capital markets, forex markets, commodities and have zero fees/commissions. Existing trading platforms take advantage of retail traders and Quantfury is here to change that.
74 2018-10-25 19:50:18 Veganism has nothing to do with clean-eating or personal purity. It's about rejecting the view that nonhuman animals are mere commodities, pieces of property, items of stock or units of production, and trying to avoid causing them harm in situations where it's reasonably possible
75 2018-10-25 19:39:27 Change your Business Model in order to enable customers to “rent, share and return” as opposed to “buy, own and dispose” of commodities #circulareconomy
76 2018-10-25 19:34:45 Isn't "...but it did have a culture where problems festered because too many players feared speaking out." the definition of a toxic culture? Note to the NCAA & Universities: These are human beings, not replaceable commodities.
77 2018-10-25 19:30:24 Industrial commodities is what I'm watching for as signs of a pickup in China. Sometimes they bottom with manufacturing and trade data but usually a little bit before
78 2018-10-25 19:30:02 See most of Europe, including Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, Germany, France... they socialize basic services & privatize commodities. That's what we want, not state run socialism of all businesses. 

Also Medicare is socialism & works great.

88 2018-10-25 18:31:00 It’s actually really funny you used to be a commodities trader. I’m an attorney who advises commodity traders on the desk of an international investment bank. Like the CEA and CFTC are my areas of expertise. 
89 2018-10-25 18:27:50 In a case of a can of peas or carrots, the company is responsible for correcting the error, but the analogy only goes so far since people aren't commodities like canned vegetables are.
90 2018-10-25 18:26:41 As good an idea as themed donations are it can sometimes mean there can be an excess of some commodities and shortages of other much needed items.
91 2018-10-25 18:26:23 Will be interesting to see how the die hard Brexit faithful sit with the notion of paying through the nose for over engineered commodities that are made in Singapore by the subsidy-milking largest private landowner of the UK, to avoid paying tax & wages in Britain.
Sovereignty!
92 2018-10-25 18:25:41 No opinion on commodities in general... all I know is when u get the best names in the world on sale you have to pounce
93 2018-10-25 18:23:41 Trading in Equity (F&O) is quite risky, but here u made 10% is considered huge in earning at Equity (F&O). 

But I will say, having enormous knowledge, u can shift ur focus in commodities side only in base metals for even higher rate of returns with less investment and less risk
94 2018-10-25 18:20:14 I was a commodities trader. Don’t countries sell and export their products in the global economy?  When was the last time the US conquered a country in Africa or South America for its resources. You watch too many movies.

Asian equities remained under the pump, but Europe & US shook off negativity with a reasonable rebound - tech led the charge; commodities also saw upside, oil recovering by 1%; #NZD continued to be bogged down by #USD strength, though avoided a dip below 0.6500 - just.

102 2018-10-25 18:02:53 Yeah and while he's at it he should just sell off one or two of the children he has right, I mean they are valuable commodities that he's just not exploiting correctly... God you're dense...
103 2018-10-25 18:01:14 Qualquer um que entende o quanto o preço das commodities influencia em nossa economia, sabe que até o Boulous iria fazer um bom governo naquela época. PT e Lula aproveitaram pra desviar mais de 80bi e enviar 50bi pra fazer obras em países de esquerda. PT NUNCA MAIS
104 2018-10-25 18:00:12 Surely Lucy most know that when a country does less trade it’s trade weighted currency tumbles, and Minford said Brexit will end British manufacturing which means less trade, a free falling currency means imported inflation
We import majority of our basic commodities
105 2018-10-25 17:59:17 I’m not sure where the narrative of draft picks over proven commodities came from but it’s flawed logic. Simply look at the wide receivers of the last three years and a drive-by analysis will leave anyone unimpressed. I’d draft him in the first round in 2019 based on need.
106 2018-10-25 17:56:03 Commodities about to have a kick ass cycle.
107 2018-10-25 17:55:49 Capitalism has ruined the environment. It has devastated and enslaved entire populations. It separates us as people and dehumanizes us, turning our lives into mere commodities to be used. It is deceptive and tricky. It keeps people compliant by offering hope and threatening death

112 2018-10-25 17:40:22 “There is..pressure to turn thoughts into commodities..ideas that are profitable rather than compelling for their own sake. To give in to this pressure,to enter the business world’s domain of language and assumptions is in effect to surrender.”

123 2018-10-25 16:54:18 Which could lead to aggregate wage growth.

142 2018-10-25 15:56:02 True.  All it needs to do is stop buying USTs (which it did in 2013) and then begin to price commodities in its own currency, and then not get in a military confrontation.  Compounding interest will do the rest.

152 2018-10-25 15:16:18 Long overdue. Also monitor foreigners who are travelling here to buy basic commodities at a low price

161 2018-10-25 14:53:20 There are a ton of assets and commodities you can move cash to that are undervalued and way less volatile as crypto. Institutional traders aren't going to be throwing large amounts of capital at bitcoin right now. Maybe one day.

164 2018-10-25 14:50:19 This is the brutal reality of consuming animal products. The animals are viewed as commodities,  not living creatures so when their "useful life" ends, they must be destroyed in order to save the expense of caring for the animal in its non-productive years. So heartbreaking.
165 2018-10-25 14:49:19 I meant to say..like invaluable commodities...
166 2018-10-25 14:44:40 If you’re going to invest in Cryptocurrency, invest in it. 

If you’re going to invest in

Invest in them. 

Why wrap a stable coin around them and create perceived stability.

177 2018-10-25 14:13:55 it's already in play, the market has lost all its gain for the last year, even with record breaking stock buybacks, inflation is looming, the market is still bloated, and the current glut of commodities will be gone next year so food prices will soar.  we are headed for hell.

196 2018-10-25 13:17:28 The SEC has approved ETFs for commodities other than bitcoin that are traded on unregulated markets around the world, like gold, silver & oil.

I'd love to see a study comparing them to bitcoin to see if they really trade so differently. If not, the VanEck ETF should be approved.

There is no integrity?
213 2018-10-25 12:02:00 Good move but I don't think there will be a change because basic commodities are sold at US dollar rate

216 2018-10-25 11:53:50 Not just pugs. A whole range of dogs have been bred for a KC aesthetic rather than healthy breeds. Just look at the British Bulldog now compared to 100 years ago (serious breathing issues) and GSDs (spinal issues) etc. People treat animals as commodities and it's vile.
217 2018-10-25 11:53:34 I believe Kenya can create more employment opportunities if we do value addition on what we can produce locally. Especially on agricultural commodities such as sisal, coffee, tea etc
218 2018-10-25 11:47:03 In my opinion, in times of a sovereign debt crisis it is wise to safeguard your investments, by purchasing commodity linked investments. Information aggregators are also commodities. Opportunities in emerging markets that have been hit hard. Think creatively & don’t get boxed in.

221 2018-10-25 11:33:14 There was a reason that precipitated the action. Government was subsidizing commodities, and many of them were being priced out of the rich of common people. Mainly due to hoarding by market distributors, custom officers (ATIKUlate comes to mind) etc.

234 2018-10-25 10:21:04 No one is against Tradermoni. It's parading them like commodities by our politicians that many opposed. How many of those owing these massive debts were used for publicity when they were being handed their money. All we were saying is that a little bit of dignity won't go amiss
235 2018-10-25 10:16:59 Money has reduced men into commodities for weak minded women. I'm more than a broke man,look beyond the material.
236 2018-10-25 10:14:50 Actually alot of the jobs that paid a dollar or two more couldn't afford to pay more then minimum so it could've been a hit or miss for you and their that thing called inflation so your raise will be lost due higher priced commodities
237 2018-10-25 10:11:33 I wish I was as confident as you are. There are a great number of UK companies that will be dirt cheap after #NoDeal Brexit & very vulnerable to take-over Property prices will be depressed & you will be able to buy commercial property for peanuts. This isn't all about commodities
238 2018-10-25 10:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
239 2018-10-25 10:06:25 Basta dizer que uma das metricas mais utilizadas para venda (avaliação) de ativos (principalmente de commodities) é EV/Ebitda. Outro excelente indicador é o FCFE (pra mim o melhor), que é de fat quando sobrou para o acionista.
240 2018-10-25 10:03:58 Ebitda tem que saber fazer a leitura. Pode ser uma grande pegadinha (e muitas vezes é), mas é um bom prox. da geração op. de caixa. LL é sempre muito distorcido, princip. quando tratamos de empresa de commodities que normalmente tem divida em outra moeda, o que gera var. camb
241 2018-10-25 09:58:17 You do realise some states aren't willing to even pay the 18k wage right? Or r u asking d FG to pay 4 all d other tiers? Seeing as not everyone works 4 gov't, if d increase occurs, how do u plan 2 manage d prizes of commodities, cuz they r definitely going 2 skyrocket?
242 2018-10-25 09:53:05 To reiterate, those are the areas which skew the national average (look up Nunavut food prices). Then compound that number by the factor that food prices increase along with all commodities produced in Canada for everyone else, including your complacent metropolitan friends
243 2018-10-25 09:52:36 Same here. Enough action in commodities and currencies at the moment to keep me busy. At the moment, my plan is to buy LEAPS puts and/or put spreads on the $SPX if we get a bounce into y/e and to be aggressive with profit taking.
244 2018-10-25 09:51:52 Has there been a time in the history of Nigeria when the prices of housing or commodities or services has reduced progressively, irrespective of the govt in power, apart from Yar ' Adua who reduce petrol price?
245 2018-10-25 09:48:54 There are two Liquid Commodities that any sitting President MUST keep low if he wants to stay up in the polls and give his party a boost during #MidTerms - #Gasoline and #Milk- #Trump is blackmailing the Saudis, keeping oil low and Congress voted in Farm Subsidies for cow farmers
246 2018-10-25 09:47:54 Abolish drugs from your life and you will feel less dependent on capitalist commodities.
247 2018-10-25 09:38:26 "labor becomes invisible in the age of new media and video games,
especially when the production of the commodities that we have a fetish for
unfolds in the lands of the ‘‘other’’" (Ergin Bulut)
248 2018-10-25 09:36:30 And they will sell their commodities at 1:1 ,yah surely u are reviving this economy
249 2018-10-25 09:34:28 Really so will u give them forex to import the commodities
250 2018-10-25 09:32:03 Invest in assets that gain value. Invest in Monetary Assets like Bitcoin, Foreign exchange. Invest in stock markets and commodities like oil and gold, you will never regret. Don't just open an investment account with Absa or any bank, but buy Shares and be the bank shareholder
251 2018-10-25 09:16:06 That is disputed by the video evidence I posted in another tweet. Cooking oil was there n absolutely no queues were there n nobody was even buying cooking oil, same as bread n other commodities like sugar which are reportedly not available. I can't speak any fuel for now.
252 2018-10-25 09:11:55 them) will actually have the opposite effect and make food cheaper or more available? While the price of commodities produced in Canada increases consequentially?

Bear in mind the studies' authors said that they didn't even have the quality of data to influence policy changes
253 2018-10-25 09:09:14 I honestly feel so. Commodities up as well.
254 2018-10-25 09:06:42 $GC $BZ $CL commodities r going down the toilet
255 2018-10-25 09:03:14 Can we change the fintech world by jumping from "smoke&mirrors backed" #cryptocurrencies into similar tech forms that are backed by palpable commodities as being trees, fresh water, cannabis, minerals,...?

257 2018-10-25 08:55:18 Owen Jones‘s rant about human rights violations in Saudi Arabia would carry more weight were it not for his support for Corbyn, a man who took money from the Iranian regime that hangs gays from cranes and treats women like commodities. Selective outrage.

259 2018-10-25 08:35:44 What wise step sir?
Maharashtra environment minister said they are also thinking about banning chemical fertilizers. 
They just want to ruin agriculture to distribute cheap commodities for their urban salaried voters.
260 2018-10-25 08:31:30 Thanks @AdemOzirmak. Do you track commodities at all through your charting?
261 2018-10-25 08:22:42 Will we soon be importing food and commodities from Russia, for the lack of viable alternatives?  Forget crossing the channel and send everything via the Arctic Circle?
262 2018-10-25 08:10:03 So in Ghana , price of commodities never goes down. It only does if it’s expired.

264 2018-10-25 07:55:57 where will these shops get the foreign currency to import the commodities? I doubt RBZ has. So they will have to get it from the black market, so those imported items will be sold at black market rate........

266 2018-10-25 07:48:55 Children are not commodities to be bought and sold according to income. Many wealthy parents happily farm out their children to nannies whereas hard working devoted mums/dads are forced to work for too many hours. #UniversalCredit
267 2018-10-25 07:46:52 You are right, shortage of commodities is not the actual problem. If forex is there,we will not get that

Actually, I'm shit at them too.

This negotiation isn't going well...
273 2018-10-25 07:19:33 Could be the start for commodities to be fair
274 2018-10-25 07:15:28 Well done,
But how does the increase of import commodities ease prices when they're procured by foreign currency which is scarce and running amok? 
How much effort are we making in increasing local production & agricultural output, small scale- quick wins as livestock, vegetables
275 2018-10-25 07:08:18 About 170 illegal foreign currency dealers have been arrested as police intensify a campaign against  currency trading which caused volatility in the prices of basic  commodities and they pose a serious security and economic  threat to the country.

284 2018-10-25 06:07:36 Good short term measure.  But we need more long term solutions..we need production in the economy so that our shops are filled once again with Zimbabwe produced goods not South African commodities.

   Numerous Shopkeepers or essential commodities were checked. violators were booked and fined on spot.
287 2018-10-25 05:51:30 First we should keep low fuel  rates and expansion of taxes on those commodities which are not necessary like make up Corbin, imported textiles etc.
288 2018-10-25 05:48:16 A frightening thing is most of those manning the institutions have become purchasable commodIties. If they and the rulers desert morals as easily as they can desert their wives the edifice of the fragile democracy is bound to be in ruins. Blame the man who thinks he is a monarch.
289 2018-10-25 05:45:25 it's still going to be expensive for ordinary people to import basic commodities or else this is fundraising exercise

As is underground mining (yes, I know you are thinking coal @emo_trashhhhh) but there are so many other commodities that are required for a civilization. Even coal, gas and oil have uses other than just as fossil fuels... (cont)

293 2018-10-25 05:30:19 U can exchange btc for stocks and commodities? In USA?
294 2018-10-25 05:27:04 Agreed. We will see MANY second layer solutions. Bitcoin is bedrock.

And ETH is getting attack from the other side by all the smart contract platforms like EOS. I think smart contract platforms become commodities eventually using BTC as gas. Logical conclusion IMO.

298 2018-10-25 05:15:55 Agree with your general sentiment here. I'm long very few and in small positions and trading mainly commodities so looking at this from something of a distance. Looks like controlled selling to me; VIX seems to confirm that. Can accelerate quickly though....

301 2018-10-25 04:54:51 Are you sure Bon Marche and Pick n Pay were open after 6PM last night? I also shop at Avondale and these major retail outlets have notices of new trading hours. To me prices of all basic commodities are still exorbitantly high.
302 2018-10-25 04:51:42 From what I understand, all digital assets can and are sold OTC, as are all stocks, shares and commodities, please correct me if I’m wrong. If this is the case then they can be singled out for criticism for this.

304 2018-10-25 04:47:51 Even if we do it on our own it doesn't take away costing of the  project and we must guard against inflating of prices. ..the cholera commodities procurement was a good example of inflating prices
305 2018-10-25 04:47:04 Honestly the road needs to be dualised  becoz we are now flocking to SA to buy the commodities in short supply locally. And we know what the Harare Beitbridge road is famous for! People burning alive!!
306 2018-10-25 04:43:30 Manufacture, don't just trade. There is money in manufacturing even though it is capital intensive. To achieve a big breakthrough, I had to start manufacturing the same product I was trading on; which is commodities.

311 2018-10-25 03:39:09 Eu não entendo como alguém ainda vota no PT, o partido que causou a maior crise moral e economia da história, na qual estamos, surfou nas ondas das commodities para financiar ditaduras e proporcionar o maior esquema de corrupção da  história.
312 2018-10-25 03:38:17 Puedes condicionar las commodities, el acceso, la accesibilidad y la oportunidad de atención, pero no tu trato hacia las personas.
313 2018-10-25 03:18:16 If commodities prices roll over as well then things could really ugly.
314 2018-10-25 03:02:26 The corporate definition of love is obsessed with commodities, property, and hoarding of things and experiences.
315 2018-10-25 03:00:52 Are you planning to have other Fiat pairings in coming months?

Also in reference to your video is the bigger picture to have XRP to other commodities trading available?

317 2018-10-25 02:35:59 So our Statutory Instruments meant to reduce importation of commodities and encourage domestic production have failed due to the selfishness of some cartels in Zimbabwe. So we are back to importing and increasing our import bill. Cry my beloved country!!
318 2018-10-25 02:29:09 Not only church money, they hv a body which provides them money. They work like n industry. We r not into selling faith because believe that is a connection with God but these ppl sell faith like commodities. Sellers get commission too.
319 2018-10-25 02:27:09 How are prices of these commodities manipulated or controlled?  Who controls or manipulates the prices?
320 2018-10-25 02:19:43 I think most Americans don't have their values set right on what their focus should be. So money gets spent on commodities like T.V., netflix, music, alcohol, eating out, etc. Rather than looking at what the savings can provide (security for your family financially).
321 2018-10-25 02:16:53 I tend to think $crypto will correlate more closely with commodities than anything else.

329 2018-10-25 01:49:05 You are VERY disconnected how  this actually works.   We don’t get to “pass on” costs.   World market commodities are not going up because Trudeau put in a Carbon Tax.

338 2018-10-25 00:52:54 Yes, sort of. Since Mars-side production focuses initially on bulk commodities which are less labor intensive, Earth-side labor dependence drops as slowly as possible, relative to total mass shipped. Remember, Mars labor is the cost leader.
