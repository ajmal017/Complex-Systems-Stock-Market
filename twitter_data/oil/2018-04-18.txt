9 2018-04-18 23:58:26 It's ok to be against oil and on the internet. We need to move toward more sustainable forms of energy. Bringing dirty bitumen to market is not going to make the world a better or a cleaner place.

68 2018-04-18 23:53:47 I think most Canadians get it they're just busy working, unlike the eco terrorists spending their days on social media, many of them on the payroll of those who benefit from cheap Canadian oil.  Not that long ago that would have gotten them a long prison sentence for treason.
69 2018-04-18 23:53:44 Hot flashes? There's a 5 essential oil blend that cuts the flash off, dead, I don't have blend with me but if you wake in the night, dab a bit under your nose. One of ingredients is clary sage. And husband, pups, won't mind. DM me for more info.

85 2018-04-18 23:52:04 Two, Alberta is beholden to oil. It is almost disturbing the amount of sway oil has has on our province and our politics. Especially as someone who has grown up here.

We are screwing over our environment due to the economic implications. There is nothing controversial with that.

93 2018-04-18 23:51:02 I've got spots, wrinkles and blemishes all over. My lamp is without oil and I burried the coins which were given to me. 

The bridegroom can't find me in this state... what will I tell him?

97 2018-04-18 23:49:40 Oil, gold and rates rip. People sing we don’t need any water let it burn. It does and we drop 30-50% and focus news on the rebuild. Trump gets a second term and we rally. #cnbcheadsgotojail

104 2018-04-18 23:48:49 Surprised to see olive oil so high up in that graphic. I still have some research to do on it. A lot of conflicting arguments on whether olive oil is healthy or not.
105 2018-04-18 23:48:47 I'm genuinely curious. Do you say things to piss people off, or do you really believe what you say? Or 50/50?
106 2018-04-18 23:48:42 Tiny bit of coconut oil or olive oil will help

108 2018-04-18 23:48:38 Yesterday Trudeau apologized he couldn't phase out the oil sands faster to politicians in France. The federal liberals are really controlled by @gmbutts ex WWF president the guy responsible for the disaster happening to Ontario. He requires liberal staffers to call him Mr PM.
109 2018-04-18 23:48:28 In desperate need of a really good primer! I've been using milk for magnesia for years now and it's the only thing that works. Seems like nobody sells the Philips brand anymore and my face is producing so much damn oil!
110 2018-04-18 23:48:20 why buy expensive makeup remover when you could use coconut oil for $$ cheaper
111 2018-04-18 23:48:07 Trump was definitely sharing the gospel with StormyD. He was sharing just as hard and fast as he could. He was sharing that dag gone gospel so deeply that she went to her knees to recieve it better. And when he was done sharing the gospel he annointed her with "holy oil". Amen

I rather wish natural resources not pollutants but the price? To high

So sometimes we need to be lowly

137 2018-04-18 23:45:17 Where are the customers? Why are they silent in this discussion? They have the LOOP in the US. Which can deliver 4 times as much oil, of higher quality in one tanker rather than 4. Sorry brah, we missed the boat on this one.

140 2018-04-18 23:45:07 We need tariffs on imported oil. Period.
141 2018-04-18 23:45:05 Yes, but plenty of times, we do not have knowledge to judge some political decisions

Take this example: I do not like oil, personally

But Portugal decided to allow exploration of oil in the country

Well, I do not like oil but I know that we need it, specially in case of war

There is 1400 years of slave history with African people having to cheer for the side that will be the most beneficial for AFRICAN economies, owning our own oil (instead of Arabs), women's rights
146 2018-04-18 23:44:37 We have a different world view I guess. Not Nimby. Its respect for the earth and all other living creatures. Would you feed your mother Big Macs 24/7? I doubt it. Likewise with Mother earth. Less cancer causing oil & more green energy is healthy.
147 2018-04-18 23:44:24 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
148 2018-04-18 23:44:22 Great tip.  I do the honey, chocolate and olive oil pretty much every day.

151 2018-04-18 23:44:08 BC needs to step up to the plate and realize where the oil and gas for their vehicles comes from. Tankers from overseas are already in the ocean.  Why not have Canadian oil in tankers??  Sewage is okay but not a Canadian oil product???
152 2018-04-18 23:44:06 Energy East was doomed from the start...it was poorly planned. Quebec also said no. As for hydro--we have quite few. Hard to know which one you're talking about hah We still have lots of pipes going ahead (natural gas & Line 3)--not gonna run out of oil or gas soon!
153 2018-04-18 23:44:02 #ThingsISayToMyCar Are you burning oil as well ya greedy cow?
154 2018-04-18 23:44:01 That's why I switched to avocado and flaxseed oil
155 2018-04-18 23:43:58 Shiiidd I can reopen the shop and use those oil tanks, so much potential

163 2018-04-18 23:42:35 Oil soars 2.9% to 3-year high, settling at $68.47, as US crude stockpiles drop. I believe the supply is either being lied about or artificially manipulated.

166 2018-04-18 23:41:55 No but someone told me to try Argan oil for my hair. I used it once and liked it. Chile, I didn't even list all the oils/butters/moisturizers I have for my hair. LOL!
167 2018-04-18 23:41:54 Because the east believes only Alberta benefits from the sale and distribution of oil sands. And Justin has not DONE anything to change their minds.
168 2018-04-18 23:41:47 Are you unhappy with your body wash because it dries your skin out ? Put a few tablespoons of baby oil in it. Shake before each use!
169 2018-04-18 23:41:28 Oil. A resource that only in recent history has become important. And yet, those Middle Eastern counties are so backwards compared to the White West. Money doesn't buy superiority, and your insinuation that it does shows your ignorance.
170 2018-04-18 23:41:28 I remember it well too. We were under a Labour gov & held to ransom by trade unions, who brought this country to it's knees through strikes. The only reason we were allowed to join was because of N. Sea oil/gas, which the EU's asset stripped. Same 4 fishing & manufacturing
171 2018-04-18 23:41:21 The guy reminds me of the Snake Oil dealer. No education, no military service no concept of foreign policy or democracy and people listen to him. Sad!
172 2018-04-18 23:41:21 THE BEST PIZZA! Did you get the truffle oil? The Tartufo2? It's so good. Also the Amore with the Capicola is insane.

178 2018-04-18 23:40:17 They know Canada imports 600,000 bbls.  of WTI crude every day because the oil companies won't refine AB crap.

Time for Ms.Nutley to get real and tell Big Oil to build infrastructure.

182 2018-04-18 23:39:57 All the dispensaries in SFL be taxing bruh. Who the fuck paying $40 for a quarter gram of oil
183 2018-04-18 23:39:44 This is so false it hurts.  The wage gap is in every single profession, higher risk or not.  This has nothing to do with men working in oil fields.
184 2018-04-18 23:39:40 Coconut oil hair masks are currently my favorite thing
185 2018-04-18 23:39:21 This is so disrespectful like why the rice still need to be on the stove. What happened to the browning on the chicken plus she needed to throw off some of the oil before the veggies
186 2018-04-18 23:39:17 These days an unattractive woman can get men just by appreciating them.

211 2018-04-18 23:36:20 Canadians have been subsidizing the oil business for decades because Conservatives have always been so incompetent at being successful at anything. May be time to cut Alberta free & stop all the subsidizes and save Canada big bucks.

233 2018-04-18 23:33:16 Yeah I couldn't tell if it's going to be so dependent on oil.

277 2018-04-18 23:26:58 Both. But revenue from gas and gas-derivative products (LNG, petrochemicals) long outpaced that of crude oil.
278 2018-04-18 23:26:54 Just a step towards risk reduction. I still like WTI to top $70. It was a big jump on only a modestly bullish report and I'm a little nervous about the lackluster refinery inputs esp vs 2017. If oil pulls back to $65, I may re-accumulate or just let my remaining holdings run.

Not just for the sake of McDavid himself. Does Buff try to collect players just to have them, or to try to win? Weird vibe in the replies.
286 2018-04-18 23:25:54 Philosophically, I don't think PM Trudeau wants any pipelines built.    He keeps speaking of weaning off of oil/gas, announcing carbon taxes, etc., which will cripple parts of the Canadian economy, and most/some provinces.   #cdnpoli

293 2018-04-18 23:25:07 What notley thinks will hurt bc will hurt the taxpayers in Alberta plus a ton more of oil patch layoffs..... Did she consider the added cost for transporting goods from Vancouver ports to Alberta? The taxpayers in Alberta will have to ante up !!    Narrow thinking
294 2018-04-18 23:24:45 Majority capital fleeing is oil base, you have lot of tech companies setting up shop here. when you look at FDI flow and oil prices you get real picture of what's leaving. It's not first time in history. That's why CNQ takes advantage everytime and buy assets at bargain prices.

321 2018-04-18 23:21:30 The SNP had no reason to anticipate the North Sea oil boom which gave their cause wings. If they hadn't put in the hard work in the unpromising decades prior they could never have exploited it.
322 2018-04-18 23:21:28 @MBuhari and his speech writers should cover their faces in shame with that ill-advised and shallow claim that youths in #Nigeria are lazy and waiting for oil money.

338 2018-04-18 23:19:32 KM has all the shipping capacity tied up in 20-year contracts with Alberta oil producers that require the producers to pay whether or not they actually ship that volume. This is a rock solid, profitable business model. We should all run our businesses like this.

350 2018-04-18 23:18:29 That the dollar's appreciation due to the oil boom would harm some provinces' exports, and slow their recoveries.

431 2018-04-18 23:07:14 So five more coils but my truck is running smooth and the check engine light is off, hopefully forever. 

Just need to do an oil change  to make sure metal shavings aren't in it. 

If there are, better to get a new motor. 5k? where would I get that kind of money? e_e_p
432 2018-04-18 23:06:59 oil may be a base for many things we use but that doesn’t mean we have to get it from tarsands
433 2018-04-18 23:06:53 Apply almond oil around the mouth to keep your lips supple and soften the lines.
434 2018-04-18 23:06:47 Oh god the oil just got my arm
435 2018-04-18 23:06:30 And IMHO @drvox was (rightly) generous towards pro-market side in weighing costs of BDP.  Health care & other costs of long term impact of China’s air pollution may also not be cheap; neither are US costs for future military actions to protect oil supply or due to climate change.
436 2018-04-18 23:06:09 I dabbed a little tea tree oil on a paper towel and dabbed in on my black heads and they’re literally disappearing over night.
437 2018-04-18 23:05:07 MSNBC got shows in which truth is told? Honestly didn't know. Guy is on point but he's still being diplomatic and quite pragmatic if you like. The truth is the war is about OIL and MONEY (central bank). Do your research from there. Politicians & anchors lying to the public daily
438 2018-04-18 23:05:01 ありがとうございます！お仕事出来るくらいには回復しました！w
439 2018-04-18 23:04:59 Since oil is the base of almost everything in the world that's made Id say oil is more multifaceted than anything else. McDonald's is way more dangerous than any pipeline. And mining and forestry are not sustainable. And the tourism industry affects more wildlife than most things
440 2018-04-18 23:04:48 OIL DIFF: 5.18 -> 5.2
441 2018-04-18 23:04:44 Hi sweeties! Jackie did another video on our foundation and used the oil and loved it 
442 2018-04-18 23:04:43 Yes because Saudi’s Arabia has BOUGHT HIM OFF! He wants their oil imported. He HATES Alberta and Albertans because daddy had our greatest Premier stop him cold. 2019 can’t come fast enough.
443 2018-04-18 23:04:38  dangg I’m sorry go get some black castor oil and put it on your lash line every night!
444 2018-04-18 23:04:36 This is a excellent video, especially if you enjoy watching oil herself up
445 2018-04-18 23:04:25 I need a oil change in my car ... & Adrian playing games
446 2018-04-18 23:04:00 Does that mean PMJT owes you 280K for establishing why CDN oil is languishing behind other countries
447 2018-04-18 23:03:44 Mommy was quick and had oil down last week Saturday. Lmao
448 2018-04-18 23:03:13 It isn't just geo-politics, it is also a combination of fundamentals (no build in Q1, Permian bottlenecks, OPEC+ production "cuts", strong demand) and OPEC $100 oil chatter. Not saying price will stick, I don't buy/sell all oil, but the fundamentals are in place to support this $
449 2018-04-18 23:03:12 Imagine the value of the pound without oil to back it up
450 2018-04-18 23:03:09 Alfredo, pesto,  rose sauce, vodka sauce, olive oil and garlic, butter, stroganoff, lemon, white wine sauce, balsamic vinaigrette, ALL CHEESES IMAGINABLE.

455 2018-04-18 23:02:33 Crude oil is up 35% this year, 10% this month and 2,5% this week. In fact oil $ has steadily increased on average when you look @ 30 years.

471 2018-04-18 23:00:25 When is the last time you got an oil change? It's important for your car because it lubricates many parts of the engine and acts as a cooling agent to prevent the engine from overheating.
472 2018-04-18 23:00:18 Here’s the tip of the day:  a guy who lived to be 110 years old listed the five foods he believes got him there.  Garlic, chocolate, honey, olive oil, and cinnamon.  There you go.

481 2018-04-18 22:59:47 I really have no idea how I would use Chilli Oil as i had not heard of it - but it looks like it would be delicious poured over those peppers, mushrooms and roasted ... yum ! Better to eat vegetables - be healthy !
482 2018-04-18 22:59:42 higher oil helps too, may be more important to forecast than measures (just a guess)
483 2018-04-18 22:59:41 goodnight im tired of castor oil getting into my eyes ( beauty is pain )
484 2018-04-18 22:59:36 Great for Nigeria. Delusional dependence on oil will reduce.
485 2018-04-18 22:59:32 Well considering you've never even been out there you are hugely misinformed.  We are a carbon negative county. Go to the reclaimed areas and see all the wildlife in there. And tailings ponds are cleaned up and paid for by the oil companies. It's part of the regulations
486 2018-04-18 22:59:18 It’s the same problem with socdems jerking off over Norway’s welfare state funded by their oil production instead of looking at Cuba, where all those social programs and more are there and they didn’t fund it with fucking oil money

488 2018-04-18 22:59:15 I cannot comment on your case; but in general; MultiVitamins, Fish Oil, Co-Enzyme Q and all these supplements have not been shown to have any primary preventative benefit. I've been trying to talk folks in #Gambia from making me pay excess for useless medicines.
489 2018-04-18 22:59:08 How stupid: ""Debt Service Obligations must B excluded 2 reach 20 cts"  Every municipal utility in the US could identically say-"we must suspend debt service so we can achieve a lowr rate we want 4 our customers"; Is 20 cts magic? How abt PR 29 cts in 2014, when oil was ovr $100?
490 2018-04-18 22:59:08 When boiling water and it starts foaming over, pour in some olive oil. Just a bit. It'll make the overflowing go away.
491 2018-04-18 22:58:51 Guys, did you hear what our President said about Nigerian Youths being lazy and dependent on government and oil money?
So me that spent 5 years under an umbrella at Ibom Plaza to repair mobile Phones was I depending on him?
492 2018-04-18 22:58:45 .... (2/2) increase infrastructure spending so cities can update/develop better public transit to reduce car dependency. Our oil needs will never go away without better transit

497 2018-04-18 22:58:12 Stop beating the dead horse. Coal is finished. Try to attract manufacturers of parts for clean energy like wind & sun power. That is the future. I know. I'm from Louisiana, & our economy is still reeling from the drop in oil & gas prices b/c of lack of diversity in our economy.

499 2018-04-18 22:57:58 No maah shower and oil up fuss.
500 2018-04-18 22:57:51 Would be more helpful to see stock market peak. Also, rising oil prices may be related to inverted yield curve.
501 2018-04-18 22:57:49 Ain’t nothing slick to a can of oil baby 
502 2018-04-18 22:57:42 Because they’re not, like any commodity prices rise and fall through cycles. This is a long term investment and despite what anyone thinks, demand for oil isn’t tapering off anytime soon.

541 2018-04-18 22:53:01 can. i feel you babe. oily skin is compensating the lack of oil on skin surface thus the overproduction of oil. the skin gets dehydrated due to lack of water in the deeper layers of the skin so you need to drink more water, have more citrus fruits and apply salicylic acids.
542 2018-04-18 22:53:00 I will never wait that long again because it makes no fcking sense that i had to paid $82 for an oil change when cameron can change that shit FOR FREE !!!!

563 2018-04-18 22:50:04 3) No need to flavor the oil. That's what salsas are for. And skip the onions.  It's a useless addition.
564 2018-04-18 22:50:03 Truth. I had some olive oil as well. Hubby joked that he’d heard about tossing salad but vinaigrette?
565 2018-04-18 22:49:46 true!!! bc there's nothing political about imagining a world without a reliance on oil, bc oil has nothing to do with politics

572 2018-04-18 22:49:08 You may be right.  From what I recall the Liberals have many friends in high places invested into Canadian rail, however.  They have one thing going for them either way here, though.  It will pit farmers and the oil patch against each other.

579 2018-04-18 22:48:10 I just wonder who's leading who. If the market correct significantly and bond yields rally, oil drops. Or oil rallies and bonds sell off. Hard to tell which one is driving. Good correlation thou

Price has solved the question, extension in wave v of C of 4 it is. A spike reversal into the 70's is one way this wave 4 can end, moving a little deeper into the time window as per the Jan 10 tweet. Iran's not completed yet, which is the geopol point of interest.

My palms may be lil hard but the rest of my body Smooth like Butter 
596 2018-04-18 22:46:06 No so. Our gvmnt wanted to sell oil and in the same time to get budget from Baghdad, i.e. to sell its oil and take a share from Iraq oil, something Iraq didn't accept (unless fool enough). Our govmnt PM was so arrogant to say: Baghdad has no money and we won't negotiate with it

I live in Alaska and I personally think Trump is trying to cut the Mideast out of the oil loop. With our own oil their prices will have to come down.

628 2018-04-18 22:42:34 Cannot stress enough how very OVERJOYED the affluent are with their tax haul, as well as the oil & gas guys. They must know something. This elation is back to pre-election naseum.
629 2018-04-18 22:42:26 @realDonaldTrump with the tax cuts in place the benefits are dwindling due to the increase fuel and oil prices. Time to call the Saudi’s.

698 2018-04-18 22:34:31 I would agree but i want our society to move away from oil not invest more into it, time for our country to set a global example
699 2018-04-18 22:34:25 If I masturbate with baby oil is it pedophilia? 
700 2018-04-18 22:34:05 Yeah, we like making bacon on rifles, pollutin’ our rivers and land to benefit the oil and gas workers - I ain’t fishing much lately anyway.  And besides that there is the bonus of keepen women and people of color in their place.  Seriously?  WTF
701 2018-04-18 22:34:04 I just spilled a full diffuser with “tantric” scented oil in it and now my whole house smells like a Vegas hotel lobby.
702 2018-04-18 22:33:59 I use Argan oil on my hair. Works really well. It does have to be 100% organic Argan, and in a black bottle away from any sunlight
703 2018-04-18 22:33:49 Hey Lumpy: WaPo journalists are actual, legitimate, professional JOURNALISTS who check and verify their sources. You are a college dropout snake oil salesman who peddles insane conspiracy theories verified by nobody but the voices in your head. I know who I trust and it ain’t you

709 2018-04-18 22:33:38 I had oil shooting out my dipstick and it was falling on my exhaust and smoking and I thought my engine was done. Turned out to be my pcv valve and grommet. 15 dollar fix and I thought it was time for a small block

728 2018-04-18 22:31:10 Your game is silly USA spent $4 trillion 10s of thousands USA soldiers killed & injured,Iraq destroyed, millions of Iraqis their lives destroyed but USA can't find $100 billion to rebuild Iraq. Ask your slaves in Saudi Arabia and Gulf Sheikhs of oil to pay as USA fought for them.
729 2018-04-18 22:30:39 Oil or natural resources are in Most cases a burden and curse to developing nations, if there is real will we can develop and achieve economic growth by fighting corruption and working for National interest rather than tribal

733 2018-04-18 22:30:28 With 2/3 of the world’s energy being coal, gas or oil it will be a long LONG transition - likely 60-120 years. The ENTIRE food chain today for 8B+ people runs on oil. Where are all the #etractors #eShips #eCombines or #eTrucks?
734 2018-04-18 22:30:24 No question Obama loves the planet but on his watch, 2009-2013, more than 8,000 miles of oil transmission pipelines were built in the USA. Innovation, not prohibition, is where Canada can and should lead.
735 2018-04-18 22:30:22 Nick, how does "ending oil exploration" mean people will "stop using fossil fuels"? A ban is on the supply-side, but the issue is demand-side driven. So Carbon prices like the ETS shift demand, whereas a ban just means supply will be met from Saudi etc, so no emission reductions.
736 2018-04-18 22:30:08 B.C to block Alberta and Saskatchewan to join Alberta to restrict oil why? Stop it in JESUS Name where do people go to get oil if not from inside within CANADA. Work together all as usual rebuke the demon of divisions. I'm glad most of you are here in my page you will get z msg
737 2018-04-18 22:30:06 BC lefties demand that Alberta and Saskatchewan end the oilsands and stop shipping oil over the mountains, thereby putting that oil at risk of being spilled.

Alberta and Saskatchewan agree to do so. Then BC flips out and calls it a threat.

You guys are joking, right?
738 2018-04-18 22:30:03 Just purchased a specially prepared cannabis oil for my dog to ease his pain from congestive heart failure. I love that Seattle even has pot stores for dogs.
739 2018-04-18 22:30:00 Not dead, just catching up on life, especially not full of oil.
740 2018-04-18 22:29:56 I'm in support of the pipeline, but at the same time I realize this is not our only revenue stream in Canada. Scheer would have us believe we will live or die on oil revenues.
741 2018-04-18 22:29:49 Oil change, new car insurance, registration renewal.. I’m broke.
742 2018-04-18 22:29:44 yes, i saw a girl do highlighter & baby oil &....that’s just to easy

745 2018-04-18 22:29:40 Baby oil, warm/hot water and a microfibre cloth! Ideally a soak in the bath first, use baby oil on the area, and a good scrub with a microfibre cloth/flannel/towel. Also again scrub with a dry towel once you get out.
746 2018-04-18 22:29:21 Throw in naked & oil and I’m all in

748 2018-04-18 22:28:46 “More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education for free.” - President @MBuhari
749 2018-04-18 22:28:45 Argan oil, also take vitamin E tablets
750 2018-04-18 22:28:43 You're going to call me a dummy while failing to read what I said? 

"Most auto oils are now synthetic and" (here's the part you need to pay attention to) "very little (if none at all) actual oil" ... There's different grades to synthetic oil utilizing various refined levels.
751 2018-04-18 22:28:35 @animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
752 2018-04-18 22:28:28 Seems odd that the federal government will be subsidizing an oil pipeline. If it's to risky to be commercially viable, why should taxpayers pick up the risk when we should be funding renewable energy #cdnpoli #pnpcbc
753 2018-04-18 22:28:25 Had to turn off the news @NewsHour ..they were giving the whole first 1/2hour to the Bush family. Oil rich planet ruiners who lived in an elite bubble and wanted to keep it that way. War starters. War perpetuators. Ugh. #badmood
754 2018-04-18 22:28:25 Agreed and though there are those who continue to believe Kevin Lowe is running the show behind the scenes, I do not. That said, the arrogance piece of the equation from the organization is undeniable.
755 2018-04-18 22:28:05 That oil price! 
 I prefer the fact that they have over 1500 retail outlets across Canada!

757 2018-04-18 22:27:36 I’ve been trying to call my service advisor @JeepCares in pompano Beach since 9 Am and when I finally got in contact with someone all my questions couldn’t get answer. I just need an oil change and for y’all to fix the recall on my darnm break

766 2018-04-18 22:26:49 They sold their souls to the devil in this case big oil for their #DirtyMoney. It's obvious they care more about money than protecting the environment.

776 2018-04-18 22:25:55 No but I have no trouble whatsoever believing the Bush’s, (Saudi oil business partners), were in it for the black gold. Trump’s ideas for grabbing all the oil was his own authentic policy idea.
777 2018-04-18 22:25:54 Shovel in more coal! 
778 2018-04-18 22:25:53 Wait but...are you cooking the onions while the oil burns?

814 2018-04-18 22:20:50 Nice.   And statements like that are why @KenovaSir is no longer allowed on our social media.  ^.^;;    He did ask if you had finished it with your usual oil, though.
815 2018-04-18 22:20:44 Meanwhile, since Nig discovered oil in the 70s, he himself has not rested. But by God that oil will one day be controlled by the God given owners of the oil. And it’s going to be very soon. THE WHOLE NORTH HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT OIL. It’s not theirs!!!!
816 2018-04-18 22:20:20 Compare my $PQ oil play I found for us today to some of the “oilers” that were being alerted today and tell me which held gains
817 2018-04-18 22:20:13 I don't get it. Everyone on the left coast is demanding we stop pumping oil and stop building pipelines. Saskatchewan and Alberta aren't threatening you; they're merely offering to do as you say.

That feeling you have, when you realize you need oil? It's cognitive dissonance.
818 2018-04-18 22:20:00 Nestle IS contrary to bf. It isn’t anything else but that. That’s why they are boycotted. And that’s before we even get onto their use of palm oil..cocoa workers of dubious age... and taking water from drought areas.
819 2018-04-18 22:19:59 You Nigerian youths are greedy. You sit and do nothing, only wait for Nigeria Delta oil money. 

Greedy lots!
820 2018-04-18 22:19:52 Sucking up to war mongers and  Canadian prime ministers who treat their indigenous people badly just to keep the oil flowing - yeah, that's going to win our votes ... NOT

833 2018-04-18 22:18:28 True,yet production can quickly recover, but reserves not. This is also the big challenge for shale  as middle distillates and octane rich liquids are just not there, leading  at some point to soaring US imports of WTI crude oil.
834 2018-04-18 22:18:28 Hopefully she won't pick up the habit of disrespecting and treating our indigenous people poorly,  the way you did, just to keep the rich Oil Barons happy.
835 2018-04-18 22:18:22 As a wrote, the input, regardless how small, is unnecessary. Bad on OEG and him for thinking it is good. It illustrates to me a sense of arrogance. They know better than others. No other GM does it.
836 2018-04-18 22:18:14 they do anything to make a profit. profit drives everything oil companies do. tarsands aren't as profitable as conventional oil sources but if there's any chance to make a buck on them, the resource sector will try - so long as there's no liability in the long run #sunsetindustry

838 2018-04-18 22:18:10 Note the misrepresentation of activists as being focused on extraction rather than use, and the presumption that there's no important distinction between CA heavy oil and lighter crudes. And hey, what about those tar sands imports?

842 2018-04-18 22:17:56 Oil is a dying industry. A majority of the worlds major companies are looking at green initiatives and most vehicle manufacturers are going electric. There’s no point destroying the environment for something that’s becoming increasingly obsolete. This isn’t the 60s anymore

844 2018-04-18 22:17:40 That's absolutely fascinating, thank you! Used to live on Broadgate Lane, so he marched right past my front door - and The Bridge by Oil Mill Beck was my local!
845 2018-04-18 22:17:19 Today's teens have their Spotify but in MY day we had to make do with finding an oil tanker in a hurricane
846 2018-04-18 22:17:16 Very hopeful. I like the idea of a congressman listening to constituents rather than the NRA, Big Oil & Gas Cos, Pharmacutical Cos, and the Koch Brothers.  Science is real, gun violence is real, Healthcare is important, and human rights are too...  more important than the PACS.

849 2018-04-18 22:17:04 This is so unconstitutional it can be shot down by the "Night Court" characters; so what do these colonials think they're going to gain? The remotest chance that 1st Amendment rights don't apply to Big Oil?

851 2018-04-18 22:16:56 Now we're powering cars with #Oil and make plastic out of it. Even if we really could have electric cars only and no plastic on earth in the near future. Who says that the scientists will not find a new application for #Oil to create other useful things out of it?

854 2018-04-18 22:16:11 I think you meant Shadow President not Chief oil Staff.
855 2018-04-18 22:15:58 Why not? Are the old people not lazily taking from the same oil?! Is the president himself not in love with Nigs oil at his GREAT AGE?!
Please practice what you preach! @MrAyeDee
856 2018-04-18 22:15:44 Because in this country we are all too friggin spineless to do anything about this big oil companies an F in taxes
857 2018-04-18 22:15:38 5-10 years ago, it was all about #oil and gas in the Arctic. Today, it’s about #digital connectivity, autonomous shipping, and new subsea fibre optic cables. Region is in early stages of transformation from 2nd to 3rd industrial revolution. #IMFMeetings #IMF @IMFNews #energy
858 2018-04-18 22:15:21 Settled not lost. As Trump said, the settlement cost him a fraction of what the judgement would have been. Translation? Mr "I never settle" knew he would have lost. Once a snake oil salesman always a snake oil salesman.
859 2018-04-18 22:15:18 The flour, sugar and oil in that sandwich are all highly processed foods that are a recent invention. We did not evolve to eat sandwiches. They are not inherently healthy. This meal is diabetes in a box , for some sooner than others.
860 2018-04-18 22:15:18 A fair point Gregor but with due respect to both yourself & Chiarelli, if that is what he agreed to when took on the position, shame on Peter. It's an idiotic ask to be sure, and my guess is the Oil Kings portion is minimal, but still, an unnecessary one to place on a GM.

871 2018-04-18 22:14:17 One time I was walking from Princeton to Farmersville at midnight and this cop picked me up and he asked if I had any weapons in my backpack but I didn't. So he gave me a ride but what he didn't know was I had weed, a pipe, and THC oil in there 
872 2018-04-18 22:14:16 Room is so hot coconut oil is right in the fridge already melted 
873 2018-04-18 22:14:14 The Mustang GT I bought my wife is such an incredible car that I figure the only time Kathy will let me drive it will be going to church on Sunday morning and perhaps on our Friday night dates to Hot Springs. Oh and when she wants me to gas it up or change the oil.

880 2018-04-18 22:13:22 Or she did  ;-)
881 2018-04-18 22:13:21 That still doesn't mean it's cheap. No company works for free. And if other sources where better off trust me the oil companies would do it. Easier than dealing with uninformed protesters and smaller profits
882 2018-04-18 22:13:19 Unbelievable is the key word... Unless you're the buye/fpllower of snake oil.

887 2018-04-18 22:12:18 Yesterday went to @jiffylube for quick oil change. Well yo yo at shop made me wait 20 mins to upsell me an air filter or sumpin' and couldn't just let me drop off car. #notjiffy

898 2018-04-18 22:10:56 How to look attractive according to @glossier 
- slather yourself in Vaseline
- add oil to your hair on top of having not washed it for 2 weeks
- be sticky. Like physically when someone touches you , be sticky.

912 2018-04-18 22:09:48 We could start off by building on these ideas right here in Canada! Transition away fromboom and bust fossil fuel industry toward cleaner alternatives.

913 2018-04-18 22:09:42 You get the basic oil then ....
914 2018-04-18 22:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.

922 2018-04-18 22:08:31 Tip - if you don’t want to spend the $$ on Fenty’s Body Lava, you can make your own. Order mica powder ($10 on Amazon) and add it to your oil based moisturizer and boom you have your own body lava!
923 2018-04-18 22:08:06 Not down playing at all, but have seen no evidence that it is currently underway on scale large enough to impact climate as Naomi claims. Planet quite obviously still warming, oil companies quite obviously still allowed to burn fossil fuels to heart's content.

966 2018-04-18 22:02:39 Hi Alex, I regret that we can't move away from oil faster either. That does not mean that I am not aware of it's critical need and essential economic nature. It's just that someday it would be better if we had a better, less cumbersome energy source.

971 2018-04-18 22:02:16 What Buhari was trying to say is that his Daura boys sit and do nothing while waiting for the sales of oil from the Niger Delta.
972 2018-04-18 22:02:16 Nearly 74 dollars a barrel now. Oil is on the up but Scotland will never really see any benefit as part of the UK.

974 2018-04-18 22:01:49 I always cut them up into fries, and put olive oil and veggie seasoning then bake them in the oven! It’s pretty good
975 2018-04-18 22:01:47 Also unforgivable: broken promise to end subsidies to oil companies while claiming to support transition to renewables
976 2018-04-18 22:01:44 Maybe he fetishes giving him an oil rubdown.
977 2018-04-18 22:01:43 Ben and Adam came to pick up my car at work to take it to get the oil changed and put air in my tires. 
978 2018-04-18 22:01:40 Ya car sound like a beast fresh off a oil change 
979 2018-04-18 22:01:33 So you will overstep your constitutional powers and illegally force businesses to refuse to sell gas and oil to BC? How stupid are you and your Trumpian followers. You sir are right now the greatest threat to confederation since the FLQ. Please act like a leader for once!

993 2018-04-18 22:00:36 On the basis that Britain virtually appointed Saudi monarchy don't you think Saudi was a vassal state for uk/US interests in middle east? Alliance of Iran, Russia, China threatens US global hegemony more than it's a threat to Saudi. US now occupies 30% Syria with it's oil/gas
994 2018-04-18 22:00:35 The 3m people who lost their jobs in the past year or so did so because they wanna sit at home and wait for oil windfall? Kai! Who ate your brain.? How can you support that statement? Kai
995 2018-04-18 22:00:34 The  cost of producing oil extracted from shale is high due to technical  complexity and degree of purity and has no price flexibility and  therefore does not compete with the oil market at the present time. All these reports are just opinions .. Greetings

1005 2018-04-18 21:58:56 No.  It is TOTALLY & I MEAN TOTALLY unacceptable to put ANY & I MEAN ANY non-organic palm oil into ANY & I MEAN ANY food or non-food product.  There is NO safe limit for the Earth.  If this isn't heavily retweeted to viral, I might just stop protesting permanently for God's sake.
1006 2018-04-18 21:58:49 CBD oil is a godsend. If you suffer from anxiety & haven't tried it, I highly recommend it.

1011 2018-04-18 21:57:44 @IcelandNatural how sad to learn U will be killing 191 of the endangered Fin Whales! Just do not understand the logic. U ban palm oil with your major grocery chain to save the environment but then U kill endangered whales...

1013 2018-04-18 21:57:19 The closer to summer we get the higher prices will get. People travel more for vacation and need gas so oil companies can raise the price which makes the gas station raise price. Supply and demand.
1014 2018-04-18 21:57:19 #Canada @JustinTrudeau @liberal_party @CBCNews @ElizabethMay ... Any thoughts?  Any???  So we are to leave our oil in the ground and instead, ship it in from other (dictator-led) countries?

1017 2018-04-18 21:57:17 No, but hydro sure can run charging stations for electric motors .. Most auto oils are now synthetic and very little (if none at all) actual oil ... There's still work to do, but the options are there ...

1023 2018-04-18 21:56:25 There are natural leave ins. I like art naturals leave in conditioner with argon oil and it’s a 10. The only chemical in that one is panthenol which isn’t bad for your hair. I have curly fine hair and I know what frizz is like. Gotta keep your hair hydrated.

Everything was excellent, but the chicken says to "slice a head of garlic lengthwise" and then cook in oil in pot with farro - is that right?
1030 2018-04-18 21:55:43 Who preventing oil drilling ?
1031 2018-04-18 21:55:43 These guys have the mentality of children "character, values" yeah why should political parties be about policies.
1032 2018-04-18 21:55:35 Except that in Occupied/Okkupert, it’s Norway who stopped oil and gas exports to the EU, who—desperate for oil and gas—collude with Russia to invade Norway, to get the oil & gas turned back on.

You watched the show, right?
1033 2018-04-18 21:55:26 Do you honestly believe that an oil company would spend extra money and time and refining on a production they could do it easier and cheaper? Have you ever worked up in Fort Mac?

1043 2018-04-18 21:54:01 Well then you know your previous statement was nothing more than words pulled out of your ass echoed by the oil industry .. Gaslighting a discussion (no pun intended) .. 'Phasing out' and 'shutting down' (Scheer's words) are two entirely different discussions.
1044 2018-04-18 21:53:54 Genius ,they are an oil company who is obstructing oil drilling . Duh

1047 2018-04-18 21:53:31 Good luck getting a middle eastern country to listen to Trudeau. Or talk to Horgan about bc being one of the largest coal exporters in the world. Plus countries are going back to coal because they can't get enough oil volumes in their countries.
1048 2018-04-18 21:53:21 So, to confirm, your ok with getting oil products from other countries with human rights issues and poor environmental controls for BC?   Sort of a "screw everyone else (including your own country) as long as it's not in my backyard" type of philosophy.

1054 2018-04-18 21:52:26 no they dont like any use of it any transport over big distances uses oil or a derivative of it  so they use it just like the rest of us even more so how many of us have heavy oil powered boats ect .

1060 2018-04-18 21:51:31 I’m not ignoring the effects at all.  Yes, policies of the past have hurt younger generations.  I don’t think it was intentional on the part of the public. The oil industry & politicans are largely responsible for that.

1108 2018-04-18 21:45:59 Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd. said April 18 that its Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project was facing "unquantifiable risk" due to the British Columbia government's continued opposition and reported a 5.1% drop in first-quarter earnings.

The rumored Russia & NATO bombing shd not be part of agenda in the name of recruiting our youths. Ug. now has oil among other natural resources that u can explore Mr  President to employ & empower the youths- Ug vision 2040.

1112 2018-04-18 21:45:18 @seanhannity The Saudis know the US has great oil reserves which is why they are trying to buy all our refineries after they take ARAMCO public #chokepoints
1113 2018-04-18 21:45:13 that one will now come back and be begging jobless youths that don't go to school and expect free oil money to vote for him

1115 2018-04-18 21:44:53 #cdnpoli BC Should cancel all the Cruise/Cargo Ships that come to port. They each carry 100s of 1000s of liters of Oil and can spill also!

1120 2018-04-18 21:44:00 Kinder Morgan's CEO starts to talk about the Alberta gov't threat towards B.C. to curtail oil shipments, but then stops and says he won't bother getting into the back and fourth between the two provinces.
1121 2018-04-18 21:43:47 That is not entirely true. The govt is independent and sell oil to most other nations
1122 2018-04-18 21:43:42 it bc of inflation and oil is $70/barrel.....

1127 2018-04-18 21:43:29 Quick econ lesson for @JustinTrudeau: logic of carbon tax is to make renewables cheaper to use than oil. When you SUBSIDIZE oil & APPROVE and then BAIL OUT failing pipelines that makes oil cheaper and ups demand. Your policies work against each other

1128 2018-04-18 21:43:28 President Museveni needs to start selling some oil quickly so that he can support neopatrimonialism.  State House wants Shs134.5bn to clear presidential pledges and donations made over time.

1132 2018-04-18 21:42:46 YES!!!!  VOTE 11/6/18  AND END CITIZENS UNITED in order to stop people like the Koch brothers [oil] from dumping BILLIONS into campaigns!!!!!!!!

1140 2018-04-18 21:41:57 You guys fought viciously for Buhari because you were so obsessed with Niger Delta oil that you felt all Nigeria needed was "An Honest Person Who Will Share The Oil Money Properly '. 

You mistook his poverty of mind and spirit for honesty and sincerity.

1143 2018-04-18 21:41:51 I've started using grape seed oil for all my cooking and I'm in love  it cooks sooo Well! No nasty taste.

1145 2018-04-18 21:41:42 I only wash my hair about once a week, but I use a pastel purple shampoo/conditioner from Brite which recolours it, and follow up with a coconut oil mask. Then I throw in a leave-in hair oil from OGX before I blow dry. I also dry shampoo once a week :3

1154 2018-04-18 21:41:13 Why would the PM apologize for still being in the oil business? Does he think before he speaks, if you were an international investor would that give you the confidence to invest in Canada?
1155 2018-04-18 21:41:12 I'm very "old-school" ... my profile pic is an oil painting .... literally! :)

1158 2018-04-18 21:40:51 One would think this would be the EPA's responsibility, but no. EPA has to find where to dig for oil, mine for copper

1162 2018-04-18 21:40:26 Ive been natural a  year and a half. Full disclosure, this is my second time going natural. The first time I didnt understand the needs of my hair. This time around I educated myself on the products that work for me-products such as aloe vera, shea butter coconut oil etc.
1163 2018-04-18 21:40:16 First night putting coconut oil on my eyelashes. “Before” pictures taken. Exciting times.

1165 2018-04-18 21:40:13 A Massachusetts judge has ruled that ExxonMobil cannot stop a probe into whether the oil giant misled shareholders for decades about the dangers of climate change and its impact on their business.
1166 2018-04-18 21:40:09 My skin is starting to act up, and since I have to stay up for so long, I have the time to go drown my skin in facemask, tea tree oil, toner and whatever I have so it stops
1167 2018-04-18 21:40:07 Now compare that to rail. Because we will move the oil to the coast one way or another and that's not even a question
1168 2018-04-18 21:39:50 olive oil
1169 2018-04-18 21:39:48 I would settle for today's player wearing a proper uni...like Griffey in the GIF. Instead we got pants hanging to the ground looking like a cross between pajamas and oil change attendants...beards like a House of David 9... fat and slouchy
1170 2018-04-18 21:39:42 What is it with these oil and money comments..The fact is these  clubs have money, will compete for trophies and do

1172 2018-04-18 21:39:17 Did you talk about how the price of gas is going up here and oil is up to $68 a barrel I'm sure Putin
1173 2018-04-18 21:39:15 yep.....but the major reason to oppose KM is not threat of a catastrophic oil spill but the impact on climate change and increasing fossil fuel production, which few seem to care about....
1174 2018-04-18 21:38:59 Oil
1175 2018-04-18 21:38:56 Here's an idea to build on: LEAVE THE OIL IN THE GROUND
1176 2018-04-18 21:38:54 oil can be drilled for practically anywhere, imminent domain runs amok, manufacturing is now allowed to pollute our air in the worst ways possible in years (possibly decades), the USA has pulled out of a major international environmental protection treaty. (2)
1177 2018-04-18 21:38:52 Absorbs all the oil that’s trying to poke through.
1178 2018-04-18 21:38:52 Shut the hell up. This doesn't make oil companies any less guilty of purposely misleading the public.
1179 2018-04-18 21:38:50 @bp_owl fish and olive oil are only healthy in COMPARISON to meat and butter.  If you really want to maximize health (including normal BP), ditch both olive oil and fish.  Olive oil has been shown to decrease endothelial function.
1180 2018-04-18 21:38:35 I agree, Canada comes first, which is why our governments should never bend over backwards to appease a mulinational oil company. 

Our sovereignty is not for sale.
1181 2018-04-18 21:38:32 How long does it take a wind turbine to generate enough "clean" energy to break even on all the coal/oil it takes to make and set up a wind turbine?
1182 2018-04-18 21:38:29 Ladies, please patronize us coconut oil for sale!!!
1183 2018-04-18 21:38:23 New MSM logic: Trump only hit syria to drive up oil prices to help Vladimir Putin.
1184 2018-04-18 21:38:23 Well long story short electric company bought cheap illegal dirty oil and claimed the extra money was for upgrading, securenand fix the electricity.  Instead they pocketed it and then the hurricane hit the grid.

They don't call it corruption for nothing. Sadly no one charged.

We just read about it

We haven't really benefitted from oil

It is the likes of Buhari and his pot bellied senators and our parents that fed fat from our oil

1196 2018-04-18 21:36:45 I didn't want to go to Desert Storm, because I thought all Bush Jr. was doing was protecting our oil supply.  I stayed after Saddam was beaten, and my unit found lots of WMDs that were very deadly and could hurt troops. So, I guess it was a good thing we deposed a despot.
1197 2018-04-18 21:36:25 Yeah, don't interrupt virtue signaling from the morally superior millennial SJWs.

1199 2018-04-18 21:36:15 Oil production is the highest it has ever been in our country's history. Two pipelines are under construction and two others have been approved.

When is it ever enough for you folks?

1204 2018-04-18 21:35:41 @JRubinBlogger All Mitch & hypocrite GOP care about is their tax cuts, & dereg of oil, coal, air, water, credit industry pals.
1205 2018-04-18 21:35:40 So washing it, burning off the manufacturing layer of oil that’s often on the wok, then heating it and coating it with a layer of oil which builds and builds as you use it so the pan (in theory) lasts forever

1208 2018-04-18 21:34:59 What do you think of the idea that higher seed oil consumption lays the groundwork for damage. That is, elevated insulin in the presence of chronic damage via oxidation from Omega-6 PUFA. Or something.
1209 2018-04-18 21:34:57 Every barrel of oil costs the Tax payer 10 times more then it’s worth to extract, can’t you read a graph you ignorant tool, and stop asking so many questions. Every extra dollar in welfare payments equals 2 dollars in economic growth, it’s all there in the chart you dunce.

1211 2018-04-18 21:34:24 We do anyways, unless we build refineries we will always import oil.  The Pipeline just brings it to outside markets.

1243 2018-04-18 21:31:01 He's been in congress for years and he's a mormom from Utah. That's no problem, except he's the one who instigated the impeachment of Clinton. And, he's the one who helped tRump sign the drilling of oil to be reinstated in Bears Ears and the monumental staircase in Utah.
1244 2018-04-18 21:30:55 cASTOR OIL KEEPS COMING INTO MY EYES
1245 2018-04-18 21:30:51 The BBC are apologists of the dying Imperialist nations, allowing the US to beat Syria in to submission whilst stealing the oil from northern #Syria and Israel to steal oil in occupied Golan Heights.

1247 2018-04-18 21:30:39 I'm doing fine , thank you . Crude Oil made a new 5 year high today .
1248 2018-04-18 21:30:36 Or you can realize Venezuela went to shit because its entire economy was based on oil, not because it had expanded social programming.
1249 2018-04-18 21:30:30 It is time we have a major protest here the price of oil is up again the dollar is down the price of the pump was up our wages are down unless you’re the CEO of a large oil company it’s time we take this to the streets and say we’ve had enough

1255 2018-04-18 21:30:13 3% com 17% não tem relevância. O que é estranho acontecer é petro dividir por 2 e oil dobrar. 10 ou 20% pra lá ou pra cá é o mercado balançando conforme o humor de sempre.
1256 2018-04-18 21:30:01 The natural gas and oil industry has invested more than $339 billion into environmental enhancements and improving air quality. That's roughly:
1257 2018-04-18 21:29:39 Yeah! Oil up to 68 a barrel! Good incentive for electric cars!
1258 2018-04-18 21:29:34 I’d love Moroccan Oil and a new Make Up Forever Ultra HD foundation!
1259 2018-04-18 21:29:30 That’s wild did you use Jamaican castor oil in that fat bottle? That’s what I use tbh but I also take biotin and collagen pills everyday twice a day. I started taking it for my brittle nails cus I stopped getting my long gel tips BUT SLAY KWEEN
1260 2018-04-18 21:29:29 Check that oil...cause bad stuff happens if you don’t #glendaleharley #findyourfreedom #harleydavidson #harleydavidsonofglendale #supportyourlocaldealer  @ Harley-Davidson of Glendale

1265 2018-04-18 21:28:52 @LeGrosCuisenair 
I'm going to bake some butternut squash cut in half, seasoned and rubbed in olive oil. Can I leave the seeds in?
1266 2018-04-18 21:28:50 Saudis aiming for $100 oil to launch Aramco. With Russia on board OPEC can push prive anywhere it wants - as they did down to $26 to try and bankrupt shale. If they want $100 (on Brent) that’s what they’ll get
1267 2018-04-18 21:28:47 Nope. Not allowed to change the question after I answer.  You asked who I should most likely believe... based on how much money they make or whether they work for oil companies. Neither of those matter.
1268 2018-04-18 21:28:42 Not quite the independant report expected. I suspect some powerful interests don't want us to know much about local -vs- US based oil processing. Shipping unrefined to Cherry Point to get back refined is plain silly.
1269 2018-04-18 21:28:37 I will tell him you take it with oil, vinegar AND mayo.
1270 2018-04-18 21:28:31 #skpoli NDP took a $7,500 donation from John Horgan and B.C. NDP. Is Meili et. al. not supporting cutting off oil to B.C. because they are beholding to Horgan and Co.? asks @PremierScottMoe
1271 2018-04-18 21:28:31 I don’t wanna hear women crying about men not being able to change a tire, oil or be handy around a home when ya promote shit like this. Breeding soft men  in my opinion.
1272 2018-04-18 21:28:28 I heard coconut oil is good
1273 2018-04-18 21:28:26 lol well I’ve just been pulling them off so that oil is gonna rock my world lol & they definitely do hurt lmaoo the things we do to slay from time to time smh
1274 2018-04-18 21:28:15 people who cook with oil are braver than the us marines

1281 2018-04-18 21:27:21 I thought CAD liked strong oil 
1282 2018-04-18 21:27:15 NY State also doesn’t allow fracking for oil - Let’s Pennsylvania drink their milkshake
1283 2018-04-18 21:27:15 Denis Gartman?  Did he defend his call on oil?  Fake. Phony. Charlitan.

1287 2018-04-18 21:27:05 My sister in law works for an oil extraction company, she goes all over the world and strangely enough, other than the middle east, most of the places she goes there are either plenty of women or more women.  But that could just be the company she works for.
1288 2018-04-18 21:27:01 Farage is a snake oil salesman who is now openly flirting with wing nuts like Alex Jones.

He isn't a leader, he's a demagogue. All blame, no answers.

1290 2018-04-18 21:26:31 Shouldn’t these johnny reb fossils be turning into oil by now?
1291 2018-04-18 21:26:20 Fig Newtons started using palm oil and my dad is allergic so he called to ask them to go back to unnatural preservatives
1292 2018-04-18 21:26:18 Amen Cerno that is why America needs to break its dependence on arab oil which is the only reason we are engaged in region.  Saturday I take delivery of a Tesla Model 3 and so our family home and vehicles are no longer dependent on arab oil.

1295 2018-04-18 21:25:43 Anti oil and gas science is still science, no?
1296 2018-04-18 21:25:41 I need 2 experience oil field guys to contact me about working with me.
1297 2018-04-18 21:25:37 Bought myself a small personal oil diffuser aw :))))
1298 2018-04-18 21:25:28 Yeah, that’s what’ll happen. Whole city..... gigantic fireball....... from heavy oil.

1300 2018-04-18 21:25:23 isnt that crazy??almold oil gave me some thickness but no length, I use grandelash and my eyelashes can look fake now with just mascara. the little asian girl in me is thriving

1302 2018-04-18 21:25:00 It’s a “bathe in lemon oil” kind of day #wardoffthatnegativeenergy
1303 2018-04-18 21:24:56 I might grab something to eat after I get home I’m getting oil change now. Not sure where downtown tho
1304 2018-04-18 21:24:53 We all talk about the sense of entitlement of youths in the Niger Delta who would rather extort money from oil companies than work....but suddenly, they have become innovative, hardworking youths. 

Haha
1305 2018-04-18 21:24:51 Very nice nutritious oil but with 9000kcal per 100ml isn't that a recipe for a coronary?
1306 2018-04-18 21:24:32 Had a strange dream last night where somebody was trying to boil myself, Thor, and Iron Man in boiling oil. T'was nerve wracking, to say the least...
1307 2018-04-18 21:24:14 Oh fret ye not!
It has to go back to The House of Commons in a month to be voted on or something. 
So don't despair THC is full of snake oil salesmen who don't care about you or me.
You will get your blue passport, just hang on in there.
1308 2018-04-18 21:24:11 Further unpredictability in the Middle East and Venezuela will only add to higher oil prices over the course of this year, factor in trade wars, currency wars, and interest rate rises and there is a mix guaranteed to cause pain.
1309 2018-04-18 21:24:06 How did your government vote for Bill 9 ?   There are other issues in Alberta besides oil ..
1310 2018-04-18 21:23:55 Oil companies with armies
1311 2018-04-18 21:23:47 Oh wow, that's a relief from these snake oil salesmen.
1312 2018-04-18 21:23:44 are you telling me you can deep fry without oil
1313 2018-04-18 21:23:37 Millennials ruin everything, even Big Oil.
1314 2018-04-18 21:23:16 Yeah, just don’t get the oil curse....ie don’t follow the W African example....
1315 2018-04-18 21:23:13 yeah same lmao i would def recommend vitamin e for scarring then i use a needle to poke a hole in the pill then use it like an ointment (don’t get vitamin e oil idk wtf that would do to ur pores)
1316 2018-04-18 21:23:11 same with rain being plant oil
1317 2018-04-18 21:23:10 is it definitely animal derived? i think glycerin can come from veg oil too!
1318 2018-04-18 21:23:10 Need to include all companies with palm oil products who, knowing what they know, choose not to do the right thing, and continue to profit without penalty.
1319 2018-04-18 21:23:08 i used to have them, i highly recommend for you to not have these. they attract oil, hair, dirt, lent
1320 2018-04-18 21:23:06 bom, ai que entra a questão. Assim como outras empresas de oil e países com exportacoes dependentes de commodiies sofrem na queda, tem aqueles em q o pib(ou reseltado) sobe nada ou cai pouco e aqueles tipo brasil(ou PBR) q desaba.
1321 2018-04-18 21:22:51 Money/debt is a social construct.  Buy something finite.  Oil, gold, silver, Bitcoin etc.  >10x sales for an app has run it's course
1322 2018-04-18 21:22:43 Choosing a Secretary of the Interior who is in the process of selling off our public lands to mining operations.
Preparing to allow drilling for oil on our pristine coastlines. Threatening marine life, and those who depend on tourists for they're living
1323 2018-04-18 21:22:32 Yeah tbh I’ve never used shaving cream cus my mom always had coconut oil in the bathroom  Omg what I’ve never heard of that happening! :( I dilute it with water too. Try just almond oil maybe
1324 2018-04-18 21:22:29 So if the SCC says the Texas oil company's pipeline is in the national interest, he's okay with that?

I'm not.   I'm still opposed.
1325 2018-04-18 21:22:15 I suffer terrible with them! A few things that help migraines, eat a handful of almonds, sip coconut water, cucumber in your drinks or eat it, rub peppermint oil on temples, back of neck, and pressure points. They help me hope it helps you x
1326 2018-04-18 21:22:09 I gotta gets my oil changed next week 
1327 2018-04-18 21:22:07 coat the squirrel guard with olive oil.
1328 2018-04-18 21:21:50 What should have been done long ago is a refinery should have been built in Alberta that would refine bitumen. It should have been paid for by the Texan oil company that profits from it, not massive tax subsidies.
1329 2018-04-18 21:21:26 History has shown that when the price of oil is boiling, one should be recoiling from stocks. $SPX $NDX $IWM
1330 2018-04-18 21:21:25 Squalane oil for president
1331 2018-04-18 21:21:19 Roasted Brussels sprouts with olive oil. YUM!
1332 2018-04-18 21:21:14 and of course, the warm feeling of contributing to an increase in bitumen oil production...climate change? what me worry....
1333 2018-04-18 21:21:13 "Christian said Wednesday that the country has a “moral duty” to war veterans to drill for oil because it will further a long-held goal of energy independence."

So our Middle East misadventures really were about oil?
1334 2018-04-18 21:21:09 You must be getting desperate, trying to sell bone broth and snake oil.
1335 2018-04-18 21:21:02 Me: puts oil on face. 
Also me: uses oil control moisturiser.

1336 2018-04-18 21:21:00 Can't guys buy for themselves?
I use coconut oil too na 
1337 2018-04-18 21:20:58 U.S. stocks edged higher as investors parsed a mixed bag of earnings and rising oil prices boosted energy producers. Treasuries fell and the dollar advanced amid signs geopolitical tensions are easing.  Bloomberg
1338 2018-04-18 21:20:56 @charlesadler Well...you see..Jeff Rubin thought the government was running the oil industry.
1339 2018-04-18 21:20:54 same and for shaving??? no more razor bumps ever its so great. the only thing i disagree with is the castor oil for eyelashes, idk why but my lashes started falling out from castor oil it was so frightening lol
1340 2018-04-18 21:20:49 Well I wish them luck with that certainly. I don't believe the rainforests of Columbia would be safe if Palm Oil production took hold. We'll wait and see
1341 2018-04-18 21:20:45 I put cuticle oil on my nails last mo ke dira manala...my nails are not damaged  yaas
1342 2018-04-18 21:20:43 I would drizzle some of your chili oil over my Chargrilled Halloumi cheese slices that I enjoy on toasted sourdough with vine roasted tomatoes and green salad on the side....
1343 2018-04-18 21:20:41 he had this wonderful system for doing the garlic. He used a razor, and he used to slice it so thin that he used to liquefy in the pan with just a little oil. It was a very good system. — watching Goodfellas
1344 2018-04-18 21:20:40 My rear diff oil was actually black. I’m ashamed.
1345 2018-04-18 21:20:35 Peter, I think oil going up in Dollar terms is a tell that both the exclusivity as well as future dominance of oil being pegged to US Dollar is being challenged by the new, disruptive, petroyuan.
1346 2018-04-18 21:20:23 I’d make a beef stir fry and drizzle your  chilli oil over the mix whilst cooking 
1347 2018-04-18 21:20:21 Come to Massachusetts! The South Shore...where my friends & I bath in peanut oil just for fun!!!! Lmao
1348 2018-04-18 21:20:16 just don’t let it dry out. & if it does mix it with an oil!
1349 2018-04-18 21:20:12 So something dug up my buried betta fish and ate him so that’s good. Jokes on that animal- Pablo is filled with vodka and clove oil so it’s going to be drunk and sleepy
1350 2018-04-18 21:20:11 I just pushed a riding lawn mower a good distance and my pants smell like oil, and I'm sick.
1351 2018-04-18 21:19:59 Went to get an oil change at Firestone because it was free and asked for a tire rotation as well because I needed it but they didn't even rotate my tires. Tf ? They really thought that I wouldn't be able to tell. SMH
1352 2018-04-18 21:19:54 If that is the source of revenue for the state, then the need for state income tax and local taxes diminishes. While IL has a small amount of oil and coal production, they pale in comparison to TX. What sources of income should IL pursue if not state and local tax?

1354 2018-04-18 21:19:09 brownie mix fuckign sucks

1357 2018-04-18 21:18:49 I use coconut oil for everythinggg but right after I shower I put it all over my body and don’t need to keep re-applying lotion during the day
1358 2018-04-18 21:18:47 Normally it’s just normal with a slightly oily forehead, however, at the moment it’s full on oil EVERYWHERE.
1359 2018-04-18 21:18:37 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for pink clay mud masks, and put some plumeria essential oil in my diffuser.

1361 2018-04-18 21:18:28 oil that the US opposes geopolitically is inherently less polluting than other oil, that's science

1363 2018-04-18 21:18:20 bio oil is evil and does nothing lmao go for a coco butter with added vitamin E or a serum with vitamin E too. vit E helps with skin repair and is very helpful and nutritious for ur skin
1364 2018-04-18 21:18:16 Not really.  These systems tend to be tied in together and gas declines a lot slower than oil..main reason gas is at <$3 is because the gas production stubbornly doesn't deplete enough
1365 2018-04-18 21:18:06 wonder if qutar has heard of a little toy we have called MOAB's I hear we have a few and you know how crazy we Americans can be? & will leave no fall out can just walk in and take the oil? #MAGA
1366 2018-04-18 21:17:58 Strong gains for energy stocks helped the S&P 500 eke out a modest gain as oil prices hit fresh four-year highs, although financials lost ground.  FT
1367 2018-04-18 21:17:54 Brent crude oil hit a new record high today that is not seen since 2014.

Oil prices were supported by EIA report today that confirmed a decline in US crude oil inventory reported by API earlier this week.
1368 2018-04-18 21:17:48 ねっむ
1369 2018-04-18 21:17:48 Chile I have on so much coconut oil 
1370 2018-04-18 21:17:47 If they've plotted against Iraq because of their oil, I'll recall you you're the first oil producer of the planet..
1371 2018-04-18 21:17:41 I would make a chilli chicken salad by marinating the chicken in the chilli oil and then grilling it on the BBQ, served with a colourful salad and finished by a drizzle of chilli oil 
1372 2018-04-18 21:17:37 Uh ending Korean war,cutting taxes,oil exports,500k of food stamps this month alone,lowest unemployment ever among blacks and hispanics for starters.
1373 2018-04-18 21:17:35 and COCONUT OIL
1374 2018-04-18 21:17:28 Imagine if Indonesia grew soybeans instead of palm oil
1375 2018-04-18 21:17:28 He says we are lazy, a lot us haven't gone to school cos we are an oil producing nation, we want everything free.

This is unfair, considering how a lot of youths are working their ass off to contribute to the economy of this nation.

@TrafficChiefNG
1376 2018-04-18 21:17:23 I’ll tell you what the problem is. Big investors in both forms of energy fighting for dominance. If solar was made practical and cheap for homeowners, the market would force coal & oil out of business.
1377 2018-04-18 21:17:18 @kippstrawn obviously doesn't like the truth. Got to be kidding if you think those missiles did anything. Chemical attack was false flag. Missile were to make the Saudis happy so US keeps getting it's oil.
1378 2018-04-18 21:17:10 I know there are a lot of people back east as far as Newfoundland and many more here in Alberta who would love to still be working in oil and gas to them I say tell your friends and family what the NDP and the liberal government's have done to Alberta what they have done to you!!
1379 2018-04-18 21:17:08 Ok, so let's dig in a little more. TX has a huge oil industry, as well as a booming tech industry, and other sources of revenue to the state. Presumably, those industries are paying taxes to the state (although I do confess I don't know that for a fact).
1380 2018-04-18 21:17:00 I cannot believe the difference of growth in my lashes after using castor oil!! Now ma brows just gotta catch up #thicc

1384 2018-04-18 21:16:47 They’re  not interested in this line. It brings foreign oil in, not Cdn oil out. The plan of the eco zealots is to land-lock Cdn oil/gas to keep us out of the international market & sell to US for crazy low prices. This ensures Americans reap money like bandits! @FairQuestions

1386 2018-04-18 21:16:41 Someone that can't diversify his economy, who's whole government depends on this same oil, is trying to preach oil independence to people. Even those that listened at that house, all of them are insane. We waiting u at the pool...

1400 2018-04-18 21:14:50 The unpalatable news that Greeted Nigerians dis morning from the Senate was bad.

But what the President of our Federal Republic said about its Youth is the Worse i have had anywhere. 

"Nigerian Youths are Lazy b'cos of Oil Money" Have we even seen any dividend from Oil money?
1401 2018-04-18 21:14:46 Um...palm oil is cheap because you can harvest every three weeks compared to soy or rapeseed which harvests once a year. Plus, the Indonesian farmer is happy to get 10 cents Euro per kilo because it's a good price compared to rice or rubber

Don't worry about the impressive unemployment, the shitty logistics with the Continent, or that #Italia sold the sea in front of it to #France for oil/gas drilling, or wants to dump there #nukes wastes. Who cares, if you can have a new stadium!
1404 2018-04-18 21:14:08 My wallet is bleeding because the oil industry has stopped
1405 2018-04-18 21:14:05 My daughter wanted to take bikes to ice cream on Hyperion and I had to do the say the same thing. Instead we contributed towards big oil. Just remember our local Silver Lake neighborhood council has done all they can to make sure it's not safe for our kids (or us) to ride.

1414 2018-04-18 21:13:09 The whole process was globalists' destabilization of the entire Mideast. Those strong dictators had control of the oil and the global oil marketers wanted to destroy that so the corporations would have more free rein.

1415 2018-04-18 21:13:04 Just got the list of Houston's top 100 companies by revenue in 2017. Only 15 companies reported a revenue drop last year. Big improvement after the oil bust.

1420 2018-04-18 21:12:31 So it's more likely to you that climate scientists are fiddling data for ~75k a year, while the scientists taking massive salaries from oil, gas, and chemical companies are the ones telling the truth, and have your best interests at heart? Stay in school kids..

1422 2018-04-18 21:12:24 The oil industry and its deep-pocketed American owners have shamelessly manhandled gullible Cdn politicians to build a pipeline no one wants to carry bitumen no one needs.

1426 2018-04-18 21:12:07 Benign neglect equals an open door to strategic adversaries, no?  Terror containment, non-proliferation, weapons exports, Israel protection, oil issues must be strategic goals.
1427 2018-04-18 21:11:59 Those people of which you speak have probably done so for centuries. 150,000 orangutang have been killed in Indonesia since 2002. #PalmOil is to blame for orangutang being put on the critically endangered list. Palm oil does not help poor people that's why it's so cheap

1435 2018-04-18 21:10:46 Something about the oil in peanuts!
1436 2018-04-18 21:10:43 Their conduct is stunning in its viciousness to protect American big oil interests.  They should be ashamed of themselves. Canadians need to send them a clear message this behaviour will not be tolerated in Canada.
1437 2018-04-18 21:10:41 Exactly! And I'm still not sure that Bush shouldn't be prosecuted for allowing torture and basic genocide.

1443 2018-04-18 21:10:07 Those are the vape pen cartridges. You get a "battery" they refer to the bottom piece. You push a button and it lights up the oil. Another way of using cannabis. I use one when I'm out

1445 2018-04-18 21:09:57 I guess your not familir with free trade and how it works. Keeping oil in Canada would completely defeat the purpose of expansion. We’d lose tons. I am not for or against the pipeline by any amount and see the pros and cons of it. Not trading it would be a significant GDP loss.
1446 2018-04-18 21:09:55 The oil, too. Looks like a winner.

1451 2018-04-18 21:09:18 This is so disappointing. I wish there was a way we could support sustainable development and renewable energy. Though the biggest burden to solving climate change isn’t on developing nations - new oil in 2018 is not cool.

1453 2018-04-18 21:09:13 Independent Petroleum Association of America, propaganda mouthpiece of the energy industry, one of the largest energy contributors to congress. Basically they're a political wing of the oil industry, which is why they are focusing on trying to discredit environmentalists.
1454 2018-04-18 21:08:58 Oil & gas have had at least a decade (we know they've known for longer though) to consider their part in climate change. They've sat on their hands and done nothing.

1465 2018-04-18 21:07:47 Madness. Here's the future. Subsidies that underpin renewable energy will cease as high levels of Govt debt impact. Myth of man caused climate change will be exposed as a fraud. Cheap energy (oil & coal) will return. Bottom line. Money sustaining the fairy tale fast running out.

1485 2018-04-18 21:06:10 In fact, oil and hydrocarbons will be around for hundreds of years still. It's called limiting our use. Not stopping. What greases all the bearings in windmills? What are solar panels made out of? That plant N of Edm, makes plastic pellets, so you can type on your keyboard now..
1486 2018-04-18 21:06:07 Yeh agreed. I was looking for green alts for acrylic the other day and they do green cast acrylic which is 100% recycled. I wonder if you could polymerise a veg oil at home... Goes googling
1487 2018-04-18 21:05:40 Wrong canola, palm oil, sunflower oil are all substitutes for soy oil and they are not cheap. guess what they all generate a stockfeed byproduct. Please learn why crops are grown and how  your food is produced. You will be a better human for it.

1520 2018-04-18 21:02:13 I feel like every time I come for a simple oil change they try to take advantage and tell me I need all this stuff done to my car 
1521 2018-04-18 21:02:12 Some size Ronnie. Looks like ‘out with the oil, in with the wind!’

1526 2018-04-18 21:01:51 We get a theater-based rise (which was all it was) and the #OOTTmoron s pushing 80-100 come out of the wood works. Some probably are Saudi or hedge fund backed. Many are Madani trolls. Just remember to ask Madani who really funds tanker trackers #WTI #OOTT #Oil #CrudeOil #Brent
1527 2018-04-18 21:01:36 British Columbians aren't attacking anybody! They are being bullied by a foreign oil company, Justin and Alberta because they don't want the huge high pressure pipeline through Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley drinking water sources!  No more supertanker!

1531 2018-04-18 21:00:47 I don’t support industrial farming. I produce all our meat and most veg and fruits. I buy local produce. I don’t ever use soya bean or palm oil products. Best you can do is join an angry offensive cult fueled by propaganda and call me stupid

1552 2018-04-18 20:59:23 So importing oil from the middle east is a better suggestion? How about Vancouver Airport bringing in tankers of jet fuel. Where's your outrage on that. You hypocrite!

1556 2018-04-18 20:58:58 Wrong. Why do they build huge processing facilities to extract oil ?
1557 2018-04-18 20:58:57 Chinese Government wants Canada’s oil. Rich Canadians want to sell it to them. Don’t get in the way or you will get clubbed, Pepper sprayed and thrown in jail.
1558 2018-04-18 20:58:56 Do you have a knife, potatoes, a heat source, a cooking vessel and oil?  Will the thought of you using those items in tandem terrify her?
1559 2018-04-18 20:58:50 I'm out of tea tree oil. How am I suppose to get my life together now?!
1560 2018-04-18 20:58:45 Current situation is = 50/50
IF there is an growth:
 - then it will be sharp = until the end of this month.
The goal, that crude oil wants to achieve = $ 87 until the end of June.
    (but this does not mean that it will reach these levels)
1561 2018-04-18 20:58:38 shit left my favorite sun oil at @MadisonKing02 ‘s
1562 2018-04-18 20:58:36 still aren’t don’t changing my oil
1563 2018-04-18 20:58:30 I realized cooking wasn't my best quality when I thought it'd be smart to throw in all the fries into the oil at the same time so I could put them in quicker. Nearly burned my eyebrows off that day, no cap.
1564 2018-04-18 20:58:20 That’s a lovely picture- you’re all shiny in the sun! Is that the suntan oil?
1565 2018-04-18 20:58:00 Peppermint oil does wonders for your scalp
1566 2018-04-18 20:57:59 Also our sorbent is non toxic, aggregates with oil on contact, and can be reused after oil recovered
1567 2018-04-18 20:57:57 Fresh oil
1568 2018-04-18 20:57:51 I love when I go in to have my cars coolant replaced and then I’m told I need a new compressor, motor and transmission in the next six months. Oh and I still need an oil change
1569 2018-04-18 20:57:47 I used to say the same thing, but my daughter converted me, cut in half put in a bowl add a little olive oil and salt and pepper stir, put on a baking sheet in an oven 375 for half hour. It’s great honest
1570 2018-04-18 20:57:45 so no one was gonna tell me you’re supposed to get an oil change every 3 months?  at this point why do i have a car

1573 2018-04-18 20:57:40 The price of North American oil benchmark closed above $68 a barrel today - highest price since 2014. #oilprice

1576 2018-04-18 20:57:33 inventories are helping to keep it alive, with an industry report saying stockpiles fell last week. OPEC and Russia are due to meet in Saudi Arabia this week, and despite the success of their production cuts in eliminating the global oil glut, , for now.
1577 2018-04-18 20:57:29 Sorry Izzy, but calling for an end to the oil-sands will not help climate change. What it will do it decrease the prosperity of Canada and increase the prosperity of oil producing countries with few environmental controls.
1578 2018-04-18 20:57:28 Look, the people who bought the snake oil still believe it will cure them.
1579 2018-04-18 20:57:22 Why is the guy doing my oil change talking about gays and saying it’s nasty. Bitch. Do my oil change before I fuck you up.
1580 2018-04-18 20:57:11 Send him back to Canada, but drain his hair first or charge him a tariff for exporting Texas oil.

1582 2018-04-18 20:57:02 Definitely want to convert back to a natural skin care regimen for my face and body. I’m currently using Tata Harper for my face, I want some REAL 100% shea butter and coconut oil for the summer for my body.
1583 2018-04-18 20:57:01 Why is it that every single biopic about a painter has some scene with them painting super angrily. Short of like Jackson Pollock who physically had to run around his canvas to paint like y'all know nobody sits down all angry at a canvas with frickin' oil paints right.
1584 2018-04-18 20:57:01 Harper did it, other than oil jobs during a boom, Nothing was accomplished. It doesn’t work.
1585 2018-04-18 20:56:41 @fad56, it's only going up based on theater. We have more oil in US inventories than we did at the beginning of the year. There is nothing bullish here. You are unable to tell us how it's fundamentally bullish. You're just working for Madani because he got exposed. BLOCKED!

Historically Eastern Canada paid a premium for Western oil.  I'll bet they would again for non-bitumen oil if we had a national energy plan.

1595 2018-04-18 20:55:55 People can be so inconsiderate. 

My grandma has always carries around a small bottle of vanilla oil (sometimes cinnamon) to put under her nose in case something smells off.
1596 2018-04-18 20:55:44 Oil closes above $68 a barrel, highest price since 2014
1597 2018-04-18 20:55:43 Today I am grateful for my beautiful friend who brought around an oil blend each for my big girl and I to help with anxiety and sleep.  I feel so blessed to be friends with such a kind, caring and amazing lady.
1598 2018-04-18 20:55:34 I'd like to respond to that sarcastically: Yes, I relish the thought of a stranger covering my body with oil and rubbing it.
1599 2018-04-18 20:55:10 Yes, sure. I haven’t seen any Native Americans that I follow mention the show. They have their hands full trying to keep oil pipelines from being laid across their lands.
1600 2018-04-18 20:55:09 So is it like. SS oil?
1601 2018-04-18 20:55:07 If I come for an oil change, I want my fluids topped off, tires rotated, and oil changed. But since I don't know Jack about cars...tell me what's wrong so I can take it to someone else for verification

1617 2018-04-18 20:53:49 No new manufacture of fossil-fueled cars; people can buy electric or used. Heavily tax luxury items, plastics, & other carbon-intensive products, but end taxes on local, sustainably-produced items. End all new oil drilling; *require* solar R&D instead.

1623 2018-04-18 20:53:08 Need oil for quite a while. How are you going to replace fertilizer, made by Hydrocarbons to feed the world. And the 1000's of other products we need. It's a highly nuanced situation. And being Canada, with our winter's will be more of a challenge.
1624 2018-04-18 20:53:01 Hah, I didn't put the kitchen light on just now because of lazy and nearly poured vegetable oil in my glass rather than squash.
1625 2018-04-18 20:52:49 Capacity comparable, but lower than some high surface area foams and fibres. Advantages in cost (cheap and sustainable feedstocks), low water uptake, buoyancy and oil recovery.
1626 2018-04-18 20:52:44 Good thing I mositurize with coconut oil
1627 2018-04-18 20:52:42 >pipelines
good idea of transportation, considerably safer
bad for local wildlife and people who gotta be relocated, especially when the oil doesn’t stay in the country
1628 2018-04-18 20:52:38 Canadian taxpayer dollars ought to be put towards Canadians, not towards bailouts for American oil corporations. This money could be better spent investing in struggling First Nations communities, green energy initiatives, and so many other projects. We MUST do better. #StopKM

1636 2018-04-18 20:51:42 A cost is something you pay. .It doesn't "cost" if it is something you never had. Don't count money you don't have. 

The construction phase of the oil sands is now largely over. That won't be coming back.
1637 2018-04-18 20:51:37 There are colonies of tiny mites living on your face, feasting on the oil that comes out of your pores.
1638 2018-04-18 20:51:21 So, are you saying we’re NEVER going to transition off oil/petroleum? Climate change doesn’t matter? What’s YOUR plan for my children’s future? I won’t hold my breath for a reply!

1642 2018-04-18 20:50:52 All these ppl are hating on oil pipelines but I don’t think a lot of them look at what routes a lot of oil is shipped
Which isssss by train
In containers that aren’t insulated so it’s dangerous
1643 2018-04-18 20:50:50 InfoChip is the only custom ID provider focused on providing heavy-duty tags for the oil & gas markets.
1644 2018-04-18 20:50:50 The first thing I thought when I heard this was exactly what Ezra said. Giving the NDP control of our oil production would be a huge mistake. 2019 can't come soon enough.

1653 2018-04-18 20:49:32 The issues raised in that article is exactly why certified palmoil from @RSPOtweets is so important. There's palm oil for peace to replace cocaine crops. There's palm oil that pays workers and small farmers good incomes. That's from @RSPOtweets

1655 2018-04-18 20:49:14 So, what should I do Norman?
After years of arthritis, when I took fish oil, in desperation and without any expectation of success, pain dramatically diminished.
When I stored for surgery pain returned.
Should I stop because they don't work. 1/2
1656 2018-04-18 20:49:14 I feel like I am currently running on coconut oil.
1657 2018-04-18 20:49:10 Oil is about to hit $70/bbl. that is when North American frackers and oil sand producers will save the day. Soon, we will not have to import oil. #Fracking #oilsands

1659 2018-04-18 20:49:07 I agree. CBD oil is wonderful! You can get it in tincture form and use it as is or add it to food. It helps with my RA pain!
1660 2018-04-18 20:49:03 I want to take a triptan for my migraine, but it gets me tripping and keeps me awake for hours, so I got ice on my neck and mint oil on my forehead instead.
1661 2018-04-18 20:48:54 oil got to $100 not from supply demand issue but because hedge funds saw it as a nice alternative investment

1662 2018-04-18 20:48:51 Do white people realize that when you mash avocado with garlic,olive oil and tahina it doesn’t make it “avocado hummus”?

Hummus is LITERALLY chickpeas..

You can’t have “Hummus” without putting actual hummus in it...

1666 2018-04-18 20:47:45 This could have been painted with an oil based paint prior to your moving in. The only way to get rid would be to kilz paint over it. If your having no other para issues it could be hat you have that someone has done this and others tried to paint too with no success. I see it.
1667 2018-04-18 20:47:37 Liv and I did too and leant lots about palm oil

1669 2018-04-18 20:47:29 Well I would rather inspection services, vet services, infrastructure,health care, improvements to indigenous issues, military etc. Our economy is fine without oil production, we are diversifying which we should have done a long time ago.

1699 2018-04-18 20:43:49 Yes but it is a function of scale . 9B+ people to feed by 2050 and 2B cars on the road plus 90M new vehicles annually. A few new windmills or solar won’t suffice !! 2/3 of all energy use today is coal, gas or oil so that transition will take many decades likely at least a century
1700 2018-04-18 20:43:47 Have you heard about a pipeline in Vancouver coming from Asia? We're buying oil from Asia and allowing them to build a pipeline? Or should I say the NDP are. Is this true? Why don't these things get discussed?

Maybe that would reduce my turmoil.

1734 2018-04-18 20:40:55 look great! but thats not a question id be comfortable answering, if i wanted to give that a more 'oil' look, id paint it in oils. Im generally pretty okay with my digital stuff looking very digital. oils paintings can look DRASTICALLY different depending on how a person paints

1741 2018-04-18 20:40:16 I agree. Unfortunately we still rely on oil for all our needs and wants. It’s in the very fibre of our consumption to technology, transportation, housing, farming...until we start looking for alternative resources and implement them we have no other choice. It’s a mute argument
1742 2018-04-18 20:40:11 プールとか入るとよくわからないけど凄まじい勢いで浮くよ。

1745 2018-04-18 20:39:37 Andrew, you are wasting the House's time and our taxes with those foolish questions leading nowhere. How about important issues. He can't phase out oil tomorrow anymore than you can. Rhetorical. Our poor Conservative Party rudderless.
1746 2018-04-18 20:39:26 Because everyone knows oil is the future. I'm pretty sure the Enterprise runs on it in Star Trek.
1747 2018-04-18 20:39:18 Being a chef in a kitchen means sacrificing all your clothes to oil stains, burning off your finger prints and gaining resistance to cutting onions.
1748 2018-04-18 20:39:10 It's like asking your mechanic to give you a free oil change. He needs  to still be able to pay the bills.

Both the mechanic and SW can oil up and lube your chassis, but only one puts a smile on my face.

1750 2018-04-18 20:38:50 I think the issue is how to deal with the uk. UK it appears is shitless that Russia has started to sell some of its oil in chinese currency rather than US$, this will see a big drop in both dollar and pound over the coming months. Russia is worlds biggest producer of oil.
1751 2018-04-18 20:38:49 People voted on issues. That's called DEMOCRACY. I voted against Bernier because of his positions on supply management and healthcare, not because I agree with the status quo, but because I felt that Andrew's stance on free speech and foreign oil were more important right now.
1752 2018-04-18 20:38:44 Absolutely . I think that is the case both for U.K. stocks ( which were lagging ) and US sector too . Premier Oil’s (just one example) , Ebitda at this rate could easily be double last year’s .

1771 2018-04-18 20:37:09 Yes but the costs of climate change will outpace any benefits soon. Sometimes it's just the right thing to do, even if it's hard to do. It also highlights our dependency on oil, which is a little embarrassing given we have an abundance of green energies possibilities.

It would hit native communities and water protectors hardest. Tell #mnleg that’s not how MN works. #mnvalues, not corporate influence. @GovMarkDayton @EricLucerMN
1791 2018-04-18 20:35:11 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?

1793 2018-04-18 20:35:06 If it fails, vaping on an oil rig off the coast would be far safer than having someone with a traditional cigarette. So the combo may save lives upon defeat.
1794 2018-04-18 20:35:01 It's kinda like the snake oil salesmen or saleswoman or salesperson whatever she full of shit!
1795 2018-04-18 20:34:59 - Shave w coconut oil or any conditioner for a closer shave
- Switch out ur razors wenever they start to not shave very well
1796 2018-04-18 20:34:58 WTI oil rises above $68/barrel for the first time since December 2014 - now at $68.04/barrel, up $1.52.

(one day in the finest cloths after being anointed in oil)
1799 2018-04-18 20:34:49 When China buys stolen oil and iron ore from cartels and Mexican govt can’t do anything about it... it calls into question Mexico political apparatus
1800 2018-04-18 20:34:45 Keep that nasty oil in Canada!
1801 2018-04-18 20:34:38 I've only spent one year covering the Oil Kings and never once heard Chiarellis name fwiw
1802 2018-04-18 20:34:34 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
1803 2018-04-18 20:34:16 SHAME on ALL YOU #Canadians if the #Angusreid polls are even correct... that want #Transmountain to go ahead IT exploits #Tarsands Dirtiest Oil on Earth ... exasperating #Climatechange .. probably can #vote more then once faulty.. Regardless #FirstNations will have the last word
1804 2018-04-18 20:34:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i started crying over pizza please let most of beer off the genius works
1805 2018-04-18 20:33:57 No but we import oil from bad places  no environmental standards, no labor standards  poor human rights standards & may support terrorists. Keep that oil in the ground! CND oil is working hard 2 lower the carbon footprint. Canada is the standard. other countries not so much!
1806 2018-04-18 20:33:37 As much as I love our forests, they can't compare to the broad leaf trees in the tropics for carbon soaking. It's why I pray these tropical countries don't make the mistake of rejecting controversial palm oil over soy or sunflower oil
1807 2018-04-18 20:33:23 In that case, every other team apart from city has gone all arsenal, cos they can and will blow everyone out of the water with their oil money.
1808 2018-04-18 20:33:04 Cbd oil is sort of helping though
1809 2018-04-18 20:32:56 I beg your pardon Kai but you are quite wrong. It is only steamed brussels sprouts that are disgusting. Roasted or otherwise cooked with oil are amazing.
1810 2018-04-18 20:32:34 Psalm 55:21
Her speech was smoother than butter, But her heart was war; Her words were softer than oil, Yet they were drawn swords.
1811 2018-04-18 20:32:32 I would use the chilli oil to marinate the meat before putting on the BBQ 
1812 2018-04-18 20:32:24 Just get an oil change and rotation, they’ll rest it. You’re good
1813 2018-04-18 20:32:22 Dawg knocked his head off for some silk quilts, metals and oil. Guess we the 3 kings and shit.
1814 2018-04-18 20:32:20 Where is all the us oil??? We were going to flood the market to break opec ???
1815 2018-04-18 20:32:08 Which naked truth his he talking about over 8 million graduates unemployed are waiting for free oil money ?
1816 2018-04-18 20:32:07 My mates in Europe still feed, clothe & even go on vacation without holding jobs bcause their government pay them 4rm their oil wealth, some hold more than one job, jobs created 4rm oil wealth. U denied ur own youths these. God will judge all of you-PDP & APC
1817 2018-04-18 20:32:01 Hannity is in it for the power and the money. And Trump supporters are the chopped meat behind the gravy train. Hannity is a con man just like the guy who tries to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge - and Trump is his snake oil.
1818 2018-04-18 20:31:52 For those of us with sensitive palates, using mayo on grilled cheese just ends up tasting like oil. Sure, it'll brown nicely, but it'll miss all the nutty flavor that only butter can give. 0/10 recommend.
1819 2018-04-18 20:31:45 Fact.Tory/Brexefluenter's sold 'W.O.M.D's to: Saudi Despots. & so did Orange Fuherer Trumps. Genocidal Saudi's. Sold prementioned weapons on to 'I.S. Putin used as a diversion. To 'Privatize'/Piratise Syrian Oil Assets.'

1821 2018-04-18 20:31:33 Yes! To save space they decided to merge Amendments, thus oil drilling and vaping are the same vote
1822 2018-04-18 20:31:30 - every time I change my oil - 

mechanics: “this is wrong, this needs fixing, you need more of this, this is broken, you’re basically gonna die driving this car etc etc”

me: “I know I suck and so does my car plz just change my dang oil for $17.99”
1823 2018-04-18 20:31:18 Too bad oil prices are at 3 year highs. 

I didn't see what US $$$ are doing today.
1824 2018-04-18 20:31:17 Curro es lo que hacen las eléctricas generando con fuel oil y cobrando fortunas en transporte de electricidad desde hidroeléctricas. La autogeneración, entre invierno y verano, puede reducir hasta 70% el consumo de red y eso no quiere Macri
1825 2018-04-18 20:31:14 Brennen went to take my car to get an oil change and it turns out my gas lines are leaking :)))))
1826 2018-04-18 20:31:13 Cash flow and profits should be materially higher this year. Equities behind the curve. If oil sticks above 65 for a while will boost confidence
1827 2018-04-18 20:31:10 niggas and time is like oil and water smh
1828 2018-04-18 20:30:55 I should start a website that posts financial headlines before the headlines "Japan in strong demand as Trump and Abe pen a deal."  "Gold up on dollar devaluing because no one in the world can stop spending and now rates are rising."  "Oil up because saudis still control oil."

1832 2018-04-18 20:30:38 Oil Of Ulay is supposed to reduce the signs of aging. But what about becoming more right wing and racist as you get older? Those are the worrying ones.

1836 2018-04-18 20:30:20 Just spilled sesame oil all over my counter then used orange scented degreaser to get it all off and now my kitchen smells like a Panda Express AMA.
1837 2018-04-18 20:29:59 Doing this hot oil treatment on my head .

Hey buddy just me again....just wonder how #AMER is looking now on your algorithms? Big up turn in volume and SP this week after the impressive Full ResultsWith OIL rallying & drilling starting soon seems like it could be the perfect storm for Amerisur Resources
1842 2018-04-18 20:29:28 Not happy about the price of oil
WTF ?
1843 2018-04-18 20:29:25 Drizzle with a bit of olive oil, some balsamic, and whiskey, roast at 475 degrees.

Also good treatment for garlic, onions, parsnips, broccoli, mushrooms, peppers, baby artichokes, etc.
1844 2018-04-18 20:29:12 Of course he does. This is what would have been done if we had not had a Texas/Israeli petroleum cabal running the US in 1990. An Arab alliance of OBL's an army not destined to fight a war for Palestine but to protect the oil revenues of the Golan Heights, Kuwait. Kurdistan etc.
1845 2018-04-18 20:29:07 Which fish oil were you taking?
1846 2018-04-18 20:28:54 Why ? They keep saying U.S. oil production  at all time!

1851 2018-04-18 20:28:43 All day at work I sat in a chair watching meetings that were super boring on standards based grading..for 5 hours...now I’m sitting at the car dealership waiting for an oil change...1.25 hours. #whataboringday
1852 2018-04-18 20:28:39 It would be nice for both usa and uk paid bacck iraq, as iraq didn't have wmd but half a million iraqy were killed due to both usa and uk not wanting saddam to sell iraqs oil in euro.
1853 2018-04-18 20:28:05 Delish! Come on! Sliced in half, sautéed with some onions, olive oil, tahini and a little pancetta, they friggin RULE!
1854 2018-04-18 20:28:03 I said that the £:$ rate was 1:43 in June 2016 and is the same today.

And the dollar is the world's de facto standard trading currency. 

For example. oil trades are priced in dollars. And gold.  And wheat.

It is by far the most important currency against which to measure.
1855 2018-04-18 20:28:02 Scrubbed my body & put shower oil on so I feel so soft
1856 2018-04-18 20:28:00 Literally yes!!! I’m telling you that sheamoisture and Mario badescu is the BEST THING FOR YOUR SKIN!

1860 2018-04-18 20:27:35 He's welcome to work out in the oil fields with us on 13+ hr days... Lol. I'm not becoming more conservative as I get older..(F trump)  I'm just starting to understand why people outside those "star bubbles" loathe them so much.
1861 2018-04-18 20:27:28 God will judge all of you for the emotional trauma & physical hunger the Nigerian youth even graduates undergo for denying them jobs that should have been provided from the oil wealth.
1862 2018-04-18 20:27:11 I can fuck girls but finding one in the area that wants to oil up my butt and give me spankings is apparently hard for some reason.... Why no ladies wanna spank me? Have I not been bad enough lol
1863 2018-04-18 20:27:10 @Gidi_Traffic "More than 60% of Nigerian population is below 30,a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.”-PMB
1864 2018-04-18 20:27:01 Absolutely disgraceful to bail out big foreign oil giant while denying Canadians & Indigenous basic services coz we can’t afford it . Trudeau told Vets they were asking more than Govt could afford
1865 2018-04-18 20:26:58 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
1866 2018-04-18 20:26:46 If you want to turn them off you go into the main menu, under maintenance and reset oil and tire rotation. You’ll still have to get an oil change and tire rotation tho. LOL
1867 2018-04-18 20:26:38 Saddam & Gaddafi were about to jettison $us dollar & set up their own trading standard. 600k innocent ppl lost their lives in a concocted sham war for oil. We seeing evidence already that there were no chemical weapons dropped in Syria. Meanwhile the Saudis are using em in Yemen

1870 2018-04-18 20:26:35 A4 If data is the new oil, why wouldn't a company own their own data? #adobechat
1871 2018-04-18 20:26:31 but for reals, you probably just need an oil change/tire rotation.
1872 2018-04-18 20:26:31 The first world's massive shift away from petroleum could make its price rise more or less permanently.  In 1970, who would've imagined that oil might become a niche commodity, and a luxury for the few?
1873 2018-04-18 20:26:20 Fantastic newa for electric cars. 69 its fantastic, 100 will be amazing, let's go. in a short future where will u sell the oil??
1874 2018-04-18 20:26:15 Key Words:

1875 2018-04-18 20:26:14 No, but you can use whale oil, beef hooked 
1876 2018-04-18 20:26:00 It is just saying that the set mileage for an Oil Change is due same with Tire rotation or tire mileage, you just need to look in the manual to figure out how to reset it. And go get an oil change.
1877 2018-04-18 20:26:00 some guy just threatened his friend by sayin “ i WILL cover you in canola oil” and im ?
1878 2018-04-18 20:25:53 congratulations Miracle, the oil on your head is not vegetable oil, You are born a champion. will double my  sms  votes for you this night. Please keep sending VOTE Miracle to 32052.  #Miracleforthemoney #bbnaija

1880 2018-04-18 20:25:36 I never said anyone would get anything.  I used that as proof that I'm not the only one who thinks they are responsible for 911. But I do agree with you.  Our politicians need to stop bowing down to them because of oil and money.
1881 2018-04-18 20:25:29 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
1882 2018-04-18 20:25:27 Those are the pre set indicators that you need to get an oil change and tire rotation.  They are set for a certain mile amount
1883 2018-04-18 20:25:26 God will judge you for denying the Nigerian youth the opportunity of a secured future and jobs that would have been rather provided from the oil wealth all of you squandered.
1884 2018-04-18 20:25:23 How much money did John Cronyn make out of Iraq War? That war was to steal Iraq OIL? How many killed, or legs or arms blown off ? Why do republicans never fight in wars?
1885 2018-04-18 20:25:22 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines

1890 2018-04-18 20:24:40 We need to start a #metoo hashtag for countries that have been slaughtered to advance the interests of evil people who just want oil and to maintain their billions in dollars of wealth. 
Syria: #metoo
1891 2018-04-18 20:24:38 @SuperdrugHelp I bought a Barry m lip oil today, &the tube doesn’t have an internal stopper at the top of it. ive bought them before & they’re supposed to. not having one means all the product has just spilled out. is there a way to exchange it for a new one? I have the receipt.
1892 2018-04-18 20:24:37 Je comprend rien 
1893 2018-04-18 20:24:30 It’s technically legal but there is no where to get it until September (supposedly).  We have low grade CBD oil that does nothing.

1896 2018-04-18 20:24:20 Yea but I touch oil and shit so it might not come out all the time 
1897 2018-04-18 20:24:20 it IS possible to talk about the positive effects of CBD oil or recreational marijuana WITHOUT bashing pharmaceuticals.... just so y’all know
1898 2018-04-18 20:24:19 ありがたや！ありがたや！
1899 2018-04-18 20:24:13 Thanks George, it's massive, I thought it was something to do with oil rigs. 
1900 2018-04-18 20:23:56 It wasn’t silvers kick that sent oil up t stairs but gold twerking it’s little finger.
1901 2018-04-18 20:23:55 Omfg I just made fried rice with leftovers from dinner last night. It has crispy chicken thighs, rainbow chard, garlic, ginger, onions, egg and sesame oil in it and I’m in heeeeaAaaaavvveeeen
1902 2018-04-18 20:23:52 Beard Shampoo and Conditioner to keep your beard clean, fresh and moisturised. Nourish it with your beard oil, balm or butter of choice while it's moist. Not wet, not dry. Moist. Then either wooden comb or boar hair bristle brush that bad boy.
1903 2018-04-18 20:23:45 which oil?
1904 2018-04-18 20:23:43 my roommates are great EXCEPT FOR THEIR KITCHEN ETIQUETTE. i just had to rewatch EVERY SINGLE THING in our drying rack because NONE of them were clean. and they NEVER wipe down counters!!! are they pouring oil onto them? that’s what it seems like honestly
1905 2018-04-18 20:23:28 I'm sure he does wish we could phase out the oil industry. Would be a good thing. But he like most people know it can't be done for a long time.
1906 2018-04-18 20:23:26 When you want to stop a pipeline, you want it done yesterday. 

But when it comes to outrageous rent and unaffordable houses, it's spread over 120 months. 

Why is oil more of a priority to the BCNDP than poverty, homelessness or  a living wage?
1907 2018-04-18 20:23:16 Be out here saying “glow” but lookin like an oil spill. No ma’am.
1908 2018-04-18 20:23:13 Difficult to read Total's mind (can they themselves?), but many oil majors have understood : power is becoming key to their business and power is quite different from oil or even gas. Some are then ready to pay up for the privilege of being in power. EDF market cap looks odd now.
1909 2018-04-18 20:23:09 With all the rubbish this man said at the summits, I think Nigerians have to start THINKING. Who and Who is Benefiting from the oil ? Senseless Leaders
1910 2018-04-18 20:22:56 You do realize Saddam burned the oil and cause an environmental disaster
1911 2018-04-18 20:22:55 Why do you like oil so much, other than political reasons?
1912 2018-04-18 20:22:49 And another idiot peddles the Tory lie. Just as with Afganistan, there are no WMD or Chemical Weapons but it suits the West in their quest to build an Oil Pipeline across Europe & through Syria to keep the Russian Pipeline behind schedule
1913 2018-04-18 20:22:48 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
1914 2018-04-18 20:22:36 I would guess you have a tire low on air pressure. They should check when you have your oil changed

1918 2018-04-18 20:22:25 called my man an he want his oil back.
1919 2018-04-18 20:22:09 Yet half are against #KinderMorgan. i would hardly call that a success for Alberta or their big oil masters. FN, Burnaby, and Vancouver are against tar sands reaching the coast. That is a fact. #StopKM #ProtectTheInlet #AlbertaBullies #AlbertaWhine #cdnpoli #Resistance
1920 2018-04-18 20:21:57 $3 gasoline is coming soon as demand jumps and crude oil prices rise #Forex
1921 2018-04-18 20:21:47 Why is no company standing up and saying we will fix #PuertoRico.  Wouldn’t it be awesome if some solar company or something other than big oil/gas bit the bullet and made PR run on solar electricity with out worrying about contracts and backdoor payments
1922 2018-04-18 20:21:42 I know you have it all under control but be careful as HYGs have been strong and suggest Spooz still are about 21 points cheap.. oil is driving this hard as you know. Cheers & good luck Doug!
1923 2018-04-18 20:21:37 There was a time when I bought fish oil capsules ...

... and then realised that this was penguin food I was stealing.
1924 2018-04-18 20:21:37 They told me that the first thing they was told to do was take controll of the oil plants. And we know now that the premisses of going into that war was a huge lie #weaponsofmassdestruction #agenda
1925 2018-04-18 20:21:35 Iraq was fought over weapons of mass destruction not oil.i had family that fought both gulf wars.
1926 2018-04-18 20:21:30 I was thinking the same thing yesterday. Their whole narrative has switched on a dime. We don't need Alberta oil but we need Alberta oil :/
1927 2018-04-18 20:21:25 1) Wouldn't a tribal be using primitive farming techniques and virtually be wasting the potential of that piece of land? 2) What if the tribals are living on a land with massive oil/mineral deposits that can do much greater good?
1928 2018-04-18 20:21:23 Stock indexes barely moved but a lot happened under the surface. 
Surge in oil drives energy stocks. Anadarko $APC +3.6%, $CVX +2.0%, $XOM +1.2%

Despite oil, transport stocks rally. United $UAL +4.8%, American $AAL +4.4%, $FDX +1.4%

Many industrials gain. $CAT +1.7%, $BA +1.3%

1930 2018-04-18 20:21:20 Can we use Oil of Olay? 
1931 2018-04-18 20:21:18 I'll take that bet chump.  

Rafael Edward Cruz has been exposed as a fraud while "running for president".  Texans are sick of that grandstanding, snake oil salesman that doesn't represent his constituents.
1932 2018-04-18 20:21:16 Agree that fundamentals are strong.  Oil price is a beast of it's own though.  Not sure anyone knows what price is needed to incentivize producers to provide enough supply to match demand.  Time will tell.
1933 2018-04-18 20:21:11 Truly the Bible is correct.. Oil flow from the head then downwards... If your head is not correct all the other part can be correct.

1935 2018-04-18 20:21:01 Hot paprika, little bit of olive oil and tablespoon of lamb and cumin fried. Oh and roasted pine kernels.
1936 2018-04-18 20:20:41 If you think we compete with the oil wealth at Man City then my friend it is you who is taking bollocks. And no I’m not saying we shouldn’t be doing better than we are. But we are light years behind their wealth.  And it will only get worse
1937 2018-04-18 20:20:11 Oh oh j’aurai bien aimé  oh je vais l’épouser et lui donner des pommes pour qu’il reste 
1938 2018-04-18 20:20:10 So are you saying that it's not oil money?
1939 2018-04-18 20:20:08 Coconut oil = ALL ROUND LIFE SAVER
1940 2018-04-18 20:20:06 I’m so sorry. It’s hellish. I don’t know if it’s legal where you live, but here in OR I have access to high grade CBD oil and it really helps with my symptoms w/o the side effects common with nerve blockers. You can get the oil with no thc, so there’s no head-change.
1941 2018-04-18 20:20:03 No but change your oil
1942 2018-04-18 20:20:01 Coming from a man who does not have an SSCE certificate.

A man who waited around for almost thirty years just to lay his hands on oil money (again).

During the 30 years, he did nothing, as he simply lived off money from oil.
1943 2018-04-18 20:19:47 Your statement was that #EnergyEast was cancelled based on collapsing oil prices. This applies to Energy East & TMX. Only difference between reviews is that upstream & downstream ghg analysis was applied to #EnergyEast. TransCanada stated regulatory changes caused cancellation.
1944 2018-04-18 20:19:36 I strongly disagree. So many of the wars you have started has been on false premisses #irak And so many of your wars has been about controlling things like oil. I talked to a couple of soldiers from the US, that was sent to Irak after Afghanistan.
1945 2018-04-18 20:19:35 A swollen tongue, a plastic gun
Red burn from an orange sun
These oil rigs will crack and run
These palm trees will be chopped to a stump
1946 2018-04-18 20:19:29 I just paid 12 dollars for a DELUXE car wash, then I came to Toyota to get my oil change, AND THEYRE GONNA WASH THAT HOE 4 FREEEEE WTFFFFF
1947 2018-04-18 20:19:16 That's how I have things priced/correlated to inventory levels.  Seems reasonable considering we are about to enter an extended period lower and lower and lower oil and product inventory. something like the next 2 to 3 years. There will be plenty of room for $140-$160 by Dec-2019

1951 2018-04-18 20:19:06 No, get an oil change

1955 2018-04-18 20:18:45 Debating taking a plunge into working on my own vehicle soon. First proposed change: serpentine belt. Also an oil change.
1956 2018-04-18 20:18:43 Fair enough but can you as an organisation stop logging which decimates habitat, or can you prevent land clearance for palm oil production?

1961 2018-04-18 20:18:13 Oh, Kai, let me change your life:

 - olive oil & salt 
 - roast at 400 for about an hour

You'll never slander them again.
1962 2018-04-18 20:18:01 that too with the assistance of much lower oil prices.
1963 2018-04-18 20:17:42 It's so cute the way people want to phase out the industry but keep the oil for their cars.
1964 2018-04-18 20:17:32 tumharay mulk ka area kitna he? jitna tumhara mulk he us se 3 guna bada Al jeria ka sehra he. na Oil he na Gas he. tum mar Qu nhi jaatay?

1966 2018-04-18 20:17:26 He brought ultra religious right. He listened to hawks like Bolton..he was run by Cheney. Oil..weapons of mass..lies. NRA..used Terrorism to sell assault weapons to people afraid of being killed at malls..movies..schools..
1967 2018-04-18 20:17:21 Don’t boil them or cook them with butter.  Cook in oven or fry with oil so  they’re crispy
1968 2018-04-18 20:17:13 Beautiful.. If trump gets his way with more oil rigs in our ocean, this will continue to cause problems for our wildlife both in the air and sea.
1969 2018-04-18 20:17:09 Thanks! And will give it my best! Funny thing is: many people in those organisations know it too but it's not easy to make an oil tanker chance course.

1972 2018-04-18 20:16:33 Getting a oil change and a car wash
1973 2018-04-18 20:16:28 Yeah. He was putting some kind of oil and stuff on it flipping it and all. I don’t think in my entire life I’ve ever heard of a grilled salad
1974 2018-04-18 20:16:21 Fiiiiight! Left vs riiiight! Get him oil!!! 
1975 2018-04-18 20:16:19 Apparently Chiarelli is evaluating the Oil Kings *players* and doing exit interviews for them.
1976 2018-04-18 20:16:17 We are almost there. By 2025 we will be oil independent.
1977 2018-04-18 20:16:15 jamille checked my oil two weeks ago & gave me the money to get a oil change im just now about to go 
1978 2018-04-18 20:16:14 It's not the oil they're after it's the need to build an Oil Pipeline across Europe and through Syria, Both Russia & USA are building different pipelines the fight is for the shortest route via territory gain.
1979 2018-04-18 20:16:10 Oil pulling is the best...
1980 2018-04-18 20:16:09 We don’t have any tanning oil at home so I used olive oil and my mom is so pissed at me 
1981 2018-04-18 20:16:06 So I'm getting my oil changed and they asked me year make and model and without thinking I said "2008 Chevy Silverado" HAAAAA I wish
1982 2018-04-18 20:15:56 That Chiarelli is interviewing the Oil Kings *players* and doing an assessment of them.

1986 2018-04-18 20:15:24 Because the Republicans start wars to line the pockets of their buddies in the war machine. They don't care about the young lives lost, it's always about money and oil.
1987 2018-04-18 20:15:21 Yeah but oil is worse than drugs...or something...I guess.
1988 2018-04-18 20:15:19 Does Schmeer want an exact date or just roughly because shutting down our oil rigs is, you know, kind of involved, cough, since there are major companies there *under contract* with other *globally owned* companies with *shareholders etc.etc I guess he thinks you flip a switch??
1989 2018-04-18 20:15:06 It's worrisome that a columnist describes avoiding a Big Oil swindle like TMX as "economic suicide", when using that money to transition toward renewable energy sources and technologies are an actual investment that can be used as far into the future as we can imagine.
#StopKM
1990 2018-04-18 20:14:51 While you were distracted by Trump's tweets, Mitch McConnell allowed oil drilling in Chuck Schumer.
1991 2018-04-18 20:14:45 This is another level of stupidity like what oil money ? The same oil we spent hours trying to buy with our hard earn money during scarcity or what ? If he say lazy and illiterate maybe he’s talking about his tribe
1992 2018-04-18 20:14:42 @C_Nishtwin I think it might not come out great cuz the brownie batter with water might not bake right. You could ask proper brownie batter with eggs and oil and it would probably be fine, but don’t pre bake a crust
1993 2018-04-18 20:14:41 defending "big pharma" would be a doomed political prospect, i couldnt even see conservatives getting behind that. They are as derided, if not more than, the oil industry
1994 2018-04-18 20:14:17 Then a president that says all youths r lazy and depend on oil money..tomorrow, we ask why embassies and airport officials treat us like trash..useless oaf

2025 2018-04-18 20:10:51 Rebecca the point is it has zero affect on supply, as you have already acknowledged. We are not going to run out of oil, anymore than the Stone Age ended because they ran out of rocks. It is a demand issue & we can curb that via the ETS in which the market sets the price

2044 2018-04-18 20:09:05 One nation at a time are leaving the dollar as the United States loses world position. Oil is no longer only denominated in dollars. Iran denominates in Yuan or Euro. Americans just party on while their house burns. So focused on the Absurd Trump Soap Opera diverting attention.
2045 2018-04-18 20:09:03 Since metals follow oil (not money supply), I'd say until oil goes up pm's won't.  Pretty damn simple.

2059 2018-04-18 20:07:54 Think I’ll be done with FoI for anything but news now. It has turned into HF Oil with the excuses being made for a shitty team. Blind homerism presented as mathematical analysis.
2060 2018-04-18 20:07:50 There were lots of welfare cases there during the so called good times, I knew a lot of people who lived in abject poverty then too because they were never part of the oil industry.
2061 2018-04-18 20:07:43 Physical commodity traders like BP, Vitol, Trafigura have armies of staff working to track and transfer ownership of cargoes of oil, corn etc.  Tracking ownership in a smart contract would save these firms vast sums of money.  I suppose they will opt for enterprise blockchain.
2062 2018-04-18 20:07:39 Stream is very divided over Oil direction. Love it or hate it for the most part.
2063 2018-04-18 20:07:18 Who looks at the fundamentals.  Saudis want $80+ oil for their IPO and they will somehow get there.  Rest is all gimmicks played out for oil trading audience.

2068 2018-04-18 20:06:41 Far better than the massive plastic dumps now spreading all over our oceans !

Re-use the petroleum to make new plastic bottles, far better than drilling for more oil.

The future could become anything now that far less petrol might be needed for many things eg electric cars.

2071 2018-04-18 20:06:29 Silver up over 40 cents per ounce and oil up over 2 dollars per barrel, yet gold only managed to gain 1 dollar per ounce.  I wonder how much longer the sellers will be able to keep the gold price in check?  It looks like the $1,350 battle line will be increasingly hard to defend!

2078 2018-04-18 20:05:39 Tim, if you like garlic, try this recipe: sm avocado, garlic cloves to taste, fresh chopped mint, squeeze of fresh lemon, 1/4 cup white vinegar, 1/8 cup olive oil, salt, pepper. Mix in blender until well blended. Taste test add flavorings as needed. Use on salads, chicken, fish.
2079 2018-04-18 20:05:38 It's really crazy to me that someone with a masters degree will make like 40k but if you bust your ass enough you can make that or more in the oil field

2087 2018-04-18 20:05:11 Alberta is a bully because they are forcing their will on BC and on BC's critically sensitive eco-system for the sole purpose of increasing production and selling oil to Asia.
2088 2018-04-18 20:05:11 Aye man after that curry won some mvps and rings, maybe kp need some of that oil
2089 2018-04-18 20:05:07 Don’t you love it when things don’t turn out? If it’s raw, sauté with some olive oil and a few spices and make cauliflower rice. Or use it to make a pizza crust.  Or toss it in the snow!
2090 2018-04-18 20:04:54 No because they refuse to answer the phone and I need a oil change
2091 2018-04-18 20:04:46 What facts does he need to find out in Iraq, to see if they have more oil than Scotland?? Don't need to waste tax payers money for that!

2094 2018-04-18 20:04:35 They realize that the oil will be shipped one way or another, better by pipeline than by rail. Railways go through countless cities and towns, pipelines for the most part go around them. Much safer to ship via pipeline verses rail.
2095 2018-04-18 20:04:32 Getting my oil changed watching divorce court ! Lol the judge is super bad tho !! 
2096 2018-04-18 20:04:31 @AndrewScheer I don't understand why the Oil Sands can't be refined where it is? Sending oil to the US to be refined and then paying to buy it from them seems more than ridiculous!  Canadians first!  Refine in Canada for  Canadians' use first.
2097 2018-04-18 20:04:26 is getting a fucking oil cartridge so hard to get?
2098 2018-04-18 20:04:25 doesn't help as the currency devaluing all the time. Are oil prices on the dollar?

2100 2018-04-18 20:03:51 Example: Hudson River PCBs
Example: Oil spill, 1970s in Bemidji, MN - plume still in aquifer despite all remediation efforts, poisoned drinkin* water sources
Example: Exxon Valdez, environment still puking up crude, DNA damage in ecosystem
2101 2018-04-18 20:03:49 By it's nature, oil industry is cyclical. Don't know about you guys, but I'm hoping for a gradual incline supported by financials rather than overextending to extremes. Old habits are hard to kick though.
2102 2018-04-18 20:03:21 I remember when I used Afro sheen as tanning oil and that shittt worked

2106 2018-04-18 20:02:49 Want your car to run forever? Tip #1: Check and change the oil. No single step will help an engine last more than regular oil and filter changes will. Conversely, nothing will destroy an engine faster than neglecting oil-level checks or fresh-oil changes. #WednesdayWisdom
2107 2018-04-18 20:02:43 Our oil is clean and ethical.  You are delusional

2111 2018-04-18 20:02:22 @CNBC_Awaaz Read somewhere,every $10/bbl increase in oil prices will increase CPI by 60-70 basis points .In order to bring fuel prices down various taxes will have to be axed . This will lead depreciation in tax collections which could take heavy toll on Fiscal deficit.
2112 2018-04-18 20:02:11 Because unconventional Uk on shore extraction of gas and oil is being pushed through by back door by Tory govt. in the NPPF ( out for consultation now). For uk that means fracking/acidization under our homes, the countryside poc marked with a well every 3 miles aka Pennsylvania

2138 2018-04-18 19:59:00 Elon is the man and still some oil and combustion autos' lobbies are trying to hinder him. However this is the first time a true entrepreneur is changing the world we live in.
2139 2018-04-18 19:58:49 I think olive oil is the one that should be consumed raw. Coconut oil doesn’t lose its properties when heated.
2140 2018-04-18 19:58:43 British interests in the region during and after the war  were oil based, there were oil pipelines from Iraq which ended at Haifa , from where it was processed and then exported.

It was also a land corridor connecting Egypt to Jordan and Iraq.
2141 2018-04-18 19:58:31 I loveeeee slathering myself in coconut oil. dat shit feels nice
2142 2018-04-18 19:58:25 AHAHA i was talking to someone about oregano oil and then it clicked that it was my name 
2143 2018-04-18 19:58:19 Is it really a "pivot towards mysticism" when we're talking about the clown who thinks that his sperm is some kind of magical mind controlling "super serum" and that he's completely immune from all STIs because he uses tea tree oil for lube? @ChrisWarcraft
2144 2018-04-18 19:58:15 I wish I was Canadian and my only political problem was a oil pipeline
2145 2018-04-18 19:58:00 Hate to say it, but it's going to take more than oil price to get most E&P names back to highs.  Proof is in the earnings.  And it may take more than one quarter.  Anything less is temporary.
2146 2018-04-18 19:57:53 Few things to note. Brown put VAT st 15%. Coalition increased back to back to 20%. Oil prices hit very low (40$ range) in 2009 to 10. crept back to above 100$ in 2011. And then there was QE that had an impact on £. Bottom line is inflation simply was not due to wage increases
2147 2018-04-18 19:57:47 Perhaps it will stop them burning oil instead #messy
2148 2018-04-18 19:57:40 Just needs oil to fade to take PMI data down with it and 10's will fall lower to tag 2's
2149 2018-04-18 19:57:37 Amid little major news, US equities nudged higher, the S&P500 up 0.3%. Oil prices rose 3% to a three-year high following inventory news. Bond yields rose, while currencies were again muted.
2150 2018-04-18 19:57:33 The reason people from the oil rich prairies flock to our beautiful GREEN province is clear....and those of us who live here in beautiful BC wish to keep it green and ecologically sound . Don’t often hear Alberta or Sask touting how much THEY’RE doing ecologically....
2151 2018-04-18 19:57:30 Hmmm deeper than an Arctic oil well.

2159 2018-04-18 19:56:31 I don't understand not believing in skin types. Like left to its own devices, my skin is an oil slick but my mom's is super dry, is that not an example of different types? As for toner, I believe in "fresheners" which we all know is toner in disguise.
2160 2018-04-18 19:56:30 $USO oil is priced in USD which tells me usd went up the market crash won't happen till trump is out he won't bail out banks
2161 2018-04-18 19:56:18 I heard about Swanee Hunt being one of the people behind this. She's part of the Big Oil dynasty. Isn't this just the big corporations taking control over everyone?

2165 2018-04-18 19:55:45 @GovernorVA is medical marijuana oil legal for people who have health problem not epilepsy THC-A?
2166 2018-04-18 19:55:44 I’m in the middle of prepping for FET now. Estrace tabs three times a day and a patch. Also the progesterone in oil injections. But my insurance did cover most of those. $63 for everything including delivery after insurance.
2167 2018-04-18 19:55:44 The same way it was irrational to have oil in the 30's, so shall it be when oil is triple digits again. #Comex doesn't create a fair price, it usually takes a price from one extreme to the other. #Commodities very well known for their boom and bust cycles. #OOTT

2169 2018-04-18 19:55:06 You try and try and try and try to tell people, but they go to the polls and vote against their own interest because they believe a snake oil salesman. Now, they find themselves out of work. Making America great again had nothing to do with individuals. Can you hear me now?

2179 2018-04-18 19:53:57 ...If you’re not a part of a very tiny % of Nigeria, the revenue from oil would never trickle down to you. Anyone waiting to benefit from this needs wake up now!
2180 2018-04-18 19:53:52 The only time I have ever enjoyed an olive was in a well-preserved medieval village after climbing castle ruins in Provence. It was like black...sun-dried and preserved in oil or something? 
DIVINE.
Otherwise- no. They're disgusting.

Good luck with your decision love!

2189 2018-04-18 19:52:36 me and sam thought it was a good idea to put oil on 
2190 2018-04-18 19:52:34 Fish oil is the main ingredient.
2191 2018-04-18 19:52:34 If we pause oil sands expansion, as we must to deal with climate change, there is no need for this pipeline. We currently have a surplus of pipeline capacity, which is why TransCanada cancelled energy East and opted to go ahead with KXL. They couldn't fill both pipes.
2192 2018-04-18 19:52:30 Same thing happens to me if I go longer than a day. Especially my scalp. Build up of oil??
2193 2018-04-18 19:52:29 I got this job moving water for the oil field and I’m fucking depressed that I have to shave my beard

2202 2018-04-18 19:52:00 Having oil & gas operations off the west coast of BC or in the Arctic is dangerous as we are in an active earthquake zone in BC & quakes are active in the Arctic, where damage due to a spill or blow out at a rig are too high & the damage worse then in southern Canada.

2205 2018-04-18 19:51:49 An economy is like an oil tanker- can't be turned around in s short time. It was already headed in that direction courtesy of your previous POTUS. #45 is just reaping the benefit of the bow wave
2206 2018-04-18 19:51:38 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
2207 2018-04-18 19:51:37 “More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education for free.”

Sir @MBuhari, You lied!

2210 2018-04-18 19:51:18 Since I’m being a bitch... I also hated her “oil slick” red lipgloss. It’s too much for morning & all of her paleness. I believe she also wore it yesterday. Did you like it? Or does that just show my age?
2211 2018-04-18 19:51:14 fuck around and sell my oil spill ticket if yall moving like this

2214 2018-04-18 19:50:50 It has nothing to do with status quo, this is expanding operations n the oil patch to produce more, send more down the pipeline and to sell that more to Asia. Asia should buy oil from someone a lot closer so it doesn't have to be shipped around the planet at tremendous risk!
2215 2018-04-18 19:50:48 Fascinated by her female form
The artist brush attempts
Lines finding canvas
Barron landscape changed
As her oil representation
takes shape
No matter how precise
Articulate or concise
The artist failed to portray
For her fire spirit on the threads
Would not stay #poetry
2216 2018-04-18 19:50:44 You obviously don't understand the difference between bitumen and oil. Bitumen can be transported as a solid. In the event of a derailment it sits on the ground and does not combust because it is not volatile.
2217 2018-04-18 19:50:32 Frequently touted 'healthy options' of things like peanut butter etc use palm oil!

2223 2018-04-18 19:50:01 My mates in Europe without jobs still feed 4rm monies paid to them by govt 4m oil proceeds, some hold more than one job created by their govt 4rm oil wealth. What hav u done with our oil wealth, Buhari? Oh you've been using it 2 blame PDP. GOD JUDGE U, BUHARI
2224 2018-04-18 19:49:34 Oil ? National security? We dont have anywhere to process it and turn it into fuel do we ?
2225 2018-04-18 19:49:31 Avocados are love ... if you really know how to eat them ......
Try this ... take fresh avocado ... mash it, add little olive oil, little lemon squeeze, cilantro, fine chopped onion, parsley, and than top it with cracked black pepper and himalayan pink salt

2229 2018-04-18 19:49:08 All that is being said is this, like it or not   #oil is not going away, if it does not get to #bc by #pipeline then it goes by #truck or #rail can you say #lacmegantictraindisaster how ever it gets there,the #oil goes to #britishcolumbia #vancouver  lesser of 2 evils.
2230 2018-04-18 19:49:04 You use way less oil for frying. I'll tell you that

2232 2018-04-18 19:48:31 Wow, what is happening with oil?!
2233 2018-04-18 19:48:28 I know I am not smart enough (no need to agree thank you) but I don't get why higher oil is good or at least irrelevant for trannies....
2234 2018-04-18 19:48:14 Se a Petrobras continuasse subsidiando pesado os preços de gasolina e diesel no MI e fazendo prejuízos bilionários, não ia ter Oil a usd70 que ia fazer ela subir. Talvez parte do que o Gabriel se refira seja isso!
2235 2018-04-18 19:48:14 I really want to start oil painting...

One day I want to have my own art studio. Where I can sit and sip on a cup of tea surrounded by art supplies and flowers.
2236 2018-04-18 19:47:56 omg - he's claiming that energy companies didn't get tax breaks?

isn't that ALL Harper did - give $$$ to oil companies?
2237 2018-04-18 19:47:56 People already make choices:
To buy local (= within 100km;  and pay a slightly higher price).
To use public transit (like SkyTrain) over owning a vehicle.

Electric vehicles will become mainstream as people demand change.

Renewables is our future - not oil.
2238 2018-04-18 19:47:54 oil 40 ticks above settle
2239 2018-04-18 19:47:44 Add inherent goodness to all the concerned people's issue's, join hands in completing projects once started-finish them. Pipe-line is best idea for moving oil to destinations.This pipe-line is reminding me a lot of Trump!This is most likely last time as a Nation-we're so divided.
2240 2018-04-18 19:47:43 Com essa explosão do Oil desde 2016, se a minha avó fosse presidente da empresa a ação teria valorizado. Brasil é um fazendão, e o preço das coisas que esta fazenda fabrica estão subindo.
2241 2018-04-18 19:47:33 Well .. was first time I’d been exposed to a Mediterranean diet of oil based food ... went to impt meeting ... crossed my legs and the contents of lunch poured down my right leg ....

2245 2018-04-18 19:47:21 from stating the problems & despite the fact that " Nigeria is an Oil Producing Nation "? What has been the fate of those that brought us
2246 2018-04-18 19:47:13 It’s one thing if we have no oil. We have oil let’s use it until we have an alternative. It takes oil and coal to fuel research.

2253 2018-04-18 19:45:58 Bit of plank aren’t you Ben? what makes you assume ‘I am ok with selling them arms? The arms will get through as long as there  is oil money to buy them.

2263 2018-04-18 19:45:12 What is the world class plan to clean up an oil spill? From what I read 10% clean up qualifies as world class for you. What happens with the 90% of coast that will be destroyed in the event of an earthquake or human error. How does such a disaster help our economy?
2264 2018-04-18 19:45:12 Way more tweets about curve flattening than about oil's continued run.

2279 2018-04-18 19:43:43 In Democratic debate for gov @GwenGraham responds to @AndrewGillum re Keystone pipeline vote: Keystone was not about extracting oil out of the ground. It was about how you were going to transport that oil. ... The reality is transporting by pipeline is the least carbon emission.

Happy spring everyone!
2296 2018-04-18 19:42:19 Greasy hair after only one day? Add some baby powder to your scalp to dry up some of the oil. Make sure to brush it through really well and it should get you and your hair through another day without damaging suds.
2297 2018-04-18 19:42:11 This is a disgraceful Tweet. Absolutely no thought for the environmental impact of that fucker drowning. The resultant oil slick would kill fish and birds in record numbers.

2311 2018-04-18 19:40:42 Agreed but regardless prices going higher. In the 1970's we had oil embargo. And, mining investment is down sharply over past 3 years which creates supply issues whenever there is externalities not foreseen.

2330 2018-04-18 19:37:53 I agree but, it would taste better without PALM OIL. And wildlife/rainforests would be safer

2355 2018-04-18 19:35:56 You're the nieve one. We only need the pipeline if we expand the oil sands by a lot. If we expand the oil sands by that much we will increase our GHG emissions, not reduce them.
2356 2018-04-18 19:35:33 Wait a couple of years, electricity will cost more than oil. If everyone has changed theirs conventional cars on electric one, so,  eventually we would end up with building more nuclear stations and it’s not cheap.

2363 2018-04-18 19:35:03 Online surveys mean almost nothing — biased sampling. Opposition to the pipeline and fear of increased oil spill accidents and worry about the downstream pollution is massive, particularly in the lower mainland.

2365 2018-04-18 19:35:01 How about proof that in over 1/2 a century there have been no oil tanker spills in the Port of Vancouver.  Even with 300+ships per year & importantly a large increase in regulations that the company must adhere to, including higher standards for the existing shipments.

2373 2018-04-18 19:34:16 My obsession with cars and now ultimately career was down to my primary teacher at Croft St. He got a Jensen Interceptor in the oil crisis in the 70s and parked outside the classroom in the playground. I’m sure he would love a day with me if he were around now.

2381 2018-04-18 19:33:24 Aye after we carved things up we stirred up a hornet's nest for oil.
2382 2018-04-18 19:33:09 @IcelandFoods 14 hours?? That’s appalling.  Makes a mockery of everything else you’re promoting around packaging waste and palm oil 
2383 2018-04-18 19:33:01 Do you realize oil oozes from the ground all over the world....into our oceans where fish eat it and plant-life absorb it and actually thrive. It’s not a man made substance....back to standing rock. What is your answer to the animal abuse? My pets are my life...I keep them safe
2384 2018-04-18 19:32:48 Sure looks like we could roll here. All it would take is a pull from oil and we slip back down.

2387 2018-04-18 19:32:44 Bottom line is nothing good is coming from oil and gas except for their gain and the gain of people who have had some type of old and gas work done on their property (good for those people, I'm truly happy for you). But more damage has been done to this county more then anything.

2393 2018-04-18 19:31:47 "This is incredible, following the publishing of our groundbreaking report on deforestation in Borneo's peat forests, more than 130,000 people have already demanded PepsiCo stop greenwashing its palm oil policy and cut deforestation from its supply chain." @SumOfUs
2394 2018-04-18 19:31:45 Even those who support the expansion of the oil sands should be concerned about the influence of a foreign corporation on our domestic policy. This is not a partisan issue, this is a democratic crisis.

Even IF the climate was proven to be 100% unchangingly static, how dare we still want renewable fuel. How dare we want to stop all the wars that happen because of oil, and have cheaper ways to run our cars.
2415 2018-04-18 19:29:51 Evaluate case by case:  If you can throw it in the wash, wash it.  If you can't, hit it with 409, Fantastik, or Murphy's Oil (for wood, obviously).  If that's too much work, chuck it.

2431 2018-04-18 19:28:07 He’s not going to shut it down. He’s just going to make it seem like the oil sands are where capital goes to die. Ie no pipelines, more taxes, etc. Eventually they’ll collapse on “their own” and he can say he had nothing to do with it.

2442 2018-04-18 19:27:16 What do Tories do "for the benefits of Scots" Jimmy? Bombing Syria, the rape clause, wasting the oil money, trialing the poll tax, keeping nuclear weapons here and Murdo Fraser are not plus points. By the way, it's benefit not benefits. No gold star on your report card today. 
2443 2018-04-18 19:27:08 Oil and gas traffic is outrageous especially when a commute to school, work, or even home takes  double sometimes triple the normal time. Not to mention the deaths that have been caused by well traffic.
2444 2018-04-18 19:27:03 Seadrill to seek closer ties with Schlumberger, oil service firms
2445 2018-04-18 19:27:02 "Until now, Asian refiners have mostly purchased U.S. oil that’s sold to them on a delivered basis by traders, who would source the cargoes, load them onto smaller vessels & arrange 4 out-at-sea transfers to supertankers that can’t enter shallow berths of most American terminals"
2446 2018-04-18 19:27:01 I understand global warming and I  hope for more alternative fuels. But this oil is for export. The problem isn't Canada's addition, it's everyone else's.
2447 2018-04-18 19:26:38 Tag yourself im me not realizing I have lavender oil and getting it on my hands and having an allergic reaction!!!!
2448 2018-04-18 19:26:16 I thought he liked oil now. I can’t keep up.
2449 2018-04-18 19:26:15 @PepsiCo must close its policy loophole for JV partners & require all palm oil produced and purchased by @Indofood & Salim Group to meet PepsiCo's policy. Relying on RSPO can't ensure #palmoil free of deforestation, peat destruction and exploitation.
2450 2018-04-18 19:26:06 I wish I could go to get my oil changed without experiencing the most uncomfortable social interaction.
2451 2018-04-18 19:26:04 I dunno about in the UK but every time I've had Five Guys the meat has no flavor so the burger just tastes like the peanut oil they cook it in.

2458 2018-04-18 19:25:27 Just a drizzle of oil and sometimes a bit of garlic or a pinch of salt

2462 2018-04-18 19:25:10 Why is oil up? So what if there was a oil draw down! We are producing more oil than ever before!  We are exporting more than ever! Why is oil u so much, It's called High Frequency Trading and big bank leveraging!
2463 2018-04-18 19:25:09 I keep lagging on this deep condition and hot oil treatment
2464 2018-04-18 19:25:08 It’s unremarkable tbh. I use sunflower oil from @EdensGardenOils (where I get all my essential oils) and it works way better.
2465 2018-04-18 19:25:08 Chicken thighs slowly cooked at room temperature over 11 hours improves the taste though doesn't it?  but @MalcolmCWalker & @IcelandRichard too busy virtue signalling about palm oil to be bothered about such trivialities as exposing their customers to food poisoning
2466 2018-04-18 19:24:59 The man say
Cos naija is a rich oil nation,we don't wanna work but sit n expect free thing
2467 2018-04-18 19:24:54 @sinKEVitch  I know this sounds stupid but seriously try 2 drops of oregano oil--instant symptomatic relief, clear your head right up. chase it with a glass of water because it burns though
2468 2018-04-18 19:24:47 They are lazy and want free oil money by defending and debunking and insulting and excusing their Bosses incompetence.
2469 2018-04-18 19:24:45 “More than 60% of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education for free.”
 - Pmb How true is 
This? @FemAdesina
2470 2018-04-18 19:24:44 Yes! Love everything by @greenandbalmy - Aphrodite is my current face oil and the bath potion is a go to when I'm feeling achy. It's all fab 
2471 2018-04-18 19:24:43 Thanks for that! We got to do the burning oil one where the foam has to slide down the back wall and form a layer over the pan.  Quite tricky. We don't even have fryers in the office, but hey ho.

2473 2018-04-18 19:24:37 Yuck! I had a similar problem - apparently using tea tree oil can help to kill off the mould but I haven’t tried it yet. If you wipe the mould off it just comes back!

2482 2018-04-18 19:23:51 No, actually we’re taking the threats to our children’s future seriously. We use by far more oil then most others in the world and need to account for this. We are wasteful period. Our addiction to oil is going to cost all of us if we don’t start embracing alternatives.
2483 2018-04-18 19:23:49 Gas price on the rise!  Oil up again today!  So much for our tax cuts as there's going right into our gas tanks and out our tailpipes!  Meanwhile CEO's are making big bucks!
2484 2018-04-18 19:23:41 If you take this seriously, @PepsiCo must set a clear deadline & implementation plan for independently verified ‘No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation’ supply chains & business partners. You must go beyond RSPO oil & ensure that all products are Conflict Palm Oil free.

2489 2018-04-18 19:23:21 Imam Trudeau wants to ensure his Saudi oil friends can keep pumping away without having to worry about pesky western oil. Who wants to be self sufficient anyways?

2491 2018-04-18 19:23:17 they decided to set all of these movies on oil rigs instead at least according to my experiences
2492 2018-04-18 19:23:16 @jimcarr_wpg you owe all Of Alberta an apology after insulting us in Question Period. Our gas and oil industry is a leader in innovation.
2493 2018-04-18 19:23:15 Hahahahaahahahaha, not that type man, If Buhari should rule Nigeria more than may29 2019, the only tin we'll have ll be oil, the type used in frying akara
2494 2018-04-18 19:23:07 What's good for an ear infection I'm on antibiotics and using olive oil drops but the pain is ridiculous and I still can't hear properly after 48 hrs

2496 2018-04-18 19:22:52 Gill, here is our new list. I need you to deliver this today please. Is that possible?

4 Challas
1 dozen eggs
1 bottle oil
Salt
Pepper
K...
2497 2018-04-18 19:22:51 guess widening of CA deficit (and structural need to import oil/ gas which makes closing it hard) is the new factor that could trigger difficulties beyond the observed weakening of the TRY
2498 2018-04-18 19:22:49 I will take the unders on that. The EROI of oil will make certain of that.
2499 2018-04-18 19:22:47 WHICH OTHER ARMY RUNS AN ECONOMIC BUSINESS EMPIRE OTHER THAN PAK ARMY? Army makes corn flakes, cement, ghee, shoes, oil guard and operates in over a dozen business like insurance, banks, real estate. they are so inefficient at the job we pay them to do – protect and defend us.
2500 2018-04-18 19:22:42 Interesting MS piece on oil today; implies Brent/WTI higher and explains recent strength in WCS/WTI.
2501 2018-04-18 19:22:39 Also renewable energy is the largest and fastest growing energy sector in America.  It employs more ppl than gas oil and fracking combined.  Our government might have reversed course but the ppl have spoken with their wallets and we want renewable.  Trump is just a greedy man
2502 2018-04-18 19:22:35 Oil and Gas may have brought jobs to the county but I still mainly see workers from out of state. When pipelines are put through people's backyards some people who live on the property do not even have a say in it because they do not own the mineral rights to the land.
2503 2018-04-18 19:22:21 Thinking abour use Khorne Red + Nuln Oil + Wazdakka Red + Cadian Fleshtone for a red Stormcast armour (like the Flesh Tearers armour on the citadel paint app) 
2504 2018-04-18 19:22:17 Rice bran oil is sold to humans because it has too bad an effect on animals. They're fed the defatted rice bran left over from white rice production. 
2505 2018-04-18 19:22:04 Or brine it in water,olive oil,parsley n vinegar.the vinegar enzymes will tenderize the fillet, and the rest what @planetpandamo said

2506 2018-04-18 19:22:02 This is a very clever and beneficial suggestion. Kurdish Region sells oil to other countries and gets ripped off, Turkey buys oil from Russia at higher price, they need each other.

2511 2018-04-18 19:21:36 Although I consider ‘oil’ a pretty good pasta sauce
2512 2018-04-18 19:21:27 Swallowing this stuff is akin to Cod Liver oil from years past.  Only difference is cod liver oil was supposed to be good for you....
2513 2018-04-18 19:21:25 Oh for some reason Moe has decided to drag Sask into it by wanting to restrict oil to BC and is willing to go to court. Even though our oil wouldn't be going through Kinder Morgan... I'm not sure if that's dumb squared or dumb cubed.
2514 2018-04-18 19:21:20 How? This has never happened to me. I’ve been getting oil changes for 9 years.

2519 2018-04-18 19:20:33 As I said, oil is a precious resource that we will need for time to come. The ways in which we use it is unsustainable. I take seriously the threats to my children’s future and prefer to make sacrifices if necessary to preserve this place for future generations.

2525 2018-04-18 19:20:01 Depends on how you evaluate "best way". Dabbing might produce the best results, but oil vapes are much more convenient and you look less crackhead-esk. No need to carry a torch, smoking device and dabbing equipment. Vapes fit in your pocket.

2535 2018-04-18 19:19:12 They won't last? Planning on driving them out? How very facist of you! They grow up so fast.

Without oil you are nothing. I look forward to the day Alberta returns to being the poorest, most irrelevant province in the country. Sending you our right wingers will help that.

2539 2018-04-18 19:18:56 Also. With Canada, Alberta and BC being so antagonistic towards oil, the industry has lost faith in this country for oil/fuel development. The world will move on without our oil. It will take years to recover from this pipeline debacle

2548 2018-04-18 19:17:43 I think the hate from Carr is actually for the idiot Trudeau putting him in the awkward positions, he’s smart enough to know that oil exports are in Canada’s interests but he has to deal with idiot Trudeau who knows zero about economics
2549 2018-04-18 19:17:43 grapeseed oil  is sooooo underrated.

2556 2018-04-18 19:16:41 The dark side has the power to twist Notleys and Trudeaus until they resemble Kenneys and Harpers who's own extreme oil industry support caused such push back that the industry they fought for had to ask "with friends like these...."

2566 2018-04-18 19:15:19 We held a partnership in the area, voted against selling when an offer was made prior to the shale oil boom, but a majority of partners voted to sell.  Bad timing.  It would have been worth much more if they had held out.

2575 2018-04-18 19:14:06 Has anyone seriously considering leaving oil and gas in the ground.

Would anyone leave $50,000 dollars buried in your backyard
2576 2018-04-18 19:13:57 Ahhh gotcha... 
Yes, the flavor is what’s trying to be achieved. I just love coco milk so much, wasn’t sure if it was possible.
The oil alt sounds lovely, so thank you for the advice!
2577 2018-04-18 19:13:49 Character is the oil, you are the lamp.
2578 2018-04-18 19:13:45 Oh yes of course, sorry I didn’t think before replying. It’s because they’re ‘attracted’ to the oil and/or detergents which is what the companies flogging it say. It’s a bit out of context, and no proof it’s better than water as far as I know.

2585 2018-04-18 19:12:56 Two things high oil prices will do.

1. Encourage frackers to produces more oil and gas.
2. Encourage development of electric vehicles.

(1) will happen in US and (2) is very important for China.

Neither is good for Nigeria in the medium or long term.

2620 2018-04-18 19:09:15 Money. Oil. Money. Power. Money. Glory. Money. He sees himself as a Master of the Universe. Wants adoration, crowds, parades for him. Always brags about his deal making ability, his good genes, his success, wealth, etc. This is who he is.  A wannabe strongman. Like Putin

2624 2018-04-18 19:08:48 And then he took me in his arms and ever so gently brushed back my oil slicked hair and that's when I thought for sure I would faint.  He then leaned in close for the long awaited kiss and.............sorry, the rest is x rated.

2635 2018-04-18 19:08:18 I want real fur. Fake fur is made from oil based chemicals, fibres of which end up in the sea killing wildlife. Shooting the animal and using the hide is a much more eco friendly approach.
2636 2018-04-18 19:08:16 Fair, and in full transparency I probably haven’t changed my own oil since high school, but mainly because I haven’t had the facilities down here like back home haha
2637 2018-04-18 19:08:04 Whatever. That transmission is proabably under warranty, and if I can drive the car without ever putting oil in it,  why can’t I use the spare where and when I need it?

2646 2018-04-18 19:07:04 oil prices tanked year ago - that's why they don't have money anymore. This was all reported a few years ago as the large part of the reason the programs nearly folded.
2647 2018-04-18 19:07:01 Got an oil change at @FowlerToyotaTUL and they washed my car and I barely recognized it. 
2648 2018-04-18 19:07:00 ...and now the new air filter, fresh oil & fuel has been installed in the mower.  I'd hoped for a calm day to mow the Annex 1 block west, but maybe tomorrow...
2649 2018-04-18 19:06:54 Only 1/3 voted for Trump. However, in a word America is corrupt. Its electoral system is corrupt. Its politicians owned by @NRA big pharma, big banks, big oil, big etc are corrupt. The guns are about keeping their small arms industry in profit. This country goes to war for money
2650 2018-04-18 19:06:54 Nationalise it, use it internally, lessen dependence on foreign oil, transition to renewable while retraining workers for the new energy economy.
2651 2018-04-18 19:06:44 Finally getting the car washed and the oil changed. I'm trying to be productive today instead of sitting on my ass at home.
2652 2018-04-18 19:06:29 Venezuela isn't even socialist. It's suffering from a crisis deliberately engineered by US-backed corporations in order to punish the country for refusing to surrender their oil fields to US control.

2658 2018-04-18 19:05:47 What a load of crap, there is no evidence Assad has used chemicals, but there is proof that ISIS has many times, all our politicians are puppets to the Elites who want their OIL.
2659 2018-04-18 19:05:45 Breaking down that into energy using different enzymes could be the same price as gas and oil
2660 2018-04-18 19:05:42 there is none, sadly. People being taken advantage of... the latest iteration of snake oil salesmen. Best that might happen is a placebo effect, the worst, people turning away from genuine science that could help them

2666 2018-04-18 19:05:08 WTF did I just read? Please don't tweet something you have no understanding of. The Federal Reserve has no direct influence over gas prices. BTW gas prices are just starting. Oil will hit at least $80 this year and gas will go higher too.

REAL tough call. Don't hate me.

2673 2018-04-18 19:04:38 How can this happen when we’re told that America is now The worlds supplier of oil.??  We export oil.? Don’t we?

2683 2018-04-18 19:03:42 ...the omega-6 content is about 1/3, & 1/3 monounsaturated which is better than some vegetable oils. However, personally, I will choose olive oil & coconut oil over this. If you choose rice bran oil, I would say perhaps include it in variety w/other fats I listed in my posts
2684 2018-04-18 19:03:31 Wrap:
Equities mildly higher; oil surging to new multi-year highs; NZD continuing to head south, touching a low of 0.7304. Most Kiwi-crosses following suit - NZDGBP the exception after UK CPI unexpectedly dropped to 1y low.
2685 2018-04-18 19:03:26 What I don’t understand is why can’t we produce, process and sell within our own country vs selling our oil to the states then buying it back or buying shipped in exports.  We can support ourselves sufficiently. Also, money would stay in our own country.  This ticks me off.
2686 2018-04-18 19:03:11 It still uses oil, just supposed to be a lot less oil
2687 2018-04-18 19:03:10 Nice try, but you are clueless. Venezuela's problems are due to the US, who've waged economic way on the country for decades because they refuse to hand  their oil fields over to Exxon. US backed corporations have created an intentional food shortage in retaliation.
2688 2018-04-18 19:03:02 Ooooh won't they get fined for obstructing the flow of oil.

2702 2018-04-18 19:01:29 @lucybeecoconut just posted a hay fever tip on Instagram using the oil!
2703 2018-04-18 19:01:29 Well this blow her mind: because of the relative efficiencies of electric engines to liquid fuel ones, we need only 1/3 of the total energy to power an electric fleet over a filthy one. And we can easily make that all ourselves. Ban oil.

2704 2018-04-18 19:01:17 The brute was sitting down at his meeting table, feet popped up upon the desk as he started to clean Lucille with some oil, he always hated waiting but hopefully not for too long.

He already sent out someone to go and look for Vienna and bring her to him immediately and that—

2714 2018-04-18 19:00:23 These threats have got to stop. The US is in Syria illegally and has no business dictating terms to anyone. It simply amounts to the US stealing land and oil using the threat of war.

2717 2018-04-18 19:00:16 Thanks for reading Ashok! Glad you liked them. I'm not super familiar w/rice bran oil, but I see that it is produced in a similar manner as industrial seed oils, w/solvents, etc. The smoke point is high which is good, however, I'm not sure about aldehyde production w/heating...

2725 2018-04-18 18:59:21 Agree on the weekly resistance and supply level at 40.20. It should test that and then turn, but given oil near 70 I think it might also blow right through that level. It's all matter of finding that overextended point where it turns quick. Might grab some of that $DRIP soon

2728 2018-04-18 18:58:56 There is more natural gas in America than oil in the middle east. Oil for war is a myth. It's about using war as a tool of the World Bank and Rothschilds
2729 2018-04-18 18:58:40 2/and as for Alberta, we are agile,and have learned to expand and contract with oil prices-  but never have we been kicked when we’re already down by our own government.

2736 2018-04-18 18:57:47 90% net long in oil was seen In the months leading into the big drops of 2009, 2012, 2014.

2738 2018-04-18 18:57:33 but wait are you using MCT oil in your BP coffee? i read that the triglycerides are better than coconut oil. meanwhile i end up putting soy milk and sugar most of the time since that's all we have in the office and black coffee tastes yucky
2739 2018-04-18 18:57:20 the anarchist girl in this class asked why america didn’t start making fuel efficient cars like japan did after the 1973 oil crisis

2743 2018-04-18 18:56:54 As a Canadian you have benefited directly from Oil. Not Alberta’s oil but rather Canada’s oil. I agree the Heritage Trust fund was a failure and all of us should be upset about that and also with the record debt Trudeau is accumulating
2744 2018-04-18 18:56:53 changed my oil by myself today. I’m officially a man now. Shouts out to @YouTube for the help
2745 2018-04-18 18:56:50 Good to know. The question if whether vegans should consume palm oil in light of it's associated cruelty to wildlife is a good one. All I can say is that with palm oil, animal cruelty can be avoided whereas with butter or lard, there's no way to avoid animal cruelty
2746 2018-04-18 18:56:46 Hahahaha what?! Your calling Vancouverites overweight? Have you seen Albertans?! It's called Texas of the north for a reason and not just the oil.
2747 2018-04-18 18:56:43 Sorry, can't help you there. All #PalmOil is the same & so-called sustainable began with deforestation (non-sustainable) before being certified. As I've said before certified is mixed with regular palm oil so your support is supporting further deforestation. Goodnight

2749 2018-04-18 18:56:35 I find it very interesting that TED Talk would bring up the discussion of data visualization. David McCandless brought up a very interesting fact about data visualization. Data is the "new oil" but could also be looked at as the "new soil" because you can do so much with data.
2750 2018-04-18 18:56:35 Pretty tough talk first you don't want Alberta Oil then you threaten to take court action if they choose to restrict it . I have a better idea how about a made in Alberta oil price for the lower mainland customers.
2751 2018-04-18 18:56:34 What oil?!?! I want to make sure I order the right thing.
2752 2018-04-18 18:56:32 Do you have answer for Zinke selling them off to big oil and upping the price of admission?  If you don't, then it's clear we need to vote you out in November!
2753 2018-04-18 18:56:26 Its very conservative estimate . Oil price would average $70 this year, Surplus could be much higher.
2754 2018-04-18 18:56:18 That last point re: Bancor is so interesting b/c it appears that is precisely the system China is constructing thru CNY oil & gold contracts.

2766 2018-04-18 18:54:37 Well I've had an email today from a Nigerian oil company asking for my bank account number and sort code as I am related to a dead shareholder
So maybe we make a pact and ignore both
2767 2018-04-18 18:54:36 I agree there’ll be a fiscal crisis due to debt spending and inflation, but as long as we continue progress oil won’t be a world ending issue. Maybe just continue kicking around some middle eastern countries though
2768 2018-04-18 18:54:32 Nooooope. This is from the guy that lived in S Korea for a long time. He has spent far too much time and capital (political as well as money) to give them up. Plus, we'd been here before with a heavy oil deal that was a bogus play
2769 2018-04-18 18:54:29 Time for @AndrewScheer , CPC & fiscally sane Canadians everywhere to take the gloves off & educate the naive populace as to why we MUST produce & export our energy resources; why pipelines are good, not bad; & why producing oil from Canada is BETTER than corrupt foreign regimes.

2796 2018-04-18 18:51:49 Not really, they've been leaking oil through the compressor, now that's not possible because FIA installed all sorts of sensors (including in the main oil tank) monitoring the oil flow. Therfore, Ferrari had to find a different solution, if any.

2811 2018-04-18 18:49:33 $TK not an oil price play though. It's more of a LNG shipping play.
2812 2018-04-18 18:49:30 I always ask what would trump do if he didn't have to answer to our system of checks and balances. The answer to date, remove all sanctions, any and all obstacles to foreign oil, real estate, go for all-out partnership in arms control with Russia. Remain in power.

2822 2018-04-18 18:48:21 So much for trickle down economics. People got more in their pays. Oil prices up Price gouging at the gas pumps, food prices went up. So people end up with no extra spendable money.

Calgary has high unemployment because far too much of the Alberta economy is derived from oil.  When the price tanked, so did the jobs.  It has nothing to do with this pipeline
2831 2018-04-18 18:47:31 it’s funny how a $10 + bottle of olive oil goes in like 2 days, but that wack $3 bottle of canola vegetable oil trash lasts a whole lifetime cause you can recycle that jont in to-go chinese  soup containers
2832 2018-04-18 18:47:28 Matter a fact america don't you have some climate changing to do. or some oil fields to take over?

2835 2018-04-18 18:47:09 I would like to clear my name. It’s actually a very fancy body BUTTER with Argan Oil that you can only find in the UK. This slander against me shall not go unchallenged. Let the record state.
2836 2018-04-18 18:47:09 And that was how you got to conclude, Nigerian youths are lazy forgetting the struggles of many including @MrFestus Keyamo who happens to be a mentor of many of my likes. Am sorry Mr President we not lazy. The leaders that depends on crude oil are more lazy than we are.
2837 2018-04-18 18:47:08 @Webnut Big Pharma created this nightmare they should pay for the clean up just like oil companies. Congress needs to go after them

2840 2018-04-18 18:46:38 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
2841 2018-04-18 18:46:38 The way slay queens are swallowing shots of tequila here @valhallakampala reminds me about the gone days when mum told me to give hens cooking oil whenever coccidiosis hit our small poultry. 

I have come from far you guy! 
2842 2018-04-18 18:46:38 Yeah, obviously Hogg needs attention. Hope he enjoys it while it lasts.

2845 2018-04-18 18:46:09 Oil companies working in the Tar Sands are most keen. And of course Alberta govt who collects royalties. And Canadian govt who gets money from Alberta.
2846 2018-04-18 18:46:07 Price you pay for being so deliciously yummy..

Sorry you have been biten. Have u tried citronella oil to keep them away?
2847 2018-04-18 18:46:06 You and your Republican cohorts gave your rich friends and the oil & gas companies that support you financially permanent cuts. You gave us Okies temp. cuts. Our grandchildren just got shit on by you and yours with a huge debt
2848 2018-04-18 18:46:02 “More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education for free.”
2849 2018-04-18 18:46:01 Corn and Sunflower oil both are high in polyunsaturated fatty acid and olive oil isn’t great for cooking at high temps. I would imagine avocado oil would do better because it’s low poly/high monounsaturated content and high smoke point.
2850 2018-04-18 18:45:58 Oil soars 2.9% to 3-year high, settling at $68.47, as US crude stockpiles drop

2873 2018-04-18 18:44:04 All the complex theories about how oil was being burnt and it was as simple as feeding oil into the inlet, now they are feeding it in via the turbo

2891 2018-04-18 18:41:56 We are watching closely but it will take more than Ont, we have had 2 mayors shut down 2 pipelines , we as a province need a pipeline to tidewater so we can get market value for our oil, meanwhile we continually subsidize the same leeching provinces year in and out .

2893 2018-04-18 18:41:50 @PepsiCo: Stop trying to greenwash the loophole in your #palmoil policy that enables your business partners to destroy rainforests and exploit workers. Fix your palm oil policy and end your role in deforestation and exploitation!

2895 2018-04-18 18:41:43 "Mysterious oil spill" this obviously wasn't from a regulated and government controlled pipeline. This isn't an accurate comparison at ALL!

In fact, did you know BC has never had an oil tanker spill

Would you rather our oil be transported via rail or truck? (far more dangerous)

2897 2018-04-18 18:41:35 Harper said he was going to phase out the oil sands at a G7 meeting around 3 years ago. Do you have any actual principles or is everything you Tweet out just done for blind partisanship and political gain?

2901 2018-04-18 18:41:15 even worse - it's not clearly marked. Disguised as 'vegetable oil' or few other names

2918 2018-04-18 18:39:30 I'm sincerely glad for you that you are asking questions. No legit company would take this long to be 100% transparent with their well results. Nor would they issue a PR meant to give false hope of commercial quantities of oil and then be raising capital at the same time.

2921 2018-04-18 18:39:03 that's too bad, I can't think of any scent quite as sedating. (I sure can recommend some tisanes/teas though!) Peppermint scent for nausea is a godsend, that's the only other oil I find really effective.

2966 2018-04-18 18:34:34 Good news - let’s hope we can build some momentum now just when oil is moving ahead - I might even stop whinging
2967 2018-04-18 18:34:26 Leonor Greyl magnolia face oil. And their hair oil. All natural, decades old formulas, gentle and FRENCH!
2968 2018-04-18 18:34:22 Secure, private phone, reserved for making deals with the Oil Industry. He gives them OUR LAND, shouldn't we the taxpayers get some of the benefit?? AT LEAST AS MUCH AS HE IS BANKING!
2969 2018-04-18 18:34:19 Damn it, I should’ve followed my gut on oil prices.
2970 2018-04-18 18:34:12 Selective memory strikes again......simliar to Mr (oil) Wood now as of 2016 Sir Wood. Amazing how a knigthhood changes their memory eh.  .. Thank god we remember.
2971 2018-04-18 18:34:10 Your going to get rid of you vehicle? Maybe not heat your home with oil or natural gas? Maybe import oil from countries that abuse human rights?
2972 2018-04-18 18:34:04 Here's an idea for your next project! Oil pastels + clocks + fables + shadow! Go!
2973 2018-04-18 18:33:45 Maybe. I always wondered if part of the epidemiological effect is not due to people preparing their meat in bad ways (frying in oil, HCA, PAH, ...) That, plus the fact that burgers come on a bun (and go with fries and soda and ... and...)
2974 2018-04-18 18:33:38 I did oil and vinegar and some basil.
2975 2018-04-18 18:33:37 I wish there was service that picked up your car, provided an oil change and wash, then returned.
2976 2018-04-18 18:33:30 After cleaning new wok, toss a bunch of chives or spring onions into wok with oil, stir fry on highest heat until black. Rinse and wipe the wok. Now ready to start cooking.
2977 2018-04-18 18:33:29 Breaking (2:33 PM EDT): Oil soars 2.9% to 3-year high, settling at $68.47, as US crude stockpiles drop... -- CNBC
2978 2018-04-18 18:33:29 I agree totally. what happens if URHOBO Nation decide to suspend oil and gas exploration in their domain, area of influence, for 90 days, i mean, imagine that scenario.
2979 2018-04-18 18:33:15 Follow in the elephants tracks!
2980 2018-04-18 18:33:02 Totally with you on that one.cant keep pollution going and the oil won't last forever.

2984 2018-04-18 18:32:40 We don't govern by fickle polls.     We're a country governed by the rule of law, and as such we need to wait until ALL the courts cases make their way through the courts.

SCC will most likely put an end to the Texas oil corps pipeline.    #cdnpoli #bcpoli #StopKM
2985 2018-04-18 18:32:36 Did u try tea tree oil ?
2986 2018-04-18 18:32:28 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
2987 2018-04-18 18:32:24 yeah! i have/had oily skin as well and a lot of times making sure its moisturized properly with things like hyaluronic acid will tame the oil and keep it hydrated but not greasy/oily Not sure if you’ve done it before, i’m just speaking from personal experience
2988 2018-04-18 18:32:21 Coconut oil
2989 2018-04-18 18:32:14 Hi Alfie, have you adjusted your outlook on crude oil?
2990 2018-04-18 18:32:02 Km is not getting built. He can't even last 3 days from that before he slams oil and gas.
2991 2018-04-18 18:31:43 @nipsey I made another batch of the almond cookies. They came out the SAME! I used brown sugar this time. I can't believe it! Now I'm thinking that maybe instead of butter, I used coconut oil the first time. This is frustratingggggg!!
2992 2018-04-18 18:31:35 Spent the morning working with grandson, the husband decided it was a great day to catch his waste oil burner on fire but, thank goodness we caught it before it took over the shop. Now time to crack the books before anything else transpires
2993 2018-04-18 18:31:27 Based on working 12 months a year, which they don't, average pay is $73,000.
2994 2018-04-18 18:31:25 US is world's leading producer oil now. They have some of the biggest reserves, money and technology to extract oil from hydrates in future. There could be many US interests but oil/gas is not one of them. This old school of thought is no more valid.
2995 2018-04-18 18:31:25 だいたいそんな感じですね。カード資産引継ぎ有りの後継機って感じ。

2997 2018-04-18 18:31:21 My problem now is, my gen no wan on. I dunno if its oil or plug.... And it looks like we wont have light today 
2998 2018-04-18 18:30:48 I used to volunteer at a food pantry. These got donated all the time. It's actually safer than peanut butter, which can go rancid w/ changing temperatures. The can is hermetically sealed & its contents pasteurized.
It's not the best thing for you (salt/oil), but is safe to eat.
2999 2018-04-18 18:30:36 This soil is not good for a few (temperature sensitive) crops while it’s good for almost everything else.

May be we weren’t gifted with oil but we earn income by selling nature. Politico’s be like;

“Gudhurathee vaseelaiy thah madhu, beyruge ufehdhun thakah baroasaa vaa” STFU…

3005 2018-04-18 18:30:23 Going to be VERY interesting to see when the correlation between $SPX and #oil will diverge.... It's a mirror trade.... Good if you are long oil I guess but oh boy I can't wait till another #fed hitting the bid

3011 2018-04-18 18:29:57 Ikr but is it an excuse for the lowly to always give while the politicians dominate and loot? If people had done something earlier things wouldn't be like this, people were alive when crude oil took over,before things got worse but did nothing cos they're about the present.
3012 2018-04-18 18:29:51 I will keep the boat surrounded at all times by an oil slick that can be ignited at a moment's notice
3013 2018-04-18 18:29:34 Here's the thing - the oil sands at some point will be phased out. They just will. Cpc needs to accept that and prepare for it. Basically, they need to start facing reality, instead of simply trying to turn back the clocks on every single issue.
3014 2018-04-18 18:29:33 This is a gas guzzling pig.  Up to 15 city / 22 highway 
Oil is up to $70 per barrel & Trump is having it head back to $145 all time high with crappy policies & corrupt administration.   Get fuel efficient.
3015 2018-04-18 18:29:29 My head was swimming after reading that. You’d think with all of the oil money the Alaska colleges would be strong.
3016 2018-04-18 18:29:27 According to @MBuhari
“More than 60% of Nigeria population are below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil  producing country, therefore, they shld sit and do nothing, and get  housing, healthcare, education free”.
Why the ridicule?
3017 2018-04-18 18:29:25 Oil? We’re already in this very day moving past oil as a fuel for vehicles. If we keep progressing, we’ll have oil leftover by the time we’ve moved on. Humanity is capable of incredible things, amigo. We just have to stop shackling ourselves
3018 2018-04-18 18:29:08 @sfosternyc Halloween costume idea: Olive Oil. 

Like, the Popeye character, not the foodstuff.

Wait—that could be funny too.
3019 2018-04-18 18:29:05 OIL closes at session highs today!  No need to worry because the USA can always drill more now that Democrat rules are off of us.  Deregulation allows Americans to solve our own problems!  #VoteGOP #MAGA @cspanwj #PGNET #TCOT #TLOT #P2
3020 2018-04-18 18:28:54 @FoxNews owner @RupertMurdoch sits on the board of Israeli oil company Genie Energy that wants to drill for oil on the Occupied Golan Heights in violation of Geneva Accords( a war crime) don’t expect to hear his on @FoxNews
3021 2018-04-18 18:28:51 I have the afternoon off work on Friday the 27th, the day of the Oil Rumble, should I watch it?
3022 2018-04-18 18:28:37 Oil under Obama couldn't get to $50 a barrel, it is now up to nearly $70! Once again, proving Dems were wrong! We are actually exporting oil now! Can you imagine that? *doing my happy dance*
3023 2018-04-18 18:28:35 Oil change or just to come?
3024 2018-04-18 18:28:16 North Korea with Oil
3025 2018-04-18 18:28:10 I hope it doesn't turn out like that crap they used for the oil spill in the gulf. Smh. We need to do something about it, but it's getting into living things now too. The hemp made stuff would save the future.
3026 2018-04-18 18:28:04 Ladies, if ya mans can’t change his own tire/oil, you might wanna reevaluate because you got ya self a girlfriend

3029 2018-04-18 18:27:38 Did my oil change and the guy was loving my truck
3030 2018-04-18 18:27:27 Yes and that subsidy is for fracked gas and oil too; as in new fracked gas plants; as in the new Xcel deal.
3031 2018-04-18 18:27:24 This applies to ALL So call WHITE PEOPLE young or old.  PSALM 55:21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords. Evil in the beginning and Evil today and will be evil tomorrow.

3035 2018-04-18 18:26:39 As the rest of the world is finally starting to break away from the #DarkAges the guy under me is trying to suck the U.S. back into them!  #CoalIsDead #ClimateChange is real and the only reason he likes #Oil so much is because he needs it to lather through me! #Yuck

3038 2018-04-18 18:25:50 คณะไรหรอ
3039 2018-04-18 18:25:49 I need some kind of tutorial on olive oil. I think the main thing is: Don't buy the giant bottles at CostCo because they'll go bad before you can use them all.

"More buttery" sounds divine.
3040 2018-04-18 18:25:45 My oil change is going to cost 50 dollars but I get a 7 dollar target card so I guess 
3041 2018-04-18 18:25:41 Need some neq paint brush and oil pastel. Dada?! Baka naman diba?

3043 2018-04-18 18:25:25 Yeah. And the A/C is considerably less expensive to run than my oil furnace.
3044 2018-04-18 18:25:10 Coconut oil has just melted. Summer is officially here
3045 2018-04-18 18:25:00 So Alberta give them money so they can rely on foreign oil to supply thier needs. Also dumping raw sewage into the water. You can’t make this stuff up
3046 2018-04-18 18:24:53 @Crain's Hyundai getting an oil change,  they trying to talk me into getting a new car...I'll pass this time
3047 2018-04-18 18:24:44 Ah it's been over 10 years since we discovered oil right? 
3048 2018-04-18 18:24:36 yea honestly you can go without I feel lol and just add in sunflower oil too
3049 2018-04-18 18:24:32 Anywhere but here
3050 2018-04-18 18:24:32 You would not exist if it was not for the constant support of UK/US for decades and the oil they want.

3054 2018-04-18 18:23:48 #BharatKiBaatSabkeSaath what is @narendramodi doing for controlling the #DigitalIndia now while #CashCrunchOrNot. Why there is #Dange everywhere. Why oil prices highest in India. Why ministries are not giving up for #subsidies @prasoonjoshi_ plz ask
3055 2018-04-18 18:23:48 The capitalists rob the planet, rip it open for oil and gold, and leave us with nothing but labor.
3056 2018-04-18 18:23:42 Wrong. The capital was in horrible condition and needed repairs.  They were voted for when oil was up.  Now oil is down so yes there’s less money.
3057 2018-04-18 18:23:38 Hello everyone! We recently replaced our personal care items containing palm oil with ones that do not contain palm oil. Pictures will be posted shortly  #palmoil #environment #deforestation #endangeredspecies #makeadifference #asimpleswitch

3066 2018-04-18 18:23:01 Use a little olive oil on the end of a Q-tip to remove eyeliner (and it won't sting if it gets in your eyes)

3068 2018-04-18 18:22:53 you find out something new daily did you leave when the oil took a dive
3069 2018-04-18 18:22:44 The real finger should also be ptd at the petroleum industry,the pipeline industry. We have their empty promises. As today we have another pipe line brake and oil spill in northern Alberta.Burard inlet will get oil spills in the water,promises.
3070 2018-04-18 18:22:41 blame the oil. i been feeling mad sluggish, if you didnt have any then idk lol

3073 2018-04-18 18:22:37 Well JT was telling France he wants to get rid of the oil sands so this is no surprise. He is a drama teacher and just acting when he said the pipeline will be built!!!  CANADA........ we need @AndrewScheer for PM!!!!!
3074 2018-04-18 18:22:30 he's only there to collect his checks from big oil, big pharma, the NRA, and every other 1% who's happy to throw cash at him to destroy the country

3078 2018-04-18 18:22:07 Take it easy pal! All the typing may have started hurting your fingers  you obviously know nothing about me, or our country. It’s obvious Modi can’t control international oil prices, but that seems beyond your intelligence level
3079 2018-04-18 18:21:52 All Religion is a Form of Madness! Makes me mad! Scientology is the only true science! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!

#AlternativeFacts much?
Just sayin’ something doesn’t make it so - and the avalanche of EVIDENCE Against Oil&Gas will Tear You Down.
Unfortunately, the future of whole planet is now in peril Because Of YOU #sociopaths
3081 2018-04-18 18:21:46 And YES @TweetShawniece if you offer to drive and then pull the ‘my car needs an oil change n gas’, OWN IT! Don’t put it on Jephte that you dropped the ball, even if it wasn’t a big deal. Jus sayin. #typicalmarriageissues that’s the same  my wife n I disagree about #TeamShefte
3082 2018-04-18 18:21:46 hopefully you won’t have to contend with newly rich oil baron James Dean.
3083 2018-04-18 18:21:39 No. Build the pipeline already. It's the best, most efficient way to transport large quantities of oil, and great for the Canadian economy. Down with the red tape!
3084 2018-04-18 18:21:31 $USDCAD Oil is really spiking now, over $68.36 now. If Oil hits $70, then this pair will go below 1.24

3093 2018-04-18 18:20:35 Would you rather use the most responsibly and ethically produced oil in the world or prop up authoritarian dictatorships like Iran, Venezuela, Saudi, and Russia?
3094 2018-04-18 18:20:33 Next time, saute ya some onions and put those Jalapenos in with the onions.  Saute slightly with very light oil, and seasoning if u like.  BAM!!!! ;-) <3

3097 2018-04-18 18:20:24 I'm gonna have to abstain.  By that I mean I'm going to splash Danish oil on my middle.
3098 2018-04-18 18:20:23 I have been taking evening primrose oil now for nearly 2 weeks now and I have noticed a big difference in my anxiety and I don't feel so much anxious no more and I feel a lot better and evening primrose oil really does work for anxiety 
3099 2018-04-18 18:20:08 There case is like “the man we desire to roast in fire, rubbing palm oil on his body” 
3100 2018-04-18 18:20:00 I picked up said bottle & shown him, nice way to put u at ease, suspicious mind, how can u mistake bio oil with alcohol? 
3101 2018-04-18 18:19:56 i loved it, but honestly I feel like just switching to oils will do the same thing. After I finished it I started using vitamin e oil and rose hip oil and my skin is amazing lol

3104 2018-04-18 18:19:42 “Fake” or Synthetic oil is primarily used in most cars & trucks. It was invented in 1943 in Berlin. Today, most petroleum based lubricants are made with the same process the Germans (Nazi) developed, so no, noone needs any petroleum products for any machinery...anymore. @cnnbrk
3105 2018-04-18 18:19:39 Y’all be so green everybody in they mammy knows once work picks up in the oil field gas prices go up..You rather good paying jobs r hardly any jobs at all and cheaper gas bird?

3107 2018-04-18 18:19:25 Surely this is the Saudis attempting to get the maximum out of their oil reserves in order to fund the diversification of their economy? For example the much lauded introduction of Cinemas to Saudi Arabia hides the fact that these will be owned by the sovereign wealth fund.

3109 2018-04-18 18:19:10 To say such utter rubbish in the abroad makes my blood boil? What oil money? Asides the "free" primary & junior secondary education I received -- whose funding is arguably UN backed, what has Nigeria done for me? Abeg, these people should take a back seat & keep verrrrry quiet!

3112 2018-04-18 18:18:56 They need beds in places like Firestone so you can nap while you're getting an oil change. That would be fire.

3117 2018-04-18 18:18:24 I'll give u an example of this court phycologist walks in my hse obviously read I have struggled with alcohol from time to time, hadn't drank for a couple of months _ first words "is that alcohol under ur coffee table?" My reply no its a bottle of bio oil smh #truestory 
3118 2018-04-18 18:18:10 $60 oil change turned into a $4100 ordeal because of crack and fluid leak... my day has started splendidly 
3119 2018-04-18 18:17:49 #Amer  us LTH are loving the amount of news, plus the directors buys and the change in the trend with the share price. Long may it continue. can’t wait now for the drills to start turning and some impressive oil discoveries.. 
3120 2018-04-18 18:17:47 Every indicator out there says that oil is overblown and due for a serious correction yet it keeps ramping up relentlessly. Can't remember the last time commercials were this wrong and the dumb money was actually winning hands down. Bizzare times indeed.
3121 2018-04-18 18:17:32 Never thought about using the acv and tea tree oil as a toner. What are your thoughts so far?
3122 2018-04-18 18:17:16 Haha it’s all good! If you’re looking to do like ~intense~ repair you could look into the macadamia oil brand. Their stuff is pricey but mariah has it and has let me use it and that stuff works miracles
3123 2018-04-18 18:17:11 Should add US access to oil & other natural resources, too. The US, assisted by its NATO vassals, doesn't only operate in The Middle East but worldwide. That disgusting self-appointed world police.
3124 2018-04-18 18:17:00 Tough one? Too much money involved for it not to happen. In a perfect world no one wants oil shipped, but the fact is, it's being shipped regardless via train. It's the tanker traffic that will double or triple that's scary on the inside passage. Rest of Canada doesn't get that.

3139 2018-04-18 18:15:39 I agree with some, but who actually changes their own oil? You can find coupons for like $17 oil changes. The oil alone costs like $11. I'm not gonna get that down and dirty for 6 bucks

3154 2018-04-18 18:14:04 If you're that interested in going green, stop drilling oil and change your business model to green energies such as wind, wave and solar. You made 6 BILLION dollars in profit last year. Do more

3182 2018-04-18 18:11:31 Yeah this is real let down from that beautiful oil painting they had on the last cover. Quite underwhelming and not in line with their style imo
3183 2018-04-18 18:11:30 But hey, I don’t know what I’m talking about. I’ve only been telling you this stuff for 6 months now. When oil was at $50 you told me I’d see it from your side soon enough. Here we are at $68...soon still?

3190 2018-04-18 18:10:53 we should use efficient sources of oil that don’t crap all over our territory. with massive cleaner reserves out there we have no excuse to keep it up. tarsands aren’t an alternative to more efficient sources of energy, the same way coal isn’t. moving backward isn’t transitioning

3203 2018-04-18 18:09:30 I don't disagree with you.

3233 2018-04-18 18:06:43 I just found out I get free oil changes from the dealership I bought my car at bless up.
3234 2018-04-18 18:06:37 You deserve it. It was the most enjoyable non-technical oil & gas book I’ve read since The Prize.

And so the  is justified?

3241 2018-04-18 18:05:34 Cause that worked well for 1920s banks, rockefeller’s oil, and AT&T right?
3242 2018-04-18 18:05:19 @PepsiCo 
Stop green washing your palm oil policy. Examine the traceability of your sources. No rainforests should have been destroyed in its production.
3243 2018-04-18 18:05:13 Minister Richard Harrington summing up for the UK government on Industrial Strategy fails to address ANYTHING for Scotland and for Energy, oil and gas. No answers to any issues raised. Secretary of State earlier admitted their decisions have a big impact on Scotland yet nothing.
3244 2018-04-18 18:05:06 Brent (+1.94%) at $72.97/bbl, WTI (+2.29%) at $68.04/bbl; whopping intraday jump on claims #SaudiArabia wants $100 oil price, with #HedgeFunds piling in to see if the rally holds #OOTT #oilandgas
3245 2018-04-18 18:05:06 Fresh oil change and premium gas quality does matter
3246 2018-04-18 18:04:48 With that amount of smoke dissipating throughout a GP I really don't understand how they're staying within the new oil loss limits.

3257 2018-04-18 18:03:08 Dunno? Maybe due to the fact they rep 5000 fishers & 7000 oil, plant, grocery, etc workers here? Maybe due to nobody wanting to be part of UNIFOR's overall plan? They are the parent of the FFAW.I don't know, but I don't agree with him one but here! #Sustainability & logic needed

3272 2018-04-18 18:01:36 Yes, of course.  The Oil.

You know Iran aren't really the problem in that region.
3273 2018-04-18 18:01:36 Thinking, because we still haven't had our spring, crops are going to be late into the ground this year and we will be wondering about where our food is going to come from, if our climate continues as such  but we always have oil
3274 2018-04-18 18:01:30 taking oil of oregano is kinda weird bc at first it’s fucking GROSS and then you swallow it and your whole mouth tastes like a pizza

3276 2018-04-18 18:01:18 It's not about the oil, either.
3277 2018-04-18 18:01:09 Then the US government should end the subsidies of US oil & gas companies, and farming subsidies to name a few.
3278 2018-04-18 18:01:05 From where I am standing they seem to be doing quite alright.

OPEC is all.about stabilizing cycles, not market share. And quite frankly they have always had less impact than they are assigned. Oil is moving because the shale scam is coming unglued.

3313 2018-04-18 17:58:05 He & G. Butts have this loopy idea that we can easily transition to

What kind of olive oil do you get, I mean, specific brand(s).
3328 2018-04-18 17:56:45 At least oil was a long-term call ("in his lifetime").

3363 2018-04-18 17:52:06 Why not try some natural things like coconut oil, black seed oil and Chlorella....etc.
3364 2018-04-18 17:52:02 Jamaican castor oil and coconut oil!
3365 2018-04-18 17:51:52 Garlic, extra virgin olive oil, sumac/paprika/cumic, lemon, sea salt.
3366 2018-04-18 17:51:48 I hate myself for needing to stand up for aioli, but they’re only the same because they’re both emulsions. Aioli starts with garlic paste and specifically uses olive oil. Mayo uses canola oil usually and no garlic.
3367 2018-04-18 17:51:41 Why @AWAKEALERT ? Is this about oil? Is this about the pipeline?
3368 2018-04-18 17:51:38 that's not hypocrisy, it's a genuine interest in a sustainable future. Alberta's tarsands represent the worst form of oil extraction on the planet - it poisons huge quantities of fresh water, requires massive amounts of energy to extract/process and destroys Alberta's ecosystem

3376 2018-04-18 17:50:43 I was supposed to get an oil change 4000 miles ago lmao
3377 2018-04-18 17:50:41 Ya be smoking trash oil? 
3378 2018-04-18 17:50:30 What if they shot up on volatility bets that linked transports and oil to volatility expirations occurring today?  Why would transports rise on higher fuel costs?  The great mistake of the modern market era is imputing rational thought to stock moves.
3379 2018-04-18 17:50:18 No more tweets till silver hits 20 before gold and oil even move LOL
3380 2018-04-18 17:50:15 I don't think it's a case of them saying all use of oil is bad but our use of it should not be at the expense of indigenous people or our rivers and oceans. To do so undermines the Paris climate agreement. All so oil companies can make even more money? It's unethical at best

3386 2018-04-18 17:49:59 ahhhh i got you for sure on the oil! thank you so much, sending joy and laughter and good food your way!! 
3387 2018-04-18 17:49:32 I'd roast cherry tomatoes, red oinions, garlic, peppers and make a fresh tomato sauce. Boil some penne pasta. Mixed and drizzle the delicious chill oil. 
Also potatoes wedges, cover them in herbs and chill oil and bake... THIS IS MAKING ME HUNGRY 
3388 2018-04-18 17:49:32 I just got online now and this was at the very top of my feed! We love you "Oil Tot". I will be checking it out soon!

3395 2018-04-18 17:49:04 Use an oven for fried foods. Add small amount of vegetable oil for baked foods & vegetables. Microwave sometimes miss spots that an oven doesn’t. Microwaves are only good for pastas & shit like that. Jus add a little water before heating
3396 2018-04-18 17:48:59 For an evening this gorgeous, I'd have thought your preparation would have involved checking the oil and tearing off the tonneau cover.
3397 2018-04-18 17:48:58 Honours like that are seriously diminished by giving them out to snake oil salesmen. 
3398 2018-04-18 17:48:54 The body shops tea tree oil face wash and foam wash really helps. The face mask helps as well, and being consistent with them helps the most. Also I know everyone says this but increase your water intake and try  not to eat too much junk food. The aveeno face wash also helps
3399 2018-04-18 17:48:40 I remember Ralph Stanley, the grandfather of bluegrass. He did NOT kill half a million people to privatize oil for personal profit.

3401 2018-04-18 17:48:35 Mind you suggesting we need the "right balance" at all pre-supposes there is some existential risk in transporting oil by pipelines that must be "balanced" - and there is no evidence that is the case...
3402 2018-04-18 17:48:31 Well, it's not that straightforward: geologic processes could well bring deep (or newer) oil reserves to the surface since then.

However we're now extracting oil from pretty old rocks, through fracking, for example.
3403 2018-04-18 17:48:30 Watch oil prices. They need them to go up. Oligarchs, illegal banking, Russian pipelines, etc. It's all part of the plan.
3404 2018-04-18 17:48:23 So is your complaint that you want ENIC to sell to a Russian oligarch or middle east oil money?
3405 2018-04-18 17:48:16 It’s the only comeback they have lol

3412 2018-04-18 17:47:50 Funny the slump in oil prices didn’t send all other oil producing nations into hyperinflation. It must be just had luck or something right? 
3413 2018-04-18 17:47:35 Chef Gusteau cut up some potatoes, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a blue stop sign, along with gravy.

We must be wise as children of God #secondcomingofchrist
3415 2018-04-18 17:47:29 @JustinTrudeau after all we have been thru on the prairies and the rest of Canada due to the oil prices. @RBC feels that 11.5 billion in profits is not enough. Now they are raising rates and cost of services by 25%. Questions need to be asked?? #RBCRipoff @Bill_Morneau
3416 2018-04-18 17:47:14 WTI oil rises above $68/barrel for the first time since December 2014 - now at $68.04/barrel, up $1.52.

3420 2018-04-18 17:46:54 My mum’s always made it with no butter and no cheese. The solution is chicken stock and olive oil. Sometimes saffron. Also she makes it with basmati rice and finishes it in the oven like a pilaff. Half Italian so must be ok.

3431 2018-04-18 17:45:38 Foreign fossil fuel companies sold $60 billion worth of their stranded assets in Alberta to unwary Canadian investors after the price of oil fell below the cost of refinining bitumen, because they’re in the business, not losing it. What part don’t you get?
3432 2018-04-18 17:45:33 Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia would be happy to see crude rise to $80 or even $100 a barrel, three industry sources said, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to an OPEC supply-cutting deal.

3441 2018-04-18 17:44:45 I think that's a good call.
"biofuel" too is a scam. With the exception of repurposed waste products (cooking oil, etc.) it takes more energy to create a gallon of bio-fuel than that gallon produces when burned.

3444 2018-04-18 17:44:19 I wasn't focusing only on high prices slowing demand; even if everyone drives more despite the higher prices it still results in money going to #oil firms that won't be going to some other entity: a widget maker, savings account, mortgage payments, investments.

3459 2018-04-18 17:43:07 Someone PLEASE commission me to paint this picture.  Oil on something the size of Trump's ego.
3460 2018-04-18 17:43:00 So Trudeau tells France he wants to get rid of our oil sands. He tells Turkey we have no religion or values. His foreign speech’s must be listened to. Trudeaus really is reprehensible when speaking behind our backs.
3461 2018-04-18 17:43:00 You're barking up the wrong tree. Not interested in the least with polls; interested in morality & ethical decisions made for the benefit of all. Climate-change is not going to respond to polls, only going to respond to eliminating oil from our diet.

3466 2018-04-18 17:42:26 There is so much hypocrisy in this movement, China is being commended for its work while building a coal plant a week, BC wags its finger at Alberta and yet coal is their #1 export. No other country or province would leave the oil in the ground if they had our reserves.

3469 2018-04-18 17:42:21 That 42km pipeline is the truth. They plan to bring in foreign fuel to the airport and pipe it in. And you basically want all the benefits of oil just no responsibility. Hypocrisy runs deep

Like a driveway sweep. Goodbye, oil stains
3474 2018-04-18 17:41:58 Fossil fuel will run out, there is nothing clean about the process. I am from oil rich south of Iran, I have seen it with my own eyes. Solar is the solution, so it wind, but more importantly, nuclear. Fossil fuel is solar battery, where do you think oil comes from?

3515 2018-04-18 17:37:39 We should ALL sue them and every oil company on the planet for lying and refusing to transition to Clean Energy decades ago.

3544 2018-04-18 17:34:34 This is actually a good major. Especially in countries where oil is a big thing. You’ll get paid alot, decent position as well. US- Germany- Middle East They all pay good. the Middle East “Dubai” I heard they pay ALOT to oil/ chemical engineers. Kuwait, US. So you’re wanted
3545 2018-04-18 17:34:32 It’s that old catch 22 of the fact we have tethered our entire economy to oil & resources
3546 2018-04-18 17:34:26 Ask Samuel to take you to a place called "Paraiso Tropical". The prices are steep for Bahia but totally worth it. When I went we had some seafruit with grilled fruits that was out of this world. The chef hates processed ingredients so much that he even makes his own palm oil.

3555 2018-04-18 17:32:28 The pensions are weaker today than in almost any generation that preceded this. All state employees are part of the pension system not just teachers . Looks at prison spending. Look a government pensions in general teachers are low hanging fruit and talking points.

3569 2018-04-18 17:30:41 What article was that? Perhaps I can point you to a few of Andrew N. at The Tyee relating oil processing  to the less colonial Norway case? Same sillyness as still shipping raw logs, or not upgrading copper to optic fiber in telecomms...
3570 2018-04-18 17:30:40 It's gotten obvious to most who run RS screens, but the oil stocks are still showing strength. Retested the pivot and held which is good. Key averages up at that 20.55 pivot too. Doesn't have the huge eps others do. Falls under 23ema can possibly test even undercut 50ma.

3629 2018-04-18 17:25:28 Actually, most oil is decomposed plant/algae matter.
Also, I’m sure I’d be a hell of a lot less insightful if I were high/drunk.
3630 2018-04-18 17:25:06 "More than 60% of population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school & they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit & do nothing & get housing, healthcare, education free” - Buhari before world leaders
3631 2018-04-18 17:24:55 Thank you America for funding ISIS?   Arent their weapons American?   Why you involved at all in the first place?   Something to do with building an oil pipe so Europe aren't so dependent on Russia?

3635 2018-04-18 17:24:34 Meant to say “oil pipeline problems”
3636 2018-04-18 17:24:30 If they need financial help to build pipeline how would they cover expenses in the event of an oil spill?
3637 2018-04-18 17:24:14 Weakness: Hot, straight out of the oil visheti
3638 2018-04-18 17:24:14 “More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.” - Buhari

What a statement!
3639 2018-04-18 17:24:10 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
3640 2018-04-18 17:24:10 Petroleum is toxic and does result in NATURAL disasters when it's released in NATURAL ways.
Is it beneficial to the environment to remove the oil so it doesn't cause a natural disaster? Do humans cause more damage by removing oil & transporting oil?

3641 2018-04-18 17:24:07 I can see hydrogen being the next generation of fuel. But still oil will be a big part of plastics & synthetic manufacturing. The solar panels on this model are kind of silly since hydrogen cells generate shitloads of electricity.
3642 2018-04-18 17:24:06 why are fish oil pills so big??????
3643 2018-04-18 17:23:58 明日5時おき連絡いぇーい
3644 2018-04-18 17:23:54 Idk why people are asking me if I’m thinking of having a kid I can’t even get an oil change without procrastinating it till my car explodes so no thanks Karen, kids aren’t a thing rn

3646 2018-04-18 17:23:45 1. They either go there,  or stop,  crush the Dollar and Oil / inflation explodes in their face.  Even more.  
2.  Pension funds are dying on their fixed income exposure.
3647 2018-04-18 17:23:37 Allegra and Flonase! One my golf moms gave me RC essential oil... works good!
3648 2018-04-18 17:23:25 Top tip for any blonde girls out there who CONSTANTLY get mascara in their hair and never learn from their mistakes and tie it back - lil bit of coconut oil on your fingers, run it over the hair then wipe with a lil water on a cotton pad/face cloth  you’re welcome
3649 2018-04-18 17:23:18 Excuse us, it is an available industry which Alberta has tried to get to open market for years, perhaps you remember Keystone XL or Energy East.  Others than oil, food products (grain) and forestery are sold into an open market world wide.
3650 2018-04-18 17:22:41 น้องค่าๆ อันดับแรกที่มองหาคือนม นมใดนมนึง ถ้าทั้ง 2 ยิ่งดี คู่กะนมซังด้วย ถ้าเห็น 3 นมนี้จะสบายใตละ เฮียมีคนดูแลที่เป็นมากกว่าการทำตามหน้าที่ ดูแลเหมือนเปนพี่สาวพี่ชาย เหมือนคนในครอบครัวดูแลห่วงใยกัน รักนม เห็นนมเจองี้ เราก็เจ็บปวดใจไปด้วยเลยค่ะ
3651 2018-04-18 17:22:40 Heather, there nothing extremest about not supporting the intensification of tar sands harvesting. We need oil, we don’t need to intensify our use or extraction. What’s extreme is the NEB statements about “public interest” and those too blind to see they’re corruption
3652 2018-04-18 17:22:37 My grandmothers always rub oil and pray over my new dwellings anyway. I’ll be good

3654 2018-04-18 17:22:21 A rise in crude oil prices would translate into higher subsidy payments because the naira landing cost of petroleum products also increases proportionally.
3655 2018-04-18 17:22:15 Democracia era blanquear guita con hoteles, obras publica, quedarse con  retencion de impuestos consumidores de oil, llevar guita a los conventos, tener miles de propiedades, apoderarse de regalias petroleras, tener guita en seichele, matar a nisman,..
ESO ERA DEMOCRACIA!!
3656 2018-04-18 17:22:11 Hey @JustinTrudeau, voulez-vous vraiment vous inscrire dans l'histoire du monde comme étant #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
3657 2018-04-18 17:22:08 He kisses the back of her head, then lays his head behind hers, his nose buried in her hair. She smells of honeysuckle and gun oil. Feminine but strong. It’s what he admires about her, he thinks as he drifts off.
3658 2018-04-18 17:22:07 Maybe BC should restrict any and all shipments that are unloaded at the Port of Vancouver  that are destined for Alberta and Saskatchewan. Just leave the containers on the dock. Maybe Ms. NUTLEY will change her view on withholding gas and oil for our province.
3659 2018-04-18 17:21:55 Odio sentir esa sensación de culpa
3660 2018-04-18 17:21:53 Lmaoooo I remember when I used to drench my hair in wild growth hair oil
3661 2018-04-18 17:21:38 So, the tire thing is probably just low air due to cold weather or it could be a sensor. And then i feel ya on the oil
3662 2018-04-18 17:21:32 Here’s a theory: Russia is so massive and contains within its borders so many natural resources they could theoretically not give a shit about western sanctions and cut off the oil to Europe in the middle of winter.
3663 2018-04-18 17:21:26 They say it’s all soft tissue damage, I’m really thankful that I found CBD oil’s
3664 2018-04-18 17:21:23 thank you!!!! its my first time using oil paints
3665 2018-04-18 17:21:11 4 Iburpofen, Cbd oil, ice pack, weed...check. I suffered enough last night with my leg cramped up, was too cold to get up to take anything. Now im hoping the pain will at least numb for now. Pleasee send your healing vibes im tired of whining to chi chan like a lil bish
3666 2018-04-18 17:21:08 Maybe it is because people like Ford & Trump give them an excuse to blame someone else for their lives. Then sell them the false hope they are here too make it better, without every saying what they actually plan on doing that will hurt them even more. Snake oil salesmen.
3667 2018-04-18 17:21:06 15 years of war 3 million dead Vietnamese  A totally devastated country Still fighting to keep my car on the road  I guess the honey oil is what's happening ?
3668 2018-04-18 17:21:05 don't tell the american troops there's oil down there
3669 2018-04-18 17:20:58 Gee what are the chances that headcount dot org is funded by Soros?
3670 2018-04-18 17:20:56 And just how many acres of hemp should be grown to provide for the needs of a population?  What kind of equipment will you need to extract all the hemp oil needed to replace what we use now?    You do realize you need coal to produce high quality steel?
3671 2018-04-18 17:20:47 Still have yet to get my oil changed
3672 2018-04-18 17:20:41 For my birthday this year I want a good camera,an oil painting (my first art piece)&a MaXhosa dress. 

I should probably get a sugar daddy
3673 2018-04-18 17:20:37 The #guiltybyassociation measure is merely Big Oil’s clever bid to regain ground lost to the environmental movement. It would hit native communities and water protectors hardest. Tell #mnleg that’s not how MN works. #mnvalues, not corporate influence. @GovMarkDayton @EricLucerMN
3674 2018-04-18 17:20:32 The Shape of Oil.
3675 2018-04-18 17:20:25 Thank you! It’s from a while back. :) one of my first oil paintings actually ...
3676 2018-04-18 17:20:18 hate getting my oil change & the men up here talk me into buying a million new filters when really I just needed my oil change.....
3677 2018-04-18 17:20:14 In 1942, Mexico and the U.S. agree to value U.S. oil properties seized by Mexico in 1938 at $23,995,991.
3678 2018-04-18 17:20:07 Ban all knives, cars or planes too as accidents do happen with any technology ? The goal as such ought to REDUCE such risk given available technologies. 8B people got to eat. Disallow all tractor, combines, ships or trucks as they ALL use oil ? You are advocating mass starvation?
3679 2018-04-18 17:19:53 Yup, better find the gun oil
3680 2018-04-18 17:19:39 The EPA admin, Scott Pruitt, is actively reversing environmental protections put in place for us to have clean air and water, all for the sake of his wealthy donors, the oil companies.

3686 2018-04-18 17:18:39 How do I get an oil money allowance? I don’t want to maintain myself anymore
3687 2018-04-18 17:18:27 I like the urban decay one with Rosehip oil I can't remember what it's called, it's like light pink. It helps fill in pores and blur, and it also helps hydrate my dry as hek skin
3688 2018-04-18 17:18:15 The greens aren’t proposing to cut oil off completely... that’s what disinformation will get you. Rather, we are opposed to intensification!!!!!!! We should stop intensifying how much oil is used and is harvested. Your suggestion is not reflective of motives nor outcomes proposed
3689 2018-04-18 17:18:15 I say again animals are part of future of sustainable agriculture. Without animal products & byproducts - never mind meat we would need make even more use of oil &gas to generate plastics, artificial fibres & fertilisers which is not sustainable - even cotton isn't eco neutral
3690 2018-04-18 17:18:12 Of course people want that but they also drive, eat, use a bus or #BCFerries. They also buy bread, fruit or yoghurt which almost IN ITS ENTIRETY relies on oil. Where are all the #eTractors #eTrucks #eShips or #eCombines that power the food chain from farm to store, AT LOW COST ?

3692 2018-04-18 17:18:06 Cork has had more captains for man united who won stuff than Manchester has with man city I’d imagine. Look up Noel Cantwell. You might remember Roy Keane, who’s won as much as your club oil boy
3693 2018-04-18 17:18:02 my scalp be dry a hour after I oil it
3694 2018-04-18 17:17:59 1. This is a parody account
2. He’s talked about coconu  oil himself
3695 2018-04-18 17:17:56 The bill gives too much power to the executive, it's confiscatory, and seems the idea of a communist or a would be autocrat. Regarding Bahrain, that "massive oil reserve" has been overblown. It's an offshore tight rock reservoir, will have low recovery factor
3696 2018-04-18 17:17:53 How's that stay out of the oil patch call working out for ya Jim?

3708 2018-04-18 17:16:36 Simple, they invested way too heavily on 1 single industry. Mainly relying on Oil for money was stupid. This pipeline is being built SOLELY to supply oil to China but Horgan and Weaver are smart enough to know that this will contribute to make the planet worse for generations...
3709 2018-04-18 17:16:29 Is oil not a consideration too?
A pipeline through Syria to Israel so they can move the oil West with ease..?

Iran could be end-game given their swathes of oil.
3710 2018-04-18 17:16:18 Kept in the dark, then sliced apart and boiled in oil?

3714 2018-04-18 17:16:02 It was always a myth. #Oil in the 40s and even low 60s has led to a situation in which "lower for longer" will be words the market won't even remember were spoken.  No perfect supply/demand equilibrium exists; cyclical it was and shall remain!
3715 2018-04-18 17:15:59 
3716 2018-04-18 17:15:53 When heated it’s toxic. You’re better off using vegetable oil. Best oils to cook with are almond oil, rapeseed oil, hempseed and sesame oil.
3717 2018-04-18 17:15:53 How long has this man been running politics in Iowa?  He must be old enough to retire and let Iowans grow  'sweet corn' for consumption and less ethanol for the Oil corporations?
3718 2018-04-18 17:15:42 What a guy . How the minds of the gullible were easily manipulated by a Snake Oil Salesman back in the 1820s. Mmmm wait a minute wasn’t there another guy back in the 2016s ? Mmmm what’s his name .

3724 2018-04-18 17:15:05 Ang dami ko nilagay na efficascent oil. Ang sakit, maiiyak ka talaga sa sakit, bawal umiyak kasi mababasa lalong mas sasakit yung masakit
3725 2018-04-18 17:15:01 Today seemed like smoke & mirrors. BoC behaviour is not consistent with real time data: CPI above target, Cdn oil firming & strikes looming.

3728 2018-04-18 17:14:55 #Oil not shortable yet! Potential Fib. level extentions for a correction in WTI are at 72,14$ (127,2%) and 74,38$ (138,2%). I prefer the second one, cause it's the inverse golden Fib. Compare my tweet from 12 April.
3729 2018-04-18 17:14:42 LMAO jk I got my oil changed yesterday
3730 2018-04-18 17:14:31 If you heat your hone, drive a car, buy food in a grocery store, you pollute too. Wind is great, but oil extraction is a mature industry and the nation relies and will rely on oil for energy for many decades to come.
3731 2018-04-18 17:14:24 Yes hello swiming in lavender oil today
3732 2018-04-18 17:14:23 No that is false. Oil consumption is increasing and will so for many years. Intelligent action would be to follow Norway’s lead and maximize our resources and reinvest proceeds. Instead we are hurting ourselves and incurring record debt.
3733 2018-04-18 17:14:22 this girl just came in and bought $250 worth of oil painting stuff as a gift for her girlfriend i’m cry
3734 2018-04-18 17:14:18 Historically, the US government becoming aware of the presence of oil in a given location tends to go very, very poorly for the people who live there.
3735 2018-04-18 17:14:08 *Wouldn't be a disaster. Libya had $150 billion in reserves,had 143 tons of gold, similar amount of silver and was going to threaten the petrodollar by creating the African dinar to be used for oil sales in Africa and the ME. Libyans publicly owned the oil.Housing a human right.
3736 2018-04-18 17:14:07 What man wants a woman proposing to him? What would be the point? Should she change the oil too? Get him pregnant? When does it stop? Lol!

3738 2018-04-18 17:13:59 Since he was voted in partly on this issue PMJT will lose a large number of votes next time around. His legacy could've been clean energy with jobs galore.

3742 2018-04-18 17:13:08 Believe it or not, it wasn’t about oil or reconstruction either. It was done to make sure we enslave ourselves and guarantee a future with the classic American ideals of liberty and a right to privacy.

3748 2018-04-18 17:12:42 Scott Pruitt is collecting paychecks or promises of payment to deregulate EPA laws from Oil, Chemical & Mining companies. What's so hard to understand about that? His Paranoia about his personal safety relates to his actions as an active agent of "Polluting for Profit."
3749 2018-04-18 17:12:40 It feel like I get my oil changed every 3 weeks
3750 2018-04-18 17:12:37 Now I know that I'll start to use it for everything too. This oil is fantastic! *__*
3751 2018-04-18 17:12:26 Just did my first ever "oil pull" !!
3752 2018-04-18 17:12:19 If anyone is trading GUSH/DRIP if you read the news on crude oil supply is way down and expected to continue to decrease which will raise the price of oil.  What’s currently happening in the Middle East is affecting oil prices. Just something to think about
3753 2018-04-18 17:12:19 Its amazing how many people drive but cant change their oil brakes and tires....dont even get me started on knowing when to change shit
3754 2018-04-18 17:12:13 Let's sell the strategic oil reserve to Cuba. Either that, or put it on eBay
3755 2018-04-18 17:12:03 Flames!??  Pfft!  Oil all the way!  ....except this year.  Definitely wasn't all the way this year.  But it will happen!  Top notch fellows for sure.
3756 2018-04-18 17:11:56 And tons of mustache oil
3757 2018-04-18 17:11:54 Oil prices would probably send shocks throughout our economy

All the students: “...that was like a decade before we were born.”
Prof: “Oh.”

3759 2018-04-18 17:11:50 Experiment already tried. That's basically why Starbucks formally dis-invited gun carriers: some jerks started unduly flaunting armament, talking loudly about it, and otherwise deliberately annoying/scaring the regular customers.
3760 2018-04-18 17:11:49 It's also a question of economics. Saudis want a pipeline to Europe via Syria to compete with Russia's pipeline. This is why Russia props up Assad to oppose this pipeline. EU want cheaper oil/gas. Trump, as with Clintons, is now owned by Saudis. Follow the money.
3761 2018-04-18 17:11:39 Acquire a chicken, a lemon, and an onion; cut lemon and onion into quarters, stick rosemary, lemon, and whatever onion fits into the cavity; roast. 

Alternately, get garlic and potatoes; cut potatoes into 1 inch cubes-ish; toss with oil, minced rosemary and garlic; roast.
3762 2018-04-18 17:11:13 I need some coconut oil for my beard who buying it
3763 2018-04-18 17:11:09 Also check the tires, no side bubbles, ask when the last time someone did an oil change and the last time the brakes are done and if you can check to see if the e brake works properly if it doesn’t then that’s usually a bad sign the car wasn’t taken care of properly
3764 2018-04-18 17:11:08 Have a smokin deal on a LS 5.3 truck motor,   Rebuilt with new hot cam, injectors, intake, oil pan, harmonic Balancer $1500

3773 2018-04-18 17:10:05 The latest development in stalled Trans Mountain pipeline project: The B.C. government says it will sue Alberta if the province moves forward with legislation restricting oil that will drive up oil costs & potentially pressuring B.C. to reverse objections to pipeline expansion.
3774 2018-04-18 17:09:57 I’ve been using peppermint oil instead of poppin Advils and such. Let me tell you...that is a DEEP ASS SLEEP. I stay waking up disoriented
3775 2018-04-18 17:09:49 I use coconut oil for everything! And it’s a great moisturizer too 
3776 2018-04-18 17:09:48 I would like to try SkinFX cleansing oil wash and a new mascara.
3777 2018-04-18 17:09:48 I’d be asking why a 2012 is going for 1500, check the rockers, frame, engine mounts, exhaust, any accidents on the car if it was repaired, check the oil see if there’s any metal shavings AND open the antifreeze reservoir and see if there’s any oil in that
3778 2018-04-18 17:09:46 Give the Spanish land grant owners their oil money, it's theirs, not the states.
3779 2018-04-18 17:09:45 How much of Alberta oil money is going into that ??
3780 2018-04-18 17:09:44 coming soon our own Salt Pig Branded branded 100ml bottles @great_oil can`t wait meantime we have the bottles for sale unbranded
3781 2018-04-18 17:09:39 I have no issue with wind, it's great. But until we put sails on all our cars, we "import" all of our oil/gas. Stands to reason we should take some of the risk in producing that oil. If every state refused to participate in oil production we'd all still be on horeseback.
3782 2018-04-18 17:09:33 before u try to write that off as a gross generalization in ur head, educate yourself on the gold rush and early history of oil drilling in California. Ur defending men (and their, still wealthy, descendants) who   profited from backbreaking work of miners at the cost of nature

3791 2018-04-18 17:08:31 I need to do a hand scrub using olive oil and sugar.  My skin is so dry, and as I don't wear gloves when dyeing (I know, I know!!) dye gets into the cracks and my hands are permanently stained. An olive oil/sugar scrub works wonders.
3792 2018-04-18 17:08:26 I’ve realized this myself when I painted with oil for the first time but to me that’s not enough for the current hierarchy to exist

3794 2018-04-18 17:08:17 @PepsiCo  - gotta let go of that Palm Oil travesty and loophole.  Please do the right thing, for every good reason.
3795 2018-04-18 17:08:15 We're talking about KM and not Embridge. Their existing pipeline hasn't leaked at all. Not only that, everything has a risk. Would you like to transport the oil via rail or truck? That's even more dangerous, statistically. You're also ignoring BC is also building natgas lines.
3796 2018-04-18 17:08:05 Grilled chicken with olive oil IS NOT ANYWHERE near as savory as Steak despite similar macros
3797 2018-04-18 17:08:03 Solar is cheaper than oil.  More people work in bowling alleys than in coal mines.  Climate change is shrinking our snow pack and endangering our agriculture.  We’re lucky other states are pitching in.
3798 2018-04-18 17:08:02 In Nigeria digital is gradually evolving. But a bank that can go  digital right now will will be the oil well of banking in the very close future. Digital is the new face of the world economy.

3800 2018-04-18 17:07:49 Took me ages to realise that the little lingette thingy they put with wax strips for hair removal is just paper with oil and that any old cooking oil would do the trick too. Would have made a great scientist. Not.

3805 2018-04-18 17:07:12 Dude get your head out of your ass. This is solely about selling oil to China because they want the money. This would never have been an issue had they invested more in other industries. Rule numero Uno about investments, DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN THE SAME BASKET
3806 2018-04-18 17:06:52 We need oil, just not Canadian oil. Because Canadian oil is bad for the environment. Sarc.

3810 2018-04-18 17:06:15 Maybe bc oil companies know prices at the pump will go down if we have too much oil on the market.

3814 2018-04-18 17:06:02 It's great in my opinion. I've been using CBD oil for the past 6 years and never went above 3% for my chronic pain problem. And it works as fuck for me :)

3819 2018-04-18 17:05:35 When oil was $30 a barrel,  Scotland in Union share was $11 per barrel. So when Scotland is independent and the price drops to $30 again we will get more than double than we got as part of the Union. Who says we won't be better off ?

3863 2018-04-18 17:01:25 I think it’s due to the texture of the paints vs the flatness of pencils. Personally experimenting with oil paints, there’s an added level of dimension which contributes to the physical/visual feel of the art but I agree with you. There shouldn’t be a hierarchy between mediums

3871 2018-04-18 17:00:44 Short-term, the Trans-Mountain approval should be honored. But AK/SK may need to commit to greater risk mitigation $ and set aside a portion of O&G proceeds towards clean energy development and oil sands environmental mitigation.
3872 2018-04-18 17:00:40 Why the future?  You could have all of that right now.  Just stop using oil and all related products. I support a transition to low/non carbon economies, but the key word is **transition**  If you slow/stop Canada's economic engine you will see MORE NeoCons elected, not less.

When planning to get an oil change, people always look for a cheaper option thinking it doesn’t make much difference.

3890 2018-04-18 17:00:11 awful when I just want to go to the bathroom in peace but everyone is aggressively showing off their genitalia and they force me to judge them in a beauty contest and then I have to touch them all and then they start passing around the baby oil
3891 2018-04-18 17:00:05 I have been known to use ordinary olive oil too - it's an excellent cleanser and moisturiser too, and is brilliant for a pre-shampoo deep-conditioning treatment. But you do smell a bit like a salad. BioOil does smell nice.
3892 2018-04-18 17:00:03 Sounds like the proverbial oil tanker. Wouldn’t PR result in very similar outcomes?

3898 2018-04-18 16:59:27 Josh claims he was making the teas, on a moving bus which is hard, and he saw a wooden coffee stirrer towards that back of the kitchen worktop (probably hidden behind stuff) so he used it to stir the teas. Obviously it was a diffuser and the oil from the diffuser went in the tea!

3900 2018-04-18 16:59:14 The obvious is that Alberta governments have been idiots by focusing so heavily on one single industry. You guys shot yourselves in the foot and now you're paying the price. The environment is what matters, not the money hungry oil companies. #getyourshittogether
3901 2018-04-18 16:59:11 Fuck I hate caster oil
3902 2018-04-18 16:59:07 For real. 

Eg: a typical meal for 2... meat will be around R40. Veggies R40... you gonna need spices, cooking oil, maize or rice..... 
It cost around R150 for a typical nice meal. Pizza is R100. Burger is R40. 
Catch the drift?

3908 2018-04-18 16:58:29 @dominos_india there is a video circulating on social media that Dominos use oil mayonnaise instead of cheese. Is this true? The person in the video claims to have worked with Dominos.
3909 2018-04-18 16:58:23 Oil rises two percent as Saudi Arabia aims at $100/bbl, U.S. stockpiles fall.. that's Reuters. But will greedy producers let it stay?? #oil #saudi #iran

3911 2018-04-18 16:58:19 It doesn’t stop it from being really annoying tho. A lot of people have gone to school and can’t find jobs. He’ll do anything to deflect the blame from himself. Meanwhile he doesn’t have an SSCE  result but he’s rich from Nigeria’s oil. 
Very ironical

3922 2018-04-18 16:57:28 @Nidhi Ma'am, In response to an RTI filed last year I have learnt that India's largest state owned oil marketing company still does not have any norms in place for posting competent Quality Control Personnel at sensitive storage locations spread across the country

3924 2018-04-18 16:56:50 You mean Halloumi mate. Have you ever tried to grill Feta? As it happens if you marinate skewers of Halloumi, red onion, peppers and mushrooms in oil/lemon juice/fresh herbs then BBQ them, even carnivores generally will approve.

3931 2018-04-18 16:56:14 Protest is a tribute to oil ... Heavy trucks w/ crane to deliver/pickup the concrete, and pipe. Signage and banners, petroleum based and one-time use, so straight to landfill the next day... hypocrites and typical.
3932 2018-04-18 16:56:00 Appears we're advancing down a double positive path for oil prices. Any #NorthKorea agreement is bullish for demand while a non-fix with #Iran threatens supplies. #Venezuela, #USD and #OPEC agreement are all gravy.

Water won't flow through the water brushes too.

3942 2018-04-18 16:55:09 Do I have this right?
The oil sands sector, including oil sands in situ extraction, mining & upgrading, associated cogeneration facilities, reported the largest share of 2013 GHG in Alberta, emitting 44.1 per cent of total reported emissions but pay 0 carbon tax #cdnpoli

3946 2018-04-18 16:54:58 It is a flocculation-flotation system that uses #reclaimed alum as a coagulant and dissolved air flotation to remove solids and oil and grease. In essence, we are using waste to treat #waste.
3947 2018-04-18 16:54:52 Like use a bike, any massive transport mean instead of your car. The less we depend on these kind of industries the better. They need subsidies because oil extraction is extremely expensive and risky and they need government support.
3948 2018-04-18 16:54:49 Yes. You can deliver demon and gst, higher petrol prices, lower growth when oil prices were at damn low.
3949 2018-04-18 16:54:47 I can pop round with me baby oil 
3950 2018-04-18 16:54:41 I really hope someone like @prowrestlingts does a new series of Andre shirts based on the Andre the Giant documentary on @hbo. Imagine a cartoon of a giant Andre hand pointing at a scared Macho Man with the caption "Baby oil, get out!" I'd buy it.
3951 2018-04-18 16:54:38 Trump im saudi Arabia...how  to buy the Republican Party while u put sanctions on Venezuela and Russia oil and you don't let Libya pump any oil

3960 2018-04-18 16:54:03 So. Trying out this CBD oil. 

Feeeeeeeeling pretty good so far. 

It's not a noticeable difference, but you notice that your body is more prone to relax & your brain doesn't focus on bad things. 

So yay. Expensive, but yay.

3967 2018-04-18 16:53:19 According to @oilfractals, oil inventory in the US is UP since the beginning of the year, refinery runs are down on high gasoline inventory.  All this when exports are up, beating imports by 400k/day.  And WTI is up 10%, how lovely those fundies back it up surely....

3975 2018-04-18 16:52:22 Oil, mate - and pipelines involved too.
3976 2018-04-18 16:52:11 The first phrase is the problem, free market doesn’t work well. Find a better argument to support the end of subsidizing oil companies, I know there are stronger arguments.

3979 2018-04-18 16:52:05 as if you really care about that nation, if not for the oil they have.  why not say the same to Zimbabwe for their colonialism independence  anniversary today, simple, they don't have oil to spill plus that country is from a sh!thole continent
3980 2018-04-18 16:52:02 sometimes doing the right thing doesn't involve getting paid for it - a difficult concept to grasp for oil shills such as yourself

3990 2018-04-18 16:51:21 Please tell me how CBD oil is going to make you want to “go back” to your hard shit drugs, especially when it doesn’t even get you high????
3991 2018-04-18 16:51:16 If you were a real feminist you wouldn't have more respect for oil companies than you do for Mother Earth.

3996 2018-04-18 16:50:43 Over N5trillion in revenue and budget is N8.6trillion. If you add oil revenue for 2.7million barrels @ average of $60 dollars per barrel then total revenue is more than N20trillion. If na so, why borrow  N11trillion in 2yrs. If una dey lie, make una dey borrow sense.

4021 2018-04-18 16:48:21 One protection is that much of the oil industry in western Canada is American owned. So, our southern neighbours get benefit from Canadian corporate welfare. Trumpsters don't complain when wealth transfers are from ordinary taxpayers to wealthy investors. #cdnpoli #abpoli
4022 2018-04-18 16:47:55 Dear PM @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines
4023 2018-04-18 16:47:29 #JusticeForMarthaWanjiku...it is very backward and naive to slap another person more so a woman as an exercise of power. The fact there are some programmed robots shouting mheshimiwa in the assault makes it nauseating!

4030 2018-04-18 16:47:10 @AJWVictoriaBC I'm strongly pro environment but I am curious about what alternatives there are for boosting the economy without oil money, which I assume is why Trudeau is all about the pipeline? Pragmatism? I'd love to be educated on our other realistic options!
4031 2018-04-18 16:47:06 With Saudis wanting $100 oil I can’t see this lasting much longer if that hold true.
4032 2018-04-18 16:47:03 @jiffylube
Boss: I want you to think of a way to bring in more business.

Me: I could lay in the street, when someone stops to see if I'm okay, I ask them if they need an oil change.

Boss: You are no longer allowed to talk to customers.
4033 2018-04-18 16:46:56 #standwith red when Red is just as bad with drilling for oil in our nations coastlines ruining the fishing industry and beaches. Throw the whole account away with the post.
4034 2018-04-18 16:46:41 "Drilling for truth", with a zipper going through any borders, selling information to the highest (American) bidder. Facebook is a Judas machine, created around the same axiom as the "drilling for oil" was in the 20th Century ...

Putin should completely illegalize it ...
4035 2018-04-18 16:46:40 First time I saw someone lose because of truffle oil, it made me realize just how classist cooking competition shows can be. This contestant had never eaten at the kind of expensive restaurant she was being asked to emulate.
4036 2018-04-18 16:46:39 @smart_MS3 So sorry to hear of your mom’s cancer. Please consider cannabis oil as part of her treatment. The THC has proven very effective in slowing / killing cancer cells. Prayers to u and ur family.  
4037 2018-04-18 16:46:27 Well, his paternal grandfather did own an oil products company.
4038 2018-04-18 16:46:12 On a personal note, I don't react acutely to olive oil that I can observe, but coconut oil causes my face to flush. 4/4

4040 2018-04-18 16:46:07 I use Vaseline lotion on my face. Oil of Olay makes my skin too oily. Mitch what's your regime?
4041 2018-04-18 16:45:56 Can’t forget the essential oil diffuser
4042 2018-04-18 16:45:53 Are we talking about SOMA & OIL or are we talking about Berbera DP project?
4043 2018-04-18 16:45:51 Nap then shower with tea tree oil perhaps
4044 2018-04-18 16:45:46 Since I've been growing out my beard I thought it finally time I give beard oil a go and honestly I don't know why I didn't sooner, it's made my fuzz so wonderfully soft, has a pleasant scent and helps with post shower grooming (though this one could be better on that front).
4045 2018-04-18 16:45:46 Esta definición de Deuda que ubica el FMI en reciente reporte es consistente con informe de Contraloría: "The IMF’s definition of debt includes advanced oil sales, treasury certificates, central bank loans, and domestic arrears that are excluded from the official debt definition"

4047 2018-04-18 16:45:39 I disagree with that completely. I can tell you I use cannabis oil for pain and sleep and my cognitive values increase not decrease.
4048 2018-04-18 16:45:32 BRB, just had an idea relating to my car's oil leak
4049 2018-04-18 16:45:27 Oh, oki. Just take a breather, look at some cats n stuff I guess. No point in making the trip if your engine needs oil, I reckon
4050 2018-04-18 16:45:26 Check your Engine oil this morning.

4052 2018-04-18 16:45:15 Oh most definitely, Angus dear. I'm still trying to finish my special painting of you and Samson to add to the book. I wanted oil paint  but mean old Granny only let me use watercolour .She says it will wash off my paws more easily....
4053 2018-04-18 16:45:08 Tip: When you're next at the supermarket get some coconut flour, coconut oil and Almond flour - these are great to have in your cupboard to make Keto friendly breads and cakes!
4054 2018-04-18 16:44:58 That’s some serious snake oil, another murphy up to no good.

4055 2018-04-18 16:44:55 According to the IMF, the Nigeria's economy which grew by 0.8 per cent in 2017 will end this year with a 2.1 per cent growth. It, however, projected a slow down to 1.9 per cent growth next year and urge Nigeria being an oil- dependant economy to intensify economic diversification
4056 2018-04-18 16:44:40 Very backward and naive. The fact there are some programmed robots shouting mheshimiwa makes it nauseating!
4057 2018-04-18 16:44:24 There's no "tar". That term was once used because of the consistency. Like it or not, we are still dependent on oil. Would you rather it come from countries w/no environmental standards? Or Canada, with the highest standards & accountability in the world?
4058 2018-04-18 16:44:23 Before this summer comes (whenever that is) I need a yellow fit and body oil. That’s it!
4059 2018-04-18 16:44:08 Face oil pun boleh buat makeup remover, macam olive oil, argan oil etc. Functionnya sama macam makeup remover or baby oil di market. U cleanse bersih2 ke lepas pakai that oil?

4080 2018-04-18 16:42:08 fancy @Strath_FAI forgetting to mention if the Export stats include oil and gas and which statiscal account provides the categorical assertion of £46 Billion exports to England when no official figures are available because they are not collected.

4082 2018-04-18 16:41:39 No Amtrak steak for me sadly, Matt. Lunch only today. Grits? Best avoided under any circumstances. Just enjoying Amtrak coffee at the moment; an exotic blend of Robusta beans, trackside roadkill, sump oil and brake fluid, strained through the engineers socks
4083 2018-04-18 16:41:34 That is the saddest thing about people like him and Glen Beck.  They are very successful snake oil salesmen while their country is being poisoned by them.
4084 2018-04-18 16:41:22 There’s a pattern in the false flags and lies:
- #MH17 
- The Sochi doping scandal 
- The #Skripals 
- The #DoumaMassacre

The goal is preparing the public for 
- Economic or even real warfare on Russia
 - Destruction, sunnification of Syria
- Saving the American oil/LNG industry

4144 2018-04-18 16:35:45 For years we have protected Arab oil as a part of our national security.  I think Trump is convincing them that he's serious about them doing their part to protect their own national security cuz we gonna be outta there.

4146 2018-04-18 16:35:35 Back in the 1980s the oil spill in Alaska and also in 2010 didn’t make me boycott Exxon Mobile or BP, it was just accidents.
4147 2018-04-18 16:35:34 That’s odd. I thought they responded to 35,000 job losses and massive oil downturn  by putting up everyone’s taxes and business rates. Why anyone in Aberdeen votes SNP is beyond me.

4154 2018-04-18 16:34:58 I don’t think people understand just how much work goes into natural hair. Jut from doing two deep condition cessions ( one a DIY), a hot oil treatment, and the actual regular shampoo/condition I’ve wracked up about 6 hours do work. AND I HAVENT EVEN STYLED IT YET 
4155 2018-04-18 16:34:52 omfish ponies made a coconut oil, lemon juice, and be glare/scratch resistant and I dont want them to tint when I go outside
4156 2018-04-18 16:34:50 So much for the oil companies BS about supply and demand. We have had a glut and gas prices gave been steadily climbing for weeks.
4157 2018-04-18 16:34:48 Not to mention that both Blackrock and Vanguard have offered socially responsible funds for people who don’t want exposure to tobacco, weapons, alcohol, or oil.
4158 2018-04-18 16:34:46 As economy picks up and oil is not super low, Indian current account deficit expands. This is natural as Indian exports don’t grow enough. So you can’t artificially inflate economy without decline in INR.
4159 2018-04-18 16:34:30 Anyone else ever think about the time they had to tell their dad that oil is a non-renewable resource and that it will eventually run out?
4160 2018-04-18 16:34:29 My favorite is spaghetti (usually just with a bit of olive oil and Parmesan), mostly because I got used to preparing it for myself but also because it is objectively the best and makes a million leftovers.

4162 2018-04-18 16:34:19 Our currency is the petrodollar, backed by oil. Your proposal is not possible.
4163 2018-04-18 16:34:14 "Avec le mix énergétique chinois, une Tesla émet davantage de CO2 qu'une bonne vieille voiture à essence, en calculant «  du puits à la roue  » (avec le gaz émis avant que l'énergie n'arrive à la voiture)." Source?

4170 2018-04-18 16:33:47 So lets pour more of our money in a rat hole.We need to fix our roads and feed our people.Use their oil and let the other countrys use their money.What does Russia get...nothing
4171 2018-04-18 16:33:20 You mean the ambassador he picked and was confirmed by a Republican Congress? Goes right along with all of the other inept appointments he’s made and subsequent departures only to appoint more inept people. But at least you voted for him and bought his snake oil.
4172 2018-04-18 16:33:19 I Dont Care If You Got PepBoys Money If You Font Know How to Change a Tire or Oil You SAD 
4173 2018-04-18 16:33:18 i dropped off my car to get an oil change, my sister was suppose to pick me up and instead an uber showed up 
4174 2018-04-18 16:33:10 According to Natural Resources Defense Council's Canada, our largest source of climate pollution is tar sands oil development. Environmental scientists are in agreement. This is not a debate.
4175 2018-04-18 16:33:03 That is some TEA on widow and I love her . She called him buckle I'm deceased .  poor guy was in the wrong place at the wrong time w/o a cyanide tooth precaution. I for one am living for the oil sheen blowout #buckybarnesprotectionsqaud
4176 2018-04-18 16:33:02 Alberta must stop the oil to BC and start severing all economic ties to Canada. Then we must build pipelines to US and ship grain thru US. Canada is a parasite destroying our future.
4177 2018-04-18 16:32:58 Exactly so I do not see the reason for oil prices to go up especially if Aramco or entire OPEC does not want to reduce production. The only way is to reach it via poor dollar
4178 2018-04-18 16:32:44 #BharatKiBaatSabkeSaath what is @narendramodi doing for controlling the #DigitalIndia now while #CashCrunchOrNot. Why there is #Dange everywhere. Why oil prices highest in India. Why ministries are not giving up for #subsidies
4179 2018-04-18 16:32:44 Oh you mean do I think that we should end the oil Wars and probably move to a European Healthcare System...

I mean...yes? We should do those things and not do the war and people dying things.
4180 2018-04-18 16:32:43 Hell yes let’s do it I miss doing some cool oil stuff I know it’s a hike but we could do it on the beach by our place or wherever doe
4181 2018-04-18 16:32:42 Canada is missing the boat big time with the regulation of Hemp derived CBD oil. I saw some on sale in supermarkets in Florida. 
Why is this illegal in Canada? It is illegal because of ignorance and improper classification by Health Canada.

4185 2018-04-18 16:32:29 I was right about the tarrifs on steel and Oil.

4217 2018-04-18 16:29:49 that argument makes about as much sense as BC govt blocking pipeline for environment reasons, yet will bring Alberta to court to force them to deliver gas and oil it needs. Canada / Ontario need thriving business just as BC needs its oil in order to prosper.

4221 2018-04-18 16:29:17 I thought occurred to me as I was reading a tweet from Sheldon Whitehouse. Big oil money creates the Republican agenda. What if clean energy and billionaires like Tom Steyer bought out the Republican Party? Money buys the Republicans. What if we outbid the Kochs?
4222 2018-04-18 16:29:14 Very good and true... Don't forget POTUS also opened ANWAR and other oil rich area's in the USA... Just a thought

4235 2018-04-18 16:28:02 Vc acha que foi a demanda q fez o oil triplicar nos últimos 2 anos? Pq só poderia, dado q o output no mundo aumento muito (US batendo recorde de produção).

But coal is, just like oil & natural gas, a gift from God to mankind that should be employed wisely & for milleniums to come. Burning it is threatening the future!

4252 2018-04-18 16:26:25 I'm kind of torn on this whole issue.  The world is not ready t o be without oil, so bringing ours to market is important.  Accidents like Lac Megantique (sp?) tells us that truck and rail are worse options than pipeline.  Maybe we need the pipeline?

4264 2018-04-18 16:25:18 I wonder if anyone has ever told @sunrickbell that the oil sands wouldn't exist without the massive government investment he's now decrying?
4265 2018-04-18 16:25:13 I get what you’re saying. After 30+ years in an oil refinery my husband also has hearing issues and now has hearing aides. Like you he doesn’t wear them all the time. It is frustrating to have to yell at him sometimes but at the end of the day it’s a minor issue.

4271 2018-04-18 16:24:27 Yes, USD collapsed against oil from 2003-2008, w/oil going from $20 to $150 in that time.  That's been a disaster for the US...except for the whole shale revolution, massive job growth, energy independence, cheaper fuels...don't sell the US so short.

4273 2018-04-18 16:24:23 So it is about you maintaining your affordable status quo.  That is the exact response one might expect from a government employee that never actually had to make money at their work but always got paid.  Asia will buy oil from someone but since you do not see a benifit its bad?
4274 2018-04-18 16:24:17 You’ve got to hand it to this snake-oil-salesman. Trump just keeps repeating the same old lies and his lemmings keep following him off the cliff of our country. He’s today’s Pied Piper.

4287 2018-04-18 16:23:28 @MBuhari piqued citizens depending on oil money are lazy.If depending on oil money is an act of laziness,heads of our 3 tiers of authorities are the laziest Nigerian b/cos they also depend & will ever depend on oil to run their affairs.
4288 2018-04-18 16:23:20 It’s evidence of the POWER OF OIL in our country!
4289 2018-04-18 16:23:19 @vincestaples is the GOAT. dropping R Kelly's name in an interview where he talks about bombing oil refineries, knowing what the media will choose to blow up. Lucky to witness his transition into the mainstream.

4292 2018-04-18 16:23:01 We get asked a lot about the advantages of our Synthetic Blend Oil. Read more about why this oil is a better option.
4293 2018-04-18 16:23:00 Call us today to schedule your oil change.
4294 2018-04-18 16:22:58 hair with no oil is so boring ... hahahah
4295 2018-04-18 16:22:56 BTW, CRT staff recently told me that when CRT changed from grease to the new oil the staff spent hours cleaning the grease of the paddle gear to replace it with oil. What a waste of money! Any reasonable management would have waited until the grease wear off before oiling.

4305 2018-04-18 16:22:22 I would suggest buying a fresh one. Steaming or boiling it for about 45minutes-1hour. Let it cool. Cut in half. Scrape out the thistles on the inside. Drizzle with olive oil and some granulated garlic and a pinch of salt. Then bake in the oven at 375 for about 15-20 minutes.
4306 2018-04-18 16:22:20 I would like some marijuana aswell, But have to go to Amsterdam to get it legally. Would you smoke it or take pills? Smoking still affects the lungs apparently. Im gonna order some cbd oil until then.

4310 2018-04-18 16:22:08 Oil, WTI, is getting up to $70. I think it's going to $80 this year. Tech in oil&gas gives more ROI from price.
Canadian oil producers will keep collecting pennies on the dollar without access to market. The Canadian dollar isn't moving because of lack of foreign investment.
4311 2018-04-18 16:22:08 Why didn't you cover the death of Ralph Stanley, the grandfather of bluegrass? He diid NOT kill half a million people in an illegal war to privatize oil for personal profit.

4313 2018-04-18 16:21:51 In not so shocking news. Jimbo is continuing to KILL on the trail. #7 DT commit. And now he has SEC and oil money 
4314 2018-04-18 16:21:50 It is the truth that you can't answer back to. Saudi Arabia sneaks a comment about 80-100 oil, and you think you've found the equation of everything.
4315 2018-04-18 16:21:49 @Gidi_Traffic “More than 60 percent of Nigerian population is below 30, a lot of them  haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil  producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get  housing, healthcare,education free”-President Buhari
4316 2018-04-18 16:21:40 It's funny how these oil haters don't mind flying on the publics dime, unless they are using solar powered planes.
4317 2018-04-18 16:21:26 @307_alicia That's no good! What's your favorite kind of essential oil?

4324 2018-04-18 16:20:40 Looks like it will hit 75 before OPEC/ Russia meeting on Friday. Saudi has stated that they’re eying 80$ oil. They need it for Aramco IPO @Ch2Christo
4325 2018-04-18 16:20:38 I just bought some body oil so I can try to make that homemade body lava shit. Hopefully this shit turns out right cause a bitch is trying to burn everyone’s eyes from all this glow
4326 2018-04-18 16:20:22 Who got some oil??. Dm real quick. I'm trying see sum.
4327 2018-04-18 16:20:17 $25 for a 15ml bottle of oil is ridiculous. But guess who still bought it 
4328 2018-04-18 16:20:14 In Virginia any physician can prescribe CBD or THC-A oil to treat any diagnosed condition or disease.   Bill passes both houses of state legislature unanimously.
4329 2018-04-18 16:20:14 I love rubbing coconut oil in my beard and on my body in the morning. I smell like a goddamn SNACK!

4334 2018-04-18 16:19:34 They only vote for the bills they have been paid to vote for by their masters. If big oil or the pharmaceutical companies have no skin in the game they stay neutral and are not interested! Cynical? Sure but what other reason can there be?

4336 2018-04-18 16:19:28 The fact that people will post about baby oil saying "contains no chemicals!!" is both a failure of education and a triumph of marketing.
4337 2018-04-18 16:19:27 exit crude oil 67.81 1/2 assets
4338 2018-04-18 16:19:24 Well if USA produce more oil then Saudi Arabia, where this oil is, is it evaporating?
4339 2018-04-18 16:19:23 Stop supporting the oil sands and start living up to your promises on climate change -  We trusted you!
4340 2018-04-18 16:19:22 Well, Assad gave Prigozhin's oil company the rights to the field sometime back. He couldn't monetize the asset 'cos it was held by opposing forces. It was a major attack; armor, artillery, maybe half a battalion. Can't imagine Putin didn't OK it first. Kremlin rules, OK?
4341 2018-04-18 16:19:14 $mro and yet worst performing oil stk today. i guess when I sell it will break out like $fang did. UGH UGH

4349 2018-04-18 16:18:32 Did you read my tweet well?
I never said that he didn't have a point, matter of fact I said he was making sense.

I said he ruined it by comparing Nigeria to a fictional community.

Beside is Nigeria the only country with crude oil, are we the country with the most crude oil??
4350 2018-04-18 16:18:28 I am still confused, if the source of the CBD oil is industrial hemp, is it not legal? 
Hemp derivatives with less than 10 micrograms of THC would fall outside the required licensing for industrial hemp as per section Industrial hemp 2.2.4
4351 2018-04-18 16:18:28 I make a mix of brown sugar, honey, lemon, and olive oil. Lmk if you want the recipe :).
4352 2018-04-18 16:18:25 The attempted deification of Barbara Bush is setting my teeth on edge. She was less saint than enabler. Her family is responsible for two wars over oil. She personally was as anti-progressive AF. Spare me the retcon of her "service to the country."

4356 2018-04-18 16:18:06 The #guiltybyassociation measure is merely Big Oil’s clever bid to regain ground lost to the environmental movement.

4358 2018-04-18 16:18:02 Can't remember - we did 26 locks yesterday. All I know is that gate paddles were all unusually stiff and that the oil that CRT uses now is useless as a lubricant for smooth paddle gear operation (and it washes off when it rains).

4361 2018-04-18 16:17:47 I can see it all being built from my window. An oil pipeline also runs at the end of my street near my drinking water supply and right by my daughters school. I support this project.
4362 2018-04-18 16:17:43 Lol... where’s this coconut oil and why do you travel with it?
4363 2018-04-18 16:17:41 three scoops vanilla ice cream, drizzle a couple glugs of olive oil and sprinkle a pinch of salt. once you try it, i'm sure you will like it and then you can alter the ratios to your liking. it's my fav thing 
4364 2018-04-18 16:17:40 If people weren't buying so many oil derived plastics for example safety helmets, there wouldnt be the demand for pipelines
4365 2018-04-18 16:17:16 Well. Can you explain to me why we’re exporting gas for the first time in ages and yet our gas prices are still well over $2 — and that’s for CORN gas not oil gas. Oil gas costs over $3 a gallon. Gov has to get the hell out of our markets so we can let true capitalism work.
4366 2018-04-18 16:17:12 We're standing on the edge of Western civilization, drunk on capitalism and crude oil grudge-fracked out of the ground by glorified robber barons angry their era is dying.

4378 2018-04-18 16:15:44 In short-term, they bet on rebound in crude oil, lumber, agricultural because temporary factors (p.8). I think capacity pressures matter more for the number of rate hikes (2 or 1) than the timing (May, July or October)

4386 2018-04-18 16:15:08 Views on $OIL now that it has breached the 68.00 mark? Technically a correction to ~ 64.75 level is still likely however this could be scuttled by geopolitical happenings

4406 2018-04-18 16:13:47 Thanks for this informative and illuminating article. I only wish you'd thought it relevant to mention Golan's vast oil reserves and the obviously related involvement of US neo-cons connected to Genie oil...   Without this, the larger picture is fatally obscured.
4407 2018-04-18 16:13:39 If the states win their suit, who pays the bill? How about everyone who buys gas, turns on their lights, heats their homes or steps on a plane to take a vacation. We will all pay for this lunacy and the oil companies will still be making profits. Thank you very much.
4408 2018-04-18 16:13:37 Eh ke oil ya? Wkwkw
4409 2018-04-18 16:13:31 try something different. ar use pure coconut oil or olive oil.

4412 2018-04-18 16:13:14 If we became an exporter of oil in 2011, why are always seeing gasoline prices increase because of upticks in oil barrel prices in Middle East?

4414 2018-04-18 16:13:04 As the costs of climate disasters / adaptation mount, the pressure on govts to go after oil & coal companies with tobacco-style lawsuits will grow. And the more their associations support GHG regulatory rollbacks, the more vulnerable they will be.

4416 2018-04-18 16:12:54 Don Abrams scared me recently by saying he has seen cancer patients drop out of chemotherapy because they think cannabis oil will cure them.
This is why we need good science + honest brokers who tell patients, doctors, and the public what works and doesn't work w/cannabinoids
4417 2018-04-18 16:12:53 More than 60 percent of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.” Buhari is just clueless and DULL

4420 2018-04-18 16:12:34 Thank you dear MJP. I think they are giving oil for free to get used and old arms.
4421 2018-04-18 16:12:32 Agree with point no 2. Ni macam makeup remover je instead of cleansing oil, like baby oil. Macam2 jenis oil pulak tu ada.

4444 2018-04-18 16:10:52 This is about selling oil to Asia and shipping it by oil tanker all the way to the other side of the planet to turn a quick buck at BC’s environmental risk. That’s not economics, that’s environmental prostitution!
4445 2018-04-18 16:10:48 That is very surprising, the oil companies have told us that these pipes are incredibly safe. That one of them actually broke and spilled large quantities of oil is surprising indeed. It's almost like we can't trust what corporations are telling us...what have things come to?

4454 2018-04-18 16:10:01 Their unions know that they have the upper hand, because there is a shortage of pipelines, oil needs to be shipped by rail and the result is no capacity to ship grain.Shutting down the railways will hurt our economy, should be deemed an essential service to stop strike

4459 2018-04-18 16:09:21 Why did they put olive oil in their uterus?
4460 2018-04-18 16:09:20 The people in power need to diversify their portfolio, move from oil based business to hemp, it will be legalized in hours when they do that
4461 2018-04-18 16:09:08 If you think we can out muscle United, City, Barca, PSG or any of the top tier clubs financially you’re mistaken. Never have and never will with oil money and Russian money controlling clubs

4469 2018-04-18 16:08:39 That's not an answer troll. You can't tell me why oil is bullish or not. Saudi Arabia makes a comment and you think you're a genius.

4473 2018-04-18 16:08:16 A slight blow against your Davy oil lamp will extinguish it, and to light it again you will have to find a place where there is no fire damp. Take a long time looking for the place.

- You will replace God woth Papa
- You will replace Prayer woth Oil for R150
- You will replace working hard with I Recieve 

NB. Jesus didn't die for you to beg, but for you to have an abundance life

-  Motladi
4476 2018-04-18 16:08:05 Yeah that's my point. Oil needs to be phased out and renewables phased in. Pipeline money & effort would be better spent on wind & solar farms. Who are these people who wanna end oil but not the second half of the job?
4477 2018-04-18 16:07:54 Been bout it every nigga w me popping like oil or sum
4478 2018-04-18 16:07:53 Remember where there's gas there's oil.

4486 2018-04-18 16:07:00 Lefties like safe injection sites because they are the safest way to take drugs. Pipelines are the safest way to transport oil yet somehow the same logic on safe injection sites becomes no longer logical.  #Ideology
4487 2018-04-18 16:07:00 Why are all these logistics company the same.

4491 2018-04-18 16:06:42 Venenzuela, a country rich in oil reserves, finds their oil is a "wee" bit on the expensive side.  Solution? Hmm... Oh wait; why not import the oil?  Where's the media/Hollywood (yes, these names can be used interchangeably) now?  Where's the love?  So sad.

4493 2018-04-18 16:06:38 So I just discovered this skin care and hair brand called Love Beauty and Planet. It’s free of animal testing, vegan, ethically sourced extract, no sulfates, safe for sensitive skin and it’s made with organic coconut oil. It’s priced pretty reasonable too
4494 2018-04-18 16:06:35 じゃね

4496 2018-04-18 16:06:31 So that's small population Norway sitting on massive Oil & Gas reserves, small population Switzerland banking money from every crook, arms dealer and dictator in the world and very small population Iceland that has a tourism/financial services economy
4497 2018-04-18 16:06:19 Not me. I use the cream at least twice a week, face looks like its been dowsed in oil but mornings are beautiful 
4498 2018-04-18 16:06:18 you mean only oil??? cos yes agree
4499 2018-04-18 16:06:12 IMHO - I want to see true pipeline protestors that live of the grid! It’s so hypocritical seeing them in neoprene rain jackets, all made with oil!!! Educate us on how to live off the grid first.
4500 2018-04-18 16:06:10 First of all, there is quite the mess to clean up, 2) why should we followan example that is unsustainable, and is now being proved that only companies are benefiting no one else.  Where will the the lost venue come from, what would you cut. Oil prices dried up thats why industry
4501 2018-04-18 16:06:09 that chilli oil would get emptied within a week. we drizzle it over EVERYTHING, esp pizza/pastas :)
4502 2018-04-18 16:06:03 Despite the entrepreneurial spirit of Nigerians acknowledged home & abroad, Buhari want to CHOGM and said “they’re claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.” I am enraged. I am angry.

4505 2018-04-18 16:05:50 @SecretaryZinke As for oil & gas, you are wrong & I suspect lying.  Oil & gas is in the Bears Ears area. Production has been low of the past years & since oil is cheap, it isn't necessarily worth drilling there. But your goal was oil & gas for those corporations.
4506 2018-04-18 16:05:46 Adhula which oil pour panni thee kolithanum?

4514 2018-04-18 16:04:58 The people of BC hopefully know that cutting the oil supply would only happen as a last resort. Horgan must stand up to the greens and approve this project.

4519 2018-04-18 16:04:45 Sure you do. You're making a point that it's ridiculous for the Senate to explore ways to further enhance & develop Canada's domestic food industry, like when people want our oil refined in Canada.

I'm just pointing out that those blue collar jobs matter.
4520 2018-04-18 16:04:34 Our agenda is "To Make Maharashtra The Worlds Envy"

4522 2018-04-18 16:04:14 I say if these environmentalists want to experience what a green party life would be like let them experience it. #turnoffthetaps. See how businesses and economies will shut down. Technology is not quite ready for no oil or gas... Let BC experience it firsthand.
4523 2018-04-18 16:04:12 Citizens United was the beginning and the end of a corporate coup. The oligarchs have won. Lock, stock and oil barrel.
4524 2018-04-18 16:04:10 Don’t forget about the flaming oil barrel business!
4525 2018-04-18 16:04:03 Had some pasta with olive oil. Not sure if they used too much, but now I feel really sick 
4526 2018-04-18 16:03:57 I blame the guys that changed the oil.

4528 2018-04-18 16:03:54 Funny that alberta is holding up Victoria's lack of sewage infrastructure as a reason a pipeline should be expanded. Like we need sewage AND oil spills. they have been taking about doing this since forever, maybe for than 40 years, another glaring need of Amalgamation. #yyj

4530 2018-04-18 16:03:39 Ah, ha. Then I am in good company. I could live on oats apples sweet potatoes and honey. Bread too. Coconut oil. That’s about it. There isn’t any evidence of plaque on my heart. True. Doctors can’t understand why. Basically my heart will never stop but everything else will.
4531 2018-04-18 16:03:36 So the generator is finally resting after 65 hrs of run time. Probably should look at changing that oil now #hydrobackon

4543 2018-04-18 16:02:39 It still completely baffles me when an organization holds itself to be both a media outlet and PR/Promotions. 

The two should be like oil and water and not mix. 

But maybe that’s just me 
4544 2018-04-18 16:02:30 yeee so now we can take our laptops to Starbucks get free wifi and seat there all day without buying anything and nobody can kick us out  more points if you're black, so if they kick you out you can call for a boycott and sue everyone or get free coffee for life

4546 2018-04-18 16:02:12 Well unless we get an oil sheikh in, we ain't spending loads. Our stadium, once all the stands are done, should top out 75,000 or there abouts (2030-40 when that's finished). So really we will be a moneyball team until FSG leave. Which is okay

Where the indigenous peoples are still being victimized?
Where banks get bailouts after screwing consumers?
Where oil companies have major spills in waterways with no repercussions?
I could keep going.

4564 2018-04-18 16:01:33 OK, so can we all agree now that the net "non-commercial" commitment of traders position is utterly useless in assessing either 1) the true speculative market position or 2) the direction of prices for both crude oil and the euro?

4567 2018-04-18 16:01:18 love how you show your hate for oil @GreenpeaceUK  by displaying a picture all across social media of a fake pipeline made of oil, banners made of oil, hardhats made of oil, polyester coveralls made of oil, all transported by vehicles made of oil, the hipocracy is astounding

4569 2018-04-18 16:00:56 The fact that it brings huge profit to the country doesn't make palm oil okay, same with the tobacco industry. These shits need to go away. I don't care if this country will suffer for it. Change needs sacrifice.

4578 2018-04-18 16:00:12 1) Most probably because of the "essential oil blend with love" as essential oil can be quite irritating to some people.

2) Kalau ikut ingredients list, this is 100% pure oil. That means it doesn't emulsify. Soooo, you guna macam mana ? Like other commercial cleansing oil ?

They import some refined fuel from Washington (produced from Alberta oil delivered through the existing KM pipeline) but not 3 million people worth.

4591 2018-04-18 15:59:27 Thanks... This definitely has shades of 2012. A simultaneous shortage of drilling resources and constrained offtake capacity (and discounted oil) contains its own solution, doesn't it? Slow down and let pipelines catch up!

4663 2018-04-18 15:52:42 You don't know the half of it..these guys spill oil on the roads so that there are accidents, tow your car without consent & strip it to smithereens then steal whatever valuables they can find! The one time they crashed into each other at the scene of the accident they had caused

Welcome back to the fold, John.
4669 2018-04-18 15:52:20 You dey find oil spill abi?
4670 2018-04-18 15:52:20 That's what Putin's chef Yevgeny Prigozhin tried to do with his Wagner attack on Deir-el-Zor on 7 Feb. Wagner wants the oil to cover their costs. Prigozhin also runs the Internet Research Agency, the outfit that meddled in the 2016 Prez election.

4678 2018-04-18 15:51:41 Hello sir, if oil price is moving towards $100 for barrel,what stocks can be tracked? Only ongc or IOC, etc...
4679 2018-04-18 15:51:38 คณะไรหรอ
4680 2018-04-18 15:51:37 I feel like every time you get your oil changed they tell you your car is about to explode unless you do XYZ thing
4681 2018-04-18 15:51:27 UPDATE 7-Oil rises 2 pct as Saudi Arabia aims at $100/bbl, U.S stockpiles fall #energy #oil
4682 2018-04-18 15:51:27 UPDATE 1-U.S. oil inventories drop on strong demand - EIA #energy #oil
4683 2018-04-18 15:51:27 คณะไรหรอ
4684 2018-04-18 15:51:27 Oil tops $68 for the first time in more than three years as US crude stockpiles fall #energy #oil
4685 2018-04-18 15:51:23 Oil/bond action/yields aren’t really equity “friendly” right now...can’t say I’m not itching to short
4686 2018-04-18 15:51:22 Yes Lou Lou, the quantity is 100,000 barrels per day, and it's a very cheap delivery, IRI oil minister tried hard to abolish the agreement but unfortunately its mentioned in UN security council resolution
4687 2018-04-18 15:51:22 Fundamentally oil isn't strong. Only a 1k draw with good products consumption? Saudi Arabia (their dictatorship) is dirty scum. They "leaked" their 80-100 comment the day they knew they manipulate EIA numbers. #OOTTmoron s falling for it.

4692 2018-04-18 15:50:57 Are you willing to waste #ANWR, undermine Alaska Native Cultures, and bake in more global climate change for any amount of oil and money? We’re not. There are alternatives: deconsume, up efficiency, transition to renewable energies. @LtGovMallott @AkGovBillWalker @lisamurkowski
4693 2018-04-18 15:50:33 The government of Israel have  not sold oil shares ! They have granted the right to drill for oil on land that does not belong to Israel but illegally occupied. It would be akin to having stolen your house I then allow your neighbor to build a swimming pool for their enjoyment

4699 2018-04-18 15:49:55 When US revved up sanctions against NK, China (Trumps good friend Pres Xi) and Russia were transferring oil to them tanker to tanker. Sanctions still had an effect. Tariffs on China being met with billion$ tariffs on Sorghum (bet those Kansas farmers aren't too happy)...
4700 2018-04-18 15:49:51 Of late, been cooking with Canola Oil and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.
4701 2018-04-18 15:49:47 Canada has a very low population, feeds the world and has vast raw materials. Most other countries make money off of Canada. We can't all drive electric cars out here. Europeans on their high horse. They are not self sufficient. Innovation will make the oil sand more ecological.
4702 2018-04-18 15:49:42 @ScottBaio today i ate a turtles head fried in gutter oil, but you are still too repulsive for me to stomach

4715 2018-04-18 15:48:03 Use oil on your scalp after shampooing. You should always do this when your hair and scalp is clean.
4716 2018-04-18 15:48:02 They are both lubricant. That poster must distinguish between water based and oil based personal lubricant.

4722 2018-04-18 15:47:23 Yeah! Let's build a pipeline now.
We've finally got rid of those pesky natural things.
Who needs wildlife when we've got oil!
4723 2018-04-18 15:47:13 Then you should remove/destroy all knives to support anti-violence movement in Britain.  Bats to support domestic violence survivors.  Megaphones to make sure negative voices aren't heard.  Rope to stop suicide.  Better to just shut down your stores to make sure your saving all.
4724 2018-04-18 15:46:58 When I found you, you was putting on jergens now you want Tom Ford oil for 1b
4725 2018-04-18 15:46:56 “More than 60 % of d population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school & they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit & do nothing, & get housing, healthcare, educatn for free.” Pres. @MBuhari speaking in London on 18/04/2018.

4730 2018-04-18 15:46:39 We also got some good hash as a treat, green Moroccan, yellow and red Lebanese, and my favourite, black Afghani. But it was rare.

Even rarer was getting weed or hash oil. I used  to cover a paper and then roll it with tobacco.

4735 2018-04-18 15:46:10 D ? that should be asked is y did NNPC have 2 billion of any currency in a foreign bank to begin with. The oil that NNPC is selling isn't it Nigeria it is coming from? Abi was it a savings account. See pot calling kettle black.. smh.. all of u r d same.

4748 2018-04-18 15:44:45 Scientist predict 100% of oil will be burned that is on earth within 100 years and whether we burn it all now in a day or slowly over 100 years the affect will be the EXACT same.

4766 2018-04-18 15:43:37 Yes, of course. Some things are not for sale as they belong to the people of Syria. Israeli/U.S./UK/France/Saudi do not want to understand that Syria is a sovereign country and they have to get out ! Imagine Israelis selling Syrian oil shares. Its quite clear they WANT that land.

4790 2018-04-18 15:41:40 Prince MbS needs pricey oil as the Kingdom is increasingly hard pressed to keep its population of slaves from Bengladesh, Pakistan, the Philippines and Ethiopia at the pumps (and at the houses) of its minority Saudi demographics. Time to factor Petroyuan into analysis.
4791 2018-04-18 15:41:39 Said governments funding trillion dollar deficits with said fiat currencies will never let it happen. Remember what happened to Ghaddafi when he tried to create the PetroDollar to trade oil in? He’s 6 feet deep now.

Third largest US city with one of the biggest ports and rich in oil money to the democrat dump that has progressed in Puerto Rico. Lol. Houston has power because people need it to conduct business.

4818 2018-04-18 15:39:45 Agree re above (just checked in with our oil guys who kinda confirmed that). I guess the point is that it shows how US foreign and economic policy can fuel "de-dollarisation" (ie, that the world is far too dollarized than what economic fundamentals like trade/finance justifies)

4829 2018-04-18 15:39:04 Great to hear my beloved #UAE is leading the way in solar. With the fact that solar is such a leveler (cheap for any country to produce) what will be interesting (disturbing??) to watch will be the fact that the wars for oil which generate revenue for the US won’t be required 
4830 2018-04-18 15:38:59 But the issue here is, the local price had been static since mid march where as the oil prices had been increasing since USD63 since that time. But how come price is the same? Can we really kawal harga petrol when we want to regardless the fluctuations of the global oil prices?
4831 2018-04-18 15:38:54 In case you #OOTTmoron s didn't realize, this EIA has a big weak point. With good product draws we got only a small draw. Shouldn't we have had like -7k?

4851 2018-04-18 15:36:38 “More than 60% of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education free.” President Buhari. 

I am not crying 
4852 2018-04-18 15:36:37 It's Trump / Russian style fake news pushing the pipeline.
If the Sun wants a expose they should follow the money. It lead straight to the Oil companies.

CTV and Global keep making the headlines pro pipe. Low info voters seldom read the whole article.

4860 2018-04-18 15:35:50 This is what to watch. The exports are driving the inventory draws, Crude oil exports were 8x the inventory drop.  I don't care who you are that's a lot of oil leaving and going to a country who provides less information #OOTT.

4862 2018-04-18 15:35:43 Look at that chart carefully - the big jump came in the past week, so it wouldn't be reflected in prices this week. Also, how many litres are there in a barrel of oil?

4868 2018-04-18 15:35:34 Try applying that test to oil companies abandoning old wells and failing to meet their environmental obligations in Canada. Actions do speak louder than words.
4869 2018-04-18 15:35:31 Man I hope Energy is a bull trap...And I can’t wait until this Aramco ipo is over so the shenanigans can stop. There’s NO true reason for oil prices to rise in America.

4872 2018-04-18 15:35:26 U wouldn’t say going into the military because it’s a noble thing to do. I’d say going to fight another pointless war and die for oil 
4873 2018-04-18 15:35:20 Yes, but is there oil underneath? That's all #45 and Scott Pruitt care about.
4874 2018-04-18 15:35:20 I don't think those prices are correct. In 2018 dollars, the average WTI oil price from 1986 to 2004 was $40.64/bbl (not $22) and from 2015-2017 the average price was $54/bbl. That's a ratio of 1.3X, not 2.3X. It looks like the prices in the chart are nominal and not real?

4926 2018-04-18 15:31:54 Oh “special case”, welfare Quebec... let’s not forget that Quebec imports the vast majority of its oil (97% in 2012). Yet, they continuously receive 60% of ALL transfer payments in . Take with one hand and slap us in the face with the other... nothing ever changes.
4927 2018-04-18 15:31:51 The eyeball at the top of the pyramid on money is actually a tiny camera! Punk rock was invented by an ad agency to sell spikey pins! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!

4930 2018-04-18 15:31:35 Been over a week since I tried argan oil, and my sensitive skin is reacting well, yay! Might be hope on my part, but I could’ve sworn my blemishes got lighter. Whilst I love coconut oil for makeup removal, it doesn’t get absorbed into my skin, and just leaves me feeling sticky.

4932 2018-04-18 15:31:30 @JustinTrudeau do not give public money to the #TransMountainPipeline. Canada’s transition to a #NoCarbon era should include #divesting from oil, NOT more subsidies to petrolium conglomerates. #JustSayNoToPipelines

4953 2018-04-18 15:30:23 Fracking is lightly regulated in the US due to its exemption from Safe Drinking Water Act restrictions. Companies – such as those operating in the Pavillion Field region, which has more than 180 oil and gas wells – are usually able to drill to any chosen depth.
4954 2018-04-18 15:30:20 Its beyond obvious that SA is withholding their exports to the US on purpose. Again, with good product draws, the crude draw wasn't big. That shows weakness, not strength. Once SA blinks, quick builds will be here.

4957 2018-04-18 15:29:54 The only thing that irks Horgan more than Alberta shipping oil thru BC is Alberta threatening to stop shipping oil thru BC.

4961 2018-04-18 15:29:36 The Koch Bros. only want no government involvement when it comes to EPA restrictions that would affect their oil and gas businesses.  They also do not want to pay taxes that may go towards social welfare programs because a combined net worth of $96.6B is not enough.

4973 2018-04-18 15:28:53 To squeak out a draw going further on rising production.. imports have to keep on going down and exports have to keep on rising.(which is stagnant). Either of those will get harder and harder..just plain commonsense. #OOTT

4985 2018-04-18 15:27:57 This EIA has bullish elements. But with such good product draws, shouldn't we get bigger crude draws? Imports influenced this. That shows weakness, not strength. But .....SA/Russia are meeting Friday, and SA wants 80-100 so the idiots will buy. Their loss will be celebrated.

4989 2018-04-18 15:27:52 A small spill like that is easily cleaned up in the ocean. A spill is also much less likely to happen on a tanker. Tankers have two layers, called a double hull. It's like an oil barrel in a bigger oil barrel. The pipeline is a single layer. There is literally zero comparison.

4992 2018-04-18 15:27:30 Curious: I’ve seen reports that oil and gas creates 2 jobs for every $1M invested, while renewables creates 15+ jobs for same investment. Is this just false, or have you limited your view of resource development to just oil and gas?

5015 2018-04-18 15:25:28 You are changing the timeline on your call. Last time it was $50 by May, now its $50 in the coming months, and the whole time you have missed out on of the most bullish rallies in oil in years. So, as a reminder, you have 12 days left in April to get oil back to $50. Good luck!!

5051 2018-04-18 15:23:19 $CL_F new highs on the move… we’ve been unapologetically bullish on Oil. I’ll discuss again in tonight’s mid-week video.
5052 2018-04-18 15:23:17 No need to worry about gainful employment. All the libs will be rounded up and shipped off to frozen labor camps in the oil fields of what used to be ANWR in the glorious future following the abolition of the Constitution (which they'll replace with Art of the Deal).

5056 2018-04-18 15:22:42 The oil stocks are not up because Brent is over 70, they’re up because <50 is off the table for the foreseeable future, but hyperventilate over every dollar if you must.

5065 2018-04-18 15:22:11 So, Canada generates 1.5% of the world’s total carbon emissions but will this will increase it to 15%? You need a new statistician. Look, oil isn’t going anywhere for now but at least  is looking to lower carbon emissions everywhere it can. Go after  and  45% combined
5066 2018-04-18 15:22:11 I'd be embarrassed too. I mean, who puts funsize golden Oreos next to family packs of cooking oil?!
5067 2018-04-18 15:22:07 Could be, but the election is still far off and there are lots of rumblings about publicly funding a Texas oil firm over talking to First Nations / territorial rights.. let alone the impact to the BC coast.

5085 2018-04-18 15:21:36 As a country we are reducing our dependency on the middle East for crude oil and now that companies have more freedom we can expect to see a massive drop over the next 2 years. Currently the prices are a bit above average but that's also after last year's huge cut.

5094 2018-04-18 15:21:02 Since BC wants to go green Alberta should help them f/forward it by turning off the oil taps. Then they can use their clean water to run their vehicles, green forests to heat their homes, and their surplus rain as Jet A1 for planes using their airports.

5196 2018-04-18 15:14:19 30% of Canada's oil was coming in from Turkey. So you can put the pieces together. ISIS was caught red handed selling the stolen oil to turkey.

5202 2018-04-18 15:14:00 Supper was more of a steam-roast because I'd marinaded the chicken breasts in: Herbs de Provence (tesco), garlic, lemon juice, lemon zest, olive oil, a teaspoon of St Dalfour's marmalade, sea salt. So lots of liquid, but it was great over the salad so I'm not complaining.
5203 2018-04-18 15:13:49 TX oil and gas regulator @ChristianForTX at state house hearing: biggest threat to oil and gas is "misunderstanding" of industry, and "the acceptance of the politically correct-driven environmental anti-oil and gas science."
5204 2018-04-18 15:13:42 exactly the problem, everyone is focused on blocking oil as if that somehow causes renewables to fill the void.  It doesn't.  But it is fashionable to demonize oil which is responsible for our standard of living and carp about renewables like there is some conspiracy afoot.
5205 2018-04-18 15:13:35 With a US Glut of oil! Is this what a Free market means?

5212 2018-04-18 15:13:11 That's enough. We are now being inundated by Trump style fake information. Oil companies are lying to you about the benefits of the pipeline. Stop and think. We have nothing to gain by this pipeline and a lot to loose.
5213 2018-04-18 15:13:09 My takeaway is that if you lobbied for, say the oil and gas industry, you can't be hired by the EPA, but you could be hired by a different department. Which is actually less strict of a ban then Obama's was. So it's really, in many ways a deregulation disguised as a ban. Sneaky
5214 2018-04-18 15:13:09 Yes, because the sun reflects off the water. Probably mosquitos, gnats. We used spray. I don’t remember horseflies, which are vicious. The oil sounds wonderful! I will have to look into that sunscreen, thank you. My mother is allergic to PABA.

5218 2018-04-18 15:12:42 Your logic is twisted! Most alternatives to #PalmOil do not require tropical climates to be grown. Palm oil does and therefore continues to encourage the destruction of rainforest.

5234 2018-04-18 15:11:21 Were going to be in terrible trouble if we continue to rely on only oil and gas instead of developing clean, renewable resources. (And I own numerous oil stocks.)
5235 2018-04-18 15:11:17 Empty noggins suing for this really how sad. What do they think would happen if Gas &  oil products were stopped being delivered to these Colorado communities? do they really think at all?
5236 2018-04-18 15:11:12 Venezuelan oil production was running at 2 million barrels per day in September...at the end of March its running at 1.5 million barrels per day and on pace to hit zero by next summer. Well done comrades.

5242 2018-04-18 15:10:48 One could speculate, the drop i oil price was because of ISIS flooding the markets with cheap stolen oil. But then you have to ask yourself, who was buying it.
5243 2018-04-18 15:10:47 @StTabitha Sometimes I feel I should commission  @pixelkitties to give you a pic of Rarity fainting and Granny Smith losing her dentures at the sight of Flim and Flam ramming an oil pipeline through Ponyville. And Luna is filling an injunction at town hall if you look closely.
5244 2018-04-18 15:10:42 They ask the wrong question. Thay should have asked instead "what is there on Earth that wouldn't be had there been another industrial civilization before our own?" And the answer is: vast reserves of oil. That alone proves we're the first.

5249 2018-04-18 15:10:31 The way I read the article, it is the COGCC's regulations that should be challenged under Title VI. But either way, a federal court challenge seems necessary. Hard to win in state court against a western state oil and gas commission, most of which are very powerful.

It's oil, so literally anything is possible; right now, "feels" like it is settling into a balance zone here right around 68.

5287 2018-04-18 15:07:07 @walmfinsdorf I am sorry you don't see the support. In Jan'18 oil, inventories were falling at a rate close to ~8% YoY in Mar'18 the YoY decline is ~3% when we are talking over 5B barrells that is a pretty substantial slowdown, but you may not think that is a rapid decrease.

Any suggestions?

5333 2018-04-18 15:03:17 ...start using more Canadian oil”, ok cool, but how ya gonna do it? You think govt should force Irving to buy more expensive Canadian product and lower profits? Sounds kinda socialist. Or since we can’t/shouldn’t be telling big biz what to do, should govt build new refineries?...

5338 2018-04-18 15:01:58 Your right, these places are scattered across our land,Utah, Alaska, our ocean shores, oil pipe lines running through land that doesn't even belong to us. Our water, land and air.Trump will see it desroyed. If we don't  stop him now it will be too late.
5339 2018-04-18 15:01:54 But also raised them around that time last year. And utility hikes look like being less than a year ago - I keep stressing you cannot ignore base effects! This time last year sterling's drop was pushing up costs for most businesses. Oil etc quoted in $ so £ drop had major impact

5342 2018-04-18 15:01:41 After the collapse of the USSR, Russia did NOT institute a proper Capitalist system.  Instead they built their new economy almost entirely on their rich oil resources.  That's why their economy is so fragile and can't fly.  And, ONE major shock to oil and it's ruination for them.
5343 2018-04-18 15:01:39 New King is very progressive.  Saudi could eventually build on the Mecca pilgrimage to increase spending on tourism.  This could eventually be a major revenue to help replace the finite oil revenue.

5360 2018-04-18 15:00:35 Crude oil is now over $68 per barrel. This will hurt economic development of China and India. Much of the CPEC is based on coal power plants, so Pakistan development will continue.

5373 2018-04-18 14:59:28 Why exactly are ignorant brits concerned about a pipeline in CANADA? Its a better more efficient way of transportinh oil. Do you have any idea how much driving would have to be done to transport the same amount of oil on trucks?

5395 2018-04-18 14:57:42 maybe but the oil is not being taken away and less then what we are doing so maybe yes maybe no. tons of small frackers around THAT NEED A BUYOUT
5396 2018-04-18 14:57:38 Ordered CBD oil for my doggie. He loves it. CBD oil addresses his pain from hereditary hip dysplasia and soothes him when he gets scared because of gun shots and thunderstorms. He decides if he wants it or not when I offer it to him. #CBDoil
5397 2018-04-18 14:57:34 You don't need to convince me of that -I spend my life fighting enviro impacts of human activity. However, I think you're failing to comprehend that even if Big Oil Canada was tampering w/ cloud seeding etc, scale wouldn't noticeably cool climate in our generation.

Either way, we'll know soon..

5406 2018-04-18 14:56:44 I wonder if @Glade will come up with some man-cave fragrances? Old engine oil, 2-stroke exhaust, beer, cheeseburger, maybe a cross promo with 
@OriginalWD40_UK ?
5407 2018-04-18 14:56:41 Maybe oil inventories were posted? Unseasonably cold nation wide in Canada. I don't know though.
5408 2018-04-18 14:56:39 I'm guessing here that statistically it will be manufacturing which of course includes oil exported to overseas refineries and is therefore not a true indicator of our true manufacturing capacity which ... IMHO ,,, is pathetically low and far too narrowly based.
5409 2018-04-18 14:56:38 And not only one of them, the thief took my ENTIRE oil collection 
5410 2018-04-18 14:56:36 Oil prices are spiking thanks to the failed presidency of @realDonaldTrump. This directly impacts the working class, the people he claims to stand for. But it’s good for all his big oil donors.
5411 2018-04-18 14:56:27 Zuma and humility..oil and water
5412 2018-04-18 14:56:25 The two companies are like oil and water. @ChickfilA stands for what it believes in and is community oriented. The other can’t turn left any harder if it was a bicycle.
5413 2018-04-18 14:56:24 Was there ever a concept of peak gas in US? How does the gas price today compare to previous prices of conventional gas? In UK we think of shale gas as being the game changer for planet earth not so much shale oil
5414 2018-04-18 14:56:14 Cheap oil is better than any tax cut for the middle class. What are we gonna do now that prices are at 3 year highs?
5415 2018-04-18 14:56:10 $CL_F as long as it doesn't start rolling over, plenty of room to run on $SPX. But when oil ticks up to a multiyear high, always wall of worry a bubble pops and takes down $SPX with it.

5417 2018-04-18 14:56:00 Also, (and maybe some economists can shut me down on this) but I still think low oil prices have played a critical role in the global recovery of the last few years and can't believe that higher oil prices won't be a drag.
5418 2018-04-18 14:55:58 A lot of signs showing up for oil topping out very soon

5427 2018-04-18 14:55:18 Killing time at the mall while I get my oil changed, there are some interesting people here.  

Like a grown man eating a banana split in front of Dairy Queen by himself at 11 AM.  That takes courage.
5428 2018-04-18 14:55:03 Right. Because the little bottles of roots and herbs and 99.99999% diluted saliva and snake oil are given away for free? Take a look at the profitability of the companies selling you repackaged water?

5433 2018-04-18 14:54:09 Like we've been discussing for years, Gary, everyone is in favour of fighting climate change as long as the oil barons & industry titans are paying the freight. But when Joe & Jane Taxpayer see his/her wallet lightened, the fervor for climate action starts to fade.
5434 2018-04-18 14:53:53 Two hundred and twenty five bucks. In April 2008, Jeff Rubin, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, predicted a barrel of oil would cost $225 by 2012. With oil at $118, it was a controversial call.

He told me to put some motor oil in it for now.

5442 2018-04-18 14:53:25 yet there's time for *certain prayers* and teachings. imported oil brings imported agenda. We need to open up our oil and go back to basics in the education system, the basics that help people get jobs.

5777 2018-04-18 14:29:42 So state governors should chase the FG to solve environmental issues?

I don't think Governors chase FG to come and collect revenue from crude oil.

I don't think Governors chase the FG when there are pipeline vandalism leading to reduced revenue.

The real problem is that extracting oil from the tar sands is polluting waters & the largest source of greenhouse gases in North America.

5826 2018-04-18 14:25:26 It's disturbing that oil and gas formed alliances with local churches to help transform our communities from safe havens to danger zones. How can anyone trust spiritual guidance from church leaders when they, themselves, have gone over to the dark side?
5827 2018-04-18 14:25:11 you do realize that Putin is the one giving NK all the tech and military material and oil. Careful what you think is a good thing.
5828 2018-04-18 14:25:07 Actually as the poll shows, Canada does want a pipeline. Getting oil to world markets enables  us to get a better price than selling to the US. Oil will eventually be done but leverage it now to build the economic strength needed to transition to more renewables.

5869 2018-04-18 14:21:37 It's not about the oil per se. It's more about the minerals under the ground and the access to regional routes to control the Middle East.

5924 2018-04-18 14:17:43 Diesel engines don't have an air throttle, because they work by regulating the flow of fuel.

5976 2018-04-18 14:13:29 Dear @JustinTrudeau Where's the 2 billion for solar and wind? Climate leaders don't build pipelines. No bail out for Texas oil company that made 13.7 billion last year! #colonialism #noconsent #climatechange #kindermorgan #bcpoli #stopKM #actonclimate #notankers

5978 2018-04-18 14:13:22 We can’t increase the production to market via pipelines. Our oil is sold half of the world market
5979 2018-04-18 14:13:19 We have our own oil...thank you very much...just wait until we stop buying yours.

Humans allowing other humans to suffer and die without lifting a finger.....CDC says "Grapefruit oil will save the day!"
5981 2018-04-18 14:13:03 They need to find that oil.

5990 2018-04-18 14:12:12 I gotta check with Bannon but I wonder if I can sell the strategic oil reserve to my friends. I'll get a good price!
5991 2018-04-18 14:12:11 @realDonaldTrump you need to get these oil prices in check. Your tax cuts mean nothing as we put that $$ in our gas tax as you and others in Washington get rich off big oil

I suppose you believe that white "American" immigrants "freed" the #NativeAmericans & awarded them little pieces of dead desert with poor water & lots of oil pipelines. #WakeUpAmerica Fix this!

6004 2018-04-18 14:10:59 Hey @JustinTrudeau, do you really want to go down in history as #JustinCrudeau? Do the right thing & don't build new oil pipelines. The world is watching. #StopKM #StopPipelines #cdnpoli
6005 2018-04-18 14:10:57 We are getting a new clock in machine, it uses your finger print. We are also getting PDAs for time keeping. The method of draining oil from vehicles into the bulk waste container, is with a 200 litre drum with the top cut off and then when thats full, a mop bucket. Priorities..
6006 2018-04-18 14:10:56 yang ni no fragrance, coloront, alcohol & mineral oil
6007 2018-04-18 14:10:54 And, U.S. oil producers will be glad to help. Pretty soon they'll roll out the "It's supply & demand, market forces, et al, again".
6008 2018-04-18 14:10:52 Being in the oil and gas industry, I can't say I don't agree with fracking. However, I don't believe in forcing people to give up sacred land for the sake of destroying it.
6009 2018-04-18 14:10:52 If sanctions re-emerge they won’t we selling oil for any currency but backdoor dodgy bullions and bags of rice from Pakistan
6010 2018-04-18 14:10:49 I actually make something a bit like that, but no cream. Just toss the pasta in a mixture of garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, cheese, and various spices/seasonings.

6017 2018-04-18 14:10:23 The only reason they are involved is , Tredeau and his greedy caucus have large amount of stocks in the oil sectors.All about the greed and insider trading I believe

6020 2018-04-18 14:10:18 We have to stop this pipeline no benefit to the people of Canada Just CEOs of large oil companies and governments for more tax from us
6021 2018-04-18 14:10:11 2,4 Dichlorophenol is a biproduct of triclosan degradation. So if there’s triclosan in the oil as a preservative and the oil was exposed to light, you could be getting some photo-degradation. 
6022 2018-04-18 14:10:08 はーい！いきますよー！
6023 2018-04-18 14:10:02 Crude oil prices must have been down.
6024 2018-04-18 14:09:59 Because Pruitt is working to do the harm that Trump wants to see and the putting of more money into the hands of coal and oil companies while screwing the planet and the people
6025 2018-04-18 14:09:54 double cleansing only oil cleanser.. yg ni cleansing water. dia tak disolve oil kat muka and tak deep cleansing .. correct me if im wrong.
6026 2018-04-18 14:09:51 For me, its more about knowing the fact that without crude oil rents only a handful of states can possibly even meet their recurrent expenditures! And this cuts across all the country. 

Shows the unproductive level/nature of our local economies across board!
6027 2018-04-18 14:09:50 Now a days it feels like it's mandatory to keep a stone, crystal, metal, incense, oil, prayer, affirmation, mantra, mudra, yoga pose, etc for stability, grounding; removing negativity from within, around self or whatever is being projected towards self. Stay sane, stay balanced.
6028 2018-04-18 14:09:46 indomie and egg or oil rice

6032 2018-04-18 14:09:26 You are in a constant search for the Republican Party that you believed to be the bedrock of Conservatism - it was all an illusion. It was all flimflam and snake oil. Give up the search and reclaim your sanity.
6033 2018-04-18 14:09:19 If you pakai sunscreen, makeup better you guna oil cleanser for double cleansing.
6034 2018-04-18 14:09:19 Big oil?  how about Big Natural Gas - companies like $WPX are doing well selling more NG to electric producers to charge EVs...   Big fuels will want more EVs.  Also in my region - oil is also a small segment of electricity generation for the grid.
6035 2018-04-18 14:09:18 Not that nationalizing the oil industry isn’t a bad idea.
6036 2018-04-18 14:08:59 working off an old model but can confirm CRC has some of, if not highest leverage to oil (brent tie also)....my model from couple yrs ago suggests every $5 move in oil worth about $1 billion in pv-10 value and $125-150mm ebitda

6040 2018-04-18 14:08:51 $XOP is (at times) a leading indicator for #oil as big money can preemptively create a position before a known move on the commodity comes! 
6041 2018-04-18 14:08:32 I wonder if it would be cheaper to make your own? I did that using a good cannabis oil, mixed with organic coconut oil. You can buy the suppository forms from Amazon in various sizes.
6042 2018-04-18 14:08:11 Try Organic Cold Pressed Jojoba / Hemp seed oil . Bleh buat research dulu .
6043 2018-04-18 14:08:06 Hardworking Canadians don't want to pay corporate welfare to the world's biggest industry. Disgusting! What happened to @JustinTrudeau promise to end oil subsidies? No wonder he pushed out @AmbStephaneDion. @RachelNotley #cdnpoli #stopKM
6044 2018-04-18 14:08:00 $USDCAD doesn't make sense. Eventually BoC will have to increase rate with Oil now almost $68 today. USD Index is dropping too today. I wont be surprised if this reverses here. to 1.2420

6048 2018-04-18 14:07:40 Either way, not today. 

He overheated his boiler to push past the oil slick just past the break as his wheels touched down again.
6049 2018-04-18 14:07:36 Why is it always oil tycoon? Why can’t it be a frittata tycoon or a wrist watch tycoon?
6050 2018-04-18 14:07:32 ada je .. macam hada labo super hyaluronic cleansing oil, nutox, simple. if u sensitif please avoid jugak mineral oil. mineral some people boleh tolerate ikut skin jugak.
6051 2018-04-18 14:07:28 Do they have an ingredient statement? I’m trying to find an MSDS but the only thing I think of is improper storage of the oil ie over exposure to light/oxygen.
6052 2018-04-18 14:07:27 RIGHT IT ALSO ABSORBED THE OIL
6053 2018-04-18 14:07:16 You know you have your friends hooked when they're asking you if you have any hair oil in your @curlbox this month. Hair oil doesn't work for me so I typically share the love with friends.
6054 2018-04-18 14:07:04 @kvngSpice I heard u are a good designer. Can u design a new country for me? 

Don't worry about money. i will give you an oil block and all you need to do is have "faith"....and you will be rich. Like one woman like that.

6058 2018-04-18 14:06:51 Uh oh!  I just read that in your oil rig accent 
6059 2018-04-18 14:06:45 Why? All the oil companies did is provide a product because that's what people demanded. The users of said product are just as complicit; you have no high ground here. That said, you are just as liable for using their product and need to pay your share

6064 2018-04-18 14:06:03 When was this said? By whom? "More than 60% of the population is below 30, a lot of them haven’t been to school and they are claiming that Nigeria is an oil producing country, therefore, they should sit and do nothing, and get housing, healthcare, education for free." @SANNigeria
6065 2018-04-18 14:06:01 네...... 책상 부술 뻔
6066 2018-04-18 14:05:47 There is nothing stopping us from transitioning to renewable energy in all sectors, including EVs.  Oil resources can then be spared for products produced with petroleum & we accomplish reduction of emissions to save the stable climate our civilization was founded upon. #stopkm
6067 2018-04-18 14:05:25 You are not co-operating with Citizens of india by cheating citizens of india interms of huge hike of Gasoline beside crude oil prices are 67.98 dollar /barrel, ₹ 82 petrol price, shameful act. When it was 110 dollar /barrel then it was ₹ 82. You think ppls of india r fools.

6071 2018-04-18 14:04:54 So #TrinidadandTobago what's the plan? Sit and wait until oil&gas prices inflate due to political unrest & ideological conflict? Or take this opportunity to transform our nation into a powerhouse of technological #Innovation by nurturing emerging industries?

6099 2018-04-18 14:03:09 If I am not mistaken, China producedes a whole $#/+ load of oil but still imports, Sweden imports crude and refines it and Iceland is on the hunt for oil (off shore)

6107 2018-04-18 14:02:42 Yes Gerry I do. I am not in the habit of applying labels to folk without cause. As a geologist & somebody with experience in oil, gas and renewable energy, it is a field where I have looked at the evidence and read contrary views.

6114 2018-04-18 14:02:02 Not sure I understand, is this saying that the draws from inventories are simply the oil being moved to rooftop storage tanks? In other words, the draws are misleading?

6136 2018-04-18 14:00:11 Palm oil is not a healthy option. In the EU, we should use European raps or olive oil instead.

6149 2018-04-18 13:58:28 @motomatters Random Q.
Is anyone developing a >1000cc motorcycle race engine that runs on sustainable bio-fuel? Veg oil or similar?
Diesel seemed to work well in endurance racing?
Might soften the blow before I/C engines are banned?
6150 2018-04-18 13:58:15 I completely agreed with this back then, but several of those effects have fully reversed, oil for an example.
6151 2018-04-18 13:58:08 Trudeau's goal is to shut down the oil industry and make Alberta into an backwater with no political power.  He did say Canada is better off when Quebeckers are in charge.
6152 2018-04-18 13:58:07 @elonmusk Elon Musk wants 2dig transportation tunnels in Earthquake Country through old oil wells? Yeah, THAT'S a Super-Genius ACME idea Wylie! 
 Might as well dig some through a volcano. #stick2SpaceX
6153 2018-04-18 13:58:04 You mean the anti-oil spill vote? 

Have you ever seen or helped "clean up" an oil spill, Sir? Just curious.
6154 2018-04-18 13:57:54 This guy at the meeting straight up said that every time the United States drops a bomb the price of oil goes up

6156 2018-04-18 13:57:39 I’m not placing the blame on one party. However, both parties need to stop spending like we’re a rich oil producing country, now that they’ve done everything they can to make sure we aren’t a rich, oil producing country. 

We cannot keep spending like this.

6161 2018-04-18 13:57:07 maybe the construction guys were really village people look alikes....
6162 2018-04-18 13:57:04 If you embraced renewables more, thereby increasing its potential to supply, we would find a reduced demand for oil. But self-interested arguments have a narrow focus so I don't expect much of your echo chamber to see the other side of the coin.

6166 2018-04-18 13:56:23 There are a lot of oil tankers off the west coast as we speak. Who protests again them? Canada is doing a lot to address environmental concerns.

6175 2018-04-18 13:55:44 I ran out of my personal supply of hemp oil ... won’t do that again ... had a bad migraine last night ... essential oils helped but I waited to long for treatment so had to use Tylenol.... usually a double dosage of hemp oil helps me when I get one

6180 2018-04-18 13:55:02 Let me briefly summarize today's oil headlines.  A oil producing country is happy with higher oil, making more money, and is trying to sell an IPO for its oil giant.  Nothing else to hear, we've heard this before
6181 2018-04-18 13:55:01 Wow I would forget my black seed oil 
6182 2018-04-18 13:54:42 This Argan oil been doing me wonders. I need a Just for Men beard and hair shoot.
6183 2018-04-18 13:54:41 it also shows the effect of growing light crude production and falling heavy production on the effect on refinery margins when such a big change as IMO is coming along. That running a refinery os not just about throwing any oil at it.
6184 2018-04-18 13:54:27 @KiaCanada  Buying Kia isnt feasible anymore when commuting, due to clause for "maintenance under severe usage". Very few can do the standard service.  120 hwy kms/day, oil changes 6000 kms makes my Kias too costly.  Winnipeg isnt extreme year round. #nocostsavings #mylastkias
6185 2018-04-18 13:54:25 The energy market is good now. We are selling our oil at half on the market. Notley dropped the ball, her party I well known for not big supporters of pipelines

6215 2018-04-18 13:50:40 Mr. Dppradhanbjp. Are you & your Govt not cheating citizens of india as crude oil is 67.98 dollar /barrel & price of petrol is ₹ 82. When crude oil prices was 110 dollar /barrel then also the prices was ₹ 82. You're the wackiest Minister so is Mr Modi. Shame on such Government
6216 2018-04-18 13:50:38 Lol I just hit that part of the podcast. I agree with Jake. Maybe look into CBD oil
6217 2018-04-18 13:50:33 I find it astonishing that Trudeau is so tone deaf - says one thing in Canada re oil/gas - another thing overseas when he is out of the country. Does he not know the fawning press follows him & reports on his every word? Many Canadians "turnips" are fluent in French.
6218 2018-04-18 13:50:28 Absolutely,coconut are found free on the ground and tropics, also much cheaper to export  than olive oil.

6224 2018-04-18 13:50:01 As you know, I changed my diet. I bought coconut oil for the first time on my life today. As a part of my learning, I made omelette. And what? it was delicious! This soft coconut flavor was amazing. WOW! *__*
6225 2018-04-18 13:49:48 You even know high oil price should have positive effect but you choose to be singing lullaby when it was low
6226 2018-04-18 13:49:43 @theresa_may was skripal just mis direction for the joint syria attack or was our funding of rebels the perpetraiteurs of chem attack.. also clarify pls the national interest other than the route the oil/gas pipeline will take?
6227 2018-04-18 13:49:41 Excessive olive oil were found to cause problems in the uterus. So even a healthy food as olive oil can cause problems! Moderation is the key. Always search the internet for the "side effects" of any type of food u like before consuming it regularly.

6237 2018-04-18 13:48:47 MORNING MARKET WATCH: US stocks open slightly higher. IBM slumps 5% as profits shrink. Morgan Stanley jumps 2% on record earnings. Crude oil prices jump 2% and top $68 a barrel for the first time since December 2014. ~ M
6238 2018-04-18 13:48:46 Seeing a lot of people shorting this. GL & GT with that (that being a rising 50-day SMA). I think picking up nickels in front of steam roller while waiting on oil invenrtories and Fed beige book. But that makes a market!

6242 2018-04-18 13:48:21 Not all indigenous peoples; many have signed deals to allow the pipeline.  BC must demand the proper planning for a spill.  If Alberta want to move the oil and not share the revenue, then put the planning and resources in place to limit the effect of a spill.

6262 2018-04-18 13:46:06 Oh so that justifies a pipeline filled with toxic #DilutedBitumen not crude oil
6263 2018-04-18 13:46:03 What I want, is an economic benefit in the movement of that oil, to the Canadian economy. Moving oil through pipes, does not increase or maintain transportation jobs, it reduces them. Also, in case you didn't know, moving oil through a pipes, takes a considerable amount of energy

6269 2018-04-18 13:45:21 @GovWike played host to traditional rulers across the state some weeks ago. 

What did he do to ensure these traditional rulers discourage the stealing and illegal refining of crude oil in their domains?
6270 2018-04-18 13:45:15 Just use mineral oil in the shower or bath to take it off so you don't hurt your skin. ^^
6271 2018-04-18 13:45:14 Not every barrel. NG used in the extraction process is royalty free. there are lots of credits and programs to save the companies money. We make more from gambling revenue than oil right now. Which is why we have such a large deficit.

6283 2018-04-18 13:44:31 Reminds me of a Sci-fi film where a bug that digested stuff made from oil got loose.
It turned the world into a pre-industrial dystopia since rubber, oil, petroleum, plastics, etc, were consumed.
Bit far fetched, but y'know, tinkering with stuff like this is a serious business.

6306 2018-04-18 13:42:48 @CBCNews I would like CBC to provide balanced reporting regarding our oil & gas in Canada by investigating who is funding all of these protest groups with respect to our industry. Strange Canada is the only target of these groups! I feel our Government tacitly supports them.
6307 2018-04-18 13:42:45 - Apply some castor oil to the stretch marks and gently massage the area in circular motions for 5 to 10 minutes. Wrap the area with a thin, cotton cloth. Using a hot water bottle or heating pad, apply some heat to the affected area for at least a half an hour. Repeat this daily

6318 2018-04-18 13:41:40 Anyone notice how they are playing with these #gas and #oil prices? There is the same quantity of oil as last year or 2 years ago so basically you are now getting robbed without a ski mask

6347 2018-04-18 13:38:53 Why would she hide special access programs on an unsecured server?  If she had advisors technical enough to know how to do that, they'd cover their tracks.  You want two things to be true that mix like oil and water, logically speaking.
6348 2018-04-18 13:38:47 Oil prices fall, revenue falls, so prudent oil dependent governments respond accordingly.
If #UK inflation was approaching 16,000%, would you be blaming it on a slump in oil prices to excuse the present Government? 
No, you would be holding them to account for their incompetence.

6381 2018-04-18 13:35:47 Somebody please tell Mr. Bush we know 911 was a staged false flag demolition hoax, orchestrated by him and his family, that killed alot of innocent people, to justify an invasion of middle eastern countries for their oil and poppy fields. I just don't think he knows we know.
6382 2018-04-18 13:35:39 J. Cramer, "we have abundant of $natgas, sell the related companies" he meant to sell $chk $swn

6385 2018-04-18 13:35:29 Fair point Colin.  I would extend your reasoning to include the fact that many Canadians, not just the Canadians who live in BC, want a safer & more responsible approach to energy that avoids the dirtiest of oil products and promotes cleaner options.

6389 2018-04-18 13:35:13 Sure. All I am saying is that market share is more specific than production. When I was with big oil, we didn't care about marketing pet products in states where we couldn't be #1 or #2. Substantial part of market, therefore, not critical for us based on strategy.
6390 2018-04-18 13:35:07 WTI oil prices pop another 2%, top $68/barrel for the first time since late 2014. Energy stocks $XLE leading the way higher this morning. #OOTT

Is it lipgloss 
What is it
It looks so pretty and sticky 
It’s probably glycerine
6457 2018-04-18 13:29:00 also this is missing a crucial step which is:

Fry garlic in the pan first. THEN when the oil is infused with garlic, take out the actual garlic bits and then fry the pancetta in it.

It is actually a horrible sea pollution, imagine when that much of oil spilled on the sea were equal with 222 tank cars. Yet, seems like not many ppl aware of the dangerous effect that could happen to the ecosystem.

OPEC convenes to examine market situation in June. Both OPEC& non-OPEC producers r unanimous on cuts.

6508 2018-04-18 13:24:40 Educate yourself, BOT! Medieval Putin's Russia has motives behind tens of suspicious deaths globally (a pattern), is waging war on the West with fake propaganda, and invading Ukraine and Syria, killing civilians (illegal) for oil - side with Putin in peril - he cares not for you

6511 2018-04-18 13:24:31 The same oil concerns that are only where they are because #OPEC has the spigot turned off halfway, while the people pay outrageous #gasoline prices as a result. The world is a wash in oil.

6520 2018-04-18 13:23:54 Oil majors current vision 2030 is of peak oil demand, 100+ oil today will accelerate that vision; hence the @IEABirol warning early this week.
6521 2018-04-18 13:23:54 Nice article, Jack. Guess sitting on the board of imperial oil means you don’t care about the environment.
6522 2018-04-18 13:23:50 Sitting in the waiting room while my car gets an oil change. There is a lady at the other end of the room. She sneezes with the most dainty little “achoo” I have ever heard. What good did that even do her?

6526 2018-04-18 13:23:34 Reuters: Saudi Arabia may seek to push crude oil as high as $100/bbl
“Saudi Arabia wants higher oil prices & for  IPO, 

Look at the economic reforms and projects they want to do, and the war in Yemen. How are they going to pay for all that? They need higher prices.”

6533 2018-04-18 13:22:53 The world is bigger than one country. Oil is a global commodity. Just like gold, copper, cocoa, corn, etc.

6538 2018-04-18 13:22:43 So @Dave_Eby is happy to issue court challenges to stop Alberta exporting oil, but has a tantrum when #AbLeg drafts legislation to limit oil exports. Get a grip Dave, enforce the orders already issued by courts, federal government and get #TransMountain built without delay.

6541 2018-04-18 13:21:57 I'm not sure how it will be grown, but large scale farming depends on fertilization, which most often comes from oil byproducts.
6542 2018-04-18 13:21:56 I'm really trying to understand this. America is killing the earth through our carbon based economy. We burn more oil than any one but China. If that's the case why are we green? And why is undeveloped Africa the pit of misery in terms of pollution?
6543 2018-04-18 13:21:50 Aw, I feel so sorry for those big oil companies.
6544 2018-04-18 13:21:46 Average price of a gallon of gas in US was 2.14 for 2016, 2.42 in 2017 and right now has is 2.99 near me. Yes I agree at height has was 3.50 for a few years of Obama's tenure. However the increase instability in the Mideast is cause oil to rise again.
6545 2018-04-18 13:21:40 You under the mistaken belief that I support everything the snp does. I dont. Scotgov dont govern N sea assets or taxes. Successive UKgovs have given massive tax breaks to oil companies & mismanaged the sector for decades. Why has Norway got a huge oil fund & UK has nothing?
6546 2018-04-18 13:21:24 Well, I sure wasn't thinkin' about @SenTedCruz. That man is slimier than a bucket of frogs in baby oil.
6547 2018-04-18 13:21:24 Surely there must be a good reason for oil price not to fluctuate.
Just beyond my comprehension.

6588 2018-04-18 13:17:17 Estoy comprado en petroleras hace bastante. Ahora lo del oil a u$s 100 es por fundamentals. Tenes garantizado los recortes de la opec y no opec. Demanda creciendo a más del 3%. IPO de Aramco y el shale en usa no logra abastecer ese gap.

The oil industry is the largest industry on earth that most people know nothing about.  Petroleum engineering is concerned with the estimation and recovery of oil and natural gas.

6636 2018-04-18 13:13:05 Isn't it always oil? Why the western powers were in the middle East anyway! "Oh let us help you modernise your country" yeah right!
6637 2018-04-18 13:12:53 Today I have to: go to PT, get oil changed, mail excise tax bill, call about cc bill, go to acupuncture, and pick up groceries. Today I WANT TO: lie in bed, snuggle with my cats and watch bad TV. Adulting is dumb.
6638 2018-04-18 13:12:52 Compared to bc? My point (I’ve driven from bc into Alberta many times)  is that they have NO COMPREHENSION of what’s at risk, they don’t care...they see black, thick oil like money money money. Trees? Who cares, land? Who cares, oceans? Who cares...gimme that black oil money.

6652 2018-04-18 13:11:28 I actually believe quite the opposite. Russia's always been a paper tiger, even during the real Cold War. Sure, dumb but reliable weaponry and soldiers, but the rest is Western propaganda about the Boogeyman. The only leverage RU has is natural gas and oil against Europe.

6722 2018-04-18 13:06:07 @POTUS and @VP I paid $2.79 for 1 gallon of gas. Outrageous. When will you regulate gas prices and cap them at no more than $2.00 per gallon. Oil companies will still make billions each year at the $2 cap. How much money do they have to have. Give the American people a break

6740 2018-04-18 13:03:55 This gives the NDP to much power. All they need is a agreement that the flow of oil and fuel will be reduced until the work on the KM TM resumes

6742 2018-04-18 13:03:27 K. Neat idea. Let's workshop it a bit.
The "world needs oil" part stays. That's strong. Bank on it.
Canada being the world's most responsible supplier is far fetched, tho. They're fixing to export the bitumen upgrade process beyond their control & benefit.

Guy who lived in OK (oil dude) spent it on custom racing boats. One NYC guy bought a Maserati, then donated it a year later.

6769 2018-04-18 13:01:36 Snake oil is a fraudulent liniment without snake extract. Currently, it has come to refer to any product with questionable or unverifiable quality or benefit. By extension, a snake oil salesman is someone who knowingly sells fraudulent goods or who is a fraud, quack, or charlatan

6825 2018-04-18 12:55:21 I despise JT but your comment is misleading. He says that he regrets that we can not change everything from one day to the other. That’s a fair comment. I live on and of the oil patch so I need this pipeline. But I’d like for us to do something else, cleaner, eventually.

6959 2018-04-18 12:42:09 Wonder what India and China think about 80-100 prices. Doubt there is any country in the world who can afford to import oil at current prices, let alone at 10-20 bucks higher. Unfortunately we live in markets driven by news fed algos, real world economics do not mattter.

6996 2018-04-18 12:39:21 #oil #oott  The dominoes remind me of 2004.  Oil goes above 40, US interest rates rise.  Oil continues to a high of 145.  World economies slow.  Markets collapse, consumers pull back, oil then plunges.  Greed will kill the markets again. May take 3-4 years but then no hurry.

7033 2018-04-18 12:34:51 Financial info for all our offices is freely available if you look online and there's also loads of info about our various oil campaigns over the years - we oppose extracting fossil fuels full stop, doesn't matter where on the globe  Hope that's clear enough!
7034 2018-04-18 12:34:43 Sure , i prefer coconut oil though 
7035 2018-04-18 12:34:15 Think about..our allies dive into business contracts with Russia, Iran etc. allowing them to export more oil/natgas creating massive cash flows that our adversaries then use to fund their proxies reign of terror that the US in turn spends trillions combating
7036 2018-04-18 12:33:56 Oil was $20 under obj, why were we not buying fuel at 145 or rice at 15k? Price of oil means nothing. Do you know how much we make from gas? It's more than what we make from oil. But this govt won't tell u these facts

7061 2018-04-18 12:31:29 Then they should pay for the pipeline, id like to see us give them a closing date on using our oil, or regulate it till its not worth their time. Its time to be aggressive towards a clean and bright future of abundance

7108 2018-04-18 12:26:55 But because we Canadians are such suckers, the profit is private, but the risk is public.  As always in the oil industry.  And, of course, the risk in this case is greatest in First Nations territories.

7131 2018-04-18 12:24:39 Let's remember that the protests are highly financed by extreme American interest groups who have a lot of money and who are interfering in Canadian internal affairs - ironically while USA fracs oil.  The majority of Canadians want safe pipeline transport.

7194 2018-04-18 12:16:26 Trudeau LISTEN to the WORLD when they tell you to NOT to go ahead with the Kinder Morgan Pipeline! HEAR their voices! Be a LEADER and not a disciple to BIG OIL and Notely!
7195 2018-04-18 12:16:17 I usually do turn the stove on first, then put some olive oil on a pan, and wait a bit, somehow I skipped the first part xD

As for them being done, they aren't that thick, just tenderized steak, not tbone, so they are nearly done already xD
7196 2018-04-18 12:16:14 Salonpas pala muna ang oldies ng oil hahahahaha
7197 2018-04-18 12:16:00 Why don't you stop selling branded products which use palm oil? If major retailers did this it would encourage/force the producers to move away from palm oil.
7198 2018-04-18 12:15:36 Hoped that with Harper gone things in Canada would improve regarding seal his nets and tar oil sands. So disappointing.

7210 2018-04-18 12:14:35 No. Its actually a trade with the right answer dependent upon the future mix of satellite weights. Not a good analogy. You car did not need a truck and crew to park on, new tires, an oil change, new brakes, and a transmission maintenance every time you drove it...
7211 2018-04-18 12:14:26 Waiting at the car dealership for my oil change.....I was here first, at least.

7232 2018-04-18 12:12:13 I think he doesn't know that private companies own the oilfields and extract from them. He probably thinks all the money from oil comes to the state. Doh.
7233 2018-04-18 12:11:58 Oil?
7234 2018-04-18 12:11:53 Even with containers for electrical items, cooking oil and household waste - the recycling plant @ Polmadie was without the means to dispose of emotional baggage. I guess I’ll have to continue processing this through social media channels.
7235 2018-04-18 12:11:53 Food-o-s: if I whizz up a load of wild garlic with some olive oil, will it suffice as a kind of quasi-pesto vegetable dressing, or will I just make a green mess?

7237 2018-04-18 12:11:45 Palm Oil is a wonderful thing but... The way some people grow it is bad. We need to focus on sustainability so our resources don't run out or cause harm to the animals. Sustainable palm oil is great! #palmoilalarmcall #IgniteZoo18 @LearnatCZ
7238 2018-04-18 12:11:39 Oh I get a good amount of crunch on my sauteed potatoes but once I mix them in the bowl with the mayonnaise, the oil from the meat, the wetness of everything, they get kind of sodden and lose the crunch so I'm adding more oil with nothing to gain from it

7243 2018-04-18 12:10:58 Don't be silly. Oil brings in revenue - for the companies that extract it. They have huge expenses to set against profit, and tax was slashed at Swinney's request. Ergo, very little oil money comes to the public purse in the form of taxation.
7244 2018-04-18 12:10:57 You can use the oil things as whiskey and the hot sause as beer

7270 2018-04-18 12:07:22 In some cases capitalism actually did create local dictatorships, usually thru the purchasing of politicians. Thats why I brought up Banana republics, deposing Mossadegh on behalf of oil companies is another example, one that we are still paying for.

7338 2018-04-18 11:57:35 Let me give a small insight. Did you know that the decrease in oil price affected many other countries including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Angola etc. and that Venezuela is in tormoil as we speak and yet to recover. But for Politics sake, we hammer Buhari on everything.
7339 2018-04-18 11:57:30 I don't see demand picking up at higher prices. Oil isn't like index futures. LOL.

7361 2018-04-18 11:54:39 Norway has an economy based on evil oil. The rest of them draft on US protection, and their health care drafts on the US consumer who pays the lions share of the NRE for drug development. You socialist Nirvanas couldn't exist without the US.  Believe me.

7470 2018-04-18 11:41:39 Just like I figured you hypercritical  moron. No oil have ever leaked into the ocean from kinder Morgan and never will. But you have been brain washed to think it will. Sewage is being dumped at unprecedented levels and you say you should do something! Think about it for a sec.

7473 2018-04-18 11:41:16 Everybody chill, the American grilled cheese lives. But one day, when you're feeling a little wild, try a little olive oil instead, and put in a couple thin slices of tomato with cilantro.
7474 2018-04-18 11:41:03 I'm still stuck on "Every human problem can be solved using the bible." If we tried to solve slavery using bible, slavery would be expanded, not ended. What does it say about oil scarcity, nuclear crisis, stem cell, pollution, immigration, science education, & space exploration?
7475 2018-04-18 11:41:02 Would be great to take advantage of helping renewable industries grow. Could get so many jobs from that like other countries but you just want to help oil/coal. Such a loss to us.

7495 2018-04-18 11:38:05 Your friends and family have sense! This GSM/Ice Age is bullshit. A GSM, when and if one happens, will cause 0.3°C cooling compared to 1.2°C warming since 1850. It is the ripest old tosh, told to make some one wealthy. Snake oil, in other words.

We do not refine crude oil and we do not control the security agencies that carry out crude ways of stopping illegal refineries.

7610 2018-04-18 11:15:16 I hope  Tobi’s mum is patiently waiting for her son to pray for him and rub anointing oil all over his body so that the spirit of him calling ceec to even wish her happy birthday will be off his body #BBNaija
7611 2018-04-18 11:14:38 that castor oil still got me fuckeddd uppp
7612 2018-04-18 11:14:32 I screen Virunga, which gets at state capacity, conflict, and oil with a heavy dose of environmental protection
7613 2018-04-18 11:14:22 Your oil on linen paintings are amazing-the vibrancy of the colors-stunning.  I love it all! You are a multitalented lady - from your wonderful “toons” that make me laugh, to your absolutely beautiful paintings-you do it all so well.  TY for sharing!
7614 2018-04-18 11:14:20 A mix of oil and almond milk
7615 2018-04-18 11:14:05 If you CAN, go for extra-virgin oil, cold-pressed olive and virgin or cold-pressed organic coconut oil. Olive oil contains some saturated fat as well as minimal omega-3s and omega-6s. Which is good for you. So I'd recommend olive oil 
7616 2018-04-18 11:13:56 The bastards invade other nations for oil.  I guess it's only fair they destroy such a beautiful place also.

We need a sarcasm font...
7617 2018-04-18 11:13:39 Climate change isn't left or right. It's apolitical.
By this definition all your big pharma conspiracies are LEFT
Denying the POSSIBILITY of climate change makes you a big oil gas and coal sucker

7619 2018-04-18 11:13:39 @JamesGRickards Jim is the pending China Devaluation and Yuan Oil Futures compatible?
7620 2018-04-18 11:13:36 All about oil!
7621 2018-04-18 11:12:51 Precisely....Brent price going up. At current 71 USD/bbl, it's the highest oil price has been in 4 years (I think)
7622 2018-04-18 11:12:33 Because I'm a diabetic and don't like the side effects of metformin, I'm trying Black Seed Oil. Only on day 2 but man can I tell a difference!
7623 2018-04-18 11:12:21 จะว่าพี่ยุ่งก็ได้ค่ะ แต่ว่าะหมายถึงการพิมพ์ของน้อง ไม่ได้หมายถึงการใช้ชีวิตของน้องค่ะ น้องกำลังคุยกับพี่อยู่บนโลกโซเชี่ยลซึ่งเป็นสื่อสาธารณะมีผู้คนเห็นเยอะแยะ น้องจะพิมพ์แบบนี้ไม่ได้นะคะ
7624 2018-04-18 11:12:00 And there we have it folks! Brainwashed into thinking our oil has no revenue. The UK told us it's worthless, so it must be. Norway is just lucky it can count and measure things accurately I suppose.
7625 2018-04-18 11:11:55 Notice... As always,  not men causing deforestation. But its big corporations.  
Then We are blamed. Plus absorb the toxins they create as well as oil spills etc.
Still our footprint is zilch compared to corporate whores.

7660 2018-04-18 11:06:13 $WTI ($oil futures on #NYMEX) stalled its recovery-mode near $ 67.20 region and entered a phase of consolidation, as the bulls await the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) crude stockpiles report for the next push higher.
7661 2018-04-18 11:06:02 Remember my words oh well educated bookworm . Only 3 years from now. Iran will not even attack you . Adel Al Jubeir and Kushners Gang will attack you with Crude Oil to cut you in peace’s. But hey you are sooo well educated I guess you understand this kind of War

7671 2018-04-18 11:04:32 I think he needs to be presented with an indictment for having accepted 8.5 million donation from Russian oil to fund his Super Pacs in the 16 election. Put in jail not given an ankle bracelet.
7672 2018-04-18 11:04:23 Posting what the Mayor has to say on the matter is not helping the issue @KElectricPk - This can only be resolved by either paying your dues to @SSGC_Official  or by using furnace oil, you are a very rich company and can easily afford to instead of putting consumers through this
7673 2018-04-18 11:04:10 On how to come & invest in $15billion oil & gas sector on an economy that insecurity is a major problem. U just keep wasting resources yet we see nor feel no changes. If d people u lead don't enjoy d dividends of democracy.why are u still leading them? 
7674 2018-04-18 11:04:09 I did Nature’s Bounty Hair, Skin & Nail & fish oil after I lost all of the hair on the front of my head after I had a baby. I think it helped speed things up, but could have just been me feeling desperate

7682 2018-04-18 11:03:38 That's why it's important to reconcile the crime of (not once but twice) taking the US into war for big oil profits, give us trillions in debt and gung ho culture that refuses to recognize what gave birth to the terrorism that changed our world forever? For one...

7686 2018-04-18 11:02:34 Justin would rather buy Middle East oil. Ask yourself if he means to intentionally divide & hurt Canada while benefiting personally.When you answer ‘Yes’ most of what he does make sense. He hates Canada but is a globalist puppet egomaniac turning it into a socialist ‘utopia’ IMHO

7755 2018-04-18 10:52:44 Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states are closer and more aligned mentally with Africa, why there are no mass migration to those countries?
The answer is simple, their rulers are wiser & succeeded in buying our leaders with their oil money.

7764 2018-04-18 10:51:48 Now oil prices are also starting to increase which means inflation will increase which means demand, one of the four engines of growth and the only one really working properly will again be tempered after it was badly hit with demo

7769 2018-04-18 10:51:10 I am opposed to another trumped war, seeing as how we are still 15 years later in Iraq, 10 years in Afghanistan, and helping the Saudis murder Yemenis. War is the last option, plus we never leave. I know so many military folks on their 3rd tour and for what? Oil. PTSD for oil.
7770 2018-04-18 10:50:59 Isn't it a bit strange that you let your Saudi allies behead people and torture people, because they support selling their oil in dollars, yet you get PMC's to fabricate Assad's attacks in order to protect financial interests and build public support for military action in Syria?

7773 2018-04-18 10:50:34 Sure. Firstly China is slowing down now because it has reached a stage where it is making the transition from a manufacturing base economy to a service based one. Slow down is natural. Second, India weathered the 2008 crisis brilliantly because of MMS. 
Third, oil prices for Modi
7774 2018-04-18 10:50:28 And you can clearly observe that less oil at higher risk does not benefit anyone. We cannot just drop oil right now, even i would like to, but like it or not, until tech advances (which it is but slowly) we cannot abandon oil. It sustains all of us

Also, we’ve accepted Assad is going to win for 2 years now.

Norway is a smart socialist country with a Trillion dollar reserve due to oil revenue and Alberta has more oil but gives most of the revenue to its American owners. Alberta oil profits US more than Canada! Ah Capitalism! Norway shows Socialism Works!

It doesn't work beyond possibly slowing down casual sharing between friends which is probably something you don't want. You want to slow down the big torrents, where DRM doesn't help.

It also makes things awkward for legit users.

8004 2018-04-18 10:03:18 Don't they use oil these days? So no need for halal certification surely? Same for kosher.
8005 2018-04-18 10:03:14 So that's the equivalent of 2 tanker trucks of oil and 4 trucks of salt water. Obviously no leak is a good leak but it's hardly Deepwater Horizon. By the numbers pipelines are still safer and more environmentally friendly than rail or road shipping.

8028 2018-04-18 09:59:37 Angola has the world's 17th largest crude oil reserves.
8029 2018-04-18 09:59:14 I'm surprised by people's reactions. The last 100-years we have been pumping fossil fuel out of our earth &spewing it into our environment & you don't think this has affected our weather? Our ice caps are melting at alarming rates. Wake up! The only people making $ is the oil co.
8030 2018-04-18 09:59:07 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
Psalm 23:5-6 NIV
8031 2018-04-18 09:58:51 : Use coconut oil when cooking! Yeah it sounds weird, but you won’t even taste the sweet flavor in your dishes :’)

I’ve used coconut oil for frying eggs and roasting vegetables.

Coconut oil converts bad cholesterol into good cholesterol! And yes, it does help you lose fat.
8032 2018-04-18 09:58:51 The attacks on #Syria are about power, money, & oil, not the protection of Syrians. Why does the collective delusion persist? Israel, US, UK, France, Saudi Arabia must immediately cease and desist attacking Syria. These political players are committing crimes against humanity.
8033 2018-04-18 09:58:49 Come meet Clariant #OilServices, the fastest growing supplier of specialty oil field production chemicals to the global #oilandgas industry, at the 2018 SONATRACH ExpoSciences Exhibition in Oran, Algeria this week. Our experts look forward to meeting you at booth A8!
8034 2018-04-18 09:58:46 Canada does not buy oil from Venezuela! We buyoil which is the cheapest in the world to produce and it comes from Saudi Arabia I understand it costs the Saudis about 3$ per barrel to produce!  Go visit Montreal and you will see Free electric charging stations all around the city

8037 2018-04-18 09:58:06 Why is there so much oil in the middle East as compared to other places? Genuine question
8038 2018-04-18 09:57:54 Even better quote from this fireside chat: “Data is not the new oil, it’s nuclear energy. People are stockpiling it” (John Taysom) #AdvertisingAndBeyond

8044 2018-04-18 09:56:40 More chance of an oil tanker turning on Leeds canal than  Lassoga turning in box lol
8045 2018-04-18 09:56:31 Seriously? you want to kill our main exporter that feeds 40million worldwide BEFORE you have anything to replace it? 

Why?

Norway exports Oil ~ should we do more of that?
8046 2018-04-18 09:56:16 Yes, US shale oil is making waves & competing with M.E. oil.
We find US no more plotting Assad's ouster & actually decimating ISIS.
UK's N. Sea oil is running dry. It imports from Norway & OPEC.
France produces 1% of its need, imports the rest.
Both are eyeing Libyan oil.

8051 2018-04-18 09:54:46 There were a lot of external factors that UPA had to deal with then. Like crazy crude oil prices. Modi had huge opportunity to make use of really low crude oil prices. Wasted the opportunity with idiotic demo. We could have been growing much faster.
8052 2018-04-18 09:54:41 This person must, indeed, be swept out of the way, but for about a week until the soap has absorbed the oil.
8053 2018-04-18 09:54:11 My first two cars, back in the 80’s, were Mini’s. 1st was an 850 and the 2nd was a clubman 1000 auto. Was the same colour as Mr Beans Mini  always knew when it was low on oil as it would scream as you went from Park to Drive. Now we have a late 60’s Cooper that I can’t get in
8054 2018-04-18 09:54:11 im in the process of having mine removed, had three sessions. Hurts more than the tattoo, feels a lot like when you're frying oil and it spits at you...but for an extended period of time...

8057 2018-04-18 09:53:13 America had export controls on crude oil since 1974 until very recently,it didn’t turn them into a Venezuelan basket case

8071 2018-04-18 09:51:45 The USA also did it with Vietnam, Iraq and Libya.
The USA regularly lies to justify wars to prop up the economy, control oil reserves and satisfy it’s hegemonic imperialistic fantasies.
8072 2018-04-18 09:51:15 Great episode! Maybe its time to do the Oil searching team? And start after diet building nice plastick art and plant apartaments? Like in last colony?

8076 2018-04-18 09:50:21 Oh, shut the hell up. Your Marxist jargon is pathetic. We've moved on from a failed 19th century economic philosophy in some parts of the globe. You're backward. Be grateful you'll be pushing up shamrock when the oil disappears.

8078 2018-04-18 09:50:15 Input prices gained 4.2 percent from a year earlier in March, driven by higher crude oil costs.The ONS’s house-price gauge showed an annual gain of 4.4 percent in February, down from 4.7 percent in January

8088 2018-04-18 09:47:54 Most likely they will send their troops to where the Kurds are Hence they will control oil. If US leaves the region, Esad Russia will go after saudis. If this was the case US would have chosen Turkey. On the other side US wants to fight the Iranians w/the Kurds with Saudi Money

8097 2018-04-18 09:46:48 Btw one fault with 9/11 truthers: if it was an inside job so we could have an excuse to invade the Middle East to steal oil why not "make" the terrorist Iraqi? Why Saudi, a county we didn't want to invade?

8118 2018-04-18 09:42:06 Romania didn’t fight the UK directly as far as I know but it was a member of the Axis. It was a supplier of oil to the Nazis, had its oilfields bombed by the Americans (no surprises there) and participated militarily in the war against the USSR. I think that’s the point.

8147 2018-04-18 09:36:10 Lol yeah that sums it up pretty much. 

If you want to have a more "stable" crypto, then  you must make a crypto based on a basket of real assets. Like gold, silver, oil, ... similar like the goldbacked dollar was. 

But stability is an illusion in a volatile world.

8235 2018-04-18 09:15:15 Oil was never a bonus in the past where it helped minimise our deficit for many years. Going forward it is only a token and far less important than trade and being part of UK single market.

8274 2018-04-18 09:06:34 At that point the real chaos is unleashed.  Never forget that the Russians can withstand lower oil prices better than any producer.  China is the marginal buyer of Saudi oil and the Saudis are becoming less important to them by the day.

I heard of person hill walking up here who didn't know how to remove them, or that you could, so just put plasters over each tick  Plus all the stories (burn them off, cover in Vaseline or tea tree oil) All they do is make the tick regurgitate, which is just nasty.

8433 2018-04-18 08:34:50 Honestly the best skincare tips are:

 African Black soap/whatever soap works best for you.

I use Bioré nose strips to get rid of blackheads.

If you want a deep cleanse I do the Black peel off mask so it can get the dead skin you don’t see.

Vitamin E oil/Shea butter

8668 2018-04-18 07:43:30 The Canadian oil is in the West, the refineries and consumption in the East. Refineries in the East use lighter crude oils, plus pipeline (Energy east for example) would be extremely expensive.

9034 2018-04-18 06:28:12 If you only run light crude in a complex refinery throughput is only around 50% of plate. So in theory refineries would invest.

9090 2018-04-18 06:17:56 We can NEVER advance as a nation UNTIL we place the highest VALUE  on human lives, not oil or other revenue. When I see Benue, Nassarawa, Borno, Taraba trending these days, UNFORTUNATELY it always mean one thing, the HOLIEST of human rights has been grossly abused AGAIN.

9092 2018-04-18 06:16:53 Anyone with a brain realizes we are going to be somewhat dependent on non renewable resources ( OIL ) for 50 more years. Some of the sceientists who deny this are completely misleading the public.

9098 2018-04-18 06:16:11 GOVERNMENT SHOULD STOP COLLECTING FINES FROM OIL COMPANIES FOR GAS FLARING.THE FINES COLLECTED FROM OIL COMPANIES IS LIKE ASKING THE COMPANIES TO PAY DEATH FEES FOR THE CITIZENS WHO WILL DIE IN FUTURE FROM ENORMOUS HEALTH  EFFECTS FROM GAS FLARING
9099 2018-04-18 06:15:57 Fact. Bts came from a very small company in Korea. They were poor, they self promoted, they used suite cases as tables, they ate bread with oil from a tuna can because they couldn't afford food. But despite all of that, they became one of the biggest most successful kpop groups.
9100 2018-04-18 06:15:38 I much prefer to use trains because they run on electricity, not oil; they run on a separate network avoiding traffic, which means they are faster and more reliable (actually on time); and because they are bigger and can carry more passengers.
9101 2018-04-18 06:15:22 The problem with nat gas is fracking & fugitive emissions. As for rail, pick your poison is not an acceptable position. The risk from the expanded tank farm, 3 new berths and traffic, 60 tankers/yr to >400/yr will occur no matter how the oil arrives. Time to transition not expand
9102 2018-04-18 06:15:19 Normally banyak yg water based unless ada oil ingredients. Yang ni lightweight texture, gel almost like essence
9103 2018-04-18 06:15:12 I remember a publisher who wanted to quietly discuss high discounting and special sales with you. 
Publishers don’t like it when we make this info public. They monitor our tweets and get cross. Free speech and publishing do t always mix well, like oil on water.

9224 2018-04-18 05:51:51 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
9225 2018-04-18 05:51:29 Remember Atlantic current of warm water is at 1600 year low? Well not much human activity back then, this is complete nonsense story, Climate change people are without common sense, Climate Barbwired is pushing coal and oil as example imo
9226 2018-04-18 05:51:27 USD CAD -  wave 5 after finishing it, get ready for the correction - it's possible that it will coincide with the correction on OIL

How far and fast expansion into green power and infrastructure should go is fraught with risk

9242 2018-04-18 05:49:10 I don't believe we will run out of oil in your lifetime or the pipeline lifetime.  We may slow our consumption by replacement technology.  But so far except for nuclear all replacement technology consumes more energy to be productive than it produces.
9243 2018-04-18 05:48:54 the oil on my face could end any war

9254 2018-04-18 05:45:56 Also no reason for big oil to do this since they/we have been and continue to be allowed to burn fossil fuels unabated. No reason for them to take on such extra cost/hassle at this scale.

9265 2018-04-18 05:43:08 No, we do not want to give any government, socialist or any other, the power and authority to limit and control the export of any product, let alone oil and gas. The Canadian Wheat Board kept farmers from getting a fair price for decades; this Bill is no good!

9270 2018-04-18 05:42:00 But you have to consider the source of the risk and that's to sell oil to Asia. Is making a quick buck selling oil to Asia worth the risks, worth tearing confederation apart for, having Provinces and citizens a war with each other, increasing the debt to buy into #KM, FN issues?

9274 2018-04-18 05:41:21 Emma, give your head a shake. Where do you think most of your Alberta standard of living comes from?  Oil pays your way. It puts money in your pocket. And food in your mouth.  No oil, no job for Emma. Have you made that connection?
9275 2018-04-18 05:41:19 Im not industry, but it’s because NZ policy not binding on other countries, and NZ is small. So production will just shift elsewhere 1:1. Meeting that 20% target via supply side rules will require multilateral agreements incl big oil producers.
9276 2018-04-18 05:41:04 3) 
- Saudi moved from crude oil to refined oil supplier in last 10 years. They hv cut down refined oil imports from India. 
- Precious stones markets across world saturating
- Automobiles not a growing market
- Textiles not a growing market
So, our exports not growing.
9277 2018-04-18 05:40:43 OK. Let me help.
Wash the leaves thoroughly-under running water if possible.
Slice the leaves thinly.
Heat some cooking oil in a pot.
Add the leaves. Let them cook for about 5 minutes.
Add salt to taste
Add peanut butter if desired.

9290 2018-04-18 05:38:25 Would also add KSA to that list. We have allowed them to spread Wahabism and violent repression all over the globe so we could get our hands on their oil. Who needs enemies w friends like Turkey and KSA.

9295 2018-04-18 05:37:36 2) Now lets find out why India's exports are not growing. For that lets see the biggest contributors of India's exports
1) Refined oil (petroleum)
2) Precious stones/gems
3) Automobiles
4) Pharma
5) Textiles
So, exports r not growing 'cause some of above 5 are tanking.Which ones?

9364 2018-04-18 05:24:48 Feels so good to come home, change into my pajamas, take my make up off, wash my face, put tea tree oil on and feeling how soft my face is, using my hand scrub, brushing my teeth, eye drops, chapstick then perfume and then laying down. I’m a beautiful fresh princess 
9365 2018-04-18 05:24:31 DREAM PHONE??? Also FUCK I love you so much pls tell me Yugi joins them and they pull the funniest shit out from this game like bad jokes about motor oil as lube and insane altar egos (nod to s0)

9371 2018-04-18 05:23:36 Like an EPA Director that makes sure those Oil Wells are pump'n, and the Natural Gas Frickers are "Fracking?" I think not. Something up. The CIA doesn't do Diplomacy with North Korea. Weird. 
9372 2018-04-18 05:23:36 Yes, after years of success on the pitch we were able to raise funds to secure top players.  Remind me, what did City win before the oil money flowed in?  That’s my point
9373 2018-04-18 05:23:33 Coconut oil is really good for dogs though. If they have itchy skin, you could put it on where they are itchy, or just put some in their food and it helps. And if they have open wounds, putting coconut oil on it will help it heal faster.
9374 2018-04-18 05:23:04 I think Santiago uses his salt lamp and oil diffuser more than I use mine.
9375 2018-04-18 05:22:51 @DavidVenableQVC I just love love your cooking shows, what I would love 2 C is good Olive oil offered, Italian,Greek, etc, just like wine,
9376 2018-04-18 05:22:25 Awesome! This is one pan pasta super easy:
Add ingredients into pan (pasta, cherry tomato, basil, spinach, garlic, onion, salt, red pepper, pepper, bacon(optional))
Add good amount of oil
Add water
Cook until water boils down (med) and becomes sauce
Add parmesan to thicken sauce!
9377 2018-04-18 05:22:15 Reading a journal that I used to write in. Actual quote: 

“...he was only in my life for a short time, and I truly don’t think I’ll remember these memories fondly. Anyway I’m gonna make a grocery list now: 
• eggs 
• olive oil 
• rotisserie chicken”
9378 2018-04-18 05:22:00 For my dog - adopted, indie crossed with terrier we later learnt - with frequent skin issues, I use coconut oil infused with neem or lavender oil. First concoction keeps off ticks (100% tick and flea free), second keeps skin in good condition and dog smells like a scented cushion
9379 2018-04-18 05:21:49 They have destroyed every single Government organization. Except for a few limping on government sops like RCF / BEML or  monopolies like oil marketing companies they have run all aground. It's a graveyard out there. Killing fields.

9388 2018-04-18 05:20:28 So I learned that it's bad to use coconut oil in your hair. So don't use coconut oil other then cooking please.
9389 2018-04-18 05:20:26 It’s hard to believe I’ve been gone 3 years already & this is still waiting to get into formal policy.

9392 2018-04-18 05:19:58 I find that Saskatchewan backing Alberta in this a bit surprising. 200,000 litres of oil leaked into the North Saskatchewan River. Contaminated the water supply... They are still trying to clean it up.... and they think that BC is not worried about the same thing?
9393 2018-04-18 05:19:54 The US will be the largest exporter of oil in a few years . What do you think the pipeline is about ?
9394 2018-04-18 05:19:31 perhaps islamists r using their oil money to get that done

9402 2018-04-18 05:18:03 82 oil spills in 57 yrs .. triple the number of spills, or possibly MORE considering the age of the pipeline in total & the environment, communities, drinking water, marine & wildlife will be destroyed. time to  change for a clean planet SAFE for everyone & everything ...

9413 2018-04-18 05:17:12 My mom knows that I'm afraid of oil splattering yet she just asked me to cook some greasy spam I'm shaking
9414 2018-04-18 05:17:08 I'd like to sell all the oil we can while it's still valuable, but because of the failure of NIF, delays at ITER, and reluctance to embrace Gen 4 fission, oil is going to be valuable for at least the next 25 years and likely to the service life end of any new pipeline built today
9415 2018-04-18 05:16:57 Most of us wish we can get off the oil as quickly as possible because it is a dying business it's too bad we can't do it easily  just like the coal industry. This is from a man who has been working in this oil and gas industry for the last twenty years in Calgary.

9427 2018-04-18 05:15:47 Well, you asked what I was on. So I showed you. The peak oil situation is nothing to play with. That's why I am "on" this proverbial substance that you claim. Which is quite simply, knowledge. I'm high on facts and information.
9428 2018-04-18 05:15:38 Ruble will rise. Same as the price of oil. It is inevitable. US WTI benchmark will mean very little very soon. Brent might mean something for a while. But we all know which way things are going.

1. It involved Israel so we would send troops to ME keep Arab nations off their back big brother US would be in the neighborhood
2. Big oil $ so we could control the flow of oil
3. And yes so we (CIA) could get into Afghanistan and control/profit from the poppy production.

9467 2018-04-18 05:08:38 They crow about it "creating so many jobs".

But those jobs cost money. Far, far more money than coal or oil or natural gas.
9468 2018-04-18 05:08:32 That orange oil stuff will fix all your damaged pairs. Or so I have learnt after letting the kids use all the scissors.
9469 2018-04-18 05:08:17 Rubbing lavender oil on your feet and smelling it before bed can also help you sleep (:
9470 2018-04-18 05:08:09 I was finally able to get some Lemonine delivered here after months of fighting with shipping. It is basically orange oil and concentrated ascorbic acid and for some reason, they classified it as a toxic solvent instead of a natural cleaner so they would only allow pickup.
9471 2018-04-18 05:08:03 Want to talk about #Syria?  Ok...so there were these things called dinosaurs.  When they died, they turned into oil somehow.  And that's what your car uses for food.
9472 2018-04-18 05:08:01 Industry deserves to understand this policy. It wasn't in Lab/NZF manifestos. In the Campaign, Guyon Espiner asked Ardern “Will you commit to the Green  idea of no new deep sea oil and gas drilling?” To which she answered “No.” Doesn't sound like a reasonable democratic process.

9484 2018-04-18 05:06:35 What's wrong with moving away from oil?  If we could replace all jobs, all revenue, taxes, etc and everything was equal, just different energy and fuel source would you be down to change?
9485 2018-04-18 05:06:10 Because  .....they have fk loads of oil and buying weapons. It's that sick
9486 2018-04-18 05:05:54 Coconut oil is the BEST!

9625 2018-04-18 04:42:17 I wish this dorm maintenance team to get their shit together. Last week it was so hot in my room my 2 liter jar of coconut oil fully melted. This week, it’s so cold I gotta sleep in two hoodies and two pair of pants smh. 

I can’t live like this anymore.
9626 2018-04-18 04:42:10 Will be cancelling our camping reservations in BC and going to Saskatchewan instead. BC can't possibly want our "dirty" oil money spent in their province, do they?
9627 2018-04-18 04:42:07 I’m convinced I found a skincare routine that works for me. And it includes rosehip oil lol
9628 2018-04-18 04:41:47 Rosehip oil is life.
9629 2018-04-18 04:41:43 Just talking about the Raptors game...completely different animal.
9630 2018-04-18 04:41:36 Selling a product that nobody wants and doesn't work is what snake oil salesmen do. "Evangelical" is a buzzword, but there's plenty of people who'll evangelize to you for free, and only when wanted/desired.

9637 2018-04-18 04:40:22 Security agents take note,people should retweet my tweets until it gets to the right autorities. Some group of armed boys are about to launch a major attack at mguoshimini oro-akwor community,the host community agip oil company in rumueme.

9640 2018-04-18 04:39:54 I'm no fan of veg oil, but this chart is severely flawed.  vegetable oil should be going up before heart disease and this chart clearly shows another un-charted variable is at play - try introducing sugar to the graph!
9641 2018-04-18 04:39:50 Yes indeed messed times. But not new. Please study the origins of Syria regime change project for oil, gas, water, land, Golan, regional power.
9642 2018-04-18 04:39:47 Maybe you should go protest on the new bridge that was approved in Richmond that allows visitors view oil tankers unload fuel. You know, the same one that was approved by the provincial government, city coun and NEB.

9647 2018-04-18 04:39:05 I was talking about the slanderous comments on left leaning beliefs. I can appreciate where oil has brought us economically, that being said, the disadvantages outway the advantages.
9648 2018-04-18 04:38:46 i bought an essential oil diffuser it’s over for you hoes
9649 2018-04-18 04:38:26 That's a well oiled machine you got there @realDonaldTrump  Unfortunately there's a sign on it that says Do Not Oil.
9650 2018-04-18 04:38:14 @egirrrlie have you any leads off hand for @MichaelWestBiz to look at Murdoch’s shale oil in Syria...?
9651 2018-04-18 04:37:53 I got Habs first, Sens second, Oil third.  And honestly I think I'd be ok with that (especially as it could well mean that the Oilers get Svechnikov)!  
9652 2018-04-18 04:37:48 Comey on Colbert calling for an uprising of American values.

9654 2018-04-18 04:37:26 Before every hair cut , the cutter must switch his machine on and let it run for a second in spirits or lamp oil ,, to insure the client his cutting machine is clean
9655 2018-04-18 04:37:19 Ok yes re current oil price etc. Altho  discount price is not applied as a CC cost - merely the standard Tsy discount rate. I take your overall point, but still seems to be a pretty crude approximation of cost.
9656 2018-04-18 04:37:16 I use the curl and shine shampoo and conditioner. And I use the Jamaican black castor oil Hair smoothie. That Jamaican smoothie smells kinda weird but works wonders
9657 2018-04-18 04:37:13 Alberta’s had an average of two crude oil spills a day, every day for the past 37 years.  The majority of British Columbians do not consent to the KM pipeline.
9658 2018-04-18 04:37:09 Looks like I’ll be wearing Fenty Lingerie and sparkly body oil for myself this summer 
9659 2018-04-18 04:37:09 But she still has a job, so they must not be too concerned
9660 2018-04-18 04:36:39 ไม่ค่า
9661 2018-04-18 04:36:27 Most of what you produce is not used in B.C. It is shipped to the US and Asia. And it’s not useable anyway because it’s Bitumen, not oil. BC gets most of our oil from Washington
9662 2018-04-18 04:36:14 essential oil but new car scented
9663 2018-04-18 04:35:53 Why use modified palm oil? Why not write on your labels that the palm oil you use is 100% RSPO certified?
9664 2018-04-18 04:35:47 When she extra virgin olive oil 
9665 2018-04-18 04:35:17 There is literally no business sense in exporting oil to no buyers.

9667 2018-04-18 04:34:45 Pardon me, I have to open another 50 gallon drum of Oil of Olay.
9668 2018-04-18 04:34:30 .@PhilCoastGuard1 spox Balilo says they would also check on the safety procedures on how they transfer petroleum oil to Boracay Island, such as if it could lead to an oil spill.@PhilippineStar

9670 2018-04-18 04:33:42 recommendation: buy cheap stuff (E.L.F) and go crazy watching tutorials and learn with the cheap stuff.

also a good oil cleaner is worth its weight in gold -- see Korean beauty blogs for it. I think I use clean it zero. Makeup instantly gone and your pillow stays clean :P
9671 2018-04-18 04:33:22 Read but not convinced. Just a different way of saying Alberta oil sucks and no one wants it. Really? 3 million barrels a day and growing.
9672 2018-04-18 04:33:12 Ok bike is back together. Just need oil change and a good cleaning and I am ready to go
9673 2018-04-18 04:32:52 Read but not convinced. Just a different way of saying Alberta oil sucks and no one wants it. Really? 3 million barrels a day and growing.
9674 2018-04-18 04:32:52 Ahhh, that’s why I heard Imperial Oil, Royal Dutch Shell, BP, Exxon, etc. start to say they want out of this whole oil business 
9675 2018-04-18 04:32:49 Because the US likes the Saudis and they have oil.
9676 2018-04-18 04:32:34 We gotta stop being fucking stupid and take advantage of clean energy haha. All these greedy-ass companies want us to keep using oil so they can keep making money. Trash bro. We aren’t a species meant to survive.
9677 2018-04-18 04:32:32 Jojoba oil has helped me, it’s not an oil it’s more of wax but idk research it I could go on about it, I used this acne thing that dried tf out of my skin and jojoba oil has helped a lot

9685 2018-04-18 04:31:35 Turdeau will be phased out sooner that our oil industries! Problem: phasing out is taking too much time!
9686 2018-04-18 04:31:34 It's not anti oil either.
9687 2018-04-18 04:31:23 So????
9688 2018-04-18 04:31:08 We already know the idiot’s life; he was born to a nymphomaniac, pot smoking, mental ward mother, spoiled by narcissistic daddy’s $, (made by oil), and a complete failure as far as education goes.

9695 2018-04-18 04:30:33 Believe it or not Mr Adler there is such a thing called peak oil. No way around it.  Although it's hard to do now the world will require a contingency plan preferably sooner then later
9696 2018-04-18 04:30:18 1. At first I thought the same #verge but we know porn industry is one of the bigstakes like oil and guns. From my view insteed they paid raised money they move right. A. Its a victory from a crypto against fiat to a big site with a lot of traffic as a paid method. B. We dont
9697 2018-04-18 04:30:16 But is the practitioner selling snake oil not also legally liable? They prey on fears and offer rainbows. If they cause a death/ disability because of their treatment - why are they not liable?
9698 2018-04-18 04:30:06 Its not championing it. Its explaining that Canadian ports can't compete, which kills the business case for selling oil abroad using conventional Canada-Canada pipelines.
9699 2018-04-18 04:29:59 泣いた
9700 2018-04-18 04:29:58 You have to supply you own boiling hot oil! 
9701 2018-04-18 04:29:49 I put my hair in four puffballs and tie it down every night before I lay down, then I massage oil into it when I wake up in the morning. What do you like to do for yourself to exhibit self-love?
9702 2018-04-18 04:29:46 My ancestors didn’t steal anything, and whites in general paid for the oil, as you would know if you were capable of reading something more complicated than Wheaties packets.

9707 2018-04-18 04:28:26 How bout boycotting mines who produce ore that goes into gun metal, and oil production for the lubrication used in guns and the plastic parts used in guns. Throw in shipping and trucking industry for transporting guns from factory to store...where does it end with the boycotts?
9708 2018-04-18 04:27:41 3) haven’t these people had enough? Look at their cities and towns. OMG who can live there? And we are still bombing them? Why? OIL? Shit on it. Sooner or later, we will not need it. It will become obsolete. Then what will we do with it? Grease up our door hinges with it?
9709 2018-04-18 04:27:39 i finally bought a oil diffuser today and it’s amazing 
9710 2018-04-18 04:27:25 Wouldn't be surprised if some homes or maybe oil equipment "erupted" when the fire raced past.
9711 2018-04-18 04:27:18 Oil companies pay taxes. Oilfield service companies pay taxes. Oilfield employees pay taxes. Erm.... I’d explain more but a waffle would soak it up faster.... waffles go good with trolls.
9712 2018-04-18 04:26:58 WHAT WHAT? Dream on little dreamer. Do you really think that we look for oil because it's the easy way out?
9713 2018-04-18 04:26:49 Mason: yeah my parents hate Ford.

Me: why? My family loves Ford.

Mason: because they had to deal with my transmission blowing up..
But I also didn’t change my oil after 6 months of it needing changed.. I’m gay I don’t know these things.

9720 2018-04-18 04:25:23 Do t forget to dumb it down for those people to show that the 100,000 litres of oil is equivalent to ~625 barrels of oil. Not saying it’s good... but your eco alarmists can rest easy
9721 2018-04-18 04:24:57 Yeah!  Then people will have to use less expensive things to kill like knives, gasoline, vehicles, fertilizer n fuel oil.
9722 2018-04-18 04:24:55 "Pharma pigs" is your term. I, too, have had many formal hours of education in healthcare. I am not an uneducated conspiracy theorist. Big pharma is big money, like big oil and our food producers. They are in it for profits. Period.
9723 2018-04-18 04:24:38 You should get a big lighter or oil lamp to put on your coffee table at home and get a big box full of books of matches and keep it in your car.
9724 2018-04-18 04:24:32 What the hell, I'm a retired Commercial Insurance specialist and me with my felt peak cap will go head to head with Ryan Zinke. I figure my common sense can top his bluster!

9730 2018-04-18 04:23:56 One time I accidentally spilled motor oil all over my trunk.
Then shortly after that I spilled kitty litter all over it.
It was two wrongs that made a right bc the litter cleaned up the oil and I was able to just scoop it out.
9731 2018-04-18 04:23:52 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.

9736 2018-04-18 04:22:55 Next logical steps: banning use of peat for heating, ban of oil. And strict criteria for the sustainability of biofuels that will replace them.
9737 2018-04-18 04:22:44 It’s so hot inside my house my coconut oil melted 
9738 2018-04-18 04:22:38 All fair points. It's unfortunate there hasn't been the same political will to advance clean energy as there has been to appease the oil industry. Signs of hope with the recent boost in science related funding and the end of the Harper era. Hope we get it right next election 
9739 2018-04-18 04:22:36 Instead of fighting against Alberta British Columbians interested in #StopKM should work on what is in their provinces control and ban all oil tankers from BC coasts, better if they can get cargo ships banned too. But that would affect the BC economy and their own wallets
9740 2018-04-18 04:22:20 Spent an hour trying to oil the treadmill belt. I think that counts enough.
9741 2018-04-18 04:22:17 Pouring oil on the fire is not the way to quench it.
9742 2018-04-18 04:22:10 Trust me. I majored with Oil paints I know the risks. Who'dya THUNK I AM Picasso????
9743 2018-04-18 04:22:06 Lmao, honest answer. Over 300’000 bbls a day of Alberta oil head west, of this, gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, light crude, heavy and synthetic crude. Supplies all of BCs only refinery and all of Vancouver’s jet fuel, the leftover then ties into pipelines that head to Seattle,

9748 2018-04-18 04:20:49 My funeral plans? Seriously, nothing fancy. Just a small thing... drizzle some olive oil on me. Use a good olive oil... squeeze of lemon & some black pepper — honestly, it doesn’t have to be anything more complicated than that.
9749 2018-04-18 04:20:33 It's easy to give money to people, even if it is counterproductive policy. If renewables really take off, lots of stranded oil and natural gas investments, so let's encourage those!
9750 2018-04-18 04:20:32 Keep some good fats in your diet. Almonds, walnuts, olive oil, and avocado.
9751 2018-04-18 04:20:29 Thats what people in BC want. Less oil. Less oil products. More alternatives. Now they will be relatively cheaper and viable options
9752 2018-04-18 04:20:06 How does exporting our resources so we can import from other places make sense? Why not build a refinery, keep our own damn oil AND all the jobs?

9757 2018-04-18 04:19:32 i also love when i talk about how falling EROI makes switching to any alternative power after peak oil extremely difficult, and they just say "nah i'm not worried"
9758 2018-04-18 04:19:31 Priceless!
9759 2018-04-18 04:19:25 Look what happen when Paul Foley was ambassador for Timor-Leste, the bugging of an East Timor cabinet office during negotiations over an oil and gas treaty worth an estimated $40 billion.
9760 2018-04-18 04:19:23 It mentioned liver damage.... this is NOT a side effect of CBD oil that's for sure.
9761 2018-04-18 04:19:23 The LOOP cannot ship oil via VLCC to Asia.  The ships don't fit through the Panama Canal.   No commercial shipping takes the route around Cape Horn due to the severe seas, and it is a LONG trip even if you transit the Strait of Magellan
9762 2018-04-18 04:19:10 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
9763 2018-04-18 04:18:55 we need clean green power to compete in the future ... selling out America to oil barons and sheiks is despicable ... putting America first is a priority and both parties seem to forget that in different ways

9765 2018-04-18 04:18:45 Strange how the article fails to mention that the NEB review, completed in May 2016 (*after* oil prices fell) considered whether or not there would be demand for the pipeline. 

Also strange how there’s no mention that producers have contracted for the capacity of TMX.
9766 2018-04-18 04:18:28 If corn oil comes from corn, where does baby oil come from?
9767 2018-04-18 04:18:28 @StpMkt @Ch2Christo @Hubon Oil going to test $73.65 as Iran sanction draws near and ABF continues to strike Syria, with aid from SA. Once breech, next limit is $74.82.

9769 2018-04-18 04:18:15 But initiative on agriculture is also part of activation of economy. Our economy is so much dependent on oil

9771 2018-04-18 04:18:08 I love putting coconut oil in my bath water ..
9772 2018-04-18 04:18:05 Go camp out at the St Lawrence & watch the tankers bring in that foreign Saudi & US oil all day. You won’t see oil spills, but you will see raw sewage floating along. 
9773 2018-04-18 04:17:52 I hear you. It's all a matter of perception. A big reason why it's so challenging for a small family business to take on what the world imposes as their idea of 'safety', as a flow on effect from industries like mining, oil and gas etc.
9774 2018-04-18 04:17:40 What boycott?

9784 2018-04-18 04:14:37 $25,000 for a year's worth of CBD oil to help sick kids? The pharmaceutical industry can rot in hell.
9785 2018-04-18 04:14:34 There are a lot of resources online for finding nutritious foods and still hitting your macros. You gotta find what you like though; chicken and turkey is easy lean protein; pasta, rice and potatoes for CHO's; adding olive oil to cooking and nuts for fat. Just some examples
9786 2018-04-18 04:14:30 Interesting that championing a Texas oil export terminal over a Cdn oil export terminal is good, but AB, SK and Cda supporting "Texas-based" Kinder Morgan is bad #bcpoli
9787 2018-04-18 04:14:11 In Trump's America the coal industry has been undercut by renewables. But in Trumpland it's macho to dig for coal & drill oil, while wind & solar are "poncy lavender treehugger" stuff.

9792 2018-04-18 04:13:18 Even the recent Shell plan followed closely with the scientific consensus. I think if a major oil empire is agreeing with the models than you should take it seriously.
9793 2018-04-18 04:13:17 I've never heard of those. I'll look into them! Its driving me nuts. I lost my oil blotting paper i feel like i need to use a bunch of them right now.
9794 2018-04-18 04:13:16 The Liberals killed off two major pipeline projects and passed one (not to mention other smaller projects). If they were bought off by Big Oil then #1. He would've been a lot more strict about handling this provincial battle and #2. There would be two additional pipelines built.
9795 2018-04-18 04:13:07 - So you're a Canadian citizen who supports pollution, profits for Texas oil companies propped up with Canadian tax dollars and the Canadian military if necessary. Got it.

9811 2018-04-18 04:10:33 We need both demand AND supply side policies to reduce emissions, and making it harder to access heavy oil deposits that are landlocked in Canada is one way to put pressure on the supply side.

9857 2018-04-18 04:03:54 Sad that ppl behave in this manner. This isn’t a fight about the environment we are the most ethical oil producers globally.not about money it’s about ppl living and eating. Those that appose the pipeline simply need to inform themselves as to how all CNDs benefit including them
9858 2018-04-18 04:03:52 I can’t do coconut oil. The texture is weird for me to touch lol!
9859 2018-04-18 04:03:50 So @realDonaldTrump says that he has no part in his businesses anymore but it is becoming pretty obvious that all the pictures of these visits are just wide money shots of Mar a lago. Fn crook and snake oil seller.

9866 2018-04-18 04:02:37 Nah, Shell only left b/c of NDP gov't. Oil demand increases 30% by 2040 and oil sands have nearly unlimited deposits.
9867 2018-04-18 04:02:29 Who said that ?? Maybe but I never heard that. Wasn't my experience.  my edges fell out for the first time. I had 2 BALD SPOTS at my hairline. I was rubbing that castor oil like every hour & started biotin n prenatals. Got my edges back

9897 2018-04-18 03:57:39 Is that like the oil eating enzyme the put in the gulf after the BP oil rig exploded; because now we have skin eating bacteria in the gulf. Maybe we should just get a few large freighters out there to become portable recycle centers funded by soros.

9905 2018-04-18 03:56:46 The news article is lying. Oil prices are currently on an uptrend. You do not judge a market's movement by its last 3 days. Only a moron would do that and that's exactly what they reported.

9909 2018-04-18 03:56:25 I tried to cut on oil usage. Setakat ni berjaya semua dry fry. Mula2 susah lah, telur goreng pun tak sedap tp now dah biasa, telur goreng kedai pulak tak best, byk minyak.

9913 2018-04-18 03:55:18 You using Lucian castor oil?
9914 2018-04-18 03:55:16 Because they produce oil which runs your cars and your industries. Only money speaks.

9918 2018-04-18 03:54:51 try scalp massages it helped me a lot with the itchiness and also mix water, peppermint oil, tea tree oil and ACV in a bottle and spray your scalp that also helped a lot
9919 2018-04-18 03:54:42 KM has every right to build the pipeline. It was approved by NEB and Trudeau. You also fail to realize how much funding from the government comes from oil. Perhaps Canada should limit funding to BC then?
9920 2018-04-18 03:54:38 I sure hope this isn't for his time as premier, investing all the money in natural resources when oil was well priced was all well in good but he had nothing to show when we could no longer depend on oil profits.
9921 2018-04-18 03:54:19 Crack is illegal you moron, not to mention the real damage it does to people.
Oil is our society's lifeblood - NOTHING will function without. No food, medicine, heat, clothes. Nothing.

9926 2018-04-18 03:53:15 Ese proceso de casi un año se suele dar con volumen X4 y suba de aprox. 50%, obvio dependiendo del país en si.. cuando hablan de baja es luego de implementado y es erróneo también. Qatar y EAU sufrieron el oil de 100 a 25 USD eso es contextualizar

9940 2018-04-18 03:51:46 @JustinTrudeau, it seems, is owned by big oil.
9941 2018-04-18 03:51:45 Someone this terrified of being murdered intends to be a REALLY hated public official! Like putting oil wells on playgrounds hated.
9942 2018-04-18 03:51:43 There will always be risks to transporting oil. There are risks with natural gas lines too. Countless documented explosions and deaths from natural gas accidents. But it’s an essential energy source so we don’t stop using it. Just try to make it safer. Pipelines safer than rail

9944 2018-04-18 03:51:38 It's always been about the Oil or Land & Power Jude! My husband rarely talked about Vietnam after he returned except when he spoke of the rotten US Politicians! Trump isn't A Warmonger & Putin Isn't Ready To Meet his Maker! We're supplying Oil now Jude & it's problematic to Putin
9945 2018-04-18 03:51:29 Yea you will. It's so easy. I used witch hazel, the coconut oil that stays liquid, tsp of castor oil soap, and a few drops of a nice essential oil. You need very little of each, plus boiled or distilled water. And i use viva brand paper towels. :)
9946 2018-04-18 03:51:24 Hopefully @SouthwestAir didn’t drop my luggage in an oil puddle on this flight.
9947 2018-04-18 03:51:23 #climatechange The other question is Why get off oil? Unless of course a more economic option should be developed, in which case the marketplace will decide. Forget the CO2 excuse. That is and always was a lie.
9948 2018-04-18 03:51:22 That cop didn't land one punch or shoot the guy? Clearly police training tactics only kick in when they smell coconut oil
9949 2018-04-18 03:51:22 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
9950 2018-04-18 03:51:17 I guess it would be asking too much for our hard earned taxes be spent on extensive equipment and personnel to be on the West Coast to ensure a QUICK response to any oil spill instead of sending it to DICTATORS in Africa for gender studies. Psst - Money goes to the Dictator.
9951 2018-04-18 03:51:01 I’ve heard of it! I’ve been using vitamin e oil but I’m definitely gonna try that one! Thank you 
9952 2018-04-18 03:51:00 I feel like my car loves oil so much it just can’t get enough of it. Like a kid wanting to eat all of her Halloween candy in one night. FML 
9953 2018-04-18 03:50:56 Do you like lime? Once almost cooked through fry them with a little oil, some cut up pancetta, and the juice from two limes. Saute on hi for 1-2 minutes, stirring and mixing. S&P to taste.

9965 2018-04-18 03:49:13 I had to learn to be okay being alone far before my partner moved out of “our” home. This isn’t the worst part most days. The worst part is when a “check” Light comes on in my car & I know he’d know why. The worst part is knowing he won’t be there to change my oil.
9966 2018-04-18 03:49:02 President Trump we really need the Oil Field to pick back up here in Farmington NM....lots of our husbands have been laid off here 
9967 2018-04-18 03:48:53 you ever accidentally spill your cold-pressed rose hip oil all over your new sweatshirt that's hand drawn by a band's frontman/banjo player and just...reevaluate...
9968 2018-04-18 03:48:49 Great article. Simple, yet 'nailed it' turns of phrase,  ie "an oil change" - a well crafted glimpse of being there -  really liked "When you learn something that doesn’t change, you can step off the treadmill of keeping up and start to compound your knowledge. " - loved it.
9969 2018-04-18 03:48:39 "The purpose of this chapter is to insure that, because of the extensive governmental studies already made of this project and the national interest in early delivery of North Slope oil to domestic markets, the trans-Alaska oil pipeline be constructed promptly" 5/6 #stopKM
9970 2018-04-18 03:48:37 I have a diffuser thingy for my car and I put lavender oil on it, it helps on my way to work
9971 2018-04-18 03:48:24 Has he, now? When all that water is actually in place, let's talk. 

Now, between the tax credits & subsidies already given to the oil co.s & never mind what he's promised, we are looking at far more than $5,8 billion already handed to those oil crooks.

9975 2018-04-18 03:48:12 I’m in the bath covered in flower petals, lavender and essential oil and honestly don’t feel like I’m on earth.
9976 2018-04-18 03:48:01 C'est vrais, mais vrais. Off oil is a 40-year process plus, not 40 days and 40 nights.
It's why @TransMtn expansion CAN be part of an overall off-oil direction,
Remember vast Canada will need petrol motive fuel for many decades to come.
And cold Canada will need winter heating.

9993 2018-04-18 03:46:11 The trains will come and they will kill more people than the pipelines. If you want to stop the flow of oil then people need to stop purchasing.
9994 2018-04-18 03:46:04 You know I was just reading an interesting take on why seed oil is better than butter. It's along the lines of 'land dedicated to dairy can be turned over to oilseed and the crushers/processors can get rich out of it'. Now...how to convince people not to eat butter...
9995 2018-04-18 03:45:59 Seriously?  He's smart?  What "god"?  You've got to be joking.  If not I've got some snake oil cure all I'd like to sell you.

10004 2018-04-18 03:44:34 I’m depressed. This was the same day I saw you! lol. Definitely became my newest favorite strain. I had to watch the oil drain into my purse before making the final, desperate attempt to smoke the last of it. lmao.
