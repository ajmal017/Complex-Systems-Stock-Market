67)Housewives complain about high prices of commodities.
47 2018-08-02 21:01:31 Sounds like sheer madness. 7.5% gold/7.5% commodities is insanity & we like returns/yield. I'd rather chance quality REITs on rising rates than bonds. 30% stocks would be for somebody over 85 :)
All-weather to me is good now AND in slowdown. $DEO $SO etc
48 2018-08-02 20:59:09 They have been beating #copper & other #commodities with the notion that #tradewars are going to slow consumption, but the one they really want to suppress keeps coming back with vengeance. #CrudeOil is going to spike out of control and take #Inflation with it, give it some time.
49 2018-08-02 20:55:12 Ray Dalio's all-weather port recommendation is only 30% stocks (seems weak) and 7.5% commodities (lol) and 7.5% gold (lol again), & zero REITS (would would rather have REITS than Pet Rock & commod)   Sounds like you have a different port in mind than his all-weather allocation.
50 2018-08-02 20:46:53 Now, if you want to talk about the underlying technology being really innovative and have alot of potential, then yeah. But crypto right now are just high volatility digital commodities.
51 2018-08-02 20:09:28 Lots of countries have commodities. A big part of the decision of whether to invest in a place like Canada or Venezuela or Chile: what is the likelihood that I'll be robbed of my investment by local, regional, or national politicians? Socialists much more likely to steal.

66 2018-08-02 18:58:27 Of course it would ! Econ 101. The higher any currency goes, the cheaper commodities become for the earners of that ccy, which gives them more discretionary income to spend on more things.

72 2018-08-02 18:29:53 Yah, The day title deeds become commodities is when the real trouble starts.

76 2018-08-02 18:14:21 It will absolutely disrupt your economy. When your government begins this land seizure the international community will ultimately stop importing your commodities. The sanctions will cripple you. Your banking sector will be decimated due to losses.

92 2018-08-02 17:40:45 To be fair, if she did read the first 50 pages of Das Kapital, she would not be tweeting like this but talking about commodities and the exchange and use value with some basic math.
93 2018-08-02 17:37:07 This reminds me of those days when I used to display used shoes and some bananas on the road side and besides that you have to recite the commodities you're selling to attract customers attention. Hustle was real #HNH984

99 2018-08-02 17:21:25 What is killing farmers, miners, oil producers, & investors is the repeal of the Uptick Rule.

101 2018-08-02 17:13:04 He said that he has no idea what they MAY be telling their teammates or the press. He didn't say anything was said about him. He is talking about the way players are treated by ownership, overall, as commodities and not vital parts of the team/company.
102 2018-08-02 17:08:35 Boss find out when was the last time kemsa delivered commodities in the county, do they follow standard operating procedures I think from there you will agree with me but if argue the way economist does like you without involving medical professional we going no where!
103 2018-08-02 16:57:24 not sure it's subtler, seeing as it's increasingly undermining the biosphere with every passing day. but just so long as you're clear, at some point, that it's the accumulation of capital that hides, as it were, from direct sight behind the mass accumulation of commodities.

108 2018-08-02 16:48:15 Have u looked into models for commodities?
109 2018-08-02 16:45:40 I would say monetary sovereignty. I'm not planning to get rich hodling cryptos, at least not relying on it, for I believe that's not the right way.

I want to get rich writing hit songs, and I'll convert to crypto and other commodities like silver and real estate.

112 2018-08-02 16:25:50 La derecha en L.A. es mercantilista. Libera algunos mercados (a veces) pero estatiza el mercado de commodities (siempre).

123 2018-08-02 15:39:53 Heartbreakingly, the administration never had any intention of reuniting all, or even most of these children w/their parents. They don't see migants as humans, but as commodities. $700 per person per day to the greedy private prison cabal. They're a nest of vipers & sociopaths.

138 2018-08-02 14:19:31 Again, Jeff doesn't exist in isolation, but you're right peopke who work will be treated as commodities for exactly as long as they allow themselves to be; that's why I mentioned unions and why we need Corbyn because ordinary working people can only get stregnth from each other.

Mais c'est surtout le fait que la Nouvelle-Zélande exporte principalement des soft commodities (agriculture), qui justifie cette corrélation importante (comme l'AUD avec le CRB).

216 2018-08-02 07:48:21 I've never thought about it before but you are very correct. Physical freedom and creative freedom are rare commodities sometimes.
217 2018-08-02 07:45:34 Equities and commodities are taxed differently, so I'm not quite sure how you square that circle.
218 2018-08-02 07:45:17 In the spotlight, even - especially - in football, you're branded a saint or a sinner. The WYSIATI - What You See Is All There Is - mentality exists in a world of disposable commodities, where there isn't time to fully understand all the complex personalities who play and manage.

227 2018-08-02 07:04:42 They're not buying from us. That ship sailed with Trump's big idea. They canceled those orders and signed contracts with Russia for soybeans and other commodities. *Make Russia Great Again worked well.
228 2018-08-02 07:00:37 Mali's government has granted Randgold Resources a 50 percent corporate tax reduction for the next four years at its Gounkoto mine, the Africa-focused gold miner said on Wednesday. #Commodities #Mining #stocks #StocksToWatch #StocksInNews #StockMarket #assetManagement
229 2018-08-02 06:55:28 As Kenyans we need to be angry with the state of the nation, wanton corruption, government regulations and policies fueled by tenderpreneurs, judiciary being starved, ERC killing us by raising tariffs for energy with no justification, metals in our household commodities. Tuchoke!
230 2018-08-02 06:48:45 Congratulations! I went to Polonnar and saw better improvements than there was before but can not reduce the issue of price rise in essential commodities in the country?
231 2018-08-02 06:39:01 maybe you're confusing terminology here. do you pay capital gains taxes on business  property? thats why not. digital assets are treated like equities or commodities for IRS reporting.
232 2018-08-02 06:38:50 Oh yes. Please teach me about commodities markets. I'll be sure to bring it up at the next Federal Reserve meeting. Go look up the Dunning-Kruger effect.
233 2018-08-02 06:38:34 Democracy biases capitalism towards socialism which helps even the distribution of wealth by robbing from the rich to give to the middle class. The result is cheaper commodities that enable large standing armies that overthrows pure free markets with capitalistic monopolies.

235 2018-08-02 06:20:41 Before you say Big Four... How do tax hikes on basic commodities factor into "encouraging manufacturing sector to grow"...
236 2018-08-02 06:20:09 You simply have nothing to say.
Is it the high price of commodities we'll vote him for?
Or his Tyranny in the cases of shiites and ipob?
Or the way he protects the corrupt people close to him like Babachir Lawal and abba kyari?
Or his medical tourism?

238 2018-08-02 06:05:59 Dont back your currency with oil or any other commodity. Commodities are for consumption. Producers can erode the value at any time by producing more than the market can consume. Is there no sanity left in the world?
239 2018-08-02 05:51:40 We will be looking at the upcoming Iranian naval exercise in the Persian Gulf. It is likely it will practice closing off the Strait of Hormuz, a vital shipping lane for exporting oil.

247 2018-08-02 04:50:26 Quotes wiki articles for econ concepts, doesn't read the satoshi white paper. Lol, k. This guy assumes too much about his while understanding of the discussion. Also doesn't understand why we want underlying commodities which limit supply as $btc doses algorithmically.
248 2018-08-02 04:44:55 Don’t show them your scholarships. I can’t get commodities because of that 
249 2018-08-02 04:43:54 In 1921 all of Europe started to collapse , france had a currency crisis , Russia had a revolution , Germany headed in to Weimer, uk began an all asset collapse , commodities collapsed yet we think of it starting in 29 in what was a regional economy in the USA
250 2018-08-02 04:23:36 How about you segregate the various agricultural commodities and talk about the different industries. Majority of farmers are not wealthy. and for the ones who are so what. Teachers and fire fighters are wealthy, but you willing let them take your money.
251 2018-08-02 04:22:52 @AmitShah @AmitShah @narendramodi @PiyushGoyalOffc @arunjaitley People want BJP to stay. But BJP is driving away the poor, middleclass & employees' voters who goto booths & vote unlike the few rich. Prices of essential commodities being high BJP getting to power chances are bleak
252 2018-08-02 04:12:25 Gold and silver, like other commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity, the quantity of labour bestowed in procuring them, and the value of the capital employed in the mines which produce them.

255 2018-08-02 03:36:45 This is nauseating. Isn't he in govt? Who does he he expect to do it. All talk! Sakaja ask the governor to buy medical commodities for Nairobi facilities.
256 2018-08-02 03:28:14 Agreed! SAKAJA IS NOT A LEADER. No one asking him why his county never allocates cash to buy medical commodities.
257 2018-08-02 03:25:33 That might be 100% true in a commodities currency (pre-'71), but I'm not sure if it's 100% in the U.S.'s current fiat system, esp. in a globalized economy...?

If the rest of the world decided to use Chinese currency to contain international wealth that might cause inflation too?
258 2018-08-02 03:17:21 Y si saben que los commodities están en bajada xq siguen interesados en vender sin generar un valor agregado, por favor despierten ya la guerra comercial nos esta devorando, hay que apoyar la industria y no depender de importación ni del primer sector como la enfermedad holandesa

261 2018-08-02 03:02:54 Lo que mejor sabemos hacer exportar commodities cuyo valor dependen de factores externos, sumado a q le bajan retenciones y dejan que los usd queden afuera.
Suma que la baja de retenciones encarecen el producto en el mercado doméstico. Eso esta bueno???
262 2018-08-02 02:51:45 Oh, also, steel and such commodities are essential parts of our national security. Both quality-wise, and availability. Lack of steel can cripple us.

265 2018-08-02 02:31:10 True. Rigging all world trade so that all currency has to use the US dollar is a great was to enact imperialism through economic means. 

3rd world country needs to buy commodities, better convert your money to dollars.

US needs commodities, fuck it we’ll print the cash.
266 2018-08-02 02:22:58 But you still buy basic commodities. It’s these that people get rich off of.
267 2018-08-02 02:10:41 I met many fabulous trader at the Chicago Board of Trade and during my time at Commodities Corp. Rather out of touch with younger traders today.
268 2018-08-02 01:52:18 Rapists & pedophiles don’t live like this. It is an abomination and a crime against nature and the cycle of life of mother nature to continue to treat other species that are not human like commodities, objects, or beings without feelings. It’s 2018. We know better now
#Compassion
269 2018-08-02 01:44:45 Just because a commodity is currently plundered from the GS doesn't mean it has to be. The metals in your phone could be mined in the US, it's just cheaper to get them from Central Africa. Post-revolution one could both make reparations AND produce said commodities.
270 2018-08-02 01:29:02 El anterior era infinitamente más inútil! Es más, nos hizo más daño por lo inútil que por la corrupción. Un sólo dato->los commodities agrícolas valían el doble que ahora, teníamos superavit fiscal y comercial...no hubo obras, dejaron déficit, desastres diplomáticos, pobreza, etc

272 2018-08-02 01:14:10 Why does the dictionary say groceries are: “ food and other commodities sold by a grocer.”?
273 2018-08-02 01:02:05 And according to UN data, it's valued at about $142 billion.

To put that into perspective, the global coffee market — one of the most valuable commodities on the planet — is valued at about $80 billion per year...  CANNABIS is on the Rise.

It has also allowed men to use women as commodities more without consequence, leading to disrespect.
