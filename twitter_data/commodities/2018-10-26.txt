Sorry I thought we were shouting out our favourite animal commodities.
1 2018-10-28 23:51:10 I put this on Rodgers. 3 and 6 and he wastes time trying to draw them offsides and then wasted a time out. What the hell was the point? Possesions are precious commodities in a game like that and he's being cute.
2 2018-10-28 23:50:38 No Luke... it wouldn’t. Supply chains want security not simply falsified data of commodities based paper certs... 

Only realistic USD alternative would be a new “commonwealth” digital currency with the US as a basis along with U.K. and Australia
3 2018-10-28 23:48:00 Pricing oil and other commodities would do the trick.  In theory, ~$7T in FX reserves could then be used to pay down offshore USD loans everyone so (rightfully) worried about.

10 2018-10-28 22:55:37 Sure, but if those aren't sustained through the business cycle then they aren't real improvements. Anybody can rise a commodities supercycle up and make everything looks rosy.

15 2018-10-28 22:39:40 I usually do make economic args! Economic mismanagement across the commodities cycle is not destiny. Systemic corruption is not inevitable.
16 2018-10-28 22:35:22 Tell me again about how commodities use their jewishness to turn money into more money.
17 2018-10-28 22:29:25 The computer and tech industry is the counter example to this.  There are a multiplicity of commodities that are far cheaper than 50 years ago, and the companies that make them are among the most valuable on the planet.

1. Como investidor, meus comentários são mais sem graça. Acredito que o mercado e a economia são soberanos ao político no longo prazo para ditar o rumo das ações. E no nosso caso, as commodities são as grandes protagonistas.
41 2018-10-28 22:05:48 Egypt's state grains buyer, the General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC), said on Friday it has bought 470,000 tonnes of wheat in an international purchase tender.

#GASC #Egypt #wheat
42 2018-10-28 22:03:23 Transportation economics are based on supply and demand the same as other commodities. Building more roads increases the supply, making it “cheaper”, therefore more people drive. Planners have known this for years, and why new strategies are needed to encourage mode shift.
43 2018-10-28 21:57:01 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
44 2018-10-28 21:44:22 When we say you're all just bunch of incompetent blokes, you keep reinforcing that impression.
Are they not our taxes? You have taxed everything, goods and commodities hitting the highest in history of this country and now that you have milked us dry you call that an achievement?
45 2018-10-28 21:42:46 the reason is simple, value is relative.
If people are told that there is an abundant supply of commodities, how would that affect the perceived value of said commodity?
Nothing malicious, just that underlying desires tend to influence eventual results.
Same for nuclear power.
46 2018-10-28 21:42:38 Su estupidez humana nos costó 11 años de mierda en dictadura... y nos costó perdernos la posibilidad de ser un pais decente y con proyeccción, cuando despilfarramos los millones de los commodities en guasadas!

51 2018-10-28 21:07:29 yep. ideed its very impressive specially with what happend to iron ore and commodities in 2014/15
52 2018-10-28 20:37:14 #Ecommerce
Commodities and basic/everyday consumer goods, purchases which are easily reordered and replenished, are ripe for auto-replenishment features; milk, lightbulbs, batteries, printer paper, coffee. These goods will actually be easier to replenish without a browser.
53 2018-10-28 20:32:30 Sunday nite calls, corn steady up 1,soybeans mixed up 1, wheat up 1 to 2 cents. Corn harvest now close to 65 percent done, soybeans 75 percent. South America  weather non threatening . Wetter ECB and SCB ahead. #harvest #demand #elections
54 2018-10-28 20:28:16 This looks like surrendering oneself to luxury commodities... a form of self objectification in #socialmedia
55 2018-10-28 20:21:44 However, it is yours.  The only one who is crazed, & a stumbling is u. U have botched the trade agreements, costing our farmers, auto plants jobs, parts, and commodities, w/saving u/your family business & for Corporate America big $. Which is now causing a recession to start.
56 2018-10-28 20:00:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
57 2018-10-28 19:58:24 @atiku sir, if you are voted into power come 2019, how are you going to solve the high cost of commodities in the, market, and unemployment nationwide?
58 2018-10-28 19:57:54 @JonesMusara  please people quing for fuel &basic commodities you call it factional?even ED is not supporting this madness.
59 2018-10-28 19:52:13 tbh I’m fairly new and ignorant about this discussion so I appreciate any type of elaboration. but it makes me feel like the patriarchy has convinced ppl (mainly women) to treat themselves as commodities to not challenge male entitlement ergo continuing to promote rape culture?
60 2018-10-28 19:33:14 Remember when Jameis Winston and Marcus Mariota were the hot QB commodities? How is that working out? #nevermind
61 2018-10-28 19:18:55 You ask the most important question,HOW??It`s just BG123 said,Comex Rule 589 a&b, that`s how,very important to understand it`s functions. It would appear,,and looking sooner than later,The enitre Commodities Market will run on XRP,The 589 Rule is a cirtcuit breaker. ;)
62 2018-10-28 19:17:01 The banker who trades in commodities is a murderer.
63 2018-10-28 19:16:19 Nigeria could afford to continue subsidising those commodities because the price of oil can maintain our lavish lifestyle.Then something happened, the price of crude oil crashed because the White man discovered how to convert shale to oil and started using other energy sources..4
64 2018-10-28 19:08:17 And between 2015 and 2018 were the years of Massive Job Loss, Massive Fulani Herdsmen Killings,Massive Hunger, Double Payment of Subsidy and Massive Increase in Petroleum Products, High Cost of Food Stuffs and Essential Commodities, then Economic Melt down(Recession).
65 2018-10-28 19:06:25 se for economicamente, vale lembrar que o maior parceiro deles é os EUA (agenda de direita) e depende muito deles
também depende bastante de commodities como o petróleo, que segue em uma baixa histórica
de qualquer forma, ele segue com popularidade bem alta dentro e fora do país
66 2018-10-28 19:03:56 toothpick, stew, etc. These commodities are imported to our country using mainly dollars. The exchange rate market works on the principle of demand and supply. So because we almost always chasing dollars to meet up with our import bills and only few countries use naira... 2/
67 2018-10-28 18:54:54 Great intentions Leanne. The late President Nyerere of Tanzania once criticised the western economies who wanted free trade for cheap African commodities like cotton but high tariffs for high value metals such as Nickel. i.e."free trade not aid" is the key to economic prosperity.
68 2018-10-28 18:48:26 Since I was born this has been Naija worst 3years! So many companies have left Naija, consumer commodities gone higher than ever!
69 2018-10-28 18:45:22 Requiere retenciones? En época de boom de commodities no aumentan ganancias de empresas (incluidas agrícolas)y por lo tanto los impuestos recaudados?
70 2018-10-28 18:36:44 State capture. Certain people are on a major task to control basic commodities. We gonna beg for our basic rights. Finally be slaves

72 2018-10-28 18:16:48 Se dan cuenta si el Kirchnerismo con la época de bonanza q tuvo con las commodities y sin haberse dedicado al robo y a la fabrica de pobres,se hubiese dedicado al desarrollo y a la educación? Esto extensible al Peronismo.

77 2018-10-28 17:25:36 Gold is a commodity not a currency. Bitcoin is a peer to peer currency as stated in the beginning of its whitepaper and also a commodity for various reasons. Most commodities have rarity as one of their attributes. The commodity status of btc should be viewed as a 2ndary feature.

82 2018-10-28 16:45:53 O desemprego saltou em 2016 pq no ano anterior houve uma crise de commodities, mais decisões erradas da presidente que tbm não pode consertar por endurecimento só congresso e posteriormente pelo impeachment. Onde vcs estavam esses anos todos?vcs liam o jornal?
83 2018-10-28 16:32:49 There have been reports for weeks that their asking price is ridiculous, 2nd+. Who tf would ever pay that for a guy who has already fallen off the cliff. He has 3.9 ypc and 40 ypg.

They have no self-awareness for how bad they are or how much commodities are worth. Consistently
84 2018-10-28 16:24:34 I've observed that when prices of fuel are raised, prices of a host of commodities, public transport systems, auto fares etc also go up. A cut in fuel prices later, do not result in the fall of prices of goods & services. @narendramodi @arunjaitley @psspillaibjp @mohandastg

91 2018-10-28 16:03:05 People take some tweets way too serious. 

People are still in the euphoria phase on the stockmarkets. 

We will face a big stockmarket crash in which generally $BTC will be bullish, as it’s superior to $GOLD. 

And even commodities will raise in uncertainty.

94 2018-10-28 15:52:46 Oil and arms are commodities. Anyone can sell. But the US has stopped being a center of influence. By our actions, and by the presidents own words at the @UN. By consciously receding as fast as we have, we almost intentionally created a vacuum for them to fill.
95 2018-10-28 15:51:44 If commodities are on all time high, there must be strong inflation. But Strong inflation is also good for stock markets.
96 2018-10-28 15:25:40 I think I obsess more about US economy than any commodities or securities. I am Canadian but have been building my life around this collapse for the past 10 years. I’m ready.

NHS could save £££££££££s by providing community setting but don’t and LAs don’t care because they have no responsibility financially. LAs need to be equally involved then things would change. People are seen as commodities
125 2018-10-28 11:45:07 Ungarwadziwe nekusabvira kwemoto uchitadza kurwadziwa nekushaikwa kwema basic commodities,??? Why do you choose to put yourself in a cage of foolishness and idiocy?
126 2018-10-28 11:35:24 Yes. We could do a much better job harnessing the potential of our commodities. At the end of the day it boils down to our ability to value add, sell the results globally and have a fair tax system. Entrepreneurship is an essential ingredient in this mix.
127 2018-10-28 11:22:00 What is the stance of African Union? And how could it affect the union's ambitions of forming a single market within the next decade and maintaining intra-African movement of people and commodities?
128 2018-10-28 11:18:20 #RaslimaliForLivestockFarmers Do you know livestock contributes over 30% of the farm gate value of agricultural commodities, about 10% of the national GDP and at least 50% of the agricultural GDP?
129 2018-10-28 11:10:17 The one thing current government should focus more is making "price control committees" and mechanisms effective. Nowhere the government issued rate lists are being followed that is why public is crying over inflation as are charged much more than set rates of all commodities.
130 2018-10-28 11:06:35 Subhadip sir, with regards to system based trading, could you pls highlight any notable differences between commodities on MCX and liquid scrips on NSE? Since you have done both extensively, would love to hear you in detail, if possible. Thanks in advance
131 2018-10-28 11:06:08 Someone managed to make prices of everything to FLY, shortages of basic commodities to FLY even higher, not mentioning the economy. And you are busy talking abt doves
132 2018-10-28 10:50:32 woa that is surprising. I gully expected commodities to be bullish. can you shine some light on the implications for the broader market? not a commodities guy at all
133 2018-10-28 10:35:14 I don't know how you are nt ashamed @MBuhari even if you r so busy am sure u use the basic commodities such as water,fruit,tissue,comb etc things that are supposed to be the most affordable commodities in the society.n am sure while growin up this thing are not more than #5 naira
134 2018-10-28 10:32:05 Jovem, cite suas fontes diretas. Site da internet não é orgão de pesquisa, você deve saber disso... Boom das commodities nada tem a ver com redistribuição de renda, investimentos em educação, nacionalização do pré sal e reforço na fiscalização e rigor anti corrupção.

136 2018-10-28 10:27:55 Paulo, do you think that commodities prevent us from exploring the world? Is it easier to travel when you are young, then when getting older, considering that in young age, one has nothing to lose!
137 2018-10-28 10:15:26 Yes, money may flow to UST because @federalreserve will keep them propped. Eventually it has to end with the collapse of the $ against real stuff (commodities & Gold). The stocks -treasuries yo-yo will collapse sending a torrent of paper money to Gold, silver, commodities.
138 2018-10-28 10:10:15 All the soybeans and other commodities not going to China, etc. could be purchased at fair market value by the Federal government and sent to other countries that could use it as part of foreign aid. Would that be too much win win?
139 2018-10-28 10:09:00 And your empty skull refused to aid you thinks what was the economic situation in the country as 1999, how much was petroleum pump price, price of a bag of rice and other commodities as of 1999 compared to 2015. The foolishness of the illiterates keeps getting worse
140 2018-10-28 09:45:09 In truth I do think of Bitcoin as a “naturally occurring” Ponzi. With that model of thinking it opens up deeper discussions on the behaviour of SoV assets. The difference between gold vs equities vs non-scarce commodities vs real-estate vs fiat. Fodder for a tweet storm.

142 2018-10-28 09:31:24 Why is it that almost all the retailers increased prices of basic commodities? Not to be out done butcheries too have increased the beef/chicken prices
143 2018-10-28 09:27:14 Dairy, meat and poultry commodities are some of the widely purchased commodities in daily basis...
144 2018-10-28 09:04:45 Nice answer but the industry that markets such chickens will almost certainly involve cruelty. 
When living beings are used as commodities, there's always those that go unsold, what happens to them?

149 2018-10-28 08:08:54 The livestock sub-sector contributes over 30% of the farm gate value of agricultural commodities, about 10% of the national GDP and at least 50% of the agricultural GDP.

151 2018-10-28 08:02:10 APC hiked d price of all commodities & d salary hasn't changed. 
They said they can't increase to what labour demanded.
152 2018-10-28 07:45:40 And his comments about commodities exports the EU was just a lie. I live in Kansas City and was a member of the Kansas exchange before selling to Chicago Merc. 85% of the worlds wheat came through KC.
153 2018-10-28 07:39:59 Buy the refinery not the oil. Buy the McDonalds store that generates return on investment not the Beef Patties that may or may not increase in price. Businesses over Commodities always.
154 2018-10-28 07:35:18 talagang yan, ikakalat nyo. pero ung boracay, ung lower prices ng commodities, silent? thank you so much for your love for our country.
155 2018-10-28 07:25:21 That's why you've to constantly be in contact with people you're in the same biz with so as to standardise price for your service/commodities otherwise people will just be rushing you because you're cheap and still they won't appreciate that you're just coming
156 2018-10-28 07:13:28 Whats new ?  IK is running Givt on increasing  Electricity Gas Petrol cost. The increase in the cist of all other commodities is directly proportional to the increase in cost of petrol electicity and gas.  He is adding in the 60 years mess. Same old tactics , nothing new.
157 2018-10-28 07:11:12 Fintechfx ASIC licensed expires soon. The license categories is cannot trade in forex right ? Or it’s was acceptable only for commodities ?

159 2018-10-28 07:06:15 My impression is that people from South American caravan have an average of eight kids, but no job and no place to go. Is this the Catholic Church again? Someone hire them. Make them apply for citizenship. Otherwise what’s the problem? I think we can spare some commodities.

166 2018-10-28 05:46:55 Before governments took over the economy with fiat currency, ppl paid each other with commodities and goods. Crypto brings that back. 10 years from now, my local supermarket will accept payment with gas(#eth) / money (#btc) / any utility value that is acceptable locally/globally
167 2018-10-28 05:31:45 Any company that exploits it's workers is at a strategic disadvantage to a more enlightened competitor that sees its workers as assets and rewards them in proportion to their individual contribution. Unions, through their collective bargaining reduce workers to commodities
168 2018-10-28 05:14:56 Community domination is the root cause of patriarchy.. Comes from our tribal roots which considers women as commodities.. our own commodities to be guarded,others’ to be acquired.. eg: Sania Mirza marrying Shoaib is not 2 ppl marrying.. its considered Pakistan’s victory over 
169 2018-10-28 05:07:38 It has to. Bakeries wl close down if the price remain at $1. It is the buying power of the bond that has gobe down. The price of brd must move in e same basket wth other basic commodities.

174 2018-10-28 04:17:48 Yup, we are all now losers experiencing &  feeling the effect of high inflation causing high prices of gas & basic commodities. Let’s celebrate by eating bukbok rice & GG w/ formalin. And congrats to your idol for making corruption worse than before. Cheers, moron!
175 2018-10-28 04:14:26 Sim, commodities com preços exorbitante possibilitam programas desse tipo. N acho que os governos PTistas foram TOTALMENTE horrendos, mas simplesmente não compensa tudo isso SE o governo institucionaliza a corrupção e usa esse dinheiro desviado pra comprar o congresso.
176 2018-10-28 04:04:33 Vc merece esse país,achar que a corrupção não tem problema,então não tenho muito o que dizer,a economia estava boa por conta das commodities,então era um fenômeno mundial,por isso tínhamos aquela estabilidade financeira,e depois onpt indivíduo a população e hj veio a conta.
177 2018-10-28 03:58:00 There are lot of places to trim fat in a farming operation when challenged with low commodities prices, but fertility and crop health is not the place to start. Double down and haul more bushels to town

179 2018-10-28 03:38:22 And I have never blamed even Congis for price rise and fall of the similar commodities nor I have blamed anyone for any of the inflation related issues. Coz having completed PG in economics and commerce I know that even if you are a gold medalist you can't put a stop on it.
180 2018-10-28 03:27:22 Why would a Zanu PF supporter spend the greater part of the day discussing a mere 'njiva' in MDC instead of the corrupt Queen Bees & long winding queues for fuel and basic commodities? Thus a sign that there is relevance in mentioning the popular MDC.
181 2018-10-28 03:06:30 O PT surfou nas commodities e o Brasil morreu na praia. O dinheiro acaba algum dia.

185 2018-10-28 02:30:00 And the NFL is a company, it makes sense for them to market their commodities with a globalisation strategy to increase profits. The NBA are also seeing the potential and rewards and next year the MLB are using London. Maybe you need to think and understand before you comment

187 2018-10-28 01:31:57 Rupee deprecations by 15% is like having a 15% customs duty on all commodities.. They are priced at a discount to landed prices... IT has gone up due to rupee... commodities haven't ? Opportunity?
188 2018-10-28 01:27:29 It's the language of a pretty rotten businessman speaking of human lives as if they are disposable commodities.

197 2018-10-28 00:16:12 Wallahi  for me @MBuhari has failed,  can you honestly tell me that your way of living in the last three years is same as today?  Is the price of commodities you buy in 2014 same as the price today?
198 2018-10-28 00:14:50 Who knew Fudge Squares and Jelly Snakes would be the ‘go to’ commodities in the markets.

Let’s use tradeable commodities to back currency instead...and free-market capitalism that doesn’t price us humans like heads of cattle.
245 2018-10-27 19:29:15 Not commodities?
246 2018-10-27 19:10:04 Love all the negative people on here I ask myself why your all in crypto when you clearly don’t believe in it. Cash is dying and so is the stock market. So crypto’s and commodities will win.
247 2018-10-27 19:05:19 1)This can never be correct! Communities on whose lands multi nationals & other so- called investors must respect the communities rights 2land ownership &recognize that land includes minerals &all other commodities mined in that land!

254 2018-10-27 18:08:34 There is no best recipe. You have to find what suits you. 

My recipe is a diversified mix of

- alts 20%
- real estate 25%
- commodities 5%
- fiat 30%

%’s vary in time, depending on personal (financial) situation, marketcycles and human emotions.

266 2018-10-27 17:06:35 O Lula implantou o Bolsa-família nesses moldes e em larga escala, isso não tinha sido feito antes. E a discussão dos commodities é outro assunto completamente diferente. Certo que eles foram responsáveis por um sucesso econômico, o problema é dependência exclusiva deles
267 2018-10-27 17:02:18 Según el código monetario la #criptomoneda no es un medio de pago, tampoco lo son los otros commodities como el trigo, el petróleo o el café; pero eso no implica que puedas dejar de comprar o vender trigo, petróleo, café o bitcoins.
268 2018-10-27 16:58:11 Si no se producen baterías y productos con valor agregado acá no lo veo como bueno a esto. La web de Ensorcia dice claramente “global commodities”. Que no sea otra historia de sacar materia prima, dejar la mugre acá y terminar importando bienes derivados de nuestros recursos

Cigarettes are targeted at recently proletarianised populations, where low wages and the absence of other affordable commodities are key factors in binding workers to production where returning to ‘the land’ (and thus self-abolition/autonomy) is still historically practicable.

281 2018-10-27 16:07:18 Reduced prices of basic commodities shouldn't be a scare. We should further subsidise production to make it convenient for farmers to produce cheaply.

Life’s good .
284 2018-10-27 16:02:48 Yes. We trade with both Russia & China. TRUMP is working on making their markets better for us. We have grain elevators in Duluth/Superior that send commodities grown in North Dakota to Russia. 

Hillary lost-Americans voted! Electoral College voted. Russia did not vote. Wake up!
285 2018-10-27 15:58:02 Dear Piet, first of all there are two tipes of inflation/deflation 1)asset inflation and 2)commodities inflation. Both are usually going in the opposite directions. We are currently in the bottom of the cycle - assets high, commodities low. When commodities rise -> assets fall.
286 2018-10-27 15:42:42 Did you know, the "My Account" page allows you to easily track your orders against grants, budgets, commodities, labs, professors, etc.
287 2018-10-27 15:37:57 Yes, there are many consequences. Global markets do have a way of optimizing commodities. However, perhaps more Britons will be able to grow locally produce now though without international competition.
288 2018-10-27 15:37:02 @hamzashafqaat DC sahab you are working hard, we expect you ll take measures for price control of veg, fruits and other commodities being sold in ICT Sectoral Markets at 4 to 6 times the actual market rate.

294 2018-10-27 15:08:01 Problem is, when the main response farmers have to commodities not being worth much is to produce a larger quantity of product to sell, it creates a self-feeding loop

298 2018-10-27 14:56:58 Yeah don’t we all? I just hope your idea of smart is not ‘dealing’ in forex and commodities. Sometimes hard work is a principle, it made these nations as advanced as they are.

4. Humble views of themselves and society.

318 2018-10-27 13:32:49 So so true, I got ridiculed by many when I showed them the price history of commodities after futures were put on them, a majority declined. I said that if the past is anything to go by bitcoin price will fall when futures go live... history repeats.
319 2018-10-27 13:24:34 We are selling it now. The only problem is that the price is set based on what it's worth in the US, as all our commodities are.

Why do you want to saddle businesses with the additional cost of providing healthcare for employees?

Given the implementation of  R.A. 10963 known as the Tax Reform Acceleration and Inclusion Act (TRAIN law), and the increase in prices of fuel and food commodities,  the concessionaire (TAFT and SDA) will adjust their prices effective November 5, 2018.
336 2018-10-27 12:20:40 If oil palm were replaced with soy in the regions it is currently cultivated, it would require 9-10 times as much land due to low yields. In such a case, soy is far worse. Best to demand deforestation-free commodities wherever they come from!
337 2018-10-27 12:15:50 Sure it will drop. That's commodities. Quotas didn't save us in 09 either.
338 2018-10-27 12:07:57 Of course it was. The PT party used all the inflow of funds to leverage consumption instead of investing in infrastructure and public services. The result is that when the commodities boom slowed the country went bust under Dilma.

343 2018-10-27 11:47:26 Correct. I have both. Private healthcare offers shorter wait times in non-life threatening conditions and better ‘hotel’ type commodities in hospitals.
But if my life is on the table, I’ll go to a public hospital where cost is a lesser concern.

345 2018-10-27 11:30:50 I get annoyed on your behalf when I read these things (silly I know I’m a complete stranger). An actor you want to see being unwell is a chance you take when you buy tickets for a show. Actors are human, humans get ill.  Act human and don’t treat them like commodities.
346 2018-10-27 11:22:43 The margin is definitely high. It's amazing when you do an historical analysis on commodities that there are times when prices go under production and times when they go way way over. Bell curve is normally they are within a reasonable distance
347 2018-10-27 11:20:49 Any economist will tell you that prices of commodities are determined by several  factors including rate of demand! Expecting uniformity in inflation is insanity!
348 2018-10-27 11:11:28 So, it looks like US soyabean exporters have been given a lifeline by #Iran, stockpiling ahead of sanctions, after sales to China slump because of Trump trade war. @ft commodities story. Weird world we live in.
349 2018-10-27 10:39:42 can sex ever actually be a commodity properly speaking? it is not 'created' for a market. even if theres extra sex being had for the purpose of selling (like other surplus production), quantitative production is not governed by market pressures in the same way as commodities

359 2018-10-27 08:55:17 Did you know that GDP includes debts as commodities? I’m talking about national debts, not just individual debts.
360 2018-10-27 08:29:17 Completely agree Georgina, it's just about "owning" the first piece of AI production (I'm not even calling it Art) in the vain hope it rises in price.  It's stockbroker buying of commodities not art appreciation or valuing aesthetics.
361 2018-10-27 08:29:03 Dont dramatise things. Why shld I be ashamed? Tell me of a country that doesn't import commodities? Do you know that supermarkets in Botswana are stocked with basic  commodities impprted from South Africa? So what are you talking about?
362 2018-10-27 08:22:47 It’s 2025. 

$BTC is worth $150,000. The whole cryptospace is around $10 trillion. 

Stockmarkets swimming around the bottom after a 80% decrease. 

Housing bubble popped & commodities hit ATH. 

Governments just issued $BTC as the new standard. 

Life’s good .
363 2018-10-27 08:16:33 With your globetrotting tendencies nuuh i don’t c any changes,it seems the more u go out the higher the prices of the basic commodities become.Youmight hv the brains but the system won’t let u use them coz Zanu Pf never listens.Word of advice resign 4 the sake of yo name.
364 2018-10-27 08:05:44 Like I said, opposition supporters in cities live a protest life, cause chaos to feel good about themselves. Basic commodities are there just that they are hoarding them

Its also in Zimbabwe were people unite against minor and trivial issues like St Johns college case and ululate when Delta sabotage the economy for the sake of profiteering
370 2018-10-27 07:40:44 I don’t track #commodities through this platform but definitely over on @tradingview. I also paper trade $USOIL now and again on my demo I.G account.

372 2018-10-27 07:31:26 The figures are what they are but I am still not seeing progress on how you will change corporate models to stop seeing people as commodities. Until you change that mindset I just see Labour as treading old ground and it worries me.

376 2018-10-27 07:05:09 Everything goes in cycles has normally 10 - 15 good years then bad years property, stocks, commodities. When everyone hates something so much they believe it will never go up, then you buy!  Ask someone on the street, they will tell you silver will never go up  understand ?
377 2018-10-27 07:01:30 Agree that legislation is a bad way of economic solutions e.g bans, price control. They lead to scarcity of commodities and sabotage
378 2018-10-27 06:51:18 Arresting forex traders and forcing shops to reduce prices of basic commodities isn't the solution, lets look at  the causes not symptoms.
379 2018-10-27 06:44:15 I do understand.! I’m aware of many of these studies done at small-scale.! All excellent work and part of the solution, but small-scale success on single commodities does not guarantee that the extraploation will be successful across all food systems.

4) inflation was all time high, at 11.7%. At that time, fuel became expensive too and the rupee too become weak. And the essential commodities became so expensive too!

386 2018-10-27 06:04:10 Why bread only yet other commodities were hiked
387 2018-10-27 06:04:05 For the sake of good progress and for business to move on without hustles of basic commodities,why can’t the Gvt dollarise the economy as soon as now going forward ,whilst they find ways of dealing with the problems affecting citizens...Bond notes must just go now

390 2018-10-27 05:35:24 Disgusting. They are treated like throw-away commodities.  It's too easy to acquire a 'pet' and some people should never be allowed to 'own' one.  I'd like to see a ban on mass breeding and retail of companion animals and strict requirements on anyone wanting to adopt.
391 2018-10-27 05:30:13 Hey, it is always easy to blame the institution without understanding the law of the land? Is crypto currency a trading commodities, or it is currency instrument?

398 2018-10-27 04:25:18 How could we have controlled the hyperinflation though ?
 I don't we need bond notes for present. However,  we need bond coins for change only. Bond notes are creating greedy behaviour among the ordinary folks and elites and causing commodities hoarding.

I’m telling you if your only investment is a 401k , you should not have concerns at all.
404 2018-10-27 03:37:02 Not the intention. It’s to destroy Brexit, to enable new world order to progress to one Government with no individual culture, sovereignty or identity. Slaves shackled by debt as they control all commodities and markets. No coincidence we are JAMs

412 2018-10-27 01:34:25 When the opposition shared power with these maggots, life was better between 2009 and 2013 and we never imported water and there were no shortages of basic commodities.

413 2018-10-27 01:31:01 Indeed the right direction with high inflation, rising prices of basic commodities, low price of shabu, rice crisis, high unemployment, peso and shares dip, our islands in wps being occupied by China , widening trade deficit etc.

PEOPLE ARE NOT COMMODITIES! #TrumpTrash #GOPlyingGarbage
417 2018-10-27 01:12:35 ...So is Goodwin saying that we should talk to, and ultimately "compromise" with racists? What would that compromise look like then? Also, I don't like that marketplace bollocks. A very odd metaphor, like ideas are these commodities produced (by whom?) and exchanged in a vacuum.
418 2018-10-27 01:07:37 @DeleMomodu unjustifiable double standards, myopic and visionless economic policies, beggarly supplies, rationing of essential commodities,
419 2018-10-27 00:20:46 Sure. Trump's tariff's resulted in a %25 imposed on american soy beans and pork going into china. That is 50% of the market for US growers. This caused a huge decrease in bean an pork prices as well as a huge decrease in corn and other telated commodities....

You are a "beta minus". Read Brave New World. It is their term for people like you.

You want people to live like drones. In soulless, mass produced, commodities hives.

I am merely stating facts.
423 2018-10-27 00:04:21 Yeah, I guess the trade off is thousands die so CEOs can make millions overseeing unfair distribution of healthcare. Again, all commodities should solely be judged on marketplace value alone? By that logic, babies are worthless. No market value there.

428 2018-10-26 23:31:02 China recently ruled it as property. In 3/10 cfct announced that the federal court had classified it as a commodity.

473 2018-10-26 20:51:01 I doubt if any especially the elites in the Democratic Party who are prostituting illegal aliens and many naive minorities who they exploit and then abandoned after they are used and abused. The DNC sees their followers as expendable commodities for political purposes only.
474 2018-10-26 20:46:01 Competitive vs Non-Competitive Markets: Commodities are an example of a competitive market, with no control over price. Monopolies are non-competitive. Language services are somewhere between these extremes #ATA59

476 2018-10-26 20:42:18 Cryptosoybeans would be like securitized physical commodities but in bearer form.

Pros over futures: transferability, smaller minimum size.
Cons over futures: more capital intensive, possible tax implications, less liquidity.
477 2018-10-26 20:41:11 Yep money is just the residue of suffering aka exploited labor and production of living things into commodities.

479 2018-10-26 20:39:07 So Marx literally explains how value is created in a capitalist society and how these relations exist only in the exchange of commodities but somehow this is a real quote from one telling another to read Marx.

The world is a fucked up place.

484 2018-10-26 20:16:36 Your callous ignorance to the ongoing situation is sad. Just because you have it good and can afford or get access to scarce commodities, doesn't mean everyone else can.
485 2018-10-26 20:11:48 Commodities had a good finish to the week. Commodities don’t trade like that when the stock market is crashing.
486 2018-10-26 20:07:24 Soros wealth is more liquid. Can move markets, etc. he can play with currencies, commodities, equities, etc. ‘to make a point’ to some limited extent on paper.

487 2018-10-26 19:59:04 It's all capitalism. Students are commodities. Not people anymore. @wmnjoya tore him to shreds on an FB post today. She saw through his bs as clear as a crystal.

493 2018-10-26 19:33:53 I didn't imply that these countries were unwise in their dollar pegs, although these policies are what made them vulnerable to currency speculation.

498 2018-10-26 18:44:56 Só vale lembrar que mercados como no nosso ou vendem commodities pra países mais desenvolvidos, ou vendemos bens de consumo (que são mais valiosos) pra países menos desenvolvidos, como as parcerias na África, focando no mercosul (Argentina nossa maior compradora de carros) e etc

518 2018-10-26 17:37:38 ok Professor @Nouriel, we get it. You hate crypto and what is represents...

So as an investor, where would you place your bets for 2019 ? As $DJI and other index are going down... Would you chose commodities such as gold, uranium or bonds, or simply buy $ ?

538 2018-10-26 16:51:15 You're right food prices will rise, not only as import from EU. Basic commodities and oil are brought on world market in dollars, not pounds sterling. So as sterling falls against the dollar, so everything rises, including transport of food to supermarkets, passed onto us.
539 2018-10-26 16:48:55 The Mnangagwa lead government could start rationing commodities to grow the economy
540 2018-10-26 16:47:05 Commodities: #Cocoa +2.72%, #Rubber +2.35%
Top commodity gainers are Cocoa (2.72%), Rubber (2.35%) and Wheat (1.59%). Biggest losers are Natural gas (-1.50%), Gasoline (-1.32%) and Palm Oil (-1.21%).
541 2018-10-26 16:45:57 Saw fairly large deals (RTGS/$) going through today at 300%. As you say cash being mopped up to use to import basic commodities which can absorb a lot of premium.

549 2018-10-26 16:15:42 I don't know what these numbers represent and I don't have time at the moment to sort it out, but you know very well that they don't represent what oil companies actually get for various commodities.

557 2018-10-26 15:52:13 No she's right, we don't get paid anything - just a stack of IOUs from the US Treasury that have abstract value not tied to anything stable like precious metal commodities or bitcoin.
558 2018-10-26 15:51:48 O primeiro governo Lula foi "bom" porque o Brasil nadava em commodities. Mas ao invés de investir em infraestrutura e abrir o mercado para que nos edificássemos, ele "optou" por angariar votos via programas sociais que nunca poderiam atender a todos. Agora a conta chegou.

562 2018-10-26 15:42:56 Porém, o povo sem esclarecimento do interior não entende que nossas commodities estavam no auge da alta, que o mundo vivia um forte ciclo de crescimento e que FHC, entregou a casa arrumada para o PT.

565 2018-10-26 15:32:02 The high correlation between prices and labour-values is computed from sectoral input-output data (e.g. total price of output of oil, agricultural, service sectors etc). On the order of 50-200 sectors. So highly aggregated prices and labour-values (and composite commodities).
566 2018-10-26 15:31:28 I remember when they stopped crude, NG, and soybeans imports too and then either gave in immediately after or no one noticed because their commodities.

598 2018-10-26 14:02:29 During the blight of the 19th century, Ireland produced enough goods to feed and supply twice its population. Are you sure it was the lack of imports that was the problem and not the mass exportation of commodities out of Ireland driven by profit motives?

617 2018-10-26 12:55:25 What's your comment on prices of basic commodities as compared to those of overseas where you used to stay?
618 2018-10-26 12:54:11 So was Harrison. I think they just understood instead of having 3 (2T 1G) unknown commodities on the line its better to have only 2 (2T) .

633 2018-10-26 11:44:09 On average, transport costs have increased by at least 50% whilst basic commodities are in excess of 70% increase. Salaries, on the other hand, remain stubborn and have, in the event of such, increased by 10%.
634 2018-10-26 11:35:15 In many commodities, declining  quality and limited accessibility of new deposits will squeeze supply in coming years, potentially driving a commodity-price rebound as global demand continues to rise. If lessons of previous cycles hold, mining equity prices could be expected

724 2018-10-26 04:34:15 The creation of most commodities doesnt include sexual consent
725 2018-10-26 04:30:02 TIL: McDonalds brings the mcrib when pork prices are down on commodities markets
726 2018-10-26 04:18:03 Good going sirji. It was much needed to clear the air of confusion regarding current market price of agriculture commodities.
727 2018-10-26 04:16:19 Correct, we need to solve immediate problems, cash crisis, basic commodities shortages, corruption. If we can solve that then we can plan for the future whilst the present is stable.
728 2018-10-26 04:10:23 Sounds like classic alienation. Marx argues that fetishizing commodities
leads us to attribute magical, personally transforming properties to the goods we buy.

730 2018-10-26 04:03:12 “As commodities have become less important”?

The journalists at @TheEconomist obviously don’t understand terms of trade and the massive role Australian commodities play in keeping Oz afloat!

Who ghost wrote this junk - HnH?
731 2018-10-26 03:54:56 Asteroid mining could change the economics of "unobtainium" commodities. Rare earth's platinum gold markets would crash.
732 2018-10-26 03:52:28 Unfortunately those in Parliament, of course save for a few, they went there to loot government coffers. I am not seeing them standing for our cause. They are the very business community which is involved in hoarding and over-pricing commodities and creating artificial shortages.
733 2018-10-26 03:48:48 Unlike you poor people don't drink petrol and diesel. Other essential commodities are well within control. Relax! Enjoy a cup of petrol!

737 2018-10-26 03:13:20 Commodities super cycle. Bull market dude.
738 2018-10-26 03:13:20 A política está para a bolsa assim como a moeda está para a economia. Ela pode até afetar algo no CP (via política monetária) mas seguramente é neutra no LP. Estou contigo Bredda. Se há boom de commodities até eu viro um Warren Buffett e a Dilma o Winston Churchill.
739 2018-10-26 03:07:15 Ooh, if only i had a stock-portfolio…

- Sell everything, buy commodities, metals.
- Wait for Dow to hit 21500.
- Buy. Wait for 23000 (maybe).
- Sell. See how low it goes.

741 2018-10-26 02:56:35 ECOP also underscored that inflation is not the fault of employers. They believe government should work on lowering the cost of living and prices of basic commodities. They also recommend that the excise tax on fuel, which was imposed due to TRAIN Law, be lifted. #minimumwage

743 2018-10-26 02:44:55 La baja productividad se soluciona reduciendo el retorno del factor trabajo? No creo. Lo que falta es mas inversión privada. Esta vendra con mayor estabilidad política, orden e infraestructura. Muy influenciada por factores externos (precios commodities).

746 2018-10-26 02:28:53 Money stays in stocks. Money stays in commodities
747 2018-10-26 02:10:08 Nosso país deveria ser uma potência mundial. Territorialmente, é o país mais invejado do planeta. Commodities? Tem. Dinheiro? Deveria ter. O que não tem? Honestidade e competência. A hipocrisia paira sobre nossas cabeças. Muitos de nós, infelizmente, tem a memória curta demais.

750 2018-10-26 01:57:01 Yes po, Ma'am I got your point. That is why we elected them not to stop the increasing price of the basic commodities but rather control them. Ang mali sa DU30 Admin e they tend to focus on political issues that will benefit the few instead of solving the economic issues.
751 2018-10-26 01:53:38 Commodities are fungible tho

753 2018-10-26 01:46:33 We need to re-open our industries and start production of those basic commodities forex is being spend on. Zimbabweans can grow a lot of the raw materials that can be use in the production of soap, cooking oils, butter, material/fabrics etcetera. Lever Brothers, David Whitehead?
754 2018-10-26 01:42:49 They are currently at the rein, our oil is currently in the dumpster, our commodities are currently up, our debt is currently in manageable.  I can’t blame the conservatives for those things now can I?
755 2018-10-26 01:31:45 Unfortunately bb, humans are now seen as nothing but replaceable commodities. If you don't meet expectations, you are pretty much valueless. It's disgusting.

760 2018-10-26 01:10:38 Como dijo Mollineau, la gente progresa A PESAR del estado, no GRACIAS al estado.
Argentina salio de una recesion, tenian las reservas liquidas, nos perdonaron deuda, y encima subio el precio de los commodities.
Si no creciamos en esas condiciones no creciamos nunca.

762 2018-10-26 01:08:06 You've described Brad Wall to perfection. 9 deficits in 10 years and he had a commodities run of $100 oil. You gotta try hard to screw it up that badly.

I have joyed his commentary for well over a decade.
He called the bull up, and the bear down
not just in crypto
But across gold, coffee (commodities), and forex
 
764 2018-10-26 00:44:37 Of course these are all sources created by British officials or European cartographers. Adam Matthews Commodities or Empire collections might have some more options?
765 2018-10-26 00:41:45 This is a great point. Why isn’t this being covered like the other guy that’s on the other side of the world?  Both countries supply the US with commodities. 
766 2018-10-26 00:38:48 What makes you different from the average Nigerian politician that is APC today and PDP tomorrow? Just stick with ur Buhari. 
Those who queued for hours to buy essential commodities in 1984/85 knew b4 hand.

768 2018-10-26 00:20:56 "Niche" investing strategy has been recently embraced by CTAs and other quant funds: searching for "uncorrelated returns" in power markets, Turkish scrap steel, obscure chemical products, or eggs in China - they're less arbitrated and subject to wider moves.

769 2018-10-26 00:20:14 We will go into another "commodities" run especially in metals after stocks dump. Just like in 08'

O dinheiro é do povo seu filho da puta.

Só coincidiu do Lulinha pegar o país com dinheiro em caixa, inflação controlada e alta das commodities.
771 2018-10-26 00:11:16 Centrists can't differentiate violence against people from that of property because capitalism has conditioned us to see people as commodities and corporations as persons. Everything is expendable unless its their person or their property.

773 2018-10-26 00:06:43 My favorite Alan Greenspan quote was to Brookley Born a regulator for commodities then, he told her they're going to disagree on fraud...I think the market will police against it" lmafo
774 2018-10-26 00:01:32 Its about nothing more than maintaining the US Dollar and US control of SWIFT. As long as countries need the dollar to buy oil and commodities, US can deficit spend, sanction countries, military spending etc. How far is the US willing to go to protect the almighty USD money tree?
