57 2018-07-12 23:31:46 Thematic is a dangerous way for most investors to pick stocks, as themes tend to follow hot trends too late to make money.  A systematic approach, perhaps diversified across themes, is better for most.

65 2018-07-12 23:23:02 I agree. RNVA needs to let up on the dilution for a while. Most big board stocks only dilute as the market can handle it. RNVA needs to show restraint to help the ticker recover and continue to grow the PPS. RNVA will regain confidence from shareholders if this happens.

74 2018-07-12 23:13:47 The historical term for today is "nether stocks": Stockings covering the legs and feet. In the 9th century, persons of rank wore them as high as the middle of the thigh, but in the lower classes they only reached to the calf and hence were called nether stocks.

200 2018-07-12 21:35:29 I understand where you’re coming from but with 3 stocks in 5 minutes it’s easier to get a lucky stock or two and camp your opponent out (with projectiles or speed perhaps) and win like that rather it always come down to KOs which it does in 3/8 min or 2/6 min

259 2018-07-12 20:59:06 Stocks rebound; tech rally sparks Nasdaq to new record
260 2018-07-12 20:58:18 Mmm... the game Trump plays, you should see what happens to those stocks when he talks sh't
261 2018-07-12 20:58:06 I just felt last week the reporting was off on the reaction to shareholders and a blown out of proportion query on switch hardware. Stocks falling, especially in this industry the way it works with Nintendo is less to do with confidence but more to "ROI" in short term gains.
262 2018-07-12 20:57:49 My portfolio consisting of $FNJN, $KDP, $XCRA, $JP, $DZSI, $EVC, and $CCRN has beat the $SPY based off a 5 year backtest. And I only picked those stocks based off the strictest screen on #Finviz limited to stocks under $30.
263 2018-07-12 20:57:37 I've seen you say that you're taking home most of these stocks over the past few days. Does that mean you've bought more? Or that you're still holding?

268 2018-07-12 20:55:07 Do you think we will ever see Apple stocks significantly dropping (like BlackBerry), and or going out of business?
269 2018-07-12 20:54:28 Last week we reported that their stocks dropping over falling investor confidence. Today we reported an NPD prediction it will outsell competitor consoles in 2018. Those are not mutually exclusive. Even last week we talked about how it could be a blip if Nintendo moves hardware.
270 2018-07-12 20:51:12 Defense stocks gain after Trump claims NATO will boost military spending. Although as usual, the truthiness of his statement was in question.

272 2018-07-12 20:49:41 #Sector correlations inside the S&P 500 continued to fall over the past month, a very good sign for US #stocks. Lower correlations are an underappreciated argument for staying long US #equities or at least giving them the benefit of the doubt in a strange & uncertain environment.
273 2018-07-12 20:49:36 $IZEA didn't trade the open coz was v crowded. Yes dilution pm, knew filings but manipulated stock. Took sh morning pop 1.90 doc half 1.70 and rest itm.

274 2018-07-12 20:48:08 It means the stocks are sold and bought by the same person.

283 2018-07-12 20:44:20 Stocks bounce back. The Dow closed at 24,924.89, up 224.44 (+0.91%). Nasdaq +1.39% (record). S&P +0.87%.
284 2018-07-12 20:43:28 Maybe they really will ramp up spending, as Trump said they will, but a few leaders said there won't be any changes and it's hard to take him at his word.
As I mentioned in my own story today, Trump tweeted that the US should spend more as well and defense contractor stocks rose.
285 2018-07-12 20:43:17 The top five stocks that closed higher today were $CA, $ISRG. $IPGP, $ALGN, and $ADSK.

286 2018-07-12 20:42:47 Stocks are artificially inflated by institutional investors IMO. You can make money of course, no doubt, but if you want to "store value", good options are limited rare assets like Gold, silver, or now cryptocurrency like bitcoin...

309 2018-07-12 20:33:45 The stocks have already swapped @CGasparino 

Stop pouring gas on the flames. It’s already happened.
310 2018-07-12 20:33:33 That is actually a great point. But I for instance trade stocks out of my TFSA. Using it as savings for retirement or first-home purchase. I rarely meet the maximum anyway. But raising it by a few thousand would help sunstantially once the act grows and larger trades can be made

331 2018-07-12 20:22:07 Look for stocks that have high implied volatility relative to their realized vol. Ranking volatility and selling options when the IV Rank is high might be a good place to start too.

369 2018-07-12 20:09:10 That's IMO a fallacy. A marketing narrative used by crypto fund managers to sell. There's as much asymmetric risk as with any penny stock. Pension managers don't invest in penny stocks. In crypto prices can fly and go to zero, both, just as with any high-risk stock.

392 2018-07-12 20:00:18 It’s impossible to tell now, but starting 3 stocks may prove better for competitive consistency by minimizing the damage that SD’s and lucky hard reads have on the outcome of individual games; however, This also empowers defensive play since you can risk more neutral interactions

394 2018-07-12 19:59:24 I can tell you that what you'll hear is the same thing you've been hearing for years. WE WANT SINGLE-PAYER.

400 2018-07-12 19:57:54 There is no rhyme or reason on how I pick stocks. It’s what I think about when I’m analyzing or making a decision at the time. None of it really matters. It’s all a risk. And y’all know I live on the edge.  If I accidentally get rich living my life then cool.

441 2018-07-12 19:39:06 i wish the market would hurry up and realize what the analysts are realizing lately, that corn stocks are tightening in 2019.  maybe trade's not believing 2.2% increase in world demand in WASDE???
442 2018-07-12 19:38:45 Stocks are ignoring the trade war and $tbt is buckling down for it.  Guessing some serious hedging pain out there
443 2018-07-12 19:38:38 Greg Jensen, Bridgewater's co-chief investment officer, said in a telephone interview this week w/ @Reuters: "U.S. markets are not in long-term equilibrium. We believe the next move is into cash, as we believe stocks and bonds are going to perform poorly over the next 18 months."

515 2018-07-12 18:56:39 Hoy el Departamento de Agricultura de EEUU - USDA - anunció stocks de soja mayores a los previstos en 15,8MM toneladas vs 12,8MM toneladas previstas.

520 2018-07-12 18:53:15 Interesting potential positive feedback loop there?

e.g. Illiquid stocks get pushed up more, making them a larger relative component of index, driving increase in future demand, which drives them up more relative to peers, etc etc

592 2018-07-12 18:16:45 That too. But the greater issue I took with it was the simplistic notion that value is wiped out. With stocks or equities, the value is never gone unless it folds or you sell.

641 2018-07-12 17:50:22 Cruise line execs say one thing. Financial Analysts and the stock market have their own opinions. It’s weighing on the cruise stocks. That’s the part I don’t like lol.
642 2018-07-12 17:49:29 I go often and always get a parking spot. Maybe it's more about supermarkets infringing on the market territory. My local Metro now stocks mostly everything I can get at the market. I go by choice, not necessity, or to buy in bulk. The market is almost a luxury these days.

684 2018-07-12 17:25:53 The caveat for trading large cap stocks is that it may take a long time for you to fully familiarize all the essential patterns from which to profit off accurately.  If u don't go full ass, then u may be worse off than penny stocks which is intrinsically more 'straightforward'.

3) more patterns to take advantage of

947 2018-07-12 15:56:45 I bought stocks of a helium production company thinking they may rise dues to all the anti trump balloons being filled. Unfortunately they stuck a pipe up Trump himself in error but he can hold so much of the stuff that I've made a fortune.
948 2018-07-12 15:56:37 Did they lose their assets? Money, stocks, homes? If not, you can consider if an early retirement package.
949 2018-07-12 15:55:48 Was it cash or stocks from PZZA?
950 2018-07-12 15:55:35 Why do people look at health insurance as this all-encompassing package for healthcare. It isn't. It's basically paying a company to foot the bill for you and they get the money back, either from you or the government. you have other options, like savings, stocks and more.
951 2018-07-12 15:55:19 The economy is booming IF you consider the economy the stock market which is the only thing #Trump sees. Passive income for the elite is huge. We need a much better way to tap stocks that go to every working class American.  The tax code was written by the elite, for the elite.

972 2018-07-12 15:46:32 So stocks were okay before Trump took office and Spectacular after he took office.  According to you he’s a “bad choice for POTUS”. I wonder if your 401K would agree with that

1009 2018-07-12 15:28:13 You are partly correct. I can tell you as a business owner, I’ve seen no difference in our tax projections. Mark partly dictates cost, but look at how many companies have been buying back stocks as opposed to raising wages. Who does this benefit besides shareholders?

1129 2018-07-12 14:40:12 Want to make money in the markets?
Buy what others can't stand. Buy what folks absolutely hate the idea of owning.

1337 2018-07-12 13:36:53 Agree, and the US needs global bid for USTs...but the US also needs a global crisis to drive a bid for US stocks...but given the size of UST issuance & equity mkt cap, its unclear where the funds to bid both would come from, ex-coordinated CB action.

1389 2018-07-12 13:10:04 Last question, and I will not waste more of your time Sir- PPF, FD, SIP and Stocks.....is there anything else a 27 year should be looking at ?
1390 2018-07-12 13:09:30 What f— growth. Making the wealthy greedy capitalist corporations who left the Amer worker behind and continue to do nothing but to buy back stocks with their tax cuts instead of Trickling down or even dribbling down
1391 2018-07-12 13:09:29 Yes it’s much better than a trading bloc. It’s done wonders for our environment, workers rights, fish stocks, international development, stood up to global multinationals. Plus our young people can live and work without restriction across the EU

1395 2018-07-12 13:07:02 Companies have been buying back their own stocks to prop up value for years now. Wages have been stagnant for years & personal debt is at unsustainable levels.  If you are looking at stock prices as the indicator of a healthy economy you will be surprised.

1401 2018-07-12 13:06:13 FYI: you may want to edit the article. After all the praises the last paragraph says that IBM is not one of the top 10 stocks to buy. But who reads the entire article, right?
1402 2018-07-12 13:05:44 i really wanna know the tea tbh.  i remember yg bragging about how unaffected his stocks were & then nothing 
1403 2018-07-12 13:05:24 “In sideways markets, range trading can prove attractive especially in slower moving liquid large cap names. These stocks tend to reverse at prior support/ resistance points (but not in all cases) and the moves between these two levels can prove profitable.” #education @LVDTA
1404 2018-07-12 13:05:04 That’s my opinion I’m leaving it at that. Now I’m gunna go research stocks and index funds so I can try to make myself a billionaire the normal way
1405 2018-07-12 13:04:27 I have no idea how one can have an opinion about share buybacks without also having an opinion about what those stocks are worth. Wrt value, buybacks can be good or bad depending on price-versus-value. Price matters.

1416 2018-07-12 13:00:25 Commodities are a very difficult investing product.  Boom or bust cycles. Unlike owning index stocks which constantly filter out the losers and try to incorporate the new and improved companies.
1417 2018-07-12 12:59:27 Isn't that like asking why invest in stocks?
1418 2018-07-12 12:58:53 Hey J, does it buy from the entire market (Dow/Nasdaq/S&P500/Russell) or does it (4 example) buy only Dow, and does it also trade ETFs and/or Mutual Funds that trade like stocks?

1420 2018-07-12 12:56:36 Poor people shouldn’t be stashing cash under the mattress. Much higher return from buying a house with the leverage from a mortgage or buying stocks.
1421 2018-07-12 12:56:08 No shares $CNTF from @SureTraders this morning.  This has become a regular occurrence.  If they do have shares they restrict it 2:1 margin 1:1 margin etc.   It is actually quite annoying... No stocks moving this week have had any shares.

1444 2018-07-12 12:44:56 A great tactic is slowly scroll thru some of the MAXLIST stocks. Frame up pre-market action. Helps us be prepared for the open. Also helps us see HOW strong or HOW weak we are. #stocks
1445 2018-07-12 12:44:19 No it’s non of these reasons lol. Reporting crypto is a new concept for CNBC, they generally report stocks. Stocks are generally represented with year to date charts. Thus, the picture represents BTC year to date chart. They chose this because it shows HUGE support for 2018 here.
1446 2018-07-12 12:43:51 Congrats! On the $DIS $ATVI announcement, I picked up some $ATVI August calls. Rolled out my August $SFIX calls into September calls. Love subscription stocks like $SFIX $NFLX $AMZN (prime) and $SPOT among others :-)
1447 2018-07-12 12:42:28 Wasn’t aimed at any one person really. Everyone is pro their own stocks, why wouldn’t you be. I see it like someone trying to sell me a second hand car though. Might be a good deal, might not. But I’m not just going to buy because someone else says so..
1448 2018-07-12 12:42:13 Why is it topinfo only Ramps stocks that have had a placing or are about to have one? Yes we know why!
1449 2018-07-12 12:41:53 #Stocks,#Indexes NDX BOTTOM SIGNAL will complete at the open. SPX likewise, but its signal is technically inadequate to cover the short. Charting aside, recall that a bottom signal by either index SIGNALS A BOTTOM FOR THE MARKET. Only top signals are index-specific.

1451 2018-07-12 12:40:45 The stocks won't be much of a problem but the debt! If foreign countries started dumping US debt we'd be in a world of hurt. They'd have to start printing money willy-nilly to pay bills and that leads to inflation and higher interest rates and devalued currency
1452 2018-07-12 12:40:34 If promoter shareholding of a company is changed & there is no info shared in public domain reg same then shareholders should fight for compensation of loss from the Company / @SEBI_India or Exchanges.. Retweet if you agree

1507 2018-07-12 11:57:36 I don't short individual stocks. I buy stocks that short the markets. Big day for me yesterday but I sold half the profits I made yesterday in the post market at the end of the day. Now I'll buy those stocks back a lot cheaper depending how the charts look & then hold them.

1527 2018-07-12 11:44:58 Capturing returns does not involve predicting which stocks, bonds, or market areas are going to outperform in the future. Rather, the goal is to hold well-diversified portfolios that emphasize dimensions of higher expected returns, control costs, and have low turnover.
1528 2018-07-12 11:44:46 Suggest it is now critical that influential journalists demand President Trump release his tax returns. A significant spend  increase of this size would be a huge boost to defense stocks. Does he advocate for worldwide defense or the Trump stock portfolio?
1529 2018-07-12 11:43:36 @Cody228 If youre calling a stock your “baby,” you have other things to sort out before figuring out which stocks to choose.

1652 2018-07-12 09:52:58 Exactly. Anyone hardly heard of BEPL, Goa Carbon, Graphite India, Phillips Carbon etc. before these stocks started to advance last year and hardly closed below 50-DMA during general market corrections. Fortune is often made in small names in this business.

1995 2018-07-12 05:32:18 I get so many queries about AvantiFeeds, took advice of technical tracker,stock is in weak trend at the moment but it is market leader in its industry & has proved multibagger, so should come out of this negative trend even on minor + newsflow.

2004 2018-07-12 05:29:07 Stocks and commodities recovered slightly on Thursday as markets tried to consolidate from the previous session's steep losses when fears of an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war jolted investor sentiment.

2007 2018-07-12 05:27:10 Is this on priorities caused by brexit, eg food stocks, turbines, benefits to those who lose their jobs and the additional cost to infrastructure and education etc once access to EU funding is lost.

2016 2018-07-12 05:18:02 Happened to me in the beginning, too. What helped me was to trade higher priced stocks (mid and large cap) which have larger floats or more shares traded on a daily basis. Means less chat manipulation and less volatility, but better practice ground to work on entries.

2048 2018-07-12 04:58:21 Hi Vaibhav,

A MF scheme usually holds more than 40 stocks on an average.

Investing in 20 schemes will eventually make you invest in around 800 stocks, out of which 40-50% of the portfolios are same.

This approach dilutes the returns.

2053 2018-07-12 04:53:14 Add an option to see top pre-market gainers and to see a chart representing account value for traders. Would also be nice if OTC stocks would be an option to trade in the future, but it's not a big deal as most of them have low volume anyways.
2054 2018-07-12 04:50:45 Market has reached its highs just because of few stocks. We have still see pain in Midcap and Smallcap. Crude is still on high. I don't see any recovery on trade defict and other macro fronts. Currency is stable but tomorrow RBI announce forex reserve data than after see.
2055 2018-07-12 04:50:31 They’re basically barred from entering the US market. Apple is public listed & stocks are open to the public and they’re globally accepted.

A poem should be convertible

2093 2018-07-12 04:10:41 That is true. Now usually I’d think equities go inverse, weaker currency starts “helping” exporters and acting as a domestic policy easing for them, so stocks go up in the domestic country. Now it’s opposite. US stocks are rallying during stronger dollar, and China/Japan/EU down?

2115 2018-07-12 03:53:49 Not really. If folks are buying bank stocks, they would have made only a dividend return (at most) in the big guys over 18months, done their arse in $BOQ.AU and gone gr8 in $MQG.AU - its all the big resource names, midcaps & CSL.
2116 2018-07-12 03:53:44 You lied (immediate recession! Nope. Stocks and shares will tank! No. Inward investment would collapse! Nope again). You cheated (£9m tax payers money on propaganda). And you still lost. I would be quiet if I were you.

I guess it captures the largest market caps, but some of the emerging stocks such as META and CHOO are left out - they're up 40% the past several weeks. Maybe the index needs to be broadened i.e. Canadian Marijuana Index 100.

2231 2018-07-12 02:47:33 "الإستثمار الحقيقي يتم في القيمة وليس السعر، علينا أن نسأل ولا نفترض، هل هذه هي قيمة البضاعة الحقيقية؟
 فالبضاعة الغالية لا تعني بالضرورة إستحقاقها!
كذلك السهم، نزول سعره لا يجب أن يكون دافعاً للإستثمار فيه، فقد يكون السعر حتى بعد النزول مبالغ فيه وبعيداً عن قيمة السهم"

2351 2018-07-12 01:20:44 Economies grow when people make better goods and services. Goods and services grow through investment, investment is made with money which is loaned by a bank that uses money that is saved by a rich person. That’s the trickle down.

2353 2018-07-12 01:18:37 Time to scan for stocks
2354 2018-07-12 01:18:08 Lmao $TINO trades above .10 a few years ago and considering penny stocks are cyclical it’s time is coming
2355 2018-07-12 01:17:44 Not too sure. Some smoke and mirrors though more knowledgeable friends are definitely in. Unsure of stocks these days.
2356 2018-07-12 01:17:43 2/ higher prices wiping out any tax breaks for working families, higher fuel costs because auto manuf rolled back emissions standards by CFPB, a Pres who has divided & polarized the US, lies daily in spite of video evidence to contrary with impunity, avg workers in stocks? Uh uh
2357 2018-07-12 01:15:50 So most of corn stocks increase is due to extra 0.9 bpa. Only minor change on demand side
2358 2018-07-12 01:13:58 Hey genius, this is an AR-15 with a modified bump stock. Not a normal every day AR. Also, bump stocks are fun but you can't aim for shit. This whole thread is full of idiots who think this is a regular AR. They've obviously never used one. It's not an 'assault weapon'.
2359 2018-07-12 01:13:18 German carmakers are not thriving; their returns on capital employed are less than 6% and their stocks have consistently under-performed local and global indices.
The ones thriving are US consumers purchasing these vehicles at prices susidized by German shareholders and bankers
2360 2018-07-12 01:12:58 After entering (commitment) it needs to be tracked for and weekly CCI crossing below 100, that can be first indicatn of exit. Go for stocks where M cci >100, stocks would be most strong and will retrace well (usually). The strategy is based on cci levels with strength
2361 2018-07-12 01:12:32 Amateur looks at price performance of stock but what really drives stock is earnings of business .compare Earnings growth vs stock price will show true picture of stocks performance.
2362 2018-07-12 01:10:57 I don’t short stocks.  A friend called and said short XYZ.  Why, I asked.  They just fired me.  Oh.
2363 2018-07-12 01:10:11 Bond market has been relatively muted compared to Div. stocks. That’s where the ass-whopping from rising rates has happened. Of course, that was highly visible.
2364 2018-07-12 01:10:04 If I continued with same stocks page industries, Titan industries, Ttk prestige , gruh finance since 2008 without shuffling here and there I see I could have made 3 times more money than I have right now . More damage happened with switching to other stocks though I made big sum

2368 2018-07-12 01:05:33 I’d expect Forbes to know that having a $900M revenue company doesn’t mean YOU are a billionaire. 

I worked for a CEO & founder of a $70M revenue company. He made good money ($6M/yr after stocks & bonuses) but the company was in the red $15M a year for 3yrs straight
2369 2018-07-12 01:03:56 Next the Fed will take the handoff, halt QT and restart QE.   Meltup from everyone  trying to short FANG.  yeah it's hard but they are printing money and buying stocks.
2370 2018-07-12 01:01:29 Halmoni: im not drinking any softdrinks anymore

2371 2018-07-12 01:01:00 Yep, c'est malheureusement extrêmement probable, avec l'intérêt du minage à petit budget qui perd de sa hype et de sa côte, beaucoup cherche à refourguer leur(s) rig(s).
Pour être safe, faut prendre du neuf. Enfin, quand le prix sera raisonnable et que les stocks seront présent.

2380 2018-07-12 00:54:48 Time to bring back the stocks.  Right on the national mall until she testifies. People can come by, practice their pitching, what have you.  Perhaps hang a scarlet "A" on her while they are at it.  #LockHerUp

2388 2018-07-12 00:48:44 Not sure if its a good idea to disclose any sizeable positions in public for anything. Especially with small-cap stuff thats shady, whether it be stocks or crypto...

No one understand why Trump is engaging in these tariff wars or what his end game is. The WH isn't explaining their strategy so stocks dropped.

2404 2018-07-12 00:40:33 Yes, I'll have some vinyl badges for purchase. Though the stocks on them are limited. If you want to preorder one for pick up, I can do that for you. To guarantee you get the one you want.
2405 2018-07-12 00:39:20 Very positive for HPCL. It is just trading near its big support. Bulls will look at it for momentum trade. 

OMCs and aviation stocks will cheer this news.
2406 2018-07-12 00:36:23 I need to get back into stocks immediately. I’m playing games like I don’t really want to, but I want to dammit
2407 2018-07-12 00:35:51 the tax cuts were only for the wealthy.  Still no trickle down, and no investment by companies, just them buying back stocks.

2409 2018-07-12 00:35:23 At their highest level for decades - so basically the CFP mismanaged the stocks for decades - realised this and decided to implement policies to restore the levels back to where they were before they mismanaged them. If the CFP is so great why hasn’t   ,  joined?
2410 2018-07-12 00:35:08 I blame @realDonaldTrump for the poor performance of my stocks.
2411 2018-07-12 00:34:59 Thought we could get a nice conversation going tonight everyone!  What #stocks are currently on your radar?  Any changes to your watch list this week?
2412 2018-07-12 00:34:44 Been slowly adding more gold positions and cash as a hedge.  There are long term stocks I’m comfortable holding through a correction.  If the correction happens that’s when you can make some serious money.

2420 2018-07-12 00:28:24 Overall stocks fell by 7.2Mb on the week as Propane and other oils rose by 4.3Mb.
2421 2018-07-12 00:27:38 The bell ringer for the bulls was that commercial stocks fell by 12.6M barrels on the week – this is a whopper as the estimate was for a drop of 3.6Mb.

2430 2018-07-12 00:22:47 @Hardworkingfather I guess you'll be shorting a lot of stocks this earnings season because I'm expecting about 99% of CEOs to do the same.
2431 2018-07-12 00:22:35 Record stocks?

Nope, clearly you haven't been paying attention Danny Boy - the Dow shed 220 points today and is more volatile than ever before.
2432 2018-07-12 00:21:02 Simple explanation - US Fed raises interest rates, more to come. US$ goes up against other currencies. Foreign investors & funds move their funds into "safe haven" US$ & US stocks. Track Ringgit YTD performance against US$. Other Asian currencies?
2433 2018-07-12 00:20:53 I had to buy and apply extra 5 ruble stamps to all of them.
2434 2018-07-12 00:20:48 NFLX dip bought, hold well which is bullish. High quality tech growth stock dip was bought, but with little progress. Industrial material energy financial semiconductor fall hard. This is the market remain cautious. Watch action for key tech stocks such as TWTR sq OKTA coup
2435 2018-07-12 00:20:36 Dude I have a good story about that. When I went to the Russian post office I was wearing my France kit. The postal worker sold me stamps and I left. Later, when I went to mail it, the OTHER postal worker yelled at me because I only had enough postage to the EU not the USA.
2436 2018-07-12 00:17:50 Donates his Presidential pay, cutting regulations, increased GDP, lowest unemployment, stocks up.

2438 2018-07-12 00:17:29 Asia AM Digest: USD Up, Crude Oil Prices Fall. Stocks Vulnerable

2448 2018-07-12 00:09:15 Stocks should go up for this. Fake accounts just clutter and don't look at advertising anyway. They are fictional numbers. Wouldn't you rather invest in real ad $ instead of fake accounts that cost advertisers more money for nothing. But then Wall Street people are idiots.

2454 2018-07-12 00:03:14 Mark it down! January 26, 2018 the Dow Jones hit an all time high of 26,616. Then, in a decision that will live in historical infamy,  Donald J Trump threatened China with tariffs and potential trade war. U.S. stocks have NEVER  made a new high during a trade war. Very sad indeed
2455 2018-07-12 00:02:43 Rather than nasa bahay. Atleast kahit papaano kumikita ng pa tingiting kung nasa bangko. I agree with stocks kaya lang sa bangko nga di sila naglalagay sa stocks pa na mas risky. Having savings account is the first step before going stock
2456 2018-07-12 00:02:12 Other than sharing my portfolio, I would not be answering any query on stocks including what I own.
2457 2018-07-12 00:02:08 It's all about money and grifting, so the fact there is no 'goal' doesn't surprise me. I'm sure the so-called 'Administration' is long defence stocks. It's what they do.
2458 2018-07-12 00:00:35 To people that invest in stocks. I need advice. What to invest in, how long I should wait until I sell, and that shizz. Ive been saving money, and I think I'm ready to make the jump!
