1 2018-08-16 23:41:40 Peter, does your charting style work well with stocks? Why do you focus on commodities and what is the difference between the two in terms of chart reading and applying technical  rules as per your book?

3 2018-08-16 23:34:00 @PeterLBrandt What is your opinion of the current state of the grain markets as well as some of the commodities markets namely uranium and crude? Thanks!
4 2018-08-16 23:19:29 On the other hand, I don’t think a person can get through zal, if it’s a good zal,without learning enough analytical skills to live a meaningful life, regardless of their English literacy. Maybe if housing, food and medicine weren’t commodities they’d have a chance to do so

7 2018-08-16 23:09:50 Sure it would taste good to someone in ancient times, and the modern world didn’t invent the chemistry. But it’s worth asking what is the social function of these commodities? All those other exotic spices were initially exotic markers of status….
8 2018-08-16 23:09:16 Commodities aren't "just anything necessary or not that humans desire and produce". Commodities are things produced for sale in a market.
9 2018-08-16 23:02:22 All those illegal things are commodities.
10 2018-08-16 22:59:25 It was federal and an increase in commodities - not by Drug Ford the Drug Lord.
11 2018-08-16 22:58:28 He smuggled commodities but he also smuggled illegal things like spice, rahtars, and probably other creatures which would be illegal under the Republic or Empire.
12 2018-08-16 22:42:35 "The key for most investors is fixing their beta asset allocation, not trading the market well. The trick is to figure out what proportion of stocks, bonds, and commodities to hold such that a static portfolio is reliable."

13 2018-08-16 22:39:54 appear there either. But I don't think the cost issue is it - medieval Europeans (after the rise of cities and the "middle class" around 1100-1200) were quite willing to pay for other commodities (whole range of v. $$ "spices") because they wanted them.
14 2018-08-16 22:36:30 Commodity prices go up and down. When the bottom fell out of farm commodities in 2014 & 2015 did you blame @POTUS44 & @SenatorDurbin ?
15 2018-08-16 22:35:09 Trading stocks, commodities and pairs isn't as complicated as one might think...all you need is a good strategy and some self discipline!

16 2018-08-16 22:34:40 What would there be for Han to smuggle, if the Rebellion formed a New Republic? The whole reason that Han made a living smuggling, was that Imperial regulations made commodities very expensive, leading to smuggling.  But what need would there be for smuggling after the Empire?
17 2018-08-16 22:33:26 That was in the 90s, they even brought all these foreign companies to acquire the knowhow for themselves. Thousands of Chinese companies now produce unique commodities and this is a dynamic course. Ask yourself why the US and other powers are so anxious to encircle her.

40 2018-08-16 22:23:10 Natives aren’t making warbonnets for sale. They’re sacred items that have to be earned, not commodities. A lot of these half naked “models” wearing them are doing it for money or followers (still translates to profit).
41 2018-08-16 22:09:29 Rule #128: Secrets are commodities, sell them.
42 2018-08-16 22:03:57 All very good pts. I tend to use "franchise" merely for word variation, but you've got me rethinking that. Granted, one might argue that movies are just as much artistic as moneymaking endeavors, but we should perceive 'em more as former. Otherwise, they just become commodities.
43 2018-08-16 22:01:56 Es simplemente aplicar el concepto de la Constitución: los ingresos por impuestos al comercio exterior son para la Nacion: Cristina cedió voluntariamente el 30 % en 2009 porque la situación daba para eso (precios altos de commodities y retenciones en gran nivel).
44 2018-08-16 21:58:30 Stock Markets are Commodities...for Years
45 2018-08-16 21:54:02 After a rough week of market volatility, I have ensured  to make conservative decisions, take profits early and focus diversifying risk across markets.

Good trades made this week. Not all winners, but the NET gain has been profitable.

Drugs problem stil around, police become perpetrators of crime, prices of commodities ballooned, abuse of power, blatant disregard of law & corruption from gov't officials being done right in ur face, selective justice, recycling of bad eggs & many others
47 2018-08-16 21:43:56 Lol. This one is not fine laidis. Buying products is your own strategy of winning a lady's heart? Smh for you. Some purchases made are non-refundable. Oga find your way, she didn't force you to buy her commodities. Shikina

54 2018-08-16 21:10:15 Commodities were hurt the most by the escalating trade tensions with China. Their reaction today was less than stellar.

62 2018-08-16 20:43:10 Semiconductors are commodities.
63 2018-08-16 20:39:12 Bredda, vejo que uma de suas principais teses é que o político interno pouco importa para o IBOV e lembro do gráfico do CRB Index X Ibov. Você dedica seu tempo a estudar o ciclo das commodities? Se sim, recomenda alguma leitura? Abs
64 2018-08-16 20:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
65 2018-08-16 20:27:52 Are u for real? Do you know what ur saying? We are curently knly trading as an EU member state under tarifs and schedules EU negotiated as a massive teading blick with WTO. We leave EU, we must negotiate new schedules and tariffs for all commodities with member states.
66 2018-08-16 20:24:20 When I started doing freight customer sales, I never would have guessed that my three biggest and most valuable commodities I ship would include a nut company, frozen bread, and rolls of carpeting lol
67 2018-08-16 20:14:37 Eu falei que seria difícil vc entender ! 

Os anos de "ouro" das  Commodities , foi entre 1998 até seu declínio em 2010 !
68 2018-08-16 20:14:29 Minerals are commodities so industry can only be taxed so much. Otherwise, it simply wouldn't occur here.
69 2018-08-16 20:13:00 Se eu achasse que problemas históricos se resolvem como mágica, eu votaria no Bolsonaro.
Mas como falei: a ampla aprovação popular permitiria à Lula fazer uma política diferente, se quisesse.
Mas a alta das commodities deixou uma sensação de que tudo daria certo pra sempre. E...
70 2018-08-16 20:00:02 #Gold and #silver, like other #commodities, have an intrinsic value, which is not arbitrary, but is dependent on their scarcity.
71 2018-08-16 19:40:37 A very good article. NT created when intellectual bluff and plausibility were genuinely rare commodities. They aren't now. In one way or another they are a big part of UK's economy. More so than other countries. Arguement for more specialism in Govt to counter balance that bias
72 2018-08-16 19:40:25 A crise de 2008 não afetou tanto o Brasil porque foi o subprime de hipotecas americanas 
Basicamente isso tem pouco a ver com o Brasil 
Nos vendemos commodities
Nosso maior cliente é a China 
Produtos industrializados dos EUA tem substituto ao redor do mundo
73 2018-08-16 19:37:50 Today I watched as the Caribbean's first Agro-commodities exchange opened the doors to its state of the art trading floor in Kingston...Nuff respect to RADA and @AudleyShaw for bringing our farmers into the future. #proudjamaican
74 2018-08-16 19:29:21 Quindi tutte le utilities e le commodities dovrebbero essere fuori dal listino ma sono quotate da sempre! Interessante! Poi mi dici dove hai studiato economia!
75 2018-08-16 19:22:55 Prices are up. Wages are down. Tariffs are killing commodities. Soon inflation will soar. But the 1% are getting (more) tax breaks.  Welcome to Trumponomics.
76 2018-08-16 19:22:45 The Motor Carrier Act "deregulated" in that it allowed new commodities to be shipped and new regions to be served.

It also ended up dramatically increasing the amount of non-union carriers so if you're wondering why it got "cheaper"...
77 2018-08-16 19:18:13 Drugs do not relax you, they turn you into a consumptive addict who relies on commodities to remain socially functional.
78 2018-08-16 19:06:26 We the people determine what the commodities are
79 2018-08-16 19:03:04 ... you follow this guy? "Pure commodities – gold and silver – haven’t done the job of money well  for a few hundred years, and Bitcoin wants to be money but was set up to  work like a commodity." LOL what... You are more confused than I expected.

85 2018-08-16 18:39:19 @MelissaLeeCNBC You talking about commodities made me wonder where Dennis Gartman has been. He used to be on Fast Money a lot.
86 2018-08-16 18:37:39 Tariffs on international commodities is not regulation. You personally know soybean farmers accepting welfare or is this data from some left-wing propaganda site?
87 2018-08-16 18:37:33 Government needs to get out of the healthcare business and allow the free market to flourish. Healthcare is not a right. Rights are inherently intangible, hc is a commodity. When the government starts declaring commodities to be a 'human right' they assume redistribution powers
88 2018-08-16 18:32:04 Today I sleep. Fuck a chart, fuck a dxy, fuck commodities and em. My body has been thoroughly drained. It's been a two day marathon with these things.

No.

93 2018-08-16 17:57:28 Poor rural roads and other key physical infrastructure have led to high transportation costs for agricultural inputs and products. It also leads to spoilage of perishable commodities during transportation. This causes high losses to farmers.

94 2018-08-16 17:52:53 We must not waste such commodities
95 2018-08-16 17:47:29 Yeah let’s wait until Mexico becomes a permanent customer of Brazil and Argentina for Ag commodities before you work on it.    Way to go Mr Trump
96 2018-08-16 17:47:25 Much respect bro. The thing is. I just feel that in modern day football. Fans are being used as commodities, rather than being treated as actual football fans. It’s sad but true.
97 2018-08-16 17:43:56 Sure can.  It's a disaster waiting to happen.  And for most people, they're worse off than before. Higher health ins. prems., gas prices up, commodities cost more because of tariffs, inflation eating up any wage gain, and deficit humongous-the bomb waiting to go off.
98 2018-08-16 17:43:49 Qué putas con los precios de los commodities?!? Me urge un desastre natural en Brasil.

101 2018-08-16 17:31:41 Those who appear to be selling the commodities short for a sharp decline are also selling the bonds, and neutral in stocks with longs mainly in defensive sectors and some exposure to growth, as an overall hedged strategy. PMs will not increase risk much more from here...

103 2018-08-16 17:30:40 Well, since twitter's business model is just to sell us to advertisers it's easy for them to treat people like disposable commodities.

106 2018-08-16 17:25:47 Avni, You mean brokers approved by #NSEL/FTIL were cheating the 13000 investors in Rs 11000 crore NSEL fraud? Where did commodities in #NSEL warehouse go?
107 2018-08-16 17:22:25 The problem with this analogy is that women (and men) aren’t objects or commodities. This analogy objectifies a human before even considering how they “objectified” themselves. Moreover, rape is a crime against a person’s autonomy which is far worse than theft.
108 2018-08-16 17:22:07 Uma bolsa altamente correlacionada com os ciclos de commodities, em um cenário de provável disparada do dólar? Sobe, e bastante, por um bom tempo.
109 2018-08-16 17:13:35 Aussie should be fine. They have a great commodities profile and steady growth with a corner on their market. The AUD does very well, cyclically, as both a proxy for the Yuan ( & others) AND as a solid commodity currency. I've always enjoyed trading its spreads
110 2018-08-16 17:07:18 Viewing and using human beings as commodities are how the present day GOP operates. I really feel like they telegraph EVERYthing they will do because they always assume their opposition thinks like they do...but we don’t. I feel like we need to pay attention to that ~
111 2018-08-16 17:05:54 Commodities weak on risk aversion moves initially triggered by Turkey. Risk aversion leads to a sell off in EM usually. When commodities are off, zar is off. Moodys talked down growth projections for Economy as did the Central Bank governor. Expropriation isnt helping sentiment

113 2018-08-16 16:53:26 There's something called a market, and it has other tech companies in it. So add onto your list 50 & 150, which represent MSFT/GOOG & AMZN respectively. Also add in the numbers for some soap companies or commodities. A random list is really dumb.
114 2018-08-16 16:52:56 Reuters energy analyst John Kemp: "Hedge fund managers have cut their bullish positioning in U.S. heating #oil by 29 million barrels (33 percent) and in European gasoil by 53 million barrels (33 percent) since late May." #commodities #energysector

116 2018-08-16 16:43:39 While players should not be harassed in their down time, this behaviour is a direct consequence of the way football is currently marketed. The more we turn them into consumable commodities, the more we will treat them as products, and not people.
117 2018-08-16 16:38:48 I'm not saying he won't be good as a sophomore. I'm saying that anointing him the second best football player in the SEC and top in the country (per Bovada) is premature. It's also a snub to proven commodities like Ed Oliver (not even considered), Bryce Love or even Jake Fromm.
118 2018-08-16 16:38:05 You know, one can forget that gula is a very old, traded, commodity around the world & for many centuries. It along with other "old world" commodities have a high demand and can wield influence, as history has showed. Take Tobacco for example & it's influence in the slave trade.
119 2018-08-16 16:34:34 commodities by definition have an alternative supplier?..

122 2018-08-16 16:20:23 Israel has the best intelligence agency in the world. I have always had a difficult time believing they can’t find specific criminals in such a confined space. Average citizens are not commodities of their governments to be targeted in war. Not for Israel, Palestine or US. TY.
123 2018-08-16 16:17:23 Um, it was Bill Clinton who gutted the New Deal banking laws and created too big to fail

1994 Riegle-Neal (unfettered interstate banking)

1999 Glass-Steagall repeal (ended separation between retail & investment banking)

2000 Commodities & Derivatives Deregulation Act
124 2018-08-16 16:09:38 Reply to all brain dead. Aiten Goelman is partner with law firm Zuckerman Speader L.L.P. Aiten spent nine yrs prosecuting people like Sen Coons, for the Securities and Commodities Litigation practice. He has returned to his practice now, but .....
125 2018-08-16 16:04:00 The people who actually DO trafficking are rapacious, venal creatures who would traffic less costly 'commodities' for major profits. Moving human beings, even as 'cargo' is NOT cost effective at $100 a head. Whomever wrote this is aiming for
shock and blew it badly.
126 2018-08-16 16:02:40 There is a massive long tail of Ethereum-denominated projects that raised for a host of things (commodities or hard asset backed tokens, copycat projects in Asia, etc.) that are not tracked on Crypto Twitter or by sophisticated investors - for good reason!
127 2018-08-16 15:59:30 word. what's relevant is who is creating the wealth. Labor is what turns materials into commodities, that is the work that is generating the wealth. Increased productivity without increased wages is a directly observable increase in the theft of the value created by that labor.
128 2018-08-16 15:59:26 "Na them dei rush us"
Have you seen Diamond and Gold been rushed in the market?No,because there are EXPENSIVE and RARE.They rush you because you are cheap!Cheap Commodities attract high demand.Beware you are not second hand clothes(Bend down & select/Okrika)
129 2018-08-16 15:53:08 The concept "I struggled so you won't have to." I think, has ruined an entire generation. Struggle breeds urgency, urgency breeds motivation, motivation breeds concepts & ideas. Its on the parent to show how struggle can become opportunity. Make kids future valuable commodities.
130 2018-08-16 15:53:04 True. I live in what was actually the worst hit by the recession area in the U.S. that went to #1 manufacturer. Workers that used to duck landlords & had to get charity shoes for their kids now are hot commodities that can choose from a range of work.
131 2018-08-16 15:52:55 Like burglaries are important for bringing down the prices of commodities?

134 2018-08-16 15:36:20 Commodities are the opium of the people.
135 2018-08-16 15:34:21 Everything till the end is true. The "no market to sell commodities" is ridiculously short sighted.  You need to do some research on why we have to go through this. Starts with decades of poor negotiating for our producers.  Ends with tough negotiating to get back to fair trade

137 2018-08-16 15:25:40 First off, Kudlow cited specific commodities as going down. I cited specific data showing that is not accurate. I didn't say things are not better. I showed the stats he is citing as not accurate, nothing more. Second, giving @realDonaldTrump credit and not @Obama? Silly.

153 2018-08-16 14:30:11 All the start-up movers and shakers are looking for another industry to capitalise on. I'm really not convinced that the art market can be streamlined the way other commodities like fashion and music are/have been. Could be wrong though, throwaway fast art?

155 2018-08-16 14:20:40 At the end of the day,if your currency is not that of the empire then it’s purchasing power overtime is doomed to fail,which is where many nations are now.Eventually 1 liter of petrol will cost you 10,000 usd in your local currency,due to inflation! Commodities are priced in usd
156 2018-08-16 14:16:19 Gas prices are up, commodities prices are down and wages are flat. Your economy just benefits the rich and large corporations! You don't care about workers, who are STILL struggling to make ends meet!
157 2018-08-16 14:15:37 In Nigeria, you need the trio to really move up the ladder. Unfortunately, they are scarce commodities.
158 2018-08-16 14:15:08 Tax cuts applied to people who "consume" commodities, rather then those who buy stocks, would have accelerated growth much faster.

161 2018-08-16 13:58:13 Great Subhash ji. Well done. 
 All shopkeepers must ensure not to sell any commodities in polythene bags and encourage them bring carrybags for shopping.
They may collect all polythene and plastic in the market and dispose it for recycling
162 2018-08-16 13:43:04 And, control of foreign exchange and all commodities. To argue that the Nazi economy was capitalist is nonsensical. It was authoritarian and they used all the levers of power that their limited competence allowed them to use to control all private enterprise. /2
163 2018-08-16 13:40:25 Flood situation worsens in Aluva

Normal life in Kerala has been disrupted due continuous rain over the past few days. Large parts of the state are flooded and supplies of essential commodities have been hit hard.

167 2018-08-16 13:21:55 If we are to go by economically sensitive commodities such as Copper, stocks could drop a LOT more than this. The charts are clear here… the global growth story is over.

177 2018-08-16 12:44:24 We'll see.  China's baseline position is "End USD-centric system for commodities", US' baseline position is "Return China to economic vassal status."  Doesn't seem like there's a lot to talk about.

189 2018-08-16 12:01:52 Sure it does.  It just means that two things are interchangeable.  Which is the case. The speculations are securities (or at the least "securities on commodities") as they easily pass the Howey Test of 1946.  That's why NASDAQ is regulating. It will end up being CFTC/SEC/FINRA

196 2018-08-16 11:42:38 Moisture content in most agro commodities including paddy is not more than 14-15%. Balance WATER goes to ground or evaporates. Thus actual consumption figures need to be worked out rather than total volume.

210 2018-08-16 10:49:27 Both. It depends on my portfolio cash allocation (always try to retain 30-50% cash), price point ratio, etc. Metals (other than GLD & SLV), O&G, & soft commodities are best suited for the futures, so that is largely what I trade to keep an uncorrelated delta neutral portfolio.

245 2018-08-16 08:09:37 Yes it will be "deflationary" but not for US stocks or any of the things we need for daily use. The "deflation" will happen mostly in Gold and commodities.

248 2018-08-16 07:59:08 Unless the boss gives them the exact value of their work, they're being exploited. Under capitalism, all workers are exploited, they are forced to sell their bodies like commodities just so they can eat while the commodities they produce are given to their boss.
249 2018-08-16 07:51:59 Wow, commodities prices have been hammered. But then we have also dropped from 1st to 7th gold producer in the world, and platinum demand will soon be on a free-fall trajectory as the 1st world embraces electric vehicles. Mining is a dying industry in SA.
250 2018-08-16 07:51:26 The problem can probably be put down to guns, ivory and slavery. There was a lot of voluntary trading between Africans and Europeans in all 3 of those "commodities". Greed eventually won out, but all players played their part at the start to set the process in motion.

265 2018-08-16 06:38:46 As you said: “the few ppl the traders paid to round up their ‘commodities’”

But from history I read, often it was hunting parties that were doing this rounding up & putting them on the boats, themselves. Only cost was food for the trip. So much diff than selling soybeans today.

273 2018-08-16 06:04:42 The Nats' supposed commitment to free enterprise was rhetorical. It was relative to a very unfree economy. E.g. it fixed prices, ran monopoly marketing boards for countless commodities, restricted foreign exchange flows, and excluded 90% of the population from many markets.

292 2018-08-16 04:13:47 Slaves were commodities like everthing else. To deny that is ignorant.

We are talking about overproduction and imports. Having domestic products does not excuse you from having face the facts of overproduction and capitalist sales to the global market.
293 2018-08-16 04:07:36 Yea, I was thinking of big retailers that have 100s of products. 

I'm trying to find someone who does a good job of differentiating products that are commodities.

298 2018-08-16 03:52:42 Uranium has already bottomed out and is on the move. Recommend looking into supply cuts this year, very huge deal with demand on steady incline. It's one of few commodities that has actually increased in spot price over the past 2 weeks.
299 2018-08-16 03:47:05 Taxes and debt are social constructs based on private property relations.

All commodities are subject to value fluctuations, due to Exchange on anarchic unpredictable markets. Money is just one commodity.

None of it is necessary.
300 2018-08-16 03:46:36 What happened to self control in leadership? I was recently told of a concept called self commodification that a certain scholar was giving a lecture about.

301 2018-08-16 03:46:19 Interesting. While I have seen /VX carry of up to 28% in a single month I had not considered commodities to have such high carry. Thanks for the heads up.

When it hits US, FED will do what it do best: destroy money purchasing power.
318 2018-08-16 02:34:00 Desaquecimento global reduz preço de commodities e desvaloriza câmbio dos exportadores de matérias primas.

353 2018-08-16 00:35:07 Acho que hoje oque pesou mais foram as commodities, várias fazendo mínima, olhe para isso
354 2018-08-16 00:31:39 imagine having toxic capitalism so entrenched into your mindset that you believe musicians should market themselves so they can convenience a small group of people. musicians aren’t commodities they’re human beings and humans aren’t obliged to cater to your entitlement 
355 2018-08-16 00:31:31 big moves lower recently in commodities, especially copper, gold and silver. CNH lower last night as were major equity indices.  AUD is far too stable in the light of this IMHO. Seeing it going below 0.7000 myself.
356 2018-08-16 00:30:48 Coréia do sul, Japão e Australia caindo. China deve cair, eles estavam dormindo   quando as commodities derreteram.
357 2018-08-16 00:30:02 Couldn't find a soul on my timeline tweeting commodities will go higher from here.  Not even the goldbugs.  Probably getting closer to a bottom.

361 2018-08-16 00:15:33 Is this the "commodities super cycle" Jim Rogers has been warning us about?
362 2018-08-16 00:07:53 And here I naively thought a “commodities trader” would have more respect for the rule of law, particularly when it comes to enterprise.
363 2018-08-16 00:07:41 Tuvieron los mejores precios de commodities. Recibieron un país con la tarea sucia hecha por Lavagna-duhalde.
Y lo único que hicieron fue dejar déficit, inflación y 30% de pobreza.
Cerra el orto gordo.
364 2018-08-16 00:06:35 "THE COMMODITIES ENGELS, WHAT DO THEY MEAN?"
365 2018-08-16 00:03:34 Trump has lost this comsercstives vote as a result of his trade war.  Killing commodities.
