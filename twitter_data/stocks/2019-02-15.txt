1 2019-02-16 23:57:54 Sana pagpunta ko ng district mamaya andun na yung stocks para di sayang pagod aaAaahHh
2 2019-02-16 23:57:12 Time to work and buy stocks. #stocker #stockernotstalker #aretheselegithashtags #stockerfocker
3 2019-02-16 23:53:40 At least bump stocks are banned now due to the tireless work of the VICTIMS of Parkland, Florida...children! I have hope because of them. And no, I don’t believe the 2 Amendment should be repealed just common sense laws need passing!!
4 2019-02-16 23:53:30 credit for these glorious purchase goes to my friend @ssfcvictorylap who stocks her store with only the most awesome of items :D
5 2019-02-16 23:50:02 Unit trusts and stocks and shares ISAs are invested in via your broker
6 2019-02-16 23:47:55 Who is buying the god damn stocks then? I think I know the answer: @federalreserve 
7 2019-02-16 23:47:14 I do not, but my grandfather did. I tried it, it wasn’t terrible. But it didn’t add anything and I don’t own ketchup stocks, so seemed kinda pointless.
8 2019-02-16 23:46:50 Y’all know who Naver has stocks with 
9 2019-02-16 23:44:47 Lots of attention on $GS and $ISRG. I know they’re not your usual stocks, but if tech fizzles out they may be replacements?
10 2019-02-16 23:44:14 More people were killed by hammers than guns with bump stocks , according to the FBI uniform crime report.
11 2019-02-16 23:43:49 2/4 Now, the Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia owns majority of the stocks in Facebook. Through the years our social networking business grew globally which made these insecure people/competitors who can't compete to us/Facebook

13 2019-02-16 23:43:04 Weren't bump stocks banned?
14 2019-02-16 23:38:37 When nan died, clearing her house was such fun. Every room, floor to ceiling, with box after box of oxo cubes of every different variety.

We could kill that financial adviser who told her to put all her money into stocks.
15 2019-02-16 23:38:07 I feelat & understand but if yu interested yu can look into penny stocks or different stockholders apps I’m interested myself jus need do more research on the quickest way to gain interest
16 2019-02-16 23:36:53 @KamalaHarris @SenWarren 
Gun Control 
1. Enforce the Current Laws
2. Universal background check w 48 hrs waiting period 
3. Ban on Assault weapons 
4. Ban on Bump stocks 
5. Ban on high capacity magazines
Above protects 2nd Amendment, Hunting,Security & Hobby
NRA may agree too.
17 2019-02-16 23:36:48 The only lucky thing is crypto goes through the pattern in months, while stocks, being a mature asset, take years to bottom-out of a post-bubble situation...
18 2019-02-16 23:36:45 Stocks Up / Earnings Up  (45/ 58) has a 78% directional signal, while Stocks Down/ Earnings Down  (7/30) has a 23% directional signal. Markets like to go up in general.
19 2019-02-15 23:59:18 Also I spoke specifically on bump stocks as being banned. Which I haven't verified but will do so later when I have more time.
20 2019-02-15 23:58:54 It says economic downturns have a much wider impact than crashes (ie. gdp + productivity impact) than capital markets (which is stocks, commodities, and fixed income) crashes. Which is precisely what I said.

22 2019-02-15 23:58:17 Need to learn how to invest in some stocks
23 2019-02-15 23:56:09 en plus j’avais dis j’achete plus d’album sauf le prochain comeback de bangtan mais là vasy c des stocks limites bien sur que je suis allez l’acheter
24 2019-02-15 23:55:12 DO something about it then, I recently attended a gun violence townhall and it enlightened me some much on the things that are happening gun wise in this Country. If you really cared, endorse a universal background check bill, ban bump stocks and ban assault rifles.
25 2019-02-15 23:54:41 Your condolences are worthless. #gunviolenceisanationemergency kills 40,000 people/year & requires universal background checks, extreme risk protection orders, banning military style assault weapons, bump stocks & large capacity ammo devices. Talk is cheap, save lives w #gunsense
26 2019-02-15 23:54:39 Sheetz is the only place I've been in my entire life that actually stocks the changing table liners in their changing tables.
27 2019-02-15 23:54:20 I’m buying stocks on the stairclimber before I hit the steam room...when did I become an old man?!? 
28 2019-02-15 23:51:55 But it so dumb to assume that it was because of that idiotic ressa's arrest. No one person, in my experience doing stocks, can affect it.
29 2019-02-15 23:51:30 @MaverikIT @Bombay55 stocks go from 30-40 one way or another. I keep telling these rookies. Don’t let the technicals screw you out of money
30 2019-02-15 23:51:15 Maybe all the affordable homes that are empty or illegally sublet could be returned to Gov stocks and allocated to those who need them. Do you ever pause to think that  constituents are robbing their own people?
31 2019-02-15 23:50:42 In the home no. Concealed carry stops tons of crimes that would happen but don't simply by brandishing your weapon. Automatic weapons are banned, I'm pretty sure Trump banned bump stocks (not 100% on that cause I didn't follow it much), and semi-automatic would literally ban all.
32 2019-02-15 23:48:18 Though England have quality stocks in the wings, I still believe that at least against Italy he should be given a chance.
33 2019-02-15 23:47:45 Mike - stocks are going up while estimates are coming down.  Tough to justify multiple expansion unless you think the fed will cut and inflation will decline.  Thoughts?
34 2019-02-15 23:47:00 I've got this one big box thats just random c90s, a case of floppy disks i got for a steal, different label stocks, packages full of packaging, stacks of pages of old books, defunct tape machines in various stages of disrepair. Stacks of minidiscs, stacks of 128mb sd cards
35 2019-02-15 23:45:45 If you are of the opinion that stocks are now moving back into a "bad news is good news" period because it will keep rates low, you likely applauded the huge miss with Industrial Production.  Hard to explain today's move rationally.
36 2019-02-15 23:45:42 FU
37 2019-02-17 23:58:22 I took 11 stocks
38 2019-02-17 23:57:44 The city I work in just banned bump stocks...I totally destroyed mine because they asked me to do it in good faith
39 2019-02-17 23:57:42 Any ASX stocks you’re watching for uranium Alex?
40 2019-02-17 23:57:33 The greatest asset is not having stocks or equities, fixed income or bonds, money market or cash equivalents, real estate or other tangible assets. THE GREATEST ASSET is believing in YOURSELF. It might not happen today, but with hard work, consistency, and persistence YOU CAN!
41 2019-02-17 23:52:59 I think it’s better to live the fast life at a young age cause 23+ is the time period that’s honestly going to determine how the rest of your life is going to be. You can pay that club fee, waste it on overpriced drinks, etc or you can use that and invest it in stocks
42 2019-02-17 23:51:13 I like to think of it as the First Cheap candy eve of the year October and December are better but it gets your stocks up while you wait for the one with the rabbits and eggs
43 2019-02-17 23:50:21 Of like text and stocks?
44 2019-02-17 23:50:19 Hi rolling stocks are given by govt. they inherited it from Arriva. I’m quite surprise it doesn’t have it. Now I wonder if Welsh govt cares for its disability person. They only lease it. All now I hear is new trains will have it.
45 2019-02-17 23:48:56 Over long periods of time, small-cap stocks tend to significantly outperform their large-cap peers.

What’s one small-cap (sub $3B) that many investors may be sleeping on?

We’ll start... We’re big fans of Appian $APPN  and Redfin $RDFN
46 2019-02-17 23:43:57 I use it for day trading stocks. I use Finviz Elite to see the stocks that are moving big in the pre-market or that have big volume increases. And then I monitor the list after the Open to see which stocks keep moving well.
47 2019-02-17 23:40:52 Yeah, been following for 9 months. Did his profitly program for a few months. I do like the price action you get in penny stocks.

49 2019-02-17 23:40:01 All healthcare stocks took off as Obamacare became law. Not a coincidence.
50 2019-02-17 23:38:54 Acts 16:23-24

23 After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. 24 When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.
51 2019-02-17 23:38:04 Maybe I'm wrong, can't be 100% sure on any stocks, NO STOCKS PROMISSES WEALTH, CHART and L2 spoke for themselfs! If a trader got in at TOP Thrusday, they would love to have gotten out b4 it dropped to 5s, cus thats over 100% loss! Let's see if it'll climb or fall tuesday buddy!
52 2019-02-17 23:30:35 Then where are they going to get their stocks from?
53 2019-02-17 23:30:18 Stocks
54 2019-02-17 23:28:38 So Germany (let’s not get into their history), and France (weekly protests against the government), think we are laughing stocks . Meanwhile around Europe Populist Governments are taking power.
