36 2018-01-01 23:45:20 Swami, do you spend all day scanning for stocks going up then down ramp for the rest of the day. You did it with $AGY and must still be wiping the Lithium of your face. You will be made to look stupid again
37 2018-01-01 23:41:48 There was no ban on Christmas. If you didn't celebrate it for the last 8 years I feel for you. As for the stock market I've had stocks and investments for the last 20 years and they really only did poorly after 9/11. Maybe you should seek professional advice for your investments.

41 2018-01-01 23:39:23 Manipulation in crypto and stocks. But crypto is more true to human nature(charts) than stocks in my experience. That will change as algo trading increases.
42 2018-01-01 23:37:52 You need to explain to the common person that doesn’t own personal stock what the value of stock means to him/her.
Reads like only the peeps that own stocks are going to benefit.
43 2018-01-01 23:37:06 Fair point. But chart patterns are not as reliable in stocks as they are here imo.
44 2018-01-01 23:36:00 Stocks did 20% worse under Trump than Obama.

51 2018-01-01 23:32:05 Also, devices such as bump stocks turn a semi-auto into what is almost indistinguishable from full auto in terms of rate of fire.
52 2018-01-01 23:31:54 I am not talking about the big players . I am talking about 80% of the small players based on hype. Yup almost all the small stocks under 1$ retraced Jan feb while other sectors were hot. Then July the mmj is hot again. But weed will be my biggest short ever without question
53 2018-01-01 23:30:45 Stocks poised for transformative data/news in 2018 that could drive values up 100-200% or more include $AVDL (1x nightly sodium oxybate) $CNCE (deuterated ruxolitinib) $SGMO (MPS, HEMA/B, HIV, CAR T, tau) $TRIL (TTI-621) $LPTX $FGEN $RVNC $AXSM (AXS-02 AXS-05 p3s) $AITB

65 2018-01-01 23:22:24 I really like XAM and OZL on ASX for copper stocks but didn't make my top 10. Lots of great copper stocks out there.. tough to pick just 4 or 5 but a testament to the value in the space.

69 2018-01-01 23:18:52 Of course company CEO's did, they just got a huge tax break. We are no safer today than 18 months ago. Cop's every where are buying their own stock like crazy which pushes stocks up etc
70 2018-01-01 23:18:51 It’s been proven that the business use that money they save to buy their stocks and drive the prices up. They do not give it to their employees. This was just a horrible tax plan that was rushed and very disliked.

72 2018-01-01 23:15:51 Bull!  Stocks rose 28% in Obama’s first year, only 24% in Trump’s.  Fox is fake news!!!

107 2018-01-01 22:47:33 Sorry, I’m a CANSLIM guy, but buying DQ and SEDG now after parabolic moves up seems pointless. We’re supposed to capture big moves in winning stocks, not buy at the top of a parabolic move.

111 2018-01-01 22:44:57 Seems to me the smart ones were those who bought DQ at $20 in July. They are up 200% if still holding. Wouldn’t you rather find stocks before they go up 200% parabolic in 6 months rather than after?
112 2018-01-01 22:44:49 Again, let us help you understand the stock market! Now listen closely ... the market is still riding on the Obama economic legacy.  Secondly, as stocks go up it does not decrease the national debt.  It’s important for you to know that most can’t invest in stocks

He even points positive momentum is stocks!

135 2018-01-01 22:26:23 You don’t have to own stocks to own a company ? There’s plenty other ways think a bit
136 2018-01-01 22:26:11 Not bad .. we made ~$1,300,000.00 on just 1 #Cannabis stock, just this calendar year.  We own ~12 pot stocks ; and yes, I told my stream with an initial "up-in smoke" post, buying at $2+ $WEED.TO, last sold  a chunk @$32.  None of you bought, @ESOptionsSeller @Kingston_Trader DMs
137 2018-01-01 22:21:51 Sounds to me like triple witching.  Stocks, futures and options have had to deal with this for many years.
138 2018-01-01 22:19:52 There are foods for thoughts on your summarizing 2017. There are very few traders left who short over 80k stocks for long period, happy new year Phill, your views always helpful, Brother!
139 2018-01-01 22:19:52 He’s the creator for god sakes I assure you he will make money off of it . You think the owner of FB wouldn’t make money if he sold all stocks he had? Hell yea he would @SatoshiLite

141 2018-01-01 22:16:01 $JAGX proved itself to be on the rise. Time to buy into it for a small test ride. #stockstowatch #stocks
142 2018-01-01 22:12:30 HE being softened up for a 20% reduction? Pensions fund is buggered and VCs being dragged to the stocks. Looks like the game is on
143 2018-01-01 22:11:14 Becky, lives on Abalone Ave with 3 roommates.

Put all their savings into banana stocks. Can't retire.
144 2018-01-01 22:10:44 I had such an in-depth conversation about stocks last night 
145 2018-01-01 22:10:33 Each player will start with a traditional 50 stocks, or 'lives',
146 2018-01-01 22:10:16 It's amazing you have to ask this question. Democrats create more wealth - eg six years of higher job creation under #BarackObama - stocks surging on rumors of ludicrous corporate tax cuts isn't wealth. It's debatable whether #Daesh is better off 1/2
147 2018-01-01 22:10:00 Last week's range in the Dow was 164 points, or 0.7%, compared to the average weekly range in 2017 of 1.4%. It was the 1st time since 25 Nov 1983 that the Dow had posted a weekly of <0.8% for 2 weeks in a row. The run has not extended to 3 weeks for at least 46 years #stocks
148 2018-01-01 22:09:35 If our POTUS is so bad why are my stocks finally UP 9.5%? Thanks @realDonaldTrump for MAGA! You are exactly what America needs! #HappyNewYear #2a #Vets1st 
149 2018-01-01 22:09:19 Use Pivot Points as an overlay on a 5-min chart when getting in a trade. Aim for long entries under R3 and shorts above S3. $STUDY #stocks
150 2018-01-01 22:09:05 Grow a $1,000 account by 50% (which EVERY) trader has done.. every month for the year, you'll make over $100k (which only 1-2% of us have done). Nice target to set for the year tho $study $stocks
151 2018-01-01 22:09:05 Alcaholic beverage stocks and Fireworks stocks would go through the roof - all else being equal insurance stocks would get crushed - probably more than bev stocks ramp (unless Janet is buying)
152 2018-01-01 22:08:39 Pace extended through 2021. Putting our stocks in him. The drafting has been solid, free agents will need to get better overall. 

Despite disappointment, I like the core we have, and I’m going to keep the faith this can come together. Big offseason coming. #Bears
153 2018-01-01 22:07:04 An educated guess is more definitive. Just like with any technical analysis. Stocks, FOREX, assets like Gold or Silver... they are all speculated upon with technical analysis of past price action. Learn to read the charts, and you can be REALLY good at guessing.
154 2018-01-01 22:06:58 not bluechips you will be so bored. you want like canadain marijuana companies. Some stocks are as volitile as crypto so you will still be having a good time :)
155 2018-01-01 22:05:44 I would do so of the old blue Chip stocks put them in a iraroth for long term
156 2018-01-01 22:05:42 When u buy BTC u own digits on a screen. When u own stocks, u own digits on a screen, not certificates. We are in an etheric bubble loaded with untenable amounts of counterparty risk. Gold is the opposite of all this idiocy. When it pops, Gold will be the antidote

158 2018-01-01 22:01:28 No, stocks mean trading or not. Sales would show signs of failing or not. That is another Trump success, his arguments with them have people reading them.
159 2018-01-01 22:01:25 What does Hillary have to do with this??? Obama’s the reason stocks are up
160 2018-01-01 22:00:45 For your enlightenment, the best practices is where  govt provide enabling environment, tagged in policies, infrastructure, etc, for Private sector to thrive. Indirectly, govt can claim this as an achievement! US stocks are gaining, Trump is claim  it as his policy-works! #Logic
161 2018-01-01 22:00:34 While I agree with the observation that it is very difficult to use past patterns as prediction tools, our prop model is nearing an initial equity sell signal. Model has been long since mid 2016. A good Jan and/or Feb for #stocks could trigger the signal. $spy
162 2018-01-01 22:00:12 Heh, christmas gift ko is buying stocks for myself.

Bye bye $500. I will see you back in 15 years.
163 2018-01-01 21:57:47 Janice if you had any stocks you would not say he is squandering our wealth.  I think you have just been corrupted by the fake news. Get educated before you post.
164 2018-01-01 21:55:24 I took a look but am filled up on high float stocks. Good luck.

169 2018-01-01 21:47:02 Health Insurance stocks, which we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT
170 2018-01-01 21:46:03 Fava Bean stocks are also up.
171 2018-01-01 21:45:50 I've not properly played on a while so this is the first time in several months. I tend to float back to Diaganduri. Good shipyard, stocks most modules, Li Yong Rui discount on stuff

173 2018-01-01 21:44:34 #ASX will start of slowly as trading re-commences with plenty of bargains to be had in the right areas. Take advantage of the early weak buying leading up to mid-January when volume arrives rewarding patient traders. Pick the low hanging fruit in the meantime. #GoodLuck #stocks
174 2018-01-01 21:41:41 Ahh, but the old polling math no longer applies to Trump. Just like P/E ratios were irrelevant in evaluating tech stocks in 1999.

181 2018-01-01 21:33:04 Shitcoin advice is the modern equivalent of being passed a copy of Screw under a bathroom stall door with a classified ad for penny stocks circled. “Wow, great tip, thanks.”
182 2018-01-01 21:32:25 To the mainstreamers, "right" = anything that causes stocks to go up in the short-term. It doesn't matter if you completely trash the real economy when the boom turns to bust. It's "right" because their Scottrade account is up $3,000!
183 2018-01-01 21:31:42 It's a matter of US National Security that they get those returns - US consumer spending & therefore US tax receipts will collapse, which will force either internal (entitlement) or external (UST's) default barring Fed hyper-monetization.  I.e. the USD must fall v. stocks.

186 2018-01-01 21:29:58 And if you think about it, what you've just said isn't really relevant at all. It is relevant, however, in that it instantly wiped billions of the value of all UK stocks.
187 2018-01-01 21:27:52 54% of Americans have stocks!
188 2018-01-01 21:27:40 In relation to stocks, my goal is 2.5% per day. I've hit that in October and November
189 2018-01-01 21:25:37 Any of y’all know about stocks I got a couple questions
190 2018-01-01 21:25:34 You are right! Probably more so than penny stocks and forex. I need to get my wife involved.
191 2018-01-01 21:25:06 Spat his dummy here Taylor just lobbing darts about like he’s in stocks on a Friday
192 2018-01-01 21:24:50 Happy New Year and hopefully some New Life for the Sleeping Penny Stocks!

194 2018-01-01 21:21:49 That’s figure when broken down means 30M a year based on today’s numbers. Probably even more if their stocks take off. So for a politically correct gesture he is willing to put state retirees funds at risk.
That’s the Dems playbook.
195 2018-01-01 21:21:24 I get the reason why, publicly held and traded companies that tweet out any information that raise or lower their stock prices should be held accountable to the SEC.  That way people don't hedge those stocks.
196 2018-01-01 21:21:06 If you want healthy grocery for your wellness goal, @HealthnHealthy1 stocks. 
Pancake mix (whole grain /low carb/gluten free)
natural sugar free granola

204 2018-01-01 21:14:29 The wall is also really stupid in execution. He didn't have a huge effect on illegal immigration look at your statistics it's been on a downtrend since the Bush years. American stocks are rising because of a global economic trend it would of happened regardless of who won.

210 2018-01-01 21:11:36 The best advise I can give people, invest in yourself and stocks. Any amount of money you get make sure it is put to good use even If it’s $5. I want everybody to be successful, get your bag this year fuck the doubters.

215 2018-01-01 21:07:21 Forget about the stocks. It was all the unrealized wealth that suddenly wasn't going to be realized. Same thing now. Most crypto buyers aren't HODLers and don't actually think it's "real." A crash is when they all head for the exits.

217 2018-01-01 21:05:22 correct, it's why i love you noobs from penny stocks and why i bought 1% last year for $2000. That's $23M today thx! Shit even Feb you could buy that much. Next one for you is $LDOGE. Buy that! it's sub-satoshi. You'd love it since you only care about $ & low coin price not value

239 2018-01-01 20:40:18 What stocks? Your stocks?
240 2018-01-01 20:39:03 This is also my issue. I can buy the dip like nothing.... So easy to just keep on buying....hard to take profits as you think the stocks could keep on going up for ever
241 2018-01-01 20:38:57 I really want to learn about stocks and investing. I literally know nothing about it right now and I mean NOTHING. Anybody have any resources for beginners?
242 2018-01-01 20:38:55 Stocks were already on the rise well before you took office under a Democrat  ! You can't continue to take credit for everything  !
243 2018-01-01 20:38:30 I think the USD will potentially go up to 97/100 region. Before heading down longer term. That should be positive for US stocks. And positive for gold. Without having a neg impact to the global economy
244 2018-01-01 20:38:01 not applicable to @savestacks positions and I hesitate to write it but I can point out 100's if not 1000's of stocks I have seen that were going to be the next $100 co that have gone banko or now trade for pennies,

247 2018-01-01 20:35:53 I think 2018 will mean we have more crypto currencies than stocks.  I also think that limited supply argument makes no sense at all unless you only believe in one coin and one fork and that's like saying there is a limited supply of open source software.
248 2018-01-01 20:35:25 I lived through the dotcom bust in 00/01, and people agreed b/c it was such a concentrated large fall in tech stocks. What would that signal "look like" in this market: A 10% (even 20%) fall in prices is "meh". Maybe market cap based measures, or the number of ICO filings?

251 2018-01-01 20:32:43 Ok let's revisit this than at the end of 2018..   real rates of the 30Y seem quite stable..  but as mentioned I think 10y is more important, i.e. also as yield to compare P/E to..  given the outlook of contained inflation and interest rates even lower stocks up gold sideways..

256 2018-01-01 20:26:24 I just opened my TFSA about 2 months ago and basically just loaded up with the stocks that I have the most confidence in for 2018, $FAT & $LG as well as a small amount of another stock or two that are a bit more of a risk in my opinion, but I basically plan to hold it all long.
257 2018-01-01 20:25:54 I guess my question is whether it is allowed by US brokers (Ameritrade, Etrade, RobinHood, Scottrade, etc) to trade US stocks while located in a foreign country.
258 2018-01-01 20:25:31 Um, because he is a grossly repellent human being? Also, top 10% own almost all stocks, so Wall Street boom has limited relevance.
259 2018-01-01 20:24:44 Guess who just woke up to selling my stocks for 536% of what I paid for them 
260 2018-01-01 20:24:00 $RS and $MATX. Probably it is time to sell.

261 2018-01-01 20:23:11 It’s funny everyone now starting to talk about Mj stocks, once the crowd is on it that’s when you short em bruh lol
262 2018-01-01 20:22:48 U.S. stocks slip at end of strong year: duh! People take their losing stocks and sell at end of year generally putting pressure on sales push 
I would expect big gains early in January
263 2018-01-01 20:21:31 I work in stocks that was the biggest bust, I warned many people, most didn’t listen sadly
264 2018-01-01 20:21:25 Fuck it. It's 2018 time to buy some stocks
265 2018-01-01 20:21:12 Tea stocks have just increased
266 2018-01-01 20:20:58 Him and that Green idiot are the laughing stocks of the world
267 2018-01-01 20:20:34 1/2   Funny thing about manufacturing..companies don't build plants or add jobs because they get a tax cut.,the tax cuts to corporations will go to share holders and to buy back stocks...the only thing that causes companies to add jobs is demand..and even then, they only add jobs
268 2018-01-01 20:20:03 LOL, ya my wife has told me a few times she's not interested in stocks. Even after all the news saying sky high stocks, she hasn't asked me how the account is doing.   Will be interesting when I finally tell here where its at...once its more stablized
269 2018-01-01 20:19:42 Two years and 3 months later he had his brains blown out by a southerner with a gun.

You still accept NRA money after Las Vegas? How about really buckling down and focusing on bump stocks. Lincoln would have. But, then again, he was a real leader. He wasn't in it for limo rides.

271 2018-01-01 20:19:29 Excellent analysis on $GILD!  I loved your combination probability and expected growth rates for potential outcomes.  What are your thoughts on #Debt being over 50% of #assets?

272 2018-01-01 20:18:36 Lets see!  13 million drop off the health insurance roles.  Premiums for the insured to rise 25% in 2018 followed by double digit rises in the following years.  Medicare cost rise by 30% to cover all the uninsured that need medical care.  I'm buying health care stocks ASAP 
273 2018-01-01 20:17:38 Oh it’s been a tough one
274 2018-01-01 20:17:11 You think it US will see the DOW blow up at least 20% - what you play the whole market or just some stocks? Also I am trying to understand impact on Europe / ROW - could be very negative
275 2018-01-01 20:15:53 1. #US boom can be bigger IF #economy holds (would be Top 100 #stocks plus 20%)
2. US bombing #NorthKorea? No certain - Lots of posing, maybe small strike at rocket or chemical weapons plant.
3. #Greece: GER may pay more (to #banks) to ensure profits for #DAX.

284 2018-01-01 20:09:32 2018 is the year of prosperity. My goal is to come back home, move into my new home, start college, invest more stocks, add a civic into my car collection. Find out on the next episode of Dragon Ball Z if I do make it.
285 2018-01-01 20:08:48 So Pakistan is completely up for sale in penny stocks very soon. UN should take over the possession of Nuclear weapons of Pakistan in safe custody immediately as it’s a global threat. Pakistan may become another North Korea funded by Chinese to harass America.

287 2018-01-01 20:07:55 Cryptocurrencies need a different symbol than the "$" sign on Twitter to distinguish it from stocks. Plus I thought we were trying to move beyond fiat anyways!

288 2018-01-01 20:07:31 Could you please share some multibagger stocks for this year
289 2018-01-01 20:07:31 many of you have to realize most microcap MJ stocks have not even generated revenues yet,  $chv is one of the few exceptions out there with incoming revenue of roughly 4 to 6 million as well as steady growth of patients on a monthly basis.
290 2018-01-01 20:07:29 I bought euroTex two years ago its not doing good for the past two quarters, so got rid of it ..was that a blunder, any hint at better stocks to make a new entry in textile
291 2018-01-01 20:06:00 If you can’t convince yourself “When I’m down 25 percent, I’m a buyer” and banish forever the fatal thought “When I’m down 25 percent, I’m a seller,” then you’ll never make a decent profit in stocks. - Peter Lynch
292 2018-01-01 20:05:51 Crypto twitter is the new equivalent of the 90s when people were pumping penny stocks in forums and newsletters! Well the ugly part. Tons of information and a way to learn about ins and outs of the industry following developers, etc.
293 2018-01-01 20:05:40 Sounds like she bought stocks that could assist with building it  or owns a  company that wants to receive Federal taxpayers money.

No logical intelligence is shown by her except if she has her hand in the cookie jar
294 2018-01-01 20:04:32 Some of yalls pro stocks atleast need some green
295 2018-01-01 20:04:15 @IntensityStocks love the chart and it’s so true with traditional stocks! But coins are lil less predictable and much more volatile-

298 2018-01-01 19:59:39 Appalling. Those Responsible need placing in the local "Stocks" Definitely need to be shown in Public who they are and subsequently insulted as they have insulted the Public.
299 2018-01-01 19:58:58 We need some pro stocks on there
300 2018-01-01 19:58:05 If it’s not about money, stocks, business investment or all the above please go away. I need to double my Worth this year.

302 2018-01-01 19:56:10 Most middle class & the homeless dont buy stocks. The rich do and the more money they make the more they can buy on the stock market. Just making them richer. Never understood why nobody pointed this out before.

306 2018-01-01 19:52:24 Come, now. No need for that. 

Does the AM who made the comparison to Iceland support an independent Wales joining the EU? If so the comparison is odd: Iceland, like Norway, has stayed out of the EU (and thrived) mainly to protect its fish stocks, as we ought to have done.
307 2018-01-01 19:51:09 My customers love me, I’ve been told by the store owners that I work twice as hard as anyone else and that they lose sales when I’m not at work, and yet I only make fifty cents an hour more than the guy who stocks shelves (and isn’t very good at it).
308 2018-01-01 19:50:46 My stock account is very happy with him.  Why do you think Kanye bought Kim stocks for Christmas, he knows this is the time to make money in the market!  Thanks, President Trump @realDonaldTrump !

311 2018-01-01 19:49:16 Et ce que disait c’est qu’il se peut que la go à des tubes en stocks depuis plus d’un an mais ils se tournent les pouces, ils préfèrent investir dans les nouvelles weaves d’Ariana Grande que de la laisser sortir des sons et ce n’est pas juste
312 2018-01-01 19:48:32 Caught a stray dog today on Stocks Hill in Ecclesfield. Was a nervous little thing and we only got a lead on it (a makeshift bit of blue rope) after it went into someone's garden.
313 2018-01-01 19:46:00 Socialism is not progressive and cannot work in a free, independent society...under 'Trumpism',  YOU earned more from your stocks. Under 'Trumpism', most of your devoted followers will get to keep more of their $$ this year.
314 2018-01-01 19:45:20 Oh boy am I glad I’m not back at work until Thursday  hope everyone else really enjoys their first day back though
315 2018-01-01 19:39:22 Take full and personal responsibility for your finances.
316 2018-01-01 19:39:09 The Stocks app you are able to delete. Do you remember if the 6 Plus had 3D touch? If so you should be able to hold down on an app or folder until it starts wiggling on the home screen. If the app can be uninstalled, there will be a gray X in the upper left corner.
317 2018-01-01 19:39:02 Welcome to America's future. If you don't participate at least educate yourself and diversify your portfolio with some marijuana stocks.
318 2018-01-01 19:38:41 The situation I'm talking about is a timid fan who's being made to feel bad for liking what he likes. If I like Justin Bieber music and I just want to buy a Justin Bieber CD I shouldn't be made to feel bad about it by a music store that stocks Justin Bieber CDs.
319 2018-01-01 19:38:33 We don’t trade crypto for clients. We advise clients. We trade stocks for clients.

321 2018-01-01 19:37:00 rather he has kept a ton of promises...lowered taxes....coal stocks and jobs created.....

Trump's greatest weopon is that he is dismissed and underestimated.
322 2018-01-01 19:36:39 you are a sick man and have an egotistic character you don't care about your people only about your stocks, and the illegal voters and criminals i hope they living before house but they don't because you call the police they can live everywhere but before your house #KateSteinle
323 2018-01-01 19:36:35 2018 has so much going in my horizon already. Moving to Washington, getting raises, our stocks come in, tax returns, one more year left on our car note, work promotions and much more. This year I will not waste on being sad about my past and what has happened.
324 2018-01-01 19:36:27 I had the 6 Plus and I couldn't delete reminders, maps, find my iPhone, stocks, news, and some other stuff
325 2018-01-01 19:35:45 Again... 3 weeks ago the coin was less that $0.01... Learn how to hold - not even just coins. People buy stocks of fortune 500 cos and sell as soon as the price begins to drop when meanwhile the price turns out to increase 1000% if they'd learn to hold for years or even months
326 2018-01-01 19:35:26 It seems that $WTM and $PCH may go up.

340 2018-01-01 19:22:29 I would just add that questioning whether someone should stay in a position isn't necessarily dehumanizing. If a CEO were tanking his shareholders' stocks publicly calling for job seems reasonable.
341 2018-01-01 19:20:50 Just wait for few hours Anuragji. Pakistan will come up with a theory accusing CIA,MOSSAD & RAW & term this as an attack against Islam. Terrorists will go mad & yell from podium thinking their voice reaches Oval Office in real time. 
Penny stocks Pakistan is up for sale soon.
342 2018-01-01 19:20:46 They pumped up the prices of share in the stocks market up to the New year's eve then started the Iran conspiracy on the holidays on the closing times of the market. Iran might attacks Saudi Arabia in response so the stocks market might collapse. #Timing

349 2018-01-01 19:17:27 Like the honesty of this post - suffered the same problem with large defensive stocks including GSK, AZN and largest holding NG. Also LGEN and PSN. Think they’ll outperform next year and beyond
350 2018-01-01 19:17:06 I’m not for taking away guns from every person but regulations are necessary loopholes need to be closed. Bump stocks need to be illegal
351 2018-01-01 19:16:40 The culprit needs to be found & taken to the town hall & be thrown in stocks before being beaten with a big stick,with six inch nails in it of course.

357 2018-01-01 19:10:29 This will mean a lot less information and discussion overall, although it will also prevent people from talking their book. Whether stocks were moving b/c "anonymous Twitter account!" is a good question.

377 2018-01-01 18:54:55 Stock prices will more than likely be higher in 2018 due to lower corporate taxes. If you don’t own stocks, I highly recommend buying some. You can get started with as little as $1.
378 2018-01-01 18:54:21 That will be good for the economy????
More GDP from ambulances, body bag makers, rehab facilities, etc.
Stocks will keep going up...
The kind of thing politicians looooove for our nation...
379 2018-01-01 18:53:20 It should also be enough to demonstrate to the morons why the Second Amendment is critical to the survival of a free people.

382 2018-01-01 18:51:14 @DUCKmagstoke Go back to the days when people were put in the stocks and have rotten fruit pelted at them. I know that's going a bit too far, but it's how I feel after today's poor performance.
383 2018-01-01 18:51:14 My 2018 predictions: reits lower, domestic stocks lower, international/emerging lower, oil higher, gold higher, btc lower
384 2018-01-01 18:50:44 Only the well to do have the ability to buy stocks.  We also do not have the advantage of early purchase or insider trading.  What a joke.
385 2018-01-01 18:49:12 Forget bitcoin, where's the beer pong table stocks at? Bills mafia will make me rich
386 2018-01-01 18:48:50 What happens if the Bail in law is passed by the parliament? The FDs & Bonds will be converted to bank stocks at prices fixed by RBI. With our inefficient banking system, the owners of the bank stock will neither get any dividend nor the principal. Thanks to Congress misrule.
387 2018-01-01 18:48:24 What a politically sugar coated tweet ! How any one can force people into stocks? India is way behind when compared with other large economy in terms of MF to GDP ratio, u know it and yet twisting it to misguide people. It won't work, please note
388 2018-01-01 18:47:12 Agreed. If a publicly traded company misses a projection or deadline when their quarterly report comes out their stock is punished for it. These “coins” are just like stocks and should probably start running the biz behind them then as such.
389 2018-01-01 18:47:07 Let's be honest, American police have always been known to be trigger happy even when you couldn't buy AR-15s from Wal-Mart and bump stocks with next day delivery on the internet.
390 2018-01-01 18:46:59 As per usual, my resolutions for the new year include the following: 
- Invest in cool socks (not stocks)          
- Eat my greens                                          
- Change world order
391 2018-01-01 18:46:50 As many know me, I’m not really a day trader that goes in and out of stocks the same day, I rarely do that. I’m a investor that buy and hold stocks for maximum profits, holding $CSSI AUTHENTATRADE updates didn’t even started hitting but I do know traders who sold, their lost
392 2018-01-01 18:45:29 The 10 best performing biotech stocks of 2017 all lost money for the year. Put that into your pipe & smoke it!
393 2018-01-01 18:45:15 read the charts exactly the same. But its much easier than stocks lol. Buy the dips and consolidations. Start small. add dips sell rips. literally that easy.
394 2018-01-01 18:45:01 Bills qualify for playoffs with victory in Miami, ending longest active playoff drought, That, of course, is to be expected, since the least-risky stocks tend to outperform during nasty short-term selloffs. #OutbackBowl #orbitingastrologists
395 2018-01-01 18:45:00 Been reading that Uber Airbnb and Amazon might start taking ripple because of how much supply there is and won't make the same mistake as Bitcoin where the resource becomes scarce....
396 2018-01-01 18:42:16 Allen, do you chart crypto currencies the way you chart stocks?
397 2018-01-01 18:41:09 We're back open tomorrow... with limited stocks due to the Christmas / new year period. Normal service will resume as the week goes on.
398 2018-01-01 18:37:17 I don't think as much of the bigger post-tax income of wealthy will actually go into real investment but land and stocks (leading to bubbles and a crash).
399 2018-01-01 18:35:19 As we start updating our Top #Cannabis Stock list for 2018, send us YOUR opinion on what you feel will be the Top Gainers in 2018 and why.

400 2018-01-01 18:34:38 HEY POUTIN’ DON. YOU TWEET. YOU LIE. You have no way of knowing what would have happened. Just like now. You have no influence on stocks. Your MASSIVE EGO makes you think everything involves you. You tweet all day? Every other tweet I get is you. DON’T YOU HAVE ANY WORK TO DO?
401 2018-01-01 18:34:27 Is their anyone who knows about stocks and investing in trades?
402 2018-01-01 18:34:24 All these acronyms for a millennial pump and dump scheme! #wolfofwallstreet #xvg is a scam just like some penny stocks
403 2018-01-01 18:34:13 Urgent ! Cherche mec pour manger une raclette . J’en ai acheté 10 fois trop je dois ecouler les stocks 
404 2018-01-01 18:33:47 Wish my job paid me in clout instead of stocks
405 2018-01-01 18:33:14 This is funny considering the majority of Americans don't own stocks. He's only helping the wealthy.
406 2018-01-01 18:32:58 Stocks matter to 20% of Americans. 80%don't care. Are you president for all Americans or only those with money in Wall Street? I'd like to see you give more than lip service and empty promises to the other 80%.
407 2018-01-01 18:31:44 The corps get the $870 also. Every dime goes back into the economy. Food clothing shelter heat assistance healthcare etc. The needy aren’t sitting on it in stocks & bonds. The Walmart heirs are among the riches in the country, they never talk about cutting social benefits.
408 2018-01-01 18:31:14 Actually about 50% of Americans own stock directly or indirectly. The richest 10% own 84% of stocks. The other half, Trump supporters, hold the shit end of the stick.

410 2018-01-01 18:29:56 That would amount to quite a lot, but with my approach you'd never be invested in either stocks or gold for over 46 years straight. You'd be switching between gold and stocks once every 10-20 years.
411 2018-01-01 18:29:47 Fantastic year STOCKS ARE HITTING RECORDS! JOBS ARE GREAT!LAW AND ORDER COMING BACK!GREAT CONSERVATIVE JUDGES.FAKE NEWS LOSING.INFRASTRUCTURE NEXT! STILL HAVE TO GET REAL HEALTHCARE...BUILD THAT WALL! MAGA IS HUMMING ALONG.Finally, a HAPPY NEW YEARDEMS DOWN 1000 SEATS
412 2018-01-01 18:29:40 No he traded Forex. Trading stocks depends on your time frame, because of the time delay.
413 2018-01-01 18:29:26 1 year ago we felt $OWCP would be the Top #Cannabis Stock of 2017.

$OWCP opened the year at $0.1815 & ended at $0.4546 for a Annual Gain of 150.47%.

$OWCP peaked at $3.23, for a gain of 1,679.6%.

We truly believe 2018 will be even better.

418 2018-01-01 18:25:33 I agree but it does seem that crypto currency currently is more safe than stocks. Factors to push the value of crypto currency down are few and weak.
419 2018-01-01 18:24:05 Seems like lots of wannabes jumping into the fray to make a quick buck. 

Behaving like tech stocks not based on real business dynamics but speculation instead. 

Making a bubble. What happens when everyone cashes in since there is nothing real behind these schemes?
420 2018-01-01 18:23:56 Just because you are making money off stocks doesn’t mean the rest of the country is becoming ‘great again’.
421 2018-01-01 18:23:48 people forget apple is a music company as much as it is a tech company  stocks up!

423 2018-01-01 18:23:15 Finished the year with 41 stocks so choosing 5 for this year was incredibly hard. I’m targeting 15% +  for 1/ CTG 2/FST 3/ANP 4/ RFX 5/ NMD
424 2018-01-01 18:22:52 The fact, that stocks (with dividends reinvested) are performing quite stable and that Gold is nowhere near to such a performance over the long run.
425 2018-01-01 18:22:35 Cooler Master quand vous voulez vous réapprovisionner vos stocks
426 2018-01-01 18:22:29 I don't see @NintendoAmerica  cares what I said. Do you have stocks or something?
427 2018-01-01 18:21:43 1. Don't buy stocks on margin.
2.
428 2018-01-01 18:21:12 I feel, and maybe I'm not alone, that he is only speaking to those who do own stocks. "His people" the rich. Another indication how far removed Trump is from MY WORLD. Another reason he is not my President.
429 2018-01-01 18:20:59 You need to clean up your own country! Don't worry about ours! We're well on our way! #maga stocks up, tax reform, jobs coming back! God is Great!
430 2018-01-01 18:20:32 What specifically is record setting? Stocks, GDP,  ?
431 2018-01-01 18:20:19 You’re not using facts to argue with state-run Fox Entertainment are you?  You know better than that Matt.  Happy New Year Brother.  PS - my ‘pot stocks’ are thru the roof despite the Trump/Sessions effort to demonize them.  Idiots!
432 2018-01-01 18:20:14 I’ll probably invest that money in some cryptocurrency and some cheap stocks
433 2018-01-01 18:20:14 Und falls Ihnen nach den Feiertagen der ständige Puls der Märkte schon ein wenig fehlt - keine Sorge, morgen geht's wieder los mit den #stocks!
434 2018-01-01 18:20:08 As with stocks, the height of speculative frenzies and the bottoms of bear markets are times when "low quality" thrives. Is there such a thing as "ethical trading" if the near term is a zero-sum game?
435 2018-01-01 18:19:42 The guns, that's the real estate, the  stocks & bonds, artwork. You know shit that appreciates with value
What's the butter ? Cars, clothes, jewelry & all that other bullshit that don't mean shit after you buy it! 
That is what it's all about, guns & butter baby!
436 2018-01-01 18:18:56 an electronic currency called Bitsomething that's only a thin wrapper around very volatile stocks
437 2018-01-01 18:17:56 Stocks? You are so out of touch with the average American in this country. Most have no 401K, no stocks, can't afford medication, food or decent housing. They are not checking the Wall Street Journal for stock value.
438 2018-01-01 18:15:38 Have to approach it like investing - cant just pick one or two stocks & hope for short term gains. Go all in across the DEM board for the long-term returns.
439 2018-01-01 18:15:35 I've been studying DRIPs and am fascinated how the "boring" stocks perform.
440 2018-01-01 18:15:25 So how long am I allowed to continue to drink every night and consume chocolate? Until stocks run out? Until we go back to work? (Darn, that's tomorrow). As long as my body will cope with it?
441 2018-01-01 18:15:09 A few stocks  I think will surprise people and multibag soon #NKTN #LION #THR
442 2018-01-01 18:14:30 OBAMA got stocks rising and he is reason market is high today. You are too stupid o have done anything except hate and bigotry
443 2018-01-01 18:13:53 Stocks are great & were great because 0f President Obama not you. Of course your supporters are to stupid to believe facts. 2018 will be a great year because Muller is coming for you and your family.
444 2018-01-01 18:13:34 still hate French stocks (distribution taxes) ...
445 2018-01-01 18:13:32 Presently Asian stocks are best, but lately got S&P 500 buy. Palladium, Gasoil, Brent crude, Heating Oil are other components right now. Gold is a discretionary (small) long and added silver more recently. Long also Euro and GBP. When and IF Gold starts performing I get signal.
446 2018-01-01 18:13:09 Some of the cryptocurrencies will survive but only to be used by a few percentage of the world. In the end we will have digital assets , gold, land, stocks etc.. which offers a far better value than a digital number. And we will start using these digital assets.

451 2018-01-01 18:08:33 En ce qui concerne les frais de port et les délais de livraison, il y a apparemment de plus en plus de sociétés chinoises qui s'organisent pour avoir des stocks en Europe, afin notamment de réduire les délais de livraison qui atteignent fréquemment 30 à 45 jours.
452 2018-01-01 18:07:14 Wow you should buy a lottery ticket or like, stocks, TODAY.

454 2018-01-01 18:06:21 Trying so hard to follow stocks and make my money work for me. But so far I’ve lost money... this shit is confusing. I need to take an accounting class or something.
455 2018-01-01 18:05:41 Not sitting by stocks on the plane thank god
456 2018-01-01 18:04:56 6mo from now or sooner well no what stocks goin todo if Inflation starts heatup & $Fed raises rates this is how business cycle works $SPY
457 2018-01-01 18:04:30 20 is a lot! but not unmanageable. 
I'm not even at 20 between crypto, commodities and stocks and I want to pare it down.
458 2018-01-01 18:04:03 And I'm not entirely sure what facts I am not realizing here? You haven't really presented anything that I didn't already know. Sure, stocks including dividends outperform gold in the long run. That doesn't say anything about the next 5-10 years though.
459 2018-01-01 18:03:37 Large cap stocks are relatively cheap today with more predictable revenue streams for next few yrs in businesses where size of opportunity is huge along with capital efficiency. Stick to established businesses. Avoid highly overvalued midcap and small cap stocks/MF’s/ PMS
460 2018-01-01 18:02:58 Going to be diverse this year with my money. 80% of my funds was in mmj 2017. Sold 60% of my holdings. Most mmj stocks will see a 2x maybe 3x 2018 if legalization goes . But I like the 5x 10x 20x and they are coming watch
461 2018-01-01 18:02:24 Hi MG good Q!  Hold a few that are top performers from @reb40 ‘s survey: #XLM #IQE etc but bought in to both late. Had a few blow ups like #PFG #RBG. Some solid stocks like #GSK #CNA disappointed. Like good Comedy it’s all about the timing!  Buy sooner, dump sooner!
462 2018-01-01 18:02:08 Just how many people living at the poverty line or below have stocks? Again you prove you only care about the 1%. A president should help all the citizens. #Impeach45
463 2018-01-01 18:01:16 I am only a gold bug in the sense that I plan to exchange my gold for stocks once the stock/gold ratio troughs. After the trough I'm a stock bug. The point of this excercise is not to get crushed on a real basis while owning stocks for 2 decades, hence the cycles in that ratio.
464 2018-01-01 17:59:35 No crazy like a fox in the hen house.unemployment at a 17 low people getting off food stamps stocks setting all time record's be positive life is good
465 2018-01-01 17:58:34 @markminervini Mark, just finished listening to your interview w/Michael Covel. He discussed Richard Love’s book and referenced 2 year, 300% moves in stocks, but nothing further was said about this. Can you confirm that the biggest winners in history first move 300% over 2 years?
466 2018-01-01 17:58:25 I trust very  long on Tesla. Very good decision to have Tesla Stocks.
467 2018-01-01 17:58:08 That's wonderful for people who can afford stocks. The poverty stricken people of your country need your help Mr. President. What about us? You cut 25 BILLION dollars from Medicare. Without Medicare I have no insurance. I worked many years.
468 2018-01-01 17:57:48 Actually, those negative tweets are excellent buying opportunities for good companies. These price drops are temporary and most of those slandered stocks have recovered well. Boeing and AT&T were two of the best performing company stocks of 2017. #resist #bluewave 
469 2018-01-01 17:56:43 I want my cousin to show me how to really invest into stocks
470 2018-01-01 17:56:16 #Bitcoin is an eventual replacement for Cash. A more efficient version could become the Globo, & beneficial to developing countries.

#Etherium is a replacement for Stocks & Bonds, and other contracts that are Securities. Insurance, etc.
471 2018-01-01 17:55:25 Greet paper to start the year on. Will it matter for 2018? Many IBD50 stocks are trading below 50dma since tax bill & some of the extended leading FANGs are fading as well. Can't wait to see how the week goes following Friday moves in equities/VIX. BTFD or get the hell out?
472 2018-01-01 17:55:16 That was Obama running up the debt more than all the president's put to gather unemployment at a 17 year low people getting off food stamps stocks setting all time record's rebuilding enter structure
473 2018-01-01 17:54:51 Good question.  I have found these groups and the stocks in these groups really outperform groups below that minimum threshold. And I  always want great earning and/or sale #'s too.

484 2018-01-01 17:45:49 The issue wasn't that stocks outperform over very long time frames. The issue was whether or not they beat gold recently, which they did not. What remains to be seen is whether they will beat gold in the near future. We obviously disagree. How about we revisit this argument later

503 2018-01-01 17:31:44 You are an idiot. I contribute 10% of my salary into a 401k which is mutual funds, not individual stocks. Stick to sports because you don’t seem to understand anything else. And if you don’t have retirement savings you are screwed because Trump and the GOP are going after SS
504 2018-01-01 17:31:27 Futures trading already taken that inyo account. Listing will only mean larger market cap and there is no short selling like stocks

512 2018-01-01 17:27:57 Nick, since we both have similar longevity and thoughts, the general themes obviously can’t be that different. 
Stocks retracement accompanied with higher vola always on the radar, higher yields, esp BTPs a nobrainer, $ (also driven by ECB taper) led CMDTYs

514 2018-01-01 17:25:47 Some people don't have stocks like the rich. I become disabled and had to leave work. Now I love totally on social security. I hope you guys don't cut social security promised. Happy New Year. I truly hope that 2018 will be a great year.
515 2018-01-01 17:25:03 Most Trump voters do not own stocks and also will not benefit from other T initiatives - we need to keep hope alive and be kind as this national trauma plays out- Vote in 2018

520 2018-01-01 17:22:45 I have some stocks that look like they could work now,  $IPI $VRX but most likely my biggest winner next year is not on my radar yet.  $AAOI wasn't at this time Las year.
521 2018-01-01 17:21:51 My father has an arsenal of collectors gun parts, gun stocks, hand guns, bayonets etc. All for sale at gun shows. There will be little positive outcome labeling gun collectors “Trump terrorists”. It will not shame them, it will only embolden them. Find another way to connect.

523 2018-01-01 17:20:51 2017 was a stellar year for stocks with all three major indices recording their best year since 2013.  Regardless of the headwind, be it economic or political, it seemed like nothing could stop the markets march to record high after record high.

526 2018-01-01 17:20:04 This past year has been terrific at Capital Wealth Planning due to the diligence and excellent performance of our team. We rolled out a beta version of a new covered call strategy focusing on growth stocks, had an Independent Performance Verification and more.
527 2018-01-01 17:19:23 Hey Lou, you’re right. Anyone on social security, Medicare, Medicaid, or those that have aging parents will not vote for DT.  Those with morals won’t vote for him. I have a 401k a few stocks & I won’t vote for him !

549 2018-01-01 17:07:13 #CryptoCurrencies like #BTC #ETH and #LTC are not stocks. The inventors such as @SatoshiLite are not CEOs.  People would be far better off spending their time learning about the world-changing effects of this technology than arguing why someone sold their "coins". #HODL

553 2018-01-01 17:04:56 entering 2017 it was all about Marijuana stocks/ AI, self driving cars , ending 2017 it's bitcoin/blockchain.... wonder what the hot topic will be in the second half of the year
554 2018-01-01 17:03:39 @ZenBonobo @realDonaldTrump 401ks are stocks. They just don't want you investing yourself, cuz you wouldn't choose halliburton
555 2018-01-01 17:03:18 Here's my 2018 trading goals:
- FOCUS on best trading stocks
- Be patient on entries & exits
- Increase W/L ratio
- Increase profitability per trade
- Implement LT trading strategy
556 2018-01-01 17:02:45 Keep telling yourself that!  anyone with a retirement plan, 401k, or stocks will gladly go in and vote for him. They just won’t tell you about it, cause your not worth arguing about it with. Just like your neighbors, friends, and families did this last time

565 2018-01-01 16:57:57 Same to you, but I only have say 10% of my money in crypto. bulk in real estate and long term investments. And enough so I can day trade stocks and generate a monthly salary to live on.

572 2018-01-01 16:53:55 When a corporation buys it's stocks back it's making itself more wealthy. Less pieces of the pie means each piece is worth more and therefore driving up it's own value
573 2018-01-01 16:52:48 If there are #marijuana futures stocks I’d consider buying. But if the TV coverage is any indication, I think I need to invest in Mason Jars Inc.

581 2018-01-01 16:45:40 Caffè Nero no longer stocks banana syrup, and therefore no longer facilitates the drinking of the banana latte (the greatest coffee known to humankind). I am bereft. 
582 2018-01-01 16:45:07 I have been an educator for 30 years and a single mother through divorce.  People like me don't have money for stocks.  You don't care about people like me.
583 2018-01-01 16:44:42 @thinkorswim is a junk platform compared to Investools. I waste time creating thinkorswim tools instead of analyzing stocks.
584 2018-01-01 16:43:54 Is that the problem of 1% or 99%? No one is stopping anyone from investing in stocks?
585 2018-01-01 16:42:26 Stocks did pretty well under Obama, I think stock market performance would have been comparable to yours if Clinton had won
586 2018-01-01 16:41:50 The Snapshot was on december 28th. By now it's a matter of time until bittrex installs ardor and Ignis wallets. By then you should have your stocks back.

591 2018-01-01 16:36:12 Thank you for the treat. And thank you for the stocks, even though i still have less than a week here 
592 2018-01-01 16:36:10 2017 was a fantastic year for me! In 2018 I will work more on myself. Focus on one thing: Fear! Fear of missing a trade and fear of trading aggressive #stocks. I missed some great trades, especially in the last 3 months.
593 2018-01-01 16:35:55 tbh no... they had unforseen errors when compiling, this shit happens in software though and they've been working non stop to resolve. I mean look at Steve jobs iPhone demo that shit was faked with half working software and look at em now... people think this is stocks lol
594 2018-01-01 16:35:25 Which was the world's first electronic stockmarket ? Until this came up in 1971 , open outcry method was used to know the bid and ask prices of stocks.
595 2018-01-01 16:34:53 I tried to warn everyone,  stocks will crash!
596 2018-01-01 16:34:49 And so, with millions dying from tax cuts, repeal of net neutrality & WWIII,  the economy collapsing with stocks at an all time low, soaring unemployment, people of color and gays being sent to internment camps, sadly all the predictions for 2017 came true. All Trump's fault.

614 2018-01-01 16:27:01 Stocks had been rising steadily under Obama Tweet for brains.
615 2018-01-01 16:26:29 Isn't that what stock markets have become, a means of transferring wealth, contrary to intent of investing in stocks because you believe in the products/services of a company? Yeah, proven by various means like mutual funds where your investment direction is determined by another

624 2018-01-01 16:17:58 And what percentage of Americans do you think actually own stocks? Do you have any idea or are you just looking at a sample size that begins and ends with your family?
625 2018-01-01 16:16:54 Whose still putting hundreds of dollars into the Lottery & Casinos but not investing in Stocks & Cryptocurrency in 2018?
626 2018-01-01 16:15:10 Ok, how many people did it take and how long did you try? The wife and I are getting the shit kicked out of us.

629 2018-01-01 16:11:58 Okay, so I'm curious. What new year resolutions are you people making this year?

I'm going to try to learn how to trade using stocks and shares. I started about two years ago and just left it. I figured this would be more interesting than my normal resolutions! 
630 2018-01-01 16:11:03 Now that I’m done with college have more time for self improvement! Learning about stocks and investments is a priority this year . Also gaining multiple sources of income!
631 2018-01-01 16:10:15 Based on what? Stocks rose to record highs under Obama.
632 2018-01-01 16:09:29 everytime i switch stocks, i note it down as a long-short in a google sheet. illumines the value add.
633 2018-01-01 16:09:27 Once again: this trend started a decade ago under OBAMA. #2. It has ZERO to do with economic reality IRL because most Americans don't own stocks or have 401(k)/IRAs. That oligarch bubble you live in isn't populist. This is mostly a reflection of rich selling/buying. #fool
634 2018-01-01 16:08:39 You know, there’s a lot more to being a good president than just increasing our stocks (I doubt you’re the only reason they went up). Leave it to a crooked businessman to put money above everything else.
635 2018-01-01 16:06:48 Vas y tout les mardi ils refont les stocks
636 2018-01-01 16:06:40 You inherited a growing economy and stocks have been on an incline since Obama. But you go right ahead and claim responsibility. Very sad.
637 2018-01-01 16:06:24 All i’m saying is that in 2018 and beyond, aim to build a diversified portfolio that includes stocks (as well as #cash, #bonds, #property and #business interests) to support your long term investment goals. #longterminvesting #invest #save #mmwithnimi #risk #knowledge
638 2018-01-01 16:05:09 Are you like Seyi, still sitting on the sidelines too scared to invest because you were badly burnt 10 years ago? Now I’m not saying you should dive into the stock market just because of this news. There are no guarantees and stocks will go up and down. Volatility is real. #mmwn
639 2018-01-01 16:05:02 Sounds like a warning if you are into stocks :p
640 2018-01-01 16:03:09 I rule at timesplitters
641 2018-01-01 16:03:07 Holding Panasonic carbon, WPIL, Wendt India, Sandesh,  National Peroxide.. all are low volumes stocks. Love too such stocks.
642 2018-01-01 16:01:38 Happy new year with new stocks sir
643 2018-01-01 16:01:06 Do we still like #uranium and uranium stocks now that we are in 2018? 
644 2018-01-01 16:00:45 @FCC Can you pass a rule that any news anchor who talks about the actions of the stock market must reveal whether that invest in stocks.
645 2018-01-01 16:00:27 This is partisan bs.  Those people who were polled just said disapprove all the while enjoying an increase in their stocks and many lowered prices everywhere.
646 2018-01-01 15:59:53 Most middle class don’t have stocks! You are talking to the 1% as usual.
647 2018-01-01 15:59:40 Take the narrative this way - fall from 600 to 9 bucks .who made the bigger money ?
    Now if it rises from 10 as happening ? Who makes it big again - all the way in F&O 
 Shorting risk reward negligible at 9 bucks. we forget that they do play with stocks -
  Big b or small  B
648 2018-01-01 15:59:31 What Stocks?? You don't have any stocks. Well maybe with Castillo Rum
649 2018-01-01 15:58:55 Goals for 2018: 
1. Keep consistently going to the gym. Maintain Fitness
2. Graduate College with a 4.0 GPA
3. Buy and trade Bitcoin
4. Make smart investments. Earn 20k+ from buying and selling stocks
5. Land a job doing Software Development/Design (Robotics or Game development)
650 2018-01-01 15:58:36 On my way over to kick your ass
651 2018-01-01 15:58:09 I want to make more friends that invest in stocks 
652 2018-01-01 15:58:00 Paul, I sold all of my Stocks when you said the market would “never recover” under Trump on election night. Any new ecadvice for 2018?

654 2018-01-01 15:55:44 Economists forecast global growth to reach 3.8 percent in 2018, the same level as in 2017, with all major economies joining in. Despite the length of the recovery, global growth is set to expand. This forecast benefits investors going forward.

661 2018-01-01 15:48:55 Thanks for the reply. I'm new to penny stocks. Any suggestions on educational resources? Especially regarding weed stocks?
662 2018-01-01 15:48:49 J'ai besoin de toi comme d'une infirmière,
Que tu répares ma tête et mes sentiments qui fonctionnent plus bien,
Que tu refasses mes stocks de sérotonine,
Que tu me dises que c'est rien... 
663 2018-01-01 15:46:58 People no jobs are coming back. Use your head. Wages increase this past year? 2.4%. That's crap. Stocks have nothing to do with you. Dear God are you this desperate? You are seriously desperate. Beggars
664 2018-01-01 15:46:28 Wonderful stocks of wallpapers, right 
665 2018-01-01 15:46:28 Déjà ? 
C'était sans doute un stock de commandes annulées donc peu par rapport aux vrais stocks.
666 2018-01-01 15:45:53 @darshanvmehta1 why is there no circuit for adag stocks?
667 2018-01-01 15:45:52 Someone said I look like his grandpa pushing penny stocks on the table, who the fuck cares if you make money? Energy drink MONSTER was once a penny stock. And since my return, all the shit coins rocketed with my involvement

673 2018-01-01 15:41:33 Bump stocks?! You really are amazing.
674 2018-01-01 15:41:31 Stocks were up with President Obama. trump is a pathological liar and con man NOT TO mention SEXUAL predator
675 2018-01-01 15:41:22 After relentless buying over the last year just one day sell figure doesn't mean anything, enough liquidity in the system with retails investors willing to buy on dips so quality stocks will rise regardless of what market does, so don't make hype of small sell figure.
676 2018-01-01 15:38:51 Yeah. I forgot couple of stocks. Which are they?
677 2018-01-01 15:37:53 I’ve actually never used packs or stocks in my designs
678 2018-01-01 15:36:55 Hus- This year, will start investing in stocks
Wife- Which one will you buy?
Hus- That Bank
Wife- Why?
Hus- We can see their branch from our house.
Wife- Ghar se to mental hospital bhi dikh raha hai, ja ke admit ho jao.

683 2018-01-01 15:31:17 Our stocks did rally, all thru 44's administration. Sorry Don but your not the driver of that bus.
684 2018-01-01 15:30:21 On the stocks front, short positions were being created on the counters of #SBI & #HDFC Bank on Monday.
685 2018-01-01 15:30:09 I'm muting your twitter posts from showing up since it's mostly BS! What has the worthless Republican Congress done to act against bump stocks.  Still waiting because of your perpetual inaction. #DraintheRepublicans
686 2018-01-01 15:27:46 Laugh if you like but what I was seeing on the tape made my spidey sense go off - same thing happened Nov 16, 2016. I sold LEAF, CMED and others. I started writing my take profits note maybe 11:30am. Stocks dropped off a cliff an hour later. I bought back CMED $21.60's. Laugh.
687 2018-01-01 15:26:53 2 stocks that I'm interested in: IIL and Access Bank closed the year badly as investors were expecting a big payday; another year of no profit. They both should do better in 2018.
688 2018-01-01 15:26:34 Like I said new coach new season and they will be back to the laughing stocks see you on twitter complaining next year

694 2018-01-01 15:20:02 Financial stocks don't mean much to most of America, how many of your uneducated have a 401k? SERIOUSLY this country is going to end up in a recession worse than 2008 due to your deregulation&tax cuts to the rich on the backs of the working class! American Banks won't even lend2U
695 2018-01-01 15:19:53 hay packs de texturas y stocks, si buscas bien te puedes encontrar cosas bastante guays muchas hechas por usuarios además
696 2018-01-01 15:18:28 I will never understand the mindset of a liberal. What exactly is your complaint? W/Obama in office we lost jobs, freedoms and the country became very divided. Pres Trump has turned the tables and is bringing back jobs, religious freedom, stocks through the roof.

700 2018-01-01 15:15:43 ADAG stocks , jp associates, gvk infra makes massive moves...usually the bhangaar caps moving is a very easy signal to identify the top..in short term.
701 2018-01-01 15:14:09 Bump stocks used by Las Vegas shooter to massacre innocents-turning semi auto rifles into auto rifles are still legal-why?
702 2018-01-01 15:13:19 So out of touch thinking most Americans can afford to even have stocks.  Also the stock market is still doing well from former administration.   We’ll see what happens next year from the effects of GOP horrid tax scam
703 2018-01-01 15:12:45 No, living off all the upward trends Obama’s administration set...stocks, greater employment, jobs,health care. The unacknowledged legacy! Yes, they continue, but not better than Obama, tax cuts for corporations did give stock bump,but that’s not the economy.
704 2018-01-01 15:11:49 This is bizarre reasoning to me. Isn't trade with other countries why stocks are doing well? If stocks decline, why stop trading?
705 2018-01-01 15:11:19 !!! HAPPY NEW YEAR !!!

708 2018-01-01 15:10:09 We're not finished as a serious nation. We have enormous stocks of good people and a thousand things going for us. But we have to work at it with a bit more bloody gumption than we do at the moment, and the sooner we start the better. Happy 2018!

719 2018-01-01 15:01:23 Not if the new money given to the poor cases new stuff available to buy.  Poor people don't tend to buy already existing assets like land, stocks, etc...   They buy newly grown food, much of which gets tossed in trash cans because we produce more food than we sell

741 2018-01-01 14:35:07 Hi Marika, our sale will continue while stocks last.  We don't accept returns for sale price I'm afraid and would recommend contacting the store to make sure they will still accept the return before purchasing online.

744 2018-01-01 14:30:52 It's a common thing. I'm not one for selling losers particularly  (to me they are often a Winner in waiting) but I've learnt in recent years to let great Stocks run - TopChop rather than sell outright.
745 2018-01-01 14:30:01 I doubt very much stocks would be down by 50%, especially when you suggest she is in the pocket of corporate America and establishment politicians meaning nothing would change. Very different to a major recession by radically wrong policy.
746 2018-01-01 14:29:04 Yeah but you conveniently forget about Syracuse and Alabama’s schedule. Got it!
747 2018-01-01 14:29:04 FIIs net sold 67718 cr worth of stocks in last 5 months continuously from Aug-Dec. They hv actually net sold in last 8 months out of last 9 months till Dec. Now, chances are they may become net buyers from Jan and DIIs may become net sellers to them.
748 2018-01-01 14:27:44 Maybe stocks and bonds!

757 2018-01-01 14:20:45 Hey- if you're a working citizen and you've had any increases in your stocks/401K or the extra you get in your check from lowered taxes - mail those back to the WH so veterans & seniors can benefit from it all. And look to prev prez's for bolstering NK & Iran. Ignorance.
758 2018-01-01 14:20:32 Considering the #economy is way up, #stocks are up, #unemployment is down, ISIS is virtually gone, etc.....@realDonaldTrump has proven to be very #fit
759 2018-01-01 14:19:44 This means zero, nada & zilch to those who do not own stocks ... your base especially
760 2018-01-01 14:19:02 I don't get into stocks so couldn't really say either way. My friends over at @Captain_Gaspee follows it more closely.

762 2018-01-01 14:18:08 Market cap with crypto currency is different than stocks. It doesn't tie directly into a companies evaluation. This is a whole new space, buddy.

767 2018-01-01 14:14:58 What is the factual basis for this tweet? Stocks rose 29 % the first year of Obama’s presidency. Far larger than during your first year. Who is the fake news? Seems it is you! @realDonaldTrump
768 2018-01-01 14:13:39 Looking for the wolf of penny stocks

773 2018-01-01 14:10:37 I believe we assume future on basis on history in stock market and it always surprise investors with new parameter for analysis. Only long term investors with patiences can earn from stocks.#stocks

775 2018-01-01 14:09:51 So what more do people want...less taxes for everyone, no mandate for expensive high deductible health care, stocks rising...what is it liberals actually want
776 2018-01-01 14:05:50 All except for item 1, are the result of policies made prior to Trump’s presidency. Or did your stocks not go up during Obama’s presidency. I guess “ alternative facts” resonate with you more than truth. BTW, move to Indiana, then tell us how you feel.
777 2018-01-01 14:04:38 Who can afford to buy stocks? I'm just looking to keep a roof over my head as you make me poorer and poorer with your #GOPTaxScamBill You are Morally DEAD inside.
778 2018-01-01 14:03:29 I played a lot with the app called acorns a lot too. It would round your whatever you spent to the next dollar and invest it in whatever type of stocks you told it to
779 2018-01-01 14:00:36 Trump is a notorious cheater. Filming him would show just how bad he is and who he is playing with. Seeing his foursome would help in picking stocks.

785 2018-01-01 13:54:59 Correct. For liberals and Democrats, it will be “Armageddon”. For Americans, it will be fantastic! 2017 was incredible! Illegal border xings way down and stocks way up!

803 2018-01-01 13:39:08 S&P 500 momentum vs trend for 2018 is breaking, and January - October could be challenging. The Powell Fed will be pressured towards a slower rate hike cycle, which could help us to another stellar year for stocks.

808 2018-01-01 13:34:49 how to avoid bubble stocks&markets?

838 2018-01-01 12:53:47 Not "touting the rise" of stocks; just stating facts. Numbers don't lie. DOW broke all time record in 2013, & has reached all time highs every quarter since. Check your statements.

853 2018-01-01 12:32:10 My take on LTCG on stocks, if it is announced:

I support the move. It will be short term pain, but will rationalize taxes and motivate minority shareholders to keep sharper tabs on managements.

869 2018-01-01 12:15:44 This is the same I feel and probably underplayed as to why concentrated not always = risky. The more diversified I am eg above 15 stocks, the less I feel in control / finger on the pulse / researched and believe that I loose my edge and that adds risk to me.
870 2018-01-01 12:14:09 Are stocks are 100% premined, centrally controlled shitcoins? Ripple has a mission to increase the value of their $XRP and will do so.

878 2018-01-01 12:01:01 Market sources: the fall today was because of the fear of LTCG on stocks. The buzz is that govt may levy this tax to compensate for low GST collections.

So, if LTCG is getting discounted now, it is actually fantastic news. 

We're set for a rollercoaster ride, fasten seatbelts.
879 2018-01-01 11:56:34 Not if they make money buying picks. It's as legitimate as paying for someone else to invest your money in stocks.

889 2018-01-01 11:50:28 Thank you Eric and the very same to you. Don't write off the prop stocks - if interest rates reduce in SA they could do well again. Doubt we'll ever see +40% again but with good yields +15% is quite possible. I'm holding on to GRT.

909 2018-01-01 11:22:24 Obviously, a more objective comparison would be average annual returns. This is like comparing how much one guy earns in a year versus another over eight years.

Resolution #1: Buy stocks priced at 10x sales, 30-40x earnings, or better yet unprofitable. The market is efficient and high multiples signal that a stock is a compounder - it is impossible to lose money on these.

1417 2018-01-01 03:07:06 You’re so clueless and are certainly NOT patriotic or have no idea what that means. In fact it’s us that are the most law abiding citizen and believe in the rule of law.And your comment about bump stocks shows your lack of intelligence on the subject so maybe you should be silent
1418 2018-01-01 03:04:23 Things to achieve this 2018

1432 2018-01-01 02:51:47 The unemployment rate is 4.3%, a 16-year low. The Stocks have smashed records over and over, consumer spending is up, the housing market is booming, over 1 million jobs have been added, tax cuts have been made to help all people,shall I continue? Becaue I have plenty more.
1433 2018-01-01 02:51:31 Obama's first 11 months were stronger for stocks not because of Obama or Obama policies, but because Feb-March 2009 was the great recession bear market bottom of the stock market which was overdue for a huge bounce.
1434 2018-01-01 02:50:18 So glad your people can afford to own stocks- when most of us have medical insurance bills to pay
1435 2018-01-01 02:49:36 I could but I don't give investment advice, especially to crypto noobs. Don't want to have your rekt on my conscious. DYOR. Or just buy BTC, maybe some Eth and hodl. You wouldn't buy stocks from a faceless broker.
1436 2018-01-01 02:46:23 I must say if crooked Hillary was elected my stocks value would be least of my worries, taxes, fraud, more fraud, more taxes, deep state entrenchment..no Justice for America's legal voters. speaking of Justice still many that to need to answer for crimes @HillaryClinton

1438 2018-01-01 02:43:43 Stocks aren't American wealth. National debt is far more important. The American dollar is weakened further under your watch.
1439 2018-01-01 02:40:59 Always another hot sector that has some stocks that run up big around the corner. Just need to be patience and see the themes.

1444 2018-01-01 02:36:48 Yes they told us but after the previous incident I think there is still a huge doubt not mention all the people trying to hop on a moving train it will go up I figure crypto does everything opposite stocks do lol
1445 2018-01-01 02:35:53 The current gold base that you have drawn looks like a slightly stronger version of the longer 1986-96 bear market base.  Both the left and right side have eerily similar characteristics.  That base broke hard to new lows as USD & US stocks ripped.

1454 2018-01-01 02:28:59 Where do you get your news on growing stocks?
1455 2018-01-01 02:28:34 Let's see Billie boy economic sanctions well we red states have most of the oil and food stocks it's going to be hard if we impose boycotts by not shipping those products into ur environmentally concerned states what's good 4 the goose is good 4 the gander
1456 2018-01-01 02:28:29 And absolutely NO PROGRESS on background checks or bump-stocks . . .
1457 2018-01-01 02:27:33 Short term dump, no doubt. But when MJ stocks fly in January, so will the weed coins. 
1458 2018-01-01 02:25:14 .  Please don't let it be another crooked trick from our incorporated government.  I have worked for corporations my whole life I know for a fact how they manipulate the stock market.  Now they will give themselves bonus checks and report losses and all the stocks will drop.
1459 2018-01-01 02:24:52 Who cares if Bitcoin's dominance on CoinMarketCap is falling when the main competitor isn't even a cryptocurrency? What's next? Will CoinMarketCap list Apple and Amazon stocks as well? @TechBalt

1468 2018-01-01 02:17:07 Si ça peut te consoler : les stocks sont au plus bas en France, 20% de la production habituelle seulement en raison de la sécheresse catastrophique en Ardèche.
1469 2018-01-01 02:15:54 Nothing surprising. Stocks had a very good year and bonds not so much. Later retirement yr funds have more stocks in the mix.
1470 2018-01-01 02:14:12 I am playing mmj stocks how I played it since 2013. I played it perfectly. Not saying 2018 will be the same case. But I am going on what I know . January February will be the worst two months in the sector. Time will tell. Right or Wrong I am playing it my way . All the best
1471 2018-01-01 02:08:56 Oh, except the average American who has to work and live paycheck to paycheck do not have any stocks! You are so out of touch and so very UNPRESIDENTIAL! #Unpresidential # #Resign

1475 2018-01-01 02:05:03 WSB's top stocks of 2018? #shitpost
1476 2018-01-01 02:04:14 Yeah, real scam.  I'm going to save $3K this year. And I'm far from being the "rich elite" and I'm not a "Trump golf buddy".  When you consider the gains in my various IRAs, 401Ks, and other stocks and bonds, the tax cut is going to be a real boon for my wife and I.
1477 2018-01-01 02:04:09 I wonder if he realizes that many people, like me, have no stocks?
1478 2018-01-01 02:02:41 1/2 Clock is ticking on #Wraith but please keep in mind people, the crypto world can be very based on speculation...  I’ve been in stocks for over 15 years and with crypto, there aren’t earnings calls talking about guidance for the next quarter...
1479 2018-01-01 02:02:10 My cryptocurrency portfolio rose 2.16 times in the last 3 months, stocks are a waste of time.
1480 2018-01-01 01:59:09 Don’t you already own currency by banks now? And stocks? So what’s the difference?? Why not own both?
1481 2018-01-01 01:57:47 Feel free to donate your record earnings from stocks thanks to YOUR president Trump!
1482 2018-01-01 01:57:39 Great wealth...only for those wealthy enough to own stocks on the index. FOOLISH
1483 2018-01-01 01:55:07 Obama was dragnet for the last 3 years. Stocks skyrocketed when trump got elected
1484 2018-01-01 01:53:51 What stocks?
1485 2018-01-01 01:52:53 This is why it is the best and quickest way to become a millionaire Today. I regularly make 20% profits in 4 hours or less. I trade stocks too, but never made profit that fast.
1486 2018-01-01 01:52:13 Could you be a bigger liar?  Again, average working class Americans, DONT OWN STOCKS, but we would like a raise.  Our company just got a massive tax cut, so where is our raise??????????
1487 2018-01-01 01:51:36 Give me a break. Stocks job etc are real.
1488 2018-01-01 01:51:06 In 2018 we doin stocks. Someone ask me what I do and I can just be like “I’m actually in bonds” 
1489 2018-01-01 01:50:34 THE HALLYSTIC SYSTEM OF TREASURIES,BONDS,STOCKS,PRECIOUS METTALS,ENERGY RESOURCES,GLOBAL CURRENCIES & TELEMETRY EMISSIONS GET PRESCRIBED BY JOHN STAMPOULIDIS` EQUATIONS THAT USE THE ALGORYTHMIC EQUATIONS OF THE CROSSIAL & X INTEGRALS,RAISING HUGE PROFITABILITIES-REVENUES GLOBALY.
1490 2018-01-01 01:49:39 Stocks were up more in Obama's first year. Just sayin'...
1491 2018-01-01 01:48:25 The biggest mistake people make is to go into bonds. A zero sum game. Better offf to keep 3 years of cash ( less dividends) and the rest in Stocks.
Why do investment advisors recommend 60/40 is absolutely beyond me
1492 2018-01-01 01:47:41 Your foolish if you believe that. Stocks are up as they were the first year of Obama’s presidency. Keep believing the Russian puppet if you must. You’ll see it in the end.
1493 2018-01-01 01:45:16 His base believes he “gave up” his presidential salary. Probably using it to invest money into stocks his buddies utilized insider trading 2 alert him about. There’s no way anyone whose last name is trump paid for those trees. Don’t stop playing golf all the time-just plant trees
1494 2018-01-01 01:43:01 Are you implying the half that owns stocks are the same half that voted for Trump? Didn't happen.

1498 2018-01-01 01:40:43 Funny..  If Hillary was President our Stocks may have been down 50%, but our values would be up 100%
1499 2018-01-01 01:40:37 to be honest, that's all due to Obama's policies. since that "tax plan" of yours was signed, stocks have plummeted.
1500 2018-01-01 01:38:59 Wow. Doesn't he understand that the vast majority of people don't have stocks and shares? That the share bubble is going to burst soon anyway. Will the price crash be because of him, then?
1501 2018-01-01 01:37:51 Me at work: *stocks grapes*
Coworker: *comes and starts fixing display* huh what idiot put these grapes out??
Me: o.O I dunno, must’ve been one of the new guys...
1502 2018-01-01 01:37:50 Stocks rose at a higher percentage under Obama’s first year than yours.... have fun when you are no longer enjoying the tailwinds of President Obama’s economy. When this is over your brand will be shot. Hope you can build hotels in Alabama and West Virginia!
1503 2018-01-01 01:36:43 What are stocks.    ???????
1504 2018-01-01 01:34:11 Mm, I do like bonds. And stocks!
1505 2018-01-01 01:33:54 Yes we can, limit the size of clips, eliminate bump stocks, and get to the root of the problem which in most cases is mental illness. Plenty to do but NO ADMINISTRATION HAS ENGAGED, NONE ZIP, NADA. Different discussion altogether, guns don't kill people people do.
1506 2018-01-01 01:33:49 If you believe bump stocks were the issue in Vegas, you are such a sheep.  That whole thing was staged and Paddock was a Patsy. He was dead before any shots were fired. He didn’t kill anyone, but the guys in 3 helicopters did. #DeepState.
1507 2018-01-01 01:33:48 You know your year's gonna start bad when Bayonetta 2-stocks you on For Glory
1508 2018-01-01 01:32:55 You have yet to offer any ideas that would have kept the Las Vegas shooter from doing what he did.  Bump stocks.  Really, did you forget about silencers and chain saw add-ons?  You must be a Hillary follower.

1514 2018-01-01 01:27:43 Stocks were up at a much higher percentage at the end of Obama's first year than they are in 2017. 
I know that you are unaware of this, or are just too stupid to know this, but look it up.
1515 2018-01-01 01:27:23 If there ever was a crock of crap-this is it-You think talking Stock Market to the 302,000,000 (7%) Americans that own little to no stock can convince them to not vote Dems in. You’re talking to the 1% that owns 53% of all stocks & the other 9% that own 40% of the remaining stock
1516 2018-01-01 01:27:06 @FXS_Stocks_DE We are exactly 8,843km apart. Come visit?
1517 2018-01-01 01:26:31 Stocks are up because Trump is pro-American and he has momentum behind him

1523 2018-01-01 01:20:03 Are you ever going to understand that he isn’t the US President? He’s a 3rd rate TV show extra, acting as president of a confederation of dunces. Soon they’ll  wake up and help put him in the stocks.
1524 2018-01-01 01:19:01 And we ALL know stocks went up starting with Obama..... don't we?
1525 2018-01-01 01:17:17 Funny how we only talk about the stock market when republicans are in the WH...and the unemployment numbers become “real” again..

1529 2018-01-01 01:14:34 Why is job growth slowing?   Less jobs than last yr.  Sad. You only got an 18% increase in stocks.   "O" did 36% his first yr.    Disappointing.    Least bills signed by ANY recent president.     Sad. Most days vacation in history. Disappointing.

1544 2018-01-01 00:51:00 My stocks have gone up the last 6 years or more, so I am calling BS!
1545 2018-01-01 00:50:51 Nobody believes this bullshit stocks are through the roof and were safer than ever
1546 2018-01-01 00:50:40 If you woulda told me 6 months ago by the end of 2017 I’d have 3 different IRAs, money In stocks, crypto currencies, and make more money in 2 months than I’ve made my whole life, there’s no way I’d believe you. I could buy a fucking house. These last couple months saved 2017.
1547 2018-01-01 00:50:08 CNBC 8/2/17
CNBC recently cited one measurement showing stocks are 72% overvalued. And David Stockman, former advisor to Ronald Reagan, believes stocks will crash 30% to 40% this year. WRONG AGAIN NBC!
1548 2018-01-01 00:48:48 Like... I was a Boeing employee. Was given stocks and would have bought more but we employees were constantly reminded that we could go to jail for insider trading so I said... Screw investing in my company that threatens me with prison for purchasing!
1549 2018-01-01 00:48:39 stocks went down last week who do you think you are fooling idiot
1550 2018-01-01 00:48:37 My Disney stocks are pleased.
1551 2018-01-01 00:45:30 I sold for some other stocks. I own a bunch of stocks outside of crypto.
1552 2018-01-01 00:44:11 He’s talking about wu ver. There’s always somebody higher than us in terms of some or the other thing. Sure the world is harsh but remember there are people trade stocks ;)
1553 2018-01-01 00:43:54 Armada’s strategy that match was get the lead

Run away from Ganon, get a turnip.

Rinse and repeat for 3 stocks.

He used a 2/3 move strategy that Ganon couldn’t figure out how to deal with.

So he cheesed him.
1554 2018-01-01 00:43:53 Oh stocks, money vested. He got no problem putting men n women in harms way. Just don’t want to pay for it when they are Veterans 
1555 2018-01-01 00:43:34 @TD_Canada I was really hoping to buy more $WEED stocks on Friday when it plummeted but I couldn't log on after dozens and of attempts. Any compensation from you guys for the missed revenue I could have gotten? I really don't want to leave TD because this is unacceptable.
1556 2018-01-01 00:40:03 The price of every thing rises and falls from time to time and place to place. #forex #stocks
1557 2018-01-01 00:39:30 haha bear market = prices of stocks falling. bull market = rising.
1558 2018-01-01 00:38:54 Most of us lost any stocks we had in 2008 thanks to GOP! 
1559 2018-01-01 00:38:41 I can't wait for the Trump economic crash to come. That stupid tax bill will undoubtedly help. Heavy on cash right now and ready to scoop another house plus stocks on the cheap. I'll probably buy that house in a red state from a desperate seller for max enjoyment.

1561 2018-01-01 00:38:09 The "Composite Index", as the S&P 500 was first called when it introduced its first stock index in 1923, began tracking a small number of stocks. Three years later in 1926, the Composite Index expanded to 90 stocks and then in 1957 it expanded to its current 500.
1562 2018-01-01 00:37:33 Uh...MOST of us don't OWN stock in ANYTHING. Most of can't even explain stocks. Except of course for your supporters. They have stock in YOU and we ALL know how that's gonna turn out.

1565 2018-01-01 00:33:32 Two ex-Googlers hope to replace your bike shop with a plastic cube that only stocks one product per day.

1568 2018-01-01 00:32:06 Soon listed / French new old stocks / Vintage 1970 knitwear
1569 2018-01-01 00:31:26 When Trump refers to the value of “your stocks” going up he is not talking to the majority of Americans, none of whom can afford to own stocks.
1570 2018-01-01 00:30:27 Di ako kumuha ng stocks kasi alam ko aalis ako kaagad hahah
1571 2018-01-01 00:30:23 I hate everyone who even remembers that
1572 2018-01-01 00:30:08 If Hillary got elected stocks in jails would go up because you and all your cronies would be getting federal housing in them.
1573 2018-01-01 00:29:06 Stocks that benefit the top 10%.
1574 2018-01-01 00:28:38 I’m not rich, I have no stocks, you suck the dicks of corporations.  We know and We will end you.
1575 2018-01-01 00:26:50 No one except few is really interested in your welfare. Keep this in mind when you discuss either your problems or stocks you own.
1576 2018-01-01 00:26:11 Really. Is there any evidence he could successfully pick stocks without insider info?
1577 2018-01-01 00:25:43 kasi naman e. dapat iniimpose na ang total ban sa mga paputok next new year para wala ng nasasaktan ng dahil sa paputok. stricter regulation isn't enough. kasalanan din ito ng mga dilawang disente daw pero kung makabili ng paputok sa bocaue e halos ubusin daw lahat ng stocks!
1578 2018-01-01 00:25:41 Stocks were rising higher under Obama than under you 45...with your logic then, continuing with a Democratic administration our stocks would be rising even higher
1579 2018-01-01 00:24:29 Have seen a few lock stocks @GraysonThe sorry no points
1580 2018-01-01 00:23:54 Us regular taxpayers don't have "stocks" so do you really think THAT matters to us at a time when you are taking away from the lower income people to reward your rich "loyal" money hungry swamp?
1581 2018-01-01 00:23:29 Most people don't have stocks you silly fool.
1582 2018-01-01 00:23:14 The stocks of Sauvignon Blanc are going to get depleted. Watch out!
1583 2018-01-01 00:21:49 @Amber_Stocks I got 1 name Coach... Gabby Williams 
1584 2018-01-01 00:20:26 Happy new year, I hope your career only gets better. Keep moving forward
1585 2018-01-01 00:20:19 That's good.
1586 2018-01-01 00:19:25 Lots of people say the market is an indicator, and just as many say it isn’t. When I talk of significant market improvement, I’m judging from my own stocks and seeing the %increase. It’s been a very good year for the index. I can’t deny the obvious.
1587 2018-01-01 00:19:17 They have a great future on the backs of consumers due to deregulation and a reduction in consumer protections. Big business will skyrocket in profits while we have to cash out those stocks (for those who can afford to invest) to pay our losses.
1588 2018-01-01 00:18:36 Jonathan is comb to chem trails stocks ?
1589 2018-01-01 00:18:02 No companies are hiring more people. They're buying more of their own stocks and laying people off. Trump and republicans just fucked everybody to please their donors.
1590 2018-01-01 00:17:12 BE HAVING DREAMS THAT IM A GANGSTA. DRINKING MOETS HOLDING TECS. MAKING SURE THE CASH CAME CORRECT, THEN I STEPPED. INVESTMENTS IN STOCKS, SEWING UP THE BLOCKS TO SELL ROCKS, WINNINGS  GUNFIGHTS WITH MEGA COPS. BUT JUST A NIGGA WALKING WITH HIS FINGER ON THE TRIGGER
1591 2018-01-01 00:16:12 That's your idea & that's fine. I won't impose my will on you, don't you impose your will on me. Any weapon is an assault weapon & let's face it, they can be made at home so don't be surprised if any type of ban doesn't work. They banned full auto but then they got bump stocks.
1592 2018-01-01 00:15:40 My stocks were stagnant for YEARS! In 12 months, I have made THOUSANDS. GDP is up for the first time in forever. Pull your head out of Obamas ass and wake up to the reality of the situation. You probably think Hillary won, too... #MAGA #2020 #suckitlibs
1593 2018-01-01 00:15:03 ok ok.. i know.. i'll prob lose it all but man.. playing in the cryptomarkets the last month has been pretty fun. i do stocks too so seeing over 20% gains is amazing compared to stock worlds. also.. go #XVG!
1594 2018-01-01 00:14:42 Obama saved this country from going into a depression and when he left MORE JOBS were created Auto saved and stocks went from 7000-19000. Better than Trumpy. Btw He’s lost jobs last month. Does anyone check on truth? Ugh!!!
1595 2018-01-01 00:14:29 So, your stock portfolio is doing well? It’s been a 7-year bull run, of which DT has been president for one year. If you actually had stocks, you would know that.
1596 2018-01-01 00:13:53 #PSA When all you can Say (Lead with) to Sum UP YOUR 1st year as President is Stocks are HIGH & then attempt to Bash @HillaryClinton ... You KNOW we have a Problem! @cnn @MSNBC @maddow @hardball @NBCNews @JoyAnnReid @chrislhayes @realDonaldTrump Dave, is your HAT #Bedazzled? Awwh

1598 2018-01-01 00:09:59 Stocks are mostly owned by the rich. He's only tweeting to his rich buddies.
1599 2018-01-01 00:07:00 IMNP will go down in history as one of the worst stocks in 2017. Congrats to Management for doing such a fine job.
1600 2018-01-01 00:06:41 No with interest rates at 0, fixed income buyer looking for income had only one option: stocks. Money had to go somewhere for a return.
1601 2018-01-01 00:06:26 Poor people don't have stocks you dufus. Will someone impeach this fool??? #MuellerTime
1602 2018-01-01 00:06:05 I just saw Up Time Energy at a 7/11 in Maryland. They heard that Up Energy is hitting 7/11 stocks soon so they figured they should try make a profit. Little do they know Up Energy is about to take over @Guzmanfitness @ShawleyCoker @MaxxChewning @Alphalete
1603 2018-01-01 00:05:28 Oh. Ok. So it go. Leave it this time still. Gwaan do oonu ting. When Manley did a jook wid Cuban and Basic school maybe advantage coulda did take...just suggesting.  But since you know stocks/loans different from recurring expense me no really believe you...But pass
1604 2018-01-01 00:05:04 Who cares most middle class don't buy stocks..
1605 2018-01-01 00:03:09 Wish I had some stocks to brag about!
1606 2018-01-01 00:03:08 Two bottles of vodka at all times has pretty much been the 2017 bare minimum acceptable stocks, right? Here’s to a better year ahead (though with no less alcohol, just there for better reasons!)
1607 2018-01-01 00:03:01 My stocks er doing great before you were elected. They made a great comeback from the 2008 crisis.
1608 2018-01-01 00:01:21 Yeah, but racism wouldn’t be rampant, sexual abuse would still be frowned upon, and the American people would still have their dignity!
But yeah, rich people’s stocks are up, so there’s that I guess.
1609 2018-01-01 00:00:54 Got to love it  you guys trying to keep the doubt alive so you can buy the Dips.  IMO no question this is legal 2018. Stocks like $N.c $ISOL and $LG.v wouldn’t only benefit in a big way if naysayers were correct
1610 2018-01-01 00:00:18 1) NPR just did a story where they talk about how the economy is improving throughout the segment.
Then end saying that 50% of the population owns stocks but the other guy admits "yes but many of those people own drops in the bucket and the only people benefiting
1611 2018-01-01 00:00:02 The market does not know if you are long or short and could not care less. #forex #stocks
