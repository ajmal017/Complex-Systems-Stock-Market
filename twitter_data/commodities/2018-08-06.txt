52 2018-08-06 21:23:47 Under capitalism, demand is defined as the amount of money the market is willing to pay for a particular amount of commodities. Under communism demand is merely the rate of commodity consumption and use, and supply is the rate of commodity production.

83 2018-08-06 18:22:42 Na verdade, a ideia seria evitar a valorização excessiva em momentos de alta de preços das commodities, ou seja, reduzir a volatilidade cambial (apreciação excessiva seguida de desvalorizações abruptas)

89 2018-08-06 17:57:09 Unfettered capitalism turns all-- incl the natural world which sustains life and human beings--into commodities to be exploited until exhaustion and collapse. Capitalism can exist under a variety of systems (see China). The problem is treating "free markets" like a law of nature.
90 2018-08-06 17:52:49 Disagree. In CPG many products are commodities with little product feature differences (protein bars), the branding & packaging & messaging is what makes a product stands out on the shelf. Paid marketing is still important for digital acquisition but branding is fundamental.

96 2018-08-06 17:25:48 Lmaooo. Why not? 

Government policies can regulate competition in market so that the consumers are paying equilibrium price at least for goods/commodities.

97 2018-08-06 17:23:57 Exactly two of those G5’s would be “surprise” teams. The others are all known commodities.

99 2018-08-06 17:11:17 For commodities, I don't think the northeast is equipped to scale up — there's just not the ag land. I mean, even King Arthur Flour sources from Kansas! So you're right, there are different questions at play, regionally.
100 2018-08-06 17:08:40 Sometimes vegetarians are the hardest to convince to go vegan. They are so stubborn and really think that what they’re doing is enough, jesus. They still think animals are commodities, they’re obviously on the wrong side
101 2018-08-06 17:05:37 Been saying it since the start. It's the vehicle they'll use to strip out every law, statute, protection and right that stops them putting us under the heel of another jackboot and turning us into nothing more than disposable commodities. Cogs in corporate profit machine
102 2018-08-06 17:01:57 I can see #BVB is looking at Witsel as an end result (here and now). As for a resale, it all depends on how well he settles in and produces for Dortmund. I don't think all fans see players as commodities. It all has to do what the players do on the pitch.
103 2018-08-06 17:00:31 Neoliberalism is, by far, the WORSE thing ever happened to humankind since at least the industrial revolution.

It has destroyed everything it has touched, everywhere. Even our societies to the point that human lives are commodities.

And the planet. It fucked the entire planet.

112 2018-08-06 16:17:25 Not true. Middle class wages have been stagnant for 30+ yrs. Housing is up & products are up. Housing is not stopping in this state and if low wages go up so will commodities. Those low wage job weren't meant to be living jobs.

118 2018-08-06 15:58:04 Is that why there has still been nearly zero wage growth in the last 18 months? And commodities markets are the most unstable they've been in decades? Not that any of that really matters for you, you might be done before the year is. #Impeachment #Now

125 2018-08-06 15:17:10 Not to be “that guy,” but shouldn’t it be “werehouse,” and not “warehouse?” The prefix “were” in “werewolf” comes from the Latin “vir,” which means “man.” “Wares” are goods, such as commodities, and I don’t think that they can necessarily move around on their own. #GeekOut
126 2018-08-06 15:13:11 also sold <> only product sold there. used to be like that. that tells you all you need to know. population going up and needing these common household goods that are unfortunately (as of now) commodities = brutal price war despite rise in demand

143 2018-08-06 14:19:24 As China is still a global producer, a cheap yuan is not what Washington has demanded. The metals-driven spike in commodities in recent days suggests China has an EM play afoot. Agro-alimentaire commodities look lacklustre, but oil price is down. Yuan contracts?
144 2018-08-06 14:18:08 You have no idea what you are talking about idiot. Go check the drought maps that NOAA produces and come back with your no climate change argument. Water is one of the most precious commodities in a farming state like California. No diversion happening.

184 2018-08-06 10:02:03 So true. Trans is a purely neoliberal capitalist ideology, which seeks to make human bodies and identities into commodities and products to buy and sell. It's a perversion of old sci fi transhumanist idea, and it worryingly fixates on children. It's a dangerous mess.

193 2018-08-06 09:32:46 The way banking is done, commodities are traded, and currencies are made and traded are the biggest areas that need reformed in the global economy and nationally. I came to that conclusion before I knew about any conspiracy theories. I think it's just simply greed, no grand plan.
194 2018-08-06 09:32:28 Because commodities are made from nature and capitalism needs to make more commodities every year to keep growing. International proletarian dictatorship is the *only* solution.
195 2018-08-06 09:27:10 The only way to save the world is really is revolution, international proletarian dictatorship and central planning. Capitalism needs to keep growing, needs to make and sell more commodities every year, and since commodities are made from nature...
196 2018-08-06 09:18:08 5. In this instance, the result could be the opposite of what you claim. As redirected export product is diverted to the domestic market, we could see a glut in certain foods, and price crashes.

207 2018-08-06 07:48:39 As for the interest rate, since there’s higher satisfaction, the demand for borrowing money and financing goes up to get items, so the interest rate goes up in response to the increased demand for commodities which require financing due to their high price.

238 2018-08-06 03:14:11 Eu nao concordo. Mas, como disse respeito. Vc nao está trabalhando com um produto cujo preço é previsivel, é commodities. Nao há previsibilidade de preco, ora Iron ore tá 40 ora tá 70 ora tá 120. Seu custo era 50, vc cortou custos e foi 45. Excelente. Mas e se cair 35?
239 2018-08-06 03:13:15 ~ 2/3 of this nation's economic might is concentrated in the coastal blue states.
The commodities produced in the flyover states are just that--commodities.
You can source them anywhere.  Brazil, for example.
Not so for the innovations coming out of Silicon Valley.
240 2018-08-06 02:21:25 i had the grimmest reading of Marx's theory of value on shrooms, commodities embody death (labour = life spent).  surrounded by glimpses of the abyss.  was trying to study on a microdose.  microdose my ass had to quit that shit and lie down

242 2018-08-06 01:42:22 I expect Kemba to go out there and ball like he does day in and day out making himself one of the hottest commodities next summer... I expect at least an eight seed #Hornets #BuzzCity

244 2018-08-06 01:17:20 Building on what Alison said, all the commodities affected, how, where, and what's their farm and health needs, that we can assist with.

Additionally, how are the Southern state farmers preparing for drought conditions and unreliable spring/summer rains, for crops and livestock?
245 2018-08-06 01:15:33 Trump's tariffs will speed up the process. Farmland will be bought up by corporations that will be bought up BR foreign corporations (China) and commodities exported.

El Precio de los Commodities, por las nubes, durante el Kernerismo NO SE DESAPROVECHÓ.
SE LO ROBARON. que no es lo mismo.
247 2018-08-06 01:01:32 This is big for me. I try hard to make sure my photos and weekly MiLB rundown highlights the humanity, and never treats these human players as commodities. It matters!
248 2018-08-06 00:59:32 A time of Wallstreet excess, focus on making money, living the good life culturally - somewhat reflected in the film. The Me Generation was during this time period. Alex P Keaton from Family Ties. Interesting they chose Philadelphia and commodities rather than Wallstreet.

251 2018-08-06 00:36:53 But what is surprising was he still got a very good satisfaction rating with +58. Can’t imagine how this happened when many are complaining about rising prices of basic commodities, injustices, corruption, and criminality among other issues.
252 2018-08-06 00:34:57 We looked you up with 36 hours of people into commodities is partly why we should wantME:

254 2018-08-06 00:30:35 This scenario satisfies the bond - stocks - commodities rotation.   Bonds topped in July of 2016.  The stock market likely topped at the beginning of this year.  Commodities should have one last blast to the upside.  Dr #copper  looking bullish on the weekly.
255 2018-08-06 00:28:40 Thanks for sharing, to add insult to our industry, there is a strong push to try to mandate these types of "wellness" & "prevention" commodities covered by HI as "health care"
256 2018-08-06 00:10:22 By Two God awful places—no place Absolute as commodities, is illustrated in copying; he was turned into a sullen mystery
257 2018-08-06 00:09:40 Also why I personally believe a lot of these traders w/ no traditional market experience are not prepared for this. They read a bunch of TA books, & don’t understand that charting is only a fraction of predicting price action on legitimized & regulated securities/commodities/etc
258 2018-08-06 00:09:22 @NoMansSky Seany boy what happened to trade commodities. Literally made it so economy scanner is useless pretty much
259 2018-08-06 00:04:53 Drugs are illegal. You can't use capitalism as your argument. Commodities used in capitalism are taxed. Drugs in this case are in the black market.
260 2018-08-06 00:00:20 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
