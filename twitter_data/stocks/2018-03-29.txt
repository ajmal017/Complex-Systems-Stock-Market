5 2018-03-29 23:57:21 I'm to busy feeling sorry for my stocks portfolio to share spread that feeling
6 2018-03-29 23:57:11 Me thinks you're a tad too bearish.  $GOOGL is in THE digital sweet spot for the next at least 10 years. I bought more on Tues.  $GOOGL should make $50ish this year, $60ish  next year. Of all the stocks to short, $GOOGL??

91 2018-03-29 23:56:37 They should put him in medieval stocks for opening his filthy scottish mouth! How dare he upset a few people with a joke... Such an irresponsible act!
92 2018-03-29 23:55:04 Bump stocks do not make weapons automatic, they speed up the fire cycle rate but still require the trigger to be depressed for every shot. They use the recoil of the gun to make a person not have to move their finger to operate the trigger. That said, they are bad for the gun.
93 2018-03-29 23:54:53 Jeeez I don’t know. I got a dime. My kids got a quarter. Of course that was 30+ years ago. I can’t even imagine nowadays.  A cell phone? Hundred bucks?  Didn’t crazy Farrah #teenmom buy her kid stocks in something or other?
94 2018-03-29 23:54:08 Laura Ingrham isn’t standing in the way, she didn’t do or say anything about military weapons It’s Congress & NO ONE ELSE. Congress writes a bill to ban assaults weapons & bump-stocks, then CONGRESS VOTES, IF IT GETS PASSED N BOTH HOUSES, EVEN IF TRUMP VETO, CONGRESS CAN MAKE LAW
95 2018-03-29 23:54:06 Keep an eye on US GPU stock AMD, which is recently suffering from FUD due to Bitmain Ethereum ASIC. Possible double whammy from falling stocks and cryptos. 4 hour chart worth a look
96 2018-03-29 23:53:15 The companies that pulled there ads, well thier stocks fell today!  When will they learn?
97 2018-03-29 23:52:02 Mrs. Delaney Tarr did in fact use that cliche during her speech on stage during the March for our Lives.  And she made it explicitly clear during her speech that the “inch” is bump stocks and the “mile” is an assault weapon ban (like the one that was in effect from 1994 to 2004).
98 2018-03-29 23:50:32 And many Americans do support a ban on assault weapons, ban on high multiple shot bullet clips, better background checks and ban on bump stocks.
99 2018-03-29 23:48:47 Trump didn’t cause Amazon’s stock price decline. All tech stocks got hit hard over the past week....
100 2018-03-29 23:48:45 And?
101 2018-03-29 23:48:34 Trash don’t do it, invest in stocks instead. Apple, Netflix, Google, invest in companies you know that will be around for 5-10 years. The bank is gonna take that money you gave them and use it to invest on their own.
102 2018-03-29 23:48:25 By rabbinical decree...matzah stocks nor matzah may not rise
103 2018-03-29 23:48:24 Lol...you know nothing..However, since you assumed...Ft. Jackson basic 88/Ft. Gordon AIT 88. 72E then transitioned to ROTC and was S2/S3 29th SIB. Seen people get shot. Had soldier play Johnny Uwith a frag grenade and drop it. Watched his fingers go bye-bye. Don't pee yourself.
104 2018-03-29 23:47:41 That moment when associate's tell you about the stocks and properties they own but then whine about being in poor.
105 2018-03-29 23:46:33 broke: banning bump stocks to stop gun deaths
woke: banning bump stocks because it's stupid looking and dumb
106 2018-03-29 23:46:15 You should invest in @bluebuffalo I think their stocks will rise after nutrish bails.

181 2018-03-29 23:41:32 #Stocks end holiday shortened week, the month and Q1 with a rally #Dow closes up 255 to 24,103, #NASDAQ up 114 to 7063, #SP500 up 36 to 2641 A look back and a look ahead this weekend on @KNX1070 #MottekOnMoney Guests include Hugh Johnson, @MktwHulbert @PhilAngelides
182 2018-03-29 23:41:28 Then there's the other side let's just take ALL guns, repeal the 2nd. 
Who is affected by common sense laws:
Anyone under 21
Limited access to mentally ill
Anyone who wants bump stocks
And military type weapons. None of that infringes on 2nd
183 2018-03-29 23:41:18 I am! This guy is smart, leveraged on the sept 11 incident Lool Stocks went VOOOM!!!

187 2018-03-29 23:40:42 While we’re at it, what is your course of action?  Let me guess,  no more bump stocks.
188 2018-03-29 23:40:18 Tanking Amazon's stocks is probably the best thing Trump has ever done in his whole life

191 2018-03-29 23:38:54 @NestleUSA I am disappointed that you dropped out of advertising in the Ingram show. I hold stocks which I will be selling. You should stay out of a teenagers tantrums when the truth was spoken about him. Sorry for your choice
192 2018-03-29 23:38:31 I started putting money in stocks. I have no idea what I’m doing, but I’m figuring it out as I go!
193 2018-03-29 23:36:24 I need to start trading stocks.
194 2018-03-29 23:35:32 If you answer no to the first question then your new laws will most definitely affect your rights. The bump stocks situation is dumb. Who determines who is mentally ill and can they ever be removed from the no buy list? The background checks are being addressed now.
195 2018-03-29 23:35:14 Ummm not true. Bump stocks made legal by obama. Trump has put in to ban them.
196 2018-03-29 23:35:10 Stocks\Mutual Funds that payout dividends.
197 2018-03-29 23:34:18 As a young cat who doesn’t own any stocks yet, I find this whole situation pretty funny.
198 2018-03-29 23:33:59 I'm not sure you can get much more nonsensical than "Stocks I'm Never Selling" articles. Unless you're in your 70's (or older), you're either dishonest or not very bright.
199 2018-03-29 23:33:53 I like big Stocks.,$ZN... To get more bang for your buck on ZN check out the         { Call Options } .
200 2018-03-29 23:33:14 Twitter was a neutral platform. As a neutral platform they are free from lawsuits. Once they start curating content, they are now publishers. Lawsuits are going to come down hard on social media soon. Stocks will retrace.

202 2018-03-29 23:32:26 I mean their stocks will drop and then the prices will  but not for long 
203 2018-03-29 23:32:08 It is market manipulation. He drives a company’s stocks rapidly down, then vultures buy cheap befor it recovers. See Trimp and: lockheed-Martin, Toyota, Boeing

207 2018-03-29 23:30:03 Check the value of their stocks over the next few days.   People are going to lose money over this nonsense.
208 2018-03-29 23:29:53 Many factors can explain that : access to the markets, low liquidity compared to stocks, no closing days  ...
If you look at the overall Market cap (which you need to take for what it's worth), this is a drop into the financial "industry".
Everything move faster.
209 2018-03-29 23:29:48 That is such a lie!  What is wrong with this jerk!  All 90% of the people in this country want are simple fixes. Why is that so hard to understand?  Keep you guns just ban Ar-15, bump stocks, have a waiting period, background checks, and raise the age limit by 3 yrs!
210 2018-03-29 23:29:26 Now that is a HUGE mistake!  But thanks for informing us. I know where NOT to SPEND my money now!  WILL SOON SEE YOUR STOCKS PLUMMET!
211 2018-03-29 23:29:24 No he didn't. He loosened restrictions on those with mental health problems buying guns. As for the bump stocks I fully support that and I hope he goes on to do more.
212 2018-03-29 23:28:09 Who is dictating these ideas to you? Who's behind the scenes, shorting the stocks? Hmm?
213 2018-03-29 23:23:46 Bragging again! Stocks down! Employment down! Farmers going broke! Military paying for his wall! Stormy weather all around!

276 2018-03-29 23:22:39 I'm ready for a new party but don't forget Trump has not shown fiscal conservatism + banned bump stocks to appease the left. He shouldn't have signed omnibus, especially without the wall, and is now pushing for infrastructure spending. All these MFers wasting $ we don't have.
277 2018-03-29 23:22:31 Summary of main items-national universal:
background checks & wait period-no exceptions
No assault weapons or bump stocks
No clips over “x” (I say 6, others say a few more)
Insurance, periodic safety training
No guns for partner abusers
Owner trigger recognition
No open carry,
278 2018-03-29 23:21:30 Not banned if you can pass a background check and can afford it. Retarded going after bump stocks. Pollock/vegas had enough money to own aircraft and no priors. He could have legally bought heavy mgs and caused MORE damage.  Or he could have crashed an aircraft into the crowd.

280 2018-03-29 23:21:14 3. NRA says NO to
     *NICS
     *closing loopholes because they         'don't exist'
      * banning bump stocks
      *No Gun Zones except transportation hubs & GOVERMENT BUILDINGS? (What makes them so special?)

283 2018-03-29 23:20:18 Right. But I'm showing which names have led the pullback. Because that's where people are focused now: pick up the hardest-hit stocks, or stay away, expecting more pain to come?
284 2018-03-29 23:19:30 Same. The bump stocks thing. Vocational Schools vs. Community Colleges. Space X being inactive. It’s an uninformed alternate fictional dilution.
285 2018-03-29 23:18:39 Got to get me one of them there bumper stocks!
286 2018-03-29 23:18:38 You don't need a crystal ball to determine the flow of the mkt. I use breadth analysis of stocks making new highs and new lows to key me in, though I use it in a way that works for me and my method.
287 2018-03-29 23:18:34 Because you know that at least 1 life will be saved, if that's the case why don't we limit how fast your car can go, in olympia they have safe places for you to shoot heroin for gods sakes.bump stocks banned, extended background checks, i'm all for it,that's enough,nuts will kill

291 2018-03-29 23:13:40 @cnn @npr @msnbc @abc @cbs @nbc  How many corrupt Trump family members and friends own Amazon, steel, aluminum and defense stocks?? How many bought and sold on Trump actions? Do your job and investigate.
292 2018-03-29 23:13:15 Those MUs only get cited by Twitch monsters for viewership reasons.  They are really average length MUs in the grand scheme of things.  They feel longer when they are so common, but totally reasonable to play.  Some MUs feel like a slog with 5 stocks for the player.
293 2018-03-29 23:13:12 It stocks gotta ride it down , bout to check Binance
294 2018-03-29 23:12:50 That was the takeaway from a large pool of traders that sent the stock down a $1 AH. 99% of the time your incredible logic calms crazy waters, but to add a negative tone on one of the best stocks in the tech/chip sector is just unnecessary. You know this stock is heavy oversold.

296 2018-03-29 23:11:49 Illinois already banned bump stocks.... and fully automatic weapons are banned as well...
297 2018-03-29 23:11:29 Talk about lying through their teeth.  They claimed they were going after bump stocks and other modifications that would make a semiautomatic into an automatic. Clearly that was just a distraction.
298 2018-03-29 23:11:15 Wow... love how Amazon stocks went up despite trumps tweet 
299 2018-03-29 23:11:13 Who cares! Never heard of your company before. Go ahead and remove your ads. You'll just see your stocks removed and will go bankrupt for listening to a stupid little punk that is taking advantage of dead kids who were killed at a school shooting. #BoycottNutrish #BanDavidHogg
300 2018-03-29 23:09:57 @cnn Exactly, the same thing with tariffs. Why is this not be investigated? Attack and threaten = stocks drop, corrupt buddies buy. Do a 180, stocks rise, sell. Notice most of the tariffs were quietly given exceptions? It is all corruption.
301 2018-03-29 23:08:55 @Nutrish wow,  what cowards you are.  You just showed the world ur more concerned about politics than YOUR JOB,  feeding animals!  Hope to see your stocks tank
302 2018-03-29 23:07:55 Let's start with how many bullets a banana clip has and winnow it down from there.

And you're wrong about the existing laws.  Private seller andbgun show loopholes are real. Bump stocks remain legal. Domestic abusers still have their guns.
303 2018-03-29 23:06:31 Stocks to watch when market reopens on Tue.  AMC - wait for break.  AUB has broken strongly and you should look for pullback to around $13.50.  ELD broken as has GPT.  Look for target on GPT around $4.96. Watch SHL - overdue for a break.

305 2018-03-29 23:04:45 Oberweighting of soft stocks causes confusion.
Moody tech stocks that sell emotions
do not provide stability when the knife is falling.
306 2018-03-29 23:04:29 I know most of this stuff started because Trump had that little pow-wow with all the Democrats asking what they think we need to change and then the NRA bitching about bump stocks that Obama not once but twice looked at and said we're okay!
307 2018-03-29 23:04:24 Stocks are down ??  Best showing in 15 years !!
308 2018-03-29 23:03:51 Scott already says his earnings have been adversely impacted by 30-40% by a pi$$ed public on 'suspicion' of Trump's abhorent dealings.  Imagine how they'll feel about Scotty's shilling when Trump's treason is proven. Stocks & tomatoes maybe

316 2018-03-29 22:59:38 No. We. Don't.

Hand guns, yes.  Rifles, no. Fix that, same rules across the board for all fire arms: age restrictions, licenses required, permits required, universal background checks, no bump stocks, then we can see eye to eye.
317 2018-03-29 22:59:38 2*auto are already illegal.  Semi auto means you can shoot w.o. cocking each time you pull the trigger.  Assault rifle is a tossed around, non- descriptive, "triggering" term. (no pun int.!)   As a conservative, I'd support  1) armed guards in schools, 2) outlaw bump stocks, and,
318 2018-03-29 22:57:51 @SebGorka , Netflix stocks fell greatly today
319 2018-03-29 22:57:31 She shouldn't have apologized....There are OTHER ADVERTISERS. These companies showing political bias have made piss poor decisions. They've angered more than half the country. Their stocks are going to plummet after their political stunt.
320 2018-03-29 22:57:16 Don't let domestic abusers have guns. Don't let private sellers skip background checks. Don't let teenagers have rapid fire weapons. Smaller clips. No bump stocks. Unify gun laws so people can't just drive to a jurisdiction with weaker laws.
321 2018-03-29 22:56:28 @Alaska_Tea   Not good. Hope things dont escalate. With stocks and cryptos going down, debt approaching unserviceable levels we might be moving towards a global reset ie world war. Hope not.
322 2018-03-29 22:56:23 You’re right on that part. Its casual for crypto to go through these boom and bust cycles relative to stocks moving 10-20%. But I’ll  be damned if you say you’re not enticed just a bit by the meteoric 4000% rise.
323 2018-03-29 22:54:35 I’m rich bitch and all y’all going to collage lackin got half of what you gonna make in yuh life doin that(invest in stocks) yo dumb ass kids
324 2018-03-29 22:54:05 "Despite the fact that the Obama administration approved the sale of bump fire stocks on at least two occasions, the NRA is calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law."
325 2018-03-29 22:53:34 6. Bump stocks are almost never used, and make the bullet cluster more inaccurate
7. You have to get a license to own any gun, you have to get a Firearms owner Identification Card, and then a Conceal and Carry Weapons Identification card in most states
326 2018-03-29 22:53:31 So are they just going to come take my bump stocks or take any gun they ban that I have no they can't
327 2018-03-29 22:51:28 There stocks fell today. So did Netflix!  Lol
328 2018-03-29 22:51:05 WASHINGTON – President Trump signed a memorandum instructing the attorney general to regulate the use of bump stocks, effectively banning the use of the devices that can allow rifles to mimic automatic weapons.
He's not Congress - he doesn't make laws. Blame them for not passing

404 2018-03-29 22:44:36 I wonder if @elonmusk pulling out from FB just tied him to the FB scandal in the eyes of the investment algorithms, and if that's partly why Tesla stocks are dropping.
405 2018-03-29 22:44:08 Final glycerol stocks made, meaning I don't have a single prokaryote or eukaryote requiring any form of attention while I'm on holiday 
406 2018-03-29 22:43:58 Someone once said only good stocks have bashers.  If that's the case, we own the best damn stock in the world!  Bought and locked more down today.  Next week let's rocket!  $IFXY

408 2018-03-29 22:41:46 @zombiekiller My advice don't chase penny stocks and know your maximum acceptable loss before going into a trade and stick to it like a glue
409 2018-03-29 22:41:40 Actually, it can. You would be surprised how easily people get spooked when it comes to stocks
410 2018-03-29 22:40:35 Ask other companies how pulling their ads worked for them. Their stocks went down big time.
411 2018-03-29 22:40:28 لا اتوقع 
412 2018-03-29 22:40:25 Liberal boycotts always fail. Conservative boycotts are extremely effective. Look at the NRA memberships skyrocketing. Look at the companies that went against the NRA stocks all plummeting.
413 2018-03-29 22:40:10 What are your thoughts on stocks direct listing on NYSE? What should we anticipate moving forward? Will more companies try this? #MadMoney @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC
414 2018-03-29 22:40:00 Soooooo happy I sold my stocks lol 
That took a huge dump
415 2018-03-29 22:39:50 $TSLA :  Biggest recall in company's history just announced. 
Scary to see all the issues with Model S, Model X and Model 3 
I guess I should stay clear till the dust settles which means not even get tempted to buy stocks or #Tesla car at any prices until .... Only God knows lol
416 2018-03-29 22:39:49 I'm just bitter because I don't have stocks, bonds, or dividends, or anything else thats taxable.
417 2018-03-29 22:37:17 And I and my family will no longer purchase your products. Caving to political pressure will only drive your stocks down as both sides boycott your product for stepping into the political fray.

419 2018-03-29 22:35:28 Sure. Pikachu’s uair is one of the most effective tools against air camping in the game, gimps, has heavy combos on floaties off stray aeiral, is combo food himself, finishes off stocks easily vs. high % foes, lacks a projectile. Easily character w/ 2nd fastest MUs after Falcon.
420 2018-03-29 22:35:11 I think it's a step in the right direction, however kids can still get their hands on guns that their parents own. I think we need to focus on magazine and bump stocks! #epgilheanys18 #susocialwork
421 2018-03-29 22:34:55 Maybe you can explain why my company too money from tax cuts to buy back stocks, then fire over 600 people just to replace them with cheap foreign labor. I thought the tax cuts was supposed to benefit is working class people. Your president is full of shit as are his followers.
422 2018-03-29 22:34:23 I think JIT buffer stocks are usually only two hours. A full customs search could easily take that. Even if there isn't a queue.
423 2018-03-29 22:34:09 Watch their stocks. #BoycottNutrish
424 2018-03-29 22:33:32 Gutsy move. We need more of those. Somehow, my grandparents, parents, aunts & uncles, friends & neighbors, and I have managed to hunt, target/skeet shoot, and defend our homes without AR15s, armor-piercing ammo, bump-stocks, or large-capacity magazines.
425 2018-03-29 22:33:28 @realDonaldTrump Stocks finish quarter strong, but Dow snaps longest win streak in 20 years. Way to go "Mr. Tariffs are easy". 20 years.
426 2018-03-29 22:33:24 Oh, you bet he is...deliberately. He found out when he 1st got in that his words matter to the stock markets. He is affecting the free markets with his words to deliberately tank their stocks; this is NOT his place and business affected should sue HIM! #Republicans @POTUS
427 2018-03-29 22:33:16 I'm a reformed sneakerhead. Had to let that life go. Now I use that money to buy stocks instead. Much better return on value.
428 2018-03-29 22:32:39 These companies will find out soon. Watch the market. Their stocks fell today
429 2018-03-29 22:31:53 That’s where my second point comes in. Repealing the 2A is virtually impossible, procedurally speaking.

They can’t even get congress to ban bump stocks. There’s not a chance in hell they’d get super majorities to repeal 2A, let alone ratification by 3/4 of the states.
430 2018-03-29 22:31:13 I know it sounds harsh. But Paddock could have done.a.lot more damage with controlled fire. 

And as you said if he already had them, would a law prevent him from acting. He was already ready to break numerous laws when he opened fire. Bump stocks ban wouldn't have changed that
431 2018-03-29 22:31:03 #BTSarmy literally discussion buying BH stocks if/when they go public and how it could benefit their investmemt portfolio.

435 2018-03-29 22:27:15 So you say. Millions are not enjoying tax breaks. Millionaires enjoying tax breaks. They said someone making 60 or 70 thousand would have a 7 dollar a month increase. But it is costing a trillion dollars. And companies gave a one time bonus, are using the money to buy back stocks

437 2018-03-29 22:26:44 In the UK - Minority Groups are being handed more rights than the rest of UK citizens!

438 2018-03-29 22:26:01 Mason jars buried on the back 40 aren’t stocks or investments. Nor are the points they accumulate on their piggly wiggly shoppers card. @eurigmorgan is correct.
439 2018-03-29 22:25:08 So shouldn't the 555 million Soybean predicted ending stocks be automatically changed to 475 million when the new acres are used?

442 2018-03-29 22:23:24 David, when will u answer my non combative questions?  What is in the new gun bill, what r bump stocks and how do they effect gun purchases, what are the leading causes of deaths with teenagers and the most important, what is the cause of these shootings?
443 2018-03-29 22:22:49 In many ways Trump reminds me of Alan Greenspan.  Whenever Greenspan said anything the stock market would react.  Same with Trump, he called out Amazon and boom stocks drop.

Seriously who was the third person in our conversation I need to @ them because it was so obvious
450 2018-03-29 22:20:57 $SPY Just a friendly reminder that many stocks will rise with the market, however not all will continue higher. Be selective on stocks guys.
451 2018-03-29 22:20:07 i'm picturing stocks below a big 'Spirit of Cricket' sign of some kind.
452 2018-03-29 22:20:02 Banning bump stocks & similar device ls would be a good step, but since you can bump fire w/o a special device,banning high-cap mags (IMO only mags under 10rnds should be legal) would be more effective.
453 2018-03-29 22:19:51 HHRR being traded like in the stocks market. Kind of weird, is it?

525 2018-03-29 22:13:29 I believe investor like Warren buffet buys stocks for long term and manipulate making profit using future and option. It's a win win situation for them both ways. When you have lots of money it gets easier to make money in this scam.

541 2018-03-29 22:07:15 We already control who gets them so fine we’re done talking about gun control then right? Why do you guys want to ban AR’s and bump stocks then?
542 2018-03-29 22:07:05 You're extremely patient, @Mogens_Schou. What do you say, @CoastalPO, any guess what the avg discard rate is for your gill net members? Lower than the expected uplift? Or at least for the stocks subject to the LO thus far?
543 2018-03-29 22:06:02 One of the things I remember from the Dotcom crash is that stocks can decline 3-7% per week for a very long time.

546 2018-03-29 22:03:44 And? That's all you need to roll over and surrender your rights to government in exchange for government approved privileges? You're weaker than a starving Ethiopian child.
547 2018-03-29 22:03:35 1) it's pointless to ban bump stocks due to their simplicity. It's literally just a spring in a stock. 
2) an AR-15 is weaker than most hunting rifles.
548 2018-03-29 22:03:03 Good! Now about those bump stocks...
549 2018-03-29 22:02:50 Not the government's job to provide healthcare. And take a look who ran Detroit and Flint...Democrats. If they can't manage cities, why the hell would I trust them with healthcare?
550 2018-03-29 22:02:02 Of course you would.
551 2018-03-29 22:01:51 That's unfair. Many of us Democrats have long advocated for sensible gun control measures: a ban on bump stocks, on assault-style riffles, on large capacity magazines, and thorough/complete background checks. To characterize that as "controlling" people is paranoia.

Ban bump stocks. They should have been illegal already. It was an Obama era BATF that brought that disaster.

556 2018-03-29 21:58:03 Do I fully understand everything about guns? No. It’s not my forte. But there’s no need for bump stocks. An average person with no training shouldn’t be handed a serious gun with serious power either.

572 2018-03-29 21:48:08 Fake news.
Bump stocks by definition do not make rifles full auto and were not under regulation to be banned.

589 2018-03-29 21:34:58 I agree.  It’s a massive failure of government to allow weapons and accessories like AR-15s, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks to be purchased by citizens, especially deranged people Nikolas Cruz.Don’t worry we’re working on changing that. #neveragain

599 2018-03-29 21:33:19 Mr. President please explain how do you intended to pay for all the bump stocks that you want to ban. These stocks were bought legally & in good faith. Now you are talking about banning them. This amounts to taking someone property with out due compensation which is Constitution.
600 2018-03-29 21:30:30 And they weren’t machine guns! They were semi-auto rifles, and as of yet, no one has verified if he actually used the bump stocks!  Still more questions than answers!
601 2018-03-29 21:30:20 I can't give buy/sell advice to you, but ask yourself if you think we will see the increase in HRS acreage forecast by USDA today. If so, that grows stocks unless weather threatens this summer.
602 2018-03-29 21:30:14 Financial Advisers used to make fun of the Tech sector, how they could just throw darts at the dart board with a list of Tech stocks and were guaranteed a winner, same with coins today until it isn’t. The big boys will survive but the little ones will make you rich today.
603 2018-03-29 21:29:55 No. ‘Machine guns’ are very clearly defined as firearms that use gas or recoil to reset the weapons receivers and continues firing another round without the release and reengagment of the trigger system.
That’s why Bump Stocks are legal.

612 2018-03-29 21:27:03 Paddock (Las Vegas shooter) fired around 1,100 rounds in 10 minutes, thats 100 using multiple guns all capable of firing (with bump stocks) at 7-9 rounds per second. Say 20 - 30 seconds for 100 rounds

624 2018-03-29 21:24:04 Great! 
Let's just be glad this was announced after-market. 

We really didn't need the market being reminded of data security concerns (and tech stocks taking yet another whipping).
625 2018-03-29 21:23:55 I disagree. They still make millions from insider trading on stocks. That's how they come into office with a million and leave with 30 million plus. Kerry, Gore, Pelosi were among the worst.

628 2018-03-29 21:22:32 Sovereigns ran out of things to buy and started purchasing stocks. Also ETFs became a big thing.
629 2018-03-29 21:22:19 This is basically true for every company like Amazon. Convenient and extremely profitable - but that profit's stolen from the workers and given to the suits who sit around all day trading stocks
630 2018-03-29 21:21:21 3.  Later in the year energy driven inflation will become an issue for the Fed, bond markets and consumer driven areas of the stock market.  Nasdaq MAY have topped. Higher energy is a headwind for stocks like AMZN (shipping costs).

After a + b #stocks will be a lot cheaper.

677 2018-03-29 20:59:11 Why did stocks up? Canned (sarcastic) answer: Stocks have been volatile, and while the macro-backdrop has been tricky because of rates, today saw more buyers than sellers because stock prices were at a level that supports long-term cherry picking of quality names."

689 2018-03-29 20:52:31 Great post! NRA represents a small minority. Gun owner & CC in NY. I support background checks, no gun show/private sales, waiting periods, ban high capacity mags and bump stocks, permits for handguns, 5 round max rifle mag, mandatory training. Never seen a 223 AR in the field.

691 2018-03-29 20:51:39 @Richzeoli Using Congressman Massey's logic that making bump stocks illegal can turn unknowing people into felons means we can't outlaw anything that was at one time legal. Cocaine used to be legal. Controlled substance as of 1914. My great grandma had a jarful.

695 2018-03-29 20:49:16 Probably machine guns should be illegal to get. And absolutely bump stocks. You don't want a semi automatic rifle turned into an automatic weapon.  Totally agree with you. I would like schools to be safer though. I know u disagree. Metal detectors. Or system they have in Indiana
696 2018-03-29 20:48:43 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $BAC, $MU, $FB, and $CSCO.

698 2018-03-29 20:47:45 Classic projection, Seany. No one is suggesting taking away your precious guns, but there is no place outside the military for semi-automatic weapons, bump stocks, high-capacity clips, kevlar bullets, etc. You can plug animals and protect your home w/out military weapons.
699 2018-03-29 20:47:24 The top five stocks that gained today were $CNC, $MRO, $PCH, $TSCO, and $INTC.
700 2018-03-29 20:47:23 Our 2nd amendment took a serious hit under Trump. taking guns from people under 21..seriously wrong..removing Bumpstocks...seriously wrong labeling guns with bump stocks Machine Guns. REALLY?  They are taking guns from folks on Medical Marijuana? WE took a hard hit.
701 2018-03-29 20:47:21 No keep it just get rid of anything that would allow it to be fired like a machine gun (like trump did with bump stocks or said hes going to do who knows with him) like i said those are all just examples its a starting point im not against most guns, if its for show who cares

Haven't used Amazon since I found out they were selling bump stocks
709 2018-03-29 20:42:06 Generally, that term applies to hoarders of money. Similarly, 'investors' gets misapplied to those who merely trade in stocks and wouldn't recognise an investment opportunity if it slapped them in the face.

745 2018-03-29 20:25:19 I live off my stocks and I’m doing great.  Curious ~ Do you even have a 401k?  A job?  A degree?  Own a business?
746 2018-03-29 20:25:07 yes they are all going out to buy their bump stocks before they are illegal. That's totally great for the rest of us who could never defend ourselves against a killer with a bump stock.
747 2018-03-29 20:24:39 Personally I want the enforcement of our current laws, such as background checks, stricter guns laws (and enforcement) at gun shows, a ban on semi-automatic guns for civilians, and a ban of Bump Stocks.
748 2018-03-29 20:24:39 99.995% of the US thinks that AR means Assault Rifle but it really means Armalite Rifle when they changed from Wooden stocks to plastic/composite to lessen the weight of the gun.
749 2018-03-29 20:23:59 Stop the nonsense, troll. Stop trying to blame this on Obama. This is about the refusal of the @NRA and the @GOP to follow thru with common sense steps such as banning assault rifles & bump stocks, closing gun show loophole, and implementing universal background checks.
750 2018-03-29 20:23:32 Of course a person can still do damage with a fucking lower-capacity magazine, but if it means a mass-shooter who stocks up at a gun store is only able to kill six people in his rampage instead of 19 people, then the law has had a good impact.
751 2018-03-29 20:22:22 FYI, you can replicate bump stocks with a simple belt. That kind of does nothing. Unless passing these bills is just about optics (I suspect it is), people should really consult those who know about them..clearly they didn't.
752 2018-03-29 20:22:22 Trump is trying to ban bump stocks. That’s more then Obama did. You could trigger mod just about any gun by the way. This is why I know banning the AR15 won’t fix anything. Extremely small % of shootings are from rifles.
753 2018-03-29 20:21:57 Are you saying bump stocks were illegal at the time of the shooting?  Sorry, gotta call you out on this one.

756 2018-03-29 20:21:33 A9 I think as older kids yes, but initially it is all about learning the fundamentals of the value of money. Probably more important to teach about savings schemes and how compound interest works before stocks.

758 2018-03-29 20:20:44 Great in principle but fear it would be major burden on employers. I saw first hand how clunky just one payroll and one AE system was. Until it's all automated and seamless I would be fearful of high cost for marginal perceived benefit.
759 2018-03-29 20:20:27 For me it would be to stop day trading venture or CSE stocks. I tend to day trade bigger stocks decently.

If you ask me, 3% GDP is pushing it.

767 2018-03-29 20:17:38 Potentially. But on the other hand, the plantings are more forward looking (18/19) while the Mar 1 stocks are not as much so (17/18). Esp. for corn, given the mega demand as of late, I don't think it is hard to overlook Mar 1 stocks for now. Soybeans? Eh, maybe a little harder.

776 2018-03-29 20:13:53 Just another victim of leftist ideology.. I will miss the awesomeness of Cadbury eggs.. but f it.. they sealed their own fate.. see ya!! *stocks WILL plummet**
777 2018-03-29 20:12:54 nowhere near me stocks it, not even waitrose :(
778 2018-03-29 20:12:47 Have you been in a coma this entire time?  Wall being built, lower taxes, unemployment down, stocks higher than a kite... No DACA!
779 2018-03-29 20:12:44 World stocks higher: US +1.4%; Europe +.4%. A snapback rally from oversold markets gave investors relief, at least today. More telling will be Monday. Still likely for positive 2018 returns, but political risk could dominate good earnings. If trade war (unlikely) all bets off.
780 2018-03-29 20:12:40 @trish_regan and @FoxBusiness While the #StockMarket was open, the .@POTUS was speaking about #infrastructureinamerica which moves #stocks when you broke in. You might want to think about that next time. @realDonaldTrump @OANN @TeamCavuto
781 2018-03-29 20:12:23 I build very good lies and make them the bigglest. I got rid of bump stocks is one of them and a wall paid for by Mexico what else, I,m the best president ever bigger than George Washington who knew?
782 2018-03-29 20:12:23 Dow industrials rose about 250 points as technology stocks gained, but the index posted its first quarterly loss since 2015  -- The Wall Street Journal
783 2018-03-29 20:12:21 Getting a little tired of you causing volatility in the market because of your tweets. Also you haven't said similar about Walmart highlighting the many main street businesses they destroy.  Funny you pick and choose.  Your family & friends shorting stocks and making $$$?
784 2018-03-29 20:12:20 Sometimes it’s just too impossible not to notice how obvious the market is rigged some times. Great bounce today, but not enough. More downside ahead. #Stocks
785 2018-03-29 20:12:07 A fixed deposit system gets you quicker dividends than stocks, just use a good old generation bank. Better still, go for Mutual Funds with an Insurance company. My 2 cents 
786 2018-03-29 20:11:48 So you are saying a corporate CEO deserves 20-30 million a year? Plus stocks and offshore accounts?
787 2018-03-29 20:11:47 Stop buying. Into this crap remove your adds you will end up hummm check your stocks I really have t chuckle that’s all it takes grow a pair
788 2018-03-29 20:11:46 Hey just realize... stocks and other markets are in bearish mode for couple years. So being in crypto, it’ll be accelerated quicker. 
789 2018-03-29 20:11:45 So far this rally has the feel of a dead cat bonce where stocks attempt a low volume rally to the nearest level of resistance.  Majority of leaders currently have broken charts.  Time will be needed to repair those charts before they can setup for further upside.  Remain Patient!
790 2018-03-29 20:11:30 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, SEC dept has not been doing the job they supposed to do 4 decade. They ignore complaints & info. fm whistle blowers. Citron is a licensed investment firm & it's illegal 4 them to pump stocks & short selling stocks while trading them @ the same time
791 2018-03-29 20:09:51 No sorry !!! Stocks are down by billions due to this unconscious ruptures !!! You’re just killing your economy !

793 2018-03-29 20:09:00 The problem with a bear market now is that it begins with the #FTSE index at the level it was at 18 years ago. Even if stocks are up since 2009, we haven’t had a proper bull market.

What about the alternatives?
794 2018-03-29 20:08:03 Stocks resume climb. The Dow closed at 24,157.71, up 309.29 (+1.30%). Nasdaq +1.64%. S&P +1.40%.
795 2018-03-29 20:07:50 I don’t support David Hogg, but I support the 2nd Amendment, stronger back ground checks, the raise from 18 to 21, the ban on bump stocks, and the other Parkland Shooting Survivors.

But not David Hogg. 

Sorry but that’s just my opinion and if you’re offended, just block me.

799 2018-03-29 20:06:59 I have never seen an assault rifle advertised for sale.  Is black plastic used for murder, and wooden stocks to shoot deer ?
800 2018-03-29 20:06:43 Agreed 100%,. Do they really want boycotts of their products based on political views.  U will really start to see stocks plummet then.
801 2018-03-29 20:06:42 Last log I got in was from Alty’s at Hesketh Bank. @melcourtltd can probably tell you who else stocks it locally.
802 2018-03-29 20:05:44 Gah! So much nondisjunction. Labs with mites, beware. You will never know the benefits of these stocks. Because you will lose them.
803 2018-03-29 20:05:16 Good to see that Small stocks still dont respect the bounce in the correlating ETFs but get dragged lower on any small pullback.  Further downside for them to come $SPY $IWM $XBI

807 2018-03-29 20:01:05 Yes, we should ban bump stocks.  They are just a way to sneak around the law banning automatic firearms.

809 2018-03-29 20:00:23 Happy @RobinhoodApp is starting to implement cryptocurrency but I wish I could control placement in the app so it wasn't above stocks. Watchlist should always be below what you are actually working with.
810 2018-03-29 20:00:13 Economy is on fire. Wall Street hasn't planned well and stocks rose to quickly. Two different things. Our jobless claims this month were the lowest since 1973. So, you're wrong. Still. #MAGA dummy.
811 2018-03-29 19:59:51 Whilst blood stocks are low, the absolute minimum interval is 12 weeks providing you are fit & well and have the permission of the nurse at the session to do so. However, to do this is an exception and future donations would be advised to be at 16 week intervals or more. 

Thanks
812 2018-03-29 19:59:05 The single most outrageous thing Trump does is manipulate the price of individual stocks in order to control individuals. He doesn’t like what WaPo publishes so he’s attacking Amazon. Long since time to impeach
813 2018-03-29 19:58:53 They are assets, stocks and commodities. 
The unknown youth always has insulation. When a commodity becomes known their value drops. 
CJA would be a prime example of this. Guy keeps producing yet isnt worth anything. Alfred Morris was this guy as well.
814 2018-03-29 19:58:33 Why would obama take our Guns? He's the one who approved "Bump Stocks" for sale.

820 2018-03-29 19:56:51 Shortfall in acreage outweighed bearish record stock numbers, which came @ 2.1 bln bu for SBS & 8.89 bln bu for corn as of Mar 01. The stocks were 185 mln bu higher vs expected for corn &77 mln bu for SBS. Wheat stocks were largely in line @ 1.494 bln bu-@AgriCensus

822 2018-03-29 19:56:10 @wisebread @NatlJumpStart A9 How many parents actively trade stocks versus have an advisor or some other tool to decide how to manage their investments?

825 2018-03-29 19:54:39 You do realize he already banned bump stocks and strengthened the background checks? Oh that is right you only watch fake news. They never tell what is really going on.

829 2018-03-29 19:53:48 Yes, the states and local govts can restrict some types of weapons and ammo.  My first post was pointing out that the AR 15 currently sold is not a military weapon. On top of it.  Banning bump stocks looks on its way to being law soon.

833 2018-03-29 19:52:59 Any chance you'd make a video of you trading large blue chip stocks? I know it wouldn't bring in the views like low float trades where you bank 30k in a min. do,  but would be interesting to see!

850 2018-03-29 19:46:00 Stocks closing in nicely today. 
851 2018-03-29 19:45:52 Their default position of "too soon" has so been busted by the Parkland survivors, their families & friends.  They don't have data to support their claims so they try and change the narrative.  

They claim Obama wants your guns, and then falsely claim he supported bump stocks.
852 2018-03-29 19:45:10 Get rid of their stocks. Stop using their service. It's the only way to fight back. We are literally financing our own demise.
853 2018-03-29 19:44:43 For all the people that stopped using snap, there's more people getting hired at a different up and coming social media platform, just like the old saying for stocks" When ever you sell a share there's someone on the other side buying it"
854 2018-03-29 19:44:41 Wonder what stocks will have bad news or a not so desirable filing after the market closes, it always happens...

859 2018-03-29 19:42:19 If you have been too scared to be invested for one of the longest bulls ever, you probably wouldn't pull the trigger if U.S. stocks get clobbered.
860 2018-03-29 19:42:19 You got a lot of pro crony capitalism fans not happy to see Amazon pay fair taxes. Employment is low, economy is strong and companies are buying their stocks back. God forbid someone pay taxes other than me.
861 2018-03-29 19:42:03 From less to more: Stocks go up in the long run have a positive return, poker has a great component of skills where better players beat weaker ones, for last marriage, you get in with no comparable practice and 50% divorce rate
862 2018-03-29 19:41:47 The #KochBrothers-led charge to take out #Tesla is reaching a crescendo, with even Teslarati and others blaming Musk for the $TSLA stock drop.

863 2018-03-29 19:41:06 Seems like I remember something about "if they give an inch, we will take a mile". Oh wait, that was with guns and bump stocks. I am sure this response is totally random and unrelated to that...
864 2018-03-29 19:40:05 Need a new host.  Wapner talks and talks and talks but doesn't say much of value. He gets confused as who is the expert. I am not sure if he has a license to recommend stocks as he did today.

868 2018-03-29 19:38:50 Second, yes should allagree on bump stocks. But some people are still opposed to that  for reasons I don’t understand.

That was quick!

870 2018-03-29 19:38:17 if you are concerned about holding stocks over the long weekend it may be a good time to sell .   Wall Street and the GOP have propped the market today
871 2018-03-29 19:37:29 If it seems like stocks always go up, that's because they've been doing so for a really long time - almost a decade. It seems the longer the good times roll on, the more overconfident investors and entrepreneurs become, and the less wise their investments tend to become.
872 2018-03-29 19:37:04 Bump stocks: technically do not turn semi-auto into automatic. Practically, however, they achieve the same effect. Therefore,  either the automatic weapons ban needs to go, or bump stocks do. Either an automatic rate of fire is unusual and dangerous, or it isn't.
873 2018-03-29 19:36:17 For what?  Bump stocks?
874 2018-03-29 19:35:40 I came. I blocked. It's gone! 
I'm thinking I should invest in eye bleach stocks. Guess it's not that unusual for you ladies.
875 2018-03-29 19:35:38 I believe sensible gun control like: banning AR 15, and bump stocks, expand background checks, and raising the age limit to buy a weapon will help ALL students everywhere.
876 2018-03-29 19:35:02 Yeah, I checked the regs. The parts to modify semi-auto's are also illegal. The bump stock was a work around because its not a single trigger pull. Nevertheless, the regulatory route will take years and will be challenged. In the meantime, a million more bump stocks will be sold.
877 2018-03-29 19:34:46 Not actively trading stocks now, but I just bought a share of Tesla stock as a vote of support for the great work by @elonmusk and his teams @Tesla and @SpaceX.  My small way of saying thanks for making engineering exciting again.
878 2018-03-29 19:33:58 The majority wants the second amendment to stand but get rid of automatic rifles, bump stocks, silencers and weapons of war. They were not part of the second amendment
879 2018-03-29 19:33:35 It's the nature of the market cycle. Happens in every market. Fortunately, Crypto occurs 2x, 5x faster than traditional stocks. So we should get through these market cycles fairly quickly.
880 2018-03-29 19:33:10 First they take the bump stocks, then they take the scopes. The silencers. The barrels, the bullets and then what’s left. THE LEFT

887 2018-03-29 19:28:13 Yes I am also bullish in long term nifty will hit 25 K level also but it's take time. Correction is part of market. 20-30% correction in index and 50-70% corrections in mid cap and small cap is normal. In any stocks market you will always find some corrections time to time.

889 2018-03-29 19:27:56 Particularly be careful of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO's) - as most (not all) are scams. (ICO's are more like stocks/shares (most worthless or very little prospect of success behind them), attracting new 'naive' investors, then dump the market once the attraction has matured).
890 2018-03-29 19:27:50 Well bump firing requires a special mounting and I'm fine with banning bump stocks. My issue with the legislation to do that, though, is that the text of the law is too vague and could be used to ban other devices that don't make a gun fully automatic
891 2018-03-29 19:27:14 Still watching it, its ugly, when the Dow and SPY started dipping this week I stay mostly in cash anytime that happens, also its a short trading week as the market is closed tomorrow so I just make a watchlist of stocks to watch.

898 2018-03-29 19:23:50 I like 'building wealth', but I think most people can relate more to 'saving'. I find the the majority of my coworkers are scared to death of the word 'investing'. They immediately think 'stocks' and 'crash' and 'recession'. Massively underinformed.
899 2018-03-29 19:23:38 Would they offer up the same apologies and tears if they hadn't have been caught? Course not. Glad the book has been thrown at them. The arrogant untouchables are now the laughing stocks #SandpaperGate #SAvAUS

903 2018-03-29 19:22:13 ban assault rifles, bump stocks, install cameras in schools , metal detectors,u really need to be told how to do ur job
904 2018-03-29 19:21:49 then we agree. you shouldn't equate stricter gun laws to complete gun bans because that's not what the "media" is saying - the 2nd amendment is necessary but was created in a time when semi automatic rifles and bump stocks didn't exist. It's only common sense to have regulation
905 2018-03-29 19:21:44 @TradeIdeas1 Dan - is there a way to see all stocks that meet a criteria in general (not just the current day)? A full list of stocks that meet a particular filter in TI.

908 2018-03-29 19:20:26 @CNNPolitics @cnn @MSNBC 

DOW UP OVER 400 POINTS TODAY !!!

WHERE IS YOUR SIDE BAR SHOWING THIS???  
YOU ONLY SHOW SIDE BAR BANNER WHEN STOCKS ARE IN THE NEGATIVE
909 2018-03-29 19:20:01 So u ban bump stocks-even the NRA isn’t against that. It’s the calls 4 banning a gun in the 1st place because it looks scary that’s the issue-whether you agree with that call or not, those calls have been made. It’s not for u 2 tell someone what’s necessary-owners get to choose.
910 2018-03-29 19:19:39 Stocks were above estimates
911 2018-03-29 19:19:26 “Dominic Monaghan Discusses the Catastrophic, Plummeting Rate of Fish Stocks” is the best PR email I’ve gotten in a long long while. I’m ready to face this week no…it’s Thursday?
912 2018-03-29 19:19:04 Sure - right after we ban assault riflesand bump stocks
913 2018-03-29 19:18:49 oh yeah,.

917 2018-03-29 19:17:35 The left demonizes the NRA, membership goes up.  Kuereg tried to demonize Hannity, their stocks went down along with all these other companies.  It is the elites who threaten a massive sell off that scare these companies.  Which means they are pulling David Hoggs strings.
918 2018-03-29 19:17:04 Because @realdonaldtrump said bump stocks were under very strict control! How dare you question what the smartest man in the world says??? (excuse me; I have to go vomit....)

920 2018-03-29 19:15:35 @Market I just read your article about 3-stocks you’ll own “forever” &found your honesty refreshing concerning the “mistakes” you’ve made. Anyone who has invested money has similar stories if they are honest. Nice to hear. I’m with you on Apple & I would recommend BRK.B 4U

924 2018-03-29 19:14:38 Tactic: 1)Buy the dip with at least the same amount to make your portfolio loss Half % . But do this only for the stocks of your portfolio where you really believe in. 2) ( do this not much) Sell stocks you hate with loss and put the money in stocks you see growing again in time.
925 2018-03-29 19:13:59 I don't see the appeal of bump stocks as they generally make shooting less accurate.  Also, most mass shootings involve handguns so not sure why all the concern over AR's.
926 2018-03-29 19:13:57 #gun #stocks are on a roll today. #ruger and AOBC are both up about 5%. Vista and Olin are also up.

933 2018-03-29 19:11:07 So it's okay for you to cheat on your taxes, outsource labor, refuse to uphold your end of business contracts, not pay employees and contractors, but you raise all Hell when a company operates legally. What's the matter Donnie? Amazon didn't buy you off with free stocks?

935 2018-03-29 19:09:27 You don't understand how this works. If I make 40 million a year, and now 60 million, I am not putting a significant amount of that 20 million into the economy. Maybe a house. But I have whatever I want already and it's going into MY portfolio, stocks, bonds, IRAs, etc.

939 2018-03-29 19:05:27 STOCKS:  Final hour of trading should be interesting as GOP PACS and Wall Street try to erase embarrassing 1st quarter loss in Dow and as "smart money" takes advantage of the rally to sell at better prices to reduce exposure to stocks.  @TheDemCoalition @TheDemocrats @DNC

Yes lots of us KNOW Trump cares about Americans. You don’t like America first? Don’t like less unemployment? Don’t like stocks soaring? Want more crap trade deals. 
Please spare us. YOU hate America, it couldn’t be more obvious.
943 2018-03-29 19:03:50 Mr. President, remember when you tweet this, you are not only hurting Bezos, but many of your loyal supporters who happen to work for Amazon .  We don’t want to see our stock plummet which also happens to be our yearly bonus.  We don’t get much of a raise, so we depend on stocks.

978 2018-03-29 18:51:03 Like for instance.  Fully- and semi-automatic weapons are not defined by rate of fire, but by the trigger mechanism.  One pull=one bullet means semi.  One pull=many bullets means fully.  Because bump stocks don’t alter that mechanism, they are still allowed!

987 2018-03-29 18:48:10 There is no real need for Congress to act, as this proposed rule recognises. NFA1934 is already adequate to rule bump stocks as machineguns. I do not expect any serious legal challenges to this.

1001 2018-03-29 18:44:20 This is excellent news. This is what *I* call "common sense firearms regulation". Bump stocks will be treated as "machineguns" under the terms of the National Firearms Act of 1934. This is the correct way to regulate. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. #RTKBA

1021 2018-03-29 18:37:59 WTI will finish up roughly 6.5% for Q1, and ECA will finish down roughly 18% for Q1. Go figure, big disconnect between oil prices and oil stocks. #OOTT
1022 2018-03-29 18:37:42 This proves nothing. Parkland shouldn’t have happened if Obama passed executive orders banning bump stocks and assault rifles. He had 8 years to do it, chose to cry on camera and point fingers. Sadly these kids are being used by adults as puppets.

1028 2018-03-29 18:36:34 General Question - KEY List - if key list is formed by so much filtration on IBD, Marketsmith, then why do very few, almost insignificant number of stocks move next day? Is it just Feb/March market issue? Or this is a typical performance of the KEY list?
1029 2018-03-29 18:36:32 @elonmusk @Tesla I can't afford to buy a Tesla yet, but I got Tesla stocks to support! I believe in the way you see humanity's future. Keep up the great work!

1039 2018-03-29 18:33:53 Murmurs from Trump, hard to understand, stimulated bulls (for some reason) to rip stocks higher. Maybe oversold and as we near support. My opinion, if you care, is a wide & volatile trading range shown in weekly charts posted yesterday.
1040 2018-03-29 18:33:50 @RajeevSula
1041 2018-03-29 18:33:39 Maybe 'Donnie & Co.' are playing the market with outbursts that target single Stocks? It is amazing that Congress who's bread & butter is tariff's & Trade allow Trumpkin to stray into their jurisdiction on a whim without repercussion.
*Breaking new ground & not in a good way.
1042 2018-03-29 18:33:39 Yes, and those estimates have short term impact at the least.   Do they ultimately determine a stocks performance ? No
1043 2018-03-29 18:33:29 Except for banning bump stocks (a very bad precedent) and expanding the failed fix NICS database, both of which piled onto Obama's gun control.
1044 2018-03-29 18:33:12 90 day comment period plus time to issue a final ruling, then a lawsuit to block the administrative ban. It could take years. Congress could ban bump stocks in a week but won't.
1045 2018-03-29 18:32:28 My side of the issue is as a former military officer, I support our Constitution.I’m for banning bump stocks and for enforcing current background checks and for law enforcement doing their job.  U just want to take my weapon b/c law enforcement screwed up in FL.  No, FL. Just no
1046 2018-03-29 18:31:39 Remember when bump stocks was all over the news until Trump said he’ll ban it and did...

1056 2018-03-29 18:29:38 Sinon H&M vos stocks vous pouvez me les passer ça me dérange pas
1057 2018-03-29 18:29:38 Yes your show was great except for one thing. U said u voted trump for jobs. Obama came in and 10.5% unemployment and stocks were 8000. Obama left office with 4.5% unemployment and 19000 stocks. Why was that so bad. Just a question.
1058 2018-03-29 18:29:23 Time for CREW to file another action against Trump. This is ridiculous. Even those who don't hold stocks are impacted by this - it's in nearly everyone's retirement plan stock holdings - even if they don't know it.
1059 2018-03-29 18:29:15 Why quote this when he’s using executive action to curtail our rights? Sure, bump stocks are a gimmick, but it’s only the start. I don’t think he’s our strongest advocate.
1060 2018-03-29 18:29:12 I have made a 1% profit on my stocks in one week and feel like a total Wall Street genius. That's, like, almost a dollar! #stock #stockmarket #daytrading
1061 2018-03-29 18:29:09 @Netflix  With this Susan Rice thing just watch your stocks tank.
1062 2018-03-29 18:29:02 When does Trump not lie? The bump stocks aren't going anywhere. He is all talk. He hasn't done anything in regards to gun control. Nothing. And, he never will.
1063 2018-03-29 18:28:36 You realize that he invested all of his money into stocks and savings and doesn't really need to work that hard right? Will played his cards the right way to ensure his future.
1064 2018-03-29 18:27:57 So a campaign speech instead of infrastructure speech. RT .@ddale8: Trump falsely claims, “We got rid of the bump stocks. The bump stocks now are under very strict control.” His administration’s proposed regulation is still in the mandatory comment period, hasn’t been finalized.
1065 2018-03-29 18:27:45 @DavidDobrik when are you going to sell your Tesla stocks? #Tesla#views#lolrip#fireflys
1066 2018-03-29 18:27:38 Make sure to change the law so it doesn’t get challenged, bump stocks don’t fit the definition of automatic weapon. The definition of automatic weapon will need to be changed.
1067 2018-03-29 18:27:36 Talking specifically about abolishing the 2nd amendment, nothing more. Still need the will of Congress to make law and a president to sign it. Also, most polls show sensible gun laws (i.e. banning bump stocks, large magazines) are acceptable.

1074 2018-03-29 18:25:40 Trump declares that bump stocks are now strictly regulated. Apparently he failed to read excellent @RegStudies article today on why regulating takes so long.
1075 2018-03-29 18:25:19 "the bump stocks are very strongly under control."  What does that even mean?
1076 2018-03-29 18:24:49 .@realDonaldTrump says no one is reporting how his administration banned bump stocks and provided $6B for opioids. Clearly he doesn’t watch @wsyx6. Both have been widely reported.
1077 2018-03-29 18:24:40 Trump says "we got rid of the bump stocks, the bump stocks are very strongly under control." Uh...
1078 2018-03-29 18:24:03 Global stocks set for worst quarter since 2015...

1083 2018-03-29 18:22:00 Arguing the amount of shootings is not the point. Where was Obama efforts to curb gun control? He coulda passed executive orders banning bump stocks and assault style guns and we wouldn’t have even had the Parkland shooting. #GirlBye #ComeWithSomeBetterFacts
1084 2018-03-29 18:21:53 It's not just slipping, or accidental push that's the only potential hazard, yellow line was measured as distance the ICB would whip out if it snapped from train. Lot of drivers don't know this as they've never driven older stocks with them on, but worthwhile pointing out
1085 2018-03-29 18:21:35 Looks like we're just back to one of those plain old boring weeks when stocks go up
1086 2018-03-29 18:21:34 I should add that saying "USD" is the base pair in stocks is again only seeing a slice of the pie.  Say you make a bunch of USD in stocks - you then need to consider hedging that wealth if USD is weaker versus say another fiat currency or BTC/ETH/LTC etc.
1087 2018-03-29 18:21:08 Stocks don't shoot up over night. It's the long game you play, not the short that create wealth. 

Amazon was in the teens in the nighties... They are worth $1500 a share today. They sold books only... Now it's everything!

1116 2018-03-29 18:09:54 No, New IPOS are great for swing trades-- I've done a lot of research on them.  But for now, I'm focused on stocks I can take a holdable trend.  newer IPOs aren't so good for that.  They tend to fly and die.
1117 2018-03-29 18:09:45 But you're not talking about stocks, right?

1141 2018-03-29 18:00:50 I'm still unable to wrap my head around election of con-man #Trump; religious-fanatic VP Pence; white supremacist advisors; appointees destroying public ed, EPA, etc; #LasVegasMassacre & why bump stocks aren't yet banned, Manafort as campaign mgr & everything #RussiaGate & .

1143 2018-03-29 18:00:28 Here are five takeaways from markets this week and quarter 

1.  Technology stocks are losing their teeth. 
2. Tariffs matter
3. 10-year yields pulled back and even slipped under 2.8% 
4.  Exuberance is fading, 
5.  Brexit: One Year to Go
1144 2018-03-29 18:00:27 Hi, appreciate the civil approach!  For the mags + bump stocks I'm generally concerned about the creeping restrictions, but don't see how these bans improve anything in VT or beyond. The burden of proof (why I should approve, not why I should oppose) is on anyone proposing it.
1145 2018-03-29 18:00:20 I see now the real purpose of your SF break! By the way did you buy the stocks a few weeks ago? Nevertheless, driving the product is the best way to confirm your decision. Great product. Good decision.
1146 2018-03-29 17:59:46 Stocks are back to where I like them 
1147 2018-03-29 17:59:19 Perfect now we know where they stand..no more support for those companies..watch their stocks go into the toilet..it's not going to go as all the liberals think...stand by to stand by
1148 2018-03-29 17:57:58 Personally I think bump stocks are dumb. My main three oppositions to regulating them are:
1. We are requiring people to divest themselves of property they acquired legally without compensation. 
2. Stocks aren’t required. Bump fire can be achieved in other ways.....
1149 2018-03-29 17:57:24 EOQ into Easter weekend, where stocks resurrect like Christ.

1155 2018-03-29 17:54:06 They aren’t trying to ban are they. Isn’t it control I.e no access to certain weapons, bump stocks, registration etc at nationwide level not state.
1156 2018-03-29 17:54:03 No one is saying "I have a right to whatever I want." Gun proponents have said banning bump stocks is a fine idea. They aren't asking for RPGs and tanks. It is the other side of the debate that is demanding things change without talking about truly common sense measures
1157 2018-03-29 17:53:32 Ive not been too successful with low price stocks partly because my price structure on Interactive Brokers prohibits due to cost. Thousands of shares can get very spendy.
1158 2018-03-29 17:53:15 More guns? or just leave the fucking laws the way they are and focus on the real probelm(s)?  R u that naive?  Again I ask u  what happens when u ban bump stocks? Or ARs? Is problem going to goaway ?

1165 2018-03-29 17:52:02 You can know everything about trading stocks without trying it, the point is someone with absolutely no practical or theoretical knowledge about a subject shouldn't be the one to decide how things within that subject should work. Do you watch any UIM streamers/youtubers?
1166 2018-03-29 17:52:01 Tony, you were the person I laughed with every day. I’d walk into pe and talk to you the entire time we’d be in algebra 2 and give each other answers you’d tell me how to do stocks and you’d tell me about your life and future.. I’m so sorry tony..

1168 2018-03-29 17:51:34 Some people are too smart for their own good. Somehow they think their company's stocks are going up because of things they are doing. Forget knowing the rules, they don't even know which game they're playing.

1170 2018-03-29 17:50:51 Bro... 3 years ago, the Rams, Eagles, and Jags were the laughing stocks of the NFL, and now they have the best D Lines in the whole league and are playoff contenders. That’s crazy.
1171 2018-03-29 17:50:42 Almost all guns used in mass shootings are acquired legally or stolen. The only crime I'm aware of using bump stocks was the Vegas shooting. The shooter in Florida got 17 using 10 round magazines. The policies you propose will not help, and when a shooting happens...
1172 2018-03-29 17:50:27 They need to both allow and increase funding toward research + mental health programs 

As well as including universal background checks, require safety training, deny ppl w a domestic abuse history, raise the min age, prohibit bump stocks & other types of rapid-fire automation
1173 2018-03-29 17:48:03 A man who cannot count probably do not know anything about stocks, probably some cognitive limitation there. Someone "who hasnt heard a language" doesnt speak the language and wouldnt function as a translator. You can know everything about fire caves without trying it.

1178 2018-03-29 17:46:57 Love Tanked but do wonder about fish stocks, etc.
1179 2018-03-29 17:46:54 Are you also seeing the companies buying back their stocks (this makes them more money) with the tax breaks? Yeah, even in your district. Several. Neat.
1180 2018-03-29 17:46:29 Besos will manipulate the stocks and make that money back!
1181 2018-03-29 17:46:25 The President of the United States is using his influence, as well as blatant lies, to drive down the stocks of Amazon just because he's jealous of Jeff Bezos' position as the world's richest man.  Let that sink in.

1183 2018-03-29 17:45:58 Must have lost heavily in stocks and trying to recover the easy way
1184 2018-03-29 17:45:54 But crypto isn’t viewed as a currency by regulators in the US, as property. Taxed like stocks.
1185 2018-03-29 17:45:32 @Allstate just pulled all@my stocks out of Allstate
1186 2018-03-29 17:44:40 NRA doesn’t do what you think it does and your right isn’t actually under threat(unless you specifically hunt with semi auto AR15 type weapons with bump stocks)so even if they did it’d be an easy task.
1187 2018-03-29 17:44:34 My investments are moving to the US. Canadian stocks are doing very poorly and with the carbon tax on the way, doing business in Canada is only going to get more expensive and less profitable.

If only the Minister of Finance would share his picks, we could all profit as he does!
1188 2018-03-29 17:44:19 .@pestononsunday @itvnews If economy tanks after #brexit can we have stocks in every city across UK, each one to have leaders of Leave campaign in them, plenty of rotten fruit due to no immigrants to pick it. #PeoplesRevenge
1189 2018-03-29 17:44:00 How about a man who has never learned how to count, would you trust him to trade stocks for you? Or someone who has never heard a language, would you let them be your interpreter? You have no experience with the gamemode, you shouldn't decide what it can or cannot do.
1190 2018-03-29 17:43:06 I’m working on it, I canceled Netflix in 2016 and 2017 when Soros bought some their stocks but the wife and kids wanted it back. #BoycottNetflix
1191 2018-03-29 17:42:40 Do people really think I will take their “buy these stocks!” advice from them? Hey! Great idea man! ( takes wallet from pocket, dips in gasoline and lights it)
1192 2018-03-29 17:42:25 Pretty incredible how cheap stocks seem today vs. yesterday...
1193 2018-03-29 17:42:12 Ignorant, clueless,  and delusional. Changing the age to 21 and banning bump stocks does zero to reducing violent crime and shootings. If you wanna prevent mass killings protest planned parenthood. They kill 670,000 babies a year. But that's not politically correctnow is it?
1194 2018-03-29 17:40:44 Somebody prob made a bad business decision and missed the opportunity to make bank on Amazon stocks 
Also @realDonaldTrump needs to release his taxes!
1195 2018-03-29 17:40:17 Bonds and stocks at HOD. End of quarter antics
1196 2018-03-29 17:39:19 Bump stocks were approved by the Obama Justice department, just for the record..
1197 2018-03-29 17:39:14 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
1198 2018-03-29 17:39:01 Street stocks is where it’s at boys
1199 2018-03-29 17:38:47 Pretty much the same everywhere,for some reason all shops seem tae have limited stocks,everywhere.
1200 2018-03-29 17:38:17 In my 20 years of trading I have never seen such rampant and blatant fake bids and asks as I have in these MJ stocks the past couple months.
1201 2018-03-29 17:37:50 Is that the free market the USA  champions for years? A seating POTUS playing with stocks of a company. What a joke! Where are we going? God please help us! I am sure smart folks will bring lawsuits for things like these.
1202 2018-03-29 17:37:42 Yup, instant irreversible deliver in whole things that are also perfectly anonymous. Which aren't really a big part of human commerce (and can be dealt with easily with some trust, which stocks require anyway) but somehow made to sound like they are.
1203 2018-03-29 17:37:31 Anyone check horse stocks?
1204 2018-03-29 17:37:25 On that measure, I’m going out to buy 6 slide fire bump stocks right now. Because why the hell not? They’re insignificant.
1205 2018-03-29 17:37:22 Ordered it to a friend I’m visiting in the US and just opened the parcel today  (you’re over for phoy right? Sephora stocks it if you don’t have time to order ahead online. Or give me a shopping list and I can probably pick some things up for you and bring them)
1206 2018-03-29 17:37:21 You better have someone in your social media department see how others who have done this to Conservatives bode. It won't end well. Stocks for companies who give in to a very tiny percentage of leftist, will fall tremendously. Billions have been lost from these political moves.
1207 2018-03-29 17:37:12 (2/2) the true aim, give us an inch and we’ll take a mile. This was a direct reference to bump stocks and desire to take all guns. I’ve no issue with increasing security, adding armed guards, metal detectors, walls, safe rooms, what have you, but you can’t legislate evil.

1279 2018-03-29 17:29:32 Liar, Obama did not legalize bump stocks.  In fact he issued EO's creating stricter controls all of which you rolled back.  He could not legally restrict non mechanical bump stocks without new laws.  Your buddies in Congress refused.
1280 2018-03-29 17:29:21 I am a Democrat AND a gun owner. You can support the 2nd amendment and RESPONSIBLE gun control laws. I have no problem with a ban on military style weapons, bump stocks and closing the gun show loophole.

1463 2018-03-29 17:02:43 Did you not actually get fired for something to do with the reporting of stocks and shares?? Something in the back of my mind tells me
1464 2018-03-29 17:01:27 Taxes as I said will revert back to what they were in 2020 so there's no real claim there. Investing in what? The stocks are down and going down further. Iran had nuclearized weapons which they do not now just power plants.
1465 2018-03-29 17:01:16 Border crossings are not down?  Stocks are still up 4-5 Tril from Obama. New deal on fair trade with SK, Half the fighters in AF couldn't fly combat, same for ground vehicles.  You think NK nuclearized just during Trump?  Good Grief.  A little history of that will help you.

1469 2018-03-29 17:00:36 "Wise" it's a stretch. It's more like "it's a fair move". And you're right, it's their money. I mean, they could have donated the money or helped people out and made the world a better place... But they chose to buy stocks so they could control what happens to their favorite-
1470 2018-03-29 17:00:24 @xodannica Look around for a cutting-edge financial advisor.  Stocks are back up, crypto is way down.  There are new things on the horizon.  Our returns are too low for the amount invested in stocks, still haven't bought into crypto - feeling like we should be ready to move. THX!
1471 2018-03-29 17:00:16 Well Done @don_prusha, can't be more clearer. These kids let the toothpaste out of the tube. They said if we get bump stocks, we'll take a mile. Do you know, IN POLITICAL TERMS, what that means??

1492 2018-03-29 16:53:04 Is inventory stocks only so@low because of the large exports it has been able to do due to refinery problems in Laramie. Brazil and Mexican refinery problems should be partly alleviated in the coming months.

1502 2018-03-29 16:50:01 Largest single day corn move since Aug 31st, 2017.  Quiet here from a hedge perspective too - think it ultimately takes new highs for producers to engage again.  One thing to keep in mind, the bearish corn stocks surprise offsets at least a million less acres planted.

1505 2018-03-29 16:49:29 Sorpresivamente, el USDA marcó una reducción del área que será sembrada con soja en EEUU, cuando el mercado la estimaba récord. También redujo la previsión para el maíz.

1510 2018-03-29 16:48:54 Pres. Trump didn't cause their stock to fall.  The story by Axios did.  Have you ever considered the possibility the story was planted by an investor who "shorts" stocks to make an instant profit?  It happens all the time, just ask @CGasparino
1511 2018-03-29 16:48:52 thread: Is this the end of remarkable #Amazon bull market. For several days its fans ignored Google & Facebook slide. Trump's revenge against Bezos, publisher Washington Post? Tweets about “concerns” Amazon isn’t paying enough taxes & damages US Postal Service. #stocks
1512 2018-03-29 16:48:34 Good for you for avoiding the crooks! You prolly take good care of yourself, and that's by far the best approach. I was born with some nasty health issues and my insurers cover very little of my treatments. So I buy insurance stocks to pay for it. The best business in the world!
1513 2018-03-29 16:48:26 That’s not true. Thought bump stocks were being banned, for example.
1514 2018-03-29 16:48:12 Stocks have been yo-yo’ing. Mostly negative. Last I checked, when I hear “stocks are down” that isn’t a good thing.
1515 2018-03-29 16:47:51 THE BEST STOCKS TO BUY RIGHT NOW ARE THE FOLLOWING:
Germany 30 FDAX, Ripple XRPUSD, Oil CL, GBP/USD GBPUSD, Gold XAU, US-TECH 100 NQ, EUR/USD EURUSD, Bitcoin BTCUSD.  These stocks are performing very well and they are very popular at the moment.

1519 2018-03-29 16:46:48 Talking about what Parkland students asking for. Sure, there are those on left who want repeal. There are extremes on both sides. What the heck is wrong with common sense regulation like banning assault rifles or bump-stocks. 2nd A says “well REGULATED militia”.

1523 2018-03-29 16:46:13 it's way too front heavy. Esp when I add 2.4l of water. But it should improve as I eat through my stocks.
1524 2018-03-29 16:45:53 Maybe because president Trump has already declared a national ban on bump stocks through the justice department?
1525 2018-03-29 16:45:43 still has shares and stocks in city group facebook tweeter and other companies.       right now I am concern for women children and men in Yemen and Syria and Palestinian which been homeless and displaced.

1528 2018-03-29 16:44:29 Your assurances mean nothing when you chip away at the 2nd Amendment on a regular basis. I don't care about bump stocks, but it is just one more step in gun control. As is NICS, 21 year age limit, longer wait/more background, and etc. YOU ARE killing the 2nd Amendment! :(

1577 2018-03-29 16:27:20 Your a fool because economy is falling now and stocks are jumping up and down and the VA is a mess because trump had to fire his swamp creature for using all the money on travel. But hey if you call it great then i guess it is. Fool and sheep never see in front of their won faces
1578 2018-03-29 16:26:59 Hah, yes. It’s one of my favorite stocks because shareholders perennially wait for some inexplicable rise in ag prices that will somehow help them and some inexplicable growth in their unrelated distraction business of the “road zipper”
1579 2018-03-29 16:26:47 I personally disagree. These bots are closer to something like Netflix or Shopify in my mind than to Cryptos. When you buy Taskbot or w/e you're paying the creators for a product to work as advertised. When you buy cryptos or stocks or shit, you're betting on company growth
1580 2018-03-29 16:26:45 And I'd like to see him in the stocks, but (sadly) it's not going to happen ...

1587 2018-03-29 16:25:50 For example: I have nothing against assault rifles, per se. I am deeply opposed to the accessories that turn them into weapons of mass slaughter. For example, high cap mags, drums, and bump stocks. The biggest problem is that every time I have seen a response on....

1685 2018-03-29 16:15:57 The implications of the (SSR) Short-Seller Restriction that is in place today:

Once the price goes up they will not be able to place bets to short it down.

1695 2018-03-29 16:13:49 1)Get rid of and/or outlaw bump stocks, high capacity magazines, noise suppressors, trigger modification kits. Create a mandatory 5 day cool down period after purchasing a fire arm of any kind before allowing the prospective gun owner to pick up the weapon and take it home.

1718 2018-03-29 16:07:44 It is exactly that. Stocks are blood letters for the corporate world sucking the blood that the workers put in.

1726 2018-03-29 16:05:37 DO NOT LOOK AT THE STOCKS!
1727 2018-03-29 16:05:33 ARs are military style semi-automatic weapons that can easily be converted to act as automatic weapons. Bump stocks can be made from wood at home. 
Not a constructive solution.

1731 2018-03-29 16:04:43 Quarterly Grain stocks were slightly bearish to corn and soybeans with both slightly higher than expected.  Wheat was as expected.  Note quarterly stocks for corn will be a new record high for this time of year @AgCountry @AgCRob
1732 2018-03-29 16:04:41 Corn stocks in all positions on March 1, 2018 totaled 8.89 billion bushels, up 3 percent from March 1, 2017.
1733 2018-03-29 16:04:32 Your right, the 17 kids killed at Parkland don't have legs to stand on anymore. Mental health, background checks, waiting periods, banning bump stocks and silencers do not infringe on anyone's #2A. As a matter of fact it enforces it. "well regulated militia" #MarchForOurLives
1734 2018-03-29 16:04:32 Honestly I don't oppose the bump stocks ban. I think the hysteria over it being anti 2A is ridiculous. Technically any regulation on gun purchase is infringement of 2A but we banned auotomtic weapons decades ago, a decision that was considered common sense by both parties.
1735 2018-03-29 16:04:26 stocks....seem like they temper the acreage enthusiasm.

but acres is a sexier issue
1736 2018-03-29 16:03:58 You shouldn’t own common stocks if a 50% decrease in their value in a short period of time would cause you acute distress

1890 2018-03-29 15:39:06 It's not black and white.

Some want to see the 2nd repealed.

Some want to ban mods like bump stocks, only.

Some want 'scary looking' guns like AR15 banned, only.

Some want to restrict who can legally own guns, only.

Some want a combination of above.

Some don't care at all.

1895 2018-03-29 15:37:48 US 10y Treasuries are bid and JPY is bid (after yesterday's hammering), but stocks are also bid and JPY Volatility Options offered. So risk aversion in Bonds and Spot FX, but Risk-on in Option FX and stocks. 
Time to just go home I think and wait for it to be logical once more.
1896 2018-03-29 15:37:43 Maybe Le Trump tweets about companies so their stocks go down/up & his cronies can sell/buy. Or he just hates Bezos because he’s a real gazillionare. Gas/oil, transportation, pharmaceuticals- you name it he’s got a crazytodder tweet. #resist #25thAmendmentNow

1907 2018-03-29 15:34:45 It's entirely likely the President is just expressing his opinion but of course speculation could lead thoughts in the direction that he is trying to hurt owner of @washingtonpost.

1934 2018-03-29 15:26:17 What do you say about the "well bump stocks can modify any of them into automatic weapons so any gun that can be modified into an automatic weapon should be banned" argument?
1935 2018-03-29 15:26:10 The NRA isn't blameless, either, when it comes to creating conditions where mass shooters can easily obtain bump stocks and defeat the current rules against fully automatic weapons without the much more extensive background checks, for example.

1943 2018-03-29 15:24:19 This protest is about banning bump stocks and weapons intended for military use... it was never about repealing the 2nd amendment and those trying to twist it into that exposes the need to distort facts in order to justify your position of no compromise
1944 2018-03-29 15:23:51 Update from the road
 Stocks up nicely this morn, but TREND STIIL DOWN, FULL HEDGES ON. Still in sideways range. Enjoy the ride everyone!
1945 2018-03-29 15:22:55 SO MARK ALLOWED A CHINESE / BRITISH COMPANY ACCESS TO "SPY" ON 250 THOUSAND ACCOUNTS, WHICH IN FACT THE COMPANY "TOOK," SPIED ON 7 MILLION ACCOUNTS. THEN MARK TAKES BILLIONS, OUT OF HIS FB STOCKS. IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT?

1948 2018-03-29 15:22:20 The problem is neither side wants to make these minor compromises. 21 to buy, Psych Evan & Background check no bump stocks? and everyone is upset? If both sides do not compromise -both sides will lose. Mark my words.
1949 2018-03-29 15:22:12 Ok so you get all the AR15s banned and destroyed, no magazines are above 10 rounds, bump stocks are gone, and everyone has a background check. What is your plan when someone does the same thing with a Lever action designed in 1894 or a pump shotgun.
1950 2018-03-29 15:21:45 Thanks for tanking my retirement in Amazon stock. I pay state taxes with each purchase from Amazon. Please just zip it as you are hurting Americans worse each time you open your mouth as stocks dip. Your tax reform helps Amazon too.
1951 2018-03-29 15:21:00 Bump stocks aside (Trump is for banning those) you do realize there are drum mags for many weapons? All weapons could technically be a weapon of war. It's the evil person behind the shootings to blame and try and stop beforehand you should be calling for.
1952 2018-03-29 15:20:57 Man #crypto is amazingly painful about to move back to stocks ouch
1953 2018-03-29 15:20:44 Not a mixed message at all. Bump stocks are not a weapon in itself, not a part of a weapon, & not needing Congress to ban them (they didn't allow them). Gun lobby kept Congress from enacting ANY gun control laws in 25 YRS! Sensible gun control laws way overdue! That's the mile!
1954 2018-03-29 15:20:38 I think you're right - I like #PNN - over 5.5% Divvy and as you say Corbyn going well out of fashion as his disgusting views on everything get exposed. Big Divvy Stocks got really hit for long time and finally they look like turning up.

1975 2018-03-29 15:13:54 I have no prob with a ban on bump stocks.   Wonder why Obama allowed those.
1976 2018-03-29 15:13:25 I would use it to pay for college, then kickstart my own business and/or invest in dividend stocks or mutual funds. over time that money would grow exponentially.Warren Buffett simply lives off the dividends of the stocks he owns,anyone with enough money to invest can do the same
1977 2018-03-29 15:13:14 We've wanted to be buying stocks and sectors this week showing both relative strength and positive momentum. I think if the 14-day RSI has stayed above 30 this year, it's a good place to start looking

1984 2018-03-29 15:11:53 But please humour us. What's Obama's position on Guns & NRA? He had 8 years to change gun laws, why didn't he? What is President Trump's? He banned bump stocks, tightened background checks. tackled Hippo laws & mental health info in background checks, addressed school security!

2006 2018-03-29 15:05:43 It's got to be the difference between 16 Stocks and 41 or so - you will do really well in the Good Times but the flipside is pain when Markets are rough. I hate the latter so happier with lower Volatility overall.

2019 2018-03-29 15:02:52 I hear you. But ..dangerous phrase coming...it feels different this time. Even in the rolling bear of 2015..we had leadership hold up. Generals are dieing out there. I always felt that when stocks like Tesla fall, the Bull is in danger

2023 2018-03-29 15:01:16 Copper firm. Oil and gas stocks firm potash stock firm.  Major indices firm. All looking good that a good low was formed this week. Next week should be fun 
2024 2018-03-29 15:01:07 Bump stocks are more of a novelty thing. I personally don't want one because I prefer accuracy over wasting rounds but my choice isn't the defining choice for others. Some of the methods are legal, some are not. It depends on how it's done. Using a belt, for example, is legal.

2027 2018-03-29 14:59:47 The American public is overwhelmingly in favor of rational gun control.  More than 70% want AR-15 banned, age for purchase to 21, close background check gaps, bump stocks banned and other reforms.  The ONLY thing holding us back is GOP control of Congress so they can't vote.

2029 2018-03-29 14:59:14 The AR-15 is the consumer model of the M-16. The primary difference is a lack of full auto capacity, but other than that they are the same gun. Bump stocks can make an AR-15 functionally fully automatic.

2048 2018-03-29 14:52:09 I support a well regulated right to firearms that involve Federal licensing, insurance requirements and limitations on caliber and capacity. Do I support AR-15s, bump-stocks, assault rifles, large magazines? Nope.
2049 2018-03-29 14:51:47 I can't wait to see this DOJ regulation on bump stocks in court. They obviously have no understanding of firearms and it should be easily dismantled in court. They classify a bump fire stock as a machine gun as multiple bullets are fired from one pull of the trigger (?)

2062 2018-03-29 14:46:37 It doesn't sound like Siraj went to the same rally I did? DC's rally had clear goals - ban assault rifles & bump stocks, universal background checks, purchasing age to 21. ESPECIALLY in DC, more security in schools means a hostile environment & stronger school to prison pipeline.

2068 2018-03-29 14:44:45 Or...Maybe it's correcting with the rest of the market after a nearly 50% parabolic rise since just the beginning of this year???

Trump's early tweeting about stocks typically showed a very short-term decline with a bounce back to previous levels. He has no real effect.

Same reasons housing was; soaring prices - but incomes near flat and many nil.
2071 2018-03-29 14:42:41 Right.  That’s why my health insurance went up $200 a month while I lost previously covered benefits, my tax break was $60 while Trump will see $12,000,000, gas, food and rent prices are up and stocks down, and consumer protections rolled back.

2107 2018-03-29 14:31:47 Trump is affecting a fortune 500 company stocks that has been successful due to Bezos owning the Washington Post. They have apparently written unflattering opinions of Trump so he is tinkering with their stock price with his tweets. Illegal, where is the SEC?
2108 2018-03-29 14:31:02 The selloff in tech stocks is making a group of usually bullish short-term investors nervous. @StockTwits shows just 54% were bullish, down from nearly 90% at the beginning of the year. Bearishness increased sharply over that span.

Vermont is a gun owning state With many hunters but many believe in this.
2143 2018-03-29 14:20:13 I can’t believe I just did this! I sold all my handguns, rifles, mags, ammunition and bump stocks! I needed the money so I sold my entire stockpile to a guy who I met last week, we never exchanged names but I’d know his face. I feel so much better, no more guns for me!

2173 2018-03-29 14:08:52 No. Heath handed control of our waters to Brussels. Brussels opened our waters to all then as stocks declined rammed quotas on us. We should fish our own waters. EU boats can fish here under licence from us, not Brussels. We can set quotas in favour of us. Very simple

2212 2018-03-29 13:59:01 I get the sense that in his Amazon tweet Trump may be toying with impacting individual stocks from Twitter.  He might intend to leverage the influence later for his policies.  Then again, he may be oblivious.

2242 2018-03-29 13:51:19 Stocks rise and fall day to day based on emotion. Just because Trump tweeted something doesn't mean the intrinsic value of the company is decreasing, assuming he doesn't act on his words (which he usually doesn't). The stock will bounce back up. Play the long-term game.

2269 2018-03-29 13:43:16 How is this tweet constitutional? 
@Fahrenthold @brianstelter @maddow @maggieNYT @JoeNBC
@SRuhle @AliVelshi @AriMelber
Isn’t #Trump manipulating the stock market with targeted tweets on businesses? 
We should check on stocks bought & sold by 'Trump and Friends'.
2270 2018-03-29 13:42:39 YUP!  there has to be a law to stop him from tanking company stocks as he does!  AMZN down 39!  Cray Cray
2271 2018-03-29 13:42:19 Corollary to hyper partisanship is exclusive focus on political management of issues without ever considering the merits. This approach years back led to the collapse of East coast cod stocks.  Reality eventually overtakes the spin but often too late.

2274 2018-03-29 13:42:04 Yeah I really need to average down myself mate. Never imagined I would have to buying at 0.11p as I really thought that was far too cheap there but hey ho like U say its alot down to the poor markets which will recover and so will stocks like these hit hardest .
2275 2018-03-29 13:41:56 a rebound in stocks could give a boost to crypto.
2276 2018-03-29 13:41:46 Not a fan of bump stocks->Dumb Ban.
2277 2018-03-29 13:41:22 It’s the second day stocks should rebound but it’s very difficult when @realDonaldTrump shoot at Amazon
2278 2018-03-29 13:39:30 Is it me or $AMZN only going because it feels bad for the other FANG stocks

2280 2018-03-29 13:39:14 So egregious is the pollution of our cities by people like the Kochs and other antediluvian fossil fuel worshipers that scorn is not adequate. It almost invites a return of the stocks.
2281 2018-03-29 13:39:07 Ok. How about high capacity magazines?  Bump stocks?  That’s really all we want. And to end future sales of assault weapons.
2282 2018-03-29 13:38:44 ごめんな...合宿のセトリに純一入れるの忘れてたわ...
2283 2018-03-29 13:38:32 $drys got a Cramer pump, he would rather own $drys a $3.75 stock than $tsla which has a stock price of hundreds of dollars. Guess he likes stocks going up with good fundamentals.

2287 2018-03-29 13:37:33 Interesting fact;
While someone like Martha Stewart is jailed for Insider Trading related to unreleased information, the RepubliKKKan Congress has decided that is legal for THEM to sell off stocks before they crash if that info was obtained in a closed door meetings.
2288 2018-03-29 13:37:30 Can we bring back @BOTUS to short sell stocks after the President tweets about them? @planetmoney
2289 2018-03-29 13:36:55 Bump stocks are useless, dangerous toys. I couldn't care less.

Banning long gun sales to 18-20 year olds? Those can be bought across state lines, so unless every state does this, it will change nothing.

Besides, most mass shooters are older than 21.
2290 2018-03-29 13:36:14 It's a pretty transparent play: WaPo is owned by Amazon, WaPo keeps publishing stories Trump hates, Trump tweets to punish Amazon, Amazon stocks go down. Abuse of power, unethical, obstructive, but probably legal.
2291 2018-03-29 13:36:11 Last week, RU corn prices reached seasonal high7300 RUR/MT EXW European part,end-season stocks may plunge to record low 0.4 MMT–@sovecon

2292 2018-03-29 13:36:00 A1: Pump & Dump: As more and more investors buy shares, the value of the stock rises sharply. Once the price hits a peak, the scammer sells their shares and the value of the stock plummets. You’re left holding worthless stocks. #Fraudathon #FPM2018  3/3

2294 2018-03-29 13:34:44 $FB opens above yesterday’s close. Has the rebound begun? Lots of tech stocks at really attractive prices. $AMZN under attack now, could present a good buying opportunity soon. Stay tuned...
2295 2018-03-29 13:34:15 #stocks  Don't be surprised to see a full Good Friday wipe out today.  Asian markets are open on Good Friday, so don't get nailed then or again on Monday.
2296 2018-03-29 13:33:24 great read. we are bullish on bank stocks as well, specifically regional banks in the US. attractive opportunities on $CMA $ZION $BBT -- we ran risk reversal on $KRE
2297 2018-03-29 13:32:27 Although stocks may rally here due to the end of the quarter, the setup in breadth and growth sectors doesn’t look like it can produce a sustainable rally yet. $USD is up, bottoming may drag into April... $SPX

2303 2018-03-29 13:31:45 @Coles Hi - just curious why your Katoomba store no longer stocks veal? Also no one buys the pre marinated duck breasts - tell them to stock up on the non marinated duck breasts. Thanks.

2309 2018-03-29 13:29:58 Supposed to be watching stocks for the past month and I haven’t been watching shit 
2310 2018-03-29 13:29:49 My stocks say otherwise as they are reacting to his bombastic style.  He owes me roughly 10% right now
2311 2018-03-29 13:29:36 Other accomplishments include, banning bump stocks, fully funding Planned Parenthood, topping ANOTHER 1.3 trillion dollars to the federal deficit, taking 25 billion from the military to fund an invisible wall...not looking too good so far.
2312 2018-03-29 13:29:25 "Grab yours while stocks last."
2313 2018-03-29 13:29:20 "My stocks are going up. Higher than they ever were before I took over. Guess I'll throw a party or some shit."
2314 2018-03-29 13:28:31 There is a good chance 2 stocks trap shorts today and rip their faces off . Considering I only trade 10 names not hard to figure out lol . Let’s see if plays out . Have a great day
2315 2018-03-29 13:28:29 Stocks in the munchie sector should benefit as well
2316 2018-03-29 13:28:19 higher, even as traders stayed on the sidelines ahead of a long weekend amid concern over U.S. and China trade relations and an ongoing selloff for U.S. technology stocks.
2317 2018-03-29 13:27:52 I think he’s proved without shadow of a doubt that EVERYONE bar Putin/stormy goona get it  Watch those stocks drop 
2318 2018-03-29 13:27:40 As much as it may sound like it, they do not want to abolish it. The great majority of Democrats just ask for some reasonable reforms (and by the way, Trump himself supports part of the reform). Age restriction, ban bump-stocks, and perform both background and mental checks.
2319 2018-03-29 13:27:08 Kirenji, we in the northeast thank you for the role you've played in keeping the identity of the Mongoloid stocks with difference with other India in everything.
2320 2018-03-29 13:26:41 There is potentially some good.... the implosion of the Conservative party, the collapse of the foolhardy Hinckley C project and the collapse of the fishing industry will give fish stocks the potential to recover
2321 2018-03-29 13:26:13 Trump is pro steel ., steel stocks lost 33% from peak .$x .. trump is anti $amzn 
2322 2018-03-29 13:26:00 Come on Moussa go raise your stocks at the Bridge on Sunday... Go burn that bridge down Bro. COYS!!!!!!
2323 2018-03-29 13:25:25 Why attack Amazon an American company helping America's growth. Small businesses are dying in general, if it wasn't #Amazon it would be #Alibaba or #Walmart. Fix the laws--don't attack American companies and hurt growth/stocks further. @POTUS @business @MSNBC @JeffBezos @amazon
2324 2018-03-29 13:25:21 Amazon should sue our fat ass lying piece of shit so called President.
Amazon paid 957 million dollars in taxes last year. Trump claimed they paid NO taxes! Stocks fell and people lost money on investments because he is a lying Dumbass.
Sue the sorry bastard!!!
2325 2018-03-29 13:25:01 Pot stocks and pot
2326 2018-03-29 13:24:25 Knowing most stocks are efficiently priced, it's imperative to know how the co's underlying business momentum has been moving and if it can be sustained. Our research help with this information and eliminates guessing.
2327 2018-03-29 13:24:12 But the stock market gains correlate with all the QE money filtered in to stocks.
2328 2018-03-29 13:24:07 JUST SAYING: As I look at 1-yr daily MP charts, it's a scary thought when you realize that the most frequently traded price from 2017 is well below current levels in stocks, indices and index futures.
2329 2018-03-29 13:23:47 $intk - this will be one of the best turnaround stocks of 2018 - very very soon you will see - great work to those who grabbed the final dips yesterday IMO -
2330 2018-03-29 13:23:44 Stocks up, EM currencies rally thanks to market risk-off on strong #US GDP, eased geopolitical tensions, #USDRUB -0.31%
2331 2018-03-29 13:23:44 Being brutally honest, they are not the majority, nor a particularly high concern minority. And regardless, the ATF will be reclassifying bump stocks as Machine Guns if their latest rule proposal is passed, which is likely to be the case.
2332 2018-03-29 13:23:40 @realDonaldTrump attacking Amazon? Lies Lies Lies. He is ignorant to how it works. They ha e paid millions in taxes and do support Mom an Pop shops. Another example of his temper tantrum #stocks down Americans losing #money Big Time
2333 2018-03-29 13:23:33 Stock watchers... monitor these stocks over the next few months.
2334 2018-03-29 13:22:21 People who hate crypto miners for depleting stocks obviously never bought hyped shoes, that shit is 10x worse
2335 2018-03-29 13:22:13 So that’s the low down in Trumps failed businesses. 

As for Pelosi, her wealth comes from property and her husbands stocks in companies like Apple. Google it.
2336 2018-03-29 13:22:06 21 yrs old to purchase semi automatic weopons  ban bump stocks but grandfather all that are out there and like it or not armed security in our schools it's come down to that and eliminate gun free zones all these mass shootings are on soft targets
2337 2018-03-29 13:20:09 Wouldnt say that modeled just means looks. I mean they do have stocks, triggers, they fire bullets, these are all things military weapons have/do too. Of course paintball guns have 2 out of those 3 things....
2338 2018-03-29 13:19:46 But you put these 1st responders & law enforcement's lives in danger everyday by not working to ban bump stocks, automatic weapons, high capacity mags & military weapons.
You & the most corrupt administration in history are also the biggest hypocrites in history.

2345 2018-03-29 13:15:24 Stocks are hanging in there with some anticipation among option buyers for a bottom. A rally may not be a sustainable one, but S&P 500 Index closed in December at 2687. So, the quarter is ending, or 3% upside and also 3% downside risks for the next few sessions. $SPX
2346 2018-03-29 13:15:08 As I understand the bill, it raises the purchase age to 21, bans high capacity mags, bans bump stocks, and requires background checks for all purchases.  Am I wrong?

If not, do you oppose all of that?
2347 2018-03-29 13:14:49 Many argue why would someone spend 100 on pixelated knife. These people never see opportunities investing in assets other than stocks and bond
2348 2018-03-29 13:14:32 What crap the British fishing industry over fished COD and haddock and the CFP has ensured a recovery in stocks.

2350 2018-03-29 13:14:13 Traders waiting to see how US stocks fare, especially tech stocks..
2351 2018-03-29 13:13:28 @BillyBuckee we KNOW the NRA has your ear... but listen to your CONSTITUENTS! You work for US not NRA MONEY! Vote FOR 
a ban on bump stocks AND 
a ban on ghost guns!
We are watching 
@NewMilfordDems1 @ATCT_NF @ActTogetherCT
2352 2018-03-29 13:11:08 What makes you think radical progressives would stop at bump stocks and background checks?

From inclusiveness to diversity to hate speech laws, it's never enough for them.

It's never enough.
2353 2018-03-29 13:10:27 Restore the ban on semi-automatic and automatic assault weapons along with bump stocks & large capacity magazines. When the ban was in effect, the number of school shooting victims was 54.4 percent less than when it wasn't. Offer more mental health resources & coverage.
2354 2018-03-29 13:09:39 AM Mkts: #Corn +2; #Soybeans -3; Winter #Wheat +3. Weekly Export sales disappoint on YSB, within trade guess on YC. Flash sale of 265k MT of o/c YSB to unknown. #USDA Stocks & Acreage report @ 11am.
2355 2018-03-29 13:09:39 If I were a hedge fund trader and short stocks like AAPL, TSLA,FB I would close them out before the holidays. Close positions now, re-sell next month. Maybe that way we will see some shortcovering rally today.
2356 2018-03-29 13:09:15 @everyone keep all tech stocks on watch, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Tesla, etc... you get the point. Don't miss out on the money.
2357 2018-03-29 13:09:09 Market Update: stocks trade mixed ahead of long Easter break amid trade concerns.

2382 2018-03-29 12:57:44 Washington post = Amazon owner

Mr. Trump knows that we know his intention of going after Amazon stocks 
2383 2018-03-29 12:57:02 @Repower_Group where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
2384 2018-03-29 12:56:58 bad shop feedback. constantly lacking stocks even though it is in high demand. 1 out of 6 stars.
2385 2018-03-29 12:56:53 Jaw-boning single stocks up or down based on said company's perceived obsequiousness to the president is the new GOP Capitalism. Adam Smith would be so proud.
2386 2018-03-29 12:56:41 We of course wish we could be everywhere, but between now and then, Amazon CA stocks our coffees on Prime:) Letting us know that Bahroo sent you there is just as good as using his coupon code!

2388 2018-03-29 12:55:30 If you are freaking out that some people are freaking out about the stock market being down in last three freaking months, you are generating a lot of freaking noise, in other words, stop the ranting. @stocks

2392 2018-03-29 12:53:17 Everybody knows that man, AJ does too. Obviously he accidentally wrote tomorrow out of habit. Not really an "lol" thing, he lets everyone know when he takes a position; even when he knows people will hate on him. That's a confidant trader.
2393 2018-03-29 12:53:11 markets are auction-driven.  professor Joel greenblatt's Columbia biz first class is about how many stocks fluctuate 50% in a yr w/out much variance in fair value & sometimes little change in story.  if you buy right, you can let game play out, let the corporation do it's thing.

2397 2018-03-29 12:51:53 The Bond markets will close early at 2:00 p.m. ET today, while Stocks 
undergo normal hours. Tomorrow, all U.S. financial markets will be 
closed in observance of Good Friday.
2398 2018-03-29 12:51:43 My brother has used his AR many times to shoot deer. Why these dipshits think the only guns that can be used to hunt are bolt action rifles with wooden stocks is derptastic.
2399 2018-03-29 12:51:32 I think it's even more cynical. He realized his power over stocks and has his company and friends shorting whatever he targets with a heads up.

2401 2018-03-29 12:50:48 Stocks are higher across the Continent at quarter-end, amid a spate of news regarding billion of dollars-worth of cross-border corporate deals that were in the final stages or in the offing, 1/2.

2403 2018-03-29 12:49:50 A staggering 50% of S&P 500 stocks now yield more than US Treasury bonds . That compares to two thirds of all developed world debt offering negative rates and US Treasuries at 2.85%.

2405 2018-03-29 12:48:57 Let's hear it #ontag, which way do you think today's USDA Stocks and Acreage reports will push the market? Either way, should be gripping with there only being a couple hours for the trade to digest before markets close for the long weekend. #grains #cdnag #grainmarketing
2406 2018-03-29 12:48:36 This is getting right to change due to their political views. Not to mention Susan Rice should be in prison for deceiving the american people on Americans being killed in Benghazi. Shame on @netflix Stocks getting right to drop. #StupidMove
2407 2018-03-29 12:48:25 They hardly ever use USPS as vendors. My cards are on him having bonds and stocks with a competitor retailer and he’s trying to derail it. Classic way to generate strawman bias.
2408 2018-03-29 12:48:10 USDA at 11am CST today. Average corn acres guess is 89.42 million March 1 stocks 8.703billion bu. Soybean acres are expected to be 1-1.5 million above last year. Acres estimate is 91.056 million, March 1 stocks is 2.030 billion bu. Know more @ 11.01CST

AOL, YHOO, etc. Advertisers fleeing and content  getting stale. $TWTR likely in better spot IMO to be acquired.
2414 2018-03-29 12:46:43 Netflix dumb move. Stocks fell after talks about O tv and now Rice on Board of directors. Nice knowing ya.

2464 2018-03-29 12:17:46 Tough times dont last. Tough people do  Same thing applies to our stock picks. If ur portfolio stocks have the earning visibility and you are sure that the earning are bound to improve, this fall is a god send opportunity to add. Key is not to bet on "Borrrowed Conviction"
2465 2018-03-29 12:17:25 I don't think that one is affecting the other, rather it's as @TruthGundlach says--bitcoin is a leading indicator of market sentiment.  If the froth comes out of bitcoin, it likely will for stocks as well.

2491 2018-03-29 12:04:52 The ETF tax “loophole” simply makes it more like owning the component stocks directly rather than a less-efficient, old fashioned mutual fund (which I’d argue is an “anti-loophole” for buy and hold investors). Would such a tax change also do away with tax loss harvesting?

2517 2018-03-29 11:59:04 If you are an investor, volatility is a good thing. It's the reason long term average return of stocks is 10% (vs 6% for bonds). It's the premium you get for dealing with the volatility. Embrace it, don't fear it.
2518 2018-03-29 11:58:55 I wish I had invested in weapon manufacturing stocks. They must be raking in the profits this quarter from gun and ammo sales, thanks to @davidhogg111 and @Emma4Change and a few others, oh and HR5087 in the House right now. Awesome stock growth potential.

2522 2018-03-29 11:57:55 Not only rich can afford stocks. Stocks go up and down everyday. The stock market is a place for business people to gamble their money legally. Anyone can get stocks even the poorest of the poor. Sorry for your misunderstanding.

2526 2018-03-29 11:55:53 Let’s start with the assault rifle ban that worked so well after Reagan enacted it. Move on to banning bump stocks. Add in closing purchasing loopholes. I would also support licensing classes. That’s a start...
2527 2018-03-29 11:55:49 Banning bump stocks is an infringement too!! As well as useless!

2529 2018-03-29 11:52:45 Time to buy stocks
2530 2018-03-29 11:52:43 Also, by not allowing private citizens to have machine guns, bump stocks, biological, chemical and nuclear weapons in their own personal arsenals, the right to bear arms has been infringed. So let's have more of it.
2531 2018-03-29 11:52:19 These broker notes about valuation and how cheap stocks are funny. Market could certainly be oversold, but these notes are just disingenuous especially when I didn't see any analysts downgrading stocks as valuations were hit. Price targets just went up . Markets decide multiples.
2532 2018-03-29 11:52:13 We dont need bump stocks, collapsable stocks, licensing for full auto, 30 or 15 round mags. We do need better background checks, time delays on purchases, limits on quantities of ammunition bought. Nowhere did this mention taking away rights to own a gun!!

2591 2018-03-29 11:13:14 Die oplossing (het verbieden van assualt weapons en bump stocks en véél striktere controles op welke verwarde mensen die rotzooi allemaal kopen) werkt in zo ongeveer elk ander land ter wereld prima.

2592 2018-03-29 11:13:09 Recently read your investment mantra.  You buy stocks which has debt, when lot of negative news around it and when no one wants to own them. You hold them for many years to give multibaggar returns.  Now I understand why you support Congress.

2604 2018-03-29 11:07:27 The humiliation of three cricketers who "done us wrong" exemplifies the "put them in stocks in the village square" focus of social and traditional media.

2634 2018-03-29 10:47:45 I’m not bullish stocks here but do want to point out that #LIBOR #OIS spread is unchanged for 3 days. That’s not the problem. Neither are credit spreads $HYG $JNK the problems are real but not credit related.
2635 2018-03-29 10:45:45 The cost of sending 15 officials to Cannes to 'discuss' the UK housing crisis would go some way to replenishing food bank stocks,while taxpayers wait for  those 15 (fifteen??) people to get 'think outside the box'. Or they could just build more council houses.

2640 2018-03-29 10:43:44 When u looked at your folio in 2000 and in 2008 what is your reaction emmet. Since u spend lot of time in researching and writing about stocks, did u feel after 8 years, from 2000 to 2008 u are at the same point or did u find any silver lining?

2642 2018-03-29 10:42:43 If they just focus on tighter regulations for purchasing weapons  and bans on high-capacity magazines, assault rifles and bump stocks, this would all get a lot more support and at least moderately less pushback from the fringe.
2643 2018-03-29 10:42:34 Ms @Shehla_Rashid:In case you get a chance to visit HQs of Twitter,Facebook & Google you will understand that they don't comprise "communist labour".The creators are all capitalists.They get/own stocks of their company?Jack Dorsey is a CAPITALIST.Somebody teach you,but then....

2648 2018-03-29 10:38:10 Dusty, w/story stock like $FUZ it's usually all or nothing. No playing it safe. Scaling out of winners is not bad, but generally speaking, that type of behavior is better left to the Blue & Red chips of the world. With story stocks, esp, when owned from pennies, just let 'um run.
2649 2018-03-29 10:37:48 Why not Tencent instead? I've always been curious, is there a rule against discussion of OTC stocks on CNBC? I hardly ever hear OTC stocks (foreign ADRs, etc) given much focus aside from brief headlines/occasional guest mentions. Lots of BABA discussion on CNBC, rarely Tencent.
2650 2018-03-29 10:35:41 Columbine shooters had limited capacity magazines due to the weapons ban. They just brought more with them to the school. Bump stocks, I don't care for. More accurate shots made with semi automatic anyway... Army expirience
2651 2018-03-29 10:34:01 just do the whole armada thing and f up a lvl 3 cpu for like 99 stocks with like bread and butter stuff. and play with movement between stocks

2681 2018-03-29 10:19:06 Thank you. The new narrative that people want to take away all guns has been working to inflame the NRA base. No one has said that, but AR15, bump stocks and large magazines have no place in society. If people want them they can enlist. Happy hunting to you.
2682 2018-03-29 10:18:35 Wonder why people are going crazy and buying stocks in herd mentality!!! The bull party of 2017 is over. We are entering a long correction phase with no triggers to go up until 2019 results!

2714 2018-03-29 09:53:50 This correction has been an experience for most novice stock pickers

Many with 2-3 years experience were thinking stocks can never correct

No stock can escape Price/Time correction if the overall trend changes

This is just a 10% cut on index. In last decade many cases of 20%

2803 2018-03-29 08:40:47 It’s still up 7x from 01/17 , that’s a lot of price action for any asset in 1 1/4h year. If you held any of the FAANG stocks and were up 50% in one year you would blow a nut in your shorts. If it (crypto)craters I might go fiat and try to BTFD.

2806 2018-03-29 08:37:03 18X in 18 years is really pretty good. There can always be stocks ( in hindsight) which are up 30-40X in the same period. IMPOSSIBLE to state in 1999 which would be 18X or 30X. If one is ACTUALLY holding such a stock, anything above 15-16% CAGR is awesome !!

2815 2018-03-29 08:33:32 Crypto is not stocks. In stocks, usd is the base pair, in crypto btc is the base pair (you can also use eth but due to eth volatility its more confusing). Therefore the goal is to make more of the base pairing.

and bse sensex was at 1000

Today Gold is at around 30000 Rs.
and bse sensex is at 33000.
so Gold gave 9.3x return and Sensex gave 33x.
Still Majority of population think Gold is better investment.

If the required amount of work has been done properly while picking stocks, holding period should be almost forever.

If you find the fundamentals getting deteriorated continuously, you can exit the stock.

2889 2018-03-29 07:17:22 I think you've missed the point as to why BTC isn't a correlated asset lol it's not to do whether BTC moves in tandem with stocks but the fact that it has no centralised control and isn't subject to the whims of political parties etc. Look at Gold, that fell in 2008 as well lol
2890 2018-03-29 07:15:11 Yes but value stocks - quality companies with high free cash flow and a strong balance sheet - usually effectuate buybacks and high divis.

2895 2018-03-29 07:11:50 Hi Deepak,

I have been holding one of my stocks since 2011. 
The reason behind holding is that the fundamentals of the company are getting stronger and stronger every year.

For an individual stock, buy-&-hold policy should be followed as long as its fundamentals are strong.
2896 2018-03-29 07:11:08 Nobody stocks ammunition for over a week now.
For one thing, other countries quickly intervene and call for cease-fire within a week of war breaking out.
Also, large stockpiles are rendered useless by age.
Even a 10 day stock is luxury likely due to chances of a 2-front war
2897 2018-03-29 07:11:07 But we must educate our older kids if they're not following.

2957 2018-03-29 06:24:13 Agreed. The question is what would trigger it? Tech is doing great. Stocks are doing great. Economy is growing.

3006 2018-03-29 05:24:04 I am for requiring stringent background checks for any sales, including mental health,  a waiting period, and license and registration required to purchase and own just like a car. I am for banning bump stocks, AR15s and the like and large amounts of ammo. should be a limit.

3023 2018-03-29 05:11:21 As fish stocks diminish, and demand for seafood increases, fishing companies flout employment laws and environmental regulations.

3025 2018-03-29 05:08:43 Not saying * gun control * would help. Asking for federal background check, assault riffles, bump stocks and high cap mags ban is not necessarily gun control. These words triggers people for a reason.

3031 2018-03-29 05:03:11 @Ingenius31  to do all respect. The second amendment was used for hunting and to defend against the British which was 200 plus years ago so in my opinion I definitely don’t think you should have any bump stocks

3038 2018-03-29 04:57:45 You make an excellent point we ought to be banning certain hand guns too. Thanks for the advice. We can start with AR 15’s and bump stocks and large amounts of ammo bans, require background checks for all gun sales, license and registration too.
3039 2018-03-29 04:57:05 He is for sensible gun control he has already trying to pass legislation to get rid of bump, stocks, and has more in store for us on this. Americans should not lose their right to bear normal guns that can’t be turned into killing machines.
3040 2018-03-29 04:56:42 it's not reality ... yet. We can't address bump stocks, AR15s or radical Jihad terrorism appropriately... meanwhile there's convergence from the authoritarian, fascist Right (censor my social media?! Don't bake that cake!) and socialist Left ( muh Russia!) in smashing tech

3042 2018-03-29 04:56:04 I believe that even small changes can help. Arming teachers is a ridiculous idea aimed at selling more guns. I have several guns and I’m a good shot but I do not want a gun in my classroom. So many things could go wrong with that. At least we agree on bump stocks.
3043 2018-03-29 04:55:59 Due to Facebook recent's privacy scandal, it may deter advertisers and lead to tougher regulations. Facebook's stocks are still below 17% since March. #comm464
3044 2018-03-29 04:55:21 Key word being handguns. Not AR 15’s and similar guns, or bump stocks.

Comments welcome. 
3050 2018-03-29 04:53:16 Senstor Diane Feinstein doesn't waste any time! She also wrote legislation against bump stocks right after the Las Vegas shootings--but the GOP blocked it!
3051 2018-03-29 04:53:13 Fix-NICS and bump stocks. Not enough. They want universal healthcare, they get Obamacare, not enough. While the right is over here on our hands and knees begging for scraps.
3052 2018-03-29 04:50:44 The age of gun ownership shouldn't be raised for law abiding adults, and the banning of bump stocks won't change anything when you can still bump fire without one, and when people will likely create other mechanisms to simulate automatic fire anyways.

3055 2018-03-29 04:48:24 Bump stocks must go yes.. There are 170 guns identical to the AK/AR series. They just don't have the fancy dressings to look military, they are NOT assault weapons. That's a liberal term. How does banning them help schools when there are tens of millions of the same type guns?

3069 2018-03-29 04:30:29 Maybe you should turn off Fox News and think about what people are really asking for. Banning assault weapons and or  bump stocks and changing age limits do not add up to repealing the 2nd amendment.

3085 2018-03-29 04:17:06 Forgive me for labeling this incorrectly. As a democracy, we elect leaders we “trust” to attempt to create laws, amendments, etc. that hopefully reflect what we want.

2. You pushed an Unconstitutional EO to ban bump stocks, etc.
3. You made Diane

3112 2018-03-29 03:53:55 Correlation is increasing as the players are not focused on a singular market. In other words, folks who only held stocks may now hold bitcoin but they behave the same way regardless of their positions.
3113 2018-03-29 03:52:51 Good roundup. My only point is that markets peak out on the upside when companies' top lines & bottom lines are surging, as is happening in the US. We had just run ahead so need to wait for earnings to catch-up. Till then, it's a sideways mkt with random stocks rising/falling.
3114 2018-03-29 03:52:49 Who stocks them here
3115 2018-03-29 03:52:38 That is nonsense, aside from small business owners, almost everyone owns stocks or bonds that make them responsible for capital in the  economy.
3116 2018-03-29 03:52:27 Twitter stocks are tanking.
3117 2018-03-29 03:52:02 Kinda sucks how long it takes to get any sort of bill or law passed. Kind of like the bump stock ban, the same utility used the by the Las Vegas shooter. 

Ever since the news of the ban, stores have liquidated and now they are sold out of bump stocks everywhere. Fucked up.

3123 2018-03-29 03:47:22 I’m not aware of any legislation that’s been proposed that would even make a difference.
I’m all about more extensive background checks (although you’d think the fed’s bg check would be sufficient) and psych evaluations, but banning bump stocks is what was proposed...

3125 2018-03-29 03:46:41 Don't you want bump stocks to be legal? Don't you agree with the ATF's finding them to be legal under current law?

and lol, the wall is not "going up" and it's never getting built.
3126 2018-03-29 03:44:33 Hefty liquidity to be created owing to govt bonds worth Rs700bn maturing in April and Rs1 trillion short term MSS bonds issued last year may lend support to bond market keeping yield contained. Good for Banking stocks.
3127 2018-03-29 03:44:09 Thats the whole point of stocks lol. They're all gambles
3128 2018-03-29 03:44:09 RIP "The Social Bubble" 2010-2018

1990's Dot-com bubble: Nasdaq peaks March 10, 2000

Aughts: July 31, 2007 NYSE peaks

March 15, 2018 "FANG" stocks peak
3129 2018-03-29 03:43:32 Very Important aspect to be kept in mind while making a decision to invest incremental capital in stocks "cutting the weeds and watering the flowers"
3130 2018-03-29 03:41:43 Have you thought about different paper stocks?
3131 2018-03-29 03:39:43 Better sell those stocks son
3132 2018-03-29 03:39:33 +5.1k another tough day, only Traded 9 stocks today, with 3 shorts and 6 longs. Been very quiet day, very hard to eek something out but manages a small win! the small wins can make a big one if you do it enough! happy Easter everyone! Stay safe!
3133 2018-03-29 03:38:57 Its in 190 countries. 190. The stocks you should invest in are on startups. Not a major company where just introducing a new feature makes stocks drop
3134 2018-03-29 03:38:53 Wonderful Rush→ MIRACLE RUSHは個人的に好き
3135 2018-03-29 03:37:53 Are buybacks included in both red and blue pills? How about mutual funds loading up on stocks that "aren't expensive" is that purple too?
3136 2018-03-29 03:36:35 No bump stocks. 
Magazine limits to 15.
Limits on the stopping power of weapons civilians have access to.

3138 2018-03-29 03:34:46 Would be cool to hear some of your opinions/analyze on metals and stocks relative to crypto
3139 2018-03-29 03:34:37 $kash is quite new to the market relative to the others. Different ball game. It missed out on the big run that blockchain stocks had for the most part, aside from private raises.

3144 2018-03-29 03:30:25 Bump stocks are garbage
3145 2018-03-29 03:30:10 And British greed had ruined British fish stocks well before Britain joined the then Common Market in 1973.
3146 2018-03-29 03:28:24 Reminiscent of 2000-01 when analysts just kept bumping tgts and the stocks just kept cratering.  Deja vu

3148 2018-03-29 03:27:27 Interesting, I'd expect a similar pattern for NZ. Influences might include the global economic climate affecting how people vote. I'd like to see a similar anaysis which included capital stocks, we've just discovered our 2nd biggest hosital is mouldy due to deferred maintenance
3149 2018-03-29 03:27:01 Russia loving NRA. Politician owning NRA. It's time your power is gone. Ban asualt weapons, bump stocks, 21 before purchasing a gun and a background checks that takes more than 5 minutes. Oh yeah, you're a hateful person. Very dislikable.
3150 2018-03-29 03:26:22 The ATF approved of bump stocks under Obama!  It was seen as an accessory and not an actual of part of a gun!
3151 2018-03-29 03:25:24 Explained some strategies and the reasoning and even why I believe in the stocks and ready for whatever games they give us tomorrow and beyond so they sleep better as well. It's under control, every aspect.

3159 2018-03-29 03:18:23 Lol and the best part is we don’t trade penny stocks and rarely stocks under $10
3160 2018-03-29 03:16:23 20-30 stocks in some I used to run.
3161 2018-03-29 03:15:38 GOP had chance ban bump stocks but tried trade banning for more guns in more places + blamed dems for not going for it. Exactly how would banning bump stocks "punish millions of law abiding citizens"? No gun now or ever already owned will be taken unless danger to self or others.
3162 2018-03-29 03:14:12 Can I suggest that remote diagnostics be suspended and ohhh… maintenance facilities might wanna hold off on installing any software updates for a few weeks. 

Ohh yeah, anyone know how to short airline stocks? Just askin for a friend. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
3163 2018-03-29 03:13:29 Let's be sensible and not go to extremes. Criminals and those intending to do harm WILL ALWAYS find weapons of some sort. It's our right to protect ourselves and our families. Just set better guidelines such as thorough background checks, age of 21, no Bump Stocks, etc.
3164 2018-03-29 03:13:10 I think bump stocks are silly... just a way to waste ammo... not effective for anything else. 
 Vetting/ keeping guns out of mentally compromised or known violent individuals makes sense... if done logically.
3165 2018-03-29 03:12:58 When reviewing a stocks chart, technical analysts consider 2 things?
3166 2018-03-29 03:12:42 Automatic Rifles, bump stocks & accessories that allow 17 dead 17 injured in < 6mn 20 seconds & Vegas, Pulse nightmares. I just want kids to be safe at school & come home in 1 piece, literally. Common sense laws, ability to go to events & school WO fear in USA That's all we want!
3167 2018-03-29 03:11:57 So when the sector rallies BlackBerry does not take part, but suddenly when the sector comes under pressure BlackBerry is suddenly part of it and the stocks suffer huge losses? That is corrupt Wall Street as we know it
3168 2018-03-29 03:10:02 Only 8 stocks in the Dow that are NOT in “correction” territory (yet). 
$NKE $TRV $V $MSFT $INTC $AAPL $GS $JPM
3169 2018-03-29 03:09:37 So much exuberance in these stocks dice analista en @BloombergTV I totally agree
3170 2018-03-29 03:08:23 I main Puff because it's super fun to play and taking stocks as Puff is satisfying as hell
3171 2018-03-29 03:07:05 So we have a Bradley with an assault rifle, not an armoured vehicle, multiple bump stocks just for kicks, multiple grenades because Bostonians love explosions? He’s got 3 parking tickets from Cambridge because he couldn’t get his analytica right?? That’s a mouthful of hot buttons
3172 2018-03-29 03:06:26 If bump stocks make semi automatic, automatic,should be banned. Las Vegas horrible,but action of disgusting criminal,should not be used as rationale to punish millions of law abiding citizens.

3176 2018-03-29 03:02:47 Whatever you do, do not ban bump stocks. It’s the foot in the door the anti-gun liberals want to start the ball rolling on #GunControl @GunOwners @NRA @DLoesch @MrColionNoir
3177 2018-03-29 03:02:08 I will be on Statewide Drive radio @ABCNSW today at 4.45pm to discuss markets and stocks.
3178 2018-03-29 03:01:54 Why did are you trying to ban bump stocks tho?
3179 2018-03-29 03:00:47 I’m buying stocks in @justinalmeida27 Warrior jersey sales for next season.
3180 2018-03-29 03:00:20 Looking over stocks wit pops & @MoneyyManJuan 
3181 2018-03-29 02:59:54 We don't need to repeal 2nd Amend We just need reasonable regulations to remove military-grade weapons designed for mass killing (i.e., bump stocks & semiautomatic rifles) out of the hands of ordinary citizens who don't need them for personal protection or hunting.

3183 2018-03-29 02:59:21 But, hey, I'm not pitching it to you as Investment. Haha. I've watched many traders make money on $OWCP. ;)
3184 2018-03-29 02:58:05 OWC a subpenny? They were subpenny from 9/12/16 to 9/30/16 & never again. That's because of a Note gone bad & it leading to a still pending lawsuit last I read. But, it's definitely been a screwy deal. Management as of June/July is a huge step up. Hirsch from $FOMX, for example.
3185 2018-03-29 02:56:59 I was talking about AR-15s used in recent mass school shootings. Yes, rifles count for small percent but 50 killed 400 + wounded in Los Vegas with rifles and bump stocks - victims wouldn't have been in range of handguns. AR-15s 3x more powerful than handguns and much more lethal.

-Universal Background Checks
-Waiting periods
-No Assault Style Rifles 
-No bump stocks 
-Increase Age for Purchase 
So many cowards!!!

3193 2018-03-29 02:53:41 NRA will never speak for me. Gun owner & CC in NY. I'm for sensible gun regulations, background checks, no gun show or private sales, waiting periods, ban high cap mags & bump stocks, permits for handguns, 5 rd max rifle mag, mandatory training, rules for storage. Nothing to hide
3194 2018-03-29 02:53:08 im not a fan of $OWCP. kind of hard to get behind a sub penny ticker.just cant wrap my head around it.i would rather play bigger tickers.but i'm not against trading OWCP if the chart lends itself 2 a trade. $CNBX not sure either i haven't been watching it lately. but good 2 known
3195 2018-03-29 02:52:54 Same here, bro.  Love those three stocks.  They're all innovative in their own way.  Accumulating here.

3211 2018-03-29 02:41:42 Yes and no w/ the ATF. On paper technically yes, but there are so many work around especially in super loose gun law states like LA, AL, FL. I agree no need 4 bump stocks, hell fire triggers, etc

3213 2018-03-29 02:40:21 First off, I love the pic...The Dude is great.  Let's be honest, one of girls making a speech at the March said "We got a inch with the ban of bump stocks, but we want the whole 12, we're not here for crumps." Crumbs is a direct quote from Pelosi, so I know who's leading this.

3218 2018-03-29 02:37:58 I don’t think any decent person is against stricter vetting to own a gun. I don’t think the guns themselves are the issue. I think the mods, bump stocks and extended and drum mags to name the biggest two are more the issue. But on the flip side is the mental health focus. I don’t
3219 2018-03-29 02:37:25 Semi auto = one bullet fired for every one pull of the trigger. They're not machine guns, 90% of the guns manufactured in the US are semi auto, including most revolvers. Bump stocks are novelty items, they provide no tactical advantage only fun burning through ammo.

3222 2018-03-29 02:35:05 Remody action is already done
I think its time to stop further conflict by unwanted discussions
Talk stocks pls
3223 2018-03-29 02:34:02 instead to protect retail there need to be alternate instruments like re introducing mini futures or allowing short sell of stocks, where qty is decided by the investor. plus implementation has a lot of challenge- what if i take leverage across multi brokers. (1/2)
3224 2018-03-29 02:33:45 Stocks are intangible.

3227 2018-03-29 02:32:04 #4 Markets need to reset - I want to see it happen, but like I said before - I trade what I see after the markets open. I have made very nice profits playing UVXY the past week (very nice profits) - If buyers show tomorrow on SPY, I will flip and go long certain stocks.

Bull case - Short squeeze (2600 HOLD) tomorrow to keep the quarter positive  target 2673+ 
Bear case - Technical break of trend lines on tech stocks ... drop to see 200 SMA & feb lows 
SUCKER case - Market makers pin 260 just like today ... CHOP CHOP .. 
3230 2018-03-29 02:31:11 To simply have Trump say no bump stocks when anyone who has fired a automatic weapon knows you don’t need a bump stock to bump fire a semi-automatic pistol or rifle is a ineffective give to get people off his and the NRA’s back.

3233 2018-03-29 02:26:55 @jimcramer - would it be smart to sell off bank stock now at a lost to turn and reinvest in discounted stocks like $CRM and $BABA? Much greater upside could offset current losses.
3234 2018-03-29 02:26:41 I appreciate your optimism, Ben, which is shared by the many energy consultants paid by Gazprom, but by none of the investors not buying Gazprom stocks for other reasons than high dividend yields. As long as Alexei Miller remains CEO nothing positive can happen in Gazprom.

3241 2018-03-29 02:23:39 This is from FoxBusiness and we should believe it? Actually those companies are buying back their stocks and making sure their stockholders get money, not their employees. As usual, @GOP is full of shit!

3244 2018-03-29 02:20:50 What if I told you every firearm accessory including a bump stick has to be reviewed by the ATF before being sold to the public and bump stocks have been approved do I believe they are right no not really but they have been approved by the ATF
3245 2018-03-29 02:20:30 I know it cracks me up, so brainwashed. It's their money too but they don't care. What about the 1.5 DEFICIT #traitortot Trump just helped created, next they will raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it. How's all that wining going. Stocks lost 10yrs of PROGRESS WTF?
3246 2018-03-29 02:20:03 tyler is not a swindler mate. he did analysis of 1000 of charts over 40 years of his work and found correlation amongst very few stocks and indexes  etc that have the same shape. a Hyperwave. easy to trade if you have a timemachine. hard when in it;)
3247 2018-03-29 02:19:19 As a gun owner & a hunter, I don’t need access to a semi-automatic pistol/rifle to defend myself effectively. Nor do i need stripper clips, high volume mags or bump stocks.
3248 2018-03-29 02:19:16 #1 Some are sure that the markets will bounce of the 200 ema - I keep an open mind and ask Why? More than 50% of all stocks are already below their 200ema and that number is climbing. World markets have all rolled over. Feds are selling paper and taking profits.
3249 2018-03-29 02:18:30 THERE IS A DOMESTIcE ViOLENCE BAN,whats the point of wait periods? bump stocks? you can use your finger and use the recoil to act like one,the ar15 is a outdated semi auto,nothing else is special,5 round mags  the cops are gonna force you in your house which is illegal
3250 2018-03-29 02:18:22 Tried to convince fam 100% stocks/bonds is bad.“Buy non corrollated assets” Won’t do it for fear of volatile assets.That fed put has worked for them for so long so far.
3251 2018-03-29 02:18:04 AR-15 and bump stocks give the same effect
3252 2018-03-29 02:16:43 Why is your dad against common sense gun control? 
-Background Checks
-3 day Waiting period 
-Physch Eval
-Gun safety classes
-Mandatory report of lost/stolen guns. 
-Banning Bump Stocks
-Banning intermediate rounds.

3257 2018-03-29 02:08:37 Good point. We generally do not consider the Nasdaq 100, given its less broad aspect. And to be super strict, the 18% fall from Dec 2015 to Feb 2016 still ain't 20%! That's still an "intermediate level correction." Scary good one, though $QQQ #stocks #trading #BearMarket
3258 2018-03-29 02:07:07 Quit fear mongering.... no one is asking for the repeal@of the second amendment. Ban bump stocks, ban assault rifles, close the gun show loop holes, strict back ground checks this is what Americans want not your #AlternativeFacts

3260 2018-03-29 02:06:18 The S&P/#ASX200 down 0.2% to 5,775 points. #Technology stocks led the decline following weakness in the same sector on the Nasdaq Composite last night.
3261 2018-03-29 02:04:49 I truly don't understand when ppl say we are now on the right track.During the last 8 years the economy has been on a steady rise, jobs &stocks. Actually trump created less jobs. Ppl forget that President Obama had to pull us out of the worst economy since the Great Depression

3289 2018-03-29 01:42:54 this mindset of "making big $$" is real problem in most small investors. truth/fact is most people never become rich playing stocks/options. that's simply reality. and 90%+ ppl lose $$ long term in stock mkt if they trade aggressively. if u can't change this mindset never succeed
3290 2018-03-29 01:40:03 Investing a single stock is putting all your eggs in one basket and nobody wants that. An index fund/etf is a collection of different stocks(baskets) that help diversify your portfolio(which is where yo saved money is) and protect it against losses.

3292 2018-03-29 01:38:57 Yeah, the small oil stocks are victims of over-investment
3293 2018-03-29 01:38:52 I’m not crying!  I have more money and my stocks have just increased for my retirement!
3294 2018-03-29 01:38:02 This is the image in my mind of AJ when the opening bell rings and the stocks play to whatever he says!
3295 2018-03-29 01:35:16 Who said anything about taking them away.  That's not what this is about.  It's about more rigorous background checks, no bump stocks, no automatic converters, mentally ill not allowed weapons.
3296 2018-03-29 01:34:29 The nice thing about doing all that yard work is that while out front, I have the scent of my jasmines and stocks in bloom, and out back, all of the little citrus trees in bloom! 
3297 2018-03-29 01:34:10 Okay. I respect that we also have differing opinions. So u would like to see automatic rifles and semi automatic rifles like the AR-15 become illegal?? As well as bump stocks??   And stricter background checks. What else would you like to see being done??  I'm just curious??
3298 2018-03-29 01:33:54 Work hard, play hard. Rinse and repeat and dreams will keep coming true. Congrats! 
Back to resource stocks.

3302 2018-03-29 01:31:28 The NERF-15 is highly effective against Soy Boys, Loony Liberals, and Deluded Democrats. Be sure to use the new and improved "Trump" Red Pills for ammo. Pelosi Butt Stocks sold separately.
3303 2018-03-29 01:30:44 Bump stocks absolutely- they turn a semi auto into a prohibited fully automatic weapon. I don’t support a ban on my AR... it’s one shot per trigger pull just like other semi auto guns. Looks menacing but operates the same.
3304 2018-03-29 01:30:21 Of course not! Most Americans, Lindsey, want background checks, limits on Assault rifles and bump stocks- many democrats own and shot guns just like republicans. Stop trying to make this political
3305 2018-03-29 01:29:21 These are buying opportunities. Stocks are on sale on these days. Everything is an opportunity!
3306 2018-03-29 01:27:15 You acting like you can’t pull money out of stocks
3307 2018-03-29 01:26:35 Sorry but it ain't going to happen just because the design looks like a military weapon doesn't mean it is, I can see that bump stocks might be banned, bump stocks you can turn a legal gun into an illegal automatic machine gun type rifle but a repeater hunting gun is semi-auto
3308 2018-03-29 01:25:50 I don’t trade options I follow a couple guys on twitter and have tried it and seems to risky for me I been trading stocks for awhile just trying to find a groove and a room that can guide me
3309 2018-03-29 01:25:42 And the fact that the market keeps moving lower, and most 401k are limited in the investment choices they provide you with. By getting it into your own IRA account you would get more control over what you want to invest in such as index ETF's or individual stocks.
3310 2018-03-29 01:25:14 Overnight -> USD heavily bid while stocks had a rough day. Several stories highlighted threat posed to the tech sector by Trump administration, which further shook confidence & FANG+. SPX -0.29%, Nasdaq -0.85%. U.S. yields lower. No significant news/data. #Nifty #Markets
3311 2018-03-29 01:23:40 Same here, Bump stocks are a novelty. No use but to waste ammo. 
3312 2018-03-29 01:23:29 Twitter stocks are booming up.
3313 2018-03-29 01:22:13 I use about 47m one issue after completion of DD, CR and release of JORC. As by then u can get a direct comparison against peers. I’d exclude scoping study and beyond related milestone stocks, as that’s yonks away. 47* $0.8=$38
3314 2018-03-29 01:21:49 @realDonaldTrump  I was for banding bump stocks until I read how it was defined... it was defined in a way that would end up banding all semi automatic fire arms .... DO NOT VOTE FOR THIS
3315 2018-03-29 01:20:58 I wish tech stocks were volatile, that implies that they go down and back up!
3316 2018-03-29 01:20:26 101st Airborne Vet, what exact freedom are you fighting for? 2FA?

Nothing prevents you from "bearing arms" but military style weapons, bump stocks and large magazines should not be available to the general public. 

Look at the Swiss, they it right. #VetsResistSquadron
3317 2018-03-29 01:20:25 So you support ban on high capacity magazines? Bump stocks? If so, this makes you a lot less "conservative" than those this tweet is aimed at.
3318 2018-03-29 01:19:02 Both stocks sold!

3321 2018-03-29 01:16:27 No matter how many guns you stockpile or bump stocks or extended clips you accessorize your arsenal with, the government is still going to split your wig if properly motivated. 
(Continued)
3322 2018-03-29 01:15:16 Yes, that’s weird. I realize this is far from a money manager having general permission to trade stocks and then quietly buying Exxon.
3323 2018-03-29 01:14:59 Nobody, INCLUDING DEMOCRATS, seeks to repeal the 2nd Amendment moron!!!  What MANY of us are asking is for a ban on military style assault rifles, bump stocks, and high cap mags. Stricter background checks and a nat’l gun registry would be good too. 

SCOTUS Op Ed author is a REP
3324 2018-03-29 01:13:02 Buy stocks????
3325 2018-03-29 01:12:21 I have like 70k to make back from stocks and cryptos  and that’s for personal accounts. Myfidelity I have 15k to go back to my high and was down 45k made 30k back last 3 mth.  But no giving up
3326 2018-03-29 01:11:25 I totally agree, it’s all a scam they are too busy tweeting that just says everything. #twitterfingers they are just hyping there company through stocks to feed them money. Good luck AMLH I’m out.
3327 2018-03-29 01:10:44 So the average investor who may have been able to invest in 10 retail/consumer staple stocks, now have to look to a FEW Behemoths that the UBER Rich have cornered the market on..The Fang Stocks...Lead by AMAZON! Income Inequality ENHANCED! @cvpayne
3328 2018-03-29 01:09:44 i dont use Google spy net work and if twitter gos more dirt twitter stocks well fall like facebooks and people well still live on with out them lol
3329 2018-03-29 01:09:17 If you haven’t, google Jim Jeffries gun control. Just how stupid of a debate this truly is. No one needs an AR15, or bump stocks, or high capacity magazines. Good for Pop to speak his mind. Just like all of us are doing now. Or have we forgotten the 1st amendment?Give him a break
3330 2018-03-29 01:09:12 Oh, I think that’s reading into a POA. They don’t necessitate relinquishing control. Just adding an alternative decision maker. (Think of a money manager empowered to trade a client’s stocks without consultation or even prior notification.)
3331 2018-03-29 01:08:20 All of those guns are semi automatic. All those guns can be turned into rifles with elongated barrels and stocks, just look at an uzi.

3337 2018-03-29 01:03:39 I'd rather try to save all lives,keep all guns away kids under 21, semi automatics away from all, better background checks, better restraining orders, limits on magazine sizes and no bump stocks.
3338 2018-03-29 01:03:28 Stocks ain’t no joke, keep moving lowkey niggas don’t need to know about ya pockets fr
3339 2018-03-29 01:03:27 Bump stocks, for sure. Illegal to possess. Semi-automatic weapons are also banned, including the AR-15 and all models of AK. Silencers too. Sounds like pretty much most of what they brought into the state, really.
3340 2018-03-29 01:03:19 #Stocks,#Indexes Only then can the full meaning of a top signal be deduced.

3344 2018-03-29 00:59:30 @GOP You're about to get a really bad message. Here's a preview. The tax reform plan is a complete bust, the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, the stock market is down because of tech stocks, & Trump attacked Amazon. Americans vote their pocketbooks! You deserve it.
3345 2018-03-29 00:59:25 completely redid all of my bills, due dates, budget spreadsheet, and stocks/portfolio before my new job starts. feels like a weight’s been lifted.

3347 2018-03-29 00:58:31 Who cares? Nobody says the tommy gun laws are unconstitutional. Why wd the 2nd A get in the way of a ban on bump stocks?

3349 2018-03-29 00:57:57 You should get a full-time job at ASIC, but then we'd probably have half the stocks to trade. 
3350 2018-03-29 00:57:22 research was many years. definitely are ways to use data for stocks.
3351 2018-03-29 00:57:19 #Stocks,#Indexes OK, I went from suggesting the 26 Mar. signal signaled "limited declines" (27 Mar.) to later labeling it "MAJOR", signaling substantial decline, if not immediately.  Top signals are complex and require comparing each with all of its recent predecessors...
3352 2018-03-29 00:57:05 I agree... that's why we - the adults in the room - must pass and enforce stricter gun laws. That means AR15s & all other assault-style rifles OFF THE STREETS, no bump stocks or other devices that create an assault-style fire arm, and stricter background checks. Make sense?
3353 2018-03-29 00:56:51 Hogwash. The Mini-14 is a thinly disguised assault rifle. Just like the AR-type rifles, a selective fire version was marketed for military and law enforcement. There are also different guards & stocks that make it look "more scary" but are also designed that way for a reason.
3354 2018-03-29 00:55:28 @SethS_D loved the book!! The conclusion was great. 2 questions & 1 comment did it really take 6months to write it? how long did it take you to learn how to analyze the data? & I really think there would be some way to use this thinking for stocks

3359 2018-03-29 00:51:54 99% of Americans are on board with positive change that will save lives. My fear (and millions of others fear) is that the government took our “crumbs (bump stocks) but now we want the whole mile”. What does that mean to you?
3360 2018-03-29 00:51:52 Only with those that suffer from TDS
3361 2018-03-29 00:49:59 On July 17, 1996, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
filed a complaint against a number of firms that act as market makers in Nasdaq
stocks. The complaint basically alleged that a common understanding arose among
3362 2018-03-29 00:49:56 Nasdaq market makers which worked to keep quote spreads in Nasdaq stocks
artificially wide.
3363 2018-03-29 00:49:39 hold on to those stocks

3365 2018-03-29 00:48:09 50 Miles More movement demands ban of:
•Military-style weapons & all weapons of war
•Bump stocks & similar accessories
•4 day waiting period on all gun purchases.
•Require background checks on all gun sales.
•Raise the legal purchasing age of all guns to 21
3366 2018-03-29 00:47:03 Exactly so, bump-stocks fire at an irregular rate as belt fed is consistent then speeds up as belt grows short. Tell me has anyone seen a single picture of spent casings?  Why?

3373 2018-03-29 00:44:46 Not sure why target stocks the archer farms salads if they’re just gonna continually be on sale for $3 compared to $6, but I won’t complain
3374 2018-03-29 00:44:29 The ONLY positive thing that can come from the #Parkland murders is if it results in Congress getting off of their butts to ban bump stocks, change the age to buy guns to 21, close all gun show loopholes AND no more selling of assault-type weaponry. That's for the military.
3375 2018-03-29 00:44:16 Having read the 55-page document, though it repeatedly refers to bump stocks, it also mentions triggers and seeks to change "single function" to "single pull." This means binary triggers are also included with this. Parlaying with our rights will only lead to more infringement.
3376 2018-03-29 00:43:33 It's really irresponsible and shitty to make up and spread rumors/fear of problems with the gene therapy while trials are going on and no information came out to support such a claim.  Stocks go up and down all the time for various and for no reasons. Speculation pointless.

3378 2018-03-29 00:42:53 Finally bought some stocks but I’m madddd nervous
3379 2018-03-29 00:39:37 President Trump did write an order to have bump stocks to be illegal. I'm not trying to be argumentative with you, but I feel that this is a multifaceted issue. Not just a gun issue. Yes, I believe that stricter gun laws should happen, but shouldn't affect law abiding citizen.
3380 2018-03-29 00:39:01 all i have is my feelings....i feel the rout on stocks is done....dow 30k next stop....
3381 2018-03-29 00:38:45 +$200 trillion tied up in cash, stocks, bonds & gold all over-valued.
If just 2% ends up in crypto we'd hit a $4 trillion valuation.
This $4 trillion figure is conservative & well < the current value of the gold market even though we don't know how much gold there is in the

3383 2018-03-29 00:37:42 I was a holdout about supporting corporations, be the healthcare industry I am in is seriously screwing over people. I hate to say it, but they will do anything to wring a few more dollars out of us. Cutting benefits, 401k matches... but are buying back stocks.
3384 2018-03-29 00:37:17 After the Bell: An Awful March for Stocks Is Almost Over. Too Bad It Might Not Get Much Better. Barron’s has thrown in the towel - 2nd qtr worse and mid term elections vote in the opposition party. 278 days sure went fast Chris
3385 2018-03-29 00:36:54 #trading #RandomThoughts 

I feel without a proper stock lending & borrowing system and now sebi reducing the number of stocks in f&o gradually, more & more stocks will trade at bloated valuations! 

Only when shorting is enabled in a stock, true price discovery happens!
3386 2018-03-29 00:35:56 Their stocks,are already  going down!
3387 2018-03-29 00:35:33 Even us stocks are highly promoted. U need a promo to get word the out. Now if they were negligence then yes I see a problem here. But I don't the mmj falls in that place. Other compaines there I  would name 3 of them absolutely  everything they said didn't happen

3391 2018-03-29 00:32:31 Stocks are going to tank on that note...and when Rice and Obama are thrown in prison, they will be bankrupt...IF it takes that long. #DitchNetflix
3392 2018-03-29 00:31:19 I'm not a zealot and I do believe we can keep our 2nd amendment right and still ban bump stocks, high capacity clips and military style weapons. We have done it before and not lost our right to own guns. I do believe the right to life trumps right to gun.
3393 2018-03-29 00:31:02 After much campaigning( occasionally mentioning it to whoever's in there) the shop near my work now stocks wispa golds.

Don't just wait for change, make the change happen guys
3394 2018-03-29 00:30:24 Learned my lesson with stocks during GFC back in 2008. Missed out the gain in the past 10 years. This is like a second chance to me. I am going to hodl and look for more opportunities in this bear market. Hope everybody else sees the opportunities too.
3395 2018-03-29 00:28:58 Ok, say the AR15 are banned and destroyed, bump stocks are gone, All magazines are under 10 rounds. What is the plan when someone uses a Winchester 1894 or a pump action shotgun and create the same carnage?
3396 2018-03-29 00:28:50 u stole the layer styles from another pack. Exclusive lights nothing. Stocks... Simple
3397 2018-03-29 00:28:48 That's why I don't understand how analysts upgraded all these stocks on January on tax reform if they still don't know exactly how it will play out. Very irresponsible and sloppy. We might have seen the top.
3398 2018-03-29 00:28:22 BUMP AND GRIND! Trump sacrifices a mere PAWN and lets the GUN GRABBERS think they TRIUMPHED by banning bump stocks. THE ART OF THE DEAL!

3401 2018-03-29 00:25:47 Shorter, lightweight, high-powered  rifles that fire with each trigger pull. Full-auto meaning continuous fire with a held trigger and mods that approximate such like bump stocks and cranks.

Prior commitment to a mental health facility. Diagnosis of severe psych disorder.
3402 2018-03-29 00:25:40 I think I saw a news item this afternoon saying Tesla stock is a mess just now. Too bad, I hope one day to invest in driverless car stocks.
3403 2018-03-29 00:24:48 Maybe you forgot about the three strikes bill put in place by B Clinton, putting an additional 3/4 of black males in prison. Oh right but his wife probably stocks their cells with hot sauce. 
3404 2018-03-29 00:24:19 TL;DR: SHORT the stocks & LONG crypto! Thank you for this amazing article.
3405 2018-03-29 00:23:54 Fully automatics are banned and have been for a long time. 
Fully automatic lets you  hold the trigger and it keeps firing until empty
Simi-Auto fires as fast as you pull trigger. 
Bump stocks lets a simi auto fire nearly as fast as a full.
3406 2018-03-29 00:23:49 me swirling my wine glass: stocks? I have hundreds
3407 2018-03-29 00:21:35 @TuckerCarlson The President gave the anti-gunners ammunition when he famously taunted Toomey & Manchin to stand up to the NRA. Then he followed up by banning bump stocks. Don't be surprised if the next Dem president is emboldened to ban certain guns & ammo.
3408 2018-03-29 00:21:01 I think I’ll sell my stocks now.
3409 2018-03-29 00:20:52 Je pense que les stocks français pis ceux américain sont pas les mêmes !
3410 2018-03-29 00:20:48 I agree. Bump stocks should be banned. It’s just that automatic rifles shouldn’t be banned. There should be no need for a slide fire buttstock.
3411 2018-03-29 00:20:44 True life I’m obsessed with trading stocks like it’s a fun game to me and it’s definitely not healthy b/c of my questionable comprehension of the stock market and also the fact that I forget it’s my real money whoops

3413 2018-03-29 00:18:31 great. Can we start by throwing his whole Administration into the stocks?

they trade like stocks, retail account will line up for that offering
3415 2018-03-29 00:18:19 It's not a huge change at all. Beer comes in GLASS bottles as does wine..Paper card etc is widely produced....that's a red herring with that rubbish of it being a huge change..It's a loss of income for those who hold stocks in plastic..That's the only change.
3416 2018-03-29 00:17:48 @YahooFinance how often is your statistical data updated on stocks? Most importantly the shares outstnading, float and short ratio.
3417 2018-03-29 00:17:19 3 free stocks
3418 2018-03-29 00:14:51 Stocks that’s aren’t getting promoted by “you know who” yet have the potential to do well AND have a good chart. In the end it’s all a gamble and primarily about risk management, though.
3419 2018-03-29 00:13:28 maybe I could get a few :o
I know nanotanks in Silverwater often stocks them but they're otherwise hard to find
3420 2018-03-29 00:12:52 Great entry here, I loaded up
3421 2018-03-29 00:11:40 While gasoline is expected to, its Gasoil that'll move. Last week: Brent unch, WTI -1%, Gasoline -1%, Gasoil +1%. Weather happened. US will produce more Gasoline and Europe will refiner more to replenish Gasoil stocks. With lower Gasoline demand. #oott
3422 2018-03-29 00:08:28 A question: since bump stocks and high capacity mags are not an original part of a gun and do nothing to prevent the gun from operating, why do we even SUPPOSE that these add-ons are covered by 2nd Amendment?
3423 2018-03-29 00:07:57 NFLX is probably the one stock that taught me that I was not a trader, nor suitable for high growth stocks....I bought at $9.48 in 2005....wait for it...bailed when I doubled my money a few months later.
3424 2018-03-29 00:07:05 from.buying stocks that move fastest to buying stocks that bet on fasting - we have come a long way down.
3425 2018-03-29 00:06:15 Who took the photo? Lol
3426 2018-03-29 00:06:12 If you support Trump, you cannot say you are for 2nd Amendment rights. Trump is just about to ban bump-stocks and has proposed four other unconstitutional gun control measures!
3427 2018-03-29 00:04:38 good luck to me for having 4 hours of sleep with a full shift and 800 pieces of stocks 
3428 2018-03-29 00:04:08 Corporations were already profitable. We are borrowing money and increasing the deficit so they could give executives bonuses and buy back stocks. We did not have the money to give them, it's borrowed.

3431 2018-03-29 00:02:48 I agree 100%.  We are in an ownership society. Don’t need to own biz but own something.  Can’t just be an employee.  At very least, own stocks for long term

3436 2018-03-29 00:00:19 2A rights have limits.  Common sense laws can protect all Americans but especially our law enforcement officers who are outgunned.  Outlaw AR-15s, bump stocks and cop killer bullets, require universal background checks and pass red flag laws. #TownHallForOurLives #NeverAgain
3437 2018-03-29 00:00:19 Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note Monday that its clients bought the dip seen last week. "Big net buys of US single stocks plus small inflows into ETFs led to total net buys of $3.0bn," the note said.   so how did ML get this information?   what clients?
