1 2018-10-09 23:59:41 @matpatgt @cordypatrick don't worry, it's not you. As a 15 yr oil painter, you need linseed oil and better canvases to get good blending! Also I learned not to do a "thin" background, but instead mix colors with titanium white and lay that stuff on! Then it blends well! #gtlive

43 2018-10-09 23:55:52 #GTlive sorry Chris and Jason but we're not trying to hate on you guys we just simply want to inform you that when you use oil paints you need paint thinner, the fact that you guys aren't is making it hard for them to paint. Like the first step that Bob did.

52 2018-10-09 23:54:42 We've never been subsidised by you, that's the whole thing. It's a myth, a fantasy. Scotland's oil has kept the UK Exchequer afloat for over 30 years. Scotland found oil and got poorer. It's obscene that we have food banks and starving kids.
53 2018-10-09 23:54:35 You can’t water down oil though. So he’s not using oil. And even if they had acrylics, I doubt they’d paint that streaky.

Why would a nonpartisan body put something like this forward if we shouldn’t take heed? I just want you to realize this is only partisan due to the Koch oil $.
55 2018-10-09 23:54:31 Bacon, cheeses, coconut oil, olive oil, avocados are major, nuts in moderation(they have too many carbs to eat too many of), eggs, ranch & blue cheese salad dressing are packed w fat, heavy cream in coffee, hamburger, fatty meats, sautéed veggies w lots of the above oils, olives

Not enough info on how..just statements
60 2018-10-09 23:53:42 Ok, no new taxes. How about no subsidies for oil, pipelines and private vehicles and the roads they use. All these subsidies raised from taxes. Taxes bad!!!

65 2018-10-09 23:53:04 What I find interesting is oil has gone from $67 to $75 per barrel under Republicans.  Gas pump prices rising.
66 2018-10-09 23:53:03 I dont understand how so many food places fry fish, chicken and vegetables products in the same oil.. 

And im no expert but imo that's not appropriate kitchen/ food protocol..

1. Its gross and unsanitary 
2. People have allergies
3. You lazy motherf****rs

71 2018-10-09 23:52:44 Frankly I’m glad to see the IPCC throwing some heat with its report. Earlier this year at a climate hearing activists talked about the IPCC as one shade better than denialists (in part because the oil companies are finally saying “okay maybe the most conservative scenario”) 1/2

74 2018-10-09 23:52:20 With higher concentration of ethanol year round... the lifting will be opposed by oil refiners... 10% ethanol, but benefit farmers... it will allow them more avenues to ell corn, bolster revenue especially with presidential reform...

89 2018-10-09 23:50:19 Except Nikola's trucks are still vapourware and sources of hydrogen are only 4% electrolysis which is is an energy inefficient process as the rest 86% is fossil fuels, including natural gas, coal and oil, which we need to move away from.
90 2018-10-09 23:50:08 #GTlive Chris , paint thinner is necessary for oil paint though , it might be part of choice but, it doesn't work that way for oil , you need it ;-;
91 2018-10-09 23:50:07 Put it back on the stove. Add salt, garlic, olive oil, rice or pasta, and chase it with a beer. You're good to go. Get well, soon.

Taking back control -- of us.

133 2018-10-09 23:45:33 Exactly. We give money to farmers and oil companies. Let them learn a new trade like Obama said coal miners bill. Like GI Bill
Repugs said it cost too  much. Trump  told them he would bring back the killer coal mines with no decent health care. Voted for him. Education folks

141 2018-10-09 23:44:52 Preach! He's a snake oil salesmen.
142 2018-10-09 23:44:40 It’s funny they complain about climate change yet I’m pretty sure with the technology we have today we can make solor powered cars I mean there is solor powered house hmmmm this has to have something to do with how much the government is making off of oil
143 2018-10-09 23:44:38 ชอบเสื้อตัวนี้มากกกก
144 2018-10-09 23:44:36 Actually not what that says.
Thanks for posting the proof that refutes your own statement
145 2018-10-09 23:44:29 Just wait until you get a task to go fetch some oil 
146 2018-10-09 23:44:16 Do I know anyone in recovery who uses CBD oil? I am trying it for my arthritis and it tastes, well, like weed. Which was never my thing and I never particularly liked, but it’s a bit jarring.
147 2018-10-09 23:43:25 Everyone chase money all day but they sad when they see oil getting dumped in the ocean too. 

“What does one have to do with another” lol.
148 2018-10-09 23:43:23 Saudis flew the planes into the twin towers.  Oil is more important to us than lives

150 2018-10-09 23:43:13 pasaring yung walang oil para ma open yung explo with bff china niya!
151 2018-10-09 23:42:54 What about the oil and gas industry, when are you going to stand up for it, its hard workers and those who want to get back to work?
152 2018-10-09 23:42:34 100 Oil is not healthy, hope it stays in this 72 to 75 range for long time...
153 2018-10-09 23:42:33 And you can send your warriors to defend what exactly? Oil is past the sell by date according to the SNP or do you believe in the fiction of AS?
154 2018-10-09 23:42:30 Jojoba oil!
155 2018-10-09 23:42:26 First night with my new oil diffuser on and I am loving calming lavender to help me sleep  excited to test more scents v soon

160 2018-10-09 23:40:57 Yea, let's expand our horizons even further while our own house is leaking and falling down. Bernie is a rich white old patriarchal man, using lib labels, that has conned a great many ppl. Sad
161 2018-10-09 23:40:48 Your head get oil
I think say na only me taste am
162 2018-10-09 23:40:29 Purge our environment of oil, gas, coal, fracking, and other forms of dirty energy, and assure the dirty energy industry never rises from its miserable ashes.
163 2018-10-09 23:40:28 So #Trump will bring back #coal and advocate for #oil and push #ethanol? Yeah right.
164 2018-10-09 23:40:27 魂の収穫ナーフやったー

167 2018-10-09 23:40:14 I use coconut oil, rose water, and aloe literally for anything
168 2018-10-09 23:39:48 My mom is insisting I should take CBD oil lmao
169 2018-10-09 23:39:47 Don’t you know whose idea the tax breaks was? Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on oil companies when prices plummeted. You don’t know much, do you?
170 2018-10-09 23:39:38 You missed point no 5. Discounted price. I wish the crude oil price is going down to $65. I would like to see how much they sell with hide and seek trick :))
171 2018-10-09 23:39:38 His plan is your plan, McKenna. No one is buying this illusion of opposition. LibCons set targets, sign treaties we never respect, & tax the public. After, they shower the oil & pipeline companies with taxpayer funded subsidies & buy-outs. Corrupt elites all of ya. #cdnpoli
172 2018-10-09 23:39:30 considering the marriage slump that’s on this oil age and pulexes three shillings a pint and wives at six and seven when domestic calamitie

176 2018-10-09 23:38:51 Of course! think it was just trying to make a point though. Some bread has fish oil in too! for omega! Yuk who wants fishy bread! x

178 2018-10-09 23:38:46 If oil production was socially owned/controlled it seems to me we'd have less motivation to fight global warming, since oil's dividends would be spread to a greater number of people.
179 2018-10-09 23:38:36 When I think Saute, I think of cooking  in a pan with butter/oil and moving it around semi-constantly.  Kinda like making stir fry.  When I think grill, theres no oil or anything like that added and it just sits there over a heat source other than flipping it once or twice.
180 2018-10-09 23:38:28 I’ve never heard of an oil company lobbying against public transit. 
Ever.
181 2018-10-09 23:37:38 For shiny and healthy hair, mash an avocado, and a tablespoon of olive oil, and rub it through your hair. Wash your hair after 15 minutes

184 2018-10-09 23:37:17 I thought olive oil is higher in omega 6?
185 2018-10-09 23:37:09 Canada imports oil from the middle east that is a known fact.
186 2018-10-09 23:37:05 It's oil paint, adding water would ruin it. They need paint thinner for it. It appears as though Chris either forgot/didn't know that part of painting with oils.
187 2018-10-09 23:36:52 I just bought a cool new Poo-Chi robot dog!  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal! Who will win the War 4 Water!
188 2018-10-09 23:36:45 Sigh, and market is helping them to push up the price. Ridiculous #oil price #oversupply #glut
189 2018-10-09 23:36:42 It was for transmission service. Their oil change is the same price and it comes with a car wash. Thanks, but no thanks.

 1. Oil paint 
2. Paint thinner
3. Prime the canvas (paint it fully white before starting)
191 2018-10-09 23:36:16 Before it's current predicament, US attempted intervention has occurred continuously leading up to the current situation; funny how that happens when Venezuela biggest world oil reserving country though eh 
192 2018-10-09 23:36:11 How does anyone even mention you and him in the same breath?!  That's like, "Rasputin and Marie Curie are both selling snake oil and making money off of it."
193 2018-10-09 23:35:32 More evidence that corn oil is bad.

197 2018-10-09 23:34:45 how the fuck does the trash end up in the ocean in the first place I understand oil spills and fossil fuels but I dont get how straws travel from landfills to the ocean
198 2018-10-09 23:34:39 Gunna need some oil and balsamic with mine.
199 2018-10-09 23:34:15 That’s an example. Is there really an school that isn’t student centered? Education is replete with jargon and rebranding. I don’t think it’s snake oil but I do think we’re in danger of forgetting the debates of the past. 1/2
200 2018-10-09 23:34:12 I'm good with what I have Bernie, and no I'm not rich. 
You are doing a tremendous disservice to people that believe your nonsense.They should get in the game, make own way, and forget this bs. You are a threat to civil society period.
201 2018-10-09 23:34:04 The Middle East is still a shit hole. It’s the dark ages out there no matter how much oil they have. Point proven though.
202 2018-10-09 23:34:03 Change your own oil
203 2018-10-09 23:34:00 I only wear concealer because I have trash skin; and pressed powder to set the concealer and soak up the oil.
204 2018-10-09 23:33:59 I was thinking earlier. If vegetable oil is made of vegetables. Corn oil is made of corn. What is baby oil made of? @like
205 2018-10-09 23:33:55 @MatPatGT Chris, are you sure that you bought oil paints? Looks a bit like acrylic paint and seems to dry as fast as acrylic too! #GTLive

207 2018-10-09 23:33:49 Two slices of pizza are the equivalent to swallowing 3 spoons of warm oil. Do you feel like eating pizza now?
208 2018-10-09 23:33:39 Lavender essential oil is necessary
209 2018-10-09 23:33:39 Called the dealership to tell them the genie lamp light had come on in the car and they scheduled an oil change. Kind of disappointed it wasn't something more exciting.
210 2018-10-09 23:33:38 Yes PUTINS ROSNEF OIL! TRUMP MUST DELIVER to his BOSS
211 2018-10-09 23:33:37 I’m so sorry you have to deal with this. The only bright side of the trump era for me is the realization I have a great family. None voted for him and all see him as the snake oil salesman he is.
212 2018-10-09 23:33:31 I don’t. But I  usually use the lemongrass coconut body oil after.
213 2018-10-09 23:33:08 Im using my IMAGINATIOOON to pretend that Obama doest lie,Sarah Palin has a brain,the Kardashians arent sluts &amp; the oil spill isnt happening

220 2018-10-09 23:32:04 Welcome to SB! Lot of activist history:  GOO (Get Oil Out) from major oil spill; then IV riots over the Chicago Five being banned & Vietnam War issues.  I was here then, watched BofA burn down; re-living that feeling of "my country is on the wrong path" now.

222 2018-10-09 23:31:47 Mine owners, like Blankenship, think they can hold back history to increase their wealth, so that's their priority,  and they've been very successful, with Republican administrations.

Oil & gas guys like Tillerson have the same priorities as coal owners: to hold back history.
223 2018-10-09 23:31:17 Thank you, senator. @SenCoryGardner are you listening, or are you too busy begging oil, gas, and coal companies for @NRSC donations because "the science is still out on climate change"?
224 2018-10-09 23:31:16 I think earlier, one of them said it was oil paints. x_x
225 2018-10-09 23:31:11 I almost want to block that girl with the homemade dildo so I don't see it anymore. The yellow nails, tissue paper in a condom and baby oil all together just makes me feel ill...... And I tend to have a VERY open mind. Just get a cucumber baby.

227 2018-10-09 23:30:57 They are swindlers. No better than "Doctor" talk shows pushing snake oil. 

"Tried and tested for thousands of years" but proven not to be effective.
228 2018-10-09 23:30:55 I think Trump's waiting for the climate change report written by the oil and gas industry. Of course there's also the clean coal point of view to consider.

231 2018-10-09 23:30:05 i think there are a few of big issues here. first it’s simply not as fun for media people to write about non tech CEOs. secondly, many of these are national/quasinational corps in places where speaking up shortens your life span. third, apparently oil ind. has been fully explored

236 2018-10-09 23:29:41 So you’re a snake oil salesman like your pal, Drumpf? How’s that working for you? That degree from Drumpf U finally paying off!
237 2018-10-09 23:29:36 Clinton actually did rape.   Kavanaugh did not!
238 2018-10-09 23:29:35 Funny how Alberta told Ottawa to keep their noses out of their business for years and years when oil was booming. Now when the oil biz is down, it’s “wah...what about us?”
239 2018-10-09 23:29:31 Yes! I use the one with olive oil it never flakes on me even when i slick it back .
240 2018-10-09 23:29:11 #GTlive @chriswidin You need paint thinner for oil paints. Otherwise it's too thick for the canvas. Chris, check the chat!
241 2018-10-09 23:29:07 I’m 99% sure it’s oil. It looks like the tubes we had in art class. Oh goodness why...
242 2018-10-09 23:29:04 #GTlive @CordyPatrick @MatPatGT Watching you guys use oil paints without paint thinner is the most painful thing I’ve ever seen.
243 2018-10-09 23:29:04 They don't actually want those residents to vote in North Dakota. They are mostly oil workers and others new to the area and have different interests in local elections than long term residents, and some would rather they voted in Oregon or Wyoming or not at all.
244 2018-10-09 23:28:44 Eeee~ I’ve been wanting to do a drawing with red hands for awhile now~ I want to try an oil painting with one next  I LOVE YOU SWEETIENESS

246 2018-10-09 23:28:39 Nice try
247 2018-10-09 23:28:38 That forex situation was a time bomb bound to explode. The economy was practically grounded when oil prices were at an all time high.
248 2018-10-09 23:28:26 You should probably oil wrestle Ruth Bader Ginsburg...better ratings... better chance of winning....and another opportunity for Trump to nominate another  Supreme Court Justice.

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
250 2018-10-09 23:28:19 Good luck on it.  Both their light & heavy oil divisions sold for significantly less then Q2 (worse so far in Q4), they added $40 million in debt, issued more shares, and are still a small cap.  Back to Q2 '17 pricing when the stock was $0.70.  Need improved diffs, fast.
251 2018-10-09 23:28:14 Oil sands need to be scaled back over the next decade.  Selfish and extremely shortsighted to do otherwise.  Albertans will balk at this ... need to be given green energy alternatives.  Climate change disaster is imminent and our window to address it is closing.
252 2018-10-09 23:28:04 Mr Killa- Oil it up 
253 2018-10-09 23:27:59 Hey @CordyPatrick and @MatPatGT,
LET THE RECORD SHOW THAT TWITTER FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS WRONG WITH YOUR PAINT. 

Oil paints do not dry, they need turpentine, and they can’t be washed out of brushes with water. They don’t spread well on their own either.

We are sorry.

#GTLive
254 2018-10-09 23:27:42 I hope the oil change techs were intimidated by my knife that's casually sitting on my console
255 2018-10-09 23:27:35 Everywhere you go, with rubber gloves and a bottle of Wesson oil... LOL
256 2018-10-09 23:27:28 You have undermined any attempt to fix it. 
It's either 30 trillion for universal care or just idle in place with a law that only works for a tiny minority no matter how deserving they may be. Youre perpetrating a politically motivated fraud
257 2018-10-09 23:27:25 however again it seems that any oil f the four horsewomen will not be in the main event again. wwe purs you down - all 4 need to act and maje it your own
258 2018-10-09 23:27:22 “Duterte says lack of oil drives inflation...”, was a mind-conditioning approach in advance to let proceed with China-agreed joint oil exploration at WPS!

Hoi Dgong....learn not to do business with China! 
259 2018-10-09 23:27:19 Peppermint oil tends to help! As well as a dark room, no noise and a nice nap!
260 2018-10-09 23:27:00 “these two or three scientists the oil companies paid to speak about climate change being a hoax are surely on the level. The Left is promoting this hoax for _________ unfathomable reasons. must be Just Crazy!”
261 2018-10-09 23:26:51 I'm losing my mind. My girlfriend has this oil diffuser and puts lavender scented oil in it. It smells exactly like the lavender kitty litter the janitors used in elementary school to put on top of kids puke
262 2018-10-09 23:26:49 No i get free oil changes and y'all fucked me over last time
263 2018-10-09 23:26:48 Y'all.
If i mistakenly pour diesel oil in my petrol engine and try to start it, will it work?
264 2018-10-09 23:26:32 Lavender oil on my pillow before bed always helps me relax and drift off  x
265 2018-10-09 23:26:31 I did not go get my oil change. Like I don't wanna spend on that.but I gotss to soon

269 2018-10-09 23:26:06 But Skeletor, when your party imposes ridiculous regulations and kills the US oil and gas business, you force us to be dependent upon the Middle East.  

The US needs to stay out!
270 2018-10-09 23:25:54 First of all baby oil gonna make that shit bust and ruin ya pussy. 
271 2018-10-09 23:25:50 But the gov't is doing plenty about it. There chem trailing the sky, removing EPA regulation, drilling for oil in the most suseptible reagons of the world.

What more can they do? Kill all the people responsible for all this pollution? Hmm, now that would be a start!
272 2018-10-09 23:25:48 @stephenharper so U came out hiding to promote UR book with Ur usual propganda id U address how U balanced the budget by stealing $1B from the Vets Fund & increasing National Debt by $150B doing nothing on pipelines resulting in continued imports of 56% on NON CANADIAN oil.....
273 2018-10-09 23:25:44 Well, my island is well protected by Army, Navy and police because of the oil rigs and stuff. My hometown (Yucatán) has always been the safest place in Mexico (because we don't hang around with the rest of the country ).
274 2018-10-09 23:25:42 isn’t a profitable solution to curbing climate change the only functional method of doing so under capitalism? why would making money to prevent climate change damn their claims, but somehow oil companies etc. making money from pollution does not?
275 2018-10-09 23:25:35 First my headlight goes out, then i need an oil change, next I get a flat tire, and now I have a crack across my whole windshield. How fucking great
276 2018-10-09 23:25:28 Why are all these shampoos for adding oil to your hair. I need something that stops the shit not makes it more powerful.
277 2018-10-09 23:25:27 Given the new and alarming report on climate change ... will the Liberal government admit that Canada needs to chart a path to reducing oil sands production over the next decade ... reducing LNG production?  Will you lead on climate finally?
278 2018-10-09 23:25:24 So happy that my lashes are finally long that castor oil really works

General tips:
-wash new brushes to unstiffen the bristles
-put a lot of paint on the brush
-white lightens, complementary color mutens
Tip if acrylic:
-Mix it with white to thin out
If it's oil:
-Someone siad to mix it with paint thinner
280 2018-10-09 23:25:04 Lamp oil
281 2018-10-09 23:24:59 It’s like my dealership just knows when I need a oil change. Them damn coupons come in the mail like clockwork.

284 2018-10-09 23:24:44 If they don't listen to the heads of the Oil companies the oil will run out and the Politicians will lose money because their shares will be worthless! Climate,Vegetation waste oxygen and the earths heated core all combine to create oil. No oil no cash!
285 2018-10-09 23:24:37 You’re such a joke. Snake oil salesmen. Your fall will be epic.
286 2018-10-09 23:24:29 Not to mention all the money private individuals/corporations are making from the war (oil, etc.).
287 2018-10-09 23:24:17 It's all about obstruct and demonize the other side. Dont @ me with whataboutism. 
This horrific law was predicted to be very bad and it is. Carveouts for unions, 17 other classes, ect have disemboweled the law well  before repeal of mandate
288 2018-10-09 23:24:16 But never stand up for Alberta’s oil industry!
289 2018-10-09 23:24:02 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.

291 2018-10-09 23:23:47 -moisturize you lips through out the day

-put coconut oil or vaseline on before you go to bed

-NEVER lick your lips because they will crack and get dry; making them worse
292 2018-10-09 23:23:47 Anybody who believed that "pay increase" snake oil crap needs to have the crap beaten outta them by an oily snake.
293 2018-10-09 23:23:45 #GTLive I think you need some paint thinner for that oil paint? Doesn't Bob Ross keep referring to mixing in the thinner on the palette? 
294 2018-10-09 23:23:36 Got transmission service and oil change and it only took 15/20 minutes. Are they just speedy or did I get screwed?

Hey, Chris, buddy... who bought oil paints?!

296 2018-10-09 23:23:29 I can tell you this. My 3 dogs are on CBD oil its help’s with seizures, arthritis, pain and fear (anxiety) and it also has other good benefits (cancer patient take cbd to help them eat and not feel nauseous etc )  The weed affect you won’t remember much once it wears off.
297 2018-10-09 23:23:25 If i mistakenly pour diesel oil in my petrol engine and try to start it, will it work?
298 2018-10-09 23:23:20 I can get the oil changed anywhere that has some warranty certification (I forget what it's called)

This particular oil change was free with a coupon, so I don't care what prices they wrote on the invoice.
299 2018-10-09 23:23:15 The "Big Oil" lobby dictates the Republican narrative on climate change, rather obviously, at the expense of all....plus; Oil and gas prices are currently artificially inflated.
300 2018-10-09 23:23:14 But Ted, you said and did nothing while 150,000 TX high paying oil & gas jobs were lost while Trump was pushing to save a few hundred coal miner jobs. If you supported nat gas, you would have pushed a plan to end coal for electricity. Its the nastiest energy source on earth....
301 2018-10-09 23:23:00 Baby Oil!
302 2018-10-09 23:22:56 Eeww lurgi! get well soon! Hot lemon and honey always works but so do cod liver oil pills - one a day!
303 2018-10-09 23:22:53 That being said, LNG sure is preferable to the alternatives, which are oil and coal, so exploitation or not is still makes sense on a global level to help Asia out by shipping them our gas, seeing as we get most of our power from Mica and Revelstoke dams.
304 2018-10-09 23:22:50 You can go ahead and dissolve 100-250 grams in 1/2-1 liter of warm water for a magnesium oil solution for transdermal application. I use a spray bottle for better application but it can be put on the hands and applied that way. You want to be soaking wet
305 2018-10-09 23:22:48 And deep breath...Jojoba oil....and some other oils too...a sista is tired.
306 2018-10-09 23:22:41 I'm no fan of Trudeau, however denying we have a serious problem & less than 3 elxn cycles to cap warming@ 1.5C to avoid climate chaos is unacceptable. We don't have time to suffer ANY govt that is not only refusing to heed scientists, but especially those colluding w. OIL lobby.
307 2018-10-09 23:22:17 That has always been the case for at least 1 millennium. Has not happened, yet.
We've become downright stupid over that millennium & that needs to be addressed with the highest priority so the coming generations can at least think.
Next priority is getting rid of oil dependence
308 2018-10-09 23:22:12 The Republican Party has proven time after time that they are beholden to the oil lobby, will sell our future for more gas extraction and money, and will not stop until the planet is boiling and we’re all under twenty feet of salt water. 2/
309 2018-10-09 23:22:09 That HAS to be oil.
That... paint is so expensive...
AND IT WON’T DRY.

AND OIL PAINTS CAN’T BE WASHED WITH WATER!

325 2018-10-09 23:20:25 We don't use unethical oil in BC. Unless you call Alaksan or AB oil unethical of course. 2016 subsidies to Cdn oil companies over $4B meanwhile gas at a price now when it was $100 oil, so who's ethical again? #usingmyethicaloilbasedphone

334 2018-10-09 23:19:18 If you and other D's did not stand in the way, we could MOVE in SOME direction to see what works. We all know ACA is not it. Even dems admit it's deeply flawed. The people suffer while you argue and obstruct.

340 2018-10-09 23:18:17 So what you are saying is, if carbon pricing worked, we should see some kind of measurable effect of a 2 year reduction in GHG's in Australia, even though the world has been using GHG producing oil for approximately 150 years and coal since the industrial revolution?

Oils should be able to be burnt in braziers
Braziers said fuck you and wouldn't let you actually put oil in them

Or light them

They refused to be braziers, basically

That now works

The oil burn messages are now visible

354 2018-10-09 23:16:25 One can but hope...it is a step up from the trend of the local power company running the media - like the Canadian oil company owned newspaper that headlined a refinery explosion this weekend as ‘A Thanksgiving Miracle’
355 2018-10-09 23:16:11 Because, dear boy, we can see that you are selling snake oil, not sovereignty

India just bought Iran's oil outyput with rupees.
358 2018-10-09 23:15:36 Yes, expecting something in Federal Register, rulemaking with comments, etc. Told it will be expedited with goal of summer. It is not the finish line, but a positive step. Oil interests have also announced lawsuits, but that is standard.
359 2018-10-09 23:15:26 And I wouldn't be friends with the Shill types and permabulls and snake oil merchants on CT, so it's hard to even try to empathize.
360 2018-10-09 23:15:24 With ACA you get the privilege of paying exorbitant rates for policy, plus exorbitant deductibles on top of that. Essentially being charged TWICE. CAT plans in effect let you buy health bankruptcy ins, at  cheaper rate, letting you keep more of your own money

364 2018-10-09 23:14:48 And that is not a comforting thought. Russia’s population is in rapid decline—down to about 143 million, male life expectancy is at third-world levels. They don’t have much to sell except for oil, gas, missiles & nukes.

367 2018-10-09 23:14:13 BTW I’m all for pipelines...all 3 would be great. Just a question on the oil price comparisons...south east sask produces Bakken as well and wonder if they get premium price also ? Assume some goes in Enbridge and some must rail to customers same as ND railed Bakken.

376 2018-10-09 23:13:11 What Ted Cruz really means is that big oil is destroying Texas highways and farm-to-market roads with their heavy equipment and overweight tankers but shouldn't be paying any taxes to remediate their destruction of our infrastructure. #BetoForTexas

416 2018-10-09 23:08:44 If we didn't use oil Russia & the Middle East would go bankrupt. Whole industries would collapse. Wall Street would tank. The growth economy would sputter. Depression.
A smooth transition would take decades. It's gonna hurt.

423 2018-10-09 23:07:11 Actually, hemp can replace a lot of those materials. Its cheaper and renewable. Alternative energy sources would lower cost (eventually) and save lives. It makes a ton of sense strategically. 

Additionally, it will lessen our dependence on oil, making it less like we go to war.

In 1980 when phone rang you answered, everyone did.  I dont answer any not on call list period. So give up please.
443 2018-10-09 23:04:29 Wonder what he would think if he owned the oil. Then it would be the greatest oil in the world. People would say it’s great oil, the best oil. The oil would be priceless.

448 2018-10-09 23:04:03 It's patently wrong to say that carbon taxes "don't confront fossil fuel companies." Of course they do, through raising the price of NG, coal, oil, etc. and reducing demand for carbon-intensive fuels.
449 2018-10-09 23:03:53 Yes. So stop it with the oil already. You've KNOWN for decades that your actions would cause catastrophic worldwide environmental changes but you had to make money, right?

454 2018-10-09 23:03:08 I read a couple years ago that if every piece of transportation based on oil or coal stopped operating, you'd reduce CO2 by 11%.

*just* 11% if every car, truck, and train simply stopped.

really nailed into perspective that which bulb I use might not be a meaningful difference.
455 2018-10-09 23:03:08 Why not also unimpeded inportation of gasoline/diesel? Why put so much regulatory req’ts on anyone wanting to import diesel fr Russia? If India is allowed or can buy oil from Iran, why don’t we?
456 2018-10-09 23:03:07 Ethanol makes less mpg... increases octane but less mpg solid science there... 

now if you’re making corn oil into biodiesel fuel same mpg.. 
If they got rid of the BS EGR on diesels the would get better MPG

477 2018-10-09 22:59:50 Brush saving tip: instead of using dish soap to get your oil brushes clean, use hand soap. Hand soap is easier on the bristles and won’t leave them brittle and in need of a conditioning as fast

550 2018-10-09 22:52:08 Better IMO to compare $ETH / $ETC to oil than to fiat money. If the supply / demand of oil were stable + accessible enough, it could be used as money. Until then, its value beyond speculation is the division of the sum of the values of all systems that demand it. #Ethereum

567 2018-10-09 22:49:39 Well, the husband and wife who own Cinemark donated $1000000 in 12/17 to a PAC where all the money goes to Cruz. We might not be able to fight Big Oil and Gas, but we can easily stop going to Cinemark where dollars from our pocket go into Rafi's pocket.

570 2018-10-09 22:49:33 I’m struggling to work through an assignment and the only solution I came up with was to rub both my focus and stress relief essential oil scents onto my wrists at once so that’s how my life is going right now

593 2018-10-09 22:47:52 i literally did an oil change the day before school started and my car already needs another one ummm
594 2018-10-09 22:47:41 Terrain went back to the shop, still dealing with oil consumption issues after replacing the engine. We are now being told it's the PCV

605 2018-10-09 22:46:16 @nickmangwana @matigary @MthuliNcube 

I have a feeling that people are buying RTGS on the blackmarket, then buying cooking oil, then selling it in Zambia,SA,Moz for USD for profit, and repeating this process, over and over again.

This might be happening with other products to

612 2018-10-09 22:45:45 @Take5_OilChange My husband took my car in for an oil change yesterday. Paid $93.44. I have never paid that price for an oil change there. Windshield dirty and had to stop at Discount Tires to get air today.  Sticker says next change 3/7/2019 or 100,325. My mileage is 105,376.

615 2018-10-09 22:45:26 I think I have some peppermint oil & have never even opened it. I'm willing to trying anything at this point be wise rubbing my own temporals isn't working!
616 2018-10-09 22:45:17 Remember when another liberal President went on broadcast tv and told the world we are out of oil ? There’s no more oil!
617 2018-10-09 22:45:04 Mom and dad take theirs to jiffy lube. Or I can talk to Devin and see if he’ll do it if you buy the oil. He was gonna do mine.

624 2018-10-09 22:44:30 It’s probs not even that bad , just use bio oil
625 2018-10-09 22:44:16 Nice spin....and also not true. The true is part is that emission reduced and that was for two reasons 1. Ontario closed coal plants (a move that got her jeers from the CPC 2. Economic downturn lowered the price of oil and also consuption....but thanks for playing
626 2018-10-09 22:43:47 Last week US Net imports of Crude oil was 1MMbld higher than last year. Yes you read that correctly. Combined with 1.4MMbl higher production. US withheld 17 MMbl more crude in a single week.

644 2018-10-09 22:41:04 I'm neglectful with my vehicles for sure but honestly,  I've found...just make sure it's got oil lol. I wouldn't recommend not changing it of course.

650 2018-10-09 22:40:32 Indeed. His first few ads were really good and hopeful, but he never got past that. Probably because he knows the positions he’s taken won’t play well in Texas.

653 2018-10-09 22:40:23 LOLZ. An oil fund isn't volatile it is used because the price of oil can volatile. I mean why would money be volatile??

667 2018-10-09 22:38:28 There are over 113 cannabinoids in the Hemp plant which his oil is made from. The NCAA rules state that they test for THC not the others. The oil has less then 0.03% THC in it. With such little amount of THC wouldn’t that be the reason there was no THC detected?

676 2018-10-09 22:37:03 And to be honest I don't blame you, the meat dairy and egg industry has managed to brainwash everyone into thinking that they need to eat animals for nutrients such as calcium, protein, B12 etc. These people have more money than the oil industry.
677 2018-10-09 22:36:55 Stop you only started talking politics when you got an oil field job LOL
678 2018-10-09 22:36:50 Our Agric economy with engages more than 70% of  our population which was part of our colonial legacy before Oil the oil sector engages less than 1% but i see your point bcos since FG, States and LG depend on Oil for serious revenue due to their laziness to diversify
679 2018-10-09 22:36:45 Thing is, it's probably already too late.  We use and rely on oil heavily.  Then there is rail / highway & ocean transport / airlines / manufacturing.  There is yet to be a viable alternative.  We haven't moved fast enough.  Repealing carbon tax is a backwards move.

685 2018-10-09 22:35:51 but its savory... and theres no butter in it. maybe oil? im not sure how its made. but its a lot tougher in texture than pastry
686 2018-10-09 22:35:49 Another example of the government in disarray. UK has potential to be leaders in electrification, transform multiple industries.... but no, look back to the golden days of North Sea oil revenue.

689 2018-10-09 22:35:41 Looks heavy on veg but maybe it's all about a dough that is made with olive oil ? I'd be interested in feedback about flavour and whether it tasted like focaccia. I've baked it many times and it's simple to make.

And fuel is still high, we are borrowing more and prices at the market are not coming down.. So WHERE IS THE MONEY? doesn't it tell you Buhari and his cronies are relooting it?
697 2018-10-09 22:34:57 Do they have an oil industry that has zero tolerance for pot? If they do, most likely they have an opioid crisis . 3 on 3 off shifts are  actually 2, on whatever pill or powder that clears the system for the urine test during the last week. Main cause for opioid crisis in Canada.
698 2018-10-09 22:34:57 New Ethanol fuel rules in one hour. Good for Farmers. Good for jobs.

Some people are not happy.

Guess who?

The Oil Companies and Politicians getting paid by Oil Companies.
699 2018-10-09 22:34:56 minutes it lasted... the mirror said,
(You are you concieted bastard!).
Yo that's true, that's why we never have no beef,
So then I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth.
Used "Oil of Olay" cause my skin gets pale.
Then I got the files, for my fingernails.

701 2018-10-09 22:34:47 Gaddafi was going to introduce gold Dinar as currency to make African EU. Ditto oil/dollar matrix. Can't have another EU to challange US hegemony. You really have very little idea how geo politics operates! Do you know where & why ww1 started?
702 2018-10-09 22:34:42 Those Civics run forever. Just keep changing the oil. This right here is motivation that you don't need the fancy foreign. Kept your Civic and invested that awful car payment. Awesome.
703 2018-10-09 22:34:30 Yes! I will not buy products that contain palm oil sustainable or otherwise! Please #droppalmoil. #boycottpalmoil
704 2018-10-09 22:34:27 A men’s make up is and should be the dirt, grease and oil left on his face after he whipped the sweat from his brow after a days work
705 2018-10-09 22:34:22 you think you’re a hard guy ? splash water in hot oil and stand
706 2018-10-09 22:34:13 i hope he puts some oil on his pillow like my mum used to do
707 2018-10-09 22:34:06 I have a coupon to get my oil changed so now that it's been 6,400 miles I guess I'll do that
708 2018-10-09 22:34:01 Oil done, tires next 
709 2018-10-09 22:33:47 My scar is almost invisible now thanks to bio oil  but numb definitely lol
710 2018-10-09 22:33:38 Baby oil as lube CANT be ok. *goes to google*
711 2018-10-09 22:33:36 Irony of irony increase of oil was work wide, but it's not enough reason for the govt not To mitigate, there are may move the establishment can do
712 2018-10-09 22:33:25 How in the world would you pay more? Ethanol is $.90/gal less than gasoline. Five percent more of that?! Only reason gas prices are high is we export crude versus using it at home, and then import more. Great system of profit for oil companies.

716 2018-10-09 22:32:40 bitch bout to have a yeast infection from that baby oil
717 2018-10-09 22:32:34 おはようございます(*^^*)
718 2018-10-09 22:32:33 I’ve been mixing in tea tree oil with my Ponds dry skin face cream and i can really see a difference.... Not only with my dry skin but with my blackhead/acne prone areas as well(:
719 2018-10-09 22:32:32 Oh dear. You really have bought the jingoism. The reason Hussain had to go was he wanted to trade oil in Euros. US needs dollar/oil matrix to run largest military complex on earth. Stan is still going 15 yrs later for resources in that country. Minerals & opium mainly. Wake up!
720 2018-10-09 22:32:25 also the situation is similar to 2008 because the global interest n oil prices are high.
721 2018-10-09 22:32:14 Good luck to The Boys Soccer Team as they take on The Oil City Oilers tonight #BulldogNation
722 2018-10-09 22:32:11 There's a catch this is just a band aid over a wound that will last for years. Guarantee this will have no effect on our shitty markets and big oil, grocery will get their way. From a farmer who thinks your bailout is a joke and won't take it.
723 2018-10-09 22:31:47 My baby changed my oil , changed my spark plugs , changed my connector piece for my headlights and now he rotating my tires  . That’s a real man  andddd he gone wash it tomorrow  I love me some him !

727 2018-10-09 22:31:03 I wash my body with dove and baby oil
My skin be smooth like a mf
728 2018-10-09 22:31:02 Does this mean it will not be good to carry on Business as Usual?
BTW Tell this to the Swiss, the real Deep State.  They do not give 2 Shits about Climate Change and want to continue with Palm Oil, sending Yuge shipments of Swiss Chemicals for fracking and Tar Sands.
729 2018-10-09 22:31:01 So we infiltrating and shutting off these oil refineries or what?
730 2018-10-09 22:30:32 that’s not really true. most of property in VZ is privately owned- just their major export, oil, is nationalized/heavily subsidised. however, the same could be said for the US regarding our major products- corn and beef.

732 2018-10-09 22:30:27 Yes! I also did a stint in oil & gas and you could get cited for so many things. Like not having a cover for your coffee cup, not holding the rail when on the stairs, or running in the office! :)
733 2018-10-09 22:30:25 Anything to make a buck!  #MeToo and Bill and Hillary Clinton seem like oil and water!!!!
734 2018-10-09 22:30:13 おいる三郎さん！ありがとうございます
735 2018-10-09 22:30:11 I hear some supposedly educated ones shouting that the govt should save now that the oil price is going up... Smh

Where on earth do you want the govt to get money to fund the deficit budget?

*Una better thank God we have a frugal President, not like the one we sent packing.
736 2018-10-09 22:30:03 Mix oil and water together. You will see they will soon layer up with oil on top. This is their order or arrangement. Throw 100 hammers in water randomly they will all stand up on their heads in order. Entire universe is arranged like a hammer in water. A ship floats as per order
737 2018-10-09 22:30:01 I'm mad that my body reacts so negatively to sugar. I have a cup of chocolate almond milk a day for two days and my face breaks out like I never discovered oil absorbing wipes
738 2018-10-09 22:29:51 Coconut oil is my new thing. Not a single complaint so far.
739 2018-10-09 22:29:39 Getting an oil change after work was one of the worst decisions I’ve made in a longggg time 
740 2018-10-09 22:29:37 Insanity is keeping the same team & believing they you will B better because of “experience “if Todd  has to be 14-5-1 or he’s fired . If the oil are not sitting comfortably in a playoff spot come the all star break . Chia has to go . How many seasons you going to waste McDavid
741 2018-10-09 22:29:28 Norway apart from size has totally different issues to Scotland it for a start has eye watering taxes and cost of living, it also has a national debt and food banks, they will struggle when the oil goes.
742 2018-10-09 22:29:19 I love the Marula oil as a moisturizer and their bha chemical peel really got me right
743 2018-10-09 22:29:11 President Trump has our Economy in great shape best in years . And the Feds and high oil prices are trying to help the Democrats make him look bad. By slowing our economy down.
744 2018-10-09 22:29:09 I requested no pepper in my Chinese. I also requested a chilli oil pot. I then proceeded to put chilli oil in my food. I don’t like pepper 
745 2018-10-09 22:29:07 He will be fine some of his favourite pop eyes chicken and some CBD oil will be good to go for a payday
746 2018-10-09 22:28:59 Asad Umar has said many times on TV, i have heard him say it that in 2013 there was no other option than going to IMF by Dar & Pml and they were helped by low global interest rate n Oil was low as well, they did not use that cushion for structural reforms.
747 2018-10-09 22:28:55 honestly, i’ve been doing a bad job putting myself in position to acquire a genie. i’ve literally never rubbed an oil lamp. that’s on me.
748 2018-10-09 22:28:54 None I know of have denounced any of this mob activity or violence. In fact, encourage more of it by direct statements for more people to join in and fundraising off of it to finance more of it. 
These militants operate with stamp of approval from Democrats
749 2018-10-09 22:28:53 Also @Dom_Montgomery can you provide us with a list of the better together promises that have been kept? Also can you explain to us how Norway has a trillion dollar oil fund and Scotland doesn't even though Scotland produces more oil?
750 2018-10-09 22:28:52 CRAB OIL FOR ALL 2018
751 2018-10-09 22:28:49 Yes the oil is a moisturizer/sealant.
752 2018-10-09 22:28:49 friendly reminder not to sniff too much olbas oil if u are ill and lose ur voice for 3 days like i did 2 years ago
753 2018-10-09 22:28:47 They eat the dainty food of famous chefs with the same pleasure with which they devour gross peasant dishes, mostly composed of garlic and tomatoes, or fisherman's octopus and shrimps, fried in heavily scented olive oil on a little deserted beach.
754 2018-10-09 22:28:34 Dad ask how long it take to mow my yard,I said 4 cold beer not because the yards big but because I love them SOB’s after a ass buster of a day in the oil patch
755 2018-10-09 22:28:32 Yeah yeah,aspirants will be promising to deregulate the oil and gas sector.. my question is how do they plan to handle the silly unions — nupeng + pengassan induced fuel scarcity that follows?
756 2018-10-09 22:28:23 You can mix it with your juice ONLY if it is a vape drip version. MCT oil and water soluble should not be heated.
757 2018-10-09 22:28:18 All of this is capitalist bullshit. We need to stop oil and gas companies now by forcing divestment this year.
758 2018-10-09 22:28:13 Also @Dom_Montgomery can you provide us with a list of the better together promises that have been kept? Also can you explain to us how Norway has a trillion dollar oil fund and Scotland doesn't even though Scotland produces more oil?
759 2018-10-09 22:28:11 So I recently read that coating things with mayo work well on the bbq. Time to experiment.

Though, to reduce the risk of having just carbs for dinner (beer), I think I'll do the other pork loin with the bog-standard salt-thyme-garlic-pepper-vinegar-oil method.
760 2018-10-09 22:27:56 @chloeward__xxx FACT. And because it is oil based using it too much damages your lip 
761 2018-10-09 22:27:50 Vegan spaghetti sauce:

763 2018-10-09 22:27:44 サマイチはラブコメだから
764 2018-10-09 22:27:37  that is amazing lmao dude but no fr when you do get a moisturizer put like two dots of almond oil on what your putting on your face mix it and daaaawwwgggg it’s like magic for your skin
765 2018-10-09 22:27:33 My fav is the Maurila oil. And I bought two because it’s the cheapest anywhere.  Love it in the hair and face. Only other thing I use is the caffeine for the eyes and Buffet. Blur, sounds amazing! Hahaha
766 2018-10-09 22:27:18 Kremlin talking points. f*ck up US energy production to boost price of Russian oil & gas.
767 2018-10-09 22:27:15 And if she plan on using that baby oil down there she gone be burning like a California wildfire
768 2018-10-09 22:27:14 From what I gather from my Facebook feed, CBD oil is the new Essential Oils. MLM companies are set up and did you know it treats/cures like everything?!
769 2018-10-09 22:26:35 Well I’m not impressed with @derekcarrqb play. Are pressing him too much ?  What is it damn it. ITS YOU GRUDEN you snake oil salesman and that idiot Mark kissing your ass to become “head coach “
770 2018-10-09 22:26:11 Kind of unrelated but similar: I had the depressing thought that the modern day oil barons are going to be some of the select few that will be able to afford to survive when the dire warnings we heard from client scientists this week come to pass.
771 2018-10-09 22:25:45 If oil revenue picks up significantly then great, I'll revisit this. I have no ideological objection to independence.
772 2018-10-09 22:25:42 Looks like it's a bit much.
773 2018-10-09 22:25:42 I’m sitting on the roof in an A-shirt covered in baby oil as we speak
774 2018-10-09 22:25:27 #OPEC can influence global oil price in its favor. #Iraq, #Kurdistan & #KSA are able to fill the crude supply gap in case of #Iranian economic collapse
775 2018-10-09 22:25:26 Bread and oil
776 2018-10-09 22:25:21 Oil and Gas.
Your company consolidated oil and gas in my community (Sangana in BYS)
No fair treatment from your from you to your host community.

779 2018-10-09 22:24:50 Better to buy Canadian oil than oil from Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc.... the list of countries India imports significant amounts of crude ought to include Canada a democratic ally.
780 2018-10-09 22:24:40 Are you tweeting  this comment from the east coast ? You know where all the unregulated terrorist supporting  blood oil comes in from ?
781 2018-10-09 22:24:40 Ahh thank you. Would the oil be considered a moisturizer or just a sealant ?
782 2018-10-09 22:24:35 All you need now is some oil all over that outfit
783 2018-10-09 22:24:09 Of course it would be less expensive and more effective to decrease global warming and decrease algae growth as well as severity of hurricanes.  Wind and Solar is less expensive and and can save our planet.  You think Trump and Gov Scott are in the pockets of coal/oil CEOs?
784 2018-10-09 22:23:57 sounds yummy.. Go coconut oil.. love it.. BKFST: I have 2 Black Chia biscuit, 1 Almond biscuit homemade, a soft boiled F/R egg n black coffee.. fills me up, Protein n Omega 3..yummm
785 2018-10-09 22:23:53 I did an oil vid and now it's like, collected under the folds of my tits, and idk if I like that
786 2018-10-09 22:23:50 Its the price of oil!!!!!
787 2018-10-09 22:23:39 And the organizer and administrator of this vast income redistribution scheme would be, I suppose, the UN? Which did such a superlative job with oil-for-food? Seriously?
788 2018-10-09 22:23:38 So you will pay millions for algae problem, but you will give away billions to oil and coal to screw our environment.
789 2018-10-09 22:23:31 Protecting oil & gas companies.
790 2018-10-09 22:23:26 True, at 92% to be exact. I agree. The two are not mutually exclusive. The same "oil industry" you describe is also working in those developing nations in ways that could be better served by non-carbon energy solutions.

150k die from air pollution in the US, we can do better.
791 2018-10-09 22:23:25 That is kinda awesome! It would be neat if using that one opened up the Earth's vast crude beer reserves!
792 2018-10-09 22:23:24 Unless the economy can generate 3% or greater growth it will probably stay above 1T. Our trade deficit has increased. Oil prices have increased 65% since he took office.

796 2018-10-09 22:22:52 @DonaldJTrumpJr would be nothing but an oil slick.
797 2018-10-09 22:22:51 Fully agree we use far to much palm oil and its only because it's cheap I'm sure the British consumers would happily pay a little bit more not to have palm oil
798 2018-10-09 22:22:37 Oil scents last
799 2018-10-09 22:22:06 Peppermint oil on the temples, caffine,ibuprofen, and a cold forehead compress are my remedies.
800 2018-10-09 22:21:55 People who see through the Snake oil Salesman gimmick
801 2018-10-09 22:21:55 The only oil worth investing in soon will be  Cold Pressed Virgin Olive Oil. #EV #Revolution #Combustion #Engine #Dead 
802 2018-10-09 22:21:52 I just saw someone post asking if cannabis oil is seen as sinful. The part that appalled me more was the response “Talk to your pastor to help you make that decision”. This is the problem I have with religion.
803 2018-10-09 22:21:52 The problem for the left is that pollution control and climate change have become one in the same.  Climate change happens - pollution is us and it’s bad.  For those that don’t agree give me your address I’m gonna start dumping all my trash, motor oil and carcinogenics there
804 2018-10-09 22:21:22 I brush my teeth with coconut oil
805 2018-10-09 22:21:20 正規職員からパートかバイトに移ることって可能なんだろうか…チーフに相談しなきゃなぁ
806 2018-10-09 22:21:18 yeah... Half of the oil bought and sold would run the blockchain.. Very good to markets...
807 2018-10-09 22:21:13 If so, then the oil and it’s distribution network is also infrastructure for the plane.
808 2018-10-09 22:21:06 Lavender or tea tree oil and certain supplements such as Dong Quai and Tribulus terrestris have also been associated with #gynecomastia.

812 2018-10-09 22:20:55 Oh diba, oh diba... kasalanan talaga ng oil price hike kung bakit mahal lahat ng bilihin. Ang galing kasi ng mga nasa gabinete niya. 
813 2018-10-09 22:20:53 BJP gas ও oil  দাম কেনবারিয়েছে জানেন তবে জানাব জোদি কোন bjp mancha কোনদিন উঠলে এতে bjp কোন দোসনেই
814 2018-10-09 22:20:51 They have plenty to trade with oil,whiskey,Gin,Meat,water just some of our biggest exports,to give you a few examples 
815 2018-10-09 22:20:48 Would you be willing to join the fight for the American Wild Horses? They are being exterminated by the BLM. To make way for cattle, oil and mining interests. Like in developing countries now...these animals built this country! Protected by law...but being decimated. Thank you...
816 2018-10-09 22:20:46 Buhari Govt have been quick to tell you that the crude oil price had fallen to $35 per barrel in a bid to market their prudence. The Presidency even provided for a $45  per barrel crude benchmark in the 2018 Budget. It took the firmness of the Saraki-led National Assembly to

818 2018-10-09 22:20:26 Like allocating oil well to you, ota farms staffs to be paying by federal government, stop efcc activities,and dance according to our tunes (mhh Baban iyabo)
819 2018-10-09 22:20:23 "tony blair can't be a war criminal. thats just offensive rhetoric. i mean, we know what war criminals look like. he can't be a war criminal, i mean, he listens to oasis!"  (rob newman, history of oil)
820 2018-10-09 22:19:51 I don't fucking care how much crude oil was then. With the price it was in 2015 till date. Name 3 infrastructural projects.
821 2018-10-09 22:19:47 It beggars belief are investing in oil.
822 2018-10-09 22:19:46 I got "bless your heart"ed by the checkout lady at the oil change place today.   I know, I was supposed to do it 7000 miles ago, but life happened...

829 2018-10-09 22:19:09 Indy Scotland in the EU would be part of any deal UK makes with EU, as a member.  But if you think England wouldn't want to buy our energy, our water, our oil, our gas... You've got to be JOKING! You have NONE of those things & would be VERY costly to get them elsewhere.

832 2018-10-09 22:18:49 自分の恋心に気づいたいちろ~、サマからのわかりにくい愛情表現にだんだん気づいてしまいどぎまぎしてしまう……かわいい……………
833 2018-10-09 22:18:42 Thanks to @EddieBarstool for the shoutout on @RedLineRadio . Drank the motor oil, won the contest, and didn’t puke. A very interesting Saturday in the woods to say the least.
834 2018-10-09 22:18:34 Why no details on who had them, how they got them? There is a lot missing from the story, specific reason for this?
835 2018-10-09 22:18:33 All these niggas in my inbox, but who Fenna get my oil changed?  .. oh ok .. FUCK OUT THE SPOT 
836 2018-10-09 22:18:30 The crook and the snake oil salesman
837 2018-10-09 22:18:25 The kind that promised to fix electricity in 6 months, build a refinery every year, make $ = N, draw a line on corruption, regulate the price of oil, and create 3 million jobs annually. Meanwhile, asking for sorcery to perform now is a silent admission of failure. #BuhariMustGo
838 2018-10-09 22:18:17 The Heads of the Oil multi-nationals are calling for action on #climatechange and the leaders of the Industrialised countries are not even listening. Who will they listen to???????????????????
839 2018-10-09 22:18:08 And the bulk of those people dying now come from poor nations that use coal and wood and dung for cooking and heating.  Rather than killing the oil industry, that is cleaner now than ever, we should be helping poorer nations improve.
840 2018-10-09 22:17:57 My oil changes run me $170
841 2018-10-09 22:17:55 As president I will enact FDA quality control check points for olive oil.
842 2018-10-09 22:17:44 How many Westerners know of how Israel ethnically cleansed the Occupied Golan of its indigenous population?  They Leveled whole towns and left only the minority Druze behind.  They want Trump to recognize their illegal occupation.  They want its gas & oil.
843 2018-10-09 22:17:44 Maat Moon, Maat Sun; 
shilajit, honey, blackseed oil, schizandra, ashwaganda, ginger, lemon watermelon strawberry juice, saurkraut juice, chai tea, cayenne, cinnamon.

844 2018-10-09 22:17:40 My kids school bus was hit by an oil truck today. Thankful all the kids on the bus are safe. GOD  is GREAT! 
845 2018-10-09 22:17:37 May your head not lack oil in Jesus name, Amen! — feeling blessed
846 2018-10-09 22:17:36 And all it’s going to take is USA contributing BILLIONS to UN, shutting down all oil refineries, & reducing US emissions to 0! Somehow China & India never have to! 10th time Liberals have tried to foist this on uneducated citizens
847 2018-10-09 22:17:31 Yes yes yes sautéed with onions vermouth olive oil while sipping a nice Cab
848 2018-10-09 22:17:31 PSA to all the ladies: tea tree oil is a miracle worker for those annoying bumps you get from cartilage piercings. I put it on last night and they are almost gone, such a blessing. 
849 2018-10-09 22:17:28 Anxiety tip; if you're having a hard time getting out of bed to go to work, cover all of your work clothes in lavender oil to calm yourself and hope no one notices you sniffing yourself all day.
850 2018-10-09 22:17:17 Pride and love just don’t mix. They’re like oil and water, respectively.

You either lose your pride over the person you love or lose the person you love over your pride.
851 2018-10-09 22:17:13 They’re nice I’ve done tinctures and rubs it works and help calms. thc oil pills are the best doesn’t get you too high but a chill high
852 2018-10-09 22:17:10 Depends on your perspective. Personally, I rather have my oil from the highest environmental standards with regards to human life that uses its resources for the benefit & betterment of its citizens while promoting responsible trade with other nations. There is no logic in OPEC
853 2018-10-09 22:17:00 I’m very aware of what and how it went down. A country with that much oil should have been able to sell it and provide for its people. But they couldn’t sell their oil and couldn’t buy food. And see original thread how Churchill ruined other country’s food production. 
854 2018-10-09 22:16:26 Baby oil is not meant for your hooha 
855 2018-10-09 22:16:04 Baby oil really doesn’t belong anywhere
856 2018-10-09 22:15:54 @10DowningStreet @cabinetofficeuk do you think we should now close the Saudi Embassy in London in case somebody from their country goes "missing" when they visit them? Or would this have a negative effect on the arms contracts/oil situation?
857 2018-10-09 22:15:40 でも鈍いいちろ~はサマにキスされても誰か女と勘違いしてんのかなっておもうんだけど女と勘違いされてキスされたっていうのがなんか嫌だなっておもって、そこで初めて自分の中に燻ってる恋心に気づく
858 2018-10-09 22:15:25 Indomie relish(chicken) taste like disappointment and tasteless palm oil stew!
859 2018-10-09 22:15:19 You Forget that Nigeria economy has never survived on Oil since we would die all these yrs right from IBB era bcos Nigeria would have been extinct by now or in crisis like Venezuela yrs ago! Our economy is Agric based that is why Nigeria never entered a full blown crisis
860 2018-10-09 22:15:19 But tax. I can not comment on the operating margin but clearly global oil prices up nearly 25% since May alone.
861 2018-10-09 22:15:18 Anyone in the Denver area know a good place for CBD oil? Fibromyalgia is keeping me bedridden and I'm ready to kick it in the teeth.

863 2018-10-09 22:15:03 You ought to know about passing records Obozo. It's good to hear you talk about something other than politics for a "change" though because no one is buying your snake oil anymore ...
864 2018-10-09 22:15:00 I could’ve sworn I JUST got an oil change
865 2018-10-09 22:14:59 1947’de Türkiye’ye gelen Amerikan Standart Oil Şirketinden Max Weston Thornburg ve iki arkadaşı Türkiye’ye bir ekonomi raporu hazırlıyor.Rapor neticesinde Türkiye   1947’de İMF’ye üye oluyor.İlk borçlanma 1961’de yapılmış.Hani bunu da bilelim dedim;maksat kültürümüz artsın.
866 2018-10-09 22:14:57 #ImSoRatchet I’ll lube and oil, no filter
867 2018-10-09 22:14:55 Food was ridiculously expensive when
oil prices dropped, because
we don't grow our food. Let's
talk about how the so called
"analog" president,
introduced the anchors
borrowers programme to aid
farmers, and boost
agriculture in Nigeria.Wail again!
868 2018-10-09 22:14:55 Even if you don’t ‘believe in climate change, you have to realize that we’re going to run out of oil and non-reusable energy sources eventually. When that day comes, we’re going to need things like solar energy, and wind power.
869 2018-10-09 22:14:34 This is so weird ... i was talking to a friend today , she asked how ur feeling , i replied ... totally bonanza ... now hearing this oil bonanza   ... b/w excellent interview !
870 2018-10-09 22:14:26 I'm actually getting a headache from all the fumes of the oil paint, oils, and liquin so that's cool
871 2018-10-09 22:14:26 @potus will ask his oil donors to read it for him!
872 2018-10-09 22:14:20 With your level of intelligence, I expected to know the cause of that recession. Venezuela with their level of oil reserve is still battling with it till today. You want to know how Saudi escaped it? It's bcos they had & still hv high foreign reserve! And what did Buhari meet?
873 2018-10-09 22:14:20 Fitting though, considering the whole thing was a sham to invade the middle east and make money from oil....just another revenue stream.
874 2018-10-09 22:13:54 That’s kind of a big part of the whole “insulated from individual, private action” as well as anything but the most unified, and transparent public movements for oil regulation and enforcement.
875 2018-10-09 22:13:51 Wonder if #Kindermorgan is funding oil and car pollution saleswoman far right wing conservative #CoalitionOfVancouverTrumpkins wai young? #vanpoli #cdnpoli
876 2018-10-09 22:13:50 Getting an oil leak in the car fixed today. I'm going to gradually work increasingly larger objects into my arsehole throughout the day so that it doesn't hurt so much when I pick it up and pay the mechanic.
877 2018-10-09 22:13:46 I slept all day because of this weather and I forgot to take my oil to get changed 
878 2018-10-09 22:13:42 Heitkamp has also pointed out the ND voter ID law cuts both ways in terms of partisanship. A lot of rural oil workers out in western ND, where she didn't do well in 2012, could also be disenfranchised by this law.
879 2018-10-09 22:13:39 My re-fried beans in avocado oil were so fucking delicious  OMG! I literally ate the whole pan & wanted more 
880 2018-10-09 22:13:24 Lmaooooo i always got a hook up on my oil change. I come back pregnant, was asked if baby daddy was still in the pic, said yes happily and now Im payin full price

882 2018-10-09 22:13:22 I think it’s one of the healthiest things you can do for yourself. Been doing it since Feb. You’ll lose weight and feel better about yourself. I’ll have a bulletproof coffee with mct oil at 8 am every morning. So it’s not true IF but the results are speaking for themselves.
883 2018-10-09 22:13:07 Hi Jason - read the article you co wrote with Carla. Appreciate a sensitive topic but an idea for you. Look at the change in international oil price using month on month change in WTI and Brent. Then look at the month on month decrease in the NZD. Might suggest not oil companies
884 2018-10-09 22:12:56 Your youth and naïveté are on display. There are more people born everyday; most don’t want to live in mud huts and suffer dysentery.  You seem like a nice middle class white boy. Go to a 3rd world country, live in poverty, then tell me we use oil because the world is corrupt.
885 2018-10-09 22:12:42 just shaved my legs with coconut oil and they are so smooth but now I'm slippery af
886 2018-10-09 22:12:34 I was going to try @AngryManTV's oil and water but when Mason insisted on doing it I just used a little vegetable oil. My first time cooking a skillet hot dog turned into his.

891 2018-10-09 22:12:12 Today I had such ambitious plans to get things done, until I spilled half a bottle of olive oil all over my clothes and the floor! Now I will just sleep for 12 hours! It’s all about balance :)
892 2018-10-09 22:11:55 blah blah ....For public consumption only. The truth is that UK and US have reassured Saudi Arabia of their unconditional support (to their last drop of oil).
893 2018-10-09 22:11:48 i started using oil blotting sheets today and my life is changed forever

898 2018-10-09 22:11:19 No... that would be U sweet cheeks..Your misinformation campaign is being called out for "snake oil" that it is. Maybe Kanye can provide a platform for your warped ideology.

901 2018-10-09 22:11:00 getting oil stains in your clothes is very annoying this shit won’t come out
902 2018-10-09 22:11:00 Let's talk about how it took a
Buhari to finally heed the
many requests for funds by
ASUU to improve welfare of
staff, and provision of critical
infrastructure in Nigerian
Universities. One Govt Signed
the MoU IN 2013 when oil
prices were high, but failed to
do anything.
903 2018-10-09 22:10:49 It gives a reason for Canadian Gov’t to strike a claim for North Pole (Oil). UK,Russia,USA,Norway,Canada. All claim North Pole. By keeping people there. Canada has a moral justification to have claim N.pole. High Suicide rate & diseases. High cost to keep them there.

906 2018-10-09 22:10:26 My boss, who was standing over the fryer, got hit with a drop of burning oil and his wife just sat and laughed at him as he exclaimed in pain....

That is a relationship I want in my own life.

912 2018-10-09 22:09:42 Improved mileage would have been great ...but it was secondary to keeping engine clean inside....as long as ranchid regulator don't move goal posts hope to get another 7/8 years ...change oil religiously every 5/6000 ....
913 2018-10-09 22:09:35 @ctvwinnipeg on your 5 pm news at the bottom of the screen it said the oil refinery was in Nova Scotia, wrong! It should be New Brunswick.
914 2018-10-09 22:09:33 So lets light up the Eiffel tower, which looks like an old school oil rig. If your really worried about it, quit driving , quit buying third world products ,quit eating hamburgers and bacon. start using candles to read yo books. The planet is in a warming trend that is normal
915 2018-10-09 22:09:30 @MichaelAvenatti would beat the fucking dog shit out of Mr. I Kill Elephants for fun. My guy Don Jr is a human oil slick with a silver spoon in his asshole. He deff committed treason and he’s gross.
916 2018-10-09 22:09:28 Think it would depend where in the world you are, where ever you are just google best cbd oils in your country etc, there are loads of review sites that test them, read up cbd oil for crohns too, ive heard amazing stories about it :)
917 2018-10-09 22:09:11 But if you want to work in the Oil & Gas industry, you are a monster who must be stopped at any cost, right?
918 2018-10-09 22:09:03 Monster tastes like motor oil from autozone.
919 2018-10-09 22:09:02 I’m a sucker for a chicken stuffed with an onion, doused in olive oil and powdered with garlic and paprika.
920 2018-10-09 22:08:48 As much as it's the ndp's job to appear to not want to hang every oil field worker in alberta out to hang?

928 2018-10-09 22:07:52 Those trend lines for oil, coal, & gas don't look like those polluting sources of energy will drop by 2/3rds in the next decade, which is the timeframe for decarbonization scientists are telling us is necessary to avoid the worst effects.

931 2018-10-09 22:07:22 it might mean that we would need a global government to seize the major fossil fuel extraction firms and impose a supremely harsh regulation on energy consumption which would by definition be a vicious attack on capital owners (especially oil resource owners)
932 2018-10-09 22:07:14 Intersection #Energy, #Economy and #Climate again stronger this week:

934 2018-10-09 22:07:01 Trump puts people in charge of the very offices or agencies that they want to destroy. Charter School owner in charge of the education, Oil Man in charge of the EPA, a retarded Texas man who said he wanted to get rid of the Department of energy in charge, list goes on...
935 2018-10-09 22:06:50 Of course! What else would you expect him to say....given his corporate overlords in Big Oil and FOX News?
936 2018-10-09 22:06:36 Another massive storm with loss of homes, businesses and lives.  Getting worse because Trump and Republicans are paid off by coal and oil CEOs.  Clean energy costs less than coal and oil.  Regardless of what you believe there is no risk and you can save the planet! VOTE GOP OUT!
937 2018-10-09 22:06:35 All of this goes back to 2016, when then-President Barack Obama floated the idea of a $10 a barrel tax on oil, paid by energy companies, to fund infrastructure investment. The Democrat wanted to target those dollars
938 2018-10-09 22:06:34 Thanks, Pugsley. We are earth, atmospheric and solar scientists and Professional Engineers. We do the critical review on #climate and #energy projects and provide people and policymakers with food for thought. No Big Oil PR ppl here. Sorry to disappoint Ted.

942 2018-10-09 22:06:14 Yes. USA drop Paris Climate Accord and now is the Top oil and Gas exporter. They are following and production is Declining. Hahaha. Everybody is onboard. How much Carbon tax is  charging on Imported oil and Natural Gas ?????

947 2018-10-09 22:05:45 If a cake recipe calls for the use of oil could you use melted butter instead? I don't quite like the idea of putting oil into a cake

963 2018-10-09 22:04:34 My aunt has trouble sleeping and she fell asleep so I put some oils in her oil diffuser to help her sleep and she’s been knocked out for like 2 hours:,)
964 2018-10-09 22:04:02 It may seem arbitrary, but that's not the point. Don't sink money into doomed projects when you could use that money on transitioning off oil. See the problem here? Letting use keep polluting isn't helpful.
965 2018-10-09 22:03:46 And China is capitalist with a lot of fascist characteristics. It imports oil, so it's definitely not a petrostate.
966 2018-10-09 22:03:44 and I am no longer
afraid of anything, save
the life that, here, awaits.
I don't belong to anyone.
My heart is heavy as an oil drum.
I don't want to be alone.
My heart is yellow as an ear of corn,
and I have torn my soul apart, from
pulling artlessly with fool commands.
967 2018-10-09 22:03:43 A man I don’t even know paid $75 today for CBD oil for my injured cat because I couldn’t afford it. #goodkarma
968 2018-10-09 22:03:42 I hope you plan to boycott Disney and not Drive cars, since Senators from Florida and Texas also voted to confirm Kavanaugh. Why just punish my State?! Equal opportunity boycotting! Walk to work! Boycott big oil! Down with Mickey Mouse! Why stop at just the lobster?! #Hypocrites
969 2018-10-09 22:03:37 If you ever have an interest in getting into the energy sector, Jocko Oil sounds good.
970 2018-10-09 22:03:32 Meanwhile he's in India pushing dirty AB oil. He should maybe push renewables or he can learn from India about them.
971 2018-10-09 22:03:28 I like to make garlic paste and my own curry spice.  And my own garlic oil.  I tried blending my own Garam Masala spice blend, but I could never get it right.
972 2018-10-09 22:03:23 Literally: to sell oil
973 2018-10-09 22:03:22 took off the silky and damn near fainted from what I saw. invest in some avocado oil bro lol
974 2018-10-09 22:03:18 And consider what he did over the years relative to Venezuela. Chavez took over the oil and kicked the Corps (British controlled) out. Suddenly they could not sell their oil anywhere and had trouble getting food imported (world’s food supply is controlled by a few corps) 1/2
975 2018-10-09 22:03:18 B) The energy required for human food to energy paaales in comparison to the raw materials, manufacturing, oil extraction, carbon emissions, freeway building (energy + raw materials), parking lot building (energy + raw materials).
976 2018-10-09 22:03:10 Kanye West! But many say are looking "East," isn't that where "oil" is?
977 2018-10-09 22:03:07 As long as oil stays up, the inversion will be prevented, but when oil fades, WTIC under $59, you will get that inversion, low spread was about .18 basis points
978 2018-10-09 22:02:54 From an American perspective they don't need the Saudi's as much as they did in 92. America is about to be the biggest exporter of oil next year.
979 2018-10-09 22:02:52 spending my day off getting my oil changed, living my best life
980 2018-10-09 22:02:39 TFW you find out @sundayriley is based in Houston and has a couple jobs you’re interested in, and you start fantasizing about bathing in the company Luna Night Oil fountain. 
981 2018-10-09 22:02:38 Palm oil is in loads of items with animal products in them so what’s your point??
982 2018-10-09 22:02:37 Take a look at the over 1000 companies registered to the Trumps. They cover the spectrum including health and beauty.
What I do believe is that neither Bannon or Trump would use any of the snake oil products they sell.
983 2018-10-09 22:02:36 PS, you really should try dipping garlic fries in mayo mixed with a little bit of olive oil. So good.
984 2018-10-09 22:02:35 The first thing to try is WD40, 3 in 1 or Baby Oil. Apply liberally and leave for overnight. The oil can slowly seep between the glue and the substrate and the glue can be prised off. Patience is the key.

986 2018-10-09 22:02:19 According to Fairwinds cannabis company, Cannabidiol (CBD) is more bioavailable when suspended in avocado oil tjan in the more popular and well-known coconut oil.

I suspect that taking one's oil along with an avocado snack isn't  a terrible idea; avocado is a myelin-builder.
987 2018-10-09 22:02:12 In all seriousness, I had clients in the Oil & Gas industry -- they were very serious about reducing workplace accidents b/c it can lead to huge disasters.

989 2018-10-09 22:01:49 Price changes for Thursday. Winter blending in effect: Heating/stove oils to increase by 1.8 cents a litre. Diesel to increase by 1.9 cents a litre. Gasoline shows 3/10ths of a cent a litre. Oil may be up slightly and then to the downside, but distillate is in focus. #gaspricesnl
990 2018-10-09 22:01:45 The Three Day Week is a red herring - it only lasted a few weeks and was basically a response to events outside the UK economy. Workers took industrial action in an effort to maintain wages in the face of inflation driven by the oil shock and the end of Bretton Woods.

1004 2018-10-09 22:00:48 You know what, I'm honestly not sure they did!! Just went on a lot about how weird coconut oil is and how surprising it was that a vegan cake could taste good!
1005 2018-10-09 22:00:41 That’s incredible. I wonder how much longet fares like this will be around with crude oil prices hitting multi-year highs this week.

1011 2018-10-09 22:00:16 I assume it will help about 10% of their production which was acquired this year from Steppe around [The Torquay.]  They are heavy weighted w/ some light oil in Central Alberta, which if unhedged, is selling for around $45 USD.   $GXE differentials will likely be [awful] in Q3.

1013 2018-10-09 22:00:06 Nigeria is a poor country!

Nigeria is a poor country.

I can't say this enough!

We worry about minimum wage,

about a fiscal deficit (costs higher than income),

about oil prices & production volumes...

Have we asked how much we generate per citizen, & what it costs us?
1014 2018-10-09 21:59:48 I’m the kind go friend who won’t go out and party with you but if you need someone to go grocery shopping with or hang with you while you get an oil change I’m there
1015 2018-10-09 21:59:37 As somebody who worked in the oil industry I would like to point out that tax isn't just corporation tax, many jurisdiction level a royalty tax on revenues to generate early tax revenue, be abuse large oil developments have very long periods of cost recovery

1019 2018-10-09 21:59:23 Can you use oil for vegan baking? 
1020 2018-10-09 21:59:18 Venezuela is highly dependent on one commodity - oil - for its export earnings, has huge debts in US $, didn’t invest much in its real economy and is the victim of economic warfare by the US and some of its own corporate sector. It’s irrelevant to discussion of the UK’s position.
1021 2018-10-09 21:59:15 Yes, I again totally agree.  Right now, renewables are in their infancy  and are disrupting traditional energy (ie, coal, gas). The time is now for something to break thru, but every day that goes by is just a day closer to big oil taking over :(
1022 2018-10-09 21:59:10 You may be allergic to almond oil if it’s breaking you out. Have you tried any others?

1030 2018-10-09 21:58:39 Might not help at the moment but maybe get it for the future. Young living oils has this oil called PanAway. It's a wintergreen scent. Rub it on the temple and back of the neck, works for me every time. Neck massages, warm heating pad on the neck & darkness work too. Feel better.

1036 2018-10-09 21:57:58 The central assertion that Polis wants to eliminate the the oil and gas industry is false.

Even if we achieve the admirable goal of 100% renewable energy in Colorado, O&G is exportable and it will always be necessary for manufacturing and industry.  #copolitics #cogov
1037 2018-10-09 21:57:25 Personally i prefer chicken to beef. And better when baked or pan fried.  Less oil that way. Even boiled is good. Veggies can be great when fried together with some rice or even some pasta. 0o0.

1041 2018-10-09 21:57:02 I had an odd dream, where I fell asleep with my oil pen to my side, and woke up with a broken cartridge, and oil all over. Saltiest feeling ever... glad it was only a dream lmfao.
1042 2018-10-09 21:57:02 I see the cpc bots have turned out in droves to defend Brett Wilsons contention that the conservatives built many piplines,but neither Brett nor bot has cited the name of any pipline carrying oil to our overseas customers,cause there aint any.

1044 2018-10-09 21:56:37 Exactly the American way of destabilising other countries' economies. Recently the US is on record warning other nations not to deal with Venezuela on its initiative of Petro which is backed by Venezualan oil reserves.

1046 2018-10-09 21:56:15 Yes. If the perpetrators not prosecuted them it is sending the message that genocide will be tolerated. Also four years on people still languishing in camps and girls missing. Iraq got Kirkuk and its oil wells and the money with them back so maybe they could spend some helping.
1047 2018-10-09 21:56:15 But let’s drill for oil in national parks & the oceans, pollute the air, rivers, lakes everywhere by undoing environmental protection laws...

1050 2018-10-09 21:56:04 No American should have their backyard as a septic tank.  Yet you do vote that way. Coal polluters got your vote because too many regulations. The clean up fund that oil had to contribute too—gone because too many regulations. You are not an environmental guy but for re-election.

"oil, its running out" again 4 words.  

All rubbish, but effective non the less.

1060 2018-10-09 21:55:06 Maybe and not as bad as US where every enclosed space pongs like the cosmetics counter at Myers. Every whiff I get reminds me of ridiculous commercials and names they slap on these things including on women's, e.g. Oil of Cashmere. What part of the goat is that from?

Also, I agree, over paving causes issues, but so does spewing carbon from coal stacks, tearing up land to get oil from the tar sands, driving in our cars, burning down forests, and extracting oil from deserts.

1073 2018-10-09 21:53:04 You didn’t answer the question about palm oil.  Do you use it or not?
1074 2018-10-09 21:52:59 If it makes you feel any better my car takes 8-9 quarts of oil ever time I get it changed.
1075 2018-10-09 21:52:52 That’s fine, we won’t be sending you any tax or proceeds from our oil then. Oh, and you can have your rented US Nuclear warheads back to store somewhere south of the border too

1089 2018-10-09 21:50:47 Used an oil as a sleep aid for a few nights here and there during the summer. It definitely worked but for the cost of the dosage size required to actually help it wasn’t worth it to use regularly.

1095 2018-10-09 21:50:13 Sooo how do I put coconut oil on my lashes without blinding myself??
1096 2018-10-09 21:50:10 Oil your own machine!!! India’s Rape Crisis: 106 Rapes Per Day, 4 in 10 Victims Minors. @TarekFatah this old dog is blind he never see this. Whole day barking against Islam and Pakistan.
1097 2018-10-09 21:50:05 Yes that’s right we are going to be a successful independent country run by a group of MPs who are basing all our revenues on oil - that will really work
1098 2018-10-09 21:50:02 Lentil soup, salad, rosemary olive oil Italian bread
1099 2018-10-09 21:49:29 To much oil in his car,Jelly fish poisoning, Alaskan Eskimo Hep. Smoking Dog. He has been through hell. Next week he will sound like Barry White.
1100 2018-10-09 21:49:29 Why is oil called fossil fuel? Think how many billions of barrels of oil that has been sucked up over th years. Think how many Pre fossil what evers had to die way down deep pits to change into oil over millions of years. Does it really make any sense? Oil is a renewable resource
1101 2018-10-09 21:49:28 早寝する必要もあるから実質削られる時間がでかすぎる
1102 2018-10-09 21:49:26 They then squandered the revenue from north sea oil on unemployment benefit and tax cuts for the rich, while telling us that we didn't need to make things any more and that we'd make a living from services, especially banking (that ended well).
1103 2018-10-09 21:49:22 Eric you sure know about the snake oil you try to sell to the unknowing
1104 2018-10-09 21:49:14 @Coles  you've changed your Buttery Blend. Less butter and more oil, and price up. You think we're stupid and don't notice. It's why I don't shop there anymore. #shifty

1107 2018-10-09 21:48:56 " I have anointed you with HOLY oil and I will not allow The son of the wicked to OUTWIT you. " Sayeth The LORD Of Hosts.
1108 2018-10-09 21:48:52 How about the tax-free agreements that the Labor government signed with resource companies: they take away gas and oil and don't pay taxes because they discount "prospect costs". Dumb deal
1109 2018-10-09 21:48:51 What did you use the oil money for,and the reckless borrowing which made Ghana a highly distressed country.....
1110 2018-10-09 21:48:47 it’s big business and the oil industry that are fucking the planet up but they’ll try to guilt trip you like it’s your fault, because you drove to work instead of taking the bus. like you could actually do fuck all to change things if you tried.
1111 2018-10-09 21:48:46 Educate your own magatass on all the other "socialist" countries. BTW we are close-- Soc. Sec., Medicare, farm and oil subsidies, etc. Healthcare would be half the cost if ins. companies were ELIMINATED! Get a brain.
1112 2018-10-09 21:48:42 Hey Fiona is a bad mf. He said ‘are you sure you’re supposed to have your oil changed. It looks good’
1113 2018-10-09 21:48:24 I was actually thinking of CBD oil, which doesn't alter the mind as the content of cannabis is really low.  I've read quite a bit about it - just can't understand why it isn't legal here - far less harmful than many of the drugs they offer legally.
1114 2018-10-09 21:48:10 Do you have a guide to oil trading? (Disclaimer for liability included of course) but it might be a great way to build some capital for trading basics in oil!
1115 2018-10-09 21:48:07 眠すぎる
1116 2018-10-09 21:47:55 Add a little oil in your marinade to lubricate and add moisture and conduct flavor too. #BBQTips #BBQ #BBQLyfe
1117 2018-10-09 21:47:53 I don’t dilute it even though you’re supposed to lol you could mix it with vitamin E oil
1118 2018-10-09 21:47:51 1 month until election as I predicted Oil prices surging.,Trump cut $$ for solar, froze fuel economy standards, sanctions on Iran. Did Trump say otherwise? Well of course he did, he's a liar. Don't listen to what he says, EVER..watch what he's doing It's all about helping Russia
1119 2018-10-09 21:47:37 Ok I’m settled and catching up with this week’s Bake Off. I love coconut oil. Coconut anything in fact. But not in pastry
1120 2018-10-09 21:47:04 Not super healthy but I like veggie fried rice

Boil rice, let stand to absorb moisture

Heat up oil in skillet or wok (sesame or peanut probably best but I use canola)

Add rice, your choice of veg, soy sauce, sweet chili sauce (or choice of hot sauce) ginger and sautee
1121 2018-10-09 21:47:01 食パンさんおは未来ちゃありです！
1122 2018-10-09 21:46:50 Got it:  Deep Water Horizon.  (the movie about the oil spill).
1123 2018-10-09 21:46:26 Gorilla gel will lay the HELL outta your hair BUT its so bad for it. I just put black castor oil on my hair first and gel it after. it lasted through RAIN!!!
1124 2018-10-09 21:46:21 Liar..... You have x2 of the oil now but still borrowing recklessly including Ghc50bn century bond
1125 2018-10-09 21:46:20 Koch's are in oil, is where their money comes from, so they have their states to tax solar, push war to sell more oil, back weapons industry=war and oil, kill hydrogen cars, kill electric trolly and cars, use money to take over our universities. They are not nice people.
1126 2018-10-09 21:46:14 be careful with the line "ball in your mouth" Katka, there's a double meaning there.  
Did anyone see the movie about the oil spill, can't remember the name.  It was really good.
1127 2018-10-09 21:46:09 Oh no! Which oil did you use and what’s your skin type?
1128 2018-10-09 21:45:54 All libs should ride horses ( no gas or oil or electric) to work in rain, sun or ice. They should make their own cloth on looms ( no electric) after shearing sheep by hand ( no electric.. coal or oil) , they should all use signal flags to communicate long distance ( no phones.
1129 2018-10-09 21:45:45 Bloodroot Essential Oil
1130 2018-10-09 21:45:43 Blue Cohosh Essential Oil
1131 2018-10-09 21:45:33  charcoal face wash & aloe, elf gel liner, eco argon oil & yes, yes it is Ori in the back
1132 2018-10-09 21:45:31 InfoChip is the only custom ID provider focused on providing heavy-duty tags for the #oil & gas markets.
1133 2018-10-09 21:45:19 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
1134 2018-10-09 21:45:19 And maybe enforce regulations on securing the oil rigs in the gulf... but sigh... you really don’t care .
1135 2018-10-09 21:45:15 Boil strawberry and water chestnut in old bay seasoning briefly. Serve with a bit of olive oil.
1136 2018-10-09 21:45:04  get the baby oil

1138 2018-10-09 21:44:54 Salvia does a good job baby oil has chemicals that can harm your vagina and ph
1139 2018-10-09 21:44:45 I got oil on my face again... How does it even get there...? -bot-
1140 2018-10-09 21:44:35 We'll likely be on anti-inflams for a while...and lots of coddly oil and sardines, but will hopefully not need any painkillers thankfully
1141 2018-10-09 21:44:30 I got a drop of fir needle essential oil on my hands and now I reek of a forest
1142 2018-10-09 21:44:30 So who knew you had to change your oil so often. This is bull crap
1143 2018-10-09 21:44:25 And I have 7 days to understand unit 2 genetics. Today I walked into class on CBD oil like “DAMN SON THIS IS A LOT OF SHIT.”
1144 2018-10-09 21:44:21 "The whitest and grooviest things in the world cannot be ingested or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
1145 2018-10-09 21:44:15 Scrambled eggs and fresh avocado on top. Use coconut oil to cook the eggs. Clean and healthy.
1146 2018-10-09 21:44:09 there’s a seasonal pumpkin spice oil change at my mechanics (they can actually do it all year if you just ask)
1147 2018-10-09 21:44:08 Even the major oil companies have recognized there is severe global warming by burning fossil fuels and they knew this back in the 1980s.
1148 2018-10-09 21:44:08 The Swiss Government decided that Palm Oil is too important for Swiss Food Industry.  Too bad Indonesia for the deforestation.
Profits before habitat.
But Trump is Bad 
Thanks for the distraction.
1149 2018-10-09 21:44:00 uhm, compared to pumping out oil and transporting it and refining it until you have diesel or normal gas and everything else concerning a conventional car an ev needs much less energy. Also it has less parts that can break or need to be replaced and no fluids, ergo longer life
1150 2018-10-09 21:43:51 No fooling? We have been warned for some time but hurray for American coal and oil drilling and to hell with the national debt. We must vote these deniers, self entitled greedy politicians out of office and encourage some damned logic in our lawmakers.
1151 2018-10-09 21:43:49 OMG TRUMP LIES HOURLY. TLH. Snake oil salesman.
1152 2018-10-09 21:43:23 Baaaad :(
Started the oil cleansing method about almost 2 months ago, and my skin started to broke out since day two. 
1153 2018-10-09 21:43:18 Another bullshit subsidy for Rich Farmers who are whining about U.S.'s recent shale oil discoveries. Their problem:  OVER-PRODUCTION! & failing to cut back. The problem will only get worse as Electric Cars will require no gasoline; regardless of blend. First Soybeans, now Corn!
1154 2018-10-09 21:43:15 A lot easier with eggs though! And what are the air miles on the coconut oil?
1155 2018-10-09 21:43:05 Must be oil there eh Adolf

1157 2018-10-09 21:42:51 Would be Interested to see why the US did do well? Was this down to oil, reserve currency, increasing middle class.. US brands have bee dominant even in the UK since I can remember, will that remain the case?
1158 2018-10-09 21:42:42 My oil change really be $75 
1159 2018-10-09 21:42:38 Have you tried putting olive oil on the cucumber? Something my mum does, she seems to think it helps
1160 2018-10-09 21:42:31 You know how to change oil on a car?  #StupidQuestionsAtTheDriveThru
1161 2018-10-09 21:42:29 What happened to the $32b this regime met in the treasury and the returned Abacha. Grow up and stop spreading propaganda. Crude oil has been selling over $70/b and this govt has not said anything on what to do with the extra money they are making. Shame!
1162 2018-10-09 21:41:59 so if I put a drop or two of pinesol in my oil diffuser ... am I a psycho 
1163 2018-10-09 21:41:59 Krill oil is supposed to have better bioavailability than fish oil.

Also salmon roe is supposed to be 40% omega 3.
1164 2018-10-09 21:41:51 falling oil revenue.. 28billion this year, better growth in fact better everything... Sick fed up with the likes of you who never has a good word to say about Scotland... negativity all the time.. it's no wonder yer union is failing...
1165 2018-10-09 21:41:49 I took my car to get a simple oil change.... yeahhhhhh apparently that wasn’t all I needed  $40 turned into almost $200 
1166 2018-10-09 21:41:30 2017- Concrete boulder dents my skid plate and oil pan on the Cressida 

2018- Long piece of 4x4 wood bends my wheel and tie rod on the IS300.

CONGRATULATIONS.
1167 2018-10-09 21:41:25 To the average voter that sounds a lot like a levy on oil companies, not a tax on their natural gas stove and vehicle fuel.  If he is wondering why support is running away, perhaps because he was dishonest.
1168 2018-10-09 21:41:17 Omo I can't stop laughing. In the real sense anyone that enters the bills are on the country. PMB didn't even enter, he is already sure of rep seat, now imagine PMB at the VIP, he may not drink a bottle but He may go away with oil well but Atiku a buznez man will only pay & move
1169 2018-10-09 21:41:12 detailed my truck, put on better tires, new balljoints, wheel bearings, and fixed the oil pan heater (?). Feels so good  Getting it aligned next tuesday, and fixed the power steering leak on the orange truck. i love itttt
1170 2018-10-09 21:41:06 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
1171 2018-10-09 21:41:06 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1172 2018-10-09 21:41:03 Leaps and bounds better. Economically you've doubled your returns in 2 years, your gold reserves have gone up, you've lowered your dependency on oil and your taxes are going down.

It really is you just want control, it really doesn't have anything to do with actual fairness.
1173 2018-10-09 21:40:48 I’m washing Marmite jars while business is drilling for oil in Alaska.
1174 2018-10-09 21:40:38 Right on. Plus, he's an elite; last time he farmed, worked the oil patch etc was way b/f he went to Princeton and Harvard-if that. Tell that to MAGA
1175 2018-10-09 21:40:32 They’re not. And baby oil doesn’t make a good lube. Especially with condoms.
1176 2018-10-09 21:40:29 In a skillet. Put a lil oil  n there and itll taste like its off the grill
1177 2018-10-09 21:40:28 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…
1178 2018-10-09 21:40:21 With wind and solar output at 4% of the energy we need,..................... you would be STUPID to immediately cut off coal, oil and hydro.
1179 2018-10-09 21:40:14 And years later we're still trying to get rid of @bcgreens who impede progress, cost us BILLIONS in economics (by not selling oil at world prices to US), support TAXING the crap out of us and then BEG us to keep you in power - which is all you actually seem interested in. Wow eh?
1180 2018-10-09 21:40:10 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。

1183 2018-10-09 21:39:45 And America definitely doesn't have a free market. Half of US discretionary spending is controlled by military contractors in the name of "defense" and "supporting the troops." Oil companies and transporters get all manner of direct and indirect subsidies. not free = inefficient
1184 2018-10-09 21:39:31 Another nail in the biofuels coffin. You and Pruitt continue to fill the oil companies pockets.  Maybe yours as well

1187 2018-10-09 21:39:01 Current account deficit is so huge that foreign remittances not enough 
We import everything and export only raw food items 
Biggest import item is oil and international oil rates are increasing 
Second big factor is military budget
1188 2018-10-09 21:38:57 A small bunch of retired folks shut off all of the tarsands pipelines in the USA by hand in October 2016 (~15% of domestic oil transport) They have since been going to court and attempting to argue a necessity defense for their actions
1189 2018-10-09 21:38:44 I used the recipe from @thehappypear , from their newest cookbook. It was really easy, just roasted garlic, lemon juice, soy milk, olive oil, salt & pepper. I'm happy to post a picture of their recipe if you'd like! Super easy, really quick and made 600g!
1190 2018-10-09 21:38:33 Have you tried genuine CBD oil? It genuinely works wonders with a lot of people :)
1191 2018-10-09 21:38:31 So an ambition, not an achievement. And a bit cheeky when her economic projections are based on exporting oil pollution all over the world. 10 yrs in power, she must have achieved something other than cutting nurse and midwife numbers. Surely?
1192 2018-10-09 21:38:31 Acaba com aquela maconhagem no free oil kk
1193 2018-10-09 21:38:30 Ha. 40% of corn crop goes to fuel but light tight oil from the Permian which is only good for making gasoline (and theoretical energy independence) gets thrown under the bus. Better use? Maybe send the extra crop to countless where people are starving. Just an idea.
1194 2018-10-09 21:38:25 はちこうさんおはごです！
1195 2018-10-09 21:38:21 The article was hilarious. She said “I just wanted to teach him a lesson. I didn’t want to kill him, but the oil got hot an he burned.” 
1196 2018-10-09 21:38:18 Regai tizore hedu cooking oil... Oh wait cooking oil yacho irikunetsa. We are doomed.  Kutongoita shena waya waya...
1197 2018-10-09 21:38:15 I love watching these "chefs" cook fried eggs on #Chopped constantly without butter or oil and then complaining the eggs stick. Seriously?
1198 2018-10-09 21:38:13 What if i come in and do this. Will u personally change my oil
1199 2018-10-09 21:38:12 Yes, I kept my receipt, and I might keep it two months, two years, or twenty years, so a little heads-up to all of the shifty snake oil salespeople: don't feel too comfortable. #thoughtoftheday
1200 2018-10-09 21:38:10 I still need an oil change guys ...

1207 2018-10-09 21:37:43 As I said “in large part”. I had made a life decision that I didn’t wanna just give away $ to whoever (oil companies, govt, etc) & knowing I was lowering my foot print felt good too. In that regard the CT was an easy transition but it did provide inspiration to go further than B4
1208 2018-10-09 21:37:38 I underestimated that oil on my eggs,I’m cooked!!
1209 2018-10-09 21:37:37 I like to eat my CBD oil wbu? 
1210 2018-10-09 21:37:34 “I was driving back to the motel from a hunt and I must’ve hit some ice or an oil patch or something. Spun out, slammed passenger side first into a tree.” She shrugs. “Dislocated my shoulder, cut my lip and I had bruised ribs. But the car came off worse.”

1213 2018-10-09 21:36:59 @NCUSCR It appears that China and Russia are tag-teaming support to North Korea to keep it afloat providing oil, etc. despite UN sanctions. How should the U.S. respond?
1214 2018-10-09 21:36:52 I'm still waiting of Al Gorleone's predicted doomsday. The rapture was supposed to happen on September 13, 1988⏤what happened? Guess his payoff to the masseuses for the happy ending hand jobs he receives has drained⏤beside him!⏤his bank account, so he is back snake oil selling
1215 2018-10-09 21:36:48 Snake oil.
1216 2018-10-09 21:36:35 @bennyavni Even if Khashoggi is alive and well, Saudi Arabia is a not an example of a nation we want or need as an ally. At best they only patronize America, they are never looking out for anything but preserving their fundamentalist monarchy and pump oil
1217 2018-10-09 21:36:34 May be peripheral to Building H, but tantalizing suggestions that merely supplanting some fraction of oils typically used in fast food frying (frequently soy oil) with refined/pure olive oil, or less costly oils like canola or peanut - could convey a significant health benefit.
1218 2018-10-09 21:36:33 Rainforests are torn down for palm oil farms and it’s a massive loss of habitat it particularly affects orangutans and they’re often dying due to it
1219 2018-10-09 21:36:10 'Someone's mum just got her pension after 24yrs. From 2010-2014,Nig earned $381.9bn from crude oil alone & pensioners were left to die without enjoying the fruits of their labor.We used to hear of pensioners dying in queues.
And some crackheads are telling u of incompetence' Soul

1224 2018-10-09 21:35:46 Acne itself is not caused by bacteria. It can be, but not usually. For the most part it’s overactive sebaceous glands in the hair follicles. That’s why the best soaps for acne are not necessary antibacterial - they are more aimed towards reducing the oil on your skin.

1232 2018-10-09 21:35:10 It really depends on what kind of pain you have. Hemp oil is NOT snake oil. There have been lots of clinical studies done that have determined the many benefits of Hemp Oil. All products come with a 60 day money back guarantee if you aren't happy.
1233 2018-10-09 21:35:02 Wouldn’t it make sense that the #oil prices are up in $USD if more #crude is being sold outside the #Dollar putting pressure and causing inflation. Sort if like the downward effect on paper #gold due to physical pressure? @realroguenews

1236 2018-10-09 21:34:47 Stop the bullshit. Ndc took over from NPP in 2009 a country that president Kuffuor had brought out of hipc and IMF oppression. He discovered oil for Ghana as well and left the cedi dollar rate at $1 to 1cedi 12 pesewas. Gave us many social interventions.

1241 2018-10-09 21:34:15 That’s the problem with you @realDonaldTrump supporters, you’re about as smart as him (which puts all of you at about 5th grade). That’s exactly how he conned everyone of you with his bs and lies. He’s a “snake oil” salesman and you bought it hook, line, and sinker. Smh.

1245 2018-10-09 21:34:00 Our community values the environment and deserves a champion for our air, water, and beaches, not another vote for big oil. We must preserve this planet for our kids and the generations to come.

1256 2018-10-09 21:32:31 Well acne is caused by bacteria, so certain antibiotics target those bacteria. I forget the details but Accutane instead targets the cells that secrete oil and tries to suppress that function iirc. It dried my skin and hair when I took it but it's gotten 'better' since I stopped.
1257 2018-10-09 21:32:31 Of course we are de-commissioning old oil wells
We can’t leave them lying around, a hazard to shipping, when they’re played out!

Awash with oil and gas west of Shetland though!!
Massive finds!

Mr. Successful Businessman Trump doesn't get.

The US could make HUGE $$$ off new energy strategies: solar, wind, water,  & new technologies.

But Trump's oil/coal "friends" and solar panel tariffs get in the way. 
Get DJT's attn via $$$.

1266 2018-10-09 21:31:27 Oil changed in the SVX, also the passenger window regulator has been changed out.   Still have the two rears to do however.    Heads for Totoro are back in the machine shop and so far they say no charge and should be done by the end of the week.
1267 2018-10-09 21:31:22 Slightly productive day. @greylopht and I removed the heads from Totoro's motor and dropped them off at the machine shop to be fixed. Then changed the oil and replaced a window regulator in the SVX.

1276 2018-10-09 21:30:15 Replace all coal/gas/oil power with nuclear and halt most solar/wind development once the nukes are up and running.  Once electricity costs subsequently plummet, mass-electrification of road and rail traffic now becomes economical.
1277 2018-10-09 21:30:12 That’ll be $79.99 a bottle. And we only sell three-bottle packs. It will look and smell a lot like olive oil with flowers cut up into it. Don’t let that bug ya...It’s not, I promise...

Do you have no idea the volume of oil that comes out the North Sea?

1285 2018-10-09 21:29:45 Assad CREATED the evil of ISIS & has a symbiotic relationship with them, rarely directly attacking them, buying oil from them, bussing them from Yarmouk to #Sweida & allowing them massacre locals there.....
1286 2018-10-09 21:29:42 Good one. All the oil company would have to do is drop a 20 cent discount on the day of the boycott and they'll be so busy they'd probably run out of fuel @BP_NewZealand @zenergynz @CaltexNZ
1287 2018-10-09 21:29:41 But we dont have a true free market that prices in costs/value of things. This is especially true in our debt based monetary system and is exacerbated by the regulatory capture that oil and car industries now have on govt regulations
Govt subsidizes oil more than renewables - why

1302 2018-10-09 21:28:36 Folks, we haven't forgotten our China crude oil inventory report. We aim to publish it this week. As said, we have identified 1.4 billion barrels of storage space, spread over 3500 floating rooftop storage tanks. It took us 2 months to manually catalog. STAY TUNED! #OOTT
1303 2018-10-09 21:28:36 Add oil
1304 2018-10-09 21:28:35 The 'seven sisters' intrigued me. It was the collective name of seven multinational oil companies which dominated the global market until the mid-1970s. It is also a good description for Rochdale's seven towers. My memory of Rochdale is of its marvellous Gothic revival town hall.
1305 2018-10-09 21:28:32 Kinda sad the US spent so much blood and sweat trying to control the world’s oil supply only to have climate change render that strategic asset increasingly worthless with time. Goes to show how there is no plan immune to unknown unknowns.

1311 2018-10-09 21:28:01 Yes, exactly. Lavender by itself makes me nauseated, and strong smells give me migraines so. The oil definitely did not get rid of my pre-existing headache.

On the plus side, 3 days later my skin has finally stopped feeling like it's burning

1324 2018-10-09 21:26:57 I wish people took mayo on an italian sub as seriously as they take pineapple on pizza. Mayo mixing in with oil and vinegar is significantly worse than any flavor conflict on hawaiian pizza.
1325 2018-10-09 21:26:50 Stay on the fight.  No new RIN credits for refiners. Big Oil will only blend ethanol when their feet are held to the fire.
1326 2018-10-09 21:26:46 This also means no war in syria, iran, russia, no war with anyone. end these wars for empire & oil. we know israel illegally occupies syrias golan heights & started war with & framed syria. isis is israel & usa must stop working for genie energy cfr aipac cufi foreign agents.
1327 2018-10-09 21:26:46 Sorry I don’t think gradualist is the answer we are on the cusp of massive climate change that  probably can’t be reversed - mining oil is fine but sequestering CO2 has to be in the bargain
1328 2018-10-09 21:26:34 Why is your thought process so last century? Why are we even still on the oil standard? Sending billions upon billions of American $'s to countries that hate us. You're not a leader, you're a bought & paid for follower.
1329 2018-10-09 21:26:31 Where the oil cartridges @ ?
1330 2018-10-09 21:26:29 I didn't tell U, I needed some machine oil & it seemed I'd misplaced it. I jovially call Raven not expecting anything. Well wadya no? It appeared on the table outside while I looked inside!Freaked me right out I've just got over the shock.

1334 2018-10-09 21:25:50 USA. & etc kept treating us like craps bcs our leaders are ignorance. Nigeria is very important to the global community & the globalist in the areas of shared interest such as oil, regional peace  etc.  Our leaders must  stand up to them  & be bold
A globalists trained me to know
1335 2018-10-09 21:25:46 Saudi’s told us they wouldn’t let glut return.  Assuming now they are more comfortable at 9.7 then 10.7 and expect them to swing here with capex being down so far and nothing coming on if high oil did create a recession.  Economy is addicted to cheap energy, withdrawals likely.
1336 2018-10-09 21:25:44 Hahaha, baby oil as lube!!! I cannot!!
1337 2018-10-09 21:25:40 my fave part of the climate 'debate' is maga chuds stating scientists are lying about it to get more funding. meanwhile, oil companies have absolutely nothing to gain from maintaining the status quo.
1338 2018-10-09 21:25:35 Oh are you another hypocrite that flys around the country protesting oil? Your footprint is bigger than mine.
1339 2018-10-09 21:25:35 Very inefficient and very messy! Plus vast oil reserves are so biodegraded that they can’t be extracted with conventional methods.
1340 2018-10-09 21:25:30 jus use the baby oil instead
1341 2018-10-09 21:25:28 So no one should have a nice boat that puts many people to work building that boat Ezra? Socialists, against every historical example, most recently Venezuela with lotsa oil still stick to the idiocy
1342 2018-10-09 21:25:24 Everytime I think of oil spillage and freedom college my appreciation for Duncan mighty soars higher
1343 2018-10-09 21:25:16 #pnpcbc as usual the Cons have no plan for climate action. Just sell more oil.
1344 2018-10-09 21:25:09 i got oil on my arm
1345 2018-10-09 21:24:40 Not to mention proper accounting of resources to process immigration cases. Since 1992 average processing time is 7 years min non special case. We only have 250 office processing. Maybe if the oil was in countries with high univ ration rates to US this might have been avoided.
1346 2018-10-09 21:24:38 ありぴか～
1347 2018-10-09 21:24:27 I think the real question is why is he spending all that time buying it and not using it. Or is old spice saying their oil lasts such a short amount of time you have to order it constantly
1348 2018-10-09 21:24:20 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Take the ethanol initiative further. Take the oil out of our e85. This was bestowed upon #WeThePeople by #Standardoil. #MAGA LET OUR CARS RUN OFF OUR OWN FUEL THAT WE PRODUCE. #Trump #maga #ethanol #e85 #Fuel #AmericaFirst
1349 2018-10-09 21:24:13 Benefits of EVs are no oil changes, not needing to change breaks as often, but we forget about the other issues.
Especially when parts are scarce like Tesla
1350 2018-10-09 21:24:13 Our city’s sirens just went off! They didn’t tell us we were going to have a test. We are surrounded by chemical plants, oil plants and off shore rigs and military ports. I don’t know to look for bombers, toxic clouds or a explosion or a tornado. LOL!
1351 2018-10-09 21:24:08 Get some tea tree oil or lavender oil and keep it handy. I swear by it!

1354 2018-10-09 21:23:54 So why is AB fighting with BC. They are both NDP. And Notley upset a lot of eastern NDP by defending the oil and gas industry. Your rhetoric doesn’t jive with reality
1355 2018-10-09 21:23:39 China is replacing both coal and solar with nuclear energy now.

The USA could develop clean reactors. This would naturally end coal, oil, gas, and solar/wind.

The IPCC report is a crock of shit. It does not even consider nuclear energy.

Hemp+vertical farming=more pasture land.
1356 2018-10-09 21:23:37 Reminder: American republicans are the only conservatives ON THE ENTIRE PLANET who doubt climate change. It's not an ideological issue. It's a "we're getting paid by Big Oil to pretend this isn't a problem so we can fill our pockets" issue.
1357 2018-10-09 21:23:33 I think the governments plan is to sell your family land to  to pay the  owed.

History has shown, it's happened before with big oil, and native land.
1358 2018-10-09 21:23:32 The sad part is the original study was conducted in the 70’s!!!!! We had like 50 years to fix this but nope the oil and agriculture industry just had to make billions :))))
1359 2018-10-09 21:23:17 I fuckin love pro glow/matte. I thinkkk it’s maybelline? Alsooo I have combo skin too and I’ve been mixing vitamin e oil with my vitamin c moisturizer and holy shit. My skin is completely different now.
1360 2018-10-09 21:23:15 100 million dollars in fake oil in Trinidad and Tobago and nobody has been charged or are before the courts presently only in Trinidad and Tobago no where else is the world these things happens
1361 2018-10-09 21:23:07 Socialism doesn't end that way, communism does, but everything falls once USA brings in regime change, even democratic ones go to rubble; children strave, disease spreads, clean water gone; due to US sanctions. USA does this then my oil/energy stocks go up; good 4 me; bad 4 them.
1362 2018-10-09 21:22:51 Nothing great for anyone working, the retired doing ok and those on social welfare benefit for doing nothing. Tbtg the petrol/diesal and home heating oil didn't go up. Workers got less from this budget AGAIN
1363 2018-10-09 21:22:49 It’s better than coal or oil fired plants, for sure.
1364 2018-10-09 21:22:37 My worry is people are gearing up to to produce cannabis oil for those plastic things that people are all walking about puffing on
1365 2018-10-09 21:22:32 I saw Kenneth today... Eksu Geology guys can relate. Damn Oil company shot good o choi
1366 2018-10-09 21:22:30 @NicolaSturgeon seems strange that you’re desperate for independence from the UK, but want to be governed by Brussels? There’ll be no going back when the oil runs out and you need bailing out, be careful what you wish for.
1367 2018-10-09 21:22:22 One is soon to be an organization of felons and the other is a giant snake oil container. If you’ve done your research you will know which is each. No tips please
1368 2018-10-09 21:22:18 @jkenney climate change is real!  Get with the program. It's like an oil change: "You can pay me now, or you can pay me later"
1369 2018-10-09 21:22:17 The solution to climate change is conceptually very easy. 

We need to leave most of the remaining coal oil and gas in the ground. 

Two things make that seem hard.
1370 2018-10-09 21:22:14 we, as humanity, could try to abolish all of this largely.

all these terrible accidents, flammable gas in people's homes, heavy, polluting industrial operations in peoples BY, all the leaks & explosions & blowouts could be reduced to a minimum if we "just" abolished oil & gas.
1371 2018-10-09 21:22:12 assholes opening oil fields and refusing to stop. you people really are the end of the world.
1372 2018-10-09 21:22:12 Oh he’s bananas. I think I’ll be getting my rose hip oil elsewhere.
1373 2018-10-09 21:22:11 Lol the good thing about that ke gore a itsi go itshwara,,. Go berekisa mala ka dicastor oil etc has no therefore wanthola 
1374 2018-10-09 21:21:53 Money trail is why they won't be efficient. Big oil will significantly influence any climate legislation. I'd rather just have government cut a check to innovaters and manufacturers with the caveat of a time frame for compliance with new energy regs backed by stiff penalties.
1375 2018-10-09 21:21:47 Just now realized that my driver side seatbelt is encrusted with unspeakable years of skin oil and grime to the point where it is no longer factory color and my passenger side one is pristine. No, no I do not have any friends.
1376 2018-10-09 21:21:46 Im sure FEMA will be concentrated around Mar Y Lago, when that den of golf sin gets hit hard maybe Trump will acknowledge global warming.? . Probably not, cause his pecker is dipped in oil.
1377 2018-10-09 21:21:44 Coconut oil and Aunty Jackie’s is the answer, your hair will be safe 
1378 2018-10-09 21:21:33 It may not take that long w/ a starting point that is at the lowest levels ever in GDP, housing/auto data, real wages + highest debts everywhere, little/no savings, many workers w/ 2 jobs, high oil & tradewar. Also a global meltdown. Is underway. This time it may be different
1379 2018-10-09 21:21:31 I do not know how I have gotten anything done between Trump and everything else. But i hear you on the total creative breakdown. non-reactive CBD oil has helped with my insomnia greatly.

1386 2018-10-09 21:21:04 The fact that Dana's a surfer who's both pro-offshore oil drilling and a climate denier is downright mystifying.
1387 2018-10-09 21:20:55 Oil creates nice tax money, you know!
1388 2018-10-09 21:20:55 The crazy thing about that scenario is that it will actually make the supply fundamentals stronger on the other side. CAPEX will be cut, again, as liquidity squeezes and oil sells off. Basically solidifying another major run in oil. >$100, <$40, >$150 is how I see it.
1389 2018-10-09 21:20:49 I pretty much eat the same I just cut sugar and carbs and added dairy and oil
1390 2018-10-09 21:20:46 Kanye will fill some more oil into Trumps well oiled Machine.
1391 2018-10-09 21:20:45 Yesterday he found out you have to put oil in car engine
1392 2018-10-09 21:20:36 Postwar social democracy,which was mostly pleasant&easy to live in,rested on the fiction of continued Western dominance. In 73 US failure in Vietnam emboldened Arab nations to punish the West(for supporting Israel)with the oil shock.More than any other 1 event,this killed S.D.

1394 2018-10-09 21:20:35 also FUCK the coal/oil industries for spreading false propaganda about measure G, everyone go vote yes for the love of god
1395 2018-10-09 21:20:32 U r 100% right, but it's truth tht our fm sir took credit of their policy as reason wen mkt was at high then they should tke credit fr fall too. There is no point in blaming global prob of oil, or other stuff if we had mde few wrong hasty structural decision frm last few mnth
1396 2018-10-09 21:20:30 Ted Cruz has a very troubling record of voting to put money in his own pocket.

Ted Cruz has taken 2.7 Million dollars from oil and gas interests.  All the while denying overwhelming science regarding climate change and driving our planet off a cliff.  Time for a change.
1397 2018-10-09 21:20:29 . and a lot of potential to be a reputation destroyer . maybe not quite #Sochi 2.0 but a great opportunity for call out IOC corruption and for billionaire eco-foundations to attack 'Calgary for dirty oil' .

1400 2018-10-09 21:20:25 It was nothing to do with oil.

It's to do with almost all political leaders across Europe having been paid vast bribes to support the flooding of Europe with muslims & Africans, to Islamify it.

Theresa May & every previous US Prime Minister starting with Blair is signed-up.
1401 2018-10-09 21:20:23 I thought our oil prices would be cheaper by now. Why not ?
1402 2018-10-09 21:20:21 Mom gave me a vitamin pack this morning and, little did I know, it had a fish oil pill. 
1403 2018-10-09 21:20:15 Just a vegetable oil or rapeseed oil
1404 2018-10-09 21:20:14 Democrats have been telling us for years that people that work for oil companies and health insurance companies are evil. But I'm sure you have no problem with that???
1405 2018-10-09 21:20:13 Perhaps if people saw the really big polluters, like Big Oil, the MIC and the 1% making some sacrifices they'd be less bitter about it.

1424 2018-10-09 21:17:41 Agreed. And if she's serious stop export of coal 13x worse than oil. Send our engineers to assist them in reductions. Wouldn't or shouldn't we act globally on this? 80 20 rule.
1425 2018-10-09 21:17:32 AZ can lead the way to true energy independence for the U.S., as long as we rely on the middle east oil we will always be beholden to foreign powers. Isn't getting the U.S. off of foreign energy sources that the Ultimate patriotism?

1432 2018-10-09 21:16:32 I work as a union sprinkler fitter and we use a lot of articulating lifts that run on diesel. We also use a lot of machines that run through gallons of oil a year. I think it would be a smart idea to look into alternative power sources for construction equipment. Just a thought.
1433 2018-10-09 21:16:28 With the way these gas prices be might have to start running vegetable  oil in my car. 
1434 2018-10-09 21:16:28 Yes!! I’ll bring my oil book!
1435 2018-10-09 21:16:22 The voters the new ND voter ID law hurts the most are the GOP leaning seasonal & temporary oil workers who tend to have out of state. ND has no voter registration (anyone can show up on election day and vote) & this is more about parochial concerns rather than partisan ones.
1436 2018-10-09 21:16:16 And if anything grows, while you pose, I'll oil you up and rub you down down down down
1437 2018-10-09 21:16:12 I feel you!  My boyfriend said that CBD oil will help. Some people take it for sleep and for pain and anxiety depression a whole bunch of stuff.
1438 2018-10-09 21:16:12 I am actually pleasantly surprised as well. I hear it among the EV community of course, but I def didn’t expect a powertool maker and an analyst for oil stocks to use it. I believe this means quite a lot for Tesla’s brand, if any. 
1439 2018-10-09 21:16:09 My wife bought a decorative straw broom "infused with cinnamon oil."

1443 2018-10-09 21:15:31 So today I learnt there’s a lot you can do with Margarine ,in fact ,Margarine is a perfect substitute for cooking oil .Growing up I knew you could use margarine to fry an egg or even cook vegetables but today I learnt you can actually use it to cook (prepare) your pop corn.

1450 2018-10-09 21:14:39 Apples to oranges. A gay couple not getting a cake from baker isn't nearly the same as a snake oil salesman being told he isn't welcomed anymore. The internet has collectively said Alex Jones isn't welcome here anymore. Big damn difference.

1456 2018-10-09 21:13:55 OMG.  @realDonaldTrump is helping coal and hard rock mining and Timber but not the US independent oil companies.  Pushing for lower oil prices will kill millions of jobs and cost US billions in revenues.   Cost Montana $160 million in tax revenues each year. #mtpol #maga
1457 2018-10-09 21:13:54 I don’t know who needs to hear this but.... you need to get an oil change

1463 2018-10-09 21:13:18 Jollof rice... Might not be the real. Jollof... Maybe something close to concussion and fish
Rice.... Half Congo 300
Power oil...... 60
Tomato paste:80 
Pepper:50
Onion :20
Curry and thyme :50
Maggi, salt:50
Fish... Maybe 300 naira

1464 2018-10-09 21:13:02 My understanding is that oil companies also get government subsides.  We also subsidize it with excessive military force to protect our oil supply.
1465 2018-10-09 21:13:01 I think the ideology itself was corrupted/abandoned by Maduro grabbing power. There are several factors in play inc Maduro, oil prices, sanctions, government spending all played a role.

Sweden/Denmark are perhaps a better example!

1471 2018-10-09 21:12:27 Agree seem make sense to raise budget rule oil bar from $40 to$45 & would free more spend cash. But here russia super cautious as very reluctant to mess with mechanism that given it bacon saving $460bn in reserves &one of lowest external debt in world. Makes rus sanction proof.

1479 2018-10-09 21:11:34 PSA: do NOT use baby oil for sexual activities. baby oil is petroleum based & should never be put inside your vagina. first of all, it’s hard to wash out. second of all, it can change your ph balance & put you at higher risk for infections. 

love yourself pls.

1485 2018-10-09 21:10:53 This is interesting. I've been looking at synthetic methane as a comparison with LNG prices, but that's challenging just based on efficiency and the input price of power, not to mention the cost of electrolyzers. Fuel oil/gasoline cost more per MMBtu, so may be easier to compete.

1488 2018-10-09 21:10:42 Soooooooo...two book discussions up tomorrow.  McCarteny’s TEAPOT DOME SCANDAL in Oil and @dmcguire13’s DARK END OF THE STREETS in Civil Rights. How much of the 75 minute meetings will actually end up focused on the history rather than the present?
1489 2018-10-09 21:10:42 I would stop buying Saudi oil!
1490 2018-10-09 21:10:27 It’s that Canadian Baby oil
1491 2018-10-09 21:10:21 DeBlasio's failures are an extension of that mindset: the problem is all Big Oil and not at all citizen demands for abundant parking and unfettered car access
1492 2018-10-09 21:10:09 Ce sont des lâches ! Moi au Pouvoir en RDC, je quitterai ce machin pour créer OIL, Organisation Internationale d la Lingalaphonie. SG : Joseph Kabira. Donc ils cautionnent Rouise Mushikiwa, une rwandophone pour manager les francophones, pour dire que ceux-ci sont des nuls. Triste

1495 2018-10-09 21:09:58 Driving your car fresh after an oil change > sex
1496 2018-10-09 21:09:58 i got an oil change today. i’m such an adult
1497 2018-10-09 21:09:44 @nutrition_facts Hi I’m just wondering if flaxseed oil is ok instead of ground flaxseed?
1498 2018-10-09 21:09:35 You could invest in oil and also make money.
1499 2018-10-09 21:09:31 That’s water not oil
1500 2018-10-09 21:09:29 Yes follow the dollar. And also making the arabs poorer. The more oil we use - the happier they are
1501 2018-10-09 21:09:21 You are right. Like Venezuela produces oil, we create dollars.  By definition, a country that creates dollars can’t go bankrupt if its obligations are denominated in dollars. So stop worrying about it.
1502 2018-10-09 21:09:15 The latest dollar increase is almost worldwide... indian rupee hit record 74... it has nothing to do with our economy... say thanks to trade wars globally and oil price pressures
1503 2018-10-09 21:09:08 Winter storage $400 includes: Oil Change, Battery upkeep, stable, end of season clean up. You can call  any time to get your bike out for a nice day with a heads up!
1504 2018-10-09 21:09:05 Wow 4.6% increase in ship traffic!  And how about carbon pollution and oil (risk of spills) to the local water?  @AJWVictoriaBC @jjhorgan @JustinTrudeau - dont we need to study to CAP carbon and to save the whale population because of this?  Where are the protests?
1505 2018-10-09 21:09:04 Barack Obama calmly presided over police brutally crushing a protest to a giant tar sands pipeline he backed over the anguish of environmentalists, he backed fracking, he backed offshore oil exploration. Big Oil has captured *both* parties.
1506 2018-10-09 21:08:49 my skin is like 10 times softer ever since I started using olive oil as a moisturizer whew
1507 2018-10-09 21:08:45 Well, we've tried that for more than a decade now. How do you think it works? We're burning more oil than ever before now!
1508 2018-10-09 21:08:42 กูไม่ได้ชาร์ตพวบไว้ให้มึงเอาเล่นเกมไง ไอ่น้องเหี้ย
1509 2018-10-09 21:08:31 why do i subject myself to the psychological torture that is oil painting
1510 2018-10-09 21:08:26 I like the merit of wondering if it's a system thing.
1511 2018-10-09 21:08:20 While our students burn midnight oil, looking for the value of X and cramming postulated theories of people who had long gone, Other students within developed nations are learning how to invent new theories and changing the narrative of our history.
1512 2018-10-09 21:08:16 Leaving aside the complex and separate question of gas-fired power and electricity infra... I suspect the availability of decent returns outside the oil patch (not just in junk bonds) will be a key factor.
1513 2018-10-09 21:08:15 Edibles regulation has certainly been the most problematic part so far here. It's a lot harder to regulate than plants or even just oil.
1514 2018-10-09 21:07:52 U min rubber to carry anointing oil
1515 2018-10-09 21:07:44 PLEASE I'm also in need of ewa agoyin, man is not feeling fine. Where can Someone get ewa agoyin in Abuja not beans and oil.. I mean EWA AGOYIN
1516 2018-10-09 21:07:43 Boiled oil and ponmo
1517 2018-10-09 21:07:40 @Crypto_Storm @cryptodemedici @Mitlear And a fucking cleaner/healthier life as a result of ditching fossil fuels.

Another plus would likely be (my hypothesis) less war in the world as renewable energy is more evenly distributed than oil. Oil has really fucked up this planet.

1521 2018-10-09 21:06:52 Meanwhile Turkey has been buying oil from ISIS.

Your point?

Have Israel hidden who they hired to procure the oil? Ah yeah right... Back to Far Left anti-Israeli conspiracies.
1522 2018-10-09 21:06:46 I don't particularly feel bad about areas losing oil jobs but I do sympathize with small business owners getting crushed by regulation.
1523 2018-10-09 21:06:38 Current prices:
Gasoline ~ $2.15/gal
#Ethanol ~ $1.25/gal 
Do the math.
Oil companies fight #E15 because competition from ethanol lowers their prices. Their other anti-ethanol "concerns" are 
1524 2018-10-09 21:06:35 mr president this new zim of yours is painful.yet yo ministers  tell us tht shortages are due to panic buyng, are we panic buyng medicines &fuel too? musadaro inzwaiwo tsitsi-cookng oil $15 in sme plces z tht ok 4 u? plz knw whts on th ground
1525 2018-10-09 21:06:26 yeah, sure.  I own a small business in WA and embrace this initiative.  Nice shilling for the oil companies, there....
1526 2018-10-09 21:06:19 Waterworld would have the advantage that Zuckerberg and the Koch family would drown in their mob proof luxury converted missile silos. I'm very keen on a dystopia where the oil executives and tech billionaires who thought they would sit it out on their remote estates die early.
1527 2018-10-09 21:06:19 @ogporkster and inside Lucas oil says the house Peyton built sooooo I’d say he is a colt for life
1528 2018-10-09 21:06:18 You should listen to the bass line on Midnight Oil’s, Stand in Line.
1529 2018-10-09 21:06:17 I'm worried about the squiggly line in my eye ~ every time I try looking at it, it's gone. Just mocks me mostly
1530 2018-10-09 21:06:10 Nice factoid.

How about some info about when fuel shortages are expected, or if gouging on home heating oil is occurring yet?
1531 2018-10-09 21:06:08 Oh man ... misunderstanding continues. I was asked why I brought up Talbot, I didn't ask why you did. An Oiler fan was hammering Smith for his save percentage I pointed out Talbot is .846. Sorry for my part in the confusion.
1532 2018-10-09 21:06:06 Went into Crown Hyundai for an oil change & they went ahead and gave Breezy a bath & vacuumed her without asking  #okayiseeyou
1533 2018-10-09 21:05:56 So long, and thanks for all the boiling oil.
1534 2018-10-09 21:05:54 um thanks but i'm good. i understand how unconventional oils are extracted. what i did not understand is how anyone could pretend "canadian crude" is cleaner than any conventional oil.

1541 2018-10-09 21:05:09 Picking up some ingredients today. Throne Traditional Barbershop in portland is stocking up on beard balm and beard oil.
1542 2018-10-09 21:05:08 That time of year when olbas oil and vicks has become my best friend 
1543 2018-10-09 21:05:07 That makes sense probably has and affect but I feel like there’s other things that would destroy the earth faster and will no matter what even if we did cut down like the big oil company’s and fossil fuels and the big factories and emissions but bet link me dawg
1544 2018-10-09 21:05:03 Sorry, I don’t understand this tweet either. But I’m done. Have things to do. It’s good to discuss and learn. E.g., you said oil company margins on their cost have increased from 7 to 16%. Have u a reference for that. I suspect refining margins are up.....
1545 2018-10-09 21:04:55 When US companies refine oil, for example, you can have a government step in and tell them to cut it out with the pollution, or make required changes, or whatever. When the government is refining oil, there's nobody to tell them that.
1546 2018-10-09 21:04:53 Getting my oil changed and there's a girl here named sierra with short, blonde hair in a lil pink floral dress. Am I obligated to fight her in hand to hand combat?

1548 2018-10-09 21:04:48 Yes, I do concur with your observations. We built our nation as well as contributing heavily in developing Arab states.Oil exploration commenced in 1930.They first struck oil in Bahrain following Kuwait in1948. However Arab supremacy is expressed in terms Arab and Ajam when used.
1549 2018-10-09 21:04:43 And for sure it's possible that his style (pressure) creates breakdowns that put too much onus on the goaltender to bale out. But his four years in Carolina was on NHL average for xSV% so if that stat holds water his system is fine. This year it's .900 though.
1550 2018-10-09 21:04:40 Your ignorance is staggering”Scottish ports unreliable because of weather”Do you actually know how many oil assets  come in and out of Scotland’s ports every day of the week
1551 2018-10-09 21:04:37 You were talking about a villager, a stark illiterate, someone working in an oil coy can't  be dumb you know

1553 2018-10-09 21:04:28 There’s a product called Bio Oil that can help minimize scarring. I’ve used it several times on myself and my boys. Definitely worth a try! My son had stitches near his eye and it worked wonders.
1554 2018-10-09 21:04:26 Well Car manafactures and Oil moguals kept electric cars silent up until the last 2 or 3 years so as they could get rich

1557 2018-10-09 21:04:18 me:
my forehead: welcome to oil city
1558 2018-10-09 21:04:10 Why not ask PDP that wasted 16yrs doing nothing...years that would have been excellent to at least put in massive infrastructure. luckily we had good income from oil during those yrs...but they were busy stealing. Now our pple want infrastructure in 4yrs..isn't that stupidity?
1559 2018-10-09 21:04:09 Whatever it is! Get it over with! Showing up,just to picket,protest! Is also is slowing the process of giving an,all clear!this exactly why I want no part of anything natural gas! Give me oil,electric any day!

1561 2018-10-09 21:04:03 Very true
1562 2018-10-09 21:03:55 I'm no expert but I handle oil and gas leases daily, I'll read the lease and give you my opinion. DM me
1563 2018-10-09 21:03:52 Why bring him in? I have tweeted a lot about him. Fact is Oilers sv% hasn't been around .900 for four years like Carolina. Talbot had two good years, then bad last year. But why even mention him. This was about a new coach, but same trend, albeit very early...
1564 2018-10-09 21:03:50 Work with us? That's BS. We kiss up to them because we need their oil and they buy our weapons.
1565 2018-10-09 21:03:43 Fuck CBD oil, just go get faded. Lmao
1566 2018-10-09 21:03:42 If Sabathia gets tossed tonight by Hernandez, that's on Boone.    You're mixing oil and water in an elimination game when you're not forced to.
1567 2018-10-09 21:03:15 That's your spec... I get, I'm just seeing things from other perspective. So you're saying, a good looking guy that works as a steel fabricator in one of the oil coys with very good pay, that has only technical Ed qualification...wont make it to your spec?
1568 2018-10-09 21:03:04 Y6 today showed huge #curiosity when investigating the structure of human blood! Who knew syrup, oil, milk and red food colouring could be so scientific? Great reasoning and discussion shown - well done.   
1569 2018-10-09 21:03:03 Zion is both small & the red rock is incredibly delicate. It’s bordered by Uranium, coal, oil, & natural gas mining - which was part of the Bear Ears controversy. UT is heartbreaking in general because it’s so pretty, but the state gov’t is anti-environmental in every way.
1570 2018-10-09 21:02:50 If you donate $25 or more to #Cruz4Texas he will send you miracle water from the Jordan river.

Donate $50 or more and receive your special Mercer-blessed anointing oil.
1571 2018-10-09 21:02:49 Oil form them is like national debt for us.  This country keeps borrowing money and more money to pay for  social services well end up like venezuela.
1572 2018-10-09 21:02:44 I’ll explain, the machines used to extract the oil run on a combination of Diesel & electricity, less on the diesel more on the electricity.  It’s less emissions than the city of Los Angelas puts out in a day.The primarily emissions come from extraction process which uses water.
1573 2018-10-09 21:02:42 You know in the overall scheme of things this is not that important. .                                                                   That said a dinner knife and good stir will blend the oil back into the peanut butter.

1575 2018-10-09 21:02:24 The oil and natural gas industry are doing great. Least amount of unemployment in over a decade. I’m not a trump supporter but he has helped more than Obama and I love Obama! Quit complaining about jobs that u don’t have bc you don’t want to work at a low paying job.
1576 2018-10-09 21:02:15 Peterson and Manne are both selling snake oil and running to the bank with it. Why does anyone care about his rhetoric and her satire?
1577 2018-10-09 21:02:12 the beard oil has SLICKENED your relationship
1578 2018-10-09 21:02:10 @MINIUSA my 2009 mini cost me more than the car was worth in the end. I spent 4500 dollars to repair the oil leak into the engine among other things. It had 22000 miles on it in 2015 when I had to get rid of it. I was in love with Mini Coopers until it became a nightmare 
1579 2018-10-09 21:01:49 Not to mention our continuous bombing of #Yemen just to curl up to a totalitarian human rights violator of a Kingdom for their oil. How's that for "respected" foreign policy?
1580 2018-10-09 21:01:44 oil execs are honestly dumb as shit they made all their money killing the planet and won’t even get to enjoy being rich because the world is going to end
1581 2018-10-09 21:01:42 Bio Oil is a great product to help minimize scarring. Definitely worth a shot.
1582 2018-10-09 21:01:34 Fresh thyme, rosemary, oregano, parsley, sage, onions, garlic, mushrooms, olive oil...OMG! I’m feeling like little Italy all up in here! Spaghetti night!

1587 2018-10-09 21:00:45 If my mum sells palm oil and my dad sells gas and I tell my friends my parents are into oil and gas I'm wrong?
1588 2018-10-09 21:00:36 Big oil prices give a few times over the amount of what the VAT increase will give, so the issue is not about some lack of money for spending. It is about keeping budget balancing oil price at $40 which means that all excess can not by law be spent but only moved to reserves.

1596 2018-10-09 21:00:15 Always with the military!

If it wasn't for the US, you'd be kissing Putin's ass even more than you are now for NG.

America is the largest oil producer in the world under Trump.

Plus we defend Germany, France and England.

I have family in Germany, so don't bullshit me.
1597 2018-10-09 21:00:14 Oil is used to make countless products.
1598 2018-10-09 21:00:05 October 09, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1601 2018-10-09 20:59:54 I think I’m officially an oil fiend
1602 2018-10-09 20:59:52 Only Norway has oil. They built a huge Heritage fund with it to better Norwegian society. The AB Tories pissed their all away.
1603 2018-10-09 20:59:44 Eucalyptus oil works well for moving adhesives. Not sure if it’s available in your part of the world.
1604 2018-10-09 20:59:39 Never looked at either. Will support big oil version. Did anyone bother to ask him anything? Like a basic question that exposes his bias and lack of knowledge? Anyone?
1605 2018-10-09 20:59:37 What don’t mechanics understand about do my oil change and my oil change only. I didn’t ask you about wtf else you recommend my guy

1607 2018-10-09 20:59:05 Conservatives are - by an enormous majority - the ones who pump the oil, grow the food, and have the blue collar jobs that keep liberal life nice and comfortable.

You want to play hardball? Go ahead. We can easily win this fight by taking a few days off from work.

1614 2018-10-09 20:58:06 Technology is a liberal conspiracy, @jkenney is really letting hard working Albertans down. Pipelines will bring our super duper clean oil to market, and help reverse climate change. Give oil a chance.

1622 2018-10-09 20:56:40 best place for an oil change?
1623 2018-10-09 20:56:37 Yes... I tried to find the tweet but I can’t. Girls are rolling towels/tissue and putting a condom on it then using baby oil as lube because they want thrush too 
1624 2018-10-09 20:56:36 is an oil change supposed to take two hours or is that just part of someone demolishing my voodoo doll for the last two weeks?
1625 2018-10-09 20:56:35 liberal plan has CDNs swallowing CO2 Tax 'behaviour alteration' pill so we can be in oil/gas game. Nail CDNs because we provide up to 20% of US refineries crude? In effect the USA Offloads their GHG burden on us and none of this will lower world GHG balance or temps, at all.

1629 2018-10-09 20:56:04 Think you're missing the mark here. I was asked why Talbot came into it. Was merely pointing out that you have an Edmonton following but talking Calgary would bring both fan bases in. My skin isn't that thin.
1630 2018-10-09 20:55:34 I used to roast my own low-carb muesli, almost identical composition. The only thing missing is roasted sesame seeds, and I used hazelnuts instead of walnuts and no cashews. Tip: Cook in the microwave with heavy cream, coconut oil and egg => keto porridge!

1647 2018-10-09 20:53:25 I think so. No one has discussed Big Tech entering the EV space since Apple’s rumoured car back in 2015. The recent focus has been on Big Oil thanks to Total’s investments and BP citing our lithium price. Let the discussion begin...
1648 2018-10-09 20:53:24 Twitter loves coconut oil
1649 2018-10-09 20:53:24 Nope, We got literal free basically infinite money in the shape of tons of Oil & Gas, lots of land, great geographical location, and only 6.5 million people. Logically we have no reason to be as poor and shit as we are.
Libya just fucking suck at the game.
1650 2018-10-09 20:53:21 I walked into work to get my oil changed for a discount.

This has accumulated til now and now the major reason of low reserves is the oil prices and that's why we have to go to IMF

1669 2018-10-09 20:51:47 I don’t have the UPC code. I threw out the box already. It was butternut squash purée.  Wondering why there’s palm oil in there.
1670 2018-10-09 20:51:45 Barbershop ignorance is like an oil fire. Just gotta let them niggas talk til they run outta juice
1671 2018-10-09 20:51:44 Have a little read on it Paul, the only main issue is it can be expensive to extract however at first so was drilling into the earth for oil and they brought the cost of that down, and they could with hydrogen, in America they already have hydrogen cars
1672 2018-10-09 20:51:40 You're not necessarily wrong, but it's not necessarily the best attitude either. I come to set thinking I want to make you wet because coconut oil doesn't taste as good as you do (usually)
1673 2018-10-09 20:51:19 Sounds daft but cod liver oil mate old joints maybe they only little legs carry alot weight worth try mate
1674 2018-10-09 20:51:18 Google Plus just never grooved with me. I tried it for a hot minute and then moved on. Like oil and water.
1675 2018-10-09 20:51:13 Fry until the edges are crispy, then flip.  The more you cook, the hotter the oil, the quicker they cook.

Eat with ketchup, sour cream, or applesauce, traditionally, or however you want.
1676 2018-10-09 20:51:10 Need long term solutions. Why didn't they increase oil prices last year ELECTIONZ. Why didn't pti increase prices this month. Because by elections
1677 2018-10-09 20:51:05 I’m confused as to what takes so long to get an oil change and a tire rotation? 2.5 hours of my life...
1678 2018-10-09 20:50:48 and the answer is?
1679 2018-10-09 20:50:45 Republicans don’t care about natives Americans rights! They conquer everything and build stupid pipeline that will mess up the air and earth. I rather drink water not oil. I’m voting BLUE!!! I’m not a fan of rich corporations greediness.
1680 2018-10-09 20:50:44 Anybody wanna take my truck to get a oil change?..
1681 2018-10-09 20:50:42 I NEED to be in a FOREST, AIR, GREEN, BREEZE, BIRDS, I MISS THAT FUCK
1682 2018-10-09 20:50:34 The monopoly needs to be broken. Different minds, different outcome. Look how good our energy producing companies grew when the Congress broke up Jay Paul Getty. And his oil monopoly.
1683 2018-10-09 20:50:23 one massive container ship equals 50 million cars. So if we build the pipelines, including Energy Easy, you will not have to use Cargo ships to bring oil to Canada, That will save as much fuel, as all the cars on the planet!

1691 2018-10-09 20:49:54 Do you not see the circular logic here, though? Why do you think the south did not end slavery? Why do you think the GOP legislate in the favor of oil companies? They are acting on behalf of those economic interests.
1692 2018-10-09 20:49:53 You can always change it yourself at half the price. It's 35 dollars every time I change the oil in my Corvettes. If you need help check it out on YouTube for your year make and model...

1694 2018-10-09 20:49:45 Plenty of good observations Chris. I work for a diversified independent and employees are pissed. Our company is spending 10 times more on share buybacks this year that exploration! We can’t get any new projects approved because our in house oil forecast is around 55 dollars
1695 2018-10-09 20:49:33 To me right now, the biggest "Why bother existing?" is climate change. Why bother planning for a future when we are actively destroying it through deliberate ignorance and kowtowing to the oil and gas magnates?
1696 2018-10-09 20:49:27 Ideas for a 1oz hip flask? I accidentaly ordered a way too small hipflask. It says on the bottom it is 1oz. Any ideas on what I could carry in it because perhaps this can be useful. Perhaps an oil of some sorts or some strong spirit?

1702 2018-10-09 20:48:48 When you need energy desperately for growth, everyone goes for the oil  plants cuz they are scaleable and fast.
Why all the deficit? Increase the selling price to cover cost.

1708 2018-10-09 20:48:12 Without Scotland the post-Brexit UK will lose it's only source of oil and will have the EU on its border if Scotland joins. 

Fortress Britain will be no more, now that the outside world has a way in.
1709 2018-10-09 20:48:11 And am very sure Emir Sanusi will not be part of it as he owns 2 oil Well in Biafra Land. These guys have amassed great deal of wealth for their 10th generations to come.

1711 2018-10-09 20:48:11 This is nonsense. Venezuela’s foreign debt is denominated in dollars and based on oil prices. The latter sank driving their currency down, which creates inflation as it makes dollars more expensive. However, this level of complexity seems foreign to you.
1712 2018-10-09 20:48:08 It’s not all ships they are building, it’s rigs, Christmas trees etc for the offshore market, we lost a hell of a lot of those jobs last few years with the oil crisis

Peel and blend four potatoes in a food processor.  

blend in on medium yellow onion

Add one egg, one tsp of salt, and 2tbsp of flour.

it should be between the consistency of applesauce and salsa.  Not like hash browns.

1719 2018-10-09 20:47:39 No. I’m pointing out hypocrisy of only blaming high petrol prices on oil coy margins when high (needed) tax, the falling NZD and the big increase in crude oil prices are the really big factors in petrol prices. Just taking aim at hard working petrol station owners is a big rough.

1727 2018-10-09 20:46:30 Oh he does have support here which is so odd to me since its like voting against your paycheck and best interest. Everything here is supported by oil and gas.

1754 2018-10-09 20:44:02 So yeah, I totally agree on the blame game getting us nowhere. My issue is that Amanda’s tweet seems to have laid all of it at the oil/coal companies’ feet, when we need to do something at every stage of the chain. 5/5

1756 2018-10-09 20:43:54 My thoughts exactly lmao like this is alllll wrong. And the baby oil just tops off the yeast infection. Lol she don’t love her coochie
1757 2018-10-09 20:43:53 Beto is a smooth talking snake oil salesman. He would be absolutely terrible for Texas and the US. We don't need any more partisan hacks, especially of the DNC variety who currently campaign on less individual liberty and civility.
1758 2018-10-09 20:43:50 You gotta ask niggas to help you put oil in your car, you gotta ask niggas to pump your gas for you, like damn.... wtf type of breed are these niggas bro?
1759 2018-10-09 20:43:39 same, just got home $800 later after buying new tires and oil change
1760 2018-10-09 20:43:35 And pmln whole electricity plan was based on oil prices keeping low. Which completely back fired when oil proces started to skyrocket. Hence the huge fiscal deficit, trade deficit and circular debt. Or is that not true also?
1761 2018-10-09 20:43:34 I’m not claiming they’re a silver bullet, but once you raise the price to its “real” cost you’ve got a radical catalyst. We’ve overpolluted because oil and coal are *astonishingly* cheap energy sources - change that, and you change everything. 4/5

Also, is the oil money theft a lie??? If so, how did he afford his properties?

1779 2018-10-09 20:41:02 You actually use a special kind of oil type crayon to draw on a stone. In this case I thinned it with something and made it like a paint. It’s an involved process. You then treat it with rosin and use a roller to put the ink on the stone. It only sticks to where you drew/painted.

1785 2018-10-09 20:40:16 A literal lamp doesn't even generate light; it just contains oil or kerosone which produces light in combustion.  Also, most lamps aren't very bright either.

1798 2018-10-09 20:39:46 ...grab some kernels from the supermarket, heat up some vegetable oil in a pan, throw the kernels in, and wait about 10 minutes. Shit slaps, severely.
1799 2018-10-09 20:39:42 The US might have wanted to do that, but I'm pretty sure that Venezuela collapsed because of its extensive "socialism" depended entirely on oil revenues. Ask Saudi Arabia or Alberta how this works out.
1800 2018-10-09 20:39:39 The scarf you bought me is never going on my head.  My castor oil would ruin it! lol.  It was my sleeping scarf.  I have to walk past a whole bunch of low hanging trees to get to my apartment and I think one jumped on me.

1802 2018-10-09 20:39:26 We are in a position to prove they have been stealing for a very long time. We also now understand that the off shore tax havens are filtering away oil money and we know who (ie what) is doing it.
1803 2018-10-09 20:39:12 I have access to medical marijuana and CBD products. I regularly use CBD oil for pain. Sadly, no matter how much I use, my CBD oil does nothing for my neck. 

Hence the tried everything part. Sigh.
1804 2018-10-09 20:38:51 Starting CBD oil treatment today to help with my chronic pain and depression after three years of trying a dozen or so different psychotropic meds. Fingers crossed I get some relief. Thanks for quick, efficient delivery @lazarusnaturals

1807 2018-10-09 20:38:31 The top bro, it was mixing oil and water.
1808 2018-10-09 20:38:28 Not really permanent as oil will only last a few hundred, coal a few hundred more. The argument is entirely about money and people wanting not to spend it now.
1809 2018-10-09 20:38:14 To pretend that oil & coal are the only Rx for poverty is being intentionally blind to a bunch of options that might cure the illness without killing the patient. Might that require some government intervention? Probably. But so does the status quo.
1810 2018-10-09 20:38:04 move closer to where you work. drive slower. dont frequent energy intensive restaurants. eat simply, at home. drive less. take a walk. boycott major oil company gas stations. if you can, get off the grid.

There's a lot of good resources online for organizing, and if you can get other groups participating and media coverage, you might make a difference. We don't need more oil pipelines.

Meanwhile, kindly edit and add 2018. Crude oil prices have increased.
1833 2018-10-09 20:35:50 Let the panic begin. However, if you do the math, 40% of the Gulf oil production represents less than 3% of the U.S. demand. So. Just another clickbait story to create panic, sell ads and drive oil prices up.

1851 2018-10-09 20:34:53 Oof, that's a good question.

I got CBD oil and it's the only other thing that relieved my back pain. But it's not covered by insurance and so was more expensive and abandoned.

1894 2018-10-09 20:31:04 It’s all about oil, if you strip away all the propaganda it’s money, greed and not caring about the people unfortunately 
1895 2018-10-09 20:31:03 The government of Jamaica has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Stuart Townsend in a dazzle wig.
1896 2018-10-09 20:30:38 Emma Hardie Facial oil. Use it after her amazing cleansing balm with @PIXIBeauty glow tonic. Get involved with watching @CarolineHirons and @jamie_genevieve YouTube stuff and you’ll never spend money on stuff that doesn’t work again. Are you Glasgow based? X

1898 2018-10-09 20:30:34 When the oil runs out? That’s a good question, what is the prediction on it running out?
1899 2018-10-09 20:30:33 girl most kbeauty brand lipsticks are so good for dry lips bc they have oil in them (especially peripera, etude house and 3ce)
1900 2018-10-09 20:30:30 @ClimateReality While the Americans guzzle gas,  frack and destroy the Artic in the name of revenues from more oil and gas, the Planet will continue along its path of destruction.  Then,  people can blame Trump if he's still alive. M

1907 2018-10-09 20:29:52 kapag iniisip mong mag 123 sa jeep, isipin mo yung oil price hike, mataas na sweldo ng mga opisyal na nakaupo lang maghapon at lampas 8 hours na kayod ng mga driver para lang sa boundary nila.

1910 2018-10-09 20:29:30 That's BS. Look at all the news from Venezuela no one is starving! No one. Its propaganda for the war were by to start for oil n $$$$. We purchased 1.15 million barrels of oil per day in Sept. There going g on the gold standard 1 Nov. Bankers cant control them if this persists

1915 2018-10-09 20:28:54 Mona Lisa is oil on panel, tho
1916 2018-10-09 20:28:52 Or we could spend it now, on decarbonising the economy, insulating ourselves from oil price shocks, etc. 
Saving for a "rainy day" is irresponsible, when we know the storm is approaching.
1917 2018-10-09 20:28:47 Ratfish liver oil is by far the best and cleanest source of omega 3
1918 2018-10-09 20:28:28 And Ted Cruz voted against the violence against women act. Oil affects a lot of people violence against women affects half of the population! So we know what he thinks about women…
1919 2018-10-09 20:28:24 An Oiler writer talks about the Flames and you don't see a natural progression? Glass houses and all that?
1920 2018-10-09 20:28:17 Out of interest, how can an oil be hydrating? It contains no water so I don't understand.
1921 2018-10-09 20:28:11 Yes, they should bench him. then we can worry about the depression and the inflation and the oil prices.
1922 2018-10-09 20:28:10 The injustice of the South Australian justice system. 
Today, Jenny Hallam @72Hallam faces court again. Purpose of proving medicinal cannabis oil to the sick and dying. This is a political stunt @ScottMorrisonMP @LiberalAus and shame on the prosecution for dragging this out.
1923 2018-10-09 20:28:10 Loads of stuff. Coconut oil or normal solid veg fat for pastry which loads of people use without even realising it’s vegan

1928 2018-10-09 20:27:40 HA! Have you read the latest UN report on climate change? A huge problem & none of the answers include oil rigs off Florida’s coast! In fact, we have 11 years - 11 years!!! - to limit a climate change catastrophe. It’s time to convert fossil fuel energy to renewable green energy.
1929 2018-10-09 20:27:23 Fait peur cette map!

1932 2018-10-09 20:27:05 Like Mr. Levin said, “ constitutionalism and progressivism are like water and oil.”
1933 2018-10-09 20:27:00 I can feel that oil running through my pipes in the night 
1934 2018-10-09 20:26:53 Repubs like mcconnell are paid for by Kochs, Adelson, Mercers, Bernard Marcus, Sinquefield, Ken Griffin, oil companies, various land holding groups (the Villages in Florida, what the heck?) & other 2 percenters. That’s why they think they don’t have to listen to us or U.S.
1935 2018-10-09 20:26:52 Cod liver oil bruh
1936 2018-10-09 20:26:48 No, actually you don't seem to know who they are: they are oil-company-funded public relations people picking and choosing misleading headlines and articles created by other fossil fuel fueled "think tanks". They try to project a veneer of "science" even while they spout BS.
1937 2018-10-09 20:26:46 I coconut oil the skin
1938 2018-10-09 20:26:41 I have noticed "Sudan Red"  in the ingredient list of their almond oil.

1940 2018-10-09 20:26:32 So cruz put a billboard about raising oil prices in a part of the city that is all industrial jobs. Higher oil prices = more oil field jobs

1942 2018-10-09 20:26:18 Ordinary people who eat sadza and vegetables from their home gardens are employed in the stores that are shutting down. 
They need their salary to buy hupfu, cooking oil, sugar, pay rent, school fees and many other things. Don't downplay the impact of companies closing.

1947 2018-10-09 20:25:37 Just sat on FT to @Aemelia_Fox and cried for a solid half an hour at how ugly I am and she’s just told me to take Evening Primrose Oil for being a hormonal wee cow. 
1948 2018-10-09 20:25:31 When u find out Grayson is not extra virgin like the oil 
1949 2018-10-09 20:25:16 It should be legalized on a federal level. It’s a life saver for people without the side effects of other medications. Unfortunately even veterinarians aren’t suppose to use CBD oil to treat animals even though Cornell University has shown it really helps.
1950 2018-10-09 20:25:09 If it's coconut oil, at least it tastes good. No joke though, I got so many compliments on my Betty Crocker and coke from folk that I decided to just pack it in.  Packet mix is good enough!
1951 2018-10-09 20:25:01 The world now is burning 100mill barrels of oil/day, as gallons that is about 4bil - 1/2 gal for every person on earth/day. And rising.The climate change we have seen is but a warm-up, Things will surely become awful, but if we fail the Earth will become a veritable hell realm.
1952 2018-10-09 20:24:54 I've been dehydrated since I woke up and I bet my blood is thicker than oil for a CAT.
1953 2018-10-09 20:24:51 I guess I haven't leveled up my sarcasm stat; a West Texan oil boom does nothing for millennials, especially those shits who keep playing loud music in my coal mines.

1957 2018-10-09 20:24:34 For sure. I’m not ashamed and know it’s a miracle plant. Heck my cousins child has seizures and since they started giving her cbd oil it’s been amazing. Not to mention helping with anxiety, pain and my mom who died of cancer who hated weed smoked it with me just so she could eat
1958 2018-10-09 20:24:32 Chicken grease and baby oil..
1959 2018-10-09 20:24:30 Just don't touch seed/vegetable oil and you can't get that out of whack. Have some salmon or sardines here and there. No need to supplement.

1961 2018-10-09 20:24:03 They have oil, that’s all that Matters unfortunately 
1962 2018-10-09 20:23:55 Slight correction: Fossil fuel is the energy of the past, the PRESENT, and the NEAR FUTURE.

When a viable source of energy can economically REPLACE oil, only then will oil be the past.

1971 2018-10-09 20:22:54 You have to remember, this is about short-term goals...not long-term. This is to put pressure on OPEC to stop games with oil prices. The less dependent we are on oil and the less we buy on the world market, the more powerful we are. So this is a means to show OPEC we will fight.
1972 2018-10-09 20:22:39 It’s shocking how much of an impact the fashion industry has on the earth, second to coal/oil industry! Definitely recommend watching Stacey Dooley’s #FashionsDirtySecrets for an eye opening documentary

1979 2018-10-09 20:21:41 All solvable problems.  Solar and wind however, are not renewable, never have been, that is just a marketing term thought up by the same Malthusians.  In a world without oil, we could not afford to make solar panels and wind turbines.
1980 2018-10-09 20:21:30 Cleared from inflation about 16 %.

2007 2018-10-09 20:18:24 I just thought everyone knew that everyone that works in the oil and construction industry here makes a shit ton of money so they raised the prices
2008 2018-10-09 20:18:23 Need to purchase some caster oil quick
2009 2018-10-09 20:18:15 Sadly (I am half Scot) the oil revenues don’t belong to Scotland as the sea map differs in international law from the land map.Very unfair,but that’s life.
2010 2018-10-09 20:18:12 Nothing like incentives to move the masses, economic as such. It works. Look at Norway, my country. Big oil producer, best selling arena of EVs. All incentives. The climate doesn’t «do» anything. But we ARE seeing an uprecedented rise in atmospheric CO2-levels. Why experiment?
2011 2018-10-09 20:18:09 Fake news. The storm is to the east of most of the oil and gas fields in the gulf. As are most of the refineries. Any impact to most of the rigs will be mainly large swells and some rain.
2012 2018-10-09 20:18:04 Hmm. Yeah that might help. I use a blend of spices that's similar to like an Italian type of seasoning and a crapton of olive oil when I bake chicken. But I get it. Also spoil yourself a little and add in some thighs...less bland

2019 2018-10-09 20:17:26 Nothing will happen until oil starts to run out. This will spark a global war which will end civilisation and possibly the human race...& throughout this the world will be turning, unmoved by our petty life’s.

2021 2018-10-09 20:17:12 No. Because their process is stacked in favour of big oil and self interest.

To believe otherwise is naive. 

But perhaps comforting. To each his or her own i guess... 

We have got lots of time, right?

2022 2018-10-09 20:16:58 Citeh fans think football's incarnation coincided with oil money entering the EPL though?  Funny cos when i was a kid all i can remember is them yoyo-ing up and down (mostly down) the leagues
2023 2018-10-09 20:16:53 US Closing prices: #DOW -0.21% #NASDAQ 0.26% #Ftse100 0.06% #GBPUSD 1.3141 #EURGBP 0.8747 #EURUSD 1.1495 #Gold 0.15% #Oil -0.15%
2024 2018-10-09 20:16:52 I was legit so freaked out by this 

Did he have an interview the next week and oil started dripping out his forehead? That's how I remember it but I'm assuming my brain has exaggerated it
2025 2018-10-09 20:16:49 Even the big oil companies support carbon pricing. It is The little guys that don’t care about the future and are more concerned with profit.
2026 2018-10-09 20:16:22 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
2027 2018-10-09 20:16:15 Not much oil in Afghanistan, Tunisia, Algeria, Yemen..........all had their fair share of murderous dictators.
2028 2018-10-09 20:16:06 Dear Mom 
You are speaking logic and law to a liberal. You may as well mix oil and vinegar.
2029 2018-10-09 20:15:52 Literally right next to Lucas Oil, it's called circle center
2030 2018-10-09 20:15:51 @Chief_Obasanjo set to endorse @atiku... Simply because Buhari refuses to renew his Oil blocks.

Honestly speaking, @MBuhari's enemies are Nigeria's enemies.

We should be expecting IBB to follow suit. With these people this country's future is very SHADY.
2031 2018-10-09 20:15:47 No this is fear porn propaganda for the communist Agenda 21/2030, based on lies.The proposer himself (Maurice Strong) was a billionaire socialist who commited fraud (Oil for food scandal in 95) and fled to and hid... In China. THIS IS THE BIGGEST FRAUD OF ALL AND WE MUST STOP IT!
2032 2018-10-09 20:15:47 THE BEST WAY TO BRING DOWN OIL PRICES - INVEST IN SUSTAINABLE ENERGY, WIND, SOLAR, TIDE ... DO AWAY WITH OIL ALL TOGETHER AND WE CAN HAVE A HEALTHIER PLANET. #ItsOUrPlanet #BePlanetSmart #EndOilDependency #Sustainability
2033 2018-10-09 20:15:39 "We just struck oil!" Tom gushed.
2034 2018-10-09 20:15:36 Oil and water
2035 2018-10-09 20:15:33 Trump complaining about 74.00 per barrel. Wants to get that down and go after ethanol. Talks about the farmers...I guess the oil guys are much to him right now?
2036 2018-10-09 20:15:20 It seems to me that if the ‘Lazy Susan’ had been historically targeted toward men for oil/paint can storage, we’d be calling that turntable thing a ‘Guru Gary’. #SmartSusan 
2037 2018-10-09 20:15:19 I have said, I am happy to pay the fuel taxes since it is all now allocated to transport. But it’s a bit rich blaming all price increases on oil Coys when crude oil has nearly doubled since it hit its low and the NZD has fallen 12.5% in the last 7 months.
2038 2018-10-09 20:15:14 Theres a reason the big boys never really did electric vehicles like you did. The attachment to big oil!!!
2039 2018-10-09 20:15:05 oh no that was just for the oil change itself. they said my tires needed rotated but it’d be an additional $25. apparently they were out of the normal synthetic oil. :’) and my car’s been driving funny so i knew i’d keep putting it off if I left. ugh
2040 2018-10-09 20:15:00 No thoughts on all the new monthly “bills” we — in lots  of cases —we choose to saddle ourselves with? Cell phone, internet, cable, in many case oil/natural gas heat (as opposed to wood that was cut), increased electric bill from A/C?? How much is does that add to a month?
2041 2018-10-09 20:14:54 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

KJV. Numbers 28:13
2042 2018-10-09 20:14:50 @realDonaldTrump The full boycott of oil is the key to your victory in the November election, believe the truth. The exemption is catastrophic for you and for the Republicans, you were not such a man to exempt you so much,
2043 2018-10-09 20:14:44 Better person
More oil to ur head
2044 2018-10-09 20:14:43 2 tablespoons of palm oil = Home remedy for mild food poisoning (usually a sharp cramp on the left of your tummy which may also involve running stomach)
2045 2018-10-09 20:14:42 And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;

KJV. Numbers 28:12
2046 2018-10-09 20:14:40 olive oil byre speckles a spice
2047 2018-10-09 20:14:37 let’s get this oil change & truck fixed
2048 2018-10-09 20:14:36 I want both to pay. Neither one of these men deserve to stand up right after innocent children , people. Poor people, unarmed farmers , Sheppards. The deal is for oil. Saudi Prince sold his people out. I would like to to see how well he suffers
2049 2018-10-09 20:14:30 He dey dig crude oil!!lolz
2050 2018-10-09 20:14:23 You do realize one of the biggest users of oil on the planet is petroleom based fertilizers so more plants on the table doesn't equal less pollution...that farm equipment isn't electric
2051 2018-10-09 20:14:23 When you're trying to lose weight but your housemate puts cooking oil in food like the world is about to end  nkare ke itshasitse lip gloss
2052 2018-10-09 20:14:21 Pretty sure she's drinking olive oil in that photo though or I hope so at least 
2053 2018-10-09 20:14:06 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:

KJV. Numbers 28:9
2054 2018-10-09 20:14:06 Trump just explained his support for more ethanol...and it makes some sense. It's a way to combat against high oil prices and OPEC. I guess I can get on board with that. Controlling our energy sources is very important.
2055 2018-10-09 20:13:33 Dare I ask but if the price for a barrel of Western Canadian Select (oil) is so low, why are our fuel prices so high? There appears to be a disconnect between the two. Also, why is there concern by conservatives about government carbon pricing but not corporate pricing? #cdnpoli
2056 2018-10-09 20:13:32 The Alfa One spread doesn’t but looks like can only get the oil here
2057 2018-10-09 20:13:31 @UEFrance I’m surprised that president of one country of our migrant spent 15 millions for presidential plane  and 16millions for an other, money coming from like Aladin oil lamp . Not for other pb in investissement
2058 2018-10-09 20:13:22 よし
2059 2018-10-09 20:13:17 Worst case is that the US demands something we can't do, like shutting down the oil sands entirely. Internationally, the oil sands have a Mordor-like rep (see Chris Turner's "The Patch" for a sympathetic history).
2060 2018-10-09 20:13:10 If we buy in early do we also get a free set of steak knives. Snake oil saleman
2061 2018-10-09 20:13:05 @realDonaldTrump do not play on their land because you will fail. President Trump warns you all seriously. If you give China or India an exemption and buy oil from Iran on November 4, it will be a big defeat for you, and you will definitely pay a heavy price on the election
2062 2018-10-09 20:13:02 I definitely notice the MCT Oil.
The L Theanine, not so much though to does seem to make horrible coffee less horrible.

2064 2018-10-09 20:12:54 Bro Chevy washed my truck when I took it to get an oil change this morning I was hella happy bc it was all clean then I went to my farm & it only took me 30 min to get it all muddy again smh
2065 2018-10-09 20:12:51 Fired Trex in 2012 because XOM became a disaster as a company and an investment. Bought cvx, a much better oil company.  (Disclaimer: XOM annuitant.)
2066 2018-10-09 20:12:50 If there was no oil in the Middle East none of this would happen, it’s just all about money and greed all above the welfare of it’s people unfortunately. #houseofassad #adangerousdynasty
2067 2018-10-09 20:12:49 I find it amazing people have never seen the correlation between value of oil reserves and WM debt, both increase at same rate
2068 2018-10-09 20:12:46 Green energy alone cannot handle the population's needs. It is not cost effective, nor is it as effective as oil, coal, and natural gas. Replacing fossil fuels, or putting heavy taxes will just hurt the poor and middle class. It could send this planet back to the dark ages.
2069 2018-10-09 20:12:37 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

KJV. Numbers 28:5
2070 2018-10-09 20:12:36 Those were the days. The smell of the whale oil lamps and the scratching of all those quills.
2071 2018-10-09 20:12:33 Or you know you could actually hold the corporations and oil companies accountable since they push out way more emissions than any individual could do.
2072 2018-10-09 20:12:31 Why? Let's focus on shipping oil across Canada to the Maritime provinces first?  They are being supplied by Saudia Arabia? Why? 
With abundance in Alberta?
2073 2018-10-09 20:12:29 @realDonaldTrump Israeli and Jewish politicians are trying to surrender the tramp to exempt some countries in the boycott of oil, if he leaves them, he will also face this fate. Therefore, I insist on not exempting any country in the oil embargo,
2074 2018-10-09 20:12:21 It really does depend on the individual pushing the policy and how the rules are written.  For example, petcoke is a "waste" product of the oil industry that is almost entirely carbon.  But it is not waste.  It is integral to the production of steel and in some areas electricity.
2075 2018-10-09 20:12:20 fuzzies, immediately take 4 ibuprofen & 2 Benadryl to sleep it off and that worked for me. Also! Rubbing peppermint & lavender oil on my forehead, temples and back of the neck helped a ton too. I really hope you can get your meds because migraines are the worst. What a SHIT dr
2076 2018-10-09 20:12:11 Yet Quebec uses Oil so what would be the problem? Do Quebecers  prefer foreign oil being shipped by Tanker down the pristine waters of the St.Lawrence?
2077 2018-10-09 20:12:08 Warm oil bath, candles lit, warm herbal drink and then get cosy in a fluffy dressing gown and then finish with a sleep spray sprayed onto the pillow. Bliss 
2078 2018-10-09 20:12:08 Chill down time,candles lit causing lovely sparkles off the sequins on the voiles. Lavender oil in the diffuser, cup of chamomile tea, music on and chicco curled up purring.  Ahhhh. 
2079 2018-10-09 20:12:04 Not just that, but it's also based on the idea that natural resources are infinite. In the 80s oil companies literally put out ads bragging that They have enough oil to melt glaciers. Since growth is everything we must produce useless things non-stop, subsided by nature/ poor ppl

2083 2018-10-09 20:11:49 Ugh I’m so sorry  migraines are literal hell. I second the CBD oil usage. I haven’t used it to treat migraines but I have used it for anxiety and it works. Also, I was never on migraine medication but someone told me the “magic migraine cocktail” when you start seeing the..
2084 2018-10-09 20:11:35 Can you grab me one of the moisturizers? The moisturizing factors with hyluronic, (big one if they have it) and rose hip oil? Thanks!
2085 2018-10-09 20:11:31 Yes! I take salmon oil too. It is great for inflammation. :)
2086 2018-10-09 20:11:29 did you cover this point in oil or something because some folks just can not grasp it
2087 2018-10-09 20:11:24 Syria is no different.  A close examination of the positions of oil and gas fields, and the connecting infrastructure is a fascinating lens through which to observe middle eastern geopolitics.
2088 2018-10-09 20:11:23 Or Beavertown Neck Oil.
2089 2018-10-09 20:11:18 Several days ago, I bought Just Cause 2 from Steam and played it for the first time in four years. It brings back memories of me blowing up oil tanks and taking down choppers on my Xbox 360. 

I recommend the game to anyone who's looking for a good GTA clone.

2107 2018-10-09 20:10:24 @realDonaldTrump Israel does not want Iran's oil to be completely cut off, so my account with 150 followers Limited. All must unite and stand up against Israel. I do not know if I'm upset or happy with Haley. I know the reason for his resignation.

2114 2018-10-09 20:10:02 ur putting baby oil in WHEREEEE
2115 2018-10-09 20:09:52 She wants independence at all costs ..... Notice she dare not mention the Scottish oil and gas industry today as part of Scotland's booming economy .......
2116 2018-10-09 20:09:51 So is this down to HARRP  so once again the oil prices can be manipulated  or am I way off track?
2117 2018-10-09 20:09:51 so...ethanol was introduced as a oxygenator in gasoline to replace MBTE which was determined to have carcinogenic effects. So SOME ethanol is good and important for gasoline. But mixing ever more ethanol into gasoline is really intended to just use less crude oil
2118 2018-10-09 20:09:43 My dad calls all these things "snake oil" and I think that needs to be more broadly adopted.
2119 2018-10-09 20:09:37 I agree with you in general, but I'd like to say my grandparents actively fought against wind farms being built in their county. There are normal people with nothing to gain from oil who still argue against this. We need better education for all on this topic
2120 2018-10-09 20:09:35 Who cares if they're Mother Teresa on crack, THEY LOST that's all that matters
2121 2018-10-09 20:09:29 Baby Oil Should Only Go On Your Ass If You’re Using It While Fucking
2122 2018-10-09 20:09:28 don't bother answering, I mute scammers, whether they are offering me advice or literal snake oil. I don't see the difference between people who claim nonsense about vaccines and people who claim amputation is fixed with copper bracelets.
2123 2018-10-09 20:09:24 @joerogan Terrible news from the UN climate report. Can we speak about being smarter consumers (less plastic,less oil)? It’s our decisions at the cash register that makes a difference. You have a great forum to speak about it and allow people to think.
2124 2018-10-09 20:09:20 depending where you go they’ll rotate your tires and do an inspection without saying shit  my dealership tried to pull that on me once, I made sure they knew only an oil change lmaooo
2125 2018-10-09 20:09:16 You guys I was really driving my car with no oil, water or antifreeze
2126 2018-10-09 20:09:12 Cuantas calefacciones de gas oil y de carbón quedan en Madridy que me dices que pagando el gas oil mas  caro no contamina
2127 2018-10-09 20:09:04 I’m not bringing my car to get the oil changed ever again. I’ve never liked doing this shit but this shit sealed the deal.
2128 2018-10-09 20:08:54 Fuck, I just realized something else. 

They’re gonna have the NWO interfere in the Dirty Saudi Oil Money Old Man March, aren’t they?
2129 2018-10-09 20:08:48 Is there any tea tree oil product that smells good? Like any? I swear I love my tea tree face wash but it smells like feet
2130 2018-10-09 20:08:48 Vegetable oil
2131 2018-10-09 20:08:47 i mean all that is done now is expanding oil pipelines and coal mining, i don´t see any nuclear or geothermal energy expansion plans anywhere, in western europe you are going the oposite way even, we will at least slightly expand nuclear power plant(if liberals don´t block it)
2132 2018-10-09 20:08:43 The majority of products used on a daily basis is petroleum based. Think the BIG OIL COMPANIES are going to stop production? No they are headed to Venezuela as we speak. For what? To tear down a crumbling infrastructure? It's failed already.
2133 2018-10-09 20:08:42 Oil. I think you mean oil.
2134 2018-10-09 20:08:39 Almost out of Beard oil :(
2135 2018-10-09 20:08:32 Not been good for a long while
2136 2018-10-09 20:08:29 And THEN she got baby oil..baby oil breaks condoms 
2137 2018-10-09 20:08:19 The US/Saudi are fuming  because Putin has Putin has deals with Assad for oil and gas (the proper way not sending in proxy armies to do the dirty work) also Pence and Exxon had a deal to drill for oil in the Artic Circle and that fell through because of the alleged election...
2138 2018-10-09 20:08:11 Oil on canvas?
2139 2018-10-09 20:08:10 french fries always make me feel irresponsible the most. look, all i see with those things are sacs of oil
2140 2018-10-09 20:08:07 @GinaGrad @BaldBryan @AdamCarollaShow Terrible news from the UN climate report. Can we speak about being smarter consumers (less plastic,less oil)?

2141 2018-10-09 20:07:52 But coal and oil are infinite? What even?
2142 2018-10-09 20:07:50 i use cake mix and smashed bananas with coconut oil mixed into a sort of gloop
2143 2018-10-09 20:07:40 Everyday I see something wild on here. Baby oil sigh
2144 2018-10-09 20:07:32 I use coconut oil 
2145 2018-10-09 20:07:17 Oil and gas pipelines were and are the sole motivation for the West’s adventures in Afghanistan.  The number of dead and displaced people is a total irrelevance.  War is working.
2146 2018-10-09 20:07:17 Might buy some beard oil tomorrow #excited
2147 2018-10-09 20:07:17 Why did Vanderbilt invest in ships and then trains? Why are people building houses? Profit.

Why did Knox-Darcy scout for oil? Profit. Why are oil pipes being built? Profit.

We can imagine such utter amounts of useful profitable stuff that hasn’t been built yet. No UBI needed.
2148 2018-10-09 20:07:14 I don’t mind high petrol taxes, since they have all gone to specified things, mostly transport. 15 years ago that wasn’t the case. But, it’s hypocritical to put all the blame on oil Coys when Govt taxes r $1.17 litre
2149 2018-10-09 20:07:06 Who does? Do you assert that Tom or Max (I am not familiar with Max) is in favor of coal or oil bailouts?
2150 2018-10-09 20:07:02 Pompeo: can see an output to Mexico oil
2151 2018-10-09 20:07:01 Only pay for the oil
2152 2018-10-09 20:07:00 Then add the fact that we aren't oil rich as Venezuela was!
2153 2018-10-09 20:06:53 Correctly said ...S 400 and oil from Iran are such examples
2154 2018-10-09 20:06:53 This is equivalent to $6-7 per gallon gasoline. This will never displace oil on its own, but entirely compatible with the economics of, say, keeping airlines in business with reasonably priced tickets
2155 2018-10-09 20:06:51 Worst week EVER! Just call it rancid heat treated oil and chemical shit storm week #GBBO
2156 2018-10-09 20:06:45 I guess you didn't get the memo that unless drastic action is taken to curb climate change there will be catastrophic consequences to bear.  But then you're all about gas and oil.  What measures have you taken to address the climate change and the environment?  NONE!
2157 2018-10-09 20:06:45 The economy you couldn't manage when oil barrel was up to $200 ?

2159 2018-10-09 20:06:41 Someone should make getting an oil change way more convenient.. I really think it’s a waste of time to come to a dealership to get an oil change..
2160 2018-10-09 20:06:38 True enough, but hasn’t medical evidence suggested that coconut oil is the devils‘ work in terms of health.
2161 2018-10-09 20:06:32 I wonder how many people still haven’t gotten their oil changed this year  hmu if that’s you, I got you lol
2162 2018-10-09 20:06:28 Probably. Better to use coconut and/or avocado oil. Both internal and external
2163 2018-10-09 20:06:22 Hurricane Michael is  a good reason to increase oil prices to four dollars a gallon
2164 2018-10-09 20:06:20 The only way to hold Ru accountable is to rid our government of it's puppets, decrease our reliance on oil, & elect sane, ethical, qualified politicians.
2165 2018-10-09 20:06:13 Whole plant oil is better.
2166 2018-10-09 20:06:05 And the wild horses are rounded up so the cattle have more ground and water to destroy and oil and gas companies can destroy the native land with their fracking and drilling.
2167 2018-10-09 20:05:59 Ok, but I think what they’re generally asking is for governments to quickly fund renewable energy sources, which they could do by taxing oil, coal and gas companies or the wealthiest 1% of their populations

2174 2018-10-09 20:04:39 Palm oil is not listed as an ingredient.

2189 2018-10-09 20:03:00 Or, not so much about ratings, as it is about ad revenue. Think of how many oil ads and Judicial Crisis Network ones (pro Kavanaugh) run on @msnbc. They don't want to piss off their source of $$$. Time for ALL corporations to do the right thing and change their business model.
2190 2018-10-09 20:02:59 Respectfully fisagree that high oil causing soft auto sales. Interest rate increase killing housing and nobody can afford $60 Grand for a new truck. I get that interest rates, China correlated but Fedis mostly counterfeiting anyway.

2204 2018-10-09 20:01:43 I fully expect carbon pricing to be a "shield" issue for the Liberals in 2019, not a "sword" issue - nobody likes higher taxes. That said, "we're an energy superpower, but we're too small to matter" isn't a plausible position. We have the world's third-largest oil reserves.

2211 2018-10-09 20:01:12 Omega 3 in Olive oil is ALA, we don’t use it must be converted to EPA/DHA & we only convert about 5%. Olive oil is primarily monounsaturated Omega 9

2216 2018-10-09 20:00:39 Lol you can!!!!! You can actually get CBD oil for topical use for inflammation or back/neck pain. But I take it orally and use the drops under my tongue, helps so much!
2217 2018-10-09 20:00:34 Grass fed butter, avocado oil, olive oil and coconut oil in that order! Avocado oil is great for high temp cooking.
2218 2018-10-09 20:00:32 One of them usually does it once a week after his long run, the other one does it about once ever 3-4 weeks.  I myself do the cold therapy any time I run over 10 miles... I also use cannabis based oil I make to help recuperation.

2222 2018-10-09 20:00:15 “America has reclaimed its throne atop the oil world. For the first time since 1973, the U.S. is the world’s largest producer of crude oil.”

So, explain again why we’re still using food to make ethanol? Stop using olden ‘Oil Crisis’ to force us to buy corn-ethanol we don’t need!

2279 2018-10-09 19:54:54 Well it's more complicated then that I believe... Its about private (oil in the case of nigeria) interests and also crushing debt/interest rates that derive from the banks.These are a bit old but here are some nice exposés on oil interests/collaborators and US involvement.

2282 2018-10-09 19:54:39 Actually, I don't mind the tariffs. What I mind is him paying off farmers... 

Farmers want better prices, deal with the squeeze. You don't bail them out with tax payer money... That's bullshit. And this goes for Oil, Coal etc. as well.

2292 2018-10-09 19:53:33 From my opinion, oil and gas is a liability since its beginning.

2297 2018-10-09 19:53:02 Interesting story I picked up on a blog today - Oil Patch Warriors...

            Seventy-five years ago this month, a Band of Roughnecks went abroad on a top secret mission into Robin Hood’s stomping grounds to punch oil wells to help fuel England’s war machines.

2302 2018-10-09 19:52:33 Today, Schachter Energy Research Services Inc.'s Josef Schacter predicted $100/bbl oil late 2019 #BNN.  Opportunities to reap the reward may actually come to Canada.

2303 2018-10-09 19:52:28 @ericnuttall When can we expect your next commentary? And what the heck is it going to take for big money to start flowing back into O&G?  I've never seen such a massive disconnect between oil prices and equities. At some point that gap has got to close doesn't it?
2304 2018-10-09 19:52:23 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

lotta people here who hate Big Oil and yet will fight like hell to maintain a car-centric built environment
2305 2018-10-09 19:52:19 Not sure what you mean. The best scientists told us in the 1980s there would be no more oil by the year 2000. And here we are living oil free, just fine.
2306 2018-10-09 19:52:03 Oil pastel cuz its levels to this shit 
2307 2018-10-09 19:51:55 In 2008 I bought cooking oil on the black market for $15 USA dollars
2308 2018-10-09 19:51:53 Boss we are subsidising this cooking oil for foreigners.They are coming with us dollars which they selling on the blackmarket,at $1:3.80 Bond,then hoard (panic buy) the cooking oil for resell at huge profits in their respective countries.
2309 2018-10-09 19:51:48 I love going for a $30 oil change and getting a list of repairs my car needs totaling like $1,000, when my car is only worth about $1,000. 
2310 2018-10-09 19:51:42 England gives us nothing.typical ignorant English comment.we send 70bn a year to Westminster through taxation and they send back 40bn to run the country while keeping the other 30bn for themselves so get your facts right. Also squandering our oil and gas cash
2311 2018-10-09 19:51:41 See bro these guys are dumb and don’t have any single sense.They don’t know Nigeria was depending on oil and when oil stops selling how do expect to get revenues.Where would we get dollars from?

2316 2018-10-09 19:51:24 It’s the best and so easy to make. Slice the brussel sprouts in half. Add 1 tbsp of oil into a pan, sprinkle, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne and red pepper flakes on them. Then drizzle some agave on them. Let them cook until one side is a bit golden brown. Perfection

2322 2018-10-09 19:50:49 Okay I’ll try that. I’ve been doing a sea salt soak twice a day w a lil bit of tea tree oil and it won’t go down it looks disgusting 
2323 2018-10-09 19:50:44 It's horrid. And hyped up. Margarine is a fab day substitute for vegan cakes. And tbh sunflower oil is perfect to cook with.

2328 2018-10-09 19:50:01 Yeah sure.... what do you know with real world experience.   Why are they so scared!! The damn oil companies get to retail the ethanol at the pumps. We can't pick it up directly. Give the consumer multiple choices  and let them figure what works for them. It's not that hard....
2329 2018-10-09 19:49:50 Banning new oil and gas permits in NZ before alternatives are available is also unfair and ineffective
2330 2018-10-09 19:49:40 Dropped an entire bottle, glass, of coconut hair oil from the landing to the totally unforgiving hallway floor. Am now desperately hoping its cleaning properties are as good as the moisturizing ones. Have been uselessly spreading it about for 30 mins. Hallway was dodgy anyway.

2337 2018-10-09 19:48:53 when I took my vehicle in for an oil change they showed me the air filter which was caked with white, they said this is happening with all vehicles when they started using it, so what are we breathing in?
2338 2018-10-09 19:48:41 Oil prices continue sharp increase but gasoline just inching up. GOP getting help from oil companies. Look for gas price jump after elections. #midterms
2339 2018-10-09 19:48:39 Solutions don’t get funded if they can’t or don’t serve Capital. What don’t you understand about that? Do you really think we couldn’t have already built a 100% renewable world if not for Oil fighting real solutions? Dig your head back in the sand.
2340 2018-10-09 19:48:39 finally got my oil changed and these people told me it’ll be $96..... tf you mean $96?????
2341 2018-10-09 19:48:39 How many nose mounted radiators/oil coolers were there in those days?

2345 2018-10-09 19:48:27 Oil change?
2346 2018-10-09 19:48:23 I never denied it, i said the people in power are using this to make more money as they do very little to change it. If they were really believers then why are most politicians subject to oil producing nations? Because those nations give both parties large amounts of money.

2349 2018-10-09 19:48:08 Usually you are spot on, but here you overlook key points. 1) Permian really is pipe constrained and that's about to change in a huge way - doubling of takeaway by 2020. 2) Iran. Oil would be $20/bbl if the Iran sanctions went away tomorrow. It's a years worth of demand.
2350 2018-10-09 19:47:55 Arnica oil massaged into a bruise lessens the length of the purple blue phase...
2351 2018-10-09 19:47:54 You would be burning more oil to go to war than the oil you would be able to get.

2353 2018-10-09 19:47:45 Merci aux premiers intervenants pour leur réponse rapide à l’incident survenu hier à la raffinerie Irving Oil à Saint John. Nous sommes reconnaissants que personne n'ait été gravement blessé.
2354 2018-10-09 19:47:33 Really though what are you going to do with 20L of cooking oil. A whole drum. Kana kusisina chikafu what will you fry. A month’s supply makes sense cause that is already on your budget.
2355 2018-10-09 19:47:29 Thank you to the first responders for their swift response to yesterday’s incident at the Irving Oil Refinery in Saint John. We are thankful no one was seriously injured.
2356 2018-10-09 19:47:29 Going to war takes tons of resources especially oil.

2360 2018-10-09 19:47:05 Like I said while in Jail, there’s not enough oil to actually go to war.

2369 2018-10-09 19:46:13 If you were baking on #veganweek of #gbbo would you be using #vegan margarine, or coconut oil? They seem to be the favourite options for the bakers to use! - LH
2370 2018-10-09 19:46:10 Not a chance that we'll run out of fossil fuels unless we abandoned all research and development of alternative energy sources. We'll have fusion up and running well before we could ever hit peak oil. Not to mention, if it did happen, it would spur more investment in alternatives

2379 2018-10-09 19:45:18 yes, oil sands and shale oil being the two prime exhibits of "unconventional oil" - oil that has a high cost of production and involves burning a lot of oil to extract it.

2406 2018-10-09 19:43:19 either way, with the aid of several EU countries and the U.S., the refugees are escaping from a hell created by the allied powers of big oil and a capitalist state.  the refugees from the African continent need our help, not our scorn.
2407 2018-10-09 19:43:16 Translation; I'm firmly in the pocket of big oil. We'll rape the land and all our national treasures to make sure you can fill your gas guzzler tanks. Never mind that internal combustion engines are obsolete. We must stay firmly grounded in the past!
2408 2018-10-09 19:43:13 CBD oil really has saved my mind.

2410 2018-10-09 19:43:12 Yes the British hypocrite rulers seemingly challenge the Saudis, yet they turn a blind eye on the atrocities that they commit in Yemen and inside their own soil and Turkey recently. They need their oil and multi billion dollar arms deals and other projects!!

2419 2018-10-09 19:42:16 The perception from folks in SS and SE is that Northern Nigeria cannot survive a month without proceeds from crude oil. However, in comparison, Northern Sudan without oil is still standing and flourishing more than South Sudan that has massive oil deposits.

2421 2018-10-09 19:42:00 Dear Gwyneth: You can disagree with the "pseudoscience claims" all you like only... it's barely even pseudoscience. It's repeatedly disproven snake oil. It's not a matter of opinion either. You're just outright wrong. And, sometimes, even dangerous.
2422 2018-10-09 19:41:29 Oh lord really?? Do u use baby oil to take it off or a damp towel?
2423 2018-10-09 19:41:04 Short term is always difficult to draw a conclusion.  

23 Months after Trump election - DOW Jones is up 42% and TSX is up 8% - and oil, which heavily influences TSX is up 65%.  

That's a long enough trend to prove that Trudeau has been a disaster.

2430 2018-10-09 19:40:27 So do you concede we would have a substantially smaller ‘defence’ budget?

& a significant new energy revenue stream

& ALL oil & gas from the North Sea

A net exporter

& AAA credit rating, an asset backed economy & the ability to raise sovereign debt

Like every other country
2431 2018-10-09 19:40:23 You can only hear "big oil is killing our planet!" so many times without seeing anyone in a position to do something about it do something about it before youre just like "we get it. The ovens too hot and you want to tear down oil energy commerce. But the moneys too good right?"
2432 2018-10-09 19:40:12 In other words sell gold reserve to try to hold falling Rupee. Instead of asking govt to take measures like not bailing out crony capitalist, not take too much tax on oil. Increase the internet in long term investment so people can invest in Rupee etc...
2433 2018-10-09 19:40:11 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
2434 2018-10-09 19:39:59 #ClimateChange My two action plans from today’s further reading are: 1) use my re-usable coffee cup everyday (easy win), and 2) support #reforestation . And 3) Tomoz I’ll figure out how I can actually do the latter. 

Bit stuck on ideas for lobbying against oil&gas 
2435 2018-10-09 19:39:42 The world will send big tankers to collect the Scottish Oil.
2436 2018-10-09 19:39:36 British Columbian are buying oil from the US. As a result of this they are paying the highest gas prices ever in history! Also, Canada imported almost $21 billion in Saudi oil over 10 years. Plus, Canada is  less than 2% of global emissions.
2437 2018-10-09 19:39:36 IPCC credibility
Oil companies real actions
U.S. negligence
2438 2018-10-09 19:39:34 Substance abuse counselor? Are you certified or licensed because you sound inept?  Quite amazing how little you know about the benefits of CBD oil and medical cannabis and how legalization would help suffering Americans.   EDUCATE YOURSELF!
2439 2018-10-09 19:39:30 That back those shoulders need oil and my hands massaging 
2440 2018-10-09 19:39:17 The oil industry will no longer pay them to attack the RFS?
2441 2018-10-09 19:39:13 There's always an element of oil industry interest in all Middle East geopolitics.
2442 2018-10-09 19:39:12 I think it matters who will break first. If China gives up and lets its currency fall, we will get a global slowdown, lower oil prices and a recession in China. If China fights on we will get a recession in the US. In 2011 China won, yet the US has now a better position.
2443 2018-10-09 19:39:10 oil bhe lgwya lana
2444 2018-10-09 19:38:54 U do know there is nothing called egg oil or chips oil, it's just fish oil.... sorry for your allergies next time tell them to use olive oil
2445 2018-10-09 19:38:46 Also I know you said no meds - but on the natural side look into CBD oil. It’s incredible for anxiety.
2446 2018-10-09 19:38:40 Well... it's true, you are. Now lets watch as you take away womens rights and defund their health care, drill for oil in national parks, burn money, destabalize the world and set the country back 100 years. It's ok, we're going to fix your mess later.
2447 2018-10-09 19:38:31 Been trying to change my oil the last 2 days and the shop that changed it before put the drain plug on so tight I can’t get it off. I even tried beating the hell out of the wrench with a hammer & nothing. Ugh.
2448 2018-10-09 19:38:30 So you finish changing my oil & instead of driving it up you take it to the back. WHAT THE FUCK. Bring me my car so I can go about my business.
2449 2018-10-09 19:38:30 Gummies honestly were the best for me lol more of a reaction from those than any oil or drops.
2450 2018-10-09 19:38:20 Cathy Give it a rest!
Canada’s a fart in a windstorm of global emissions. Talk to China 1.2 Billion people & India 1.1 Billion. Canada only 36 Million. Talk to USA an Ont & Que source for Oil & They increased Coal mining as did BC for USA export . BTW Alberta banned Coal Mining.
2451 2018-10-09 19:38:15 Lot of cheap shit on the market tho mate. Heard of some bastards just putting olive oil in.  Make sure you get it off a descent company
2452 2018-10-09 19:38:07 So.

I've run the dishwasher, taken the dogs for outside time, did three loads of laundry, made 2 batches of medibles & a vape oil, had a lunch, took care of the trash, and portioned some meat for the freezer.

I can haz nap now?
2453 2018-10-09 19:38:06 2- $ is mostly required for energy imports; sanctions hit Iran will be desperate to barter both gas and oil. Switch away from Kuwait & Saudia. Apart from life saving medicines nothing should be imported and even those should be 'forced' into local production. Viva Protectionism!
2454 2018-10-09 19:38:05 Azul says: RT RepBarragan: DefendOurFuture EPA Oil and gas drilling are one of the leading causes of climate change, and our communities—ones such as Wilmington, Carson, and Compton—all bear the brunt of these drilling operations first and worst. #CA44 #ProtectMadreTierra
2455 2018-10-09 19:37:54 Postmodern art,, your eyes made them beautiful,, where is your coffee
2456 2018-10-09 19:37:46 She used her heritage of  indian as leverage for U.S to stop buying oil from Iran . I don't like her .
2457 2018-10-09 19:37:35 Dear oil and coal companies: start investing heavily in technology to extract and bury carbon from the air into the deep crust, and you’ll be all set to keep making money by the time we completely stop using fossil fuels and coal. Foresight is everything.
2458 2018-10-09 19:37:26 The government doesn’t want people on these lands that’s why they landlocked them with private owners they want to control the natural resources so no one can get at them oil gold silver coal platinum all kinds of minerals and wildlife but yet Hillary sold uranium to Russia
2459 2018-10-09 19:37:08 I like to use apple sauce or banana in lots of bakes . You can also use chia seeds , plant based milk, coconut oil, avocado, orange juice and apple cider vinegar to name a few as substitutes 
2460 2018-10-09 19:36:54 Lovely ,, sweet
2461 2018-10-09 19:36:48 I am sure he will get a stern talking to.
Some things are just, you know, well, not right.
Thanks for the oil.
2462 2018-10-09 19:36:42 Why wouldn’t I, I’m gonna need that oil if I’m rockin a mecha suit
2463 2018-10-09 19:36:37 What Will said! 
2464 2018-10-09 19:36:27 Aaaaaaaa oil 
2465 2018-10-09 19:36:18 We ate the boom together. You can't eat your cake and have it. How much do you think will be spent on subsidy if oil sells at 100dpb and PMS price is N87? The infrastructure APC is working on where do you think the money to start them come from? Most are 80-90% completed by PDP.
2466 2018-10-09 19:35:50 Ok.  And let's get rid of subsidies for oil companies, and farmers and ranchers too
2467 2018-10-09 19:35:47 Guess which idiot didn't close his packed lunch properly? My bag now reeks of olive oil. Luckily I wasn't carrying any books but it did touch my laptop and now my cute guilty kiss sticker is destroyed, internals are fine though :(
2468 2018-10-09 19:35:47 I am burning the midnight oil tonight. Not working but checking the prices of the products on offer during #TheBigBillionDays by @Flipkart. It’s worth it!
2469 2018-10-09 19:35:45 Louisiana has some of the highest cancer rates in the country. Regulating emissions from our factories and oil refineries is essential to our people.
2470 2018-10-09 19:35:33 Traveling diaries of the snake oil salesmen.
2471 2018-10-09 19:35:21 Because oil companies have seen in Europe if you can get a population to accept that energy should be expensive you can gouge the hell out of the prices, even when mostly tax:
US Gas: $2.80 add 20 cent - WTF  
EU Gas: $6.00 add 20 cent - shrug 
2472 2018-10-09 19:35:21 Oil change went tf up 
2473 2018-10-09 19:35:19 I hate the way Jamaican black castor oil smells
2474 2018-10-09 19:35:15 @realDonaldTrump USD and Oil movement will certainly hurt the India import from US, which will impact US growth, this time, import will get reduced.  Oil movement is not fair as it impact common people.  Hence, request your intervention in arresting USD and Oil movement
2475 2018-10-09 19:35:04 Yeah - Go and check the Channel Islands and the Isle of Mann - all within the 12 nmile limits.

Shetland would be exactly the same - No Oil.
2476 2018-10-09 19:35:01 oil mill was the worst. 8am, feet in mud, gross old man's hand on your bum, smirking at you 
2477 2018-10-09 19:34:56 If we struck oil I'd say we'd still have to pay USC!
2478 2018-10-09 19:34:50 Oil Prices rose on growing evidence of falling crude exports from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, before the imposition of new U.S. sanctions and a partial shutdown in the Gulf of Mexico because of Hurricane Michael.
2479 2018-10-09 19:34:38 Yes o he need to steep down for spending tax payer money  in  a London hospital close to whopping 185 day, for unprecedented nepotism shown in security appointment in a supposed federal state, for Mainna scam, for grass cutter scam, for paying oil subsidy and 25billon  nnpc scam
2480 2018-10-09 19:34:32 And to insure that Sioux territories will be polluted by big oil.
2481 2018-10-09 19:34:32 1-Economy will not improve without radical policies; no one has the capacity or courage to do that in Pakistan. Non essential imports and foreign currency expenditure must be curtailed even Oil & gas imports must be renegotiated for export of Pak products of same value!
2482 2018-10-09 19:34:21 vape oil. Please I must see
2483 2018-10-09 19:34:18 The world is aware of the failings of this administration concerning climate change. This administration has removed many EPA regulations that protect our environment.Trump has increased our carbon footprint-w coal&oil industry,Trump withdrew us from Paris treaty.
2484 2018-10-09 19:34:09 Just left from getting that damn oil change 
2485 2018-10-09 19:34:06 But we have minimal if any oil/gas production.  Alberta is the only province that really gives'er and thats nothing compared to others if these graphs are right.  Logically we have the least people so we're doing the least damage. maybe the logging is doing more damage, I dunno
2486 2018-10-09 19:34:06 @realFemiOtedola Sir, I have a proposal for partnership which will help to increase Forte Oil's lubricants' market share. It's been difficult getting through to a decision maker. I hope you'd give me the opportunity sir.

2494 2018-10-09 19:33:45 What was the total cost of Gulf Coast damage when Barack Obama allowed Deep Water Horizon to continue to spill crude oil for three months?
2495 2018-10-09 19:33:42 There are also vape cartridges of CBD oil
2496 2018-10-09 19:33:29 Oil money oil money but you no fit pay teachers, midwives and pensioners.
2497 2018-10-09 19:33:28 Currently, there has been no research into CBD oil for #NEAD. There is an ongoing inquiry into its efficacy for Epilepsy and other conditions. Recommend you discuss with your doctor first.
2498 2018-10-09 19:33:28 I knows  I’ll resemble a Halloween skeleton by then at this rate. Refused fish offerings last night & pasta that had coconut oil drizzled on it  I was only 25.4kg on Sunday

2505 2018-10-09 19:32:45 At Kokoa, we love a coconut!  
This magical fruit has so many properties that we think make it effective for skin! 
From a moisturiser for your skin and lips, to managing your psoriasis, it can help treat many skin ailments. You can find it in our Shea & Coconut Oil Whip! 
2506 2018-10-09 19:32:39 Can I get some recommendations for a cream or oil to fade a scar?   Thank you

2508 2018-10-09 19:32:33 Nothing that fancy! I just melted the oil, mixed everything in then put it in a muffin tin in the freezer to set - I thought one of these in the shower might be less messy? Haven't tried one yet though..

2515 2018-10-09 19:32:24 More worrying/infuriating was the fact the NHS (ie taxpayers) used to fund it. I think they’ve stopped now. At least people have a choice to buy Gwynnies snake oil.
2516 2018-10-09 19:32:14 If you eat squash at home (acorn, butternut, ect) don't forget to toast the seeds. 250F for 20 minutes with a little oil and salt. 
They are delicious.
Add other flavors if you want (chili is good).

2519 2018-10-09 19:32:08 Tax cuts for millionaires are expensive too...so are oil and gas subsidies. At least some of the programs they propose help those who don't buy yachts or private jets.
2520 2018-10-09 19:32:05 U are abusing the word panicking ,I don't any see mistake or anything wrong of purchasing cooking oil whilst it's $8 waiting to buy at $15 let's be rational guys I have to buy early cz I know latter zvinokwira
2521 2018-10-09 19:32:03 I just bought a Honda CRV I have read lately there is a problem with the gas and oil mixing together and will make car stall especial when it is cold and on a short trip. If this was known before I bought why did they not tell me. I have been driving a Vibe for 12 years.

2527 2018-10-09 19:31:12 You want them to charge 50c then they go buy bread for $1.30 and cooking oil for $12. Where will they get the money to cater for the increases in the prices of basic commodities.  Economic measures should be taken to deal with inflation not protesting against them 
2528 2018-10-09 19:31:05 Oil is the nectar of the gods!!!

2530 2018-10-09 19:30:55 In the 1980s and early 1990s I had teachers and professors telling us we were running out of oil. Then NYC and other cities would be underwater. Then all the polar bears will die. Repealing net neutrality will kill us. Electing @realDonaldTrump will start a nuclear war. Yawn.

7. Listen to the fans!
8. And most importantly... Bring a PPV to the UK!
2537 2018-10-09 19:30:16 Are you not conversant with jicho pevu show that exposed ills in our society ranging from corruption,  nepotism, smuggling to terrorism? The narrative has changed but the person remained the same albeit in a position of power. Still not clear. Oil and water r mixing. ruto+moha
2538 2018-10-09 19:30:13 I would like to be trained in case of major oil spill - are there trainings  just for that?
2539 2018-10-09 19:30:05 Let Scotland go, tear up the Barnet Formula. See how long they last if they have to stand on their own 2 feet. Once the north sea oil runs out they’d be fucked. Ungrateful c****s!
2540 2018-10-09 19:30:04 well it would destroy the profit motive of oil companies cause we'd nationalize that shit and begin the transition to clean energy
2541 2018-10-09 19:30:03 The thought of going to oil mill market, even though I have not been there in 9 years, still makes me panic...Sometimes I wonder how I have not stabbed all the men around me
2542 2018-10-09 19:30:01 That’s why I introduced H.R. 4246, the #NoDrillinginOurBackyardsAct, to ensure that oil and gas operations in the United States occurs at least 1.5K feet away from homes, businesses, school and other protected areas. #ActonClimate
2543 2018-10-09 19:29:47 You guys are mad jealous of our lavish life style in Saudi Arabia. No taxes, high income. Stop hating and work hard so you can make more money. May be you should pressure your government to build your Energy East pipeline to be able to get rich with oil
2544 2018-10-09 19:29:46 How much money have you accepted from oil and energy producers?
2545 2018-10-09 19:29:39 I ALREADY COPYRIGHTED ‘SILICON SNAKE OIL 2.0: CYBERCOLONIALISM’. IF YOU WANT TO TITLE YOUR OWN BOOK THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ME FOR THE LICENSE, SO I CAN PAY OFF THE FEES FOR USING ‘SILICON SNAKE OIL’
2546 2018-10-09 19:29:28 nothing at top of list.
but good time to do some homework
some obvious contra would be ones that have fallen >50% + good long term prospects.. eg. airlines sector.. but oil needs to go drop 50% for story to pan out
2547 2018-10-09 19:29:22 Reading comments here where people seem to take "climate change" seriously is depressing.  Why are people so gullible as to fall for Malthusean non-sense?  I've lived through "Population Bomb", nuclear winter, ozone hole, and peak oil - catastrophes that never happened.

2552 2018-10-09 19:29:01 They know consumers will pay the tax anyway and would gladly trade lobbying heft with democrats now for long term oil demand destruction 10 years from now. Fucking stupid.
2553 2018-10-09 19:29:00 The real question is.. is it oil or oil
2554 2018-10-09 19:29:00 Fastest growing economy indeed with our external reserved depleted and industries leaving our shores in droves, criminally job creating ventures everywhere (staffs of oil subsidy thieves and kola aluko jobs everywhere). Now is real time jobs real economy growth robust reserve
2555 2018-10-09 19:28:54 I know! But I won’t question it as long as it’s cheap hah  EVERYTHING is cheaper oil changes are $10 if u do them yourself and gas is less than $5 a week  get a moped 
2556 2018-10-09 19:28:44 Yours? Like the oil?
2557 2018-10-09 19:28:36 Children are particularly susceptible to the health impacts from oil and gas pollution, which has created a public health crisis leaving them suffering from asthma and respiratory problems; nosebleeds; and nausea. #ActonClimate
2558 2018-10-09 19:28:29 So CNN says make some small sacrifices to contribute to a better outcome and immediately the answer is NO!  Not that. 

Let’s attack the oil industry, seize the state, nationalize consumables so the government can ration and determine proper use thresholds.

2559 2018-10-09 19:28:26 Israel give us Guns/equipments/military supplies. We give them food.

2561 2018-10-09 19:28:17 The only disbuted waters are the English/Scottish North Sea limits as Scottish waters were secretly transferred on the eve of the Scottish Parliment reopening by Donald Dewar. 

Scotland will be looking for these back along with the oil fields.

2563 2018-10-09 19:28:07 I saw it and was wondering which slaves applied baby oil...
2564 2018-10-09 19:28:07 yes you! ahahah  we should honestly get together especially with @EmmaKalo and just have an oil talk day and make a few blends lol 
2565 2018-10-09 19:27:57 best bumper sticker I remember from the 80's " Lord please give us another oil boom, we promise not to screw this one up"
2566 2018-10-09 19:27:52 Lavender oil works well also
2567 2018-10-09 19:27:51 Our families should be able to live and work in schools and neighborhoods that are safe from toxic air pollution emitted from oil and gas operations. #ProtectMadreTierra
2568 2018-10-09 19:27:45 We call that “checking the oil”
2569 2018-10-09 19:27:41 There goes Suhasin once a Hindu, now waiting anxiously to seen from day to day how the level of Iranian oil imports to India go up and down, blossoming into a smile when it goes up, despairing if it drops, waiting for the big TALKS with great old irreplaceable Paaaaakistan..
2570 2018-10-09 19:27:40 Need the oil
2571 2018-10-09 19:27:35 One more reason offshore oil wells are stupid. This administration is for short term profits as apposed to long term solutions

2573 2018-10-09 19:27:25 Them coconut oil merch
2574 2018-10-09 19:27:17 You also left out the fact that oil industry is underproducing because Saudi Arabia is articifically keeping prices low to please the US. This has brought about hardship but the levels of hunger and poverty are still nothing like the way the way before Chavez was elected.
2575 2018-10-09 19:27:10 $CPG Flesh that out for us @JJ62. Lenders going to call in their loans? Oil dips to $10/bbl? CPG says just kidding about planned changes?
2576 2018-10-09 19:27:06 My boss is making us come in ON A SUNDAY to set up for the Oil Show 
2577 2018-10-09 19:27:00 I love how you just master graphite, oil and and now ink. This is SO GOOD.
2578 2018-10-09 19:26:50 Q5: You've also worked to protect communities in your district from oil and gas pollution. Can you tell us about that?

2581 2018-10-09 19:26:45 Came home early from work. Feeling like a zombie. Time for a hot shower with all the eucalyptus oil and then lavender lotion and some replying to all the messages and emails I left on read 
2582 2018-10-09 19:26:30 Oil and powder cant stop us !!!!
2583 2018-10-09 19:26:29 For a story that gruesome to be discussed by several people, there has to be a basis of truth to it. It could be true. Wouldn't put it past the Saudis to resort to the  barbaric in order to get their own way. That oil and that money buys them a lot of leeway.
2584 2018-10-09 19:26:28 Because you can turn rocks into oil. Duh! TBH, I don't even know why we use the word fossil anyways. A lot of the "fossils" we find aren't fossilized, lol.
2585 2018-10-09 19:26:15 In SW VA, I've seen "Stop the Pipeline" and "MAGA" signs in the same yard, from people more concerned about eminent domain abuse and oil leaks than global warming.

2587 2018-10-09 19:26:11 It amazes me how much money guys spend on their trucks  I can’t even keep up with my oil changes 
2588 2018-10-09 19:26:10 Went from wing sauce stains to oil stains on my jeans. 
2589 2018-10-09 19:26:06 —; use oil paint only in open rooms and be careful of paint thinner.

Also it can crack through other layers depending on application and process.

Art supplies have improved. They have certain acrylics that are plenty good. Overexposure to toxins isn’t good.
2590 2018-10-09 19:26:05 Oil & gas drilling does not belong in our neighborhoods. In my district #CA44, there are oil wells next to parks and in backyards where kids play. Health impacts from oil & gas operations such as asthma, cardiovascular, respiratory & even cancer problems must be addressed.
2591 2018-10-09 19:25:53 He said he will diversify...he said we will no longer depend solely on oil.that is supposed to be a change agenda...why are crying more than the bereaved?
2592 2018-10-09 19:25:45 We dont need a student loan bailout. The problem is the education system it self and how it is structured. If you want to fix student debt that is fairly easily done through add a limited time tax bracket for people in debt and adding 3-15% tax on oil and tech imports

2595 2018-10-09 19:25:43 #SuezCanal 1957 action against a sovereign state of Egypt against British and French imperialism for oil. 9 years after the creation of the Jewish State of Israel, Britain/France colluded with Israel to attack Egypt. Israel invaded first and Britain/France followed suit
2596 2018-10-09 19:25:42 The president of chick-fil-a met me personally and decided I was the anti-christ and that's why chick-fil-a uses peanut oil
2597 2018-10-09 19:25:35 US and UK have just confirmed their unwavering pledge to protect the Saudis to the last drop of their oil. Another Saudi killed, is not going to change any policies, considering Saudi Arabia routinely hangs about 150 guy and gall pa.
2598 2018-10-09 19:25:29 My maintenance consists of using it. I wash with soap only. Vim when it gets gunky. Then use a little oil and a cut onion or potato to re season before making the next round of dosas.
2599 2018-10-09 19:25:26 Y’all I told my stepmom ( @owlsrock247 ) my oil diffuser wasn’t working.... guess what is coming in the mail Thursday  y’all I’m blessed

2601 2018-10-09 19:25:05 You don’t think the GM’s actions (trades and signings) play a bigger role? I’m more worried about Chia pulling the trigger on a trade that may hinder the #oilers sooner rather than later. #yikes
2602 2018-10-09 19:25:02 That requires $BB in Coker upgrades to refineries to process tar Sands oil. A country like India is better off investing in next gen energy.

2604 2018-10-09 19:24:55 Wowowowowow. I always was curious about fish oil, I used to take it blindly and stopped because you know I’m weird about fish lol. But that makes a lot of sense, definitely will have to look into it
2605 2018-10-09 19:24:54 Or at least tell her that brand of baby oil might be carcinogenic 
2606 2018-10-09 19:24:53 1.  60% cost of gasoline today...
2.  smog disappeared once containment areas adopted e10
3.  ask american lung association
4.  oil comes back?
5.  not saying peak, just saying getting more expensive per unit of energy
6.  ah...WRONG.  Net exporter to brazil
7.  come to adams
2607 2018-10-09 19:24:42 i got up today & was at least happy when i looked in the mirror bc the bio oil is healing the scar on my cheek visibly, got to work, no makeup but decided to put a dab of concealer on my chin just bc lil redness, team leader comments on my skin asking whats wrong w/ it —
2608 2018-10-09 19:24:39 Loosening this regulation increases the risk of devastating oil spills that threaten the environment, thriving fishing, tourism & recreation. I will always fight to protect our pristine coastlines and the livelihoods of our communities.

2611 2018-10-09 19:24:33 This reminds me of when VP Hoynes decided to give a speech exorciating the oil industry and Toby couldn’t figure out why he would go to bat for President Bartlett like that. Then he and Leo realized Hoynes believed Bartlett wasn’t running for re-election. WW ref, don’t @ me.
2612 2018-10-09 19:24:32 I enjoy shrimp alfredo, I love to dice up some button mushrooms and soak them in garlic infused olive oil before adding them to the sauce with spiced sausage and herbs.
2613 2018-10-09 19:24:29 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on it's board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada.
2614 2018-10-09 19:24:25 This is mainly caused by Coal/Oil and Petroleum companies. We've been researching to find greener solutions, but once we go completely green, this problem wouldn't exist anymore. We just need to come up with solutions.

2619 2018-10-09 19:23:42 Yes. Whatever they used instead of oil feels even oilier!

2621 2018-10-09 19:23:31 That’s always a valid concern, but it doesn’t trump the concerns of throttling. 

Large corporations are very good at delaying new methods if they’ve invested heavily in the old ones. We’ve seen that with the oil companies.

People should have access to the basics of modern life.
2622 2018-10-09 19:23:28 I’d recommend reading scientific peer reviewed articles on the topic...but mainly we don’t know what the fish are fed so we don’t know if omega-3 is actually even in the oil, you also are not avoiding PCBs or mercury with the oil
2623 2018-10-09 19:23:22 Alberta oil prices collapsing because of failed NDP policy and Notley , predictably, plays the identity politics card and the media eats it up.

2627 2018-10-09 19:23:14 Well, I suppose this stuff balances out doesn’t it. I mean the whole oil revenue thing swung this transfer round the other way for years. But yes, a useful thread.
2628 2018-10-09 19:23:02 To soften your hands, rub your hands with warm olive oil, leave it on for 5-7 minutes, and rinse off with warm water.
2629 2018-10-09 19:23:02 Oil is deeply affecting housing TOL - 2.58% (Toll brothers) and car markets Ford F - 3% and GM - 5%. The big if is now how long China will be selling USD to finance ever higher oil bills. What will break first? China or the US housing and car market? #OOTT
2630 2018-10-09 19:22:56 What’s sad is it that it takes the opposition parties in both Alberta and Ottawa to discuss our resource sector with potential trading partners like India. Trudeau refuses to push our oil and gas sector.
2631 2018-10-09 19:22:47 Really interesting. I had heard that colloidal silver could be helpful but had not thought of cedarwood oil to deal with the pain. My 2 yr old scratched my eye a while back and it was extremely painful and I would have tried this natural remedy. Hopefully I won't ever need to ;)

2633 2018-10-09 19:22:33 TFW you get new brakes (pads & rotors) all around, a new muffler, a new drive belt, an oil change and inspection, and it all costs less than how much you paid at the old shop for a new distributor and plug-wires.

2636 2018-10-09 19:22:23 Oceans will eventually be too plastic contaminated...food and water will become scarce all because oil companies are money hungry monsters that won’t change to alternative energy. The planet is in bad shape and no one gives a damn until it’s too late.....
2637 2018-10-09 19:22:21 Sorry to be fundermentally pessimistic here, but I do not know the answer, oil is what gives the us Dollar value, and it’s why it’s the reserve currency. In order to change the order of things, one would have to smash that, and I really don’t know how - answer?

2641 2018-10-09 19:21:45 I'm still experimenting with my other skin rejuvenating products, but adding the rosehip oil morning and night has made a visible difference. I may just include this in a YouTube video. Even my facialist remarked on how different and more lifted my skin looked after 2 weeks use.

2645 2018-10-09 19:21:35 I agree 100% on the knowing the charges statement.  With that said, I think health insurance should be just that, insurance.  For catastrophic reasons only.  To compare to a car, not every oil change or tire change.  Pay the rest out of pocket.
2646 2018-10-09 19:21:29 What were you doing with hot oil
2647 2018-10-09 19:21:26 Cloave oil makes sense. It is a local anaesthetic. Why didn't I think of that? #SexTalkTuesday
2648 2018-10-09 19:21:21 I recommend tamanu oil for healing and anything else pertaining to skin and skin conditions! Also Chinese herbal ointments are also the plug
2649 2018-10-09 19:21:20 1. no. at best a wash
2. no. smog, upside down energy wise.
3. debatable
4. you burn it, it doesn't come back.

7. technology no newer than ancient Egypt.
2650 2018-10-09 19:21:19 I thought I noticed oil slicks on the red carpet.  Oh, it's just them.
2651 2018-10-09 19:21:16 The answer is... complicated. Is a village near an oil reserve that can't tap and monetize that resource exploited if in exchange for the oil rights they get roads a school and a hospital? What if those rights are sold by the government and that village sees no financial benefit?

2653 2018-10-09 19:20:53 I don't disagree. 

Was curious about it because O&G is not exclusive from Canada and how that impacts price helps drive adoption for other technologies (high price of oil did help push a lot of greener technologies for example).
2654 2018-10-09 19:20:53 Q4: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke recently announced a plan to roll back oil and gas safety rules that were implemented in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon spill. Can you explain why you’re opposed to this plan?

2656 2018-10-09 19:20:47 They had 16 freaking years.

They had the years of high oil earnings.

They had several tranches of the Abacha loot returned.

But no, they chose to open our treasury to their friends and cronies and robbed us blind while we spiralled into a recession as a result.

2684 2018-10-09 19:18:57 We’ve been over the horizontal lines...same as with USO vs crude oil or GLD vs gold.  Collateralized stablecoins are arbitraged against underlying.  Uncollateralized have market makers trading tightly around 1, totally rationally.  This isn’t evidence against fraud,

2687 2018-10-09 19:18:45 Raising oil taxes (MET) doesn’t raise enuf to cover spending plan of extra RUB2trn/yr x6yrs. Yes oil is $84 now budget assumption increase but only to $55. Hence need more tax hence VAT hike. Minfin being conservative as it shld.
2688 2018-10-09 19:18:38 Sullys white fur is now oil stained  why do cats have to mess about under parked cars  scruff 
2689 2018-10-09 19:18:29 What will their carbon tax emissions fine be? it should be much higher for roque Venezuela oil
2690 2018-10-09 19:18:27 Typical. The snakeoil salesmen pointing the finger at the Dr and crying snake oil salesmen. I'd love to see the two in a debate. Brain to brain.
2691 2018-10-09 19:17:56 Another flaw is that, in some ministries (like oil), fixing big strategic problems requires political clout. Iraq’s political class may generally be ossified and corrupt, but that doesn’t mean politicians are ipso facto bad Cabinet ministers.
2692 2018-10-09 19:17:55 You posted this at 440AM LOL. That's still super early. Have you tried CBD oil to help you sleep?
2693 2018-10-09 19:17:35 Moisturize with Jamaican castor oil. It will fill in the gaps
2694 2018-10-09 19:17:34 I truly am basic in the sense of a nice calming bath with white noise and candles and a coconut rub down afterwards. Valerian has helped but it stinks and also I want to try CBD oil soon
2695 2018-10-09 19:17:32 A monopoly on ADAM makes Standard Oil look like bones.
2696 2018-10-09 19:17:20 We were led to an angel with a row of cauterized nubs that attempted to flit around fruitlessly, made of oil. It opened its gaping mouth.
2697 2018-10-09 19:17:15 I ain’t never putting oil on my feet again. I literally just flew out of my shoes 
2698 2018-10-09 19:17:11 We know he's after his oil well
2699 2018-10-09 19:17:09 Yeah you are quite restrained I guess mate. 
But how long will it last before u mention oil, human rights, plastics, no atmosphere, small club, no fans??  
2700 2018-10-09 19:17:06 Looooooooool all the other stuff is so obvious though. But imagine being grey no matter how much Shea butter/coconut oil you use. I’d be livid
2701 2018-10-09 19:17:03 Marco done got my car cleaned and my oil change oh he want some pussy pussy 
2702 2018-10-09 19:17:00 Baby oil and alkaline water got my eczema disappearing.. Thank TMH
2703 2018-10-09 19:16:59 Becareful with CBD oil some strains can increase anxiety ..  make sure you use the correct strains ..
2704 2018-10-09 19:16:57 oil paint is something else...
2705 2018-10-09 19:16:53 No deadass cuz I know how much you race peppermint oil. That was our thing. But if you say something about astroboy I’m sending a search party
2706 2018-10-09 19:16:51 Although if you look at the DOW right now - it is up.  the TSX is down.  

Another headlines might have been "TSX down again despite oil gains"  "TSX up only 8% since Trump taken over, despite 65% increase in oil - DOW Jones up 42% in same time".
2707 2018-10-09 19:16:44 Yeah my life may be falling apart but at least I have a new oil diffuser that makes my room smell like oranges
2708 2018-10-09 19:16:43 Man it's not October if I don't take a bath good ol bath in oil
2709 2018-10-09 19:16:41 As soon as I  get my milleage checks I'm gonna treat my car to an oil change, I'm switching out my breaks, and buying 2 new tires... poor baby.. shes dirty too 
2710 2018-10-09 19:16:41 자연스러워 보이는진 몰것더
2711 2018-10-09 19:16:29 Not a chance  if I’m having a cookie, I’m having a full butter/chocolate feast  I refuse to believe that coconut oil is nice in shortcrust pastry 
2712 2018-10-09 19:16:26 Which indicates that the oil companies are ripping off consumers in the South Island and Wellington. If there was Gull then we would have a sudden decrease in prices
2713 2018-10-09 19:16:24 And after eating the vadai, bavs said she can use that oil on her child’s head for one month 
2714 2018-10-09 19:16:18 Cheaper per mile traveled

environmentally friendly vs. alternative.

more complete combustion - healthier (less particulates)

renewable

production of raw goods increasing with less inputs, versus oil depletion

Locally produced

the next step to future fuels.
2715 2018-10-09 19:16:17 Have already cut back on the meat consumption. Family down to only one car. Light rail will be in our community soon. But most importantly, the way to help is to #VOTE2018 for candidates who acknowledge that this crisis is REAL and who are not in the pocket of big oil and gas.
2716 2018-10-09 19:16:10 Any word about the billions our oil gives England.
2717 2018-10-09 19:16:09 A stew is the combination of Atarodo + Tomato and Onions grinded by pepper Grater 2give u the combination of the 3 together, poured inside a frying pan on a Gas which already contains hot Red oil or Groundnut oil diluted with a lil salt et Maggie + dry crayfish 
2718 2018-10-09 19:16:03 Olive oil uthi yiWine
2719 2018-10-09 19:15:48 not exactly, what is dirty oil? All oil is brought up from the ground and oil all over the world has to go through an extraction process to clean it.
Shale Oil in the US would be the hardest to extract but the miss-information coming from the US would make you think otherwise.
2720 2018-10-09 19:15:48 I have already paid for my tickets for this con in Chicago but I’m not sure I can actually afford the oil change necessary to get there.
2721 2018-10-09 19:15:48 That African black soap &  oil have my skin flawless
2722 2018-10-09 19:15:43 I’m so poor I’m 5000 miles past needing an oil change
2723 2018-10-09 19:15:29 Vegetable Oil?

2728 2018-10-09 19:15:10 So who gon let me borrow some money for this oil change???
2729 2018-10-09 19:15:08 1 cup flour, half a cup sugar, 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, enough milk to make a thick dough. Spoon a tablespoon at a time in hot oil and fry until golden 
2730 2018-10-09 19:15:06  Avon skin products are it hey, I’m using the nutraeffects oil and I’m so happy, I hardly wear make up even
2731 2018-10-09 19:15:06 Oooooo SEEDS SEEDS SEEDS they also have so many minerals and vitamins and the omega 3s that lots of ppl lack . Also like flax seed oil is a thing ppl drink for health benefits I think ???
2732 2018-10-09 19:15:04 Oh I do love a nice bread with a good olive oil for dipping! ♡
2733 2018-10-09 19:15:02 when he tells you to bend over and you feel that baby oil drip down your ass >
2734 2018-10-09 19:14:59 The fact that females use baby oil as lube is disgusting omg
2735 2018-10-09 19:14:52 This inconvenient truth has been known for decades.  If corrective actions had been taken then, the more extreme measures needed now could've been avoided.
We were warned before it became an emergency and did very little about it.  The GOP & Big Oil carry most of the blame in USA
2736 2018-10-09 19:14:52 Cbd oil and bcaas
2737 2018-10-09 19:14:46 Us is concerned about the safety of arabs?
The annual hanging in Saudi Arabia averages 150 guy and gals killed, so why would one more make any difference?  That's less than 1% increase this year. Negligible. US and UK will continue to protect Saudis to their last drop of oil.
2738 2018-10-09 19:14:29 Rick Ross Ft Jadakiss - Oil Money Gang 
2739 2018-10-09 19:14:23 Your profile says you're Catholic. Pope's official stance: "We know that technology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels – especially coal, but also oil and, to a lesser degree, gas – needs to be progressively replaced without delay" Seems you have a dilemma here.
2740 2018-10-09 19:14:19 "The grooviest and grooviest things in the world cannot be pursued or even pursued - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
2741 2018-10-09 19:14:10 baby oil not lube???????
2742 2018-10-09 19:14:08 True then the next issue will be fair practices because currently Africa is being exploited oil gold minerals
2743 2018-10-09 19:13:58 Which in reality means that nobody is going to challenge the Saudis about this as long as they buy arms from us and we buy oil from them.
2744 2018-10-09 19:13:48 Can't Be Dealing Oil fixes all :)
2745 2018-10-09 19:13:42 "Suckin' the devil's dick for that oil drip" 

 You gotta have Owen Benjamin on @POTPfans weekly @ComicDaveSmith
2746 2018-10-09 19:13:39 She's not lying but she's not saying the complete truth. Most anointing oils are usually olive oil which is good for your hair. Oil in general if applied on the scalp regularly leads to hair growth.

2749 2018-10-09 19:13:25 Hey Caitlyn,
For oily skin I’d recommend the Charcoal & Pink soap set or the Detox Mask to add to your regimen. All 3 contain Bentonite Clay with is great for absorbing oil & removing impurities from skin!
2750 2018-10-09 19:13:24 Also, Big Oil is a factor, obviously.
2751 2018-10-09 19:13:17 It's not even a debate. McLellan certainly has his flaws but the pieces are what they are. Have said it a thousand times but the fact the Oilers have traded their biggest chip & still don't have a No. 1 D-man is unacceptable. That's on the GM.

2754 2018-10-09 19:13:06 ゆきとさん、おはようございます！
2755 2018-10-09 19:13:05 How cool: The Man in the High Castle @HighCastleTV episode 9 is titled Baku.. Feeling homesick now.. Fun fact: serie's theme song Edelweiss was the name of Hitler's operation to capture Baku and its oil fields in 1942.
2756 2018-10-09 19:12:54 The #GOP snake oil has taken on a decidedly odd flavor. They are now actively peddling bottles of "We Won't Listen."
2757 2018-10-09 19:12:39 It’s awesome I love it what company are you using? I use the oil under my tongue before bed. Noticed deeper sleep and feeling less achy in the morning.
2758 2018-10-09 19:12:37 Their rose hip oil is great, too, especially for dry skin and acne! That and the others I recommended definitely helped to even out my skin tone and texture over time + balance my skin moisture!
2759 2018-10-09 19:12:32 Started some within the last month. Balm and oil. Have not noticed much of a difference. I wish you better results. May the hemp lords be on your side.
2760 2018-10-09 19:12:25 well, the reality is that "clean coal" technology does exist.  We just have oil companies dictating our emissions standards, production, etc.

Your words are JUST words.
2763 2018-10-09 19:11:37 I miss carlos working at valvoline and I didn’t have to pay full price for a full synthetic oil change.

2766 2018-10-09 19:11:19 After seeing the 2nd episode of 'That Time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime'? Absolutely not. What an awesome new series. After Goblin Slayer? Give me a knife and Goblin. Gimme oil and a lighter
2767 2018-10-09 19:11:13 SheaMoisture 100% virgin coconut face oil! Its mainly for hydrating before you go to sleep rather than cleansing but they have great hair and skin products

2770 2018-10-09 19:11:00 Like striking oil, you hit paydirt.
2771 2018-10-09 19:10:37 Oil and gas drilling are one of the leading causes of climate change, and our communities—ones such as Wilmington, Carson, and Compton—all bear the brunt of these drilling operations first and worst. #CA44 #ProtectMadreTierra
2772 2018-10-09 19:10:27 Wow , the glycolic acid toner was one I was soo excited to try ! Along with the rose hip oil and some other things . I was looking forward to finally getting my skin right . No hyperpigmentation , even skin tone and not dry etc.   at a affordable price
2773 2018-10-09 19:10:22 Transporting your products is wahala here. For years your goverment did not think of developing our iron horse to improve ease of movement of goods and services. With the high oil revenue accrued no effort make to deveope the existing pipelines and installing new one

2777 2018-10-09 19:09:59 Do you have proof of that, anything to suggest big oil lobbying "swing riding". I must say in true liberal form. When you can't answer a question you resort to insult.  I love when Liberals play right into thier own narrative.
2778 2018-10-09 19:09:55 I mean sure, you could look at this and see someone becoming unhinged from reality. But I see it as proof of what I've always felt about the majority of the far-right, which is that they don't actually believe anything they say and are just cynical snake oil salesmen.
2779 2018-10-09 19:09:36 The City of Los Angeles—where the 44th congressional district that I represent is located—is home to the largest and most densely populated urban oil field in the nation. #ActonClimate
2780 2018-10-09 19:09:36 I just made a poké bowl with shirataki noodles tossed in teriyaki sauce, sesame oil, and soy sauce (I normally do white rice).. I'm on to something here

2784 2018-10-09 19:09:16 You really are very badly informed. 

These island waters are not disputed. They are all controlled by UN conventions.
  
Oil and other resources are owned by the country who controls the continental shelf - not the islands. 

Go and read UNCLOS.

2790 2018-10-09 19:08:57 Your dead right Peter, people don't really want change. Anyone can act to mitigate climate change, they could become the change they want to see and walk or cycle all those short journeys then now do by car. But easier to do nothing and bitch about the evil oil companies.

2792 2018-10-09 19:08:51 When a youth, a graduate keeps saying those candidate don't have money, you need to press further, in Nigeria they mean money to share, to oil their hands so they can support you. Money is a yardstick to good governance to such brains.The earlier you realise you'll keep producing
2793 2018-10-09 19:08:49 Oil change, gas, car wash, new windshield wipers, more antifreeze, tire rotation  I don’t even want a car anymore 
2794 2018-10-09 19:08:30 The RVP waiver is another step.  It has taken at least 6 years to get this step done.  That alone should tell you everything you need to know about Big Oil and Merchant Refiners willingness to give up market share.  Never give up the fight, your opponent will not.  #corn

The other left Customs as Deputy Director & became a

Can @atiku ever get his eyes off Nigeria's treasury? As VP, he bought many national asset 4 hisself

2800 2018-10-09 19:07:46 Re IPCC COP24; It's not quite too late for our species but we did tell you so! Activists have been warning of catastrophe since at least 1979 when the American Petroleum Institute convened meetings with major oil companies on the science.
2801 2018-10-09 19:07:37 @BackBliss Good evening.  Can you use suntan oil with your easy applicator?
2802 2018-10-09 19:07:33 I do! Buffet, B oil, caffeine solution, peeling mask, az whatever stuff. Had a toner that I didn't care for.  Barely used.

2804 2018-10-09 19:07:17 numbers, ask them how many women are roughnecks in the oil patch and waste pickup workers. Seems like equality is only an issue when it's white collar jobs

2806 2018-10-09 19:07:04 If they don't start Happ, albeit w/ an extremely short leash, defeats the entire purpose of going out & trading for him. His resume against the Red Sox speaks for itself, regardless of Game One.

2809 2018-10-09 19:06:26 Never have. Nearly every state has it. Is it necessary? Not in my opinion. Few people utilize it here. Primarily business travelers. Ag, oil, gas, etc. The rest drive to a larger city. Whats crazy they are all over the eastern US where a larger city is always a short drive

2814 2018-10-09 19:05:59 While I don't disagree, I think we have the ratio wrong: the expense should be in taxes, not oil company profits which go straight to off-shore fat cats.
2815 2018-10-09 19:05:57 At least its pay week...
I've gotta pay for my car, get an oil change, send money to friends, and pay my phone bill.

2831 2018-10-09 19:04:26 Oga can you also compare the exchange rates at these different times and let's know the highest and by implication which person has earned more over the same quantity of oil.
2832 2018-10-09 19:04:23 I’d be really appreciative if as a journalist you could do some research into the current economics of Oil. Why when prices and production are so high ,costs so low , and the dollar/sterling FX so advantageous revenue is almost 0. Not just regurgitating UK govt and media lines
2833 2018-10-09 19:04:22 Lol great minds think alike bruh, I was referring to the salan my dad made its 60% oil and 40% actual salan
2834 2018-10-09 19:04:20 You’d just better hope Norway never runs out of oil, darling. Or that ecowarriors don’t shut down whaling.
2835 2018-10-09 19:04:13 Find out what a Day Trader does. Get good at it. You then can retire from your job. It is what banks, oil companies do to make money. We do it & teach it.

2844 2018-10-09 19:03:24 One is not mutually exclusive from the other. There are plenty of investors that own shares in both Tesla and oil companies. One can be bearish about Tesla from a valuation standpoint while still believing in the overall cause of reduced fossil fuel usage.
2845 2018-10-09 19:03:24 I do not see why Russia would join the OPEC group ? I really believe that if oil prices hit $100 and above in November 2018, there are risks for OPEC group to be dismantled.
2846 2018-10-09 19:03:20 Grenada is fire i gotta work my up to that much oil being thrown on me
2847 2018-10-09 19:03:14 I like aveeno moisturizer on my face, any vitamin e oil, rose water, and st Ives scrub! Vitamin E is really good for clearing your skin up, you should definitely get that!
2848 2018-10-09 19:02:56 I take like 3 Excedrin, peppermint oil, and then if I'm at home i tie a long sleeve t-shirt snuggly around my temple  and over my eyes and try to nap it off.

2850 2018-10-09 19:02:49 Actually solidified NG?  (Nitrates for the fertilizer come from NH3 which is made from NG.)  

If so, it's a political play.  The farmers like it because there are more corn sales, and the oil business likes it because a) there are more NG sales and b) more gasoline gets exported
2851 2018-10-09 19:02:46 Vegan baking is literally using coconut oil instead of egg it’s so easy
2852 2018-10-09 19:02:33 How much do you make as an oil lobbyist?
2853 2018-10-09 19:02:25 Trump also wants to reinvest in coal. A greenhouse gas emitter. How backwards is that? We should be focused on renewable energies like wind and sunlight, ocean currents, etc. Oil and coal are dangerous and climate changing.

2859 2018-10-09 19:02:02 @Honda We own a 2017 Honda CR-V EX-L. It has a severe oil dilution issue. The problem has been acknowledged by the dealer. When are you going to fix this? Crappy experience so far with Honda.
2860 2018-10-09 19:02:02 FUCK MY LIFEEEEE i haven’t got an oil change since like the summer so i figured that would’ve been the cause lmao
2861 2018-10-09 19:02:01 “okay you can’t tell me he had anything to do with the decline of the economy. since he has “nothing” to do with oil, when the oil boom goes down whose responsible” You only give him credit when it’s high but not when it starts to decline.
2862 2018-10-09 19:01:51 Why would anyone want to wrap the oil killer to make it look like it fell into a big puddle of oil?
2863 2018-10-09 19:01:50 Finally starting to feel human again and all it took was a hot oil treatment and some creative things.
2864 2018-10-09 19:01:45 You have oily skin? Both products have hyaluronic acid in them so it minimizes oil production. If you have dry skin you should get the Hydro boost that says “extra dry”.
2865 2018-10-09 19:01:44 i’m currently at the gym, i have coconut oil in my hair, i have no money, no way to get home and i have to be up at 7am

2882 2018-10-09 18:59:59 I know you are probably not reading this. Maybe later. So i will refrain from asking you whether it's mayo or oil based potato salad.

That said, you bring a lot to the people who follow you. In this mess that is twitter, which is like a Mad Max movie, on the good days.
2883 2018-10-09 18:59:54 If you don't know that the oil and gas lobby targeted #onpoli swing ridings on Fords behalf.. or that he was just in #abpoli wackin' off Jesus Kenney because most of the nitwits out there in red MAGA baseball hats crawl directly from the tar sands .. well, I can't help you.
2884 2018-10-09 18:59:51 But we know how much oil is in the Tankers !
2885 2018-10-09 18:59:49 Could be in one of those oil barrels sitting around.
2886 2018-10-09 18:59:47 @Hiebozeman Switch to #Keto wasn’t as straightforward for me; I’m a type 1 diabetic. Once I got some MCT oil I was good (took about 5-6 days)

It’s smooth sailing now - no issues
2887 2018-10-09 18:59:32 I mix my shampoo with bicarbonate of soda and activated charcoal to create a scrub and hair mask. I exfoliate then let it sit a bit and wash. Condition and rinse then moisturize with Vicks mixed with castor oil. It grows quick. Thick
2888 2018-10-09 18:59:29 its machine coolant oil making process ,its not a milk.pls dont spread false information.
2889 2018-10-09 18:59:25 well i would take notes but my notebooks are covered in basil and oregano and i think my pens are full of olive oil

2891 2018-10-09 18:59:23 I should have specified first oil change by myself. But also. Too long.
2892 2018-10-09 18:59:14 I’ve just cooked the most delicious piece of venison loin from @JhRedpoll with cauliflower roasted with crushed garlic, cumin and coriander seeds and blanched greens tossed with olive oil and chilli. Absolutely bloody lovely. Cherish your local butcher.

2901 2018-10-09 18:58:09 Yesssss. It's everywhere. It's like the one in Clifton when the oil spill incident happened.
2902 2018-10-09 18:58:08 Damn that hair. She must have been low on oil
2903 2018-10-09 18:58:00 Even if all the OPEC+ taps are open, it will not be enough to replace Iran and Venezuela oil. A 100$+ barrel is not impossible end of November 2018.
2904 2018-10-09 18:57:51 people sometimes forget this great land was pried from hands of the peoples who tended this land for time immemorial, the oil sands workers
2905 2018-10-09 18:57:47 I have to say DL so do I! Your baby looks like she is Cooking on Gas and Kimmeridge Oil!
2906 2018-10-09 18:57:42 I can find it archived, but not on the site. The ad claimed when big oil companies need a friend in Lansing they called her, and here's her full quote from your story: 

"That's not my hand," she said. "They're distorting my record, and now they're distorting my pictures."
2907 2018-10-09 18:57:35 Staying dependent on foreign oil to 'own the libs'.
2908 2018-10-09 18:57:16 Now its over, here's some other news: The price of Brent Crude reached $86 today - the highest it has been since 2014. Add in the fact that production costs have halved in the same period and Scotland's oil is now at its most profitable level since it was over $100 a barrel.

2914 2018-10-09 18:56:31 What's incompetent @MBawumia?
For God sake you've been exposed enough, even expired cooking oil has exposed how hollow reckless you are and you  still shamelessly gagging around calling someone incompetent...

2926 2018-10-09 18:55:19 What is the progression, whale oil, coal, oil, nuclear, wind, solar for tax breaks and govt funds. Been uhm 300 plus years since governments have subsidized this. And no one can get enough money.

2929 2018-10-09 18:55:08 With Venezuela going under 1 million per day and if Iran oil exports are sanctioned, none of the major oil producers will be able to replace Venezuela and Iran oil production. Oil prices above 100$ are not impossible.
2930 2018-10-09 18:55:01 i’m sorry didn’t know a single person could control oil prices, wow you just educated me. actually if you weren’t so close minded and read information other than “how great beto is” you would see that cruz’s economy pushes for more jobs

2932 2018-10-09 18:54:56 The Trump administration and the GasOilPollution party are funded agents of Big Oil, Gas, and Coal. Any meaningful environmental damage-mitigation policy efforts will have to wait until after the election and Dems take back the House.

2934 2018-10-09 18:54:42 I never said they weren't good just not as great as solar on paper. Just that they're vastly* popular * off shore due to land being valuable in some areas over solar. That is the threat. Anywhere one has coasts over the sunny wastelands. That is the threat to US oil hegemony.
2935 2018-10-09 18:54:42 Tonight Trump will be hurting Texas oil industry tonight when he announces is plans to expand E15 gasoline. Any idea what Cruz thinks of this?
2936 2018-10-09 18:54:41 "Praise like oil, for Him I pour it out"
2937 2018-10-09 18:54:34 Bottom line is: regardless of how deurmekaar our own economy is; the global markets are also dilly as hell. Emerging markets struggling, trade wars, oil, bailouts and building to another global crash. Tito is a steady and experienced captain on rough seas...I am delighted.
2938 2018-10-09 18:54:29 At this oil change place and they have this scandalous murder case on tv and I slick asked them to check my tire pressure so I can see what happens

2942 2018-10-09 18:54:15 You left out a few important details.
- Alberta oil is expensive to extract
- Not everyone can process heavy crude
- you don't have ocean access
2943 2018-10-09 18:54:12 Spider burners & oil are a dangerous combination
2944 2018-10-09 18:54:06 1. What if you're not scared.  2. Canada doing all those things _ strangling Alberta oil _ and yet it makes no difference.  China still exists.  Next....
2945 2018-10-09 18:54:00 Our economy was in shambles before buhari a rival our biggest export is oil and that oil was been  sold for 39dollar or lower and before then under gej the oil was being sold for 110 to 115 dollar per barrel.
What would buhari would buhari had don with that kind of economy

2951 2018-10-09 18:53:37 All of those pipelines and oil rigs owned by big banks would suddenly have, like, negative value. I'm not a great economist but that sounds pretty bad
2952 2018-10-09 18:53:30 maybe try stuff to soothe the skin? it could be irritated... try out aloe vera gel or tea tree oil, hopefully it helps that’s all i can think of  if it keeps getting worse please go get it checked up!

Some ideas on how to attack back are below. you could call them:

- ICE mouthpiece
- bought by Big Oil
- boneheaded
- can't see the future
- pedos

$tsla $tslaq
2955 2018-10-09 18:53:08 I think petrol should be expensive... Oil is a finite resource that is extremely useful for a lot of things and we're just burning it up. It's electricity that should be far far cheaper.
2956 2018-10-09 18:53:07 Fall is upon us...bring out the season's flavors, mix them with your eleblend gel and conquer what the cold weather has to offer. 

Cinnamon and nutmeg essential oil are said to help improve blood circulation.
Clove bud oil is said to help ease cough and sinus.#fall
2957 2018-10-09 18:53:06 Keto is BS. Once you're off it, you plump up like no other. Another fad until some other snake oil diet scam pops up. The don't eat garbage and go outside and play diet has worked for me for 40yrs.
2958 2018-10-09 18:53:03 Ever ask yourself, why did you buy a pipeline...what do you think happens when that oil is consumed.

Somehow you have fooled your followers that you can be half pregnant.
2959 2018-10-09 18:53:00 There’s a lawsuit against them bc one of their ingredients is used as a Cockroach pesticide but it’s bc they can’t metabolize the ingredient (which is an essential oil from plants) but humans can.

2964 2018-10-09 18:52:41 The audacity to try and stop a legal fuel when they sell one daily that isn't approved for a single engine. Madness of oil.
2965 2018-10-09 18:52:35 With Jason Kenney takes power - Kenney the poster boy for hatred towards LBGT community & a Racist & Bigot Sadly I think most Albertans will fall for his easy fix simpleton solutions that don't work just like Ontario bought into @fordnation snake oil solutions

2969 2018-10-09 18:52:01 I hope they build them better than the rangers, mine had to have the oil pump, engine and turbo replaced at 124000km
2970 2018-10-09 18:51:59 More likely just snake oil and marketing bullshit.
2971 2018-10-09 18:51:59 Damn slicker than oil that was lol
2972 2018-10-09 18:51:52 when you lobby enough to write your own laws you can do this.  and its not just oil, its a lot of other "influencers"

oh well
2973 2018-10-09 18:51:46 bulls car wash oil change guys boofing around. could have changed two cars oil by bow my self 
2974 2018-10-09 18:51:36 falling Rs is good for the exporters,the PTI government as per stated policy and fluctuation is dollar rate is due to  international factors and high oil prices
2975 2018-10-09 18:51:32 What surprises is the presentation.  For myself, there’d be one big tomato on a plate w/a big ‘ol ball of buffalo mozzarella, some basil and a saucer of baslamic vinegar and olive oil.   slice off hunks, hold tomato between mozarrela and basil lead, dip, eat.

2979 2018-10-09 18:51:14 its because of his MiddleEast and Russian Agreements - Oil plans. the Coal Rhetoric is a BS Campaign point, if possible to revive, only minimally effective, with maximum Enrivonmental Consequence. hes an Idiot with a plan. #DrEvil
2980 2018-10-09 18:51:12 It can’t solve anything if you’re not in it.  So... how much oil stock do you own?
2981 2018-10-09 18:51:10 Producing oil isn’t the current issue, West Texas has a shortage in pipeline capacity to get that oil back to storage.
2982 2018-10-09 18:51:07 Slippery slope you’ll be dipping bread in oil next 
2983 2018-10-09 18:51:05 Knowing Trump attitude, I don't believe he will give a waiver at all. The important point is, if Iran is sanctioned and not able to export its oil, will other western countries accept a barrel >$100 and for how long ? knowing limited OPEC+ countries limitations to produce more.
2984 2018-10-09 18:51:03 Ya girl upgraded her doterra account so if anyone wants to oil w/ me lmk and I can get you started

2990 2018-10-09 18:50:44 Our dog has extreme separation anxiety. He would chew through couches carpet, and walls. If we put him in a kennel, he would slobber like crazy all over himself. So I’ve also heard about the CBD oil, but we took him to the vet, and they gave him anxiety meds that really helped!
2991 2018-10-09 18:50:34 That they do. I've had fish oil rec multiple times in the span of a year for practically all the symptoms of autoimmune disease. And it's frustrating bc I have a science degree and research the research. Sorry to unload, but it resonates feeling the need to tough it out.
2992 2018-10-09 18:50:33 Jesus you’re so close minded. Just because the oil is the highest leading factor to the Economy doesn’t mean everything else around it is going to rise. But I mean that’s his fault too.
2993 2018-10-09 18:50:23 Just use baseline or olive oil. Same thing.

Use coconut oil works for rashes too.
2994 2018-10-09 18:50:17 Knowing Trump attitude, I don't believe he will give a waiver at all.

3001 2018-10-09 18:50:00 The major mistake the us makes with tarifs is that the Price of any commodity they sanction (like aluminium of oil) instantly soars meaning that the party the tarifs are used against instantly gain a minitairy bump even if they lose exports to the us...

3006 2018-10-09 18:49:27 Certain needs for coal & oil, never go away. 

The Point: we cripple 3rd-world from industrializing if we restrict tech old to us, but new to them. So long as they can't grow, they must war. 

That's the inherent philo of Clinton Global Initiative, to gain customers+prevent War.

3013 2018-10-09 18:48:59 Wow!, all your tweets are against Tesla! Do you have a personal problem with the company? Have they hurt you in any way? Or do you have shares on oil companies?
3014 2018-10-09 18:48:55 Reminder @Heritage is a Koch Brothers propaganda outlet whose sole mission is hypocrisy in the name of profit They deserve no legitimacy in the US or elsewhere. #humanrights is better off without their slave, tobacco and oil blood-money.

3017 2018-10-09 18:48:37 It came at a huge cost which seems to continue despite increasing global crude oil prices.
1. Millions of Jobs lost.
2. Increasing inflation.
3. Higher debt profile.

5. Worse of all, the certificateless became lifeless.
3018 2018-10-09 18:48:26 @sajidjavid prescribing oil on nhs is a step forward however cannabis from the streets is being messed with and becoming unsafe for people...this must also be legalised taxed and sold in shops to stop this gettin worse.

3022 2018-10-09 18:47:53 Had an oil change like a month ago need another one already
3023 2018-10-09 18:47:44 Respectfully suggest what’s needed urgently are simple specific understandable instructions please, for example: 1. Stop burning fossil fuels (i.e. gas, oil, petrol, diesel, coal, turf) and 2. Stop eating meat (beef, lamb, mutton, pork, chicken, duck, fish). Thank you. #SDG13
3024 2018-10-09 18:47:28 Im vegetarian & I % agree. This is total diversion/distraction from the real problem: US dependence on oil & the desire for US companies to capitalize on every last drop of the less than 55yr supply, befor being forced to invest in green/renewable energy/electric/hydro cars etc
3025 2018-10-09 18:47:23 I just dropped my car off to get a oil change so I’m walking about 1.5 miles to da bank. Ppl might think I’m broke & ain’t got a car 
3026 2018-10-09 18:47:15 Chef Skinner cut up some chocolate, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was an old shoe brush, along with toast.
3027 2018-10-09 18:47:08 OIL DOES NOT HYDRATE!!!!
3028 2018-10-09 18:47:01 No need. We have plenty of oil money here. Won’t matter.

3031 2018-10-09 18:46:49 Oh I'm fine with small small amounts of hazelnuts.

I'm talking about just having the actual raw nuts themselves.

Maybe it's the oil in them that's causing it.
3032 2018-10-09 18:46:47 We've changed our fries earlier this year, Heidi. Our thick-cut fries are fried in canola oil and served with the skin on, so you’re always reminded that they’re made from 100% Canadian-grown Russet potatoes.
3033 2018-10-09 18:46:45 Is oil a value?
3034 2018-10-09 18:46:45 They briefly touched on the olympics and oil but seems a good 90% was the UCP news from the weekend
3035 2018-10-09 18:46:29 wunderground, the weather channel, the weather company and accuweather are all owned by big oil/coal/media and there front corps and do not cover climate change and global warming, they are all lying by omission by not including the connection to man made climate change,
3036 2018-10-09 18:46:21 That is probably not true. Governments, militaries and oil companies knew exactly what was coming, but were not incentivized to change it.
3037 2018-10-09 18:45:37 I think for soya production to improve, it will take the involvement of the cooking oil manufacturers, an arrangement with farmers we're they get inputs and other forms of support like knowledge on how to get best yeilds etc
3038 2018-10-09 18:45:19 NBFCs are fine but why is paper going down which has nothing to do with oil, inr etc...
3039 2018-10-09 18:45:17 I still don't have a clue why countries like Russia don't EMBRACE renewable energy. They could have a lock on windfarms,  solar and make more cash than with oil. 

I just don't get it.

3048 2018-10-09 18:44:29 Can’t walk in five guys if you have a peanut allergy, they be having peanuts and peanut oil all over the place lmao
3049 2018-10-09 18:44:04 Climate change,  I believe a great start would be to change every diesel Vehicle in the USA over to Natural gas, that third rate crude oil should be against the law to use. There's definitely more to do but that would be a great start to not have to smell diesel fuel fumes.
3050 2018-10-09 18:44:00 the drop off was from the oil bust, wdym
3051 2018-10-09 18:44:00 A Junta Militar que governa o Peru expropriou as jazidas petrolíferas de La Brea e Parinas e ordenou que o Exército ocupasse a refinaria de Talara, os oleodutos e os acampamentos da empresa International Petroleum Corporation, subsidiária da Standard Oil.
3052 2018-10-09 18:43:46 I work in the oil industry, and tbh that headline isn't false, misleading sure... but it really is incredible nobody got killed. You dont usually get that lucky if something in your area or unit explodes.
3053 2018-10-09 18:43:46 There was the resurrection of defunct services such as Medical aid, Insurance and Pension schemes. Basic goods such as cooking oil, sugar, reappeared in supermarkets and fuel was now available. Due to the availability of fuel at filling stations the transport system normalisd
3054 2018-10-09 18:43:45 I mean, I still blame @PhilipAJackson for rejecting my veto during joint session at OIL. #GoodOleDays
3055 2018-10-09 18:43:43 Just wondering how many people get relief from smoking or vaping #CBD compared from taking #CBD oil?
3056 2018-10-09 18:43:30 I found several good DIY lotion/cream recipes. Currently using a shea, mango butter, olive oil combo w/ essential oils stored in a glass apothecary flip-lid jar.

3059 2018-10-09 18:43:17 Keep slapping yourself for not understanding the trickle down affect of tariffs.  Oil is only a small aspect.  Need steel to build drills, pipelines, trucks, parts, etc.  Need computers, circuit boards, sensors and detectors to find it and control its refinement.  #comeonman

3065 2018-10-09 18:42:59 Crude oil prices at roughly $75 will be a headwind to growth as is the current back up in rates.

3083 2018-10-09 18:40:55 I think it’s time to question if it’s too late for a carbon tax model, maybe now that it is the companies will choose that route to avoid what is now/soon needed, banning coal and phasing out oil and gas very quickly.

Terus jg kalo make oil dlu, takutnya yg waterbase ga bisa nembus barrier dr face-oilnya

3101 2018-10-09 18:39:12 Energy production...US oil, natural gas, coal...how they sustain highest quality of living at low prices.  Only coverage is given to "green" energy w/no mention of killing birds & taxpayer subsidies.
3102 2018-10-09 18:39:09 Of course forestry is cropped and regrowth occurs. Can palm oil be included in a crop rotation scheme?
3103 2018-10-09 18:39:06 They bombarded humans, trees, animals and stone. They have not surrounded 28 million people by blocking the entry of food, medicine, aid, oil derivatives, gas, etc. They are collectively exterminated by starvation and death slowly.

3109 2018-10-09 18:38:25 @theindicator I’ve got an economic mystery that needs solving: why does the cost of rock chip repair vary so wildly across the country. My quick survey found prices from $24.95 (UT) to $119 (MD). Similarly simple services like oil changes are much more consistent nationwide.
3110 2018-10-09 18:38:05 i have this oil that i got in a birch box one month and it works like a charm
3111 2018-10-09 18:38:04 Aw, it's ok. I always ask that because one time someone DM'd me that cbd oil gave them a tummy ache, and when she showed me the ingredients all it said was ayurvedic herbs... and I was like gurrrl.... that is not cbd!

3115 2018-10-09 18:37:43 No, you need to understand onions had to sit and wait until cooking oil came to existence, in order for them to reach their full potential. Imagine the years of being useless, to then bringing an evolution to making food..onions are GOATs
3116 2018-10-09 18:37:40 and oil will do really, tho don’t try using vegetable oil don’t think that’ll go down wellx
3117 2018-10-09 18:37:37 Ethanol- Not seeing E15 news as all that supportive and the model seeks an intra-year trend type of peak. Not finding enough evidence to assume a long-term low is in place. And now crude oil is due to peak. #ethanol

3138 2018-10-09 18:35:31 Yeah, because of poor decisions by the Chávez/Madurai government in part—particularly the over-dependence on oil. But that crisis was then exploited by the right via , US-lead financial sanctions, and corporate sabotage. The exact same forces at work behind Bolsonaro.

3169 2018-10-09 18:33:01 Think of 2 curves on a graph, graphed according to usage & price.

1st is oil curve; ideally it will intersect the 2nd (solar etc) curve, so that 2nd gradually replaces 1st.

Certain uses can never convert. We really need nuclear.

3185 2018-10-09 18:31:44 At one time maybe? I think now it's more like our provincial ownership of the resource and private companies do the extraction for royalties. Since their oil is offshore, there are no pesky private landowners to deal with.
3186 2018-10-09 18:31:43 This reminds me of a campaign mailer House Democrats sent out against then-Rep. Leslie Mortimer in 2006 that super-imposed another woman's hand into a photo to portray her on a red phone with a J.R. Ewing-like oil man. It had to do with her no vote on taxing low-yield oil wells.

3221 2018-10-09 18:28:34 "What are you gonna do on your day off? Go to the beach? Have a me day?"

Shit, never mind...brakes need work apparently..SO CLOSE!!!!

3230 2018-10-09 18:27:56 Ohh ook. Yea a lot of the times the wax is too harsh for the skin on our faces. If you do ever wanna do something to them again, try threading. Put some tea tree oil and witch hazel on your eyebrows. Be careful tea tree oil is strong + can make your eyes water if you use too much
3231 2018-10-09 18:27:47 Still waiting for oil to run out. 20 years ago they predicted we'd be out of oil today.
3232 2018-10-09 18:27:47 You can’t tell me he had ANYTHING to do with the boost in the oil industry.
3233 2018-10-09 18:27:40 It is the breakfast and peanut oil
3234 2018-10-09 18:27:39 It’ll happen. Lay money on it. It’s not a presidency- it’s part cult , part cartel and all snake oil.
3235 2018-10-09 18:27:38 @CPC Doug Ford and Jason Kenney are pandering to the oil and gas lobby. All are a threat to both Canadian democracy and the environment. #cdnpoli

3239 2018-10-09 18:27:12 TRUMP THINKS CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX .....JUST LIKE THE OIL COMPANIES TOLD HIM TO THINK
3240 2018-10-09 18:27:12 Until the day we dont need their money or oil we will be complaisant on how they Treat minorities. The left are afraid to say anything in lieu of being called a racist and the right like the money and oil.
3241 2018-10-09 18:27:03 Why u com dey complain before? Besides glowing has nothing to do with ur complexion. Both fair and dark shades can be dull but exfoliating with the right product can make ur complexion pop especially when u add a natural glow oil
3242 2018-10-09 18:26:58 Energy XLE is the top ranked SPDR Sector. Basic Materials XLB in last place and sinking because of higher oil prices and low Chinese demand. China seems to be tumbling and may be in worse shape than they let on.
3243 2018-10-09 18:26:54 Create MORE CO2 - carbon dioxide, the colourless, odourless essential gass for life on planet Earth. #ClimateChange #GlobalWarming is a hoax designed by Oil Corporations & #Banksters to screw u for even more of ur hard-earned dosh - Earth is COOLING NOT WARMING!
3244 2018-10-09 18:26:51 Didn't Putin ask Trump to look himself in the mirror on why oil price was up? It is Iran sanction stupid.
3245 2018-10-09 18:26:25 And isn’t their oil industry nationalized or something approximating it?
3246 2018-10-09 18:26:17 I have this little sample setting spray I got from Sephora that helped control my oil. I’ll try to remember to look at the brand when I get off work. But honestly I just make sure I have paper towel to blot and a powder in my bag
3247 2018-10-09 18:26:09 @morningmika yesterday we learned that global warming is coming for us ; let trump tell us about Oil and coil! Dumb people with dumb policies! These people who vote for him will will the first one affected
3248 2018-10-09 18:26:06 What about doing away with the 12 year "deadline," and using gas and oil subsidies to fund those expensive carbon capture technologies?
3249 2018-10-09 18:26:05 You know you can cut out dairy AND palm oil....
3250 2018-10-09 18:26:04 2. short-sellers sponsored media attacks, 3. oil people sponsored media attacks 4. petro-state sponsored media attacks, 5. ICE automakers sponsored media attacks, and 6.. just the green-eyed monsters/haters attack
3251 2018-10-09 18:26:04 @PalmersUK I need your help! I can't seem to get your facial cleansing oil anywhere and basically I can't cope without it! It is the only thing that removes all traces of my makeup and leaves my skin looking amazing! #pleasehelp #skinsos #ilovepalmers

3255 2018-10-09 18:25:40 Exxon certainly knew, and we give big oil $4b in direct subsidies per year, if that was New Starts it would 3x program size. Similarly, I'd like to see how much HNTB got paid for Opportunity Corridor. And then we need to have auto bailouts because we rigged the whole thing.
3256 2018-10-09 18:25:39 no end...but a very clear purpose...steal oil...
3257 2018-10-09 18:25:37 You get oil for head!
3258 2018-10-09 18:25:31 Nope, oil companies need to stop drilling the oil and gas full stop. If they are that keen maybe they should fund the great green wall too @Shell
3259 2018-10-09 18:25:28 It's God's will that there's war, destruction and destabilisation over oil and gas, regardless of the fact that three groups all worship the same God, because either the devotees are brainwashed or their God's a murderous, bloodthirsty dick.
3260 2018-10-09 18:25:25 Pfft, you should see my face when I haven't washed it for a few hours, it's like a massive oil spill 
3261 2018-10-09 18:25:20 Have you ever wondered why the Irish republic, who don't supply 43% of Britain's oil or 45% of Britain's gas has a GDP that blows Scotland's out the fecking water? Oh stay in the UK your doing great Scotland
3262 2018-10-09 18:25:16 Give me all the pasta, bread, olive oil, pizza and wine. Carbs don’t count in Italy.
3263 2018-10-09 18:25:15 Haha well he has done the most research on the economics of oil in the province. He also made some bad predictions about the price of oil but to be fair, predicting oil prices is about as easy as predicting who will win the Stanley Cup next year (tho gr8r risk if yr wrong)
3264 2018-10-09 18:25:09 Best way is to import oil by issuing Oil Bonds. Queres que te faça um desenho? 
3265 2018-10-09 18:24:47 My first reaction? IMPOSSIBLE.
Saudi Arabia should do the following: but will the king listen to me?
1) Call Opec emergency meeting and HIKE UP the oil prices
2) cut off oil supplies to any country whose press has made these allegations.
3) demand proof
4) demand compensation

Still pensioners were dying
You will not forgiven for that!

@APCNigeria @MBuhari
 released funds for the pensioners after 3 years in office

@MBuhari
 till 2023
The die is cast
3273 2018-10-09 18:23:44 Which is why we need economic incentives to increase R&D of alternatives.  Oil demand will reduce if alternatives are available and real cost of hydrocarbons is in place.  Oil is a false economy - we will have to pay today or tomorrow.

3280 2018-10-09 18:22:58 3 fucking hours for an oil change? Good grief
3281 2018-10-09 18:22:56 Know very little about this but wasnt there a recent massive trial on fish oil supplements that shows no benefit. Would they really have missed this aspect ?
3282 2018-10-09 18:22:38 We have oil, so it's a case of shop around before you order
3283 2018-10-09 18:22:32 I've ordered some oil to try but might look into vaping if the oil doesn't help
3284 2018-10-09 18:22:30 I wonder what the overlap of Oil Sands workers and racist, homophobic and islamophobia is?
3285 2018-10-09 18:22:30 Like what's deep is, who discovered that this shit goes so well with cooking oil.
3286 2018-10-09 18:22:27 @realDonaldTrump. Mr. President sir. Just a thought how about you or the government start a new news station so we all really know what's new and all true
 That would be great. Also are you going to get the oil prices to come back to about 2.00 a gallon again. Its really hurting
3287 2018-10-09 18:22:25 Super! :) After my fair trade coffee today I'm going to suck back some fair trade oil to slide things along. Total bliss :)

3294 2018-10-09 18:21:00 Canada's Conservative Parties not only are pandering to the oil and gas lobby; they are a threat to both Canadian democracy and environment.
3295 2018-10-09 18:20:54 Cleanest most ethical oil. Facts? Examples? Why is the author making that statement? Is the author referring to extraction only? Are they including remediation in that as well? Byproducts? Is the author a stakeholder in the oilsands if so are they being objective?
3296 2018-10-09 18:20:53 The only thing kids should take from this crap is to beware of snake oil salesmen
3297 2018-10-09 18:20:50 i paid $73 for an oil change yesterday. wtf?
3298 2018-10-09 18:20:32 the point source of emissions is distributed, but the corporate mix of oil, auto, highway engineering firms surely make concentrated profits from the sector
3299 2018-10-09 18:20:16 AM: 2 cups of Gain 20 (spec greyhound food) soaked in hot water to soften it, with a spoon of coconut oil mixed in for his skin/coat. Slice of brown toast with pate.

3300 2018-10-09 18:20:16 They have small, homogeneous populations, high taxes, almost no immigration and massive oil royalties.  There’s no comparison between them and NA, door.
3301 2018-10-09 18:20:14 They're all doing major e initiatives, and some minor alternatives like H. We've been about to run out of oil since 1960, yet here we are.
3302 2018-10-09 18:20:13 I never want to have a wreck but I think I’d be madder if I just got an oil change, washed my car, or just filled up my tank with gas
3303 2018-10-09 18:20:12 I remember Japan attacked us b/c we put an oil embargo upon them for invading China, alongside other financial sanctions which proves Paul's blowback idea and warning regarding alliances. If we had not picked sides with China and stayed in our own lane, maybe that gets avoided.
3304 2018-10-09 18:20:08 We ignored USA on Russian arms and Iranian oil. We rejected Australia from Malabar exercises. PM Modi went to Wuhan to make peace with China. PM Modi never spoke against China at Shangri La summit against US wishes. We always maintained the quad is not a grouping against China.

3306 2018-10-09 18:19:57 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

3310 2018-10-09 18:19:48 A river of motor oil crashing down the highway, fusing merging drivers and vehicles into massive car-beasts, ejecting their passengers into the slurry to become glistening motorcycle-creatures.
3311 2018-10-09 18:19:47 Exactly. My point that in the context of record high oil production at the very healthy oil price, why raise the VAT which will hit economic growth at the time when they're struggling to get that growth going in the first place. Surely, wiser to spend oil revenues not raise taxes
3312 2018-10-09 18:19:38 What, no oil?
3313 2018-10-09 18:19:36 I fucked up and didn’t charge up my phone before this oil change

3318 2018-10-09 18:19:11 Vegan Protein Balls: take some nuts and dried fruit and add it to a blender with maple Sirup, a spoon full spirulina, a spoon of coconut oil and whizz it up to a dough. Then I form balls and roll them in Coconut shreds:)
3319 2018-10-09 18:19:08 Kerala CPM has same plan for its Finances as Imran Khan's Pakistan - take a begging bowl and beg from the oil sheikhs and rich expats. That's what Communism does to its people -- violence towards opponents at home and (when need arises) beg for some $$$ from outsiders. 

Yuck!
3320 2018-10-09 18:19:06 It was Heath. Oil lamps and a 'Superser' gas heater. There was, apparently enough coal! But the Tories thought they could get away with lying, so no change there then.

3341 2018-10-09 18:16:06 Ewww y’all nasty  I cannot. Is oil and gas on there every time or is it just an essay possibility?
3342 2018-10-09 18:16:02 @LBC @IainDale  the SNP white paper wasn't worth the paper it was written on & Scotland would have been bankrupt within a year. They based oil estimates at 9 billion when in fact it was in negative figures. And I had no plan for a currency!

-Oil drilling off VA Beach
-Reduce SocSec & Medicare funding
-ZERO oversight on corruption
3344 2018-10-09 18:16:01 Eh, not really. At best that's an oversimplification. It's just aggregating downstream usage.
You fly on Delta.
Delta buys gas from refinery.
Refinery buys oil from Exxon.
This counts the gas from your flight against Exxon.

3348 2018-10-09 18:15:26 The US is not the only producer of goods and services. China has already sought other sellers to obtain their oil, just for starters. Also the Chinese govt. can pursue geopolitical aims without as much regard as to the effect on their citizens as the US.

3357 2018-10-09 18:14:56 I hope so too but of course it’s all about the money and keeping the 1% rich and keeping all the oil cartels in business

3363 2018-10-09 18:14:17 Yes that may be it. 
Also I'm uncomfortable with the word 'expert' when used in this context. Wasn't he touting $150 oil for the next 50 years
3364 2018-10-09 18:14:06 It's nothing to do with the ingredients, it's how the oil vats are filtered
3365 2018-10-09 18:14:06 Having oil doesn't just solve it, having a good leadership for the management of the oil resources is what makes a great nation
3366 2018-10-09 18:14:04 And what is ironic, the referendum favors biomass, which causes CO2 and produces a tiny amount of power, over nuclear, because it is "renewable."

IPCC hates nuclear too

They're still using persuasion reminants of peak oil and conflating it with global warming in this battle.
3367 2018-10-09 18:13:58 He doesn’t want his constituents to know the truth. As long as he keeps giving his 1% ers their tax breaks, they don’t care what he does. Of course if he devalues their beautiful beachfront property with oil sludge and derricks, they might go batshit crazy

3370 2018-10-09 18:13:42 U.S. Gulf of Mexico producers have cut about 40 percent of oil production due to #HurricaneMichael
3371 2018-10-09 18:13:24 38yo me's idea of exciting day:
Get my oil changed (at least 1 hour of uninterrupted reading!)
Shopping at Value Village (3 shirts my wife will let me wear in public, 1 she'll be less enthusiastic for)
Leftover brat with mango salsa
And it's only 2pm!

3380 2018-10-09 18:12:57 Just took a oregano oil, wheat grass, and ginger shot....
3381 2018-10-09 18:12:55 Government has decreased sales tax on oil. Please read the news carefully. International market prices rose but government decreased tax to avoid burden on masses.
3382 2018-10-09 18:12:51 はい…すみませんでした…
3383 2018-10-09 18:12:50 everything was coming together for emily, a struggling oil rig worker in moscow. of course, a younger man changed their life forever. soundtrack by the korean girlgroup red velvet. featuring vladmir putin and elon musk.
3384 2018-10-09 18:12:38 You forget.  The repair issue is the result of incompetent and sinister third-party body and repair shops.  Obviously, they're also in the pocket of big oil and Chanos.
3385 2018-10-09 18:12:36 Ooh I love that idea? They’ll get soft fluffy pillows and oil baths. Some owners even get them jewels to wear and them polished every day.

3388 2018-10-09 18:11:56 Good initiative. Why dont they give you ARDA farms. You do soya while other guys do wheat. Will solve bread and cooking oil challenges.
3389 2018-10-09 18:11:55 Nope working  in the mailroom at an oil company.
3390 2018-10-09 18:11:47 How you can stop climate change:
Eat less meat, go by bike instead of cars and buy products with less packaging while petrol companies squeeze out and sell every last drop of oil this planet has to offer
3391 2018-10-09 18:11:47 Praised be God.
3392 2018-10-09 18:11:41 it has a TON of other effects on our world and all the animals on it. also, what about plastic pollution, oil spills, chemicals in our water/air, etc. etc. etc.? none of that is natural. this topic has always been something important to me, so if i sound aggressive thats why

3400 2018-10-09 18:10:47 speculation///Noun///ˌspɛkjəˈleɪʃən///a guess or idea about something that is not certain///A large amount of speculation in the market has pushed up oil prices.

#TOEIC
3401 2018-10-09 18:10:47 And while some growth in renewables is happening. It's not even keeping up with overall demand increase.  Oil demand continues its inexorable growth at 1.5 mmbpd/yr.
3402 2018-10-09 18:10:35 Nothing personal-As an “Economist”he should have done his homework. Oil was beginning to tank and Quebec couldn’t sell its excess power... My takeaway from him... “..there will always be opponents... first lesson Wade, don’t invest your money unless you can afford to lose it all”
3403 2018-10-09 18:10:22 Royal Saudi pigs maintain one of the world’s most vile and corrupt medieval states. Women of all ages are legally treated like children, the royal family privately owns the nation’s oil wealth, foreign workers are treated like slaves, citizens are oppressed and given no rights.
3404 2018-10-09 18:10:21 70’s Inflation over 25%. Due to oil prices tripling & rising wages forced by powerful Unions. Employers wages bill up, lead to increase product prices/ cost of living causing a wage-inflationary spiral and leading to 3 day weeks and hard times I remember.

3408 2018-10-09 18:10:10 how about cutting the greenhouse gas from coal\oil\natural gas 
seems like that's a bigger source by far
3409 2018-10-09 18:10:07 It just made me hungry. I want some palm oil stew, casava, and turnip greens.  and every rice dish all my ppl make.

3411 2018-10-09 18:09:56 Not sure  I would look at the airplane as an app and the oil a different type of technology that created the need for the platform/infraestructure that is airports. You have a set limit of planes without the platform, the platform allows for exponential coordination.

3413 2018-10-09 18:09:39 No, no no! He doesn't trust science not because he doesn't understand it, but because he believes there is more profit to be had in coal and oil. It's always about money! Don't underestimate his capacity for greed.
3414 2018-10-09 18:09:37 well I have a crappy phone.

3418 2018-10-09 18:09:20 My MacBook Pro has oil paint and charcoal all over it. This makes my techie husband very sad. #artistlife #ThisIsWhyWeCantHaveNiceThings #MacBookPro
3419 2018-10-09 18:09:15 America is a fucking joke. Y'all wanna sue @lacroixwater but let's talk about antibiotics in chicken, e-coli in red meat, palm oil and how y'all fucking the environment but y'all wanna sue a fucking seltzer. All jokes. Imma keep drinking my tasty ass seltzer.
3420 2018-10-09 18:09:04 We always hear about being prepared for hurricanes, well I think our state and federal governments should do a better job with fuel supply.
   The president could use the strategic oil supply to avoid price spikes. States could develop storage and supply roots to avoid spikes.
3421 2018-10-09 18:09:02 He literally couldn’t, khabib had his ankle and then his thigh. Conor was only safe when he was oil checking khabib and then transitioned to grabbing his shorts

3426 2018-10-09 18:08:28 Oil change thanks to bay 
3427 2018-10-09 18:08:24 How much in taxes can you afford? 65%? 75%? Add in increased property tax if Prop 112 passes and we lose $250M a year in oil royalties going to schools. Schools need that $! Oh, plus increase power bill as #Polis wants 100% renewable energy! R U broke yet? #COpolitics #COgov
3428 2018-10-09 18:08:18 always the correct answer!! I'm not well adept in talking oil industry. it seems if they increase capex, they're potentially tapping more resources knocking the price of oil down. perhaps use this cash and beat elon at making a better battery. I dont know.
3429 2018-10-09 18:08:12 if it's unopened it might still be ok! i have.... so many things. i particularly liked their rose hip oil for complexion repair, and their granactive retinol is lovely too
3430 2018-10-09 18:07:58 Kombis have a right to charge $1. Fuel is their only cost that is manageable at present 

1) oil
2) tyres
3) shocks
4) filters, spark plugs, kits etc

These are just some items that need replacing at regular intervals that exclude fuel. They purchase these in USD in most cases!!!
3431 2018-10-09 18:07:55 Ohhh no, the oil industry will make that very difficult in North Dakota. Try Wyoming, just to start.

3439 2018-10-09 18:06:12 More pressure on the Palm oil culprits... Wilmar , PepsiCo , Colgate , Ben & Jerrys, Nestle etc.. It has to stop before it's too late. Is there any way to hold talks with the CEO's of these companies ??
3440 2018-10-09 18:06:11 Are you going to explain your endorsement of a Rain Tax or how you wanted to tax each barrel of oil $10 which in turn would be 24¢ a gallon at the pump?
3441 2018-10-09 18:05:55 Had bay rum beard oil applied & the smell was majestic as the warming rays of sun brought out the fragrance 
3442 2018-10-09 18:05:32 An that's why Nato want to be there.
Nothing picks up western goverment ears than that of oil.
3443 2018-10-09 18:05:30 It's because the  Aussie dollar is falling and the price of oil in US dollars is rising. A double whammy.
3444 2018-10-09 18:05:25 One was in charge of oil for two years and never owned a gas station. The other left Customs as a Deputy Director and became a part owner of Nigeria @atiku @APCUKingdom

3449 2018-10-09 18:04:53 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on it's board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada.
3450 2018-10-09 18:04:53 I have spina bifida and hydrocephalus. It causes chronic pain and the oil I use works for me. I’m aware that it doesn’t work for everyone, I’m really not saying it does, and I believe that people should have access to the medications that they need
3451 2018-10-09 18:04:50 Those of us in Canada’s oil & gas industry know the feeling
3452 2018-10-09 18:04:50 Always check the oil atleast once per month or once per 2 weeks, almost all my non-car enthausiastic friends almost run dry because of the lack of maintanance. One of them got a siezed engine just because they are too lazy to check :/
3453 2018-10-09 18:04:34 Oil prices are too high. Mr. President please tap the strategic oil reserves and reduce sanctions on Iran. I believe this is necessary to avoid a global recession. American consumers are getting hurt.
3454 2018-10-09 18:04:30 Shea moisture, they balm, detangler and oil
3455 2018-10-09 18:04:06 They fail to understand simple economic tools. They complain abt fuel prices, when they know the mkt price of crude oil on world market, they complain abt cedi rising forgetting factors dat affect exchange rate. There’s employment, restored allowances and all. Ghana will work.
3456 2018-10-09 18:04:03 Tptb probably considers olive oil a part of the nostalgia for the 100th episode since it started on his show and he was his “mentor”.. But they can keep him, he’s interfered enough 
3457 2018-10-09 18:04:02 Trying to figure out what is causing my Clio to burn oil excessively. No oil leak anywhere. The EML goes off when I top the oil up.
3458 2018-10-09 18:03:57 Ouais c’est vrai ça par contre 
3459 2018-10-09 18:03:56 You mean...Honey and Olive oil :D

3462 2018-10-09 18:03:09 Yes sir and if it plays out in that manner, a big advantage goes to the Yankees.
3463 2018-10-09 18:03:06 "Certified" by whom? Certified to be what? Can't you use something else, not palm oil? The certification process is so corrupted that it doesn't mean anything at the moment, I'm afraid.
3464 2018-10-09 18:03:01 It could be climate change is real. It could be climate change is a cover for peak oil. Either way we’re in trouble.
3465 2018-10-09 18:02:55 I’ve heard those oil pens are the way a lot of people have done it. I’m just nervous about getting the black paint on the red outsole.
3466 2018-10-09 18:02:54 Vermin. The sooner we get away from oil the sooner they go back to their tents and caves.
3467 2018-10-09 18:02:53 Oil prices are simply too high. Please tap the strategic oil reserves and remove sanctions on Iran so we do not slide into a recession!
3468 2018-10-09 18:02:50 Afghanistan k liye land route chahiye? Turkmanistan see gas chahiye? Arab see oil chahiye?

3469 2018-10-09 18:02:46 This is way we need to keep our oil flowing to do that we need to vote Republican in November across the board
3470 2018-10-09 18:02:44 I know right? And every time an oil guy *koff W koff* gets into office, those gas prices go right up... but now they fluctuate by 15-20cents too.

We spend money fixing the climate + stuff oilmen's pockets at the same time. They'll just have to do without the new yacht for

3480 2018-10-09 18:01:29 Also PALM OIL is deforesting rain forests as well as child slavery
workers extracting oil and killing the trees for pulp.
DO NOT BUY ANY PRODUCT CONTAINING PALM OIL....
3481 2018-10-09 18:01:28 Wade is also the leading expert in NL on oil & I'm p sure helped draft our present oil royalty regime (he at least heavily endorses it) so it could be related to that?
3482 2018-10-09 18:01:26 To our neighbors of @ChandaranaSuper Lavington, your discharging of waste oil into the sewer line has caused us untold misery with sewer flowing back into our bathrooms due to blockage. As neighbors we find this totally unacceptable. @NemaKenya, will you come to our rescue pse?
3483 2018-10-09 18:01:24 there will always be those who can benefit from destructive industries such as oil & animal agriculture and they have the power & people will always find a reason why they can’t go vegan. atm I am extremely sceptical that people will ever change humanity is fkn doomed

3488 2018-10-09 18:01:02 Incorrect. What I am against is the deception and financial exploitation of women. By snake oil salesmen, fraudsters, and charlatans. 

Buying into bullshit isn't empowerment.
3489 2018-10-09 18:00:59 Not sure exactly what stats you are looking for, but USA accounts for 3-4% of global palm oil imports annually. This year we are expected to import 1.6 million tonnes, slightly down from last year's record 1.64 million.
3490 2018-10-09 18:00:56 Okay guys I finally got my oil changed plz stop sending me oil change memes
3491 2018-10-09 18:00:52 Yet I’m the one asking for that... and you’re posting 2016 memes trust me, I’m not afraid of the intelligence of literally any trump supporter. Like watching people shovel their money to Madoff. Their ancestors bought up all the snake oil in the old west! 
3492 2018-10-09 18:00:49 My grandparents have shitty pans and oil literally does nothing but make it stick to it more

3497 2018-10-09 18:00:24 Tip 2-  
● Check the weather report before applying fertilizer to your lawn or any oil or chemicals to driveways and sidewalks. This will protect the environment and your pocketbook.

3502 2018-10-09 18:00:04 @AshcraftGerel Is a monopoly of oil, hospital, insurance, and law firms, against the US Federal Law,, even if disguised by a series and maze of 'shell' corporations? If so, are the partners of a law firm, and the rest, such as yours, held financially liable?

3505 2018-10-09 18:00:01 Why does no one in the GOP take this seriously? Are they so beholden to the oil & gas lobbies that they’ll dismiss EVERY warning—or do they just not care?

I want a better cleaner world for my children and everyone’s children.  And that includes the Republicans who hate us!
3506 2018-10-09 17:59:52 @TippingTheOdds Tell us whether your study compared corn oil to extra virgin coconut oil or whether the coconut oil was refined dyed and bleached (RDB) removing its nutritional value.
3507 2018-10-09 17:59:46 What's driving oil prices higher?

 A pesky little tweet

3508 2018-10-09 17:59:42 Sir, that is due to rising us yield. India's wpi basket is still low, only oil cost is rising. Increasing interest rate hampers economic activity. Main function of monetary policy is to check inflation not exchange rate

3512 2018-10-09 17:59:15 Who on here uses CBD oil?  What brand do you use? Is it made from the hemp plant or hemp seed? Is it 100% CBD oil or does it use additives like glycerin???? Do you get it from a local store or order online? What is your experience with it? I'm curious. :)
3513 2018-10-09 17:59:08 Trade deficit is mainly contributed by China 31bn $ (31% of total) due to FTA & heavy materials n machinery imports for #CPEC.Other drains r due 2 Saudia &UAE (together 33% of deficit) caused by crude oil.Only singapore trade gave us 4%surplus which our govt should focus 2 boost
3514 2018-10-09 17:59:05 MSNBC covers climate change? If so I apologize but I thought their top Advertisers included Big Oil.

3517 2018-10-09 17:58:35 Is it a drink? Sachet? I'm confused but that's not unusual!! I'm trying to create my own label/brand of Alaskan Lilac Lotion. Lilac is not an essential oil, can't be. Very very few 'out there' & the good kind? $$$$$$ to sell, but $ to make!
3518 2018-10-09 17:58:22 So how many oil blocks are you currently enjoying 
3519 2018-10-09 17:58:18 Makufunga cooking oil yamiitisa #chigumbachallange lol
3520 2018-10-09 17:58:16 Overall I'd say they are same in the sense that you're going under the ground to bring out a resource, but Drilling Eng is oil/gas, and Mining is prob other things
3521 2018-10-09 17:58:13 I have truly terrible news for you about the oil industry in Texas.
3522 2018-10-09 17:58:13 I need the hair growth oil,  how do i get it?
3523 2018-10-09 17:58:11 When I had my fro I would co-wash, deep condition and then use coconut oil to do as many bantu knots as possible to stretch out my hair using 3-way twists, and then leave my hair sealed like that for atleast two days before braiding
3524 2018-10-09 17:58:05 Dear sir what do you think is the motive behind such a move ? I also heard that the oil minister was appointed as the GD of the national oil company.
3525 2018-10-09 17:58:03 Lol mane we going to have oil and shit for you . I need u lit lit and also yeah I got to help you with your captions 
3526 2018-10-09 17:58:02 The winter bike just can't be ignored is all.  Give it a wash from time to time, soak the chain in oil, and definitely give it a once over at the end of the season.  Chains, cassettes, shifter cables etc are cheap ish, and likely less than a tank of gas for most.
3527 2018-10-09 17:57:57 Listen to your science advisers. Listen to the UN. Global warming is real and will result in more hurricanes and coastal flooding. Get rid of coal, oil, wood, gas and switch over to renewables.

3530 2018-10-09 17:57:25 Hmmm...renewables, farming, fishing, water, gas, whisky, gin, oil, tourism etc etc. I'm well aware of the resources we are lucky enough to have, thanks

3535 2018-10-09 17:57:00 Back in Irvine for a bit to get my oil changed. Tv has an ad for @katieporteroc which is what I’ve been saying about @MimiWaltersCA for months, she stands with Trump 99% of the time. Wish I still lived here to cast my vote for Katie. #VoteKatiePorter

3538 2018-10-09 17:56:07 The US is not respected around the world anymore.  The Trump bots, like Haley, just spout & spirt party oil while breaking down in confusion.  She broke down long ago & still maybe a candidate for the NYT anonymous op-ed author.

3541 2018-10-09 17:55:54 Get some olive oil and some fresh crushed pepper to put in that oil, possibly some garlic too.

3547 2018-10-09 17:55:17 Oil & Gas billionaires, and millonaire property owners on the front range, want to be able to get welfare from the government and use MY TAX DOLLARS to cover losses from their operations. Not surprised, just disappointed.

3553 2018-10-09 17:54:24 What's wrong with us as individuals taking responsibility for our part in this problem? We've all enjoyed the benefits of consumerism, so blaming this all on governments & big oil (or CNN) misses the point.  They didn't even ask us to stop driving so much!
3554 2018-10-09 17:54:21 Based on the latest estimates, Alberta has the largest recoverable oil reserves in the world. If we had ocean access, we could eliminate all personal income taxes from the proceeds. Why do we hurt ourselves by blocking pipelines?

3555 2018-10-09 17:54:14 Then came the GOLD and after that the OIL,
3556 2018-10-09 17:54:05 you mean is a mrs. Moncherini plan? So the Mullahs flirting continues, will EU be  oil flooded ?
3557 2018-10-09 17:53:56 えっ！？
3558 2018-10-09 17:53:50 Lack of oversight can cause problems too. Remember Standard Oil? Or how AT&T used to be in the distant past? Hell, there's monopolies today with Google and Amazon. They've had no oversight, and there's problems because of that. Like, the claim that Google is censoring.
3559 2018-10-09 17:53:27 Let the PTI leaders approach Iran, China & Russia to support in terms of Natural Gas, Oil & Rail road. Let them invest in Pakistan to build various industries to build this country and to give maximum jobs to the people as committed by PTI.
Stop the PTI leaders to come on TV.
3560 2018-10-09 17:53:27 It's not just solar. It's just if you make someone dependable on oil which will run out it can be worse for them in the future. Atleast you can build up on solar.
3561 2018-10-09 17:53:24 My physio held my knees against his crotch, I made sex noises when he cracked my back and then he rubbed my back with oil. The closest thing I’ve had to ‘action’ in a while...

3583 2018-10-09 17:51:26 It’s super lean like deer. I just add a bit of oil or fat to cook well. We made taco soup, chili, tacos, burgers, and meatloaf with elk. We like it better than cow
3584 2018-10-09 17:51:20 You for building more nuclear power plants so we can shut down coal, oil and gas-fired plants?

3589 2018-10-09 17:50:31 North Carolina lost a lot of opportunities due to the gop’s policies over the last years. They now have a Democrat Governor. Georgia is fueled by the Big Blue city of Atlanta and Texas has oil - and some of the worst income inequality in the US.

3593 2018-10-09 17:49:48 For all the youngsters getting excited about $OIH and $XLE:  The last five economic recessions all were preceded by a spike in crude oil prices.  It's akin to getting excited about interest rates going up.  For most companies (and people) that would be an increase in costs.
3594 2018-10-09 17:49:47 We need to end big oil subsidies!
3595 2018-10-09 17:49:46 I think I might need a beginner crash course to using oil lol

3603 2018-10-09 17:48:49 La Justicia reconoció en una sentencia que OIL le debe a la AFIP $ 1500 millones por la deuda posconcursal  en la quiebra de la empresa. Además, la AFIP sigue exigiendo el cobro de unos $ 8000 millones correspondientes al concurso de la misma empresa por la apropiación del ITC
3604 2018-10-09 17:48:48 My knees are so bothersome I have actually bought a pot of cod liver oil and glucosamine capsules. (A GP told me a while ago that there is *some* merit in them, though they don't work for everyone. Possibly remembering to actually swallow the things may make the difference.)

3608 2018-10-09 17:48:21 I feel like I’m mean to the people who change my oil, but really I just want them to skip the part where they offer me $300 worth of extra stuff I don’t need and just change my oil. 
3609 2018-10-09 17:48:17 Smh. No amount of Sun Tan Oil will protect them from that burn, sir!!!

3617 2018-10-09 17:47:30 My aunt, who one time snitched on me for weed: “Have you heard of cbd oil?”
3618 2018-10-09 17:47:18 I got oil in cylinder 3 and the spark plug casing disintegrated into the well. I'm guessing that my piston rings are going bad which caused the leak in the first place. I'm just burning tons of $$$ fixing broken stuff that isn't routine maintenance.
3619 2018-10-09 17:47:16 Did they serve Oil of Angels?
3620 2018-10-09 17:47:13 Would be so great if they'd blow up all the oil stuff in Linden. Remember the stench every time I had to drive to Newark airport....
3621 2018-10-09 17:47:08 *Remember Venezuela...We are in a dire situation we need support! for years Venezuela has provided with low cost Oil and Sub Products, now we face annihilation from the corrupt Narco Regime of Maduro,we need Intervention, Things are getting out of hands down here! @GOPChairwoman
3622 2018-10-09 17:47:07 China cut US imports dramatically and imported NO oil from the US this month...
3623 2018-10-09 17:47:04 Since this administration started it's just been like  this. No single drop of oil has been cleaned in Ogoni till date... Mr Integrity.
3624 2018-10-09 17:46:57 But also the biggest reason for the economy turnaround is oil went up in price again.
3625 2018-10-09 17:46:54 Then how to make #oil price goes down? Haha
3626 2018-10-09 17:46:54 Now that’s BS. Here in Colorado, the effective tax rate for oil and gas is .6%. (CO Legislative Council [govt] report)
You don’t think everday, impacted residents are smart enough to figure your industry out? You underestimate us at your peril.
3627 2018-10-09 17:46:53 So, why aren’t their oil rich Arab neighbors not helping them out?
3628 2018-10-09 17:46:50 Even if you don't believe in climate change, the two options are "we will all die" and "we might make a little less money in coal and oil", and the people in charge are scared as fuck about the latter because they'll all (thankfully) be dead in a decade.
3629 2018-10-09 17:46:50 How much yall pay for a full synthetic oil change? 
3630 2018-10-09 17:46:45 U deserved to be given an oil well as compensation for u savage response..
3631 2018-10-09 17:46:35 Her only goal is oil
3632 2018-10-09 17:46:33 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, however the open border policies of this Administration.

3644 2018-10-09 17:45:30 If I can refresh your memory, the late UN boss’s son from West Africa was profiteering when his dad was the head of UN in Iraq oil for food program. So many other examples
3645 2018-10-09 17:45:24 This is a really important issue and we’ve been driving industry-wide change for more than 15 years. We’re on track to meet our goal of sourcing 100% physically certified palm oil by the end of 2019.

3676 2018-10-09 17:42:24 The unavoidable need to transition from FINITE carbon-based energy presents a prime opportunity for conservatives to prove their fiscal/business acumen. The fact that they refuse to tackle it just shows they have become PR for oil companies instead of legitimate political parties
3677 2018-10-09 17:42:24 It’s bizarre that you think thousands of scientists would conspire to accept government funding to do the thing that mainstream scientists despise the most, cheating. But that a handful of contrarians wouldn’t accept Big Oil funding to do the same thing.
3678 2018-10-09 17:42:20 Any idea what global temperature will be by then? I'll give you a hint. In the absence of major vulcanism between now and then, likely 1.2-1.3°C above historical baseline. Emissions from oil&gas production are killing off the industry's own economic prospects. And yours and mine.
3679 2018-10-09 17:42:16 Like yeah oil companies and stuff are awful for the environment and need to be stopped but that doesn’t give u all a free pass to just not do anything to help except complain on the internet lol DO UR PART!!!

3702 2018-10-09 17:40:17 No surprise there, in reality, China was trying to impose its military might on a stealth basis around the seas of Japan and the US was wise to China's move so the supply of Oil and other commodities from the US is no longer a bargaining chip.

3768 2018-10-09 17:35:36 Central Govt. charges a fixed amount as tax on oil. The States independently charge their VAT & States benefit from higher oil prices. The average VAT rate in the country is about 29%. It’s all clear who gets what.

3770 2018-10-09 17:35:28 Ramen is different to the curry.
Personally I would recommend anything from the Fry section, it's all nice, even the vegatsu(although that is entirely preference if you like vegan dishes or not).

Donburi's are all nice, I liked the duck donburi with soya sauce and chili oil
3771 2018-10-09 17:35:02 RCMP should allow HEMP CBD no thc. Has anyone Asked if HEMP CBD oil is allowed & will be covered by prescription? So many lump HEMP CBD in with THC and it wouldn’t be surprising if @BCRCMPMedia @RalphGoodale Wrongly do as well.

3773 2018-10-09 17:34:59 Thats good but the problem is with the dustributors. Due to high demand for cooking oil they are now increasing their prices. I think if it can be distributed through supermarkets only who can ration to end users it will be good.
3774 2018-10-09 17:34:48 Getting rid of the oil money clubs would also help curtail some clubs having an extra edge

3777 2018-10-09 17:34:35 Not that I should be giving out about the slight reprieve in the aul pair giving out about the cost of a fill of oil, but no #CarbonTax change seems like an empty gesture. Yes, paying more is shite but lads the planet is in a hape  #Budget18 @Paschald @IRLDeptFinance
3778 2018-10-09 17:34:33 Sometimes you have to enjoy your home. Call it a day. Everything else outside your house can wait. At home, oganize. Laundry. Take your time. Deep clean rooms. Remove furniture to wipe down floors with Murphy's oil soap. Smells so heavenly. #TuesdayThoughts
3779 2018-10-09 17:34:31 So easy! Add a bit of oil and salt to thinly sliced onions and let them cook down at a simmer for about two hours. When ready, roll out dough, spread with onion, top with a little mozzarella and Parmesan, top with mandoline-sliced potato and thyme and sage. Bake, and voilà!

3781 2018-10-09 17:34:22 "I never understood the opposition to this line of thought." 
It's capitalism. The very nature of which is intense greed, so they are intent on extracting every last drop of oil & gas, even if it destroys the world for them too. Cap. is a cancer of the mind, which destroys logic.

3786 2018-10-09 17:33:58 Can also try the CBD oil for dogs. No negative results but a lot of positive feedback.
3787 2018-10-09 17:33:58 Your suspicion is correct. Well, I suppose I could change 'promises' to 'confident predictions'. I didn't believe Davis' snake oil salesmanship for a minute. But he was, as I recall, shadow home secretary at one point. Johnson was Mayor of London and Gove has been Ed Sec. They
3788 2018-10-09 17:33:41 I'm over my cold today, and have already gotten my flu shot + check up, got my oil and brake fluid changed, and am on my way to the grocery store. The lesson here? Take time to recover! Your health outweighs your productivity, and the world will still be here when you're better.
3789 2018-10-09 17:33:34 Same way you respected the Windrush generation? Never trust a Tory is the message everyone is quickly learning, snake oil is all you have to sell

3794 2018-10-09 17:32:16 That's an oil painting. Looks beautiful. I'm hungry now. Would you like to invite me over. You'd be safe. Don't worry.

3795 2018-10-09 17:32:15 I should get into the oil production business... become Ms. Rockefeller!
3796 2018-10-09 17:32:15 Jim Bakker is basically Alex Jones in this dept. Using a conspiracy theory to sell his snake oil.
3797 2018-10-09 17:32:07 This is hyper optimistic it’s 10 to 20 years away most likely closer to the latter and the EV industry uses plenty of resources so it at this point is not cleaner than Oil so resent being manipulated into it. Fine developers R&D even better get  hydrogen cars out - which r better
3798 2018-10-09 17:32:02 Oil tycoon
3799 2018-10-09 17:32:00 Anything for the oil merchants.
3800 2018-10-09 17:32:00 He did it by deferring oil payments. All the deferments are now maturing and new government is bearing the burden.

3804 2018-10-09 17:31:36 I learned that echinacea in pure oil form gives me a “high”

So.

There’s that. 
3805 2018-10-09 17:31:30 The 'unique way we are funded' by having our revenues taken & getting pocket money back aye? 
I can't wait until ALL Scottish revenues stay in Scotland. Charge others for our water, oil, gas & electricity. Charge rent til trident goes
Just think how much extra we could fund then.
3806 2018-10-09 17:31:28 Things like palm oil and chocolate that have been grown for a long time in terrible ways are much, much worse in terms of the effects production has on various societies where they're grown.
3807 2018-10-09 17:31:26 I think health is more important than money.
I do not believe the propaganda for one minute

Oil and gas has huge investment in Colorado already. 
You aren’t going anywhere.

Stop the fear mongering.

3810 2018-10-09 17:31:02 Paying for an oil change just pisses me off. I’m not trying to be this kind of an adult.
3811 2018-10-09 17:31:01 I always use lavender as a base oil

3813 2018-10-09 17:30:56 "Top horse and buggy maker says Model-T mania has reached peak absurdity"
Except in this case the horse and buggy makers are the auto and oil industry and they have massive regulatory capture over govt regulations. Govt regs biggest obstacle to autonomous electric vehicle freedom
3814 2018-10-09 17:30:52 “....entire economic socialist plan to grab our money....” What, just like the government subsidised big oil, coal and gas multinationals and their projects? What about the tech and medical state investment? Housing tax subsidies? These are all “socialist” by proxy, no?
3815 2018-10-09 17:30:50 Don’t get me wrong, I’m excited to see DX at Crown Jewel, but the fact that the WWE is pretending that we don’t all know that it’s because a Saudi prince threw millions of dollars of bloody oil money at them is pretty funny

3824 2018-10-09 17:30:15 "Surging oil prices mean that India’s current-account deficit is estimated to widen to $75 billion in the fiscal year to March, or 2.8 percent of gross domestic product, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That would be the highest since fiscal 2013". Hindustan Times

3833 2018-10-09 17:29:17 My friends just flamed me for 30 minutes straight because my car was 7000 miles past needing an oil change  I ain’t know

3835 2018-10-09 17:29:13 it is therefore that they prefer African products to European products.
like citrus fruits, oil, olives ... so that our southern countries have to sell their products under the price? and thus create unemployed people in EU?
3836 2018-10-09 17:29:13 This might take a few years but all the tech is in place for it to happen... govt regulations are biggest hurdle. Auto/oil industry has massive regulatory capture over govt regulations so I'm sure they're going to do everything they can to prevent autonomous electric vehicles
3837 2018-10-09 17:29:12 I thought I was about to have to pay for an oil change but it was free

3848 2018-10-09 17:27:39 True.  And Powell let BushJr. use him to tell the UN the lie that Iraq had WMDs, for the invasion pretext of the oil cabal, the real "axis of evil".  So, uh, let's get Powell to admit that he lied, for a start.  Then we'll hear his truth more clearly.

3852 2018-10-09 17:27:13 Besides, think about all the "subsidies" we give to big oil. We have the military protecting oil's flow.  We treat our atmosphere as a sewer dump. Those are real costs ("subsidies").

We are very close to killing ICE, but we like to speed it up if we can.  IMO every year matters.

3858 2018-10-09 17:26:40 Sounds like he talking about a policy around oil/energy. If he’s pushing fossil fuels, then he wrong. If he meets that policy he’s wrong. This is real world, not some simple score setting method.
3859 2018-10-09 17:26:18 Nigeria is far worse compared to Kenya. Sectarian violence, tribalism, corruption, oil scandals, and terrorist attacks are the order of the day in the so-called giant of Africa.

is a jackass.
3865 2018-10-09 17:25:58 Especially when Saddam decided he wanted to trade the oil in euros and not the dollar, Huge no no. Nothing to do with terrorism, everything to do with securing the oil fields.

3871 2018-10-09 17:25:38 I'm not PTI supporter & I know you came late at the scene, but there were no structural reforms during PMLN tenure. Public utilities like gas & electricity were bleeding dry. Record loses by PIA & Steel mill. Export down by 15%. You were lucky to have a record low oil prices.
3872 2018-10-09 17:25:28 Co2 emissions from sub-surface magma (not just volcanic eruptions) is estimated to be 0.6 billion metric tons per year, about 60 times less than man made CO2. However co2 from a volcanic eruption may exceed man made CO2 for a few hours.

What is that stock? I just miss it.

3898 2018-10-09 17:22:46 ‘You have to understand there are ancient healing modalities that have existed, the power of oils and crystals, for thousands of years people find really, really effective,' @GwynethPaltrow said. @BBC weren’t tough enough. @goop peddles snake oil to rich women. That is all.
3899 2018-10-09 17:22:43 Even when I don't click that checkbox, cutlery is never provided. It all depends on the restaurant. Also, for the unwell part, it is a request to the hotel guy to use less spices and oil. They usually don't comply.
3900 2018-10-09 17:22:40 You forgot salmon, beef & Irn Bru too, oil is at an over inflated price, maybe something to do with an embargo, do you remember 2014 & the collapse, where would you Nats been then...
3901 2018-10-09 17:22:35 Oil doesn't factor. I can read. The most intense Atlantic hurricane to ever make landfall was in 1961. 2017, in terms of frequency, is tied with 1936. In terms of major storms and Cat 5, 2017 is tied with 1933. Read and think for yourself. You don't need oil for that.

3904 2018-10-09 17:22:11 Contacting an oil painter about what the value of his painting from years ago makes about as much sense as contacting the Rolling Stones to ask them what today's value of the original pressing of Beggar's Banquet is.

3916 2018-10-09 17:20:34 What!!!! You mean if we had got independence last time around I wouldn't actually of received discounted fuel because of our oil, as the SNP canvassers promised? Now I know why they left when I asked them to repeat it with my phone recording.

This state has had enough politicians getting rich off guns and oil baron kick backs to last a lifetime. It’s a story as old as Texas.

Texas should belong to Texans, not The Koch’s or the NRA.

3943 2018-10-09 17:17:39 So I’ve been afraid for a few days to look under my hood and face what’s really wrong with my car. I finally did it and saw what the problem is: I forgot to screw on the lid after I added a quart of oil two weeks ago.
3944 2018-10-09 17:17:38 Where was the baby oil posed to go cuz hell no
3945 2018-10-09 17:17:29 cost and lobby. oil is still big money and they want to squeeze every ounce of profit until they can't. and by can't, either it runs out or the demand dramatically lower

3954 2018-10-09 17:16:35 Maybe re training these oil men in solar energy for example would help bring more people to rally against fossil fuels.
3955 2018-10-09 17:16:34 To add to this, from a perspective of someone who's worked 7 out of 12 years in oil refineries, it's much more expensive to install retro-fit pollution control mechanisms in an existing plant than it is to just do it right from the get go. China and India just dont give a shit
3956 2018-10-09 17:16:16 Who are you going to trust? Old people who are paid by big oil or scientists? #deadline2030
3957 2018-10-09 17:16:15 I guess it depends on what level of the infrastructure you’re looking at. For example, for planes to exist you don’t need airport infrastructure, but you do need the oil infrastructure required for the gasoline to be distributed.
3958 2018-10-09 17:16:14 Did you know most kitchen manufacturers recommend cleaning your cabinets with mild soap and warm water. Most recommend using Murphy’s Oil Soap.

3960 2018-10-09 17:16:14 It will be forgotten in a month. Oil takes over and arm deals of course.

3971 2018-10-09 17:15:42 When Bernie starts complaining about rising interest rates and oil prices, I may listen.
3972 2018-10-09 17:15:31 Right.  As soon as we end our dependence on SA making love to Israel, SA keeping oil prices down, SA running our proxy war in Yemen, SA running interference for us against Iran.  Right.
3973 2018-10-09 17:15:29 PRIVATE, there you go.
I think coal, oil, gas etc., should be replaced.
look at the benefits of wind / solar.

I cant see where we're going with this

3976 2018-10-09 17:14:38 The reason we are not already _well_ underway on to the path is because of selfish people. I won’t spout my discount Marxism on to you, but Oil & Gas industry interests are indistinguishable from state interests in many places. They’ll kill us to become richer. 5/
3977 2018-10-09 17:14:29 we have to use vegetable oil to clean up in printmaking (cos the ink we use is oil based) and it's so gross feeling. and now my hands still smell like oil.

3981 2018-10-09 17:14:24 Why canola oil? It comes from Canola. NOT palm trees, hence the name.
3982 2018-10-09 17:14:18 Woke up this morning with the meat sweats and it occurred to me that humans are basically just walking oil diffusers. So gross. 
3983 2018-10-09 17:14:12 I don't take the words of former president olusegun obasanjo serious,if he is now saying that we need people who understand the economy how come during the time Nigeria was having oil boom what stops him from diversifying our economy how come he cannot start
3984 2018-10-09 17:14:07 I had some respect for @Busisa74 but had reservations. Just heard him on @ZiFMNews saying there is no shortage of cooking oil. Come on this level of lying is unmatched @iZimPhoto1 @bayhaus

4037 2018-10-09 17:08:57 Yes.

Aim: increase number of trades & make retail investors to lose. Your views?

4043 2018-10-09 17:08:13 This CBD oil really has you buzzing.
4044 2018-10-09 17:07:46 Never have I agreed with you so much...CBD oil helped me overcome an opiate addiction... Over a year clean
4045 2018-10-09 17:07:39 @IPCC_CH #SR15 SPM (figure 3b) says 2010-2030 growth in unabated fossil fuel demand to achieve 1.5C can be at most 21% for #naturalgas and 3% for #oil (oh and -59% for coal) #energytransitionnow

4047 2018-10-09 17:07:36 We live in a world where you have to choose an oil change over your health
4048 2018-10-09 17:07:13 nikki haley really just did the dave chapelle bit where he spills water and runs when someone asks dubya about oil in the middle east

Did nazi america sabotage the oil refinery in NB to compromise Canada's gasoline resources, 
To cause us to import from nazi america-first refineries?
It is punishment because @cafreeland wouldn't role over? 
Is it terrorism perped by nazi america?

4058 2018-10-09 17:06:32 The divisions are in the economic bases. Oil vs renewables, Internet companies vs ISPs, service vs industrial, all generally Dems vs GOP respectively. The parties ultimately only feign any division in order to advance their bases' economic sectors. They are united on imperialism.
4059 2018-10-09 17:06:32 oil avoid krke bhi tune kya ghnta ukhad lya dedh pasli

4062 2018-10-09 17:06:20 I have heard of that as well as MCT oil, which is derived from coconut oil. I haven't tried it.
4063 2018-10-09 17:06:15 @KTM_UK Chains aren't covered under warrenty? How can chains not be covered under warrenty when your bike is basically brand new. I'm going to have to pay £180 for a new one with labour aswell as taking the bike to my local dealer for oil consumption issues and a new abs sensor..
4064 2018-10-09 17:06:07 That's interesting, maybe she has a low fat diet. I know when I first started taking CBD oil regularly I did notice some ~differences~ in my digestion so I can see how it could go bad for some people with IBS  I'm glad it helped your joint pain, maybe a topical would be better!
4065 2018-10-09 17:05:57 EU says EU states decided to create a “Special Purpose Vehicle” to channel payments to Iranian exports, including oil & Iranian imports, “to assist and reassure economic operators pursuing legitimate business with Iran.”
SPV will help Iran to keep selling its oil valued in euros.

4071 2018-10-09 17:05:14 The oil (blessing) reserved for you will not flow for anyone else.  No one can take your blessing.  That’s why you don’t need to get upset when others get blessed.  They have their blessings and you have yours.

4076 2018-10-09 17:04:52 look delicious!! I just fry them up with oil and garlic and eat them over pasta c: They're meaty enough to carry themselves!
4077 2018-10-09 17:04:50 Everyone knows that true mastery comes from using Nuln Oil.
4078 2018-10-09 17:04:49 Environmental movement needs to move on from climate catastrophism. Breeds negativity and apathy.  A lot can and is being done. The fossil fuel industry is on its way out - even the oil companies realise that. Renewables are taking over far more rapidly than anyone imagined 1/5
4079 2018-10-09 17:04:37 Curtis Culwell, former supt shares the 
1. good (oil is up), 
2. bad (Robin Hood districts have grown fr 35 to 200), &
3. ugly (property tax payers are contributing a disproportionate amt to public ed, a State constitutional responsibility). #txed #txlege
4080 2018-10-09 17:04:15 Where is oil in Biafra land?
4081 2018-10-09 17:04:06 idk who needs to hear this but i know someone does.
get your fucking oil changed 
4082 2018-10-09 17:04:03 There's also the prospect of rising competition in the sector. Oil prices are attractive.
4083 2018-10-09 17:03:57 There was still a lamplighter in the Middle Temple 1985-86. I recall him walking around at night with a 10ft pole full of oil, flame lit at top to light gaslamps. Nice old boy, v chatty & huge red drinker’s nose.
4084 2018-10-09 17:03:57 Doesnt a volcano produce more CO2 than most humans can produced so this is kinda a mute point....

4086 2018-10-09 17:03:45 They don't sit there burning their own oil and eating their own cows. Consumers do.
4087 2018-10-09 17:03:40 Did figure out how to monetize climate change. If they don't back oil baron Koch brothers, campaign money dries up, they don't get re-elected, must support "hoax" theory. McConnell - down the line. Deranged. For articles?  NYT. Or Grist 6/8/16. Business Insider 6/1/17 #VoteBlue
4088 2018-10-09 17:03:33 I think it’s @cnn and they have the credibility of a snake oil salesman.
4089 2018-10-09 17:03:32 Education standard & creativity, zeal taken over by uncertainty. Still report may not be that accurate. We have to stop blaming others. We forgot patratisam, use Indian products which may be costlier, follow Germany. Oil exploration is must.
4090 2018-10-09 17:03:22 Why people? What boats and other species are for. Take the bullet for people. So melodramatic. Get a chai tea and patchouli oil. We got this.
4091 2018-10-09 17:03:20 Thats 2 different treatments as 1.

ACV and Bentonite Clay mainly clean the hair. Also restores curl pattern. Can replace shampoo

Avocado Olive oil Treatment repairs damaged hair and gives moisture.

Please next time split them ok?

Оказывается достаточно просто быть нелюбимым человеком у воспитательницы, чтобы оказаться вовлечённым в какую-то херню.
Под предлогом самой пинающей меня отправляют на всратый конкурс.

Без моего согласия. При том, что я мало пинаю. И завтра у нас классовая поездка
4093 2018-10-09 17:03:03 My guy just gave me oil that cane in supreme packaging?
4094 2018-10-09 17:02:59 Haha... to be fair, the mini I won an award for had no agrax (at least not on the model). It was shaded entirely from 50/50 mix of nuln oil and drakenhoff nightshade, then painted using glazes over dry brushing... completely out of my comfort zone...
4095 2018-10-09 17:02:53 And that's why i am hundred percent right in my assessment. Its hurting for you to even see punjab name, while our children are killed and incapacitated, it doesn't matter to you. Remember those oil thieves of punjab who had burnt, later given 30 lakh each.Can i imagine for ours
4096 2018-10-09 17:02:48 America loves your oil. Plain and simple.
4097 2018-10-09 17:02:47 They think that by millers  publishing they are producing cooking oil, we must NOT panic. Yet, there’s no oil on shelves.Countless businesses not trading, others trading solely in usd sales, they assume WE are stupid!! We may b blind but we r not dumb.
4098 2018-10-09 17:02:46 Like how tf do you take the time to make a dildo out of VS paper and a condom AND use baby oil...lmfao...I pray for sis vagina

4103 2018-10-09 17:01:53 not for nothing but WWE has been fleecing Saudi oil princes since they first started auctioning AJ Lee/Paige ringwear/gear merch
4104 2018-10-09 17:01:51 The problem was your school didn’t have oil under it.

4108 2018-10-09 17:01:35 I make and sell oraginc oil nd black soap.
4109 2018-10-09 17:01:35 Let's not get out the anointing oil yet

4111 2018-10-09 17:01:34 Atiku can announce a diverse shadow cabinet in order to use that to douse the pressure of where the VP candidate come from. e.g. shadow NSA from NW; shadow Defence from NC; shadow Oil Ministry adviser SS; Finace SE; shadow Justice Ministry & interior SW.
4112 2018-10-09 17:01:33 We simply cannot disengage with the Saudis, not when we're beholden to them. In July we imported 876K barrels of oil from the country, 11% of our total imports. We can't survive as a country without imported oil, and that won't change until we get serious about alternatives.
4113 2018-10-09 17:01:28 TOTAL STOPPED BUYING IRANIAN CRUDE OIL IN JULY; REPLACING IRANIAN CRUDE WITH SAUDI, PROBABLY OTHERS - CEO: BBG.
4114 2018-10-09 17:01:25 "that the problem of fuel mixing with oil probably stems from one of two causes: improperly designed fuel injectors that spray fuel directly onto the cylinder walls or the engine not heating up enough to vaporize gasoline left over in an engine cylinder." Yup. Use that loud pedal
4115 2018-10-09 17:01:11 Ik this is weird but drink like a cap full of olive oil before you go
4116 2018-10-09 17:01:07 Are you concerned that your car is going to start needing more work now that it’s getting older? Remember, keeping up with oil changes and other aspects of regular maintenance can keep your car running better for longer.
4117 2018-10-09 17:01:03 Your dear NOI and her gang allocated lesser money to capital projects, can’t even save the excess made from crude oil.. as if that’s not enough they depleted our reserves to about $29bn despite earning more
4118 2018-10-09 17:01:02 Finally got time to get my oil changed my day is fulfilled 
4119 2018-10-09 17:00:56 Preston shame on you. I'm not a lawyer. But i can see a pattern in your crypto industry of fools parading as experts. It's the hallmark of snake oil merchants in the turn of the century
4120 2018-10-09 17:00:55 True BUT - those top 100 companies are almost all oil and coal companies, so we as consumers DO have a responsibility to choose renewable sources of energy even when that’s hard / more expensive, forcing these companies to innovate and reduce harmful production
4121 2018-10-09 17:00:53 but some bio oil on it and it should be okay to use
4122 2018-10-09 17:00:48 My mum orders it purely thc and cbd oil with a high percentage dose. My step dad is coming back to senses

4125 2018-10-09 17:00:40 Most IBS has bad reactions with high fat content foods and diuretics (which cbd oil is both of) so its likely that that is the exception rather than the rule, since my experience ive spoken to everyone i know with digestive issues, all of whom have similar negative experiences

4132 2018-10-09 17:00:17 Oh, please. Price carbon and stop subsidising oil - the market will take care of the rest.
4133 2018-10-09 17:00:12 I'm a Nigerian. We got our independence 1960 and oil was discovered and the country has made more money for itself than our colonial masters could dream of but yet we still improvised. Nigeria is currently the poverty capital of the world. And we are INDEPENDENT....

4140 2018-10-09 16:59:28 Nationalization still does some things that are irreversible like eroding trust in the government. Future investment into the economy becomes much riskier if there is fear that the government could just take your assets. And I don't trust socialists to stop at oil.

4158 2018-10-09 16:57:16 So Food World is selling cooking oil in US  only 10$ will get you 3 bottles= 6 litres but 10$ is 35 bond and 40 ecocash which means a 2 ltr bottle of oil is being sold at 12 bond yet the same bottle was going for only 4bond just last week 2018 is gonna get worse than 2008

4162 2018-10-09 16:57:04 Sounds like coal is to NZ as oil is to Canada: they can't stop production immediately anymore than we can. I would like to hear, however, that they have plans to transition away from coal as quickly as possible without serious impacts to their economy and their working folks.
4163 2018-10-09 16:57:03 If you think oil and water mix well.
4164 2018-10-09 16:56:59 Once it's fully healed, try using bio oil on it. It won't make it go away but it will reduce the look of it!

4174 2018-10-09 16:56:00 Wait o! How did @MBuhari and @ProfOsinbajo managed to save almost $47B when oil was at a lowest price? There will be less death among pensioners these days. Everybody is jubilating for alert. ISTANDWITHGPMB!
4175 2018-10-09 16:56:00 Chudia is not da mudda... But U are diverting the debate in a wrong direction Madam #anjanaomkashyap... Make some debate to help common man's favour... Why Oil prices hike again? Why the rate increases in daily used goods but in income of common man. I think U should ask Govt..
4176 2018-10-09 16:55:59 Fashion is the 2nd largest environmental disaster after oil.

4183 2018-10-09 16:54:54 NDS (VAT) is a third of budget revs by itself so it’s the one that makes biggest difference. Also it’s maybe the “fairest” as the more you spend the more you contribute to budget. Still the very poor prob feel the most pain. Remember also big oil & metal tax hikes too
4184 2018-10-09 16:54:49 I decided to do this Bentonite clay hair treatment I saw @elah_bee  do. I decided to add avocado and olive oil to it.(I thought I had oil) just to get home to find I didn't have any oil.. So what did I do? Added small vegetable oil like that 
4185 2018-10-09 16:54:44 Do i have to tell you? He came during the oil crack down yet our power, foreign reserve, . . . have increased. Alot of looted money recovered. I wonder what would hv happened had it been we have ppl like corrupt #Atiku on power.
4186 2018-10-09 16:54:25 Instead of burning coal or oil we should burn the rich.

4188 2018-10-09 16:53:58 Which mistakes?  
Could Qaddafi's mistake have been, to believe a War Mongering twat like Tony Blurt or the fact he started to sell Libyan oil in Euro's not $$?
4189 2018-10-09 16:53:53 That's castor oil...I think originally
4190 2018-10-09 16:53:52 On top of what situation when buying 2 litres cooking oil for $10-00
4191 2018-10-09 16:53:51 As we speak oil price is 80 usd Per barell but nobody talks about it anymore why because when it was low it was the basis for another excuse for incompetence now it’s high they switched to corruption.
4192 2018-10-09 16:53:47 A great alternative to Neosporin is peanut butter. Not like the actual butter that would be disgusting, you can use just the oil that sits on top

4194 2018-10-09 16:53:33 Nothings free, tax payers or home owners will be stuck with the expense unless transit employees are going to volunteer their time for free, and oil companies are going to provide free fuel. See nothing is for free someone will have to pay.
4195 2018-10-09 16:53:28 Mad how Pellegrini won City the league title & league cup, gets them  oil money gang  to #UCL semis & fans dont give him the respect he deserves but when Pep win same trophies  & gets knocked out of the #UCL QFs, , hes a genius.

In the words of Adeniyi Ojo Onukaba, Atiku’s oil services and logistics company INTELS alone makes over 1 billion Dollars annually.
In Buhari’s time spanners were thrown into the works of INTEL.
In all, Atiku Abubakar faces the polity head-on

4209 2018-10-09 16:51:35 no, they are a federal republic, not unlike America. socialist policies were tried and failed because A. Nicolas Maduro is a Dictator, and B.they dont work that well when you have Oil as your biggest export. Speaking of food, do you recall the 12 billion dollar payout to farmers?

4216 2018-10-09 16:51:07 Why are you negotiated with the opposition? If USA doesn’t want foreign countries interfering in our politics, USA must stop meddling in others’ countries politics. Get out of Venezuela. You clearly are only working for oil companies not the American people.
4217 2018-10-09 16:51:06 Don't forget, our target price on oil was $88.88, now $84.68 as at today.  The same was about $25 dollars when our current president resumed some four years ago. Now, the economy is away from recession and .....
4218 2018-10-09 16:51:01 Ha ha.. then stay dependent on Oil supplying nation, bear the burn whenever US plays with sanctions and pay from your pocket taxes to cover up fiscal deficit mess. See more defaults since profit will not move up till cost goes down.

4226 2018-10-09 16:50:41 Hard to predict what would happen- the Soviet Union nationalized making alcohol & made more of it. Venezuela nationalized oil & pump less of it, waste more of it & still plan to set it all on fire one day.

4230 2018-10-09 16:50:11 All the more reason to keep the US energy independent so, we don’t have to rely on the Middle East for oil.  We all know they hate the US.
4231 2018-10-09 16:50:11 No thank you, @ClickedTazer, @RealBWC, and yourself are taking the snake oil salesmen out to he woodshed. They prey on kids and could care less about their audiences. The three of you are a wake up call. So thank you and keep up the great work!
4232 2018-10-09 16:50:08 One day in the not too distant future people will be astounded that any fossil fuels were burned for energy.

4244 2018-10-09 16:48:59 There were no external factors, were you born after 2015? 2012 oil prices reached record high, only second to the 2008 record highs, which lead to a balance of payment crises, Last govt din't enjoy the record law oil prices which consume most of our imports! like these losers.
4245 2018-10-09 16:48:58 "The fed gov't doesn't have a $10 a barrel tax on oil, though Texas and other states do levy oil production through what are known as severance taxes.

Turns out they are doing fine, with higher pensions and lower claiming age than the UK - without being "uniquely" funded the fuck out of.
4251 2018-10-09 16:48:23 I gotta go get an oil change after work today.  I’d love to just go straight home just once

4253 2018-10-09 16:48:11 I find the chemical properties of textiles fascinating, but also good god the water and land usage that goes into so-called "sustainable, ethical" textiles is APPALLING, and don't get me started on nylon, which is literally made from crude oil.
4254 2018-10-09 16:48:10 40 years ago this is where E10 was oil fought the farmers then and they will now.

4278 2018-10-09 16:46:14 Tough days everyday for WCS, but don't think the Irving Oil Refinery should have an impact as all of their barrels are foreign, mostly imported from Saudi Arabia and their products sell to the NE U.S. market.
4279 2018-10-09 16:46:14 Q: how about oil palm, US import. Could you give me some information statistic.
4280 2018-10-09 16:46:10 U.S. crude prices were modestly higher on Tuesday as nearly one-fifth of daily oil production was lost from offshore Gulf of #Mexico wells due to Hurricane Michael.

4290 2018-10-09 16:45:10 Artic/Offshore Drilling = Can be considered very safe if implemented very carefully with strong infrastructure. Eliminates need to buy oil from Russia & the ME. Allows us to become oil independent and drives prices down. Fracking is a problem, but oil is very safe.

4295 2018-10-09 16:44:38 You don’t even need to ditch oil for that, you don’t burn the oil to make plastics, so it doesn’t create air pollution. We’d still need to replace it eventually, but in terms of air pollution that’s not a big deal
4296 2018-10-09 16:44:23 i definitely let my last car engine explode because i didn’t know you had to get oil changes

4299 2018-10-09 16:43:47 I've read analyses suggesting that, yes, essentially all the oil we can drill with today's tech is going to get burned by someone, end-consumer or industry; the price has more to do with who than whether. So we've gotta #KeepItInTheGround.

4306 2018-10-09 16:43:07 I think it's Alberta--very conservative compared to the rest of Canada. I've talked to a surprising number here who like the way he talks or think he should 'be given a chance.' There are a lot of oil company employees her, which prob has something to do with it.
4307 2018-10-09 16:43:03 Pour oil on the water and set it on fire.
4308 2018-10-09 16:43:01 Yesss, plus Korean moisturizing face wash and egg Freeman masks! I've also taken to adding a bit of coconut oil to baths once or twice a week, which is why I'm all glowy and so soft to the touch!
4309 2018-10-09 16:42:55 They have a huge amount of oil ,but can't eat that.
4310 2018-10-09 16:42:54 Waiting on an oil change this morning and the TV in the dealership reminds me of why I've never had cable. I'm convinced this is just ads with a bit of news programming thrown in
4311 2018-10-09 16:42:54 Honestly, I am surprised russia hasn't run out of money to pay these trolls. I guess trump's iran sanctions boosting oil prices will help putin fund is plundering+trolls.

4319 2018-10-09 16:41:53 Y v r not ready to accept the fact that this devaluation was overdue for long time 
When trade gap has swollen to 30bln $ plus due to negative growth in export & international oil prices has increased by 50%
There is no way to stop this devaluation unless v reduce trade gap
4320 2018-10-09 16:41:35 But oil prices have gone back up. How come the Naira is still stuck on $1 : N350 ??

4323 2018-10-09 16:41:20 Hey super rich money loving people, all of your wealth is stored & invested in this planet. It's all going to just vanish if you don't wake up and start fixing things/stop pushing coal/oil/plastics/etc. 
@elonmusk & @richardbranson aren't going to fly you to the moon in time.
4324 2018-10-09 16:41:19 The people holding the money and the electronic controls appear to want a new global northern axis - GB, the US, and RU -with joint security to keep people sweltering from global warming out, while keeping them dependent on oil.
4325 2018-10-09 16:41:17 Don't have peppermint oil but I have eucalyptus & tea tree oil. Will that work?
Didn't sleep well last night so that could be the cause of headache too.

4327 2018-10-09 16:41:08 @RepSwalwell is a divisive snake and a snake oil salesmen. You have been one of the leading voices in the division of America and a perfect example of a hateful politician willing to say anything to keep political power.
4328 2018-10-09 16:41:06 GxFR Hall & Nash. It's a raw piece of work, like unfiltered castor oil. At first you may say yuck, but you'll be searching for the yuck like a sick person looking Buckley 's
4329 2018-10-09 16:41:06 During Pmln tenure oil remained under 50$/B on avg. Got injection of $$s from CPEC still pmln brought crisis in economy. The retarded PPP had left 450B of circular dept when crude oil price was at  $100+/B and Pmln left 1200B when oil was cheap. PMLN proven worst than PPP.
4330 2018-10-09 16:40:58 @FoxBusiness tell Gasparino to come to Texas and look at the wage growth here. it has been astronomical. where else can a truck driver make 120,000 a year except in the oil field in Texas. McDonald’s is paying $14 an hour to start.  wages all across the state have gone up

As said on BBC evening news, so once again your talking rubbish, a made up deficit from England's treasury , of course they're going to show Scotland poorer, why? For oil, gas, food drink etc
4340 2018-10-09 16:40:06 The oil (blessing) reserved for you will not flow for anyone else.  No one can take your blessing.  That’s why you don’t need to get upset when others get blessed.  They have their blessings and you have yours.

4343 2018-10-09 16:39:38 What are your thoughts about CBD (Cannabis oil)this does not give you the “high” but it does help with CHRONIC pain. Is that considered a sin to use(eat,vape,rub,pill)?Is this like taking pain killers?Is it just view differently since it cannabis and can be smoked?#sin #christian

4349 2018-10-09 16:39:09 I do a rub of vegetable oil, paprika, cumin, curry powder, Tabasco, red pepper flakes and cajun seasoning. Let it sit overnight then smoke for 4 hours (about 2lb of pork) at 200 degrees.

4381 2018-10-09 16:35:35 Well, what if there are FACTS that back up the "imagination" of the climate scientists, on the climate change debate? It's been PROVEN that the recent climate change is mainly caused by Humans and especially our CO2/greenhouse gas emissions. So, oil = bad source of energy. 1/?
4382 2018-10-09 16:35:29 Nigga wake up have 20 missed calls and 10+ messages that oil be doing me dirty 
4383 2018-10-09 16:35:28 Biggest oil market impact from Hurricane Michael comes next Wednesday when EIA inevitably shows a sharp drop in US crude production numbers. Otherwise, it's a demand destruction event - -not behind most recent WTI or Brent rally (Hint, it's Iran that matters)

4392 2018-10-09 16:35:00 Interesting that we in the UK have our own "moderates". They support invasions of foreign countries - often, coincidentally, where oil can be found - and privatisation of healthcare and other vital services. People who want publicly run health, transport, utilities are extreme???
4393 2018-10-09 16:34:59 That doesn't mean I'm for pollution, or oil products, or the corporate destruction of the planet. I'm for back yard gardens, solar panels, clotheslines and low impact living...  It doesn't mean I'm Conservative or Liberal or NDP. 

I'm for honest government is all.
4394 2018-10-09 16:34:59 Same here, dude.  A change in leadership is not going to make much difference in the prosperity of Alberta.  Better oil prices and a pipeline are going to do that.

4397 2018-10-09 16:34:33 Long years ago, a Muslim man saw in a dream that the U.S had invaded Afghanistan then Iraq then fought Iran (for a brief time), then invaded the oil rich eastern province of Saudi Arabia.

4414 2018-10-09 16:33:05 World governments give $400 billion/yr in oil subsidies (corporate welfare)

Maybe then our infrastructure wouldn't be powered by 19th century combustion engines
4415 2018-10-09 16:32:44 I thought I could until I took my car in for an oil change and they had to basically revive it
4416 2018-10-09 16:32:37 @hermesDE Kann es sein, dass in Troisdorf ein mittlerweile dauerhaftes Problem mit der Paketlogistik vorliegt? - Sa. wird die Oil Tankstelle nicht bedient (trotz garantierter Prime-Zustellung); andere Pakete werden zwar eingeladen, aber dann nicht zugestellt.Was ist da los?
4417 2018-10-09 16:32:33 Which oil do you use?
4418 2018-10-09 16:32:33 BUT YOU SHOULD'VE FULLY SCREWED IT BACK ON WITH OIL
4419 2018-10-09 16:32:24 Like oil on my hands
4420 2018-10-09 16:32:23 I generate 100% of my electricity using solar. No carbon emissions. It powers my car. There’s no reason to cling to and heavily subsidize coal & oil. We can lead in innovation if we choose to. But this has become a partisan issue because of the influence of entrenched energy $$$.
4421 2018-10-09 16:32:14 It's something I think a lot about as well (ik it's a little ironic BC I work for an oil company lol) but my take on the problem is that it's a long wavelength problem thats far enough out there that people don't think about it enough as individuals
4422 2018-10-09 16:32:08 Gotta be ! Like do you just drive ya car all year without getting an oil change and other maintenance done nah bitch you take a break from driving to make sure ya shit A1

4428 2018-10-09 16:31:21 Check that oil! When changing oil, always be sure to use the grade that is recommended by your manufacturer. This can improve your gas mileage by 1-2%!
4429 2018-10-09 16:31:20 Here's hoping you don't get the dreaded "gas in the oil" affliction I have read about with the turbo Hondas.
4430 2018-10-09 16:31:18 $1 before is now $100,000. They have oil but when the govt prioritizes themselves, natural riches r worthless. Theres diaspora of people to neighboring nations like Colombia. Ive read of Venezuelan lawyers turning tricks as gigolos. Ex jetsetters now clean houses. Bleak prospcts.
4431 2018-10-09 16:31:17 A snake oil salesman who is terribly confused about the snake he needs to bottle.
4432 2018-10-09 16:31:10 Which oil?
4433 2018-10-09 16:31:05 The government of Finland has revealed that peak oil was actually the work of Scott Porter in a jersey wig.
4434 2018-10-09 16:31:05 Michael, the hurricane, is likely to disrupt oil supply. Some platforms in the Gulf of Mexico have already been evacuated.
4435 2018-10-09 16:30:57 Wetin pesin no go see for Nigeria?!

Stepped out to get recharge card, and saw two peddlers: one with the skin that once belonged to a large python draped over his shoulders, and the other with a bucket of a congealed oily substance which they referred to as "snake oil".

4441 2018-10-09 16:30:37 It’s time to treat yourself to a delicious special at Zia’s! One of our amazing specials this week is Tortellini Spinachi—jumbo tortellini tosses in olive oil, butter and garlic with spinach and fresh red peppers.

4443 2018-10-09 16:30:27 Good post although dont think we need oil at $150 as you say just need some flaming discoveries for once and not hong kong phooey ones!
4444 2018-10-09 16:30:27 How sweet it is, I think we r all beginning to see through the smoke that maybe Nancy and Hilary aren’t the boogymen big oil wants us to think they r

4446 2018-10-09 16:30:25 Alberta currently IS shipping south, yet we STILL get screwed by our "friends" & neighbours there. The Oil price differential is currently around $40. So very nice of the US to discount our oil to the tune of about $150 million a day. Not a solution.
4447 2018-10-09 16:30:23 ink for ink ,oil for oil
4448 2018-10-09 16:30:16 Like a vampire, he drinks oil out of robots.
4449 2018-10-09 16:30:14 And they sit on the worlds largest supply of oil.
4450 2018-10-09 16:29:50 EXACTLY, that's why the incompetence of Jonathan coupled with his corrupt lifestyle led to the DEPLETION of Nigeria reserve during OIL BOOM, & borrowing to pay salary despite selling crude oil for 5 years.
Buhari in 3 years has displayed COMPETENCE+INTEGRITY....The diff is CLEAR!
4451 2018-10-09 16:29:38 WKWKWKWK becanda ih vin lo ngapain pake oil cleanser kan lo nggak makeupan, mending beli micellar water aja gue aja pake garnier kok membumi
4452 2018-10-09 16:29:34 If you need a source of the legit pure cannabis oil let me know.
4453 2018-10-09 16:29:31 The last few days i have been using too much oil in food. No idea why.
4454 2018-10-09 16:29:24 On p. 10 WSJ 10-8-18 see "...Dump the Dollar." It implies go to gold standard.. Gold is a commodity, just like wheat, oil, or orange juice.  It follows the law of price/demand.  If you couldn't  buy a copy, go to your local library. The whole p. is worth your time.
4455 2018-10-09 16:29:21 No the differences are too great and have carried on over a very long period of time for us to ever become compatible. Oil and water never mix.

4458 2018-10-09 16:29:05 My first time frying plantains with coconut oil and let me tell you I am never going back!!! This shit is soooooo bomb 
4459 2018-10-09 16:28:55 Shoulda been made my costume  now I still have to do that plus cook for my coworkers plus a lil shopping plus get a oil change plus homework & do my hair all today cause I won’t have time later this week . Why do I procrastinate 
4460 2018-10-09 16:28:45 They give me cooking oil 
4461 2018-10-09 16:28:43 Grabe!! Nag proproduced ng natural oil yung mukha ko  hahahahaha

4463 2018-10-09 16:28:14 We need $150 oil .. and someone to actually find the bloody stuff through the cloud of dusters and fuck ups.

We need Brexit to settle, Beaufort to compensate and the bandages removed from burnt crypto fingers..

Aim needs to use this downtime to sort it's house out generally.
4464 2018-10-09 16:28:04 When your mum messaged you asking where she can buy cannabis oil from... I like how out of her 4 children she comes to me about this 
4465 2018-10-09 16:28:01 Disagree. Property tax isn’t a regulatory tax. Putting a higher tax on DDT wouldn’t have worked, nor will increase tax on oil/gas/coal, which will only be passed on to consumers (ie the market) hitting the poor the hardest. We need real regulations, not economic hurdles.
4466 2018-10-09 16:27:54 I took too many omega fish oil capsules this morning and now my burps taste like Poseidon's asshole
4467 2018-10-09 16:27:51 Deep-frying a turkey can be done safely. First, the turkey must be completely thawed out. Second, do it outdoors in an open area, away from overhangs/porches. Third, right amount of cooking oil should be in the pot, heated slowly to the right temperature. Cook it at 3 min./pound.
4468 2018-10-09 16:27:51 i know that shit was uncomfortable she probably posted it before she even tried it.. & what is the baby oil for? 
4469 2018-10-09 16:27:30 So what? We wouldn't be here tweeting without science either.  That's the same science tells us that fossil fuels are making the planet try to kill us. Good news tho, science can help us reverse the damage and find better energy sources than oil.
4470 2018-10-09 16:27:29 Olives should only exist in the form of oil
4471 2018-10-09 16:27:23  that cooking oil doesn’t have tshomoliya 
4472 2018-10-09 16:27:22 My brother is awesome he took my car for an oil change 
4473 2018-10-09 16:27:20 done by machines nowadays. Machines eat energy. No energy, no modern  world, no current standard of living for hundreds of millions of  people. Capitalism just happen to have flourished at the same time  mankind discovered oil.
4474 2018-10-09 16:27:20 Aftermath of the gearbox failure on our Ibiza race car, This was driven for the final lap with no 3rd or 5th gear. 
We believe the issue is oil related so will be developing a oil cooler compatible with 02M / 02Q gearboxes

4476 2018-10-09 16:27:16 And yet you chose to leave. I grew up being told that Iran was the largest state sponsor of Terrorism in the world. I have no doubt thats true. That all the oil revenue generated over the past 40 years has gone to the IRG, AQ Khan & a nuclear weapons program. These are also facts
4477 2018-10-09 16:27:05 She certainly did. You know what that means.
4478 2018-10-09 16:27:02 The Oil aren't even staying at the hotel on strike hahaha, same group tried getting offended when Aaron Judge was on video walking into the same hotel last Thursday.
4479 2018-10-09 16:27:02 Tell me all about the AB provincial governments before the NDP that were able to generate jobs without waiting for the oil industry to bounce back after tanking. Better yet, tell me about the ones that even tried.
4480 2018-10-09 16:27:01 Again, straw man. We believe the people should control the means of production, not the government. And your reference to Venezuela is another straw man. They built their economy on oil, so of course it would not be sustainable. We believe in stopping #ClimateChange.
4481 2018-10-09 16:26:59 Yea. Also this is different from the significant reduction exemptions that'll be issued to some Iranian oil importers, probably China/India, which has more direct implications for global oil supply.

4495 2018-10-09 16:26:06 Yes, I’m going to start working the colored pencil over the soft pastel (its fixated), so you refine the drawing and go into subtle tones, once the black base is somewhat blocked by the pastel. My colored pencils are oil based, not wax based, so it lets me do layer after layer.
4496 2018-10-09 16:26:05 "A squeaky gear gets the oil."
4497 2018-10-09 16:26:03 @EPA Which EPA agency in New York City that I can report about a major car repair been done on the street with oil all over the street.
4498 2018-10-09 16:26:02 The patrol boat uses coal or refined oil for fuel. Hit "E" while in the boat to add fuel! Sorry about the confusion. We'll work on clarifying that. :)

4502 2018-10-09 16:25:52 So she’s putting baby oil… in her ass?
4503 2018-10-09 16:25:51 Baby oil

4505 2018-10-09 16:25:47 I don’t think you realize how much oil their is, spoiler alert, it’s never ending
4506 2018-10-09 16:25:46 Yes but all money NOT being filed into the pockets of oil is just liberal stupidity. Making everyone too poor to go to a national park will help ease the blow. They'll really never think outside of their personal wealth box.
4507 2018-10-09 16:25:46 Mostly selling Gas (3rd biggest globally) and Oil (13th biggest).  They do manage to make themselves look all nice and forward thinking though don't they.
4508 2018-10-09 16:25:43 Can I oil cleanse without it getting into my eye...the world may never know
4509 2018-10-09 16:25:34 it says "Mix gorilla snot with castor oil ecostylers to slick, then a small amount of got2be glued spray over the top after you’ve slicked it just before you scarf it. My shit stayed slick for 3 whole weeks "

4511 2018-10-09 16:25:08 Many birds and animals also ingest oil when they try to clean themselves, which can poison them.

4513 2018-10-09 16:24:46 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if youre frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.
4514 2018-10-09 16:24:40 Venezuela publishes oil over the iPhone X's processor is more sea salt – it out, trying not a little when you shake so both
4515 2018-10-09 16:24:27 I LOVE when my car goes in for an oil change and I find out my tire rod and alignment is off :)))))
4516 2018-10-09 16:24:25 Pretty much market consensus that oil will be around USD55 throughout 2019.

4520 2018-10-09 16:23:57 I liked Shawnee a lot; some really nice people. City size isn't the only thing that matters. Vestal has a big university, and a very diverse, international community. Shawnee is an old oil town, with some amazing bar-b-q. Economically, culturally, apples-and-oranges.

4524 2018-10-09 16:23:41 Experts also predicted we would be out of oil in 2000 back in 1972. If they can’t get the weather right for the weekend, I will not be waiting for the world to end any time soon!

4527 2018-10-09 16:23:31 This is how Nascar changes oil.

I love redneck logic.
4528 2018-10-09 16:23:28 No, I merrily burnt all the White Companies horrible wicker tatt once. Some had been used for butter, cheese, had oil spills on. Went up like a crashed Esso tanker. We also used to have occasional wooden bowl burnings. So pleasing at a deep, primitive level.

4537 2018-10-09 16:22:45 i'm not arguing that at all. yes focus is on oil & gas. but if talking specifically abt livestock, my understanding is main impact is ch4 (which yes, lasts for a shorter period but traps more heat than co2). not at all saying that deforestation has no impact.
4538 2018-10-09 16:22:45  when I was a kid, late 50's, we were told we only had 10 years left. Ice age was coming and we were running out of oil, so we'd all freeze to death in 10 years time.

4542 2018-10-09 16:22:22 Yes, up to 15% & starting next summer will b year round. Of course 16 Republicans from refinery states have sent a letter against this. I think oil barrens have enough $$$. Fuel prices fluctuate due 2 greed. This will help us all w gas budgeting.
4543 2018-10-09 16:22:21 I just proved it was a lie. Everything I wrote is a historical fact. Are you suggesting that because it isn't front page news then McConnell wasn't lying? Come on, you are better than that. 

I'm still waiting for proof China lifted the tariff on oil. Or was that a lie too?

4553 2018-10-09 16:21:28 yassss...I think an obsession with soap is better, if you run out ypu can't bath, you smell and not so many options for urbanites but oil you can use dovi, munjonjo etc
4554 2018-10-09 16:21:20 Diminishing oil supplies will eventually do that. Surely market forces should determine what is profitable or not.

This will not open up a gateway for me to be like “BUY THIS”, I’m genuinely just curious of peoples’ opinions and thoughts.
4564 2018-10-09 16:20:36 The categorization which takes place in Secretary Clinton's intellectual processing is riddled with holes.

4565 2018-10-09 16:20:29 what i hear from ppl at work and my friends, they can get expensive keeping up with them BUT they love how they look, makeup is easier. for mascara, you’ll have to do something oil free (benefit brand!). ask @getscoutofhere or my friend @MariaNunes4 :)

4574 2018-10-09 16:20:04 @MichaelAvenatti You know I follow you and I believe you are running in 2020. Would you be in favor to stop subsidizing Oil and meat and dairy farmers and start subsidizing Renewable energy and  vegetable farmers?
4575 2018-10-09 16:19:55 @ImAmberHahn Trump Has Done Nothing For The Nation Besides Fill His Masters Pockets,Mans A Joke. Nothing For Education,Medical,Environment, Youth,Mid-age or aging. Speaks On Behalf Of Big Oil That Will Only Mass & Over Produce Mother Earths Resources.
4576 2018-10-09 16:19:52 It is, but I don't know how many choices we have when so much of our economy (and tax base) depends on oil & gas revenue. Even Norway can't just turn off the taps overnight, and they're much further along on this curve.

4582 2018-10-09 16:19:34 Who exactly is buying the oil from this much needed expansion? Name one company....
4583 2018-10-09 16:19:33 They could give it to pro oil industry lobbyists.
4584 2018-10-09 16:19:23 As for LNG, that was done to switch from oil for electricity production.
4585 2018-10-09 16:19:15 modernized country is invested in this endeavor except the US and our withdrawal has everything to do with greed for oil profits.
4586 2018-10-09 16:19:14 Bro I’ve been in this dealership for over an hour waiting on an oil change wtf
4587 2018-10-09 16:19:04 Globe warming storms are coming and will intensify just ask big oil profiting that put Drumpf into power with deals of Russia & fascist overlords!!

4590 2018-10-09 16:18:47 We don't have any safe way to handle and store nuclear waste. We can expect more Fukushimas that ruin our clean water, cities and agriculture if we don't move away from nuclear in addition to coal, gas, oil. Only real plan I think is solar & wind + reduced energy consumption.
4591 2018-10-09 16:18:43 Coconut oil???
4592 2018-10-09 16:18:43 wonder how much oil is still left sludged in the earths core on tht 80s spill

4598 2018-10-09 16:18:26 They gave away all their royalties.  Shutting down the oil industry is urgently needed, but everyone in Alberta, even *Naheed* is pro-oil.  What greasy people Albertans are.
4599 2018-10-09 16:18:19 Oh, I see. It's not careless and greedy oil, coal, and gas companies that help fuel the vast majority of carbon emissions, it's us. Way to go, CNN. Do oil companies pay your asskissing fees or do you do it for free?

4605 2018-10-09 16:17:54 You want a really good reason to lay off fossil fuel? So we don't have to eat out Saudi Arabia's ass every time they want something accomplished. Hell, why not open a program that funnels coal/oil workers into the new industry under the pretense of PURE INDEPENDENCE!
4606 2018-10-09 16:17:46 What the fuck is with this shit where people draw a line through their zeroes? Like the slapdicks who draw a line through their sevens, these people need to be boiled in oil and their fat used to make soap.
4607 2018-10-09 16:17:40 How much oil has been extracted from Scottish waters that's funded Westminster vanity projects that don't benefit Scotland at all in the last 40 years?
Know your history.
4608 2018-10-09 16:17:29 Not really if you automate it on an Excel spreadsheet.
I've built the complete analysis of process leaks frequency and fire/explosion of North Sea oil rigs that way.
Oh, we also used it to draw schematics of oil/gas wells globally.

4610 2018-10-09 16:17:12 They're extracting oil so that you and me can use oil. They're not more evil than you are for using it.
4611 2018-10-09 16:17:04 And baby oil is not vagina lube
4612 2018-10-09 16:17:02 The entire oil policy is to enrich RIL.
4613 2018-10-09 16:17:01 Well, Rog, 80% of the Climate Leadership Plan came from the oil sands CEOs. Are you suggesting that you're also not a fan of the oil sands industry?

4618 2018-10-09 16:16:37 or, Turkey Government announces to Saudi Arabia consolate that suspected 『Putin oil/gas』no smell no color but very poison are said to be in the Consulate somewhere

4625 2018-10-09 16:16:05 We don't use fossil fuels so there is no need to transition away from them. Crude oil is a hydrocarbon that comes from deep within the earth. Do some research instead of being a parrot.

4630 2018-10-09 16:15:43 We love paying 120 for an oil change
4631 2018-10-09 16:15:37 No its easy.  Saudis come up w video or they are out.  NATO doesnt need Saudis shit anymore. The western world is post peak oil, house of Saud is a joke.  Tell em prove it or kick rocks. Whats SA gonna do?
4632 2018-10-09 16:15:37 yes, it makes sense for those who actually care about the environment, like us, because we are willing to wait for that profit to come. But the oil industry won't stand in a corner and risk losing a greater part of their incomes for the "sake of the planet"
4633 2018-10-09 16:15:35 We would safely and humanly and with best environmental practices mine more battery and aluminum resources but could stop strip mining and mt top removaling and fracking fracking and oil spilling?  Was that a trick question?

4637 2018-10-09 16:15:19 I mean, "stabulous". If one HAD to be stabby, wouldn't rainbow/oil slick looking knives be a great option?
4638 2018-10-09 16:15:17 oops, just dropped oil on my shirt
4639 2018-10-09 16:15:06 I can't wait to try this oil!  Is it available to order in Canada?
4640 2018-10-09 16:15:06 One was in charge of oil for two years and never owned a gas station. The other left Customs as a Deputy Director and became a part owner of Nigeria.
4641 2018-10-09 16:15:01 Yam is important, but having oil to eat it is IMPORTANTER
4642 2018-10-09 16:14:59 Still can’t believe my oil changes are $120.

4650 2018-10-09 16:14:04 Factors that cause High Inflation Rate:
1. Oil price in International Market
2. Geopolitical Situation in ME
3. High Local Spending- (Build Build Build), High Employment Rate
4. Less Supply -(Hoarding) Season and calamity
5. Media Hype
6. Politics - (Marcos oust strategy) D/R/IC
4651 2018-10-09 16:14:01 Oh and I have an announcement to make in a video so expect that soon, along with the oil rig timelapse video.
4652 2018-10-09 16:13:58 How is it par? Its about $70 today, and 2013 it was close to $100 per barrel, then fell down dramatically. You also have to take into account added exposure to imported energy, both in quantity of oil needed, and LNG imports which are indexed to crude oil.
4653 2018-10-09 16:13:57 I used olaplex #3 after the bleach before glossing. The bleach I used was Guytang big9. It’s BOMBBBBB!!!!! It has oil in it already. And it didn’t burn my scalp

4663 2018-10-09 16:13:04 Ah that makes sense because I thinned the oil paint with turpentine for the panel lining. Although I did apply a gloss coat on the whole model first. But it's not a big deal, just had to glue some small stuff.

@ZariTheBosslady  must have gotten her idea from that

4685 2018-10-09 16:11:18 But I am, I need to raise the oil prices as much as I can it's what the waifu ships would want
4686 2018-10-09 16:11:14 Actually Wendy’s, Paul’s cooking segments are well documented. He tried, bless his heart, but he took handfuls of soaking wet (!!!) french fries and threw them into a vat of low temp oil.  Have you ever?! 
4687 2018-10-09 16:11:08 Hmm good question... but don't know. Looks like it covers mainly gas fields though, so probably unlikely that it will affect what happens with oil prices?

4691 2018-10-09 16:10:53 So where are the Oil Revenues and  Taxes in Nigeria going? Yet, no good Roads, Electricity, Health Facilities etc.   WHY?   What is the essence of Independence from the Colonial Rulers?
4692 2018-10-09 16:10:52 Let's put this into perspective. 
When you take your car to get an oil change, do you contemplate how the mechanic feels about the probability he has of getting oil in his eye? Or slipping in it? 

FUCK NO YOU DON'T. YOU WANT THAT BOY TO CHANGE YOUR SHIT SO YOU CAN LEAVE.
4693 2018-10-09 16:10:41 Good afternoon "Oil Tot"
4694 2018-10-09 16:10:39 The biggest impact on petrol prices is the weaker NZ dollar. Currency traders are losing confidence in the strength of NZs economy. 
Closing down oil industry without warning, destroying plastics producers without warning & attacking airlines & fuel retailers will make it worse
4695 2018-10-09 16:10:35 I agree with u, rashin kunya like u said can come at u regardless, thats why the mute and block button, but most of the time i dont run away from it, i engage the tweep and possibly school him too. So its still a win for me.

Already checked online to try and find what kind of oil they used because of my allergy
Site says soybean, canola OR corn
Ask cashier what they use at this location
Cashier: "I don't know what we use"
Can you check?
Cashier: "uhhhh... No"

4702 2018-10-09 16:09:59 Mike I agree that we need nuclear, and to change biased mindsets against it.  However i don't see how pitting it against other renewables is helpful (even though the IPCC did).  I suggest to take the high road and argue how much better it is than the oil, coal and gas solutions.
4703 2018-10-09 16:09:55 My CBD oil pen check my snap boo @alexisraeana
4704 2018-10-09 16:09:45 Carbon tax on gas, electricity, heat oil, coal, peat, petrol, diesel.....wheres the alternative for each of the above. Charging carbon tax on the above is the same as shooting fish in a barrel.
4705 2018-10-09 16:09:43 And Trump just puts more gas, oil and coal in the (climate)fire, literally.
4706 2018-10-09 16:09:35 Network monitoring - the snake oil to kill all snake oil...
4707 2018-10-09 16:09:28 The entire 2020 campaign better be about representing all of us and getting rid of Mr. Big Oil/Big Coal and actually doing something to help keep the planet habitable.
4708 2018-10-09 16:09:28 The oil field has protected and cleaned up our Santa Barbara coast from the natural seepage that occurs. Oil is in everything and we need it to sustain our current lifestyle it will keel jobs and has great tax revenue #WhatsYourRebuttal
4709 2018-10-09 16:09:27 Sir, apart fm oil imports, India imports huge sums of mobile phone components, phones, electronic goods which is a huge burden on Forex demand. India missed electronic revolution & we have huge dependency on imports. So it's not financial mgt problem. It's trade deficit issue
4710 2018-10-09 16:09:25 Great to see (via @axios) that @exxonmobil announced that it is financially supporting advocacy efforts for the pricing of carbon emissions.   May other oil and gas companies follow Exxon's lead.
4711 2018-10-09 16:09:11 Who ever speaks of Human Rights and TRUTH to Edomite British Govt that sponsors the continuous GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra for oil and gas. REFERENDUM based on TRUTH.
4712 2018-10-09 16:09:07 For as long as this "UNITARY, EVERYTHING MUST ORIGINATE frm ABUJA" System of GOVT continues NOTHING will CHANGE in the country!
For as long as the Nation continues to depend solely on Oil export, NOTHING wl CHANGE!!
For as long as "I TRUST ONLY my PEOPLE 4 POSITIONS" continues..!

4714 2018-10-09 16:09:00 Ifs, buts and maybe’s. How would the UK have survived the economic slump of the late 60’s, early 70’s without the discovery of North Sea oil, the vast majority from Scottish waters. It was the Thatchers Tories that deregulated the banks in case you’re forgetting.

4716 2018-10-09 16:08:52 Easy answer Nancy: Money. As long as big oil controls politics, money will win out over the future of humanity.

As Big Dan Teague said in O Brother Where Art Thou, "It's all about the money, boys!"
4717 2018-10-09 16:08:51 Stop trying to sell your snake oil! ;)
4718 2018-10-09 16:08:46 I propose a simpler solution: to lower input of carbon into atmosphere, regular oil/gas/coal to progressively reduce production, let market price those progressively rarer commodities.

4809 2018-10-09 15:59:50 Not only that, but think about health insurance for a second, think about doctors, and patients. There are people that really depend on CBD oil to live a normal life and they have to pay entirely out of pocket. The lack of FDA approval for CBD oil as a whole is really bad.

4829 2018-10-09 15:58:06 Listen, the fact that CBD oil in general is not accepted by FDA is a really big deal for CBD oil brands and users. There are a lot of things that we aren't allowed to say, and it even stops us from answering some of our customers most basic inquiries.
4830 2018-10-09 15:57:38 We subsidize oil and gas in this country to the tune of several billion dollars that is why we are falling behind in adopting solar. If less enviro regs means more renewables, wouldn’t trumps dereg help renewable energy? That is not  happening

4859 2018-10-09 15:55:30 Nope, I don't. My electric car doesn't need oil changes. Just one of many benefits.

4861 2018-10-09 15:54:52 Data is non-rival, non-fungible, and has massive network effects.  Data is an incredibly valuable resource but it is not a commodity.  Continued use of atom-based mental models (oil, gold etc) for data inhibit effective discourse on this issue
4862 2018-10-09 15:54:51 So the current Iraqi #Minister of #Oil, Jabbar Luaibi, is the next Director General to the #Iraqi National Oil Company.
4863 2018-10-09 15:54:48 most of the companies on this list are oil/gas/mining companies, so your original point doesn't really apply but
industries like cars and construction materials are the foundation that society is built on because of spending habits, they're not wasteful bc the lizard people (1/)

4865 2018-10-09 15:54:45 Literally 8 of the world's largest oil companies produce more pollution than the entire USA. I'm not saying we shouldn't try to cut down on waste ourselves, because we definitely should, and I do, but we're not the big problem here.

4870 2018-10-09 15:54:34 What do you think about Venezuela not wanting to deal with dollars for their oil?

4874 2018-10-09 15:54:04 Noon had a tough situation ? They might have inherited a tumbling economy but an year later Oil and Gas prices hit rock bottom. The exact opposite is happening right now. The CAD was $2.5 billion/annually in 2013. Today is $2 Billion/month. That explains thebcurrent economy
4875 2018-10-09 15:54:01 It's the #SMSPolloftheDay

There was a massive explosion at the Irving Oil refinery over the weekend. 

Which of the following best describes the incident?
4876 2018-10-09 15:53:56 Of course we care. But we do not like hysteria which forces people to be harmed. Obama would make it so people can not afford to get to their jobs or people being able to have heating oil! Moderation and continued reductions are good.. how about more pressure on China & India!
4877 2018-10-09 15:53:50 Ko?
4878 2018-10-09 15:53:50 You might be drinking unimportant oil. It’s just like essential oil except that it’s optional. Who’s your provider?
4879 2018-10-09 15:53:43 Yes I agree. No palm oil is sustainable and cruelty free. So def non vegan!
4880 2018-10-09 15:53:42 Venezuela's issues has nothing to do with oil. They import too much nd once ur country is under sanctions it will take it's toll on d masse.
4881 2018-10-09 15:53:34 When PMLN was elected they got oil at deferred payments as well. And compared with PPP enjoyed cheaper oil prices.
4882 2018-10-09 15:53:34 Because oil and gas are so muchhhhhh cleaner lol

4885 2018-10-09 15:53:17 Or maybe stop giant cargo ships from burning diesel, or even crude oil without any filters 

Just a thought, maybe those cause more damage than the comparable low numbers of diesel or petrol burned by cars
4886 2018-10-09 15:53:15 Sana nga patuloy na toh, konti na lang yung pag oil ng t-zone ko
4887 2018-10-09 15:53:11 Beware of those who PULL, but never POUR. They are not just after your oil, but your ENERGY
4888 2018-10-09 15:53:09 I just got done doing some seruous maintenance on my car but i still need to do an oil change smh
4889 2018-10-09 15:53:03 Rants are the best.... go listen to ESPN radio if you want some chalk talk. This @Nutless_Monkey probably eats that industrial oil shit.

4891 2018-10-09 15:52:50 A 25% loss to GDP is going to hurt whether your right or left. No deal Brexit forecast at 8-10% of GDP and its pandemonium is some circles.

When sanctions came in, it ceased to matter how much oil was worth - they can't sell it and the exodus followed.
4892 2018-10-09 15:52:49 Thank you for the answer, but that isn't really helpful. The prescription says 1.5g, which doesn't have any correlation to ml of oil. I think you might want to try to provide more useful information to your patients on their prescription.
4893 2018-10-09 15:52:48 More slagging Khabib when he said “god willing” in Arabic. He did not actually slag the Muslim faith or anything like that. Even Conor is not that mental. To be fair to Conor I watched the fight on an oil rig and in three rooms 30 people where streaming the fight around a iPhone

4899 2018-10-09 15:51:59 That feeling when you just finished an oil change and tire rotation and a sleepy Brown Recluse crawls out of the jack you've been using and he's all like "wtf is going on brah"
4900 2018-10-09 15:51:58 The life of the workman is wicked as to the work of hypocrisy with the people who build up the good word to all of us to do many lies so that our lives will not be endangered. The oil fake really good but why not welcome always open the word Xa
4901 2018-10-09 15:51:57 I saw that was an option as well, but I had apple cider vinegar and just ran out of coconut oil.  But, good to know coconut oil works if this doesn't. Thank you, friend!

4903 2018-10-09 15:51:50 In 2011 dollar was selling for 140naira while in 2015 it was trice the rate 370 per dollar. If one barrel of oil was sold for $100 in 2011 that means you earn N14,000 per barrel. At $40 per barrel in 2015 it was N14,400. Do the maths. Who earned more? Stop the blame games.
4904 2018-10-09 15:51:50 have been rubbing so much coconut oil onto my eyes but my lash extensions refuse to budge. ZZZ.
4905 2018-10-09 15:51:47 I accidentally drank CBD oil in a tin at campfire tails
4906 2018-10-09 15:51:32 If we hadn't subsidized the oil industry in the first place,, solar and wind wouldn't need subsides to keep their prices low.  If we paid the true price for oil-based energy in our power bills, other forms of energy would look good by comparison.

4918 2018-10-09 15:50:04 But dont u think oil expressers need to do more to support agricultural productivity in soya farming. how much forex are you guys spending on imports of crude oil? If that money went into soya production, yielding soya for oil, stockfeeds etc, would do wonders for the country
4919 2018-10-09 15:49:52 (´・∀・｀)ﾍｰ
4920 2018-10-09 15:49:50 No?   Proven "not guilty" is not the same as "proven innocent"?   So, it depends on what the definition of "is" is?  What kind of snake oil propaganda is WaPo peddling now?
4921 2018-10-09 15:49:49 ... or anything else, apparently.
4922 2018-10-09 15:49:36 How will US intel know for sure.  They don't have anyone in the embassy. Maybe they can push contacts and get something in the future but pointless making threats against Saudi when the prince knows how vital Saudi is to US interests in regards to Oil, ISIS, Israel & Iran.
4923 2018-10-09 15:49:31 I think it's bullshit that we're not allowed to use CBD oil just because there may be tiny traces of THC 
4924 2018-10-09 15:49:21 And those of us over 60 that remember more! Gas lines because there was no more oil! Enter foreign cars. Then the freeze was coming

4929 2018-10-09 15:49:03 Boy all they asking for is no oil to be used.
4930 2018-10-09 15:49:01 เหมือนกิจกรรมเปิดใจที่ออฟฟิตนี่ใช้ทำเลยอ่ะ
4931 2018-10-09 15:48:57 Don’t be silly. Oil isn’t oil if you say it isn’t. That’s just how these things work. 
4932 2018-10-09 15:48:26 Oil schedule horrendous this month. It would be a miracle if they get one win before the home opener. Not pessimistic but realistic.
4933 2018-10-09 15:48:22 IEA now calling on OPEC spare capacity riding a deficit with Iran sanctions not in yet and marginal barrel 5-7 years out.  Spare capacity is for emergencies not price control.  Chinese also got cute with destocking to mute pricing (they’re new to oil).  Going to get bad.
4934 2018-10-09 15:48:17 You're not paying attention, please try and keep up. Any media information you get out of Venezuela right now is most likely fake news created by their government.
Also, fact check the price of oil today. Surprising how a self-proclaimed fact checker could be so stupid.
4935 2018-10-09 15:48:06 I can tell yal young and dumb and don’t go to the doctor cause that baby oil inside ya crotch?!?!  yea oh kay.....

4937 2018-10-09 15:47:47 Don't tell us you care about the women then sell your soul for dirty oil money from a country that doesn't give a shit about women. Having an all women's PPV doesn't mean equality! The audience is not dumb.
4938 2018-10-09 15:47:43 No!  Da Nang Dick - It wasn’t an American citizen so, we need to stay out of it. 

You and your party have no problem killing US oil and gas jobs which only make us dependent upon the Middle East.  Yet you care about their treatment of journalists......
4939 2018-10-09 15:47:40 Oil prices do impact us and the ‘brotherly’ countries we would like to help us

4942 2018-10-09 15:47:31 This lady on TV just said, “This recipe doesn’t have any butter or oil. It has coconut oil.” But that’s an...oil? 
4943 2018-10-09 15:47:29 Seems like $DXY above 96 area gets sold and oil bid.  The "good" intervention options seem to be eroding.

4965 2018-10-09 15:44:55 Indeed sir - Dont forget people there is a clear agenda to spruik oil up for the spec and to make US look bad for Iran - each time they report accordingly they lose even more credibiity. Great work Sam and @TankerTrackers :)
4966 2018-10-09 15:44:47 In 2013, the global economy was soaring after recovery from the 2008 crisis and the local economy showed potential if not exactly booming. Oil was just $30 a barrel. By every single barometer, the last govt has left the economy manifold worse than it inherited.
4967 2018-10-09 15:44:37 If you’re new to this, I would suggest something like the peach mango oil in the vape pen.

4980 2018-10-09 15:43:48 @SenatorCollins You have taken over $21 million from corporations & oil companies. They give you $ because it’s a return on their investment. But you think when regular Americans donate against you it’s an outrage. You are corrupt & a hypocrite.

4997 2018-10-09 15:42:46 “Our reluctance” is mostly a result of what the market gives us and how those choices are incentivized. These 100 companies aren’t all oil companies, they’re massive conglomerates that control, as I said, a plurality of the economy. A rational actor is all we can be, we react.

4999 2018-10-09 15:42:32 It seems to me that these are not different positions. The memes confirm what is happening from manufacturing to retail. Manufacturers such as puregold oil have not changed their prices. The retailers have. @TamukaKagoro77 visited retailers and saw the evidence he confirms.

5014 2018-10-09 15:41:43 They could never hold it. You don’t win wars by holding cities. You win them by destroying the enemy’s ability to fight. Germany was nowhere close to that in Dec ‘41. Russia moved most of their production facilities east. Still had access to oil, steel, etc.

5044 2018-10-09 15:39:03 Sorry I meant the 2013 economy. You are right about optics and power crisis. My point was that in 2008 there were immense headwinds faced by PPP; PML-N faced tailwinds within six months of coming to power; PTI will face headwinds too as Fed rates and oil prices go up.

Now my pants are off and I don’t want to go back to the store.
5125 2018-10-09 15:31:35 Seeing what Kuwait,Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is selling coconut oil.
5126 2018-10-09 15:31:33 disclaimer i hate oil pastels and dont know how to use them
5127 2018-10-09 15:31:28 It’s not even noon yet and I’ve replaced the starter on my Jeep, changed the oil, and replaced my window regulator that went out a while back. Now it’s time to get to actual work. I’m tired.

5130 2018-10-09 15:31:14 How the hell I need another oil change already, I Just got one 4 weeks ago tho 
5131 2018-10-09 15:30:58 Ya shoving baby oil up your coochies?! Wow god bless
5132 2018-10-09 15:30:54 been vaping now for 12weeks since giving up smoking, am nicotine free. Found a vape oil called black crack. I'm basically vaping Ribenna
5133 2018-10-09 15:30:53 What else does Killington stand for apart from global islamization disguised as liberalism? Any person that can support the terrorist Buhari of Nig to become president is a barbarian and tyrant. That's what Mrs Clinton is. All because of free Biafra oil money.

5134 2018-10-09 15:30:44 Zero carbon future can be a win win solution, but govt must stop pulling the rug from green industries. Clear, supportive, reliable policies are needed plus the removal of oil, gas and nuclear subsidies/promotion. Is this government capable of Siamese twin separation surgery?
5135 2018-10-09 15:30:33 Diezzani with $20 billion missing oil money? 

15 billon dollars missing from arms fund, 10 billion naria, converted to dollars and given as gift to delegates of PDP Nation convention, Bafarawa collected 3 billion for spiritual purposes , 12. 7 billon naria for nepa staff
5136 2018-10-09 15:30:30 Turkey announces that the first oil drill vessel will start its activities in the Mediterranean Sea at the end of October
5137 2018-10-09 15:30:30 Vaping is basically putting candle wax across your lungs. Vapors say that it's just steam. Well, there is no compartment for water to make regular steam, it is a steam made of oil. Those inhaling it are inhaling wax. Bad results coming in 5-10 years.

5141 2018-10-09 15:30:07 And you are too weak to stand up and against the continuous GENOCIDE of Hebrew Biafra by British govt and their jihadists to steal oil and gas.@realDonaldTrump
5142 2018-10-09 15:30:04 Agree but hot contender has to be my beloved frangipani oil ... never without and the memories it evokes... priceless in value x
5143 2018-10-09 15:30:04 If you experience cravings when you smell certain foods, try placing a small amount of peppermint essential oil on your shirt collar
5144 2018-10-09 15:30:00 Meanwhile, our politicians (Canadian at least) continue to be shallow thinkers. Eg. Carbon taxing the public and cancelling certain incentives that would help combat big oil and move key tech like electric cars from the early adopters to the majority.
5145 2018-10-09 15:29:54 Is she really using baby oil? She looking for a yeast infection
5146 2018-10-09 15:29:53 No wonder! All you have to do is look at Kansas and Oklahoma to see what unfettered Republican legislation does.
Oklahoma produces a ton of oil and yet they have a 4 day school week with many schools without books.
Disgraceful!
5147 2018-10-09 15:29:36 Gluten-free, organically grown, spring watered, stone crushed in a village watermill, then handmade with a touch of extra virgin Olive Oil,  as far as shape goes it will be the best-dressed pasta you know the bow type one I think it is called Farfalle :P
5148 2018-10-09 15:29:36 I did Peace Corps training in Ploiesti, Romania, where he bombed the oil fields. It meant that wherever you were stationed afterward was a step up.
5149 2018-10-09 15:29:24 Honestly I don't understand why fossil fuel companies haven't already turned themselves into renewable energy companies? Oil is a finite source - why not fund the transition into our solarpunk future and profit that way?
5150 2018-10-09 15:29:22 Alaaaaa kalau gitu go for cleansing oil but choose the one with "hydrating"
5151 2018-10-09 15:29:20 I swear both military era and PDP era is the main cause of all this calamities we are facing because crude oil will never last sustaining a nations who owns it without using the money they earn to get the nation working
5152 2018-10-09 15:29:07 That's Chicken of the Woods but get it confirmed by an expert before eating. Eat with garlic, oil and and butter and salt them up too because Chicken of the Woods is kind of neutral in taste.
5153 2018-10-09 15:29:06 No it’s not. It’s baby oil.
5154 2018-10-09 15:29:02 5555555 มาค่าขอให้โดนเราา

5156 2018-10-09 15:28:44 AIM? 500 BARRELS OF OIL PER WEEK ?
5157 2018-10-09 15:28:38 Excuse me! How am I saying anything about CPS! OMG, I said that I recently started using CBD oil, and that MJ should be used more. I didn't bash opioids. I live off of them! Thanks for attacking me!
5158 2018-10-09 15:28:35 I think it has something to do with oil. He said he would be talking about "petrol"
5159 2018-10-09 15:28:30 มาเกือบไม่ทัน อีก 2 นาที ~
5160 2018-10-09 15:28:28 Wow, I was over here looking at the olive oil and shit
5161 2018-10-09 15:28:27 Most? All! The oil companies are corporations. Cracking down on them would solve it. And it would be so easy. Just one US president willing to issue an executive order prohibiting one company, say Exxon, from doing business, and all the rest would reduce fossil fuel production.
5162 2018-10-09 15:28:26 I'm done. Very challenging day for me and the way I trade. Oil and gold fought a lot. I didn't trade. I was very close twice but things missed me by a couple ticks. None the less, I'm pleased with the patience I showed. Patience in trading has been hard for me in past years.
5163 2018-10-09 15:28:23 Love putting peppermint oil on my temples and immediately weeping
5164 2018-10-09 15:28:23 The moment I see "environmental champion" nations install scams like solar roads or other similar joke projects I just can't take anyone seriously anymore on this. Fusion power or just embrace the slow decline of humanity when we run out of oil
5165 2018-10-09 15:28:18 It's today clear that British gov't  and her Crown via Nigerian govt embarking on intimidation incarceration and killing of Biafrans for their  (God) Chukwu Olisa Abiama resources  ( oil & gas ), shall both desend into abyss.
5166 2018-10-09 15:28:12 Oh naw you really can’t change your own oil
5167 2018-10-09 15:28:12 HAHAHAHAHA I KNOW RIGHT YOU BETTER DONT EAT TOO MUCH OIL BALLS

5179 2018-10-09 15:26:45 Bad #policy is better than no policy. Policy #uncertainty is creating panic. Much harder times coming. Oil prices to rise, inflation to baloon, policy rate to surge, deficit to widen further. #economy to shrink. Only consistent & clear policy can save. Government must have it.

5189 2018-10-09 15:25:57 What's my point lol. Ok forget housing look at our roads heading for gridlock and we have known this since the 70s & roadbuilders were among the 3 million unemployed also as Oil money rolled in  and I suppose you will tell me there was a traffic jam in Munich last week
5190 2018-10-09 15:25:50 Lol y’all are getting mad over a fictional character. This is the comedy oil I’ve been drilling for! Brenda! Get the contracts ready!
5191 2018-10-09 15:25:50 How about a big announcement about what is happening with climate change?  We have ONE DECADE to fix it or it will be not repairable. Or are the gas an oil donors more important to this administration?
5192 2018-10-09 15:25:48 yeah there not really bad cars. there really cheap to fix and put back on the road. the only issue with the V6 was the intake gaskets and people never check the oil. Got both for the same reason. XD

5199 2018-10-09 15:25:15 The ones who love to throw cerosine oil are very happy
5200 2018-10-09 15:25:12 “ the devil’s lettuce”, that saying couldn’t be futher from the truth...I believe in the book - the emperor wear’s no clothes, they have excerpts from the Bible which clearly are the work of the cannabis plant. They don’t realize but that miracle oil in their bible is weed.
5201 2018-10-09 15:25:05 Big oil - provides activities to produce natural gas.  Which goes into centralized generation facilities.  Which creates electricity.  To power electric cars.
5202 2018-10-09 15:24:55 Dating a Married Man is not the problem until you see your name saved as engine oil.
5203 2018-10-09 15:24:46 Saudi Arabia,Qatar,Dubai, no generate reach this and see how great the economy is,  no wonder American government love Nigeria, they don't want us to own any refineries to dey refine our crude oil so that we can keep exporting our crude oil to their nation
5204 2018-10-09 15:24:44 ไม่งง คนรีเยอะอ่ะเขียด สั่งพี่มาร์คให้เก็บแพ้บ 5555555555
5205 2018-10-09 15:24:36 agree there - both current account and financial flows seem close to balance these days (with oil ~ $80) so long as there isn't any momentum in the CNY  (movement begats movement) that is generating capital flow pressure.  that's a big change from the past.

5210 2018-10-09 15:24:14 So... we leave our oil in the ground then destroy the planet by hauling it to Canada in polluting barges rather than shipping it in pollution-free pipelines? That. Makes. Sense. #LiberalHypocrisy

5214 2018-10-09 15:23:44 At heart of so many matters is control. Whether it’s sea ports, air bases, oil, strategic position.
These countries in general have a culture that cannot be molded into something that reflects us, then assuming it’s best for them.  They are tribal.
5215 2018-10-09 15:23:31 Aunty, maybe try some lavender oil on his bed. It’s supposed to be very soothing. Did you try the collar charm we sent? We broke ours! 3 each 
5216 2018-10-09 15:23:31 Working in the oil field you never know what’s next 
5217 2018-10-09 15:23:24 I can't begin to imagine how much money from national oil interests is funding this county-wide initiative. The text states "Existing petroleum extraction establishments MAY CONTINUE." Effort should be directed into removing the disincentives to solar power generation.

5233 2018-10-09 15:21:41 He made a few comments disagreeing with Trump, but he always votes exactly how Trump tells him to vote. At home, he avoids constituents who are opposed to Trump & has been investigated for financial crimes. Oil.

5244 2018-10-09 15:20:58 Who even listens to this liar and gaslighter anymore?  I turn him off every time he shows up on TV.  I want to spend my time supporting candidates who are worthy of office and taking my attention off this snake oil salesman.

5251 2018-10-09 15:20:38 I’m loving it so far. I’ve had consistent anxiety for a few years, done therapy/meditation/etc and never tried prescription meds so can’t speak to that but the oil is doing more to combat the physical feelings that anything I’ve tried so far. Huge relief
5252 2018-10-09 15:20:23 90% of Atiku's fortune came from the East. He made so much money as comptroller of Custom & Igbos are the major importers of goods. He owns an oil WELL which is also located in the Eastern region. He will use our money to buy the votes of the gullible ones not me. Im done wit Nig

5256 2018-10-09 15:19:47 One thing you won't get out of any media coming out of Venezuela right now is facts. We have spoken directly to the Venezuelan community in Calgary, many of whom still have family there.
But go ahead fact checker, tell me again how you think it's the price of oil? lol
5257 2018-10-09 15:19:44 I think the goal is not to burn anything. Hemp has it’s uses and when used in construction the CO2 that is captured is not released back into the atmosphere. Better than oil and coal yes but not an end goal.

5266 2018-10-09 15:18:52 The GOP has gone so far right it sucked the Democrats along. This is oil companies and billionaires at work. Greed. 

Bernie Sanders? Pre Reagan America. I was there, I saw it. Students loans in 1979 killed free colleges and drove up tuition.
5267 2018-10-09 15:18:46 The oil can be reduced depending on who cooks it
5268 2018-10-09 15:18:45 Oh yes i forgot we cant blame socialism. It becomes authoritarianism when it fails doesnt it. It accounted for 50% of exports. The oul priced dipped 50% but has on the main picked up greatly to over $80 simply blaming oil isnt the answer
5269 2018-10-09 15:18:43 Whatever, but the collapse of War over oil is more important.

And some crackheads are telling you of incompetence

5299 2018-10-09 15:16:13 You obviously haven’t been to Alberta lately. The home of the oil sands. We have had more snow since September than you have most likely seen in any September in your entire life. Warming by 1.5 degrees I would argue that.
5300 2018-10-09 15:16:11 I really had to wake up at 9:30 to take my car to get an oil change 

I’m not having a good time.
5301 2018-10-09 15:16:10 We need to fix the climate first by GETTING OFF OF OIL!  Only 12 more years before climate change effects are irreversible.

5309 2018-10-09 15:15:35 I doubt this change will ever happen.. it is due to a high oil concentration so unless they change their recipe it probably isnt possible. And also why change the method of what already sells?
5310 2018-10-09 15:15:33 Stop using palm oil in your products. You’re killing an entire species. Orangutans have less than 10 years left unless the snack industry stops using palm oil. Palm oil is bad to eat. It’s used because it’s cheap. SHAME ON YOU AND THE SNACK INDUSTRY.

5317 2018-10-09 15:15:16 I don't believe in prison, much less capital punishment, but any and all oil executives should be publicly executed
5318 2018-10-09 15:15:08 Yup it's just socialism not the fact that it has a lot of oil, and the U.S. is undermining it.

5333 2018-10-09 15:14:00 So what's going on? Does it have anything to do with purchasing oil? Or just pure market speculation? (I'm honestly lost on USD & EUR dynamics ever since 2016...)
5334 2018-10-09 15:14:00 My larger point being: oil hasn't been a subject of international wars for hundreds of years. It's a phenomenon unique to industrial civs capable of harnessing oil.
5335 2018-10-09 15:13:59 Supply concerns are well reflected in prices and Iranian oil exports won’t be zero. China and India will remain buyers. And demand is leveling off both in the US and Europe while it’s under pressure in most emerging markets due to fuel inflation.
5336 2018-10-09 15:13:58 There's so much ignorance surrounding us and so much carelessness.
The fact that each and everyone of us don't do its part, frustrates whatever real effort the few make. Of course there's no promoting sustainable energy because oil lobbies rule it all,when some countries like+

5356 2018-10-09 15:12:07 @CBSThisMorning Coal and oil are identical but one has more water.  It is the extensive use of fossil fuels that produces more carbon than we have forests to absorb,  Looking to hurt US energy & freeze US assets.  Places & people without environments. Replace them.
5357 2018-10-09 15:12:07 Lyons sent a letter asking for money and pledging to protect oil and gas contracts.
5358 2018-10-09 15:12:04 So; who will stop using gas and coal first. There are a multitude of alternative energy sources to power every aspect of our technological life. Gov’ts have not changed their oil usage due to under the table deals that benefit only their pockets.

5374 2018-10-09 15:10:58 The 1850s are when we started chasing it down and commercializing it for sure, but it didn't become a geopolitical black hole until until the late 1800s/early 1900s when we started to discover the range of functions (and range of deposits) oil has.

5396 2018-10-09 15:09:30 In some, more visionary, jurisdictions they may not yet be as economical as old technology, but the initial goal is to reduce emmisions. With the huge amounts of money spent to keep promoting oil in America, it will stagnate.
5397 2018-10-09 15:09:23 You've got a short memory. 1,200 people killed in Spain in May 1981 after being poisoned by tainted cooking oil. Benzene-tainted Perrier. Dioxin contaminated chicken.

5530 2018-10-09 14:58:29 Previous owner I assume, I bought her a few months ago and haven’t done anything but change the oil, and the chain. In the last few rides, I’ve been smelling unburnt fuel when stationary
5531 2018-10-09 14:58:23 You’d sound like a snake oil salesmen...... try “ hello. I am an angel of the lord, I have your son from a different universe... this other universe was radically different, and he will need extra care” then list several things you know about him.....

It's almost as if the spivs, snake oil salesmen & pantomime toffs are dishonestly persuading workers to surrender their hard-won rights and protections...

Meanwhile, Trump already had ...

- money
- beautiful women
- fame

So Putin had NOTHING to offer Trump.

5701 2018-10-09 14:42:34 She’s likely concerned about your oil supply.   She’s @GOP and Trump apologist, after all.

5767 2018-10-09 14:36:37 There's routinely a statistical overstatement based on fear. In the 70's there were people claiming the world would be out of oil by 1990.  We of course impact our environment, but we overstate our importance.

5787 2018-10-09 14:34:56 Gas prices are high because we are importing oil and taxing it to death instead of producing it at home
5788 2018-10-09 14:34:52 Qatar is wealthy only because Western civilization made the Industrial Revolution and decide to use their oil as a main source of energy. When they’ll give up it as they gave up coal to use oil in the past, Qatar will no longer be wealthy.
5789 2018-10-09 14:34:52 Our intervention in the Middle East is what caused a lot of the problems. Natural resources like lithium and oil are the motivations for the need to have military presence and control.

5833 2018-10-09 14:31:29 Venezuela lost a massive chunk of their GDP when oil prices fell. Then followed political issues (authoritarianism). Then followed sanctions (April I think), where GDP collapsed.

Long story but grasping at straws to say this is down to socialist economics policy.
5834 2018-10-09 14:31:23 I did the same thing last week.  I was getting an oil change at the car shop.  Trump came on.  After a few minutes of his bullshit, I asked an employee, in an agitated state, to shut the damned TV off.  He took one look at who was on & complied.  He agreed.  This is in Texas.

5840 2018-10-09 14:30:51 I think that's an excellent contrarian question. I think we are close or at the bottom. Can't see any other way around it other than liberalizing (unless crude oil rallies strongly, which counterintuitively would be bad news = more leeway for Maduro)

Me: ...I guess I’ll add oil?

(Adds oil)

Me: wow I’m so accomplished, im such a freakin adult, yay responsibility 

Also me: eww my hands are dirty af now
5961 2018-10-09 14:19:32 This same tactic is used in the oilfield. When drilling leases near maturity, oil companies will "spud in" a hole. Which is just a hole drilled to a certain depth in order to hold or extend the lease. Depending on financing and market, the spud hole may or may not be completed.
5962 2018-10-09 14:19:29 I've heard fr people in seats that would put them in a position to know that CNY has been effectively pegged to gold since...(wait for it)... shortly after the launch of the CNY oil contract in late March.  Potentially critical implications going forward don't you think?
5963 2018-10-09 14:19:29 Government "intent" is a squishy thing. Will any elected petro state take away the voters' petrol? Or will it just lower prices and cause more consumption? If u want to dismantle the petro industry, then ban their product.  Big plus: no compensation to oil co's (Mugler v Kansas)

5996 2018-10-09 14:16:27 Agreed. Govt is harassing Vijay Malya with all kinds of investigations when he wanted to return to settle bank dues. Why govt is wasting precious resources on Malya who operated Kingfisher airlines despite crude oil crossed $ 100 per barrel. He may have diverted  some funds

6004 2018-10-09 14:15:56 I was so fucked up and bored that I got up, took my car to the pump, got fuel and oil/ lubricants, came back home; washed the car thoroughly & polished it, waxed the tires, vacuumed the carpets and also cleaned the interior with the wax.
Now back to my corner. Cheers.
6005 2018-10-09 14:15:54 Very simple....they have been in schools abroad, No damning report on any of them. PMB was a former HOS, petroleum minister etc and he didn't allocate oil blocs to himself like Atiku and others. No foreign accounts traceable to him. Can you live above that when entrusted..?

6023 2018-10-09 14:14:38 Incorrect.  It beats it every day.  Wells uses wildlife killing palm oil, while Ben and Jerry’s doesn’t.  But, that would require thinking of someone or something other than yourself, so I can see where you’d get confused.

6085 2018-10-09 14:09:50 That's interesting. But I'm also reading that the compromise (potentially) would strip EPA of its ability to regulate GHG. Sounds like not only no Clean Power Plan, but no future attempt at a Clean Power Plan. Not sure how this breaks down, but seems like a massive win for oil
6086 2018-10-09 14:09:49 If talking to me I am not trolling and serious.   The attack on Tesla is for the benefit of legacy energy companies. Oil owns the GOP and the main stream media.  If that is not obvious to u do more thinking.

6099 2018-10-09 14:09:10 I was about 10,000 miles past when I needed an oil change so if anyone wants to know why my car breaks all the time it’s cuz I’m a dumbass
6100 2018-10-09 14:09:05 Does avo have oil?
6101 2018-10-09 14:09:03 Damn. Not at oil? Not even a little bat?
6102 2018-10-09 14:09:01 I think you are worried more about the leaves than the bolls?  If the cotton wasn't stunted because of drought like some of my irrigated was this summer I used 48 oz Prep, 1 oz of Sharpen, 1/2 rate of AMS and Crop Oil.  Worked good on non stunted cotton.

6113 2018-10-09 14:07:53 It isn't the climate plan that needs to be changed. It's the public's fiscal literacy. If we crack down on tax haven't, demand and end to fraud and oil subsidies, we can stop the money feeding the problem. We need to demand tax justice for climate justice.

6124 2018-10-09 14:06:59 Trump continues to try and bribe voters especially farmers to placate them through his trade war with China. Now trying to increase ethanol in gas to appease corn farmers, but big oil not too happy with that and vowed to fight him in court.

6128 2018-10-09 14:06:34 One of the worst things I've ever done was put salt on a slug. I'd heard it was a good way to get rid of them, but never did it. Then I did, and have never forgotten how awful it was. It's been a long time, and I still cringe thinking about it.
6129 2018-10-09 14:06:24 Where ONGC couldn’t find oil in Rajasthan, Cairn could do it. So ONGC replacement of GSPC is not improper
6130 2018-10-09 14:06:23 Maybe your hair is naturally soft. Most guys have to put oil daily and comb it too. Others just wash and comb it and it's looking good. Lol...

6134 2018-10-09 14:06:12 Go to Oloibiri, the small town where Nigeria discovered oil in large commercial quantity. You can't even live there.

Someday these fraudulent entities will pay for their sins.
6135 2018-10-09 14:06:07 Do you realize that the use of petro-chemicals saved the whales from extinction? Switching from whale oil to earth oil allowed for regulation to stop killing whales. People want to keep warm when it's cold and burn stuff to do it.
6136 2018-10-09 14:06:07 RT:( @JimCramer): Housing punches above its weight.. .autos could be terrible. The consumer will soon get sticker shock. Oil's high price is hurting the economy. I do not dismiss @steveliesman 's work. But honestly that view of my work is really unfair #bloomberg #wsj #article …
6137 2018-10-09 14:06:03 Wait, did u put more oil in ur car?
6138 2018-10-09 14:05:49 What an appropriate comment given Lord Monckton was accused of the same thing.  He claimed to have created a cure for cancer, the flu and other diseases.  We’re still waiting for this magic pill ... but we know it’s snake oil.

You do realize that channels and videos like that are paid for by oil companies, right? 

Research the Paris agreement.
6142 2018-10-09 14:05:10 Why do my parents ask mad questions everytime i cook.. What oil are you using? Did you use the microwave? How much water did you put in the pot? I think thats cooked enough. Why don’t you add... bruh shut uuuuuuup

6159 2018-10-09 14:03:39 One way you could build trust is by allowing students to design their curriculum. The corporate model of administrators, like CEOs, that represent without leading, tenured professors, professors, TAs, and various layers of students, is vulnerable to oil company influence.

6165 2018-10-09 14:02:49 I hear exciting things about cbt oil. I can’t afford it anyway so it’s academic, but I keep hearing that it helps people. I wish it was available on the nhs because no painkiller they have offered me does anything.

6169 2018-10-09 14:02:36 But how clever if he can remove a thorn from his  side, and pin it on his enemies, who he can then purge, with the best wishes of the west as being a progressive leader. All the while  radicalizing the Baloochs - better start selling more oil though.
6170 2018-10-09 14:02:27 Most of us can't do that as you know. But we can still advocate for reductions and freeze new expansion while we figure out how to replace oil based products with alternatives...
6171 2018-10-09 14:02:25 Scrap the crude oil pipeline and build a refinery in Alberta. Independence for Canada.

6174 2018-10-09 14:02:19 Those are the requirements of joining the Rand System, you become more or less a province of SA. It was best if Gaddaffi's idea of a African currency backed by oil that would have worked better 4 us, the Euro zone situation.

6178 2018-10-09 14:01:52 1) Do weapons manufacturer's make weapons for free? No. When they get used, they get replaced by the taxpayer. And then there's oil contracts & reconstruction funds: I suggest you google 'iraq/afghanistan missing billions.' Or perhaps the Pentagon's missing trillions.
6179 2018-10-09 14:01:50 There were several global floods and ice age cycles before the last one. Many species became extinct. Only the fittest, cleverest and luckiest survived. Coal and crude oil came from dead trees & animals wiped out in these events. Nature protects Earth from over population.

6189 2018-10-09 14:01:04 Your view sounds like you are saying "Why do people invest in oil, it is only used to lubricate engines" missing the bigger use that it is used as a fuel in the engine in order to provide motive power.

6194 2018-10-09 14:01:02 My second cupping experience also gets two thumbs up! I’m in desperate pursuit of permanent relief!  Injections have proved ineffective.  Several of you have mentioned CBD oil.  

Tell me more!
6195 2018-10-09 14:00:59 Yes, it can work for head hair. Beard oil is a conditioning agent for skin and facial hair so one could use it to keep their hair conditioned if they wanted to. As we like to say, "beards are hair too."

6230 2018-10-09 13:57:58 @Spencers_Retail Damaged oil pouch. Leaked into sugar. Despite calling up customer care, no replacement of sugar or oil. Order no 189709 invoice no 158163. @jagograhakjago pls take note
6231 2018-10-09 13:57:56 The best thing about a possible environmental apocalypse coming sooner rather than later is a lot of people now working in the oil industry will be around to see it.
6232 2018-10-09 13:57:55 It was even said at the time the real reason for war was oil - its hardly a conspiracy

6236 2018-10-09 13:57:31 There’s also a touching story behind those noodles- a person got taught by a monk to make noodles without the use of oil for his father who had a weak stomach. So these noodles are made from just wheat and salt. The name of the noodle bears the meaning of warmth or kindness.

6250 2018-10-09 13:56:07 It’s way better. It has different speed settings from slow to extremely fast, and one side of it is a cleaning brush for your face and the other side is meant for like messaging oils (like rose oil) in your skin although you don’t have to follow that if you don’t want to.
6251 2018-10-09 13:55:33 Respectfully disagree. Manning changed the sports culture in Indiana. He made football cool in a basketball state. His real statue is Lucas Oil; not the one of his likeness out front. Neither Brees nor Brady, while both great, can make that claim.

6254 2018-10-09 13:55:12 d) Even importing finished goods had same effect. We imported salt, cooking oil etc, and Zimbabweans freed up more of their income to employ bakers, building contractors, buy cars, etc.

6256 2018-10-09 13:55:08 I prefer realist. I get your point but right now, if govt went full environment they would be gone. Wealthy folks, oil people would make sure.
Then Cons would be in power and would be headed backwards.
6257 2018-10-09 13:55:07 The next couple of winters are going to be brutal. People will wonder why they listened to the global warming nutjobs for so long. The prices of oil and gas are going to go through the roof. It didn't have to be that way, they could have prepared for what they knew was coming.

6260 2018-10-09 13:54:52 Gee, a standing ovation from the oil & gas industry.  What a surprise!  You always support big oil, anything else you say is just empty words.  Don't expect an ovation from the average citizen in your district.  #NOPearce4NM

6272 2018-10-09 13:53:32 I remember when I was in high school during the 90's; they said by 2010 we'd be out of oil, all the rain forests would be gone and whales and elephants would be extinct. But the libtards also said Hillary would win in 2016...
6273 2018-10-09 13:53:29 We should stop relations with this land. Bomb it and take back the oil that we, the Westerners, have exploited thanks our smart brains. These tribes have the brains of camels and goats.

Taht old woman is dying, there's better way to show care.

6277 2018-10-09 13:53:24 I guess because massive oil companies are all involved in denial of climate change because they don't want to lose business and are too lazy and cheap to just invest in renewable energy.

6284 2018-10-09 13:52:31 #Iran plans to issue coupons to eleven million of its poorest people to help ease their hardship as new #US sanctions undermine the economy. The electronic cards would be used to buy staples  - including rice, meat and cooking oil.
6285 2018-10-09 13:52:30 1 - who is the one that still keep making new stuff for humanity ? who are the people that helped finding the oil ? who are the people that still making new medic and pills and never gave up?

6292 2018-10-09 13:51:48 Under a fiver, I wouldn't complain. Absolutely spot on truffle oil does make a difference.
6293 2018-10-09 13:51:44 Disagree. Iraqi shiites amenable to Iran cannot be permitted to become a proxy conduit for Iranian oil. That would destroy the sanctions
6294 2018-10-09 13:51:43 It boggles my mind (okay that's a lie, no it doesn't) that these big oil companies did all this research decades ago and knew exactly where fossil fuels were taking us, yet didn't use that knowledge to easily pivot into being the dominant players of the renewable energy industry.

6298 2018-10-09 13:51:34 I don't support Kurdish separatism because I see Kurdish militias as functioning as a proxy force for Israeli interests, in efforts to balkanize Syria, & steal Iraqi oil, which plays into steps towards war with Iran/Israeli expansionism.

6302 2018-10-09 13:51:17 Agree with 1) and 3) but there is no reason to think 2) works -- state owned oil companies pump and sell the stuff just as fast as privately owned oil companies. Look at Norway, Russia, Saudis, Venezuela. If you want to #keepitintheground then ban it.

6311 2018-10-09 13:51:01 Essence of peppermint or peppermint oil (for baking/candy) is a good deterrent. The houses/hotels are good to get the bulk removed rather than just setting a border. Awesome/Lysol or diluted bleach in a spray bottle is a good group kill.

6315 2018-10-09 13:50:34 Actually, quite often they *are* told that. We need to unite & reconcile. Everybody lets their emotions out occasionally. I thought he did OK & poured oil on the waters.  Old FidoNet saying: "Do not be excessively annoying, & do not be too easily annoyed."

6317 2018-10-09 13:50:21 I'd think that the coalition of megacorporations, both in media & in oil, encouraging idiots to blame Marxists & Communists when scientists speak out about climate change SHOULD be ALL the info an adult needs to figure out who is lying & who is not. Evidently, adults are uncommon
6318 2018-10-09 13:50:09 We’ll happily go and take our electricity, oil, fishing revenue, whisky & gin revenue, financial services, water and tax revenues with us ... we’ll give you a wave when you suddenly realise how much England needs our resources to survive ...
6319 2018-10-09 13:50:08 France will be fine with Iran as long as Iran doesn't interrupt the flow of oil to France. If that happens then France will call to invade Iran and implement regime change.

I kid. Or. Maybe not.
6320 2018-10-09 13:50:06 I do know how to do oil changes. I didn’t know you could do rotations yourself.
6321 2018-10-09 13:50:03 Indeed, there are only Jewish Palestinians. Palestine was an area taken from the Jewish people, renamed and then given back, or so they claim. Its not true, as proven, 80 % of Israel was stolen by the British and given to the Hashemite Kingdom for control of our oil.

6326 2018-10-09 13:49:45 It boggles my mind that people think pro-Climate change reduction is anti-capitalism. I have a friend with a renewable energy related start up that is making bank. We can easily reduce/stop use of coal, oil, natural gas without destroying capitalism.

Also don’t forget you also looted to create the mess in Harare. Lets not forget !
6334 2018-10-09 13:48:50 US refiners pay almost US$75 per barrel for oil from Texas, the Gulf Coast, or North Dakota, or for imported high-quality crude. But they pay less than US$30 for a barrel of Alberta bitumen.

“Coal must be used increasingly as an alternative to scarce, expensive or insecure oil and gas supplies” (#potus38, Gerald Ford, 1976)

6358 2018-10-09 13:47:26 I'm guessing far less than half, and the remainder wouldn't be dumb, but it takes an incredible network of knowledge to even make a  pencil, let alone produce gasoline or oil needed to feed even 10% of world if that many were left.
6359 2018-10-09 13:47:25 I guess what Jeremy Hunt means by "shared values" is the value to share holders of lucrative arms deals and oil drilling and exploration rights.

6378 2018-10-09 13:45:23 it looks like the series b holders gave up some of the economics.  i wish $AR had updated their FCF estimates using current strip pricing for NG and oil/liquids.
6379 2018-10-09 13:45:20 Here's an idea. Detach yourself from all fossil fuels and all related oil based products...then attempt to live without them. No ones stopping you.
6380 2018-10-09 13:45:19 As the EPA meets in Wash DC to discuss oil field produced water management policy the Texas Alliance is there —-  “The Texas Alliance of Energy Producers  recognizes the best place to regulate oil field produced  water is at the state level. “

6385 2018-10-09 13:45:01 Where would the world be w/o the discovery of oil?
I am certain sometime in the near future technology will move to another reliable energy source.
What I see POLITICANS doing is hedging to release today's unreliable energy sources in an attempt to extort $$$ from the oil comp.

6420 2018-10-09 13:41:58 They’re just pissed because they think we’re gonna pay $4 a gallon for gas. The only reason they do that in Cali is because they don’t have any oil. WE HAVE PLENTY.

Yep, oil, coal, and natural gas will take a huge hit, but I have to imagine building all of the new infrastructure would employ the same number of people or more.
6432 2018-10-09 13:41:24 No, that's the very narrative a complicit liberal media want us to buy. Much virtuous greenwash and reminders here of 'individual responsibility' from Guardian, BBC and Big Oil itself. But complete media blindness to corporate capitalism as the key force driving climate calamity.

6473 2018-10-09 13:37:45 California, the gas tax is to pay for our roads. Which you use. With the gas. So yes, we pay a tax for it. Alternatively you could ask Big Oil why they’ve cock blocked electric cars?

6480 2018-10-09 13:37:11 the impact of rising oil prices is much more intense on the PHL than other countries. also the strong depreciation of the peso, something that is not happening in other countries is increasing oil prices much more than in other countries.

6510 2018-10-09 13:34:01 Why are the growth in GDPs for the L.I.Cs higher than for oil exporters and M.I.Cs (except  Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal? Could it be because they (South Africa, Zambia & oil exporters) rely primarily on export of  minerals?

Financial case predicated on Oil revenue in '15 >$90 per barrel, however SNP said would rise to $120> today it is $67 per barrel 
Also, told Scotland remain in EU but it wouldn't as EU confirmed

Just pointing out the facts, no axe to grind!

6523 2018-10-09 13:32:25 People who spent the last five weeks believing conspiracy theories about high schoolers we running gang rape rings in the 1980’s want you to completely send the oil markets into free fall because of a black van and boxes. 

6524 2018-10-09 13:32:17 Oil and gas licensing in Lebanon has been fairly transparent so far. Will this spread to other services/activities under the Ministry of Energy and Water @CesarAbiKhalil? No valid reasons why the Ministry doesn’t communicate more on FSRUs tender or publish related info/documents.

6531 2018-10-09 13:31:38 Many companies have experience with oil, we pick one that doesn't. Same thing is happening with platinum deposits in the Great Dyke, happened with diamonds in Chiadzwa, how did all that go?

6535 2018-10-09 13:30:47 Why doesn't the people who complain about Climate Change all stop using cars, coal electricity, oil/gas, and plastics? If they really believed in what they were saying, then they would. But they are just using that scare to amass more power and wealth.
6536 2018-10-09 13:30:36 Boleh faham je rasa affected staff mmc gamuda ni sekarang because i once had the same feeling when the oil price drop back in 2015/2016 and the company decided to reshuffle our department. Risau kot!

6544 2018-10-09 13:29:52 We can hope! But I'm not holding my breath. The mainstream media bows & scrapes to its oil & auto industry advertisers & their crony corporate bosses. They report any @Tesla fire or wreck, but ignore reports on their superb safety testing results & sales figures. @elonmusk
6545 2018-10-09 13:29:47 You do realize that this will raise oil prices, right?
6546 2018-10-09 13:29:46 hi hurt, you are more than a baby oil to me :>
6547 2018-10-09 13:29:41 In my philosophy class, we were just talking about what makes something art, what gives it value. It's interesting to think about it in context of wealth as opposed to quality. I've never realized just how prevalent this image of wealth was in oil paintings.
6548 2018-10-09 13:29:32 "stopping warming at 1.5C would involve an immediate, coordinated crash program of re-industrialization"

I'm all for using solar, wind, etc. alongside oil and coal until better ideas come along, but just dropping oil and coal immediately would be devastating to living standards.

6553 2018-10-09 13:29:04 People that manage or are in industries that bring in trillions of dollars yearly: oil and weapons to name a few. And if we know that on those trillions of dollars there are taxes that government treasuries are also not that glad Tesla comes to ruin the game of all of them. 
6554 2018-10-09 13:29:04 Im going to order the rose hop oil right now!!
6555 2018-10-09 13:28:59 HA! Have you read the latest UN report on climate change? A huge problem & none of the answers include oil rigs off Florida’s coast! In fact, we have 11 years - 11 years!!! - to limit a climate change catastrophe. It’s time to convert fossil fuel energy to renewable green energy.
6556 2018-10-09 13:28:58 You know you're an adult (or boring) when the only answers to "What do you want for your birthday?" are:

** Well my tags are about to expire
** My oil change is coming up
** You can get my car fully detailed
** I don't know.. nothing

20 yrs ago I'd have a long wishlist.. *sigh*
6557 2018-10-09 13:28:42 Make sure you have enough oil( character) in your lamp before the groom comes, prepare for the coming of the groom.
6558 2018-10-09 13:28:41 @itsbl0ndie have you tried the IT cosmetics matte CC cream in the cream tube? I love the regular but I become an oil slick by lunch.
6559 2018-10-09 13:28:40 So true!  Some of my favorite non-food uses is putting cayenne powder in bird feeders and making a pepper/garlic oil to spray in the veg garden. Lets me get some revenge on those crafty squirrels!

6562 2018-10-09 13:28:31 Yip seen it being done oil is less effective than desiel fuel because desiel eats into the tar and every time it rains some residue comes to the surface and causes that patch to become very similar to an ice rink. Towing companies made a fortune from it.

6573 2018-10-09 13:27:39 hey bronlies, jensen said "destiel doesn't exist" one time over 1 year ago. and in that time, jensen asked people to write oil rig fanfic and said that dean and cas eye f u c k. that quote is completely irrelevant now.
6574 2018-10-09 13:27:34 “... Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD forever.”

6580 2018-10-09 13:26:37 I happened to mention that my mother always wore rose oil based perfumes. 
The sweetest thing that someone just gifted me everything Rose oils.

6589 2018-10-09 13:25:16 I know! I don’t care where I live. I’m not about to take or leave my children anywhere where they can legally be taken away and separated from me.
6590 2018-10-09 13:25:11 Really? I'm not with him on this one. Ethanol was a dumb idea even before we were swimming in US produced oil and natural gas and it's even more dumb now. It costs more than it saves while driving up food costs. I like most of what @realDonaldTrump is doing, but not this.
6591 2018-10-09 13:25:08 I don't feel like getting this oil change 
6592 2018-10-09 13:25:02 It is widely known that positive or good news "don't sell", so it's better to ignore them or at least try to numb them as much as possible. What the "free press" (if any) doesn't know is that "you can't cover the sun with one finger"! Oil industry is doomed!
6593 2018-10-09 13:25:00 "Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

6620 2018-10-09 13:22:51 Keep in in the ground. 

Invest in solar and wind, not oil rigs: cheaper to build, quicker ROI, gives known returns for 40 years. Oh, and improves human health, defunds oil dictators, gives true US energy independence, and, well, keeps the planet habitable.
6621 2018-10-09 13:22:38 Thanks bunches for your service and sacrifice!  Mix bio oil and lotion together, that is what I do for my son, it helps with the dryness.
6622 2018-10-09 13:22:30 Yeah but oil companies will never admit that. Even when they know they are killing us and the planet for money.
6623 2018-10-09 13:22:17 How to apply:
make sure you wash your eyelashes and eyebrows to clean them from makeup or other products then with a cotton swab apply the oil on the roots of the hair and massage the eyelid area and the area near the lashes.

Iraq I was a righteous ‘war’ to free Kawait and prevent Iraq from taking its oil. 

Iraq II was needless, worthless and wrong.

6643 2018-10-09 13:20:50 What exactly has this government gotten us except abject poverty amidst insane borrowing with no infrastructure to show for it? Obj met oil at $9 and yet he paid off our debt and left $60b. Wage debt has Buhari paid, how many people has he taken out of poverty? Please tell us

6645 2018-10-09 13:20:45 The Shea moisture black castor oil shampoo is my second favourite shampoo to use.
6646 2018-10-09 13:20:33 Rub it on your legs after you shave, use it as oil to cook with, replacement for butter on food products, use it as face moisturizer (also removes make up and reduces wrinkles) wash off after 5 min.  Add a little bit to your hair conditioner to add some extra moisture.
6647 2018-10-09 13:20:30 Grabbed meself some remedies: an anti-fever socket drink just in case, some nosedrops with eucalyptus and pine oil (man that shit is STRONK) and a grapefruit Schweppes. Here's a lifehack: consume everything citrus and drink coffee, vitamin C & caffeine are base of most cold meds.
6648 2018-10-09 13:20:21 I've been in business 23 years ( I'm not really old lol) and here in scotland when the oil was really big I was was waiting 120day to get paid.i now no longer service that market
6649 2018-10-09 13:20:18 There lies the problem, a tax levied on a business filters down to the consumer This is why most Oil and Gas companies are on board, would you rather make 30% GM on $1 or $1.30 at then end of the day it is the middle class that is being punished for driving to work

6651 2018-10-09 13:20:16 @pepboysauto Serious question- What’s the point in making an 8am appointment if my oil change is going to take 30 min to an hour?
6652 2018-10-09 13:20:08 Abacha who tried it was put to shame, mind you, this man has served as Minister for Petroleum, Head of State and as PTF chairman, he has no oil bloc or license. If we, masses don't see anything good in this man, then we are blind.

6654 2018-10-09 13:19:58 Last night, I dreamt that I could buy a $900 oil painting without batting an eyelash. This morning, I wake up to a car with no heated seats. Probably top 5 worst disappointments to wake up to.

6672 2018-10-09 13:18:39 Corporations have a big vested interest in all this "no plastic straws" type small-scale action because it curbs activist energy away from real solutions like imposing a 100% carbon tax, tearing down institutions of corporate power, guillotining oil barons, etc.
6673 2018-10-09 13:18:33 I think the moral of the story is if you bring a 2 litres bottle of cooking oil any woman can agree to marry you, considering our little sichaz, you know. That's my 2 cents on this.
6674 2018-10-09 13:18:26 Oil refinery is a fair point and especially that it’s subsidized. Our offshore emissions are world leading. To cut emissions there would increase them elsewhere from dirtier sources

6700 2018-10-09 13:16:13 Nov 4 is a deadline for bringing our oil exports from Iran to zero. The balancing act with Tehran on one side and the rest on other is anything but easy to put it midly. This whole affair hasn't crystallized yet to draw conclusions.

6710 2018-10-09 13:15:13 Government bond prices ended sharply down, as Rupee touched record lows, thereby sparking fear of FPI outflows. Results of auction of state government bonds showed a wide range in the 10-year papers. Also, rise in crude oil prices kept bonds under pressure.
6711 2018-10-09 13:15:13 We use white flower oil topically, shots of fire cider, and drink a tisane of chamomile, spearmint and hibiscus in hot lemon honey water with cayenne.

6714 2018-10-09 13:14:57 The problem is free markets gain and retain power, too. Oil companies poach patents for electric cars and sit on them to curtain any competition/lost business. I understand (and share) weariness about a big state, but this problem calls for drastic action 
6715 2018-10-09 13:14:56 UK too quiet re this too!!!!  But Saudi biggest oil reserves in the World! Saudi buy $$$$$$$$ Billions of armaments/other goods . Reaction monstrously  not about  killing an innocent journalist is about  $$$$$$$$$$  commerce and is  worse than aberration ?

6749 2018-10-09 13:11:36 Hello George, that worthwhile petition has closed. Maybe now's the time to re-open it or start a new one?  BBC is trying to claim that by giving Ebell a platform they are giving space to "dissenting voices".  A PR voice funded by oil and tobacco.
6750 2018-10-09 13:11:32 @MBuhari @apc @OfficialPDPNig why is fuel(PMS) still sold at N145 per litre when crude oil is almost 90 dollar per barrel in the international market??
6751 2018-10-09 13:11:12 It was. None of this bullshit with palm oil. Just peanuts and salt.
6752 2018-10-09 13:11:10 Next, the case of hot sauce, harrisa (a hot sauce, sesame oil, and he declared unto his word for insta cups.
6753 2018-10-09 13:11:03 We can still stop burning wood and furnace oil, start driving electric vehicles (or at least smaller ones) and fly less. There are always ways to improve.

6755 2018-10-09 13:10:54 What does WALL ST. do when "we the people" disagree with the TRUMP FAMILY? Raise gas/heating oil on TRUMP DEMAND? Raise oil prices to benefit RUSSIA? Conspire with K STREET LOBBYISTS to pass a TAX RELIEF BILL?
6756 2018-10-09 13:10:52 I have been there and amongst all 6 SS states, Akwa-Ibom and C. River stand out. They are all supposed to be oil producing states.

6759 2018-10-09 13:10:31 It’s beyond terrifying to be involved in. I was involved in a work place explosion last year at an oil n gas plant, and it takes awhile to get over it, especially the front line workers. Still today I have negative effects as a result of it affecting my life. Time helps though.
6760 2018-10-09 13:10:30 i agree the initial demand change is marginal.  

it is about market access.  ethanol needs it (should get it imo as best alt. today) and big oil and merchant refiners are fighting tooth and nail to not allow it.

6781 2018-10-09 13:09:02 How to double cleanse:
Step 1. Use a cleansing oil. Oil breaks down oil so a cleansing oil/ balm is my favorite way to remove my makeup. It also breaks down oil from the environment. 
Step 2. Use a soap free cleanser to wash away the rest

6829 2018-10-09 13:04:49 Double cleansing is essential to do before bed because you want to make sure you’re going to sleep with the cleanest skin possible. Sleeping with leftover oil and debris can lead to clogged pores, dry skin and painful cystic breakouts 
6830 2018-10-09 13:04:44 GOP fracks & ravages our environment to extricate minerals, ores, oil & gas. GOP is liquidating America, selling fast. Stockpiling by private industry explains persevering stock index. When America’s wealth; our natural resources, are gone, we have nothing left to bank on.
6831 2018-10-09 13:04:40 Actually, they remind me of "wood borers" that live in beetle kill. They crew big holes in everything beautiful, and leave behind nasty piles of sawdust. Only way to get rid of them is with a long soaking in oil.

6847 2018-10-09 13:03:09 oil has been trending up this year -- would put more emphasis on reserve trends among the oil importers actually.  and on the change in the dollar's course.

6859 2018-10-09 13:02:01 LOL, from an oil company's web site. That's CLEARLY impartial evidence.
6860 2018-10-09 13:02:00 You’re finally home from your exhausting day, and you’re ready to wash your face. But does your cleanser alone break down the oil and debris that’s in your pores from the day? It doesn’t. Which is why before bed, we double cleanse.

6891 2018-10-09 12:59:22 It's much more complicated than the outfits that female athletes wore before and after 1979. To over simplify, it's a mix of religion, politics, oil and history. Iran was a democratic country in 1953.
6892 2018-10-09 12:59:19 Not true!  The Earth has been around for 4.6 billion years and will be around for another 5 billion.

6900 2018-10-09 12:58:40 Limonene and linalool are natural components of plants and herbs. Just like peppermint oil repels insects and even mice maybe that's why it is used in pesticides.

6912 2018-10-09 12:57:18 Ha! Looks like a bottle of cooking oil. What is that penguin as well? I see it around the city everywhere. I guess it belongs to one of the shops.
6913 2018-10-09 12:57:11 This is interesting, because I assume the appropriate level of consultation has taken place within the indigenous communities? How has this been sold? Often the economic objectives of the state aren’t the same as what you’d find within minority groups. #indigenous #oil
6914 2018-10-09 12:57:06 Don't speak out about the Fluffles. He'll boil you in oil.
6915 2018-10-09 12:57:04 Las tarifas siguen subsidias.  Enarsa importa a 7 usd de bolivia y a 10 x barco y lo vende a 3.90 !!! Y la luz esta ahora al 50% del precio de los combustibles para generar( gas y gas oil).

6917 2018-10-09 12:57:02 Funny - the Con tour. Are they selling snake oil?
6918 2018-10-09 12:56:54 And while Trump is playing to corn belt farmers, the move has met with resistance from Republicans in oil producing and refining states. 
Let's be clear, ethanol has long been a political football, especially with Iowa being the first presidential caucus state.

6920 2018-10-09 12:56:43 Oh hang on, do you mean the goose that is the union? If so, I would expect Scots to bring up the subject of North Sea oil revenues pretty promptly.
6921 2018-10-09 12:56:40 Hopefully this oil change doesn’t take forever. I’m tired af.
6922 2018-10-09 12:56:39 @bathbodyworks so I ordered several things and never received my peppermint oil. I emailed customer service and it’s been ever a week I have not received any response from them in regards to my missing item! #poorcustomerservive #bathandbodyworks.
6923 2018-10-09 12:56:29 Don't forget the EIA Johnny or the HFTraders at the NY Fed. Lot of powerful forces & people trying to tweet/talk/trade oil down.
6924 2018-10-09 12:56:28 Alaskans own 33,855 shares of FREEHOLD ROYALTIES LTD, worth $342,193. It's from the OIL & GAS sector, based in CANADA.

6929 2018-10-09 12:55:45 It's very possible that the #chemtrails are making #climatechange much worse.  God knows what it's doing to the health of people:  aluminum barium lithium and manno particles of all sorts.  We used to call this skywriting with smoke oil.  Look up.
6930 2018-10-09 12:55:26 bless up for oil face wipes. without those you could cook a chicken on my face.
6931 2018-10-09 12:55:16 Shouldn't surprise you. One country I know, is the largest oil producer in Africa but their leaders pay salaries and pensions, then expect the masses to applaud them for it. Maduro should take notes from Nigeria's Leaders from past to present, on how to diminish hope
6932 2018-10-09 12:55:14 Such metal much oil
6933 2018-10-09 12:55:13 Just like W opened our air space to Saudis & Bin Laden family on 9/11!!  Americans were all grounded except for military!  OIL $$$ over Patriotism!!
6934 2018-10-09 12:55:06 Especially when you compare the oil price now to the price when US #EnergyDominance began last year

6955 2018-10-09 12:53:18 They got right on that tax cut for the rich right away. The ACA, is still in place. Your premiums are still high. They got right on that pipeline. So the rich wouldn't have to pay so much to have the oil moved around. They told you it would lower gas prices.Wrong and the poor pay
6956 2018-10-09 12:53:17 avoid products containing palm oil. As for the public transport, the German government is really contradictory:the prices for trains are high and its cheaper to pay for a car instead of using the train.The trains are also often late.
6957 2018-10-09 12:53:15 Me too!! We are Italian... It's pretty much blasphemy if we don't.  We could get kicked out of our heritage for anything less than total submission to the olive oil gods.

6967 2018-10-09 12:52:36 Art - Majors back up on capex in low pricing environments, normal nothing you don’t know here.  Unnormal is launching capex beneath breakin pricing as with tight oil.  Majors investing in Permian I view as name recognition for investors not about returns.
6968 2018-10-09 12:52:35 Just basically a $1 dollar bill which has been so heavily recycled that not even one atom of currency remains in the final piece of paper given to the snake oil salesman.

7011 2018-10-09 12:45:59 The CO2 paradox is that years ago volcanic activity resulted in acute CO2 and ash that blocked out the sun and killed the animals.

7037 2018-10-09 12:43:53 Climate Change is not based on individuals but instead based on nations that strive for economic equality on an international level.

7054 2018-10-09 12:42:25 Growth in industries that do no speed the destruction of the planet. Not oil pipelines and coal. Growth in industries to utilize energy with less harmful waste more efficiently. Like pretty much all the industries the GOP currently doesn’t support

7056 2018-10-09 12:42:18 It’s very hard to tell a curtain generation that were given so much hope that the ‘white heat of Nuclear technology’ and the post war ‘oil boom’ was an environmental disaster that must be stopped. The only way is to show new green tech will give us all far more without killing us
7057 2018-10-09 12:42:05 Wrong. The Iran Deal was working. Every expert agreed. Trump withdrew as an excuse to lift sanctions on Russia to supply the lost oil. Russia is the largest sponsor of state terrorism. They fund and supply the Taliban. And #TraitorTrump is #PutinsPuppet. Helsinki #TreasonSummit

7319 2018-10-09 12:16:54 Israel on the Golan heights is thieving Syrian energy resources by allowing oil drilling. Genie oil, a Murdoch/Rothschild company, has Carlyle group and ex US vice president as a director. The state of Israel does not have any legal reasoning to steal Syrian oil.

7323 2018-10-09 12:16:29 @CNBC Please stop promoting oil. Burning fossil fuels such as oil and coal are killing our planet. THE RICH DO NOT OWN OUR PLANET!
7324 2018-10-09 12:16:21 It's the best non renewable energy source. I'm all for renewable energy, but I also support rationality and the realization that we're still far away from full renewables and doing nothing for current coal/gas/oil is a disaster.
7325 2018-10-09 12:16:20 OIL: Oil prices rose on growing evidence of falling crude exports from Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, before the imposition of new U.S. sanctions and a partial shutdown in the Gulf of Mexico due to Hurricane Michael.
7326 2018-10-09 12:16:11 Equally, cigarettes have not been an essential part of Western life for the past century, without which society would collapse. Of course the oil firms lobby, of course they have made it harder to shift to a low-carbon economy, but they are not the ones doing the emitting.

7329 2018-10-09 12:15:52 That's very easy to achieve with stolen funds. Just give me oil blocs! I don't even need to steal directly from the treasury , I will employ 100K people. The biz will survive by wielding the power of corruption .....

7367 2018-10-09 12:10:25 According to my own experience crude oil is not for consumption. It is used to produce fuels such as petrol,diesel, kerosine, detagents etc. If Puredrop is using crude oil to manufacture cooking oil then its a threat as far as health is concerned. If am not mistaken.
7368 2018-10-09 12:10:18 Way to twist the truth into a pretzel, lyin' Ted. Beto voted against a non-binding resolution that opposed the idea of a per-barrel tax on oil. Texans must be crazy to vote for YOU.

7457 2018-10-09 12:00:45 Strange feeling today. For a couple of years now I have been talking with friends about oil being doomed but today was the first time i really felt its true.
7458 2018-10-09 12:00:40 I always feel brand new whenever I wash my dreads and put tea tree oil in them 
7459 2018-10-09 12:00:37 you can do your own w a little coconut oil & coarse sugar 
7460 2018-10-09 12:00:36 Imagine the ‘nourishes the skin’ logic applies to both. My housemate used coconut oil too for his sleeve and had no issues + solid healing.
7461 2018-10-09 12:00:35 We're at three million year highs for CO2 levels. Oil use is 40% higher today than when the 1992 Rio Climate Summit was held. It was said then that we only had ten years to sort out climate change.

It's a quarter century later now.

7553 2018-10-09 11:49:27 $80 is the trigger point for oil. An interesting comparison is the actual average price of gasoline, which has remained pretty constant.

7588 2018-10-09 11:45:37 You are dead wrong about that.
CBD oil is legal in almost all states.
CBD has .3% of THC or less.
Industrial hemp is grown in Kentucky and other states. That also has .3% THC or less.
Then most states Have medical, and a few states have recreational

7622 2018-10-09 11:40:13 Thanks for the link, I will go through it but then again if things are better why are we not feeling it? You argue about oil prices and how the barrel sold at $120 under GEJ and $80 under PMB. I ask, how much was the $ to N then and now? Who earns more? Let me read the article.
7623 2018-10-09 11:40:13 To keep a lamp burning, we have to keep putting oil in it
7624 2018-10-09 11:40:10 #PTI n #PMIK will cure the economic malaise left by PMLN..PML-N government’s tenure failed to stimulate the economy considering  the low global oil prices and historically low global interest rates  environment on offer.

If Shetland breaks from Scotland & EU, then We'll miss you.
If it chooses UK over a Faeroes/Norway route & writes its own Act of Union with brexit-London, then London will have some oil & a home for Trident.
7648 2018-10-09 11:38:01 well you have a nice day for sitting there.
Looks like lots of activity which is grat.
7649 2018-10-09 11:37:40 Dollar is v strong across the board, Oil prices are climbing as well, will settle gradually..

7655 2018-10-09 11:37:11 They don’t care. They’re not about to let disruptive technologies negatively affect their portfolios. The oil and gas industry and their lobbyists have stopped any attempts to change course to protect our planet’s future. #TippingPoint
7656 2018-10-09 11:37:04 @realDonaldTrump For us, Iran's gas is not very important, only Iran's oil is very important, and all refineries must cut their oil from Iran by November 4, otherwise they should forget about the US markets, the exemption is unacceptable and never forgivable. is not.
7657 2018-10-09 11:36:53 There exist certain girls who do not opt to highlight or color hair as per common fashion norms, or do not straighten them or opt any other chemical treatment. They use home remedies, oil their hair for keeping them healthy. And it is normal. Nothing to be surprised.

7666 2018-10-09 11:35:57 Yes its good. But poor peoples hv gotten burden in shape of uplift prices of gas, electricity, oil, and indirectly through currency devaluation and due to dollar .
7667 2018-10-09 11:35:57 yes. that is, poor policies again, govt. not ready to allow more companies to do business in Pak cz frndz running tota etc companies, making profits.
on the other hand not promoting local industry or at least assembling.
but our major imports : edible oil, steel, electronics
7668 2018-10-09 11:35:47 Would it surprise anyone if it turned out that #Iran global oil exports have not dropped in anticipation of US sanctions and have actually increased. The world continues to pay lip service to Washington as we have been saying for the last 12 months.

7678 2018-10-09 11:35:02 Reminds me of Zim. Very slippery slope. Is it justified to reduce everything to ruin just so you can stand up to sanctions? I really wonder if the West would be this bothered if oil wasn't involved.
7679 2018-10-09 11:34:51 Quick Google search says it just means the oil is well used and is normal. Imo it means it might need a refresh soon but that is just my opinion.
7680 2018-10-09 11:34:35 An oil well.
7681 2018-10-09 11:34:21 Yeah been hearing this BS since the 70's... still not dead yet.. we were supposed to run out of food.. hmmm seems that's not the problem.. we were supposed to be out of oil.. again not an issue..
7682 2018-10-09 11:34:11 We went into the weed again pretty strong and the CBD oil too. Between all of it, the government began their crackdown on opioids and it made it harder. But we also need to cut down the ILLEGAL opioids by sealing the borders, and stopping Chinese illegal Fentyall

7731 2018-10-09 11:29:24 Good point Fred, but did us and at under a fiver it lined the stomach nicely - maybe a smidge of truffle oil on the eggs would have made it perfect for me!!!!!
7732 2018-10-09 11:29:20 There’s a difference between where we get our oil and how much we consume.  Please tell me how many Climate change bills did Mitch McConnel and the GOP majority pass that Obama refused to sign?
7733 2018-10-09 11:29:18 We’re talking Mercedes not Bugatti. What does it cost to change the oil?
7734 2018-10-09 11:29:11 what if you had done this years ago instead doing everything in your power to continue producing and promoting oil?

7744 2018-10-09 11:27:28 Of I can think of a few things.  Like "no more planes and parts for them."  Or even "no more oil, and no more dollars either."  Oh, you want to use FedWire? How does "fuck off!" sound in response?

7749 2018-10-09 11:27:04 US debt is growing steady despite a good economy, illegal immigration is rising after years of a steady decline. Diplomatic relations are low, opened Alaska for oil exploration And there is the lying.

7753 2018-10-09 11:26:19 Very true. But the groundnut pyramid,cocoa production, palm Oil,rubber and timber were relegated immediately we had the Oil boom, hence the sliding of #Nigeria till date.
How long can we hold up to this retrogressive system?

7774 2018-10-09 11:23:56 I aint an oil hng- hellooo! What's your name and do you followback? ><
7775 2018-10-09 11:23:56 Of course, Corbyn and McDonnell are right to eschew the 1970s. Heath’s Competion and Credit Control initiative led to 35%  rise in consumer prices between 1971-74. The fall in the pound and oil price that followed cursed the following decade.

7780 2018-10-09 11:23:06 Bro go to the docs - don’t put anything in there! To the doc! I had a perforated eardrum (from my grappling days) and adding oil didn’t help
7781 2018-10-09 11:23:05 Its a pity we didn't use our oil revenues to set up a SWF....

7783 2018-10-09 11:23:03 These Text book supporters.. If things are good we will know we don't need seminars.

When you buy garri, rice, oil, yam etc you will know if the economy is favourable or not.

We can't take these long threads to the market and buy anything with them.
7784 2018-10-09 11:22:40 Sir two factors 1) OIL 2) FED rates. This fall is only playing out for the first one. When second one comes into play , would like to what happens to EM basket as a whole.

7863 2018-10-09 11:13:23 Yeah.   No Carbon Tax on heating supplies in NI.   Bag of coal approx 7 euro cheaper there.   1000 litres of Hesting oil approx 150 euro cheaper there.    Depending on exchange rates etc.

8025 2018-10-09 10:55:20 Russia just sold a few hundred bn USTreasuries. Most small net oil exporters sell their USD. And if they do not sell, they stabilize their own currency, which enables them to increase money supply, which increases worldwide growth.
8026 2018-10-09 10:55:16 If the Oil trade can comment, WHY can't AVIATION ? -Oh yes there is no more manipulating room available.-
8027 2018-10-09 10:55:06 Oil is set to touch 100 and rupee is crying at 74.34 and saying #Metoo
8028 2018-10-09 10:55:06 This is a wrong approach. Buhari spent billions on looking for oil in the Chad basin instead of investing in education and healthcare. 

Why can't our healthcare work? It takes vision, hardwork, right investment, amongst others. 

Let's Get Nigeria Working Again.
8029 2018-10-09 10:55:02 @Eugenia_Cooney Proverbs 3:5
For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword.
Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.

8034 2018-10-09 10:54:35 I drank green tea this morning and now I am cooking with coconut oil. I cannot believe I have to shop for a new wardrobe because I am about to lose 10kg.
8035 2018-10-09 10:54:24 We have the tech and resources to do this in 12 years, however it will cost money. It will create more jobs not loose any. The profits will shift from global oil to tech. start-ups. Shell, BP etc already have a toe in the water but will find it difficult protecting their profits.
8036 2018-10-09 10:54:23 ok in some cases i agreed to that point coercion , that is a problem not only at work place but every where, like in banglows where women face that problem too

One possibillity, but not the only.

8062 2018-10-09 10:51:19 well thats the correct statement. Going to IMF is begging and close to a suicide. Anyone would agree to that. But the years when the oil prices were around $50 we witnessed the most irresponsible economic (mis)management. Debt loading was done purposefully and $ used to prop Rs.
8063 2018-10-09 10:51:10 It could happen in our lifetime. I wouldn’t let the oil in my lamp run out. We should all be watching and ready as if he were coming tomorrow.

Soon herbicides industry will mushroom to support the sector. We really don’t grasp economic Development
8070 2018-10-09 10:50:18 Let’s hope the greedy rich leaders and cooperation can put planet Earth  before their bank balances and start going green ! There’s is money in other sources other than the oil and coal industries

8084 2018-10-09 10:48:21 There are alternatives but lithium ion/cobalt oxide batteries are clearly a not viable solution due to shortages of those metals. I’m seriously considering an all electric car as our next vehicle. I think they are the future. Also, watch out for an oil shortage in ~2020
8085 2018-10-09 10:48:17 @therealginsters just read the ingredients on my pasty while it's cooking and have seen you list palm oil in the veg oil make up....does it come from a reputable source that is not associated with rain forest destruction ?

8095 2018-10-09 10:47:33 blaming oil companies for the emissions of greenhouse gases is silly. governments and consumers need to be blamed. public transport, car use, etc, will result in shifts in fossil fuel use. change that and extraction rates drop

8109 2018-10-09 10:46:38 The failure of political leadership is compounded by their inability to look up from their carbon-economy funded troughs long enough to recognise that current developments in technology provide long term support to the removal of oil dependence.

All it needs is a little vision.

8128 2018-10-09 10:45:22 Once our Govts accept that theres no future in oil production anywhere we start from there. Just as mining towns had to accept new reality.

8166 2018-10-09 10:41:10 Oil      whisky tourism renewable energy need i go on what they havent got they steal from us weve been subsidising them for years lets stop messing about lets do this now declare independance
8167 2018-10-09 10:41:03 They are all in the same position. But if this worries you take a look at Palm oil. The effect on the environment is as bad if not worse
8168 2018-10-09 10:41:00 I'm not talking about USA oil. There are lucrative options India can offer to USA. Purchases like defense equipment (which are already in line i believe), more access to Indian markets, or possibly signing FTA.

8170 2018-10-09 10:40:55 Realistic scenarios suggest that global temperature may reach +1.5°C by as soon as 2030. 
Unless we want to take extreme risks, the burning of coal, oil and nat gas needs to stop ASAP. Alternatives are available and must be put in place with great urgency. Not by 2050!
8171 2018-10-09 10:40:51 Pull up an EEM chart and oil. Look what happens when they diverge.

8173 2018-10-09 10:40:44 Report after report comes out yet they focus on oil
8174 2018-10-09 10:40:41 The author, like the subject, is an idiot pandering to economic warfare and regime change for oil.
8175 2018-10-09 10:40:41 Pres.Duterte on VP Leni's statement about inflation: wala tayong oil kaya pag tumaas ang presyo ng langis wala tayong kontrol @AbanteNews
8176 2018-10-09 10:40:41 @NEAD_UK I’ve had a few people mention CBD oil as something that could reduce the number of seizures I am having. I am very wary of any advice that’s not coming from a medical professional.Have you heard of this being prescribed at all? I am seeing my psychiatric doctor on Monday
8177 2018-10-09 10:40:30 Oh but Modi ji reduced oil prices after so much hue n cry by opposition. Now govt itself is protesting. Really v funny. Janta sab dekh rahi hai sirjee..

8180 2018-10-09 10:40:22 while producing meat produces gases that heat the world. sadly plants produce more Carbon Dioxide than oxygen whilst there growing. at full grown when it changes we eat them. not sure going vegan is going to help. stop cutting down tropical forests for palm oil will be better

8188 2018-10-09 10:39:34 Young people who might not vote, Do you ever think about having kids and taking them on family vacations? Trump & the GOP want to start mining and oil drilling in our national parks, put oil rigs on all our beaches. Vote Democratic to save our parks and vistas.
8189 2018-10-09 10:39:29 It's all the oil 
8190 2018-10-09 10:39:28 Yesterday the IPCC report on climate change came out. Today London hosts the Oil & Money conference. Check the hashtag #OM2018. Plus ca change.
8191 2018-10-09 10:39:26 Panasnya bikin pengen mandi pake olive oil, YaAllah kulit kering bgt ini rasanya dari muka sampe kaki
8192 2018-10-09 10:39:17 The recipe was a bit random: I made the dough with strong white bread flour, sugar, almond milk and a good glug of sunflower oil. The filling was a lot of stuff that was going out of date: hazelnuts, walnuts, pine nuts and figs. Roast the nuts. 1/2

8197 2018-10-09 10:38:49 Mouais. Tout reste quand meme désespérément généraliste .. a quand la "publicité" pour les mesures concrète comme celle @theShiftPR0JECT sur la consommation des voitures ou celle de @nWassociation pour Instaurer une taxe kilométrique sur le fret routier ?
8198 2018-10-09 10:38:45 No way !!! forget timber and crude oil -this is our greatest export!
8199 2018-10-09 10:38:37 もっと大きいの。。。。。。。。。
8200 2018-10-09 10:38:22 Who wants to devalue their currency?It's the wrong policies that lead to devaluation. When exports are down, and you have to pay all the ingredients of your newly commissioned power plants, i.e., oil & gas in dollars value of the dollar will go up. Who was in govt for last 5 yr?
8201 2018-10-09 10:38:13 Gas prices alone will eat up $10 week. It'll cost $250 more for heating oil (about $1000 annually), health insurance up $100 month, mortgage interest up 2 points.
8202 2018-10-09 10:38:11 Not that I recommend ecological disasters...but remember reading

8206 2018-10-09 10:37:56 La Serpe omschrijft Jesse R. “als een mieterig type, in een testosteron omgeving. Hij gebruikte Oil of Olaz. Er werd achter zijn rug om gepraat. Ik was degene die eerlijk over hem sprak.” #Holleeder
8207 2018-10-09 10:37:56 But maybe not the way you think. To back out of the reform, Putin needs funds & his only reliable way of getting these with the shabby economy he has is oil. So I wouldn't be surprised to see war in Ukraine again, in the Balkans/Tan countries to push oil prices up 2 or 3 notches
8208 2018-10-09 10:37:49 焼肉を伴うオフですか！？

8217 2018-10-09 10:36:40 He is right
8218 2018-10-09 10:36:32 $800 billion??
How did you come to this figure? How much does Nigeria earn a year from oil? What the annual national budget? $25B?
$800B is over 30 years national budget that includes salaries of civil servants.
8219 2018-10-09 10:36:06 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President, are you oblivious to the fact oil prices have doubled?  Small businesses are now hurting, as we cannot raise our prices to offset this gouging by speculators. Please focus on this issue.
8220 2018-10-09 10:36:00 Or maybe an oil he could rub on...
8221 2018-10-09 10:35:55 Has anyone tried CBD oil for their depression or pain relief? I'm just wondering if they found it helpful?
8222 2018-10-09 10:35:47 It was settled in the 1980s when the oil companies modelled 2C temp gain. 
We just went along with the pal reviewed research  It put my kids through the Universty ... :)
8223 2018-10-09 10:35:24 I'm sorry sis, but these oil revenues got me bidi ba dum boo'd up.

8229 2018-10-09 10:34:22 When the oil price went to $25 a few years ago that would have bankrupted an independent Scottish economy.
8230 2018-10-09 10:34:17 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
8231 2018-10-09 10:34:11 Also, they invited India as a partner in arctic oil exploration.

8234 2018-10-09 10:33:46 it once happened with us. it might be that the fryer has too much oil in it?
8235 2018-10-09 10:33:27 Olive Oil would be jealous!
8236 2018-10-09 10:33:23 International money markets won't fund your deficit based on oil income, or if they do they'll demand a way bigger premium than you currently pay as part of UK (1.25%). As for whisky income...I hope you're joking

8241 2018-10-09 10:32:47 So the Irish want Scotland with its oil money but not too keen on taking the North of their own country!

8243 2018-10-09 10:32:33 She got fined for selling jade and rose quartz for *cough* internal use and some essential oil because she made false medical claims about them.
8244 2018-10-09 10:32:27 In essence, global oil consumption provides a subsidy to the U.S. economy for "free".  Hence, the Europeans created the euro to compete with the dollar as an alternative international reserve currency and its subsidy also for "free".

8252 2018-10-09 10:31:31 At least most organic shops sell unpacked fruit and vegetables, and there are special shops selling even oil etc. unpacked ("Unverpackt-Läden", like Flinse in Düsseldorf-Flingern). Have to support those shops, so the big chains will eventually change too.

8266 2018-10-09 10:29:29 Nope, major oil sellers don't FX their USD into other currencies. They are either USD pegged or hold the foreign (USD) reserves to back their own currency.

8282 2018-10-09 10:27:40 .@Shell CEO Ben van Beurden:  Shell’s annual spending is $1-2 billion on renewables, of total $25 billion yearly capex. But pace of change on renewables will be linked to pace of change of society. “Shell’s core business is, and will be for the foreseeable future, oil and gas.”
8283 2018-10-09 10:27:36 On tourne en rond indéfiniment sur le "bon" discours de mobilisation. L'inertie sociétale est semblable à l'inertie climatique, des générations entières sont bercées au développement et à la quête de richesse. On doit continuer à "lutter" mais...

8291 2018-10-09 10:26:42 It's easy to say smart things about energy solutions when you live far away from the problems. Renewable energy is so expensive, that no Greek is able to pay for it. Drilling for oil and natural gas around Greece will be so far away from touristic areas that none will notice.

8295 2018-10-09 10:25:54 When I was in the Air Force we claimed to be the world's largest single purchaser of crude oil, so I'd imagine quite a bit. Don't ask Generals to limit flight-time, though, because the costs to operational readiness would be unquantifiable!
8296 2018-10-09 10:25:53 I’m sure a vegan spread without palm oil exists and will become more popular should there be demand. I don’t think a lack of vegan sandwich spread is a reason not to consider a plant based diet. Also, you could not have spread on your sandwich....

Mais je pense que l’effet pervers de dire « bon finalement, ça va être 2°C » sera « bon donc on a encore le temps d’attendre. Et puis 2°C / 3°C, au fond quelle différence » ?
8303 2018-10-09 10:24:35 Shell boss Ben van Beurden: headlines over Shell moves into electric cars and hydrogen “might even make people think we have gone soft on the future of oil and gas. If they did think that… they would be wrong.” #OM2018

8306 2018-10-09 10:24:16 .@Shell CEO: we will not disconnect ourselves from our customers’ needs now in order to transition to cleaner energies. Will pace our transition with pace of society’s shift #OM2018 #OOTT #oil
8307 2018-10-09 10:24:13 Bloody iniquitous! What can you do except rail against it,keep on trucking and hope to strike oil in the back garden.The price of diesel went up OVERNIGHT by 4p.  AND £2.60 for a cup of Costa coffee and that’s a ripoff n’all,and we’re not even on the motorway......

8310 2018-10-09 10:23:45 Oui, bien sûr - mais même ça, ça se discute : ce qui est déraisonnable, c’est de continuer à s’organiser pour aller vers les +3°C. 
Et comme chaque 1/10 (dès maintenant, pas magiquement à partir des 1,5°C) implique des millions de victimes, je suis très réticent à m’en défaire.
8311 2018-10-09 10:23:38 J’ai du mal m’exprimer. Je voulais pas du tout dire que la partie est perdue, mais que 2 degrés est probablement déjà un objectif ambitieux. Politiquement ça ne change rien, il faut maintenir la pression maximale sur l’industrie.
8312 2018-10-09 10:23:37 .@Shell ceo says energy major not going "soft" on oil and gas. Spending on new energies is only $1-2bn out of total annual capex of around $25bn #OM2018
8313 2018-10-09 10:23:25 I think merger between Ensco $ESV and Rowan $RDC is a good fit. Combined fleet value over 8 billion and   now the largest player in the jack-up sector. Those who have consolidated will benefit. Pricing power, diversified, better access to capital markets, synergies #oil #oott
8314 2018-10-09 10:23:11 At the end of the day, it all comes down to the question of whether you want oil and meat.

8318 2018-10-09 10:22:50 .@Shell CEO: headlines around our investments in hydrogen, power, new energies are true but can be misleading - not soft on future of #oil and #gas #OM2018
8319 2018-10-09 10:22:48 Indeed they are world issues. But that does not address the fact that the food industry - vegan or otherwise - is heavily reliant on both soy and palm oil. For example, it is very difficult to find an affordable plant-based sandwich spread that is not riddled with palm oil.

8440 2018-10-09 10:05:23 Now, India decided to go against US sanctions on Iran instead of bringing crude oil imports from country to zero by November 4.

India places fresh order for Iranian Crude to go ahead with Chahbahar Port & route to Afghanistan.

PM Modi has also given priority to Nation Interest.

8446 2018-10-09 10:04:18 Actually there’s a lot of profit and margin in the wind energy sector. The oil business is just booming because it so much easier and the most widely used in our country. We have bills in place for a goal of renewable for 2030 and 2050. We are moving towards that
8447 2018-10-09 10:04:14 But sir, asking out of curiosity, since we do not have enough OIL Reserve/Capacity to meet our demand, aren't we exposed to rising Crude Oil prices all the time and it takes toll on everything. Starting from basic necessity to luxury.
8448 2018-10-09 10:04:12 You never cease to amaze me. To have the audacity to say something so righteous while allowing Big Oil to extract the dirtiest oil on the planet & refusing to protect the millions of Californians being legally poisoned by neighborhood drilling. Shame on you. #BrownsLastChance
8449 2018-10-09 10:04:10 Have you ever tried Crabwood oil on your skin?  Great as an anti mosquito, anti sandfly remedy.  Possibly also off putting for Cabora flies??
8450 2018-10-09 10:04:00 BBC giving gwyneth paltrow free advertainment for her vaginal snake oil delivery system is a bit of a weird one. At least its nice to know you can still be successful despite going absolutely bonkers.
8451 2018-10-09 10:03:57 true that.....2 packs of spag can even feed more than 4 people. Even though, I'll rather use veg oil & tomato for a jollof spag feel than red oil...However, great idea though

He's not wrong. It's time @sim_manchester and the @sciencemuseum stopped legitimising its business plans.

8561 2018-10-09 09:47:56 Totally shocking but it seems this is how humans operate (some) perhaps they are scared of change? Or have some other ulterior motive such as making money off oil/gas and betting on stock to go down. As I always say dangerous to bet against innovation
8562 2018-10-09 09:47:26 Do you really not see the game dude? Spend money so it can “fail” while oil and coal pay lobbyists to pass laws that suppress renewable energy. Gotta spend money to keep making money. 500 mill to suppress competition is the game baby

8698 2018-10-09 09:27:16 I live in Aberdeen where a lot of tax is made for the new Scottish revenue service via high paying oil jobs. I am not a fan of the oil sector. But  sorry you can't just shut it down overnight.

8818 2018-10-09 09:07:22 "Our factory has more than enough capacity to meet the national demand for cooking oil". This does not automatically translate to producing enough to meet national demand. Having capacity is good for the country, production on the other hand depends on various factors.

8842 2018-10-09 09:01:31 The funny thing is that UAE doesn't import gas condensates from their other neighbor, Qatar, but are instead importing them from Corpus Christi, Texas. The emirate of Dubai in particular has better oil relations with Iran than Abu Dhabi does, as Dubai doesn't produce oil.

8851 2018-10-09 09:00:01 @MileHigherPod (2/2) because they state that it’s not legal at all, only hemp seed oil is. Do you have any info from the site saying they’re approved to import into Aus? I want to order but don’t wanna be arrested lmao
8852 2018-10-09 09:00:01 until they make renewable or carbon neutral the cheapest form of heat/transport etc it will be an uphill battle. I would love to change to solar for heat & buy an electric car but they are so far out of my price range it's currently unthinkable, so it's burn coal/oil or be cold
8853 2018-10-09 08:59:54 Global Warming is not the issue.
There's a bigger truth behind this.
All this push about climate change and reducing carbon emissions etc.
What they don't want to admit is the real truth, which is. 
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF OIL

8855 2018-10-09 08:59:37 Indeed, until oil prices fell from their 2008 high ($140/barrel; $500 was predicted on the cover of Fortune), and then crashed in 2014 (also the year of the Crimean annexation, which brought sanctions). The ruble is still low, and Russians are currently very grumpy.

8872 2018-10-09 08:56:39 Nuclear power was the easy safest answer, but the oil industry quietly invested heavily in promoting the false belief that radiation was more dangerous than spewing crap in the air, just like they killed the first electric cars in the 90's for more profit in gas powered vehicles.

8918 2018-10-09 08:48:26 I'm in favor of region-states, but unless you have an overarching framework for trade deals (i.e. the US/German government or the EU) you kill trade. Norway was poor until they found oil, Singapore and Swiss have very little exports.

8936 2018-10-09 08:45:45 Basically you want the NZ govt to forego taxes on order to subsidise profits for big oil.
8937 2018-10-09 08:45:42 Would have many trillion of barrels of as yet undrilled oil. Many trillions of cubic feet of untapped natural gas. Two of the five "big banks" and ownership of approx 19% of every rented property in England.

We'd cope.
8938 2018-10-09 08:45:07 This doesn't prove anything tho, it works on block chain Technology which will be used in the future for normal money transfers. Will money now be Haram then? And the fact that it's increasing and decreasing value is because of demand and supply nothing more, same as oil

9108 2018-10-09 08:19:04 Oh really? Wow now that will cause a few problems. I went to Bahrain in 2006 and was told they make their money by being paid not to produce oil by their neighbours. Interesting to see what happens with that as well if Saudi are changing so dramatically.
9109 2018-10-09 08:19:03 As a disabled woman living with debilitating conditions, I know full well the extent to which women are disbelieved & dismissed when seeking treatment.

This doesn’t change the fact that there is nothing benign about selling snake oil to desperate or worried people.

Scotland under EU not WTO rules, with oil, gas and whiskey to start with.
9138 2018-10-09 08:16:06 Hi there, our engineers did go out to this. The oil was coming from a private oil tank at the back of one of the units. We've put a spill kit in place to prevent the oil going into the brook and contacted the letting agents for the unit. Thanks for reporting this to us, Lauren.

9147 2018-10-09 08:14:49 I don’t believe that England would be bankrupt after Scottish independence. The lack of oil revenue would no doubt have an impact. I think Scotland is rich in assets and would easily prosper (id suggest more balanced view of your article reading ). Currency should be scots pound
9148 2018-10-09 08:14:45 bottles of oil worry about you; sponges worry about you; therefore sponges are bottles of oil

9174 2018-10-09 08:11:37 Ha. You can manipulate cooking temperatures with fat combinations, as they all have different boiling temperatures. Olive oil has a relatively low one, for example, but higher than butter. Hope you'll enjoy.

9185 2018-10-09 08:10:21 Reduction in oil prices caused drop in commodity price and resulted in drop in exports too. Didn't it?

9221 2018-10-09 08:04:53 and a opportunity to illegally invade the sovereignty of Syria, Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan. I've also heard ISIS BEING EVACUATED TO SAFETY BY US!.

9240 2018-10-09 08:02:10 The democrats did nothing about this when they had power, so what makes you think they’ll do something now? Obama ramped up oil production here and in the Arctic btw... 
9241 2018-10-09 08:01:47 im all for the end of oil, but we need more charging stations, i road trip often there no charging stations between auckland and wellington (1 in hamilton) thats just sad.
9242 2018-10-09 08:01:46 Always oil first because it can take much higher temperature. Once the mushrooms are starting to look finished, then add the butter.

9336 2018-10-09 07:47:56 Meat should be produced on land that can not be cropped easily. Mankind also needs clothing, natural fibres such as fire proof wool (a buy product) should replace more oil based man made fibres. Planting trees is such an easy popular idea rooted in dogma not science.
9337 2018-10-09 07:47:54 Good point, but plastic is made from the by product of oil refinement. Until a suitable replacement for liquid fuel is found, nothing will change. And electric cars are not the answer due to mining of the metals needed.

9364 2018-10-09 07:44:13 Right now we are de facto using income taxes, USC etc. to support continued burning of peat, oil, coal and gas.

9368 2018-10-09 07:42:27 BTW, what happened to those BAJILLION DOLLARS worth of oil fields we found along the coast of Balochistan? Have they gone down the $500B Gold reserves we found? Or the $700B copper ones?

They say 2litre cooking oil now cost $15 , man thats insane
People are only allowed to buy one beer per customer, like really?
We all thought that Mnangagwa guy was gonna bring change but why is he letting all this happen
Not fair
9372 2018-10-09 07:42:05 Definitely we are the richest agricultural nation in Africa. (we don't export any oil or gold unlike the others!)
9373 2018-10-09 07:41:57 This is so on point. Working on a lot of cars that have missed a lot of oil changes?

9375 2018-10-09 07:41:36 Odd that so many Muslim countries delight in having oil. Almost as if Muhammad's claim wasn't about oil at all...
9376 2018-10-09 07:41:26 I’m really worried that we are going to need  power. Are we? Can’t we replace all the oil and gas we use in this country with renewables? Does anyone know of any research they can point me at?
9377 2018-10-09 07:41:21 incompetent pmln and ppp govt's failed to take advantage of that oil pprice decrease

9380 2018-10-09 07:40:57 Never forget that initially it is engineers&researshers from nuclear industry and weapons labs,  oil prospection, car builders, militaries, who reproduced LENR and published. Fraternity of engineers is submitted to what works, not to beliefs. Sadly we are ignored today.

9387 2018-10-09 07:40:06 Pure robbery. Did this retailer order the cooking oil using us$, or he /she used RTGS. Thats the level of selfishness that is also putting UNDUE pressure on prices.

9389 2018-10-09 07:39:39 Snake oil !  Questionable editorial judgement by Today
9390 2018-10-09 07:39:29 I fondly remember the early 2000s when people were worried about peak oil causing the end of civilization by making it too expensive to get oil out of the ground.
9391 2018-10-09 07:39:23 Try CBD. If you live in an area with legalized cannabis you can get it in a dispensary, or order CBD hemp oil online. There are some very good, reliable & safe products available online & legal to ship to any state. Peace & stay safe!  :)
9392 2018-10-09 07:38:57 Russia's rouble opened higher on Tuesday, helped by stronger prices for its main export oil, as traders looking ahead to a finance ministry decision on whether to sell government OFZ bonds this week.
9393 2018-10-09 07:38:33 Come on now, you are better than this / at least you can do better than this. You understand how crude oil prices is determined, and dollar versus rand strength.
9394 2018-10-09 07:38:28 Typical of government. The oil companies give kickbacks to the politicians for the subsidies while additional taxes are passed on to consumers. American is a crony nation.
9395 2018-10-09 07:38:19 I do have lavender & tea tree oil though 
9396 2018-10-09 07:38:14 I have an oil too I use for the front door, I’ll try that

9406 2018-10-09 07:35:59 Sunflower cooking oil prices have shot up to encourage people to use healthier oils like olive oil #NickMangwanaChallenge
9407 2018-10-09 07:35:56 I think there is one thing Professor Andrews said that I think is contentious: "Hitler was a great military leader". I don't think he was, otherwise he wouldn't have pushed NE during Russian campaign rather than to the oil fields in the SE - @MikeStuchbery_ a little help?
9408 2018-10-09 07:35:43 I used oil. I prayed over it and went over each door and window. That has to be annoying dealing with that.

9415 2018-10-09 07:34:49 Trade never been a topic most Americans knew much about. 
Trump changed that.

9417 2018-10-09 07:34:27 The inability of governments to address climate change is the product of a political-economic system in which the people with most power are those least impacted, in which oil companies were until recently the largest firms.
9418 2018-10-09 07:34:15 Oh. Okay. Nope. How are loss making entities going to provide for a sovereign wealth fund? Malaysia's / Norway's / Saudi's are all predicated on their immense oil wealth. How are we going to fund that. Sir aap mujhay abhi se hi Rs. 100 bhej dein haha.

9425 2018-10-09 07:33:42 These are excuses. Naira is yet to appreciate by 1 kobo despite improved oil prices. Truth is, he has a very poor cabinet with no stars. Kachikwu was looking great but was quickly shutdown. No significant positive impact after a whole term. Mostly negative.
9426 2018-10-09 07:33:23 Only time will tell really. Perez ending the DNC ban on oil and gas industry donations isn't promising. Too many expect anyone not Bernie to pull an Obama with Me all.

Such a positive for the U.K. ?
9462 2018-10-09 07:26:33 Partly because Norway saved up money from their north sea oil and did not give it away to the rich in tax giveaways.  now proudly have one of the worlds largest sovereign wealth funds

9464 2018-10-09 07:26:18 It wasn’t because of the depletion of the  foreign reserves by the PDP administration or the fact that Nigeria was a mono economy and got affected by the global fall in oil prices? It wasn’t because $20billion got missing and $2.1billion was shared amongst PDP cronies?

9507 2018-10-09 07:19:44 More like he will direct them to destabilise the EU further in order to topple it. Putin doesn’t like EU sanctions on his oil and gas and he certainly doesn’t want another superpower on his doorstep. He prefers to negotiate with each single country weakened by the EU break-up.

9509 2018-10-09 07:19:29 But implying that I don't know anything about economics, and could benefit from Econ 101 because I somehow think supply and demand is the only factor that goes into oil prices certainly implies that you think my intellectual capacity is somehow lacking.

9515 2018-10-09 07:18:40 If d treasury was having $62b under OBJ, for God's sake, $29b under GEJ must be seen as a depleted or 'virtually empty' treasury in d face of d oil boom of over $120 per barrel of crude oil he even enjoyed!

9530 2018-10-09 07:16:00 Weird. Cement demand down double digits, electricity consumption down mid-single digits. How can non oil GDP grow?
9531 2018-10-09 07:15:47 So is that a good reason for hoarding cooking oil?
9532 2018-10-09 07:15:39 Indeed. I was also always quite taken with the "Bush and Blair just wanted Iraq's oil" stuff. As if it were for personal use.

9535 2018-10-09 07:15:18 Margins in petrol retail are extremely thin.  If input costs (basically oil prices in NZD terms) go up, and you don't put prices up, you lose money.  If you put prices up too much, in a competitive market someone else undercuts you and you lose business.
9536 2018-10-09 07:15:08 Seed for oil & protein powder etc basic press stuff so yes. Solid Energy set up a big one for rape seed, which is now used for food oils.

9554 2018-10-09 07:12:39 Long been fascinated by the events of 1973.This year was a kind of pivot point,like 1945 & 2001.

9595 2018-10-09 07:06:25 Socialism will get any nice country down.
Giving away money like water will do that to you. If the money dries up (in this case: oil prices go down) you don't have any reserves.

Having a bus driver with his head in the sand in office doesn't help either.

9597 2018-10-09 07:05:30 Lol! So Venezuela is not a country? I'll cite Venezuela because over 90% of it's revenue us from crude oil just like ours and it's foreign reserves was depleted like ours when crude oil price finally plunged. It's govt was as reckless as ours. You started the comparison not me.
9598 2018-10-09 07:05:23 Good point. I will rather vote for PMB than those with history of using power for self enrichment. Someone even gifted his girl friend an oil bloc in this nation. Others shared oil blocs amidst themselves to secure the livelihood of their 4th generations. CORRUPTION is evil

9622 2018-10-09 07:01:40 Appreciate that. India needs to take care of its self interest and we are entitled to buy the cheapest oil which Iran is supplying. It can be in rupees or as rice for oil. As long as there is no dollar payment, US sanctions should not apply.

9643 2018-10-09 06:59:15 Dear BBC. What makes you think  a fawning interview with Gwynneth Paltrow “not admitting fault” for Goop is news? Ads for snake oil merchants and promotion of #nutribollocks is not part of the BBC remit. Stop it or move it to RIP Off Britain
9644 2018-10-09 06:59:12 だいぶ巻を遡るからいまいち覚えてないんですけど無いかぁ。

9645 2018-10-09 06:59:00 Hate to say it but the last company I worked for paid nothing as they sent it all back to USA and now I work for a company that sends it all to Australia - there is hardly an oil based company that pays anything in  UK..... well my PAYE with extra tax to NATs

9647 2018-10-09 06:58:52 Well noted, even then comparison has to be with all oil importing countries ... and data is amazing ...

9649 2018-10-09 06:58:44 Poor twitter can't edit, so revise my initial overexcited tweet to this: good report, lets hope we actually have the oil!!
9650 2018-10-09 06:58:42 えぇ…。普通の服って言おうとしたけど、普通ってなんだってなったので具体的に述べたまで…

9652 2018-10-09 06:58:33 Exactly. That is my point. We are able to charge that low because the FG is swapping crude oil for refined petrol, thereby leading to loss of additional income. That notwithstanding, we then subsidise all our neighbouring countries, as we are charging less than half what they do.
9653 2018-10-09 06:58:19 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
9654 2018-10-09 06:58:16 @BBCBreakfast why are you giving this crackpot Gwyneth Paltrow air time peddling her unsubstantiated snake oil products? Lying about the fine for their claims about two products and Charlie let her off the hook? Poor.
9655 2018-10-09 06:58:09 いっぱい頼もう
9656 2018-10-09 06:58:00 It's not only their money but their ability to launder the oil money they get from the public into the pockets and agendas of the rich and powerful.
9657 2018-10-09 06:57:39 Also, real Texans shouldn't vote for a guy who takes oil industry money, then says climate change is a hoax. UN report says we have til 2030 to try to keep it at bay..Republicans are NOT what we need right now!!

9669 2018-10-09 06:56:15 It's not correct Goverment puts the money to invest in health, education, Infrastructure etc etc. Oil companies are looking for increased profits for their shareholders.

9673 2018-10-09 06:55:27 Sorry to see that @BBCBreakfast is giving free advertising time to the quackery and snake oil of Gwyneth Paltrow with no critical challenge.
9674 2018-10-09 06:55:03 It’s not just her Party. It’s the Democrats too! Both Parties are corporate Parties, funded by Wall St., Banking, Defense Contractors, Big Insurance, Big Corporation, Big Oil, Private Prisons, Big Polluters, etc etc. it’s precisely why we’re in this horrible mess.

9679 2018-10-09 06:54:26 Well, fair enough. Bottomline Kenyan media should start running life transforming stories & explaining to citizens about how oil exploration in the fields of Turkana & Mining activities in the gold mines of Ikolomani et al can change their lives to the better.

9685 2018-10-09 06:54:02 Is oil price not a determinant of allocation to states? And are there no alternatives? Are you actually in this country?
9686 2018-10-09 06:53:54 It's cheaper to buy crude oil than buy cooking oil. Besides they have capacity to crush and harvest crude oil from soya, peanuts or sunflower but we ain't got the seed.

3 Construction, digital economy, education & healthcare as factors of growth 
4 Claims his govt motto will be "people are new oil"
9690 2018-10-09 06:53:37 Yes please add it to the other recipes in this thread...also like it roasted in olive oil but we have so much this year we'll have to try something else as well.
9691 2018-10-09 06:53:34 PMO have to step in directly now for - USD, Oil price and finding root cause of similar issues created in BJP ruled states. Time to need put best minds on work.

9708 2018-10-09 06:51:48 so amazed and grateful for having the opportunity to learn so much about the oil and gas industry! My team is so cool 
9709 2018-10-09 06:51:33 CRUDE OIL has bounced off 73.20 USD and moved higher to 74.70 USD per barrel. The MARKET is really BULLISH now, we are expecting it to move further.

9712 2018-10-09 06:50:47 Buying cooking oil at $10 is evidence enough that things are not well. Do I need to run a tucks hop kuona kuti fuel hapana pa service station do I need a tuckshop kuona kuti ma shops akavhara ne kuda kwe runaway inflation.  Mr gutu let's respect each other

9724 2018-10-09 06:48:46 It being turned into a political subject from day one by oil lobbies. A general misplaced trust that we have that *someone* is probably doing *something*. And a lack of giving a single fuck about things once we're not involved anymore. And Capitalism. Always Capitalism.

9731 2018-10-09 06:47:38 I disagree with your take. If US remained impartial, Japan would have had oil, so no Pearl Harbor, so they turn their attentions to USSR, plus no cash & carry / lend-lease leads to UK falling, & potentially China and USSR who also benefitted from Lend-Lease & now have no ally

9802 2018-10-09 06:37:33 Was it a bogus forecast? Oil prices were high at the time, how could they or any other party predict a crash in the price? Surely best numbers are used when making a case for anything. Did anyone expect the 2008 crash?

9924 2018-10-09 06:16:32 Interesting. I imagine the carcinogenic aspect in combination with the neuron-altering part of the plant can't be good for the gut. A lot of people where I live are turning to CBD oil and getting relief without the side effects. Hope there is more research.
9925 2018-10-09 06:16:31 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, or years.

9938 2018-10-09 06:14:02 A final thought for this evening, now that I’m on a serious note. Wa state initiative 1631: yes, it is a tax on emissions. Yes, all consumers of carbon emissions will be taxed. But look at who funds those anti-1631 commercials. All the big oil companies! Look carefully everyone.
9939 2018-10-09 06:13:48 They process from soya but it may be cheaper to import crude oil and refining. Consider if those companies that refine Brent Crude aren’t considered to be manufacturing

9946 2018-10-09 06:12:52 It is good news indeed, probably the beginning of an RFMO like institution too.

Just a pity that no mention nor intention to protect from other human impact activities such as mining or oil drilling. 

Why protection still is segmented? Why not have done all at once?

9952 2018-10-09 06:11:02 For example, the NATO has a far larger impact on climate change than any of the listed companies, since NATO buys oil and diesel from multiple companies, burns that fuel, plus uses several million tons of paper for documents every year. It's easy to write horror stories tbh.

2) Get drunk off the beer.
3) Make the damn crepes.

9968 2018-10-09 06:07:49 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
9969 2018-10-09 06:07:12 It’s a mix. We crush local beans (60,000mt this year), import soya from Zambia and Malawi...the Crude is because Zim doesn’t allow the importation of GMO. This leaves crude oil as the only import option. There is 400,000mt of installed soya crushing capacity.
9970 2018-10-09 06:07:12 Environment Minister the Hon. Melissa Price worked as a lawyer for a consultant to mining & oil companies, advising on getting around environment laws.

Wonder no longer why she’s not interested in reading the IPCC report, or why she’s so besotted with burning coal.

9980 2018-10-09 06:05:57 Why are we importing crude cooking oil in the first place. We had a 'successful' command agric season under the wise leadership of His Excellency ED. We can't process our own soya bean, ground nuts, sunflowers etc into cooking oil. Indeed it's a new dispensation of Ediocy.

9985 2018-10-09 06:04:08 If you went on the parallel market to import 2L of oil you would be $6.80. Just so you know.
9986 2018-10-09 06:04:05 Between the 2, it’s clear as day on who is right. Thanks @SecSonnySays for finally getting this done! We only have to worry about oil now that the self-inflicted rice crisis is solved with this lasting solution that’s a win for most Filipinos and the government.

10007 2018-10-09 06:00:27 You didn’t ask for advice, but if you don’t mind me offering some - use oil paints for shading - you’ll get a cleaner result and a longer drying time for blending effects. I’ve painted full time for a decade now, oil paints revolutionised the last few years of that! Good luck!
