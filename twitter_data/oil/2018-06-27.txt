42 2018-06-27 23:55:44 Imo not a red flag. Cronos also has said it doesn’t make sense. Let’s say you are making oils. You make 2 g of weed. One with 10% thc one with 20%. Which will make you more oil? All grams are not equal. How much cost per thc/cbd content makes more sense when talking oils.

54 2018-06-27 23:54:14 Got to give it to foxnews as well, they cleverly went soft on Bernie because they saw him for what he was, a lefty demagogue dividing the D coalition w his *magic* fast change revolution snake oil. He couldn’t even convince a majority of his own progressive causus to back him.
55 2018-06-27 23:54:13 I thought that was a 9th circuit ruling?
56 2018-06-27 23:54:13 Putin has oil and all the European countries don’t. That’s why good relationships are so important to the GOP right now with China and Norway already switching to EV’s.
57 2018-06-27 23:54:01 The US gov't can't impose a travel ban on the Saudis because everyone knows the Saudis can just stop selling oil for a year and bring the US to its knees.

Which I'm all for, given that Canada exports most of its oil to the US and we could use this get some better trade leverage.
58 2018-06-27 23:53:58 Might I add, treating on an outpatient basis would be the more conservative approach.

67 2018-06-27 23:52:06 Yeah my family worked on some of those too (brothers, brother in law). I support pipelines but we needed a new approach to them. Harper ruined the reputation of that industry and absolutely never could have gotten one built across BC today. Kenney is oil's saviour? Lol.

94 2018-06-27 23:48:27 Bullet is just fancy marketed keto from quick google, used to sell overpriced coffee beans n mct oil. Keto makes it hard to get fiber. High protein means more kidney stones. Not sure long term effects on organs
95 2018-06-27 23:48:24 i think you're missing the fact that the gunplay/ADS/camera was never fixed and there is no standardized FOV so no one knows if they are missing because they missed or if its because the game fucked up. There is too much snake oil for anyone to know why they are fucking up
96 2018-06-27 23:48:24 the beauty of it is that you have deluded yourselves into thinking theres something to know. its a game of brain damaged kids with a pointy ball whose success is predicated soley on the quality of opponent & circumstance. your quasi-science is utter snake oil.

156 2018-06-27 23:40:48 It's a coordinated effort to keep us focused on an immigration debate, including ICE Trump will try to spin w/patriotic sentiment and the recent "Muslim" national security ban for his base, while Russia benefits w/increased oil output to fill Iran vacuum & Russia helps Trump/GOP

167 2018-06-27 23:39:26 Why aren't you & the PM saying no to Keystone, a pipeline that supplies USA with jobs & decades of cheap Canadian oil? Why not work together with First Nations, municipalities, Gov't of Quebec & industry to proceed with EE, adding jobs & value to Canadian oil, not conflict oil?
168 2018-06-27 23:38:42 You damn sure don’t have to pay for fuel anymore, you ignore the ridiculous rise in oil prices.

195 2018-06-27 23:34:57 So sad.I know how hopeless you feel. Maybe you can be happy for others: vets who have better health care, or the families of our service personnel who no longer have to count on welfare or food pantries, or even Blacks who have the lowest unemployed ever. Feel better now?
196 2018-06-27 23:34:56 My mema: they sell that marijuana oil now and I heard it helps with arthritis so I’m gonna get some! I’ll let you know if I wanna share.
197 2018-06-27 23:34:50 No correlation, sir. Oil prices rose without any influence of Trumps tax cuts.
198 2018-06-27 23:34:36 Here are some ideas--don't ban gas and oil production, run a more efficient government and set your province up for more investment and less aid from Alberta.

201 2018-06-27 23:34:13 Trump will go down in history as the man who not only snatched, traumatized and lost innocent children, but the one who sold snake oil to his people to become a fascist and the GOP  as spineless cowards that allowed it to happen.
202 2018-06-27 23:34:11 So Dawn dish soap works to get oil off of animals but I am having some issues getting parmesan cheese off of a fork. Am I doing it wrong?
203 2018-06-27 23:34:11 Dry skin has no chance with this bath oil! Apricot, almond and sunflower oils give thirsty skin just what it needs.

205 2018-06-27 23:34:00 Lotta micromanagers in this fan base. Is the bullpen stuff questionable? Sure, but it's a loong season. It'll get figured out. 162 games... Not six
206 2018-06-27 23:33:53 Still working to lower my husband's triglycerides which are now down to 202 - it's too high - what more can we do to lower it? Cut Avocado oil to minimal, eating Chia porridge daily w/ a few berries, grass fed beef & lamb, little chicken, eggs, cheese, coffee, water, asparagus
207 2018-06-27 23:33:49 There is such thing as too much coconut oil.

210 2018-06-27 23:33:01 I see how people get sold snake oil.  I’d do anything to get my neck to stop hurting about now.
211 2018-06-27 23:32:59 Watching #QueerEye while completely coated with CBD oil inside and out is the only way I’m keeping it together in this administration tbh
212 2018-06-27 23:32:34 Just two months after the start of the war.

My point being that oil interests at least played some role in the maneuver to oust Saddam, that was foisted on the backs of a public and government that was still reeling from 9/11 and wanting answers.
213 2018-06-27 23:32:19 After dropping the sesame oil, you might as well throw down a bottle of soy sauce, fish sauce, and stomp some garlic and ginger.  You got to have balance.
214 2018-06-27 23:32:13 I get oil changes on the regular booboo
215 2018-06-27 23:32:05 Lolol Nah just cuz the dough aint grazed with some oil like they do at dominio’s and it’s a little dry don’t mean it ain’t good dough/bread  real margherita pizzas be like that!

217 2018-06-27 23:31:56 I think Turkey sticks it out to prove a point

Interesting to see where China turns to if they stop buying oil from Iran .. maybe be the savior for Venezuela in exchange for many pounds of flesh in the future?

Iran revolt will have far reaching effects around the globe

220 2018-06-27 23:31:25 Potential is worthless. Knowledge is worthless. Ideas are worthless...

In the same way that crude oil is worthless.

If you don't transform it into something useful then it is, by definition, a waste.
221 2018-06-27 23:31:20 HD even has their sheep thinking that they NEED to buy only genuine HD parts and oil! Everything they make is over priced. They do not even hold their value like years past. You can buy an entry level Sporty one year for 11-12K, give you 5K the next yr towards a bigger bike! SAD!
222 2018-06-27 23:31:16 Yikes. I despise Trump, but I have -some- compassion for the people who believed his lies. He's a snake oil salesman & they bought it. I don't wish anyone losing their jobs & not being able to feed/clothe/shelter their family...not even Trumpsters. Well...maybe the alt-right. lol
223 2018-06-27 23:31:15 Whether this was the goal all along or just vulturous byproduct of oil companies isn't fully clear, but a 2001 task force report by the National Policy Development Group (funded by big oil) came to the conclusion that the Middle East must open up its resources to the world.
224 2018-06-27 23:31:03 Condiments on chips are so pointless. The whole point is that the oil and seasoning give it flavour. McDonalds used beef fat, Five Guys peanut oil. Either make it a dish(Chili fries / Poutine) or just eat them. Vinegar is the only condiment acceptable.
225 2018-06-27 23:31:01 The foolish had some oil in their lamps, but not enough, since they were running out around midnight. Why do you think they didn’t bring enough?
226 2018-06-27 23:30:48 @Food_Unwrapped How about an episode on pet food? Lilly's kitchen cat is 65% meat, salmon oil & chelated minerals. But apparently only has 5.5% oils/fats. What actually goes into it? Is it better for them to have corned beef/tuna? I'd be interested to know.
227 2018-06-27 23:30:44 You’re more ambitious than me. I just got the oil changed in my Jeep

234 2018-06-27 23:30:03 Ahhhh, now I didn't say it was more important than transition,  I said it was Greenpeace at work.
I also said that the filth left behind shows the hypocrisy that most protesters share.
I also said that oil and gas plays an important part in our lives.

245 2018-06-27 23:28:37 Calgary is a big oil town. Lots of Americans live there. It's gross. Also it's barely a city. Whole town rolls up @ 5pm. My partner has to travel there for work a fair bit. It's super conservative + just really awful. #JustSayNo!

256 2018-06-27 23:26:51 This tweet is why Trump win. Remember your overacting is ridiculous and comparisons to Nazi camps shows your insanity. Get a grip man. Where was your outrage over Syria a fake war for oil?
257 2018-06-27 23:26:48 American Century: 

In the 1900’s through WWI, nearly 80% of Europe’s oil was imported from America. Oil was discovered in the Middle East but the quantities were unknown. America produced 140 times more oil than Iran (Persia at the time).

259 2018-06-27 23:26:41 less is more!! Don’t use aggressive products for your acne. If your skin is oily don’t use products with oil. For me tea tree soup, rose water and moilmoisturizing is the most important
260 2018-06-27 23:26:31 Olive oil heals the soul.

266 2018-06-27 23:25:28 read ingredients lists!!! If it contains palm oil and you buy it, you personally are contributing to the habitat loss and population decline of orangutans!!!!!!!!
267 2018-06-27 23:25:23 The decision to go to war w/ Iraq on flimsy evidence is just odd, compared to the fact that Bush's staff (headed mostly by Cheney) met, frequently, with oil execs before and during the war on Iraq to discuss post-war Iraq's postwar industry.
268 2018-06-27 23:25:22 CV, Considering Oil supply without Venezuela and Iran 72-76 is Predictable! Argentina can double their output with these prices!
269 2018-06-27 23:25:19 Well for those that can’t tolerate peanut butter yes. My best friend Dave was arranging for Ray Charles and somebody use peanut butter oil and his salad. It was not fun. But I love peanut butter

274 2018-06-27 23:24:39 They aren’t impoverished today. They were under rule before Chavez. All of the money they got from oil went OUT of the country. What you see now is not from socialism. It’s from antisocialism trying to bring down the government. No different than Libya

284 2018-06-27 23:23:13 Xle trading where it was last December when oil was around 61
285 2018-06-27 23:23:12 Oh. Is that how it works now? We can just demand that someone work against his will?
286 2018-06-27 23:23:05 #Cdnpoli also has to ask Poloz why he moved to neutral in the fall of 2013 when the oil patch was booming. Why was it appropriate to throw fuel on the fire?
287 2018-06-27 23:22:54 Just paid 113$ for an oil change. An oil change..
288 2018-06-27 23:22:49 Be worried when the farts stop. Baby constipation isn't fun. Dill oil helps and you get the side benefit of the baby smelling like pickles.

But why don't you try blaming us, your readers.   We're driving around in SUVs*, and oil companies supply us the fuel to do so.

*Not me, of course.   I'm riding in a gas guzzling old sedan, with an occasional hop on the bus.

299 2018-06-27 23:21:28 Some 84% of North Dakota's exports - oil, front loaders, ethyl alcohol & wheat is exported to Canada. The state imports 54% from Canada.
300 2018-06-27 23:21:28 In things you all need to know news: this foot cream has tea tree oil in it and my feet feel all tingly and it's great
301 2018-06-27 23:21:22 American interests in the middle east have been fueled by five major factors: Israel, cold war alignment, islamic terrorism, nuclear nonproliferation, and oil. How much oil played a part in it isn't fully clear, opinions obviously differ from person to person, but.
302 2018-06-27 23:21:14 Lemon juice or baby oil. Baking soda helps too. Trust me, I would know
303 2018-06-27 23:21:08 Perhaps save on expenses, the donuts and fries are cooked in the same oil.
304 2018-06-27 23:21:07 You 2nd Amendment types are sooooooo clueless! Read the rest of the Constitution especially Art. V, to see how the 2nd Amendment isn't going anywhere! Sheesh! I think that gun oil makes you guys Cray-Cray!

306 2018-06-27 23:21:01 I can't give you a detailed explanation buy I can give you an example 

Like: you can't mix a Russian and American / you can't mix oil and water/ you can't mix Christian and Muslim
Nigeria can't just mix together. They can't tolerate the existence of one anoth
307 2018-06-27 23:21:01 oil that is
308 2018-06-27 23:20:59 Little simple marinade for pan seared fish :

Olive oil 
Lemon zest & juice 
White wine 
Fresh garlic 
Sea salt 
Pepper
309 2018-06-27 23:20:29 Not old school, just an ACTUAL small "c" conservative.

CPC = neocons at best.

I'm down with disruptive tech making oil obsolete. I just believe that process should take its own course. Government cannot force it along.
310 2018-06-27 23:20:25 Getting real tired of wiping oil hand prints off my new paint from these dumbass mechanics
311 2018-06-27 23:20:17 Via email, Paul LePage boldly informs Katrina Pierson that Russian officials are drilling for oil. Tucker Carlson snorts a few lines.
312 2018-06-27 23:20:16 Yup, we all know how much the Oilers love ex Oil Kings.
313 2018-06-27 23:20:09 What's the psi? If it sits for any long length of time you'll have to change the oil. It's not hard. Just an annoyance. I had a side pressure business years ago
314 2018-06-27 23:20:02 Bible verse you used to pray too.. ?
Did you use anointing oil? 

What music was playing as you prayed?
Was fasting involved?
315 2018-06-27 23:19:36 Take Putin’s failed economic agenda as an example. The fact the US is now governed by a conman who seeks to raise oil prices doesn’t make Putin’s failure to invest in the future sound.
316 2018-06-27 23:19:31 For starters, because Venezuela is “Democratic Socialist” exactly like Bernie and the izquierda nuevo “Democratic Socialist” Latina in New York. Venezuela collapsed under the weight of Chavez’s 21st Century socialism BEFORE the fall in oil prices.

318 2018-06-27 23:19:20 Drain the swamp? Last time I checked inviting Goldman Sachs and big oil to the Whitehouse wasn't draining the swamp, it was filling it up! How many lies can the "Trump train" carry?! ;)
319 2018-06-27 23:19:19 America can cause a recession in Canada but can cause total economic failure in countries like Iran, so they people begin to say regime change is needed because it’s what the United States wants, I was hoping other countries would begin to go to Iran for oil & save the deal

325 2018-06-27 23:18:20 I’m sorry your son is having these difficulties. What worked for us was getting inflammation down with EPA fish oil and giving nootropics. Vinpocetine, piracetam, and nicotine. Each did something to help his speech.
326 2018-06-27 23:18:18 Just throw a little bit more oil drilling into the mix for Murkowski  and she will vote for whoever Trump wants.
327 2018-06-27 23:18:14 tried CBD oil today and it was a diluted batch but worked nonetheless... curious what a stronger batch would feel like. i could totally see how this helps people with anxiety and with stress.

No one has given ANY credible evidence of a GSM, no one at all! Pure snake oil is all it is! Globe is warming.

336 2018-06-27 23:15:35 It’s vegan at most sporting events too! The “butter” is usually made with coconut oil
337 2018-06-27 23:15:19 Thank you for standing with me – and with thousands of people all across the country – in telling Congress "no oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge!" Jeff Merkley
338 2018-06-27 23:15:14 #tytlive When @Ocasio2018 walks into Congress she will have no debt.
 She won't owe Big Pharma.
 She won't owe the Big Banks.
 She won't owe the Oil Conglomerates.
 The only people she'll have allegiance to is the people she serves.
That's the way things were supposed to be.
339 2018-06-27 23:15:07 Yeah, well when you've gotten to his age and the pinnacle of your career thus far is oil changes at Pennzoil that accounts for the jealousy over a smarter, better spoken young man on his way up in the world. Rock on CJ!
340 2018-06-27 23:15:06 Maybe she gets her notes from Jeffrey Toobin? Many people like to refer to #JeffreyToobin as "Lubin Toobin" cuz he looks like the guy giving quick oil changes at Jiffy Lube. & it Nicely rhymes too. Fun to say. People would like Toobin to work at Juffy Lube instead of #CNN
341 2018-06-27 23:15:04 Menengai Oil. Bidco Oil. I wonder if they manufacture in Kenya? Nope. Oil is also imported and repackaged. Reason we are a poor nation is that we hardly produce anything!
342 2018-06-27 23:15:00 i have had chronic athlete's foot for over 2 years which I desperately try fighting w/ tea tree oil soap, baking soda in water, washing my feet 3 times a day, etc.

347 2018-06-27 23:13:50 Riddle me this....the FO promoted both Evan Phillips and Wes Parsons for having fresh arms and Brian Snitker still used the same overused RP’s allowing Phillips and Parsons to be sent back without using them and making our own even more overused. That’s perfectly fine?
348 2018-06-27 23:13:43 Difficult to say. Our article reports on how Multi-well pad drilling is allowing companies to produce oil more efficiently and at a significant cost savings for shale oil producers. Obviously shale oil production is only a small part in the oil price economics.
349 2018-06-27 23:13:38 going  oil change at 8am
350 2018-06-27 23:13:30 Imagine that
 a winsome honey blonde ISFP oil heiress,
 haltingly tearing the seams of a blue denim vest,
 makes a fire offering to Ēostre under the watchful eyes of a
 white-blotched chestnut brown Isabella horse.

354 2018-06-27 23:13:04 I'm feeling ya GYRL. The bug hit me hard when I was real little watching flattrack 2strokes slide around the oval. The smell of the oil mixed with the gasoline was intoxicating as the sound of the engines hypnotized me like the sirens of Titan calling sailors on the high seas.
355 2018-06-27 23:12:49 Indeed!  Enjoy!  
Note: Because there is far less oil/butter than other recipes, the cake is a bit more dense.
356 2018-06-27 23:12:42 Ahhh.abangers sa ta ani. 
357 2018-06-27 23:12:36 Meanwhile... the “peaceful” death cult has been responsible for that since the beginning ! Christians would have never had hung up pictures/oil paintings  of the Old Testament in their living rooms throughout history if they actually felt Jews were evil !
358 2018-06-27 23:12:25 i'm not saying CBD oil is magic but CBD oil is magic

360 2018-06-27 23:12:21 You won’t ever find me paying someone to do small work on my car. Or maintenance.
How the fuck do men these days don’t know how to change some oil. Or tune up your car.. fuck is wrong with y’all.
361 2018-06-27 23:12:17 Probably
362 2018-06-27 23:11:59 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.

365 2018-06-27 23:11:17 I forgot how fye Avon bath oil smells
366 2018-06-27 23:11:16 The US wants two things. To punish Venezuela for Chavez (huge anti American guy) and the oil to back in American control. The FourHorsemen and their (US) Army never sleep

376 2018-06-27 23:10:30 First question #Cdnpoli has to ask Poloz, why was he so concerned about the fall in oil in 2015, but he and @bankofcanada actually went looser when it was soaring in 2013? Do you think politics had anything to do with it?
377 2018-06-27 23:10:17 Like oil and water. How can you vote for a person, party who in turn takes away your individual liberty for collective social justice? Their idea of spreading the wealth ends up with them being wealthy.

380 2018-06-27 23:10:02 It is time for Justice Ginsburg to retire gracefully, and enjoy her retirement...the rest of us will enjoy it more.
381 2018-06-27 23:09:59 She needs to be forced to retire.

390 2018-06-27 23:08:44 J.P. burning midnight oil finishing the album covers. It’s a big job, the booklet has 30 pages of photos and stories  #celticmusic #sliotarmusic
391 2018-06-27 23:08:43 You chased the almighty $ when oil prices were high and went into a cyclical job that is reliant on the price of oil. The woe is me card is pathetic. You control your future, you’re biggest complaint has been lack of bonus and boot allowance
392 2018-06-27 23:08:41 I spilled a massive container of bean salad all over my parents' floor. Kidney beans under the dishwasher, chickpeas under the fridge, olive oil everywhere.  I will never forget the horror.
393 2018-06-27 23:08:26 You know as well as anyone that these stock photos are generally used to push garbage and snake oil remedies on clickbait feeds. They prey on the uninformed and hopeless, be it debt relief schemes, cures for illness, promises of wealth, or other frauds. That’s where the story is.
394 2018-06-27 23:08:02 I think the plane ruined my ouai hair oil and I’m a little mad about it tbh

397 2018-06-27 23:07:51 Because of their radicalism, dems went from a 60-40 majority in the Senate in 2010 to the minority in 4 years. Actions have consequences—like not having enough votes to get your SC nominee to the floor of the Senate.

402 2018-06-27 23:07:29 Just remember, if you want to enjoy it you will need to cleanse the oils from your tongue after each bite. A nice starch to absorb the oil followed by an acid to cut it would work great!
A5, steamed jasmine rice, heirloom tomato, rice? Repeat until done.
403 2018-06-27 23:07:19 Have you tried peppermint essential oil in a diffuser? I went almost a month without a migraine when I had them at least twice a week before. Lavendar also helps a bit.

433 2018-06-27 23:02:10 It’s the same thing we did in Chile. The purpose of our interaction is simply install a fake ruler there who does what the US oil interests want

443 2018-06-27 23:01:07 ''Sex isn't work'' apparently.

Getting naked & simulating sex to be watched by cinema audiences.
Arresting & incarcerating sex workers for working.

448 2018-06-27 23:00:31 you’re taking actual fish oil supplements?? In 2018??? Dude please go get some hemp seeds or flax seeds. way more cost effective and you’re not ingesting toxic metals stored in processed fish flesh 
449 2018-06-27 23:00:30 Idiot! People are dying everyday from capitalist interests. Wars are being fought. Peace treaties (Iran for instance) are being quashed to suit oil prices and big businesses. Nationalization is the key to driving a workforce. We don’t need a strong economy but a stable workforce.

455 2018-06-27 23:00:00 But he’s totally fine with borrowing trillions of dollars from China to buy oil from Saudi Arabia. Those are both great places that treat their people with respect and dignity.
456 2018-06-27 22:59:57 Exactly! Plus, nothing some good olive oil can't fix!

458 2018-06-27 22:59:45 I found a Natural Recipe! In a Spray bottle use 10 drops of Tea Tree Oil or Eucalyptus with water, or use a pint of Vinegar 2 ounce Baby Oil a Squirt of Dish Soap in a Spray Bottle! Supposed to repel Horseflies! Hope that helps you!

471 2018-06-27 22:57:43 Oil is the backbone and the heart of the very concept of civilization. Without oil we revert back to wiping our ass with our left and and chucking rock with the right.
472 2018-06-27 22:57:28 Wait, so you now need oil to make fuel right? Or also to make tanks, planes etc?

487 2018-06-27 22:55:51 It's ridiculous. No human being can look like that in the long term, and the self tan and baby oil makes them look even more idiotic. Fasting and then not drinking for a more defined look is dangerous too.
488 2018-06-27 22:55:42 And if you think about it, it makes sense. I mean farmers have chewed coca leaves forever. It wasn't until man purified it into cocaine that it was an issue. Olives are awesome. Olive oil, on the other hand, impairs arterial function.

493 2018-06-27 22:55:10 CBD oil is a great product that has changed many lives including mine.  The product i sell is the purest on the market with no added fillers or chemicals.  Id love to chat if you are still interested.
494 2018-06-27 22:54:45 Holy f*ck. I’m actually in complete agreement with you. You must be an old school Conservative. 
We still have oil and demand is expected to rise - I just doubt we have 60 years of windfall left. Disruptive tech could flatten the industry/demand too.
495 2018-06-27 22:54:45 Maybe she has sleep apnea.

502 2018-06-27 22:53:50 So Ontario Auto industry is worried bout Trumps 25 ‘/, tariffs. 
Well there’s no oil pipeline from Alberta to Ontario so keep buying your tanker oil from USA...who are Alberta’s only oil customer due to no pipeline east. Crazy - oil/gas are bad & cars are good. How does it feel
503 2018-06-27 22:53:47 Believe me and has it's benefits as well. Don't go for the frankinsense stick options, they are actually harmfull, only essential oil of good Quality, not those cheap immitations that mix it with dangerous chemicals

507 2018-06-27 22:53:34 Thanks LOL, good to learn new acronyms. Yes CBD Brothers have a great reputation. It's about finding the right oil for you. My daughter has very severe nausea 24/7, but CBD has helped. Although we do use POM on her worst days. 
508 2018-06-27 22:53:07 Sorry but then you have no ingenuity to differentiate between a good and a great game.
509 2018-06-27 22:53:06 Came across a reddit thread where a dumb trader went short on oil for a quick flip and loses 20K. Well deserved loss for failing to do full due diligence on geo-politics and trumps trade war. Get ready for more losses LUL.
510 2018-06-27 22:52:31 How can palm oil be both "ecologically disastrous" and "here to stay" at the same time? That's industry hype and a completely defeatist approach.
511 2018-06-27 22:52:17 @PM_AbiyAhmed We are sure that unless the Ogaden problem is resolved and a mutually beneficial agreement put in place for the benefit of the Ogaden populace, oil and natural gas prospecting will always remain in peril and an exercise in futility.
512 2018-06-27 22:52:14 Wheatgrass is great for those who aren't intolerant. Buy it once with roots intact, put in soil in a tray, don't let soil get moldy, & you're good, just "mow" it with scissors & add raw to meals after they're cooked.

514 2018-06-27 22:52:13 Babassu oil is like coconut oils cousin they’re similar in benefits but what makes it better is it absorbs faster, it’s light weight and not greasy, and it doesn’t CLOG your pores like coconut oil which is a major drawback
515 2018-06-27 22:52:10 To be able to sleep like a baby i recommend frankinsense essential oil with a device to dissipate it in the room.

524 2018-06-27 22:51:05 Usually I would say yes as they generally track the market. The issues I have are 1) Oil doesn't look to be going lower any time soon and 2) These energy stocks are so undervalued that I just don't see much downside, not to mention that they outperformed the market again today.
525 2018-06-27 22:50:53 Did you know:
Oil comes from the soil hence

Gas comes from the ass hence gass
526 2018-06-27 22:50:28 Me too love :( try running hot water under the bottom of the spoon and then place that on your bumps. Also try tea tree oil, it works wonders!
527 2018-06-27 22:50:24 @cbdbrothers are going to send me a sample of their oil as I’ve heard great things about theirs. POM is prescription only medicine (sorry for the acronym)
528 2018-06-27 22:50:05 Clean energy LOL why is it that clean energy needs oil to make it? Why is it clean energy is only something the rich can afford? Why is it that theres  zero transparency where carbon-tax monies r directed to? No answers are what the left always has.

544 2018-06-27 22:47:18 how to get rid of dandruff
what is dandruff? dandruff is a skin condition that mainly affects the scalp. 

what causes dandruff? 
oil from the scalp causes skin cells to mush together and cause flakes. 

545 2018-06-27 22:47:18 Manufacturing, skilled trades, tech, health care, retail, construction, oil/gas/mining, lumber...sheesh...every sector.  Just check indeed job boards in every state!
546 2018-06-27 22:47:16 What the @UN has been doing is like Highwaymen in #Marib - #Yemen.!

Whenever they were broke, they used to explode the oil pipelines passing in their villages and prevent the #Yemen government of fixing them till the government gave them the amount they want.!

554 2018-06-27 22:46:15 ever lost money learning how to cook oil base???
555 2018-06-27 22:46:15 She wants powerful foreign countries to impose financial sanctions on us, try to take over U.S. oil & gas production for their profit & isolate us on the internationl stage?
556 2018-06-27 22:45:55 It’s not a gravy train, we deserve to get paid that .well. Oil can be cyclical, but oil companies invest based on the producing life of a well, which covers several booms and busts. Worst recession since the depression hits, and they tax and regulate the shit outta the industry.
557 2018-06-27 22:45:54 Everything she says is fake news. If she was serious about the environment she would stop all oil sands production. The havoc it is reeking on our environment is horrendous
558 2018-06-27 22:45:51 How do people still smell like they just stepped out the shower at 5pm? Am I missing something? Is there an oil based fragrance out called 'Just Showered' by Clinique? #lookingforanswers

598 2018-06-27 22:40:09 Almost 84% of North Dakota's exports - oil, front loaders, ethyl alcohol, & wheat end up in Canada. The state imports 54% from Canada.

606 2018-06-27 22:39:19 You don’t know me, you have no clue of my values. One example was his lack of action when the SR water protectors were under attack by a bunch of oil bought sheriffs. I was furious, but you know me, right? Don’t call me a fucking liar when you believe every lie that trump spews.
607 2018-06-27 22:38:49 me he comprado castor oil para que me crezcan las pestañas y el brow tint de maybelline its over for yall bitches

618 2018-06-27 22:37:15 This happened to us but it was with a jar of fish oil. We should have burned that shit down. The pantry never smelled the same.
619 2018-06-27 22:37:15 Woo hoo, Franklin Country Club! She inherited her family oil co., never worked for anything in her life, out of touch with the majority of Americans and only seeking self-enrichment and power.  I despise her.
620 2018-06-27 22:37:14 You understand that Russia opposes US oil development, right?
621 2018-06-27 22:37:00 Lots of great oil and gas charts out there,  I'm bullish
622 2018-06-27 22:36:53 ‘Leaf or oil?’, neither, a big ol’ 9 bar with tonnes of plastic in it. Kids these days.... #toptable

624 2018-06-27 22:36:34 Many states, weapon exporters and oil companies (which are stealing syrian oil at the golan f.e.) want the syrian tragedy to continue. BUT more and more rebels switch side to their multireligious brothers in the SAA and fight the takfiri together. SYRIA WILL WIN - WAR WILL END!

628 2018-06-27 22:36:11 Dinosaurs Thrived for 150million years, in a 1600-7000ppm C02 environment, Today its just 380ppm.  Alberta was once a subtropical climate. then submerged under a mile of ice.  We do have to stop squandering the Oil Mother Earth gave us. Global Warming? Thats Mother Natures job.
629 2018-06-27 22:36:05 yes, Thank God the democrats that supported that evil system are dead and gone.
I suppose you must miss it, which is why democrats are trying so hard to return us to that time.

631 2018-06-27 22:35:51 Anyway to have admiral Ronnie Jackson give her the same physical and competency test Trump took earlier this year
632 2018-06-27 22:35:41 coconut oil is weird
633 2018-06-27 22:35:36 watch what the refiners and oil companies do not what the government says. india imports are going to come way down.
634 2018-06-27 22:35:31 Don't worry - 9th Circuit always gets overturned by Supreme Ct  
635 2018-06-27 22:35:27 I only use olive oil. I live in olive country. I’m lucky.
636 2018-06-27 22:35:24 Trying to save time & money for your business in the oil industry? #RFID is making traction in the oil industry for valve tracking.
637 2018-06-27 22:35:17 Sure enough, lazy reporters turned to Big Oil shill McTeague for another baseless prediction.
638 2018-06-27 22:35:11 Kennedy really was a shot caller for better or worse.
639 2018-06-27 22:35:11 Kudos to the residents. I hope they demand for piped water, security, electricity, food security, better schools....all basic needs before any oil is extracted from their soil. Its is their right.. its not a favour!
640 2018-06-27 22:35:03 Getting burned by hot oil just like you would think it would.. hurts like a bitch
641 2018-06-27 22:35:01 Shout out to the niggaz with dirty fingernails. Not because he dirty but because oil I don't give a fuck bout your cuticles.
642 2018-06-27 22:34:53 This dr Simon Kukes Guy is an oil business magnate that’s paid off the $PED all debt owed, with his energy owned SK company(LLC) is driving the stock up crazy

645 2018-06-27 22:34:30 It flares back and forth, currently getting rid of one now. Treatments have changed all throughout but mostly working on gut with candida cleanse and Pepcid, colloidal silver, metro cream, recently sea berry oil helps a tonnnnn. Pure zinc mixed with water as a spot treatment.
646 2018-06-27 22:34:28 Who wanna pay for this $80 oil change
647 2018-06-27 22:34:24 So @hrw giving a platform to Nimmo, who works for the Atlantic Council, funded by US Govt, Gulf State Dictators, Big Oil, Military Industrial Complex.
648 2018-06-27 22:34:18 Have you tried Butters with our dildos any chance? I'm wonder how the oil based lube is reacting to our silicone.
649 2018-06-27 22:34:13 What the @UN has been doing is like Highwaymen in #Marib - #Yemen.!

Whenever they were broke, they used to explode the oil pipelines passing in their villages and prevent the #Yemen government of fixing them till our government gave them the amount they want.!

#shameonun
650 2018-06-27 22:34:11 I wanted one with no scent and saw in the ingredients that it has thyme oil and maybe one or two other things, can’t remember, but it just smells like little leafs 
651 2018-06-27 22:34:07 No place for #Adani anywhere. Not here. Not India. Not in the World with dodgy #Wilmar (Sugar) polluting Asia & destroying, Raping Indonesia & Orangutan habitat for Palm Oil. Greed lust men are driven no less than Pedophiles are. #Palaszczuk #Baker & Co are heinous Perpetrators.
652 2018-06-27 22:34:00 I need a oil change like SAP

654 2018-06-27 22:33:52 I've completely given up on skincare brands. Nothing seems to be working for me. My skin has been looking and feeling terrible. I'm currently using olive oil & my skin is already looking & feeling well. Mother nature to the rescue
655 2018-06-27 22:33:45 Is @RSPOtweets certified “sustainable” palm oil truly sustainable? If you think #landgrabbing is sustainable then yes. #EURT2018
656 2018-06-27 22:33:43 It's a good time to be alive!
657 2018-06-27 22:33:36 Trying out CBD oil
658 2018-06-27 22:33:18 How lucky Norway was to have had North Sea oil and been able to invest the proceeds.
What a pity we never had that in Britain.
659 2018-06-27 22:32:47 Yeah, that system has been dead and gone for about 5 1/2 decades now.
660 2018-06-27 22:32:44 We achieve the same results.  You with oil paint,  me with a needle and thread.  
661 2018-06-27 22:32:40 - Keep ya oil , I want de soil .

667 2018-06-27 22:32:03 The big money, international corporations, and multi-billionaires would HATE that. And, nationalizing our oil (and other resources) would put us on a similar path to Norway: imagine if we had a trillion bucks in the bank, instead of a trillion dollar national debt.

669 2018-06-27 22:31:39 #tytlive Seems Alito used the biggest buzz word for his opinion: subsidized. Tells me he's of that ilk who thinks it's okay to subsidize oil companies but not things like housing. That thinking then attacks unions for "subsidizing" their workers during a strike.
670 2018-06-27 22:31:30 Ole’ Maxine is a grifter. She presents herself as something she is not. She’s a snake oil salesman. She gets the crowd all worked up, and then they do her bidding which is called inciting violence.
671 2018-06-27 22:31:29 Need someone to come oil my scalp 
672 2018-06-27 22:31:19 Because, as I believe Yosemite Sam once famously said, “there’s oil in them thar hills, rabbit!”
673 2018-06-27 22:31:08 Oil demand will go down?
674 2018-06-27 22:31:01 I fail to see how the opportunity was "pissed away." We still have oil, and the world still demands oil.

I agree that our two main parties both, in fact, represent the same interests, and that those interests are not OUR interests. So how's this: we should nationalize our oil.
675 2018-06-27 22:30:57 Good! We are hearing that Ethiopia will start extracting crude oil from Ogaden. But make sure that local communities get their fair share from the resource. We don't want the Oromia gold case repeated in Somali region. Are you hearing me Abiy Ahmed?
676 2018-06-27 22:30:54 cracked oil housing. motor runs great, but gotta pull back apart the whole front end of it to get the the bolts to switch them out 
677 2018-06-27 22:30:27 Well, no rush on my account. It may well be 12 to 18 months down the road. True story, the one time I tried getting a Nuru Massage in Germany, they didn't have the true Nuru Gel so she just used a LOT of oil. While I was a bit disappointed by the lack of Nuru, the rest... 
678 2018-06-27 22:30:27 the boys claimed the father beat them with electrical cords dipped with oil  sick! adios joe enjoy hell
679 2018-06-27 22:30:19 last night I broke my cartridge, it completely shattered but my dad saved the oil & now I’m one high happy camper
680 2018-06-27 22:30:10 Lavender essential oil bath bombs available now!
Hemp oil infused to satiate your skin with essential fatty acids omega 3 & 6, it is also rich in vitamins A, E, & D.
Lavender eo is used as a salve for relaxation, and to relieve headaches.
681 2018-06-27 22:29:58 Venezuela is pretty terrible and I don't get people who support Venezuela, it has a smaller welfare state than many west-European countries; its oil market collapsed (it was reliant on that for export) leading to declining reserves for funding the little welfare programs it has.
682 2018-06-27 22:29:52 Would love to rub some oil on you
683 2018-06-27 22:29:30 Do NOT take @sophiedobbsx tanning tips and use baby oil because I am genuinely in agony and burnt to a crisp!!
684 2018-06-27 22:29:27 Bryan washed, vacuumed, and changed the oil in my car. 
685 2018-06-27 22:29:16 Well, The game could be in that disgregating country so se can save It or simply destroy the society to create our own country, always with that ham and olive oil yo confort us. Hahaha
686 2018-06-27 22:29:10 EPIC grape juice olive oil victorias secret perfume i fucking god so straight what the head just so smelly and sexie this
687 2018-06-27 22:29:07 $USDCAD sell the event. sell the news. With #oil over $72 .30 now, this should go below 1.30. #CAD Central bank is artificially depreciating #CAD . Scam!!!! @realDonaldTrump
688 2018-06-27 22:28:59 You sure she's not just checking to see that her shoes are tied?? Oh right, she probably wears velcro shoes 
689 2018-06-27 22:28:45 It's deeper than that.
Murdoch's main income is war-for-profit.
Genie Oil and Gas etc
690 2018-06-27 22:28:34 Boom in oil and nat gas prices manifesting in earnest around 2005. Loose money piling up in YYC + expectations of more to come + interprovincial migration = frothy housing mkt.
691 2018-06-27 22:28:33 Its basically the real world equivalent of Under Seige 2 when Steven Segal saved the Alaskan environment by blowing up an oil refinery?
692 2018-06-27 22:28:28 hate kaayo ko's oil

696 2018-06-27 22:28:07 He was also hurt by being associated with a laughably incompetent state legislature and their inability to govern.  Bright guy,, but too far Right for me.  I’m also skeptical of any official heavily tied to Big Oil. Figure MY interests are way down the list of his priorities
697 2018-06-27 22:28:02 That’s wild! Did you see another one where a lady tried to restore an oil painting and the visage looked like the Troll face meme?
698 2018-06-27 22:27:56 #1 people you're calling "illegal" don't get benefits & contribute more to the economy than detract; see new federal report on this. #2 their countries are ransacked by *our* corporations for natural resources-our wealth comes from them, not the other way around-gold, oil, etc.
699 2018-06-27 22:27:52 @VassyKapelos Watched the terror and worry from the auto industry. All levels of government pledge to save the Aluminum and Steel industries. The Oil industry two years ago? Not so much! Actually, next to zero. Zilch. Sweet eff all. Squat. Nada. Didley.
700 2018-06-27 22:27:50 My car is running soley off love right now. I am low on brake pads, oil, gas even windshield wiper fluid. 
701 2018-06-27 22:27:36 The one time reading the comments was a good idea. Off to clean the oil spill in my kitchen now 
702 2018-06-27 22:27:26 Weapons grade lunacy from the Labour Party snake oil department, problem is there are a lot of thick people out there that will believe it. These individuals are the very climax of everything business does not need now or ever, the unemployment they will bestow would be grievous
703 2018-06-27 22:27:08 Crude Oil will help or hinder all B2C!!

Ultimately the industry structure and the relative strength / weakness of various forces shall determine the capacity to pass on the input price rise or retain the benefits of softer RM when the cycle turns. 

VIP owns 50% market share ;)
704 2018-06-27 22:27:07 This happened to me too imma just learn how to change my own oil

721 2018-06-27 22:25:01 yep , happy to let the press run with the blamehound narratives.

Now think whinging Scots , barnett , and North sea oil theft.
722 2018-06-27 22:24:58 China is a big data oil field....
723 2018-06-27 22:24:55 fyi you dont need to use 2 cycle oil..mineral oil will work just fine and most 30 weight synthetics are mineral oil anyway..so consensus is use what ever oil you want just get your mix right ..if it smokes to much cut back #homesteadHacks
724 2018-06-27 22:24:17 I was doing research today that high levels of thc like oil can make people anxious.. and we smoke it all day long. So try to add cbd in as much as you can. You can even get cbd dab and just after taking. Normal dab take a cbd dab and it will block all the anxiety...
725 2018-06-27 22:24:09 I always get finessed when i get a oil change. Bitches.
726 2018-06-27 22:24:06 Remember the whole oil/gas crises from, hmmm, 18-24 months ago? ...and the calls from the pro-fracking crowd for "energy independence"?  Turns out they mostly wanted to export it. No shock on this end. They get the profits, we get the earthquakes and tainted water tables.
727 2018-06-27 22:24:04 I needed this tweet so badly today. You earned yourself a follower with these wise words.

Now ’scuse me while I oil my pitchfork...
728 2018-06-27 22:23:56 From the same government that bought an oil pipeline no less
729 2018-06-27 22:23:51 I’ve managed to break a picture frame by knocking it off the wall and shatter a full bottle of peppermint oil all over my bedroom floor today. I’m a safety hazard.

-baby oil, shea butter, and hair conditioner can replace shaving cream
733 2018-06-27 22:23:31 This is funny.  Too bad it is so true.  The Dems better burn the midnight oil until they figure out a strategy to deal with this.
734 2018-06-27 22:23:14 Afi Wawu 
What do I know about oil lol
735 2018-06-27 22:22:56 Abeg I’m looking for my engine oil o
I just bought it o
736 2018-06-27 22:22:53 Brent Oil Spot looks to have turned up off the bottom of the established Uptrend Channel and likely to go higher and probably get over that $81 is recent high.
737 2018-06-27 22:22:43 Any chance PBOC can lose control of the devaluation and cause serious inflation in China? Oil price rising, perhaps a drought calling for more food imports?
738 2018-06-27 22:22:41 And fake Green #JillStein who invested in big pharma/tobacco/oil & made her millions off grifting insurance companies. And the tools who followed her stupid self.
739 2018-06-27 22:22:37 Right supply and demand causing high price of crude oil.
740 2018-06-27 22:22:36 Bring it home and store it upside down and the oil will move to the bottom!
741 2018-06-27 22:21:41 You do know that fracking has been the extraction method in the North Sea since the 1970s, don't you?

So if you're against fracking, will you similarly be saying farewell to North Sea oil revenues?
742 2018-06-27 22:21:36 More zen bullshit from a snake oil salesmen.
743 2018-06-27 22:21:31 *holds you close* I dropped the peach oil vial in the water.
744 2018-06-27 22:21:31 Lol yes will I remember that when happened I actually heard a rumor that it was not exercise equipment but his drunk brother came and punched him in the face
745 2018-06-27 22:21:27 من زيته اقله
Fry it (i.e. the fish) with its own oil
746 2018-06-27 22:21:19 Won't be long before converts will be asking why wall advocates didn't try harder to convince them to build it yrs ago.
747 2018-06-27 22:21:09 Have you noticed anything different in the way cab changing gear, jolting in mot gear or anything like that?? Owned or rented?? Check levels and gear box oil, look under cab for signs of leaking
748 2018-06-27 22:21:06 She’s Just another snake oil salesman for the left that likes to talk over people she’s got a big mouth and the only thing that comes out of it is noise that most people just ignore.
749 2018-06-27 22:21:02 I’ve spent like the last two hours reading about not using shampoo anymore and I swear everyone who does it uses coconut oil as a conditioner so it’s definitely worth a try!!
750 2018-06-27 22:20:58 Worked in the Oil Industry in Egypt. Got to  see Pyramids, Luxor Aswan, Dolphins, Sharks and Earthquakes.
751 2018-06-27 22:20:57 Stein just accused Hillary of approving the Uranium One deal....and complained about #SCOTUS. She invested in big pharma/tobacco/oil and pretended to be Green. If she had pulled out, we would have had Florida. She is still defending herself
752 2018-06-27 22:20:52 *Me reading about the Keto diet*

-Foods to eat
Fish (mostly salmon), eggs, spinach, broccoli, avocado, coconut oil ... 
Me: okay that doesn’t sound too bad I eat that anyways. 
*continues to read* 
-Foods to Avoid 
Bananas, oranges ... 
Oh naw I can’t do that big dawg

754 2018-06-27 22:20:28 G2 Russia with it oil reserves and the US desperate to become great again!
755 2018-06-27 22:20:20 Why? U don’t wanna change oil anymore?
756 2018-06-27 22:20:16 So I'm biracial and I've been using this stuff I found at the dollar store. ( yes I know it sounds ridiculous) but its called Lust I Olive Oil and it has worked wonders for my hair. My hair is super soft and easy to maintain. (I have really kinky kinky curls in my hair) I love it
757 2018-06-27 22:20:11 Yes as far as I know McConnell feels exactly the same way as Harry Reid did
758 2018-06-27 22:20:11 I agree with the health benefits, I know certain parts like the CBD oil help people with seizures and such. But the whole getting High part I would think you would just as impaired as being drunk, am I wrong?
759 2018-06-27 22:20:04 Repug swamp rats will burn the midnight oil!Choosing new Supreme Court Nominees!They dont practice what they did preach on waiting until after election!
760 2018-06-27 22:20:03 You fool.  Venezuela was a once beautiful country full of oil and resources.  Socialism has completely crippled it.
761 2018-06-27 22:19:57 However, that’s the risk of being employed as a roughneck. Oil $ can be cyclical, it’s naive to have expected the gravy train to last forever.
762 2018-06-27 22:19:52 setting aside my usual rant about overly tight fiscal policy by China's central government, agree with George that US is making life hard on all those managing their currencies v the USD right now (apart from the oil exporters who are getting a nice little windfall)

765 2018-06-27 22:19:25 Had a nasty customer on the phone a few hours ago and I'm still fuming. Bitch has the nerve to call me back, just to yell at me again. I'm sorry, you're pissed that you only have one free oil change left? How dare I give you the information that the company gives me.
766 2018-06-27 22:19:17 I HAVE CANCER When I mention #MMJ uing medical marijuana everybody FREAKS OUT! RELPIES ALL TELL ME ALL I NEED IS CBD OIL B/C GOD FORBID I GET A BUZZ! IF I WERE POSTING ABOUT DRINKING OR TAKING OPIOIDS THEYD BE FINE WITH IT! HERES THE DEAL IDIOTS IT IMPOSSIBLE TO DIE FROM CANNABIS
767 2018-06-27 22:19:04 Yeah.
Too bad your president no longer wants to protect oceans or marine habitats.

But not to worry - there's money to be made in oil! Instead of fish, we can all eat money!

Too bad about the beaches and the tourism $$...
768 2018-06-27 22:19:03 石油だってオリーブオイルだって変わらぬオイルだ。だからみんな、資源は大切に使おう。
769 2018-06-27 22:19:02 the real question: would it be rust, oil, or dried out lubricant
770 2018-06-27 22:18:53 My uncle just referred to vaping as “an essential oil diffuser” and I haven’t heard anything more accurate.
771 2018-06-27 22:18:47 omg wait i can use soap and oil for my brushes too wow i feel like a real diy person
772 2018-06-27 22:18:12 *laughing in unemployment rates, Wall Street statistics,a thriving oil & gas industry * tell me another one!
773 2018-06-27 22:18:06 a bottle of noisy broccoli detergents
an evaporated bean oil
774 2018-06-27 22:17:57 Were ya'll ever able to get the CBD oil? They are accepting crypto again
775 2018-06-27 22:17:51 *the US gets even more aroused at the mention of oil hamburgers*
776 2018-06-27 22:17:45 I used to love getting the oil slicks
777 2018-06-27 22:17:39 Mods mates, help

If I can’t get the ‘Clarks Leather Lotion’ for my Desert Boots (Leather-Beeswax), you think is recommended use the ‘Mink Oil’ for clean and shine?
778 2018-06-27 22:17:35 I can’t stand Trump, but if people aren’t going to do something after W  started an unnecessary war, all for oil money, that resulted in so many dead soldiers, then a lot of them never will. Sadly.
779 2018-06-27 22:17:29 so we all agree that product > oil of every pearl's un-insides aye?
780 2018-06-27 22:17:20 kundi ang administrasyon papatay sa akin eh ito namang barangay jusko may oil spill yata rito
781 2018-06-27 22:17:19 sorry but you know nothing about Venezuela, yes we depend on oil. Because any of the socialist government that we have had , have develop another alternative to stop our dependency on oil. They increased government and public spend to perpetuate their power.
782 2018-06-27 22:17:05 I love boobs. I love to look at em I like to touch em. They are just awesome thanks Ladies....
783 2018-06-27 22:16:45 Na so d innocent Uche boy for be like rapist because of one good for nothing skrepintus.....Nna oil Dey ur head ur God no Dey sleep
784 2018-06-27 22:16:39 Qld? 
I call it Redneck Wonderland (which I stole from a Midnight Oil song).
785 2018-06-27 22:16:29 I have long curls, and De Lorenzo 'Rejuven8' shamp & conditioner is awesome. Smells amazing too. 
And Garnier 'miraculous oil' is the best for frizz. Better than coconut oil and not greasy. Also cheap at supermarket!
786 2018-06-27 22:16:29 Yep cuticle oil is key! Especially at night before bed 
787 2018-06-27 22:16:12 Yes ! They call him “Pipeline Kevin” bringing Canada Oil tar sands to a refinery near you....to than export!
788 2018-06-27 22:16:09 Best show ever soon as it finished we were out in the garden making jumps with dads oil cans and a bit of wood and turning the mud guard up to make a motor bike noise on our Raleigh boxers  good days
789 2018-06-27 22:16:08 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
790 2018-06-27 22:16:04 I like almond oil. My skin drinks it up! #LancomeForAll
791 2018-06-27 22:16:02 What else they got?
792 2018-06-27 22:15:57 Have you considered using coconut oil instead of conditioner? Long lasting/only need a small amount/cruelty free/way better for the environment etc etc!
793 2018-06-27 22:15:53 Thank you, I use Frankincense on my oil burner.
794 2018-06-27 22:15:51 Sorry to hear about the wait! Next time you need an oil change, let us know. We can help you find the best deals in your area.
795 2018-06-27 22:15:47 Oil look
796 2018-06-27 22:15:47 Can you also please stand up for our 10s of thousands of workers who produce steel, aluminum, pipelines,and oil? They could use your support as well. Thanks.
797 2018-06-27 22:15:40 White Buffalo Oil. The CEO and owner are friends of #TheResistance.
798 2018-06-27 22:15:39 Castor oil? What does it do? Where can I get it
799 2018-06-27 22:15:37 $oil up $usd up 
Explain that one
800 2018-06-27 22:15:36 and your secret touch of “rice bran 
oil” had the flavors mingling deliciously [not too overpowering either]! #cleaneating  vibrant #event
801 2018-06-27 22:15:34 Thank you @jamie_genevieve for telling us about mixing your oil with your moisturer... It's a game changer
802 2018-06-27 22:15:34 You should be wise in your comment Niger Delta oil discovery, was financed by Shell go and read some text books before you comment. Niger Delta states exported palm oil in the year 1855 get your fact right dude.
803 2018-06-27 22:15:34 Or because oil is hovering $50 instead of $30, but don’t let the facts cloud your hate
804 2018-06-27 22:15:32 Quiet a long time
805 2018-06-27 22:15:31 Warning: Be cautious when using grapefruit essential oil in your bath...my entire body is on mf fiiire.
806 2018-06-27 22:15:11 More shirtless selfies, Please
807 2018-06-27 22:15:06 of course they are
808 2018-06-27 22:14:58 Do not believe Pence.  He doesn’t care about the rights of people of Venezuela.  He and his ilk care about the fact that Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world.
809 2018-06-27 22:14:45 It’s good to remember that these people are NOT fleeing a war devastated country. They are fleeing from poverty caused by a  bunch of crooks that raided an oil producer country.
810 2018-06-27 22:14:38 I'm no fan of the CPC. I'll be voting for them in 2019 because the rest of the field is farther left than Mao Zedong, but otherwise I'd prefer a MCGA candidate.

Oil built Saudi Arabia, and gave Norway a trillion dollar sovereignty fund. Oil can easily build a stable economy.
811 2018-06-27 22:14:34 Innocently bring my baby in for an oil change and Honda tries to scheme me like kk yes i’m teeny and female but nuh uh honey daddy taught me better than that, nice try tho !!!
812 2018-06-27 22:14:33 @kapaya1234 can you answer me why Braves fans love to hate on Snitker every time we lose? but overlook the fact that he has put us in the best situation for a NL East title in 5 years! I personally think he is a great manager and the perfect manger for us but your thoughts?
813 2018-06-27 22:14:27 yas neutrogena suck all the damn oil from my damn face so it peels and cracks and dies
814 2018-06-27 22:14:23 What does the U.S. need most from Canada and they can't live without - OIL. To bad we didn't build those pipelines to the east and west so we could sell more to the rest of the world to offset loses from Trumps tariffs.
815 2018-06-27 22:14:22 So do you really believe that oil prices are the reason why we are screwed and not the Communist policies implemented by a socialist country?
816 2018-06-27 22:14:21 Only half? I would have guessed more. 

I still believe they owe everyone detailed accounts and explain why they don’t (appear) to ring fence donations. 

A dollar to save Orangutans might easily go to protest glyphosate. 

And even the damn palm oil issue is way more complex too
817 2018-06-27 22:14:06 It's like oil and water - it aint going to work!
818 2018-06-27 22:14:05 I need to get better so I can hear, film and stop smelling of plans oil
819 2018-06-27 22:13:59 Mj growers really should just spray their plants with neem oil and food grade diatomaceous earth.  Using ozone in greenhouses would kill a lot of pests and benefit the plants.  Neem needs to be ingested by pests and it kills most things.  It also helps against fungal diseases.
820 2018-06-27 22:13:37 Y’all hoes used to love  light skin niggas why y’all all of a sudden want us dark niggas.... I thought I was black as an oil spill.. or too black to see
821 2018-06-27 22:13:36 It’s funny how their memories are so short
822 2018-06-27 22:13:34 You’re lucky you had a retention bonus and gear subsidy to begin with. Most commercial trades have never had those benefits.  (Maybe boots...maybe). But those are hand outs you shouldn’t be relying on. Bonus’s are tied to company profitability. Company’s make less $ when oil down
823 2018-06-27 22:13:29 yeah, free market fiat. I simply ask what's a dollar worth to an Arab selling 41 gal of oil? In 1970 it was $2-4/bbl and 35 dollars was "worth" one oz. of gold. Don't see how debasing currencies is part of a free market. Pay me with counterfeit, I might as well take manure.
824 2018-06-27 22:13:14 I love the smell of tea tree oil. I’d snort that shit if I could.
825 2018-06-27 22:13:01 *Oil is mentioned*

*US gets aroused*
826 2018-06-27 22:12:48 Russia downgrades its 2019 GDP growth estimates from +2.2% down to +1.4%.
Even with oil price doubling in the past year, the level of theft of Russia's economy by Putin & Co is astonishing.
827 2018-06-27 22:12:25 False choice. Could cover contaminated soil is tailings ponds. Could cover reservoirs to reduce evaporation. You can pick up and move the panels. I'd be willing to have a well beside panels.. would you want your house well beside an oil leak? Sorry but this is a bad take.
828 2018-06-27 22:12:12 Sir iss me aapko hazaro aise authentic links milenge jo bataenge ki crude oil kitna sasta hai, tax hum kitna or q de rahe hai.
International crude oil is cheap in this gov constituency...
Sambhale nahi ja Rahi hai inse chize ye bat hai yaha pr
829 2018-06-27 22:12:04 Or the higher oil prices could simply reflect limited supply capacity after years of under investments
830 2018-06-27 22:11:58 sad
the country with the largest oil reserves in the world
have to leave your country
831 2018-06-27 22:11:46 yes it was a capful of olive oil and 1 tbsp of dish soap
832 2018-06-27 22:11:41 This is MY summer. I’m gonna workout, eat healthy, oil my hair, drink water to fix my skin, do an internship, start working on my capstone project, travel, read books, watch movies, AND LEARN SOMETHING NEW EVERY DAY! Can’t wait!!!
833 2018-06-27 22:11:12 I hate when people eat their nasty ass McDonald's in class bc they sound gross and all the oil from the food gives off an unpleasant aroma
834 2018-06-27 22:10:43 I arrived at Pep Boys for a Lyft oil change at 10:30am. They literally just pulled that fucker into the garage. It’s 5:10 right now. #FML 
835 2018-06-27 22:10:39 And that fake green oil/tobacco/pharma investing Jill Stein and her weirdo followers.
836 2018-06-27 22:10:35 Investment and growth also tells what the price of oil is.  We were expanding a few years ago, all new projects put on hold or cancelled before NDP came into power and oil $ bottomed. Talk has been that they will continue once $ increases.
837 2018-06-27 22:10:29 take a stroll of the oil pipeline while you there @realDonaldTrump , there is a spot where you can drink your water #NoDAPL #ImpeachTrump take  @kevincramer with you
838 2018-06-27 22:10:22 CBD oil and the carm app!

840 2018-06-27 22:10:20 His is a fraud that sells snake oil and taint wipes but his followers may be rapid idiots that have held guns.

844 2018-06-27 22:09:52 Thats brilliant! Think of the uses; neighbourhood watch patrols, could be adapted for rough terrain & used in large scale farms, oil pipeline inspections, mine field & unexploded ordnance, automated guides for tourists, search & rescue, assistance for infirm. I want! 
845 2018-06-27 22:09:51 Olive &amp; almond oil are rich in essential fatty acids which help strengthen dry &amp; cracked nails

849 2018-06-27 22:09:35 You just miserable, an idle mind is a devils workshop indeed, you doesn’t seem to have anything good going in your life. Are you sure you have any oil well in your backyard? LIER!! Never underestimate a Fulani girl, she’s high up there already, you should be worried abt yourself
850 2018-06-27 22:09:22 Add a layer of oil next time to prevent oxidisation, perhaps.
851 2018-06-27 22:09:16 I don’t know man, even if you don’t use any body wash just a rinse with some hot water is really useful at the end of the day just to steam & unclog some dirt & oil from your skins pores

853 2018-06-27 22:09:12 Obviously a natural blonde. I haven’t even watched one rally on TV because of other more important events like watering the lawn, changing oil in the car, or walking the dog. Enjoy the racist event, Trump is sure to say the same crap he’s been lying about for a year and a half.

Oil Be Back
858 2018-06-27 22:08:31 Oil changed complete
859 2018-06-27 22:08:31 @BoyGeorge  I just had kayle and mushroom sautéed in coconut oil with some sliced banana . Super combination 
860 2018-06-27 22:08:09 Oil painting
861 2018-06-27 22:08:06 its so hot my coconut oil has melted
862 2018-06-27 22:08:04 When BJP was in opposition they used to do the same, they only defamed our country in front of everyone, and hid the facts of economy growth, economical stability,petrol price control in spite of high prices of crude oil, high education expenditure, infrastructure development etc
863 2018-06-27 22:07:46 I think it is still just in Sympathy Risk with the Argentine Debt Crisis, $EWZ has a lot of stake in that County. Not sure $PBR exact exposure to Argentine problems. 

Oil price goes up and no one can pay for it scenario.
864 2018-06-27 22:07:42 Does US still import oil. I thought they were on their way to be 1st or 2nd biggest exporter in the world? given they send 20% of it to China alone.
865 2018-06-27 22:07:30 After switching its primary cooking oil from lard to vegetable oil 3 decades ago, Okinawa is now #1 obese prefecture among 47 prefectures in Japan.
866 2018-06-27 22:07:17 I actually don't think Norway needs them, why? We have our  and oil, does not make sense. Norway is rich on its own, so why?
867 2018-06-27 22:07:03 Also, try using water wipes or make your own wipes! We do this at my work, we use paper towels, water baby oil, and baby shampoo 
868 2018-06-27 22:07:01 Trump  presides  Iran  to  rely  on  crude  oil.
869 2018-06-27 22:06:57 Had to install my door handles on my old car, ac refills and do my own oil changes. Learned from YouTube, yaaaas. It's most satisfactory
870 2018-06-27 22:06:26 Are you kidding? 
I wouldn't make it at all without ac! 
This is my summer routine: pour peppermint oil all over myself, sit in front of the fan with the ac cranked! 
871 2018-06-27 22:06:11 Oil change & car detailed this weekend. IT'S ABOUT TIME. 
872 2018-06-27 22:06:08 Gee!! Venezuela economy must be booming about now since their protectionism, cartelizing their national oil business, removed market competition and made life grand for their citizens.

Oops!!  Didn't work.

Bet President Trump is clueless on protectionism. Or you are clueless.
873 2018-06-27 22:05:57 The oil will deactivate the sunscreen
874 2018-06-27 22:05:42 Ini semua gara-gara SIRIM kata diorang pun boleh buat produk kosmetik, tu yang zauji bagi cadangan mengarut tu. Udah2 le tu, fokus je pada Huffaz Oil tu cukup la. Tak perlu tamak semua nak conquer .
875 2018-06-27 22:05:33 Since Can oil is so huge, could have led to extractors shutting up shop? 

Thinking aloud here, but you’re prob right re QE blowback
876 2018-06-27 22:05:30 Russia new role on managing global oil prices gives Putin a strong hand to manoeuvre diplomatically with Western countries consuming much oil @JeremyCorbyn4PM @jeremycorbyn @johnmcdonnellMP @EmilyThornberry @LabourDfID
877 2018-06-27 22:05:18 Yeah he is evolving some, I’ll give him credit for that   I think after he started using CBD oil and saw the real benefits he researched how cannabis can really help with so much. Now we just need him to do research on other important issues 
878 2018-06-27 22:05:15 To transform the palm oil market and make #sustainability the norm, collaborative efforts will be required from growers, governments, the private sector and consumers.
879 2018-06-27 22:05:06 #WedQuizDay 15 Kurt Russell was in which 2016 film about a Oil Rig disaster?
880 2018-06-27 22:05:03 Kennedy is 81
881 2018-06-27 22:04:46 Not at all! We just need to keep working to improve the sustainability of the industry and make responsible, deforestation-free palm oil the norm.
882 2018-06-27 22:04:31 What happened to oil around then as well. I’m certain that oil is just following Hotelling’s Rule and ZIRP + QE would mean that oil follows a lower extraction cost path (can had recession then too if I recall?)
883 2018-06-27 22:04:29 Shaving your les with coconut oil is great till u step in the shower and bout bust your ass
884 2018-06-27 22:04:26 "For those of you that read my blog, you know I support CBD and its healing properties. So if I were to incorporate CBD oil into my supplements business, how many of you would be interested?"
885 2018-06-27 22:04:21 Luv IB, but problem is IB has $19MM budget.  Big oil has +/-$19Trillion.  Only the lawyers will win in this.  Need to get Fed to help IB.  After all the govt is complicit in the regulations or lack of.
886 2018-06-27 22:04:20 Did anyone check for a pulse?
887 2018-06-27 22:04:19 Oil reaches new highs since 2014. Hope y’all are ready to see $80/bbl this summer.
888 2018-06-27 22:04:12 oh my god was this done by a PROFESSIONAL??? there must be someone you can contact that can help get that person to stop piercing (or at least in that shop)....that’s HORRIBLE...when it heals try bio oil for the scars (try target or walmart)
889 2018-06-27 22:04:05 Any SCOTUS Justice over 75 should be tested for dementia on a yearly basis.
890 2018-06-27 22:04:05 My essential oil diffuser: "we recommend 3 drops of oil to get the desired effect"

Me: *shakes in 7 drops*
891 2018-06-27 22:04:01 I think that if the Trump Administration follows through on threats to globally ban Iranian oil, it’s going higher....
892 2018-06-27 22:03:55 I don’t care about any of that
893 2018-06-27 22:03:50 It's been 7 years fa
894 2018-06-27 22:03:36 NEWS: Opposition MPs once again livid in the House of Representatives this afternoon after being told that Energy Minister, Dr. Andrew Wheatley, would not be answering over due questions on the State-owned oil refinery, Petrojam.
895 2018-06-27 22:03:33 Man this sucks I woke up and one of my ears is blocked, sounds like everything is in another room. Already tried Hydrogen Peroxide and Vegtable Oil and the works.
896 2018-06-27 22:03:28 Accidentally got Olbas oil on my balls ack and omgggg it burns like a mother fucker
897 2018-06-27 22:03:23 Yes, blaming third party voters also conveniently ignores that lots of folks were and are angry about jobs and livelihoods.  The recent story about fishermen in the swamps in Louisiana having their very lifeblood destroyed by oil and natural gas pipelines is another example.
898 2018-06-27 22:03:15 MELT UP IN OIL?? The #Cushing number really shouldn’t have surprised anybody today. Although not always the case #API made sense. MELT UP? The answer is no and it already happened #OPEC is back in control of #oil. They will increase as needed. Just classic #latecycle stuff #OOTT
899 2018-06-27 22:03:01 Medical but the wording is loose, expect full recreational to follow. Haven't tried the oil, it's pricey.
900 2018-06-27 22:02:56 How did regulations harm us? Our nat'l debt is the highest it's been since WWII. Regs keep our air, water safe to breathe, drink. Regs give us freedom to speak, read, use Internet. Letting Big Oil and Gas and Big Telecom control and abuse us is bad, healthwise and freedom-wise.
901 2018-06-27 22:02:50 @POTUS The countries of the OPEC cartel agreed on Friday to pump 1 million barrels more crude oil per day, but wall street investors trying to keep prices high to make huge profits!
902 2018-06-27 22:02:37 Get the straight jackets and padded rooms ready.
903 2018-06-27 22:02:34 Oil
904 2018-06-27 22:02:32 I used to think I only liked them in the Green Giant packages frozen with the weird butter sauce but I started cutting them in 1/4s and frying them with just like coconut oil and pepper and curry powder and onion powder and HOW THE FUCK THIS VEGETAL SO GOOD
905 2018-06-27 22:02:22 Jorge dead ass just gave me the fastest oil change and tire rotation in all of my years of driving
906 2018-06-27 22:02:18 I had a civi that lasted for years as long as you do regular oil change and maintains
907 2018-06-27 22:02:15 GIRL, a little bit of olive oil and salt, saute for a minute and perfection 
908 2018-06-27 22:02:02 I've seen no evidence at all in my stock holdings, of any significant activity in the oil patch!  The prices are still at historic lows in the smaller cap companies!
909 2018-06-27 22:02:02 We do that at times too
910 2018-06-27 22:02:01 The Telegraph India US piles Iran heat on India The Telegraph India New Delhi: The US has said it will tell India and others to cut oil imports from Iran to "zero" by November 4 or face sanctions and postponed overnight a key meeting where the issue would have topped the…
911 2018-06-27 22:01:59 Rojo looking for the oil check submission tho.
912 2018-06-27 22:01:58 I'm getting an oil change and I forgot about my shibari lanyard until the lady who moved my car into the shop walked in, lanyard swaying
913 2018-06-27 22:01:49 Toast is amazing. Why did I stop eating toast? Oh, yeah, bread is poison since it has soybean in it. Finally found the Sara Lee kind that doesn't use soybean oil locally. Thanks, @covarla! I'm full of toast!
914 2018-06-27 22:01:48 A shot gun and some peanut oil, just let me know when we getting started.
915 2018-06-27 22:01:47 Kinda of creepy like Olive Oil legs
916 2018-06-27 22:01:37 No this is just pure hate but they’re okay with walking into middle eastern countries who don’t want them there, murdering thousands, taking their oil AND then have the nerve to call them terrorists. When ultimately the US is the terrorist in this equation.
917 2018-06-27 22:01:30 My client has done so well, being a nail and skin biter, after three treatments, look what she’s achieved. All done and helped with her companion “nourish oil” used twice daily. She has turned them around! Before (top) After (below)
918 2018-06-27 22:01:11 No. Big Oil greed!
919 2018-06-27 22:01:10 they'll profit from it. Keep an eye on them, you'll see. cheney and bush did it with Afghani oil pipelines. All hidden is plain sight. They even had pictures of it.. folks just didn't want to know.. so.. oh well.
920 2018-06-27 22:01:09 Exactly. Also, cut the oil. Your body won't store carbs except under weird circumstances that you probably won't be dealing with. But we store fat hella well. Don't eat it and your body won't store those excess calories. I eat more now "dieting" than I ever did eating omni.
921 2018-06-27 22:01:09 P20... turns everything you touch orange & feels like a coating of oil instead.
922 2018-06-27 22:01:08 Absolute nut jobs  give this lot some cannabis oil calm them down.
923 2018-06-27 22:01:07 Pec envy!
924 2018-06-27 22:01:03 Hahahaha
925 2018-06-27 22:01:02 Actually, the correct pluralization is crudes oil.
926 2018-06-27 22:00:57 Says the guy that can’t even raise oil prices. Dum dum Plotkins
927 2018-06-27 22:00:54 Murdoch owns Fox news and Genie Energy. Genie found Oil in Golan Heights in Syria. Trump moved that embassy to Jerusalem because of Oil. 
This is why Fox will do anything for Trump, all for Oil.
928 2018-06-27 22:00:54 As if to thrash any notion of well supplied oil market, it’s no longer just Iran and Venezuela whose supply is at risk but now it’s Libya too —-as well as Canada and the Permian transport constraint

934 2018-06-27 22:00:16 Diddo
935 2018-06-27 22:00:14 Try this next time: score the skin about halfway down, open the gaps and fill with salt & pepper, and then sprinkle sage all over the skin and pan-fry it skin-side down in a little oil. You’ll thank me later.

940 2018-06-27 21:59:54 @Walmart what’s the longest acceptable wait time for an oil change and tire rotation? I don’t think over three hours is okay...
941 2018-06-27 21:59:54 Was able to get my oil changed just in time before they closed 
942 2018-06-27 21:59:45 Hahahaha true dat
943 2018-06-27 21:59:39 You mean like a ‘stable’ economy based almost entirely on oil prices being astronomically high forever, like your beloved conservatives done?
944 2018-06-27 21:59:27 Wonder who’s messing with that! All that oil, so little light.
945 2018-06-27 21:59:22 So all the nails will be cheap poor quality Russian steel. Just like those Keystone XL oil pipes that keep leaking.
946 2018-06-27 21:59:18 Who  do you want to hang out with, Brady or Hindley? Right now, I'd take an unsmiling tovarich who I know isn't really my mate over a smiling false freund or ami who is really a total snake. And Russia has gas and oil, the EU don't have shit except leaky borders.

955 2018-06-27 21:57:27 I’m not sure something that high in coconut oil would play nice with my skin. I know it’s not trendy but I still swear by No.7 where they do the thing with the face scanner.

970 2018-06-27 21:55:23 Nothing more annoying then when u drown urself in oil & u try to go on ur phone but u can’t because of ur big oily hands
971 2018-06-27 21:55:20 This finish is not good safe and wouldn’t make a good cutting board. For that I’d recommend Danish oil which is food safe after curing. You’ll need to sand it down and refinish occasionally.
972 2018-06-27 21:55:18 So i just opened my coconut oil a bit too aggressively and turns out due to the hot weather it is now liquid  it's everywhere
973 2018-06-27 21:55:05 Won’t happen... Trump will be jailed for treason by then.
974 2018-06-27 21:54:45 America's winning?  Really?  Then why is the stock market tanking all year, oil and gas are soaring, tariffs are driving companies under and ending jobs, deficits are exploding, the vaunted tax cut is flopping, and we're alienating all our old allies.
975 2018-06-27 21:54:39 Yea we did alright cause I am always a caster and stay away from stuff we also made alot of oil between us and the witch
976 2018-06-27 21:54:37 Cancer does not sit well with me.... this is a strong possibility when slathering on chemicals. Lemongrass essential oil works relatively well - and no fear of toxic chemicals.
977 2018-06-27 21:54:31 meh, just a bunch of old rocks.. gotta be some oil around there somewhere for Supreme Leader Orange / President Profit's friends to extract..

981 2018-06-27 21:54:01 Qatar tournisme is gaining so much from this (cheap) deal that contesting it is a joke. But they are the evil Arabs coming with their oil and gas money so we have to fight them...
982 2018-06-27 21:53:55 $CEI Oil prices rose on Wed,supply disruptions in Libya & Canada.U.S.officials said all countries should stop Iranian crude imports by Nov.
983 2018-06-27 21:53:50 OK CDC with all of the negative clinical trials of fish oil - what exactly is it in salmon that is heart healthy? It seems like the omega 3s are not the reason.
984 2018-06-27 21:53:49 Somethin’s gotta break. I was told silver follows oil... lol. It makes sense to me as higher oil prices = higher production costs. However I should have been more conscious of options expirations and the end of Q2. There was still a lot of short positions on Friday’s COT.
985 2018-06-27 21:53:26 I give up. You’ll have to watch and learn.
986 2018-06-27 21:53:24 Definitely shower mask cleanser oil

989 2018-06-27 21:52:56 Yet there’s no country on Earth you can cite where it’s been successful and sustained. Some used to cite Venezuela, but oil, on which their economy is dependent, w/cheap prices, and VZ is now broke and riddled w/corruption

1003 2018-06-27 21:50:47 Am I wrong in thinking that 1970’s saw the following: 3 day weeks; inflation peaking at 20%; 3-4% fall in GDP, 1m unemployed; bail out from IMF. Clearly many variables (oil price & unionsetc) but be v careful abt looking to 79’s as halcyon days.

1027 2018-06-27 21:45:10 Glass jar of coconut oil  works for some people.  For non-Vegans goats butter is also an option (so we are told!)

1033 2018-06-27 21:44:14 We need oil.
1034 2018-06-27 21:43:58 The consensus was that that's a dead wolf on @SecretaryZinke's Christmas card (along with an assault rifle, oil drill rig, axe, etc....) You know, just normal Christmas stuff that clearly says "Happy B-day Baby Jesus!" #MTPol #MTNews
1035 2018-06-27 21:43:30 Have you ever tried peppermint essential oil for headaches? It works really well (and fast), just don’t get it in your eyes! 
1036 2018-06-27 21:43:21 Another thing is an exfoliating routine for the lips, personaly I apply peppermint oil then vaseline before I sleep and when I wake up I exfolitae my lips with a towel after washing the vaseline then moisturize them with lip butter 'palmers is incredible'
1037 2018-06-27 21:43:17 Ethiopian soldiers massacared tens of thousands of people in the Somali region of Ogaden to clear land for oil and gas exploration.  We cannot rest untill the perpetrators of these heinous crimes are brought to justice.

1039 2018-06-27 21:43:06 It's great man. I had never smoked or anything like that until I heard that vaping cbd oil can help with anxiety and stress and it's been a life saver for me. Without a doubt worth looking into. No regrets.
1040 2018-06-27 21:43:00 At the mechanic getting the oil and transmission oil changed
1041 2018-06-27 21:42:39 Long story short maybe i’m supposed to be cooking with more coconut oil than olive oil.. the cleaning process was hella annoying i mean it was a brand new bottle  now I gotta get home at 3am to reclean everything cause of my obsessive cleanliness.. it’ll be worth waking up to
1042 2018-06-27 21:42:27 Apparently she’s 25???? I’d be asking for my money back from Oil of Olay.

1045 2018-06-27 21:42:21 Seasoned the lamb chops this morning had em in the fridge all day, came home and made some red wine and butter to cook them in instead of oil 
1046 2018-06-27 21:42:20 i sealed my prayers with coconut oil. not sure if that’s a thing, but it felt right 
1047 2018-06-27 21:42:07 Michael said that Joe Jackson would make them strip
‘oil you down, it would be like a ritual’ before hitting them.
Called MJ ugly, specifically his nose.
No ‘dad’ - I’m Joseph to you
But MJ also said he forgave and loved his father.
For the Jackson family,
R.I.P Joseph Jackson
1048 2018-06-27 21:42:05 I also use a leave in conditioner that has Jamaican black castor oil & ACV. I take nature bounty’s hair skin & nail vitamins & drink a lot of water
1049 2018-06-27 21:42:04 It's important to establish a routine, specificaly when it comes to going out
For me I find that, cleansing, then rose water, then moisturizer, sun block then aloe vera helps my skin stay fresh throughout the day, also peppermint oil for the lips helps them withstand the heat -
1050 2018-06-27 21:41:56 You, a big dummy: oil

Me, an intellectual: USA SAUCE
1051 2018-06-27 21:41:33 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Raleigh sleeps.
1052 2018-06-27 21:41:33 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Dallas sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
1053 2018-06-27 21:41:33 The coconut oil in the bedroom which I slather on moi, is liquid. #Heatwaveuk
1054 2018-06-27 21:41:32 I took some cbd oil, drank some green tea with ginger, am enjoying a nice glass of water with ginseng:) did some yoga, meditated, am trying to stay focused. Today is a day of healing for me. My next move is to eat & go for a drive out in the country:)  #MeDay #Healing
1055 2018-06-27 21:41:23 swear jakes the best. Got out of class with a clean car & oil change paid for

1057 2018-06-27 21:41:07 I wear wigs & braids so i keep my hair in protective styles. When i have them in i apply Jamaican black castor oil to my scalp once or twice a week. When i don’t have them in i condition my hair & add the oil once or twice a week.
1058 2018-06-27 21:41:06 No wonder it’s a write-off with only a bit of frontal damage - xenon lights, aircon condenser, intercooler, oil cooler, distance radar all in the front 6”, plus dashboard ripped apart with airbags. Might as well drive around with a crystal decanter stuck to the front bumper
1059 2018-06-27 21:40:53 Venezuela's foray into socialism failed for a number of reasons: too reliant on oil sales at the expense of other industries, esp. agriculture, few imports, currency tied to US$, currency exchange managed (poorly) by gov't, business not producing anything only playing markets.
1060 2018-06-27 21:40:37 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul? Micah 6:7
1061 2018-06-27 21:40:31 It's okay, I got the Nuln Oil too! 
1062 2018-06-27 21:40:30 Filled a hot water bottle XD. It was mostly coz I got home late and there was no point blasting expensive oil heater in a losing battle against the icy chill for a few hours before sleep 
1063 2018-06-27 21:40:17 Construction isn’t close to the flow of oil. Construction is a capital project, which will always be in flux depending on price of oil and how well the company is doing. I said those closest to the flow.
1064 2018-06-27 21:40:15 Look at oil performance and demand from 200 to 2015 lolol
1065 2018-06-27 21:40:14 Lmao yeah cause the middle reflects everything that progress has left behind. Coal and oil lmao
1066 2018-06-27 21:40:07 First of all, my room smells like tea tree oil 
1067 2018-06-27 21:40:05 ขอโทษ

1070 2018-06-27 21:39:53 @Jay_Hansen SCTA says "that the most anti-teacher member of the school board, Jay Hansen, has recently taken a position at a "not-for-profit" heavily financed by Big Oil corporations." Who dat?
1071 2018-06-27 21:39:47 Wake up , do something about Oil, too high prices. You are going the loser George Bush route. Believe me it’s not good for humanity or you

1074 2018-06-27 21:39:20 I used to work for an American oil company and we’d get a warning and then fired if we didn’t back into spaces. Got into the habit since.
1075 2018-06-27 21:38:43 I was just there switching cars so I could take H's for an oil change. I never went inside. Next time!

1077 2018-06-27 21:38:38 actually oil is renewable energy as plants an d animals die they eventually return to a carbon form
1078 2018-06-27 21:38:34 H.N. Suddenly glitched and her eyes widen in terror as her tongue was hanging and oil spilled out profuselyin her mouth. her screams are high pitched in glitched as she is in pain,
1079 2018-06-27 21:38:34 When there is pears BABY OIL
1080 2018-06-27 21:38:32 Bc the only “culture” (it’s in quotations bc it’s not a culture) that had dreads were the Vikings and even then, it was mismanagement of their hair. Tbqh, the Vikings weren’t known for being clean so when they got dreads, it was due to natural oil buildup, dirt and grime

1082 2018-06-27 21:37:59 @DanaRohrabacher you hit all the trump rally points. Debate @HarleyRouda - voters in CA48 can learn:
He stands for sensible humane immigration reform not open borders, sustainable energy jobs not off shore oil rigs, healthcare & retirement for all Americans not just the wealthy.
1083 2018-06-27 21:37:52 1. #PalmOil far superior on usage. Offers itself to far wider uses than rape/sun/soy oil 
2. OilPalm area 25mHA, soy 120mHA, rape 33mHA, sunflower 26mHA.
3. Palm oil production is max of the group - 62mMT.
(Do the maths for replacing 1MT of Palm oil by any other oil)
1084 2018-06-27 21:37:51 Yall would not believe how 40 min before I gotta leave out for work Im cooking.. apparently slammed the fridge and my brand new glass bottle of olive oil falls and breaks all over my feet thank God I had on sandals thats rinseable.. but olive oul was just everywhereeeee
1085 2018-06-27 21:37:44 For soup, cook diced leek in oil, then simmer with beef, chipotle, chicken broth and lemongrass. Top with olive oil.
1086 2018-06-27 21:37:40 I just watched Backstabbing for beginners. I wonder is that the type of business dealings that our President and his family are doing. Has he perfected the bribes that the UN was acussed of in  the food for oil scandle.
1087 2018-06-27 21:37:26 Well I could look back at 3.5 million unemployed, interest rates at 17% even with all the wealth from oil revenues, which Thatcher promptly sold off with every thing else that she could sell to her capitalist mates, but hey let’s just concentrate on the last 8 years, a shambles.
1088 2018-06-27 21:37:25 They leveraged everything on oil. If your whole country is balanced on one resource it's gonna crash like a jumbo jet when the market for that resource destabilizes.
1089 2018-06-27 21:37:19 Let's be honest, the Exxon Valdez is gushing oil like a mutherf'er but the oil tank in my front yard is also leaking and needs to be remediated.
1090 2018-06-27 21:37:15 busted the head gasket so there’s water in my oil and oil in my water then on my dads car the fan didn’t spin and it overheated and died so I had to push it in a parking spot when I got to work this morning.
1091 2018-06-27 21:36:56 Keep hydrated, drink herbal teas. For  cravings during a long workday I have a small handful of almonds or a square of good bitter chocolate. Espresso with a shot of cream & coconut oil works too. When I do IF my first meal includes eggs, keeps me satisfied for a long time!
1092 2018-06-27 21:36:48 Don’t be surprise if I get accelerated beard growth I use castor oil 
1093 2018-06-27 21:36:41 Snake oil salesman...
1094 2018-06-27 21:36:41 The beard resurrect is coming on nicely... Must just get oil before it finishes & stress less, so that I can stop pulling at it...
1095 2018-06-27 21:36:16 What r u talking? U r nothing without usa. Middle east r never save! Your book is full of lies. U are nothing without your oil. Do u rely think the west world likes u? If you name is MUSLIM, u never be a friend of the كافر. Not تركيا is your enemy. Open your eyes  arab people
1096 2018-06-27 21:36:15 I drove from TP-PV then from PV back to TP all within the same time span with 0 oil  started smoking at first..
1097 2018-06-27 21:36:11 You're right. Scotland's deficit was lower in 2016-17 in real terms than in 2013-14 despite oil revenues dramatically falling to £0.209bn.
1098 2018-06-27 21:36:11 1973. England demolished by the West Indies. The National Front. The first oil shock. The Troubles continue after Bloody Sunday. Recall of all British forces from Asia and the Gulf 5 years before. A banking crisis the following year. The IMF bailout still 4 years in the future.
1099 2018-06-27 21:36:04 Sunscreen, not oil! Oil will fry you like you are in a frying pan!

1101 2018-06-27 21:35:51 Nowadays John we take down democracies in order to install dictators, + the term 'dictator' is used to demonise elected leaders, especially if they have oil or some other resource (or lack of debt like Greece). The new Elizabethan age, the age of piracy.
1102 2018-06-27 21:35:49 In a lame man language, oil is more ingredient while the perfume is the finished product 

A perfume contains 30% and 10% water or so 

Like orange and orange juice... you get?
1103 2018-06-27 21:35:16 Oil here, somebody get the oil.
1104 2018-06-27 21:35:05 How much of our CPP is going into the extractive industries? Give a proportion of investment monies/support showing renewables vs oil&gas
1105 2018-06-27 21:35:00 Was it worth its name when #SaudiArabia , your #oil buddy, was chairing it?

1107 2018-06-27 21:34:23 Tea tree oil really does wonders for pimples.
1108 2018-06-27 21:34:12 Is that oil or what?
1109 2018-06-27 21:34:05 Every time you tweet about one of your snake oil products, you sound less like Billy Mays and more like a divorced dad trying to make child support. "Buy my DVD please!? I know it's way overpriced but I need this money so I can pay child support..."
1110 2018-06-27 21:33:48 Yeah, I thought something serious had happened  and you crying about being burned by hot oil

1112 2018-06-27 21:33:06 Castor oil didn’t do anything 
1113 2018-06-27 21:32:56 These sound beyond amazing! The whole flavour list leaves me breathless... if i may ask: do you put dried lavender or lavender oil in the jam?
1114 2018-06-27 21:32:52 Woke up from a nap and remembered I had to go pick up my car from it’s oil change. Couldn’t find my keys after 10 mins of looking so I just grabbed the spare set. 

Walked outside to get in my car & realized I’m fucking stupid.
1115 2018-06-27 21:32:48 It's been 1,000 days since the BP oil spill and the Gulf of Mexico still has not been restored.
1116 2018-06-27 21:32:28 Brent crude rose by US$1.31 or 1.7% to US$77.62 a barrel, and the US Nymex rose by US$2.23 or 3.6% to US$70.53 a barrel.

1125 2018-06-27 21:31:20 @JRubinBlogger Wow, you had the unmitigated gall to say the Iraqis said they had WMD, and that justified the war for oil and occupation. So that's the Republican excuse now? That's just like saying - she deserved to get raped and murdered, look at what she was wearing. The worst!

1127 2018-06-27 21:31:10 Perfect observation.  You see the failure Venezuela is on our side of the world with arguably the largest oil reserves and people still don't see socialism just doesn't work.

1141 2018-06-27 21:29:55 $WTI : We will always have Vienna! LOL! Oil still a runner. Today intraday entry point just above $71.22 (tested 3 times at least).
1142 2018-06-27 21:29:40 Not sure the precise percentage these days but biggest markets for palm oil are India, Indonesia and China, where it is not only an ingredient in packaged foods but the everyday cooking oil for many people.

1163 2018-06-27 21:27:09 Have a ladder inlayed in the bed of the truck. Now, if carrying a ladder in the truck, you have to ensure space for 5 gallon buckets of liquid, ie. Hydraulic fluid, oil, gas and paint for example. Now usually the only space for them is in the middle of the bed, due to ladders.

1180 2018-06-27 21:24:49 Try emu soap and Argan oil. Made a huge difference.  No more meds for me.

1182 2018-06-27 21:24:37 I always get really nervous when I take my car in for an oil change. I’m terrified they are going to ask me something and I’ll be like “I don’t know anything about cars, man.”
1183 2018-06-27 21:24:31 @TulsiPress Do not forget the Gulf war veterans who were 200 miles downwind of the burning oil wells. After 6 months of day looking like night, vomiting my lunch, washing my soaked oil ridden uniforms and suffering ill effects including GWS.

1194 2018-06-27 21:23:39 No. It's not. Until the physical advances starts. I went for a scholarship Exams back then in school days and on that day it rained so so heavily on our way back. The oil company called me to know how my days was, thinking I do was travelling back to Benin from Lagos same day.

1208 2018-06-27 21:22:08 Oil based pigment might be worth trying or perhaps treating the feather in a light solvent or alcohol that might break the repellent coating on the feather?
1209 2018-06-27 21:21:50 I use regen oil which is a cheap but still v effective alternative to Bio oil. I feel so much more confident in my skin now because of it 
1210 2018-06-27 21:21:44 not showering your body and not washing your hair are extremely different.... your skins pores get clogged and full of oil in a normal day, so showering every day is healthy, where as hair needs those oils building up so washing it every 3 days is healthy 
1211 2018-06-27 21:21:43 They are all being wiped out for the harvest of palm oil, I wouldn't worry too much.

1222 2018-06-27 21:20:56 Peppermint oil. Peppermint tea. If you have one, a muscle relaxer. If you can force sleep somehow, do it.
1223 2018-06-27 21:20:43 What's the difference between the likes of the Holland & Barrett oil and what Billy Caldwell's mother had taken off her?
Currently in Amsterdam and it's everywhere. Wasn't sure to risk buying some and flying home but then saw H&B do it.

1241 2018-06-27 21:17:40 Since you tend to get a warning / prodrome / aura, you should benefit from a med called Frova (frovatriptan). Not an opioid. Taken asap it will help. (If you get no warning it is too late to take). As a preventative, CBD oil is good - the best is Avidekel from MedReLeaf Oils.

1250 2018-06-27 21:17:01 I’m assaulted grass fed butter and an MCT oil like coconut oil. Extremely high and good fat. 400 Calories to start the day. Contributes greatly to wait a loss. It’s part of a ketogenic diet.

1274 2018-06-27 21:14:01 I understood that Norway had a sovereign wealth fund of around USD 800 billion mainly because of oil revenues. A population of

1298 2018-06-27 21:11:04 And probably a lot more expensive if I have to take 2 or 3 softgels to get the same amount of Liquid Cod Liver Oil.  The images are so small I can't see how much is in each softgel.  Please bring back the 16 oz bottles.
1299 2018-06-27 21:10:51 I have been a vegetarian since age 9 (minus a few years of pregnancy and nursing with boy #2) I’m seriously considering taking a high quality fish oil...
Have you been 
in this situation? 
What did you do?
1300 2018-06-27 21:10:50 $DWT Dear Oil you got your 73 pls take a breather and come down to 68s
1301 2018-06-27 21:10:49 ever lose money learning how to cook oil base? Kevin Gates has
1302 2018-06-27 21:10:47 So the whole issue was about oil in south Sudan and not to mediate for a genuine peace.
1303 2018-06-27 21:10:46 "Ice is fit for burns, they say, but a swipe of oil does as well."-Carmine
1304 2018-06-27 21:10:39 No he didn't. He fought for some oil Barron's access to capital and then bastardized your father's brave service so that what your father gave to this country could be exploited for political gain.
1305 2018-06-27 21:10:33 Lavender oil, aloe vera, and coconut oil do SO MUCH MORE than they’re given credit for
1306 2018-06-27 21:10:26 Mmmm, those sound delicious. I love the sun-dried tomatoes that come packed in oil. They immediately boost most meat based sandwiches.
1307 2018-06-27 21:10:26 Dylan cut his Afro off to look presentable for job interviews, now he got a job in the oil field and they're making him shave his beard. Oh and for since his hair is too short they shaved a chunk out of his head for his drug test.

1311 2018-06-27 21:09:55 The proposed oil pipes will go through Somaliland to Berbera port, great day for Ethiopia and Somaliland
1312 2018-06-27 21:09:54 i love summer cause i always smell like chlorine and coconut oil <3
1313 2018-06-27 21:09:53 I bought '5' 8ths and dog treats with CBD oil for 70$ for my mom.
1314 2018-06-27 21:09:50 The oil!
1315 2018-06-27 21:09:25 Trump is deplorable. But Bush was way worse. Way more needless death and destruction. Swerving the war on terror into Iraq. Destabilizing a region with a non-UN backed war that turned Al-Qaeda from a club into an international terror cult. Cheney profiting from Golan Heights oil
1316 2018-06-27 21:09:25 Beard Oil x Condition that shit
1317 2018-06-27 21:09:23 Despite going to the gym and gettin my oil changed... im STILL in the black hole of conspiracy theories
1318 2018-06-27 21:09:14 They have been buying real commo like gold and oil. Maybe creating some extra real asset “pools of safety”.
They can always convert in another currency. The amount of investments they have been doing on emerging markets can be a great use of the extra USD.
1319 2018-06-27 21:09:12 monday: trump announces space force
wednesday: oil discovered in space
1320 2018-06-27 21:09:08 Oil and cars wasn’t even found and invented until the late 1800 and Nuclear Power plants were invented since 1954. Where the hell are you getting this historical illiteracy from???
1321 2018-06-27 21:09:04 Trump 71 years old so by the time Obama reach 71 either 1 or 2 things gonna been than happen for Trump. He's in old age years add 15 years to that and even if he still here he won't remember being president. He know it and it burns him up
1322 2018-06-27 21:08:48 I didn’t want to wait for this oil change but I needed to get it done 
1323 2018-06-27 21:08:31 You are a man full of Islamic understanding. I have presented you with verifiable evidence. 
Please how much of oil revenue does Lagos add to Nigerian coffers? Answers?
1324 2018-06-27 21:08:30 Just got that young oil change my baby riding out now lol
1325 2018-06-27 21:08:24 Omg why does it take 2 hours for a oil change?!? Like Lawwwwwwwwwwd

1328 2018-06-27 21:08:10 The view need some oil king magic!!
1329 2018-06-27 21:07:38 Whats your deal? Do you hate the USA? Do you love Big Oil and Old Auto? You do realize that Tesla is Americas only chance to set EV supply chains in The USA. Ford has abandon the car market and all other Old Auto has outsourced their EV drive tech to Korea and China!
1330 2018-06-27 21:07:30 Looks like me looking under the hood of my ex-wifes truck and her asking me why is it oil light flashing on my truck...

1331 2018-06-27 21:07:28 It will NEVER be on the list. Remember DT had his first overseas trip there and put his hands on the glowing orb. Oil and money talk.

1333 2018-06-27 21:07:13 I get my oil changed when the light in my car comes on and tells me to get it changed. I've bartended and waited tables, now manage a dominos where I employe delivery drivers.... some people of all ages tip poorly , and some people of all ages tip well. It's a pretty even mix.
1334 2018-06-27 21:06:46 Wrong assumption. Edible oil is essential food. #PalmOil has assured current supplies and even with this all food demand hasn’t been met. The future needs more edible oil and there’s no happy human future without PalmOil
1335 2018-06-27 21:06:33 @realDonaldTrump The most severe sanctions on history have come and America should do it according to the law, not just on paper. We are all up to ours, the oil embargo must be cut 100%, not a word less, not a word more.
1336 2018-06-27 21:06:30 Me: self, why don't you try CBD oil being you see a lot of testimonies about it working very well for people?
Well, long story short. I am excited to let y'all know I decided to be an affiliate with Hempworx!
1337 2018-06-27 21:06:23 Stay back handle the oil price cause oil is at record and oil price at gas station will increase higher.....thks to u
1338 2018-06-27 21:06:18 can't I just put tea tree oil on it?
1339 2018-06-27 21:06:16 Great list @CNBCFastMoney but what about Oil? $BP $CVX even @petenajarian sometime fave $XOM got some love on WTI oil pop. At what point will higher oil drag on consumer, and then possibly (more so) on Markets overall? @GuyAdami @timseymour @DavidSeaburg @MelissaLeeCNBC
1340 2018-06-27 21:06:15 I’ll still layer the kids up in their factor 50 to avoid the sun damage though. Myself, im daft and will use oil with a low factor because I tan very easily. Do as i say, not as I do 
1341 2018-06-27 21:06:11 slathering my body in coconut oil was great for my glowing summer hoe aesthetic this morning but now the UV index is 10 and i am feeling crispy and burnt
1342 2018-06-27 21:06:08 Ill put my name forward. 
Tanning oil and sleeveless tops are comulsory for all, other wise no start.
1343 2018-06-27 21:06:04 Bang/Kuntz level of matchmaking
1344 2018-06-27 21:05:54 you can't beat the sight of the traditional oil delivery truck in its natural surroundings
1345 2018-06-27 21:05:40 @MarkMeadows mr meadows you and the "freedom caucus" are no more than snake oil salesmen; you don't want the truth you want to protect a traitor an impeachment is in order
1346 2018-06-27 21:05:26 Hopefully not near northern deep water oil drillers.
1347 2018-06-27 21:05:23 You failing today at Kim new nuclear facilities, steel group suing u, china new trade war, eu start tariff, Harley CEO call u crazy, immigration bill fail in congress, democrat laughing at u, Toyota CEO told u car price increase due to steel, oil price at record, u all failure 
1348 2018-06-27 21:05:14 Idle threats. More deadlines have passed than in Iran nuclear deal. You're begging like Obama did. Its degrading and unseemly
1349 2018-06-27 21:05:07 The genesis of 'oil conflicts' though subtle.
1350 2018-06-27 21:05:03 I use homemade spray for the horses and it seems to work pretty well. It's made from cold tea, white vinegar and citronella oil. Other variations have lavender oil and some people put Dettol in too.
1351 2018-06-27 21:04:44 - OLIVE OIL
This is s more artificial way to achieve glowy skin but it does simply work for photos. Simply add a small amount on a cotton pad, and dab it on your face.  As simple as that 
1352 2018-06-27 21:04:36 Oga! I can see clearly u lack simple understanding, all i have to say is that don't  be brain washed by what people say. Do research pls. And stop bragging about SS oil both Lagos and anambra have too or they are also in SS?
1353 2018-06-27 21:04:32 I think baby oil should be required to have “no babies were harmed in the making of the product” on every bottle just to make sure they aren’t actually using babies to make it
1354 2018-06-27 21:04:31 $PIR Pier One 1.  If I hear omni channel one more time, I will scream.  "We are one quarter into our three plan of getting salaries as the company dwindles away to nothing".  Be positive man....do something !!
1355 2018-06-27 21:04:11 Oil drums in the Shed as you went in to put your pocket money. I went without Percy Daltons monkey nuts at quie a few home games. Martin Spencer accountant whatever happened to him? I still think our decline started that one week in 1972. Losing to Orient and Stoke in the cups..
1356 2018-06-27 21:03:51 Sanders endorsed HRC. Not his fault. It’s the idiots who either didn’t vote at all, voted Stein, or wrote-in Bernie despite his concession and endorsement.
1357 2018-06-27 21:03:46 They did, but then something happened in the lab and it all turned into oil
1358 2018-06-27 21:03:43 DID YOU REMEMBER TO REORDER YOUR CBD OIL?
1359 2018-06-27 21:03:39 i just ordered castor oil, a new phone case, and a bunch of hair products. treat yoself ladies

1362 2018-06-27 21:03:06 Remind me, @CurdsandEh, who is it that has commuted the most gun crime?  Illegal immigrants or good oil’ white American boys?
1363 2018-06-27 21:02:51 Plus, solar panels might displace some natural gas, but they don't displace oil. So, Mike's tweet is absurd (as always).
1364 2018-06-27 21:02:48 @mousquemere I hope to visit Woods Hole one day, love New England and nautical history; I understand there is a building there where whale oil candles were made.

1389 2018-06-27 21:00:23 Shameful @mpcelina @cathmckenna libs promised end to oil subsidies
1390 2018-06-27 21:00:02 The butterbags of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, jazz unestablished a howitzers whorehouse team. They should always man oil together and deficit the Democrats, who stuff Cans Borders and Bird-Washing Crime, howitzers into the future .and..
1391 2018-06-27 20:59:54 I’ve tried both the tea tree oil and lavender tips in the sensitive skin formula. I got a rash from the tea tree oil one and neither worked for body odor (the lavender one lasted all day but I just smelled like flowers AND b.o. by midday) 
1392 2018-06-27 20:59:53 Do hot oil + conditioning treatments weekly!!! (If you can sit under the dryer) Or try the egg & mayo one! those help w dryness a lotttt
1393 2018-06-27 20:59:44 @DGodfatherMoody will you be wearing a pair of speedos and covered in oil to get the ultimate tan on the weekend calling the race. Lol!! Be safe out here Moody you and all the others do an amazing job
1394 2018-06-27 20:59:44 We will scrap the unfair council tax. 
We will cut class sizes. 
Once in a lifetime/ generation vote. 
We will all be richer in an independent Scotland. 
Oil is just a bonus. 
Shall I go on?
1395 2018-06-27 20:59:11 Igual se dice vice, no bice.
1396 2018-06-27 20:58:59 So ...... that would be the answer to ‘Where doesn’t jet fuel come from?’. 

The answer I was looking for was Oil. 
Just plain old Canadian crude.
1397 2018-06-27 20:58:55 Two very close BO3's to qualify for DH Masters Stockholm, still need to find our fifth gear from LAN tho, time to oil up the machine and fine tune it before the Minor CQ. GGWP @3DMAXGaming and @SpaceSoldiersTR

1399 2018-06-27 20:57:45 I deserve prickly heat tbh since I’ve been sittin outside covered in olive oil
1400 2018-06-27 20:57:44 Hot take: Vince Russo is fucking annoying.  The irony of a booker complaining about getting injured in a match when he was already suffering from post concussion syndrome when he has the power to literally book any scenario he chooses is richer than a Texas Oil baron.
1401 2018-06-27 20:57:14 Agreed. For the last two years the prevailing view was that we are awash in oil and USA shale was the swing producer. Don’t hear that refrain now. Market is tight. Will stay that way for the next two years.
1402 2018-06-27 20:57:13 Yar n league ny ghlt bjli  bnai hy ... Achi bjli kpk main pti ny bnaai hy :) ,aur ye keh rhy hain oil sy ni bnani chahiye thi.tu pti ny jaisy kpk main dam bna diya hyna ...
1403 2018-06-27 20:56:59 I also put them in my lotions,on my pillow,at night and in a spray bottle to put all over my body. The other thing I found are essential oil Epson salt for baths. They really help too.
1404 2018-06-27 20:56:57 Grantham. Basically saying oil may get brief bounce, but structurally finished. This seems to be view of several large long only shops
1405 2018-06-27 20:56:44 Presidential election year? I checked, it's not. 
Your mind is going Bern.
1406 2018-06-27 20:56:08 @sell_organic - Sells organic skin care products, organic perfumes with 15-20% oil concentrate.Sells puff puff mix that also has various flavors like chocolate chips, white chocolate chips or raisins.

@Chopstix_grills is your best small chops chick
1407 2018-06-27 20:56:03 Which doesn’t contain 70% vegetable oil unlike what we perceive as chocolate
1408 2018-06-27 20:55:48 Mr. President @realDonaldTrump and Secretary Bolton @AmbJohnBolton, what financial incentive or assurance can we offer Russia in exchange for returning Crimea back to the Ukraine? Oil deal? Or...?
1409 2018-06-27 20:55:45 Grab your short term gasoline/fuel needs ASAP. Holiday ahead & EIA Report showed largest weekly reduction of crude oil inventories this year.
1410 2018-06-27 20:55:41 Hahaha I really like their restore oil! And this bar I will tell you about after one week of using :p
1411 2018-06-27 20:55:11 not a tweet i replied to something called oil

1413 2018-06-27 20:55:08 Kose Speedy Cleansing Oil is my fave! TheFaceShop's rice one is good too.  I also use good old pond's cold cream for taking off heavy makeup
1414 2018-06-27 20:55:03 @JustinTrudeau hates the west because the West hated his dad for his social engineering and communist nationalism of oil. Does not help that most western people are independent minded and don’t like big gov. control that liberals love.
1415 2018-06-27 20:54:43 2/3 If this continues, real jobs of real people will be gone, in Canada but also in America. CO food producers, KS auto parts makers, MT furniture makers, WY oil & gas suppliers & UT aerospace manufacturers will shed jobs due to higher input costs and restricted export markets.
1416 2018-06-27 20:54:42 Mega Man and fair go together like oil and water
1417 2018-06-27 20:54:40 Well remember that the VAST majority of oil revenue goes to Libyan citizens (all over Libya) in terms of salaries - so blocking oil  means blocking the salaries Libyans live on.
1418 2018-06-27 20:54:35 Well clean it for a start, slice it into half centimetre discs, throw em in a bag with olive oil, herbs de provence and garlic salt, let it marinate while you pour yourself a glass of wine, then either roast in the oven or stick on the barbecue (either one works tbh) (1/2)
1419 2018-06-27 20:54:34 Once you cook it on separate pots and use different oil it can still be halal
1420 2018-06-27 20:54:16 Ты там поаккуратнее, береги себя
1421 2018-06-27 20:54:11 It's one of my favorite snacks too! Except I bake them with a splash of olive oil and then curry powder and salt. When they toast, they smell DELICIOUS. :)
1422 2018-06-27 20:53:55 Hey Trevor- thanks so much for advising Hillary to throw away the anti-fracking vote      It cost her the election, surely.  Im betting you’re happy you can go play golf with Justice Kennedy and the oil and gas billionaires who pay you.
1423 2018-06-27 20:53:52 Tire plus in Riverdale is the wig fr .... 2 hour wait for a oil change .... gtfoh
1424 2018-06-27 20:53:51 Well you're out there maybe you should take some time to go check out that oil spill that you're responsible for
1425 2018-06-27 20:53:41 So does the butter I use, it's got olive oil and real butter in it 
1426 2018-06-27 20:53:40 Just got super sticky ass road oil in my beard. Probs gonna have to shave. Kms
1427 2018-06-27 20:53:31 Bin laden died in 2002. Anyone who believes the official narrative on 9/11 and the subsequent murder of millions is mentally ill, brain washed beyond reach. If the USA stopped invading other countries for oil and Machiavellian, geo political ruses the world would be a safer place
1428 2018-06-27 20:53:20 Y’all ever do one small thing & suddenly get the urge to get your whole life together??? 

Today I got my oil changed and suddenly feel like I could conquer the world
1429 2018-06-27 20:53:18 I use CBD oil and that has helped tremendously! I like when people check in on me and bring me food.

1431 2018-06-27 20:53:11 Went on tour ? With the rate  bafana bafana going down the Coca-Cola fifa ranking, they will soon discover crude oil.. no wonder your country competing with Sri-lanka on who will be on 131st for the month of June
1432 2018-06-27 20:53:07 I stand corrected on money, he did how ever give them 400 million in heavy fuel oil & the deal also called for 4 billion for 2 light water reactors which were never finished. He may have given a photo op to Kim but I really don't want to think about what will happen if he renigs
1433 2018-06-27 20:53:05 I’ve used the oil/balm but I’ve read that vaping it is the fastest way for your body to absorb it so I’m really curious to give it a try. I’m skeptical about that too bc that’s the reason why I don’t smoke, I want the good shit (hence why I haven’t just got one from ziggys)
1434 2018-06-27 20:53:00 Data is the new oil.
1435 2018-06-27 20:52:59 This country was suppose to be a melting pot. turned out more to be like water and oil.
1436 2018-06-27 20:52:52 My house HAS to smell good. I got a scented candle, incense & a scent oil burning. With my window open to let that fresh breeze come through. 
1437 2018-06-27 20:52:52 anything can be a salad dressing if you add enough olive oil
1438 2018-06-27 20:52:41 Until it dries out... then you have NO lubricant.  WD40 then machine oil... perfect combo.
1439 2018-06-27 20:52:38 Tissue oil on the face.  Noo thou.
Where's sun screen? 20 years l8r your face will thank you.
1440 2018-06-27 20:52:38 They All fell for the Goods a SNAKE OIL SALESMAN, like Trump, Promised them..
It's Sad...He did the same CON-MAN stunt, while Dealing with Real estate
1441 2018-06-27 20:52:28 Hahahaha history only started for them when the oil money came in 
1442 2018-06-27 20:52:28 Despite all you say we had feelings of communality 
Quite enjoyed power cuts
Watching Blue Peter learning to make lights from oil/water, cork string
Quite cosy evenings 
Unions were able to stand up to Gov
1443 2018-06-27 20:52:23 2- We shall never succumb again to harsh tarrifs that makes us hostage to foreign country’s, instead, finance the reconstruction of our new borders with Bekaa’s oil.
1444 2018-06-27 20:52:14 Extra white sauce, Extra Mozzarella, Parmesan, Goat cheese, Salami, Pepperoni, Sausage, Meatball, Bacon... olive oil drizzle.. then topped with Parmesan, Oregano, and Crushed Red Pepper
1445 2018-06-27 20:52:07 Si tu prend la peine d'écouter les trucs que tu retweet, tu vas te rendre compte que tu pinailles inutilement. et puis #Trump n'a rien a voir avec l'invasion de l'Irak ?
De plus il tape sur les #Bush comme un sourd ! hehehe  take the oil !
1446 2018-06-27 20:52:02 Crack a egg and mix it with your shampoo, and to condition it put coconut oil in it, put a cap over it and use a blow dryer let it sit them rinse it
1447 2018-06-27 20:51:45 I mostly want to know how you get that dirty in a shop that clean. WTF are you doing, showering in oil? 
1448 2018-06-27 20:51:34 #IwannaknowCrissy what type of  straighteners do you use when you straighten your hair?
And do you use any hair oil before straightening your hair ?
1449 2018-06-27 20:51:28 That's what I stick to nowadays. I've got my coconut oil/stevia coffee in the morning, my fried eggs, my kale smoothie and then just meat and veggies. Occasional bit of fruit or grain and water, lots of water and lemon/ginger tea.
1450 2018-06-27 20:51:19 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
1451 2018-06-27 20:51:17 use kerosine oil or wd40 to remove rust if not then use sand paper
1452 2018-06-27 20:51:13 Oil UP?
1453 2018-06-27 20:51:03 Since they repeatedly disobeyed a clear directive to step back, they’re probably fortunate. 

What’s with all the “laugh until you cry” emojis? Am I supposed to be embarrassed or something? Do you think it means you’ve scored some sort of point? Lol!
1454 2018-06-27 20:50:59 Yes, definitely recommend. I also hear essential oils have amazing therapeutic properties and I take #CBD oil for my back pain/sciatica.
1455 2018-06-27 20:50:54 Too late. Trump has “Space Force” to stop anyone leaving the planet. The same planet he allowed the EPA head to open the coastal waters around the US for oil drilling. Except off the coast of Florida cuz it would ruin Mara Lago view.
1456 2018-06-27 20:50:47 Bio oil actually works wonders on your face . Been using it every night for a week and my skin is 10000 x better!
1457 2018-06-27 20:50:42 My period has never smelt like prawn chips before hon, make her drink more water, eat more plants & wash vagina w just water no soap then seal w coconut oil w a little drop of peppermint essential oil. Also, rashuns or big guns would be more even trade for hot cheetos
1458 2018-06-27 20:50:42 I live for using stuff in ways they’re not meant to be used 
dabbing baby oil also looks lekker
1459 2018-06-27 20:50:41 Peppermint oil, rub into your temples and forehead. Always works for me

1467 2018-06-27 20:50:00 My bet is Oil. Bonds have figured out where Oil is headed next even if Oil hasn't realized it yet 
1468 2018-06-27 20:49:52 basically i saute'd in a pan with garlic and chili oil uncovered for idk, less than 10 mins. i'd appreciate softer next time, how do you cook yours?
1469 2018-06-27 20:49:43 I use them for both pain relief and comfort. Also great for relaxing. Lavender oil is my fave to put on joints. Also fennel externally to calm ibd flares. Young living make the best oils.
1470 2018-06-27 20:49:37 No Libyan benefits from Libyan oil, only the top people in the west and East governments who pretend to be fighting for control. Time to change this ugly tune.
1471 2018-06-27 20:49:36 @PetsatHome hi i got dog  peanut butter from your North Shields shop. Looking at the ingredients it has palm oil in it.   Palm oil is very toxic to dogs and can cause vomiting and diarrhoea but can also cause kidney damage and liver failure. *****WHY SELL THIS*****

1476 2018-06-27 20:48:42 @EnergySecMoniz @realDonaldTrump oil prices have soared since the OPEC meeting to keep prices down. As we head into driving season, any plans to move ahead with plan to sell half of the strategic oil reserves?
1477 2018-06-27 20:48:37 Sold USDCAD @ 1.3370, higher oil prices, rate hike more likely than in the upcoming meeting, and poloz not backing down in the Q & A, makes for a beautiful set up
1478 2018-06-27 20:48:36 There are several brands of oil pastels, and each is good for a different type of application-generally, less expensive brands are harder and good for initial layers. Senneliers, the best, are good for top layers.
1479 2018-06-27 20:48:27 And now.. ... .. plus oil and gas.

1482 2018-06-27 20:48:14 How much  crude oil is available?Is it worth the PM's time? Either you are not telling us the whole story  or the PM has unparallaled craving for optics.

1488 2018-06-27 20:47:36 Sadly, this is what it's going to take, as predicted: total disenchantment with the snake oil husker and his bandits when the full catastrophe of reality slaps them in the face. It's a brutal way to get woke that's also an opportunity for effective activism.
1489 2018-06-27 20:47:36 Yes, of course we will make a lot of noise about the app when it comes out! Meanwhile, have a look at @chesterzoo 's palm oil pages where many products are presented.

1503 2018-06-27 20:45:51 I’ll wash my face first with warm water then put witch hazel over it then moisturize it with Shea butter. 

With rose oil same as rinse you face with warm water then you rub the oil on. I like the rose oil better cause you won’t have to do anything to your face for some weeks.
1504 2018-06-27 20:45:51 Adulting is getting invited to sunsplash after work but having to go get an oil change instead lmfao

1509 2018-06-27 20:45:33 @cbcallinaday So when oil is cheap we're told gas is traded separately and that's why gas prices stay up. Oil goes up and oh yes gas prices go up more because of it...
1510 2018-06-27 20:45:32 Yes it’s there generating revenues now but heaven knows how long before Trudeau’s antipathy towards oil and gas and crass mismanagement by the new owners will shut that baby down too.

1513 2018-06-27 20:45:15 It's entirely your choice if you want to avoid palm oil. We just advise people that it won't make a difference to what is happening on the ground and may even be counter-productive. A better strategy is to push for more sustainable production to make resonsible palm oil the norm.
1514 2018-06-27 20:45:02 I want to commission an oil painting of this photo. It's majestic.
1515 2018-06-27 20:44:59 Glad I grew facial hair because slapping beard oil on a baby face just made me look like I just finished eating BarB-Q ribs

1521 2018-06-27 20:44:24 Nah definitely not weird its common to smell your own hair especially if it smells pretty  like I use coconut oil in mine and I love the smell so I take a sniff all the time 
1522 2018-06-27 20:43:59 That’s fine I’m cool with that but I work as a Drilling consultant in the oil field and different oil companies hire me to make sure there wells are drilled they pay me great money! If I work I expect my day rate when they pay me they expect me to show up that’s how it works

1531 2018-06-27 20:42:54 Telling: “There is no way we can be a security threat to the oil we have protected and guarded for years. So the specialised and additional security personnel (protecting oil) should head to Kapedo and secure our people,”

1534 2018-06-27 20:42:27 I find the coconut oil just makes it quite greasy and makes the frizz shiny....
1535 2018-06-27 20:42:19 We have a foot powder for stinky sweaty feet and there's a bunch of ingredients but it might as well just be tea tree oil and kaolin for how much it smells like nothing else at all
1536 2018-06-27 20:42:13 А что случилось? Из-за чего они? У самой такое было. Дыхание помогает, вода, резкие запахи. Если есть кому выговориться вообще отлично. Всё-таки лучше когда под рукой есть человек, который успокоит
1537 2018-06-27 20:41:53 Agreed. GMO note a good summary of a lot of views out there, i.e. we might get quick oil spike but fundamentally oil is dead and gone.
1538 2018-06-27 20:41:52 Whoever you are, shut up. You fell for a snake oil salesman pitch. You didn’t do your job so pay the bill

1541 2018-06-27 20:41:10 And to clarify, Scott Pruiit Head of EPA, Rick Perry head of the dept of energy, just for starters. Our Gov't IMO is owned by dark money and lobbyists, the Oil & gas Industry is close to owning the courts. In a time when climate change is at a point of no return,not a good thing!
1542 2018-06-27 20:41:07 Just had 2spoons of caster oil and I hope it works. The first and the last time I had it I was 39wks pregnant and it did not do the things
1543 2018-06-27 20:41:03 I did that once with a bottle of olive oil...
And my pressure cooker blew damson juice ( it’s purple ) all over the ceiling...

1545 2018-06-27 20:40:41 Ohhh girl i feel this! Me & mine are like oil and water at times. It lowkey makes me sad a tiny bit but i never know if i should try to fix it or just take it for what it is lol
1546 2018-06-27 20:40:40 Oil change and two fresh tires just in time to log 786 miles tomorrow from Berkeley to Seattle.

1547 2018-06-27 20:40:23 Did Steve Jobs at times appear misleading to the public? Did he fight with press? I think Elon is a great role model. We’ve all said things we regret but unlike us he is under the microscope and has plenty of foes (big oil, shorts, big 3, dealers, etc)

1549 2018-06-27 20:40:15 I work in an Italian restaurant and I was genuinely confused as to if olive oil was made out of olives or for olives! Phahahah!!!!

1551 2018-06-27 20:40:10 You don’t support the people of Iran. You want to control Iran and steal their oil.

1554 2018-06-27 20:40:03 Zendaya wore dreadlocks and was ridiculed and told that her hair looked like it smelled like petroleum oil but when others wear a similar style they are called fashion icons chic etc. It will not help unless a black person was to wear them and be called beautiful for once

1557 2018-06-27 20:39:36 This is my problem - I would hate to think though that by boycotting Palm Oil completely, even RSPO certified, we were contributing in some way to the expansion of illegal plantations! What to do??Many contradictory views lead to confusion! Thanks again for taking the time 
1558 2018-06-27 20:39:31 Why is it that you want to reference dems as not patriotic? Did we not serve in the military and die for this country? You silver tongued snake oil salesman.  The only reason it feels like Halloween is that Michael Myers is running the US.
1559 2018-06-27 20:39:23 Looks harmless to me after my opiates & my great grandparents needing Wizard of Oz oil for the joints. Courts are going to be clogged figuring legal tickets now over this 10,000 year old cultivated plant. #GrowYourOwnTherapy #StopTheStigma #ACMPR
1560 2018-06-27 20:39:20 There really should be no surprise on the move on oil or the draw down.. July 4th weekend is the busiest gas time of the year

1563 2018-06-27 20:38:59 Just say no to snake oil salespeople.
1564 2018-06-27 20:38:58 I assumed their diet is just berries and olive oil at this point
1565 2018-06-27 20:38:58 Oil companies' raison d'etre is to make money thru resource exploitation. Do you know of any resource companies that are environmentally responsible?
1566 2018-06-27 20:38:57 honestly still upset no one is talking about the 230,000 gallons of oil that spilled in Iowa over the weekend

1568 2018-06-27 20:38:43 Haven't despaired this much since gallons of oil were being pumped into the gulf hourly
1569 2018-06-27 20:38:26 Unless we're handing out money to big oil and multinational corporations with lots of lobbyists. Then socialism is awesome and the free market is a disaster.
1570 2018-06-27 20:38:23 We’re looking more and more like a runaway oil train.
1571 2018-06-27 20:38:11 Hey @Walmart went to South Broken Arrow #OK location to get #oil changed for trip to #STL - came out of hotel rm to find pool of oil! $30 #later to find out your #employees dont know how to use a #wrench and tighten a #drain plug! #neveragain
1572 2018-06-27 20:38:03 I should never listen to my brother.
both us put baby oil on because he said we would get a "tan". 
28 fucking degrees and we stuck on baby oil fucking baby oil. 
Never again will I listen to that ejit.
1573 2018-06-27 20:37:58 Ask Dickson, the Governor of Bayelsa State why he is owing salaries of workers, Resource control & Restructuring he is canvassing , no capital devt with the oil derivation & Monthly Allocation he collects from The FG . Governors 2 be accountable after their tenure. @MBuhari
1574 2018-06-27 20:37:48 But...how did you know???
1575 2018-06-27 20:37:45 It’s not up to me at all. Fortunately we have laws in place to help make those determinations; both civil & criminal.
1576 2018-06-27 20:37:39 I need people to  make sure #RuthBaderGinsburg has her vitamins, naps, lavender oil,  etc.  Please stay well, Justice. We need you. #SCOTUS

1580 2018-06-27 20:37:11 I can see him try to “prove” that fi the Earth is flat, or the gays are destroying society; 

or maybe (more probably) using EPA funds to develop fracking opportunities for his Oil buddies

Which wld explain the amount of secrecy!

1582 2018-06-27 20:36:38 very much this. Part of what slows it down is the moisture released by the onions. Salting onions first also prevents absorption of oil and faster release of liquid. turn on hood to help vent moisture.
1583 2018-06-27 20:36:31 I agree with Judith on the clove oil. Also warm salt water rinses.

1585 2018-06-27 20:36:15 If taxpayers don't pay the costs and the oil industry doesn't pay the costs, then who does?  Is Trump going to build a giant sea wall to hold back the oceans, and get the mermaids to pay for it?

1589 2018-06-27 20:35:50 To be honest, its true that the auditing of some growers leading to certification has been substandard, and tracing palm oil supply chains is difficult. It isn't easy for a consumer to know for sure their product has been produced as sustainable as possible.
1590 2018-06-27 20:35:45 Is it possible economy is slowing precipitously? 10 yr at 2.83; DJUA going higher, other stock averages almost testing their lows. Dollar strong because of Yuan weakness. Banks and financials bleeding. Claim that economy is strong is fake? Oil rising even though economy. is weak.
1591 2018-06-27 20:35:44 Kanti why you didn't pour oil
1592 2018-06-27 20:35:40 We get different news IMHO, but here its clear that Canada is only the heaviest case, as the US largest oil source, as well as gas to very rural areas, this for decades. Medveded just today called for a united EU, China + Russian retaliation against the US, investment stops.

1596 2018-06-27 20:35:10 i agree with you. but whether or not you want the US to be the one exploring for oil, gas, & minerals in the Arctic, i think having a few icebreakers is critical national security infrastructure. also, if done right, it could mean more federal dollars in rural AK.
1597 2018-06-27 20:34:53 It was 97 bucks to get my oil changed..is that high? For Texas?

1609 2018-06-27 20:33:35 The Dems won't undo anything. Obama oversaw eight years of oil expansion with little recourse. Stop living in a fantasy world! 

The only way the Dems will "undo" anything is if progressive leftists take them over. Otherwise they will always enable right-wingers.

1643 2018-06-27 20:31:07 You realize more terrorists that have actually affected the United States came from countries like Saudi Arabia that are not on the list, right?

Using the same ratio, iran will sell its oil at $10 to $15 now.

We're simply overpopulated. Math. Stretched sustainability, near maxed. Oceans Not limitless! Smart, firm, humane fixes. Eyes on tomorrow.
1704 2018-06-27 20:22:14 @chedetofficial Hi there is tons of waste foods per day which can recycle as fertilizer supply to oil palms plantations.
As far as I knew our fertilizers buying from middle East countries.
1705 2018-06-27 20:22:12 My organisation, Orangutan Land Trust, like most organisations involved in this issue, does not support a blanket boycott of palm oil. The best thing you can do is communicate with brands and retailers that you want deforestation-free Certified Sustainable Palm Oil.

1712 2018-06-27 20:21:40 It's a matter of both to me. I've constantly been saddened by the loss of life over the damn oil at the same time the continuous rise in inflation affects us all and does lead to loss of life when people have to choose between medicine, medical treatment or food.

1725 2018-06-27 20:20:03 Prepping baked potatoes is basically like a spa treatment right? Little sea salt, little olive oil.

1730 2018-06-27 20:19:17 If you sell drugs, you’re stimulating the US economy. If you go fight a war for oil, you cost us money, especially if you die. Selling drugs is better for us than serving in the military at this point. You are the bad guy. Military conscription should be unconstitutional.
1731 2018-06-27 20:19:17 "Should Democrats take money from the military industrial complex?" The answer to that question should be an immediate and loud "NO!", not "Well look ... Republican's with their constant war boners love that bomb and oil money though.

1734 2018-06-27 20:18:59 I recommend something with high linoleic acid content and low comedogenic rating! (High vitamin E content and won’t clog your pores) - Argan and sunflower oil for example

Also papaya soap is amazing for this and you can make natural papaya masks!

1740 2018-06-27 20:17:38 I can attest to the real oil thing. I thought I could go the TJ Maxx route and I broke out in hives. I’ll never make that mistake again. Plus, if they aren’t therapeutic grade, they simply won’t do the job.

1746 2018-06-27 20:16:54 Not saying oil can’t go down despite Iranian oil being curtailed. Other factors play a role too. Just sayin’ if you (Donald) think you won’t have an impact on price because you got Saudis to step in in lieu of Iran, you just don’t fully understand how this market works.

Islam in Nigeria has the license to kill. The evidence is there. Sharia riots, prophet Muhammad cartoon riots, current herdsmen terrorism, etc. The fact that nothing has been done to the perpetrators show that Muslims are licensed to kill

Or dead horse. Can only beat it so long before it gets old. Just a clue fauxcahantas, this is like last on my list of pressing issues now.
1840 2018-06-27 20:06:57 Put castor oil on your eyelashes at night if you want them to grow!!! I did it one time and see a huge difference
1841 2018-06-27 20:06:54 Hi! Those flakes are oil that melt and mix into the muffins helping to create that muffin consistency and flavor. They have always been in the cups but we did recently change the oil flakes slightly in the recipe and this may be the first cup you are getting of the updated recipe
1842 2018-06-27 20:06:49 We are only part of Ethiopia on the maps. Stop deluding yourself and stop wasting your time you will not receive a drip of our oil.
1843 2018-06-27 20:06:48 I actually found it in Walmart, I use the Argan Oil ones to help my curls and I don’t even need a leave in conditioner after. It’s not that strong a scent actually, and I just found out I have sensitive skin.
1844 2018-06-27 20:06:41 Saudi-US warplanes hit Al-Khamseen fuel station of the oil company in Duraihemi district in #Hodeidah, west of #Yemen, with 4 raids on 5-2-2016 #CoalitionCrimesInHodeidah
1845 2018-06-27 20:06:17 No problem! Try to get something that has rosehip oil. That helps the skin A LOT! It rejuvenates it :,) good luck!
1846 2018-06-27 20:06:13 Can't Sleep? Apply some lavender oil to your temples to help you relax and fall asleep.
1847 2018-06-27 20:06:01 Oh so now I gotta be willing to die for some rich Republican’s oil in order to “deserve” to be here?
1848 2018-06-27 20:05:49 It at least initially tastes good and smells good in oil and garlic
1849 2018-06-27 20:05:45 I tell tell you for fucking real baby oil does not take off your fake tan...I’m more patchy than every before 
1850 2018-06-27 20:05:44 I Have enough problems questioning the bloggers in oil country ;)
1851 2018-06-27 20:05:39 coconut oil + sun got me looking like the bronze honey dew babe I been striving to be all year 
1852 2018-06-27 20:05:30 The crotch of my shorts is covered in artichoke oil but it looks like I'm covered in sin.
1853 2018-06-27 20:05:22 just needs the proper underground rock conditions/types locally (+earth layers haven't been broken up like Swiss cheese by fracking). The whole goal of fracking is to break the rock to release trapped oil/gas. And all "exploration wells" done in QC to convince it's safe=leaking
1854 2018-06-27 20:05:22 You need something aggressive like some tracks from Tool or Rage Against the Machine to take out the aggression, and then some Midnight Oil to re-energize the fighting spirit.
1855 2018-06-27 20:05:18 If it makes the thought any less awful, someone tweeted to say that you soak up the oil with flour and then you can clean it up as normal. PHEW.
1856 2018-06-27 20:05:13 I need an oil change soon. Dallas  Houston  NOLA . Racking up these miles tomorrow
1857 2018-06-27 20:05:13 They kill for mere cows, imagine what they will do if they have crude oil..
1858 2018-06-27 20:05:07 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1859 2018-06-27 20:05:07 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
1860 2018-06-27 20:05:05 soaking wet from the rain and I have to sit here til they finish my oil change 
1861 2018-06-27 20:04:54 Look, do you believe that the NRA, or big oil has influenced the Republican GOP RNC,?

They have by contributing
 $ money & then asking for influenced agenda's & favors.

So is it REALLY so hard to understand that through disguised contributions to the GOP, PUTIN did also.
1862 2018-06-27 20:04:53 Screw makeup wipes and cotton pads...they pull your skin. Convert to double cleansing with oil and water cleansers. I have never been the same since 
1863 2018-06-27 20:04:42 They are getting together to figure out how to get us back in Iraq so they can get the oil!
1864 2018-06-27 20:04:39 oil
1865 2018-06-27 20:04:34 Nice job #POTUS . Stock Market is tumbling, Oil is surging. Not boding well for #USA . Do something quick
1866 2018-06-27 20:04:29 The grossest burps are fish oil tablets with coffee.
1867 2018-06-27 20:04:26 The enemies of progress in #SouthSudan are those that are now crying foul!! How comes we never heard their voices when millions of citizens have been suffering from violence yet now they are concerned about the oil fields?Spare us those fake cries!
1868 2018-06-27 20:04:11 Trying to find an oil leak in my Camry and I just can’t, and if it’s a head gasket that’s a whole ass life mission just to replace it,fuck foo
1869 2018-06-27 20:04:02 Looking for sympathy. The same song last 3 years but different lyrics now. If i see oil block,i will own,if u like don't own...lol.
1870 2018-06-27 20:03:59 I’ve got an oil for that lol 
1871 2018-06-27 20:03:53 I was Navy, ASW2.    The SRT Durango is pretty sweet. Our sales dept has sold two, neither has been in for service except for an oil change. Not sure why the drive is like. There’s a lot of modern Mopar forums out there and on FB. Maybe someone out there has one and talked on it.
1872 2018-06-27 20:03:44 A cheap mid-term strategy underwritten by Russia oil and aid for Kim.
1873 2018-06-27 20:03:28 Hey, I love you. I can't come over tonight but once I get my oil changed tomorrow morning, hugging you is first on my list
1874 2018-06-27 20:03:16 Yes ..a mosquito got me in Graves Park  .. Tea Tree oil zapped it 
1875 2018-06-27 20:03:15 All that damn motor oil in his hair
1876 2018-06-27 20:03:01 All politicians are the same Chief, the thumb Mina dude, in 6months period, food and oil prices went up , protest all 
over the country for undiliverd service , vukusenzele qabane
1877 2018-06-27 20:03:00 Topping up the oil in my car, guy walks past and says ‘you don’t see that every day!’ #modernfemale #cheekygit
1878 2018-06-27 20:02:50 unfortunately the closest thing we have is lavender oil
1879 2018-06-27 20:02:42 the only coconut oil in our house hold is mine .. care to explain?
1880 2018-06-27 20:02:40 DOW closes down 160, low of the day, despite rally on oil stocks. Lowest close in DOW since May 3.
1881 2018-06-27 20:02:35 Amen. My deceased loving mother was an artist who painted several oil portraits of Our Lady of Perpetual Help. This image brought tears to my eyes.
1882 2018-06-27 20:02:23 Thanks eric for booking a Oil And Filter Change with #Fiix for your Audi!  #Etobicoke #Toronto #Tech
1883 2018-06-27 20:02:22 Love Water Not Oil
1884 2018-06-27 20:02:19 Tripoli militia control is limited to Tripoli borders.They do benefit financially by guaranteeing security of VIPs but they are incapable of helping Jadran attack oil fields or wield power outside Tripoli. Military , economic & political control of West is done in Misrata.
1885 2018-06-27 20:02:05 Cooking naked for your man is all sexy and what not but what happens when the oil pops and burns your nipple, how sexy are you feeling then?
1886 2018-06-27 20:02:04 
No one tell my brother I'm paying someone to change my oil and air filters.
1887 2018-06-27 20:02:00 Nope, just the battery and then the oil connects to that. I got the battery from a regular smoke shop
1888 2018-06-27 20:01:59 Many USA citizens are brainwashed beyond the point of salvation. If you question the Military/ Oil industrialized complex narrative that is programmed into them, their only response is to be aggressive
#devolution
1889 2018-06-27 20:01:54 Damn fools need to be thanking God that security didn't shoot them down when they pushed Chao's lady guard - McConnell had a Capitol Police plainclothes guy with him as well, no doubt.
1890 2018-06-27 20:01:54 Y'all got a better program than Louisiana does. Only going to allow oil extracts and topicals here.
1891 2018-06-27 20:01:54 The Bush family has oil fields there, war on Saudi soil  was never going to happen.
1892 2018-06-27 20:01:44 That won’t be for another 30 years, if then. Buckle up.
1893 2018-06-27 20:01:32 Right, so, oil and gas play a very large and positive role and the filth left behind by violent protesters accomplished what?
Other than exposed them for the hypocrites they are, realy what did leavening all that filth laying around accomplish?
1894 2018-06-27 20:01:29 Let me guess...If, God forbid, an administration official were to be shot, you’re one of the guys who would blame the gun. 

Just stop. The current climate is insanely toxic. If this were happening to a Dem official, I’m fairly confident you would feel quite differently.
1895 2018-06-27 20:01:22 $arry my take on the stock downfall is investors don't think a ARRY is prepared for the rollout. Back to the oil change with a big company coming in and helping them with the rollout
1896 2018-06-27 20:01:19 A political newbian that was whipping up speciality coffee for hipsters a yr ago is an expert now? 
God help us.
1897 2018-06-27 20:01:17 I love coconut oil 
1898 2018-06-27 20:01:11 "The "shell" effect in Magic Shell is due to the presence of coconut oil and sunflower oil." Nice.

"Contrary to what many people believe, paraffin wax is not an ingredient of Magic Shell."

1899 2018-06-27 20:01:07 What is the main driver in the US is money. Our first step is moving to an FEC-controlled pool money for all federal elections. Starting with term limits is like changing your oil when you've got a rear tire falling off. It may not hurt, but it really isn't solving your problem.
1900 2018-06-27 20:01:02 Yelped with glee in my cubicle because I got a notification that my olive oil and shelf liner had been delivered and I feel so sad for me
1901 2018-06-27 20:01:01 The inversion method:

You lay upside down and massage ur scalp for about 5-15 min using oil or without oil. This allows blood circulation
1902 2018-06-27 20:00:54 I just want an oil change...not a summary of “what’s wrong”with my car 
1903 2018-06-27 20:00:53 Govt should just close the oil fields and tell the residents to push their county govt to deal with Tullow. National govt should pull out.
1904 2018-06-27 20:00:51 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;
You anoint my head with oil;
My cup runs over.
 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days of my life;
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord
Forever.
Psalm 23:5-6
1905 2018-06-27 20:00:51 The fight is against tarsands expansion and associated infrastructure that is dangerous for our climate, our environment and our communities. We are not puppets contracted to do someone else's bidding. We address Cdn oil b/c we are Canadians who care about these issues. Simple.
1906 2018-06-27 20:00:42 I have a reminder in my phone to get my oil changed on my car that I’ve been avoiding for 2 months now
1907 2018-06-27 20:00:36 Sorry but you will not receive 1 drip of oil from our land. Don't waste your time.
1908 2018-06-27 20:00:30 Try some clove oil on it. Works like anaesthetic and it will go numb. At you’ll get some relief until you can see your dentist.
1909 2018-06-27 20:00:18 Yeah he really short-armed that follow through. Good luck throwing that in December with those swirling winds inside Lucas Oil Stadium
1910 2018-06-27 20:00:14 You have no idea 
You know there was once a time when;
We were ahead of China and Singapore 
We were Africa's pride 
We were projected to be world power by now 
We were the top producers of cocoa and crude oil in Africa
The list goes on man 
Sure someone will add more to the list
1911 2018-06-27 20:00:08 As #oil and the energy sector rally 3% for second straight day, indices top out mid day to give back all gains of today and yesterday to reverse and close near lows.

1914 2018-06-27 19:59:44 They definitely deserve to drown. In boiling oil. #writingchat
1915 2018-06-27 19:59:43 I use half honey and half coconut oil, for 15 minutes, wash off with warm water. Pretty much every day as my skin is the desert.
1916 2018-06-27 19:59:22 argan oil actually makes everything better wow
1917 2018-06-27 19:59:18 The secret to happiness is to see all the marvels of the world,  and never to forget the drops of oil on the spoon.
1918 2018-06-27 19:59:13 あそこで1点入ってたらな(^^;)
1919 2018-06-27 19:59:12 Hoho found the terrorist defacing the Founding Fathers
1920 2018-06-27 19:58:44 By most accounts, not a nice guy who produced a dysfunctional family that only lately have some of them recovered from. 
Why celibrate him?
1921 2018-06-27 19:58:41 Castor oil dead makes me itch
1922 2018-06-27 19:58:38 I've been neglecting my car .. I really need to wash it and get an  oil change 
1923 2018-06-27 19:58:18 If a serious effort to educate people about birth control, palm oil harvesting for beauty products, fossil fuels, mining for precious metals and rocks, then the issues of deforestation is going to continue. There are good people, scientists, conservators etc, that teach the truth
1924 2018-06-27 19:58:02 Dang, what kind of olive oil?
1925 2018-06-27 19:57:59 HMM i feel like some people like their fries and some people Rly don't. i used to not like them when i was a kid but since i'm allergic to gluten now i can't eat fries just anywhere bc other places put a lot of shit in their fries but in n out just has potatoes, oil, and salt
1926 2018-06-27 19:57:52 I think I rather have to take care of a coding patient on my own than have to go get my oil changed on my own.
1927 2018-06-27 19:57:50 The battery was like $8, the oil itself was $20
1928 2018-06-27 19:57:32 Long, stressful morning. First 2 hours for an oil change at the dealership & now at the vet w a very sick fur baby. 
1929 2018-06-27 19:57:19 Picture that surface covered in crude oil and you'll understand why most #oilspillcleanup leaves 70% to 80% of the contamination untouched. MicroSorb's #archaea, on the other hand, will follow the oil down into the gravel and metabolize it until it's all gone. 
#JobForMicrobes
1930 2018-06-27 19:57:08 That’s the last time I pay to get my oil changed.... shit
1931 2018-06-27 19:57:04 They childish for that oil comment
1932 2018-06-27 19:56:52 more freedom like less womens rights, All fir Oil and Alberta,  and anti LGBTQ rights.. yeah your freedom sucks for most Canadians.
1933 2018-06-27 19:56:44 As soon as I wake up , I be like “baaae can you massage my back” ... & he grab the baby oil 
1934 2018-06-27 19:56:33 now that the Europeans no longer need USDs to buy oil, they should be exporting a lot more to China instead. RMBs not only lets them buy oil, but every kind of manufactured good imaginable. which isn't at all the case with USDs 
1935 2018-06-27 19:56:30 Are they just blemishes? Because if that’s the case I used to have really bad ones but then I started using cruelty free products/oils. the one I use now is rosehip and coconut oil.
1936 2018-06-27 19:55:50 Coconut oil is great for j/o and cooking.
1937 2018-06-27 19:55:49 My main concern was the "dumb war" in Iraq, Bush's disastrous, obviously corrupt oil misadventure.  Obama began getting us out of Iraq and then we started getting sucked back into it.
1938 2018-06-27 19:55:43 So basically @SenSanders whatever works?
1939 2018-06-27 19:55:42 sorry i cant i have to oil my bike chains
1940 2018-06-27 19:55:40 The headline is absolutely a dog whistle for “throw her in gitmo.”
1941 2018-06-27 19:55:33 So now I am also giving him a can of tuna that is in vegetable oil not the one that is packed in water and I do that about once a week to keep his system going
1942 2018-06-27 19:54:58 It’s so damn hot trying to get a oil change 
1943 2018-06-27 19:54:48 Finally getting my oil changed 
1944 2018-06-27 19:54:44 Hope the Greens won't say oil has colluded with Trump to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord treaty. Well done oil for helping Trump getting elected as the 45th #POTUS. #Oil #Trump
1945 2018-06-27 19:54:38 throw some oil on ur face and rolllllll out
1946 2018-06-27 19:54:34 Yeah there was hundreds civvies in this docu who said they hate Isis but when they came to their cities like raqqa and Mosul they had to work for them. Be it mechanic on their vehicles or work their oil fields cos they beheaded the people who said no. We would do the same
1947 2018-06-27 19:54:34 I love to use peppermint oil when I'm sick and for headaches. It also makes my place smell amazing!
1948 2018-06-27 19:54:24 Mr. Killa new song Oil It Up problematic 
1949 2018-06-27 19:54:23 I put like a teaspoon in half can of tuna. The smellier the food the better than they won't detect the olive oil. No no harm to him at all the straw was bent in half when it came out and it was surrounded by poop sorry to get graphic 
1950 2018-06-27 19:53:58 You can read the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. I think you asked me that because you think the final club that’s easiest to get into is the one where I’ll have the best chance.
1951 2018-06-27 19:53:55 wanna hurry up and get this oil change done with .
1952 2018-06-27 19:53:29 Are these things free?
1953 2018-06-27 19:53:16 @LyndaMick @seanhannity Lynda, first of all, you & Sean are freaking awesome. I could listen to you two all day. That deep NY accent, I dig it ! 

And when can Sean come to the U.S.  capital of oil drilling & production - that being the Permian Basin in Texas?!

1956 2018-06-27 19:53:01 Some people can get this oil now ,,just saying 
1957 2018-06-27 19:52:59 why does america not have pantene leave in oil sigh my curly hair doesn’t deserve this
1958 2018-06-27 19:52:51 Backwoods looking like an oil rig
1959 2018-06-27 19:52:42 I tanned w coconut oil last week and I thought I was going to fry, but it's one or the best tans I've ever had!
1960 2018-06-27 19:52:32 Do you know which study used soya oil? Leren Oslo. Do you know the results? Fewer heart attacks, fewer cardiac deaths, fewer total deaths. There's literally stronger evidence for soya oil than low carb.
1961 2018-06-27 19:52:32 @justinvb443 still doing oil and gas recruiting?
1962 2018-06-27 19:52:23 Holy Smokes! How much olive oil? I heard that olive oil itself is ok, but other things in the oil can hurt?
1963 2018-06-27 19:52:17 Good grief. Nothing bad *ever* happens, until it does. 

Security protocols are in place for a reason.
1964 2018-06-27 19:52:12 We just got in Cheerfield's Coconut Oil, perfect for making your own edibles!
1965 2018-06-27 19:52:08 Sickening excuse to buy icebreakers. You are the deplorable queen of the "Let's Pollute and Destroy the Arctic" so a few oil industry companies who lobby & support you can make $$$. I've lost respect for you, you are for $$ instead of America. Shame.
1966 2018-06-27 19:51:58 I'm around this weekend. Just let me know it's two free oil change. I have no use for it
1967 2018-06-27 19:51:51 More than troubles it’s about Iran oil
1968 2018-06-27 19:51:45 On October 17, 1953, oil began to be pumped through the pipeline.  What is the life expectancy of a pipeline?    When will it need replacing?  Who gets the revenue from the transport of the oil?  Is there a cost recovery built into the purchase?
1969 2018-06-27 19:51:36 My god katie....that is just breathtaking to look at! #yumm #legs #milf #Queen #delicious #BestLegsAllTime #oil #sexy
1970 2018-06-27 19:51:24 So I saw this at work and almost face planted into the oil of a fryer, I was laughing so hard
1971 2018-06-27 19:51:15 Have you ever noticed, right. When you lose 7-1 in 2014 and it takes four years of pearson’s brass hand oil application to remove the shit off year brass hand?
1972 2018-06-27 19:51:12 Marine demons are the most stubborn demons, we quoted scripture, called the fire on her body. She will move like snake on the floor, we challenged the demon, but not until we poured the anointing oil into her mouth which represents the "blood of Jesus" that the demon was silenced
1973 2018-06-27 19:51:07 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.
1974 2018-06-27 19:50:49 the ultimate test of fine motor skills is when u pour the sesame oil
1975 2018-06-27 19:50:49 NAZIS!!!!!! NAZIS!!!!!! NAZIS!!!!!! NAZIS!!!!! 
1976 2018-06-27 19:50:41 3. With the population explosion in MENA, a few failed states, huge numbers of displaced (far fewer children getting access to education), climate change, western interference, Saudi oil money, Israel/Palestine etc we have an ideal Petri dish for ever more hardline Islam.
1977 2018-06-27 19:50:40 How do you know it hasn't come from this state? If it wasn't for someone finding oil and gas out in different places WV wouldn't have anything going for it
1978 2018-06-27 19:50:35 @AmonJohan Good evening Johan. I have a pretty good goatee going now, and I've been using beard oil. Can't wait to see you guys live again here in wonderful Colorado!! \m/

1980 2018-06-27 19:50:12 So, tell me what is wrong when nation has 75 cents dollar, lower corp tax rate and lower interest rates, lower than USA and still can't make it work??? Ohhh that's right, can't rely only on oil and autos for exports!!!
1981 2018-06-27 19:50:11 • apply coconut oil to hair ends or scalp to prevent your hair from drying out and looking dead (after a few hours or overnight, wash out like normal)
• put your head upside down, and massage your scalp for 30 seconds every day. also do this when your washing your hair.
1982 2018-06-27 19:50:09 What about that oil company you support?will they be banned soon?or what about that oil company who own PSG?banned also???
1983 2018-06-27 19:50:08 haha thought I was clever sitting out the back smothered in carrot oil earlier for two hours didn’t I, i think I’m on the verge of sunstroke here 
1984 2018-06-27 19:49:55 Took the car in for an oil change this morning, then found out I needed to replace the front brakes. Sounds pretty  #MarsRetrograde to me.
1985 2018-06-27 19:49:51 Scientists have been projecting these changes for the past century.   Only they are actually worse than initially thought.   Let me ask you, how are scientists and socialists getting paid by acknowledging climate change, and who is paying them?   Surely not the oil industries.
1986 2018-06-27 19:49:36 Meineke- left plug for oil out, almost destroyed my engine, home depot- their stockholders  called Democrats stupid.
1987 2018-06-27 19:49:22 Pro Tip : If your pickup truck stops dripping oil on the driveway, you might need to check the oil !?! #TrumpIsAMoron
1988 2018-06-27 19:49:13 The plant-based spread is blended with sunflower oil and a pinch of salt, and then slow-churned to buttery perfection. #CountryCrockSunflower #SparkVoxBox #contest @CountryCrock
1989 2018-06-27 19:49:08 Louisiana is The Worse for oil spills...
1990 2018-06-27 19:49:08 Tea tree oil on it
1991 2018-06-27 19:49:05 今日は何オイルがいいかい?アロマオイルで香りたい?オリーブオイルでイタリアンたい?ふふふ…僕は君のためならどんなオイルにもなってやるさ…
1992 2018-06-27 19:49:01 Neymar Jnr needs to pour enough palm oil on his god in other to score against the serbians #SRBBRA
1993 2018-06-27 19:49:01 On October 17, 1953, oil began to be pumped through the pipeline.  What is the life expectancy of a pipeline?    When will it need replacing?  Who gets the revenue from the transport of the oil?  Is there a cost recovery built into the purchase?
1994 2018-06-27 19:48:44 Lmao u must need an oil change
1995 2018-06-27 19:48:42 The Oil fields of Cross Rivers State that were ceded to Akwa Ibom State initially appeared to be a problem but today, it has become a significant blessing to the state opening many great ideas to them in tourism and now Agriculture especially rice farming.
1996 2018-06-27 19:48:40 I’ve got a video coming soon using zucchini noodles. I tried to treat them as a pasta and you just can’t really do it, doesn’t grab onto a sauce well. I’ve had the best success just sautéing in oil, garlic, and red pepper flake, and treating it as a veggie/noodle hybrid.
1997 2018-06-27 19:48:28 Lamp on the tanning oil and you’ll bronze up
1998 2018-06-27 19:48:28 Great but the #31 is better.
1999 2018-06-27 19:48:23 Skating across the kitchen floor like it's an ice rink because I've just spilt oil all over the floor and have no idea how to clean it up  #allinthenameoffoodd
2000 2018-06-27 19:48:19 there......i compiled a shit ton of songs for 2 reasons.......for nostalgia and because im procrastinating a necessary oil change for my car lmao
2001 2018-06-27 19:48:17 Girlll I’m so lazy with my hair  currently I’m rocking a wash n go. I shampoo and condition and put olive oil and Lotta body moisturizer in my hair !
2002 2018-06-27 19:47:52 @SsssamanthaaMUA The @clarinsusa Comfort Lip Oil in raspberry smells like raspberry shisha and makes me feel like I should be smoking a hookah. Not the worst smell, but I feel ya
2003 2018-06-27 19:47:48 "Citrus Grandis Oil"... Ich finde den Geruch zwar klasse, aber wenn Zitrus nicht geht, wirds wohl nix sein. Vielleicht lässt Dich die Apotheke Deines Vertrauens aber mal schnüffeln.
2004 2018-06-27 19:47:48 Same with me too. I remember coating myself in factor 2 oil and lying in it! I'm in my forties and it just kills me. I'm fine in winter though 
2005 2018-06-27 19:47:47 Oil & gas is almost certainly following Hotelling’s Law. 

We are in for a big crash again when the Fed finishes its hiking cycle.
2006 2018-06-27 19:47:40 This party is making us hungry, so let’s move the discussion to the kitchen. Mmmm, @CountryCrock Sunflower Oil Buttery Spread tastes just like butter! #CountryCrockSunflower #SparkVoxBox #contest
2007 2018-06-27 19:47:10 Oil looks slow
2008 2018-06-27 19:47:10 Passando bio oil e colageno no corpo todo pra ver se aguenta bontinho coca cola e doce até os 40 anos
2009 2018-06-27 19:47:04 Chef McElroy cut up some rotten zucchini, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with hot sauce.
2010 2018-06-27 19:46:48 I knew my bf was gonna be my bf when I was putting peppermint oil on my head to get rid of my headache & and he wanted to try some & It got in his eye and he yelled IT FEELS LIKE THERE’S BUBBLE GUM IN MY EYE & I laughed way harder than I should’ve
2011 2018-06-27 19:46:46 Cuba is communist. Castro admitted as much. Venezuela seized the means of production on oil and set market prices. That's not what @OfficialSPGB is proposing. They're proposing a fantasy land where greed and power dont exist. If you're going to refute SPGB at least do it honestly
2012 2018-06-27 19:46:46 Called my dad to ask him what kind of oil filter he preferred me to use and he said “Idk I don’t work on dodges and u don’t live with me anymore so I don’t have to know these things” like love u 2 dad 
2013 2018-06-27 19:46:06 Indeed. Nazis are in control. Concentration camps n all.
2014 2018-06-27 19:46:05 I hear that Ethiopia will start extracting oil from the Ogaden what does the Federal Government of Somalia think about this.
2015 2018-06-27 19:46:04 Delusional? Perhaps.

I think it's more like optimism.

#HelicopterRides
2016 2018-06-27 19:45:58 Hold on...you think civilization is better off with fossil fuels? Uh...no, how many people have been killed in wars due to fights over oil? Both Iraq wars were about oil. 300000 civilians dead. 1000s of soldiers dead for oil, not any other reason. Energy is not limited to oil.
2017 2018-06-27 19:45:52 Why do you use innocent animals? Why don’t you use oxygen thieves like Jon Venables, Robert Thompson, Roy Whiting, Ian Huntly etc? Fuckin disgusting. 

The cure for cancer is cannabis oil anyway
2018 2018-06-27 19:45:41 Also, divesting from Big Banks helps. They use your money to fund Big Oil & Corporations. Divest & go w/local banks or credit unions. Cut back on petro also. Carpool, public transportation, walk, bike anything to not feed Big Oil.
2019 2018-06-27 19:45:39 Ten lines from #SciFi B Movies we deserve to hear.

6/10 “Our only chance to beat the robots now is to drink all the machine oil.”
2020 2018-06-27 19:45:33 It’s mad how naive most people clearly are about how this group has operated. Isis is all about oil.. They were earning a million dollars a week from it in 2014. All being bought from tankers coming from mainland Turkey. And that Turkey has zero border controls stopping people
2021 2018-06-27 19:45:26 I only made a small portion for my soup, likely under 10 minutes first try. Mixed the dough dry (strong flour, pinch of baking powder, some water, oil), flattened and cut fine strips with a knife, tossed into soup.
Dough has to "sit" for some variants I guess but whatever.
2022 2018-06-27 19:45:20 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

2026 2018-06-27 19:44:37 Castor oil is the HOLY GRAIL for hair growth and thickness of hair. Like my hair is getting thicker & thicker. 
2027 2018-06-27 19:44:33 Anything with oil is running today and overnight. Sheesh.
2028 2018-06-27 19:44:32 Ew palm oil is vile
2029 2018-06-27 19:44:15 What did this false flag promote?  School shootings promote gun control.  9/11 - wars and oil.  Do you have a theory?
2030 2018-06-27 19:44:15 Follow the OIL!
2031 2018-06-27 19:44:14 Watch it be an American who did law work for a Russian gov entity, like oil or banks. Be afraid.
2032 2018-06-27 19:44:05 Meet with a group of friends at an inn. Bring lots of rope, oil, 10' poles etc. Set off on a quest to save the realm from the evil villain.
2033 2018-06-27 19:44:04 To me, it links to an issue of generation in need of instant gratification.

Move 100miles an hour but forget to check your oil/gas levels/tire tread, to busy focusing on "becoming the next big thing". 

Or laziness, "i'll do it tomorrow".
2034 2018-06-27 19:44:03 tretinoin cream, aloe vera, coconut oil, tea tree oil, witch hazel, and rose water help to fade acne scars

2038 2018-06-27 19:43:52 I was @ the dealership waiting on an oil change and there were three separate waiting areas with different tv, so these 3 people all come and sit in the same row as me 
2039 2018-06-27 19:43:47 @The_Friction  quick question! what are your personal favorite oil cleansers?
2040 2018-06-27 19:43:43 $CEI man I am pray to the oil god... let us see $1 or $2+ this week... keep us oil up and alive !!!
2041 2018-06-27 19:43:39 OMG HELL YES
2042 2018-06-27 19:43:38 I dont agree with any socialist party, but the socialist govt of Ven owns the means of production of their only econ strength, oil where as this political movement wants workers to own the means of production. By comparing them to Ven, you just sound ignorant.
2043 2018-06-27 19:43:30 WEDNESDAY OIL UPDATE.....
US oil exports boom to record level, surpassing most OPEC nations

U.S. oil production is booming at record levels, and U.S. oil exports have also reached new highs — 3 million barrels a day in the last week, according to government data.
2044 2018-06-27 19:43:26 My Afro is behaving like a disciplined child 
Coming along so well with the treats of Avocado, Olive oil, Coconut Oil and Apple Cider Vinegar. 

#blackgirlmagic 
2045 2018-06-27 19:43:22 I thought I needed to run and find somebody to love
But all I needed was some coconut oil
Don't worry'bout the small things
I know I can do all things
Mama always told me it would be alright
2046 2018-06-27 19:43:10 Are these slip resistant? Like oil in the shop?
2047 2018-06-27 19:42:55 Awesome, gonna try my hand at making some ghee today!  I tend to use avocado oil since it's very high smoke point.  Any reason to prefer canola?
2048 2018-06-27 19:42:52 Don’t sleep on the rose oil from Pixi
2049 2018-06-27 19:42:44 @RepMaxineWaters could give her pointers.
Go to a few Antifa meetings and mobilize the brick and bat crowd? Dog every Republican day and night? #vivalarevolution 
2050 2018-06-27 19:42:40 That’s been my go to homemade recently. Oil, balsamic vinegar, salt pepper lemon and honey. Wisk wisk and it’s perfect
2051 2018-06-27 19:42:40 People probably equate independence to 3 for the most part. Though I’d bet one of the benefits envisioned is both 1 and 2
Also,once sufficient production exists we’re closer to 3 but given the global nature of oil markets it doesn’t make sense to invest specifically for that goal
2052 2018-06-27 19:42:35 New tires and an oil change for the car. rip my wallet, but yay for no more scary tire
2053 2018-06-27 19:42:34 Gets payed Friday. Spends paycheck on oil change, vacuum, kitchen table. #adulting

2060 2018-06-27 19:41:21 Let GoK drill and transport oil from West Pokot. Turkana si Kenya!
2061 2018-06-27 19:41:17 $TGC no follow through. Will revisit if oil continues showing momentum
2062 2018-06-27 19:41:10 I’m in oil. Those closest to the flow of oil are fine. The few cuts there were, were HR, engineering, secretary as skills are interchangeable. The “blue collar” jobs have remained steady.
2063 2018-06-27 19:41:07 Lmaoo a whole you. Where the oil money dey go this babe?
2064 2018-06-27 19:40:55 All I needed was some coconut oil 
2065 2018-06-27 19:40:47 Every dead Isis members passport shows the last stamp is from crossing from Turkey. Captured fighters say how easy it is to cross from Turkey to join the group. All the oil and fuel that is sold to Turkey and they pay not just in money but in weapons and gear. It’s quite obvious
2066 2018-06-27 19:40:46 Charley 
It's like the oil was from China

2069 2018-06-27 19:40:12 im coming over! I got fries in the freezer whats upppp  you got the oil niggggaaaaa *in our high pitch voice*
2070 2018-06-27 19:40:10 The industry knows, sure. But there seems to be quite a bit of ignorance on display by the general public when they try to lay the blame for the oil sector crash on the Liberals. Oil is volatile, and producing provinces subsidize heavily to encourage investment.
2071 2018-06-27 19:40:07 サラダ油って体に悪いんですか？サラダなのに？
2072 2018-06-27 19:40:05 Still, expect crude oil will fall below $70

2078 2018-06-27 19:39:33 Lmao... I will peel off ur skin and make you watch the video before tossing you into boiling oil 
2079 2018-06-27 19:39:29 Thank you to Ray Dunaway and WTIC 1080 for having us on their show today to talk about the new heating oil and #bioheat
2080 2018-06-27 19:39:24 Good time to short #OIL 
2081 2018-06-27 19:39:11 What will happen to our "incredible waters and pristine beaches" if you succeed in your plan to hand Florida over to Big Oil?
2082 2018-06-27 19:39:05 Tell my dad to stop cooking with peanut oil cause my sister is allergic so he switches to coconut. Why is everyone in my fucking family an idiot??
2083 2018-06-27 19:38:58 When the government owns the means of production, they are effectively managing businesses. 

And the socialist Venezuelan government does a terrible job of this. 

Since September 2017, oil prices have been rising. How much has the Venezuelan economy improved?
2084 2018-06-27 19:38:52 When are people going to realize US is almost a net oil exporter at this point? We’re probably at the point where oil supports dollar and more so going forward. Of course the old algos don’t work, net oil imports down 85%.
2085 2018-06-27 19:38:51 Yeah, so many US citizens get such a large amount of US oil revenues?
2086 2018-06-27 19:38:49 WD40 is the only real essential oil.
2087 2018-06-27 19:38:17 If you’re in oil you should try some Houston staffing companies they should be able to find you something
2088 2018-06-27 19:38:01 I just thought of it but like remember back in nct life Mark tried to cook an egg but forgot to put the oil and the egg sorta separated already but then mark just put the oil,,, on top of it
2089 2018-06-27 19:37:44 so you want to keep giving westminster 92% of it.
WM has over 50 years near bankrupted an oil rich UK,,and you want scots to stay with such incompetence?
2090 2018-06-27 19:37:30 And your grandchildren's right to kill off great grandchildren.
2091 2018-06-27 19:37:24 Try coconut oil and a shower cap and a beanie. 
Put a generous amount of coconut oil onto your hair, put the shower cap on and then beanie then sleep with it on. Wash it out in the morning.
2092 2018-06-27 19:37:19 My heart goes out to you. In Jan I knocked over a glass ramekin with olive oil in. It splattered everywhere. Mostly on my brand new light grey Emu suede boots. I felt it was my punishment for indulging in such a thing.
2093 2018-06-27 19:37:18 You know I haven’t tried in awhile since I chopped so much hair off but I bet I could get a little nub  I just like it up because my hair is so fine that even touching it to push it out of the way creates an oil slick
2094 2018-06-27 19:37:17 Went to get an oil change and a tire patched, leaving with an oil change, four new tires, and the need for brakes and rotors. Hello, more debt.
2095 2018-06-27 19:37:06 Who's selling it off to the oil companies and mining cos.

2098 2018-06-27 19:36:47 Iya, karena micellar water itu bukan first cleanser dan ga seampuh cleansing oil buat ngangkat meap
2099 2018-06-27 19:36:31 Oil has nothing to do with it,,scots economy is strong enough to regard oil as a bonus.
The EU did not lie to scots or ignore their votes did they,westminster did that.
In EU scots have a voice,a vote and a veto,,in UK we have no say on anything
2100 2018-06-27 19:36:27 That and..... fasting, protein under 40g a day, fat, macros, ketones, pee sticks, coconut oil, cooking everthing in butter....it's got way out of hand
2101 2018-06-27 19:36:20 According to what? Because of the dogma created by our medical and pharmaceutical industries which has been hijacked by big oil corporations since 1901? The ingredients in vaccines have consistently been proven to cause undesirable affects.
2102 2018-06-27 19:35:43 It was over before it started. Not even a parking ticket in 2 years.
2103 2018-06-27 19:35:38 ...just a few weeks ago?? OPEC started to drill again. Why?? America started to drill more. OPEC controls the cost of barrel of oil but not the flow of oil.

Same with tariffs. Trudeau EVEN SAID he is protecting his farmers up north with the tariffs on beef.

Nice try, Darryl.
2104 2018-06-27 19:35:30 justice kennedy own back. there if u h8 to he. the all oil teaching you left.
2105 2018-06-27 19:35:30 The statement of the four countries did not involve (contrary to the past) Spain with great interests through the company Resbol and did not involve Austria with interests in the oil crescent...
2106 2018-06-27 19:35:22 Do everything you can @POTUS, to allow the Eagle Ford Shale, in Texas, to increase Production of oil/Nat. Gas.  Our oil is "sweet", Texas needs those jobs, get our Refineries going full capacity. #MAGA

2107 2018-06-27 19:35:16 @IvyLeagueLlama i think it was like 2011 and everyday it was oil is up market is down oil is down market is up

2109 2018-06-27 19:35:06 need to get up & get my baby stuff for his birthday and a oil change.
2110 2018-06-27 19:35:01 GONNA NEED WELFARE HEALTHCARE, A HEALTHFUL DOSE OF UPTAKE INHIBITORS AND FRAKAPHOBIA MEDS AFTER YOU LEARN OIL & GAS RECOVERY RECOVERS PRECIOUS WATER RESOURCES FROM THE UNDERWORLD
2111 2018-06-27 19:34:58 I get your point and can somewhat agree with you. As for the oil, that's the Bush family. I agree about Iraq, and Ghadaffi too. Sending our soldiers to fight on foreign soil under false pretenses really upsets me. I'm just not sure Venezuela is about oil, maybe instability.
2112 2018-06-27 19:34:45 The industry knows prices cycle and are in for the long game. Oil has rebounded to over $70 a barrel and demand is still rising. Only thing holding them back is poor govt policy and hostility to the sector. Small but vocal opposition to all fossil fuel projects by hypocrites.
2113 2018-06-27 19:34:43 Hey! Iit was ok but guess what? It was too dry! @Tonystone61 was right I add a bit of oil but not much and turkey mince soaked up all the sauce. It was ok but I Won’t do it again.
2114 2018-06-27 19:34:39 Ahh what a beautiful way to come home. I cleaned the house before I left to run errands, put my essential oil warmer on and lit an incense.  this is why I like things done a certain way
2115 2018-06-27 19:34:30 Shows you dont know much about American history or history of jurisprudence if you stand by your statements
2116 2018-06-27 19:34:25 Y’all. I’ve been using the @SolanaLuxe Fairy Garden Oil for a few days now and MY FACE HAS NEVER BEEN SO SOFT. S H O O K. If you wanna save a lil something and get some products from this lovely business, use code “Cheyanne10”. ..... Brb touching my GLOWING face some more

2120 2018-06-27 19:33:58 It DOES contain peanut ingredients... Nice to see a response from Whole Foods, though. I get the one from Trader Joe’s. It has one ingredient, and it’s not palm oil.
2121 2018-06-27 19:33:38 The very ironic thing is that the previous and recent fighting has been between the so called 'army' and the 'oil installation guards' ,,, quite indicative of how destructive the activities of those militias are.
2122 2018-06-27 19:33:20 Two questions for you Mark
1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil and gas revenues or the 8% we get now?
2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run their own country?
2123 2018-06-27 19:33:14 The laundress would like a word, sir. Olive oil, as youmust remember, is deucedly difficult to remove from your sequined undergarments.
2124 2018-06-27 19:33:03 But you would without doubt praise the CPIB to the heavens if they investing a few billion in a certain pipeline to increase oil output in the sands. This would be vital nation building as opposed to the silly concern about existential climate change.
2125 2018-06-27 19:32:58 If corn oil is made from corn, and vegetable oil is made from vegetables, is there something we need to know about baby oil?
2126 2018-06-27 19:32:31 so proud of my girl @Zoella for everything she's accomplished. i need to get her lip oil and mist! both sold out at ulta though. when will it be restocked? @ZoellaBeauty

2130 2018-06-27 19:31:31 I’d say keep it dry, except for a bit of oil or butter, then bake it. I just do a basic crumble then bung a load of extra bits in. Oats have such a good texture and flavour when baked and make a crumble more interesting :)
2131 2018-06-27 19:31:27 Ma Germans ninshi oil ina sila for the machine's ?
Welcome to the world cup 2018
2132 2018-06-27 19:31:24 ... tariffs do. It makes an uneven playing field.

Remember, if you can, before fracking (oil drilling). Democrats themselves were putting "tariffs" on American's by not drilling. OPEC controlled oil cost. Controlled the oil. Less drilling, less output by OPEC.

What happened....
2133 2018-06-27 19:31:20 I should try that! The problem my face is great when it just has moisturizer on but the minute make up hits it dries up!  but definitely will try the oil, thanks boo!
2134 2018-06-27 19:31:17 I’m making tacos today the meat is already done... boneless chicken thighs marinated in lime juice, cumin, garlic, onion, black pepper, red pepper seasoning, and olive oil... I really shouldn’t eat flour tortillas but I can’t just cut bread now I’m doing everything slow.
2135 2018-06-27 19:31:14 Helium is a finite resource. The Balloon fragments are not "re-entering the atmosphere have little mass so won't and don't 'burn up'...your thinking of space debris.We can't replace helium or recover it , it is a finite resource it will run out , like Oil.
2136 2018-06-27 19:31:05 What? No baby oil?
2137 2018-06-27 19:30:55 Lip oil makes me feel like a brand new bitch.
2138 2018-06-27 19:30:54 There’s a mom where I’m getting an oil change and he little girl is in the bathroom yelling.. the mom said, “she loves public restrooms and how they echo”  I hope emery is like her.
2139 2018-06-27 19:30:37 the atom of a shop becomes an unformed hydrofoil
the oil of a night becomes an ungroomed airfoil
2140 2018-06-27 19:30:35 So what I interpret is you and that so-called President @realDonaldTrump are pleading with Venezuela and OPEC to lower oil production in order for the U.S. to remain competitive globally. I know damn well you don’t care about the citizens of Venezuela!
2141 2018-06-27 19:30:20 definitely check it out. Mix the clay with some olive oil and voila...it opens up your cuticles for better definition. It really is like magic.

2157 2018-06-27 19:28:33 Is being an exporter "independence"? We're still going to be importing a significant portion of our consumable oil regardless of the infrastructure increase aren't we?

2162 2018-06-27 19:28:08 In China in   1927 I helped see to it that  Standard Oil went  on its way unmolested.   Looking back on it, I might  have  given Al  Capone a few hints. The best   he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.”

2181 2018-06-27 19:25:49 We weren't going to get them with Hillary either, that's my point. More medical bankruptcies, more people literally dying from lack of adequate health care, more oil pipeline leaks and drilling in places we have no business drilling, more homeless single mothers, MORE poverty

2189 2018-06-27 19:24:52 Not sure exactly. I always go to the dealership so I guess that's why. I've been told to go to oil-change-specific places before but I'm weird about switching I guess lol

2196 2018-06-27 19:24:03 It's funny how this "rational fear" never comes up from the right when it comes to tax breaks, buying 10 trillion dollar pipelines, subsidising profitable oil and gas corporations, buying military equipment. It is exclusively deployed wrt programs that help "undeserving" people.
2197 2018-06-27 19:24:00 I lived through that time - I was young - but being part of the EEC wasn't even visible - too much to deal with on the oil/coal front.

I think our membership of the EEC acted as a stabilizer if anything.

2208 2018-06-27 19:22:49 for skin care...i can never bring myself to do all the things i used to do but coconut oil has been a lifesaver.
it can be a bit pricey but it'll last forever and you can leave it on your face for as long as you need. it moistuizes and kills bacteria which has helped me
2209 2018-06-27 19:22:47 But in reality there is no such thing as responsibly sourced palm oil. You need to change your ingredient formulations instead. Surely that's a better target to have for end of 2020?

2246 2018-06-27 19:17:50 In case anyone is considering it, I've found that CBD oil really is helpful for anxiety. It won't poof away your anxious thoughts but it does significantly temper your bodily reactions to those thoughts, preventing you from spiraling out of control
2247 2018-06-27 19:17:43 $XLU $XLE $XOP strong, dollar too

Oil must be really expensive across the pond...
2248 2018-06-27 19:17:33 Govt policy on coal & oil is still producing far too much . . . #ClimateChange 
2249 2018-06-27 19:17:29 Shoot I got off work and home about 12am and first thing I did was grab the testament and read. Sometimes just a chapter.. but I read allot. Especially when waiting ... Dr or oil change. Etc. I am excited for the next one to be released by @ILLUMINATIAM
2250 2018-06-27 19:17:19 Secret sauce ... olive oil, chopped garlic, paprika powder, pepper.
2251 2018-06-27 19:17:07 Oil coming back down soon to catch up IMO, look at #USO or #WTI chart, consider seasonality as well.

2256 2018-06-27 19:16:38 That’s because Venezuela refuses to hand over their oil and bank. Same with Iran. Same reason they did ghadaffi like that. Same reason we attacked Iraq.
2257 2018-06-27 19:16:34 #fucktrump So maybe you are so HAPPY with oil inventories dates this week, 9,9 M down, congratulations.
2258 2018-06-27 19:16:31 Oil market currently focused all on OPEC and supply. But there is something called demand.

2279 2018-06-27 19:14:03 Then when it's cooked, all the oil comes on top. Don't be deceived
2280 2018-06-27 19:13:57 Try the All nighter. It’s oil free and it’s good for both oily and dry skin!
2281 2018-06-27 19:13:54 Hitting a wall with midstream delivery capabilities that threatens to thin inventory even under lower than expected consumption. Recipe for continued bullish oil
2282 2018-06-27 19:13:52 @realDonaldTrump I forgot to mention that Iran's sanctions on oil should not be reduced, but should be cut off. It is vital for us to repeat it all the time. This is our last request for you, and leave the rest of the affairs to the Iranian people to complete the work. Good luck

2286 2018-06-27 19:13:39 an olive oil is a farther down enamel laugh fallen in line than its sponsor
2287 2018-06-27 19:13:32 Did anyone else have to read that one book about how oil dumping negatively affects the environment? And they had a crab race at one point? That’s what I thought of. It might not be a part of the school curriculum outside of Maryland...
2288 2018-06-27 19:13:27 I’m gonna go out in a limb here and say your oil filter is somewhere under your hood
2289 2018-06-27 19:13:22 Yes,but from what I understood, there are too many dairy farmers, they make too much milk, so they have to lower their prices to sell it, too much competition. They should do what they do with oil, stop letting farmers pump to much milk, that would help the prices and profits.

2293 2018-06-27 19:12:50 @realDonaldTrump 
International oil prices wti Crude oil rattles speculators, so the world economy is ruining due to the surge in oil prices.
As the economy is plummeting, we must take strong steps to reduce oil prices to less than $ 50 per barrel.
2294 2018-06-27 19:12:47 Fortunately, I observed the mistake and had them drain, and replace the oil before the car was started 
2295 2018-06-27 19:12:47 My hair smells like patchouli and cypress oil. It’s so earthy I can’t stop smelling it.

2300 2018-06-27 19:12:22 It's not about climate silly. Just like whale oil industry. Read about it. People didn't stop hunting whales because it was cruel.  It was about cost. Renewable energy is cheaper/free.
2301 2018-06-27 19:12:16 Abeggi. Dont let him scare you please. If you add too much oil this time, use less the next lol. Practice = Perfect.
2302 2018-06-27 19:12:14 I only saw the ‘good’ when I spoke of the love. I’m with you on the animal cruelty.  I had an unforgettable childhood experience of a neighbor drowning a litter of kittens and burning them in an oil drum. I only saw the smoke afterwards and was horrified to learn what he’d done.

2305 2018-06-27 19:12:04 Oil is a global trade vessel based on refining capabilities. Energy "independence" conceptually makes zero sense unless we're going to dump another trillion or so into refining and mid-stream transport capabilities.
2306 2018-06-27 19:11:46 Cheers mate, I like me cooking, not that this really is, it’s a just chop it up glug of oil an in the oven. The main thing are the sausages, they are top notch from @Vfsausages you really won’t find better in my most humble..and it smells delicious!!

2331 2018-06-27 19:09:50 @CatherineBizTV Catherine we've seen oil rise $4 a barrel why is Canadian dollar dropping?
Your thoughts...
2332 2018-06-27 19:09:38 Look at the Iraqi oil for example. It is cleared ahead of arrival into US because the importing refinery is responsible for it. Then look at Saudi oil. It is ARAMCO that decides because it’s their vessels.
2333 2018-06-27 19:09:38 Wise Elephant!!! Leader of our herd. Slayer of the scoundrels. Humper of the fully exposed bull. Gladiator of Oil-ville. Veteran of the oil war of 2008.

2337 2018-06-27 19:09:02 Replacement due? Or just an oil change?

2380 2018-06-27 19:03:33 @CNBCnow If crude oil futures continue to go higher along with gasoline prices
such online stores such as Amazon will suffer dearly as people will use their money

You can prevent the surge.

2399 2018-06-27 19:01:38 Oh C'mon Charles, you are folding as fast as Harley Davidson. Cut off oil, power, and go after intellectual property. Done deal.
2400 2018-06-27 19:01:35 From doing crooked taxes, to slanging oil, to working LA county. We made it!
2401 2018-06-27 19:01:33 The normal chow is relatively high in corn and in soybean oil (corn is the second highest listed ingredient). Not so much the high-fat chow. Both are obviously pretty highly processed fare.
2402 2018-06-27 19:01:16 The oil companies solve the problem they have caused for decades is ridiculous. They can take a sit on a glacier
2403 2018-06-27 19:01:10 Investing. In uranium but not bullish until some GREAT fundamentals come to fruition. Commodities can run as cycle ends - see oil.
2404 2018-06-27 19:01:02 Vediamo: Svizzera giusto 2/3 farmaci, Norvegia esportano tutto il petrolio che producono, per loro basta l’idroelettrico, Canada shale oil € gas & sabbie bituminose, Israele... lista infinita 
Scusa sono a cena, se hai altre idee... tanto lo so che vuoi dire colpa dell’Euro no?
2405 2018-06-27 19:00:36 The GNA already had access to oil revenues to I can’t fathom why they would want to attack it - also if you’re taking about previous awareness of the attack - the LNA were taking about it for weeks.

So the question is why didn’t LNA better prepare to repel it?
2406 2018-06-27 19:00:30 Ugh getting an oil change
2407 2018-06-27 19:00:27 You're going to oil up and....?

2409 2018-06-27 19:00:13 That then led to the OAPEC oil embargo which last from 10/73 to 03/74 and then the UK coal miners decided to take their opportunity to play their joker and went on strike in 02/74. So the UK was caught in the pincer of international geo-politics… 
2410 2018-06-27 19:00:07 Can't wait for 5 years for now when a democratic nation invades us to bring us democracy and freedom and take our oil.

2419 2018-06-27 18:58:58 Got my brother an essential oil diffuser for his car, he couldn’t be more happy with it .
2420 2018-06-27 18:58:57 These are all long term contract buys so price is not quotes day to day. Even after transportation costs it competitive to Gulf Crude as there is no Asian Premium. GoI has allowed state owned oil firms to use foreign vessels & also VLCCs into Indian ports.
2421 2018-06-27 18:58:44 another chance for me to oil and base my own scalp.
2422 2018-06-27 18:58:30 Have you actually got an argument or are you just a Nat with no understanding of reality like Salmond when he staked his argument on $115 oil.

2427 2018-06-27 18:57:51 CBD oil helped my mom-in-law. She accidentally quit her antidepressants cold turkey a month or so ago while she had built up CBD in her system. Withdrawals sucked, but she says she feels fine now.

2432 2018-06-27 18:57:14 Olive oil?
2433 2018-06-27 18:57:06 yep. 

ppl questioning renewables think this is a slow energy transition, like coal to oil to  gas. but it's not. it is a technology curve... 

(besides, even without #SiteC, BC already has huge 'batteries' (reservoirs) than can level out additions of wind and solar...)

2438 2018-06-27 18:56:40 I think the point is most people like yourself see oil as a zero sum game, that was not my point. The zero-sum game usually comes from a philosophical prospective (mainly a collectivist one) we can only have one or the other. I don't see that as true, a true free market provides.

2457 2018-06-27 18:54:19 I'm short too, but I think we might see 73.xx again. Maybe even closely above 73 on a daily basis. As I said before, WTI went the *wrong* way in May to close above 72 before dropping $10.

2460 2018-06-27 18:53:48 @realDonaldTrump The surge in international oil prices wti crude oil prices
As speculators have intervened, it is necessary to increase shale gas in order to prevent the skyrocketing of international oil prices, and to increase the volume of oil in Russia and the Middle East.

2502 2018-06-27 18:48:32 Thats a bit false logic to the point I was making, the majority of oil is use for power WAS my point.
The oil cartels have a tight grip on that for a reason, thats very anti-Liberty.
2503 2018-06-27 18:48:11 My cheeks are going through the most this winter with dry patches. So I made a plan. Mixed my epizone cream with some castor oil and a dash of baby oil to help kill the bad castor oil smell

2519 2018-06-27 18:45:43 Research group V2 has opened a new way of producing coconut oil. The substance that generates the oil is called a "white hole" by analogy with a black hole, since the principles of their work are similar. 4marvel is a technology that creates a "white hole" substance #discoveries
2520 2018-06-27 18:45:39 Oil rallying really hard, WTI just below this year's highs in USD terms, but already surpassing them in EUR, GBP or CNY terms. So strong!
2521 2018-06-27 18:45:38 Thoughtful isn’t normally a term that comes to mind when one thinks of Trump. You’re a sycophant now, sold your country out to a snake oil salesman.
2522 2018-06-27 18:45:34 I am well aware of that. I said that because you mentioned those three or four countries that you said all have oil, that's why bush went toIraq in the first place
2523 2018-06-27 18:45:23 I just talked my nana into buying CBD oil for her fibromyalgia. She is so excited about it!
2524 2018-06-27 18:45:16 ...or they don’t care and rely on their own reserves. We have had years in which the US was an oil exporter.
2525 2018-06-27 18:45:14 He should, then retract
2526 2018-06-27 18:45:12 If you strongly dislike the taste of coconut and somebody tells you that using coconut oil while cooking won’t leave a coconut taste to your food...Do NOT believe them! They are lying to you and never speak to them again
2527 2018-06-27 18:45:04 And we should be glad that Rockefeller saved the whales by making oil lamp widely available and affordable
And now a few less whales has couch sloth socialists in a frenzy
Get over it
2528 2018-06-27 18:45:04 Maybe he needs a little more oil?
2529 2018-06-27 18:44:56 And on that note, we should bear in mind, the Rs would be happy to lock us all up but for the fact they're too cheap to feed us, and need us for all those new mines and oil rigs planned for our gorgeous, virgin national lands and waters. Way past time to PULL THE EMERGENCY CORD.
2530 2018-06-27 18:44:45 a cap of olive oil and a table spoon of washing up liquid!! works wonders
2531 2018-06-27 18:44:27 You’ve been brainwashed well by politicians who campaigns are funded by big oil gas and coal to lie to the public about global warming.  No I just use what I believe are the facts.
2532 2018-06-27 18:44:20 Cause of your meltdown few weeks ago re Wilshire leaving. Would rather have oil than jack
2533 2018-06-27 18:44:17 Our Gary’s obviously been taking advantage of the relaxed cannabis oil laws!! Guy’s a right warmer....

2538 2018-06-27 18:43:37 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
2539 2018-06-27 18:43:36 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
2540 2018-06-27 18:43:20 Rosehip oil is the holy grail of oils!!! I’m using a mixture by cocoa butter has like three different oils it’s pretty thin so I make it a serum after toner. Aloes are pretty easy to take care. If you want them fat and big then fertilizers and all.
2541 2018-06-27 18:43:15 Progressive diversity doesn't care about the number of women working on the oil rig, they care about how many women are in management at the oil rig company.

Alternatively, May Contain: Milk
2545 2018-06-27 18:43:03 Wings, beer, and maybe the lobster/shrimp mac n cheese. IMO: Wagyu (is it legit?), they are insulting Carl with truffle on the menu (unless the Fox needs an oil change), the Smoked Cuban will fail your expectations because it isn't West NY. I listened to Ep.8 of the podcast 2x.
2546 2018-06-27 18:42:59 My question is where was Africom's statement when Chadian Rebels, Jadhran and Co were attacking the oil terminals? Or are they considered a legitimate entity?
2547 2018-06-27 18:42:55 "The End of Oil should come after the End Of The World"
2548 2018-06-27 18:42:47 well...not really. GEJ is still more terrible than Buhari because GEJ enjoyed high crude oil prices and the after effects of Obj's awesome administration. 

Buhari doesn't control oil prices and neither does GEJ to be fair so let's just leave it at that...

Mix all together!
2554 2018-06-27 18:41:57 Omg that sounds WAY more lovely than arse oil lol
2555 2018-06-27 18:41:57 Met an old mechanic. At 17 (in 1960), started sweeping/cleaning local garage at 50 cents an hour. Three months later, learned to do oil changes & tire rotations - $2 an hour. A year later, making same as mechanics. Now, owns 3 shops. Minimum wage would have prevented all of this.
2556 2018-06-27 18:41:50 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
2557 2018-06-27 18:41:50 2AM realizations: I need a lifetime supply of lavender essential oil to help me sleep and survive adulthood 
2558 2018-06-27 18:41:47 First, why do you need to call me an idiot.  Obviously we have a difference of opinion.   There are many options, including reprioritizing how we spend our money as a country.  Do we need to subsidize big oil and perpetually increase the inflated military budget?
2559 2018-06-27 18:41:39 Gorgeous!

PS  How many Danish do you have to put in the press to get that much oil?
2560 2018-06-27 18:41:37 Yesssss!! I've been using serums with hyaluronic acid and this rosehip seed oil honestly my skin is THANKING ME. Really wanted to keep an aloe vera plant but I can barely keep myself together what more a plant so I'll just nvm.
2561 2018-06-27 18:41:27 Not in the least sense!  Now a question for you.  Is there clothing involved and if not oil?

2563 2018-06-27 18:41:20 Republicans always deliver to their base. Bush gave his base $150 a barrel oil, Trump the tax cut and supreme court. For them Trump will go down as one of their greatest leaders. For us, not so much, for it always is our weath being transferred away.

2580 2018-06-27 18:39:39 I just joined the elite group of people that can say they fell asleep in the waiting room of an oil change place.

2582 2018-06-27 18:39:15 It's a busy news day but: WTI crude (aka the US oil price) just hit its highest level since November 2014 after a report suggesting US stockpiles declined more than expected. Makes Trump's efforts at pinning blame on high oil prices on OPEC that much more difficult.

IN tombs of gold and lapis lazuli 
Bodies of holy men and women exude 
Miraculous oil, odour of violet. 
But under heavy loads of trampled clay 
Lie bodies of the vampires full of blood; 
Their shrouds are bloody and their lips are wet.

2662 2018-06-27 18:31:29 How can you trust a guy whose name is two last names?
[Further, regarding potential Dem candidates in 2020: how can you support a guy (Deval Patrick) whose last name is his first and his first name his last?]
2663 2018-06-27 18:31:17 I need a oil change, breaks, tire rotation, and a front end alignment 
2664 2018-06-27 18:31:11 Simple answer of course is many people didn’t. Ask @Harryslaststand. Post WW2 There was huge public investment. 1973 Oil Embargo imposed by OPEC was the start of an economic contraction which showed how vulnerable we were to external economic shocks. Luckily we had a way out. #EU
2665 2018-06-27 18:30:53 Got a free car wash with my oil change ooo yea

2669 2018-06-27 18:30:27 Facts. Palm oil is one of the most environmentally damaging things to exist. It sucks.
2670 2018-06-27 18:30:23 why did you put coconut oil in your hair?

2672 2018-06-27 18:29:57 US Oil Inventories should plunge more next week, as oil sand power outages really affect supply figures.  Think $USO and $XLE stocks stay strong for another week.  $EMES $HCLP
2673 2018-06-27 18:29:54 Is it now? Because I remember pancake mix having you add oil, eggs, and milk, but using water is probs more vegan-friendly now
2674 2018-06-27 18:29:24 @LadyJaneGrey3 congrats on the new company. Here’s to happy miles & oil changes!
2675 2018-06-27 18:29:21 I washed my hair w conditioner (wasn’t dirty as I had recently washed two days ago) massaged my hair with hair food, some castor oil and MPL oil. But rn I’m so close to cutting my hair cos my scalp is so itchy help #GirlTalkZA
2676 2018-06-27 18:29:20 @acmilan you seriously have to.Corrupt @ChampionsLeague  couldn't do anything about PSG for breaking FFP regulation year after year because of special interest and oil money from fraud state QATAR.
2677 2018-06-27 18:28:57 Dammit, I told the wife her little vid of me after I took a really good dump would be on the internet eventually.
2678 2018-06-27 18:28:47 @zannavandijk you’re into pumpkin seeds right? Have you ever tried pumpkin seed oil as a dressing?
2679 2018-06-27 18:28:38 SO YOU WANT FOODS OR OIL TRUCKS, HOOMAN :-)
2680 2018-06-27 18:28:35 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!
2681 2018-06-27 18:28:35 Not only a hypocrite but desperate attempt to stay relevant. I was never a huge fan she seems very fake. As a Christian myself and attacking a fellow believer shows her insincere fans how truly fake she is and trying to win over a group. I never bought into her snake oil.

2683 2018-06-27 18:28:29 So what's the deal with the blue wave? I think it's more like a oil slick.
2684 2018-06-27 18:28:25 People who use coconut oil on their face can’t be trusted
2685 2018-06-27 18:28:24 Let's not get too excited, yet.  Repubs need to hold the Senate.
2686 2018-06-27 18:28:23 They're an option at most places here these days. But for KFC they had thin chips but not so thin that all you could taste is the frying Oil and salt like mcD's.  combined with their gravy and it was a highlight of my childhood.
2687 2018-06-27 18:28:20 Why do they do such a - in my eyes criminal - thing?
Is it the money they save by not using oil or gas? It's all about money, right? Noone can tell me they do this because it's allegedly 'eco'. If it were so....
But they are destroying lives here.
2688 2018-06-27 18:28:11 Turkana County residents on Wednesday stopped five trucks from ferrying crude oil to Mombasa over rising insecurity along the border with Baringo.

ALL THESE ARE EXPENSIVE FOR A BROKE ASS WOMAN LIKE ME GAHSHDHDHDJ I AM SO PISSED
2691 2018-06-27 18:28:01 Mainly because of HUMAN OVERPOPULATION causing loss of habitat and greater demand for resources such as Palm Oil and rubber. Indonesia's population increased from 69,543,000 in 1950 to 266,771,900 in 2018. HUMAN OVERPOPULATION is the elephant in the room that everybody ignores.

2699 2018-06-27 18:27:15 Joe Jackson died today. He is not in heaven. "He would make you strip nude first. He would oil you down. It would be a whole ritual. He would oil you down so when the flip of the ironing cord hit you, you know... it was just like dying."-MJ

2710 2018-06-27 18:26:23 I have an idea to control hurricane By using satellites to determine the focus & direction of the hurricane the susceptible area is continuously sprayed daily (until the hurricane arrive the beach ) with vegetable oil in the pathway of hurricane

2714 2018-06-27 18:25:52 As a Somali people, we cannot accept to extract our oil gas from Ogaden oilfields without the consent of the local people, it must be their clear agreement between true represent of Our local people, the federal government, Proper Somali regional government, and the oil companies
2715 2018-06-27 18:25:52 Far from damaging the brain it's actually restorative. This is why people with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's improve dramatically from cannabis oil.
2716 2018-06-27 18:25:48 It is funny how everyone is suprised. Dan was selling snake oil.
2717 2018-06-27 18:25:41 Someone asked me for my cookie recipe recently and I can't remember who... so if you are out there, here it is. The tapioca flour can be omitted and I use coconut oil instead of canola. Also I add an extra handful of flour, an extra teaspoon of vanilla and roll mine in sugar
2718 2018-06-27 18:25:39 Luv going to get my oil changed when all these guys try to tell me everything’s wrong with my car... duh, it’s a Jeep
2719 2018-06-27 18:25:38 Not sure, this is the first Subaru my familys owned. The subaru hasnt had engine issues since we fixed it. The original owner didnt take care of it at all, its missing its rims, and has rust on the back tires quarter, other then that its okay. We believe he didnt put oil in it.
2720 2018-06-27 18:25:25 Bruh all you need is sum coconut oil & sum consistent  in ya face. Thank me later

2723 2018-06-27 18:24:57 Coconut oil, almond oil, argan Moroccan oil
2724 2018-06-27 18:24:57 Lmaoooo I’m just asking! I wasn’t being shady ... Shady would’ve been asking how much vegetable oil she used 
2725 2018-06-27 18:24:56 As a Somali people, we cannot accept to extract our oil gas from Ogaden oilfields without the consent of the local people, it must be their clear agreement between true represent of Our local people, the federal government, Proper Somali regional government, and the oil companies
2726 2018-06-27 18:24:46 11% beard oil by volume
2727 2018-06-27 18:24:44 Today, my Mexican friends truly understand what it is to be Norwegian; having an identity entirely constructed around vast oil reserves and hate towards the Swedes.

2729 2018-06-27 18:24:39 maybe he has a lot of oil revenue in the EU, and is scared of losing it
2730 2018-06-27 18:24:37 Excellent will and Ginsberg is like 900 years old she can’t be that far behind
2731 2018-06-27 18:24:35 I put Vetiver and Peace oil on Zoie and I last night and we slept so good! Zoie just woke up 15 min ago! It’s almost 11:30!
2732 2018-06-27 18:24:20 I use a vape, but I've heard oil is better. But the oil apparently tastes like arse, so I'm quite happy with my rainbow coloured vape with lower strength CBD juice that tastes like skittles haha
2733 2018-06-27 18:24:19 Im going to call up 6 of my DC friends and devise a plan for one of us, everyday of the week, to head over to ruth bader ginsburg’s and prepare her a lovely breakfast of a veggie omelette, bacon, strawberries  and a fish oil capsule until Trump is gone.
2734 2018-06-27 18:24:18 The internet has just informed me that I can make my own with chocolate drops and coconut oil, so vegan version, here I come. Of course, I'll need to travel to the nearest city to get vegan ice cream, but it's still worth it.
2735 2018-06-27 18:24:14 Well, if Trump does, we will find out pretty fast what a horrible person Garland is.
2736 2018-06-27 18:24:06 No, the price of oil has been going up, and wholesale gas prices, to be fair to them.
2737 2018-06-27 18:23:54 Sorry but if you don’t have olive oil your “KiTcHEn” doesn’t count
2738 2018-06-27 18:23:48 Try coconut oil it was an absolute lifesaver for me!

2740 2018-06-27 18:23:31 France, Italy, UK & U.S. are concerned about announcement that Ras Lanuf & Sidra oil fields & facilities will be transferred to the control of an entity other than the legitimate National Oil Corporation. #Libya’s oil facilities, production & Revenues-----------------------------
2741 2018-06-27 18:23:22 Witch Hazel helps, but smells like hot dog water. I used to put that on when I would break out, made me less red. Current skincare: wash with a gentle cleanser, sometimes I use Panoxyl when I’m broken out, then I put coconut oil on!!!! COCONUT OIL 10/10 RECOMMEND!!!!!!!!!! 
2742 2018-06-27 18:23:13 ma peau elle est bien douce la, coconut oil 
2743 2018-06-27 18:23:11 Having to get this oil change is hurting my bank account 
2744 2018-06-27 18:23:03 Your generosity has bought 5lbs rice, 4lbs beans and 1.5 qts cooking oil for 11 families. Thank you, I’m happy to do the shopping any time.  #BAONPDX
2745 2018-06-27 18:22:54 tea tree oil makes my skin feel like it ON FIRE sad gay tears
2746 2018-06-27 18:22:41 Doubt it. Peak litness is like peak oil.
2747 2018-06-27 18:22:40 A country cannot have two governments, and specially national revenues must go to the legitimate government, otherwise it'd lead to power struggle & civil-war. An international naval force should impose full blockade of all oil exports from the illegal exporters, return to Libya
2748 2018-06-27 18:22:30 So US companies can take the oil???
2749 2018-06-27 18:22:14 but then you get into feeding someone tons of sugary low fat foods. knowing what i know now about insulin i would rather puree meat or eggs and grease is down with butter or olive oil.
2750 2018-06-27 18:21:56 Olive oil pressure on .. gujju bhai...to fund bikaau bongy baba..now the equation is solved 
2751 2018-06-27 18:21:48 @NutellaGlobal Sadly because of you use of palm oil and your contribution to deforestation I can no longer buy your product. Please change your manufacturing processes and contribute to the world.
2752 2018-06-27 18:21:35 Citrus oil spray near the door.
2753 2018-06-27 18:21:32 Lmao y’all remember when we used coconut oil for everything?
2754 2018-06-27 18:21:32 That sounds crazy. I've done butter and coconut oil as well in my coffee. That's tasty af.
2755 2018-06-27 18:21:13 and in oil and gas sector has the good citizens of this bill. One project. 5/5
2756 2018-06-27 18:21:09 U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday it was important India cut Iranian oil use, but said the United States would work to allow India to use an Iranian port as corridor to Afghani...
2757 2018-06-27 18:21:01 I think I almost killed myself by suffocation with the new oil I got for my diffuser the percentage of air was probably 99% Oil Mist the 1% was regular oxygen. Slept like a baby though. Or maybe I was just in a self induced coma 
2758 2018-06-27 18:20:55 I have total faith that you'd come out on top in any wrestling scenario, no matter what the terrain whether it be mud, baby oil or demon blood.
2759 2018-06-27 18:20:51 FYI I haven’t forgot the oil vid did scary goal, I just haven’t had a chance yet but soon!
2760 2018-06-27 18:20:49 Crypto-Italians always try to infiltrate food arguments. The trick to getting rid of them is to say you don't use olive oil
2761 2018-06-27 18:20:46 I use men razors ONLY. And I shave with conditioner. Then while in the shower I face the water away from me and put baby oil cocoa shea butter all over! Like a good bit. I just buy the biggest bottle and keep it in the shower.
2762 2018-06-27 18:20:43 For 2018 inversion call to happen now, it would need to be from August 31st to the end of the year. The U.S. economic data should be fine, pushing the fed to still hike rates. Global PMI data and emerging markets get softer but if oil breaks under $59 that should cross 10/2's
2763 2018-06-27 18:20:35 Thank you!! I’ve been looking into a lot of their products. The issue I’m coming across is that so many brands claim to be non-comedogenic but then have beeswax, shea butter, or coconut oil which are super moisturizing, but clog pores. My skin is so acne prone, I’m nervous lol
2764 2018-06-27 18:20:33 Had pizza with cbd oil in LA last week. Almost certain they just threw hella olive oil to make it shiny cause I felt nothing.

2768 2018-06-27 18:19:54 Why?? The dude still has speed, can help with PK, and would definitely add a veteran presence the oil need
2769 2018-06-27 18:19:51 You know it!  Lol.
2770 2018-06-27 18:19:43 Do you use oil? I’ve had CBD suggested to me in a few forms but haven’t had time to try different things to see what’s best yet
2771 2018-06-27 18:19:37 Cocoanut oil might just do the trick too, and be safe for them to ingest 
2772 2018-06-27 18:19:29 See having bloomin’ AA certificated restaurant inspectors as your friends, you have a soufflé that falls, once, and that’s it. No more truffle oil for you, sir.
2773 2018-06-27 18:19:27 Oil up $4 lol... We shoulda seen some downside...
2774 2018-06-27 18:19:26 Bullish oil. Seeking for alpha.

2777 2018-06-27 18:19:14 Potable water is the new Oil
2778 2018-06-27 18:19:09 Oil for what?
2779 2018-06-27 18:19:03 石油だってオリーブオイルだって牛脂だって仲間さ、そうだろう?
2780 2018-06-27 18:19:01 You voted for a snake oil salesman mobster charading as a “businessman.”  You were duped.  How’s that tax cut working out for you?

2787 2018-06-27 18:18:17 Coconut oil
2788 2018-06-27 18:18:16 It is part of Trump politics. Look, Haley is right now in India to cut #oil deal, But to serve billion people this is not going to work. So tension is high, #risk market
2789 2018-06-27 18:17:48 The fact Chiarelli, as GM of an NHL team, has ANYTHING to do with the WHL's Oil Kings is absurd. I'd get it more if he were just OEG POHO & the Oilers had their own GM under Pete.

2797 2018-06-27 18:16:52 google "burning effigy of george bush" an you will see a lot of incivility.  At the time, the news (narrative industry) was constantly showing people calling Bush a racist, touting the line blood for oil, over emphasizing a person because they like calling Bush a murder.
2798 2018-06-27 18:16:38 i’ve been putting aloe vera and coconut oil. i am all lubed up rn. i’m still in pain lmao
2799 2018-06-27 18:16:31 So, subsidies to oil and gas companies? :)
2800 2018-06-27 18:16:17 Well not everything he say is b. s. But this one sure is. I found quite a few of his statement and or choices to be bull shit! Especially some of the papers that he has signed! Such as breaking up our national parks , letting his oil rich buds drill for oil and use fracking !

2803 2018-06-27 18:16:05 One thing about Iran is why the front month contract when really November oil trade period is the true affected month(s). Regarding the liquidity I wouldn't dare call a top. The thing turned on its head at a level of massive credit facility. Cant prove but sure looked like it.
2804 2018-06-27 18:16:00 Coconut oil is overblown in the popular media. Clinical studies with epilepsy patients agree that is causing abdominal symptoms. It is our experience as well. It is the best to be guided by real-world experience (=patient feedback) than relying on ambiguous sources or theories.
2805 2018-06-27 18:15:46 Can be eye opening sometimes. Latest oil price slump has cut a huge amount of waste & deadwood from the industry. When it’s $100+ no one gives a shit about costs.
2806 2018-06-27 18:15:33 U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday it was important India cut Iranian oil use, but said the United States would work to allow India to use an Iranian port as corridor to Afghani...
2807 2018-06-27 18:15:31 First @ONECodeBase meetup, super interesting! A lot of exciting things happening Aberdeen if you look away from the oil and gas sector 
2808 2018-06-27 18:15:31 My mother used to love that stuff. Couldn’t get enough. 
Don’t know about any other birds it applies to but emu oil is like liquid gold to some.
2809 2018-06-27 18:15:28 Where is Tz's economic diplomacy? There is a Tanzam oil pipeline and how was a Tanzam gas pipeline never been thought of when the gas is locally produces but the oil is imported?

2811 2018-06-27 18:15:24 Almost to my inversion call for 2018 but with oil over $70 it will still be hard to get there in 2018. Going to have to wait for August 31st and after for a shot at a inversion

2819 2018-06-27 18:14:22 Sunburn Remedy I live by - apply white distilled vinegar & coconut oil to the area 3-5 times/day, & within a few days your burn will be gone. The vinegar removes the redness, & the coconut oil keeps it from peeling.

This has been life lessons with Becca Briggs, you're welcome.

2839 2018-06-27 18:12:21 RT @MontanaSkeptic1 - thanks for sharing this post with all of us.  $TSLA is truly the new #Enron, and #Elon is a modern-day snake oil salesman.
2840 2018-06-27 18:12:11 Now I wonder if Justice Kennedy was offered a little piece of the Russian oil deal.

2843 2018-06-27 18:11:58 It's not mustard or mayonnaise based. It isn't dressed with oil. 

How do you feel about cottage cheese?

2862 2018-06-27 18:10:16 ethanol is cheap right now for many reasons (tariffs,corn $, over production, a large seller always selling, etc...) RBOB is on fire due to oil prices (US seeking to eliminate iran as an exporter to our allies, opec, oil stocks drawing, demand) lot of reasons but those are a few
2863 2018-06-27 18:10:09 なんね
2864 2018-06-27 18:10:07 yep and THC actually does work as a catalyst for the absorption of the CBD. In cali, I put Hemp(THC) oil on my legs (I had every muscle cut out sewn back in, my leg sawed in half & 5inch rods drilled in both legs) & it took my swelling down 2 NOTHING. I've NEVER had that....

2866 2018-06-27 18:10:03 No one cares about rohingyas at least not enough to do anything because they are Muslims and these people have no oil to offer - that’s the fact. It’s as if the displacement the ethnicity cleaning didn’t and isn’t happening.
2867 2018-06-27 18:09:46 Those same trolls still claim there is no oil in the Weald Basin. Can't wait to prove them wrong. Not long not until first sighting of tankers leaving HH.

2871 2018-06-27 18:09:33 We don't care the oil is in bargah not in Tripolitania , you are pushing us towards Russia ,this gov in Tripoli don't pay wages in the east or treat cancer patients they spend it on militias and terrorist , we had enough bullshit !!!!!!
2872 2018-06-27 18:09:15  ALERT: #GasPrices appear to be rising to $3.05/gal in #Michigan today. Late in the day! Likely due to large jump in oil.

2874 2018-06-27 18:09:12 Best way to cook tripe is with plenty of olive oil. That way, it slides so much easier from the plate into the bin.

2877 2018-06-27 18:09:01 @helloalle try the castor oil again sometime! It takes at least a whole growth cycle to see a difference. I think even Latisse wouldn't give you results in a week. Your brows already look good, though. You should see mine ;)
2878 2018-06-27 18:08:50 If the UK became 100% #ZeroCarbon we would halve our national trade deficit. And in 2016 the US imported $53B of oil from #Canada (3.3 million barrels per day) but US energy exports to Canada were only $14B. So why won't #Trump go green to cut the Trade deficit?

2890 2018-06-27 18:07:51 The difference is the extent of subsidies. Oil,gas coal is produced much cheaper & dependably than solar & wind. In turn those companies have made huge donations to infrastructure & services than renewable s.There has been huge advances in clean fossil technologies on environment
2891 2018-06-27 18:07:40 #Dilu I'm an Altruist ! I even fall for a snake oil salesman !
2892 2018-06-27 18:07:36 If Iran stops selling oil they really go broke. It’s horrible for the people. But the poorer people get, the more they fight back. This is the only way to get rid of the regime.
2893 2018-06-27 18:07:23 /rlt/ extra virgin olive oil buat muka bisa ga sih?..
2894 2018-06-27 18:07:14 #OOTT dollar index is relevant only when dollar is falling and bullish for oil. Stronger dollar does not affect oil :)

2896 2018-06-27 18:07:10 We have no problem with that as long as it profits Ethiopians, Somalians and all the nearest African nations. African lands has been taken advantage of for far too long for over a century by every non African and they became billionaires out of our gold and diamond and oil...
2897 2018-06-27 18:06:58 Now Cletus, that's not very nice language. Please return to your basement and continue rubbing the oil on your bullae-covered nipples.

2900 2018-06-27 18:06:29 How does this oil crisis affect the average citizen? Within a day of Hafter's statement some staple foods have gone up 50 percent. The average family is already stretched to the limit. I am not a Hafter fangirl but am completely pissed at the GNA for allowing us to get to this.
2901 2018-06-27 18:06:14 On a serious note, does this mean no oils either? I’ve seen a number of patients utilizing oil to digest due to lack of being able to smoke. That as well as pills. But not sure how Utah’s system works.
2902 2018-06-27 18:06:13 Why did I send money and diapers to relieve Texans after hurricane Harvey when the state of Texas literally has a 10 billion dollar rainy day fund from oil revenue? There’s misappropriation of money across the country at different levels of government. Undocumented immigrants
2903 2018-06-27 18:05:57 Also few drops because I’m addicted and need more to add to my collection  and of course fairy oil
2904 2018-06-27 18:05:54 Thanks for such a swift response. This is the second time this is happening, last year happened the same they took 10k from each house and 5k last month to change oil or something like that of transformer. Let me send you reference number and contact details.
2905 2018-06-27 18:05:54 Yes mate. They were given a live airing last friday. They are BEASTS
2906 2018-06-27 18:05:48 Oh no honey, I know having a sick baby is so upsetting. Good u r going to Vet. For blockage i gave my cat olive oil in tuna It took 12 hrs and he pooped out a straw. I freaked. I hope your baby feels better soon. 
2907 2018-06-27 18:05:42 I decided to join twitter to follow scientists & have a non-political, non-activist, non-gay media source. 

But how can I do that when:
-unions are being gutted
-children are being removed from their families & held in camps
-and National monuments are being destroyed for oil?
2908 2018-06-27 18:05:37 I need to get an oil change
2909 2018-06-27 18:05:37 There has to be a better way to help these people. They’re coming here out of fear. We should treat them humanely. 

Too bad there’s no oil in El Salvador. We would send our military, topple the government, clear out the gangs and make it a safer place to export resources.

2913 2018-06-27 18:05:24 What works, injecting testosterone 3 days a week, inject HCG 3 alternate days a week. Take lycopene, lysine, pumpkin seed oil to prevent DHT from forming and to have more free T
2914 2018-06-27 18:05:12 It seems to me you're the only one running from the truth with your hashtag. Wrong year hahaha but next you'll tell me that there are alternative facts hahah y'all so silly. Nobody takes you seriously.
2915 2018-06-27 18:04:59 Stop pressurising india to cut oil import from iran..
2916 2018-06-27 18:04:56 It’s the only thing that I put on my hand in the last few minutes that I can think of  coconut oil made my hair so soft as well even if it was a nightmare to get out  I just have these tiny bumps on my palm now it’s gross
2917 2018-06-27 18:04:52 Totally agree on oil and latex condoms being unsafe but silicone is safe with all condoms and oil is safe with polyurethane and nitrile.
2918 2018-06-27 18:04:28 After the 1973 oil shock, the “Shah’s reputation took a nosedive in the Western media”. #AmazingHistory #CVHF #Iran
2919 2018-06-27 18:04:24 I think with Obrador in office Mexico will be importing more and more oil and natural gas from Texas.
2920 2018-06-27 18:04:24 They won't let you have solar and now want to police who we get our oil from..what is this fuckery?
2921 2018-06-27 18:04:23 yup. and according to @GasBuddyGuy refined products aren't spiking the same way crude oil is. yet. and really it matters in october & November
2922 2018-06-27 18:04:17 Oil in red yet, and  the market will go in a crash
2923 2018-06-27 18:04:16 Lovely bike but be real it’s 2018 and no current engine design should use that much oil. Lazy BMW, what about the emissions. Milking it :(
2924 2018-06-27 18:04:07 I’m at Midas getting an oil change and the finest nigga just walked in 
2925 2018-06-27 18:03:45 What sort of oil is it? Is it one you can fry things in?
2926 2018-06-27 18:03:42 My oil fragrance poured on the floor. Like half 
2927 2018-06-27 18:03:40 Isn't the price of oil dropping or did I imagine that. They are worried about electric and hybrid increasing use??
2928 2018-06-27 18:03:34 Oil can Boyd was in the league he was a good sport he never pitched there were lots of good players though
2929 2018-06-27 18:03:12 Without a pipeline to tidewater, I’d agree. But once built, the fact that oil consumption is growing every single year with no “peak oil” in sight, and Canada having the third largest oil reserve on the planet...WTI at $77...I would suggest mega projects will indeed return.
2930 2018-06-27 18:03:06 Is this the same snake oil salesdude that used to cry on television?
2931 2018-06-27 18:02:54 1. They often pay a lot in local taxes and state taxes.  One of main reasons for so much poverty in USA Is the trillions of dollars a year governments give to corporate welfare queens each year. Pollution from coal and oil increase health care costs by trillions of dollars over
2932 2018-06-27 18:02:48 It must have gone walkabout if it has been lost! I suspect the truth is that transformers need maintaining, like cars with (cooling) oil which has to be changed, but not done. The state of the distribution network has been commed as prob and now roosting. The fix may not be quick
2933 2018-06-27 18:02:40 Welcome to my world, oil by the case, not the year

2940 2018-06-27 18:01:43 Politics of oil here in the US are very, very simple. What is the posted price for gasoline at the corner stores. If they making up numbers for political reasons I assume meaning to make prices go lower not higher.

2945 2018-06-27 18:01:16 I got a big piece of steak stuck in my esophagus two days ago and my bfs cousins (they’re nurses) told me to swallow a couple tablespoons of hot oil. Did that, it was disgusting. And I still had it lodged in my throat. So I wake up today and google ...
2946 2018-06-27 18:01:10 the next thing that happens is the Indian oil min calls up Exxon, Hess, Pioneer, Continental etc. to get a real idea of whether US can actually supply them that oil and I think we all know the answer to that.
2947 2018-06-27 18:01:05 Venezuelan officials will be allowed as soon as the price of oil goes back up.

1. I love Olive Garden.
2. Olive Pendergast from Easy A. I have seen Easy A 47 times, grand movie. 
3. Olive oil makes everything better. 
4. As a kid I hated olives. Now I don’t. #growth

2961 2018-06-27 18:00:08 Did you know that Ethiopia will start producing crude oil tomorrow? Until the pipeline is ready for export via Djibouti, the same product will be distributed to cement factories!

2967 2018-06-27 17:59:26 Exactly. The wording at the beginning threw me off. The LNA has been protecting the oil for quite a time now, the only hiccups have occurred after being attacked. 
This recent decision was not spur of the moment or done in a vacuum. It was a reaction to an attack.
2968 2018-06-27 17:59:17 Took a half day so after my doctors appointment I'm getting this oil changed!!

2970 2018-06-27 17:58:49 Let's be clear that when technology regresses there is a far greater problem afoot, that's a dark age. Technology is part of why we have both cell phones and shale oil. Tech in short moves linearly, and when it doesn't, that's a catastrophe.

2972 2018-06-27 17:58:46 Yeah! USA USA USA - A Harley without oil leaks and poor performance just ain’t no Harley! We don’t want no good motorcycles! We want us something to match our leather costumes.
2973 2018-06-27 17:58:43 Call me undemocratic but its high time the Govt clamp down on Nigerian media houses who are trying to plunge us into another civil war.

2974 2018-06-27 17:58:34 Thanks, Y/E. Any Engineering is possible. In terms of least cost of transportation, the order is: 1. Pipelines for oil 2. Waterways for cargo 3.

2986 2018-06-27 17:57:18 Do you honestly believe there’s no difference between a candidate who takes donations from big banks, big pharma, and big oil, and one who builds their campaign around small donations?

How profoundly naive. It’s all RIGHT THERE, and you still refuse to see it. Remarkable.

2990 2018-06-27 17:56:47 There are good changes that we will have a repeat of the early '90ies: general market correction and oil/oil stocks up.
2991 2018-06-27 17:56:44 Well, at least the FEMALE block was checked with her nomination. Leftist and reality are like oil and water. In reality her nomination checked two blocks....Minority and female. Why do folks keep saying Barry has no legacy, of course he do....LOSER!

2994 2018-06-27 17:56:30 I like gold better to also benefit from USD weakness (if oil rips), but EMFX weakness and thus higher gold prices seems to already be weighing on demand. Both are good though and UST has the benefit of heavy short positioning (just dont like BEI w/oil). Prefer TIPS
2995 2018-06-27 17:56:25 @cheekywipes Impressed with the speed our latest order has been delivered... only trouble is we've been sent the wrong essential oil. Can you rectify please? IN87115

2997 2018-06-27 17:56:19 Good.  We need to break our dependence on foreign oil and gas. There are no genuine environmental reason to oppose modern fracking.

3002 2018-06-27 17:55:39 I tried to make onion rings to go with my dinner but used the wrong kinda oil to fry them in so they just went super greasy. I ate one and now my tummy hurts 
3003 2018-06-27 17:55:38 Agree this is a repeat of last year but there will be no duster as Horse Hill is already an oil discovery
3004 2018-06-27 17:55:37 Honestly same, I spent four years studying Painting but around the fourth year I realized it wasn’t what I wanted for my art... I wish now that I would’ve done something more technology/digital wise instead of fiddle around with oil paint on canvas

3006 2018-06-27 17:55:15 Every single part they buy for maintenance has vat included. From oil , filters, tyres name it. Most companies rely on the taxi business for profit. Gas stations,garages mechanics,car washes. Taxi owners do thier returns if you didn't know.
3007 2018-06-27 17:55:14 You think still a bit higher for oil??
I don’t think Brent made any new high today and WTI was almost close..??
3008 2018-06-27 17:55:10 Here is lunch(leftovers from Sunday). Zucchini noodles, chicken, italian seasonings and cheese, sauteed onions, peppers in olive oil. Baked at 350 Sunday, just nuked leftovers and so easy.

3011 2018-06-27 17:55:00 At the risk of sounding stupid, why is the USA exporting 3 million barrels a day of crude oil while gasoline prices are still too high? Of course, if it's going to Europe, Exxon & Shell will have record profits again.
3012 2018-06-27 17:55:00 That is the part that is getting me, the strange experience part!  What oil do you use?
3013 2018-06-27 17:54:46 Trumps tarrifs and NAFTA destruction will destroy the oil industry in Alberta! 
You obviously don't care about the province you live in
3014 2018-06-27 17:54:40 That'll be inflation, the recession, oil,  loads of crap. But mainly companies thinking they can get away with making that extra money. Maybe I'm cynical but I think it's higher costs and higher profit margins from perceived demand.
3015 2018-06-27 17:54:28 If Scotland gains independence and takes taxes from its oil gas, fish, renewable energies, water, whisky, food, sheep, forests, tourism.... Etc

3016 2018-06-27 17:54:26 So is the US. 
She is not proposing totalitarian socialism,

So why change the topic to Venezuela?
3017 2018-06-27 17:54:13 Nissan took three hours for an oil change and a car wash. Inconvenienced.
3018 2018-06-27 17:54:08 Did you use oil washes? Just curious because I’d love something similar for my Deathguard.
3019 2018-06-27 17:54:07 let me guess = Spaghetti al Pomodoro with side of olive oil for the bread and a glass of Prosecco ?  If so, what time so I can arrange a flight? !!
3020 2018-06-27 17:54:06 U forgot 2 cite failure of AI to monetize seats in business class fully.Reports galore of freebies aggrandized by 'extended clans' of empls wit impunity  were truly scandalous. Like most parents of my gen who worked in PSUs,mine ,in an oil PSU never got a drop of oil free ever.
3021 2018-06-27 17:54:03 Good read, but not applicable. When petrodollar ends (majority of oil price in yuan, SDRs, gold or otherwise), the US will have major fiscal crisis & inability to finance current standards of living and military expenditures. Wholly new playing field wrt China's global ambitions.

3023 2018-06-27 17:54:02 @MysteryTrader99 since we 'chatted' about oil, it has broken above your 71.99 topline....you are redrawing with higher targets I suspect?  we are going into the driving season...any pullback of significance on your radar/charting?
3024 2018-06-27 17:53:59 Yet not one of them was built in the 10 years the conservatives were in power.  Years when oil hit record prices, not once, but twice.  You are obviously a dreamer.

3035 2018-06-27 17:53:09 One of the mamy reasons why I am so concerned with climate change, that we need to use renewable energy instead of oil.

3068 2018-06-27 17:49:55 Sure, because OPEC kept supply artificially low to drive prices back up. With oil up they're taking advantage of it.
3069 2018-06-27 17:49:54 I just refuse to pay close to $50 for an oil change, that isn't even new oil
3070 2018-06-27 17:49:41 A cool thing about working remotely is that today, my office is the oil change place where they have free popcorn and pop and a coffee machine. Gonna drink my weight in sugar while I make a toolkit.

3082 2018-06-27 17:48:16 Have you looked at your profile picture? You are no oil painting. Porcine in fact.
3083 2018-06-27 17:48:16 I hate those skincare threads on twitter. Y'all got high schoolers telling u to use st.ives and coconut oil to clear ur face :/ tragic
3084 2018-06-27 17:47:58 Is it a two stroke? If not shit design, or shares in oil companies :)
3085 2018-06-27 17:47:48 Beard oil wak doyok tu menjadi tak kalau pakai? Terasa nak mencuba
3086 2018-06-27 17:47:46 They are stupid non-thinking no degree or career assholes. We pay all the bills in this country. They are lucky they can dig holes to find oil or else they'd have no use
3087 2018-06-27 17:47:39 Samers! Tumeric in my shakes and coconut oil in just about everything. It's amazing in coffee. Have you guys tried oil pulling?
3088 2018-06-27 17:47:39 Oil was not changed since 2014
3089 2018-06-27 17:47:34 Deodorant, face mist (micellar water & teatree oil), sneakers & wipes! 
3090 2018-06-27 17:47:27 I want to ask Sambit Patra , being a physician how you became a director of ONGC... Are you technically qualified for Oil & Natural Gas ???
3091 2018-06-27 17:47:25 Tried a tea rinse on my hair last night at a friend's suggestion. I think it might help, but I'll need to remember to use more conditioner/less argan oil next time.
3092 2018-06-27 17:47:23 Oil...Crude Oil.. :)

3097 2018-06-27 17:46:57 Y’all love coconut oil Bc social media told y’all to lol. I hate it
3098 2018-06-27 17:46:48 I hate having activist family members who you cant delete on social medias because they will flip. Yes I get it... you are a better person then me because you "are vegan" "grow your own food" "don't use palm oil" ... I don't care anymore.
3099 2018-06-27 17:46:45 do not get rattled by this oil move....expecting a significant sell off when we enter primary 5th wave....sooner or later
3100 2018-06-27 17:46:43 @myoimoina @nanaoeyang Jojoba oil.
3101 2018-06-27 17:46:37 OPEC/NOPEC isn't going to produce more because of 1 week's worth of export data from the US that they KNOW is still largely oil exported to Canada. Aramco doesn't look at that # & say "oh no, we must now produce 11.3 million bpd in July"
3102 2018-06-27 17:46:35 My bad cbd oil for sure... I know if you go to the pet stores they usually have some sort of anxiety snacks or calming snacks. I got some for my cats when I moved.
3103 2018-06-27 17:46:35 It’s got lemon juice  but no oil!
3104 2018-06-27 17:46:32 And of course there's oil.
3105 2018-06-27 17:46:30 This weather makes me super angry at the people who thrive so desperately for a tan they'll wear baby oil/brag about how burnt they are.. it's not funny youre literally COOKING YOUR SKIN just stop
3106 2018-06-27 17:46:29 If my car jack was big enough, I'd change my own oil. 
3107 2018-06-27 17:46:23 Neil Cavuto @TeamCavuto is so disgusting, his constant attacks on our economy, his NeverTrump crap, now when going to a meeting there is this turkey on a hall tv screen again calling Trump a monster for "threatening" those who want to buy Iranian oil. Everyone is sick of Cavuto.
3108 2018-06-27 17:46:17 what did they do before Palm Oil ..
3109 2018-06-27 17:46:12 To be clear, the “harmful policies at home” are those of Justin Trudeau, as it relates to pipelines. Donald Trump’s lack of appreciation & understanding of environmental concerns prompted the migration of oil activity from Canada to USA.
3110 2018-06-27 17:46:11 I'm almost sorry we said no to an exit back then to, Saudi Arabia under US flag, the oil industry. Who expected to see Romania like this
3111 2018-06-27 17:45:47 Happy Birthday sir. May your oil not run dry. You are a blessing to this generation!
3112 2018-06-27 17:45:45 Have you missed out olive oil and lemon juice 
3113 2018-06-27 17:45:44 The key issue the Putin visit, is trump finding a way to lift sanction on Russia & Putin minions to allow the trump tower but more important the OIL DEAL trump was given 19 % share can’t be realized until those sanctions are removed ; the OPEC deal is in place , now trump/Putin ?
3114 2018-06-27 17:45:42 Check your Transmission oil this Sunday.
3115 2018-06-27 17:45:39 The way some girls love cars makes me think they were breast fed with Engine Oil.

3116 2018-06-27 17:45:38 Need to buy a good oil for my face
3117 2018-06-27 17:45:36 She’s so fat if she wears a black one piece swimsuit she’s gonna look like an oil spill
3118 2018-06-27 17:45:34 #oil sanctions won’t stop sale of iran’s crude but it will force Iran to discount its price... which will cause Iran to pump more oil to achieve revenue neutrality. This is actually a little bearish medium term IMHO.  I’m buying puts
3119 2018-06-27 17:45:32 "Having COWS is why they are this powerful.

What if they had CRUDE OIL?"
Henry Shield
3120 2018-06-27 17:45:22 Better ask at what price Russia sells oil to Baltics
3121 2018-06-27 17:45:22 LOL... twitter is a maze of sharp implements and vats of bubbling oil for frying starchy food items to golden crispy goodness. So scary for our sweet Tater.
3122 2018-06-27 17:44:56 Big blow to all the Union members who you swindled into voting for you. Hopefully they wake up next term and realize the Republican Party is against them. I’d also like to state for the record, I didn’t fall for your snake oil salesman routine.
3123 2018-06-27 17:44:51 @Deconnect_off You gotta make an essential oil diffuser for the top of #gloo. Would be a perfect combo
3124 2018-06-27 17:44:32 The nuclear deal is dead. Countries that import a drop of oil from Iran also support nuclear weapons and destruction and must face the most severe sanctions in the United States. The United States must show the superpower of the world
3125 2018-06-27 17:44:24 Germany got what is deserved.  You can't just mail it in to the world cup anymore.  Every team is dangerous.  You saw that with Iran, Morocco, Peru, etc.  Unfortunately they ran out of ideas and Mezut Oil was a mess this WC. Hats off to #KOR for getting the job done
3126 2018-06-27 17:44:18 changing the air filter is so easy, like 3 minutes on most cars, no one does it or they pay the retards at an oil change place $50 to
3127 2018-06-27 17:44:02 Just rubbed natural yoghurt on Lucy cos she’s a thick bitch and a whacked the oil on her on the first day
3128 2018-06-27 17:44:01 the nastiest part is that oil doesnt really mix with water so imagine just getting a straight up sip of the lemon oil sitting at the top and feeling the burn as it travels to your stomach
3129 2018-06-27 17:43:40 Office lunch: leftover steak, sweet pepper, onion, spinach salad with an improvised dressing from avacado oil, Sriracha, soy sauce, salt, and pepper. 

I'm getting better at this.
3130 2018-06-27 17:43:35 When I was a little Italian-American Catholic girl, I thought Jesus was anointing the heads of the apostles with olive oil. Anyone else?....anyone? #addsomeparmesan2that
3131 2018-06-27 17:43:07 @TeamCavuto So much for USA having enough oil from the Dakotas. Hey, gas prices always climb before the big holidays in America
3132 2018-06-27 17:43:07 Indira Gandhi had the guts to tell the then US President on his face not to threaten India but Modi doesn't have the guts to tell dictator Trump the new-NAZI that not to poke his dirty nose in our affair whether we will import oil from Iran or not.
3133 2018-06-27 17:43:06 Very well said.  One good deed in exchange for multiple potential bad ones makes no logical sense.   Islam is to western nations as oil is to water, they don't mix!
3134 2018-06-27 17:42:57 Every foundation I have tried make my skin feel like a oil spill...
3135 2018-06-27 17:42:55 Oy vey, better shag that MotherTrucker for all the oil it's worth. Still won't melt the steel beams, though.
3136 2018-06-27 17:42:50 Why not do it all ;) If you need an oil change, let us know! We can help you find the best deal in your area.
3137 2018-06-27 17:42:49 use ice cubes, honey, aloe vera, and oil (coconut, vitamin e) 
3138 2018-06-27 17:42:46 The moment you claimed those places are true models of success in America, was the moment you were exposed as a moron. Houston for example..... has one of the largest gaps between the wealthy (conservative oil money) and the poor (welfare class socialism.)
3139 2018-06-27 17:42:40 So my stupid ass fell asleep with that oil face mask on the other night and my face been swollen since then.
3140 2018-06-27 17:42:23 Leave-in, a styling product, & maybe an oil is all I use
3141 2018-06-27 17:42:21 Did Putin promise not to help the SAA if they plan to reclaim Golan heights after clearing the terrorists from the SW? That's what ISrael fear the most (losing all that oil & gas money).
3142 2018-06-27 17:42:19 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I
will fear no evil: for thou [art] with me; thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
3143 2018-06-27 17:42:16 Sorry to hear about you bad experience. Next time you need an oil change or car repairs, let us know. We'll help you find the best mechanic for your needs.
3144 2018-06-27 17:42:07 Dollar and oil both up; gold and stocks down.  What a weird time.
3145 2018-06-27 17:42:07 No olive oil or coconut oil= Use sweet almond oil (unless you have a hit allergy)
Deodorant= use baking soda. (Can be messy with darker clothes) for better results mix with coconut oil
Facial toner= use apple cider vinegar diluted in water
3146 2018-06-27 17:41:53 All Ethiopians listen.
Ogadenia is not Ethiopians we’re Somalians 
And soon we’re going to be our own country so please ethio people stop thinking about our oil and gas and get out of our ogadenia country. 
It’s ogadenias people who can discuss and talk about their oil not you
3147 2018-06-27 17:41:49 Use the Body Shop night time tea tree oil blemish stuff. So freaking good.
3148 2018-06-27 17:41:41 coconut oil is buck wild, the same shit that I condition my hair and skin with is the same shit that I fry my plaintains in. and now apparently it’s being used as lube???? bananas
3149 2018-06-27 17:41:26 Does anybody else dog like to eat coconut oil? I can put coconut oil on my legs and Kali will come and lick it right off.
3150 2018-06-27 17:41:17 Shutting down the oil industry. Hmn. You don't think going from 100 barrel oil to less than 30 had more than something to do with it? I honestly don't know what to say here if people can't even recognize that particular fact.
3151 2018-06-27 17:41:17 I tried it... Leaked oil, never again.
3152 2018-06-27 17:41:16 If you need an oil change, we can help you find the best deal in your area! Let us know :)
3153 2018-06-27 17:41:11 Virgin  Oil really helps my hair grow.
3154 2018-06-27 17:41:04 Without bold US action Turkey will not budge. Erdogan must be charged with crimes against humanity, cut off military aid & an oil embargo.
3155 2018-06-27 17:40:59 The oil price decline began in mid-2014. I am simply saying that the multi-billion dollar oil sands mega-projects, which fuelled Alberta's development economy, are a thing of the past.
3156 2018-06-27 17:40:54 Joint Statment by US, UK, France, Italy "These vital Libyan resources must remain under the exclusive control of the legitimate National Oil Corporation and the sole oversight of the GNA, as outlined in UN Security Council Resolutions 2259 (2015), 2278 (2016), and 2362 (2017).
3157 2018-06-27 17:40:48 DPR remains complicit in the rot that is the oil sector. But their pay is good and to top it, bribes plenty yakata.

NCC ha, as useless as an old bone hung infront of a door to keep house safe. 

SON doesn't exist unless to get license fee and bribes thru testing products.
3158 2018-06-27 17:40:47 How did action figures get so expensive? Lack of sales making the per unit cost higher or just oil prices
3159 2018-06-27 17:40:34 Bio oil
3160 2018-06-27 17:40:34 Exactly. The Syrian people voted for president Assad. It's their decision who should lead Syria- not the oil companies who control the American presidents (all of them). When these US-backed radical jihadists looked like they would succeed, Syria asked Russia to help & they did.
3161 2018-06-27 17:40:30 Let’s transport more oil by rail instead  of a pipeline.  Definitely safer.  Idiots!
3162 2018-06-27 17:40:24 咎さんも猫苦手なのか…

3164 2018-06-27 17:40:06 いや…ちょ、やめろっ！耳からはさすがに油飲めないから！
3165 2018-06-27 17:39:53 It really soothes the scalp if you have a itchy or dry one. And it’s not thick either like castor oil
3166 2018-06-27 17:39:41 No.  If one flag flies, all flags fly.  I have Australian friends and Nigerian, and Tunisian, and Egyptian and Russian, all from oil&gas work from my Aberdeen base,
3167 2018-06-27 17:39:34 bio oil works wonders for scarring!!
3168 2018-06-27 17:39:32 Pics of oil rubbed naked men hugging tranvestites AND rubbing hands on fake tits made with tankJuice mathigandu , atleast they promote LGBT
3169 2018-06-27 17:39:15 Another way Canada (and other democracies) could help us would be to sanction, in the same way democracies have sanctioned Putin's oligarchs, the Republican donors propping up the Trump regime. They shouldn't let US oil corps, banks, hedgefunds supporting Trump do business there
3170 2018-06-27 17:39:13 vitamin e oil helps Hecka w acne scars
3171 2018-06-27 17:39:02 I spilled peppermint essential oil all over my sister’s room the other day and just didn’t tell anyone and act confused every time she asks me why it smells so much like Christmas every time she goes in there
3172 2018-06-27 17:38:55 for acne scars, i recommend using a facial oil and/or vitamin c serum!!
3173 2018-06-27 17:38:45 On that tragic day of the Twin Towers all flights in out out of the World Airports there was one flight that left New York it was a flight that went to Saudi  Arabia carrying the Ben laden family who the Bush family had been dealing with for many years in the Oil Business...
3174 2018-06-27 17:38:43 I view the Vikings' salary cap like the world's oil reserves. I don't know much about either but the experts always they are fucked and then the dust settles and everything is fine.
3175 2018-06-27 17:38:43 Ugh, I hate ranting, but I have no outlet these days. A few months ago, there was an oil spill where I used to live. It kicked me in the head & I got very ill. Even though I was getting treated for the exposure, my sense of smell got heightened to everything toxic, potent, subtle
3176 2018-06-27 17:38:39 Mouthwash= mix baking soda and water together 
No Vaseline to use on your brows and lashes= use aloe Vera gel or fresh Aloe Vera
No shaving cream= use olive oil or conditioner 
No moisturizer for your face=use coconut oil or extra virgin oil (they may clog your pores)
3177 2018-06-27 17:38:37 As an early bday gift I would appreciate if someone  sent me money to get an oil change lmfao
3178 2018-06-27 17:38:23 LOL! You seriously went with a “blame Harper” response!  What else happened around that time? (Hint: oil).  Now compare foreign investment in Canada against any other resource-heavy economy.
3179 2018-06-27 17:38:16 I love pasta where I replace half of spaghetti with courgetti, then chuck in some prawns, lime juice and chili oil and done. Works well in the heat  Oh and some parmesan on top.
3180 2018-06-27 17:38:15 The secret is proper blade maintenance. You want to clean, sharpen, and oil it after use.
3181 2018-06-27 17:38:14 Talk about an oxymoron! The two ideologies go together like oil and water, fire & ice, etc.
3182 2018-06-27 17:38:14 also just moisturiser and bio oil works for me. or any tea-tree based products
3183 2018-06-27 17:38:13 I wanna buy my own wax kit so I can wax my whole body and then drench my body in baby oil
3184 2018-06-27 17:38:11 44% is it?? Will they fall for it? We should have told them more but all in all we have already harvested and still getting. Remember who found this oil? Amafuta gaffe so we should have no shame and as long as we put it in news they won’t come making noise #Mbyogedde
3185 2018-06-27 17:38:07 Valvoline: "okay that'll be $44.87" 
Me: (pulls out phone) "i have a $19.99 coupon"
Valvoline: puts in code without scanning coupon.
They be trying to rip people off knowing they got the hook up on the $20 oil changes.
3186 2018-06-27 17:37:50 $DBO - Invesco DB Oil Fund - is projected to trade 2875% of its ADV #ETF
3187 2018-06-27 17:37:48 All their hard work at landlocking and villainizing our oil industry has pain off for them.
3188 2018-06-27 17:37:47 I meant bud but i feel that in oil so hard too i love being high
3189 2018-06-27 17:37:31 Underground, the oil has no economic value. Lets mine it, and lives will gradually change.
3190 2018-06-27 17:37:31 vitamin e oil sis
3191 2018-06-27 17:37:30 Start drilling for oil?
3192 2018-06-27 17:37:14 Instead of cutting oil imports from #Iran world must cut the throats of terrorism spreading #Iranian Mullah regime led by @khamenei_ir pig, assisted by @Rouhani_ir & #IRGC terrorists operating in #Syria, #Iraq, #Yemen, #Lebanon
3193 2018-06-27 17:37:09 Still waiting to hear how much the pipeline twinning will cost us after the buy out price tag on current ageing line? This at a time when China cut a deal to buy oil from Russia, EU cutting oil usage and Trump wanting to increase the tax on crude.
3194 2018-06-27 17:37:06 Wow peppermint oil is the best thing I’ve put on my scalp
3195 2018-06-27 17:37:05 YESSSSSS! Someone who is actually invested in mother earth and not big oil! GOOD JOB, SYDNE‘S SISTER.
3196 2018-06-27 17:37:03 The sale of palm oil in the USA should be forbidden and substituted by US grown canola, corn, sunflower, peanut and olive oil.
3197 2018-06-27 17:36:55 Exxon is doing nothing and that spreads image denial. They don't even use its muscle in trade associations to isolate the active climate deniers in oil and gas. It knows exactly what it's doing. Rope a dope.
3198 2018-06-27 17:36:43 もう入ってるじゃん！！wwwww

3201 2018-06-27 17:35:58 Looking forward to @IcelandFoods Christmas  launch event tomorrow - know there will be some great palm oil free  , plastic free show stoppers !
3202 2018-06-27 17:35:51 What about palm oil in your products?
3203 2018-06-27 17:35:45 Try making fried rice with chili oil
3204 2018-06-27 17:35:42 Our rez area on oil workin well
3205 2018-06-27 17:35:37 Life would be better with an oil change

3215 2018-06-27 17:34:42 Long here albeit underweight. Was expecting to be crushed based on morning news (apart from oil).  Ended up, even took small profit on bt (average stock).
3216 2018-06-27 17:34:37 Mafia state anything is possible if billions get lost abracadabra what are oil trucks ,child play...knowing kenya that’s another scandal inthe making!
3217 2018-06-27 17:34:30 Now that is like asking @yogrishiramdev which oil can grow hair on bald head
3218 2018-06-27 17:34:30 Time to buy oil-and-gas companies a boost with higher crude prices
3219 2018-06-27 17:34:18 People living with their parents enjoy high quality life and freedom, while you judge them.
Because you moved out to go sit on Garden chairs with one onion, Soya pieces and half bottle of ole cooking oil
See your life
3220 2018-06-27 17:34:17 Funny, I was thinking the exact same thing. Wonder what causes those mass hallucinations. And why are all these old rags and olive oil bottles in my garage? And where did the kerosene come from. Man I gotta lay off the ambien.
3221 2018-06-27 17:34:17 You do realize that the reason the ice sheets are shrinking is BECAUSE OF CARBON EMISSIONS FROM OIL right?
3222 2018-06-27 17:34:13 I use Aveena Eczema Therapy and olive oil as my skin moisturizers. It’s a lil pricey but it helps hydrate and improve discoloration. Hope this helps

3225 2018-06-27 17:33:54 Your faulting @JustinTrudeau for a pipeline rupture in Nigeria? #BuyAMap Yet you and the rest of Green Peace wont say a word about the tankers of oil coming into the East Coast of Canada. More #GreenHypocrisy
3226 2018-06-27 17:33:49 As per the EIA weekly a year ago the oil price was in the $40s, but production is up almost 1.7MMbpd, at the time the most aggressive US production growth forecast was Jeff Currie at Goldman with 1MMbpd YoY.   What will it look like a year from now with oil in the 60s?
3227 2018-06-27 17:33:46 white girls pay $30 for 3 drops of essential oil n swear they doctors after
3228 2018-06-27 17:33:38 We would be a lot prouder if @JustinTrudeau didn’t just invest significantly more $ on a climate-destroying pipeline (without consulting his constituents!). Do a better job @cathmckenna.  should be getting poised to lead a greener more prosperous future- not investing in oil.
3229 2018-06-27 17:33:33 and buy oil from Saudi arab? Why? India shd buy oil from Iran cos they r ready to sell in Indian rupees!
3230 2018-06-27 17:33:25 Possible, Trump taps into the strategic oil reserves.??
3231 2018-06-27 17:33:22 What did you just said Ethiopians.
Shut up  no one who lives ogadenia is called Ethiopian. We’re Somalians 
And it’s our oil and gas nothing to do with Ethiopians #downethiopia

3236 2018-06-27 17:32:53 Bolton’s reputation as hard line antiRussian guy just got co-opted by Trump.  This is about mega billion dollar deals with the Russian state oil company Rosneft, cutting a lot of money to both Putin and Trump, poking a finger at NATO, and saying FU to the Paris Accords.
3237 2018-06-27 17:32:37 and again oil +2-3% and RSX + 0.5% . So rational markets :)
3238 2018-06-27 17:32:36 + Potable water is the new Oil

3241 2018-06-27 17:32:02 That's my point. The liberals aren't doing enough to address any of the problems on reserves. Money is the easiest problem for them to solve, but they aren't even doing that. But hey, they've got >$6 billion to waste on an oil pipeline to nowhere.
3242 2018-06-27 17:32:01 girl ...i quit oil like 4 days ago and here i am dabbing lmao
3243 2018-06-27 17:31:45 It’s barely 12pm and I’ve already went to finalize paperwork @ my new job, went to take a drug test, bought a new foundation @ the mall & got an oil change. Now I’m going to go run 
3244 2018-06-27 17:31:18 this summer i’m gonna keep a spare bikini and tanning oil in my car...just in case lol
3245 2018-06-27 17:31:12 Well shutting down the oil industry in AB by introducing regulations that end any chance of a pipeline getting built have certainly reduced fossil fuel production. Also driven billions from our economy and seen business flee to the US but climate and all that scary stuff.
3246 2018-06-27 17:31:10 When he got 45% CAGR in bull run, he took the credit !! By the way, the tweet highlights the process & 17% is good return but wont be worth the risk incured !

Would you rather have a foul-mouth Clint Eastwood type that you can depend on when the chips are down as sheriff or some sweet-talking, bull-shitting, snake oil salesman that cant shoot?

3253 2018-06-27 17:30:04 US set deadlines for countries to stop import oil from #Iran US wants india to stop Iran oil import by Nov 4 So what will be the effect. if India denied the US deadlines

3256 2018-06-27 17:29:49 I am absolutely baffled by the moves of Oil, Treasuries, Chinese Stocks and USD. There are two separate trade narratives in action simultaneously. They don't match. Maybe some weird shit is happening in Oil options market like August 2016. $OOTT $TLT $DXY

3260 2018-06-27 17:29:20 Real friends don’t let their besties go without an oil change @Ivy_davis001 

I’m the best, I know 
3261 2018-06-27 17:29:17 .@TeamCavuto If we are producing all this oil domestically why was there a 10 million barrel draw down? Where is it going? If some Prince blows wind the wrong way in Saudi Arabia the price shoots up...why? Energy independence my ass.
3262 2018-06-27 17:29:06 Try doing some maintenance? My serger kept messing up and fixed itself when I added oil to the gears

3264 2018-06-27 17:28:32 Bashir desperately wanted to have something, anything, inked and claim a diplomatic victory. What came out is an empty 'deal' whose only highlight is CoH, similar to the Dec 2017. He couldn't even hide his main interest is #oil.
Let's see how @UKenyatta plays this one
3265 2018-06-27 17:28:25 I keep gaining weight on my diet and can't figure out why. Can someone help?

Breakfast: banana with a glass of orange juice
Lunch: egg salad with a glass of water
Dinner: rice and beans with four glasses of vegetable oil
Dessert: two carrots

Should I only have one carrot?
3266 2018-06-27 17:28:02 The reason Venezuela is such a shithole isn't because it's socialist it's because they built their entire economy on oil.

3268 2018-06-27 17:27:58 New idea: get the winners of the world cup to receive oil. Let's see America get disqualified then.

3274 2018-06-27 17:27:32 It’s actually pretty good + makes the morning joe almost bulletproof caffeine + the energy boost provided by the honey, cocoa , cinnamon, coconut oil and the heavy cream supplies a healthy fat that also has energy boosting qualities. Beats cowboy black coffee

3279 2018-06-27 17:26:52 Shift is path length dependent.  Means the correction is multiplicative with Z. Also that high angle rays see more shift than axial rays, which means spherical aberration, which means your PSF is shit when you use an oil lens deep in a cell.
3280 2018-06-27 17:26:44 Market participants will continue to monitor the progress of monsoon and movement of crude oil prices & currency (INR versus USD).

3281 2018-06-27 17:26:44 So the only reason South Korea was mercilessly flogging  German like an oil well thief is because it wanted both to go home and watch the tournament from their living rooms! People can be so wicked. By the way fellow investors, this World Cup was  a BAD MARKET to trade in.

3286 2018-06-27 17:26:10 So the end of rate hikes, increased trade barriers, higher oil prices, unwinding the FEDs balance sheet and forcing jobs overseas is good for investors?  It's certainly not good for the economy and it will erode purchasing power.

3292 2018-06-27 17:25:31 Cut defense spending by about 15% (but not wages)

Change tax policy again
Close tax loopholes

3293 2018-06-27 17:25:26 You just said FoM was a good thing. We've only started using olive oil for cooking since the 1950s. Before we used only lard.
3294 2018-06-27 17:24:57 Did total reliance on Oil and Gas for 44 years teach you nothing?  Boom bust and echo cycles aren't productive.  Overproduction is what caused prices to plummet, and throw us into a recession to start with.  Now go ahead and share your plan with us instead of useless memes.
3295 2018-06-27 17:24:42 Dow just turned negative after charging up 250+ points. Just as it falls, it could rise so 3pET we're going to focus on what moved it higher (easing planned policy on Chinese investment by @realDonaldTrump)&what's hurting it now (spiking oil prices) 3pET see you then!
3296 2018-06-27 17:24:32 Probably converting them to prints. It’s not oil based though

3300 2018-06-27 17:23:58 LPT: store your almond butter upside down, so the oil is at the bottom.
3301 2018-06-27 17:23:58 Great news for those suffering from Epilepsy. The FDA has approved CBD Essential oil in the treatment of Epilepsy. Many other uses should be approved.
3302 2018-06-27 17:23:45 not trying to put the industry down, but the US economy is so much more diverse than OPEC countries that oil export numbers don't matter politically to voters or anyone in power except maybe the governor of Texas & he's already revealed his lack of sophistication in this regard
3303 2018-06-27 17:23:30 I’m all for legalizing medical marijuana for SEVERE cases. If there’s not restrictions put on this bill, it’s just going to lead to recreational and I’m sorry but our society and generation does not need that. I’m 100% for CBD oil though.

3309 2018-06-27 17:22:18 "After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, republicanism temporarily gained strength." The French King is living in England at this as a result of the french revolution. Then... along comes oil.
3310 2018-06-27 17:22:14 STORM buffers are aqueous so the correction is usually for ~1.35. My point is that aqueous mounting medium with a oil objectivf should be corrected to serve as ground truth for Z dimension? I'd expect ground truth to be something like index matched TDE or... oil
3311 2018-06-27 17:22:13 But not enough. Population is now 65m not 47m. The range of food we eat is exponentially bigger. How much olive oil do you think we can grow? 

The war’s over. The Empire is lost. Now we work with our neighbours.
3312 2018-06-27 17:22:12 Nothing to do with US demands that all nations cease buying Iranian oil.
3313 2018-06-27 17:22:07 @AEA you polled fossil fuel lovers. I am ONLY looking at hybrids and electrics, in spite of any incentives. I will not be hooked on oil.
3314 2018-06-27 17:21:59 Witch hazel gel, rosehip oil, and jojoba oil have been sooooooooooooo good to my skin
3315 2018-06-27 17:21:54 Same. If you have a sunburn, then use some lavender essential oil. It works wonders on sunburns, bug bites and for me with insomnia. Just put a few drops on the burn or bite. (For insomnia just put a few drops on your pillow.) if you need to dilate it with water for the smell

3318 2018-06-27 17:21:31 The positive about art and epilepsy is that you can often not worry about what you haven't finished yet, and simply start a new drawing or painting. Working in oil pastels is especially nice because it's a fast vibrant medium.
3319 2018-06-27 17:21:26 You mix it with olive oil and maybe another substance then you cook it and put it on your face.
3320 2018-06-27 17:21:06 just my opinion.derizor is source of energy in syria.they want to weaken iran/syrian by deny their access to oil and gas.

3322 2018-06-27 17:20:53 There is oil on your head for this.
3323 2018-06-27 17:20:52 I wonder how much $ it took oil companies to brain wash you. There are a billion cars on the road burning trillions of tons of C02 which then goes up into the atmosphere. Wtf you think it does up there?
3324 2018-06-27 17:20:47 It's so HIGHLY unlikely that the White House is calling up @T_Mason_H or @Barron_Energy or customs agents & telling them to fake numbers. The only possible political reason I could see for faking oil export data is because it makes the trade imbalance seem less

3326 2018-06-27 17:20:27 Qadday best understood what it is the west feared the most.  So he used his country's oil revenue to promote family growth.  He prmoted, and helped finance, marriage and having children among Muslims....the we considered that the financeing of terrorism.

3328 2018-06-27 17:20:13 Sorry but I make it a point never to buy any product containing palm oil whether it claims to be sustainable or not. It simply is not necessary. 

A quick stir of your pure 100% peanut butter before you take a spoonful from the jar is enough.
And the same for every other product!

3343 2018-06-27 17:18:22 OIL is very much not as nesscesstity to sustain our country but is a part of it. The resources we have in this country alone is enough to keep us vibrant. Their is too many doom mongers that don't want to believe this but it's true.We need  more positivity about our great country
3344 2018-06-27 17:17:59 sitting next to a cute girl at the walmart auto center is a real game killer because she already knows i dont know how to change oil
3345 2018-06-27 17:17:57 The WH doesn't have enough control over those levels of gov to falsify that data. There's also NO WAY this number would help politically - it won't make the news & no one will notice it. Employment data might be worth faking for an election, but oil export data - no.

3348 2018-06-27 17:17:47 Yeah I get the logic just wanted to confirm that was your thought process. TBH, that doesn't seem to be holding. Seems like the market is fixating higher oil = higher inflation expectations = higher fed funds probability.
3349 2018-06-27 17:17:41 A new pub has opened up near me, but they use mason jars as ashtrays so they lose points on that. Pros: they have Neck Oil on tap and have Lucky Chip burgers. #review
3350 2018-06-27 17:17:37 My grandpa loves to cook and we were just talking about essential oils with my cousins and he says “the only oil essential to me is olive oil” iM SCREAMING
3351 2018-06-27 17:17:29 They are selling off owned stations.  They are selling off refineries.  I think way too many people confuse big oil and merchant refiners.  

Exxon, Chevron, Shell, etc. = Big Oil

Valero, Murphy, Phillips 66 = merchant refiners.
3352 2018-06-27 17:17:15 Lumlock is way out of her depth. Former oil & gas ops manager - what does she know about trains?
3353 2018-06-27 17:17:10 Its all for Oil and hatred of Muslims...
3354 2018-06-27 17:17:08 เยสได้ไหม
3355 2018-06-27 17:16:55 Damn they all tripping then. I had got food from the one on Hillsborough Ave and they gave me old ass fried fish the oil was all in the fish and it was like they reheated it and then gave it to me from someone who left the fish meal lol
3356 2018-06-27 17:16:52 Oh man you totally proved me wrong by posting a passage talking about a "curse" for cheating which isn't even real unless you believe in witch craft, which if you do this convo is over. That is so similar to being burned in oil, or public maiming and/or death for the same thing.
3357 2018-06-27 17:16:45 Merci Mathieu pour cet excellent graphique qui tue et rend nos écolos, à commencer par Hulot, ridicules et hors-sol ! Quant à la comédie de l’accord de Paris, quasiment déifié, qui y croit encore ???
3358 2018-06-27 17:16:45 Right. Because nothing bad ever happens on “University Property.”
3359 2018-06-27 17:16:36 don’t know how people sit in the sun for hours you know I sit in it for ten minutes with factor 50 and maybe a little bit of oil end up burnt with a fucking heat rash cba I genuinely have the skin of a ginger person.
3360 2018-06-27 17:16:33 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
3361 2018-06-27 17:16:23 Also using cotton tampons are only pleasant when you lubricate it coconut oil.
3362 2018-06-27 17:16:22 Bank on it—we have real troubles, but Trump is making everything, everything worse. If he (BIG OIL) has his way, your children will not be breathing clean air.
3363 2018-06-27 17:16:18 If you want to know why laws are not enforced in #Libya then ask @UNSMILibya. Time and time again they support treason whether from a rogue general destroying his country or from a rogue politician who supports handing over Libya’s oil to an group the UN itself does not recognize
3364 2018-06-27 17:16:18 If it's an oil painting I'm in depending on price
3365 2018-06-27 17:16:18 $USO.. just seeing the move. And ppl worried about rate hikes?  Not a chance 

It's beyond stupid that oil goes from 100+ to 26 to 75. If anything in World needs to be regulated - it's oil prices

3366 2018-06-27 17:16:11 @CVSHealth Why did you stop selling CVS Health 16 oz bottles of Cod Liver Oil in your stores? You made it taste mild and it saved me from a lifetime of drugs because it also cleaned out my heart arteries and other places that have plaque buildup up.  Before and after heart scans

3372 2018-06-27 17:15:49 Just curious... If I scroll your feed will I find some anger about the train derailment that spewed oil into a river/ground?

3375 2018-06-27 17:15:33 I would be less worried about the future if we'd elected a small bottle of oil to the highest office in the land

i'm a car
3384 2018-06-27 17:14:00 You don’t you ban Saudi Arabia? Many of the 911 terrorists are from that country. Or is your business and OIL too important than our national security?
3385 2018-06-27 17:13:51 mate.... both City and Chelsea are run by Qatari or Russian oil oligarchs, go through managers and players, buy success, etc.  Many of Spurs top players are academy products or signed young, new stadium this year, bright future! also: Harry Kane enough said COYS

3387 2018-06-27 17:13:27 The Provinces that produce natural gas and oil for the rest of Canada to keep warm and running have to take the brunt of the tax. AB and Sask are suffering and the government rubs their nose in it by holding up pipelines, losing investors then charging them more. WTF?
3388 2018-06-27 17:13:07 Sis, you ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OIL her while i get scolded

3392 2018-06-27 17:12:13 Where's your plan for Alberta?  If you think you can smear Tweet the price of oil up, you're out of luck.
3393 2018-06-27 17:12:13 I wish if possible you could write the story for business students the decision and thought process of your take over attempt of Gulf that was a bold move A dude from a Private Oil co in a small office in Amarillo taking over a giant Oil co Movie in making
3394 2018-06-27 17:12:08 It’s time for me to get an oil change.
3395 2018-06-27 17:12:06 Ohhh, I'm not a huge fan of sports, but I'll cheer for Mexico I guess 
3396 2018-06-27 17:12:02 You’re responsible for this...and the high oil prices.  In two words: you lose
3397 2018-06-27 17:11:57 We import oil and export dollars. Higher oil = higher global supply of USD. 

Higher supply = lower price
3398 2018-06-27 17:11:54 Niggas think coz weed is natural... it’s good for you. “It’s from the earth bro”. So is oil. Don’t drink it.
3399 2018-06-27 17:11:51 The big oil wants to buy ethanol.  They have been pealing off downstream assets for years.  ethanol is downstream.
3400 2018-06-27 17:11:31 Cheers chef 
3401 2018-06-27 17:11:31 Thanks for reaching out. All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight. Officers are required to notify law enforcement officers if they discover these products while screening your property.
3402 2018-06-27 17:11:27 No. Eventually the oil will run out 
3403 2018-06-27 17:11:18 Yakubu Aigbeni was a proven goal scorer from the time he started with Okomu Oil FC throughout his career.  You can't give what you don't have. I have always seen Ighalo more as a support striker, but I guess he was burdened with the idea of playing him as No 9.
3404 2018-06-27 17:11:16 Step up the sanctions on those giving the mullahs money. Stop Iranian oil flowing.
3405 2018-06-27 17:10:37 Oil. It's like heroine.

3407 2018-06-27 17:10:24 This is great news, the 1 number thing lack of recognition doe  to Somaliland is that it hinders outside investment, the oil exploration finished years ago, yet it cant move ahead, similarly outside investment into infrastructure/industry is difficult because of the legal limbo.

3411 2018-06-27 17:10:06 No it is not, I bought the car brand new and just finished paying it of. I kept up with all my oil changes, premium gas, all to be left with engine problems for a defect which Mercedes is well aware of on this model.

3417 2018-06-27 17:09:53 Hundreds of thousands more acres of pristine public land are going up for auction ONLINE. Help us stop Trump from selling off additional parcels to be exploited for gas and oil exploration. Time is short -- they’re adding more every few months.
3418 2018-06-27 17:09:51 do you know why people don't like to take their cars into for recall work?

3421 2018-06-27 17:09:28 This isn't about peace. It's #Trumps cut of the #Rofsnet $500 Billion oil reserve in the Russian arctic. That's the reason why #Putin put so much into getting @realDonaldTrump elected hoping to get sanctions removed.
3422 2018-06-27 17:09:27 it's probably bc of the oil content ? i use eucalyptus or tea tree oil and it works like a charm
3423 2018-06-27 17:09:20 What happened ? They won’t talk until we stop importing oil from Iran, is it !
3424 2018-06-27 17:09:18 Nothing wrong with that ..Coulda been planned better... He taking 40% of they endorsement IF they get one ... Snake oil salesman if ya ask me ...  hope it work out tho

You know, when if anyone doubts this is your profile, I think the info about salt oil and heat is sort of a giveaway  It made me think of food
3427 2018-06-27 17:08:57 Yeah it definitely did. I think it was Salazar would have actually fought again the oil and gas industry. Had there been a left challenger in the governor’s race, I think they would have polled well and Hick would have endorsed Polis.
3428 2018-06-27 17:08:50 Think heri oil kuliko maji 
3429 2018-06-27 17:08:40 I bet it would only be a matter of “donations” by the veg oil interests to “prove “ you wrong...
3430 2018-06-27 17:08:40 @CNBCFastMoney Question? Why has the price of crude oil /  gone ? In less than 500 days? Trump said we were now energy independent* right? So why are we paying more at the pump if were exporting MORE, I'll bet if you were to check the portfolios of US politicians we'd findout
3431 2018-06-27 17:08:36 Wait PBS with an oil objective will be quite distorted in Z
3432 2018-06-27 17:08:33 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
3433 2018-06-27 17:07:41 yoooo I made my dogs toothpaste out of coconut oil, cinnamon, and probiotic and it’s so much more effective and safe than store bought. ur welcome
3434 2018-06-27 17:07:40 Yes, goods, but the US is mainly a service industry. You have to combine the 2!!! Services and goods. Canada sells oil, electricity and water to the US, that’s why there’s a surplus in good. We sell the electricity dirt cheap to the US, NY depends on that electricity cost!
3435 2018-06-27 17:07:37 Oil prices top $73, hitting highest level since 2014.
3436 2018-06-27 17:07:26 i like their sweet suburban face wash as well it helped clear up my dark spots and controlled the oil!
3437 2018-06-27 17:07:22 I wish all candidates would know what they’re talking about before they go campaigning on a political platform. Those that don’t are pretty much snake oil salesmen. She may figure it out. I hope she does. If not, she is just another politician selling magic beans to rubes.

3439 2018-06-27 17:07:16 How can we put the ownership of Power, Oil & other utilities/resources in the U.S. into the hands of the people, safely & securely, & detach these permanent umbilicals (shackles) from the American people, by us all having a hand in it @elonmusk @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr  ?
3440 2018-06-27 17:07:15 Funny thing is is that there’s a greater empirical basis for this argument than there is for the supply side snake oil they’ve been hawking for years
3441 2018-06-27 17:07:10 Straw man arguments - palm oil is not a food essential. You see more profitability from it that's all. Do a poll, ask if people would rather have, apes that don't go extinct, or palm oil in their cosmetics and cooking their french fries.
3442 2018-06-27 17:07:07 Where Da Oil?
3443 2018-06-27 17:07:03 It is pretty great.  My points discount just hit too, so my last cartridge of weed oil was like $3.
3444 2018-06-27 17:06:55 Question - you believe that higher oil = lower dollar. Is that purely because of inflation effects?
3445 2018-06-27 17:06:42 Just found a Grey Poupon packet in the office kitchen and turned my oil and vinegar into a Dijon vinaigrette #winning #resourceful #smallvictories

3452 2018-06-27 17:06:11 I like to imagine that there’s ludicrously expensive paywalled version of twitter where oil sheikhs retweet Bilderberger slapfights with the caption “I can’t believe this website only costs $50,000/month”
3453 2018-06-27 17:06:06 Sitting at the dealership getting my oil changed and mfs act like they never seen a black woman in they life
3454 2018-06-27 17:06:04 Maybe they ran out of oil
3455 2018-06-27 17:06:01 Almost getting to my inversion call for 2018. However, with oil above $70, that will be really tough. Look for a chance for an inversion from August 31st and on while the Fed hikes into the years end
3456 2018-06-27 17:05:49 Paper Gold down, physical Gold up, risk appetite ok. Trade war doesn't bite US traders due to US domestic up. Matter of time for disillusioned market to burst. We will have pur paper Gold going up. Add - Oil will go down to $50-$60brl range.

3461 2018-06-27 17:05:07 Well, I saw that oil drowns them, and vinegar repels them, so she was bathed in both olive oil & apple cider vinegar. Now she sports the wet look  it’s rather endearing.

3463 2018-06-27 17:04:50 my stepdad works in the oil fields and recently got a raise. the first thing i hear my mom say when my stepdad comes home is “shOW ME THE MONEY!” and then they hugged and started laughing together
3464 2018-06-27 17:04:42 It was hella basic but SO GOOD. All in the blender, 2 avocados, 2 garlic cloves, a lime, a tablespoon of olive oil, salt and pepper and water to thin it out. 
3465 2018-06-27 17:04:42 As I had expressed only recently, action related to sanctioning Iranian crude oil imports or blocking the S-400 system purchase from Russia will really strain US-India ties. And we’ve seen news reports mentioning both today. Definite downswing.
3466 2018-06-27 17:04:36 So will our oil stabilise our Bop soon
3467 2018-06-27 17:04:30 The democrats are against everything American...they’re always bitching about the police, Military, being rich, security, laws, oil , firearms, tabacco, borders, coal , steel, rockets(NASA) tax breaks, the election process and on and on. Trump cheers for America that’s why he won
3468 2018-06-27 17:04:29 MN Dept of Commerce cautions PUC not to open up new pipelines while MN needs to limit oil demand to slow climate change. Cap and trade may be just around the corner! #StopLine3 @MNIPL @HonorTheEarth @MN_350
3469 2018-06-27 17:04:22 Enough to have counted the butter knife stabs it takes to effectively & efficiently get the oil mixed and decide even mixing is the way I want to live my life. Tip: never refrigerate before mixing. Wait... are you creamy or crunchy? I can’t be giving away my tips to a creamy!!@.@
3470 2018-06-27 17:04:19 Any consideration to use our strategic oil reserve to offset the Iran situation and help lower oil prices?

3474 2018-06-27 17:04:03 Thanks! Still learning and trying to get a method for them both down! Know I love doing teeth as: Nuln oil then ushabti bone then a wash of Reikland fleshshade before picking out the tips with white. MY NIDS FLOSS shiny teethies x :DDDD
3475 2018-06-27 17:04:03 I get 4 oil changes for 89.99 ! Don’t need your assistants!  I only go to @Chrysler
3476 2018-06-27 17:04:02 EM & Spx correlation is lost for a while because trade war only marginally affected USA gdp but its effect on EM is very deep .Rising oil price is positively correlated to spx because USA is oil exporter .

3516 2018-06-27 16:59:28 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President:  Would you please explain why the price of a barrel of oil and of a gallon of gas keeps going up and up?  Is that caused by being energy independent or something else?  Sure hope the price of cars doesn't increase by $5,000 because of a trade war.

NDP gov't comes in, forms coalition, passes electoral reform, keeps a close watch on oil companies. Instead we will have entrenched intransigent leftism in BC, if reform passes, which it probably will.
3576 2018-06-27 16:52:16 The oil industry that is directly subsidized by $3B annually and generates $46B in downstream costs is upset that they don't get all the subsidies under the sun and think that a tiny fraction directed at rewables is picking winners!?

3581 2018-06-27 16:51:53 Cryptos are crashing. I think due to higher oil and higher interest rates as cryptos do not pay interest. Many have bought over credit cards and are deep in the red. This hurts the bond market, which hurts than stocks. #OOTT

3622 2018-06-27 16:47:44 What will they achieve by flooding the market with oil?
3623 2018-06-27 16:47:42 Yea that difference was oil, gold opium lithium and much much more.
3624 2018-06-27 16:47:27 $CL_F Did make a new high but RSI divergence has now been erased which means it should be in wave 3 of (3) now #Elliottwave #Oil
3625 2018-06-27 16:47:23 Muslim ban is a misnomer. It also isn’t really about terrorism, as many have commented on. What the extreme left is missing is this is mostly about oil. All the countries banned mean nothing to the US economically. except Iran.  It is about creating a little panic in the markets.
3626 2018-06-27 16:47:20 Ahhhhhh.....the 80s. When the theatre would give you real butter with your popcorn and not this valvolin oil looking crap.
3627 2018-06-27 16:47:07 When the locals are held in jail in the thousands, shady deals made thousands of miles away to extract resources to enrich the same mafia that allowed no rest, rest assured It may not be long before a dozen or so chinese oil workers are killed again.

3630 2018-06-27 16:46:57 I’ll answer now I’m not driving home from work. 
Yes I want an independent Scotland, but one  that isn’t tied to the EU, a Scotland that truly can stand on its own, until then we’re much better of in the UK. Oil is too volatile a commodity to peg to an economy

3632 2018-06-27 16:46:44 2023 New New California breaks from Wokistan official economic policy to price oil imports in petrofacecoins
3633 2018-06-27 16:46:39 He stated clearly this was his "belief" ie a hypothesis to be examined.  Historical facts (Enbridge saga, BNSF oil shipping profits, Keystone, Altalink ) included match what's publicly known.  Serves as basis for predicting potential future developments.
3634 2018-06-27 16:46:35 When Nigeria wanted to break up before, when the northern part said they want to go, It was then that the British revealed to them the barrels of oil that is been produced and convinced them not to go so that they will continue to steal the oil and gas and other resources.

3640 2018-06-27 16:46:09 Food for thought: Imagine what these oil exports mean to the US trade deficit.. 3mm bpd at $70 oil equates to  $75.65B pouring into the US, if u believe EPD’s 4mm estimate by 2022 at $70 oil that equates to $102.2B.. At $100 oil those #s go to $109.5B & $146B respectively.. #OOTT

3643 2018-06-27 16:45:56 That's a difficult comparison --- a central bank to an oil cartel, mate. SNB was a literal and devastating revaluation maneuver. OPEC is a known quantity with a protectionist, predictable bias. Oil is traded, sovereign currencies are integrated into the deep global infrastructure

3714 2018-06-27 16:37:00 Largest source of personal debt in U.S. right now is car loans, so not sure where you're going with this. If we ban cars & re-invest, like, half the money in transit/housing, the cost of living goes down, not up. And cars use 90% of oil, so, yes, reducing driving reduces oil use.

3718 2018-06-27 16:36:42 The problem I see is that powerful nations such as the USA, UK, Russia, etc have been ‘installing” or supporting corrupt governments all over the world and causing/supporting economically driven wars/conflicts (i.e. oil). Some of THAT leads to migrant crises.

3724 2018-06-27 16:36:30 One of the OIL arguments that has trickled down to the indy twitter feeds is that oil companies need to be subsidised, and thats why in a down turn they pay less tax.

Of course like most of the replies its shite, Norway oil disproves it easy- and argues for nationalization too.

3755 2018-06-27 16:32:10 Anybody else get nervous when they take their car in for a basic service i.e. an oil change when they’ve been putting it off for a min?
3756 2018-06-27 16:32:08 My son works in the oil industry and he is a first class Power Engineer and a Mechanical Engineer and works in management now and he says shipping to the States is costing Canada billions and we need the pipeline to the west coast so we can market our own oil
3757 2018-06-27 16:32:02 They get sponsored by the oil Arabs other company it's a loophole I believe everyone's being conned
3758 2018-06-27 16:31:57 I think we all need a bit of dowsing down, Lorraine  .. brilliant ain't it   It's a pity we can't bottle some of it for the coul wintry days  .. save the oil bill   
3759 2018-06-27 16:31:53 Very strong demand from industry and the freight transport sector for distillate fuels (principally diesel fuel oil but also jet)
3760 2018-06-27 16:31:49 Pake face oil kleveru coba sama maskeran beautetox
3761 2018-06-27 16:31:36 As @elerianm puts it, the trifecta of rising interest rates, high oil prices and higher USD is detrimental to emerging markets. Today is an excellent example. Every USD1 change in the price of crude, impacts Egypt's budget by EGP 10 billion. Biggest single factor after FX rate.
3762 2018-06-27 16:31:35 No he ran on total nationalisation of Venezuela Petrochemical Sector. Also subsidized Oil exports to non oil producing countries.
3763 2018-06-27 16:31:33 He's going to have to head to Oil Changers for a hair oil change.
3764 2018-06-27 16:31:31 oh you wrote Cascara ..I read Castor Oil for some...never mind...
3765 2018-06-27 16:31:23 Trail mix and braces are like oil and water ugh
3766 2018-06-27 16:31:22 I made an appointment to get my oil changed this morning just in case you thought being in LA was all fun and games
3767 2018-06-27 16:31:16 Depends on how quickly your hair dries. You shouldn't need to use it everyday.

Apply it and when it doesn't feel wet to the touch apply a little olive oil.
3768 2018-06-27 16:31:11 coconut oil is meant for everything idc

3770 2018-06-27 16:31:03 they just get too crazy at times. yeah i agree when he put the baby oil on for the first time all his stans nut themselves
3771 2018-06-27 16:31:03 Same! I know salad is sensible option but doesn’t hit the spot! I had a nice light spaghetti with garlic, olive oil and butternut squash which hit the spot last night though
3772 2018-06-27 16:30:57 For lunch gabe made me 2 avocado sandwiches with spinach, kale, garlic salt, and cashew cheese on a vegan rosemary bun drizzled with olive oil and i am still thinking about them
3773 2018-06-27 16:30:31 #Alberta is the largest oil & natural gas producer in Canada.

3775 2018-06-27 16:30:23 Complex subject...oil imports will make calculations haywire in election year
3776 2018-06-27 16:30:22 #Breaking | #America, #UnitedKingdom, #France, #Italy have issued a statement confirming that the energy resources in #Libya must remain under exclusive control of the legitimate Oil foundation
3777 2018-06-27 16:30:17 Komugi is so slimy they're DRIPPING in oil
3778 2018-06-27 16:30:07 So why do u think banning gas cars is woke? I think it has to make sense economically or people will avoid those municipalities due to cost of living, and global oil consumption wont budge due to supply/demand.
3779 2018-06-27 16:29:59 Oil moves on own terms - DOE (today), supply concerns (Iran, etc.)
3780 2018-06-27 16:29:57 Why did successive westminster goverments keep the 1974 McCrone report on Scotlands oil secret until it was discovered by FOI by Mp. Why did Tony Blair give Scottish waters to England which contained,oil wells if it belonged to the UK.
3781 2018-06-27 16:29:49 Amazing hard work @school_ws I loved your rainforest and so much information about palm oil. You all should be very proud of yourselves and your dedicated teachers 
3782 2018-06-27 16:29:46 Dah one dah needs break oil in his brain, d one dere before is black already.
3783 2018-06-27 16:29:36 Better snake oil salesman.
3784 2018-06-27 16:29:35 @5W30_OIL お誕生日ですか！！おめでとうございますー！！！
素敵な一年を過ごしてください！(*0ω0从*) たまにチラチラ枠行ってるので今度は潜らないでコメントしますね(*´艸`)
3785 2018-06-27 16:29:21 @PMOIndia Sir, Please Correct Your Country From Buying Iran Oil.. Any Money To Iran Now Will Support 'Weak' Regime That Street Protesters Are Threatening Govt Overthrow.. A Needed Change For MidEast... DoG
3786 2018-06-27 16:29:12 yalllll coconut oil does WONDERS for your hair
3787 2018-06-27 16:29:02 No but I used to buy it because Panda girls actually likes it. It’s the only oil I don’t have to trick her into taking or shove down her throat. Now I’m back tricking her and shoving down her throat but it’s ok cuz treatibles does not treat kids kindly or compassionately
3788 2018-06-27 16:28:58 Be happy you're not trying to being a NSNG vegetarian who has an aversion to eggs, nuts, avocados, and putting oil in your coffee gets old pretty quick.
3789 2018-06-27 16:28:55 I've been using a face oil recently at night time and it has made my skin sooooo happy. I have oily/combination skin and it always seems counterintuitive to put MORE oil on but that's your skin overproducing oil usually. So if you hydrate it properly it CALMS TF DOWN.
3790 2018-06-27 16:28:55 Y'all I literally spend my night doing a painting using oil pastel for the first time in my life and I'm really satisfied with the result. I can't even imagine I can paint that because I sucks at drawing or whatsoever about arts 
3791 2018-06-27 16:28:53 That's because Venezuela has the audacity to be sitting on top of Rex Tillerson's oil reserves.
3792 2018-06-27 16:28:48 So the issue is that CBD oil in its present legality isn’t effective in treating the broad spectrum of conditions that the marijuana plant is capable of treating under the newly passed 788 bill?
3793 2018-06-27 16:28:37 Start with expedited construction for oil storage facilities so that we have adequate stock of petroleum and can hold out for some time.. then have serious dialogue with China for import of petroleum.. yes easier said than done but we can try.. long term is moving away from oil
3794 2018-06-27 16:28:34 When I see white kitchens I just imagine all that stew and that oil splashing from the stew pot
3795 2018-06-27 16:28:26 Oil not even 30, and the man look like he been 45 for 4 years now. But that’s my guy.
3796 2018-06-27 16:28:21 Hada labo oil tu apa eh
3797 2018-06-27 16:28:20 Coco oil pull...
3798 2018-06-27 16:28:17 people got that oil money to spend
3799 2018-06-27 16:28:16 I Need Some Brakes And Ah oil Change
3800 2018-06-27 16:28:07 I hope the initiative for non fossil bassed vehicles in india will go in a systematic and phased manner to reduce oil dependance
3801 2018-06-27 16:27:58 Forests are also felled and habitats destroyed to make way for fields of hungry cattle and to produce fodder for them overwinter and everybody still eats meat. But mention palm oil and everyone loses their minds. #hypocricy #savetheplanet #goveggie
3802 2018-06-27 16:27:55 Buat skin care Cia pake natrep aloe aja sih, nah make upnya pake foundie maybelline yang fitme matte sama compactnya, atau pake cushionnya yang matte juga, terus siap sedia oil control filmnya clean and clear buat ngikis minyak yang berlebih :(
3803 2018-06-27 16:27:54 No I don't believe there ever were threats of sanctions from the US issued to every country in the world re stopping the use of Iranian oil by November. trump is not a king + doesn't have the right to bully my country, Canada or any country for that matter.
3804 2018-06-27 16:27:54 I'm on your side re TM. I think that it's disingenuous of you to use an IEEFA report to bash the government. IEEFA is a shill for the oil and mining industry. I would take anything they say regarding a left-leaning government decision with a peck of salt. The maths don't add up.
3805 2018-06-27 16:27:51 Gatwe mochine o nokile,  o ne o sa thelwa oil?
3806 2018-06-27 16:27:50 Wtf! Hahaha what are you talking about? Sis natural danlog gid ang oil. Gaga ka bala hahahahahahah
3807 2018-06-27 16:27:45 S'INFIAMMA L'OIL  
3808 2018-06-27 16:27:33 Panadol is snake oil; fight me.
3809 2018-06-27 16:27:25 $EURUSD breaks below 1.1600 to new weekly lows. Stubborn $USDCAD sticking to the range. $WTI #Crude #oil prices print 2018 tops near $73.00 on EIA. $EURJPY trims daily losses, remains in a range.
3810 2018-06-27 16:27:16 - Bb cream purbasari
- Oil control matte powder purbasari
-Lipcream purbasari shade azalea (ini bagus banget sumpah, lo makan seganas apapun lipcreamnya memang ilang, tapi dia ninggalin bekas pink gitu kayak kita abis pake liptint)
- Beauty creations/inez/sari ayu
- Viva
3811 2018-06-27 16:27:15 So where are the "Oil is the most crowded long ever" people? Vicious move off the 63.5 o/n low last week.
3812 2018-06-27 16:27:14 It would not be a wise idea to watch the #WorldCup18 if you are prone to heart attacks. This shit's as bad for your heart as drinking a gallon of uncooked oil. #MEXSWE
3813 2018-06-27 16:27:09 Lot of paper oil bulls out there. Meanwhile US net oil Imports below 1.9mmbpd and in my view accelerating lower. 
The rest is risk off.
3814 2018-06-27 16:27:05 Harley is overpriced junk...it has been way Too long for a better american bike to come along,with superior quality in comparison to asian bikes. Harley riders must become mechanics. Oil change only on asian bikes
3815 2018-06-27 16:27:04 Hiyo German machine iliwekwa maji badala ya oil #KORGER
3816 2018-06-27 16:26:59 Not sure about all reasoning in the past but looking at it today the one obvious difference between Northern Ireland and Scotland? Oil
3817 2018-06-27 16:26:59 Oil Pulling is probably bullshit, but here I am doing the grossest thing ever
3818 2018-06-27 16:26:58 Big oil doesn’t hate ethanol. They hate they can’t control it and run ramshot with it like they do everything else. They would love to bankrupt ethanol.  Buy em out. Rename it the new green fuel. Crack shitty gas. Bump it in quality with ethanol. And charge a premium.
3819 2018-06-27 16:26:53 I have turned into my mother sunbathing in the garden with factor 6 oil on 
3820 2018-06-27 16:26:51 Unlike the Obama Admin. Which allowed other countries to gradually reduce their oil purchases from #Iran , Trump Admin wants them to cut their purchases to zero in one stage-ironically on November 4th, the 39th anniversary of the storming of US embassy in Tehran.
3821 2018-06-27 16:26:39 Kicking up my coffee game today. I did the CBD oil in there for a couple days but I decided it seems like the oil sticks to the sides of the cup. I don’t like wasting.  but rather than regular butter I got the Ghee. Yummy!
3822 2018-06-27 16:26:23 US needs their oil. Why should the US dictate to other nations? By what right can they do this? Would the US allow EU to tell them they cannot produce coal? No. Get beyond your nationalist world view. If US wants to refuse OPEC+ oil, so be it, do so. US economy will then collapse
3823 2018-06-27 16:26:20 And using a bottle cap with a lil bit off praying oil in it 
3824 2018-06-27 16:26:18 Lipbalm, bright eyes oil paling bagus
3825 2018-06-27 16:26:09 This weeks menu:
Specialty Pizzas- Crispy Kale, Onion & Sausage or Caprese- Tomato, Opal Basil, Fresh Mozz & Balsamic Glaze

Pasta Special- Homemade Linguine with Garlic & Olive Oil
3826 2018-06-27 16:26:08 I would share this recipe if you eliminate the olive oil, rewrite using water frying. Only sharing oil free recipes @rivkafreeman
3827 2018-06-27 16:26:02 Rig can move quickly.....oil runs a  day or two above 75.  Numbers show breakout above 13.50...
3828 2018-06-27 16:25:29 IMO.Russian military aggression & Annexation by force of sovereign Ukrainian Territory & Provence of Crimea for Oil & Gas reserves & strategic position.Russian war in & on East Ukrainian Territory for Huge coal reserves & coal mines,steel works,industrial complex.
3829 2018-06-27 16:25:27 You answered your own question. Venezuela is the country with the largest oil reserves, but its people are starving and dying because of lack of medicines. Isn’t these enough reasons to want a change of regime?
3830 2018-06-27 16:25:13 my cam room is probably going to smell like baby oil for a long time but I had a great time on cam today! Thanks everyone for an awesome show!
3831 2018-06-27 16:25:12 I smell like cocoa butter, lemons and coconut oil lmao
3832 2018-06-27 16:25:08 Why does this news tidbit make $80 a barrel oil sound like a good thing?
3833 2018-06-27 16:25:02 แชมป์เก่าไปซะละ555
3834 2018-06-27 16:24:56 "Home-made tomato sauce".
Absolutely home made, as commercial sauces (a.k.a ketchup) are full of sugar (processed, industrial wastes, etc). They are more harmful than being useful. I cook fresh tomato with olive oil, add salt, pepper, and some fresh lemon juice. Avoid ketchup!
3835 2018-06-27 16:24:56 Double cleansing tu first guna oil. Then cuci kali kedua guna pencuci muka yg you biasa guna 
3836 2018-06-27 16:24:43 It's both, NG & crude oil. The ng will be piped to djubuti after completion of z pipe. And the crude oil will be sold to cement facories in the country as they use it as an input. Only 450 bpd prdn to start with. No refinery needed. Not fishy.
3837 2018-06-27 16:24:42 madadaanan mo yon pagnagmc arthur highway ka, lagpas ng potrero konti. Sa branch sya ng sea oil sa malabon.
3838 2018-06-27 16:24:35 Organ. You would want an edible, oil, or pill form
3839 2018-06-27 16:24:28 All I want for my birthday is a real good home cooked meal steak salmon mashed potatoes butter broccoli and some great sex fully oil and in lingerie I wonder will I get that
3840 2018-06-27 16:24:21 Really strange market action today  

Oil is up big, but

-EM equity is down 1% (also odd SPX+)
-Treasury yields are down (even BEI)
-Dollar is up (even vs the Ruble)

Oil short covering? I'm baffled
3841 2018-06-27 16:24:13 Since when does It take 3 hours to get an oil change.. wtf
3842 2018-06-27 16:24:07 First Japan, now South Korea. May write for a German news service but as an Asian resident much excited by this World Cup. Add oil!
3843 2018-06-27 16:24:06 Risk on oil trades were the order of the day on the UK 250, with Tullow Oil and Premier Oil leading the charge, up 8% and 7.8% respectively
3844 2018-06-27 16:23:59 Nigeria -- that's were this happens, and that's where Mike Hudema and Greenpeace would rather the world's oil supply come from, instead of Canada.

Hey Mikey, why don't you go to Nigeria and try your shenanigans there, and see what happens? #HudemaLies
3845 2018-06-27 16:23:46 I do! 2L a day keeps the kidney stones at bay. The coco water hydration and vitamins is for my skin and hair lol. Coconut oil is too hydrating and makes it me a grease ball but it was also the most hydrated it’s ever been so coco water is a step down
3846 2018-06-27 16:23:45 As a big fan of sesame and sesame oil, I am appalled at being associated with Rosmah.
3847 2018-06-27 16:23:44 Lmaooo well @sophiemulloy covered herself in oil so I think she’s a bigger idiot than me though 
3848 2018-06-27 16:23:43 Elections and devotionals. Tomorrow's Oil and water.
3849 2018-06-27 16:23:37 The stoppers given by @CannTrust for their oil (a) have a giant hole in them + (b) are loose enough that they keep falling into the bottle and I cannot get them out. There are now two stoppers in my bottle. Please, @CannTrust, fix this crap - it doesn't happen with other LPs.
3850 2018-06-27 16:23:20 Oil your own machine
3851 2018-06-27 16:23:19 If I could give the whole world a coke, I wouldn't, because a solid, carbon-rich residue derived from distillation of crude oil is not a good gift.
3852 2018-06-27 16:23:19 well I have spices and salad :3 I like that too with oil and some bread it’s rlly good :3
3853 2018-06-27 16:23:01 yo that tea tree oil performed miracles on my face
3854 2018-06-27 16:22:57 That is a beautiful tablecloth. 
So, is the government merely trying to wait out the protesters? 
No movement either way. 
Any idea on exchange rate for $1USD = ?rials
Any effect of USA/Iran oil sanction?
Now sanction on rugs/iran food.
3855 2018-06-27 16:22:55 My car said oil change in 1500km mina I went to BP and asked them to pour oil Told my person he just booked my car in nje, saying he’ll take it in tomorrow argh it’s the little things hey
3856 2018-06-27 16:22:49 Every nation has the right to manage their econ. Each member nation is stating how much oil can be prod from their land. No different than a nation requiring a prod to have a permit. Is that interference to free mkt? It is "their" oil. US could refuse to buy it, on principle.
3857 2018-06-27 16:22:37 CBD OIL WORKS
3858 2018-06-27 16:22:37 Bülent Ecevit sesiyle okudum. Fuel Oil yazmamışsın

3860 2018-06-27 16:22:24 The Edmonton Oil Kings hire Kirt Hill as team president and GM. Brad Lauer has been named head coach. #OilKings
3861 2018-06-27 16:22:23 So the chemical needed to provide treatment to that person isn’t able to be put in an oil / pill / edible ? 
Only effective if smoked?
3862 2018-06-27 16:22:16 Oil diplomacy is not simple
3863 2018-06-27 16:22:14 "I wanna take my five fingers, apply olive oil on them and wanna do service to you"
3864 2018-06-27 16:22:11 B/c overborrowing while the country was raking in huge oil profits isn't magically socialist? The more they replicated the US' economic model of fiat currency, the more the economy went into collapse. Companies refusing to produce create artificial shortage so they can drive up $
3865 2018-06-27 16:22:04 hibo.. use it to replace cooking oil, you can use it for your face, body , and afro. you can oil pull with it  too
3866 2018-06-27 16:21:55 眠ると朝になってしまう恐怖
3867 2018-06-27 16:21:49 @danahull the entire Tesla dilemma is quite irrelevant in that the hydrogen fleet now quietly developing around the world will blow e-card to kingdom come in the next 10 years. Massive impact on oil industry also avoids soaring power costs
3868 2018-06-27 16:21:43 Starting off my day with organic popcorn doused with coconut oil and  Pink Himalayan salt. Changing my middle name to Los Angeles.
3869 2018-06-27 16:21:39 U.S. crude oil exports hit 
a record high :)
3870 2018-06-27 16:21:35 i wish 1 truck of corn = five trucks.  more like 35% a truck of ethanol, 28.5% of ddgs truck (or 51% of a modified truck), 2.2% of a corn oil truck and 30% of a CO2 truck.  

your point is well take though.  the value of corn is in its parts.
3871 2018-06-27 16:21:34 Oil changed, renewed CAA, big ass jack purchased. Transportation is ready for the trip!
3872 2018-06-27 16:21:34 Mumtaz and mamathi, vaishnavi correct in their point... These guys fail to make it smooth and irritating by pouring oil into fire...
3873 2018-06-27 16:21:26 omg i used the bumble and bumble cleansing oil cream duo & my hair feels so nice 
goodbye crusty hair days 
3874 2018-06-27 16:21:15 If you can afford it, Macadamia Nut Oil goes a long way & doesn't leave your skin at all greasy. It is a very, very fine oil, so it soaks in really well. Coconut Oil is good too. While you're at it, take the oil orally by pouring some over your steamed veges or salad.
3875 2018-06-27 16:21:10 Wait, so oil goes up under Democrat admin and, its said it’s bc the economy is thriving and more oil is being consumed “ but now... not ? Mmmmmkayyy.
3876 2018-06-27 16:21:08 Large US #oil inventory reduction in today’s report but price exploded yesterday. Government report is being leaked to #wallstreet insiders. @cnnmoney
3877 2018-06-27 16:21:08 I’m one of the only people I know that drinks their coffee black....no cream no sugar....straight oil 
3878 2018-06-27 16:20:59 $OIL en maximos de casi 4 años, es tuya $PBR querida!!! $APBR.
3879 2018-06-27 16:20:57 Dirty oil. Them for take come suame
3880 2018-06-27 16:20:57 Do you in all honesty expect them to say otherwise, following the outcry and condemnation from all over? It will be totally naive and insensitive to take this murderous group serious. Don't give oil for evil to thrive. It could be you or a loved one next.
3881 2018-06-27 16:20:39 Picked up a packet of @Tyrrells lightly salted crisps with “best ever recipe” emblazoned on it. Best ever recipe?! The ingredients are potatoes, sunflower oil and sea salt. How do you improve on that?
3882 2018-06-27 16:20:25 .@dpcarrington @JustinGosling @IUCN ... Canada ban products with palm oil. Save the oranguatang. Urgent. @CPHO_Canada @DFriesenGlobal
3883 2018-06-27 16:20:25 Aw damn I got my lavender oil in my eye
3884 2018-06-27 16:20:14 I'm sure they invented waterproofing oil. Don't know though if they have to rub themselves with it, drink it or inject it.
3885 2018-06-27 16:20:11 @zackmirons why is my son KP hanging out with that snake oil salesman Larry Sanders
3886 2018-06-27 16:19:54 my conspiracy, my opinion: oil prices dropped once the US realized that latin american countries were taking advantage to create peaceful, prosperous socialist governments.

Oil Filter Cross Reference
A great reference for finding that next oil filter, also see the other oil filter link for more info!
3891 2018-06-27 16:19:14 Why all the 'Oil is running oot' and 'job losses' mantra from the MSM and successive UKgovs then.
3892 2018-06-27 16:19:12 @Go_CheshireWest Can you expplain why your bin collectors have refused to collect waste oil as they are supposed to according to your website? @LGOmbudsman

3895 2018-06-27 16:19:02 But I still won't agree that Sane needed to be in the national team. This dude acting like he's bigger than the team just because he's earning that oil money in City
3896 2018-06-27 16:18:55 OiIwa?? Oil wa?? ???? what is that?
3897 2018-06-27 16:18:54 So trillions in quantitative easing, wars, oil subsidies, the list goes on, but we can’t afford programs to help people’s basic needs? Got it.
3898 2018-06-27 16:18:47 i was supposed to get an oil change and emissions test before work but i’m just gonna go back to sleep instead

3902 2018-06-27 16:18:27 You're making it impossible with all this tariff crap. You do see the affect you're having on oil prices correct?
3903 2018-06-27 16:18:22 Getting the oil changed in one of the cars and realized there no way to get this 3 hours of my life back! #whattakessolong #WednesdayWisdom #truth
3904 2018-06-27 16:18:15 Sounds like a lie.

Anti-Nato is when NATO members skimp on their defense funding.

Anti-russia is arming Ukraine And Poland.  

Trump is hitting both from the right perspective & it's entirely anti-putin.

The greatest anti-putin thing Trump is doing is keeping oil price low
3905 2018-06-27 16:18:14 Do we really need to rewatch all the videos of Sean Penn and Michael Moore ball wash Hugo Chavez before he decimated an oil rich country on how their vison never works
3906 2018-06-27 16:18:12 Crude oil having some
3907 2018-06-27 16:18:05 Oil prices are up today, Don Jr.'s hair value went up $2.49 in morning trade.
3908 2018-06-27 16:17:59 I don’t care what you’ve researched or who you’ve talked to told you I am NOT going to buy $70 for  bottle of CBD oil.

3912 2018-06-27 16:17:48 The German machine needs to check it's oil
3913 2018-06-27 16:17:46 I haven't tried it by the way, it just seems to be of potential absorbent use, it might catch on hopefully. Wood sawdust can be used or some sort of proprietary oil soak is common though.
3914 2018-06-27 16:17:41 寝て　はい
3915 2018-06-27 16:17:34 ほうらいさんのお題に凸したいんだけどくんとがみたいしかいわないからほんとうにだめ…
3916 2018-06-27 16:17:18 おっ
3917 2018-06-27 16:17:18 Ok, The company said there is a prospect to find commercial quantity oil , now just testing stage, sample extracted.
3918 2018-06-27 16:17:01 Great for you. Two thing that make it work: North sea oil revenues represents 22% of your GNP and a population of 5.3 million. What's working against you as well as other developing countries is an aging population and dropping birth rate which translate into higher social costs.
3919 2018-06-27 16:16:50 Yes! Literally pick a favorite protein, a flattering cheese, and a bright vegetable or two and throw it on top of the lettuce. Drown in dressing (red wine vinaigrette or oil&vinegar are my favs [and the “healthiest” options]). Serve with crackers. 
3920 2018-06-27 16:16:43 Hey your DMs aren’t open but I was wondering if you’d be willing/interested in coming on @IntoTheWildHS to discuss Oil Rogue? I’d love to get your take on it. Open invite. Please let me know!
3921 2018-06-27 16:16:42 I had some friends in the oil business. They tell me they control the prices by whether they pump and how much.
3922 2018-06-27 16:16:40 Oh actually just remembered that real duct tape is way worse, properly awful. Spraying oil onto the hair helps a bit if it happens to you again, it helps you peel the tape off the hair.
3923 2018-06-27 16:16:34 参加しまーす(.ﾟーﾟ)
3924 2018-06-27 16:16:29 Reacting to #Trump's order to allies to stop buying #Iran's oil, an oil Ministry official says it's just an extravagant claim bcz it's almost impossible to omit 2.5 million bpd of Iranin crude, LNG from global market.
3925 2018-06-27 16:16:27 Atlantians are brainwashing us with 1 dollar bills to blow up offshore oil rigs.  #GMOs
3926 2018-06-27 16:16:19 And yet a whole crew of people can spill hundreds of gallons of oil into the ocean and we just keep pretending nothing happened.
3927 2018-06-27 16:16:08 Neuer quel con 
3928 2018-06-27 16:16:03 india too to face secondary sanctions from USA for importing oil from Iran ..being the Third largest supplier Iran holds a key position regardin oil import...
U call CPEC an attack on soverignity ....What is this???
3929 2018-06-27 16:15:53 Moisture on the oil tank
3930 2018-06-27 16:15:53 Totally unsubstantiated assertion. the US refineries for ideological reasons, under US Govt instructions refused to process soviet oil. They were confiscated. US gov doesn´t accept dialogue, wants to impose, Believe me, for 60 years its has failed, it will fail
3931 2018-06-27 16:15:48 There's the sovereign state legal immunity point mentioned by others and there is also the fact that inbuilt boom and bust cycles in the oil industry are larger than for other industries and not desirable for the economy so you could say they have been tolerated due to that #OOTT
3932 2018-06-27 16:15:46 Stir together 4 1/2 tbsps carrots with 1/3 cup broccoli. Add generous amounts of Olive Oil. Boil. Serve to your worst enemy.
3933 2018-06-27 16:15:46 The Ferguson Shipyard on the lower Clyde is being loaned 30 million pounds by the Scottish government. The loan's intended to help the shipyard diversify its work, to win contracts to repair and service ships, and decommission oil platforms.
3934 2018-06-27 16:15:45 It’s official!! The Grand Opening of our Scrubway Wash and Lube is done!

3936 2018-06-27 16:15:39 somebody please bring me some castor oil my hair screaming
3937 2018-06-27 16:15:36 #3. This ignores that the oil companies will just pass the tax on to the consumers. So this is redistribution, nothing else.
3938 2018-06-27 16:15:29 አዎ! Refinery ባይኖረንም crude oil አልን! ምን ለማለት ነው፣ ባናሸንፍም በአብይ አሸንፈናል  ሸር አታናግሪኝ...ኳሱ ነው!

3942 2018-06-27 16:15:16 Mr. Olive oil!
If you belive in democracy, you should respect people's choices  even they had changed their own choices. Like most of people have gave up your party.(-%6,76)
Secondly, you need to show your evidence and to prove your arguments about relation with Feto.
3943 2018-06-27 16:15:15 I’m sure they’re all doing it out of the love of dirty oil and not their love of dirty money.
3944 2018-06-27 16:14:51 Ive literally been tanning with baby oil on everyday and I still havent got a patch darkernot even burned a tad
3945 2018-06-27 16:14:50 Reliance is one of the clients of GE Oil&Gas. Need to see how this will impact them.
3946 2018-06-27 16:14:30 I love getting my face waxed, but I hate the oil they put on it after bc I always break out from it 
3947 2018-06-27 16:14:19 I feel like a goddamn princess every time I order groceries online but I'm also vv thrifty  & $3 virgin unprocessed coconut oil is a BARGAIN

3950 2018-06-27 16:14:06 situation in Venezuela is worse because of mismanagement. Oil keeps money flowing, and government let it collapse
3951 2018-06-27 16:14:05 1 corn truck goes in..... And 5 different trucks haul out...1 wet feed truck, 1 dry feed truck, 1 ethanol truck, 1 corn oil truck, and 1 CO2 truck.  All from that little kernel of corn.

3953 2018-06-27 16:13:36 My car officially hit 20,020 miles. My car was due for an oil change over 2,000 miles ago... at 18,371 miles to be exact. I seriously need to change the oil lol
3954 2018-06-27 16:13:33 Hmm interesting so you won’t produce any oil all day ?
3955 2018-06-27 16:13:22 Cleatus the joyless mind if you're into electronic music without being a joke which completely encapsulates an oil change
3956 2018-06-27 16:13:22 Interesting...shows how important it is for teams w/ superstar players to ensure they don't overpay parts that would probably be nowhere near as good in a different setting.
3957 2018-06-27 16:13:08 Saudi should be on the list. But they won't because money and oil and all....
3958 2018-06-27 16:13:02 Tip of the day: Trim the excess fat from the meat before cooking it to lower the calories and use olive oil for cooking

3960 2018-06-27 16:12:51 Great chart.  I drive in CT and it costs me $50 a month now in electricity per month instead of $275 in gas.  There are many factors, but the raw variable costs are so much less to drive EV.  No oil changes. Likely no brake changes.  No emissions tests.  No fuel filter changes...
3961 2018-06-27 16:12:50 I dont think India will stop buying oil from Iran. Infact Iran has told India that India can buy using India's currency thus no sanctions can be put 
3962 2018-06-27 16:12:49 You are in luck, you want someone to oil you up 
3963 2018-06-27 16:12:44 really distressing scenes on the moorland in tameside... it’s a shame we can’t make the oil spill response 727s based at DSA to dump instead of spray

3972 2018-06-27 16:12:05 @atahasnain53 sir would it be right for India to listen to US and cut its oil demand from Iran... It could be a great loss for India as Iran is already giving us a lot of concessions and also there are other reasons as well...

3978 2018-06-27 16:11:12 Most crises like this result from a variety of factors coming together.

In this case, it appears to be the end result of absolutely catastrophic government policy.

Granted, the decline in oil prices in 2014 hit hard, but Russia, Saudi, Azerbaijan, etc. struggled, didn't crash.

3980 2018-06-27 16:11:09 Los contratos son de largo plazo... la política energética ya incorpora en el Plan Nacional, el sustituir la E termo por E alternativas, eso se está dando gradual/. Y las reservas de Oil no son para más de 7 años, así que la transición la tendría que hacer cualquiera.

3983 2018-06-27 16:10:43 Agreed! I expect this regulation may be relaxed with the introduction of other derivative products in the near future. Vaping 3% THC oil would not be very enjoyable.

4007 2018-06-27 16:09:14 Glad we locked in our clients when Oil was mid range $60 - WTI just hit $73 and Brent back to $78. Use an energy consultancy that trades that way you have an eye on the market every single day!

4021 2018-06-27 16:07:46 .@BluMaan I like using sea salt spray as a pre-styler to add texture and volume. What do you think about using it in conjunction with Argan oil to keep my hair healthy? Is there something else you would suggest?
4022 2018-06-27 16:07:38 I definitely will. Paisley is scared of everything not just fireworks. I will probably be looking into the lavender oil soon so I’ll let you know on both of those.
4023 2018-06-27 16:07:27 Someday the cycle will turn and we'll have a recession, probably helped along by $70+ oil. Ford might not look too smart then.
4024 2018-06-27 16:07:16 This is unusual what's going on - hardest bit for oil traders is the US statements not seeming to have a plan as I said - or a blind disregard on the effect it has on markets - why I keep mentioning Iran after hammering on OPEC - that sort of thing kills credibility with traders

4037 2018-06-27 16:05:58 Yep. They say " a picture says a thousand words." If I were to reproduce an artwork of this photo, it would be a teletype of an oil painting. :D Still practicing my delivery of humour. Thanks.
4038 2018-06-27 16:05:52 Democrats are not controlling gas prices. The current administration want OPEC to pump more, but want to block all of IRANs production.  The current demand cannot keep up with this lack of supply.. thus Oil hit a new 3 year high today.. thus, watch for higher pump $ coming

4041 2018-06-27 16:05:40 Do you think there is also a possibility for crude oil to rise in value significantly in the intermediate term. It seems there is strong momentum. Perhaps hitting stop losses before a retracement?

4065 2018-06-27 16:04:07 The post is about lack of pipeline capacity, its effects on the price we obtain for oil. On more pipeline capacity: from what NEB approved, Harper govt approved 5, 4 were built before 2015 elexn. Trudeau has nixed 2; spooked, then bought a 60 yr old pipeline; yet to build 1 new.

4116 2018-06-27 16:00:09 Interesting premise. That operates under the assumption that oil has a lot of upside from here. So much so that it offsets the waiting time, more efficient trucks, and brand loyalty. Consumer break habits when daily costs break banks.

4266 2018-06-27 15:48:24 I think the point is that exactly - they'll only plant other trees that are even worse, if they stop planting for palm oil. There's  zero regard for the environment. I boycott palm oil but this makes me question our oil consumption overall.
4267 2018-06-27 15:48:17 Investment by foreign oil and gas is down with Canadian oil and gas companies picking up the slack.  The majority of industry is seeing an increase in foreign $$.  Employment figures in Canada are strong.  What's with the "Canada is doomed" narrative?  Cdn's aren't idiots.

4269 2018-06-27 15:48:05 Yes I agree that Scotland should get 100% revenue, but only as an independent country, which thankfully it’s not, it’s part of the UK and looks likely to remain so indefinitely

1) what would you rely on if oil price crashed? Or 
2) Ran Out
4270 2018-06-27 15:48:02 Yes, am also conflicted for the same reason as you. It seemed right to prescribe Billy Caldwell cannabis oil last week, but the principle of licensing drugs on the basis of evidence has to be upheld.

Trump&Team: You help me become president, forgive all Russian held debt of mine and team.. I lift sanctions, open up oil reserves, etc.. we'll make billions..

Putin&Team: OK..

Simple.. 

Trump is, quite simply, a selfish grifter...

4342 2018-06-27 15:40:41 Not saying it is the bottom but this comment comes to mind at what was the peak of the oil boom in the early 80's....  Bob Farrell: "you don't have standing room only at the bottom"

4347 2018-06-27 15:40:16 Ok...I'll hold it for a little longer, but I can certainly identify with frustrated shareholders, because CPG stock doesn't move that well. Oil is pushing up today with large draw. We have walked by each other in downtown Toronto.

4354 2018-06-27 15:39:51 I like how they put olive oil on your table here like it’s ketchup lol
4355 2018-06-27 15:39:45 I agree! News flash, you can’t just go to Muslim countries illegally, and they have oil money! For Mexico, why don’t we hold them accountable to control the cartels? Instead of giving the cartels more ground and power?

4357 2018-06-27 15:39:35 2/2 I tend to knee-jerk "likes" toward anything that sheds a negative light on essential oil MLMs like doTerra, mainly because they blatantly lie about their products and people fall for it.

4363 2018-06-27 15:39:18 As you know, much palm oil is simply used to fry things in. Decimate wildlife because it's better to fry in than rape or sunflower oil? Or because it's in luxury goods like chocolate, or cosmetics? There are alternatives that would do much less harm.

I was cooking and there was hot oil on the stove and he was crying bloody murder for no reason and crawling to me, which is dangerous while I’m by the stove, so i yelled at him. He cried so much until he asked me to hold him and fell asleep
4369 2018-06-27 15:39:03 It looked as though this time things would be different but #Mex has reverted back to what they usually are in these tournaments. Always find a way to self-implode though but #GER could still save them. Craziness!!! #WorldCup
4370 2018-06-27 15:39:02 Welaita: How do you solve all this problems if you are cash trapped? The country needs income sources be it gas, oil, or coffee. Then you can fund social programs, build houses, etc. Besides, the local government is working on the issues you raised.

•why didn't we keep Iraq oil; "What happened to 'To the victors go the spoils?"
•Russia's Crimea takeover ok
•we should use our military
•huge military spending increase

How long before Trump, getting more brazen daily, uses military for some spoils, like Russia did?

4410 2018-06-27 15:35:36 I apologise for my tweet, it was rude of me. 

Cultivation is destroying the natural habitats of several creatures forever, and the methods used by those to clear land does little to help them. Palm oil isn't essential in terms of food in the way that rice or corn are.

Yes, I gave her a bonus.

4422 2018-06-27 15:34:40 Hello, The beard oil and butter is multipurpose yes
4423 2018-06-27 15:34:38 Eventually this propaganda took on a life of its own, pushed by anti-tax GOP politicians already bought & paid for by oil lobbyists. Govt-hating Tea Party cranks began to believe climate change & investing in solar & wind were sinister left-wing conspiracies.

4435 2018-06-27 15:33:46 Oooo, that happened. I was out of town and had a housesitter who knocked the olive oil off the counter. That was in October. I'm still finding glass, and part of the kitchen floor still feels funny.
4436 2018-06-27 15:33:46 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brothers. And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon David from that day forward. 1 Sam. 16:13

4446 2018-06-27 15:32:38 The difference is that Khartoum will be stealing our oil instead of protecting it from it...,And btw, if it's a peace agreement, why do we still need a custody or protection of oil fields
4447 2018-06-27 15:32:34 UN is a joke, in thrall to leftist insanity and Arab oil. Puts countries like Saudi Arabia on human rights councils. Preposterous. 1 Jewish country and 50 Muslim-majority countries. Gee. I wonder why so many in world bow to your kind of ideology? Hint: not because of TRUTH.

4452 2018-06-27 15:32:08 Agree, I think a major factor in oil specs s that a lot of people lost a lot of money on the way down a few years ago.

4457 2018-06-27 15:31:37 I do a variety of egg rolls (cheese steak, Ruben, cheeseburger, etc) during football season. Someone already mentioned oil mist, which helps them.

It also does frozen fries SO well...

4467 2018-06-27 15:30:27 yeah, you’re right. CBD oil can help with a number of things. but sometimes it’s not strong enough for people who have cancer, arthritis, CP, MD, etc. therefore they may need something stronger to help. passing this isn’t ab potheads. recreationally, will be. but not medical.
4468 2018-06-27 15:30:21 don't forget vlad. oil prices rising
4469 2018-06-27 15:30:21 I haven't had to pay for oil changes for the past 6 years, but @Kia got rid of their free oil changes, free car washes, free tire rotations, and free inspections program .

4471 2018-06-27 15:30:20 I just let my cat smell different things so he can get past the curiosity.. I let him smell a toilet paper roll this morning. Not impressed. He smelled my face oil. Hated it. Smelled my toe. Indifferent. 

You never know with him..

4474 2018-06-27 15:30:13 We always had canned hummus when I was a kid. My mother used to add olive oil and lemon juice to it, but I can still remember a *tinny* taste.

I wish I'd told you that before and saved you.
4475 2018-06-27 15:30:09 Ain't that the truth
4476 2018-06-27 15:30:08 Crude prices soar as oil stockpiles drop by nearly 10M barrels
Crude oil prices extend earlier gains after the U.S. reported crude stocks fell by nearly 10M barrels last week, far more than expected, as refiners processed 17.8M bbl/day of crude, the most ever in a single week.
4477 2018-06-27 15:29:59 fenty beautys oil blotting sheets double as rolling paper and i think about that a lot
4478 2018-06-27 15:29:51 Very timely news considering last weeks announcement from @sajidjavid that the UK will be considering loosening restrictions on cannabis oil for #epilepsy sufferers. Could regulated drugs like these replace the need for #cannabis oil in these patients?
4479 2018-06-27 15:29:49 Still naked unless I’m frying something in oil lol

4485 2018-06-27 15:28:58 But if Stalin didn't want Germany to gain power, why did they engage in trade with them, especially for strategic resources such as oil? Why did they help Nazis rearm?
4486 2018-06-27 15:28:52 Conscience is like an oil lamp, it lights up as long as there is oil in the vial. Then, suddenly, it blows out
4487 2018-06-27 15:28:47 We're sorry to see! Try baby wipes, baby oil or make-up remover. You may find that keeping the area moist with water will help to lift the stain.
4488 2018-06-27 15:28:44 GE finally deciding to leave the oil and health sectors with Baker Hughes being alone again will change the narrative of subsea projects going forward. Especially all the new projects springing up in Africa.

4492 2018-06-27 15:28:26 Man, it sucks you never realize you overloaded oil in your hair until four days later when you're trying to wear your hair down and its still saturating your back in oil. #naturalhair

4494 2018-06-27 15:27:57 @realDonaldTrump what are you going to do about soaring oil prices. Fix it, mr dealmaker.
4495 2018-06-27 15:27:55 That is my design for hauling oil!!! If the ship sinks the containers stay afloat with flashing lights and a honing beacon for recovery!!!

4500 2018-06-27 15:27:36 I have colds and headache since yesterday. Then instead of taking medicine, I mixed eucalyptus oil, peppermint oil and tea tree oil in a diffuser. Voila! Smells good! Day 2! I really hope I'll be ok before heading to Taiwan next week. Good night
4501 2018-06-27 15:27:35 The Machine looks to be running outta oil #GER
4502 2018-06-27 15:27:32 Mostly, the elected democratic govt leave such big issues, oil/electric prices, economy issues... for caretaker govts, to avoid “blame”. In other word, they are not competent to take decision and also lack sense of responsibilty... #Corrupt #Irresponsible

4511 2018-06-27 15:26:17 Hence other oil producing nations which are not in OPEC are free* to ramp up production to (a) take advantage of high prices, or (b) to stabilise prices.

* But OPEC generates about 60% of world oil exports.
4512 2018-06-27 15:26:16 Since they're usually leaking oil, should be easy enough
4513 2018-06-27 15:26:13 Think about it the fed isnt picking op the slack in USTs. The dollar has to stay up to keep investors clipping those coupons. Oil has kind of graduated to a world of its own atm, for various reasons
4514 2018-06-27 15:26:07 I use the vintage made in Japan ones found only in finer thrift stores occasionally and on eBay. However, my mad crush is correct. My Bamix has me in the hummus pink. International hummus! Fuck nationalized hummus. I kick up the tahini with toasted sesame oil. From China.
4515 2018-06-27 15:26:03 While federal judge's decision to dismiss lawsuit against oil companies may be disappointing, the reasoning is sound:
1) This is a global issue a local judge can't decide, should be tackled by other 2 branches of gov't;
2) We are all responsible, not just oil companies.
4516 2018-06-27 15:26:02 確かに雑なサッカーだ
4517 2018-06-27 15:26:01 My daughter needs to come home now. We need to watch cartoons. Talk. Speak lovingly and weird to each other. And cuddle so close I can smell the coconut oil in her hair. I miss my little broke BFF
4518 2018-06-27 15:25:52 Until you find the cream, you can rub a little butter or cooking oil on. But make sure you wash it off in the morning before something decides you smell tasty

4520 2018-06-27 15:25:49 This meant going against reality, but the tobacco industry provided a well-tested template for smearing scientists, muddying facts, and lobbying against studying the problem. The oil industry just stepped it up.

4524 2018-06-27 15:25:27 Crude Days of Supply including exports(which I have no idea why the @EIAgov doesn't include this now) over the 4 week period ending 6/22 is at 20.7 days. Last time it was this low crude oil was 93 dollar/barrel. #crudeoil #CL_F
4525 2018-06-27 15:25:25 is there a hornier sport than Turkish oil wrestling?

4527 2018-06-27 15:25:09 My family was apparently the rightful heir to a multi-billion dollar oil fortune from the late 19th century, stymied forever by lack of a will when an ancestor died young in a bar-room brawl
4528 2018-06-27 15:25:07 I do see a lot of that oil going to Asia at a steep discount

4530 2018-06-27 15:24:56 es mala? qué hace? yo he probado la de oliva, la de argan, la negra de proteinas, y la de castor oil y flaxseed y todas son super buenas.

Nunca he comprado la blanca plain (la que no es de coco), ni la azul pq no confío.. 
4531 2018-06-27 15:24:50 I think Eastern Europe needs to look more at trade with the US. If a Russian Pipeline is a problem, they should consider building their own and importing US oil and natural gas as a possible option, using the Baltic Sea as the entry point.
4532 2018-06-27 15:24:45 It is a conglomeration of oil producing states rather than companies, so really it's up to them to decide whether it's legal or not. To borrow from Nixon: If OPEC does it, it's not illegal. But also, strictly they set production levels, not prices.
4533 2018-06-27 15:24:42 How about emerging market turmoil is going to eventually crush oil!
4534 2018-06-27 15:24:38 勝手にやってくれればいいけどこっちのこともほっといてね

4541 2018-06-27 15:24:00 #Ethiopia to start producing crude oil just tomorrow, Prime minister #Abiy claimed. Is this guy a bless or he is simply uncovering what have been hidden from the people by the authorities?

4548 2018-06-27 15:23:40 Is it Natural Gas or Crude Oil? I don't feel it is timely to announce at this time of turmoil and instability.

4565 2018-06-27 15:22:18 It’s more to do with US sanctions on Iran which can take off almost 1.5mbpd out of market and OPEC will increase oil production by 1 mbpd.

Soviets divided Europe with Nazis and helped Nazis by sending them oil, grain and raw materials.
You can dream about Fachists all you like but the truth is, no one wanted neither Nazis nor Soviets.

4600 2018-06-27 15:18:45 i've only been taking cbd oil for a week and my anxiety is already better than it's been in years! i've only smoked thc ONCE the past two days which is huge for me!!!
4601 2018-06-27 15:18:40 Saudi Arabia never had “control” of a world #oil market of ~99 million b/d with spare capacity of only ~3 million b/d. It just wanted everyone to think it did, and most of us went along.
4602 2018-06-27 15:18:38 Strange thingsnnweak economic data, strong oil with strong dollar
4603 2018-06-27 15:18:37 OPEC and Trump (so he says) want oil at 50-60 maybe by midterm elections we see it. Parabolic stuff this is...
4604 2018-06-27 15:18:35 I’ve worked for the oil industry that provides that mkwnt for my entire adult life. And like I said, I’d rather have my mineral rights.
4605 2018-06-27 15:18:35 Dan ponds, garnier kecuali micellar yg baru yg oil itu lah apa. Wardah juga lol
4606 2018-06-27 15:18:34 In fact India should start importing oil from Venezuela and Russia.
4607 2018-06-27 15:18:34 It is beautiful and I would expect no less from that area given $15 million of BP oil spill money. Excellent for University of Tampa students and faculty. Situated on higher ground in Tampa, would like to see such investment for walking and fun around USF's Fowler avenue.
4608 2018-06-27 15:18:27 $UWT oil on the rebound! 
4609 2018-06-27 15:18:27 Point is, unless you're making Ethanol, Sugar isn't a byproduct of Oil and gas industry. So they weren't using the Sugar for that. They were importing to sell.
4610 2018-06-27 15:18:24 i personally use aquafor as well as baby oil to keep my skin very moisturized. my doctor also prescribed a cream to me which has really helped to tone it down and take it away.

Enmity with Israel has led to international sanctions & our isolation. We must also settle with Saudis. Meeting of Iranian & Saudi Oil Ministers was good start.

Needless to that this guy who as minister sought to disenfranchise Canadians by restricting our rights to vote. Picked fight with Elections Canada and used public servants for partisan means
4635 2018-06-27 15:16:39 This is just one war among many other wars that Trump started against US allies and partners. The fate of this war connected to others! Iran is in better situation internationally and internally. Oil isn't as important as be4 in Iran revenue. it can tolerate even whole sanction.

4644 2018-06-27 15:15:18 I should thought about it all these surge in oil price is because of US withdraw from JCPOA next I guess US _ RUSSIA relationship will improve and vice versa for China
4645 2018-06-27 15:15:09 ITS DELICIOUS. I keep coconut oil for my hair in my cauldron tho

4648 2018-06-27 15:15:02 Last night, Charlie (the cat from my complex) & I collided. I was walking in one direction, and he was running in the same direction. Already he & I were like oil and water. Now he straight up hates me, & refuses to hide it. I’m actually a little hurt by this and idk why tbh.

4651 2018-06-27 15:14:55 This is so sad. Or you have patients like me . I told my doctor that I didn’t need daily pain management anymore because I was using CBD oil and he told me he couldn’t even give me 10 pills a year anymore for when I have a bad flareup with my neck. He said its pills or CBD(0%thc)
4652 2018-06-27 15:14:50 oil money. simple.
4653 2018-06-27 15:14:46 Everybody wants me to this and that but nobody is throwing money for gas, oil changes due to the insane mileage, and tires . Fuck that
4654 2018-06-27 15:14:44 Hi Tim, I just had a quick question about this article. I wondered if you could share where you got your number on the country's oil production? I would appreciate it very much. I looked at official gvt. numbers and they says it produced 28 mil. in 2017, an avg. of about 77k/day.
4655 2018-06-27 15:14:31 Yes so long as there is a UK its UK oil but as soon as we're independent there is no UK
4656 2018-06-27 15:14:26 How on Earth are the two situations similar? And if so, then what's the difference between oil backed clubs and "growing" or rebuilding clubs like Milan or Lille where money comes from suspicious loans and shady owners

4660 2018-06-27 15:14:10 That’s normal for them to check that when an oil change is being done. Literally every mechanic everywhere does it. It’s for your own safety.

This just happened with the guy performing my oil change.

4664 2018-06-27 15:13:47 @steveliesman Since the 50's there's been a popular political slogan in Brazil "O petroleo e nosso" (the oil is OURS) - ie foreigners hands off.

4687 2018-06-27 15:11:16 Not 1 "new" bbl was +, and the macro picture worsened, due to artificial $ dampening, through use of spare cap. FID's will remain delayed, "real" cost of oil deferred.

4737 2018-06-27 15:06:24 You do know the Syrian war was started for cooperation who make weapons & dig for oil you do know the Afghanistan war was pharmaceutical companies wanting to stop the opiod distribution to control it for themselves. Wars are started by capitalist who want to make money.
4738 2018-06-27 15:06:15 He gave away Badame without consulting those who live in the area and now he wants to extract oil from Ogaden region without going to meet the people. Dr Abiye should make rational decisions otherwise he w'll fail.@AbdikaniH

4743 2018-06-27 15:05:54 Unexpectedly low US crude inventories mean oil prices are headed higher, already at 2014 end levels again. Tank up folks!
4744 2018-06-27 15:05:54 Well done Baron m8. I bought #GKP a while before U at 148p and 154p but sold it way too early at 210p average so well done, youve called it brilliantly and I agree that it should go higher still with oil on the up. Nice one.
4745 2018-06-27 15:05:53 @PressSec @seanhannity @AnnCoulter @realDonaldTrump so, not Saudi Arabia? why not donnie boy? most of the money that funds ISIL comes from Saudi Arabi. of course, oil and filthy lucre. you are such a bottom feeding, money grabbing scumbag!
4746 2018-06-27 15:05:53 What do you mean “ a deal on oil “ ?do you mean a pipeline to tidewater? 
Cuz if you do, all Trudeau did was elbow a private investor out of its own project and spend a bunch more money we have to borrow... for what? Optics?? We are further away from a pipeline to tw than ever!

4750 2018-06-27 15:05:08 U.S. Oil Exports Matched, If Not Execeeded, Iran’s

(Bloomberg) -- With the U.S. exporting last week a record 3.0 million barrels a day of crude, America is shipping overseas (on a gross basis) as much oil, if not more, than Iran, according to Bloomberg

4756 2018-06-27 15:04:22 Had a good meme for crude but can't get it to load on my mobile.   Oh well. The point would be that anyone betting against a higher oil price and sticking to a bearish narrative is getting destroyed here.

4758 2018-06-27 15:04:16 Instead of using dough for pizza, get a cast iron pan, some pam or olive oil, get a nice, thick omelette going and cover that up with some grated cheese, pepperoni, chopped bell peppers (or jalapenos), some salt, pepper, maybe some other toppings like mushrooms, bacon, etc.
4759 2018-06-27 15:04:08 Recent cut stemming from uncertainties about Libyan oil (about 400k b/d) and uncertainties about economic sanctions on Iran push oil prices up. Brent  78$/b. 10 $ increase causes significant growth cut (about %1) and inflation hike (%0,5) for a large number of countries. Too bad.
4760 2018-06-27 15:04:07 Structurally, a massive crude oil bull. I don't trade crude. I focus on the macro picture, and long E&P's, as a major portion of my portfolio. I'm also long financials. But, 15% of my holdings are cash, because of global instability. All of this said, today has really surprised!

4765 2018-06-27 15:03:52 This is a socialist country and did you read the 3rd paragraph of the article you just sent me?  “Venezuela is rich in oil. It has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But it is arguably precisely this wealth that is also at the root of many of its economic problems.”

4777 2018-06-27 15:03:04 tbh I was taking the piss. IMO it’s more likely to be due to a strengthening oil price.
The Tories always argue the reverse is true though because they rely on people being thick or poorly informed.

4840 2018-06-27 14:59:12 Question is when growth will start to suffer because of the higher oil price. Americans are known for paying a lot of attention to what they are paying at the pump and it must soon start to affect consumer confidence.
4841 2018-06-27 14:59:09 $3 still possible... I hate to even mention it, but the bulls are running wild with State Dept cutting Iran oil flows in Nov., EIA data today, and OPEC offering a measly 600kbpd. All the ingredients to make another run at $3/gal nationally are there. #gasprices
4842 2018-06-27 14:58:47 Priced in Euros Oil is now at its highest level since Nov 2014 which seems a little bizarre given the potential slowing in Eurozone economic growth (negative surprises)

4869 2018-06-27 14:56:45 If you have a sous-vide, then get a whole octopus from whole foods... salt, olive oil & rosemary, then finish it on a grill, chop up & mix. The juice from the octopus can be deglazed easily for a sauce (pancetta, etc). This dish is a lot easier than you'd imagine & very popular.
4870 2018-06-27 14:56:44 The question is are we ready t harness this opportunity ??? These oil companies have very stringent quality and certification requirements

4900 2018-06-27 14:54:24 Remarkable how few true believers in the bull market in crude oil there seem to be, with the oil bull now more than 2 years old & repeatedly confirmed in a powerful uptrend.

4992 2018-06-27 14:46:42 Isn’t putting the head of one of the largest oil companies in the world in charge of oil prices in the US like putting the Fox in charge of the hen house?

You need to wake up to reality.
You support those who have taken 92% of scots oil revenues for 50 years and you believe them when they tell you Scotland is skint!

5019 2018-06-27 14:44:49 Kenya is already on track for that we  are now exporting crude oil.
But the plus for me here  is that finally Ethiopia accepts that it has oil in the Ogaden.
The transparency is good.
5020 2018-06-27 14:44:37  is sick. I'm pretty sure it's just allergies that have likely escalated to a sinus infection. I wanted to put vicks in a candle warmer but some quick googling told me that was an awful idea. I think I'll get some eucalyptus oil after work and put it in the warmer instead.
5021 2018-06-27 14:44:37 I wasn’t expecting the list to be gadgets. Please. I’ve made due with much less. It’s certain ingredients that are more important. You got the olive oil right. 
5022 2018-06-27 14:44:36 You guys... I’ve been using this @sundayriley UFO Acne Oil for 5 days and I swear I already see a difference in my skin.  
5023 2018-06-27 14:44:24 I forecast they will sponsor independent research that proves that they have superior snake oil and live on forever!  We will build a wall... then let them inside the wall to fill it with "value add" (a.k.a. attack surface of dubious value)
5024 2018-06-27 14:44:22 Trump wants lower oil price so with oil markets tightening he cuts off one of the larger suppliers of oil.  This guy really is clueless.
5025 2018-06-27 14:44:19 Hmmmmmm, “knowledgeable about the oil patch”. Kinda like how almost everything Steve Williams says about climate change and carbon taxes directly contradict what Kenney says? Funny that if Kenney knows so much more than Williams he won’t call him on it, only criticize the ndp.

5031 2018-06-27 14:44:00 Stocks up.

Oil up.
Dollar up (?).  If this drops risk moves much higher.
Two risks to risk:
- Fed likely holds its ground.
- Funds get trapped long, worried about missing the SPX 3000 move.
5032 2018-06-27 14:43:51 3 new US records: refineries processed 17.8 million barrels per day of oil last week, exported 8.5 million barrels per day of oil/products and produced 10.95 million barrels per day of oil. #oott #oil

5054 2018-06-27 14:42:27 Is it Crude Oil or Natural Gas?
5055 2018-06-27 14:42:24 Yeah & I'd like my taxes to stop being used to subside wealthy industries like oil. We don't always get what we want. Just b/c you want to pay per visit doesn't mean that's how it ought to be. ALSO teachers are service providers that only service some & they still paid w/taxes.
5056 2018-06-27 14:42:24 raw coconut oil is great - also is an anti bacterial (cute peek a boo shoes).
5057 2018-06-27 14:42:21 Holy crap--Crude oil exports hit 3,000 thou b/d. Insane rate of increase the last year.  #oil

5064 2018-06-27 14:41:29 At that time the prices of petrol & diesel were not decontrolled. Those were decontrolled in 2013 by UPA Government. Since then the control of these prices r in the hands of oil companies. However in case of excessive increase the Government must interfere.
5065 2018-06-27 14:41:28 I looooove their Niacinamide + Zinc solution esp for clearing up acne. The rosehip oil is nice for nighttime use, but it’s pretty thick, so more of a wintertime deal for my combo skin. If u have dry skin tho give it a whirl.

5085 2018-06-27 14:40:18 :) ha. Believe it or not, there have been experiments capturing the gas. Joking aside, the opportunity is in waste methane from oil and gas operations. This gas is often flared to produce waste CO2 which is less harmful but methane is valuable in production of graphene.

5105 2018-06-27 14:38:44 I usually wallow in sadness at how my article on the geographies of beard oil was rejected. But then I go to car boot sales... Not really to buy anything but to feel like a man of the people.

5115 2018-06-27 14:38:11 If Aug. crude oil breaks out above 7300, that will suggest a push to 7510. U.S. inventories were DOWN 9.891 million barrels... way more than expected.  Distillates were up, but the imbalance can't last long.  Summer driving season is just getting started.  Consumers will feel it!

5299 2018-06-27 14:23:07 the death of the oil industry is inevitable. the painful death - rapid job losses, decimated Alberta tax base - is not.

increase taxes, stimulate *other* industries, stop giving subsidies to oil. it will still hurt, but not near as much as it will with the path Alberta is on now

5351 2018-06-27 14:16:02 Abnormally large spikes in oil last Friday, yesterday and today. Talking heads blame it on this or that but in reality, its the oil kingpins wanting high prices for the July 4th driving week. Gotta take as much as they can from average Americans. Call a spade a spade. #RealTalk
5352 2018-06-27 14:15:58 Why are Mnuchin and Perry meeting with Russian Energy Director, Novak? The biggest oil deal in history between Exxon and Russia was ended when Russia invaded Crimea.

5357 2018-06-27 14:15:40 This #CarbonTax is supposed to lead to lowered emissions. So it would make sense that provinces that create an industry around energy and emissions (like #Alberta with our oil industry) get the highest bill, right? So then, explain something to me;

5399 2018-06-27 14:12:11 But it is reported that 80% of the oil blocks are owned by Northerners. I know not all of them are extremist but they have friends who are. In the end, they are pretty much well funded to coordinate these attacks.

In fact, Trump will probably legalize it. Lastly, conservative evangelicals love what Cornett has done w/OKC business.

5423 2018-06-27 14:08:37 Data is certainly similar to oil in that it “fuels” the data economy. The benefits are that the more it is used, the more value it creates without decreasing the supply.
5424 2018-06-27 14:08:28 No oil painting, that's for sure 
5425 2018-06-27 14:08:21 Snake oil might be better, but that is getting rarer.

5433 2018-06-27 14:06:25 What do you mean you cannot change it?, the US and UK are still stomping all over Iraq stealing all the oil they can swallow, and now Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, they need to stop ALL of it
5434 2018-06-27 14:06:22 I could get behind clean burning incinerators to generate power from garbage like Europe is doing but that can’t seem to get traction with our politicians.  Odd b/c it is environmentally friendly & solves landfill issues at same time.  Am against further investment in oil too FYI

5569 2018-06-27 13:49:38 Trump trying to blackmail the EU and Asia over Iranian oil. Say no Iranian oil may be bought or else. 
Many middle fingers in the EU and China are probably going up.

5575 2018-06-27 13:49:20 we are your largest trading partner, you are also dependent on us, we are your largest supplier of foreign oil, we supply u with cheap electricity as well. We need to work together and tell the truth about the current circumstances.

5584 2018-06-27 13:48:32 People underestimate the value of cuticle oil.
5585 2018-06-27 13:48:28 I have called my reps and have been tweeting media for a week now. Nobody seems interested. Trump purposefully creates choas to divert attention. The Russia/Exxon oil deal was the biggest in history & was sanctioned when Russia invaded Crimea. Trump is trying to revise it.

5592 2018-06-27 13:47:53 Trump is asking US allies to take huge losses for his reckless Iran policy...

Diplomat tells me Japan is unlikely to end all Iranian oil purchases. Some Japanese oil facilities are specifically designed for Iranian oil. A complete ban would force these importers into bankruptcy.
5593 2018-06-27 13:47:35 I started using this face wash by L'Oreal, that gets rid of oil. It's really good. Like, I apply it in the morning and I survive until I get home.

5595 2018-06-27 13:47:28 exactly, the oil goes to the country, but trump sure does benefit from it in that sense. Better economy = more money (that trump eventually benefits from)

5604 2018-06-27 13:46:10 You missed the war in Iraq Mr British ‘Empire’ in which hundreds of thousands of people died.  They didn’t have any choice to ‘put their lives on the line’ as you are claiming you did.  Mothers chilren, elderly, disabled, all slaughtered so the US could pillage Iraq’s oil.

5620 2018-06-27 13:44:49 Take what happened to Russia for instance. After first, under Obama, they refused to meet regarding Syria, the Saudis dipped prices of oil, Russia couldnt sustain the loss and in a week went to the table. Saudis then set oil back to normal.

5622 2018-06-27 13:44:23 No need for imagination.  If you're in Calgary, almost every business is affected by the O&G industry.  As a home builder, we felt it almost as immediately as the oil companies. Then all the transient workers from Quebec went back home.

Yah, ask me how I feel about equalization.

5638 2018-06-27 13:42:50 When refineries make oil processing, they generate a large amount of waste. Our PRT-2 plant can refine all that waste to different types of fuel.

5648 2018-06-27 13:41:41 He's a salesman. Get used to it. We accept it because he isn't selling snake oil. This guy gets results. He actually delivers on his campaign promises, unlike both Bushs that talked a good game, then led like a liberal on economic and other issues, which was beyond disappointing.
5649 2018-06-27 13:41:35 Just like consumer gas prices tied to price of oil (though elevator up / escalator down) so too mortgage rates loosely to drop in 10 year yield (now 2.85%). Mortgage rate may trickle down bit further. As for Markets remember the 3% tantrum? Game on - til next headline/bs event.

5675 2018-06-27 13:39:27 $FSLR Time to see the $60.  Lots of demand and benefits for clean energy installment.  Oil continue rising will boost the Solar Panels demand higher. Long on it.

5682 2018-06-27 13:38:59 The U.S. official said the United States was working with Middle East countries to increase production so the global oil supply isn't harmed.
5683 2018-06-27 13:38:54 All the stable currencies in the world are either backed by gold or oil reserves. If properly managed this can be a game-changer. However we need to make a first issue which is lower that Rand and peg it there. This will manage our trade deficits. @ZimMediaReview @edmnangagwa
5684 2018-06-27 13:38:54 CRUDE OIL

The higher crude oil price goes now, the lower the lows will be after crude oil is dumped from storage to the consumption market.
5685 2018-06-27 13:38:50 The price of U.S. crude jumped to more than $2 on June 26 to $70 a barrel for the first time since May as the threat that the United States would push buyers to limit Iranian oil imports added to concerns about tightening supplies.
5686 2018-06-27 13:38:48 I use Coconut oil, baking soda and a drop of peppermint oil..mix together in a small jar ad store in your fridge 
5687 2018-06-27 13:38:44 USA has nothing to do with Venezuela's issues. Facts: Chavez nationalized large parts of the economy. Ran socialist programs on the back of oil exports. Oil prices dropped in 2014 and the over reliance on oil lead to start of price controls and hyperinflation.

5691 2018-06-27 13:38:06 Gold dropping as expected. Still believe a violent reversal will happen somewhere $1240s-1250s. How oil goes will depend on whether EIA can deliver the same level of draws. Ironically, the Iran news will be more long-term bullish for gold than for oil.
5692 2018-06-27 13:38:05 -1 tablespoon coconut oil
-1/2 ripe avocado

Mash the avocado until it’s lump-free. Mix in the coconut. Apply the mixture and leave it on for 15 minutes. This will allow the mask to penetrate deeply into the skin delivering essential nutrients to the cells and also unclog pores.

I decided to find this oil. And I found it, KoS and @QueenofShaves and the rest is history. Using KoS exclusively since.

5698 2018-06-27 13:37:37 will be a great year for #oil prices... Tougher action from #USA and its allies on #Iran... Oil price will increase accordingly.....

#ukog starting extemeded well test... A great buy in opportunity that may put on shore #UK oil onto the international map.. Lots of opportunities.

5700 2018-06-27 13:37:11 Maybe oil the PLA to keep it from sticking? That's usually an issue with all metal hotends.
5701 2018-06-27 13:37:07 Grossly overstated surely.  Britain owes its economy to North Sea Oil and Financial Services none of which were contributed to by immigration in any way shape or form, save for cleaning banks' offices
5702 2018-06-27 13:37:05 USD/CAD seems miss priced here between oil and interest rate differentials if should be a lot lower...
5703 2018-06-27 13:37:02 How about fixing the water issue for those Indigenous inhabitants of Canada in stead of wasting the money on a dying energy technology.
We don't have the time to not phase out oil if you build Kinder Morgan
5704 2018-06-27 13:36:54 USD/CAD seems miss priced here between oil and interest rate differentials if should be a lot lower...

5715 2018-06-27 13:35:50 Maxine Waters is an American hero! You are a snake oil sales in the final stages of syphilis! Your continued unhinged ranting will stop in a few months when Dems take back Congress and you’re put in federal prison and civility is restored to our country!
5716 2018-06-27 13:35:50 Oil went to $80 last month...
5717 2018-06-27 13:35:43 The United States is pushing countries to halt Iranian oil imports from early November, a senior State Department official said on June 26, warning that Washington will not grant any sanction waivers.
5718 2018-06-27 13:35:38 Further contributing to our declining mental health is the pervasive low-fat dogma. We cannot have healthy brains on a low-fat diet (or a vegetable oil diet).

5720 2018-06-27 13:35:18 Been using CBD oil for a couple weeks. I have epilepsy & the meds cause me severe anxiety. I have been using it whenever needed during the day, but especially at night before sleeping along with a weighted blanket and it has been making a big difference. Try it out!
5721 2018-06-27 13:35:01 ...silver lining to all of this, the rest of the world is making huge strides towards peaceful economic relationships.  Even the Saudis and Russians are working together with oil. The rest of the world is moving toward shared economic prosperity and America is not included.
5722 2018-06-27 13:34:46 U know I did! Lol I've never seen that 1 though. Island White Sand has monoi oil in it & I love that fragrance so I'm gonna look for the 1 u posted next time I go.

5725 2018-06-27 13:34:14 Yep, he has to keep up looks, we are handing Syria to Putin so he can export more oil
5726 2018-06-27 13:34:13 Stop tweeting about Mrs. Waters and find something else. Other good Twitter topics might be the national debt and tariffs. Phil Bredesen of TN is using tariffs in his ads. Maintaining world oil supplies after Nov 4 is another good one. So much other stuff to talk about.

5733 2018-06-27 13:33:43 Tuesday Trump announced that anyone buying Iranian oil would face U.S. sanctions. Thank goodness Russia is sitting right next door and has plenty of oil to sell. #TrumpRussia @realDonaldTrump

Someone threw a bottle of Omega-3 capsules at me this morning. Luckily, my injuries were only super fish oil.
5735 2018-06-27 13:33:41 In reality, corruption is a symptom of more bigger problem, restructuring, overpopulation & economic stagnation (due to fixation on oil). Any sensible nation will expand d economy thru SME growth & make more money, not d paltry $20-30B we earn yearly; yet population is ballooning
5736 2018-06-27 13:33:39 Some reasons, USDINR targets 71/75/85.Base metals&oil mega bull run will start in 2019,will run many years. Indian banks NPAs 20 % of advances, China& Pak border troubles expected,2019 elections not likely not decisive. Most imp : most Indian small/mid cap cos accounts are fake.

5740 2018-06-27 13:33:28 NK/Venezuela are on banned list to white-wash that it's a Muslim ban. NKs aren't allowed to travel to US, so it's meaningless. W/Venezuela, it's the next war for oil in the making. Create more refugees & give rise to extremists, creating our next enemy. (Like Taliban & ISIS b4.)

5753 2018-06-27 13:32:15 Every day we hear somoilandgas but 
There is no single production in somalia 
And we don't understand why these friengers 
Are involving our country?  I can say our country don't have a time of production gas and oil we desperate need peace and security.
5754 2018-06-27 13:32:13 Your first mistake is conflating communism and socialism, your second is not doing any research whatsoever and just listening to Limbaugh. Venezuelas entire social safety net was dependent on oil. When that crashed, their economy crashed. Mix that with a shit president and voila.

5763 2018-06-27 13:31:16 “National security” reasons, my arse. It’s about removing the competition for US oil. Look who’s share price went up following the announcement….

5766 2018-06-27 13:30:54 All false reporting about taxes, look at the actual brackets.. taxes went up for top percentage of people. Tax breaks to corporations. “Prices going up” not sure what that refers to but if it’s fuel Trump@is demanding cut in oil prices which will LOWER prices. Next..

5769 2018-06-27 13:30:48 Harley Davidson motorcycles made with pride in THAILAND? Move was planned before the large corporate tax cuts, lowering of regulations, future tax simplification, and lower energy costs due to increased oil and gas exploration. Big mistake Harley. Sad end to an American icon.
5770 2018-06-27 13:30:42 What you're seeing is not peanut-based, but a mixture of oil and crumbs that resembles peanut butter. Regular Ritz Crackers do not contain peanut butter. Would you please send us a DM with the UPC, expiration date, and the letters and numbers that follow? Thanks!
5771 2018-06-27 13:30:31 Even as oil prices trade near the highest in four years, offices in Calgary are about as empty as they’ve been since at least 2008. Vacancy rate climbed to about 23% in Q1, up from 20% a year earlier, according to a report from Toronto-based Altus Group Ltd.
5772 2018-06-27 13:29:48 If a pot doesn't contain a kernels and the oil.. what's the solution.. DIVISION.. Sir you right.. the country is already divided but the British government join us together.. l hope we can go our different ways now

5774 2018-06-27 13:29:46 Scotlands revenue income and expenditure has not been published since 1921. Why is that?
During 1900-1921 the amount of Scotland’s revenue income spent outwith Scotland ranged from 41% and 89%. Even without oil Westminster was creaming off a surplus.
Where did the debt come from?
5775 2018-06-27 13:29:44 Big Oil. The Kochs & other "libertarian" Billionaires have worked HARD (given 100's of billions) to get us where we are today. They've BOUGHT the GOP. They don't care about this Country or, Us. They care about increasing their OWN wealth & power. 'Dark Money' by, Jane Mayer.

5780 2018-06-27 13:29:20 The Oil have to overpay it’s players to compete with many markets (taxation, northern allowance & hostile/rabid fans in Edmonton). Case in point: Stamkos pays no tax in Florida, thus can be paid less. That is the milieu of today’s NHL.
5781 2018-06-27 13:29:18 I see Prez #DonaldTrump is causing the cost of oil to rise.

5785 2018-06-27 13:28:57 I think this has more to do with end of quarter flight to the only thing that has gone up. Remember, everybody was bullish on oil this year, especially @goldmansachs.  Nobody is accounting for higher SA, Russia, US production etc.  Or, weakening demand. Or stronger dollar. Or etc
5786 2018-06-27 13:28:53 Hehehe! I've slathered myself in cooking oil. Serious baking time!

5795 2018-06-27 13:28:19 Crude approaching previous high, bonds up... but, Dollar also rallying with gold and silver down.  Obviously, markets are not aligned, yet.  Gold and silver chart show challenge to bottom of range. Could be time to buy if oil stays strong.  Lower interest rates should dip Dollar!
5796 2018-06-27 13:28:19 #oott Shale was about cheap and plentiful oil #brent, yet the recent events have shown we can forget the cheap oil.
5797 2018-06-27 13:28:15 "Even in the worst case, I promise that the basic needs of Iranians will be provided. We have enough sugar, wheat, and cooking oil. We have enough foreign currency to inject into the market," Rohani said.
5798 2018-06-27 13:28:12 check your oil, it might not be much but it is something.
5799 2018-06-27 13:28:08 Always act hard as fuck putting tanning oil on and laying in the sun for hours then cry like a baby in the night when I’m so sun burnt I can’t lay down :)
5800 2018-06-27 13:28:07 The resumption of sanctions could see Iran's hard currency earnings from oil export drop substantially, prompting many Iranians to convert their savings in rials into hard currencies.

5810 2018-06-27 13:27:11 Mr @realDonaldTrump gave the best gift to the #oil market: he spotted the need (call it cried) for new more suppply. Hence the market has now a perception of a possible shortage.... that fueled the price rise. Well done Ginger. Any more Tweet??? #oott

5815 2018-06-27 13:26:48 Jonny, where you’re wrong is that oil was already tanking late summer of 14 (I was in a meeting with some husky execs that oct about it) and second, it’s the Cons blaming ndp for the crash but refusing to give credit for the resurgence. The exact opposite of what you said!

5957 2018-06-27 13:13:20 I advise to leave the comfort of your apt in London and go to Tehran to advise the mullahs not to even think about interrupting the oil flow. Iran will not know what hit them.
5958 2018-06-27 13:13:17 Babaghanoush (charred, peeled, puréed with oil, garlic, maybe lemon), moussaka is classic if complicated, or scoop out middles, chop + mix with tomato, onion, garlic, oregano, par-cooked rice, stuff into shell + bake.

5961 2018-06-27 13:13:00 Nobody wants to pay more than they need to the big utility companies or fuel oil dealer. Old, inefficient heating & cooling systems and water heaters have been neglected through the years and are costing a fortune in utility bills.
5962 2018-06-27 13:12:53 Government bond prices ended lower today as rise in crude oil prices heightened fear of RBI rate hike in August. Traders remained cautious of MSP announcement. However, hope of more RBI OMO purchases supported bonds.

5989 2018-06-27 13:09:50 @realDonaldTrump So how concerned are you really over oil prices Mr. President? I mean really. Just how concerned are you when it comes to a cost that directly impacts us? Oil is up $6 in 3 business days just in case you missed it.
5990 2018-06-27 13:09:39 Gotta love the oil market. Six months ago, Opec thought it had to keep cutting or the price would crash. Now Saudi says it will produce more than ever before and people rightly doubt it will be enough to stop a damaging price surge. #oott
5991 2018-06-27 13:09:34 exactly!  It was hard for me to find an oil that worked and didnt feel like I was having a panic attack, then I discovered the CBD oils, they work perfectly
5992 2018-06-27 13:09:27 Thanks for reaching out. All travelers must comply with federal law on transporting marijuana and cannabis infused products, such as CBD oil, on board a flight.

6032 2018-06-27 13:04:35 It does make it sweeter knowing Lamb raised twice as much money as Cornett, spent almost $3MM, and was the darling of Big Oil AND CAME IN THIRD.
6033 2018-06-27 13:04:31 Because a few big producers can suddenly cause oil prices to spike by cutting production, and thereby ruining other countries.

6039 2018-06-27 13:04:12 I think they skirt the rules by being governments as the members and not the companies themselves, and everyone goes along with it because having predictable oil prices is good for the market.
6040 2018-06-27 13:04:06 Because it’s the oil industry. Until renewables can fully replace it, oil powers the global economy and that comes with perks. Among other things.
6041 2018-06-27 13:03:42 I think just having so much of the worlds oil gives them big leverage and “fuck off” money. They know we can’t do without.
6042 2018-06-27 13:03:38 In 1800's Rockefeller, aka "Dr. Livingston," aka "Devil Bill," traveled the country's back roads conning people into buying his "Rock Oil" tonic for cancer — "a useless mixture of laxative and petroleum that had no effect whatsoever,"

6044 2018-06-27 13:03:21 Add a lil oil and you could sell tickets. Bad enough that people act this way in public, even worse there's someone out there that would pay to watch it.
6045 2018-06-27 13:03:13 As long as oil is rising and the FED rises interest rates, there is little chance for the bull. A crash is more likely.
6046 2018-06-27 13:03:07 So my sinuses flared up this morning. I'm on a bus, listening to my music and I see the lady in front of me writing a little note. She gets my attention and hands me a note with "Eucalyptus oil"on it

6057 2018-06-27 13:01:59 William Avery Rockefeller fathered numerous children with three women, and took the name Livingston after being indicted for rape in 1849. One of those children was John D. Rockefeller, who became the world's first billionaire after founding Standard Oil.

6084 2018-06-27 12:58:09 That's the problem. We have each other over a barrel. They need US dollars to buy oil, and we hold 30% of their energy supply captive in Iran and their economy with US consumption, they could crash our dollar. And 2/3rd's of the world use USD's as reserve currency.

6094 2018-06-27 12:57:04 Must read. US & Israel are destabilizing Middle East. They ignore the Palestinians, try to give Syrian oil rich Golan heights to Israel & forbid other nations to uphold Iran #nucleardeal. Human rights violations by Israel are ignored. That's a highway to disaster

6365 2018-06-27 12:26:03 One palm oil company has destroyed an area of forest half the size of Paris. 

PepsiCo, Mars, Nestle, Unilever - companies that have promised not to buy palm oil from forest destroyers - are all supporting the destruction.

That needs to stop.

Even if we produced all of our oil we would still be subject to world markets and prices.

6628 2018-06-27 11:49:07 That was the point I was going to make. That fat is a catalyst which is why it doesn't need to be so nutrient dense or why you need to pick one fat over another all the time because of nutrient density. You could probably compete with lard by adding cod liver oil with coconut oil
6629 2018-06-27 11:49:04 I'm 22 but only now learning how to paint my nails now. 
oil painting was easier than this

6633 2018-06-27 11:48:38 Por lògica habría d ser al revés, el gas oil más caro, i hacer descuento por gasoil professional  a los vehículos d transporte q cumplan con la norma más actualizada
6634 2018-06-27 11:48:33 The only Scandinavian country with significant oil reserves is Norway, and yet Sweden and Denmark are consistently rated among the happiest and most equal nations on earth. Try again.
6635 2018-06-27 11:48:26 CBD use is great. But hemp derived CBD is being sold as a cure all. Be a smart consumer and do your research, snake oil salesman are just that. Also, it works much better with THC therapy included. A synergistic effect with CBD+THC.
6636 2018-06-27 11:48:16 Just another way to profit off those who are suffering. Sadly, many will waste their money thinking new snake oil better than old snake oil. @reversechapter @ravensspirit68

6638 2018-06-27 11:47:46 Hi Henok, what does the study show in terms of environmental impact for drilling natural oil?  I'd hate for chemical used for drilling to leak into the ground ruining ground water and arable land.  I really would like to know where I can find the report on this. Help?
6639 2018-06-27 11:47:46 The rupee rupee may slump to a new low this year amid global policy uncertainties. A weak rupee against the US$ makes imports costlier. Some imports cannot be cut down such as oil, which can negatively affect Sri Lanka's current account deficit #lka

6642 2018-06-27 11:47:21 Look in to Botox. A friend of mine owns a clinic that has had very good results. Also CBD oil is a way to go as well. I know many that are doing that with great results as well. If you need a referral, PM me. Hope you feel better :)
6643 2018-06-27 11:47:18 Sorry, the Best Oil to Cook With Is Still Pennzoil.

6645 2018-06-27 11:47:16 To be honest Alan you lost me there. It's hardly Mcdonalds either.
I understand the frustration with the delays but I'm more than happy to wait. 
I find  the whole Weald concept extremely exciting.
6646 2018-06-27 11:47:12 Trump places a restraint on Iranian oil. Prices remain high. The Kremlin is happy. Moscow don’t need Iran (nor Eastern Ukraine). It is all bargaining tools from Kremlin playbook. And, for Moscow everything relating to the West and especially America is zero sum game. Everything!
6647 2018-06-27 11:46:53 Gagii may olive oil akong sandigan. Hahahaha
6648 2018-06-27 11:46:49 No collusion according to Trump but then a Summit with Vladimir Putin. Russia is selling oil to North Korea and the tariff are causing jobs to go across the ocean: is Trump helping Americans or someone else? And about the money well Trump certainly isn't hurting..
6649 2018-06-27 11:46:46 Scandinavian countries have the benefit of huge oil reserves they can leverage against and a relatively smaller population density which creates a much lower drag on infrastructure. 
 And a number of their socialist programs have been unmitigated failures. See: UBI experiment
6650 2018-06-27 11:46:38 I even made my oil change appointment at 7 am so I wouldn’t miss the game. & then this happens to me

6661 2018-06-27 11:45:20 So why the minimal role of Egypt? The Egyptian AF played a key role in Haftar's retaking of the Oil Crescent in March 2017 (as well as losing it when they didn't provide the LNA air support against BDB two weeks before).
6662 2018-06-27 11:44:26 Congrats to @McGeehanJohn and the international team behind this work. An #enzyme that could help turn #plantwaste into #useful things like nylon #bioplastic carbonfibre reducing dependency on oil
6663 2018-06-27 11:44:16 Oh, of course! The PEOPLE of #Iran (just like #Iraq '02 & #Libya '11) would LOVE THE U.S.A ! to come in, kill half their countryfolk, crumble their ancient history/modern infrastructure, control their oil (as now w/ allies #Iraq & #Syria), & decide #regimechange.

6664 2018-06-27 11:44:08 Maybe , I pray God blesses the North with oil so they can leave this country alone

6666 2018-06-27 11:44:06 When someone runs as a socialist and gets elected in America you should worry a bit it shows our country being further divided and right now America is sick and very split almost civil war split..this only pushes that closer 
If you pray now is the time, if you don’t then start!
6667 2018-06-27 11:43:55 So instead of eating them raw or fresh, we should cook them in oil and then consume them?
6668 2018-06-27 11:43:49 As there will be even or fair distribution. By the time people still land you cannot expect them the distribute oil contracts.
6669 2018-06-27 11:43:48 Bashir now suffers from a problem in foreign exchange so he seeks to complete this agreement to benefit from oil transit money ... in any case كسم البشير
6670 2018-06-27 11:43:24 Say what you will about Haftir’s handing over of oil crescent to eastern government - but it’s the biggest shock to the status quo for some time.

It’ll be fascinating to see the ramifications play out from  a purely academic perspective
6671 2018-06-27 11:43:21 Umeongeza oil kwa maji sasa!
6672 2018-06-27 11:43:17 At this important occasion, Iranians need support from President Trump. You should help to overthrow&uproot this regime and never negotiate with them because they are not reformable &untrustworthy. The new oil sanctions will weaken the regime either financially or politically.
6673 2018-06-27 11:43:15 しごとにもーどろ
6674 2018-06-27 11:42:53 True, and everything processed has rancid vegetable oil in it. It’s a ubiquitous stressor and so very hard to avoid I agree. I have gb and pancreas trouble too, though not cancer yet (fingers crossed) and I can’t digest unsaturated fatty foods. Indian, swimming in oil being worst
6675 2018-06-27 11:42:49 Castor Oil beshyy
6676 2018-06-27 11:42:49 Heid...actually wells are drilled ahead of schedule...under budget and shareholders make a profit. This is not the real  ‘oiley world’.
6677 2018-06-27 11:42:48 It just happens on the odd occasion, oil seed usually sets it off. Think I’ll just work in the evening when it’s cooler.
6678 2018-06-27 11:42:31 Your lips on your Dp, I fvck with some of your tweets on a level deeper than crude oil so that shows your mind is pretty too. But what do I know?  I’m a “worthless “man and I’m scummy
6679 2018-06-27 11:42:12 It may also stabilize prices of Oil sales, as we enter into an ever-expanding trade war with the sociopath in the White House, but hey let's pretend that doesn't matter, keep shipping by rail, keep selling to only 1 country & watch the swift and painful death of the Oil industry
6680 2018-06-27 11:42:01 Automakers who don’t comply with emission controls or lie won’t face any penalties. He’s reduced protections of and reduced # of endangered species, 94% of fed/tribal lands were protected but he changed that to allow 90% to open for oil/gas drilling.

6707 2018-06-27 11:39:34 Are those liabilities ultimately in USD or in goods?  Ie - does Saudi owe its citizens a monthly check or does it owe them goods & svcs?  Where are those goods made?  US or China?  How long must US weaponize USD until China says “sell us oil in CNY & use CNY to buy goods”?
6708 2018-06-27 11:39:32 People think oil is about to run out, so it hikes up value, Wars are a great way to make people believe that.
6709 2018-06-27 11:39:16 Oil and water do not mix, as we all know.　　みんなが知っているように，油と水は混ざらない。
6710 2018-06-27 11:39:15 Big business, aka government, will continue to avoid talking about the one thing that has the biggest impact on the environment.

Why? Because drugs keep people in a state of sickness and oil is perceived as essential and both make money.

Veggies are good for health not profit.

6729 2018-06-27 11:35:34 Buhari should not be blamed. Obasanjo is the problem.if they discovered crude oil in northern Nigeria today they will be the first to asked for restructuring.

6730 2018-06-27 11:35:29 I have growers using crop oil and AMS with liberty in your experience would that create cupping?
6731 2018-06-27 11:35:16 Lavender essential oil, if you don't like the smell of it blend it with may chang or neroli, they're sweet and citrusy without being too uplifting if you're looking to relax. Rub it on lightbulbs, or put a few drops on a tissue and put it in your pillowcase. Great for headaches.

6742 2018-06-27 11:34:34 India wants to get closer to the US but it is becoming difficult and New Delhi is not in the mood to either stop Iran oil purchases or strategic weapon systems like the S400 from Russia. in a few years "who lost India" could be a good PHD topic.

6744 2018-06-27 11:34:11 Yes, same. For me vegetable oils interrupt my menstrual cycles making them much longer and exposing me to much higher (read detrimental) levels of estrogen, as well as suppressing oxidative metabolism at the cellular level. Now I use only butter & coconut oil & v little olive oil

6760 2018-06-27 11:32:11 When oil will get over, scientists have not so far claimed end to fossil fuel wars,
But when alternate energy comes, alter war strategy will emerge
6761 2018-06-27 11:32:01 The willingness of KSA to receive CNY for oil is directly related to its ability to get out of CNY to fund those liabilities. And I agree US consumers will bear the brunt of their own lack of savings, probably through currency weakness and inflation. But that's another story.

6776 2018-06-27 11:29:56 What are they trying to achieve, i thought they were trying to keep oil prices down.
6777 2018-06-27 11:29:49 Depends on the nature of the crisis-if its political and perceived temporary oil pricemight be a good thing. The 1970s made profitable Siberia-Gulf of Mexico-Alaska-North Sea etc-if its perceived to be long lasting GDP sacrifices must be made until renewables are  massified

6781 2018-06-27 11:28:40 OPEC agreed to increase production, and oil prices keep rising. A barrel of WTI for August delivery was $71.09 by  5:50 a.m. Eastern Time spurred by concerns over supply worry.
6782 2018-06-27 11:28:35 I have not said it does not matter what currency anyone trades in. Trade is trade. What matters is what you do with the imbalance afterwards. My original point was that if KSA sold oil in CNY, it had to get out of a lot of CNY as it had obligations not denominated in CNY.
6783 2018-06-27 11:28:18 Polish Oil & Gas Company (PGNiG) and Venture Global LNG have entered into an agreement relating to the terms of delivery of LNG from Calcasieu Pass LNG and Plaquemines LNG facilities. #oott

6825 2018-06-27 11:23:28 He was so right! Oil has being the failing of many Arab countries, one of the main reasons why they are consumers not producers ... If only that wealth and resources were used well
6826 2018-06-27 11:23:23 I don't doubt that Russia has a stronger domestic economic reason to seek higher production. But I also think they will see political dividends vis-a-vis their export destinations if Iranian supplies drop. Question is whether Russia cares about oil sales or the JCPOA more.

7028 2018-06-27 10:53:07 It is the opposite - high oil prices could impact midterms, so for GOP it makes sense to move any events that could cause oil price rise either just before or after midterms.

7038 2018-06-27 10:51:36 The real rub will come Nov 1 when India has to stop Iranian oil or face US sanctions. India is heavily dependent  on oil imports and will have to seek alternatives. Must be on the agenda for 2+2 talks in the next few weeks.

7052 2018-06-27 10:49:14 3 of these 4 senators are from “Big Oil” states, TX and OK. Wonder if they are in their pocket. Hell, they may even have made the pants. Oh, and let’s not forget, Oklahoman Scott Pruitt, our EPA Chief. Another denier. What an obvious joke. Just not funny. Ugly. Shameful.

7062 2018-06-27 10:48:17 So energy stocks $OIH are trading at the same levels as last Monday, when oil $CL bottomed 63.40. except oil is over 71 today. Someone is wrong, and until I see lower lows in oil I'm gonna play the imbalance that people got too bearish and need to chase

7072 2018-06-27 10:46:21 A suggestion to hasten the process is to use our existing oil structure and repurpose it. Pipelines can be repurposed to storm hardened electrical grid conduits and nuclear power plants built to join and generate the noncarbon electrical generation.
7073 2018-06-27 10:46:16 Grand, it's like, from the internet, so it's not an old family recipe or anything!

7085 2018-06-27 10:45:08 Although PO use in non food is important, the wider issue is that palm oil is used as an ingredient in almost every processed cake, biscuit and bread item across all supermarkets. Revolting behaviour and a compete ban is well overdue.

7307 2018-06-27 10:01:26 Granted. But Europe is economically incapable of following us there. They have always been far too dependent on imported oil and Iran is a major source for them. We'd basically be asking them to pay twice as much for fuel that is already very expensive, and put up with shortages.

7311 2018-06-27 10:00:55 You’re over-stretching definitional boundaries to justified a misplaced claim. Drug money, as illustrated by your example, often doesn’t come back at all or doesn’t remain there, it’s part of the informal economy & it cannot be equaled to govt owned oil resources in petro states.

Could be faulty oil pump. Or, as @princesstehangi mentioned, the sensor which connects to the warning light is faulty.
7385 2018-06-27 09:47:35 You know what to do ,but you're economic interest is getting in the way of your decision. Divide Nigeria, it don't stop you access to oil, it doesn't stop your economic aspirations, rather it secures & boost economic confidence. Referendum is human right. #Biafra.

7388 2018-06-27 09:47:12 If you’re going to lose money by restocking, why would you do it? You’d sell other things.

And oil production would (and does) go up because demand at that price exists at the time. Increased production then pushes prices down.

7435 2018-06-27 09:37:50 Can you please explain to me how can US “force” Europe to take their Iran oil imports to zero, considering their commitment to do what they can to salvage the JCPOA, and I think buying Iran oil is the least they can do.

7837 2018-06-27 08:26:09 If the use of the oil revenue went into the education of our young ones, I think it's good. That, though, doesn't mean that we should focus on only education and ignore the other sectors - Alexander Abban  #BreakfastDaily
7838 2018-06-27 08:25:28 Looks like the oil's run out again
7839 2018-06-27 08:25:20 So sugar price once again has increased from Ksh 100 to ksh 120.

Cooking oil (Uto) from Ksh 140-160.

Tomorrow its Unga price. Why can't they increase prices of useless stuff like bear, cigarette, these kind of things that aren't essential!

7843 2018-06-27 08:24:46 I may be miles off here but I reckon it probably has something to do with Oil and money. Crazy huh?
7844 2018-06-27 08:24:37 Yep, face mask your vagina and use marula oil to moisturise, less ingrown hair marks
7845 2018-06-27 08:24:33 Just had to book a full AA inspection of my car because the local garage has had it for a total of 5 weeks, they've had £1050 out of my pocket and it's still come back with an engine warning light, an oil warning light and is smoking if it's driven for more than 10mins. FUN!
7846 2018-06-27 08:24:32 @StreetSignsCNBC @CNBCJou : The US is threatening countries with sanctions if they don't stop importing Iranian oil by November!!!

7848 2018-06-27 08:23:42 EPA SEEKS MODEST BIOFUEL INCREASE: The Trump administration is proposing to modestly increase the amount of ethanol and other biofuels that the nation's oil refiners have to blend into the gasoline and diesel they sell.

Because india secretly heavy purchase oil from iran in indian rupee value, this is cheating to USA,and violate international trade and plan to supply lot of crush missiles to Iran, it is danger to US peoples.

7876 2018-06-27 08:19:46 Welcome. If you've come with the aim to dissuade India from buying Iranian oil or cooperate with Iran on #Chhabahar, you're wasting time. Iranian oil and Chhabahar are both important to India.
7877 2018-06-27 08:19:43 Should we move away from calling data the new oil? @tinholt disagrees and presents oil as a zero-sum game, whereas data fuels the economy, enabling a paradigm shift. #datainnovation @ecipe
7878 2018-06-27 08:19:34 Nonsense. You are a fool if you believe that. We subsidise rUK. The figures stating we outperform England were in the FT. Post Brexit? We all suffer but we can escape that. Seen the price of oil lately? That’s why they need us. No country that took independence has ever failed.

7979 2018-06-27 08:02:00 Ah! It is a misleading because I work on GIS mapping of palm oil mills of global consumer brands, but I also use "map" to mean suppliers->end user. Dr Bronner's has a very simple PO supply chain, just one related company, one CPO mill.  So "I mapped it" was a bit cheeky of me.

Democratic socialism aims to combine democracy and socialism (as per the name), so you have programs like single payer healthcare or a nationalized industry like oil.

8236 2018-06-27 07:12:14 In ChinaTown, the spas flush lots of baby wipes (and condoms). Also the restaurants use a LOT of oil. The council should heavily subsidise assistance on oil disposal. The drains are totally dried up. And it STINKS
8237 2018-06-27 07:12:07 *one day of not washing my hair* Julian: did you put olive oil or something in your hair? 
Me: no.. and why would I put olive oil in my hair? My hair is just greasy, thanks for noticing. 
8238 2018-06-27 07:11:58 Good move by gov’t to ensure that Ugandans benefit from the oil and gas sector. However, there is need to walk the talk. Gov’t should not only legislate local content but also prepare host communities and Ugandans at large to seize the opportunities the sector presents.
8239 2018-06-27 07:11:56 What is the relation of peace agreement with Sudan securing oil fields in South Sudan using all necessary step in cordination of the Owner of the house ! Blank check Sudan’s security organ to take over oil fields without agile bullet !
8240 2018-06-27 07:11:46 Since @MBuhari became President of Nigeria, Peace and security has returned to Ogba Egbema Ndoni Lga, the largest oil producer in Rivers state. Those who killed families on new year day and enjoyed R/state govt pardon, were wiped out by FG and my people are happy.

8247 2018-06-27 07:10:47 Did you know? Aidan Heavey, the former CEO of Tullow Oil Plc, the company that has been at the forefront of oil exploration in Uganda over the last 10 years, was an accountant in Ireland who quit his job in the mid 1980s and decided to buy abandoned oil wells in Senegal.

8321 2018-06-27 06:55:26 Oil partly but the main rise in oil price has happened in the last 6 months. Inflation spiked well before that due to, as you said, the weak pound caused by brexit which increased import costs, which was passed on to consumer.

8361 2018-06-27 06:48:00 Agreed. Thank you Andrew. Oil companies have spent millions upon millions convincing people that climate change is a hoax. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if we someday learn there is a Russian style troll farm funded by oil to misinform people on social media.
8362 2018-06-27 06:47:52 I was too impatient to wait to buy eucalyptus oil for my aroma diffuser so I used melted vicks  hey it me, an idiot lol

8368 2018-06-27 06:46:24 It was previously discussed in the bilateral talks in Nov 2017, where a number of MOUs were signed in which both Sudan and South Sudan would work together to resume production in defunct Unity State oil fields.

8370 2018-06-27 06:46:22 Did you know? The first oil well to be drilled in Uganda was Waki in Butiaba in Western Uganda. The well was drilled in 1938.
8371 2018-06-27 06:46:13 holly dead ass put vegetable oil on as chapstick 
8372 2018-06-27 06:45:58 Did I miss the protests against oil industry socialism?
8373 2018-06-27 06:45:54 And you're right we do get a say and we say this man is only helping the super rich and the only regulations he has cut have benefited large corporations and oil/coal companies small business owners are still fucked. Which comes as no surprise to me whatsoever
8374 2018-06-27 06:45:37 Oh, Lordy. The CO Gov race is gonna be expensive this season.

Polis has money. He’s using it. But he also wants Oil&Gas to have to be good citizens. No drilling in neighborhoods or under public parks/schools/hospitals & must maintain their infrastructure.

I bet Oil spends $20M.
8375 2018-06-27 06:45:36 I thought we only get about 10% of our oil from Iran, not a small amount I agree and on good terms but hardly crippling surely?
8376 2018-06-27 06:45:32 Thanks but don't tell us about Iranian oil imports. It's our internal business. No need of ur governments advice. Better to keep it with urself.
8377 2018-06-27 06:45:23 They're also in the best position to secure the oil as they've always wanted to do. Nothing will convince me Bish Bish is the best yall found to do this!
8378 2018-06-27 06:45:21 The US has been energy independent for like 8 years now so we don't need Saudi Arabia for oil like we once did. US is still strategic allies with Saudis because you can't move money and weapons and hire mercenaries in the Middle East without going through them.

8380 2018-06-27 06:45:16 And yet all of them killed huge swaths of people without any input from the people. When people in the US voted they were never given a vote on killing off the secular government of Iran to help out oil companies. We never got a vote on killing off the government of Chile etc.
8381 2018-06-27 06:45:00 Important to understand the tradeoffs of palm vs. other oils for land. Should we trade 9 acres of Canadian prairie (i.e. for rapeseed oil) for 1 acre of Borneo rainforest? Depends on carbon, species loss, local political concerns, et cetera...
8382 2018-06-27 06:44:44 I’m too drunk to answer and respond to this properly!

8389 2018-06-27 06:43:21 Did you know? Irene Batebe is the youngest female top government official in Uganda's oil industry. At less than 40 years old, she is the chairperson of the Uganda Refinery Holding Company and also Acting Commissioner, Midstream, at the Petroleum Directorate.

8395 2018-06-27 06:41:47 India should ask Oil for 25$ barrel price for next 25 years if US wants it to stop the trade.
8396 2018-06-27 06:41:46 Palm oil is also disastrous for human health.

8398 2018-06-27 06:41:13 Gas stations live to milk you when gas prices are dropping. Big oil always puts the screws to California, its largest maker, and jacks the prices up here. As oil prices drop, gas prices follow at a lagged pace to extract profits from you and I.

8409 2018-06-27 06:39:57 How broken is the #GOP? Saudi is not listed on Trump's travel ban.. Remember 9/11? Yeah? Bush Jr. sent troops to Iraq (nothing 2 do w. 9/11/2001) & could never find #BinLaden. The guy hid in plain sight w. WIVES AND KIDS. Oil rules #America NOT morality.=
8410 2018-06-27 06:39:06 Oil consumption is increasing faster than renewables in energy equivalents and in absolute terms. You are talking theory... I'm talking practice.
8411 2018-06-27 06:38:51 There was little 'recovery' when Mrs Thatcher was in power. The £ was valued highly because of North Sea oil, the revenues from which were spent on social security payments. So called stagflation led to falling real wages. Started under Labour but likely worsened by Conservatives
8412 2018-06-27 06:38:49 In these dry conditions, sometimes the engine breathers get blocked with dust and grime. This can lead to a build up of oil pressure in the block and force oil out of normally tight seals. 
That would be my first check.

8416 2018-06-27 06:38:07 Why don't you call for immediate scrapping of all subsidies to biodiesel #biofuels ? Artificial policy driven demand for vegetable oil is the one part of the problem you can solve at a stroke of a pen. We need solutions. Some are actually simple.
8417 2018-06-27 06:38:06 #SQZ aren't importing Iranian oil are they? I think the drop yesterday was due to this news. But I think the work around last time will be back in play.
8418 2018-06-27 06:38:02 I compare it the war in Afghanistan after 9/11. While yes, the government might’ve done it for profits in oil and whatnot. The people actually doing the fighting were there for different reasons. Same with civil war. Different reasons for different classes of people.
8419 2018-06-27 06:37:31 I’d like to give a thanks to the stripper that told me she uses baby oil after showers to make her skin super soft. Because of you now MY skin is super soft. Also thank you for the job offer but I kindly had to decline, love ya girl.
8420 2018-06-27 06:37:24 Did you read the linked article? For example this bit: "Eliminating the use of oil and gas will cut about 13% from the world’s energy budget because mining, transporting, and refining those fuels are all energy-intensive activities"

8494 2018-06-27 06:24:43 But then, of course, in maritime circles in Rijeka, “bunker” means filling up a ship’s tanks with fuel :-) Not an oil tanker, mind, a regular ship that burns oil for fuel.
8495 2018-06-27 06:24:34 Fuel is expensive globally  right now ma'am. Crude oil production having been affected esp Iran which is one of the biggest oil producers was slammed with sanctions by the U.S. which consequently has impacted greatly on their oil export flexibility. Let's stick to facts.

8515 2018-06-27 06:19:44 I use the Essano Argan Oil shampoo conditioner, and leave in oil, tie it back/braid it and let it air dry. It's only $10-$15 a bottle (depending where you get it) and it works just as well as the fancy stuff!! The oil is also good for between washes when it's getting a bit dry

8566 2018-06-27 06:11:23 Trump team is living in a fool's paradise: It yesterday demanded that other nations stop buying Iranian oil by Nov. 4 or face sanctions. Days of such diktats are long gone. However, US unilateralism is imposing costs on others: Oil prices, in reaction, jumped nearly 4% yesterday.

8902 2018-06-27 05:08:18 Why are these anti-science Trumpsters so determined to bury climate science?  Answer:  Big OIL money.
It doesn't matter that the renewable energy industry is booming, Big Oil has deeper pockets.
Plus the fact Trumpsters are scientifically illiterate conspiracy nut climate deniers

9030 2018-06-27 04:46:23 Socialism...the “people” MUST be kept EQUAL but in POVERTY so that the ruling class can remain wealthy. History teaches us this.  Milennials...understand this...understand the history of socialism...today...simply look at a RICH ͏o͏i͏l country like Venezuela.  Life sucks there !!
9031 2018-06-27 04:46:14 My 2012 Audi is a complete piece of shit:

- New timing chain at 76k ($$$)
- Faulty intake runner valve ($1200)
- An oil leak somewhere
- Faulty break pad wear sensor throwing a light
- Now faulty PCV tripping low oil pressure light, pressure is OK
9032 2018-06-27 04:46:13 Nissin tonkotsu ramen with black garlic oil for late lunch. Kind of a guilty pleasure.
9033 2018-06-27 04:46:01 Kinda think he wanted to show up Putin with this Space Force bs. Pretty sure Putin is the only other country with a military branch of the same name. But stupid Trump doesn't even understand the purpose of the mission. He just markets snake oil.

9036 2018-06-27 04:45:37 Why would the US trade with countries that have nothing to offer?  They won’t even invade a country that has no oil, or get militarily involved.
9037 2018-06-27 04:45:26 お。パネライで反応するとは岸君やるな？
9038 2018-06-27 04:45:14 I’m sure this would also inspire them to wash their hands. 

Seeing literal oil fingerprints on your bun...
9039 2018-06-27 04:45:12 How hot does it have to have been in your house for the Vick salve and Coconut oil to melt?!
9040 2018-06-27 04:45:06 今！
9041 2018-06-27 04:45:04 Precisely my point also, most of the products we consume if not all are imported. Fluctuation in oil prices nowadays directly affects foreign currency rates. Unless we produce our own products inflation is way out of control. We don't produce much here but babies... 1/2

9047 2018-06-27 04:43:27 #India Open: Indices again nudged higher, despite a lower cue from SGX Futures board & from Asian majors. #RBI again flags worrisome stats of #NPA's beleaguering the Indian Banking system. Oil/allied sectors may see increased activity. Defence may be in focus on US/Russia angle.

9055 2018-06-27 04:42:37 Loathe getting my oil changed. It's like time I will never get back.
9056 2018-06-27 04:42:29 How long can I go without changing my oil
9057 2018-06-27 04:42:13 普通に可愛すぎ
9058 2018-06-27 04:41:59 Enjoy that opioid epidemic then. And forcing kids whose only way to stop epileptic seizures is OIL, not even pot, to move to Colorado. 

Anyway, aren’t you an Okie? 
9059 2018-06-27 04:41:48 Odd how Trans Mountain Pipeline and Westridge Terminal have been operating for 65+ years, and not one single tanker mishap. Also odd how you pay no attention whatsoever to the 260+ tankers/yr. coming down the coast from Alaska? Guess you're just paid to sabotage Canadian oil?
9060 2018-06-27 04:41:40 Man that oil popping is no joke I tell ya
9061 2018-06-27 04:41:28 i love it when recipes call for a fck ton of white pepper, peppercorn, and chili oil in the sauce......and then at the end they SPRINKLE ON EVEN MORE ON TOP OF THE DISH!!!! THE ABSOLUTE MAD MEN!!!! TY FOR BEING SO GOOD!!

9064 2018-06-27 04:40:49 I knew Trump wasn't one of them when he refused a war in Syria for an oil pineline. And when he refused a war in North Korea for NK's heavy metal resources. Either war would've drug Russia and/or China into it, and would've killed millions. Trump chose peace.

9071 2018-06-27 04:39:33 Buy whole almonds. Lay out on a baking pan. Put in oven for about 7-10 min at 400 degrees. Take out. Let cool just a little. Put in Tupperware bowl. Sprinkle olive oil and salt on em. Shake. Cover and in the morning they just RIGHT 
9072 2018-06-27 04:39:09 Christians against a plant that was designed by God right? What’s the argument? I’ve never touched the stuff until I tried CBD oil, and it helped me tremendously. I’m not for people getting high, but there is something to the benefits. High CBD, low as possible THC, I’m for it.

9074 2018-06-27 04:38:34 back in the day, I was talking with a guy who was handling the Frackwater placements for Big Oil companies in Oklahoma and I said "The middle of America is going to fall in the Ocean." he laughed and said "Yes. But not in our lifetime." and I thought, "you have no idea."

9078 2018-06-27 04:38:21 I have the realest insomnia sometimes and I know tonight is gonna be one of them nights so I just took half a Valium and then applied organic lavender essential oil to my wrists and temples because life is all about balance, babes. 
9079 2018-06-27 04:38:18 bought some tea tree oil today so hopefully my life will start coming together soon
9080 2018-06-27 04:38:00 Aren't you clever! But naive. Being on a college campus does not obviate the security protocols for approaching high-ranking government officials, especially not when members of Congress recently made statements that some have interpreted as a call to violence.
9081 2018-06-27 04:37:30 Leak oil like a sieve.
9082 2018-06-27 04:37:26 This oil diffuser has been the best investment.
9083 2018-06-27 04:37:20 You niggas work at the oil refinery that’s where I ain’t tryna be.
9084 2018-06-27 04:37:19 Coconut oil really the best way to take makeup off idc
9085 2018-06-27 04:37:18 Thank you gas and oil industry inspire Wolf and Peduto best efforts to destroy it.
9086 2018-06-27 04:37:10 Legalizing pot. Raising taxes on oil companies. Liberalizing liquor and sports gambling laws. The dinosaurs are finally starting to die in Oklahoma. Maybe by the time I die I'll be proud of this shithole.
9087 2018-06-27 04:36:42 Like Chavez the first time
9088 2018-06-27 04:36:17 Yes I love to oil them up after my shower
9089 2018-06-27 04:35:48 ありがとウルトラございます
9090 2018-06-27 04:35:28 FINALLY GOT THE SALAD:

salad mix, with kale
300g of thin sliced salmon / tuna
baby tomatoes
artichoke hearts
heart of palm
avocado
bell peppers
whole onion (sweet?)
tbs olive oil
fake lemon juice
"salad seasoning"
garlic salt
9091 2018-06-27 04:35:22 So "hard working taxpayers" don't mind their money going to subsidizing massively successful oil companies and keeping failing coal and nuclear power afloat? I get you service your donors but even for you this is pathetic.
9092 2018-06-27 04:34:50 Because funerals & death in general costs so much can I told my parents to be as cheap as possible. So just put me in a box, burn it & put my ashes in an empty coconut oil jar. 

They’re now in the kitchen discussing how weird I am.
9093 2018-06-27 04:34:49 The base of the left doesnt  just simply disagree with the right, they hate them. You are literally a Nazi to them and we all know what a Nazi deserves.  This can't end well
9094 2018-06-27 04:34:44 @lawrence.  Wish you would have clarified that AMF had manufactured the oil leaking scoots, and it was after a group of management including Willie G and others who pooled their $$ and bought the company back.  THAT is why the mc was improved.
9095 2018-06-27 04:34:41 “Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
9096 2018-06-27 04:34:27 I went to cvs to get three items: cleanser, moisturizer, and oil. Cvs only had the moisturizer but I saw online the Walmart had it for $3 cheaper and was less than 5 mins away so I left.

9100 2018-06-27 04:33:41 Oh I am too old for them to harass; with older women it’s a special kinda hate.
9101 2018-06-27 04:33:34 If their goal is to impact  the other oil producers market share why don’t we retaliate by imposing tariffs on their product coming into Canada?
9102 2018-06-27 04:33:34 They may never even record a statement, they are the most protected family in Kenya today, the media spins the story to duty free sugar at the mention of Rai while all along it was poisonous sugar. All trees in Kenya belong to Rai, Cooking oil Rai, Sugar Rai. IT'S TOUGH
9103 2018-06-27 04:33:31 Sure it is. Just like the fallacy that the oil industry couldn't possibly survive without $billions in subsidies.
9104 2018-06-27 04:33:30 I love coconut oil 
9105 2018-06-27 04:33:25 #Rupee hits 19-month low against US dollar as #Crude oil prices rise, opens at 68.42/$

9107 2018-06-27 04:32:34 olive oil does wonders
9108 2018-06-27 04:32:30 I do too sis. Try using black soap as a face wash at night with a witch hazel toner and tea tree oil as a spot treatment
9109 2018-06-27 04:32:20 I need my oil changed 
9110 2018-06-27 04:32:17 Keep dreaming and making your next move based on Commodore 64 software.
9111 2018-06-27 04:32:15 In this equalization dog whistle argument, I'd like to see someone point out the billions in big oil subsidies Ottawa has footed.

9114 2018-06-27 04:31:41 This sounds weird but I run through my lashes with a clean spoolie with water then top it with oil so my lashes won't clump up after I do my eye makeup. A plus of doing it that I found is powder won't stick to your lashes and they grow because of the oil.
9115 2018-06-27 04:31:33 Need my scalp massaged with some olive oil
9116 2018-06-27 04:30:45 But they were smart and banked most of the oil boom.  They will have solvency for generations because their politicians work for their people, not for themselves.
9117 2018-06-27 04:30:41 Fresh -Rose deep hydration face cream & Drunk Elephant-Marula Oil. I use that oil for my fine lines that you probably don’t have yet lol but I’ve noticed they’re not as noticable as before.
9118 2018-06-27 04:30:39 Olive oil.
9119 2018-06-27 04:30:24 The U.S. threatened to slap sanctions on countries that don’t cut oil imports from #Iran to “zero” by November 4. #WTI immediately jumped on the news at $70.53 a barrel.
9120 2018-06-27 04:30:20 More tankers.
9121 2018-06-27 04:30:16 @RalphNortham @GovernorVA I am so happy w/ the direction u r taking our State! Pulling the National Guard from the Boarder was Morally the right thing to do! Making Medical Marijuana & CBD oil legal in the State was another! Doctors r already suggesting it 2 patients 4 pain!!!
9122 2018-06-27 04:29:56 .Just glad my side has the guns, oil and most of the food.

9126 2018-06-27 04:29:20 Just wanted to point out that I live in Alberta, an oil-and-gas driven Canadian province that tracks centre/centre-right. We have universal healthcare and a $15/hr minimum wage. “Far-left” 
9127 2018-06-27 04:29:15 I just did in my other tweets to you. I showed you how Venezuela's GDP started it's huge fall right when the world price of oil had a HISTORIC drop. You just ignore data. Anyone can read it for themselves.
9128 2018-06-27 04:29:14 Study is wrong....if you want real numbers talk to companies operating in oil patch....This is Canadian lifeline...

9131 2018-06-27 04:28:50 Oil prices will come down by 10 to 12 rs per once petrol diesel is put into GST. And thats slated to happen in a year or less. And the increased price public is paying is not going into Modi's pocket. India paid back the Iran debt of oil of UPA times with that.

I make a good ass salad now with kale, apples, walnuts, lemon garlic , olive oil, & aged cheddar. I could eat that everyday — sometimes throw grills chix on that bih 
9134 2018-06-27 04:28:33 I have a biggest bro award, contraband, an oil diffuser, inhaler, lighters, glasses and b bops ?????
9135 2018-06-27 04:27:33 I’m for full legalization actually, but that’s not an option right now. I’m for MM because I’m for helping people with very serious medical conditions that CBD oil can’t help. I’ve seen children get multiple CT scan a month and injected with Ativan to stop their seizures, I know
9136 2018-06-27 04:27:28 olive oil
9137 2018-06-27 04:27:23 No it didn't. You're repeating a talking point. I showed the biggest factor in Venezuela's economy (that being oil). You're a hack and troll. Run along now.
9138 2018-06-27 04:27:21 Stock up on oil lamps and Colman lanterns that can burn anything. Colman

9146 2018-06-27 04:26:15 The Venezuela crises initiated in 2012. Way before the oil prices went down. Chaves was still alive.
9147 2018-06-27 04:26:00 I'm a LVT. Edibles are hazardous (due to other ingredients). I do not recommend any form of marijuana without consultation and approval by a veterinarian. There is interest in the oil for seizures and for use in pain, but a lot more research is needed.
9148 2018-06-27 04:25:43 the same people that believe in coconut oil for your face!!
9149 2018-06-27 04:24:50 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
9150 2018-06-27 04:24:46 im actually glad i changed the oil of my car last week because i had nothing to do, it was like 2 months late to what the dealer told me BUT i don’t have to worry anymore
9151 2018-06-27 04:24:44 Essential oils! Peppermint oil, young living deep relief on temples and down neck
9152 2018-06-27 04:24:31 Rose oil smells so good on me.
9153 2018-06-27 04:24:23 We can't be drilling for oil anymore. 
9154 2018-06-27 04:24:06 Sometimes the podi (powder) is called gun powder - not sure why perhaps if has bit of everything heat, salt, crunchy bits of corse ground dhal but awesome mixed with virgin sesame oil so good - sometimes also smeared inside Mysore masala dosa 
9155 2018-06-27 04:23:56 Think I’m gone get a oil change in the morning, I need it
9156 2018-06-27 04:23:52 baby oil buat colay abis lagi
9157 2018-06-27 04:23:43 Everything. That piece of equipment is a game changer. One tip: a get an olive oil sprayer/mister and spray down any "fried" foods you make.. It helps crisp them up.
9158 2018-06-27 04:23:00 Saudi Arabia values their oil only in USD which keeps your currency stable. Anyone who has common sense would know that this plays a very important role in US dollar's stability. 

Do your research you idiots. I hate the fact that you need an Indian to tell you this. 
Very stupid
9159 2018-06-27 04:22:43 No it didn't. They had good growth (that is when the opposition wasn't intentionally sabotaging things) before the world oil collapse. All their indicators were fine. Their problem was that they depended too much on world oil. Once oil fell, so did their economy.
9160 2018-06-27 04:22:42 I am born of my OIL
9161 2018-06-27 04:22:15 Omg you have never made a mug cake?! It’s a small couple of ounces of cupcake you make in a microwave! You just need flour, sugar, milk, oil, baking powder, vanilla or cocoa powder.
9162 2018-06-27 04:22:07 thought baking soda got rid of the oil
9163 2018-06-27 04:21:54 Is there a country where it works? Very likely the oil rich gulf states but even that is changing.

9165 2018-06-27 04:21:26 I was talking about needing an oil change and like clockwork, got a coupon delivered to my email... coincidence or creepy? Don't care, little blue hasn't had an oil change in a year. 
9166 2018-06-27 04:21:21 Fucking looks like 'Get Out' movie set.
Big Oil is the sunken place.

9169 2018-06-27 04:21:08 Nah the oil masks that.
9170 2018-06-27 04:20:47 If Kiir Mayardit sign that Khartoum document I will join those who hate him. I find it so ludicrous for Beshire to claim custody of #SS oil field.
9171 2018-06-27 04:20:45 well lmao we forgot to change oil so we had to head home and are gonna try this again tomorrow morning
9172 2018-06-27 04:20:32 The oil spill at BP ain't cleaned up
9173 2018-06-27 04:20:31 putting mad oil of oregano in my water to aid digestion cuz i been stress eating; or, actually i been eating trash yeah but my justification is that I'm packing on pounds because food will be sparse next month
9174 2018-06-27 04:20:31 I tried to look for something on your ig to no avail. But that’s dope! Oil painting looks hard but fun.
9175 2018-06-27 04:20:16 I like the olive oil relaxer more than the just for me because the j4m makes my hair stiff the OO one makes my hair silky and bouncy!!
9176 2018-06-27 04:20:02 Doesn't matter, the longer the better we both look like Casper and I have some new tanning oil  whaddupp skin cancer. 
9177 2018-06-27 04:19:57 My hands smell like olive oil 
9178 2018-06-27 04:19:26 None.  They just purchased the snake oil he was selling and they still believe it is an elixir that will cure all their ills.  Eventually they will find out that it’s just snake oil.  But that will take a long, long time due to them having less brain cells than the rest of us.
9179 2018-06-27 04:19:25 なんじゃ？
9180 2018-06-27 04:19:12 オイルbotって何⁇とよく聞かれますが、…オイルはオイルですYO
9181 2018-06-27 04:18:59 I blocked him
9182 2018-06-27 04:18:54 I have tons of oil in my room
9183 2018-06-27 04:18:52 So what??? They used the oil revenue through years funding extremists worldwide, they steal almost everything and they live in luxury while the people are having to eat dogs. That’s the true socialism. Always have been and always will be.
9184 2018-06-27 04:18:51 You don't know what socialism is do ya bud? It's okay if you don't, American propaganda runs deep. Not to mention the media has been representing Venezuela on the verge of collapse to drive a military intervention narrative to secure oil. Crazy what research shows ya.

9196 2018-06-27 04:17:55 Doug, it has been three hours. 
What should the Alberta Heritage Fund invest in? What are the emerging markets that will diversify Alberta's future?

Is oil and gas the only future available to Alberta under a #ucp government?

Could you ask @jkenney on our behalf?#ableg
9197 2018-06-27 04:17:31 be careful with that, we depend on them for oil.

9201 2018-06-27 04:16:55 I only am on these avi drawing but my actual art work is usually realistic stuff with pencil and colored pencil. I just recently starting to move to oil paints.
9202 2018-06-27 04:16:53 Derrick, you are already setting up the excuse about your back being sore. Magnesium? You better squirt some CBD oil on that back and bring a real set of nuts to this fight.
9203 2018-06-27 04:16:30 I’ve been using coconut oil and essential oils :) not too worried tho, just excited to meet my baby!

9207 2018-06-27 04:16:08 Macroeconomic stabilization is ongoing. Growth prospects remain positive, supported by strong oil production. Investor confidence has improved, as indicated by a successful issuance of the Eurobond in May 2018. Inflation has subsided to below 10 percent

9208 2018-06-27 04:16:07 After you take a shower, rub coconut oil on the burn. Then take a clean towel and wipe off the excess off the burn. It will help a lot more than aloe vera.

9244 2018-06-27 04:10:51 The answer to the Maritimes is quit letting them come and wrk in Alberta. Teachers, oil workers et al. That runs their economy. Screw those who hates us but Take are jobs n money.

9248 2018-06-27 04:10:12 TWA went bankrupt after they lost a jet over Long Island Sound.  My guess was they were trying to protect the airlines and Saudi Arabia since we are addicted to the Saudi’s oil.

9252 2018-06-27 04:09:01 She shared the perfume oil she wears on her IG once so I bought it. It smells so sexy. I'm sure it smells better on her than me though. 
9253 2018-06-27 04:09:00 What the do-gooders ignore is the dust reduction realized by pouring the oil in the back lane.  You never hear anything about that!
9254 2018-06-27 04:08:56 How about reservoir tolerant methanogens that can convert irrecoverable oil into methane. We are leaving behind larger oil fields than we will ever find at cessation of production. Transform the oil to methane and blowdown a gas cap. MEOR has so much potential.
9255 2018-06-27 04:08:41 Balancing oil 2 ค่ะ

9257 2018-06-27 04:08:28 Looks like a refinery in middle pic. Is somebody upset we’re producing our own oil and gas now? If we lost prices would spike and we would have to purchase from elsewhere until rebuilt. Possible?

speech, banning books and writers, inciting violence against " others." 
They dont just disagree with you. They hate you.
9269 2018-06-27 04:06:00 Again, the Iranians have already switched currencies and singed deals to trade in local currencies, gold, and even crypto currencies. 
also "Officials have yet to hold talks with China and India, among the largest importers of Iran’s oil, as well as Turkey and Iraq."

9275 2018-06-27 04:05:22 But it also allows for change at the hands of the individual. Like with communism the world is literally controlled by only the top few, and the people have about no influence. Capitalism allows the world be what we make it, and oil mining isn't a necessity for capitalism.
9276 2018-06-27 04:05:17 Hey, can I have some oil, dis bitch is thirsty
9277 2018-06-27 04:05:14 Africa transformation is not in sectors like Oil & Gas, Minerals or Tourism, which grab global headlines, but in AGRICULTURE

9280 2018-06-27 04:05:00 I honestly recommend once every other day. If need be, you can do it once a day. Just make sure you moisturize afterwwards. The oil spot treatment I would say once a week.

9285 2018-06-27 04:04:40 I totally understand and agree. The Oil need to get out of Lucic’s contract one way or another. That’s got to be priority #1
9286 2018-06-27 04:04:26 Im from OK, I didn’t know this was happening!!  So you just need a script and the fk to a dispensary or is it just the cbd oil?

Crude oil prices, supported by Iran supply disruption fears, may rise in the day ahead as US stockpiles contract by more than expected. Gold may fall as USD gains on haven bid...
9292 2018-06-27 04:03:13 Its all going to change anyway. Over the next 10-20 years driverless cars will destroy the oil and gas industry.

9302 2018-06-27 04:01:33 The Alberta oil patch has not bounced back because we have only one customer for our oil, the USA. Since 2015, the US is energy independent & a net exporter of oil. We now sell oil into the US at a deep discount because of over supply in US, that's why we need pipe to tidewater.
9303 2018-06-27 04:01:27 ไปค่ะ สู้
9304 2018-06-27 04:01:22 Not cooking it correctly. My mother used to cook ours, and it was never slimy. Cast iron pan some oil, a little salt. Never leave the pan. Keep stirring and stirring, the slime will cook away. It takes a while, but it's worth it!

9308 2018-06-27 04:01:07 You tell me“building a wall“will make more crimes happen .YOU ASK WHY , LET ME TELL YOU .WALL COST MONEY RIGHT ..where will it come from? You will raise tax, higher gas, oil , and produce .USA  WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT . WE WILL GET NOTHING IN RETURN. THAT SOUNDS SMART .
9309 2018-06-27 04:00:59 Good on you for taking this on and helping spearhead it. There is no perfect solution for a game as physical & fast as hockey but the status quo isn't working. NHL needs  to change and burying their head in the sand is no longer an option.
9310 2018-06-27 04:00:42 Witch hazel & vitamin e oil is really helping my face
9311 2018-06-27 04:00:39 Wasn't a meeting. Just lunch. 
9312 2018-06-27 04:00:36 That means the best driver in the whole circuit won't be at the diamond nationals at Lucas oil speedway when I'm going!!! Ugh
9313 2018-06-27 04:00:21 How can it be 0%  fat when it is made from oil & contains egg yolk?

9317 2018-06-27 04:00:03 I'm jumping in a hot shower to scrub all this make-up off, taking some CBD oil, and watching Schitt's Creek in bed. #lifeisgood
9318 2018-06-27 03:59:50 This should not happen...
9319 2018-06-27 03:59:36 After shave routine: Sandalwood mask (I don't wash my face), toner to even up the skin that didn't hit the sun, extra moisturise with aloe vera cause there's no hair for the oil to stay on. If I feel like it, I'll put neem oil to avoid infections or ingrown hairs. Thank you...
9320 2018-06-27 03:59:32 Umm wrong, you're forgetting the Korean War, you know the 1 right after that? Also you're forgetting Afghanistan had no oil that was a terror attack by Bin Laden. You're thinking gulf war. But hey keep your lies going.
9321 2018-06-27 03:59:16 I’ve put canna oil in my coffee before. It wasn’t fun. CBD with my coffee helped with jitters though.
9322 2018-06-27 03:58:55 Literally only one: John Frieda Frizz Ease Dream Curls Daily Styling Spray (yes I had to google the proper name!). I've also started using Schwartzkopf Extra Care Leave In Treatment and L'Oréal Oil-In-Cream together when my hair is soaking wet.
9323 2018-06-27 03:58:50 It's just flaxseed oil.
9324 2018-06-27 03:58:46 When will you speak up for the starving in Venezuela? Many American socialists supported the totalitarian regime of Chavez and Maduro. Corruption caused nation to dismantle, not oil.
9325 2018-06-27 03:58:39 2. How corrupt red crescent officials are selling large storage areas of such supplies as cooking oil and mattress for profit. This is not to mention all the food that is flooding assad regime controlled areas and being sold in the market. All the while assad employed starvation
9326 2018-06-27 03:58:38 Because I care about my dick energy burning clean, my cock now runs off of vegetable oil donated by a local Arby's.
9327 2018-06-27 03:58:19 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,
because once Kyu incorrectly entered oil when
cooking a simple ham.
9328 2018-06-27 03:58:16 Really? Her policies are us having PUBLIC single payer healthcare, a higher minimum wage, and free public college. That's what every rich first world country in the world has. The US isn't dependent on the world price of oil like Venezuela was. So try that bull shit elsewhere.
9329 2018-06-27 03:58:15 We have the third largest GDP in the country, and our oil, wood, and natural gas production gave our countrie the power it has today, its our liberal PM ruining our hard work. Plus the Grade A alberta beef, rodeo, and hockey help. And yup, you don't know a thing about LIGMA

9333 2018-06-27 03:57:10 Come to Oklahoma, we frack for oil, and give money to the oil companies, but caused more earthquakes than even California....but cheaper gas, with lower paying jobs.
9334 2018-06-27 03:57:10 Good thing I've been working and not watching the Tribe today. Someone drained the oil out of Klubot and sent him out to die. #RallyTogether

9336 2018-06-27 03:56:53 Other big differences: in 2012, shale was on a massive upswing. In 2018 there’s room for growth but limited. In 2012, you didn’t have Angolan, Venezuelan oil declines. In 2012 you didn’t have Saudi, OPEC, IEA warning about impending price spikes after years of underinvestment.
9337 2018-06-27 03:56:46 More than a few strains of cannabis can be helpful in relieving both pain and nausea associated with migraines. CBD oil is also something to look into.

9341 2018-06-27 03:56:07 You nailed it.  Furthermore, the Saudi's and other members of the Oil cartel are not stupid.  They are managing oil supply year to year in an effort to maximize the present value of all future oil cash flows.  There remains lots of money in oil.

9349 2018-06-27 03:54:32 Maddi put a large piece of clean cardboard under where the engine is over night. Check it in the morning. If there are oil drops then you got a leak. If clean, put it back and run car for 10 minutes so the oil is under pressure and check it again.

Odd I’m imaging what it smells like haha.
9355 2018-06-27 03:52:58 Making India, Turkey and China also go to zero is a pretty big difference. Obama’s sanctions cut Iranian exports by 1 million barrels a day. This would cut them by 2 million barrels a day or more. That seems massive for a tight oil market.

9375 2018-06-27 03:49:10 ああオイル、どうして君はオイルなんだ…
9376 2018-06-27 03:49:09 Yes, Protein Powder, Super-Nutrition, Spirulina, Compound Marrow, Pine Pollen, Calcium, Joint Health, Deep Sea Fish Oil, Zinc (the guys who train lose a lot of iron so these are the best). Partners can add.
9377 2018-06-27 03:48:56 I’m a Floridian - born & raised in Miami, living in Gainesville and I’ve never experienced this dry, humid, HOT air like I have this month. My skin feels like an alligator #puns Almond oil & face masks are my new BFF. 
9378 2018-06-27 03:48:53 what is different from previous sanctions except "no wavers" to Japan and South Korea"?   let us remember, in the previous sanctions, all allies were onboard.  Europe imported zero Iranian oil. Now the administration want them to do the same, although they are not onboard.
9379 2018-06-27 03:48:52 Liberals and facts; like oil and water.
9380 2018-06-27 03:48:46 I'm no oil painting myself but surely some of these men would get their mates to vet their pics that go on Match  haha
9381 2018-06-27 03:47:52 My mom saw the ejuice in my car and asked what it was for so I said it was body oil :/
9382 2018-06-27 03:47:46 greek yogurt + grated fresh garlic + salt + tons of black pepper + lemon juice + big olive oil drizzle = the best easiest dip for veggies and pita chips  
9383 2018-06-27 03:47:32 So thats why gop is in lock step with Trump,  Russian meeting with gop and WH admins to discuss sanctions.  If sanctions are lifted and russian oil flows they ALL get a big pay day.  HA and trump supporters thought it was all about them.  Gop/trump end up filthy rich.
9384 2018-06-27 03:47:25 Oil"Black Gold" President Roosevelt traveled to middle east during WWII to stop them from selling oil to Japan. That was the beginning of what we would call nowadays OPEC. I want to know a dirty little secret. A lot of the tankers of oil are pumped back into the ground. Shhh

9388 2018-06-27 03:47:05 - Use a men’s razor for a closer shave!

- exfoliate your legs before shaving 

- try baby oil, Vaseline gel oil, coconut oil, or lotion instead of shaving cream
9389 2018-06-27 03:47:02 So many other nations now hold the USA debt. The largest are China, Japan, the Caibbean banking system and oil exporters.

9396 2018-06-27 03:46:17 The endless pseudoscience & snake oil you gotta wade through when looking for biohacking content. 

This space is saturated with quackery & the term 'biohacking' risks being synonymous with such. Ironic 'cause biohacking is meant to empower the lay into participating in Science

9400 2018-06-27 03:45:37 Sorry but I’d have to disagree. If Iran wasn’t spending so much money funding Syria wars, Palestine, terrorism, etc, and if the government wasn’t stealing oil money to buy themselves Ferrari’s while lower class people struggle to eat, we wouldn’t be here.
9401 2018-06-27 03:45:36 Heard Hezbollah paying top $$$ for US weapons like the TOW and they got a few dozen of em.. Enough to cause a minor headache to those getting a lot of US weapons as freebies the next time they go wandering to steal oil and water..

9444 2018-06-27 03:39:40 Guess he’s more interested in actual drawings and oil paintings like today’s; I think of art and I hear music or see videos that show the element you’re in.  Today’s win was an oil done by Jamie (James) MacDougall; he captures art with paint.  Poetry is the root of art.

9446 2018-06-27 03:39:29 LOL, THIS MUST BE A JOKE!  I AM FAR WORSE OFF THEN 1 YR AGO.
JUST THE PRICE OF GAS, WENT FROM $2.55 A GAL TO $3.39 A GAL.
WHY?  THIS MAN INSULTS ONE NATION AFTER ANOTHER,  ALL OF OPEC HAS BEEN INSULTED. THESE ACTS ALL CONNECT HIM 2 RUSSIAN OIL!  :(
9447 2018-06-27 03:39:20 Ideological hobby horse? This is about progress and survival and thinking out of the big oil box. Your oil lobby horse is is the biggest hobby horse of all and your refrain incredibly backward and self serving.

9455 2018-06-27 03:37:45 @papushatech When refineries make oil processing, they generate a large amount of  waste. Our PRT-2 plant can refine  different types of  fuel. It can be gaskerosene, gasoline and etc.  Our project will make  the world cleaner! #papusha #ico #PRT #presale #pollution #ecology
9456 2018-06-27 03:37:24 hi qila, sorry bump tweet lama, cuma nak tanya, coconut oil tu berapa kali dalam sebulan pakai?
9457 2018-06-27 03:37:20 Pretty sure they’re also extremely dependent on soil and care for a future for the state. Cramer clearly is bought and sold by big oil

N. Tesla invented what has been refined but blocked from use by the oil industry, it really works too, HYDRO POWER, using electrolysis. A motor home traveled the US on water ONLY in 1971. Learn the facts today!
9466 2018-06-27 03:35:15 They are apprehending 50,000 illegals a month. Somewhere between 50 and 100,000 are getting through. So we just let 125,000 + a month into country? For how long? How many? It would be wrong to ever stop any?

9468 2018-06-27 03:34:55 @bobbyberk, what type of roles make up your team? If you’re ever looking for an oil painter who can barely manage 3 paintings a year, hit me up!

9473 2018-06-27 03:33:31 Only way to fly! How do you do yours? What I usually do is cut up asparagus and squash and use garlic salt and throw them in a bag with extra virgin olive oil and let them soak for a couple hours.

9481 2018-06-27 03:32:18 Wow! That's a rough scar! Once it's healed apply vitamin E oil at least once a day. It'll give you skin more elasticity and fade the scar over time. I had a bad scar from surgery and it helped a lot.

You say cartel, I say support.

9496 2018-06-27 03:30:09 Iraq or move abroad, or go broke, or stop landing in Europe. One price of oil, and they are all illegal and carrying out a responsibility,
9497 2018-06-27 03:30:04 No just stop giving our tax dollars in the form of subsidies to big oil, big pharma, big ag, defense contractors and big tech. Idnwe stop that we can just use our own money to fund things for us instead of them.

9500 2018-06-27 03:29:35 It seems like most but not all are. Vitamin D seems worth taking. Also a decent multivitamin seems like it could be helpful if diet is otherwise shitty. Fish oil may also be good? Especially if it's a quality brand and you don't get a lot of omega-3 in diet?

9520 2018-06-27 03:27:27 I use essential oils for a lot of things related to anxiety, stress, sore muscles, pain, bruises, or like bug bites bc they work for me but someone deadass just asked the group if there’s an oil to help with kidney stone pain.

9523 2018-06-27 03:26:50 I khow someone like u. A CEO of an oil company, 8years+ in Indonesia, doesnt want to learn Bahasa because his only Bahasa’s word is “MALAS”! Thats a stupidity!

9525 2018-06-27 03:26:28 I want some lavender and rose essential oil again  I hate perfume
9526 2018-06-27 03:26:12 Trump did not even ban the country that most of the 9/11 hijackers are actually from!   Why? Because we do big money business with them!  Trump does biz with them too - we need oil production etc.!  If terrorism was his concern, wouldn't he put Saudi Arabia on the ban?
9527 2018-06-27 03:26:00 COCONUT OIL AND SUGAR MAKE A SCRUB THAT HELPS WITH PEELING/DRYNESS/MOISTURIZING. JUST SOMETHING I FOUND OUT WHILE TREATING MY OWN SUNBURNT PEELING SKIN FROM WARPED. HOPE THIS HELPS

9530 2018-06-27 03:25:50 Likewise wars for oil, a geostrategic policy of subsidizing containership supply chains by keeping the sea lanes open at taxpayer expense, subsidies to highways, an entire legal complex created by urban planners to promote car culture and sprawl, etc.
9531 2018-06-27 03:25:41 Jared remind me to make you an essential oil blend for dis (you could def just find it in California but it will be cooler coming from me)

9535 2018-06-27 03:25:22 The left in Pakistan is extremely sexist, I've also heard stories of sexual harassment by some of these 'luminaries'. They are really not that far behind the right when it comes to objectifying women.
9536 2018-06-27 03:25:14 He's using you by feeding you disinformation that you choose to believe and spread.
One example: Oil & Gas investment tanked worldwide, and started before the ndp were elected.

He doesn't care about Albertans, he cares about obtaining power.
9537 2018-06-27 03:25:07 Yeah and Bush started the war to get all of Iraq’s oil. 

Except wait....we never got the oil. 

Guess that widely accepted “fact” was proven false, though liberals always conveniently forget that.

9539 2018-06-27 03:24:58 What the heck is the point of eggplant? It's a bitter vegetable with very little nutritional value, and only tastes any good when full of olive oil.
9540 2018-06-27 03:24:25 @oilfractals @Oil_Tradr I thought you might want to read how these bots are. They all SOUND THE SAME, and tend to do the same things in certain situations. Doesn't matter if it's for oil trolling or Trump trolling. Their responses are so predictable.
9541 2018-06-27 03:24:19 Aduh jadi galau mau beli kan aku lg pengen beli rosehip oil trus tp masih bingung merk apaa soalnya dulu pernah pake yg trilogy malah bikin jerawat muncul di bks jerawat:")

9546 2018-06-27 03:23:37 Add coconut oil to your tea. It is recommended to do so with green tea or black tea in particular. The health benefits range from a boost in metabolism, clearing up brain fog and healing the brain. Not to mention the fat content in coconut oil actually helps to burn body fat.

9552 2018-06-27 03:22:34 i haven’t had any treatments for it, but my mom got shots in her feet. it helped but was only temporary. i just soak my feet in hot water with peppermint oil, roll on a tennis ball and stay off of it when i can.

9555 2018-06-27 03:22:10 I really like the sea salty spray from Lush. It's a mix of oil and salt, but really light cause its in a spray bottle (but I also have a lot of hair haha). Couple of squirts of that in my hair, crunched in, might blow dry my roots a bit in winter but that's it!

9561 2018-06-27 03:20:19 Just wanted to keep an eye on the crazy alt right "soon to be" Premier Doug Ford, so I followed him and he followed me back.  That doesn't make us friends and that doesn't mean that I like you.  Just FYI.  #cdnpoli #onpoli
9562 2018-06-27 03:20:04 No matter how or what primer, what matte foundation my skin is oily by hour 3. It comes off my nose first. I put on lotion and hydrate to keep my skin from drying out and producing more oil - but nothing. Powder helps but I must reapply on the hour after hour 3
9563 2018-06-27 03:20:02 So how many tens of millions are we obligated to? If 1 has an inherent right , then I would assume the 10 millionth or 30 millionth one has an equal right.
Essentially there is no end to it and it extends to every corner of the globe.
9564 2018-06-27 03:19:58 Very into Sans Activator 7 Hair/Body/Face oil (doesn't make greasy, conditions and smells good) but this really is a question for the curly queen @rarahsobson

9568 2018-06-27 03:19:35 Not really. Beautiful province but...weird. Politically the tend to go left. They're the one's that are trying to block the TransMountain pipeline to Burnaby, which would be great so we could get our oil to tide water.......

9572 2018-06-27 03:18:50 Exactly. Oil change and adblue every 8-10k
9573 2018-06-27 03:18:38 In three months, Oklahoma has raised taxes on oil companies, approved "the most liberal medical marijuana law in the country," and the conservative evangelical-money guy finished third in the GOP primary. Strange things are happening in Trump's America.
9574 2018-06-27 03:18:26 Used it as last resort for your car oil..

9588 2018-06-27 03:15:44 I've been to Venezuela in the 90's and things really haven't changed. The biggest difference is the oil is not causing people to turn a blind eye. Venezuela is an OPEC country.
9589 2018-06-27 03:15:41 it’s super matte and not oily at all - in fact it’s almost too drying?? so sometimes i mix in a drop of oil 

it’s been great though for summer and i don’t need base makeup bc it’s tinted enough. it does transfer a bit tho especially before it’s dried down

9606 2018-06-27 03:12:58 Nigerian sweet crude is up for sale. If you tell the rest of the world not to buy from Iran, will @realDonaldTrump provide them with oil? Looks like all the countries in the world will be sanctioned. Like  @POTUS  is creating problems with all countries of the world.
9607 2018-06-27 03:12:56 @LindseyGrahamSC that would be fine if non-Islamic travelers weren't treated differently. If we're at war with radical Islamists then what about our allies, the financiers & promoters of Salafism, aka the Gulf Arabs? Why don't we stop buying their oil as a start, conserve instead

9616 2018-06-27 03:11:23 Fish is the easiest meat to cook. Medium-high heat in a pan with some oil, ~3 minutes a side, depending on thickness. Except tuna. 30 seconds a side to sear bc you want that shit rare.

9657 2018-06-27 03:06:18 Funding transport infrastructure from a levy on transport inputs makes sense. What doesn't make sense is oil companies jacking up their prices before the tax comes in. They didn't do it in OZ. Exchange rate is stable. No increased costs. Oil companies are shafting the poor.

9665 2018-06-27 03:05:02 It is a good decision because oil revenues are either blocked in the hands of despotic regimes or spent on proxy wars and making deficient missiles .

Not sure if you did, but adding a spoon full or so of oil tends to help me with noodles getting stuck. Might also cook them a lot less, since they cook again in the oven for lasagna. Keep at it. :)

Take out, knead for a further 2-3 minutes...

9714 2018-06-27 02:58:25 It's clear as day he is a fake account. Just like Anas Alhajji used a fake account yesterday to try to divert the fact that I was exposing how WRONG he has been when it comes to US oil production. Talk about coward. I'm glad we're on Twitter exposing this.
9715 2018-06-27 02:58:18 One thing is certain!
Wherever Ramdev goes, take for granted that plant or mega refineries are dead.
Ramdev excited too much and his hunger after oil and fats shows his inner mindset to become a Monopoly through his Nagpur tactics.

9729 2018-06-27 02:56:55 but Hana what about the oil
9730 2018-06-27 02:56:48 The world is caving to Trumps equalizing our standards and the left HATES it! 4 days ago OPEC agreed to Trumps requirement for 1 million more barrels of oil. You won’t see this in the media because...
9731 2018-06-27 02:56:35 Some do sadly.  Hell if he said motor oil tastes like chocolate sauce,  they'd eat it.
9732 2018-06-27 02:56:26 The coconut oil sounds weird. Is it good? (For real.)
9733 2018-06-27 02:56:22 Want me to cover the oil sis? Gimme that pasty ass foundation then. It really wasn’t that deep. Y’all need to step OUT

9741 2018-06-27 02:55:29 My sunburn is at the itchy AF stage and I want to rip my skin off. On the plus side, I smell like coconut from slathering so much coconut oil on my sunburn.

9748 2018-06-27 02:54:17 That's what I said. Several countries including Costa Rica are doing energy mixes. Oil is good, oil is great. But Jamaica can't afford to live by oil alone.

9762 2018-06-27 02:52:17 I’m glad my Dad doesn’t have a Twitter, he’d be on some shit like “The hardest pill I had to swallow was a Fish Oil pill” like boyyyy wtf 
9763 2018-06-27 02:52:07 Couldn't agree more. With oil getting hit so hard and the extreme negative sentiment it suffered, a lot of money has left and hasn't come back. This lack of investment over the years in E&P and infrastructure will slowly start to catch up with reality and it's very bullish.
9764 2018-06-27 02:52:07 I literally ask them if they say "vegetable oil" to read the ingredients.
9765 2018-06-27 02:51:57 I watched 2 seasons of queer eye and now I use argon oil on my public hair send tweet

9767 2018-06-27 02:51:41 Only want a man for car washes & oil changes them two things I hate doing 
9768 2018-06-27 02:51:23 Common on gas prices, lets make it to $5.00 a gallon. Oil don’t like instability and trump is the least stable person I’ve seen.
9769 2018-06-27 02:51:14 I guess They see Scandinavia, and think that’s what they want. What they don’t see is large sovereign oil funds, largely homogenous population demographics, and low corporate taxes. 

Granted even they don’t have a UBJ but don’t tell them that lol.
9770 2018-06-27 02:51:12 It's frequently "soya" in other places but if something is fried in oil you have literally no way of knowing if they use generic cheap vegetable oil cos they don't know either.
9771 2018-06-27 02:51:12 With the CSX Frontier Yard right across Broadway, Cheektowaga Town Board is asking Governor Cuomo to restart railroad inspections across the state. With an increasing number of crude oil trains running across New York, activists want an end or tighter regulation of "bomb trains."
9772 2018-06-27 02:51:08 Actually it is a poor Muslim ban. Oil rich majority Muslim countries are exempt.
9773 2018-06-27 02:51:01 I just remembered getting backhauls for lube a chain oil co. back in the early 80s.  What a blast from my past! #trucking
9774 2018-06-27 02:50:52 All the countries who have oil and decide to sell their oil in any currency except the dollar = invasion

9786 2018-06-27 02:49:49 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
9787 2018-06-27 02:49:35 As Elon musk says, it’s the dumbest experiment ever. Even if you’re right, coal and oil are still going to run out anyway. We will need alternative forms of energy at some point!!

9793 2018-06-27 02:49:09 So maybe the next lawsuit should focus on the oil companie' misconduct:  they knew 50 years ago, they chose to cover it up, and they lied publicly about the science, breeding a big public nuisance, US Citizens who don't believe the scientific method is credible.
9794 2018-06-27 02:49:05 Thank you! I’ve just learned about RSO and am going to work on this next, marijuana is helping, cbd oil isn’t doing anything, I need to learn more about cannabis and researching more
9795 2018-06-27 02:48:52 While u are at it.. the PG should dig up that old story of the train routes through the city and SW Pa that carry petroleum/oil through our neighborhoods. It was shocking when I first saw it about four or five years ago...

9797 2018-06-27 02:48:40 It's not like they have an effective Navy.

9802 2018-06-27 02:47:41 what about that small inconvenient fact that the oil companies KNEW about climate change science 50 years ago, then COVERED IT UP and LIED about it, while also actively discrediting scientists and the whole scientific method? Hmm, maybe that's the base of the next lawsuit...

9852 2018-06-27 02:40:41 Tried to fix my headache w peppermint oil, oil leaked into eyes and now instead of a headache I’m just straight up crying #winningatlife

9854 2018-06-27 02:40:31 • castor oil ( massage area for 5 - 10 mins ) 

• rub aloe Vera on the stretch marks and rinse with lukewarm water 

• lemon juice, rub it in and then rinse It after 10 mins
9855 2018-06-27 02:40:27 I have a big combat scene to write this weekend - at least two chapters. Best not burn out my creative oil this early in the week. x)
9856 2018-06-27 02:40:24 I use coconut oil because most sunscreen causes health issues and coconut oil lets me tan and not burn
9857 2018-06-27 02:40:17 Oil of Every Pearl's Un-insides by Sophie is the only album to come out in so long that's felt truly special to me. 

(last was Bjork's Utopia, 2017)
9858 2018-06-27 02:40:12 Ice pack and peppermint oil in a diffuser. I havent found any drug that helps sinxe 13 years old. Nothing like getting side effects from a drug when you already feel like youre dying.
9859 2018-06-27 02:40:10 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
9860 2018-06-27 02:40:08 These fake news channels are very happy when ever some one across the world creates a news against India. Oil  price crash or reducing its dependence in India would kill these prestitutes and starve them of their income source. @OpIndia_com
9861 2018-06-27 02:40:04 Taiyo Oil LTD is a scam
9862 2018-06-27 02:39:57 @AllynPaul ever find oil seemingly dripping from your Timemaster transmission / rear axle?
9863 2018-06-27 02:39:53 Oh yeah mental health is richer than oil
9864 2018-06-27 02:39:52 WTI Oil > 70
9865 2018-06-27 02:39:47 tea tree oil kinda smells like fruit loops
9866 2018-06-27 02:39:36 ใช่จ้า
9867 2018-06-27 02:39:27 Leff never got caught loading the ball as a pitcher because he used the oil from his huge ears
9868 2018-06-27 02:39:24 That’s insane. I always go to the guys  on Alafaya called express oil change
9869 2018-06-27 02:39:17 aw maN NOT THE PATCHOULI OIL
9870 2018-06-27 02:39:12 It's pure emotion. Under the argument put forth the 1st poor Honduran is just as deserving as the 15 or 50 millionth one.  Same goes for Camaroon, Eritrea et al. At no point can you EVER say no or enough is enough. 
The worlds poor have unrestricted right.
9871 2018-06-27 02:39:02 And it begins. Remember this acronym: ORAB. Oil Rates Asset Bubble. This is how they start.
9872 2018-06-27 02:39:02 Nissan has oil changes for 5$
9873 2018-06-27 02:39:01 When oil is a concern.
9874 2018-06-27 02:38:41 Sorry to selit but the most luxurious tissue ever is Kleenex Rose essential oil or Cherry Blossom scented tissues mashaaAllah so lovely  not sold in sg though, ppl sanggup buy from JB
9875 2018-06-27 02:38:19 Like I said, sentiment has been [the worst] in history against #oil and especially Canadian oil.  Some names may need longer times to establish their worth thru strong Qs; some require hedges to roll off, others may do debt reducing asset sales, either way, it is a matter of time
9876 2018-06-27 02:38:13 Libya first needs to have a unified central government, the internationally recognized gov doesn't even control the country's oil exports anymore and that may lead to an all out civil war
9877 2018-06-27 02:38:08 Asian Stocks Fall on Trade; Crude Extends Rally /articles/2018-06-26/asian-stocks-set-for-mixed-start-oil-rallies-markets-wrap

9879 2018-06-27 02:38:02 I was at the dmv today and this old lady next to me was with her husband and she asked him “I wonder if this cannabis oil is legal in Idaho” 
9880 2018-06-27 02:38:00 Klubot needs an oil change, I guess. Even Kluber isn’t infallible.
9881 2018-06-27 02:37:58 Someone get Kluber some oil because the Klubot is a little rusty. He will bounce back. @CLEsportsTalk @CespedesBBQ
9882 2018-06-27 02:37:52 Face oil.
9883 2018-06-27 02:37:51 I mean the skin is usually still gonna peel but I’d try something with coconut oil or shea butter in it.
9884 2018-06-27 02:37:29 Oh yes! High quality lavender essential oil
9885 2018-06-27 02:37:20 This lawsuit will be thrown out just like the one you frauds did to the oil companies re: climate change. Sadly for you, progressives waging law fare is over. And in November, so will be your political career.
9886 2018-06-27 02:37:17 Anyone know somewhere good to get a oil change at? Fuck super lube tho
9887 2018-06-27 02:37:03 Russia would be Oil and Gas. They are part of OECD man. Not sure about anetherlands though. Google Baba ki Jai karo!
9888 2018-06-27 02:36:59 cooking oil
9889 2018-06-27 02:36:59 Well I got different kinds of pens I don’t like that you have to use their battery I already got a vape like that. But as far as regular cartridges go select oil beat all of them fr all their shit is 90% thc minimum
9890 2018-06-27 02:36:55 face oil
9891 2018-06-27 02:36:55 I need to get me some more coconut oil. Done ran tf out.
9892 2018-06-27 02:36:47 Perhaps, instead of blaming the migrants, you instead blame the government's of either side of the aisle and demand they stop trying to overthrow governments in oil rich countries like Venezuela.  It might help.
9893 2018-06-27 02:36:23 They still have the oil tho.
9894 2018-06-27 02:36:22 It occurs to me that perhaps banning oil imports from other countries is more about enriching billionaires in this country than it is about foreign policy.
9895 2018-06-27 02:36:18 Baby oil apa nih?
9896 2018-06-27 02:35:58 Vote for @jaredpolis if you want to shut down 10% of our states economy - oil and gas. Vote for @jaredpolis if you want to the state to take over health care. Vote for @jaredpolis if you want to more division between rich and poor. Vote for @jaredpolis  and your foolish
9897 2018-06-27 02:35:57 Like when Cheney promised Iraqi oil was going to pay for the war.  Republicans never stop scamming America.
9898 2018-06-27 02:35:55 And Trudeau is waiting for his check for destroying the Canadian oil biz.
9899 2018-06-27 02:35:36 lavender body oil really have me super relaxed & sleepy
9900 2018-06-27 02:35:29 Klubot needs an oil change.
(Come to think of it, so does my car )
9901 2018-06-27 02:35:26 Julian just went to go throw his bowling ball down the lane and he really just slipped on the oil and fell straight on his ass. I'm fucking crying 
9902 2018-06-27 02:35:25 Another tRump tweet. 
"Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter"
Trump is nothing more than a snake oil salesman .
9903 2018-06-27 02:35:24 Enjoy your CBD oil.
9904 2018-06-27 02:35:21 I’ve said it a million times they sold us Snake Oil.  Nepotism, championing causes that are undermined by pop trump. Dont stand up for the rule of law, running their business from the 1600 Penn Ave, traveling the world on our dime to secure deals for their family.  MAGA!
9905 2018-06-27 02:35:16 Yeah. Avocado oil for the high smoke point and the symmetry of the thing
9906 2018-06-27 02:35:14 Cbd oil, kratom, burn sage, yoga, drink lots water
9907 2018-06-27 02:34:36 I’m talking bout everything including the pen itself not just the oil lol.
9908 2018-06-27 02:34:27 there are also a good 15 off shore platform rigs with more on the drawing board to be developed which will go to oil ports in the West
9909 2018-06-27 02:34:16 Oh dang. The alafaya one literally forgot to put parts of my car back together after an oil change!
9910 2018-06-27 02:34:15 I never expected such negligency and careless ness from Indian Oil Pump's employees at wakad pune. They filled petrol in my diesel car and now they are not feeling guilty also for this negligence. I have to attend a meeting and I have no clue what to do.
9911 2018-06-27 02:34:12 Money, oil and corruption all in one nice package
9912 2018-06-27 02:34:04 The hyphen makes it "SUB!" As in "Abner,  light the oil lamp, we are SUB electricity." The code phrase possibilities are endless.
9913 2018-06-27 02:34:00 SBI has decided to stop dealing with Iran under US pressure and this has resulted in Indian Oil cutting back on Iranian imports.  Saudi Arabia, Russia and Iraq now big winners
9914 2018-06-27 02:33:55 Oil tumbles 4 percent; Saudi Arabia cools on output freeze
9915 2018-06-27 02:33:48 oil ports in west come from Elephant Field, Tuaregs have it/Tebu also have an oil field out of the Fezzan - but what will go to the eastern NOC is from the Oil Crescent fields - what is in Barqah/Cyrenaica
9916 2018-06-27 02:33:44 Let’s admit that everyone in Oil country was hoping something good was going to happen...
9917 2018-06-27 02:33:44 No one other than you lead tainted snake oil salesman and performance artist is saying this. Just to sell lead tainted snake oil. #magats
9918 2018-06-27 02:33:43 You must not have had select oil lol
9919 2018-06-27 02:33:39 Hmm. And how about when you were censured for "making extravagant claims outside the bounds of science" by the Senate? Can we look forward to your interview by the snake oil salesman?
9920 2018-06-27 02:33:37 Peppermint oil, rub it on your temple
9921 2018-06-27 02:33:30 Aku kleveru yg jojoba oil, baru pake 2 hari tapi
9922 2018-06-27 02:33:24 Oil extortion threatens #Libya core resource. Natl Oil Corporation under Sanallah only entity with right to sell oil & keep economy going. Diversions risk vortex of corruption & must be stopped by political, legal, and as needed military means as US did to Morning Glory in 2014
9923 2018-06-27 02:33:24 Face oil
9924 2018-06-27 02:33:08 I stopped at a Chinese market because I needed chili oil. A musical version of Danny Boy was playing.
9925 2018-06-27 02:32:47 @TheGabbieShow hi i know you’re suffering because of the facial you had done, so i thought i’d recommend you try using coconut oil; it sounds weird and it is a long shot but the stuff works wonders. it’s fixed so many scratches and scars for me, it’s worth a try!
9926 2018-06-27 02:32:28 I'm trying everything to get rid of this damn headache, but very little seems to be helping. Gonna just sip on some peach tea and listen to ambient music for a while. 

I probably just need sleep, but you know me :') Gotta burn that midnight oil.
9927 2018-06-27 02:32:23 /rlt/ cara ngilangin tinta bekas nyoblos gimana sih gue terlalu dalem nyelupinnya malu euy, micellar oil bisa gak?:(
9928 2018-06-27 02:32:22 The last place I want to camp in Toledo is between housing projects and a oil refinery.
9929 2018-06-27 02:32:14 I’ve been obsessed lately with doing a charcoal peel off mask and then after doing a turmeric and coconut oil mask. Bc I have dry skin so the peel off masks dry even more but I love how it clears my pores. So I just follow up with the turmeric bc it rehydrates
9930 2018-06-27 02:31:48 My grandma calls her cbd oil her “joy juice” and she’s cute I love her
9931 2018-06-27 02:31:41 You can use tea tree oil on that and it will burn a little at first but it will make them stop itching like completely.
9932 2018-06-27 02:31:31 Oil prices are DOWN.
9933 2018-06-27 02:31:29 Clarins Lip Oil is just gentrified early 2000s beauty supply red roll on lip gloss
9934 2018-06-27 02:31:23 Is China gonna buy Iranian oil? That would piss Trump off
9935 2018-06-27 02:31:21 
9936 2018-06-27 02:31:10 Anyone know where Lucas Oil Field is?
9937 2018-06-27 02:31:06 Wage stats from the BLS report last week. Republicans and the Trump administration have tried to kill renewables with everything they possibly can throw at them. That increases the demand for oil, which increases consumer gasoline prices.
9938 2018-06-27 02:30:59 My wife was on a deadly amount of narcotics.  CBD oil provides her more pain relief.
9939 2018-06-27 02:30:54 เท่าใรครับ
9940 2018-06-27 02:30:41 He did pick up the olive oil.  My Aron experiment was a success.
9941 2018-06-27 02:30:40 All eyes on oil supply after Opec deal to boost output...
9942 2018-06-27 02:30:37 Stadium. Lucas Oil STADIUM
9943 2018-06-27 02:30:35 Plz put some navratn oil..garmi se dimag leak ho raha hai...
9944 2018-06-27 02:30:26 So its all about oil and gas, ethnic cleansing is here in the US today, and just given a green light by the supreme court. Rohingya people are the wrong color and the wrong religion for assistance from our god Trump.
9945 2018-06-27 02:30:23 June 26, 2018 at 10:30PM Waiting for #Ecuador to admit Petroecuador oil spills
9946 2018-06-27 02:30:20 India is in a tough spot as it needs cheap Oil and also what will happen to the investments being made in the Chabahar port, aimed to counter China. 
It will be interesting to see whether China listens to the US on this.
9947 2018-06-27 02:30:14 Get Buddy some THC oil!
9948 2018-06-27 02:30:08 With the high price of home heating fuels and the often sketchy availability of Oil or Natural Gas in the Dead of Winter many home owners are looking to Fireplaces and Wood Burning Stoves as a Primary or Secondary Method of heating their home.
9949 2018-06-27 02:30:05 No. Medicare /Medicade is the top expense by far. Add in welfare in general terms and up to this year they were double military spending.
9950 2018-06-27 02:30:02 In Saudi Arabia, if an oil field is found in your garden you must report it to the state before digging a bore hole greater than 5000 feet.
9951 2018-06-27 02:29:57 I always do coconut oil treatments and my hair looks and feels so good after
9952 2018-06-27 02:29:53 depend on dosage of thc oil
9953 2018-06-27 02:29:50 Also electric cars are getting very reasonably priced.. the Chinese have moved to massive solar production so it is getting competitive, Big mistake letting big oil dictate policy.
9954 2018-06-27 02:29:47 Working with oil paints is just amazing. 
9955 2018-06-27 02:29:09 That makes sense. I use the CBD oil Roll On strictly for sore muscles after working out. It’s helps a ton.
9956 2018-06-27 02:29:07 These r psychological warfare to make the economy even more unstable & make people to protest. Cuz, #Trump doesn't have the global coalition (#TradeWars) to convince #China, #India or #Russia from buying #Iran's oil
Russia/ China cannot afford an unstable Iran,especially Russia.
9957 2018-06-27 02:29:02 Check your oil and check your coolant!!
9958 2018-06-27 02:28:55 My favorite kind of thirst traps are the spiritual ones where it’s like, “watch me open up my chakras by rubbing this rose oil all over my body.”
9959 2018-06-27 02:28:42 BP will cover them with oil soon enough
9960 2018-06-27 02:28:37 Y’all ever used Rick Ross’ beard oil?
9961 2018-06-27 02:28:33 Jajajja fijate si esta abierto la oil vos que estas mas cerca
9962 2018-06-27 02:28:24 Me: that one guy with the hat and he said something about milkshakes and was in the oil movie and also had a hat and was in a gang but not Leonardo DiCaprio’s gang and he makes shoes.

Wolfgang: .....that’s not on IMDB.
9963 2018-06-27 02:28:16 you nailed it! Also they'd like us to line up seeking Saudi help on oil forever which is a win-win for both US & SA. Russia is the 1st one to break this Omerta!
9964 2018-06-27 02:28:10 Why, why is that the beloved Inhofe of Oklahoma? Oklahoma, where those benevolent oil companies find science programs in public schools? Or was it pogroms?
9965 2018-06-27 02:27:43 Japan was always a closed society and to a large extent still is. Prob one of the lowest levels of immigration of any country.
9966 2018-06-27 02:27:27 apa yang busuk sangat tea tree oil ni
9967 2018-06-27 02:27:23 What makes Olive oil “Extra Virgin” like who not fucking the Olives?
9968 2018-06-27 02:27:13 That’s cute because the places with the highest quality of life all use aspects of socialism. Norway has nationalized oil companies, Canada has universal health care, Finland has no tuitions for schools etc..
9969 2018-06-27 02:27:09 Gonna do hairfinity again. That and weekly coconut oil hair masks. That’s what made it long and curly and healthy last time. UNTIL I DYED IT LIKE AN IDIOT.
9970 2018-06-27 02:27:09 Drink the oil off the top problem solved.
9971 2018-06-27 02:26:54 @beyondCoal @reclaimthepower demand ur pol stop taking kick backs n giving ur tax money 2subsidize #coal #CSG #oil #MurdochMedia
9972 2018-06-27 02:26:32 I can’t make it up. That chick also threw out like $500 worth of clothes of mine into a dumpster full of oil..... that chick was INSANE.
9973 2018-06-27 02:26:30 Add a little vitamin E oil to your palms for extra effect.
9974 2018-06-27 02:26:13 India and China are the biggest buyers of Iranian Oil. China purchased Iranian oil at a rate of 671,000 barrels a day in April, while India imported 604,000 barrels a day. Together India and China buy 60% of Iran’s total exports, US wants this to stop.
9975 2018-06-27 02:25:57 Many Canadian energy names still have all the bad news you can imagine baked into the shareprices (some are emerging, not all)

Specific to :
- #NAFTA (pending)
- Horgan/Notley (mixed)
- Pipeline issues (pending resolve)
- Low oil prices (resolved)
- Threat of BAT (resolved)
9976 2018-06-27 02:25:54 I sure hope so.
We need these clowns to go back to the circus.
9977 2018-06-27 02:25:45 gua mau nambahin, ngilangin juga juga bisa pake baby oil. ditaroin aja baby oilnya terus tunggu sekiranya satu jam. pada rontok juga.
9978 2018-06-27 02:25:20 I just find it strange that when either @jpmorgan or @GoldmanSachs come out with a statement, the opposite usually happens. I get that they have a vested interest, but it's very odd when both these so called elite financial institutions get bearish on oil and it goes higher.
9979 2018-06-27 02:25:13 The dollar is the new bitcoin. lol.

Oil being high is weird to me. Is it being bought up as a safety-play-of-sorts? Peter schiff is blowing a lot of smoke at me about $100 oil.
9980 2018-06-27 02:25:03 Citronella and lavender oil... js
9981 2018-06-27 02:24:51 Sounds like obesity central. Use some coconut oil or butter Jesus lol
9982 2018-06-27 02:24:48 Girl. Try Cover FX! It has skin care in it and is oil free and feels amazing! It has buildable coverage and manages to hide my zits but still let my freckles through! All it totally stays on. Best foundation ever!
9983 2018-06-27 02:24:43 Deja tu las piernas, las nalgas !!!!
9984 2018-06-27 02:24:33 Yeah, so where does the $150k come from? Oil companies and RW interest groups.

Thank you Ecojustice Canada Societ and everyone for calling out the frauds at Friends of Alt Science 
9985 2018-06-27 02:24:24 Oil the machine girls. Two more nights. I believe in you! Taylor has already committed to helping next yr. She signed her recruitment letter tonight
9986 2018-06-27 02:24:23 micellar water is the make-up remover that has formulated with no oil  so it's efficient
9987 2018-06-27 02:24:10 Pour out your oil in my burning heart.
9988 2018-06-27 02:24:04 Oil has nowhere to go but up!
9989 2018-06-27 02:23:53 How did they get their address???
9990 2018-06-27 02:23:45 Lol! She had coconut oil in her bath tonight so it was a task! She’s so ginormous it’s hilarious
9991 2018-06-27 02:23:44 Perhaps the autonomy of #Tripoli's #NOC was under threat. Nothing would surprise me. Haftar's enemies don't negotiate and Libya has fallen into #anarchy. Some group paid #Jadran to disrupt the oil industry...
9992 2018-06-27 02:23:31 I believe there will be unwritten verbal agreements between Trump and Putin to align closer to KSA, raise oil prices to reward Putin, and isolate Iran further (disastrous) for destabilization. In exchange US will look other way on Ukraine, Human Rights, and Trump’s dictatorship
9993 2018-06-27 02:23:22 The Thai version probably wont leak oil
9994 2018-06-27 02:23:14 i wanna rub baby oil all over javi baez.
9995 2018-06-27 02:23:02 that video of haechan and kun starting a fire in the kitchen reminds me of that video of the guy putting fries in boiling oil and it starting on fire
9996 2018-06-27 02:22:48 Cleansing milk and hydrating mist are lovely! Oil free moisturizer is great too
9997 2018-06-27 02:22:47 Little different there pal. The oil funded gvt was giving out food and refrigerators at election time. We have a diverse and much larger economy that can support public benefits.
9998 2018-06-27 02:22:40 What the fuck stop curating lives
9999 2018-06-27 02:22:37 It has been since oil went over $50 for the most part
10000 2018-06-27 02:22:30 Really?! You had it before? I used to eat when I was very small, my mom always put them in my luchbox!  It's so goooood with ketchup!! Yeaaah so nice when it's crunchy! I think it's better fried them with oil instead of using microwave.
