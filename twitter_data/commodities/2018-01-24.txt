63 2018-01-24 21:23:10 I've been pretty publicly wrong on the dollar for 12 months now.  But I'm sticking with it.  Think a big reversal in a number of dollar currency pairs is coming.  Lets see how commodities do when that happens.
64 2018-01-24 21:22:18 I agree, treating people as commodities is common as can be seen by Apple sweat shops making phones, or the horrendous conditions in Amazon warehouses. Companies also do good as well. Generalization and extremism lead to tunnel vision and ignorance.

133 2018-01-24 18:23:35 That is not the case for most of the major US & UK banks. All employees are restricted from buying stocks (forbidden), ETFs (permission required), and commodities (forbidden). Bitcoin is still allowed in most, but already forbidden in for example HSBC. "

139 2018-01-24 18:06:09 I imagine that the men who attended Misogynist Ball are a tad bewildered as they must see women as commodities to be bought, mitigated by 'charity' status. I am so pleased at the outcry.
140 2018-01-24 18:06:06 People who trade services for commodities or wealth should request their desired exchange rate. Relying on the consumer to provide a tip is nonsensical as it allows for the tipper to notate the value of the service, rather than leave the worker to decide...

146 2018-01-24 17:46:35 It is very dangerous to have one huge business with such a foothold on so many commodities. I like Amazon like anyone else, but I still don’t think this is a good situation. Too many people losing jobs

153 2018-01-24 17:20:32 I posted this article to a Facebook policy group, and it's generated some good discussion about 1) whether policies should be considered commodities given the money paid for them under single-payer would return to patients to spend elsewhere...

156 2018-01-24 17:14:26 Part of the strong oil story is now supported by the weakening dollar. I think it's important to watch how the dollar behaves as commodities seem to be gaining stronger footing.

162 2018-01-24 17:06:17 A lot of ordinary people are disgusted that this has happened. Women are not commodities to be used and abused in that way. Kudos to the @FT for breaking the story.
163 2018-01-24 17:03:05 It's weird to me though bc Jon Gruden hasn't recruited in 30 years either and somehow he's been one of the hottest commodities every year for what seems like forever

234 2018-01-24 13:58:46 The Chinese gov has price controls on commodities, manufactured goods and services and it subsidizes agriculture and production in order to keep inflation on those goods down. So cost of living and business tends to be low which also makes them more competitive.

236 2018-01-24 13:51:22 A weaker dollar likely starts having more impact on commodities & thus inflation, which implies more hikes & higher rates than the market is pricing. In other words, ironically, the weaker dollar everyone is looking for could shorten the end of this cycle vs stable or stronger $

359 2018-01-24 05:17:04 What are the great. 
1. Fuel scarcity 
2. Exponential increase in the price of commodities 
3. Economic recession 
4. Massive devaluation of Naira 
5. Massacre of innocent civilians by the Fulani terrorists herdsmen. 
6. Arbitrary arrests and detention without trial of opposition
360 2018-01-24 05:16:41 On the real last year @FatKidDeals posted like 100 rolls of toilet paper , 50 paper towels, 100 febreeze trash bags, and other commodities in 100 quantities and I still haven’t run out of anything.
361 2018-01-24 05:12:25 I don’t think either. The rich have as much incentive to fear inflation as anyone. More insofaras they are creditors which is diminished by inflation. Best hedge against inflation and risk is good diversification. And commodities are a bad bet except as small holding.
362 2018-01-24 05:10:24 That's probably where they came from in the first place. I'd love to see the DNA profiles of that family. Better keep track of these kids. Gov NEANDERTHAL is as corrupt as they get. People are commodities to him.

365 2018-01-24 04:45:58 Spines are valuable commodities in the apocalypse, Dan.  Don't give yours away so easily.  I'll trade one spine for one canister of gasoline.
366 2018-01-24 04:31:39 I notice 401k's don't even offer a hedge against inflation: commodities, precious metals, futures, emerging markets are all stigmatized as too speculative for retirement plans. Coercive cathexis in the system, human shield for the hyperrich, or both?

371 2018-01-24 03:57:52 Why would they gamble their life savings on commodities contracts? Were they gamblers asking for trouble? Or just stupid?
372 2018-01-24 03:57:30 What a nonsense. What happens after they release the fixed rate? Remember Brasil 1999? Maxi devaluation of the real or samba effect. The only reason Brasil is not a Venezuela today is because we somehow directed the gains from commodities hike to our industry sector.
373 2018-01-24 03:52:30 Trump is trying to win a commodities game (producing solar panels) when we should be fostering an environment for innovation.

376 2018-01-24 03:14:18 I had an epiphany- At their core, Democrats are people who care about the wellbeing of others & the welfare of the planet. Republicans are people who care only for themselves & see the planet as a bunch of commodities to be fished, hunted, drilled, slashed, burned &mined. #Resist

382 2018-01-24 02:49:40 Ehhrr No. Processed water is not a right it's a commodity and we are privileged to live on a planet with breathable air. Health Care is also a commodity which means it's not a right because you don't have a right to commodities.

386 2018-01-24 02:30:09 Pertinent issue is if courts, arbitration panels, GAFTA, commodities exchanges, surveyors, banks etc will accept evidences of blockchain ledgers. In any case India is in denial mode for such technologies.
387 2018-01-24 02:22:58 On subject of consumer relations in Ag

There seems to be a growing movement of:

“We the people who possess knowledge about producing commodities should change to accommodate the emotions of those who do not.”

If you can’t see the error there I can’t help you.

390 2018-01-24 02:17:14 My Irish brother made the first homemade sauerkraut I'd ever had. It was DEE-LISH with a capital-D.
