1 2018-06-14 23:44:21 I’m not going to shame people who are in prostitution, but I will give them empathy. Who I will shame, are the pieces of shit who buy sex from them thus reducing them down to commodities. Sex work is not a legitimate field of employment, but a system of exploitation.

3 2018-06-14 23:40:34 @MBawumia @NAkufoAddo There has been this talk about Ghana’s growth. You ask yourself what has Been the major driving factor of growth. Two things. Rising commodities prices occasioned by the rise and strength of China and India growth, second was rising debt.

5 2018-06-14 23:39:44 The Euro plunged more than two big figures from above 1.1800 to below 1.1600. European stocks surged, but the relatively stronger US dollar weighed on commodities and brought a more muted reaction from US investors @MicMcCarthy_CMC

7 2018-06-14 23:20:11 Makes sense.  It reminds me of a commodities’ futures contract term structure.  The closer a contract comes to expiration, the more volatile it is, ie, more factors affecting its supply/demand.
8 2018-06-14 23:18:48 We have millions of unemployed and underemployed people consuming useless plastic commodities to use up tons of resources building mile-high monuments to capitalism. We have maybe(?) 10 years to deal with both climate and biodepletion or humans are finished! Get the message out!
9 2018-06-14 23:15:00 I will never accept populism as a normalized condition.  It makes the same amount of sense realistically as Venezuela's decision to tie commodities to currency.  Your opinion might be hyperinflated today and forgotten tomorrow.  Not a good way to govern.

38 2018-06-14 22:06:24 VC is about selling the most commoditied of commodities (cash) so branding become critical.
39 2018-06-14 22:05:34 Aunty Oby, as an economists, kindly shed more light with this analysis #declineinflation in comparative with high price of commodities at the open market.
40 2018-06-14 21:56:56 First, my fair calculation for the USDBRL is 4,70, and now is 3,80 this is the buying power parity. we have elections in October and the perception of risk can change. if commodities do not keep going up, the dollar index can go up to 98 to 100.
41 2018-06-14 21:53:27 The problem is agri commodities ain't reacting to their own inherent reasons like demand vs supply or production, but more to the political uncertainties. That's what is making 'em look scary! You can't predict anything for even a week!

45 2018-06-14 21:29:34 Countries will make compromises to trade. looong history of having tariffs while Dairy is protected. Every country has products it protects. The question for lots of us is ...Should our commodities have to pay tariffs to do business with other countries so SM can be protected?
46 2018-06-14 21:27:01 Bruh this would honestly be worse than the Brooklyn deal bc they atleast got some old commodities this would be the spurs taking D or maybe C players for a superstar and hall of fame player in his prime lol 
47 2018-06-14 21:23:06 Governos tucanos vendem a retórica de que foram uma inflexão estrutural nisso,mas  os dados sugerem que não. Viveram de receitas extraordinárias do boom de commodities, despesas já vinham numa trajetória explosiva e irresponsável, agravada no governo Anastasia.
48 2018-06-14 21:10:51 As for other commodities, dairy was not included in NAFTA the first time aprund and tariffs are what they are now outside of supply mngt. Dairy wants out again amd even american farmers don't want to dismantle pur dairy system so it should be a non issue.

50 2018-06-14 21:06:06 that makes more sense, then. I have to admit I dislike the idea of direct state control & sales of commodities of any kind, but that's a separate issue
51 2018-06-14 21:03:51 The balance....hmmm...the question is how large are tariffs that other commodities pay to protect SM.
52 2018-06-14 20:54:59 Sorry, but I have not been paying attention lately. Thinking about the dollar and implications to dollar-based commodities with important export economics
53 2018-06-14 20:53:51 This is no longer funny...being Kenyan is actually painfull....we have not even talked of increased tax on food commodities and dividends in saccos.....no salary increment, and others looting it all....what is this really????
54 2018-06-14 20:49:33 Thank goodness someone else is seeing this. Embellishment of standards of commodities is the single most counter intuitive idea impressed upon British Agriculture. We must respond to the market- not what they say, but pay for

57 2018-06-14 20:34:01 For butchers the meat situation at the moment is one of extreme difficulty. There is evidence that the public are becoming tired of frozen meat and are refusing to purchase it preferring fish and other unrationed commodities or raw ham.
58 2018-06-14 20:32:21 Yet that are treated like commodities under FoM rules. Continental navvies.
59 2018-06-14 20:27:23 "im just going to throw away the metaphysical foundations of society, culture and identity, and replace it with meaningless virtual commodities that serves as high-fructose replacements for genuine achievement and communal fulfillment....GENIUS!
60 2018-06-14 20:20:02 Much worse than that, they do not distinguish between employers bad practice and the migrants themselves. They are becoming the anti semitic, anti immigrant party. We now see LP MP talking about turning off the tap referring to to migrants as commodities
61 2018-06-14 20:10:00 Kenya due to corruption has been identified as dumping  destination for sub standard commodities . You mean  greedy businessman/corrupt leaders have sunk this low on morals.  China can as well take over Kenya  as her Colony .
62 2018-06-14 20:07:34 It's not that simplistic. That's like stuff from libertarian YouTube videos. Money is highly complex, it has network effects. "Backed by" means many things not just commodities. As I said, we just disagree politically, it's not worth arguing coming from such different worldviews!
63 2018-06-14 20:06:43 Pardon but trust me I do understand completely. From trading commodities virtually round the clock for near thirty-five years (what is the 'time zone' thing anyway) to maintaining a highly active investment profile, its about challenge and willingness to spend time on the edge.
64 2018-06-14 20:06:11 The price of a barrel is higher now and we are producing much much more commodities now than we were back then.
We have a spending problem plain and simple.
65 2018-06-14 20:06:01 Just in time is ok as long as you have a steady, predictable level of consumption. This may work with some commodities, but there will always be a need for Just in Case within the military.
66 2018-06-14 20:05:10 By "Work hard" you mean sell dangerous commodities?
67 2018-06-14 20:04:41 if you see this, in a book or website: "How to spot trend reversals"

You are dealing with idiots. #markets #stocks #forex #crypto #commodities
68 2018-06-14 20:02:23 Not absurd at all. Commodities prices frequently swing following govt announcements.
69 2018-06-14 20:00:51 Better learn economics and mutual commodities protectionism. Each nation has special items they tariff the crap out of to protect their own domestic production. But Trumpty Dumpty wants to screw small farmers and small manufactures so ZTE can sell spyware phones to us.

75 2018-06-14 19:26:07 One of these days, we're going to see "water" right up there, in the news, among the commodities, with oil.  Between climate change & pollution, our clean water sources are in danger. May sound like hyperbole, but ask Cape Town how they're doing.

78 2018-06-14 19:23:36 The fact that commodities are priced in Dollars does not mean they have to be settled in Dollars. These countries are involved in open, liquid and active foreign exchange markets for this purpose.

83 2018-06-14 19:19:11 If commodities are only priced in USD (esp energy commodities), & they can't print USD, how do they get the USD's to pay for those commodities?
84 2018-06-14 19:14:51 All sorts of stuff (commodities, agricultural and consumable products, intermediate and finished industrial products, consumer goods, services...). Not sure a list would add to this
85 2018-06-14 19:13:40 The best thing that could happen for the market over the next few months would be a stronger $UUP and a weaker $TLT.  Higher rates and dollar could weaken commodities despite improving US demand.  Stay tuned.
86 2018-06-14 19:13:23 "This FOMC Is Very Much Data Driven, Al Broaddus" Says. Source Bloomberg. I disagree totally as to where they get their data from-it's not from the real world we live in.

88 2018-06-14 19:09:03 And over time, the rate at which goods and services prices are increasing will fall to point where actual decline in the price of the commodities themselves will be evident. Determining the rate of inflation that will bring us to that point is another kettle of fish entirely

96 2018-06-14 18:44:26 It does.  Because the SEC is effectively saying ETH is a commodity.  Enter the CFTC, which is very open to derivatives on commodities. If anyone else is going to the Cardozo Law talk today on crypto and wants to me, DM me.  SEC staffers will be there.

102 2018-06-14 18:16:36 This is not so.

103 2018-06-14 18:10:22 Previously, bitcoin and ETH may have been offered as securities (like shares of a company), which would have required registration with the SEC, but a consensus has emerged that they behave and are treated like commodities, similar to gold and oil.
104 2018-06-14 18:09:03 That’s why you’ve got me baby! The key is the classification of a coin/token as a security will hinge on how decentralized the underlying network actually is.  Only non-security tokens will be allowed to trade outside of SEC regulated exchanges (governed similar to commodities).
105 2018-06-14 18:08:53 Commodities that you mention fluctuate with feedstock prices and market forces.  Also you shop around to get the best price you can.  For better or worse we are all stuck with nufc and most don’t vote with their feet

147 2018-06-14 16:26:15 Is it more about consumption or the asset's ability to generate cash flow? you can consume commodities but betting on them is speculation.
148 2018-06-14 16:21:42 is it just the recognition that, if we abstract the properties of the commodities *as products of labour*, we are unable to tell what labour went into making them, which necessitates an abstraction of labour itself? Am I just over-complicating things?

236 2018-06-14 11:46:18 I cosiddetti "cartelli" sono sempre esistiti. Ciò vale, oggi, anche per le altre commodities (Polietilene e Polipropilene) nonché per poliammide, benzina, gasolio,  ecc. La commissione europea si occupi di cose ben più importanti.
237 2018-06-14 11:43:36 Rotich is banking on Tax Laws (Amendment)  Bill, 2018, to raise funds which could increase the cost of basic  commodities and income taxes. This means Value Added Tax (VAT) reforms will culminate in reclassification of zero-rated products to exempt status. #BudgetKE2018

#BudgetKe2018
246 2018-06-14 11:09:47 @KBCTelevision #BudgetKe2018 I believe basic commodities such as food should be the cheapest because it doesn't make sense to me increasing tax on such lest we want more death stories of starvation. People are struggling to even afford a mandazi on the table.

255 2018-06-14 10:46:52 Cost of basic food commodities milk,unga,bread etc will go up and this has a ripple effect which leads to increased poverty and more kenyans living below poverty line,gok has refused to seal revenue leakages and expand the tax base and opted for overtaxing kenyans #BudgetKE2018

261 2018-06-14 10:18:21 Listening to people's opinion about this #BudgetKE2018 everyone wishes that the price of some basic commodities would be decreased. Looking at an addition of 500 billion on the budget, it means more borrowing + higher taxation. we need to embrace for tougher economic times ahead

280 2018-06-14 09:12:52 They lack economic research on the elasticity of increased prices on various commodities obviously . They thought, maybe, sweetened drinks are very much like cigarettes and alcoholic drinks.

282 2018-06-14 09:00:05 What I love about this is, regardless of opinion on whether the decision is good or bad, the club finally trusts an individual manager's judgement and is backing him.

327 2018-06-14 06:35:29 For an inflation targeting MPC - the hike seems rational. The tax cuts, trade policies combined with commodities are the ones primarily driving up the inflation - but the global GDP more or less is constant (policy created demand pull inflation).

355 2018-06-14 04:35:52 #SugarBaronNoor I just don't understand whose apell our country is under even basic commodities gava inanyamaza tu as we get poisoned. Who will come to save this country. GOD SAVE US FROM BAD LEADERSHIP. Nasikia kuhama lost confidence in my government to act
356 2018-06-14 04:16:07 #Healthcare isn't a commodity; healthcare is a right! Commodities are exchanged on a competitive market where there are clear winners and losers. A loser in our healthcare system is either dead or saddled with insurmountable debt. Universal healthcare protects families.
357 2018-06-14 04:02:42 Trump’s actions have the potential of creating devastating consequences for basic commodities like soybeans, wheat, corn & rice and other agricultural live stocks.
358 2018-06-14 03:48:56 I am here imagining how the prices of commodities  will increase  like maize flour, sugar , milk etc after the budget.
Strong tea your people  are coming.
359 2018-06-14 03:45:40 And just handing out free permits, which preserves the price signal in a perfect Coase environment, doesn’t cut it from net-zero emissions innovation perspective. Dynamic innovation and early output support is needed for more expensive lower GHG commodities.
360 2018-06-14 03:23:10 Great due to digital India- VIJAY MALLYA, NIMO, MEHUL BHAI  etc. Looted public money and runaway from country and we poor citizen paying IT, GST and also highest price of petrol ,  diesel and all essential commodities.
361 2018-06-14 03:19:05 It is after all one of Mexifornia's top commodities
362 2018-06-14 03:16:23 There is no money to put in account.poor and middle  class money going 100% to food , education and health. No saving because this currupt govt increased Petrol and diesel price to sky which lead price rise of all essential commodities.
363 2018-06-14 03:14:10 Egypt used to import beef from the US. We were also big importers of US wheat. But the prices of these commodities are too prohibitive now. We mostly buy Baltic/ Russian now and beef is mostly from Argentina/ Brazil. So I believe it that money is tight.
364 2018-06-14 03:07:50 *Oil prices eased on Thursday, dragged down by rising output, although strong demand and a drop in U.S. fuel inventories provided the market with some support
*Brent crude future were at $76.46 per barrel

365 2018-06-14 03:04:02 books are commodities not texts. there is nothing inside the text. death of the text. only people are real.
366 2018-06-14 02:48:21 The love of money is the root of all evil. (1 Timothy 6:10) Money is a necessity due to property tax, utilities, and commodities. Church financials get murky as you venture towards modernized religion though, I get your point.
367 2018-06-14 02:43:39 What a kick in the guts for CQU, especially Gladstone & Mackay who have been hit SO hard in the drop of commodities cycle. Expect a change in support of LNP rep in Gladstone, you bastard Federal Education Minister Simon Birmingham.
368 2018-06-14 02:40:20 Will the Farm Bill continue conversion of non cropland to traditional commodities ?
369 2018-06-14 02:35:21 Fed raises rates, as expected. Leaves door open to more. This should strengthen the dollar & weaken commodities & yet $SLV is running. WTH?
370 2018-06-14 02:32:22 Trade both for known commodities
371 2018-06-14 02:24:12 Trading Indicies , Currencies , Commodities and the many other things that run the world is an actual skill , that is taught in colleges abroad , don’t hate something you know nothing about . After all .. the world is one big Market Place .
372 2018-06-14 02:13:05 Would be dope to add a commodities trader to the team
373 2018-06-14 02:09:24 Bullmarket de Z o commodities? CL ya te subió 180% de punta a punta en 2 años.
374 2018-06-14 02:05:51 Labor helps produce commodities, but how do you know what commodities to produce and how many? Consumers.
375 2018-06-14 02:03:38 Not as much as we missed drillbits. @AndrewBellBNN @thatchriswong @IanVandaelle from legendary commodities show #peaktv
376 2018-06-14 02:00:27 Among other things such as monopolizing our mediums of exchange and turning our actual commodities into worthless fiat currency.
377 2018-06-14 01:57:47 HE STILL THINKS AND BELIEVE THAT THE KIND OF FARMING HE IS FAMILIER WITH IS THE ONE WHICH WILL FED NIGERIANS, THE IRONY STARTS THE MOMENT HE BELIEVE IN EXPORTING OUR COMMODITIES UNDER SAME PROCEDURES
378 2018-06-14 01:57:46 Lo que más ingresos le genera a este país, desde siempre, son las commodities, sabes porqué se llaman así?? Googlealo así te dezasnas un poco, dale??
379 2018-06-14 01:43:10 ...crédito fácil ao consumidor para aquecer a economia, mas sempre expandir a infraestrutura e fomentar a produção, causando inflação e juros alto. Com a crise instalada, preços das commodities em queda, desemprego e endividadamento do povo, tivemos a maior recessão da história.
380 2018-06-14 01:37:25 Juros subsiados, claro. Quase toda roupa vem da China. Só exportam commodities, porque comida de verdade quem produz é são pequenos produtores
381 2018-06-14 01:36:18 Commodities are the opium of the people.
382 2018-06-14 01:28:34 Curious what everyone thinks and would also appreciate a nice trade ideas. Besides commodities if there was one ticker you would go long right now what would it be? This open to everyone 
383 2018-06-14 01:23:23 So if rates are going to the moon cause growth is accelerating why can’t rates make a new high, why are commodities making lower highs and why isn’t value beating growth? When data is as good as gets, forward returns aren’t that compelling. Tick tock
384 2018-06-14 01:23:22 I would tend to say that the real production is at the point it is voluntarily exchanged with another.
Thus high productivity is somehow proportional to the volume received by another. This would include middle men in the exchange of commodities and consumers alike.
385 2018-06-14 01:21:09 NOBODY. CAN. PUT. A. PRICE. ON. YOUR. SHIT. This applies to all commodities...
386 2018-06-14 01:16:07 Do you understand anything about the commodities market?
387 2018-06-14 01:13:55 The financial markets, eg. stocks, bonds, interest rates, commodities, gold & currencies have been fixed by major financial institutions time and again.

Especially anything that competes with central bank issued fiat, just look at the gold market.

There is that too..

389 2018-06-14 01:10:23 Oh and Dan Bilzierwhatever sold off at around the same time? Not calling it shady at all but what was their analysis at the time? I’d be curious because of their general finance knowledge with stocks bonds and commodities. (I just couldn’t spell Dan’s last name right)

392 2018-06-14 00:57:36 Make it illegal to do for betting. Dogs are treated like commodities, problem is it's a money machine.
393 2018-06-14 00:47:31 Yes there surely is, we would be allowing the home office to arbitrarily “turn the tap on and off” to wreck families and lives. FOM is in itself a good thing available to all. People are not commodities.
394 2018-06-14 00:45:05 I don’t see Netflix heading to zero. Not many other organizations that are producing quality products. 

You only need to head to zero when you produce commodities.
395 2018-06-14 00:44:14 If your inflation thesis is right, then definitely commodities.
396 2018-06-14 00:41:29 Sectors punished today:
Home builders $XHB
REITs  $VNQ

Sectors showing strength:
Commodities $USO $SLV $GLD
397 2018-06-14 00:41:14 You also know the main reason dairy farmers haven’t pushed or lobbied for the hormone is because they have no real reason to have it. They don’t have to worry as much about cop since the profit margins aren’t as tight as other commodities
398 2018-06-14 00:39:58 Yes, bcuz I'm poor and all I can afford to eat is fast food  - 'Merikuh!

Just kidding, I cook staple commodities purchased with my EBT card. (still poor) :P
399 2018-06-14 00:37:46 Drugs muddle up your self-understanding, you become a mushroom suckling on capitalist commodities.
400 2018-06-14 00:34:06 Academics are cowards who allow the capitalists to turn their minds into commodities, churning out new commodities (students).
401 2018-06-14 00:32:33 LMAOOOOO ihds Bahamian men are hot commodities worldwide
402 2018-06-14 00:27:43 I'm not saying buy stocks necessarily... I think commodities are a better buy ATM.  I just think this waiting for a crash rhetoric is getting tired. If anything, system is more robust following vol crash

For day to day portfolio rebalance, follow @QuantMaji .  Shameless plug .
403 2018-06-14 00:14:15 "However, let us remember that commodities possess an objective character as values only in so far as they are all expressions of an identical social substance, human labor, that their objective character as values is therefore purely social."
