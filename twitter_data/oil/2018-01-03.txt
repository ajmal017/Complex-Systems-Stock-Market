0 2018-01-03 23:59:58 I love when @Laura88Lee says oil 
1 2018-01-03 23:59:50 Olbas oil is literally a life saver
2 2018-01-03 23:59:46 Sure, but put an oil executive on an oil regulatory panel and they scream bloody blue murder
3 2018-01-03 23:59:41 There's need for conservation of oil, since it's not easily replaced as it is being used up.
4 2018-01-03 23:59:38 ปิดพรีเมื่อไหร่คะ
5 2018-01-03 23:59:36 So amazing to know @JessieJ to join the Singer this year and win the first in the first show! Add oil!

7 2018-01-03 23:59:04 I misplaced my lush tea tree oil for my skin and I’m bout to freak
8 2018-01-03 23:59:03 Nope. Once in the air those babies will dry an oil field of kerosene to run a mission. Plus carriers would need proper air cap, and protection... from this perspective having air refuelling is the key. Not so much the carrier.
9 2018-01-03 23:58:58 Coconut oil does amazing
10 2018-01-03 23:58:33 If @BarackObama was to #Tweet "We should #Nuke #NKorea, set fire to an arctic oil spout, annex Saudi Arabia, refuse #Healthcare to all in need, build plastic-burning electric plants, force all #trans to be an assigned gender...."   I'm sure we'd see who's in charge of #USAll \o/

12 2018-01-03 23:58:17 Get rid of tariffs you are advocating for globalist free trade now? Of course the government had contracts with Standard Oil they controlled almost all of the market. Absolutely ridiculous to think that a free market won't result in monopolies...

14 2018-01-03 23:58:11 I can't decide whether to oil my creaky living room door, or leave it as it is in case of burglars...

39 2018-01-03 23:57:21 I miss the full-serve gas stations in #Texas. They would check your oil & tire pressure, and clean your windshield. You didn't have to get out in the rain or cold weather. I would pay more for gasoline for full service.

41 2018-01-03 23:57:01 That’s actually a sign that it’s truly pure olive oil
42 2018-01-03 23:56:38 your favourite city player pre oil money? some truly brilliant players have graced the shirt.
43 2018-01-03 23:56:37 What are the critical factors for GDP growth in Trinidad and Tobago given that oil and gas prices won’t influence our growth?
44 2018-01-03 23:56:35 It'll be interesting to follow...peak oil in 2040?
45 2018-01-03 23:56:28 Probably enjoy purchasing olive oil a little too much
46 2018-01-03 23:56:21 Took a shower, doused myself in lavender oil, playing cod  feel like a new person
47 2018-01-03 23:56:19 Puttin that oil money to work!  Yeehaw! 
48 2018-01-03 23:56:16 “I was giving myself an oil job.” Must. Resist. Making. Inappropriate. Jokes. #ForbiddenPlanet #TCMParty

50 2018-01-03 23:55:57 Masking carb restriction by needlessly restricting everything else is a lame PR stunt by mostly fat diet experts who gave us now illegal transfat margarine and machine oil rebranded as healthy vegetable oils. Because science.
51 2018-01-03 23:55:56 It's that hot today that the tanning oil on my skin is actually melting 
52 2018-01-03 23:55:56 God i need to go but some coconut oil.. skin dryer then ya mama 
53 2018-01-03 23:55:54 We just got some new *Tangieland- 1g BHO Hood Oil*
54 2018-01-03 23:55:53 I’m upset they didn’t wash my car when they did the oil change. Damn cold weather 
55 2018-01-03 23:55:47 I find cars very hard to digest, seem to be full of oil.
56 2018-01-03 23:55:36 Standoff with the Mexican oil. Only obvious, Tilly wants to dig past the USA & Mexican Border in the Gulf of Mexico. Now, let's ponder about this. Elections in Mexico 2018 Trump is going to get a president he could manipulate. I warned you RIGGED ELECTIONS. They use paper ballots
57 2018-01-03 23:55:31 Is it not remarkable? Simple oil of cloves, and how amazing the results
58 2018-01-03 23:55:26 Mr. Trump. Some history. 1953, USA helps to overthrow democratically elected president of Iran because he was nationalizing there oil. We install the Shah, who was a dictator and terrorized his people. Then 1979 the Mullis takeover. After that, we have tried to mend relationship
59 2018-01-03 23:55:07 They are democrats. Long flowing hooded robes and flaming torches are never a good idea. Especially with all that oil soaked clinton foundation money stacked around the dining room
60 2018-01-03 23:55:06 Sorry miss. I was giving myself an oil job.

#TCMParty #ForbiddenPlanet #Same
61 2018-01-03 23:55:00 Water will soon be more valuable than oil.  We can replace oil but not water.
62 2018-01-03 23:54:56 Unrefined Coconut oil
63 2018-01-03 23:54:47 @Rockriver_Brand your products are really good. The oil and the balm I use on a weekly basis and both are very high quality. I definitely recommend you guys! #Beard #Beards #Beardsman #BeardLove #BeardLife
64 2018-01-03 23:54:44 Clinton's took millions from  Russia & Hillary gave them 20%of our oil but there's no there there.  She carried a big red reset button to ras/Putin but didn't mean it?
65 2018-01-03 23:54:39 I think you spent too much time on those offshore oil and gas platforms. The fumes have gotten to you.

71 2018-01-03 23:53:50 Coconut oil is life
72 2018-01-03 23:53:47 You want to find Burmannii Cinnamon (sometimes called Indonesian Cinnamon) I use it in Old Fashioned’s and it’s got quite a kick. I don’t recommend ground unless it needs to be visible. Go for oil, mixes better and potency tends not to drop off.
73 2018-01-03 23:53:37 Oil based one?  Can't be the pea flour one, because that doesn't work.  I can't do a decent chapati either, only an elecric hob.
74 2018-01-03 23:53:27 Tonight’s a great night for booty rubs with hot oil and anal.

81 2018-01-03 23:51:52 LOL no bacon! Sorry to disappoint! Chicken cutlets cut into strips, san marzano tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and basil.  Served over pasta. OMG DELICIOUS!
82 2018-01-03 23:51:31 Taiwan company rent a ship from Hong Kong, bought oil from Japan and sold it to North Korea. There is nothing to do with Beijing government.

84 2018-01-03 23:51:16 《オリーブ油豆知識》

オリーブ油は、オリーブの果実から得られる植物油である。
85 2018-01-03 23:51:15 I just wanna rub her booty w passion and baby oil
86 2018-01-03 23:51:07 And you're owner makes his billions from steel and energy, no problem with that. Always a perception that oil is evil
87 2018-01-03 23:51:02 And even though your crisis is of course due to deregulation, the ultimate crack was due to war. For oil.
88 2018-01-03 23:50:54 Charles says “I’m hungry for some sesame oil”
89 2018-01-03 23:50:41 In the narrow range of big oil & energy, there is surely some payoffs happening. That's a far cry from a deep state- that requires a lot of people, and therefore is really not that realistic.
90 2018-01-03 23:50:36 Now wait just one minute  RT @The_unaB0mber: If the  a lil dry, just put a lil coconut oil on it. Put to much and you'll mess around and slip to her lungs
91 2018-01-03 23:50:34 Bad ass, you rock
92 2018-01-03 23:50:24 Try oregano oil. It helps me
93 2018-01-03 23:50:15 No just facts women who compare oil changing and cooking get hit and left alone cuz they expectations unrealistic 
94 2018-01-03 23:50:05 Yes. All funded by oil, Carters absurd DeptOfEnergy, forced dependence. The 2nd wealthiest family aside from Rothschild is the House of Saud. Money supporting Radical Islamic terrorism and the cells pour from the Gulf Countries especially Saudi
95 2018-01-03 23:49:33 LFG is short for an oil/gas company I used to work for prior to them being bankrupt. Hard to understand what they mean by that on title if people dont have time to watch video.
96 2018-01-03 23:49:31 I didn’t even see that you replied to me.. but yeah girl I’m tired of my hair breaking off from leave outs n shit. Pony’s and Wigs like u said. And send me a pic of what it look like (the oil)
97 2018-01-03 23:49:16 Good morning Donald, we do not have enough electricity to operate an electric locomotive, as you know even some of our major industries are still using oil. There will be a black out each time a train starts journey to and from Mombasa.
98 2018-01-03 23:49:07 Can't pump US oil without creating US jobs to do it. 
Just saying
99 2018-01-03 23:49:06 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
100 2018-01-03 23:49:00 DT’s insult of  Kim Jong Un’s “depleted and starved nation” is extremely hypocritical. Famines are natural disasters; oil is always needed to protect North Korea’s citizens from their frigid winters. Sanctions depriving NK of heat are cruel and inhumane.
101 2018-01-03 23:48:49 #Gold will go up but not because of any chinese/saudi gold/oil fantasies. Indeed gold is more likely to go up because of a collapse of the chinese debt ponzi scheme
102 2018-01-03 23:48:34 Maar pullup met een rock oil kapsa en its done!!
103 2018-01-03 23:48:28 Our oil is being sold at a steep discount, is it not?  Of course these people are paid to be 'optimistic'.

109 2018-01-03 23:47:04 Global warming is truly made up by Al Gore n his environmentalists w their agenda to make America weak by preventing us from drilling for our much needed oil, n to force ppl to buy their products like electric cars!
110 2018-01-03 23:47:01 Spent $50 on a oil chance and found out I had a free one at Kia 
111 2018-01-03 23:46:58 O’Reilly Auto Parts is the lamest excuse for an auto parts store, my mind is completely razzled. All I needed was an oil filter and they’ve managed to get it wrong two times. What. The. Hell.
112 2018-01-03 23:46:17 Went to get my oil changed and stayed there almost a hour
113 2018-01-03 23:45:55 Also, they are hucksters, taking the taxpayers of KY for a ride while claiming religious exemption for their business. Modern snake oil salesmen who deserve to be run out on a rail.
114 2018-01-03 23:45:54 When price on oil gets up Bitcoin will fall. Global Warming deals by Trump reverses pollution. Trees will die out by lack of CO2.
115 2018-01-03 23:45:49 You can substitute 3.5 grams of flower for a gram of hash oil. Use full flower as a seasoning in your cooking. You don’t need to process it for activating the endocannibinoid system.
116 2018-01-03 23:45:49 Any oil brought into Canada from the middle east is morally bankrupt covering citizens in foreign blood due to USA stealing middle east oil and displacing there citizens forcing the immigration crisis. We are nazies for using that oil.
117 2018-01-03 23:45:45 Gotta waste that Oil money on something I guess.
118 2018-01-03 23:45:39 If NK can accidentally bomb itself, it can accidentally drop a nuke on China. Have the supersmart Chinese figured that out yet? Oil to NK?
119 2018-01-03 23:45:27 my italian ass house really has no damn olive oil. im actually stressing
120 2018-01-03 23:45:10 Venezuela oil basket ends year at highest since 2015http://ow.ly/Pc6s30hzkQU
121 2018-01-03 23:45:10 I've found about 15 of those little Florida lizards frozen to death today. Wonder how they taste sauteed in a little butter & olive oil? #recipes please.
122 2018-01-03 23:45:03 If the  a lil dry, just put a lil coconut oil on it. Put to much and you'll mess around and slip to her lungs
123 2018-01-03 23:44:41 Minerals we can do. Coal, oil, gas, we must be more careful with. Too bad y'all are too greedy to wait for profit from wind and solar & accept that Trump has given the market to China & others. Fools to be so short sighted. You will pay in '18.
124 2018-01-03 23:44:41 US OIL UP! Now that's what I'm talkin' about! MAGA!
125 2018-01-03 23:44:23 tea tree oil is so like tingling& irritating but works wonders #lifeofanacnesufferer
126 2018-01-03 23:44:18 Yes, and shale did well when oil was above $80, but has suffered ever since. Operators have extracted the best spots of US shale and the market is starting to realize not all shale is created equal.
127 2018-01-03 23:44:09 Anyone know of any oil field jobs hiring no experience??
128 2018-01-03 23:43:41 FIXING TO HAVE A 6PM WORK MEETING!‍⛾ MY FELLOW AMERICANS ARE WINTER SNOW DEEP COLD! WHO LOVES TEXAS AMERICAN OIL?

130 2018-01-03 23:43:22 Does anyone know if @Halfords_uk will put gearbox oil in my car for me?  and how much if so? Too patient to wait for my dad 
131 2018-01-03 23:43:18 Thanks @dicapriofdn! Recalling the extensive damage done by the oil spill near Santa Barbara in 1969, more oil drilling off the Pacific Coast isn’t worth the risk. @VulcanInc @MarineBiologyUW @PaulGAllen @EU_MARE @KarmenuVella @MddHyvert

134 2018-01-03 23:42:03 The issue has nothing to do with socialism. The issue in Venezuela has to do with government corruption and a lack of fiscal diversification. The drop in oil prices is what triggered the economic collapse. I know, doesn't fit the socialism is bad narrative. :(
135 2018-01-03 23:41:48 The problem. Europe/UK are dependent on the oil.
136 2018-01-03 23:41:33 It said to rub them on your body with a carrier oil like coconut or almond oil
137 2018-01-03 23:41:27 Just transition to 100% renewable energy for everyone. No new coal, oil or gas projects anywhere.
138 2018-01-03 23:40:54 Yes girl shea butter is the GOAT for my hair! Always makes it super soft and manageable. I was using coconut oil for so long til I realized it was actually drying my hair out 
139 2018-01-03 23:40:52 If he's got the money he can buy what he wants - that didn't bother me. Right now I like financials too- the banks, big and regionals, $PYPL & $SQ. Also oil/gas stocks. I also got back into retail a couple months ago - it had a good run. ER season will tell.

143 2018-01-03 23:40:07 Ha! Truer than it seems.  CA was literally in flames driven by climate change when Trump gave a million acres next door in Utah to Oil&Gas.  Nero anyone?
144 2018-01-03 23:40:06 “Oil ya head “ lmao I’m weak son 
145 2018-01-03 23:39:59 Summary: 1.Public is very long stocks,aggressively bullish. 
2. Monetary policy is tightening, this will accelerate. 
3. Stocks are extremely expensive on many metrics. 
4. Oil / inflation is rising and will accelerate. 
5. Sentiment/ fear is very complacent.
= decide your risk?
146 2018-01-03 23:39:52 Hey James , you ain't no oil painting
147 2018-01-03 23:39:46 GOP needs to stand up for our country before we all land in a crater.
These exec orders to eliminate regs that protect the oceans, land, animals, people all to make more $for his cronies will have consequences I fear disasters like the oil spills &more will come frm this term.

155 2018-01-03 23:38:34 When sector #investing its very common to use the expression . A rising tide lifts all boats.  #semiconductor #stocks are back in vogue. Unless there is a special story most will move up. Same with #Oil & #Banks etc. Identify the sector swings early & you can make big #money

164 2018-01-03 23:37:01 We've always had self/full service. Full usually gets you an oil level check, windshield clean, etc. Full has died off in most of the country for non-use. 2 states don't allow self service by law.

167 2018-01-03 23:36:47 You might want to check out the books by Dr Joseph P Farrell.
There is a Military Industrial Complex and it's hiding away the Free Energy Devices from public disclosure under the application of protecting BIG American Oil Masters.

It's a solid history & not a Conspiracy Theory.

171 2018-01-03 23:36:31 It would be nice to have some alternatives to fossil fuels, then we can avoid being taxed for carbon. But no one wants to give up their precious oil monopoly, so the rest of us get f@cked

186 2018-01-03 23:34:17 Get real. We now have more oil than we need.  Finally a president that will let the oil flow in the USA
187 2018-01-03 23:34:14 Wow, just think of all the life that must have been on #Titan to create all of those hydrocarbons...

...Or is #Abiogenic #Oil a reality?
188 2018-01-03 23:34:05 I remember seeing it a bunch on the east coast as a kid and I thought it was no longer dibe when I got it as a job.

It was a luxury thing, and I did get tips, you would also clean the windows or check oil if they wanted that.
189 2018-01-03 23:33:59 For some reason America likes to claim we are anti-monopolist, yet we “deal” with #Swift, oil cartels, and health care businesses that rig the system against consumers.
190 2018-01-03 23:33:55 I said this back in April, a “Big Emergency” distraction. A no-brainer for 45 + Big Oil both US & Russian + Republicans both elected & unelected.

194 2018-01-03 23:33:23 Exactly a year ago police were raiding my home and seizing cannabis oil.  Bcos of that raid.. ppl have died. Many ppl. And in that year we STILL haven't managed to get easy legal access in this country. Ppl cant wait. I wont wait. I wd rather be illegally alive than legally dead
195 2018-01-03 23:33:22 Just spent all of my Christmas money on a new tires and an oil change! I love that the bills never end and I love 2018 and I love adulting!!!!
196 2018-01-03 23:33:19 Re: oil, the lady said, "any time between today and next Wednesday." So am obviously hoping for delivery before that. 1/4 tank should last 2 weeks here. I think.
197 2018-01-03 23:33:16 The movie “Armageddon” is on tv. The film where the worlds smartest people thought it was a better idea to train an oil rig crew to be astronauts - rather than train astronauts to operate a drill. 
198 2018-01-03 23:33:12 can anyone who knows a lot about skincare tell me if oil or foam cleansers are best because I’m hearing mixed reviews on both
199 2018-01-03 23:33:07 Are cheaper essential oil diffusers still as effective? If you have one u love drop it below 
200 2018-01-03 23:32:54 Again you are trying to mix oil and water. The Church of Climatology of Latter-Day Gaiasts has nothing to do with science and observed history.
201 2018-01-03 23:32:49 Nope. Corporatism is the result of capitalism wildly out of control where corporations dominate the political discourse. A century ago when huge monopolies were raping America finally laws were passed to break up monopolies. Standard oil was one of the first...

212 2018-01-03 23:31:00 Our province has a sort of communal corporate Stockholm Syndrome. I swear many Albertans would let oil and gas companies operate tax and royalty free just for the opportunity to toil for them.
213 2018-01-03 23:30:52 He's using them as an excuse to start a WAR!  He cares about oil, period.  He stands with Jerusalem ~ who fears Iran.

230 2018-01-03 23:29:07 When that happened to me, I'd have a bulletproof tea. Chai tea, 1 tbs coconut oil, 1 tbs heavy whipping cream, and a little stevia.  Lol or I'd just eat cheese.

235 2018-01-03 23:28:05 He has no history with it?  The bit about Iran being robbed from oil comes from a paper that is UK and socialist. The rally was a general rally that the dudes turned up too- the other was an event held by a political group. Not really State run those three things.

239 2018-01-03 23:27:40 I miss having someone say, "fill 'er up?" We lost that in Australia many, many years ago. As a result my tyres, oil and water only get checked once in a blue moon.

247 2018-01-03 23:26:45 Keto tip#5
MCT oil

MCT (medium chain triglyceride)oil can be a wonderful addition to your Keto diet.  It's a great source of fat. I love to add it to my coffee. 

If you have never used it, ease in.  It can be dangerous for those ill prepared .  Limit to 1tbsp at 1st 

YW

252 2018-01-03 23:26:07 @cathmckenna This is pretty alarming stuff. The loss of sea ice will become an open invitation to begin oil operations in places that were heretofore impossible to consider. As well it will surely cause increasing ocean levels and flooding. #cdnpoli #environment #climate #cdnpoli

257 2018-01-03 23:25:25 I used to call it an oil change, but I like the idea of making sure it’s up to code. Showing up in a hard hat to my next one.

265 2018-01-03 23:24:45 All the scientists are just part of the scam? Or maybe, just maybe, it's the people being openly paid by oil companies.
266 2018-01-03 23:24:43 Yaaa after the army finishes dealing with ‘criminal elements surrounding the President’, I think they should turn their attention to these mushroom Prophets!

305 2018-01-03 23:21:08 Hey.. my friend and fellow patriot just opened a new account.  Follow @Rodrollin and welcome him to the #TrumpTrain
306 2018-01-03 23:21:08 Thank you so much for making this Dracky! @DLPBadger sure does leak "oil" everywhere when working on his little fisher price cars :P
307 2018-01-03 23:21:03 Don't you mean "....give us the Arab oil money"?
308 2018-01-03 23:20:50 @VinnieTortorich Tried MCT oil in the coffee but after 3 weeks stomach was still nauseous after use. Should I give it more time or try something else? I heard it could take time to get used to.
309 2018-01-03 23:20:48 You could put the oil in food or I just squirt it straight into my dogs mouths lol. They also make it in dog treats
310 2018-01-03 23:20:37 We are like oil and water. Its so unhealthy...

313 2018-01-03 23:20:00 ha ha ha! you like my joke survey?  if this drops the long squeeze will be brutal.. but i suspect insiders are looking for an unstable Iran.. they are buying gold and oil
314 2018-01-03 23:19:59 Happy Birthday, @natjenkss!!! We’re celebrating by having our oil changed. Woo hoo!
315 2018-01-03 23:19:53 It used to be Oil of Ulay, as I remember me mam using it 
316 2018-01-03 23:19:38 All aboard the Trump train.            #MAGA baby
317 2018-01-03 23:19:36 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
318 2018-01-03 23:19:32 Right! I just got an oil change only to get a new one 
319 2018-01-03 23:19:26 Would that be the beautiful clean oil? How proud we will be!
320 2018-01-03 23:19:16 Lol to each his own but I've had someone change my oil in such a short time and it saved me money but that's not my point shit went way over y'all heads as always lol

322 2018-01-03 23:18:47 I have your book in queue, looking forward to it! sorry for an off topic question but how close would you estimate putin/kim jong-un? it seems they've exchanged over oil/missle tech.
323 2018-01-03 23:18:41 何か鋭利なものが迫って来るという悪夢を見たのですが、おそらく昨夜の君の名はの何度も登場する電車の扉が閉まるシーンを、先端恐怖症なので仰け反りながら見ていたからだと思います。
324 2018-01-03 23:18:14 it's so pretty and cloudy out. I love when the sky looks like a divine oil painting
325 2018-01-03 23:18:09 I remember last night, playing Senran Kagura, watching people transform and get naked, or getting attacked and having them lose clothes, and I remember thinking,

"I should really connect oil to my factory in Factorio..."

So I did! That solved my plastic bottleneck.
326 2018-01-03 23:18:05 Suncor says its 4th quarter daily oil production in 2017 was 736,000 barrels, nearly matching its record 739,900 barrels per day during Q3 2017 #oilsands
327 2018-01-03 23:18:04 1. Yes, but there's no obligation to JOIN.
2. Yes, probably. Common Weal has done the numbers on how to create the reserves.
3. What is Scotland's current economic state? Relatively high employment, rising health and education stats, rising oil price. All look like good signs.
328 2018-01-03 23:18:00 You’re right  put the coconut oil to use then
329 2018-01-03 23:17:46 Buy Irish beef. Pat dry before lightly browning in small batches in either fat/butter/oil. Brown not Burn !! Thicken with a roux later if u need to
330 2018-01-03 23:17:40 #FremontCadillac must enjoy transferring my calls to the abyss. They can turn an oil change into a week long maintenance extravaganza. 
331 2018-01-03 23:17:20 @ColleenB123 (your ig story) put olive oil on it brush it and repeat every other day.
332 2018-01-03 23:17:09 
333 2018-01-03 23:17:02 I’m amazed when people choose to believe the snake oil salesman AND FOX news (which was designed to promote right propaganda) over international news sources and our own FBI. Maybe it’s time you opened your eyes and stopped parroting everything you’re told to believe
334 2018-01-03 23:16:57 I need to get an oil change. My gas mileage is trash right now.
335 2018-01-03 23:16:56 Not at all. IMO Trump did endorse the wrong candidate.
I blame McConnell for the Moore loss. McConnell hates ALL conservatives because they stand up to him.
336 2018-01-03 23:16:53 Some say that drinking warm milk helps, some say lavender oil is great. Worst case scenario, sleeping meds?
337 2018-01-03 23:16:25 I’m sorry, but these people need to wake up and realize that oil jobs aren’t coming back. We need to kick our reliance on fossil fuels

Global Climate Change is real, and we have to do something about it.
338 2018-01-03 23:16:15 #OOTT  Please let me know if you are long oil.  When we get to 100% that's when I will short.. this survey runs for 3 hours - so please register quickly.
339 2018-01-03 23:16:15 but the research on CBD oil and what it can do to heal the body is pretty well researched. Have seen some of the findings? Pretty amazing stuff.
340 2018-01-03 23:16:12 Why do you need oil to run the internet?
341 2018-01-03 23:16:04 CIA n name of America destroyed Iran's Democracy n 1953 b/c Iran was going to nationalize their own #OIL we have no business telling them what to do~
342 2018-01-03 23:16:02 Tobes isn’t exactly an oil painting is he?
343 2018-01-03 23:15:57 2 non facts already from reading it.
1. Statement about Iran and countries wanting its Oil is pretty accurate considering US and UK did a coup for oil.
2. Another one rally that Corbyn went to in Trafalgar square in 2002 was not just for the dudes it highlights, they turned up
344 2018-01-03 23:15:46 Stir together 9 tsps gumbo with 3 pints donuts. Adorn with  Olive Oil. Bake for 30 minutes at 200 degrees. Serve over basmati rice.
345 2018-01-03 23:15:09 Is sherry flip an omega 3 fish oil?
346 2018-01-03 23:15:03 Poke holes in an eggplant, grill it until it's charred and soft. Scoop the guys and mash with olive oil and garlic (grill the garlic in foil too if you want). Finish with salt and lemon juice. Sweet and easy baba ganoush, eat with flat bread, crackers, crispy veggies, whatever

351 2018-01-03 23:14:13 Can you imagine them in speedos wrestling in oil ? There’s an image you can sleep with
352 2018-01-03 23:14:12 Interesting you can't bring yourself to address the issue by definitively stating that US foreign policy regarding Iran has no root in getting their hands on oil and their currency
Iran will conduct its own politics, foreign meddling is only in the interest of the foreigners

365 2018-01-03 23:12:41 Stop the madness. Pretty soon you'll be growing a beard and putting oil in it to make it shiny.

367 2018-01-03 23:12:20 :( I just got over the flu and left my house for the first time in 8 days....if it’s like the one I had try gargling with warm salt water and a few drops of oil of oregano, take lots of vitamin D & C too! Hope you’re better soon 
368 2018-01-03 23:12:17 Yesterday, I finally got my oil changed after delaying it for 2 months.

Today, I received coupons in the mail for 10$ off an oil change.
369 2018-01-03 23:12:10 U.S. recently hit an all-time high in #crudeoil production. #Russia just posted a 30-year high in #oil production and a meager few 100s bbl #OPEC is suppose to matter.
370 2018-01-03 23:12:00 Your cbd content is 1.7 so double or triple the amount of thc in the oil.

381 2018-01-03 23:10:58 looks like a USSV Rhino GX based on A Ford F550 ..  Build in California by hand for rich Chinese... First series is from 2015 ... You build these kind of cars when oil is dirt cheap ...
382 2018-01-03 23:10:48 Just found out I have three extra mouthpieces, Valve oil, and polish rags in my junk drawer and like where did these come from?
383 2018-01-03 23:10:47 Maybe if they focused on renewable resources, they'd stop dying in coal mines and oil rigs. This is probably why a party that focuses on renewable energy doesn't want a career in a finite resource, like your grasp of logic.
384 2018-01-03 23:10:42 I have tried it, but the oil is very expensive. The dried plant matter is cheaper and $50 lasts me a few months. I smoke a few times a week and no seizures, no other meds either. But I realize not everyone can go that route.

389 2018-01-03 23:09:58 Good point, we keep olive oil and regular vegetable oil, too.
390 2018-01-03 23:09:58 FINALLY checked out this bulk food store St. George's in Doral...new favorite. Was able to grind and bag Brazillian bourbon coffee, bottle my own chili olive oil, and bag my own yogurt covered cranberries, chocolate covered cookie dough, and some pralines for $20 
391 2018-01-03 23:09:55 Brett, you lie as easily as you breathe. You just want to sell people your personal brand of canbabis oil, which cures everything because it just does.
392 2018-01-03 23:09:51 Ogx extra penetrating Argan oil
393 2018-01-03 23:09:31 Yea u need to find a pure cbd oil. They have plenty that still have thc in them. The massage oil I use is pure cbd and honestly the best
394 2018-01-03 23:09:23 Ohhh thanks! I actually bought a wee oil and moisturiser from there but I’ve not started using them properly yet  I put it on once and my face was so soft!! 
395 2018-01-03 23:09:18 oil ocean act one is the jam
396 2018-01-03 23:09:16 I do not know if it would show up on a test. CBD oil contains negligible amounts of THC and has none of the "high" that comes with it. Cannabis remains in the body for around 30 days, so a positive on a test doesn't necessarily = impairment. Tricky issue.
397 2018-01-03 23:09:16 and notely suddenly loves oil sales revenue. Leeaapp
398 2018-01-03 23:08:50 Isn’t it an odd feeling to let someone else change your oil? I’ve bought oil and filter and taken the supplies to an independent garage to let them do it.
399 2018-01-03 23:08:49 Yep, high heat and oil. Got about to smoking and forgot to turn down. Sigh. Good thing I have SOS pads! Thanks!
400 2018-01-03 23:08:46 Keep your heads down ladies...
401 2018-01-03 23:08:17 Similarly, it appears that Russia and other similar modern states have such difficulty collecting sales, income or business taxes, they TOO must rely on state industries for income, the biggest of which is OIL, for funding even government.
402 2018-01-03 23:08:15 A lil sun & coconut oil and you’ll be back on glow
403 2018-01-03 23:08:14 All I know is under Obama my salary decreased 10 percent gas and oil prices tripled as well as food prices and property tax I don't know what fantasy land your living in. I got my first raise in 8 yrs as soon as Pres.Trump took office!
404 2018-01-03 23:08:06 You don’t say? At least that is the narrative pushed by see eye aye against #Assange Anyone with research abilities disagrees with snake oil salesmen labels. By all means, tell us what you label @micahflee as then?
405 2018-01-03 23:08:00 To heal a pimple quickly, apply tea tree oil on pimple every few hours, and apply vitamin E oil on the spot, about 1 hour before bedtime.
406 2018-01-03 23:08:00 went to work caught up on emails got my oil changed picked up a package took out the garbagetime for a snow day
407 2018-01-03 23:07:47 Im also of the belief that Sutter would be a better option if they could agree to terms with him .. he's got alot more to show for his efforts than Todd ... it wouldnt be the first time the Oil have dumped a coach to pursue someone else

It goes back to importing middle east oil, while not drilling in the USA.

412 2018-01-03 23:07:04 Fine glitter in baby oil. Beware it is a mess that will never go away. Glitter is abrasive too so it can hurt to scrub off 
413 2018-01-03 23:07:00 Just had to get my brakes changed &’ an oil change . 
414 2018-01-03 23:06:46 Soooooo impressed right now. I will always go to @jiffylube for my oil changes! They even vacuum and wash your car for free. My kinda place  #oilchange #2017Hyundai
415 2018-01-03 23:06:38 It’s a fad thing of coffee with butter and some kind of triglyceride oil
416 2018-01-03 23:06:35 Nope. I have a small one like that. Overheated with oil in it? SOS pad will get most of it gone.
417 2018-01-03 23:06:06 Nope and btw @TomSteyer is the asshat hypocrite who’s been trying to run oil companies out of CA. (You know the ones your parents depend on) FYI he made his fortune from the coal industry-
418 2018-01-03 23:06:04 Think it's oil glitter and some pva glue
419 2018-01-03 23:06:03 Ugh. Fish oil burps 
420 2018-01-03 23:05:31 .@ToyotaCanada just crossed 115,000km on my 2015 carolla, never needed more than an oil change. Fantastic car!
421 2018-01-03 23:05:29 Oh God..I...I...mean I really don’t know what to say on this!! Oil, Oil...who’s got the Oil
422 2018-01-03 23:05:21 Foolishness. If one were seeking out to the highest bidder, oil barron have more to offer and are more difficult to trace. Ask the Clintons.
423 2018-01-03 23:05:14 Models: How do you make the watery glitter? Or glitter oil?
424 2018-01-03 23:05:11 And 99% of the time it’s usually another resource, most of the time that’s oil

431 2018-01-03 23:04:36 Except the Shah wasn’t put into power to stop this “communism” it was Iran’s decision to nationalize their oil industry so (surprise) the British and Americans wouldn’t monopolize and drain Iran of its main resource. But fuck that America gets what it wants.

434 2018-01-03 23:04:30 buy squalane oil and use it on your face/hair/body, i swear your life will be forever changed. it’s the best oil because your body naturally produces it, so it’s absorbed quickly & deeply by hair and skin.
435 2018-01-03 23:04:23 one of my resolutions was to make those oil pens but no joke none of the amazon retailers ship to norway and i can’t find the ingredients at a store please help
436 2018-01-03 23:04:20 @realDonaldTrump Keep in mind the Turkish Empire NEVER taxed observant Muslims, only Christians and Jews. Therefore religion-based Muslim states NEED a state run oil business to fund govt operations. They will NEVER think as WE do.  They cannot.

Global warming has stopped... it’s snowing in Florida, Montreal can now import record amounts of oil by leaky tanker up the St. Lawrence from overseas, cement factories are booming in Quebec & Alberta’s economy is destroyed. You did it!

452 2018-01-03 23:02:52 Omg musta been some of that "surrogate alcohol" from 2016, almost entire Siberian village drank scented bath oil! Wow!
453 2018-01-03 23:02:51 Cheers mate. I've been without the oil for the past 4 days. Honestly, it feels like im falling apart

456 2018-01-03 23:02:12 I thought it was 3rd! Yup Edin & Glas can GIRFUT! She loves it, has a flat nearby now, with a friend. I have to say I’ve no idea how it’s affordable. She had an uncle who was a Texas oil man, he passed away. No kids, aunt is still alive. 
457 2018-01-03 23:02:10 I haven’t gone all meet like the Eskimo’s , but have gone on a high fat medium protein low carb diet which has been wonderful. Butter, coconut oil, and animal fats are the best.
458 2018-01-03 23:01:43 This killing will continue as long as the U.S. continues to depend on (dirty) oil paid for w bodies that are  shipped home in bags
459 2018-01-03 23:01:31 I woke up sick today and @johnnoel042 told me to drop my essentials oil down my throat  oh ok

Nope
461 2018-01-03 23:00:58 person: h- 

me: no but seriously coconut oil will solve like 99% of your problems and lower stress levels. It literally fixes everything
462 2018-01-03 23:00:50 I'd say that adding more oil would probably make it more shelf stable, but who are we kidding? That stuff ain't gonna last long enough for it to matter. :)

464 2018-01-03 23:00:39 Y'all young men be on this bitch demanding a female to know how to cook but I'm gonna need you niggas to know the basics about CARS! Learn how or be willing to change oil! Learn how or be willing to change a tire! That one sided shit dead this way !
465 2018-01-03 23:00:38 Vienna-based consultancy JBC Energy estimated demand for heating oil in the United States will rise by 90,000 barrels per day in January and February compared to a year earlier
466 2018-01-03 23:00:27 and some people became emboldened by the past election.  two factions which benefit from this: tinfoil hat folks aren't being called on their b.s. and all the damn snake oil salesmen crawling out of the woodwork.  JA is a snake oil salesman by action alone.

471 2018-01-03 22:59:26 Morata should go to Prophetic Healing and Deliverance Ministries to have his feet washed with holy water and anointed oil.

473 2018-01-03 22:59:18 Bathe in oil or shower in vinegar?
474 2018-01-03 22:59:14 I used to hate them until I had them roasted. I like them oven roasted w/ olive oil, garlic salt & pepper. Can drizzle balsamic vinegar on them when they're done or a little grated parm.
475 2018-01-03 22:59:12 Yo my dermatologist told me that our faces are sponges that can only take in 33% of what you put on top of it. So layering product after product does nothing once the first has already been absorbed. Expensive moisturizers are a hoax and Avocado oil is the key. Save that $ bbys
476 2018-01-03 22:59:03 As you could probably tell I have never been NI yeah you would think it would be at huge oil companies
477 2018-01-03 22:59:00 Hi love! I would try our Soak and Float Shampoo Bar. We pack it with cade oil which helps to soothe irritated and sensitive scalps; leaving you feeling calm and relaxed!

Governor Romney,  please run for Senate in Utah. We need to bring sanity back to the @GOP (@GOPChairwoman ). 

Then run as an independent in 2020  and unseat that phony snake oil  salesman in the oval office.
483 2018-01-03 22:57:50 At Ikea, buying a new rug to replace the brand new one Clementine ruined by barfing fish frying oil on it (our fault, obv). I can't beat (or bear) the stench.
484 2018-01-03 22:57:45 Olive and shea butter. Coconut oil did little to nothing for my hair.
485 2018-01-03 22:57:28 #SQZ Erskine alone even at only 2,000 boepd is netting $10 million per quarter. The increase in spot oil and gas over recent months is transformational for these small cap oil companies. Then add BKR production of 8,000 boepd net for 2018 and you get an idea of scale of upside 
486 2018-01-03 22:57:17 1. He's not "barely above average".
2. The price was due to the massive inflation of the market, because of dickhead oil clubs.
487 2018-01-03 22:57:13 Gold is holding its own as a store of value- not as some gold centric 2+2 and everything else = gold or gold triangle/Saudi revaluation of oil in gold fantasy/new Bretton woods/gold backed yuan nonsense. The world economy is not based on gold
488 2018-01-03 22:56:58 The only good thing about this arctic blast is that I’ve had the heat up so high that my coconut oil is no longer solidified
489 2018-01-03 22:56:58 Keep up with the thread before you speak.....the initial challenge what 'what else do we do' Not sure why people like you live in Alberta & think oil and gas is about all you are good for. It's a great industry, don't get me wrong....but it isn't the only one Alberta's capable of
490 2018-01-03 22:56:47 New tires and an oil change. You gotta treat her right 
491 2018-01-03 22:56:44 If you put a Labour government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in 5 years there'd be a shortage of sand.

A perfect example of socialist nationalisation madness, Venezuela, which has the world's largest oil reserves. 

Under Socialism, Venezuela is now out of gasoline.
492 2018-01-03 22:56:33 Knowing how real weed smell light versus oil or laced weed or moon rocks
493 2018-01-03 22:56:31 I I were Pruitt I’d grant a waiver only if they write 100 times in longhand “I will not attempt to block natural gas pipelines into New England ever again, and I will praise the oil industry each day for the blessings of fossil fuels and the human ingenuity to exploit them."
494 2018-01-03 22:56:30 Thank you for standing by Trump regardless of his tweets, actions and words. Thank you for allowing Big Money donors to write a tax bill that naturally favors them and cements a permanent ruling elite. And thank you for taking away public land and giving it to Big Oil and Coal
495 2018-01-03 22:56:12 Oil leak in my car to start the year what a treat xx
496 2018-01-03 22:56:02 Avoid damaging the natural oil in your hair. Peroxide, alcohol and bleach are known to strip oil from the scalp and hair.
497 2018-01-03 22:55:54 Never waiting till the evening to get a oil change ever again
498 2018-01-03 22:55:31 No just lay over a few times. Seen the airport & approaches. Always blown away by the number of oil tankers waiting in the Gulf. 
And the islands, of course
499 2018-01-03 22:55:29 my hair is loving me more now that I take time to moisturize it everyday with tea tree and jojoba oil . let’s see if the hairline will accept my love back offer .
500 2018-01-03 22:55:19 I have one square of 85% a day. Anything higher than that I can’t deal with, at least not pure. Maybe melted with coconut oil and raspberries would make a good fat bomb... 
501 2018-01-03 22:55:18 I just stopped putting heat to it. Only think I put in my hair is like Shea Moisture. But I will try the hot oil treatments & see if they work also.
502 2018-01-03 22:55:06 What makes a capitalist democracy like Venezuela a socialist country?

Is it because they nationalized a bunch of foreign-owned oil companies?
503 2018-01-03 22:54:59 Have not heard this one before , but if it is true then I would rather put crude oil on my hair or even drink it than using urine .
504 2018-01-03 22:54:47 First time this season oil money fans
505 2018-01-03 22:54:33 Sitting here waiting on my oil to be changed. A news station on, and there is a panel of people telling the viewers how to think..Sheesh America, read the story and think for yourself. Also this guy just fist pumped next to me. It was subtle, but it was there.
506 2018-01-03 22:54:24 We can’t eat oil
507 2018-01-03 22:54:06 I turn 26 in two weeks. 

Anyway, my mom just told me to “remember to put oil in the pan” before I scrambled eggs.
508 2018-01-03 22:53:59 Citronella & tea tre oil mix with water in a mister and use
509 2018-01-03 22:53:49 @HelloFresh is gonna have me buying stock in olive oil pretty soon 
510 2018-01-03 22:53:46 I don’t bother to even try to reason with them anymore. It never ends well. At least in my experience. I only reported one Lib who told me “drop dead sweetie”. Ugh! It didn’t violate T rules. Go figure.
511 2018-01-03 22:53:45 Two hour oil change wait at Walmart means I have to get creative.
512 2018-01-03 22:53:42 Yeah, but when I'm dog tired, I do long for the days when the man would come out and say "Check your oil and water, Maam?"  Then, make sure the windshield was clean, and tires at the appropriate pressure ~ don't you?
513 2018-01-03 22:53:42 I really got a kid from detail doin oil changes wit me cause this man really walked out lol
514 2018-01-03 22:53:35 Oil cunts.
515 2018-01-03 22:53:27 FACT: According to the discovery of electricity in the 19th century, nervous systems used oil.

517 2018-01-03 22:53:17 Sorry, Always liked @SebGorka. So what has he said that made you recoil? I must have missed something.
518 2018-01-03 22:53:14 I discounted the gas given they have fixed prices. This calculation is just for the oil production which is c. 3000 bopd
519 2018-01-03 22:53:10 Not in oil terms it's not
520 2018-01-03 22:52:55 Never happens in the Jamie Oliver videos. I even used 'Sainsbastards' stewing steak. Can't work out how you fry dry beef in 25g of butter & 2 tbsp of olive oil but end up with 300ml of bubbling water in the pan? @sainsburys
521 2018-01-03 22:52:55 *He understood...gently lowered the top edge of the towel a bit, raised the bottom of it by folding, and warmed some more oil in his hands, then worked on her lower back* I'll get to your legs in a few moments..

524 2018-01-03 22:51:37 Couldn't lace Costa's boots. They won't win the league with him up front. Poor touch and turns like an oil tanker. Real wouldn't have sold him if he were that good
525 2018-01-03 22:51:28 Dear people who sell magical oil,
If there’s an oil that can change a whole persons outlook on life, there must be an oil to help me stop craving Taco Bell. Sos. 
Love, a desperate soul.

528 2018-01-03 22:51:17 I need a oil change 
529 2018-01-03 22:50:52 Yes. I'm sure there was never any plan to win the election, but to damage in every way the Clinton presidency, sew discord in alliance with the same White Nationalism Putin fuels elsewhere. Markets are manipulated and oil wins. It's not about ideology. This is organized crime.
530 2018-01-03 22:50:45 I was reading about it in the flyer I got and it did actually suggest eating a spoonful before dinner if your dietting because it curbs your apetite and you don’t eat too much! and yasss I’m gonna order some along with lavender oil!!! can use that at night then too X
531 2018-01-03 22:50:39 Cleaning my room and I found a unopened gram of oil I had bought when I moved back to Darrington  stoned Betty is always looking out
532 2018-01-03 22:50:39 Welcome back!
533 2018-01-03 22:50:31 After reading Matt Drudges tweet,then President Trumps statement, and Trump Jr tweets,then going to Breitbart and seeing they posted the same article with no rebuttal. I’m leaning towards Bannon really did say this and his time is over.
534 2018-01-03 22:50:25 YOU DON’T BRING THE OIL ONTO THE PLATE
535 2018-01-03 22:50:12 wow, actual hygienic practices instead of sitting in your own pool of filth and oil. I’m proud of you babe.
536 2018-01-03 22:49:48 Pay for the Iraq War with oil...sounds familiar.
537 2018-01-03 22:49:22 If you deliver oil wanna come to Litchfield?Rymes won’t be here for three weeks,and that’s a long time.
538 2018-01-03 22:49:22 @realDonaldTrump can’t keep selling the people snake oil if I they believe in real science and medicine.
539 2018-01-03 22:49:12 @daynavettese Yes i'm in Dartmouth the place that lost all the power on xmas in the woodside cow bay region.They tore the oil refinery down which acted like a wind block.Euro wind graphics are very concerning for Halifax, they have not let up.Well im prepared to camp out for days

543 2018-01-03 22:48:50 They fry the veggie burgers in the same oil as the chips in the UK (as far as I'm aware).
544 2018-01-03 22:48:47 I swear my sister so slow she put oil where the anti freeze goes 
545 2018-01-03 22:48:34 The future is solar, wind and hydro not oil or coal. China to invest £292bn in renewable power by 2020. 50 countries including Germany have agreed to use only renewable energy by 2050. Many more heading in same direction, they know renewable energy is future not fossil fuels.
546 2018-01-03 22:48:33 You are all grifters. Conmen. Selling snake oil. Rot in hell.
547 2018-01-03 22:48:23 After oil was discovered in US it was used for awhile as a tonic to cure all manner of illnesses.
548 2018-01-03 22:48:17 Oh me too but they’re not actually that nice to the skin. My skin is way nicer if I use a drop of coconut oil.
549 2018-01-03 22:48:17 When 99% demonstration was BRUTALLY ATTACKED, I didn't hear any foreign Government claiming "THEY WERE WATCHING" the American Government's response. Are they planning "Operation Iranian Liberation" which = OIL?

556 2018-01-03 22:46:58 $SHP $SHP.CN Over 8 million volume for Shoal Point Energy today. News coming for oil drilling permits in Newfoundland? Anyone have any info on this? Currently sitting at $0.01
557 2018-01-03 22:46:58 Making speech against North Korea and Pakistan, another advanage of taking the oil!
558 2018-01-03 22:46:43 You could be long for the last month as export data and inventory data suggest inverse price correlation.... but I do agree that a cold winter starting now is not good for oil prices come April.
559 2018-01-03 22:46:34 Iran has oil
560 2018-01-03 22:46:33 literally finally got round to buying some coconut oil today!! and yeah I’m the same thats why I’m gonna try and make my own, I’m dead excited to be mixing my own oils and stuff tailored just for me

571 2018-01-03 22:45:43 It's fascinating to me , in a slow-motion car crash sort of way, to see so many people rejecting fact-based science in order to re-embrace Faith healing, totems and snake oil.
572 2018-01-03 22:45:26 My grandparents once took me on holiday to a railway carriage in a field. I was too small to remember any other details, apart from the toilet being an oil drum with a toilet seat on it

591 2018-01-03 22:43:28 I am so wanting to jump in the shower and literally just lather myself in oil.  I'm so dry with this cold weather.
592 2018-01-03 22:43:24 LOL! What did you add in your hummus? I usually just use chickpeas, lemon, tahini, and olive oil, and it comes out yummy.

609 2018-01-03 22:40:54 This whole line of thinking reminds me far too much of the anti-vax mentality combined with a dash of fad based snake oil marketing that's common these days
610 2018-01-03 22:40:53 Why is oil @$62 a barrel like pls go back down what is going on

614 2018-01-03 22:40:36 Yes and no. Almost all moderns wars have been about greed and/or ego. Whether it be over oil and other resources, or simply about land and lust for power.
Ideologies may have been used to rouse the masses to support those wars,but their initial motivation is simply Greed and Ego.
615 2018-01-03 22:40:34 Great tax plan. Now with new tax plan and all of Trumps deregulation the oil price is above $60 a barrel and climbing who is get the most from tax plan. How does the tax plan help farmers of Iowa. You all gutted the agriculture programs budget.

621 2018-01-03 22:39:51 I take emergenC and oregano oil during stressful times, traveling, & when I feel sick and it works wonders but taking it daily is not friendly to my budget. It's best to just get those vitamins and minerals from a good diet. Relying on supplements is a bandaid.

627 2018-01-03 22:39:10 In my opinion and that of some other countries England can not survive without Scotland. Our oil money is used to prop up infrastructure in England.  Imagine what we could be without the shackles of England

629 2018-01-03 22:38:59 Casually spending my time after work reading a book in the lobby of a Goodyear as I wait for my car’s oil to be changed. 

It’s as exciting as it sounds.
630 2018-01-03 22:38:55 Sweetie, screw your surf boards. Hell was on earth during the Gulf oil spill. Sin is destroying your neighbors homes and leaving them to die on a beach for corporate profit. You think you can preach? Preach that.
631 2018-01-03 22:38:22 Just heard that the cost of a barrel of oil has risen to 61.36, the highest price in 2-1/2 years. I guess my "TAX CUT" will cover the higher gas prices at the pump!
632 2018-01-03 22:38:09 I drove all the way home from the woodlands soaked in hydraulic oil, my clutch pedal is greasier than a Six flags wave pool.

641 2018-01-03 22:37:06 coconut oil is proving to be the best thing ever. don't spend money on those lame moisturizers. but first test it on your skin because you could either break out or be cured.
642 2018-01-03 22:37:00 It looks like after the Kurds did all the heavy lifting against Isis, the administration is abandoning them for a better deal on oil, so why not throw Pakistan under the bus so as to pay for another tax break ?
643 2018-01-03 22:37:00 Boys and their toys......wanted fracking to take off so made oil useless.......for a while

647 2018-01-03 22:36:44 First lesson of 2018.  Do not touch a hot exhaust manifold with your hand. Tank's oil stick is right next to the exhaust (yes they are weird machines).  Reaching to push it back into place and OUCH!

Good news snow as VERY close and only got a small patch of skin.

654 2018-01-03 22:36:03 So my car had really low oil and I had to leave it on the road and walk to my house to get oil and when I got back there were like 4 people waiting to ask if I needed help. Small towns are cool sometimes.

Some people are weak for that sort and they believe the lies.
The same kind that can fall into cults that seem so obvious to the rest of us.

698 2018-01-03 22:30:11 Well. Maybe it could start off on an abandoned oil rig, and then the party would find a ship they'd use to travel the abandoned world while also gathering resources from the monsters they fight to duck-tape the ship together.
699 2018-01-03 22:30:04 Well, that's what I mean, it's all dug out and now sitting on the ground and as buildings. It's not like oil that completely changes to another form upon use, unless it will all rust out in a thousand years... then we're back to square one.
700 2018-01-03 22:29:58 Pardon my ignorance, but what is good for your skin? I used to use coconut oil all the time and when I found out it wasn't actually good I never found anything that made me feel super soft

709 2018-01-03 22:28:51 But we make money from being in Iraq. We are denying terrorists money by using oil for our economical rather than theirs, which helps us and far outweighs the military costs. The reasoning behind our debt is due to a massively abused welfare state.
710 2018-01-03 22:28:45 Damn my car has been taking all my money lately... I guess it was about time cause it’s been like 3 years and I hadn’t had to waste money on it except for oil changes

717 2018-01-03 22:28:28 WESTMINSTER CON  from the oil price but the tax breaks that the UK Government offered the industry. Industry groups and the oil companies they represent will welcome such tax breaks and claim they are necessary, but when I looked deeper into the numbers it seems the UK has
718 2018-01-03 22:28:28 Agree with you on Jindal. Couldn't wait to see him go. We had yucky Vitter, so there wasn't much choice. Edwards' Lt. Governor is a flat out crook. He was involved with the BP Oil spill & came out smelling like roses. They don't call them "spillionares" for nothing.
719 2018-01-03 22:28:16 oh yes please *gets the massage oil out*
720 2018-01-03 22:28:15 Absolutely (if I did have a car I'd get great pleasure from changing my own oil though, I miss helping my dad work on cars)
721 2018-01-03 22:28:10 The UK exported $33 billion of oil in 2015. $30 billion would have had some effect on our deficit. With oil price rise & halving of extraction costs & the simple reality that we have more than other successful countries, the reality is pretty clear!
722 2018-01-03 22:27:59 today i start canibis oil i am supper excited yet nervous
723 2018-01-03 22:27:56 Freshly showered, laying in my new sheets with new socks on, spritzed with rose water, lavender oil in my hair, coloring in my new coloring book with new colored pencils and waiting to make a calzone in my new waffle maker. I AM LIVING MY BEST LIFE
724 2018-01-03 22:27:55 No more tonnes of coconut oil every week x praise the lord x
725 2018-01-03 22:27:52 Yeah I thought New Jersey was the only state with that stupid law, when I was a kid I pumped gas for several months and was told to check the oil and if it was a little low to tell the customer the oil was low and to charge for a quart even if we only used a quarter of a can.
726 2018-01-03 22:27:43 I looks that you hope to make next war to get hand on Iranian Oil reserve. Like all other president from US: make war and if not desired effect leave country in chaos.
Donald go home into your tower, you are stupidest press. US ever had. Your people should start soon impeachment.
727 2018-01-03 22:27:40 wish i could find a #massage place that uses #cannabis #infused massage oil

728 2018-01-03 22:27:27 They didn't necessarily lie... circumstances change..so when oil was discovered in the 60's and early 70's that was pre OPEC oil price shock (thus cheaper prices meant less recoverable)...technology changes, prices stayed high so the facts change.
729 2018-01-03 22:27:07 I've known someone who it's made break out in hives...
For me, helps with pain, anxiety, issues related to being (high-functioning) autistic... And it's great... I smoke it and use CBD oil...
730 2018-01-03 22:27:04 “You haven’t had your oil changed since March...and your last service was July...” Well shit...no wonder my car is having issues 
731 2018-01-03 22:26:53 Maybe an abandoned oil rig reinvented into a shelter of some sort? And the survivors there would end up with a plethora of diseases and conditions unique to oil rig workers? Like scurvy, rashes, nausea, and so on.
732 2018-01-03 22:26:47 I took it just over the counter, so I think 3 times a day tops. I just took it as when needed. 
I was prescribed Fybrogel, Peppermint Oil drops and something else over the course of a couple of years but never Buscopan. I found it great for cramps.
733 2018-01-03 22:26:32 Today has been productive, I went to jury duty and even got my oil changed in my car by myself that’s an accomplishment
734 2018-01-03 22:26:19 @TurnTidePlastic good to see safe and warm in  your synthetic boat and synthetic clothing #plastic wooden boat and oil skins next time

737 2018-01-03 22:25:50 Well More oil to your fore-head 
738 2018-01-03 22:25:46 @Maxsiollun please when can I get your book  'Soldiers of Fortune'? I have read Oil, Politics and Violence. Will appreciate any help
739 2018-01-03 22:25:34 You gonna tip the Oil Changers guy who wipes your tires down?
740 2018-01-03 22:25:33 Venezuela is a 2.5 times larger oil producer than the UK, in/around the world top 10 and in the top 5 or 6 oil exporters...they are currently near starving, the society properly falling apart, fighting in the streets regularly and undergoing a totalitarian power grab by Maduro
741 2018-01-03 22:25:30 WESTMINSTER CON he said: “Four million people live in Norway, 65 million people live in this country, and they have same amount of oil as us”. 
David Cameron made the same joke on the Andrew Marr Show and the fact that both
742 2018-01-03 22:25:21 LOL! But Trump is in awe of Vladimir Putin, who runs Russia, and Russia is providing much-needed oil to North Korea. How about them apples, Pence?

744 2018-01-03 22:24:52 Thays wat up wat a good place to get an oil pen
745 2018-01-03 22:24:48 Israel is wrong, this doesn't mean Saudi Arabia is right. If SA wanted to, they could have pressured the US a long time ago to stop it's support of Israel by leveraging their oil exports.  Now the US only gets around 8-10% of their oil from SA so that's moot.
746 2018-01-03 22:24:38 WESTMINSTER CON A £17bn revenue gap cannot be justified without admitting to Westminster’s historical and significant generational economic mismanagement of Scotland’s oil sector. 
2016 The Times CEO summit, George Osborne explained why the UK is not as rich as Norway when
747 2018-01-03 22:24:24 Should have looked for beard oil and shampoo when I was at target.
748 2018-01-03 22:24:06 Red requires skills though. The kulet(onion,oil and Berebere mix) should be on point.
749 2018-01-03 22:24:02 I think people are moving to those places for the oil/gas jobs.

751 2018-01-03 22:23:55 They'll go out of business pitching their snake oil to such a discerning readership.
752 2018-01-03 22:23:49 Not to argue but back then it wasn’t about democracy but about oil like almost all conflicts in the Middle East
753 2018-01-03 22:23:39 Why Argan Oil cost so much?
754 2018-01-03 22:23:35 UPDATE 6-Oil at highest in 2-1/2 years on Iran tensions, strong demand #energy #oil
755 2018-01-03 22:23:30 I do understand the global fossil fuel economy. Much better than you, apparently. In Iran, everything is run through NIOC, which is the state owned oil company.

I am also pretty sure that the bible is not helpful in this case, Especially as I am an atheist.
756 2018-01-03 22:23:27 Sucks to be hungry stuck at oil change
757 2018-01-03 22:23:26 U like when ur men are drowned in olive oil and lemon?
758 2018-01-03 22:23:15 WESTMINSTER CON The oil sector an representative bodies make overreaching claims about the difference in one part of the north sea verses another and will claim that tax cuts were necessary at this point.
759 2018-01-03 22:23:13 yup says so on the website and apparently the garlic dip in papa johns is too coz it's made with garlic oil but i have me doubts
760 2018-01-03 22:23:03 I was a federal range management specialist for 8 years & worked on #speciesatrisk, #invasiveweed mgt, oil & gas mitigation, grazing mgt, livestock behaviour all on grazed landscapes... best job ever. Still miss it every day!
761 2018-01-03 22:23:00 Have you ever taken a random candid and thought wow someone should turn that into an oil painting
762 2018-01-03 22:22:59 Not from the oil fund. And they don't buy all books published.
763 2018-01-03 22:22:49 The state tax is on the value of oil produced, so some of the increase is the result of higher prices, but mostly it means there is a lot more oil being pulled out of the ground in Texas.
764 2018-01-03 22:22:47 A point I make to all unionists when they spout the oil is bad myth. Why would we continue the same way? Which clearly only benefits the big companies. 
765 2018-01-03 22:22:43 Exactly!! That’s what worries me! I’m going to start using bio oil these next few weeks
766 2018-01-03 22:22:41 It used to be the whole country until the 1970s-80s oil crisis when gas station employees started losing their jobs or had their job requirements reduced to remove pumping gas for customers.
767 2018-01-03 22:22:32 Hope they can breath through the smoke from the oil rigs. Nice sell out.
768 2018-01-03 22:22:18 WESTMINSTER CON How come a small and independent Norway’s revenues are 411 times larger than the UK’s? Norway generated £17,684 billion from oil an gas in 2015, but the UK Government only generated £43 million in its last published tax year.
769 2018-01-03 22:22:15 So much for China's dependence on oil that Canadian pipelines were supposed to feed.
770 2018-01-03 22:22:08 I only use it on 400 max but you can go lower.  I usually wash and condition it the night before and braid it into really tight plats so I don’t have to blow dry it that much. Then before I blow dry it I put a little bit of oil on each section thoroughly on med heat
771 2018-01-03 22:22:02 The starving regime was about to collapse in Iran. Cuba was on its knees without support of Russian and Venezuelan oil money. We could have forced them into submission, but Obama chose to let them of the ropes.
772 2018-01-03 22:22:00 i hate going to get an oil change it’s like they know i’m incompetent with cars this man just looked me dead in the eyes and asked me something and i have no idea what he said but i just said yes because i don’t want to look stupid
773 2018-01-03 22:21:46 @cnnbrk The current Breaking News is  very bad for Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Notwithstanding, the resistance to the Russian Investigation the truth is rising like oil in water. This is good for the American people. #DonaldTrump
774 2018-01-03 22:21:45 Thank you all so much.  I just feel for Cleo.  We've given her her own basket and blankets and want to look after her as much as we can.  She seems to be putting on weight & has a good appetite but with the oil she looks so unlovable.  I really appreciate the help xxx
775 2018-01-03 22:21:27 I hate myself right now for working in warminster. I’m mad as hell my dad waited till 5 to come pick me up cause he has my car cause it needed it’s oil changed. I hate that it’s rush hour traffic so he won’t be here for 40 minutes and it’s gonna take that long to get home.
776 2018-01-03 22:21:21 It's a shame and those days are over I remember when I was a kid and they would open the hood to the car to check the oil refill the washer fluid and pump your gas those are days are over service gas stations and other things were the reason why America existed
777 2018-01-03 22:21:13 Why do I was surprisingly confident in December: "You deserved in our oil changes when are in 2016: Fighting for great game.
778 2018-01-03 22:21:13 Communists-socialists not only steal resources, it’s even worst, they obliterate all means of production (like the Venezuelan national oil company) and ban any form of private property
779 2018-01-03 22:21:12 WESTMINSTER CON of oil, is impacting Scotland’s national accounts.  If being part of the UK is such an advantage how come Norway, a comparable oil producing nation, only saw a fall in revenues of only about 40 per cent when ours fell by 99 per cent?
780 2018-01-03 22:21:11 No Oil
781 2018-01-03 22:21:11 Anyone else think #NorthKorea opening talks with South Korea is a “look squirrel” by China/Russia so they can keep sending coal/oil/gas to NoKo ports?? 
782 2018-01-03 22:20:59 Using cannabis oil to treat my chronic back pain issues was actually what got me off of an opioid addiction...

793 2018-01-03 22:19:41 We live in a total bubble. The bubble normalizes bubble-existence so thoroughly that we can't even imagine better ways of living. We're high on oil, endless waste, piles of debt, and endless war for resources and control.
794 2018-01-03 22:19:34 Nothing like a free oil change 
795 2018-01-03 22:19:33 WESTMINSTER CON world. It’s true the oil price slumped by around 55 per cent.  UK Government revenues fell by 99 per cent, even though oil production rose by around 16 per cent during the same period. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that something other than the price

797 2018-01-03 22:19:24 The wars in the next decade will not be about oil, they will be about Bitcoin. Probably also about heavily limited Lambos.

805 2018-01-03 22:18:45 WESTMINSTER CON south for the Empire 2.0 team. The Unionist mantra is that the fall in oil price has caused Scotland to have a greater deficit than the UK, and this makes sense until you start to realise that oil revenues didn’t fall by the same amount everywhere else in the

830 2018-01-03 22:15:45 This is the elephant in the room that people do not want to talk about.  It is a significant issue and research in this area is pretty weak.  It influences the life of everyone in the oil producing nation and every product imported, exported or sold locally.

855 2018-01-03 22:12:55 I don't think throwing oil on the fire & perpetuating racial division is any way of dealing with it. Also, uh... weird expression there.
856 2018-01-03 22:12:50 That's why they were called service stations, they pumped your gas checked the oil cleaned the windshield also checked the tire pressure and did repairs also, this was back when people took pride in there jobs and themselves

864 2018-01-03 22:11:59 Its always the black girls with dry hair & crooked wigs that seem to be the most susceptible to self hate and yt supremacy. Get some coconut oil, black friends and pick up a few books by black authors (if they've ever appeared on Fox News, they don't count) and you'll be fine.
865 2018-01-03 22:11:58 If you have a juicer or near a juice bar try a shot of ginger, oil of organi, turmeric, cayenne, and lemon. It does NOT taste good but gives your immune system a boost.

879 2018-01-03 22:10:59 Fries are fried in oil that contains beef fat, so not vegan.  Maybe that changes when they introduce the vegan burger?  They need to be explicit if so.  So yay for vegan diet, still booo for vegan ethics.

899 2018-01-03 22:08:50 The itch is bc it's dry, the scar doesn't get the same moisture as the rest of your skin. I use coconut or bio oil in the shower after I've soaped. Rub it on, let it sit for a min & then rinse. Pat it dry. It really helps w the itch (and reduces the scaring too!) Good luck!

905 2018-01-03 22:08:10 @realDonaldTrump @CNBCnow So what good is this tax cut for everyone (not corp USA) when we have interest rates rising, commodities near or at highs, oil 3 year highs..etc..Doesnt seem like a break when any excess $ flow goes right back to the "man" anyways. #thx4nothin
906 2018-01-03 22:07:46 I spent 2 and a half hours cleaning my instrument. I'm going to smell valve oil for weeks
907 2018-01-03 22:07:40 It's an unfortunate consequence no doubt but it won't amount to massive long-term job losses unlike fluctuating oil prices
908 2018-01-03 22:07:20 If I had a ounce of my sister's support I'd be lethal but all my shit come from hardcore hustlin, my parents didn't work with me and my sister's relationship, we're oil & vinegar
909 2018-01-03 22:07:17 I hit 90,000 miles in my car today. Also late for an oil change.
910 2018-01-03 22:07:12 I’m waiting for my car’s oil to be changed and I can see them working on it through a window. 

I don’t know why but seeing it done is stressing me out, like when a teacher grades your paper in front of you.

912 2018-01-03 22:06:47 Should be a good day for #SQZ tomorrow with Forties line pumping oil again and the API having reported a 5m barrel drawdown this week on US crude reserves. Even better on Friday if corroborated by EIA figures also.
913 2018-01-03 22:06:43 I wish I had someone mixing the paint to make this process easier. Damn oil 
914 2018-01-03 22:06:40 Don't be too hard on yourself. Johnson, Gove, et al are snake oil salesmen. They're very, very good at deceiving people; it's what they do. Plus, 85% of the UK press was foaming at the mouth for #Brexit - much of it still is. We should be able to trust them. They're to blame.

988 2018-01-03 21:57:55 People would be surprised what oil is used from other than fuel.
989 2018-01-03 21:57:50 Ugh. The worst. I just bought Nivea (the one infused with almond oil) and it’s AMAZING!! we’ve had a negative windchill for the last few weeks so my skin has looked like a desert
990 2018-01-03 21:57:47 How are oil prices still rising when everything is pointing towards are fall back
991 2018-01-03 21:57:45 Every time I want JUST an oil change, they always wanna offer additional services ... fam, nah just do what I asked lol
992 2018-01-03 21:57:33 Sounds like what the oil and industry said 40 years ago about fixing the terrible safety and environmental that was ruining its reputation.

In other words, why not act with urgency? Why let it drag out?
993 2018-01-03 21:57:28 Lol I thought ludicrous mode was only on Teslas not oil 
994 2018-01-03 21:57:27 How am I supposed to get a oil change this weekend with this weak ass snow on the ground 
995 2018-01-03 21:57:27 I understand it sent the wrong message to our young people. I do however support medical marijuana and hemp CBD oil use and research.

998 2018-01-03 21:56:56 Tell you what, genuinely, if it wasn’t for oil money, right now City would be in the Championship, Pep would be at PSG and we’d be having one of the most exiting, closest fought title races in years. Alas...
999 2018-01-03 21:56:52 Considering Trump’s presidency has been the most #Conservative presidency since Reagan, I find the .@ReaganBattalion very hard to believe!

1006 2018-01-03 21:55:20 Pumping gas is not hard, but I do think it stinks that most states have 0 full service. I did like the option of having oil and air pressure checked when dressed up for work.
1007 2018-01-03 21:55:04 I was blocked the moment I called them out for being run by a #FakeConservative, so you may be right.
1008 2018-01-03 21:54:57 Looks like that of a mouse dipped in oil
1009 2018-01-03 21:54:50 The worse reviews are a bit off, I think.  This couple from Baltimore claimed it still smelled like car oil from when it was a garage? It was a waffle house. Maybe there was a smelly patron? I dunno. lol

1014 2018-01-03 21:53:57 Speaking of my hair and the shit I put in lately I’ve been noticing I  would run out of stuff quickly but I dismissed it cause I thought I was being paranoid but nope yesterday I found my brother digging his raggedy ass fingers in my leave in and using my argan oil

1033 2018-01-03 21:51:25 And if the Flames had McDavid they might be a playoff team. Don't listen to me, listen to the oil sands producers committing to lower their GHGs.

1050 2018-01-03 21:49:16 Does this mean that they will only get a life size marble bust now?:) Is there an actual list of who gets an oil painting? I know the President, VP, Speaker of the House, .. I do not have a problem with people that will still be known 100 years from now.

DOUBLED the loss of life in coal mines?

Perhaps some of those safety regulations you rolled back might have saved FIFTEEN people from dying?

Roll back clean air, water, safety regs on oil wells

1083 2018-01-03 21:45:35 Who cares what are we supposed to do?More talks, more diplomacy?KJU's soldiers are defecting, people are starving, China put troops on the border, S.

1086 2018-01-03 21:45:03 So this is fun if a total stretch:
#MyButtonWorks was not the act of a madman, but nor was it's bluster what got KJU to pick up the phone to SK later that day.
More NKs escaping.  No new oil in sight.  Even the military out in the fields scrounging for food.
1087 2018-01-03 21:44:59 nothing can bring down Oil the way it has been for weeks
1088 2018-01-03 21:44:52 You know the issue is not mainly abt the price but lack of vision and insincerity. 
GEJ attempted to increase fuel price n met resistance while PMB did with less opposition?
How come reduction in global oil price did not translate to price decrease?

1113 2018-01-03 21:41:29 Is the price higher? I remember when I was a kid there was a choice self serve or full service and the full service costed more, they’d check your oil and other fluids if you wanted.

1124 2018-01-03 21:40:12 Yes, the election of Mossadegh on 1953 was widely seen as being the most legal and fair elections Iran ever had. He was secular, opposed by most of the clerical class, but made the mistake of pissing off the British by trying to nationalize Iran's oil supply which they controlled

1141 2018-01-03 21:37:48 I think the better answer is to change the way we treat the resource. Your analogy, though tempting, is flawed. We currently tax the companies on the profits, we need to either set up a public oil company or change how the tax structures work.

1276 2018-01-03 21:21:32 Thanks for the clarification then! Too bad since soybean oil is also not able to be consumed during my #Whole30, but I appreciate your looking into it and explaining.
1277 2018-01-03 21:21:22 Hi there, darling! That's so lovely to hear that you nourished your hair with the Damaged Hot Oil Treatment. And fingers crossed the exclusives make their way to North America in the future! 
1278 2018-01-03 21:20:56 Actually there were five buttons pushed for five waterwalls. Live realy closeby one, the Maeslantkering. All I can say is we're safe, but I'm not blown away with all technology, as in Holland we have to pay taxes to keep dry feet  so better they oil those machines now and then!
1279 2018-01-03 21:20:54 Yes! That's it. You're showing great initiative-
Ah, you need some oil, or you won't be able to get the egg off the mug easily. It took me hundreds of years to get it right, so don't worry,

wh,ere do they keep the oil
1280 2018-01-03 21:20:53 Keep your oil grabbing hands to your self. You don’t seam to concerned about Sudan.
1281 2018-01-03 21:20:40 a whole two months i cut out bad food n when i ate bad again i could literally taste all the oil & salt in the food. 
1282 2018-01-03 21:20:28 Did we take any oil? That was a WMD issue that launched the war. Can you share any stats on how much oil was taken and how much it was worth?
1283 2018-01-03 21:20:27 Try dropping some eucalyptus essential oil in the stream - instant spa steam room!
1284 2018-01-03 21:20:19 Still waiting on that giant tub of baby oil, guys.
1285 2018-01-03 21:20:14 Oil up those codpieces!
1286 2018-01-03 21:20:03 I would so bring u weed and massage ur back with warming massage oil..but it would be hard not to cop a feel...im sorry 
1287 2018-01-03 21:20:02 You can tho bc you don't cook it in oil! It doesn't even make your fingers greasy... just feels crispy
1288 2018-01-03 21:19:57 I’m at Jiffy Lube waiting to get an oil change and all of the sudden I got an airdrop request from the other lady in the room. When I looked up she was staring right at me and said “sorry, I don’t know how to work this thing” 
1289 2018-01-03 21:19:54 K. Nook oil iil
1290 2018-01-03 21:19:38 And to receive 145 MILLION $$ from them! For our  20% of our Uranium!  Ironic HRC + co don’t want us to use our natural resources coal oil
1291 2018-01-03 21:19:23 たっか！
こちらがオッケーしていないのに、無理矢理オッケーした事にする、OKモータース…
1292 2018-01-03 21:19:15 オイルだって、泣きたい時もある。
1293 2018-01-03 21:19:14 That's Putin's recipe  piss + vinegar = oil
1294 2018-01-03 21:19:10 I have just bought enough salad that I could make a nest. A balsamic oil & vinegar nest.
1295 2018-01-03 21:19:07 Yep, tea tree oil just ruins my skin. Let me stick to the basics. Never had problems til I started using this stuff 
1296 2018-01-03 21:19:00 Big oil moving last couple of days $xom $slb
1297 2018-01-03 21:18:57 WHAT A DICK! Hateful morons like you amaze me! And to insinuate that Oregonians don't shower! Oil companies pay you to write this crap?
1298 2018-01-03 21:18:57 I was parked in the street outside my house checking my oil, two separate cars asked something along the lines of if“a young lady like me knows what I’m doing with a big engine like that” I projectile vomited on him.

1300 2018-01-03 21:18:54 I’m literally pampering myself with coconut oil and Lush masks at this hour.. not minding my final presentation tomorrow.
1301 2018-01-03 21:18:40 Lamp oil, rope, bombs? You want it? It's yours, my friend, as long as you have enough rubies.
1302 2018-01-03 21:18:36 self-nominated politicians following him he should put people of Iran first that should be his no1 priority, not financing Syria's war with Isis and Hezbollah and Yemen cause  sympathizing is fine but draining our oil money on their causes is wrong
1303 2018-01-03 21:18:29 Without (fiat) faith in the govt ..thus without a stable currency the idea that oil, or whiskey or butter or Mackie's excellent ice cream would serve as some kind of alternative *Gold* and thus somehow 'back' the currency nobody had faith in is nuts.
1304 2018-01-03 21:18:22 I'm waiting on an oil change and I don't know how long it's gonna take. 
1305 2018-01-03 21:18:11 First lesson in oil painting learned the hard way... get out of the habit of putting paintbrush in mouth between colours. This ain’t watercolour.
1306 2018-01-03 21:18:05 Morata needs anoiting oil, ayikho lendaba 
1307 2018-01-03 21:18:00 Cutting off North Korea's oil is a sanction that will really work.
1308 2018-01-03 21:17:55 Shredders need regular oil and maintenance.
1309 2018-01-03 21:17:45 Says the woman who sold out her state's beauty for OIL!
1310 2018-01-03 21:17:13 You gotta put more oil in the shredder #CrookedHillary
1311 2018-01-03 21:17:13 Going to be rather less beautiful after you start your beloved oil drilling.
1312 2018-01-03 21:16:55 We're just finishing up Freddy King's "Texas Oil: The Complete Federal & El-Bee Sides, 1956-1962" and #NowPlaying Boston's self-titled album!
1313 2018-01-03 21:16:50 Bro, WM taking foreverrrrrr to do my oil change 
1314 2018-01-03 21:16:49 I always wonder if when I say I want synthetic oil in my car if the people really put it or just charge me for it
1315 2018-01-03 21:16:39 US Closing prices: #DOW 0.39% #NASDAQ 0.99% #Ftse100 0.30% #GBPUSD 1.3509 #EURGBP 0.8888 #EURUSD 1.201 #Gold -0.14% #Oil 0.28%
1316 2018-01-03 21:16:33 Don’t bother! Just went there, standards have slipped. Sushi falling apart and food cooked in old oil!
1317 2018-01-03 21:16:08 Hair was Damaged: Dry and unmanageable so I applied Coconut  Oil for about 4 Days 1Day over night and Omg!!! Miracles do exist! My Hair is 
1318 2018-01-03 21:16:00 NYR do an organic defence oil you can add a couple of drops to water in a small spray bottle Daughter who is chronically ill used it
1319 2018-01-03 21:15:56 It's always a great feeling when you take your car in for an oil change and they give you a $1,033.55 repair estimate! I'll set fire to that money pit before putting anymore money into it. I think 8.5k in 9 years is enough!    
1320 2018-01-03 21:15:52 HaHa.  My grandfather always would say, "If a fellow can't pay his rent his landlord will help him out!"
1321 2018-01-03 21:15:44 Yep it's tough being the ONLY oil producing country in the world, where owning oil costs you money ! ! ! ...... it could only happen to Scotland, or is the wool being pulled over our eyes. When oil was first produced in the 70s, they said it would last ten years ! ! .. they lied
1322 2018-01-03 21:15:29 My car feels like a new bitch when her tank is on Full and she gets some oil.
1323 2018-01-03 21:15:26 Hair care, I mix coconut oil & jojoba oil and apply that at least twice a week. And I need to set an appointment with my barber
1324 2018-01-03 21:15:08 I liked a  video from   Vegan Alfredo Potato Bake - NO OIL RECIPE!
1325 2018-01-03 21:15:05 Bottom of the barrel lettuce, 5 pecans, a single cucumber slice cut up thin, missing the carrots that were supposed to come with it, and thrn they didnt know how to make balsamic vinegar dressing from scratch so it was like putting pure olive oil and vinegar on the salad
1326 2018-01-03 21:15:01 It was so cold last week that my truck's oil filter started leaking
1327 2018-01-03 21:14:54 Is that 20 pens in a row cech hasnt saved one? Hes like a big fuckin oil tanker the lump of shit
1328 2018-01-03 21:14:48 最後は２５万でしたよ～
1329 2018-01-03 21:14:38 I hope you eat the garlic cloves too. Love a drippy chilli oil garlic clove, me.
1330 2018-01-03 21:14:34 I can't find my chap stick but I CAN find my large tin of olive oil... problem solved?? #DoesOliveOilHealChappedLips?
1331 2018-01-03 21:14:29 So ur saying that the Iranian people aren't oppressed? (Jailed + tortured for speaking out against the islamic regime? Not allowed to wear the clothes they want? Having their economy destroyed while the country's oil wealth is stolen by the evil regime?) Is that what ur saying?
1332 2018-01-03 21:14:28 I feel so old and washed up taking a Mens 1 a Day Vitamin + Fish Oil + Probiotic Acidophilus Pearls daily now.
1333 2018-01-03 21:14:26 oil and gas over grouse and grass
Wyoming just like AB refusing to protect even smallest plains for this iconic bird on road to extinction.
1334 2018-01-03 21:14:25 Yassss coconut oil fixes everything
1335 2018-01-03 21:14:23 Se puede iniciar un juicio civil por un ciudadano comun y corriente x incumplimiento contractual? Si la sentencia es favorable se ampliaria a todos tal cual paso hace años con el impuesto al gas.oil???
1336 2018-01-03 21:14:18 Note to self: don’t chuck steak into a bubbling pan of oil
1337 2018-01-03 21:14:13 But who gives a fuck? Dude doesn’t have a tenth of the charisma or slick speaking skills that Obama or B Clinton have. But that’s sorta the point. We know that slick snake oil  politicians are part of the problem and don’t put forth policies that benefit the majority of the plebs
1338 2018-01-03 21:13:40 Finna shave and invest in this beard oil
1339 2018-01-03 21:13:21 Why did I think it was a good idea to put oil on in 30 degrees heat haha what a mongo I am

1342 2018-01-03 21:13:10 Good morrow, it's Olive Oil. I've been weighing the possibility if after all these seconds you'd like to get nasty.
1343 2018-01-03 21:13:10 Hillary must have heated up the oil too hot in preparation for all them spirits she was cooking...
1344 2018-01-03 21:13:07 Good for you “helping him out”
1345 2018-01-03 21:12:58 You know you're getting old when you nearly fall asleep in a chair while waiting for your oil change
1346 2018-01-03 21:12:51 Can't believe I've been sleeping on the Mayo and egg with olive oil hair treatment. My hair is stronger.#GirlsTalkZA
1347 2018-01-03 21:12:50 I'm upset! I used to atleast get useful oil change deals and food specials every once and awhile
1348 2018-01-03 21:12:46 最大借金おいくらでしたのん？
1349 2018-01-03 21:12:45 Same to you, Happy Trading I am l have been buying US Oil Services and Health Care. Haven't gone for portable yet!
1350 2018-01-03 21:12:43 Ooh and have a bath with eucalyptus oil/shower gel in there
1351 2018-01-03 21:12:22 @Slomins called to say we are empty for oil, are supposed to e automatic delivery, and no one can come out for 3 days? Slomins is terrible!
1352 2018-01-03 21:12:13 Please join, and join the new oil.
1353 2018-01-03 21:12:04 Jawbone USD.  Blow up US trade deals.  Trade protectionism.  Name your biggest creditor a threat.  Kick the world's biggest energy exporter out of the SWIFT system.  Start a war somewhere that disrupts a significant % of your biggest creditor's oil supplies.  Shall i go on? :)
1354 2018-01-03 21:11:48 i gotta get my oil change asap.
1355 2018-01-03 21:11:29 I have avocado,egg,coconut oil and all that all over my hair and dripping on my face. Very uncomfortable.
1356 2018-01-03 21:11:25 I’ve done oil paintings before but between them being time consuming and all the mediums needed I just don’t have the patience for it. I also only know the BARE BASICS so
1357 2018-01-03 21:11:18 BS, EPL refs need to be deeped in boiling oil.
1358 2018-01-03 21:11:15 I’d use coconut oil a big container from cosco

1360 2018-01-03 21:10:58 @JeremyECrawford for RAI, can Prestidigitation ignite oil? #dnd
1361 2018-01-03 21:10:53 that oil gets the panties wet i swear. women love that shit. thought i was the only one hip.
1362 2018-01-03 21:10:48 @bp22 hi bill, can you tell me how to find total market cap of random commodities? 

I get that oil is 62 a barrel but how can i figure out how many barrels there are?

Thanks!
1363 2018-01-03 21:10:43 I couldn't sleep last night so I put a few drops of lavender oil on my pillow and let me just say, I had such a good night's rest!!
1364 2018-01-03 21:10:27 I love nothing more than when i get out the shower and I’m in my room, applying my coconut oil while watching black mirror and the smell of my eucalyptus wax melts fill the air.
1365 2018-01-03 21:10:26 Agreed, but economics so far don't look good. And using CVS for enhanced oil recovery shouldn't count.
1366 2018-01-03 21:10:16 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
1367 2018-01-03 21:09:59 Previous recessions have been preceded by rising home and oil prices, as well as an inverted yield curve. Investors are completely ignoring the risks built from a decade of the ZIRP experimentation. The #Fed knows this, and it keeps them up at night.
1368 2018-01-03 21:09:58 I don't get why it's so hard for people to put things up... dont worry I'll stock the oil y'all just look pretty 
1369 2018-01-03 21:09:38 Polishing them all with oil by hand
1370 2018-01-03 21:09:28 Old habits die hard, and all that.
1371 2018-01-03 21:09:27 Once upon a time the attendant came rushing out to your car, filled the tank and checked your tires, oil, water, and wiper blades. Gas was 25 cents a gallon and you got a free glass or something with fill up. But at no time was it ever suggested drivers were too stupid to do it
1372 2018-01-03 21:09:23 By that reasoning, the oil companies should just do as they please?
1373 2018-01-03 21:09:16 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1374 2018-01-03 21:09:15 today i renewed my license, registered to vote, & made my own oil change appointment ... am i an adult yet? 
1375 2018-01-03 21:09:10 @nest thermostat should be able to notify me that it is unable to increase the temperature.  We ran out of oil.
1376 2018-01-03 21:08:49 Liberalism by definition is not dominant. You always quote vague nonsense sources to back up your agenda David. Luckily people are getting smarter, one day snake oil zealots will be a thing of the past
1377 2018-01-03 21:08:32 Can’t say this enough CBD oil is a game changer. Esp for anxiety related to PTSD. If harsh government regulated antidepressants / benzos aren’t working maybe natural CBD can. Obviously in addition to a Healthy  Lifestyle.. 
1378 2018-01-03 21:08:21 Wow .... That's disgusting! What us wrong with people!
1379 2018-01-03 21:08:08 They use the money from oil that Westminster squandered.
1380 2018-01-03 21:07:59 If you went to Shell or B.P. as a geologist and they asked you to find and predict where oil deposits are, how would you do so with flood geology? Without using geochronology methods? See if AiG or ICR have any articles on this methodology.
1381 2018-01-03 21:07:43 The US has been able to get away with this only because the dollar remains the reserve currency for oil.  

If/when other countries stop using the dollar, this shell game stops working.
1382 2018-01-03 21:07:41 Also pepboys is hiring two techs for the shop. General work oil changes change tires that kinda thing. PM me for an opportunity!
1383 2018-01-03 21:07:33 kia is the slowest place to get your oil changed at tbh
1384 2018-01-03 21:07:25 Feel like the tea tree oil scent on me is skrong. Wonder if other people are getting a wiff too
1385 2018-01-03 21:07:06 Let's wargame this out. Say a CB/finance min on a given Sunday announces oil is so much in terms of Au. Drops the mic. Hoi polloi out of position. But hey, look at Ag still low. Could not a BTCesque craze develop in Ag post Au reval? It wouldn't maintain such lofty levels, but...
1386 2018-01-03 21:07:06 RT FDD: Statement warns "If you lie repeatedly to USTreasury officials and fabricate documents – all as part of a secret scheme to smuggle billions of dollars in Iranian oil money past the U.S. sanctions net – as Atilla did, then be prepared for consequences"
1387 2018-01-03 21:07:06 Yes he is in a very nice cemetary.  It's just ugly to think he's alone & cold. Btw, 2night, I'm prepared!  Small generator,  3 kerosene heaters to keep us & pipes warm, & batteries for lanterns, oil lamps, even got an electric blanket 4 my son's truck in case
1388 2018-01-03 21:07:02 Shocking that a pipeline going through a #libtard controlled state is being blocked. God forbid we will be able to use our own natural gas and oil. I am sick of beimg overruled by 2 cities. Pittsburgh and Filthadelphia do not represent the true Pennsylvania.
1389 2018-01-03 21:07:01 OMGI’m so sorry to hear that My terrier had an incident with thunder/lightning Lavender oil Young Living Brand worked wonders use sparingly

1391 2018-01-03 21:06:49 The price of oil will explode in 2018
1392 2018-01-03 21:06:40 Bout to drop $400 on tires and an oil change holy fuck
1393 2018-01-03 21:06:39 I was simply referring to the fact that the US and Co only "support" people in countries where there's plenty of oil or gas.
1394 2018-01-03 21:06:25 Im crying in the club again but its ok, i might do an oil change + car wash.

1396 2018-01-03 21:06:13 Actually, you can get quite a bit from a sandwich, especially if someone bit it. DNA and the less reliable bite mark evidence. If it is salty, the salt creates more oil for better fingerprints. But we all know criminals don't keep sandwiches in plastic baggies.

1399 2018-01-03 21:05:49 Oil in IndyScot for dummies - Within the uk, say oil is $56/barrel. $56 goes to uk treasury, and for arguments sake Scotland gets $4 of that. In an Indy Scotland, let’s say oil is only $12/barrel; the full $12 goes to Scotland’s treasury. Still a better deal at a lower price.
1400 2018-01-03 21:05:38 it’s african oil from a market downtown lol i’m not sure how or where you could get it
1401 2018-01-03 21:05:31 Have you ever tried MCT oil in protein shakes I found it helps with recovery
1402 2018-01-03 21:05:23 Me too, below 20% oil, propane not much better. If power stays on we just need oil. And we have an account and agreement with downeast! Where we live is is a horror for these trucks once it snows. Downeast was kind last night, after being on hold 45 min,rude today. Yikes
1403 2018-01-03 21:05:10 Oil dey your head.
1404 2018-01-03 21:05:06 You can make kale tasty by seasoning it with salt, pepper, olive oil, and garlic. Onions actually counteract the bitterness you might find in kale. #eatmorekale #healthyeats
1405 2018-01-03 21:05:03 I’m sure after reading your tweet Earl has flexed three times and poured more oil on his pecs
1406 2018-01-03 21:04:57 Coconut oil is the key to life...
1407 2018-01-03 21:04:54 I need to go get my oil changed go to the mall & get something to eat..I’m just being lazy today
1408 2018-01-03 21:04:39 I think Oil is going to stay around $60+ for much of the year.  Wheat has a lot of room to run.  25% or more for Wheat.  If I can make 10% in the short run I might jump in and out.  I will be listening to you. $WEAT
1409 2018-01-03 21:04:36 If the oil level stays fairly put after a month, then I would switch to checking it every couple of weeks and adding oil as necessary. As long as he watches and adds oil then it should be fine for the time being.
1410 2018-01-03 21:04:35 If I had sent him on his way with words of encouragement like, "Study hard in school and save up for college", would that assuage him or trigger him?
1411 2018-01-03 21:04:29 Rolling back a rule that prevents Oil Spills and Blow Outs like the one we suffered from in April 20, 2010, with the Horizon Spill, that killed 11 workers, which the Gulf of Mexico still suffers from, HORRIBLE.
1412 2018-01-03 21:04:27 Brand of oil ?
1413 2018-01-03 21:04:24 C'mon Fellows I'm talking about an entire field of geochronology that determines where to drill for oil, how to find precious metals and rare earth elements, how to locate uranium deposits. 

Show me how to determine a uranium deposit location using flood geology.

1415 2018-01-03 21:04:11 @SecretaryPerry @realDonaldTrump Why would US subsidize Coal production?

1416 2018-01-03 21:04:04 Win Mch canola up A$2.03/t & EU rape up A$5.82. Support from US soyoil. Expected lift in use for biodiesel in the US. Palm oil up on stronger exports. Canola also oversold. Strong enduser demand for canola.
1417 2018-01-03 21:04:00 Bugs in ears? Yup. Not v often (seen 1 in 15 years) but yeah. Kill it first (drown in oil/local anaesthetic).

1421 2018-01-03 21:03:40 The seal is unlikely to blow out but he needs to measure how much it is seeping. If the seep starts to turn into a stream then he can run the engine low on oil and damage it. I recommend checking oil level once a week to see if it is dropping.
1422 2018-01-03 21:03:39 I think he is. He literally has no other choice..we kept him from recieving oil and goods. I'm pretty scared
1423 2018-01-03 21:03:37 Im never going to a different oil shop again.. cause now since im back at the one i usually go to they taking yearssss

1432 2018-01-03 21:02:45 my new body oil is called pussy, it smells heavenly...i’m very happy with that
1433 2018-01-03 21:02:42 It’s not just about emissions.  Engines need to warm up a little for oil flow and general wear and tear on moving parts.  Of course manufacturers will say otherwise because they will make the repairs.  It’s common sense bout viscosity and moving parts.

1451 2018-01-03 20:59:52 @SearsAuto is out of oil. On my third hour of waiting for an oil change scheduled online yesterday. Waiting for an oil delivery. Isn’t a mechanic running out of oil like a driver running out of gas? Would have been nice to be told ahead of time. This is bullshit. @searscares

1455 2018-01-03 20:59:10 Oil almost through the 2015 consolidation top that failed.  Measured move to 68 if it breaks imho.  About 63.20 is where it should breathe but all the unrest in the Middle East may push it through.  Open mind.

1457 2018-01-03 20:58:07 I have applied several times for General Electric Oil&Gas Nigeria. For quite a time now, but yet no positive feedback
1458 2018-01-03 20:58:05 It's complex. Stick around and I'll tell ya the story.
It involves chicanery and scandalous behavior and coconut oil.

1460 2018-01-03 20:57:43 Ppl still all USD/China/Russia/gold/oil talk is conspiracy & they think it's normal for a reserve currency to play this size of role. The reality is , it's the USD that's the conspiracy. Bringing gold back is getting back to normal.
1461 2018-01-03 20:57:40 Back in the day, when my dad used to get gas and someone would pump it, they'd get you to pop your hood while the pump was pumping...and you always needed oil! Imagine that! Coincidence or conspiracy?

1466 2018-01-03 20:56:55 [consulting handbook] ah that is stage six, which normally comes just after peak oil and just before the war with the eskimos.

1473 2018-01-03 20:55:06 @hoonable Bozi, a favor perhaps? A friend with a 2010 Prius is being told it has an oil leak around the timing chain, 18 hr/$2500 to fix. I don't know that engine, do you know what seal he might be talking about? Any chance it could blow out and strand him?
1474 2018-01-03 20:55:05 Oh gosh gal  Absolutely smother it in oil! Warm olive oil works really well, put some through the lengths for a half hour before you wash it. Then a good hair oil for afterwards! I love Superdrug’s argan oil!

1477 2018-01-03 20:54:42 I’ve now had to have the oil lines replaced 2 times, I’ve had electrical issues, the cover to the steering column has come off twice, the parking brake light comes on when the brake is off. Now it’s at a dealership waiting to be looked at again.

1485 2018-01-03 20:54:10 A good example of that is back before the oil slump Tim Horton employees were making $25.00 hr in Fort Mac.
1486 2018-01-03 20:53:57 still adding to my $CPST position.... over 85 mln in rev's and almost break-even..... impressive turnaround in the making. High oil prices and weaker dollar will boost the company even more!

1518 2018-01-03 20:50:16 And then I'll go to the joint and be in charge of slicing up the garlic, for the sauce for the pasta course, real thin with a razor blade so it liquefies in the pan with just a little oil.
1519 2018-01-03 20:50:14 While all stoves are different, the advice I got is as follows:

1. Brush light coating of veg oil inside of cold skillet
2. Start with low burner for ~4 mins
3. Kick burner up to medium for ~2 mins
4. Sear steaks both sides
5. Move to oven already preheated to 350 for ~4 mins

1523 2018-01-03 20:50:01 If you were going to marinate the meat, I think a sesame oil, garlic, salt, and pepper mix would be nice but I think the juices from the sauce itself soak into beef as it cooks.

1530 2018-01-03 20:49:09 S/o to @emilyylov for giving me a card to save money on my oil change and to @kris_kj99 for driving me while they had my car
1531 2018-01-03 20:49:09 I also meant to tell you that I updated my homemade toothpaste recipe: baking soda, sea salt, tea tree oil, spearmint oil, and water... no coconut oil anymore

1536 2018-01-03 20:48:57 Now that the oil price is a little high diversity in economic is silent am not surprise
1537 2018-01-03 20:48:57 put coconut oil on your hair before you wash it, let it marinate girl  and also, don't use heat on your hair (at most once a month). and plait your hair and/or keep it in a bun often 
1538 2018-01-03 20:48:56 So water’s the problem. Not oil or data.

1541 2018-01-03 20:48:11 Yup, it needs to be drenched in butter - not canola oil or whatever - properly garlicked, and lightly toasted.
1542 2018-01-03 20:47:58 Is this the same Orrin Hatch that supported withdrawal from the Paris agreement while accepting over $450,000 from oil, gas and coal interests and over $ 2 million  from pharmaceutical companies as sees no conflict of interest with his son as a lobbyist.

1544 2018-01-03 20:47:44 No one expects the US to impose a carbon tax. But China, India are pricing carbon already. If Alberta wants new to tap new markets in Asia, then the high carbon-intensity of oil sands crude could be a liability. Or, lower carbon-intensity could be a competitive advantage. Maybe.

1548 2018-01-03 20:47:13 Exactly. or use some other oil.
1549 2018-01-03 20:47:12 1/2 Lecithin is needed so the oil doesn't separate. We tried many types of organic non-soy lecithin but we couldn't find one that worked. Soy lecithin was the only one that performed the way we needed it to.

1551 2018-01-03 20:47:04 Maybe if there was real market competition with retail gas I could believe JKs market setting the price. But I think most Canadians believe price fixing has been going on for decades. Big oil owns every station now. And the CEOs of each are all friends.
1552 2018-01-03 20:46:59 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
1553 2018-01-03 20:46:57 I also got the face oil from etsy. When I used to get facials, my esthetician would use that on me, so I'm adding that to my regimen as well.
1554 2018-01-03 20:46:56 Good, maybe that Doosh-Sandwich can contribute to my oil bill; seeing how it's 0 degrees at night.

1560 2018-01-03 20:46:27 enverdad comprarme ese oil pen fue lo mejor que e podido hacer
1561 2018-01-03 20:46:25 P&G did same thing with Oil of Olay - rebranded to Olay and raised prices, creating new shelf.
1562 2018-01-03 20:46:24 You can definitely tell when you’ve had an oil change. Car ride so smooth.
1563 2018-01-03 20:46:18 Sis you miss the point. Do you realize pollution from large corporations like coca-cola ,chevron,and Murphy oil (who don’t sell meat) are part of the waste crisis that ultimately effects climate change. I’m not even defending meat at this point just get ya facts straight
1564 2018-01-03 20:46:15 Hehehe... Yes.. Now i have a natural hair kit... With shea butter, tea tree oil, rinse out and leave in conditioner
1565 2018-01-03 20:46:12 @seanhannity They still sell Kilz Original, oil based primer, strong stuff.  I had to seal the floors in a house I bought and that stuff about knocked me out!
1566 2018-01-03 20:46:02 Folatil oil dlm jahe sudah sejak dulu tbukti bisa mngatasi problem penyumbatan hidung dan sesak nafas
1567 2018-01-03 20:46:01 That looks like a winter dream!
1568 2018-01-03 20:45:55 Should they stop refining oil? Or stop driving vehicles? Or burning waste?
1569 2018-01-03 20:45:52 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
1570 2018-01-03 20:45:46 Make sure to feed him fresh, real foods! Watch Pet Fooled on Netflix too! Try not to feed kibble if you can avoid it. Or at least offer fresh veggies as treats...green beans, carrots, asparagus, kale, raspberries, blueberries, coconut oil, sardines... list goes on!
1571 2018-01-03 20:45:39 @seanhannity you absolutely can get oil based kilz! Jesus Sean!
1572 2018-01-03 20:45:33 Depends on which definition of crude they think you are. Crude as in cussing or offensive, sometimes. Crude meaning rudimentary, not that I've ever seen. Crude oil, stop being silly.
1573 2018-01-03 20:45:30 Mia got a hold of my Ruby woo mac lipstick and let’s just say thank god for baby oil it came right off of her  #wearenotfriendstoday
1574 2018-01-03 20:45:23 You’re a snake oil huckster
1575 2018-01-03 20:45:14 For split ends: mix 1 egg yolk w/ 3 Tbs olive oil and 1 Tbs honey. Apply to ends 1 hour before washing every 2 weeks. #LongHair #Delaware #DelawareHair #VirginHairObsession
1576 2018-01-03 20:45:08 Ur right about 1 thing.. yes, our politicians have completely, utterly betrayed us 4 the last 20 yrs.

However, the solution isnt 2 hand over what little power we do have left to an even bigger cabal of shysters, snake oil salesmen and--4 want of a better word commies-in Brussels
1577 2018-01-03 20:45:05 I meant to dip my eyebrow brush in my setting spray to pick up a metallic shadow to put in my inner corner but I accidentally dipped it in tea tree oil so now my eyelids are swollen that’s cool
1578 2018-01-03 20:44:53 I haven't tried this but I've heard from 2 people that they just mix baking soda and coconut oil into a paste and it works really well!
1579 2018-01-03 20:44:51 you know they ain't, not whilst oil industry is good business & their pension pot. Must build more roads should be their moto!
1580 2018-01-03 20:44:43 Oil and Gold thinks it’s going to keep going up... cute
1581 2018-01-03 20:44:42 As I said, that's just one article, one story....in the past two years we have had many such announcements. There's a reason the economy is picking up, unemployment is dropping and it isn't from the oil sector.
1582 2018-01-03 20:44:33 Wow. I'd rather have an airfryer I guess. The concept of hot oil scares me.
1583 2018-01-03 20:44:28 Gran pregunta, creo que no queda muy claro eso. Digamos que viene de la lengua d’oïl.
1584 2018-01-03 20:44:23 I pulled up to get an oil change RIGHT in time, four cars showed up after me.
1585 2018-01-03 20:44:06 ya know i sure do give dave a lot of shit, but that man taught me how to change my oil, a tire, how to drive stick, and not to take shit from anyone. he really is the best dad let me tell you
1586 2018-01-03 20:44:06 I am ready!!! I did use some  Grace coconut oil tho to fry the breadfruit, I use that every day.
1587 2018-01-03 20:44:04 Rose and almond oil
1588 2018-01-03 20:44:00 Tarte’s Maracuja Oil gives my face life 
1589 2018-01-03 20:43:54 I think about the way Laura Lee says oil a lot
1590 2018-01-03 20:43:48 Oil soars to $61.73! The year 2018 is very good to this so-essential commodity. See previous (re)tweet for more on that. :-)
1591 2018-01-03 20:43:42 Try opening the a few windows to create a cross draft, only cook using a high smoke -point oil in this case. I cook steaks on my cast iron all the time.
1592 2018-01-03 20:43:41 Does that explain why rubber bangles, oil, water, shoes r sold under having a 'spiritual or healing power' tag? Isnt that day light robbery?
1593 2018-01-03 20:43:39 Oil wti, il contratto con scadenza a febb18 ,oggi tocca un massimo di 61.78..massimi del 2015..da monitorare un' eventuale rottura e chiusura giornaliera al di sopra dei 61.8
1594 2018-01-03 20:43:13 Ahhh so you can run a car that’s pissing out oil? Good to know!
1595 2018-01-03 20:43:11 Check your Transmission oil this morning.
1596 2018-01-03 20:43:11 For aftercare, try using a massage oil
1597 2018-01-03 20:43:05 Never knew putting oil in the pan before making a grill cheese stops the butter from burning
1598 2018-01-03 20:43:03 Civics:22 chapters ;-; kill me xD, Auto is a midterm we jus work on the car, do an oil change and take the tire off and then change the rims
1599 2018-01-03 20:43:03 if a website looking like it’s from the late 90s and a guy as incompetent as the juicero guy are all it takes to convince the rich that toilet water is the fountain of truth then why shouldn’t i sell ghost pepper oil as the manly serum
1600 2018-01-03 20:42:56 @seanhannity playing whoppie and behar talking about @potus' Big Button is going to destroy the world. I thought these were going to destroy the world: Brexit, Trump election, Tax plan passing, Climate change, Oil use, Tweeting, Gorsuch appointed, Immigration Pause. . . #maga

1603 2018-01-03 20:42:44 She decimated coal mining to subdue the unions and squandered oil revenue in tax breaks for the rich . She  didn’t differentiate between SCO or rUK . She was of her time and also 25 years ago
1604 2018-01-03 20:42:31 What a pic!! Looks like an oil painting! Xx
1605 2018-01-03 20:42:13 I hope that if I ever have to call 9-1-1 for an emergency an essential oil person is not the operator. 

Help, I’m hurt. 

Try Lavender.
1606 2018-01-03 20:42:10 The biggest companies that need to do a complete overhaul is the oil companies they are so far out of date and why do we have so many gas mixtures
1607 2018-01-03 20:42:10 I have the craziest dreams man I swear it's the oil.
1608 2018-01-03 20:42:03 Hey Twitter Fam, any of you like essential oils? @GeekandSundry I'm lookin' at y'all, ya LA peeps XD I'm trying to pick what oil to order next and I can't decide I've got a few basics like lemon and peppermint and eucalyptus.
1609 2018-01-03 20:42:02 Shout out to all TLWS out there: The Lost World, True Love Waits, Tavern League of Wisconsin, and the multinational oil and gas company.
1610 2018-01-03 20:42:01 The young dudes that change my oil always make me so nervous
1611 2018-01-03 20:41:53 Boy do I feeI old. I was a gas jockey in high school when we pumped gas, checked the oil, checked the tire pressure and cleaned the windshield for every customer. I think we called it ‘customer service’ :)
1612 2018-01-03 20:41:43 Buy a diffuser and use eucalyptus oil in it.
1613 2018-01-03 20:40:57 I'm gonna get you some really nice white sneakers as a birthday gift and then dip it into palm oil for fun
1614 2018-01-03 20:40:49 No, not less just different. Foreign slaves toil away for imported goods, or cross borders to be exploited. Oil is extracted from conflict zones to fuel transport for food. Dispossesion of sustinence land for capital impoverishes rural people.
1615 2018-01-03 20:40:48 Ayyye Don’t trust those stuff. Sweety just use your nkuto, coconut oil and castor oil. The aburokyire people their weather different
1616 2018-01-03 20:40:37 yeah... oil services are trailing oil co’s (they typically do). But, for me the service co’s are a trade.
1617 2018-01-03 20:40:33 @realDonaldTrump If a country on this world is going to be tried; It is America, the terror state that turns oil, gold, soil, the Middle East into blood, kill children, darken tiredness and the lives of innocent people. Turkey is not ..
1618 2018-01-03 20:40:25 Investing in beard oil was such a smart  move.

1627 2018-01-03 20:39:32 The hazards of not pumping gas correctly...please if you can’t pump your own gas you should be driving a car. Same goes for changing a tire...I’ll give a pass on oil changing but that’s it...
1628 2018-01-03 20:39:31 every day we head out back to our oil pumps and spend three hours cranking out some car juice
1629 2018-01-03 20:39:30 also, geranium oil you can find at muji along with the diffuser

1632 2018-01-03 20:39:19 Also downsizing the monuments for his oil buddies. Let's hope that can be reversed in 2018
1633 2018-01-03 20:39:15 Lets talk oregano oil. How the F are you suppose to make it not burn/taste terrible? Fav. mixers to not make it hurt so much.
1634 2018-01-03 20:39:10 Did Trump realize that his big button isn't a nuke button, it's the "OIL GO UP" big button?
1635 2018-01-03 20:39:05 Well we cannot forget that these giant oil companies like Exxon, Shell, and BP have FAR MORE than enough money to pay these employees minimum wage (which should be higher but thats a separate discussion). They sit on a pile of money, so there is no excuse they couldn't do it.
1636 2018-01-03 20:38:46 funny thing w/ Oregon currently is that they WERE one of the states that had attendants to do this (they'll also wipe your windshield's and even change your oil if need be) but now they don't and people are worried about "pumping" their own gas
1637 2018-01-03 20:38:31 She left the lit oil lamp for last thing to throw.

1647 2018-01-03 20:37:07 i actually don’t know how much hot sesame oil you can make with $15 of chili peppers
1648 2018-01-03 20:37:04 Correction? Aristocrats are from English Lineage? Trudeau’s are from Great Grandfather “Striking it Rich from Oil”? No?
1649 2018-01-03 20:37:02 They said "could" not "would" (a huge difference in meaning) and the prediction was based on falling oil prices which have actually risen by $15 a barrel since the report was given an airing by the all too eager Brit media.
1650 2018-01-03 20:37:00 Don't want to splurge on oil blotting sheets? Take a thin toilet-paper square and use it to blot excess oil on your T-zone.
1651 2018-01-03 20:36:58 He receives money interest for the companies of the oldest  valuable  resource, not the best, and is still on, because he and others promotes those oil companies to remain on and to control and have power.
1652 2018-01-03 20:36:53 don't touch it if u touch it it can spread because it's under the skin!!! tea tree oil can sometimes help but ultimately leave it alone
1653 2018-01-03 20:36:48 Despite not playing great, we should have been ahead in this game. This game is there to be won if we shore up our midfield and keep tabs on Mesut Oil who has ran the show for Arsenal. And please for God's sake take the fucking chances #ARSCHE
1654 2018-01-03 20:36:48 Thatcher stole North sea oil at the same time as she tore the heart of  Scotlands industrial belt, we have never recovered .... now, that was really helpful

1657 2018-01-03 20:36:31 Actually investor-state dispute settlement is half of why the KXL pipeline went through because it allowed a Canadian oil company to sue the US for billions over “lost profits” for temporarily blocking the pipeline

1663 2018-01-03 20:35:59 For breast cancer give Thyme oil a go as well as lemongrass essential oil.
1664 2018-01-03 20:35:58 Chappaqua 1) Energizer Bunny Over-heated, 2) Hillary burning Uranium One Docs, 3) Hillary burning Huma related docs 4) Hillary threw oil lamp at Bill after seeing pedo-island photos, 5) Hillary passed out drunk while cooking. It's one of or a combo of these.

1671 2018-01-03 20:35:15 A3: my coworker who came from oil and gas made a good point on this subject - dramatic but good. If it's a task that creeps into your after hours, ask if it actually needs to happen right now. Will what you're being asked to do affect if someone lives and dies. #SproutChat
1672 2018-01-03 20:35:14 so by metals you mean companies that have physical metal made cyrptocurrencies.. and by oils you mean thc infused oil companies

1679 2018-01-03 20:34:15 This administration wants to drill oil in natl parks so 1% can profit while 99% of us allow this nonsense to continue
1680 2018-01-03 20:34:11 Trump downs cows every time he goes to Mickey D's or Arby's. Steamed and oil fried cow flesh, or has it burnt to a crisp and slathered with ketchup.
1681 2018-01-03 20:34:07 What is used in prepared foods is a basting oil, but is not identical to the product that is sold as basting oil in our stores.  Often when recipes are developed for larger-scale production, ingredient modifications are necessary.

1686 2018-01-03 20:33:29 We Cant Sell Petrol at N145--- Marketers.

Petroleum marketers insist that selling petrol at N145 a litre was no longer profitable as the price of crude oil in the international market has risen and this has a corresponding relation with the price of refined products.
1687 2018-01-03 20:33:14 Well, I thought I was gonna get an oil change, but N Street had cars waiting up to N Street.
1688 2018-01-03 20:33:08 Can we stop talking about racist Britain and talk about how great Scotland will be when wwe leave with all our wealth oh then all the trade deals since they fallow the oil

1692 2018-01-03 20:32:43 It might just need an oil change
1693 2018-01-03 20:32:43 Haven’t used it enough times to say officially, but I think this almond oil may be elite
1694 2018-01-03 20:32:36 China won’t use oil cause of the wars over it, then hrc blasted them for using coal cause its enviro not friendly lmfao
1695 2018-01-03 20:32:32 Made the easiest salad dressing today. Cashew butter, sunflower oil, sirscha sauce all over medium heat then pour over your salad. It’s incredible. You can thank me later #chef #health #NewYearGoals
1696 2018-01-03 20:32:21 @johnkensil I'm trying to save money on My heating bill because I use Oil heat and I know using the oven is dangerous so I'm using the Microwave
1697 2018-01-03 20:32:21 Exfoliate 2-3 times a week, & use tea tree oil all natural  #BlackisBeautiful
1698 2018-01-03 20:31:45 You gotta. I got a few of the Nurium people, but mostly what appears to be some really tacky makeup and straight snake oil weight loss crap.
1699 2018-01-03 20:31:44 oil of oregano, make tea w/ minced ginger/lemon & honey, add garlic to everything (just keep mints on hand!)
1700 2018-01-03 20:31:39 Oh and high strength evening primrose or starflower oil
1701 2018-01-03 20:31:38 Oil change and a new battery... man when they said it rains it pours they weren’t kidding
1702 2018-01-03 20:31:27 When you are a low-skilled 22-25 year old making tons of money in the oil patch, why would you?
1703 2018-01-03 20:31:23 nkuto or baby oil
1704 2018-01-03 20:31:19 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
1705 2018-01-03 20:31:07 Why don't you show photos of oil wells & coal mining operations--would be more appropriate to celebrate Zinke-Trump treatment of the Department of Interior.
1706 2018-01-03 20:31:05 Which oil rig did you fall off ?
1707 2018-01-03 20:30:55 Yeah, that has happened to me, usually i just use barely any oil so it can just make the work, and use a little salt. But still, sometimes it just doesn't work :(
1708 2018-01-03 20:30:50 They have Thundershirts, doggie Xanax, chamomile tabs, and CBD oil.  
We get turnt.
1709 2018-01-03 20:30:40 Probably a game for power, mainly China vs US. McMaster is a known eugenicist, he's involved heavy.

From what I gather he's trying to keep the threat credible to see if China will break, stop the oil supply. China will prob win. 0% corp taxes after the tax bill stops everything
1710 2018-01-03 20:30:28 OIL DIFF: 6.43 -> 6.48
1711 2018-01-03 20:30:20 Don’t drink,have an isle seat,board the plane last,tell flight attendants that you are a nervous flyer,sniff of tea tree oil off a tissue
1712 2018-01-03 20:30:08 How's my new diet regime going? I've got a cod liver oil capsule stuck in my oesophagus. That's how. #NewYear #2018HealthGoals

1714 2018-01-03 20:29:47 Yes we all are at different levels of maturity and spirituality. We have been exploiting Iran for oil too long. Its death.
1715 2018-01-03 20:29:44 Sorry Jim, the word fact and your brand of news do not mix. Oil and water, oil and water
1716 2018-01-03 20:29:40 Yes. Natural gas & oil would dominate if other non-electric sectors' energy use were accounted.
1717 2018-01-03 20:29:35 Seriously need an oil change
1718 2018-01-03 20:29:30 So practically we have gone from a Gold Standard to an Oil/natgas USD standard?
1719 2018-01-03 20:29:29 shorted oil again, slightly better entry, feels better
1720 2018-01-03 20:29:28 What does Canada have to trade other then oil or resources....nothing. We manufacture practically nothing ford plant even left Canada it’s Canada slow death
1721 2018-01-03 20:29:14 The motive is simple, to make change one has to go through the law and policies need to go through the house and senate. His executive orders are for his friends in oil and coal that want money, and we will never get it but stuck with the bill of a debt we will have to pay.
1722 2018-01-03 20:29:13 Meyer lemon olive oil makes excellent salad dressing! Thank you @caycifish for gifting me that olive oil for Christmas. So GOOD!!!
1723 2018-01-03 20:28:43 Oil also up 2%. Why shouldn’t it close above 6120?
1724 2018-01-03 20:28:42 I love bullish players like him , midfield is the engine room. Engine oil is dirty sometimes.
1725 2018-01-03 20:28:40 Looks like all channels are carrying the press circus. I guess nothing else is occurring, like Iranian protests, oil to NK, etc.
1726 2018-01-03 20:28:38 also the shippers and oil tankers.  those with good balance sheets of course
1727 2018-01-03 20:28:37 All Bakayoko has done this first half is sweat profusely, must have applied excess coconut oil.
1728 2018-01-03 20:28:35 Missing a gram of oil after last night 
1729 2018-01-03 20:28:31 When King Idris of Libya was told in the 1960s that oil companies had found oil in his country, he is reputed to have replied: “I wish you people had found water. Water makes men work. Oil makes men dream.”
1730 2018-01-03 20:28:19 He's a snake oil salesman with a PhD.
1731 2018-01-03 20:28:16 maybe you are still tired from freezing in Times Square, try vitamin c & d, chicken noodle soup & got oil massage or week of sunshine vacation in Miami needed!
1732 2018-01-03 20:28:02 What am i even doing. Fuck im getting your oil changed
1733 2018-01-03 20:27:49 much cleaner balance sheet. Cannabis oil.  Canada on track to legalize this summer.  Huge vol buying the stock and calls.  Following the momentum.
1734 2018-01-03 20:27:39 we like oil and water baby we just don’t mix
1735 2018-01-03 20:27:31 We also found this out this fall when we were at the gopher vs beaver game.  It is weird because it is not like old full service where they checked oil and stuff,  they just pump gas.
1736 2018-01-03 20:27:29 Protip: Don't rub peppermint oil on your neck and then rub your eyes.
1737 2018-01-03 20:27:26 idk, worst in the OST for me is Oil Ocean Act 1. But that might be because I hate that zone like fuck
1738 2018-01-03 20:27:19 can I put bio oil on emotional scars
1739 2018-01-03 20:27:15 Running out of oil to burn
1740 2018-01-03 20:27:01 PA still has mom & pop gas stations/garages that pump gas and check your oil.
1741 2018-01-03 20:26:58 No they a small fry with a lot of Russia oil money
1742 2018-01-03 20:26:56 @GaryBarlow you should try Avocado, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, cashew nuts and mixed herbs with a splash of sesame oil, balsamic vinegar and lime essential oil 
1743 2018-01-03 20:26:51 Thanks Chris. It is already several months that I put forward this (very) problematic issue. I hope that either the EIA or the Texas RRC will manage to clarify what is going on. Considering the $ amount involved in oil markets,such divergence must be clarified as soon as possible
1744 2018-01-03 20:26:27 Precisely, Rab. This whole British thing - as they deploy it - is propagandist snake oil spin.
1745 2018-01-03 20:26:07 SELL $SDRL -anyone who can't see writing on wall (Re. imminent Shares wipeout) w/ all 3 ch11 plans is delusional. Simple math in zerosum game $OIL
1746 2018-01-03 20:25:57 lavender oil really helps with burns- learned that in my glassworks class
1747 2018-01-03 20:25:57 I am actually fairly constructive on oil serv names for '18.  all the hype is out of the price and oil prices have marched higher
1748 2018-01-03 20:25:36 Reality is though is that's just Trump and just for the moment. Carbon pricing is a reality of the rest of the market beyond the US and planning in this industry looks out 10 years or more. And you just can escape the production cost or oils sands versus traditional oil operation
1749 2018-01-03 20:25:33 Oil price trades near highest level since 2015
1750 2018-01-03 20:25:27 $sdrl -SELL into this fake rally&avoid waking up to a wipeout any day now. Ch11 offers deadline is past. Doom is very clear in all 3 plans. $OIL
1751 2018-01-03 20:25:17 Seems like you dont know our oil industry very well maybe you should work in it first to gain some insight knowledge from the people that have lived this life and know all about it.  We have product that can’t be sold in return provides a terrible $ investment everybody looses.
1752 2018-01-03 20:25:14 My coconut oil is solid as a rock right now...  it's soo cold.
1753 2018-01-03 20:25:06 It’s because of the oil from the peps after it cooks together. When you take the chocolate chips out the cookies b for they cool, they don’t get the chocolate flavor. Make a batch with and without brown sugar and you’ll see.
1754 2018-01-03 20:25:00 So are the labels on the snake oil you've selling*

*allegedly.
1755 2018-01-03 20:24:55 Rosehip oil >
1756 2018-01-03 20:24:37 SELL $sdrl -

1757 2018-01-03 20:24:26 Love how my coworkers and i will oopenly smoke our oil pen out in the open during our shift..
1758 2018-01-03 20:24:24 Agree that there are some really bad plays, & D men pinching has created too many 2 on 1. Last year, the Oil played a much better support game, this year not so much. Last night, Cuggilano should have been on the ball & covered for Russell & reacted too late!
1759 2018-01-03 20:24:23 Both market share & stock reduction are outcomes of an #OilasanAsset market paradigm driving market price structures. Result is a two tier 'false market' driven by financial demand & subject to a #DarkInventory of prepaid oil
1760 2018-01-03 20:24:19 Yep, I'm sure you can intuit it, but the challenge is actually the logistics of scheduling the oil when your tank is full (i.e. you can't have trucks full of HO sitting there with no place to put it) vs. actually securing the commodity. IME at least.
1761 2018-01-03 20:24:09 Fish liver oil is fixed oil or volatile oil?
1762 2018-01-03 20:24:05 My aunt got me a new oil paint set and some canvases and I’m more excited to paint the little box it came in than a canvas
1763 2018-01-03 20:23:51 Exactly!   that oil money
1764 2018-01-03 20:23:50 I need a new oil diffuser asap, mine hardly works compared to the flow of other ones I've seen
1765 2018-01-03 20:23:37 it’s not straight tea tree oil but it’s like a toner that contains tea tree oil and other oils. also it worked for me over the summer but it completely burned my winter skin which was already dry so that’s probably why ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
1766 2018-01-03 20:23:30 @TalkBeckyTalk can you use Amla oil on blonde hair overnight !? Does it darken your hair? X
1767 2018-01-03 20:23:27 I have been taking cod liver oil tablets daily.
1768 2018-01-03 20:23:21 <—pours coconut oil. everywhere.

1769 2018-01-03 20:23:19 "A loaf of wheat bread or three loaves of barley will cost a day's pay. And don't waste the olive oil and wine."

1771 2018-01-03 20:23:04 do you use the oil morning and night?
1772 2018-01-03 20:22:43 Jared's getting like $1200 worth of work done on my car today and I just feel rly lucky bc I've always struggled to spend the $40 on an oil change lol
1773 2018-01-03 20:22:30 I need to go get my oil changed and get my car washed
1774 2018-01-03 20:22:29 Maybe I need to start a 21-step Korean skincare regimen instead of 11, with at least 3 of those steps being just straight up bathing in a vat of baby oil.
1775 2018-01-03 20:22:10 Jealous.! 
1776 2018-01-03 20:22:06 I remember changing the oil to my cars on the block with my dad now I sit back and let the professionals do it 
1777 2018-01-03 20:22:05 There's a big difference between the sovereign wealth fund of an oil-producing nation that is worried about falling oil prices than a state-run pension fund.
1778 2018-01-03 20:22:01 Depends what you’re looking for. AAG is more academic, GITA is more oil and gas. I like @URISA for the GIS professional development aspect of things. #GISTribe
1779 2018-01-03 20:21:49 The oil in Generac pressure washer should be changed after every 20 hours of usage. RT to spread this #MaintenanceTip

1785 2018-01-03 20:21:31 This happens a lot where I live. Oil production is the biggest industry going, and speaking against even the most unsavoury aspects of the industry just gets "BuT dOnT yOu DrIvE a CaR?!" shouted back at you.

1788 2018-01-03 20:21:18 Has anybody ever tried CBD oil for chronic pain ?
1789 2018-01-03 20:21:00 Is the appropriate time when you can get oil etc out of them?

1796 2018-01-03 20:20:24 and here I’ve been pissed about our subpar education system, lobbyist owned healthcare, continued oil spills & fracking, our non living wage apparatus, our biased prison system, the fucking wars ALL our presidents got us into & how establishment plutocrats like Hillary r 2 blame
1797 2018-01-03 20:20:18 No kidding!  At the start I bottle fed him every 4 hours.  The formula was a heated-up blend of about equal part condensed milk, cod liver oil, & butter.  Took a while to take to nipple.  Began with a urinal catheter run through the nipple, slid it down his throat & squeezed.

1811 2018-01-03 20:19:01 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.

1816 2018-01-03 20:17:52 I got told the "coolant reservoir cap was missing" on an old car I had by an oil change place once. Come to find out, whoever changed my oil and checked the other fluids just didn't put the cap back on....... both they and the second tech who double checks all the work missed it.
1817 2018-01-03 20:17:52 IMO hidden mechanism is wealth transfer that empowers petrostates sufficiently to make them threats to scientific cultures. W/o wealth transfer complexifier, we'd be more inclined to let it go. Let nature take its course. Rich oil states disproportionately empowered, threatening.

1822 2018-01-03 20:17:13 In the 3-2 NHL, coaching/tactics are everything. Winnipeg transitions out of their zone seamlessly with quick passes. That takes practice and chemistry. McLellan’s coaching and tactics have become dated and to extent so has Chiarelli’s notions of what makes a contender.

1828 2018-01-03 20:16:49 US courts are likely to reinforce precedent than 'make law.' Judges don't LEAD but follow. They crave stability, even SCOTUS. Dread Scott, anyone? Plessy v Ferguson? Oil & gas as the Dominate Estate in law? I have more faith in the vote than the courts to 'fix' things.

1835 2018-01-03 20:15:08 Does that mean every American will be wealthy, like all those oil countries? Give me my minons.

1837 2018-01-03 20:14:56 Drain/squeeze well. If frying use very hot oil. Don't be afraid to ramp up the flavour in marinades. Freeze, thaw and crumble for the mince texture. Also don't mistake for silken tofu!
1838 2018-01-03 20:14:47 Ras Al Kaimah Gas is preparing to launch a new oil and has licensing round in March of this year.

1842 2018-01-03 20:14:30 Is anyone among you sick? Let them call the elders of the church to  pray over them and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise them up. If they have sinned, they will be forgiven- Jm5:14-15

1844 2018-01-03 20:13:58 I got an @AnovaCulinary sous vide for Jan for Christmas, and we cooked our first meal with it last night - tuna fish with rosemary, garlic, spices, in one bag, small potatoes with olive oil, garlic, spices etc in another bag. It was amazing. We'll be having sous vide a lot!
1845 2018-01-03 20:13:57 Does anyone else think the transfer market has gone nuts? The oil money ruining the game 
1846 2018-01-03 20:13:57 It is the end of times!! I'm going to try to go pickup peppermint oil tonight for next time if this ever leaves me today. It has eased up a bit but I don't trust it yet

1848 2018-01-03 20:13:30 Aye, your hair’s due for an oil change.
1849 2018-01-03 20:13:28 If you read you will see that I did respond.....do you have trouble with this issue as well? The bottom line is the oil industry is re-aligning global operations worldwide, not just in Canada. Scheer is fooling you into thinking it's a Canada only issue.

1852 2018-01-03 20:13:18 That can be true in certain cases. Look at the fundamentals though. Supply may be increasing but is clearly unable to match demand. US (and global) oil inventories are falling at a rapid pace. US inventory has slashed through '16 & '15 levels and will break through 5yr in no time
1853 2018-01-03 20:13:11 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for a paleo-keto-raw diet, and put some orange zest essential oil in my diffuser.

1869 2018-01-03 20:11:53 Sounds similar! This was in the official Veganuary group. I’m pretty sure they mentioned palm oil too! So bloody discouraging it’s unreal.

1881 2018-01-03 20:10:41 @CaptainFawcett beard oil and beard balm are really good at smell and those have really good care properties too. I think washing and oilin after that should make beard little bit softer. Or I have noticed that.

1893 2018-01-03 20:09:35 Really—look at what's happening with oil recently? And you still haven't confirmed if you think @RossPatchett's "£1bn/yr whisky duties would go to Holyrood" is right or wrong...
1894 2018-01-03 20:09:18 But they don't.....federal taxes are no more or less onerous that any other jurisdiction, regulation is standard. In fact, the oil industry is very highly subsidized in Canada, a courtesy other industry doesn't seem to get as readily.
1895 2018-01-03 20:09:16 Think of your product like an organism—growing, shifting, decaying—not an oil painting; a "finished" masterpiece.

1903 2018-01-03 20:08:29 I’ve tried so much stuff people have recommended (I only started getting acne at like 25 so had no idea what to get). Only thing that works for me is micellar water, pixi glow tonic and an oil free moisturiser. Every two weeks or so I add in pixi rose oil as it dries my skin out

1907 2018-01-03 20:07:54 It’s not as bad as obama taking credit for the low gas prices when he has nothing to do with it. Actually obama was trying to stop fracking and then took credit for how low the oil prices were after the court struck down his fracking rule.

1933 2018-01-03 20:04:07 It is now obvious that he sacrificed National Assembly to shield failure and Nigerians should not expect the fuel crisis to end anytime soon since Kyari cn hold a close door meeting with the oil marketers and peddle lies against National Assembly instead of telling them the truth

1940 2018-01-03 20:03:20 No reasonable Nigerians will expect the @AsoRock to make any request to settle Oil Marketers because we were told that the subsidy money was a big scam.
1941 2018-01-03 20:03:20 Them little oil filled radiator heaters work pretty nicely! And they are pretty cheap too. Probably safer around furs and debris than a lot of other heaters. D: We used one in a barn with animals before and it worked nicely.

1946 2018-01-03 20:02:51 Ear Solution!

Use a dropper to put mineral oil (cooking/coconut oils works too) in ear(s) or dip a cotton ball or tissue in the oil and squeeze it into ear.  Plug it with a price of cotton ball or tissue

Keep it in for several hours or better yet all night.  It helps!!!

1963 2018-01-03 20:01:40 That money was already Iran's. Since the 1980s, due to sanctions against them, they were selling oil without being paid. That money was held by several countries, including the US. It wasn't a gift or a loan - IT WAS THEIRS

The price of oil ended 2017 at $60.12 a barrel, up +12% (and $6.40 a barrel) from its 2016 close of $53.72. The $60.12 price was the first daily close above $60 a barrel since 6/24/15 (source: CME Group).
1971 2018-01-03 20:01:23 My class used a website that had picture passwords and one kid told me his was "elephant, pop can, oil, A, triangle, 17, igloo, tornado, wallet, scissors, mango" and it worked.
1972 2018-01-03 20:01:22 love when I get a fresh oil change
1973 2018-01-03 20:00:58 From Energy Investing board, some small producers report that they are better off shutting operations in freezing weather. It is a real possibility that both oil and NG production may take bigger hits than anticipated.  I am thinking of stripper wells operation.
1974 2018-01-03 20:00:58 OIL DIFF: 6.43 -> 6.43
1975 2018-01-03 20:00:51 @realDonaldTrump Commodity prices on the rise. Oil 3 year high's..Doesn't this concern you considering what $ is saved by "tax cuts" will just be spent on costs of living for the average Joe?
1976 2018-01-03 20:00:48 salt/pepper and olive oil. Nuke it in the microwave for 30 seconds. Add veggies and meat to it. 
1977 2018-01-03 20:00:45 Stainless steel #nameplates are extremely durable, and they can withstand the harsh environments common in the oil and gas industry.
1978 2018-01-03 20:00:45 FUCK I WANTED YO SHOW MY BTS RING AND NOW ITS STUCK

I DONT WANNA USE OIL OR ANYTHING CAUSE IT SCUFFS EASILY
1979 2018-01-03 20:00:41 We should not be paying any country for nothing. Also, the countries we defend should be paying us or give us oil as payment.
1980 2018-01-03 20:00:38 Thank you! This AM I am studying the protective effects of olive oil which are many, including protection vs breast cancer. Some early evidence indicates it could even be effective against the more aggressive HER-2+ breast cancers. On PubMed search “olive oil and breast cancer.”
1981 2018-01-03 20:00:37 I want 5 guys in Texaco uniforms to come out and wash my windows., check the oil, air my tires....
1982 2018-01-03 20:00:32 Hair Growth Tip: Have daily vitamins food such as fish oil or krill oil. It really works. #HairGrowth
1983 2018-01-03 20:00:32 Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Trump, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil. THEY JUST FOUND IT!
1984 2018-01-03 20:00:28 These pre-paid oil changes at the dealership have cost me more in time than I've ever saved. That's the whole joke.

1992 2018-01-03 19:59:58 Iran is quiet. #oil has been way lower during much more serious conflicts in the ME. Current price is not justifiable or sustainable for longf, imho.
1993 2018-01-03 19:59:53 me, two days ago, young and naive: I put garlic in everything I cook with olive oil, so why not just get garlic olive oil

2003 2018-01-03 19:58:50 Cook in pan with plenty of salt and pepper (would add cheese but not vegan), press into baking tray, oil top (not yours...) and bake til firm and crispy. I wouldn't serve it mushy like mashed potato.
2004 2018-01-03 19:58:39 It's the ultimate hipster goal, mix the vintage, cutting edge technology and the socially responsible choice, it's organic oil though so it can only improve your @Tesla

2017 2018-01-03 19:56:28 Should have bought oil instead.
2018 2018-01-03 19:56:27 *special treatment* that in their minds denies them something. They can't conceive that many can all prosper at the same time. Why?

Sorry, I'll take the word of the Pentagon, of the oil companies, and of the climatologists over some deplorable hack, any day.

2060 2018-01-03 19:52:04 Then moisturize. With a natural oil of some kind. Also, exfoliate.

2064 2018-01-03 19:51:50 I'd say it depends... If you're talking raw materials like oils and butters (shea butter, castor or coconut oil etc) then yes its cheaper in Nigeria but imported products def more expensive. There are a couple emerging Nigerian natural hair companies but I havent tried them yet
2065 2018-01-03 19:51:27 Dude.... oil changes are not cheap! I just spent $100 - had to get new wipers because the ones that came with the car were split

2077 2018-01-03 19:49:05 Actually, Norway didn't go into recession in 2008/9 due to its state owned oil reserves. It used to have a very high suicide rate but pumped money into mental health services. People with poor mental health develop physical problams too. That's what helped their NHS

2085 2018-01-03 19:48:03 when government policy and industry innovation create viable options, we will.

2093 2018-01-03 19:46:59 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
2094 2018-01-03 19:46:55 And most of the prize money. Other countries may aspire to be green, but they still buy boatloads of oil.
2095 2018-01-03 19:46:54 Except maybe over 20 military installations in the region, intelligence access/cooperation, more oil than the USA needs and a lot of wealthy customers for the American military-industrial complex. "NOTHING" ain't quite true.

2098 2018-01-03 19:46:43 Everything I've read so far says that nobody knows for sure the real intent. Though I did find out that the blue/orange was chosen to impress Gulf Oil into investing in the franchise. #TheMoreYouKnow

2110 2018-01-03 19:45:36 Oh dear dear, thats why the big companies are out there drilling, you are aware that West of Shetland, oil is in shallow water ??
2111 2018-01-03 19:45:25 Tell Me About...I Barely Drive My Vehicle And The Only Thing It Needs Is An Oil Change And Time Rotation. I  Couldn’t Get The Mechanics To Do That Today So I Will Have To Schedule An Appt. Later This Month.
2112 2018-01-03 19:45:11 So today I dropped my car off at the wrong car shop to get the oil changed... I didn’t know till AFTER I left when my dad called me and I had to go back inside to get my keys and they laughed at me
2113 2018-01-03 19:45:10 "Wonderful!" says Valero about oil.
2114 2018-01-03 19:45:05 GOOD FATS: Avocado, Fish, Almonds, Walnuts, Peanuts, Cashews, Olive Oil, Coconut Oil, Seeds, Coconut, Olives, Peanut Butter, Low-Fat Dairy
2115 2018-01-03 19:44:53 used to be so insecure about my baby smooth hands bc after shaking someone’s hand they would ALWAYS comment on it... but ya know what, in 2018 i’m only bathing in organic coconut oil. how times have changed
2116 2018-01-03 19:44:52 AMAZON HAS A BATH AND BODY WORKS AROMA THERAPY COMFORT SCENTED ESSENTIAL OIL FOR MY DIFFUSER AND I JUST ORDERED IM SOOOOO HYPED OMG
2117 2018-01-03 19:44:45 UK Government's have been plundering murdering & Interning Irish without trial for centuries today its plundering Oil & Gas & Gold & internment the IRA are not fighting because of a peace treaty & rightly so, however the Brits have broken the peace treaty it must be repaired now.
2118 2018-01-03 19:44:44 Anyone have a Young Living essential oil account activated? @YoungLiving2011
2119 2018-01-03 19:44:38 @govsambrownback Kansas KCC has over-regulated Small Producer Oil & Nat. Gas Industry until there's no profit left! Lease & Landowners Lose!
2120 2018-01-03 19:44:31 well, cbd oil (non-psychoactive.) i'm trying to find new/better ways to manage anxiety day to day 
2121 2018-01-03 19:44:30 I’m so scared to take the castor oil  Ima try walking lmao I hope that Work
2122 2018-01-03 19:44:24 You know this boardwalk would be slippery as olive oil on our kitchen floor spilled by teenagers. You know it. #zwifting
2123 2018-01-03 19:44:24 @GameOn2FM my mate has huge guns, and a huge belly he can't see, striod munching mórán, coconut oil chicken now rice is his stable
2124 2018-01-03 19:44:21 I’m waiting for my oil change in lakeland and I’m surrounded by old people who won’t stop staring at me. HELP
2125 2018-01-03 19:44:18 trib's right, peroxide just ups the sacrifice. Might help clear wax (and sounds supercool), but also increases risk of repeat infection. Olive oil if ear is dry or blocked, or GP to flush it out (and they may say olive oil first,as did to me when I had many)
2126 2018-01-03 19:44:14 I’m selling hair growth oil!!! Inbox me if you’re interested!!! #gypsytings #justknow
2127 2018-01-03 19:44:12 darskinned ppl get not representation or coverage in the media unless their shade midnight, ass naked, and doused in oil n gold glitter
2128 2018-01-03 19:44:11 I wish there had been as much awareness when I was first diagnosed with with severe resistant clinical depression in my early twenties. It HAS changed alot...not enough...but having a month focused on awareness definitely encourages people to seek help. Thanks#Oilers et al.
2129 2018-01-03 19:44:00 Go on shilling, though, for a few dollars more toward oil & gas companies’ already obscene profits at citizens’ expense, and pay no mind to the way people spill gas when pumping, an environmental concern. Anything for a laugh! Coda: Really, fuck you.
2130 2018-01-03 19:43:59 That for those who think that 1 mil makes them great, some only need 50K, now to be serious Oil not only that is overbought its extreme
2131 2018-01-03 19:43:57 I just spent $55 on hair products. (Conditioner, Leave In Conditioner, Tea Tree Oil, Coconut Oil, Olive Oil, Curl smoothie, and Curl Defining Creme) Being Natural is a financial commitment.
2132 2018-01-03 19:43:50 When God anoints your head with oil, it doesn't just fill up.
It overflows.

2133 2018-01-03 19:43:44 I'm using the Klair's oil cleanser prior to cleansing, I probably won't try another oil cleanser bc i like that one so much lol. im definitely gonna grab that Nooni cleanser!
2134 2018-01-03 19:43:35 Okay, I'm admittedly naive when it comes to how the oil industry and our country work together. That said, why the hell are we exporting oil when we still need to import it? Is someone buying from our oil producers at a higher price than is needed to import from elsewhere?
2135 2018-01-03 19:43:32 هههههههههههههههههه حلوه
2136 2018-01-03 19:43:31 I wonder if they will also stop selling oil to countries that do not enforce a religion??
2137 2018-01-03 19:43:29 Interesting seeing some #Oilers fans clamouring for Ralph Kreuger. I'd imagine you could find a different tactically inept snake oil salesman for cheaper on Jasper Ave

2140 2018-01-03 19:43:13 We need oil to power our cars, our grid, our businesses, and our economy. Quit trying to keep America's resources locked up!!
2141 2018-01-03 19:43:12 Chef Kawasaki cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was some live hornets, along with grass.
2142 2018-01-03 19:43:12 Brexit the midnight oil

2144 2018-01-03 19:43:11 ICYMI: 2-year high for #Oil.
2145 2018-01-03 19:43:03 hahahaha thats so funny, it was Saudi Arabia who pushed for PRODUCTION CUTS in order to INCREASE the price of oil, you should really take 5 min and READ the article,
SA doesnt care about what the US thinks
2146 2018-01-03 19:42:38 Errrmm.... don't think so.... 70k worcester oil with 110kW pellet on the side.
2147 2018-01-03 19:42:29 What's wrong with cotton? It is renewable and biodegradable. Most alternatives are made of crude oil. Growing cotton supports my family and thousands of other family farms. Only 3% of the world's farm land produces all of the world's cotton. Use cotton, it's good stuff.
2148 2018-01-03 19:42:21 Duduk di emperan spbu dan di ampit oleh motor percis aku berada ditengah tengah nya sambil mengetik ini aku melihat tulisan bright, food and drink dan aku pastikan tulisan itu salah karna didalam toko itu ternyata menjual oli, kan harus nya food, drink dan oil. Cukup cuitan malam
2149 2018-01-03 19:42:15 Pure coconut oil
2150 2018-01-03 19:42:13 That oil money crazy
2151 2018-01-03 19:42:11 *Breathes* Soap is in the mold, I repeat, soap is in the mold! Fragrance oil IS in it this time and changed the soap recipe a little so hopefully it won't come out crumbly like the last one did. Waiting a few minutes before I add the light gold mica. (c)
2152 2018-01-03 19:42:04 Need that $100/bbl oil to manifest that support...  MbS is the key to the Trump.  Why else was that MbS button-man El Erian appointed at NY Fed?
2153 2018-01-03 19:42:00 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
2154 2018-01-03 19:41:59 They are the biggest holders of stocks and shares in the EU, their portfolio is huge, they influence the stock market, but you knew this, just forgot to mention it ..... Here's another two questions 1) Is Norway a rich country 2) Is it because of oil ?
2155 2018-01-03 19:41:56 Same. I’ve watched at most two episodes because his rubbery face smears oil across the rest of the show.
2156 2018-01-03 19:41:55 Do they make straps that dispense coconut oil upon trigger?
2157 2018-01-03 19:41:55 @SecretaryPerry @realDonaldTrump Curious about rumor - why would we subsidize Coal... Isn’t that what Aramco is moving away from with recent Saudi Oil price raise and Aramco IPO? @GregAbbott_TX @GovAbbott
2158 2018-01-03 19:41:48 When other countries are counting on other sources of renewable energy, how we'll be " king of oil" if less & less countries are trying not to rely on it?
2159 2018-01-03 19:41:42 TPP seems like a good idea.  I’m not persuaded by the gravity trade model.  My “made in” labels today: iPhone, laptop, shirt, suit. All from Asia. Heavy cheap stuff might be attractive to source locally due to shipping cost. But not with 59% tariff (beef) or 34% (olive oil)
2160 2018-01-03 19:41:41 What good is being the oil king when it means the irreversible destruction of our planet? What good is $$$ without life?
2161 2018-01-03 19:41:31 Coal and oil are finite. Then what? For years Americans have been told we need to learn to move away from fossil fuels. It's going to run out. When it does, is everyone on the side of these fuels turn around and say "why didn't you say something?"
2162 2018-01-03 19:41:28 We get to spank you're hands, for 35 years with a soaked Olive oil rule stick.
2163 2018-01-03 19:41:27 #Crude oil Jumped 2%..focus on ongc and Aban..
2164 2018-01-03 19:41:25 Gas is short for "gasoline." The name comes from a brand of petroleum called "Cazeline", named after John Cassell and the Greek word "elaion", meaning "oil."
2165 2018-01-03 19:41:17 Takes me a whole tub of gel and some oil to get it to SORT OF lay down only for me to take a selfie & go outside & it go right back lmao.
2166 2018-01-03 19:41:14 It was a Chevy Vega Wagon. Ate oil for lunch, but the thing was a tank. IIRC, CT roads were closed for 5 days. (Storm was Monday, reopened Friday/Saturday). Thank goodness for WNnnnnnnnnnnnBC. #TrafficOnThe3s
2167 2018-01-03 19:40:55 Doing digital oil portraits for $35.00/$45.00 all month. DM or text me if you have my contact info.
2168 2018-01-03 19:40:52 Adaptation of this tech for doing those jobs ppl don't want to do. Imagine a 10 armed robotic fruit picker. Picking at peak ripeness.
2169 2018-01-03 19:40:48 And you know what? I wanted us to pull out of the Middle East after 9/11, but Bush decided that his oil shares were more important than American lives. How’s that for “America FIRST?!”
2170 2018-01-03 19:40:39 And if it created a chemical change, it would no longer be the same liquid so it couldn't technically "dry" the oil from the water
2171 2018-01-03 19:40:37 つちあず寝なさいや
2172 2018-01-03 19:40:36 Well, I’m certainly no oil painting. Lmao.
2173 2018-01-03 19:40:33 Lmao it’s been months since I got my oil changed to the point where the oil wasn’t even on the dipstick and the guys at pro lube are amazed my engine is still running  so that’s great lmao
2174 2018-01-03 19:40:29 Hahaha! You #maga #dupes are mosquitos. Lead tainted snake oil sales man and performance artist really found the perfect marks to sell lead tainted snake oil.
2175 2018-01-03 19:40:22 エルザー　何怒ってんだよー？
2176 2018-01-03 19:40:16 กว่าจะพิมพ์ถูก
2177 2018-01-03 19:40:11 So what. Plenty of oil, yet gas prices going up taking away any tax relief. Just a bunch of Thieves
2178 2018-01-03 19:40:11 Damn live oil trade stopped; have switched long with 35pnt stop, trying within risk profile, as stopped what higher target do you see?
2179 2018-01-03 19:40:09 As much as I love this l*gan p*ul slander I’m really tired of seeing his dry ass mop on my TL!!! Honestly how he gonna be that rich and not invest in some gd argan oil
2180 2018-01-03 19:40:08 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
2181 2018-01-03 19:40:05 I assume that with another 50K on ones side Oil will become so expensive that nobody but mr. Trump would afford it, for pool of course
2182 2018-01-03 19:40:05 Waiting on an oil change/inspection becomes an exercise in torture when cable news is on the TV. Every. Time. #KillMeTwice
2183 2018-01-03 19:39:58 Good! Was just going to suggest oil 
2184 2018-01-03 19:39:40 Which essential oil should I rub on my second chin to make it disappear?
2185 2018-01-03 19:39:32 (1/3/2018) Oil hits 2 year high.
U.S. natural gas demand hits record high.
2186 2018-01-03 19:39:30 My greatest conundrum would be can oil make water wet. I would say so but you've have to evaporate the water from the oil and then condense it to separate the two and I'm not sure if heating the oil would induce a chemical change
2187 2018-01-03 19:39:26 Trump: Small man. Big ego. It's embarrassing. To support a person of this caliber is to approve of a lack of intelligent discourse, facts, or humanity. Trump's character is low. His veneer is that of a snake oil salesman and you expect his product to cure your ailments.
2188 2018-01-03 19:39:17 Ha I don't even mess w oil or gas
2189 2018-01-03 19:39:06 I tell my barber to go 1 on the sides
2190 2018-01-03 19:38:46 He has been multitasking!

Exploding the deficit

Destroying the environment
Selling us out to big oil and Wall Street
More golf

2191 2018-01-03 19:38:43 Just dropped $700 on an oil change & new tires.Adulting sucks.
2192 2018-01-03 19:38:42 Se conosci il settore gas oil dove abbiamo eccellenze mondiali saprai che aggirano i divieti di cartello ogni giorno essere eccellenze non significa essere anche perfetti magari lo saranno io non so
2193 2018-01-03 19:38:40 Oil changed, filled with fuel and left the car wash. Stopping off at home to get a bite to eat then it's on to the Dentist! BTW catching the last hour of "Attack on the 50 Foot Woman"
2194 2018-01-03 19:38:37 Coal, oil sands, then diesel
2195 2018-01-03 19:38:34 How does #Sasol end up with any award? "Oil & chemicals giant Sasol will start public consultations next year as part of a process of applying to postpone compliance with some of the new air-quality standards applicable by 2020." #Polluters #pollution #environmental #Crisis
2196 2018-01-03 19:38:21 Doubt any PJM generators keep more than the minimum around. Having said that, during height of polar vortex our PJM asset managers were checking with oil suppliers everyday and they basically could all deliver significant qty of oil with a few hours notice.
2197 2018-01-03 19:38:04 Was just reading a thread where quite a few people were breaking stalls with more fat! Makes me wonder if it's not fat in general , but coconut oil in particular? (There is a potential theory for it..)
2198 2018-01-03 19:37:25 I've got home made lemon balm oil, rose water, lavender water...&& Idk what else to make lol
2199 2018-01-03 19:37:19 Thats not just motor oil for stains there ...frig
2200 2018-01-03 19:37:15 These old things? I'm bout to throw em away 
With the gold rings that make em don't fit like OJ
Usually take em off with oil or olay
MC's is crabs in a barrel pass the old bay
2201 2018-01-03 19:37:09 Warm some olive oil for a few seconds in microwave and put a few drops in your ear, works a treat 
2202 2018-01-03 19:37:09 I’m Lil Car Oil Change 
2203 2018-01-03 19:37:05 Looks good.  Plus it grows back
2204 2018-01-03 19:37:03 Yes it is disappointment. .....KEEP YOUR OIL BUNNING COMRADE!!
2205 2018-01-03 19:36:52 No doubt he runs in local elections and the like. That type always do. Wouldn't you love to do an Intervention on him where he's Love (suicide) Bombed by all these people he fears? Garnishing him with flowers & scented oil while Travellers throw money at him & sing?
2206 2018-01-03 19:36:35 Where do you all go to get oil changes, because obviously this is something I have to do.
2207 2018-01-03 19:36:29 Ann is above her pay grade.
2208 2018-01-03 19:36:25 Agreed, Alaska needs to be tapped, our major importer of oil is Canada, then Mexico.  Not OPEC or other Muslim countries
2209 2018-01-03 19:36:23 That's obviously @POTUS Donald Trump's plan. Put an end to the Middle East oil cartel that funds terrorists.
2210 2018-01-03 19:36:15 @ibkabiolaralph 
Can you help with locations where oil spill is so pronounced in Rivers State.
2211 2018-01-03 19:36:15 And oil isn’t one of them - it’s had $trillions in subsidies - dressed up as tax breaks - it’s corrupted whole nations and governments and caused $billions-$trillions of environmental costs which others have had to pay for
2212 2018-01-03 19:36:12 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2213 2018-01-03 19:36:08 Aside from beyond way dehydrated, I need a good face moisturizer. AND DO NOT DAY COCONUT OIL!
2214 2018-01-03 19:36:03 what with the US' record of overthrowing Iranian government, stealing Iranian oil and starving them half to death thru' sanctions....you'd think these Iranians would be queuing up for US help!
2215 2018-01-03 19:35:58 I really want to go see The Book of Mormon someone please take me it's so funny and good. I nut to "I Believe" every time.
2216 2018-01-03 19:35:50 Worked, went to the bank, AND getting my oil changed today. Where’s my damn parade 
2217 2018-01-03 19:35:49 Yes, oil can go higher. But the key point: will oil at least fall back to where it is now? Yes. So from a bearish perspective, this is a good spot to short (not that I'd ever trade oil)
2218 2018-01-03 19:35:39 I didn't know that. I thought McDonald's fried their fries in canola or vegetable oil. I'm a little sad but not too much. I'll still eat them.
2219 2018-01-03 19:35:28 I don’t see a lot of unsustainable Oil rally these days now that we are at $60 but lots out when it was at $45
2220 2018-01-03 19:35:20 we don't pump our own gas in Oregon :)  Also.. yikes putting oil in a Tesla??!
2221 2018-01-03 19:35:20 For another sign of optimism, look only at the strength of commodities, led today by oil. Bloomberg's broad commodity index is enjoying its strongest rally in a year:
2222 2018-01-03 19:35:13 Black coffee with butter and MCT oil in it. It's blended together
2223 2018-01-03 19:34:59 @Scaramucci @realDonaldTrump It takes a special brand of delusion to really believe Trump is "doing a great job". But the snake oil salesman sold that brand to the voters too easily.
2224 2018-01-03 19:34:52 has anyone tried the tea tree oil and if you did is it good or
2225 2018-01-03 19:34:33 I would get one as soon as I settle. I am really tired of it. Coconut oil isn't doing my lips good
2226 2018-01-03 19:34:14 HAPPY NEW YEAR! New Oleum  Shipment in today just in time for Waxy Wednesday! 20% off all dabbable wax and oil in the store! <3 GreenWorks
2227 2018-01-03 19:34:13 if a pentest is a 12 point car inspection at an oil change shop, what we do is more like nsatao embedding tracking and surveillance devices in the car, backdooring the entertainment system, misreporting fuel consumption by hacking the canbus and showing what real badguys do.
2228 2018-01-03 19:34:10 Pretty sure US buys all their oil
2229 2018-01-03 19:34:06 I haven’t doubled cleansed yet but I do use the Beauty water prior to cleansing and I like it. What oil cleanser are you using? Yes I really like the “Snowflake Whipping Cleanser” it’s leaves my skin feeling so soft, clean and moisturized.
2230 2018-01-03 19:33:59 Is this what a well oil machine looks like? My 20yr old lawnmower runs and sounds better than the Trump administration.
2231 2018-01-03 19:33:55 Foes, then friends, then foes, then the enemy, then a friend, then a foe, then an enemy, then a threat, then a friend, now a target, OH! always a target, they got oil! Friends, enemies, foes, threats; how much does it cost this time?
2232 2018-01-03 19:33:49 y'all gotta stop ingesting coconut oil
2233 2018-01-03 19:33:45 Oh wow I DO. I saturated my hair with oil for the day and it still took me half an hour to get the knots out and now I can’t get the oil out and frankly if that brush can’t help me I might just do a Britney.
2234 2018-01-03 19:33:40 THIS IS HOW MILLENIALS SPEND THEIR 1 DAY OFF DURING 50+ HOUR WORK WEEKS

Oil change
Laundry
Home Depot run
Buy dog food
Hike/walk dogs/watch TV
Cook dinner/meal prep for week
Grocery shop
Coffee w/ a friend
More laundry

FUCK. YOUR. GOLF. @realDonaldTrump.

GIVE ME BACK MY MONEY.
2235 2018-01-03 19:33:37 In a global market that's favoring more efficient energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal, being the 'oil king' is kind of like getting a participation trophy. #accomplishmentzero
2236 2018-01-03 19:33:36 No matter how I season ang mo food it still tastes like paper. Rosemary, olive oil, lemon, garlic, white wine
2237 2018-01-03 19:33:33 Having a friend who jams out to musicals with you is fucking amazing.
2238 2018-01-03 19:33:21 Sir Ian Wood warned Salmond about the price of oil being volatile. He simply brushed this aside by saying Sir Ian was wrong.  Was he?  Was he f**k.

The SNP leaders misled the Scottish public at that time and they continue to mislead us, but more & more of us are waken up to it.
2239 2018-01-03 19:33:17 ...That moment when you accidentally get peppermint oil in your eyes when you’re driving  I’m not the only one...right? #Spooky
2240 2018-01-03 19:33:16 Again, I think he wants to take trump down from the inside... vying for the sec of state job to me was an act of trying to right the trump ship with someone who had a clue what to do, rather than an oil baron
2241 2018-01-03 19:33:08 YES that bubble gum lip scrub is amazing. I’m trying a lavender essential oil, but t doesn’t have much staying power, so I keep debating on Sleepy.

2243 2018-01-03 19:32:46 @MaddieDockery I made some kale chps today and for my seasoning I used some olive oil, pepper, and mrs. dash taco seasoning. They taste really good with the taco seasoning.
2244 2018-01-03 19:32:37 Are those full service places? Oil windshield etc. ?
2245 2018-01-03 19:32:34 IMHO CBD oil doesn't do zip.
2246 2018-01-03 19:32:33 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

2248 2018-01-03 19:32:21 Buy pre chopped red onion. Oil in pot, salt, sugar, pepper, paprika, balsamic. Fry for about 10 minutes constantly stirring, carmelised onion base for cooking, tear free
2249 2018-01-03 19:32:14 The US is no one's ally. America first, remember? What is it that is in it for you? Hmm. Oil??
2250 2018-01-03 19:32:11 Not that easy... how do you produce capital goods and oil locally? Please note you must remain competitive...
2251 2018-01-03 19:32:07 baby shampoo? She's used that to clean up elderly cats so knows safe but no idea effectiveness on oil.

2256 2018-01-03 19:31:29 I thought that is why we fought all the wars was to take all the oil from the Middle East?

I am so confused...

2259 2018-01-03 19:31:02 Yeah... but the issue is not imports per se... our biggest imports consist of oil and capital goods which are critical for production. The question is, where is the production?

2266 2018-01-03 19:30:16 Yupp! Just wash your face with a normal face wash of some sort and moisturize! Aloe Vera Gel is GREATT!! & No oils because that causes acne too! We don’t really need oil for our skin type.
2267 2018-01-03 19:30:10 Oil (Brent) is marking 67.905, surpassing the historic 12 month high of 67.345 by 0.832%
2268 2018-01-03 19:30:00 My point is that all I ever said was that coconut oil doesn't work for some people, it does for others, implying if you do chose to do that, make sure it's right for you!! It's really not that big of a deal lol I was just informing those who were about to put it on their face
2269 2018-01-03 19:29:59 I've used CBD oil and it is a godsend. Expensive, but legal and really helps
2270 2018-01-03 19:29:46 Also most petrol stations were full service garages. The attendant would also check your oil level and air in the tires. Extended to washer fluid as well in the later years. My da used to work at one when he was in his teens.

2272 2018-01-03 19:29:20 Most significant #NorthKorea news is that #DPRK is so desperate for food & oil that they are resorting to what has worked for them in the past to restock -- temporary or pseudo-but-perceived cooperation with #SouthKorea & international community.

2277 2018-01-03 19:28:42 If the world is moving away from oil, isn't it strange that oil consumption is at all time highs and growing every year?

Do you really believe that developing countries aren't going to use petroleum products to develop their industries and improve their living conditions?
2278 2018-01-03 19:28:32 I just changed the oil on @randamma car I fan girled so hard
2279 2018-01-03 19:28:18 Is that why the oil price is going up?
2280 2018-01-03 19:28:02 If drilling off shore in Florida would remove our counrty from depending on oil from other countries it would be worth it. Alaska does not pay taxes & the people earn money.

2287 2018-01-03 19:26:42 The oppression and dictatorship in Syria is worse than in Iran but Syria has the support of Putin who has as big a button as @POTUS and a bigger brain, oh I forgot Syria has no oil. Just one question what percentage of Americas GDP is weapon based?
2288 2018-01-03 19:26:39 And to make more $$$ For Big Oil they never care enough to not cut corners & there are always leaks!

2290 2018-01-03 19:26:06 Remember that Russia's economy is dangerously depended on the sale of oil and gas. The ambition to expand use of those things here is not a coincidence.

2299 2018-01-03 19:25:03 Both were/are awful. Hillary's pay for play business with the Saudis, war on the middle class like with the oil and coal industry workers,  and generally a nasty human being. 

We're still learning the awfulness that is Trump. I hope he gets primaried in 2020.
2300 2018-01-03 19:25:02 No, Donald. Bannon hasn’t lost his mind. It is you who are unhinged and drifting rudderless on a twitter sea. Face reality for a change and resign now. And folks, let’s help this snake oil salesman to the task. #voteindemsin2018
2301 2018-01-03 19:24:57 i’m all in my head while waiting for my car to get an oil change so let’s see if i start crying in the waiting room

2311 2018-01-03 19:23:24 Interesting that even Sir Ian Wood recently said there was lots of life left in the North Sea & far more Oil than he predicted in 2014. Which is a hell of a lot less that the Chairman of Oil & Gas said there was left at a conference in Edinburgh in 2012 or thereabouts! 
2312 2018-01-03 19:23:18 Oil boom, oil bust, manufacturing orders move with oil prices. It will be interesting to see when or if we ever hit new highs for the rig counts this decade
2313 2018-01-03 19:23:02 It’s very oil controlling, no flashback, long wearing, and really easy to blend out

2315 2018-01-03 19:22:49 I’m sure the Yamaha factory are burning the midnight oil to find a solution to their problems. Are they allowed to use their test riders or have to wait until the Sepang test with Rossi and Vinales?
2316 2018-01-03 19:22:28 Haha okay so one time i got my oil change w the synthetic blend and i felt so boujee haha why am i like this
2317 2018-01-03 19:22:28 It's time for sale. But, I don't know where oil would stop if it broke 62.50

2330 2018-01-03 19:21:25 Ridiculous. Why publish this ?
2331 2018-01-03 19:21:24 I have no doubt that oil companies have downplayed or actively suppressed the link between drawing energy from FF and contributing to climate change. I just think it's the wrong tactic to sue them because the responsibility for our predicament is shared.
2332 2018-01-03 19:21:21 I would call it the GOP - Bannon war. And Bannon has a severe list to starboard, one engine out, no steering control, steaming in circles, and trailing an oil slick as fuel slips away.
2333 2018-01-03 19:21:19 Rent paid, credit card paid, new tires ordered, oil change and tune up done and I’m not broke! 2018 is off to a great start... thank God!

2335 2018-01-03 19:21:14 By my eye the Oil have run 3 different PK strategies in the last 2 month's. Forgive my lack if knowledge on the proper names, but they had a collapse, some weird i formation, and now a passive box with more pressure. 0 for 3.
2336 2018-01-03 19:21:05 Every time I get sick, I am always reminded to take my daily intake of apple cider vinegar, spirulina and coconut oil

2340 2018-01-03 19:20:47 I've recently taken up oil painting. If I've learned anything from it so far it's that digital painting really doesn't teach you to appreciate the process of painting. Mixing paint and prepping materials takes more time than actually marking the canvas.
2341 2018-01-03 19:20:46 pretty smart how they park halfway up the snow pile to mask the oil leaks

He's learned 2 do some brailler repair & I think is actually certified, from what I remember, but he says it's getting harder 2 find the parts. Just for oil though, I've been meaning to ask him about that.
2346 2018-01-03 19:20:23 I hope Rachel explains 2 viewers how Arctic amplification of global warming has altered the circumpolar jet stream, cause far worse is yet to come, & with Russians controlling DC, government won't speak of it. At least not while there is still one penny to be made in oil.
2347 2018-01-03 19:20:12 It's kind of crazy that the the more that they realise that the majority don't want independence, the more rabid they get about it. If Indy had happened, the excuse for the lack of economic growth and the oil crash would have been laid at Westminsters' feet.

I'd better go take more evening primrose oil.

2358 2018-01-03 19:19:06 In 50 years' time, people in Scotland (if it still exists) will look back in bafflement that a country awash with renewable energy ever worried about the price of oil.

2361 2018-01-03 19:18:58 You need to get your head out of the denial websites and honestly research funding. Oil infrastructure also receives subsidies and tax breaks. Renewable infrastructure, once set up is vastly cheaper and needs no subsidies. The opposite actually
2362 2018-01-03 19:18:50 When you surround yourself with oil slicks, this is what happens. Bannon goes to war with Trump -- and now vice versa. Cable news nets go wild again, squeezing out every last bit of juice & then re-squeezing. And we've only just begun.

2381 2018-01-03 19:17:21 Hey Andrew who will pay for the oil sands clean up costs? Corporations? NO than who will pay for it? Say with me “Albertans will pay for oil sands clean up”. How much it will be $40Billion for next 30years.
2382 2018-01-03 19:17:18 Maybe he's out? How much credibility can they have going forward?

2387 2018-01-03 19:17:06 @SullyCNBC  Danielle Booth excellent guest. Helena Croft too. Ron Insana is worthless. Just anti Trump talk.  Like oil over $60 thanks to following Helena bull call. Big gains!!!
2388 2018-01-03 19:17:04 Yay! Next up: offshore oil riggers. Enough of all those pesky safety standards. Deepwater Horizon 2.0
2389 2018-01-03 19:17:03 Cholesterol free refined oil disi. 
2390 2018-01-03 19:16:50 Had a yeast infection and 1 Monistat inactive ingredient was hydrogenated veg oil. That's almost always soy which is one of my (many) allergies. Neither Dr nor pharma could tell me if safe! THIS IS GOING IN MY VAGINA Y'ALL!!!
2391 2018-01-03 19:16:43 Then it's time to look at seed oils as well. My own liibre shows me . Potatoes boiled    jump in  blood sugar but copable   potatoes fried  on seed oil  big jump .  What has happened to proportion of seed oil in diet whilst obesity has been increasing ?
2392 2018-01-03 19:16:40 Beautiful  Alaska?? Not when you're finished destroying it!
Sellout to archaic oil energy instead of having the brains to preserve the environment with renewables. SHAME ON YOU.
2393 2018-01-03 19:16:24 Argon Oil, Tea Tree Oil, Dëva Curls, Coconut Shampoo, I can send you a picture of what I use
2394 2018-01-03 19:16:24 If anyone suffers with asthma or a bad chest honestly an oil diffuser is the shit you need in your life
2395 2018-01-03 19:16:17 I like Gov Cuomo's environmental ideas, but he should not be so quick to dismiss oil, petrochemicals, and gas driven machinary. All areas of energy should be explored and used.
2396 2018-01-03 19:16:16 I never eat processed food (or oil) fresh is best! Keep up the good work!!
2397 2018-01-03 19:16:03 Russia is supplying NKorea with oil, and now NKorea's opened communication with SKorea. Something is going on.
2398 2018-01-03 19:16:01 Talking about your obsession of an imminent oil pullback since WTI was at 52$  not your trading ...I ‘m sure you’re doing just fine 
2399 2018-01-03 19:15:55 What does "Giant of Africa" and "Are we not meant to be moving forward?" have to do with fixing PMS prices? You mean better refineries? PMS is a derivative of Crude oil. If the price of crude oil goes up, PMS should go up. It's happening with Diesel. Why should PMS be different?
2400 2018-01-03 19:15:42 He made a ton of money peddling that snake oil
2401 2018-01-03 19:15:40 You miss the point by ignoring the underlying causes of venezela’s economy problems. What if your country was embargoed by the largest military and economic power because you wouldnt let them come and take your oil. Entirely consistent with usa regime change history look it up.
2402 2018-01-03 19:15:39 If someone sets up a Go Fund Me page they'd probably get enough to pay for heating oil, more livestock feed for the rest of the winter and maybe a little extra cushion.  Happy to pitch in a little if there is info where to send funds.
2403 2018-01-03 19:15:29 I will have more confidence in economic recovery in 2019 once Ndp are gone. The ndp will not use additional monies from oil to pay off debts or to entice energy sector recovery.They will just spend spend spend. No fiscal responsibility until after election.
2404 2018-01-03 19:15:26 He has started sharing Rice n groundnut oil again?

2422 2018-01-03 19:13:33 Like removing regulations that protect seniors in nursing homes, or those that protect our environment & our health. Selling our Land to Oil Companies, removing fracking regs which will cause earthquakes, see OK, there are more coal deaths in 2018 from removing safety regs.
2423 2018-01-03 19:13:30 James: are you being weird, dear? 
Me: noooooooo
@jamesnouch: because it seems like you just called the asparagus your sweet children and told them to coat themselves in oil, is that normal?

I feel so judged :'(
2424 2018-01-03 19:13:28 i posted it. Why dont you show me the new cheerlead you've been working on for global oil dressed as patriotism
2425 2018-01-03 19:13:26 Pumping your own gas will not lower prices, it will only reduce the number of jobs. The only reason to push this through is to benefit the oil companies.
2426 2018-01-03 19:13:19 i’m at the point with the service guy at the car dealership bc i spend half my life there that he called and said he had bad news and then pulled a “jk your car is fine and we’re done changing the oil” OK GREG WAY TO GIVE ME A HEART ATTACK.
2427 2018-01-03 19:13:17 Oil diffusers are everything.
2428 2018-01-03 19:13:12 Chef Gusteau cut up some carrots, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was chicken, along with toothpaste.

2431 2018-01-03 19:13:10 @jiffylube can you explain to me how even a synthetic oil change can cost 90 dollars? The gentlemen here hooked me up with 20% off. But still come on guys. That’s absolutely ridiculous.

2437 2018-01-03 19:12:21 I listen to the scientists (not the 3% of ones on oil companies' payrolls). Same with doctor when I'm sick.
2438 2018-01-03 19:12:21 Real purpose of these ppl in public life seems to be selling books and speaking anymore.  Day jobs just means to this end.
2439 2018-01-03 19:12:20 Trump is a phony cock sucker, he wants Iran destroyed even after a regime change. They don't care about Iran. They care about oil and their own national interest in the middle East once the regime is gone
2440 2018-01-03 19:12:19 His logic is: I want to get rich. Oil seems like a good way to do that. You have facts that suggest looking for oil is bad. This interferes with my primary objective therefore your facts must be wrong.
2441 2018-01-03 19:12:18 With the oil slump here, lots of houses for sale. And now new mortgage rules.

2443 2018-01-03 19:12:04 #Coal and #nuclear plants in the northeast and mid-Atlantic will have huge net revenues with the cold spell. Their costs are largely independent of weather, and very high wholesale market prices due to high gas and oil prices will directly benefit them.
2444 2018-01-03 19:11:52 The oil that has the anthropic climate change consequence? Yeah that oil.

2450 2018-01-03 19:11:26 @OxmoorFLM Your service department is a joke!  I had an oil change appointment at 12:30...as of 2:10, I'm still here and they haven't even pulled my vehicle in!  I will never do any sort of business with you again

2455 2018-01-03 19:11:17 And I gotta get an oil change & a car wash
2456 2018-01-03 19:11:03 Truly pathetic you're pretending to be "Apache" and using this canard of an appointment for political gain. What about Andrew Jackson & the Indian Removal Act? Trump sells off Bears Ears for oil gutting? Sherman enslaving the Plains Indians? The situation NOW at Pine Ridge?
2457 2018-01-03 19:10:58 @TheRealTriscuit Kudos to your innovation team - the new flavors are smart & flavorful. Smoked Gouda! Rosemary & Olive Oil! Keep it up!

2461 2018-01-03 19:10:27 I'm now wondering if people failing on high fat low carb were having too much coconut oil. I.e. coconut oil doesn't seem to be as effective. Keep reading about stalls with coconut oil.
2462 2018-01-03 19:10:21 So no matter how enthusiastically you shake your pom poms in cheer leading oil, it is not the only game in town, and alternative industry is not a communist plot, its a capitalist reality

5. get battery-operated racket to electrocute those effers

2471 2018-01-03 19:09:39 [takes a deep breath] It catches the light in pictures. All models wear it if they aren’t using oil or something.
2472 2018-01-03 19:09:38 How soon are you running out of oil?
2473 2018-01-03 19:09:35 Saying that 30% perf loss is no big deal with #intelbug because home PCs don’t use all the CPU is like saying 30% oil price hike is OK because there is enough oil in the ground
2474 2018-01-03 19:09:29 I guess I reallyyyy pissed her off 3 years ago if I sit across from her while we both are getting our oil changed ... and we sit in awkward silence for 30 minutes...

2482 2018-01-03 19:08:57 BTW, I said nothing about OPEC, but as a side note Petro dollars are in U.S. dollars. 

The U.S. has significant influence in oil pricing. It's why we have the worlds largest police force stationed all around the globe.
2483 2018-01-03 19:08:55 Getting my car oil changed and working on my laptop in the waiting area with my laptop on my lap. Why y'all gotta sit right in my leg space?
2484 2018-01-03 19:08:53 The best thing I could ever do for my hair is putting coconut oil all over my hair before washing it! It helps it stay so moisturized in the winter

2491 2018-01-03 19:07:45 He states it's about the Olympics but more likely about keeping some illegal oil flowing in.
2492 2018-01-03 19:07:33 わーい！おやすみなさい！
2493 2018-01-03 19:07:27 Recall that Trump, the self-proclaimed know-it-all with the [nuclear] "bigger button," is the same imbecile who asked in 2016, "Can't we just take the oil?" forcibly from Iraq. Stupid is as stupid does...only now with nukes.
2494 2018-01-03 19:07:26 So if Mexico doesn't pony up for the wall (as promised by #trump), our Guvmnt is gonna shut down. This is better than all the flowers and candy that the locals greeted our soldiers with in Iraq. Oh and all the oil profits that paid us back for the war!
2495 2018-01-03 19:07:23 When did I strike out with rage? I'm over here striking out with compassion  he will never fight for you. These rich dudes call poor white people 'trash'. And if we have so much oil and fossil fuels why TF did we spend 25+ years in the Middle East terrorizing their people?
2496 2018-01-03 19:07:19 Driving is more expensive than flying. Wuuu oil, water, tyres, toll gates, car wash, petrol. Wuuu never again 
2497 2018-01-03 19:07:04 Just got in my car about to get oil changed 
2498 2018-01-03 19:06:56 I'm pretty basic.  I salt and pepper, and then sear the roast in some olive oil using the saute setting. 

I'd recommend cutting the roast in half though, a full roast is hard to turn in the instant pot. Especially if it sticks a bit to the bottom, which it should.
2499 2018-01-03 19:06:54 I just want my apartment to look like a jungle and smell like one of those essential oil chain stores in the mall

2513 2018-01-03 19:05:27 As with the relationship between studios and movie theaters, oil companies do not let gas stations keep the bulk of their earnings; just enough to keep alive  :(  This is why most service stations are total sleeze pits.
2514 2018-01-03 19:05:21 Ironic though considering the amount of oil they produce

2516 2018-01-03 19:05:16 we run mile long coal and oil trains
2517 2018-01-03 19:05:14 RT @LivingSafely: Eating Propyl Alcohol this January? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.
2518 2018-01-03 19:05:13 Fed Fomc minutes show hawkish tone from officials. January rate hike? Commodities including crude oil and gold fall
2519 2018-01-03 19:05:07 Be there in 2 baby bring the oil 
2520 2018-01-03 19:05:05 I always have soy sauce and I have sesame oil. It's literally the only ingredient I'm missing!! Getting it tomorrow for sure 
2521 2018-01-03 19:05:04 Sadly, he is parading them to Normandy. Maybe he should spend more time on X's and O's. Lucas Oil and Pasadena are good starts....
2522 2018-01-03 19:05:03 But 'our' oil is in their ground...that's all that matters!
2523 2018-01-03 19:05:03 I also had that thought. Although I like and agree with most of what is there, I don't trust it. Let's not get overly excited just yet. Remember Bannon is also a snake oil salesman
2524 2018-01-03 19:05:03 cost of production in the Oil sands is higher than most other oil fields.
2525 2018-01-03 19:04:57 Don’t be so foolish. He will rape your country for oil in exchange for his tweets of support. He will dangle help in exchange for $$$. He NEVER has in history done something because it’s the right thing to do.
2526 2018-01-03 19:04:55 If he goes to jail, Paulie has a wonderful system for doing the garlic. He uses a razor and slices it so thin that it liquefies in the pan with just a little oil. Its a very good system."
2527 2018-01-03 19:04:55 Left my tea tree oil at my aunt house 
2528 2018-01-03 19:04:48 Which brings my skepticism in from the other direction: if canola oil had such potent effects, it seems like it would be easily detectable in humans.
2529 2018-01-03 19:04:34 Car fixed, oil change, nails done, money in the bank, hella food at my house, New clothes and shoes. 2018 YOU ARE ALREADY DOING ME GOOD.
2530 2018-01-03 19:04:32 Tax breaks cause this .... whole Norway makes its money selling oil
2531 2018-01-03 19:04:22 Work till 7-12, then getting an oil change & carwash, gym, shower, and lastly nap. 

Decently productive day
2532 2018-01-03 19:04:20 Post Brexit UK,free of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, will move to world food prices expect UK food prices to reduce by 16%. World oil prices are fixed in USD no change here on Brexit.
2533 2018-01-03 19:04:18 Oil is very toxic. DON'T put anything on fur to get her to wash.  
Use warm washing up liquid & gently rub fur. Rinse WELL & repeat if necessary.  Baby wipes won't clean engine oil.  Good luck 
2534 2018-01-03 19:04:14 For the fact that fuel prices are that high in those countries doesn't mean it should be the same in Nigeria. Why is Nigeria once referred to giant of Africa then? Mostly because of the oil... Are we not meant to be moving forward?
2535 2018-01-03 19:04:05 It is fancier than just putting oil on it
2536 2018-01-03 19:03:59 There's a lot of porn out there that would disagree with this mofo...REAL men can handle a plus-size woman, and they make sure to have plenty of baby oil ready!
2537 2018-01-03 19:03:43 I have. There's a ton of research out there. Obviously lobbyists for gas/oil companies feed you lies you're gullible enough to believe. SA is not in an earthquake zone, since they started fracking in Botswana(neighbouring country), Gauteng, KZN etc have experienced tremours.
2538 2018-01-03 19:03:35 Getting close to starting an $OIL short as its now meeting all my criteria for a solid mean reversion play. $Copper short is paying out, and I'm still holding #natgas long.Its been making higher lows on the 4 hr chart since the Dec 29th and looks to be coiling for a run to 3.08
2539 2018-01-03 19:03:34 ACV, Jojoba oil, aloe Vera, turmeric (the organic ones), manuka honey, African black soap (organic or chemical free ones), shea butter 
2540 2018-01-03 19:03:05 Jojoba oil and making sure to drink plenty of water
2541 2018-01-03 19:02:41 Getting your oil changed at jiffy lube is almost as bad as sitting at the DMV
2542 2018-01-03 19:02:38 2Hrs until US close

2543 2018-01-03 19:02:05 Of course it affects any business/country/individual but Venezuela has been able to sort deep depressions in the oil prices before
2544 2018-01-03 19:01:50 Full service is clean windshield, fill w/s wiper fluid if needed, check oil and pump gas, not just pump gas.
2545 2018-01-03 19:01:29 Hope you warm up!  Thanks for the encouragement, genuinely appreciated xx

2555 2018-01-03 19:00:38 A comb would be better, because it will slowly detangle those curls. To make it a little smoother, try applying some Beard Oil or Utility Balm first.

2556 2018-01-03 19:00:34 OIL DIFF: 6.5 -> 6.54
2557 2018-01-03 19:00:27 how about Oil Bros or Comm Bros or Government Bros.. so many Bros, so little time.
2558 2018-01-03 19:00:24 No sorry. Offshore is considered federal as you get licenses from the federal government not state. California produces much more oil than LA. In fact they are number 3!

2561 2018-01-03 19:00:21 Today I went for an oil change, I forgot my coffee in the car and the fire alarm went off
2562 2018-01-03 19:00:10 Gotta oil that pan, goy'l! I'll help you if you want back in Boca. My nibblings call me the pancake master for a reason. :)
2563 2018-01-03 19:00:04 Join @albertareporter to chat about 60-dollar #oil and what it means for #alberta - just after the noon news on @albertaatnoon
2564 2018-01-03 19:00:00 Hi @WiltonCakes please consider not using palm oil in your fondant. Palm oil kills wildlife and destroys forests. You’re a better company than that.
2565 2018-01-03 18:59:52 You should never put olive oil on anything unless you're going to eat it.
2566 2018-01-03 18:59:51 Bromance.

2568 2018-01-03 18:59:41 It's only mildly warm, but that could be either me (I love spicy) or the capsicum oil degrading a tiny bit.
2569 2018-01-03 18:59:28 you are arguing that a multiple bankruptcy snake oil salesman and failed casino owner throwing tantrums on social media granted us life.
2570 2018-01-03 18:59:06 Warum überhaupt die Nachrichtenverschlüsselung? Damit man sagen kann, die Nachricht ist niemals unverschlüsselt. Aber der Schlüssel liegt halt daneben. Snake oil. #beA
2571 2018-01-03 18:58:57 Yes, pretty close anyway :)

IMO it’s one thing for pre-science humans to create myths to explain their world. It’s a whole different thing to sell snake oil stories like this well after the Age of Enlightenment and the establishment of science.
2572 2018-01-03 18:58:43 Yes it was. Before 2005, the last time oil prices peaked was 1980. Oil price took hits of 50% or more without a single day of shortage of gas or anything.
2573 2018-01-03 18:58:38 You’re in luck, 2 pairs of socks gets you around 30 mins on the table. Courtesy of my dad. We’ll supply the oil!
2574 2018-01-03 18:58:05 Saudia which is the biggest supplier of oil even they have the price of oil by 50%. So how can we have cheaper rates. But govt shouldn't increase by Rs 4.

2579 2018-01-03 18:57:55 Has anyone tried Hollywood beauty tea tree oil?
2580 2018-01-03 18:57:47 I followed the Science-based Medicine blog for several years. They started like this, but were even then far down the slippery slope.

Even when I pointed out that, for instance there were good scientific reasons and studies supporting coconut oil for Alzheimer's...
2581 2018-01-03 18:57:47 they were literally reg fries drenched in oil w/ garlic lol
2582 2018-01-03 18:57:45 Strong workplace protections for whistleblowers and in health and safety (MSHA expanded to oil, both MSHA and OSHA work with industry rather than enforce only for budget), organized labor, etc.
2583 2018-01-03 18:57:44 Damn import oil..
2584 2018-01-03 18:57:36 Unfortunately gas and oil prices are proportional to the level of conflict on the Middle East... so that is a good incentive for Countries that depend heavily on oil and gas to keep the conflict going... I am sure I am not the first one to think this.
2585 2018-01-03 18:57:29 Tea tree oil helps with that pure tea tree oil
2586 2018-01-03 18:57:28 Hello second trimester  also hello to back pain, headaches, and coconut oil

2589 2018-01-03 18:57:02 Gov Cuomo if you’re not afraid to tackle tough problems pls stand up to Big Oil and stop expanding gas infrastructure for the #StateOfOurKids @JeffPlatsky @bnearing10

2593 2018-01-03 18:56:28 My sister: just because I’m a girl doesn’t mean I can’t do it! 
*mentions her car needs an oil change* 
my sister: what I’m a girl I can’t do that. 
SO GUESS WHO HAS TO GO DO IT AND IS WAITING 45-60 MINUTES WHILE SHE TOOK MY CAR.
2594 2018-01-03 18:56:26 Yay  we're supposed to be getting snow all day tomorrow. At least we just put more oil in the tank 
2595 2018-01-03 18:56:23 The dealership I got my 'fuckit bucket' from just sent me a free oil change coupon for my birthday! 

Now THAT'S what I call music!
2596 2018-01-03 18:56:16 Now you can overturn the crazy protection for "supplement" snake oil.  Prevagan, for example is unbelievably shameless.
2597 2018-01-03 18:56:10 will saudi stop oil to usa if it happen america will be zero econamy
2598 2018-01-03 18:56:04 Hell I'm so old I remember when an attendent pumped gas for you and even cleaned windshield and checked oil to !!

2602 2018-01-03 18:55:27 Coconut oil?
2603 2018-01-03 18:55:27 gold is , but miners not so much. 14 of 22 miners tracked are below what I consider is stay long levels. Only 36% are still active long on price.  Whereas oil stocks I have only 2 of 33 below the stay long level it 94% still active. Miners internals are bleeding
2604 2018-01-03 18:55:17 will saudi stop oil trad

2614 2018-01-03 18:53:59 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.

2619 2018-01-03 18:53:41 My statement was a tip that I've learned, and following that tip was me saying it works for some people. Your statement was that I'm telling people to not use oil on their skin which is the furthest statement from true. I understand racial tension is at an all/time high,
2620 2018-01-03 18:53:41 It's a good look!
2621 2018-01-03 18:53:31 Who devalued their currency on IMF prescriptions and removed subsidies on gas and electric yet sells pump price lower than Nigeria or Algeria, Iran other high oil producers like us whose pump prices are still lower than Nigeria. Don't confuse yourself/5
2622 2018-01-03 18:53:25 There is no "peak oil." Now there is only peak oil demand.

2635 2018-01-03 18:52:14 This is like covering your body in coconut oil thinking it will solve all your problems, but maybe I should start doing it
2636 2018-01-03 18:51:58 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.

2657 2018-01-03 18:49:22 Ill be that superstitious type and say if the Oil make the playoffs he'll never change it again. #ButWeWillSee
2658 2018-01-03 18:49:11 Iran is willing to forego the U.S. dollar and accept Chinese Yuan for its oil. China can use this to force Saudi Arabia and other  countries to do the same, This is a nightmare situation for petrodollar, Wall Street, and the US government.
2659 2018-01-03 18:49:08 Like I miss smoking actual bud butttt I don’t... this oil cartridge shit is so clutch

2661 2018-01-03 18:48:59 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
2662 2018-01-03 18:48:57 i wanna know how russia's oil output is now jumping when it was waning not that long ago
2663 2018-01-03 18:48:55 yup could've had Faulk, and maybe Skinner for Taylor Hall...Yes Hall is worth that much!! Jersy ripped the Oil off big time!
2664 2018-01-03 18:48:49 We have oil. ...few years ago we had a bad blizzard it was right before vday,had no power for 3 days freezing wore every warm thing I had

2666 2018-01-03 18:48:28 I got oil on my uggs 
2667 2018-01-03 18:48:27 Only time I did not pump my gas was either getting gas in New Jersey, or paying the extra 10¢ a gallon for full service, so the guy would check my oil, add windshield washer fluid, and fill the tank, while I went inside to pee.
2668 2018-01-03 18:47:26 They toppled the prime minister and broght the Shah back from exile, CIA and British intelligence. Had to do with oil.
2669 2018-01-03 18:47:25 With a large, well-educated middle class population and massive reserves of oil/gas, Iran has the potential to become a powerful economy and a  dominant nation, if given a chance.

2675 2018-01-03 18:46:56 Ok that sounds good but what part of that is socialist. The socialist leader tore up contracts with oil and gas companies sure, but that isn’t socialism, that’s closer to a dictatorship. Molyneux labeling this as the failure of socialism is US-60s era fear mongering.
2676 2018-01-03 18:46:47 Let’s see if this baby oil for a week does the job

2678 2018-01-03 18:46:43 Nuts are my biggest source of fat. Walnuts are a good choice as they're highest in omega-3s. Macadamia are the best source of monounsaturated fats, like those in olive oil.
2679 2018-01-03 18:46:38 You wey talk say Nigeria will stop oil import next year
2680 2018-01-03 18:46:35 U know how we do .. or baby oil and a belt.   The lying cheat
2681 2018-01-03 18:46:34 Trump is the face of global oil money. Once this is understood, everything becomes clear What he wants to destroy and the industrial status quo he wants to maintain be defanging political power by confusing and dividing. His patriotism is the sugar, and globalist oil's the poison
2682 2018-01-03 18:46:33 I've been on a real Brussel sprouts kick lately, and I love it

Get yoself some sprouts, cut em' in half, drizzle some oil and chopped garlic on those mofo's 

Bake on a baking sheet at 425 for ~20 min

You got yourself some delicious sprouts
2683 2018-01-03 18:46:29 Huge deficits and massive corruption (see arrested Saudi princes) and a future looking bleak for oil sales due to Shale oil producers in the US and coming of electric cars. It has decided to plug the hole in its deficit public finance and thus jacked up pump prices to 0.54cents/2
2684 2018-01-03 18:46:22 TMW you read “oil caddy” as “oil daddy.” So close but so different #oildaddy #need
2685 2018-01-03 18:46:09 @FBIWFO AT Metro K MARKET the slippery female & Hispanic male screwed me over on the contaminated oil& soy sauce. I don't LIKE DISHONEST BUSINESS. SELLING CONTAMINATED FOOD.
2686 2018-01-03 18:45:56 Watching C-Span 2. Senator Bill Nelson is speaking truth to power. Oil spills are catastrophic. We have to help the new Puerto Rico ppl in Fl to register to vote. This Republican Congress will not be there for any of us. No more oil spills!
2687 2018-01-03 18:45:48 Pamper day • nails, coconut oil hair mask, face masks, & a long hot bath with my favourite bath bomb 
2688 2018-01-03 18:45:15 Wonder where "Al Gore" is? Probably burning lot's of gas and oil keeping all his homes warm....
2689 2018-01-03 18:45:15 Yes and Gasoline is derived from oil.
2690 2018-01-03 18:45:14 Ingredient Watch: Eating Propyl Alcohol this January? Used as a synthetic flavoring, it's made from natural gas and fusel oil.
2691 2018-01-03 18:45:12 There are numerous reasons why Iran is geopolitically pivotal. To start with, Iran has the 4th largest oil reserves in the world and also shares the largest natural gas reserves with Qatar.
2692 2018-01-03 18:45:05 One oil change spot told me “my car can’t get the $29.99 treatment?” I said why cause it’s white? So you racist buddy.
2693 2018-01-03 18:45:05 Thank you
2694 2018-01-03 18:45:04 yet how much will it rise due to gas prices going up due to the increase in oil prices ?
2695 2018-01-03 18:44:42 @CanadianFuels You guys are an utter disgrace to every motorist in Canada, we have a global glut on cheap crude oil yet you continue to hike the price at the pump, this is nothing short of corporate THEFT, how you you feel if Tim Hortons did the same with coffee?? #theft
2696 2018-01-03 18:44:37 Yes, at the appropiate time for going to get that oil for a cheap price.

2700 2018-01-03 18:44:31 I love tea tree oil for my skin, heals so many skin conditions and abrasions
2701 2018-01-03 18:44:14 Jeez. It’s almost like these two idiots were made for each other. I can see them having secret Grecian getaways, lathering each other in olive oil and rolling around on the beach...not that there’s anything wrong with that.
2702 2018-01-03 18:44:03 Where can i get a vape pen/oil 
2703 2018-01-03 18:44:03 Have said this time w/o number, failire of security agencies to unravel & unmask perpetrators is the oil that feeds these cycle if killings. Most criminals will perpetrate the dastard acts & get away wt it under the guise of Herdsmen.
2704 2018-01-03 18:44:02 Followed all MAGA patriots
2705 2018-01-03 18:43:59 Now talking about Saudi, their FX Exchange rate is 3.75 SAR/$1 and it's been so since 1986. The govt had been giving it's citizens cheap gasoline considering they are the world's largest crude oil producer and refine all their needs locally. With a dent in their public finances/1
2706 2018-01-03 18:43:57 We didn't steal Iraq's oil they get all the profits from that resource.

We did guard the oil wells in Iraq and secure them for free for many years while helping revuild the country and train Iraqi to defend their oil.
2707 2018-01-03 18:43:47 Where are the 29.99 oil change spots?
2708 2018-01-03 18:43:47 To hell with your aid, we don't need any. It's US who attacked countries in the name of terrorism, rob all their wealth (gold, oil everything) & then keep giving little help to the ppl whose wealth they have looted.

2712 2018-01-03 18:43:14 I feel bad for that model that he has to do squat while has oil all over his body.

2714 2018-01-03 18:43:13 Check your Transmission oil this weekend.
2715 2018-01-03 18:43:03 It's not down to government to control the cost/supply of oil when theres no emergency! It's market forces, the government will however promote clean fuel options such as wind,solar and wave power which are growing in use.Don't blame Obama for looking at clean alternatives v oil!
2716 2018-01-03 18:42:44 me, a tuscanian from tuscany, preparing a dish: meh, if things go wrong i'll just drown it in olive oil
2717 2018-01-03 18:42:15 The leak wasn't the only issue I was talking about. The fact that it was built through protected lands, the oil won't even be used by us but exported so we don't get lower gas/oil prices, etc. are also a problem
2718 2018-01-03 18:42:05 Love how oil is fucked and $SDRL chart is destroyed and they filed bankruptcy but chatroom say next big thing heading to 0.40. I’ll lose to weed but not this god forbid.
2719 2018-01-03 18:42:04 #HealthyOil = Avocado oil -  great for frying.
2720 2018-01-03 18:42:01 If oil goes up $20-25, PMI data is much stronger and core CPI and PCE inflation is well above 2% ... Maybe... But... I will take the other side of this call
2721 2018-01-03 18:41:54 Rice, but no junk inflammatory vegetable oils with it,  olive oil the best if you use oil, or fresh red palm oil or coconut oil in moderation, best organic brown rice that you can get at grocery store for good price…fries have glycation molecules that are highly carcinogenic…
2722 2018-01-03 18:41:53 there are no sanctions placed against Venezuela, also the "oil prices were manipulated" is nice scapegoat if you dont think about the fact that oil prices are controled by OPEC, which Venezuela is a member of.
2723 2018-01-03 18:41:51 Better to buy donuts that don’t destroy the world by using Palm Oil.   These ones are free of palm oils.

2725 2018-01-03 18:41:38 Fantastic oil paint
2726 2018-01-03 18:41:21 I respectfully disagree. CBD oil has changed my life. Can’t wait for UT to add THC. 49 yrs old, 14 major ortho surgeries and vicious cycles of MAOI’s and pain management to function. CBD has balanced me neurologically and I have eliminated 5 meds in 4 months.
2727 2018-01-03 18:41:15 I like to fry them in oil, it makes them taste just like a funnel cake. So bad for you, but they're so so good! 
2728 2018-01-03 18:41:15 We tune up our cars - oil changes, etc - but we don't tune up our relationships like we should, says Joanne Ayala Mylacrane - consultant for the Marriage & Family Institute in #SanAntonio
2729 2018-01-03 18:41:10 Sounds & looks great! My fav for cauliflower is roast w/ olive oil & pepper -- and just near the end lots of za-atar w/ sumac. Once out of oven, micro-plane w/ Parmesan aka flavored salt ;)

2740 2018-01-03 18:39:53 Do u ever just make up scenarios in ur mind? I’m waiting for my oil to get changed & this guy came & sat down next to me. We both sat in silence for like 30min until he got up to go to the bathroom & when he came back he didn’t sit by me anymore. Is he mad @ me?Are we in a fight?
2741 2018-01-03 18:39:46 @Shell_Canada So I see that although we still have a global glut on cheap crude oil, you still find a way to hike the price up and gouge the users at the pumps, this is THEFT on a massive scale you should be ashamed of yourselves, don't treat us as fools

2758 2018-01-03 18:37:15 But the irony of increasing crude price to such country like Nigeria is that the landing cost of refined fuel will also go up, hence, likelihood of going back to subsidy. I feel it's high time our leaders divert some of the excess crude oil revenue into Constructing new refinery

2763 2018-01-03 18:36:23 Your reply was awkward and silly since it came under the last part of my tweet and wasn't addressing that tweet. Earning enough or little FX is not the issue, how we run our MONETARY SYSTEM is. Hence, whenever Nigeria earns more FX from oil sales it never reflects in its/1

2793 2018-01-03 18:33:31 He does nothing of the sort rather he deals with entire resource extraction industry which has been under fire as anyone looking at mine applications would tell you. Certainly uses oil sands as an example but clearly discussing entire gamut of resource industries

2800 2018-01-03 18:32:37 Good for long distance rowers, though; possibly no oil available due To Scottish intransigence and no money to pay the Middle East cartel!
2801 2018-01-03 18:32:36 #FunFact: Canola oil is made from the rape seed. It gets the Can in its name from Canada, where it comes from. 

Also, they gave it that name because as marketing opportunities go, calling it rape oil is arguably ill-advised.
2802 2018-01-03 18:32:34 these oil stocks have me on the edge
2803 2018-01-03 18:32:33 I love coming to get the oil changed on my car. Always a fun Wednesday when you're spoken to in condescending and patronizing tones.
2804 2018-01-03 18:32:22 Followed the few I didn't have!
2805 2018-01-03 18:32:20 Well, I’m sorry you feel that way but it’s a valid opinion. The oil lamp railway has gone. And if you read my analogy with airline cabin crew it’s obv safety certification and training is implied.
2806 2018-01-03 18:32:08 Got a whole bottle of Jamaican black castor oil in my handbag ..for this harmattan...lmao
2807 2018-01-03 18:32:03 Just make sure to not cut off the oil rich ones or the ones where we can sell arms or rebuild...
2808 2018-01-03 18:31:46 ومين قالك اني زعلانه 
2809 2018-01-03 18:31:42 Oil?
2810 2018-01-03 18:31:28 Baby powder works too. Or coconut oil. Or literally anything that has a nice odor.
2811 2018-01-03 18:31:24 Ok maybe it is time for me to drink that one oil 
2812 2018-01-03 18:31:21 My next girl gotta know how to work on cars period. Oil change, change tires, rebuild transmissions the whole 9

2815 2018-01-03 18:31:10 Idk all the ppl who said they take it with oil are west Libyans is it a west Libya thing or smth
2816 2018-01-03 18:31:02 Everyone is running out of heating oil as well. Boston oil terminals are closing one by one. No product. I guess the ships are on their way here from somewhere but delayed for obvious reasons. I see a big baby boom come next Aug/Sept. 
2817 2018-01-03 18:30:54 Yikes. We've just run out of oil and the internet's down. 
2818 2018-01-03 18:30:48 OIL DIFF: 6.52 -> 6.53
2819 2018-01-03 18:30:48 I read both tweets. Your question was silly so I ignored it and responded to the first tweet. ICYMI the point I was making, a good monetary system whilst desirable will not change the fact that we do not earn enough FX from oil for it to make the kind of impact you referred to.
2820 2018-01-03 18:30:44 That's partly because Norway was prudent with its oil revenue, while Britain pissed it up the wall.

2822 2018-01-03 18:30:25 youtubers are exactly like regular tubers, best kept buried in dirt then put in boiling oil. The same
2823 2018-01-03 18:30:19 Venezuela was able to sort many depressions in the price of oil without any disruption in its (imperfect) democracy (1958-1999)

2830 2018-01-03 18:29:41 Brussels Sprouts and Gammon Carbonara. Slice the sprouts and fry in olive oil with the gammon (cut into small pieces) to caramelise. Cook and drain the pasta (i use linguine), mix in the gammon and sprouts adding some hot condensed mushroom soup and seasoning. Truly delish.

2833 2018-01-03 18:29:11 cube potatoes and put them in a plastic bag with olive oil, minced garlic, salt, pepper, italian seasoning. shake the bag to coat the potatoes, then pour them into a tray and bake at 375 for an hour
2834 2018-01-03 18:29:05 1.Why am I seeing this?
2. You must have done something bad to be this scared of @AGSchneiderman 
3. Fuck big oil companies
2835 2018-01-03 18:29:04 To hell with your aid, we don't need any. It's US who attacked countries in the name of terrorism, rob all their wealth (gold, oil everything) & then keep giving little help to the ppl whose wealth they have looted.

2841 2018-01-03 18:28:41 There's an oil for that.....
2842 2018-01-03 18:28:38 Si ma io sono nel settore del gas oil non mi perdo sulla plastica 
2843 2018-01-03 18:28:33 Some girls get oil pens and immediately become brain dead
2844 2018-01-03 18:28:30 Or maybe the engine opens up like the nose too, so they can put oil in and stuff.
2845 2018-01-03 18:28:19 Kangin get confused about what to teach Kyu,

2850 2018-01-03 18:27:43 I can handle it probably. My Amma used to make me take codliver oil caplets
2851 2018-01-03 18:27:36 Wrong!!!!!
Sanctions have been applied only to corrupt government officials. Venezuela can still trade freely their oil in international markets. The thing is after many year of mismanagement and corruption, the (nationalized) oil industry is in a very sorry state
2852 2018-01-03 18:27:30 80% of Americans getting a tax break. Your solution is to tax everyone more and then return $ to a few.

2854 2018-01-03 18:27:09 dude I use jojoba and rosehip oil on my face because coconut oil clogged my pores-I never said for anyone to stop using it, (even said it works for some,) but it can clog pores! And you made it about color when you mentioned my own, which has nothing to do with skin care.
2855 2018-01-03 18:27:02 We have snack bowls, ice cream (also coconut oil/almond butter) bowls, breakfast and dinner bowls and of course the ice bowls. Four bowls each! Mom washes a lot of dishes.

2859 2018-01-03 18:26:47 I don't think the drop n the DXY so far is enough to b meaningful.
But its fall is causing oil to rise
Below 88 is trouble
2860 2018-01-03 18:26:44 Maybe try some acetone? But, If you’re deck absorbed the oil maybe you should treat the deck with some sealer/stain that will ‘hide’ it
2861 2018-01-03 18:26:36 be sure to shampoo and condition your beard, comb it with a wooden tooth comb and bristle brush, and put some oil and that soft boy

take care of your face you can’t just grow a beard cause you can you gotta look nice
2862 2018-01-03 18:26:34 I’m 100% for natural raw things for skin and hair. I swear to you the best things I’ve tried for my face and hair to make it better have been from natural raw things. Coconut oil, honey, avocado, aloe Vera, etc. they are the bomb

2866 2018-01-03 18:26:12 I was putting oil in my sisters car, and a man came and said would you like me to help you? 
I mean I can do it, daddy aint raise no fool but I like to not have to do things when I don't have to, it's cold outside.
2867 2018-01-03 18:26:11 Yes!! So long as safe includes driving a car with worn out tires, a loose S belt, and in need of an oil change and possibly more power steering fluid :,)

2869 2018-01-03 18:26:03 Soak feet in apple cider Vinegar diluted with water/ or epsom salt. I exfoliate with brown sugar and oil on my heel (rough spot) I do this to my elbows too Sweet Almond oil is good for the cuticle parts. And then on real dry days i put castor oil and socks on to retain moisture.
2870 2018-01-03 18:26:01 Dang, I didn’t even think about the oil leakage.. hmm, after I oil up and run products through my hair, I braid it into big dukey braids so that might help lolol

2875 2018-01-03 18:25:15 Pourquoi devrait-il se restreindre, puisque l'Etat, au travers des remboursements de sécurité sociale accepte joyeusement de se faire escroquer par quelqu'un que les Anglo-saxons appelleraient un "snake oil salesman"
2876 2018-01-03 18:25:10 The trick is to fry on hot oil
 Coat your fish with fish spice mixed with a bit of flour. First coat on an egg mixture then coat on flour mixture. Do not add any salt. While your pan is hot put your fish n let it fry for 2 minutes on low heat then turn until golden brown.

2878 2018-01-03 18:25:09 My skin has been super soft lately. Coconut oil works wonders.
2879 2018-01-03 18:24:49 also the lens here is: sometimes I miss the industrial deep fryers, but we used the countertop fryer so infrequently it wasn't worth dedicating real estate to it.

I've had a lot of fun deep frying in a wok, though! But storing the oil after was ...oily.
2880 2018-01-03 18:24:48 Do you supply the olive oil?
2881 2018-01-03 18:24:42 She said I am "ewu mmanu".

2890 2018-01-03 18:23:57 Hey Gozzie, do you buy Diesel? Have you paid attention to diesel prices? It fluctuates because it's deregulated. It's N200/liter now but has swung from as little as N165/liter to as high as N280/liter over the past couple years. Crude oil prices are not static. Neither is FX.
2891 2018-01-03 18:23:55 You really want to help our troops. Then bring them home. Stop killing our soldiers to defend oil fields

2894 2018-01-03 18:22:59 You know for the people who are super into shipping Poison Ivy and Harley... most Ivy fans don't oppose this, we just want to see Ivy get stories too. What is stopping Harley from packing up and going with Ivy to fight assholes trying to build oil pipelines on indigenous land
2895 2018-01-03 18:22:45 $WTIC is not the price of oil but a hypothetical non-tradable continuous contract so the chart compares this imaginary index with the tracking of price of front month oil futures subject to rollover/contango drift.
2896 2018-01-03 18:22:45 A radio station here in Ghana says that Bushiri got anointing oil at the gates from Heaven from an angel called Gabriel. I am so tired

Don’t lay your edges (keep away from gels.)

Also, have I said to just leave them alone? :-)
2905 2018-01-03 18:22:04 Wow every time a post is made about money in politics & you mention that BOTH parties receive checks every year from Big Pharma, Big Oil and countless other monied interests a number of people unfollow you! Is the truth that difficult to face? The NUMBER ONE PROBLEM IN POLITICS?
2906 2018-01-03 18:21:49 Girl it was so easy! First I just mixed lemon juice and coconut oil and put it in my roots, leave it for like 2 minutes then rinse, then I follow up with a shower and use deep conditioning packets I get from Sally’s, works great 
2907 2018-01-03 18:21:40 ...for oil transshipment, and for the total effect (the sum of those two figures). The oil transshipment figure is taken from the penultimate line of Appendix A (rounded to one decimal point)....2/2
2908 2018-01-03 18:21:33 Have you tried curling day old hair? Maybe having a bit more oil/grime in it will help the curl stay a little better.

Orisha aka Pumpkinsauce: No, it super nasty .
2923 2018-01-03 18:19:09 Yes, well, once we've put in a few decades of work on LCA of EVs, then we can look back and decide whether it was easier or harder than the decades of work you're now standing on with the LCA of oil.
2924 2018-01-03 18:19:01 No we won’t my friend investors still cane in Zim in the height of confusion, we can also go it alone if we stop our greediness, look at how Dubai developed oil from nothing, it’s becoz of no nonsense to corruption

2930 2018-01-03 18:18:36 Yep easier to murder your own country men when you dehumanize them, and turn them into  cartoon characters. UK white nationalist and lead tainted snake oil sales man and performance artist Paul get on it!
2931 2018-01-03 18:18:30 Add oil! 
2932 2018-01-03 18:18:25 Worst thing about Oil's season? They'll finish last and be rewarded with another first or second overall pick to squander. Painful  to watch that play out again.
2933 2018-01-03 18:18:11 prices go up ..there is collusion and its between the oil corporation's and the Canadian government.......
2934 2018-01-03 18:18:11 You must be young. It was this way 4 many, many decades. They pumped your gas, checked your oil & cleaned your windshield. I guess people must think this is a new phenomena when it is actually how it (service stations) started. Didn't always have convenience stores with pumps.
2935 2018-01-03 18:18:01 Coconut oil is one of the most disgusting things you can smell on a girl's hair.

2940 2018-01-03 18:17:30 True story. Worked in a shop & customer's car wouldn't start. Oil light on. Oil level was bone dry. Thought dealership said change oil every 30k miles, not every 3k on new car. Totalled. Young customer was clueless and heartbroken. Tough lesson!
2941 2018-01-03 18:17:29 funny how there is no collusion between the oil corporation's prices climb even when oil is low and rise even more when ...

2945 2018-01-03 18:16:58 The damage to the country, under W. Bush, still haunts me. Oil got richer, we got poorer. Happy to remind anyone of that. Many more bad things he did I know, just that one hurt the worst.
2946 2018-01-03 18:16:55 Term limits for senators, ALL judges, SCOTUS. This old fart shld have left YEARS ago. UTAH, do not shrink the parks for conflict of interest oil. When u r briefly president, you'll disappear like Quayle. You have no voice or backbone or you'd kick  trump into shape.
2947 2018-01-03 18:16:49 You have to b careful with snake oil, not many can handle it
2948 2018-01-03 18:16:47 I put coconut oil on my chapped lips and they turned a pretty shade of pink. What sort of witchery is this??? #okimacoconutoilfannow

2951 2018-01-03 18:16:29 Ahem...A fair and truthful man would mention the financial and trade sanctions in place against Venezuela. They were doing exceptionally well until the price of oil was manipulated down @ 70%. 

BTW, Russia is believed to have the largest oil reserves. Hence Tillerson
2952 2018-01-03 18:16:14 Funny since oil gives them huge funding.

2964 2018-01-03 18:15:06 I don’t think they taught in school but I remember learning about when a river caught fire then I got curious about the test. The fire was from oil on top of the water, in that instance.

2970 2018-01-03 18:14:37 That all big oil exporters are having economic and political problems is actually proof that Fracking has become a more economically viable source of energy for the US

2978 2018-01-03 18:13:41 Do you need a War to make people forget that oh passed the worst tax bill in history, if N Korea had oil I’m sure you would have invaded by now but I guess the USA can’t afford it
2979 2018-01-03 18:13:31 I don't watch CNN. They are snake oil salesmen. South Korea opened the line 1st. North Korea made the call once the "hotline" was re-opened. I'm not saying Trump was or wasn't a factor. I'm saying that we don't yet know what prompted the call.
2980 2018-01-03 18:13:24 Sitting in the repair shop and listening to a guy explain all the things wrong with this poor ladies car when all she came in for was a brake check and oil change....This is why I fucking hate cars

2998 2018-01-03 18:12:00 It is not in their dictionary. They always want the common man to suffer. Imagine what we have, we suffer to get. There are some countries without crude oil,yet they have functioning refineries.
2999 2018-01-03 18:11:52 @CNN trivialized every epilepsy patient who uses cbd oil to stop their seizures or pain from cancer patients who cannot take pain medication by showing marijuana on a party bus and they’ll never apologize nor admit this. #cnn #Marijuanastocks #marijuana #legalization #fakenews

3003 2018-01-03 18:11:12 is there an essential oil to ward off people from talking to me about essential oils
3004 2018-01-03 18:11:07 This is a joke. The reason for the current administration in Iran is because of a US backed despot that they overthrew. Iranians don't need any help from the USA, a country that seems always ready to help when there is oil involved.

3006 2018-01-03 18:10:56 The Fracking method is poisoning the environment. Worry less about dependancy & more about water & air pollution/contamination, oil spills & earthquakes. You cannot breathe & eat oil or gas. Creating jobs is well & good, not at the expense to the environment.
3007 2018-01-03 18:10:55 @DamonCrockett We can respect that -- oil crusts are pretty good! So did you make this pie yourself?
3008 2018-01-03 18:10:55 Hi Jan, we recommend looking into our Ultra Facial Oil Free Gel Cream and Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Daily Cleanser!
3009 2018-01-03 18:10:51 JFR: I might agree that there may be no direct collusion between DT himself and Russians, maybe, but there is enough to link others in his administration.  I’m eager to see Flynn-Bannon connection in Russian oil profits for themselves to come out. It’s there. Nifty little deal
3010 2018-01-03 18:10:49 There’s loads, some glues are really strong which pull your lashes and some aren’t as strong. If you use strong glue you should break the bond with some oil free micellar water. 
3011 2018-01-03 18:10:48 After you wash and condition your hair, put in a leave-in conditioner, then use a curl moisturizer (i use one in the brand Creme of Nature) then seal in the moisture with some vitamin E oil, jamaican black castor oil, or argan oil or mix all three together)
3012 2018-01-03 18:10:44 The care doesn't burn oil/gas... but all the parts are still oil based.  We are still a long ways from oil independence.
3013 2018-01-03 18:10:36 I think the whole “Iran protest” is about stopping the oil pipeline to Europe that Russia , Iran , Turkey and Syria have in the works .

3033 2018-01-03 18:08:33 Freezing does not effect any of our products including probiotic drops. Corn oil will solidify at 12F so transportation in this cold can certainly cause freezing. Just thaw it out by warming to indoor temperature without overheating (keep below 77F) so as not to damage live cells
3034 2018-01-03 18:08:32 Never in my recollection.
3035 2018-01-03 18:08:16 I can change a tire and I can and have changed my own oil and spark plugs.  I not doing it anymore though.  This gas pumping thing is hilarious.

3041 2018-01-03 18:07:31 Do they check your oil and wash the windshields as well?
3042 2018-01-03 18:07:30 Olive oil!!! 

I’d love to get a skillet at some point though

3045 2018-01-03 18:07:14 The richest country in oil and the source of crude oil in the world?   

These wars in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and supporting terrorism in the Middle East ..
3046 2018-01-03 18:07:05 There is no other essential oil.  Maybe some good cold pressed Olive oil if you're fussy about that sort of thing.
3047 2018-01-03 18:06:58 I don’t have the same love and opinion as you guys have for electric. I want to be able to work in my car, chain oil and such. The more computers the harder it gets for weekend mechanics like me. :-( I dont like that.
3048 2018-01-03 18:06:50 Budget cooking hacks: stock up on many different spices; invest in olive oil; always have rice, pasta, and pulses (quick, cheap, healthy). Also adding bay leaves and cardamom to rice is just... just beautiful.  #nomnom #dinner #budget
3049 2018-01-03 18:06:46 As an Oregonian living in CA, have always said "in Oregon, pumping gas isn't just a job, it's a career." That said, have met many attendants who clean windshields, check your oil, etc, cheerfully. So thanks for all your years of caring.
3050 2018-01-03 18:06:42 The attendant always cleaned the windshield, checked the oil & the battery under the hood. Battery's weren't sealed then & could go dry. They noted frayed belts too. We always felt safe when traveling because of that service.

3057 2018-01-03 18:05:41 I'm sure No Dakota is quite beautiful & I hope it remains that way. Trump turning over vast tracts of beautiful wild state land for oil drilling is not a smart way to preserve it. And, no, not interested in an interview, thanks. Sorry.
3058 2018-01-03 18:05:32 I’ve never seen Dash motor oil nor seen Bronald oil
3059 2018-01-03 18:04:44 #Oil prices will remain btwn $40 & $60 pb in 2018 despite the extension of #OPEC-led production cuts thru the end of the year. Higher prices within or above that range will see supply growth as countries lessen their compliance w/production quotas & w/greater US shale production.
3060 2018-01-03 18:04:25 Very good point, Dan, and look at USO. While oil prices have risen, USO market cap is the same as its daily volume: $2m.  If currencies weaken (I think they'll do the opposite the next 2 yrs), commodities will be hot. Otherwise, only good for short-term bets.
3061 2018-01-03 18:03:59 Also using wool is a great way to stretch hair but cover the thread or wool in Shea butter or oil or the wool will dry your hair out and lead to breakage. Also ensure that your plaits aren’t too big. The shorter your hair, the more plaits, the better the stretch.

3065 2018-01-03 18:03:28 It doesnt matter how great sounding they make the union almost half the population doesnt want the union. Its like trying to sell me the greatest sun tan oil ever. It doesnt matter how great it is as a black man I dont want it.

3069 2018-01-03 18:03:02 I have heard stories of people filling their engine with petrol, where the oil is supposed to go. There is nothing so simple that somebody can't screw it up.

3077 2018-01-03 18:02:25 Iran should never have dropped the dallor , now they getting some freedom , America tends to do that with countries that are rich in oil and not interested in US currency, 
This is about more oil and not about Iranians
3078 2018-01-03 18:02:24 No need to apologise. I do appreciate the concern. Really, really.

Our usual heating situation is an oil burning furnace that blows hot air into the house from a grate in the wall. 

On a windy day, you can feel drafts through that grate as well as the ancient windows upstairs.
3079 2018-01-03 18:02:19 What you are planning to do to Alaska and our nation turns my stomach. The story isn't over. We won't give up defending our homelands from your rapacious behaviors. May fierce care for health truly "dominate," not oil and gas.

3088 2018-01-03 18:01:22 Getting my oil changes and tech came to interrupt me from a meeting just ending and says, "So, bad news, the engine has some serious issues..." took a minute to realize he thought I was another customer...LOL #whew
3089 2018-01-03 18:01:16 Pip's permission Rex lighted a small oil lamp, turned it low, and set it on a treat for Ruairidh's end-of-term - ratatouille.
3090 2018-01-03 18:01:16 No one cares about the rhetoric when you have drill rigs in you backyards and next to kids schools. No one cares when they can't sell their house because it looks like an oil field.  Industry has shown no interest in compromise or being neighbors, so here we are.
3091 2018-01-03 18:00:47 Mix 2 quarts broccoli with 1/3 cup dips. Mix into  Olive Oil. Squeeze out excess liquid Serve with chili
3092 2018-01-03 18:00:37 @Aaryn_Williams coconut oil works great too for rashes. My cousin uses it when her kids have diaper rashes.

3094 2018-01-03 18:00:06 I’ve watched it multiple time as well, but without the Oilers bias, it happened, it was a head shot, and it should be suspend worthy. Your handle is “Loyal to the Oil”, so I get you’re a huge fan and might not see this.
3095 2018-01-03 18:00:03 It's not about the color of your skin, it's about your skin type. Coconut oil is specifically harmful for those with oily skin, because no one needs excess oil on their face. And again, I said it works for some people. This had no correlation to ethnicity.

3101 2018-01-03 17:59:48 10-4 on that. Ever seen the huge color oil painting Ostendorf did of Lincoln and the Long 9? It's in the upstairs of the Long 9 Museum in Athens, Illinois...
3102 2018-01-03 17:59:43 Just bought some beauty stuff from my beloved Target. We’ll see how this goes. I bought glow tonic and bio oil. I’m curious.
3103 2018-01-03 17:59:31 @tomleykis wasn't it Venezuela that during high inflation they go thru banks and start randomly sweeping accounts and leaving "IOUs" for the stolen cash? Did you see that story 3 days ago, they are getting into the cryptobubble backed with 5.3B barrels of oil? LOL
3104 2018-01-03 17:59:12 I started eating a lot more seafood when I learned that fish oil was good for my brain.
3105 2018-01-03 17:58:55 Oh ya! Oil change in progress! High end synthetic.. plenty of Scooby snacks on reserve cheers !!
3106 2018-01-03 17:58:53 Its snowing in Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. SEE the earth isnt warming up. 

So here's to a 2018 filled with burning oil, fracking, and cutting down trees.

3109 2018-01-03 17:58:44 all because the oil corporation's want to control Iran's oil . force the Iranian leadership into a corner they may end up....

3112 2018-01-03 17:58:37 Alkaline water is modern snake oil.
3113 2018-01-03 17:58:22 DRIP come on now.  Go!  You don't have to hold overnight if you don't want to.  Lots of stuff in Middle East throwing charts out the window on where oil can go.
3114 2018-01-03 17:58:17 Sounds like you need to find the Oil of Oregano store here in Portage!! #givesgreatgasmileagetoo

3117 2018-01-03 17:57:53 Animals are amazing machines for converting sunlight and inedible grasses into yummy protein and fat. Capitalism turned them into crappy machines for converting crude oil and edible grains into yummy protein and fat.
3118 2018-01-03 17:57:47 Sam, have you done your part to kill the planet today? Because that's what we all want, don't we? I personally went out and poured used motor oil in the lake behind my house. Just because I can. 

Disclosure: no fish or snakes were hurt in the production of this fiction.
3119 2018-01-03 17:57:44 Page Executive revela que el el 18% de las compañías del sector de generación, transporte y distribución de energía eléctrica amplió sus plantillas profesionales. En Oil&Gas es el 38%. Para 2018 esta cifra aumentará al 20% y 40% respectivamente.
3120 2018-01-03 17:57:43 Olive oil and black pepper? I eat Greek yogurt all the time. I've never heard of that. I'll have to try it.
3121 2018-01-03 17:57:39 @kds1947 With oil and gas rising and full assets watch CHK moving up, while other companies ended up with much less assesses
3122 2018-01-03 17:57:26 The LCA of ICE is hard because the LCA of oil is hard. Even if you're only looking at emissions (not, say, EROI) LCA of oil is a much, much bigger problem than just emissions of combustion.
3123 2018-01-03 17:57:22 On John Bolton: “He’s a bomb thrower,” said Ailes. “And a strange little fucker. But you need him. Who else is good on Israel? #Flynn is a little nutty on Iran. #Tillerson just knows oil.” But the MUSTACHE was the problem.  #MichaelWolff

3125 2018-01-03 17:56:59 I actually melt a sq in my Bengal Spice tea (sugar free), or shred and melt with coconut oil, add sliced nanna, then top over wheat free bagel. I googled uses for extra drk choc just because it has so many health benefits and I wanted to wien from other not so healthy choc's
3126 2018-01-03 17:56:55 The only thing you need to know about oil frying is it will make a mess if you let it, it's really re-usable, add a little fresh oil every time you use reused, and if you see smoke it's time to let it go. And, being completely natural and biodegradable, dumping it in yard is best
3127 2018-01-03 17:56:49 Thank you oil companies for the climate change
3128 2018-01-03 17:56:38 Easy. They're sociopaths and would rather leave the problem for future generations to deal with while they prosper from the profits of the oil companies that pay them.
3129 2018-01-03 17:56:30 coconut oil is a MUST for any mixed kid
3130 2018-01-03 17:56:30 And you're going to destroy it with oil rigs from your tax bribe.
3131 2018-01-03 17:56:27 Lol yeah bro. They does buy my Afro Comb and My Brush them. And My Olive Oil Spray . They does get Compliments "treat yuh man right girl"  I does get to laugh. I can't lose
3132 2018-01-03 17:56:25 I've gone to @jiffylube (in Fort McMurray #ymm) for my last 3 synthetic oil changes, at $120 a pop and they have not ONCE, given me my @AIRMILES. Guess I will find somewhere else to go.

3137 2018-01-03 17:56:07 This word is law^^^^ anyone who says otherwise shall be subject to a backhand courtesy of my vegetable oil and salt encrusted mitt.
3138 2018-01-03 17:56:03 I heard that @NGRPresident had a meeting with Oil marketers today. Is it the same oil marketers that they have vowed to punish for hoarding PMS? Something doesn't add up here.
3139 2018-01-03 17:55:55 You fill each empty square with a bit of MOTOR OIL to complete the zoning. It looks rather striking to you. You can hardly imagine that an up and coming young can trying to make it in the world would not be delighted to live in your fair district.
3140 2018-01-03 17:55:40 @T_Fan We hear you there. Did you get the oil changed yet?
3141 2018-01-03 17:55:38 Somebody tell me why I have to pay a doctor for telling me what's wrong with me but not properly fixing the problem? They don't make me pay a mechanic for telling me my fucking oil needs changed.
3142 2018-01-03 17:55:37 Yes I read it. And disagree with you. He posits "Canada" - but focuses mainly on oil industry - as the scrawny kid who has been bullied. He says Canada needs to stop apologizing for its resource industry, ie oil industry.
3143 2018-01-03 17:55:34 Coconut oil is life
3144 2018-01-03 17:55:27 The fight over the control of oil is on! This has been coming; the rebels are likely to be supported by foreign aid and the Iranian government will be toppled.

3146 2018-01-03 17:55:09 $OIL prices continued higher on today as market participants eyed developments in Iran. The country was staging pro-government rallies on the back of six days of protests, although Iranian oil production seemed so far to be unaffected

3151 2018-01-03 17:54:35 Why does it make me feel so self conscious when I’m getting an oil change and they call someone over to look under my hood and start whispering? 
3152 2018-01-03 17:54:33 But them producing more oil doesn't equal having EXCESS oil that would effect you. Which is literally the point I've been making this whole time. Sorry you can't keep up with an educated debate

3154 2018-01-03 17:54:05 Applies to ALL of Congress. Look at those taking money from Big Pharma and Big Oil. Annual checks going to both parties!
3155 2018-01-03 17:53:51 How? Cali had better drugs, bitches, cars, gold/oil, weather, drivers, beaches, education, police force, mountains, and phone service
3156 2018-01-03 17:53:48 hai sir  when can we get your update on oil ?  Have you short...
3157 2018-01-03 17:53:43 I'm not looking down my nose, just saying what I see. While you're talking about long hours in a stressful environment, I worked for 21 years in the Prison Service also worked in the Permian basin on oil rigs. Don't need lectures from actors/writers.
3158 2018-01-03 17:53:37 cari di lorong minyak goreng , kamu cari yg extra virgin olive oil .
3159 2018-01-03 17:53:36 How you look like you bathe in patchouli oil (in all your dreaded fineness) but be betting cardi b's red bottom soul wrote those words... nah baby...
3160 2018-01-03 17:53:36 @MargeryEagan @JimandMargery hate to break it to you, but the Kendall doesn’t use real butter. I’ve asked. I think it’s soy or coconut oil.
3161 2018-01-03 17:53:35 Yeah, just be all confident about only needing the oil change and show them who is boooosssss.
3162 2018-01-03 17:53:23 So our furnace just won’t turn on even tho the oil is completely full now lmao this is great I love living in an ancient home
3163 2018-01-03 17:52:56 They are out of Gasoline.... Not oil....
3164 2018-01-03 17:52:52 $SDRL -offshore rigs vastly oversupplied for next 2 years (fleet utilization below 60%)

3165 2018-01-03 17:52:51 Interesting. So, selling out the state to big oil & natural gas didn’t result in a boom? Just more earthquakes than CA? Intrigued to hear from someone on the ground there! Thx!
3166 2018-01-03 17:52:44 “He’s a bomb thrower,” said Ailes. “And a strange little fucker. But you need him. Who else is good on Israel? Flynn is a little nutty on Iran. Tillerson just knows oil.”
3167 2018-01-03 17:52:31 Depends on which ingredients you’re adding. MCT oil has fatty acids that enhance brain function and give energy. Collage is good for skin and I’m assuming the cinnamon is better for your body than sugar esp for digestion but I’m not so familiar with that one.
3168 2018-01-03 17:52:24 @JimandMargery hate to break it to you, but the Kendall doesn’t use real butter. I’ve asked. I think it’s soy or coconut oil.
3169 2018-01-03 17:52:17 @jimbraude Corby’s info about coconut oil is incorrect. This is a supremely good oil to cook with. Olive oil should not be used in cooking as it becomes rancid when cooked on higher heat. It’s great to add after cooking!
3170 2018-01-03 17:52:15 Cold pressed black castor oil, bro! 
3171 2018-01-03 17:52:15 The numbers are staggering.  Find a site that shows team goals for/against on PP and PK.  Take the averages and compare to Oil.  The difference of just being average is enormous.  The impact on standings is enormous.
3172 2018-01-03 17:52:05 the smell of sesame oil cooking is fucking gorgeous.
3173 2018-01-03 17:52:04 Just bring back In Living Color.
3174 2018-01-03 17:52:02 Am I the only oily skin person that likes looking dewy? Like that finish that you get right before your mug turns into an oil slick??
3175 2018-01-03 17:51:57 try castor oil!! it taste disgusting but many women swear by it
3176 2018-01-03 17:51:49 Correct they are. So when China calls in the Trillion dollar debt we owe them American people will toil on their land they own her for oil, minerals and coal. Trump has turned America into a 3rd world country in 1 year. Look at the big picture not the small pieces
3177 2018-01-03 17:51:48 Exactly!! More than one billion people are using biomass and cooking with dung, have no access to hot water ...they would love some natural gas ....you sit in your toasty NY home, no doubt powered by gas and oil. And pontificate

3181 2018-01-03 17:51:17 Isn't it incredible what good use of N. Sea oil revenue can do for a small nation given a chance. Scottish NHS has been held up as an example for rUK to follow - you perhaps are too far down the food chain to get that particular memo, we don't want the Tory model in Scotland.

3192 2018-01-03 17:49:40 Sinus/Allergy or Flu/Common cold? I use essential oils Lemon, Lavender and Peppermint in a glass and drink/put on my neck to breathe it in. Common cold I use lemon in tea and sleep with Thieves oil on my feet.
3193 2018-01-03 17:49:29 $GE the only reason it’s higher is because oil is up.  Remember, sometimes dookie floats but always gets flushed.   
3194 2018-01-03 17:49:26 Standup sounded fun until the oil wrestling and child molesters
3195 2018-01-03 17:49:26 I get oil changes at the same place and it’s always with the same guy, he can tell it’s me when i pull up lmaoo
3196 2018-01-03 17:49:19 What works for you? I use cetaphil, a neutrogena toner, then coconut oil
3197 2018-01-03 17:49:17 Back to my tweet of Nov. 30th 2016, i stated when everyone was looking for $30 oil that a 50% retracement from the drop would take it to $60-65 sometime in 2017....we broke $60 (WTI) last day of '17...nobody's perfect!!

3200 2018-01-03 17:48:48 Yes, because they push what companies will sell. If they put meat at the base, how it should be, they would be selling meat products, healthy or not. But better that chips in veg oil
3201 2018-01-03 17:48:42 Well Dayum!!!
3202 2018-01-03 17:48:18 Canada doesn't but the oil. Private companies do. The whole purpose of getting a line to port is for export. Not to allow for the use domestically.
3203 2018-01-03 17:48:17 Let's celebrate by giving more tax breaks to billionaires and allowing Big Oil to drill the crap out of our beautiful home! Yay!
3204 2018-01-03 17:48:15 It's olive oil and salt right?
3205 2018-01-03 17:48:12 Yep. We’re rural. 

Can people start concierge gas stations again where they check your oil and tire pressure, wash your windows, etc? I would pay extra from time to time.

3211 2018-01-03 17:47:22 Starting off the new year with an oil change for my car and then come Friday, a new pricey piece for the car. Good thing I’ve worked so many hours in the last week that I can finally afford it.

3219 2018-01-03 17:45:39 “some of y’all stay doing too much,” i say as i prepare to take an uber to the mall to pick up my car so i can drive home and pick up two 2.5 gallon gas tanks to fill with diesel fuel to put in my oil burner so i don’t feeeze this winter
3220 2018-01-03 17:45:25 I’m getting my oil changed and this guy just left the waiting area to take a phone call outside and he was literally YELLING into his phone and me and the other person in here just looked at each other like 
3221 2018-01-03 17:45:19 DEF OF A WOLF-need to start with the basics again? Go around Congress like CLINTONS/enigma lie for political cash or oil or opm / 912 SECRET SERVERS OPM-gold transfers/un-willy NK/IRAN & hitliary med opium sales/know where military's located using passwords?
3222 2018-01-03 17:45:17 On #Armageddon: Is it easier to teach oil drillers to be astronauts than vice versa? LOL.
3223 2018-01-03 17:45:06 Damn shame that so many millions have had to suffer and die before people finally woke up.  This "same old" script is the lie to #steal #Oil #resources  and #wealth. #Iraq #Libya #Syria
3224 2018-01-03 17:45:03 No they just have broken bones/ legs  from chemo. This is a disgrace. St Johns hosp's neglected for too long. 2 closed just prior to pop> & oil boom. Property sits at Grace w/ No new waterford MH hosp as promised by Libs. Libs building rural Labr road infrast & CB Hosp? #nlpoli
3225 2018-01-03 17:44:46 @Sarge986 After all playing oil thru the pipelines was YOUR call.Fancy.
3226 2018-01-03 17:44:46 AND I was literally just drive on pokemon go rip to get castor oil for mitchie m new exeggcutor lol but the same thing when
3227 2018-01-03 17:44:41 I needed an oil change asap, i forgot my money in the office and the nice man at the gas station did it for free 
3228 2018-01-03 17:44:33 Motor oil problems?  Talk to me. I am a Lubrizol trained motor oil specialist.
3229 2018-01-03 17:44:26 Hurry before the kids eat it all hahahahhaah
3230 2018-01-03 17:44:17 @Sarge986 Re my query about oil and pipelines a couple of weeks ago r u still cynical?How about the arctic?
3231 2018-01-03 17:44:06 The only thing I wanna eat today is pizza dripping in truffle oil
3232 2018-01-03 17:44:05 Olive oil is my saving grace! Slather that shit everywhere
3233 2018-01-03 17:43:52 Haha! Here I was believing the internet! You fooled me again.
3234 2018-01-03 17:43:50 Lord have mercy.  This is just as petty as when the Colts, after Deflategate was on an dpoppin' hung an "AFC Finalist" banner in Lucas Oil Stadium that still flies to this day. #nobueno
3235 2018-01-03 17:43:22 ちょっと右肘とかいたかったんで絵があんまり描けなかったのもおおきい
3236 2018-01-03 17:43:14 Says the dude that promised to wipe out millions of innocent N. Korean civilians...exactly the opposite of Christ's teachings at the Sermon on the Mount.
Do people really buy this, when he steals religious talk as part of his snake and oil PR used car salesmen routine?
3237 2018-01-03 17:43:11 Check your Transmission oil today.
3238 2018-01-03 17:43:09 Good, stop giving money to Israel then for military ventures and stealing Middle Eastern oil
3239 2018-01-03 17:43:01 Ugh... The last 100+ km of Texas has smelled like an oil refinery.
3240 2018-01-03 17:43:00 my oil change was free amd they washed my car too ily subaru 
3241 2018-01-03 17:42:45 Lol Rich got duped. The part that fixed you was the massage + Ktape. The rest was just snake oil to make you feel like you had to come back to him and not any other chiro
3242 2018-01-03 17:42:44 It also absorbs more which is why it produces more. Glad to help you come to this conclusion. And if it's not excess to them, they can't transfer said "excess oil" to you, which was my point stupid. And cosmetology perpetuates a lot of falsehoods, I wouldn't be proud of that
3243 2018-01-03 17:42:43 @realDonaldTrump Trumpo North Korea will get there Oil from a communist country many of them so cutting their oil out just isn’t going to happen without war so give north Korea something to think about South Korea will have nukes
3244 2018-01-03 17:42:33 I tell people about this oil all the time. My girl just bought it off your site.
3245 2018-01-03 17:42:29 so it sort of seems like the russians are playing us. i'm guessing they're real interested in driving a wedge between us & saudi arabia to try to drive oil prices up to a level where it's cost effective to drill in their arctic lands.
3246 2018-01-03 17:42:16 I felt bad asking my dad to change my oil in this weather so I went to an actual mechanic and fuck it’s expensive 
3247 2018-01-03 17:42:03 In my elementary school we routinely had heating issues. More than once my temperature dropped to 92 degrees. My dad, 5’9 jolly looking Irish guy, screamed st the principle, the archdiocese, and sat in the office calling oil companies until they fixed it.
3248 2018-01-03 17:41:58 Sometimes, it’s not about all the diamonds and fancy dates. Fellas...when is the last time you’ve gotten your lady oil changed? #SimpleButMeaningful
3249 2018-01-03 17:41:38 Strongest man for your village sitdown ontop akara oil no come out
3250 2018-01-03 17:41:32 It's a slippery slope. First you pump, then clean the windshield, check the oil, and oh, the tires look a bit low so where my pressure gauge?
Then the valve cap rolls under the car.

3252 2018-01-03 17:41:24 yeah, I like big Oil for Energy (global)
3253 2018-01-03 17:41:21 Filled up the car's wiper fluid and checked oil/antifreeze, still topped out. Cooking the guys burgers while they're playing Monster Hunter Gen upstairs. Chill day
3254 2018-01-03 17:41:21 Hate the way british and arguably world sport has sold its soul to the oil rich sheikhs who really don't care about the sport and just see it as a money maker
3255 2018-01-03 17:41:12 Interesting moment in Crude Oil - strong resistance at 62.0 - 62.5, backwardation - Dec19 - 55.5 and huge speculative position.
3256 2018-01-03 17:41:12 Olive Oil is good if you want to put it on bread.
3257 2018-01-03 17:41:12 Are they still going to be able to pump your gas if you don’t want to? I remember I used to like the full service stations every once in a while for the oil and tire checks! Then CA got rid of them all.
3258 2018-01-03 17:40:38 LMFAO
Yashar starts it

Paulie did the prep work
He would use a razor to slice the garlic. it would liquify in the pan w/ just a little oil
3259 2018-01-03 17:40:32 This Joya oat drink with chia oil is so great 
3260 2018-01-03 17:40:20 Air in a tire? Nah man but Can I get help checking my oil? I can’t find it lol! 
3261 2018-01-03 17:40:19 @LAKingsPR now that Frozen Fury is no more, how about Forum Fury? Kings/Ducks (or better yet, the Oil) at the Forum would be beyond epic.
3262 2018-01-03 17:40:09 ぼくに言わせればワセリンすら食用だよ。
3263 2018-01-03 17:40:09 Odio ese pensamiento que tienen los mayores de que los menores no pueden opinar, cuando muchas veces los menores pensamos mejor que los mayores
3264 2018-01-03 17:40:00 DOE at oil companies, nagpulong sa isyu ng excise tax
3265 2018-01-03 17:39:59 Pakistan starting trade oil in juan with china 
3266 2018-01-03 17:39:55 I ordered oil . Got 100 gallons 2 weeks ago. 20 percent left. 600 bucks gone today. Hate that. Rather have wood burn stove and start splitting wood. Its great exercise.
3267 2018-01-03 17:39:49 Anyone have a solution to removing oil stains off of treated wood? Guest had a leaky power steering hose then we all stepped in it and brought oil onto the deck.
3268 2018-01-03 17:39:45 Bigger risk to be dependent on other nations for our oil. Of course Dems want our citizens to be dependent. Easier to control us
3269 2018-01-03 17:39:45 $BHP. Staying long even up here.  They are the supermarket of stuff that comes out of the ground.  Iron, Coal, Copper, Oil, Nat Gas, ….  If the commodity watch out
3270 2018-01-03 17:39:41 Take it to a mechanic and have a reading. Could be the oil pump is going out. What happened to out mazda.
3271 2018-01-03 17:39:35 Yes it does, you are literally stating something that is false. Skin is completely permeable to oil
3272 2018-01-03 17:39:31 Black Jamaican castor oil is the plug for hair growth. And by doing protective styles like braids often, you'll notice alot of growth as well.
3273 2018-01-03 17:39:11 That ugly ass pimple on my cheek finally went away. Y’all tea tree oil, vitamin E oil, and water is really key 
3274 2018-01-03 17:38:38 That’s my issue right now I’ve been using tea tree oil products for my oily skin and my forehead and nose are so dried out now that there’s a lot of texture now
3275 2018-01-03 17:38:25 TIL/life hack: makeup remover wipes are great at cutting through grease and oil & therefore are PERFECT to have on hand for such emergencies as "my partner ate a bunch of hot sauce and then went down on me"
3276 2018-01-03 17:38:22 Good day for oil markets
3277 2018-01-03 17:38:15 my whole fb post about my oil change is hilarious cuz people say stupid shit n i can’t help but to reply like a dick
3278 2018-01-03 17:38:13 It can, and does, get stupider. Reliance on and continued subsidies to RE, makes burning oil or coal unprofitable. You need to subsidize the oil/coal so they stay in business for when you need them. Coal is now subsidized in the UK for this reason. I strongly suspect oil in NE
3279 2018-01-03 17:38:09 bas aik tea tree oil kaafi hai
3280 2018-01-03 17:38:00 He thinks the bone to be my wandering salad sooner than my plaintext bun upon my olive oil in oil.
3281 2018-01-03 17:37:56 You can mix all of them or use them separately. But if you’re using Castor oil, you should mix it with one of those oils cause of the smell
3282 2018-01-03 17:37:54 He  who  loves  wine  and  oil  will  not  be  rich
3283 2018-01-03 17:37:53 He's trying to differentiate between 5ltrs and 1ltr of oil
3284 2018-01-03 17:37:52 how many people were bashing $energy and $oil under 30$, 40$, 50$ and now 60$ they all loving it........lol
3285 2018-01-03 17:37:48 Mmm ...idk nigga, yeen gotta build me a bed from scratch. But at least know how to change oil and fix some shit. 
3286 2018-01-03 17:37:48 If you love  it so much why ?? Why ? Why ? Did you agree to let oil corporations drill in protective land after 40 years of protection? You know that there is no such thing as “good” drilling. Plus we are less dependent on oil not more. Renewable energy is the best. Happy Birth
3287 2018-01-03 17:37:43 Wow, Alex, what an interesting concept for a perfect role for rapscallion Ray!! He and Houseman were like oil and water in their personae.
3288 2018-01-03 17:37:41 Are you familiar with both the global EROI decline and the overestimated reserves of both oil and coal? Some authors call that phenomenon a 'terminal energy decline'.
3289 2018-01-03 17:37:31 Oh I’ll oil you up!!!
3290 2018-01-03 17:37:07 But it does account for overall moisture levels. You made a claim that block people give off more EXCESS OIL, which that study does not back up at all because an oil that is being naturally absorbed(which it's easier for their skin to do, due to have a lower water content) is

3293 2018-01-03 17:36:49 I know. He’s just saying that they’re right. And following years of wars for oil and money, I wouldn’t want to be guilty of standing by as real evil is being perpetrated. Iran is the biggest state sponsor of terrorism on earth. And note; no women in the pro regime marches...
3294 2018-01-03 17:36:48 So that’s how it’s supposed to be run! Man the Oil do not even come close to running it this was Hence the 70% number.

3296 2018-01-03 17:36:40 Hilarious that my car service @SevenoaksVW (full service and oil change) took the same amount of time as my own service @Miramira_beauty (microderm facial and back neck shoulder massage) 
#vwgolf #westmalling #headteacherwellbeing #backtoschool #elemis
3297 2018-01-03 17:36:29 AND that’s w me moisturizing w jojoba oil which is oily AF so be careful..it is a cheaper alternative tho and is useful for all skin types 
3298 2018-01-03 17:36:23 I sat in my car during the oil change lol
3299 2018-01-03 17:36:18 Girl oil fields are the worst 
3300 2018-01-03 17:36:16 To the oil fields I go
3301 2018-01-03 17:36:06 The oil feed banjo bolt is actually higher up at the top of the head, easy to get to and don’t even need to remove the turbo. That’s already removed (AFTER it took out my turbo). Luckily I have a couple spare TD04s haha.
3302 2018-01-03 17:36:03 Correct but not all states have the same access to barrels of oil as others and the average price generally comes out about the same being a coastal state with ports.
3303 2018-01-03 17:35:57 Brake light replaced, new wipers, power steering flush, oil change, fluids topped off...dammit, I'm jealous of my car.
3304 2018-01-03 17:35:56 Jan 3 reason to vote for me on March 6:

I actually understand the oil industry.
#byebyeted
3305 2018-01-03 17:35:41 @JamesSeltzer I had a duck as a pet. Ducks have oil in their feathers that keep them warm. They actually need the unfrozen water to pull the oil out of feathers. The flying V are geese not ducks. Ducks don't travel in groups typically, just pairs.

3309 2018-01-03 17:35:14 But the Items for Bilateral trade were Identified. For eg. Crude Oil, Diamond imports from USSR were not in the list. India's over 90% imports were defence purchases. USSR imported Modi-Xerox, Glaxo(India), Pfizer(India) Ashok-Leyland type of semi-western products.

3312 2018-01-03 17:34:59 How does selling badly performing stocks, as most coal, oil, and gas have been, hurt returns?
3313 2018-01-03 17:34:58 Russia is doing what we use to do. Turkey know buy's weapons from them not us. Russia gives oil to North Korea and trump say's nothing. Russia gave the technology to North Korea for nuclear weapons. Russia gave technology of Internet for cyber attacks. I guess Russia is taking it
3314 2018-01-03 17:34:46 Again? Another Oil & Gas coup no doubt, Africa's resources, always a source of inspiration for regime change.
3315 2018-01-03 17:34:42 Oil is the only choice, give renewable energy 20-30 years and it might be a feasible replacement
3316 2018-01-03 17:34:34 vape oil. Please I must see

3318 2018-01-03 17:33:58 Olive oil keep me smooth on the inside
3319 2018-01-03 17:33:50 There is no regulation that would put oil & gas out of biz. You know how much those suckers profit? Usually at our expense when there are no regs or they aren't enforced.
3320 2018-01-03 17:33:43 The two games I just watched the Oil pay the Jets, Khaira looked good. 

He's definitely not 2nd line material, but he looks like a solid bottom 6 nhler.
3321 2018-01-03 17:33:35 there's been research, everyone does. I do. Flour and oil and potatoes, you can live a while
3322 2018-01-03 17:33:29 Do you know WTF TEWL is??? And do you know that natural skin oil is WATER RESISTANT. Jesus.
3323 2018-01-03 17:33:22 There is nothing sadder than the realization that any idea of a “loyal opposition” has vanished and it’s all party before country plus a healthy dash of personality cult for that snake oil salesmen.

3337 2018-01-03 17:31:31 Oh my gosh! Is Pennsylvania having an environmental conscience? Ask the people who lost their homes, communities, tainted water resources, earth tremmers from fracking. PA state GOP'ers has long ago sold out their state to the oil industry and now they are worried, to late.
3338 2018-01-03 17:31:30 it is so cold that all of my oil based brow & cam’s hair stuff is chunking up into solids.
what has global warming made of us?
3339 2018-01-03 17:31:17 cause once you speak bullshit seeps like oil leaks ...
3340 2018-01-03 17:31:16 The last time short positions fell to these "extreme" lows, the #oil market saw a more than 20 percent correction, said John LaForge, head of Real Asset Strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
3341 2018-01-03 17:31:11 Korea leader is about Japan. US wants to stick their beak in. So Korea mad not backing down. I say "what  these grown men are clowning for is so media takes away the attention of Iran's babies starving because saudis place dictator in Iran to send all Iran oil&moneys to saudis!!"

3347 2018-01-03 17:30:03 We could have peace in the Middle East, our you could have cheap oil. Can’t have both
3348 2018-01-03 17:29:53 Go back to the source and then tell us how much the countries charging highest tax ask for.
3349 2018-01-03 17:29:46 Who hasn't figured out that oil and water is the best skincare routine yet?
3350 2018-01-03 17:29:46 We have been -10 or more at night for, what, a week now? It’s nuking us. We have a small, ma and pa heating oil company. They’ve worked every day since 12/23, all day, all night. The school’s sprinker pipes froze and burst. They closed 2 days for damage and because no heat.
3351 2018-01-03 17:29:45 Just seen a place that do 10 dollar oil changes
3352 2018-01-03 17:29:40 "But First buy my lead tainted snake oil" you are gross. Infomercial snake oil salesman.
3353 2018-01-03 17:29:19 Most of mine had to do with after I got to Alaska and took a tech/IT/field position for an oil outfit.

Marrying a southern belle put the kibosh on that.
3354 2018-01-03 17:29:12 In 2018 I'm cascading my life in coconut oil, argon oil, mint almond oil, essential oils all that shit. 
3355 2018-01-03 17:29:08 Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!
3356 2018-01-03 17:29:03 Iran have a lot of oil, isn't it ?

3485 2018-01-03 17:14:14 The relevant question is taxing "sin" better than taxing virtue?  Is it better to increase the alcohol tax and lower the payroll tax? Is it better to tax oil than give subsidies to solar?  Does the book address these kinds of trade-offs?

Or did the oil sands $ ruin parenting???
3500 2018-01-03 17:11:48 And look what happened to the keystone pipeline. It wasn't even completed a year and it already had a major oil spil. But the regulations made it safer for the common person.
3501 2018-01-03 17:11:42 Still tak dapat chance sebab duit takdak. Haha castor oil Ada banyak positive review though.

3506 2018-01-03 17:11:04 Record high US oil exports in 2017 are expected, according to preliminary data in a report by the Energy Information Administration. US oil imports continued to far outpace exports. Canada, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela were the largest foreign suppliers of crude oil to the US,
3507 2018-01-03 17:11:02 The country with the largest oil reserves in the world has run out of gasoline. 
Good job socialism.
3508 2018-01-03 17:11:01 Oil and gold have been strong, but notwithstanding geo-pol events both charts have been exhibiting breakout potential for some time, especially crude. Posted here numerous times.

3510 2018-01-03 17:10:57 The Rothschild Khazar Puppets Trump and Macron don’t need to worry about Iran. They need to slow down. The Oil in the Golan Hights are still under the earth and yet they are seeking some more
3511 2018-01-03 17:10:56 Beard oil takes care of the scratchy feeling.
3512 2018-01-03 17:10:52 I agree.  The entire global oil industry should be a punching bag, of course that would include the Canada. Terry Etam wouldn't by any chance have a vested interest in Canada's energy industry, would he?
3513 2018-01-03 17:10:51 Pearl Harbor yes, 9/11 not so much. The 2 wars that came after that had nothing to do with the twin towers. It was just a reason to justify going to war over oil.

3533 2018-01-03 17:09:07 The bottoming out of oil prices is not the cause?

Hmm, guess you have an axe to grind that supersedes common sense, and the truth.

Bless you and keep you.
3534 2018-01-03 17:09:04 Perky today & sounds like +ve broker notes..could move quickly on Jan update but see a few now shorting oil so bit wary..

3542 2018-01-03 17:08:20 your opinion wouldn't have anything to do with needing oil money to help fund your provincial election campaign?  Diversity including green renewable initiatives is the key to long term eco growth. Haven't learned that yet? #abpoli
3543 2018-01-03 17:08:03 Always remember that anybody with an ‘A’ Series engine claiming that theirs doesn’t leak oil probably has no oil in it 
3544 2018-01-03 17:08:00 Cup need an oil change.

3546 2018-01-03 17:07:41 Oil prices need to get hammered for rig counts to drop and natty to rise

3555 2018-01-03 17:07:12 I think about this though cause dudes that pick em seem to strike oil. I'd say much often than a woman tends to get lucky in choosing...

but honestly we all know why that is....cause the pool for one is better than the next. But I like to look at the flip side of things...

3560 2018-01-03 17:06:52 The money is actually to create more BILLIONAIRES and MILLIONAIRES at the expense of "we the people". Too bad WALL ST. is in bed with VIRTU PARTNERS in YUGO. taking up gas/heating oil
3561 2018-01-03 17:06:30 Got an oil change yesterday; they forgot to screw a cap back on and my oil leaked out, 2019 my year for sure
3562 2018-01-03 17:06:30 orb up to three times as much oil as naturally straight hair.  The Truth of the matter is Black skin and scalp produce up to three times as much natural oils and sebum as Caucasian."
3563 2018-01-03 17:06:27 Oil kills fish, coal kills habitats, nuclear kills animals. Sometimes something has to die. Don’t make it the human race #sci9
3564 2018-01-03 17:06:19 follow the $$$ trail,,, Russian Oil + Greed = Drumpf and all of the GOP involved and working OT to try to cover it up.

3566 2018-01-03 17:06:14 Usually it's organ meat, orange veggies (squash, etc) and maybe some other veg, coconut oil, and a little 'extra' like flax seed or turmeric and cinnamon for extra nutrition. She also doesn't mind the wiltry-but-still good veggies that the kids turn their noses up at.
3567 2018-01-03 17:06:03 y’all are tripping over coconut oil when the real winner is vapor rub 
3568 2018-01-03 17:06:00 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
3569 2018-01-03 17:05:52 To further the discussion. Although oil was discovered in Persia in 1908, it wasn't discovered in other M.E. countries until later, specifically in Iraq (1927), Bahrain (1932), Qatar (1935), Saudia Arabia & Kuwait (1938), U.A.E. (1958) and Oman in 1964.

3576 2018-01-03 17:04:52 Nice distinction. I always thought of olive/coconut/avocado oil as better than seed oils simply because they don't require industrial processes for extraction. Never considered the fruit/veg distinction.
3577 2018-01-03 17:04:43 Senator Nelson,  again I remind you leaders have solutions to problems.once again you just whine about what you perceive as a problem. Would you have us endanger our young men and women as we depend on middle east oil ?

3586 2018-01-03 17:03:47 The guy at jiffy lube has offered to replace my wiper blades twice when I've gotten my oil changed and the last time I told him "it doesn't rain in hell" if the 113 thing is true then I guess it actually hasn't rained between these oil changes lol
3587 2018-01-03 17:03:35 Not interested in what big coal and oil companies have to say. I make my own mind up and am deeply sceptical about man made global warming.

3595 2018-01-03 17:02:44 Agreed, ban oil and gas on the St.Lawrence. We also need to ensure that what happened in #Lac-Mégantic is never repeated so shipping by rail must also stop.

3637 2018-01-03 16:58:44 Not what you want to hear, on Iran concerns, oil surging to $61.41/bbl, wholesale #gasprices up 5-11c/gal depending on region. Happy New Year? Nah.
3638 2018-01-03 16:58:23 This lady who died on 24th December cos of Breast cancer battled this cancer for 2 years. She refused for the doctors to cut her breasts cos she said her pastor in Ghana prayed over an oil for her to use and the pastor insisted she shouldn’t go under the knife. She is dead.

3641 2018-01-03 16:58:12 I’m done with Hennessy man.... I really can’t inject that oil in my body in 2018
3642 2018-01-03 16:58:03 Laging kawawa si Oil. Ganda mo naman kase Pang. Parang lahat ng lalaki sa campus gusto ka. FYI mas maganda si Mali

3644 2018-01-03 16:57:57 Yep! I use them daily myself too. Diffuse them, bathe in them, oil pull with some. Love EE’s
3645 2018-01-03 16:57:42 Oil prices rising but pdvsa production falling and company in deep crises.default on unsecured bonds effectively at $ 26.5 billion. Share in Caribbean refineried crumbling. Who will save Maduro unclear. time for opposition to unite
3646 2018-01-03 16:57:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
3647 2018-01-03 16:57:29 I’m supposed to drive to Chicago tomorrow and my car is trashed, I need an oil change, and I need to change my cracked headlight. All by tomorrow. Yet here I am, watching Grey’s.

3649 2018-01-03 16:57:27 Try adding a tablespoon of Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil to your diet. Also use a little olive oil on your skin you will see better results than the moisturizer.
3650 2018-01-03 16:57:17 Epic reply
3651 2018-01-03 16:57:00 @zapopovec OIL IS SOARING
3652 2018-01-03 16:56:51 They don’t know that “planet” or, is that a “country”?, anyway they don’t care there is not oil over there
3653 2018-01-03 16:56:47 Hey snowflake, must be hard waking up every day knowing tiny Israel has in 70 years surpassed the skills and production of everything but oil compared to the other Middle East countries.
3654 2018-01-03 16:56:43 I’m now blocked was going to explain how oil prices affected  economy
3655 2018-01-03 16:56:19 Brahhh  and CBD oil is a schedule 1 drug
3656 2018-01-03 16:56:17 I think CNG (transitioning to bio-CNG) will substitute diesel fuel for commercial fleets (bus/taxi mobility & freight). Iran went down this road since using CNG freed up oil/products for export
3657 2018-01-03 16:56:16 Elaboration: LOTS of oil. Current portion is 33% of total mix and obviously this is just the beginning of winter. What century is this?
3658 2018-01-03 16:56:14 Why is it taking so long for them to change my car oil 
3659 2018-01-03 16:56:06 It might actually be someone who was genuinely concerned after seeing it at a party/ whatever. And then leaving it a bit before reporting to make sure it’s out of system for test (I was a medic in Aberdeen at height of oil, & my Mrs was a CCU Nurse there)
3660 2018-01-03 16:56:02 You’re kidding right Senator. He’s just pushed to have national monuments open for exploitation by oil and gas. He pushed Tom Price , he’s a racist and supporter of Trump.
3661 2018-01-03 16:55:54 @oloumaldar Your Highness should know in 1976 I had given two large framed portrait paintings free to your father HH Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan requsting to do justice and ask HH @HHShkMohd, his late brother and father to pay for 40 oil paintings, but I never received!
3662 2018-01-03 16:55:53 Benny, Happy new year and oil fresh.
3663 2018-01-03 16:55:38 hoe ass oil got my tooth hurting
3664 2018-01-03 16:55:34 @HealthyStirling Do you guys have CBD Oil in your store? Id love the opportunity at supplying you and working with you on some CBD oil products we have. Please msg me back when you get an opportunity. Look forward to working with you
3665 2018-01-03 16:55:25 Putting oil in my hair is a waste of time unless it’s immediately after washing it or wetting it in the shower.
3666 2018-01-03 16:55:21 Ok i need to relax i m getting too hyper  i gotta say this if bb comes in front of him I'll fry him in oil
3667 2018-01-03 16:55:19 I hate when car places try to take advantage of women when they’re in for simple oil changes. Biiiitch, I may be car-stupid but the men in my life aren’t 
3668 2018-01-03 16:55:01 Trying to, downeast won’t deliver oil/propane! Huber in harpswell
3669 2018-01-03 16:54:55 If I can kill a Divine Beast in BoTW, I can learn how to change the oil in my car.
3670 2018-01-03 16:54:50 No they don’t, they would be just happy with the oil price going up, but if that is the case, they won’t pass the opportunity, but, always a but, as long US taxpayers pay for the war bill
3671 2018-01-03 16:54:49 People think oil is cheap and we are in a supposed supply glut but oil is 30-40% higher than pre 2000 average (if you take out politically induced 70s oil crisis)
3672 2018-01-03 16:54:49 bitch go to the one next to pizza hut they change oil
3673 2018-01-03 16:54:37 Top scorer will be lacazette.. most assists should be oil if he stay and player of the year will be wilshere

3676 2018-01-03 16:54:15 5 weeks into keto and lost 14lbs so far. Feeling great! My favorite breakfast: 5 fatty pork patties fried in avocado oil, 2 cups spinach and 2 whole avocados, lots of salt. Love this way of eating 
Tell me your #keto journey   #ketodiet #ketogenicdiet eat #realFood
3677 2018-01-03 16:54:10 @ShereenBhan
Yes would allow full time leaves in genuine cases.
That too all payments made.
We have to keep checking Vegetable Oil Quality in India.
3678 2018-01-03 16:54:06 Some thoughts on the latest @TransitionShow episode on LCA:

1. Great to hear the discussion on land use.
2. The solar end of life research is very interesting
3. I agree with Garvin about the need for research on oil supply chain, but combustion will always be > than upstream.
3679 2018-01-03 16:54:01 I've been long oil since mid summer and debating closing out some.
3680 2018-01-03 16:53:57 Oh geez, and I can’t get downeast to deliver propane/oil before storm. We are on coast of Harpswell, I know we’ll lose power. Last time it was 10 days!
3681 2018-01-03 16:53:52 Prince Talal dies, and oil does.
3682 2018-01-03 16:53:41 thankcha! A lot of people don’t make it this far. And some oil wrecked when they do. I feel so blessed
3683 2018-01-03 16:53:37 Kim Jong: I have nuclear button on my desk.

Trump: I have bigger nuclear button on my desk. 

Shahid Kapoor: I have clinic all clear oil on my desk.
3684 2018-01-03 16:53:36 It's a disaster waiting to happen. 

Its oil probably hasn't been changed in 20k miles either.
3685 2018-01-03 16:53:18 from @PSNITraffic reports of an oil spillage in Melmount Rd, #Strabane & Beltany Rd #Omagh  - A5 - Drivers should exercise caution in both areas #CoTyrone (16:50)

3688 2018-01-03 16:52:44 Love it when my fish oil give me reflux.
3689 2018-01-03 16:52:40 I went into a Whole Foods and couldn't find the cold medicine. I did find lots of homeopathic remedies. Come on, I'm trying to get better, not start home schooling while experimenting with peppermint oil.

3691 2018-01-03 16:52:39 I’m sitting waiting to get my oil changed and two screaming kids come in and the parents are swearing at them and I feel like I’m on what would you do and someone please help me
3692 2018-01-03 16:52:38 Khan is a leader not puppet like you and your master Panama Sharif. Khan stands against so called war of terror at begins and then your masters spending time in oil malish of kings...
3693 2018-01-03 16:52:36 I don’t see oil and bitcoin related in this context the question on energy and China is coal, #natgas and renewables and in the context of the new clean energy policy
3694 2018-01-03 16:52:26 Sniffing olbas oil like it’s poppers I miss u unblocked nose
3695 2018-01-03 16:52:25 Umm...genius, US could have taken Iraq's oil but didn't. Syria issues - Obama screwed it up 100%. Palestinians? They wallow in misery and fake deaths for world sympathy. Sick culture u support.
3696 2018-01-03 16:52:22 from Revel, Microscopic Chief  and his group are using the powers  to run the economy of oil
3697 2018-01-03 16:52:16 Yeah I don’t follow his point, or don’t agree with it as quoted.  That kind of expense transfer applies across other sectors like Ag or transport where consumer costs will go up, but I don’t see it in oil and gas where it will simply depress investment.
3698 2018-01-03 16:52:16 So the price of oil is the fault of the NDP? Sorry, that dog don’t bark.

3701 2018-01-03 16:52:06 Read the article they are buying oil properties not oil to use. Same as Russians buying uranium assets from Canada
3702 2018-01-03 16:52:03 amoy siomai yung shark oil 
3703 2018-01-03 16:51:59 You’re correct. But, like always, price changes sentiment and I see many pros (not Twitter) going long Oil here. Silly.
3704 2018-01-03 16:51:56 The 2014 report that still relied on oil revenue?
3705 2018-01-03 16:51:54 Scarcity and black markets exist for one and only one reason - market manipulations.

Until we come to the realization that we don’t produce enough oil to subsidize petrol, we will continue to struggle to pay salaries, build roads, equip health centers and be a respectable govt..
3706 2018-01-03 16:51:53 People say I will be xyz in next 5 years and yyy is my dream. But the real question is, Are you ready to burn your midnight oil to achieve your goals which bring your dream come true? #Dreamers #Achievers #MKSquotes #MKS
3707 2018-01-03 16:51:49 GLOBAL WARMING... WE’RE ALMOST OUT OF OIL.... POLAR BEARS ARE DYING, INDONESIA IS DROWNING......
3708 2018-01-03 16:51:39 Loving my personal essential oil diffuser from @myMONQ! 
3709 2018-01-03 16:51:37 Mixing a Tom Ford and Arabian Musk oil is damn good stuff.
3710 2018-01-03 16:51:33 I love tf outta Ulta lip oil
3711 2018-01-03 16:51:32 Some basil, tomato and olive oil for a lovely caprese starter! 
3712 2018-01-03 16:51:28 why was my oil change just $84. 

I AM CRYING 
3713 2018-01-03 16:51:22 Ok that made me laugh lol
3714 2018-01-03 16:51:20 The title of this opinion piece should be “Mediterranean diet only diet with sound scientific support to reduce risk of CVD.” None the evidence isolates olive oil in particular. We still don’t understand the mechanisms. Could be eating with family for all we know.
3715 2018-01-03 16:51:13 We've got some great options for Beard Oil and Utility Balm that really soothe  irritation and moisturize the skin + beard hairs, plus they smell great!
3716 2018-01-03 16:51:13 Perfect with a drizzle of olive oil..
3717 2018-01-03 16:51:06 Show me where they are buying our oil.

3719 2018-01-03 16:50:54 Do you think my religion is a threat to yours? Which religion are you advocating freedom for anyways?
3720 2018-01-03 16:50:49 No worries!..I think we may have exposed a good deal of nefariousness in Utah and oil sand extraction, can't help but think Stinky Zinke is involved 
3721 2018-01-03 16:50:49 Spoiler : the oil wasn't even the cause
3722 2018-01-03 16:50:43 See that's the issue I think. The paneer I get is not 100% milk,  even though it says it is. This is the one disadvantage in not living in/near a Punjabi/Asian populated area. Don't always get the best stuff. Yeah, oil was hot too, getting that right is so important.
3723 2018-01-03 16:50:43 普段でもこう、景気よく大盤振る舞い！って感じでスカッとしたいですね
ちょっと艦これのイベント時のBGMを聞いてたらテンション上がってきてしまいました
3724 2018-01-03 16:50:36 Where we live the heating oil trucks can’t get down our driveway it’s too steep so coal is our only option no way could we heat our house with propane tanks again they could never get a truck down here you have no clue where we live
3725 2018-01-03 16:50:27 Jamaican castor oil, tea tree oil, vitamin d oil, shea moisture castors oil hair mask, coconut oil, eco styler coconut oil gel
3726 2018-01-03 16:50:25 I want to know how policy has changed, is enforcement down, have directors changed ops and brought in all oil and coal guys, not intern tweets.
3727 2018-01-03 16:50:18 When a major part of it goes to the oil and gas sector to pay for emission reduction R&D
3728 2018-01-03 16:50:12 Nonsensical. Those who are bought and paid for by the oil industry support what TRUMP is doing. Nelson is fighting to stop drilling and save our shores.
3729 2018-01-03 16:50:12 Radish call me we need to set some healthy boundaries. You in an identity crisis - God’s oil on my life has that affect. Call me I’ll pray for you.
3730 2018-01-03 16:50:05 My favourite to make refried beans, a little chilli, garlic,  cumin,pinch of cinnamon & fresh coriander, mash and spread on corn tortillas with cheese then lightly fry for a delicious quesadilla
3731 2018-01-03 16:50:04 And the #AHA spin doctors promptly went to work on demonizing coconut oil and stoking fears of saturated fat . . . because stop heart disease isn't profitable for any of their industry partners. Now eat your soybean oil and shut up.

3733 2018-01-03 16:50:03 So you are okay with globs of tar on our white beaches?  You are okay with dead dolphins and sea turtles washing up on the beach covered in oil? That was our world after Deep Horizon it ruined our economy for three years. Do you live on the Gulf?
3734 2018-01-03 16:50:01 See if you can find some Styrian pumpkin seed oil then splash a bit on yop of a bowl of pumpkin soup. Oh my god it's amazing. I had it in Czech Republic and Austria, so in your neighbourhood. :)
3735 2018-01-03 16:49:57 Do you want a fully costed proposal for independence? I will give you this 5 minutes after you give me one for Brexit. Just a wee taster I would make the oil companies actually pay for taking our Oil rather than subsiding their lifting costs.
3736 2018-01-03 16:49:50 You know as well as I do the argument is a lot bigger than that.
Wait, please tell me you believe in secret oil fields and whisky export tax
3737 2018-01-03 16:49:45 I gotta get this oil leak fixed kuz it’s getting outta control. I gotta keep putting oil in my car like every 3 days

3746 2018-01-03 16:48:38 Vegetables, colored stuff, legume and then before it fully cooked i add macaroni and oatmeal for just 10 min. Then i add olive oil, olives and close my nose and eat!
Healthy stuff, supposedly! I can't cook so i thro things on top of each other and luckily it works! 
3747 2018-01-03 16:48:38 California: never known a place so full of people who are such suckers for the next snake oil scam. Just wait for the lawsuits once somebody falls ill or dies - as so many people in poverty already do worldwide from drinking "raw water"
3748 2018-01-03 16:48:29 For the oil companies it’s all about the reserves in the arctic circle: climate change is helping to make it accessible. Their short sighted greed comes at the expense of humanity’s existence.
3749 2018-01-03 16:48:23 Olive oil cholesterol, Cantu products, and miss Jackie’s multicultural curls.. I never dry my hair, I put these products in it while it’s soaking wet and let it air dry
3750 2018-01-03 16:48:16 No bombs? Now I know you are a troll, or mad. Do you have any concept of the amount of western bombs that fall every year on Muslim countries?. We bomb their children steal their oil , arm their Jihadists every day and you complain about bombs. You are out of touch with reality
3751 2018-01-03 16:48:11 I've tried hard to understand why these people are so hysterical over Trump and I just don't get it.

3754 2018-01-03 16:47:38 I bet there would be a drink that looks like oil, or perhaps antifreeze
3755 2018-01-03 16:47:32 Watch Petro as well. Venezuelan Oil currency
3756 2018-01-03 16:47:24 Extra virgin oil is not "made 24 after harvest". It refers to the quality of oil, specially to acidity.
3757 2018-01-03 16:47:23 Yes, allowing people to change engine oil every 3,000 miles is bad for auto business also.
3758 2018-01-03 16:47:17 He will say not but Kokatath Oil, "Mahinda Hora.. Mahinda Hora.."

3763 2018-01-03 16:46:50 Many have great relations with Israel. Countries voted no for a variety of reasons. It was "safe" to vote to keep the oil flowing. The Palestinians have brought most on themselves. Paying terrorist families monthly? Disgusting.
3764 2018-01-03 16:46:48 Canola oil. Vegetable oil or ghee would work. It just needs to burn hot.
3765 2018-01-03 16:46:42 Absolutely lies will be mixed with the truth.Keep oil in your lamp.Wear your armor so you know the difference.

3772 2018-01-03 16:45:49 $35 for an oil change  why .
3773 2018-01-03 16:45:46 jingoist / row over / a flurry of / tailwind / tailwind / covet oil and gas / revert back to /
3774 2018-01-03 16:45:44 My entire cube is filled with peppermint oil
3775 2018-01-03 16:45:44 The Russians were the last ones to ship them oil.
3776 2018-01-03 16:45:41 Don't worry, eventually all the oil just makes them waterproof.
3777 2018-01-03 16:45:33 Lol....
If it's that one, we've moved on from Vaseline...
We use anointing oil now
3778 2018-01-03 16:45:29 i keep getting faint scents of my oil and it makes me sick and angeyb
3779 2018-01-03 16:45:19 olive oilにも会いたい…
3780 2018-01-03 16:45:02 I want to post a grainy picture of me in my pj's because it looks like an oil painting
3781 2018-01-03 16:44:53 "And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn,..." ~Luke 10:34
3782 2018-01-03 16:44:51 Use more paper (if we replant trees) and charge consumers more for oil based packaging. $10 for each plastic grocery bag and you’ll see more cloth bags used by shoppers.
3783 2018-01-03 16:44:46 You know it's cold in Florida when anything containing coconut oil is suddenly rock solid. I have to vigorously apply my deodorant these days. #SnowInFlorida
3784 2018-01-03 16:44:30 Never ignore price action - great example #Gold #Oil
$CL_G $GC_F
Read the trend and read price action => you will be on the right side of the trade.

FYI #Oil is trading in the void to $63.00

3785 2018-01-03 16:44:27 Try Tea tree oil. It saved me. 
3786 2018-01-03 16:44:25 David Rockefeller funds the Sierra Club, who in turn protests the drilling of new oil wells. But David doesn't mind, he knows less oil wells, means higher gas prices! Supply and Demand works well, when you control the competition...
3787 2018-01-03 16:44:05 America could become oil king of the world in 2018
3788 2018-01-03 16:44:05 Sugar and olive oil is a good place to start. Mix and scrub on skin and rinse off
3789 2018-01-03 16:43:44 Coconut oil on my face preparing for this new day lmao
3790 2018-01-03 16:43:36 Maybe time to invest in oil again...
3791 2018-01-03 16:43:20 FACT- the body needs certain good "fats" daily such as olive oil, flaxseed, sunflower and canola. A couple teaspoons is okay.
3792 2018-01-03 16:43:17 Don't try my dry skin o. .
  Harmattan is not my Frd...
  Been using anointing oil since
3793 2018-01-03 16:43:12 "The whitest and grooviest things in the world cannot be cuddled or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
3794 2018-01-03 16:43:12 It’s indefensible, but I don’t even know who he is. Nor do I care.
3795 2018-01-03 16:43:00 Followed you
3796 2018-01-03 16:43:00 ...while simultaneously voting to deregulate oil&gas companies & strip away environmental protections. 

Finished that for ya.
3797 2018-01-03 16:42:51 Yep. Gas curtailment and pretty high LMP. All those CCGTs running on oil. Probably doubling emissions because of it.
3798 2018-01-03 16:42:48 Real:<b>pandeyboxer119</b>(2P)770 was spotted at Indian Oil travelling towards <Select>
3799 2018-01-03 16:42:35 Another “conventional” move would be a US naval blockade. Nations generally consider that a provocation toward war. Recent seizure of the oil tankers gets the effect of a blockade without an actual provocative blockade
3800 2018-01-03 16:42:35 @oloumaldar Please ask HH Sheikh @HHShkMohd to pay for 40 oil paintings as I was requested by HH companian Anita to take her picture to paint a portrait in front of a dozen, but HH presumed I had filmed to blackmail but instead I was blackmailed by his father-in-law & officials!
3801 2018-01-03 16:42:27 They have been drilling all over the ocean for decades, could actually help  Florida economy and get more industry, more good jobs, you complain stop using fossil fuels and products made by and with fossil fuels before you speak up, show us we don't need oil, go live off the grid
3802 2018-01-03 16:42:22 ネムがネムしてる！！！
3803 2018-01-03 16:42:18 Så det nå, long i oil.
3804 2018-01-03 16:42:07 Which the Scottish Govt would have done themselves had they had overall control of the tax revenue from the oil industry and production.
3805 2018-01-03 16:42:06 Supposed to get this oil change today.& I'm like fuck it .. wait til Friday. Ion feel like waiting on my car.
3806 2018-01-03 16:42:01 *Crude oil price soared near 12 month high as rising geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran*
3807 2018-01-03 16:41:58 i hate getting my oil changed so much i've been putting it off but i NEED to and im absolutely dreading it like i'd rather do ANYTHING ELSE
3808 2018-01-03 16:41:46 My CBD oil arrived today! So excited to give this stuff a shot. I'm so done with consuming a tonne of shitty man made chemical prescriptions. Fingers crossed for positive results 
3809 2018-01-03 16:41:40 Hardly slept a wink last night because of the bloody storm. Felt like I was sleeping outside at times. Shout to my homie @saucynads who’s on an oil rig in the North Sea just now 
3810 2018-01-03 16:41:38 $Zn Zion Oil and Gas, you are just referencing pre revenue or do they have a leg in the weed game ?
3811 2018-01-03 16:41:20 Peter there disgrace to human society @PeterDutton_MP ex copper look good in black jackboots @MikeCarlton01 other ideas @TurnbullMalcolm he’s dead in oil going after @DanielAndrewsMP when his own mate eats with undesirables fact I’ve dared him go there he won’t QLD vote him out
3812 2018-01-03 16:41:05 the uncertainty in the middle east is making it a bit easier to predict oil.
3813 2018-01-03 16:40:52 @PutinRF_Eng Hi Vladimir. Can you do us another little favor to push Donald the rest of the way out of office? Our GOP refuses to impeach him. The world really just want to stop drilling Oil and move on to Solar-- can you & @HillaryClinton shake hands and work together now? 
3814 2018-01-03 16:40:45 It’s a oil to use
3815 2018-01-03 16:40:36 Oil workers are important, just ask the people in the movie Armageddon! #sci9
3816 2018-01-03 16:40:35 @ChuckPol OK here's a tip 4 cleaning tack. I saw u cleaning the beautiful driving harness w/Dawn & I cringed. Pls use Murphy's Oil Soap w/warm water. Makes ur tack yummy!
3817 2018-01-03 16:40:33 Subc7, gamig, pgs, nas og long oil
3818 2018-01-03 16:40:33 You goddamn right, I did. That oil is clutch. Left the brush at home by accident
3819 2018-01-03 16:40:32 @carrieunderwood, my heart goes out to you as I heard about your accident. I know you're working w/ wonderful doctors, but something that helped me after I was cleared to use on my incision scar was castor oil infused w/comfrey. Research & do what feels comfortable. Blessings 2U
3820 2018-01-03 16:40:30 Lessons learned: a tiny bit of coconut oil in coffee is divine.
3821 2018-01-03 16:40:17 This Terrorist called UAE is the cause of Somalia's instability because of  the immense oil deposit in all the 8 regions of Somalia.UN shd punish UAE with economic sanctns n make them responsible for the 1000 plus people that die every month in the hands of Terrorist in Somalia .
3822 2018-01-03 16:40:14 Just filled the tank in my car this morning, checked oil, wiped windshield. Nearly died. Bring back Full Serve pls. 
#oregongas
3823 2018-01-03 16:40:08 Endless oil story
3824 2018-01-03 16:39:33 It seems to me that, contrary to public opinion, the BP oil spill was the best thing that has ever happened to the Gulf coast.
3825 2018-01-03 16:39:24 Nothing has been voucher aid or crime victim and in Capital Crimes Farm OAG Oil USDOT
3826 2018-01-03 16:39:18 I couldn’t agree more. If we would withdraw all financial aid from the Middle East & lead a world wide embargo of their oil, very soon, they would be fighting with sticks & stones.
3827 2018-01-03 16:39:07 Holding onto stocks and watching the stock markets - Dow, oil, & S&P going strong today. You?
3828 2018-01-03 16:39:06 I like adding some coconut or Moroccan oil while my hair is wet. A little goes a loooog way. Then blow-dry and somehow it works better!
3829 2018-01-03 16:38:58 actually I find he insults women regularly by claiming to be a feminist and supporting female suppression of Islam and Saudi oil, (to mention only 2 of his examples of NOT A FEMINIST) #TRUDEAUMUSTGO
3830 2018-01-03 16:38:52 Oil pulling is great for your teeth!
3831 2018-01-03 16:38:41 @ShropCouncil The oil spill on Portland Crescent is also on Belvidere Road and Preston Street and on the pavements. The hairpin bend at the top of Preston St. is lethal. This was reported at 4 by me but earlier by others. Needs urgent attention.
3832 2018-01-03 16:38:41 You can take CBD oil for pain and not be high.  I'd be more afraid of some of the anti-depressants shill doctors at the VA are putting veterans on and going to work with.
3833 2018-01-03 16:38:40 I knew I preferred olive oil for a reason
3834 2018-01-03 16:38:37 Win what the heck you don’t use oil in windmills
3835 2018-01-03 16:38:31 Ohhh... I get it.  Anti-pakistan, anti-iran... You're trying to jack up oil prices for Putin aren't you?  Maybe get in a nuclear war to boost your approval? Have you implemented the russian sanctions passed by congress yet or have you been too busy attacking the free press?
3836 2018-01-03 16:38:28 Yeah but you could probably run a couple hundred cars for a few months with all that valuable oil under that ground o’er there. I say frack the shit out of it. Wouldn’t that picture look better with a few of those cool oil rig pecker things poking the ground?
3837 2018-01-03 16:38:04 Car question: my oil light keeps coming on for 2 days, I've added oil but still comes on, could it need antifreeze instead?
3838 2018-01-03 16:37:42 Essential oil game on point; I GUARANTEE
3839 2018-01-03 16:37:31 I started trading MTF exclusively soon after closing out oil short after my short experience with Bayes.  My experience with MTF right now is around 88% success rate in my trades.  I had once thought it impossible to exceed 70, especially when I'm in 30 positions any given time.
3840 2018-01-03 16:37:17 I understand. When I first started driving their was a gas station that pumped the gas, checked the oil and cleaned the windshield; I loved it! But, I didn't have a hissy fit when I had to pump my own gas.
3841 2018-01-03 16:37:16 I’m never covering my skin in coconut oil on holiday again. 
I went on holiday in September, it’s now January, the tan is still here.
3842 2018-01-03 16:37:13 And what will happen with my trades? Trading oil atm and I do not have any access to my acc.
3843 2018-01-03 16:37:06 I'm pretty sure Jesus doesn't say threaten Kim with nuclear death or drill pur lands for oil and gas either or harass a woman using Jesus and royalty as excuse
3844 2018-01-03 16:37:06 Today's "No I promise I'm alive" look is brought to you by mascara, lip oil, highlighter, and brow products.
3845 2018-01-03 16:37:04 Coconut oil is life 
3846 2018-01-03 16:37:01 Why is argan oil so expensive 
3847 2018-01-03 16:36:54 which oil use in your food
3848 2018-01-03 16:36:47 @TheShannonBurke If I find out I have cancer imma drink a bottle of tea tree oil. It cures everything I've used it for so far!
3849 2018-01-03 16:36:47 Well ya oil pollutes but the question is what is what is the energy we should be using NOW, not 100 years from now    #sci9
3850 2018-01-03 16:36:44 A handout? Well, how about they give us nothing, and we keep the Oil, Whisky, fishing and agriculture receipts,,,,,, watch England go slowly grey as it withers......
3851 2018-01-03 16:36:24 Must have seen this stat retweeted 20 X the last 3 days,  which tells me twitter hates this oil rally.    Short term anything can happen.  Longer term its the hedgers who are wrong.  JMO............................................
3852 2018-01-03 16:36:11 Support by making sure they have external investment for jobs or are you hoping to sell them weapons and have their oil?

3855 2018-01-03 16:35:42 OMG, we make one from scratch at home, using Avocado Oil, pastured eggs, ACV and some balsamic vinegar. I simply don't touch it anymore, because I dont stop. I make it for husband and kids and leave strictly alone.
3856 2018-01-03 16:35:38 Oil debate! Friends vs. Friends, will this get cutthroat? #sci9
3857 2018-01-03 16:35:33 linked artle is slightly misleading re: oil consumption. It was added to the diet, but the amount consumed wasn't measured (just resulting body weight gain). There is no way to know how much canola oil was eaten, just that they ate some, & overall ate more calories than controls.
3858 2018-01-03 16:35:26 Kobe’s brother?
3859 2018-01-03 16:35:24 That is nothing - we woke up this morning to an empty fuel oil tank and the house was 55 F. Outside was 12 F.  Got you beat!
3860 2018-01-03 16:35:24 If criminals want to use suppressors, they can make them out of oil filters. This regulation stops nothing.
3861 2018-01-03 16:35:10 The benefactors being the oil industry Start with Rockefeller empire
Thanks
3862 2018-01-03 16:34:58 nearly all my Oil & Gas watch list is up.... #ENQ in double figures,
  #SQZ  down
3863 2018-01-03 16:34:54 Enjoyed your commentary, particularly the oil wild card. Possibly a late cycle bump in commodities generally?
3864 2018-01-03 16:34:27 US is watching fpr any signs of oil and freedom .terrorists in suits!
3865 2018-01-03 16:34:26 Really?? Oil is a finite source?? I had no idea what a revelation! #sci9
3866 2018-01-03 16:34:23 I just looked at your pregnancy update video.  I had PUPPS with my 3rd pregnancy (the only boy). It was awful!  I’m so glad you got through it.  Tea tree oil helped me a lot, but hopefully you won’t need it.
3867 2018-01-03 16:34:19 Meaning we earn enough FX from crude oil sales and our only issue is the monetary system? This is wishful thinking considering we are not Saudi Arabia. Even Saudi Arabia has had to increase petrol prices by 127% recently.
3868 2018-01-03 16:34:17 Aw great stuff. If he does get a bit of arthritis later on one tea spoon of cod liver oil a day will help
3869 2018-01-03 16:34:16 What you plan on invading and "liberating them" like we liberated Iraq?? Oh and take their oil as a "payment" when they involuntarily wanted the help?? Man you sounding like one of the Bush family lol
3870 2018-01-03 16:34:15 This is worst Govt in Nigeria since independence a Govt full of liars and sycophants......how can we be producing oil and still buy it so expensive it a pity ......only God will save us from APC
3871 2018-01-03 16:34:12 Burn midnight oil??
3872 2018-01-03 16:34:02 2#
The money which you talking about is our own money which better to tell people about the story of that. 

After the revolution and cutting the valve of oil to your interest , you block all our overseas funds and you bet on that?
3873 2018-01-03 16:33:49 Exactly...as long as the anaemia os die to iron deficiency, calcium WITH vit D, fish oil? Not sure would need to look into it...but you probably know mor than me on about it!
3874 2018-01-03 16:33:48 BINGO. Switch hit Mitt is still swinging away and selling snake oil to whatever voter will buy it.
3875 2018-01-03 16:33:44 Another pair of pants relegated to dirty tasks due to me failing to anticipate how messy a job was going to be and staining them with engine oil.
3876 2018-01-03 16:33:31 Coconut oil mask after dying. Just rub it all in your hair, wrap it, sleep, rinse and wash in the am. Repeat as needed :)
3877 2018-01-03 16:33:23 Used apple cider vinegar, epsom salt, baking soda,honey & coconut oil for my detox bath. My body feels amazing & my skin feels like a newborns 
3878 2018-01-03 16:33:19 They are so selfish.We need to stand up for these animals.These oil people don't care.We need to protect our elderly.Most have paid their dues, Now they are getting ripped off.Not right.
3879 2018-01-03 16:33:18 Olive oil dimuka, lip blam dibibir (yaiyalah ogeb), vaselin di badan. Ok tidur. Slamat memejam.
3880 2018-01-03 16:33:18 This is off subject but I wanted you to check into the symbolism of the chevron oil co. I was researching fracking and stumbled upon Templars 
Symbol ... do you know about this?
3881 2018-01-03 16:33:11 olive oil is an international treasure
3882 2018-01-03 16:33:09 Oil prices about to drop off a cliff and oil-producing countries are going to be devastated.

3887 2018-01-03 16:32:39 When people (such as Toby Young) talk about "intellectual diversity", all I imagine is a gaggle of white men sat around a table going

"Look! We're -so- diverse! I'm a Tory and he's a centrist! He's the CEO of a Pharmaceutical Co and him over there's into Oil!"

3890 2018-01-03 16:32:23 Sigh!  The oil belongs to the oil companies. The UK only gets the tax and that is reduced because the SNP asked the Treasury to help the ailing oil industry.  Why don't you do some research
3891 2018-01-03 16:32:19 Castor oil
3892 2018-01-03 16:32:15 There are reports of an oil spillage in the Melmount Road, Strabane and Beltany Road, Omagh. 

Drivers should exercise caution in both areas.
3893 2018-01-03 16:32:00 We don't need another Bush, Obama or Romney.  We need to move on from these agenda driven people. Bush is for big Oil, Obama is for big socialized Government and Romney has a need to show America that there is more to him than just inheriting alot of money ! TRUMPS FOR AMERICA !
3894 2018-01-03 16:31:44 Could have saved >500 calories by not adding so much oil to the roasted veg and shrimp... and dressing.... just saying
3895 2018-01-03 16:31:42 Girl I braid my hair down and leave it alone. I wear wigs all the time too. I also take 5000mcg of biotin. Every 2 weeks I take my hair down, wash and deep condition and see so much new growth. That oil does wonders!
3896 2018-01-03 16:31:39 I put too much baby oil on my boobs. 
3897 2018-01-03 16:31:36 If Renewables got the same pre and post-tax breaks/credits that oil,gas,and coal does; it would be an entirely different story.     Solar is solved it’s just resistance to change, especially from government, b/c that power can’t be taxed. They are stuck on the old model.
3898 2018-01-03 16:31:29 Kim, Happy new year and oil fresh

3901 2018-01-03 16:30:58 Crude oil reaches new 2-1/2 year highs. CRB is at 2-year high. Continuous Commodity Index at 10-month high. Dollar firmer today, but trending lower. Corn stdy, beans up 2, wheat up 1, KC up 4, MN up 3 #OATT
3902 2018-01-03 16:30:47 2,80€ on my Steam wallet. The collectibles keep on raking cash! I feel like an oil baron.

3904 2018-01-03 16:30:38 OIL DIFF: 6.39 -> 6.43
3905 2018-01-03 16:30:35 Peppermint oil or soap
3906 2018-01-03 16:30:32 Lo ideal para el país sería que se dé la reducción de costos (cambio de fuel oil por pekoke de petróleo, principal inversión con los bonos) para conseguir una reducción del precio de cemento y también un ajuste de salarios.
3907 2018-01-03 16:30:32 Simple oil of cloves...
3908 2018-01-03 16:30:20 Maybe later lol I'm changing my oil and they behind
3909 2018-01-03 16:30:19 en gros la meuf est belle donc c'est une oeuvre d'art donc ils mettent oil on canvas comme si ct une oeuvre crée par Dieu
3910 2018-01-03 16:30:05 Ohhh, I have both and never thought to mix them. About to oil my scalp with both now. What also helps me is spraying my hair with water daily or every other day, then moisturize with a good leave-in conditioner and seal it in with oil
3911 2018-01-03 16:30:04 I liked the Dr. Strange movie, but its reliance on the rhetoric of the holistic snake oil community that regularly endangers its consumer base was both disturbing and inelegant storytelling. The "expand your mind, man" trope is not interesting.
3912 2018-01-03 16:29:57 It depends on the cleanser, I usually use a powder mixture to polish (tacha rice powder) after an oil cleanser and I’ll usually use a deep clean mask when I’m in the shower because the steam opens my pores more

3921 2018-01-03 16:29:15 When life holds out an olive branch, make olive oil.

3923 2018-01-03 16:29:10 @O2 now approaching 2hrs on hold,  already carried out an oil change on the car and school run, now gonna start cooking meal, not really helping your customer retention team! #customerservicefail
3924 2018-01-03 16:29:10 You'd probably have to go with something oil based, but it looks like the preferred natural oil (coconut) starts becoming solid below 76F sooooo... maybe not that one.

3926 2018-01-03 16:29:05 I love how trump supporters refuse and discredit any opinion that differs from theirs. Guess they don’t love democracy too much. Btw, oil just went over $61 per barrel. Thanks trump. Not his fault but if he wants credit for the economy....

3933 2018-01-03 16:28:36 Good day, Mr. @Dolarpo Oni, a quick question if you have the time. What are your thoughts concerning the viability of FG's insistence to not increase fuel prices, in light of global oil price increases. Also, see SArabia's latest decision. Is it sensible/defensible? Thanks

3963 2018-01-03 16:26:17 You've done a great job making sire Obama's accomplishments have been eradicated and made it to where the corporations benefit more than the people who keep this country running. Not to mention making it legal for gas and oil companies to destroy and pollute our country. Good Job

4004 2018-01-03 16:20:46 Thank you, Ms. Clinton! As an Iranian American who campaigned with you previously, I think negotiations to separate powers and give more weight to Russia for oil and activity in Syria, alongside lesser sanctions imposed can actually be a blessing in disguise!

4060 2018-01-03 16:13:59 Very limited supply of attention more valuable than oil attention equal to a miracle  drug just like Ozzy sings about 
4061 2018-01-03 16:13:56 Please stop with the scare tactics. All of Florida’s oil comes here by ship. There have been more mishaps and oil spillage due to ships colliding. Florida citizens need to tap our natural resources.
4062 2018-01-03 16:13:35 Some of the contents of my purse right now: two sandwiches, two scarves, a bag of nuts, a flask full of vodka inside a smaller purse, many different kinds of tampons and lipsticks, a vial if coconut oil, and one shoe

We should be good here. If power goes out we have a whole house generator that automatically kicks in. Just got oil and propane deliveries, so I think we're good to go. Just got to hit the bank, no cash on hand.

Highlight large black areas with eshin grey

4133 2018-01-03 16:04:17 Greece's has neither the world's reserve currency, nor a 43-year old monopoly on the pricing of oil/commodities.  Which means unless the world ends the USD's monopoly in global oil trade, the US will hyperinflate the price of oil & crash the global econ to pay this debt.

4154 2018-01-03 16:02:16 That is true. I don’t know the rules. Am I only allowed to reply to all of you? I agree that the only way we are going to fix this country is somehow to band together. Most don’t realize that thanks to Obama the freedoms of many are possibly in peril.
4155 2018-01-03 16:02:07 Most states started pumping their own gas back during the Middle East Oil Crisis during the Carter administration in the late 70’s. So it’s been awhile.

4166 2018-01-03 16:01:29 The Conservatives brought in the #GST which made home heating more expensive. Get honest about taxes. You already had high gas/oil/electrical  taxes! Calling Liberals arrogant is displacing the truth.

4196 2018-01-03 15:57:59 If I’m not mistaken, there was a metallurgist from Kansas who hired an independent Swiss geologist who also said that there would be no oil found in KSA. He nonetheless began drilling an exploratory well. I don’t remember the whole story but I was reminded of it.

4213 2018-01-03 15:56:09 The reference picture is almost black. Try another Nuln Oil wash but add a bit of Abaddon Black for a darker wash. Especially in the recesses. Good luck! 
4214 2018-01-03 15:56:08 Cannabis oil has huge benefits in the treatment of several ailments. 

Yes, you’re absolutely right. There’re plenty of cloud-headed people out there who aren’t aware of this.

4251 2018-01-03 15:52:27 They should pay us back for the blood and money spent there but we really don’t need their oil. Fracking has essentially made us independent of foreign oil. If we keep having to prop Iraq up and save their butts, paying us with oil would seem logical.

4350 2018-01-03 15:41:38 Coconut oil! It’s my go-to
4351 2018-01-03 15:41:26 Love coconut to eat, cook with the oil, use it on my hair and skin, wonderful!
4352 2018-01-03 15:41:12 He told me Monday he was worried about his oil freezing and I told my mama about it..not thinking he would try to rig up a way to make sure it didn't freeze
4353 2018-01-03 15:41:06 I'm just trying to get my oil changed and this old ass man won't leave me alone
4354 2018-01-03 15:40:56 tryna take a roadtrip so long I gotta change my oil halfway through
4355 2018-01-03 15:40:55 Naini tapi kalo gak salah belinya harus kiloan. Buat apa cobak essential oil sekilo. 
4356 2018-01-03 15:40:53 Its about time to get my ready for another midnight oil session.
4357 2018-01-03 15:40:48 Hoy el USD Index rebota (+0,37%) y sin embargo, el crude oil sube también (+1,7%) y el oro práticamente no se mueve (-0,07%). Lo habitual es que ambas tengan correlación negativa con el USD. Lo interpreto como síntoma de fortaleza en ambas commodities.
4358 2018-01-03 15:40:44 Dear Sir, Brent Oil @ 67.55....its up 1.47%....Banking stocks will feel the heat?
4359 2018-01-03 15:40:38 Girl we turning everything into oil and seeing where it applies a glow is a glow all 2018k  jk but seriously it is amazing for skin too and shrinks my pores!
4360 2018-01-03 15:40:32 Why not Bomb VBIED warehouses and #Alshabab Bases in Well known places like Jamame,? Why only Lower Shabelle? It is for .... Oil Reserve area of Korioley & Afgoye?
4361 2018-01-03 15:40:26 Not even holy oil can moisturize her lmaoo
4362 2018-01-03 15:40:23 フラン姐さんに殴られたなう
4363 2018-01-03 15:40:22 え？まさか
4364 2018-01-03 15:40:17 Norway has a Sovereign Wealth Fund of $1 Trillion from oil and gas revenues. Trudeau?
4365 2018-01-03 15:40:09 Use beard wax or oils, especially argan or karité oil and comb it gently or apply it with your hands and let it be absorbed... it always works!!! 
4366 2018-01-03 15:40:09 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
4367 2018-01-03 15:39:47 Oil of oregano! On it

4371 2018-01-03 15:39:16 $WTIC oil 61.40, 2.5 year high
4372 2018-01-03 15:39:06 Federal Gov can order pipeline built without approval of any province! Get of their butts and build it to eastern Canada and one to the west. Stop giving our oil and jobs away to the US for far less than market value. Stop the line to US build Canadian for us!
4373 2018-01-03 15:38:58 Lil Oil Filter
4374 2018-01-03 15:38:47 The next gen will have such cheap 3D printers custom terrain will be easy... Us old guys can keep our oil washed coffee tins in care home :)
4375 2018-01-03 15:38:37 Oil of Oregano. Drops under the tongue. Steam room at the hotel or find one ASAP!
4376 2018-01-03 15:38:29 This gif is one of the goat chappelle clips. "Oil? Who said something bout oil bitch you cooking?"
4377 2018-01-03 15:38:27 Exercise. Vulnerability. Tea. Essential oil cleanse. Dog masturbation. Fecal doping. Canine decal doping.
4378 2018-01-03 15:38:16 Girl I take my booty blender and dab it in my setting powder. I go along the pores on my nose and my cheeks. It literally fills (not clogs) your pores, so when you put foundation on it just glides over and pores are nonexistent. It helps control oil too!!
4379 2018-01-03 15:38:10 hahahahaha kainis! Ang benta ng salonpas! Hahaha Efficascent Oil na lang para.... Wala lang! Haha

4380 2018-01-03 15:38:01 Our IT team's burning the midnight oil to get things back on track. Rest assured, we hear ya on this. ^AJS
4381 2018-01-03 15:37:42 La caida de la MUD se debe a causas mas profundas. La elite politica venezolana esta sometida a las compañias petroleras y Maduro es portavoz de los intereses petroleros a nivel mundial. Recorta produccion para que el oil cartel mantenga ganancias. Falta conciencia.
4382 2018-01-03 15:37:42 It started in Naples - Clark Gable and Sophia Loren, made in 1960.
Quote from an Italian on a balcony, to Gable: 
'Why don't you get out of the Middle East? Oil oil oil.'

#NothingChanges
4383 2018-01-03 15:37:41 Of course, that's the worry for everyone. But with an influx of 900 million (for example) into alternative energy, think of all the new jobs! Rather than an another 900 million to oil companies already sitting on (not helping) 92 billion in profit. They just try to scare us.
4384 2018-01-03 15:37:40 Still bullish... who want another war in the Middle East? Bush Iraq war was a disaster that killed over 500,000 people and hundreds of wounded veterans. Who want a war that will accomplish nothing. We need to move to clean energy like solar and wind. Forget about the coal & oil
4385 2018-01-03 15:37:40 Health tip for the day: A cornerstone of the Mediterranean Diet is daily use of extra virgin olive oil, rich in beneficial fatty acids, vitamins, & polyphenols. A key anti-inflammatory food, it prevents conditions linked to chronic inflammation, such as cancer & heart disease.
4386 2018-01-03 15:37:25 @chukaobi mehn...ur writing as landed you a seat amongst greats like Ser Shakespeare and dicken.I cant wait for part 4. Thanks for given us the summary of modern Nigeria with homour.  Pls  dont forget Princess  Alison of House Madueke, the forner keeper of oil, mother of thieves.
4387 2018-01-03 15:37:20 And yet someone I spoke to yesterday was blaming Brexit for the price of heating oil rising.With ignorance like that how can Brexit ever win.I dispair.
4388 2018-01-03 15:37:14 つらすぎてあと1時間は風呂入れるわ…
4389 2018-01-03 15:37:13 They are good at selling snake oil?
4390 2018-01-03 15:37:12 Will's going to need armed guards, lol.
4391 2018-01-03 15:37:11 Oil up ... stocks up ... cryptos up ... metals up ... gold up ...

And bonds are up, too.

Something is rotten in the state of Denmark
4392 2018-01-03 15:37:06 I'm well aware of drug trafficking, world markets, oil prices, political narratives but I am also aware of all the issues that face CA & USA-we have been focusing on helping all the other children of the world over our very own and that is just bad policy that leads to demise!

4394 2018-01-03 15:36:54 do people still pinch their cheeks to add color to their face? and olive oil will make your eyelashes longer and thicker and darker if you're patient for like a couple weeks ^^
4395 2018-01-03 15:36:39 @mccmc3 
Happy New Year. Pl redress some small issues of RadhakrushnaVihar,Sector 6,CDA we r requesting since one year
1. Construct small patch of inner road left 2. Arrange spray of mosquito oil as we r adjacent to Petanal
3. Provide proper lighting
4396 2018-01-03 15:36:38 Wisdom is water. Ego is oil. They don't mix.
4397 2018-01-03 15:36:37 Arsenal vs Chelsea tonight

Not sure who I despise more, a club who ruined football in England & have no history until the oil baron arrived

Or a club with the worst fans in history with one of the greatest managers to manage in the premier league

I hope Hazard and Sanchez go

4400 2018-01-03 15:36:13 When the Troglodytes of #Iran deliver 10,000 super tankers of FREE oil #GullibleAmerica does NOT need to be involved with that backwards #Muslim Nation. 

Just sit back and watch the savages kill each other. 
#RememberDesertOne
4401 2018-01-03 15:36:12 Iran was a very forward and beautiful country before America did its 1953 regime change effort to get their oil. After years of sanctions to topple their sovereignty, they are worse off. CIA inspired uprisings always hurt. Will be worse yet if we bomb them with freedom.
4402 2018-01-03 15:36:07 Have u tried fried plantain, mixed with garri, fried using palm oil.... This is not a joke

4408 2018-01-03 15:35:18 IAM LONG OIL, 65.00, TARGET IS 80-100
4409 2018-01-03 15:35:11 $100 Billion is your budget to rebuild iraq for the next 10 years??? Iraq makes 130 billion a year just from oil. And you want to give the country only 10% of that?? What you planing to do when the other 90%??
4410 2018-01-03 15:35:11 @realDonaldTrump Sir, why are oil prices so high and getting higher? This will NOT #MAGA
4411 2018-01-03 15:34:46 Dlamini and accountability are like water and oil,and it's not only her the rest know themselves.
4412 2018-01-03 15:34:37 That's why most office break rooms keep a motor oil dipstick next to the pot of sludge.
4413 2018-01-03 15:34:33 Only in Alberta.....where oil is born.
4414 2018-01-03 15:34:21 
4415 2018-01-03 15:34:18 Need my oil changed.. gone do that Saturday since I’m off.

3=  XOM, gas and oil production

Lets have a great start with these great picks.Stay Strong
4419 2018-01-03 15:33:57 Can i ask? Why is the term "fried" used when you aren't using any oil and heat to fry it? Genuinely curious.
4420 2018-01-03 15:33:50 @rawazinbookshop الإخوة في روازن ، هل يوجد معكم كتاب The oil and the glory ؟
4421 2018-01-03 15:33:46 Why are oil prices so high and getting higher? This will NOT #MAGA
4422 2018-01-03 15:33:37 The oil industry in #Canada struggles while the country continues to buy foreign oil from dictatorships. Go figure.
4423 2018-01-03 15:33:37 Oil has definitely spanked me before. That is a perfect way to describe how oil behaves. Size is everything. I had to get spanked myself to respect that. Even now when it tests a side I go into combat mode.
4424 2018-01-03 15:33:37 He is retiring because he is old, he voted yes to tax scam 101, backed shrinking two parks for oil which is sadistic and greedy.
4425 2018-01-03 15:33:32 Bruce Lee once said that every time The Donald complains, a member of congress dreams about being a #Democrat
4426 2018-01-03 15:33:32 A smoothing facial mask, sultry indigo, with grapeskin, ylang ylang oil, and exfoliating brown sugar. It comes as a free-flowing liquid.
4427 2018-01-03 15:33:32 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
4428 2018-01-03 15:33:32 you aint from idaho if you dont put your donuts with olive oil
4429 2018-01-03 15:33:32 1am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Pittsburgh sleeps.
4430 2018-01-03 15:33:32 The mystical oil companies have a church where they're oppressing sheeple. They want to replace congress with crisis actors.
4431 2018-01-03 15:33:31 I feel like the Tin-Man before getting the oil
4432 2018-01-03 15:33:26 That's the one. The one where oil prices are worth 8bn a year but as of last year had a huge deficit. The one where oil was just a bonus but actually turns out it was dependent on oil.
4433 2018-01-03 15:33:16 He’s just looking for an opportunity to steal their oil.
4434 2018-01-03 15:32:57 So you need to steel oil from another country again
4435 2018-01-03 15:32:54 DOES IT MATTER, DONT OIL UP THE FLOOR
4436 2018-01-03 15:32:47 You are 1. impliciting making a curve call 2. maybe misunderstand how the leveraging works, UCO would be great if it grinds high in a straight line if it chops then pops UCO==BAD.  Oil etfs are horrendous, use futs to make a call.
4437 2018-01-03 15:32:25 Hey Scott you missed me!  Followed, hope you’ll follow back!#MAGA 
4438 2018-01-03 15:32:23 Oil rose to its highest level since 2015 on Tuesday, climbing to an intraday high above $67 a barrel as hedge funds placed a record bet that Brent crude’s near 35% rally over the past six months will continue into the new year, with protests in Iran stoking buying.
4439 2018-01-03 15:32:21 The more reason we need a standard and modern MONETARY SYSTEM whereby the dynamics created would mean the more FX we earn (if Crude Oil prices or our production increases) the stronger the FX Exchange gets. Thus whether petrol remains our largest import item or we refine locally

4443 2018-01-03 15:32:00 The oil chowed my hairline
4444 2018-01-03 15:31:52 @CurePSP I have a friend who was just diagnosed yesterday with PSP. Is there any possibility that a ketogenic diet , and/ or coconut/MCT oil  or high dose fish oil might be beneficial to these patients as they are in Alzheimer’s Disease?
4445 2018-01-03 15:31:51 While thieving Scotland's oil revenues.
4446 2018-01-03 15:31:48 So I reject the "soak the blue states" framing. Illinois and Texas have Republican governors. In Canada the analogous issue (equalization payments) has the exact reverse tribal valence, since conservative Alberta's oil wealth gives much higher fiscal capacity.
4447 2018-01-03 15:31:42 Winston...with all due respect...the increase in gas at the pump was far more than the carbon tax increase...did i miss your angry tweet about the big oil companies who hike the price of gas on hard working Canadians just trying to get to work?
4448 2018-01-03 15:31:35 Oil Turtle

4452 2018-01-03 15:31:03 Or you could have a dream about drowning in oil!
4453 2018-01-03 15:31:01 when does the market decide that $BHGE is an oil service co and not to be sold with $GE? ever? asking for a friend (ok asking for myself)
4454 2018-01-03 15:31:00 Your just using reality to undermine the facts. If drinking 10,000 calories worth of canola oil every day has adverse health consequences, it's important to get the word out.
4455 2018-01-03 15:30:59 Don't let your hair get into your face while you sleep. The oil from your hair can cause acne.
4456 2018-01-03 15:30:54 يمديك ترجعهم اذا ماقطيت الفاتوره 
4457 2018-01-03 15:30:53 I been at Mobil for an hour waiting for this oil change. I've def thought about walking home and leaving the entire car here. I just wanna go home and lay down .
4458 2018-01-03 15:30:50 Is the #IranProtest just another excuse for jacking up oil prices which means we pay more at the pump? 

It’s looking that way.
4459 2018-01-03 15:30:47 I don’t. I hope the owners had a oil shortage and sell you to a united fan for £1 who drives you back down to division 2 
4460 2018-01-03 15:30:46 LMAO hey it is just a state trying to find employment opportunities for former Weed Peddlers, now that they have been put out of business by legalization. It might also be noted they actual wash your windows & check tires /oil/coolant levels. 
4461 2018-01-03 15:30:45 All products containing palm oil to be listed as 'sustainable palm oil' on packaging, or better still don't include it as an ingredient

4467 2018-01-03 15:30:13 OIL DIFF: 6.46 -> 6.48
4468 2018-01-03 15:30:12 No... Two reasons. The so called new normal and shift to services will put upward pressure on oil. I imagine the scale of EVs is still too small, but I have not looked at numbers. China is big...
4469 2018-01-03 15:30:11 Almond oil is a blessing.
4470 2018-01-03 15:30:03 Monounsaturated fats are healthy fats. Olive and hemp oil and avocados are forms of monounsaturated fats.
4471 2018-01-03 15:29:58 なにそれかわいい…
4472 2018-01-03 15:29:45 I don't buy into that whole "coconut oil is healthier" craze. A lipid is a lipid. It still burns at 9 cals/gram and it's more dense so people often use more of it than they would use olive oil
4473 2018-01-03 15:29:38 なんか、赤ちゃんゾンビを世話するやつ思いだしたよ。真面目な人だから、噛まれそうになりながらミルクやろうとしたり、公園にベビーカーで散歩にいったりするんだよ。

4477 2018-01-03 15:29:26 I lied, I need some coconut oil though..
4478 2018-01-03 15:29:15 Linked in another videography deal with weddings and along with my oil and gas contract, and shooting promotional club videos this year. now I need at least 3 more contracts and I would be good for the time being lol let’s root for another big company.  
4479 2018-01-03 15:29:07 I don't know about the chemistry of sunflowers to say how well it would work or what would happen but better than seeds or oil.
4480 2018-01-03 15:29:01 When the mothers are wondering what the hell is wrong with the Oil... you know it's a baaaaaaaad time.
4481 2018-01-03 15:29:00 Oil want a high-pressure PK, but (outside of 97 & 93) PKers aren't physically/mentally quick enough to execute it. When F1 pressures but F2 is a step slow, cross-ice opens up. On all 3 PPG last night, F1 is pressuring up high, and F2 is hanging out below hash marks.

4484 2018-01-03 15:28:35 My issue is with restaurants.  YYC restaurants have been grossly overpriced for years.  They're going under because their oil patch clientele is gone, and they refuse to adjust pricing accordingly.
4485 2018-01-03 15:28:33 mennnh…. Agrotraders internationals is superb… And Palm oil trader
4486 2018-01-03 15:28:29 "...canola oil consumption increased body weight significantly over normal diet..."

This is just stupid.
4487 2018-01-03 15:28:29 Little tip for super dry skin. Steam & mineral oil.  If really really dry a drop of coconut milk (in the carton not the can) into mineral & whisk with fork. Then apply over steam. Be careful with steam not too hot/intense. Can use as spot treatment instead of whole face.
4488 2018-01-03 15:28:28 @RevReid3 @federicaMog people dying while you defend despotic Iran! European union only wants its oil! Great Ethics Federica as in FED UP with you!

4496 2018-01-03 15:27:26 It already has.  Time to show the top women, boots on ground that own, operate oil.  You know who I want to see recognized : )
4497 2018-01-03 15:27:19 Oil continues to rip higher (over $61).  Gas prices will follow.
4498 2018-01-03 15:27:08 Both German and French investments are minor compared to Russian and Chinese investments in Iran. Just recently 30$ bln in oil and gas. Maybe Israel should finally, finally join global sanctions against Russia? Or at least stop undermining them?
4499 2018-01-03 15:27:06 All tied to Insurance companies who help pay for the pharmaceutical companies. Many pain medications are harmful and addictive yet you can’t get non addicting and inexpensive CBD oil prescribed as an approved treatment for a whole host of things that it could remedy. Ask why? $$$

4558 2018-01-03 15:19:40 I believe Norway is replacing their carbon fuels with sustainable energy. Scotland are ahead of the game in that department, however, we lack the same oil fund as they started in the 90's, so for Scotland it'll be a means to an end. rather than the UK where they'll be no let-up.

4565 2018-01-03 15:19:16 Mr Muyiwa,  do you think getting a job in oil industry is a good thing? @MuyiwaOludayo
4566 2018-01-03 15:19:05 I would say they took a hit because the US is now on the top 10 list of suppliers with its shale oil. We count Saudi as -200Kbpd since Oct. If there is one place for Saudi to ship to even during a drawdown in inventory it would be to China because they are outside of the OECD.
4567 2018-01-03 15:19:02 I’m not sure that they are. Oil and Democrats are each other’s rhetorical punching bags, more than anything. Apart from a friendlier tax and regulatory climate, I’m not sure his departure brings about any substantive changes.

4581 2018-01-03 15:17:35 lol uae's oil reserves can't save em now and that's where taxes comes in, steroids stuff lmao

4602 2018-01-03 15:15:52 Nope. The literature is about “The Curse of Oil.” When oil is discovered every white shit on the planet is there to enslave the people, impose the worst of them as rulers, and steal the oil. Look at Japan, South Korea, Germany—no oil, great societies.

4631 2018-01-03 15:13:35 O exemplo da Standard Oil é bom. Foi exatamente para prejudicar e nivelar o mercado por baixo que as regulações foram criadas na época. Os concorrentes da S.O. não atingiam a eficiência e encontraram  no estado uma forma de conter o avanço da empresa.

4635 2018-01-03 15:13:16 Not necessarily. Fuel providers, who are primarily also oil companies, will be reluctant to displace their fossil fuel with another option unless they’re mandated to do so. Indeed, they have said they prefer a mandate to also avoid competition issues and inconsistencies.

4660 2018-01-03 15:11:49 Small addition to #HYR Hydrodec holding today at 2.55p as I believe the price continues to lag the company progress (not to mention oil price). Have held this one for a long time so has not always been pretty but will continue to do so.

4664 2018-01-03 15:11:11 Um I don t know but wherever the heat is the gases that hang over dead zone from oil spills should move back over those areas where there should be able to be a way to trap that gas and use some how or move to an area that would need extra heat from warmed moist air

4686 2018-01-03 15:09:06 Trust me...there's no need...even oil...you simply fry meat in a empty clean pan...slowly turning them ..soon as they golden brown...you add soy sauce...Cook few minutes then add sugar cook...lovely...I couldn't believe it...
4687 2018-01-03 15:08:49 Ha. Maybe he didn’t cause it, but he didn’t stand in the way either. At the very least, oil’s explosive growth undermines the narrative that BO was extremely anti-fossil fuel and hated oil companies.

4691 2018-01-03 15:08:21 "while the U.S. might need more workers in oil fields in places like West Texas." - there's a political hot potato everywhere.
4692 2018-01-03 15:08:10 Not sure comparing coconut oil to burgers makes any sense other than the saturated fat comparison. Burgers are unhealthy for many reasons and most dangerous is the crazy amount of carbs in the buns!

4717 2018-01-03 15:05:08 Several hundred *million* dollars was money Iran paid to the US for weapons to the Shah prior to the 1979 revolution. Fifty to one hundred *billion* dollars was money Iran earned from selling oil internationally from 2012-2015 that *Obama* kept frozen outside of Iran.

We suggest Avocado oil mayonnaise instead of conventional mayonnaise that is usually made with yukky grain/seed oils that promote systemic inflammation! Our mayo has only 4 ingredients - Avocado oil, Free range egg yolk, Apple cider vinegar and salt.

4738 2018-01-03 15:03:14 Exactly—we were told that the White Paper presented a credible economic case, but with Salmond's misrepresentation of the 'oil is a bonus not a basis' we could see that it wasn't a solid economic case.

4773 2018-01-03 15:00:07 We can start with the fact that economics rather than health and happiness take centre stage. (Bhutan put happiness first as govt focus).

Then GDP is the main metric yet it gets boosted when money is spent on oil spills for example. 

But the wrong people set the agenda.

4777 2018-01-03 14:59:40 thank you for this. I have been heartbroken by the products of other companies when I went to use them after a year and found only the scent of the carrier oil remained. It's good to know the lifespan up front so I can plan! :)

4782 2018-01-03 14:59:21 Development of the Acosta mine began two months before the presidential election. Trump’s  prediction of increase in coal mining jobs is highly exaggerated. The statistics show that the total jobs created includes all mining jobs i.e. oil and gas. You have research the facts.

4807 2018-01-03 14:56:21 But hydrogen is not sustainable or #Green as almost all of it (about 95%) is made from natural gas with carbon emissions as a significant byproduct. It's basically a fossil fuel & the last refuge of the oil corporations as EV sales continue to accelerate & threaten their market.

4914 2018-01-03 14:43:32 Lol. Chicken, a sizeable amount of olive oil, salt and pepper. The trick for me was to bake it so that the salt crusted up all around the chicken. And the oil sort of tenderizes it nicely.
4915 2018-01-03 14:43:21 We have a few backtweets you may want to read that explains the added income, if its net gain or net loss for workers given the oil excise tax.

4917 2018-01-03 14:42:55 @TC34 Where is the criticism from 45 to Russia for providing oil to NK? He rather talk about Kim than the Russia Investigation.
4918 2018-01-03 14:42:49 Of course Lil Rocket boy wants to  reopen communications w/South Korea. N. Korea is running out of food and oil. Turn up the sanctions.
4919 2018-01-03 14:42:45 pro tip, use jasmine essential oil in place of perfume, there are so many health benefits associated with it and it makes you smell SO amazing and seductive

4923 2018-01-03 14:42:21 Ha ha!! When I give him those big lose curls. I use water and olive oil and just fluff it honestly. Little man has the hair of the Gods though. Lol. Mine would never react like that.

4925 2018-01-03 14:42:08 Ué tem centenas de casos documentados. O nome disso é "monopólio". Pesquise pela aplicação da lei antitrust americana, começando pela Standard Oil do Rockefeller, e terá sua resposta. Geralmente a intervenção estatal vem no sentido de impedir isso.
4926 2018-01-03 14:42:05 I've been taking so much oil of oregano for my cold, I'm basically a one woman Italian restaurant at this point.

4928 2018-01-03 14:41:45 Haha, I do that and in Desi!
But I use olive oil.
4929 2018-01-03 14:41:41 And as more countries make the move to renewable energy & electric cars, demand for oil will continue to go down, as will oil related jobs.

4935 2018-01-03 14:40:57 Sitting in the car while getting an oil change is possibly one of the most awkward things

4939 2018-01-03 14:40:24 The market isn't just distorted because of subsidies that would be too simplistic to say and as usual like typical Nigerians putting the cart before the oil. The market is distorted and inefficient because of our foundation which is the MONETARY SYSTEM.

4949 2018-01-03 14:39:13 masseduction, coconut oil, saturation iii, no one ever really dies
4950 2018-01-03 14:39:11 The last time commodities were this undervalued was at the end of the 90s. 2000-2001 recession still made oil price lose 50%. Then the rally you mention.

4952 2018-01-03 14:38:55 Interested to see how Trump’s disingenuous support of Iranian citizens continues to unfold. Let’s see how fast US oil stakes a claim on countries - like India, South Korea, China, and Japan - which are normally supplied oil by Iran. #UlteriorMotive #TrumpLIES #Resist
4953 2018-01-03 14:38:48 Boil them before for about 10/15 mins before (this will help make them fluffy on the inside) then pre heat the oil in a tray in oven then pop them in oil and shake so there covered then in about 30/45 mins they should be crispy. Check on them every 10 mins and shake

4961 2018-01-03 14:37:46 Girl i hate going to my dealership after the last time. DUB. I pay $40 for an oil change, tire rotation, battery check, brake check, and air filter change.

4964 2018-01-03 14:36:51 Over Regulations kill industry, now just because reg is gone does not mean that companies can just pollute environment! Fines & penalties still exist! #Obamas over Regulating against oil industry for example has killed jobs on the gulf coast! No one ever talks about that?
4965 2018-01-03 14:36:25 Thank you. I did request olbas oil in the hazer, but I don’t think they took me seriously! 
4966 2018-01-03 14:35:52 Sooo I used tea tree oil on my face and now I feel that icy hot feeling on my face as I walk outside

4969 2018-01-03 14:35:42 I can’t understand why someone would take a fish oil supplement day in, day out.
It’s a lot more effective to eat oily fish and then drink the oil that comes from it.

4974 2018-01-03 14:35:24 More oil production in the US also means less dependence on oil from outside the US. Self reliance has always been a cornerstone of American excellence. Countries that hate us have had control of the oil we need way too long. Thanks @POTUS for your leadership on this issue.
4975 2018-01-03 14:35:15 Lol..... They've discovered crude oil already na
4976 2018-01-03 14:35:13 On why @NNPCgroup has failed,   it is a Deliberate sabotage and corruption
Russia, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, UAE, Qater as well as other Arab oil reach countries have used there state oil firm to develop there country.
If Nigeria failed to succeed,it is the people who refused fix it.
4977 2018-01-03 14:35:08 WHO WOULD WASTE TACOS?!?!
4978 2018-01-03 14:35:06 I was looking at my notes from when I first bought #SQZ & opex was <$20 Oil & the price of oil at the time was about $25. The talk then was oil going to $10-15 a barrel. Biggest risk was always lack of asset diversification in my mind but now eradicated & throwing off cash
4979 2018-01-03 14:35:05 We use oil. It used to be insanely expensive about 10-12 years ago. That's why we put in the wood furnace. The wood is free (minus labor). Oil is much cheaper now, but wood is still free.

4998 2018-01-03 14:33:39 People keep asking "when is the appropriate time?" I think you all know as well as I do that he is waiting for Iran to wage a civil war and be reduced to shambles so he can move in on the oil. Then, and only then, will he fully support what's left of the people of Iran.
4999 2018-01-03 14:33:36 They had a small army of people paid to find a Native American link for her.  Step 1 would be the simple DNA test like 23andMe.

5000 2018-01-03 14:33:34 If somebody can afford five grand every year, for a season ticket they must be minted! A few percent increase is peanuts! Every body else who travels to work has to put up with oil price fluctuations throughout the year, live with it!

5056 2018-01-03 14:27:04 Seems unfair that Iranians remain poor despite the end of most sanctions, the recent rise in oil prices and the huge $400 million cash injection into the Iranian economy, courtesy of former President Obama. Perhaps they spent it all on terrorism and nuclear weapons production?

5091 2018-01-03 14:22:22 N87 was not the true price. N87 was the subsidised price that's why even with oil at $28, price could be increased to N145. If subsidy had been removed in 2012, 4 years earlier, fuel would have been ~N141.

5153 2018-01-03 14:16:28 Gas is short for gasoline. So gasoline, when broken down into its parts, perfectly describes what petroleum is: an oil form of a natural gas. We also called it this way back and to, of course, be different from the UK.

5200 2018-01-03 14:11:56 Wales has little in common with the Nordics - apart from geography and population size... widely different historical experiences; oil wealth (Norway); and huge multinationals in Sweden and Denmark... The idea of Nordic co-op is a good model to follow, but little more than that.

5211 2018-01-03 14:11:00 The killings in Benue is a shame on us all, a supposedly modern country. A country takes care of its people. This country only takes of its govt. 

The chest of our rulers only shows when 'treason' and 'oil pipelines' are in issue. They do not care when our lives are the issue.

5213 2018-01-03 14:10:35 And our economic success is because we tax oil companies and invest that tax in our pension fund. $1 Trillion in it so far. We use approx a third of the dividends towards the national budget.

5227 2018-01-03 14:08:39 First of all, Muslims divided into two sections "sunna" like Saudi Arabia who is against terrorism and "shia'a" like Iran who make wars and terrorism ... we are oppressed by social media, I think because we have the oil and when we decide to stop exporting it ..

5240 2018-01-03 14:07:40 Am I the only one who thinks it hugely coincidental that as the oil and gas prices fell, Ineos' Forties Field pipeline suddenly sprang a leak, thus creating a shortage. Jim Radcliffe wouldn't do that would he?

5246 2018-01-03 14:07:10 Thought3: GCC countries know that their cities are vulnerable- Abu Dhabi, Jaddah and Riyadh are within the range of Iranian firepower, war on Iran would trigger an oil crisis with ramifications on the rest of the world. #IranProtests

But maybe prices in your area are higher idk.

5280 2018-01-03 14:02:36 This is NOT true. Oil marketers have revealed as recent as this week that they own 80% of depots and tank farms as well as retail outlets in the logistics and distribution system of that sector.

5326 2018-01-03 13:56:56 As long as it keeps getting devalued, once Crude oil prices rise or FX Exchange weakens landing cost increases if imported and then we go back to same problems. If refined locally, same issues once they have to source dollars at devalued rates to buy Crude oil to refine.

5356 2018-01-03 13:54:48 Look at the whole picture it’s not only the oil prices. It’s also our lack of access to pipelines for export and regulatory requirements that make it non profitable. We are losing investments.
5357 2018-01-03 13:54:41 So in other industries, “so far as is reasonably practicable” is applied (as per U.K. law regarding health and safety at work). This translates to as low as reasonably practicable, which requires a considered, risk-based approach (nuclear, aviation, oil and gas, chemical).

5433 2018-01-03 13:46:45 "Bunker" is the supply of fuel to vessel tank to power the vessel and the steam. So using of oil "Bunkerer" is wrong rather it is called "Pipeline Vandaliser" or "vandalism?"
5434 2018-01-03 13:46:33 Bet anyone a dollar he’s got wild eyes for Iranian oil fields. Just imagine how corrupt a Trump admin embedded to aid Iran democratization process would be. Tehran would look like Atlantic City in 6 months.
5435 2018-01-03 13:46:19 I guess it’s like laundry or cooking. Some of us were taught & it has to be weird for those who weren’t. I didn’t even know my oil needed to be changed until I was almost 20. It’s the complaining that’s weird to me.

5440 2018-01-03 13:45:25 But Nigerians are forever making oil jokes 
5441 2018-01-03 13:45:07 FYI! If you are in New England & are having trouble getting oil delivered, you can take a 5 Gal BLUE gas container & fill it with diesel fuel to get you by! Works the same & won't hurt your furnace. Stay warm! 
5442 2018-01-03 13:45:07 It will also interest you to note that the midstream sector of the oil and gas industry is largely dominated by PPMC. No other depot owner comes close to its logistics expanse, reach and ROW.
5443 2018-01-03 13:45:07 Nothing if they can run it properly. Forte oil and co can operate in the regulated market and make money from subsidy that's why they are there. Serious multinational contenders will be deterred by the current regulated market.

5446 2018-01-03 13:44:56 It could do, yes. Maybe try a warm bath? Feel tummy to see if swollen. Bit of olive oil on vent can help apparently although humans never did that.

5455 2018-01-03 13:43:03 You also change your oil about half as often with full synthetic. Overall, it is just better for your car. And "long run" could be anywhere from another 3000 miles to 30000. Dude, I understand being really poor, but you could save money by instead doing it yourself.

5464 2018-01-03 13:41:48 Anyway, if you're into brown rice like me, R65 for 2 at Makro. And I got 1kg of extra virgin olive oil for R100.

5476 2018-01-03 13:40:32 In the US in the '60s, self-serve pumps were rare. Attendants offered to check the oil & cleaned the windshield. Once people had the choice, they nearly always chose to pump it themselves for a few cents less per gallon. Now full-serve pumps are the rarity
5477 2018-01-03 13:40:12 え、君顎あるの？顎ってやっぱりどこかで買うの？僕顎持ってないんだけど。
5478 2018-01-03 13:40:11 10% are are natural resources companies, whose earnings are dependent on the price of oil and metals. That again is internationally driven not domestically. 
On investment take Investec and Melrose which are FTSE 250’s first and second largest by market capitalisation.
5479 2018-01-03 13:40:02 Festival no es la palabra. Un robo total. Los Cirigliano se robaron más de 1500 millones. El hermano de Agustín Rossi debe ser investigado por tener 16 empresas de transporte. El hermano de Jaime, otro ladrón. Cristobal López evacuó 4000 millones en gas oil subsidiado. Un saqueo.
5480 2018-01-03 13:39:57 Get some skin in the game, destroy their military infrastructure then do a 50/50 deal with Saudi to exploit their oil 
5481 2018-01-03 13:39:53 My portfolio did poorly for most of Obama’s terms, but we were in it for the long haul and with a significant amt of Bank of America, oil and others I’m thrilled right now!
5482 2018-01-03 13:39:51 I think they are saying they can't sell at N145 which is lower than the landing cost given the world oil price movement, exchange rate and domestic inflation.
5483 2018-01-03 13:39:48 @Alamo hi there, I’ve rented a car from you from Miami airport and an alert has appeared saying the oil needs changing, surely this should have been done prior to us having the car? we r currently in Bradenton, can you advise?
5484 2018-01-03 13:39:34 While I agree with u, I also do not expect the govt to be daft and accept anti-people recommendations from the petroleum marketers. It is actually good that they come together and find lasting solutions to the lingering crisis in the oil and gas sector of the Nigerian economy.
5485 2018-01-03 13:39:32 A spike in mining deaths this yr. y? Deregulation. Now deregulated offshore oil. He is letting fox guard henhouse again. Profit always trumps safety with corporations
5486 2018-01-03 13:39:19 No Canada's export oil from Alberta oil sands is discounted so much at the border v. WTC I suspect it's sold at a loss!
5487 2018-01-03 13:39:02 Also, the fact that a thriving system gives improved income to the government via taxes, only adds to the argument that our oil industry will be better off, considering the existence of NNPC Retail and PPMC.
5488 2018-01-03 13:38:42 @theSNP America is now self sufficient in oil and gas. You wanted Scotland to be self sufficient and independent yet you banned fracking. We could have had low gas for decades. Congrats.

You did it! Excellent list of Self-care advice. I'm going to borrow some of these, too. Been meaning to get a fidget spinner, and I adore my oil diffuser 
5491 2018-01-03 13:38:22 We need new 'Heroes' and Role models in Southern Nigeria. Imagine an Oil Bunkerer (Militant) having the biggest house in a village with his house bigger than that of a Senator (12 yrs in senate). You see what the kids are seeing...

5499 2018-01-03 13:37:14 there is nothing overly repressive in Iran, its US & UK deliberately infiltrating & causing unrest for Israel . $$$$s are at stake for oil! UK & US are committing crimes & have no place in Middle east
5500 2018-01-03 13:37:10 Albert, the fact is that investment is down in the oil sands not because of our policy in Canada but predominantly that of world oil prices versus cost of production. Pipelines won't change that (but it would be nice). This tweet from Scheer it misinforms (again) about reality.

5530 2018-01-03 13:34:01 Taste Nirvana in glass bottle. No pulp. Try 'pulling oil'. You swish small amt coconut oil in mouth for 15mins or less then spit in trash, otherwise you'll clog pipes up.

5534 2018-01-03 13:33:52 I swear by my medicated coconut oil, the past three periods I have had my cramps have been so crippling, I had to leave work one time, putting the coconut oil over my lower stomach & lower back subsides the pain in the first 25 minutes & after 30-40 I no longer feel my cramps :)

5542 2018-01-03 13:33:17 Hi Chris, you mentioned in earlier posts that you think the energy dominance strategy is to keep oil price range from 50 - 60. Do you still have the same view and could I ask how you derived this price range?

5545 2018-01-03 13:32:57 All these comments about the protests in #Iran not affecting oil production because they are urban and away from production areas are fubar.

Just because you work somewhere does not matter.

5624 2018-01-03 13:22:04 Yes. Heaven forfend we would want to regulate oil and gas producers, particularly now with the overabundance of fossil fuels in nearly every developed country.
5625 2018-01-03 13:21:48 I need a new beard oil or butter, something that keeps my shit moisturized. Cause you know beards and women

5628 2018-01-03 13:21:24 Can I use yesterday's accomplishments to feel good about today maybe not having any? 
Because, like, I got my oil changed, got groceries, did the dishes, AND did lunch prep.

5638 2018-01-03 13:19:38 I’m workin for a guy that has over 200,000 acres of land. He has 22 oil pumps that produce 150,000 dollars profit each, every day. Needless to say I want this life
5639 2018-01-03 13:19:37 oil is not drink

5646 2018-01-03 13:18:38 Hence the #irony hashtag :D but yeah...sure the situation may be more complex. And NK doesn't have any oil.
5647 2018-01-03 13:18:36 Crude oil price is not within our control, what is the point of discussing it? We should be focused on the issues which are within our control.
5648 2018-01-03 13:18:32 Omg why have I never thought of this. Coconut oil in the bath works??
5649 2018-01-03 13:18:24 esa es la jugada en Colombia para que nada suba, y si no es el dolar es el oil y si no es ninguno de esos es porque la bolsa de Somalia cayó y habia que acompañarla, asi la BVC se ha hecho la boba con la gran subida que ha tenido NYSE en años, mi opinion, saludos
5650 2018-01-03 13:18:14 You still going round in circles. Are you saying Crude Oil prices and FX Exchange let alone logistics and distribution are not a problem with fuel scarcity in Nigeria? That was the crux of my response as I don't know what point you trying to make.
5651 2018-01-03 13:18:12 Once you get past like wk 3 or 4 you’re good! If your nipples hurt use coconut oil or just squeeze milk on them. I’m 20 months in so feel free to hit me up if you need support.

5657 2018-01-03 13:17:25 Market summaries. Dollar index started out the New Years hitting some low levels. Since a majority of my investments are in CAD this is good news. Silver futures leading the metals charge up. Natural gas recovering nicely on this freezing weather. Oil hitting multi year highs
5658 2018-01-03 13:17:16 Synthesizing the $XRP debate:
: Fast and cheap and will be used as the oil between global financial institutions 
: Premined, majority-owned (by Ripple), effectively centralized and therefore not truly censorship resistant

Fair synthesis?
5659 2018-01-03 13:16:53 The forecast for Tundra on Friday/Saturday still applies. You DON'T want to be outside on these two days. Preparing for the cold coming Friday/Saturday every bit as important as preparing for the snowstorm/blizzard on Thursday. Make sure your oil feed lines are well-insulated

5661 2018-01-03 13:16:11 I hope we dont have moore oil spilled from the keystone pipe line. That's not better its worse. Coal mining deaths tripled in 2017. Hopefully it doesn't quadruple in 2018. That's not better. Moore mass shootings aw Trump's America. Foreclosures coming in 2018.

5663 2018-01-03 13:15:57 Then why is he going about with security details? Can you explain that? America wants the Arab oil hence why all these terrorism started in the first place. We are more enlightened now than in the Stone Age.

5672 2018-01-03 13:14:39 Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, said that it has agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle a U.S. class action brought by investors who claim they lost money as a result of a corruption scandal.
5673 2018-01-03 13:14:36 They almost use renewable energy to charge up there cars , including policy to incentive people who buy electric cars.

The proceeds they get after exporting oil to countries is used to do that.
5674 2018-01-03 13:14:31 Is it not remarkable? Simple oil of cloves, and how amazing the results
5675 2018-01-03 13:14:10 Two-thirds (70%) of the downstream oil market in their countries. No sane nation leaves it entirely in the hands of few individuals laissez-faire like Nigeria. By the way I don't get what point you driving at.  I took my time to give you a detailed response. Are you saying

5696 2018-01-03 13:10:23 Yeah I've wondered that myself. Was it when Saddam set the oil wells on fire  & they burned for over a year, or when whole cities burned in WWII, or maybe it got just right & toasty during all the atmospheric atomic bomb testing....or not. I'm confused.

5701 2018-01-03 13:10:16 One of the first things Buhari did when he became president was to propose borrowing from China by pledging Nigeria's crude oil still in the ground effectively mortgaging the country's entire future.

5724 2018-01-03 13:06:22 I am in favour of  Nuclear energy, if only because predicting long term oil price is a futile job. Having said that, these big government schemes with no skin in the game by proponents are usually rubbish any which way you slice it.

5761 2018-01-03 13:01:12 You are so kind. I'm stopping by the oil company on the way to work to give them some $. I told the farmers they can give me a calf in the spring. But I tell you I just weep inside at our rural situations up here.
5762 2018-01-03 13:00:57 In light of the impending nuclear winter, does anyone have a good cockroach recipe? And does sautéing in gun oil change the flavor more than say, a good olive oil? Asking for a friend...

5838 2018-01-03 12:50:03 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.
5839 2018-01-03 12:49:59 A few things to consider in this case, average earnings of the citizen and the country itself import oils because they dont produce oil whereas our country does.
5840 2018-01-03 12:49:37 At what cost? Regulation on climate change did bring about substantial investment in renewables, but Here is an argument it was net negative, given the decay in coal and oil fired investment and the concomitant decline in efficiency.
5841 2018-01-03 12:49:32 Brent crude popping up again, have a short on as I expect oil to be $60-65 on average 2018. will increase short if price rises.

5843 2018-01-03 12:49:10 It makes sense to export to the larger market, but Alberta both produces oil and has significant refining capacity.  So why do the pay more at the pump???  Taxes! You all should be paying less, that's the point is was trying, apparently unsuccessfully, to make

5865 2018-01-03 12:45:55 Ridiculous. All that article is comparing is prices, not satisfaction. In 75 inflation was at 24% and there were still latent effects of the oil crises. There is no like for like comparison here, so the figures are irrelevant.

5868 2018-01-03 12:45:38 Yes. Same towns. Oil business is hard work, high risk in a free market. You can lose everything in an oil venture if it fails. Imagine a lot of these folks slaved to build up a business & mullahs robbed everything & then wealth is dissipated to create Hezbollah crap elsewhere.
5869 2018-01-03 12:45:31 Buhari signed and approved $26bn worth of oil contracts illegally on his sick leave and with his VP acting officially bypassing the NNPC Board and Fed Executive Council - well beyond his anticipatory approval limit & equal Nigeria's budget. Yet GEJ is corrupt per Buhari & APC
5870 2018-01-03 12:45:26 How about devolving ALL taxes raised and originated in Scotland ie  oil gas electricity whiskey, fuel pump sales , then if a mess is made , you can complain. Truth is, NO infrastructure building would happen under a Tory gov up here.

5873 2018-01-03 12:44:25 I agree. It's important to move fast and be very strategic with our balance sheet assets. Think of oil producing countries who have failed to manage their resources well. That commodity will soon be a thing of the past.

5877 2018-01-03 12:44:09 Use of plastic is a problem but not the only problem - manufacture is another.  It's perfectly possible to manufacture plastics that biodegrade quickly from hemp rather than oil.

6037 2018-01-03 12:19:32 The enormous economic contribution of the oil & gas industry to many national economies makes its future of critical importance to the global community. Yet despite the instrumental role oil & gas plays  the industry itself is facing some profound challenges

6043 2018-01-03 12:18:26 Hi Ellie, we advice against it because our Bath& Shower Oils contain a high percentage of essential oils of up to 30% which get absorbed into the skin& the blood stream. However our Renewing Rose range& our Support Supersensitive Body Oil are safe during pregnancy& breastfeeding
6044 2018-01-03 12:18:23 Is that the "ex-food and energy inflation" that Bernanke/Yellin FED had been using as reference when oil was $120 or the inflation that includes food and energy they had been using for reference when oil was $40?

6046 2018-01-03 12:17:29 I agree. Mullahs are scum. Too bad the Americans kicked the democratically elected Iranian president out in 1953 cause he wanted to nationalize the oil reserves. Who knows what had happened if they hadn’t?

えっでもそれ割り算って……えー……？掛算だけど割り算なのややこしいなあ……

6311 2018-01-03 11:29:31 Well I was treating hyperpigmantation and spots . African black soap is good for any problem skin. I use Apple cider vinegar as toner. And coconut oil or shear butter as moisturiser. Even use some essential oils at night.
6312 2018-01-03 11:29:17 Or silicon based oil? (As we all know wd40 isn’t actually a lubricant)

6315 2018-01-03 11:28:41 Mi gente

In love estoy con el oil to foam cleanser y el acid de Holika Holika y solo lo he usado dos veces
6316 2018-01-03 11:28:11 Our renewables industry is on an upwards trend. Although suppressed somewhat by the UK government. It will dwarf oil in due course. I don't see the Norwegians complaining about being the the best country in the world to live in as recently reported.
6317 2018-01-03 11:28:10 But will it help with a small oil leak on my VMAX?
6318 2018-01-03 11:27:59 @mrjamesob if, as you say, your little one wouldn’t have known the difference between your goose fat rosties and the olive oil ones, they can’t be that good. ;)

6334 2018-01-03 11:25:01 Saudia Arabia = good. Iran = bad. 
That's because we buy their oil and sell them weapons. 
Saudia Arabia = Sunni. Iran = Shiite.
But Sunni extremism (Salafism) gave rise to ISIS who are keen to wipe out all Shiites. So selling arms to Saudi Arabia is helping ISIS. Shit.

PROFIT

6348 2018-01-03 11:21:54 Walter Trump, snake oil salesmen and con artist said we will all be safe when he builds a wall
6349 2018-01-03 11:21:52 If you want to take credit for this, then you need to take criticism for the fact that our oil and gas prices are rising.
6350 2018-01-03 11:21:37 Paris Climate could have brought millions of new jobs, meawhile those pipelines are leaking oil all over, no Net Neutrality will hike ISP prices, record stocks are only indicative of an upcoming crash, taxes only cut for the rich, & those court appoints are unqualified & biased.
6351 2018-01-03 11:21:15 Low oil price, employment up. Cars are an inherently unstable and dangerous form of travel, and USA too suburban and spread out
6352 2018-01-03 11:20:59 BC学園、良い…
6353 2018-01-03 11:20:34 Well..that's strange while Saudi economy s is in crisis becaz of oil prices...last week,price hike in petrol was 127% with VAT on public...
6354 2018-01-03 11:20:29 The fennel oil. I bought it at one of those Egyptian expos, but i think you can find it wherever essential oil is sold
6355 2018-01-03 11:20:17 Is this the Anchor tank one that made the rounds? I hope it isn't true. Less shields!

Heroes announced Firebat from Starcraft and his kit is perfect for an Overwatch tank. He sets things on fire, lays oil spills down and sets them on fire. A defence/Tank hybrid would be great.
6356 2018-01-03 11:20:09 Keep in mind that the same types of expert commentators that the media rolls out to tell us the world economy is screwed this year once told us that oil was running out, China was going to rule the world, and that we were entering a period of global cooling.
6357 2018-01-03 11:19:44 Why is oil so,,,,,, oily

6371 2018-01-03 11:17:07 Higher wages in Saudi are because it exports 27 times more oil per capita. Nigeria does not have the revenues to have high wages, low fuel prices and a state that might provide roads, education, defence, etc

6373 2018-01-03 11:16:33 Also we were sat on an income bonanza with North Sea oil in the 70s/80s, which if Thatcher and the then Tory Govt had invested properly would mean prosperity for all. But that's against Tory principles.
6374 2018-01-03 11:16:26 I used this oil and it was more effective than painkillers. Also hot water bottles and hydration.

6386 2018-01-03 11:14:17 If Turkey actually shows backbone and holds fast against theft of Syrian territory so oil tycoons can plunder her resources and globalist banks and set up central banking then the land locked territory will have little to offer their masters and will likely be abandoned.
6387 2018-01-03 11:14:09 Not True. The gold backing the oil contracts is a fake news, and not real. Only thing real in the news is that the contracts can be priced in yuans, thus giving a blow to the the petro dollar.
6388 2018-01-03 11:14:04 I understand, but shouldn't there be balance? The oil industry made 93 BILLION in PROFITS last year. That's like "extra money."  The regulation just removed makes us and earth less safe, but gives them additional 900 million. Why?

6404 2018-01-03 11:12:06 Higher wages in Saudi reflect the fact the country exports 27 times more oil per person than Nigeria
6405 2018-01-03 11:11:57 He’s cutting regulations that foul the air & water, favors oil & gas over renewables, opens national parks to private industry, and puts more money in the pockets of the 1%. Yeah, thank goodness for that.
6406 2018-01-03 11:11:57 Anarchy, democracy, kleptocracy, oligarchy, kakocracy....what's the term for 'government by chancers, blaggers, bullshitters and snake oil merchants'?
6407 2018-01-03 11:11:32 But Saudi can afford a higher minimum wage because it exports 27 times more oil per capita than Nigeria
6408 2018-01-03 11:11:19 Hello Penguin, the oil is just the paste mixed to a specific amount, you can make your own tinctures or caps from the paste.
6409 2018-01-03 11:11:16 I just try and gradually swap to healthier options and then keep it that way. I’ve swapped butter for coconut butter and milk for coconut milk. I swapped pasta for wholemeal. Cooking oil for coconut oil. Just doing it slowly but surely. And tbh I don’t eat much sugar anyway xxx

Yet the price of fuel was increased from 85NGR to145NGR. @ProfOsinbajo said govt increased the fuel prices. So the #Nigeria govt cheated and lied

6587 2018-01-03 10:34:16 Absolutely. He's been dipped in boiling oil as we speak.
6588 2018-01-03 10:33:38 They might export more oil but oil is not the only way to make money. Nigeria has a lot more resources that can be harnessed and the govt needs to do more rather than heap all the burden on the people. Lets start by cutting nat assembly wages which is among d highest in d world.
6589 2018-01-03 10:33:27 Could you define "affordable" when we're one of the highest in Europe for energy costs, and THE lowest for climate change action? When renewable costs are 5c/kwH and grid is 16 and up to 42c for poorest, how's that "affordable", before the 700m fine & health impacts of oil/gas?
6590 2018-01-03 10:32:42 Coconut oil is horrible for your face. It clogs yours pores and causes breakouts!!!

6593 2018-01-03 10:32:23 Laughable. You care about Iranian oil and its strategic location, I grant you that much. But the people? No, you don't care about the Iranian people.
6594 2018-01-03 10:32:12 Also, each morning when I pray I eat bread as Jesus' body given for me, for the world. I drink the fruit of the vine as Jesus' blood shed for me, the seal of the new covenant. And I anoint myself with oil to receive his Holy Spirit's empowering for my daily co-working with him.

6635 2018-01-03 10:26:00 and the iran issue is much more than just hijab issue the USA is now after iran as its the only major oil producer in the ME they havent destroyed
6636 2018-01-03 10:25:43 According to Kermit Roosevelt's autobiography 'Countercoup' it was US led and marked the shift from UK dominance in Iran to US dominance. Greater US penetration of Iran's oil industry resulted.
6637 2018-01-03 10:25:41 Meh! Four days ago Trump was accusing China of sending oil to North Korea. Then he accused Iran of oppression and called Pakistan a terrorist state. Everyday it's a new outrage. Tomorrow it will be still more desperate diversion from the main story #TrumpRussiaCollusion

6725 2018-01-03 10:07:06 ICE is dying. And that's good. We still import too much oil.

6864 2018-01-03 09:39:45 #Iraq exported more than 109 million oil barrels during the month of December, the #Iraqi oil ministry declared on Tuesday.

6883 2018-01-03 09:35:26 Manufacturing was a wonderful way to get into tech. I love both but tech is much more fun. Data is a part of almost everything but to call it oil “the prize” something different. Data needs years of time & wars fought for it to be oil. I hope data isn’t going to be as fought over

6909 2018-01-03 09:31:18 What like Oil 
6910 2018-01-03 09:31:16 In comparison, since Russian oil money, Bournemouth ain’t a little club, that just desperate fan mentality, need to admit they are a club who spend big, no more ‘little old Bournemouth’ taking over the town, losing green belts so they can have training grounds.. stoke spend less.
6911 2018-01-03 09:31:04 Without geoshocks upside there still caped within 70-80 range likely for this year.  Above 65 (wti) shale oil producers will raise volumes significantly, likely.  Still plenty of capital there.  But 2019-2020 looking more interesting :)

6920 2018-01-03 09:29:17 Brotherly! This is simple.starting a new year with fuel scarcity in a country that is producing this same oil is uncalled for. Now tweets from the presidency shouldn't be about stuffs like feeding students when sensitive issues about how the whole nation shld feed is pushed aside
6921 2018-01-03 09:29:05 Not Milk. But a little bit of oil and sugar.

6934 2018-01-03 09:25:26 The solution lies in delegulation. Free market access of goods and services.

6935 2018-01-03 09:25:19 Local unrefined oils are best. Til oil has great benefits.

It's insanity.
6962 2018-01-03 09:20:07 How long until we send our troops to Iran to bring "freedom and democracy" to the Iranian people? For once can we let a nation do what it wants with its own oil, its own currency and its banking system? The repeating pattern is making the NWO plan obvious.

6980 2018-01-03 09:15:30 i think geo political issues will keep oil above $60 for forseable future - if iran has further sanctions reinstated see $70 + 
issue remains russia have agreed to opec cutbacks under duress - if usa increase production russia will break agreements and then see $40-$45 range

7005 2018-01-03 09:12:20 My roommate just made a delicious tuna udon dish - with a @SavorySpiceShop spice mix and charcoal, finely-ground tuna, and tandoori oil.  The charcoal offset the coloring from the oil and spice mix, and gave the noodles this *blue* color.  It is hearty and spicy, but not heavy.

7010 2018-01-03 09:11:52 Or is that good? It looks as if the spicy oil and red pepper were cooked together for a hundred years just to be used in that dish.
7011 2018-01-03 09:11:43 That's the truth of the matter. The Government should do the needful. After all, it follows circular flow of income. If the Government gets more income from selling crude oil, and the importers too will have to pay more to import as a result of increase in exchange rate.

7048 2018-01-03 09:02:09 Literally: add oil (like for a car). It’s almost always used to mean “keep going” / similar as an encouragement :)
7049 2018-01-03 09:01:59 Why do you keep wanting to drill for oil? Why do you guys want coal back? There's no sustainable future in those fields. But what concerns me more is, this isn't a left vs right issue. I'm concerned as to why you think someone like Donald would suddenly fight for regular ppl.

7145 2018-01-03 08:38:20 Let me guess. Today's API Weekly Crude Oil Stock results will be very high what will force the oil price correction and will strenght the dollar and sink the #gold - just guessing? Everything seems to be prepared under this scenario.
7146 2018-01-03 08:37:45 We are in support
7147 2018-01-03 08:37:38 The last price adjustment was due to higher FX,  though Crude oil prices were low. With higher crude prices (+ higher FCY receipt, inflow from FPI, etc), perhaps CBN should consider slight adjustment so the N145 will make commercial sense.

7151 2018-01-03 08:36:58 To participate in the butchering is no moral choice of any kind. As for BP, the USA and UK helped depose Mossadecq (democratically-elected Iranian leader) in 1953 after he nationalised Iranian oil. If I were an Iranian, I might prefer Russia.

7154 2018-01-03 08:36:37 No it is propaganda by D regime 2say that so they can suppress D uprising& kill ppl. We Iranians hve been living under an#IASIS regime 4 40 years.

7246 2018-01-03 08:14:48 Actually they are healthier than the refined sugar..

7280 2018-01-03 08:08:43 #Blackstone's Byron Wien says #Oil will go above $80 as "populism, tribalism and anarchy spread around the world" in his annual list of surprises.
He sees stock speculation in 2018 will lead to a short correction in the S&P 500.
Last year, he said #stocks would climb 12% in 2017
7281 2018-01-03 08:07:49 I started a new oil painting and it makes me excited everyday to work on it. Also I sold the Nature of Death painting before it is even finished, feeling pretty good so far 2018.

7283 2018-01-03 08:07:42 I'm going to be so tired today. Been up since like 11 am yesterday and have to be at work at 4:30 am this morning and then have an oil change/TR right after.

7285 2018-01-03 08:07:21 Kuwait was going to get their protection needs met, either by the US or by the USSR. They offered fuels & lub oil, access to entire PG, Strategic Air & Land force position if needed, & for the USSR, a warm water port.
7286 2018-01-03 08:07:11 City will make 4 marquee signings and pay better wages, Jose needs to make our players and team better by coaching the #MUFC way. As long as there is oil we will never out buy City but Gomes, Martial, Rashford, Jesse etc etc could outplay them
7287 2018-01-03 08:07:09 Playing a game and frequently when I ignite a puddle of oil and it goes [poof/boom], my co-op partner's computer crashes. Any thoughts on what the problem might be? First instinct is GPU, but possibly a CPU issue.
7288 2018-01-03 08:07:08 Engine runs on leaded fuel. If you don’t warm it, all the thick gluggy lead sludge captured by the oil sits in the sump. The reason we don’t warm it in cars anymore is because we run them on unleaded.
7289 2018-01-03 08:07:06 This growth is attributed to the oil sector but to what extent do Ghanaians benefit from the oil sector?

7294 2018-01-03 08:05:44 I expect such comment from a myopic person like you. Oil is the only product you sell at a particular price yet you still don't have control over the price despite being a producer. You can't comprehend beyond the limit of your brain. More knowledge is needed.

Every politicians knows Mullahs are and what they have been doing but never said anything, cause oil and gas was sold very cheap

7319 2018-01-03 07:59:45 Are our leaders thinking in this light. We were still searching for crude oil in the north as at last year. Our leaders are talking of diversification but holding on so much to this same oil that is bringing us more tears and hardship.
7320 2018-01-03 07:59:39 Unrelated to rash: I make my dog food too. Pretty much same ingredients as you (I us extra lean grnd beef, but I add eggs, organ meat, cod liver oil and safflower oil.) I eliminated legume, as they  cause gas. Their intestines are not long enough to digest it properly.
7321 2018-01-03 07:59:27 Mmm....I'd be iffy and mix in a face oil to be careful. Stick to brown sugar for it, too. But if still be extra careful

7374 2018-01-03 07:45:28 This sounds crazy, but I have 2 old country remedies that may or may not work! The first one is to pour vegetable oil on it and try to get the oil in there by pushing it in with a butter knife or offset spatula! The 2nd thing is to try the above thing except with lighter fluid
7375 2018-01-03 07:45:23 No kidding. Wow, just wow. What about tire pressure, wiper fluid and oil levels? There going to be a state of mass chaos and confusion there

7377 2018-01-03 07:44:17 If your hair doesn't agree with coconut oil, it can mean that your hair it sensitive to protein mimicers. Coconut oil is a protein mimicer. Olive oil, jbco, or any moisture heavy oil will work better. Also most shea moisture conditioners are vegan

Tataas pa lalo ang pasahe sa oil price hike. Tataas din ang presyo ng mga bilihin na ibinabiyahe pa sa mga malalayo. #LigwakGanern

7404 2018-01-03 07:39:16 Honestly them oil pens are dope and convenient but rolling and smoking ya own blunt is therapeutic
7405 2018-01-03 07:39:00 They believe it removes the vernix caseosa on the new born than the olive oil used in the hospital.

7407 2018-01-03 07:38:34 Seems a bit odd to me that you had a clear idea of the issues in 2005 but couldn't remember who you voted for and even more odd that you had a clear idea of the issues in 2010 and voted for a snake oil salesman like Gove?
7408 2018-01-03 07:38:28 Are these same Mayors supporting Non stop Geoengineering chemicals being sprayed? Those chemicals are also killing our planet. The only solution is to use other solutions for Energy than Oil.
7409 2018-01-03 07:38:22 CRUDE OIL was moving higher during the holiday, WTI is now traded at 60.30 USD per barrel. The U.S. indicies are maintaining the BULLISH course.
7410 2018-01-03 07:37:55 It's *law* in NJ. You don't have to tip. And it's actually a lot cheaper than in most states because of all the oil refineries nearby.

7428 2018-01-03 07:34:55 The demand for oil should be on a decline, thus prices should decline too after the holidays with less money in people's hands. 

The @doe_ph, @DtiPhilippines must keep tab if the price hikes are fair and with basis
7429 2018-01-03 07:34:44 Highlighter is meant to enhance your best face feature not make it look like you washed your face with extra virgin olive oil.

7431 2018-01-03 07:34:21 I think Putin is sending oil To NK MOL secretly... & letting"us" blame China. It's COLD there, & no one should freeze over 'sanctions' policies. N&SKorea talking w/o "us" is gonna piss THUMP off BIG-TIME. He NEEDS to be in that loop, for "the optics"to his base! ^..^
7432 2018-01-03 07:34:18 1st time my husband smelt it he mentioned it smelt like blueberry pancakes and I had never noticed that before. It's all I smell now when I put it on .

My cats like to lick lotion and oil off my hands, it's annoying but funny.

7434 2018-01-03 07:34:00 OK, simple example, "snake oil"=no regulation, modern healthcare=lots of regulation, so even if someone is dumb as... can draw the right conclusion. #ThinkForYourself

7441 2018-01-03 07:32:56 My guess would be crooked real estate deals, and then there was a price cheating scandal involving Pilot oil company owned by his family operating here in Nashville Tennessee
7442 2018-01-03 07:32:41 It's unfortunate how prices of all goods are oil price dependent. It obvious we have price regulatory boards but where are they? DPR? .......

7445 2018-01-03 07:31:51 a thing: I've been taking hemp oil (not cbd, just like, pressed hemp seeds) for two weeks and my fibro is about 50% better. there's something to those Amazon reviews saying it's magical 
7446 2018-01-03 07:31:48 im just having a flashback to all the tv shows and movies where they pump their own gas and wondering wHY I NEVER QUESTIONED IT UNTIL NOW??? that's wild, there's always people at the stations here that do it for you and can check ur oil and shit im Shook
7447 2018-01-03 07:31:13 no oil is healthy... oil means only triglycerides which if consumed more will lead to chronic cholesterol elevation and fatty liver, heart ailments... go for non oily foods

7454 2018-01-03 07:30:30 After depriving my face of moisture for almost a year bc of an irrational fear of store bought lotions, I can officially say that jojoba oil saved my life y’all
7455 2018-01-03 07:30:24 Besides, the electoral college didn't choose a 71 year old guy weighing 300 lbs with yellow hair because they thought he was packing heat, they chose him because they thought he'd keep oil prices high and get rid of the estate tax.
7456 2018-01-03 07:30:23 Looks plausible to me.
7457 2018-01-03 07:29:59 Oh tinmanbot, you need some oil. The Wiz will give you a heart. Oh wait, the Wiz is black. You’re screwed...

7467 2018-01-03 07:28:43 Is this something that oil companies are paying secretly, to mollify indigenous protests re their pipeline plans? (Even if there were NO lawyers to pay, it's $30 grand or so each... in a time when persons have gotten millions for hot coffee in their lap.) words FAIL me  ^..^

7469 2018-01-03 07:28:26 Mossadegh was ELECTED by the people of iran---was secular, democratic, and wanted to nationalize the oil. The Shah conspired with foreign governments to overthrow him, and committed treason. He has his fool followers still, but Iranians don't forget #iranprotest #fucktheshah
7470 2018-01-03 07:28:25 This is exactly what Trump wants. Encouraging all white country with Natives living on reservations, their  land being drilled for oil, other people of color living in the high rent ghettos of the big cities, or homeless.

No one is going to war. No one will be slaughtering children in your name. Now move along and enjoy some pop news.
7473 2018-01-03 07:27:01 Seems like the same reason Libya was attacked, why Venezuela is being attacked, Syria and now Iran. The western oil companies aren't being allowed to exploit the resources like they used to and they're mad. Among other reasons of course but this seems to be a common thread.

7484 2018-01-03 07:24:49 It's BS here for 'full serve' mandated gas stations in some municipalities. They jus pump gas. One of my first jobs was at one n we checked oil, tire pressure, topped up fluids, etc

7494 2018-01-03 07:23:24 It is correct and as most offshore gas is produced in English waters it proves that the Union is not about oil and gas.

7497 2018-01-03 07:22:46 Let’s break it down. Oil prices have become helpful to growth because America is the 3rd largest producer. In general increasing commodity prices caused inflation which is the usual catalyst for recessions. Low inflation did help stocks and the economy in 2017.

7521 2018-01-03 07:18:32 That's really true, our youth are unemployed and we are poor, we are poor because our country instead of treating us with Iraq, Syria and Yemen, our oil money is being used by Palestine, and we are heading for the streets to fight Israel instead of the Palestinians.
7522 2018-01-03 07:18:23 No structure is perfect.countries have made good on parliamentary, presidential  and other systems..some countries with oil have developed...our issues are moral and character oriented and the earlier we focus on admitting and esolving them,we will run from excuse to excuse..
7523 2018-01-03 07:17:59 If you're an oil trader, you get paid for being right, so I wouldn't go that way. We could go back to fewer bidders to make it more sporting, I suppose. But you're all wrong anyway so don't sweat it.

7531 2018-01-03 07:17:01 What say you of ghost companies lifting Nigeria's crude oil, companies whose names isn't registered with the CAC. Who owns those companies, who cleared them for lifting? The NNPC GMD gives contracts to those companies to lift. Who is then to blame?

7553 2018-01-03 07:12:12 Price hike was bigger on US reserves news; price hike was bigger on news of ARAMCO flotation. Iranian news is a blip, there will be rises and falls over market news, which is proof again how insignificant North Sea oil/gas is in world supplies

7562 2018-01-03 07:11:08 So why aren't we seeing greater investment into AB, or more companies wanting to work here? There are many other cheaper places for oil now and Alberta is falling behind its competition. It's not hard for the NDP to claim growth in oil and gas after the huge fall in oil

7564 2018-01-03 07:10:37 It's not the size of the find, it's how much is recoverable at a profit. The answer to that is that there is only a small part of it that is. You are also confusing quantity of oil/gas with the price, which is set by markets NOT the SNP

7570 2018-01-03 07:10:03 Cool map. Not sure you realize Arabistan is the area with most of Iran's on shore oil and gas reserves.
7571 2018-01-03 07:09:51 The determinants of domestic price of petrol par litre include,  the rate at which Naira is exchanged for dollar which is used to purchase the refined products at the international market, the prevailing price the oil is sold there & finally how much is added to gain some profit.

7577 2018-01-03 07:09:01 Oh please, just keep telling yourself and all your friends at the dinner party how bad off we are.  You’ll go along your merry way telling everyone how to live.  We need coal, and oil, and gas, and without it, we go back to the Stone Age. Give us all a break.

7579 2018-01-03 07:08:41 Alberta’s Oil and Gas sector isn’t “dead” and it is certainly not being “killed” we saw growth in all sectors INCLUDING oil and gas last year and it is likely to continue into this year!
7580 2018-01-03 07:08:39 anyways if anyone wants to give me a hug tomorrow my only plans are i have to get my oil changed at 3, so my schedules pretty open
7581 2018-01-03 07:08:08 年始セールでなんか買うかな〜
7582 2018-01-03 07:07:57 Oh and the greedy rich oil companies will just raise their prices higher in a cash cow crab!
7583 2018-01-03 07:07:56 And yet the population living in places where these oil companies suck the oil from are living in extreme poverty. No good infrastructure, nothing all. So wake up it’s  a blaming game

7592 2018-01-03 07:05:33 Time to move to Whothehellknows, where survivability in a nuclear war is higher than 0%. I hope potatoes and vegatable oil grow there.
7593 2018-01-03 07:05:31 Chemical engr nko? Oil money
7594 2018-01-03 07:05:24 Perhaps that is why Trump BFF Putin is doing his darndest to make sure NORK gets their oil around the international embargo.....and Trump says nothing. Yet, China ships some oil to NORK and he's all thumbs on Twitter.
7595 2018-01-03 07:05:24 You can't stop the flow of a commodity by increasing the price. What about carbon capture technologies? And in the process of "diversifying" our economy you're killing our oil and gas sector which is still crucial to prolonged prosperity in AB.

7643 2018-01-03 06:58:19 Oil was the only reason? The government had nothing to do with it? Yeah that oil lead to the same problem in Saudi Arabia too, huh? Now please stop whining to me. Do you know how to agree to disagree? Let it go little one.

7653 2018-01-03 06:56:06 This is why there was the Syrian war as Assad had no need for "foreign aid/money".  He gave his citizens free education, medical care for life. This is why the zionists wanted this war and also to get their hands on Golan Heights oil, which they are still trying to do now.
7654 2018-01-03 06:55:42 My oil diffuser is my favorite thing on earth
7655 2018-01-03 06:55:19 The spread is pretty consistant regardless of the price of oil until 2015 when capital  fled AB along with the potential royalty revenue.  The other way to look at it is that despite having historically average total per capita revenues the NDP still went massively into debt.

7685 2018-01-03 06:50:08 Well this is your opinion. Unfortunately it is far from the truth.

7696 2018-01-03 06:48:24 The "transport differential" has been a non-economic but political factor in  the oil industry which has weakened the service delivery system The transport differential subsidy should be abolished to encourage competition in the delivery  system of the industry
7697 2018-01-03 06:47:27 "Another rule that would be removed requires third-party inspectors of equipment,"
So they are going to be responsible for inspecting their own equipment.  lol you can trust the big oil companies to do the right thing right?  They wouldnt cut corners to save money would they. SMH

7871 2018-01-03 06:19:22 coconut oil is super comedogenic n too thick to be absorbed by you skin/hair and st ives (specifically the apricot scrub) is too abrasive, though most physical exfoliators are. it's best to use a chemical exfoliator instead.

8026 2018-01-03 05:55:10 True . That's something I will never understand. But I think it's because there are a lot of resources (oil) that are important for the u.s. and elsewhere. That's why they are accepting the dozens of dead people there. And it's a shame.
8027 2018-01-03 05:55:08 The Liberal government could definitely improve the way it has handled a number of environmental and social issues: from waste exports to IP's water to oil pipelines, it has certainly not been a glowing track record to date. Hope to see it improve.

8144 2018-01-03 05:36:37 No. China & Russia were both trading oil. The reason for talks is that Trump has alienated the #SouthKorea public so fully by not giving a shit about them that US ejection from a unified Korea & serious China & Russia help is now a possibility.

8177 2018-01-03 05:31:27 shah came after the coup. iran was a constitutional monarchy. so people voted for mossadegh during mohammad reza shah's rule. he curbed the shah's power and iran became democratic for a while. he nationalized iran's oil and britain's didn't like that. so they staged a coup
8178 2018-01-03 05:31:25 Department of Energy obliges oil companies to submit how much of their inventories are from 2017; added that oil companies cannot increase price for 2017 inventories for these are not yet subject to the new excise tax.

8185 2018-01-03 05:30:28 The British are now using more renewable energy, and burning less coal than anytime in their history! We have created more jobs in solar energy, the in the coal, oil, or gas industry combined!
8186 2018-01-03 05:30:27 yeah it's definitely not from the clamp. coulda been thermal cycled too deep, maybe the coolant mixture didn't have enough antifreeze, maybe a seal failed from thermal cycling...engine still turns and has good oil pressure. but we ain't getting back to TX in it.

8196 2018-01-03 05:29:00 My mother-in-law loves it. I do not. The first sip is deceiving - you’ll think it tastes like vacation. But then it lingers like bad coconut oil.
8197 2018-01-03 05:28:50 Look at it! Your government did it! The sovereignty of other states does not interest you. You are only interested in oil and dollars ...
8198 2018-01-03 05:28:42 I’m diffusing an oil mix to boost my mood, but it’s not working and I’m even more annoyed than before 
8199 2018-01-03 05:28:38 Chia really has done nothing.  Todd can’t find anything.  New blood that’s all that will turn this around.
8200 2018-01-03 05:28:27 I just braid it every now and then. I use main n tail, Cantu, bella curls and I wear a lot of wings. Oh and I oil it often and spray it with water almost every day and for one month I ate sugar bear hair vitamins, and I have this water and vitamin mix I spray on it, natural herbs

8209 2018-01-03 05:27:07 Yup! 5000-10000 IU daily. Don’t be afraid of the big amounts. I’ve also found a vitamin B complex and fish oil to be helpful.

8262 2018-01-03 05:19:52 Probably my fav part of being a girl is taking a shower to get the oil out of my hair, then afterwards immediately rubbing oil into my hair
8263 2018-01-03 05:19:49 So what happened to crushing those Pacific teams

8291 2018-01-03 05:17:33 In fairness it's up to the head coach to decide to throw the 2017 PK structure out the window and start from scratch.  Assistants to implement a newline.  Regardless, it's a fucking travesty.  Special teams are WHY Oil near last rather than near first.

Purpose is ending illegal immigration, not accommodating those here now.
8298 2018-01-03 05:16:25 Sehari makan cuma sekali, no meat, no dairy, kalau bisa no oil. Minum cuma air putih / teh hangat no gula. Itu aja kok.
8299 2018-01-03 05:16:09 3. Give yourself a nice coconut oil rub down before bed. This also helps me relax before bed and keeps my skin soooo soft and smooth. I wake up with a glow.
8300 2018-01-03 05:16:01 My eyelashes are so long that they leave little oil marks on my eyeglasses causing them to be dirty 24/7. So ladies, long lashes aint all that.

Hope everyone else had a wonderful Day 2 of 2018! The team is back up to full force after some of us got lost in Santa's bag of toys - all the love to @LayerOneThom @SantaDevs & @J3d247 for burning the midnight oil for all our wonderful users. Rockstars!

8305 2018-01-03 05:15:43 go oil
8306 2018-01-03 05:15:41 Game altered when Puljujarvi hit post. If he scores the play is over. Later in shift Maroon hits Doughty then Oil give up 3 on PK. Crazy how one play changed course of game so quickly.
8307 2018-01-03 05:15:34 Yup
8308 2018-01-03 05:15:25 Same. Also its never been as bad as weight loss related homeopathic garbage, but I do still get random "stop taking ADHD meds, they're poison! Try these cod liver oil tablets, jogging and sleeping more, that'll cure you 'ADHD' right up, you'll thank me later." BS suggestions.
8309 2018-01-03 05:15:21 all i can think about is that one girl who got stuck in a coconut oil bath cause it hardened and all i just imagined you getting stuck in a tub of hardened oil and being like “well shit”

8341 2018-01-03 05:10:47 Of course it will but they can't continue like this. While you & I can't see them coming back & haven't for some time, that can't be the mindset on the bench.
8342 2018-01-03 05:10:37  Flim flammed through the whole mess like 2 angry snake oil salesmen.  But, ahhhhh, the pigment, the tap dancing, and the promise of health, wealth and free rides for cheats & thugs - how could you not love them?  (No one is better off-should have stayed in the bathhouses!)
8343 2018-01-03 05:10:34 This year, I will not eat popcorn almost every night. Yes I make it with vegan butter and coconut oil and nutritional yeast and it’s fiercely delicious, but you have to draw a line somewhere right? Saaaay...3 times per week to start? #resolutions

8355 2018-01-03 05:09:05 I did too much shit today especially with getting an oil change on both of my cars.
8356 2018-01-03 05:08:57 I am at pain the way things are going in Nigeria.  How can a crude oil producing  country  with four Refinery could  fall to this level, where we have to buy fuel   at #250 per litre.
8357 2018-01-03 05:08:56 Can’t say in the decade of darkness I ever had a frustration level this high with the oil.

8359 2018-01-03 05:08:25 The Japanese weren't thinking about defeating the US in attacking PH. They knew US's industrial might as their admiral had studied at Harvard. It was a delaying tactic to fortify their Pacific gains so that it would be costly for US to attempt to dislodge then. And to get to oil.
8360 2018-01-03 05:08:25 Isn’t he like 20-3-5 lifetime vs oil. Him playing the oilers and getting LA a point at least is as close to a guarantee in hockey as anything right about now. Second to a team scoring a powerplay goal in edmonton.
8361 2018-01-03 05:08:20 Nothing else to do but treat it as a development year. If wins aren't the objective, there are other players can can still gain.
8362 2018-01-03 05:08:02 Starting 2018 on a v responsible adultish way by getting an oil change.
8363 2018-01-03 05:08:00 Agreed but until they're ready to accept it, they can't continue with this. Serves no purpose.
8364 2018-01-03 05:07:38 This is also a trade I will skew a bit if oil moves to an extreme position such as low 40's. I will keep puts closer to strike and widen the call side. I have made oil my "Karen the supertrader" trade technique.. Just not so far out delta... 10-16 delta distance tops.
8365 2018-01-03 05:07:34

8411 2018-01-03 05:03:03 Or maybe he could lead by example.   No cheating on the pk. He’s accountable as well.
8412 2018-01-03 05:02:55 The increase in price has more to do with the value of the dollar than supply-demand cycles. Most commodities are trending upwards. Lots of negative headwinds for oil, US-Shale production as they are already drilled and ready for prod, as well as aggressive trends towards EV's.
8413 2018-01-03 05:02:54 Apparently one big problem with certifying CBD for treatment is they have no idea what the proper dosage is, and because the oil isn't water soluble, they can't guarantee how much gets into the blood system. 

Again. Where proper testing would come in handy.

8445 2018-01-03 04:58:14 Is there anything we can do to get @TeamYouTube @YouTube to stop hosting @tailopez as an advertiser? 9/10 videos I watch start with me having to watch that smarmy weasel attempt to sell snake oil.
8446 2018-01-03 04:57:47 Thank you
8447 2018-01-03 04:57:45 I worked in Alaska on the oil pipeline. Good news for Union construction workers like me. Native American Alaskans get their medical care paid for from the Oil revenue.  Liberal's fail to mention that. Go Trump!

Good thing you struck up such a great deal with China to stop sending them oil. They really fear you.....hahaha hahaha!!!!!

8474 2018-01-03 04:54:00 All products that are sold in states that have medicinal laws have clear and concise rules that are followed. For example in the state of Florida CBD oil is legal to purchase over the counter to adults 18 & over.

8477 2018-01-03 04:53:43 The picture is similar globally, but I know the US data best, which is why I started there. Oil just isn't a big factor in electricity generation, except in island nations and some other niche markets.

8483 2018-01-03 04:52:38 The soft attacks on Iran have already begun. Iran is crumbling socially, now. But Iran is still not ruled by the Western Bankers -yet. Their western puppet armies have been probing. Two goals are depopulate Iran through war and steal Natural Gas & oil.

8492 2018-01-03 04:51:51 Yeah, the choice between Saudi light oil which floats if it leaks and is easier to clean up; or tar sands heavy oil which sinks to the bottom and is very hard to clean up.  See: Kalamazoo River spill for example.

8494 2018-01-03 04:51:35 I remember being happy when Gulf War 1 was over. Then a Navy mate of mine says "don't get too excited Kate, we'll be back within 10 years"
I asked what he meant.
"They want and NEED the oil. They haven't secured their control"
8495 2018-01-03 04:51:20 Oil is to water as deplorables are to facts. It's pointless.

8530 2018-01-03 04:46:54 My arthritic clients swear by fish oil, this is second hand information though, maybe it give you a direction to research. I have one client who gets acupuncture, she believes it helps remove excess ‘wind’ elements from her joint that ease her pain, hope this helped.

8535 2018-01-03 04:46:09 It’s not about what’s left on the ground when your done.  It’s the tons of CO2, oxides, and other pollutants burning hydrocarbons produce. Plus the extra pollution refining the tar sands heavy oil causes.

8550 2018-01-03 04:44:30 The American government overthrew and murdered Iran's democratically elected leader to get his country's oil and imposed the tyrannical Shah on the Iranian people. Then Carter's human rights agenda caused the Ayatollahs to take over the country.

8552 2018-01-03 04:44:20 Yup. A big fucking load of real shit with some chemicals on top. Coderre was in a good mood that day. But an oil spill would have been way far worst. Well, as we tought. And we still do.

Otherwise, how is your independance project doing?
8553 2018-01-03 04:44:17 It's like taking a new car off a lot. Deprecation. There's no telling when the last time the oil was changed, tires rotated, and a good under-carriage cleaning was done. No signs of rust, but I'm sure there's high-mileage. ;)

8600 2018-01-03 04:38:28 I shouldn’t have to wash my hair 15 times to get that oil out Hopefully it grew tho

8603 2018-01-03 04:37:56 For the good of the game, long-term. There are volumes of studies on concussions that say you can’t assess one in 10 minutes. Nor should you try.
8604 2018-01-03 04:37:55 Got everyone . FB 
8605 2018-01-03 04:37:49 change your own oil dude! you save so much!!
8606 2018-01-03 04:37:48 エルダースクロール特有のガバ翻訳に声を当ててしまった感じがすこ
8607 2018-01-03 04:37:37 Same as the people in Puerto Rico, why help them they don’t have any oil
8608 2018-01-03 04:37:22 Ogx curling cream/butter or even coconut oil at the end of your curls!
8609 2018-01-03 04:37:19 It reminds me of Desert storm just before Saddam Hussein was losing his country he tried burning it to the ground by blowing up all of his oil wells. Jerry Brown trying to destroy the state before losing it back to CONSERVATIVES.
8610 2018-01-03 04:36:50 Technically not, because to be wet, it needs to be saturated or covered with water, so in this case, the oil would be the one considered wet
8611 2018-01-03 04:36:36 Yeah back then they were telling us  the worlds oil supply would soon be gone. Humph we are using 88ish million barrels a day x 42 gallons a barrel. That's a lot in a year isn't it
8612 2018-01-03 04:36:24 use black seed oil, it’s helps with growing hair
8613 2018-01-03 04:36:22 If that's the case, take off Oil tinted glasses
8614 2018-01-03 04:36:22 it's probably been a really long time since a War was about anything other than Fossil Fuel, Oil, Gold or Uranium.
8615 2018-01-03 04:36:17 One thing i can add to using coconut oil is the clean up in a breeze compared to washing lube off...
8616 2018-01-03 04:36:11 I'm a believer in magnesium oil spray for my sore knee joints and ankles too. It is really helping
8617 2018-01-03 04:36:08 DOE: excise tax changes on oil should reflect on pump prices not earlier than Jan. 16, since firms are required to keep buffer stock good for at least 15 days @InquirerBiz

8619 2018-01-03 04:35:50 I have some for hair and some for skin. It’s a dense oil but it’s pretty bomb when you use it habitually
8620 2018-01-03 04:35:43 多分承認した！！！
8621 2018-01-03 04:35:25 Got y'all.

Grandson of a lowest rung Blackshirt Fascist Mussolini’s foot soldier wants to convert India into a castor oil bottles and batons country ruled by goons.

8641 2018-01-03 04:33:26 Done!!!!
8642 2018-01-03 04:33:14 So it's the NDP raising the price of oil/gas everyday and you think it's the UCPs fault on long weekends....weekends are easy to avoid but everyday means everyday you pay a jacked up price. Smarter is not the word you should use.
8643 2018-01-03 04:32:58 Do you MIND?! You look like a lunatic screaming about Nazis WHILE voting democrat! 

Suggestion. Get a humidifier, drop 5 drops clove oil, 5 drops sweet orange oil, and a dew drops pepperment or wintergreen oil, and plug that in. You'll feel better in a snap!
8644 2018-01-03 04:32:50 @BulldogSkincare what's the consistency of the oil control face wash/scrub? Are they gel or a cream?
8645 2018-01-03 04:32:49 Imagine you had to buy car ins for car washes, oil changes, and window tinting. So why all inclusive health ins? Be #selfish and think NO!
8646 2018-01-03 04:32:41 Greasy faced, I remember asking D for his oil sheets  fr, he probably doesn’t remember tho
8647 2018-01-03 04:32:33 Just make sure they actually changed your oil filter after you get done each time!!

8651 2018-01-03 04:32:15 @OfficeOfRG Your hatred against #BJP is not helping, if you can't appeal for peace then atleast don't put oil into fire. #MaharashtraBandh
8652 2018-01-03 04:32:14 well sure not put even more oil in the fire. i mean cmon...really? playing that "ive a bigger button than you" ? honestly its just immature
8653 2018-01-03 04:32:13 The most annoying thing for me is having to go get an oil change 
8654 2018-01-03 04:32:03 I hear you Rob ..
8655 2018-01-03 04:31:42 Got you all, if I missed anyone let me know, I got you too pilgrim
8656 2018-01-03 04:31:40 Artie.  Imma just gonna have to be blunt. You cant escape coal & oil. Its here, we're using itm mmm k? 99.99% of the people have accepted this reality already.

8660 2018-01-03 04:31:22 Might be. Will be intrigued to see how that's handled. I'm not defending maroon cuz he's Oil. Just my view of the hit itself.
8661 2018-01-03 04:31:07 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, yet Medicare.

8663 2018-01-03 04:30:46 Mashed cauliflower with garlic, olive oil, and cayenne pepper is pretty good too.  Not a vegan/vegetarian, but good is good.
8664 2018-01-03 04:30:43 Touche; I guess my angle was that while I broadly endorse technological optimism, some ideas are just *really bad* for some pretty basic reasons, because they defy reality, ignore trade-offs, etc. Being distracted by snake oil retards progress as much as negativity.
8665 2018-01-03 04:30:40 It's automatic and Doughty didn't even have the puck. If that's not called it's a miss from the ref.
8666 2018-01-03 04:30:38 
8667 2018-01-03 04:30:31 Right? I just bought some cocoa butter face oil. I’ll let you know how it works.
8668 2018-01-03 04:30:23 I put coconut oil on my eyelashes and I think i’m going blind
8669 2018-01-03 04:30:09 Got 2 mugs of Tea, an Olive Oil + Lemon Flush with a Scripture Challenge journal, that I haven't written in yet, right in front of my face. I'm ridding myself of this nonsense one way or another.
8670 2018-01-03 04:30:03 Yeah those oil companies raising gas prices just before Christmas sure care.
8671 2018-01-03 04:29:55 My new favorite bedtime ritual is to take a little #doTERRA eucalyptus oil or breathe and rub on my wrist before bed. Since I sleep with my wrist right at my nose all night it’s like a body diffuser #lifehack #icanbreatheagain #gettingoveracold
8672 2018-01-03 04:29:37 @SBakerMD Hey, Dr. Baker, you did a great job with the video today, addressing all the relevant issues being discussed on the Facebook page, like coconut oil and cheese, in your usual genuine, straightforward style.

8676 2018-01-03 04:28:42 @SimonSaidSo06 I spent lots of time Googling oil diffusers and asthma etc.  Would you have any research suggestions? I think oil defusers should be banned from classrooms but I can’t find an article supporting this view.

8678 2018-01-03 04:28:09 1st the oil marketing companies (that mostly supply fuel to private outlet owners) as well as SIAM are anti-electric vehicle. 2nd you need a large parking space within d existing fuel station infra sub as 2 charge. D first is common 2 d US, however d second is particular 2 India.

8681 2018-01-03 04:27:52 Our oceans might not be as polluted with plastic if we had invested in hemp instead of oil. Hemp plastic is 100% biodegradable, plastic made of oil is not. Cannabis was a backdoor war on the renewable resource ie hemp. Hemp filters the soil and air. It's time, to be honest.
8682 2018-01-03 04:27:51 She voted for this bill. People will die due to her act. Warren voted for people to die in wars for oil, opiods, minerals.... This is not acceptable. Except to those who don't mind permanent war and what it does to its victims.

8708 2018-01-03 04:24:44 Yes.  Why do we apologize for having oil backed by the best environmental and human rights record?

8717 2018-01-03 04:23:47 The Globalists planned on using Iran for military purposes in the oil rich ME. Also chaos is their tool for making money. A peaceful and prosperous Iranian population won’t further their plans. BHO is a believer in the cause.
8718 2018-01-03 04:23:47 for sure but lets be honest the Oil dont do shit on the PP so whatever. I'll be shocked if they kill off the 5 min PP.
8719 2018-01-03 04:23:44 You've got the wrong beard oil!  And/or you left it in direct sunlight far too long and it spoiled...
8720 2018-01-03 04:23:38 Before oil became a commodity, the Middle East was a wasteland with a few pockets of “civilized” life with economies based strictly on slavery. Life expectancy was worse than Minneapolis in January.

8737 2018-01-03 04:21:52 Hate the stigma between alcohol and weed. You take a $30 dab worth of oil and youre a bad ass stoner. But if you drink a $30 half gal its "stop peeing on my dog wtf are you doing"
8738 2018-01-03 04:21:51 I miss full service! Didn't know some places still have it. " can I check your oil today Miss?" ..." You bet!"
8739 2018-01-03 04:21:50 
8740 2018-01-03 04:21:43 That's why it cost so much. That damn marula oil is $70 lol.
8741 2018-01-03 04:21:41 Sorry theuresa I thought the same person commented twice lol.

Yes. The scientists bought and paid for by the oil industry to say climate change is fake, are very wrong.
Do your own research. Why would you believe 1% of scientists when the rest agree its happening??? How stupid!
8742 2018-01-03 04:21:38 UFA next yr. Having a back to reality season this yr. Taking dumb penalties all yr. Would be shocked beyond shocked If he finishes the season In Edm.
8743 2018-01-03 04:21:33 I keep trying to come up with a slick joke about oil but they all keep coming up crude. I'm hoping to refine them.

8750 2018-01-03 04:21:05 False premise. Oil prices turned BEFORE Trump was elected. The add on since is so incremental as to be a disappointment really, relative to where the high was.
8751 2018-01-03 04:20:54 Wellington is broken. 
My coconut oil, kept in the coldest room in my cold house, has liquefied
8752 2018-01-03 04:20:45 I think they make oil, mobile phones etc.
8753 2018-01-03 04:20:43 China was caught supply oil to NK.  How does that destroy NK?
8754 2018-01-03 04:20:38 I’m so over this cold .. put some oil in my diffuser, praying it works!

8768 2018-01-03 04:18:41 It would be nice if you get in touch with Oil & Gas team in Cairn India.
8769 2018-01-03 04:18:27 Is the essential oil diffuser I got for Christmas supposed to make me sneeze uncontrollably? What am I doing wrong? It's like I snorted it or something. Someone help me.
8770 2018-01-03 04:18:26 @elonmusk In response to the Texas car dealership cartel, why not open a Tesla showroom in Ardmore, OK? Just north of Texas, home to a tire plant and Big Oil. @Tesla-loving Texans can take a short drive to order the best cars on the planet. Just a thought. #tesla #elonmusk

8774 2018-01-03 04:18:02 I need my humidifier and oil diffusers to get here like right now...
8775 2018-01-03 04:17:51 And that oil is so far down (like 1000s of miles beneath the earth’s core) that no equipment can drill that far. It’s also trapped in oil shale and tech just isn’t that developed. #readafuckingreport
8776 2018-01-03 04:17:26 What is cannabis oil?  I have neuropathy in hands and feet and can’t take drugs, just Tylenol.
8777 2018-01-03 04:17:24 You're making me want to take a coconut oil bath stoppit
8778 2018-01-03 04:17:21 Also! A bag of defrosted but not warmed chopped broccoli + sesame oil + teaspoon of chili garlic sauce = surprisingly good. #lazykitchen
8779 2018-01-03 04:17:10 Having rent due and needing an oil change in the same week... yikes I’m broke
8780 2018-01-03 04:17:09 even cocnut oil is good
8781 2018-01-03 04:16:56 If you use grinded coffee beans mixed with coconut oil it’ll help faster and you can use it as an exfoliator
8782 2018-01-03 04:16:51 I like groundnut oil
8783 2018-01-03 04:16:50 Nope but it is strong. Stings for the 1st 5 secs then it’s fine. Only supposed to leave it on for 20 mins and my face is smooth and soft after. It came with some marula oil and i use a little after.

8802 2018-01-03 04:15:30 I think I also melted it into coconut oil sometimes for spreadability over area, but on its own it's the thing for any cracked, raw or chapped skin.
8803 2018-01-03 04:15:30 Make that *millions* of years  Also, you have to have oil to keep drilling for it, running equipment, and transporting it. So yeah, it’s gonna runout. #smarterthanafifthgrader

8854 2018-01-03 04:10:15 Lots of mariners know 'ullage', as it refers to the empty head space above liquid level in any storage tank - fuel, water, lube oil, sewage, whatever.

Same basic meaning as the winemakers' term, but applied to much larger containers. :-_

8860 2018-01-03 04:09:39 We should have taken Iran's oil. We could lower the gas prices and help save money for our crunchy roll subscriptions.
8861 2018-01-03 04:09:38 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
8862 2018-01-03 04:09:36 I do miss having gas station attendants. They did other stuff, too, like checking oil and cleaning windshields. Air pressure on tires. Good services.
8863 2018-01-03 04:09:23 i smell like peppermint because the massage was with peppermint oil and it’s so soothing
8864 2018-01-03 04:09:14 She left in it or let it sit and rinse it out ? It’s probably good heated like a hot oil treatment
8865 2018-01-03 04:08:56 Believe nothing this "new" anti-science EPA says. They are about chemicals, oil drilling, and fracking. Taking us backward in time when rivers and fields were polluted by dumping. No science then either.
8866 2018-01-03 04:08:49 Reform simply means those who allocate the money (Khamenie et al) to stop stealing the oil revenues to enrich themselves and those who feed at Khameni's trough. Do you see Khameni et al stopping their theft on their own?? Thieves are not reformable  on their own. 1/2
8867 2018-01-03 04:08:45 My pain from Degenerative disc disease is about 85% contained thanks to THCA cannabis oil and certain strains of #MMJ flower. I can't take anything else for my pain since I'm allergic to NSAIDS  and aspirin. I'm tired of hearing you uninformed people spewing BS propaganda.

8884 2018-01-03 04:07:12 After watching #DeepwaterHorizon it's horrific that the Trump administration wants to roll back the safety regulations for offshore oil rigs. If you think it is so expensive, use the damn tax money to fund it. If you want more lives lost, then go right ahead. #LivesOverMoney
8885 2018-01-03 04:07:07 You mean like rolling regulations back so the fines are less severe when nursing homes abuse their patience and making it less safe for the people who drill for oil pulling back on safety regulations that kind of really good stuff

Turmeric/essential oils/cannabis oil/ginger and honey/mistletoe/teas are not going to save my life.

Hey...I rhymed....
8893 2018-01-03 04:06:11 I told workers at Suncor back when oil dropped too $26 a barrel the project would shut down. The fear in the eyes was laughable!
8894 2018-01-03 04:06:05 List them... all I see as “accomplishments” are a record number of EOs, deregulation of EPA for the best interest of oil companies, denial of climate change, appointing unqualified federal judges, and stealing $1.5 trillion from middle class to the upper 1%... #fraud

8908 2018-01-03 04:04:57 I just watched a girl use the gel from the actual plant mixed with black castor oil to moisturize her hair. It looked silllky
8909 2018-01-03 04:04:40 Russia not helping in Syria, Russia selling North Korea oil, Russia buzzing our military aircraft, Russia supporting Iran regime,  oh yeah, they colluded to help trump.  
8910 2018-01-03 04:04:40 More so, why would you want to? Olive oil as a drink???? You're mad!
8911 2018-01-03 04:04:35 Kassian with a decent effort on a wrap around. Oil seems to be turning up some heat halfway in the 2nd... puck’s gotta go in at some point. #LetsGoOilers

8918 2018-01-03 04:04:04 Hope you got the right answer for China SUPPLYING NORTH KOREA with oil! I really believe CHINA wants them to have nuclear weapons! I further believe CHINA is working with RUSSIA & maybe IRAN to become SUPER POWER. I hope you get this right!

8922 2018-01-03 04:03:51 Coming in March 2018, Zinke offers biggest oil & gas lease sale in US history - nearly 77 million acres of federal waters in Gulf of Mexico will be avail for exploitation to highest bidder, courtesy of GOP. #VoteThemOut
8923 2018-01-03 04:03:48 I take the other side. UUP was a trade many years ago. 10 Trillion in the Dollar Yen Trade alone set to unwind. Cantor Fitzgerald was targeted because of the strong dollar policy that blew up weaker Countries. (Oil Producers)
8924 2018-01-03 04:03:39 I love chili oil! (*ﾉ▽ﾉ)
I could just drink it straight from the bottle!
8925 2018-01-03 04:03:30 Whatcha think? Should I log on chaturbate tonight? Who will cum around and watch an oil show???
8926 2018-01-03 04:03:28 Leave it to me to get peppermint essential oil on my fingers...and then rub my nose! Thank goodness it wasn't my eyes! #essentialoils #natural #oildiffuser #health

8931 2018-01-03 04:02:49 consumption; the amount of oil, electricity etc that is used
8932 2018-01-03 04:02:35  looking at macro, do u think it’s really sustainable due widening deficit, more govt borrowing & rising oil prices..import does get cheaper, bt v import a lot f white goods(other than petro), unsure if it wud really give a boost to dom manuf..more reforms wd certainly help..
8933 2018-01-03 04:02:34 definitely buildable, you can also dilute it with a little extra moisturizer which I do pretty often. Almond oil has also been a go-to after showers for my dryness as well.
8934 2018-01-03 04:02:33 Got er done!

8938 2018-01-03 04:02:15 Avoid the high sugar low protein yogurt and nut milk. Try a bunch until you find one you like. Invest in a milk frother if you like frothy milk. Start buying bigger bottles of olive oil. I like TJs organic or tiger brand from Rainbow in SF.
8939 2018-01-03 04:02:03 Low IQ45 #DonaldTrump did away with the regulations on Off Shore Oil Rigs that prevents another Deep Water Horizon, and the Regulations on Nursing Homes that prevent Elder Abuse over the Holiday Weekend.
8940 2018-01-03 04:02:02 The lip scrub i use is sugar, coconut oil, a little lemon juice & honey, rub it on your lips then let It rest for a couple minutes, then wash it off, follow with chapstick or something. This scraps off dead skin. I also brush my lips with vaseline once a week to lighten them.
8941 2018-01-03 04:01:49 Thank you Stu for speaking the truth: “Just because you live in the sport performance world doesn’t mean you have to buy the crap that others in the industry are putting out”                 Too much snake oil.... not enough elbow grease.
8942 2018-01-03 04:01:49 Seriously don't understand why they don't have Nuge on right half wall where he normally is and JP on left half wall looking for one-timer. Maroon in front with Strome at bumper...
8943 2018-01-03 04:01:47 @oil_markets thanks for the RT.
8944 2018-01-03 04:01:46 ahhh that’s not fun at all :-( maybe look for a fragrance-free cream, you could try something like pure aloe or tea tree oil to soothe the burning too. i hope it gets better soon!

8951 2018-01-03 04:00:58 In yet MORE evil attacks on the very lives of lower, middle, working class Americans the @realDonaldTrump administration just gutted safety regulations that protect the lives of oil rig workers AND eased penalties against #NursingHomes that abuse &/or neglect residents.
8952 2018-01-03 04:00:54 Do you Pre Poo?? I DO! 
I pre poo with Coconut, tea tree, rosemary and olive oil.
8953 2018-01-03 04:00:39 Just reported on @TheLastWord @Lawrence Trumps sneaky administration cut fines on nursing homes on mistreatment of patients or place them in grave situations. Also they reduced oil rig safety regulations putting workers in more dangerous situations+possibly environmental damage
8954 2018-01-03 04:00:38 So Saudi dollars speaking. Seems like they had enough with lower oil prices. US has no morality anymore.
8955 2018-01-03 04:00:29 FFS, awards are not threats and people surely did not die for MSNBC, CNN and FAUX to exist... I mean come on, it's usually for oil or some other resource, the high flatulent BS about freedom is just the gimmick to get them to do it.
8956 2018-01-03 04:00:27 He's angry because Russia gave North Korea oil.

Es finito
Unos pocos tiene casi el 50%.
Es anonimo
Es volatil
Es posible que exista una especie de "arbitraje infinito", con un poquito de manipulacion
Que pasa si 100 personas anonimas tiene 90% del petroleo mundial y opera futuros de oil?

8966 2018-01-03 03:58:46 I drank a whole bottle of essential oil I am cancer proof
8967 2018-01-03 03:58:46 I dont think you quite understand what all oil is used for. Thats exactly what would happen. No more food unless you garden
8968 2018-01-03 03:58:37 Oil companies using up higher wages and  Tax cuts. Increase profits. Corporate America so predictable
8969 2018-01-03 03:58:37 Yeah because they're too busy working out how to do oil paintings of you, SORRY
8970 2018-01-03 03:58:33 เป็นหนังที่ดูแล้วกดดันมาก กูดูแล้วก็แบบมึ๊งงงง เครียดตาม5555555
8971 2018-01-03 03:58:31 Our environmental consequences are great and our white house doesn't understand that as all they think about is their rich friends and lowering costs for oil and gas by letting pollution occur.  It may be up to states to counter-act this and stop it completely.
8972 2018-01-03 03:58:23 Schizophrenic Trump just lessened REGULATIONS on OFF SHORE OIL DRILLING PLATFORMS. More workers dying, more oil spilled. MINING NOW ALLOWED IN MINNESOTA CANOE WLIDERNESS. Federal Government GUTTED. Nursing Homes now Protected even when guilty of ABUSING PATIENTS PER SENILE DJT
8973 2018-01-03 03:58:23 So you'll need an oil can? How do you not have any eye rusties.
8974 2018-01-03 03:58:20 Like pollution from other kinds of oil extraction. Visit any oil town in PA and smell the water. That isn't from fracking, it was always that way.
8975 2018-01-03 03:58:17 I highly suggest getting an oil diffuser and using lemongrass oil in it. It’s amazing.
8976 2018-01-03 03:58:13 Is oil painting a form of earthbending?
Spray painting airbending?
:D
8977 2018-01-03 03:58:11 Stay on the case, and keep pouring the castor oil of reality down the throats of liberal media and their running dogs of progressive thought-control - but as free Americans our thoughts won't and can't be controlled!

8980 2018-01-03 03:57:56 America is about to apply the same Libyan script on Iran. Why is America quest for oil so insatiable.
8981 2018-01-03 03:57:51 I'm not sure fracking fluid counts as life force so much as it does coconut oil.

9005 2018-01-03 03:55:55 btw another trick Trump pulled for all you beach lovers he eased restrictions for OIL RIGS drilling in the OCEAN & also if you have a loved one in a nursing home he scaled back fines so if your love one gets hurt or is harmed the fines are minimal #donatedemocrat
9006 2018-01-03 03:55:54 Maybe some gas stations will remain full service-That’s what happened in my town yrs ago when self service law passed-They charge about 3cents>per gal-still go 2full service most of time-they clean windshield&rear window if u get a fill up&will  oil&tire pressure if u need it.

9046 2018-01-03 03:50:34 So in making homemade fries in oven ... using avocado oil cancels out the "fries are bad" stigma right?!?

9049 2018-01-03 03:50:13 I'll also add for context that the Notley govts embrace of new fossil fuel pipelines puts it outside the NDP family on this issue. The new BC NDP govt lead by John Horgan fiercely opposes the signature oil sands expansion policy: the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion.

9055 2018-01-03 03:49:14 why y’all only admire dark skin women when they’re 95% naked drenched in baby oil? lol pervs

9057 2018-01-03 03:49:05 @realDonaldTrump 2 roll back Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling regarding. Yes, this makes a lot of sense-NOT!! Just what we need; another oil rig disaster. How will that effect the environment?(right, U don’t care) What about the economy/stock market? (oh, your ears perked up.)

9059 2018-01-03 03:48:32 Homeless exist in every country. Iran is about as rich as MX, even accounting for oil wealth. Situation was far worse under monarchy.

9069 2018-01-03 03:46:53 Daniel changed my oil and bought me pupusas #Blessed
9070 2018-01-03 03:46:29 What's really crackers is that tRUmp's handler is providing oil and nuclear technology to the NK  loon who's playing chicken with our maniacal so-called Commander-in-Chief.
9071 2018-01-03 03:46:19 Some nicca got poured hot oil while taking a shit. He's dead.
9072 2018-01-03 03:46:10 He just called out Putin and Russia for selling oil to NK at sea. He also is providing weapons to Ukraine to fight Russian backed separatists. I am sure Putin doesn’t think Trump is being friendly.
9073 2018-01-03 03:46:07 Compelled to do a jungle greenery meets swampy river oil paint study
9074 2018-01-03 03:45:59 I just watched the video  It's egg whites, sugar, dissolved gelatin & vanilla extract...pipe onto any round cookie and coat with melted chocolate with some oil added...freeze to set before coating with chocolate and again after

9080 2018-01-03 03:45:07 Bath oil gotta be some of the best shit ever created lbvs .
9081 2018-01-03 03:45:02 Politicians are always like to take credit for things they had absolutly nothing to do with. I heard a politician take credit for the last oil boom in Texas.
9082 2018-01-03 03:44:52 It seems maybe new? I LOVE her oil free tinted moisturizer with SPF for summer too!
9083 2018-01-03 03:44:50 Just stay away from the others and stop stealing oil and butchering the blood just like what you did in Iraq and i promise you that nobody will give a shit abou your country or your president.

9087 2018-01-03 03:44:11 Congratulations!
Make sure you're no where near an oil rig with them 
9088 2018-01-03 03:44:09 But here is my substantive point. The AB NDP has a glaring, obvious, and movement breaking hole in its policy legacy: its passionate, forceful, serious, and continued advocacy on behalf of oil sands expansion and fossil fuel infrastructure.
9089 2018-01-03 03:44:03 Ghee/Coconut Oil best for cooking
9090 2018-01-03 03:43:57 This essential oil diffuser is literally the best thing that’s happened to me in a really long time. I might actually get a decent nights sleep. My best friend @runwayEscape is the best! 
9091 2018-01-03 03:43:54 said that right 
9092 2018-01-03 03:43:48 can someone get me one of those oil diffusers I would like to try one but the only thing in my pockets are lint

9094 2018-01-03 03:43:43 i have coconut oil on my face & justin just turned to me and started singing “baaabbbyyy you have shit on your face” in the tune of perfect by ed sheeran :/
9095 2018-01-03 03:43:26 Refer to @rejaniced about events like these, she's like a tea tree oil aficionado
9096 2018-01-03 03:43:26 I agree with Young the aninoted ones must be used, there should be a proper ceremony to anoint the priest the king so the oil rains down to the temple of God officially.
9097 2018-01-03 03:43:25 And Bear's Ears National Monument...taking the land for oil primarily.  He was the voice in the president's ear, and he took money from fossil fuel industry. And all of the above--well said.

9099 2018-01-03 03:43:03 Oil hits highest since mid-2015, then dips: LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Tuesday after hitting mid-2015 highs in early trading, as major pipelines in Libya and the UK restarted and U.S production soared to the highest in more than four decades.
9100 2018-01-03 03:42:51 That's not my understanding.  All NK now lacks is the time to mass produce. What I think we're doing by threatening Iran is to destabilize China's oil supply ahead of something terrible in NK.
9101 2018-01-03 03:42:47 How to determine your skin type: 
Gently pat a blotting paper on the different areas of your face. If the sheet picked up little to no oil, you most likely have dry skin. If the blotting sheet reveals oil from the forehead and nose areas, your skin is normal/combination.
9102 2018-01-03 03:42:42 Politicians in Texas have sworn they will never legalize marijuana, but they legalized CBD oil for seizures, so they’ve effectively admitted that weed has some medical use. I’m trusting in their love of money to trump their hatred of marijuana.
9103 2018-01-03 03:42:38 Pero hoy me cobraron $57 los lucky box. Y en ypf también. Oil hace lo que se le canta el pito y me cobra $60 (hasta la sem pasada)
9104 2018-01-03 03:42:28 LOL like my appliances are ducks recovering from an oil spill.
9105 2018-01-03 03:42:26 Mutually assured destruction. Everyone within 50 miles of an oil refinery dies.
9106 2018-01-03 03:42:08 Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque clarified that old oil inventories should not be subject to new excise taxes.
9107 2018-01-03 03:42:01 Tea tree oil & witch hazel do my skin so good
9108 2018-01-03 03:42:00 On my third one. Love it, but when the temp goes below about -2 or -3 Celsius the backup furnace kicks in (electric, gas, oil or whatever you have installed) and the heat pump can’t keep up. So great for moderate climates but only ground source is of any use in cold climates.
9109 2018-01-03 03:41:50 私もそんなことありました！

9110 2018-01-03 03:41:49 When T says, 'Deep State,' we need to assume he's deflecting from the one he's fronting. The Mercers & Kochs, Red-Map goal of 34 State to change constitution, more wealth inequality, court packing, (more)subjugation of immigrants+minorities & control of power=oil, seems DS to me!
9111 2018-01-03 03:41:33 right! let’s call our friends out working on GOM oil ris. dave bernard just said 12a-4a  such a let down from the beautiful December blizzard (in SW Mississippi where i was anyway)
9112 2018-01-03 03:41:32 My favorite life skill is knowing how to make salad dressings from scratch aka mixing vinegar and oil and...violá
9113 2018-01-03 03:40:44 Life Pro Tip: if you want your car to heat up quicker in the winter, just drain all of the oil from the car.

9117 2018-01-03 03:40:00 The military has to make that decision. Like everyone else I watch from a distance. But this effort has been excellent. I personally compare it to the Gulf of Mexico oil well blowout headed up by Thad Allen. Not as enormous, but a lot of good coordination and communication.

9124 2018-01-03 03:39:01 Everything. Is covered. In canola oil.
9125 2018-01-03 03:38:59 I say we get a large mud pit, put Trump and Kim Jong Un in diapers, oil them up, let them duke it out. Let Your countrymen live in peace - you two idiots go at it.
9126 2018-01-03 03:38:56 Please Don’t lecture us on morals. Clinton’s & morals are like water & oil. They don’t mix!
9127 2018-01-03 03:38:41 I swear, trying to plugs in your earlobes without lotion/oil is the equivalent of trying to do anal for the first time without lube.
9128 2018-01-03 03:38:40 Black RTV. Has the highest oil resistance. No need for high-temp stuff as the block and oil should never reach 500 degrees. If it does, I have other issues.

9137 2018-01-03 03:37:00 Are you using the right olive oil for your food? Virgin olive oil is most suited as a salad dressing while olive pomace oils are most suited for cooking purposes! #GoodToKnow
9138 2018-01-03 03:36:55 I feel like I need Vaseline then body butter then maybe some baby oil, topped off with a light dusting of crisco.

We include an organic hemp filter, all of our recipes are written by a holistic nutritionist & were super dope!
9150 2018-01-03 03:35:26 Looking good! What kind of sealant did you use on the oil separator?
9151 2018-01-03 03:35:20 #Chinese economy today is surviving on OBOR projects. The good days will end very soon as it is basically an enslaving initiative and not economic. End of oil wealth will also doom OBOR. #PM Modi's stand seem very much correct and well studied.

9158 2018-01-03 03:34:06 Hi Alli! Thank you for the help! The problem is that the oil is mostly not from my face - it comes from my scalp if I don't get a chance to wash my hair basically exactly every 24 hours (lol sorry for the new person TMI). So moisturizing can't fix it :\
9159 2018-01-03 03:34:00 That’s garbage. We support Mohammad bin Salman’s efforts to diversify the Saudi economy away from total dependence on oil and his efforts to make women a more equal part of Saudi society.
9160 2018-01-03 03:33:59 Sweden will take em out.

9170 2018-01-03 03:33:00 get the ass off the Iran's internal issues. once you failed to support rebellions in 1978 revolusion for the sake of oil, is over.
9171 2018-01-03 03:32:55 But that also benefits US gas/oil producers?! Also doesn't US frack capacity mean oil will not really surpass about $70 per barrel?  

My guess is 3 months from now will look very much like it does now net of some hard flapping butterflies.

9175 2018-01-03 03:32:39 Separate recreational use and CBD oil. Epilespy, MS, Parkinson's, Cancer. Unless you go after big alcohol, advocate for its illegalization. Go after big pharma for their ad increase, which neither can help people like CBD oil, it's hypocritical.

9182 2018-01-03 03:32:00 So they said they liked it, then oil prices tanked and money couldn't be spent on pedestrians. But in theory, in the future, we can roll the dates forward five years and fund it. Have I got that right?

9185 2018-01-03 03:31:41 Not necessarily. The Russian and US contributions are all excellent. I actually don’t know what #Yantar has other than the Panther Plus until #Malvinas returns, but people in the business respect what they do. The private sector has good stuff too, funded by oil and minerals.

9190 2018-01-03 03:30:45 I figure they needed to get rid of Rich because some az booster discovered oil or uranium and they didn't want to split the profits with him.

“It states China  North Korean government will not be allowed to collapse, and that Beijing plans to apply sanctions ‘symbolically’ to avoid punishing the regime of leader Kim Jong-un under a recent U.N. resolution requiring a halt to oil and gas shipments into North Korea.”
9199 2018-01-03 03:29:58 Sir, any updates on Sugar and Crude Oil as well?
9200 2018-01-03 03:29:47 Hi love, try getting some eucalyptus essential oil and mixing it with your body wash in the shower!! It helps my stuffy nose days 
9201 2018-01-03 03:29:38 If really a "cure" whether referred to as "alternative" to Standard of Care or as an "old home remedy" like rose hips or cod liver oil.
9202 2018-01-03 03:29:34 わかってしまう……。
9203 2018-01-03 03:29:34 That's so lame. That's what the Green Party said when they helped elect George W. Bush by giving Ralph Nader 70,000 votes in Florida in 2000. They said what difference does it make, they are the same. George W was an oil man and Gore was the greenest major candidate in history.
9204 2018-01-03 03:29:30 Sure it's not a catastrophic event until the pipes break. 3% is too much. Those protected places Monuments have been so for 100yrs & suddenly Trump magically makes it better? No. We have enuf oil. That's why gas continues to be low cost NOW.
9205 2018-01-03 03:29:22 He says some whack stuff for sure but people that are scared to death that a tweet will start a war are hilarious.I can’t even believe people think this way. They have no money, low food supply, & a lack of oil. But somehow they are going to reach the US with a nuke. Yeah ok.
9206 2018-01-03 03:29:21 Ok but I just bought a humidifier/essential oil diffuser/ Bluetooth speaker....my room is about to be cozy as fuck
9207 2018-01-03 03:29:09 We heat with oil....the price went up this year....I keep the house at 63 when I am the only one home and at night, 66 early morning and evenings.  But I wear a ling sleeve tee under a sweatshirt and slippers.  Today was a balmy 23 compared to the last few days of -5F
9208 2018-01-03 03:28:49 Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dum. These 2 are hell bent on "hitting the button" because they both claim to have the biggest rocket. Sanctions kicking in causing massive starvation in Nth Korea=No oil for winter heating. This is what happened to Japan in 1938ish=WW2=WW3 any minute!!!!!
9209 2018-01-03 03:28:49 My god are the Habs terrible...
9210 2018-01-03 03:28:34 Our Chevy Bolt is great. Sucks you still need gas and have that shitty oil change maintenance but oh well. Model 3 should arrive by summer. Waiting for dual motor all wheel drive.
9211 2018-01-03 03:28:26 Such baloney.  Daily exercise , organic food, good supplements, essential oils, vitamin D and fish oil is all you need. Ban vaccines&SSRIs.
9212 2018-01-03 03:28:17 now i wish i bought perfume or oil... the scent disappears very quickly 
9213 2018-01-03 03:28:14 Skincare Tip/Trick of the day: Showering with hot water removes the essential oil from your skin. These oils help keep the skin moisturized naturally. To avoid damage, limit the amount of time you bathe and opt for warm water instead of hot water.
9214 2018-01-03 03:28:09 Well, you do have to dispose of the oil properly, but I don't imagine that's all that enforceable.
9215 2018-01-03 03:28:06 わあ、一緒だね！

9218 2018-01-03 03:27:51 Why is not pot pain relief treated the same as the opiods for pain relief. Recreational use? It should be used for pain,Migraines.Used like Pain pills.Why do we not have tincture of oil.,Teas?
9219 2018-01-03 03:27:44 Anyone who says, "this will" is a fraud.  It CAN happen IF MbS is overthrown/killed and oil surges past $100/bbl.
9220 2018-01-03 03:27:24 Like

You know how when there's an oil spill and the cute little animals are dying?

You know how they fix the problem by dumping MORE oil on purpose?

9223 2018-01-03 03:27:06 Hey, now! Don’t forget the crooked @EPAScottPruitt and his own email scandal here in his home state Oklahoma! (Not to mention his PAC and campaign donations from Devon oil and other big oil/gas companies!), just want credit given where it’s due!
9224 2018-01-03 03:27:06 Ha! Let’s discuss something collaborative when we catch up for coffee oil a couple of weeks.
9225 2018-01-03 03:27:00 Not sure just trading them will impact oil prices to be honest. I believe a hint at acceptance as a viable currency would be impactful but like discussed, a currency must be stable, not volatile to be a driver of oil. Only way I see it. But I'm not arguing, just thinking out loud
9226 2018-01-03 03:26:37 Castor oil lagi hahaha
9227 2018-01-03 03:26:23 Good!! Hot oil spattering everywhere is scary AF 
9228 2018-01-03 03:26:20 Sunday Riley ufo oil smells putrid this shit better work
9229 2018-01-03 03:26:03 As stock market wobbles, job creation engine sputters, and even Mexico and Canada look for new trade partners, shorting USZ beef, oil and chemicals. You’re premature at best.
9230 2018-01-03 03:25:50 Read the article "Oil $80 a barrel because OPEC will continue to slash supply"... solution... more production by non-OPEC nations... cue Trump deregulation!!!
9231 2018-01-03 03:25:49 In need of oil
9232 2018-01-03 03:25:38 Wait wait wait... so he's basically a 21st century version of a Victorian-era snake oil salesman? By the way, that cure-all contains lead, arsenic, and opium. Have fun!!
9233 2018-01-03 03:25:19 Start wars to force oil prices up - it's the American way. I think it's in the Bill of Rights.

9236 2018-01-03 03:24:28 The former is easy to deal with, oil and elbow grease. The latter... is much tougher. And no longer only found on East and West coast.
9237 2018-01-03 03:24:14 Mihre's friend asked him to share the secret oil he is using to make his beard pop and he just pointed at me and said her pussy juice 
9238 2018-01-03 03:24:11 Nothing like coming home from a long winter production day; knowing you hit the gym, taking a hot shower, drinking some hot tea, lotioning up in some calm eucalyptus oil, listening 2 Anita Baker, and doing more work in a cozy Harlem home.  what up #2018 #allisgreat #thankyougod
9239 2018-01-03 03:24:10 Can’t trust those Russians: As part of the supply cut deal, Russia pledged to reduce its output by 300,000 bpd....
For the whole of 2017, however, Russian output rose to an average output of 10.98 million bpd, compared with 10.96 million bpd in 2016 and 10.72 million bpd in 2015
9240 2018-01-03 03:24:08 @StephanieKusie is a Conservative MP who believes in capitalism unless it doesn't serve her well.  Doesn't she know in supply and demand issues caused oil price collapse?  OVER SUPPLY MEANS LOWER PRICE PER BARREL. NO GOVERNMENT CONTROLS THE PRICE OF OIL.
9241 2018-01-03 03:23:57 Chris is the best! He had my car washed, the oil and filter changed, tires rotated and also filled up my gas tank! How did I get so freaking lucky?! 
9242 2018-01-03 03:23:56 @kaitlinmonte I don't have to do anything to winterize it except switch out to lighter viscosity oil...thick shit I use in summer becomes like molasses in the winter
9243 2018-01-03 03:23:49 The first one is very Nate Berkus. I really like them both but If you choose the second, perhaps more of like oil rubbed bronze hardware and more dark subtle accents (like the light fixture).

9251 2018-01-03 03:22:05 Chinese officials continue to supply North Korea with needed supplies such as oil and promise to give the dictatorial regime on its northeast border more nuclear missiles, according to a secret government document obtained by an American journalist and published Tuesday .

9264 2018-01-03 03:20:08 being an adult is so weird. the guys in front of me in line at Albertsons were having a serious debate about olive oil.
9265 2018-01-03 03:20:06 And THIS is why the Mexican government is in favor of illegal immigrants to the US. That's their second most profitable export behind oil.

9272 2018-01-03 03:19:13 I have essential oil spray.  They just decide not to use it.  And apparently they either have very foul smelling urine and need to cover up the scent, or are crazy.  Also one of the girls uses body spray instead of air freshener.  I just need my own private loo at work...

9275 2018-01-03 03:19:04 Filtered oil is best for health, which oil to eat depends on location and weather conditions, for e.g. people in Maharashtra and Gujarat should eat filtered groundnut oil. Never eat refined only, it’s causing high cholesterol and all diseases, be aware and safe than sorry.

9337 2018-01-03 03:11:36 Exactly.  But I can understand if, at the time, there were many instances of stupidity and/or carelessness, which then caused the need for some sort of legislation.  But it is Jersey after all.  Also kind of suprised that they haven't banned changing your own oil in your vehicle.

9339 2018-01-03 03:11:23 Jacob, a word of advice. You really need to change the oil in your hair every 500 miles.
9340 2018-01-03 03:11:23 しろろ病欠とか多分初めて、、、
9341 2018-01-03 03:11:09 I gotta change my oil before I head down to the Gaylord. JOY... :l
9342 2018-01-03 03:11:01 Bitcoin mining currently equals the same power consumption as Denmark. As the Algo gets more difficult, by 2020 it could equal the same consumption as the rest of the world. Guess your padding the pockets of those monopolistic greedy Energy & Oil Giants while killing the planet.
9343 2018-01-03 03:10:58 Lil Oil Change.  Wonder if I could say it's a metaphor so I could act all ironic and such if I were to really have that as #myrappername?

9345 2018-01-03 03:10:41 Oil prices close to mid-2015 highs, but doubts over further rises loom  #Forex
9346 2018-01-03 03:10:28 We heat with wood, but the stove had died down. This was after I’d gotten it stoked again.  We have oil as a backup. That makes it easier to leave for a night! No heat upstairs, tho, except passive.

9349 2018-01-03 03:10:24 Wow... Is this the same Raj Oil Mills from Nagpada? Are they listed on exchanges?
9350 2018-01-03 03:10:16 Putting aside the question of how much electricity crypto currencies use, oil is not really used much to generate electricity in the US except in New England, Alaska, and Hawaii. To first order, the price of oil has nothing to do with electricity use.
9351 2018-01-03 03:10:13 Perfect end to any type of day = hot oil shower. LIFE CHANGER.
9352 2018-01-03 03:10:10 @KpDat the olive oil definitely worked

9362 2018-01-03 03:08:43 Are the oil hikes gradual increases for the new TRAIN Excise tax? If so, this is well and good to avoid shocking the public w/ immediate one time increase
9363 2018-01-03 03:08:33 Yea I remember you telling me! But those are the ones that you put the flavored oils in that explode. The one my bro used to have. Mine is super small and is only for weed oil lol.
9364 2018-01-03 03:08:27 Is there anything more enticing than the aroma of onions & garlic sauteing in olive oil? Yummmmmm

9367 2018-01-03 03:08:21 Hate to say this but he seems to have forgotten that we are in this situation because of the same policies - iran had brief democracy but was taken from it for British oil interests and US Cold War concerns. Almost 70 years later , people of Iran want to be free; but not this.

9379 2018-01-03 03:06:40 I do believe in the potential for ANY mining ops to damage the environment. That said, there are many great companies working to treat the wastewater produced as a by-product of both lithium & oil production to get excess minerals of it & return it to the Earth clean. Chill out.
9380 2018-01-03 03:06:38 Groundnut and mustard if I have to chose from this list. Otherwise coconut oil and sesame oil.
9381 2018-01-03 03:06:37 I don't quite get why it is "imperative for the SW to back PMB in 2019, as a matter of political expediency". I'd think the expedient thing is rather to ditch him. His failure will ultimately be hung on our necks, and like the proverbial oil tanker, he's finding it tough to turn.

9384 2018-01-03 03:06:22 That was awesome!  #minecraft time was great.  I've never used the fancy mods other than railcraft (i cry I miss that one).  I made drying racks today, and a creosoil oil thing (sp?) and I've got this sweet row of things, and on the black table I put a flower it's so funny
9385 2018-01-03 03:06:21 Shit, son. Put some vanilla chai scented oil on your light bulbs.
You are welcome.
9386 2018-01-03 03:06:16 Olive oil is good only for drizzling on salad raw. Not good for heating.

9489 2018-01-03 02:53:12 look. I've tried practice 10 steps korean skin care routine and guess what. It doesn't work on me. I notice that the less is better for my skin. Double cleansing is worse if I use cleansing oil instead of balm. Plus it's hard to tell which product works better and which is not.
9490 2018-01-03 02:53:11 It’s -13 here and I’ve been pumping my own gas since 1995. Please tell me you know how to check your oil and tire pressure? If you can’t do those three things, you shouldn’t be driving.
9491 2018-01-03 02:53:08 Yes, and a very clever joke, I liked it! but some genuinely question my nickname and I thought I would address some concerns;) the whole situation is so silly really, let’s MAGA

9510 2018-01-03 02:50:49 Anyone that believes one word of what that psycho snake oil salesman Alex Jones says needs to have their head examined.  Don't waste your time debating people like that.
9511 2018-01-03 02:50:46 Yep. We might just get a slow death by radiation and nuclear winter, instead of a quick blast. :-(
Or be invaded by a bunch of rich assholes people looking to escape the mess they helped create. Potable water is the new oil, etc.

9519 2018-01-03 02:48:54 That's the most ridiculous tweet I've seen in a while. You say "it is well known" then you say "the Brits want to keep it a secret". Don't you see the dichotomy of those two statements? The potential of the West of Scotland for potentially having large oil reserves is NO SECRET.

9525 2018-01-03 02:47:53 Word salad just now from my trump loving brother in response to me asking for a double blind study to backup his latest snake oil, “double blind creates blindness”.  Great slogan, bad science.
9526 2018-01-03 02:47:36 Today while I was at Pep Boys waiting for an oil change, I met a 92 year old man who had two heart attacks, open heart surgery, and three leg surgeries. And I can assure you, he was probably one of the most happiest person I ever spoke to.
9527 2018-01-03 02:47:21 My car has 2 recalls, so why am I finding  out now after calling to make appt for oil change that I can’t get until Monday?  Appt lady has no idea how serious the recall is...Really?
9528 2018-01-03 02:47:20 Hahaha yess.  Fuck those beats,  go oil
9529 2018-01-03 02:47:18 Once a nutritionist told me to keep switching between between the type of oils. So except for olive oil, we keep switching between all every 3 months
9530 2018-01-03 02:46:54 I'm def becoming one of those people, but if you find yourself unable to concentrate on important tasks try some pure essential oils in an oil burner. I recommend scents with variations of peppermint, geranium, bergamot, or ylang ylang.

- olive oil
- the hygiene and fresh smell after you take a bath
9543 2018-01-03 02:45:51 I manage a smoothie bar..  Our Tropical Turmeric is that, plus mango and coconut oil and cayenne pepper.  Delish!
9544 2018-01-03 02:45:43 Well written Sam, it's appalling what transpired during the colonial era, most of it is still in practice, across Africa, middle-east and South America. Corporations supported by govt still exploit countries, it's resources and citizens. Be it Oil or minerals !

9548 2018-01-03 02:45:22 Coconut oil. Cheap and effective everywhere
9549 2018-01-03 02:45:15 Similar correlation with oil and DJIA over 50years but with a 10yr lag(DJ follows oil). If correlate maintains, would suggest Dow hits 15-17k in 2018 tho. Feel free to back test

9558 2018-01-03 02:44:19 What is an "NDP apologist troll"? Are you sure Conservatives aren't working to protect their interests and incentives within the oil industry? The Conservatives have not apologized for the cost of the #enronclause. Paying for corruption is non partisan. #abpoli #thedeklein

9574 2018-01-03 02:42:08 OH the "oil" like in the vape pens?  They have some here with no smell.  

Or some with flavor too.  I have a mag mile like that. The no smells I have fruity pebbles, sour skittles and a strawberry.

9629 2018-01-03 02:34:03 I don't know what your skin type is but washing your face 4times a day seems a little overkill. too much washing can dry your skin. coconut oil leaves your face reallt shiny and greasy looking and doesn't seep in well idk if that happens to you. but whatever, if it works for you
9630 2018-01-03 02:33:56 Yup! Currently have a runny nose, heavy head and itchy throat . Grinning and bearing it with ginger tea, hot water and whiffs of eucalyptus oil
9631 2018-01-03 02:33:44 I put peppermint oil on my nipples to attract dead people, its how my tuesdays typically go
9632 2018-01-03 02:33:32 I just got my oil tank refilled, do you @realDonaldTrump think I will last through nuclear winter
9633 2018-01-03 02:33:29 Ha-ha! But if you weren’t joking... Indeed I’m an American of Russian heritage and I’m an IT guy :) Please know, I am also a true patriot and conservative in the deepest meaning of those words. Few people pray and do as much as my family for the success of Trump. Because I know.
9634 2018-01-03 02:33:17 Local 342 Concord, Ca Natural Gas/Oil Pipefitter/Welder here...now solar. Sure 6 figures, but you're never home. If you don't mind that, you're good. I sell the sun now and so... I'm home to raise my family and manage a ranch. Choose well, padowan. Our prayers and blessings
9635 2018-01-03 02:33:14 My dad was an oil burner mechanic and would work around the clock in these conditions. These guys are under appreciated sometimes.
9636 2018-01-03 02:33:10 Also it shows that socialists will immigrate into an ancap society. Mexico is a failed socialist state and the immigrants are moving to a more capitalist one. Despite this, they still vote for socialism.

9644 2018-01-03 02:32:18 Just take the warnings against using olive oil seriously. I accidentally grabbed it without thinking  once and had to throw out two cups of mayo.
9645 2018-01-03 02:32:13 No it loves my face my body doesn't like it so much I need a thicker oil like castor oil

9663 2018-01-03 02:30:01 It's sickening. Alaskans are being held hostage to benefit the oil gods.

9668 2018-01-03 02:29:31 We should hire the Chinese to enforce the embargo and pay them more than they make in the oil and other products they are selling to North Korea. Everyone wins.
9669 2018-01-03 02:29:27 Umm...maybe try some warm olive oil to drown them.

9677 2018-01-03 02:28:18 If #Trump wants to start using #US #aid dollars to strong arm weaker nations shouldn’t the world find a different way to pay for #oil. No more #petrodollar may focus #America’s mind!
9678 2018-01-03 02:28:14 My brother I won’t lie, before I answered you I read articles to make sure I didn’t lie and the truth is, lithium and cobalt aren’t rare earth minerals and this whole notion was brought by oil companies to discredit EVs, so I was wrong. But fact remains fuck electric cars
9679 2018-01-03 02:27:38 Do not use immigration as a political pressure valve. Mexico has been able to descend into corruption and crime due to us not securing our border.

9683 2018-01-03 02:27:17 Exactly - 2018 - Way past time to ignore that clown. Folks (ME!) need to stop getting baited into reacting to the soft bellied snake oil salesman’s reckless behavior.

9685 2018-01-03 02:26:55 Albinism Day

I asked myself hypothetical questions 
and i wondered if those lamps would serve as light for others

Then I said if someone comes behind to light those lamps again 
Then this would be the only way 

Those lamps with oil could be a light for others there to see
9686 2018-01-03 02:26:48 They all did, several of us worked at every station.  And that one you are referring to was a stepping stone for a lot of attendants at one time.  Gas Town was the goal.  Better money and it had a roof over the pumps.  We pumped your gas, washed your windows and checked your oil.
9687 2018-01-03 02:26:43 See and I bet avocado clumps just as bad as banana. I'm sticking with mayo, olive oil, & eggs. No clumps.

9690 2018-01-03 02:26:04 So these guys keep coming up in the recommendations for oil deliveries. Very popular and good reviews!
9691 2018-01-03 02:26:01 Plus he helped decimate two national monuments with lands sacred to many Tribes. Sold himself out to oil & gas industry.And morphed into trump sychophant cc @jbouie
9692 2018-01-03 02:25:54 That I did.  That I did.  Thought you changed and I started to worry about you.   LOL.
9693 2018-01-03 02:25:54 Climate Change is the mechanism for redistribution of wealth.  Notice how this supposed crisis can be stopped if the US just gives enough money to the UN so they can take their cut and distribute the money.  Review the Iraq food for oil deal and how much the UN stole.
9694 2018-01-03 02:25:52 why the excitement with oil? we had gold and obuasi looks like a slum! We don't choose brainy leaders like they do in Joburg, Dubai or Bahrain to benefit. Our oil money goes to foreign banks - just like our gold. We are cursed with poor leadership n the oil money is already gone
9695 2018-01-03 02:25:51 People are just now catching on to castor oil 
9696 2018-01-03 02:25:47 @realDonaldTrump is basically identifying all Muslim countries & claiming to withdraw cash. Well Saudi et all do your worse; withdraw your oil, your purchasing power in US & let him suffer.
9697 2018-01-03 02:25:47 Just tried to cook a fried egg without oil for the first time and I'm not sure if it was well cooked.
I'm kinda scared now D:

9704 2018-01-03 02:25:15 The pipeline argument doesn't really gel for me, surely Syria is not the only route from Saudi to Europe, might be the shortest.  Maybe to stop Syria from allowing Iranian oil/gas going across Syria, I can buy that, its acheived .... so far.  War in the end is pointless.
9705 2018-01-03 02:25:00 How about any deaths resulting from his deregulation of the oil industry?
9706 2018-01-03 02:24:53 Yea I definitely use organic. What oil do you use on your face ?
9707 2018-01-03 02:24:52 I put my essential oil diffuser in the living room. My dad calls it a hookah pot. He just yelled “Morgan, your hookah pots empty”.

9709 2018-01-03 02:24:42 DDT.  Powder form could be applied directly to troops and clothing, ended typhoid/typhus and other flea-borne illnesses as a major problem for allied troops in WW2.  Sprayed on islands, along with oil on stagnant water, eradicated malaria in many areas.
9710 2018-01-03 02:24:38 Reduce the heat maybe. Also are you using any kind of oil? Choose one with a high smoke point like vegetable, not a low one like olive.

Also kick on your range hood.
9711 2018-01-03 02:24:34 lol I mean all of our oil wars so far have been pretty shitty
9712 2018-01-03 02:24:31 yeah for sure it's sneaky, the U.S and Saudi will be business partners before and after Trump. They have a monopoly on the oil industry in the entire middle east.
9713 2018-01-03 02:24:30 I need to get an oil change like tomorrow
9714 2018-01-03 02:24:00 I'm also in the "economic headwinds" camp after overconfidence / overheating, but expect that to hit more in 2019. Also, expect it will take a few more years before EVs hit oil prices.

9720 2018-01-03 02:23:23 Ahhh! I use coconut oil to get my make up off with a face towel but rinse it off too. If it’s for your skin, go organic. That’s probably the heaviest thing I use but I think the witch hazel after it def helps it not be so heavy.
9721 2018-01-03 02:23:14 I love when someone is feeling sick and essential oils folks say “peppermint oil helps so good for a fever”. Thanks Dr. Can’tconstructasentance.

@Champs04311 was given some home made pills labeled “for cold and flue”.  I threw them out and for better or worse saved Doug’s life.
9722 2018-01-03 02:23:00 We agree w/ @jfberke that it's past time for big players in finance like @blackrock & @jpmorgan to factor climate risk into decisions.

We also want to know what they plan to do when they get the disclosures, or info like our report on their investments in Amazon oil drilling.
9723 2018-01-03 02:22:56 Olive oil can be massaged into the skin. Over time it makes your skin appear very toned.
9724 2018-01-03 02:22:55 I think KJU has destabilized Asia and needs to come to the negotiating table (ie UN resolutions). US, China etal have cut off NKs trade and oil supply. If KJU launches a nuclear weapon at SK I think US should definitely respond.

9727 2018-01-03 02:22:03 The only solution is improved emission regulation. Not just from autos, but from energy production, oil refining, magnesium and other smelting, and the ridiculous open air military waste burns we allow.

9736 2018-01-03 02:20:49 The #1 ripoff in American history began with GW Bush looking the other way his first year as President...thus leading to 9/11.
The costs involved were:
1- Bush said the war would cost $150 Billion...NOT.
2- Bush did ZERO to maintain a low price of crude oil.

9737 2018-01-03 02:20:35 You're more extra than extra virgin olive oil
9738 2018-01-03 02:20:24 I'm a trauma nurse. I work in an ER. Not just dead bodies stink of decomp. Living people with infections, internal cysts, etc, can too. The peppermint oil helps me concentrate on the patient and not the odor.

9740 2018-01-03 02:20:03 I was lucky in that I worked on an oil rig on rotation, so didn’t effect my work.  Personal life was fine too, as I was single and still seshing a lot (early to mid 20’s). Actually made some good friends from it. Health wise....not good!

9754 2018-01-03 02:19:01 Yes - storage at grid scale seems an obvious place to put more research money. Suspect grid solar is in a rather unproductive race to produce the "cheapest" power & ignore externalities. Ironically ignoring externalities is a 20th C oil & transport speciality..

9756 2018-01-03 02:18:56 I just found a small scale infestation on one of my stag horn ferns. Noooo! We were able to pick most of it off, now I need to find some oil
9757 2018-01-03 02:18:46 Best way to disable the Mullah' s regime is to prevent them to sale oil. Goverment pays religious fanatic people a lots of money to kill demonstrator on the street with knife and sticks.
without the oil revenue they can't function.
9758 2018-01-03 02:18:35 This should be a pretty physical affair...unless the mighty Oil don't show up...please show up boys. I can't take anymore fire McClellan morons...

9760 2018-01-03 02:17:49 No. No I havent. Ive seen steady oil prices. Are you in Calif where they tax hiked the crap out of you to help pay for the safety & security of all those illegals?

9765 2018-01-03 02:17:20 You don’t need to use a lot of the Witch hazel or tea tree oil & you can get those almost ANYWHERE. CVS, Walmart, Walgreens etc but the more natural the better. Both smell kind of strong so don’t use TOO much or you’ll dry out your skin even though your skin naturally has oils..

9768 2018-01-03 02:16:48 hold hands...? mine are still covered in oil... is that ok?

I suggest getting a high dosage of vitamin E oil capsules and putting that oil directly on your stitches.   I had a bad car accident and had 350-450 stitches on my face.    The vitamin E oil really helped.   I have never had any plastic surgery and I look fine

9773 2018-01-03 02:16:13 I see the complete opposite. I see energy prices going sky high because of these failed global policies. The replacement for fossil fuels is more than 2 years away. Peak Oil is a theory pundits, just like the ones behind Climate Change, use but rarely provide facts to.
9774 2018-01-03 02:16:08 Longest wait ever for an oil change
9775 2018-01-03 02:15:52 Hey Iran put Iran first #MIGA right.  I heard this all before.  No blood for oil! Stop trying to fight a war. Iranians don't care what you say. #MYOB .
9776 2018-01-03 02:15:52 Daily goals for a better year:

Meditate/Daven/Contemplate
Drink more tea
Use my beard oil 
Get Jedi hermit style beard
Become one with The Force.
Bring balance to the Galaxy.
Pet my cats.
9777 2018-01-03 02:15:33 Not at all! Get trout! It should be gutted in half! Put rosemary sprigs and lemon and shallots and salt and pepper in between the two halves! Drizzle with oil! Bake at 400 for like 20 minutes!
9778 2018-01-03 02:15:28 I burnt my arm with oil spatter trying to make you scream and then ghost you.
9779 2018-01-03 02:15:16 
9780 2018-01-03 02:15:13 #2018goals Oil my hair, moisturise skin, less caffeine, less nicotine, hydrate myself, much more water. More sun, more music & coconut oil.
9781 2018-01-03 02:15:10 Trump is God, don’t you know! Trump keeps the planes from falling from the sky, he keeps the instant tellers working, he pushes oil through the pipelines by sheer natural talent. Thank God Trump has opened our eyes to how vulnerable we are to a mad child narcissist, biggest ever!
9782 2018-01-03 02:14:44 My car been here since 2. Why is it taking so long to change my oil
9783 2018-01-03 02:14:42 Like the kind of guy that continuously let his tank get down to E, the oil light comes on repeatedly, and keeps needing a jump... After you said something about an oil change, getting the battery checked, and stop letting your tank get below half. To be cont...
9784 2018-01-03 02:14:41 For oily skin I recommend using oats, & a bit of hot water for hydration/exfoliating, witch hazel or tea tree oil too bc they’re good for preventing & reducing acne especially for oily skin.. If you have a blender I’d blend them up but you can always mix it up by hand in a bowl.
9785 2018-01-03 02:14:21 #IranProtests #Iran The National Iranian Oil Company needs to go on strike in support of the Iranian people’s homegrown freedom movement.
9786 2018-01-03 02:14:07 I think all Cancer Councils here in Australia @CancerCouncilSA @CancerCouncilWA @CCNewSouthWales @CancerCouncilOz are scared of safe natural effective plant medicines such as CannabisOil #medicalcannabis Cannabis Oil Kills Cancer Cells and Black Salve removes cancer. Ur a JOKE
9787 2018-01-03 02:14:05 I wash my face when I take a shower at night. And wash it in the sink in the morning. I usually take a shower at night, because it gives me more time to get ready for work in the morning. I only use 3 products. Rose water soap cleanser, rose water toner and coconut oil.
9788 2018-01-03 02:13:56 I'd rather be boiled in oil.
9789 2018-01-03 02:13:44 One of the cooks at my job burned my hand with the oil from the fryer. So then she started rubbing mustard on it and I ain’t gon lie that shit was weird but it helped .

What have you done for your people? Did you bring #oil #money on their table or you gave it to #Syria and #Lebanon and #Yemen? 
This is the result of your (#Islamic #Republic) mistakes.

9795 2018-01-03 02:13:00 And when farmers realise that you can get twice as much money from the one plant and cut cost on water they will turn to hemp growing...sell the buds for oil for food and the rest for clothing and stuff like that well the cotton industry will raise in price

9798 2018-01-03 02:12:51 What you are proposing will require having the technology to make that transition. Its being worked out so dont worry. You wont be alive to see an oil free world. Clean energy to supply the entire US isnt sustainable yet. Ask Bill Gates. He declared bankruptcy trying.
9799 2018-01-03 02:11:35 Boy, they don't get the oil, and what we’ve done. On a personal note, what an America First economic plan looks like. States is run.
9800 2018-01-03 02:11:26 Who needs regs. Lower drinking water standards will be fine. Asthma suffers need to buck up and oil rigs look pretty cool when they blow. We don’t need no regs!!!

9803 2018-01-03 02:11:14 リンボきゃわわ
9804 2018-01-03 02:11:13 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
9805 2018-01-03 02:11:13 Really? My face is oily too and if I put oil on it (coconut) it gives me blackheads. My dermatologist told me to stay away from it.
9806 2018-01-03 02:11:04 What if oil prices decline?  What if higher taxes on East/West coast homeowners result in fewer car sales?  What if global trade numbers are currently overstating actual underlying trade? What if China economic growth slows down further?

9811 2018-01-03 02:10:12 Every time I set an appointment I tell myself the earlier the better. For sure going to regret my 7am oil change 
9812 2018-01-03 02:09:57 What have you done for this people? Did you bring #oil #money on their table or  #Syria and #Lebanon and #Yemen?

9814 2018-01-03 02:09:53 Personally, I think about the vat of hot oil a lot. But I’m also boring and typical, so.
9815 2018-01-03 02:09:53 Need to get me some tea tree oil again. Breakouts getting outta hand 
9816 2018-01-03 02:09:48 Heres another secret Artie. If SA decided to cut off our oil we would die. No transportation, no electricity, no clean water, garbage would pile up, sewer plants would stop. Then what Artie? What is your plan & timeframe to save humanity? I think you need to leave it to experts
9817 2018-01-03 02:09:41 A simple oil change and tune up gone all sorts of bad. Now left with a broken antifreeze hose. It’s fine. I’m fine
9818 2018-01-03 02:09:24 It's never really been about what North Korea can do to us, it's about Seoul. Bragging about who has a bigger nuclear arsenal is not going to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. He should really stick to pressuring China's oil supply in an adult like manner
9819 2018-01-03 02:09:16 Tell your daddy and Tillerson they're not getting a war wIran or it's oil so stop pretending to care about Iranians.

9821 2018-01-03 02:08:45 Read the tea leaves
Kim calls for talks.
Probably b/c China/NK caught smuggling oil. 
Their game is over, Trump knows it.
Kim broke first.  Trump won.
Trump's rubbing his nose in it.
Now he'll make Kim suffer a while before actual talks start. 
Meanwhile lefties clutch pearls
9822 2018-01-03 02:08:38 How about let's stop giving $$$ to countries that don't like us and vote against us at the UN. Now that our ENERGY RESOURCES are skyrocketing, let's tell them they can keep their OIL! In fact, they can DRINK THEIR OIL!
9823 2018-01-03 02:08:31 I have a big pile of cbd hemp. I was gonna just vape it but I think I might infuse it into coconut oil instead to test my theory about the pressure canner
9824 2018-01-03 02:08:08 All about the oil..
9825 2018-01-03 02:07:21 今年はダンディ系のコスプレしますかねー（笑）
9826 2018-01-03 02:07:17 2018 all about coconut oil
9827 2018-01-03 02:07:16 Argan Oil
9828 2018-01-03 02:07:11 But gas prices go up during a cold spell right? I don't know about oil burning plants, but most gas plants have no fuel on site. So while they are getting the same price as all plants the fuel costs have gone up, unlike at least coal plants.
9829 2018-01-03 02:07:08 Got it out the mud no oil spill  shit now oil makes me richer 
9830 2018-01-03 02:06:55 This is big one something serious is wrong in our system and if we keep this going the system may be hard to recover .......in a serious poverty and hunger they are working hard to sell Petrol product high now why are Nigeria oil producing nation PMB pls
9831 2018-01-03 02:06:55 I cant wait to ppl go to sleep so I can anoint their head with some albaster oil
9832 2018-01-03 02:06:52 Ever brush Brussel Sprouts with olive oil and throw them on the grill?
9833 2018-01-03 02:06:48 Because who cares about the health of the public. As long as the oil industry can make more money.

9835 2018-01-03 02:06:36 I coached him. Well.......my novice team got to stand on the Oil Kings bench. During the warm up He brought us a championship. Best of luck to him
9836 2018-01-03 02:06:24 Well the economy is already doing well. Emerging markets have improved along with global trade growth. Oil price increases could create a lot of jobs. Therefore a recession in 2018 would seem unlikely.
9837 2018-01-03 02:06:23 Sounds like a very reasonable approach to weight control. I agree about healthy fats. Plus, healthy fats like olive oil & avocado help you absorb fat-soluble vitamins.
9838 2018-01-03 02:05:53 drivES IN WITH A DAMN OIL TANKER 

WHAT DID U SAY??? ADD??? FUEL?????
9839 2018-01-03 02:05:42 It's like a snake oil salesman, except you don't even get a bottle of stuff to prove you spent money someone else ran away with.
9840 2018-01-03 02:05:29 Face timing Roxy with TeeJay and Flint and TeeJay is talking to my mother about fancy olive oil
9841 2018-01-03 02:05:10 Donnie do you know anything about history at all? The US is responsible for the creation of the Islamic Republic, through its backing of the corrupt Shah, in order to keep US oil companies in Iran.
9842 2018-01-03 02:04:48 Ah I don’t know much about ringworm except I used tea tree oil to make it go away
9843 2018-01-03 02:04:48 Wanted to pamper myself 2nite so I put on a face mask which made my face burn for approx 10 mins. Then tried a new lip scrub. After I applied it  I realized it has macadamia oil in it & I’m allergic so I’m impatiently waiting for my mouth to swell up :-)
9844 2018-01-03 02:04:45 I need to go get an oil change tomorrow
9845 2018-01-03 02:04:41 @david_bellamy write a song about the oil driller
9846 2018-01-03 02:04:23 Well, he sure is filling those "orders" from NOKO for oil!
9847 2018-01-03 02:04:22 I have to ask all the don’t tread on me free market I should keep all I earn jackholes if they built their car or the roads or refined the oil they pumped into gasoline or used a currency they mined/printed.  Seems like everything they can do is because of others work.
9848 2018-01-03 02:04:15 I usually use what i can find on google. So not really. If I need something quick I’ll use brown sugar and olive oil.
9849 2018-01-03 02:03:59 When your friends parents get excited and bond over olive oil
9850 2018-01-03 02:03:40 Red currant jelly is amazing on meat! But Chili oil is great on curry... Hmm which one is the best..?

2) Pure Shea butter 1 oz
3) Pure Coconut oil 1 oz
4) Olive oil 1 oz
5) Mineral oil 1 oz 
6) Tea tree oil 5 drops
7) Rosemary oil 5 drops
9852 2018-01-03 02:03:16 How does everyone know what the difference is? Where is it stated that one is made with oil and the other isn't? What secret society do you all belong to?

9867 2018-01-03 02:01:36 We must stop enabling @realDonaldTrump. We must no longer cover his childish antics, his nonsensical outbursts, his tantrums. The news media must not report on any more oil this garbage. For all of our sakes. it's time for Congress to act as well.
9868 2018-01-03 02:01:33 Cant you offer him a good deal?  Like a piece of the arctic oil, and some communications satellites, and assets of Solyndra?

9873 2018-01-03 01:59:58 I’m behind them so they can’t see me but I have been evil eyeing them. Now she’s still complaining her salmon didn’t have truffle oil or some shit.
9874 2018-01-03 01:59:56 I’m deluded? Dems are in TX, but they don’t get out & vote. The fact is oil/gas move here for tax breaks, but govt attempts to defund public ed thru charters, church, & private schools receiving vouchers. TX becomes more diverse every day turning more blue whether u like or not.

9876 2018-01-03 01:58:49 Disappointed in your comment on Iran.  What's the difference?  Theocracy vs. democracy-Pope does not rule a country. Subjugation of women-genital manipulation-permissive conjugal rape. Nuns choose their vocation.  We don't buy Iran oil -Europe does-deafening silence!

9881 2018-01-03 01:58:14 The worry is losing market share. Not that fossil fuel demand will end tomorrow. Within the next two years we will have reached peak #oil and it will start its decline.
9882 2018-01-03 01:58:10 Trump puts a ban on Muslims but now cheers them on in Iran. It’s all about oil, and that’s it.
9883 2018-01-03 01:58:03 Every day when you decide to pull into a Shell Petrol Station you are putting your hard earned money into Shell Oil's hands.

9889 2018-01-03 01:57:06 Look at all the good Ctax has already done. Investment back. No more “dirty oil” protests. Companies and citizens reducing emissions everywhere and creating jobs doing it. Half revenue is creating jobs on greener projects ..
9890 2018-01-03 01:57:01 If such a tax is NOT on the rich, why are the rich in NY NJ CT and CA complaining they are getting hit so hard? BP oil ius having to poay billions more in taxes. You didn't read the tax plan.
9891 2018-01-03 01:57:00 White or Russet potato thin sliced on mandoline, dried out on paper towel, seasoned with spices of choice and 1tsp of olive oil and baked until the correct consistency. Look up the Tasty recipes for homemade chips and adjust time & temp based on oven specifics.
9892 2018-01-03 01:57:00 I need some oil sheen 
9893 2018-01-03 01:56:55 The sooner you understand that the oil industry is doomed the sooner you can start planning an economy that will thrive in the 21st century.
9894 2018-01-03 01:56:46 Tit for tat.
9895 2018-01-03 01:56:43 I’m surprised my car hasn’t blown up yet with this HG leak, super dumb oil pressure drops when hot , and not knowing wat AFR it’s running at lol 
This weekend I’m pulling the head so issa gonna be fun
9896 2018-01-03 01:56:26 UN is useless. They couldn't stop its own leader from corruption with Oil for Food program. We may very well be doomed.

9898 2018-01-03 01:55:58 Anne, is there a relation between the virus that we saw in My Struggle with the black oil or not? Because that could cause a global domination, right?

9906 2018-01-03 01:55:29 The tax cut? I am receiving is a tax increase of 25% How come a tax bill is taking health care away from millions and opening up much a Alaska to oil drilling for the benefit of international oil companies?
9907 2018-01-03 01:55:11 Cracked oil pan = no oil. No go.

9913 2018-01-03 01:54:36 You said, "I bet you're lonely." Talking about humility and understanding, that is rich coming from you.

9915 2018-01-03 01:54:25 I've needed air in my tires since Christmas Eve. Every time I go to the gas station with the intention of getting it, there's a lineup three cars deep. So...guess we're waiting until the next oil change.
9916 2018-01-03 01:54:14 One has oil, the other doesn’t... Sad that it’s that simple...
9917 2018-01-03 01:54:13 Billions of dollars have been abandoned in Canada's whale oil industry, and what has Trudeau done to support the industry!?

9923 2018-01-03 01:53:09 i agree with you ... and have no doubt US was involved in overthrowing shah... just bc oil prices were going up... and he was too powerful..., but this recent protests i doubt it and dont think has anything to do with US given ppl involved, scale and how it was initiated...
9924 2018-01-03 01:52:44 wrong. you and he have betrayed the citizens you pledged to protect and serve. he opened up two natl monuments to serve oil and gas interests, u and he voted for the tax scam bill, have turned a blind eye to russia's hack of our election and conspiracy w certain elected officials
9925 2018-01-03 01:52:44 @NickWilson923 Oh hey, synthetic oil and a 10k filter. Then you can go 31-1.
9926 2018-01-03 01:52:40 @nicrouleau nic can i make a full oil portrait painting of your doggo?

9928 2018-01-03 01:52:19 L'Oreal's Pure Clay Detox & Brighten Mask is AH-MAY-ZING. You could literally see how much oil and gunk it sucked out of my pores (note: don't look too close at your face if you have trypophobia, you *will* faint). My pores were so clean and super invisible after washing!!!
9929 2018-01-03 01:52:13 started slathering literal oil on my face and it feels great and i haven't had a breakout yet but you can consider this tweet pre-owned
9930 2018-01-03 01:52:07 @TuckerCarlson We enjoy your show but some of these same old truth/facts Dodging idiots you have on really gets our blood boiling.  Need a fresh new set of idiots  #Tucker
9931 2018-01-03 01:52:05 my mama got the heat too high, it melted my coconut oil 
9932 2018-01-03 01:51:47 Keep it up Mr. President, we want the oil prices to increase! 
9933 2018-01-03 01:51:46 Dear Art, just moment of thought,  you once teased some analyst about whether they have been to any oil field.I am surprised,in our time,any man can be qualified as a major investment chief analyst appearing on financial TVs without any relevant  empirical experiences.

9943 2018-01-03 01:51:00 I won’t be alive... this should have happened in the 1800’s. But a few greedy men had to have it all. Oil, electricity, newspapers. Tesla was murdered for what they are now bringing forth. Shameless, disgusting and you will pay.
9944 2018-01-03 01:51:00 I agree lots of options, most are not readily available or as cheap as Oil/ Coal. I interviewed at Consol 15 yrs ago. They can Mine from SW Pa to NC. Their estimate was 350 yrs of Coal in the one seam. I’m sure we will find something better in that time.

9946 2018-01-03 01:50:50 He needs to smuggle oil in from China lol he's not hitting North America with any Nukes
9947 2018-01-03 01:50:50 Lol right? My skin is pretty sensitive so I've been debating about using them. I've only ever used masks. I bought foam cleanser and oil cleanser so if that goes okay, I'll venture into more stuff. I've used cerave cleansers for 80 years lol
9948 2018-01-03 01:50:40 Muslim protectors  Bill   Hill CNN  Huma Vatican  ALL FOR OIL MONEY SHAME SHAME SHAME
9949 2018-01-03 01:50:34 yeah i know she wasn't literally killed off but she basically was? like, turned into oil or something & removed from the show. i wasn't sure how to indicate that in such a tiny space.

9956 2018-01-03 01:50:01 Notice oil fields never managed to change hands at any point?
9957 2018-01-03 01:50:00 You can be sure of Shell!  Honest as the day is Long. Of course in London winter a day is pretty short....  Lets look at some more Honest Shell Oil work and show how Honesty is highly valued in Shell Group from esteemed leaders that are looking after your Oil Dollars!
9958 2018-01-03 01:49:47 1) Sorry, was not able to answer earlier. Plenty of good answers already. A lot of cars are insulated, steam tubes run between the inner liner and outer shell. Length of time to unload depends on the product and how cold it is. Soybean oil about 2 hrs, beef tallow can take 6.
9959 2018-01-03 01:49:47 I baked the salmon put lemon,pepper,garlic powder & olive oil me no like

9968 2018-01-03 01:48:24 I need to go buy more coconut oil
9969 2018-01-03 01:48:20 I drink pureed spinach and fruit every morning with vegetable powder, MCT oil, and turmeric powder to manage my 2 issues. It has helped
9970 2018-01-03 01:48:16 Why does beard oil smell like vomit 
9971 2018-01-03 01:48:15 Check
9972 2018-01-03 01:48:00 Walmart & witch hazel toner tightens and refines pores while gently removing excess oil & dirt. I also got some biotin
9973 2018-01-03 01:47:40 It's called Behavioral Science and it was the thread, not the tweet.  Expand your objective lens and try some humility and understanding. No one person is perfect and always does the right thing or hangs with the right people. #Growth
9974 2018-01-03 01:47:19 اهم شي اقتنعتي
9975 2018-01-03 01:46:53 Woah this is a sick oil pastel painting
9976 2018-01-03 01:46:53 how have I lived my past 22 years of life not using coconut oil!!!!!!!!!
9977 2018-01-03 01:46:26 I JUST ACCIDENTALLY DRSBK COCONUT OIL BECAUSE IT EAS NEXT TO MY WATER DJDKAMANDMF IM GONNA CRY
9978 2018-01-03 01:46:22 Iran should be ‘interesting’. Protests over poor economy. I believe Trump wants to re-impose sanctions. If only the US sanctions then no problem. If UN sanctions oil, Iran will be in more trouble economically, and OPEC/Russia/US will love it as oil price surges
9979 2018-01-03 01:46:12 oil painting my nightmares
9980 2018-01-03 01:46:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, or government benefits.
9981 2018-01-03 01:46:08 おじさんにはおじさんの色気があっていいんやで〜？目指せダンディ！
9982 2018-01-03 01:45:53 If by standing up you mean twitter wars, then sure. But if by standing up you are talking about limiting oil sales to NK from Russia, your orange master follows Putin’s commands...
9983 2018-01-03 01:45:47 Mix 9 oz corn with 1/3 cup banana. Add Olive Oil. Boil. Serve over kale.
9984 2018-01-03 01:45:46 "I know you're the last person i should ask, but do we have olive oil?"-someone who forgets i am a chef and have cooked pancakes
9985 2018-01-03 01:45:39 I been using Wild growth so Ima keep using that Plus Castro oil
9986 2018-01-03 01:45:39 I'm perfectly happy to die in the first wave rather than spend a minute with survivalists hopped up on gun oil and canned beans
9987 2018-01-03 01:45:33 Tried this Josie Marian oil after my glam glow mud mask. Let’s see how I’m looking in the morning.
9988 2018-01-03 01:45:32 So this not another bad Russian behavior thats the result of US policies in Europe in the interest of the US oil & gas industry
Just like the Syria war is linked to oil & "gas" pipelines that are to cross from Qatar & KSA to Europe
9989 2018-01-03 01:45:25 Compare the coverage of the TRAIN’s oil excise tax rates and soda taxes to the coverage of the TRAIN’s lowered income tax rates. 

People can get far more in return than what they will pay back in taxes.
9990 2018-01-03 01:45:19  Today, data is the new …

9991 2018-01-03 01:45:14 Think bigger too. Who ships all that oil for these countries? Most don't have steel mills
9992 2018-01-03 01:45:11 どうしたの？大丈夫？少し休んだほうがいいんじゃない？
9993 2018-01-03 01:45:10 Carly: *spills oil on herself* "THERE'S OIL IN THIS!!!!!!!"
9994 2018-01-03 01:45:10 I need some castor oil 
9995 2018-01-03 01:45:04 First of all those are both terrible for your lips. Use coconut oil and sugar and scrub all the dead skin off then use vaseline ya heard?
9996 2018-01-03 01:45:02 1.6 billion hold most of the worlds Oil, Gold, Diamonds, gas, and much more they have nuclear weapons, yet Islam and Muslims getting slaughtered. We curse the leaders the traitors. Muslim scholars reply khawaarij. But watch the slaughter of Muslims in silence.
9997 2018-01-03 01:45:01 Damn it, where ARE these job advertisements for "medical industry shill"? I keep missing them.
I've been arguing against anti-vaxers and snake oil merchants as a public service, and it would be really nice to finally get the $$$ for it that you people keep claiming we get.
9998 2018-01-03 01:44:44 I always thought it was gonna be "people thought they could eat money, drink oil, and breath gas"...
9999 2018-01-03 01:44:41 on this edition of things i got free for being written off: a swanky concentrate vaporizer, a big bag of infused bath salts, a full bottle of infused olive oil, and two different infused salves.  i am #living #my #best #life
10000 2018-01-03 01:44:11 Remittances are Mexico’s top source of foreign income, outpacing oil exports, which totaled $18.5 billion between January and October, according to the most recent figures available at the Bank of Mexico.
10001 2018-01-03 01:44:10 Coconut oil makes you smell like a sweaty coconut but it feels so right
10002 2018-01-03 01:44:10 I know it’s coming. It’s all BS anyway. Canada is like 1% or 2% of the worlds polluters. Yet our government is acting as if the tax money will solve the climate issue. We knock our own oil production while buying foreign oil & they are far worse offenders than us. It’s silly.
