1 2018-12-04 23:56:15 Are you suggesting a focus solely on bitcoin and fintech will be superior to the ability to invest in real estate, equities, bonds, digital assets or commodities?  Seems like their will be tremendous opportunities looking at assets millennial's ignore.
2 2018-12-04 23:52:33 People with the education that includes psychology and technology will be hot commodities.
3 2018-12-04 23:51:12 Patrick Corbin is not a unique arm. Pitchers like him, better than him, are available on the market or by trade most years. Machado and Harper as young, difference-making superstars are rare commodities on the open market.
4 2018-12-04 23:46:02 (sic) What’s wrong with a carbon fuel tax of $7/gallon-where people can’t even afford to go to work, where deliveries of consumer goods cost more so commodities like toiletries & food prices go through the roof. Damn globalist lies-!
5 2018-12-04 23:45:29 Maybe not different than oil crudes. But different than most commodities that startups need.
If I'm a founder and I need an office, I know for sure I can go get an office, and have a sense how much I'll pay. >>
6 2018-12-04 23:45:28 I don't think your analogy work here since we are not commodities. US has decided that they would like to get immigrants from every corner of the world not just from one country. #HR392 will shut out applicants over 190 countries for several years.
7 2018-12-04 23:42:45 You have a severe underestimate of the talent that is out there.  The only problem is promoters haven't been working on making them known commodities.  The problem is the promoters would rather play "woo woo is me" instead of developing a rotation of talent.

9 2018-12-04 23:40:47 ICYMI: #Commodities trader TrailStone stops trading #oil in London (will retain some oil trading in the US) — #OOTT more on @TheTerminal via @catkngai and @lc_hurst
10 2018-12-04 23:32:59 I knew everyone only wanted what they could get. I knew people were commodities to be traded & bartered. I thought love was a commodity. Something of value. It’s nothing. It’s empty. Just words. All words, no feelings. Other people throw words around & they mean nothing.
11 2018-12-04 23:24:39 Why don’t you try to copy their value added tax to include health care, day care, and education. The three most costly commodities that  working class  Americans are struggling to pay on minimum wage!! Our pay checks have not kept up with the cost of living.
12 2018-12-04 23:24:15 As a person, a broker and principal registered in 69' securities and commodities with Dow at 967 and change; it should be a given that at a level of 26,000 that moves of 600-800 could be common.While not likely in my lifetime, these moves could be an every day occurrence.

14 2018-12-04 22:58:59 And co-ops traditionally set up to trade commodities and lack capital or incentive to move beyond. Some obviously do succeed beyond commodity market.
15 2018-12-04 22:58:18 sir Adam e' lei che non ha idea mi creda, nelle banche d'investimento le divisioni in genere sono: Private Banking, Asset Management, Capital Markets ( equity, fixed income, currencies, commodities) Proprietary trading, Corporate & Investment Banking. Non copritevi di ridicolo.
16 2018-12-04 22:53:10 Exactly. I could be wrong. But that what I’m waiting for. Go see it either bounce and confirmation up, or to go right through the lows. Until then I’ll stick to commodities.
17 2018-12-04 22:53:07 If they can't ship it out why AB do not invest in new refineries? That will create a refined and more expensive product, not to mention that refineries will create long term jobs, not like pipelines. Time for refine the oil in Canada and stop giving away our commodities for low $
