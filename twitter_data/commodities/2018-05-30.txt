44 2018-05-30 22:10:56 We the oppressed citizens humbly pray that good counsel prevail upon our law makers, Executives of the nation to liberate us from the price rise on Petrol because it creates ripple effects on all the essential commodities
45 2018-05-30 22:08:44 Which is exactly what I said. "assessed value" . A terrible indicator of wealth.

All you are doing here is supporting a system that treats homes as commodities. Which is the very mentality that brought us to this sad state of affairs.
46 2018-05-30 21:47:32 I've been a sex worker for 15 years. No one has 'bought me' yet. I provide a service & retain 100% of my body afterwards. If you feel all workers are 'commodities' then we can talk about capitalism. Otherwise you're side stepping my original question yet again.
47 2018-05-30 21:47:28 5. You may work hard and save a lot of money for decades and then have your money become worthless like it did in Weimar Republic because of Congress. It would be nice if national tv asks members of Congress when they will back money with gold, silver, other valuable commodities,
48 2018-05-30 21:45:42 As if any president controls international commodities markets, as both the president & Schumer are well aware. Well, at least Schumer is. Looking like the D's 2018 plan is to ignore the rancid orange & focus on the "economic anxiety" crowd?

50 2018-05-30 21:23:50 In any case the idea here is for the poor people to remain poor so that they can be manipulated with ease, the prices of basic commodities is going up every time and still many companies will produce false figures so  that they can qualify for exemptions , watch the space!
51 2018-05-30 21:20:39 My company trades commodities and hedges risk - we operate in a complex and unstable environment leading to high uncertainty -  we are mostly organic w/ decentralized decision making - a tweet from our president can change everything and potential gains into losses! #mavorg

54 2018-05-30 21:07:38 Generally low interest rates allow smaller monthly payment for higher priced homes driving prices up

Land scarcity relative population pushes price up as well as people bid for location

Bigger issue is #resources depletion raising commodities prices supporting growth
55 2018-05-30 21:07:16 Another side note, I've decided that bonds and notes futures do not fit into my "commodities" trading plan. Too much correlation to the overall market.
56 2018-05-30 21:03:15 The cost of labor is determined like all other commodities are, supply and demand. Yes if I am being paid $15/hr but only produce 10/hr my employer is losing 5/hr for each hour they employ me. I must be able to produce more than $15/hr. If I dont I will be fired.

60 2018-05-30 20:58:44 I’d separate the legal definition of securities (which describe barious asset classes like bonds, stocks, etc) from the asset itself. Commodities vary quite a bit - real estate vs gold vs corn, etc.
61 2018-05-30 20:15:34 Yesterday was a rug pull or bear trap for US equities. They are going much higher once this period of consolidation ends which is soon. Equities are the safe place to be. Commodities/ags will accelerate higher as we get inflation (and see agriculture shortages in a few years).

72 2018-05-30 18:51:34 Mr Hegde, the problem is not petrol prices per se. Cos of high fuel prices, the prices of all essential commodities have gone up. Bus fares, the common man's transport, have more than doubled. Edible oil is Rs90/ltr. Good Aatta is Rs35/Kg.

119 2018-05-30 16:22:28 High price of essential commodities and high population growth can't go together. One of the two has to decrease.
120 2018-05-30 16:20:33 To know more about commodities ask MCX , NSE , BSE or NCDEX and their expert advisories for more beneficial tips.
121 2018-05-30 16:16:47 Personally I think the last few months and coming bull market is a perfect storm of all 3.  

Relentless rising global demand + supply shock fears + global asset allocation to commodities.  

Money flow + demand put a "floor" on grain prices.  Supply shocks are inevitable.

128 2018-05-30 15:52:26 Price controls are harmful because a forced increase to a commodities price lowers demand.This lowers profits and production.A forced decrease to a commodities price reduces production levels.This lowers profits and demands for commodities are not met...

147 2018-05-30 14:48:43 Petrol & diesel prices drop by ₹0:01

Obviously this would mean trucks will charge less for transportation.

Therefore prices of commodities will drop.

Therefore drop in inflation.

186 2018-05-30 12:26:13 it turns out we do a terrible job of valuing time and money correctly — in part because we don’t understand the kind of commodities they really are... An abundance of money is considered a status symbol, while an abundance of time is considered shameful.

243 2018-05-30 06:57:00 DTI Asec Ernesto Perez:  Our analysis is the effect of fuel excise tax… is only very minimal because transpo cost only constitute 5% of the prices of basic necessities and commodities (via @maracepeda) #OnlyInThePhilippines
244 2018-05-30 06:47:15 We manage because we know the truth unlike dumbs.Inflation is at 4-6% which means price of essential commodities at check.If somebody complains about that too, then we can remind them of 2013.

245 2018-05-30 06:45:16 @AntonKreil where do you see commodities in the next 5 years especially agriculture and precious metals ?
246 2018-05-30 06:40:37 Disagree on this one . It is very true commodities are normally a horrible investment but ill side with Buffett. When asked why he the biggest purchase of silver (Commodity) he reminded them 3000 year low, call it anything you like. time will tell If It appreciates. Trillions
247 2018-05-30 06:39:26 @dpradhanbjp  what a mockery on reduction 1 paisa. If it was same much criticism and anger of public would have avoided. Govt can reduce at least 3 to 4 rupees by adjusting with some other luxury commodities.@narendramodi @PiyushGoyal @BJP4India .
248 2018-05-30 06:35:58 India is always high PE.Indian market PE shud never be compared with that of a Russia,Brazil or other emerging stock markets.Russian indices are mainly concentrated on energy stocks where as Brazil is in commodities.India has consumers, auto that traditionally commands high PE.
249 2018-05-30 06:22:12 End your addiction to drugs by refusing to be a puppet, a social plant, a weed suckling on commodities that destroy your consciousness.
250 2018-05-30 06:21:19 Buying women for sex is not being philanthropic it is abuse of gendered power, and patriarchal in making women’s bodies out to be commodities that can be bought and sold. #buyingsexisnotphilantropic
251 2018-05-30 06:10:30 When it was the GNU, positive change was felt within a week.They didn’t announce receiving any money like the "New Dispensation" gvt but things were happening. What happened to "hitting the ground running?" Fuel price hikes next it's basic commodities! Things are getting harder.
252 2018-05-30 06:08:13 #Soybeans  Intrathe downside prevails.
Pivot: 1035.00
Therefore: short positions below 1035.00 with targets at 1014.25 & 1007.75 in extension.
Otherwise: above 1035.00 look for further upside with 1044.00 & 1050.50 as targets.

255 2018-05-30 05:57:07 People will be selling their equities and securities and commodities such as gold and silver will go up because people will be looking for alternative stores of value for the money they get from selling their equities and securities and bitcoin etfs will provide an alternative
256 2018-05-30 05:48:56 The value of M&A transactions rose to US$25b during 1Q18 (up by 86%) on the back of the merger, PotashCorp and Agrium. However, activity elsewhere in other commodities was generally slow and the volume of transactions decreased by 16% year-on-year to 101 deals in 1Q18.
257 2018-05-30 05:40:41 What I think is going to happen in 2018 or shortly thereafter:

Interest rates will go up 

deutsche bank will go under

European economic crisis 

Equities and securities will go down across the world

Commodities will go up 

Crypto, as a better store of value, will Boom

281 2018-05-30 04:44:11 That's true, the government keeps all the money for themselves, we Mexicans never see any of that, you see, deputies make over 15000k per month compared to the average 500k a normal citizen makes. They have tons of commodities such as free gas, free internet, etc.
282 2018-05-30 04:43:20 Ah, all right. I trade in equity and commodities in the Indian financial markets.  Is your trading technical? Cause I believe that cryptocurrencies are still in the nascent phases to have strong fundamentals.

290 2018-05-30 04:10:54 9. In plain English, Indonesia needs to spend more money to buy Indian goods more than usual so that India can scrap trade barriers for Indonesia commodities.
291 2018-05-30 04:04:17 Sir, do think daily hike in diesel prices will transform the farmers and will automatically sell agro products 1.5 times higher,as well as every common man is fighting against this Mahgai not only in petroleum but in related commodities.
292 2018-05-30 03:58:44 Healthcare premiums going up because Trump was going to do repeal and replace.  No replacement was implemented.

Gas prices going up because of commodities speculators.  Same happened under Obama and speculators were stopped.  Not a supply and demand issue.
293 2018-05-30 03:52:44 Please stop the increment in price of petrol and deisel in india. .

304 2018-05-30 02:50:15 I’m okay with market commodities for trivial things, provided they’re well regulated (and worker controlled!) but all the bottom of the Maslow pyramid stuff needs to be a given

306 2018-05-30 02:46:34 Where water is privatized people are disposable commodities. It's what the slow-motion, corporate coup d'état is all about.
307 2018-05-30 02:30:36 Siguro, kung hindi maitataas ang minimum wage, gumawa ng paraan ang government natin to curtail inflation. And para bumaba ang cost of basic commodities, fuel, pamasahe, etc. Kaso iba ang priorities nila e.
308 2018-05-30 02:26:22 I agree, but compared to other commodities oil and gas go hand in hand much more than others.

318 2018-05-30 01:36:13 I read it correctly, which is why I provided you the farm receipt data.  It is impossible to defend 94% of farm program support going to just 6 commodities that only account for 28% of farm receipts.  The CRS report discusses this disparity in detail.  Thanks for the discussion.

323 2018-05-30 00:58:18 A lot of "outside market" noise contributed to the weakness in Ag commodities today.

324 2018-05-30 00:54:00 Farmed animals, for over 10,000 years, have been specifically bred as commodities. They're not pets. To uncommoditize anything is to understand the nature of ownership and the inhumane acts towards human and natural resources. We're all slaves.

330 2018-05-30 00:38:19 Which is somehow true naman since OPEC ang nagdidikta ng presyo ng krudo which in turn influences other prices of commodities.
331 2018-05-30 00:36:35 My dear this demand was valid when inflation was in double digit. Now only petrol is at UPA level and all essential commodities are much cheaper than 2013-14 level.
332 2018-05-30 00:35:19 We've got to stop using this type of language with education. Customers purchase commodities. Education should not be seen as a purchasable commodity. It's a public good, something provided by a government for the benefit of all.
333 2018-05-30 00:29:52 For years in USA,  strong export of High technology items like Arms,  planes,  are used to subsidise imports of low Tech items like toys, auto parts,  steel and commodities.  This has deform the trade.
