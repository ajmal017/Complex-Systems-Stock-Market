When you want to buy in some stocks which isn't $, you need to sell your $ to get that currency you need .

Call your broker and he'll explain how to do it 
3 2018-07-01 23:56:57 Taking this statement at face value (which btw is erroneous), how does that differ from investing in stocks? Aside from that, it's absurd to think that any one thing is the be all and end all ...
4 2018-07-01 23:54:45 Should be enough to rally stocks to another ATH.
5 2018-07-01 23:54:06 The global markets in general had a bad reaction to China / US trade war. Many stocks unrelated were slammed.
6 2018-07-01 23:51:35 If you want to start charging for list of stocks to trade you really should meet with a lawyer to get a solid disclaimer written - and also discuss the potential legal pitfalls.
7 2018-07-01 23:50:28 If believe in Arithmetic of Active Mgmt, underperforming active funds implies outperformance elsewhere (e.g. households) + When look at stocks driving S&P (e.g. AMZN, NFLX, AAPL, FB, MSFT) and likelihood of individual owning them, where is evidence individual not outperforming?

38 2018-07-01 23:39:50 My guess is he and his corrupt buddies want to make lots of money: drive down stocks, buy low, lift tariffs and stocks rise. Then sell. I think people are missing all the corrupt connections with foreign countries.
39 2018-07-01 23:39:09 If not sold the stocks then sel it now and enter sometime by end of Aug. Keep watch on JSW/TataSteel/SBI/UltraTech/Infy/Sun Pharma/Spice jet/Indigo/Asian Paints. Accumulate it at dips to build a solid porfolio and if recovery happens in 19 then expect 25% return
40 2018-07-01 23:37:12 What do you mean gun controll. Are you talking about how i would go to prison unless i turned over bump stocks and shit? Gun controll affects law abiding citizens, not criminals. All you are “controlling” is what someone who follows and obeys the law can have. Fuck off with that

49 2018-07-01 23:26:29 I always respect people and opinions. What I don't get is shorts who have lost money for years in this case. I looked at some of the cash flows and balance sheets of a lot of hyped stocks and yes they are terrible. But they just keep going up.

57 2018-07-01 23:20:09 Sure and I want stocks in an uptrend also. Still got to assign some probability though. How much of a discount would you require to take opposite. If I offered you 10k in a random 52week high stock 4 a year, how much would I need to offer you to take a 52 week low stock instead?

81 2018-07-01 23:03:24 #gpp could well be accurate  assumptions. One thing is for sure, if Haveron next results follow on in the same vain the life changer is on. This will undoubtably start motoring this week in anticipation.

85 2018-07-01 23:01:24 Should we "means test" unfunded tax cuts to corporations w/pre-existing condition of record profits in name of jobs instead used to buy back stocks no help to 1/2 us w/no investments? GOP denying healthcare to taxpayers w/ pre-existing conditions to pay down deficit they created?

90 2018-07-01 22:49:30 Trump has every property incorporated as an individual business. So a single business can go bankrupt while he himself and the other businesses are solvent. Nor did he lose other assets like stocks and bonds or the rest of his father's assets he inherited later on.
91 2018-07-01 22:47:46 I will there is a Firearms group that has already file a brief to block it. The guy's on the MAC channel said the NRA is backing it because of the bump stocks but it has morphed into all devicies
92 2018-07-01 22:47:33 Unfunded tax cuts to corporations w/pre-existing record profits who bought back own stocks not helping 1/2 country w/no investments at all. Now to pay for 2 trillion fed debt rung up GOP wants to deny healthcare to taxpayers w/pre-existing health conditions. Mid-term messaging!
93 2018-07-01 22:45:34 I'd throw a second-round pick at Chicago for Kahleah Copper and see if they bite. There's talent there but Stocks doesn't seem to know what she wants to do with her. #wnba

110 2018-07-01 22:28:29 ETFs or mutual funds. Stocks if you want a little more risk; however, stay away from futures, crypto currency, variable life insurance, variable annuities, and shorting the market.
111 2018-07-01 22:24:17 So this could mean a crash/fall of assets and stocks?
112 2018-07-01 22:23:20 It's a pump and dump scam! That is why the SEC put them here in oct 2016.   The SEC warns shareholders about stocks on the OTC.  Last 6 Mgti insider transactions. Have all been Sells.   And another at 1.00 last week.  And more insiders to sell!!!! Do NOT buy!
113 2018-07-01 22:23:05 And... ?  As for coming out on top, with less than 2 yrs. in office jobs R up, unemployment down, GDP over what was ever predicted, Stocks doing fine. Consumer satisfaction pretty high. I'd say Trump is ahead right now.
114 2018-07-01 22:21:27 Am interested that nobody is suggesting during these interviews that the most obvious way to claw back lopsided distribution of income, whether from wages, stocks n shares or govt heating grants, is via a revised, fair tax system. Next budget?
115 2018-07-01 22:21:17 buttoned codpiece, his nether stocks bemired with clauber of ten key points that the Premier and I. Clean tables, flowers. 4/4
116 2018-07-01 22:20:16 There aren’t enough significant events that have occurred to prohibit bump stocks other than this ONE incident. That is ridiculous to use as a platform to prohibit others, bc one crazy person went off the rails.

121 2018-07-01 22:16:50 If you were smart and knew Trump would win. You would have bought stocks of companies that aligned with his energy policies. Say like CAT. I bought it as 66 and its over 130 now.
122 2018-07-01 22:15:46 Deficit and debt keep skyrocketing. Companies like @harleydavidson are bringing their companies overseas. Companies are buying back stocks to the tune of $189 BILLION while there are no wage increases. There are more tech jobs but our work force is not trained. Huh?? #tonedeaf
123 2018-07-01 22:14:51 Um, we’ve already had a correction, genius, defined as a. 10% decline in stock prices. I hope for your sake you don’t stay 100% in stocks in blind allegiance to your Great Leader when the real beat mkt hits!
124 2018-07-01 22:14:49 They are paid to sell a spin. In 2007 talking heads sold you a "trading nirvana" and general stocks euphory. They did their job well.
125 2018-07-01 22:13:13 The goal is destabilization of Western economies. @realDonaldTrump , his family & cadre of Cabinet members will benefit—as will Putin & his inner circle of oligarchs—by shorting affected stocks & commodies, among others.
It’s time to face the fact that Trump is a committed asset.

127 2018-07-01 22:12:37 If the assumption is that a new form of non-sovereign (crypto-) money will prevail, then, of course, it is a foregone conclusion more people will hold money than hold stocks in the future scenario with new money. Why no distinction made b/w new crypto-money and commodities/etc?
128 2018-07-01 22:12:23 It is while stocks last lovely so depends

131 2018-07-01 22:11:05 There remain at least 40 of the original leaders trading within 10% of their 52-wk hi. So there can be substantial opportunity should the avgs make a stand here around their 50-day lines. But bases need time to be formed #stocks
132 2018-07-01 22:10:51 Exactly. At end of the day its still hockey, not stocks. People who have never been apart of a team will get importance of culture/chemistry

134 2018-07-01 22:08:55 I'm talking about people with money.  

Who do you think is buying all the bonds at 2%-3% return?  The rich keep a large portion in preservation mode, not stocks.  Stocks are amazing, but volatile. The rich don't need to take that risk with all their money.
135 2018-07-01 22:07:03 Unbelievable that Trump has fulfilled all his promises he's made to us and his first yr isn't even up. What exactly is he doing that he's destroying our country, what destruction? Stocks up, jobs up, business coming back. Am I missing something? Jackass @billmaher

137 2018-07-01 22:04:24 Well it's a scare tactic by Black ops agents in an attempt to pyschologically inhance the fear of E.Ts... mutalations of live stocks have been showen that military does it.. Electromagnetic pathetic machines also induce a sense of hallucinagic euphorias of abductions...
138 2018-07-01 22:04:21 Growth stock players will need to be patient while the initial group of leaders repairs their charts to form new bases. This will likely take weeks, not days #stocks

155 2018-07-01 21:38:03 @TransMetalsCorp Hello, there right now with progression have your company pegged at 15 cents a share price traditionally 16 forward earnings $2.40 currently, but due to the nature of mining stocks and 25 projects on the go should be 20 times
156 2018-07-01 21:34:03 Trend is the most important thing. No point looking at stocks in a downtrend unless for shorting.
157 2018-07-01 21:33:06 The country is doing better because of eight years of Obama’s presidency. He pulled us back from a recession. In less than a year, we have tariffs, losing jobs, stock market is tumbling, companies are buying back stocks and made a mockery of our immigration.
158 2018-07-01 21:32:30 Looked at the SeekingAlpha website for the first time in a couple of years or so. Almost all bearish, another good sign for the back half of 2018. Midterm election chatter should prove good for stocks yet again.
159 2018-07-01 21:32:22 And companies bought back the most stocks in history - greatly dwarfing amounts given to employees. 

Previous record?  Right before the great recession of 2008/2009. 

Brace yourselves for the crash in 2019.

163 2018-07-01 21:29:17 i used to think the entire time, but now i only think between stocks or matches or slow parts of matches(hitting someone far offstage but they live).  i feel much calmer and adapt much better when i play now

Passing laws that are targeted at those who do not obey laws, only harms the law abiding.
174 2018-07-01 21:20:30 Unicorns are another $800B.

So Crypto + Unicorns = almost as much as the stocks quoted last Cycle. 

The point is that this Cycle many of the most large and frothy valuations aren’t simply in public markets. Doesn’t make them less frothy.
175 2018-07-01 21:20:09 So are stocks
176 2018-07-01 21:19:58 Haha. Yes the oil has been there for years. The reason why it hasn't been produced is, that most of it is non commercial. Plus this guy only pumps and dumps stocks that's why he's being so rampy!

192 2018-07-01 21:06:36 I agree but like I said shit happens whether it’s stocks or cryptos or just plain old life.. they’re still here n are trying to fix the mistake they made. Yea it prolly takes awhile to respond to u I’m sure they’re pretty busy. If they actually stopped talking then u could start
193 2018-07-01 21:06:09 "Damn, sorry to hear that, Stocks. I'd say that ups my chances at what comes after 'skate fast,' but at this point, it's not too big of a deal. What made things fizzle out?"
194 2018-07-01 21:04:48 The US economy has been artificially inflated due to the recent tax cuts, causing companies to buy back their own stocks. This increases their value, without them actually being worth more.

The low unemployment does not take into account what types of jobs, people have.

195 2018-07-01 21:03:58 I'll merely note that yes the 'stocks' had a bad quarter', but The companies themselves are literally rolling in money. Bullish $BAC and $JPM, the two financial leaders for the world.  @petenajarian
196 2018-07-01 21:03:37 Don't go unless you're sure what you want to do. In the meantime invest in stocks and mutual funds.
197 2018-07-01 21:03:09 Ultimately I think Smash 4 should have been 3 stocks best of 3, would also have nerfed counterpick meta and it rewards quicktime adaptation, we as a com are bitching way too much about changes

202 2018-07-01 20:58:21 Futures should be banned for that reason alone.  I drives up prices while making rich richer.  You should only be allowed to buy and sell at current prices and at that time not in the future. Companies with humongous profits shouldn’t be allowed to have stocks. Use their profits
203 2018-07-01 20:56:52 I do not short stocks and wouldn't put my money in a stock that moves because a company spent billions and a year to do what other companies do on a regular basis!

207 2018-07-01 20:54:54 It actually might not be as good of a deal if he got the money up front and properly invested in a diverse portfolio of stocks and bonds. Hindsight is 20/20, because no one could have known the market success/failure this far down the road. His deal is safer, guaranteed payments!
208 2018-07-01 20:52:16 Conversely, will the buyer get a refund if the picture later on drops in value to, say, £5k? I wonder what Wall Street and NYSE would look like if stocks were traded according to the same principles.

247 2018-07-01 20:06:40 I’m sure some rich people are benefiting greatly from the economy. Not the average Joe or union member. The tax cut is raising the debt. Wages are flat. Stocks are down. The trade war is going to raise prices and relocate jobs overseas.
248 2018-07-01 20:06:09 This is the hummus Brown stocks and I love it
249 2018-07-01 20:06:04 Pretty hype how last night I took 2 stocks off of PhD last night. Plus the fact that I had others congratulate me for it. Melee is sick
250 2018-07-01 20:04:58 I think that's obvious. To buy stocks, there are much higher barriers than in cryptoassets.
251 2018-07-01 20:01:37 The mere fact that you asked what stocks/funding has 2 do w/biz says a lot. Listen.  1. Start a business  2. Ask for funding  3. Work your arse off for years    - 4. Go through a lot of trials  - 5. Hope to turn a profit in 5 years. What part of biz startup do you NOT understand?
252 2018-07-01 19:59:16 The risk reward/ratio on shorting blue sky stocks isn't great.  If they do go to the moon - you could have a 10X loss.

254 2018-07-01 19:58:16 But it is a piece about bubbles in “Tech stocks”. My point is that not all “Tech stocks” are public this Cycle. In fact, Crypto is probably the closest analogue to the Dot Com bubble and none of that is included (not to mention the entire Unicorn market).

264 2018-07-01 19:51:34 The stock market had a massive boost because the pound dropped 15% after the brexit vote making UK stocks look cheap for foreign investors. Our GDP growth is now only just positive.

284 2018-07-01 19:32:26 ECONOMIC DISASTER;  If trump remains in power, economy will tank.  Other countries are already boycotting USA products, If they dump USA bonds and stocks, it's all over.  We have to do whatever we can to get him out now, including getting corp America to stop supporting trump.

293 2018-07-01 19:24:51 TERM OF THE DAY - 
Penny Stock

A penny stock typically trades outside of the major market exchanges at a relatively low price and has a small market capitalization. These stocks are generally considered highly speculative and high risk because of their lack of liquidity,

302 2018-07-01 19:14:05 Owning stocks was not obvious during the railroad era but became the funding engine of development for past century. Governance and valuation of stocks took time to formalize. Crypto is no different but has the potential to allow new models of ownership, community and governance.

304 2018-07-01 19:12:26 Other stocks im in are $TRCH and $ROX. Looking at $PLUG longer term as well. Starting the new trading style off with a bang.
305 2018-07-01 19:12:12 Fair point. I’m mostly referring to stocks like AMZN, Booking Holdings, Alphabet - trading at well over $1K and a fairly long runway to go! Agree Indexes and ETFs that include these companies are prob the way to go for those that don’t mind choosing funds over individual.
306 2018-07-01 19:12:10 I give him a 80-85% chance of winning again. The Democrats have no message but raising taxes and screaming russia while snubbing their progressive base and Sanders.

308 2018-07-01 19:11:25 Lady... You're correct. My annuity dropped $45,000. The value of my home is still down $150,000. For some reason people don't talk about their losses. Other folk's stocks, and investments had to take a big hit?

310 2018-07-01 19:07:29 That's not a correct interpretation. Most stock holders don't have a brokerage account, they have a 401k with stocks or something similar.

“Shall we get pizza tonight?” He asked, not lifting his head from what he was going.

323 2018-07-01 19:00:16 When (not if) things turn, it’s highly likely that the vast majority of stocks will take a beating, unlike the last several bear markets
324 2018-07-01 18:59:40 Maybe- just throwing out ideas.
All of them better way to get through 2008 impact than billions (trillions?) of quantitive easing to keep over inflated bank stocks high.
Investment in infrastructure always good
325 2018-07-01 18:59:38 What’s stopping someone from issuing a token backed by some fraction of a held stock? Similar to Tether but instead of one token = one usd, one token = 0.001 AAPL for instance, with the actual stocks held in a verified account.
326 2018-07-01 18:57:14 Real shit. The bet on us to fail. Trump got elected and prison stocks went up 100%... we gotta move smarter and exceed their expections and overcome the limits they try to set upon us. The scariest thing to them is an educated and successful black man.
327 2018-07-01 18:57:09 Very impressive.  I assume without the use of leverage?  Would be interested to hear about your process for finding stocks.  Also the portfolio turnover.  I think you have posted them but it would be interesting to hear about the companies you currently like.
328 2018-07-01 18:56:55 Agreed just looking at individual stocks
329 2018-07-01 18:54:44 Respected? You aren’t paying attention! Worst stock market last six months. Do you understand NAFTA? Jobs are being lost due to tariffs/trade wars. Tax bill = corps buying back stocks, not hiring and raising wages. You need to do some reading and less watching Faux News!
330 2018-07-01 18:54:43 Let's see if you're right and it's true, I'm bought in 0.22 and I saw those divergences that you comment and the shortening of shorts that coincides in percentage with the rise of October 2017 ...  $HMNY
331 2018-07-01 18:54:39 basically, pid props (large bids that get removed in an instant, creating a vacuum - and the price plummets) this is done on purpose - or a BiG ASK to "show" that price is not getting above that and try to induce you to sell.. small cap stocks are VERY MANIPULATED

342 2018-07-01 18:48:02 does this 500M include shareholders who own stock positions via 401k and other pension funds? I also agree with the whole thread, but a lot of people you wouldn't consider "investors" or "speculators" do in fact own stocks indirectly.

Not saying this is true, but many are saying that Trump’s blind trust run by his family has a large holding in the GEO Group. Possible? We’ll never know.

377 2018-07-01 18:17:19 Bump stocks may have been used in one shooting (and you can mimic it with a belt)

414 2018-07-01 17:44:08 Without a doubt the reason a "red-flag law" has not been passed by Congress is because "gun sales" are much more important than saving human lives. If we could find out what stocks are in their 401Ks, bet u would find gun mfgs.

417 2018-07-01 17:40:58 An AAPL "margin of safety" analysis would require a long analysis. I try not to do that because it encourages people to trade stocks based on stock tips.

430 2018-07-01 17:33:03 Margin calls caused the crash. A bank would make loans for individuals to invest in stocks. Once the bank called the note back the stock had to be sold to cover the loan. The central banks coordinated this after they quietly exited the markets and made margin calls in mass.

456 2018-07-01 17:13:28 Mister finance guy - ur one on a portion. Many many more have gained in stocks since Trump took office. Obama is a socialist. Had no desire for USA to grow.

Trump owns oil and gas stocks, that's why he was so damn set on pipeline, to make PROFITS! Sadly supporters don't care that He's self profiting as President

488 2018-07-01 16:52:14 Japan was manipulating their currency back then, printing yen to buy US dollars imported by their merchants.  Now private buyers of US dollars for yen have taken up the slack, sinking those US dollars into US assets (bonds and stocks).  China followed the same path.

537 2018-07-01 16:17:04 i feel if a regular battle royale game had lives it would make the battle take way too long, maybe if it had less players or faster pacing having stocks would balance it.
538 2018-07-01 16:16:45 Good luck for the future, you’ll be missed at the Flyers.

541 2018-07-01 16:14:31 Great performance YTD Rhom in a very choppy market. I think I hold 7 of the the stocks in your Top 10, but you have achieved a far superior result with your more focussed approach. Best wishes for an equally impressive 2nd half!

543 2018-07-01 16:12:47 One thing you can say I think is that all the dodgy Chinese stocks listed on London were on AIM.  If your company is flawed you will list on the market with the least rules.  Regulation on AIM is flawed with brokers (NOMADS) acting as regulators.
544 2018-07-01 16:12:42 Assault style. If you need 600 rounds per minute to hunt you’re a pretty bad hunter. Gun shows are unregulated with no background checks. Tell that to the 58 dead in Vegas. Bump stocks serve no purpose.
545 2018-07-01 16:11:50 Make sure you add 'No more horse whipping' people in the town square and 'use of stocks'.
546 2018-07-01 16:11:16 Thank you for the last 3 years. Hope you have nothing but success in your next chapter and adventure. Good luck!
547 2018-07-01 16:08:51 a woman trying to do due dilligence on a stock because her husband is investing/gambling away our retirement is now a dumb fuq troll.

keep parroting and delegating away your common sense to someone else, keep betting on stocks that drop from 89 to 29..
548 2018-07-01 16:06:54 Define assault style. Why would you end gun show sales? Bump stocks have been abused once in history. How do you enforce person to person sales. No fly list unreliable.

594 2018-07-01 15:51:03 I totally agree.  Look at 2008, gold went down with stocks.  And BTC has been moving with stocks/gold most of this year.  Everything getting crushed by the dollar strength.  After the next crash, as soon as the Fed hints at QE will be the time to max long everything.

603 2018-07-01 15:49:34 I can't take any more tweets expecting crypto to moon if there is a stock crash.

Seriously- if stocks crater, you think investors (retail OR institutional) are going to dive into an even more volatile asset class?

If stocks burst, crypto will take a hit too.

652 2018-07-01 15:25:20 To change policies & politicians in America you must attack the finances of the filthy rich policymakers! To me marching does nothing!

660 2018-07-01 15:14:28 I personally suggest to invest in Hotel industries will bullish for coming years

 bullish on hotel stocks going ahead. Top pick is Indian hotels ....will be 5x from here in 3-4 years
661 2018-07-01 15:13:25 Yea and as it's going you can adjust the targetsso you can adjust which gets funded at any certain day.. And you can buy/sell individual stocks or whole pies, and rebalance sub pies, whole pies, or the whole thing at any point!
So you can always update and move things around
662 2018-07-01 15:12:59 Dow points are based on stock price not market cap - stocks with high prices have high impact. Cannot take GOOGL, AMZN for those reasons.
663 2018-07-01 15:12:27 Interesting week ahead. The sex appeal of uber sexy HDFC Bank overdone for now & the deprecated mojo of SBI may find a new emancipation. Forget sector rotations, this market is rotating stocks too so choosily & pickily.

If you choose none, name the alternative in the same sector.

673 2018-07-01 15:02:46 Not my convo but you were in the search results. The reason why there are a lot of Cooky now is basically because the huge demand, from dec to march it was always out of stock which made LINE lose clients. The more demand, the more stocks LINE order to the fabric, basic business.

683 2018-07-01 14:57:33 I think P/BV less than 1 may not be possible currently in growth stocks...instead look at Peg ratio
684 2018-07-01 14:57:00 2 of 2. Corporate gains up. But back in shares/stocks Dividends - They did not invest back to the people. Health care higher premiums and cost continue to go higher. Petscriptions all time higher.  Where is your saving from tax Bill that didn't go to other exspenses! SCAM.

692 2018-07-01 14:50:50 Are any of you into stocks?
693 2018-07-01 14:50:17 I’ve had pretty good luck dropping 140k in 15” rows with the air drill on wheat and soybean stubble.  Seeding into corn stocks I like to bump it up a bit.

695 2018-07-01 14:47:15 Who know stuff about “stocks” I think I wanna buy some an get into it but I don’t know nothing help me out.
696 2018-07-01 14:46:45 @realDonaldTrump promised to enact them a long time ago, but it went the way of his promises to ban bump stocks, raise the age limit to purchase firearms, improve mental health care, etc. etc. etc. #LiarInChief
697 2018-07-01 14:44:55 @FaceTheNation I hope Mitch McConnell stops breathing soon we don't need him in our government he is destroying America along with Trump and Ryan. Get rid of these horrible trolls destroying our country making us laughing stocks of the world

699 2018-07-01 14:41:26 I think its also a way of manipulating the stock market. Sell when stocks are high. Announce trade war. Stocks tumble. Prices down. Buy stocks at lower price. Pocket the difference while keeping the same stocks. SEC should look at this.
700 2018-07-01 14:38:36 Can we talk about more neutral things like the weather or how the stocks are doing today
701 2018-07-01 14:37:47 I collect .12 from Bar Mitzvah stocks today, as I will each July 1 through 2019.

708 2018-07-01 14:34:54 Please provide the statistics on wages going up. Aside from the normal 2.3% I’ve received every year. In those stats could you include how many companies have bought back stocks and then finish with CEO increases.
709 2018-07-01 14:33:48 Sadly this was just introduced Wednesday not passed ..... yet. It deals with photo ID. Yes we need to see your face on a photo ID
710 2018-07-01 14:33:27 A person into business approaches his business in a different way than investing in stocks. In stocks he wants to double in a year and assumes his buying point to be the lowest price of the particular stock. That's Y retail guys always fall prey during corrections.

712 2018-07-01 14:32:57 In emerging markets since 1989, the market premium has been the LEAST persistent...

% of 10-year periods since 1989 in EM where:

Stocks > bonds = 83%
Value > Growth = 86%
Small > Large = 86%
713 2018-07-01 14:30:54 Which dems have called for abolishment of our constitution? I personally wouldn't support anyone who does that, either.  To this day the only conversation I've ever seem discussed was raising the legal age to 21 for rifles and banning bump stocks. Which I have no problem with.
714 2018-07-01 14:30:45 Can play to a high standard my arse Stocks is better then you

719 2018-07-01 14:29:37 Good point re stocks. In terms of bubbles, what *does* look crazy high vs the past tho is global debt, ppl shoot this down like whatevs, but IMO it could be an ongoing weight on economic growth, like a slow-motion Black Swan..
720 2018-07-01 14:28:19 Relevant yes but the data they collect are just always taken for granted coz why drug stocks out in some gov't facilities,poor access road to our products for marketing etc
721 2018-07-01 14:27:58 I did that a really long time ago as well.  I forget the stock but it was one Jim mentioned on his show.  2 important lessons came from this trade.

LESSON 1: Stocks can go significantly lower than you or anyone else anticipates. Have a max spot to cut losses.
722 2018-07-01 14:27:33 If one needs tip to buy stock, needs justification from others for his conviction, needs justification for his ideas, he/she should not buy stocks. They should just remember #MutualFundSahiHai
723 2018-07-01 14:27:25 I find this offensive
724 2018-07-01 14:27:07 Many investors accept stocks beat bonds but are skeptical of small/value over large/growth, but...

731 2018-07-01 14:19:00 From CNBC:

"Investors are yanking money out of global stocks at levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis"

What they don't tell you: $12.4 billion today is not the same thing as $12.4 billion 10 years ago. Inflation-adjusted, that's like $10 billion in 2008 numbers.

753 2018-07-01 13:57:43 I do because cnn predicted how everything would fall apart under trump when the stocks reopened, and what happened was it all got better.
754 2018-07-01 13:56:43 Stock data people take bets. They use data to help improve the odds of their bet — much like having the ability to count cards in a deck. They use data to help form an opinion.  In politics, just like in stocks, there is always an opposing opinion based on experience, facts, etc
755 2018-07-01 13:54:26 How to easily find value of quality stocks? If TV analysts are talking about it, there is no value. If they stop talking value will start to emerge. It is in peak of value before people talking about it.
756 2018-07-01 13:53:37 Folks invested in startup STOCKS because of the future profit potential. Since they are seasoned investors, they KNEW the business MUST be built FIRST.

763 2018-07-01 13:43:56 Price to sales is prob a good acid test. Especially with the larger cap companies. But even if we’re lower now, still doesn’t mean some stocks aren’t very overvalued.

811 2018-07-01 12:59:49 And now another smart investor #ekanshmittal makes a case for buying stocks. Says the fall has taken a lot of froth away and one is more likely to make money than lose
812 2018-07-01 12:59:39 I want one!
813 2018-07-01 12:56:09 There are people who insist that the 1929 crash was engineered for these same reasons.  Joe Kennedy got richer in 1929 by buying up stocks on the cheap.
814 2018-07-01 12:56:07 Relax man. Eyes are getting drawn to both stocks which is good for everyone. I have mention MSPC is a good company. Just need to fix the SS.
815 2018-07-01 12:55:49 Is he mentoring or learning from Musk on how to pump stocks?
816 2018-07-01 12:55:11 Taxes: It has given me more money and liberty. It’s also boosted stocks a ton. I agree about the deficit, but I think this may scare Democrats into caring so maybe we can actually get some entitlement reform. So I partially agree. I like the corporate tax reform over personal.
817 2018-07-01 12:54:49 dingo buys out stocks of jeans and shorts bc he keeps ripping them with his giant wang and thighs :/
818 2018-07-01 12:54:46 What scares me is that the stocks for for-profit prisons shot through the roof with the election of tRump. The right wants to jail anyone that doesn't drink the koolaid or bow down and worship tRump. I know he is will do a loyalty pledge to any nominee.
819 2018-07-01 12:54:15 @Delta pretty cool to make us wait on the idiot that stocks the food for the plane.  The pilot told us he can see them at the plane right next to us so.....coming up on an hour soon so everyone is pumped!
820 2018-07-01 12:53:25 I never saw a University College Staff who was not in between 08.30 and 08.50 that is how you can tell they are University Staff they are not on the roads during the Crash doing their Stocks and Shares on Mobile buying a New Portbury Dock which should be Service Centre Left down

826 2018-07-01 12:49:23 Futile efforts with Aramco still on the way, diminishing stocks & production capabilities, heightening geopolitical risks, etc. Buy on dips all day long. Would be really surprised if we don’t print $100 at some point within a year.
827 2018-07-01 12:47:56 Great way to start the day
828 2018-07-01 12:47:33 RS came weeks before the RM preparing the stocks SS. Only a 75K float, 105k OS. The last reverse merger play I was in ran from .14 to $2.56 in just a months time. This one I see going past $20pps in days

832 2018-07-01 12:41:58 For-profit prisons incentivize incarceration.  Political "leaders" eager to jail have stocks in private prison industry.
U.S. has more people in prison than any country in the world. More than China, North Korea, Iran...
833 2018-07-01 12:41:56 Förstår inte att du håller på å jagar dessa dyra am aktier hela tiden. Du vill köpa dyrt, så dyrt som möjligt helst. + risken för att $ går ned kraftigt är stor.

839 2018-07-01 12:38:29 omo this is the problem with purchasing an army bomb, there's literally no stocks and when they do restock it's once in a blue moon and then they are gone after 0.29388382 seconds

844 2018-07-01 12:32:57 Ok. He hasn't done shit for jobs. The tax cut thing isn't a job creator,  those companies reinvested in their own stocks. The job growth is from Obama. What he did to bring us out of the recession Bush made is still working. Trump just tells you he created jobs
845 2018-07-01 12:32:40 I think the argument, in fairness, is that XRP wouldn't be eaily tradeable due to tax/legality issues. Same as stocks/shares, which cannot ever be used as bridge currencies, since they're confined to regulated walled gardens with appropriate documentaiton/checks on every trade.
846 2018-07-01 12:31:10 “Rusty” owns a billion dollar in stocks as he is a successful businessman.

850 2018-07-01 12:28:13 So all those hard working people are lazy and they suck because they are not trading stocks?? Someone need to save life's in hospitals, someone has to bake the bread you eat, someone has to prepare the morning coffee that you drink at Starbucks and most of them enjoy what they do
851 2018-07-01 12:27:18 The article doesn’t say where the investments are going. My guess would be into US stocks.
852 2018-07-01 12:25:39 Agree. There’ll be a blurring of the two classes that will also increase access to and fungibility of stocks, but as a rough guidance: 

Global # of shareholders is currently ~500 M. I’d bet that number roughly doubles by 2024 AND is still surpassed by cryptoasset holders.
853 2018-07-01 12:24:26 You can divide 1lkh in these 20 stocks !!

855 2018-07-01 12:21:24 Do Indian stocks  have quality ? Relatively speaking 

What about ESG Index ? 

Should we not classify promoters in some kind of scale and their commitments to share holders ?

859 2018-07-01 12:16:36 Hi Jessica, the nearest store to you which stocks the Vivera range is the Pontypridd Extra. At the moment it is generally only our Extra stores which stock this range and I know this is a bit out of the way from where you are. 1/3

865 2018-07-01 12:08:53 Which investment opportunities are available to me at the moment for the sum of 100k... The Nigerian stocks market is too volatile for me abeg
866 2018-07-01 12:07:22 How many of those did Bush, O and Holder allow to be lost in Mexico?  Flat desert earth stocks are a dead giveaway these probably started as F&F guns.
867 2018-07-01 12:05:59 You know what is getting old the far more deaths caused from alcohol perhaps we should ban booze! It kills thousands more people than assault rifles, bump stocks etc.. those evil terrorist alcohol companies and terrorist users!
868 2018-07-01 12:04:49 OnePlus has the best online and offline service. Just helping you gain knowledge. And talking about stocks, how does that bother you? If you're getting the product on ordering what is your problem?
869 2018-07-01 12:03:16 I think you're right. It isn't going anywhere. But that doesn't mean 95% of these pot stocks aren't going to fail as companies in the interim. And to my initial Point that's what scares me

872 2018-07-01 12:02:12 Cos it is hot I would go to the shops and see what stocks are romaine-ing on the shelves. Then report back your little gem of information on Twitter.
873 2018-07-01 12:01:57 Tesco Express on Queensferry Road has them in case SGG clears out the other stocks.
874 2018-07-01 12:01:15 i found an affordable sets of metal straws on IG !!!! aaahhhhh but in still wating for the stocks
875 2018-07-01 12:01:12 Those I support. I’ve never bought a gun without having to wait for the background to be done & I was an FBI agent when I bought one of them. Bump stocks are for someone with a certain disability, which should have a verification process. Otherwise, no bumpstock. Simple
876 2018-07-01 11:59:38 I have tried to stay away from posting charts on twitter as feel each persons time frame and goals are different and some follow blindly expecting 100% win rate. For DIA stocks though I have been short INTC and GS lately. The last couple day bounce looks like short opportunity.
877 2018-07-01 11:57:57 @PaytmMoney
I'm curious about this platform...
Can you please clarify whether this platform is just for mutual funds alone or we can trade normal stocks as well?
878 2018-07-01 11:56:38 Bet you ain’t talking shit about them short selling stocks now

882 2018-07-01 11:49:20 If anything this demonstrates the fact that the nifty is a poor representation of the market as a whole. Nifty 50 usually adds stocks that are in favour and removes ones which are out of favour, good investors should be doing the exact opposite!
883 2018-07-01 11:47:48 All commodities are undervalued. Commodities are at 1990 levels and stocks/equities are at all time highs. Which has more room to grow 
884 2018-07-01 11:47:10 I have spread to work to everyone I’m working with this weekend so, admittedly, stocks are running low 
885 2018-07-01 11:47:00 Sen. Cory Booker:“Passing a law that says when companies buy back stocks to enrich shareholders and CEOs they should also pay out a commensurate sum to all of their employees shouldn’t be radical. “

888 2018-07-01 11:44:17 Chap I know who was military intelligence inspected the WP's stocks after the end of the CW and he said the quantity was vast but also felt that the quality gap was far less than was commonly imagined at the time.

892 2018-07-01 11:41:28 "Decentralised" doesn't matter if he has skin in the game litecoin is bigger than @SatoshiLite. If you need to buy a coin because you follow a person you missed the whole point of being here. Go buy stocks then
893 2018-07-01 11:40:42 I read this as "stocks in his pocket" i had so many questions
894 2018-07-01 11:38:29 Crypto is a lot more volatile than stocks. I’m not sure if it would be fair to make that comparison. This model was trained to predict the next hour of prices at 5 minute intervals.
895 2018-07-01 11:36:22 so i've got a bunch of scars on my body and my cousin (male.) told me that i should find a faster solution to get rid of it or not "jatuh saham" which means that my stocks will go down (the 'assets' i can give to men) : ) i want to fucking kill him.
896 2018-07-01 11:35:35 Which specific idea would you like to start with?  Banning assault style weapons! Nation wide banning of bump stocks? Ending gun show Sales? Ending person to person Sales? No fly no buy?
897 2018-07-01 11:34:14 The French want a French winner. To do this less than a week before the start is made them justvto be laughing stocks.
898 2018-07-01 11:33:21 Just a thought, what if the average working person had more disposable income to buy goods and services from companies owned by wealthy people. That seems better than giving tax breaks to wealthy people so they can buy more stocks.
899 2018-07-01 11:31:51 I’m not sure how much of that was deliberate policy with an end in mind as much as an unwillingness to fund it. The munitions stocks situation in the 70s at least caused a scandal within those that knew of it. That belies this being a deliberate coherent policy.

901 2018-07-01 11:28:10 w/millenials (& younger gen) sin stocks are out & ESG is in. advisors happy to comply after having peddling sin for years.

also, crypto investing will make more inroads first w/younger gen. so when will industry dive in?

non-fiduciaries like Coinbase are happy to fill the void.
902 2018-07-01 11:27:33 There is a general lack of education about stocks here. Average people really don’t understand what a good or bad stock is. Brokers just want the fees. I suppose it’s similar in the West.

913 2018-07-01 11:03:20 Aphria & Canopy are solid companies. Sadly, Terra Tech was just another scam. If UR looking to invest, talk to an expert or 2.  I’m no expert on stocks. I was expressing my concern & anger re: more folks being ripped off.  (I’m more of a people expert. Lol) 
914 2018-07-01 11:02:28 After the recent pullback in solar #stocks , I think SolarEdge & FirstSolar represent good opportunities. The #solarpower industry will continue to outgrow most others and there is going to be huge #investment made in the industry over the next 3 years #investing

919 2018-07-01 10:59:02 This is the stuff that SEC is supposed to regulate against - price support based on no financial value.  SEC is supposed to keep stocks from becoming Bitcoin.

930 2018-07-01 10:42:46 So you’re a gold guy, then. How do you not see how bitcoin shares the same properties as gold from a monetary aspect????? Volatility is a function of market size, hence penny stocks. Bitcoin’s volatility *will* decrease as the market gets larger and more liquid

939 2018-07-01 10:26:26 Yes there are some mal practices being done but doesnt means everyone and everything is fake. I will accept it when you stop investing in stocks on the basis of CA Audited Financials. Let stock market be a betting game only depending on luck

942 2018-07-01 10:21:43 Kishore Ji, the key is finding the stocks the NPS is investing in..then from that pack if you purchase the ones with fair valuations .. you can hit the sweet spot..-happy investing
943 2018-07-01 10:18:42 The sharp decline rate is in my view the reason for the underperformance of shale companies. Despite the sharp spike of oil over the latest few days, oil stocks barely move and hover around all time lows.

956 2018-07-01 09:47:30 I was +76% and now +32% . And doing only with stocks , I never invest in options. I hope this is just a big pullback to end the year +100%

962 2018-07-01 09:37:20 We already have universal background checks, and bump stocks are a gimmick that make guns much less accurate and thus much less effective. Finally, you're blaming inanimate objects for the actions of humans, a truly delusional position to hold.

977 2018-07-01 09:01:25 Well. What we did see on bondmarket on friday.... before closing time HUGE  sel off. always takes stocks down also. So us goverment starts to buy bonds back up to prop up stocks. It has been so long time. UNLESS @LandM_Marius  have something we dont know? 
978 2018-07-01 09:01:02 “Let’s put him in the stocks” as in - let’s not buy tickets to his shows? Because that’s what’s happened here. Thousands no longer wish to fund his harmful platform, and somehow we are criticised for that because those who agree with him can’t accept he’s done this to himself.
979 2018-07-01 08:58:24 Some derivatives can be used if one concludes a stock or group of stocks will fall. Selling the stock(s) short (without owning it), buying put options, selling call options etc. Super important to understand in advance how each of them work and the high risks involved
980 2018-07-01 08:58:24 Secondly, it’s the same for most companies. And you can get new stocks ie for instance new summer stocks now for as low as 15k, 20k, 30k. It depends on what you are buying. This is what they do in their stores

983 2018-07-01 08:54:44 Not at all there is a difference he offered his opinion.   The response is lets put him in the stocks mentality.  Educated reasoned debate no longer exists if your opinion challenges the consensus of the left you are hounded.  And I have always classed myself as been on the left

985 2018-07-01 08:52:35 Just a thought, in secular stocks if entry is late,au be after 2-3 years of it's high , example is infosys which was trading at 300 PE at that time some one took entry , he required to wait for ages to get some wealth and investor might loose patience. Risk in secular you see ?

1006 2018-07-01 08:20:32 I might be wrong, but I see a lot of strong #stocks after the short correction last week. The indices are moving sideways, but #Nasdaq is near all-time high. S&P 500 building could move higher here.
1007 2018-07-01 08:20:30 Financials, housing stocks, commodities and more all at lows. Rates are incredibly low for a robust economy. Tax and spending plans not delivering the grow promises. Sentiment data rolling over. What do you see that is robust?

1023 2018-07-01 07:43:08 In some stocks sir, the consistent ROCE is above 50%, but they trades at a P/B of above 5-6 times and P/E of 34 time current year earnings. Do you prefer to look at those stocks for a long time horizon. Ofcourse they also do have a market share of more than 50% in the industry.

1025 2018-07-01 07:41:55 That's the irony -- and not many seem to notice what is going on is a mob mentality, groupthink, polarization, swift 'justice' by social media.

1047 2018-07-01 07:09:50 Regarding black money, clearly it is there still. Why not design policies to channelise it into main stream economy by minimising penalty through real estate, mutual fund and stocks. ... laundering money to foreign banks is no joy. Interest is nil or minimal. Prudence is good.

NEW YORK — U.S. stocks finished mostly higher Friday, but they surrendered most of an early gain as worries about rising tariffs once again dampened investors' enthusiasm as the second quarter came to an end.

1051 2018-07-01 07:04:32 We had CVS, Walgreens, and WalMart take over our neighborhood pharmacies and put them out of business which is bad enough. Now Bezos buys an online pharmacy and CVS stocks go tumbling down... he wants to own the means of distribution for every necessity. That is beyond scary.

1071 2018-07-01 06:21:47 It is wrong to say that what is going down is Junk!! In an irrational market High  quality midcap and small caps are also falling.The bounce back of high quality stocks,irrespective of CAPS, is sharp and furious.

1074 2018-07-01 06:19:39 You were sold out by the "tax cuts" given to the  1%'ers. Trump doesn't want wages to go up (he literally JUST said that!). The owners of your company took their tax cuts and instead of giving back to you, which they should have, bought stocks back. They lined their own pockets.
1075 2018-07-01 06:18:33 he says it isn't the right one bc it keeps changing prices and the stocks go up and down blah blah
1076 2018-07-01 06:16:53 Auto stocks would also remain in focus this week amid monthly sales data announcement.
1077 2018-07-01 06:12:38 My point being...In the beginning one has to focus on wealth creation as well (agreed that is riskier) and then plan for steady dividends to safeguard later years. Assumption here is capital gain through dividend yielding stocks is lesser than others riskier stocks/asset classes.
1078 2018-07-01 06:05:43 It will be certainly rocking as like past Rapid Fire Stocks!!!

1088 2018-07-01 05:43:01 You need to explain the difference between capital markets and banking.  Capital markets creates securities like stocks or bonds.  Banking involves lending.   Justin Kennedy was on the capital markets side, not the banking side.  So no he didn’t approve DBs loans to Trump.

1090 2018-07-01 05:40:30 That said, easier to do would be for KSA to send US more oil and China could buy more from Iran, that would beef up US stocks and bring down price .. if that is the intent
1091 2018-07-01 05:39:42 Yes, my stocks are plummeting. It will recover.
1092 2018-07-01 05:27:58 For investment portfolio I'm not good at selecting/holding quality stocks. Bought RIL at ~950 before stock split and sold ~1000. Overall 3 year old MF and equity PF giving CAGR of 3-4%. Lots of craps in PF:wil try to get out at appropriate time.

1094 2018-07-01 05:25:32 Oh hey Steve. We have background checks and gun safety training classes , the NRA provides some of those, as far as  bashing press look to them cuttti g off heads and shooting people on baseball fields. Bump stocks I agree with. Night.
1095 2018-07-01 05:24:45 No doubt the outlook worsened in the last few months because of Fed tightening and trade war. Important is to be ready to deal with 50% correction in the stock market, have enough cash, no debt. and some put on most vulnerable stocks, at least for me no need to sell everything,

1100 2018-07-01 05:11:32 With that in mind, playing Miis (created/unlocked through the "Customs" menu) when it's set to customs off, is by principle, the same as choosing any number of stocks despite the stock count still being at 3. 2/2

1103 2018-07-01 05:08:51 EPFR: Global Investors Pull $29 Billion Out of Stocks: “Pulling billions out of equities Is the new thing. As can be seen by the latest EPFR data showing global equities had $29 billion of outflows last week, or the most in 20 weeks. U.S. stocks saw $23.6 billion of outflows.
1104 2018-07-01 05:08:33 Here's the key difference:

to play 2 stocks even though 3 is the default, you have to change it manually. Whereas customs are off by default, yet the Miis are playable. This is important to note as Miis can only be unlocked through the "Custom" menu in the first place 1/2
1105 2018-07-01 05:05:06 Did you, by any chance, write a post on Nifty 50 performance (from the 70s) and how the most expensive stocks performed vs least expensive?

That led innovators to think up new modifications like bump stocks, to cater to people who want to rapid fire for recreation but cannot afford an actual ($20,000+)...

My stocks and retirement funds are beating expections. Thank you Mr. President. Under Obama i was paying $2000 just for myself
1116 2018-07-01 04:37:27 The whole reason that bump stocks exist is because of the Hughes Amendment, attached at the last min to a pro gun bill to try to bring it down.  The amendment banned the civilian ownership of machine guns manufactured after May 19, 1986.  There was no debate on the amendment...
1117 2018-07-01 04:37:05 Hilltards son in law dumped a ton of Greek stocks prior to the fall of the economy there..where's the m sm? @EricTrump @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr
1118 2018-07-01 04:35:13 I have buddies who trade stocks and ETFs.
They usually trade when the US market opens because of the volatility.
1119 2018-07-01 04:33:17 Also, IC's are extremely detrimental to local scenes as players who don't know the matchup and are still learning basic game mechanics don't want to get wobbled all 4 stocks in losers round 2 of their 12 person local and it could make them not want to come anymore :^)
1120 2018-07-01 04:33:07 In order to end bump firing completely, the government would literally have to ban rubber bands, belt loops, and yes...fingers.  The only thing this ban will do is hurt the law-abiding citizens who own the 500,000 plus (ATF stats) stocks.
1121 2018-07-01 04:31:54 You don't need a bump stock to achieve the same effect. You can do the same thing by hooking your thumb through a belt loop. It's not accurate, but neither is the bump stock. BTW, bump stocks were invented so people with certain disabilities could shoot.
1122 2018-07-01 04:28:06 Background checks- are required when purchasing a firearm
Bump stocks- I can use my belt buckle as a bump stock so better band belts

1127 2018-07-01 04:24:45 There are over 500,000 of the stocks in existence according to the ATF.  Do you really think we should be banning an accessory from law-abiding citizens that can simply be substituted for by a common rubber band or a belt?  The ban is absolutely pointless unless it includes those

1155 2018-07-01 03:42:17 Great question. My guess is the new sin stocks are very exciting to investors now, who will bid them to unsustainable values, they will correct and then be part of the old sin stock group.

1183 2018-07-01 02:53:26 Global stocks saw an outflow not US stocks. According to the article US stocks saw a net inflow of  6.3 Bn. That means investors are moving there money to the US unless I’m missing something.

1195 2018-07-01 02:38:41 The business cycle hasn't been repealed-Tariffs are inflationary-inflation causes interest rates to rise-higher bond yields depress stocks-Trade Wars are not easy to win!
1196 2018-07-01 02:38:27 Our forefathers also did an excellent job eradicating such menaces as viable Atlantic cod stocks, Carolina parakeets, and passenger pigeons. Let's not hold up misinformed wildlife management (or a complete lack of management) from our past as goals for the future.
1197 2018-07-01 02:36:01 To be fair, I don’t think Trump understands the principle behind allowing flag burning because he hasn’t thought about it and is blinded by patriotism lmao. And the bump stocks seemed like more of a concession/token after Parkland.

1199 2018-07-01 02:31:43 So much winning!  In all seriousness he may have been shorting stocks and coming out ahead. We’ll never know because, unlike all other recent presidents, he won’t show his taxes.
1200 2018-07-01 02:28:55 There you go again lying to the public.....you know that stock buybacks  help the value of the stocks and with millions of working Americans participating in 401k retirement savings programs, they're getting the boost, too.
But you have to work and be legal.

@DNC
@GOP
1201 2018-07-01 02:27:20 The small tax cut that some have received will be irrelevant considering the price of gas has increased, healthcare will increase,manufacturing closing due to tariffs,consumer products increase,consumer spending decreases,stocks go down causing economic crisis globally & domestic
1202 2018-07-01 02:26:31 “Chinese stocks have entered a bear market, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index falling more than 20 per cent from its January high, while the yuan has slumped more than 3 per cent in the past two weeks”
1203 2018-07-01 02:25:33 Cabinet position for Betsy DeVos. Did you know Erik Prince is her brother? I bet tRump didn't know!!!! Just a wild coincidence. Very little reporting on this fact in what the empty headed Orange Idiot calls the fake news. They have corporate advertisers, too, buying back stocks.
1204 2018-07-01 02:23:05 You can't have a rational fact based discussion with a progressive, liberal, socialist, communist.  All they do is personal attacks.  Just laugh at them.  Ridicule them.  It's the only thing that gets through.  Show them up for the laughing stocks they are!
1205 2018-07-01 02:22:26 @MABkc stocks up on henny like Y2K doubled back
1206 2018-07-01 02:22:08 And the Pure Stocks on the track...beautiful sight!
1207 2018-07-01 02:19:17 The two most underrated subjects when it comes to investing in stocks.

1) Asset Allocation
2) Diversification
1208 2018-07-01 02:19:07 Been an interesting few weeks in the markets, noticed that the stocks in my favourite range (0.2 - 2) have been setting up and moving while some of the mid cap names are struggling to break out and stick. $NXT, $SHV, $QAN to name a few mids struggling. 1/2
1209 2018-07-01 02:17:58 For Traders: Avoid this to avoid loss. 

You take a buy trade late into the rally, ( often at the top), then when it falls 10% you buy more to average. Typical stock moves down 30-40% from top when markets correct, so now your are at  -20% loss with more stocks in your hands.
1210 2018-07-01 02:15:45 I became CEO at the beginning of the hit on old economy stocks. When something like that occurs in your first six months as a CEO of a more traditional branded firm, it makes for a fast learning curve.
1211 2018-07-01 02:13:00 As Trump’s “zero tolerance” policies cause thousands of asylum seekers to be detained, the stocks of GEO Group & CoreCivic continue to go up.

Nobody should be profiting off the incarceration of immigrants or any other human being.

Let's make private prisons a thing of the past.

1213 2018-07-01 02:08:00 Why would any responsible,decent govt would sell obscene amounts of arms to backward, sharia wielding, barbarous, uncivilized savages like #Saudi and #UAE with utter disregard to #HumanRights? Butchery is fine as long as the stocks soar. #WarCRimes.
1214 2018-07-01 02:06:55 Bump stocks are already being banned, not that it's even fucking necessary given that there's only ever been ONE incident using them! 

Also, do you even know WTF universal background checks are? I'm guessing you don't! 

BTW, we already HAVE background checks.
1215 2018-07-01 02:04:32 I would ask to the @SEC_News to check who has taken short positions on oil or oil stocks lately
1216 2018-07-01 02:04:28 Isn't that rotten american greed, "I got some great stocks for you" we are supplying needed housing for immigrants. ..YOU Intetested??

BLECK
1217 2018-07-01 01:58:29 You’re delusional the swamp created the need,America filled the need with @realDonaldTrump
1218 2018-07-01 01:56:10 We already have very strict background checks if your 18+ go and try to get a gun and you will see how hard they are to get. As for bump stocks the ban on them is stupid it was used in one shooting and he failed badly by using on he could have killed more if he did not have one

1221 2018-07-01 01:52:08 i was annoyed at the red stocks/muzzles but then it was pointed out that it is likely the sec team's code for "actually lethal" guns. like orange stock beanbag shotguns, but for all the (previously) make believe guns floating around in the park
1222 2018-07-01 01:49:49 This world is full of demons stocks and bonds and bible traders.
1223 2018-07-01 01:49:32 Ugh, stinky stocks.
1224 2018-07-01 01:44:27 Spent the day reading:  I am worried about the trade rhetoric going too far. Signs are there: capital is starting to wdraw from stocks. The mkts are signaling a lot more risk the flash 2q GDP report which may be a one time moonshot followed by the Big unwind. Change tactics now.
1225 2018-07-01 01:43:57 After a little track work, the pro stocks will be coming out to the track shortly.

1228 2018-07-01 01:36:51 Yeah, trading you're going to get feedback on the trade pretty quickly, investing I guess you're just waiting for the next quarterly, earnings or announcement. With investing I guess you have to know what the next stocks will be, looking 12 months down the track.
1229 2018-07-01 01:34:19 Would agree, our stocks in the 9 and 10 department looking woefully low
1230 2018-07-01 01:33:52 Private Prison Stocks SOARING Since Trump Took Office ..... #RealityCheck
1231 2018-07-01 01:30:38 His bump stocks saved lives, they cause the gun to overheat and jam. More shots could have been shot without it.
1232 2018-07-01 01:29:59 Ummm Vegas. Now, name a second mass shooting with bump stocks
1233 2018-07-01 01:26:22 Stock buy backs strengthen company's which employ um employees. Dividends pay stockholders who OWN part of said Co. Generally speaking stocks are held in things like IRA's & 401ks owned by umm employees.  Nice try NBC/Mark. WOKE!!!!!
1234 2018-07-01 01:25:23 Fake News, As a stock holder Harley announced they were opening factories in Asia & Europe to support sales Two Years ago.... Trump wasn’t in office, but ppl were upset at them. They are deflecting responsibility like a true Socialist. Sold all stocks.
1235 2018-07-01 01:24:11 Stock buy backs strengthen company's which employ um employees. Dividends pay stockholders who OWN part of said Co. Generally speaking stocks are held in things like IRA's & 401ks owned by umm employees.  Nice try NBC/Mark. WOKE!!!!!

1238 2018-07-01 01:21:43 Because of the stocks
1239 2018-07-01 01:20:41 Meanwhile the 1% makes a ton of money with everyone using social media, news media commercials, ads, etc. I’ll bet cell phone company stocks will be up on Monday.
1240 2018-07-01 01:20:11 -enacted the travel ban, & enforced laws to keep America safe.
-visits states to talk directly to the people 
-easily the most accessible President ever
-negotiating better trade deals
-prompted billions of investments in USA
-deregulation 
-Stocks, 401k are up.
1241 2018-07-01 01:18:47 And the stocks are in everyone’s 401ks. Which will increase their total portfolio and  p their retirement years. I thought you were a successful businessman?
1242 2018-07-01 01:18:40 CCO are smart business people. They know prices will be higher in future. Makes much more sense to keep it shutdown and force prices higher...precisely what they are going to do. Not much time left to buy U stocks at these prices.
1243 2018-07-01 01:18:36 Zenyatta would smack since beautiful stocks ??   
1244 2018-07-01 01:17:18 Brokers are salespeople. They will want your money regardless of whether you are up or down in the market. Maybe you need to reinvest on other stocks than what your broker recommends.
1245 2018-07-01 01:16:58 Dana, I quit paying dues when the NRA thought Teflon covered “cop-killer” bullets were a good idea. Kind of like bump stocks, silencers and large cap mags. You would be way better at your job if you showed a tiny bit of compassion.
1246 2018-07-01 01:15:28 And if private prison stocks during & after any overhaul of @ICEgov that folks like @SenGillibrand are calling for, be weary because it may just be lipstick on a pig and making the agency more focused on putting these folks behind bars

The revenue increase from the tax cuts are just starting to be realized. Krugman said stocks would crash and 2% max growth

1263 2018-07-01 00:49:16 They don’t care as long as he tears down what remains of the social safety net, gets stocks up, kills healthcare and abortion. The rest they’ll just stand by and watch.
1264 2018-07-01 00:45:42 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your autism

1266 2018-07-01 00:44:36 The only value it presently has is based on stocks, shares and currencies. The underlying social order has been undermined by underhand American actions both in the Middle East and elsewhere. Today it is merely a vassal waiting for the day that the US has a need for it…
1267 2018-07-01 00:44:01 You’re very one dimensional and ignorant of history. You may know stocks and P/E ratios but.....
1268 2018-07-01 00:43:54 Because bump stocks have been used in exactly 0 school shootings. Try having an original thought
1269 2018-07-01 00:39:06 nah this is fake news, I'm sorry but just yesterday I was watching a youtube video on Tesla and its stocks and stuff, and so i scroll to comments and there's kpop stans right there, y'all are omnipotent I swear

1271 2018-07-01 00:38:09 This isn’t the answer. Teachers are pd to teach not be a militia. Start with banning bump stocks, AK’ & AR’s. More parent(s) & teacher involvement in kids lives. Not working 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet.

1286 2018-07-01 00:28:11 Trump just upped military defense spending by 58 billion, planning to increase spending to weapons contractors next year by 85 billion. Weapons manufacturers & defense industry stocks are rising. Not blaming reps or Dems, they’re in bed together when it come to “defense” spending

1299 2018-07-01 00:10:32 Yep. You don’t have to be a talented shot with a AR.  Just pull the ‘trigger’ and destroy everything.  My husband’s dad was a real hunter. One shot for a rabbit dinner. My dad could remake wooden stocks to things of beauty. He knew guns.

1307 2018-07-01 00:04:07 Legal settlements, money won (lottery), stocks, crypto investments.
1308 2018-07-01 00:03:15 There’s already gun safety training in place. Should have better background checks, banning bump stocks is somewhat reasonable

1335 2018-06-30 23:55:34 30 generally oversold and 80 is overbought. I like looking at it on the daily before entry & exits. I find it's the most reliable when a stock has taken a big hit take BABA or FDX for example. I find it unreliable for breakouts or stocks like IQ. I'm sure james has a great method

1353 2018-06-30 23:35:47 What makes me really nervous about pot stocks right now.   The street price of an OZ of MJ.   Currently down to roughly $100 an oz in Massachusetts, so no one is going to dispensaries, just buying from. Local growers...  That's way too low....  Profit margin is suffering.

1362 2018-06-30 23:28:46 A portfolio I would have to recommend to someone who would be self managing after a 1-time fee would have to have:
*Less stocks
*Less small/value diversification
*Use inferior index funds as opposed to asset class funds
*And they’d still prob lose another ~1%/yr thru bad timing

1365 2018-06-30 23:25:39 Reading an article from Marin Katusa, it suggested royalty stocks to play a commodity boom. Is there a royalty stock in the uranium space?
1366 2018-06-30 23:24:25 I'm quite enjoying this "indie" music that they speak of. I might find out if my local Our Price stocks such a thing.
1367 2018-06-30 23:23:54 My dad always stocks the fridge with chocolate milk when I come home. He's the real MVP.
1368 2018-06-30 23:23:13 What does Trump have to do with any of this?  His issues do not absolve her of her corruption!  I am pointing out that she made a mistake to say what she said and should be condemned.  She is also corrupt and ineffective, but I guess its ok for her to get rich with stocks.
1369 2018-06-30 23:21:30 You guys still pushing this lie... Do you have stocks in munitions companies or something???
1370 2018-06-30 23:21:20 The place here stocks it.

1372 2018-06-30 23:15:03 Yeah, I'm reeeeeeally trash. I can't take stocks off of so many people... 
1373 2018-06-30 23:12:35 A bump stock is a totally different thing altogether. It literally makes a semi auto rifle act as a (tiny bit less accurate) fully auto weapon. I agree bump stocks should be banned, but not the gun itself.
1374 2018-06-30 23:11:43 Stocks plunged as Amgen Inc. unveiled a meticulous guilt today.

1379 2018-06-30 23:07:41 Because of the trade tariffs many experts are predicting a recession-dramatic influx of money out of stocks & into bonds occurring now.  More jobs lost than gained (in the millions). If you want to bury your head in the sand then go ahead... I pray for our country everyday.

1387 2018-06-30 22:56:28 Actually it isn’t. Considering bump stocks go up after every mass shooting I would assume she got a huge bonus.  How abt reform on the mntly ill? Instead @DLoesch keeps crying ppl are taking her words outta context but is silent when it’s brought up. We see you. 
1388 2018-06-30 22:56:23 @SonicGoesFast not sure if this is new but, I asked Siri for Bitcoin price and it showed up. Tapping on it opens in in the Stocks app. I could add it to my portfolio.
1389 2018-06-30 22:51:48 You absolutely hold blame in this epidemic, how have you brainwashed yourself to possibly see otherwise? You guys didn't even want bump stocks banned for crying out loud.

1392 2018-06-30 22:49:23 They constantly brag about the stock market, as if they have $ invested in it, but it's just a balloon ready to burst because the tax cuts they love so much pretty much went to corporations buying back their own stocks to create an artificial demand & drive up the price per share

1399 2018-06-30 22:36:35 Start with some common sense firearms regulations? You know, universal background checks, magazine capacity limits, ban bump stocks.....easy stuff.
1400 2018-06-30 22:35:02 Oh please, he will do no such thing.  He will make markets unstable, short stocks to make some cash then pick another target to profit from and create uncertainty. He has a formula.

1403 2018-06-30 22:26:23 how tf do you make those light stocks?
1404 2018-06-30 22:25:53 To all firefighters fighting the moors morons who litter throw lit cigarette butts out of  windows I suggest we bring back stocks in the town square so we know what edjits u are..

1409 2018-06-30 22:22:18 People seem to forget that GE and HD were like 50 and 60x eps too. 10 stocks with large market caps with infinite PE's because the grow REV 30% a year isn't exactly screaming bubble.
1410 2018-06-30 22:21:17 Katusa said?  What did he do when he changed his strategy 2 years ago.  He said find the best then verify they are the best and invest in them and you do NOT need a basket of sector names.  So, he said he shrank from 20 some stocks to just the best of the best for each sector.
1411 2018-06-30 22:21:10 I wonder how much money he made when Pharma stocks went up after delivering that speech? Of course, nobody knows because no one has seen @realDonaldTrump ‘s tax returns. I know. I know. “I’m being audited “.
1412 2018-06-30 22:19:40 Sean, I dont recommend that anyone do what I do.  I just tell people what I do and why.  Very simple.

1420 2018-06-30 22:11:55 Sure, asset is the other side. My point is the gov holding the same dollar as both a liability and an asset is nonsensical. Accounting is a way to track stocks and flows in a manner that is interesting to the one tracking it. Current accounting practices are just a choice.

We need some new data to light the fuse. Some news hopefully soon
1438 2018-06-30 21:48:32 hard to answer, i invested in a lot of coins in early stages and staked since then, for example DEV i bought 2 Nodes on STOCKS when it came out for ~10-20k sat each, since then I staked and setup some more nodes ;-)
1439 2018-06-30 21:45:12 Bump stocks are a plastic device that can be duplicated simply by hooking your thumb in your belt and holding the rifle in the right way. The bump stock ban written by dems is purely designed to ban all short trigger systems don’t be so easily fooled
1440 2018-06-30 21:44:54 Nice. It’s been one of 4-5 stocks I’ve been paying attention to this past month. Actually bought in at close Monday.
1441 2018-06-30 21:43:09 Clearly you have been misinformed. One, the NRA does not lobby to buy their politicians, the ratings are based on a politicians constitutional values.they don’t control anyone,bump stocks are a gimmick any educated gun owner will tell you they are wasteful
1442 2018-06-30 21:42:17 Yes that’s amazing!!

1446 2018-06-30 21:36:29 According to Brugler Report, the Grain Stocks report showed June 1 US corn stocks at 5.306 bbu, higher than the average trade expectation and up 77 mbu vs. last year’s third quarter stocks.
1447 2018-06-30 21:35:19 Just imagine isles fans. Been twitter so much lately I feel like Pres, but without the stocks
1448 2018-06-30 21:33:40 According to Brugler Report, June 1 US soybean stocks were shown by the USDA at a record large 1.222 bbu, in line with the average trade guess and up 258 mbu vs. June 2017.
1449 2018-06-30 21:31:55 If it were true that republicans wanted no crime;
- Trump/Pence would be Impeached
-  NRA would be listed as terrorist organization
- US would have tougher gun laws, banning bump stocks/assault weapons, stronger background checks
- Government Leaders would follow Constitution
1450 2018-06-30 21:30:40 Stocks were likely leeched as usual. Corruption runs deep in Russian Armed Forces.

He's always been a shill and will to his dying day.

1475 2018-06-30 20:50:29 When pennysrock traders claim that algos are manipulating their stock, that is the exact point in which I know they don’t trade. Lol. Algos don’t give shit about your penny stocks. Trust me the data prove that.
1476 2018-06-30 20:48:44 Bump stocks don’t do anything. They’re merely a piece of plastic used as fodder by the ultra-left to scare everybody. Actually use one in real life and you’ll find it greatly hinders the accuracy of the weapon to which it’s attached.
1477 2018-06-30 20:48:34 That I don’t know. I’m told, spring here at least, was wet, so silaging was possible. Though they didn’t have the means to plastic wrap bales so fodder production was very annual. Reduced ability to build up stocks. Could be said Wrapping was a game changer.
1478 2018-06-30 20:46:06 What about having more stocks in the same amount of time? Is the game fast enough to where we can fit in more stocks in a fixed amount of time and have it still be balanced?

1486 2018-06-30 20:39:35 My thoughts exactly, especially good for all the muzzle stuffing going on in a TV drama. P90s and F2000s prove frustratingly useless against androids, even with the funky red stocks.
1487 2018-06-30 20:38:29 Makes sense, the matches don't seem as long basically so it makes sense to fit in more stocks in the limited time. I guess what I was asking was, is there enough time to fit in 4 stocks then? Only those who have played it can tell I guess lol but it had me curious lol
1488 2018-06-30 20:36:54 Gotta find the spot between keeping aggressive characters from making matches less than a minute long and campy characters making matches go to time (which is longer if you have more stocks)

1495 2018-06-30 20:28:48 If you follow the charts on tradingview you can do pretty well , stick to your strategy, sell when overbought, buy when over sold. More likely to work in crypto than stocks. If you don't want to do that, HODL & buy the dips. Best crypto strategy is $100/month in savings portfolio
1496 2018-06-30 20:28:05 That being said, 3 stocks seems more viable due to the devs seemingly trying to remove a lot of “campy” aspects (such as with Sonic, where they removed shield cancellable Spin Dash). We have to start with one or the other, and imo either could work

1583 2018-06-30 19:06:38 I'll be 125!  Got any future stocks I can invest in?  I'd  like to get paid in 2063!
1584 2018-06-30 19:05:59 Only 15-18 stocks bullish, are are either range bound or downtrend, do you advise to increase size in index trade for these two months?
1585 2018-06-30 19:05:36 What do you define as US value stocks in this example?
1586 2018-06-30 19:05:33 Mr Donald Trumps really don't like mexicans my father did same mistake and forgot about our future my father 1915 president for mexico
I have a question?
Where the petroleum stocks foe refinerys go?
And others because we was stupid rich other busyness bone stocks..
1587 2018-06-30 19:05:09 I would be happy if they bought the copper from both #GWMO  and #GGP 

Quids in all for me! 
1588 2018-06-30 19:04:50 Fuck Best Buy....I hope the stocks plummet
1589 2018-06-30 19:04:29 Definitely. Tap shoes + wrestling pants = Magic Ian
1590 2018-06-30 19:01:44 @YahooFinance Why I can’t add polish stocks to @Apple #stock app? :(
1591 2018-06-30 19:01:25 Buy stocks and hold them out of emotional affinity
1592 2018-06-30 19:01:18 Boycott Tesco while it stocks Israeli goods.
1593 2018-06-30 18:59:56 You’re conflating the NRA as an organization with the NRA members. The majority of your membership doesn’t even agree with the NRA platform re background checks, bump stocks, fully automatic weapons, etc.

1596 2018-06-30 18:59:16 Yeah, it's pretty good. On Showtime dealing with stocks and hedge funds. Moreso like "The Big Short" than "Wolf of Wall Street". It just ended its season some weeks ago now.
1597 2018-06-30 18:56:00 I’ve 30x my investment the past 8 months so not sure what your talking about . How about all people loosing their shirts in penny stocks ?
1598 2018-06-30 18:55:12 As likely to happen as Trump voluntarily confessing to his multiple financial crimes.  But this still needs to happen.  Right now, integrity of US markets is way too low w/stocks being spun up by being traded multiple times per second.  Something like this puts the brakes on that
1599 2018-06-30 18:55:06 You can invest in stocks in Grand Theft Auto 5. Sadly individual names only. No index funds

1603 2018-06-30 18:48:55 I want to invest in stocks so bad & I will!
1604 2018-06-30 18:48:03 Tell us again now many days food UK stocks at any one time or how much it can grow to fulfil its needs? Hint, answers are 5 days and 60% respectively
1605 2018-06-30 18:47:29 ON THE FLOOR
1606 2018-06-30 18:47:11 Never, The United States would nearly be land-locked on the west coast. None of the US Citizens should want this.

1608 2018-06-30 18:44:00 They all should.  Their stocks and investment portfolios are killing it
1609 2018-06-30 18:43:18 With some of the trucking costs likely peaking next quarter and stability and predictability of alcohol consumption plus weeeeeeed this one seems like a nice “no worry” stock other than the primary worry for all stocks: “expectations too high broadly”
1610 2018-06-30 18:42:28 This is why it is impossible to gauge actual supply and demand for oil.  Official production and reserve numbers worldwide are cooked and supply itself is manipulated.  This ends up making oil stocks more volatile than they could be.
1611 2018-06-30 18:41:19 And must give up or put on hold : businesses & stocks etc....
1612 2018-06-30 18:38:35 Stocks. Investment. Business
1613 2018-06-30 18:38:21 Cement Stocks? Even if GST is reduced is there a adequate consumption prospect? Housing - what is so buzzing about it? Are there mass scale housing projects running into kms. of townships coming up? Apart from Navi Mumbai Airport voluminousness concreting, name a few more!
1614 2018-06-30 18:37:47 How is it possible that not one single liquor store in #Woonsocket stocks @LabattUSA?
1615 2018-06-30 18:37:27 Agree,  they are different and should not follow the same movements. This is like all stocks should go up and down at same time... 
1616 2018-06-30 18:36:07 For me the #Price is everything. The trend and momentum shows me the direction and duration of my trade. 2018 is a great year for me for finding short selling oportunities on the stocks which is fundemantally broken and sells just dreams like #DeutscheBank and #tesla
1617 2018-06-30 18:36:02 Pure bullshit. Very few got their one time bonus. Wages have not gone up. Gas up stocks down. Healthcare prices up because of getting rid of mandate. You lie daily. Whose happy the very wealthy. You’re ruining our country.
1618 2018-06-30 18:35:56 @TheTimMcGraw 8 out of 10 swamp stocks always at the stage would camp out and your mom made us biscuits at one of them.

1619 2018-06-30 18:31:43 PS5 will have to tank or Stocks start dropping sharply. And I mean like 10-15% for Sony to start considering Crossplay.
1620 2018-06-30 18:30:12 Or an S&P Index like $SPY until you have $10k or more. Then begin with individual stocks after you understand the general markets via the SP 500.
1621 2018-06-30 18:29:42 its better to wait n watch till it gives weekly closing above 1354-1365 range ...IT stocks r showing more power to take #Nifty higher ...wat is ur view on #TataSteel after merger news? my call was purely on rise in #ironore prices...
1622 2018-06-30 18:28:59 4 million people in Ontario self identify as POC, that means 10 million don’t. The proper way to run a business is to hire based on merit, whenever a company announces that they are hiring based on quotas, their stocks plummet.
1623 2018-06-30 18:27:35 stocks ?
1624 2018-06-30 18:26:09 “The gun can’t shoot therefore the gun wasn’t at fault” is about the dumbest logic ever. Cars (up until recently) can’t speed themselves. Crack can’t smoke itself. Stocks can’t inside trade, yet we still have laws on all.
1625 2018-06-30 18:24:18 Anyone know if @HollisterCo stocks up on Must-have Easy T-shirts often?
1626 2018-06-30 18:20:44 It was all we could get done. I work in Finance & was always curious what would happen to the Publicly traded stocks of insurance companies if we went to single payer? 
Roberts believes in precedent. It might not be as cataclysmic as people are saying. Kennedy was a Conservative
1627 2018-06-30 18:20:07 I always thought portable stocks would be appropriate punishments for persons who cause accidents on major thoroughfares during rush hour.
1628 2018-06-30 18:19:20 If you hold $TSLA stocks then by the end of next week you should be in a position to have that problem 
1629 2018-06-30 18:18:43 Do you include if the HCPs were paid in stocks?
1630 2018-06-30 18:18:12 It was a really lovely day! Beautiful weather and so great to see so many of our families having fun and soaking teachers in the stocks  #oldfashionedfun
1631 2018-06-30 18:17:49 Nice buzz words, Steve.  Background checks are required.  Safety training is required for a CPL. ATF just proposed a ban on bump stocks. Anything else?
1632 2018-06-30 18:16:41 Great! 
Would you mind sharing a few more stocks of your portfolio?
1633 2018-06-30 18:16:38 The stats say otherwise.  People no longer have their tax checks held hostage, unemployment is at an all time low, stocks are up, trade is competitive again.
1634 2018-06-30 18:16:36 People are throwing money at the stocks hoping value goes up and get good dividends not him. That's not changing people's lives. Ask an Amazon employee how his life has changed working minimum wage and long hours. Ask a poor person how his life is changed by Bezos avoiding taxes
1635 2018-06-30 18:15:20 Not yet paid for. 4 million verses 247 million. Many big businesses handed out ONE TIME bonuses and then laid off thousands. They used their big tax break to buy back stocks, which disproportionately benefit board members who are big stock holders. #TaxReform #TaxScam
1636 2018-06-30 18:14:41 Met that guy who loves to work in a matchbox environment (remember !) and asked him how he was doing, he said "great". I could not say a word after this, cos if one just went by the price action in most stocks, there was never a reason to "long it" or double down.
1637 2018-06-30 18:13:27 Tested, and made sure they were during different stocks to prevent the multi-dodge nerf from happening.

• As I expected, directional air dodge has about 3x the amount of recovery frames before you can act again. Non-directional air dodge is a little slower than S4's.
1638 2018-06-30 18:11:40 I  love that  your work  dosent depend   on  2 much  stocks   and its pretty clean  i  love it

1640 2018-06-30 18:08:44 Hey boss have u seen anything showing fed draining liquidity with its affect on rates and stocks? Soon they accelerate that distribution so wondering if that’s partial cause for some VOL rising rates falling etc
1641 2018-06-30 18:07:17 Get on board guys... I print MONEY!!
1642 2018-06-30 18:07:01 Perhaps you are in the wrong stocks, because mine have been going up.  Either you don't know what your doing or you should fire your stock manager.  Hint: when Obama became President, a five year old could have taken us out of recession.  Unemployment is the lowest in decades.
1643 2018-06-30 18:06:31 He never promised any of those things. He did ban bump stocks however. If you have evidence of any of him saying those things, post a link below. Also Obama wasted tons and tons of taxpayer money going on trips to Europe, Michelle flying out for a friend of a friends funeral, etc
1644 2018-06-30 18:05:51 Another reason stocks have been wiped out. There is no enforcement by DFO or monitoring of FN fisheries on the Fraser.
1645 2018-06-30 18:05:00 Ok

1653 2018-06-30 17:54:19 @jitenkparmar Your views on steel sector and steel cycle 
How long it will be in uptrend ?
Please revert some views on steel stocks and specifically prakash Industries ?
1654 2018-06-30 17:52:20 @Lowes for the life of me I can't figure out why you do everything possible to convince me to shop @HomeDepot .  Employees ignoring customers standing around talking, out of stocks on sale items, and rude employees who nearly run you down with a flatcart and don't even apologize.
1655 2018-06-30 17:52:05 Surprisingly don't see a word on 'expensive valuation' from you.. even for FMCG you weren't comfortable with more than 30-35 PE so special discount for Bata? 

If yes, on what parameter(s) Bata scores above other high-quality 'high PE' consumer stocks?
1656 2018-06-30 17:50:03 now should ass stocks. Rise. To keep a level playing field  with the vagina ?
1657 2018-06-30 17:47:38 @harleydavidson is leaving. Your tariffs are screwing us. @GM @Ford @Chrysler will shrink its workforce. Our stocks are falling. 
You are moving out companies
1658 2018-06-30 17:47:25 elles sont déjà plus en stocks :(
1659 2018-06-30 17:44:28 They are leaving because of your tariffs. No one wants to do business here because of you.
My stocks are falling. You are screwing with our lives. We are the car makers, we are the steel workers.
1660 2018-06-30 17:43:53 Important to evaluate assumptions may be framing one’s thinking. If one thinks, for example, 8% annual returns in stocks guaranteed over long haul, it limit preparedness if returns fail to materialize. Study *drivers* of price returns to extrapolate, not price returns themselves.
1661 2018-06-30 17:43:30 Nice volume on Friday as well Lis!!! 323,453 strong volume with a close at $1.36.
1662 2018-06-30 17:41:04 GM including others are losing money because of your tariffs. People in Michigan are losing their jobs. Our stocks are down. 
@harleydavidson is leaving. Most parts are made outside the US and built here.
1663 2018-06-30 17:40:06 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1664 2018-06-30 17:40:05 indeed. I see it's all starting to make sense. Nobody can compete with the  vagina . Is king  . so we gotta. Keep vagina stocks low
1665 2018-06-30 17:37:54 My stocks & bonds tho 
1666 2018-06-30 17:36:25 Have you checked the stock market. My stocks are losing money since the tariffs. Companies are going to cut the Big 3 down so thousands will lose jobs. Obama took us out of a recession.
1667 2018-06-30 17:33:21 Which promise did he keep? Did he release his tax returns? Did he ban bump-stocks? Raise age to purchase guns? Fix student debt crisis? Quit playing golf? Stop AT&T merger? Enact term limits? Guaranteed paid leave? Declare China currency manipulator? Sue his sex assault victims?
1668 2018-06-30 17:31:43 Some might need Tylenol when trading OTC stocks.
1669 2018-06-30 17:30:47 I just want to be absolutely clear. I own guns. I like guns. But the #NRA doesn't speak for me. There's no reason to have a 50rd magazine. There's no reason for universal access to bump stocks.
1670 2018-06-30 17:29:58 It's even worse -- it's how she and her husband made all that money --
Most of it w/ the "legal" Congress insider trading rules
Eg They bought all the right healthcare stocks while helping to formulate Obamacare
1671 2018-06-30 17:28:53 Il faut faire des stocks car les prix vont monter !
1672 2018-06-30 17:28:52 Well bump stocks are illegal now.  And the background check states is in fact being looked at in several states.
1673 2018-06-30 17:28:25 Scott claims his stocks went up so he is in the black despite his loss in income from decent people who no longer want to associate with him. Though Trump's words have put the US in worst bear market since 2008 and in 10 days could be since 1984.
1674 2018-06-30 17:27:16 Would you mind giving your opinion on what you see $axxa doing or not doing in the month of July?  I'm still very new to breaking down a stocks' potential and find your analysis to be spot on more times than not. I know you're busy so thanks in advance.
1675 2018-06-30 17:26:13 Thx buddy if you can share Friday I would appreciate it. My buddy has from Wednesday. I can find a way to share that one to you.
1676 2018-06-30 17:22:34 Phase 2 of the tax cuts should be taking back the tax cuts from the Corps who used them to buy backed stocks instead of raising wages & reinvest like we were told they would do.
1677 2018-06-30 17:17:45 You dont need to look at the stocks because when Trump ain't bragging about the market you know it's bad.
1678 2018-06-30 17:17:16 I don’t support this administration or what they stand for, but the hatred for trump should not overshadow ur concern for our country’s economy - stocks being just one measure of it. It was wrong when GOP did it against Obama administration, and it is wrong now if Dems do it.
1679 2018-06-30 17:17:14 Remover when Kanye bought Kim apple stocks .

Lock and Key on this  till then.

1680 2018-06-30 17:14:46 Needle didn't budge on last good ER if I remember correctly.  I don't know if it's time to accumulate crypto based stocks or if it's all over.  #NeedHope
1681 2018-06-30 17:14:24 Short and ultra short high quality bonds - the best long-term compliment to stocks but the worst place to be in the last few decades. Specifically:
25% One-Year Fixed
25% Two-Year Global
25% Short-Term Gov’t
25% Five-Year Global
1682 2018-06-30 17:14:01 did we buy up the stocks of those missiles to stop the argies getting their mitts on them?
1683 2018-06-30 17:13:12 Put all Ammunition stores under close surveillance, establish safety fences  and a 24/24 surveillance. Close all roads giving access to Ammunition stocks except to one strategic road going to that store. Establish a military checkpoint on that road.
1684 2018-06-30 17:13:07 Here's a tip- because I've been doing this 31 years- don't pay any attention to what a lying CEO says, or what a stock price says-  just look at the debt.   Bonds are always smarter than stocks, and the bond price is shouting reorg- works EVERY time.
1685 2018-06-30 17:12:34 hey mate, have only from friday
1686 2018-06-30 17:12:29 #HEG 
Looks like you exited very very early, frustration shows up, it’s OK happens in life, focus on your next idea, if possible share your idea with us, or else still you can allocate some to HEG. Don’t go for ego, I have lost 4-5 multibaggers stocks only bcz of that.
1687 2018-06-30 17:10:42 I got passive money growing in the bank(stocks). I got residual money growing in my team(network marketing) & I got active money in my career (only 2years of schooling)
I took notes from the real rich folks. Not you rich hood rats 
1688 2018-06-30 17:09:42 I don’t trade penny stocks much and use RBC for the rare occasion that I do so haven’t found much issue with it if trading 1-10k shares. The platform and executions are fast/powerful compared to others imo
1689 2018-06-30 17:08:41 So what do you consider stocks? Because your principal definitely isn’t safe!
1690 2018-06-30 17:08:10 Fridayâs rally on Nifty might have caught the bears on the wrong foot; 3 stocks to buy: Fridayâs move again brought the indices into…
1691 2018-06-30 17:06:10 Including bump stocks and automatics?
1692 2018-06-30 17:05:54 Money flow is going into small caps and energy stocks
1693 2018-06-30 17:04:09 I personally believe in great companies at fair price + diversification in 15-20 such stocks will deliver decent return in long run.
1694 2018-06-30 17:02:03 Do you think sell off in non US markets is only due to dollar? Or something else going on? I see so many etfs, stocks breaking below red EMA which is really bearish and leadership in US markets also narrowing.
1695 2018-06-30 17:01:22 From the 3 stocks of my portfolio with $BILI I have more doubts . All depends of the earnings results , next are in August . If everything go well we could see it in $40 in a year . If the earnings are bad or don’t like we could see 5-8$.
1696 2018-06-30 16:57:08 She also had the nerve to educate me on stocks 101 when I used to sell and buy stocks daily.. tried to force me to invest in Big Hit by saying that company is part of the big3 now. Went silent when I mentioned it's not stable and too much of a risk in terms of portfolio diversity
1697 2018-06-30 16:47:50 Trumps tax break makes the rich richer!! There using it  for the parachute package for the CEOS! By buying back there stocks they keep it for themselves!
1698 2018-06-30 16:46:31 Hey! Spineless @NRA lap dog. What's your plan? I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
1699 2018-06-30 16:46:15 And if you want me to put my money where my mouth is, well, I’m waiting for a few points of rebound and then selling half of my stocks
1700 2018-06-30 16:44:58 That is a lie, unsupported by any facts. There were bonuses, but corporate America is using that money to buy back their stocks, not rewarding employees. Wages are flat.  Stop lying
1701 2018-06-30 16:44:27 Most wealthy americans don't want anything to do with the Constitution they have earned their money in fake stock lies deception prison stocks war.

1712 2018-06-30 16:31:00 Winter project= Buy a website domain and start a website... Financial (stocks+crypto) based or Kodi tutorials+IPTV+customizing Shield/Firestick, haven't decided!
1713 2018-06-30 16:30:54 I went to University to understand how grads think. I worked at US investment banks to understand how they think. I sign up for penny stocks courses (2) to understand what they teach. Now I understand the retail psychology. I have my edge. #flowtrades
1714 2018-06-30 16:30:06 Bump stocks were always legal.  Besides I’d rather have someone shoot at me with a bump stock then without cause if you knew anything about shooting you’d know that you have almost no accuracy with a bump stock.
1715 2018-06-30 16:27:31 Thank you to everyone who came along to help and support for our fun day. Was a great day - and I have finally dried out from my trip to the stocks!
1716 2018-06-30 16:27:01 Pwede po bang pakidamihan po ang stocks ng marikina shoes na size 10 or 11... puro size 7 eh  May mga Pilipino din naman pong malaki ang size ng paa huhu
1717 2018-06-30 16:25:18 Home depot is a huge Trump supporter! Sold my stocks, won't go near the place 
1718 2018-06-30 16:23:54 Might as well start investing in stocks
1719 2018-06-30 16:23:28 So you are stocking up for economic reasons, I get it. Since the potential new laws are for background checks, you must have a criminal past? If that isn't it, did you just buy as many AR15s, bump stocks or large capacity magazines as possible?
1720 2018-06-30 16:20:53 Questrade not good for penny stocks or taking away liquidity. Get filled on the bid and ask no ecn fee
1721 2018-06-30 16:19:09 Spare me!  They could have the members w/ an A rating from them write their own legislation banning bump-stocks.  They control both chambers and the WH.
1722 2018-06-30 16:18:36 Apple was bear to   stocks .   
1723 2018-06-30 16:17:48 Hereabouts on the Continent, Aldi still stocks A4 paper, and is open till 2100 (9 pm) on Saturdays...
1724 2018-06-30 16:17:14 Mbappe stocks just went up.
1725 2018-06-30 16:16:46 SK economy is facing:
1. Foreign investor selling SK stocks due to rising interest rates.
2. Export in trouble as USD stronger.
3. $1.5T debt bomb clicking.
4. Energy import cost rising due to higher oil price.
5. Plan to spend on NK while undermining SK economy.
1726 2018-06-30 16:15:53 Had a tough time controlling Portfolio of 4thQtr ending Mar18 pertaining to stocks invested in Feb-Mar18. The Investment stocks ran helter-skelter with undue hurry and confusion and required vigil and swift exits. There were False Signals and numerous SL stop outs. 1/n
1727 2018-06-30 16:14:37 You already know upping production usually causes a price drop so it must be that global stocks are down. Trump is doing it to try to starve Iran of revenue, Saudi only too happy to help.
1728 2018-06-30 16:14:09 you always get all of the stocks lmao! Congrats eric!
1729 2018-06-30 16:14:04 My friendly neighborhood personality won’t last to:

1730 2018-06-30 16:13:55 What happened to banning bump stocks?
1731 2018-06-30 16:13:39 You can do it, B!!!  Budging for food AND stocks!
1732 2018-06-30 16:12:54 Full measure includes the first few words? A well regulated Militia. So, lets do that first. Regulated = background checks, no show loopholes, mandatory licensing, mental health support, no mass murdering tools like bump stocks, etc.  Well regulated. #2a, don't skip the first bit
1733 2018-06-30 16:11:56 Missed this thread..When i was looking at buying GM stocks while back, what I noted was about 35% of it was owned by USG..they have a lot of foreign models (Opal) they manufacture abroad for overseas market..17 factories in PRC..but assemble or manufacture in Detroit for US mkt.
1734 2018-06-30 16:10:40 Lost to Syrox for 33rd, could have had game 2 ;-; But very happily played great and my road to Syrox had some 3 stocks by YA BOY

One of the first times in a while I didnt get upset at a national thank the heavens

Ggs everyone! Pls come money match :3
1735 2018-06-30 16:10:18 With proper funding mechanisms and enough stocks yes. Our gvt need to mobilise more financial resources while @NBSZbloodbank needs to come up with more ways of increasing stocks so that we never run dry. Other countries in the region r doing it. Its possible
1736 2018-06-30 16:10:09 Most sane american republicans dont mind the bans of bump stocks and high capacity mags or stricter backgrounds.......it doesnt change my ability to own
1737 2018-06-30 16:10:06 Wrong. People with a lot of money in stocks will pay for information about economics. It is the only media that you can really charge for.
1738 2018-06-30 16:09:21 Very true

1741 2018-06-30 16:06:31 Then he gained another listing place on the Hong Kong stock exchange in doing so. This alone he's recouped his outlay. Then over a period of time has sourced a new owner. He is known as the king of penny stocks and his record of turning companies around is top class.
1742 2018-06-30 16:05:45 What are you talking about. Anyone with a 401k, IRA, 529, stocks, gold, silver, bonds lol forget bonds. A job, family, home, etc... has a steak in it. We need to fight for better trade deals. If that means spending a few grand more on a Harley then so be it. We will win ...
1743 2018-06-30 16:05:25 Bally good thinking! RMG, *the willy of the people* - how's about flogging, the stocks and bear-baiting, what!
1744 2018-06-30 16:03:19 My understanding is that he has in fact placed his assets in a trust where he is not involved in the businesses or decision making.  These are not stocks or bonds -- his familly is another matter. Jr. & Eric run them, neither are involved in the admin.  Again not my job to defend
1745 2018-06-30 16:01:36 Man put all his stocks and shares into that bad boy
1746 2018-06-30 16:00:58 @Alina_AE Really? i just clicked buy at exact 12:00 PM, then it was sold out? how many stocks did you add to champion of light?
1747 2018-06-30 16:00:01 Many potential things to worry about. Her question was only about stocks above the 200 DMA.
1748 2018-06-30 15:58:37 Why are you not a wrestler? You are wasting your SY dance training... #timestepwrestling
1749 2018-06-30 15:58:06 I just did an attempt at Classic mode in smash 4 and one of the computers picked up one of those stupid blower items and took out both my stocks OK
1750 2018-06-30 15:57:27 I default to the charts (as you do). I’m just saying that traditionally these stocks move on this data.  In terms of risk / reward, I think the risk is to the upside considering the miserable Jun these stocks had.  It’s kinda like the banks going into the stress tests..
1751 2018-06-30 15:56:28 @AnilJISL For example current share prise of Jain irrigation is Rs 76,it wil be eassy to buy an middle level employee ,If 10k employees bought 100 shares each it will become 1000000,per month and increase market cap and volatility can be added to the stocks

1753 2018-06-30 15:53:53 this is a very confusing period for me. I feel my highs and lows way too fast. it's highly volatile, like the stocks of the telecommunication and energy sectors.
1754 2018-06-30 15:53:17 Buybacks mostly help stockholders, but CAN help workers. Many companies have stock purchase plans as a benefit. In addition, most retirement plans work off stocks, where you can buy stocks at LOWER THAN MARKET. So beneficial to those that can take advantage (5/x)
1755 2018-06-30 15:51:39 So what stocks are still good fundamentallly in this space?
1756 2018-06-30 15:51:21 Lol no one even bothered to check the stocks in the back so they kept ordered more of the stocks then dumped them in the backroom instead of working them... 
1757 2018-06-30 15:50:19 While as traders we learn to remove all emotion and that is true. When you’re done trading, know that these prices have real world effects unless you’re trading stocks or crypto. #oott
1758 2018-06-30 15:49:39 Business isn’t booming. Even conservative economists say the tax cuts went to buy stocks and that’s about it. Trump is lying to you.
1759 2018-06-30 15:49:03 It’s fun to watch you fret and worry over all these tweets by responding to them. I can only hope your addiction to petty responses on twitter takes away from your time promoting bump stocks and military style weapons.

1763 2018-06-30 15:42:09 Lol it’s just really going ALL IN. I think I want to try it with a couple lol like blackjack.  I just will set alerts to notify me when the price drops, set sell limits etc.I choose stocks with high volume & I pay attention to the shares outstanding and institutional ownership...

1770 2018-06-30 15:36:36 Bajaj twins... Consumption stocks...
1771 2018-06-30 15:36:15 Except, you know, requiring background checks and gun safety training or banning bump stocks  or bashing the press as the ‘enemy of the people.’ And for the record - It is OUR government you Fascist fuck.

1776 2018-06-30 15:28:30 There are so much digital ink wasted on divining the future direction of the averages.  There is a plethora of opportunities in the individual stocks.  It pays to be highly selective.  @markminervini drills this home continually.
1777 2018-06-30 15:27:55 As usual, no tweets for next several days due to monthly newsletter process.

1791 2018-06-30 15:19:31 I never knew bears loved the Dijon mustard. Makes me wonder why the snack bar at the zoo stocks mustard, seems like the Zoo Keeper has no regard for the safety of his food providing employees
1792 2018-06-30 15:17:55 nope. i waited at 6:00 am actually, i've waited there until 6:20. they restocked it with 10 stocks, when i clicked it, boom. sold out.
1793 2018-06-30 15:16:25 Ghastly defending from Argentina. More worrying is their central midfield stocks if they do advance with Mascherano and Banega out. #FRAARG #WorldCup

talk that juicy to me baby, school me on how to get this money
1796 2018-06-30 15:15:26 Really ? Allowing domestic abusers to legally buy firearms is comment n sense? People who've been committed to mental institutions to buy is common sense? Owning 2 dozen assault rifles and unlimited ammo + bump stocks is common sense?
1797 2018-06-30 15:15:22 Why cause stocks leaves like a little baby over some argument lmao @LittleStocks20 is 20 years old he’s a grown man almost well apparently not lmao
1798 2018-06-30 15:14:29 If bump stocks are trash then you should not care if they were bsnned.

1804 2018-06-30 15:10:39 Investors are no longer protected.

1810 2018-06-30 15:08:45 I’m sure I heard someone near the bar behind the Tavern Concourse just say that cider stocks are running out.

1811 2018-06-30 15:07:08 just keep opening a project up everyday and you should get some ideas now and again, even if you feel like you aren't going to enjoy it, just try and maybe find some stocks and have a quick play around and you'll make something that will look good, then open it the next day etc.
1812 2018-06-30 15:07:02 What's ridiculous is that most gun owners don't own bump stocks as (duh!) ammo costs money and they probably don't want to waste it all in one go.

1815 2018-06-30 15:05:47 These are the biggest drug pushers in the world! I can't help but believe #GEORGESOROS owns many of these Companies or large stocks in them, for He is The person filling the streets in the world with deadly drugs!

1817 2018-06-30 15:03:41 We shouldn't be settling on a job-only life, I mean, position yourself in business and stocks. Because life works that way. And people should learn "in" of earnings. Hindi pagkasweldo, puro out. Aasenso ka lang for a day or two.

1819 2018-06-30 15:02:56 I've never understood coaching. Unless you're telling them to switch characters, what info do you have that's gonna change anything?

See how he has two stocks? And you also have two stocks? Don't lose yours before he loses his.
1820 2018-06-30 15:02:55 Constantly reinforced by data: on average, "experts" don't have a stock-picking edge. "The average actively managed fund focused on U.S. stocks lagged behind the S&P 500 in the decade ended June 30, according to Morningstar data." #investing #stocks #equities

1824 2018-06-30 15:00:10 I saw people on here talking about how much they spend on weed every month.. I was mortified by the amounts I saw but ecstatic since I have weed stocks..
1825 2018-06-30 15:00:04 Maryland requires background checks & bump stocks are banned.  Either law did not keep the sicko from killing 5 in Annapolis.  It is the PERSON not the GUN that committed the crime.

1830 2018-06-30 14:51:19 They already have background checks the universal was something the Dems want to spend to stop sells from individuals. The BATF can still trace the firearm. Bump stocks are trash and the NV guns were jammed bc of.

A 10% market correction was to be expected
Those that buy in at this lower price will create a stronger market base

A correction is healthy
Sophisticated investors will buy in soon

1834 2018-06-30 14:47:05 They have been just about the only Canadian stocks which have performed well.
1835 2018-06-30 14:46:58 Universal background checks are unenforceable. The gov't has no idea who has guns or if and when they are being sold. As we saw with Massachusetts, people will not give up their bump stocks. Even if they did, they can be replaced with a simple rubber band.
1836 2018-06-30 14:46:04 Under trump: record unemployment, businesses coming back to produce in the US, stocks have risen, tax cuts, record MINORITY unemployment. Stop believing what cnn and the view tell you and look up your own facts. The facts are with trump.
1837 2018-06-30 14:45:36 To the man that walked by me at Stocks who grabbed me an another girls ass, & tried sticking his finger up mine. I wish I would’ve seen who you were, because I was ready to punch you in the fucking face. You’re a disgusting, pitiful ass man, and I hope you rot in hell.

1841 2018-06-30 14:41:09 @Emma4Change @cameron_kasky @davidhogg111 Do u know if bump stocks have been banned yet? I know our lying president said he would do it right away, but I have not heard anything since then. I googled it but all I read is States r trying unsuccessfully, Did Trump ban them or not?

1844 2018-06-30 14:40:51 9/11 isn’t even close to a phony, biased investigation, anyone can be under investigation, but guess what, there is no PROOF of any collusion, but I’ll give you proof that there is none, look at the stocks, the amount of companies coming back, and his ability to get work done!
1845 2018-06-30 14:39:37 Not likely they can do it except out of stocks. They can probably do 1mil tops.
1846 2018-06-30 14:38:53 Background checks are required....we used to teach gun safety and respect in schools but Dems got rid of that...bump stocks are rarely ever used so why focus on the 1%...and press that does nothing but reports false/misrepresented content is not doing the people any favors
1847 2018-06-30 14:37:41 Many thanks to Kate Starling for the generous donation of rugs. Proceeds will go towards our winter hay stocks.
1848 2018-06-30 14:36:09 Really appreciate what you're doing in the stocks and options trading world
1849 2018-06-30 14:35:41 Stocks are short-term oversold and new money comes in during the first of the quarter so we could see a bounce....
1850 2018-06-30 14:34:54 The NRA has blocked every attempt to require background checks and gun safety training or banning bump stocks.  The NRA supports someone, with no training, but legally blind owning a gun.
1851 2018-06-30 14:34:04 OPEC increased production in 2009-2015, caused a huge drop in global prices across the board from Crude to gas at the pump. This took the brakes off of the US economic recovery. That was good for US. It also caused US oil companies to lose a fortune. Bad for them. Bad for stocks!

1857 2018-06-30 14:28:57 It’s smarter to own ETF’s than mutual funds for sure given the dramatically lower annual fees.  Longer term though, millennials would be well served to also invest directly in individual stocks.  Despite more variability in outcomes, higher returns more likely on average.
1858 2018-06-30 14:28:56 .... Allá cada cuál...Pero vosotros como marca que os debéis a vuestr@s client@s no podéis poner a la venta esos ridículos stocks, cuando sabéis que se iban a agotar rápidamente. Lo peor no es el robot, sino que hablo de 1a mano por mi padre, persona mayor....

1863 2018-06-30 14:26:20 @amit_jeswani all your shares in deep red.
Not even your single share is green and you are just exiting stocks in losses like capacite infra and PNB Housing.
Now DBL also running in losses now.
Your team not even giving satisfactory replies
1864 2018-06-30 14:25:54 You really do so much better in smash so long as you maintain a mindset of "This is my house, I run this place".

It's too easy to get hit by big punishing hits/combos and all of a sudden not want to force your will on your opponent. Especially in a game with only two stocks.

1868 2018-06-30 14:22:56 'stocks for the long run'
1869 2018-06-30 14:22:51 Don’t spend your money on that nonsense.

Buy stocks, or real estate.
1870 2018-06-30 14:22:48 No need.  Studies have shown that whenever a company embraces a social-justice policy, it starts to lose market share.  In fact, a good bet would be to short Virgin stocks and, as the price plummets, you make money (NB: not investment advice)...
1871 2018-06-30 14:21:56 Andrew, I wonder if the report was a paper exercise rather than an actual inspection. Was all the inventory tested on the day? Did guns fire? What stocks of ammunition? Do the aircraft have armaments? It would not surprise me if the process is to rob Peter to pay Paul for spares.
1872 2018-06-30 14:20:12 My opinion on stocks and trading is just that, its just an opinion, no one has the answers but i do have good intentions, to me these are just stock symbols and i trade movements, thats it, whther its a 20% gain or a +2,000% gain i just trade the trade as it allows me to > Thanks

1878 2018-06-30 14:16:29 Shoeshine boys were in the best position to see the crash coming (outsiders looking in). They had 100s of brokers everyday talking to them about stocks. The boys were able to see the bigger picture unfolding that the brokers couldn't see.
1879 2018-06-30 14:15:09 And due to your little tariff war companies might be looking at letting people go. Oh yeah and your tax cut let companies buy back stocks, inflate the prices and make the rich richer.

1885 2018-06-30 14:13:22 Sell gun stocks.  When the fear of regulation subsides with Trump’s next gun-nut SCOTUS appointment, panic 2A gun buying will end.  In fact, you should sell short some gun stocks that you don’t own. @shannonrwatts @MomsDemand #Basta #BlueTsunami2018 #dateline
1886 2018-06-30 14:12:14 Think so too. In my view would also fuel the final leg up in stocks.
1887 2018-06-30 14:11:57 Lots of juicy stocks setting up to buy, but not yet.

1889 2018-06-30 14:10:28 this release seems too easy. Reports of low stocks are assuming false. I believe stock is similar to creams.
1890 2018-06-30 14:10:15 You're right. Generally, above-normal stocks indicate more days of coverage. Recently at ~20 days on average. This may go down, as it's getting hotter.

1908 2018-06-30 13:55:46 No they don’t, all they do is buy back their stocks, trickle down has never worked.
1909 2018-06-30 13:55:26 this year is of large caps. midcaps only if u are betting on a particular company. But SIPs are a great opportunity this year in small cap funds. choose only high quality stocks.

1911 2018-06-30 13:49:30 Nicky B still posting denials about gun violence in america? We have 300 million largely unregulated guns in america. The NRA opposes gun safety registration. for instance, they still support bump stocks. I strongly recommend you research gun violence using Google. Thanks
1912 2018-06-30 13:48:17 @POTUS was also going to ban bump stocks, raise the age to 21 to buy guns...he never did, it was all lies. He's the. #LiarInChief, he says what he thinks the democrats wants to hears and then he trashes them.

1915 2018-06-30 13:45:14 You can hedge against that today by investing in stocks.  Do you think an investment in an s&p, djia index fund is not a bet against inflation or wot ?  All the us corporations and their moat ain’t gonna evaporate overnight
1916 2018-06-30 13:45:09 What happened to the ban on bump stocks like 45 promised?
1917 2018-06-30 13:42:53 How about we not spread fake news. The HRC selling uranium thing is as fake as they get. A committee of 9 people voted to approve a sale of stocks in a Canadian Mining Company. She could not do it alone or block it even. Ok, maybe fact check first.
1918 2018-06-30 13:42:24 How come my own stocks and everyone I know's stocks all went up then? How come my friends are all earning more? Are we missing something?
1919 2018-06-30 13:42:13 I think their stocks just sent up....
1920 2018-06-30 13:41:59 Liquidating stocks? One thing for sure Bank of America made lot of money on its clients! I do my own investing decisions & use Fidelity for executing my trades. But I am educated in finance unlike most.

1928 2018-06-30 13:36:07 Also 0-2 at the local again. Even though I should've lost game 2 in losers, I got to game 3 in both sets but I play so much worse in bracket because I'm to anxious so I can never win even though I probably could. Set 1 I got cycloned at 20% when he had 120% on our last stocks.

1931 2018-06-30 13:35:22 Modding a semi to burst fire or full auto is already a federal felony and states outlaw it too.

Doing so and using for further crimes is statistically very very rare per the FBI.

Bump stocks, though not yet illegal, are just crap. A useless gimmick that fvcks with accuracy.
1932 2018-06-30 13:34:38 Closely relates to which number of stocks you’re comfortable holding. Do you have a max number or just keep adding new stocks?
1933 2018-06-30 13:32:18 Changes were made in MA. The MA legislature moved quickly and banned bump stocks.
1934 2018-06-30 13:32:03 It does not have momentum. So not my kind of setup.
1935 2018-06-30 13:30:17 And those strategic stocks will not come from the United States, according to US Energy Secretary Rick Perry

1938 2018-06-30 13:29:54 Exactly. But the "Fudds" out there think we can give them bump stocks, and maybe M855 ammo, and if they keep pushing we'll give them ARs and AKs. But they'll never be happy until they have us completely defenseless.
1939 2018-06-30 13:29:44 Squeeze glocks for stocks!
1940 2018-06-30 13:28:20 On most? Look at the average growth of stocks on main market/junior market in 2016/17 and compare it to interest rates then.
1941 2018-06-30 13:27:31 Agree, but it always amazes me how little the carry over stocks of wheat is.

I think that the last big hike in wheat price (£200/t) was caused when wheat carry over stocks went below 52 days or similar
1942 2018-06-30 13:26:42 I have a bachelors in economics and formerly worked as an investment banker where I would convince my dumb ass conservative clients to buy stocks at the peak and sell the dip. I make more money squirting soap in the bathroom than I ever made at Merrill Lynch
1943 2018-06-30 13:23:16 I’ll continue to say that ERC20 is bullshit until they are given the same type of setup that stocks have. I welcome the SEC securities label and regulations for what is a completely centralized market. 

Decentralized blockchain or gtfo.
1944 2018-06-30 13:23:13 is there any hope that you would bring these to smash, should stocks last?

This week, margins were increased on certain volatile stocks, which added more fuel to the fire, leading to a sudden selloff in midcaps and smallcaps. However, this will not sustain going forward and things will settle down soon.

1959 2018-06-30 13:11:51 I am nice, he was being misleading and the stocks were in the tank a year and a half ago. Trumps made him even more wealthy than he was.
1960 2018-06-30 13:10:32 I like how you are being honest about underperforming the market. It's not an easy game. If prices of valued stocks can get back to their values in a short period of time, they are less likely to be valued stocks in the first place.

1964 2018-06-30 13:04:18 I do not read others opinions about my stocks , have learnt to ignore
1965 2018-06-30 13:04:08 Federal background checks are required, bump stocks are not readily used but wouldn’t be a bad idea to an them, and how would gun safety training prevent shootings? It wouldn’t take the evil out of them.

1972 2018-06-30 12:57:24 That’s my point too, depends on how you feel the market and your risk tolerance. I’m saving some cash on the sidelines for future business/market opportunities at the moment. If the market slides and all you have is stocks/bonds on your hands you’re screwed.

1989 2018-06-30 12:43:24 Ampio pharmaceuticals stock has never done me wrong. Very under valued stock in my opinion. I got my stocks at .89¢ took that tactic from @WarrenBuffett himself.
1990 2018-06-30 12:43:04 Exactly! If u trusted ur research to invest that’s your decision, none of my friends wanna touch crypto/xrp I said ok and that’s it,they all do stocks but it’s the education people lacking in blockchain-bitcoin is a “bubble/scam” to everyone I know-they don’t understand use case
1991 2018-06-30 12:40:45 Now that's customer service! I mentioned to the lady who runs my LGS that I've joined Slimming World.

1994 2018-06-30 12:39:32 1st-6M Americans is less then 10% our population. 2nd-as a business owner & part of many small bus groups I can tell u, this tax break did NOT dent wallets. Fact of the Fortune 500, less then 10 passed down savings to employees. All others admit they reinvested into stocks.
1995 2018-06-30 12:37:19 Though I’d add the Vermont NRA is probably VERY different from the National NRA. More Birkenstocks, less bump-stocks.

2000 2018-06-30 12:31:52 I haven't followed the so called Looting but I doubt people would just go and pick up money from a bank without any procedure. This is not like Steinhoff where people could arbitrarily buy and sell stocks, do creative accounting and finance their best lives.
2001 2018-06-30 12:31:04 you do realize that sane normal people operate on the principle that you get out of something before it is fucked?  People like you are why the stock market keeps operating - "i'll hold onto this until things go bad, oh why does no one want my stocks?"
2002 2018-06-30 12:30:04 He is a disaster. Bloomberg 99.1 biz radio discusses the policies in depth and the effects. Recession signs because of tariff fight w China. All major auto stocks down. His policies are from the 80’s.  Uh it’s a lot more complicated. Obvious economy is not his strong point

Look at most active unheard of stocks. Look up the company online (Yes Mary, Google it). Talk to Investor Relations

2008 2018-06-30 12:23:35 Dry ice for medical use was my first concern (preserving blood stocks/organs for transplant too).  But it may prompt some to actually try to make their own crumpets, if you're looking for a silver lining.

2026 2018-06-30 12:07:05 Thanks, for the article. The stock popped on Friday, but their dividends are taxed as they are paid. This is not case with other Canadian stocks like CNI and TD. Have you come across this in your research?
2027 2018-06-30 12:06:51 Really foolish. Trump did ban bump stocks, which Obama & the Dems never did. And there is no evidence that any of your points would have saved a single life. Plus, why didn't the Dems do anything when they owned the House, Senate (filibuster-proof majority) & White House?

2030 2018-06-30 12:04:14 Saudi A. can use some of its stocks to boost exports (visible to the US President) while it takes the time to ramp up operating capacity. a reduction of Saudi stocks through export boost is better than the use of the US SPR in the strategy to squeeze Iran out.

2037 2018-06-30 11:58:24 Yeah Timothy they did approve the banning and Obama was the one that allowed bump stocks to be sold which is odd. Also there are gun background checks. I’m not sure Steve’s point on this one

2039 2018-06-30 11:53:57 I've been investing for over 4yrs now. Only got 3 stocks left that i bought in my 1st yr that i am still holding. Most were just not good enough to last the distance or became too expensive & I sold.Even these are left only bcoz i chose to ignore valuations & potential drawdowns.
2040 2018-06-30 11:53:29 @MichWolverine13 @FaceTheNation it's all because of bump stocks!
2041 2018-06-30 11:51:02 But stocks much easier to pick winners, less contributing factors to price changes
2042 2018-06-30 11:49:52 I have the confidence to Buy Mid/Smallcap stocks inspite of a huge fall everyday because i know I don’t have the capability to catch the bottom and they will eventually bottom out sooner or later.
People who wish to buy the bottom or sell the top always keep waiting and can’t act
2043 2018-06-30 11:48:06 No.
Broadly speaking, the wealthy make their income from investments. The article directly discusses their investment gains.

In the U.S., the top 1% own 50% of all stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. The bottom 50% of Americans own 0.5%. Market gains are not equally distributed.

2093 2018-06-30 10:48:13 続いて上期の結果。

【日本株】
残高は+200万だけど、増資が190万なのでかろうじて勝った程度。リミポがでかかった。

【豪株】
残高+2,000ドルで増資が5,000ドル。3,000ドルも負けてるとは知らなかった。。。まあ、こちらは帰国後も見据えて配当が入ればいいってことで(白目)
2094 2018-06-30 10:47:10 When Amazon bought Wholefoods, the valuation of food retailers dropped 15%, it didn't take long for them to come back up. Same thing is happening with healthcare stocks, Amazon just bought PillPack for 1billion$, and healthcare stocks have dropped %10 #buylow
2095 2018-06-30 10:46:44 That’s stocks, Europeans invested them for Europeans. Sorry that not stealing is so difficult for you all.
2096 2018-06-30 10:46:38 I think money is just being invested somewhere else, don't forget millennials would like to become millionaires quick, they are probably throwing their money into basement start-ups (nothing wrong). Most of my friends would rather start a company than invest in stocks.
2097 2018-06-30 10:43:26 Agree
2098 2018-06-30 10:41:27 Incredible that, in this 24/7 online society, that cash can be erroneously sent and then disappear. 

Feels like there's a way but not a will.

Received a letter from sols yesterday and closing line was 'we will not change our bank details' ... They're even preemptimg the issue.
2099 2018-06-30 10:39:30 野球は今日は置いといて、、

まずは6月の投資成績
【日本株】
資産残高は前月末比+68万。ただし、70万増資してるので実質マイナス2万。ラサ工業で勝った分が大きいものの、月末の急落は直撃orz

【豪株】
資産残高は前月比マイナス1,000ドル。手数料が高いので売買してないが、時価急落。。
2100 2018-06-30 10:37:30 Yes, for instance, Pres Trump owns stocks. The stock market is doing well. Stocks he owns are doing well. Therefore, Pres Trump is making money in the stock market, so his 2000 statement can be correct & it's 100% legal!

2105 2018-06-30 10:33:36 As all the eyes of the beholder lock onto you, you feel an intense pressure building in the air.

2106 2018-06-30 10:32:39 Pests like Mirwaiz should have been taken out decade ago either by black ops or by clear ECs, it's a shame that we allowed this rodent to eat our stocks.
2107 2018-06-30 10:31:50 Would be interesting to see debt levels of state, corporates and population to see whether that is potentially one reason (i.e. is growth elsewhere based on debt levels rising)? 

Not suggesting it is, just a thought.

2110 2018-06-30 10:28:26 There are many stocks which are 'better' than ITC. But ITC has a well diversified portfolio of businesses, which will deliver in time. Please remember, stockmarket returns are clustered, not linear like FDs.

2119 2018-06-30 10:16:17 Also why does USA have to be the one to physically and financially meet the needs of the counties literally on the other side of the world!!?!!

2120 2018-06-30 10:13:45 Stocks which fall for technical reasons, can bounce back for sure. However, stocks which fall huge because of company-particular reasons, do surely face issues. One thing I have learnt is that companies which are relatively new, do seldom recover after such a fall.

2130 2018-06-30 10:04:44 Three important words ‘seldom’ and ‘without reason’ and ‘50%+’ Stocks that fall because of bad results go back when results are good. Anyways, a lot of stocks fell 60% in 2008 and then recovered but there was a reason - what I wrote above is the probability not a rule.
2131 2018-06-30 10:03:38 Tu payes en grande partie le coût du service sur TGV (petite quantité vendue, gestion des stocks, personnel...) donc c’est pas deconnant. Et surtout maintenant c’est bon. Avant c’était pas bcp moins cher et bien moins qualitatif en revanche !
2132 2018-06-30 10:01:46 Typically these crashes start in euphoria with Chinese stocks at P/E 35 or so. Missing this even technically the chart looks terrible.
2133 2018-06-30 10:00:22 I do think a lot of private investors underestimate blue chip stocks. In reality they are a lot easier to make money from with patience.

2138 2018-06-30 09:54:29 That’s not really the point is it. I should not have been able to accept  the offer on Sparks  if it was not available. Also you should not make it available to so many people if your stocks are clearly only very limited, which makes it something of a non-offer.

Initially that's what I put but I'd suggest 'any' would equate to advice... 'Typical' leaves enough wiggle room not to be sued and not to be seen as advice.

2186 2018-06-30 08:37:14 I would think because water stocks are likely a capped, relatively unlimited resource with shortage risk at specific points in time. Water saved when there is plenty of water wouldn't lead to an increase in water stocks for later - it's dependent on reservoir space.

2222 2018-06-30 07:38:21 This is like the old municipal bonds v. stocks question. How do you like your investment income? Slow and steady or in risky bunches (or none at all)? I know at least one bond investor who can show that he was better off doing the slow and steady... (without risk)
2223 2018-06-30 07:36:41 I would love to buy stocks from SpaceX one day. Such a great compony! Well done Elon Musk

When yields on long-term government bonds exceed the dividend yield of the S& P 500 by 6 percent or more, sell your stocks and buy bonds. (US context)
2237 2018-06-30 07:17:02 What I don’t get is how can the World stocks loose $10 Trillion is 6 months and no negative economic side affects are felt world wide? I mean is 10 Trillion just a drop in a bucket and no one will notice?

2269 2018-06-30 06:39:36 I know is sounds crazy to guys who do not follow gold and silver stocks, but my take is the five years ( 2013 -18 ) inverted H&S pattern and the 2.5 years triangle pattern in gold both are ending now and we should see USD 1800 in a breath taking rally by end 2018/ early 2019.

"Stocks peaked in Jan, are your policies ending the bull market?" would be a great question but they don't effing ASK good questions!

2276 2018-06-30 06:32:34 Great example — plenty of things that can be wrong with that: My store clerk stocks them onto shelves at our Diabetic Delights store and we get sued by a customer which triggers us to sue you after it is found you shipped non-Diabetic candy to us by no request of our own.

2280 2018-06-30 06:28:53 Yeah, that stock is up in after market hours, and is prime for a good day if also up in pre market. I just don't like the relatively low volume compared to stocks like $PED, as I'd like to see high activity to make quicker trades. More movement basically.
2281 2018-06-30 06:27:42 & don’t forget dollar is at 68-69 & thr 70% revenue comes from export if cotton prices corrected except nice results from trident with re-payment of debt.. So this quater results will clear the picture for all d stocks so waiting for them eagerly

2. Every Monday, before market opens, run the Weekly Chart Analysis

2297 2018-06-30 06:09:22 As long as you are well diversified (15 to 20 companies) among quality stocks and willing to hold not less than 10 years; the risk of permanent loss of capital is very less.

2306 2018-06-30 05:56:14 Just want to know what positive thing he did for you, I have many negatives, father lost part of Medicaid, friends jobs moved overseas, family members lost healthcare, gas went up, my stocks nosedived, how were you affected
2307 2018-06-30 05:54:28 Not all stocks perform all the time. For example, in my stock portfolio, ITC and CRISIL have not given any returns over last 3 years. I wouldn’t mind if it does not give for another 3 years also. Their fundamental long term story has not changed. So I just keep adding.
2308 2018-06-30 05:54:21 1: time to unpack the whole $AKBA, $KERX mess. Why did they merge? Why did the stocks fall almost 20% on the news? Why did the stock recover? What does this mean for $FGEN (if anything)?
2309 2018-06-30 05:53:29 How do you decide Incremental money invested in underperforming stocks
2310 2018-06-30 05:52:40 Not sure how much he can influence debate given the manner of his departure. I suppose if he won the J-League his stocks would be high and credibility strong, but he lost a lot of goodwill over the way he quit the national team.

2321 2018-06-30 05:40:09 Who approved bump stocks??

Who removed the approval of bump stocks?
2322 2018-06-30 05:38:19 So buy stocks...
2323 2018-06-30 05:36:14 Thought the banning of bump stocks was approved?
2324 2018-06-30 05:36:01 We are constantly working towards bringing more and more stocks for our users. Rest assured, we will make positive progress and get this sorted at the earliest.
2325 2018-06-30 05:35:37 Decline in stocks is not a surprising event. It recurs. 

If you live in cold climate, you expect freezing temp & when it drops below zero you don't think of this as the beginning of the next ice age. You know summer will be warm again. 

Good Stocks do the same.

2344 2018-06-30 05:04:22 $AVZ will never get to production. Give it 6-12 months and the HC and Twitter forums will be a wasteland. Happens all too often with stocks like this.
2345 2018-06-30 05:03:59 Are they telling us to  invest in US stocks and bonds^
2346 2018-06-30 05:03:55 Yeah u all used that term to make rifle like the AK and ar (the so called Gun's that can kill millions in a minute) making it seem so bad even though guns like the m-14 and older AK are fine because they have wooden stocks.
2347 2018-06-30 05:03:19 You must be 1%. Ur  tempory tax cut off-set by rising costs(Tariffs,Gas,Healthcare). Perment tax cut benefits Trump Family & Corps who took the money to buy back stocks(no trickle down). Now cut Social Security & Medicare (People money) to pay for rich tax cut. You've been conned
2348 2018-06-30 05:03:13 except banning bump stocks does nothing and will changing nothing.  Steve, learn about guns before you run your mouth.

2350 2018-06-30 05:02:40 Wait, who’s administration approved bump stocks? Stop blaming Trump for what he inherited and be accurate
2351 2018-06-30 05:01:01 Bear markets will produce wealth for patient investors and test the behaviour of wealth managers, investors either want to sell or regret buying high,this is so intriguing as you can’t expect stocks to just keep going up. Don’t worry you have company. Everyone behaves similarly.
2352 2018-06-30 04:58:49 It seemed like yesterday Carl Icahn made 31 million dollars trading steel stocks a week before Trump announced tariffs. 

Now just like Rudy's MIA from the airwaves Carl Icahn went underground
2353 2018-06-30 04:56:37 Thing is, average day niggas really do get rich off parlay, stocks and insurance... legally
2354 2018-06-30 04:54:38 Those who cannot bifurcate their political bias with market bias - God save them.
I personally know few who are long stocks short Mo and its good for them

Markets don't see Maun NaMo or RaGa, they want Clarity and Clarity alone (case 2014)
2355 2018-06-30 04:54:09 News moves the stocks..... :)    intraday trader must watch tv  to see reactions and make money using experience.
2356 2018-06-30 04:54:08 Assume you invested $50 equally into US Nifty Fifty in 1972. The $3 representing Wal-Mart, Philip Morris& Anheuser-Busch alone gave higher returns than $50 invested in S&P 500. Remember we're completely ignoring other 47, out of which sizeable stocks became great wealth creators.
2357 2018-06-30 04:50:53 I wish some of these wonderful creative people I see often on here got as many retweets and likes as some yahoo who's angry about bump stocks being restricted.
2358 2018-06-30 04:50:20  Have a look these #stocks that reached all-time highs: $INFY
2359 2018-06-30 04:49:30 Out of Nifty 50, we also do not take into account how much stocks like Walt Disney, Procter and Gamble, PepsiCo delivered in subsequent decades despite being bought at high valuations.
2360 2018-06-30 04:47:03 An 11% Loss Greets Funds Buying Ant Stocks for First Time
2361 2018-06-30 04:46:37 A miracle! I found a DVD store in Melbourne that stocks the Criterion Collection  BUT they are like $50 because they are imported and you need to check what regions your DVD player can play because they are from the US.
2362 2018-06-30 04:45:12 Once I start making real money off of my stocks Ima start tweeting like Diddy
2363 2018-06-30 04:38:50 Elon gate-keeps expenses now. He is simply not signing checks for stocks of parts.
You don’t order one part from a supplier (or make one) you must order a batch, and stock them. Logistics are expensive too. Early 2018 it dawned on Tesla they can’t afford this.
2364 2018-06-30 04:38:42 Polls are only as accurate as the questions are phrased. The NRA speaks for it's members and they support ENFORCING the current laws not making new ones, with the possible minor exception of banning bump stocks.
2365 2018-06-30 04:38:00 Yup, but why no one said same thing when sensex was same and stocks gave 100-300% returns last yr! One's comfort?!
2366 2018-06-30 04:37:38 And this is for liquid stocks like TataSteel and HDFCBANK
2367 2018-06-30 04:37:33 First of all,  marami donors ang simbahan and some of them had trust funds because people who wanted to help does this.  Wala ka magagawa kung gusto ng tao magdonate sa simabahan.  Secondly, bagsak ang stocks ntin,  kulelat sa lahat.  Same sa peso at bagsak na exports
2368 2018-06-30 04:37:15 Well don’t forget the cost of food going up.. I mean... that’s gonna sky rocket right quick... but ladder stocks are gonna sky rocket as well so I’ve got that goin for me
2369 2018-06-30 04:36:57 Ano stocks nyo dyan? Pautang nga hahaha
2370 2018-06-30 04:35:30 Yoko is a cyclops who trades stocks on the weekends.
2371 2018-06-30 04:33:56 So now we have to ban bumpless stocks?
2372 2018-06-30 04:32:23 What if we are fully invested? Should we just remain invested or rotate to better stocks or sell stocks  and start doing sip??
2373 2018-06-30 04:32:03 Ayaw ko ng magbilang ng stocks
2374 2018-06-30 04:29:25 And how long until legislation is passed limiting all of those labeled with mental disorders or prescription drug bans? F bump stocks. You can do as much with a rubber band or your finger. “No offense”
2375 2018-06-30 04:27:05 Turnage Elizabeth can we have a business meeting? So you can show me how to invest in stocks?
2376 2018-06-30 04:24:51 This is allowed but Newfoundland and Labrador have been banned from exporting seal meat for food and hides for clothing while seals consume millions of kilos of cod / caplain fish per day and are endangering fish stocks on which whales , dolphins and other species depend for food
2377 2018-06-30 04:24:29 If you're blaming this past week's "trade wars" on losing money in the market, you're doing it wrong. #trading #stocks
2378 2018-06-30 04:24:01 If my stocks are out of favour as yours and I am heavily invested in that stock getting no suitable exit.. how could I make a fresh start.. from where money comes... one can't be in a perpetual buying mode without exit
2379 2018-06-30 04:23:46 For many #Investing is hard work. 

For me it's almost zero work. 

I chose some 8 stocks as "core" in 2012-13. Removed 2 of them & added 4 more (mostly around demonetization) in the last 5 years. 

Now the 12 stocks are "locked" for the next 8-10 years with avg ~1 change/year.
2380 2018-06-30 04:23:33 My pay was increased, stocks, 401 are doing well.. 40% seems high that's almost 1/2 population..i call b's on that.. hiring signs all over..get a job then u will benefit too..o that's right..ur the group that wants a hand out..
2381 2018-06-30 04:21:22 This bounce back can be a litmus test for quality ( what market thinks is quality ) in my view.
Example : welspun enterprise 8% up both days yesterday and today whereas DBL 5% LC both days.

Other stocks like Lt foods , rain , radico ,jkil , sunteck bouncing back well 
2382 2018-06-30 04:20:49 I don't invest in cannabis stocks because the financials are too speculative and therefore it doesn't meet my personal investment philosophy. I don't invest in Bitcoin because they have infomercials about it. I don't understand it, I don't think it will be around for long.
2383 2018-06-30 04:20:23 Daming stocks!
2384 2018-06-30 04:17:02 Profiteers are always ecstatic at news of possible war, buying the stocks of military contractors hand over fist at the smallest hint of war

2386 2018-06-30 04:15:20 Trump is a liar. Remember when he said he was going to ban bump stocks? and how he would lower drug prices? and reduce the deficit? and how he didn't know about the Stormy Daniels payments? and how he didn't help write the memo about Donald Jr's meeting with the Russians?
2387 2018-06-30 04:15:17 bump stocks?
2388 2018-06-30 04:14:10 There is a belief that only esoteric and under researched stocks can create wealth. Obvious names with long run way of growth can equally create wealth. Somehow we shun simple ideas and chase complexity.
2389 2018-06-30 04:13:44 My parents to me when I tell them I’m going to switch to Android xD we got stocks in Apple

2391 2018-06-30 04:10:17 In light of the recent impacts of tRump’s fantastic, amazing tariffs and “international policy”, how likely is it that it’s all to manipulate stock prices down so he and his spawn could make bank on shorting US stocks? Def horrible enuf but are ANY of them smart enuf to do it?

2396 2018-06-30 04:00:56 Average return is still 106% for all stocks on #goldenrunway as per Louis James. Sample size +100.

2398 2018-06-30 03:57:48 So, I am thinking AI will lead to unprecedented corporate growth & profit at the expense of human labor. One way to offset/mitigate damaging effects of automation to individuals is to get a piece of pie and dive into corporation high revenues through stocks.

2402 2018-06-30 03:56:54 Stock markets go up and down I don't play with stocks that much other than what the Company matches. My 18% goes into my fixed fund it doesn't lose it only accumulates Interest. My 6% matched goes into stocks it's all recovered +45%on top of that. 
So really I never lost a thing

2404 2018-06-30 03:56:25 By Xmas stocks will be 4 digits. Obama go them up from 8000 in 2009 to 19000 in 2017. Trump lies every day. Zero credibility. No country called to negotiate. No iron foundries being built. No remains brought back from North Korea. No parents of Korean War soldiers approached him.

2416 2018-06-30 03:43:56 That is absolutely disgusting!!!  How can anybody think that that is okay behaviour.  I hope they catch them but, unfortunately, they won't be dealt with as I would like!!!!  Bring back the stocks and public floggings!!!!!

2426 2018-06-30 03:29:08 @marcus760rbx Will Eb have a stock market. So niggas can invest at the stock market or in their cribs. The stocks can be named and It'll go up and down daily. Like for example. If someone has a gun and they kill someone with it. The gun's stock will go down. Just asking.
2427 2018-06-30 03:28:17 Hmm that is interesting. No company Called Quanta Capital is registered in Australia and this is not the Quanta at Hotcopper but both are interested in the same stocks

2431 2018-06-30 03:23:42 When stocks we favour go out of favour

And we never favour whats out of favour

The only favour we can do ourselves is get rid of our favouritism and make a fresh start.
2432 2018-06-30 03:22:41 Alhamdulillah paid for everything!!! I just hope they still have stocks for the carat bong and keyring!! Plus the concert ticket  I'm crying tears of joy 
2433 2018-06-30 03:22:35 EXCEPT, wages are not rising. Companies are taking their tax cuts and using them to buy back stocks and pay sharer holders but not using them to pay workers more. But you’re wealthy, so you don’t care about the workers.
2434 2018-06-30 03:21:19 Well .. I don’t think I’ll be challenging the Koopa King any time soon . Two stocks won’t matter when I’m a broken mess I’m sure.
2435 2018-06-30 03:19:52 It's a big picture effect.  QT causes supply and rates to rise. Unlike stocks, treasuries provide a guaranteed return.  At some point the insurance companies and pension funds like the return.  They sell stocks and buy treasuries bring the yield down.
2436 2018-06-30 03:19:28 Haha this nigga... Nah I'm mean something that would bring a profit. Like stocks or something
2437 2018-06-30 03:16:16 High Risk / High Reward in the market period i mean goodness cryptos have taken a beating and big boards love to announce thinhgs after hours where the stocks can plummet and otc is just a dang jungle its in a category of its own.
2438 2018-06-30 03:15:30 No semi-automatic weapons are needed by people other than military and police.  The same with bump stocks, and large capacity magazines.
2439 2018-06-30 03:15:26 $NFLX at 250x~ EPS | EV/OP at 175x. If $NFLX increased earnings 9x to $6B it would still have a P/E of 30~. Mediocre margins, unsustainable business model. If $NFLX isn't indicative of euphoria then what is? Absolute insanity. #ValueInvesting #stocks

2447 2018-06-30 03:02:22 like its not the guns that kill people, its the bullets. Duh. I also had another idea, instead of banning bump stocks, just make gyrojet guns standard.

2476 2018-06-30 02:39:37 Except for all the businesses outsourcing because of your tariff policy, thanks for that, stocks took nosedive a hole

2481 2018-06-30 02:33:16 Well yeah. Most people can get a student loan, memorize test banks, and get a degree and live an average life. We have computers and knowledge RIGHT in our hand and we can do so much more. Stocks, smart investing, so many other ways to make money while doing other things in life.
2482 2018-06-30 02:32:51 Wow thanks Jack, after Bitcoin is down nearly 70% from its peak? What visionary insight. Next he’ll tell us he’s not sure that tech stocks were totally fairly priced in 2000.

2489 2018-06-30 02:29:29 $ABWN You can have great co's with bad stocks and bad co's with good performing stocks.  The two don't have to equate. Ultimately if there's something of value here it will be realized, how much is the question.

2507 2018-06-30 02:14:11 Bizarro day in the stocks when my $mnst stock has not only made money for the day, but has finally showing a total gain.  And it’s the only one in my portfolio that’s up today.

2513 2018-06-30 02:06:45 think this is really important, just like we look for best of breed stocks that will outperform the market the same is true in crypto, sadly the majority do not see the value in bch, that’s probably why it’s so strong right now

2535 2018-06-30 01:47:41 When going gets tough, you innovate. The stock market is testing the limits of investor's patience. A systematic approach can help accumulate stocks at lower prices by averaging out costs. Look at the situation as a glass half-filled, to accumulate shares of good businesses

2537 2018-06-30 01:43:44 So, like planes?  Or sports stadiums?  I kind of like those places being gun free.  I do think cops are overworked.  My son being one of them.  I don't think every American should be armed.  I think AR-15s should be banned.  Bump stocks too.  Red Flag laws enacted.
2538 2018-06-30 01:42:50 Amazon not doing shit with Netflix, Hulu or Disney. They in the penny stocks looking for a winner and even then its gonna take 5 years. Netflix been kicking at the door since 10/11 they just got to a business model of dropping heat once a quarter to keep our subscription

2546 2018-06-30 01:35:08 I think one of the clear vested interests here is you. You should be paraded in stocks for people to bombard you with rotten vegetables, you are a traitor to the interests of the United Kingdom.
2547 2018-06-30 01:32:18 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?

2569 2018-06-30 01:19:33 It's great for private prison stocks isn't it? So how much are we charged for each person per day? Think a fraction of that money could have been used as foreign aid or peacekeeping and humanitarian groups in country?

2584 2018-06-30 01:12:12 The Chinese stocks tumble into bear market, with Shanghai index on pace for worst year since 2011.
2585 2018-06-30 01:12:02 Now there's another lie, they received lay offs and store closings, to say nothing of the millions spent on companies buying back stocks and paying their major stockholders dividends. Liar!
2586 2018-06-30 01:08:54 Yeah. Buti nalang din yung merch, super limited lang. Halos preorder lahat. Kaya okay lang if di pumila para bumili kasi konte lanb choices tapos konte lang din stocks
2587 2018-06-30 01:07:46 herrera would look better in stocks & pillory...
2588 2018-06-30 01:07:41 Why not just do stocks
2589 2018-06-30 01:06:58 High capacity magazines don’t make a difference. Either have 1 high cap mag or 10 low cap. You haven’t solved your issue. Bump stocks are fine in my opinion. It’s illegal to sell to a someone whose been in a mental institution and they can’t buy one.

2591 2018-06-30 01:04:54 The cause of the Great Depression is eerily the same as the last Great Recession. That happened because of buying stocks on the margin. People investing with borrowed money. A crisis in the making. Margins were called the economy collapse. It was worldwide
2592 2018-06-30 01:04:34 Do they have full auto assault backwards funnels with bump stocks?
2593 2018-06-30 01:03:29 Which is why buying individual mines is most likely a better idea than ETF trading vehicles. Probably true of all ETF's as well.  #investors #traders #stockmarket #stocks #ETFs
2594 2018-06-30 01:02:34 The challenge isn't learning how to correctly time the market or stocks... that's the easy part. The challenge is learning how to get your emotions and idiosyncrasies out of the way of your potential.
2595 2018-06-30 01:00:56 Today I heard Trump say 6 million Americans received a raise or bonus because of his tax cuts. 

That's amazing! 

Except that is only 4% of the workforce..

2609 2018-06-30 00:51:55 I do, but I bet he doesn't. And how many companies took the money to fund restructuring (layoff) costs or to buy back stocks?
2610 2018-06-30 00:51:49 I sold off all my stocks today. Trump is going to crash the economy before the end of the year.

2612 2018-06-30 00:50:43 did you know - nearly every company that issued bonuses, laid of workers?  that most of the tax cuts are going to buying back stocks, that when the money left from gift tax on bonuses was used up, ppl still have the same pay while prices of everything is rising?
2613 2018-06-30 00:50:00 MW UPDATE: Investors pull $30 billion out of stocks in 2nd-largest weekly outflow on record: BAML
2614 2018-06-30 00:48:41 If you watched their stocks, you'd know that something was up. They're the only stock with over $1,200 per share right now and it hasn't changed in a while. Not even Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, etc has that much per share. Someones throwin money at them like crazy!
2615 2018-06-30 00:47:28 What happened to the common sense gun legislation he promised to pass after Parkland? Background checks, bump stocks, raising minimum age etc. Said he wasn't even going to wait for Congress. These measures likely wouldnt have prevented this event but only a matter of time til nxt

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
私たちの株式投資への意欲をそぐような要因がかなりある。
2625 2018-06-30 00:41:43 Yep. It's getting into @farmerrf territory. Targeting the total return index on a composite of real (as opposed to nominal, stocks rather than bonds) assets.
2626 2018-06-30 00:40:31 Slow start this week with the stocks, but finished strong with profits. Having one of those work hard, play harder mentality this weekend!
2627 2018-06-30 00:40:19 Gov say no GST but retailer still selling at same prices everywhere. They cut off GST but increase their price claiming that the old stocks that they bought have GST. So, they have to increase to cut lost.....Is this right?
2628 2018-06-30 00:39:58 As you say, circumstances might change and we could see greater price divergence and weaker correlations, but right now DJIA and bitcoin are correlated. Interestingly, bitcoin/spot gold is not. If you want a non-correlated hedge, gold holds more promise than stocks.

2640 2018-06-30 00:33:05 And corporations have spent hundreds of millions buying back their own stocks.... So much for really funneling all that cash back to competitive wages....
2641 2018-06-30 00:32:32 I grew up by a Trago Mills store in Cornwall and the owner put stocks and shackles outside for shop lifters. Really. But someone knicked them. Classic. Made me even more proud of my Kernow roots.
2642 2018-06-30 00:32:29 The amount of the bonuses and benefits is minuscule percentage of the actual corporate tax savings - most of the money has gone to stock buy backs not to mention price appreciation of all of the stocks - “1 for you 19 for me” like the old Beatles tune except in reverse

2659 2018-06-30 00:11:48 lol what?! 
1.) Markets are not efficient, EMH is a theoretical concept only.
2.) Dividends are not discounted as soon as information is conveyed. Stocks decline with their dividend amount on the ex-dividend date.
3.) HOW IS THIS NOT BASIC KNOWLEDGE AMONGST TRADERS?!?! 
2660 2018-06-30 00:08:48 Markets had a decent day today until at the very end, wham, down they went. Who is sponsoring this attack on investors/IRAs continuously over nearly the last year and why?  Theories? Financials and stock valuation unhinged/hundreds of stocks devalued by wall street unfairly

2715 2018-06-29 23:36:12 Some more info about us: we do everything profitable, from supreme to shoes like yeezys, the off white collection to stocks and crypto, funko, and HQ. We are preparing for tomorrow’s drops, the Yeezy Butters and Jordan 4 Levi’s. We plan to have great success for those.
2716 2018-06-29 23:35:51 You'd be surprised how much "competent" advisors not so competent in some of these organizations. 

Which is why I mentioned pricing. Most persons will buy in because their advisor didn't help them with that part of it. 
But some stocks actually makes no sense to be bought.
2717 2018-06-29 23:35:32 Yes husband thank you for the Friday night date at #firebirds there's nothing more romantic then listening to you talk about your #tysonchicken stocks
2718 2018-06-29 23:35:00 Yeah I don't really have any opinion on that or any other stocks I don't hold , all I'm saying is , when one gets called out , all should ! Theres plenty of poster on twitter and HC that are directly involved with the companies they promote  Why call out only one ?
2719 2018-06-29 23:34:51 That's what the "talking heads" would like us to believe, Stocks that have risen too fast and too high are coming back to reality.  Stocks that have been ignored are getting some traction.
2720 2018-06-29 23:34:42 He probably means pre market. So Monday morning before market opens, ofcourse $SPY and other stocks change prices. For instance wake up Monday morning around 6 am and see. Also another indicator is $ES_F check the price Sunday evening for a good indicator of where the market is
2721 2018-06-29 23:33:11 Most of the money was used to buy back stocks, which was predicted. This is why the tax bill has a 34% approval rating.
2722 2018-06-29 23:32:49 I don't trade these stocks or commodities. Make my head spin!  Have a great weekend.

2724 2018-06-29 23:31:36 Notes — Rick Laubach will be driving Steve Young’s No. 187 modified; The street stocks include 2 regulars at Trail-Way, Kyle Martin and Ryan Smith.
2725 2018-06-29 23:31:31 Hourly rates went down. Companies are using the rich tax cuts to buy back stocks.
2726 2018-06-29 23:30:57 There we go. I don't teach expert investing. I don't show the path to becoming an analyst. I just teach regular, unqualified, possibly uneducated (like me) people how to understand enough to get started, how to make money from stocks and how speak sensibly to a competent advisor.
2727 2018-06-29 23:30:36 Trump & the GOP Stole 4 TRILLION$ in wealth from hardworking Americans to give tax cuts to the richest citizens & overseas corps, adding  2..5TRILLION$ in debt. They invested in stocks. NO WAGE INCREASES. We got layoffs. Some got a one time PR bonus
2728 2018-06-29 23:29:55 Wow I feel like such an adult now that we started investing in stocks  we be like, oh we made .75 cents today!!! 
2729 2018-06-29 23:29:29 they clearly have stakes in short stocks

I'm not going to go into pricing and evaluation mechanics in an article like that. Valuation alone is such a touchy area, even for experts, wouldn't make sense to bring it to newbies

2749 2018-06-29 23:15:40 I think this tweet should read, "CATASTROPHIC NEWS!!!!!!  CHARLY CARUSO LEAVING WWE??? STOCKS TO PLUMMET??????  FOX BACKING OUT OF TV DEAL????????"

And then you can start the article by saying, "no, no she isn't"
2750 2018-06-29 23:12:22 I'll post some charts later. I'm holding $XHB for LT play. $XLE/$XES/$OIH/$FCG are harder. Big question is why are they lagging oil & do they play catch up? No idea. Some stocks like $DVN, $HES, $APA, $APC look promising, but still lagging. $WLL, $ECA, $WTI weaker than I'd like.

All within your power. You said that you were not afraid of the NRA. #Resist
2758 2018-06-29 23:06:17 This job market and consumer confidence and stocks says otherwise. I don’t feel envious of the version of reality that you live. Join the rest of us in America
2759 2018-06-29 23:05:01 Sadly it's not true, remember bump stocks Trump said probably four times he was going to make sure they were made it illegal
2760 2018-06-29 23:04:30 Hi I don’t even dislike my body that much. Until I want to buy clothes. Then it turns out NOWHERE STOCKS THE CUTE STUFF ABOVE A 10/12 AND IT MAKES ME HATE MYSELF NICE ONE
2761 2018-06-29 23:03:02 Except families aren’t thriving if nobody is getting wage increases. Companies have been buying back stocks at a record rate. $200 billion.
2762 2018-06-29 23:02:35 @woody115 @stockwizzaard I have an excel spreadsheet that classifies and categorizes undervalued stocks.
2763 2018-06-29 23:00:59 It only costs $8 to buy stocks on the stock market, therefore the economy is accessible to everyone.
2764 2018-06-29 23:00:54 Yeah better invest in metal clothes hanger stocks before prices skyrocket. SMFH
2765 2018-06-29 22:59:42 Can’t share anything political on FB because all these middle aged guys that I’m friends with get all triggered because they’re stocks are doing fine while they pretend the rest of the country isn’t all messed.
2766 2018-06-29 22:58:43 Does anybody know if Bump Stocks have been banned?

I heard the wannabe dictator say he was going to do it, but then I never heard anything else. I'm not looking for likes or retweets, I'm just looking for a factual answer please! Only fellow resistors need reply!
2767 2018-06-29 22:58:26 no johns but i really wish i had any form of semi consistent shiek practice :/ i couldn’t close out any stocks and he got hella combos i wasn’t ready for
2768 2018-06-29 22:56:59 Yes and the wages are not keeping up with inflation. But yet  companies are buying back stocks at record pace.
2769 2018-06-29 22:56:52 It's not looking good, money is flowing out of stocks in the US. 
Possible US crash coming. Trump is 15-20 years to late, the rest of the world can survive without the USA now ( Asia after the gfc really worked to protect against exactly what he's trying to do ).
2770 2018-06-29 22:56:41 Dumb asses it’s a ONE time thing Corporation keep them indefinitely.  Not to mention the companies are buying back stocks. Trump could sell some people fire  in Hell & they’d buy it.
2771 2018-06-29 22:56:31 Often commercial broths/stocks won’t actually say “onion” but say something vague like “natural seasonings” - that basically means there’s onion in it but not specifically listed.
2772 2018-06-29 22:55:32 all these hackers and devs but no one can shut down stocks for a day
2773 2018-06-29 22:55:12 Prime = $99/yr / 52 = $1.90/wk / 40 = You got a 5 cent an hour raise! 

I'm sure the CEO of your company who got an additional million in stocks is just as thankful of this administration as you are. 

PS: how are gas prices in your area?
2774 2018-06-29 22:54:46 Don’t forget to mention all the corporations that used their tax benefit to buy back stocks and not pass this onto their employees and did not give raises or bonuses!
2775 2018-06-29 22:53:55 And how many corps either bought stocks back or moved facilities overseas with the money?
2776 2018-06-29 22:53:11 It’s the cheapest ore to buy as an Ironman, and he only stocks 10 at a time. There’s atleast 3 Bot world buying out the stock, all there names are gibberish. Maybe make it a requirement to finish freminik isles to buy from the shops there?

2789 2018-06-29 22:32:02 reading that Amazon bought a relatively unknown online prescription biz called PillPack, and Walgreens, CVS and Right Aid have all seen their stocks drop. I'm just hoping Amazon doesn't decide to disrupt youth ministry coaching.

2794 2018-06-29 22:25:26 $AVZ Is a bit of an enigma. It's one of the few stocks that should still be micro and was pushing well into mid cap at $700m mc on a single drill hole. Geopolitical risk aside. That's ridiculous and absolutely accurate when I was blocked by ML for saying that at 650m mc.
2795 2018-06-29 22:24:02 You think I’m fucking unacceptable? Let me tell u what’s unacceptable an impairable increase in trumps stocks, a deductible decrease in child labor and amateur pregnancy. Unstable patients at psychiatric facilities. And minors in boot camps! That’s what’s up acceptable
2796 2018-06-29 22:23:49 We made it! Up in the tower, and ready to go. Street stocks are on the track for their time trials. Don't forget, tonight is kids night! There is a whole slew of bikes under the tower that need a new home tonight. Will it be you?

SAD
2799 2018-06-29 22:21:57 I am long and scratching my head . This stock needs to perform soon cause investor sentiment isn’t as strong as it should be. We are going into a challenging summer for stocks without consistent momentum .
2800 2018-06-29 22:21:27 Stocks is on my watch but not my phone. This seems like an egregious miss.
2801 2018-06-29 22:20:45 80% of the USA knows this is a lie! 80% of the USA knows that corp's threw  a 1X bonus at workers and only 1 corp - Walmart announce a wage increase the rest bought back their own stocks! They still will only hire prt tm to avoid paying benefits & won't pay a living wage!
2802 2018-06-29 22:19:20 Bit too much Sam ;-))) love confidence though . I have in my website spoken about 6 stocks partially to spread risk . Rank them in terms of relative strength ( something am preparing this weekend in an article ) and you are better placed in my view . I am long Enq too though
2803 2018-06-29 22:18:42 Are these new stocks po? 
2804 2018-06-29 22:18:34 One more awful than the next, I’m sure!
2805 2018-06-29 22:18:23 True but this is the same company that is getting a billion dollars and their stocks have been high with mediocre television which is dismal. I guess we’ll see where the money lies in the end.

I know dividend stocks can be good, but would like your opinion! Thank you
2838 2018-06-29 22:01:20 Got well and truly splatter today at my school after. The kids loved throwing wet sponges at me in the 'stocks'. Cooled me right down in this weather though. #loveteaching
2839 2018-06-29 21:57:40 Maybe Kamala, former AG of CA, will have us pass laws against dunking and public stocks? Maybe an anti-Iron Maiden law, too?
2840 2018-06-29 21:56:57 Sure they don’t. Let’s ask don’s attorney, Michael Cohen, how many abortions #DavidDennison and his rich buddies paid for. Trump and Woods are both laughing stocks to decent people, btw.

2844 2018-06-29 21:55:14 Shocker.  But I sure do miss talking to everyone that had awesome bitcoin success stories.  That was amazing at the holiday parties.  Almost as fun as .com stocks in the 90’s.

2847 2018-06-29 21:54:31 Someth 2 consider when looking for a stock broker: yesterday I noticed discrepancies on my @RobinhoodApp accnt (balance below value of stocks I own and $ disappeared). @AskRobinhood took forever to contact me today saying will get back to me on Monday. Really?! #whereismymoney
2848 2018-06-29 21:53:36 Just curious how many of those investors do you think might just be employed by these company's threw direct stocks or threw 401 plains.And how many millions of other people have stocks and bonds who will all benefit when these company's do good.?
2849 2018-06-29 21:53:17 @optionsaction GREAT MINDS ON THIS SHOW! I am trying to figure out the basic material sector, mainly the Lithium and Cobalt miner companies. Are tariffs going to keep these stocks down for a long time? Like more than a year? #long #battery
2850 2018-06-29 21:52:27 Most of the riches are in investments, real property, stocks, bonds, etc.
2851 2018-06-29 21:52:24 Cant even see the stocks lmao
2852 2018-06-29 21:51:55 I usually never tweet about stocks on here, but if you’re holding $NVCN please... STOP PANIC SELLING.
2853 2018-06-29 21:49:37 Ah you were missed @FrjsJun fair today. We had your mates in the stocks too. 
2854 2018-06-29 21:49:12 I'm rw af and this is idiotic. Fill the jails with petty criminals? Waste of resources. Now, if you want to talk about corporal punishment for serial petty criminals... Or the stocks? Or public humiliation? We can negotiate.

2857 2018-06-29 21:46:05 Both, options mid term and stock long term. I have 3 accounts with different amount of $$ and for different purposes. I.e SUPN I own stocks long and also been killing the options. CORT, NKE, MU (pig) long stocks and options for 7/20.
2858 2018-06-29 21:45:59 Get ready for US troop removal from Germany and withdrawal from WTO and NATO. Coming soon. And @GOP will do nothing except clutch their corporate stocks closely to their chests and monitor the safety of their offshore investments. IMHO.

2861 2018-06-29 21:43:42 Too much debt out there. Commercial and consumer. Rising rates will increase default rates. I’m not buying any bank stocks.
2862 2018-06-29 21:41:51 $HMNY up over 30% today; follow idiots and lose 30% of your money shorting.. ..who short penny stocks?
2863 2018-06-29 21:41:50 I usually buy stocks long term or if the IV and price is crazy high and doesn't justify the price of the options i.e. HMNY today with IV of 300% on the calls/puts (ridiculous) so I bought shares instead to Daytrade.
2864 2018-06-29 21:40:44 The Treasury Yield Curve Declined Friday to It's Lowest Level. Again, signaling a Recession on the Horizon. If you have stocks now is a good time to sell.
2865 2018-06-29 21:40:07 Yeah he's just been egregiously bad for stocks lol.
2866 2018-06-29 21:40:02 yes, but and it is a Big but: centralisation means I have to go well out of my way and make a special trip; before when stocks were good, it came to me (my neighbourhood), so easy. Not going to happen with centralised, 'efficiency driven' neoliberal system

2870 2018-06-29 21:39:13 I like to buy vertical/diagonal put spreads on stocks I’d like to own anyway. Usually sell 7 to 14 days buy 60 to 90 days. Selling weekly premium in this environment. Have I been lucky, or is that a decent strategy?
2871 2018-06-29 21:38:48 The rest of us have received NOTHING but lower hours, higher insurance premiums, and in some cases, reductions in pay.

The Tax Cuts are a sham designed to reward the wealthy & give corporations the funds to buy back stocks. It does little for the majority of workers.
2872 2018-06-29 21:38:21 My Stocks keeps going up that is all I care about, 43% in the last 18 months!!!!
2873 2018-06-29 21:38:17 People just keep looking at the scoreboard (price), being stocks, oil, rates, fx, crypto. If you want to win, you gotta see how the game is being played, you gotta know the players, the drivers, the moving parts, mkt psychology. Make a case! Thats how you win!

2877 2018-06-29 21:34:36 @ChartsGuy Wording a bit off. Meaning what many consider to be great stocks to buy, when the easy trade has already been made. ex $BILI etc
2878 2018-06-29 21:34:19 Propaganda lies. The tax cuts have nothing to do with what is going on. They are only good for the 1% who are buying back their own stocks. Quit with the lies!
2879 2018-06-29 21:33:45 How come the bank stocks faded into pure dog shit once again???!  Mind blowing.
2880 2018-06-29 21:33:30 yet you promised to outlaw bump stocks and raise the age to 21 but did nothing..you are owned by the NRA and care nothing about the citizens of the USA. you called the press the enemy of the country so this is on you as your words went a long way to this outlandish incident
2881 2018-06-29 21:32:28 Newborn clothes; colored  stocks are ready to ship. Thank you

2889 2018-06-29 21:24:05 Sir, we did not pass the law banning bump stocks. If you have concerns about this law or any others in Denver, we encourage you reach out to your council person.

2892 2018-06-29 21:22:08 Don’t worry guys, you banned bump stocks and that’s clearly helped with shootings so I’m sure all the criminals in Denver will listen to this warning and obey it. 
2893 2018-06-29 21:22:07 I don't think that's real if that super requires 4 stocks
2894 2018-06-29 21:21:54 How’s that work?  Kind of like stocks in a company?
2895 2018-06-29 21:21:20 $ASCMA Posted my analysis a few hours ago... and now it’s up 6% AH. Could be massive next week. Don’t chase, as I posted recommended entries #pennystocks #daytrading #stocks #stockmarkets #stockmarket

2905 2018-06-29 21:13:53 @CommonManRadio @MattyIce971 The money is a young man’s wish. Plenty of thoughts about the future and the means to enjoy it. I definitely would want to know the secrets. You could know what stocks are doing well. At least I’d know where I put my damn sunglasses last week!
2906 2018-06-29 21:12:08 Planning to buy the program. But are you actually in the chat room? Do you really help us to understand trading? Or is it a list of stocks to follow during the day like the other guy.??
2907 2018-06-29 21:11:50 Yea the entire industry took that crisis alpha tag line and spewed it to anyone who was afraid of stocks falling. Then everyone got confused and thought TF was some sure fire bet that made money whenever stocks fell. Wrong!

2915 2018-06-29 21:05:57 Yeah, sure. Minimal cuts for the masses...massive for corporations that are reinvesting or buying back their own stocks. You truly think that Americans are as ignorant as you? Damn space cadet.
2916 2018-06-29 21:05:26 $PED sad I didn't go with my gut and buy at 2.30 but glad I knew not to short.. I don't like shorting stocks below $3... not a lot of downside potential in relation to upside potential..

2940 2018-06-29 20:55:20 Especially given that we do all the work,they just sit on their ass trading stocks back and forth across the top. If everyone just sat out for one day we'd see a big change in the way they do shit, but that's the point of why they do what they do so we don't take our power back.

2947 2018-06-29 20:50:07 @Acosta but until you and others like you decide to be objective, unbiased, reporting facts as they come, not as you want them to be, we have no reason to trust the media. In fact, the media was called out in the 80's. Dirty Laundry by Don Henley. Take a listen.

2951 2018-06-29 20:48:50 @Acosta ...Care to take a guess as to what the answer was? It was "sure..why not!'. An ethical reporter would have said "no", walked out and told his boss how a sitting president tried to use the media as a democrat communication arm. You can shout all you want, Jim..(cont)
2952 2018-06-29 20:48:45 Lethal & o iTz Goofy are the biggest laughing stocks the community has ever seen 
2953 2018-06-29 20:46:48 @Acosta To continue: When Obama waged war against Fox News, did you stand up and call him out? No. You silently approved. When Obama summoned the media to the WH to give them ACA talking points so they can frame the argument for him, the ethical response was "no..".
2954 2018-06-29 20:45:38 @Acosta Hey Jim. The media (you) is supposed to be objective and ethical. When you wear your political affiliation on your sleeve and engage in 24/7 harassment of a president you don't like, but glorified the one you did, you violated the very essence of journalism.
2955 2018-06-29 20:45:35 At least you put them back and not rape the stocks

But... everything that goes up, must come down, incomes taxes, loans, mortgage loans, financial stocks, your retirement, pension will take a hit tax form 1099 and others will ensue, would be nice, if we didn't have to pay it #lowincome 
2964 2018-06-29 20:42:13 Not necessarily. Capelin is a key species that eat species tightly coupled to the sea ice edge. The total consequences for commercial fish stocks of an entirely sea ice free, non-stratified northern Barents Sea is uncertain.
2965 2018-06-29 20:41:31 Yeah, well said. The secular trends that were/are good for Gold are still in place. The same goes for the secular trends that were bad for stocks and caused 2 massive bear markets (over indebtedness, rampant speculation, demographics, etc.). Imho the market topped in January.
2966 2018-06-29 20:41:11 Those 300 billions were used to buy back stocks by large corporations! Doesn't help the average guy in the street.
2967 2018-06-29 20:41:09 That’s correct and then we had the largest buy back of corporate stocks. This money went to the already wealthy and did not help regular Americans. You remember those people right, the ones you claim to represent.

2969 2018-06-29 20:40:13 A lot of tech stocks staking out nice early gains only to cough them up as the day wore on.  Suggest waiting for a confirmation of the start of a new uptrend before putting much $$$ at risk.  (May be soon but jury's still out).

2978 2018-06-29 20:36:47 Actually those bonuses were a one time thing. Wages haven't gone up, companies used 99.995% to buy back stocks and give CEOs a raise. There are 125.97 million full time workers in US, that means only 4.7% benefited from your tax cuts.

2982 2018-06-29 20:34:49 I don't know from stocks or bonds but prices of beautiful used instruments on Reverb are falling, and in my world that means recession
2983 2018-06-29 20:34:36 Fact: Wages aren’t rising. Companies are using profits to do shareholder buy backs and to pay their stockholders. Fact: The majority of Americans don’t have investments in stocks and aren’t benefiting. Fact: Your stupid tax cut plan is exploding the deficit! #UnfitToBePresident

2999 2018-06-29 20:28:15 Wages are stagnant. Those execs you gave taxcuts to bought shares of their own stocks. It didn't trickle down like you guys said it would. But you knew this was going to happen anyway.

3004 2018-06-29 20:26:03 Stocks may have crashed without all of the buybacks. Certainly didnt trickle down 
3005 2018-06-29 20:25:59 2/2 We can only try to cope & fight to improve our emotional health. Oh, & fight to reduce the poss. of it happening to others. We need your help though.

3006 2018-06-29 20:25:56 $SPY How soon we forget. Careful getting caught up, making a rash decision based on short term, 5 minute charts only to see stocks go higher
3007 2018-06-29 20:25:46 Love how you guys keep making up stuff. Stocks are great because the majority of the tax relief to corps went to stock buybacks, not jobs or investments. Ask Carrier, Harley Davidson, and others. You inherited a roaring economy and started a trade war. Hoo rah.

3009 2018-06-29 20:23:06 Stocks have been rising since Obama allowed the Fed to monetize the debt in 2009. And for 8 years, the Right didn't believe the jobs reports. Now they do. Jesus would not take kindly to calling a human "illegal". And, as always, patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel.

3012 2018-06-29 20:21:47 stocks and real estate. Get a lot of good info on stuff being in government. Get that weight up.
3013 2018-06-29 20:21:43 The stock market does nothing to tell anyone how I am doing. I am not the one that owns the stocks. That is DJT and his cronies. They are doing well most of us are not.
3014 2018-06-29 20:21:39 The fact is that the #DJIA, #SP500 and #FTSE100 all ended the first half as FLAT as a pancake. Given the considerable and non-recurring stimulus that helped keep them at this level, one has to wonder what the second half will bring? #stocks

3029 2018-06-29 20:13:51 Me too but my portfolio has gotten seriously whacked the last two weeks. Hoping most of it is end of the quarter/half repositioning. Bank stocks faded today after being up big again, Been on a serious losing streak that is never-ending. Lots a winning going on right now :)

3032 2018-06-29 20:12:32 Incorrect. When the Fed acts as expected, there is no effect on stocks. Bond yield and consumer interest rates go up but inflation is the real enemy.
3033 2018-06-29 20:12:16 Actually after the tax cut. There was 190 billion dollars exchanged in buy back stocks. Wages have only gone up 2.7% since May 2017. Bonuses  given to employees was a one time deal with restrictions. So..70% of the tax scam actually went to stock buy backs
3034 2018-06-29 20:12:15 Not sure if factories do,  but if you held stocks of Co2 instead of relying on single supply chains would this not stop theses shortages, especially  if they come from EU
3035 2018-06-29 20:11:28 World stocks higher: Europe +.8%; US +.1%. For today, investors decided to believe Trump would back-off enough to avoid all out trade war. Could be but not sure thing & much volatility before we know. Gamblers may want to make new bet either way; investors should stay the course.

3059 2018-06-29 19:56:54 In the early 2000's I invested $100 in Netflix. That investment would be worth over $25k today if I hadn't sold those stocks for a very tiny gain later that year. Anybody have a time machine I could borrow?
3060 2018-06-29 19:56:32 YaY!! Because that's EXACTLY what the tax cuts were for, one time bonuses, trivial raises, and 401K contributions. Ohhh, wait, they were for JOB GROWTH! Remember jobs jobs jobs? How about the billions that went back into the company to buyback stocks or line their own pockets?
3061 2018-06-29 19:56:22 My issue is with CNN purposely listing it for the past 6 months rather than the last year. All investments should be graded on their annual return unless maturity is semi-annual and so forth. If in 6 more months stocks are still flat THEN roast him. This is sensationalism.

3064 2018-06-29 19:53:08 Does anyone ever wonder if he's purposely doing this to drive stocks down so he and rich buddies can buy low and sell high? Or is that too stupid an idea? Can't work if they are driven out of business--like playing chicken.
3065 2018-06-29 19:53:02 Sure we are...Lets see how fast they all come running back and how many use the new found cash to buy back company stocks ? Only in his dreams will the American working class be great again ..

If he fails, the darn stocks are already in the toilet. So VERY low risk relatively speaking.

3071 2018-06-29 19:50:42 Ain larger numbers then took the bonus to buy back stocks to their own companies which benefit the share holders alone. So much for helping middleclass. The Poor are forgotten with defrunded health programs.
3072 2018-06-29 19:50:09 That’s because you know nothing about stocks. The averages on 1/2/2018

3080 2018-06-29 19:47:35 You don't need to read a thousand pages to figure out that moving plants to wherever they can get the cheapest labour maximises profit which is not shared with the workers. Productivity goes up. Stocks go up. Executives make bank.

3083 2018-06-29 19:45:36 @davidhogg111 you got it RIGHT on bump stocks. But you have to study the history of the world before you decide gun ownership is bad in the homes of free men and women. It is only then you will see that we MUST keep our 2nd A pure & untainted. A Boca Mom.

3090 2018-06-29 19:42:10 You have no idea what you're talking about. Almost all of the tax cuts went straight into stock buybacks which just raised the price of stocks (which have since fallen).

3120 2018-06-29 19:25:09 I'll try to translate this for myself.  The market maker MAXM keeps going.  The increase to 5 Trillion looked bad but it may effect the reverse split?
3121 2018-06-29 19:24:55 Of those 6 million (# can't be proven) what % actually got a raise & for how much? As compared to what % got a one time bonus & for how much? What we DO know is how many corporations used the money to buy back stocks & give dividends to investors instead of to employees.
3122 2018-06-29 19:24:22 Lies!! The rich corporations you gave the tax cuts to are reinvesting those cuts into their own stocks and making profits for themselves!! It's lies!!!!
3123 2018-06-29 19:24:14 @foimbert would you stop posting fake news? “stocks to end first half with a bang”? Maybe “stocks to end 2pm with a bang”. Why don’t you wait until stocks are closed?

3148 2018-06-29 19:06:01 Most of the money went to dividends and especially buy back of stocks. Beware buying back a company’s stock artificially raises EPS results but lasts about a year then companies will have much tougher time beating prior year results.

1) Stocks can go down (in theory )
2) One can't easily access the $ for living expenses.
3) Upper mgmt gets the biggest payoff.
Quite the scam.
3210 2018-06-29 18:34:02 I think banks stocks are manipulated today ... just for the OE - horrible, wallstreet criminals can't make money without manipulation!

3212 2018-06-29 18:33:32 What about the companies that used the tax cuts to buyback their own stocks, artificially inflating their worth?

 Its easy to pick stocks.. but very difficult to follow the above..
Do trade to avoid focus on booking profit/ loss on investments..If ur pocket is empty u tend to use ur savings...making sure my pocket is nt empty
3236 2018-06-29 18:22:51 Pretty sure "dominant currency demand" wasn't bigger than reserve demand a few years back.   Can accomodate transactional demand/ balances w-o holding huge stocks of long-term USD bonds.  Still need to be convinced on size of "transactional" demand v US funding need

3307 2018-06-29 17:52:25 If you want long-term, make sure you have dividend-paying stocks of stable companies.  The share price can bounce about, but you can sell calls against them from time-to-time, PLUS the dividend...
They give nice returns over time.

3322 2018-06-29 17:47:22 I hear there's a big boom in private for profit prison stocks. The rest of the stock market shows a LOSS for the YEAR!
3323 2018-06-29 17:47:12 I’m confused. My understanding with stocks is that a high price-earnings ratio reflects an expectation that *earnings* will grow in future (ie. Tesla will make huge profits someday), not that the price will. So with real estate, that would mean expecting rents to rise, no?

3337 2018-06-29 17:42:53 Then do YOUR job, sir!  Are bump stocks illegal yet? No! ANY new gun control measures? No!  Will the person that sold the shotgun to the Capital killer be prosecuted? Probably not. Do more than talk, sir, we are tired of just words
3338 2018-06-29 17:42:35 He would have had access to a bunch of arms regardless with his and his brother's ties to the DNC's racket, they had past transactions. The only thing that would happen is people who like to use bump stocks for recreational use would be forced to bump fire another way.
3339 2018-06-29 17:41:14 President Trump’s tax cuts have made it possible for massive corporations like Walmart to give minimal bonuses to workers while allowing the company to buy back billions in stocks, increasing investors $, while closing hundreds of stores and ending thousands of jobs. Awesome!

3346 2018-06-29 17:37:44 I don't think so. The same gun-banners like Leland Yee, Holder that wanted to ban these stocks was also buying and selling automatic weapons and shoulder fired missiles. They had a racket that involved several Democrats high up in the state/fed and they knew the Paddock brothers.

3460 2018-06-29 16:45:14 Real talk about Smash Ultimate:

3 stocks should be our baseline for ruleset testing. If it's "too long" after 3 months we can go back to 2. But from what I can tell, the game is just faster and less forgiving than Smash 4 so 3 stocks is a good baseline for testing.

3464 2018-06-29 16:43:14 Well I think if people go through background checks before purchasing guns and military style guns and bump stocks are unavailable, we will see less murders
3465 2018-06-29 16:42:45 I myself think that bump stocks are an obvious abuse of a legal loophole and should be banned. Aside from emulating fully automatic fire with little skill on the part of the user, they're just bad for the guns.
And yet actually beneficial things (suppressors, braces) get banned.
3466 2018-06-29 16:42:34 Yeah got it to the shop got a buddy bringing my stocks to change out after work thanks man
3467 2018-06-29 16:42:18 Yeah, I know. But most people put it in stocks and bonds, right? I don't remember being offered the Malaysian rubber plant fund.
3468 2018-06-29 16:42:09 What kinds of gun legislation will you support in Congress to stop #gunviolence ?  We want a ban on all weapons used in war and a ban on bump stocks. We want gun buy- back programs, a strong red flag law, along with background checks.

You need a more secure financial future and you know it. Start acting like it.

3711 2018-06-29 15:07:53 That's becoz of the extra margin I guess..anyway people are losing the way stocks fall and operators dump even quality midcaps
3712 2018-06-29 15:07:43 In a perfect world, the market(s) would show no reaction to today's numbers.

3831 2018-06-29 14:19:45 You will NEVER be able to favorably spin your permanent corporate handouts in a positive way. They are buying back stocks, lining their pockets, closing their doors and firing employees. Meanwhile the temporary middle class cuts aren’t even allowing people a living wage.

3839 2018-06-29 14:18:18 Maybe the reason that Wayne LaPierre kept lying to the NRA members, and to America, about President Obama coming for the guns is because he knew that someone needs to come for the guns.

3841 2018-06-29 14:18:03 Asking as a passive investor and generally an idiot on matters like this, are the fallen hedge fund managers who refer to the FAANG stocks as a "bubble basket" wrong? Or just wrong about scale and timing? To me, FAANG stocks look like very successful $100 bill stores.

3872 2018-06-29 14:08:36 Not sure I'd compare vfm based on fees vs. income. Surely is value added, service delivered and net returns that matter?

IE. Income vfm measure irrelevant if fund drops 40% due to self investing pensioner getting it wrong and they then cash in and pay a whacking tax bill on top.

3890 2018-06-29 14:02:25 Initially, might be correct on price reduction. As they gain market share, likely would go back up, though. & as other pharmacy chains get hit, they’ll likely have to raise margins (prices) to stay profitable.

3952 2018-06-29 13:38:31 It's okay, I'll look for a kstore here in ph that will have them in stocks next month.
3953 2018-06-29 13:38:08 You mean the stories reporting when Trump gaslights the country about his record, violates ethical norms, dismantles consumer and environmental protections, stocks his cabinet with pampered billionaires abusing the taxpayers’ money, and trashes the investigation into his treason?
3954 2018-06-29 13:37:05 Added to my #I3E & #BMN positions at 98p & 17.375p respectively this week. Well executed trades looking toward close today I’d say. Both stocks are driven by solid fundamentals, no BS.

3958 2018-06-29 13:36:22 BC IT IS COMING, if not has already started (stock market has gone nowhere but down in 2018). Wages stagnant b/c corp tax cuts are being used to buy back stocks. Companies are shipping jobs & factories overseas. Healthcare costs about to skyrocket.

Pay attention.

3960 2018-06-29 13:36:16 $VXX back under 200dSMA - this all has the makings of a big market rally and vixtermination for a lot of the day once things settle this AM. If we get a solid day of upward movement in stocks, next week could be really nice.

3962 2018-06-29 13:35:58 Stocks open higher as the month, quarter and first half of 2018 comes to an end.
3963 2018-06-29 13:35:43 I track only 5-6 stocks on a daily basis... If there is a clear trend in them then I take trade, else avoid... Reliance.. Hdfc bank... Titan... Hul... United spirits.. UBL.. JUBILANT FOOD...

3965 2018-06-29 13:34:01 I love when stock promoters put stocks they clearly own a long position in on twitter and tweet "#watchlist"... Sure, you have been tweeting about this stock for 7 months, but its just on your watchlist now. Great job, no one sees through that.

3976 2018-06-29 13:30:09 I remember reading that the whole "fruit & veg" thing was a Victorian sanitisation of what really happened.

People in the stocks were often killed, tortured or raped. Usually under the cover of darkness, so no-one knew who did it, allowed for punishment-free revenge.

3982 2018-06-29 13:27:53 There has been an endless negative mentality on this 9+ year bull market. Keep it coming, I suspect there will be a moment in near future (1yr or so) that tide will swing to a more positve near euphoric outlook on stocks. It will never seem so until it happens

3986 2018-06-29 13:25:33 Both great stocks. Do you go for #I3E or #UPL. Personally I'm would be swayed towards #I3E despite a higher SP if I invested in oil.
3987 2018-06-29 13:25:03 Could you imagine the Donald giving up his business , salary, stocks etc. To cut taxes, create lowest black/ Hispanic unemployment. Create world peace defeat Isis, etc.etc. for profit! Lol that would be crazy .
3988 2018-06-29 13:24:57 And Walgreens just got added to the Dow. It'd be hilarious if Walgreen's dragging down the Dow makes Joe Average sell some of his stocks!

3992 2018-06-29 13:23:12 Awesome! make it happen bro, like stocks always take profits when they are there! Always appreciate and enjoy the moments both good and bad because they helped make you who you are, but never forget they don’t determine what you will be

4054 2018-06-29 12:54:44 Surprised by #nifty #smallcap #midcap rally. I bought both #allsec and #koltepatil 1000+ yesterday .. both hit 20% upper circuit today but earlier purchases were routed by over -25% . Difficult  to understand how these stocks work.
4055 2018-06-29 12:53:12 10-Yr UST rates are hovering near 2.85%. It touched 2.82% intra-day yesterday and bounced off. Technicals still support lower yields in the near future. Geopolitical risks (read tariffs) and recession fears affecting stocks could influence a flight to quality bid in Treasuries.
4056 2018-06-29 12:52:40 I save my arguing & rile ups mostly for World Cup & that’s every 4 years. So please don’t make attempts to deplete my stocks by looking to start something non WC related. You will be sorely disappointed.

4074 2018-06-29 12:42:16 @JeansAndSheux starting to worry about the C02 crisis and its potential effect on the scene. I’m sure contingencies are in place and stocks of Peroni will remain in surplus. We’ve seen worse than this but for any youngsters starting out, what is your advice?
4075 2018-06-29 12:40:48 @jimcramer You often warn encourage us to begin taking gains and move money into cash when there is potential to reinvest when stocks are on sale. My question is,  does that cash just go into cash (brokerage account) or is there another place to put it where it can earn safely?

4082 2018-06-29 12:36:43 I’m predicting there will be no argument until Ultimate comes out, then there will be a ton of “Rage is less volatile now, so we don’t need a third stock for this game. 3 stocks for Sm4sh would’ve been good, but we missed our chance”
4083 2018-06-29 12:36:28 So you think it's on the smart money to completely pull out of stocks before the big dip
4084 2018-06-29 12:35:01 this man is a disgrace.he just doesn't care about anyone.he abandoned Puerto Rico & promised to make bump stocks & raise the age limit to 21 & he didn't. he only cares about using the office of President to increase his personal wealth. it is totally unethical &immoral to do this

4093 2018-06-29 12:32:11 It's almost like fish stocks are cyclical, like fishermen have always said. One down year doesn't imply doom. We saw it with 3K crab. Half the problem is that fish and shellfish don't comply to timelines set by the federal government
4094 2018-06-29 12:31:56 Probably quite a few but even if there were none it would be good news as it raises the value of its stocks and means the company becomes more successful
4095 2018-06-29 12:31:48 Shareholders getting profit, means stocks go up and therefore means the business gets more successful.
4096 2018-06-29 12:30:31 "only buy as much BTC as you can afford to lose" - while true, remember there is also a risk to keeping wealth stored in anything (whether fiat, bonds, property, stocks). We're not going to just consume all our income/wealth immediately, so we have to choose *some allocation*

4104 2018-06-29 12:24:37 Normally i would say the banks are an automatic sell the news here. But there is nobody who owns likes these stocks. so under owned and underinvested that they could move higher. if they do sell off i will add to my positions buying them with both hands

4111 2018-06-29 12:19:53 Um... The only argument for 2 stocks is For Glory. With 3 stocks you aren't as scared to lose stocks so you wont be as careful in your play which results in not being slow. It also makes it more exciting if it's 3-1 and a come back. And if you love watching it, why is more bad?

4116 2018-06-29 12:17:29 Bear in mind the advisers don't fix the cost of investments / products and advice cost driven in part by external factors. 

Also, what if the advice covers the cost of itself?  E.g. Tax effectiveness can very often save 20% of each years income!

4134 2018-06-29 12:08:51 I have been investing in @PPFAS for past 6 months or so and the fund return is net +Ve has beat the market. They are 1 of the few funds which had some exposure to FANG stocks. The fund has some of the lowest co-relation score to other major funds which helps in diversification
4135 2018-06-29 12:08:28 That's why I pointed out... Ex should be relevant.. with this excercise fund category is not changing , inside stocks are changing...ex HDFC bank can't exist in it midcap MF..

4180 2018-06-29 11:37:30 All true, but it's the individual stocks that compose the indexes that determine whether it closes red or green & by how much on any given day. The stocks themselves lead, the indexes are a derivative. Those stocks will reveal patterns that will be unseen following indexes only.
4181 2018-06-29 11:36:52 This option being "realistic" is entirely dependent on some degree of institutional acceptance.

4412 2018-06-29 07:44:31 “Attachment” always give you unhappiness more than happiness. Attachment to some perception will always bring you stress. Stocks should be categorised as Great,good,bad and gruesome for investing. And not according to their size.

4414 2018-06-29 07:42:29 It's true that small and midcap stocks create a lot of wealth. But when the downside strikes, they are responsible for a lot of capital erosion too.

Stick with the quality and have the stomach to digest the upward as well as downward volatility.
4415 2018-06-29 07:40:25 True.. that's why i don't buy MFs.
Fund managers also change and sometimes u can't do much about it either. Only option is to exit......
The effort to choose/filter a few MFs or even a single MF is as much as choosing 10-12 stocks..AGAIN a personal opinion...
4416 2018-06-29 07:40:24 This financial year so far

XIRR of Nifty 500 TRI is 7.07%. 

XIRR of our family portfolio is 15.48%

No doubt that we would have periods of under performance. The point is large quality stocks also delivers excellent returns. Large cap is not for mere downside protection.
4417 2018-06-29 07:39:20 The stocks informed today are just for the performance people ask everytime....so live feeds gave only for today.
4418 2018-06-29 07:38:44 Good point. But the mega rich also think beyond the 8% etc, for their personal security.

4437 2018-06-29 07:15:10 The below statement has ownership bias, hindsight bias and survivorship bias. 

There is an opinion that large caps do not create wealth. Last 5 year CAGR of some of the stocks I own:

4438 2018-06-29 07:14:39 did a cursory check .. both FB & Alphabet have a PE in the 31-36 range ( MUCH cheaper than Indian high value stocks) . The 2018 PE estimates are much lower........
Personally ,i wouldn't buy any stock in any other country. There are enough stocks in Indian mkts
4439 2018-06-29 07:14:38 It’s all happening, interest rates going up, FII flows drying up, rupee depreciating, regulatory action on stocks where it seemed easy to make money, PE de-rating as earnings catch up, will be interesting to see domestic flows & retail participation & 2019 
4440 2018-06-29 07:13:31 But our confidence becomes very weak in two ways. One is it more downside left. Stay or sell???
Second , I think, if stocks in the portfolio are good or cheaper stocks are out there.

4647 2018-06-29 03:53:49 it's generally better to be safe than not in this instance. But my idea comes from the fact that diversification exists because compounding risky investments, even with big returns, will always cause a loss. That's why most people have one savings account but multiple stocks.

4716 2018-06-29 02:56:33 How do you reconcile this with the lack of breadth as shown by the percentage of stocks above their 200 day MA.  Did it ever occur to you that the A/D line may be artificially influenced by the huge flow of funds into ETFs, dominated by the handful of stocks that are driving mkt?
4717 2018-06-29 02:54:52 It's a good exercise to look at a Brownian motion (BM) once in a while (a random process that mimicks the behavior of stocks). It's interesting that you'll spot many "trading patterns". BM behaves the same on all time scales (fractal). Yet, it is completely unpredictable.

4795 2018-06-29 01:57:32 Guys guys guys guys- I think I’ve solved America’s gun crisis. And, we don’t have to ban bump stocks, assault weapons or raise the purchasing age. All we need to do is have a complete and total ban on gun sales to white dudes. Problem solved! 

4796 2018-06-29 01:57:19 i transferred 100$ to  my Fidelity account. im planning on buying 4 different pot penny stocks. $25 worth of each. My reasoning is that Canada is legalizing pot nationwide. it was reccomended to buy $50 of 1 stock but im planning to buy $25 of 4. ima pray this makes me profit.
4797 2018-06-29 01:56:35 might pick up on some healthcare stocks that are on sale $AMZN

4802 2018-06-29 01:53:03 I'm actually sort of a newbie. Don't know much, but i hold a very few stocks of Rain Industries and First Source solutions. Do you suggest I stay away from the market?
4803 2018-06-29 01:52:41 It looks a little like keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill, people with a history of domestic abuse. I'm not crazy about bump stocks or high capacity magazines. Anything that could be done is better than nothing if it saves a life.

4819 2018-06-29 01:43:11 I believe every country putting tariffs on US goods have only done it because of agent orange.

stocks holder's ..owners they're trying  to govern it seems like we should know who they are at least
4838 2018-06-29 01:31:22 - Ban bump stocks - in progress already and irrelevant here
- Get rid of high capacity magazines - won't help
- Universal background checks - already exists
- Eliminate the gun show loophole - doesn't exist
- Stop civilian acquisition of assault rifles - meaningless
4839 2018-06-29 01:31:11 Surely they will bounce much more stronger than everyone EXPECTED.... But now only funda-theme-strong stocks will move , all the eggs r now out of basket.

4842 2018-06-29 01:29:18 - Ban bump stocks
- Get rid of high capacity magazines

4847 2018-06-29 01:25:06 And you continue to do nothing about gun violence in the US. The NRA keeps you muzzled and under their thumb. Bump stocks are still legal so you lied when you said you would have them banned. Kids still killed and you do nothing. @POTUS @PressSec #TrumpSwamp

4854 2018-06-29 01:19:46 Why not do something about better gun laws? Don’t have 2 ban all guns to remove assault rifles, bump stocks and other things making guns mass killing machines. U r hell bent on building a wall to prevent people from being harmed. Seems like this is in line with that sentiment.

4872 2018-06-29 01:02:13 Fully automatic guns and assault rifles are already illegal federally. You can't even buy bump stocks or mods that allow you to make a semi-automatic into full-auto legally anymore.
4873 2018-06-29 01:02:06 Maybe not a good time to have a lot of $ in spec stocks.  Blue chips not exciting but maybe safe.
4874 2018-06-29 01:01:38 Same. Mind you, we all probably hold the same or similar stocks. Then again, $CBA holders aren't exactly laughing either.
4875 2018-06-29 01:00:51 Repatriate and buy-back stocks, which boost stock prices and give more money to those with portfolios. Awesome if u have one.
But if you were in the repatriation = jobs camp....you weren’t paying attn. Low taxes don’t ALWAYS produce jobs.

4927 2018-06-29 00:19:36 Hope junior oil stocks will follow. Down today.
4928 2018-06-29 00:19:34 #ebay #stocks are tanking because they refuse to fix their site for #sellers. The site has not been properly working for months. And all you get are excuse about your listing #stockholders start holding them #accountable @eBay @devinwenig
4929 2018-06-29 00:19:00 Topical logic. Try this, if the law abiding citizens were allowed to carry he mayhave been stopped before the fatalities happened. I am not for bump stocks or for people that should not have guns having them. I am for the right to protect life from the ones trying to take one.
4930 2018-06-29 00:18:07 Love is the  to all your dreams. Apparently not- what a douchbag  living in his parents basement.
4931 2018-06-29 00:16:48 Once again overnight European and US investors diverged. European stocks fell despite a benign read on German inflation, while US stocks rose despite a slip on GDP @MicMcCarthy_CMC
4932 2018-06-29 00:16:36 Didn’t all the grocery stocks recover from their hit when Amazon bought Whole Foods?
4933 2018-06-29 00:16:04 Like my cannabis stocks are doing good but I want to invest elsewhere also.
4934 2018-06-29 00:11:21 @realDonaldTrump I remember you said you were going to ban bump stocks and raise the minimum age to buy a gun to 21.

Then you didn't

what happened?

4935 2018-06-29 00:11:08 $MU stock is probably weaker. But nooo, stocks don’t change that much how they trade around moving averages. Tomorrow could be a +3% day for micron but I’m treating it with caution because it didn’t react well last time it fell down to its 100-day moving average
4936 2018-06-29 00:11:03 Amazon going int Rx Business. They might regret as their stocks tumble.
4937 2018-06-29 00:11:01 AMZN rose $14B above what the NASDAQ average rose. Perhaps the market is saying the present value of future margins on drugs is independent of who's collecting them. AMZN +$14B (after paying out $1B) = implied value of Pill Pack to AMZN = $15B = decline in pharmacy stocks.
4938 2018-06-29 00:09:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
4939 2018-06-29 00:07:48 I need to start buying stocks and investing
4940 2018-06-29 00:07:09 Today Amazon shook pharma stocks. Pharmacy is a huge, highly controlled thru a network business, with a lot of drug control regulations. This move will be a huge new paradigm if #Amazon pulls it off.
4941 2018-06-29 00:06:52 Asia stocks begin higher across the board with the improved sentiment on Wall St rolling over to the region as trade tensions take a back seat amid no fresh developments on the trade front; ASX 200 (+0.3%), Nikkei 225 (+0.3%), KOSPI (+0.3%)
4942 2018-06-29 00:06:15 Look at Mark Warner’s FEC filings. He’s worth about 240 mil dollars (he was a businessman for decades), but now has his money in broadly diversified stocks, mutual funds, life insurance and other conflict free assets. He is a good example of what all MoC should be obligated to do
4943 2018-06-29 00:05:42 Look for the @amazon Jedi mind trick (announce an acquisition, others pay for it) to begin inflicting pain (stocks down) of Pharma firms tomorrow as fear works through drug supply chain.
4944 2018-06-29 00:05:11 Hey Jim , Dam are you trying to lose viewers?
No more lightning round no more insight on individual stocks?
It really looks like your scared to recommend any stocks in this time of market volatility
4945 2018-06-29 00:04:33 The gunman fired more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition in 11 minutes, using semi-automatic rifles modified with dangerous firearm accessories designed to dramatically accelerate the rate of gunfire, commonly known as “bump fire stocks.” Ban bump stocks!
4946 2018-06-29 00:04:29 2nd lesson, don't buy stocks based solely off Twitter posts
4947 2018-06-29 00:02:03 Guess who’s investing in stocks tomorrow and super excited about it
