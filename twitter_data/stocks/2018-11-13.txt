11 2018-11-13 23:52:37 I made a fair bit of cash off of $MXC last year but I sold out as soon as a couple of their Ann's didn't quite add up. Wouldn't touch them now, plenty of other gun pot stocks out there $BDA $CAN $AGH
12 2018-11-13 23:52:04 Looks very similar to what the Obamas did with their millions while in the White House. 
But then, they scored big holding gun & ammo stocks b/c they knew they'd scare all the gun owners. But the media say: NOTHING.
13 2018-11-13 23:51:33 You saw the losses again today? Any money stocks made this year is now gone, plus more.. Trump didn't mention that today?
14 2018-11-13 23:51:25 The rednecks and hicks saying their stocks are sky rocketing probably didn’t have a tv at home to watch that movie in the 80s and don’t have any stock to worry about either. It’s all lies and russian propaganda spreading the orange ones lies.
15 2018-11-13 23:51:14 Yeah but that's not liquid cash. Y'all should study stocks, it might make you rich some day and then you can spread the wealth!

42 2018-11-13 23:44:37 Been looking at OTC stocks lately because of their slower moves. Trying to find a consistent swing strategy
43 2018-11-13 23:44:10 I too was wondering where you were and if it were something I said (ever paranoid this end) - good to hear things are on the up and I hope energy drink stocks are not too low...
44 2018-11-13 23:42:38 You have to be kidding?  The stocks have been going down because some have just woke up and realized the president of the United States was a complete imbecile!

49 2018-11-13 23:39:45 Say "Boom" when that middle class tax break passes. Of course, corporations are optimistic. They got huge tax break and bought all the stocks back, giving themselves bonuses. Still aren't paying employees a living wage. Don't see how the majority of citizens are winning. Raindrop
50 2018-11-13 23:39:12 Bust. Salaries haven't gone up, except for CEOs. And about my stocks that pay my retirement. SHUT THE HELL Up! I can't stand anymore losses!
51 2018-11-13 23:38:43 This whole issue includes paper from sustainable sources/FSC-certified papers. Recycled stocks generally tend to be lower-quality papers so not really used as much in fine book paper as far as I know (hardcover and trade paperback, etc).
52 2018-11-13 23:38:05 Stocks have been volatile recently as investors grapple with lingering trade fears, worries about rising interest rates and the possibility of a global economic slowdown. The Cboe Volatility index, widely considered the best fear gauge, is up more than 67 percent this quarter.

54 2018-11-13 23:35:39 The question is hasn’t the types of stocks we see in the value space completely changed? Aren’t these stocks especially in the UK very reliant on a strong economy, very cyclical
55 2018-11-13 23:35:32 In bear markets stocks go down on good news.

59 2018-11-13 23:33:48 Recycled papers, even fairly low percentage recycled stocks, are still more costly than unrecycled paper at this time, I believe. I have used them in books where it's important to use recycled materials, like in environmental studies.

63 2018-11-13 23:29:32 Just to reiterate, the original tweet makes no sense.  One year of production (GDP) is worth much less than Japan's "entire economy".  Time to read up on Flows vs Stocks.
64 2018-11-13 23:27:42 I cannot wait until the NRA is labeled a health hazard. 

There's no need for any assault style weapons in the hands of civilians. We don't need high capacity magazines, bump stocks, night scopes, laser sights, or armor piercing rounds, or the need to buy thousands of ammo rounds
65 2018-11-13 23:27:28 today was probably the day most novice traders decided to wade into the shorting game. so prolly time for a face ripper. #$SPY #stocks
66 2018-11-13 23:26:54 BOOM! Dow tumbles 160 points in early Tuesday trade as rebound attempt sputters! Stocks close down once again. It’s not going to matter if our retirement is gone!
67 2018-11-13 23:26:52 In general for those price stocks you can’t use 10-15 cent stops it’s a 100 dollar stock. Ur almost guanrabteed to just get chopped out all day. Better to trade a bit looser stops with less shares
68 2018-11-13 23:26:49 So $AMZN must have known for a while about their new HQs and will now use the valuable data collected from other cities to sell to better. Pretty clever IMHO. Thoughts? $SPY $IWM $Study $Stocks

78 2018-11-13 23:21:38 Only criminals & mentally impaired are allowed to carry. Every time there is a shooting, they can't wait to make something else unlawful. They're talking about muzzle brakes, a fore pistol grip, thumb hole stocks, threaded barrels, etc.. This is no joke.
79 2018-11-13 23:21:14 Hmm. I see your point about gambling because the outcomes seem random. Tell me more about why you think it’s just gambling. Gambling is a zero sum game. But when stocks go up, many people win, including employees who are paid in stock options
80 2018-11-13 23:21:09 OK, all of you personal finance bloggers, please quit talking about how great it is to travel and instead talk about staying around and just eating out more often for a treat.  My BJRI and TXRH stocks are getting hammered.

83 2018-11-13 23:17:43 Well guide wasn’t as bad as lite and telegraphed with stocks action over past week
84 2018-11-13 23:17:16 I agree with this completely.There are extremely limited circumstances that the automatic weapons would be needed. I would think special licenses could be granted under those circumstances. One doesn’t need an AR-15 to hunt deer. I support banning assault weapons, bump stocks,etc
85 2018-11-13 23:17:15 patience is an important condition but does't work with all kind of stocks or crypto
86 2018-11-13 23:16:53 So, crude annihilated. Yet govt bonds no change. Gold unchanged. Stocks a little. Something’s not right.
87 2018-11-13 23:16:44 J’allais compléter en disant qu’il y a des situations particulières, notamment les femmes en âge de procréer, mais tu as été plus rapide.

88 2018-11-13 23:16:12 Wait, what? How do people "claim interest gained on stocks?"

Sales for Qualtrics are around $500 million, IPO was going to be between $5-6 billion, and sold to SAP for $8 billion. Will stocks for $SAP rise? #MadMoney

96 2018-11-13 23:06:06 Yes, I listened to the CC too and I liked it.  The Vitamin E thing was completely unfortunate and no way to predict.  I don't have too many shares so I'm not worried.  Such is a the way of small cap stocks.
97 2018-11-13 23:05:56 The average American is suffering. IRA and stocks are TANKING.
98 2018-11-13 23:05:16 We need the trifecta of sensible reform: close loopholes, restrictions on assault weapons/bump stocks/magazines, and real access to mental health services in this nation.

100 2018-11-13 23:04:01 Second that. If @maxkeiser were right, then #BTC would behave anti-cyclical to stocks.

But my (admittedly non-exhaustive and non-conclusive) observations are that when stocks tank, so do the major (if not all) #cryptocurrencies
101 2018-11-13 23:03:14 99% of the coins are like over the counter stocks best of breed are $btc $xrp $eth $xlm
102 2018-11-13 23:03:03 sell stocks to go to raves. That’s mad libs.
103 2018-11-13 23:02:31 You don't understand the economy.

The stocks are tied to EPS earnings per share. Profits. More profits means more expansion... More jobs. More profits also correlates to people out BUYING more. 

It's a snapshot of the economy...

Sure you would love to "adjust" reality
104 2018-11-13 23:00:37 i know it looks like a spam tweet XD thats why right after i was like fam if you do graphics go here for stocks lol
105 2018-11-13 23:00:35 You have to claim interest gained on stocks

The best way to maximize your return over the long run is to buy a Index of many different stocks
107 2018-11-13 22:59:12 Invested in a couple marijuana stocks ... I need them to help me get rich
108 2018-11-13 22:58:53 No it isn’t. Nice try.  It’s lower Apple sales and plummeting tech stocks and the latest report on our national debt, which is skyrocketing. $200 million for soldiers sleeping in tents in a Texas isn’t helping matters either. #NotMyPresident
109 2018-11-13 22:57:18 You are an a'hole! I can't see how anyone can take your advice on stocks or the market. I don't know how you sleep at night.
110 2018-11-13 22:57:07 don't waste your efforts on bump stocks.  The NRA would love to throw those out as a sacrificial lamb, again.  An AR15 is just as deadly with or without one.
111 2018-11-13 22:56:58 Wait, what? I have no idea what you're talking about. A right to claim stocks for each year worked?
112 2018-11-13 22:55:29 I’ve been tryna get into stocks but fucking Christ mate this shit so goddamn boring
113 2018-11-13 22:55:22 I know there are a few traded stocks. I used to follow them for a while but haven't looked after I moved. Worth googling to see
114 2018-11-13 22:54:24 I agree, the whole economy is artificial as long as it is centrally planned and monopolies are in charge; why I don't keep my wealth in such financial instruments. But looking at the historical data, stocks have been a better SoV long term. Not defending them, looking at data.
115 2018-11-13 22:54:11 In the U.S., a person is required to “claim” work proceeds, stocks, etc., for each year worked. So any person who works needs to send info
116 2018-11-13 22:53:49 Our "lovely" President #TheTwit @realDonaldTrump now blaming Dems for the stock market woes. He takes credit when it is good, he should be taking the same credit when it is bad. Due to Tech Stocks not meeting expectations we're having this problem. Blame it on the rain
117 2018-11-13 22:52:36 You cheating on your wife n kids with the Ho. The Stocks are falling Your Presidick is Acting like a Old Clown. Now what you saying
118 2018-11-13 22:52:04 Looks like the selling volume is drying up in the big tech names (ex aapl). Stocks going down on less and less volume. Hopefully we see a bounce after Powell speaks tomorrow after the close.
119 2018-11-13 22:51:12 Did you know... 
@FLGovScott & his wife held stocks in firms that did business with Maduro in Venezuela & a shipping firm with close ties to Putin. Also in 2018 Scott & his wife reported earnings of $2.9M in hedge funds registered in the Cayman Islands, a well-known tax haven. 
120 2018-11-13 22:47:47 This headline is so misleading $TLRY takes a hit. Stock is down a couple bucks! This stocks moves on average 5% a day and earnings were implying a 20% move.
121 2018-11-13 22:47:29 The restrictions set into place by the FDA could be a huge #Loss for Juul. I wouldnt see it hurting their #stocks and #marketshare immediately but with it becoming harder to purchase most popular flavors, this will become an issue quickly. #ECU4842

129 2018-11-13 22:43:22 Not so bright here...oil prices and tech stocks fell dramatically. Do you know that under the POTUS the stock market is up from a static low of 18K and is now 26K,
130 2018-11-13 22:42:22 That why pot stocks are positioned as the next crypto !  All smoke and no substance
131 2018-11-13 22:41:35 It sort of does. GenX almost completely abdicated its civic responsibilities. We allowed boomers to control finances for way too long because the economy was going well and everybody was making money flipping houses or trading stocks.
132 2018-11-13 22:41:29 Lately earnings have been doing nothing most of these stocks. This forces me to focus more on price action
133 2018-11-13 22:41:07 There’s no civilian use for assault rifles - high-capacity magazines - armor piercing bullets - bump-stocks… no civilian use... no one needs any of them… #NRA’s answer to Everything is “More Guns”… flood the country w/guns… now... they tell you that you need one too…
134 2018-11-13 22:40:15 Housing and stocks are purchased with leverage so yes they will outstrip inflation as along as there is inflation,when there is deflation they collapse catastrophically
Govt policy changes socialism,communism, invasions etc,can deprive the capitalist of their stocks and property

141 2018-11-13 22:36:24 Check your numbers, stocks only go up.
142 2018-11-13 22:36:11 If we look at good stocks vs. cash in the LONG RUN, stocks, even though more volatile, have held their value better than cash, which has been devalued at a steady pace. Short term cash might be better.
143 2018-11-13 22:35:16 Mais les grands renois stocks qui se mettent à 5 sur une seule fille dans les vidéos la ils ont une vraie place en enfer
144 2018-11-13 22:35:14 For some reason stocks, charts, etc people just think they can dive in. You learn foundations (math) behind indicators (so you know whats actually happening), different ways to use and so forth. I'd review their levels and curriculum and go from there.
145 2018-11-13 22:35:00 and don't be sorry that's part of the game .. but when oil moves it really moves stocks get bought on trendlines OIL just gives a fuck!
146 2018-11-13 22:32:13 "Since the tax cuts were passed, the 1,000 largest public companies have actually reduced employment, on balance. They have announced the elimination of nearly 140,000 jobs, which is almost double the 73,000 jobs they say they have created" 

Stocks lost everything gained in 2018
147 2018-11-13 22:31:16 Didn't hear about it. You've missed the biggest boom in a century though. And stocks by far outperform every other asset class.
148 2018-11-13 22:30:15 I'd think that an even handed commentator would bring up the 200 day MA, how we're below it, and can't meaningfully break through, other than the dead cat bounce last Wednesday. I don't think I've seen you comment on the upside resistance even once. I'd like to see that! #stocks

155 2018-11-13 22:24:41 That means there is plenty of leeway for unconventional monetary policy in some currency zones. Imagine QE buying up stocks. Well that happens already in some zones as you all know. Sad, weird, dangerous. This is contemporary finance after all.
156 2018-11-13 22:24:02 Before stocks of foreign booze run out?
157 2018-11-13 22:23:56 Unlikely to happen. Cryptos are still seen as a risk asset by the majority of investors. If stocks crash, cryptos will crash too. And even PMs...

159 2018-11-13 22:22:19 Well Jim apparently you have not been adequately monitoring the sustainability of our aquatic stocks,  so how do you expect a positive trade outcome??
160 2018-11-13 22:21:43 @GuyAdami Guy/FastMoney traders, weren't you ALL SO BULLISH on oil stocks when oil was at $78 and you thought it was heading to $85-90?  You guys NEED to have Top-Rated analysts speaking, they know. You guys are just guessing. Also buying $AAPL & high-PE Techs was BAD ADVICE too
161 2018-11-13 22:21:32 @GarageDayTrader Do you make a premarket plan on stocks, or just identify main candidates and wait for setup to form out of open? I’ve heard both strategies but lately have been practicing with no premarket plan, just waiting for watchlist to show entries
162 2018-11-13 22:21:32 @WE_Williams Skin in the game, that corporations decide what to pay us? Is that what you mean? If you don;'t take the BAIT of poor wages, then what, criminality or working for  a CEO's stocks, compensation or management control? Human rights include economic fairness income wise.

168 2018-11-13 22:15:37 That said, bump stocks and anything else that is not a human finger pulling the trigger each time should all be classed as automatic weapons. I'm also totally in favor of requiring training and special permission to have a semi-automatic (self loading) weapon.

179 2018-11-13 22:08:46 US stocks have risen as technology stocks bounced back after a steep sell-off in the previous session and hopes of progress in the US-China trade talks boosted industrials, even though a decline in @Apple curbed gains

200 2018-11-13 21:54:54 The great thing with trading momentum is that you don't need to 'predict' what the next market leaders will be. These stocks now popping up:

That said, broader market trend is down. Low probability to trade on upside here.

Any stable currency will then be better than most asset
248 2018-11-13 21:29:26 Markets were supposed to rally according to TV stock peddlers...but no! Stocks continue their swoon and I believe election results will stop further gains until 2020 is clear. Sure trading rallies can happen, but smart money will sell them.

261 2018-11-13 21:22:25 You do realize that bump stocks don't actually make an AR fully automatic right? And I could just as easily bump fire with my belt loop. Also, I don't appreciate my tools of self defense being limited or taken away by the government who's salary I pay involuntarily.
262 2018-11-13 21:22:11 World stocks mixed: Europe +.7%; US -.2%. Early day US rally short-circuited by sharp drop in oil. Currently, no catalyst for rally. Expect US-China talks to produce an agreement that Trump can claim as victory but won't change much. Still, will be enough to spur solid rally.
263 2018-11-13 21:22:10 Despite Nouriel being an idiot I don’t think it’s that insane of a proposition. I can only think of a handful of S&P stocks that if they went under their shareholders would receive one nickle from the company. Obv shares would be worthless in that scenario so where is the value?

268 2018-11-13 21:20:44 Very smart. The hottest stocks in the hottest sectors are always tricky & sensitive. Meanwhile, bargains abound in unloved sectors like financials & energy. Market hates ‘em now. Maybe a place to look.

271 2018-11-13 21:20:10 Ese gráfico se puede interpretar de muchas maneras y tener su lógica pero lo cierto es que estamos debajo de la media de 200 días, mucha precaución.
272 2018-11-13 21:20:01 CNBC: Stock market charts point to more trouble ahead: Small cap stocks close to 'death cross'

CNBC: Even as stocks steady after Monday's selloff, some charts still look dicey and that could be a warning for the broader market....

307 2018-11-13 21:05:42 @WilfredFrost Mr. Frost. Lower oil is only a positive for every company every consumer all of the United States. Anyone who says differently is wrong. The market is wrong. When everyone is so negative this is when you buy stocks. It’s over done on nothing
308 2018-11-13 21:05:36 I get lost in class checking stocks.. i don’t know whether that’s good or bad.

313 2018-11-13 21:04:20 Wise decision. I love my sub 100m U stocks, but I was mentally prepared to lose them and wanted to make sure I still made money on the move by having exposure to the producers.
314 2018-11-13 21:03:46 Even in college, u can take endless finance courses and learn about time value, annuities, perpetuities, stocks & bonds which is great but never gain any insight on student loans. Wouldn't be a smart business move for the school.
315 2018-11-13 21:03:29 Idk man.. Looks easier than crypto somehow.. 
I've been trading stocks more succesfull than crypto...
316 2018-11-13 21:03:13 Market is closed finally, biotechs just no stopping in individual stocks getting pounded day after day.
317 2018-11-13 21:02:58 he did not blame the democrats for it going down since it is up to where it's suppose to be. The dow is only by how people feel about certain stocks and which way there going.Not good to lie to people who do the stock market it shows how little you know
318 2018-11-13 21:02:32 Just interested - commodities move the same way as stocks? Considering oil.
319 2018-11-13 21:02:30 When I look at the forest in totality (capital markets) instead of the trees independently (oil, rates, currencies, stocks) you know what I see?

A global (economic) war being fought along several fronts.

Throw out your playbooks until there’s a detente...
320 2018-11-13 21:01:53 That tends to happen with small, untested companies in a hot sector, like marijuana is now. The best advice I can give is be patient: if you really want to buy into this, you’ll get many chances as market moves will be more pronounced in these stocks.
321 2018-11-13 21:00:45 Anyone have the % of stocks below 200 daily sma for $SPY $QQQ $IWM. Im curious to see if its more than 50% @allstarcharts do you know the stats? Seeing the big ones dropping below.

Re French wine trade.
Interesting factoid: GIs coming into France w/ Normandy landing brought a disease called phytophthora on their boots. It wiped out the wine producing grape stocks. But American wine grape stocks were immune to it.
323 2018-11-13 21:00:13 I try to see all sides but I'm hard pressed to see any side where $TLRY blows out earnings tonight.  But maybe bad news that isn't horrid is bought given I'm hardly alone in this POV but that works best when stocks are deeply oversold.

Stay tuned in 3, 2....
324 2018-11-13 21:00:09 Is there a way to short this through stocks? shorts or put options? ETFs seem too broad  $FLBL $SNLN $FTSL $SRLN... who's providing the insurance as part of the CLOs/CDOs? can that somehow be shorted?
325 2018-11-13 20:59:23 I'll amend my bump stock suggestion, just to see what you'll say:

You can only get charged w/possessing a bump stock ONLY with an existing felony:

Example:
A drug bust where Cops find bump stocks…they add the bump stock charge to the drug felony
326 2018-11-13 20:59:22 $SGLB Looking good for a breakout...plus news this morning. Possible run to 2.50+ soon

330 2018-11-13 20:58:00 Yes "sin stocks" must be avoided as a first step, then their financials should be in order after that (no high debt, etc)

333 2018-11-13 20:56:34 I watched a video by a man named rickard who said the globalist elite are going to create a new currency to go around the American dollar. This is supposed to hurt American stocks. The media is already set to blame trump. The globalists are fighting back, be prepared.

351 2018-11-13 20:49:32 Pretty much all stocks are down especially since August
352 2018-11-13 20:49:23 This is ridiculous. Low oil prices helps EVERY other sector EXCEPT energy. From dramatically reduced costs for transportation and shipping of product, to lower commuting expense, we are ALL ahead. It only drags down the indexes because big oil stocks are IN them.
353 2018-11-13 20:49:22 Trying to use 25 dollars on the Robinhood app for trading stocks. (Thx @themorningtoast). Asked my CPA brother what I should buy. He’s like “I’d start with investing 2 grand in Amazon” ....oh. But wut will 25 doll hairs get me

Even funnier that it was for a restraint device. #femdom
357 2018-11-13 20:47:56 You’ll see a lot more of this activity due to Mifid2. Fewer professional analysts means that spivy anonymous bloggers will have a field day writing whatever they like about under-researched stocks to support their PA trading positions.

360 2018-11-13 20:46:28 Did you know... 
@FLGovScott & his wife held stocks in firms that did business with Maduro in Venezuela & a shipping firm with close ties to Putin. Also in 2018 Scott & his wife reported earnings of $2.9M in hedge funds registered in the Cayman Islands, a well-known tax haven. 
361 2018-11-13 20:46:27 Yes.. I hear that. I just want to facilitate some shorts (or protection) in the form of Stocks... either shorts or put options.... and not sure what a related stock may be for loans to low rated companies including insurance (CLOs / CDOs)

363 2018-11-13 20:46:14 Could be a shocker tomorrow for oil stocks. Brent oil 7.5% down
364 2018-11-13 20:45:10 Seems like the market is discounting deflation here: crude down 8%, gold down, stocks down, Treasuries up. And meanwhile the fed wants to keep raising rates.

366 2018-11-13 20:44:41 @Google why did you change Google Finance? It is honestly terrible. Ticker changes don’t update. When-issued stocks that go regular-way don’t show up. Just two examples. Let’s start with those and then I’ll follow up.
367 2018-11-13 20:44:21 @DavidGFool @TomGardnerFool - being part of Motley universe since 2011 has made this last month bearable in watching my accts. No drastic plan needed, take comfort in nibbling on solid recs from the Fooliverse of stocks. Always goes up more than down 
368 2018-11-13 20:43:51 Which in a masterful feat of rationality hasn't prevented LNG carriers and producers stocks to sink like stones in the past two weeks.

371 2018-11-13 20:42:48 It is the same old story with the VIX remaining relatively subdued during this correction--Bull case for stocks: Not much to worry about despite oil, $GS, $AAPL weakness, etc...Bear case for stocks: Market remains very complacent and will soon see heavier selling to instill fear.
372 2018-11-13 20:42:21 Usually they are Ponzi schemes . If you don’t understand the basics, why bother ? Even stocks, with its history hardly guarantees quick money. BIG SCAM
373 2018-11-13 20:41:59 If your a long term investor, who cares? Way too much of a lottery mentality in stocks. As Warren Buffett says when you are buying a stock , you are buying into a business.

386 2018-11-13 20:36:20 @LizClaman How about some positive news every once in a while? Surely there are SOME stocks that are doing well, or, SOME positive events happening in the country??? You never talk about anything positive. Your whole show is negative, negative, negative! Please turn that around!

391 2018-11-13 20:33:08 So ignorant. Corporations took the tax money that Drumpf gave, bought back their stocks. Never grew their businesses.  Harley is gone, Lowe’s shutting stores, farmers are getting screwed with soybean prices.  Once in a  read Wall Street Journal.

400 2018-11-13 20:23:57 Another weak day for stocks as they limp to the close. After all how can you have faith that Trump will make a trade deal??? This issue has been on the table for too long. Enough of these tariff threats. This approach has issues.

404 2018-11-13 20:23:09 What is everyone doing out there?!?! I have yet to see this slow of a November on some type of stocks in 8 years...
405 2018-11-13 20:22:35 Right, don’t worry about why oil has fallen off a cliff. Just buy stocks because everyone will have more money to blow on shit they don’t need.  Seems legit
406 2018-11-13 20:22:03 Savings is good but more than a few months reserves in your savings account is losing money on inflation.  Start a retirement account, buy property, stocks, or even just precious metals for the long haul.

432 2018-11-13 20:08:50 Short answer is ONE thing: SHORT their stocks.

1) Rising rates mean margins on existing loans will shrink, lowering the bottom line.

2) Rising rates mean decelerating top line = lower multiples and EPS growth.

The deficit is up b/c gov revenue has gone down since tax cut & military spending has gone up.
643 2018-11-13 18:14:23 Creo que es una predicción legítima,pero arriesgada.
644 2018-11-13 18:13:03 318 stocks in my SMID universe.  67% off more than 20% from highs.  91 stocks down 30-50% from highs. Avg off hi for 318 = 25%.  Its time we start calling this a bear market.

650 2018-11-13 18:07:44 What's good 4 the goose is good 4 the gander. If we see the President's tax returns, then we should see the member's of Congress's tax returns2. We want to know where these congress people are getting their millions from. What off shore accounts they have. What stocks they own.

Unnamed sources suggest #Brexit deal has been agreed bu EU & UK - still a bit of wood to chop, but #GBP gaining on talk; oil tanked by 4.5% on oversupply concerns, now well in bear-market territory; US and China talking quietly on trade, support US stocks; #NZD steady.
652 2018-11-13 18:05:53 I've been telling everyone for months now dump stocks. I've moved mostly to physical gold and stuck with tech. A lot of companies 401's invest in stock and not mutual funds move it until market corrections happen. I lost 90k in 2008 it won't happen again.

690 2018-11-13 17:53:33 $NVTA down 7% . Testing 12 on it's way to 8-10.  You are way to eager and take pride in buying on early red days due long bias but its costing you lot. Posting buys $ROKU NVTA and having stocks tank 8-13% just 1 or 2 later means you need  better understanding of timing & entry.

699 2018-11-13 17:47:09 Stocks on the long term yes but in that you also have a positive drift, a hit rate of 70% in something that trades like crypto or forex protracted over a long period of time and not in a cluster is probably bs.

702 2018-11-13 17:46:28 YES:  Tougher regulation of safer products such as vaporizers (e-cigarettes) always boosts Big Tobacco stocks because BT companies' revenue still comes predominantly from the sale of deadly combustible tobacco products like cigarettes.  Most of the vaping industry is not BT.
703 2018-11-13 17:46:17 Absolutely on the bump stocks. And I can live without a silencer. Let's be real: anyone using a gun for protection WANTS it to make a loud boom! Also, ZERO TOLERANCE for 3D printing schematics being released to the public. That is INSANE.
704 2018-11-13 17:45:58 Bump stocks I'm against. As for civilian ownership of AR-15s, supposedly that's constitutionally protected for the creation of private citizens' militias especially when needed to resist tyranny. Up until this administration I would've laughed that off as anachronistic.

715 2018-11-13 17:43:27 If bump stocks were illegal,maybe the Vegas guy uses an alternative method, I can admit that…

But you have to admit that maybe he wouldnt have used a bump stock OR an alternative method…

768 2018-11-13 17:21:08 S4: 2 stocks 6 minutes

Ultimate: 3 stocks

You would expect that to take 1.5x as long in a game with the same pace. Meaning 9 minutes if it was the same pace. 9 minutes is a long ass time and promotes camping so itd prob be shortened to 8. Ultimate is much faster than s4. 7.

773 2018-11-13 17:20:07 FSCS hasn’t reimbursed £1500 initial fee, taken into account ongoing IFA fees and the guys haven’t had their 5% penalty fees reimbursed distinctly.  A combi of Oct 2017 rule change and BSPS/GMP nuance means some get up to £50k, some get nothing.  The 5%+£1500 should be distinct.

893 2018-11-13 16:29:49 It currently feels like there’s a few breakouts occurring but not much volume to go with them.

Not my ideal scenario.

894 2018-11-13 16:28:49 All CDN earnings is really doing is highlighting how forward-valued all these stocks are. Eventually, most of the Tier-1's will grow into their valuations. It's all good when risk assets are in favor. When they're aren't (like today's environment), not so much.

899 2018-11-13 16:26:43 Good point! Also, Actions always speak louder than words too. Probably just wishful thinking. Probably why despite the talk the stocks will continue to rise, people will continue to be forced to only their pharmacies, & our pharmacist will continue to get paid poorly.  Just sad.
900 2018-11-13 16:25:33 I was told it was because a national holiday closes the commercial banks (and therefore the govt bond market) but not the stock market. This was back when separation within investment organizations (banks weren’t permitted to be involved in stocks) Not the case now.

913 2018-11-13 16:20:42 Exactly.  Allegedly.  I do not have stocks or ownership in Arizona Grill but people need to understand that there is a process for implication۔

918 2018-11-13 16:18:18 No, Nick. But stopping mass shootings through sensible gun reforms (ie background checks, no bump stocks, etc) will be a priority.

923 2018-11-13 16:15:15 I see stocks have plenty room to run on 30 minutes chart with 5sma uptrending are:

$BA
$AMD
$SPY
924 2018-11-13 16:15:13 Les stocks peuvent impacter les pics. De plus, le Brent est un indicateur qui ne détermine qu'une courte majorité des bruts.
Ce qui est, en revanche, très facile à trouver, c'est l'augmentation des taxes. En 2018, 7,6c€/l de Gazole, 3,9c€/l d'essence. 
Point barre.
925 2018-11-13 16:14:38 That is precisely why I have not put on the full short -- gov't intervention in these markets -- what we just saw was reckless behavior by an out of control admin that continues to recycle fake news almost every week about trade to save stocks while destroying market structure.
926 2018-11-13 16:13:41 stocks rise by 1%.
927 2018-11-13 16:13:34 i'm 1/3 of the way on my 3-year short on intel stocks and i'm not even thinking of ending it. thanks, intel.
928 2018-11-13 16:13:34 Everyone I know with a gun cares about bump stocks and thinks there is absolutely no reason for them to be sold in the open market. Using your logic, there is no reason to outlaw anything bc bad guys will still commit crimes.
929 2018-11-13 16:12:58 Yes I know. Ive been run over trying to short this thing on rebounds. It can run 125 points lol. This became like Bitcoin. Mega cap stocks never traded like this with 3 and 4 % daily moves
930 2018-11-13 16:12:41 So again rapid fire or automatic weapons although legal are uncommon. Bump stocks are also uncommon-I’ve only heard of the one in Vegas and none of my shooting buddys have them.  Basically non-issued. Haven’t heard of rapid fire gun used in mass shooting
931 2018-11-13 16:12:34 Ok lets use your dummy logic…A rubber band is less reliable & less durable than a bump stock…

So if we ban bump stocks then the criminals would have to use a less reliable, less durable work-around…

Why is that a bad thing???
932 2018-11-13 16:12:28 Ex, healthy stocks 
933 2018-11-13 16:11:29 I'm going to need to hide in my hole and recover from that rock you threw at my head while i was in the town stocks on an early winter's morn
934 2018-11-13 16:11:20 It’s sad people arguing over pieces of plastic. I wonder how many legit stocks they have.... probably <.01 so at that these pointless pissing contests from any gamers to be cool. It’s sad cuz most are adults. Well legal age adults, maturity extremely lacking. Grow up
935 2018-11-13 16:10:54 Now, tepid growth projections, waivers granted to several buyers of Iranian crude and robust supply have sent oil prices into a tailspin. The plunge has spread to other assets, with copper and gold down last week and US stocks dropping.
936 2018-11-13 16:10:14 and I ask again, what harm would come if bump stocks were to be banned???
937 2018-11-13 16:09:42 VAT on Engergy has a special low rate 5%, std VAT rate is 15% UK govt sets 20% they've never bothered to lower it so no reason to suppose that would change. UK has benefited from CFP re quotas + increased fish stocks. Bendy Bananas is outdated, keep up! What problem with  FoM?
938 2018-11-13 16:09:41 $VXX off its day highs but can still bite. Under 36 good but may not stick. Under 35 much better odds IMO of having a rally in stocks that sticks at COD.

940 2018-11-13 16:09:33 Where is the ban on bump stocks? Where are the common sense gun controls? Do something about #GunControlNow Didn't you promise to do something about bump stocks after Las Vegas?
941 2018-11-13 16:09:22 Tous les ans on a les mêmes rumeurs ... c’est du juste des décalages de stocks donc d’activité ... pas eu d’attente cette année ! Et au final les résultats sont toujours là ... permet surtout aux gros de racheter pas cher ;-)
942 2018-11-13 16:09:15 I suppose constant replacements will exhaust their stocks of that batch prettt quickly at least...
943 2018-11-13 16:09:15 again with the dumbest logic in the world…Just b/c somebody could use a rubber band, does NOT mean Bump stocks should stay legal
944 2018-11-13 16:09:09 Maybe in the #toosoon category for anyone caught long today, but global balances were actually much tighter last week with ex-US crude stocks falling for the first time since Sept, incl an utterly massive #OPEC draw. Maybe KSA trying to scare the shit out of everyone else? #OOTT
945 2018-11-13 16:09:07 PG&E stocks plunge as deadly Camp Fire ravages through Northern California
946 2018-11-13 16:07:54 When the consumers not happy, we don't buy and stocks drop cuz investors bail. They need to make both happy or not give so much ground to someone like Activision.
947 2018-11-13 16:07:52 I've no idea. That's the point of my jab ... the rational things that move other stocks in somewhat predictable ways just don't apply to the #CannabisStocks #MarijuanaStocks #PotStocks. In all fairness, we all loved that fact on the way up ... on the way down, not so much.
948 2018-11-13 16:07:30 No one needs a rapid fire weapon or bump stocks.

952 2018-11-13 16:05:33 1. According to the Motley Fool, who was analyizing stocks, only 22% of Americans own guns. 2% of Americans own 50% of all guns. The majority of criminals aquire guns by thieft, or from no- background-check venues, like gun shows and private sales....
953 2018-11-13 16:05:29 I suggest we bring back stocks as a means of punishment. Let them be ridiculed in Nathan Phillips Square for the taking of liberties with the civility of their victims. @allnews2nite
954 2018-11-13 16:05:04 It would be different if marquee games vs. hot teams were dropped in annually like basketball, but you are buying long-term stocks in FB schedules. Say UConn signs a deal today with Clemson for 2028? Yay! What if Clemson is 4-8 in 10 years?
955 2018-11-13 16:04:54 Hi Tweeps! Not much of a bounce in stocks today - though interested parties are trying hard! I'm positioned for a bear market and I hope non-expert investors don't get caught out!
956 2018-11-13 16:04:48 making bump stocks illegal will dwindle its circulation…Eventually leading to is extinction…Had we banned bump stocks in the 80's maybe Las Vegas would have been as bad…And if 1 life would have been saved…that's a HUGE fix for that family

961 2018-11-13 16:03:19 You might be joking but I do believe the sec is going to make an example out of some people before this is all said and done. Had this been stocks 100s would be in jail already. Dont think for a minute they are not paying attention.

964 2018-11-13 16:01:47 Peter Lynch in his book said, these kind of Stocks (Stalwarts,in US markets) not for long-term(in 90's,so what about now?),sell after 50% profit & one more thing is long-term returns of FMCG bluechips not so great (don't know about this one) coz of poor earning growth.
965 2018-11-13 16:01:44 Maybe stop shoving your sht into animals & our food stocks.

That might be a start.
966 2018-11-13 16:01:10 Maybe, maybe not. Example: when MMs learned which stocks were going to be in one bucket they might have shifted trading resources and technology development in advance of the actual pilot. (It's a stretch, I know.)  But why guess? The data is right there before @SEC_DERA's eyes!
967 2018-11-13 16:00:28 I appreciate you saying that because sometimes I feel like people in those groups talk about rental properties so casually like it's not a big deal. Not to mention stuff like what if your tenant's power goes out at 2 a.m.? I'm just saying - stocks are much simpler.

973 2018-11-13 15:58:51 US markets looks to have intra-day bottom now - DAX rally hard, if oil bounce back, stocks bounce - shorts need ti take a profits before regretting
974 2018-11-13 15:58:48 Likely broad selling. 80% of stocks move based on the general market.
975 2018-11-13 15:58:02 Many often look at stocks with backing of some high profile investors. The thought in itself is a complete flaw. Stocks don't have memory or who the owner is.

990 2018-11-13 15:52:43 The fact that you have a time frame that you are going to "stay away" from "stock picking" means you are opinionated and likely to miss the very best stocks.

995 2018-11-13 15:51:05 @jimcramer Cramer! When researching the 22 trillion debt problem as it pertains to the economy and stocks in the years ahead, it’s hard to find material that is not tainted by political bias.

How big is this problem? Can stocks continue to go up if it breaches 25 trillion? 30T?

1015 2018-11-13 15:46:44 October. This is one of the peculiarly dangerous months to speculate in stocks. The other months are July, January, September, April, November, May, March, June, December, August, and February. Glad to be helpful...

1134 2018-11-13 15:06:21 IMHO ONLY!I sold my Advance Auto Parts (AAP)stock.The stock is soaring today ibecause everyone believes the company will report good quarterly report.Let just say that AAP has been good to me but when some "experts" expect a good report often I've seen stocks turn sour. No thanks

1140 2018-11-13 15:03:18 I support background checks and mandatory waiting periods. I support bans of bump stocks. I support "red flag" laws that order a judge to block a person from possessing a gun if they are proven to be a threat to others, such as domestic abusers and the severely mentally ill.
1141 2018-11-13 15:02:56 Only if it’s the will of God. The people lose hope when there’s no hope in them. When Moses lost confidence,God told him to do what He instructed. He set Arron to speak for him. Taking money out of stocks isn’t going forward, it’s bending over. Don’t make it about vanity.Hope&Do!
1142 2018-11-13 15:02:52 Stocks with no dividends are more volatile, but growth stock investors are focused on capital gains, not income.  The critical valuation issue come when growth slows and cash generation exceeds reinvestment needs in core high growth area. Regular  dividends? M&A? Special payouts?
1143 2018-11-13 15:02:19 @sahneydeepak I waited for more upside and eventually SOLD at 1383, but made a good profit. You seems to Sold it almost at the peak of the day. How do you know its peak and will go down further?

1251 2018-11-13 14:20:42 lets examine prior periods, compare portfolio construction in 2018 vs 1985. look at weightings of Cash/Bonds and Stocks. Today weighting are massively overweighted stocks because cash and bonds yield nothing.
1252 2018-11-13 14:20:36 Oh, yeah. This must be “liberals” that caused this. Eight years of stock market gains that you take credit for, then when your stupid tariffs cause tech stocks to drop, you’re blaming everyone else? Sorry, you big orange toddler, IT DOESN’T WORK THAT WAY.
1253 2018-11-13 14:19:27 Yes. The Ds are looking into Trump's crooked ways. Sell all my stocks immediately!! ......said no one......
1254 2018-11-13 14:19:16 Apple shares are set to slide again. But unlike yesterday, it doesn't look like the broader market is set to tank. I'll be talking about $AAPL and other stocks in the news with @jchatterleyCNN on @cnni @firstmove just after 9:30 ET.
1255 2018-11-13 14:19:15 Dow will lose another 1000 points by mid december. Play safe. #stocks #options #prediction
1256 2018-11-13 14:19:14 Microcap* 

Go around bashing people for pumping stocks when your doing the exact same shit when yours are green, but when they're red you say buy the dip as it shouldn't be near these levels.... as it continues to drop. Fuck outta here bunch of hypocrites.
1257 2018-11-13 14:18:28 I agree they are over valued at current juncture. Even auto stocks are overvalued
1258 2018-11-13 14:17:45 لاااااا حول ولا قوة الا بالله

1259 2018-11-13 14:16:57 If some good stocks is undervalued and available at more than 50% discount rate based on it's future cash flow valuation.....

1268 2018-11-13 14:12:23 Mining stocks ( gold & silver ) getting the investors in to their own private hells as usual, lol.  No one who enters this sector can avoid the pain, but few are aware that mega upsides are in store over next two years.  Market makers want you to give up and walk away now.
1269 2018-11-13 14:11:41 Your trade decisions are now directly hitting the industries. That is why stocks drop. # Bankrupt Trump.

Who was in those stocks that went up - No one ? Not true.
Followers of @KeithMcCullough  at  @Hedgeye  nailed it exactly for the last 6 weeks.
1271 2018-11-13 14:11:13 $spx #stocks I like these levels but don’t read much into futures. We are just back near support level where we bounced yesterday maybe 4x before diving last ten minutes. It’ll take a few hours today to see if it’s really going to rally or dip further. $aapl weak in pre-market.

1274 2018-11-13 14:10:22 My financial advisor says they fear a Corbyn government more than a no deal brexit,the stock market plummeted on 24.6.16 but ended up higher. Ask your provider what determines its value ie stocks and shares, gilts bonds etc and then do a bit of research

1279 2018-11-13 14:08:54 Hey Crypto friends, Now is the time to buy crypto if you have not yet learned it is better than stocks with better returns than any bank. Honey, Dart, Zeus, Peony, & Sky coin are building up their value weekly! Get some!
1280 2018-11-13 14:08:27 It’s all Keynes’s is beauty pageant now. The question asked is not “what do I think?,” but “what’ll other people think?

1281 2018-11-13 14:07:58 have my eye on $roku for a swing trade if we get some weakness this morning. Stocks been hammered since earnings. Mkt will open up a bit, going to wait & c if we sell off a bit b4 any trades. don't have confidence in any initial pop in mkt right now
1282 2018-11-13 14:06:20 Not in the stamens. Cook said 'very little' data. If it was stocks would have dropped next day. Not yesterday.
1283 2018-11-13 14:05:56 Further CNBC compliance team should investigate vested interests of anchors. Since they r not allowed to invest in stocks but only through IPOs, OFS, ETFs You will find them trying hard to promote CPSE ETF stocks like Coal India. They twist bad results into good.

1285 2018-11-13 14:04:54 Why are stocks responding in such a negative way @davidfaber?

* Too many on the same side of the boat (long)

1286 2018-11-13 14:04:50 There is more than one way to become wealthy - starting a business, investing in rental properties, investing in stocks, working in a high income profession for years, etc. - but there is a common trend among all people who become wealthy: they spend less than they earn.
1287 2018-11-13 14:04:49 Not one of these stocks wants to stand on their own.
1288 2018-11-13 14:03:51 Crypto currency is the future... right now it’s like stocks and shares but in the long run it’ll eventually be the only money source. You have to get into it...
1289 2018-11-13 14:02:26 stocks are swinging wildly. but the biggest tech stocks -- the ones that carried the market to ATHs -- are swinging much more wildly.

1291 2018-11-13 14:01:53 There is already so much bad news baked into $AAPL it can't get any worse unless the company decided to stop selling iPhones all-together. A beautiful set up crafted by the analyst. If you think this wasn't pre-meditated and planned, you shouldn't trade stocks.

1307 2018-11-13 13:56:29 Yeah, that's not part of our strategy at all.  At the most we only hold a day or two but even then it's risky.  But thanks for your response!
1308 2018-11-13 13:55:51 And we will look after it. The Spanish, Portuguese and French boats under CAP rules ruined the fish stocks and breeding grounds; they traveled faster & suffocated the fish, had smaller holes in nets and used bottom drag method etc.

1313 2018-11-13 13:52:02 All good news, but does that translate to seeing the stock continue to spike this morning or do traders take some gains this morning before seeing a bounce back up?  Just trying to figure out how Tim judges a stock to spike in the morning or is ready to dip buy the morning panic
1314 2018-11-13 13:51:56 Strange  My portfolio buy list keeps expanding even with the mkt  downturn.  I have said many times the controlled indexes needed to adjust to the rest of the market.

1315 2018-11-13 13:51:45 The stocks are made by other designers and photographers. It's basically stealing someone else's work. But if the stocks are made by the designer, it will be allowed.

1322 2018-11-13 13:49:51 #Stocks,#Indexes The reassessment of the recent SPX "minor" top signal at 2798 renders all long positions untenable. The counter trend rally is virtually finished.

1335 2018-11-13 13:45:02 Do you sell stocks or use options? Thanks
1336 2018-11-13 13:44:00 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX bottom signal is not a particularly strong one. Moreover, the recent SPX top signal, originally qualified as "minor" looks more major. Such observations point to a rally failing unexpectedly early, possibly at 2750. Duration beyond 2-3 days is improbable.

1355 2018-11-13 13:33:49 But like, buy stocks???
1356 2018-11-13 13:33:20 The problem with stocks like this is they spend most of the time dropping until the next bit of news.
1357 2018-11-13 13:32:02 (1/2) I can not stress enough how dangerous some of these #growth stocks are here. Radically overowned by investors who have dog-piled into them at a "herding rate" unseen since the 1-year period bracketing the Dot-Com Bubble peak.

1360 2018-11-13 13:30:19 “massive liquidity” is just leverage, and when margin calls and losses start to appear in different areas—emerging markets, European equities, U.S. tech stocks—the liquidity that most investors count on to continue to fuel the rally simply vanishes. -Daniel Lacalle
1361 2018-11-13 13:30:02 Better still why not let fish stocks recover by under fishing or sell to the rest of the world ! Let EU buy on the open market- the EU is responsible for the destruction of west African fishing grounds due to unfair trade deal we must not follow suit

1363 2018-11-13 13:28:16 $SPY Some sell stocks lower for a bigger loss but have much difficulty selling into a rally to take a smaller loss. Don't let this be you.
1364 2018-11-13 13:27:42 My favourite barometer for US stocks #AMZN feels like it could fall another 30% down towards the $1200 level.  Although at the moment the downside fall feels abit extended.  I would probably not initiate any shorts as of yet. Could see SantaClaus rally into the new year.

1376 2018-11-13 13:20:30 One other thought on these E&P's, many of the recent biggest winning stocks have been very low hedged, so let's see if the more hedged companies start to outperform if oil prices continue to fall. The ride up is fun, but that drop is a killer without protection.

More importantly, it's legal.

1495 2018-11-13 12:11:07 NOTICE-as I said the"rotation"not rotation because now traders will be fixating on ,completely,different new stocks which r BORING but not as stupid as the FANGS.I told u yesterday but did u listen?NOPE.

1501 2018-11-13 12:08:41 Just because packs have been a thing forever doesn't mean its the right thing to do. Anyone can find for viable stocks if you know what you're searching for and know how to clean them up. Its basically taking money from kids who don't know what they're doing in Ps

1504 2018-11-13 12:08:05 Asking for a mentor/friend. I am looking to purchase stock however I am questioning if I should wait until I can purchase more than like 5 or 2. I’m a super noob but THE TIME IS NOW!  #stocks #stockmarket #mentorneeded #mindset #investing #Buy #investments @garyvee
1505 2018-11-13 12:07:48 I mostly use agar for streaking frozen stocks, or for CFU counts- so I guess contamination would be easy to spot. Probably wouldn't try it for cloning as you end up PCR screening so many non-runners, that I wouldn't want to add even more uncertainty to the mixer.
1506 2018-11-13 12:07:05 @CellC @HollardInsure are crookes. @TelkomZA please approve my contract and have stocks. I am leaving cellc after more that 6 years of my loyalty to them. They have no customer service.

1508 2018-11-13 12:05:27 This whole EU army thing is bearish while it stays as "talks" but more bullish than a QE for European stocks if it gets real.
1509 2018-11-13 12:04:25 Yes it is. It’s analogous as to the trade off between investing in volatile stocks vs stable bonds as asset classes. That tolerance for pain you talked about is key. Enjoyed the conversation, look fwd to your next appearance in Mike’s podcast! Looks great
1510 2018-11-13 12:04:20 Really? do you know which country manages  COD stocks better than any other country in the world? Norway, it is not part of the EU or its common fisheries policy, it manages and controls its own waters and fish stocks and they are thriving. Please explain?
1511 2018-11-13 12:03:26 Nothing wrong with hitting the eject button. As long you don't snob those stocks, let time to reassess them, and reenter if they still fit in the trading plan. Taking chips off the table and missing out on a great hand is not the same as losing. $study

1513 2018-11-13 12:03:01 Majority of the stocks are overpriced - with worrisome (and high) P/B ratios.
1514 2018-11-13 12:02:06 That's what it costs to free ourselves from tyrants bleeding the country dry financially and allowing its countrymen to raid our fishing stocks. etc, It is worth it. In twenty years we will be enjoying the freedom. Don't sccaremonger. :)

1544 2018-11-13 11:40:50 2- Point 1 can be generalized to any IOUs .One way to pay an issuer is to give back to him any of his own IOU (stocks,bonds).The difficulty is that the term to maturity is not zero (the issuer didn't promise to accept on demand) so payment with such IOU requires issuer's consent.
1545 2018-11-13 11:38:39 I suggest you stop teaching fishermen how to fish. There is always a market for fresh fish. The EU won't refuse to buy our fish. If they did, there is a very healthy domestic market. Fishing fleets will be rebuilt. Fish stocks will recover in the meantime.

1598 2018-11-13 10:54:54 Agree.  Thx Ben.

my broader point is, to understand bubbles popping and stagflation, one must consider the fed’s policy framework and the global economy. 

Ppl focus too much on “high” US stocks/assets and their own idilic views of markets/domestic economy.

1615 2018-11-13 10:38:07 Because people will store their wealth one way or another: bidding up non-monetary assets like stocks, real estate, artwork etc. to take the place of depreciating money is a terrible distortion to the economy and makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.

1640 2018-11-13 10:10:03 Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Any money that you believe you will need in the next couple of years (to buy a house or anything) should not be invested in stocks. Pretty simple, but I've talked to too many panicked people in this latest stock market 'downturn'.

1736 2018-11-13 08:47:39 John , while I completely and totally agree with you on the LT prospects of base /EV metals and energy  ( oil /uranium ) stocks, the looming bear market over 2019/20 in Dow /S&P500 will make life difficult for Resource Sector investors, time to play the long patient game now

1976 2018-11-13 05:15:25 Nah not really. 

Regular stocks have more regular (earnings, news, options expiry, fed minutes) events that help drive the cycle. Also better sector rotation — something always ready to be a bull.

1980 2018-11-13 05:10:30 The benefit having growth stocks in Roth IRA outweighs the taxes you would have to pay on dividend stocks in taxable every year. IMO!

1982 2018-11-13 05:09:46 When you say big dividend payers, like REITs then yes they should be in Roth IRA since they will be taxed as ordinary income so you want to avoid them in taxable. But I’m talking about typical 3% div stocks, put them in taxable and pay taxes on them every year at special rate.

1985 2018-11-13 05:06:51 As you grow older, you transition your portfolio in Roth IRA to dividend stocks. When you sell stocks in Roth IRA, they are tax free as long as they are still within your Roth IRA. I know lots of people don’t advocate this strategy but if you think about it, it makes sense.

1991 2018-11-13 05:04:46 When I said growth stocks, I mean high quality companies like Visa and MasterCard. They will have a strong growth in the next decade. I’d put them and all REITs in Roth IRA. The rest of all other high quality dividend stocks in taxable.

1994 2018-11-13 05:03:48 Stocks/real estate have become stores of value. They are not. They are businesses. We are not yet done on this cycle. You sense of time is too short. Wake up smell the coffee. It’s infront of ur face. People who have savedtheir entire lives are being destroyed!
1995 2018-11-13 05:03:13 Yea I know but if you think about it further, the capital gains are often larger from growth stocks than typical 3% dividends. Right? You would save a lot more taxes by putting growth stocks in Roth IRA and dividend stocks in taxable account than vice versa.

1999 2018-11-13 05:00:19 Me really need to invest in some stocks
2000 2018-11-13 04:59:59 True. But most individual investors: a) don't have the funds to invest in hedge funds, and b) almost don't invest/trade like hedge funds do. they just buy-and-hold and they don't short stocks.
2001 2018-11-13 04:59:19 wts....even their yg select no longer has stocks and almost everywhere now too. iKONICS and their buying power 
2002 2018-11-13 04:59:08 I thought QE kept interests rates low, or lowered them, allowing money to be borrowed cheaply to buy stocks and real estate, thus driving those things up, instead of investing in actual business.. it’s financial investments and real estate.. not jobs...

If there is a reason it wont and will move up, then it will be Dow Futures. So watch that today.  Levels, I tweeted earlier.

2098 2018-11-13 03:54:57 You already admitted banning bump stocks does nothign to your gun rights.
When you resist every single regulation, you give the impression you care about guns more than lives. That's bad optics.
2099 2018-11-13 03:54:13 With the Dow dropping 600 points today, should investors be concerned? Is it time to think about selling or should they be putting more money into their stocks? An investment expert helps us navigate this roller coaster market at 10 on @WCCO.

2103 2018-11-13 03:50:59 Personally I'm not phased by the announcement but it's pretty obvious why people are pissed, why stocks have plummeted and the announcement video is mass disliked. This is a case of a developer being out of touch with their demographic. @Grummz too said as much

2116 2018-11-13 03:46:46 400ish gun deaths per year with guns that can take bump stocks. Not even that.

Among those, even if EVERY GUN had a bump stock on it and EVERY one of those was stopped because the stock was banned, that's like 5% of all gun violence.

Superfluous. Nothing.
2117 2018-11-13 03:46:18 Great chart depicting long term vision and execution!  We’re seeing the revolution come together after 10 years of hard work. On the other hand, short-sellers spend all their time nay-saying success, doing nothing. You are just analyzing stocks; not that important! $100 swings
2118 2018-11-13 03:45:54 I think the stock market will turn around and give us another run before the deep dive.  Energy is cheap, interest rates are still low, and it's a seasonally good time for stocks.  If it does turn into a 2008 shit show remember gold sold off only slightly less than stocks.
2119 2018-11-13 03:45:04 @ttmygh These guys are boomers. They have way more money than they will ever know what to do with anyway. All boomers had to do was buy assets- any assets- in the 80's and 90's. Stocks bonds RE even gold. Just close your eyes and buy. And win.
2120 2018-11-13 03:43:33 Even if 3 stocks 8 minutes is the norm, I think I'm gonna try timeouts as a legitimate strategy. I play zoning/campy characters so I should legit play to their strengths

2137 2018-11-13 03:35:29 The bump stock ban was a pointless attack on gun rights that was obviously being used to snowball in the banning of more and more accessories.

2166 2018-11-13 03:19:16 Everyone knows that stocks go up in long run but very few have a high enough allocation to equities though. Risk-aversion is a real psychological property of humans and imo accounts for equity risk premium (as well as smallcap risk premium).

2208 2018-11-13 02:59:44 . There's no single reason stocks are selling off — despite President Trump's unfounded claim to the contrary — although one driver today was Apple shares dropping after one of its key suppliers reported a decrease in order volume.

2211 2018-11-13 02:56:17 You can still do all of that though, in fact I'd expect 90% of the matches to just play out like singles; you're generally incentivized to pick character A for all 3 stocks instead of character A/B/C for one each. It's just an extra option for the few who don't want to do that.

2216 2018-11-13 02:52:18 What an asshat! When stocks go up it's because of him. When they go down it's because of the Dems. Typical Republican response...and it's getting old!

2237 2018-11-13 02:38:02 My tech stocks have been gently & steadily rising for years; some had doubled. Then w/Trump, they skyrocketed by about 30% quickly.

2292 2018-11-13 02:12:26 Wealth preservation is as important as wealth creation.

For example APT on ASX or FANGS in US.

2350 2018-11-13 01:35:18 Hey no worries! I think what's most important is being able to assess what exactly is causing your wrist pain. Are you playing too much? Or are you trying to sextuple shine grab every time your opponent dies in between stocks??
2351 2018-11-13 01:35:05 Issue here is of  2 billion plus who live day to day & don’t know what saving is. Forget bonds, stocks, derivatives et al that we are priveledged to have. Cash is inflationary and creates more inequality. Rich get richer by buying inflationary assets that poor can’t afford.
2352 2018-11-13 01:33:54 Goodmorning! 
I feel Indian traders are getting smarter than others and discount even macro impacts before! 
10480 broken again and  below that 10380-350 is next support! . 
Opportunity are in selective stocks. 
Bankniftyfuture 25500 must watch as crucial support.
Happy trading!
2353 2018-11-13 01:33:53 As far as the stock market scare tactics. Is it within the standard deviation? A 10 percent hit turns it into a BEAR market. A 5 percent hit for savvy investors means find the stocks to buy.

2355 2018-11-13 01:32:36 No, "for each stock" is the default understanding of how the mode worked. "One character for all stocks," as in, not being forced to switch off a character when you die while still allowing your opponent to do so.
2356 2018-11-13 01:32:20 Land should be inflation proof but attracts significant property tax. Cash is not inflation proof. Bonds are not inflation proof. Stocks do well as long as the company can pass on to someone else the Impact of inflation. Gold is pretty unique.

2358 2018-11-13 01:30:48 Betterment. Betterment charges 0.25% Low fees and tax loss harvesting. CFPs are good to set a plan so you can set your budget and savings targets, but they will likely underperform the market picking stocks for you.

2366 2018-11-13 01:27:29 Investors *are* indeed exiting stocks;  they are selling back to the companies who are buying back their shares (for cancellation) with freshly printed money from the Fed...
2367 2018-11-13 01:26:42 A margin loan lets you borrow money to invest and uses your shares as security. If you're looking to borrow money to build your portfolio, check to see whether your brokerage offers margin loans. #Onlinetrading #stocks #InvestSmart #tradegoose

2418 2018-11-13 00:52:01 To make money with stocks it is only a matter of buying furiously when stock prices are falling and everyone is panicking. Stocks are generally profitable if they go against the people. After all it is precious thing that matters.

What else will kick in because of his Presidency. Lower employment and worse economy. Trump I dear you try to lead us out of a recession..
2423 2018-11-13 00:48:23 Implications for the main market if that’s the case.  Looking at housing stocks, and terrible housing demand, not sure I can make a case for it to jump on ER.

2430 2018-11-13 00:46:01 I panicked the night Trump was elected, I was about to sell all stocks, but I didn’t.  Since then the market has continued to go up (the last 3 years of Obama were great). That being said, I'd trade it all to restore decency and truth to the White House.

2459 2018-11-13 00:31:16 I think it's important to consider how many Boomers put their faith in Real Estate as so many took a bath in stocks in 2000-2002 when they were younger, they held on through the first housing bubble, but now at exactly retirement age.  Cashing out of everything right about NOW.

2464 2018-11-13 00:30:07 Stocks go up under President Barack Obama, and continue up while Obama budgets are still in force.  trump takes the credit.

Trade war, high cost of raw materials, enormous deficits and enormous debts caused by trump make stocks go down.  trump blames the democrats.

2468 2018-11-13 00:29:36 The tax cut made no difference to our income. Higher gas prices and that of other goods did. And the continued fall of stocks doesn’t help my ira either

2470 2018-11-13 00:28:40 But if the French are not allowed to fish our waters so where will they get their fish from,No other EU country that’s for sure,I do think we could do a deal with Portugal, Spain, Italy, as they have massive stocks of Fruit veg and wine + we have Fish and tourists+ to sell 
2471 2018-11-13 00:26:16 USA mj stocks are the obvious place to be now vs Canada.
2472 2018-11-13 00:26:13 While the data looks ok for $VKTX price action to news is horrible so far. Not saying it can’t change but maybe people are just saying biotech stocks don’t command these giant moves anymore.
2473 2018-11-13 00:25:11 You know James Sinegal, the one who's stocks did better than Sam's wholesale on the Dow Jones. You know that guy Barack Obama supported? Which is a whole lot different than someone who donates to a campaign.
2474 2018-11-13 00:24:44 That is wonderful news, because Democrats know how to Short stocks and make money.
2475 2018-11-13 00:24:26 We check Melon chart is like us checking stocks lol
2476 2018-11-13 00:24:23 J'ai ajouté une vidéo à une playlist @YouTube - Swiss Central Bank SOLD Billions of U.S. Stocks RIGHT BEFORE the October Stock
2477 2018-11-13 00:24:13 Stocks are tanking hard because of low investor confidence! Just the thought of unstable and bird brain Maxine Waters as head of the Finance committee is enough to scare investors! Then there’s Pelosi, Schumer, Schiff! So Bizarre!  -> low IQ @RepMaxineWaters
2478 2018-11-13 00:23:52 Il dépend aussi de l'état des stocks, de la variation de la demande, de la spéculation et même de la météo. Enfin, le PLUS IMPORTANT, les ACCISES et la TVA.
2479 2018-11-13 00:23:15 U.S. stocks closes far lower Monday,11/12/18: $DJIA -2.32% (-602.1) at 25,387.18, $SPX -1.97% (-54.7) at 2,726.22, $COMPQ -2.78% (-206.0) at 7,200.87.
2480 2018-11-13 00:22:57 Talk to your financial advisers.
Stop making up stuff.

Stocks rebounded in the middle of the year but have swooned again because investors are worried about rising rates -— and a mountain of debt caused by the tax cut bill that higher rates will make more expensive to pay off.
2481 2018-11-13 00:22:29 Neil - my point is if a major correction does happen I believe that uranium stocks may have a better downside risk - yes they will drop but not as hard as other stocks in general - that is my opinion. I may be wrong but I believe they may not have as much downside. opinion vary
2482 2018-11-13 00:21:38 Stocks falling?  Time to step some micro transactions!!!
2483 2018-11-13 00:21:21 Two big stocks:  $AAPL, $GS typically heavyweight leaders in their sector=NOT looking good!  #Cashisaposition
2484 2018-11-13 00:20:13 That appears to be the gain in market value of his existing holdings.  Scott has large holdings due to his earlier careers in Healthcare and in Investment.  Net worth published figures go up and down based upon the market prices of the stocks.  Can U cite this stuff about spouse?
2485 2018-11-13 00:19:15 Sources for your claim that Trump is conducting an organized stock manipulation operation via twitter? Or is that just an assumption based on the fact that stocks react to his tweets? If so, why not assume that Obama did the same, since stocks reacted to his decisions too?
2486 2018-11-13 00:18:38 Whether we're talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it is marked down. - Warren Buffett
2487 2018-11-13 00:18:35 Don't play the penny stocks.
2488 2018-11-13 00:17:46 5 stocks 1 min fs meter on hazards off stage morph between delfino and halberd
2489 2018-11-13 00:17:38 Had to cut some words up there to fit it but haha, totally got the idea that that would happen, from all the stuff you've taught me. Everyone in Canada thought weed stocks would soar after legalization. I said no way thats happening , look at HMMJ holdings after oct16 lol
2490 2018-11-13 00:16:52 You're always going to have investors who prefer precious metals to stocks, bonds, currencies, etc...ideology or not.
2491 2018-11-13 00:16:46 Hey so, weed got legalized in Canada, m'dad was telling me to buy weed stocks, I said that the stock prices on weed companies would actually drop after legalization bcuz every1 expects them to go up, he dnt BLv me. Literally the day before Lglzation, prices dropped fr 2 wks str8
2492 2018-11-13 00:16:40 Down 600 points today Donnie!
Thanks to YOU!

2493 2018-11-13 00:16:35 The FED will not end QT until buying Gold is going to be normal result for what the economic environment would be . Don't worry about stocks when Ditched USD start to come back to USA causing hyper-inflation the stocks going to rally again.
2494 2018-11-13 00:16:03 Seriously man! 

Missing the 25% plus spikes  even in cannabis sounding related stocks whose namesake was speculated to get any mention of any type of license on Health Canada website after hours.

Ahh...good old pre reality aka speculation days.
2495 2018-11-13 00:15:45 Hungry, and in need of a meaty umami hit that the mostly vegetarian food stocks of Toxic Towers are in no position to allay. *eyes @fatwans’ cat food sachets*
2496 2018-11-13 00:15:20 I don't want to look at my stocks 
2497 2018-11-13 00:15:18 No, people like Garage and Rees-Mogg! Rich b******s who deal in currencies and stocks and shares and only care about making their personal offshore bank balances even bigger.
2498 2018-11-13 00:14:01 Yes, the #StockMarket was down again today,but the golden rule of #investing is if your goals haven't changed, don't change ur portfolio. BTW, a #fixedincome approach to 30 yrs of rising costs (#inflation) is suicide #AssetAllocation #FinancialPlanning #LongTermInvesting #stocks
2499 2018-11-13 00:13:11 Diana the material mover is checking/trading/buying/selling stocks but is abducted and probed by Martha Stewart.
2500 2018-11-13 00:12:58 In a year, the stock price of this company shot up by a whopping 1122%

PLEASE HELP US TO FIND MORE STOCKS OF THESE KIND discuss it on your channels many of us languishing will benefit
2501 2018-11-13 00:11:30 Problem with cash outperforming assets is on balance no one is rewarded for buying stocks they believe will succeed. This is a distortion and can lead to savings glut as we have seen in Japan. Another point I would add is the spectre of deflation from population bomb.
2502 2018-11-13 00:11:29 CNBC: Australian shares fall after Dow tumbles overnight

CNBC: Australia shares fell in early trade, with almost all the sectors in negative territory. Energy stocks fell by 1.45 percent while the heavily weighted financial subindex saw losses of 1.88 percent....

2503 2018-11-13 00:11:25 Was welcoming change. Are stocks having maintenance or the stocks that leaving are starting to leave?
2504 2018-11-13 00:11:05 Absolutely.  And they have run their course.  We are due for a huge correction.  We sold all our tech stocks in September.
2505 2018-11-13 00:10:29 Doesn't Melee have 8 minutes but it also has 4 stocks? Wouldn't it make more sense to encourage defensive play/timeouts if the time limit wasn't that high? 
That would make it an overall option to be considered, not just by campy people.
2506 2018-11-13 00:10:15 Hope you lobby cllrs, TDs and Senators to ensure that every library stocks a copy.  Don't forget university and garda libraries.
2507 2018-11-13 00:10:04 Today's mid-day Media roundtable was the first time in quite awhile i heard some real confusion & disgruntlement about "why" stocks were selling off & a reluctance to say "BUY"  I view this as a necessary part of the sentiment equation that had been sorely missing in recent weeks

2511 2018-11-13 00:08:12 he said "in this particular setting" aka a setting like stocks and time. we've already seen the hazzards toggle is in the rules menu in a layer build, there's no specific stage toggle, just a blanket rule for all matches and stages
2512 2018-11-13 00:07:58 Trump said he was going to ban bump stocks last year after the Vegas shooting. Here we are a year later and nothing has been done.
2513 2018-11-13 00:07:29 U.S. stocks closes far lower Monday,11/12/18: $DJIA -2.32% at 25,387.18, $SPX -1.97% at 2,726.22, $COMPQ -2.78% at 7,200.87, $RUT -1.98% at $1518.79.
2514 2018-11-13 00:07:26 If it’s 3 stocks why would anyone advocate for anything less than 7 minutes?
2515 2018-11-13 00:07:23 When Trump was elected, I sold all stocks and mutual funds. I did not trust where he would take us. 
It was a mistake financially. Stocks went up, I lost income from dividends. HOWEVER, I slept better, knowing he had no control over my finances. He is too unstable to trust.
2516 2018-11-13 00:07:10 I know @CNBC won't admit it but the US Senate seats being stolen in #Arizona & #Florida pushed a major selloff in #stocks today. The market, investors & #economy does NOT want higher #taxes. Libs are also trying to steal the #Senate. Uncertainty is kryptonite for #markets. #kag
2517 2018-11-13 00:06:41 Nope.  In fact, groceries cost more now, and my insurance premiums went up.  My taxes are the same.  No difference.  At least not enough to buy stocks (or a yacht) with.
2518 2018-11-13 00:06:31 *stocks up on antacids and anti-hangover food and drinks az a weak and aging person*
2519 2018-11-13 00:06:13 Gasoline, groceries, and health care... They are all costing me more. I have some stocks and mutual funds, they are all down since he took office. Companies might be doing well, but I'm not a company.
2520 2018-11-13 00:05:59 the TRIN, or Arms index has finally started to show some evidence of more volume into declining stocks- While not yet at capitulatory levels, today's 1.76 was the highest reading since mid-August - @Newtonadvisors
2521 2018-11-13 00:05:04 Sounds right!  $NYSE was lower & that's the entire exchange of NY stocks.  Go with that!  :)  Very poor price action anyway you slice it!  :)
2522 2018-11-13 00:04:11 It’s a business meeting about company stocks and stuff
2523 2018-11-13 00:03:02 Founding fathers would put them in stocks in the square. Or either tar & feather the 1st time. After that, they would hang the bastards.
2524 2018-11-13 00:02:25 1) personally yes
2) professionally only indirectly
Question: are there any other data types where excel can kind of normalize fuzzy values, besides stocks?
2525 2018-11-13 00:02:01 Twitter, facebook and Google can track all of this fairly easily by behavior. They make guesses but with enough data they can be fairly accurate. Why would someone earning low wage Google stuff about stocks, for example.
2526 2018-11-13 00:01:55 Buy gold & gold stocks now to safeguard your money before the coming recession. This crash will be worse than 2008. Get your money out of real estate now. Get your banked money swapped before currencies drop lower. Cryptos are not safe. Do not listen to MSM about economic future.
2527 2018-11-13 00:01:54 I'm super sad that the Smash community is pretty much guaranteed to go 3 stocks instead of 2 for Ultimate. Long sets are alright for majors but dear god I don't want to depend on low turnout and other people for setups so I can go home at a normal time from running weeklies.
