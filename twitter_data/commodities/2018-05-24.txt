36 2018-05-24 22:14:31 wonder how self employees or daily wages employees can carry it on.. when all of a sudden commuters & buyers stop using their commodities or services
37 2018-05-24 22:11:47 I'll check it out, but it's not a surprise that the oil is one of the most manipulated commodities there.

39 2018-05-24 22:08:57 That's why Saddam and Gaddafi were wiped out. Saddam wanted to start oil trade in other currencies and commodities.

40 2018-05-24 22:08:30 Não terá intervenção do Estado na flutuação da moeda! Não tem como mexer.  Ocorre que, como as exportações de commodities serão taxadas, elas diminuirão e entrarão menos dólares pra financiar o déficit comercial. Haverá uma depreciação natural do Real.

i s2g i hate men and men for the most part are trash lol. i dont want that life
52 2018-05-24 21:16:29 Se ve que los privados no les interesaba producir antes del FA porque el PBI era la cinco veces menos que ahora. Y los precios de los commodities solo explican una pequeña parte. No te olvides que las exportaciones son el 15% del PBI, y de eso un 40% corresponden al agro.

60 2018-05-24 20:38:50 Apenas uma ressalva, intervenção nos preços dos combustíveis trouxe inúmeros problemas para Petrobras, por se tratarem de commodities devem ser regulados por mercado. O problema é que pagamos mais de 50% de impostos no preço final, A diminuição dos impostos é a solução.
61 2018-05-24 20:30:22 During MMS time inflation rate was 10% now it's 4% that means people are getting necessary commodities in lesser price now rather than MMS time. So the spending capacity of the people of present time is much more than MMS time, MMS gifted deficit economy
62 2018-05-24 20:29:40 Forex and Commodities have a different price step than index or stocks!!!
63 2018-05-24 20:19:56 Yes they can do. But that’s not good for the currencies of those countries with lower rates, as people would sell the £ for the $ to buy US bonds for example, thus crashing the £ and causing inflation in any goods (eg oil/gas/gold/food and most commodities) prices in $

73 2018-05-24 19:55:30 Generally remote from main theatre, therefore 'consultant only' lists. ERCP with propofol 'monitored anaesthetic care' can be akin to a GA, in a prone patient, with commodities, in a remote site with a shared (non intubated) airway.
74 2018-05-24 19:49:50 The whole problem with your analogy is the assumption that people (men) are entitled to sex. Nobody is. You have to work to make yourself a desirable sexual partner. Vaginas are not commodities or a birthright as they have human beings attached to them.

79 2018-05-24 19:40:14 Maybe the banks want a puppet state and no doubt they will demand a central bank, US Embassy and possibly a US base. The US are aware of the threat of China - China is going to be the new super power. Perhaps North Korea have commodities that the US are interested in?

96 2018-05-24 18:34:22 Você defende o modelo Dilma-Mantega que quebrou a empresa né? Mantega ligava para a presidente da Petrobrás e definia o preço dos combustíveis. Toda empresa repassa os custos de produção quando os seus insumos são atrelados ao dólar e commodities. Por que a @petrobras não pode?

115 2018-05-24 17:49:51 Securing our ports are more important. More contraband and illegal commodities are imported via shipping containers than across the border. Support DACA and support Port Security and i will be onboard. Enough with the divisive immigration rhetoric and lets tackle actual security
116 2018-05-24 17:41:57 Pricing power has always been the most precious of commodities increasingly it's the preserve of a few luxury brands  high end electronics and coffee shops .....

119 2018-05-24 17:33:26 @sudhirchaudhary y don't we hv a reality check on effect of rising fuel prices on essential commodities. Vegetables prices r at lowest rates n so r other foodgrains bt no debate around it.

122 2018-05-24 17:21:21 What the fuck are these men made of? In this culture women girls babies are objectified commodities in society ruled by religious beliefs more so than west In west at least there's  court to revert to What happens here?

1. lowered home loan interest rates?
2. Lower prices of commodities thanks to GST?
3. No corruption/scams since 4 years?
4. Large NPA accounts returning money to banks?
5. Transparency in work due to digital tracking?

At least 5 ke jawab de do...
124 2018-05-24 17:17:35 Hides it under his mattress? Invests in commodities. Perhaps I should stop trying to give people the benefit of the doubt because shit that’s messed up.
125 2018-05-24 17:15:25 The Chinese are bluffing, its not like there is a huge surplus of commodities to replace American food supplies. The Russians barely produce enough wheat to supply themselves, short term they can meet quotas, but eventually they will have to buy from us.
126 2018-05-24 17:15:19 “Achche Din” to come we need more money. So the govt is looting it from Common Man. Fuel price increase will take care of cost increase in all other commodities. I understand 660 million liters of Petrol alone sold/day. Excise per litre is Rs. 19.48. Imagine!

130 2018-05-24 17:05:08 Quando o assunto é utilização de commodities como ferramenta de equilíbrio fiscal cai-se no cerne da questão: quais são as diretrizes orçamentárias de um governo?
Vai daí que deixar o mercado (via Pedro Parente) pautar o preço do Petróleo significa que o governo topa este modelo,
131 2018-05-24 17:00:55 If we don't have essential commodities how will good health happen. Any answer madam
132 2018-05-24 16:55:13 Your inflation fears sound like someone trying to sell gold. The Fed has consistently missed inflation targets. Efficiency and automation have always had *deflationary* effects on the price of commodities in the long run. 

You're creating strawman arguments to bolster your side.
133 2018-05-24 16:51:10 @narendramodi Sir please reduce petrol rates this toral daily commodities
134 2018-05-24 16:45:06 Beats are like commodities, when you dont have any you miss them
135 2018-05-24 16:43:30 1. Los que almacenan commodities van a empezar a vender para evitar más retenciones.
2. Baja el dolar.
3. El gobierno compra dolar más barato.
4. El gobierno baja tasa de lebacs y sube el dolar.
5. El campo vendió barato y el que compro dolar gana.
136 2018-05-24 16:42:54 possible purchases of other corporations. Hercules, Inc., had a Paper Technology Division (PTD) whose products were slowly becoming commodities. In order to survive, this division needed to obtain new products
137 2018-05-24 16:42:25 Great token sale. Fantastic opportunity. 
The Odeep Token is backed by one of the most demanded commodities on the planet : high quality drinking water.

Given the planet's water problem, ODEEP token is on track to become tomorrow's blue gold on the exchange markets!
138 2018-05-24 16:39:38 Most thought a rally in the dollar would crush commodities across the board, but they've held up really well over the last month or so. Especially precious metals.
139 2018-05-24 16:35:16 Any member of the entertainment industry (in any capacity) who acts shocked over news of ppl within their industry being treated like sexual commodities looks foolish and insincere. NEWSFLASH: Normal ppl have assumed you are all depraved perverts who lack a moral compass.
140 2018-05-24 16:33:52 #JH minimum wage saga show that  we dont have intelligent people in our government..........d solution to minimum wage is not increment but government should find away 2 control commodities and infrastructures.............that is it way to solve this problem.
141 2018-05-24 16:32:55 Dear Rahul Gandhi, should you win the mandate of the people and come into power in 2019, I hope you will at least put the fuel under GST. Once this is done all prices of other basic commodities will surely fall and it will make life better for all of us.
142 2018-05-24 16:24:52 What a disgusting remark.  It is shockingly misogynistic.  Money and food are commodities.  Women are not commodities.  Slaves are not commodities.  You have no right to access to someone else's body.  You have no right to sex and there is no injustice in not having it.
143 2018-05-24 16:23:34 Eu gostaria muito de acreditar que essa greve dos caminhoneiros é do povo mas a cada relato me parece muito mais manobra política para redução das commodities da petrobras
144 2018-05-24 16:23:10 @narendramodi @Swamy39 @BJP4Keralam @BJP4India All of you are enjoying royal luxurious life with tax payers money,you enjoy dinner with your counterparts common BJP workers waiting hoping that  the commodities prices and fuel prices will come down... betraying us
145 2018-05-24 16:22:06 :( Majority of the money was made in stocks identifying moats and holding for the long term no? (Ignoring funds dealing with currencies, commodities and speculation profits)
146 2018-05-24 16:18:48 Why the fuck music gotta be so commodified? We talking about ART my nigga. ART. Does nobody have real passion for this shit anymore? It’s all just mass produced commodities now.
147 2018-05-24 16:13:58 Yes, turning humans into commodities doesn't help us. And while we are all connected we are also unique and imho as long as we recognizes both of these everyone gains.
148 2018-05-24 16:02:47 @narendramodi sir please try to reduce the price of petrol and diesel.Otherwise price of essential commodities would not be controlled.Which will affect coming parliamentary elections
149 2018-05-24 16:01:40 Where was Farhan in Cong regime?Why didn’t complain about huge hike in prices of commodities before?Idiots too hv become wiser to crib unnecessarily!
150 2018-05-24 15:59:03 O curso de economia deixa as pessoas melancólicas: toda vez que eu me lembro da minha adolescência durante o boom de commodities eu lembro da frase do bom e velho Samuelson, "A growing nation is the greatest ponzi game ever contrived."

154 2018-05-24 15:45:24 That’s what happens when animals are treated like commodities in factory farms, not sentient beings, allowed to run free.
155 2018-05-24 15:43:28 I have always thought it quite odd that we tell consumers the cost price in this way. Many private buyers - I’m thinking via The Wine Society, BBR and the like - are surely just wanting to buy good wine at a good price, not necessarily buying commodities/investments, like gold.
156 2018-05-24 15:40:27 Let’s hope we stop targeting small pact French wingers and target proven commodities that fill positions of need.
157 2018-05-24 15:37:18 The prices of goods & services, and essential commodities, bus fares, etc once gone up never come down. They either stabilize there, to rise again when another hike in fuel prices takes place. Common man's spine gets broken.

161 2018-05-24 15:30:08 Our Economy looks bigger because we have an over inflated market aND WORSE We have printed so much money with virtually  nothing to back it up except the 'petrodollar'.
And when countries refuse to use our $$ to buy n sell commodities like oil, it will collapse.
162 2018-05-24 15:29:18 Amnesty International'd lecture themselves first against their partisan attitude. We, d Hindus, r not disposable commodities to b used for d benefits of others, n then b treated as untouchable. When'll d Hindus unite against this deep conspiracy backed by d Am his n Jaichandras?
163 2018-05-24 15:28:29 El problema es que solo la exportacion de commodities es la rentable, si te dedicas a exportar bienes transformados no eres competitivo por varios aspectos.
164 2018-05-24 15:28:19 A logística no Brasil sofre há décadas com o gargalo no escoamento das 'commodities' e esse problema está na precariedade da malha ferroviária e nas estradas mal conservadas. Quando a União detém 16% da tributação dos combustíveis vê-se que o #Diesel é a prioridade. :(

167 2018-05-24 15:25:42 Thank you for flagging! Great paper. NCD community can leverage parallels with divesting from other unhealthy commodities like #tobacco and #alcohol and combat #CDOH.
168 2018-05-24 15:24:29 Agree madam . During UPA middle class saved India . I feel the prices of essential commodities are under check . Inflation is around 4% . The government has taken note of the situation regarding oil prices and I am positive of solution . I am also a middle class person .
169 2018-05-24 15:24:20 Gold, the real thing, can only go from, say, $800 to, say $6,000 in a relatively brief period via a reval. Any other path would involve face peeling inflation that would see all commodities rise commensurately and you might as well be long copper, silver, etc
170 2018-05-24 15:17:16 The heat has only begun....now the prices of all commodities will begin rising...
171 2018-05-24 15:12:17 Once tomatoes were Rs150+/KG and now r available on RS20/KG. 
The huge variations in prices of basic food commodities show tht there is no proper food processing/preservation mechanism/structure in Pak.
172 2018-05-24 15:07:26 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
173 2018-05-24 15:03:53 BSE has entered into an agreement with Brink's India for supporting its launch of bullion commodities trading @timesofindia
174 2018-05-24 15:01:33 Rare commodities are worth more than good
175 2018-05-24 14:59:44 That’s a problem, bc what they’ve done with this new rule essentially tells NFL players, they are not their own person, they’re human commodities, they’re owned. They don’t have freedom, only what is allowed. So the paycheck being more important tells me they’re content property
176 2018-05-24 14:55:44 That title wouldn’t fly. Kind of like the “Hollywood Movie Industry Exemption Act” wouldn’t have gotten out of first gear - but they got exempt anyway! I enjoy movies but I think Ag commodities (livestock and crops) are more perishable and important than movie sets.
177 2018-05-24 14:55:20 Anyone know who this Amir Adnani is who is continually asked by media outlets to pontificate on metals and commodities?? He comes across as full of  to me and likes to hear his own voice! Has he ever made anyone any money?? 
178 2018-05-24 14:54:48 QUEM TEM O CONTROLE DAS ESTRADAS TEM O CONTROLE DO PAÍS, POIS TUDO ESTÁ ATRELADO A INSUMOS E COMMODITIES
179 2018-05-24 14:54:47 The only time I'll truly have faith in our government is when basic essential commodities stop being so ridiculously expensive. And when issues such as women safety, minority safety are taken seriously. Infrastructure is taken seriously.
180 2018-05-24 14:52:21 @Swamy39 @republic @TimesNow @PMOIndia have u seen any countries fighting against price hikes for daily usage commodities?education is free,hospital treatments r free,reservations for all minorities,schedules & obc.& Everyone want their rights.but none ready to spend for r nation
181 2018-05-24 14:52:19 50-50 Not Bad.....every chance now on wards our PM will turn around the table with his flamboyance speeches ,  social medias & other recovery agents...hidden or covered...& more over commodities will be cheaper now on wards including Petrol & Diesel

183 2018-05-24 14:50:25 @toralkavi ... why only talk about petrol-diesel prices... when prices of daily needed commodities have come down drastically!? Where was Rahul Gandhi n Congress when Onions n Vegetable Prices sky rocketed during their reign?
184 2018-05-24 14:49:54 For this you need knowledge in depth Can’t Make Childish comments Go to RTI and check rates of commodities What is the rate of Crude now? Don’t spread faltu rumours It seems for you Swamy is the better friend
185 2018-05-24 14:46:32 Omg this is more than crazy. Yet same people cry foul if lack of money and rush to increase the price of oil and other commodities. Sick state I see
186 2018-05-24 14:41:04 Yes. I am always suspicious of these busts simply being hostile takeovers of turf and human commodities. I want evidence of the victims being saved, not just the criminals being punished.
187 2018-05-24 14:32:02 Amiga, o problema vem de longe, muito longe. Apesar de eu não eximir o governo atual e o preço dos combustíveis, existe todo um contexto econômico aí. Economia não se manobra como um carrinho de supermercado. Os caras trabalham com muitas variáveis, inclusive commodities
188 2018-05-24 14:30:53 Government should first concentrate on lowering the prices of essential commodities. The poor people can live with ease. Why the government is raising the prices is out of reach of a common man. Every items rate depends on fuel prices. We oppose price rise.
189 2018-05-24 14:29:27 We stop borrowing and establish our own currency backed by 1 of our commodities since we have failed on the fiat side.  Without our own currency there is nothing our govt can do for our people

Thats where the money is and has always been.
191 2018-05-24 14:28:31 Except China itself said that the anti-dumping investigation on grain sorghum had nothing to do with the trade spat. It predated it and was something it has frequently done against U.S. ag commodities. It actually lifted it as a product of the negotiations though.
192 2018-05-24 14:27:28 Fuel price hike : Fuel are an imported commodities for India. Provides fuel card and connect with the vehicle. List the personal, service and commercial vehicles. Provides subsidising for the commercial vehicles in retail. Plan to exchange the commodities with oil rich nation.
193 2018-05-24 14:24:05 Reports out today highlight that the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are working with the US Justice Department to run an investigation into Bitcoin price manipulation that could be influencing the state of the markets as we see it today. According to Bloomberg.
194 2018-05-24 14:20:03 Fuel price hike has a tendency to push prices of all essential commodities upward. The current Govt. is insensitive and unconcerned about people’s hardship.
195 2018-05-24 14:12:49 @rith_mic, I am a precious metals Commodities broker. Myself & my companies have to be informed on current events & politics at all times because they affect precious metals prices. I'd test my knowledge of politics against yours any day of the week. It's you that's ill-informed
196 2018-05-24 14:11:44 IT IS HIGHLY REGRETTING THAT ALL TV CHANNELS IN MY COUNTRY ARE DISCUSSING PHYSICAL FITNESS, THROWING THE SUSTENANCE-RELATED URGENT ISSUES LIKE RISE IN THE PRICES OF ESSENTIAL COMMODITIES, INCLUDING PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, OUT OF THEIR STUDIO'S WINDOWS.
197 2018-05-24 14:11:12 Parte do plano golpista. Brasil exporta commodities e importa produtos industrializados com serviços agregados. O retorno de Parente das catacumbas tucanas foi para isso.
198 2018-05-24 14:09:24 @DavidPerezReyna acaba de postear sobre lo mismo, mencionando el caso particular de Colombia que tiene superávits de commodities y deficits de manufacturas pero baja volatilidad macro. ¿Cómo explicarlo? @dgomezco y David, ¿se conocen? Saludos!
199 2018-05-24 14:08:13 They are on a fitness spree now when people are becoming unfit for paying a heavy tax on petrol and Diesel . Simultaneously the price of the other commodities will go up on it's impact.

203 2018-05-24 14:00:17 Cattle, along with all commodities, have a firm outlook on trade possibilities. China imported 73,727 tons of beef in April from the U.S.  Up 32% vs a year ago. #cattle #agexports
204 2018-05-24 14:00:01 Commodities: Baltic Dry -4.56%, Rice -3.48%
205 2018-05-24 13:56:31 They are now doing their best to divert public attention. But other commodities price will go up with the rise in price of petrol and diesel. Now money is flowing as tax to the coffers why they will bother now !

210 2018-05-24 13:47:07 Só pra apontar UM erro nesse fluxograma "lindo". Mullah pagou a dívida com o FMI com juros baixíssimos e para isso teve de contratar outra, pagando juros bem mais altos. De resto muitas falácias. Mullah surfou na onda dos preços altos das commodities e endividou o país.
211 2018-05-24 13:46:17 What a terrific piece! Worth bookmarking for tons of future reading. And this: “Online rating systems have made otherwise smart people view books as commodities. .. [W/books intended as art], a reader does at least half of any book’s heavy lifting.”
212 2018-05-24 13:44:48 Isso é 100% relativo. O dólar é em função da inflação e da situação econômica do país. O Brasil estabilizando, o valor do dólar também abaixa, consequentemente as commodities. Outro detalhe: o barril não tem valor volátil como divulgam.
213 2018-05-24 13:44:29 2 - All their players are treated like commodities and that’s it. They have no respect for them. If hey did care they would have comprehensive concussion protocol instead of the embarrassingly inadequate process they have now. The only thing they care about is $$$
214 2018-05-24 13:40:01 He means attacks that kill people, like men, not commodities, like women.

221 2018-05-24 13:26:05 Why would they? They make money off the black athletes. They are employees, commodities, nothing more. The NFL is just like every other piece of shit, racist organization out there.
222 2018-05-24 13:25:51 It will surely increase prices of other commodities, Transport unions have increased fare charges by 5-10% sooner the prices of basic commodities will increase.
223 2018-05-24 13:24:49 Not likely to get one, now. But as a future product line, this has potential, IMO. Chevy & Ford turned engines & gearboxes into commodities. No reason EVs (smaller, less complicated) can undergo the same.
224 2018-05-24 13:20:40 That must be the "commodities king"

In 1996, @nytimes columnist Bill Safire called Hillary a “congenital liar” & pronounced her statements about commodities trading, firing of WH travel staff & Vince Foster’s suicide “utterly implausible.” Although “unfounded,” his charges stuck.

266 2018-05-24 10:57:27 I understand your point. But I don’t think you’ll be amazed if the labor shortage problem persists while commodities break out and continue to lead. What amazes me is the widely held misconception that the fed alone is responsible for bringing forward the next recession.

272 2018-05-24 10:34:32 Essential commodities shouldn't be taxed on percentage under multiple heads. One tax, simple govt tax fixed amount  limited to 10~15%. Eg: 10/- per lit at least tax blow would be limited and not impact changes.

280 2018-05-24 09:57:26 So yesterday I asked group chat a totally harmless question about wizard monetary policy and let me tell you, fights about the gold standard and commodities are a lot more intense when it’s in the context of a system there there’s a legitimate argument that there’s no scarcity.
281 2018-05-24 09:52:41 But Petrol and diesel price has a bearing on prices of all commodities
282 2018-05-24 09:50:52 There is great increase in unemployment, increase in food commodities, increase in electricity tariffs, violence increasing, selection of one tribe in key positions, appointing dead brains in this government without vision, nothing is working....

284 2018-05-24 09:39:09 Which government wants to provide services &  commodities on high rates. There will be some reasons which we are not aware of. At least this government is not taking all the money in scams. At least they are providing some services to the poor which were not provided earlier.
285 2018-05-24 09:31:06 see the other side of economy where prices of commodities are under control
286 2018-05-24 09:26:05 Maybe the problem is a society that treats women as commodities instead of as people
287 2018-05-24 09:24:38 You're claiming that it's increased by 10-15%. Isn't that your responsibility to back your claims with facts (i.e. bills and prices) instead of asking others to prove otherwise?
Please share the actual prices of commodities over the period of last 4 years, then we will discuss
288 2018-05-24 09:23:48 Well Mr. Gandhi I strongly believe that the health of citizens of a country is of greater importance than the price of commodities and before blaming @BJP4India government just give a glance at @INCIndia's tenure. Anyways it would be hard for you to understand.

310 2018-05-24 07:44:21 @dpradhanbjp @narendramodi @arunjaitley @PiyushGoyal Suggestion to control fuel price - taxes applied on these commodities should be on volume basis and not on cost basis.
 Govt should fix tax say rd 20/lit irrespective of cost of fuel per litre. This would reduce spiral effect.

330 2018-05-24 06:53:47 How to beat fuel price hike

whereever available
3.Use Bike instead car being cheaper 
4.Use Bicycles for small distances 
Petrol @Rs100 shortly other commodities will bcum expensive
331 2018-05-24 06:53:20 & why do they insist that effect to the price increase of commodities is minimial (as in in cents only)?San b sila namamalengke o grocery?Masyado silang detached from reality o wala lang yung presyo ng bilihin ksi sagana sila sa panggastos galing sa buwis natin?

333 2018-05-24 06:49:35 You need to read again what I first replied to you. And also evaluate who is turning whom into commodities, and who is not. Anyway what is this timepass diversion for a years old tweet?

335 2018-05-24 06:43:07 You cannot relate increasing cost of fuel with pollution.Increase in its prices will impact the prices of daily needs commodities too
336 2018-05-24 06:42:52 That's fine. But since he talked like a commodity capture, I proposed one too, which is an actual commodity capture and saves people captured as commodities.
337 2018-05-24 06:42:41 She spoke truth, she requested to supply commodities to NYS , vouchers were filled up. She should return the money and be set free. The officer who wired money to her account is the main actor behind the scenes and @DCI_Kenya should concentrate on him/her.

338 2018-05-24 06:39:48 Thing is, I've wanted Wall St to collapse, to save the world from the predators that steal national wealth, speculate on commodities, cause famines, massacre peoples. It has collapsed, in fact, but was "bailed out". It is a monster. But TNCs have no borders.  Root of the problem.

347 2018-05-24 05:47:53 Sir, so by saying this you are supporting fuel hike?? With fuel hike all necessary commodities price will be increased too.. is this what you want to gift people of India?
348 2018-05-24 05:46:11 whoah whoah whoah Brazil has halted 129 chicken, pork and beef plants because of a truckers strike, expected to climb to 208 as of Friday, ABPA says .... that's more than 90% of Brazilian meat output!!! #commodities #meat #poultry @business Also strike kicking off in Argentina ..
349 2018-05-24 05:45:24 Its not all about demand of commodities... Are you trying to say that is all those developed country there is no such demand of commodities as in Zim NO WAY.. This is caused by poor management and channeling of resources to where they are not profitable or bring revenue to Zim

351 2018-05-24 05:23:19 As per direction of Deputy Commissioner Battagram, Assistant Commissioner Allai paid surprise raid to Kandow Bazar, checked all essential commodities and the violators were booked under the relevant law.
352 2018-05-24 05:12:06 State revenue,collected from citizens,ultimately is meant for welfare of the society However when levy of high taxes on commodities by state leaves the citizens hand to mouth & unsettle the financial health of society,the entire purpose of taxation is defeated. #FuelPrices 1/2
353 2018-05-24 05:12:06 How do this country survive without taxing the communities' salary and commodities? How?!
354 2018-05-24 05:10:00 Prices of oil commodities can be brought down but the deficit will appear in some other form wherever this tax/cess/commision money is being used. It is a like a leaking boat with only few stoppers. Thats why green energy is the only saving grace in the long run.
355 2018-05-24 05:07:15 I think his point is that it’s a silly concept as commodities don’t trade themselves. Their value is social, not something they hold within themselves
356 2018-05-24 05:05:45 The prices of commodities have fallen at appreciable price, you didnt mention those, why? Do you also belong to Anti Modi Group?
357 2018-05-24 05:05:24 I would love to see players wearing tees that state "We the People....Commodities of the Ownership Class" on one side, and a helpful list of what to do when your constitutional rights are violated on the other. Then have the players auction the tees off for SPLC or Kaps charity.
358 2018-05-24 05:04:49 Its not crying over petrol......rise in petrol price will gradually lead to increase is price of other commodities too

Fuel price keeps on increasing. Strangely people react with amusement and say it should touch century.
States, Center tug of war continues. Cost of essential commodities on the rise.
Time not far off when the amusement explode to an uncontrollable anger.

366 2018-05-24 04:24:37 @cnbcSri @GeoffCutmore @_HadleyGamble Goodmorning Thanks for your show and interview! as we see the focus of risk is now more on emerging markets and Europe rather than US economy !esp. currencies and commodities !
367 2018-05-24 04:22:37 A strong resentment is brewing up among the general public against the Modi Govt failure to control the prices of petrol and diesel which have gone all time high with d continuous hike for the last ten consecutive days. The hike is going to affect all commodities, say the people.
368 2018-05-24 04:20:21 In order to reach at multiplex, you have to pay for the fuel (until you decide to go for a walk). Also, increment in fuel directly impacts the price of commodities !
369 2018-05-24 04:10:47 How Can government allow open firing on protesters. That also on head.

If center say this is state matter then TN people have no right to give income tax and cgst on commodities.

If local are asking to shut down the company then they must do.

370 2018-05-24 04:00:25 But prices of other commodities depends on diesel price as increase in transportation cost will affect the price of pulses etc.
371 2018-05-24 04:00:14 A little nuance in lumber, and some other commodities; it settles at 1:05 cst, but continues to trade until it closes at 4pm CST. The afternoon trade is still considered same day trading but the settlement sets the MTM.  Odd setup tomorrow.

373 2018-05-24 03:43:54 Petrol/disel may not be essential for transport of common man, but has significant impact on cost of essential commodities...

375 2018-05-24 03:41:24 e nossa infra? e o custo do pneu+diesel+asfalto(pedágio). E as commodities que são dolarizadas? Nossa economia é frágil.

377 2018-05-24 03:32:59 Times two cars and the price keeps going up. Additionally the price of oil is driving other commodities up... but you knew that, you just refuse to acknowledge it.

388 2018-05-24 02:45:50 Optimize productivity at what expense?  Anybody who has ever worked for a corporate entity knows lower level employees are treated like commodities. They're expendible and insignificant to CEOs like Bezos
389 2018-05-24 02:41:19 Dont buy into the hype of semi precious commodities. If you cant afford gold or platinum invest in silver or bullion. If you're paying $30 for a 5oz Ingot of copper you're an absolute fool.
390 2018-05-24 02:41:12 ""Municipalities are required to procure certain commodities from local producers,58 municipalities(57%) out of 102 were audited local procurement failed to comply with regulation on promotion of local producers on award amounting to R587 million" #AGreport
391 2018-05-24 02:40:24 Are you really so naive or are you feigning naivete? Demand and supply theory applies to most commodities but certainly not the only cause for the existing levels of prices of Petroleum. To reduce demand for Petrol, you want people to adopt bullock carts?

395 2018-05-24 02:16:20 I hate to keep beating up on #KarlMarx but I also can't believe today's intellectual class buys his antiquated ideas. Another quote from Capital: "all commodities, as values, are realized human labour." Uh, except they're not.

409 2018-05-24 00:50:28 Like, it has to be KAT or Kawhi. They are known commodities. When you pick #1, you hope for players like either of those two. Somehow fans seem to think Ayton has been a 5-year nba all-star and is still only 19 years old.

413 2018-05-24 00:37:44 I used to be excited about new technology. That is, until my life, my image, my identity, and my privacy became the property of large corporations and governments and is bought and sold like commodities. I’m over it. Amazon, you’re hard to love.
414 2018-05-24 00:35:39 Exactly. There is only so much rail capacity. If oil transports reduced, other commodities will gladly take up the slack.
415 2018-05-24 00:35:00 @jentromans You don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m in international shipping, mostly agricultural commodities especially soybeans, and this is the busiest year we’ve ever had and we’re shipping to everywhere but China.
416 2018-05-24 00:22:36 A hiperinflação do passado mudou de nome e virou aumento do combustível. Muito mais eficaz na arrecadação(tri tributado), muito mais nocivo ao trabalhador, e não impacta na inflação como commodities. Um negócio da China pra maquiar o impacto da crise em ano de eleição!
417 2018-05-24 00:06:35 Agora surgem os especialistas em commodities. Acabo de ler que “os preços petrobras flutuam com o mercado internacional, mas a empresa não vende este tipo de petróleo
