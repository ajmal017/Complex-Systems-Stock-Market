1) buy lavender oil (just in case it happens again)
2) close your eyes and replay your day in your head idk works for me
2 2018-07-31 23:59:16 Try cooking some weevilly macaroni laced with plenty of chilli powder and a dash of olive oil. If that doesn't tempt her, mix chilli powder and oil, put in a syringe and force feed her. Usually works.
3 2018-07-31 23:59:02 black seed oil works well too but a lot of people are iffy about using it, which idk why. but the bumps disappear instantly
4 2018-07-31 23:59:01 I had an empty bottle of lotion in lavender-vanilla, a scent that has since been altered for the worse by the maker so is no longer available in its good form. And I had a full bottle of lavender-vanilla massage oil, which I never use.

39 2018-07-31 23:56:59 Import and export timing. Lower exports from OPEC filters into the market at the end of August/September. Right now, the oil market is digesting the June export ramp.
40 2018-07-31 23:56:52 will I have to hot oil wrestle you for them? 
41 2018-07-31 23:56:33 An oil drum for catching rainwater...Ack!  A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting!
42 2018-07-31 23:56:24 The human mind and body are the most valuable resource in the planet.  The materials have been here for billions of years, but without minds and hands to make them our spaceships would still be rock and oil.  Just gotta keep figuring out the next problem and the next.
43 2018-07-31 23:56:23 I’m looking at this stuff in my car. Disgusted. Oil light on. Disgusted. This rent I gotta pay. Disgusted. My back account. Disgusted
44 2018-07-31 23:56:18 Sure thing champ, I guess the 11 years I spent living across Europe doesn’t count as travelling. And when I was in Italy it was common to take your own vessels to fill up oil, wine and spices/flour.
45 2018-07-31 23:56:12 I hear say Oil Rig lease dey expire soon and Bubu say he no go hand them back to individuals. He say an individual no suppose own oil Block. Hence the panic. They want him out. 
46 2018-07-31 23:56:06 Thanks frungs! I’m now the marketing manager for Jackson Oil and Solvents. I think I was overdue for a change. Pretty excited right now!
47 2018-07-31 23:56:04 I’ve heard really great things about CBD Oil so I’d love to try it!
48 2018-07-31 23:55:48 Is the media going to let the Snake-Oil-Salesman-in-Chief get away with vowing that Mexico would pay for his wall all during his campaign, & now claiming, "Democrats won't pay for my wall!"?
49 2018-07-31 23:55:45 i honestly hate when my coconut oil turns into liquid

51 2018-07-31 23:55:06 They say the camera adds 10 pounds. Looks like oil on canvas subtracts 50. #lyingeye #Dotard
52 2018-07-31 23:54:46 It leaks way more than the alternative of not increasing the volumes of shipped oil via ANY mode of transportation, and reducing our consumption ASAP.
53 2018-07-31 23:54:31 Top of the line? Sounds like you're peddling more snake oil.
54 2018-07-31 23:54:18 Even worse they won't tell you what game they like. I've had mine come on from oil... To the thermostat 
55 2018-07-31 23:54:17 People think its funny but its actually dangerous as oil, gas, glass and bits of metal can be thrown into peoples faces from doing this.

66 2018-07-31 23:52:17 Ok. That explains an abundance of oil for those Minorah candles.

74 2018-07-31 23:50:36 Hmm, there is a point with very non-flammable oils where you find difficulty in ignition, but linseed oil is quite flammable on its own. There is a tradeoff between reducing friction sensitivity while increasing heat sens with oils, depending on your needs.
75 2018-07-31 23:50:14 To be fair capitalism has managed to bring on a climate apocalypse in only the barest sliver of human history, but hey the soviets burned oil too. We'll never see if they'd have responded any better, and I doubt it given its fucking Russia and full of oil.
76 2018-07-31 23:50:08 I've been saying it for years: he's owned by the Wilk Bros.  The Wilks are fossil fuel industry executives who shape his agenda. That's why most of the Daily Wire articles are pro-fracking, pro-fossil fuel. It's hilarious how he'll bend over backwards to defend fracking/coal/oil

-you can get car emissions at any oil lube/autodealership place FREE the state pays for it

105 2018-07-31 23:47:13 Sodium nitrate melts around 307 °C, at which point it is well ready to react with fuels. OIly substances *will* certainly reduce friction and impact sensitivity, but can increase heat sensitivity depending on the fuel nature of the oil, as in this case.

110 2018-07-31 23:46:36 Yes, and it’s not as weird as it sounds, because American cheese is...not cheese. Mixed into the hot broth, it mostly serves to make the broth thicker and creamy. (I subbed toasted sesame oil for the pat of butter, because it’s aromatic, and also added cilantro to the scallions.)
111 2018-07-31 23:46:34 Heightened geopolitical risk in the MidEast increases the likelihood of volatility in global energy markets. The rebalancing of the oil market pursued by OPEC over the past 18 months means that geopolitical developments now have a more pronounced effects.(Iran will exploit this)

149 2018-07-31 23:39:25 In honor of #NationalAvocadoDay  I'm making an avocado butter, oil and hemp face lotion. I imagine @jjbittenbinders would appreciate it.
150 2018-07-31 23:39:20 I paid all of my bills today....got my oil changed and went grocery shopping.... if anyone wants to donate me some money I’ll take it 
151 2018-07-31 23:39:04 I think she struck oil tho
152 2018-07-31 23:38:56 Not bashing and I’d be proud too but new oil field workers or pipelines post so much about there job I feel like I’m there lol
153 2018-07-31 23:38:38 Use coconut oil! Or Savila (Aloe), it works super well!
154 2018-07-31 23:38:23 Off to do this hot oil treatment. Death to everyone that convinced me that this hair color was a good idea. Well, maybe not death, but dishonor on your family!
155 2018-07-31 23:38:17 It pisses me off that big money and politician's pocket money. 

They withhold and kill vital tech.

For oil. For money. 

Fuck politicians.
156 2018-07-31 23:38:14 They can use their oil money to rebuild
157 2018-07-31 23:38:13 soooooo today i started my first oil fire and i only cried once i love being an adult
158 2018-07-31 23:38:03 psa: a salad that is simply a side dish should only contain the following ingredients: tomatoes, cucumbers, cut parsley, pinch of fresh mint, then dressed with salt, lemon, & olive oil.  onions. & lettuce is for sandwiches or salads that are a main course(totally different)
159 2018-07-31 23:37:59 @kaitlynbristowe kait I swear by peppermint oil!
160 2018-07-31 23:37:43 Aight aight so shampoo x2 (sometimes I do 3), rinse, conditioner, wash face and body, rinse conditioner and wtf is oil
161 2018-07-31 23:37:29 I see a lot of setups both long and short. I should probably walk away and just stick with oil.
162 2018-07-31 23:37:03 Genesco Olive Oil Co?
163 2018-07-31 23:37:00 I went and got an oil change on my car I feel like a whole ass grown-up
164 2018-07-31 23:36:59 my favorite essential oil is bacon grease
165 2018-07-31 23:36:55 寝ぼけて不本意な票を入れてしまった
166 2018-07-31 23:36:47 Jr Trudeau is trying to treat America like Sr Trudeau did. 

Difference is Sr Trudeau had oil as leverage in the middle of a global oil crisis.  Jr Trudeau needs to release different tactics needed for different circumstances.

Meanwhile QC policy is to rely on the US for O&G
167 2018-07-31 23:36:45 yeah u need body oil
168 2018-07-31 23:36:42 I’m trying to learn how to change my own oil and I have everything except another car jack 
169 2018-07-31 23:36:31 Eigth in line for succession:

171 2018-07-31 23:36:30 You obviously haven’t watched the video. It’s not even about climate change. When your oil world crumbles, don’t say you weren’t told it was coming. Try not to become another Kodak or Blackberry.
172 2018-07-31 23:36:15 Korean and Latinos working together while arguing while performing an oil change in my car is what I needed 
173 2018-07-31 23:36:14 You can remove it with hand sanitizer and oil. That’s how I remove black marker from my hands when I right on my hand. I have a habit of writing on my hand since grammar school
174 2018-07-31 23:36:08 ok so tomorrow esther goes back to the vet
thursday my car gets an oil change/100k mile checkup
friday i'm driving to @allfleshisgrass 
175 2018-07-31 23:35:35 I don't get it. Thanks to Reagan's deregulation of all kinds of shit we had our generations depression, and we gave million dollar welfare to the banks. And who gives a fuck about Native people's losing their land, and possibly contaminating a water supply for fucking oil.
176 2018-07-31 23:35:29 Oil? Tf?
177 2018-07-31 23:35:29 Going to bed with a tub of coconut oil, a hair mask & oil on my head trying to get my hair back to good condition, pls pls pls work 
178 2018-07-31 23:35:18 The most unrealistic thing about this ain't even if they are or aren't a couple, is that dude's a "healthy eater" but none of these chicks know that coconut oil exists and is good for broom-like strands? HOW COME?
179 2018-07-31 23:35:14 おっぱいーーーーーーｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗｗ
180 2018-07-31 23:34:56 I was frying up some corn tortillas for dinner tonight and some oil splattered on my arm at one point, it kinda stings.  not too bad tho, just some red spots is all!
181 2018-07-31 23:34:55 no bro its shampoo x2, rinse, conditioner, wash face n body, rinse conditioner, oil, rinse
182 2018-07-31 23:34:41 DC habitually “misplaces:”  $B’s in cash, supplies, equipment, etc. (Iraq/Afghanistan), no consequences.  GOPs donors “misplace” casino’s, oil rigs, servers, etc., heads would roll.  That’s just stuff, not human life.  #Resist #BlueWave2018 @RepAdamSchiff @RepMaxineWaters
183 2018-07-31 23:34:32 Does your car need synthetic oil too? 
184 2018-07-31 23:34:00 GDP is a standard every single country uses! It's a standard of economic stability! It shows a country makes profit from INDUSTRY & EXPORTS! FYI it means it's not Burger & fries work! It's selling things like soy beans cars oil gas cars steel! Obama rotted ur mind with stupidity
185 2018-07-31 23:33:56 “After years of re-building foreign countries, its time to finally re-build OUR country.” - President @realDonaldTrump 

Cue the Midnight Oil: the time has come, a facts a fact, this land belongs to us... we’re gonna take it back!  #USA #MAGA #TrumpTampa #TrumpRally
186 2018-07-31 23:33:50 WHAT'S REAL: The Times of "the 5 WISE" Are Here... Cause those called "FOOLISH", Feel ENTITLED  to Prepare Through YOUR SUPPLY OF OIL!!! They want what YOU HAVE bc They've Waisted what They Had!!
187 2018-07-31 23:33:38 Mk96 needs an oil change and I should've done it 300 miles ago...oops :/

190 2018-07-31 23:32:59 Maybe if DoTerra came out with a marajuana oil....
191 2018-07-31 23:32:53 United States will intervene when there are raw minerals at stake or oil or if geographically it's a strategic point. Beyond that you're on your own
192 2018-07-31 23:32:53 August 1st and evil oil company has to cut me another pension cheque.

195 2018-07-31 23:32:24 Works for me... When the Special Counsel is reportedly down to checking tweets ... all those promised oil wells must have been dry holes. But whatever. We will know by 2021 or so...

198 2018-07-31 23:31:41 Mrs Danvers isn't exactly an oil painting.
199 2018-07-31 23:31:35 I accidentally got root beer fragrance oil on my shirt and now I just want a root beer popsicle 
200 2018-07-31 23:31:29 USA respected again in the world....soon to be the largest oil producer in the world.

205 2018-07-31 23:30:20 they could also be holding other materials and not shipping oil at all. What were the UN numbers on the sides in the removable diamond tags? usually you will see them go in patterns or groups of them in a row.
206 2018-07-31 23:29:39 Thanks I do pasta tahdig the same as lavash or potato slices W oil/butter, then a pasta layer, then I layer the rest of pasta with the meat sauce
207 2018-07-31 23:29:31 Bitcoin oil trade with China is ready
208 2018-07-31 23:29:26 Got to love it when you make a 3 pm appointment for an oil change and it's 4:30 and they still haven't even started on your vehicle
209 2018-07-31 23:29:25 Better yet, make 1 then go fire it.
210 2018-07-31 23:29:14 Oil money is my favorite money. Im fixin to dissapear for a few months lol
211 2018-07-31 23:29:03 After cooking flautas w my moms I’ve realized I’m a lil bitch and cried every time the oil popped on me
212 2018-07-31 23:28:36 What do you miss the most isis, Blacks Burning there cities down, people targeting police , shitty healthcare, major oil spills, 20 trillion in debt, Arming the Mexican cartel?

214 2018-07-31 23:28:34 Jenny McCarthy is actually verified.  Have you read the Panic Virus by @sethmnookin ? It’s a fantastic read about these snake oil salesmen taking advantage of parents and endangering the world in the process.
215 2018-07-31 23:28:34 OUR AMAZING President Trump is taking down the crowd at the Florida rally! I'm so grateful for his hard work, political incorrectness and economic prowess. Unemployment lowest in decades and GDP growth rate is 4.1! Oil production at all time high and US is EXPORTING natural gas!
216 2018-07-31 23:28:31 I don't get it, there's no Space Oil, what's the Space Motive?
217 2018-07-31 23:28:26 Hence avoiding sugar, soya, almonds, cashews, palm oil & all highly processed high carb composite factory made products is crucial.  Eat local & seasonal - be it veg, meat, dairy or baked products.
218 2018-07-31 23:28:03 I should rlly take this jar of coconut oil (that currently no one can open) to the gym and ask someone to buss it open
219 2018-07-31 23:27:16 I need a milk and oil cleanser, a day and night moisturizer, lactic serum and pumpkin mask
220 2018-07-31 23:27:01 Well if it starts dripping oil that's what it is, nice ride otherwise I've got a 2010 myself

222 2018-07-31 23:26:11 Religious tourism put Saudia in the map even before oil discovery. 13 million a year. They charge an arm and leg for it.
223 2018-07-31 23:26:03 Just like everything else with the Trump Regime, everything's inside out.
The EPA; which incidentally was started by Nixon has become a K Street oil & gas lobby. Trump proposes merging Dept. of Education with Labor? Child slavery must be in the offing.
ICE used to do good work.
224 2018-07-31 23:26:02 The whole notion is absurd. And Russia had to tack towards Saudi Arabia to preserve the specter of oil cooperation for market prices, but that rationale is now over in the new market environment. It can't dictate terms on the ground in Syria or Libya. It's stuck now.
225 2018-07-31 23:25:58 @MichelleSaltCGY Re: Your FB. 1. For your burns, Vitamin E oil will help. Almost fully eliminated my surgery scars. 2.

226 2018-07-31 23:25:38 That's what the privileged selfie king wants. That is his goal, Trump wants coal to be great Trudeau wants oil dead. @JustinTrudeau
227 2018-07-31 23:25:32 Man I gotta go get an oil change tomorrow
228 2018-07-31 23:25:14 I’ve tried the oil cleanser, night creme, and lactic acid serum. I reviewed the night creme briefly here, but I’ll be doing a more thorough review of it and the other products. So far, 10/10 for the night creme and lactic acid. The oil cleanser I haven’t used enough.

235 2018-07-31 23:24:40 Would you like some eggs with your oil
236 2018-07-31 23:24:39 I don't  think that,
This world, With oil money .
Don't see, don't hear.
Don't ..???? at soon
237 2018-07-31 23:24:37 Interesting how the US military are concerned - they are also a major polluter 
Essentially they fight for oil to fuel their tanks and jets - the day those machines no longer need oil for fuel, the military strategy will change - and the whole world will follow. 
Not sure where
238 2018-07-31 23:24:14 Picked up this gorgeous #kale at @bayonnefarmersmarket that was picked this morning by @ortfarms. Took it right home and sautéed it in a little olive oil. So fresh and delicious! @ Bayonne Farmers' Market
239 2018-07-31 23:24:07 dr. bronner’s lavender soap + lavender essential oil combo is undefeated.
240 2018-07-31 23:24:05 The Prize by Daniel Yergin is a worth while read for anyone interested in Oil's geopolitical, social, & economic impact

Slightly longer of a book, but it has amazing depth for the wide range of history it attempts to elucidate.

P.s Daniel Yergin also authored Commanding Heights
241 2018-07-31 23:23:46 Ty- I’ll check it out, hoping it helps-2% oil had no effect on me-doc that took care of me w/spinal blocks, PhysTherapy &meds moved-finding it impossible to replace him and I’m suffering terribly-Gov Scott pushed an rx law that’s draconian-guess he knows medicine better than drs
242 2018-07-31 23:23:42 Is there anything better than the smell of fresh garlic and onions sautéeing in olive oil? 
243 2018-07-31 23:23:29 Olive oil Oliphant
244 2018-07-31 23:23:23 @SpyOptionTrader neither at the moment. Only holding soybean oil. Swinging it maybe a few weeks
245 2018-07-31 23:23:14 i love as im driving into post i smell oil. its such a comforting smell.
246 2018-07-31 23:23:11 im an olive oil, salt, pepper and nutritional yeast kinda vibe and it will also catch some bacon grease like my spinach and eggs do. as @DominicDAgosti2 puts it, vegetables are great fat delivery vehicles
247 2018-07-31 23:23:10 Selling snake oil...
248 2018-07-31 23:23:04 Oil man drinks your milkshake.
249 2018-07-31 23:22:59 its weird no one talking about that oil contract anymore ...
250 2018-07-31 23:22:51 Coconut oil scores 4 out of 5 on the comodogenic scale, with 5 being MOST pore clogging. There are other oils though with low ratings like hempseed, jojoba, almond (:
251 2018-07-31 23:22:47 ほうほうほうなるほど！！！！あれだっけ？チュートリアルで出るキャラって決まってるんだっけ？

258 2018-07-31 23:21:45 I really need to start treating my car with more love & respect. Baby needs a car wash and oil change. I’ve been neglecting her 
259 2018-07-31 23:21:38 From music by the Esopus to art by the Esopus, we’ve got it happening in our beautiful “backyard”.  Fifteen of us out doing watercolor and oil painting (with Karen O’Neil) today, enjoying the great outdoors.
260 2018-07-31 23:21:33 Dang, if Big Oil can’t read the market and avoid being ever-so-slowly bankrupt by Canada somehow, it sounds like they are absolutely terrible businessmen.

I can’t believe throwing billions at KM to buy their pipeline was actually a way of bankrupting them!
261 2018-07-31 23:21:32 So what you sYing is we need some Oil 
262 2018-07-31 23:21:27 Any work this creates will only be temporary. I don't see this leading to higher levels of exploitation of Oil. This is just your stupidity attacking Trudeau between you screaming about illegal immigration which any Canadian not from the suburbs of Toronto knows is a nonissue
263 2018-07-31 23:21:26 looks amazing already, add oil!!

273 2018-07-31 23:19:57 or olive oil they are interchangeable
274 2018-07-31 23:19:55 uuuggghhhh why does that one brownfacer have to guest he prolly smells like tanning oil and bacon
275 2018-07-31 23:19:50 I never followed that cause it didn’t make sense to me. I use leave in then the cream (if there’s one) and finally oil (olive to be precise).
276 2018-07-31 23:19:36 if they did that - now how could they play chicken little?  Who in their right mind is going to spend $10,000 plus materials for a $900 fire armt?

278 2018-07-31 23:19:34 And when is the last time that a Tory balanced the budget (that they didn't inherit from a previous Liberal or NDP govt) that didn't involve oil? Is the Dear Leader going to discover oil in Etobicoke?

291 2018-07-31 23:18:18 Men constantly look for a cheaper way to go to Heaven. The world is full of snake oil salesmen who will sell them a cheaper way. It's bogus
292 2018-07-31 23:18:05 Man drilling ground for oil.
293 2018-07-31 23:17:49 My dumbass scheduled an oil change for tomorrow at 8am bc I thought I worked 
294 2018-07-31 23:17:43 I think in my timeline the analogy begins after Pearl Harbor as we converted our factories to building bombs and tanks to beat the Germans, so basically taking our factories and using them to build solar panels and then destroying the world’s oil producing capacity
295 2018-07-31 23:17:15 The thing is.. 95% (just a guess) will adhere to the low-fat, high-carb, grain-based, pro veggie oil dogma.

That's why they are losing stature.

The roads are less work people like me... And the reward is greater.
296 2018-07-31 23:17:14 I get it. While I do see how they help wild animals after devastating things like oil spills etc... I dont go to the Orca shows because i can't stand to see their dropped fins. Ugh...

302 2018-07-31 23:15:48 went in for an oil change, my breaks were sqeaky and my tire needed to be patched.  Oil change free. Car wash&vacuum free.  Tire patch FREE.  And my breaks are fine theres just a 25$ fee for checking it out.  HOW AMAZING.
303 2018-07-31 23:15:45 Yup. I make it with soy sauce, hoisen sauce and sesame oil with some minced garlic then just add whatever meat and veggies I’m craving that day.

This is United States who is stealing Iraq oil + Afghanistan mineral materials including uranium and gold while poor Afghan and Iraqis live in poverty.

321 2018-07-31 23:14:07 Thank you God for giving me this odd feeling that I had to check my oil bcuz it’s a good thing I did.. open the hood, and there’s a little baby kitten huddled up next to my engine block. Was able to get him out with no harm done

330 2018-07-31 23:10:55 In my experience, they aren't that deep. I was at CompUSA returning a CD yrs ago when an old man was standing at the counter waiting for his daughter & grandson who were shopping. He started going off on Arabs and how they own all the oil etc. There were abt 12 folks in 2 lines.

334 2018-07-31 23:10:25 Agree but you can't have hyperinflation in oil prices anyway ,by definition ,as hyperinflation is the rapid increase in average prices. Individual price changes do not cause inflation .Too much money does

353 2018-07-31 23:06:48 Well that's good. But mint pear is a good company so you could check out that oil
354 2018-07-31 23:06:47 No because her argument is that it is more dangerous because of the benzene. Rather dlibit has substantially less benzene than any other crude oil and much less than gasoline. As such it is much safe from a toxicological perspective.
355 2018-07-31 23:06:43 My dad: Have you checked the oil in the car

366 2018-07-31 23:05:17 German and Japanese steel is better than American, They'll get a better deal on oil from OPEC than from us, and our largest crop is CORN and the EU has banned high fructose corn syrup. So... what do we have left, American cars?

376 2018-07-31 23:02:47 Our society is built around the idea that energy is practically free. Developing nations *already*  use half as much energy as we do in the developed world.  They don't need the kind of infrastructure we've built to funnel money to big oil companies.

395 2018-07-31 23:00:06 I slice them really thin (takes forever) then start sautéing them in olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper, then add bacon. It’s really good and fairly healthy

404 2018-07-31 22:59:12 Bacon fat popcorn is amazing, but its smoke point is a little lower than veg oil, so you'll get more scorching.
405 2018-07-31 22:58:59 I just retired from many years in the oil biz. I would meet people in the airport...OIL BIZ! OH NO! So I would explain a world with oil is bad...can you imagine a world without it? Then, ‘hey, do you think it’s OK for kerosene in the plane we’re getting on?’

412 2018-07-31 22:57:41 5/  911 was the crime of the century. The biggest clue that Bin Laden had nothing to do with it, is the fact that the USA promptly invaded an innocent oil rich nation on the basis of a lie concocted by the real perpetrators. Every atrocity since, (even Trump) stems from 911.

427 2018-07-31 22:55:38 I make a mean roast duck...  rubbed with a mixture of black pepper, crushed red pepper, and rosemary in olive oil......

That reminds me..... I actually have one in my basement freezer.  Now how to convince the Mrs. that it’s time to thaw it out and eat it?
428 2018-07-31 22:55:12 I don’t think I can go /: I need an oil change on my car since the trip to Mexico
429 2018-07-31 22:55:02 LOC method! Liquid (water), Oil (of your choice), cream (Shea Moisture Leave-In Conditioner). This method has done wonders for my hair! My hair seems to retain moisture for like 3 to 4 days.

436 2018-07-31 22:53:23 @Elemis after some advice- currently use dynamic resurfacing cleanser, exfoliating pads, day cream and night cream. What would be your next essential purchase from Elemis- mask, serum, face oil?

439 2018-07-31 22:53:13 His says line 3 is about easy profits and at the same time Canadian oil is so cheap it will block electric cars.  

Also the old line 3 operating at much reduced capacity has too many spills yet a new line isn't about environmental safety.

452 2018-07-31 22:51:35 In theory, It would work... but the powers that be (big oil, pharm, CEOs, etc.) tend to rat  hole the money and not so much “trickles down”. In many cases, You have to grind and have multiple sources of income in today’s America.

エキストラバージンオリーブオイルとはオリーブの果実を搾ってろ過しただけのバージンオイルです。
457 2018-07-31 22:51:14 WTF?! 70$ to change the damn oil in my car. (P.S. this guy rolled his eyes at me when I told him I only had 6,000 miles on my car. RUDE).
458 2018-07-31 22:50:52 Drain the rice in a colander and rinse rice with cold water. Place rice in oven pot drizzle some oil over the rice, and cover with lid. place in 400 preheated oven for 10-12 min. lower heat to 300 and cook for another 25 min or until fragrant.
459 2018-07-31 22:50:46 We wash hair and body with Olive oil soap. Three ingredients. No harsh chemicals, dyes, or scents. Love it. Our source is greekinternetmarket dot com and the brand is Papoutsanis. I expect you'll have to find another vender if you wish to try it.
460 2018-07-31 22:50:37 He couldn’t even understand what a sub-investment grade credit rating meant. If I was Sturgeon I’d do a deal with China over Oil, fish, whiskey etc in exchange for basic support. Tell the truth to the people and get on with it. A properly run independent Scotland could be great.

468 2018-07-31 22:48:45 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
469 2018-07-31 22:48:45 Getting my oil changed and I’m just sitting in the waiting area & the middle aged guy at the desk says “boy you better swipe right on someone or you never gonna get a date.” Thank you Sir for reminding me.
470 2018-07-31 22:48:44 You just want to get all the nations of the world hooked on Big Oil and it’s citizens to back IMF loans for infrastructure improvements. Just look at poor Puerto Rico. $70 Billion in debt ! For what ? Oh loans for infrastructure so that businesses will relocate. All lies!
471 2018-07-31 22:48:34 Zinke increased the # of American wild horses that can be sold for slaughter from 4 to 25, so the gov't can make $ off of them. I don't trust him to do anything. He's in office to fulfill Trump's promises to sport hunters, Big Cattle, & Big Oil men who supported his campaign.
472 2018-07-31 22:48:33 nbd but i just underestimated a pot full of scalding hot oil and almost sent my kitchen up in flames
473 2018-07-31 22:48:29 The planet is on fire like never before, temperature records broken, whole species of animals in danger and disappearing and oil companies posting gigantic profits while destroying habitat. A hero tries to stop the progression and gets thrown in jail.
474 2018-07-31 22:48:00 our religion is not christianity, islam, judaism, our religion is nationalism, weaponization, forces, g20, oil, war, we don't need human beings and prosperity and working for humanity no rich consider, due to poor to rich we worship money we live n die for it

477 2018-07-31 22:47:14 also coconut oil!!!! they disappear overnight !!
478 2018-07-31 22:47:11 Definite YES! A country with the third largest oil reserves in the world should not be importing oil. Canadians want to support their own oil  industry. Buy local.
479 2018-07-31 22:46:41 Oil your own machine.  You four jokers should concentrate your own projects.
480 2018-07-31 22:46:30 lol I really am out here oil painting, listening to classical music and cloud rap alternatingly, and smoking the occasional "strong" cigarette

483 2018-07-31 22:45:58 Oil doesn't make anyone happy.
484 2018-07-31 22:45:55 On the upside, Skin So Soft does seem to work, as does essential oil citronella mixed with body lotion. For me at least.

509 2018-07-31 22:43:17 #tytlive I think Trump should float the idea of putting a tariff on all oil & gas LEAVING the states. That'll put them in their place.

514 2018-07-31 22:42:44 Use gloves for cleaning and moisture with olive oil twice a day atleast.
515 2018-07-31 22:42:41 That could have been oil. It's ambiguous.
516 2018-07-31 22:42:30 It’s not fun having to lie down with olive oil swimming about in your ear to try and unblock it.
517 2018-07-31 22:42:27 which country has such dumb ppl willing to destroy their own nation & put well being of their own next generations at risk??

527 2018-07-31 22:41:23 No like fresh out of the oil 
528 2018-07-31 22:41:22 I get the feeling that we are almost as dependent on oil as we were 4 years ago and haven't come across any date to suggest differently
529 2018-07-31 22:41:19 I would like this re-worded. Alberta's or western Canadian oil and gas....

539 2018-07-31 22:39:55 Dear Comrades, 

I think we should all get together and collude with Russia, being that according to our President and his attorney, it’s definitely not a crime. 

Who’s with me?

—Snake Oil
540 2018-07-31 22:39:42 Throw a shot of whiskey or bourbon in some hot tea. Epsom salt with eucalyptus oil or spearmint in a bath will help chills and sore muscles and the steam can help break up congestion
541 2018-07-31 22:39:22 In theory it was mushroom and truffle oil but I’m pretty sure it was rice, dish water and broken dreams
542 2018-07-31 22:39:14 Stream might be a little delayed tonight. I really need to get the oil changed in my car and I can't get it done sooner than 5. Once I'm home, I'll tweet out the stream and we'll jump into dishonored. Til then, I got more stuff to do around the house but wanted to update here
543 2018-07-31 22:39:04 "Phasing out the oil sands" is a far different comment from "stopping fossil fuel use". It singles out a specific contributor in the energy industry. Trudeau makes no mention of other fossil fuels.
544 2018-07-31 22:38:53 I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the oil that's in me should set hell on fire...
545 2018-07-31 22:38:44 If she doesn't have any Witch's Tit in, some of her other colors will work well with it (oil slick for sure, I forget what the other one was called offhand)
546 2018-07-31 22:38:36 public fund as if your 10 naira offering raised the foundation or oil money finished the building.
547 2018-07-31 22:38:32 It's no leadership issue, am telling as a Nigerian that it is all about the oil price.
548 2018-07-31 22:38:28 only india, w 1/5th of US/China size, 1.3B ppl (1000 million more than US) , 500 million utter poor, little resources (half of revenue spent in Oil) & still India has dumbest among dumb asking it to handle around 15 million illegals Bangladeshis??
549 2018-07-31 22:38:27 is the "flavor" the oil marinade from the BP oil spill?
550 2018-07-31 22:38:26 Why is coconut  oil so spendy ?? sheesh 
551 2018-07-31 22:38:22 You may know palm oil isn't very healthy for us. But alot of forests are being cleared for oil palms. Just another thing a lot of people don't pay attention to. I guess most people don't think it's important. So much life is dying and no one does anything. Just let that sink in.
552 2018-07-31 22:38:19 Use olive oil as a conditioner by leaving it warmed up on your hair for 15 minutes before shampoo.
553 2018-07-31 22:38:14 brought to you by the fine people who sell guns - No wait - cigarettes - No wait - Oil - No wait - dead livestock

557 2018-07-31 22:37:58 Sure, it's done those things. But do those contribute to Venezuela's dependence on oil? My argument wasn't "Venezuela is a failure look how bad it is"
558 2018-07-31 22:37:54 Tea tree oil or cream!
559 2018-07-31 22:37:44 girl cactus water make up removing wipes and charcoal oil removing face scrub!
560 2018-07-31 22:37:26 Them, not you. It has been sickening to watch their descent, knowing how their snake oil poisons the minds of the old white people who revere Fox.
561 2018-07-31 22:37:11 Clearly you do not know how to answer. If the US produces 10.45m BPD and consumes a total of nearly 20m BPD can you elaborate on your math. Clearly your equation is not adding up. Can you put some numbers. Net net there must be imports of just over 9m BPD of oil or products.
562 2018-07-31 22:37:09 Early on Obama did increase oil production, it was later in the administration that he started making life alittle harder on the oil man. Probably to play to his base.
563 2018-07-31 22:36:47 $120 for my oil change. I think it’s time for a new car 
564 2018-07-31 22:36:43 I need a better scalp oil,cause my shit be itching..

569 2018-07-31 22:35:20 There is nothing like being stuck in some middle of shit nowhere parking lot in 104 heat with a dead phone and no charger trying to find the oil leak in ur van and periodically dumping ur drinking water on urself to keep cool. One of those truly humbling experiences
570 2018-07-31 22:35:13 fish oil is so gross.
571 2018-07-31 22:35:08 But it can’t be a scam, it says right in the tweet that there’s no snake oil!
572 2018-07-31 22:34:56 HI HOW ARE U I SUFFER FROM DRY SKIN ALSO I recommend Olay Moisturizer & raw whipped African Shea Butter & Vitamin e oil! 
573 2018-07-31 22:34:47 Making my own dairy free margarine seems too hard so I've got no solution for that one atm! At least I can get palm oil free nuttelex
574 2018-07-31 22:34:46 ❝Well I am sure you have some still, I heard you hang out with some❞

She replies, putting all the fish and veggies inside of the bowl. Mixing them with some salt and Olive oil.
575 2018-07-31 22:34:45 Which workers? Only peeps I see getting money are oil&gas workers and they working 7/12s and mostly in separate cities than their families, the rest of us struggling paycheck to paycheck
576 2018-07-31 22:34:33 Someone asked me what the key to life was and I said coconut oil
577 2018-07-31 22:34:33 I got drenched, almost blown over, covered in oil, but it was super cool and I didn’t totally f*ck it up. That fig. of 8 stuff is trickier than it looks!
578 2018-07-31 22:34:28 Finally started this Aloe Vera kick. I hope it’s not a scam like Coconut oil is.

583 2018-07-31 22:33:35 Look into high CBD, low THC cannabis oil or a one to one ratio depending on the type of breast cancer. Do some research, there is lots of info out there, hon. Give her a huge hug from Canada.
584 2018-07-31 22:33:20 by october i’ll regret it but it’s time i started back using castor oil in my hair
585 2018-07-31 22:33:11 It’s a shame to go for an oil change and tire rotation and come out spending $400. It’s not right!
586 2018-07-31 22:33:07 Burn the midnight oil if you want a royal and luxury life! 
#thingstoremember
587 2018-07-31 22:32:42 But they dnt challenge Elizabeth who is a true dictator herself. Libyans were injected with a propaganda to kill their leader whom they lived with dignity under him, today they kill each other while America loot their oil.
588 2018-07-31 22:31:37 Somebody send me $50 to get my oil changed 
589 2018-07-31 22:31:35 Worked a long crunch day a month or two back and I spent a good chunk of it listening to Oil Ocean act 2
590 2018-07-31 22:31:32 just changed the oil in my car LMFAOOO  my life a movie
591 2018-07-31 22:31:18 Sheffield, Aston Villa, Feyenoord and Ajax dnt even play in PL still their academy graduates have more PL minutes than Man City's academy graduates bcz its all about Oil Money.
592 2018-07-31 22:31:14 Fair enough! But you can’t argue that crude oil production under obama grew (90% I believe over Bush. Which isn’t saying THAT much given that it took a nosedive under Bush (ironic since he is supposedly a Texas oil man - and I don’t say that lightly as I voted for him twice)
593 2018-07-31 22:30:58 Oh girl I have oil... learned real quick last winter that I need to cut my time in hot showers in half lol 
594 2018-07-31 22:30:56 I always aim for 15 days, it’s the recommended terms set out by govt for paying small business (somewhere)
Although (wrongly & ironically) I’ve accepted 30 from Govt because a) I know it’s practically difficult to turn the oil tanker & b) I know they are good for it
595 2018-07-31 22:30:54 Wait, where is the oil and gas land use???
596 2018-07-31 22:30:52 A little olive oil, a few minutes on the grill, I promise you'll love them!
597 2018-07-31 22:30:47 Why are ppl still buying fish oil supplements when they can just eat some yummy ass chia seeds dammit
598 2018-07-31 22:30:34 Exactly. Let them see the effort and expense involved, as well as what limitations there are of the guns.
599 2018-07-31 22:30:33 I like how my mom asks if I want take out from somewhere, but only if I go and get it. Especially after she wouldn't follow me to the car shop when I had to drop my car off for an oil change and brake check today, forcing me to pay for a lyft home

605 2018-07-31 22:29:24 El tea tree oil es lo mejor que existe para la cara, trátenlo and you’ll thank me later
606 2018-07-31 22:29:20 wowee why do oil change places take advantage of cute girls like me
607 2018-07-31 22:29:00 Grocery day again tomorrow, so wondering what I'm going to buy that I don't need this time.
One thing I actually need is more cooking oil.
And I need to figure out what to have for dinner...
608 2018-07-31 22:28:59 Oil changed, new tires bought and put on, tank filled, no money. This is adulthood.
609 2018-07-31 22:28:57  I put the clay mask on it and oil serum and it does
610 2018-07-31 22:28:56 おはようございます。電車待ってるけどこれ遅刻フラグでは(寝坊した)
611 2018-07-31 22:28:52 trying out oil pastels rn
it's weird
612 2018-07-31 22:28:49 In this respect, USA’s capitalism is terrified of the “competition” it claims to worship. See 1970s oil embargo & gas stations refusing to serve “foreign” autos.
613 2018-07-31 22:28:46 17 gave me a body lotion made with hemp seeds oil and now I smell...herby.
614 2018-07-31 22:28:45 I want an oil diffuser and a Himalayan salt lamp
615 2018-07-31 22:28:40 I don’t give a damn for Alberta Oil
616 2018-07-31 22:28:31 14.  When the day for burning rebellious slaves came, slaves whose masters had brought to be destroyed, were tied together with ropes and made to stand on piles of wood on which oil had been poured.  Crowds applauded while black SLAVES screamed and burnt to death.
That was HELL.
617 2018-07-31 22:28:26 Instead of getting an oil change I decided to get clothes and makeup cuz fuck my car I gotta look cute
618 2018-07-31 22:28:09 Aaron burnt the HECK out of some olive oil and now we are both suffocating to death with literal olive oil in our lungs. Pls pray and somebody save us
619 2018-07-31 22:28:05 The arbitrary and punitive nature of oil and gas, education and mining decisions amongst others are giving many companies pause on investment plans on the “who’s next” principle. Can I suggest you go round and ask some questions of ordinary business ppl.
620 2018-07-31 22:28:02 Bruh bring me the filter the oil and I’ll do that shot for you for free lmao
621 2018-07-31 22:27:57 BITCH HELL NOOOO yes he definitely needs sunscreen and not FRIGGIN COCONUT OIL GOOD LORD
622 2018-07-31 22:27:54 I use oil of oregano, and drink jiaogulan tea. For some reason, it helps me feel like I can breathe better.
623 2018-07-31 22:27:40 I had a magical moment sitting in the monsoon watching thunder light up the sky listening to Oil and Water by @Lights last night
624 2018-07-31 22:27:04 Also the molecules are too large to actually penetrate your skin so all your doing is putting an oil barrier on your skin that will make you break out
625 2018-07-31 22:26:57 Try the LOC method
I spray my hair w water then apply coconut oil then a water based cream
626 2018-07-31 22:26:49 I’ll take the Porsche. It cost $21,000 for an oil change on the Bugatti

629 2018-07-31 22:26:29 I think it’s fine. It’s more tacky so actually gentler on eyelashes IMO. Oil dissolves it easily as well!

632 2018-07-31 22:25:58 Old school church report. #Testimonytuesday I had a flat tire, no oil and needed help. A random unassuming person offered not because I was a woman (he was also helping a man) his words "truly isn't that the way it should be?"
633 2018-07-31 22:25:58 Ah, the classic, “look it happens here naturally” so our industrial-scale activities that make things _far_ worse should be dismissed.

Comparing natural oil seeps to the extent and magnitude of the tar sands activities is disingenuous.
634 2018-07-31 22:25:42 i got sprayed by hot oil from the pan and moaned so yeah just another day without sex
635 2018-07-31 22:25:37 Lol, the wordplay! 
The key is to add ample oil/ghee *before* adding the water.
636 2018-07-31 22:25:36 You do know what powers those electrical plants in china right? Its coal they also build a new powerplant every day. Even if every vehicle was electric we still need oil.
637 2018-07-31 22:25:28 We do love our olive oil! 
638 2018-07-31 22:25:22 Im finna go down to the wharf to do a shirtless photo shoot. If only I can find da baby oil.
639 2018-07-31 22:25:05 Totally on point, Eric. If you have a solid piece of meat, you don’t want to overkill with too much in the way of spices. You can also cut portions and try a light dusting of blackened spice, citrus rub on another, and a piece with just oil, salt and pepper.
640 2018-07-31 22:24:57 Ya girl dropped her oil cap underneath the damn engine . But shout out to my coworkers who was willing to help try and get it.
641 2018-07-31 22:24:54 Have you tried coconut oil?...it fixes everything!
642 2018-07-31 22:24:43 @realDonaldTrump doesn’t care about anyone but white evangelicals who buy his snake oil. Especially not brown children.
643 2018-07-31 22:24:41 Is 1% in non oil trade balanced enough?

647 2018-07-31 22:24:07 If you’re at home, let the oil fly oga 

Enjoy the meal
648 2018-07-31 22:24:03 Nah, right off the bottom next to the oil pan
649 2018-07-31 22:23:58 Yes, really. I go to my one of dozens of pot stores where there is a cornucopia of products from flower to oil to eatable candy & cookies to tinctures. They have sodas, cooking oils, & massage creams. They even have suppositories for pms. It’s heaven.
650 2018-07-31 22:23:58 my skin care routine is working in an italian restaurant and being absolutely covered in olive oil at all times
651 2018-07-31 22:23:49 "I have no reply but I call you stupid to feel better"

653 2018-07-31 22:23:39 I'm a fan of the bicycle. It frees you from the tyranny of oil companies *and* public transport.

And you get the thrill of motorists trying to kill you every day! For a second there this morning, I was absolutely certain the truck accelerating past me would hit and kill me

655 2018-07-31 22:23:17 How ironic given Trudeau’s hatred for oil.
656 2018-07-31 22:23:15 California is so far in the hole it isn’t even funny and they’re looking to now give hundreds of billions to illegals. That said, our gov is stupid for not taxing oil more. Makes no sense at all.
657 2018-07-31 22:23:14 Baba,  better buy the castro oil 
658 2018-07-31 22:23:12 So you've gotten an oil change like once

669 2018-07-31 22:21:17 Cuticle oil will help that a lot! You can usually find it at any nail care section, except at the dollar stores maybe.

I usually only remember to use when I redo my nails but even that little bit helped a lot!
670 2018-07-31 22:21:10 Well the big problem was the last president of US Obama, they continued financing the Venezuelan Revolution buying cheap oil, Shanon kept all the research and information about Hezbollah, Hamas and others risky groups, the situation now it's critical thanks to hide the truth.

678 2018-07-31 22:20:27 Not really. They benefited from the upswing of oil. They don't control weather and their impact on infrastructure has largely been finishing what the PCs started.

“Permian drillers are extracting 3.3MM bbl/day of oil making it one of the World’s leading producers - that is more than 2017s ave. daily crude production of the United Arab Emirates”

694 2018-07-31 22:18:47 Yeah. Years ago teaching in TX, I asked students what languages they spoke. One said "bad Spanish" I probed, as value judgement re language is fraught; turned out he was working on an oil rig w/Spanish speakers, so he picked some up

702 2018-07-31 22:17:57 Oh, Emily, I won’t shame you, but you really need to re-think your taste in food. Start with fresh, ripe avocados in a good salad with plenty of fresh, ripe tomatoes with olive oil and vinegar. Then you will graduate to guacamole. This from a meat eater.

704 2018-07-31 22:17:46 What you call subsidies are nothing more than tax cuts. The oil industry pays higher taxes (41%) than any other industry. When they get a tax break, (subsidies) it's to keep the cost down for consumers. Let's work with the facts instead of the BS
705 2018-07-31 22:17:29 Yet gas prices only seem to go up significantly when Republicans are in office? Hmmmm.... I am sure that the oil industry’s lobbying has. I thing to do with it though.

710 2018-07-31 22:16:17 Iconic Tip: Just don’t put moisturizer on parts of your face that are too oily, i.e. my oil mine of a nose. Is this revolutionary or stupid?

712 2018-07-31 22:16:07 Plus, in this sector, size appears to be important in terms of attracting institutional investors. Right now there's really just SU, HSE and maybe CNQ. Hopefully we run up a bit after merger is ratified. Then, a legit midcap leveraged oil play could really catch an INTNL bid.

733 2018-07-31 22:11:42 Yeah if you use tea tree oil you have to be careful to not over use it because it can be bad.

740 2018-07-31 22:10:53 My piercer told me to use 35% tea trea and 65% olive oil. Tea tree can dry out the piercing & make things more irritated so maybe try using a hydrating oil with it

754 2018-07-31 22:09:35 I would continue using either tea tree oil or something else to continue treating it as well.
755 2018-07-31 22:09:31 i bet there is an essential oil that claims to do it all

817 2018-07-31 21:58:20 Sadly, liberals seem finewith it. I am frightened, and unused to this amount of ugliness too. But I am frightened of what will happen if we don't stand ground and stand our ground even more. The loudest wheel gets the oil to often for us to quiet down.

821 2018-07-31 21:58:00 There's a chiropractic office and massage therapy office in the same building. Every time I go to the bathroom I smell essential oil diffused. I want to send them letters about how they can aggravate allergies/ other health problems. But how to do that constructively?
822 2018-07-31 21:57:38 You could make that argument, you could also make the argument that things Obama put in place led to a lot of oil field workers loseing their jobs.
823 2018-07-31 21:57:29 Lol I feel. That’s why it was my first and last time. You could probably use avocado oil and get the same effect. Don’t quote me on that though.
824 2018-07-31 21:57:27 I have a feeling you may have the pirates tats for a while!  or try baby oil? Happy birthday Mr TLF! 
825 2018-07-31 21:57:00 Amerjeet, what a useless tweet. Of course getting our oil to tidewater will create jobs. Now, you and your Liberal cronies need to get off your derrières and facilitate the construction. Get to Vancouver and do something about the unlawful protesters and stop the regulatory block
826 2018-07-31 21:56:58 With the price of oil being the way it is and y'all president, these gas prices about to be ridiculous
827 2018-07-31 21:56:54 Yup. Perhaps one of the upsides of oil running low is they may be content to let us go this time around.

That, and unlike Catalonia, the EU would be keen to back Scotland up.

832 2018-07-31 21:56:20 Standard oil, JP Morgan, Carnegie Steel are some examples. Any company that extensively commits vertical and horizontal merging is usually on its way to forming a monopoly. Modern examples include Disney, Sinclair media, AT&T, etc.
833 2018-07-31 21:56:15 Transcends politics as usual. He is a spoiled, rich brat who is poster child for desbouable human behavior. Further I’d argue that he had nothing to do witn oil and natural gas industry success.
834 2018-07-31 21:56:08 Yep. Oil revenues could be put to good use to help the people of Syria but they're not. It's a disgrace.
835 2018-07-31 21:56:06 Some of them were able to develop an App and device that could track and stop kidnapping and illegal oil bunkering before they occur. This is aiding in the beef up of security of humans and the pipelines.

841 2018-07-31 21:54:53 That's my point. How can the president conceive such unreasonable idea of building ranches in an oil producing state and building refinery other way round. Tah. Kolewerk
842 2018-07-31 21:54:32 yup!

in a kitchen or restaurant floor (which has spills), in a mechanic's shop w/ all kinds of fluids on the ground, on bowling lanes (which have oil on them) etc

nonslips have grooves for liquids to slide out thru so you have more contact w/ the walking surface and don't slide

854 2018-07-31 21:53:08 as they were both yoked together workin together and God's signs were done-souls were converted through these called ones-some too lazy stay tuned to Jesus-too lazy to pray-to commune with God-to read scriptures selves ect. wake up leaders now-get own oil in u now!)-
855 2018-07-31 21:53:07 Seems EU buckled for the oil delay by KSA.. 
856 2018-07-31 21:52:21 People who opened Cyber Cafe's back in the 90's & 2000 felt like they struck oil well. Please don't forget to evolve.  @badt_BOI_

860 2018-07-31 21:51:14 @nprscottsimon love your show but the Rancher bit was very shallow. Just what the anti-ESA wants everyone to hear. The truth is that the people behind killing the ESA wear suits, fly in private jets, and are CEO's of big Oil and Mining. Come out West, learn the real story.
861 2018-07-31 21:51:12 and if your dad checks the oil and it’s off the stick...well...

good luck charlie
862 2018-07-31 21:51:07 Ah. Perhaps they make crappy wheels? ;) Or...maybe the compound is quite dry. Oh well. Oil away.
863 2018-07-31 21:50:46 Plain, I hate palm oil. You know Ros, paramedics hv just been granted a pay rise, hadn’t realised it was only 20p an hour. Considering it took them an hour 2stabilise me, I think 20p extra is an insult. 20x12= thats £2.40 per shift isn’t that £74 per month? Gross that is.
864 2018-07-31 21:50:37 Can you not read? Our revenues are not in dinar, they are in USD. That's what petrodollar means, oil revenues are in USD. There's no conversion to dinar going on until it goes into *local* economy. Our international trade is entirely USD based.
865 2018-07-31 21:50:27 Congrats to the big man and still very much a novice in his first season with us. Rupert you are an Elite Roadman #oil #build #targets #2019

870 2018-07-31 21:49:44 Koch Brothers learned few lessons.When you feed a dog too much moolah, that dog might vomit on you. Second  lesson,when you try to buy an election, you might get end up with a snake oil salesman. #CNN #Trump
871 2018-07-31 21:49:31 But I disagree with a good chunk of where theyre headed.  Same with the GOP, they're bought and paid for mostly by the Koch network...and you can tell when if you look at the almost identical time they all went global warming skeptic.  Koch industries is an,oil and gas company ..

879 2018-07-31 21:48:58 احلي شهر ده ولا ايه 
880 2018-07-31 21:48:47 I've only tried one since the beginning that I stuck to. It's the 750mg HempWorx oil. They carry 500 but I need stronger. 
But.....  Go with what you think, scrolling down the timeline there's a lot more I would try, but I'm broke. Lol
881 2018-07-31 21:48:32 Lavender oil all over my pillow like yeah bitch insomnia I’m winning tonight.
882 2018-07-31 21:48:20 Maybe, but news is catching on fast.  Not fiction but fact. Oil is there....
883 2018-07-31 21:48:17 I don't trade gold but I dont think its USD dependant ...look at oil
884 2018-07-31 21:48:07 Haha, they don't have more operations, or no more oil via BabAlmandab
885 2018-07-31 21:47:57 I take the point about the difference between current members and « new » applicants, but I believe in the pragmatism of the EU, so when a country with more oil reserves, more gas reserves, and half the installed wind capacity of France comes a knocking, I see no major problem
886 2018-07-31 21:47:56 That's the beauty of democracy, best of luck
887 2018-07-31 21:47:49 I went for an oil change and left “needing” a filter change, tire pressure adjustment and some other weird test they had to do. I was there for an hour and a half and I just paid and signed. I need to stop going to the dealership to get my car taken care of.
888 2018-07-31 21:47:17 ありがとですー
いさわさんも棚卸しおつかれさま…！
889 2018-07-31 21:47:10 I wonder if that biotin wit coconut oil worth it ? 
890 2018-07-31 21:47:10 #LeapManifesto, giant steps, along a bilateral non alcoholic mind set. How much longer do Iranians and Americans consider, substructure of planet can sustain, man's invasive, removing vital fluids.? We have to grow oil, not drain it, as if end game is inconsequential.
891 2018-07-31 21:46:59 Stain on humanity, no oil, no help
892 2018-07-31 21:46:45 For silky hair, mix 3 parts olive oil and 1 part honey. Put in microwave 30 sec. Apply to damp hair 20 mins with shower cap on. Rinse well!
893 2018-07-31 21:46:40 Bio oil
894 2018-07-31 21:46:26 Sure I made it up! Roughly: 6 large tomatoes quartered (I used plum), one onion roughly chopped, one red pepper roughly chopped, 5 garlic cloves. Chuck in a roasting pan, drizzle with oil and season. Roast for 40 mins at 180. Remove and blend, adding water/stock if too thick 
895 2018-07-31 21:46:01 We can't, just because government is always looking at oil and gas sector.... Unnnn
896 2018-07-31 21:45:49 Anyone worse than a fuckboi? Yes, a guy who works at an auto shop/mechanic, because they just love to take your broke butt's money telling you it's $150 for an oil change 
Use google, ask a homie or another mechanic when in doubt. Trust no one 
897 2018-07-31 21:45:47 If oil companies could use that kind of fuel profitably, those fires would be out by now!  Of course if we burn off all the forests, and people who live there, fuel would be the least of our problems.
898 2018-07-31 21:45:44 Car wash. Oil change
899 2018-07-31 21:45:42 Truffle oil isn't even made of food. It's made of chemistry and voodoo.
900 2018-07-31 21:45:40 Really gonna hate when they can't destroy you. Then expect the royal treatment. Talkin slick like it's oil speakin. Down to earth, til my soil weaken. Venomous words, watching the poison leakin

904 2018-07-31 21:44:51 I love how her skin shines because of the oil/lotion!
905 2018-07-31 21:44:46 for post hair removal. Skin usually get dried out after hair removal so it puts all the moisture back not allowing the skin to get irritated & create bumps. 3. If you shave, do it with an oil. It makes the skin more supple and the hair more maleable for a closer shave.
906 2018-07-31 21:44:44 And lavender oil!
907 2018-07-31 21:44:38 Allah ya ansa masa, amma gwamna gida sai turanchi kawai

909 2018-07-31 21:44:22 Our evonomy is quite diverse. Look at every province without oil revenues they are all have not provinces maybe they have never thought about diversifying.
910 2018-07-31 21:44:21 Didn't @JustinTrudeau plan to phase out the oil sands and fossil fuels? Maybe that's not a bright idea...
911 2018-07-31 21:44:17 Woolworths organic coconut oil is my life. I live on that thing. For my hair,face, body. I love it!

921 2018-07-31 21:42:43 I have ideas, but it depends on how open you are to non culinary uses of olive oil and indoor paddling pool wrestling
922 2018-07-31 21:42:26 Late to the party again CBD Oil what the craic?

924 2018-07-31 21:41:52 So if the state doesn’t want oil or natural gas or coal exploration in their state they shouldn’t be able to stop it just because they want to? The states in question are where the majority of the population doesn’t want this States on the Great Lakes don’t want oil exploration
925 2018-07-31 21:41:43 Making the PENGEST roast veg selection, marinaded everything in fresh garlic, oil, smoky stock, chilli, Dijon mustard and red wine vinegar 
926 2018-07-31 21:41:39 Canadian workers deserve a climate strategy that divests from the oil industry and trains Canadians for the jobs of the future
927 2018-07-31 21:41:39 2am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
928 2018-07-31 21:41:38 2am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Oakland sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
929 2018-07-31 21:41:11 In the name of Climate Change, we strip our forrest now for: wind turbines, solar panels, wood pellets for biofuel generation, palm oil or sugar cane for transportation biofuel.  Environmental vandalism, criminal and stupidity...
930 2018-07-31 21:40:54 I know you’ve shared it before but I can’t remember where it is.... what oil do you use for chub rub? Garnier something ?

934 2018-07-31 21:40:19 And what does trump foundation do with money? Pay off legal settlements, purchase oil painting of trump, etc.  I guess we all know who understands the true meaning of charity and doing good for others.
935 2018-07-31 21:40:15 Oil was at $10 a barrel in 1999.  A lot easier to get a spread at $60 or $100 than at $10.
936 2018-07-31 21:40:13 エクストラバージンオイルってなんか卑猥だよね。
937 2018-07-31 21:40:02 I did slimming world. So usually poached egg and bacon on toast or overnight oats  baked potato and tuna or beans and for dinner pork loin steak with veg  and rice or spaghetti bol.  Just plenty veg and i use fry light instead of oil and take fat off meat
938 2018-07-31 21:39:59 Ever tried just using plain lemon slices as a scrub? Wet your skin first and slice a lemon into halves, then into quarter. Rub on your skin, let dry, repeat. You can to it off with the only product I found that works, Neutrogina retinol night cream. + Castor Oil.
939 2018-07-31 21:39:58 Plus tons of oil 
940 2018-07-31 21:39:47 The only essential oil I have is the WD40 I use to get into my dress pants.
941 2018-07-31 21:39:43 Without olive oil, life would be an even greater mistake ;)
942 2018-07-31 21:39:39 smart cats know that when 45 abolishes a crucial regulation, a famous mouse cries for mama #resist
943 2018-07-31 21:39:39 either way I DO like it quite a bit. you could toss a feedbag full of arugula with olive oil, salt and pepper at me and I would be happy. even better with some SKIRT STEAK on top
944 2018-07-31 21:39:38 Olive oil importers embrace criminality
945 2018-07-31 21:39:31 When he is supposed to be serving his constituents & country  of course. If he's selling snake oil of course. If he's manipulated the gullible of course.
946 2018-07-31 21:39:30 No! I won’t hear of that. It’s axle grease, not engine oil!
947 2018-07-31 21:39:28 I pray iTissue oil works on getting rid of the mark once it heals
948 2018-07-31 21:39:22 @soniachocron Hugo Chávez compro una serie de Plantas Eléctricas cuando el colapso del 2008, la gran mayoría trabajan con Diésel Oil. Tampoco tenemos combustibles diésel. Todas esas plantas están paradas
949 2018-07-31 21:39:16 Something cleaning up mother nature’s naturally occurring oil spill...? The dirtiest oil in North America comes from California any concerns with them still producing?
950 2018-07-31 21:39:12 Zambia is expensive when it comes to oil prices, Botswana and Lesotho might be cheaper - This is due to the tax system. We include a fuel levy, which is allocated to RAF and other initiatives. Botswana + Lesotho don't have such, not sure how good is that for people.
951 2018-07-31 21:39:05 Whew chile, why y’all ain’t tell me oil changes were this expensive
952 2018-07-31 21:39:04 It’s really good! Drizzle a little olive oil, add some shredded cheese and coarse salt. Yum. And I’m not vegan or vegetarian.
953 2018-07-31 21:39:01 I didn’t know it took 5 hours for an oil change 
954 2018-07-31 21:38:55 Pull up to get a oil change and 2 hours later they talkin bout I need 4 new tires, new air filter, & windshield wiper 
955 2018-07-31 21:38:45 Puffin is served with white sauce... still tastes like an old training shoe cooked in engine oil and marinaded in bad fish though...

960 2018-07-31 21:37:56 Not really sure that's why their scared.

The Warsaw Ghetto insurrection began with a single shot starter pistol.

The Liberator is the same deal.

If I were an Antifa-supporting Liberal Fascist, I'd be shit scared of a couple million Americans having that capability, too.
961 2018-07-31 21:37:56 I got superhot oil on my hand at work :)))))) still hurts
962 2018-07-31 21:37:54 hahaha. Good stuff.
963 2018-07-31 21:37:54 Oh I didn’t mean you did, it’s just always put me off the idea of using one. If you get smoked out in your kitchen it’s hard. Steak to room temp, season, oil in a pan with a few cloves of garlic/any other seasoning you like, as soon as it smokes 1/2
964 2018-07-31 21:37:35 Eating Rancid Vegetable Oil, such as safflower oil and sunflower oil, contain plenty of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) which oxidize easily in the presence of light, heat, or oxygen in the air. They can deplete your Vitamin-E and which protects the body from free radicals.

We love money, we work hard to make money, and we won't stick with brokeasses! If it's not good enough for you, stick to your yorubatic babes.

At least palm oil soup is cheaper than ofe Owerri!

974 2018-07-31 21:36:29 . Maybe instead of investing BILLIONS on an UNWANTED pipeline the Trudeau government could actually try fixing something for everyday Canadians not Texas-es elite oil barons. #cdnpoli

979 2018-07-31 21:35:58 Friends with essential oil diffusers...  Where do you buy your oils at?  Just curious.
980 2018-07-31 21:35:42 Ill be aggressively looking for liquid to sip in an ice capp like im trying to tap into an oil field

989 2018-07-31 21:35:01 My intention is for planes & bench chisels. I think the idea was to "moisten" the wheel with a light oil so the buffing compound bonds to wheel surface better.
990 2018-07-31 21:34:58  معلش بقا .. مش مهم اخدت بالي دلوقتي بس اشطا بردوو
991 2018-07-31 21:34:54 My old wheel was the felt type. I didn't condition that at all. The leather strop wheel was conditioned with a little mineral oil...just a smear enough to go around.
992 2018-07-31 21:34:52 How long have we been buying our fuel from the oil rich EU , I always thought it came from the middle east ?

995 2018-07-31 21:34:37 cut em in half, sprinkle on some salt, a little garlic, and drizzle with olive oil. Then roast those bitches till they're slightly burnt. Put whatever seasoning you want on them after, and they're actually good
996 2018-07-31 21:34:34 All I saw was motorboat. Shame on me....
997 2018-07-31 21:34:28 Some red lentils overnight. Bloom spices like turmeric coriander allspice maybe a little clove, in oil. Sauté minced garlic and onions and add ur lentils and confit them in ghee. It’s delicious
998 2018-07-31 21:34:25 The sustainably farmed sesame oil rice noodles is so fresh today!
999 2018-07-31 21:34:25 Use oil, coconut , olive, grapeseed etc when shaving coat your blades, it'll help with razor bumps. Also, use ole Vera gel afterwards for a few days but you must exfoliate first !! It really helps with ingrown hairs as well
1000 2018-07-31 21:34:25 Smack some baby oil on that and everyone’ll lose their minds man
1001 2018-07-31 21:34:25 Hmmm sheikh Yasir ibn Arafat
1002 2018-07-31 21:34:23 It’s tricky. In hyperinflation stocks will outperform bonds. Yes. Crack up boom. But a generic bond bear will be bad for both. Inflation and higher interest rates will be good for stuff & bad for paper. In 70’s bonds crushed, stocks churned. Except oil, real estate & gold stocks
1003 2018-07-31 21:34:05 Yo get your oil change at the very end of the day, they got this shit done in 30 minutes.
1004 2018-07-31 21:33:53 Those high-skill jobs of tomorrow: would that include coal? Polluting the lands, skies, and waters at will? How about destroying our irreplaceable parks for their minerals, oil, oh and more coal?
1005 2018-07-31 21:33:49 Let oil rich Arab countries come to their rescue. Half a world away, we don’t need to take responsibility for their screwed up country.

1008 2018-07-31 21:33:33 nothing like getting an oil change after work and getting hit on by 4 dirty ass men
1009 2018-07-31 21:33:17 UBI is communist snake oil. Don’t be fooled. The purpose is to have us all dependent on the state. Slowly wages will deflate but don’t worry the UBI element will compensate. Then we are on the hook. Step out of line with the Gov and they can pull the plug on your UBI.

1013 2018-07-31 21:32:40 use olive oil to shave instead of shaving cream! let the oil soak in for a minute and then shave with the grain, and then side to side to get any hairs you missed. exfoliate after and use as much olive oil as needed! it’s the best method!!! 
1014 2018-07-31 21:32:36 Oga wants to build cattle ranch in Edo state which is an oil producing state but conversely wants to build a refinery in Katsina which is a cattle rearing state.I think integrity and vision is far from this Govt.

 It didn’t work in Cuba, Russia, China is oppressive, Nicaragua, Venezuela. Look at Africa in term oil, Middle East term oil.  Everyone wants to come to America but no one wants to go back to any of these nations.

1046 2018-07-31 21:29:30 А действително ли имат постоянен ефект? Аз си взех Clear Oil Control (жълтия), с надеждата да се справи с проблема ефикасно, но всъщност ако не я мия с него и с катранен сапун, всичко си е пак по старому. Косата ми е плътна и гъста, предполагам, че затова така ми става.
1047 2018-07-31 21:29:27 Everton gotten an oil field in Merseyside?
1048 2018-07-31 21:29:14 Hi there, many thanks for your reply. I live in Leytonstone, but was asking about Islington as I often meet friends there. I think Leytonstone’s a bit too far for you to hand deliver (!), so I can just order some of your CBD oil online. Many thanks. Laura
1049 2018-07-31 21:29:05 I was shared a room with a girl that only used fish oil products for her hair and for body cleansing.  After a week, I had to get a different roommate.  Felt like I was being catfished.  #tuna me not
1050 2018-07-31 21:29:05 Does anybody take cbd oil by mouth? I just ordered some and I have a few questions 
1051 2018-07-31 21:29:03 atleast you're not rapping about money that is your boss' and renting cars to trick other countries into thinking you're still relevant; or into thinking you are an oil tycoon... there's always that plus... boom
1052 2018-07-31 21:28:01 Universal basic income is paid for from the profits of resources that belong to all of us that are currently harvested by corporations like water, oil, forestry products, Etc. Exxon does not own the oil in the ground, we all do that shared profit alone would fund this.
1053 2018-07-31 21:27:53 As an environmental scientist, I think the oil industry is FANTASTIC!

1059 2018-07-31 21:26:39 Will be difficult for any Chinese firms to import that oil as they immediately open themselves up for sanctions if they want to do anything touching US or partners. Tankers won't carry. China also reaching out KSA for business. We'll see.
1060 2018-07-31 21:26:37 and wat do u look like bet your no oil painting
1061 2018-07-31 21:26:29 Yeah gotta a sad point there. Some bans limited business too much but we gotta respect the earth, land, wildlife. Oil pipeline sucks also 
1062 2018-07-31 21:26:28 I use this company. CBD is always better with a little THC but this is a good start. You can use the powder mixed with some coconut oil to make your own tincture. I have two herniated discs and this stuff is a blessing. I also mix with some tigers balm for a good muscle rub.
1063 2018-07-31 21:26:20 The best way is to rub it in oil and some salt (however much you like) before you bake it, makes the skin crispy and salty and ooohhhh so good!
1064 2018-07-31 21:26:16 Trump is aiming to cut spending in all of those areas. If the US isn't paying to protect the EU from the same Russia they buy all their oil from, isn't paying to protect Japan and isn't caught in endless wars in the middle east, they can cut military spending.
1065 2018-07-31 21:26:10 Nah nah.. Natural oils are the best biko. Tea tree oil or olive oil for me.
1066 2018-07-31 21:26:04 Try CBD oil. Its legal and doesnt get you high, just relaxes you
1067 2018-07-31 21:25:55 Agreed. But! What we are doing is not allowing America to become a country in which oil companies come to hide from lawsuits. #Tillerson #FriendToRussia

1075 2018-07-31 21:24:10 Master everybody is busy checking on $APPL earnings while a few TPLaddicts like me read about a boring land business involved in the oil industry that happens to grow EPS more than 217% with an NI margin of 71% and has been around since 1888... that is why the opportunity exists
1076 2018-07-31 21:24:00 What about a vegan peanut & vanilla frosting? Or peanut & banana? Or a raw cream cheese made with cashews, coconut oil , honey & vanilla? Or a blend of medjool dates, cashews and vanilla ?

1080 2018-07-31 21:23:41 Give him a hug from Canada. Pharmaceutical companies knew the problems that opioids cause and pushed them to the tune of billions in profit.

1083 2018-07-31 21:23:24 $NFX - sizable beat, analysts may twitch over oil cut but it's more gas and NGL's, not less oil, oil was spot on in the Anadarko. See site for comments.

1084 2018-07-31 21:23:23 Like I said. A solid oil and gas industry is spite of government.
1085 2018-07-31 21:23:12 @Money23Green has those @StephenCurry30 muscles on the court but off the court it's more like Olive Oil.
1086 2018-07-31 21:23:03 He was charismatic, a smooth-talking, silvertongued, snake oil salesman... he knew he was going to sell us out from the beginning, he's a card-carrying Muslim Brotherhood, Sharia law loving, caliphate endorsing, America hating such and such.
1087 2018-07-31 21:22:45 I'm also furious that scientific evidence shows that CBD oil has a good effect on pain for animals, especially dogs and yet our lousy politicians can't even get over themselves enough to allow use to care for our fur babies this way.  Even the UK allows it for animals.
1088 2018-07-31 21:22:28 My car oil is being changed so now I don’t have to worry about dying suddenly. Or whatever.

1090 2018-07-31 21:22:03 As an intellectual exercise, differentiating between these groups may be stimulating. Practically, I never saw much difference from one to another in a lot of cases.  They shift more than the sand they live on.
1091 2018-07-31 21:22:00 when ur Taco Bell order costs more than your oil change..
1092 2018-07-31 21:21:44 You have to make sure you're getting extra virgin olive oil cuz the regular olive oil is almost always gonna be cut. Pay attention to where it's produced. Last time I checked, Costco's brand was quite good.
1093 2018-07-31 21:21:44 He’s no oil painting to start with
1094 2018-07-31 21:21:40 When you knowingly hitch your wagon to a snake oil salesman, you have to make hay while the sun shines because it's hard to fish or cut bait while the rising tide only floats certain boats. If you get my drift.

1097 2018-07-31 21:21:17 I know. There have more some administrations who have done some really stupid things in the name of oil, the word “minority” and/or the concept of freedom of religion. They only looked at the surface of their decisions without really understanding the true issues at stake.

1130 2018-07-31 21:17:14 ههههههههههه بضحك معاك متعملهاش  ذعله
1131 2018-07-31 21:17:13 Oh you taking the oil with you 
1132 2018-07-31 21:17:06 If they can sort me out, oil see if there's another one if you like?
1133 2018-07-31 21:16:57 Oil Man drinks his milkshake.
1134 2018-07-31 21:16:49 I have ...from CNBC

"China, the largest importer, has not taken a position. In the last round of sanctions, China continued to buy oil from Iran, using a company that dealt with a bank with no connection to the U.S. banking system."

The US is powerful but it's not the world.
1135 2018-07-31 21:16:44 PROS FOR WARM WATER: 
-washes away dirt, and oil build up better
- relieves muscle soreness and stiffness 
-best for washing off a deep cold 
- lowers stress level
- very calming and relaxing especially when taking a bath
1136 2018-07-31 21:16:22 @swiftcover so I pay my home insurance with added home emergency cover, yet as I have an oil boiler, you don’t have many engineers covering the U.K, so now I have to wait until Thursday to get hot water, when I have a 10 month old baby to bath??
1137 2018-07-31 21:16:18 Ouch! RIGHT ON THE MONEY! What’s crazy to me is that both sides of the coin are clearly the exact same yet far too many still think one is a face & the other is the tail, when the whole coin is the slimy snake pissing this “said” oil. Why can only some see this? Ugly truth thing?
1138 2018-07-31 21:16:14 Yes fix them so their friends can drill for oil, and strip mine for precious metals. The trump Admin. has removed for economic reasons more protected lands than any other Pres. possibly combined. I don't have time to check that one.
1139 2018-07-31 21:16:14 hard to swallow pill: fish oil
1140 2018-07-31 21:16:08 Yup. Tons of garbage out there. To even call most of them Olive Oil is a scam.

Hell, pump that stuff out and I'll probably buy it myself - if the price is right.
1141 2018-07-31 21:15:32 can you change the oil on my car so i don’t have to pay $96 at my local mechanic

2. EXTRACTS - cannabis concentrates like hash oil, wax & shatter
3. TOPICALS - cannabis-infused creams, lotions & balms  
4. EDIBLES - any food or beverage infused with cannabis
1143 2018-07-31 21:15:10 If there’s one element/spice that I love on all my food, it’s definitely Asian sauces and pastes. I went buckwildin’ st @HmartOfficial on 110th. I was like lemme get some 

-red pepper in chili oil 
-fried chili in oil

1149 2018-07-31 21:14:28 I think getting the mechanism open would be exponentially harder than lubricating it, especially since it's hugely exposed on both sides & applying shock oil is thus incredibly easy
1150 2018-07-31 21:14:24 What goods does Nigeria export to USA except crude oil?
1151 2018-07-31 21:14:24 Got my oil changed and looked at an apartment today so i treated myself by buying clothes :)
1152 2018-07-31 21:14:15 @ColumbiaAuto Thanks for the great service. Oil change, recall service, courtesy wash, and even a surprise wiper fix at the end. I will recommend you to anyone that owns a vehicle old or new. #happycustomer #greatservice

1154 2018-07-31 21:14:10 Actually I've come to a realization -- we call our 1 cat a pet slut because she'll let anyone pet her!  I guess I'm a pot slut cuz I'll smoke any strain in any form -- flower, oil, wax, shatter, budder, rosin, edibles, tinctures, rub, and capsule form!

1156 2018-07-31 21:13:42 I mean, I've had to skip out on some engine oil cleans because I just didn't have the money, but I still try to take decent care of my car. That's just poor maintenance.
1157 2018-07-31 21:13:40 I do this thing when I get a gift card where I just want to go shopping every day until I find something nice, but it’s hard to tell myself I really don’t need olive oil from Marshall’s
1158 2018-07-31 21:13:31 The best essential oil combination, bar none, is orange and vanilla.
1159 2018-07-31 21:13:23 No clue about Nigeria's politics.

But can safely say it is definately a Leadership issue, other than oil prices.

What's $6bn and $8bn for them?
They can recover this overnight by manipulating oil production & prices !
1180 2018-07-31 21:09:44 @rhiannonashlee Which essential oil diffuser do you have? I really want one but there’s so much choice!
1181 2018-07-31 21:09:21 Scotland has a huge energy surplus - we don't need nuclear at all.  Shut them down, it's not as if we'll be losing profits.  Well, not until Indy but by then we'll have 98% of current uk oil sales and all our other revenues available to cover the loss.

Going to be some party!
1182 2018-07-31 21:09:18 In all honesty I don’t agree with a lot of things our president says or does, but I work in the oil and gas Industry and since he has been in office a lot of good people who lost there jobs during the last administration are back to being able to support there families.
1183 2018-07-31 21:09:15 QE4 was Titled: JCPOA - was designed to, and did, collapse oil prices providing worldwide stimulus.
1184 2018-07-31 21:09:07 Do u trade Crude or Oil equities?
1185 2018-07-31 21:09:03 Aye but don't worry. Whenever we vote YES to independence that will all change because the oil will run out and the sky will fall! #VOTEYES

1187 2018-07-31 21:08:45 My knowledge is limited but in my experience working at a zaibatsu, it's probably just because Japanese business resists change like oil resists water.

1192 2018-07-31 21:08:19 For shiny and healthy hair, mash up an avocado, mix it with a tbsp of olive oil and rub it through your hair. Wash after 15 mins.
1193 2018-07-31 21:08:14 Went to get my oil changed like not a barbarian and they don’t have a filter lol but yay free oil top up until tomorrow
1194 2018-07-31 21:08:12 Well done. BBC balance agenda should have a cut off at 70/30 for against. Climate change has been proven for decades only big oil sponsored scientists believe otherwise.

Even olive oil doesn't help
1198 2018-07-31 21:07:23 Lmao my dude, fighting in oil wars doesn’t somehow exempt you from basic human decency. If you think that some Americans don’t deserve health care you don’t get to also pretend your sacrifices were in any way for their benefit.
1199 2018-07-31 21:07:18 WHO SAYS BUHARI IS NOT A LEADER?

He wants to Build refineries in the North, while crude oil is in Southern Zoo. 
And build cattle Ranches in Southern Nigeria, for cattle whose owners are Fulani terrorists from Northern Zoo!!!

1203 2018-07-31 21:06:51 Yeah maybe when more research is completed then we might be able to use renewables but it’s prohibitively expensive now. Coal, nuclear, and oil is unfortunately the only alternative we have at the moment.
1204 2018-07-31 21:06:38 Tea tree oil works but I actually have a metal allergy and even stainless steel irritated while it was still healing. Try switching to titanium until it's fully healed!

1215 2018-07-31 21:05:08 Remember this fact: 
1.5% Surplus of oil dropped oil to $26 in 2014.

A 6-7% Shortage of available oil in 2020 would do what to Oil prices?

Lack of Exploration Offshore, 
Lack of investment since 2014 in drilling 
has set up a scenario for such a shortage in early 2020's

1250 2018-07-31 21:00:13 Here’s an idea. Men used to wear smoking jackets. Start an “eating jacket” trend. It will keep oil off your shirt, ketchup off your sleeve, and coffee off your lap. With its patented design and breathable fabrics, of course.
1251 2018-07-31 21:00:09 I remember one of the first things the Reagan Revolution White House did was to remove the solar panels Jimmy Carter had installed. A silent signal to the oil industry that America would not go with alternative to fossil fuel (except nuclear!).

1267 2018-07-31 20:59:08 U.S. oil production continues to set records. Over the past two weeks, American crude oil production has hit 11 million bpd after having sustained production of 10.9 million bpd over the previous four weeksU
1268 2018-07-31 20:59:08 Between cocoa butter and coconut oil, you can cover about 90% of hair, skin and nail concerns imo.
1269 2018-07-31 20:59:04 Oh! Is it processing while spraying sand or oil?
1270 2018-07-31 20:58:59 My name is Sergio. I’m 28 and don’t know how to do an oil change for my car.
1271 2018-07-31 20:58:53 Democrats, please do not give your money or votes to a person like Gillibrand who tries to trick you into fearing something that won't happen.  She is a modern day snake oil salesperson.  You deserve better.
1272 2018-07-31 20:58:50 Ok so skin in that region is sensitive. Men shave their faces and get razor bumps so if a woman shaved her pubic hair guess what it she will get razor bumps. Nothing that some coco oil of shea butter can’t fix. Yo sometimes yall are severe on the feminine gender.
1273 2018-07-31 20:58:50 Yeah, I often add a dash of ginger oil into the mix if the meat is less fatty. Gives a nice spike of that something. If it is a bit tougher sort of meat, I also put in a dash of ketjap manis for a flavor boost.
1274 2018-07-31 20:58:32 And the goal seems to be to block sunlight and move water (as rain). Idk why but maybe the oil industry against solar? Or to release water for fracking?
1275 2018-07-31 20:58:32 The shampoo yallrare using is probably too strong and is stripping the scalp of oily so you’re body is working double time to replace the oil
1276 2018-07-31 20:58:29 i dropped my car off w my dad and it came back w an oil change, car wash, and full tank of gas :)
1277 2018-07-31 20:57:55 Suggest people not start to jump up & down thinking all is wonderful. Every year we run on a cycle starting in the spring but many projected positive results start disappearing in August especially if Bank of Canada held back on rate increase. We are very lucky with oil & gas now
1278 2018-07-31 20:57:36 All I wanna do is go home take a nap n binge watch elementary but no I gotta get a oil change than do more errand man I’m so sick of being responsible
1279 2018-07-31 20:57:36 #WW1OnThisDay 1917 31/7 3rd Ypres: XVIII Corps attacked at 3:50am with a trench mortar barrage of burning oil cans. 51 Highland Div & 39 Div attacked towards Langemarck & St Julien from NW of Wieltje.
1280 2018-07-31 20:57:32 100% American awesomeness, that's what.
1281 2018-07-31 20:57:30 Truly a miss carriage of justice when big oil can buy a backroom deal to approve a pipeline via flawed environmental assessment and consultation. Compounded when a selfrightious prosecutor asserts the rest of us have to obey rules big oil and Trudeau don't honor.
1282 2018-07-31 20:57:25 Of course, the usage of words depends on context. For example, I would not object to someone saying "progress towards dealing with global climate change has been retarded by oil sands development."
1283 2018-07-31 20:57:22 あまりにも危険すぎる存在ですよ…
1284 2018-07-31 20:57:19 Lmao

Marathon Oil of Findlay, OHIO owns Ashland Inc.

1287 2018-07-31 20:57:02 Japan’s imports of Iranian oil increased by 10 percent in June compared to the same month last year, Japan’s trade ministry data showed. Japan, however, is said to be preparing to stop Iranian oil imports to comply with U.S. demands that it completely stop buying crude from Iran.
1288 2018-07-31 20:56:48 Lmao your cute,, oil!!!
1289 2018-07-31 20:56:45 They do not deserve praise because of thus the koch' are still fighting like hell to shoot down public transit choking our streets and air for their oil profits they deserve nothing from the people they helped rob.
1290 2018-07-31 20:56:41 I am pro-draft if it means that the women and children of this country would die to a forien force.. yes.. But not for some political agenda of owning a country with oil.. I am never pro/against anything.. I think everything in life has situations..
1291 2018-07-31 20:56:37 South Korea’s imports from Iran plunged by 41 percent to 183,000 bpd in June compared to June 2017. Starting in July, South Korea is halting Iranian oil imports for the first time since 2012 amid pressure from the United States
1292 2018-07-31 20:56:35 Lavender oil really helps with insomnia

1295 2018-07-31 20:56:18 This oil tho 
1296 2018-07-31 20:56:17 step 1: mix the vaseline, olive oil, and lip balm
step 2: add the sugar to the mix
step 3: add into the container
YOUR DONE!!
1297 2018-07-31 20:56:12 Knowledge is like oil in a car engine: necessary for driving, yet insufficient.
1298 2018-07-31 20:56:03 Well with the President recently visiting oil producing countries ( Saudi Arabia, UAE and Nigeria), I'm sure that there are plans in place to avert the net effect on poor people ( because of the oil price hike).
1299 2018-07-31 20:55:59 Indian oil imports jumped by almost 20 percent on the year in June. Yet, compared to May, when the U.S. said it would re-impose sanctions on Iran, Indian oil refiners reduced their orders for Iranian crude oil in June by 12 percent,

1306 2018-07-31 20:55:25 Iran’s largest oil customer—China—saw its Iranian imports increase by nearly 2 percent on the year to around 525,000 bpd in June, according to Reuters oil flow data. China not expected to halt shipments from Tehran when U.S. sanctions kick in later this year.
1307 2018-07-31 20:55:18 The Crown Prince is cleaning out his swamp too. Their oil is drying up.
1308 2018-07-31 20:55:16 My current fav is sesame oil (the regular kind, not the toasted kind), soy sauce (Kikkoman, not tamari, you need the depth), a lot of ginger garlic paste. OMG it is amazing on grilled beef. I'm thinking it would be better on gym rats--leaner muscle.

1310 2018-07-31 20:54:52 Some big Indian refiners worry that their access to the U.S. financial system could be cut off if they continue to import Iranian oil, and have started to reduce purchases from Tehran.

1313 2018-07-31 20:54:21 We need to stop shipping oil to the US, stop letting them ship coal through B.C,  and start building pipelines for oil and LNG.

1316 2018-07-31 20:53:58 Hi, esthetician in training! Witch hazel can be drying to some& coconut oil has the tendency to clog pores. Use a balancing cleanser, tone with rose water after, & use a water based moisturizer if you’re oily, or a facial oil such as rosehip or argan if you’re dry :)
1317 2018-07-31 20:53:55 I use 6B pencil for sketching/lines and I use oil paint for painting!
1318 2018-07-31 20:53:50 The drawings for the AR-15 are available and some of the dimensions are the +/- .005 range. That is hard to do.
1319 2018-07-31 20:53:35 Before I went to school I used coconut oil as my moisturizer and a makeup remover but then learned all the harm is can cause for the skin. For hair tho, it’s amazing!!
1320 2018-07-31 20:53:34 top Asian oil importers and Iranian oil customers—China, India, Japan, and South Korea—bought in June their lowest combined volume of Iranian oil in seven month
1321 2018-07-31 20:53:20 Rand will tank tomorrow morning

Thereby making oil price more expensive in Rand terms

Meaning petrol price increase

They could have done this better
No decent plan going forward
1322 2018-07-31 20:53:19 Sharpie also makes white oil based paint pens, water resistant and dries in about 2 mins.
1323 2018-07-31 20:53:14 Hmmm, not sure China has given that message.  Sounds more like China will not entertain the approach the US has taken period unless US backtracks.  Also it seems a bit much for China to give up cheap oil the will be hard pressed to find elsewhere.
1324 2018-07-31 20:53:05 Getting into oil painting and am mad that I can’t colour match perfectly. Why Bitch why.
1325 2018-07-31 20:53:03 Flour, salt, yeast. Mix it all together. Add water & olive oil until it's a doughy consistency, then knead. That's seriously all you need.
1326 2018-07-31 20:52:58 Fellow Etsy here too I completely agree!! I know some peeps who love witch hazel and it’s a good add in to a toner but def not on its own. Coconut oil has been so controversial as a skin care item as well. OAs it can work for others and can cause terrible breakouts.
1327 2018-07-31 20:52:45 I don't have much dairy tbh, so don't think it's that. I think the worst thing is trying to pin point what's causing it/ then trying to prevent any more. They're just so sore and red. I don't think I've got the jasmine oil. I've got the rose tonic.x
1328 2018-07-31 20:52:44 Jones Oil absolutely breaks it off in Eastern Kentucky people. I can drive to Grundy and gas is 40 cents less.

1330 2018-07-31 20:52:31 I did mention only two factors, with regards to the reason in fuel hikes. Some other reasons, for the recent event include( but not limited to): the current situation in Venezuela; and the re-imposed sanctions on Iran(worlds 5th largest oil exporter) by the US.
1331 2018-07-31 20:52:29 Have these people on twitter asking for money never heard of the Permian shale play!? You're living in the greatest country on earth with oil exports wide open / production costs at an all time low and you're stuck in fuckin Clearwater Florida! LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
1332 2018-07-31 20:52:24 Dearth of investments in oil projects mean a spike in prices above $100 could be on the horizon. Pierre Andurand is betting on a multi year bull run in oil. Mr. Andurand said Brent could hit highs of $100 a barrel 2018 and top $150 by the early 2020s.
1333 2018-07-31 20:52:18 Except that there's precedent for why (and how) to break up companies that are too big - Standard Oil, Bell, others?
1334 2018-07-31 20:52:17 Weekly US oil numbers are & have been suspect, but it's noise. The number to watch is global demand going over 100 million bpd. That's why you own deep value international small/micro cap producers with some upstream juice. It's the option that never expires. Be right & sit tight
1335 2018-07-31 20:52:03 USD API Weekly Crude Oil Stock diumumkan : 5.590M sebelumnya : -3.160M

1338 2018-07-31 20:51:27 "Here's what's REALLY in your food" posts confuse me. All of those ingredients in the McDonald's fries are oils they use to fry, compounds to prevent freezerburn, and coatings to produce crispiness without the oil bubbling over in big batches. None of them are out of the ordinary
1339 2018-07-31 20:51:24 The US.

Why?  They have oil they don't want to sell to us, they are going to nationalize it. "Can't have that."
1340 2018-07-31 20:51:11 I am an oil man
1341 2018-07-31 20:51:09 What the fuck are you talking about? Has nothing to do with the house of Saud. Renewables don’t work as well as oil does.  They’re more expensive and does not power things as well as oil or nuclear. End of story
1342 2018-07-31 20:51:05 Hey Joe! Do you ship to Bulgaria? Im in need of CBD oil and the doctor prescribed me Xanax which I really dont want to put into my system. I still smoke here which helps but have to be exra careful with copsas its stil illegal.. Anyways, u have any idea if CBD oil is legal in BG
1343 2018-07-31 20:51:03 To be clear, you are advocating for an end to ALL energy subsidies, including the subsidies enjoyed by the energy companies paying your salary (oil, gas, coal, nuclear)? TPPF only seems interested in ending subsidies for renewables. If you want to end all of them, well done!
1344 2018-07-31 20:50:54 Late night thought before bed... why are people still eating nutella when the main ingredient is palm oil which is one of the largest deforestation scandals of our current climate crisis?

1348 2018-07-31 20:50:25 @realDonaldTrump Hello Mr. Trump. Iraq has so much in the ground. They need help and inspiration on getting their natural resources out of the ground and to market., Including more oil out of the ground.  They also need help on their electrical needs. Electrician of 35 years.
1349 2018-07-31 20:50:06 It is a most miraculous drupe... we use the oil extensively and I love the smell and the taste of coconut. Yum
1350 2018-07-31 20:50:05 Much of the magazine seems too much like snake oil salesmanship. 90% of the developments listed aren't noteworthy, they're badly designed & don't embrace the history or architecture of Medway. Kitchener is the only development in several decades that I have hope for.
1351 2018-07-31 20:49:55 Have you tried the pixi jasmine oil? That’s been really helping mine, and cutting down on dairy xx
1352 2018-07-31 20:49:44 Tfw you bring a bottle of wine to your bedside but it turns out you grabbed the olive oil instead
1353 2018-07-31 20:49:33 Usually trains pull 100-125 full cars, at least that's what they used to do with grain cars. Just think sometimes those cars have acid, anhydrous ammonia and things even nicer than oil going basically under Calgary tower

1361 2018-07-31 20:48:22 But still its unlikely that the uk would of stayed in a 1960s state in the long term things may of happened differently but recovery would of happened north sea oil & gas would of guaranteed some recovery on their own. & the uk was hardly a third world country even at its worse

1365 2018-07-31 20:48:01 Ummm, hello....I’m here for a prostate exam. Not an “Oil Change”!!! 
1366 2018-07-31 20:47:59 The irony of Conservatives not wanting to get our oil to market.
1367 2018-07-31 20:47:58 But if you change the word “oil” and use anything else that surround you, here you have how to spread fake news an ideology. Great analysis. Thx.
1368 2018-07-31 20:47:46 You won't get banned as long as y'all don't post stuff like this drawing attention from people who weren't looking for it in the first place. #Flagrant2 gotta be grass roots. Word of mouth like a Snake Oil vender.
1369 2018-07-31 20:47:40 Fundamental analysts, and chartists right now  are simply baffled, right now about the long term price for oil. We are in for a % Dip first week in August. Then perhaps a big reversal and Brent is headed to $80 and WTI mid 70's. Wait and see
1370 2018-07-31 20:47:38 I’m enjoying extra toasted Ezekiel’s bread smothered in honey & coconut oil  while my 18 month old naps 
1371 2018-07-31 20:47:24 Hahahahaha.. no it went with evening primrose oil internally and a witch hazel wash and then comfrey topically! I hadn't discovered the miracle moss at that point. Pmsl
1372 2018-07-31 20:47:23 My exgf took me out to a Hibatchi place this past sunday and I asked the chef for spaghetti and he squirted me with the oil and then threw a piece of egg at me. XD
1373 2018-07-31 20:47:18 Oil on. Anvas?
1374 2018-07-31 20:47:15 Coconut oil and olive oil are wonderful oils.  Flax oil should be good as well
1375 2018-07-31 20:46:49 The thing is, it's not the greens. They are simply loving the doomsday scenarios as they get more airtime and donations. It's the govt subsidies allowing mining and engineering industries to profit. The oil companies know their product will always be needed.
1376 2018-07-31 20:46:37 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
1377 2018-07-31 20:46:32 Hi Gorgeous x

If not, let's order in jalapeno pepperami chilli pizza

1380 2018-07-31 20:46:07 People assuming its a scam by the greens often say "follow the money" - which I think is weird because the money always seems to lead back to oil. Sorry to switch and go on here but we've been trading graphs for months now and its kind of going nowhere. \4
1381 2018-07-31 20:45:57 Check your Engine oil this Sunday.
1382 2018-07-31 20:45:55 yeah my mom is always telling me to put oil on mine so i do and i wake up looking like i haven’t washed t in MONTHS
1383 2018-07-31 20:45:43 Time you expand your production and make the farmers provide you with cropps for Ethan! OPEC oil is expensive and ethanol is cheaper for car fuel!
1384 2018-07-31 20:45:41 Corbyn and his Labour Leadership, what's not to like?
He puts Public ownership before Private profiteers.
He puts public welfare before Corporate welfare.
He puts decent jobs and wages before shareholders profit.
He puts peace & the environment before war, oil fields and fracking
1385 2018-07-31 20:45:32 Soak it with some olive oil. It'll dissolve most of the glue making it easier to peel off
1386 2018-07-31 20:45:28 like giving Palestine "back" to the Post WW2 Israelis, without any Oil?

1387 2018-07-31 20:45:20 That’s the plan once we get home. I had to drive into Tucson to get the oil changed in my car.
1388 2018-07-31 20:45:11 Well, avocados and coconut oil, etc. work too 
1389 2018-07-31 20:45:05 'brent futures' sounds so much like the name of a time-travelling superhero that it physically pains me to inform you that it's actually a global oil market thing
1390 2018-07-31 20:44:06 ... maybe i should just pour pure tea tree oil onto them
1391 2018-07-31 20:44:03 Considering that most olive oil sold in the US is total horseshit, this could be a solid move.
1392 2018-07-31 20:43:48 Nope you have to go through plants to get those jobs. It's listed as the oil field and plants. But some one has to do the little jobs to keep them up to code its all about what you know
1393 2018-07-31 20:43:46 It's amazing: oil has fallen, but #Surgutneftegas is actively buying. #SGGD
1394 2018-07-31 20:43:41 < completely wrong to be cautious. 
Who knows, he might be even totally right, and then I’m the suicidal idiot.
I produce a pan and occupy another stove segment, leaving it there with oil to heat up while I >
1395 2018-07-31 20:43:40 my grandma told my aunt to buy me CBD oil when my aunt and i decided she would just pay me back and now i guess i own a ton of CBD oil and im down $30
1396 2018-07-31 20:43:38 Got my baby Callie and cleaned up showered and oil changed today. 
1397 2018-07-31 20:43:32 Private and Public don’t mix just like Water and Oil 
1398 2018-07-31 20:43:22 Bleak. Strike oil. foresake relationships.
1399 2018-07-31 20:43:19 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
1400 2018-07-31 20:43:14 The tragedy - as you'll agree - is that we're arguing over the state of the environment - which has no political affiliation and will do whatever it does regardless. We both believe there's a scam going on - you'd say by the greens and I'd say by the oil companies \3
1401 2018-07-31 20:43:14 The funny mugs and drinkware! Also funny beverage cookies. The olive oil detangling spray also works wonders!
1402 2018-07-31 20:43:10 Just change my oil
1403 2018-07-31 20:43:00 Oil biz sharpies try to buy bay, but get owned by Scottish hermit. @CharlesPPierce
1404 2018-07-31 20:42:59 "Cdn crude comes with a significant price discount compared to global oil prices. This is the cost ... of essentially selling to only one foreign market." Erm, no, that's not why.
1405 2018-07-31 20:42:55 I have no idea
1406 2018-07-31 20:42:44 Yes, and I bet they paid some snake oil "brand consultant" hundreds of thousands for that "C".
1407 2018-07-31 20:42:42 ."Evangelist/Televangelist" equates to traveling salesman selling snake oil to gullible marks and are no more "Christian" than the Trumps.
1408 2018-07-31 20:42:36 Because if you force poor nations too solely use renewables they will not be able to afford it. Renewables don’t yet have the efficacy of oil.
1409 2018-07-31 20:42:13 try oil :)
1410 2018-07-31 20:42:13 Sad news, someone needs to tell him to try Cannabis Oil, what has he got to lose?
1411 2018-07-31 20:42:12 Y'all.. bear with me for a sec.. but I recently discovered coconut oil body mist, and goddamn. This shit is wild. I smell deliciously fresh AND get to flaunt my silky smooth skin!? Why has this secret been kept from me for so long?
1412 2018-07-31 20:42:12 I hope it’s beef and pork and not... you know... dog
1413 2018-07-31 20:42:05 Cut it thinly and lightly fry in coconut oil if you want it crispy (3 mins), hot oil stops it sticking to frying pan. Or cut chunky and boil it in soup/ curry/ stew etc (15 mins) or bake it in casserole, lasagna (35mins). It doesn't take long.
1414 2018-07-31 20:41:57 Here are a few tweets on Kansas oil production.

Kansas is headed toward its 4th straight year of production declines. It's on pace to produce 34.5 million barrels, the lowest since 2005.

There are many reasons, but a big one is the price of oil.

1424 2018-07-31 20:41:03 If it is not bullish nobody cares.  That's the problem when 99% want higher oil prices.
1425 2018-07-31 20:40:54 One time things? How so? Walmart is handing to us every year cost for subsidizing their labor cost. Oil subsidies are yearly. Farm subsidies yearly. Corporate tax loopholes yearly.
1426 2018-07-31 20:40:51 mejor put manteca on my hair and get it over with. my wife actually had my put this growth oil... made it WORSE. I went two weeks letting the oil build up and just rinsing it off with water... it felt soooo GROSS. never doing it again.
1427 2018-07-31 20:40:38 You lost because the snp were dishonest on what was on offer,sharing the pound,basing the economy on a volatile oil price,they're a bunch of conmen,they should be ashamed on the way they lied to get independence.
No wonder we won,we're not all gullible and fell for the lies.

1435 2018-07-31 20:40:02 I recently met an old friend from college. She turned out to be a staunch Trump supporter. She asked me "What does it say to you liberals that we Republicans were so thirsty for leadership, we drank Trump's 'snake oil'?"
I replied, "You don't drink the snake oil cuz you're

1440 2018-07-31 20:38:43 @realDonaldTrump  Guess who f*ked up~? U.S. sanctions on Iran that will come into force later this year will force a decline in Iranian oil exports, so supply fears, US-China trade spat, plus demand from Asia are all helping shore up oil prices.

1448 2018-07-31 20:37:31 Sure that’s not fancy olive oil? Square bottles aren’t for wine!
1449 2018-07-31 20:37:27 I use tea-tree oil mixed with coconut oil after I manscape. It helps a lot. Aloe works good too.
1450 2018-07-31 20:37:04 We don't own oil reserves(not anymore, anyway), we import oil from oil producing countries. Oil prices are determined by international oil prices and also the rand/dollar exchange, to name a few contributing factors.
1451 2018-07-31 20:36:27 Oh, please. What else is Putin going to say with Trump right there, in front of a rabidly Trump-hating media-especially after Trump had just tried to get Merkel to scuttle her pipeline to Russia in favor of American oil?
1452 2018-07-31 20:36:21 The demand for oil will increase through 2035. We would generate royalties and tax revenues for oil produced in Canada which benefits all Canadians. For $50 billion, you can build a refinery in Canada. Or make more money selling it as dilbit and create tech jobs to diversify.

1454 2018-07-31 20:36:16 Tens of billions in capital investment have flooded out of Alberta to places like Africa, Russia and South America.  Oil firms cite difficult regulatory environment and anti-business sentiment as the reasons why.  This is caused by your ideology and related policies.
1455 2018-07-31 20:36:16 Mexico spent about 13.8 billion pesos ($740 million) in the first half of 2018 from its budget stabilization fund, which historically has been used exclusively to hedge forward oil prices.
1456 2018-07-31 20:36:15 And you know which country else will profit if the oil prices go up?

1458 2018-07-31 20:35:46 July was a very productive month. Enjoyed some profits, but the real gain came from experiencing different market conditions and seeing my emotional output change as I've increased the sizing of my trades. Will devote a video: trades included will be BTC, soy, oil as examples.
1459 2018-07-31 20:35:46 Can't really answer that as your view is that without uk joining the eu it would have become an everlasting hell hole, this would be unlikely in the long term, uk had fertile land oil & gas coal excellent higher education & skilled industries aerospace etc so would likely recover

1486 2018-07-31 20:33:04 Renewable energy exists. In fact, the very nature of renewable energy means that it's always existed. If this were considered a priority we wouldn't be going to war for the better part of a century over oil.
1487 2018-07-31 20:32:57 I'll start taking. I'm a bit worried I've not stored the oil right. It has flaxseed in it too. So may be fucked now. I'll may have to buy some more.

1502 2018-07-31 20:31:14 First, I wonder what is the source of that picture, since it is the common knowledge that food situation in late 80s was much worse than in 70s.

Second, are we now comparing calories intake? A cheap bottle of sunflower oil contains 9000 kcal, so what?
1503 2018-07-31 20:31:05 That's a really good idea. Tbh I think I learned much more from mucking about at home than I ever did at college. I recently bought some quick drying oil paints- really must get going with them. Doing arty stuff is so anxiety-relieving

1516 2018-07-31 20:29:33 ironically the Oilers have done any oil changes to that car in 11 years.
1517 2018-07-31 20:29:26 Actually care about the debt? Tell 45* to stop pissing all our money away on #TaxScam(s) for the wealthy, tariffs creating #TradeWar + #farmerbailout. Then let’s lose the farm + oil subsidies, repatriate tax-haven hidden cash, and tax churches. 

Also pay our debts to #china etc.

1520 2018-07-31 20:28:59 Please don’t use coconut oil on your face. But yes that’s the correct order. At night I recommend a serum/oil
1521 2018-07-31 20:28:46 Do you have any evening primrose oil? Take it internally.. plenty of it.. chickweed and comfrey in jojoba oil would help topically too! I'll make you some  up if you can't find any.

1531 2018-07-31 20:27:57 Someone keep an eye on the democrats back! These snake oil salesmen can’t be trusted! #TheyBackTrump #FueledTrumpsElection #CannotBeTrusted
1532 2018-07-31 20:27:54 okay so, loads of green veggies, tofu, cruciferous veggies, avocados, vegan Quorn, Linda Mac stuff, violife + metric kilos of olive oil (will give u recipes xx)
1533 2018-07-31 20:27:49 Y?  Pigtail adds flavour !  And oil !
1534 2018-07-31 20:27:45 i say curve flattens, oil keeps going down so we get a lower real rate and tech continues to outperform. financials are for the real late stage, when Fed starts easing short end.
1535 2018-07-31 20:27:35 I hope elderberry syrup cures a backache too.  Or is it coconut oil?  Or maybe Apple cider vinegar?  Halp
1536 2018-07-31 20:27:34 man, this just looks sad to me.  "The Great Awakening".   It all definitely seems cultish but they look like they genuinely believe it and have no idea they are being sold copious amounts of snake oil that will make their lives worse in the long run
1537 2018-07-31 20:27:31 More oil for others?
1538 2018-07-31 20:27:25 Oil rich chairman’s - Fulham? Watford? West Ham? Most clubs are spending Sky TV money, nothing to do with oil.
1539 2018-07-31 20:26:55 Nobody put money away. The idea that any country that doesn’t have oil can stash money is a fairytale
1540 2018-07-31 20:26:44 Obama returns back to U.S. from Africa and then Flake leaves the U.S. to go to Africa to observe elections. 
If Flake doesn't come back he'll delay the upcoming hearing on Kavanaugh for SC nominee. His name should be Fake Republican Flake!
1541 2018-07-31 20:26:44 Notes:
*If you are broken, you are teachable. 
*After you are broken, you are given and He then anoints you with His oil.
*The anointing oil gives you a good smell spiritually.
*The anointing oil protects you from the attacks of the enemy.

1542 2018-07-31 20:26:40 Really struggling ATM cos I have oil in my hair and a facemask on so I can’t lie on my back or my front, and sitting down isn’t what I want to do. #FirstWorldProblems #GirlProblems

1544 2018-07-31 20:26:35 jae’s cousin when we went to sf: oh my god your hair is like a broomstick!! you need hair oils come here. *spends 5 minutes lathering oil on jae’s hair.* see now its soft you need to invest in hair oils girl your hair is dead!!! take care of ur hair joyce god!!!
1545 2018-07-31 20:26:30 Like I said. The vast majority of dollars come back as purchases. $5T in trade. Delta of 10%. Non oil deficit is 1% of GDP,  it's meaningless.
1546 2018-07-31 20:26:23 Coconut oil!

I used to use coconut oil for my eyebrows, i would apply it with a q tip at night and wash it off in the morning and it made my eyebrows grow thick. But it did take longer, so i switched to castor oil but coconut oil is great aswell!
1547 2018-07-31 20:26:14 Brownies made with coconut oil are now my new favorite thing.
1548 2018-07-31 20:26:13 Deleted earlier tweet that had ID'd #RBOB #gasoline & #diesel/heating #oil front-month Aug contracts expiring today as Sep. But still think some of today's selling was end of month & products contract expiry driven. #OOTT #energy #futures
1549 2018-07-31 20:26:08 It is a bad thing when you no longer have expensive oil to sell, and when nobody gives you loans anymore (because you haven't returned any yet). Food shortages were caused by grain import halting, not by Gorbachev.
1550 2018-07-31 20:25:45 I pride myself in my natural abilities to get dark, no spray tan or coconut oil necessary

1552 2018-07-31 20:25:35 Batteries might be the new oil but they won"t mainstream for a few years yet.
1553 2018-07-31 20:25:34 So what are you doing about the dirtiest oil in the world? Do you even know where that is? Have you heard of Los Angeles? Clean up your own backyard before pointing at your neighbours. People in glass houses and all.
1554 2018-07-31 20:25:23 Quick somebody get Dorothy over here with that oil can!!!
1555 2018-07-31 20:24:57 You can never abandon Africa. You love her gold and diamonds. You bathe in her oil, eat her fruits and vegetables and kill and enslave her animals and people.  We'll always be greater than you because of this, and when the time comes, she will rise.
1556 2018-07-31 20:24:55 Yes, I've seen that. A lot what is defined as 'Dominionism' is simply misunderstanding normal Christian/Evangelical practices/memes/rhetoric. Like anointing leaders w/oil. Some associate w/theocracy, most Evangelicals would laugh at the idea. We oppose theocracy.
1557 2018-07-31 20:24:53 Castor oil!

Omgggg i swear castor oil is a life saver. I use it every night and wash it off in the morning and it makes my eyebrows very thick. And they grow fast.
1558 2018-07-31 20:24:48 #Graze's fries are made from fresh cut Kennebec potatoes, twice-fried Belgian-style in Non-GMO rice bran oil and seasoned with kosher salt.

1560 2018-07-31 20:24:31 I like that one & the one with baby oil. Skin be feeling amazing after. . . You use a razor the same day? I’ve always been scared of that.
1561 2018-07-31 20:24:09 Exactly! 
There’s no way you can get everything right! I find it difficult to understand how you can preach vegan products when a lot of them have palm oil, for example. 
All we can do is make our own balances!
1562 2018-07-31 20:24:07 I am super stressed 
I need those deep intense massages with oil, soft hands and a fine ass nigga with qualities

1563 2018-07-31 20:24:06 Hey!!  We already got an Early Warning Radar and a major oil terminal up here....We're a big, fat enough target as it is thank you!! 
1564 2018-07-31 20:24:06 Changed my oil, roated my tires, new brake pads, installed a new battery, and changed the air filter. Productive day if I say so myself.

1566 2018-07-31 20:23:47 I just turned my ramen noodles into the most gourmet dish ever. 

Fresh basil and green onion that I'm growing, oyster sauce, sesame oil, Chinese five spice, garlic powder, and crushed red pepper. Oh, and tumeric.
1567 2018-07-31 20:23:38 Bio oil apparently works?? Never tried it tho
1568 2018-07-31 20:23:37 1. Pure honey + Olive oil = Skin moisturizer 

2. Pure honey + Brown sugar = Face/Body exfoliator

3. Vaseline + White sugar = Lips exfoliator

4. Egg yolk + Lemon juice = Anti - reddening facial

5. Rice water + Lemon juice = Face toner

6. Raw honey only = Facial mask

1570 2018-07-31 20:23:28 Remember WWII movies when a fighter plane would get shot in the engine & the oil would spew out.The pilot would struggle with the stick & smoke would start pouring out,  the plane would slowly start to descend and then to spiral downward & take a while to crash. That's CNN & MSNB
1571 2018-07-31 20:22:53 Ameen
1572 2018-07-31 20:22:49 @barryrollan you can use the motor oil to treat your dog's skin issues right? 
1573 2018-07-31 20:22:47 IMO, if we can get the word to the public that they were purposely TAUGHT to be afraid by people who were interested in protecting interests in oil, coal and gas, there's a chance for a reasonably rapid perception shift.
Nobody likes finding out they've been lied to for money

1598 2018-07-31 20:19:47 3 day week - under Heath (a Tory) & when the first oil crisis hit.

1603 2018-07-31 20:19:28 I saw a pasta recipe last night and was like "I'll try that tomorrow". Just came back from the kitchen with my dreams shattered into pieces.... there was just a lemon, some ketchup and oil. My life sux
1604 2018-07-31 20:19:26 I read somewhere that all of these lawmakers are from states that have interests in oil and gas. I agree w/ you on the resignations, but I don't think it'll ever happen.  I'm just incredulous at the change in tone towards Russia & Putin, especially given the consensus by our IC.

1639 2018-07-31 20:13:27 @AGKilmartin Why are most mail-in rebates not valid in RI? Kind of hurts my pocket when I can't get $21 mail-in rebate on my oil change supplies for the year.  I bought a year supply so I could maximize the rebate, which I can't receive.

1668 2018-07-31 20:09:50 @realDonaldTrump Give N. Korea 1 hour to evacuate the fueling plant, fire 2 tomahawks in to it. I know you won’t and if you did China isn’t going to do anything! If they do, destroy the new islands they made and the oil well they built on another country’s territory Good Luck!!

1671 2018-07-31 20:09:20 Me: I'd like some olive oil please.

Shop: Any particular kind?

Me: I'd love one with a "non-drip" spout that isn't non-drip at all and in fact pisses olive oil all over the place at the slightest provocation.

Shop: Doesn't narrow it down I'm afraid.

1672 2018-07-31 20:09:19 My mom tried castor oil with Christopher. It didn’t work for her. 
1673 2018-07-31 20:09:17 Nah, gun oil!
1674 2018-07-31 20:09:05 It's been 3 hours. I don't care if you're busy, you're a garage with 5 bays, it takes like 20 mins to do an oil change.
1675 2018-07-31 20:08:55 I use a few drops of tea tree oil in my lotion which usually helps clear up my skin.
1676 2018-07-31 20:08:51 Went for an oil change.... $200 later I’m googling ‘how to change your own oil’
1677 2018-07-31 20:08:50 Take some cornstarch, talcum powder or even artificial sweetener and pat it into the grease spot. Let sit overnight and then brush off. The "powder" should start absorbing the oil. It may take several times to really get most of the grease out.

1680 2018-07-31 20:08:27 Logan rubbed me downnn with this heating massage oil last night  that was WONDERFUL
1681 2018-07-31 20:07:59 I thought it tasted more like the frozen vegetables in cheese sauce. I can make that in under 5 minutes & inexpensively at that. Did not try with marinara or oil & garlic. Oil & garlic is just regular schmegular sautéed zucchini.
1682 2018-07-31 20:07:47 Carluccio's chilli pesto! Literally just chilli, olive oil and sea salt.
1683 2018-07-31 20:07:39 Oh FUCK!! I can’t decide if I should spank it, eat it or oil it up and fuck it?? 
1684 2018-07-31 20:07:28 I don't get extra virgin olive oil. I prefer extremity slutty olive oil
1685 2018-07-31 20:07:27 Lovely with salt, lime juice and olive oil

1694 2018-07-31 20:05:52 Unsurprising that Western media is defaming Venezuela and blaming socialism. Never mind the repeated US attempts at overthrowing them, waging economic warfare, sanctions, and the huge fall in oil price. Cant allow anyone not acquiescing to capitalism to survive.
1695 2018-07-31 20:05:46 which oil do I use to help regrow my personality
1696 2018-07-31 20:05:38 Door Dash is SO AMAZING omg getting my oil changed and when I get home I’m gna get some food delivered straight to me #ClutchAF
1697 2018-07-31 20:05:35 Oil that produces: plastics, lubrication for wind generators, home heating, friction fighter, paved roads. Wonder what Boulder would look like with dirt roads, instead of paved roads. During the winter, you all can get out your plastic shovels.
1698 2018-07-31 20:05:28 For sure. I don’t drive like I’m on a race-course, and I change the oil every 6k. We shall see.
1699 2018-07-31 20:05:26 And when you consider they and all the oil companies shouldn't even exsst when you realise how they screwed Tesla over. We want our lost century back.
1700 2018-07-31 20:05:20 "Kerosine"=Kerosene. I guess you could just call it "coal oil" like my Mom who's from Western KY does. :)

1708 2018-07-31 20:04:34 Shouldn’t the price be going down, if oil prices every else are going down?
1709 2018-07-31 20:04:32 Wait for it
1710 2018-07-31 20:04:31 My morning was spent playing a fake patient with a migraine for med students. Then a long walk in the (comparatively cool) 90 degree temps while my oil gets changed. Don’t be jealous of my rock star lifestyle.
1711 2018-07-31 20:04:19 If Fultz isn’t shooting above 37% from 3 Drew Hanlen is a snake oil salesman I’m sorry but I have to say it
1712 2018-07-31 20:04:16 Hi! Thanks for your response! So what would be a low percentage for sensitive skin in this case? Trying to decide between that or a Vit C serum. 

And would sweet almond oil be good as moisturiser after any of the above serums?

1718 2018-07-31 20:03:14 My mom drank caster oil and coke so I would come two days early  (it worked)
1719 2018-07-31 20:03:13 Good. Does that mean we'll return all the stolen lands from American Indians since these lands have a deep religious connection to them via their dead ancestors, nature, and the Great Spirit. You don't need a damn bible to be religious. Remove the mines and oil & gas pipelines.
1720 2018-07-31 20:03:04 I can wait until @AmericanAir come back and begging us to fly with them again through 3 or 4x EQM promotion. Oil price is rising and the day AA will bleed money again is not too far away
1721 2018-07-31 20:03:00 oil fell 7.3% in July.
1722 2018-07-31 20:02:50 I need help removing the drain bolt from the oil pan of my van.  It was way stripped before I even touched it and I could use the assistance. Anyone available in heights

1728 2018-07-31 20:02:02 I am convinced that no matter what Russiagate proves or doesn't, Trump's vulnerabilities lie within the financial realm. His tax returns will prove how much of a snake oil salesman he is, and how far the illegality goes.
1729 2018-07-31 20:02:01 Find me a fat person who doesn’t consume dairy, wheat, soy, corn, sugar, pork, processed vegetable oil, and red meat. Those are the foods that make you fat. Can’t get fat overeating spinach and kale. Your stomach can’t hold the amount it would take to make you fat.
1730 2018-07-31 20:01:55 Im bout go get some oil shit
1731 2018-07-31 20:01:50 I’m getting my oil changed at this new place and they give you free drinks and snack wooow
1732 2018-07-31 20:01:38 The Koch bros are not saints. A lion's share of what is happening to public lands, national parks, and the EPA, they are behind.  Oil (and their refineries) are paramount to them.  

That being said, Trump is squarely in the Mercer camp. Hence the new tax cuts for stock traders.
1733 2018-07-31 20:01:26 Give it up!  Big oil not causing climate change.
1734 2018-07-31 20:01:13 Hate waiting on oil changes

1758 2018-07-31 19:58:31 The green energy sector can't also make it by itself. We are subsidizing an economically infeasible industry. So I am curious how long we're going to be doing this?

1805 2018-07-31 19:51:41 It's so confusing!  Mixed messages everywhere.  There is a rising oversupply of oil right now, Russia, US, Saudi, pumping record numbers, fear of under supply when Iran sanctions start.  It looks like a lot of manipulation going on right now.

1809 2018-07-31 19:51:02 The price drop was what dove us into the hole we are in now, but it was terrible economic mismanagement, rampant corruption, a historic dependence on oil and the factors that you mentioned that initially broke the foundations of Venezuela.
1810 2018-07-31 19:50:40 Great service from Murati’s Pizzeria in Wolverton tonight. One of our takeaway pizzas had too much chilli oil, and they replaced without quibble. Always great pizza from Murati’s now backed up by superb customer service. Recommended 
1811 2018-07-31 19:50:40 You can’t really grind it because the oil will muck up your grinder. It works best if you top your bowl with it like a hash chunk since it burns till it’s out or you extinguish. They hit hard, but I’d rather do a flower/dab combo.
1812 2018-07-31 19:50:35 Electric cars are going to have an incredible impact on the economy. No oil changes. No gas. Hardly any moving parts, so they will rarely breakdown and will req little maintenance. Paired with autonomy, transportation as a service could cost as little as a few cents per mile.
1813 2018-07-31 19:50:33 Ok, so I've been reading more and more about the benefits of cannabis; cbd and cbg oil from hemp and of course thc oil from cannabis... please see what you can find about that! It's natural and it relieves a lot of side effects... hugs!
1814 2018-07-31 19:50:30 It wasnt about oil, oil was a cover up of the museums and anciets sights that were looted
1815 2018-07-31 19:50:22 you dont really look at whats in your food do you... do you think soybean oil is not soy? google what food products have soybean oil and tell me again how you’ve never ingested soy. i’ll wait.

1817 2018-07-31 19:50:18 @ZacharyLevi I just want to thank you. I started taking CBD oil a month ago after you suggested it, and holy moly. It’s changed my life. I have rheumatoid arthritis and I haven’t needed advil or Prednisone for 35 days. 
I honestly don’t know how to thank you enough.
1818 2018-07-31 19:50:16 Any one ever tried cannabis oil before??

1829 2018-07-31 19:48:08 Why is it we can get oil to every corner of the planet but still can’t move water from where it rains to where it’s needed?

I’ve got two Toyota trucks (24 and 25 years old). They will go forever as long as you keep them from rusting. 

I suggest spraying your vehicle underneath with vegetable oil a couple of times a year.

1833 2018-07-31 19:47:38 The only way we are going to address this emergency is to elect people on the federal and state levels who are not beholdened to oil interests. The midterms loom bigger and bigger with every passing day.

1835 2018-07-31 19:47:27 My sister had a “direct oil & gas [job]”. She played games on her phone all day and came home with a contact high from her operator. The industry is very good at creating superfluous jobs so idiots like you and your voters will keep the gravy train rolling.

1840 2018-07-31 19:46:57 Accutane isn’t necessarily the best thing for your skin. Not only does it dry up the oil on your face but it dries up your whole body too. And you need oils in your skin to maintain its natural PH levels. Not hate just letting you know (:
1841 2018-07-31 19:46:23 If you don't spend time with #God, the oil in your lamp will go out.
1842 2018-07-31 19:46:20 Maybe they should just burn the oil? At least then it'll have value.
1843 2018-07-31 19:46:14 In recent years oil has not put anything into the treasury of note. 2 years ago the total tax take was £45m total.

1846 2018-07-31 19:45:57 Yes! This drives me nuts. Talk about taking he easy way out. This is the "cool" attitude adopted by my non-activist friends while I make a fool of myself trying to raise up #climateEmergency. One even said "the population will take care of itself". Oil companies love them!

1867 2018-07-31 19:43:57 But Syria has little oil. Russia has pumped a huge amount of resources into Syria to grow its infuence. Iran has spent an unprecedented amount of its gdp into it simply to gain influence. Trump only acts when under pressure. He’s more isolationist.

1892 2018-07-31 19:41:21 I basically gave myself exema using to much witch hazel. Its is great but all it does is strip the oil off your face in a gentler way than the hydrogen peroxide in most face wash. If your problems not caused by oily skin it’s not gonna help you and might dry you out.

1923 2018-07-31 19:37:44 Great effort but you’re analysis falls short, especially considering “many of the [reasons to oppose trans mountain] apply to fossil fuel infrastructure projects around the globe.” So you’re just against oil. We get it, but that’s no reason to impoverish Canada.
1924 2018-07-31 19:37:41 This pipeline has zero impact on oil production. It will impact the price Canada recieves for oil from its currently producing oilfields. It takes oil off of trains, which are both more dangerous and higher in GHG emission per unit transported.

1939 2018-07-31 19:36:04 Sometimes I rub myself with Cypriot olive oil, like Odysseus, keeping up a longstanding habit from my youth of doing abyanga, usually with sesame oil with herbs from India in it.  Sometimes, I used olive oil, though, as per the recommendations of the vaidyas.
1940 2018-07-31 19:36:00 Put peppermint oil on my temples. My eyes burned for 20 minutes. Put a cold rag on my face and it got worse! Now things are cooling off!

1944 2018-07-31 19:35:48 guess whose manager decided to stop for an oil change 10 minutes before her shift starts and 25 before mine ends 
1945 2018-07-31 19:35:45 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
1946 2018-07-31 19:35:40 Very creative, add one more,a pic of the ocean,then dump that plastic innit
1947 2018-07-31 19:35:30 I’m aware Kevin. But just easier to say that than I don’t eat meat, fish, eggs, dairy, leather or use anything that uses non sustainable palm oil, which a lot of vegans who come down on others seem to be okay with. But I’m good with my choices. As I’m sure you are too.
1948 2018-07-31 19:35:26 One of my ex Landlady's had one of these. It survived without oil for ages. I'm not sure if it's still alive. Probably is.
1949 2018-07-31 19:35:08 Nigerians deserve better than they have had this past 58 years. Can you give us a new dream and a new hope?? What common vision can we all have as Nigerians that will be bigger than our religion & tribe? It has gone beyond just being the president and selling crude oil products!!
1950 2018-07-31 19:35:05 @pgarrett my boss, Nina Selzer, is a HUGE fan of yours, her birthday is this friday and it would mean THE WORLD if you sent her a note or voice message. She's a hugely dedicated fan who has traveled the world to see Midnight Oil, as well as a member of the fan club.
1951 2018-07-31 19:34:53 I use the Shea moisture coconut oil moisturizer and it works so well (however, actual coconut oil on your skin clogs your pores this moisturizer works so well!)
1952 2018-07-31 19:34:49 Gold lowers closer to 1212 with nervous reactions the opposite along t way. Should t metall fall through, & especially kick under 1200, oil will give up it’s 70 climb. And it’s suddenly nervous being pulled down a little already.
1953 2018-07-31 19:34:45 My favorite is sliced and grilled, seasoned with olive oil and salt, pepper, garlic, and rosemary. Although you just can't beat homemade bread.
1954 2018-07-31 19:34:43 Has dollar one been paid yet? Any chance of you naysayers waiting until it actually happens before harping? Who paid for ethanol and alternative energy subsidies? Who pays for oil/gas subsidies and tax breaks?
1955 2018-07-31 19:34:39 Let's not act like KSA isn't one large desert. The moment the demand for oil ends, you'll be back to riding camels...
1956 2018-07-31 19:34:37 Great at reinforcing public perception lawyers are lower than whale excrement in general.
But when you need one, the best pick is the  one most totally void of ethics and moral values.
1957 2018-07-31 19:34:32 My mominlaw was here and told me about someone she knows who recently took cannabis oil in an attempt to aid his insomnia.

1969 2018-07-31 19:31:25 I like when the internet gives you an easy solution. I needed to top my car's oil up, but don't have a funnel and didn't want oil to go everywhere. A quick Google gave me the idea of cutting a drinks bottle top off to make a homemade one. #sorted #lifehacks

1982 2018-07-31 19:29:51 Venezuela’s situation was caused a lot by IMF’s and the “western” stages policies forcing the country to adopt austerity measures and almost solely produce periphery commodities. Then the global oil price drop by OPEC caused other problems because its venezuela’s chief export.

1989 2018-07-31 19:28:43 I understand your point. I think the more important part is that Alberta appears to becoming less dependent on oil and gas and that is good for the economic stability of the province. #ableg

1998 2018-07-31 19:27:47 Rubbing a small amount of mineral oil into a wooden kitchen item periodically will impede absorption of food liquids, and thereby food odors, and ease cleaning. It is used for treating and preserving wooden butcher block counter tops.

2003 2018-07-31 19:27:18 No, very little oil in Syria. Iran might, but they aren’t going to lie down are they. They may well bomb Israel. Threatened to often enough.
2004 2018-07-31 19:27:07 Because of its properties that prevent water absorption, combined with its lack of flavor and odor, food grade mineral oil is a popular preservative for wooden cutting boards, salad bowls and utensils.
2005 2018-07-31 19:27:02 Cmon like an oil spill takes a few bardge or maybe tankers to clear from its area of spill ...so gradually over the years will re Zimbos wake from the night mare..not at the flick of a lighter mate ...
2006 2018-07-31 19:26:41 For the leaks try Barr's Stop leak where you can, crank case, trans etc.  Old seals dry out and shrink, then leak. Barr's causes the seals to swell up, same stuff is found in high mileage motor oil, but lower content. Beats changing out seals and works great.
2007 2018-07-31 19:26:39 Food grade mineral oil has an E number of E905a, although it has not been approved in food products in the European Union, and incidental amounts in foods are carefully regulated.
2008 2018-07-31 19:26:39 Boomers talk about the 2010s being a lawless decade of anomie and detachment like okay Martha didn't you live through the decade where white people with afros were having picnics on abandoned motorways because there wasn't any oil

2012 2018-07-31 19:26:04 You are sounding like you don't know that it is the oil price effect.  They should have listed the price for oil from that 2010 to 2017
2013 2018-07-31 19:25:56 Jamaican black castor oil is really the shit

2016 2018-07-31 19:25:17 And without an oil and gas boom they're not that attractive to the EU. They'll have to rely on tourism and fishing. Hang on strike the fishing the EU decimated that.
2017 2018-07-31 19:25:00 I support @realDonaldTrump but he has #oil all screwed up and turned backwards. #LessIsMore for U.S. and ONLY way we can stay independent is with WTI at $65+. 

Trump also wants a wall and he's NOT getting that either.

2018 2018-07-31 19:24:52 Qaddafi got taken out because he was planning on trading oil for gold backed dinar. This was a threat to the petrodollar recycling system. A paid mercenary group took him out. If Libya had been connected to the Bank of International Settlements under Qaddafi he would be alive
2019 2018-07-31 19:24:52 my mom tried to tell me fries won’t make me gain weight if I squeeze the oil out with a napkin

2021 2018-07-31 19:24:25 The term "Paraffinum Liquidum" is often seen on the ingredient lists of baby oil and cosmetics. British aromatherapists commonly use the term "white mineral oil".

2024 2018-07-31 19:24:07 "Mineral oil", sold widely and cheaply in the USA, is not sold as such in Britain. Instead British pharmacologists use the terms "Paraffinum perliquidum" for light mineral oil and "Paraffinum liquidum" or "Paraffinum subliquidum" for somewhat thicker (more viscous) varieties.
2025 2018-07-31 19:23:52 Oilman finds oil, loses self
2026 2018-07-31 19:23:38 Because our "leaders" hate oil.
2027 2018-07-31 19:23:33 Baby oil is a perfumed mineral oil. Most often, mineral oil is a liquid by-product of refining crude oil to make gasoline, other petroleum products. This type of mineral oil is a transparent, colorless oil, composed mainly of alkanes and cycloalkanes, related to petroleum jelly.
2028 2018-07-31 19:23:31 Justin got 40 his closest friends (his mommy/ wifes mom +dad/ pres of LPC/ finance guy for lpc...) invited at the Whitehouse for an amazing event with Obama.  Why traded making an agreement with Obama for a fancy meal.  Obama totally outsmarted JT cutting our oil from competition
2029 2018-07-31 19:23:21 There is that one video when she got Matt Damon friend to dress like a b boy and rub oil on her ass.
2030 2018-07-31 19:22:54 The name mineral oil by itself is imprecise, having been used for many specific oils over the past few centuries. Other names, similarly imprecise, include white oil, paraffin oil, liquid paraffin, a highly refined medical grade, paraffinum liquidum (Latin), and liquid petroleum.
2031 2018-07-31 19:22:54 Used this oil I bought last year to heal my tense muscles after a night bath and it is working like magic! Will be ready for work in the morning

We've got 30-something episodes of the Midnight Oil podcast (Comfortable Place on the Couch) which are mainly aimed at fans of the band, but maybe you'll like it too.

2034 2018-07-31 19:22:43 This was an interesting listen on multiple levels. I learned of a conflict I knew nothing about. 

Also interesting to hear about the Silk Road and the healing oil. I’m with Thad I’d jump all the way in.
2035 2018-07-31 19:22:37 Mineral oil is any of various colorless, odorless, light mixtures of higher alkanes from a mineral source, particularly a distillate of petroleum.

2037 2018-07-31 19:22:28 Did he find oil?
2038 2018-07-31 19:22:22 yeah it was really dry and it had a weird smell that for some reason was familiar idk if thats just me tho. that should work i dont see why not. when i got it it was just the cvs brand tea tree oil. its not gonna work asap cause everyones skins reacts differently itll take a bit
2039 2018-07-31 19:22:09 right now though, i don't have a scale to measure so i just split one gram of isolate powder in half and let dissolve into two 1oz bottles of coconut oil. that's $25 worth of the isolate into 2 bottles...and i should be getting 450-500ml/bottle now, which is more than before.
2040 2018-07-31 19:22:08 You know something big is coming when oil clubs troll crypto. And “club” is this a high school project. DYOH (homework) and check back with us.

2059 2018-07-31 19:20:26 @CBCNB gas cost per litre is high only because of taxes upon taxes (fed&prov) it is not oil companies raising prices.
2060 2018-07-31 19:20:22 Yes but as you know... it escalates. It's immaterial who throws the first stone...  Iran and Syria will get sorted eventually because if it's oil and that will be decided no doubt by the US. Trump has been constantly flexing his muscles try to measure up against Putin.
2061 2018-07-31 19:20:21 I remember in the 1990's the oil industry getting out of the Permian basin because it was drying up....

2084 2018-07-31 19:17:47 Have y’all ever tried CBD oil?
2085 2018-07-31 19:17:42 I don’t trust doctors. If I feel unwell, I just go for dry brushing, and put some hibiscus essential oil in my diffuser.
2086 2018-07-31 19:17:09 Sophisticated and Facebook, blend as well as, oil and water.
2087 2018-07-31 19:16:54 A palm oil product which implicates Coffee-mate in destroying the habitat of the Orangutans in Indonesia....and which has no respect for life on Earth as a Nestle Company doing the same to privatize our water and pollute the seas with plastic.
2088 2018-07-31 19:16:54 Seriously, I'm a virgin! Where do you think they get virgin olive oil?
2089 2018-07-31 19:16:46 I heard a case of coconut oil
2090 2018-07-31 19:16:46 nah he probably put vegetable oil on the clouds
2091 2018-07-31 19:16:09 Everybody has freedom o, only if the bus enters gallop and you use your palm oil hand to stain my white shirt, only then....
2092 2018-07-31 19:16:01 man loves oil, hates people
2093 2018-07-31 19:15:48 Ohh
No no! I meant Multi Level Marketing!
Like those housewives who message their facebook friends trying to seel them snake oil!
2094 2018-07-31 19:15:29 Lol umm I’m Italian and put grease (Argon oil) in my hair from time to time... put the two together, you get greasy Italian. That’s offensive how? Lol
2095 2018-07-31 19:15:23 How does this math work ?? The US domestically produced 10.45m BPD of oil and total usage is about 19.7m BPD.
2096 2018-07-31 19:15:18 Does your vehicle need routine maintenance? Not a problem! Our service centre can take care of oil change, lube and filter maintenance, new tires, brake repair and more.
2097 2018-07-31 19:15:14 just believe it. water and oil cannot be mixed
2098 2018-07-31 19:15:03 Coconut oil makes great pineapple upside down cake.
2099 2018-07-31 19:14:48 ~ Still helping Jake through his ordeal. No real answers yet. Treating it as acid reflux for now, putting him back on a strict diet. Needs to take Cultrelle, fish oil, vit D and Omeprazole. Sh doesn’t think there’s a bowel obstruction but only time will tell.if he continues this
2100 2018-07-31 19:14:46 Listen up: @SecretaryZinke has strong ties to Bakken oil. It was a shale formation set up by a Russian by the name of Mr. Vashkevich.
2101 2018-07-31 19:14:37 Getting my oil changed while my face is numb from the dentist 
2102 2018-07-31 19:14:30 "If PDP comes to look for votes from you in 2019, please asked why they couldn't complete Lagos - Ibadan expressway - a road that is less than 150 kilometers, after 16years in power, and so much earnings from crude oil sales.
2103 2018-07-31 19:14:20 Ronnie Bateman of the 55th Ave KFC has fully recovered from his hot oil burn and will be sent to the AAA affiliate Jefferson Street Pizza Hut for a rehab assignment.
2104 2018-07-31 19:14:09 BS. Some of it is exaggeration, but none of it is lies. YES we overpay horribly to the corrupt asswipes at the UN. YES Germany buys oil from Russia, and they would be smarter to buy it from us. Its funny to see Trump talk up America to the world, and you work against him, and us
2105 2018-07-31 19:14:06 So if you don't like that cartoony Venom running up the tower, that's the Sony exec's overriding my consultation. In the original cut, Venom moved, flowed like oil. Then the bruh came in after everything wrapped and had to push his weight around, added tons of new "action" shots.
2106 2018-07-31 19:14:02 Bacteria survived longest on plastic followed by stainless steel. Wood cutting boards should be regularly seasoned with a good quality cutting board oil. Keep your knives sharp.  Dull knives mean that you have to press harder to cut, which will mark up your board.
2107 2018-07-31 19:13:58 Use vitamin E oil! I'm at a 0 or 00 and the oil helps a lot and it's cheap at your local drugstore
2108 2018-07-31 19:13:57 made my own cbd oil out of isolate powder today bc i really can't be paying $40 for a 1oz bottle
2109 2018-07-31 19:13:49 お疲れ様です…
2110 2018-07-31 19:13:13 Yours is a straw man's argument. You can not attribute the job losses to the NDP as it was ongoing when they took office. For over 40 years, conservatives dominated Albera politics and they neglected to diversify the economy living us doomed oil price fluctuations.
2111 2018-07-31 19:12:57 Let me bless myself with this coconut oil
2112 2018-07-31 19:12:46 May God bless your source, is one thing for one  to have and its another thing for one to be a giver. May your jar of oil never run dry Egbon!
2113 2018-07-31 19:12:40 “Shell Oil” wins Sugar’s heart.
2114 2018-07-31 19:12:32 RT THE WHOLE OIL CRISES, COOLING, WARMING .. wind turbine experiments .. wind turbine negative findings discovered/buried 1988ish, goring, greenwashing is batcrapcrazy ..

2115 2018-07-31 19:12:26 Great deligation skills! #indiehour
2116 2018-07-31 19:12:26 Does that include LNG and other refined products in barrels of oil equivalent? If these are included, the figure will be really significant!!
2117 2018-07-31 19:11:53 Ah cooking oil kanti 
2118 2018-07-31 19:11:40 We don't care that they are in a tiff with Trump (who isn't), because they are STILL those greedy oil tycoon bastards who are detestable in every way ... 

The enemy of my enemy is rarely my friend ...
2119 2018-07-31 19:11:38 FRIENDS whether we want it or not, the Yemen situation is developing to BIG international crisis, only a week ago oil shipments through Red Sea Bab al Mandab were stopped after Yemeni Houthis attacks there on tankers. OIL is almost 40% of global energy use nowadays. BIG CONCERN
2120 2018-07-31 19:11:22 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2121 2018-07-31 19:11:15 We're number one in oil, how much more do they need. And gas is still high.
2122 2018-07-31 19:11:14 Not really impressed with the new @PalmersUK Coconut Oil, Anti-Oxidant, Firming Lotion. It’s supposed to be ‘24 hours moisture’.
2123 2018-07-31 19:11:09 Tried rinsing my mouth with coconut oil....never again
2124 2018-07-31 19:11:01 Hey @VinnieTortorich breakfast today, 2 cups coffee, 2 strips no sugar bacon, 2 eggs over 3 cups cooked down spinach in olive oil and butter. Delish. Estimated cost: $2.60. Took 5 minutes to make. All bought at local mass market grocery store. How hard is that?
2125 2018-07-31 19:10:50 Ugh dude I'm producing so much oil I feel so gross 
2126 2018-07-31 19:10:50 I love being a girl working in the oil & gas industry.
2127 2018-07-31 19:10:43 OOOH SHE USED LIKE. tea tree oil shampoo that smelled super minty that might be it,, for a second i thought he wanted it bc of the way the dye smells omg
2128 2018-07-31 19:10:26 And you still won't buy coconut oil to celebrate abi?
2129 2018-07-31 19:10:23 Castor oil

2131 2018-07-31 19:10:16 The best CBD Oil I have ever tried!! I am finally sleeping all night!
It’s coming soon!

Post interested and I'll send you info
2132 2018-07-31 19:10:15 Mr. Ardalan kept on saying we "lost our economic independence". We didn't have any economy or technology to extract the oil that was discovered not by ourselves but the Brits. They keep repeating the same communist propaganda.
2133 2018-07-31 19:10:13 Tuesday #Tax Tidbit: Two factors that contributed to @txcomptroller’s recent increased state #revenue estimate: Sales tax collections through June are up by nearly 12% compared to last year, while #oil & natural #gas tax collections have risen by more than 50%. #txlege #budget
2134 2018-07-31 19:10:05 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
2135 2018-07-31 19:10:02 U can't imagine another party ruled this country for good 16years while we sell a barrel of crude oil for $150 and we produced more that 2million barrels per day, what did they do with those money, to the extent that there was nothing left in 2015 for buhari only debt.
2136 2018-07-31 19:10:00 NEW ITEM - The Divine Sprout, made with all organic ingredients from a local business. Mix with water and oil and it’s gonna be delicious!
2137 2018-07-31 19:09:25 Next time you make brownies, try mixing in some laxative and cannabis oil. Just for shits and giggles.
2138 2018-07-31 19:08:57 Day drinking is pretty nice. Day off to plan for a really big show, after party of said show. Oil change, probably make some awesome food. Next day off will be for the outdoors and fishing. Drinking will most likely happen then too. What can I say? Enjoy your life!
2139 2018-07-31 19:08:38 Hey now, my lotion and baby oil regimen is very reasonable!
2140 2018-07-31 19:08:37 Oh no. Blepharitis is horrid. I’ve got loads of coconut oil in so will try. But worried about the t tree as im not sure if im a bit allergic.
2141 2018-07-31 19:08:33 Immigrant Family Sells Olive Oil
2142 2018-07-31 19:08:26 Complete scandal... I've been using fish oil for years.
Disgraceful headline 
Here, here,here.
2143 2018-07-31 19:08:25 おつかれさまです！
2144 2018-07-31 19:08:24 Sorry guys, turns out that the Muhammad who followed me yesterday does not even have 1 gallon of oil. He is a Bangladesh fellow, employed in a Spaza selling fong kong iPhone accessories and fake Albany bread.
2145 2018-07-31 19:08:11 So far we only have trouble with small hive beetles. We recently put down an oil trap to eradicate them. #plantchat
2146 2018-07-31 19:07:58 I could work for an oil company. I could work for a non-recyclable plastic packaging company. You know why I'd have to work for them? *capitalism*

Without capitalism I'd be free to work on something that would actually better mankind.
2147 2018-07-31 19:07:54 The oil of gladness.
2148 2018-07-31 19:07:50 For me profit sale and end of the month triangle and Ma20 vs Ma9 correction ended for crude oil. It is highly likely buy point. SL is hourly mark under 68.38 if it is timely second mark maybe. Do not give number of it. BUY crude oil. #usoıl #oil #crudeoil #oott
2149 2018-07-31 19:07:39 MCT oil supplement in the morning! It's helped a lot with preventing that afternoon sluggishness that can hit you
2150 2018-07-31 19:07:23 Get some mozzarella, olive oil, & some crunchy Italian bread. Done!!!
2151 2018-07-31 19:06:45 When there is no oil in the reservoir
2152 2018-07-31 19:06:39 You need to do homework on Syria.. Who stopped the building of a major oil/gas pipeline going through Syria to supply Europe and topple Putin ??? Who transitioned Al-Q into ISIS and stopped US missions to destroy them ??? Which senator is photo'd socialising with ISIS leadership.
2153 2018-07-31 19:06:33 watched the trailer for the new Venmo movie and its all just tom hardy covered in oil and talking with a weird accent??? not a single scene of him transferring money to his friends to pay them back for fast food!
2154 2018-07-31 19:06:15 Shit. And I am clearly better then that drummer from Midnight Oil who is average
2155 2018-07-31 19:06:10 @davidaha_a come and see o 
2156 2018-07-31 19:06:07 I’m not into blame game.... institutions doesn’t limit to the players in the oil sector... no wahala sha.. until we are ready.. na here we go dey!
2157 2018-07-31 19:06:07 #CrudeOil prices settled lower as easing expectations for steep losses of #Iranian #Crude offset data expected to show #USA #Oil #stockpiles fell for the second-straight week

2158 2018-07-31 19:06:06 Grrrrrrr. Sounds like Tanzania, couldn’t leave tractors in fields as all the oil, diesel etc would be gone!
2159 2018-07-31 19:06:02 dextrose is a sugar compound, tbhq prevents the potatoes from oxygenating while frozen, hydrolyzed wheat and milk make up the batter, and dimethylpolysiloxane (the only truly questionable ingredient imo) prevents oil from foaming around the fries
2160 2018-07-31 19:06:00 Oil prices aren't' back up to $100 per barrel again either....false equivalency BS.
2161 2018-07-31 19:05:59 Fried chicken — can’t get the oil hot enough at home.
2162 2018-07-31 19:05:56 Castor oil
2163 2018-07-31 19:05:55 $100 i am a fuken olive oil
2164 2018-07-31 19:05:53 Seeing the truth is as if looking into the abyss of nothing. like a black oil it drowns in desolation until its understood that truth is reality or of mind. If alive 1 choose life as if a poem of love and life enables the power of mind to create anything it wants
2165 2018-07-31 19:05:41 Ok how much packaging do they produce how much plastic do they use how much oil do they use to produce there products you talk about waste I'm talking about all the waste not just food
2166 2018-07-31 19:05:34 watched all the seasons..season 4 should be out soon
2167 2018-07-31 19:05:32 Boyfriend's getting new tires & an oil change for our little trip on Thursday
2168 2018-07-31 19:05:27 Dude coconut oil be a problem solver for everything lol
2169 2018-07-31 19:05:26 I be feeling like a got a brand new car when I get a oil change lol
2170 2018-07-31 19:05:26 Armageddon remake but the oil drillers they get are Daniel Plainview and his team.
2171 2018-07-31 19:05:18 Oil and gas refining is most surprising one to me.
2172 2018-07-31 19:05:13 Pro tip. Oil and gas are boom and bust industries. They are very unstable...
2173 2018-07-31 19:05:02 You don't get rid of the fifth Oil producer by only urging the others to produce more, there are things you can't change with a simple phone call Donald.
2174 2018-07-31 19:04:43 Unless Georgie's group is set up in an oil refinery, I sincerely doubt it...
2175 2018-07-31 19:04:41 MOST essential oils are toxic to both dogs and cats. Stop being selfish and just wash your fucking house instead of masking the smell with an oil that could potentially put your animal in resp. distress or heart failure!
2176 2018-07-31 19:04:37 Re-listening to this, I realize that there are endless ways to do this song. I know that's what jazz IS, but this is so unique and makes me wish I learned guitar. You're obviously having FUN. I find the same to be true with oil painting - a great painting makes me want to paint.
2177 2018-07-31 19:04:26 พิดิVโช๊คค !!!  โอ๊ยย  เป็นพิยู๊กกชินเหมือนเดิมเถอะค่า นุชขอว์ 
2178 2018-07-31 19:04:23 Mark tried to bribe me with Oil well, but with the way things are I am not comfortable with that Party.
2179 2018-07-31 19:04:21 i rubed castor oil in my stomach as i heart it 'relieves constipation' and i hope it will make me shit tmrw morning
2180 2018-07-31 19:04:19 When I was ecperiencing frequent sleep paralysis, my Mom got our pastor back home to bless some oil to keep in my home.
2181 2018-07-31 19:04:19 Seen the oil industry is investing in alternative energy pharma could invest in preventive health monitoring.
2182 2018-07-31 19:04:11 When you use your PnL to persuade people that your teachings are valuable, you must proof that your PnL is true. Otherwise, you are just an snake oil salesman,And telling people to be skeptical about other educators, forces you to agree to have cynism being applied to you as well
2183 2018-07-31 19:03:42 Working in the Oil Center is a trap because I’m always either eating Roly Poly or Cafe Lola.
2184 2018-07-31 19:03:41 Oil price in same years?
2185 2018-07-31 19:03:35 Who is d idiot that blocked me
2186 2018-07-31 19:03:27 There is no resource on this planet that will ever be able to replace oil in terms of all the stuff you can crate out of it. Had been not for oil you wouldn't have half of the stuff around you that you have.
2187 2018-07-31 19:03:22 What he said is true tho, sanctions are enforced on 7th August and Sanctions relating to oil are enforced in October, the currency currently is 120,000 rials = $1 once the sanctions start to squeeze the whole country may fall
2188 2018-07-31 19:03:09 Lol then you're not a politician if you don't hv influence.
2189 2018-07-31 19:03:07 But hasn’t he always stated he doesn’t have vast amounts of cash like some other clubs oil rich chairmans? Deluded toon fans expecting stuff again because of 55,000 fans every other week
2190 2018-07-31 19:03:03 인쟈 자야지
2191 2018-07-31 19:03:02 I just want a big muscly black man to come into my life so I can give him oil massages every night before bed, take care of him and love the fuck out of him 
2192 2018-07-31 19:02:57 Ladies and gents.....kwani you don't moisturize and oil your backs??? Coz elbows and knees aren't the only ashy things in this our Nairobi..... 
I saw the ashiest back on my way to work today.....heh.....
2193 2018-07-31 19:02:55 I brought a coupon for the oil change but I guess it only works for conventional oil but my stupid space car has to take synthetic oil 
2194 2018-07-31 19:02:55 Try flaxseed oil and b complex vitamins.  Are you taking a daily multivitamin?  Plenty of rest and water.   Much better for you.  You need to reinforce your body for stress.  Stress is very taxing on the body.  Please take care. 
2195 2018-07-31 19:02:48 Not true. He worked his ass off to save the automotive industry for example. He also opened more land to natural gas exploration than any other president in history. USA became independent of foreign oil and are now on track to be the largest producer of gas products in the world
2196 2018-07-31 19:02:40 high fuel prices and considering selling oil from the nation's emergency supply. (A week later, details of a plan to do just that leaked.)"

2197 2018-07-31 19:02:39 Alcoholic finds Oil, drinks milkshake
2198 2018-07-31 19:02:33 Politeness is the oil which reduces the friction against each other.
2199 2018-07-31 19:02:30 "what country do we get most of our oil from?"
"uh....... texas?"
2200 2018-07-31 19:02:30 Legal entities already pay to use public lands today, eg, oil drilling, cattle ranching, concerts. That’s a socialist model
2201 2018-07-31 19:02:28 Uh, what happens when a boat sinks and the fuel and oil leak out of the hull? 

Pretty sure when they are old you recycle them like other batteries so they can reclaim the materials for new equipment. 

What happens when you burn gas in an engine? Sounds good but is it ??
2202 2018-07-31 19:02:23 Since Nigeria is collecting #Abachaloots from swiss,then one can evidently say those who works with abacha looted. Buhari was one of them. He was in charge of the oil funds. I don't think he would love to come back to power if oil is no longer there. He loves oil wealth!
2203 2018-07-31 19:02:21 People slapping an oil filter on a photo getting more support than those who are actually trying to learn and perfect their craft, im tilted rn
2204 2018-07-31 19:02:19 I have an appointment for an oil change rn so it better not take so long 
2205 2018-07-31 19:02:12 Blame OPECs 45 years of oil profits.
2206 2018-07-31 19:01:41 U.S. exporters to outpace imports by 2020, certain conditions need to be met, including high oil prices, lots of resources and rapid technological improvements. Otherwise, EIA projects net U.S. energy exports by 2022 Canada

2209 2018-07-31 19:01:36 Everyone should shave their legs using baby oil, BEST THING EVER
2210 2018-07-31 19:01:32 Got to give the Libs credit, they're damn lucky. Harper faced the worst economic downturn in 80 years as well as collapsing oil prices. Libs now are on the heels of a hot American economy and Rising oil prices. Were it not for those 2 things Trudeau would have us in a recession.
2211 2018-07-31 19:01:28 I love how you have no self-awareness for the fact that his pro-American profile pic was meant to be humorous.  I do wonder what your own profile pic says about how crazy you are.  How many cats do you own?
2212 2018-07-31 19:01:28 Politics=Interest if you know,you know

2215 2018-07-31 19:01:11 Love your supportive products. Especially your labour oil... such a wonderful idea if u have a partner to get them to massage lower back on the day.  well done ladies xx
2216 2018-07-31 19:01:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, or these voices to be heard.
2217 2018-07-31 19:01:06 You say the high foreign reserve is due to the price of crude oil, I agree but during Jonathan's era, we sold hire but we didn't have as much as this foreign reserve. Our reserve will be placed in top 5 in Africa. You ask what effect it has on the masses, PTA/BTA.....
2218 2018-07-31 19:01:05 Does anyone know anything about CBD oil??? As a pain reliever?  Anyone try it?
2219 2018-07-31 19:01:01 I sometimes fantasize about being prescribed an oil drum of Valium but happily it remains just an occasional fantasy!
2220 2018-07-31 19:00:38 Ugh right? This front office is ass. But, I’m hoping we have some changes (managerial side of things) and can get some new oil in for these Angels of ours.

2227 2018-07-31 19:00:03 I can't drink tea, I have lavender oil I put on my pillow which normally puts me to sleep but it didn't tonight
2228 2018-07-31 19:00:03 @Petromincorp Is that true you have directed all petromin express shops to NOT change oil filter for Geely cars???

2232 2018-07-31 18:59:51 Yes, today's GDP numbers (based on $ value) are positive, largely b/c of oil & gas activity - incl. oil price increase. But some sobering stats. 25k direct oil & gas jobs lost during recession have not returned to Alberta. 54k fewer private-sector jobs since the NDP formed govt.
2233 2018-07-31 18:59:36 It does!! And I don’t mind if it gets in my mouth  and it’s so cheap compared to store bought face wash brands!!! If you want an actual brand to check out, Marie Veronique. I use their treatment oil when I have dry skin bursts
2234 2018-07-31 18:59:35 Seriously someone needs to do some real work on oil revenues and Nigeria....it sad looks all opaque sector and @NNPCgroup needs to educate and engage more!

papayag ba ng joint exploration kung hindi nila alam ang malaking reserba  ng oil & gas? Natambakan na mga buhangin  na tinatawag reclaimed/artificial island.
2239 2018-07-31 18:58:57 Another thought. Just remembered that I when I had a bad attack of bletharitis I found a tip for  coconut oil. Melt it then add a few drops of teetree oil and lavender oil. It cleared it up.
2240 2018-07-31 18:58:34 None of these people are artists. They’re all formulaic snake oil formulaic fixed mindset sales people.

2244 2018-07-31 18:58:05 @PeterAttiaMD is an astaxanthin supplement worth it, for stressed joints due to running, if I am already taking Krill oil with (1mg) & 6oz of Salmon 2x a week?
2245 2018-07-31 18:58:03 Overall lower oil is better for the global economy but get the implications for the US producers. Maybe Infrastructure Investment would help??

2252 2018-07-31 18:57:28 City can win the quadruple, will never be as big as United and you can tweet what you want but deep down you know it to be true. Few years of oil money makes you relevant, not big.
2253 2018-07-31 18:57:15 I thought it was the ultimate bless having a portable console to help me relax in my oil field job out in the desert. Now it's more of a bless cause I get to play Devolver games! Thanks NinVolver!

2259 2018-07-31 18:55:54 Hang in there, friend. Try organic CBD oil. It takes a few weeks of consistent use  to feel a difference but it’s non-psychotropic. 8 drops under tongue 2x a day. It has done wonders for us.
2260 2018-07-31 18:55:41 omg same tho I'll never get one of these oil glitter cases
2261 2018-07-31 18:55:30 how about
private talks with Russia
asking Russia to fix election
making allies mad
golfing more days than days spent working
not smart
won't listen to experts
wants oil drilling in natl parks

I used simplest words I could and I still want to scream.
2262 2018-07-31 18:55:29 I wonder if that has to do with US economic sanctions—which have been condemned by the UN as targeting the poor—or the fall in oil prices, or the fact that capitalists still control most of the economy and are openly trying to cause shortages to destabilize the government?
2263 2018-07-31 18:55:28 & if you wash it with something too harsh for your skin (or too often) it can strip your skin from it’s natural oils, throwing your water/oil balance off, which can cause your skin to produce too much oil
2264 2018-07-31 18:55:12 yes    lower  oil   gas   America  needs  better   prices   here
2265 2018-07-31 18:54:56 Will ditch oil for crypto coz 2000 TPS looks bleak for 2020.
2266 2018-07-31 18:54:52 It’s not mortar. It’s fine sand and boiled linseed oil. It’s mimicking sand a red lead. Mortars were usually coloured with red pigment. Freshly crushed brick dust creates hydraulic effect, but it’s usually pink in colour due to the low % in the mortar
2267 2018-07-31 18:54:50 EIA: US Total Oil Demand In May Up 1.6% Or 318K Bpd Versus Last Year At 20.357M Bpd (Vs 2.0% Rise In April) #OOTT
2268 2018-07-31 18:54:50 We need a commoner Doug DeMuro. Someone who reviews a used 2012 Camry and gives it a Doug score based on average  cost of oil change, how many boosters seats can fit, how many groceries fit in trunk, cup holder vs Venti Starbucks, insurance cost and MPG in real world driving.
2269 2018-07-31 18:54:43 At this point, the earth itself is an environmental disaster, like an oil pipeline eating its own tail.
2270 2018-07-31 18:54:37 Oil was discovered under the North Sea off the shores of Scotland and a country inside the M25 got exceedingly rich.
2271 2018-07-31 18:54:34 Kalms tablets which are natural, or St. John’s wort, otherwise nothing like lavender oil burning or on pulse points. Neals Yard do good rescue remedies too like tongue drops.

2274 2018-07-31 18:54:18 they're so great! I really enjoy making a salad with sliced cherry tomatoes, olive oil and ricotta. Sprinkle some salt and it's great.
2275 2018-07-31 18:54:17 No oil can in this lot then
2276 2018-07-31 18:53:56 Go in for JUST an oil change

Need new shocks,  transmission leak,  crack in the radiator,  poor financial health,  glaucoma is picking up,  and love life is non existent. #Chevy #lifegoals
2277 2018-07-31 18:53:49 I, for one, would not want to binge watch that 300-part video series on YouTube.
2278 2018-07-31 18:53:36 Signs Trump works for Russia: 1. He forced NATO nations to pay $44B more in '17 than they did in '16, 2. He signed record sanctions against Russian companies &diplomats, 3. He told Germany Chancellor Merkel to stop paying $400B/yr to Russia for gas & oil but instead buy from USA.
2279 2018-07-31 18:53:18 normally i’d bitch abt work but today’s been good tbh? my only issue is the rancid oil taste in my fucking mouth and even that’s ok rn since i’m eating
2280 2018-07-31 18:53:13 Absolutely not :) and the oil is probably easy to clean up compared to the glitter ;)
2281 2018-07-31 18:53:13 Peppermint oil is supposed to help kickstart labor!
2282 2018-07-31 18:53:03 You all dont care about the USA having Energy Dominance - the rest of the WORLD is sprinting ahead of us IN GREEN ENERGY 
this is the way the world us going
GETTING AWAY from OIL & COAL
let the USA get back to work on GREEN ENERGY & HELP Coal Companies Diversify into Green Energy
2283 2018-07-31 18:52:52 apni bhabi se pooch le. but I have heart and liver issues so I get only diet food and my whole pocket money goes on eating bahar or home delivery when nobody is at home. Taras jata hoon. All I get is salmon fish and green vegetable cooked in olive oil without masala 
2284 2018-07-31 18:52:50 After putting too much coconut oil in my #BulletproofCoffee on Sunday, today I dialed it back and it made a tremendous difference.
2285 2018-07-31 18:52:33 169 KW/h of electricity produces the same BTU as 1 barrel of oil
2286 2018-07-31 18:52:17 kind of parallel to Roger Rabbit public transportation/big oil theme
2287 2018-07-31 18:52:09 After waiting for 13min for a simple paneer wrap , what I get is a half cooked oil dropping wrap . @mcdonaldsindia this is pathetic . Simply not acceptable . Waste of money and time . I want my money back .
2288 2018-07-31 18:51:54 Oil!
2289 2018-07-31 18:51:40 So we consume a lot of oil... at least my plugs are easy to change lol

2296 2018-07-31 18:50:29 The 0 point food is nice tho. You can cook salmon and veggies for dinner and only use 1 or 2 points for oil or butter. And I got an air fryer recently and have been using that a ton.
2297 2018-07-31 18:50:27 I finished cooking something and I moved a spatula over the stove and some oil dripped and it went POOF and it was a fire so I freaked out and blew it out before it got big (so maybe not the entire kitchen but still FIRE)

2299 2018-07-31 18:50:25 Yeah...I skipped college for a stint in the military,  obtained a great skill, and now make 6 figures working offshore oil exploration.   Most the people I work with didnt go to college or the military and are doing damn well for themselves.
2300 2018-07-31 18:50:16 It rejuvinates the skin,he probably didn't mix it with oil , that's why it looks like that.

2306 2018-07-31 18:49:31 More than half the products I used for make up are oil free and my face still ends up looking like a frikin' mirror.
2307 2018-07-31 18:49:25 Seeing what Saudi arabia and qatar did with their Oil, it makes me wonder if it's coconut Oil Nigeria sells

2310 2018-07-31 18:49:17 I know a lot of people who find success with CBD oil.  Hopefully you do too!  Plus I got a code for 10% off juice at @VapeWild if you're interested
2311 2018-07-31 18:49:16 Where did you get the oil? I have to try it

2313 2018-07-31 18:49:06 Yo, why god keep blessing me. I just got my tire fixed and oil changed for free.
2314 2018-07-31 18:49:04 CBD oil works for me(and apparently 1,000 other people who’ve replied to you lol). If I’m having an extra rough day, I can usually turn on a favorite show or listen to a podcast to help keep my mind from wandering. You’ll figure out what works for you and be back on track soon 
2315 2018-07-31 18:49:00 No they liars , he pushing free HEalthcare , yet opposes coal , pipeline ,drilling for oil . So how can steel stay in business ?

2317 2018-07-31 18:48:51 i wuv how oilix n lack of oil supplies is a plot point in mg2 and its literally never brought up ever again
2318 2018-07-31 18:48:31 At least oil won't short out the insides, I guess? (I wouldn't take a chance either)
2319 2018-07-31 18:48:19 I get a free car wash whenever I take my vehicle in for an oil change!  And they have doughnuts!!  
2320 2018-07-31 18:48:17 Time for a special #SouthTexas edition of #TriviaTuesday! In how many Eagle Ford Shale counties do oil and natural gas production take place?

2329 2018-07-31 18:47:04 Noella, great question, we left energy lands off at the last minute ...BUT plan on a subsequent energy acreage graphic. The majority of onshore oil & gas leasing (100M acres +) occurs on farm and range land ...It was confusing to some showing these overlapping areas

2363 2018-07-31 18:41:59 UAE is much more advanced than Qatar in projects. They also started these projects before Qatar. Thing is they do them because their Oil is running out and they want to make money off Tourism.

2366 2018-07-31 18:41:15 I know I couldn't sleep last night with trump & Putin selling off all his gas and oil,  remember the good ole days when President Obama was in office & refugees still had their kids, water wasn't questionable. PEACE of mind what a blessing.
2367 2018-07-31 18:41:15 Loving my holidays eating salads..ALL DAY! Why or why does everybody cook the very VEGAN POTATO chip in  animal fat?? and if it is vegetable oil they share it with deep fried meat?!???  I'm on holiday- I WANT CHIPS!!
2368 2018-07-31 18:41:10 I agree - we should research a bit. Niger’s current refinery (Zinder) borders Nigeria at Kano. Niger’s oil consumption stood at 7k bpd at 2010 refining capacity is 10k bpd in 2012. So if we build a refinery, we can’t sell inland but export. Does the northern market justify...
2369 2018-07-31 18:41:08 I don't know why we are required to even use E10 when it is corrosive, reduces mileage and performance.  Why do we have it when it serves no purpose to include helping the environment.  Because of fracking we have no shortage of oil (1 reason for ethanol)

2409 2018-07-31 18:36:02 Its not nonsense its facts. We are a tiny contributor to climate change. You haven't explained how we go green without oil either you just keep saying the same stupid thing that we have to go green but dont offer how.

2434 2018-07-31 18:33:10 There will be oil soon

2442 2018-07-31 18:32:07 I remember being in elementary school and learning that America was the “melting pot” of the world. Recently it seems more like oil and water with how we separate ourselves into different categories and identities. #Tribalism

2445 2018-07-31 18:31:26 Try eating one just before it ripens and goes soft. That's the best way I've found. Subtle taste and great, slightly crisp texture. With a drizzle of oil and balsamic, and a hit of black pepper. Yummy.
2446 2018-07-31 18:31:23 After the anticipated Oct run-up, it’s time to start plotting on the oil and edible companies ... trust
2447 2018-07-31 18:31:11 I've no idea why folk do this when the oil from FPSO's being classed as "other" is the much bigger story?

2456 2018-07-31 18:30:35 I put castor oil on this morning, not lots but enough to cover base and give my hair a shine. 

I won't put on for the rest of the week, might put some on again on Tuesday.

2459 2018-07-31 18:30:27 It's time to move away from petroleum and to clean energy. The Oil industry has had its day.
2460 2018-07-31 18:30:18 Correlation usually strong:
1- If oil GAPS higher, not grinding up
2- When oil is dropping. This one is reliable; it doesn't matter if its grinding or gapping down. FX responds.

When oil "stabilises", oil fx moves on to other drivers (carry, growth RV, risk-on risk-off, etc)

It pays to pay attention to the fine details!

2506 2018-07-31 18:25:02 Have you thought about doing a small survey on common mistakes in are Home? Like using cheap nasty usb plugs . Or not replacing used oil in chip pans. Or leaving electrical items on? It could be done in a light humour. But it would still get the attention if you made it a quiz

2509 2018-07-31 18:24:47 Adulting 101: being excited you’re finally able to get an oil change and your tires rotated after not having money for it.
2510 2018-07-31 18:24:45 Valvoline now has you stay in the car during your oil change...this is weird and awkward
2511 2018-07-31 18:24:39 It's a good question whether terminology moves the dial, eg tar sands vs oil sands. More annoying are the gov't-sponsored terms like "clean growth" and "climate leadership".
2512 2018-07-31 18:24:34 Yea like “my lawn will need to be mowed soon” or “I’m 2500 miles from an oil change” but that’s about it. Not worried about him throwing picks 
2513 2018-07-31 18:24:20 "เอาที่ใกล้ที่สุดแล้วกันครับ"
"ดึกแล้ว พี่จะได้รีบพักด้วย"
เป็นเพราะค่อนข้างห่วงคนที่เพิ่งเดินทางมา บวกกับเริ่มรู้สึกง่วงแล้วจึงตัดสินใจเอาง่ายๆ อย่างนี้เลย
2514 2018-07-31 18:24:18 but how can you know they are all forced?
2515 2018-07-31 18:24:13 Hayfever season can be really bad for me.. oil rape seed I'm really allergic to (& they use the damn stuff as a base for cheap perfumes, body sprays, etc)
2516 2018-07-31 18:24:05 my mom finally went to get my damn oil change

2525 2018-07-31 18:23:03 Makes you wonder what they want to do with the land. What do companies usually like? Oil, maybe? The people must have been compensated.
2526 2018-07-31 18:22:41 And video it!
2527 2018-07-31 18:22:41 Ok, so dozens (if not hundreds at this point, see various ongoing lawsuits!) of employees at $SCTY and $TSLA are just making these allegations up? 

Or is it part of a giant conspiracy against the company? Saboteurs and Big Oil moles within Tesla? 

Let me know your theory...
2528 2018-07-31 18:22:39 2) The swarm of slugs attaches to the person and extends beyond them for 5 feet as the slugs fling themselves about. this swarm has 35 HP and deals no damage but creatures that are within it must make DC 18 fortitude save or be sickened. this oil may be applied as a standard
2529 2018-07-31 18:22:27 and i repeat marriage under 12 is a rarity among muslim communities in europe and many are actually against underage marriage... so they'd be the ones criticizing you lol

2534 2018-07-31 18:21:21 the youngest i heard of was only 11 years old... thats a borderline age... many are still children at 11 while others are more like 13 years olds (so adolescents)
2535 2018-07-31 18:21:14 Is being a woman a disability? Asking for the human rights complaint I'm drafting (oil and gas needs to get with the times)...
2536 2018-07-31 18:21:09 My problem is anyone who supports a racist, homophobic, misogynistic snake oil salesman who rips children from their parent's for cheap political gain.
The fact that he can't string two words together without lying, has debased the office of POTUS, that he revels in destroying
2537 2018-07-31 18:20:56 Do read history to know who is playing master of roster to destabilize the peace upon discovery of oil wealth in the region alongw Israel. Passing apology by Tony Blair or a regret by U.S on account of 2004 invasion won't heal the unbearable pain inflicted on millions of Arabs.
2538 2018-07-31 18:20:53 Took my car for an oil yesterday now all of a sudden I got an extra 4,00 miles on my car wtf
2539 2018-07-31 18:20:21 United States has made life horrible in gulf countries, for their addiction of oil. They gave birth to Taliban n Bin-laden. They gave birth to terrorism. Now they terrorising the world with CAATSA. United States is the "mother of all terrorism". CAATSA should be removed.
2540 2018-07-31 18:20:17 Technically, Scotland can’t raise loans, so no deficit. We spend what we raise in tax. We don’t actually receive all taxes due from Oil and Exports.  This is a moot point to be argued over later.
Spain. Not a problem, as by that point we’ll be a UN recognised country.  /1
2541 2018-07-31 18:20:16 French friend’s French mum did this...

• Cover with water (they float) & boil under lid (no salt) till base soft

• Eat w simple dressing >

3-oil (good olive) to 1-vinegar (good white wine)

spoon-edge smooth Dijon-mustard

spoon-edge castor-sugar

no salt

Never fails, epic.

2545 2018-07-31 18:19:46 1) this slimy oil attracts slugs of all kinds, however, Banana Slugs specifically are filled with vigor and are treated as if under the effects of Haste. within 1d4 minutes enough slugs appear and swarm the creature donned with this oil.

2548 2018-07-31 18:19:23 I am at fuel stations several times a week for work yet I just coasted to the fuel pump.  I literally work for a convenience store chain/oil company and can’t remember to fill up my poor thirsty car.
2549 2018-07-31 18:19:17 3weeks you say? Go to the Two oil producing LGAs in Imo state (Oguta, Ogaji/Egbema) who has remained in total darkness for decades. Yet their oil is drained.
2550 2018-07-31 18:19:12 Gee oil? Indians perfected ghee oil years ago so fair ball to all involved... 
2551 2018-07-31 18:19:10 PAUL you are incorrect. It is a oilfield. Oil makes you do weird things. USA has some oil as well good luck for the future. We only have natural gas... NL that's like laughing gas   but with more burning sensation
2552 2018-07-31 18:19:06 Acne more often affects skin with a greater number of oil glands; these areas include the face, the upper part of the chest, and the back.

2558 2018-07-31 18:18:30 THE US & CIA WAGE WARS FOR GOD.
Where G stands for gold, O for oil & D for drugs. In 2007 a plane crashed in Maxico had 4 tons of cocain loaded on it. Toda in Afghanistan US army guards the poppy crops & CIA is the transporter. The easiest way to smuggle drugs.
2559 2018-07-31 18:18:24 Adulting sucks.!!! My paycheck hit my bank 11 hours ago, and more than half of it is already gone, thanks to bills, and the fact that my jeep needed new tires, an oil change, and a new battery.

2562 2018-07-31 18:17:57 I had some classmates tell me how to change my oil recently. When they told me how easy & cheap it was to do it on my own, I vowed to show my daughter as well. I feel like nowadays we need to know how to do these things.

2569 2018-07-31 18:17:10 We share a love for biking and outdoors.  I want someone that will protect those areas and not sell them out to oil interests.
2570 2018-07-31 18:17:09 We’re self funded now by the money we make, people moan when we use oil money, people moan when we make our own money 
2571 2018-07-31 18:17:02 Grape seed oil is number one for health benefits ...amazing to cook with!!
2572 2018-07-31 18:16:46 For me the biggest teams are still Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal. Chelsea and Man City were both bought by oil money and don't have the best history compared to the teams I've mentioned
2573 2018-07-31 18:16:38 Nope, I managed with a mix of olive oil and sunflower oil
2574 2018-07-31 18:16:36 I wouldn’t even try messing with the hot oil, I get burned enough as it is from the oil that pops out of the pan whilst makin the food
2575 2018-07-31 18:16:24 Idk why men assume women know nothing about cars. I’m checking my oil and in the time it took to do that, 3 men asked me if i needed help. Like thank you, but i got this.
2576 2018-07-31 18:16:21 Eastgate World HQ has been cut off from the world today by an oil spill (!)  Continuing work on innovative software despite environmental cleanup.

2578 2018-07-31 18:15:50 @ClareMalone could Iran sanctions be to drive up oil prices to help Putin’s domestic situation as the oil based Russian economy stalls?

2582 2018-07-31 18:15:36 I love when I take my car to get an oil change and i find that the guys working on it changed the station of my radio to classical music. Like I’m expecting country music or hard rock, but maybe they work better with that soft piano? Idk, do you boo 
2583 2018-07-31 18:15:31 Klein did when oil prices were a quarter of what they are today, there's no reason we can't
2584 2018-07-31 18:15:28 (of course, you can do some oil/gas on federal lands. But that acreage pales in comparison to the vast wilderness holdings of the Feds here)
2585 2018-07-31 18:15:23 41% of all US oil comes from Canada, Electricity that basically powers all the state of New York is needed from Canadian Hydro. We’re America’s largest Natural Gas provider and America’s largest source of precious uranium.  Etc. Etc. We have lots of aces in the hole.
2586 2018-07-31 18:15:14 What is jojoba oil?

2589 2018-07-31 18:14:26 I hope to goodness you left your children abroad to leave more room for olives and wine and brie. Gouda is now a currency in parts of the Home Counties and a small bottle of olive oil will soon buy a house in Rawtenstall
2590 2018-07-31 18:14:17 We need a WORLD WIDE REVOLUTION, THIS CRAP IS CANCER SPREADING ACROSS THE WORLD. I LOVE ALL OF NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. CANADA IS BEAUTIFUL ALONG WITH THE PEOPLE. But the people who are now in charge suck. I want to like Justin,but from his actions with oil and the NATIVES?POSER!
2591 2018-07-31 18:14:08 Yet they won an election against your party of socially conservative hatemongers, and business is fine in industries not being targeted by OPEC or Russia.

I know you'd be more successful if you supported refining the oil here. But please don't let reason cloud your politicking.
2592 2018-07-31 18:14:06 Gotta Love oil paint
2593 2018-07-31 18:14:06 @DanaPerino They need to take Facebook down permanently. Anybody w/ a life doesn't use it anyway. And who pays attention to a hack like Mark Warner / my god he has enough oil in his nose to run my Prius for a year. Shut down Facebook !
2594 2018-07-31 18:13:53 Yes. I add a drop of lemon juice and olive oil on mine :)

2596 2018-07-31 18:13:45 Oil and gas development is relatively small, in actual acreage. The largest "use" of Alaska, by far, is various kinds of federal FWS, NPS, and BLM holdings. The Feds own between 61% and 68% of Alaskan land, depending on whom you ask.
2597 2018-07-31 18:13:28 Amitabh Bachan is a unique character, first he says go buy jewelry from Kalayn Jewelry's.

Then he says go to Muthoot fiance and pledge them.

Finally if you have tension in repaying the loan use Navratna hair oil and drive away worries. #AmitabhBachchan #lol
2598 2018-07-31 18:13:25 When the price of crude oil was higher.... Over a $100 PB, we were paying less for fuel and less for subsidy. 
Now the price of oil is at $40 PB, why then are we paying more for fuel and more for subsidy? What then is the effect of the fall? Are we paying for what was lost?

2603 2018-07-31 18:12:39 Popcorns are normally fried in the same pot , the same oil and with the same heat conditions but they don't pop at the same time , your time isn't my time ,but we will all pop !!
2604 2018-07-31 18:12:27 Anyone who believes that these socialists will stop robbing you when they begin robbing Big Oil should study Venezuela.

Socialists are thieves.
2605 2018-07-31 18:12:16 and physically not at their peak for bearing children regardless of the BoObBieS 
But then they'd have to wonder why female humans start to develop breasts so early (average age 9-10) if they are literally kids till at least 17 (for the most precoscious)
2606 2018-07-31 18:12:11 Kana anointing oil yakaramba kushanda here. My sisteris just a sore loser. Accept defeat and move on Dudu. Thank God people from that ward didn’t vote for you

2608 2018-07-31 18:11:29 Most urbanites would be stunned to learn of the mixed use of land, such as cattle grazing under giant windmills and crops growing around oil wells.
Might want to add water storage, transportation, and use to that map, too.
2609 2018-07-31 18:11:15 Correct and a smiley by Rahul added  oil to fire .. even though I have a different ideology which makes me away from.DmK cheif.. this pic makes a sad face . As rightly said should have been avoided . Thatha looks great in his yellow shawl and kakruppu kannnadi no doubht.
2610 2018-07-31 18:10:39 This is about GM cotton -seeds are used to make cooking oil .. which is adulterated with cooking oil

And the left out over GM BT cotton seed pulp is feed  to animals for milk and meat 

So you decide what you want to .. I am happy letting dairy go from my home.
2611 2018-07-31 18:10:23 …ぐぅ
2612 2018-07-31 18:10:17 I'm looking at countries like Singapore and Denmark, neither of which have large natural resources to build a nation, and yet, they're major hubs of economic commerce.

Yet, there are places like Venezuela and Guinea with large oil reserves that are basically failed states. Why?
2613 2018-07-31 18:10:07 @EdwerderRFA it still amazes me that people think only Republicans are in bed with big oil companies or pharmaceutical companies it's a joke

Nice to meet you slipper, Nora I don't like your friend, she is a oil bich. 
2618 2018-07-31 18:09:36 religious people can't understand human are far from being perfectly made, it would ruin their "intelligent design" theory.

2619 2018-07-31 18:09:30 The whole idea of #Techloyalty is giving credit to the folks who burned the midnight oil creating software for everyone to use. Chief among sloyalties in the #techcommunity is reserved for #TextEditors like #Vi and #Emacs !
2620 2018-07-31 18:09:26 Oil - 70 bucks act a very strong resistance and i see oil upside is limited and downside is a lot bigger than here

2623 2018-07-31 18:09:18 Go the Protein World route. Or @GoldmundUnlesh Camera Game route. I don't know you'll do it with Olive Oil but I'm sure there's a way. 1) Piss off SJWs 2) Get "exposed/doxxed" by bloggers for BuzzFeed, Jezebel, etc 3) Profit
2624 2018-07-31 18:09:12 I love it!! The pink oil moisturizer one though! I hate the smell of it to this day 
2625 2018-07-31 18:08:58 Diesel is very similar to cooking (sunflower) oil and is nowhere near as hazardous  as petroleum. Those containers look remarkably similar to the ones containing cooking oil on supermarket shelves to me.  This tweet shows lack of education in the police force.
2626 2018-07-31 18:08:56 6 years ago, I ran out of oil while cooking. I went to the kiosk to buy one. I wanted to buy the entire 10 ltrs. The man refused to sell to me because he didn't want to disappoint his other customers. His words - "oga, e go finish if you buy all." Amazing.
2627 2018-07-31 18:08:50 What happened to the players that sold our oil reserves?
2628 2018-07-31 18:08:33 Roast in the oven....with some Olive Oil ;0)
2629 2018-07-31 18:08:26 As it turned out, THEY DID!!  He slipped on a oil spot, instead of jumping up onto the hood of his friends car!!! Jimmy Kimmel had him on the show by phone last night!!  Silly fella!!
2630 2018-07-31 18:08:23 .@AndrewGillum Thank you for signing the pledge to protect FL from dangerous #fracking, #offshoredrilling, and refusing campaign funds from Big Oil & Gas
2631 2018-07-31 18:08:20 ok so instagram advertised tea tree oil as the solution for all my problems so if this doesn't work I will be mad
2632 2018-07-31 18:08:00 Congratulations @MrAbuSidiq as our New spokesperson @APCNigeria @APCUKingdom @OfficialAPCNg
2633 2018-07-31 18:07:53 This is tragic! Everyone in this admin is only interested in one thing: Money! And if destroying our land will make them more, that's fine with them. Our country will be just one big pipeline of oil to feed the rich. Bad air & water plentiful!

2636 2018-07-31 18:07:36 The economic slump of the late 60’s and 70’s oil embargo/stagflation slowed down growth, soooooo?
2637 2018-07-31 18:07:34 It'll probably go like this:
-Stock footage of sitting at computer
-Screen closeup of "Downloading AR-15_ghost_gun_w30magazineclip.zip"
-Send intern out to buy Airsoft AR lookalike
- Next day headline: "We downloaded an AR-15 from the internet!"

2639 2018-07-31 18:07:21 We aren't suggesting a ban on all oil & gas activities, but we do want them banned in established marine protected areas. You can't protect areas and species while development of this nature is taking place as it can be quite disruptive to the ecosystems.
2640 2018-07-31 18:07:19 Yes i been trying to get that for forever like some oil or the plant?
2641 2018-07-31 18:07:16 @JoeManchinWV can easily vote NO, his reason being: I voted for Gorsuch,BUT Kavanaugh believes: NO Heathcare for poor; that Oil & Gas companies can legally take control of private citizens’ lands,AND Kavanaugh would toss out WV Counties’ lawsuits of Opioid mfg. companies.
2642 2018-07-31 18:07:08 side note: Gunnar Myrdal was responsible for pushing the Swedish Social Democrats to the right by dropping nationalization of oil, shoe manufacturing (?) and *deprivatization of healthcare* from their platform as Minister of Commerce so it's no wonder the CAA picked him up.
2643 2018-07-31 18:07:02 I used castor oil, box braids and hair vitamins to make my hair grow faster from those ugly awkward stages after a pixie cut
2644 2018-07-31 18:06:44 It is a beautiful coastline. But so is the BC coastline until oil pipelines destroy that beauty. #carbonfee #nopipelines #Keepitintheground
2645 2018-07-31 18:06:28 The CAD wasn't this weak the last time oil was this high. I wonder what the difference is now... 
2646 2018-07-31 18:06:25 I got 56 minutes left until I can clock out with my cock out
Boa I’ve been up for 24 hours
I’ve smoked 2 blunts, crazy amounts of oil, worked 2 shifts, had multiple conversations, beat my dick a couple times over the threshold of self pleasure. Man it’s been eventful :)
2647 2018-07-31 18:06:18 Delightful dinner. I have the olive oil on my sleeve to prove it.

2655 2018-07-31 18:04:39 also at 15 i was not fit physically for intercourse, and i started puberty at 8-9.
most of these girls got no clue what sex is even when they're 16. they dont self-explore because "its haram". how can they then know they're ready for sex?
2656 2018-07-31 18:04:38 Idk but yeah it might be the water or oil
2657 2018-07-31 18:04:34 California gets a lot of mileage from ignorance like “Wyoming’s got as many senators as we do!” Texas hasn’t been making similar rumblings. Maybe when President Ocasio-Cortez declares oil illegal.
2658 2018-07-31 18:04:33 Girlll literally olive oil eco styler gel mixed with this edge paste from Aveda Institute, a hard bristle brush and two scarves to tie it down. The trick for me is also section my hair into fours and gel down the back two sections as well.
2659 2018-07-31 18:04:25 Loyola and Mater Dei are like oil and water.  Mater Dei spent millions on a basketball/athletic facility...Loyola, millions on a Science Center...I’ll just let that sink in to which school values what more.  Trophies vs Education (btw, Loyola has plenty of trophies)
2660 2018-07-31 18:04:22 I don’t really do it anymore. My eyes &, hands won’t cooperate but I did calligraphy, pen & ink, pastel, pencil,charcoal,watercolor, oil.

2667 2018-07-31 18:03:54 How is that not true? Those are facts. Fort McMurray is the pulse of the province as far as oil activity goes and those numbers are awful. Or because a stat doesn’t appeal to you it’s trolling?

2669 2018-07-31 18:03:46 The perfect date night you ask me? 

Soft good music, live or through good crystal speakers. 

A bomb ass meal.

If you’re fetching an extra mile - an oil portrait of me showcasing simple joy.

& bottomless laughs, wine & rounds to serenade us in forever of this. 
2670 2018-07-31 18:03:45 I'm using my lavender oil and laughter therapy right now for a neckache. It's great. LOL
2671 2018-07-31 18:03:33 See ya! True Oilers fans support the team through the good and definitely the bad. Oil Country doesn't need you.
2672 2018-07-31 18:03:26 and they tend to be worse mothers. it's not a human thing only . young mothers among mammals are often neglective to the point of killing all their progeny.
the last thing humanity needs is more people with ptsd, depression etc  , be it the young brides or the offspring
2673 2018-07-31 18:03:20 We use the same. Along with their oil.
2674 2018-07-31 18:03:20 If that interests you:
Big oil ownership of car manufacturers shares and their conflict of interest in getting off oil.
I've read Arabic wealth funds have big stakes in VW and Daimler (possibly others) and how they exercise their ownership. Same with banks who hold oil & auto
2675 2018-07-31 18:03:06 Or how about reinstating stricter regulations on off shore oil drilling. If the Bush administration hadn’t used Hurricane Katrina as an excuse to deregulate Gulf Coast drilling then perhaps the Deepwater Horizon oil spoil could have been prevented.
2676 2018-07-31 18:02:59 2-3 hours for an oil change pls help 
2677 2018-07-31 18:02:53 I'm leaking & burning oil. Exhaust blowing... yet it went straight though last year..almost dropped dead. I'll still chuck £50 at the fucker for a MOT .. no warning lights ..it's done 120,000
2678 2018-07-31 18:02:31 As soon as that Trump Puss Ridden Hormone Milk hits our shores it will be mixed with the Cheap Rainforest Blitzing Extinction Palm Oil to make delicious chocolate for the masses. Bigger Bonus, less Quality, less Environment, less Species.
2679 2018-07-31 18:02:26 Nice one. 

I’m cooking the wife’s slimming world way, so no oil allowed. 

I agree, it’s disappointing

2681 2018-07-31 18:02:00 Before leaving for college, get a “thorough” maintenance for your child's car.  Milestone servicing is needed every 15,000 miles. Along with an oil change, your mechanic should look at all of the car’s belts, coolant system, brakes, shocks and struts, and transmission.
2682 2018-07-31 18:01:53  she and the Tullow oil people are dying inside  screaming corruption upandan
2683 2018-07-31 18:01:52 Your nation was far worse before you guys found oil lol.
2684 2018-07-31 18:01:50 Except in countries that have robust social and public services like Iceland, Norway and Finland. They're not socialist, but they do guarantee a lot of basic needs. 

Venezuela also isn't socialist, I suggest you look up Maduro's cabinet that is made up of many private oil barons
2685 2018-07-31 18:01:48 The Cdn ecoterrorists are only out to stop Cdn oil  because it makes them feel righteous. Noting to do with the environment. They bought & paid for by foreign interests who are making money at Canada's expense. This is an orchestrated effort to bankrupt us & PM is complicit.
2686 2018-07-31 18:01:44 #Democrats are constantly forming circular firing squads for 2020 campaign.What American would vote4 socialist Democrat candidates?Their plan is to Make America Venezuela.Oil made that country wealthy til thr politicians socialist policies transformed it into impoverished nation.
2687 2018-07-31 18:01:39 What is happening in APC is just the "Truth rising above falsehood as oil above water."- Miguel de Cervantes. All the Rats will eventually leave and any governor that decamps does that at his peril..Every is armed with his PVC waiting. Sai Baba!!
2688 2018-07-31 18:01:38 Ah - good for her! Tell Alex, then, to brace himself, and you do the same.  I also have a lovely car-related story from this morning. It involves me going for an oil change, getting a $595 estimate, involuntarily crying (MORTIFYING), & finding out that Tuesday is Ladies’ Day.
2689 2018-07-31 18:01:31 *99 out of 100
2690 2018-07-31 18:01:21 White culture is believing coconut oil is the answer to EVERYTHING
2691 2018-07-31 18:01:11 That is right. The NATURAL CAUSES = Trudeau and Notley, the biggest hypocrites Canada can offer.
While US and Russia make record profits on oil. Texas to become world 3rd biggest supplier.
2692 2018-07-31 18:01:08 not really, they are 99 out of 10 over 12 so real child-marriage is a rarity.
i agree 9 is a child and 15 almost a woman , though more similar to children in some aspects. 
but at 15 bad experiences have a far higher impact than as an adult simply because you're still developing
2693 2018-07-31 18:01:07 @visrane it's not only people of Ktaka Mhrstra. Goans are doing it rampantly too. Please take steps and arrest the menace of dangerous adulteration.

2695 2018-07-31 18:00:31 So, what do you figure the revision likely indicates? Over-exaggerated production coupled with significantly more over-exaggerated exports?

Positive adjustment of 216k + 307k bpd revision down in the 914 monthly is a whole lot of oil. Phantom exports or phantom demand?

2697 2018-07-31 18:00:26 Yes, certainly oil & coal should pay hefty portion, but the pain needs to be felt in every sector. I’d favor GHG tax on CO2 & CH4 emissions w/ funds earmarked 4 helping utilities/others increase renewable usage, mitigation. I think it has 2 get worse before ppl react voluntarily.
2698 2018-07-31 18:00:23 "Wilson Labour WM gov chose & imposed technical & organisation solutions on industry not reflecting shipbuilding in competitors Japan & Sweden. This fatally damaged Scot shipbuilding in a time of demand for very large oil carriers & supertankers" (After UofG. Connors 2009)

2701 2018-07-31 18:00:10 Drizzle of olive oil. 25 mins in a roasting hot oven. Pasta?
2702 2018-07-31 18:00:00 Oil, salt and in the oven. Or bin it and order pizza.
2703 2018-07-31 17:59:56 Mayo with a touch of olive oil
2704 2018-07-31 17:59:55 Not only that... Now, we're about to get a oil shortage thru slavery ID card.
2705 2018-07-31 17:59:44 I've been using coconut oil on my face and my goodness I feel dumb for not using it sooner
2706 2018-07-31 17:59:39 Oil prices have since rebounded and most investment has left the building. Face the facts, regulations from these govs are chasing investment away.
2707 2018-07-31 17:59:30 I literally huff lavender oil before walking into work
2708 2018-07-31 17:59:30 $CL_F Pretty low for the day to short back but, took a chance again shorting 68.94 $DWT #Oil
2709 2018-07-31 17:59:23 Interesting. I didnt know this. Good thing I didnt start using coconut oil as a face scrub.
2710 2018-07-31 17:59:20 It’s a good day when you get your oil changed and nothing else is wrong with your car
2711 2018-07-31 17:59:10 When I turned my car on this morning the dashboard warned me my oil was too low, up next was the service light and then the engine management light because my fuel pump needs replacing. Does my car want anything else from me?

It did, fuel light 20 mins later.
2712 2018-07-31 17:59:07 good point. Would be interesting to add those states & include the amount of land being used for gas & oil production.
2713 2018-07-31 17:59:01 Just makeup removing oil and a tweezer but the glue was not budging and it just kept ripping the hair :/
2714 2018-07-31 17:58:55 I have an oil painting on ply board of my uncle as a teenager, done by Alex Garlands father....tenuous enough?
2715 2018-07-31 17:58:42 And I thought Israelis puts too much oil on just about everything . Now I want to try eating ice cream with oil but I’m too scared to try new things
2716 2018-07-31 17:58:38 เหมือนจะเข้าใจแล้วครับ
2717 2018-07-31 17:58:18 A good economic indicator when it comes to oil sands health: YMM airport recently laid off staff to a current number of 12. Down from 77 3 years ago. Down 350k passengers. That’s a telling stat of oil sands health
2718 2018-07-31 17:58:14 This kind of ban always makes me feel torn: I want a clean environment but I also want the revenue that oil/gas brings in!
2719 2018-07-31 17:58:11 Guac and chips, guac in a burrito, or just sliced avocados with some olive oil and a lil salt !!
2720 2018-07-31 17:58:04 It helped shem. Less oil and breakouts
2721 2018-07-31 17:57:54 I’m bout to treat myself to an oil change 
2722 2018-07-31 17:57:49 NYT is an establishment voice, which means they will ignore or gloss over the corrupting influence of big oil & gas money in politics as much as possible. They don't want to offend their honorable cohorts in the esteemed government of these United States.
2723 2018-07-31 17:57:46 Use creamy baby oil instead of regular lotion.... I swear it works!
2724 2018-07-31 17:57:43 I wish I could send you the unaltered oil we have available here. Their olives are to die for. Plain or stuffed. I might see if they have a handout I can send you. It has to have a super amount of the healthy ingredients. Like a splash  on a tomato is all you need
2725 2018-07-31 17:57:25 Coconut oil works great to remove makeup! I used it in my eyes when I was practicing my makeup for a Halloween costume.

Due to last pest's disruption, I've to reiterate what I mentioned before.
I'm not a prophet so my comments cannot be always right. That said, I am not a pundit so my comments cannot be wrong all the time.
2727 2018-07-31 17:57:01 We have modular power packs that will run an entirely electric oil drilling rig

Let’s use them for a renewable energy fest instead

2729 2018-07-31 17:56:51 I use a vitamin c serum, my sister put me on to lavender and jojoba oil. So I alternate between the two. Also use a toner before I apply those things, Mario badescu got a few options, the rest of the stuff I got off Amazon.

2735 2018-07-31 17:56:20 What? China immediately implemented retaliatory tariffs (trump just promises 12B to farmers to help mitigate the effects). Now they signed an oil/nat. gas deal with Iran so they don't have to buy from us.
2736 2018-07-31 17:56:16 Maybe it was because it was extra virgin olive oil. I’ve used olive oil products before 
2737 2018-07-31 17:56:11 Hey y'all I'm currently interning at Audubon Companies, they're an engineering firm in the oil and gas industry. They're currently actively hiring people across all departments. If y'all know anyone in engineering or oil and gas pass on the word and have em go apply.
2738 2018-07-31 17:56:00 I believe it's actually pretty common and it's very good! Doesn't work with every oil I guess but I know it's amazing with pumpkin seed oil and olive oil and I guess even coconut oil would work 
2739 2018-07-31 17:55:31 & I added it into my oil mixture.  I’ll just give it to my mom to use 
2740 2018-07-31 17:55:30 Don't let the fact that oil prices dropping is what caused that, and has zero to do with Alberta.

2745 2018-07-31 17:54:15 3-5x a day tbh I just did it whenever I would remember. A drop or two on a q-tip and i’d run water on top because that oil is so strong it needs to be diluted
2746 2018-07-31 17:54:14 Lmaooo yo how awkward was it trying to explain to this court officer that it’s just a big ass lube bottle in my purse and not cannabis oil 
2747 2018-07-31 17:54:11 Don’t let the numbers such as 89 billion in cancelled projects and 27 billion in divestments get in the way of a good argument. All while our neighbor to the south is having an oil boom.
2748 2018-07-31 17:54:06 You KNOW you eating hard when you get coconut oil in your eye!! *ouch*

Oh well... at least I got these lashes off! 
2749 2018-07-31 17:53:59 South Main Street is feeling very dark, even with just the lift shafts put up and I have to say the student accommodation on western road is no oil painting or even architectural masterpiece. Basically they are building visually challenging buildings
2750 2018-07-31 17:53:51 Are oil companies

a. entities that cause oil spills and fund right-wing think tanks

b. producers of the fuel that keeps the world economy churning
2751 2018-07-31 17:53:42 I am a survivor and I use fresh water fish oil. For me, it has been life changing. From dark to light within days.

2753 2018-07-31 17:53:28 Are you in sense?? How is BJP benefiting from fule  price? Did IOC,BPCL and other oil companies are giving profile to ruling party, Didi congress earn when they were in power from fule price hike??
2754 2018-07-31 17:53:18 Conman he's trying to make us buy snake oil or worse a Kinect 3.0
2755 2018-07-31 17:52:39 Insurance companies do not provide healthcare. They hedge against something that might happen. Covering something that is a certainty is not insurance. That’s like getting oil insurance for your car.
2756 2018-07-31 17:52:37 it explains why the us is obsessed with oil in every way
2757 2018-07-31 17:52:30 As far as eating out, extreme low carb (>50g/day) requires a little creativity but is totally doable if you’re willing to sacrifice a bit. Eggs, meat, cheese, salads, and ask for sides of butter or olive oil for anything. Seems smaller volume but more calorically dense/filling.

2764 2018-07-31 17:52:08 Why is @Mobil1 Extended Performance High Mileage Motor Oil not offered in 10W 30.?

Even the Mobil 1 Website recommends 10W 30 for my vehicle..

I don't get it.
2765 2018-07-31 17:52:00 They got plenty of oil money to fix That. They should be thanking us daily

2767 2018-07-31 17:51:49 I emailed PM Stephen Harper back in 2009 to hurry and build pipelines to our east and west coast and be the "Tim Hortons" of oil...forget about keystone as Obama doesnt want Canada to excel in the industry... why are we so stupid.

2783 2018-07-31 17:50:38 She'd rather have Canada import oil from the Middle East; Rather develop our own natural resources. We lose so much money cause we can't get out Oil to the world markets. 
She can sit down now.

2794 2018-07-31 17:49:09 Livestock farming accounts for over a quarter of human-generated methane emissions. So, in all seriousness, as long as we're not just burning straight crude oil, just about anything other than livestock farming would be better.

1) Massage the dark underarms with coconut oil.

2) Leave it on for up to 15 minutes.
Wash it off with mild soap and lukewarm water.

3) Repeat two or three times daily until you achieve the desired results.

2804 2018-07-31 17:48:19 Don't touch your face with the palms of your hands. Dirt, oil, and bacteria can get clogged in your pores which causes acne.
2805 2018-07-31 17:48:19 the whole situation surrounding medical use cannabis oil being illegal just confuses me, surely we already have drugs in use that have more serious effects on the body, what is this government honestly afraid of i don’t get it???

2830 2018-07-31 17:45:39  It's a valid question though; there are no olive oil plants
2831 2018-07-31 17:45:38 @DavidGlennShow I would switch gears quickly my friend having this discussion on radio? Politics and sports are like oil and water these days.
2832 2018-07-31 17:45:35 Nah, that makes it worse for me. 
On a sunny day, I start sweating on my palms and feet, minutes after using an oil based lotion. 

Thanks though.

2861 2018-07-31 17:41:48 Agree. Most of what "ails" us is "non healthcare system" dependent. You rotate ur tires n change ur oil, you rarely need the mechanic. I will keep saying it isn't about healthcare. It's about "Caring About Health."  #medtwitter #health #hcldr

Unfortunately, the mindless enviro-left don't take their blinders off and see that it's FOREIGN oil/gas interests that are pushing the Cdn anti-oil lobby
2867 2018-07-31 17:41:05 It seems you forgot the billions in cancelled oil sands expansions and many foreign owners abandoning ship. But other than that yeah things are just humming in the oil sector here.....as in heading south to hum.

2869 2018-07-31 17:40:43 I can't. What's the point when you can get it at home anyway. There is one thing that converted me to Toblerone, though it's not an issue in NZ, its it doesn't use palm oil, which is rare for chocolate in the UK from supermarkets, but as I said not such an issue in NZ

He told Germany Chancellor Merkel to stop paying $400B/yr to Russia for gas & oil but instead buy from USA.

2886 2018-07-31 17:39:11 DE is actually quite effective. If you have carpet you should vacuum THEN sprinkle/rub it into carpet with a broom (the vacuum stimulates flea eggs to hatch). Cedar oil also works well, look up a product called "Wondercide" that is safe to spray on pets and furniture :3

2892 2018-07-31 17:38:22 They have mature oil & gas wells in the North Sea as well as significant agricultural exports to other countries. Additionally, Denmark does not have a set minimum wage. I get what you’re saying and agree that they do a lot of things right, but this graphic is lazy and incorrect.
2893 2018-07-31 17:38:18 No thanks! I already know we send more money there than we get back & that's not even the oil they leech away to.

Why don't you stick to your original complaint & go reply what you think of your unionist pals displays of hate & bigotry to a peaceful march?

2939 2018-07-31 17:30:55 Oil price had to change to adjust to the inflation caused by the government’s faulty actions, they were afraid to actually make big noticeable changes to it (they even tried subsidizing their own oil btw) because they were afraid there would be another “Caracazo”

It would be like auto ins covering oil changes.

body oil contamination caused the breakdown of the colour, finish coat.... 

remove oil build up, stabilise and refinish, now it's not so noticeable.
2992 2018-07-31 17:25:20 Yeah ill have to follow that philosophy. I had to use the dealership the first few years since there were so many problems with the car. Aside from warranty claims they just change my oil now. I had to redo their brake job myself

2997 2018-07-31 17:24:28 But they still had to change their oil price based from the competition of the world capitalist market. The state was owning some, not all, of the oil, not the actual workers or the communities themselves. Thus Venezuela isn't truly socialist, but rather state capitalist.

3000 2018-07-31 17:24:02 Now she's under @lisamurkowski on Twitter. Due to her being the Senator for Alaska, it's mind-boggling to try to think through her need to drill in the Arctic for oil.

3004 2018-07-31 17:23:47 And don't even get me started on tariffs. The retaliatory tariffs China put on our seafood exports is going to really hurt us already trying to work out of a recession. Yes while the rest of the country prospers were still in a recession up here because of the low oil prices.

3013 2018-07-31 17:23:05 You've got that precisely opposite.  Its the GOP that stops regulation on oil companies even as they spend MILLIONS to brainwash folks oil is the food of life when its actually a dangerous drug that will destroy California.
3014 2018-07-31 17:23:02 Has coal done anything to improve the climate, what about oil spills?  Ask the Gulf of Mexico about their opinions about BP and fossil fuel...
3015 2018-07-31 17:22:57 My make and model year are notorious for timing chain issues cause the cars drink oil like a fursuitter drinks water lol. And it's where the noise is coming from its where the timing chain tensioner is.

3017 2018-07-31 17:22:40 Have you looked into CBD oil? Might help?

3019 2018-07-31 17:22:18 Sitting in the waiting room getting my oil changed and being forced to watch Sesame Street.  I never appreciated the storylines before but as an adult these are very well done for teaching topics that may be harder to explain without experiencing.
3020 2018-07-31 17:22:18 If oil is impeded from sea transport, demand for what is available in storage will spike. If the future price is higher than the today price, hoarding oil occurs. Short term prices soar and fuel trading gets volatile.

3027 2018-07-31 17:21:46  oh so oil yo weakness
3028 2018-07-31 17:21:28 On a side note, it sounds like you (as with me) had the good fortune to watch the Gretzky/Messier Oilers and the 5 Cups. Not to mention the 2006 run to the Finals.

I sometimes wonder what it must be like to be a recent fan of the Oil, someone who didn't get to experience the
3029 2018-07-31 17:21:23 Super late to the party but I just finally got one of those oil pens and I luv it 
3030 2018-07-31 17:21:22 I change my own oil so not 100% sure of how practical this is in a shop like that, but they probably drain everything into a pan they can bring it over after change. You can just peer in to look for metal (air bubbles are ok), no need to get hands dirty.
3031 2018-07-31 17:21:21 To blast and blame Oil companies for Climate Change (aka Gore Global Warming) - the ironey of the hypocrisy is deafening!
3032 2018-07-31 17:21:19 i just found out you have to change your oil every year
3033 2018-07-31 17:21:12 One might ask why every home is Scotland has not received a flier about McCrone.
AND ALSO IN THAT FLIER
More positive things about Scotland's great future because the past is gone.
With or without oil, Scotland is a VERY wealthy Nation and that is an absolute fact.
3034 2018-07-31 17:20:57 At least 2 within a hundred miles of my house. And yes most is exported to CA and Asia. So I get the problem. It's just b.s. to be paying these prices and shipping all our oil out of state. Big oil gets rich doing that and we end up paying the hiked up price.
3035 2018-07-31 17:20:55 Rub Jasmine oil with carrier oil on Uterus. Eat 1/4 cup soaked raw pumpkin seeds.
3036 2018-07-31 17:20:49 Lololol!  An oil lemming! Not really. I don't care about oil. I just want my engine to make some noise and deliver performance.

The biggest smugs are still the Elon lemmings! Can't beat that, even if I wanted to.
3037 2018-07-31 17:20:42 @TheView #HotTopics #LobsterDay  Pssst, over here! Republicans are working on 12 separate bills to dismantle Endangered Species Act  by September 30. Sage-grouse turf happens to be Western Governors’ oil and gas lands. #Fracking #SageGrouse #EndangeredSpecies
3038 2018-07-31 17:20:36 That pink oil moisturizer with a bomb ass brush equals a banging ass ponytail 
3039 2018-07-31 17:20:35 And higher subsidy. In other words,bench mark at NA is set at$40 per barrel4d budget, but oil is $65,yet we r paying more for fuel and more for subsidy than budgeted. How does that make any sense?Think about it please
3040 2018-07-31 17:20:23 I have some walnut oil.. what can I cook with this???
3041 2018-07-31 17:20:21 Very Large Crude Carriers are the Pipelines of the Sea. When you can't move your oil on a boat its like closing a valve on the world economy. Red Sea & Hormuz are terms you should research right now, before NOV 4.
3042 2018-07-31 17:20:15 Rinsing conditioner after washing your body leaves all that oil and residue on your skin, it can cause breakouts if you have sensitive skin so I always condition, wash my face so the conditioner can sit, rinse my face and hair and then wash my body. 
3043 2018-07-31 17:20:15 @lesbriankang also this is the cleansing + oil set i'm currently using. i've been washing my face with the cleansing oil and sponge since late last year now and it works pretty well (i replace the sponge every 2 months). if you drop this in your cart + sign up for an account
3044 2018-07-31 17:20:15 I tone with apple cider not the green toner.. I use their oil and the serum for moisturizing
3045 2018-07-31 17:20:07 I have no words for why you desire to drill in Arctic Region in Spring when animals breed, & want to trophy kill for tourism. Money can never replace another oil spill in Alaska. How much is enough, to kill all species? & why?
3046 2018-07-31 17:20:07 Aye it runs on the choke. It was going to be one of a couple of problems. No oil pissing out anywhere so probably carb issue! Cheers bud 
3047 2018-07-31 17:20:03 Today I burnt myself with cooking oil. 
Wifey chronicles 
3048 2018-07-31 17:19:52 I can talk as proper and polite as I want to but baby let me say “ oil , orange or sink “ and all my New Orleans jump clean out of me
3049 2018-07-31 17:19:50 Just imagine putting on so much garlic mayo you cause a fucking oil crisis
3050 2018-07-31 17:19:43 How about just put water and oil in the fucker next time ?
3051 2018-07-31 17:19:15 I make my own mayo using avocado oil. It's easy and literally takes me 2 minutes.
Mayo made with bacon grease will solidify in the fridge.
Though about using chia seed oil, which is low in omega 6 and high in 3's, but it's super expensive. Like almost $250 a gallon expensive.

3055 2018-07-31 17:18:50 Before the change just ask them to show you the old oil and filter. You can say you want to look for any metal shavings, which is a normal enough thing to look for (and bad if there are any!). Legally they have to give you parts they replace, so they should at least show you.
3056 2018-07-31 17:18:46 By all means, keep challenging him. One reason this snake oil salesman has been peddling his crap for so long is because people wouldn't call him on it
3057 2018-07-31 17:18:45 Once they start to benefit from it they will stop being hostile to each other. There is no obstacle taking Saudi oil through Egypt or maybe through Jordan and Israel.

3065 2018-07-31 17:18:18 Brother,pls let me explain,as u don't seem to get. Buhari said subsidy was a scam. Nigeria in deliberating budget,sets a crude oil figure n works on that basis. Now imagine a situation where the figure set for crude oil is higher,n we r paying higher price 4fuel part 1

3069 2018-07-31 17:17:54 I’m sitting at the mechanics waiting for an oil change and they have the local news on. This elder woman is reacting to every story like “oooh” “ahhh” “oh my!” And it’s sooo precious.

3087 2018-07-31 17:15:14 1/ "data is the new oil" is a dumb meme that obscures more than it reveals. Yes, data (like oil) is an input that needs to be processed before it becomes really valuable. But you know what other inputs need processing to add value? Every intermediate good ever.
3088 2018-07-31 17:15:12 one of my heroes, John Berger writes "an oil painting belongs to the cultural heritage; it is a reminder of what it means to be a cultivated European", i mean you can just quote him over and over and it would apply here

3096 2018-07-31 17:14:20 When I left my house this morning I thought I was just dropping off my toddler and getting an oil change, so it didn’t seem like a problem that I was unshowered and wearing a blue/white striped button down and crimson FC Barcelona soccer shorts.

3104 2018-07-31 17:13:10 Maybe. You might also be giving too much weight to a narrative that climate scientists are trying to pull a fast one on us, and not enough weight to their models and data. The bias of oil companies is obvious. The bias of scientists is countered by incentives internal to Science.
3105 2018-07-31 17:13:08 Since when a oil change and tire rotation take over a hour 
3106 2018-07-31 17:13:06 What if I told you Countries that don't export oil today will be the largest source for marginal barrels produced in 2020 and beyond, and the price per barrel they sell it for will be 2.5X todays price.
3107 2018-07-31 17:13:04 He's the former minister for the Environment in Spain, from the conservative party, he benefited oil and fracking, and he's also been blamed as an oil lobbyst (he and his family have been involved in the oil business).

3116 2018-07-31 17:12:36 And that's only the beginning. Which is why it sounded like a great idea to Donald Trump, Super Deal-Maker, to run an oil pipeline over the Oglala Aquifer that feeds half the world.

3143 2018-07-31 17:09:50 my belief has always been that the massive decline rates associated with tight oil production will impact the future growth (as all basins have a finite supply of services/locations/geology). This roll over is still early; let’s see how it looks in a couple months.
3144 2018-07-31 17:09:39 Always fun taking the car in for oil change and being recommended to do $1000 of maintenance. Vehicle ownership has been painful

3156 2018-07-31 17:07:58 Also smoked salmon and cream cheese (can be cheap if you get the messy bits of smoked salmon) with capers for wow-factor.

3164 2018-07-31 17:06:24 I don't need a study I was on Medicaid, it sucks. My doctor told me that Beth Israel won't even take it anymore as they pay so little. They never paid for my breast cancer surgery, I had to get real insurance for that. Don't sell snake oil to the masses.
3165 2018-07-31 17:06:14 Does this mean oil is being naughty and getting above itself? 
3166 2018-07-31 17:06:02 Sadly the American public was not as gullible then. Nixon was a snake oil salesman. The public saw right through his BS. @realDonaldTrump has taken the "con job" to a whole new level, with a large portion of the population unprepared to critically assess his BS.

In other words, quit adhering to a "no safe dose" assertion created and promoted by oil & gas interests to slow nuclear energy

But your an obedient and dedicated lemming- and that’s good!

3197 2018-07-31 17:01:59 I'm not trying to be rude, but I am heavily skeptical because the details are so vague and confusing. I'm open to being pleasantly surprised by the product if it outperforms my current understanding, but as it is, it sounds like snake oil, no offense.
3198 2018-07-31 17:01:59 Skin it most likely. Shark skin is so sleek it doesn't allow bacteria to stay on it. If you've ever been in a hospital, the leather seats of their chairs are most likely made of the stuff.

That and shark liver oil. Super healthy, last I heard.

3203 2018-07-31 17:01:56 Iran doesn't get it.  If they'd agree to a summit in Tehran, throw Trump a parade, agree to build a Trump hotel, and allow him to claim total victory, we'd give them their nukes, buy their oil at 50% over market, and 40% of the US would become huge fans of Supreme Leader Khamenei

3248 2018-07-31 16:57:35 Iraq had American help in that stalemate, while Iran has since greatly improved its capabilities. Tehran says it will block the Persian Gulf and cut the flow of much needed oil to the West. Then, it gets dangerous!

3273 2018-07-31 16:54:32 Them: tea tree oil is good for your skin. Very purifying. 

Me: doesn’t dilute, pours straight onto face, showers in it, gets washed clean of all sins.
3274 2018-07-31 16:54:25 Man everytime I come and get my oil changed they keep trying to get me to pay for more and more stuff.
3275 2018-07-31 16:54:21 Lol it’s definitely different for guys but damn oil spill?! Lmaoooo
3276 2018-07-31 16:54:18 Derek is my favorite Giant not named Brandon. Too bad his middle name isn’t Brandon. He’s silly and fun and wears his socks the right way and was not afraid to go shirtless and douse himself in baby oil to promote voting for Belt.

3278 2018-07-31 16:54:13 Yo I’m bout to make some donuts and I’m using the last of a two year mix of various strains all up in em. Then I’m taking the oil from my faulty vape cart and infusing that with the homemade frosting. And then I’m gonna run up on your girl and whisper some wild shit in her ear...
3279 2018-07-31 16:54:04 The only issue right now is grid storage because those sources don’t produce great on demand energy. Shifting the subsidies the oil and gas industry gets toward developing better storage would be an insanely good idea.

3293 2018-07-31 16:52:29 here's what's fascinating about that from the whole "Russia owns the GOP" perspective.  Russia has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world, skewed towards taxing extraction industries (esp. oil and gas) something like 45%.

3296 2018-07-31 16:51:54 when i did IT in Abuja , i was constanly broke to the point i gave up body lotion and started using vaseline or oil to rub , to add to the suffering the firm i was doing the IT was not paying.
3297 2018-07-31 16:51:37 we may be forced to drink our oil and again even the power to charge the cars we don't have. I pity my country
3298 2018-07-31 16:51:31 You couldn’t really bully me lol I just took it as hating... called me Haitian, midnight, oil spill 
3299 2018-07-31 16:51:27 For 16 years PDP ruled Nigerians looted $500 billion oil funds. Their politicians were buying oil wells. Enriching themselves while Nigerians suffer. How long has APC ruled Nigerians? You gangs of hypocrite and looters will never rule Nigeria again forever. PDP are thieves!
3300 2018-07-31 16:51:25 Projects that have been dormant since before I was born are being revived. Agricultural sector, energy sector, manufacturing industries etc. What's your source of FX as a nation. Just oil. We were a consumer nation. Dumping ground for others. Rice from Malaysia.
3301 2018-07-31 16:51:12 Told a guy at work that I knew how to change my own oil and he then told me my balls were bigger than his
3302 2018-07-31 16:51:02 That whole family is bizarrely inconsistent. Father makes his fortune by selling oil tech to the USSR and also confounded the JBS. Now the children make big bux off of globalism and fear monger against it.
3303 2018-07-31 16:50:59 I had my oil changed a couple weeks ago, like not even a full 6 weeks ago and I just took my car to get a lil check up before Canada and they said I was out of oil???
3304 2018-07-31 16:50:59 Millions of people are harmed by listening to RDs, all accredited. I would have been one of them, but their high-carb, gain-based, low-fat, pro-veggie oil mantra did not ring true for me. I found a better way. 

Luckily I did my own research & experimentation.
3305 2018-07-31 16:50:51 Watching your vlogs Kiko. Think of ideas to make you busy and not be sad 
3306 2018-07-31 16:50:45 I smell like oil and fuel on a consistent basis
3307 2018-07-31 16:50:42 it was stated in quaran 1400 yrs ago water will be scarce. I'd supreme Court going to prove Allah wrong?
3308 2018-07-31 16:50:38 And what is wrong with that? Russia is one of the best if not the best in technical areas, building, medical, technology etc. few russians depend on oil revenue, that’s used by the government to protect self determination
3309 2018-07-31 16:50:37 I this u should monitor business news on TV the daily performance of these stocks are usually aired , okomu oil is among the lookers today
3310 2018-07-31 16:50:28 Malaysia is better run than Nigeria. Plus, they used their competitive advantage better than Nigeria. Both countries had oil palm plantations, but Nigeria focused on crude oil while Malaysia didn’t and you can see the difference.
3311 2018-07-31 16:50:25 Receive the oil of favour.
To make your face to shine.
To make you happy in life.
To make you light the world 
To make you help many.

3312 2018-07-31 16:50:19 Particularly here in Texas, the activist community has done an amazing job of inflating its power. After HB40 we were assured of a massive grassroots resistance. What actually happened? Texas is competing with Saudi Arabia for total oil production.
3313 2018-07-31 16:50:17 People wonder why Nigeria can’t be like Dubai. Nigeria makes as much, if not much more money in oil than the tiny middle eastern nation of the UAE. The thing we lack, that the UAE has, is honour.

3332 2018-07-31 16:48:49 I know someone who sells CBD oil made in MI for $50 a vial (1 oz, each recommended dose is .5 ml). It helps me with mood elevation and relaxation. Let me know if you want me to grab you some.
3333 2018-07-31 16:48:46 @realDonaldTrump why can't you be the first ever person on this planet to tell the world we don't need oil or gas. We can generate electricity through a dynamo system. Life would be better without greed.

3351 2018-07-31 16:46:57 I was surprised that oil wells and refineries didn't get big enough to show up.  I guess it's just really noticeable where it is, and isn't in as many places as I thought

My concern is whether China manipulates US food & energy markets to buy them up & increase exports to China et al. tariff free.

I know China has below-market deals for NG/oil, so why not food?

Regardless, have any powder mages ever tried it to see? How did that go for them?
3403 2018-07-31 16:42:24 I've heard of plenty changing from Yes to No for 2 main reasons:
1) the demise of the oil industry;
2) indy is too much on top of Brexit.
This has been reinforced by the Growth Commission Report which has been widely reported as a plan for at least 10 years of austerity max.
3404 2018-07-31 16:42:22 I also need to get the oil changed in my vehicle.
3405 2018-07-31 16:42:06 Honestly I don’t even think mayo with olive oil is represented.  It looks like there are a bunch of light, but not super light shades, two medium shades and two dark shades and the undertones are completely off.  Where are the medium and olive shades they were talking about?

3407 2018-07-31 16:42:01 You do understand that oil companies are needed so that wind turbines can run and be properly maintained?
3408 2018-07-31 16:41:46 My pleasure! Impact of oil prices on expected revenue from energy in $TSLA from 2019. It is one of your areas of expertise and we can learn a lot from you. The new planned Panasonic GF expansion and China may be data points of interest.

3410 2018-07-31 16:41:43 why do i get anxiety at the oil change place? like why?

3415 2018-07-31 16:41:10 People wonder why Nigeria can’t be like Dubai. Nigeria makes as much, if not much more money in oil than the tiny middle eastern nation of the UAE. The thing we lack, that the UAE has, is honour.
3416 2018-07-31 16:41:05 Thanks for update TKL
3417 2018-07-31 16:41:02 Actual figures are Canada is in capital flight and that Canada's GDP growth is one half of the United States and Canada GDP growth is largely the result of oil and gas and real estate. Team Trudeau has accomplished nothing
3418 2018-07-31 16:40:44 No idea if it helps, but here are things I'm doing to help it. 

-ZMA supplement: magnesium, zinc, and B complex to help sleep (I feel less anxiety in morning)
-Constant yoga, at least 20 minutes a day
-Going to try fish oil and turmeric for brain function/inflammation of cells

3421 2018-07-31 16:40:22 As for the "retard" slang, it's used to offend and mock people also children that are mentally handicapped. Which again is morally wrong. It does "trigger" me, it's disgusting to hurt someone (in any way.) that is incapable of defending themselves.

3427 2018-07-31 16:39:49 $NFX - wonder if there is anything to bumping the call time up tomorrow to 7:30 am CST from the normal 10.  Street mix consensus looks optimistically high for oil at 44%. hmm.
3428 2018-07-31 16:39:45 What part of “this is this cars first oil change and I’m not sure how it is running quite yet” don’t these people get 
3429 2018-07-31 16:39:28 Lolllllll true but you gotta try home cooked Bengali food... the restaurants are not a patch on homemade chicken or lamb curry plus it’s more watery so not too much oil 
3430 2018-07-31 16:39:18 I won’t ask u about oil changes or car maintenance and you don’t ask me abt which curtains I’m putting up...everybody has to pick a lane and stay in tht mf unless nothing is ever going to work. trying to do tht while remaining considerate of the other person is the real challenge

3432 2018-07-31 16:39:07 I boil water and put eucalyptus oil in it and then drape a towel over my head over the bowl to make a little steam-tent. It really helps soothe and loosen any mucus

3437 2018-07-31 16:38:20 I will say this has made me glad DHL isn’t delivering mine until today.

3443 2018-07-31 16:38:04 The 2018 ballot initiative to require a 2,500ft buffer zone from an oil and gas development would be devastating to Colorado. Glad to hear Brauchler stand up for the #oilandgas industry. #COPolitics

3450 2018-07-31 16:37:23 I’m not understanding your question re: the oil spill and it’s connection to this. The two have nothing to do with one another.
3451 2018-07-31 16:37:20 Fude, I love a free lunch as much as the next guy but I've worked with big budgets fir too many years to buy the snake oil
3452 2018-07-31 16:37:15 That happened to me then when I got my oil change the dude was like you need to get your tires rotated 
3453 2018-07-31 16:37:10 You would think I’m not Indian with the way this lob is taking so long to grow out. Coconut Oil to the rescue.
3454 2018-07-31 16:37:10 NOT GOOD! They’re going to pull out fresh water, and pump their disgusting polluted water back into the ground.  Do these oil and gas chuckle heads have another planet they’re not telling us about? Does the state not have access to AM’s shady biz practices?  Otter sold us out.
3455 2018-07-31 16:37:09 $100b of this evil wasted money, provided to home owners as 0% loans, could add 15 gigawatts of free solar power to the grid. AT NO COST TO TAXPAYERS. Providing manufacturing and installation jobs to 10s of thousands of American workers and lessening America’s need for oil wars.

3457 2018-07-31 16:36:50 The fact that politicians they back are climate change deniers isn't incidental to the tax cuts, it is instrumental. They were fundamental in proliferating climate change denial as to not hurt their oil biz.

3460 2018-07-31 16:36:21 I would stick to olive oil, avocado oil, &, possibly modest amounts of coconut oil over processed cooking oils, like soybean, corn, sunflower, safflower etc.Lots of olive oil fraud though. Some are diluted w/ cheaper oils Do your research before buying olive oil.

3470 2018-07-31 16:35:07 The Petroleum Services Association of Canada has cut its forecasted number of wells expected to be drilled this year from 7,400 to 6,900.

3479 2018-07-31 16:33:54 And Britain gives tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash to China 
About £26 billion has gone to Russia in loans and other agreements to secure oil, this is why I no longer donate ...:(((
3480 2018-07-31 16:33:54 Come on now, fish oil pills aren't that bad.
3481 2018-07-31 16:33:50 Yeah I know. They add palm oil to chocolates. I guess it’s cheaper to make with it but I can’t eat that either. I’ve greatly reduced my red meat intake, too.

3489 2018-07-31 16:33:07 Crude oil prices will go up perhaps 85-90$ why?
Because: Oil prices has become cheap because:
1-Iran rejected Trump ‘offer 
2-trade war between USA and China eased 
3-low supply from Libya,Iran,Fenzewela,Angola,Canada and Arabia Saudi cut 100,000 b\d from August 
4-strong USA gdp
3490 2018-07-31 16:33:06 I think that's about as much anyone could meaningfully achieve in such a moment. There is no substitute for the voluntary pursuit of education & those who claim otherwise are selling soundbites and snake oil.

I worked for 1 of his Accountants in the late 80s/early 90s. I've met him, been to Mar-A-Lago. He's nothing but a lying, cheating, snake oil selling
3497 2018-07-31 16:32:35 I fully believe if I put an essential oil over my phone as I follow the link, I will win. I also need to take my Plexus pills.
3498 2018-07-31 16:32:30 In my house the dining table is so useless, it's used for any other thing than eating.  We keep anointing oil, drugs, books, keys, bible etc on it.. Does it happen in urs?

3500 2018-07-31 16:32:16 It's technically OK yup! It just absolutely does not capture the appeal of the subject. And I believe someone who thinks a generic but realistic oil painting is more impressive than great sprite art is not able to process aesthetics on a deeper level.

3543 2018-07-31 16:28:18 He hasn't  changed anything than concentrate power to himself , an economy that's only dependent on oil and that's still in recession to date. No Russian is allowed to to speak or critique. It's a country that's powerful to you from outside but that's really bad to its people.

3551 2018-07-31 16:27:28 Yes, but if the disastrous election of Trump has revealed one thing, it is that a chronic lack of education and health leads to ill-informed citizens who are easily fooled by snake oil salesmen.
3552 2018-07-31 16:27:27 Yes he has when he was here in my town I went to his meeting just to inform myself he praised the oil field workers here then went to Austin saying renewables are the future and we need to end fracking  that did not get past me  he’s a liar
3553 2018-07-31 16:27:25 Just started using rose oil on my face and I’m liking the outcome! Let’s see how it is for the whole week. 
3554 2018-07-31 16:27:21 I think it is more complicated. Powerful people represent large corporations. Large corporations do not have strategy; they cannot think; they just are. Corporations grow, and when they cannot grow in the marketplace, they grow into government. Just end big oil now.

3684 2018-07-31 16:12:35 pt.3 @SenLisaMurkowski Why would you want to take chances where there are so few that can speak out to save Endangered Species? Why do you need to drill for oil on the Arctic Barrier Region? Every action has a reaction. Blowing up precious land for drilling oil is not fair at all

3703 2018-07-31 16:10:30 There are no train tracks to China. The twinning of the line to Westridge is about loading oil tankers with toxic and highly flammable sludge and sending these through Metro Vancouver 7X’s more than they are now...and that’s just for starters!

3708 2018-07-31 16:10:01 Sprawl aside, Is there going to be an oil boom again to support this kind of growth?
3709 2018-07-31 16:10:00 In 4 months Iranian #rial lost 50% due to US sanctions. August 6, foreign companies will stop working with Iran. The reduction of oil exports will continue the economic collapse. The country is experiencing mass protests, but Americans want a revolution! The Arab spring still on?

3716 2018-07-31 16:09:26 I feel like the place I work is one of the only places where someone can say "smell my hand" and people do so without question. 

I work for a candle manufacturer so it's either a new essential oil OR they've seen the opportunity for an awful prank.
3717 2018-07-31 16:09:25 I mix with olive oil,it works so well
3718 2018-07-31 16:09:25 brother.. understand dat lack of economic opportunities doesnt stop the president from protecting the lives of his citizens. not does it or crude oil price stop him from persecuting killers or implementing ranching rather allowing herders invade ppls land.
3719 2018-07-31 16:09:20 So I've heard, friends in the area say they are seeing a few signs but seems Robert Francis has mad some enemy's in the oil fields with his stance against fracking etc.

2. Buy olive oil, onions & limes

3. Swim

4. Go on pilgrimage across the alkaline flats until stumbling upon a rusted spade, then dig until hitting a black gush. Taste it. It is not oil but ink. Use it to transform reality.

3801 2018-07-31 16:00:29 Jackrabbits, horses, cows, road runners , snakes, lizards, ground squirrels, coyotes, and hogs were the only wildlife I’ve seen in the oil patch up until today. I’m adding deer and a pissed off badger within 100 feet of each other to that list. I could host my own nature show.
3802 2018-07-31 16:00:20 Everything in this world is BETTER with truffle oil!!!!!

3804 2018-07-31 16:00:12 @realDonaldTrump What are your thoughts on imposing bottle returns on milk jugs and water bottles nationwide to increase recycling and decrease pollution in our oceans?  Along with cleaning our oceans, it will reduce the amount of imported foreign oil used to produce plastic.
3805 2018-07-31 16:00:07 I have to agree with this. But please for the love of all that is holy get off Koch oil and let us go GREEN.

3809 2018-07-31 15:59:59 Adulting at its finest is being excited you got birthday money you can use for an oil change, car registration, and a new air filter. 
3810 2018-07-31 15:59:56 Basic food was available until 80s because USSR imported grain since 60s IIRC. In the beginning, they paid with the gold looted from previous government; after that has ended, crude oil became profitable; after oil prices fell, USSR took large credits...
3811 2018-07-31 15:59:47 What ever crazed fantasy Jones is using to flog his snake oil this week?
3812 2018-07-31 15:59:44 no tv, no cooking for those Americans that don’t have gas, no hospital equipment working, no trafic lights, no airports working. If we all had solar panels he could not control the whole country. But Trump admin has taken away all help investment into this and pushes oil for his

3818 2018-07-31 15:58:59 Iran is a tough nut to crack.  It will probably take more than a bad economy to break their spirit.  We might have to resort to a naval blockade that prevents Turkey and other countries from buying their oil, in violation of US sanctions
3819 2018-07-31 15:58:58 ทุกครั้งที่คุยกันแม้จะแค่ประโยคเดียว ทำไมจิตตกแล้วดีฟได้ขนาดนี้วะ ทำไมคนๆนึงต้องมีผลต่อคนๆนึงมากขนาดนี้ด้วย
3820 2018-07-31 15:58:48 You replied to his comment, on the article above.. Actually you said they were up for debate. Why couldn't you comment about how horrible the situation is?

3823 2018-07-31 15:58:15 I think it was Shakespeare that said, "a turd is a turd is a turd". I agree that seniors are smarter than @RepTomMacArthur gives them credit for and can see past his talk. They know snake oil salesman when they see one.
3824 2018-07-31 15:58:07 Mfs who work in the oil field swear they’re the shit, just because they make a lot of moneyyou have to check mfs on the daily.
3825 2018-07-31 15:58:01 TYLER!!! This oil painting came out GREAT! <3 <3 <3 I am super impressed!! Will I be able to see it physically anywhere?
3826 2018-07-31 15:57:57 Key drivers behind Cda's strong GDP numbers in May: higher oilsands production, higher oil prices, and US-driven export growth. Trudeau govt policies: hostility to oil industry, while using 'Trump hate' votes to snub US trade deal. Insanity.
3827 2018-07-31 15:57:52 A free carry to develop a multi-well programme in one of the world's most prolific gas basins surely can't be bad news, yet the market disagrees.  Keen to know if Jay is also looking for oil in their next drill and when Kiliwani will be back onstream. Hold his feet to the fire!

3834 2018-07-31 15:56:57 ARE YOU FOR REAL ? 
You are pushing the porcupine caribou in the Arctic Wildlife into extinction and wiping out their ENTIRE migratory route and breeding areas with oil drilling you sold the rights to there( to big Trump campaign donors $$$$$)
3835 2018-07-31 15:56:55 Also, his idea of saving the environment entails bringing in more oil tankers.
3836 2018-07-31 15:56:55 Pre-2007 teflon has PFOA which was voluntarily recalled and replaced with PTFE. Ceramic you have to avoid overheating the oil as it will essentially season onto the pan, but because of its nature, the cooked on oil will cause everything to start sticking.
3837 2018-07-31 15:56:40 I can’t believe there is any support for NDP.  So many of these small rural towns are suffering with no oil patch work.
3838 2018-07-31 15:56:34 Omw to get a oil change

3853 2018-07-31 15:54:57 I figured the fat would help. Any risk of freezer burn or damage with the oil from the gardinerra or pepper juice?
3854 2018-07-31 15:54:54 It doesn’t come down to sanctions either, because Venezuela traded oil with a large part of the world. It was because of the socialist government literally being afraid of changing the oil price, large amounts of corruption within the government, and exploitation of gov services
3855 2018-07-31 15:54:49 This is the second time @valvoline has been careless with my oil change. But idc I get my money back for the oil change AND a free oil change the next time I go. Look at God
3856 2018-07-31 15:54:48 It's so important to teach your kids basic auto maintenance, like how to check your oil or change a tire.

Did you know Bill Cosby's son died changing a tire?

...I mean, he was shot, but that's what he was doing when it happened.
3857 2018-07-31 15:54:39 I need to research what joining OPEC means for countries with oil resources but little heavy infrastructure for drilling.
3858 2018-07-31 15:54:24 Anyone still talking about QB body language should be boiled in oil.

3860 2018-07-31 15:53:49 Use oil. You know. For supple muscles.
3861 2018-07-31 15:53:48 There's recipes on the Internet but i made some last night and it was awesome. No giant pot of hot water to drain, just noodles topped with water and a bit of oil so it doesn't boil over or stick. You have to stir it like twice through the cooking process.

3864 2018-07-31 15:53:38 "Oil prices plummeted at the same time that the [West] applied sanctions to Russia... and Russia understood that if they didn't make a deal with the Gulf Staes, oil prices would further decrease" - @RaufNMammadov #RussiaMiddleEast
3865 2018-07-31 15:53:31 So, the knight-commander... Boiling in oil? That one never gets old.

3867 2018-07-31 15:53:19 The incremental oil will continue to move by rail.  Much higher carbon footprint and spill risk.  @sierraclub should be Keystone’s biggest supporter. #reality #emissions #KeystoneXL
3868 2018-07-31 15:53:02 The vegetable oil used in our French Vanilla liquid is high oleic soybean oil and/or high oleic canola oil.
3869 2018-07-31 15:53:00 Good. Does that mean we'll return all the stolen lands from American Indians since these lands have a deep religious connection with their dead ancestors, nature, and the Great Spirit. You don't need a damn bible to be religious. Mostly remove mines and oil & gas lines pipelines.
3870 2018-07-31 15:52:51 I’m aware of the lawsuit involving six states from 1999. Yet, I can’t find another one since that time. Don’t like oil? Don’t drive a car, use a pencil, or most public transportation services.

Buhari wants to build cattle ranch in Edo state which is an oil producing state but conversely wants to build a refinery in Katsina which is a cattle rearing state... and you still wonder what is wrong with us as a country?

3935 2018-07-31 15:45:01 I’ve started adding coconut oil to my coffee in the morning and it keeps my lips so moisturized lol
3936 2018-07-31 15:44:47 Still Loling at @steph_fiorello saying my oil pen tastes like rosemary chicken 
3937 2018-07-31 15:44:47 Give me bread with olive oil and vinegar, agege bread, tea bread, bread with jam and cheese, hard bread. Any bread. I'm sold.
3938 2018-07-31 15:44:40 Northern gateway also would have done that but your gov campaigned on cancelling that. Face the facts, your gov does not want Alberta oil to move anywhere
3939 2018-07-31 15:44:35 Obviously then you are aware of the stereotype of bitter, single, vegan/vegetarian, physically unattractive women with a cat as their avatar/ profile pic

3941 2018-07-31 15:44:29 I HATE that all companies give a discount days AFTER you go. Like I just got an oil change the other day and they emailed me today saying, “thanks for the visit, $10 off your next visit.” Like no bittttttch I wanted the $10 off the DAY I was there?????
3942 2018-07-31 15:44:25 Going to the dealership for an oil change and I feel like this gone be trash.
3943 2018-07-31 15:44:24 As promised @donnabrazile: Brown 5lb sliced onions in dutch oven /2bay leaves, olive oil, remove onions, brown salted/peppered 5lb brisket, remove meat, put in half onions, beef bouillon cube, tbsp balsamic vin, 12oz beer, replace beef, onions, 300 for 4 hours. #NCSLsummit
3944 2018-07-31 15:44:20 Are you also against socialism in the form of government hand out to farmers? Oil companies? Walmart subsidizing their low paid employees? The Wall Street bailout? Corporations who literally pay zero taxes from lobby induced loopholes? Just wondering.
3945 2018-07-31 15:44:20 I know the company polluted Kansas waterways in addition to other states, mainly crude oil and petroleum products

3951 2018-07-31 15:43:41 Per me è un problema enorme anche in termini di mercato visto il monopolio dei Fang simile alla Standard Oil

3955 2018-07-31 15:43:26 Oil cost is divided into mining cost and transportation cost.On the basis of these two points, we can check and balance its development.

3961 2018-07-31 15:42:52 Likely bcos people have resumed importing cheap palm oil since USD became available again in the market.
3962 2018-07-31 15:42:46 I just injected myself with cooking oil and now my entire arm is purple. Is that bad? 
3963 2018-07-31 15:42:45 Remember hearing take the oil? Well this is take the NUKES. Trump took the Nukes in NoKo. This is now Trump's Military Base. 4D Chess!
3964 2018-07-31 15:42:24 Even @SenJohnMcCain debunked this years ago. Obama is a lifelong Christian. That’s a fact. You are a lifelong racist. Also a fact. He cleaned up the mess left by Bush and is an honorable man. Trump is a snake oil salesman who depicts the 7 Deadly Sins daily.Stop lying to yourself
3965 2018-07-31 15:42:20 Tomato slices sauteed in olive oil with basil, topped w some salt & pepper: a very improvised breakfast
3966 2018-07-31 15:42:17 One day you’re tits deep in an art history lecture, the next you’re holding oil samples in a flame retardant coverall. Life is a winding road.

3968 2018-07-31 15:42:08 Vanyo: the slowdown of Central Europe in the 1980 much more similar to what happened in Latin America etc: oil shock + debt crisis. #wehc2018

3972 2018-07-31 15:41:23 We're trained to think of it as things being worth more, but never "our" money being worth less. Also, there ARE documented instances of oil DEMAND being DOWN, but prices arbitrarily UP.  Often, it's about what we're made to believe. #Moneytheism®

3977 2018-07-31 15:40:58 Adulting: when you’re excited for a random day off because you can get the oil change you’re slightly overdue on
3978 2018-07-31 15:40:47 Or just not doing their jobs. There will be a lot more mines buried in the everyday lives of LGBTQ folks.

Need your oil changed?
Kid's got strep?
Whatever you got going on, it all depends on how medieval the person behind the counter is.
3979 2018-07-31 15:40:46 Right.  Socialism = the government owning everything (instead of workers) and pegging your currency to oil prices.  Great argument.

3989 2018-07-31 15:40:10 I’ve never seen a bookie on a pushbike, there has always been snake oil sold in the boxing game, I haven’t bothered with last few ppv’s for that reason, you can go to small shows to see cracking fights, PPV should be for the best of the best not the rest.

3992 2018-07-31 15:40:01 I have also heard that shay oil before bed can help when the beard is still short. Because some times that itch is from the relatively sharp edges of your facial hair scraping on your skin.

3998 2018-07-31 15:39:35 GUYS!!!! Vegetable oil is really REALLY bad for you!!!! It clogs a lot of your important organs and can lead to dementia/Alzheimer’s!! Use peanut or coconut oil instead!!

4008 2018-07-31 15:38:35 Oil prices being dragged down by decreasing demand. Peak travel season is closing. Hurricane season close.WTI $69 @bbl The Kochs Brent Exchange $74. IMHO, prices kept artificially higher by thousands of dark trades between cooperating oligarchs.

4029 2018-07-31 15:36:58 We’re just voters too. Cameron did an awful job. Partly because he was responsible for the awful state of the country and couldn’t admit as much. But the fact that 17.4 million thought the snake oil salesmen on the other side were telling the truth is so depressing.
4030 2018-07-31 15:36:53 I have one on right now because I have an oil treatment on my head. Keeps my shit from drying out and lookin like a flake factory.

4039 2018-07-31 15:35:51 The downtrend has commenced and hope it will last for 2/3 years. .All profits made between 2015 till now will vanish. .unless the oil prices go down
4040 2018-07-31 15:35:44 Oil crash 90% of it, brexit fears constrained investment, PBOC was trying to reel in their ccy from onshore/offshore Aug '15 debacle, and election fears typically sideline decisions.

4054 2018-07-31 15:33:55 Processed stevia is as bad as processed sugar. Its the processing, and the dhemicals used, that make it bad. If you're using stevia as your sweetener, it should be freshly pureéd organic leaf. Organic raw honey is far better than stevia. Stevia is a fad like canola oil and tofu.

4083 2018-07-31 15:30:56 Hard to choose just one.... but de-salted ‘raw’ cod with grilled red peppers and a dressing of extra virgin olive oil and garlic would definitely be one of the finalists for me!

4092 2018-07-31 15:30:15 @MeghanMcCain & @WhoopiGoldberg part of the problem with marijuana and it's usage is the smell/smoke & regulating of where it's inhaled.  If it's consumed in a different way (oil, etc.) for medicinal use or recreation it would be less of an issue.

4096 2018-07-31 15:29:53 @TheView I agree Whoopi! I take CPD oil, but proper Medical oil would further help my seizures and pain. It’s ridiculous. It’s a natural herb.  Because let me tell you seizures are not fun!

4103 2018-07-31 15:29:08 Mais.. aucun rapport ?? Le débat de base "castor oil", ici y’en a pas. Ensuite tu compares parfumerie et cosmétiques qui sont 2 mondes différents !

4105 2018-07-31 15:29:00 Tell me what did the last 4 Tory governments do to protect this province from the economic uncertainty of fluctuating oil prices. That failure to plan caused our last downturn.
4106 2018-07-31 15:28:46 The egg whites help it stay together better - I guess coconut oil could help too
4107 2018-07-31 15:28:45 Mmm. That sounds like a similar result. I halve them, drizzle with olive oil, add chopped bacon and whole garlic cloves, slat and pepper and roast in a 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes. Sometimes I add a balsamic/honey glaze that gets reduced on the stove first with rosemary.

4115 2018-07-31 15:27:34 Oil fills the tabernacle and anoints prophets. Oil is associated with priest, King, and prophet. The main association is with the Spirit. So, all of the above. I don’t believe almond is a common enough association with “life”. Oil on bread - Spirit and Word.
4116 2018-07-31 15:27:17 I've brewed up my own garlic oil and it fuckin reeks and it's my favourite thing I've ever made

4130 2018-07-31 15:25:32 I have been holding $BP for a long time.  Not sure how I feel about oil in the long-term scheme of things, but for the time being, it still a good hold and I LOVE the increase :)  Looks like we both just got a 'pay raise'! #dividend #invest #smartmoney
4131 2018-07-31 15:25:31 Worst part about getting an oil change is having to sit in the waiting room and listen to these people talk and talk and talk 
4132 2018-07-31 15:25:21 thats because of collusion between oil companies...they kept the price the same but high
4133 2018-07-31 15:25:13 ติดจองแล้วค่ะ ;-;
4134 2018-07-31 15:24:49 Oil amp hahahahaha
4135 2018-07-31 15:24:38 With that said, how can one escape oil?... everything we consume has some ties. We are trying to become self selficient. Pay off debts... either we turn everything over to the bank and not pay our debtors, which would be hypocritical too, or he continues until we settle things.
4136 2018-07-31 15:24:36 there’s an olive this! in charlotte that jodi goes to all the fucking time and it’s super good but also they can go fuck themselves you already have an olive oil job?

4140 2018-07-31 15:24:13 Hey David! Every season it is a good to remove the pump plunger and oil the pump cup. If the cup is leather, take your thumb and spread it out, then soak in leather oil for a few minutes. If the cup is neoprene, oil it with light machine oil such as 3 in 1 or a light motor oil.
4141 2018-07-31 15:24:07 With @ONGC_ @CMD_ONGC having bought out @HPCL at INR 36915 Crores under pressure from Jeb-loot-li & PMO, controversial GSPC assets buy out & depleting oil assets, this is another AIR INDIA in making.

4146 2018-07-31 15:23:42 From what I've gathered, olive primarily reps the annointing oil for the Davidic Messiahs - sight vs blind, light vs dark kind of stuff.
4147 2018-07-31 15:23:40 Cannabis oil is one form of medicinal marijuana, Meghan. Why can't you just let someone make their point without you adding your unnecessary, unasked-for 2 cents? #TheView

4150 2018-07-31 15:23:25 Didn't Guderian strongly advise against Kursk. Some brain parasite had totally infected the Fuhrer's mind. Even before, when he went for Stalingrad (totally worthless strategically) instead of fully focusing on the oil rich Caucasus.

& if so, who the fuck do I hand it in to, in bloody Tunbridge Wells?!

4159 2018-07-31 15:22:30 Do you liked lox? Smoked salmon makes great roll ups w roasted veggies like asparagus bundles. I know you don’t like to cook but anyone can drizzle olive oil, garlic and S&P on veggies, toss & roast 425° 30 min. If you’re doing low carb, roasted/grilled veggies are your BFF.

4169 2018-07-31 15:20:42 Despite this tax, EVs are cheaper to operate than gas vehicles. No oil. No oil changes. I get 4.2 miles/kwh. I charge up overnight with special off-peak electric prices that are less than 5 cents/kwh. And it's soooo quiet. New ones go farther, but my 80 mi. tether is fine.

I guess... shooting oil and making digitally articulated black slime seems like a thankless, hard-fought concept. But it can be done you're right.
4175 2018-07-31 15:19:56 @SAEditorsForum  should be asking @SAgovnews as to why poorer countries than us buy fuel from us and sell it very cheaply compared to us. Someone needs to explain that @SakinaKamwendo 

I just think that oil prices have little to do with it, syndicate operation are profiteering.
4176 2018-07-31 15:19:45 I don’t think I’ll be needing to drink much fish oil the coming winter due to all the dried fish I eat these days.

4184 2018-07-31 15:18:58 But you're okay with subsidies to the oil industry? Sorry, you can't have it both ways.
4185 2018-07-31 15:18:55 It smells very “FISHY” that crude oil prices ran up 2% yesterday and are crashing 2% today!! There is no need for explanations because no one will believe them!!
4186 2018-07-31 15:18:55 The reason IEA are getting plenty of flak is that they tacitly support views that a majority of people disagree with. They are allowing (eg Tobacco firms,
Oil companies) to funnel their PR campaigns through a purportedly benign & independent think tank. They are smokescreening.
4187 2018-07-31 15:18:51 There is the need for Nigerians to have complete attitudinal change towards Oil.

4191 2018-07-31 15:17:36 Rev says remember to make your appointment ahead of time for your autumn check for antifreeze tire check oil water in the radiator wipers - crazy weather means you must be ready!
4192 2018-07-31 15:17:32 I am not a fan of how it changes the consistency of the cheese. Pepperoni can't be by itself. Needs sausage or something to help with getting the pools of oil off of it.
4193 2018-07-31 15:17:20 If IEA made an "independent" report that questions climate change = possible millions from Oil sector, Aviation etc etc. 
If the report would prove climate change? no donors.

Your research is driven by revenue to dress up amoral corporate interests as being academically sound.
4194 2018-07-31 15:17:19 7/30:  Oil rises over 70/bbl on "supply concerns"

4196 2018-07-31 15:17:07 I think it’s a thickener? Which is why a lot of non dairy products use it. I like the nut waters, personally but if you want to add richness, consider adding a bit of coconut butter to it too- not oil.
4197 2018-07-31 15:16:47 Love the absurdity of the Left being called out. Whether it’s straws, oil, meat or whatever ridiculous “trigger” issue of the day.
4198 2018-07-31 15:16:38 Is the 'anti war' movement starting to believe its own propaganda? I think so. This is the result of reducing all issues to cheap political mantras - 'all about oil/the military industrial complex'. Or perhaps they never were anti war to begin with? Just pro something worse?

4295 2018-07-31 15:05:28 Many skin formulas designed for dark skin contain olive oil. Why? Olive oil is particularly rich and nourishing for dry skin, and it contains linoleic acid, a natural compound that helps even skin tone and fade dark patches.

4346 2018-07-31 14:59:59 Sorry but for me scientist debat must to be open. And i'm not a M.D., i'have a PhD in molecular biology, so i'm so sorry but yes homeopathy is a snake oil. You teach that, right for you but you are not a scientist and of course not a MD. Patients need truth, not faith.
4347 2018-07-31 14:59:57 They want access to oil under the Arctic Ocean, which they may be stealing already; Trump is complicit. If they can't get at it through political shenanigans, they will set their armies and navy on the shores, and we will have WWIII.
4348 2018-07-31 14:59:40 This man here getting his oil changed is smoking a cig in this beautiful weather. The smell legit makes me so nauseous I don’t understand how anyone is out here in 2018 still smoking cigarettes.

4351 2018-07-31 14:59:32 Yea it was amazing. We got in line at like 5am outside of Lucas Oil. Did the same thing for CFP game
4352 2018-07-31 14:59:28 It is our wealth, our oil, our whisky, our water, our produce that the UNION so dearly wants to keep a hold of, its not YOU @IsThisAB0t @ScotNational @Scotland_future @Always_a_Yes @YesDayScotland
4353 2018-07-31 14:59:27 I'll help. I'm disabled and on opiates and believe cbd oil could help me with my pain instead of oxycontin. I'd be happy to blog about the advantages of cannabis over tablets that make you I'll.
4354 2018-07-31 14:59:18 Global economy crashed, not just the oil price.
4355 2018-07-31 14:59:16 Sounds like Mexico is done the hacienda oil hedge.
4356 2018-07-31 14:59:14 Growth of 8 core sectors which also include fertilisers, steel, natural gas, electricity & crude oil jumps to 7-month high of 6.7% in June.

Growth rate in May was 4.3%. Then, Modi failed Economy

Now, Growth jumps to 7-month high of 6.7% in June. But No one will talk about this.

4358 2018-07-31 14:58:40 @johnwest_uk Hi, is it safe to heat up your John West Steam Cooked Mackerel Fillets in Olive Oil?
4359 2018-07-31 14:58:33 ของตัวเเถวอะไรคะ ><
4360 2018-07-31 14:58:20 No, you get to where he is by employing unscrupulous business practices, screwing others when it suits ur purposes, lying your ass off, working closely & very likely illegally w Russian oligarchs & having the sleazy charm of a snake oil salesman.
4361 2018-07-31 14:58:19 Tax breaks for oil companies, rising costs to work in the north sea etc. Regardless of oil price, the revenue only comes from company profits.
4362 2018-07-31 14:58:19 9月ごろ…

4366 2018-07-31 14:57:24 Any one oil company
4367 2018-07-31 14:57:05 Do you own a shark tank or do you personally buy homes for the poor?  Just checking your SJW oil

4371 2018-07-31 14:56:44 Pipelines are about selling oil to Asia for the oil companies. About expanding activity in the oil patch so they can twin the line to Westridge for the purpose of loading oil tankers and hauling them through Metro Vancouver more than once a day. Not good for Vancouver! #StopKM
4372 2018-07-31 14:56:40 Haha, me too. Who cares that the gas is crap and Valero specializes in high sulfur oil refining causing extra pollution.

I just love the new logo, and is always my sole creterion for selecting gas for my car.
Well done lads !
4373 2018-07-31 14:56:30 自分にも通づるものがあって聞いてて胸が痛む。。。。。ちなみに原稿の期限みたいなのはいつ頃で。。。？
4374 2018-07-31 14:56:22 Has 2+ decades of free trade really been bad for countries?Or is it possible that internal politics channelled the benefits to a select few.Perhaps it was a failure to acknowledge changes & address them. It is like refusing to change the oil in your car because it still runs.
4375 2018-07-31 14:56:19 That Towel head can take his oil and shove it
4376 2018-07-31 14:56:19 A quick glance at a timeline is often enough to tell the tale.

"You and I are oil and water." *click*

4379 2018-07-31 14:56:13 You’re so welcome! You can swap the oil for butter and toss them in brown sugar if you want to prepare them as a dessert instead. Sprinkle a little cinnamon on top and serve with ice cream and it’s like a Puerto Rican version of a banana split.
4380 2018-07-31 14:55:57 まぁ7だし3でいいや(クソ)
4381 2018-07-31 14:55:48 あと5分でデートだ……はーーーやばい無理どうしよう楽しみでやばい

4383 2018-07-31 14:55:42 mate... the stress cos people were given salt and cooking oil
4384 2018-07-31 14:55:37 #pmg and #aaog my oil picks for 2018 in that order
4385 2018-07-31 14:55:31 Yes, sorry.  The glistening garlic oil that was pouring from my pores was shining with beautiful radiance.
4386 2018-07-31 14:55:29 3 of the 50 states still use wooden water pipes, 1 state doesn't have a dam inspector, 1 state has 1 dam inspector per 7000+ dams, our infrastructure is rated D+, and remember 83.1% of our energy is from coal and oil.
4387 2018-07-31 14:55:18 That won't happen.  KSA is wealthy, developed, and gives the USA lots and lots of oil.
4388 2018-07-31 14:55:14 Certainly the speed of transfer to greener forms of energy is far too slow... however there can be no sudden halt to oil extraction due to the reliance upon it currently. If you research a little you will find Russia is looking to become greener.
4389 2018-07-31 14:55:14 @prestigiousss got this oil waiting on you 
4390 2018-07-31 14:54:59 Coconut oil isn’t lube.

4392 2018-07-31 14:54:52 Syampoo olive oil ni memang wangila... Suka betul aku pakai....
4393 2018-07-31 14:54:50 cuz like I said before this week I went three years no car payments just liability and oil changes and new tires
4394 2018-07-31 14:54:46 OLIVE OIL
apply the oil on the lashes using a clear mascara wand/ q-tips or clean fingers
 olive oil helps them grow longer and stronger 
 it contains both vitamin E and antioxidants
4395 2018-07-31 14:54:40 My 1st job was with an intl oil co. based in BKK. I was proud working in multi-national env. with a guy from JP and another from US in the same office and working remotely with peers in SG. (1/2)
4396 2018-07-31 14:54:25 You can or use coconut oil (looks like Cresco)
4397 2018-07-31 14:54:23 บางครั้งก็งงตัวเอง นี่ชั้นจำเป็นต้องเปย์ทุกอย่างที่เกี่ยวข้องกับเมนหรอ ทำไมหยุดตัวเองไม่ได้เลยยยย 555

4399 2018-07-31 14:54:19 tried to act super mature at a winery and picked up a bottle and asked a cute Israeli what it was. it was olive oil.
4400 2018-07-31 14:54:19 Switches to oil
4401 2018-07-31 14:54:19 They expect the royal treatment, talkin slick like its oil speakin
4402 2018-07-31 14:54:18 Putin agenda was a quid pro quo agreement to lift sanctions, allow Putin free rein in Ukraine & neuter NATO, weaken Western Democracies.
Putin is desperate to have Magnitsky act lifted or watered down. 

Was Trump offered a % of Exon Mobil Oil deal if sanctions lifted?
4403 2018-07-31 14:54:01 It would be fun explaining to Sessions that the main ingredient in Jesus and the disciples' anointing oil was cannabinoid-based.
4404 2018-07-31 14:53:59 I really don’t understand why people are using spf 6 carrot oil like what happened to that blue stuff that smells like holidays and literally doesn’t let you tan
4405 2018-07-31 14:53:56 席譲れ()
4406 2018-07-31 14:53:52 Mct oil stat!  keep up thegood work doc! Love ur stuff
4407 2018-07-31 14:53:33 The reason, we were under a Lab gov. They along with Unions brought this country to it’s knees. FTD’s were a new concept, so we never got the chance to use them to their full force as an independent country. The EU only let us join after N.Sea oil was found & asset stripped us
4408 2018-07-31 14:53:33 You should make it so if the player uses enough of the snake oil items you get the passive "placebo effect"
4409 2018-07-31 14:53:31 Me: mual2, jantung berdebar, sendawa terus, pusing, gelisah. Akhirnya oles2 essentials oil aja agak mendingan  Padahal minumnya ga sampe setengah gelas 
4410 2018-07-31 14:53:31 @adnickens our dear leader just attacked the Koch brothers. They have done more in philanthropy than he has earned his whole life.
4411 2018-07-31 14:53:30 まぁ日本は多額な賞金出したりとかできないから、大型の大会も大体海外頼みになってしまうらしいからな～。
4412 2018-07-31 14:53:28 Wasn't just the oil that slumped, the global economy crashed.
4413 2018-07-31 14:53:23 Try cold brew coffee.All that but less oil and acid so infinitely more tummy-friendly.
4414 2018-07-31 14:53:22 The money is in oil, gas, and coal industries. They make insane amounts of money while harming the environment. It behooves their cause to have people divided on climate change so they can continue producing pollution.
4415 2018-07-31 14:53:10 I always get so intimidated taking my car to the mechanic by myself. Like they think that because I’m female I won’t know that I shouldn’t pay $400 for an inspection/oil change. It doesn’t matter that I tell them “only do this” before they start, they keep asking for more money..
4416 2018-07-31 14:53:09 veggies

4418 2018-07-31 14:52:58 When you come in for a simple oil change and it takes an hour and 25 min to do! So slow sad really @WoodstockToyota
4419 2018-07-31 14:52:47 心と身体がバラバラになったみたいな感覚。
気持ちとしては描きたいものはたくさんあって、描く事で救われる事もわかってる。なのに身体が受け付けてくれない。どうしちゃったんだろ
4420 2018-07-31 14:52:43 I put tea tree oil on this man acne scar and he got to bitching “IT BURNS” lmaooo my mans..

4424 2018-07-31 14:52:14 A radio commercial just blurted out, "Pacific Coast Termite treats your termite with orange oil and Altriset!" and got immediately cut off by another commercial. It felt like termite speed-dating.
4425 2018-07-31 14:51:57 just slapped some coconut oil on my forehead this shit better tan tired of walking around 2toned
4426 2018-07-31 14:51:56 รอดูเธออยู่นะจ๊ะ
4427 2018-07-31 14:51:54 I just spilled half a bottle of oil on myself what else could go wrong so early
4428 2018-07-31 14:51:44 You never can tell, someone might dash you oil bloc
4429 2018-07-31 14:51:38 In fact I find tasty mixed with chilli flakes, peppercorn, lemon juice and olive oil spread on bagel or other seeded bread!!
4430 2018-07-31 14:51:38 Have you heard of @breazeallergy they can help in conjunction with standard antihistamines.  I’ve been able to stop my antihistamines and just use the oil and pillowcase now.  Hope you find something that helps 
4431 2018-07-31 14:51:36 My go-to snack is avocado & diced tomatoes with olive oil, a drop of balsamic and some spices. YUM!

4437 2018-07-31 14:51:08 I like them sweet. Preheat a skillet with a teaspoon of olive oil. Take a plantain that’s been left to ripen so the skin’s all yellow and black and then cut it in slices and throw it into the pan. Let it get nice and seared on both sides. Look up plátanos maduros for pictures.
4438 2018-07-31 14:51:03 どうしてばれた？？？？
4439 2018-07-31 14:50:50 Now who didn't see that coming?  Trump gave Kim un Jong the label and now it grew on him.  Bet any money he has had oil paintings to hang in his palace with his image and the words, "Rocket Man."
4440 2018-07-31 14:50:44 Thanks for the suggestions! I’m currently using Dr. Jart+ Dermaclear Micro Water, which is pretty good, but it still doesn’t remove all my eye makeup (I don’t wear that much, and it’s not waterproof). I will try coconut oil!

4443 2018-07-31 14:50:24 ...snake oil salesman.  Actually, it's hard to judge, considering how gullible his customers are and all.
4444 2018-07-31 14:50:22 my mom is the half essential oil mom: she'll try to use a natural remedy first but she ain't stupid if it's not working it's time for (italics) the pills
4445 2018-07-31 14:50:11 Your Latent condemnation wreaks of political oil - inability to denounce your party's racist xenophobic senate candidate wreaks of political cowardice.  #VoteDemocrat and keep Virginia decent.  @vademocrats @LeslieCockburn

4448 2018-07-31 14:49:58 I agree -let’s wrap this up, put him, his entire family and Administration in jail, so we start investigating: 
Yemen
Niger
Zinke (oil & gas) 
DeVos (student loans)
Carson (existence)
Mnuchin & Ross (insider trading /currency / rate manipulation ) 
Nunes / Rohrabacher (Treason)
4449 2018-07-31 14:49:48 アイディア浮かんでるのにそれから先に進めないあれですかね。。。？
4450 2018-07-31 14:49:41 That's partly true and partly USSR propaganda at the time.  The US parent companies had no control over the operations of the split off companies related to oil sales.
4451 2018-07-31 14:49:39 Im out of tea tree oil and won’t be able to get any until next week .... my face has to suffer for a whole week 
4452 2018-07-31 14:49:32 @JoeBiden will run with @SenWarren or @CoryBooker as VP and take the @WhiteHouse He will undress @realDonaldTrump for the snake oil salesman (sorry snake oil salesmen) for the phony and criminal he is. #TrumpPutin2020

4455 2018-07-31 14:49:21 so i need an oil change and it’s on saturday so i need to kiss my money goodbye because they’re gonna see the two scratches on the bottom side of my car and completely gut my savings account
4456 2018-07-31 14:49:16 @DrShaliniMohan2 I’m taking the sandalwood oil from past 1 month in warm water & I’m not getting any results. Is there a reason behind it ?i would also like to know the cure for hypothyroidism
4457 2018-07-31 14:49:11 Right! They are big oil big Russia & no one believes a damn thing you say.
4458 2018-07-31 14:49:11 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
4459 2018-07-31 14:49:06 State-owned doesn't mean not capitalist.

Lots of state owned companies dominate the world's oil and gas business.

Russia stopped being communist in about 1991.
4460 2018-07-31 14:49:05 Aye this nigga Ghost be off the oil tweakingggg 
4461 2018-07-31 14:48:55 India’s dream to combat pollution via electric & autonomous vehicles will surely be a nightmare to oil magnates and all those contra-environmental protection creatures, right???
4462 2018-07-31 14:48:48 チョン↑パァ！
4463 2018-07-31 14:48:43 No oil...
4464 2018-07-31 14:48:31 where can I buy beard oil and pink lips balm in Lagos here @gidi_traffic
4465 2018-07-31 14:48:29 Another way to manipulate the price of gasoline before the midterm elections would be to close some oil refineries and make excuses that they have maintenance problems be careful of Rex Tillerson
4466 2018-07-31 14:48:19 I know u must b here
4467 2018-07-31 14:48:07 I agree too. That can only happen from inside Iran though. All the US will do is impose a puppet regime who'll allow them to loot the oil.
4468 2018-07-31 14:48:01 6qts pa oil? hahahahha
4469 2018-07-31 14:47:55 feel ko bumilis oil production ng face ko. mamaaaaaaa!!!!! help
4470 2018-07-31 14:47:50 It's been less cakey than Shape Tape for me so far and makes my skin still look REALLY NICE / much better once oil starts inevitably coming through. I had another friend try it and love it too! I'm setting with their Peach Perfect powder and it's the most gorgeous finish too
4471 2018-07-31 14:47:49 Today I made a quinoa salad with a bunch of chopped veggies and some olive oil dressing with feta and I was sad bc I didn’t have any AVOCADO and it would be gr8 with the ‘cados
4472 2018-07-31 14:47:46 I think there’s been a few studies where the carotenoids in vegetables are better absorbed with oil/fat, as in a salad with dressing (as opposed to without any fat), but the ones in animal foods would seem to come along naturally packaged with fat.
4473 2018-07-31 14:47:41 Actually, the utilities in MA have not been giving incentives for oil to gas conversion. Such fuel switching with efficiency dollars has been prohibited in the efficiency programs. There are countless other more environmentally sound options that also bring economic benefits...
4474 2018-07-31 14:47:37 لاحول ولا قوة الا بالله العلي العظيم عظم الله تعالى اجرك اخ فيصل وجبر كسركم وجعله في الفردوس الأعلى من الجنة
4475 2018-07-31 14:47:24 I hope Trump nationalizes their oil refineries for the crisis you know he’s going to start.
4476 2018-07-31 14:47:19 There was still a Luftwaffe but it never caught up with UK.

Im not forgetting anything. Twatter is very limiting.

We also prevented the Nazis from getting oil etc etc.
4477 2018-07-31 14:47:18 Saudi Aramco is an oil company that makes over $1 billion of revenues in the course of just one day!

4481 2018-07-31 14:46:00 Oil was added yesterday fam
4482 2018-07-31 14:45:54 And, nearly all of the price gains are attributable to oil price increase. Transitory? Big question
4483 2018-07-31 14:45:41 Oil to 100. You heard it hear first. Gartman dont screw this up

4487 2018-07-31 14:45:20 Was wondering why you were giving him money when you dey leak oil? 
4488 2018-07-31 14:45:16 Growth of 8 core sectors which also include fertilisers, steel, natural gas, electricity & crude oil jumps to 7-month high of 6.7% in June.

Now, Growth jumps to 7-month high of 6.7% in June. But No one will talk about this.
4489 2018-07-31 14:45:11 The USSR is quite guilty of that too, tbh. Without the massive oil and grain imports from the Soviet Union, Germany's time on the Eastern Front would have been waaay shorter.

Daytrade idea: If 68.59 holds...it might be the low of the day. Bought with stops at 68.33. Last drop probably and wycoff spring. we will see.

4640 2018-07-31 14:29:27 Just hard to believe we got through $35 oil and some of these companies were even showing a profit and now at 60+ they are tanking. Unreal.
4641 2018-07-31 14:28:58 Yes, I totally believe you without question that the super rich oil barons tied to Russia are no longer your buddies and aren't flooding you with money to do their bidding. Sounds totes legit. TOTES.
4642 2018-07-31 14:28:58 My mum is really suffering from arthritic knee pain and trying to manage it by using natural alternatives to ibuprofen. I've read about the use of CBD oil for pain relief and would really like her to try these products.
4643 2018-07-31 14:28:53 plz go government should prepare thats what i can tell 5 percent diluted co2 is enough in the oil well

4646 2018-07-31 14:28:27 Ran to mechanic, no I have to fix it. I tell this dude, maybe it's the oil pump, his like nah, it's the petrol pump.
4647 2018-07-31 14:28:26 Turns out the driver was his friend, it was staged.  He hit an oil spot apparently and couldn’t slow down in time 
4648 2018-07-31 14:28:23 Excuse me but are you guys not the ones that just jumped in bed with Russia and their oil. Hypocrisy much!!! #MAGA
4649 2018-07-31 14:28:18 You better Cookie, you better.  In all honesty, I just feel like the potato donuts taste too much like the oil they’re cooked in.  It’s overpowering to me.
4650 2018-07-31 14:28:14 It does no good to pass bills if Trump will not implement it. It’s a step in the right direction. But getting enough representatives on board to override his veto will be hard to do. Congress passed a sanction Bill recently and Trump has yet to implement it. He wants Soviet oil.
4651 2018-07-31 14:28:14 Ah I suffer from that syndrome too, but I’m off to Norfolk anyway for my year of oil painting....
4652 2018-07-31 14:28:02 Another day, another giant dump in the oil and gas sector! Altagas/Pulse the only 2 green in my entire sector watchlist, oil was up yesterday and the market didn't even notice. All interest is gone.

4655 2018-07-31 14:27:39 So I heard a commercial on the radio for CBD Oil...I can't believe it...is the movement to make it legal in Indiana happening already?!?! Or am I getting too excited for nothing...

7:27 AM - 31 Jul 2018
4656 2018-07-31 14:27:36 Oil companies, like ICE auto companies, need to rapidly leverage their capital to transition away from oil and gas and toward clean energy. Luckily there's a business model for this. Unluckily, they have wasted decades by trying to delay and deny climate responses.
4657 2018-07-31 14:27:29 The person who has even seen me with no make up and oil in my hair even said she looks like you.. I gave up after that
4658 2018-07-31 14:27:28 We would have an hour long CNN Primetime special.  I suspect they have tried and realized it, but will continue to act clueless.
4659 2018-07-31 14:27:16 have you looked at other professionalised safety industries like oil /Gas ?  Friend who works there says that some of the interprofessional issues exist there too - between engineers/geologists/ - often share knowledge and skills
4660 2018-07-31 14:27:14 "Great customer service! This was my second time coming for an oil change and I will be coming back again :)" @Groupon #HappyCustomer
4661 2018-07-31 14:27:09 The siren song of oil tankers is calling me again but my goodness, can you find worse examples of corporate governance? No offense to Bill Browder but I think I’d rather invest with Russians!
4662 2018-07-31 14:27:06 Definitely get into some peppermint essential oil, dilute it in a roller bottle, apply across forehead, temples and on the back of your neck
4663 2018-07-31 14:27:02 "I had an oil change done and it was a pleasant experience.  Nelson the owner is very friendly and helpful and..." @Groupon #HappyCustomer
4664 2018-07-31 14:26:56 Germany recently restarted coal fired pwr since it can't produce enough green power for industry.  Transitions don't happen overnight and the world still runs on oil

4666 2018-07-31 14:26:39 That, IMO, is part of the story. China's hard landing and oil halving was tied to Fed talking up rate hikes that go priced into yields and pushed up dollar 20%+. Fed tightening via the dollar is missing piece of the puzzle.
4667 2018-07-31 14:26:29 That video is Soo disturbing ! What's worse is our tax dollars pay for this abuse of horses& burros .
How do these Cattoors who work for the BLM get by with this ???
Its all about right
Big money so they can run their cattle through & drill 4 oil.

4668 2018-07-31 14:26:24 The US government stopped an American oil company from doing business in Angola because it was suspected of engaging in corrupt dealings with the politicians of the country. American companies are subject to the law whether or not they’re in the US

4672 2018-07-31 14:26:09 Olive oil? Canola oil? Avocado oil? or crank case oil???

4680 2018-07-31 14:25:12 Louie it must have been a great sister-swapping party where you got these examples of disinformation.
1. ISIS is not defeated,
2. The average wage has reduced,
3. Who is claiming that there is peace in Korea and how do they support their claim?
4.  Science is making oil redundant
4681 2018-07-31 14:25:00 that shit don’t even work for me that olive oil one work good but that shit expensive as fuck
4682 2018-07-31 14:24:56 My face is so oily  like idk when my skin started producing so much oil.

4684 2018-07-31 14:24:46 There is nothing comfortable about 3.8% unemployment,  Hyperloop One,  5G,  Defeat of ISIS,  Challenges to human trafficking,  oil refineries. Where is Lebron's refinery? There is a Martinez Refinery !
4685 2018-07-31 14:24:42 The campaign of @JoeCunninghamSC for US House. He is an ocean engineer who wants to keep oil/gas exploration and drilling off the SC coast. He's running against a yes-man/Trumpist who overthrew incumbent Mark Sanford (who wasn't Trumpy enough) in the primary.
4686 2018-07-31 14:24:35 @Darkness429 hey Tim my brothers pitbull gets very on edge when people come to the door and if he can’t relax they give him a little cbd oil and helps him relax. Haven’t done the research myself but maybe you could look into it for Tyson

4692 2018-07-31 14:24:24 I find this whole " universal living wage" thing very stupid.  Mainly because its impossible. Just do the math lets say 30000 a year for everybody over the age of 16.  Yeah not even the oil rich saudis could afford.  America? Pffft not even a month.
4693 2018-07-31 14:24:21 You’re not wrong! Many a late night spent burning the midnight oil. Hope you’re keeping well my friend

4697 2018-07-31 14:23:59 Oil went from around $120/barrel to $30/barrel around that time.

4701 2018-07-31 14:23:42 Virtual Reality example: Imagine a power plant oil and gas plant. You can bring people like contractors through the space ahead of time. They know the security. They know what they are doing on equipment. Training can be done remotely without down time at the plant. #TIW18

4703 2018-07-31 14:23:00 Grand malt tastes like crude oil.
4704 2018-07-31 14:22:54 Like I said us companies have to follow us laws whether in the US or outside of the US. The US government stopped an American oil company from doing business in Angola because of suspected corruption with the leaders of the country

4706 2018-07-31 14:22:40 Currently in a private enterprise session with @taradurotoye (love you ma'm) and honestly Nigeria has remarkably capable leaders. We just don't have a system that allows them enter government. 

We are doing with our best people the same thing we have done with oil.
4707 2018-07-31 14:22:38 You're right. It's not on there is it? I was so excited to see Oil & Water I honestly didn't notice. Wonder why it didn't make the cut. It was a fabulous song
4708 2018-07-31 14:22:34 But it's true. If you think the US was in Iraq for anything other than oil company interests, you're credulous. Iraqis were not attacking the United States.
4709 2018-07-31 14:22:32 Put some clingfilm over a cup and pour a tiny bit of olive oil into it and rub it around the clingflim. crack in the egg and tie up the clingflim, whack it in the boiling pan for 2 and half minutes. Perfect
4710 2018-07-31 14:22:24 And big oil $$$.    He’s been drooling over getting his little hands into big oil $$$ for decades. Sees it as ‘real’ wealth/power as opposed to his sham veneer of it.  I knew something very bad was up the second I heard a shady oil deal was involved w Russia/Putin
4711 2018-07-31 14:22:04 wow. We're not trading oil

Remember who supported creating on NSA to spy on people?
Remember who supported #mittromney to succeed him?
and now this #MusicModernizationAct snake oil! STOP it!!
4714 2018-07-31 14:21:50 Yup, I make my own mayo (with standard non virgin olive oil) but commercial offerings tend to be rapeseed oil. And I prefer Dijon in my mayo tbh!
4715 2018-07-31 14:21:49 They got their tax cuts and deregulation for oil and gas....but didn't know that they were creating a monster....cut the funds.

4725 2018-07-31 14:21:05 Lucky you. It probably doesn't help that my dealership is a bunch of incompetents. Pretty sure they didn't change my oil two oil changes ago even though I paid for it. Trucks are their bread and butter and the Ranger looks sweet. Enjoy
4726 2018-07-31 14:21:00 My bet: EVs will mean less revenue from maintenance of ICE engines. Hybrids will still need oil changes, belts, hoses, etc. I think that's what Toyota and other manufacturers are desperate to keep.
4727 2018-07-31 14:20:25 I was falling asleep yesterday high & I was CRAVING an essential oil so bad like I wanted my pillow to smell like  eucalyptus
4728 2018-07-31 14:20:21 Lack of wage growth equals a lack of consumer spending. Political uncertainty makes consumers anxious. Oil prices suck money away from consumers.
4729 2018-07-31 14:20:18 yep....but problem is this very process drains GCC of its wealth...it is an ingenious way of sucking all equity and saved wealth out;.it is plunder via war.guns 2heads of rulers help assure oil/gas wealth continues 2flow exclusively 2 empire or else.

4732 2018-07-31 14:20:14 What’s more likely (and actually happening) is that Russian $ is being funnelled into third party organizations (mainly those that oppose Canada’s oil sector, oddly enough). Russia is hardly a fan of the Conservative Party. Harper was a thorn in his side and Scheer still banned.

4752 2018-07-31 14:16:47 Do you know why counters have wars? Because there is not enough oil. It is silly to start war over something like that. Wars are usually pretty BAD enisent kids or people die. All because the president or King have different opinions. Or they get personal. So war. I say no war.
4753 2018-07-31 14:16:41 My question is, if Trump isn't shut down now, will #PutinsRogueState become too powerful to control?

4759 2018-07-31 14:16:14 1. Rancid oil may be a problem.
2. Omega 3/6 ratio may  be the issue,fish oil may be irrelevant unless subjects also make an effort to curtail omega 6 consumption.
4760 2018-07-31 14:16:09 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however open borders.
4761 2018-07-31 14:16:08 Get what you can for the gold you have. Maybe you can have some uncertainty and others to boost the price. Then look over at your dollar value and discuss interest rate. Never mentioned that the dollar spiked when oil dropped did you. Welcome to trend, you fool only the ignorant.

4770 2018-07-31 14:15:28 Amazing under ACA that healthy middle class paid more to support unhealthy people that live unhealthy lifestyles and low income premiums  was paid by taxpayers. Free rides come and go. Obama care was healthcare snake oil.
4771 2018-07-31 14:15:26 Surely the US fiscal deficit contributes to oil and timber demand.

Canada is free-riding again -- just like on drugs and defense!

4781 2018-07-31 14:14:29 $BTE earnings were disappointing. Hedging has just killed them. Not sure how they're able to advertise "$55 oil is our breakeven" when they're posting losses at $67 oil. Long term story is unchanged. Derivatives contracts will expire. But disappointing in short term. $RRX
4782 2018-07-31 14:14:26 What other programs? This is the one that is wasteful and so it may be pointed out as being a poor use of taxpayer $$. Are you referring to the billions going to @OilGasCanada for innovation? Why are we paying for this cost for oil industry? Don't they make enough $$? @jkenney

4796 2018-07-31 14:13:13 Might also be because of the CBD oil for similar reasons. CBD has been known to slow test production which in turn would slow conversion to DHT
4797 2018-07-31 14:13:00 I use lots of sugar (brown if you have it) and Oil or petroleum jelly, if the oil is too liquidy.
4798 2018-07-31 14:12:54 There has to be an opening here for an enterprising engineering company to manufacture and sell plugless sumps for race bikes. Syphon the oil out when it needs changing.

4801 2018-07-31 14:12:35 @qubadjt  why cant yall form a real government with rules and laws like the US instead of being broken down groups that never agree with anything and do nothing but steal oil money. I live in the US and Im kurdish. Very sad!
4802 2018-07-31 14:12:14 How is it silly? Can you tell me what income oil now brings in? Come on, you are the one dismissing what I said. Surely you have a detailed answer - with numbers? Does oil now bring in the £8 billion a year Eck promised in 2014? You must surely know the answer.

4810 2018-07-31 14:11:44 Also, trains always justify the investment. The increase to GDP from simply connecting cities across the province AND country would do wonders for the economy - let alone the transport of oil which would counter any need for pipelines. But no, I'm sure biking is better....
4811 2018-07-31 14:11:44 Awesome!!! Banks issues nearly done...only High oil prices are the only hurdle!! That's it!!!!!

4862 2018-07-31 14:07:01 I personally do not think Islam is a problem at all. The only problem Islamic countries have is the fact that they are sitting on top of large oil deposits. Oil that Israel, the USA , the EU , Russia , and China would like to get their hands on.

4865 2018-07-31 14:06:30 All because of negligence and so focused on oil.
4866 2018-07-31 14:06:29 No. It’s because we’re sitting on barrels and barrels of oil. Look at OK and KS - havens for repub leadership. KS is bankrupt and OK is so poor they only have school 3 days a week. Federally, repubs just added 1 TRILLION to debt. That’s what republican leadership will get you.

4873 2018-07-31 14:05:46 Not 100% sure about the quantity of each oil (Because I was experimenting), but the amount is roughly in the descending order in each list- black castor oil, coconut oil and rosemary oil made up a large amount of the concoction!

4875 2018-07-31 14:05:36 Many technologies/ways of producing cheap energy have not been allowed to be developed due to globalist's insistence on our continued dependency to oil and nuclear energy. Both expensive, and environmentally destructive. Globalism has been proven to fail+EU depends on globalism.
4876 2018-07-31 14:05:31 More advocation for the run up to regime change.

The article doesn’t mention why and which state and entities artificially drove down the oil prices in 2014; and this important omission causes the piece to lose credibility. Inform the reader, not propagandize.

4897 2018-07-31 14:02:00 I just find it interesting that Venezuela was doing quite well with its command economy of exporting oil, up until the price of oil dropped significantly and never recovered. But I guess this is just a case of correlation not causation

4899 2018-07-31 14:01:44 Right around here, call it $1300, the gold price neither favors debtors or creditors in the economy and doesn’t need to go higher. Oil would trade $85-90, which is a bit higher but not crazy. The benefits of a peg would overwhelm any problems associated with higher oil.

4914 2018-07-31 13:59:36 @ZECzim really know how to test our patience. We are generally a peace loving people but even for the second Chimurenga, there was the match that lit the oil soaked rag. Nearly 24hrs since close of polling and not a single result released.
4915 2018-07-31 13:59:33 It was an evil war. As are the "wars" we are fighting in the middle east. In the 50's
and 60's it was the communist domino theory.  Now it is economics. OIL. The ME is tribal and will fight amongst themselves forever. It is their revolution, their civil war. Let THEM fight it.

4926 2018-07-31 13:58:55 As if you know what its like to struggle, coming from a well to do family living in a upscale suburb and going to the best schools. Take your snake oil and sell it somewhere else.

4938 2018-07-31 13:57:32 The treatment has extended to journalists. Jones Abiri, based in the southern city of Yenagoa, was arrested by secret police in July 2016, accused of involvement in the sabotage of crude oil pipelines by militants in the Niger River delta.

4942 2018-07-31 13:57:10 Which simply goes to prove that the benefits of lowered GST were used by manufacturers to increase their % figures. But middle class will keep struggling. Refinery production going up means high fuel price benefits are being harvested by Oil marketing companies.

4954 2018-07-31 13:56:20 $ASKE an oil stock, keeps chipping away, can't wait for this one to go. Need news.
4955 2018-07-31 13:56:18 Actually capitalism has been the cause of a lot of violence; just look back to how factory owners hired goons to intimidate and murder union leaders and organizers, or how W Bush had the US invade Iraq for access to oil... I can keep going but maybe, uhh, study some history dude.
4956 2018-07-31 13:56:18 Is that the same guy who was an mi5 asset,who’s family were trained to fight against gadaffi so we could wreck his country,steal their oil and gold then leave their country in the state it is in now?

4963 2018-07-31 13:55:34 Obviously we are going to be affected by the new mortgage rules which makes it tougher for first time buyers causing a housing sales slowdown. Also tariffs are going to hit us but price of oil is continuing to rise, which our economy heavily relies on.

4970 2018-07-31 13:55:15 1970/74 mines in Scotland fell by a third, steel production plunged a fifth. Shipbuilding was in trouble after Tory PM Heath refused to bail out 4 Clyde yards. Unions staged work-ins & occupied yards. 70K people marched. ALL WHILE HEATH WAS KEEPING THE VAST SCOT OIL WEALTH SECRET
4971 2018-07-31 13:55:15 I guess industry & FERC feel that not enough homes have blown up, not enough waterways are contaminated, gas leaks, oil spills are a non issue, etc. in order to make changes. 
Pipelines are often under waterways, when they leak they say it's too difficult to fix.
Don't build it!

EU companies wouldn't import UK components, food etc, EU firms would leave the UK and we'd have to go back to a 1960s diet: no year round tomatoes, peppers, lettuce, strawberries etc & less foreign cheese, olive oil etc.

5008 2018-07-31 13:52:35 WHAT?! Are your tastebuds ok??? The fries and mac n cheese were pretty good but the chicken burgers tasted like oil and expired milk
5009 2018-07-31 13:52:31 Where does olive oil come from?
--a stranger right outside the macaroni grill in O’Hare
5010 2018-07-31 13:52:28 Remain bearish crude oil, despite yesterday up turn..
5011 2018-07-31 13:52:26 Now that's the psychological reasons why people took their money and ran to DT's open arms. The root of the 2016 lack of growth also had mostly to do with oil falling from I believe $115 to around $30 a barrel in less than a 2 year time period. That'll cause some tumult for sure.
5012 2018-07-31 13:52:25 The natural flavors that are a part of the ingredient list which usually contains beef, doesn’t have any animal product. But they can’t say it’s 100% vegan because of the cross contamination possibility. We fry non vegan items in the same oil that we fry the French fries.

5021 2018-07-31 13:51:01 The redevelopment will start within the next 3-6 month, if you want to talk about something not getting of the ground you should look at the forever taking oil exploration deal. 8 years now!
5022 2018-07-31 13:50:58 It’s like I have espn or something. I can tell the weather by the consistency of my coconut oil
5023 2018-07-31 13:50:58 Yea keep up that bio oil for sure babe! Especially with any of the risen ones. And fingers crossed in a couple years technology will have advanced enough to remove them easier 
5024 2018-07-31 13:50:55 The main reason for #Bolivar's inflation is the collapse of oil prices.

I agree that the mistakes of the #Chavez / #Maduro administration (namely price controls) included socialist practices.

However, it is not a problem of socialism, but rather of #populism.

5038 2018-07-31 13:49:16 No of course not, I meant _our_ predation on sharks. People catching sharks &killing them for commercial purposes. I have seen shark liver oil as an ingredient in certain OTC products. There is also the demand for shark fins for soup. It was that issue to which I referred.
5039 2018-07-31 13:49:05 Bon à matin c'est une alarme de l'autre génératrice  oil level pressure.
5040 2018-07-31 13:49:00 Oil companies spend shitloads of money just searching for oil. Then the mfs gotta drill into the Earth to extract it, ignoring all the environmental damage they’re causing with fracking and water contamination.
5041 2018-07-31 13:48:34 "Oil companies realised N Sea drilling was cost-effective & lucrative. The UK  gov realised it was a gold mine, Scot Nats claimed: "It's Scotland's Oil" in 1972. If only they saw McCrone's report. Indy Scotland's budget surplus, he said, would be so large as to be  "embarrassing"

Fracking will destroy our natural underground water reservoirs and they can't be revived. Clean energy isn't just AN option, it's the only option. And your account is fake AF!

5086 2018-07-31 13:42:40 Its all about the oil.
5087 2018-07-31 13:42:38 Mainly biomass energy. Switch to biomass that grows in a little as 4 months with 50,000+ uses that range from food and textiles to biofuels..

Biomass gives back seeds while oil and oil-dependent energy sources give back death(war) and debt.

5125 2018-07-31 13:39:19 In 2017, the United Kingdom imported approximately 47 million metric tons of crude oil and natural gas, and exported approximately 37 million metric tons of the same. The import from Saudi Arabia was 1.6 million tons.

5140 2018-07-31 13:36:41 There is glut in the oil market so some of the oil producers must be kept out of the market. The rest of the oil producers gang up to do so.  When Trump imposes sanctions on Iran he tries to rope in Russia on his side to isolate Iran. Good politics!

มีช่วงหนึ่งเราทำงานเลิกมาถึงบ้านอาบน้ำนอนเลย แทบทุกวัน 
จนเขาถามทำไมพี่ทำแบบนั่นละ 
นี่บอกฉันเหนื่อย (สั้นๆ)
แต่เด็กมันจำเว่ย นางทำงานได้ปีกว่าแล้วทักมา "เจ้หนูรู้หนูเข้าใจแล้วที่เจ้บอกเหนื่อยถึงบ้านละนอนเลย"

5185 2018-07-31 13:31:34 So the risk of flooding that comes from overpopulation and overbuilding is the fault of the oil companies?  Get real. Let’s have some facts and not just a money grab.

5230 2018-07-31 13:25:20 It’s not possible, the least they could sell it for is R10 - R11 per liter, purely on oil price and exchange rate. Unless they get a subsidy of over 50% and are paying no fuel taxes

5288 2018-07-31 13:18:32 Growth slowed in EMs, which cut demand for commodities, including oil. At the same time, US oil production was accelerating due to technology improvements. The combination of oversupply and falling demand, led to an energy sector “recession,” which spilled over into other sectors

5329 2018-07-31 13:13:30 Economics & EFF is like water and oil. This communication sounds more like a personal attack rather than using “superior logic” to argue against corporate tax reduction.

5346 2018-07-31 13:11:41 That’s perfect! I personally like to make sugar scrubs for use but the gloves are clutch. Exfoliate in the shower. Use the gloves and apply the oil. Use up and down motions vs circular.  The oil helps. You can use a little tea tree on that outer area too.

5441 2018-07-31 12:59:41 I use the Mediterranean trio....olive oil , garlic and lemon juice  , salt & pepper .

5443 2018-07-31 12:59:30 Employment in AB probably varies with the international price of oil more than government policies. High unemployment figures of 2009/10 were with Cons both prov and fed. Oil drops, unemployment follows. Slower to recover rach time than the price of oil is.

5458 2018-07-31 12:57:45 Cannabis has only directly killed one person; someone who drank 100% pure cannabis oil. It doesnt just give you schizophrenia, mental illnesses like that lay dormant and can potentially be brought out by the drug. Cannabis in itself does less damage to you than alcohol or smoking

5463 2018-07-31 12:57:28 Everyone's plan for global dominance (hegemony) relies on pipelines for gas/oil/water to Asia. It's why Russian dug in in Afghanistan and then we did. Putin finally found a chump in the WH to help them/hurt us. After Helsinki, no coincidence that Trump's moving on Afghanistan.
5464 2018-07-31 12:57:26 castor oil and vaseline. put a mixture of that in any container and then get a clean spoolie brush (you can get a lot from sephora testers) and put a nice thick coat on your lashes before bed  every night for a month+. <333

5524 2018-07-31 12:50:14 "Dare" That word is in itself a confession. "Israel" lobby (I think you mean AIPAC, not J Street, JVP or IfNotNow, right?) is powerful... as long as its interests corresponds to those of US. Otherwise, other lobbies has much more money for 'influence', e.g. the oil lobby.

5586 2018-07-31 12:41:21 Water? Not a drop of water is transferred from Scotland to England.
Energy? All those wind farms only exist because of subsidies. Why would England want to subsidise Scottish wind when it can subsidise it’s own, especially the off shore growth.
Oil? We will see what happens
5587 2018-07-31 12:41:21 @GOP $3.00 gas prices or higher is a sure way NOT to get re-elected in your state? Get them down! Use your power! YOU already give these oil companies subsidies? Why should they have prices this high? THINK for a change..

5608 2018-07-31 12:39:14 Without debating the merits of such a peg, any such peg would have to be at a much higher gold price to work; if gold remained priced in oil at 15 barrels/oz, such a pegged system would drive massive inflation in oil prices that would hurt rather than help the global economy.

5622 2018-07-31 12:36:24 After the latest downturn there was really only one way to go. Up! That the NDP happened to be in government lurching around like a one legged bull, and did not deter that growth is testament to the strength of the oil and gas business in Alberta.
5623 2018-07-31 12:36:21 trump & co and the raping of America ‘cause tax cuts don’t generate enough 1% $$ so - he’s gutted EPA safe guards, lifted protracted status from many animal species, allowed hunting bear cubs during hibernation, commercializing nat’l parks, test fed land for oil, etc.
5624 2018-07-31 12:36:13 Canada May GDP at 0.5% m/m; beats 0.3% estimate as non- conventional oil production picks up with a 5.3% m/m increase following april shutdowns #cdnecon

5627 2018-07-31 12:36:07 City have an oil rich government paying all the bills. That pretty much ends all the arguments. What most people don't understand is that City, and PSG, and to a lesser extent Chelsea can simply pick aup the phone and get the player they need, no matter the cost.

5633 2018-07-31 12:35:21 That depends.  If Scotland joins EU then it must be treated as any other EU country.  That said, if no deal then it has so mismanaged Scotland infrastructure, that we have no ports to get our trade direct to EU.

Equally, Scotland can play hardball with water, energy, oil, food!

5723 2018-07-31 12:21:59 Whether there may be a clear limit on how much oil you can get from a reservoir, the upper limit of how much economic value you can produce with it is much more fuzzy and maleable. 

'Carrying capacity' mixes both limits and, imo, the article does not disentangle them.

5749 2018-07-31 12:17:48 100% true, I have cleaned my workstation, swapped out utensils and pans, and still told them I can't guarantee but will do my best. I didn't want people dying in my place of work cause I used sesame oil instead of canola.

5756 2018-07-31 12:16:28 Boj ecb... Currencies are trying to find their value as the world translates and extrapolates central bank policy on future inflation expectations. Oil still is a supply demand vehicle, limited by capacity. They don't have to be perfectly correlated imo
5757 2018-07-31 12:16:06 @SecretaryPerry . Hi Mr. PERRY. Just to let you know you are doing a wonderful job, I think by exporting oil to Europe  they will not depend on Russia also it will create jobs in USA.
5758 2018-07-31 12:15:57 We got a real orange clown in the White House and his reality show has to end! Snake oil salesman!

5760 2018-07-31 12:15:30 Yep. Confirmed with the specialist yesterday. I’d only introduced CBD oil recently but was told to discontinue it yesterday. Not sure what the situation is if you aren’t on Orkambi 
5761 2018-07-31 12:15:28 this is strange, and probably a smoke screen, both pro fossil and oil, any argument only seeks to distract from Russian collusion and the "investigation"

5770 2018-07-31 12:14:20 Do you know the ban on selling oil by big countries on iran etc removed in 2015 ?

Do you know before that iran and other country selling oil to india charged 50% transportation only at that time because that time they have limits to sell .
5771 2018-07-31 12:14:17 oh fuck i ended up at a brand new "good things aren't possible" take i had never seen before, "the DAPL pipeline is okay because train cars delivering oil would be worse"

5775 2018-07-31 12:13:43 This article reminds me of the old discussion about oil reserves. Whether they are fixed or they grow as technological change turns them profitable.

Ultimately, it is a confusion between how the economy and how nature works. Human ingenuity may know no limits, but ecosystems do.

Get a little Oil of Oregano liquid at like a GNC and put 4 or 5 drops under your tongue and about 4 drops in a sip of water and you won’t need any antacid anymore or even something like prescription Nexium anymore.

5812 2018-07-31 12:08:17 As for my pumpkin soup, it wasn't even pumpkin, honestly. It was just water and vegetable oil and pepper and salt, and my god it was gnarly. It tasted like baby vomit

5822 2018-07-31 12:05:56 To get the pasta taste, you have to cover/marinate the “noodles” in olive oil, salt/pepper, parmesan, and a hint of almond flour for about 45 mins before you cook them. Then you cook ALL the other ingredients first and basically let the heat off of that finish cooking the noodles

5848 2018-07-31 12:02:19 You may not be able to get a RoI supplier of oil, but the border isn't an issue for fuel movement.
5849 2018-07-31 12:02:16 Even that requires believing that the usual suspects of corporate conspiracy - the oil companies, agribusiness and so on - were outmanoeuvred by a handful of hedge funds. I honestly think it's more plausible and scarier that Brexiteers simply believe what they're saying.

5865 2018-07-31 11:59:42 You ask international oil companies to employ our graduates, when they are called for interview, they fail basic standard tests used worldwide.

5944 2018-07-31 11:49:12 And the reason why they depend on oil is because the government decided to seize almost every mean of production, rendering it useless, and unproductive by subsidizing its production losses with oil money, avoiding saving any money at all.

6119 2018-07-31 11:21:09 The markets will track global cues esp. trade tariff war and geo-political unrest from Middle East. Apart from this, quarterly earnings, crude oil prices, and currency trend would be the factors driving the market.

6123 2018-07-31 11:20:06 Fact is that #Amerca (including u) runs on oil. We would all love 2 have a cost effective, reliable, ecofriendly alternative but until it happens, we must utilize oil.

6125 2018-07-31 11:19:48 I’ll never pay for an oil change, or to have brakes and rotors put on again until I’m old AF.

6130 2018-07-31 11:19:01 Haha! Sadly, too many pieces. Have to hope I see them at an event soon. Usually buy some za’atar, cumin oil and a piece of their gorgeous pottery (although, had reached my limit.)
6131 2018-07-31 11:18:45 This is the covert racist and bigoted agenda of @Greenpeace and Hudema.  They are indirectly funded by big USA oil and Gazprom.

6139 2018-07-31 11:17:58 Thanks for the response Mike. Have to admit, that's caught me out. As you say GBP not showing any sudden weakness, and not really a big move in oil. Think I'll sit it out.

6143 2018-07-31 11:17:50 1) TAN is mostly a problem where it comes out in the system. Refineries already take that risk and run crudes and crude blends that their system can handle.
2) RHDS or other sulphur removal systems are not particularly good at removing sulphur from fuel oil/residue.

6159 2018-07-31 11:14:40 Fair go, John Howard knows about unjust & unfair. John was PM while Australia was bugging East Timorese officials to gain unjust & unfair advantage in Timorese oil/gas negotiations
6160 2018-07-31 11:14:32 The #Koch brothers always seem 2 years behind the times. @DNC kept them from their pipeline while #WarrenBuffett’s train dutifully carried the oil at 10xs the cost & more pollution (@DNC hypocrisy). Now they switch to the losers.
6161 2018-07-31 11:14:23 Precisely. It’s incredibly ridiculous for the everyday person. But it’s still an infringement .
6162 2018-07-31 11:14:01 I mean we don’t import oil so it’s ours but it’s still slightly more expensive than before. A full Nissan petrol used to cause 180 dhs. Now it’s 240.
6163 2018-07-31 11:13:56 To match oil and gas? No.
6164 2018-07-31 11:13:41 Definitely somewhere i'd like to go, just seems like they're flooded with oil money and don't have a clue what to do with it.
6165 2018-07-31 11:13:40 Not oil. Not GBP. Looks more like general strength, extension of recent momentum, quite a few making upside tests/breakouts or bouncing
6166 2018-07-31 11:13:35 I wonder if this is due to the rise of the US as a major oil producer...
6167 2018-07-31 11:13:31 Few months ago started taking Magnesium, zinc, multi vit, cod liver oil, calcium supplements every morning. 7 tablets and I’m fit as a fiddle and very rarely ill. Even my hay fever has been negligible this summer (when it should have been horrendous) compared to previous years.
6168 2018-07-31 11:13:12 if they can raise that from about 3000 members we could run Scotland with a weekly tombola,5 million people taking part should raise billions who needs oil

6175 2018-07-31 11:11:08 In the past in the Med that would be dry pulses, evaporated milk, cans of meat and ham, sugar and oil in bulk, coffee, long life orange juice and toilet paper! But then again there was an actual threat of war or a coup d’etat. Don’t know how Brexit is going to be classed !
6176 2018-07-31 11:11:04 No doubt coal is more polluting than say panels but incremental innovation is important. Engineers are burning midnight oil to reduce pollution impact (clean coal). I don't understand the hate coal fired plants get when there are no economically feasible alternatives yet.

6210 2018-07-31 11:06:01 Ah.. ok so Africa is broad but isn't it wise for us to invest in smaller developing countries like the Congo or Rwanda that need our humanitarian aid as well as being the top producers of oil and renewable energy to the world?
6211 2018-07-31 11:05:57 Every chef on tv ever: “Just add a tablespoon of oil” 

Bitch you just poured half a liter
6212 2018-07-31 11:05:53 It isn’t the *price* of oil that is the issue. It is tax revenue, which is practically zero because Swinney begged Osborne to slash tax on oil companies, and Osborne obliged. You want to risk a junk rating? Yes, separatists like a gamble. Eck bet the farm on a false prospectus.
6213 2018-07-31 11:05:49 They stole oil revenue from Native Americans.

6216 2018-07-31 11:05:13 Two cents, 1) med/hvy crudes may not have good TAN, 2) h2 cost btw running light sw and med/hvy sour. A RHDS adds $4 bbl capital cost. h2, at $8/mmbtu, adds $2.0+/bbl. cost will go up if crude gets higher due to IMO, via oil link unless it is in the US.
6217 2018-07-31 11:04:22 @hyejoosonkr olip oil !
6218 2018-07-31 11:04:16 Oil embargo saved the Japanese brands, they were on their last legs in the US.  Gasoline prices shot up and inflation surged.  We went off the gold standard.  Lots of factors but the beginning of the end with the trade deficits.
6219 2018-07-31 11:03:52 I either use a neutrogena exfoliating scrub or I make my own scrub with brown sugar, honey and a bit of coconut oil.

6225 2018-07-31 11:03:06 They tried to cover it up of course. One potential theory is that if the corporate corporate owned media covered it more it would have “upset” trump’s oil buddies. Then the trump administration would have blocked access to the WH from the press, so they caved.
6226 2018-07-31 11:02:58 I tried it today! Was told to use ACV first for transition. In fair, mabula naman when used under the shower pero madali mawala the bubbles. At least it satisfied my need for bula. Haha! So far, okay naman my hair. I used Moroccan Argan oil tho, kase no conditioner.
6227 2018-07-31 11:02:50 My skin was rough as a badger yday.. used honey & olive oil to exfoliate last night & woke up smooth af. Literally just crystallised honey mixed with olive oil.

@realDonaldTrump they won't be fooled again!
6231 2018-07-31 11:02:42 If by "it" you mean how to lie and con and sell bad quality snake oil to a mass of cult-like followers who have absolutely no critical thinking skills then I'm 100% behind you, dude!
6232 2018-07-31 11:02:23 A very good point, there. It took Hitler, what, some 8-10 years to spread enough oil on the political waters in Germany for society to be willing to fully embrace him. Meanwhile, his supporters did the grassroots job needed.
6233 2018-07-31 11:02:23 1. You said "would" re Colin Ellis's comments in the Times. He said "could" so you've distorted what he said.. all predicated on an oil price that is now 60% higher today. If anyone has maligned him it is you by distorting what he actually said.
6234 2018-07-31 11:02:14 Just buy a 3D printer, print a 3D printer, then return the one you bought.  Problem solved.
6235 2018-07-31 11:02:09 My favorite one is Oh Beehive by TIGI or Perk Up by Amika!! Neither of them leave a nasty feeling it’s awesome. I’ve gone like 4-5 days without shampooing & used them & they suck up the oil like no other
6236 2018-07-31 11:02:09 Can you stop given us excuses. We are tired of hearing your excuses. Do you think the man of the road care about Oil revenue. People are dying in various states in Nigeria and what you can tweet about is oil revenue.

6253 2018-07-31 10:59:54 Thank you for posting that.  My father had a childhood friend who became a doctor, graduated before WWII and served as a flight surgeon.  He believed in B12 shots, cod liver oil and eating liver.  He was holisitic in the 1950's and 60's.
6254 2018-07-31 10:59:46 America and Russia are doing what the European powers of Britain and France did...soon China and India would do the same as US and Russia become self sufficient in oil production..

6259 2018-07-31 10:58:52 I have a pretty fair clue about the negativity towards nuclear expressed in your media, but I also believe a large portion of that slant was purchased by advertisers who wanted to sell more coal, oil, natural gas, wind turbines, solar panels and gas turbines.

6272 2018-07-31 10:56:42 Oil is likely overpriced, in the short-term at least. So, I expect Brent/WTI to fall through Autumn. Those currencies will also fall, but less in relative terms and the gap will narrow but not close. My 2-cents.

6279 2018-07-31 10:55:43 It’s “humorous” that government farm subsidies and oil subsidies are somehow not socialism but public school lunch programs and single payer health care are somehow socialist. It’s almost like there are two sets of rules.

6395 2018-07-31 10:31:41 Even by the evidence you try to present, the article blames dwindling oil revenues for lack of funds to release for capital projects. You’re making it look like the last administration abandoned it for a lack of concern. Do your thing though. Nigerians will decide ultimately.
6396 2018-07-31 10:31:31 Big oil says alot of things that are not true. We cannot “adapt” our way out of anything. Earth is being destroyed at a faster pace than previously thought. We are in serious trouble.

6526 2018-07-31 10:04:31 Ai que tem vários estudos que mostram que o cleansing oil é ótimo e remove 99% da sujeira sem agredir a barreira hidrolipidica da pele, sendo isso muito melhor que demaquilantes simples ou bifásicos...
6527 2018-07-31 10:04:19 Nigeria has lost over 1billion litres of oil since January 2018 due to linkage.

6534 2018-07-31 10:03:27 Oil producing states,give them ranches. Cattle producing states,give them refineries. State elections send 3000 officers. State with high level killings, send 1000 officers. Peaceful IPOB send killer pythons and deadly Fulani herdsmen pray for them. #Buharimostgo
6535 2018-07-31 10:02:58 Judaism is a re-hash of Egyptian and some Babylonian traditions and fables. These were in turn  adapted by Christianity and Islam for their own purposes. Each Genesis corresponds to a shift in political power. God and the prophets are either politicians or snake oil salesmen.
6536 2018-07-31 10:02:45 The opposite view would hold the Koch brothers should stick to the oil business and stay out of politics too.  n'est pas?

Ingested 60g of #cannabis oil over 3 months and according to the Royal Marsden I have been cancer free for 4 years. So not just mice cannabis works on

6544 2018-07-31 10:01:25 You should treat crude oil and condensate as a separate stream. It has different market dynamics, and will reach peak in the medium term because poor nations and the poor in richer nations won't be able to afford the ever increasing prices.

6554 2018-07-31 09:59:27 The fans have eyes too. Sure the media puts oil on the fire, but Mourinho created the fire and it's big enough to be seen by Man Utd fans.

6559 2018-07-31 09:58:05 Nuts? No, but at least I'm not a sucker. Blaming the gov't for loss of foreign investment is simply naive. Low oil prices and NAFTA fears (all caused externally) are to blame. It even preceded the present gov't - which of course, you won't hear from the right wing propagandists.
6560 2018-07-31 09:58:04 TThere are some uncertainties. That's for granted. However, was it difficult for Indigo to hedge their fuel and forex? Their results seemed fine when the oil prices and Re were low.
6561 2018-07-31 09:57:49 Not enough. USA is bombing only oil countries.

6571 2018-07-31 09:56:36 I'd say the biggest problem is just personal incompetence and going to fast and not saving any of the vast oil wealth spent to vastly improve the lives of most people for a problem like an oil price crash that's out of their control

6639 2018-07-31 09:45:43 I don't see that at all.  The "current" strength is in oil/gas but this isn't the future renewables are. Tourism, food will tick along (where's that dairy?) and life sciences won't shift up a gear without major investment which never seems to be forthcoming,  1/2

6747 2018-07-31 09:27:46 Oil will well surpass that.

When the industry shrinks, cost cuts and consolidates its G&A to the point that it has, there are HUGE profits to be made on a good upturn.  That good upturn will come and it will surpass the $120 mark.

I should make this a goal of mine to get any quality Bob Ross style painting done by the end of the year, also seemed easier playing with oil paints how he did.
6802 2018-07-31 09:18:48 Looking ahead, shale is unlikely to sustainably grow enough to quench the world’s raging thirst for oil. Three years of lower oil prices have boosted demand, and the vaunted energy transition from oil to electric vehicles will arrive much later than advertised.
6803 2018-07-31 09:18:35 What is a South Melbourne Dim Sim? Does it spit “Hellas” at you as put it in hot oil?
6804 2018-07-31 09:18:25 -dark circles 
massage a small amount of almond oil or coffee around your eyes using your ring finger to treat the dark circles; stay consistent for good results!!!!

6806 2018-07-31 09:18:18 So did she agree to give back their oil or are we still being shits to the Timorese
6807 2018-07-31 09:18:08 Should we leave the oil in the soil and the coal in the hole? @NnimmoB @Yadomah @joyce_okeoghene #LifeAfterOil #SchoolOfEcology
6808 2018-07-31 09:17:53 During the Thatcher Era, the UK had Scottish Oil Just coming on to maximum output without new wells (which would increase the loot) why then did she engage in a Public Asset sell -off other than to enrich her supporters and friends?
UK didn’t need the money, it needed its assets!
6809 2018-07-31 09:17:51 It will only get worse with fuel taxes impacting all goods and services that move. And then power prices will rise with the pressure on energy supply from Labours dumb ass ban on oil and gas industry

6811 2018-07-31 09:17:46 It is not just a narrative he borrowed more. And the oil price since 2017 has increased from 38$ to 87$ there about.
6812 2018-07-31 09:17:45 But each time he comes to my place he uses my oil .
6813 2018-07-31 09:17:44 slow-roasting eggplant in my cast iron pot like a sauna of olive oil; cycling home in a northerly headwind and not stopping (this one's not an advisable part of my personality); the busted drainpipe outside the bathroom bringing the camellia into early blossom.
6814 2018-07-31 09:17:44 Cut up into fries, sprinkle with olive oil, salt, rosemary and cinnamon and put in the oven.
6815 2018-07-31 09:17:26 Ok.... but if he lowered the price the where everyone could afford it.... he would make even more money. John d rockellor became the richest man in history not by raising the Price of oil but By lowering it so everyone could afford it.

6818 2018-07-31 09:16:31 yep thats the exact range for oil until a war comes ... i respect your views on dax very good work ..what i meant is cpi accelerated due to oil factor

6824 2018-07-31 09:15:19 Of course it is, and the way theleft try and ignore further ignites. The initial jump was the oil on the floor and the ignorance by the left is the match.
6825 2018-07-31 09:15:11 I don't know much about painting admittedly. From what I hear acrylics dry very quickly, and apparently there are different brushes for different types of paints (acrylic, oil, etc.)
6826 2018-07-31 09:15:07 Bob Mills lucky to get ears done so quick, won't touch them at our surgery unless you put olive oil in for at least 14 days before 
6827 2018-07-31 09:14:50 Is it true that the ONGC officer who reported the theft & illegal exploration in ONGC oil fields of Kaveri basin by Reliance in 2011 is presently retired but deprived of pension ?

6830 2018-07-31 09:13:48 They do so many 180s im surprised they haven't drilled themselves into the ground far enough to strike oil. At least then they'd be busy for a while protesting themselves on environmental grounds. Maybe Ocasio Cortez will come by and take economic advantage of it like Benezuela?
6831 2018-07-31 09:13:44 I beg to differ.  There would be nothing stopping the Government establishing a national oil company that feeds profits back into the government and itself and competes for oil and gas licenses like the others in the NS.  Eventually, over time it could be a "Statoil"
6832 2018-07-31 09:13:34 It seems like most Nigerian food vendors on social media are in a silent competition to see who puts more oil in their food.

6834 2018-07-31 09:12:13 very excited seeing retail sentiment if you saw my previous tweet! As for oil don't worry every time it creeps above 71-72 we have Trump speaking it down! Trades 64-74 over the summer!

"animals on the canola oil-enriched diet weighed significantly more than mice on the regular diet"

there you go. this is not a good study. one has to substitute canola oil CALORIES in the regular diet. then you have something.
6838 2018-07-31 09:11:45 OIL works. Unreliables do not. Simple sense and economics.
6839 2018-07-31 09:11:30 A dear friend just sent me this quote. I LOVE IT!!
"Live like the roar in the cave of the lion's throat. 
Live like the mustard seed that is dropped into hot oil -- ready to explode its flavor into everything. 
Like the wick in a candle. Flickering. Fierce. Alive."
6840 2018-07-31 09:11:27 I feel that Scotland should invest heavily in air defences and special forces once independent if she wishes to use her oil to benefit her people and not hedge fund gangsters.

6854 2018-07-31 09:09:42 I love the countryside. I don't campaign against fracking, but I do for local green spaces. I'm against oil consumption in general. Sold my car despite having enough wealth. I run, cycle, or take public transport.
6855 2018-07-31 09:09:37 I've watched enough Gordon Ramsey to know that 1tbsp olive oil = 1ltr olive oil. It's a chef thing that I don't claim to understand, I just live by it.

6872 2018-07-31 09:05:54 Denmark is in general self-sufficient with oil. Market prices dictate production and there is a strong political aspiration to move away from coal and oil dependency to renewable energy. Responsible Liberal socialism that plans for the future.
6873 2018-07-31 09:05:48 I normally bake my own but have had hand in cast for most of the year. I tried to buy decent store bought bread but so far have been unacceptable. Local bakeries make wholemeal bread that's white on inside. A wholegrain bread I bought at Woollies had palm oil!

An olive oil spray pin would be so iconic
6880 2018-07-31 09:05:10 Zionism wasn't taken seriously by white Christian nations until WWI, then circulated the German conflation of socialism and Judaism, as well as the necessity of oil. Only then were Britain and France interested in financing Zionism and maintaining a Jewish nation in West Asia.
6881 2018-07-31 09:05:06 No time for the idea that this is a non-story. This stuff isn't widely known about and needs light shed on it. Plus it's ludicrous that they have charitable status while being funded by oil, tobacco and gambling firms to further their interests.

6929 2018-07-31 08:53:25 Cynism against realism in the fight for oil production in Guyana @AJStream. A lesson for us in our #quest for effective sectoral governance in prospective resource utilization to counter the #dutchdisease.
6930 2018-07-31 08:53:25 You literally asked the gas station where they buy their oil in bulk from
6931 2018-07-31 08:52:58 I think it's politically motivated.. due to issue with ERCL. Even palm oil industry here are affected when China decided to buy from Indonesia instead.

Ministry of Health didn't say anything about durian so far..

Effortlessly
Fingers tracing the lines
Where the clothes ends
And only skin remains

The skin that was kissed by the sun first
Then
By those hungry lips

7133 2018-07-31 08:11:32 Plus oil is a more of a supply story anyway (ie. Sanctions on Iran oil exports, declining Venezuelan production. depletion of existing reservoirs, major underinvestment in the 14-16 period, problems in Libya and so on).

7146 2018-07-31 08:09:36 Eventually yes...But it does not seem it is happening at the moment. The US just surpassed its all time high monthly demand for oil this summer. Oil prices will have to rise much higher to cause demand destruction.

7223 2018-07-31 07:51:49 Yeah but will the oil/petrol lobby allow that that's the problem with it the ppl with the money have too much sway on decisions and all capitalism relies on is people acting in everyone's best intentions which they rarley do when money is involved.

I drink my elbows
Into a vat of cold
Dark oil
Splash my face

Scrape my knuckles
So my blood congeals
Just 1 more time
In the dark place
Once was my face
Eyes light up
With a resplendent grin
We can beat this!

7227 2018-07-31 07:51:34 You don’t have to change the oil every 3000 miles as your poll suggests. Oils and lubricants are good enough for 10,000 to 15,000 miles these days.

7250 2018-07-31 07:47:05 Sweden has no oil and gas production. Denmark’s is pretty much finished - hence why Maersk Oil and DONG no longer exists. Denmark has focused on wind power which could only take off with a lot off government grants, paid for by high taxes.....socialism has benefits.

Some also like it on bread.
When cooking with it, you put it in at least 5 minutes before you serve since its already cooked.

7268 2018-07-31 07:42:41 …we need to rethink how our technological appetites are sucking up Africa’s rare earth metals, and in the process exploiting Africans with terrible working conditions and ridiculously low pay for the value of what is being extracted. Same with oil and diamond industries.

7277 2018-07-31 07:41:24 The western countries did not give even a penny to Iraq, Libya or Syria before they attacked them but yes they have looted all their gold and oil.
7278 2018-07-31 07:41:14 Humanity/capitalism has definitely contributed to climate change man. Look at all the waste we produce, how we still use oil even though we have electric cars because the oil lobby is so powerful. The size of the food industry and it's all based on profit not on what is required.

7284 2018-07-31 07:40:15 If large pores are a concern, try an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) product. AHAs remove dead skin cells and hardened oil plugs, making pore appear smaller. Light chemical peels, microdermabrasion, and retinoids can also make pores look smaller.

7299 2018-07-31 07:37:22 ANY Nation that intends replace $s for Gold or something like that in International Trade is a prime target for a USA invasion, so , YEAH, they still would be invaded/destroyed.

Of course that Oil is an extra incentive.
7300 2018-07-31 07:37:21 Thank you Sally. I’m on day 2 today (started early). I can’t breathe!! Stocked up with vitamin b and C and eucalyptus oil xx
7301 2018-07-31 07:37:10 BP reported a sharp increase in Q2 profits as it produced higher Vols. of oil amid improved oil& gas prices. For Q ending 30 June, profit on a an underlying replacement cost basis, the market's preferred measure, rose to $2.79bn from $684m a year earlier quarter last year
7302 2018-07-31 07:36:50 the trick is to avoid destroying the biodiversity of an area, as has happened with "sustainable" palm oil, and i suppose cotton to a degree although this is less documented as it happened before we were paying attention. how does the planey cope with glass?
7303 2018-07-31 07:36:42 Garbage. MbS has to say certain things publicly to stop all you crazies from going nuts & rioting. But the truth is millions of youths throughout the Arab world have no work because there are few functioning economies & the oil will run out soon. What then? Eat sand & drink sun?
7304 2018-07-31 07:36:39 We had the same oil as Norway in case YOU didn't notice they are rich and UK is near bankrupt.

7314 2018-07-31 07:34:19 it would be nice to see how many companies have ever been shut down in the public sector. Banking and oil monopolies are the ONLY places where they make profits. We need more private banks. Icici of course is a psu bank...

7321 2018-07-31 07:32:40 that was the part of Russia unjustly conquered by Pilsudski being gratefully re-absorbed back into the Motherland! That wasn't a war!  Also Russia never sent any oil to Germany and it's all the Americans' fault for not entering the war earlier.
7322 2018-07-31 07:32:29 Never mentioned anything about him being half black and dont care.  He was just a crappy Prez. I banked big paper back when oil was $100 bbl. Rest of country not so much.

7326 2018-07-31 07:31:25 If you cannot afford to have someone change your oil, you might purchase the oil and change it yourself. If you opt to have the service performed, you pay for it. I assure you that you will not have the option of arbitrarily declining to pay for that service.

It's a shame that a highly respected instalation is used to say our oil and gas industry is sub par.
We aren't perfect. But Canada is the most highly regulated country 1)
7337 2018-07-31 07:28:33 We have some robotized plants, but not so much. Our oligarchs prefer sell oil and gas and not to invest in new technologies. When 90% of jobs  are replaced by robots and AI the capitalists will have nobody to pay for their goods and servers.

7357 2018-07-31 07:23:05 That’s pretty cool. And you get even distribution of heat throughout? Might consider getting these as oil baths can get messy and make flasks a pain to clean sometimes.

7365 2018-07-31 07:21:24 Kava and CBD help me a lot. So does fish oil. And a lot of other drugs too. Hit me up if you ever want to talk. I just finished a mixed episode. That pulled my brain apart. The worst of both moods wrapped up into one.
7366 2018-07-31 07:21:18 At least if we leave we’ll have enough fish for fish oil pills to go down in price. I presume that what you’re referring to ?

7464 2018-07-31 07:03:11 Oil price per se has little to do with RIL's prospects since it  works on refining margins, which are mostly stable thru cycles. Jio is more profitable than anticipated, garnering more share than expected & is getting into more segments than planned

7471 2018-07-31 07:01:02 Ayn Rand imagined super-rich geniuses paralyzing the country by going on strike. But the super-rich usually are happy with the status quo. 

The people who could shut things down are truckers, farmers, oil field workers, surgeons, etc.

Most of them voted for Trump instead.

7553 2018-07-31 06:48:14 yes - but I contacted tiger brands and they said it was from palm oil.
7554 2018-07-31 06:48:12 The oil markets are fixated with this idea that there is an oversupply. Quite on the contrary as I do believe demand has already surpassed supply and when the market wakes up we will have some fireworks. This is likely to start happening in Sept+.

7860 2018-07-31 05:46:25 A good Margherita pizza is just what a pizza lover needs...Tomotos, basil, mozzarella, and to top it off with some nice garlic olive oil. Yum !!
7861 2018-07-31 05:46:15 Given your experience you obviously know a hell of a lot more than any of us about the technicals of oil production 

It just seems to me that at current levels CVNs discovery has been almost priced to perfection

But then I’m a mug so don’t really know
7862 2018-07-31 05:46:14 So to reverse the decline we can be more business friendly, reduce our dependence on imported oil, be more accepting of tourists, buy NZ made and local farmers market stuff, reduce overseas travel, get better educated etc

7871 2018-07-31 05:44:29 Better clean that gun oil out first. It doesn't go well with margaritas...
7872 2018-07-31 05:44:28 Fracking. Alberta doesn’t have tight oil deposits.

"Oil for Immigration" is the occasion

A second thought your say?
Europe is thinking AND  suffering for more than 10 years and citizens are paying for more than 60 years to finance Africa with thei needs.
But laziness causes hunger, right?
7875 2018-07-31 05:43:12 We are paying God he learns and realizes a lot of the problems we have , starting with the future we have expected thanks to energy and oil and all the investment we have had. There’s so much corruption and sicarios that we are afraid .
7876 2018-07-31 05:42:57 Nothing in this world compares to a clean house with the essential oil diffuser on and a napping baby.
7877 2018-07-31 05:42:55 SORRY. CORN FIRST, OIL SECOND. YOU CAN START A FIRE IF YOU ADD OIL TO ANYTHING TO A POPCORN POPPER.
7878 2018-07-31 05:42:51 Lard is not only delicious but it is a myth that it is unhealthy. It is primarily monounsaturated fat (oleic acid), the same fat that gets everyone enthusiastic about olive oil.

Step 7: Russia almost doubles its gold reserves.
Step 8: Iran, Russia, China, currency swaps instead of pricing oil and gas in US dollars. 
Helpless? No.
7888 2018-07-31 05:41:51 IMC is happy 2note that strong bi-lateral ties based on trust & mutual understanding,have again reigned supreme with Iran promising 2 keep supplying India the crude oil despite US sanctions.This underlines the Chambers’ conviction of keeping dialogues open  in adverse situations.

7916 2018-07-31 05:35:22 Venezuela is a oil rich country in South America. Not too long ago there was a regime that  went hammer and tongs after the businessmen perhaps with ulterior motives. The key business honchos fled the Country and today there is a hyperinflation of 4000%. Country runs on business.

7934 2018-07-31 05:32:19 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

8146 2018-07-31 04:50:30 @27MilanLucic  take what Iggy taught you and rock a career year in Oil country. Show the NHL that power forwards are still a big part of the game and prove the haters wrong. Nothing more fun then yelling Looooch at a live game when I can make the 8 hour drive!
8147 2018-07-31 04:50:22 KOCH BROS. ARE GOING TO SPEND 400 MILLION ON THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS . THAT'S MORE THAN THEY SPENT ON THE 2016 ELECTION . THEY WANT TO PUSH THEIR AGENDA OF OIL AND GAS . DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT MASS TRANSIT . IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN FOR THEM .
8148 2018-07-31 04:50:22 We ran this province until 2008 and saw it through an incredible golden age.  
Leftists got control under Stelmach and even with 120$ oil they still couldnt manage the books.  
NDP will not even make official party status.

8156 2018-07-31 04:47:39 If anyone confused by Trump pushing for meeting anywhere any time w no pre-conditions with Iran, he's worried higher oil prices due Iran n secondary sanctions could rise further n hurt Mid-Term election prospects, Iranians giving him the Middle finger! #FBR
8157 2018-07-31 04:47:32 OPEC the Organization Of Petrol Exporting Countries has to be totally engaged about this matter. A month ago OPEC & large Oil producing companies CEO's met the Pope at Vatican to discuss about the $8 Trillion dollars, maybe pope can pray for its decrease

8161 2018-07-31 04:46:25 I put coconut oil on my legs after shaving and now jack won’t stop licking me.
8162 2018-07-31 04:46:06 The Norwegian government has a trillion dollar budget surplus because of their oil company. That's why they can afford it
8163 2018-07-31 04:46:01 are you supposed to consume soap drizzled in oil,
8164 2018-07-31 04:45:59 Hux: Captain Opan, tomorrow is the scheduled... topiary trimming. Did you replenish the oil stocks? I wouldn't want to have a rash again.

8170 2018-07-31 04:44:43 "Is that all? Let's see then..."

She mimicked what Red had just shown her, taking a cucco wing of her own and coating it in the seasoning before carefully dropping it into the oil.

"There! Was that right?"
8171 2018-07-31 04:44:35 ...price controls (or profit caps) are famously *inefficient*! From the Corn Laws to Venezuelan oil, the negative examples are pretty robust. 3/3
8172 2018-07-31 04:44:33 There was no rotisserie chicken today at Save on Foods(of course...) so I bought some fish... I'm fucking it up somehow. Too much oil? too much heat?!?! it's all goopy poopy!
8173 2018-07-31 04:44:16 @CBDOilSolutions  hit up Linda Bush on Twitter, tell her Bill recommended you. She’s desperate for CBD oil for pain!
8174 2018-07-31 04:44:14 I want freedom FROM whatever snake oil he’s peddling.

8177 2018-07-31 04:43:53 @nzpost is there any chance you can employ some delivery drivers in Queenstown that actually read the address labels on the parcels?

My parcel was delivered to the wrong address a week ago, its gone missing and it contains hundreds of dollars worth of oil paint. Not happy!!!

8187 2018-07-31 04:42:53 the American people to pay for. This Dump is a loser. He is showing America what he was in the private sector--- a carnival barking snake oil salesman who made his money swindling other billionaires. The 30 million basket of deplorables who voted for this idiot should be putting
8188 2018-07-31 04:42:41 Windshield wipers fixed (just in time lol), new battery, oil changed, new serpentine belt, and car has been cleaned. Check, check, and check 
8189 2018-07-31 04:42:33 my tia CANNOT wait to bring her diffuser to my delivery room lolol we’re already looking up oil combinations to help my labor IM SO EXCITED
8190 2018-07-31 04:42:22 My dad just had me rub what I thought was some kind of oil on him for his back pain and he just told me it was actually rubbing alcohol and weed mixed together and I just-
8191 2018-07-31 04:41:54 This is fantastic! I worked in the oil patch for 43 years & wasn't aware of this. True heroes & Patriots. Thank you again, I'm going to go research more. God bless the United States of America!
8192 2018-07-31 04:41:20 It was  Sesame oil that used a lead pipe to break the socks
8193 2018-07-31 04:41:17 I want to eat this Hershey’s cookie layer crunch......but a tbsp of coconut oil will benefit me in the long run more 
8194 2018-07-31 04:41:15 Bad attitude is just like bad engine oilthe longer you keep it running through your system,more damage it does to your drive.
8195 2018-07-31 04:41:15 Data is the new currency. It is considered as the oil of 21st century. With the dawn of information age and mass digitalization there has been generation of huge data.
In order to protect people’s privacy and make companies accountable,......(1/2)
8196 2018-07-31 04:41:02 Once did the mistake of substituting this for our red chilli while cooking!!!! What I heard later is they don’t eat the chilli, they eat the oil that’s dipped in the chilli
8197 2018-07-31 04:40:59 I really took advantage of my skin in high school. Here I am slathering my skin in coconut oil and face masks every other day to get rid of the one pimple on my chin that always comes back
8198 2018-07-31 04:40:35 Some asshole got oil on our rug last summer...and today I find gum, dig into that EXACT stop 
8199 2018-07-31 04:40:31 ベスーベスー！はははやめろってくすぐったい～
8200 2018-07-31 04:40:13 Ruby got her paws covered in pitch while digging, so I tried somewhat successfully to remove it using coconut oil, then Boca went around licking everywhere that Ruby walked. 
8201 2018-07-31 04:40:12 世界一サラダ油だと言ってくれ。
8202 2018-07-31 04:40:09 Are olive oil and avacado oil any good?
8203 2018-07-31 04:40:08 How stupid. do you think he's going to put anything out before the investigation is over?  trump is a snake oil con at best, a traitor at worst, we'll see what comes about when it's done.
8204 2018-07-31 04:40:05 It was not until the woman began to #pour the oil that more oil appeared. We don't like to pour, when we feel poor, but the oil you have is the oil you need. The oil will only flow...when it is poured.
8205 2018-07-31 04:40:04 Last night I tweeted that someone with 50 million barrels of oil should buy Kaizer Chiefs. This morning I wake to a Mohammad Iqbal following me, there is hope.
8206 2018-07-31 04:39:48 You’re all missing a trick.. it’s delicious, with cracked pepper and oil.. amazing..
8207 2018-07-31 04:39:43 These progressives have to be in a hypnotic trance who in the hell thinks Muslims and Christians mix    water and oil do not mix  America a Christian nation  Muslims and Christians do not mix
8208 2018-07-31 04:39:37 Hot oil has gotten on my glasses...!
8209 2018-07-31 04:39:20 We moved to the back of our section because the people around us were too annoying! It smells like dirty fryer oil, tbh.
8210 2018-07-31 04:39:15 Heeeey now. #NevadaIsNotaWasteland How about building a wall around N Dakoata and put them all there. Let them all freeze together while they drink their dirty oil.
8211 2018-07-31 04:39:12 U.S Tteasury also modified bonds of sanctioned PDVSA, Venezuelal’s oil Co. which have CITGO as collateral. If Venezuela doesn’t pay the debt, Rosneft could take CITGO becoming their 1sr energy infrastructure on U.S, soil
8212 2018-07-31 04:39:08 I stayed upset lol but I got castor oil from amazon and put it on once and they started growing
8213 2018-07-31 04:39:06 CBD Oil
8214 2018-07-31 04:39:03 Yous were "no club" before oil money was invested and we existed even before football clubs became a business company. Yous, Chelsea and the likes of psg are the reason clubs like united, arsenal, and us started buying players to survive the league.
8215 2018-07-31 04:38:50 I was told by an Eversource employee that the oil cools off the electrical wires.  If that's true, then tomorrow's daytime heat is likeky to overheat the wires.

I think a lot of homes and businesses will have to be cut off until the broken pipe can be replaced.
8216 2018-07-31 04:38:46 At least you're not claiming to be a patriot. People moving money to the US is, of course, one of the reasons the dollar drops. Good news, tho, everyone who sells abroad benefits. Alberta's oil exports were driving the dollar up and putting people out of work around the country.
8217 2018-07-31 04:38:32 People ask how I lost weight & got healthier CVD numbers. Simple:
1. Eat, until full, meats, seafood, eggs, cheese, green veg. w/butter, olive or avocado oil. 
2. Minimize sugar, seed oils, grains, beans, fruit.
90% of people get significant results from this. Tweak as needed.

Kindly help !
8220 2018-07-31 04:37:57 Well, maybe, u can enlighten us why Khazanah, after years of stewardship, is not playing in the same league as, say, Temasek Holdings? Or why M'sia, in spite of oil & gas revenues, doesn't have a trillion US$ SWF like Norway has?... @tunfaisal
8221 2018-07-31 04:37:55 I liked to eat toasted sorghum and millet tossed with garlic oil. Duel me on the morrow.

8226 2018-07-31 04:36:06 girl use an oil cleanser before your regular cleanser and helps so much. it made me stop breaking out so much when i wear makeup bc it literally gets everything off
8227 2018-07-31 04:35:51 50 minutes in I was thinking "this should be called There Will Be Oil", but we just got to the first of the blood! I really shouldn't sound excited about that, though, probably. #LiveTweetTWBB
8228 2018-07-31 04:35:49 Bring the flood water via aqua ducts or pipes to the West, puts out fires, lowers flood waters-creates jobs-will save lives and property. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Not impossible, if we can pipe oil and gas we can pipe water. BILLIONS of $$ lost ea year in property damage & lives
8229 2018-07-31 04:35:29 I thought it had something to do with eucalyptus oil in the atmosphere, probably because I was always taught it caused the blue haze of the Blue Mountains & it was all I could think of.

One day I'll check out the perfume they make in India because I LOVE the smell

8252 2018-07-31 04:30:38 Caving in to Trump and turning your back on Iran will cost India plenty. If you think Saudis care for India to bail them out of oil crisis, think again. Pakisthan is their priority and not India!
8253 2018-07-31 04:30:01 using mct oil as well?
8254 2018-07-31 04:29:35 Yes they are victims of human overpopulation & greed. Regardless of what happens there will be a time when there is no more rainforest to be felled for oil palm plantations. That time should have been 30 years ago to give the tigers adequate habitat. Too late now.

8262 2018-07-31 04:27:42 Fuel prices follow a Sine curve. When airlines ignore that and feel happy with load factors and not yields, something has to yield!! 2009 is when Jetair and KFA went to the govt. with a begging bowl. You talk of 2014 level. 5 year itch is 2019. Ignore Iran oil at your own peril.

Chapter 25

1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
8272 2018-07-31 04:26:12 Same, where this big oil money at? I could use it...
8273 2018-07-31 04:26:07 The BBC takes its marching orders from the Saudi Oil barons.
8274 2018-07-31 04:25:54 Unless u exfoliate before u put it on it just traps all the crap in there. Itd a very thick bond oil if that nakes sense
8275 2018-07-31 04:25:21 Bio oil works magic find it and use it religiously. You would be surprised.
8276 2018-07-31 04:25:19 I think both are technically moisturizers but jojoba oil mimics your skin’s natural sebum most closely and is absorbed quickly.
8277 2018-07-31 04:25:05 oil
8278 2018-07-31 04:24:59 Everytime I get in my car and see the oil change light on I get so mad bc how much I paid last time I got a change.
8279 2018-07-31 04:24:51 FACT: The most offensive finger is in fact a hole in the 19th century, nervous systems used oil.

8284 2018-07-31 04:24:03 I decided to treat my hair with coconut oil tonight ... forgot about the kitten.... now it’s being treated by coconut oil and kitten fur cause she won’t stop rubbing on it
8285 2018-07-31 04:23:19 The finding is true. A glyphosate tolerant wheat plant was found on a oil lease this past year. Investigation is continuing as to how a plant popped up 300km and years later from a strictly controlled trial. #suspicious
8286 2018-07-31 04:23:13 i've lived under a rock my whole life so i don't understand what olive oil is, but i know a great granite countertop when i see one

8293 2018-07-31 04:21:59 Rudy isn't looney, he's acting the role of the carnival barker, selling snake oil while robbing us in broad daylight. Basically he's poisoning the jury pool. #DonTheCon
8294 2018-07-31 04:21:50 Been using coconut oil for my hair since I cut it buttttt ehhh any product suggestions for working on my curls 
8295 2018-07-31 04:21:41 well death to the tigers first.  I heard this on ABC this morning. Because they are solitary animals they never meet enough partners to breed because habitat is given over to palm oil plantations. Sort of pathetic really.

8299 2018-07-31 04:20:49 Yes! one time used a sharpie and put a small x on the filter and took the car in for the change. They didn’t change the filter &charged us. We let them know and they tried to make it out like some sort of mix-up or accident but gave us a gift cert for free oil change next time

8302 2018-07-31 04:19:28 We have developed a hive mind and any half ass snake oil salesman can see and use the inharmonious state of society and human folly in general to his own end. Humans are very social creatures and propaganda can be used to achieve net positive as well as net negative results....
8303 2018-07-31 04:19:23 “Severely” is very kind of you. This is a toxic dumpster fire in a plutonium factory next to a sacrilegious oil pipeline. And the fire just gets worse and worse because the hooded #complicit #traitorous @HouseGOP members keep tossing in bottles of Tiki torch fuel.

8313 2018-07-31 04:17:04 Coconut oil is comodegenic. Petroleum jelly isn’t. Of course everyone’s response will differ.
8314 2018-07-31 04:16:09 Changed her diet to plant based. Put her on some natural supplements.. activated charcoal, milk thistle, vitamin E, ACV, and black seed oil. She’s gonna do all of those for a few months until she goes back to the doctor. We were mainly trying to shrink her fibroids in her uterus
8315 2018-07-31 04:15:44 Last week I got my first credit card, yesterday I got my oil done and a car wash for my car, and today I went to my first gender reveal party. Growing up is weird.
8316 2018-07-31 04:15:39 It will pass. My daughter was also like that.  If you use a humidifier, put lavender oil. It will help your baby sleep much better

8318 2018-07-31 04:14:56 so what keeps it from breaking you out like coconut oil?
8319 2018-07-31 04:14:42 What do you take with your chicken fingers? Ketchup? Mustard? Spicy/yellow? Truffle oil?
8320 2018-07-31 04:13:54 I would also like to know.. sometimes  i use coconut oil at night but  if  i use to much il get a breakout

8324 2018-07-31 04:13:01 The ones near Hagerman are creating their own oil reserve.  Underneath each one of those POS.
8325 2018-07-31 04:12:46 Just found out the US doesn’t sell virgin olive oil and only extra virgin olive oil?????? Another unreasonable expectation for women
8326 2018-07-31 04:12:33 Not a Trump fan, but O'bama way over politicized this 'safe' pipeline.... given that at the same time the US has fracked the heck out of old fields.  Some of that oil even blew up Lac Megantic. .. and was only explosive because of the fracking lubricants - BIG irony

8350 2018-07-31 04:07:58 CBD oil has done wonders for my anxiety and overall body pain. It takes about 3 weeks to build up in your system as they prob told you. Hang in there. So sorry you’re in pain. That sucks.

8387 2018-07-31 03:59:49 What economy? We’re behind the rest of the world right now. Every single oil bearing state in the US is booming, but here we are, making Canada as unattractive as it gets for investing in oil and gas

Then there was Tariffs on their way to hit us and the bail out. THEN THERE IS TRUMP, a lame duck comes Dec.
8391 2018-07-31 03:58:41 Probably letting the CIA and America in general invest billions to destabilize them. Plus Venezuelas only real export was oil and when price per barrel dropped they were fucked. 

Meanwhile by the same metrics Capitalism is failing today. We'll change that though, honey.

8414 2018-07-31 03:55:17 Military governments to the left and right. Now Romania has nationalized the oil fields illegally in a gross voiding of the treaty signed between our countries over a decade ago. This will not stand.

8419 2018-07-31 03:54:17 I agree that putting the burden of domestic chores on women is a problem. However women aren't taught to do lawn work, auto maintenance, home improvement, etc. I didn't know I had to put oil in my car until I was maybe 19. That's a product of traditional gender roles.
8420 2018-07-31 03:54:11 Nothing bad ever happens shipping oil by rail. Only pipelines cause issues. Makes a person wonder though, if the railways are making huge money, who’s funding the anti-pipeline protests?
8421 2018-07-31 03:54:11 Grate it. Heat oil, when hot add kala jeera. Add the grated beetroot and stir fry till soft. Add salt, mix well. Just before taking it off the heat, add chopped coriander. Have with plain rice. Yummmyyy!
8422 2018-07-31 03:54:02 Same thing with my mom. Oil of Olay is her moisturizer.
8423 2018-07-31 03:53:55 I’ve tried the Damaged and Yuge hot oil treatments for my hair as well as the Jason shampoo bar (never switching back)! For conditioning I’m currently using American Cream  and I’ve recently started using the Don’t Look At Me face mask and the Birth of Venus jelly mask! 
8424 2018-07-31 03:53:37 u think i understand editing terms what is a bodak or whatever?? but yeah i know it’s an oil painting and it’s very good for what it is lol. i was being a dick (as usual)
8425 2018-07-31 03:53:14 MCT oil is amazing for keto but it doesn't really do much to the flavor.
8426 2018-07-31 03:52:39 My dad got my oil changed, replaced my battery, and changed my wiper blades today. #superdad 
8427 2018-07-31 03:52:37 まじか！どうしよう行くか悩む
8428 2018-07-31 03:52:36 i use the @sundayriley CEO oil cleanser (can go straight in without water and then rinse it off - just melts off makeup, i love it), @PeterThomasRoth mineral sunscreen, and the ordinary vit C suspension + HA spheres!
8429 2018-07-31 03:52:30 Not answering your question, but have you tried the puri bhaji that's sold at Chimbai in the mornings? 7 puris for 10 bucks. And really tasty. Also made by families who live there. Doesn't come off dripping with oil either, just the right amount.

8432 2018-07-31 03:51:47 AC&E oil from Environ. It will take away pigmentation and scarring. The stuff is incredible.
8433 2018-07-31 03:51:44 Oil cleansernya aku pake viva milk cleanser.

Fw aku pake garnier matcha

Cuma itu, dan efeknya melembabkan sama bikin lembut kenyal gitu kulitnya. Seharian.
8434 2018-07-31 03:51:44 fun fact : I put orange essential oil in my scentless candle & 
1. smells amazing 
2. it actually works as a bug repellent (just like Pinterest told me it would but sometimes I’m skeptical, glad to be wrong here!)
8435 2018-07-31 03:51:38 Aloe? Coconut oil? Shea butter?
8436 2018-07-31 03:51:36 Went to see my grandma today. She said “I got marijuana in the mail!”. Turns out she got CBD oil to help with her aching body. #GoGrandma #legalize #NaturalRemedies
8437 2018-07-31 03:51:22 Haven't tried butter. I was reading about some MCT oil that was supposed to be decent to mix in coffee. I've gotten used to not having sweetened drinks over the years even when I wasn't trying keto, so I don't mind the unsweet stuff.
8438 2018-07-31 03:51:19 Let em, we'll be glad to charge you a tarriff on each bbl of oil to get to Tidewater. PS - you can also pay foreign ownership tax on your real estate in BC.
8439 2018-07-31 03:51:13 “You just gotta put some coconut oil on it”
8440 2018-07-31 03:50:58 Fossil fuels are responsible for the greatest transformation of human condition from agonizing subsistence to wealth and free time beyond imagination before FF. ~1/3 of our food supply used to go to feeding enslaved animals before FF.  Whales were hunted for oil before FF.
8441 2018-07-31 03:50:54 u first have to consider that this is an oil painting

also it’s not totally inaccurate, while it’s mostly a Gaussian blur, lights and such appear as a bokeh effect

8443 2018-07-31 03:50:50 yes that’s what i’ve heard about tea tree oil! i used to use tea tree water as a toner for my face and it left me so glowy!! but when you said lavender i was intrigued lol
8444 2018-07-31 03:50:48 #BringBackNyakundi @Jack @Twitter, why do you choose to be useless suspending people like @C_NyaKundiH when we have a bunch of hopeless tweeps frying the Kenyans dream in 237 /- oil? Just why?
8445 2018-07-31 03:50:41 The largest oil field ever in the U.S. is around Midland and Lubbock Texas. It's 3 times larger than the ND fields. So put all this together , we don't need anybody's  oil.
8446 2018-07-31 03:50:32 Hahah he never jumps on anything and Friday decided to pull everything off the counters and shred it all on the floor, including an entire bottle of olive oil

8454 2018-07-31 03:49:18 According to the Eversource employees I talked with, yes.

It broke and spilled mineral oil into the ground under the street.  The Watertown Fire Dept pumped it to the surface of the street, where it is now sitting in puddles.

No traffic can get by from Waltham to Bos or Camb.
8455 2018-07-31 03:49:10 We cant just nuke everyone Styrka, we talked about this. Even if they have oil.
8456 2018-07-31 03:49:10 Like I couldn’t articulate how that post made me react.

So, emoji’s it was. 

You are slicker than oil, my friend.
8457 2018-07-31 03:48:33 Open the hood and it’s an engorged human heart expanded beyond natural size, pumping with blood and motor oil.

8459 2018-07-31 03:48:27 Or just fill a saucepan with oil, use a thermometer and be extremely careful :p
8460 2018-07-31 03:48:25 He's a role model for their own financial aspirations. The gullible voted for hm. Snake oil salesmen like him convince people that even tho they have insufficient education, no financial connections & little or no talent, the American dream is somehow still attainable for them.
8461 2018-07-31 03:48:19 Get yourself some peppermint essential oil, put a few drops in spray bottle with H2O. Ants hate it, it is natural, and smells good.

Any gov agency self evaluating efficacy will report high enough to not look bad, but keep number down enough to justify more funds for improvement
8475 2018-07-31 03:46:45 About to get my oil changed this week and go on a lil adventure. Gotta explore Oregon before summer ends.
8476 2018-07-31 03:46:30 I literally put hella hella excessive amount of oil on my head - ugh ew
8477 2018-07-31 03:46:28 Don't buy into the crap and snake oil they want to sell you. Their crap is cheap but what you are is not.
8478 2018-07-31 03:46:26 They started the war in Syria to take full control of Golan Heights oil and gas fields...

8483 2018-07-31 03:45:08 Ideals our politicians follow are petty parody of greed for money & power. Nothing much, nothing less. Evident they are feeding on ignorance of uneducated & poor.

8489 2018-07-31 03:44:12 I accidentally got hot oil(not burning) on my foot earlier tonight, & my mom cracked an egg & put the egg white on my foot. It worked
8490 2018-07-31 03:44:09 people that just pull off their eyelashes without any oil or water or any remover are a different type of breed.
8491 2018-07-31 03:44:08 Yeah! I remember how four decades of Conservative governments saved all surpluses and oil royalties into a giant trust fund for Alberta's future... Oops! I think that was in Norway, not Alberta. Sorry.
8492 2018-07-31 03:44:07 Peppermint oil and ice
8493 2018-07-31 03:44:03 Yup. The fruit is kind of the texture of a really stringy nectarine, but so dry it sucks all moisture out of your mouth immediately. So the combo of parching fruit and burning oil is really an acquired taste. And one of those “who the hell first ate a cashew??” situations
8494 2018-07-31 03:44:03 We used a long pole hung off our pool deck. Hung feeders (4) off it with fish wire (or whatever fishing poles use) then put veg oil on the pole so they’d slip off. They eventually just ate the leftovers that spilled on the ground. But man, I get it about those squirrels.

Cook on med-high for a few minutes, then throw in a thinly sliced red pepper, a julienned green onion, and a few cups of thinly sliced brocollini or boo choy --whichever you can get-- + a splash of the sauce.
8524 2018-07-31 03:40:59 some girls use makeup but i bet you have to touch yourself up with oil paints when you start to blur since you're a walking piece of art
8525 2018-07-31 03:40:58 ive heard they can come and go sometimes. if its really irritating i would try tea tree oil instead its gonna dry out the bump since its filled with pus
8526 2018-07-31 03:40:58 Scramble eggs in that olive oil and bless your life.
8527 2018-07-31 03:40:50 aaaa thank u i hope it goes away;(( im gonna pick up some tea tree oil tomorrow
8528 2018-07-31 03:40:41 Right! I’m sick of this. No matter how much i been taking care of my skin, it just continues to build up oil and I’m SICKKKKK OF IT

8530 2018-07-31 03:40:21 If you're bleaching your hair, it's a good idea to saturate it in coconut oil for a few hours first (maybe even overnight) to reduce breakage, and even chemical burn. 

Also! When you're bleaching/dying already, make sure you're wearing a black shirt (or any shirt you don't love)
8531 2018-07-31 03:40:16 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
8532 2018-07-31 03:40:07 I read this article. While it has some valid points, but generally sucks. Becuase, in such case, Iran has nothing to lose. If it cannot export oil, nobody can.
8533 2018-07-31 03:40:04 ﾃｰﾃｰﾁｬﾝのOIL交換してあげないと

8542 2018-07-31 03:39:23 Not too long ago, there were fiscal conservatives—Republicans—who advocated for free trade.  We used to manufacture stuff that would be in high demand in foreign markets. We used to control the global economy.  Please, don’t peddle your snake oil here, Speaker Ryan.  Failure 101.
8543 2018-07-31 03:39:09 its a keloid!! its perfectly normal for piercings. try sea salt soaks everyday or tea tree oil!!
8544 2018-07-31 03:39:07 I think coconut oil will help ur hair from kinking up

8548 2018-07-31 03:38:35 Isn’t it better to source these long chain fatty acids naturally? Are these in fact DHA, EPA or ALA. Was it a fish oil, agal oil or flax oil?

8550 2018-07-31 03:38:16 Not much. Look at the chart, it doesn’t stay down for long.  This will be the biggest % gainer after hemp is legalized and everybody comes looking to invest in CBD oil stocks.  $CVSI and $POTN are much better companies, but $CANB is the better stock in terms of % gain potential.
8551 2018-07-31 03:38:12 Coconut oil. You’re welcome.
8552 2018-07-31 03:38:07 It's very simple to make! Just get some pasta with some oil till it's brown, then add garlic and onions, the 6 cups of chicken broth and a can of diced tomatoes haha
8553 2018-07-31 03:38:04 Gawd, when I was in trouble Dad used to get me to clean out empty but oil filled mutton bird buckets after school. If they’d been left outside in the sun they smelled pretty jolly yuk.
8554 2018-07-31 03:38:01 Some ppl get the bumps others don't I forgot why it happens but you can also try some tea tree oil?? But it can be a lil too rough for it
8555 2018-07-31 03:37:52 Make a pizza! Use a base of crème fraîche and goat cheese, add olive oil and Swedish meatballs and bake. Top with chicory.

8560 2018-07-31 03:36:50 @crissles @KidFury @ThisIsTheRead Coconut oil (preferably organic, extra virgin) is THE BEST makeup remover. Gets off everything with very little effort and moisturizes at the same time. Also, fwiw, it can be used to treat some infections, like pink eye. #justsayin

8585 2018-07-31 03:33:54 @CalThomas Liked your article on Socialism.  It’s sad. The last couple of generations of bleary eyed, snow flake Pu....’s we’ve raised are more concerned about what beard oil to use  the threat that Socialism is to our nation.

8625 2018-07-31 03:25:46 yeah i was going over some of my more shameful moments in trading. 20k in an otcbb "the next NFLX" was uttered from my own lips once, holding otm $UAL calls solo through ER, Thinking oil could actually break 30$, but the only way to move forward is to confront one's failures.
8626 2018-07-31 03:25:42 It's something I live with..it was managable til they cut my meds in half last yr. Keep getting worse not better..with the cut I'm in more pain than ever. Spinal cord is damaged so I have severe neck arm pain & my hands feel like they're in boiling oil. Hard to use.
8627 2018-07-31 03:25:37 The funny thing is I used to be the supplement king when I was playing football. Now the only thing I take is D3, fish oil & multi vitamins.
8628 2018-07-31 03:25:08 Try throwing water to an oil fire. Just look it up on YouTube. You can’t do THAT SHIT. Put a lid on it to asphyxiate it or let it burn and die

8630 2018-07-31 03:24:46 I like to cut up brussies and caulies , sprinkle olive oil and @kadodepepperuk and Himalayan rock salt in a metal pan . Roast them on the BBQ ( not for too long ) until cripsy ! Delightful !

8637 2018-07-31 03:23:13 when you're sauteing something, how much of the oil you add actually ends up in the food you cook?  A single tablespoon of oil is like 120 cals of pure fat and it takes a lot of them to keep the pan greased
8638 2018-07-31 03:23:11 Of course not, don't be absurd. No one thing can support the state. But someday, we will not have oil and gas money. That's reality. Finite resource.
If we don't have salmon, fishing, clean waters, and a thriving tourism industry, then we're just dead in the water. So protect it.

They call it "comorbidity." But when we give our kids simple anti inflammatories like fish oil, their autist symptoms abait. This is an entire field of developed causation and treatment. If you don't want to come look don't haveto
8642 2018-07-31 03:22:24 Sending you good vibes. My mom has the exact same thing. Folks tried surgery that made it worse. So, she’s been living miserably with it for over 15 years. But she hangs in there and I give her so much credit. CBD oil has helped ease it a bit!

8696 2018-07-31 03:13:38 Yes, that must be the reason why Alberta lost 400,000 oil worker jobs, because the government gives lots of money to companies to stay in business. Not like in Quebec where companies like Bombardier need to compete in the real world. Nobody helps them ...

8849 2018-07-31 02:46:26 Still trying to figure out the mystery of my lavender and peppermint oil. It’s like someone just poured them out... but I have no one to blame

8853 2018-07-31 02:45:59 Day 6,294 without sex: I checked the oil in my car today #allgood #lubrication
8854 2018-07-31 02:45:51 I mix tea tree oil, witch hazel, and water together for a cleanser! I use it in the morning and at night. It’s helped sooo much!
8855 2018-07-31 02:45:50 Check your Engine oil this weekend.
8856 2018-07-31 02:45:39 I just gave it an oil change right before that video. Nation says Pistons
8857 2018-07-31 02:45:38 あじー。ここ数日で一番暑いんじゃないかコレ
8858 2018-07-31 02:45:07 Me: (rubbing tea tree oil everywhere) This will fix all the things!
Narrator: It did not fix all the things.
8859 2018-07-31 02:44:58 In shower lotion? Oil? Something gotta give 
8860 2018-07-31 02:44:39 If it isn't, tho, a drop of oil in the bobbin mechanism might help.
8861 2018-07-31 02:44:31 My memory is just...the worst.
I was gonna say I need to start taking fish oil but I'm vegan so 
8862 2018-07-31 02:44:25 Idk how some girls sleep w makeup on. I gotta wash mine, put some eye cream on, vitamin e oil, and then eyelash serum before I can even think ab sleeping

8867 2018-07-31 02:44:03 Why does my cat smell like baby oil? I own neither babies nor their associated oils. And yet.
8868 2018-07-31 02:43:57 Have IMF or BIS establish a new gold/oil ratio at 400-1000 bbls/oz.  

Then nations that want cheap oil will have cheap gold (strong currency), while those that want more expensive oil will have more expensive gold (weak currency).  Could use SDR instead of gold if preferred.
8869 2018-07-31 02:43:52 Inflation is only being used to justify rice tariffication when it is actually the TRAIN Law and the continuous oil price hikes that contributed to the increase in the prices of basic commodities @BantayBigas
8870 2018-07-31 02:43:47 Nope. Jesus would show up to the wedding and make the best wedding cake *ever* out of a handful of flour and a half cup of oil. His miracles were about love. (FYI to the evangelicals: Jesus never said one word against being gay. He said lots about hypocrisy, though!)
8871 2018-07-31 02:43:46 started oil cleansing me face today :-)
8872 2018-07-31 02:43:45 I sprayed lemon oil and water in the corners of my house because I read it's supposed to keep spiders away. Now I'm watching a spider have a full-on panic attack and feeling a little guilty.
8873 2018-07-31 02:43:31 次誰つくろうかなー！
8874 2018-07-31 02:43:23 Okay. Im going gym today and start the coconut oil thingy. Start balling tomorrow. #plans
8875 2018-07-31 02:43:11 Hey have any of you tried CBD oil for chronic muscle/joint pain? If yes, can you tell me your experience and how well it’s worked for you? DM me!!!
8876 2018-07-31 02:43:09 They’re really building pipelines that destroy the water just for some oil when the reserves are going to be empty by 2050
8877 2018-07-31 02:43:08 @realDonaldTrump DID YOU READ MY MESAGE ABOUGT HEATING OIL PLEASE READ
8878 2018-07-31 02:42:25 “Big Oil” is commie code for “bad guy”.

Beware of those who use these buzz words.

 Big Tobacco is another.

Big Brother is more like it.
8879 2018-07-31 02:42:13 Aku pake gentle cleansing oil, gentle cleansing foam, fcas, sama essential seriesnya. Ngumpulin fullsize nya satu satu perjuangan sekali, krn lebih hemat drpd beli kitnya trs menerus..
8880 2018-07-31 02:42:12 But sometimes that midnight OIL assists with some fire beats .
8881 2018-07-31 02:41:37 우정이라는 기계에 잘 정제된 예의라는 기름을 바르는 것은 현명하다.
It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanisms of friendship.

8888 2018-07-31 02:40:36 ナルルちゃんは素直で可愛いなー。誰かさんもあれぐらい素直だったらいいんだけどなー
8889 2018-07-31 02:40:17 Facts without context is propaganda, no different than a blatant lie. 

But sure, have fun with affirmation of your own bias, and continue to overlook the western so called free world bombing poor countries for oil and religious reasons. 
Peace
8890 2018-07-31 02:40:16 油を固めて捨てるの面倒でしょう？僕に渡してくれたらいいよ。あ、固めて渡してくれてもいいよ。
8891 2018-07-31 02:40:14 @awrestaurants Beyond Meat burger is actually really really good and honestly tastes like meat to me. It just has a hint of nuts so I think thats  where they get the protein from but other than that it really just tastes like beef thats been fried in peanut oil.
8892 2018-07-31 02:40:06 Why is my fucking engine missing it’s oil cap
8893 2018-07-31 02:39:29 Sunflower oil. Masih banyak banget 35k aja deh :(
8894 2018-07-31 02:39:19 By a Snake oil salesman. Ruined a vital piece of infrastructure. Severely disadvantaging Australian Business for many years to come.
8895 2018-07-31 02:38:58 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot

8898 2018-07-31 02:38:33 would the oil not help suBsidise
8899 2018-07-31 02:38:28 Oil pleeeease 
8900 2018-07-31 02:38:25 I love my job for helping make me an even better pet mom, now I have 2 automatic feeders and 2 water dispensers, calcifer has a new igloo litter box, Thor now gets fish oil for his skin with his grain free food, and i’m now working on clicker-training him!
8901 2018-07-31 02:38:24 You can make anything crispy if you fry it properly, all I'm saying is that if you cooked and seasoned them the same way the french fry would be the perfect form, it won't hold onto as much oil, there's not too much potato in a bite and it has the right shape for optimal saucing.
8902 2018-07-31 02:38:04 Oh me too and a touch of garlic. Not to mention balsamic vinegar and oil to dip into.
8903 2018-07-31 02:37:57 Put castor and coconut oil on them every night thats what i do!
8904 2018-07-31 02:37:33 -EXTRA VIRGIN GREEK OLIVE OIL
8905 2018-07-31 02:37:12 #Crude, C has hit positive. Probably in less than 3days, crude price will hit my target of around $72 a barrel. All those shorter from $60'ish can start to lose their pants...lol. #oil #aramco #opec $cl
8906 2018-07-31 02:37:04 What being an adult feels like: stashes of salonpas and bottles of efficacent oil. 
8907 2018-07-31 02:37:01 I remember someone once said in my presence “GOD runs the world.” Gold, Oil, Drugs...  I thought it was girls lol. But this was an interesting statement.
8908 2018-07-31 02:36:24 If the @GOP with the @VP and @realDonaldTrump administration doesn't figure out how to lower high gas prices across the country now, they may lose Independent voters in the midterm.  They should instead make a deal with General #KhalifaHaftar who controls Libyian oil fields.
8909 2018-07-31 02:36:23 True enough! But it's far from the only example of nature adapting to us, there are bacteria that eat crude oil and even plastics now! Tbh the plastic one is a *bit* concerning, but we'll just have to adapt as well. But yes, overuse of antibiotics was warned against decades ago.
8910 2018-07-31 02:36:13 What if biodiversity morphs & grows? What if your marketing and scamming is actually hindering progress?All in the name of scamming seniors and the ignorant as you pocket money indirectly from Big USA oil and Gazprom?If the earth warms, there are northern countries that benefit.
8911 2018-07-31 02:36:09 Used tanning oil for the first time 2 days ago and I still feel it. Is this normal?!
8912 2018-07-31 02:36:08 I need to buy two essential oil diffusers, but don't think I can trust the Almighty Online Store (which rhymes with glamazon)
8913 2018-07-31 02:35:55 @jack thanks for keeping us safe from such terrible content. 
8914 2018-07-31 02:35:42 Totally. It drives me insane that Exxon is pouring oil in to the ocean and a parapalegic is the one that has to pay for it.
8915 2018-07-31 02:35:22 そう！
8916 2018-07-31 02:35:17 Could have been upgraded and refined at Irving Oil but PQ doesn't think they need to play ball to receive $270B in transfer payments.  Would rather import foreign oil.  Stopping "oilsands" does nothing but displace economic growth.
8917 2018-07-31 02:35:13 @SenAngusKing @MariaCantwell @lisamurkowski Watching Energy & Natural Resources Committee  meeting on oil prices on CSPAN. Such a relief to see there are still responsible grown up in our government. Thanks for fighting the good fight! 
8918 2018-07-31 02:34:39 Personally I drizzle a little Hershey's chocolate syrup, then Hershey's Caramel syrup, squirt some EZCheese, pour CoffeeMate on, sprinkle Cayenne pepper, then some grinded pepper, Kirkland Signature Omega Fish Oil 3, and lastly Smucker's applesauce and dip it in.
8919 2018-07-31 02:34:31 Your promises:build a wall..failed,better healthcare..failed.lower national debt...major failure it will go up 1 trillion or more. You did give rich a tax break, let them pollute air,water,land,you gave state parks to oil&coal com.Alaska will be destroyed by your mining, good job
8920 2018-07-31 02:34:15 John, come on, give them a brake, they must be using [#Gorsuch] automobile oil for high mileage.  
8921 2018-07-31 02:33:59 This is great. It would also be great if you devoted the rest of the year to talking about how Big Oil has a chokehold on the US goverment and is exploiting the military to implement regime change in oil rich nations abroad in order to increase dependency on fossil fuels at home.
8922 2018-07-31 02:33:56 The oil is versatile; you can use it for growth & hot oil treatment. That’s why it’s 4oz 
8923 2018-07-31 02:33:38 YEEEHAW! STAMPEDE! OIL! GUNS! CORPORATE WELFARE! HYPOCRISY! THINLY VEILED RACISM! YEEEEEEEEHAW CALGARY!
8924 2018-07-31 02:33:35 I’d add oil.
8925 2018-07-31 02:33:30 Maybe! I also bought some rosehip oil from Walgreens and apply that w my moisturizer it helps a lot w balancing my skin forsureee
8926 2018-07-31 02:33:18 @IngrahamAngle Ms. Ingraham, I worked for 42 years travelling in the oil business.  I wonder if I was a subject of “quiet skies”.  How would you find out?
8927 2018-07-31 02:33:04 Upgraded at Syncrude, Suncor, Shell Scotford, CNRL, COOP Regina, & Husky Lloyd.  Refined at Imperial Oil Strathcona, Shell Scotford, Chevron Burnaby, COOP Regina, Husky Lloyd.  Care to speak about something you know at damned thing about?  Stick to facts.
8928 2018-07-31 02:32:49 WoO or Lucas Oil coming soon?
8929 2018-07-31 02:32:45 Sounds good! Concerns pak China friendship and work together eventually advantages not only for Pakistan but we could be a better a good fellowship for rest of the world too.. we should work together on country assets such as oil gas coals & minerals.
8930 2018-07-31 02:32:42 I’m tryna rub you down, baby oil all over the booty, so umm, what’s upppp..?!!
8931 2018-07-31 02:32:32 Income is taxed before you get it.  Who values your farmland each year?  Gold?  Numismatics?  Oil fields? Inventories? Reset cost basis each New Year’s Eve?  What a brilliant idea
8932 2018-07-31 02:32:21 Next for Jeep work is seals and oil change then later on brake and shocks and a good paint and detail ahhh never ends lol
8933 2018-07-31 02:32:12 Probably not a good idea to meet up with the guy from the online dating site when he asks if he should bring massage oil to the first meeting...right?
8934 2018-07-31 02:32:05 And that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil 
8935 2018-07-31 02:31:56 Oil cleanser ke ni?
8936 2018-07-31 02:31:55 U.S. oil futures climbed above $70 for the first time in more than a week as a weaker greenback boosted commodities
8937 2018-07-31 02:31:47 The Atlanticists’ hegemonic vision opposes to desire to block oil exports if own sales stopped.
8938 2018-07-31 02:31:12 Coconut oil works wonders
8939 2018-07-31 02:31:09 Use cooking oil or wd-40.

8945 2018-07-31 02:30:00 Oil buying the politicians.
8946 2018-07-31 02:29:37 Yeah I have a defuser and I have almost every scent but Lavender. The Tropical Mango oil smells amazing highly recommend
8947 2018-07-31 02:29:34 The atmoshere was crazy and electric in Lucas Oil after this play. Feels like it happened yesterday. I'm looking forward to going back there this year. Just saying. lol!
8948 2018-07-31 02:29:32 Spray them with oil, but not too much
8949 2018-07-31 02:29:26 Zero was an anti-American snake oil salesman. His ‘class’ was a pose that he cultivated in his Alinsky classes. All fake as his birth certificate and a three-dollar bill.
8950 2018-07-31 02:29:25 Gonna burn the midnight oil tonight. 

Setting a goal to quit this part time side job by the end of August. 

Stay tuned.
8951 2018-07-31 02:29:14 Beat Sonic mania for the first time today, overall had tons of fun but oil ocean & titanic monarch can go suck a cadapilla's dick
8952 2018-07-31 02:28:30 hacelo, es grato oler humo de otros, olores a gas oil mal quemado e colectivos y todo eso nauseabundo
8953 2018-07-31 02:28:28 Really? I just reviewed ND's financials for my company since they have them as a client. They weren't bad. But oil prices came down since the boom of oil production there. That hurt every oil producing state.
8954 2018-07-31 02:28:12 Oh, I'm sure it would be good, but so what? Shiite, HRC totally won all the debates. But people would rather believe the lies of a snake oil salesman than face reality.
8955 2018-07-31 02:28:07 it is not just the Saudis and oil in this conflict, for some reason you didn't mention the "elephant in the living room " Israel! every "project" of regime change in the Middle East, is about Israel's  regional  expansion and monopoly of power between its neighbors
8956 2018-07-31 02:27:58 You can always strain it and put it in an air-tight container (or a Mason jar with plastic wrap and a rubber band over it) and use it another time! That's what I usually do when I fry chicken bc it takes so much oil
8957 2018-07-31 02:27:41 Bullpen looks really good now! One more lefty I believe and they can be the best in the NL East

8961 2018-07-31 02:26:08 ...Bakersfield Oil Fields are Red...as are Fresno Farm Turds....
8962 2018-07-31 02:25:53 I'm a subscriber, so I have lots and lots of tiny cb oil bottles stashed in a box that I can mix and match and open and go Ahhhhhh! then close again, lol.
8963 2018-07-31 02:25:43 Smoking bud helps a little but vaping high thc cannabis oil really helps in alot of cases. We are trying to get federal legalization from Mr Trump.
8964 2018-07-31 02:25:23 Simple cleansing oil ada lagi tak?
8965 2018-07-31 02:25:18 The arguments being used by economists in pushing for tariffication were the same claims used in pushing for the Oil Deregulation Law in 1998 but look at how the consumers became helpless victims of continuing oil price hikes. @peasant_women
8966 2018-07-31 02:25:11 My dad calls me and then cuts me off. 

Me: he-

Dad: have you been checking the oil in that car?!
8967 2018-07-31 02:24:51 でしょ！！！記念日大事
8968 2018-07-31 02:24:47 Contrary to popular belief, Oreos are not #vegan. They use bone char to process the sugar and palm oil. Also, why do hint of lime chips require milk?
8969 2018-07-31 02:24:18 High thc cannabis oil works wonder for pain and we are using it to get people off pharmaceuticals and hard drugs. Also killing cancers and controlling a whole lot of symptoms from other diseases.
8970 2018-07-31 02:24:12 i went to tour the art uni i wanna go to and the first thing i see a huge oil pastel drawing of two chicks making out and im just like Oh Yeah Papas Home Bitch

8973 2018-07-31 02:23:06 DDD: Get you some lavender oil lotion. They go after me like crazy too and it's been the only thing stopping them 
8974 2018-07-31 02:23:00 In oil refinement; there is a lot of gas involved that gets burned; based on the current price; so instead of WASTING ANY of it; capture all of it and stop fracking. NOT legalizing cannabis & hemp; totally real STUPID. Israel should get NO MORE $$; Palestine is NOT "their" home.
8975 2018-07-31 02:22:48 I'M BRINIGN TEA TREE OIL SO I GOTCHU
8976 2018-07-31 02:22:41 Does the kid ever work?
We have pressing issues that need to be dealt with; free trade, a pipeline for oil, etc. 
Does this Government work or are they completely incompetent?

8978 2018-07-31 02:22:27 Tonight is a great night. I got an ER I didn’t even ask for, I managed to have enough money for laundry, I have freshly shaved legs, warm sheets, a bowl of garlic and oil pasta, and a Diet Coke. Life is good. Who needs a man?
8979 2018-07-31 02:22:12 idk how i managed to get a free vape and cbd oil but i did
8980 2018-07-31 02:22:06 I LOVE skincare and bath stuff! I have combination skin, so anything for balancing oil is great. Also, stuff for aging >_> #otspsecretsister
8981 2018-07-31 02:22:05 I know. What I meant was: 

Why, as you assert, would the West want to punish the Russian people for the way they handle their own oil & gas? 

Why would that be a concern at all for the West?

8983 2018-07-31 02:22:00 He's drinking the Jonestown punch. You're nothing but a snake oil salesman and always have and will be.
8984 2018-07-31 02:21:49 ..."but they are not working with Chicago police or the mayor's office".
What could possibly go wrong?
8985 2018-07-31 02:21:13 Why support the German taxpayer over the Colorado tax payer. Why should I pay to protect Germans from Russian aggression, when Germany is supplying the bullets to the Russians by buying oil from Russia and not the US? Also, touting agreement with McCain is not a good move either

8987 2018-07-31 02:20:32 I'd also point out that's just my first hand experience, I know it goes back further in other countries too, like the 2nd Gulf war being over non-existent "WMD"s - it was clearly for oil primarily, and to overthrow Saddam second. Not just the British public that fell for that.
8988 2018-07-31 02:20:20 @GraysonDolan did you add oil to to the grill so the kabobs don’t stick? Also @EthanDolan did you eat it?
8989 2018-07-31 02:19:58 that chilli oil looks amazing (:
8990 2018-07-31 02:19:46 Its laughable that May thinks the media is biased towards the oil sector, it’s quite the opposite. It’s more the fact that CDN’s have caught onto the Green Parties lies and half truths.
8991 2018-07-31 02:19:28 Sin and salvation mix about like oil and water

8997 2018-07-31 02:18:30 That's a lot of oil...
8998 2018-07-31 02:18:18 Some of us in the upstream oil sector have been victims, where companies bring workers on a visitors visa to work taking our jobs. You just don’t know shit, you need to ask before tweeting
8999 2018-07-31 02:18:18 That's because Germany is buying oil from Russia.  President Trump is advancing a narrative relating to importing liquid natural gas (LNG) to the EU.  This alone will be crippling to Russia once our massive tariff free LNG exports to the EU start.
9000 2018-07-31 02:18:13 You need some oil brother
9001 2018-07-31 02:18:11 LOL sike nah I’ve been sticking to clay washing and castor oil and shea butter and it’s def much more healthier now. I’m just impatient but the weaves do help

9003 2018-07-31 02:18:07 Crude oil jumps 2.38% on yesterday's trading!

Double trouble for many oil importing countries, including India!

9010 2018-07-31 02:15:55 Oil holds above $70. Not sure how I feel about that...
9011 2018-07-31 02:15:39 If you don’t know how to check your own oil, you probably shouldn’t be behind the wheel of anything street legal

9013 2018-07-31 02:15:09 Precision induction cook top. It's got a pan sensor that sticks out and measures the pan's temp and keeps it the same. It also has a probe that you can stick in water/oil/food to regulate the temp, but as you can see pan control works quite well.

9015 2018-07-31 02:15:02 who knows how to change oil?
9016 2018-07-31 02:14:40 if that happens, ada possibility moisturizer tu tak sesuai. if sesuai it will give more benefit than harm. sya hydrate guna hydrating toner (HL light) + hydrating serum (snail) + moisturizer from neutrogena yang oil free. nak jumpa moisturizer yg sesuai mashaallah susahnya

9021 2018-07-31 02:13:58 Ledger and Trezor never claim things are not hackable.  Selling a false sense of security is snake oil. When there are vulnerabilities exposed by researchers, the hardware wallet vendors in the past work on a patch. (Keepkey, OpenDime, Digital Bitbox are also preferable)
9022 2018-07-31 02:13:51 Oil change for sure Friday
9023 2018-07-31 02:13:50 I liked it! It was fun!
9024 2018-07-31 02:13:21 Oil prices must increase twenty to thirty percent when 2020 IMO rule hits.
diesel refined from Middle East light crude oil, one of the most common crudes, contains 0.53 percent, tension in oil shipping lanes is already occuring.

9045 2018-07-31 02:10:06 Existing customers such as farmers, truckers, railroads, and heavy equipment operators purchase diesel fuel. Quite simply, they will soon compete with all MARINE VESSELS to buy low-sulfur diesel fuel for the first time ever. This will spike oil prices

The Senate just legalized hemp now that we have a President who isn't in the pocket of the oil companies.
Trump is already doing more for the environment than 30 years of liberal whining.

9085 2018-07-31 02:03:49 What is impact to US Auto at $200 Oil
Vehicle sales will plummet, especially those of gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles
(SUVs). One or more major US automakers will face bankruptcy, even closure.
9086 2018-07-31 02:03:43 It’s crazy that I’m like 45$ for a dress? BET but when it’s 45$ for a oil change I’m like how long can I go without that
9087 2018-07-31 02:03:37 That is interesting.  I just dry my basil.  How much basil to Olive Oil do you use?  Do you pack it in the cubes then fill with oil?

9128 2018-07-31 01:55:25 Umm. 45 has already delivered on that w/border kidnappings that are costing millions, robbing from public lands to enrich his oil/gas/mineral buddies, stealing from social programs to further enrich corporations w/ a tax cut, etc.  Dems plan to stop 45s white collar criminals.
9129 2018-07-31 01:55:24 Boil tiny new potatoes for 10 mins, drain them, smash them on a cookie sheet, drown in olive oil, salt, pepper, and cook them at 450 for 20-30mins. 

Good.

9132 2018-07-31 01:55:13 Makes you think how many more are rigging in their favour. Meriton, AMP. Who next. As per Midnight Oil song, “Rich get richer and the poor get the picture”.

9136 2018-07-31 01:54:30 This is so true. I also deal with chronic pain. I hope the CBD oil helps you!
9137 2018-07-31 01:54:26 I don’t hang out in corporate Alberta so I don’t see this! I have family who work oil & gas - they’re working and doing fine! In fact anyone who wants 2 work is working. I see positive/neg reports & good/bad news stories all over I just don’t recognize the horrible province u do!
9138 2018-07-31 01:54:25 わかる。
9139 2018-07-31 01:54:09 The valvoline on hennepin used to be lady-owned. It was all ladies in jumpsuits changing your oil. I miss that.
9140 2018-07-31 01:54:01 Jamaican black castor oil blessed my lashes so much man
9141 2018-07-31 01:53:54 In fact, I just used the advance search for his handle and the dates June 1 to July 1st, 2018, and even with the quality filter off, none of Rob's posts show up.
9142 2018-07-31 01:53:11 Want to know how bad socialism is?
Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves on Earth. Yet it's people are starving because socialism stand between it and prosperity.
9143 2018-07-31 01:53:06 You just gone slap some baby oil on ya face and call it clear huh?
9144 2018-07-31 01:52:31 I need to get some coconut oil for bre’s hair.

9146 2018-07-31 01:52:08 You will probably be fine as long as you watch it, if you’re worried try a nourishing oil or hair mask immediately after!!!
9147 2018-07-31 01:51:39 Here's one for ya, Stu. Ever go in to have an "oil change" to be told it's not time but need to rotate your tires? hmmm
9148 2018-07-31 01:51:23 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
9149 2018-07-31 01:51:23 Them: What does Big Sur mean anyway?

Me: [explains origins] and so ultimately it means Big South

Them: ah ok

Me: like Big Oil

Them: ...
9150 2018-07-31 01:51:06 yes i can see that corporate politicians who profit from oil sales enact legislation that makes solar energy less accessible than it should be. and did i say africa needs to forget about fossil fuels? if the whole world did it, solar would be cheaper
9151 2018-07-31 01:50:46 if we could somehow harness the small dick energy that comes from Pewdiepie’s fanbase we would never have to drill for oil ever again. environmental engineers: GET ON THIS SHIT
9152 2018-07-31 01:50:43 tbh he looks like he uses wet wipes to shower and then lotions up with patchouli oil
9153 2018-07-31 01:50:40 Did my full skin care routine for the first time in months, cleaned my room up some, watered my aloe and succulents, and I’m using my oil diffuser and eating vegan ice cream. I’m trying to love myself again 
9154 2018-07-31 01:50:38 Aaaa I had it up not long ago but it's vanished - You fry small pieces of chicken in corn starch & flour batter first, then drown it in sauce made of gochujang, soy sauce, rice wine (I used mirin), sesame oil, sugar, ginger and garlic
9155 2018-07-31 01:50:26 Trying out aromatherapy.

So far? Body responds to it wonderfully. I can feel my heart rate calm down when I inhale the scent of the oil blend when I'm having a panic attack.

Doesn't really stop my negative thought process but at least its a step in the right direction.
9156 2018-07-31 01:50:13 Rest of the world doesn't have a military budget and leaches of you guys for protection or doesn't have 300m people, or you can be like Noway and pay 50% tax on everything as standard while despite owning/selling vast oil reserves for profit and only a population of 5m people.
9157 2018-07-31 01:49:57 i dont even buy bongs/oil rigs/bubblers anymore, always break em anyways

9160 2018-07-31 01:49:33 Today’s course of action: neti pot, allergy meds, and face steam with peppermint oil... still barely breathing through my nose
9161 2018-07-31 01:49:26 I just made chicken curry. And I put way too much peppermint oil in boiling water to get out the smell. I can hardly breathe.

おめでとうございます
9164 2018-07-31 01:49:18 Thanks so much for the reference! That link isn't working for me though. Will have to scope out e-access for Idiom back issues, there's good oil in there.
9165 2018-07-31 01:48:49 I MISS DOING OIL PAINT PORTRAITS
9166 2018-07-31 01:48:46 It’s not so much the oil people as the Wall Str. people
9167 2018-07-31 01:48:42 Lmao it’s not cuticle oil ?
9168 2018-07-31 01:48:42 The Cinnamon & Cardamom Olive Oil body scrub from Bath & Body Works is sooooooo bomb.. I’m lost for words
9169 2018-07-31 01:48:35 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
9170 2018-07-31 01:48:27 bnyak yg make sih bisa. tp aku pake bio oil
9171 2018-07-31 01:48:22 Guzzling water...cause somewhere deep down inside I believe it’ll fix everything in my life, along with coconut oil.

9173 2018-07-31 01:48:00 @jaglancy said there was no oil or gas in the boat (aside from whatever made it explode, of course) and that the debris was recovered.
9174 2018-07-31 01:47:57 Got the front & rear diff gear oil changed out, did a load of laundry & now gonna try to get a quick run in. Love productive evenings 
9175 2018-07-31 01:47:42 Well, I'll have to now since I've emberessed myself on PA oil history.  I imagine @RobHilliard_66 will now take great pleasure in this...
9176 2018-07-31 01:47:42 They're trying their damnedest to pretend to be all "green" and not at all about oil.
9177 2018-07-31 01:47:35 If Guardian knows how to get oil out of concrete they have a billion dollar product/process...ASSHOLES there is a difference between negligence and just automobiles being automobiles ya know.

9180 2018-07-31 01:47:01 @Bamabroker  what’s ur view on oil
9181 2018-07-31 01:46:45 A drop of olive oil rubbed nightly into your nails will help them grow long and strong, and is cheaper than shop-bought manicure oils.
9182 2018-07-31 01:46:41 pake bio oil
9183 2018-07-31 01:46:34 I have some olive oil that has some bits of dried Anaheim pepper swilling around in it for a few weeks now, would that add anything? I was experimenting with my plant for the most part cuz the pepper grows on my patio lol
9184 2018-07-31 01:46:33 I love to eat them raw, but I've discovered that a light sauté in olive oil really brings out the full flavour. If I can save a few I'll be making chutney. #gardenchat
9185 2018-07-31 01:46:31 @kyledunnigan your Instagram is bananas...so good, Mike would eat em for breakfast...but it would mess with the motor oil running through his veins.  #mike4president #cars #usedcarmike
9186 2018-07-31 01:46:29 My brother was using one of those e-whatevs the last few months cuz he trying to quit smoking. Saw him over the weekend with a pack of Kools.
Me: sooo what's going on?
Him: I don't wanna use all my oil in the other thing, and I can sell singles.
How do you help a fool?
9187 2018-07-31 01:46:03 Use Mink Oil, Leather Cream or All Natural Leather Conditioner.

9196 2018-07-31 01:45:08 People really need to grasp and understand the concept of moisturizing. Just rub a pinch sized amount of coconut oil or shea butter on your face before you sleep. The next morning your skin will be on 1,000

9203 2018-07-31 01:44:16 Audio Jackass Crew is at it again, changing their fucking oil with a flashlight just now. In the damn parking lot. The property is NOT your fucking collective garage, fellas.  #renterhell #MotorWeekRejects
9204 2018-07-31 01:44:06 Sanctions against Iran is an impasse, a long way off from something Trump could claim as a victory. Worse, they threaten to send crude prices spiralling up again, and the blame will be on Trump's doorstep. So not surprising for him to make these "overtures". #oil #Iran #OOTT
9205 2018-07-31 01:44:05 Moisturize, either Cantu or pure coconut oil, also Creme of nature Argon leave in conditioner is amazing ! Braid it at night before wrapping it to hold the moisture, hope it's a good tip for you 
9206 2018-07-31 01:44:01 That’s how they drain the oil off them sometimes lol
9207 2018-07-31 01:43:59 "The grooviest and nastiest things in the world cannot be ingested or even pursued - they must be washed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
9208 2018-07-31 01:43:40 Depending on the type of meat product… You can increase its overall volume by 5 to 15% by letting it soak in oil for a few hours or overnight… More for less! (Also juicier and more flavorful depending on oil and flavorings mixed into it)
9209 2018-07-31 01:43:36 Canned tuna + olive oil + chopped onions + pickled bananna papers or oilves + salt and peppers
9210 2018-07-31 01:43:32 Lavender/peppermint essential oil.
9211 2018-07-31 01:43:23 Looks like an amazing place Oil Kann. What kind of shoes are those that you are wearing? Sneaker head here.
9212 2018-07-31 01:43:21 I’d say it’s important to note that if one isn’t immediately adding them to sauce or into the final dish, then a quick rinse with cold water to shed some exterior starches and tossing with a bit of oil is mandatory.  #NobodyLikesPastaClumps
9213 2018-07-31 01:43:20 If you took a drink from Christ in you every time you saw sin and wrongdoing in the world guess what? You'd be the drunkest most anointed cup overflowing with wine and oil Christian in the world! 
9214 2018-07-31 01:43:13 You said and it is falling on deaf ears, this government is really ruining this country by denying our oil industry the Energy east pipeline, it alone would contribute a huge amount of cash flow and jobs for this country and we could have everything a country need, JT sucks
9215 2018-07-31 01:43:12 Can't pull too much out. Would drop prices. Oil people don 't care much for dropping oil prices.
9216 2018-07-31 01:43:08 Allow this govt to deal with other govt for joint exploration project for oil & fuel sa WPS at Phil. Rise...there is a possibility hindi na maghihirap ang Pilipinas. Let us start now & chart it for the next 3 years.
9217 2018-07-31 01:43:02 Oo basta lemon juice! May antioxidant si lemon na nagsloslow down ng browning para di masira sjdjf mash mo lang avocado, dice tomatoes, add mangoes or onions, salt and pepper tapos chili oil!!
9218 2018-07-31 01:42:53 yeah 70/30-80/20 is pretty good. you really do need the fat content for flavor. also when cooking it in a cast like i do it acts as a natural lubricant to on the pan so you don’t have to use canola or vegetable oil (shit greasy for real)

9225 2018-07-31 01:41:45 Oil is King. Gold buys it. Everything else is credit.
9226 2018-07-31 01:41:28 Was REDA one of the paybacks for contribution to the Tapcal Trust Fund? @OilGasCanada Making AER immune makes the regulator above the law. Redwater decision makes us the final payers of environmental liabilities that oil industry can walk away from by bankruptcy.  We pay for all.
9227 2018-07-31 01:41:18 I bought mayo made with oilive oil. I hope it's not gonna be too spicy 
9228 2018-07-31 01:41:07 She's terrific. I discovered her in a small role in Lorenzo's Oil. She stole the season she was featured in in Justified. Same w The Americans. Fabulous actor.
9229 2018-07-31 01:41:07 jack is attempting to perform an oil change by draining the oil from the lug nuts...
9230 2018-07-31 01:40:57 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that
9231 2018-07-31 01:40:54 But on another note, whoever said “fighting oil with oil” is true! I mean your skin will still be oily but not to the same extent. Just remember that when you’re older your skin will still look good than people who have dry skin
9232 2018-07-31 01:40:35 子猫なら…あっやっぱ無理っ(逃
9233 2018-07-31 01:40:29 Thanks Rhonda! Do you have any recommendations for omega 3 supplements to give kids? Can’t give a toddler a giant fish oil pill....
9234 2018-07-31 01:40:25 Let me tell you something... listen closely.... lavender essential oil in your nightly shower. It’s fucking magical.
9235 2018-07-31 01:40:20 Ngga salah jugasih ma hahaha, tp aku pakenya cleansing oil sih biar lebih nendang
9236 2018-07-31 01:40:15 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
9237 2018-07-31 01:40:07 I found the strawberry lemonade flavor profile is the most enjoyable to me, for CBD oil.
9238 2018-07-31 01:39:59 Because sometimes creams can be too heavy for your skin causing your pores to get clogged. Also if your skin is oily and you use a cream with oil it can make things worse.
9239 2018-07-31 01:39:50 “I tell ya, man, sometimes, I wonder what it’ll take for me to dissolve into an oil painting of victory. Rocky did it. Apollo Creed did it. Why not Jon Gruden, man? Why not Jon Gruden.” 

“...sir this isn’t actually Carl Weathers inside this paint...”

“Shhhhh...”
9240 2018-07-31 01:39:48 We will look into that! ...in the meantime we have a matcha limeade on tap that will rock your socks off (pro tip: add CBD oil for extra chill)
9241 2018-07-31 01:39:48 I can't wait to grind for even more mats.

It's like, what, ores and oil and concrete right
9242 2018-07-31 01:39:14 I use Cured Nutrition CBD oil.
9243 2018-07-31 01:39:13 - Deodorant 
- Breath mint or gums,if 
permitted 
- Perfume , cologne or
body spray 
- Face wipes or oil pads 
-  Hand sanitizer or hand lotion
- A toothbrush or some toothpicks 
- Chapstick 
- Pads
9244 2018-07-31 01:39:07 I would run everything on solar and oil.
9245 2018-07-31 01:39:00 Big Oil Should Definitely Pay Their Share For Climate Change!!!
9246 2018-07-31 01:38:39 praying for money, big no-no! prayers to stop oil spills maybe?
9247 2018-07-31 01:38:05 Are you serious? You really got your snake oil out tonight! Look at you, with your Flimflam ways thinking that anyone will believe this garbage! Sadly if they do, they’re most likely a con-artist like yourself or another who I wish one day will see all this BS for what it is ...
9248 2018-07-31 01:37:43 You cant mix water and oil hoo
9249 2018-07-31 01:37:33 Ummmm, South AND North Dakota?!?!  Oil can't buy happiness, I'll take our Colorado #1 anyday!
9250 2018-07-31 01:36:46 One time I put actual coconut oil in my hair (amazing) so now anytime I do a hair mask my dog tastes it. If it’s bad he just leaves his tongue out til I wipe it off.
9251 2018-07-31 01:36:45 someone come oil my scalp
9252 2018-07-31 01:36:40 社交辞令が上手いことw
9253 2018-07-31 01:36:13 Pain stops you from moving to your task directly. You have to get creative with how you are going to do what you need to do. Plus realize you now have limitations and it’s ok to ask for help. Hope the CBD oil helps.
9254 2018-07-31 01:35:14 I don't know what is wrong but God does and we ask Him to grace Hanna with His healing touch. To fill her with His abiding peace and His strength to wake up. Bless her family with rest and endurance in this race they would rather not run. Father pour Your healing oil over all
9255 2018-07-31 01:35:11 I have been using the oil kind that comes with a dropper and I put drops under my tongue twice a day/as needed. I used to be on medication and have been off of it for a year now. CBD oil has been amazing!! It’s just as good as meds IMO.
9256 2018-07-31 01:35:04 That's even worse, like looking at a minute chart trying to position trade crude oil.
9257 2018-07-31 01:34:39 I be on that oil and my niggas on that medical

9259 2018-07-31 01:34:36 I use lavender oil . I have a bottle with me wherever I go. I put some on my pillow when I sleep. I have a song called “you’ll be ok” by Great Big World. It’s empowering when I’m having a panic attack and reassures me that I’ll be just fine. Having a great support system is key
9260 2018-07-31 01:34:36 who uses cbd oil and essential oils they works wonderful with pain hit me up for orders

9262 2018-07-31 01:34:02 Trade wars are a cute excuse to raise prices.  Its the same B.S. when oil/gas prices up.  It gives suppliers carte blanc to raise prices way above whatever the actual operating increases are.  E.g, transpo costs may make up 1% of the cost of a product but prices increase 25%.
9263 2018-07-31 01:34:01 i’m still not used to the way this lavender tea tree oil smells but it does wonders
9264 2018-07-31 01:33:46 CBD oil is good stuff. I use it for my anxiety and lower back. It comes in a ton of different forms. Creams that are like icy hot. Butters. Oils. Candy like sour belts. Smokable (in disposable pen form). Please let me know if either of you need recommendations.
9265 2018-07-31 01:33:42 Ah :( rede social ruim
9266 2018-07-31 01:33:30 No, I’m hoping to get some this week! Do you suggest the oil, edibles, vape?
9267 2018-07-31 01:33:27 Bruh these train tracks need some oil on them. This shit loud af
9268 2018-07-31 01:33:24 Moloch whose love is endless oil and stone! Moloch whose soul is electricity and banks! Moloch whose poverty is the specter of genius! Moloch whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen! Moloch whose name is the Mind!
9269 2018-07-31 01:33:22 Sanctions may have accelerated the death spiral, but there is really no economy to save. Iran is more dependent than ever to oil revenue, hasn't been able to attract any foreign direct investment competitively. Blows away its revenues on ideological causes, terrorists and proxies
9270 2018-07-31 01:33:16 I set a beer on one of my skull coasters to light some incense and oil diffusers. And a thought crossed my mind: 

If this were the 1600s, I’d probably be accused of witchcraft.
9271 2018-07-31 01:33:06 My guess is he could’ve been an offshore workman. Those oil companies tend to fly their employees in First/Biz if traveling internationally.  I’m off that flight so I don’t care who he was now lol #DL2426
9272 2018-07-31 01:32:45 Your 1st question is invalid. Nigeria does not need to sell like a hustler mindset. The question should be, what is the attraction after oil? Never mind the fact that pastor VP already gave away our big data to goog.

9274 2018-07-31 01:32:29 US can let Saudi & Iran deal with each other without direct involvement & getting a bad name & dirtying it's hands. US is already doing intelligence sharing. Only role I will suggest is to police the shipping lines so that oil supplies don't stop. Iran can't attack U.S. navy.
9275 2018-07-31 01:32:23 I been on a oil burning kick lately  however the vibe that candles give off is undefeated
9276 2018-07-31 01:32:08 Ever go to get a oil change and buy a new car instead??
9277 2018-07-31 01:31:59 @emilychangtv Please stop criticising @elonmusk . Is it cause he called you out on factual innacuracies in your book? Building a car company from scratch, building the future ..disrupting the powerful oil industry, is nothing short of genius and excellence in execution. Sit down.
9278 2018-07-31 01:31:47 Ewww … pretty harsh for a typo!  I could understand it if it was a widower working on a oil rig with seven kids, looking for love who made a typo but …. harsh!

9329 2018-07-31 01:24:53 @deletethispod @hankgreen I have a theory about your quality fast food workers: they're getting paid a living wage because they are competing with the oil industry in MT? I used to work at McDonalds and I met someone who worked in an MT location and they paid way more cuz of that

9368 2018-07-31 01:19:53 Yup! People like avocado oil for that too, or even coconut oil. But I've never really used either one. Canola and veg oil have the added perk of not really tasting like anything.
9369 2018-07-31 01:19:40 Well, it does say "raw chicken." Not a meal I would ever serve. I can come up with something edible in that same time frame: cesar salad, poached salmon, steamed asparagus, al dente pasta w/olive oil and parmesan.  Keeper wife.

9378 2018-07-31 01:18:17 Olive oil also burns at a lower temp too. So if you stir fry with it at a high temp it can taste burnt and have a weird bitter taste.

9382 2018-07-31 01:17:58 Thanks meiC! The main thing im watching now in oil is a rising channel from ~july 23rd and resistance is up in the 70.60-70.70 area so i wouldnt say it broke out till it clears there.
9383 2018-07-31 01:17:50 Whatever "big oil" would be forced to pay will be passed onto us via price increases at the pump. So, "we" pay.
9384 2018-07-31 01:17:35 Yeah definitely. And olive oil and sesame oil are often conflicting flavor wise. Especially in a wok where you're probably cooking at a high temp, go with canola or veg oil to actually stir fry. Then add a little sesame oil near the end.
9385 2018-07-31 01:17:29 Make sure you can be online the following dates for night time hangs (the following are shows I owe from our mfc share goals):
Thurs Aug 2nd - Ice and Lotion show
Tues Aug 7th - Oil show
Thurs Aug 9th - Blacklight and shower show
Mon Aug 20th - Body Paint show
Dates may change*
9386 2018-07-31 01:17:02 It’s a stronger flavor but it’s good. Definitely gotta Get use to it and find what you like with it. I like it with rice, veggies, and meats but the seasoning has to match the oil.
9387 2018-07-31 01:17:02 No question but I do think it'll be a tougher sell to the greater fan base in Houston then it would've been a couple of years back. People are outraged far quicker these days and that's a good thing.

9392 2018-07-31 01:16:30 Just *seeing* someone on the TL suggest using coconut oil on your face makes me break out  y’all don’t love yourselves enough
9393 2018-07-31 01:16:29 It’s usually best as a finishing oil and not a cooking oil as it has a very low burning point...

9397 2018-07-31 01:15:42 It's very strong. And it burns at a low temp. So you can't really "cook" with it like you can canola or vegetable oil. Definitely add some to fried rice or stir fry. But more often added as a finishing thing.
9398 2018-07-31 01:15:35 Yes, I have. Although I prefer truffle flavored olive oil. Sesame oil is like canola.

9405 2018-07-31 01:14:20 THANK. YOU. All these natural skin/makeup brands give me the worst breakouts because they’re so hot for coconut oil. A boy would like to cover his acne scars organically w/o getting more breakouts.

9407 2018-07-31 01:14:09 @SamHarrisOrg I am reading Waking Up. I have a terminal Brain Tumor. I am using spices from the East. Turmeric, Garlic, Ginger, Cayenne Pepper, Black Seed Oil. My prognosis was 14 months in 2013. I am one of 5 % to live this long. Western medicine is wrong
9408 2018-07-31 01:14:06 Efficascent relaxing oil. Hahaha
9409 2018-07-31 01:14:03 But beta this coward govt is habituated to apply oil in OILY HAIR.
9410 2018-07-31 01:13:42 Alright ma'am. I do suggest you do yellow garri instead. The process of its production aids in the removal of certain substances especially with the addition of the palm oil. Stick to yellow garri

9414 2018-07-31 01:12:49 I have a mechanic / garage that changes my oil for less then I can buy oil for. I watch from afar. All you have to do is pull the dip stick if you are not sure. New oil should be almost clear not dark.
9415 2018-07-31 01:12:45 Don't question me, just respect thst I need a place to store this list of things I need without judgement:

Apple cider vinegar.
Aloe Vera gel.
Coconut oil.
Syringe.
9416 2018-07-31 01:12:13 Yup. It’s basically just ground up peanuts, no sugar. You have to stir it up when you open a new jar because the oil separates out.
9417 2018-07-31 01:12:06 Apparently, we spend a lot of tax money on directly subsidizing the oil industry. Why don't we use that money on health prevention? Studies have found investments in prevention have saved society $3 to $11 for each dollar spent. #cdnpoli #onpoli
9418 2018-07-31 01:12:03 Lots of onshore energy will collapse Mideast and Venezuelan prices. Then the other oil producers can play their price games.

9452 2018-07-31 01:07:16 It’s why China has made its way into the Pacific, it appears Australia has forgottten its neighbours and if my memory serves me well there was a problem the LNP/Downer created when negotiating the oil reserves/ boundaries?

9454 2018-07-31 01:07:11 look beyond this mere 12 billion, the Oil Depletion Allowance provide more socialistic support to the extraction industries and logging.
9455 2018-07-31 01:07:10 BRK isn’t a traditional oil producer but rather an oil land developer emulating the model Chesapeake Energy laid out 

They just doubled their money on some oil land they bought 2yrs ago

They need to do more of these sales to show the market the increase in value of their land

9463 2018-07-31 01:06:36 That is not a trade war (oil), that is consumption. Consumption is driving refined reserves down. High side the Saudi's and W. Texas are pumping more crude. Texas is now bigger than Iran and Iraq in production.
9464 2018-07-31 01:06:29 Oh yes I dah baca few tadi which the reason it’s not good sebab oil yg hilang akan diganti dgn oil yg lagi banyak. Ada yg kata boleh pakai utk masa tertentu but kalau nak wipe sepanjang masa and bergantung pd oil sheet ni, tak sihat. Thank you

9471 2018-07-31 01:05:08 Do gas prices often go DOWN when oil prices do? Sometimes, a little, but not reflective of the depth of the price drop. Once prices rise on anything, for any reason, companies rarely pull prices back.

9480 2018-07-31 01:03:12 That gets lost in Trump's wide spread, multi country trade war.  All consumers will be paying higher prices on a lot of goods, not just food. Heating oil is back up to the prices we saw when Bush was in office. Last year I paid $1.95, today it's $2.95. Gas prices too.

9543 2018-07-31 00:54:08 What’s wrong with In n Out? I’ve had it, it was good for a better than regular fast food burger. And tbh I liked their fries better than 5 guys bc I don’t like a gallon of oil on every fry.

9550 2018-07-31 00:53:07 Vegetable oil gets that stuff off. Srsly, it works. Too late for that birb, I'm afraid but next time try the veggie oil/corn oil/peanut. I imagine olive oil would work too. I rescued a bat caught on a sticky mouse trap, rehabbed it for a year and it flew away. Bats rock.

9555 2018-07-31 00:52:48 Its the same thing as an oil change. A teaser to get you in and up sell you everything else.
9556 2018-07-31 00:52:45 @allinwithchris Thank you for talking about climate change!  Do it more!  Existential, immediate threat to human civilization.  Trump admin actively endangering the world. Oil industry,  Kochs etc must be held accountable!

9558 2018-07-31 00:52:09 I use CBD oil and the things it helps with are amazing.
9559 2018-07-31 00:51:36 I wonder if they put oil on themselves before they started frying.
9560 2018-07-31 00:51:30 Nobody wants motor oil at the bottom of their bag
9561 2018-07-31 00:51:25 I pour some of the oil out, then stir. Better peanut flavor 
9562 2018-07-31 00:51:15 LMAAAO has you tried kiehl dark spot treatment HAHA bio oil works too tho
9563 2018-07-31 00:51:11 Explain KM killing me 1000's of rail cars rolling across the country is more probable of catastrophic oil spill than oil being pumped thru a stationary pipeline. Unless some terrorists blow it up. But only conservatives believe in KM/TERRORISM in Canada. Libs...
9564 2018-07-31 00:51:10 Putin ends this, btw. U.S. chaos and crisis are perfect for him. 
If he really just wanted oil deals, he would have laid low. 
He's cranking up the heat on Trump and the GOP 
with his requests for meetings. 
There will be a full blown Const. crisis &  Putin triggers it.

9567 2018-07-31 00:50:41 Laughs in record oil production which is the 1st thing a Russian puppet would crack down on.
9568 2018-07-31 00:50:40 I get that you use oil cleanser but I read stride x pads? Is that over the oil? Then I just let it sit and then rinse? This could save me a trip to get a facial lol

9575 2018-07-31 00:49:34 Alternating aloe vera & coconut oil after this weekend.. I’m staying out of the sun for the rest of summer 
9576 2018-07-31 00:49:18 Great advice. 

Plot the spot return vs the futures return and they are very different historically.  Convenience yield carry is big in commodities, I think its the only asset where arbitrage exists? (albeit, with a high barrier...eg, u need to rent a tanker to store oil lol)

9583 2018-07-31 00:48:20 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Doritos is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Raleigh sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
9584 2018-07-31 00:47:54 Um, your thinking is like shaming MDs because people spend so much time watching TV medical dramas - Obviously they are seeking out non traditional care! Humans love snake oil. Always have. Goop is cynical shameless pandering to new age neo religious desire for faith healing
9585 2018-07-31 00:47:45 Advice of the day: Instead of using Vaseline, lotion or if you're a fucking caveman, oil, to jerk off, try using Vicks. Your welcome world.

9592 2018-07-31 00:46:55 So you don't think we were importing oil for about 40 years until fracking took off 10 years ago? How about lithium for all our new battery technology? Where does that come from? Idiot.

9594 2018-07-31 00:46:50 @Oil_Drop To me, the trade makes sense for Houston, depending on the final legal ruling. The Astros need a top reliever. If Osuna is fit and focused, he's one of the best young firemen in the game.

9601 2018-07-31 00:44:49 I’ve checked the oil filter after the fact stu and they haven’t and I brought it back and pointed it out to them. Since I marked it prior and took a picture of it, they were like oh gee oops, so I do my own from now on. And bring the used oil down to AutoZone.
9602 2018-07-31 00:44:17 I'd just our beaches, too, w/ all the oil covered aquatic life doin crack in front of the kids.

9605 2018-07-31 00:43:52 The odometer on my car started running backwards. Very confusing for the guys who do the oil changes.
9606 2018-07-31 00:43:31 (oil made all the plastic in ur cool snarky phone btw)
9607 2018-07-31 00:43:29 Already did. If you want to believe that there's something in the Constitution that says "bailout Wall St banks and subsidize oil companies", feel free.
9608 2018-07-31 00:43:11 Why is Canada importing crude oil from USA? 
9609 2018-07-31 00:43:10 Are my live broadcasts really THAT boring?
I have a plan to get us off of foreign oil, and reduce automobile emissions significantly in only 2 years. Those interested please inquire.

9623 2018-07-31 00:41:20 Nooo Lol its a common abbreviation but you’d have to know. Like people also use EVOO for extra virgin olive oil in skin care forums a lot which I had to learn what it stood for lol

9648 2018-07-31 00:38:37 Danny banked on oil paying for all the sins of overruns and we’d be none the wiser!

9650 2018-07-31 00:38:15 This prob isn’t the best but it works for my hair & it’s quick at home mix honey and some sort of oil. I use coconut. Then melt and mix. If you want add some conditioner and mix. Apply it to your damp hair. Leave it for a while and comb thru then wash with shampoo!
9651 2018-07-31 00:38:01 Lol the shampoo i just got her has Argan oil, lavender, and shea butter. And she had the nerve to not like it. A TJ Maxx original. Smh. Just ungrateful

9659 2018-07-31 00:36:28 article that says "minimal effort recipes that take less than 15 minutes!": simmer chicken breast in truffle oil, add arugula, norwegian goat cheese, and dijon foamed catsup. take out of pan and assemble to look like gordon ramsay himself was in the kitchen with you
9660 2018-07-31 00:36:18 I got really interested in doing OCM in like 2011 or so I’d say maybe even earlier but couldn’t fully commit to it. I do have the dhc oil tho still maybe I’ll try again
9661 2018-07-31 00:36:16 The Liberal government has hurt the oil industry and Canadians have lost a lot of revenue that would have helped healthcare and our infrastructure.
9662 2018-07-31 00:36:08 Who gave Jamie Oliver the power to ruin stuff? The man pisses olive oil but he can just change your diet at will. If I could afford Coco Pops I’d be so mad

9668 2018-07-31 00:35:04 Sadly no, I can’t afford it. Ive been taking cbd oil to ease them. It has helped a ton, but for some reason today there as been multiple more than usual
9669 2018-07-31 00:35:04 Hi, mind asking. Jadi ke pakai coconut oil? Boleh cuci sunscreen sekali?
9670 2018-07-31 00:34:37 Depends on the industry. But if you're in oil & gas industry bidding for national oil company projects, the usual requirements for engineers must be registered with BEM.

9679 2018-07-31 00:32:42 Yesss! I used to mark an x on my oil filter with a sharpee! That way I'd know for sure! 
9680 2018-07-31 00:32:36 Gotta love living where I can smell the suntan oil from the beach in the breeze a mile away at Cbad State Beach.
9681 2018-07-31 00:32:21 Ok you take a can of coffee, doesn't really matter what kind. Empty it out into a large mixing bowl, add 2 cups of extra virgin olive oil, 3 tablespoons of honey, 2 tablespoons of cinnamon and mix it all together until it's a paste like consistency and your ready to go.
9682 2018-07-31 00:32:17 It’s cheaper to buy what you need to do it yourself than to pay for a whole oil change

9690 2018-07-31 00:31:10 You absolutely do. As a small business owner and oil trader that makes you a capitalist at heart.

Reducing taxes and helping those of us who own small business is what Trump is about. With Trump - 12% business tax decrease.

Under Obama’s agenda I was taking it in the shorts!
9691 2018-07-31 00:31:06 A lot good that will do if one of those foreign oil tankers spring a leak.
9692 2018-07-31 00:31:03 so, jim, you think oil is the future?
9693 2018-07-31 00:30:58 It’s fair when the oil workers get layed off, when auto makers lose their jobs, when small businesses have to close, mom & pop shops close! SHUT UP  & roll with it!
9694 2018-07-31 00:30:52 It is such a wonderful oil!

9703 2018-07-31 00:29:32 It’s 1973. Robert DeNiro looks wistfully up at the Genco Olive Oil sign being painted by the art department. He’s shooting the second Godfather movie. “One day,” he sighs longingly, “I will meet the Fockers.”
9704 2018-07-31 00:29:27 What?! I liked that tweet earlier with no problem. Must’ve been gaining steam or something that triggered the artificial intelligence over at Twitter.

9708 2018-07-31 00:28:45 Still remember my first time showering with soft water at a hotel during a soccer tournament as a kid. I thought my friends were playing a prank and had replaced my shampoo with cooking oil or something. I was happy to find out that everyone thought they’d been pranked.

9710 2018-07-31 00:28:13 I've always referred to the snake oil sellers as Brexiteers (OK sometimes Quitlings) and those who meekly fell for the patter - Leavers.
You have to appreciate that for many it was simply an act of rebellion — sticking it to that man Cameron.

9714 2018-07-31 00:27:52 omg this is kinda gross but I tried that oil cleansing method to get “grit”(?) out of your pores and it worked and there was all this gritty black stuff coming out of my PORES
9715 2018-07-31 00:27:43 I know a lot of people (including my wife!) love f.lux. And I gotta admit I’m a total hypocrite for saying it (I fell hard for the WakeMate). But I kinda think apps inspired by neuroscience papers are almost all snake oil. And definitely the “make my screen sort of orange” ones.
9716 2018-07-31 00:27:42 Same here. I had lived there for 2 1/2 decades. In that time, I've encountered gooey, dark brown tar balls that washed up from the Gulf. WEAR TV local talking heads were told that it was a natural phenom. The stuff had that odor I've detected around crude oil pumps & wells.

9731 2018-07-31 00:25:25 This shit right here. This is why I get butthurt over art. 11 year old oil paintings. I'm 30+ and my fuckin stickfigures have one arm longer than the other.

You've seen the TV ads.
9736 2018-07-31 00:24:37 I missed that part actually, be it as it may, you still havent answered the question. BTW I believe big oil is interstate commerce. I could be wrong. show me proof that GW bailed out wall street.
9737 2018-07-31 00:24:22 The same economic nonsense peddled by Kudlow and other snake oil salesmen. George HW had a name for it. Do you remember what that was?
9738 2018-07-31 00:23:35 I’ll take some of that oil

9749 2018-07-31 00:22:11 Mike's a joke. lol 

"Hey. Wanna buy my snake oil erection water?"
9750 2018-07-31 00:21:52 You know why they embraced it? OIL. 
When oil was discovered in commercial quantities they knew that they could no longer canvass for a federation and risk the South leaving the North behind.
This only happened under Gowon though, not under Ironsi.

9754 2018-07-31 00:21:17 Don’t they always?
9755 2018-07-31 00:21:07 Of course they arent going to mention oil in the AUMF. Don't be dense. You're better than that.

It's common knowledge at this point that we are still in Iraq and other countries to this day because it makes money for offense contractors.

9759 2018-07-31 00:20:47 Venezuela is falling apart because of the collapse of oil prices. A large chunk of the social safety net was refunded by oil revenue, so when prices cratered, the government Made drastic cuts.

Remember, when oil prices were almost $200/barrel, Venezuela had a powerhouse economy.

You do that know what hard work is, people die in the sun and heat from ACTUAL overworking. You get OVERWHELMED.

9769 2018-07-31 00:19:00 I'm waiting like the ten virgins in the Bible with my lamp and oil,  so your akonta and read songs of Solomon for me 
9770 2018-07-31 00:18:26 Its NOT possible to have a better world? as long as there is never ending war!, oil coal and fracking pollution, nuclear bombs and power plants and extreme greed by the rich and corporations!
9771 2018-07-31 00:18:26 my Aztec clay mask experience for my hair and face was heavenly so glad I bought this stuff. I also mixed a lil bit of witch hazel and black castor oil with the apple cider vinegar and clay mixture!
9772 2018-07-31 00:18:18 We could also fix the problems with fracking if we rounded up South Park fans and ground them up for oil, but I somehow think they'd object to that.
9773 2018-07-31 00:17:26 I've changed my mind on oil. This could be going sideways for some time. $UWT $UCO $SCO $OIL $USO $SCO $DTO $DWT
9774 2018-07-31 00:17:24 people use the words differently.  Venezuela is messed up due primarily to usa meddling, and having an oil based economy when oil went down.

9777 2018-07-31 00:17:06 With crude price inching to $70 plus per barrel.Petrol and diesel prices will moveup and will add to inflation.Expect market to correct and if  oil prices keep going up then sensex can fall 5-10% in next few weeks. It is advisable to sell stocks and hold cash
9778 2018-07-31 00:16:45 So if @OilsandsAction is concerned about human rights, does that mean they think we should stop the building of the TMPL? As that oil is destined for China, and I'm pretty sure they dont have a great human rights record. On top of the fact that it will be exporting CDN jobs.

9794 2018-07-31 00:13:34 Y'know, I volunteered at a wildlife care center for a while.  And one of the things that stuck in my brain was a description of what happens when a bird is covered in oil.  It tries to preen and the oil winds up lining its intestinal tract, keeping it from absorbing water.
9795 2018-07-31 00:13:15 I'm betting you're right.
9796 2018-07-31 00:13:11 3 to 1 ratio of EV olive oil to Apple Cider Vinegar.  Touch of grainy Dijon.  Sea salt.  Shake like it owes you money.  Done!

Run him a nice hot bath (put some Lavender oil and Camomile tea bags in the water and bubbles).
Play the playlist. Light candles.
Rub oil in his scalp while he soaks.

9817 2018-07-31 00:09:28 @POTUS good man saying he will meet Iran's Rouhani - would love to see the reaction of the Saudis. Catalyst to go short oil - Trump changing stance on oil price, Mid-terms around the corner, $3 a gallon creates problems for many. Long-run good for Arabs as will learn to read.
9818 2018-07-31 00:09:15 "Ladies and gentlemen... MY name, is (snake) Oil Salesman!" #Raw
9819 2018-07-31 00:09:11 This new face oil got my skin 
9820 2018-07-31 00:09:06 What a wast of money why not use coconut oil every nite it make your skin beautiful
9821 2018-07-31 00:09:03 ppl really smear coconut oil on their face, go outside & stand in the sun just to post a pic with the caption “that glow tho.” honey your skin is suffering right now
9822 2018-07-31 00:08:57 Oh for God's sakes,  you have got to be shitting me with this.
9823 2018-07-31 00:08:53 drinking olive oil is one of the most disgusting things lol
9824 2018-07-31 00:08:44 Thanks for your valuable charts and take on. It's interesting to hear your opinion about $OIL since it broke out today, didn't it? TIA!
9825 2018-07-31 00:08:44 Acá tienen a otro que quiere lavarse las manos poco a poco del desastre que ha hecho el régimen en nuestro país. @NicmerEvans @ibepacheco @oil_garca
9826 2018-07-31 00:08:34 Want to hear a story?
Rav4 turned over early December.
Car been parked since then over a friend's place
Guy said he started the car no problems, just a little rough since oil was all over the place
9827 2018-07-31 00:08:31 Got an oil change and then my car got a flat tire LOL
9828 2018-07-31 00:08:16 Moreover, the car is mechanical and not animal powered. We see the engine when Barney is building it, the car uses oil, and as evidenced by the clip you can hear the mechanical whir of the internal combustion engine.

Ergo, it is not ridiculous for Shrek to have a camera.
9829 2018-07-31 00:08:12 I use a mixture of baking soda/coconut oil and essential oil more cocnut oil than baking soda my enamel seems to be fine
9830 2018-07-31 00:08:04 What if the miracle of Hanukkah was just a guy who really underestimated how much lamp oil they had?
9831 2018-07-31 00:08:02 Look like way to much housin got put in and not enough chilli oil... killing the favors bro..
9832 2018-07-31 00:07:39 I completely forgot about the Shea butters and coconut oil that has been in my car since I moved out... everything is liquified. I’m sick.
9833 2018-07-31 00:07:33 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
9834 2018-07-31 00:07:25 the @wwe needs to market their own brand of hair oil .... #RAWMiami
9835 2018-07-31 00:07:24 Coconut oil
9836 2018-07-31 00:06:57 *gets FaceTime call while I’m showering*

“Why is your face black were you wearing mascara?”

“No, this is grease and oil falling off my face”

Life of a mechanic #WrenchLife
9837 2018-07-31 00:06:36 J is going through the Midnight Oil catalogue and suddenly I’m in 1993 again and I’m loving it
9838 2018-07-31 00:06:33 Grapes must be crushed to make wine.
Diamonds are formed under pressure.
Olives must be pressed to release oil.
Seeds grow in the dark.
Every time you feel crushed, under pressure, pressed, or in the dark, remember that you are in a powerful place of TRANSFORMATION.
9839 2018-07-31 00:06:28 We here can vouch for just how dangerous this is - as can so many other countries. This breaks my heart because I am planning to move there in 2019.  From the frying pan into boiling oil (or, something like that). So disheartening.
9840 2018-07-31 00:06:26 お金を得るためのお金が無い
9841 2018-07-31 00:06:13 Data is the new Oil.
9842 2018-07-31 00:06:04 wild growth oil has such a strong smell
9843 2018-07-31 00:06:04 “The only essential oil I need is bacon grease” -Dad
I don’t understand...
9844 2018-07-31 00:06:03 Y’all know pretty girl privilege stills exists I’m On FT  with my mama getting my oil changed & Tires rotates& balanced whatever & the man who was doing the stuff tried to talk to me.blah blah long story short  I didn’t pay nothing Bc i promised him I’ll let him  take me out
9845 2018-07-31 00:06:02 Correct.
9846 2018-07-31 00:05:59 Who plays the role of 'Team Oil Boy' on his team?
9847 2018-07-31 00:05:53 Tfw you have your first glass of Pinot noir in a month (20 oz pour? ) + you ask hubby to set up diffuser ((which means 1/4 bottle of therapeutic grade lavender essential oil is used)) >>>>> night niiiiiight
9848 2018-07-31 00:05:26 Where's the part in the Constitution that says the government is required to give big oil companies and Wall Street banks bailouts and subsidies, I'll wait.
9849 2018-07-31 00:05:22 Things more important than the Universal title:

*Roman's hair oil

*Coachman's word of the day

9850 2018-07-31 00:05:07 Alan will. Isn’t he still seeking a “oil change”?
9851 2018-07-31 00:04:49 @realDonaldTrump—DO WE FORGET—TRUMP Stopped Trans gender in MILITARY—NO OIL from IRAN—Eliminate Obamacare MANDATE—EPA REFORM—JERUSALEM Capital of ISRAEL— just a few things WE might have FORGOTTEN ! Only natural,cause TRUMP has done soooo many GREAT THINGS !VOTE REPUB IN NOV-plzRT
9852 2018-07-31 00:04:48 weed oil just sleepy potion
9853 2018-07-31 00:04:43 Oh man. <3 That photo of Luke and Leia needs to be put on canvas in to an oil painting.
9854 2018-07-31 00:04:40 $200 oil would make #Argentina's 2 Billion Original Oil in Place with at 10% recovery factor worth $200 x 200,000,00 OOIP which is $400 Billion. Now it can only come out in BBLs/day and ramping up takes time but if its there,#Sur is a find.
9855 2018-07-31 00:04:15 Naaaah..... this is Chicago, we don’t do that........ahhh who am I kidding? It will be street brawl.
9856 2018-07-31 00:04:00 You know better.  You know this isn't happening.  You're not Woodward and Bernstein, but like you swore to earlier, you're an "actor."  Primarily in the business of selling snake oil supplements. Shameful.
9857 2018-07-31 00:03:56 I want my makeup done for my birthday but I want somebody who uses only oil free cosmetics
9858 2018-07-31 00:03:50 I blame you and only you.
9859 2018-07-31 00:03:50 I actually brush my teeth with baking soda and coconut oil
9860 2018-07-31 00:03:15 BS. Ruin one of the best salmon runs in this country. And we DO share a country with 49 other states. I have an interest in keeping the Gulf of Mexico free of oil spills, keeping New Orleans above water and stopping the CA wildfires. This land -all of it-was made for you and me.
9861 2018-07-31 00:02:58 It isn't fair though, I think she was pretty aware. In her previous gg article it has a picture with critics, John included, imposed over a witch burning oil painting. One of the first things you learn when you write is your hook and outro are the most important parts.
9862 2018-07-31 00:02:45 the oil ranch is a treasure
9863 2018-07-31 00:02:29 I drive too many miles in the year to pay for motor oil , I ain't no dummy
9864 2018-07-31 00:02:10 I had a synthetic oil change :/ high mileage
9865 2018-07-31 00:01:57 Bernie is a modern day snake oil salesman hustling people for a buck. It has worked out rather well for him.  He has found his most profitable niche with ignorant people that want "FREE" stuff.
9866 2018-07-31 00:01:48 Pipe down lady, see you hypocrite don’t hate Muslims for introducing mathematics and lemons and coffee to the world but you’d call the religion oppressive while your taxes go to fund Israel killing of Arabs or whiles oil and gases you us oppress these same Muslims really 
9867 2018-07-31 00:01:38 Finance and working in oil exploration.

9869 2018-07-31 00:01:33 How did I drop this heavy ass olive oil on my glass top stove and shatter my stove
9870 2018-07-31 00:01:24 いや～～ありがとうございます！(ありすちゃんの彼氏面)
9871 2018-07-31 00:01:16 Gotta filter him. He talks about scary boom boom things.
9872 2018-07-31 00:01:15 Honestly it looks so good, changing the oil and then gonna vacuum it really well
9873 2018-07-31 00:01:14 おはありー
9874 2018-07-31 00:01:08 They are not rights. Why would that be “sensitive?” Because it intimates people need to get a job?
9875 2018-07-31 00:01:06 It's what Norway had done.
CA social Dems will have to find a way to pay for entitlements. The other way to go is the UK model, who's NHS is anemic and national debt skyrocketing.

So CA liberals can embrace Oil and get medical or have neither.
9876 2018-07-31 00:01:05 Leased space, I ain’t painting shit
9877 2018-07-31 00:00:57 That stuff is basically filled w/toxic compounds (mostly vegetable oil). This shit is horrible for you.

9880 2018-07-31 00:00:28 USA är bff med Saudiarabien, de hjälper dem bland annat med deras "krig" mot Jemen. Kan argumenteras för att det är ett folkmord.

Men USA och omvärlden gots to have that oil.
9881 2018-07-31 00:00:26 “Are there any sick among you? Then ask the elders of the church to come and pray over the sick and anoint them with oil in the name of our Lord.”
James (Jacob) 5:14 TPT
9882 2018-07-31 00:00:23 If we have a bidding war for low-sulfur oil, pushing oil prices to well over $100 per barrel, then flowing barrels in 2020 will fetch much higher price than 2018. How do make money on oil in 2020? Buy it in 2018 and wait for market to come to you.
