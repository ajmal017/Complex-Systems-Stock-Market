59 2018-02-26 23:54:58 I just replied earlier specifically stating no privacy crypto is perfect but that monero serves the privacy role better than what btc can do CURRENTLY.  Obviously you have a Hardon for bashing monero - good luck with your btc privacy.

82 2018-02-26 23:51:51 One thing that's bad about #Crypto, you can't hold it in your hand like real money, it only exists as electronic data. 

That has metaphysical benefits that most do not understand.

It's far more than just paper notes or coins.
83 2018-02-26 23:51:50 This is crypto currency. He’s a computer scientist. He’s not a CEO. They program decentralized tech. He was working with the exchange without incident for a long time.

93 2018-02-26 23:50:27 Best crypto interview CNBCFastMoney has done yet. It's interesting & good news that, when asked to compare the adoption of the internet and the www to the adaption of blockchain technology, Joe Lubin thinks we are in the mid-90's.

94 2018-02-26 23:50:20 Nice
95 2018-02-26 23:50:17 I think the irony of crypto is that token issuers willing to manipulate the supply of their token, alternately incenting HODL and use, may end up having the most dedicated users and valuable tokens and networks.
96 2018-02-26 23:49:58 lol. You're not helping. If you want to help, take some time to understand what CfB has been trying to tell you.  It's clear that they are doing something new and innovative with crypto that you are not taking into account. It's almost painful watching him try 1/2

122 2018-02-26 23:45:30 The only real success I’ve had in crypto was buying after 10-15% dips. You’ll never be poor if you spend less than you make and invest in things you understand.

128 2018-02-26 23:44:52 Nobody seems to be demonizing crypto, and you have dealt the leading hand in the world of blind accusations, do you think just SAYING something makes it right or correct?, how much integrity can we expect?

131 2018-02-26 23:44:38 No cards, no card machine, no need. You scan a barcode on your phone. The only thing needed is the merchant to have the litepay program installed on their device for business use. The beauty of crypto is WE already have 100% of the infrastructure. Thats why it can spread so fast
132 2018-02-26 23:44:35 What were the total deposits to Overstock's tZero's ETH wallet Feb 12 to 18? 16,957 ETH. What were the total deposits Feb 19 to Feb 25? 3,745 ETH. They fell 4.5 times! Anybody can verify for themselves. The ICO is failing badly.
133 2018-02-26 23:44:34 It means that I understand how it works. Remind me what you use to buy your crypto, what you use to pay your taxes, your rent & buy your food?

144 2018-02-26 23:42:18 People will come to crypto and the place to be in crypto is in bitcoin. If you disagree that is fine, just my opinion. I don't think people are flocking, most people are watching, but volume sure will speak up soon. Volume and price.

146 2018-02-26 23:42:14 Yeah I feel the same way. Time to hedge
147 2018-02-26 23:42:13 100 JPY(BTC): 1063.170 ~ 1063.540 KRW(BTC)
148 2018-02-26 23:41:50 Ahh man, I was just there a month ago!  I stayed up the beach a bit in the tiki huts on cobble beach. You gotta hit Chiang Mai, beautiful country. Also, Congrats on your success. I've been following you for a short time now. Listened to your interview on The Bad Crypto Podcast.
149 2018-02-26 23:41:49 かつ丼鼻ちょうちんみたいな泡出てたぉｗ
150 2018-02-26 23:41:41 And what about you? What path to wealth would you choose without crypto?
151 2018-02-26 23:41:22 Man I’m so glad all the “bitcoin is a bubble” nonsense is over. People are realizing. #Crypto is here to stay. We in this for the long run #bitcoin
152 2018-02-26 23:41:16 BTC is dropping at the same time though..
153 2018-02-26 23:41:12 Any positive news from China with regards to $crypto , and the next mega bull run will likely start.
154 2018-02-26 23:41:04 I think governments will lean towards more trusted and efficient blockchain infrastructures like $Neo but this is definitely on the horizon
155 2018-02-26 23:40:56 nemketに出品してブログのネタにしてください
156 2018-02-26 23:40:54 trading opinion: Split 50/50 If you're feeling nervous
Personal opinion: run like hell
157 2018-02-26 23:40:51 If it’s obvious for anyone to see....then why has it gone down since ICO and not up? Money talks fellah and the market doesn’t agree with you.
158 2018-02-26 23:40:41 This good for ta noobs who know nothing?
159 2018-02-26 23:40:39 I do know this one m8 $lmc n like it n #hodl IT :>

161 2018-02-26 23:40:33 Retirement plan: open a fancy brunch spot called CryptToast. Only serves Toast, only accepts crypto $. @cseidenberg and I are gonna be rich. #crypto #toast
162 2018-02-26 23:40:13 ! #Darico will provide crypto investors, an exclusive access gate way to all #Darico investment tools, including the wallet, terminal, liquidity pool, exchange, debit card and index fund.
163 2018-02-26 23:39:59 love it
164 2018-02-26 23:39:56 no confirmamos si esta minando crypto todavia
165 2018-02-26 23:39:46 Imo not good
Its the point where actually all may dip as fuck all of the sudden
166 2018-02-26 23:39:42 #Darico is the ideal easy-access currency for aspiring crypto investors,  offering the incredible potential of cryptocurrencies but hedged by the safety of Gold, Bitcoin and Ether. Very promissing #ICO. Dont miss it!
167 2018-02-26 23:39:41 USI tech isnt crypto at all. Its a ponzi scheme, nothing to do with investing or crypro.
168 2018-02-26 23:39:24 Amazing team, shame about the robot voice and plastic Thor hammer!
169 2018-02-26 23:39:12 Ledger nano Sに入っていた，Bitcoin Goldの分離完了。分離して取り出した後，別のウォレットに送金するとき，何度やってもエラー。

送金手数料を上げるとうまく行きました。
170 2018-02-26 23:39:08 Which would you rather have. “Some inkling of opportunity” in $ZCL that it might not be down 85% in a week from now (it will), or the infinite fountain of opportunity that crypto can provide you using that same capital?
171 2018-02-26 23:38:59 I'm in! 
172 2018-02-26 23:38:55 Came to crypto to escape banks... Nothing to celebrate here!
173 2018-02-26 23:38:52 Nobody wants to develop shit into bcash, except for the biggests scammers in crypto history, faketoshi and roger
174 2018-02-26 23:38:52 Haha

176 2018-02-26 23:38:41 @YuriATeles Wit you mean exctly
177 2018-02-26 23:38:18 Based on what?, your demonstration here?, no facts or articles back what you’re saying about anything, and we have no disagreement on crypto.
178 2018-02-26 23:38:12 I a fuecking legend you'll find it hilarious how much money I lose in crypto
179 2018-02-26 23:38:11 Have you chosen a major yet?
180 2018-02-26 23:38:00 What happens when a company makes a bunch of money before the project is finished. Crypto analogy...?
181 2018-02-26 23:37:58 Yea I didn’t realize that until later then went to do it but I’d have to upload my DL and other sensitive info and I told myself I would do that anymore because I’ve shared that info with WAY too many sites since I got into crypto lol
Sorry man! 
182 2018-02-26 23:37:53 天才
183 2018-02-26 23:37:47 HODL, obviously
184 2018-02-26 23:37:39 Haven't met anyone in #crypto that isn't supposedly holding moonbags
185 2018-02-26 23:37:36 I’m hodling ven and wtc
186 2018-02-26 23:37:28 @CryptosQueen any news on litepay? Price is dropping cause of delay?

187 2018-02-26 23:37:14 why is there a list on robinhood for crypto 
188 2018-02-26 23:36:31 Crypto Dogg 
189 2018-02-26 23:36:31 #dwdd deze aflevering was zo crinchy!
190 2018-02-26 23:36:23 Yeah, but ltc price is dropping. Afraid it might drop more
191 2018-02-26 23:36:10 @IvanOnTech The recent purchase of poloniex is a serious danger to U.S crypto.  J.P Morgan will use SEC to kill tether.  They will then institute fiat currency only!  I am very concerned and upset, no enraged!  Will central authority win again?
192 2018-02-26 23:36:05 IT looks ready to fly
193 2018-02-26 23:36:02 Craig wright is the inventor and theft of his own invention?
194 2018-02-26 23:35:48 Phew! I was waiting for the All Systems deployment! Crypto incident? What's one of them? Crypto mining on the network??
195 2018-02-26 23:35:42 tZero hasn't integrated anything. Why do you think they have? They will have no liquidity and any tokens trading on it will have nothing but sellers.
196 2018-02-26 23:35:23 Not the whole story! Crypto mining is massively increasing demand for renewable energy sources
197 2018-02-26 23:34:47 Fair. It does detract from credibility, though, as many crypto communities rip each other. I’m left wondering about your ability to be objective.
198 2018-02-26 23:34:46 The price has stayed stagnant and I think a lot of people are becoming concerned. I run a pretty large and solid crypto group and it’s gotten to the point where people are making jokes and Memes about Tron Because they don’t believe in it
199 2018-02-26 23:34:40 I like you crypto bullet but you need my help and my intuition. I get 25% of whatever you make but it's tough decisions I make on your behalf.
200 2018-02-26 23:34:23 Thx birbie
Let's get IT all together
201 2018-02-26 23:34:16 fuck it im going to hodl my $ZCL and these $BTCP better be bloody worth it!
202 2018-02-26 23:34:00 Damn banks, no taking our territory pls
203 2018-02-26 23:33:56 This is a trivial product. Nothing at all interesting about it.
204 2018-02-26 23:33:51 #Nodepower Have you join and participate on  Node ICO? This project is one of the greatest ICO in the current crypto space !  Let's all join, participate, and invest! you won't regret it!
205 2018-02-26 23:33:48 Bear market for 1.5-2 years though?  2018 will be monumental for crypto.
206 2018-02-26 23:33:46 But does it mine crypto?
207 2018-02-26 23:33:42 You Go! When you on the top everyone trying to bring you down.  #youdaman #crypto #ta
208 2018-02-26 23:33:36 Not at all a case of clicking on the wrong button or the dreaded All Systems collection deployment. A crypto incident unfortunately, but recovered from and a happy customer.
209 2018-02-26 23:33:25 he looks about 70 yrs old, surprised he can even turn on a computer LOL
210 2018-02-26 23:33:04 Getting my crypto wings back daily. I’m back on earth after the GTO palm beach pump lol
211 2018-02-26 23:32:56 Agreed. This is great for the health of the bank. I'm willing to bet the strategic investors came from crypto depositors.  

Read: They essentially moved cash on the bank's balance sheet from the liabilities column to assets column; and, as a result, basically self-insured.
212 2018-02-26 23:32:54 Dangerous hot-take that no one asked for: Yes, the market, generally speaking, not referring to a particular day or week but the past month or two, has been down. 

It’s a time-of-year thing. Same thing every year. For years. There’re just more people watching now.

#crypto #btc
213 2018-02-26 23:32:40 Binance will support ?
214 2018-02-26 23:32:31 HODL and chill bruh
215 2018-02-26 23:32:29 still missing that avatar...
216 2018-02-26 23:32:21 Correction: ~100th of the cost.  Math part of the brain ain't working today apparently.
217 2018-02-26 23:32:14 Awesome! DM me or @crypto_chicks for more details :)
218 2018-02-26 23:32:06 Yeah, try buying the top (or damn near close enough) of $SUB and hodl-ing down 70% 
219 2018-02-26 23:32:06 You realize that $ostk's tzero's failing ICO won't even make up a tiny fraction of the market cap that $ostk gained since their money-grab announcement?
220 2018-02-26 23:32:03 The physical card is, but who still uses cards when we have NFC equip mobile phones?  The merchant gateway goes live later today :)
221 2018-02-26 23:32:00 p sure he tweeted a general "esports fuckbois in crypto, i know you're not doing your taxes right, hit me up" and i was dyingg
222 2018-02-26 23:31:34 Too much thinking is bad in crypto world. Now you are too late
223 2018-02-26 23:31:32 Crocuta got a few of the cackle involved. They did not have the patience, now I'm alone
224 2018-02-26 23:31:29 Niiiiice.  I just recently started buying in after a while doing conventional stocks.  The kind of growth were seeing in crypto is unheard of in investing.  How long you been at it?
225 2018-02-26 23:31:26 Crypto still everything
226 2018-02-26 23:31:12 You're married now!
227 2018-02-26 23:30:52 Since you get one btcp per ZCL or BTC, (1 gets you 1) you can effectively obtain more BTCP at a cheaper price point (~10th the cost of btc).
228 2018-02-26 23:30:40 It's game over for $ostk. A functioning, liquid exchange and payment system and the backing of the biggest firm on Wall Street vs a third-rate retailer with no product or team
229 2018-02-26 23:30:32 I want whatever you are smoking.
230 2018-02-26 23:30:27 Hodl

236 2018-02-26 23:30:00 sorry to tell you... but the blockchain world has to wrote articles for principiant, thi is a great article, but a new crypto user will never understend. you have to starto to vrote as you are explain thinks to a 5 yo children. Make even ''uncle Barry'' to understand.
237 2018-02-26 23:29:59 I got eth under 10. It was my intro to crypto. Hoping one or some of the alts I bought in December pull an eth this year.

240 2018-02-26 23:29:52 Get out probably. Seems the season. One lost my ads with NANO so that's fun. But apparently I haven't had enough because I'm going back in. Lol
241 2018-02-26 23:29:48 You either believe $BTCP will make you money or not. I'm hodling. Too late to sell now. No one should be using money they need for coins anyway.
242 2018-02-26 23:29:27 Seriously.  And $ZCL holders. Did u watch $NXT ?
243 2018-02-26 23:29:26 They also took over the word "crypto"
244 2018-02-26 23:29:24 RMA sent, hopefully i can get this card switched out... if not... where can i get one for cheap that hasnt been inflated by crypto miners?....
245 2018-02-26 23:29:20 Fiddy was the real Satoshi. He gave away his coins for our sins

247 2018-02-26 23:29:14 Seems to me that in order to get & before the institutional money flows into crypto certain criteria must be met legally ...I'm taking this as a step forward for Wall St to participate

264 2018-02-26 23:27:13 @PhilakoneCrypto Just wanted to say I hate so bad what you’re having to go thru!!  You don’t know me but, II have learned so much from you and going through your material. You are a definite asset to the crypto community!! Don’t let all the dip shits/haters get you down!!!!

268 2018-02-26 23:27:01 I feel self-worth can be truly found in the pursuit of the crypto currency
269 2018-02-26 23:26:54 really you need to ask look at the prices
270 2018-02-26 23:26:53 Hitbtc is up there with the biggest exchanges, others will follow. And I’d say most people are in it for the long run so@won’t care if it@drops post fork?
271 2018-02-26 23:26:48 I salute your passion. Just like Olympic torch you are 'Crypto Torch'
272 2018-02-26 23:26:45 Chart looks ok...but idc cuz im doin  that stress free lifestyle thing now.  Dumped em for a real shitcoin, life good
273 2018-02-26 23:26:41 Just finished listening to @CryptoStreetPod with @cryptodemedici  as today’s guest.  Great listen as they gave some insight into their thought process on this crypto space.  Strong work 
274 2018-02-26 23:26:36 @Landm_Marius Just joined your Crypto Friends!  Time to make some serious cabbage!
275 2018-02-26 23:26:30 Bittrex still have a day and a half. Cutting it close but I've seen stranger things happen. Why would they miss out on all the easy trade fees?
276 2018-02-26 23:26:25 LOL @RealJamesWoods..... It's fun to watch a pathetic old bigot try to pass himself off as a conservative-minded, quasi-intellectual. You're enlightened like Alaskan winters. Vidal would call you a "crypto Nazi." Vidal would have been correct.
277 2018-02-26 23:26:23 HODL with the rest of us idiots 
278 2018-02-26 23:26:21 Bring back the old Rand. Ive been following since 5000 sats
279 2018-02-26 23:26:17 Just ignore haters and keep going 
280 2018-02-26 23:26:14 And just because people are interested in future change (or any change really), does not mean anything to people who don't REALLY care. There are 1000 issues we can focus on that have significance, but we can't all manage 1000 issues. So we only choose the ones we like.
281 2018-02-26 23:26:11 Don't forget to allocate some to crypto  ;-)
282 2018-02-26 23:26:11 did $ZCL sting? I know how that feels with $nxt
283 2018-02-26 23:26:00 However it could once again harm the community: I can already see some media headlines « Bitcoin founder sued for theft ».

296 2018-02-26 23:24:43 Real crypto investors want to own the coin, not purchase an option.  Why doesn’t TD offer the ability to purchase crypto?
297 2018-02-26 23:24:42 朝から蕎麦屋です。今日はちょっと遅めの出勤
298 2018-02-26 23:24:34 First, I take exception to the notion that the SEC, or anyone, claims that no crypto company is in compliance. I know several entities that have approached the SEC and have either been denied, or have taken advantage of an available exception.
299 2018-02-26 23:24:30 Here I thought we where all just drowning in our sorrows...hang in guys Jeff’s right on the money here. Trust that after 2.5 yrs of trading crypto it’s still just as wild a ride and even more so Is it rewarding. No free rides. Crypto works for you as hard as you work for it.
300 2018-02-26 23:24:28 ぼくの思い描くレイヤーの構造と、ふーさん(@chubchubkun )の思い描くレイヤーの構造は、似ているところもあるけど違うところも結構あって面白い。
301 2018-02-26 23:24:03 Postcoin because it's a long working project that just finished it's audit. $600k market cap$$$ only 16.2 million. @CoinExchangeio @livecoin_net @Cryptopia_NZ 
No worries about volume, this is long term hold. Low pos. @POSTcoinArena crypto future is near.
302 2018-02-26 23:24:00 Should I head for the hills and capitulate on my $ZCL trade (basically break even) or hodl like an idiot
303 2018-02-26 23:23:55 What would you think from someone who gave training courses?
Besides that: my biggest VEN buys were sub 3k sats, so a lot should happen before risk management comes into play for me....
304 2018-02-26 23:23:25 What is your point?  That there is no perfect privacy crypto out there now?  Yes, you are correct. :)  Let's hear the privacy crypto you would trust your life on?  The Monero team is ACTIVELY working on the shortcomings you mention.

308 2018-02-26 23:22:50 @FollowingGuru1 do you offer crypto trade coaching?
309 2018-02-26 23:22:38 Plot twist. They get involved in crypto currency and become financially stable because we’re approaching singularity in terms of technology. They will integrate first because they’re already half way there.
310 2018-02-26 23:22:36 What's your cutoff to consider a coin low mcap
311 2018-02-26 23:22:28 Vibranium is certainly crypto and Shuri is Satoshi
312 2018-02-26 23:22:20 Ur mcm bought crypto when everyone was talking about it didn’t do his research and freaked out and sold when it dropped. U telling all your friends how he really ain’t shit bc he won’t take u on a real date but he too broke now to take u out
313 2018-02-26 23:22:13 Haters gonna hate. Thanks for the amazing content you create daily. Some of us actually appreciate it a lot!

318 2018-02-26 23:21:37 It's okay, it happens to everybody and in a way I kind of thought it was going to go somewhere for a little bit longer but it pooped out or died more physical or Crash and Burn a little sooner than I thought :-(

322 2018-02-26 23:20:26 Today's acquisition of Poloniex by Circle (Goldman Sachs backed) is just the start of many M&A deals in the #crypto industry. What makes this space so interesting is that many of the deals in the next few years will involve companies that don't yet exist.

324 2018-02-26 23:20:13 As a $ZCL "investor" that is currently at break even, I appreciate you shredding my dumb trade. I deserve it

340 2018-02-26 23:18:10 Bitcoin may at SOME POINT in the future implement SOME privacy, fact is right NOW if you need private crypto transactions, Monero is the best option out there.  If you live somewhere where your life or jail time depends on crypto privacy, what are you going to choose?!?

344 2018-02-26 23:17:41 Historical data in crypto is about as reliable is reading charts. Crypto is a currency not a stock. So using the same tools to predict trends and or prices don't apply all the time. Want to be able to predict crypto? Become an expert at new investor behavior. Weak hands ruin $$$$

349 2018-02-26 23:16:57 It's like asking college kids if they want to become wealthy, most say yes. Then you tell them to save 10% monthly, live bare minimally, start a business, accrue assets, etc. Do you think most listen? No, bc they simply don't have enough desire too.
350 2018-02-26 23:16:41 That's the beauty of the #LitecoinFam... most of us already have our crypto portfolios set up and we're not pushing the latest ICOs to invest in or that.  We just $LTC!
351 2018-02-26 23:16:36 Hmmmmmmmmm...Crypto Rand was tweeting about Waves & Powr yesterday...getting some ground well here...

When I feel I'm getting a bead on what's going on - it takes a left turn. I've got chopped to bits lately.

394 2018-02-26 23:10:22 Nothing is impossible it can come down as quick as it went up. Nice tight stop losses and not being greedy has paid of greatly for me in #crypto.

407 2018-02-26 23:08:25 Scary. I don’t think the traditional financial institutions (even though Goldman Sachs is only 1 of many investors in Circle) getting into crypto is a good sign. Best they stay segregated so that there is no spill over effect should anything happen in the crypto space

424 2018-02-26 23:05:39 You can develop an ASIC to work with any algo; although, it may not be practical to do so.  But if the crypto-coin is valuable enough, then ASIC's will enter.  Proof of Stake, is really the only way to avoid ASIC's altogether.
425 2018-02-26 23:05:21 Or any of you crypto gurus out there

432 2018-02-26 23:04:45 this react premarketing phase is oddly similar to the crypto token marketing i see on my twitter feed

434 2018-02-26 23:04:41 Any chance of analyzing Ambrosus (AMB)?
435 2018-02-26 23:04:37 I very much agree! So many self proclaimed experts pretending to know better than the rest, when in fact they're just another average Joe with an opinion. No one knows what the crypto-future holds. Trx has potential for big growth but could also fail
436 2018-02-26 23:04:35 Me too but most people want to be spoon fed like “what can I spend 10$ on right now and it’ll turn into $1k” not caring about the companies all..my boss has like ~100k in crypto and all he want is 300% profits over night I had to force him to think differently
437 2018-02-26 23:04:32 Truly has been a slow week in cryptos. Good to put in perspective dat da market is still makin 5-10% swings on da daily and dis is considered steady! We should see some serious price action after dis market slumber. I am excite for wat da future has in store for cryptos bruddas!

4. $SNT score: 7.6923
5. $AUR score: 6.9231
441 2018-02-26 23:04:04 Exactly. The bankers are trying to subvert crypto by taking control of exchanges.
442 2018-02-26 23:03:51 I did the same thing. Had 3.5 and held for over a year.

444 2018-02-26 23:03:20 Had a dream last night..bitcoin came down to $3.1k! Woke up to $10+k today..whew! That felt so real. #crypto lol
445 2018-02-26 23:03:16 Hey #cryptotwitter, wouldn't this not matter with > 50% penetration of crypto?
446 2018-02-26 23:03:02 I've been involved with crypto since 2009. It always turns my stomach, and I always leave, before kicking myself when it spikes again.

There's money to be made there, especially in the services. Maybe you'll end up on the right side of one of those.
447 2018-02-26 23:02:59 Ouch Thanks for your efforts!
448 2018-02-26 23:02:58 I was literally just saying to myself "what are all of these Payment Channel Claims" and then the next tweet I scrolled to was this one. Lol.

451 2018-02-26 23:02:33 Now I am gonna figure out how to explain crypto using black panther as the framing tool
452 2018-02-26 23:02:29 Half way back to ATH, with a market that has not even begun a true bull run. When crypto starts moving again, we could see massive gains very quickly. We are seeing litecoin move 20$ in a day during a slump.
453 2018-02-26 23:02:28 Fuck all the media....except for one reason.... To pump muh bags! Btw, the only media I need for crypto is podcasts, with your session on crypto street being the most informative one listened to. Thanks
454 2018-02-26 23:02:28 Awesome 
455 2018-02-26 23:02:20 Should I split into separate crypto / Heat accounts
456 2018-02-26 23:02:12 It may be clear that a new #BTC cycle is really on its way now. Almost all #ALTS bleeding value. Are you all reinvesting? What do you think the new high of #BTC will be? #Crypto
457 2018-02-26 23:02:12 You are welcome
458 2018-02-26 23:02:08 3/4 The fact that popular newer accounts retaliates and attack you guys back, and many a times, worse than you guys initially throws shade, makes this whole Old vs New "crypto twitter personality" in the eye of newcomer like me. I am sure I'm not the only person that see this way
459 2018-02-26 23:01:59 i dont remember how got in to, but first i found and mined about 70 btc with pc, just to make money from internet..i think there was ‘10, then i remembered i have some btc when its was rallying from 20 to 50 ir something in ‘11 winter.. sold everything for $100.. then..
460 2018-02-26 23:01:54 Since 2017 #Bitcoin has gained by at least 300% in the time between corrections. There were three correction months for #BTC in 2017. If it follows a similar path in 2018 it’s not crazy to expect $28k this year. That might not even be the landing spot for 2018. #crypto
461 2018-02-26 23:01:48 Please make a video about @havven_io! ICO going on right now
462 2018-02-26 23:01:45 @Haejin_Crypto What to do for an analyse of a coin that i would really like to see?
463 2018-02-26 23:01:42 @Haejin_Crypto Could you do #TEL and #CV? Some smaller coins that have peeked my interest
464 2018-02-26 23:01:33 Yes absolutely
465 2018-02-26 23:01:31 In crypto world whoever does not agree with you has an IQ of under 110  ... People are so full ego everyone thinks they are the God of cryptocurrency .. btw #BTCP just announced now Hitbtc is also supporting them
466 2018-02-26 23:01:26 No, I made a mistake. Should have been at 9300.
Fun fact: did a training webinar last week for our members and this afternoon they explained me what I did wrong 
467 2018-02-26 23:01:22 Is it even remotely possible that these folks are the "first and only company" who have approached the SEC about a crypto exchange? Or was that slide written a couple of years ago?
468 2018-02-26 23:01:15 おはようだぉ。今日もＰＣさわる時間なさそうだぉ。
469 2018-02-26 23:01:11 Open your eyes. Bankers are trying to subvert crypto by taking control of the exchanges.
470 2018-02-26 23:01:08 I'm not eating at @Wendys until they lay out their stance on charter schools.
471 2018-02-26 23:01:03 Happy for you, but given the nature of this “community,” you might be a little too forthcoming with your net worth. For a thousand good, all it takes is one bad to change it all.
472 2018-02-26 23:00:58 In my opinion the ONLY esports crypto token that has actually innovated so far is @firstbloodio
473 2018-02-26 23:00:58 Crypto is the new smoking
474 2018-02-26 23:00:51 Just a month ago he said bitcoin and crypto was over. You want to ask him to make predictions now? It will depend on the market on a given day, waste of time just look at CMC to get Richards opinion.

490 2018-02-26 22:59:15 I hear ya,  just block it out, I was blocked by 2 of them for no reason and never gave one, positivity is a constant
491 2018-02-26 22:59:13 Love it :) Do you accepted Crypto?
492 2018-02-26 22:58:57 Oh, true. I see now. Thanks lol
493 2018-02-26 22:58:56 Same
494 2018-02-26 22:58:50 i have not but i will
495 2018-02-26 22:58:48 anyone that can make it these past few months  will be crypto strong forever
496 2018-02-26 22:58:44 they used the British spelling of 'revolutionise', so that narrows it down...
497 2018-02-26 22:58:37 Do you think it will be final cycle of big gains in crypto at all? Or you mean only this year?
498 2018-02-26 22:58:22 O maior perigo não é uma correção ou uma downtrend no mercado e sim, estar fora dele!  $BTC #crypto
499 2018-02-26 22:58:17 I’m starting my own crypto journey, it will be slow and steady, lots of patience needed, but it will be all worth it in the end!
500 2018-02-26 22:58:14 Thats the point, he never confirmed it.
501 2018-02-26 22:57:57 Hi Steve, love your videos. I've got one question regarding this video. If we should aim to buy crypto at 50% off of ATH, how would that have played out in the run up of BTC from early to late 2017? During this period, there wouldn't have been such an opportunity. Thank you.
502 2018-02-26 22:57:52 guess per Warren Buffett's comment, "don't ask the barber if you need a haircut" has a double meaning here. Guessing he is pro crypto....
503 2018-02-26 22:57:49 I highly recommend my followers check out Ben G @coinreserve for insights, tips and advice in the crypto space, I've followed Ben for some time now and highly value his honest opinion
504 2018-02-26 22:57:34 #DearDiary
505 2018-02-26 22:57:25 My general reply was in reference to your ICO comment being a shit show so far this year. Why $MWAT is interesting  is obvious for anyone to see 
506 2018-02-26 22:57:22 Have to be honest, I've lost orders of magnitude more on AIM through iffy placings and rogue behind the scenes deals than Crypto. Funny thing about these analysts is they tend to buy in just after any dip comes from their proclamations of doom...

510 2018-02-26 22:57:08 This is a great innovation that s of benefit to both new and experienced traders. It's a much anticipated solution in the crypto-world .it promises to get even better.... Can't wait for the ICO.

511 2018-02-26 22:57:07 i’m all over this crypto shit and i wasn’t aware of it so that must tell you something

515 2018-02-26 22:56:51 I noticed that too, not sure how to read that other than it can go either way from here?
516 2018-02-26 22:56:50 Every time I see the word "BCash" my resolve to be part of making Bitcoin Cash become the success that Bitcoin was meant to be only strengthens. Every one in this crypto space is only here because of the Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper; the very design which Bitcoin Cash aligns to.
517 2018-02-26 22:56:38 great news for the crypto asset market... will bring improved infrastructure and pave the way for more institutional money to flow into the market

521 2018-02-26 22:56:07 I've never traded stocks, but think you have/do. Does the same happen with those, or is it a crypto thing?

537 2018-02-26 22:54:58 Wrong you are already the greatest crypto media person
538 2018-02-26 22:54:55 Many of us missed out on being apart of crypto twitter back in 2014. Firstly for the community and secondly for the opportunity.

But if you made the right moves, you could have turned $200 into $1,000,000 within the last 6 months.

Hypothetical but possible.

#KeepHustling
539 2018-02-26 22:54:51 There's days & weeks where the best move has been to keep your hands off the wheel (unless you're @AngeloBTC ), and weeks that require planning, timing, and lots of real time attention.

Currently they are attempting to patent betting in esports with a crypto token. The arrogance with which they posted this like they are the saviours of esports in crypto is the real shock.

546 2018-02-26 22:54:25 Some takeaways from today's #hbsltv case on @Jibo, which could just as easily be said for crypto:
547 2018-02-26 22:54:24 I’m intrigued by crypto currencies, but curious how you decide when to jump in / out?  Following any specific model(s) or professional services for market intel?   Or, just gut?
548 2018-02-26 22:54:19 bittrex is 350mil in volume. the crypto markets totals 20+ billion. Dont think the team was dumb enough to apply to just bittrex.

564 2018-02-26 22:51:27 It also says: Land within Decentraland is represented by non-fungible LAND tokens (meaning that each is unique and cannot be replicated) that track ownership of the Ethereum blockchain. Owning LAND within Decentraland is akin to owning any other unique, crypto collectible asset

573 2018-02-26 22:50:51 Now they can run naked shorts on the futures and trip all the stop losses on the way down so the can resell you your own crypto. They will be able to see all the orders, you won't.  Sheeple
574 2018-02-26 22:50:38 Top 5 alts for 3-6 months

2) Ripple - the standard 
3) 0X - erc20 trading on the eth network!!
4) Ark - smart bridge tech to combine multiple bit of tech into one
5) Litecoin - silver to btc gold

#crypto #blockchain
575 2018-02-26 22:50:18 But doesn't it make it excruciatingly frustrating when most people you meet think they're geniuses because they bought btc/eth early? imo there's so much bs in crypto.
576 2018-02-26 22:49:58 Testing and evaluation a new upcoming fork testnet before announcing a support of #BTCP from one of the biggest exchanges in the crypto world is not unprofessional they way you are dealing with this as an impatient entity is unprofessional :D

It's good to receive ur different look on the IOTA hash function but in an academic manner, which I CLEARLY can't see in dionyziz postings. Just assertion and FUD/hate. Pls contribute, thank you
580 2018-02-26 22:49:16 I love crypto because of the possibilities that block-chain technology open in front of us. I hate exchanges because of their attitude and because day by day they start to act as shameless banks nowadays. In my opinion, exchanges badly needs to be regulated.

587 2018-02-26 22:48:26 CRYPTO NEWS TODAY: 

BlackRock Global Chief Investment strategist makes the statement that cryptocurrency "should only be considered by those who can stomach potentially complete losses."

I wonder how he is going to feel when #Crypto goes #2themoon

600 2018-02-26 22:46:40 Neil “mad-as-fuck” McCauley, he’s straight “slangin crypto”. Watch out for this certified badass, guys. He’s taking over!
601 2018-02-26 22:46:38 I think the big winners in crypto currency are those who have figured out how to steal the (untraceable) crypto currency.
602 2018-02-26 22:46:23 Nice Sarah!
603 2018-02-26 22:45:52 So you’re saying were about to approach the historic 2013 runup and we only just hit the analagous $250 high? I would agree. 50-100k definitely a possibility
604 2018-02-26 22:45:50 only for bitcoin though 
605 2018-02-26 22:45:50 agree.....it just became a crypto Faceebook where everything is about ego....bad energy. guess i'm leaving it soon to. thx for everything and good luck

613 2018-02-26 22:44:32 Five books to be read by crypto investors.

617 2018-02-26 22:44:21 I start to believe that regulation in crypto world is something that we badly need ! Not as in "coin" regulation, more as in EXCHANGES regulation.

619 2018-02-26 22:43:49 Relevance to crypto seems limited even if it shows high quantum annealing speedup over classical SA. Shor's Algorithm requires a universal quantum computer. D-wave does only QA. (Corrections welcome; open questions still open.)
620 2018-02-26 22:43:29 I agree that people are placing too much importance on litepay.  However, I would like to get your ideas on why crypto is in a 1.5-2 year bear market.  It doesn't seem that way compared to historical data so far but I'm very new so I could totally be overlooking data.
621 2018-02-26 22:43:29 Or I will pay for someone to pick it up for me. I will pay in crypto

624 2018-02-26 22:43:02 He says this book'll tell me all the best crypto coins 'till the end of this century. All I have to do is bet on a winner, and I'll never lose. So I say, "What's the catch?" He says, "No catch, just keep it a secret." After that, he disappeared. I never saw him again.
625 2018-02-26 22:43:01 @WeissRatings are panicking because #Crypto people are sharing their crypto ratings on twitter and with friends.

“Don’t trust shared #Weissratings because they could be doctored”.

LOL yeah, my mates just photoshopped a dodgy report to lead me astray.

632 2018-02-26 22:42:22 So there I was, minding my own business when this crazy old codger with a cane showed up. He says he's my distant relative. I didn't see any resemblance. So he says, "How would you like to be rich?" So I say, "Sure." So he lays this book on me.
633 2018-02-26 22:42:18 Just another bull run before we have crypto people making top notch content.

635 2018-02-26 22:42:02 The idea isn't to prove your ability to invest in crypto, it's to use blockchain technology to prove your ability to invest in everything else (equities, commodities, currencies, VC, anything)

672 2018-02-26 22:38:02 1. My 1st crypto experience was a tad frustrating.  My wife & I try to make most of our significant purchases/investments in agreement. I wanted to buy a couple of Bitcoins in May. Price was $1,700.  She was not sold, asked opinion of my BiL, who works for a big financial house

680 2018-02-26 22:37:11 We are NOT a pump (and dump) group, we only analyze and gather real results, taken from the exchanges, based on real data.

689 2018-02-26 22:35:29 I like NEO a lot actually. I just don’t like TV personalities allowing people to make impulsive investment decisions, based upon a “Crypto” investment rating company that’s only been around for two months
690 2018-02-26 22:35:10 On the spectrum of sketchy things, binary trading is the bottom end. I hope it gets abolished. It almost makes crypto currency look virginal.

694 2018-02-26 22:35:00 @officialmcafee Hi, I have contacted you few weeks ago about an idea for a device for crypto and internet users. You did not respond. Of course I don't blame you. What would it take for you to treat this seriously? Please advise... Thanks
695 2018-02-26 22:34:54 Ok. Thanks. Unfortunately, I'm ultra non programmer savvy. So much of that looks like a foreign language to me. Can you simplify for dummies like me. I thank you a million times over for your patience & understanding.

725 2018-02-26 22:30:37 How many #Litecoin  do you own? #Litepay #LitecoinFam
726 2018-02-26 22:30:33 They all think it's a scam lol see if they are saying that in a years time 
727 2018-02-26 22:30:16 Based on what I have learned about Blockchain/Crypto from @morningstream this looks like a great investment opportunity. Are you going to share this email or just get rich by yourself?
728 2018-02-26 22:30:07 @ben12617296 hey man I don’t wanna go back and forth I hope u find financial freedom from crypto! Good luck with your investments and I respect your opinion of ripple and xrp

730 2018-02-26 22:29:56 先週末から買い増ししようと下で待ち構えてたけど、買おうと思った価格帯まで来ると弱気ニュース流れて、二の足踏んでたら急反発_(:3 」∠)_

私のようなパンピーは情報に踊らされますなー_(:3 」∠)_
731 2018-02-26 22:29:52 alot of buy in right now, rise as crazy, should come down soon
732 2018-02-26 22:29:50 DO IT!!!! I KNOW YOU WILL DO IT!!!! #Philabest
733 2018-02-26 22:29:48 Well done guys. Wish you success. Switzerland is the smart move. This is the European country of crypto.
734 2018-02-26 22:29:47 If you don't have a private key, you don't own your crypto. Hardware wallets all the way
735 2018-02-26 22:29:42 We’ll support you Philakone!
736 2018-02-26 22:29:22 HE

MOTHAFOOKAAAAASSSS!!!!
737 2018-02-26 22:29:08 Shit sorry, I'm no help, just saying what I'd read 
738 2018-02-26 22:29:07 Nope, I just received a call from a guy named Joel who did apologize on behalf of the company. He promise to get in touch with me later and sort out the mess.
739 2018-02-26 22:28:58 After the nonsense about stellar comparison with Ripple from @WeissRatings, they ask if real worl usage is ulimportant.. wow don’t you think that’s the most important? Or can crypto survive in a bubble with moons and rockets sustaining it? Ripple is a real project. Not a ponzi
740 2018-02-26 22:28:47 super-crypto-mighty-tech-leader
741 2018-02-26 22:28:46 i dont think crypto is exactly like the dot com bubble. cryptos are more financial than technological. websites ultimately had no inherent value. a lot of crypto coins and tokens have some applicable functions if traded in large volume.
742 2018-02-26 22:28:40 Awesome 
743 2018-02-26 22:28:35 遂にFINRAとcryptoのキーワードが増えてきたな。BTCの起源を考えると残念だが、界隈がどんどんと金融を理解するにつれ結局は金融野郎達が牛耳る現実が解ると思う。過去の仮想通貨はトレカ交換所レベル。やっと本当のトレーディングが始まる。先月FINRAに行った事を書きましたが無関係ではないかも？
744 2018-02-26 22:28:27 I’ve been saying this guy has been a scammer for ages now, I’ve called every single BTC movement since this year and tweet them publicly, meanwhile guys like these are getting people rekt and not even apologizing for it.
745 2018-02-26 22:28:27 I see lot pf trolls here.. Simply the guy is completing what he forgot to mention before.. He didnt has a date ..clearly they working to announce a timeline,  TRX will follow NEO in the future,  simply you under estimate how many ppls in china believe in this 2 coins
746 2018-02-26 22:28:22 Does Anyone have experience building a Crypto Mining Rig?

Get in touch ASAP
747 2018-02-26 22:28:17 It's dumb they "can't talk about it". Ain't no rules in crypto
748 2018-02-26 22:28:12 届きました！ありがとうこざいます
749 2018-02-26 22:28:09 wall street crash coming folks they are manipulating DJI and Fiat currency and global economy so that you think everything is OK so sell your houses crypto and stocks  , stay homeless for 2 weeks and than buy everything back .. Its all in my report people
750 2018-02-26 22:27:55 Better than being dragged out 
751 2018-02-26 22:27:47 Then maybe you shouldn't call somebody out when you knowingly lack information.
752 2018-02-26 22:27:46 I’m not invested in any crypto, have nothing to do with CC space at all really and even i am aghast - looked at completely in isolation, no professional would have behaved like that
753 2018-02-26 22:27:44 @circlepay has bought Poloniex.  Won't be long before they screw over crypto lovers once again by closing accounts.  Close your @Poloniex now and #BoycottPoloniex
754 2018-02-26 22:27:29 Hey @Newegg, are you out of all the decent @TEAMEVGA video GTX 1060 and higher video cards because of crypto miners? My just shy of 4 year old EVGA 770 GTX suddenly died :(
755 2018-02-26 22:27:28 You got me into golf betting, crypto and now possible options?  What a place Twitter is
756 2018-02-26 22:27:20 #Power to the people! My head is not around crypto, but it is fascinating how improved PV’s, #battery tech and the emergent #EV, in its myriad forms, is such an enabler of cottage industries, in ways that were never imagined. #distributed power #charging #Grameen Bank
757 2018-02-26 22:27:18 so true...@dum's haircut is a worrying sign
758 2018-02-26 22:27:08 Suit bubble. Sell the top. Pipes are next. Buy the dip on pipes!
759 2018-02-26 22:27:02 Hey @JayInslee, 
The list of exchanges approved by WA to exchange crypto currencies is very limited. 
I believe the stark application requirements are inhibiting economic growth and millennial interest in the state.
760 2018-02-26 22:27:00 that would be some really nice kind of difference between a stock/forex exchange and a crypto exchange.. imagine if this would be "default".. giving the new assets automatically to your customers. offline regime leaders would cry. mic drop.
761 2018-02-26 22:27:00 Lsd
762 2018-02-26 22:26:57 @Chase & @jpmorgan just wanted to say thanks for protecting me from myself by blocking my $XRP & #LTC #crypto purchase you assholes. No problem taking out $5k cash advance at a casino though. Closing both my accounts and my wife’s as well.
#GetFucked

764 2018-02-26 22:26:47 If you enter the crypto market with intentions of becoming an financial/social influence, how to react to salty behavior should be part of your personal white paper. Don't feed your audience the bottom of the pretzel bag.
765 2018-02-26 22:26:45 To start they will get a lot of business working with Dubai &Saudia Arabia govts. Also believe once fiat accepted in Palmex everyone in the area will start buying crypto& of course dbix. Many coins in crypto in billions as concept only. We real &running already. Also low supply
766 2018-02-26 22:26:40 Eric, literally no one in crypto cares about this.
767 2018-02-26 22:26:37 
768 2018-02-26 22:26:35 I only take crypto advice from the guy that doesn't shower and wears the same clothes for a week straight.
769 2018-02-26 22:26:32 Has anyone been privy to any of James Altucher's crypto "secrets"? Curious what projects he's promoting. I'm actually a huge fan. Just didn't follow his clickbait crypto ads as they felt scammy.
770 2018-02-26 22:26:32 "When my shit is handled, I'll be on a mission to over take twitter and YouTube, and be the biggest crypto social media personality. This hatred and fire is pure fuel today. Will work with no one and will be the best."
771 2018-02-26 22:26:16 Then what’s the logic in purchasing the exchange? If Circle goes back to offering only BTC and ETH that puts them right back at square one when they used to offer crypto/fiat. Acquisition makes no sense if all alts are scraped from polo.
772 2018-02-26 22:26:11 Replace 'crypto' with almost anything and that statement rings true. Except maybe 'masturbation'
773 2018-02-26 22:25:54 You need to check out @DiviProject  Masternode coin. You are missing totally out on one of the best coins in crypto. Look my twitter wall for info.
774 2018-02-26 22:25:17 Phil, keep your head cool, forget about those motherfuckers, 99% wants you back safe and sound, the sooner the better.....much love  @AltOne_Crypto
775 2018-02-26 22:24:47 I thought you were looking for inspiration, that's why I said that this probably isn't the answer you're looking for. I've always been mildly interested in passive income through business and investments, but until crypto I wasn't really passionate about it.
776 2018-02-26 22:24:31 $zcl is an example of not getting married to a coin, and not getting too greedy in #crypto. Even respected people who I learn a lot from have turned into fanboys, cherry picking reasons why the $btcp fork isn't a get rich quick scheme. Exchanges dont owe you anything.
777 2018-02-26 22:24:12 This is why I fucking love crypto twitter

781 2018-02-26 22:24:00 I'm not sure if we're rising on 3 or if we just hit 4 and going up 5.  Some help please.  On my phone and won't be home 2 computer for a couple hours.
782 2018-02-26 22:23:59 OK, you're capable of that, pew di pie of crypto. I guess.
783 2018-02-26 22:23:57 Me too! I even gots a smart bizniss hat.
784 2018-02-26 22:23:57 You want to look at trading crypto as if you're investing as a VC...most bets wont work out. You just need to be bigly correct a few times. Typically advise 1% of your portfolio per trade. Of course, barely anyone listens to that guideline
785 2018-02-26 22:23:43 Conclusion - more women needed in crypto to save men from strip club events tweetstorm helped me forget I missed my $ltc sell point 
786 2018-02-26 22:23:42 SELECT * FROM $crypto WHERE crypto.reality != 'we know what we're doing' AND crypto.fact != 'Working PoC` ;  Result: $ICO: missing intrinsic value
787 2018-02-26 22:23:35 "We accept crypto" is the new "we take equity." Yawn, next.
788 2018-02-26 22:23:24 The CRYPTO END BOSS
789 2018-02-26 22:23:14 @Michael5SOS why did you get rid of crypto boy man
790 2018-02-26 22:23:13 Crypto friends, DM for an invite to a slack channel I just created so I don't have to share the same memes, news, and thoughts to 20 different people. :D
791 2018-02-26 22:23:07 Yes, $NXT pumped for a fork so people could get free coins. $ZCL is the same. A key rule of crypto - never fall in love with a coin, never believe too much in a coin. All over twitter right now are so many people saying $ZCL is going to the moon tomorrow. Think hard about this.
792 2018-02-26 22:23:03 boom boom boom
793 2018-02-26 22:22:58 brb gotta go change into my SHORTS lol
794 2018-02-26 22:22:57 Thanks will DM you soon
795 2018-02-26 22:22:52 welcome back
796 2018-02-26 22:22:49 If the broader philosophy of crypto is decentralized economy and trustless governance, SV with its dystopian hellscape of "socially conscious" NIMBYism stands opposed to that culturally. Seek the laissez-faire, you will find crypto there.
797 2018-02-26 22:22:28 He apologized for this already, where have you been? if youre keeping such close tabs on @PhilakoneCrypto surely you wouldve noticed.
798 2018-02-26 22:22:27 Need to carve out time to research/ read crypto white papers then HODL
799 2018-02-26 22:22:25 When my shit is handled, I'll be on a mission to over take twitter and YouTube, and be the biggest crypto social media personality. This hatred and fire is pure fuel today. Will work with no one and will be the best.
800 2018-02-26 22:22:17 This one I might see it coming. $NEO is going to be a hit.
801 2018-02-26 22:22:17 Yeah, at this point it's all about getting that BTCP, which I guess was the plan all along. I just expected ZCL to be valued much higher. Oh well, this is the world of crypto we live in.
802 2018-02-26 22:22:11 
803 2018-02-26 22:22:08 First official tweet ! Finally a reason to be on Twitter ... it’s where the crypto peeps are 
804 2018-02-26 22:21:54 can crypto boi come back?
805 2018-02-26 22:21:51 Depends on his understanding of crypto like a lot he may actually think it’s anonymous. Finding you have a tucked away investment that made 8 million and to your little understanding was “ anonymous “ I absolutely think he would try n finesse it
806 2018-02-26 22:21:42 Thanks for update.  I'm on the road and checking by phone.  Are we still in wave 3?
807 2018-02-26 22:21:23 Jumped onto $GVT double bottom on the hourly, 60% RSI, looks like a good setup. Target 26000 sats. Want to make it 4 good trades in a row today! $BTC #crypto
808 2018-02-26 22:21:21 I wish, but I don't see $XRP at $5-$10, maybe for a short period might reach $5, but that will depends on more on the price of #BTC at that moment. Ripple has a lot of tokens.
809 2018-02-26 22:21:08 Fuck whoever is saying that.  Your real followers and anyone who's gained something from your content knows the truth.  I am nothing but grateful for all the lessons youve put up as i know many of us are! Hopefully we can drown out the bullshit.
810 2018-02-26 22:21:04 You know you're into #crypto when your phone autocorrects "moon" to "MOON."
811 2018-02-26 22:21:02 You can’t really say “no exchange support” and then say “except one”

812 2018-02-26 22:21:01 Dummy
813 2018-02-26 22:21:01 whales are trying hard to push $zcl price down... just look at the fake sell walls, dont sell you will regret in a few hours

815 2018-02-26 22:20:55 Soooo many ppl called me in December asking for advice 
Didn’t post anything unrelated to crypto in last 2 months ...
816 2018-02-26 22:20:54 Google
817 2018-02-26 22:20:52 New trading strategy for this year will be sell half of my bags on a 2-3x ride the rest as free bags if I honestly believe in the project long term, otherwise if it’s a shitcoin, dump when the rest of the market causes it to moonshot. Need better risk management is all
818 2018-02-26 22:20:49 This.
819 2018-02-26 22:20:47 
820 2018-02-26 22:20:39 @circlepay said to have paid an estimate of 400m for #Poloniex #crypto exchange.  
821 2018-02-26 22:20:39 I won’t even like this one. This is ridiculous. Man you’re good. We have your back. Get your crypto safe and everything fixed. Don’t listen to haters.
822 2018-02-26 22:20:35 Crypto has started to stabilize so won't see HUGE returns. Plus many of the bloggers are high income earners so they can just stick to traditional equities. Some personal finance bloggers hate real estate too. Anything outside of a vanguard index fund is too risky.
823 2018-02-26 22:20:31 In my opinion.. once u have the bet set, u need to transfer funds or btc or whatever u r betting into an escrow, to someone both parties trust. Without money down up front it's all talk..

825 2018-02-26 22:20:20 If your crypto protocol is dependant not on keeping the key secret, but the protocol/algorithms secret, then it's not a cryptographic protocol.

This includes ANY gate keeping of the protocol.
826 2018-02-26 22:20:19 I guess nobody likes #trx ....????
827 2018-02-26 22:20:15 This is excellent news for crypto currency miners but I’m not totally sure why a gaming site is covering it.
828 2018-02-26 22:19:58  I get it! I understand why, just don’t think crypto conferences need to be held there! Haha I’m not a lambo fan but appreciate their presence brightening up my twitter along with moon quotes
829 2018-02-26 22:19:57 People say #crypto is highly volatile, but real crypto believers would say that the real volatility is in $. #changeyourmindset #Syscoin

831 2018-02-26 22:19:50 Oh give it a rest you drama queen
832 2018-02-26 22:19:46 Let's be honest...this pretty spot on. Could "@" a couple of people with paid groups right now but I won't...maybe we can all just celebrate their 1 year anniversary in crypto with a Bitcoin themed birthday cake...

844 2018-02-26 22:18:40 I delegate deep-level crypto stuff to others but I am discussing other topics (as you can see in the thread above)

846 2018-02-26 22:18:37 Don’t really care if the price goes up. Just want to create more liquidity in my favorite cryptos (remember ladies and gents, your crypto ain’t worth jack if people don’t use it )
847 2018-02-26 22:18:28 Youre the jim jarmusch of crypto streamers
848 2018-02-26 22:18:11 Exactly. Noone has ever given an answer to refute any of it.

Just attacks.

It's sad but not surprising I guess.

Sean will answer though... he's so sure that it must be easy for him to shoot through some proof...

Sean... ???
849 2018-02-26 22:17:53 @MarkYusko why bitcoin over other cryptos? Because bitcoin first to market? You have sold me on blockchain but is it possible bitcoin is the MySpace of crypto?

851 2018-02-26 22:17:38 True. Yet for a crypto asset that tracks oil 0.5% would be huge.

864 2018-02-26 22:16:25 WHAT HAPPENED TO CRYPTO BOI
865 2018-02-26 22:16:21 With all the $btcp and $zcl bashing (warranted or not) it feels like some imminent exchange support news could pump the price and really piss off some top buyer, short term bottom sellers.  Am I mistaken or isn’t that how crypto usually works?
866 2018-02-26 22:16:13 That's wisdom. You assets can never be imaginary and with no certainty.  #cryptocurrency is a wild gamble.
867 2018-02-26 22:16:11 Honestly probably gonna wait till my crypto wallet outside of ETH is worth a good amount and sell it and get a VR setup. Been wantin one for forever now.

869 2018-02-26 22:15:52 Ah es una cosa del trabajo. Nada realmente relacionado con crypto.
870 2018-02-26 22:15:51 I think Circle aiming becoming the number 1 platfor allowing people doing micropayments using crypto and exchanging with flat.Databases of both companies is really big and they are among leaders in both the sectors.Aadoption is coming
871 2018-02-26 22:15:49 Best possible action by the US gov't would be to do nothing & mimic the no-tax policy that Bill Clinton enacted 20 years ago related to Internet transactions. Don't tax crypto. A 5-year tax holiday for capital gains under $100K would be hugely impactful for implementation.
872 2018-02-26 22:15:46 I do too. Not because we are excluded by men ;) but because crypto needs to be mainstream and you’re right, it will happen. Us women want our lambos too

876 2018-02-26 22:15:30 been reading a lot of people say the big crash will be when btc is at $100k or something but nobody knows that. crypto could just as easily succeed in being a lower level investment for security tokens.

886 2018-02-26 22:14:44 @Bitcoin Goldman labels Crypto currency a "business risk" ..why? So they can start massively Buying Bitcoin at a low price? You know they are going to..just a matter of time.
887 2018-02-26 22:14:41 Why did you even bother speaking on this in the first place then...
888 2018-02-26 22:14:27 Its astonishing how many people do nothing but complain.  Crypto needs patience...if you have none, then you are invited to find something else to express your opinions...Stacey Dash is running for congress..talk about that.  Let the CEO do his job, he owes you nothing.
889 2018-02-26 22:14:17 And what will you do with the coins in the future? Spend them? Lile you're really gonna part your bitcoins after holding for years and which has appreciated in value exponentially on groceries and curtains

901 2018-02-26 22:13:27 I said it doesn’t help. Don’t misquote. Absolutely crypto conferences in strip clubs are excluding / tacky IMO. Love a good lambo pic  (I just prefer my cars without flesh draped all over them). Thanks! 
902 2018-02-26 22:13:11 Wow I would honestly have expected @bitfinex to react to this in some way... Crazy
903 2018-02-26 22:13:07 He banned because he is a pro crypto and saw how TRX was working maybe..

A smart business adapts technology which has available professional support to back it. 

And so far, the clear leader is Ripple.
912 2018-02-26 22:12:21 Crypto's successful future adoption lies within blockchain technology developments that add real life usability for future generations.

918 2018-02-26 22:11:29 I'm not even a cryptographer, so I don't know why I was asked to comment in the first place. (Quantum cryptography is very different from classical cryptography).
919 2018-02-26 22:11:23 We should have got in that business years ago.. you have the monopoly and no competition and yearly sales always increasing..
920 2018-02-26 22:11:17 I'm sorry, this is just completely wrong. This is not about unclosed customer tickets or some other mundane process scaling problem; this is about Ethical Bitcoin, and Circle being the worst actor in crypto, they go even where ICOs know it's unethical to tread. Appalling.
921 2018-02-26 22:11:05 ほげぇ、もうNo10まであるんやねぇ
922 2018-02-26 22:11:03 That’s why we have crypto?
923 2018-02-26 22:10:58 Stop lol
924 2018-02-26 22:10:58 That's like 99% of my game plan. The gap in knowledge between seasoned veterans and crypto rookies is huge. It's the grand freakin canyon. I know, I know, "DYOR", but guess what? It's not like they're teaching this in schools, and even the paid groups are yelling  DYOR...
925 2018-02-26 22:10:55 I also got greedy... live and learn i suppose. i didnt even want BTCP but i guess ill be picking some up now haha, unless there a big super pump tomorrow.
926 2018-02-26 22:10:54 I think generally women are much more conservative and view crypto almost like gambling. I would venture to say that Wall Street investors & casino patrons are probably male dominated as well. But I have no analytics to support this either.
927 2018-02-26 22:10:51 brutal lol
928 2018-02-26 22:10:24 and btw. I really really hope more women get into crypto. Actually do not even hope, it is going to happen, will just take a little extra time.
929 2018-02-26 22:10:10 this person is def crypto based on a cursory glance at their profile. Although tbf thats if you agree with me that american flag in banner + retweets ancaps = cryptofascist.

937 2018-02-26 22:09:32 Lol. The reason why I'm making this play is because everyone is expecting it to moon. Crypto never does what everyone is expecting. Do you really think everyone will be buying right up to the fork? No. $NXT dumped for 4 days prior to the fork. $ZCL is the same, even with bittrex.
938 2018-02-26 22:09:26 come on @BittrexExchange you can do it! $zcl $btcp
939 2018-02-26 22:09:23 In the US, if you have Crypto as 'an asset', how does the IRS value it?...at the minute you filed? If it's crypto, it's crypto in the UK and has no taxable value...unless you take it out as fiat
940 2018-02-26 22:09:19 TFW actually,  I'd like a musket tbh
941 2018-02-26 22:09:15 The biggest mistakes i made with Crypto in 2017 (only 2 months worth) - listening to shills, not trusting my technical gut & not grasping the implication of market cap enough i.e No your shit coin wont 1000x!
942 2018-02-26 22:09:05 Well the status went from “ PENDING” to “ PROCESSING “ now. Any past experience on the time from here forward ? I verified the blocks and they all match up and say Confirmed .
943 2018-02-26 22:09:03 crypto is fairly un-marketable to the average person. Here's what people probably think:

cold storage = so am I supposed to keep it in a freezer?
altcoin = alternative for what? maincoin? 
dApp = is it pronounced dap?
private key = are they going to mail the spare one to me?
944 2018-02-26 22:09:02 You fail to mention that XRAPID is still in beta test and closed to new participants as of now or how easily xcurrent clients can migrate from xcurrent to xrapid. Typical bearish tone on XRP. If you need help with with an actual researched article let me know.
945 2018-02-26 22:09:02 As soon as you "outsmart" the "guess machines" in Crypto you just make the situation worse. The whole thing is a blind alley
946 2018-02-26 22:08:46 Drone Rentals & services!
947 2018-02-26 22:08:37 When people find out I'm invested in crypto currency they think I'm crazy, which is completely fine. I'll gladly reap the benefits until mainstream adoption happens. We will see who's crazy then.
948 2018-02-26 22:08:34 Well... if some crypto guys going to strip clubs or post lambo pics (with chicks) is excluding, we got some serious conditioning work to do .

954 2018-02-26 22:07:59 1. Do less diligence 2. Do more deals 3. Make those deals in Crypto asset/tech class 4. Avoid waiting 7 years for liquidity

978 2018-02-26 22:05:35 This is cute. Good job, keep it up!

990 2018-02-26 22:03:59 Good luck guys!
991 2018-02-26 22:03:49 Posting this now so I can gloat about being right later; Facebook makes it near impossible to publish brand pages on crypto, or promote posts...they make money via ads, but they are not taking money promoting anything crypto...which means they will have their own coin/ICO in 2018

999 2018-02-26 22:02:42 same as with Cardano? 
1000 2018-02-26 22:02:41 Yes, since they do not conform to your opinion, they should be spoonfed crypto. By your own argument, men would also be conditioned to behave how they behave. So the current generation of "discriminating men" is no more to blame than current tech/finance uninterested women  
1001 2018-02-26 22:02:37 Hope it’s not crypto currency venture, enough people have been conned and lost money in other schemes
1002 2018-02-26 22:02:34 or 1btc.
1003 2018-02-26 22:02:32 he may not be satoshi but he's someone. He's getting sued for 500,000 BTC, no one other than satoshi and company could have that amount of BTC. Maybe a publicity stunt? I'm curious about his role and when he got involved as should everyone else

1011 2018-02-26 22:01:39 I think so too depending on what BTC does. I think I’ll wait till BTC decides what it wants to do. Someone corrects me if I am wrong but I see $VEN dropping just a little bit more within the next 24Hrs

It certainly feels like you have been informed about crypto for a while, were skeptical and perhaps now feel you missed the boat. Maybe you should put your mathematical mind to outsmarting the guess machines?
1015 2018-02-26 22:01:30 Şu adama sempati duyan, içinde bulunduğu crypto currency dünyasını sorgulamalı. Net!
1016 2018-02-26 22:01:30 Agreed.  But that doesn't push your agenda why $MWAT is interesting. If and when the market recovers so will just about every ALT.  And there are many that have survived this dip much better than $MWAT.
1017 2018-02-26 22:01:09 Exodus PSA  Watch out for accounts promising money in return for a small amount of crypto. These are 100% fake and are only meant to scam you. Keep your 's peeled and report anything suspicious!
1018 2018-02-26 22:01:06 there still is gold somewhere to mine, but it's really expensive operation. 
not like in the early days when you could just pick it up from dirt or loot from indians. 
isn't this situation somehow familiar rn?

1019 2018-02-26 22:01:01 If US China and Russia are jockeying for position with gold reserves you can be sure they have big plans for crypto as well, if only so the others don't get a big advantage. Bitcoin the only realistic option if true

1023 2018-02-26 22:00:46 Security is a big deal especially when it comes to the crypto. We sat down with our security partners to ask questions we have been recently getting. Read all about it here:
1024 2018-02-26 22:00:42 Question friends, does anyone have an air drop resource? Like maybe an active list or a calendar showing what air drop and when? It’s so difficult to keep track of these things. #crypto

1030 2018-02-26 22:00:19 So I’m wondering how I get into the rigged game of crypto. Can’t beat em then join them right ?  Maybe I’ll scam my own ico... how many people have knowledge to apply an AGI Bot to trade? Trading is just bs imo. Just random bs. Need to be able to turn a coin into cash in minutes.

1041 2018-02-26 21:59:59 Kind of telling, in every thread with every kind of different academic researcher or whatsoever cryptograph which jumped on the bandwagon to defend academic integrity and spit lava towards IOTA/CfB, they pull back when it gets interesting and to the point. Why is that so?

1052 2018-02-26 21:57:52 My 15year old: there should be a crypto currency called thoughts & prayers. Then every time there is a tragedy, the do nothing politicians would actually have to financially support the victims & community.
1053 2018-02-26 21:57:46 In the end they will hold the most crypto ... Thought crypto  was meant to give the power back to the people not make the goverment richer than ever before!
1054 2018-02-26 21:57:35 Hey brother! I am praying for you. If I can offer some helpful perspective maybe this is just an ABC correction for you and you are about to start an amazing third wave in your crypto career! Every Bull has a bear. You will bounce back stronger than ever! 
1055 2018-02-26 21:57:23 The only way he lost it is if he sold it...thats his own dang fault. I dont blame @CryptoBully for me being upsidedown in DRGN. Not outwardly anyway  Its obviously his fault for the price going down though

1074 2018-02-26 21:55:22 I looked over at some other folks project in my coworking space. they are working on a bidet design.

be thankful we have crypto.
1075 2018-02-26 21:55:18 @BigCheds Hey man, how are you? I've been following you since I got into crypto about 6 months ago and I've read the newbie guide like a 100x. It inspired me to start a project that I hope will help others too. Can you DM me? I want to discuss it with you.
1076 2018-02-26 21:55:00 Yep
1077 2018-02-26 21:54:54 No. In crypto, "practical attack" is very different from pen test. Because broken crypto means protocol is broken at a fundamental level, not just a code bug.
1078 2018-02-26 21:54:53 Soft fork: a change made to a cryptocurrency that does not affect its ability to interact with its older version
Hard fork: a new and separate cryptocurrency is made from an existing coin which cannot interact with the old coin, it independently operates

1084 2018-02-26 21:54:00 Because I’m seeing more and more posts with people asking teenaged crypto ‘investors’ to refrain from posting comments with the words ‘moon’ and ‘lambo’.  It shows lack of maturity. To have ‘moon’ in the name of the coin, well.....
1085 2018-02-26 21:53:59 what happened to crypto boi?
1086 2018-02-26 21:53:47 No. "Practical" in cryptography can mean finding collisions within a few months and investing millions of dollars. It's not the same level of practicality as pentesting. See e.g., what is presented in a conference such as "Real World Crypto" (a practical conference) VS "CRYPTO".
1087 2018-02-26 21:53:37 Which friends?

1161 2018-02-26 21:48:16 Not sure actually...  Maybe there are?  If the sec qualifies these as securities, which they are looking to, then it would fall under their jurisdiction.  Probably why coinbase hasn't released new coins as they need to figure out how not to break the law
1162 2018-02-26 21:48:01 Buy the rumors. Sell the news.

1165 2018-02-26 21:47:56 I believe TRON will have the most growth. 

More Room for growth. ALL about X's.

Tron is 5 cent.
Ada is 35 cents

So ADA would have to FINISH the year over 7xs higher than tron for ada to beat it.

Ex.. Trx hits $5.00 (100x)
ADA would have to hit $35.00 for you to 100x your $

1170 2018-02-26 21:47:25 Why isn't it bigger news that some states are now trying to except crypto as payment for taxes?
1171 2018-02-26 21:47:24 I’m sure Bobby did something.  He sneaky like that.
1172 2018-02-26 21:47:19 Cryptocurrency-focused financial services firm Circle announced that it is buying crypto exchange Poloniex. Circle didn’t disclose terms, but Fortune reports the deal is valued around $400 million.
1173 2018-02-26 21:47:10  thanks for the reply; I should pay more attention to channels/patterns being formed at the close of the candles rather than the shadows

Agree with pretty much all of the above, although an S-1 filing would seem like a stronger move for headlines than a strategic business decision.

1204 2018-02-26 21:43:47 >> Whereas investing in crypto is a negative-sum game: miners TAKE 18 million USD each day from investors, and there is no  wealth creation. Investors can only hope to take money from other investors.  >>
1205 2018-02-26 21:43:39 You did move it into a wallet already though right? Mine is stuck on an exchange  (ordered a ledger in December )
1206 2018-02-26 21:43:38 Ripple have 55 Billion XRP, and you think they don’t care about the price. 
1207 2018-02-26 21:43:28 A lot of crypto-fascist folks I knew were pro-capitalist libertarian nationalists who were anti-pan European and anti-state censorship (particularly in cases of national pride; e.g. an Austrian who wanted to be proud of the Austrian traditions without being pegged a Nazi).
1208 2018-02-26 21:43:26 I pay for more things with $LTC than any other crypto & @SatoshiLite seems to keep his head on straight. Hardly revolutionary, but it does the trick.

1210 2018-02-26 21:43:11 I can deal with a fiat to crypto tax, it's every other taxable event. Crypto is overtaxed imho.
1211 2018-02-26 21:43:04 you do realise for btcp to hit $500 it would need a market cap of 8bn dollars. No way is it twice as valuable as monero.. No way

1221 2018-02-26 21:41:48 Ehh looks like Bittrex is trying to things by the book.  Even if it is legal now, they realize future regulation would not allow this.  I think it's naive to not at least consider this.  They make life changing money every week, what is one coin pump to them long term? Pennies.

@asliceofmellon First it’s there, and second I didn’t tell Forbes; they pulled their estimate off a public disclosure IOHK did. Some of us fought to try to get off the list. The entire point of crypto is to not have to disclose how much you have

1275 2018-02-26 21:35:30 Fellow Crypto Nerds... Please be aware/keep in mind that if you purchase crypto in Robinhood, there is no depositing or withdrawing your coins, no protection. No private keys, Robinhood owns your coins essentially. It's like keeping your coins on Coinbase, except worse IMO.
1276 2018-02-26 21:35:28 They will get less because use of RippleNet will drive competition between them and drive fees down.

1280 2018-02-26 21:34:54 Bittrex can't not support the $ZCL fork or $BTCP can't have a future. It's pretty clear my vision.

That's not an H&S... that's a GTFO #nocoiners pattern !!!!!! 
#bitcoin trolling 
1288 2018-02-26 21:34:09 No men aren’t excluding women in crypto. Women are excluding themselves due to previous exclusion in the past 100 years in finance and tech spaces. Societal conditioning says ‘women cant do this’ so becomes self fulfilling prophecy.
1289 2018-02-26 21:34:01 I’m strongly convinced we’re going to 13k, I expected btc to hit 9.2k like 1 week ago and I was right, check out my pinned tweet, I don’t think we will see 9k Again.
1290 2018-02-26 21:33:59 Inside info???
1291 2018-02-26 21:33:57 Fair enough. Sadly, where the absolute number of people is the highest, the absolute number of shitheads will also be the highest. And the bitterness of the vitriol on crypto twitter reminds me of that on 4chan. Just stay strong please and ignore the haters.

1295 2018-02-26 21:33:35 until he has to put it on an exchange, how is anyone going to know if he owns btc?
1296 2018-02-26 21:33:34 If they support then you goodie

1304 2018-02-26 21:32:42 Maybe I was not clear, Bittrex is my supporting wallet.
1305 2018-02-26 21:32:29 haha idiot
1306 2018-02-26 21:32:15 great news for the crypto asset market... will bring improved infrastructure and pave the way for more institutional money to flow into the market
1307 2018-02-26 21:32:05 I love their exchange. It was the first exchange I used back when I got into crypto. I've always enjoyed it, but their customer services is definitely something that needs heavy improvements.
1308 2018-02-26 21:31:49 let me use #ltc as a base to trade the other crypto there, lower fees? not just #eth/#btc are more coins coming?
1309 2018-02-26 21:31:40 Good point(on burn rates not on crypto coin sales) #GodSaveTheTwitter
1310 2018-02-26 21:31:27 Will ltc btc follow?

1313 2018-02-26 21:31:06 Ok. So what if bittrex confirmed support? Or people decide to buy 6 hrs before the snapshot just like you. If you buy it now and even zcl drop to 0 you still make profit later with btcp. Don't try to too cheap. Profit is profit. You never know what way crypto is going toward to.

1318 2018-02-26 21:30:41 most calls from that date would have failed... zcl got swept up in the chopping.  the fork looks like it will go unnoticed. i'm holding through it at this point.
1319 2018-02-26 21:30:41 @BigCheds you are an inspiration bro. Sending so many positive vibes your way. You will kick cancer's ass, speak it to existence.

1321 2018-02-26 21:30:33 This is bad advice.  You most likely wouldn't have a chance to get them to a supporting wallet in time.

1327 2018-02-26 21:30:19 I started crypto a few weeks ago. I’d little knowledge of how wallets worked at time of fork & didn’t receive Litecoin Cash as a result. As far as I’m concerned @coinbase stole from us. In 2016 they created a temporary claim tool for Ethereum Classic. They can do it again in 2018
1328 2018-02-26 21:30:16 That's what I'm here for

1340 2018-02-26 21:28:49 I'll be offline most of the day today as I won't have much time talking #crypto bc I'm working an 16 hr shift today at the hospital. Oh boy ha!

1341 2018-02-26 21:28:47 Cryptopia is worse man.  Try sending another batch if u can, i dont do them all in one shot.  Theres a rush now to transfer them to thr electrum to avoid this exact problem.  Hopefully bittrex will do the right thing and this will be a moot issue but again, u will be ok

1348 2018-02-26 21:27:52 I used to run a website a long time ago... I stumbled across Bitcoin when searching for alternative methods to receive payments. I was basically looking for ways to circumvent visa... I was immediately intrigued.

thanks
1363 2018-02-26 21:25:56 It will be used to facilitate other crypto functionalities in the next year but yeah it will likely remain a commodity. The infrastructure it’s built on just cant handle the flexibility of other use cases
1364 2018-02-26 21:25:54 Crypto reduces the costs / friction associated with the inclusion of more signals, and therefore seeks to find a new optimal tradeoff between the reduced friction of multiple currencies vs the value of including more info in the distributed computation.

1367 2018-02-26 21:25:32 Agreed - as a programmer, I like to think I'm an objective person. People who do proper research on bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will see the merits of them & blockchain tech. If you're investing in low quality crypto, you shouldn't be investing period. It's about being smart.

1413 2018-02-26 21:20:46 Im trying to figure it out cause all my stocks are managed through my work.   However Kodak is in way over its head with the crypto thing its getting involved in.  A bunch of old guys who dont understand crypto are being taken in by a scammer with no chance of any profit.
1414 2018-02-26 21:20:29 It's election time in less than a month in Russia. Nothing particular about crypto has been said, only vague "new tech". Take it with a grain of salt (ignore).
1415 2018-02-26 21:20:25 Any word on XMR?
1416 2018-02-26 21:20:16 good question? (listyens) Nope, nobody even seems to know about it lest care. Only the Zcl holders are gambling on making arbitrage from the low price of $Zcl to the 'predicted' higher hope-of-a-price for $btcp. We people of #crypto need to remain vigilant to the many exit-scams
1417 2018-02-26 21:20:09 How much influence do CoinMarketCap really have nowadays, I know a coin that’s not being updated by them.  I mean there other indexes out there and one called livecoinwatch has updated.  Is it a case of too much work to get through, or a power trip? #cryptocurrency #Crypto

1425 2018-02-26 21:19:16 Some crypto understanding helps. The IOTA team was making unreasonable requests to the researchers, who kept getting back for more. Even the first email by the researchers is complete breakage of the crypto. The IOTA team kept moving the goalpost by redefining their desiderada.
1426 2018-02-26 21:19:12 Ha! Ok that’s news to me, makes sense to include this as an investment option I guess as it’s aimed at newbie investors that could have triggered interest thru crypto, but i thought the initial reason for adoption was the low barrier for entry to help everyday people invest.

1433 2018-02-26 21:18:32 I mean look at NEO they hyped the dev con the price went from $28 to $50 back to $33, QTUM with the 360 announcement $50 to $100 back to $50 there are dozens of these. In a bull market yes everyone is a genius, but don’t make risky and unreasonable calls.
1434 2018-02-26 21:18:15 Will you also be distributing $GAS for $NEO holders?:)
1435 2018-02-26 21:18:08 @aelfblockchain this crypto is the bomb

1438 2018-02-26 21:17:24 You've answered your own question mate, However whilst the crypto / gold space is bullish there's a chance to see it present additional opportunity to exit or take profit

1446 2018-02-26 21:16:23 Launch of litepay... poloniex bought by circle... proposal of tax payment by crypto... good time to be in the game
1447 2018-02-26 21:16:22 Kakaaaa
1448 2018-02-26 21:16:08 From this moment will follow Viberate and SunContract projects. I think there is potential.

1449 2018-02-26 21:15:59 Not sure if I'm doing this right... how the fuck do you use twitter??? @AhKoomii
1450 2018-02-26 21:15:58 Crypto isn’t and won’t be dead but it sure feels like trading on the alt market sure is dead

1452 2018-02-26 21:15:48 I am personally leaning more towards TRX
1453 2018-02-26 21:15:47 $NAS will have one day once blockchain goes through mass adoption, the amaount of data stored will be immense, therefore easy blockchain search engine = very valuable! I heard google is small company 
1454 2018-02-26 21:15:38 Second that 
1455 2018-02-26 21:15:36 Well i was pointing out that $VEN especially, your reward was a couple of percent and generally following a large news event in crypto. Like to buy after the event would have been better advice in my opinion.
1456 2018-02-26 21:15:35 $LTC will take off on that same fomo level
1457 2018-02-26 21:15:35 Je n'ai pas de #BTC donc en effet je ne risque pas grand chose ^^ En ce moment j'essaye d'appliquer les schémas "classiques" de l'analyse technique en effet sans rajouter la corrélation d'indicateurs, faire quelques pronostiques et continuer d'apprendre.
1458 2018-02-26 21:15:34 it took me 3h 10m today
1459 2018-02-26 21:15:31 Legit chart.  Fifth wave is risky.  Interested to see how this plays out.
1460 2018-02-26 21:15:31 U are u sending crypto to ppl you dont know?? Sorry but that is your own fault!
1461 2018-02-26 21:15:19 ahahahah
1462 2018-02-26 21:15:16 @googledevs @Google @googleresearch @googleanalytics - when are you starting a crypto exchange? Super profitable and people would trust you more than the current shady market offerings. #MakeItHappen
1463 2018-02-26 21:15:16 If my pulse mimicked $XRPs exchange values, I’m pretty sure the doctors would would have called it a flat line goner by now.  —- Just wait for the resurrection!

1465 2018-02-26 21:15:09 eth recent bearish weekly macd (seems like a decent signal in crypto world so far) so likely to continue being the weakest, also most of  alts seem correlated with eth a lot so btc should outperform most of alts too in the next weeks.
1466 2018-02-26 21:15:08 I hope this puts India in crypto limelight!
1467 2018-02-26 21:15:01 To simplify the work of users who are not experienced enough in the crypto field, we decided to develop the module of automated polls that will help to choose the most optimal individual operating mode with elements of the #ecosystem.

1469 2018-02-26 21:14:00 Go away! Nothing can compare to xrp digital asset,  and there is no other company in crypto that can compare to ripple and the team behind the company

1471 2018-02-26 21:13:52 But with Crypto Alex we make mad gainz and 0.5% is chump change  Imagine how many hoops to go from BTC over to oil. Sell BTC into Fiat wait for withdrawal, over to a bank then off to a broker. All within the scope of the taxman.
1472 2018-02-26 21:13:49 @ShaanVP I have some ethereum, so now I think I'll tell everyone in Silicon Valley that I'm a crypto-currency investor/ three stripe white belt / seed investor in all start ups you've ever heard of #techwoke
1473 2018-02-26 21:13:48 #REKT
1474 2018-02-26 21:13:24 You can see the change in mainstream attitude towards BTC and crypto moving from "it's a bubble/scam/overvalued" to "oh man if only I had bought some years ago!" Same thing happens with big tech stocks.
1475 2018-02-26 21:13:22 I don't  know if state growth never stops, for our democratic age it's true, yes. But crypto enables people more and more to govern themselves, we are still making baby steps and we will fall a lot still until we are able to walk.
1476 2018-02-26 21:13:18 Glorious!!!!
1477 2018-02-26 21:13:16 I wouldn’t doubt it if Central banks are buying $XRP, secretively...not wanting to sway the price. In reality, if such announcements were made public, it still wouldn’t have an impact...or so it seems.
1478 2018-02-26 21:12:57 Is it not a bit awkward??? 
1479 2018-02-26 21:12:52 おなしゃす
1480 2018-02-26 21:12:51 Technically it works. But the number of people willing to accept/pay in crypto is still very small. Also, tax gets complicated as many countries don't defined law on crypto asset yet.
1481 2018-02-26 21:12:21 Yep they screwed us, promising the card and wait until today to mention no damn card. No card no mass adoption.
1482 2018-02-26 21:12:15 Remember when everyones timeline was filled with crypto tweets and now there's 0? I like that.
1483 2018-02-26 21:12:14 Crypto soup Sunday....thinking the key word here is Sunday

Due to recent hostile actions by card issuers towards crypto companies, we have decided that offering LitePay card registrations at this time is imprudent

#LitePay #LTC #ライトコイン
1487 2018-02-26 21:11:44 Until crypto bros try to colonize PR
1488 2018-02-26 21:11:41 'From November through January, Circle Trade brought in more than $60 million in revenue'

So Goldman Sachs indirectly made millions from crypto trading OTC commissions.

This is bad, banks have already made enough money to be gaining from cryptos

1492 2018-02-26 21:11:26 @aelfblockchain Amazing how quickly the Crypto markets can pull themselves back together after a rowdy weekend!
1493 2018-02-26 21:11:20 There are no interviews to become a crypto trader.  All are already welcome.  Gender, color and creed are irrelevant.
1494 2018-02-26 21:11:04 These guys the worst. Who handles their twitter account. Go back to walk street
1495 2018-02-26 21:11:03 $crypto dark ages?
1496 2018-02-26 21:10:59 Meanwhile.... No exchanges. And when they do come. Major dump. I won't even bother. Worthless.

This is an ico done very poorly... Meanwhile your ceo is off talking about how to run a successful ico. 
1497 2018-02-26 21:10:49 Perfect .

1505 2018-02-26 21:09:44 Esperando y preparado  ver q nos depara el mundo crypto
1506 2018-02-26 21:09:39 From what I’ve learned is crypto currency is the new beanie baby. It’s a suckers bet. It’s  value is not based on anything tangible, nor on a monolithic institution like a government. Stay far away
1507 2018-02-26 21:09:14 Il n'y a que l'or, l'agent et les crypto qui portent mon intérêt. Bientôt, je me torcherai le cul avec des billets de 50 Euros.
1508 2018-02-26 21:09:10 Regulators accepting BTC / crypto are here to stay; similar to Japan and Korea authorities.

Worried about IRS and their tax money hunt?
1509 2018-02-26 21:09:09 I made profit from your ENJ call and don't take your calls as advise, but as suggestions. I also found your crypto essay about understanding the "bans" and Asian influence on the market quite helpful. Do not worry about that guy! He prob blames commercials for his food choices!
1510 2018-02-26 21:09:07 @NovaLendICO is looking awesome right now. High hopes #cryptocurrency #crypto
1511 2018-02-26 21:09:04 the people i know in crypto who have made a lot of money don't read charts at all. they have simply held on long enough for stuff to moon. day trading for pennies sounds like a waste of life.
1512 2018-02-26 21:08:59 Tether is the 2nd coin by trading volume (source of liquidity) and a significant part of all money that were invested in crypto market (up to 25% based on JPMorgan's analysis).
I don't think that a 70-80% price decline can be called a "healthy correction" in case of Tether crash.
1513 2018-02-26 21:08:53 Clearly RIOT needs to buy FIT for bodypowered crypto mining
1514 2018-02-26 21:08:52 No, but funny

1517 2018-02-26 21:08:32 The smart thing to do would be to take the insane 10X $ZCL profit and move on. Another BS coin....

1526 2018-02-26 21:07:12 Crypto is hyper volatile.  Everyone should be aware of this prior to thinking they can quit their job tomorrow.
1527 2018-02-26 21:07:06 What Robinhood did for the equities markets and younger demographic, this will do for the crypto markets.

Best guess, but makes sense when you add the pieces up... I think?

1530 2018-02-26 21:06:50 What if I told you that there is a coin whose odds of ascending are the same as a casinos odds in taking your money? 

Would you want in? 

Any guesses?
1531 2018-02-26 21:06:27 Everyday I am thankful for crypto. It almost brings me to tears how grateful I am for it. Also, grateful to have connections with crypto enthusiasts. PS: I am a half Croatian, half Serbian - Canadian, from former Yugoslavia. Sve naj bolje!

1534 2018-02-26 21:06:17 are we that desperate to think this is good? Maybe we will see the course up shortterm but in the long run average traders will loose. Idont want big banks taking over crypto

1536 2018-02-26 21:06:13 The big news behind @circlepay acquiring @Poloniex: Circle is backed by Goldman Sachs. Potentially a signal of confidence from the corporate financial world — but while this may drive general adoption, some in the crypto space are worried about the old guard stepping back in.
1537 2018-02-26 21:06:10 Bitches gonna bitch

1538 2018-02-26 21:06:03 Why don't ya just put a horse head in his bed...
1539 2018-02-26 21:06:03 I guess so. It's just weird to me that anyone who got into crypto post MtGox didn't know that they could see a huge correction right after they buy. Plus MSM has been warning everyone that "Bitcoin could go to 0" for about a year now.
1540 2018-02-26 21:06:02 That golden cross will quickly become a death cross if it doesn't break that resistance ASAP.
1541 2018-02-26 21:05:56 It was a sure bet.

Next announcement will likely be the release of Robinhood for crypto.

Portfolio tracker/management + seamless investing.

Trigger acquisition last year + this.

Seems extremely logical. Strongly inline with their original aim, back in 2014.
1542 2018-02-26 21:05:53 Are these "reasons you'll be able to share pretty soon" anything additional to the 020 digital shelves mentioned in last weeks update? Excited to see what they're like!
1543 2018-02-26 21:05:49 Yea something like adoption of one single currency aka crypto marks the end of the world

1637 2018-02-26 20:56:26 @Noahpinion Does it feel like a waste of time to have 127k tweets? You need to write a book or three to hit the big time. Tweets are great marketing but until you earn crypto for every read, you’re just the free content in the freemium model. I’m entertained but it’s evanescent.
1638 2018-02-26 20:56:06 That's the thing Rick, it takes an army to navigate the trenches of the crypto-currency landscape.  I don't see a Twitter handle for Bokke so please pass on my (our) thanks to everyone who contributed.

1643 2018-02-26 20:55:31 This is a great news for the crypto sphere. The legitimization of the step child by Wall Street and coming  to terms with crypto as a new asset class
1644 2018-02-26 20:55:31 Not tried it yet, will do today. Did you experiment with a "Withdrawal" yet? Depositing is usually easy, it's getting your crypto back that can pose a challenge on some of the obscure exchanges. I learned that the hard way on @Huobi_Pro

1646 2018-02-26 20:55:28 When u read that a big bank like Goldman Sachs has bought a crypto exchange

You realize the urgent need for decentralized exchanges
1647 2018-02-26 20:55:13 Stocks have something tangible to value. Metrics to show value like P/E. Isn’t crypto value just based on digital scarcity
1648 2018-02-26 20:55:08 Short term it could actually be useful. As it will further legitimise crypto in the eyes of people who have been told its a scam. Who may see it as a “safe” place to begin trading crypto.

1685 2018-02-26 20:51:45 I think the hardest problem I have with the crypto community right now seems people don't want to have their "top crypto" coexist with any other crypto... this space is big enough for more than one.  Just because I use USD for fiat doesn't mean that a Euro can't be used as well.

1694 2018-02-26 20:51:11 Yes, it is hard to believe when we are constantly told that the difference bank private money and crypto private money is that the banks are "tightly" regulated.

Its almost as though they are having a laff.
1695 2018-02-26 20:51:06 Well aside from entirely excluding 50% of the population and potentially disempowering them financially, this also limits crypto growth long term. If you want crypto to gain mass adoption, it needs to be adopted by the masses. Women included.
1696 2018-02-26 20:51:03 Hope everyone is doing well.  Apologize for lack of activity   Keeping up with med school and crypto world is daunting to say the least!  Look forward to diving in head first over spring break!!
1697 2018-02-26 20:50:53 a) Walking around...

1698 2018-02-26 20:50:52 its called a correction. We are stillup 5x since before the blood bath. Thats still great growth, corrections are needed. IT helps avoid bubbles. This coin was .24 early december, and .006 a year ago. It literally is the best performing crypto. get over it stop hating

1706 2018-02-26 20:49:55 Thank you

1709 2018-02-26 20:49:17 Yeah I think Ostrom's work, and more analysis of breaking down our typical dichotomous view of governance is crucial. Esp as people look at governance in crypto. Besides Blm/metoo etc movements. Also the gradients china uses for thinking about governance is diff too

1715 2018-02-26 20:48:47 it is also interesting to note that these laws have not been fixed. the banks are still investing in housing loan bundles. they do not seem to care if they fail they know the taxpayer will have to bail them out. we did get crypto currency out of this mess though.

1730 2018-02-26 20:47:44 Seems like legitimate entrepreneurship, and Poloniex is probably a great acquisition - for many reasons. The main ramps into crypto are all interesting ventures for seasoned sailors.
1731 2018-02-26 20:47:31 What about desktop wallets like @exodus_io ?
1732 2018-02-26 20:47:30 :D haha
1733 2018-02-26 20:47:25 Thanks for all your doing Frank. The SEC is targeting Blockchain and Crypto. Seems something stinks about this & they are trying to stifle an industry they could not control. I'd bet both the SEC and Big Banks are looking for their payout & won't let this new Tech go unregulated.
1734 2018-02-26 20:47:25 Yeah but the PM that I have lunch with tells me Tesla is sexy. So there is that.

1737 2018-02-26 20:47:05 There have been some amazing ideas flowing through crypto via these awesome projects we've seen coming to the surface in 2017.

But 2018 has got to be the year where these projects start to DELIVER.
and THAT should be the key buzzword going into #altseason
#Crypto
1738 2018-02-26 20:46:42 “Sorry, we only accept crypto as payment” 
1739 2018-02-26 20:46:36 i think the Fed will surprise and keep interest rates low so as not to rock the boat. low interest rates have also helped crypto flourish. something to watch for this year.
1740 2018-02-26 20:46:32 We'll be far out of the major downtrend channel we've been stuck in since 19K by that point, don't think we're seeing sub-8.8K from up there
1741 2018-02-26 20:46:26 It is not a genuine business offer. 
Stay miles from it. Instead, do your due diligence first. 
You will be shocked
1742 2018-02-26 20:46:10 Opening a brokerage account is barely more cumbersome than a fiat crypto acct. Can trade $USO instead of futures. Cheaper than crypto. Crypto commissions are a rip off: 0.5% round trip for a round-trip trade is insane. Bitmex is crypto only.
1743 2018-02-26 20:45:55 If I coat this little piece of misogyny in crypto wisdom no one will notice. I might even get girls to like my tweet...
1744 2018-02-26 20:45:50 Encore une fois, t'es incapable de structurer ta pensée.
Ta réponse est à côté de la plaque. Une démonstration par l'absurde: "T'es pas d'accord avec les propos de Marine LePen et Zemmour mais tu les adores et le revendiques".
Bref, t'es démasquée, une crypto-identitaire de plus.

What is it it with these crypto warriors!

1754 2018-02-26 20:45:04 monaco should be way ahead of all these other crypto cards
1755 2018-02-26 20:44:58 Next standard could be gold. Or crypto. Or (most probably IMO) both. Gold has the most stable store of value, but not if BTC ascends to be included in an official reserve asset basket. I don't think the probability to be 0, or even that far fetched in a USD meltdown scenario.
1756 2018-02-26 20:44:47 A Federal Law Enforcement Officer reached out to me and wants to discuss partnering on an educational project. He also wants to share his personal (not official) perspective as far as "The Law" and how that affects crypto. I'm excited!
1757 2018-02-26 20:44:39 I'm a fan of #TRX and secondly, #ADA. My friend is #ADA and secondly #TRX. My question?

Which do you see more potential and growth for over the next 1year, 3year, and 5year: #TRX or #ADA?

Thank you.
1758 2018-02-26 20:44:38 My advice... unless you really know what you are doing while trading, Hodl and buy the dips. When trading you are going up against bots built to burn novice traders.

1760 2018-02-26 20:44:22 Fair enough, day trading is tough work in Crypto as its 24/7. Been in it since june 2017. But long term invertor. Buy and keep a eye on.
When starting market cap was under $70B. BTC $2k, LTC $30, ETH $250 Little money went a long way.

1774 2018-02-26 20:42:52 Poloneix seems to be catering more specifically to the folks with big amounts money in crypto, so I think that they have more sustaining power. I would value them like a service business which may or may not be around 5 years from now.
1775 2018-02-26 20:42:30 I assume this is because they're not people who come from the legacy system of stepping all over anyone. Especially women. I'd actually really like to see what percentage of the crypto space is conservative.

1855 2018-02-26 20:34:53 The news feed is clogged full of fake accounts that appear to be trying to create a mass sell off of crypto currencies all saying the same thing. Seems someone wants a panic but why ? #Litecoin #bitcoin #bearish #fake #faketip #cryptocurrencynews
1856 2018-02-26 20:34:49 I wouldn’t say it’s dumping hard? 
1857 2018-02-26 20:34:48 He does this alot It always sounds like a vague muppets movie title. "Tron goes to space!" "Tron goes to manhatten!" "Tron family Xmas!"
1858 2018-02-26 20:34:40 Isn't the same thing happening with TRON?

1863 2018-02-26 20:34:14 I highly recommend using coinomi because you are like me. I don't sit in front of a computer to work I'm on the road all day and all night. Perhaps the suggestion of picking up a cheap Android phone would be a good idea. IOS isn't very crypto friendly
1864 2018-02-26 20:34:04 If you can explain it to a kid, you can explain it well.
Most people I try to introduce crypto to, end up getting confused sometimes.
They fear it and stay away due to lack of knowledge.
1865 2018-02-26 20:33:55 in this line of business, "legitimate" means "immune from serious crackdowns" hahaha $crypto
1866 2018-02-26 20:33:34 So much FUD with no facts.
1867 2018-02-26 20:33:30 Still Tons of new businesses accepting Litecoin every single day . Dont be bummed . All in time . Its happening . We are in the top 3 of ALL coins who business are adopting .!!
1868 2018-02-26 20:33:29 I think part of the problem is that EVERY article about women in crypto/blockchain is about how few there are and how hard it is, when in reality that’s only part of the story. We’d be more effective in building diversity in the space by highlighting the work of badass women&POC

1890 2018-02-26 20:31:53 Litepay still alows buisinesses to take Crypto, tutn it into fiat automatically without dealing with volitility, and st a smaller fee than CCs
1891 2018-02-26 20:31:41 LITEPAY IS DUMPING HARD RIGHT NOW. LITEPAY IS DELAYED FOR DEBIT USERS
1892 2018-02-26 20:31:36 Answer? We don’t sell our own PPT. Follow the Blockchain you will see that some PPT holders are still holding.
1893 2018-02-26 20:31:34 Sadly, LitePay sent out an email stating "Due to recent hostile actions by card issuers towards crypto companies, we have decided that offering LitePay card registrations at this time is imprudent." Little to be excited about, all they have is yet another merchant payment service

1895 2018-02-26 20:31:17 It’s time to stop saying “as.” You’re implying causation without any evidence of said causation.
1896 2018-02-26 20:31:15 I've found myself really driven to educate women, like myself, on just the basics fo #cryptocurrency. Sometimes the jargon is hard to understand and drives people away from ever wanting to learn about the space. I like to think of myself as being able to explain crypto to child.
1897 2018-02-26 20:31:13 Well I think I've made in #crypto because I have 69 followers and nothing beats that feeling. #cryptotwitter
1898 2018-02-26 20:31:12 Crypto doesnt play by weekdays.  It's evolved lol

1909 2018-02-26 20:30:02 Try to discuss crypto with at least one person (who doesn't already have skin in the game) per day. Dont necessarily persuade them to buy, just open a dialogue, educate and encourage self-research.

1934 2018-02-26 20:27:15 Many incumbents have created a system that does not serve many of us.  This isn't exclusively banks, or finance pros, or govts.

I don't see crypto as a weapon to be used against them, but as a life raft, whereby we can peaceably depart to a system of our own design and election.
1935 2018-02-26 20:27:05 Totally agree, many do. But I wonder how many women check with their husband before buying shoes- to use a horribly stereotypical example. I’m guessing not many. I think crypto will change financial narrative for women

His thoughts on crypto "I am following it very closely, and have yet to see any application that will fundamentally change things. I expect that to change in 2018." S/o my city.

2002 2018-02-26 20:18:50 Nano (Raiblocks) was the first crypto I knew before Bictoin but the thing I did not knew in that time was that no every crypto is fast, free and have any innovation. Nano is like the baby I've seen growing up.

2007 2018-02-26 20:18:28 Warning to new buyers, DO NOT take part in pump and dump groups!! They will rip you off, a friend of mine just lost a lot of money on a pump and dump scam.

年間の取引回数は
1500x60x60x24x365=4.7E+10回/年
470億回/年
手数料は最低10drops。一旦10dropsとすると年間消滅XRPは10x(4.7E+10)÷1000000 =4.7E+5XRP/年
発行総数1000億XRPが全部消滅するのに

or they just go after something completely diff that is merchant processing.
2071 2018-02-26 20:09:42 Both BoA and GS announced recently that they consider Crypto a risk to their businesses and today this.

2125 2018-02-26 20:03:53 How many women do you know who're doing Stocks or Programming? I would say that Crypto in some way is a combination of both. Reasons, why we lack women in this space, is a small interest in stuff like this and low-stress resistance. We need to provide simpler information.
2126 2018-02-26 20:03:51 And then they invest in crypto by buying poloniex through circle, always bet against Goldman.
2127 2018-02-26 20:03:50 C'est bien le problème. Si le grand public découvre les crypto grace aux banques (ou Etats/multinationales) qui lancent des projets dedans, comment croyez-vous qu'il va réagir ? Il va ancrer sa conception des cryptos en se fondant sur ce qu'en ont fait les banques justement.
2128 2018-02-26 20:03:45 And so far the gals me people I know try to introduce to crypto still only see it as get-rich-quick sort of thing. Which brings me back to my argument that interest is the most crucial factor in play here
2129 2018-02-26 20:03:43 Maybe we were late?
It said we would receive 0.3 BTC back if we were late, right?

Please reply sir?

Thought of the Day:

There's a global race on for which ecosystem is going to be the dominant home for crypto.

I hate to break it to Silicon Valley, but it ain't going to be there due to the US regulatory environment (even if they provide a lot of the capital).

2186 2018-02-26 19:59:47 But to buy futures you need brokerage account. Which for the layman is too expensive and complicated. Is there any commodities on Bitmex?

2202 2018-02-26 19:57:37 For all those who complained about the $VEN rebrand not moving the price, it's been a great scalping coin today.

2203 2018-02-26 19:57:36 Yes, Goldman-backed startup Circle buys #crypto exchange Poloniex. 
Funded, but Goldman doesn't owns it. Circle is also backed by Chinese giant Baidu and more. Doesn't mean full China support.

Its an interesting bridge, just hope now Poloniex can be not shitty anymore.

2258 2018-02-26 19:50:57 3 or 4 Crypto’s will survive over the next 5 years. #BTC #ETH #LTC #XRP
#Tron will not be one of them.
2259 2018-02-26 19:50:45 It’s obviously being done by Binance and TRX. No way this happens organically.
2260 2018-02-26 19:50:38 Haha amazing! Rain some down on us! 
2261 2018-02-26 19:50:34 Hearing someone say they are interested in “crypto” and knowing they mean cryptocurrency is a lot like hearing that someone is into “techno” and finding out they mean Skrillex

2267 2018-02-26 19:49:56 I was in a fab mood until dad had a rant about crypto currency and now I really don't want to be awake
2268 2018-02-26 19:49:52 so sorry narrow minded and callous people are hassling you today. much love to you and your journeys including this crypto one you are so generously helping us learn to navigate alongside you. 
2269 2018-02-26 19:49:52 
2270 2018-02-26 19:49:51 Any thoughts on their claim that they will be first regulated crypto exchange, even though tZero and Templum have already integrated blockchain tech with SEC-approved broker/dealers and ATS?
2271 2018-02-26 19:49:39 By all means have women’s industry groups. But pushing a narrative that women in crypto are being held back by men is reductive and damaging.
2272 2018-02-26 19:49:38 Well dude, in my case my wife follows you thru me lol we are a team. Hopefully there are lots of teams out there un our crypto community.

2291 2018-02-26 19:48:00 I never thought the cards were the news. I thought it was the front end app and merchant plug ins. We all saw the news with visa bitpay cards when it came out. Spoiler alert... Crypto is a conflict of intrest to anyone that wants to control and charge you to use your own money.
2292 2018-02-26 19:47:44 The truth is Bitcoin and Ethereum are enough to run the whole crypto world ..i said ethereum because it has smart contracts plus there should be another option if ones network goes down... all other coins are only gambling coins

2301 2018-02-26 19:46:33 Is there a rule specifically keeping them from entering the market? Or it’s just undesirable? Because frankly crypto is undesirable regardless of gender to some extent.

2307 2018-02-26 19:46:10 Turns out that today so far, your money would have grown more in #BTC at 7% versus the hyped #LTC at 2%. Goes to show this is a pretty unpredictable market even when the gurus seem to agree. Crypto typical. #bitcoin #litecoin #ltc #CryptoNews

2312 2018-02-26 19:45:53 You mentioned oppression. I mentioned barriers to entry, which are deeper than tech! Barriers are - perception of what crypto is, social + cultural beliefs / narrative around money + finance, disempowerment of women financially which still exists. Perception, belief, awareness.

2325 2018-02-26 19:44:48 Not really. 2.5.18 is when Visa and MC made public their views on crypto. Visa is more chill than MC, but the problem with Visa is those issuing the cards, not the company itself. Most likely some lobbying didn’t get done quick enough but Litepay still needed released so it was.

It looks like the forces that be are doing everything within their power to make crypto a tool subservient (not in lieu of/complementary) to the banking sector. We’ll just have to wait & see, I guess...

2337 2018-02-26 19:43:14 Their ideal seems to be a parallel crypto economy (think Darkweb). If there are enough people believing that something has economic value, then it does. There are already companies paying in crypto and giving out loans. No gov to bail them out but that's the risk they take.

2405 2018-02-26 19:34:57 Haha :D nonono, I'm holding a little bag already ;) I just like to keep track of my coins ;)
2406 2018-02-26 19:34:42 Cirlce kupujuc Poloniex je uplne amazing news a budem to sledovat zblizka. Konkurencia je fantasticka vec pre inovaciu. Opravte ma ak sa mylim, ale Coinbase mal doteraz viacmenej monopol co sa tyka instantneho kupovania crypto cez kartu
2407 2018-02-26 19:34:30 I think it will be between 30k-50k. 100k is to many impetuous.
2408 2018-02-26 19:34:25 Yeah im sure the admins on those forums are blocking women! Its almost like most women arent interested in crypto. Odd case.
2409 2018-02-26 19:34:25 Meh you can say the same thing about a fractional reserve system. You're under the assumption that they have to trade for fiat in order to purchase physical goods/services. If enough businesses accept crypto directly then the backing currency will not matter.
2410 2018-02-26 19:34:14 This is amazing!
2411 2018-02-26 19:34:09 I'm not even going to read this. No doubt the same bullshit rhetoric about how women are displaced by men but the real story is that the majority of women arent actually that arsed about cryptos
2412 2018-02-26 19:33:50 It’s crypto world, females will follow you not to see the chart but for your BTC       
2413 2018-02-26 19:33:49 What the fuck are you gonna talk about "shoeonhead, how meme markets affect crypto currencies and socio-political stability in third world countries"

2429 2018-02-26 19:32:11 I hope the people who bought a Lambo with #crypto money live somewhere they can get that baby up to 140mph + and maintain it on a regular basis. Tesla smokes it off the line with a family car. That just wouldn't look good. Would make the Lambo look like a Pontiac Fiero from '86

2431 2018-02-26 19:32:09 Same, been in tech and crypto for years and if anything i actually got further because tech companies are trying to diversify. Its a lot about how you present yourself and what you allow.  Of course discrimination still exists but no one has ever said shit to my face

2435 2018-02-26 19:31:49 No worries thanks. was just thinking if #Telcoin, and #TenX, #kucoin could be a good logic. Sorry I'm just a newbie thinking out loud
2436 2018-02-26 19:31:42 Lately I've been doing a lot of short term investments in crypto. No huge gains but making a little at a time. I would recommend if you don't know what coin to invest in long term
2437 2018-02-26 19:31:40 Not selling mine even at 30

2448 2018-02-26 19:30:20 The real question, on what basis does the current tax code cryoto-to-crypto exchange? Seems like a potential violation of the first amendment when we consider that taxing such exchanges, especially atomic swaps, essentially places a tax on messaging/speech/code.

2461 2018-02-26 19:29:11 How RankBrain Works And Why You Need To Know About Crypto-Currencies:
2462 2018-02-26 19:29:03 @WeissRatings obviously has now another assignment from whoever is paying them: "be nice about @Ripple, we're invested". Weiss, you have no credibility. You had yr chance. Lets hope a real crypto expert will try their hands on objective ratings. Not one that's bought like Weiss.
2463 2018-02-26 19:28:57 Sure it is a success in many ways, but as far as expectations for today's launch, it is a BIG fail. In crypto it is so important to do what you say. They knew about this debacle for weeks.. maybe months and didnt say anything. PR/Marketing in Crypto is so important.
2464 2018-02-26 19:28:54 Your mission is, and i quote ‘own mission in defending everybody's right to privacy’. Verge project is to give the user full choise in being anonymous or not through their Wraith protocol. Verge already succeeds in your mission. Please add it.@vergecurrency
2465 2018-02-26 19:28:51 One mistake around 6.5 minutes you said 380 thousand coins not million
2466 2018-02-26 19:28:39 I sure hope that is the case.  This definitely has not been as much fun as I was anticipating

2477 2018-02-26 19:26:39 same here....crypto is an empty space without y'all 
2478 2018-02-26 19:26:32 If they don't then we all know what their customers will be calling them from now on? Bittrex created unnecessary bitterness and delay.

2479 2018-02-26 19:26:22 Yeah, I'm out. I don't like these games. If it gets announced I may try to squeeze in cheap.

2483 2018-02-26 19:26:06 TA in crypto is bullshit at this stage. Draw all the graphs in the world. Bad news we go down, good news we go up. Unless youre a day trader its complete bs. If youre playing the long game all this ta = 0.

2487 2018-02-26 19:25:47 Lol wut?
2488 2018-02-26 19:25:42 he got hacked along with others in the twitter crypto community... seemed like he was targeted by pros. most of his tweets from that period of time look to be deleted but he did say he has regained his twitter last I heard and may change his model
2489 2018-02-26 19:25:38 @CryptoChoe Hey Eric, just curious have you tried BitcoinTax or CoinTracking and of the two which do you recommend/prefer? Or any other crypto tax filing apps/calculators you can recommend? Thanks so much,
2490 2018-02-26 19:25:35 What every trader learns the hard way.
2491 2018-02-26 19:25:34 Yes, Coz Goldman hates cryptos as everyone knows . Iol
2492 2018-02-26 19:25:28 7:23pm + so far we've already started (and beaten into the ground) $crypto twitter suits, and now Craig Wright lawsuit for $10 billion for forging signatures and stealing hundreds of thousands of $BTC, + possibly revealing that he may be behind #Bitcoin.

I love #cryptocurrency.
2493 2018-02-26 19:25:22 Guys, if you haven’t already, I urge you to sign up to @TheWhaleReports - very informative first addition hit our inboxes just last week! Great for newbs and experts! #cryptotwitter $BTC #Crypto

2502 2018-02-26 19:24:21 There must be something in the water because I've been pitched three different crypto-currency derivative markets in the past 2 weeks.
2503 2018-02-26 19:24:20 Awesome !!
2504 2018-02-26 19:24:12 @DougPolkPoker what do you think of the Goldman move. You see a big spike in the near future for crypto?
2505 2018-02-26 19:24:02 I actually had a website ask if it could mine crypto currency while I was on its site rather than turn off my adblocker.

2508 2018-02-26 19:23:41 Just wondering whats your thoughts on $kucoinshares #kcs, @360_trader ?
2509 2018-02-26 19:23:38 If you don't have good risk management and stick to rules you SET yourself and follow those rules religiously then you'll be eating by the sharks
2510 2018-02-26 19:23:28 Thank you guys I just tweeted this to litepay and Charlie. I knew 4 weeks ago visa withdrew a variety of crypto companies access to visa and mastercard this happened over 4 weeks ago .today's launch should not of happened the race is on for mass adoption who will win #ETN or #Ltc
2511 2018-02-26 19:23:23 Really hoping the annocment comes out right before the AMA tonight, can't see why they would hold an AMA without support and go through alll that negativity.
2512 2018-02-26 19:23:22 Most crypto traders were avid gamers before they found out about it (and many still are). In fact most have discovered it, be it through paying with BTC etc. It pays to be curious.
2513 2018-02-26 19:23:22 In my opinion this is a great idea, this company has great potential. You should look at this crypto currency. #BlockBankCommunity #BlockBankPreSale #Crypto #Blockchain #ICO #Profit #invest #Crowdfunding
2514 2018-02-26 19:23:21 Clint...this is just sad.  And what’s worse, it is too true.  I’ll be happy with some stability in the price, especially if it is around a buck.

2527 2018-02-26 19:21:28 About all major crypto TA's and bigwigs I've seen on Twitter have been predicting another downturn to 8800-9200 to hit soon. So regardless of Marius' standing here we're all standing by for the big, near-universally-FUDded- dip.
2528 2018-02-26 19:21:18 Bitcoin won’t go down below 9k ever again, 9.2k was the bottom, we’re entering a new leg, if btc breaks 10.4k I’m expecting 13k.

2531 2018-02-26 19:20:34 Same here.  Twitter makes your post available sometimes.  I thought you delete them
2532 2018-02-26 19:20:34 Well you are a crypto-fascist tech bro, so it makes sense
2533 2018-02-26 19:20:33 Hang in there, I'm praying for you....
2534 2018-02-26 19:20:11 Hal Finney was the real Satoshi. Every clue points to him..

2537 2018-02-26 19:19:53 Not once have I deleted a post, stop lying, and show proof, if you have a screenshot gladly post one that i have deleted stating we would be going down a few hours ago. A week ago I said we would go down 9.2k and I was right I think we will continue to go bull if we break 10.4k.
2538 2018-02-26 19:19:30 Very much enjoyed the interview Michael Oved did with @crypto_bobby. Thought it laid out a solid groundwork for why Airswap is necessary for larger institutional investors to enter the space.

2540 2018-02-26 19:19:22 It doesn't need to. It's a legal document not a reddit post. They don't care what he called himself on crypto forums. At some point you have to admit that 2 + 2 = 4.

2553 2018-02-26 19:18:15 I was gone for a couple of hours. Why is everyone wearing a suit ? I have to keep up with the trend :/
2554 2018-02-26 19:18:14 I’m still pretty new crypto March 2017.
2555 2018-02-26 19:18:12 Buzzkill? In what sense?

2559 2018-02-26 19:17:40 I would recommend the episode of @laurashin’s (excellent) Unchained where she talks to @tayvano_ about being a woman in crypto (among other things).
2560 2018-02-26 19:17:37 Now get to work!  This is crypto, we have no patients! 
2561 2018-02-26 19:17:32 100,000,000 etc supply vs 6,000,000,000 cko supply...1-1 is kind of overblown imo
2562 2018-02-26 19:17:15 @LitePayInc  @electroneum #litecoin #ETN @SatoshiLite most people knew visa withdrew services correlating to crypto over 4 weeks ago. Ken had a chance to confirm this yet litepay continued with this launch knowing this. Please don't let them ruin your work. This was like #XVG Nye
2563 2018-02-26 19:17:06 Crypto since 2016, what about you?
2564 2018-02-26 19:17:06 We mean proof of utility just like a lot of crypto they’re main goals have not been met so for now yes it’s a dream intill we see the utility working. That might soon happen with exodus.
2565 2018-02-26 19:16:59 What if he has to liquidate the btc to pay for the 10
Billion and dumps them? Btc To 10 Cents ?
2566 2018-02-26 19:16:58 $100 was the original goal, stick to it :D
2567 2018-02-26 19:16:48 Me also
2568 2018-02-26 19:16:36 Having @Goldcoin as a partner would do wonders for your bottom line. Think Kodak only with a real blockchain-based crypto born from the original! 
2569 2018-02-26 19:16:30 Nah it simply shows they feel threatened.
It's basically crypto nerds vs anyone but crypto nerds nowadays.

2573 2018-02-26 19:16:21 Kind of a problem. Manufacturers view crypto as a volatile market and aren't trying to increase production to match. There's a short term fix in the works, but if more and more people try to get in the cryptocurrency mining game, demand will still outstrip supply.

2588 2018-02-26 19:14:48 Well said @La__Cuen. Stupid articles are being spread to disturb the community harmony. My understanding is most in crypto (boys and girls) never even think or notice the so called ‘difference’ unless someone points it out. It’s just engaging people here, no divisions :)
2589 2018-02-26 19:14:44 Not spoke about Crypto for a 60 minute stream of some.

2632 2018-02-26 19:10:00 I think that the whole crypto market needs to re-evaluate the worth of @electroneum and not point at it ans say "Shit coin, no tech, fake mining" etc. People in crypto do not look at is the amount of partnerships we have signed and how many potential users they might have...
2633 2018-02-26 19:09:57 I certainly hope so, what a wonderful story. I’m surprised he has a handle on the subject aged eleven, it’s no small feat. Leading mainstream economists couldn’t even tell you the intricacies of crypto much less an eleven year old, kudos to the kid!

2635 2018-02-26 19:09:48 Hilariously, there are no 'black people of crypto' or 'gays of crypto' because those groups don't want to be part of a minority. They want to be treated as people. It's only 'the white women of bitcoin' that promote their oppression status.

2645 2018-02-26 19:08:48 Who told 'the men' about crypto? Because I was there in early days. There was no consideration of gender, besides the lamentation of nerds that women chose to engage in. (Rightly so btw)
2646 2018-02-26 19:08:47 Show me a "prominent security expert" who either a) doesn't have a clear conflict of interest or b) hasn't incorrectly used the IOTA tech, or c) isn't an academic fraud.  As a fan of you both, this is extremely disappointing.  Stick to what you hold and know.

2688 2018-02-26 19:03:59 1/ Traditional companies own land, because they need it to operate and as a hedging strategy. Crypto networks own tokens of their underlying protocol, because they need it to operate and as a hedging strategy

2709 2018-02-26 19:01:57 Here is a thought for you on that question. Treat stocks like crypto companies in the future that have shown profitability. Also. I trade anything that is showing the bigger returns at the time. Always adapt your focus.
2710 2018-02-26 19:01:51 People getting impatient.  Nothing new, really.  HODL and all will be good.

2720 2018-02-26 19:00:39 I seem to recall the 1080 was circa £600 when it first came out, but with crypto it’s up to £750 just now.

I’d almost be tempted by a 1070 if it was £350 (for my 1440p monitor, or my 4K TV).

I feel like it’ll be 2020 before 4K60fps is affordable and the crypto bubble bursts.

2725 2018-02-26 19:00:26 Issue with the contrarian argument is that it never defines clearly the segment in which consensus is defined. That's easier in public market but eg in crypto what does contrarian mean? In relation to whom?

2754 2018-02-26 18:58:03 Once legacy financial centers derive profits from crypto, one of the last dominoes has fallen.  Their reach and influence globally will ensure crypto not only survives, but flourishes. (e.g. CME/CBOE, GS-backed Circle buys Poloniex)

2794 2018-02-26 18:53:33 Yeah, speculation for $OMG is all across the board. $100-$350 in 2018. But there is a consensus for a 3-digit OMG value on the horizon regardless.
2795 2018-02-26 18:53:27 There continues to be a lot of FUD in the community comparing $XRP as a PND coin similar to $TRX and controlled by the whales. Speaking for myself and probably many others, are these claims correct? If not, can you provide any comfort for us investors?

2827 2018-02-26 18:49:12 Why is withdrawal of paccoin from yobit off? Do they want me to loose the coin or they are going to swap automatically?
2828 2018-02-26 18:49:12 I always thought we need specialized localized decentralized cooperative currency, such as those used by China before its liberalization, and @Sardexnet in Sardinia after the Euro crisis. Crypto$ makes it formal, safe, reliable, and convertible.

2830 2018-02-26 18:49:06 Thank you Haejin, please don't forget to help us signal overbought conditions to raise cash as in Beginning January we only talked about next degree trends (3 months away) and there was no comments of overbought conditions and we were left frozen not raising cash. Thx you Haejin.

2832 2018-02-26 18:48:55 Indian exchanges trade volumes at mere 1k BTC, hope you make it ~50k (like coinbase), then India is launched! 
also hope you guys make Crypto/WRX pairs available for trading! won't that be awesome!?
To the moon!
2833 2018-02-26 18:48:48 Maybe you should look for the “Silk Road” US govt. got a lot of crypto
2834 2018-02-26 18:48:45 Looks like you didn't go through the rumored searches for Crypto @ TSA?
2835 2018-02-26 18:48:43 2 - willing to endure it succeed, until the playing field is level and things are more standardized. 

The rhetoric around crypto evolves in private Discord / Telegram groups.
2836 2018-02-26 18:48:41 Yeah. It’s hanging out in the middle zone. I hope this year brings big OMG gains.
2837 2018-02-26 18:48:39 All this talk of the flappening and I'm just here thinking that I thought we all always knew Bitcoin Cash was a trash tier crypto? Just me? #crypto
2838 2018-02-26 18:48:22 1- When I was first getting into crypto, I had to endure countless groans, mansplaining and talking down to. Getting through that was hard, but I think it mirrors women’s discrimination in the workplace starting from the early 1900s. Only the small percentage that are...
2839 2018-02-26 18:48:13 if anyone tells you they've never done it they are a dirty liar.

2842 2018-02-26 18:47:50 Crypto is too exciting to waste time with such non profitable arguments

2850 2018-02-26 18:47:14 Uzbekistan government to produce crypto regulation plans by September 2018, God willing
2851 2018-02-26 18:47:13 great news for the crypto space...brings improved infrastructure and paves the way for more institutional money
2852 2018-02-26 18:47:04 Looks like I'll be attending @show_crypto in London in a few weeks. If any of my copiers or followers want an excuse to come meet me this is a pretty good one. Tickets aren't too expensive either.
2853 2018-02-26 18:47:00 Nope
2854 2018-02-26 18:46:53 Was ready to go on and say that crypto is still in it’s infancy, and once it mutures will become stable and therefore more usable but after that reply... that’ll do us
2855 2018-02-26 18:46:43 Not sure of the how exactly.  this entire debate is about where the confidence boundary lies, and how close we should allow ourselves to get to it.  Birth of crypto and rising populism suggest we’re already getting close

2866 2018-02-26 18:46:09 What is your ideal “gender ratio”? 50/50? In every industry then? What is the issue if women don’t naturally gravitate towards Crypto of all things? Should more men be pushed to be nurses & social workers?

Freedom for women pursue these things is there. We aren’t in North Korea.
2867 2018-02-26 18:46:08 covesting, siginals one just came out today, can't find it. But realistically, by the time institutional money comes in the market, so many investor platfroms will be out... too croweded. GVT may be on top though... huge money in the projects that are successful.
2868 2018-02-26 18:46:05 At least it’s going to be accepted wherever Visa is accepted? Also the cards may come out later. But I believe everyone was expecting more today plus a big pump. The day isn’t over so we’ll see.
2869 2018-02-26 18:46:00 You all are missing the point of crypto and the thing that is currently happening will break.

Not feeling good about crypto short term... (Unless you are keep walking blinding through the labyrinth anyways...)

2879 2018-02-26 18:45:30 And that's why you're one of the most respected guys in the #crypto space! Excited for your telegram channel!
2880 2018-02-26 18:45:20 @AcademicAgent i know im a bit late to the party but what are your thoughts on the crypto currency phenomenon from a economists standpoint
2881 2018-02-26 18:45:10 Coin of the day.

$suit. On $crypto twitter Suit coin is hot, but also in a downtrend. Suit coin is for those who actually have interest for things outside moms basement. Therefore it really needs to complete that inv H&S to stay bullish. Stoch looks good and MACD primed. EW = up
2882 2018-02-26 18:45:08 Thanks. Another argument to get my daughter involved in crypto.
2883 2018-02-26 18:45:03 We buy gold for many reasons—as monetary insurance, a crisis hedge, and even for simple diversification. And another one of those reasons is coming to the fore right now: as a hedge against overvalued stock and crypto markets. #gold #silver #preciousmetals
2884 2018-02-26 18:44:58 And thinking about it, this law suit that's been filed against Wright may be the precedent for future crypto asset ownership proceedings, specially regarding evidences and how are they presented before the court.
2885 2018-02-26 18:44:50 Debitum Network will always maintain high ethical standards and will make decisions considering their consequences for DEB token holders and crypto community.

2887 2018-02-26 18:44:46 If you bought $BCH or $BTC 24 hrs ago, right now you are up 9% on you high risk investment.

You deserve it, for taking a chance, and believing in crypto. Real money.

 
2888 2018-02-26 18:44:43 we also have a telegram chat where I invite people that post good pictures/are helpful in the community/spread the word/are good cooks
2889 2018-02-26 18:44:36 Awesome. I look forward to your videos and shills of the week. Great content and insight. I'm bullish on VEN ICX BLZ QASH KEY POLY AST NAS. I'm hoping my due diligence and lack of sleep the last few months pay off.

2895 2018-02-26 18:44:05 So the argument is that Focusing on an elite minority of women in crypto is more equitable than highlighting the low engagement of women overall in the industry?
2896 2018-02-26 18:44:02 This is a really great wallet! The ease of use really takes crypto asset accessibility up a level, which is vitally important as we climb the adoption curve and bring in less tech-savvy users.
2897 2018-02-26 18:44:01 There are more men who pretend to be women in crypto simply for followers than there are actual women. It's sitting on a silver platter for you, ladies.

2902 2018-02-26 18:43:42 @demorgen jullie berichtgeving over crypto is bedroevend. 
"Nieuws" van >3 dagen oud, plus termen door elkaar halen zoals  bitcoin of ICO of Ethereum... , u haalt duidelijk uw "nieuws" van de scamsite bitcoindotcom  die door bcash bonzen wordt aangedreven. triest niveau

2904 2018-02-26 18:43:38 That sounds great Jake - I’d be thrilled w 5X - but I’m an oldie and even 2X would be better than any other investment I’ve seen. The ROI in crypto is unparalleled! I’m a huge fan Jake - maybe I’ll cross your path in May in NY.
2905 2018-02-26 18:43:35 Good day. Your support email line does not reply. I would like my reservation of 2fa. I have got no assistance for 3 weeks
2906 2018-02-26 18:43:33 you really thought people were going to start spending litecoin on day 1?  Most ppl are hodling anyway - this is a step in the right direction for adoption.  Merchants are a critical component
2907 2018-02-26 18:43:33 Have you invested in crypto currency?
2908 2018-02-26 18:43:31 Yeah it gets old real fast lol

2936 2018-02-26 18:39:51 litepay opens at 9pm today for merchants.  thats a good thing
2937 2018-02-26 18:39:49 Since I have been focused on crypto trading, fines such as this, for ignoring "protected" quotes, seem kind of "quaint."   In crypto, markets are CROSSED over 90% of the time, with many occasions that bids exceed offers by wide margins...
2938 2018-02-26 18:39:42 Coiners hate bankers sooooooo.....I see a major push towards decentralized exchanges, peer to peer trading without a middle man.  Isnt that what crypto is all about?  No more fractional reserve exchanges!

2960 2018-02-26 18:37:38 If you really want to help the teachers   financially, pay them in deflationary crypto currency rather than debt based federal reserve notes...
2961 2018-02-26 18:37:32 lol well if they are suing him, its because they think he's satoshi for starters
2962 2018-02-26 18:37:28 If you’re a Blockchain conference and you don’t accept crypto as payment for registration.

Are you really a Blockchain conference?

2965 2018-02-26 18:37:06 It's going this while simultaneously mangling the GPU market. Crypto needs to back off.

2969 2018-02-26 18:36:52 @OddStockTrader  helluva call on $ZCL last week!  U mind sharing your mindset?  Why'd u think it was gonna tank days before the fugggn fork?
2970 2018-02-26 18:36:52 I think because they traditionally like to do things that have been proven true so they think they are right

However crypto is one of those things we don’t know yet how it’ll turn out

So it’s too big of a gamble to risk reputation as well as money
2971 2018-02-26 18:36:40 Unless you pick the absolute bottom in a bear market you will lose value - Jake is spot on as the upside is awesome. I spent 100k in last month and am down 10% - meaning 10% off bottom. That’s a good position as my risk is about 10% - upside will be greater!

2986 2018-02-26 18:34:39 the card is more about a means to mass adoption to get the average person into crypto. They need a means of transaction that they are familiar with and trust.

2989 2018-02-26 18:34:18 Vous ne comprenez pas où je veux en venir. Les banques éjecteront ou  marginaliseront les coins décentralisés et mettront les "leurs" à la  place. Et elles marketeront ça en faisant croire au grand public que les  crypto sont toutes comme ça. XRP est un bon test pour elles.

3004 2018-02-26 18:32:05 @investdecentral what resources do you use to learn how to read chart trends. Do these differ from traditional stocks or do crypto stocks follow the same trends?

3016 2018-02-26 18:30:51 Absolutely.  These are all great for the crypto-currency, Fintech, and IoT space, and all in which  @Ripple has its' glial cells entrenched. When the block chain neurons begin to fire, Ripple and #xrp #XRP will light up like Times Square.
3017 2018-02-26 18:30:40 Wars probably came before banking. Both systems have evolved greatly. Compare war (centralized violence) and violent video games to central banking and crypto. See where things are going? The only thing necessary is change.

3022 2018-02-26 18:30:18 I find your perceived value of litepay to be flawed and incomplete without any valid, factual analysis to support. This about more than just the card for purchasers. So your own reply (to borrow your own words), "...basically it is worthless."

3031 2018-02-26 18:29:37 Peter @whatbitcoindid McCormack:

Investing in Crypto is a calculated bet on two things:
1. The acceptance, integration and normalisation of virtual currencies as a store of value and medium of exchange alongside traditional fiat currencies
3032 2018-02-26 18:29:35 Only people with good entry gains. It's a typical game in trading buy the rumor sell the news. You better buy the dip and hodl.
3033 2018-02-26 18:29:17 Some times I feel like using most of my crypto gains to buy the best PC and monitor money can buy.
To blow my money and game it away.
But then my rational mind takes over and remembers the future still exists.
3034 2018-02-26 18:29:15 Patiently waiting to pass your bags of shit to a newbie - gain an itch and loss a mile. Stop destroying the crypto ecosystem.

3036 2018-02-26 18:29:10 “Tokenization” simply means: use existing technology to make securities work better. 

They also provide the pathway for compliant participation in the Crypto Asset world. 

A huge opportunity and extremely early IMO. 

What it will ultimately look like is still being determined.

I also have a jar full of twenty pence pieces and am wondering if silver is worth a punt at present?
3041 2018-02-26 18:28:40 Strong hands will prevail in this case. If you are in crypto and aren't better off in 3 months, you are doing it wrong.

3043 2018-02-26 18:28:31 Over 400m... cmc needs updating. Bare in mind each franchisee has to lock up a minimum of 100k tokens to qualify.... thus reducing freefloat the bigger the business grows  $MWAT

3047 2018-02-26 18:28:05 That co has 800M assets under mgt that is more than enough to be publicly traded.

3056 2018-02-26 18:27:34 most important advice in crypto
3057 2018-02-26 18:27:33 I think security coins are going to be more popular in the future. Specially after SEC starts adding regulations to the Crypto market. Can you please do a review on Polymath?
3058 2018-02-26 18:27:33 Don’t see it happening, unless it is a pure crypto exchange. Any fiat connection means regulation means dinosaurs like CB will stay around for a while.

3070 2018-02-26 18:26:35 Hey @ruthheasman is here  crypto is the fastest way to lose everything you have. It's critical to get in with lots of research and fear of losing everything. If you're not into the tech and ideals you need to rely on a very trusted source to inform you. Following profits = rekt

3072 2018-02-26 18:26:30 I thought about starting up a shop myself but I rarely ever see people wearing crypto stuff out in public outside of actual blockchain events. I think people either are ashamed to associate with it or they don't want to advertise they own crypto to potential muggers.

The more we fight the harder targets we become! #trx #xrp #eth #btc #rdd #xvg #ltc @justinsuntron @CryptoChoe

3098 2018-02-26 18:24:36 Which may turn out to be not so bad they haven't been bashing crypto more open to it. Depends what they do, exchanges are in for a hard time. Alot has happened recently with DEX, atomic swaps, eth-dogeERC20 bridge.
3099 2018-02-26 18:24:36 Like anything cryptocurrency related.. Boundaries are unknown. I am excited to see just how far Litecoin can go in the coming months with Litepay being activated and changing the dynamics of the crypto world. Anything is possible.. #LTC #Litepay #Litecoin
3100 2018-02-26 18:24:29 Finally had a merchant processor admit @Visa isn’t allowing merchant processors and crypto because they are afraid. Your damn right you should be scared because you pissed me off and just created your biggest competitor. I’m on a mission. #LiteCoin #LitecoinFam #PayWithLitecoin
3101 2018-02-26 18:24:12 Over the years Cliff has always had 8's like (688, 888, 13,888) show up as a benchmark in his reports. He has commented that the crypto's favor 8 for some reason. Cliff, are you referring to 13,888 or another Target much higher than that?

3103 2018-02-26 18:24:00 So #Bitcoin eh? Bubbles eh? Unless you’ve been living in a Wi-Fi-less bunker you’ll have seen plenty of coverage on the Bitcoin phenomenon over the last few months. MD Jamie Simmonds tells us how it is. #blockchain #cryptocurrency #crypto #ICOs #altcoins

3105 2018-02-26 18:23:40 Follow @CryptoCred he has a bunch of free resources teaching the basics of charts.
3106 2018-02-26 18:23:24 Lord, send us a bull run. For we have had enough time to buy the dip and those who  missed out are not worthy of thy exhilarating MA divergence.
3107 2018-02-26 18:23:21 あっ、それは、残念です(´・ω・｀)
羨ましいです、一人寂しい(´；ω；｀)

3109 2018-02-26 18:23:17 I am starting to realize that you can’t take people on twitter seriously. Some know what they are talking about & some have no clue but act like they are the experts. It’s quite funny actually.
3110 2018-02-26 18:23:16 Brother , can you do an update to icx , please thanks
