58 2018-05-28 23:52:35 “Bitcoin bubbles” aren’t a thing. This is an emerging asset class and of course it is going through natural fits and starts. 
Crypto is basically zero in the scheme of the $300T capital markets.

You are already loaded with $$$ like many of the guys trading crypto since 2013. The newbs though that started in 2017 are right to cut the losses or lockin the profits and buy when the bear market is over. And that can be 1 year away

62 2018-05-28 23:50:43 I'm getting more and more nervous of an extended bear market like 2014.

"But crypto is too main stream now"

It actually makes MORE sense to have an extended bear market because then big institutional buyers and whales can accumulate even more #bitcoin at cheap prices.
63 2018-05-28 23:50:24 How is adding more followers to your count lifting up the crypto community?
64 2018-05-28 23:50:21 Kringles are the smallest change of the crypto-currency TBC.  

0.00000001 TBC = 1 Kringle.  

The way you can calculate the conversion of Kringles into TBC is by dividing the Kringles by 100,000,000 to get the TBC equivalent.  100,000 Kringles divided by 100,000,000 = 0.001 TBC.

68 2018-05-28 23:49:30 My predictions have been 100% accurate. I've been calling btc to be between $0-10000000 and I have always been right. You can't set your targets as bands that are the size of %50 of the value of the currency and claim you were "right"

128 2018-05-28 23:36:42 When the dot com bubble popped, stocks lost $5+ trillion in value.

Today the crypto market cap is less than $400 Billion.

The real crypto bubble won’t happen until there is at least $10 trillion worth of utility token market cap.

It will be unlike anything we have ever seen.

148 2018-05-28 23:32:20 Any specific thoughts on why it will pass (if true, which I doubt)? If these people are actually controlling the price of a currency, why would they ever stop? Even then, if crypto price can be manipulated by the rich, how is it any better than FIAT?

154 2018-05-28 23:31:09 Tried this approach 1st, and it did roll back the OS (way back to Windows 10 build 1509 ) ... not sure if it's the old build or the files that it copied over from the later build, but every time I tried to mine my rig froze ... going for complete wipe and restart now ...
155 2018-05-28 23:31:07 Yeah, price is a big issue. Even on the BCH side as no one is going to use something or hold onto something that is volatile in the downward direction; only if it's constantly going up. It's not the merchants that are the only problem it's the holders/users of the crypto.
156 2018-05-28 23:31:04 Wow that's nice! When does this offer end?

190 2018-05-28 23:23:59 Liquidated 50% of my crypto holdings into the true store of value...good ole usd. Not convinced 7k or 6k supports will hold on $btc mid term. Looking for end of q3 for recovery and for 2019 to be a potential repeat of 2017. Until then..

195 2018-05-28 23:23:19 Where to next?
196 2018-05-28 23:23:07 what is this?
197 2018-05-28 23:23:03 Thoughts: The Stock Market has been stagnant for months awaiting 2018 Midterm results.

Prediction: If Dems win a majority of seats, the baked in price in the Stock Market will plummet.

Crypto: Same but with new Bull Market in Late November if Republicans maintain control.
198 2018-05-28 23:22:52 After 5 years I thought I was a hot shot...now after 20+ years, I'm still only improving!
199 2018-05-28 23:22:17 I can’t even celebrate #MemorialDayWeekend2018 in peace without #crypto dumping
200 2018-05-28 23:22:10 @2zMax @HeroBullDog well is not like i dont do that already in crypto trading lol
201 2018-05-28 23:22:09 A month ago, i said multiple times do not FOMO into the price, because it was clearly a bull trap after we went up with $1,000 in less the 30 mins. People were trash talking and replying with comments as "missed the boat?"

Well, no wonder the #crypto market is easy to manipulate
202 2018-05-28 23:21:53 Yea but we went through 4 months going on 5 worth of shorting. The rest of the crypto world went to make long term wealth money already.
203 2018-05-28 23:21:30 It seems to me that #crypto prices are being driven down by a class of older investors that are betting that more #millennials will sell as the bear market continues because #millenials are impatient. Are they wrong? IMO, (enough) millennials have already proven quite resilient
204 2018-05-28 23:21:24 @ProfedeOfficial This is one of the best crypto projects of the 21st century! I hope they won't let me down...

208 2018-05-28 23:21:06 You are trying to make a point for crypto but you are wrong here. This is just a girl not wanting to be handcuffed. I wonder what happened before the video started. Not a clear view of the whole scene is given. People already making false claims
209 2018-05-28 23:20:27 TIME is the key component to investing in any market. Keeping that in mind, the correct thing to do is place your bets when the market is at its darkest. Crypto will win overtime, make sure you’re positioned to take advantage when it does.
210 2018-05-28 23:19:56 So?
211 2018-05-28 23:19:26 dont worry clif. there will be enough suckers to find a living in cyper space. your fans in silver and crypto spaces will miss you.

213 2018-05-28 23:18:56 seems to me the more important variable is between crypto and fiat. if ppl moving out of fiat into crypto then the whole crypto pie gets bigger.  ironically, Trump may be bad for crypto in that he is resuscitating the fiat world from debt collapse, thus, crypto pie not growing

271 2018-05-28 23:09:29 I agree but you can only fleece noobs so many times. They were fleeced at 20k and on down for last 5 months. I have friend who got in last year at 3k. He’s rode up and down making money but tired of the bullshit and the swings. I’m just saying it’s not very inviting for new $$$
272 2018-05-28 23:09:06 採掘しているのは確かなのでポンジとは言い切れません。また去年新規参入は，一時期，新規登録に制限が掛かるくらい激増しました。ポンジなら，新規参入が増えれば潤うはずです。だからポンジではないでしょう。採掘量が減り，減った配当を多人数で分けている状況では？巻返しに期待。#BitClub

277 2018-05-28 23:08:13 Ive decided to keep quiet to all my nocoiner friends and family on fb since they either dont care or think its crashing to zero. But im quietly working, every day, 10 hrs a day in crypto. Ill speak again when im crypto rich and travelling around the world, posting pics.

280 2018-05-28 23:07:28 Hey genius , suggestions on good shitcoins with similar reach as Verge , is welcome. Go ahead and throw some. Enlighten us on why it’s better compared to Verge. If you are not invested in Verge why fucking cry?

284 2018-05-28 23:06:59 Lets better hold the line now, it looks really bad for BTC and the whole crypto market, market cap way below 300 bilions, so is it the bottom now or 250 is more likely :-/

318 2018-05-28 23:01:49 Isn't this the same island that is issuing 24 million coins and giving 12 million of those tokens to a team of 5 from Israel for developing the currency? I support the enbracement of the crypto space, but that is not a good idea to do that.

344 2018-05-28 22:58:30 It really is so true! How many people were pulling out their phone to show family members how much  they were making trading crypto in Dec? 

How many wish they had heard this advice back then and stopped & said, maybe I should take some profits off the table. Great advice!
345 2018-05-28 22:58:18 Same goes with crypto. Hard forks software bugs etc for example.  Have to def keep in the loop on the news hourly.  Changes faster than one can blink it seems.  :)

365 2018-05-28 22:55:20 From what I gather from crypto twitter, if you are able to make gains during a bear market, you would make a killing during the bull market. It would be interesting to test this theory out. Maybe after a sub $4k bounce... assuming we hit there  #BTC #LTC #ETH #ADA #BNB

378 2018-05-28 22:53:27 If BTC cracks 7k, judging by the current state of Crypto Twitter, I predict anger. If we crack 6, out and out despair.
379 2018-05-28 22:53:21 2. - if actual circulation is 6-7b, that’s a good thing isn’t it? Means price is reflected, no?
- I agree that there’s more hype than what it has to show for at this stage but hey, that’s what fuels the crypto market don’t you agree?
380 2018-05-28 22:53:00 There is not much to learn about 'patterns' in a world as new, volatile and emotional as crypto. The small pasts gives no usefull insights whatsoever. Also: the 'leaving room for...'-strategy is what annoys me most about all these guru's.
381 2018-05-28 22:52:58 This is actually viable!
382 2018-05-28 22:52:55 Who do you think will be the biggest profiteers in 2020/2021? A crypto which already has good network effects (e.g. ethereum) or a total new innovative application which will attract new investors/speculators?
383 2018-05-28 22:52:19 Nice reminder to those in crypto.   Just like in stocks...cash IS a position.

395 2018-05-28 22:50:21 the crypto economy barely exists though; there's negligible circular flow of income. That's the problem with crypto - a pile of cryptos is not capital, that you can grow; it's just a pile of a commodity, that you can only sell on.

398 2018-05-28 22:50:05 Tales of my crypto profits are greatly exaggerated! Haven’t even made 5 figures yet. But I saw a picture of myself from Thanksgiving 2013 and thought: what if?

Not gonna miss out next time!
399 2018-05-28 22:49:40 Sorry, you do realise 6800 is like $300 away and $11600 would confirm a bullish trend? This is probably the most bs idea I’ve seen yet

405 2018-05-28 22:48:11 Blockchain Company TraXion Builds Momentum Through ICO.
 #TraXion has a very important focus — to be a better bank in a blockchain-driven environment. The very talented and accomplished team is building a crypto-economy for the present and future.
406 2018-05-28 22:48:09 IF the price breaks below $6.500 level, we will be looking for lower lows. For now, we are still testing $7,000 range. But, BTC is looking very weak right now.

410 2018-05-28 22:48:00 And by extension why crypto is not yet investable by institutions IMO (though possible for speculation for some). Too much potential for crazy.

412 2018-05-28 22:47:41 I’m sitting here thinking...who da fark would sell at these prices. Then in the same thought I remember sitting here in March last year saying...”who da fark would buy at 1100. Imma wait till it’s back at 800.”

413 2018-05-28 22:47:23 I follow a lot of content and do not pay close attention to anyone in particular. The way crypto evolves worries me. More and more into a world of scamming and false hope for naieve  people. Not blaming you or anyone in particular.

422 2018-05-28 22:46:00 Two questions. Number one is how do these trolls get to use the same twitter screen name as the real person and number two is if they are here to devalue crypto then have they been planted by the established Financial traditional Titans aka the Warren Buffett types ?
423 2018-05-28 22:45:58 Topical quality setup  in the pasture of crypto highs teach. It is a greatest excuse to in-vest at an early bird juncture of expansion. To determine else, ensue the positive authors. #UHIVE

435 2018-05-28 22:44:36 Yes, it is. Tough to look at but that’s the reality of how we’re able to #tweet and do many many other things right now.
436 2018-05-28 22:44:28 No problem. Our goal is to educate and share what we're seeing as well. Better educated investors makes for a strong #crypto foundation and future.
437 2018-05-28 22:44:25 When I was serving in the Army weed was just too risky.

449 2018-05-28 22:43:38 Ok greg wtf is going in the crypto space. Getting slammed

452 2018-05-28 22:42:50 My point is more towars the emotional intelligence that is required to be a successful trader/investor
If you ger caught up by fear, its hard to stick to your own notes 
453 2018-05-28 22:42:43 LOL, I mentioned I might do one this afternoon in my morning crypto report.  Just something spur of the moment from requests from listeners and commentary last week
454 2018-05-28 22:42:37 Bounce
455 2018-05-28 22:42:34 I really don't understand this crypto market. Sold some alts during the green period.  Held fiat for days like these.  Then got tempted to swing trade by purchasing some coins and then the market dips further into the red, when i don't have any fiat on standby.  #HODL
456 2018-05-28 22:42:24 However, those who are looking for signs about which crypto might have a future may wish to take an extra long look at TRON (TRX).
457 2018-05-28 22:42:09 Lol thats why a month ago the majority of crypto twitter was bullish right?
458 2018-05-28 22:42:08 heartbreaking image
459 2018-05-28 22:41:36 Lol. Bro think about the big picture. Retail investors don't buy when the proper time to buy comes (the current bloodbath down to 3k), noobs are the ones who catch fomo and take our bags at 9k. Someone bought @ $10020 on Binance.

Are people still going to take the risk of investment? 
#Crypto #bitcoin
514 2018-05-28 22:34:32 Exactly, so given that in dot com alot of assets lost value rapidly, I feel similar fate awaits most crypto coins because most of the coins out there are useless. I think when it starts it can take only few months to "erase" 80% of projects. Question is when will it start?
515 2018-05-28 22:34:31 Crypto is Violent. Violent dumps are usually followed by Violent pumps.

536 2018-05-28 22:31:41 I guess all the crypto "analysts" that were posting charts and shilling coins weren't really "analysts" after all.

572 2018-05-28 22:27:10 Where we stutter on the price drop, as in its falling quick and at the time we had a temporary hold so I expected it to drop from there and land at 7094 before we see a short term trend flip. Which is happening now, lets watch to see if it holds also.

580 2018-05-28 22:25:54 Most consumers are just not aware of them and how to use them. Most reservations are completed though Holliday Inn Express or third party travel sites (Expedia). The way to accept payments in crypto is just not where it needs to be.
581 2018-05-28 22:25:51 If you're comparing "Dot com bubble stocks" to "accumulative crypto marketcap" they'll match up very similarly, they both are/were "emerging markets" so market cycles start fast and slow down as supply is distributed, BTC is in multi-year cycles now, but altcoins are much faster

583 2018-05-28 22:25:39 I received a similar inquiry from Gemini about a month ago.
584 2018-05-28 22:25:26 It’s not just the giveaways it’s the disjointing of discussions and ideas. And it also discredits the legitimacy of crypto’s security and overall strength. Also for the weaker among us scares some out of the space altogether.

635 2018-05-28 22:17:52 the "crypto experts" don't realize THEY are the market . The chart patterns &  reason why traditional TA works is a result of their own attitude and emotions .

691 2018-05-28 22:08:55 This project is a new era in the world of cryptocurrency really   interesting project this year, with a great concept and a cohesive team,   I believe that this project has a bright future @qurrex #qurrex #ICO #Crypto
692 2018-05-28 22:08:36 Not while BTC capacity is crippled. That is a game-changing event with effects already visible in BTC's crypto market share.

697 2018-05-28 22:06:17 @DaveKaval what would it take to implement some crypto currency at the stadium.  We are in the tech capital of the world.   I know some developers of some really efficient cryptos designed for energy efficiency and merchant use. Could this be discussed at office hours? #burstcoin
698 2018-05-28 22:05:49 All of Crypto was in a bull market during the time frame you referenced. Sure, ratios changed against BTC but overall sentiment was up. Overall sentiment is bearish now, why would any large cap crypto exuberantly push up when we might be headed to goblin town?
699 2018-05-28 22:05:33 I see I see. Yeah it really sucks. Almost every ICO and every exchange banned to Americans. We need some revised regulations, especially if crypto ever goes to the masses.

703 2018-05-28 22:04:58  thought the exact same thing and didn’t want to sound like a conspiracy theorist.

As crypto grows & spreads we could see more and more of these strategic coordinated attacks.

Enemies of crypto could use these tools for social engineering of the community & their perceptions

717 2018-05-28 22:02:47 I see your point but I feel the time frame can be shorter as for example dot com bubble lost 80% of value in very short time frame cca 8 years after it came into existance, since crypto "moves" faster I feel the time could be soon or do you think those two cannot be compared?

帰ったらまた元気なツイート楽しみにしています♪
719 2018-05-28 22:02:27 a simple reason crypto isn’t going up anymore could be that big hedge funds just stopped buying. no point in buying if the bull market is over. seems likely this is why prices will keep falling for awhile. June could be new lows, back to $3k btc.

722 2018-05-28 22:02:03 Totally agree with you when it comes to work/life integration. However, pensions can be used cleverly as tax structures (even for crypto). I don't know the specific US rules but UK pensions are exempt from income and capital gains taxes so a 5x gross is a 5x net. ;-)

727 2018-05-28 22:01:17 I think a very good case could be made that the bots/trolls that recently came to crypto Twitter are not designed to extract giveaway $$ but to weaken the crypto community. 

Think of people + their voice as transaction value, which has been dramatically lowered on this platform.

811 2018-05-28 21:43:44 I wouldn’t be surprised if he made the date in order to save face, but to the detriment of an actual peace agreement either.

815 2018-05-28 21:42:15 I'm a Crypto enthusiast... But I understand the future requires patience... It's like when your mom hated texting... now she's glued to the phone like you lol #XLE
816 2018-05-28 21:41:58 Lol, you're taking the "10 minutes" analogy quite literally I see. Not going to bother to respond to an argument that dumb. Trump doesn't do things by the book, and it wouldn't surprise me at all if he makes the summit happen despite not much time to plan it.
817 2018-05-28 21:41:50 Any thoughts on when the crypto market will turnaround? I’m hoping June is a great month #Cryptocurrencies #bitcoin #XRPTHESTANDARD #ripple #XLM
818 2018-05-28 21:41:31 At least they had 3 peaceful days not watching their wealth go down the toilet. I love your positive nature but if we don't bounce soon the chance of retail investors coming into this space within next 5yrs will be slim to none. The avg investor cannot handle these swings.

827 2018-05-28 21:39:19 For now, the market is a pump and dump scheme. If you invest huge amounts and have skills, you can earn a lot of money.
828 2018-05-28 21:39:08 @ercwl Eric Wall. More people should follow him. I used to hate him but now admire him for his brutal but honest alt-bashing backed by technical reasoning. He seems to see through the BS and hype.
He's like a crypto cop. In fact, he is.

832 2018-05-28 21:38:22 believe it or not crypto twitter probably isn't numero uno on the priority list.
833 2018-05-28 21:38:10 I don’t really pay attention to crypto. It is small ball market compared to tokenized securities.

844 2018-05-28 21:36:21 This is a pattern of activity that is extremely common in the media: twist a source's actual words into something slightly different to serve a narrative. It's become more obvious under this president because they're so blinded by their hatred for him that they're getting sloppy
845 2018-05-28 21:36:19 
846 2018-05-28 21:36:09 in that view 7k looks like a steady support; Im going starting pick up few more my favorite projects starting tonight; seems like we’ve been bouncing at the beginning of every month; top of that we have several mainNets launched in few days & coinbase under maintenance

849 2018-05-28 21:35:40 Idex being an exchange make money from exchanges of crypto but if people not buying and selling why would they keep it on if their not making money. The problem is people trying to sell before ico is over with that makes exchanges nervous
850 2018-05-28 21:35:12 Real campaign! I really like the line concept of their device inside! True professionals,friendly staff and most importantly the idea with a promising future!! Success to us all @ishookinc #ishook #token #crypto
851 2018-05-28 21:35:07 That´s how the rich and powerful stay rich and powerful. If 95% of people are not allowed to mess with their toys and enter their game, they don´t have to share anything, right?

853 2018-05-28 21:34:20 This is happening on both sides of the aisle. Some publications look for payment if you approach them for PR - especially the crypto news sites. Some mark as advertising, some not.

863 2018-05-28 21:33:13 As I said, the accurate summation of that quote would be "It's unlikely the summit will happen."  Why not report what the guy actually said and let others read in between the lines themselves? Why make up an analysis and then attribute it as an actual quote?
864 2018-05-28 21:33:12 Project looks promising. We hope for the success of the team and the community supporting this project, and we hope that it will last a long time. Good luck to the project @KoronaCoin #KoronaCoin #Token #Crypto

869 2018-05-28 21:32:48 I think it's about time that crypto currency investors start demanding that the exchanges that are allowing massive dumping of BTC need to stop this shit immediately. We all know it's the goddamn banking cartel and their hirelings that are responsible..
870 2018-05-28 21:32:42 Market fundamentals like supply and demand even apply to crypto? And here I thought we had moved post-everything.

918 2018-05-28 21:22:01 I agree on the high costs.. you can always try too find the gems but then you should buy MN on multiple projects cause chances are that some will never make it on an exchange. So for a beginner in crypto these are hard things too begin with

929 2018-05-28 21:20:43 The flaw in Bitcoin incentive structure/game theory is that it assumes a long only market. Where leverage/derivatives enable large short positions the economics of a "51 per cent. attack" (actually lower percentage) change. This is a key vulnerability  not yet priced.

972 2018-05-28 21:14:11 Small thought: I believe in the crypto sphere because it's a global market that never sleeps, it's speed of movement is around 6x that of regular markets. Same movements compressed into 1/6th the time = faster lessons.
973 2018-05-28 21:13:53 It's meaningful as a reserve currency and interbank settlement layer. Retail payments and global, individual inclusion require something new.
974 2018-05-28 21:13:32 Pretty ironic that you guys are talking about reading comprehension when you clearly misinterpreted what the official was saying. More accurate summation would be "It's unlikely," as the language the aid used was careful not to use the word impossible or any synonyms of it.
975 2018-05-28 21:13:22 Konsep di balik ICO adalah memanfaatkan teknologi blockchain sebagai database aman satu atap untuk persiapan dan pelaksanaan transaksi internasional di antara bisnis dan klien.

987 2018-05-28 21:11:24 Most people in the last year come into crypto for the money, don't forget it took almost 10 years for the original players to "get rich", be patient and keep honing your skills

990 2018-05-28 21:10:42 Crypto time.

Imo you want some $BTC and $ETH. You also want some mid cap/promising projects like $ZRX. Good to find a small cap or 2, for big risk/reward ratio. 

Keep some money liquid in order to capitalize on a time like now

Research your projects, make $$, good luck!

1093 2018-05-28 20:55:57 It is great that Uphold has added fiat/xrp, but keep 2 things in mind: 1) Upholds international reach currently and 2) the entire crypto market's current slump.  Rome wasn't built in a day.  Keep the faith and keep hodling!
1094 2018-05-28 20:55:36 To be totally clear, I’m not talking about backwards compatibility in general but rather the absolute mathematical necessity to hard fork to larger block sizes for any Bitcoin branch to scale.  Without that Bitcoin is not meaningful.

1096 2018-05-28 20:54:51 Франция выпустила свою криптовалюту под названием Macroncoin (MCRN). Поспешите и купите MCRN за копейки, эксперты оценили эту валюту и считают что уже к Маю этого года цена взорвется (x100)!

1098 2018-05-28 20:54:23 I respect your work. I wouldn’t pay them much attention to people who don’t have a clue. Plus crypto is full of newbies, hypnotized by swindlers, thinking of quick riches. Usually they are the dumb one who distribute their wealth to more seasoned folks.

1154 2018-05-28 20:44:58 It will depend of the amount of X crypto that you have available in order to double spend during that 1hr period.

1166 2018-05-28 20:43:00 The physical impossibility to get everyone to unanimously agree on something and then all be paying attention at the same time to upgrade their software creates two chains. It's not a refusal to upgrade. It's the majority who have better things to do. Backwards compitability wins

1168 2018-05-28 20:42:51 Pick your crypto of choice: “free” except you need to own unstable tokens & take on high volatility risk & includes pay off to early adopters at inflated prices. Stable tokens from a separately owned Corp/network that charges a tiny fee, but eliminates volatility & pay-off-tax.

1173 2018-05-28 20:41:31 When the BTC rally starts it will look like a great idea  - but you might have to wait 2 months
1174 2018-05-28 20:41:15 We already have two chains.  BCH is following the only mathematically sound option for wide-scale adoption and BTC has handcuffed itself to a broken 1st tier.  I invite you to do the math on total transactions possible even at 8MB; it won’t cover the basic needs of LN.

1191 2018-05-28 20:38:26 Ok so if the chairman of the SEC tweeted something about crypto regulation incoming and that affected your coins price then it’s not decentralized?

1221 2018-05-28 20:34:05 I'm sorry, but 'bank-grade crypto' is too long. Please choose a shorter phrase that doesn't include symbols or spaces.
1222 2018-05-28 20:33:54 True, but the profits from April are slowly being reduced to nothing... Maybe wrong strategy to #hodl ?

1229 2018-05-28 20:32:44 Great, so the merchant saves a few bucks on each transaction but potentially loses hundreds when the price of the crypto currency dips.

1239 2018-05-28 20:30:40 The combination of token ownership & “network ownership” is the original sin of unstable crypto. Creates Ponzi scheme where new users must pay inflated prices to old. Sacrifices long-term usability as the Ponzi premium creates increased volatility risks that overshadow usability.

1244 2018-05-28 20:30:00 That’s a noble response, and you’re one of the few people I’d buy that from. If you sat most crypto investors down and said “look, you’ll likely lose much of your money, or even all of it, but you may eventually have a much better financial system”, I think most would exit.

1282 2018-05-28 20:22:51 The unstable crypto concept has failed as a payment system. Combining use function with ownership function is counterproductive. Doesn’t exist anywhere else.

1295 2018-05-28 20:21:08 Bitcoin is the fiat gateway/faucet that regulates the size of the crypto economy. As more crypto tokens are created, with additional operating overhead, the greater the fiat selling pressure applied to Bitcoin to maintain these costs. Market dynamics have become far more complex.

1308 2018-05-28 20:18:10 Critics point to the obvious and well-known risks of crypto but gloss over the multitude of unknown / ignored risks of our existing financial infrastructure. Things like market manipulation have always existed, we can just see it more clearly in crypto.

1331 2018-05-28 20:15:34 I don't think many Bitcoin maximalists would argue that 4MB or 8MB is unsafe. What's undesirable is creating two currencies, and the dynamics of getting everyone to upgrade at the same time. It just won't happen. Backwards compatability always wins.

1376 2018-05-28 20:08:57 What if, what if, what if. Its all speculative at this point. Set it and forget it. Come back in 12 to 18 months. All this daily TA doesnt work. Its a myth thinking folks can apply traditional securities or FX TA to crypto.

Where should the new money now come from, if most of the new investors are locked out?

Urban dictionary has it

should be a few days, actually today, but probably really a long time, maybe never.

1466 2018-05-28 19:55:57 it is what's going on he just worded it wrong, you had commented on an influencer in crypto twitter who had the free ETH scam happen to them right before you got locked out 100% guarantee.

1473 2018-05-28 19:55:07 How odd, in that pool they specifically said tokens from presale will be unlocked after ico. Anyway even if bonus is locked (there is no proof it is), but even if, presale will dump all their tokens cuz anyway they will get 50% back later
1474 2018-05-28 19:55:06 Please back your claims with some more decisive evidence. I've made contact with numerous sources and the team who have all confirmed at least a 3 month lock up. All this FUD is unnecessary

1488 2018-05-28 19:52:22 How important is OTC trade these days? Is there a reliable source or way to gauge OTC volume trends over the last months? Sounds to me, it's knowledge only available to insiders, but important info nonetheless

1490 2018-05-28 19:52:17 @jaltucher I stopped listening to your podcast when you were pitching the crypto currency angle. It was way outside of what I was used to from you. Having taken a break, I’m back on board with the podcast as your way of questioning is second to none, and once again, genuine.

1493 2018-05-28 19:51:56 mi el diablo blanco, me habla un poco espanol jajajaja
1494 2018-05-28 19:51:56 I don't know about that, the contributions I am aware of are all locked 3 - 6 months (depending on the size of the contribution)
1495 2018-05-28 19:51:50 It's fascinating to me how all the progressive financial experts who pushed radically innovative tools like CDOs and derivatives are suddenly finding themselves looking at #crypto and #bitcoin very conservatively.

1497 2018-05-28 19:51:40 Will you go out with me? ;)
1498 2018-05-28 19:51:38 Hard to say...I personally think that the 'sell the news' phase for OPC has already taken place earlier this month and a huge spike due to the coin burn is unlikely given the current market situation. Therefore I swapped >66% of OPC, but kept some to HODL (no financial advise :-)
1499 2018-05-28 19:51:24 
1500 2018-05-28 19:51:18 Sorry but that will never happen
1501 2018-05-28 19:51:16 Haha that’s pretty much it
1502 2018-05-28 19:51:11 51%攻撃で多額の資金を不正に得るには相当量の換金が出来る必要が有る。つまり、狙われるのは、取引所になるんでしょ？

取引所は送金はXRPしか受け付け無ければ、解決じゃん！

あー基軸通貨来ちゃうなー
1503 2018-05-28 19:51:02 Good shout, everything from their registration to the voting process was a complete joke and completely unfair when $PAC tried. Many better options out there for $PCN!
1504 2018-05-28 19:50:51 Yes, but it is in the form of crypto, I can just swap it back for full value at any time, right?
1505 2018-05-28 19:50:32 Fiyat hiç 820 yi görmemiş o yüzden satış gerçekleşmemiş.Örneğin 821 ken birisi 819 a satmış ve sonra aşağı yönlü hareket devam etmiş olabilir.Stop ve limit arası skalayı genişletirsen satışta problem olmaz.

1509 2018-05-28 19:50:07 Note that I am not an expert on large-scale electrical supply so maybe the comparison is flawed (crypto generation in the Czech Republic would increase its overall consumption, after all) but it's abundantly clear that there's a big problem with the digital monopoly money

1604 2018-05-28 19:37:01 /1 Folks new to Crypto: Take it from folks who have weathered multiple bear markets with 70% retracements. It WILL recover. There WILL be another long term bull run, crypto is NOT going to zero. When in a bull market, play to win. When in a bear market, you play to not lose.

1621 2018-05-28 19:33:53 They are solving a non-problem. Fiat, credit cards and the like work extremely well. Anonymity on line is the only thing crypto can offer, and for non-criminal transactions, anonymity is a bug not a feature.

1627 2018-05-28 19:32:14 With increased regulation... which is coming, we will likely see a decline in volatility and manipulation. And the crypto trading community will look much different than it does today.

1646 2018-05-28 19:28:42 Ultimately nobody knows. What I do feel confident about is that real code is being written and real problems being worked on. That is how I have always measured $crypto and it still is. The price follows that in due time. Patience is key - it's also hard.

1683 2018-05-28 19:22:33 Yeah. There's also the Tucker Carlson method where he doesn't outright call it white nationalism but he fearmongerers about whites being "demographically displaced" by non-white immigration. Black Pigeon Speaks does this a lot. He's a crypto white nationalist.

1691 2018-05-28 19:21:31 I've assumed that individual operators will start covertly removing some checks. For instance, you can churn through blocks quicker if you disable some crypto ops. You'd still get double-spend checks, etc., but ...
1692 2018-05-28 19:21:30 Diversification and individuality in BTC-dependency has made crypto trading weak and boring for me.

1773 2018-05-28 19:07:33 I don't think your WiFi *credentials* would be on the ECC508 to begin with. Your crypto keys would, but they never leave the device (authentication happens on-device). Secure storage of WiFi credentials is a very different problem - crypto keys are much more dangerous if leaked.

1790 2018-05-28 19:04:05 I think most people that are involved with cryptocurrency don't like the current set up of the world we're in. That's why we've moved in to the crypto world! It's a way for us to escape the system. She has a point lol

1797 2018-05-28 19:02:43 Crypto’s are linked to BTC on Exchanges not the dollar or whatever. If BTC goes down almost all crypto’s go down. You still get the same amount of btc for your tron. Just less dollar
1798 2018-05-28 19:02:37 Respect that as well 
1799 2018-05-28 19:02:33 dont be jealous Peter, you will catch up soon. By now, you should have learned that Crypto doesn't follow the probablity of successful TA as it is manipulated. Also, difficult to argue with to wealth creation of many of these Geniuses. How long did it take you to afford a lambo?

1806 2018-05-28 19:01:46 So imagine trying to explain to them this new digital system and trying to bridge the learning gap of crypto currency.

This is why such complex systems like those which incorporate advanced Proof of stake, Atomic swaps etc. (which most of you reading this probably understand)
1807 2018-05-28 19:01:39 It's because our brains see the files like any other files on our computers. When we see changes in the application our minds apply old logic to it. Would be cool if I could restore balances after I sold them :)

2002 2018-05-28 18:37:14 Apparently a lot of people didn't follow the sage advice to never invest money you can't afford to lose, because a lot of people still selling their $crypto and I'm sure some of them need money for essentials. That's one of the downsides of attracting a lot of newbs.

2027 2018-05-28 18:33:42 I'm honored and understand the impulse. If I had all my notifications on all day I would get no damn peace. We now have filters of filters of filters.
2028 2018-05-28 18:33:39 I agree, however $Xhv and the BitcoinAir token forking from it will change this in dramatic fashion.  You should join the BitcoinAir core Dev team man, come check it out.
2029 2018-05-28 18:33:03 you can money in crypto if you learn to manage your losses and take small gains. shooting for the moon is how you get $rekt.
2030 2018-05-28 18:32:59 how to get this sheet ?
2031 2018-05-28 18:32:51 wow
2032 2018-05-28 18:32:46 To be fair, if you wanted to anonymize a transaction, or a portion of your assets, you could simply buy on exchange, and transfer to outside wallet. No saying if that is a wallet you own. You could have used that crypto to pay for services, for which there is no tax.

2056 2018-05-28 18:29:24 That’s a negative, my friend. Bitcoin has bigger issues, like who’s looking to dismantle the King  of crypto.
2057 2018-05-28 18:29:23 Do you plan hodling long term? I do see potential for big gains but long term. I’ve not been in crypto very long #cryptovirgin

2060 2018-05-28 18:29:10 Korona Coin is an interesting and promising project, the essence of which is to create an ecosystem that would allow the implementation of the crypto currency in the real economy and create favorable conditions for the business.
2061 2018-05-28 18:28:44 Could cryptocurrencies be a crazy business idea to help the communities you advocate for? Market it as Financial Activism (cryptos) meets Social Activism.  Doctoral Thesis? Many crypto developers are serious advocates for equality so your values align.

2067 2018-05-28 18:27:06 Monero is still the best bitcoin mixer
2068 2018-05-28 18:26:58 It’s certainly off putting to see the lack of professionalism in the crypto community. I’d say that it’s lost investments because of it.
2069 2018-05-28 18:26:55 Very funny 
2070 2018-05-28 18:26:51 Prediction :- Institutional Investors Are Coming to Crypto. Expect a never seen before rally in November/December.

2072 2018-05-28 18:26:45 It's certainly interesting to think about a transition to a new type of mining, but I remain bearish on bitcoin. Crypto mining doesn't seem like a viable business.

2076 2018-05-28 18:26:11 What if people were as passionate about the companies in their share portfolio as their crypto? Only thing remotely close might be $APPLE 'fans', though many of them hold zero shares I assume. Imagine $KO or $GM shareholders behaving like $XVG or $TRX bag holders...
2077 2018-05-28 18:26:11 $get.v all shareholders should have thier proxy vote by now . I sure hope penny stays and gets rid if all board members and replace them with big crypto guys.  Imho it's our shot to get back to multiple dollars
2078 2018-05-28 18:26:10 Apart from trading crypto, I enjoy investing in them. Some use cases of crypto make for an exciting future scenario where blockchain technology will be used by many unaware in everyday living.

2087 2018-05-28 18:24:42 When $BTC dips below $7k, I'm jumping on board. Might dip to $6.8, but at that stage, according to charts, there should be a bounce.

2089 2018-05-28 18:24:19 as more and more governments try to control crypto, more and more coins/traders/liquidity will leave the centralized chokepoints
2090 2018-05-28 18:23:29 Yet. Once the fabeled mass delistings begin theres nowhere else to go but dex's, which is where the liquidity will go. You can't honestly expect people to leave what is easy and already setup, you need a catalyst for them to leave centralized exchanges
2091 2018-05-28 18:23:26 If there's one thing we've learned in this space, is that change is rapid. Don't mage the mistake if thinking things will remain the same.

TODAY there is a lack of liquidity... Tomorrow, everything will be different.
2092 2018-05-28 18:23:24 So you are bearish on Haven and BitcoinAir?  I think you should do a deep dive into those two Messi, I think you might make an exception.  They are just getting off the ground, and together will really change the game IMO.

2109 2018-05-28 18:20:36 there was no crypto bounce in April if you remember correctly. there was a huge pump. and it only came after prices had been going sideways for weeks. we are far from that scenario. we are still going down.

2157 2018-05-28 18:13:51 The best marketing for $nano will be ,if they next $crypto bull market will occur before 50%+ $btc #LightningNetwork adoption. Another scaling debate would of course benefit Nano. Although I think it’s strong enough to stand on its own.

2175 2018-05-28 18:10:56 Marketing tends to work great for some $crypto projects, you’re right. The only two events I can think of are Ledger support and Coinbase listing- both are under central authority. Can’t promise such moves.
2176 2018-05-28 18:10:53 You can add Tone to the list of "Elitists" that refer to DigiByte as a shitcoin. They are bitter towards Jared for the simple fact that he refuses to kiss their a$$e$ and subsequently try to stifle his success. When the crypto dust settles, we'll see who's left standing.

2191 2018-05-28 18:08:32 @DeltaApp  - do you think it'd be possible to create a function in your app to view your portfolio as a pie chart? Get an idea of what percent of each coin represents your holdings? Optional to select % based on FIAT value or BTC Value.

Just an idea for the next update.

Thanks!

 I think there are many nerds like him out there and this is the worst time to invest in crypto.  

Let them cash out.

2204 2018-05-28 18:05:32 Yes. It boggles my mind when people tell me Crypto is virtual and not real. If your life savings are in a bank, and anything over 100k. Try walking in and withdrawing it for cash. Explain to me why your "real" money won't be given to you.

2429 2018-05-28 17:36:09 I think people have an unique opportunity with crypto to learn Trading & Investing much faster. Crypto markets are much faster than traditional markets, we are sprinting through market cycles and the competition isn’t really there yet.

2440 2018-05-28 17:34:07 it took me a while to get comfortable with crypto just bc it's not like trading the stock market at all - what's your trading experience
2441 2018-05-28 17:33:37 Can we all get jobs on wall street as crypto traders?
2442 2018-05-28 17:33:32 I also really like the way they chopped that last note after a single beat. Wasn't expecting it, but it's very nice.
2443 2018-05-28 17:33:25 Im only 5months into crypto and not yet been in profit since then. I buy whenever it's low and i have free funds, i expected a dip when BTC was at 9k and i mistraded badly. That was an opportunity to make some gains but FOMO'D back at 9.8k and holding the way down... #FML

2454 2018-05-28 17:32:13 You can’t tell the crypto twitteratti how to trade. There isn’t only one trade they want and that’s long to the hilt. Tell them it’s not going to the moon and they don’t want to know you.

2457 2018-05-28 17:31:30 Crypto moves faster, so everyone becomes experts faster.

Think of everything you have learned since being @VitalikButerin ‘s age.

2533 2018-05-28 17:19:00 Sad but nice rip
2534 2018-05-28 17:18:58 the great thing about crypto is that it can go so much lower than you imagine. well, great if you’re shorting. there may never be a better time to short. easy money.

2573 2018-05-28 17:13:11 Sorry Peter but you are playing with words. I Think you perfectly understood what I mean. You speak for a while about a possible $LTC rally and today you continue on this way. In the other hand, you blame all the Crypto Market. No sens. Anyway Crypto market is not Stock market.

2584 2018-05-28 17:10:55 It clicked. I was in search of another way to make money other than selling my time in a job. Was dabbling in digital marketing when I stumbled upon crypto and well, the rest is history. Started in November, fell prey to bitconnect, so still down 50% on initial investment.

2587 2018-05-28 17:10:32 And remember that the key benefit of Bitcoin is NOT crypto and/or blockchain.

Rather, the real benefits are...

- Independent
- Transnational

And this resistant to meddling by central banks.

Which is why they will be legislated against.

2594 2018-05-28 17:09:06 who cares about Zimbabwe? Cryptoids always seek confirmation bias looking for any shred of positive news to divert their attention from the possible multi-year bear market and wipe out of 99% of #Crypto mkt.   Post about 50-80% drawdowns, not about Zimbabwe

2605 2018-05-28 17:08:03 Every crypto market depends on BTC. My thoughts about NXT without clear signals from BTC mean nothing. And for BTC we have to wait breakouts or reversals.
2606 2018-05-28 17:07:58 Guys there are so many online alternatives out there I stopped listening to LBC and BBC globalist lefty clowns ages ago. Simple searches will surprise you, and get out of the establishment monetary enslavement system and get some crypto.

2613 2018-05-28 17:06:27 :3: A better alternative to crypto-scammers would be to write a program looking for replies to a user with a 80% fuzzy match on the name + key words / phrases within the reply and/or a link with a redirect.

2692 2018-05-28 16:52:29 It really is the wild wild west out here. 
It’s a crying shame folks get info from these places after having done a bit of digging only to find these Crypto-Rags, taking these stories as if coming from responsible, VERIFIED journalists or from bonafide publications.
2693 2018-05-28 16:51:58 One question, How much of south India is crypto ?
2694 2018-05-28 16:51:51 True
2695 2018-05-28 16:51:34 Although this isn't financial advice:

I highly recommend picking up $PCN before they get listed on @Cryptopia_NZ

The swap is coming to $DAPS... the privacy features are incredible. They are a sleeping giant at 9sats.. and 100% staking until the swap.

Don't miss out! $DYOR
2696 2018-05-28 16:51:29 imo you're making the same mistake that I made when I first started looking at crypto: particularly in other countries, the enhanced security and anonymity of cryptocurrency is well worth *many times* the actual transaction cost. Don't compare only to US banking/currency systems.
2697 2018-05-28 16:50:58 I would say there might be a large pump soon but then this same shit for another week or so. #crypto #ltc
2698 2018-05-28 16:50:43 I think you’re making some assumptions if you think they’re competing with PayPal.  PayPal’s stock is fine despite the explosion of crypto currencies.  As a cyber security person, I’ve seen a major shift by criminals to crypto currency.  Were there shifts in other sectors?
2699 2018-05-28 16:50:38 This crypto cycle is not playing ball this year.  Things have changed compared to previous years.  Traders will scalp make some and lose some during this period.  Ultimately hodling will pay off big time, when that epic run actually begins.

2703 2018-05-28 16:49:46 There are a lot of #crypto peeps who are waiting for a repeat #bullrun in nov/dec - I think that's a mistake. The bull run will come sooner than that - there are some surprises coming very soon.

2713 2018-05-28 16:48:44 What if crypto is all just a shakeout for a $USD pump?
2714 2018-05-28 16:48:34 I predict that in near future each government will try to launch its own scam crypto that it can infate, but fortunately real Bitcoin or a freedom bearing fork of it (BCH) will be available allowing people to opt out of the scam and into global voluntaryism.  Exciting times.

2726 2018-05-28 16:47:01 The number of bitcoins is capped, but the number of crypto currencies is not. Which means, in the long run, a crypto should never be worth more than the cost to produce.

2761 2018-05-28 16:42:18 Correction: You are dumb. Verge also copied algorithms from bitcoin, and others - which is the whole point of "open source" software - to share code in the public domain. Please educate yourself about crypto basics before pretending to understand. Start by reading the black paper
2762 2018-05-28 16:42:11 if your paid group leader is telling you polo is dead and buried, you might want to enroll them in remedial crypto classes because most of us learned not to bet against bitmain roughly 800 years ago

2767 2018-05-28 16:41:18 Is that because the underlying value remains the same, so each outstanding coin is now worth more? Makes sense.

I still wonder if the psychological effect of seeing your balance change is worth the hassle of the extra transactions.

2832 2018-05-28 16:32:58 5. Dear HODL’ers, please protect yourself by investing only in the best developers who are capable of protecting your assets. Probably the only long-term incontestable thesis in the entire crypto space is this: invest in gold developer communities.

3012 2018-05-28 16:05:30 the king is dead, long live the king

I dont see it as a healthy disruption if you look at the top crypto wallets and see that most of these are belonging to exchanges - not as a combined user amount, but actual revenues they made in crypto. Too much power imo

3029 2018-05-28 16:02:30 Very possibly. Most ICOs are not professionally run. Managers lack finance experience. Thus there's been little hedging of crypto exposure afaik. Not a problem for as long as prices not going down. Yet if prices drop low enough ....

3107 2018-05-28 15:55:51 A bank is nothing more then a symbol of power.

The name might change but its form remains. I trust governments and banks over a random anonymous entity who holds a lot of crypto.

Change should come from within, not by replacing the whole at once hoping history doesnt repeat

3109 2018-05-28 15:55:30 The rainbow chart, very undervalued in my opinion.
3110 2018-05-28 15:55:24 Accepting crypto payments does not suffice. Need to change the liabilities side from USD (or whatever fiat) to crypto. That means signing contracts nominated in crypto.

3115 2018-05-28 15:54:24 Another stupid PR stunt for a $crypto event. Shows that we’re still in a very immature market space. That’s not how you lure in institutional investors - although looking at the price maybe it is.

I have never wiped an OS before... but since you have an almost identical build as mine (same cards/motherboard/CPU/SSD) I think this is the most likely culprit ...and sounds like yet another reason to move over to Linux soon

3130 2018-05-28 15:51:45 This is great work! Security is one of the most important aspect of crypto that should be considered.
3131 2018-05-28 15:51:36 Annoying. But I guess that was bound to happen
3132 2018-05-28 15:51:32 Crypto has some pretty basic rules.
Don’t put in money you can’t afford to lose.
Don’t keep coins on exchanges.
Buy the dip. 
The best thing to do is simply to hodl. 
3133 2018-05-28 15:51:31 This crypto bear market is providing the right incentives for people to start working on valuation models for this asset class. With more development in valuation models, better coins/tokens will be launched instead of the ambition porn pump and dump tokens.
3134 2018-05-28 15:51:31 Solution: pay rent in crypto & go to groceries/restaurants accepting crypto ;)

3142 2018-05-28 15:50:10 The fact that Bitcoin has proven to stand up as a real currency, means that all crypto-currencies can also stand up as a real currencies too.  Bitcoin, the first crypto-currency, has pioneered the path for all crypto-currencies.

3151 2018-05-28 15:48:38 I've seen 3 or 4 companies doing crypto-collateralized loans in the last month; analogous to putting up your AAPL shares with someone and getting lent 80% of the value in USD. This will serve an important function not just for short-selling or defragmenting the money market, but

3159 2018-05-28 15:47:28 ICOs cashing out of their BTC and ETH, selling for USD, is possibly the largest risk crypto prices face in 2018. Dropping prices could trigger a rat race to the bottom, as developers need to eat and rental has to be paid. Operating costs are in USD.

3169 2018-05-28 15:46:28 I'm just amazed at the buzzword jargon in the crypto world. They even apply it to money and dollars. They can't help it - they have to call it fiat or some other jargon. 

Has anyone created buzzword bingo for crypto? I'd like to print some for all @ImpressionVC so we can play!

3181 2018-05-28 15:45:17 Most ICOs are in the business of developing a product, rather than speculating with their ICO funds. Hence ICOs should all hire a Treasurer or Asset Manager to hedge their crypto exposure and maintain the USD value of their assets. Selling all crypto is the simpler way.

3186 2018-05-28 15:45:00 The result is a distributed system with no single point of failure. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with each other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.

3191 2018-05-28 15:44:37 Achieving the fall of government at the expense of civilization is not a good trade. Small, progressive steps towards liberty, localized decentralization is best. Whichever crypto does that best should be promoted.
3192 2018-05-28 15:44:35 Hopefully they fail I hate the idea of a bank making it big with crypto . Crypto is the one thing they can't govern and control at the moment . This is one of many steps to giving power back to the men and women sitting in boardrooms making decisions for us
3193 2018-05-28 15:44:23 Oh nice! I‘ll take another look at it and then decide. Almost wondering if this all is true, why this isn’t hyped more. So are so many rubbish ICOs around with a shit ton of hype and then there is this compliant ICO and no hype at all.

3204 2018-05-28 15:43:07 You implemented an asic resistant algorithm into a bitcoin fork creating a inherently insecure version of bitcoin called BTG. You ignored multiple warnings about doing this and shilled on the basis of decentralisation. How is this level of ignorance helping advance crypto?

3223 2018-05-28 15:40:20 Everyone that owns #crypto has been told over and over again not to leave coins on exchanges.  They were even told that Poloniex would require verification.  Cry babies gonna cry.
3224 2018-05-28 15:39:57 $BTC is dead. 
It was nothing more than hype. 
We are going to $3k by July. 
Crypto currency has nothing to do with Blockchain technology. Banks will be using Blockchain with fiat and not coins. 

WAKE UP PEOPLE.
3225 2018-05-28 15:39:37 @RealistNews I see you retweeting, but no YouTube posting. Are you ok. BTW this NOT the bad CryptoGranny !

3227 2018-05-28 15:39:21 I would liked your bitcoin feature prediction ..Really amazing bull planned to come crypto Ath
3228 2018-05-28 15:39:19 Lol nah. That’s like the oldest trick in the book for crypto scamming. @hitbtc please look into it.
3229 2018-05-28 15:39:12 We keep buying crypto with the hope we can get back to Useless, failing , devalued fiat currency. Imagine a world where we say fuck fiat !!! Buy  trade & exchange value thru tokens in a parallel decentralized financial system  .
3230 2018-05-28 15:39:08 More Lessons Learnt in Crypto in this Long Ass Bear Season....

-Never get emotional with projects/coins, however good a project is, it will have to bow down to the rules of the market.
3231 2018-05-28 15:39:02 I’m a huge TenX bull.
3232 2018-05-28 15:38:57 I personally think it's actually kinda funny to see big corporations & businesses of all sorts that used to bash crypto and even threaten the job security of their employees are now running a legal race to open trade/investment for cyrptos asap *cough* @jpmorgan
3233 2018-05-28 15:38:55 Wow, this sounds like it could be it ... After installing Windows 10 Pro I did a wide range of updates then I did disable auto updates but not because I thought it would mess up my hashing rate, I didnt want it updating without my permission ... what version/build should I be on?

3241 2018-05-28 15:37:29 @AmeerRosic dropping truthbombs on the marketing panel at #BlockShowEurope right now. If your ico needs marketing, you already lost. The team is where it's at. Also another endorsement of #daicos, let's make that happen pls
3242 2018-05-28 15:37:18 3/ On the other hand if the token will be a security and will only be traded on their exchange and security complaint exchanges, this dump might not happen. Anyway thanks for bringing up this project! If i consider investing, i‘ll use your ref link

3252 2018-05-28 15:35:43 $BTC: If you're not buying back $BTC right now, you might think about doing so. #oversold and dangerously close to long time #support
3253 2018-05-28 15:35:42 2/ The only issue in my view is that i missed the PreICO and they had a 25% bonus. With their platform coming up Q3 and profit sharing not earlier than Q4, preICO and privat investors might dump on ICO investors and buy back later...

3377 2018-05-28 15:19:51 Marshall Islands replaces the US dollar with crypto

The Marshall Islands is a sovereign territory in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and has used the US dollar as its only currency since gaining independence in 1979.

Late last week, the country's government made the decision.
3378 2018-05-28 15:19:50 This is a daily struggle for every crypto community. They also still aren't accepting any new verified accounts, which compounds the problem and makes scams like this more effective.

3506 2018-05-28 15:06:40 Yes, kudos to anyone rising above the grime of poverty. Yet I hope those "1%" are charitable enough to help their neighbors also rise above, since very few can afford to mine or invest in crypto there.

3583 2018-05-28 14:59:06 The emphasis is on McCabe’s comments, that the agents who interviewed Flynn, did not suspect him of lying. Comey’s own testimony in front of the committee also supports this conclusion.

3778 2018-05-28 14:30:49 Sadly there are still too many folks out there that for whatever reason cannot accept that #Bitcoin is what moves this market. Until as a community we all show some level of support to the front line, we will never see the market success we all once enjoyed.

3779 2018-05-28 14:30:45 Yep! Got them parked and earning staking/MN rewards to increase my bag. You may ot may not be aware that the crypto market has generally followed BTC down. No guaranteed winners, but didn't get $IC as a quick trade play.

3786 2018-05-28 14:30:08 I agree man. It’s seems like people forget that in order to bring crypto to light and to make this a truly revolutionary movement that it’ll be a huge team effort. Share projects you like. Follow people that have similar judgment. Take the good advice and leave the bad alone

For one - if people want crypto regardless of where they live they can, and will find a way to get it

Also if they have to jump through more hoops to attain it, that would only increase price due to middle men.

3828 2018-05-28 14:23:29 Is there evidence that Donald Trump has laundered money? And remember, the whole point of the special counsel was to investigate allegations made by Democrats that Trump conspired with the Russian government to win the election. We are a far cry from that issue now.

3902 2018-05-28 14:13:01 What you need to understand is most of these people tweeting that they are making tons of money are full of shit. This is crypto twitter. Don’t get caught up in this. Do not follow anyone’s trades. Dyor and the money will come.

3904 2018-05-28 14:12:23 1) "Change" in crypto markets is like "dog years" compared to Wall Street, where 1 year in crypto = 7 years on Wall Street. If Wall Street eventually goes the route of crypto, to decentralized trading platforms, then certainly decentralized securities tokens make sense.
3905 2018-05-28 14:12:14 The amount of scams and fraudulent individuals in crypto still remains one of the biggest hindering factor in Bitcoin and other crypto currency adoption.
3906 2018-05-28 14:12:12 A 10 B market cap? Above #Litecoin, #Cardano, #Stellar, etc.? No way! hahaha. 0.015 $ as much in a fully #bullmarket.

4035 2018-05-28 13:57:07 The worst part of a bear market like this (aside from portfolios bleeding out) is alot of the noobs I’ve explained crypto too, who had very little interest before, now seem really adamant about informing me of how low the price of everything is going. My response to them is BTFD!
4036 2018-05-28 13:57:01 Well, it can be an addiction like gambling. When you win, it's euphoric, but when you lose it's so devastating you don't feel like you should stop.

4166 2018-05-28 13:42:43 Good for you, it's not easy by any means.
4167 2018-05-28 13:42:40 @VitalikButerin should we expect Ethereum to adopt zero knowledge proofs or some other mechanism to ensure total privacy in the longer term? Or will the promise of limitless anonymity scare regulators and ultimately damage the regulatory environ. for crypto?

4203 2018-05-28 13:37:28 I've noticed that any significant buy that I make is immediately followed by a sharp drop in price. Market Makers use this tactic to scare a buyer into feeling they've made a bad buy and often times leads them to sell right back to the maker at a cheaper price.

4254 2018-05-28 13:31:39 I mean: what makes #BCN a good investment? What does it do that so it can go up in price?

So far, nothing outstanding about their tech (not to mention what happened with Binance). And also it is not undervalued (1 BILLION market cap, rank 21).

4286 2018-05-28 13:28:05 BTW, it’s not the same problem as with crypto exchanges. When a Bitcoin exchange loses bitcoins to theft, it’s tough luck. Nothing to do (except for catching the thieves)

But when an exchange loses $AAPL tokens, the government is bound to intervene and require reissuance
4287 2018-05-28 13:28:05 Fuck sakes bro! You used to be about da hoes and beats… all this crypto $$$ 
4288 2018-05-28 13:28:03 Patience is the true virtue, even in crypto. Things will progress, even if slowly, and merits of good projects will be reflected in prices. It's just a matter of time and global circumstances. Some days are just bad for entire crypto space overall.

4291 2018-05-28 13:27:49 I work there so I thought I'd lookup the policy. Apparently they consider it to be too volatile and more importantly it's unregulated. I bet once it's regulated and once a standard crypto emerges you'll probably see a policy change.

4311 2018-05-28 13:24:36 If we hodl this long why give up now. Patience. I never had patience. Crypto has taught me that.
4312 2018-05-28 13:24:36 Makes no sense. 0.4eth guaranteed for first 2 hours. Many contributions under the 0.4eth, and we made the 5000 eth cap exactly. 100% people contributed 100% allowance. Eh yuh right
4313 2018-05-28 13:24:22 The main question right now: If you're not invested in $PCN yet, why not?!
4314 2018-05-28 13:24:18 Still don't understand your analyze. If $LTC starts a huge rally, It is conditionned by a rally of $BTC and almost the whole #crypto Market. It is a non sense to say in all your lasts tweet that #BTC #ETH and Cie will drop a lot again but LTC will go up and the global going down

4330 2018-05-28 13:22:08 $WTC's meeting with #B2W is worthy of note due to the fact that B2W, South America's leading #ecommerce company, have a 50% share of #Brazil's online #retail market.

4333 2018-05-28 13:21:46 China lifting the crypto ban will bring back the bulls. Chinese are mad when it comes to gambling and investment.

4337 2018-05-28 13:21:14 Everyone is now market buying $LTC
4338 2018-05-28 13:21:13 Bitcoin is doomed, because it is poorly designed as a payment system, despite it's first mover advantage.  Crypto-payment blockchains tied to things like the value of the dollar are far superior, criteria paribus.

4343 2018-05-28 13:20:40 Yes that’s a prob—but same prob exists w/ #crypto exchanges today. Bigger prob w/ #securitytokens = vast majority of institutional investors (mutual funds, pension funds, insurers) won’t self-custody. Incumbent custodians won’t touch crypto. So most big investors won’t buy #STOs

4383 2018-05-28 13:15:07 So EOS is dumping their ETH stack, probably in a deliberate attempt to eradicate a competitor. Since the entire crypto space is so correlated, they might end up annihilating the entire crypto market for YEARS. There is no good scenario here for anyone, including EOS.

4420 2018-05-28 13:10:37 One take is that it’s a fear driven attempt to create a sense of control during a period of significant uncertainty. Unfortunately it maintains the fear because it reinforces the inability to tolerate the unknown. It then triggers fears in others and catches on like wild fire.

4424 2018-05-28 13:10:10 I invested lots of fiat into #crypto on today's dip. Although there's many low cap coins I still want to invest in, I've recently put a lot into low cap coins that I'm still waiting to see a positive ROI on. Hence I invested/increased my position in safer coins. #cryptocurrency
4425 2018-05-28 13:10:08 1) crypto makes payments harder not easier
2) yes they failed because it’s too expensive and no-one wants to do it.

Your position seems to be that it would be amazing if it worked, was cheap, and people used it. Well... yes. But none of those is true.. so...
4426 2018-05-28 13:10:07 Investment into crypto reassures the self-fulfilling prophecy that if more investment is poured into it, the new technologies developed from it, will sustain the viability of other currencies.

4515 2018-05-28 12:59:03 A few points you neglected to research, Aliant can convert crypto at point of sale to USD, so at this poine the network is what you are using, in the end you would not hold the volatile assets.  Secondly, the tech is proven, cryptographically and mathematically, adoption ........

4606 2018-05-28 12:47:34 Do you think that in general it is smart to swap around “slightly in the red tokens” for “deep in the red tokens”? Or should not dipping as much also be seen as valuable?

4616 2018-05-28 12:46:31 If you believe P2P crypto solutions will eventually make remittance companies irrelevant, I won't argue it. But don't pretend that has much to do with sensible business strategy today. We need market takers that aren't speculators ASAP.

4717 2018-05-28 12:32:01 Yes, crypto has the potential to disrupt remittances! But the logical thing would be to develop P2P, not B2B, solutions. Ripple themselves state that XRP is developed to be B2B. The XRP people in this thread seem to disagree with that.

4725 2018-05-28 12:31:10 Its so damm easy to make money with crypto, the problem is 90% of people in crypto are those who opened a position and started dreaming of becoming another John McAfee.The hint is in the explorer of each n every coin especially so easy to spot on ether blockchain.

4806 2018-05-28 12:19:02 ... explain the moves and reasons for their predictions in Laymans terms.  Why?  because they claim "Crypto is for the ppl, by the ppl" BS, yet post cryptic language "the ppl" don't always get the meaning of.  I take full responsibility for my trades btw
4807 2018-05-28 12:18:57 Very funny. How can a crypto community be toxic? Wasn’t it you @ArminVanBitcoin, who was starting this thread? Maybe you should concentrate first on the problems around #Bitcoin, before you start critism on other currencies like #IOTA.

4818 2018-05-28 12:17:43 Why would anyone think this is true? They've made profits, yes. But it takes many years to design and tape out a new architecture, and there is no evidence whatsoever that this has been done in the last three years to benefit crypto and not their primary consumer market, gaming.
4819 2018-05-28 12:17:34 That is a BS response, and you know it.  A lot of people DYOR and still get #REKT.  #DYOR means look at all sources, including OGs.

4835 2018-05-28 12:15:50 Timeframes are pretty hard to judge. The moment that $BTC starts to move upwards to the $20.000 region, $STRAT will hit the parabolic. Calculating $STRAT/$BTC all time high with that $BTC price will give you approx. $100 per coin.

I'm not doubting we'll hit that, timeframe idk.

4859 2018-05-28 12:13:13 So you look at Conensus that used to be all about cool new blockchain tech. It was almost exclusively about cool new ways to trade crypto this year. You’ll see that trend continue. The pot of money from Wall St is too big to ignore.

4918 2018-05-28 12:05:07 In the current system lost shares are replaced by issuers — in crypto this will be a bigger problem (just like it is with Bitcoin) 

If stolen it’s another story -this is a beater asset like Bitcoin so whoever holds it owns the keys - it’s up to issuers to decide how to enforce

5127 2018-05-28 11:36:45 Hold #dgb all day long. Unless you are a day trader or short term trader. However I personally dont recommend short term trading crypto. Good luck and enjoy your #Digibyte earnings in the future.

5142 2018-05-28 11:33:38 Hey Tony, hope all your strides are going well. We are all wondering when your ICO will launch in the crypto sphere. I actually had a thought- could a universal token/coin bypass regulators if it were used in the skies? Like a cloud coin for example.

5157 2018-05-28 11:31:09 We saw arguments similar to those against use of crypto in pmts, in tech like VOIP.

5335 2018-05-28 11:03:04 this is literally "NVidia is releasing a new card" and any connection to crypto mining is completely editorialisation and links to others' editorialisation.
5336 2018-05-28 11:03:03 The same applies to the marvelous hashgraph, which reduces the latency through famous nodes but whose creator has stated several times that it cant be applied to crypto due to the need for trust to set up the initial nodes. /2

5427 2018-05-28 10:49:57 That's a fine point. Crypto space lives in a world of early adopters, generally 'responsible' traders and geeks. Small numbers. No mobs. But when it enters the larger world, then it gets more complex. Most of things will be done politically and the anger, the emotion will matter.

5447 2018-05-28 10:46:48 The problems crypto mining is creating for Nvidia are actually quite similar to the problems for power grids. A lot of upfront investment is required to meet the current level of demand, and the risk that the demand evaporated in 6-12 months is high.

more weak hands shakeouts but don't despair - a TSUNAMI of big money is waiting to get in and some of it is bleeding in already

Let weak hands do their thing.

Rule no. 189. Let others keep their reputation/FUD...you keep their latinum/crypto.

6277 2018-05-28 08:30:24 That solicitation should have went out 30-60 days prior. I said 24-48 hours before but that was really describing a absolute bare bones minimum. The 30-60 day notification period is not what I feel it should have been but industry standard!

6489 2018-05-28 07:57:10 For a crypto-currency to be useful, users need to be able to reasonably use it. 1 transaction a month _feels_ to me like a useless crypto-currency.  12 people can execute a transfer per year. 24/year is notably better and the reduction in security is small enough to be worth it.

50nlは若干の勝ち越しですけど（笑）
たまたま勝てているだけでこれからもアドバイスよろしくお願いします
自分の知らない打ち方や方法をどんどん増やして強くなりたいです。
今勝てても幅広げないといずれ通用しないですからね。

Credit card companies should be able to block crypto transactions.

6729 2018-05-28 07:21:10 I agree. Indicators are saying that we are slowing down and I have your same value as a possible reversal point. I see smart money waiting outside and now the price is reaching their optimal level of buying. IMO one last week of pain and we are ready to go.

6738 2018-05-28 07:19:54 Very simply put.  China wants its people to have at least average life for all its citizens, better health, and secure food and trade resources through their silk road project. Letting other people produce cheaply for them. Also shift population from east to west due to congest.

6858 2018-05-28 07:01:00 danycryptokid That's fair. I maybe should have put more thought in before posting, or not have posted at all.
6859 2018-05-28 07:00:59 TeamWinnaar Xentagz It wasn't a popularity comparison, I was trying to show how different forks were at war with each other. Trying to highlight the political struggle, not the most popular hard-forked coin.
6860 2018-05-28 07:00:59 danycryptokid Ugh, I could have known ppl were going to fall over this... I omitted that one because it made the other trends less visible, just like why I omitted "bitcoin" also.
6861 2018-05-28 07:00:58 TeamWinnaar Xentagz What am I omitting? That "bitcoin cash" is the more popular search result? There's always bias in selection when making graphs.
6862 2018-05-28 07:00:58 TeamWinnaar Xentagz So after doing away with segwit (malleability fix SF) = reintroducing malleability bug) they then partially fixed malleability with a hard-fork.
6863 2018-05-28 07:00:57 TeamWinnaar Xentagz You didn't name lies that I spread

Im taking your advice Bob, but i think it would help a lot of your followers if you gave an updated chart of your predictions, 2 days is a long time in the crypto world
6866 2018-05-28 07:00:56 adcustom Imo relevance is quite subjective. Respect your opinion though.
6867 2018-05-28 07:00:55 adcustom Some, I guess, in function of what it says about Bitcoin sentiment. Do you find me posting about it offensive?
6868 2018-05-28 07:00:53 RT CryptoShillNye: If you’re still in $crypto after you’ve:

Regulate favorable, we will pay btc. When you regulate favorable, btc grows in value.

Don't worry about the others. They can paper trade your ideas until they are comfortable. 

I totally agree, it's nice to get other opinions but at the end of the day you need to own your own trade so that you can react to a fluid situation

7721 2018-05-28 04:38:39 ここで個別の効率化だけを考えると
「ほかの作業をしながらAさんを待ち、
Aさんと一緒に20分で終わらせる」といった行動をとります。
　
しかし、全体を最短で終わらせることを考えるなら
「40分かかっても一人で生地をつくる」が
間違いなく最短へ繋がる答えになるのです。

7724 2018-05-28 04:38:29 生地をつくるという工程において
1人で作業を行えば40分程かかりますが、
　
AさんBさん一緒に行えば20分で済むとします。
　
しかしAさんは別の作業をしていて、
その作業が終わるのを待つと一時間以上かかります。

7738 2018-05-28 04:36:36 例えば
作ったら売れるパン屋さんがあるとして、
「生地を作る」「パンを焼く」「販売する」という
工程があります。

売りたいのに、販売速度が追いつかない
ならば「販売する」がボトルネックです。
7739 2018-05-28 04:36:12 そして、ここで重要なのが
「ボトルネック」を把握することです。

ここで言うボトルネックとは
「物事を進める際に、全体の進行速度を決めている部分」
ということです。

このボトルネックを把握し、
それを改善することで全体の効率があがるのです。

7767 2018-05-28 04:31:40 I'm not so sure about that.  Some altcoins out there exist to solve one problem or another that bitcoin has within itself as a technology or a currency.  Not saying there isn't actually "shit"coins out there, but to write off all altcoins that way is shortsighted.

7886 2018-05-28 04:03:27 Something like saying “issuers can decide to delete your shares or blacklist you if they want” seems instantly at odds with Bitcoin / real crypto — but issuers are not the problem - if we worried they’d mistreat us we wouldn’t invest in that stock

8156 2018-05-28 03:07:37 It amazes me that 1. the big cap crypto follower accounts can’t get a small cap to pump even when they team up. 2. They are making an attempt to do so knowing we are in a bear market. Don’t buy $SNTR.  Im out of all crypto to neutral right now besides a select few like $hkn.

8202 2018-05-28 02:58:05 SCI Daily Crypto Digest: Steady Weekend. Bitcoin (BTC) was relatively calm over the weekend, trading within a tighter range and avoiding sharp moves. The consolidation at the lows is bearish as it tends to continue the previous trend which, in this case is a downtrend.
8203 2018-05-28 02:58:04 The main reason vendors don’t have these arrangements is cost. If crypto was more stable this would alleviate the problem... until Telstra/Optus went down...

8268 2018-05-28 02:39:49 It’s not that it’s undervalued! It’s just that the world is still getting use to the idea of crypto, POS vs POW, coin supply, etc. Not to mention anonymity! Linda’s time will come especially if the devs stay honest, uphold anonymity and keep POS! Still a good time to stock!

8272 2018-05-28 02:39:32 Who say BTC can’t be use on Day to day transcation. I use it to buy things and even sell things for bitcoin. I don’t have problem with that. Many crypto can use as day to day is where you want to use it yourself.

8276 2018-05-28 02:39:03 Historically console devs are fucking stupid about assuming that just because it's embedded means it's secure. The device is in an insecure, untrusted user's hand's and provisioned with crypto secrets that last until EoL, always assume it's compromised day 1.

8281 2018-05-28 02:38:09 Past the "bankers coin" nonsense to what is truly going on beneath the surface. If any crypto is going to destroy the banking cartel, it's the one that gets inside the current system and adopted by the hapless small players, forcing the big players to fall in line. Brilliant.

8335 2018-05-28 02:21:56 That's a fair point, but it's more deeply concerning that the economics of SV startups might have lead to the vast lapse in programmer professional ethics that seems to pervade this crypto nonsense.

8348 2018-05-28 02:17:20 I think cryptocurrency is strong because the old paths to tech wealth have all failed, now that 90+% of startups are frauds run by MBAs and offering 0.05%. The only people who got rich did so via crypto (not to say the latter has long-term merit; that I tend to doubt).

8408 2018-05-28 02:04:25 What about someone that does not have a secret bank account or deal with crypto currency nor wants another possible trail to get caught but has a very good reputation?  Maybe that should be a question in the screening process.

8410 2018-05-28 02:03:37 @KoronaCoin This platform is a prime example of what a future crypto-world might look like. For cryptocurrency to pick up massive adoption, in the long run, a variety of use cases and value propositions is necessary.

8419 2018-05-28 02:01:11 I don’t consider bitcoin as a store of value even when I want to move my funds from one exchange to another exchange. I check which coin is in uptrend to make sure I don’t lose out. I mean who in their right mind will consider highly volatile crypto as a store of value ?

8458 2018-05-28 01:54:20 Not sure if the words "online" and "secure" go together. I heard their holdings are insured, but I still wouldn't trust ANYONE to hold my crypto. Why take the chance? Get a Ledger Nano S!

8460 2018-05-28 01:54:07 Also, if state has to take crypto down why would they target EOS?? If EOS dies crypto will still live. But if BTC dies, crypto will be done for a long time.
8461 2018-05-28 01:54:03 Yeah Crypto is risky. The smart ones take the highest risk lowest reward? Why do people even bother to mess with XVG? A lot more risk with the same chance at reward as lets say Stellar or Litecoin.

8511 2018-05-28 01:43:14 The entire crypto market is in major recession. BCH's price is tied to BTC's price because they both mine SHA256,, so the BCHBTC ratio is always balanced around % profitability to mine.

8595 2018-05-28 01:24:50 These all points to iliquid markets with very thin orderbooks where little buying/selling pressure generates a big moves. Seeing "Barts" out of crypto is highly unusual. Signs of a not very "healthy" market.

8877 2018-05-28 00:28:53 The inability of the "crypto economy" to go beyond the constant development of "crypto assets" is a reflection of the useless focus on the blockchain economy, instead of Bitcoin economy. Trade in crypto assets needs to give way to trade in digital services facilitated by Bitcoin.
8878 2018-05-28 00:28:40 You say “should” as if he was put on trial and judged to be guilty of some crime by a jury of his peers, when in fact that has never happened. Even the 4 bankruptcies of 4 individual businesses is not criminal or illegal.
