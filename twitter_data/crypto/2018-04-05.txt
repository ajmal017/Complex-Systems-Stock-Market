44 2018-04-05 23:55:38 So we know that Ripple is trying its best to implement its announced goal: to make XRP more liquid and thus better to become a value medium. Given the huge influence of coinbase, this price is worth it.
45 2018-04-05 23:55:36 I wonder if the lack of respondents is a function of a down market or from an inability to correlate the incredible advantages @shopinapp will ultimately provide the massive retail space?

53 2018-04-05 23:54:54 $ICX is very oversold right now. I am re-entering at $2. People are very quick to forget, it was $4 just last week. Low risk/high upside trade going into April with token swap and ICO’s launching off the platform. Goal is $5+
54 2018-04-05 23:54:29 Trading has a very very high failure rate. Maybe newbies will finally get its even higher in crypto with stuff like this

95 2018-04-05 23:47:33 This is fud and rubbish. If someone makes alot of money in crypto they should allocate some to pay tax. Take responsibility for your actions. Instead of being a victim at the end because of your recklessness to treat the whole gain like tattslotto incorrectly

103 2018-04-05 23:46:05 This is what I can’t wrap my head around... there will never be anyone stopping crypto - it’s over. The game has changed already these old ppl are clueless and terrified; it’s only going to get worse for them.

127 2018-04-05 23:43:50 You bought Verge on an exchange because you were hoping to make some money. I hate to say it, but it is the wrong reason to get behind the project. Worrying about money never helped anything grow, you should be part of the revolution. #XVG #Crypto #HODL #VergeFam #BTC #Verge

130 2018-04-05 23:43:07 Thats true.. But then I feel like there will always be detractors. I believe over time as crypto is so resilient it will force people to support it. But so many willing to just call it a scheme. I understand, it is a lot to research to discover why it is valuable.

157 2018-04-05 23:39:28 For anyone trying to understand what Coinbase announcement was; it wasn’t the addition of a random shit coin but rather venture capital backed crypto
158 2018-04-05 23:39:21 Just create wallets for all the crypto-currencies and then list them online as just the hashes without any mention of which is which. Really mess with the crypto-currency people.

I know this is weird but i like the fact that i can see the faces of people i talk and chat with..

167 2018-04-05 23:37:56 I guess the Caste system in India shall keep going for generation to come! That is the reason they banned crypto of course.

183 2018-04-05 23:36:24 Is $SALT a good #crypto ?
184 2018-04-05 23:36:09 Chess, not checkers bloomberg. Why play a childs game when the real money has way more zeros than @coinbase. + @GeminiDotCom #CFE and #CBIDX are continually becoming bottom shelf global exchanges. The US is falling behind in Crypto. *Albatros attempt failed* see ya tomorrow.
185 2018-04-05 23:36:02 Great! #WorldWifi that you have created a guide how to participate in the sale of #WeToken. It can also be useful to buy another #cryptocurrency and a great help for the crypto-enthusiast without experience. I would also recommend that you create an article on @Medium  #SEO 
186 2018-04-05 23:35:51 Is this supposed to be a good thing? Lol

198 2018-04-05 23:33:54 Crypto might just be the most ego-bloating, fantastic, most joyful money-making experience whilst also beeing the most frustrating, nerv wrecking, punishing and humbling experience at the same time. You‘re forced to learn, to adapt, to endure, but in the end you‘ll succeed

228 2018-04-05 23:29:15 Thanks for sharing. The more I read about EOS the more I fall in love with it. I don't own any yet but feel like i should trade all my alts for EOS, move to cold storage and revisit the world of crypto in 6 months when the FUD has died down a bit :)
229 2018-04-05 23:29:15 I have yet to meet any actual bch fan in real life.  Everyone I meet in crypto gives numerous reasons why they dislike it. Even at monero meetups I attend, those I meet bash bch and either own or are apathetic to btc.
230 2018-04-05 23:29:10 Not in the US. You pay the lower capital gains rate, which for most people will be 15%-20% depending on income bracket.

241 2018-04-05 23:27:00 This is incorrect. The firm I use to handle my taxes is calculating them by tracking all activities on the addresses. The US government can do that, too.

255 2018-04-05 23:24:51 Coinbase, for sure, is going to report purchases. Don’t know if any exchanges will report anything. But even if they don’t, you’re betting on not getting caught. I hate taxes as much as everyone but I’d rather be able to sleep well knowing I can’t go to jail later.
256 2018-04-05 23:24:47 A little overboard there buddy 
257 2018-04-05 23:24:45 Lol you sound super triggered, snowflake.

269 2018-04-05 23:23:02 RBI Bank transaction with crypto in India yesterday.
270 2018-04-05 23:22:56 The only reason crypto currencies/assets work is because of blockchain so it's not useless constrains
271 2018-04-05 23:22:32 There is so much #FUD surrounding @Ripple .
Step back and ask yourself this: Without debate about is it a crypto, is it decentralized, etc...Does the #Ripple plan for the use of $XRP to streamline payments make logical sense?
My answer is yes...and that's where it finds value.
272 2018-04-05 23:22:30 Dont forget the $BTCP crowd
273 2018-04-05 23:22:29 Some have been asking.. The #Crypto I am the most bullish on at these levels almost completely regardless of what the market does next 6months --> $BNB

This coin is engineered to trade higher due to float shrink, use grows as market volatility inc & binance market share grows
274 2018-04-05 23:22:27 Where would you invest your money right now, Stocks, Bonds and Mutual Funds or Crypto Currency? Leave a feedback so we can see what people are really feeling.
275 2018-04-05 23:22:18 Addition: $IOC is going stealth soon 85% ready and the Chameleon sidechain is coming in Q4 - could get really interesting due I/O Coin flies still under the radars... Super bullish here longterm
276 2018-04-05 23:22:17 lol John no matter how much shit you get from Crypto remember we love you and any input you contribute to this space.
277 2018-04-05 23:22:12 More like 0% gain after taxes

And therefore he will have many supporters and partners. Of course, this is very exciting and inspiring!
281 2018-04-05 23:21:48 What?? There's more than one fool out there that used the same meme??

That's what I'm talking about.

PATHETIC??
282 2018-04-05 23:21:44 i do not know what happens next buds...i would say sideways for a while to confuse bulls and bears, but i am of the opinion LTC is spring loading for a move higher later in year!!, anything is possible...this is crypto.
283 2018-04-05 23:21:40 I'm not 100% sure on that. If you had to no idea about forks and you just held all your Bitcoin on coinbase you will prob get btcp. I don't know if this is the case. Has anyone ruled it out? Kucoin for example gave btcp to btc holders during fork
284 2018-04-05 23:21:05 Needs way more misspellings and profanity.

288 2018-04-05 23:20:14 how else do u move fiat money into crypto?? only through exchanges like coinbase! or mining but 90% of the people dont want to do that
289 2018-04-05 23:20:07 It's the only site everyone in crypto knows about. From the newest person who just bought 0.00001 BTC to satoshi himself.

293 2018-04-05 23:19:26 No, trading is legal, wallets are legal, owning it is legal, selling is legal, buying is legal. It's just all cash, offshore accounts or crypto-to-crypto (for now).

Was amazing end to awesome crypto party night.
304 2018-04-05 23:17:50 I said if you day trade crypto now you get rekt.  Too many non technical things happening that you cannot predict.  You can get lucky.  You can't chart this stuff out.  Not yet.  Dude stop being silly.  You can't tell what this will do over the next 30 days.  That is my criticism

310 2018-04-05 23:17:04 True story: Had a crypto party at a bar. Cop showed up. He wasn’t welcomed. A local female patron defended him waiting for people to leave to pull over. After 30 mins of teasing her I decided to “REEEEEEEEEE” at her very loud in front of dozen people and she ran back inside....
311 2018-04-05 23:16:43 @TheCryptoDog All jokes aside. Wouldn't this just be as bad news for Crypto as a whole?
312 2018-04-05 23:16:43 He's talking about Indian banks banning crypto transactions.. they can't control how we spend our money.. the more reason Bitcoin needs to exist!

343 2018-04-05 23:13:05 I’m talking about the advancements and products. The coinbase commerce that helps with merchant payments is a big deal. I’m not talking about the individual currency side of it. When people in the US consider buying crypto, they go to coinbase. That’s a good thing for us.

353 2018-04-05 23:10:47 Interestingly, holding crypto is not taxable until it is sold because the IRS treats it like property.

355 2018-04-05 23:10:35 Did you ever try blur?  I have been using them for a long time and really love them, but I'm in the process of switching everything over to the new brave browser.  They literally support like every password manager except blur.  Might just need to import stuff into another one.

357 2018-04-05 23:10:23 Wait if youre so good at researching and investing into crypto im sure you'd be able to pay for that yourself. Guess not. Funny thing is that now youre wrong you actually want to fight me. But honestly it wouldnt be fair fighting a lil midget tho

360 2018-04-05 23:09:58 @CNBCFastMoney @cnbcdiaz You dropped the Karen Finerman Fastpitch segment? In my opinion too much time spent on crypto and e-sports recently. I fast forward through those segments now.

374 2018-04-05 23:08:07 I am though, impressed by the amount of #BitcoinCash #BCH conferences going around. For a global crypto-currency, you have to count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 seconds and THEN a new TX happens. It feels like it's a show put on to trick merchants into a technology that has "no" usage at all
375 2018-04-05 23:08:07 I feel young and very emotionally imature if that counts towards being young, I'm like 16 years old. lol My background is pharma, so as the crypto noob I get to cross dress into that sarcastic side. lol

377 2018-04-05 23:08:04 Amon allows you to save money by optimizing your expenses during payment. The crypto currency market is so volatile that is hard to know which crypto currency will maximize value to the user while making real time payment.. #AmonCard #ICO #TokenSale #CryptoCard
378 2018-04-05 23:07:46 As Zach said, you cannot blame others for your own misadventures in Crypto. If you sold THC at a loss, thats on you, not us. You dont lose until YOU decide to sell at a loss, especially in a temporary bear market. Crypto is a volatile industry, everything has dropped. DYOR!
379 2018-04-05 23:07:41 Haha this is so funny my little man, another lil' chuckle there. Saw one of your rap vids the other day, funny af as well. If you'd only put half the effort in your crypto research you'd actually be right some day  goodbye my lil dude

403 2018-04-05 23:03:07 That’s what I mean..

Here in the Netherlands alone there’s already like 10 different websites that allow me to do that

And from every European $Crypto exchange I can transfer fiat directly into my bank account within 12 hours

So I ask again, what’s so special about @coinbase ?
404 2018-04-05 23:02:55 He's just mad he got caught!

417 2018-04-05 23:01:23 well, if Mr. Brees original net worth were north of $180,000,000 then plunging $9,000,000 into diamonds, crypto, or the horses would be a fine diversification play.
418 2018-04-05 23:01:09 Things you can do to create value in crypto:
1. Build secure storage/wallets 
2. Talk to small business about accepting $crypto #btc #ltc #eth 
3. Build a coin that actually has a working product in real life scenarios
4. Tell a friend about crypto

440 2018-04-05 22:59:31 I do read/skim. I'd suggest friendlier email subjects (with summary) and to half the length. I follow crypto but I think this assumes more bg knowledge than I have. The "why it's important sections" are . Lead with/only have them.
441 2018-04-05 22:59:25 In my opinion, this needed to happen since current customers do not own their private key. However this move will spawn a new wave of BTC forked assets, which may not be good for the Crypto movement as a whole. #bitcoin #cryptocurrency

450 2018-04-05 22:58:21 Good!  In order for new investors to start putting money into the crypto world, they need to know that they are safe and protected. It's initiatives like this that will provide the masses with peace of mind. In it's current state, cryptos are extremely risky to the average person
451 2018-04-05 22:58:05 Do you hate money? You can still make gainz off of shit like $XVG, $XRP, and $TRX.

Dont hold these coins, but shoot, trading them is fine. Your loss
452 2018-04-05 22:57:52 It’s curious that every Trump supporter or #Cult45 member I talk to says they don’t get their info from #FauxNews while they consistently echo their talking points.  They sure don’t get their news from any factual sources.

Good to know this is what you're really like.
506 2018-04-05 22:51:21 And then to add to that the conversation that the first relative 50 % of value/excess transfer into crypto will have a net positive value effect on their i.o.u.s... and the last value transfer which will be from a lack of better word the popularity effect... will have a net loss

522 2018-04-05 22:49:11 Short vol bubble, nobody knew what volatility was, but traded it anyways.

Real estate bubble, people encouraged to finance homes they couldn’t afford.

Crypto bubble, anyone could dump thousands of dollars on an unregulated line of code, using their credit cards.

That’s why.

556 2018-04-05 22:43:23 ..and y’all thought that stash was a Twitter handle gimmick??! It’s REAL BABY IT’S REAL!!
557 2018-04-05 22:43:18 If bch is so good then why is the price trend always following bitcoin. Don’t get me wrong, I agree with you that bch is far more superior but why doesn’t it go out on its own. Is this the usual thing with crypto currencies.
558 2018-04-05 22:43:06 As soon as projects/innovators can abstract crypto use to everyday individuals (think your aunts and uncles), the space will see rapid growth and adoption. Until then, good luck waiting for 'take-off' and 'lambo'. Economic friction is much stronger than before.

561 2018-04-05 22:42:52 That is the problem with crypto world. Get active in social media, participate in forums enough to get involved in ICOs, attend conferences/events, invest $200 into cryptos, etc. And before you know it, you’re a Top100 crypto entrepreneur to watch!!!

A young market
A wild market
An exciting market
A challenging I market
Always something to learn around the corner. For me it is a wake up call, to media, to finance, to privacy, to transparency, to freedom...

Good night.
565 2018-04-05 22:41:36 @RBI This is how you are promoting digital India by banning crypto currency ?? If you are so much concerned about our hard earned money being at risk then why have you not banned share market and mutual funds, they all are subjected to market risk! Anyways we are against it!

globally, but especially in Africa, to help themselves.

569 2018-04-05 22:40:49 Yeah but common man, i know to disregard people who are obviously biased. 

I still maintain my point has nothing to do with justification. 

I am literally the other black guy in crypto (don't deny it you're one of us) i won't just discrimination towards my people.

574 2018-04-05 22:39:43 For shizzle my nizzle. We need to be sincere. Crypto is not ready for peeps living in extreme poverty. I don't know what they need, but it seems to be food, medicine and education are more needed than cheap transactions. Let's be sincere. Samson has a point
575 2018-04-05 22:39:39 Or network growth... obviously its money up front/equity. It creates skin in the game for coinbase, who now just accepted all forks onto the network. Where does capital for talent come from, an ICO? Genuinely, cryptocurrencies is a community. Govt currency will be supreme
576 2018-04-05 22:39:39 Will do! Thank you! Also, thank you for creating such an awesome @CommerceCB platform! Keep up the great work! Crypto all the things! :)

Remember the more time we have the better. 

Most of you won't understand that.
593 2018-04-05 22:36:08 I post charts all the time, you still like me 
594 2018-04-05 22:35:55 just ask I want to pay by crypto do you accept? If no is the answer ? Move to the next one. This is how we can create awareness, slowly but steadily.

602 2018-04-05 22:34:57 Thanks for the Retweet. I was looking for a book on this today and poof, you directed me to the person! My hopes for being successful in the crypto world keeps increasing with every new person I get to follow. I love the community feel!

611 2018-04-05 22:33:48 Sell is what weak hands do. All these people shorting every coin on the market and wondering foolishly, why no moon, why no lambo  #hodlife IMO, shorting is anti-crypto.
612 2018-04-05 22:33:43 "NOTHING justifies RACISM but thanks 4 trying 2 justify it ur what's wrong with #crypto right there " 

Take this tweet for example, how is this not an angry state of mind. 

You seem to pick a fight with literally eveyone. 

And you don't read when people are being mellow.
613 2018-04-05 22:33:34 Me too. But it's fine. I'm not one of these impatient crypto bros. I can wait months or years for a 10x. Roadmap goals and big announcements will bring up the price. More time to accumulate.
614 2018-04-05 22:33:33 XRP is not a crypto coin like bit. It’s a completely different concept. I don’t think you understand it completely. Hence, your comment doesn’t mean anything!

If #DigiByte can say that it cannot happen on their block-chain, would they be willing to back that up with a guarantee?

685 2018-04-05 22:24:45 Ripple is not suitable for Coinbase as per Coinbases business philosophy.  Stop having temper tantrums. You bought ripple because it was cheap and you have rage fits because Coinbase wont add it.  Its never going to be added to Coinbase. Its not a crypto. Buy a coin that matters.

688 2018-04-05 22:24:14 Seriously dont understand this move this early in the game. Basically since all their crypto rises and falls with the movement of BTC you get to lose money in all 4 coins instead of one wheeeee
689 2018-04-05 22:24:12 Nara lokesh If you want popularity! Question RBI why they banned crypto!!
690 2018-04-05 22:23:57 It was listed on new exchanges, its normal. I somehow doubt TA works that good in crypto ...

693 2018-04-05 22:23:22 Tokenpay.  Screenshot this.  And remember it was already essentially announced 3 months ago.   This dev team... just wow.
694 2018-04-05 22:23:20 Q1 of this year, the crypto market has lost a little over 48% of its January 1st value.  close on March 31st.
695 2018-04-05 22:23:05 I love Johnny's one liner and phil's ranting and his dog. Choe seems to be sincere no nonsense guy !!   Disclaimer - I'm not human adviser and its my perception to see people :-)
696 2018-04-05 22:22:55 You could have announced that on twitter/blog, then gone over highlights on cnbc.  I feel like you pumped everyone's excitement for an announcement that is .. well.. good for the crypto world, but not as exciting as most of us were ready for.  PS: Watch out for @AbraGlobal 
697 2018-04-05 22:22:55 I'm being serious. It is idiotic, and my instinct was to make fun of it. But I'm genuinely curious so I want to pick your brain. You don't like our system- I'm curious what your alternative solution is.

700 2018-04-05 22:22:30 one thing that makes me sleep well at night is knowing all the scammers, manipulators, and tirade filled hot heads in crypto are going to rot in hell from their abusive tweets & actions. burn baby burn.

728 2018-04-05 22:18:45 Another sign that #Coinbase is close to announcing the addition of new crypto coins on their platform.  Actually they have to because of what #Abra is doing and other potential competitors in the industry. #SenseOfUrgency
729 2018-04-05 22:18:38 gracias bro.
730 2018-04-05 22:18:26 Stop talking Nonsense please $XRP is not real #Crypto and is Centralized. Even if the #SEC comes out with clear regulatory guidelines I doubt that @coinbase would list such bad project.

775 2018-04-05 22:14:18 @crypto_bobby @carterthomas 3 months into this market, i could tell todays coinbase announcement isn’t about adding any coin. Wtf is going on here. I mean duh. SEC isn’t going to keep that thing a secret and if you know how government works we would hear mumblings already.
776 2018-04-05 22:14:14 That dipshit from coinbase on cnbc doesn't think xrp is regulated more the btc. Really! Its the best crypto to survive all the coming regulations cause its helping the banking industries border to border payments to be faster and cheaper!
777 2018-04-05 22:14:03 Buddy... I'm Venezuelan. I've seen people living in less than $2/day or $7 and they don't need BTC or any other crypto. This is a pipedream that somebody living in less than $2 can have a cellphone and have the knowledge to handle crypto

781 2018-04-05 22:13:57 Just look at the @. It's a FAKE account and sadly, @AleksandarBoh  fell for it. You see these bull shit giveaways EVERYWHERE on Crypto feeds, and sadly, A LOT of people fall for them
782 2018-04-05 22:13:50 This is exactly my point KAZ, my reply wasn't a justification and its not meant to be. But your response is instantly overkill. 

Look at all your followers who are attacking me in this thread  rn, am i replying with overkill insults? No.

792 2018-04-05 22:12:58 I never understand these arguments against coinbase. Without them, crypto would still be in the dark.
793 2018-04-05 22:12:53 my love is not mutual? I left a twitter account that led for 8 years, and started a new one for the crypt. I consider you to be a family, honestly
794 2018-04-05 22:12:44 Looks like a bunch of people leaving one terrible currency to another!
795 2018-04-05 22:12:41 Prediction: The coin that @coinbase adds will have a market cap of at least $1 Billion.

Sorry, they arent gonna list ur fav coin worth a measly $200 mill.....
796 2018-04-05 22:12:41 Cant promise a date yet but shouldnt take more than a few days :)
797 2018-04-05 22:12:35 Crypto currency made Graphics cards skyrocket in price. Top of the line graphics cards went from 700 a pop to 1500. Slowly going down with the decrease in price of Bitcoin, but it's shitty rn. 
798 2018-04-05 22:12:31 Soon Coinbase is not going to be the only user friendly exchange for new crypto buyers. If they don’t keep up by adding altcoin or they’ll be left behind.
799 2018-04-05 22:12:28 Also if you find out about a Korean exchange listing the moment it is announced, you should market buy
800 2018-04-05 22:12:28 definitely dead money for a while. bitcoin and crypto is not going anywhere in 2018 until governments clarify what exactly it is and create regulatory laws about it
801 2018-04-05 22:12:18 To Sarah's credit, it was a question, not a statement. It does create FUD, but sometimes FUD is warranted (but I'm not implying it is for $XVG)

807 2018-04-05 22:11:58 I like what I’m seeing in the  #crypto community lately. Companies are beginning push for all others in the space to step up and run transparent, compliant businesses. Authenticity by peer pressure #dontgotojail #dontbeanasshole #transparentmarkerting – bij Hudson Loft
808 2018-04-05 22:11:47 Does this mean crypto is about to come back?

813 2018-04-05 22:11:08 
814 2018-04-05 22:11:05 Or even back in December they could have warned that fees cost $20-$50 per btc transactions thus could have lowered their fees to adapt to the network/market... #coinbase fails #crypto #bitcoin #blockchain #litecoin #ethereum
815 2018-04-05 22:10:58 People do get touchy about their money, but thats where it gets muddy. To say that Verge owners are just touchy with their money discredits the actual achievements that the dev team has accomplished. At a time where WE ALL want crypto to take flight, it's disappointing to see.

827 2018-04-05 22:09:36 I suspect knowing your own weaknesses is as important as learning about TA & FA in this space. Everyone makes mistakes. It's whether we can retrain ourselves to avoid making the same ones repeatedly that will determine success in crypto. You're self-aware. You're half way there.

829 2018-04-05 22:09:28 I bought some then sold it cause of an article I found. Also, I can’t research the team due to lack of detail on the website (no full names but one). The crypto community speaks poorly about this project =( . Believe me I wanted this to be true sooo bad, I was rooting for it
830 2018-04-05 22:09:20 They also announced the establishment of a venture fund (currently $15M if I recall correctly) to help fund young companies in the crypto world. (Companies only, NOT currencies, to avoid possible conflict of interest).
But yes....these companies need to stop hyping beforehand
831 2018-04-05 22:09:18 You are celebrity of #crypto twitter world. Ignore haters and see nice people like @ValCoins @CryptoVanessa @cryptoaddict86 @LisaNEdwards around. Fun people like @AltOne_Crypto @PhilakoneCrypto @CryptoChoe. Life is good ....No complains dude!!
832 2018-04-05 22:09:18 Dont’t understand, get the hell out of crypto or shut up to those haters...#HODLgang is not for them. Golddiggers and junkies they are and Looking for a quick fix...

840 2018-04-05 22:08:54 Answering to @jeffhillmolr and Sekundar at the same time: XRP is NOT a currency. And the danger is that the (inevitable) failure of Ripple can and will damage crypto industry at regulation and public opinion levels.

855 2018-04-05 22:06:41 Ha ha ha. You keep announcing crap. If you had anything other than a complete monopoly of the US dollar into crypto you’d be out of business already. Your time is short
856 2018-04-05 22:06:38 Hi guys, This project has a lot of potential to go high in the crypto world. The mindset and everything is set to make it one of the best #TradePlayz #ZedToken
857 2018-04-05 22:06:15 I'm in!!

I'm curious, how can you afford to giveaway so much Crypto currency on a daily basis?
858 2018-04-05 22:06:14 You used to be a easy gateway into crypto for thousands of people,  now I have no idea what you are trying to be.
859 2018-04-05 22:06:12 Except with crypto, you don't buy tech, you buy hot air. And when it cools off, it's just, thin air. Good luck to all "investors"
860 2018-04-05 22:06:11 You act like no other companies or devs see the value in xrp lol. Why do you think R3 is seeing ripple to get xrp. Come on think critically I know it's hard... so what happens to BTC/alts without devs? Ooops 
861 2018-04-05 22:06:08 It's a buyers market for mining rigs, not a sellers market so not retailing, my crypto pal just scored a spot 12k sq feet and 1600amp, looking good

864 2018-04-05 22:05:50 XRP isn’t even crypto it’s a centralized token and it’s trash. Whole point of crypto was to take the power from the banks and you want to support the banks version of “crypto”

Announce new criptos...that is real announcements
889 2018-04-05 22:02:39 @coinbase is just hyping the market, and not doing anything to help the crypto industry! @CNBCFastMoney you are only helping them hype the market and many new people are getting hurt! Both of you should be ashamed of yourself!
890 2018-04-05 22:02:38 Looking at the crypto landscape and where we are in the market cycle, Ripple's XRP looks great value for the more cautious investor. A great risk/reward ratio considering current price and volume of positive news/new partnerships. $XRP $BTC $LTC $BCH $ETH $XVG $NEO $EOS $BNB

937 2018-04-05 21:57:20 you added yourself to this conversation and are complaining about the conversation you invited yourself too ... please mute us... ty
938 2018-04-05 21:57:14 #coinbase has established a venture fund to help fund up-and-coming companies building platforms that utilize #cryptocurrency / #blockchain tech. They specifically stated they would NOT be investing in any currencies with this fund. #crypto
939 2018-04-05 21:57:05 All you scrubs just want you coin listed so you can get a pump. This is HUGE.
940 2018-04-05 21:57:05 5) What you want to do is diversify your portfolio so that when you’re wrong you don’t lose much but when you’re right you still make decent gains. This is how you survive as a trader.
941 2018-04-05 21:56:53 Coinbase announcements are almost as eventful as Justin  Suns $TRX #Coinbase
942 2018-04-05 21:56:42 pretty big news as it is my understanding that this opens the doors for assets managers for larger institutions to offer their clients a secure crypto fund with an established licensed, insured company.
943 2018-04-05 21:56:40 Really enjoying your TA dude, not biased and you support all crypto #Respect 
944 2018-04-05 21:56:39 bethereumteam: Jean_Jaki BEthereum Will be announced ;) we're already thinking of a few locations!
945 2018-04-05 21:56:23 4) One of the best pieces of advice they will give is to diversify your portfolio. No trader is right all the time. Most are right only slightly more often than you or me, if at all.
946 2018-04-05 21:56:17 Sorry for your loss. Sending my thoughts and prayers
947 2018-04-05 21:56:16 India’s central bank RBI moves towards a country wide crypto shut out. Those who fight innovation and the tokenization of the world will be the ones that get left behind.
948 2018-04-05 21:56:13 If #BTC  can hold above $6600 I could see a consolidation slowly but surely up... then all of a sudden news becomes overwhelmingly crypto positive  I m optimistic long term so not to worried about bumps and dumps along the way
949 2018-04-05 21:56:11 Btcp pump and dump incoming?
950 2018-04-05 21:56:10 I'm just waiting for the crypto market to be big enough to be profitable for the big HFT/market making players like Citadel or Virtu. Let's see what happens then.
951 2018-04-05 21:55:52 Article was from 6 months ago
952 2018-04-05 21:55:49 Could be PayPal, I mean they are specialized in modern and efficient payment. And let us not forget that everything has its alpha, beta etc test phases you gotta start somewhere right? They don't want to miss the train so they just give it a shot, PP alrdy once changed the world.
953 2018-04-05 21:55:47 Sh*t on $XRP as much as you like, but you’d be an idiot not to have a little bag of it. Signed up over 100+ banks so far. Could be the first Visa/MasterCard/Amex approved crypto.
954 2018-04-05 21:55:40 its funny how you take a random date on crypto that actually has no 'year end' or 'report' - if you take another date, say 17th of december, all numbers change again. if you compare the market to the last time we had 250bil  - you also get a different view. Why push this through?
955 2018-04-05 21:55:37 The stock market is not doing well we might see some money from there come to crypto soon .. I expert this volatile situation to last

966 2018-04-05 21:55:10 NOTHING is getting listed until the SEC speaks up about regulations.  Hopefully for TRX holders, main net will be out by then.  If not, RIP.
967 2018-04-05 21:55:07 where is privacy? My account got hacked and I mailed you many times, but you guys replied always with sympathy.

Even I suggested changing something like make a password while transferring tokens to other address. The pathetic wallet I have ever seen. #crypto #ICOBench #token

972 2018-04-05 21:54:26 All is well. Nothing major.

974 2018-04-05 21:54:21 Also, isnt it tax free if you hold it for 1+ year?

977 2018-04-05 21:54:11 @coinbase are releasing their own coin in partnership with @CNBCFastMoney 

Introducing #HypeCoin !

Capable of x1500 more hype than any other #crypto

Prepare for the pre-announcement of the ICO which will be announced by @justinsuntron in his 4th pre-pre-announcement 
#bitcoin
978 2018-04-05 21:53:55 I would like to announce that soon I will be announcing something that you may find interesting.
979 2018-04-05 21:53:47 i'm guessing a small company that won't stir headlines, don't they have a major issue going on now with a hack?
980 2018-04-05 21:53:47 They announced they are launching a new crypto venture fund that will be investing in start up projects (not coins).
981 2018-04-05 21:53:46 CEO of #Coinbase states they are in process of investing in #cryptocurrency companies to improve and push forward the ecosystem. BIG.

983 2018-04-05 21:53:19 It’s a quote from Fight Club, I can’t claim for where chuck it from but it rings true. Certainly for crypto.
984 2018-04-05 21:53:08 Just wait for the executive order to hand over all your cryptos... 
That'll be asset seizure in the crypto era.
985 2018-04-05 21:53:08 I don't see regulation happening but I also don't see them not adding new coins this year. 9 months left in the year. How can they start a venture fund backing crypto companies and support 4 coins on their platform when they are facing real competitors in the space?

987 2018-04-05 21:52:39 This guy would've been better off filing for an extension and just paying up when the markets come back.  The penalties will be way less than the opportunity cost of letting that money roll in the crypto markets.

1003 2018-04-05 21:51:13 @TaxToken  in your FAQ it says that crypto to crypto is a taxable event. This makes no sense, can you provide a citation that backs that statement? I think it should only be relevant for cost-basis calculation  and not taxable unless you convert to USD or purchase something.
1004 2018-04-05 21:50:45 Keep up the great work!

1005 2018-04-05 21:50:44 @360_trader 

Hey brother!!! Now correct me if I'm wrong.. Just watched the CEO of Coinbase day that the coins they don't list all have regulatory concerns.. Does Bitcoin not have probably more regulatory concerns than any crypto?

1024 2018-04-05 21:48:50 Bitcoin is not a scam. Pero yung mga gumagamit ng term na bitcoin para sa compounding ponzi scheme eh yun ang illegal. Kun walang alam sa crypto manahimik na lang.

1025 2018-04-05 21:48:44 You know you've been reading too many #crypto threads when you read that as "Coinbase Block" and wonder wth.
1026 2018-04-05 21:48:40 @coinbase that was your big announcement! Do right by your users that are making you millions which now you are using to open your investment fund and list more crypto currencies like @Ripple

1037 2018-04-05 21:47:50 I really wouldn’t agree.  You making a call on what crypto will do tomorrow is a thumb suck in my opinion.

1047 2018-04-05 21:47:16 Dead to all of us for a while. They will never stay mainstream with BS like this. The point of crypto is to be decentralized. There is too much support for that idea. Centralized companies, tokens, coins, and exchanges can't compete against a worldwide decentralized support.
1048 2018-04-05 21:47:12 Interesting. crypto and regulations around crypto can change very quickly so I'm still optmistic on new coins coming this year but I could totally see the opposite occurring. Only time will tell

1057 2018-04-05 21:45:50 Crypto=Freedom
1058 2018-04-05 21:45:49 The same thing they did with coinbase. They can ask bittrex to share all the data. Not sure how far the reach is on foreign exchanges like binance. We will see. When it comes to collecting taxes govts are exceptionally effective and efficient.
1059 2018-04-05 21:45:46 Ok good otherwise I would have to unfollow 
1060 2018-04-05 21:45:39 Noobs; if you really believed your “Crypto Twitter God” had some inside info regarding the Coinbase rumours then you need to take a long hard look in the mirror 
1061 2018-04-05 21:45:36 Bought when it was 5k last year got out at 17k bought again at 12k got out at 9k.  So far lost 2k of pure profit. Waiting for it to hit below 3k, or lower. hoping for it to go below $100.00. Blockchain technology is great, crypto on the other hand is yet to prove it's usefulness.
1062 2018-04-05 21:45:36 Was that at that crypto house thing?? I heard there were strange goings on there
1063 2018-04-05 21:45:33 Coinbase will be adding $TRX. Oh no wait.. They will be adding $XRP, huh no wait.. What are they going to add then? Aaahh I remember, they will add BITCONEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECT. #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #TRON #Ripple
1064 2018-04-05 21:45:25 "As Bloomberg reported, the top ten largest crypto exchanges rake in $3 million in fees a day."
1065 2018-04-05 21:45:16 At least @SatoshiLite still thinks LTC is LTC and promotes LTC and works on LTC. Roger seems to spend all his time trying to convince people he’s the real BTC when he has a product called Bitcoin Cash. How many other business are claiming they are something else like Roger?

1068 2018-04-05 21:45:03 Oh Dog. True XRP bag holders know that XRP only dumps on news. The good Lord himself could come down from heaven on high and say "My Children, on the 7th day I will make XRP the highest market cap coin" and the price of XRP would drop to lows not seen since November.
1069 2018-04-05 21:44:56 @CNBCFastMoney your charting is absolutely horrible. Fire the person controlling the twitter account and charting for you. They make all of your opinions look like it came from a two year old. 

Sadly, the twitter admin will delete this and nothing will be done.

1070 2018-04-05 21:44:47 After that interview with Coinbase CEO, I know for a fact, crypto is gonna rocket end of the year. Choose your coins/tokens wisely tho. Been a investor since 2016.
1071 2018-04-05 21:44:37 Since when did coinbase become the 'almighty ruler of crypto'.....that announcement was a farce and another chance to spread FUD on all other cryptos.... #pathetic
1072 2018-04-05 21:44:36 Here also that is not banned. Only transacting with businesses settling crypto payments is banned. They already using 3rd party services and not bank. So nothing has changed.
In 3 months time they will figure out better ways to settle payments.

1078 2018-04-05 21:43:25 How much does Garlinghouse pay @CNBC @CNBCFastMoney to shill Ripple during every crypto segment? #xrp #ripple #bitcoin #GarlingMyBalls
1079 2018-04-05 21:43:22 Nope
1080 2018-04-05 21:42:41 yes, about the cartel, there is someone selling off and want the price down. I just see a seller wait for a book without buyer's and start sell, but when a buy wall shows up the seller stop.
1081 2018-04-05 21:42:35 The crypto on ramp for everyone should be getting some bitcoin skin in the game.

1096 2018-04-05 21:41:49 @CNBCFastMoney WTF of announcement of @coinbase ???
Venture fund ???
CNBC you are doing shit announcements of Coinbase
Next time be sure that is another crypto...or refuse to announce something else about @coinbase

1098 2018-04-05 21:41:48 Haha @ verge
1099 2018-04-05 21:41:48 Hoy empiezo a minar PuigdeCoin. Grando crypto! 
1100 2018-04-05 21:41:46 I've got one free spot this arvo. What project in Melbourne should I catch up with? #ausbiz #crypto
1101 2018-04-05 21:41:46 I'm pretty new to this space so I'm also a bit new to the BTC/BCH dispute. I find it hilarious how totally wacko the BCH camp is. We're all a tad weird in crypto, but the BCH crew are all insane super-villains from Austin Powers. CSW, Ver, Jihan, this dude. All 100% mental-cases.
1102 2018-04-05 21:41:35 Take a closer look at  #EXPORT.ONLINE  #ICO. Good product, team, good opportunity to invest.  #EXPORT.ONLINEICO #EXON #Crypto #Blockchain @exportonlineico

1108 2018-04-05 21:41:11 we might lose two more years in this regulatory mess. when we finally wake up the crypto economy will be headquartered in japan, singapore, mauritius, malta, gibraltar and estonia. and it might feel like 1991 all over again.

1114 2018-04-05 21:40:50 I heard speculating with crypto currencies might make you a dime or two. You also could loose everything including your house and everything…

1128 2018-04-05 21:40:08 Another bs from #CNBCFastMoney Venture Fund announcement by Coinbase. You people are gonna get a lot of hate from crypto community.
1129 2018-04-05 21:40:07 Coinbase Ventures Fund  - seed based investments into crypto-companies.  But NOT into cryptos directly or companies with tokens.
1130 2018-04-05 21:40:00 @360_trader Did @coinbase really just say on @CNBCFastMoney that the currency’s they have listed are the only cryptos without regulatory concern? XRP is more regulated than any other crypto out there. That was crazy.
1131 2018-04-05 21:39:59 Команда и все инвесторы, которые сделают эту мечту правдой! Этот проект будет иметь большой успех! Не беспокойтесь это не афера, потому что этот проект так надежно и безопасно. #AKAIITO #ICO #ethereum #blockchain #token #AIC #Cryptocurrency #Tokenization #crypto

1133 2018-04-05 21:39:57 Theyre just going to fund some early start-up companies (not tokens) that they believe will have an impact on the future of crypto. Who cares. Useless hype. Coinbase is shit.
1134 2018-04-05 21:39:54 Love crypto for that
1135 2018-04-05 21:39:49 More regulations in #crypto wouldn’t be so bad if it solved these kind of hypes around announcements.
1136 2018-04-05 21:39:45 It’s like Robert Redford or whoever said: Follow the crypto.
1137 2018-04-05 21:39:45 Hahahaha. Ah man, that’s awesome! Keep up the good Dad work.
1138 2018-04-05 21:39:39 So the fork is not to fix any problems huh?

1140 2018-04-05 21:39:29 This is probably the most irritating part of crypto. So many bs artists out there.
1141 2018-04-05 21:39:11 I don't understand this one either. Why would Coinbase first ERC20 listing be for something that supports direct competitors to GDAX?

1153 2018-04-05 21:38:32 Last I checked there were no "independent validators". They welcome people to run their own validator/node, but there's no incentive to do so.
1154 2018-04-05 21:38:27 No you still do and can invest wherever you want, they are only not allowing banks to directly deal with businesses involved in settling crypto.Exchanges are using 3rd party payment gateways to serve us right now also not bank So nothing has changed #StoptheFUD #IndiaWantsBitcoin

1167 2018-04-05 21:37:43 BCH addition is still up their ass... I guess they have to be extra careful this time... but they are not doing themselves any favor by not expediting this process... Binance is killing it

1178 2018-04-05 21:37:15 And even IF they corroborated there is nothing wrong with incentivizing an exchange to list an asset. How do you think they get listed... magic? Give your head a shake and stop spreading #fud

1182 2018-04-05 21:37:07 Sorry to bust your bubble Justin.
1) I don't get my news from Fox News.
2) When you retweet ANYTHING from disgraceful & propagandist Rick Wilson along with Rachael Maddow, you lost the argument.

1184 2018-04-05 21:36:51 Yet they have $BCH 
1185 2018-04-05 21:36:49 Ripple’s XRP is not a crypto and therefor does not belong on a cryptocurrency exchange. But don’t let logic or reason get in the way of journalism.

1197 2018-04-05 21:36:11 shameless. this guy is literally teaching a 'crypto class' instructing some poor financially uneducated person sitting at home how to pile their hard earned pay-check into Ripple at 2.57, fully knowing it is a mania the public are getting suckered into.
1198 2018-04-05 21:35:50 It's like they didn't learn anything from coinbase-ripple p&d last month

1216 2018-04-05 21:34:20 
1217 2018-04-05 21:34:15 Wow this team are a powerhouse. I love the focus they show and that they actually deliver on what they say.
1218 2018-04-05 21:34:12 Standard practice by a project in the industry. Until Coinbase and Gemini have a clear picture as to what US regulations will be, listing $XRP is a risk to their business model. Checks out.
1219 2018-04-05 21:34:10 @cz_binance please add fiat pairs ASAP. This  “exchange” is the joke holding crypto back in the USA
1220 2018-04-05 21:34:10 BREAKING: COINBASE to launch new venture fund investing in start up crypto projects (not coins). - Per President of Coinbase on CNBC right now!
1221 2018-04-05 21:34:06 Miss me with that Forex and Crypto bullshit. Show me your bank account + how much you’ve invested and profited and then I’ll think about it
1222 2018-04-05 21:33:54 Clearly more “rumour” to Coinbase nonsense!
1223 2018-04-05 21:33:53 Coinbase announcement is their new fund for crypto companies. That's it... Go back to blockfolio folks :)
1224 2018-04-05 21:33:52 Of course. This ain’t crypto homie. Full doxx. Full KYC/AML compliance. Full IRS involvement too.
1225 2018-04-05 21:33:46 Venture fund into crypto COMPANIES
1226 2018-04-05 21:33:39 Do we look like we have money to be dropping on sprinkles? I'm sorry but the sign on the door says coinbase not binance!
1227 2018-04-05 21:33:27 Only withdrawals, unless they decide to allow trading.
1228 2018-04-05 21:33:25 Venture fund for crypto startups at the SEED level
1229 2018-04-05 21:33:21 Crypto downswings??? Try playing poker for a living

This whining and panic in crypto is tiresome
1230 2018-04-05 21:33:15 short term bearish. if they were buying coins, etc, it would literally be like QE for crypto and coinbase would become the big papa FED
1231 2018-04-05 21:33:15 Ahhh drats, you're right! The correct end date is in fact April 30th. Thanks for pointing that out. 
1232 2018-04-05 21:33:14 The Coinbase charts crack me up.  It’s like my grandmother just discovered crypto and that’s the first result she found on Google.
1233 2018-04-05 21:33:13 Justin Sun added as Coinbase spokesperson?
1234 2018-04-05 21:33:07 I won’t! The tournament of Power was great! Like 40 episodes of straight fighting. I’ll be rewatching when the English dubs finally catch up.

1237 2018-04-05 21:32:43 I thought it was great until I saw they were introducing their own crypto currency
1238 2018-04-05 21:32:38 So Coinbase is the base of FUD
1239 2018-04-05 21:32:37 Venture Fund
1240 2018-04-05 21:32:28 Sounds great I wonder if it will be a funfair or actually have a good platform like wild
1241 2018-04-05 21:32:27 And most who run these so called funds have no previous funds experience apart from the $1000 they personally invested and crypto events attendance. With that they call themselves Crypto Investor/Entrepreneur
1242 2018-04-05 21:32:18 @jebus911 @crypto_rand @nondualrandy @TheCryptoDog @CryptoBully
1243 2018-04-05 21:31:56 unless the exchange you have your crypto reports to irs, there is no way they will know about those transactions.
1244 2018-04-05 21:31:52 They are launching a fund to invest in crypto companies and provide seed funding for new projects
1245 2018-04-05 21:31:49 there were 500000 troops and techreps in vietnam at the time, lots of weapons  to change out. took awhile. that was according to a report I read at the time, I think the actual number was 520,000 been awhile lmbo. I handled all secret materials for the squadron and crypto wheels.
1246 2018-04-05 21:31:48 Its crypto...a very volatile market...nobody can guess a target. Just like how people said ripple would never hit $1 but it rose from 0.25 to $3.55 in 2 weeks

1252 2018-04-05 21:31:22 I hope that you will succeed! And pay off crypto currency will be very easy in any store!
1253 2018-04-05 21:31:21 So much FUD holding #Crypto back while great new blockchain tech blossoms. Much of it saves money for businesses in groundbreaking ways. Greed + common sense business choices will eventually drive implementation, then price IMO. I wish crap coins would die off at a faster rate.
1254 2018-04-05 21:31:16 Dude so many crypto guys are reefers. I need a bigger tank now. Lmao

1257 2018-04-05 21:31:05 It's a good summary for the "blockchain 3.0". I tend to agree with everything you just said. If they can pull off that mainnet before the others and it works it'll be interesting how to see the community react to $zil

1264 2018-04-05 21:30:43 Things I don't like about BCH:

Roger said himself he wants miners to have control. Him and his buddies are miners. 

With an unlimited block size how do you avoid another crypto kitty situation, this is such an easy attack vector. 4K video on the BCH blockchain?
1265 2018-04-05 21:30:42 @BMO Very poor arguments for blocking transactions to Crypto... Glad RBC recognizes possibilities still.

1302 2018-04-05 21:27:26 the fact that its drawn out like this does nothing good for coinbase. just makes everyone suspicious again. this insider BS if it IS something big

1320 2018-04-05 21:25:43 I wish it would be $ZRX related just to see the despair of those who fomo'd and then panicked. Crypto has ruined me.
1321 2018-04-05 21:25:41 News just in... @coinbase is moving into the #crypto space and now supports $BTC

1343 2018-04-05 21:23:24 Crypto currencies are open-source projects, so even if the original founder(s) take off, anyone with the right skills can takeover and continue pushing development. So really, investors are relying on the efforts of the community, not a company.

1348 2018-04-05 21:23:12 What kind of crap article is this?

1376 2018-04-05 21:19:59 The upside of crypto prices being so depressed right now is that reddit is finally back to talking about tech and development of technology rather than people moon-cheering.

1408 2018-04-05 21:17:38 No...its a crypto channel.
1409 2018-04-05 21:17:33 L’effervescence autour des crypto-monnaies et de la blockchain est similaire à celle autour d’internet dans les années 2000. Malgré la « bulle internet », la technologie étant révolutionnaire des leaders ont été créés. Qui sera le Google de la blockchain de demain !?

1412 2018-04-05 21:17:06 Is #mm #manipulation still a massive hurdle for new #crypto investors? Manipulation by MM, Exchanges & ICO teams, likes of #cmc, State Actors. This is why crypto should be DE-centralised. Until they’re regulated or decentralised or both. The will alwys be a factor of mistrust
1413 2018-04-05 21:17:03 Still 4.5 million market cap ! Are those coins lost that no one can sale !
1414 2018-04-05 21:17:02 Hocam dogru diyorsunda mesela $2k iken cok pahali gelmisti diye almamistik geldi $20k ya dayandi. Ordan alanlar evet pahaliya aldi ama bu durumda şunu sormak lazim. Kime göre neye göre pahalı . ? 
1415 2018-04-05 21:16:58 I think the most successful crypto projects will be the ones that focus the most on profit. 

I think the most profitable crypto projects will be the ones that strike the perfect balance between performance and cost. 

Though, I think there is merit to what you're saying...

1432 2018-04-05 21:15:14 Crypto is no longer about libertarians. Early investors, miners and devs are fueled by greed and are all about the money. Most newbie investors are also in it just for the money. Sad but true.

1478 2018-04-05 21:11:18 Something doesn't add up - unless the person referred to in the article had other big capital gains the amount he would owe on the Bitcoin trade alone would be about $20K (assume no other losses or gains).
1479 2018-04-05 21:11:13 Yes, banks need some regulative body to be allowed to hold crypto assets. This is missing right now.
1480 2018-04-05 21:11:07 Hate to break it to the doubters, but every crypto trade transaction results in a taxable gain (or a deductible loss) under US tax law.
1481 2018-04-05 21:11:07 If he gained 120k on bitcoin, then lost most of that on altcoins, then his NET capital gain is probably pretty small. Definitely not “life ruining.”

In falling markets protecting USD value is imp. That way You'll get more BTC when it starts to bounce.  

In rising market its visa versa protecting BTC value is imp. That way You'll have max. USD when it starts falling again.

1488 2018-04-05 21:10:37 Ripple can freeze XRP in any wallet that they choose, or freeze the entire circulating supply of it, at any time. They've even already done this in the past when the founder announced that he was going to donate some of his. 100% centralized/controlled.

2028 girls will only remember $crypto address and won't even know whar a visa or master is.

1560 2018-04-05 21:03:36 Bir mal düştükçe normalde para girişi olup mala ilgi artmali. Ama maalesef insanlar öyle değil. Mal yükseldikçe para girişi olup mala ilgi artıyor. Kaybın sebebi o zaten ucuzken değil pahalıya en alıyoruz. Fiyat yükselmeden para girişi olmaz.
1561 2018-04-05 21:03:35 Count me in. I’d be willing to bet I’m in the top 1% of people using @CoinText for crypto evangelism.
1562 2018-04-05 21:03:33 omg is this just about BTC forks?
1563 2018-04-05 21:03:18 #Crypto #Blockchain #Crowdfunding #JoyToken is a market where a reliable, anonymous and completely transparent solution is waiting. All this will be possible thanks to the use of blockchain-technology!!
1564 2018-04-05 21:03:09 Looks like our jackets become the Superbowl Champion Tshirts printed up with the loser that get sent to Africa.
1565 2018-04-05 21:03:01 Dump incoming.
1566 2018-04-05 21:03:01 Adoption to blockchain and Crypto is similar to the adoption of computers for businesses some get it and embrace it while others don't.. the ones who don't are left behind or go belly up and die.  #adaptordie #Blockchain #crypro
1567 2018-04-05 21:02:51 Too edgy for me
1568 2018-04-05 21:02:47 If by shortage you mean not overproducing product to prevent overstock as a repeat of the last crypto boom and inevitable dump that left manufacturers and retailers holding product. I guess.
1569 2018-04-05 21:02:46 And if you could wait for the money that means you are known as a “Baller”!!
1570 2018-04-05 21:02:45 the crypto chop today probably means a big move is coming...my guess is down...but hope it’s up.
1571 2018-04-05 21:02:44 and still more daily volume than most @BittrexExchange coins...
1572 2018-04-05 21:02:40 It's all fair in love and crypto Noru.
1573 2018-04-05 21:02:22 Welcome to crypto.
1574 2018-04-05 21:02:10 Well I am talking end game.  Of course we are in flux right now as they roll out crypto.  Then have a "crypto crisis" that requires regulations and a "single" trustworthy crypto.  Plenty of money to be made in crypto in the meantime I assume, if you're lucky or an insider.
1575 2018-04-05 21:02:10 are you interested in crypto coins ?
take a look and check this coin.
maybe you will like this one coin. check here..

1577 2018-04-05 21:02:05 They are giving free coffee enemas on Fridays and @CryptoNoobGirl just sent in her application to Brian Armstrong.
1578 2018-04-05 21:02:05 Barely a bad drawing.
1579 2018-04-05 21:02:04 The Mini is soooo sweet.
1580 2018-04-05 21:02:01 Where can I short $ZRX hahaha
1581 2018-04-05 21:01:56 did you do the same with your crypto?.. lol..
1582 2018-04-05 21:01:50 Well most people want the money owed to them from the government as quickly as possible. Especially those that want to invest in crypto are not going to take their time filing and waiting to get their money when that money can be working for them. It’s just common sense
1583 2018-04-05 21:01:50 Somebody bought in at ATH 
1584 2018-04-05 21:01:49 I've been getting bundled up & taking a ride here & there but around this time of year it would be nice to bust out the half helmet, and a denim jacket and go for a ride in the country. None of that happening right now!
1585 2018-04-05 21:01:48 I lost 1h sleep waiting for that? Damn.
1586 2018-04-05 21:01:48 how did uou know this?
1587 2018-04-05 21:01:43 Hi, @QuintenFrancois !
I have a question: What happens with crypto market during world financial crisis? Will crypto go up or it follow the global stock market down?
1588 2018-04-05 21:01:36 Here comes the $ZRX dump 82 now
1589 2018-04-05 21:01:29 omg lol wtf is this neg news now?
1590 2018-04-05 21:01:26 FFS.

1596 2018-04-05 21:01:00 Çok iyi şort yakaladılar diyelim. Hiç acimiyorlar. O şortlar patlayincaya kadar yükseltiyorlar. Şu an yine şortlar Ath yapmak üzere. Şimdi yukselttiklerinde o sortlari kapatmayacak şort açanlar. Çünkü herkes nasıl olsa yine düşecek beklentisinde. Bu defa acimazlar.

1600 2018-04-05 21:00:52 Of dogecoin? 
1601 2018-04-05 21:00:51 協力したいという方が出てきてくれました。お互い顔も素性も知らない仲なのにね、、、本当心温まるし、やる気でます。

こういう方がいる限りは、僕も有益な情報をなるべくアウトプットしていきたいなぁ、と自分の気持ちを再確認しました。

俺についてこい、とは言わない。けど、参考にして下さい。
1602 2018-04-05 21:00:46 Savage 
1603 2018-04-05 21:00:43 But last time I tuned in for an interview on cnbc sky channel it wasn’t on , it was a cnbc programme
1604 2018-04-05 21:00:36 Let the dump begin . #zrx #crypto #coinbase
1605 2018-04-05 21:00:35 Yep, just keep telling yourself that:)
1606 2018-04-05 21:00:34 Just WILL it to happen, Rand. If you say it they will come.
1607 2018-04-05 21:00:33 I meant explain further RE government, wall street and hackers taking down crypto. Is this because you read the Cartel article?
1608 2018-04-05 21:00:32 Now that #crypto twitter is bummed out we can get back to the $alts
1609 2018-04-05 21:00:32 So I guess it’s based on the “send” command then?:)
1610 2018-04-05 21:00:27 Also AML regulations will be updated eventually to prevent undocumented money transfers via crypto.
1611 2018-04-05 21:00:23 Spoke to someone today who started investing in crypto back in 2013. He and his friends are 100% in fiat right now. I think we are not at the bottom yet
1612 2018-04-05 21:00:22 ella we love you!!!

1628 2018-04-05 20:59:15 In this space, definitely need to evolve and adapt to stay relevant. OPEN looking unstoppable.
1629 2018-04-05 20:59:13 Don't get me started on XVG... Didn't think I will venture to this delusional side of crypto twitter today...

1631 2018-04-05 20:59:12 Not really in a bear market. Are you doing that? Maybe then you should not invest in crypto  $OCN
1632 2018-04-05 20:58:58 OPEN Platform's ability to reach the entire crypto community looks cool as this covers much higher market share. Plus usage of etherium tokens gives much less comissiona comparing to BTC...
1633 2018-04-05 20:58:56 If you like overvalued vaporware.
1634 2018-04-05 20:58:43 @cryppadotta
Gave this a longer thoght, and realized some of these have happened in past, some are currently happening and some will happen in near future.
And perhaps not directly concerning #BTC but #crypto as a whole
1635 2018-04-05 20:58:40 Hey how do we play this ? How about usdt ? Checkout some crypto to tether ?
1636 2018-04-05 20:58:37 Wazzzz Twitter. Who’s seen Howdoo, an ICO that’s going to start soon. Been thinking of investing in it. The news stories of how FB have screwed up my data is a step too far
1637 2018-04-05 20:58:37 It’s a different show I believe?
1638 2018-04-05 20:58:31 go big or go home

1650 2018-04-05 20:57:27 Yes true . Thanks
1651 2018-04-05 20:57:27 Additionally, extensive purchasing of compute maybe limited on an account, may require business account to get scale required to dent a big 5 crypto network and gaming the account process may result in a band... big risk on cost of attack. Most likely cost prohibitive.

1674 2018-04-05 20:55:06 #1 rule of crypto: Nobody - I don't care if you're Tone Vays or Satoshi Nakamoto - nobody knows if Bitcoin is going up down sideways or in fucking circles. Least of all random guys on twitter.
1675 2018-04-05 20:55:00 Also the idea is to grow the group by showing nothing nefarious is the intention. Just a bunch of zerpers trying to help the xrp cause. One member is working on a doc to explain what its all about.

1680 2018-04-05 20:54:46 yes this would be the notion based of analysing the anarchy communities ways of doing this who don't really believe in their coin, just want a quick buck but i like to think the #xrp community differs... Well ^^ i still support minimal harm principle so no pump dump for me
1681 2018-04-05 20:54:45 Because this short-sighted government does not want good engineers and businesses to stay in India, if they do then they won't be able to fool public anymore. But our struggle will continue to make Crypto and blockchain mainstream in India. #govtbullshit #politicalpropoganda
1682 2018-04-05 20:54:36 Try telling that to the 9938 ICOs in the last 3 months. Lol
1683 2018-04-05 20:54:31 Gecen gun shortlar ath yapmıştı hemen pump geldı. Sizce kaldıraclı sısteme gectiği için mi bu durum da btc ? Belki de hiçbir zaman eskisi gibi olmayacak 3 aşşağı 5 yukarı long patlatacaklar short patlatacaklar olan bıze olacak sanki hocam ?
1684 2018-04-05 20:54:17 Bei Laien / Bekanntenkreis zumindest. „Das ist von den Russen, die haben Crypto eingebaut und Bots! Super weil kost nix!“ (Damals hat WhatsApp noch was nach einem Jahr verlangt)
1685 2018-04-05 20:54:14 PPT populous really might be the next huge wave.  I cant even front on the fact that they are doing ground breaking work in terms of crypto and financial matters involving blockchain.  PPT really might fvck around and be that next thousand dollar coin
1686 2018-04-05 20:54:08 What? He thought the IRS wasn’t going to see how 120k just magically appeared? Anyone with the right mind set knows that’s you have to pay taxes when cashing out plain and simple. There should be a check out in Binance or GDAX to take out taxes like a Casio.
1687 2018-04-05 20:54:05 At first I thought it said „moonshot”...! Too much #crypto hype these days... :D
1688 2018-04-05 20:53:48 This is why crypto needs increased adoption; to get more people advocating for this type of integration. I predict the government's that aren't embracing blockchain will be getting left in the dust from those that are. Eh hem, India right now... smh...
1689 2018-04-05 20:53:46 I'm bagging you, I'm bagging you.

1691 2018-04-05 20:53:42 Late little surge for $ZRX
1692 2018-04-05 20:53:32 Obviously the @coinbase announcement will be bullish one way or another. #bitcoin $crypto #hype
1693 2018-04-05 20:53:21 Hahahaha that is totally a crypto hodler
1694 2018-04-05 20:53:20 This isn’t fast money show though?
1695 2018-04-05 20:53:19 I really dont understand it. How can any one tax you for every singlr trade that you did. Tax jus have to be put on the sum of gains that you made for the entire year. Correct me if im wrong.
1696 2018-04-05 20:53:19 Power corrupts  and there is a lot of money to be made in crypto... I guess any one coin that threatens a system where people are speculative gambling is going to be attacked... CSW is threatening the system

1700 2018-04-05 20:52:37 Should be the other way around 

Everyone should be blocking him also comes with the perks of still being able to reply and respond to tweets that only people you have not blocked can see 
1701 2018-04-05 20:52:30 You can buy a fraction of a Coinbase Coin
1702 2018-04-05 20:52:28 Ofc you can never guarantie this which brings me to the same conclusion as you but unfortunately reality right makes it hard to not adapt any of the methods the others have been using to conquer the crypto fight. I would like to win this race by the minimalharm principle
1703 2018-04-05 20:52:22 I'm more concerned seeing the guy was at Goldman Sachs before founding Coinbase...
1704 2018-04-05 20:52:10 Yeezy gonna be disappointed when pigeon and raven aren’t listed lol
1705 2018-04-05 20:52:06 Yo Bobby! Beers on me. I'd like to discuss a few things with you 
1706 2018-04-05 20:52:05 This will help to spread crypto wider
1707 2018-04-05 20:51:56 #OpenCollectorNetwork are engaged in a very necessary business, it is to facilitate the implementation of the blockade-revolution in the masses and, in particular, in the business environment.

#ICO #crypto
1708 2018-04-05 20:51:52 I am sure we're headed in the right direction. Crypto will bloom. It hasn't even budded yet.
1709 2018-04-05 20:51:35 This is full of shit
1710 2018-04-05 20:51:34 Why don’t we all call crypto for what it truely is. Intangible “Hype” assets.
1711 2018-04-05 20:51:32 Don't know how you could but at the same time CNBC crypto is complete fucking garbage. Every time they say they got big news on something, the news release makes you want to slam your head into a wall repeatedly
1712 2018-04-05 20:51:20 TBH I kind of got out of the prediction game, but I will make an exception. I think that the days of hoping that physical will be properly PRICED AND will be saleable at that price by you or me, are gone. Crypto is going to kill it. IMO because the people are DEMANDING crypto.
1713 2018-04-05 20:51:18 Prediction: IF something is getting listed, at all, today on @coinbase : I would think that a whole host of #ERC20 tokens get listed and not just one. Let's wait and watch! #ETH $Crypto $ZRX
1714 2018-04-05 20:51:07 What r doing Modi gov for cryptocurrency market , Modi want digital India but Modi ban crypto currency hate  Modi gov ,  I was fan of BJP but gov cheat to public , gov do,not want good
1715 2018-04-05 20:51:01 A little chilly for the bike? @BitcoinDood
1716 2018-04-05 20:50:54 Introducing Coinbase coin?
1717 2018-04-05 20:50:50 I'm not sure I am keeping an eye out on Twitter
1718 2018-04-05 20:50:48 Surely not, but I haven't seen anyone else say anything publicly, and I stalk a great deal of people. Just you and I in the club so far, so the jacket order will be cheap.
1719 2018-04-05 20:50:37 There is no one from the left writing for the Atlantic. It’s a platform for genteel centrism, and it’s bizarre that they hired a crypto-fascist lunatic like Williamson in the first place
1720 2018-04-05 20:50:29 I'm the journalist from @crypto_slate who's covering Bitmain. As the network becomes more centralized from industrial miners it also becomes more vulnerable; there is reason for concern.
1721 2018-04-05 20:50:29 @CrryptoKang @Paccoin4Prez @PAC_Poker @Crypt0Creep et al. Are any of you having problems with @discordapp at the minute?
1722 2018-04-05 20:50:19 Keep on hatin while the smart people make profit. Pound sign dumb
1723 2018-04-05 20:50:14 You only keep your crypto on an exchange if your an idiot ... paper wallet ... cold storage ... or get what you deserve.  Just like keeping gold/silver in a bank.

1750 2018-04-05 20:48:22 I agree. I’m staying out of drama and letting others handle that
1751 2018-04-05 20:48:20 It seems like it doesnt because all us crypto folks got caught up in specualtion fever and 100x 24 lambo moon caraousels but there are those that have been working in the shadows and the plumbing is being built!
1752 2018-04-05 20:48:20 read about the XLM vision and what they want to achieve and why Jed McCaleb the founder of Ripple left Ripple. How come that one of the biggest tech companies of this world, hasn't chosen XRP as their solution for programmable money?
1753 2018-04-05 20:48:14 9/ Bottom line, crypto is a new asset that likely doesn't fit existing models as neatly as any coin X proponent likes to think. That doesn't mean BTC won't become the dominant SOV, but it also doesn't mean things are black-and-white.

1763 2018-04-05 20:47:37 whats amazing to me is mixing emotion with effectiveness or "liking" someone. Their logic boils down to "o well at least im not a nigg**." Which boils down to entitlement "how dare you treat me this way because you're beneath me." Embrace it  thats where the joy is their salt.

1787 2018-04-05 20:44:49 If you don't believe or don't get blockchain, I don't have the time to try to convince you. Look at the underlying tech and function of each coin, ask yourself if it could be applied and adopted by an industry.

1814 2018-04-05 20:42:53 It has an absolute amazing community
1815 2018-04-05 20:42:50 I miss those discussions. Crypto twitter isn't the same during a bear season.
1816 2018-04-05 20:42:36 Agreed. The same could have been said for credit cards upon their inception or online payments Robinhood trading for example will make this easier for folks, as will binance if they add USD pairings. All in all I suspect crypto will become a hedge to the stock market, then boom
1817 2018-04-05 20:42:35 Do they also discuss how crypto and the impact of criminal/corporate involvement?
1818 2018-04-05 20:42:26 Well why was it listed on bithump today then? Why does $TRX always have the biggest volume? Because $TRX is the best altcoin !

1820 2018-04-05 20:42:22 7/ Finally, much of the velocity argument centers around MV=PQ. Many don't believe it applies to crypto (and we lack evidence it works today), particularly for crypto that have their own token economics and act as currencies/MOEs, SOVs, and commodities within their networks.

1824 2018-04-05 20:41:45 I agree with you that it is reasonable to oppose organised form of buying or selling but the problem is that we don't live in a vaccum and the reality of things are harsh when compared to what the others are and have been doing. 
I would like to win fair and square
1825 2018-04-05 20:41:45 FWIW comment: coincides with crypto stocks crashing (of course). Anyone can create a "new" crypto currency and make more, but there is a fixed amount of gold & silver in existence. LT bullish $GLD $SLV $GG $PAAS $PVG and a few others

1827 2018-04-05 20:41:24 I think the announcement is going to be a partnership with a major retailer or something like that. @coinbase is positioning themselves to be the stripe/paypal of the crypto -> fiat world
1828 2018-04-05 20:41:22 Actually, @CNBCFastMoney are pretty smart. They use the hate of the crypto people to generate huge reach and engagement. I can only say good job!
1829 2018-04-05 20:41:20 The article may be bunk...but dat pic...wow. Mining farms and crap like that I why I can't see crypto failing any time in the near future. Way too much money involved in the infrastructure.
1830 2018-04-05 20:41:11 I’ve been thinking about that for a while... meanwhile coinbase charges 10€ to 20€ as fee in every crypto, how in hell would list an asset that have a ridiculous (0.02€ +-) purchase fee?

They will lose millions and they won’t allow it, NEVER!

1838 2018-04-05 20:40:24 Africa is a challenge but the people are hungry to learn and looking to improve their lives as they know their governments never can. first we educate, teach others how to have their own business getting btc into the hands of their neighbors and watch as they teach us the rest!
1839 2018-04-05 20:40:19 If I understood correctly, that's not only BTC blockchain flaw, I think all suffer from the same issue. Unfortunately.

1841 2018-04-05 20:40:06 This is the truest statement I've read since joining the crypto game in early '18. I've gained a lot of knowledge and made good and bad trades. One thing I haven't done is make a trade based on anyone's input from twitter. Noobs, read and follow this message, and stay safe.

If you can't SAVE CRYPTO, then Shame on India! 
RBI takes this golden opportunity as a lead but it's not the right way. Just think about Indian Investors in Crypto, What about us? Now, 100% of credit and advantage only goes to RBI.

1887 2018-04-05 20:36:17 Centralized as in Ripple controls it entirely, they can block wallets, reverse transactions, etc. You cannot do that with decentralized technologies. This makes it the same as the current system, and the whole point of this all is to free us all from that system of control.
1888 2018-04-05 20:36:14 This continues to frustrate me within the crypto sphere

1895 2018-04-05 20:35:29 I doubt that Coinbase will list any token today or even make an announcement about a specific token listing. Probably something like a roadmap for the ERC20 integration or something like that. Just my opinion #crypto #zrx #Coinbase .

1902 2018-04-05 20:35:01 Bitcoin is down because people keep falling for other tokens claiming to be the next best instead of keeping their money in the front line. Its like an army of 500 trying to occupy 13 different countries at once.

I hold a relatively small position compared to other coins in my #crypto portfolio, but in my opinion this will be a huge opportunity buy.
1904 2018-04-05 20:34:57 I’m not sure about this. I feel like @coinbase would require a ya know a working product and $trx still hasn’t released their main net. Be wary of this rumor.
1905 2018-04-05 20:34:49 I am a fan of crypto... just not in its current config...
1906 2018-04-05 20:34:49 What if #coinbase is just like an ex, wanting to say hi. They know you’re spending a lotta time with #binance and want to see if it’s serious...

1928 2018-04-05 20:33:04 He’s a selfish negligent person who thought bitcoin was plenty solid when he was profiting off of it. I’m grateful for his contribution to the first major exchange, but otherwise couldn’t care less about his opinion on anything other than how his jail food will taste.

1930 2018-04-05 20:32:53 We don’t pay taxes on crypto. What crypto? Any decent cryptocurrency is decentralized so a by product is ending the Federal Reserve. Just like the rich no taxes.
1931 2018-04-05 20:32:48 Check the crypto because I based it off another person's code. ;)
1932 2018-04-05 20:32:47 That's what I was implying, I'm fed up of the uneducated opinions of the uneducated. I hold XRP and some other alt coins but I can't understand the mentality of my coin is better than your coin...I wonder if the school they are attending was funded by Ripple lol.

1966 2018-04-05 20:29:44 I think I might have said this already,  but I am a firm believer if you are not holding some type of crypto currency right now whether it be $20 amount, $50, or $100, you are doing it wrong. It’s ideal to catch a trend before it becomes a trend.
1967 2018-04-05 20:29:41 I like physical silver. The very fact it is hammered down over and over is quite telling. However, I don't think the game is about to end.  I think it will go on and on. AND once they put in the crypto currency that 'must' be used. It is game over for everyone but insiders.

2030 2018-04-05 20:23:31 @RBI is an institution whose time has come. I think INR might go the hyperinflationary route and people will have no option but to cash out from their bank accounts to buy crypto, causing bank runs and thus bringing the entire system down.
2031 2018-04-05 20:23:30 Nah, but I do know a little about speculation...
2032 2018-04-05 20:23:21 So...about these crypto investments lol
2033 2018-04-05 20:23:21  @Elhousni10  frère 
2034 2018-04-05 20:23:17 So I’ve been yelling a lot about Bitcoin Cash  and CSW the past few days. I don’t want to give the impression that I’m letting anyone else off the hook.

All crypto has serious problems, but some are worse than others.
2035 2018-04-05 20:23:16 Regarding @coinbase announcement: I think they will announce an acquisition. 
However recent price action looks to me like insiders are buying up on $ZRX. Could it be the first ERC20 token listed on Coinbase?
2036 2018-04-05 20:23:12 Agree! When realising you cannot burn the old system down & replacing it without blood being shed it bc is unjustifiable from a spiritual or moral standpoint. XRP still has features that would end money printing + allow for more power to the people etc without anarchy.
2037 2018-04-05 20:23:11 Hope you right David, unfortunately I've joined in the end of December which wasn't a perfect start point but it's enough to see that you're right quite often. TRX holding & hopeing

2053 2018-04-05 20:21:46 I think banks will have to compete in other ways. Adapt or die type scenario, but I highly doubt they go away completely. They will probably adopt a new business model(s) along the way to best serve their customers. The masses dont know anything about this stuff. Hand-holding?
2054 2018-04-05 20:21:46 How? Do you think zrx will be listed too?
2055 2018-04-05 20:21:45 Not everything negative is FUD. Not everything positive is a bull run. Keep your heads screwed on and follow healthy strategies $Crypto.

2064 2018-04-05 20:21:02 What i thought was it bc was a buy xrp with friends on a special ripple day kind of thing for already hodlers and long term ripple investors. 
It was stemmed from the notion of 99% of the other communities have been doing this for a long long time already. I do not condone Pump
2065 2018-04-05 20:21:02 rigth. and this is why we are xrp investors. 
2066 2018-04-05 20:20:57 Yes they do - sad as it is...Nothing in crypto solved any of that, nothing in crypto made that anything worse. You know.
2067 2018-04-05 20:20:57 Will my new crypto call get listed on Coinbase
2068 2018-04-05 20:20:54 Why the fuck not
2069 2018-04-05 20:20:47 This crypto market is kicking my fuckin ass!  #Bitcoin
2070 2018-04-05 20:20:45 I highly doubt they care, but the constant bickering has to be taking a negative toll on crypto as a whole from outsiders who are only dipping their toes.
2071 2018-04-05 20:20:37 Every single asset across the crypto market is performing poorly. Ex: Ethereum is down from $1200 to near $400. Lack of liquidity is the issue, the price has been heavily manipulated downwards because of selling pressure.

2081 2018-04-05 20:20:06 A lot of xrp investors care nothing about decentralization or the crypto market. Most of them are the exact opposite of the essence of crypto.
2082 2018-04-05 20:19:29 But do you have any Tron Dogs?

2098 2018-04-05 20:18:10 The groups intentions was to do a coordinated buying xrp with friends event on a date that was special for ripple for example. It was a xrparmy thing but the "pump" mentality, title, if that is what the group chooses to go forward with i will not support it any further ofc.
2099 2018-04-05 20:18:06 I think $OMG is most likely out of that list. I agree that the chances are slim to none regarding Tron. I'm not sure I agree to label any entity as not that stupid. We are shown over and over that statement just isn't true.

2119 2018-04-05 20:15:25 The coinbase #fomo is getting crazy, be careful not to get stuck with a huge bag of the coin they didn’t list. My prediction is they announce their index coin #crypto
2120 2018-04-05 20:15:24 Maybe they're going to announce they'll be moving to Malta, for the popularity boost.
2121 2018-04-05 20:15:22 Just being on reddit > cryptocurrency will show you how hard it is to fight them fudsters and xrp haters who just want to get rich even if the world must burn in the progress.. XRP never get mentioned or featured etc..

2126 2018-04-05 20:14:58 Your bitcoins are gone
2127 2018-04-05 20:14:56 Jim Rickards is not objective when it comes to crypto I am not sure why he uses false statements and hates bitcoin cuz criminals use it then hates bitcoin because criminals are moving away from bitcoin.  Really?
2128 2018-04-05 20:14:53 And every single one of those companies probably have a vested interest in Bitcoin and decentralization failing.
2129 2018-04-05 20:14:48 So when they say "high" DSS do you think they are talking 7-digit DSS or 8-digit DSS? Or higher?
2130 2018-04-05 20:14:45 その昔私がドイツに出張した際、"Damen"と書かれているドアを間違えて開けてしまい、中の色がピンクっぽくて、即座に間違えたことに気付きました。

日本では、男性用は青、女性用は赤、と区別されていますが、色での識別が性別の判断に影響を与えていることは、ある意味便利です。

2133 2018-04-05 20:14:40 Trolls be sittin on the sidelines,
their comments are intended to
crush you, gives 'em a good vibe,
their ego goes up if they see you feel maligned, but they're behind the times, in crypto twitter only positivity is welcome, act up and you'll be expelled, like shit from a rectum.

2138 2018-04-05 20:13:58 Today in India RBI also stopped banks to deal with Crypto and i think its in favor of consumers itself as Cryptos are not controlled by any govt body.
2139 2018-04-05 20:13:52 They would lose all integrity to list either one of those coins for the hope of cashing in. They’re not that stupid. $ZRX $OMG $BAT most likely candidates.

2144 2018-04-05 20:13:15 People should distance themselves from this project - it makes crypto projects look inefficient.  Why would they need 100x the startup funds of a non crypto project?
2145 2018-04-05 20:13:10 Thank you Dr. T <3
For our sake i honestly hope regulations happen asap bc xrp won't survive an 100% anarchy crypto world unfortunately 
The anarchists are not playing fair game... And you know it!

2147 2018-04-05 20:13:02 Stick with fundamentally solid projects through this bear market. We're going sideways. This is your opportunity to redefine what you have considered "normal" for your entire life. Do not miss out. Accumulate, consolidate, invest, and look several years down the road.

2148 2018-04-05 20:12:58 But wholeheartedly believes in "Magic: The Gathering Coin"
2149 2018-04-05 20:12:56 it is easy. Ripple will do it in long term. 
others will keep in the background. every day other anarchistic coins will be created, with pump and dump games. 
but ripple and xrp,... they will see real usecases, real economic, real value, real price in the future.
2150 2018-04-05 20:12:55 When is the supposed @coinbase announcement?
2151 2018-04-05 20:12:54 All of the money, partnerships and real world solutions they solve yet barely anyone uses it. Why?
2152 2018-04-05 20:12:52 Thanks guys, there are crypto pegged metals such as on @UpholdInc that a few people add to their portfolio, so would be handy to be able to reflect the values in blockfolio
2153 2018-04-05 20:12:40 I actually agree, and I'm invested in many others as well. Many will fail, many will succeed, a few will be astonishing. I think xrp will succeed, they have a lot of money... 
2154 2018-04-05 20:12:40 consider the source. dude got caught embezzling red handed, and now says he’ s going to forego billions. sure buddy.
2155 2018-04-05 20:12:38 Great tune! You fought back the tears and powered on, like a good crypto does! Love it
2156 2018-04-05 20:12:31 Drop out buy a bigger bag and retire 2020 and beyond 
2157 2018-04-05 20:12:30 Ok. You sound mad and seem to be having a tough day. Hope things around for you though.   You are now blocked and have only yourself to blame. 6 month probation
2158 2018-04-05 20:12:27 OMG! That’s way tooooooo funny
2159 2018-04-05 20:12:09 Vinny in case (which I doubt) nobody gives you enough credit - I will personally fly from Europe and we (I) make a Hall of Crypto Fame in @multicoincap's office, if Kyle allows us(me) to ;-). If not we still have amazon or FB office to do so ;-)
2160 2018-04-05 20:12:05 One day we might look back on 2018 as the year when TRON took 2nd place in marketcap, earned it because it is actually useful now, and will be revolutionary. We were not satisfied just having another currency, a bank or any crypto can do that.

2176 2018-04-05 20:10:10 Investing into the crypto market is a smart idea, and if you do it correctly, you'll make a lot of money, real quickly.

2194 2018-04-05 20:08:37 this is why regulations are important, and will come also to the crypto world...
2195 2018-04-05 20:08:36 2/ This will be painful for the next 6-12 months (maybe less), but is creating a great foundation for the market to grow 100x. Some top crypto funds already getting cleared. Security tokens FTW.
2196 2018-04-05 20:08:27 ええ、そんなありがたいお言葉を・・心強いです。

僕としては、先日ツイートしたトレンド転換系の指標、GMMAを筆頭にその他のいくつかがどれだけトレンド判定に有効そうか、誰か検証してくれないかなぁと思っていました。
2197 2018-04-05 20:08:25 You can thank #Crypto #Bitcoin #Litecoin and even #Ripple for changing the world. #Blockchain
2198 2018-04-05 20:08:18 Agreed. We’ve seen the same in China and S. Korea and similar threats in the US. Remember that time India banned gold transactions and high value paper currency notes? Now crypto? Wonder what they plan on trading with...

2202 2018-04-05 20:08:01 So true, this next bull run I'm planning on securing profits/having fiat on the sideline at all times. These alt prices are too juicy to miss out on
2203 2018-04-05 20:07:58 BCH is not Roger's. He supports it, and terrorists support Bitcoin and crypto, but does that detract from their purpose and value?  No.

2211 2018-04-05 20:07:23 Check all major names in crypto. They are flooded with bots similar. This epidemic is well understood within crypto twitter. There is no end to the made up reasons to hate us or think we are a scam. Save yourself the effort and just find another project that you believe in.Cheers
2212 2018-04-05 20:07:22 i don't like the idea of 99% of anarchy cryptos getting bc a free win when it comes to community buying.. They are doing these kind of stuff in masses and often.
Yes XRP i opposite to anarchy but we are not supposed to just not play the market in any shape or form b4 regulations?

2221 2018-04-05 20:06:25 Well, that's true. I agree. But I don't think that one group of 50 will be able to create such a demand that it will make the price move long term. Anyway, I HODL such a small amount that it won't help with anything. The true demand should happen naturally - from partnerships.

2237 2018-04-05 20:05:27 Try to understand where it came from. It was ripple followers and hodlers who started the idea but all in the group clearly stated no pump etc and wanted a completely different approach to both name, purpose and description of group
2238 2018-04-05 20:05:24 Yanlış anlamayın sadece soru olarak yönelttim size?
2239 2018-04-05 20:05:21 Agree. I feel like we are watching future YT starts be born. They are doing well in a bear market, imagine how they will do when the media and common folk are interested by crypto again
2240 2018-04-05 20:05:21 Automakers use connections to kill next gen cars, fossil fuel producers use connections to kill alternative energy, banks trying to kill crypto currency, you keep using this term Free Market, I do not think it means what you think it means.
2241 2018-04-05 20:05:19 i understand what you mean. but you forget one important point:
whales do also have groups... whales * x  vs.  fishes *y
2242 2018-04-05 20:05:06 I think it is possible because of trading volume and potential profits. Not probable but Coinbase is a for profit company and Tron will make them the most money. I'm pulling for ZRX but I don't think so.
2243 2018-04-05 20:05:01 Do a video about a good portfolio,  investments without crypto. i am talking about stocks, bonds, real state... i am a poker player from europe that never heard about this before.

2267 2018-04-05 20:03:19 Hence $ZRX pump...Coinbase to become a Dex looking like most likely announcement

2269 2018-04-05 20:03:08 found a ripple exchange based on the ripple ledger.
develope software where you can use xrp, or fund people able to do that.
create real life business using xrp. 
that are also good options, how to make xrp more healthy
2270 2018-04-05 20:03:07 Yeah, but what about Joey? Everybody always ignores what Joey wants
2271 2018-04-05 20:03:05 is this a crypto related tweet?
2272 2018-04-05 20:03:01 Not to mention everyone is saying they could be pulling the biggest exit scam crypto has ever seen.. i hope thats not true for the space sake.
2273 2018-04-05 20:02:57 OMG THANKS BRAD-CHAN 
2274 2018-04-05 20:02:54 I Partially agree.. The whole cryptospehre is a nightmare... Tons of Pump & Dump and coordinated stuff.. Not easy for the only coin out there imo being XRP to battle against all those anarchists so a coordinated event for those interested already in buying would not seem (1/2)
2275 2018-04-05 20:02:44 Its bringing the power of mass buying to the individual which is normally only available to the whales

2279 2018-04-05 20:02:33 I agree with you. Little chance they list it even though I would love that. Honestly, could see them listing Tron $TRX for the profits they will make. IMHO... thoughts?

2288 2018-04-05 20:02:12 HODLing is doing nothing to help with driving demand and increasing prices. We are relying on others to introduce new liquidity. As they turn to HODLing you end up with a further stagnating or falling price. Pump and dump isn’t the answer but to thrive the market needs liquidity.

2341 2018-04-05 19:58:59 Crypto culture is literally the cringiest shit. It's just the next offshoot of the same reddit gaming culture that gave us professional counterstrike and threatened to murder Anita Sarkeesian for having opinions. It operates on that same "it's ok to be a dick" mentality.

2410 2018-04-05 19:53:30 Even if they list ZRX, fundamentally what difference does that really make? There are a decrease in buyers for everything atm.
2411 2018-04-05 19:53:27 All the magical crypto friends look very unhealthy. Their gums are receding, they clearly don't brush and floss.

2413 2018-04-05 19:53:26 Splitting up shares to a private key sounds like a recipe for disaster in regards to personal assets. The crypto movement is meant to put power back into your hands, not into the hands of 4 other people. Would never recommend 3rd parties to have access to private keys.

2420 2018-04-05 19:52:54 Ça serait vraiment un grand pas vers la décentralisation car bat et brave sont des produits déjà utilisable.

2425 2018-04-05 19:52:42 Wondering -once this realisation happens enmasse -if this causes any downward pressure on Crypto prices?
Asking for a friend...
2426 2018-04-05 19:52:40 @aelfblockchain You guys also went to deconomy? Glad to see so many good projects went.
2427 2018-04-05 19:52:37 Haha..they got burned and caught high and want out
2428 2018-04-05 19:52:31 .@evan_van_ness how are you liking @substack after switching from @MailChimp? We also likely need to move off Mailchimp due to their anti-crypto stance.
2429 2018-04-05 19:52:27 i think thats way more likely tbh

2431 2018-04-05 19:52:13 It’s a long journey if you’re prepared to take it. Also a lot of people think crypto is dead but that’s your decision to make. I might be moving on to forex by the end of the year we’ll see

2433 2018-04-05 19:52:01 The fact is Ripple hand picked corporations as the trusted. Those trusted then choose who communicates with the network. XRP also relies heavily on the success of Ripple. These two reasons are why XRP is shunned in a decentralized environment.
2434 2018-04-05 19:52:00 That's not true. Very few places but it's starting to pop up. Read an article other day dude used LTC and CANN for his purchase in New Mexico or Cali it was. Thing is, they have enough time with banking, add in Crypto, hard to pay bills with that, yet...
2435 2018-04-05 19:51:59 basecly yes. You can see an unhealthy market when the sell/buy orders are too far splitted. but they are close! and the depth is also here.
2436 2018-04-05 19:51:58 We sell it off then :) But there is definitely a good likelihood of this announcement.
2437 2018-04-05 19:51:56 They got me!! Arghgg
2438 2018-04-05 19:51:49 Same here. Feels like I have the portfolio divided as I wanted. Unfortunately also the lack of fiat on the sidelines :(

2440 2018-04-05 19:51:47 My thoughts for a while now
2441 2018-04-05 19:51:43 You are clearly doing a nice job building the crypto side of the biz.  I can sense the momentum building.  Juice the revenue side with enertec, ramp up the other operations, and shares will go up smartly.  It is all in the execution.  Credibility.  I feel it coming!!

2447 2018-04-05 19:51:02 I can’t wait to hear the breaking news that TRX pumped yesterday.
2448 2018-04-05 19:51:00 @PMOIndia @narendramodi @arunjaitley Dear sir, do not understand how can rbi decide what people should do with their own hard earned money. If frauds using Fiat and gold cannot be prevented then how rbi is so sure of crypto is used in money laundering and frauds?
2449 2018-04-05 19:50:58 say my regular income is 40k but I have 50k in ST crypto cap gains, are those capital gains taxed in the 90k tax bracket (40+50) or are they taxed in the 40k tax bracket? @CryptoTaxGirl
2450 2018-04-05 19:50:55 I doubt they announce any listing of coins today. Rather, they will announce the new businesses they have been working on
2451 2018-04-05 19:50:45 As far as currency regulation, not that I’m aware of. SEC do work closely with CFTC and there are crypto advocacy groups like @coincenter and @TheBKP_Official that they may interact with.
2452 2018-04-05 19:50:35 1. We released the MVP / 2. We launched the first version of android App / 3. We are able to get the position in top 5 trending ICOs / 4. We achieved the top rating 4.9/5 by ICO bench / 5. We crossed the 5k registered users @RootBlockchain #crypto
2453 2018-04-05 19:50:33 Said the same thing earlier, would be dope.
2454 2018-04-05 19:50:26 I expect them to add $TRX since the volume would make them billions of dollars.

2460 2018-04-05 19:49:41 What if Coinbase doesn't list $ZRX but they implement their protocol for decentralized exchanges following the steps announced by Binance few days ago.
2461 2018-04-05 19:49:40 $Lux is solid.. They met most and were effected against an attack on the chain which didn't affect any users

2471 2018-04-05 19:48:52 To be honest, HODLing has a negative impact on price. Think about it. If you’re not selling, you’re not liquid to buy anything else. This has a flow on effect. It’s like putting your money on term investment, the more that do that the less liquidity there is in the market.

2483 2018-04-05 19:47:52 if the marketcap of xrp is 20000000000 and the price goes down 2%
you have to pay 3%+ to work against neg. trend. 
 =600000000 / 50 members = 12,000,000 for every member to pay  to "hold the price". Even if you have 1000 members it would be far to expensive.
No good plan. Sorry

2508 2018-04-05 19:45:34 I have a dream:

One day, it will be the crypto businesses and exchanges that will have the power to ban banks/countries/governments from dealing with us, instead of the other way round.

We won't ban them though cause we're not idiots and we want fair commerce to succeed
2509 2018-04-05 19:45:34 That's how @Barclays makes me feel when dealing with their customer services.

2539 2018-04-05 19:43:31 will it cross the 6.9k ?
it may
2540 2018-04-05 19:43:19 I put the amount just to give a figure. It's the concept behind that can lead to something bad, especially in terms of reputation. Thinking of how to help XRP growing is good, sometimes some ideas have to be discharged tho. Nothing personal of course!
2541 2018-04-05 19:43:14 @arunjaitley  I support crypto because it is the voice of youth. It is a revolution and should be legalized.

2585 2018-04-05 19:38:53 Agreed, few people in the non-crypto space would agree that we don’t need banks. As volatile as crypto has been the last year, I’m not even ready to say that.

Therefore, it’s concerning when crypto companies attempt to disrupt content industries and they don’t even realize they’re in the content business.

2606 2018-04-05 19:37:30 Besides being something that goes against principles of transparent trading, the problem is that the good intentions of many can then be manipulated by few "less honest" players.

2706 2018-04-05 19:27:51 its like this shame:

me the bad boy (bad boy for life) set sell orders xrp for 0.54
Now i organise as many people as possible to creat a little pump to minimum 0.54+ 
After this little pump the market will correct down again.
After the price is down to 0.49 again i buy mor xrp

2747 2018-04-05 19:23:53 Re-reading the post, I don't think he goes far enough in making the point.

2795 2018-04-05 19:18:36 It's sad to see normal working people getting into alts because they think bitcoin is too expensive. They're stuck on quantity not quality. Eventually merchant adoption of bitcoin will drive the price to millions. No other crypto is ready except bitcoin. Open your eyes.

1. Bitcoin
2. Ethereum
3. Litecoin
4. Ripple
5. Monero
6. IOTA
7. NEO
8. Cardano
9. EOS
10. Nano

Those are the ones I looked up. Following Metcalfe's law that should be an appropriate ranking...assuming only Reddit matters

2818 2018-04-05 19:17:09 Wgat does this mean? Is it like we won't be able to withdraw our money from crypto exchanges to our bank account because banks are regulated by RBI.?

2824 2018-04-05 19:16:07 Having a lot of respect for your work. I understand you have nothing against BCH and have issues with CSW. Offering a simple counter argument would’ve been more conducive. We need more discussion and less ‘personality’ drama in the crypto space.
2825 2018-04-05 19:16:04 Passive income is great, entries are very relevant though. For most PoS-only coins you want to accumulate a massive amount of the supply early to ROI fast. Only then it's an easy game, not before.

2829 2018-04-05 19:15:24 Wrong. Crypto Twitter is a school yard popularity contest.
2830 2018-04-05 19:15:20 Instead of labeling someone asking questions as a FUDster, maybe looking at it as an opportunity to be helpful is the better route?

This is why crypto is having a hard time with adoption. Everyone is against everyone but we’re fighting on the same side..

If you don’t understand the importance of mining as far as security and deflationary monetary policy then I think you might need to go retake crypto 101.

3107 2018-04-05 18:52:48 India has not banned the crypto, but coward decision taken by @RBI today is no less than ban on crypto. #isupportcrypto

3109 2018-04-05 18:52:40 The Price of $XRP will catch up to the value without manipulation of groups like this.  This isn't a good idea, also goes against the values of most community members.
3110 2018-04-05 18:52:34 @arunjaitley i support crypto, we want legal
3111 2018-04-05 18:52:30 Most #crypto noobs don’t know, but once you have a 50% loss you need a 100% gain to break even again.
3112 2018-04-05 18:52:25 Many in this space have much to lose if @Ripple succeeds as planned.

It is not a zero-sum game, but in reality, the first one to grab institutional/corporate use will gain a dominate position in #crypto.

$XRP is a threat to their investments. Why else bother trashing it?

#Fear
3113 2018-04-05 18:52:21 RT APompliano: What you have to accept to believe in crypto:

1. The current system can be improved
2. Democratizing power is important
3. Technology is usually a net good
4. We live in a global world
5. Change isn't easy (via EazlTweets)

3122 2018-04-05 18:51:36 @XRPTrump what should i do if india bans crypto ( RBI just announced that banks cant do any trasaction with exchanges in india ) i have xrps on ledger though

#socialwallet
3130 2018-04-05 18:50:13 Not sure why crypto trades have this "HODL" mindset. With cryptos being the most volitile wouldn't you want to limit your time exposure to these situations?
3131 2018-04-05 18:50:02 like something wouldn't be up 30%+ from insider trading if that was the case... lol. I'm with you, probably more catering to institutional customers which is bullish for crypto and meh for my bags.

3140 2018-04-05 18:49:13 They didnt banned it... they cannot ban it, they just stopped banks to deal with exchanges. No 1 can kill P2P and crypto. Indian govt step is very sad however.

3165 2018-04-05 18:47:35 The only thing that's appealing & also detrimental about crypto is the constant volatility.
3166 2018-04-05 18:47:35 The problem with having only gold and silver is that there is no competition in currency. For central banks and planners it is great. Crypto folks are fighting central control. At least those that may not be speculators. Critical mass happens at the next stock market crash

3171 2018-04-05 18:47:12 I don't believe this upcoming announcement is about any new listings. Connecting the dots makes me think they are likely unveiling a new investment option for institutional money to get into crypto (custodial services?)

Mega bullish on crypto if this ends up being the case.
3172 2018-04-05 18:47:03 #RBICantStopMe My view is that Govt should focus on giving a proper regulation instead of completely banning. Plus we need to concentrate more on scammers, not on cryptos. Look at the bigger picture, banning this will introduce illegal crypto trading
3173 2018-04-05 18:47:03 @TuurDemeester I bought crypto yesterday, I thought it was on sell. After only one day it all looks like crap.

3187 2018-04-05 18:46:07 Love watching "crypto experts" tell the media that "Bitcoin is coming back at a higher price than ever by the end of the year" w/o disclosing the obvious fact that they themselves own BTC and therefore need to hype it up to small-time investors so they can unload w/o losing $$
3188 2018-04-05 18:46:04 Yes rbi has asked banks to not deal with crypto exchanges .... BTC wHich used to trade at premium in india is now trading at 1600$ less then international exchanges . Everyone in india is selling
3189 2018-04-05 18:45:53 coinbase commerce looks like they are really coming after bitpay. would be hilarious if they announced a crypto-backed debit card today.

3191 2018-04-05 18:45:44 C'mon children we all know that each exchange has different prices. It his 689 on binance but significantly higher on the Korean exchanges which is typical. Y'all are ridiculous. Go make some $$$

3207 2018-04-05 18:44:24 True if one's investment time horizon is short and one's only framework for evaluating it as SoV is market randomness. Both liabilities for crypto investors.

3233 2018-04-05 18:42:16 Yeah in my experience econ / finance experts are more closed minded - partly bc they tend to be too intimidated to even start in on CS / crypto.
CS / crypto experts just tend to assume they can grok the nuances of the financial system / econ without having to crack a book though.
3234 2018-04-05 18:42:11 I don't think Coinbase are going to add a new coin today btw
3235 2018-04-05 18:42:09 Everyone will flock to crypto as a hedge against a crisis.
3236 2018-04-05 18:42:07 While that is a funny concept to ponder the prefix cypto means: a person having a secret allegiance to a political creed. So a crypto fascist would be someone who is secretly fascist however, this does not actually preclude him from also being some sort of block-chain fascist.
3237 2018-04-05 18:42:03 I love the crypto industry where a company’s CFO can speak at a conference wearing  shorts, sneakers and a hoodie and this is the norm :).
3238 2018-04-05 18:41:49 The problem is that people are in desperate need of fiat. When one have made”enough” profits, they sell, they don’t actually USE the crypto for its intended purpose. Crypto adoption still has a ways to go to liberate us ALL.  Hopefully people will understand it’s use soon.

3241 2018-04-05 18:41:23 RBI has shot themselves in the foot! Killed innovation completely. Killed a lot of crypto startups in India! sad all will go to Europe now!
3242 2018-04-05 18:41:18 This portfolio is not too large. Especially in crypto. Nice picks
3243 2018-04-05 18:40:52 This is a good project, London Football Exchange (LFE) #LFEmarket #crypto #blockchain
3244 2018-04-05 18:40:46 It's not a dick move. It's a smart one, actually, and will only benefit crypto in the long run. RBI is probably planning to demonetise a fraction of the circulating currency to convert it into crypto.
3245 2018-04-05 18:40:45 I support crypto

3248 2018-04-05 18:40:34 Governments and central banks are making fake promises that they are "protecting" investors by disallowing banks to facilitate crypto transactions, but in reality they are protecting their own interests so that banks dont go out of business.

3267 2018-04-05 18:38:16 I'm not sure. I agree, seeing as a credit card transaction is a micro loan, the person financing the loan should have a right to determine what is acceptable for those micro loans are for. If its your cash, then they have no right to tell you what you can spend it on.

3298 2018-04-05 18:35:42 Agreed, but we also need to make it easier to use crypto. It’s confusing for new customers and that’s a problem that needs to be addressed if we want growth and adoption - imo.

Good job government, instead of indicate us how to fucking fill taxes on crypto you just go and criminalize us.
3405 2018-04-05 18:26:03 crypto makes sense only if it is backed. so yes there is sovereign backing here but ideally instead of a credit rating, crypto should be tethered to an actively traded commodity, and even here we need to steer clear of politically sensitive ones so rbi coin is a fail, sorry

3511 2018-04-05 18:15:57 You guys should add a crypto asset as an investment.
3512 2018-04-05 18:15:44 Because you're intellectually a child?   This is a very serious scaling debate.   Its a technical issue.   The social change that Bitcoin was supposed to bring is a very serious issue as well.  Crypto is full of children like you and that needs to change.
3513 2018-04-05 18:15:39 Mais du coup, crypto-actifs le donne à penser qu'il y aurait d'autre crypto que des monnaies....?
3514 2018-04-05 18:15:22 Crypto currencies are deflationary when they have fixed supply. That’s why 1 BTC can be fractured into Satoshis. As BTC value rises, the Satoshis gain purchasing power. The US dollar is the opposite that. What part do you not get?

3655 2018-04-05 18:05:07 This is bad.  Probably the most damaging thing that can happen to crypto at this stage is closing the on and off ramps to fiat.

3659 2018-04-05 18:04:52 Rules for Trading Crypto: 

1) Don’t FOMO

2) If you wouldn’t hold BTC at this time, don’t buy ANY ALT  

3) After entering a trade, leave time to develop & stop loss enough below entry that exit isn’t premature

So no need to pay taxes on profits booked ? 
Or RBI waited for 31st March just for fun.

3691 2018-04-05 18:02:08 Are there any @decentraland VR demos available?
I'd love to see what's actually being built & talk to some makers.
There were good crypto proof of concepts for a model for selling virtual real estate, but the actual VR SDK & implementation seemed lacking.
I need to see a VR demo

Crypto should be legal in India. Max countries are supporting and moving forward. India should also regulate it.
Banning is unfair as some has already got profit such as big investors, in India also and we, THE BEGINNERS...

3727 2018-04-05 17:59:13 Having spent a couple of months investing in Crypto, here's my step by step advice for others thinking of doing so:

2) Eat it
3) That's it, eat it all up now
4) Climb in a bin
5) Cry

If you do not legalise crypto trading, then you have no right to say "Digital India".

Please legalise cryptocurrencies

The reasons for banning crypto by gvt will not solve the reasons for banning the same

Cryptocurrncy is the only way to stop curruption.
But the politicians want curruption.
I really don't understand what is the loss or what is the danger.
If cryptocurrncy is really a danger
So why the USA WORLD POWER IS USING THE CRYPTO.
4075 2018-04-05 17:28:22 Part of NVDA over valuation is tied directly with Crypto. Let's not forget NVDA was $19 buck stock a few years ago. While they won't go back there anytime soon(I hope), it is not a surprise to see NVDA rip through $200. Someone loaded up bought 150 puts Jun FYI.

4081 2018-04-05 17:27:46 #btc 2020de 250000$ olunca elinde 2BTC olan hayatı garantilemiş olur. 2 BTCyi 0.1 ile başlayıp boğa piyasasında 2 ayda 2 BTC yapan insanlar biliyorum. 1 btcyi 0.2 olan arkadaşlarımıda gördüm. Panik yapmadan trade yapın. Tepeden alım yapmayın!
4082 2018-04-05 17:27:36 @arunjaitley Unfortunately RBI and you have been misled. Blockchain is the exact opposite of centralization. So don't try to create an Indian crypto. It won't work. And if it does, NaMo can't ban it at 8 o'clock on some random pretext (2/2)
4083 2018-04-05 17:27:34 Yeah I totaly get and support that! No matter what I do nobody should know it. However I don't want to support the drug business. I don't think that drugs can totally rek people, even more then recent crypto drop ;)
4084 2018-04-05 17:27:32 
4085 2018-04-05 17:27:31 Ah yes, Bitcoin is a soft fork of BCH which is a hardfork of Bitcoin. Makes sense.
4086 2018-04-05 17:27:26 Ah, the king of crypto with 24 whole followers...
4087 2018-04-05 17:27:24 That's awesome! Thanks for this video!
4088 2018-04-05 17:27:17 Insanity. I've been watching this unfold from afar. In a 24 hour period that's $7.5M of Verge being mined at the current $0.055996 price.
4089 2018-04-05 17:27:14 Banning crypto directly or indirectly, would be like digging our own graves, when others build bridges to future! In case of clear ban, India will loose huge money and interests of people in government/RBI @RBI @arunjaitley @PMOIndia

4095 2018-04-05 17:26:38 The Indian "Tech development" was not because they wanted to embrace tech... It was merely to get jobs (i.e. money). Crypto is a threat to banks, I'm not surprised if they're banning it.. It's the same logic - greed & money.
4096 2018-04-05 17:26:33 I've been using fractals and last bear to to set my lower bound which is $2.5-3k but the only way I can come close to sub $1k is a very bearish interpretation of metcalfes law.. open to all scenarios but how are you arriving at those target levels?
4097 2018-04-05 17:26:28 i can't feel sorry for them, i've been saying for a long time that it's a bad coin, if they don't want to listen, what can I do?

4102 2018-04-05 17:25:57 @arunjaitley Stifyling crypto investors in India is the equivalent of saying in the 90s - Don't invest in Infosys because it is New Tech (1/2)
4103 2018-04-05 17:25:57 @Daytrademaarten Let jij ffies op je kippen dan
4104 2018-04-05 17:25:43 Yes, it will be there. Most probably they'll introduce a crypto/crypto trading pair like binance. Plus RBI has given hints that it might launch it's own crypto, so all is not lost. Avoid panic selling. Internationally, crypto will always be accepted.
4105 2018-04-05 17:25:41 I was going to argue that while all of this sounds so everyday to us, he was still the first one to do it all, and without his fork we'd never have the vibrant crypto community that we have today. But if what @BTCNewsUpdates says is true then that changes things a li bit.
4106 2018-04-05 17:25:39 I support #Crypto Indian government you will ban it and that's why India will never succeed it is the future learn something from U.S. for once behave like educated people we are talking about the future of our country  @PMOIndia @RBI

4110 2018-04-05 17:25:08 @RBI  very bad idea to ban banks from dealing with crypto currency in india, while other developed countries are trying to make them as the crypto hub,it will surely affect future investments in india

4124 2018-04-05 17:24:20 Anyone that came in 2017 during the middle of a bull run & claims crypto is going to zero is an opportunist that got in late, doesn't give af about crypto, & is just trying to bleed crypto for all its worth for their own personal benefit. 

This is why we can't have nice things.

4245 2018-04-05 17:15:24 A crypto is analogous to a network, not a protocol. As many networks are connected by TCP/IP, so many cryptos will be connected by protocols like interledger.

Let's hope they respond soon.

4348 2018-04-05 17:07:40 Clayton: "[Exchange-traded funds] space is a retail space - we have a lot of retail protection, including asset validation ... in the crypto world, people are uncomfortable with it. How would you feel if the market could [fall] 30%? That's what happened on Friday."

Basically the same as Litecoin Leaders to follow, but rather leaders from all over the cryptosphere.

4394 2018-04-05 17:04:11 This a really irresponsible tweet. Some people may read it and inadvertently buy your product and think that they own #bitcoin.

RBI wants to get their own crypto - which will be centralized which defeats the whole purpose of why crypto was formed.

I know a guy that bought a crypto mining rig AND a 2018 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon on the basis that the crypto mining monthly cash flow will pay for the rig AND the Jeep payments...

Besides, in countries that aren't politically sound, only the few will enjoy the economic boom of crypto.

4646 2018-04-05 16:45:24 Instead of posting on Twitter, all exchanges should talk to each other and file a petition in the supreme court... If gov was planning to do this, why they send us the notice to pay the tax earned on crypto. Just bcoz of this, we assume that it's going to be legal in india

India should regulate crypto
Otherwise you will face the problem.

4897 2018-04-05 16:26:23 What an optimistic view. I like it. :) In a perfect world, that might work. Reality shows often enough that it's not that easy (not only, but especially in crypto) and people already tried many times to show why he's wrong. Call me a pessimist, but that's how it is.

4900 2018-04-05 16:26:07 Too much is at stake for RBI, innovation and legacy, the latter proved too heavy a price to pay. Social economic condition-not pretty, wealth distribution- highly skewed, so much is already causing an imbalance in the system. Don’t think they could embrace crypto at this point.
4901 2018-04-05 16:25:44 US, Japan, South Korea go towards regulating Cryptos so that their country progresses while RBI decides to block Indians from getting involved in the crypto revolution.

If it can achieve extremely low fees, then it still has a chance at dethroning various competing currencies. All crypto can do this, But I see bitcoin and litecoin.

4938 2018-04-05 16:22:20 You don't seem to grasp that "crypto" is no longer confined to a philosophical box.
It's like religion: there's God, and what man has done to God~ which is monetize it in the form of Religion.

5092 2018-04-05 16:10:20 why would you waste your time doubting or having those thoughts? i didnt get into crypto to fear and cry, i got in to support and help. I'm bullish on crypto, i own 66 coins (they said diversify) and I own stock, and fiat, and real estate. All of these can dissapear 'if'..
5093 2018-04-05 16:10:18 RBI hasn't declared VCs illegal it is just it has banned Indian banks to not provide any kind of services to crypto exchanges in India.
5094 2018-04-05 16:10:17 Why do you always mention BTC in comparison with XRP? Do you think it is the only competitor you have or will have in the future? It so different that you can't compare both things and, believe me or not, if btc fails one day, all crypto will sink for a few years at minimum.

5182 2018-04-05 16:02:50 Definitely, it should be legalized and the best way to do it is to kick this Govt. out and bring back Congress and its allies. They will definitely legalize Crypto to speed ahead with the Modern times. This govt. is taking India 67 years back rather than taking 67 years ahead.

5339 2018-04-05 15:52:11 You say coins need to pay to get listed and I say there is an alternative. Namely being a decentralized crypto that customers want. Nobody is paying to have BTC, XMR, BCH listed. This is my point.

5342 2018-04-05 15:51:56 The goal in fund management is risk management.

5467 2018-04-05 15:43:58 Governments and central banks are making fake promises that they are "protecting" investors by disallowing banks to facilitate crypto transactions, but in reality they are protecting their own interests so that banks dont go out of business.

5573 2018-04-05 15:36:32 I agree with you so long as the sales occur with exemptions. My concern was the selling to Ripple selling to smaller investors.  This is still uncharted by the SEC and they need to clarify their position on XRP and provide guidance for digital assets not being securities.

1) Massive sell-off $BTC two large organizations: Fortress + Mt.Gox trustee.

3) Most traders pioneers, people doubt, crypto will play a role today's society. Mainnets, when wallets are live, next mass adoption.

5605 2018-04-05 15:33:36 India has NOT BANNED crypto. But they banned Indian Banks and other RBI regulated agencies to stay away from business dealing with crypto. Don't just spread FUD.

5622 2018-04-05 15:32:40 Pretty soon all of crypto will no longer be phased by fud. So let them keep it up cuz any day now we will all be desensitized to fud and it won't work anymore. Already fud is having less of an effect.
5623 2018-04-05 15:32:30 Decentralized exchanges will eff them up, just wait. Government will be incapable of banning crypto just as they are with torrent clients

5629 2018-04-05 15:31:52 @QuadrigaCoinEx Why does account verification take so long? Many businesses try to make onboarding of new users as fast and seamless as possible. Only in crypto do you hear of making users wait weeks before they can use your services. Appalling!

5675 2018-04-05 15:28:37 Important to note that India makes up a tiny portion of crypto volume.

Other countries are taking a much more sensible, gentle regulatory approach which allows them to reap the benefits economically if they appear.

India's decision will only hurt and isolate it in the long run.

5741 2018-04-05 15:22:54 I wish people would #DYOR and not be taken by these scams, but I think it really hurts new investors who believe crypto is nothing but a Ponzi scheme. The prob with regulation, is once gov steps in, there is no controlling how much regulation they can do.

5750 2018-04-05 15:22:07 I think this is illegal pure and simple, cryptos are not an illegal asset, you cannot ban the purchase of something that in itself is legal, for f*ck sake we are talking about the purchase of 1 and 0. This will go to their highest courts and then they have to backtrack.
5751 2018-04-05 15:22:05 Today the long-awaited launch of the GRAM crypto currency will take place. You can buy tokens only today.

5757 2018-04-05 15:21:27 Yes, ideally I’d prefer no regulation, and let crypto currency be what it was designed to be to begin with. But look at what happened to the price after the SEC/CFTC hearings.

This is outright unconstitutional, has no legal basis and is open to and will be contested at all levels of the judiciary.

also RBI has given banks 3 months to abolish any ties with crypto-exchange meaning no more buying or selling crypto with INR fiat how big of an impact will this have on Indian crypto traders who reportedly comprise 7% of market.

5874 2018-04-05 15:12:04 It’s 11:11 make a wish! I’m wishing for people to stop talking about crypto currency at parties 
5875 2018-04-05 15:12:04 The move buys RBI more time to decide their long-term approach towards VCs.
5876 2018-04-05 15:11:59 つか、全部GCやるやる詐欺。素直に一回も通してないんだから逆にわかるだろ…。
5877 2018-04-05 15:11:58 No, that's call an opinion, not a fact. In my opinion, he's the best since Regan. But we can differ.

5881 2018-04-05 15:11:44 Most seen pattern by crypto trader these days:

Bart Simpson
5882 2018-04-05 15:11:37 If people in #crypto just didn't sell the prices on everything would skyrocket.. It's really yourselves that keep the prices low... Think about that..
5883 2018-04-05 15:11:24 It’s only fud when the news is blown out of proportion. How many alt coins have gave ‘donations’ to get on exchanges.. why target XRP?
5884 2018-04-05 15:11:23 great ICO
5885 2018-04-05 15:11:11 Lot of money (INR) had already gone out of India, The move is just a panic & desperate action to prevent further adoption ($BTC is very juicy to buy now than when it was at its ATH). So its quite obvious.
5886 2018-04-05 15:11:10 I don’t think the miners mind a dip to cool the markets.
5887 2018-04-05 15:11:04 まぁ、でも今の動きから次を予想しようねって話だわ。

5925 2018-04-05 15:08:25 In reflection of @VitalikButerin and @jcp and their public “call out” of fraudulent and dishonest behavior, I think the #crypto space would do well with more, not less, of these encounters.

5985 2018-04-05 15:03:43 Her point is the technology is steadily advancing, thus market retrenchments are Buffet-esque opportunities to pick up increasingly high quality assets on the cheap. Not all investors grok the Buffet strategy applied to crypto, but it’s likely the optimal one.

6020 2018-04-05 15:01:03 Seeing a lot of articles about banks preventing people from buying crypto. Sounds like they want to keep this investment vehicle to themselves.

6144 2018-04-05 14:51:06 Crypto has flipped the digital narrative on it's head

Previously it was all about digital abundance. Too cheap to meter. Free like beer. Zero marginal cost

With the advent of cryptoeconomics it's now  all about  digital  scarcity. Metered supply. Microtransactions. Pay to play
6145 2018-04-05 14:51:04 @koinexindia @zebpay @bitbns How are you guys dealing with the most fucked up news ever by the great RBI. People are panic selling and Indian #Crypto market is almost 15-20% down when compared globally.

6293 2018-04-05 14:40:25 I think which when Ico's be regulated,  Indian,  other countries and social media will allow they back. It's a time to crypto show his power. @officialmcafee did the first step to that way, doing a due diligence about some ICO's. It's just the beggin

6439 2018-04-05 14:30:33 There is no official claims, zero, that it will be listed in 3 days.  The person who originally posted this most likely misunderstood during the Huobi event.

6443 2018-04-05 14:30:27 Once more people own and use crypto (might not be $BTC) at a local or national level the value will stabilize. Then it can be a real currency. The value of fiat isn’t stable either but it’s more stable then crypto at this point, we need more adoption
6444 2018-04-05 14:30:23 Hey @RBI your today's decision to ban crypto currency in India has made a huge dent on India's image as pro business & technology.

But mainly I'm not very excited about the fact that ordinary people and companies can't take part in the distribution of money (ie mining).

6521 2018-04-05 14:24:29 Stable coins will play a huge part in the crypto economy moving forward - $USDT is the most well known and more like $TUSD will continue to come to market - competition is healthy!

6551 2018-04-05 14:22:36 Very well written Nischal , we are with you and all the indian exchanges . Its our money and we get to decide where we put it . we know the risks of crypto and till the time we are paying our taxes on our profits , no one has the right to tell us what we do. WE ARE WITH YOU
6552 2018-04-05 14:22:35 Nice one! :)
6553 2018-04-05 14:22:31 Mis-tweeted just now. Anyway, mindset. At this stage for a lot of people, putting ´real money' into crypto is even more risky than cashing out and risking missing higher prices.
6554 2018-04-05 14:22:23 There has been 51% attack on Verge. They said it’s fixed but the story is still not 100% clear.
6555 2018-04-05 14:22:21 @koinexindia  what the impact on ur business with latest RBI ruling asking banks to stop providing services to business dealing with crypto
6556 2018-04-05 14:22:19 Exactly. They're aiming to cut-off the fiat-crypto-fiat route within 3 months.
6557 2018-04-05 14:22:15 #Rogerver and #andreasantonopoulos are the reason that I got into Crypto.  He's always preaching about the powers that it has. He's not as bad as everyone makes him out to be. He truly wants what's best for bitcoin. Listen to what he has to say. Keep an open mind. #BitcoinCash
6558 2018-04-05 14:22:08 \o
6559 2018-04-05 14:22:04 They could have regulated the influx and outflux of money from and through exchanges.. but you know what crypto currencies are still legal.. by today's release they just restricted regular Indians from being the part of a great revolution of economic independence

6561 2018-04-05 14:21:55 Birikimin derinliğine göre değişmek üzere portföy en az %20 kripto para olmalı. Bu %20'nin:

6562 2018-04-05 14:21:40 To start a wallet company, you need license from RBI.

You got Payments bank license, you converted wallets into deposit accounts

To allow crypto transactions, RBI needs to give a nod to payments banks

The opinion doesn't arise that Paytm didn't allow crypto transactions.
6563 2018-04-05 14:21:40 Any countries that allow central banks to control what their citizens/customers can legally purchase with their money is NOT a Democracy.

6568 2018-04-05 14:21:19 @RBI  Banning Crypto Currency will stop us from exploring new areas of technology #IndiaforCrypto
6569 2018-04-05 14:21:15 The Verge community is the strongest crypto community there is, Verge can't be stopped. The best always get hated on but always seems to steadily rise to the top. Verge is the top cryptocurrency, It's inevitable. Let's Go!!!!!!!
6570 2018-04-05 14:21:13 Not a very well thought out decision by #RBI in cutting off transparent #FIAT investments & withdrawals from #Crypto. Over-the-counter trade will continue to flourish, many startups will die / never be born, country will lose taxes & project an anti-tech image internationally.
6571 2018-04-05 14:21:11 That was supposed to say darkhorse, and not farmhouse, but autocorrect
6572 2018-04-05 14:21:04 Such a bad decision by @RBI to ban crypto in India.

6588 2018-04-05 14:20:10 Nope. Not even close.
6589 2018-04-05 14:20:01 @RBI instead of banning crypto, the best way would be to regulate it. Blockchain is the next gen technology, crypto currencies are the incentive system for the blockchain to run. Consider regulating the crypto market or we will be isolated totally.

6603 2018-04-05 14:19:10 Every cryptocurrency presentation I've seen today really seems so washed out and stupid compared to Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoin Cash can really do everything. 

Although I definitely wish every crypto fan well and best of luck,  I now understand some of Craig Wright's frustration.
6604 2018-04-05 14:18:59 The purpose is to add liquidity, if demand was high in the Bitthumb then it makes sense the MM would send a pile that way.

6608 2018-04-05 14:18:36 Same as $WAX. Too many tokens locked up by the owners. If I sell you 1 $TRX  for $0.50 and I hold most myself, does that make me a multi-billionaire?

6610 2018-04-05 14:18:28 RBI has banned crypto currency.

Btw, 

there's a saying in Hindi..

6641 2018-04-05 14:16:39 Too funny. Famous computer people are being paid to make tweets supporting crypto currencies. All part of pump and dump schemes.
6642 2018-04-05 14:16:37 Okay so for any fiat - crypto transaction you would only be able to do OTC or use a foreign service which may be a grey area.

6699 2018-04-05 14:11:56 What do you mean with "BTC leaders"? Are you that unfamiliar of its history? There is no leader. It's an open source project. 

Don't compare it to the forked #shitcoin that is closed source, has no developers and is run by a cartel. 

There is only #bitcoin, nothing else.

6737 2018-04-05 14:09:01 The Reserve Bank of India has issued a directive to the banks & other Financial services institutions (e-wallets) to unwind their operations with crypto services (crypto exchanges/shops). It's not a ban in trading crypto assets but we won't be able to buy/liquidate it into fiat.
6738 2018-04-05 14:09:00 Another Ban by India! RBI banned Crypto this time...

6802 2018-04-05 14:04:33 I agree with the 3rd one. No one want to buy at peak but in reality almost in every asset class (e.g. equities, housing, crypto-currencies, ...) most number of people buy at peak (herd mentality).

2018: Delete Coinbase and cry about how much money you lost.

6976 2018-04-05 13:52:09 That's the loss for people who were thinking short term. One can always spend it to buy services that accept cryptos. I think by banning it they are making it more scare and hence more valueable. Btw Govt can't stop crypto transactions- there always a loopholes

6994 2018-04-05 13:50:57 #Bethereum is a social betting platform that connects people to play against each other, excluding bookmakers & betting agencies from the process. 
This means the money does not end up in a bookie's pocket, but remains with you, the players.  @bethereumteam
6995 2018-04-05 13:50:54 That can easily happen with small coins on exchanges like Cryptopia, but $ELF has pretty healthy volume and too big market cap to be manipulated just by one 100k account tweet imo.

7106 2018-04-05 13:43:44 Dont get your hopes high though. BTC might plunge further to 3000 if supports breaks at 6k  (according to people who predicted BTC diving to 6000). Tether your crypto and try not to catch falling knives.

7272 2018-04-05 13:32:58 #Bitcoin adoption is a pull, not a push. 

Business leaders will start to take notice that Lamborghini, Twitter, Robinhood, @CNBCFastMoney, etc are more successful because of their #crypto adoption. 

Others will want the same success.
7273 2018-04-05 13:32:57 You know I was contributing to CoinGeek WELL BEFORE Calvin took ownership of it.

I just don't want to support the Bankers that took over Bitcoin and hijacked its development. The evil is in what the bankers have done to it.

7392 2018-04-05 13:24:52 Yesterday drew attention to #SprintX. Read the opinions of experts, investors-really have every chance to take off if you invest in ICO. #SPTX #Ethereum #Crypto #BTC #ETH #BlockChain #ICO
7393 2018-04-05 13:24:47 OnLive solves bunch of problems from the offline world where one needs direct face-to-face
contact with a professional to get essential advice. This is often problematic and costly #Crypto #Blockchain #invest #ICO #profit #Crowdfunding #OnLive #Streaming #TokenSale
7394 2018-04-05 13:24:46 Went from sleeping at 6 am to waking up at 6 am within days. All for the opening bell. I wish there was just one stock market worldwide and it would open 24/7 and trade on crypto currencies.
7395 2018-04-05 13:24:35 Is it ravencoin ?

IMPORTANT UPDATE   CRYPTO is NOT banned by RBI, News is that all the entity under RBI will not deal in cryptos. There is no ban on payment made to exchanges. Like bank deals with dollar - pound selling n buying, that's it.
7440 2018-04-05 13:20:35 It does not means ban crypto.Many scams took place directly related to INR.Should we ban INR??
7441 2018-04-05 13:20:34 *BIG CRYPTO LEVELS* Bitcoin $BTC $6400, Ripple $XRP $0.43, Ethereum $ETH $360. These are all key prices at the bottom of key supporting range, that I can see respectively. Breaches are pending, buckle your seat belts if they occur. #cryptocurrency
7442 2018-04-05 13:20:32 No idea what you just said. You can't spell, your grammar is worse than my nephew's who is five years old and you expect me to provide you with counter arguments to your uneducated claims? This is exactly why I block dimwits like you people. You are helpless. GTFO
7443 2018-04-05 13:20:24 Not that relevant imo. There are many #crypto related groups on FB. Yes, Twitter has much better community, but not everyone comes to explore it. For example I entered crypto in 2016 but created my Twitter account just a month ago after I deleted my FB.
7444 2018-04-05 13:20:19 Good job Eric! In the crypto space we need serious companies like yours. That works transparently and always 100% confirms the next move to not let the community down.

7478 2018-04-05 13:17:30 State bank of sikkim is not regulated by RBI so crypto exchange in india can tie up with this bank
7479 2018-04-05 13:17:27 Yes it can!  Look at 12 - 17 Feb amd 26 Feb - 4 March this year. According to TradingView each of those periods experianced a $2,000+ jump with less volume than we've seen over the last few days.  Lower liquidity means that less is needed to move the market.

7488 2018-04-05 13:16:49 and if you read the article they are not banning anything. You can still buy crypto there. Its obvious Super Crypto is on to something, they are trying to slow the traction of crypto in certain parts of the world. In reality this will drive people TOWARDS it quicker

7511 2018-04-05 13:14:55 Decentralized application for sharing crypto-currencies for fiat money without intermediaries @streamityorg is based on smart contracts. An interesting decision and a team. #Streamity #StreamityICO #ICO
7512 2018-04-05 13:14:51 Interestingly, the suppression isn’t a result of any sort of actual physical exchange or ownership... it’s all paper manipulation. There is oftentimes 100x as much gold being traded on paper than actually exists in the real world.

7514 2018-04-05 13:14:46 China's internet is way more advanced than the internet you know. It is decentralising and has way more AI than the western internet.
Remember also it is a different business culture. Plagiarism is almost encouraged, especially if you can do it cheaper, better and for the masses.
7515 2018-04-05 13:14:45 And Indian RBI bans #Bitcoin and #vIrtual currencies. No banks or ewallets to support Crypto Community in India

7558 2018-04-05 13:10:48 maybe the truth is people aren’t buying crypto because they think it’s a scam because the prices never go up. they have a point. there doesn’t seem to a floor on any of these crypto coins. it makes you wonder if it is a scam.

7617 2018-04-05 13:06:38 Trading and holding is not Banned. I don't think this is affecting bitcoin much here.

Infact, I am sure RBI or/and Giants here are launching own Crypto Currency soon.

7620 2018-04-05 13:06:37 Yes of course there is a couple pow coins left in crypto. Most tokens have the entire supply distributed from the beginning and if it's a POS coin that does 10% yearly and you're staking you will increase with the inflation.

7633 2018-04-05 13:05:31 BBB har tagit bort infon om att använda port 25 för utgående mail. De anger att port 465 eller 587 ska användas. Jag jämförde med den cacheade versionen. Min postfix klagar på "unknown crypto" när jag testar. Jag använde ju port 25 (och TLS) tidigare.
7634 2018-04-05 13:05:27 no way bears have this much ammo unless they’re purposely taking huge losses to bring down crypto for some unknown reason.

The adoption isn't in what we're selling, it's in the fact that someone can knock up a store in 30 minutes - as stated. BCH stores up in 30 minutes - I wonder how long it takes for a Lightning store... hmm

7683 2018-04-05 13:02:24 Besided that I think the whole crypto market is allot of air. Every crypto has it's vision on what it could be, but no one has something that could really be used in real life. Global payments with your phone... nice but how in the world are you gonna do that? Every
7684 2018-04-05 13:02:10 So is this a study for BTC or is it the general EW statistics? Thanks!

Plus crypto currency will fail due to it's nature.
A person can only be rich in crypto currency and survive provided there's a network. If you choose to live offgrid/offline then bartering will be difficult.

Wait for confirmation or flip a coin and stop loss. One is smarter than the other.
7697 2018-04-05 13:00:52 Group your #crypto into segregated wallets by cost-basis so you can control exactly which coins you are selling. If you had to sell today, would you rather sell the #bitcoin purchased at $1000, or the #btc you purchased at $15,000?  If you didn’t segregate, you can’t choose.

7744 2018-04-05 12:56:49 #bitcoin I keep seeing articles about how Bitcoin is worthless. Not true I think all crypto are suffering as the community restless with the growing pains of turning the idea they have into an actual mass use product. 2019 is a breakout year, buy in on the floor this year of 2-3k
7745 2018-04-05 12:56:46 Some say that “Money is the root of all evil” I was naive enough to think crypto may be the exception in the beginning when in fact it’s proven worse. Maybe if we took greed outta the equation and just dropped what we can afford to loose then maybe we’d all get along.

7752 2018-04-05 12:56:02 What I'm clarifying is nobody can ban any crypto. They can just stop banks from giving supports and order people not to use any crypto. That's it.
7753 2018-04-05 12:56:00 This is going to continue all the way down. 7-6   6-5  5-4   4-3   3-2   2-1 breaking the will of the holders

7755 2018-04-05 12:55:51 Exchanges will collaborate with other payment gateways besides the ones under rbi. They are not closing down exchanges. They have given a 3 month window, nothing is final yet. Everything will move on as it is. Everyone wants cheap Bitcoins, governments and banks most desperately.

7815 2018-04-05 12:52:34 Laughable when the banks don't allow the purchase of Crypto to "protect" us, but will lend us way more than we can afford for a home because they can just take it when can't afford it.  I bet they'll have no issue when they figure out how to get a cut of it though.

7818 2018-04-05 12:52:21 What's more interesting is that Indian govt has acted very oblivious as if they don't understand anything and the technology goes above their heads. Not sure whether it's acting or high level conspiracy.
7819 2018-04-05 12:51:59 How do you know?
7820 2018-04-05 12:51:53 Ya true, but its not fud , its actual instruction from rbi to banks
7821 2018-04-05 12:51:46 They're trying to turn USA into cucked socialist Europe, where rich childless women control everything. God help us.

7833 2018-04-05 12:50:35 XD ... it's not a crypto-currency, but maybe they will transform xrp into one
7834 2018-04-05 12:50:34 There is no need to prove anything, I have never even seen any article from Bloomberg with a positive sound on #cryptocurrency. I guess they don't like change, this happens sometimes, especially if you date from 1929!

7839 2018-04-05 12:50:29 It's not a bribe since crypto is not regulated....... Anyways, money coming in is better than money going out for the market (Recent pump n dumps with Centra etc....)
7840 2018-04-05 12:50:19 when there is a will there is a way.  Hackers have found a way around everything.  There is no India anymore, there are no borders in crypto.  Find a way and make it happen before it gets too late

7865 2018-04-05 12:47:24 1/ Today the Reserve Bank of #India issued a circular telling "entities registered with the RBI" (essentially banks, financial firms) to stop working with crypto exchanges and businesses. The Indian government, hasn't banned #crypto.

7869 2018-04-05 12:47:01 India banning crypto is a non-event:
Largest Indian exchanges by daily volume:

Zebpay $7.7 mln
Unocoin $1.7 mln
Coinsecure $0.14 mln

I doubt there's significant merchant penetration in India. They can still use Localbitcoins, which I understand already is the main fiat onramp.

7871 2018-04-05 12:46:49 IMPORTANT UPDATE   CRYPTO is NOT banned by RBI, News is that all the entity under RBI will not deal in cryptos. There is no ban on payment made to exchanges. Like bank deals with dollar - pound selling n buying, that's it.
7872 2018-04-05 12:46:48 The issue is twofold. First, partisanship has pushed both sides to the extreme. Additionally, the Right in the US has been sliding g right for 35 years. Combine the two and you get people think that the D's in the US are far left.

7893 2018-04-05 12:45:07 A catch-22 they call it. Under my 'assumption' that grumpy miners, owning a lot of $BTC switching it for $BCH, are driving the price down by selling $BTC. Dragging the whole market down. $BCH -85% since ATH. Good luck guys. Now you bought a lot of your own coin and still lost.

Thai government promptly ignores the said letter and proceed to legalise crypto currency usage in Thailand.

It is up to the people and not the Central Bank.
7962 2018-04-05 12:39:25 But I buy bitcoin in conventional currency, no ? Which does not fluctuate as radically as the crypto.

Stability of money (inflation) is desirable for a predictable economy.

7964 2018-04-05 12:39:18 Thoughts of a #crypto hodler.

 Why the hell did you invest?
What made you invest? 

 Short it & make more.
Don’t get greedy. 

 Hurry, before you lose more.
Patience is the key. 

 SELL!
Hodl.

7965 2018-04-05 12:39:12 Interesting interpretation, but no real parallels to Keynesianism. "I define Crypto-Keynesianism as a perspective where moving money through the economy is more important than perhaps an extra level of security around the money itself."

8175 2018-04-05 12:16:57 @RBI and because of regressive institutions like you, India is, and will continue to remain a third world country, always looking towards the west for innovation! To ban banks from dealing in crypto was the best regulation you could come up with?  retards...

8184 2018-04-05 12:15:52 Don’t think so
8185 2018-04-05 12:15:50 Doing that wouldn't make it a security. They are already active trying to get it on exchanges. The howey test is what determines what's a security. It doesn't seem that xrp is that. It's not a share of ripple Etc. Just a utility token.

8214 2018-04-05 12:12:59 Awesome idea.
8215 2018-04-05 12:12:56 Dude, for someone who does not know anything about it, you sure have a knack for it!  So many talented people in this community!
8216 2018-04-05 12:12:37 shutdown within 3 months ?
8217 2018-04-05 12:12:32 Ive said it before, and ill say it again.. expect blood on the streets as big money/funds/wall st notice that there is money to be made in crypto. 
Watch the professionals squeeze your bags out & clean up! Only a controlled compilation of good news will start this bull.. 
8218 2018-04-05 12:12:17 I predict that the next FUD news will be that aliens will stop buying bitcoin and ban crypto from the galaxy
8219 2018-04-05 12:11:51 I remember reading an article on Business Insider that said some exchanges charge up to a million. So yes, it is

8226 2018-04-05 12:11:07 FUD= Fear uncertainty doubt

If that announcement doesn't create any of the above in any Indian crypto holder I don't know what could.

8237 2018-04-05 12:09:34 They like Blockchain, but not crypto currency. Obviously very lame. Blockchain can not exist without crypto currency, because there is no way to secure network if there is no economic advantage for miners/stakers.

8312 2018-04-05 12:02:05 Not much. We don't accept Fiat currency, so no involvement with the RBI regulated entities. But in general, the trust in the crypto would goes down, and that affects every product!
8313 2018-04-05 12:01:59 This isn't a ban .. it's saying regulated financial institutions can't offer crypto services.. no change really.. the regulated institutions aren't offering these services anyway. And those that do aren't regulated!!

8417 2018-04-05 11:50:59 I think it is not illegal as RBI didn't ban on crypto currency other than they directed RBI regulated entities to stop providing service who deals in Bitcoin. It mean you can still buy and sell Bitcoin but not with the Indian money.

8439 2018-04-05 11:48:24 Yes, you are right. The reason given by RBI is to stop money laundering but motivated people can always use such service to launder if they want. They don't even need crypto for that. India will lag behind the rest of the world in adopting this potential revolution. Bigger risk!

8482 2018-04-05 11:43:48 I am sharing this sentiment. Feels shaky though. My hope is that $btc is going sideways for a long while (as suggested by ETH researchers), which could lead to people being more open to trade alts.
8483 2018-04-05 11:43:46 .@kpchand07 Indeed there would be ways for people to get around this, but this would seriously hinder crypto adoption in India at least in short term.
Also, this is really bad for emerging crypto trading platforms like @zebpay @koinexindia @coindelta_ to name a few

8502 2018-04-05 11:42:05 pretty bad. I've came from India 7 days ago and had some discussion with crypto people who were pretty excited about the evolution of the exchanges which appeared. Still the head of the national bank called Bitcoin "a ponzi scheme" 2-3 weeks ago so I am not amazed by the news.
8503 2018-04-05 11:42:03 Ooops, when will NZ journalists/everyone start using crypto?
8504 2018-04-05 11:41:56 Only digital currencies are far more comfortable than gold standard ever was. Secondly, you can't judge bitcoin/crypto by its performance so far since it's a crawling child.
8505 2018-04-05 11:41:55 I still don't get it, govt says crypto is not a legal tender(which means it's for investing purposes) but now it prohibits banks from allowing people to invest in crypto. What the F is going on ? #cryptocurrency #RBI #ban
8506 2018-04-05 11:41:38 Do you guys dream about crypto?
8507 2018-04-05 11:41:34 Mirowski sounds like Polish name. @Crypto_VokAin was in Poland few days ago. Some experienced person could make joke out of it, but since I'm not....Just information :D
8508 2018-04-05 11:41:28 I still don't get it, govt says crypto is not a legal tender(which means it's for investing purposes) but now it prohibits banks from allowing people to invest in crypto. What the F is going on ?
8509 2018-04-05 11:41:22 It's true. Expect Indian exchanges to either shut shop or move to crypto-to-crypto trading. Definitely a step backwards.

8547 2018-04-05 11:37:30 I bought two more masternodes recently: NTRN and ALQO. Even at these prices, running the nodes is profitable on a "lunch money" level, and downside risk seems small for crypto standards. If the coins should reach January highs again, well, *shudder*.

8558 2018-04-05 11:36:35 Yes being the highest financial authority who control banks they have directed all the banks to shut shop buying Crypto, there will be a panic sell from India which might see Bitcoin and others go more down.

8637 2018-04-05 11:29:16 I’ve gotten better at mitigating risks and decreasing $btc value decline in bear markets. It gets better as in every bull run yields your account at new highs.

8640 2018-04-05 11:28:46 With the rise of Decentralised exchanges such as Kyber Network, Airswap and NEX, should the traditional centralised entities be worried? #cryptolingo #fintech #BTC #blockchain #crypto #ethereum #exchanges
8641 2018-04-05 11:28:42 Classic! You can feel disgusted of a scammer that got thousands Rekt with total lack of shame guilt or remorse. But you can’t feel disgusted for those thousand he destroyed  that doesn’t have a voice! The problem is that most humans emit an opinion without some deep thinking.

8646 2018-04-05 11:27:49 Central Banks over the last decade simply created credit out of thin air. Snap a finger, and credit magically appears. Only central banks can perform this type of credit magic. It’s called printing money.

Where's the real scam?

8671 2018-04-05 11:25:00 From today Indian banks cannot deal crypto.

debate in Riks, BoE, BoC is CBDC money/tokens will take precedence in times of Fin panic so it is dangerous to banking system.

All of them clueless about Crypto imo

8722 2018-04-05 11:18:46 This platform is a prime example of what a future crypto-world might look like. In order for cryptocurrency to pick up massive adoption, in the long run, a variety of use cases and value propositions is necessary.
8723 2018-04-05 11:18:43 That's why you can't keep your funds on an exchange. Even if that happened (globally), our crypto would be safe in our wallets (or most of them, especially if they're open source). This is the power of crypto.

8770 2018-04-05 11:12:35 Regulation is a huge part of the FA picture right now. ICO scams also weigh on the space, affecting how people view crypto as a whole. I've been trading for a long time. In my experience TA is often a leading indicator for FA, or rather the move "makes sense" in hindsight.

8896 2018-04-05 10:57:03 False. Overpopulation is but a symptom mismanaged resources. Poverty is the direct result of mismanaged resources. But yea speculation on crypto is definitely a gamble; a gamble where you can inspect the deck after you placed your bet

8908 2018-04-05 10:55:45 That won't work. You can't ban crypto. This is just gonna cause a lot of OTC dealing and therefore black money generation. Congrats Indian govt

TL;DR - RBI has effectively told banks to not deal with Cryptocurrencies or assets in any form or fashion. You can't use your fiat to buy Crypto which would mean Indian Crypto exchanges would be rendered useless.

問題なのは、ある閾値を設けたときです。VIX＞１以上でかつシグナルが出たとき、とするのはどうだろうか、ということです。

9052 2018-04-05 10:38:16 The good thing crypto is the volatility and the good thing is everyone can profit or lose quickly depending on their actions. If you are to stupid to buy without doing your research then shame on you. If you havent lost then you probably havent learned.

9056 2018-04-05 10:37:44 Truth about Poloniex. It has been observed when rate goes down Poloniex doesn't release crypto withdrawal. It keeps holding traders crypto currency and indirectly forced to sell crypto at lower cost.

9186 2018-04-05 10:16:36 I made 1700 understanding that crypto doesnt need any use cases , as long as a coin is tradeable you can make a profit on it, when you understand this, you’ll understand why i made the decision based on that, yes it was risky, but i was confident about my move .

9467 2018-04-05 09:43:43 This is just my toughts. Crypto market is violent and not much volume so the price is "easy" to move. Bulls and bears push it to certine fib lvls and elliot counts that is valid for everyone else to get "help" from the public traders. So in crytpo it works well.

9472 2018-04-05 09:43:01 Mentioning Vitalik or any of the other crypto researchers *who actually produced something that can be scrutinized* is not an appeal to authority. They have easily proven merit. Craig Wright simply does not beyond his constant cries for attention over his academic degrees.
9473 2018-04-05 09:43:01 $crypto trading 101:
Plan trades beforehand

1) Determine targets in advance
2) Reduce risks by choosing partial profit target
3) Stop-loss orders (some prefer while others not)
4) Do not be afraid to question yourself

Good planning lead to prosperity.

9476 2018-04-05 09:42:31 They act as if they are trying to protect us.boasting about how the economy is doing so well and telling us not to invest in crypto. Another economic crash is coming.
Banks are handing out rediculous lines of credit and people are taking the bait this is how they keep control.

9548 2018-04-05 09:33:13 This is the first post you've made that I can agree with. Once regulation comes in to play (and it's coming, partly here already), the weak coins and hands will fold, institutional money will come in and the crypto/digital asset space will mature a bit more.

3) ETF's approval
4) crypto legal structure adoption

9603 2018-04-05 09:27:05 Also before crying out trying to roast Rofl your just jealous. If you could get the amount of money he did from trading you would change your view. You probably say the same shit about crypto currency’s that it’s not a “proper job”.

9607 2018-04-05 09:26:25 I love XRP and the community but you guys completly lost your mind. A Price of 12,500 $ would meen a marketcap of 1.25 quadrillion. Thats more than all existing derivatives. Insane !!!

9611 2018-04-05 09:25:56 Dude, do you even Crypto???
9612 2018-04-05 09:25:55 CoinmarketCap has false indications on almost all cryptocurrencies (Number of tokens, circulating supply) compare BNB for example on CMC and Binance website !
9613 2018-04-05 09:25:48 Sure, why not?!  I will buy back some and give it try. It seems a lot has changed since last time I held xrp back in December.

9617 2018-04-05 09:25:31 Disagreeing is fine. Everyone-EVERYONE- should draw the line when it comes to censorship. It has no place in crypto, despite it being common place somewhere like r/bitcoin. Do we really want conferences to be like r/bitcoin? @VitalikButerin you spoke out against censorship before
9618 2018-04-05 09:25:26 I think crypto will more grow next upcoming 2 to 5 years
9619 2018-04-05 09:25:24 We almost hit 1 Tr mc last time... (850 Bn at ATH )

9638 2018-04-05 09:24:03 Is it a good time to invest in ICOs?
The market is red, but successful ICOs will have a good chance of tanking with the next positive market correction. Buying into an ICO is an investment into a company more than into a currency.

9639 2018-04-05 09:23:45 Bitcoin is what consensus says it is.  Right now it's $BTC.  It would be sad if #BitcoinCash was #Bitcoin, given that it's only a little over 4% of the entire crypto market cap.

9776 2018-04-05 09:04:57 Smart move. Hold & buying more is the best strategy at these low/ choppy prices. I believe we are very close to the bottom. Regulations will kill many scam ICO, giving a piece of mind to new comers which will  bring more liquidity to a few solid projects left out there.
9777 2018-04-05 09:04:52 Mate, you give so much to the crypto community. You deserve a stronger following. Keep it coming. Cheers
9778 2018-04-05 09:04:37 I think if money isn't going into ETH then into the ICO's wallets then likely into FIAT, then more money stays in the system. Lets be honest most of the ICOs are a load of crap, most of what they are doing don't need a blockchain - so they fail and exit.
