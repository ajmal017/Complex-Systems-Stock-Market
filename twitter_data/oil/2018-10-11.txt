55 2018-10-11 23:54:20 Fun fact:
Wind and solar provide 0.4 % of global energy and use 275 tons of coal to produce 1 turbine. With the current amount of turbines it takes 50 million tons of coal per year. This doesn’t include the fuel of transport or the oil and grease to upkeep a unit

62 2018-10-11 23:53:11 It went directly over Tyndall AFB! Somebody on my fb actually posted a photo of a "portable HAARP ball" on an oil rig within sight of the shore.... don't know how real it is... Also just found a video via fb friend saying it was targeted... still watching it.
63 2018-10-11 23:53:05 His parents have a business supplying food to oil platforms so their best interest would be fracking to fail. Hardly a conflict of interest if it’s not his business most of us have an interest in oil if you have a pension you are investing in the oil industry.
64 2018-10-11 23:53:04 You'd said the science is unsettled on climate change. It's not. Commercial cattle farms produce vast quantities of methane and contribute to deforestation. I'm all for sustainable farming (recent study shows 2% seaweed in cattle feed reduces methane) but cows + oil are problems.
65 2018-10-11 23:53:01 I honestly give the edge to Benning. Garrison has the same description but does not have the "5" of the 5/6/7/8 description. Benning moves the puck better and skates better. Garrison does do other things better than Benning but skating and passing are in demand.

71 2018-10-11 23:52:22 Yeah too bad there is no profit in saving the earth. Or doing anything good for humanity. Everything that makes profit seems bad for humanity, oil, pesticides, radiation. Ignoring safety regulations, fracking the earth, letting animals go extinct, poring trash into water...
72 2018-10-11 23:52:08 Saudi Arabia should not be allowed to think its oil is a shield. The United States values are more important than any drop of Saudi oil. One day Saudi  oil will run dry, our values will never  run dry.

76 2018-10-11 23:51:59 Richard, you don’t need to frack in residential areas to have oil and gas. Should we point to the future? $6 trillion has been divested worldwide and it’s dying a quicker death than previously thought. PS- We are in a climate crisis. Start reading the news.

91 2018-10-11 23:50:10 That’s crazy! I don’t understand why the states are banning the oil, I guess because it actually helps people!

95 2018-10-11 23:49:57 We always carry the latest spot price forward, so are agnostic on direction. But what will help Turkey is that oil import volumes will fall along with activity, so there is a price and a quantity side to the story.
96 2018-10-11 23:49:43 In addition to those social reforms, through his Vision 2030 initiative, he's pushing to diversify the Saudi economy away from environmentally destructive oil extraction (currently making up about 40% of GDP) and towards more sustainable directions. /4

98 2018-10-11 23:49:39 I agree w/ @brettachapman. The DNC candidate for Gov. of IL is an owner of ETP oil corp. Same corp building the DAPL & crossing through Standing Rock. Is it coincidence that the ND side has suddenly lost voting rights? (I'm from the SD side but live in IL)

Those are the shittest, do you mean petro pegged to oil (50%) and complete supply controlled by shitty government, giving maduro relentless control, negating purpose of decentralisation. I read that only petro can be accepted for passports and goods. It's more a cover-up.

115 2018-10-11 23:48:23 The US Congress could declare war on Venezuela and seize Venezuelan oil fields but that doesn't mean it's a good idea either.  How would you get an actual warrant for Trump's returns if you had too? What is the "probable cause"...some idiotic conspiracy theory about Russians?

121 2018-10-11 23:47:36 The US’ relationship with SA is deplorable - all for oil. We have enriched the what? 10,000? SA royals and ignored the human rights abuses. When are these middle eastern countries going to have revolutions to overthrow these corrupt regimes?
122 2018-10-11 23:47:26 We have these Nowcasts across all systemic EMs, including Turkey. So our view that we have held since mid August that Turkey’s current account could move into surplus folds that in. Important to remember that oil import volumes for Turkey will fall sharply as activity weakens.
123 2018-10-11 23:47:07 We are stricter in some things but I work in regulatory for oil and gas so no, not correct. And before everyone freaks out I’m pro oil and gas development.
124 2018-10-11 23:47:07 Robe, jewelry, tan, posing oil, and butt glue all was delivered to me today by my sweet angelic friend. Starting to all feel real. 6 months ago when I said I was gonna compete... I was looking ahead to moments like this. Almost there. LETS GO
125 2018-10-11 23:47:06 You bet!  Split them and toss them into a plastic bag with some S&V and oil and shake well. Drain and microwave for a minute. Toss them directly on to the smoker rack for the last half hour or so.
126 2018-10-11 23:46:57 2nd time at this yoga studio today...i lathered coconut oil at the ends of my hair - because the heat damages it - and im not in that....

I am very aware the snake oil sells.  No matter how high those numbers are, it still lacks integrity 

Maybe you should reevaluate what you are praising.
136 2018-10-11 23:45:35 ぽは！
137 2018-10-11 23:45:22 People in the entire world realize that global  warming is real. The GOP denies this fact because it conflicts with the GOP support for and from the oil industry. The Democrats agree with the world that we must control global warming. VOTE BLUE. Support democrats.

139 2018-10-11 23:45:16 Is there any other way to make baked potatoes? Sometimes you can sub coconut oil for the butter on the outside if you’re worried you won’t have enough butter for the inside
140 2018-10-11 23:45:14 ぽきた
141 2018-10-11 23:45:14 Coconut oil, good for skin and smells nice
142 2018-10-11 23:45:11 You make a sad-but-true point. #FeelsBadMan
143 2018-10-11 23:44:52 Albino bruce, God will shame u all. Cos pmb refuses to share money or allocate oil blocks to u looters, u think u can incite the masses against him. U can do so with some igbos.
144 2018-10-11 23:44:48 The British also aid #Nigeria killed Biafrans in 1967_1970, and the same #British is still sucking our oil in #Biafra land, after they had killed 3.5 million Biafrans Botha adults and children. The world leaders should take note, #British is evil indeed. FREEDOM FOR BIAFRA
145 2018-10-11 23:44:41 きのういろいろあってちとブルーですが今日も生きる
146 2018-10-11 23:44:35 I pour olive oil down my throat every night before i take my little vitamins and watch my new jack matches.
147 2018-10-11 23:43:43 Where can I get your oil?
148 2018-10-11 23:43:38 そして今年をもって引退

151 2018-10-11 23:43:28 a went to see this show called artic oil and a canny get out my head that people don’t believe in global fucking warming
152 2018-10-11 23:43:19 Knitting and listening to audio books. Or handspinning and listening to audio books. Or sitting in a probably too-hot bath with lavender oil cubes tossed in & a big glass of red wine. My go-to book lately has been Absolute Monarchs: A History of the Papacy.
153 2018-10-11 23:42:59 Like the oil sand workers in the Dakotas working 7 days a week? Record number of platforms in the Gulf. Dude. Kylo Ren, Come away from the dark side. Join us and open your eyes to some truth for a change.
154 2018-10-11 23:42:33 whoops, what about the oil?
155 2018-10-11 23:42:06 Sure but that's not on the player or coach. There are no other options
156 2018-10-11 23:42:04 While I enjoyed my car purchasing experience at @RussellWes_CDJR - the service department is in serious need of improvement. 4+ hours for an “express” oil change w/ no ability to schedule an appointment is completely unacceptable. I could have watched an entire @russwest44 game.
157 2018-10-11 23:41:40 Loopholes can always be closed.

This guy has got to get the hell out of here.

Seriously.

My fellow Americans.

This guy promises one thing and does the other.

He is an old world snake oil salesmen.

He and his friends will get richer, we will get poorer.
158 2018-10-11 23:41:34 Add multi-level marketing and snake oil sales. 

Saddest thing of all is that it’s killing a viable technology with lots of potential.
159 2018-10-11 23:41:15 I call it Polluti oil.
160 2018-10-11 23:41:11 And I'm here to make you drown in oil.
161 2018-10-11 23:41:11 I'm sorry Lunarteddy..have you tried Lyrica? It helps with  sleep and pain. Also CBD oil helps... Hugs 
162 2018-10-11 23:41:10 Hopefully the ridiculously bloodthirsty MBS will be removed, but the U.S. won't abandon Saudi oil or arms sales.
163 2018-10-11 23:40:52 What in Tarnation Granny I think them #Bruins boys struck Oil 3 times tonight
164 2018-10-11 23:40:47 I absolutely REFUSE to wear makeup in humid weather conditions like my face produces so much oil already
165 2018-10-11 23:40:44 Mainly oil but with butter tastes better 
166 2018-10-11 23:40:42 Wondering if they buy a bunch of Saudi oil?
167 2018-10-11 23:40:35 すっかりバルカロールも寒くなったなー。へくしっ
168 2018-10-11 23:40:34 Netflix and Android box for 5 years, finally paid for cable so that I didn't have to find streams for Edmonton sports (Oil/Esks). I've watched 2 games a piece and I think I need a refund.
169 2018-10-11 23:40:15 The womb destruction oil well style 
170 2018-10-11 23:40:13 迷うなあサラダ油なの？ごま油なの？どっちが好きなの？
171 2018-10-11 23:40:08 Valvoline Instant Oil Change will fill tires for free. No purchase necessary. Just FYI.
172 2018-10-11 23:40:01 Oh I always want bread, and olive oil to dip it in.
173 2018-10-11 23:39:48 Half the time I see diet now I'm seeing palm oil.
174 2018-10-11 23:39:44 It’s an essential oil. I’ve been using it the last couple of years and I really haven’t gotten sick.
175 2018-10-11 23:39:44 When it is winter they have to add a chemical to the gas to prevent it from freezing. Cost more which raises prices. President does not control the cost of a barrel of oil or the refinery process haha. Somethings are actually just market driven.
176 2018-10-11 23:39:31 i have a theory that the flavor of Max's chicken is from using cooking oil that was used to fry pork chicharon or the likes
177 2018-10-11 23:39:24 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
178 2018-10-11 23:39:24 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
179 2018-10-11 23:39:24 Valvoline Instant Oil Change will fill tires for free. No purchase necessary. Just FYI.
180 2018-10-11 23:39:24 I remember seeing that oil painting in an old dinosaur documentary when I was a little kid in the early 90s. It really stuck with me for some reason.
181 2018-10-11 23:39:21 Why Would he be in Canton...who in their right mind would listen to this snake oil salesman...what is wrong with Canton? Sad day...sad day indeed!
182 2018-10-11 23:39:17 Maybe they should just rename it granola oil.
183 2018-10-11 23:39:14 He doesn't know the first thing about oil, never mind tight formations. Never seen or stepped foot on a rig or anything involved in oil. Yet, $ati.v $ati accepted this twit as a BOD? come on, invest in this company now. Holy, this just gets better. Keep talking, i want more!
184 2018-10-11 23:39:08 Just heard a train carrying oil just hit a car on P St. So glad it didn't derail the train.
Don't feel like being incinerated.
185 2018-10-11 23:39:05 No shit! You seem pretty stressed about the calming oil! 
186 2018-10-11 23:39:03 Granny What in Tarnation them #Bruins Struck Oil Eeedoggies
187 2018-10-11 23:39:03 I’ve always been under the impression tackling oil was the mainstay of skincare bc blare is my skincare info source and that’s her priority and knowledge-base. She knows about All The Products. (Lots of korean stuff?)
188 2018-10-11 23:39:01 @pettycommajared While you were podcasting, I was investigating a solution to your candy corn problem.  Amazon sells sugar free candy corn flavoring oil.  I would suggest adding it to a keto white chocolate fudge recipe for the most similar experience to store bought candy corn.
189 2018-10-11 23:38:10 That didn't take long, Trump and Lankford have already supported the same people that attacked America on 9/11, all for oil and gas money. Everyone in the OK delegation would rather stand with Russia and the Saudis vs America for $$$'s. Wake up OK!!!!
190 2018-10-11 23:38:09 I once used the sunflower oil from my pancakes as lip gloss  I was too lazy to go upstairs and get anything and my lips were dry.
191 2018-10-11 23:38:03 the last comment  I  heard by the Mayor  is  that he  is  still returning to his office tonight, (time unknown) so you may  want to  burn the  midnight  oil  if  interested...
192 2018-10-11 23:38:01 This beard oil working miracle. It’s growing faster than expected lol
193 2018-10-11 23:37:46 I got almond oil in the carpet :0 o lordt
194 2018-10-11 23:37:42 Both Bushes were dirty with Saudi oil, and Tillerson was too. But they all knew one thing: Once you're in the WH, you have to keep at least the perception of distance. Jared and Trump went all in, taking their bribes thinking they could do so with impunity.They are beyond F**ked
195 2018-10-11 23:37:30 US long rates stabilizing, oil squeeze attenuating, Chinese junk bonds picking up, yuan stabilizing, US stocks near end of blackout period, and Xi-Trump just agreed to a G-20 meeting. Wouldn't want to be one of those record shorts in AUD ...
196 2018-10-11 23:37:22 Won’t you just be one very surprised  “researcher”!  Don’t burn the midnight oil! You’ll still be wrong in the morning - and tired !
197 2018-10-11 23:37:17 Oil coach checking his roster - who the hell was that guy?
198 2018-10-11 23:37:17 Plus science is very bad...bad bad bad, we must NEVER speak of the effects of our human footprint on our planet...NEVER. We must NOT act to limit climate change...like NEVER. Burn coal, oil, frack and burn it all! GO REPUBLICANS & TEAM TRUMP! Screw the world, &our grandchildren!!
199 2018-10-11 23:37:14 ~ use a lip scrub 
~ brush your lips with a toothbrush 
~ do a lip mask 
~ use chapstick / lip balm 
~ use Vaseline

200 2018-10-11 23:37:06 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
201 2018-10-11 23:36:54 There’s a $20 and an oil cartirage in there too
202 2018-10-11 23:36:53 โห ดูตาแฉะ ขอบคุณจ้า 
203 2018-10-11 23:36:45 Canadian oil garage-sale.  I'm putting my barrels out on the lawn tomorrow.  Western Canadian Select crashed today from USD $26 a barrel to $21.  To put that in perspective WTI is at $71.  Same fucking oil - just a little further away.  This is depression-era price action.
204 2018-10-11 23:36:43 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
205 2018-10-11 23:36:41 I have visions of it being submerged in a vat of oil and then dripping when it is brought out gouging with globules of oil ( like a lava lamp ) then I get shivers thinking about it  I know to much clean eating and salads here in Australia 
206 2018-10-11 23:36:23 To plump up lips, apply peppermint oil.
207 2018-10-11 23:36:23 I feel so fucking good right now, I made my bath purple, put in extra bubbles, lit some candles, lit a blunt, turned on some dream pop, did a face mask, shaved all the places I needed to shave, and when I’m done I’m putting on oil and nail polish 
208 2018-10-11 23:36:15 Once the Oil runs out they will most likely look like Syria, as they are hotbeds for terrorism
209 2018-10-11 23:36:09 Xmas Eve dinner for 15. Prime rib and Yorkshire puddings. Oil from the puddings had dripped onto the oven bottom undetected. Molten chocolate cakes went in to bake for dessert. 



They were inedible with the fire extinguisher stuff all over them.
210 2018-10-11 23:36:06 Marinate thin sliced meat for 24 hours in 1/2 cup soy, splash fish sauce, 3+ crushed garlic cloves, TB sesame oil, 1 inch grated ginger, tsp brown sugar, tsp rice wine vinegar. Grill and serve over rice with fresh or steamed veggies and kimchi
211 2018-10-11 23:35:42 What chance that Canada gets its oil and gas shit together? A country that values peace, order & good govt above life, liberty & pursuit of happiness, can't supply its eastern population centers with its own oil and gas from AB and BC? I love 'em but really...
212 2018-10-11 23:35:41 i remember i tried to be cheap and let somebody do my brakes and oil change. i swearrrrr the man wires my brakes to my horn so every time i braked my car would whistle

214 2018-10-11 23:35:13 Both Bushes were dirty with Saudi oil, and Tillerson was too. But they all knew one thing: Once you're in the WH, you have to keep at least the perception of distance. Jared and Trump went all in, taking their bribes thinking they could do so with impunity. They are beyond F**ked

217 2018-10-11 23:34:30 the Saudi Arabia is a deep deep rabbit hole.
Oil deals in Russia,...back channels in Seychelles,.....laundered money going in and out of exposed accounts,...influence peddling, corrupt appointees and Secretaries-
Cabinet. Voter suppression-Gerrymandering, Murder, lies,torture.
218 2018-10-11 23:34:24 เราแฟนปัจจุบันต้องหนักแน่นนะน้องออย
219 2018-10-11 23:34:23 You need to have your mouth washed out with soap.  Or motor oil.
220 2018-10-11 23:34:21 And what an engine AI can be! However, the internal combustion engine in my (hypothetical) car runs a lot better on gasoline than crude oil. This metaphor holds true in ML, as well. Or so I’m told—I borrowed the gasoline metaphor from @charleskfisher 
221 2018-10-11 23:34:06 I have to find someone to do my oil change this weekend because it’s giving me anxiety every time I see that warning 
222 2018-10-11 23:33:58 they don’t have pesto silly just tomato, alfredo and olive oil !!
223 2018-10-11 23:33:56 Aviso aos amigos: além de Roger Waters, coloca nesse mesmo rolê aí:

Rage Against the Machine, Bad Religion, Rise Against, Dead Kennedys, Green Day, Public Enemy, System of a Down, midnight Oil, Sex Pistols, U2, NOFX, Marilyn Manson, Pearl Jam, Bad Brains, The Germs, Bod Dylan, +

226 2018-10-11 23:33:49 Ced gave a personal testimony about using CBD on the breakfast club that oil & cream is BOMB!!
227 2018-10-11 23:33:46 I got mine today at the minute clinic since my strep test was negative and I didn’t have a fever. Also, wtf is thieves oil???
228 2018-10-11 23:33:31 I feel you! Try lavender oil! I used it all the time. I get real bad anxiety when driving in heavy traffic or driving somewhere new and I keep some in my car!
229 2018-10-11 23:33:23 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
230 2018-10-11 23:33:17 Public Citizen: While the media obsesses over Kanye’s rant in the Oval Office, the Senate just quietly confirmed a climate change skeptic and former attorney of oil giant BP to lead the Department of Justice’s environment division. [t]
231 2018-10-11 23:33:03 @dpradhanbjp sir namaste sir  why oil PSU are not opening vacancy for iti
232 2018-10-11 23:32:58 Tired of going to get your oil changed and all of a sudden your car needs a new transmission and blinker fluid, and you have no idea that blinker fluid doesn’t even exist??? #MechanicsWithMajazz coming soon

233 2018-10-11 23:32:55 I would say fish oil is really good to take daily a lot of good benefits
234 2018-10-11 23:32:37 Midnight oil
235 2018-10-11 23:32:26 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
236 2018-10-11 23:32:19 I’m guessing it’s not oil that you anoint with?
237 2018-10-11 23:32:14 I could use an oil refill! lol  My scent is finally getting to the end. Wish they had a sale again!
238 2018-10-11 23:32:08 How about not taking oil money or fawning over the House of Saud?
239 2018-10-11 23:32:07 I’m in favour of the pipeline but it better be bloody bomb proof and at the same time continue to support the science of improving better extraction methods for oil and gas.
Support technology to reduce the noise that’s created by watercraft.
240 2018-10-11 23:31:51 The speech the snp made about oil revenue needs re-playing?
241 2018-10-11 23:31:44 ExxonMobil will commit $1 million throughout 2 years to promote a tax on carbon emissions following the UN stating we have 12 years to significantly curb global warming. This is rare for an oil company to commit to this. #SUACCF18
242 2018-10-11 23:31:26 If you're along Ngong road between city mortuary and Adams arcade, stay vigilant. A friend just called me moments ago that police have arrested some men in a TZ vehicle with firearms and bomb materials at Oil Libya. Two men are said to have escaped.
243 2018-10-11 23:31:25 We could have easily been the leaders of renewable energy and not dependent on fossil fuel sources. We could’ve told countries like Saudi Arabia to go fuck themselves. But... since Big Oil made the GOP its bitches, we have to let China and others lead the way.
244 2018-10-11 23:31:05 Russia doesn’t believe it could be stopped economically, so do I. Especially with that load of oil, gas, uranium, metals etc etc and with China not supporting any sanctions. The last time it was stopped only thanks to pure luck, the right man was at the right place.
245 2018-10-11 23:31:02 Oil??
246 2018-10-11 23:30:59 I got my flu shot yesterday. Do you have thieves oil??
247 2018-10-11 23:30:51 How is that relevant to your suggestion that they are not promoting oil? 

Again, Record. High. Oil. Production
248 2018-10-11 23:30:51 I gotta. WASH. this POT. of OIL.
249 2018-10-11 23:30:48 Our generation with vaping and thc oil being turn into those pins we won’t know what that will do to our bodies till we’re 60

253 2018-10-11 23:30:24 Not to pile on but how about the 1,220,000,000 Canada spends to ship in Saudi Oil
254 2018-10-11 23:30:24 Or better still, fry the hen in mamador oil..since it's the mother-in-law that tied the womb.
255 2018-10-11 23:30:21 Hi good news I met a puppy today while getting an oil change. His name is Monty and he is a 7 week old pitbull, chocolate coat, bright blue eyes, aspiring mechanic and I love him with my whole heart. Thanks for your time.
256 2018-10-11 23:30:14 If I didn’t need an oil change so bad I would be getting a milk shake from Steak ‘n Shake RIGHT NOW
257 2018-10-11 23:30:13 蟹の形のことを思い出して気持ち悪くなると同時にあれのなにがムカつくかを言語化し終えた
258 2018-10-11 23:30:07 @WWE How long are you gonna spit lies about Saudi being progressive? How long is that oil money going to compromise  your morals? I have since cancelled my sub to the network, but since this news about the journalist, I wont even consider watching on pirated platforms. Disgusting
259 2018-10-11 23:30:04 Michael Eric Tyson speaks the truth..Kanye West is being taken for a ride by a snake oil con man..sad..
260 2018-10-11 23:30:02 This is for real guys. Your dealing with hot oil, this is not a joke. Making fried chicken is very dangerous. Hot oil is very dangerous. If you guys wanna die that’s on you. If you want fried chicken suicide you go ahead.   -me to my family while cooking dinner
261 2018-10-11 23:30:02 CCI Canadian Crude Index close for Oct 11th $29.24 US/bbl -$1.60 -6.43% #CCI #CanadianCrudeOil #CDNCRUDE #Oil #CCXETF $USO $DBO $OIL $UCCO
262 2018-10-11 23:29:57 Oil paint containers...for when you just spent 45 mins mixing colors to get the right shade of green.
263 2018-10-11 23:29:38 alternate universe where the ottoman empire still existed and fully controlled the gulf and they used that oil wealth to enrich the worthwhile parts of the muslim world and the bedouins were still living in tents 
264 2018-10-11 23:29:16 So. Less than 24 hours into trying the CBD oil & terpenes I suggested... my friend just called to say it's a Miracle!  Said he hasn't had this much energy and pain relief in YEARS! He can't stop speaking the praise to all who will listen.  It's good to be part of that. 
265 2018-10-11 23:28:58 Waited last minute to get an oil change but at least I’m doing it ok
266 2018-10-11 23:28:53 Coughing? Vicks or said Olbas Oil on the soles of your feet. 
267 2018-10-11 23:28:49 The fundamentals matter and timelines too.

So start with the Sun.  Then think how Gold is created, then think how oil is created, then think how GDP is maintained, then think about how these things have and are manipulated.  Then think of time lag, waste and abuse.


268 2018-10-11 23:28:46 I underestimated the chile oil at school and now my mouth is on 
269 2018-10-11 23:28:35 I’ve used lotion as lipgloss, lipgloss as lotion, hair spray as body oil lmaooooo

273 2018-10-11 23:28:25 They will drill till the last drop of oil. Even if the world is colapsing. Buy Teslas and other EV and get power over the corporations and their profits!
274 2018-10-11 23:28:18 I prefer getting all my fat from nutrient-sense "real" food. Butter is better than more heavily processed oil but the best fat is the one normally found in foods (meat, nuts, fish, eggs, etc.).
275 2018-10-11 23:28:05 If Saudi Arabia had no oil, would we be sucking up to them at all?
276 2018-10-11 23:27:54 Got too excited dashing peppermint oil over the whole yard to scare a couple spiders, and now every breath I take is a minty punch to my throat
277 2018-10-11 23:27:48 Trying to keep it out of the gutter but when there's a perfect rack my ball just loves sliding through the oil into it. #bowlingpuns

279 2018-10-11 23:27:41 US indeed has more oil than it can use so exports will continue to grow but the recent sharp jump in freight has increased cost of the oil for Asian buyers. Something has to give - either wider discounts or more oil to Europe?
280 2018-10-11 23:27:30 3 days of work on my motorcycle and I finished...my body is soaked in oil, gasoline, and grime. If you need me I'll be soaking in a hot bath till monday 
281 2018-10-11 23:27:23 I'm curious, if a person used cannabis oil without THC for medical reasons. Obviously there's no high involved, but would that still be considered "impaired"? Thanks

u won’t tho
284 2018-10-11 23:27:08 Oil down, dollar down & gold up. When oil was high days ago, gold was (inexplicably) down. If US wants $ down, they must bring down $ oil price, killing shale viability. My #OilStandard thesis is If China cuts bid in $ priced oil (probably begun), they'll bring $ down with it.
285 2018-10-11 23:26:56 What if you are something disgusting and healthy? Like fish oil?

292 2018-10-11 23:26:06 Let's talk about property rights. Building a oil pipeline is more important than the property rights of Native Americans. That is what your party firmly believes.

294 2018-10-11 23:25:46 Governments create the economic playing field in which big oil make strategic decisions about how to pitch and how wild to swing. But equally big oil know the writings on the wall with legacy business models and we need some forward thinking leadership.

296 2018-10-11 23:25:26 Trump & the Saudis? Something stinks. Lets not forget most all the 9-11 terrorists came from there. They will do anything to keep the world dependent on Oil. I really don't trust that repressive regime. Trump has business & praise for them. Criminal activities?
297 2018-10-11 23:25:22 I think you meant to say “responsible” pro oil/gas development.
298 2018-10-11 23:25:20 BTW. I’ve worked in the oil and gas industry for 21 years. Specifically, in Production Enhancement or Frac. There is no “K” in Frac (short for fracturing). They got that one detail wrong. I’ll still see you there Grrrr (again). See you buddy.
299 2018-10-11 23:25:05 With 83% going to the top 5%. So with minimal gains for many, the increase in gas prices ( Iranian oil not available ), tariffs on imports and increasing interest rates most really didn't get meaningful tax cuts.

301 2018-10-11 23:24:29 all of this Trumpian kerfuffle is distraction,...pure and simple. Reporters,writers,bloggers feel the obligation to report on it, bc that's their job.
Saudi Arabia will be exposed via Mueller over oil deal in Artic-Russia thru Tillerson.
they'll be plenty to report on soon,...

310 2018-10-11 23:23:38 Big oil, big food, big pharma, etc. are all in cahoots to drug and/or kill humanity, pollute the environment, & destroy the planet, all in the name of turning huge profits and realizing the power it brings. The insanity is that they’re too greedy to care that they will die too.

313 2018-10-11 23:23:00 @drmikehart how effective is cdb oil for anxiety and is there a form of it that is preferred for anxiety?
314 2018-10-11 23:22:53 I think we should stop dumping oil into the US for hugely discounted prices.
315 2018-10-11 23:22:48 new oil fields discovered and price per barrel up again but then we were told the oil would run out in 30 years, 40 years ago.

320 2018-10-11 23:22:15 WTF has Ash Wednesday got to do with it? The article doesn't say bush fires just started happening recently DER?!?! They have increased in numbers. What is it about pollution, wars for oil, drastic heatwaves
 that you like?
321 2018-10-11 23:22:13 North Sea oil was always seen as a convenient cash-cow for the Treasury and a forward thinking Chancellor would have invested some of the proceeds in a Wealth Fund for the Nation.

325 2018-10-11 23:21:42 Thanks to @realDonaldTrump for the embargo on Iranian oil. This will be like an #EV tax credit as gas goes up and people turn to new, incredible #evs. Maybe big D does believes in climate science.

328 2018-10-11 23:21:22 Mind-boggling that the media doesn't care or cover the war in Yemen, perpetrated in part by American weapons. I guess selling arms in exchange for oil money will do that.

334 2018-10-11 23:19:57 First, condolences for your father. Second, I have heard that if you dig down into the sand in places such as Destin you’ll find a layer of oil and Corexit. Thank you BP.
335 2018-10-11 23:19:54 Your next argument is likely to be that preventative care reduces catastrophic costs, so it should be covered. But the same is true in car insurance yet they don't cover oil changes.
336 2018-10-11 23:19:41 Correct. All you asking for by voting yes is to transfer local government tax dollars (which you pay) to oil and gas and other commercial interests for laws such as setbacks, development standards, or environmental regulations.

340 2018-10-11 23:19:02 Nope... you need enough energy, Fish is gives very little energy(oil).
341 2018-10-11 23:19:01 The US has too often turned a blind eye to the crimes of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Before it was for oil supplies, now it's for money. Arms sales will continue regardless of the outcome of any optical investigation.

If you care about environmental issues, you need to pay attention to what the Dept of the Interior is proposing. 

They want to destroy records covering oil & gas leases, mining, offshore drilling,

349 2018-10-11 23:17:55 They also have a good government which is pro oil/gas development - 
Unlike Canada
350 2018-10-11 23:17:50 I’ve literally been trying to turn people on to politics for years now. Our government does not give a shit about climate change because A LOT of them are beholden to...... OIL COMPANIES. Even if we “wake up” we have to get politicians elected that represent ppl not Corporations.
351 2018-10-11 23:17:43 I still remember when a friend suggested I check out "these comics about history made by this girl who like, lives on an oil rig in the Canadian wilderness." Good job getting out of there! It did not seem fun, though you did make some great comics out of it!
352 2018-10-11 23:17:41 the top 70 contributors are specifically coal and oil refineries
353 2018-10-11 23:17:34 It is believed that we won’t be able to reverse climate change or have salt water fish in the sea by 2030 (only 12 yrs). There is a war on drugs, oil, people of color and women and people STILL don’t wanna hear me say “I don’t wanna bring kids into this world”
354 2018-10-11 23:17:15 The bread was stale, yes. I didn’t get any fries. The nuggets were way too salty and left in the oil too long.

412 2018-10-11 23:10:33 So one truck is fixed, the car is in the shop and now my daily truck is leaking oil  like really?  WTF!!

416 2018-10-11 23:10:01 There are far more real ministers that r worthy n deserving of a platform 4 their opinions but yet, MSM hypes this snake oil!
417 2018-10-11 23:09:56 Is that oil
418 2018-10-11 23:09:54 also declining oil prices wrecked the country's export economy and US backed sanctions make it extremely hard to get staple goods into the country.

420 2018-10-11 23:09:47 Oh, Basta Boy.

You decided to dip your #CreepyPornLawyer toe, into TX politics, the Best State in our Republic? 

I hope you're ready for the #RedWaveRising2018 & TEXAS sized, Twitter beat down headed your way.

We don't ooze it, Slick.

421 2018-10-11 23:09:44 Because it's one of those things that 1. Has multiple good answers and 2. Has a bunch of shitheads that are involved.  

Tat works like a pistol. Keep it clean and lubricated with any decent oil/ointment and its going to be fine.

430 2018-10-11 23:08:25 The amendment 74 ballot language was carefully drafted by oil and gas interests to convey precisely this idea. But the takings of the 5th amendment already covers loss of use by government action, regulatory or physical occupation. All this does is create a new right of action.

438 2018-10-11 23:07:35 Which the common Filipino will not feel because of the rising costs of food, transpo, electricity etc. You are imposing new taxes on oil, coal, pvt schools & books! The min wage earner no longer paid income tax when you implemented the train law.These increases are burdening them
439 2018-10-11 23:07:31 Usually a crapload of oil money has that effect.
440 2018-10-11 23:07:21 The local beauty supply store should have it. It’s usually by the tea tree oil and stuff

442 2018-10-11 23:07:10 The Fed interest rates really have been small and inflation is very low. The economy is doing very well. USA is producing more of its own energy and we are not as dependent upon foreign oil. The market will recover. I am bullish.
443 2018-10-11 23:07:02 うーーー
444 2018-10-11 23:06:59 Point. To me, American cheese product tastes like used motor oil
445 2018-10-11 23:06:58 Yup. I just picked up some jasmine oil, figuring that was a safe bet.
446 2018-10-11 23:06:49 Yes. @TheEconomist is prone to this kind of hype as well. Data is a resource. But it is not oil. It is not a flammable fossil fuel that drives modern society. #AI is not an engine. These are metaphors and they are used here to create the picture of something highly potent.
447 2018-10-11 23:06:46 it's a good point, God only knows what that means! In theory it's possible, but its a carbon tax of 100s of euro on oil, and it leaves coal and peat untouched. It's basically nonsense I'd say....

452 2018-10-11 23:06:30 You know that oversized classrooms goes back decades right? The andp hired thousands of teachers, building new schools & problem still persists. I think it'd take a lot of money to fix that's not really available given low oil revenue Opioid is problem nationwide & they've acted
453 2018-10-11 23:06:24 Hmm do we blame Big Oil or the gays?
454 2018-10-11 23:06:16 Like an oil change
455 2018-10-11 23:06:07 Well, they have all our oil, so, no.
456 2018-10-11 23:05:43 Well....we both like OIL!
457 2018-10-11 23:05:41 Damn, that sucks. If it’s any consolation, our olives are going to a bulk producer this year as we’ve been hit by drought [again], and the quality IMO is not worth making a house oil.
458 2018-10-11 23:05:31 As someone who spent the first 58 years of his life in Southern California, and now lives in Dallas, I can only say:

462 2018-10-11 23:05:21 Whoops! I thought he got an oil change for all the cars; he just had the tires rotated. And the check oil light just came on at the start of a long trip. (& the unspoken thing is that it’s somehow my fault.)
463 2018-10-11 23:05:15 holy hell im in immense pain. i dropped an egg shell into my wok and i tried grabbing it with my bare hands. and right as i reached for it. the oil and the egg like just exploded onto my hand. and i know i’m stupid.
464 2018-10-11 23:05:13 He has too, otherwise he'll loose his oil well and money tree and his closest and most loyal ally in the Middle East. The US/Saudi friendship goes way back and will not be broken. It wouldn't surprise if we later found out that US intelligences helped Saudis in assassinating him.

467 2018-10-11 23:04:27 A smart commenter wrote Trump's framing is like his "take the oil" catchphrase - basically an admiring re-appropriation of an old leftist critique of US policy (no blood for oil). A strange tic to assimilate the left critique but then play the heel. Bet other examples exist...

472 2018-10-11 23:03:43 Yes however the farm bailouts are in part is not working, farming are fixtured to have a certain amount to help them through a changing weather, oil depletion-demands inflation high oil price to shoot up interest from imports, American must become a oil producing exporting nation
473 2018-10-11 23:03:41 CBD oil, you can legally get it from Hemp in Great Junction Street in Leith. Works great for back pain.  
474 2018-10-11 23:03:37 @realDonaldTrump On November 4, according to the plan, Swift should stop his services to Iran. The sanctions on oil are not exempted at all, and everyone, including China and India, must cut off their oil completely until November 4th.
475 2018-10-11 23:03:32 The schedule adjustments are to allow equipment to operate and clean the leaf oil off the rails between trains.

484 2018-10-11 23:02:33 My skin can take the oil straight but some people’s skin can’t. If the oil doesn’t work for your skin directly, try diluting it with water or diffusing it instead. It works like magic for me

510 2018-10-11 23:00:12 There’s honestly no way around it. Lol. I struggle with that all the time. Just apply a little oil wrap it and pray for the best the next day. I try not to put heat back in it until I want to curl it or something. Which is usually a week and a half later.
511 2018-10-11 23:00:05 Yes ma'am! Slice them (russet or red) up wedge style, baste with olive oil and coat with seasoned salt. About 8-9 minutes with the lid closed. Delicious and easy.

518 2018-10-11 22:59:28 Be careful with the testosterone. They want to give you something to offset any anger issues that will effect you in other ways. It's a vicious circle. 

Lift weights instead. Use CBD oil.

538 2018-10-11 22:57:48 When you leave Scotland, & see the world minus the UK media filters, it's clear Scotland can be a successful independent country. Bigger geographically than Belgium or Switzerland, population size similar to Norway, & with oil. Scotland can escape Brexit & should.
539 2018-10-11 22:57:44 High oil prices hurts emerging markets, that’s alll I’m saying.

543 2018-10-11 22:57:17 Carbon and oil are visible. People like to use that. It‘s like a toy or joke, sometimes makabre or deadly for people, who hand it out and handle with nuclear energy, is my impression.
544 2018-10-11 22:57:13 Right!  But that's no longer as directly urgent to US, since more exports go east to Asia - though it's very-salient in a variety of indirect ways, including weapons sales, mountain of oil wealth belonging to whoever's in power & whoever they fund, risk of global recession &c...

553 2018-10-11 22:55:54 Home heating oil is going to be a bitch to pay for.
554 2018-10-11 22:55:27 It’s some oil from Walmart.. that was helpful but mostly just been washing and taking care it.. keeping heat out and more protective styles.
555 2018-10-11 22:55:21 Russia is a carbon based economy. Without oil & gas, what else do they have?
556 2018-10-11 22:55:21 Se me cae el vape pen del bolsillo y se me rompe el oil cartridge nuevo, de anoche...respira Saiska Taisha, respira.
557 2018-10-11 22:55:20 olive oil and chili / smoked paprika powder
558 2018-10-11 22:55:16 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
559 2018-10-11 22:55:12 Tomato and mozzarella, with lashings of good olive oil and w/wine vinegar. As a topping olives and avocado pear
560 2018-10-11 22:55:10 Since, we neither fully fund education or the NHS, let's match German Spend on Health, and Finnish Spend on Education.

That, may mean no longer sending Oil Revenue to London.
561 2018-10-11 22:54:50 Good riddance North Sea oil and gas then you short-sighted lunatic. And goodbye Union Jack, goodbye United Kingdom and goodbye UN Security Council seat. Not to mention all the other Brexit garbage.
562 2018-10-11 22:54:43 The @GOP  will@always be climate change deniers, no money in climate change , no off shore drilling, fracking, leaving the Paris climate agreement. Omg where would the @GOP get money from . Oil companies factories that spew out poison
563 2018-10-11 22:54:24 In the week of the warning of the consequences of global warming you lot decide to ramp up fracking and help the oil industry... you really have no fucking idea do you
564 2018-10-11 22:54:12 But don't you think terms of trade are important in assessing fundamental value of a currency.  The increase in oil prices relative to manufactured goods may be what is happening.  And if one can exclude oil imports, why didn't you do that for Turkey, for example?
565 2018-10-11 22:54:09 With all the negativity circulating Oil country after the loss to NJ, which by the way was game 1 in an 82 game season, I just had to throw this out there. Damn am I ever thankful Connor McDavid is an Oiler!!!! Ya’ll need to take a breath and be thankful!!
566 2018-10-11 22:54:08 So, l just had a deep tissue massage in my living room...way to take a lunch break! Also, it’s the first time l ever got a massage with CBD oil (No, it doesn’t make you high)! Back to my scheduled business calls
567 2018-10-11 22:54:06 Mix in eight ounces of olive oil and put back on heat.
568 2018-10-11 22:54:02 Got me an oil change finally 
569 2018-10-11 22:53:45 Not without Scotland it won't. You try and underwrite your national debt without oil.
570 2018-10-11 22:53:43 There are three seasons:

Coconut oil
Coconut gel
Coconut solid

Sincerely, the physics of greatness
571 2018-10-11 22:53:22 Interesting energy news for the day:  The world uses about 21 terawatts of power each year; expressed in terms of oil, this is equivalent to burning through all of Russia’s proven reserves in 12 months.
572 2018-10-11 22:53:19 Tell us about Norway's pipelines  And the Mongstad port which is one of the largest oil & gas ports in all of Europe.
573 2018-10-11 22:53:16 When big oil wins, all the conspiracy freak fascists currently supporting them will be rendered into "carbon neutral" fuel just like the rest of us

The truly rich, however, will spend generations in their bunkers, inbreeding until they can't maintain their machinery anymore
574 2018-10-11 22:53:12 ehh that’s true i burn so easy but instead of putting more sun cream on i put oil on
575 2018-10-11 22:53:03 Also, every time I search for CBD oil for dogs, all that I’ve really seen is hemp oil. Admittedly, I don’t know that much about it or what the difference is.
576 2018-10-11 22:53:03 So ducking impressed with teatree oil. Like W O W
577 2018-10-11 22:52:30 Where there's a will there's a way... was three times the charm with oil prices..
578 2018-10-11 22:52:21 THC oil is used with modified vape pens. So they say in the back pews.
579 2018-10-11 22:52:16 & has been more than 30 years in the oil and gas industry...
580 2018-10-11 22:52:16 Prevention with orange oil and education to neighbors is best; then seeking out less toxic pest control; jumping straight to gas/fumigation is overkill in most situations. Altriset or Termidor drilled into house perimeter for subterranean termites.
581 2018-10-11 22:52:07 Anyone local have the Young Living Essential Oil, RC?
582 2018-10-11 22:51:51 Although breaded the same, the strips are fried in the same oil as the spicy sandwich while the nuggets are fried in the traditional peanut oil. I like the little extra flavor the spicy oil gives! #IncaseYouWereWondering

584 2018-10-11 22:51:39 I love #bloodoranges.
I still have to use that blood orange infused olive oil i got from my cousin! Enjoy the wine Dave
585 2018-10-11 22:51:38 There we go, new tires last month, changed the oil today, put the sand bags in the bed, cleaned the windows, Lady Brett is ready to drive to Grand Forks in the morning!
586 2018-10-11 22:51:32 It didn’t break it down, hemp oil was just listed. i’ve been afraid to try it.
587 2018-10-11 22:51:31 Placebo effect is a very real thing and sometimes it's hard to know if that's why something is working for you. But I could swear that since I've started using lavender essential oil in my diffuser, I feel so much more relaxed while I sit and work. A big difference. #Aromatherapy
588 2018-10-11 22:51:28 Yeah stop drilling for oil.
589 2018-10-11 22:51:19 Other then olive oil, is there any oil that isn't bad ?
590 2018-10-11 22:51:09 Yeah I agree. Also, the traditional left critique of the US-KSA relationship has always been much much more about oil than arms sales.
591 2018-10-11 22:50:48 We send £54b to Westminster and get £30b back. Then Westminster spends umpteen billions on our behalf on nuclear weapon and fancy public works like HS2 which we don't want and charges debt interest we never would have accrued due to £500b of oil we've given to the UK. Great deal!
592 2018-10-11 22:50:43 oof my dad brought my car to get an oil change,tires rotated, new spark plugs, AND filled up my tank  #blessup #dadsfavorite
593 2018-10-11 22:50:31 Can't do tapenade. Won't eat them solo or on anything or anything they are baked in. But olive oil is FANTASTIC so that's how they escaped my "vaporize off the planet" list.
594 2018-10-11 22:50:27 I know the CBD oil is supposed to help fibromialgia sufferers and honestly I would like to be able to try it, anything that can take away my pain is welcome
595 2018-10-11 22:50:20 Reminds me that i used to have a 14 foot light pole mounted to a rotted out and oil burning 90' Dakota with harbor frieght hydraulic jack and winch, for such shenanigans without money

untill the truck bent in half
596 2018-10-11 22:50:17 I would honestly say to you that there are only so many things you can blame on the administration. Rising cost per barrel of oil, and as follows, rising cost to transport goods, cause price variations. Better economy doesn't mean life is easy mode automatically, it'll get better

598 2018-10-11 22:50:05 Probably @POTUS wants to milk more #CrownPrince #KSA and apply more pressure for more oil production and cheaper price.
599 2018-10-11 22:50:02 So if we have a stable business environment, it will attract more FDI and that will give us surplus in dollars since oil price is close to $100 and more dollars will mean more supply than demand and then crash dollars. Correct me if I’m wrong
600 2018-10-11 22:49:53 Yes. Ban all oil products from CA.
601 2018-10-11 22:49:41 Your boy Trudeau still buys oil from KSA and sells weapons to them. Stop acting as if you're not complicit.
602 2018-10-11 22:49:36 Isn’t a private company in those areas a nice word for oil manufacturers that abuse their workers?

611 2018-10-11 22:49:01 Cheap Oil is the prime focus and sadly not a new development
612 2018-10-11 22:48:56 Getting your oil changed makes you feel like you’re driving a new lambo

Now I get to take meds for the Triglycerides and burp up fish oil.
Sweet!
615 2018-10-11 22:48:38 ALZ has ‘spread’ similar to that of a viral infection.  Could be anything - from infected dental procedures to airborne infections.  Interesting that coconut oil’s antifungal/viral/bacterial properties are reported to reverse some of the symptoms.  Silly to overlook.
616 2018-10-11 22:48:36 Surely you're not saying the oil rigs have anything to do with warmer waters
617 2018-10-11 22:48:33 ?? Oil is at 80 dlr should be 45
618 2018-10-11 22:48:30 Yup...Cedar. Way easier. And, according to the reviews, very effective. After some time you have to freshen the cedar with cedar oil. but everyone seems to think that's easy enough. :-)

622 2018-10-11 22:48:12 Crank up more oil fields in U.S. and bankrupt them l
623 2018-10-11 22:48:10 Dollar went up from $1 to 180 Naira in 2015 to $1 to360 now because of unguarded utterances and unpredictable business environment + low oil price, which reduced the dollars in circulation and supply and demand. When you have less dollars it goes up.
624 2018-10-11 22:48:10 That is what happens when you give corporations monopoly over your oil. The feds tried to force oil east in the 60s, 70's and in the 80s but Alberta threw a hairy fit every time and they wanted to send it to the US instead.

Womp womp
625 2018-10-11 22:48:00 They aren't doing well. If there is fallout in big social media socks it will hit the market like the oil embargo in the 70s.
626 2018-10-11 22:47:49 Oh pat, you made a grave mistake, Freddie’s on 31st and union much better, they change the frying oil frequently unlike ricos...
627 2018-10-11 22:47:48 June 2014 to December 2014, (6 months) the price of oil dropped 56%.

April 2014 to September 2014 (5 months) the price per ton of corn in the US dropped 27%.

December 2015 to July 2016 (7 months) the price of gold rose 24%.

Market based commodities prices fluctuate, so?
628 2018-10-11 22:47:35 *Of course* arms sales a key part of the relationship (along with the oil $ that bought them).  Just not the *only* part, or a blank check for murder in the way Trump describes.

630 2018-10-11 22:47:27 Tapenade is the ONLY way I will eat olives; don't like them in martinis or on their own. Otherwise each and every one gets picked off, given away. Olive oil, of course, is great.
631 2018-10-11 22:47:22 Things not to do:
1) Get 200 cement trucks to poor their entire loads simultaneously on the biggest major road arteries in the country.
2) get 100 40 gallon oil barrels full of lsd and dump them in the major cities water reservoirs,
3) Send teams out to steal every manhole cover.
632 2018-10-11 22:47:19 Girls that think drop trucks are ugly are the ones who don’t know how do oil change, or add coolant into there vehicles

636 2018-10-11 22:46:38 And for your info Ansarallah will always be “a thing” since they are a large majority of the population of northern Yemen, so you better be ready for a long fight. Once your oil money runs out what you gonna do? Because there will still be Yemenis to fight you.
637 2018-10-11 22:46:37 International oil companies are just going to walkaway.

639 2018-10-11 22:46:26 I have friends who make big bucks in the oil field. 4 weeks on 2 weeks off. What’s happened to them now tho is their lifestyle now reflects that big money...my question to them is when does it end. They don’t seem to know the answer to that.

649 2018-10-11 22:45:38 I. Do. Not. Care. 

It is all the same crooked oil companies. 

We let them build three pipelines in the last decade and it's never enough for them. They just keep overproducing and trying to ship raw resources as fast as possible stealing wealth from Canada.
650 2018-10-11 22:45:28 Two Old Testament descriptions of Jesus:

A man of sorrows, acquainted with grief . . .
               - and -
Anointed with the oil of joy above his companions.

This is remarkably good news, that both emotions can live within us, both are valid, both experienced by God himself.
651 2018-10-11 22:45:24 Olive oil, rosemary, red bell peppers, salt, pepper, honey, Tennessee honey whiskey.
652 2018-10-11 22:45:12 Yeah - not really. northrop grumman, boeing, lockhead martin, there is no product you can not buy that will impact these business's and that is just from the top of my head. Gas and Oil contracts are done at a geopolitical level, not a consumer level.
653 2018-10-11 22:45:02 Cubium indicts you evil asses and observe the slaughter of your children protecting the oil barons ripping off their families back home. I think Cubic,

655 2018-10-11 22:44:55 But Sturgeon said oil was only a bonus.  Probably just as well because the White Paper estimates were way wide of the mark.
656 2018-10-11 22:44:44 @justinbieber i think you should try castor oil :)
657 2018-10-11 22:44:32 Ok so you agree that it takes many conditions. If some of those conditions are exacerbated by human activity it stands to reason by the very logic that you’ve presented that human activity contributes. 

Stop carrying water for oil companies. You obviously aren’t a total dunce.
658 2018-10-11 22:44:31 Really?, meanwhile Fox News is Trump propaganda tv network spewing hate, division and lies. Trump is a snake oil salesman/ con artist. Kanye need to read books bc his meds have him in a alternate universe. GTFOH

662 2018-10-11 22:44:07 Yeah, that'd help. Gas in Winnipeg went up six cents a litre today because of an explosion in the Maritimes. We don't get our gas from St. John's. Irving Oil has no presence here. I sure as hell didn't any tankers putting newer, more expensive fuel in the holding tanks.
663 2018-10-11 22:44:07 Plus, a decade or so after the war, they proved that there is a shit-ton of oil under the islands.

667 2018-10-11 22:43:43 Fear not, he has no idea what you're talking about. He likes gold bathroom fixtures. Unpeg the dollar as currancy reserve, he thinks it's cash laying around that he can immediately spend buying votes in the "heartland." Think farm bailouts, maybe new oil depletion allowances.
668 2018-10-11 22:43:36 Yes reader, it was ironic. The repetition of the RWNJ talking points from the other "mum" accounts, the oil and gas obsession and the odd stereotyping of imagined female behaviour, all strain credibility. But I guess it keeps you off the street.
669 2018-10-11 22:43:21 I’ve had cbd edibles but I have found the oil has the best effect. Especially if it’s a very sudden panic attack.

678 2018-10-11 22:42:12 To all the keyboard warriors lately thinking it is somehow helpful to tell a random ill person on the internet to “try CBD oil”: No. It is not helpful. Be an actual supportive person instead of another Google university doctor.
679 2018-10-11 22:42:11 This is what happens when you give the US a monopsony over your oil. Not to mention it weakened our NAFTA bargaining position.
680 2018-10-11 22:42:09 Not quite, canola is genetically different from rape to have very low glucosinolates and erucic acid content in the oil. It was originally bred in Canada though.
681 2018-10-11 22:41:07 Does that follow oil prices and employment?
682 2018-10-11 22:40:59 If you were gonna fight for Albertans you'd have ignored the tories, done pharmacare, and nationalized our oil instead of this dumb bailout the federal libs want.

686 2018-10-11 22:40:22 Try cleaning off oil drip marks in a car park? The entire carpark could be empty and your working at the other end? People will try to park right in the very car park you are working on. People behave like magnets. Attracted towards each other. I think they might like your car 2.
687 2018-10-11 22:40:11 Make Big Oil pay for hurricane relief. They suppressed reports of their research scientists' on the probability of climate change so Congress would not impose fuel efficiency standards back in the 70s.
688 2018-10-11 22:40:09 My guess is, if the Saudis weren’t bringing all these billions into the US through arms and oil deals, we’d treat them just like we do Iran.

Silver$14.62+2.05%
Corn$368.75+1.65%
691 2018-10-11 22:40:01 Yeah, close....but, certainly no cigar.
692 2018-10-11 22:39:56 Plus all the $$billions$$ of US war materiel they purchase.
To murder people as they choose.
And Big Oil.
693 2018-10-11 22:39:54 We are drying herbs from our garden and will have spice packets for dipping oil for sale at Fall Festival! (and samples ) Proceeds benefit our Farm2Table efforts.
694 2018-10-11 22:39:51 SO SORRY to hear what he/you are going through. I lost my sweet beloved who also pulled me through a tough time. Cherish your time together and be grateful for him. Hope it improves soon... Try CBD oil. It WORKS on pain.
695 2018-10-11 22:39:49 So mum has just put rapeseed oil in her serum bottle to prank me for always using her skincare cheers mum
696 2018-10-11 22:39:46 So cut Canada’s oil production, quit using anything but renewable resources and now quit eating red meat. Basically they just want half the people in Canada to die and that would save the planet.
697 2018-10-11 22:39:44 I’ve been using magnesium oil for my carpal tunnel and it’s been working SO well
698 2018-10-11 22:39:24 You genuinely believe that a small country of only 5 million that has spewed out copious amounts of oil for over 50 years, worth nearly £500,000,000,000 has required to be subsidised???

Brilliant 
699 2018-10-11 22:39:22 Hope oil may jowa

701 2018-10-11 22:39:08 @LorraineMassey I love the CG method, I’ve been CG for a year. Please could you settle a debate though? Is castor oil CG approved?
702 2018-10-11 22:38:58 Really?

The US subsidizes:

Corn
Wheat
Soybeans
Rice
Beer
Milk
Beef
Peanut Butter
Sunflower Oil

And..

703 2018-10-11 22:38:49 Yes we need more of it please. Especially on oil industry.
704 2018-10-11 22:38:46 It's somewhere between amusing and frustrating to me that one of the solutions to powdery mildew is rosemary oil ... and the plant I have a problem with every year when it comes indoors is in fact my rosemary.
705 2018-10-11 22:38:44 Borges really did something with their garlic flavored oil.
706 2018-10-11 22:38:43 putting poppers in my oil diffuser!
707 2018-10-11 22:38:36 CBD oil will help him relax and with inflammation. Treats are fine but oil straight in the mouth works great.
708 2018-10-11 22:38:30 Oh no you don’t ... ..we don’t want that snake oil salesman
709 2018-10-11 22:38:29 I make my own with coconut oil, baking soda and essential oils!
710 2018-10-11 22:38:21 Quick, y’all give me 3 dietary supplements [other than Black Seed Oil] that are essential for better living.
711 2018-10-11 22:38:15 Not to mention life saving affordable health care for my grandma, and dad. Marijuana legalization in many states under his watch. I can go on.. But Trump has only provided tax cuts for billionaires like the oil company I work for but no one's gotten a raise.
712 2018-10-11 22:38:08 If arm sales (per Trump today) and anything to do with oil is off the table then the Saudis don't really have much to fear. Knowing probably emboldened the Saudis.
713 2018-10-11 22:38:03 Try arnica ointment or Ancient Minerals Magnesium Oil Spray (Amazon). I’m currently experiencing shoulder “something” and the magnesium seems to help. Blessings!
714 2018-10-11 22:37:50 Well that's a selection affect clearly caused by the fact the right wing elites are keeping quiet while holding onto their oil fund investments and the stocks heavily dependent on them. They do of course preach the gospel of  fossil fuels and climate change denial.
715 2018-10-11 22:37:39 Unexpectedly treating my car whenever I go in for an oil change because every damn thing needs to be replaced 
716 2018-10-11 22:37:19 Thank you! Meanwhile mainstream media tunes in to spectacle: Trump's love affair w/Kanye."Stick to Valuble Ideas" says @MichaelEDyson #VoterSuppression, #Racism #ClimateChange Enbridge Pipeline Oil Spill, ND Voter ID law (voter suppression).

Me: This is fine :)

Tuesday: HAVE FUN SPENDING THE DAY IN THE HOSPITAL

Me: All is fine :)

Thursday: an oil change? HOW BOUT YOUR CAR BREAKS DOWN

Me: :) 

In other words i've had a bad week. Please send cat pictures.
719 2018-10-11 22:36:53 My version would have 3 Tablespoons Cold Brew (made with Death Wish Coffee) and 3 tablespoons of melted butter instead of Vegetable Oil.\
720 2018-10-11 22:36:38 Finna get some beard growth oil lbVs 
721 2018-10-11 22:36:29 Plot twist. What if Katz doesn’t want the oil to be successful and the best team remains the 80’s
722 2018-10-11 22:36:26 We get cases at work.  Oil changes litter box you name it 
723 2018-10-11 22:36:16 Maybe they’ll ban him for spreading “fake news.”
724 2018-10-11 22:36:00 Cause my car battery died and it was $130 to get a new one AND I needed an oil change so I had to pay for all that but I only had $100 in my bank account
725 2018-10-11 22:35:41 Ask all those (extremely well paid) members of his "advisory board" members aka PR team who were selling him as a brave visionary/reformer. Ask his shill the "feminist" @lsarsour, too. MBS oil money speaks for them.
726 2018-10-11 22:35:40 Hillary had the same answer when progressives accused her of being funded by the oil industry. Yet they still didnt believe they were individual donations from gas station attendants & rig workers 

Maybe it’s time to consider some progressives intentionally work against progress
727 2018-10-11 22:35:26 kimberly, PLEASE get your oil changed
728 2018-10-11 22:35:17 Also, I didn’t defend Uzi’s violations or say that Uzi didn’t deserve the punishment. But why would I ever want to trust any “statements” from a toxic biased racist Korean streamer who just want to instigate all his fans to harass a pro player and justifies his racism?
729 2018-10-11 22:35:02 Higher rates, higher oil and higher dollar pinching as the flow of #QT ramps up #liquidityrules
730 2018-10-11 22:34:48 That & use of palm oil from non sustainable sources. Hard to boycott Kraft when they have claws into so many areas but can at least boycott Cadbury
731 2018-10-11 22:34:45 Baby oil! Lmao
732 2018-10-11 22:34:39 Climate change is speeding up.  Instead of leading the world in alternative energy, we are pumping out more gas and oil.  I guess you really don’t care about your grandchildren.
733 2018-10-11 22:34:23 Movements that tuck the pelvis under and move the belly toward the spine stretch the lumbar and are great for low back pain. Simplest for humans is lying on back with knees bent pulled up to chest w/ full deep breaths. Also try rubbing cannabis oil on it. GREAT pain relief.
734 2018-10-11 22:34:02 #tytlive One more reason to go all in with green technology...get rid of the only thing sustaining SA economy...the oil. OMG, we truly need the fusion reactor ASAP
735 2018-10-11 22:33:54 Swallow a tablespoon of vegetable oil
736 2018-10-11 22:33:49 Why do you think the foolish virgins don’t have enough oil?
737 2018-10-11 22:33:36 The first Pet cemetery freaked me out!! But I still love the book Eye of the Dragon! My favorite oil of yours @StephenKing ! Not as scary lol
738 2018-10-11 22:33:16 @realDonaldTrump  YES on  112 no FRACKING in any City if its not crude oil its bad oil....RECLAIM PARKS FOR ANIMALS National parks
Bandirtycoalplants ban nuclear power plants  their aging nuclear material anyways.
739 2018-10-11 22:33:15 So my sore throat and spongey ears has now turned into a full on, nose dripping, eye watering cold. The sort where, if you lie down, you can’t breathe; regardless of how much Olbas Oil you smell of.
740 2018-10-11 22:33:12 Turn off Fox News.
Don't forward that Facebook meme.
Find out what the science and data say, rather than listening to the oil company shill.
Read some history.
Believe the victims.
Accept that you might be wrong.
Then take the actions that make things better.
741 2018-10-11 22:32:54 Is coconut oil good for our heart?
742 2018-10-11 22:32:52 The answer is NO. So long as Saudis are serving the interests of big corporations, arms manufacturers and provide cheap supply of oil nothing will change. They may slap their hands and publicly humiliate them but it will only be so that they can extract even more money of Saudis.
743 2018-10-11 22:32:37 If Scots had voted for Independence in 2014 they would now be bankrupt without UK tax receipts and with Oil having been so low for so long due to the glut. Much lower than the breakeven price for North Sea oil.
744 2018-10-11 22:32:25 CBD oil before bed
745 2018-10-11 22:32:20 Slicker than an oil well well well
746 2018-10-11 22:32:16 It’s a combination including fuel (diesel and fuel oil) thermal which kicks into high gear when we have a shortfall in hydropower.
747 2018-10-11 22:32:05 just beard oil. you gotta brush it and youll be good
748 2018-10-11 22:32:01 Try CDB oil! It’s wonderful. Best kinds for my cats have been @pranapet and @CannaCompanion_
749 2018-10-11 22:31:58 After telling myself “ah I do my oil change tomorrow” I finally got it done today 
750 2018-10-11 22:31:50 I don't want the engine oil to smell lovely, I want it to be lubricated (the worst sentence ever).
751 2018-10-11 22:31:47 You have never been to Yorkshire I think the only thing off your list is oil that they don't have. By the way Eccles cakes are from Manchester (Lancashire) and gurning is from Cumbria I'm a Scot  but realistic you obviously know nothing about the rest of the UK
752 2018-10-11 22:31:27 Why haven't YOU met with @realDonaldTrump and explained how cannabis oil saved your life? How about all the individuals suffering mental and physical ailments because you didn't use your bully pulpit to make amends with whom you disagree and deschedule #THC?
753 2018-10-11 22:31:14 Big Oil companies that suppressed their research scientist's reports on the probability of climate change should be taxed to contribute to hurricane relief in every country. #ExxonKnew
754 2018-10-11 22:31:05 How about this.
Let's invade Mexico...kill all the cartels. Make them decide to become American. Then we would have unlimited resources....gas, oil, gems, coal, gold.
Make everyone speak English..!!!!!!

755 2018-10-11 22:30:39 When LL showed up at the VMAs with oil wearing shirts with TVs in them, that was peak 2000s fashion.
756 2018-10-11 22:30:32 Some of the worst deprivation in Western Europe says Fraser nelson.

THINK about that!
WHY do you think that is?
That's YOU c*nts supporting WM screwing Scotland out of her revenues to pay for trident & HS2!

765 2018-10-11 22:29:35 I don't know whether burning biofuels in the existing oil fired plants would help.  It could probably address carbon emission concerns, but there may still be other local pollution impacts, and it's unclear whether we have enough land area for such biofuel production.
766 2018-10-11 22:29:20 Fact: Oil On Water and Lethargy deserved! better!
767 2018-10-11 22:29:20 True, but cannabis oil can reduce pain and suffering in many conditions.
768 2018-10-11 22:29:07 That and chilli oil.

775 2018-10-11 22:28:10 Senate now voting on Michael Juneau to be US District Court Judge for Western Louisiana, approved by Judiciary Cmte on 11-10 party line vote. He worked on civil litigation over the BP Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in 2010.
776 2018-10-11 22:28:08 Saudi Arabia is a religious fundamentalist country hidden behind a smile and a barrel of oil. They provided most of the 9/11 terrorists and the original backer OBL is a Saudi. They repress women and behead criminals in public. Why the hell are we friends with these people?
777 2018-10-11 22:28:01 Our gov'ts can stop subsidies to oil industry.  Let them bear the true cost of their industry.

782 2018-10-11 22:27:35 Distraction technique BS

Over at the Capitol, the Senate just approved a climate change skeptic & former Big Oil att. to lead the DOJ’s enviro division.  

At the same time the current admin is opening up more public lands for resource extraction.  #WeDontTrustYou
783 2018-10-11 22:27:20 Some one working on an oil rig would be happy earning slightly more than someone like you who doesn’t work? Being away from home in a dangerous environment?
784 2018-10-11 22:27:17 Happens to Calgary every oil crash. Check the history as O&G companies layoff workers furthest from the wellhead first. Lots of help wanted signs up in the Edmonton area. Also would have been worst if @jkenney was in power. Layoff health & education workers too. #ableg
785 2018-10-11 22:27:17 Why the hell was a judge with family connections to the oil and gas industry allowed to preside over a fracking case?  This country is seriously going backwards.  Who the HELL do they think they are?  They are on the right track to getting good people angry enough.....
786 2018-10-11 22:27:15 @PnPCBC Saudi Arabia is not an important country and once the turn off the oil taps as they said they will in 20 years, the'll be even less important.

790 2018-10-11 22:26:43 四暗刻さんおはありです！
791 2018-10-11 22:26:43 Yes because of that black eye in Fort Mcmurrey,  We are an energy and natural resource producing Nation.  I'd be more then happy to see all Oil sands production cease. Its barely profitable anyway.
792 2018-10-11 22:26:34 Imagine what would happen if they found oil on mars
793 2018-10-11 22:26:33 Tomato tart. Prep it ahead of time. Fill a pie pan with cherry tomatoes. Mix kanji breadcrumbs w a few tbs of olive oil & spices, layer on top of tomatoes. Bake. Just warm it up the next day.

795 2018-10-11 22:26:28 get healthy oils elsewhere. Those good-for-you omega-3 fatty acids found in fish also come from plant sources. Leafy green vegetables, walnuts, flaxseed oil, soy oil, and canola oil are good options, but your body converts just a small amount to DHA, the type of omega-3 in fish.

800 2018-10-11 22:25:32 Ok so I wanna ask something. 

Is it just me or when you get your monthly visit from mother nature during that week you become extremely unlucky?? 

Example: 

You try to bake a cake which is not your first time doing so and instead of 1cup of veg oil you put 11/4 type of thing?
801 2018-10-11 22:25:25 Why not? It's lotion, oil, pain and health care without getting high.
802 2018-10-11 22:25:19 “This tsunami has been brought to you by BP: we aren’t just oil spills anymore”
803 2018-10-11 22:25:17 What kinda oil did you get??
804 2018-10-11 22:24:54 They are so well educated, they go outside their offices & check out the weather to find out what's happening to the planet.  Then they ask the gas & oil companies what they are allowed to think.
805 2018-10-11 22:24:52 Your stupid bio oil is useless
806 2018-10-11 22:24:50 yesssss I dont do maargarine. its butter or olive oil for me

This is a real story. Believe it or not!
The wife of an incompetent oil pundit had a weird dream in which a lot of men including her husband are being auctioned. 
Pundit: How much was I priced?
Wife: You're bundled with others for sale priced at $1.00 a dozen...
813 2018-10-11 22:23:51 Rosehip oil
814 2018-10-11 22:23:41 Think 20-30 years in the future. US Gulf Coast & Florida/Georgia Atlantic coastline pounded  by huge hurricanes, leaving much of it uninhabitable. Tyndall closed, maybe Kings Bay Georgia where the boomers are. 

Meanwhile, geopolitical foe Russia mining oil in ice-free arctic.
815 2018-10-11 22:23:24 They changed my back light and charged me like $80 for synthetic oil . I feel robbed lol
816 2018-10-11 22:23:21 They DO NOT want to build #TMX. They DO NOT want our oil in the marketplace. They DO NOT give a rat's ass about Alberta & our extraction industry.
817 2018-10-11 22:23:09 Of course it is. Why do you think Syria has been bombed to shit and access from Syria to Golan heights destroyed by Israel, US and UK aerial bombardment? Israel have been operating there for ages already, some very wealthy people have invested in oil drilling there.
818 2018-10-11 22:23:09 Yes. Over production and lack or refineries.

Don't expect me to feel bad for the poor oil companies. They did this to themselves.
819 2018-10-11 22:23:08 Does Yorkshire have oil, salmon, whisky, timber,  water, and world renowned tourist attractions? Best of luck punting your Eccles cakes and gurning tournaments.
820 2018-10-11 22:23:07 Trump:  Oil vs Kashoggi?  Oil vs Kashoggi?  Oil vs Kashoggi?

Oil!
821 2018-10-11 22:22:57 You talk about help? You have only been elected due to the help of your oil baron masters. It’s ironic for someone who supposedly fights for liberty— You have no liberty of your own to vote the way our district deserves. You vote how you are instructed to.
822 2018-10-11 22:22:57 Fr bro lol these people think cause they weld & scaffold at a refineries they’re oil money. They know nothing about real oil drilling money 
823 2018-10-11 22:22:44 3 days of fire protection training complete! I now know all about the NFPA 25 standard and the various fire types, pumps, alarms, and sprinkler systems...& which to use in various oil, gas, and power plant-related operations. 

Maybe it’ll help with @hqtrivia one of these days?
824 2018-10-11 22:22:36 Sometimes you don’t feel like changing your car oil but realize you don’t wanna wait 2hrs for no oil change at a dealership lol
825 2018-10-11 22:22:25 Saudis don't want gas over 3$.  They've publicly admitted this. Their goal is to keep it at exact right amount that won't force people to abandon oil and go full electric. But as a hedge theyre also heavily investing in electric cars too. They ain't dumb. That's for sure.
826 2018-10-11 22:22:15 $$$, oil, arms deal.....
827 2018-10-11 22:22:10 The EU would only accept Scotland in if they handed over the fishing and the oil. Not such a rosy future then
828 2018-10-11 22:22:08 I need my dad back so he can remind me 36 times to get an oil change/check my oil and then get fed up of me putting it off and do it for me lmfao 
829 2018-10-11 22:22:05 Preheat a paste, then squeeze and a bit healthier) in oil in a handful of tin and black pepper.
830 2018-10-11 22:22:01 You coming to Jacksonville and Terra Haute this weekend? I know a little guy that would love and autograph sprint car and I need a T-shirt
831 2018-10-11 22:21:55 Bitcoin, snake oil, elephant skin, whatever
832 2018-10-11 22:21:53 Basically, “I insulted Uzi as a pig, but he totally deserved it. So does every single Chinese.”
833 2018-10-11 22:21:46 Will be less because there are fewer systems, and no oil, or radiator coolant, or tranny fluid to change ever.
834 2018-10-11 22:21:35 Thank you Tom Udall for being on our side in this all important issue.  How ridiculous is it for Trump to think he knows more than 91 scientists?  His problem is gas & oil giants have him by the balls.
835 2018-10-11 22:21:32 What Canada needs is removal of tariffs on pulse exports,  access to a agri market which Andy didn't have the guts to mention as Modi would never agree so he's happy to sell oil , what a looser.
836 2018-10-11 22:21:32 My favorite essential oil? Baking grease.
837 2018-10-11 22:21:23 I don't think any religion/s should be tolerated at schools. The Abrahamic religions have been a cancer on Europe for nearly 2000 years... In 2018 the Church and state should be as separate as oil and water..
838 2018-10-11 22:21:22 Hurricanes r worse EVERY YR. Aside frm. the human misery, they effect the transport, and refinery production of oil The cost to fill ur precious car remains artificially high So r we going to continue to say "the will of God", when its r own fault
839 2018-10-11 22:21:20 So what you’re saying is the oil business is sticking it to Democrats where they live and drive?
840 2018-10-11 22:21:19 The rules of a Nigerian household

841 2018-10-11 22:21:03 We are spending around the same amount on Kipevu oil terminal....maybe @UKenyatta should cancel that
842 2018-10-11 22:20:52 LOL , Oil always win
843 2018-10-11 22:20:47 I know some you girls think you need a man to tell you this but I’ll be that person for you.... go get an oil change.

846 2018-10-11 22:20:32 Why did Atiku go to APC to out state  Goodluck,why is he coming back to plot coup,is it because Nigerians from that region are not good to be president,Let me ask Atiku does he own oil blocks?, does Buhari has one? What does he want to offer that we don't have,
847 2018-10-11 22:20:27 Please explain the subsidies. Make it a detailed break down including import and export revenue. I won't bring oil into it as it only stacks up as 5% of GDP in Scotland. #bbcqt
848 2018-10-11 22:20:16 For long term investors this a win, win, win... or buy, buy, buy! In two days lower 10 year note, lower oil prices, and now a market undervalued! I’ll be buying tomorrow. Factor in Formal EU and Japan deal coming and off to the races
849 2018-10-11 22:20:05 Yep. Many of Dems are also on the fossil fuel take. The smart ones would divest NOW. But the GOP is owned lock stock and oil barrel. They have nowhere to go.
850 2018-10-11 22:19:55 100% correct having an religious ayatollahs in charge of huge oil reserves is not an option.
851 2018-10-11 22:19:47 Oil , fish , wind , tides , world class universities with free education , space for people to come here and work , a govt that supports the NHS and its people ... that’s just for starters
852 2018-10-11 22:19:43 80$ oil change 
853 2018-10-11 22:19:36 Breakfast; fried eggs, onions, olive oil. Try it.
854 2018-10-11 22:19:17 Nothing better than getting your oil changed and having the guy under your vehicle call for the head mechanic to come check something out

862 2018-10-11 22:18:06 Just in time for the holiday season!
In a few short weeks, we're introducing diffusers and our brand of essential oils. The diffuser and oil combination welcomes you into the world of aromatherapy and makes a unique holiday gift.
863 2018-10-11 22:17:56 India's doing a lot with solar.  Why would they swap dependency on foreign coal and oil for dependency on foreign LNG when they have their own sunshine?
864 2018-10-11 22:17:53 Disappearing his critics, women as farm animals, psycho behavior - Sir Richard Branson was not aware of it before? Now the beneficiaries of MBS oil largess suddenly are all "How could he!" while recently selling him as a reformer/visionary. Fucking hypocrites
865 2018-10-11 22:17:30 Ngl my lips were soooo dry one time at my Aunties house I deadass used cooking olive oil. Because boiii
866 2018-10-11 22:17:26 so much money they can always find another family member to wear the crown.

notice the saudis arent allowed to have any real industry.... only oil, hotels, drug money laundering, gambling and cocaine

saudis cant even run a hajj without killing 1000. decadent in the extreme
867 2018-10-11 22:17:01 In the orange Cheetos defense and trust me I don't want to defend this idiot ever, our country has always been over backwards for Saudi Arabia and it comes down to oil! That's the real reason we fight with these Middle Eastern countries to begin with
868 2018-10-11 22:16:56 I just overhead my 1st grader say, after reading the label on a bag of chips, "Dad, I am so glad that these don't have gluten OR canola oil!" And that's when I knew, without a doubt, that I was a new-age mom. #hilarity #parenting #kids #parentlife
869 2018-10-11 22:16:44 U honestly have not spoken like one with knowledge. U have been ranting about PMB. Speak to the issues posed to u. Countries who refine their oil, have long term leaders and manufacture goods were hit by recession due to the fall in oil price. Sincerely, how did u think
870 2018-10-11 22:16:44 With large annual tax increases, giving sanctuary to illegals, free needle exchanges and your buddy Justin killing the oil sands, you really seem to be dropping the ball on that one.
871 2018-10-11 22:16:42 Sign of the season: Try our pumpkin-spice oil change.
872 2018-10-11 22:16:38 俺もよくわかってないから気にしなくていい。w
873 2018-10-11 22:16:32 save yours pumpkin seeds and roast them with olive oil and salt!! 250 degrees for 45 minutes then 325 for 5 minutes! 
874 2018-10-11 22:16:27 been thinking the ocean cargo industry needs you and Tesla’s technology. cargo ships are gross polluters using bunker oil to power. 1 ship per annum = pollutants of 50 million cars.  90,000 ships in operation. help, please.
875 2018-10-11 22:16:25 Yeah all the money is in science not oil! Where are all these rich paid off scientists everyone keeps talking about ?
876 2018-10-11 22:16:21 women really be getting their oil changed once every fuck it whenever
877 2018-10-11 22:16:20 明日は週末明日は週末明日は週末明日は週末…
878 2018-10-11 22:16:16 Ahh I have a friend named Lombardo. She just cleared me up on the difference between italian and Sicilian.. all started over a question I had about cooking pasta and olive oil. 
879 2018-10-11 22:16:15 Find you someone that loves you like Granny loves Jed Clampett. Watch the intro to that show. She was jumping around clapping even before he came into the cabin and told her about the oil. She was just that happy to see him.
880 2018-10-11 22:16:13 @realDonaldTrump The Saudi Arabia deal is a good time to get of the oil market.
881 2018-10-11 22:16:12 In what sense is oil non-rivalrous?
882 2018-10-11 22:16:05 You should really listen to that oval office meeting and see how flipping batshit crazy Kanye West is. Maybe they are just commenting on reality.
883 2018-10-11 22:16:01 Extend that line of logics, COP would still keep Canadian oil sand assets.
884 2018-10-11 22:15:57 Fake news used to promote snake oil.
885 2018-10-11 22:15:54 Between selling arms to Saudi Arabia and Saudi oil replacing Iranian oil, Trump does not give a rat's ass about a journalist who is not a US citizen getting wacked by the Saudis.
886 2018-10-11 22:15:53 — to that. Laughing at myself I went back to work, removing the Poeces one by one. I needed to replace he gasgets, spark plugs and the oil filter too. God only knows the last time it was actually changed. I should beat their asses for abusing this poor truck.)
887 2018-10-11 22:15:52 Via Sierra Club: A company called SAExploration wants to start seismic oil testing in the Arctic Refuge this winter. Please CALL to tell them to back off!
888 2018-10-11 22:15:45 So, you’re using car salesmen to sell yourself? I’m gonna hold out for the oil- I hear it fixes everything ;) (Kidding- sales is hard)

892 2018-10-11 22:15:26 Why does it take so long to get a oil change
893 2018-10-11 22:15:25 Is this where he offloads the CBD oil?
894 2018-10-11 22:15:15 寝てるんだけど脳みそが起きてるみたいな状態が本当の覚醒なんだけどずっと起きてても覚醒してる。
895 2018-10-11 22:15:09 It’s been this realpolitik since the Eisenhower administration. Thing is, we don’t need their oil anymore! Sadly, they’ll find other buyers to keep them afloat and the radical Wahhabists will keep their grip on power.
896 2018-10-11 22:15:04 Oil?
897 2018-10-11 22:15:01 We Do. Yesterday, because they took the oil is all over the Place. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
898 2018-10-11 22:14:54 My fellow Cdns today our WCS oil hit $52 discount. It was sub $20. I was so shocked I thought something was wrong w/ the Bloomberg screen.  How this is not an election issue I don't understand. We r being fleeced, robbed & our leaders are silent.This is bigger crisis than...
899 2018-10-11 22:14:52 And it's a wonderful thing! 
900 2018-10-11 22:14:46 How would Scotland thrive outside of the union, you can’t have an economy based on a limited resource (gas/oil) and whisky #bbcqt
901 2018-10-11 22:14:43 I used to use bay and sage leaves in cupboards to keep bugs out. And I heard lavender oil works for lots of bugs.
902 2018-10-11 22:14:39 thanks! coconut oil has helped some but i need more 
903 2018-10-11 22:14:37 No we are addressing real world market realities that make our oil less desirable and less profitable. Making our greater production of a dirtier oil even more "shameless" as you put it
904 2018-10-11 22:14:28 This is for conservative dumbwitts,. Andy is claiming to sell oil which India desperately needs anyways & we already have a global market.  In return he's promising India God knows what , you can only expect a losing deal from a loser like Andy.
905 2018-10-11 22:14:27 Coconut oil

906 2018-10-11 22:14:26 — pieces apart and started stacking them on the oil pan I’d sat close to catch the nuts and bolts. When the next song came on the radio overhead I grinned. @CravesTheFire would most likely kill me for listening to Aqua but, hello, it’s Barbie Girl. Who can not sing or dance —
907 2018-10-11 22:14:18 Please don't build him up and platform him. He's got enough hate outlets. These pictures with him with tape on his mouth are ridiculous. He's got free speech, that's why we're subjected to his tosh. 
He's a very good marketing professional or snake oil salesman
908 2018-10-11 22:14:17 Well...it is all about big oil with him
909 2018-10-11 22:14:02 The responses to The Hill post are pure comedy. SAD!
910 2018-10-11 22:13:49 Judge Robert Altham, should be investigated for breach of judicial process. His family's association with the oil and gas industry was a definate reason to recuse himself. Not only did he not do that , he imposed the most draconian sentence since 1932.

915 2018-10-11 22:13:31 My sharpei and I are super allergic to pretty much everything, the oil helps to keep them away and it’s not toxic :)
916 2018-10-11 22:13:21 I have heard a lot of good things about the CBD oil. I actually wanted to try it for my dog that has severe allergies, but when we had him tested he was allergic to hemp.

922 2018-10-11 22:12:50 MBS is only an issue because our administration empowered him. There will be a price to pay and it's already begun. Does Trump care? No, right now all he's looking at are arms sales an oil prices. Those things will seem small when it's all over.
923 2018-10-11 22:12:48 Where did it go?  Relocated the boiler from the laundry room to garage. An oil to natural gas conversion of a U.S. Boiler Company K2 condensing boiler and indirect hot water heater in Rockaway, NJ.

926 2018-10-11 22:12:04 That’s nothing compared to oil companies
927 2018-10-11 22:11:52 We should stop importing their oil as well right?

934 2018-10-11 22:11:23 The Kurds were wronged by the Syrian Government and the control over the expression of your heritage and language is reprehensible but the Kurds need to work together with the Syrian Government for there to be peace and stability. Kick the US out and use diplomacy to share oil
935 2018-10-11 22:11:11 Olive oil, salt + pepper
936 2018-10-11 22:10:57 Interesting oil fact.  Venezuela's oil production is now at 1.3 mm bpd.   This back to 1940 levels.  Socialism is regressive it creates despair and poverty.  But some people continue to champion it.
937 2018-10-11 22:10:55 Today, I'm serving up some excessive olive oil realness.

939 2018-10-11 22:10:33 Yes but in the case of  the railway to Alaska it is Canadian oil which will be sold to China and only uses the TAPS pipeline system to send it to Valdez

943 2018-10-11 22:09:51 Why are the people in this Honda place insisting on talking to me, do I look like I can afford to buy a new car? I drove my car and avoided maintenance until it was at 10% oil life fam
944 2018-10-11 22:09:50 @AbroadInJapan I WISH that air-pocket gel-seat cushy-butt device would work for you Chris. They're all snake oil. Smash the onsen and soak them gams!

I'd love to kill myself on a part of that ride with ya. Japan was awesome when I visited!
945 2018-10-11 22:09:47 All these countries are targeted by America so they can maintain oil prices, and keep Israel safe from all the countries they pissed off when they decided to lump themselves back in the middle again ofter hundreds of years.;)you are practicaly voting for your own demise with war
946 2018-10-11 22:09:46 ぬはありです！！！！
947 2018-10-11 22:09:45 Presumably even you concede that petrol is a fossil fuel, despite the fact it is crude oil that comes out of the ground, not four-star?
Equally hydrogen is processed natural gas. Claiming that it is not fossil fuel because it has been processed is a transparent lie.
948 2018-10-11 22:09:43 So we are celebrating geological serendipity of oil quality over Canadian ingenuity?  Stupid.
949 2018-10-11 22:09:38 Are we under a trade imbargo? have oil as our main export? Rely on oil too much? Nope! Yet again bad modelling.

952 2018-10-11 22:09:18 That the Kurds have shed blood doesn't give them the right to take 100% control of majority of Syria's oil. Not only that, but the Kurds have invited and allowed the US to illegally occupy 1/3 of Syria.
953 2018-10-11 22:09:13 Snake Oil Salesman.

960 2018-10-11 22:08:04 How many innocent people have been killed by our illegal wars? And your crocodile tears are falling for 1 journalist? 

It is indeed sad to see how gross our corporate oil... eerr "ally" treats journalists, but don't pretend you give a shit about 1 life when covering 4 warmongers

971 2018-10-11 22:06:46 Actually it was about Gudafi and what he was trying to do.They framed it that he was going to murder his own people,it was nothing to do with a war on islam ;) you seem to be ill informed,it was about oil control and a dictator they didnt like,just like WMD in iraq,it was oil
972 2018-10-11 22:06:45 For years Tories didn't give a shit about people being unemployed if it meant they could shut their mines mills & factories down & destroy unions,they could rot on the dole at the expense of North Sea oil & gas. Today they need a scapegoat to let their banker buddies off the hook
973 2018-10-11 22:06:40 Lol where did you get your oil change done
974 2018-10-11 22:06:30 Climate change is a fallacy introduced to bring competition to a monopolised big oil market. Its purpose is to keep oil barrell prices down and oil rich countries at bay and increase taxes on the general population. Carbon dioxide isnt toxic and phase changes releases energy/heat
975 2018-10-11 22:06:20 We got oil. Get Texas through the door.
976 2018-10-11 22:06:16 I stopped to get an oil change and walked out having to pay for a new battery and a list of other stuff. 
977 2018-10-11 22:06:04 My girl Cali gets them too every now and again... I use treats and CBD oil to stop them
978 2018-10-11 22:06:00 Companies don’t spend capital. They lay-off employees. The oil is still being produced, for now, but something has to give. It looks like another recession for Alberta is upcoming, due in large part to no pipeline.
979 2018-10-11 22:05:49 OIL ON THE ROAD!
980 2018-10-11 22:05:40 Hope they drop you in burning oil and turn you crisp so you cant enjoy what you stole from others pockets savings home equity furniture cars.. hope you burn to a crisp our money comes back to us who studied since we were 2 worked saved sweated and did everything right for decades

982 2018-10-11 22:05:22 @SEC_Investor_Ed why is it ok for retail to invest in (i) a 3x leverage oil etf in which the underlying commodity is at least in part controlled by terrorists and countries that oppress freedom of expression based on sex and (ii) not an ICO? i am concerned about both.  thank you

988 2018-10-11 22:04:41 Not as simple as you make it seem for many reasons. Norway’s production is high output per well offshore production getting a world price. It was capitalized during the 80’s oil boom. Alberta requires outside capital.

1001 2018-10-11 22:03:29 I honestly don’t care about last century’s debate about big/small government. The debate now is about life as usual vs business as usual. Business can handle a few shocks, such as closing down an oil company; life can not handle any more shocks.

1016 2018-10-11 22:01:28 We can stop it now with independence. Having all the money from oil will give us more than enough money too set up a county too be proud off.

1029 2018-10-11 21:59:24 Another news article had predicted the migration crisis in Venezuela will likely exceed the migration crisis in Syria. It is sad to see with $81 oil prices a country with such huge oil resources can't even feed its citizens due to economic mismanagement.

1031 2018-10-11 21:59:08 Gulf water temp is up by 2-4 degrees resulting in wind turbulence.  Big Oil cons Stooges in politics. Big Oil is enemy of the people.  Free Energy from ETs has been available and concealed since the 50’s.

1056 2018-10-11 21:57:11 I believe many of these young men didn’t finish high school during the boom and went to work in the oil patch. Those jobs disappeared. Now these guys are uneducated and not employable. A job training program is needed

But that was back when people said the quiet part quietly!

1074 2018-10-11 21:55:58 How do you figure? The oil is still there to be used at a later date. And with oil prices rising they might actually get more money for it. Usually only economists believe is selling resources as fast as possible, sometimes it’s better to wait until the price is right.  #cdnpoli

No high just benefits. Animals in zoo's are being treated for tumors, IBD, mental issues, seizure, etc.
1100 2018-10-11 21:53:12 Here in US they always give some sorry excuse to raise gas price to make profit on oil stocks and bank accounts and I don't where your oil supply comes from?  And owers comes from Alaska and split off to other lines and priced that way.->
1101 2018-10-11 21:52:59 Bernie is a coalition member?  NO.  He’s divisive.  That’s his brand and always has been.  The winning Obama coalition included young college educated whites, which Bernie carved off by selling them his free college snake oil which he knew he couldn’t deliver.
1102 2018-10-11 21:52:56 Low current. Fuck u nepa. Giving us palm oil current
1103 2018-10-11 21:52:51 I bet Trumpski's father sold snake oil too.
1104 2018-10-11 21:52:48 Getting a oil change, I hate waiting
1105 2018-10-11 21:52:47 @joerogan so the fish oil that you take by the tablespoon, does it taste "fishy"? Don't know that I could stomach that.

1107 2018-10-11 21:52:38 44 years when oil was booming and when it finally crashed, albertans voted them out smartly realizing that they could not govern without truckloads of money. Anyone can govern without a ton of debt when they are working with the money that is generated from oil at +$100/barrel
1108 2018-10-11 21:52:19 bitch u all crackers WITH OIL BC YOU'RE SOUTHERN EUROPEANS

1110 2018-10-11 21:51:52 You mean how depressing the NDP have become.
This is a giant non event that the NDP are clinging to bcz heading into an election all they have is a wrecked economy, high debt, high deficits, six credit downgrades, a collapsing oil industry and escalating consumer costs & taxes.
1111 2018-10-11 21:51:32 Yeah well it's not in many and I have busted my ass trying to get at least the oil approved.
1112 2018-10-11 21:51:25 The weed oil high is just not the same as a blunt high
1113 2018-10-11 21:51:24 White people support murdering animals for sport, bombing countries, invading their land for oil talking about "Fighting for our freedom", then turn around and say black people violent criminals . They do worse shit but polish it up as traditionalism.
1114 2018-10-11 21:51:10 Hi Kelly, I worked in and around Houston for two months a few years ago. A guy from there took me to a gas station that had a grill in the back for “the best burger I’d ever have” he was appalled that I put ketchup on it. Is that a Texas thing?? Not ketchup on burgers
1115 2018-10-11 21:50:56 Do you know that if a scientist applies for a grant it is almost impossible to get funding unless they can somehow link their research to climate change?

Do you think that this lends itself to honesty and objectivity? Like oil companies, scientists also have vested interests.

1117 2018-10-11 21:50:49 #Alberta its 6 mths to break the NDPs grasp in the Province. With the fed Liberals destroying the Canadian economy, provincial economies are very important as we move forward! We need to mov our oil to foriegn markets or building refinery to mak our own gasoline! #NDPmustGo

1120 2018-10-11 21:50:33 Almost everything.  There's one thing I'm gonna keep on burnin'.......but with ya on the rest.  We have the technology to ditch fossil fuels AND employ a TON of people in the process, but those with fortunes built on oil will never have it,.  They call the shots. For now.
1121 2018-10-11 21:50:32 A large part of Trump’s platform was expanding the US oil and gas industry, and he is really pushing exports to Eastern Europe. Why wouldn’t he have people who know about that stuff around?
1122 2018-10-11 21:50:29 So do I now 47k but I go home every night now see my boy.. The money made at amazon was over 2k.

1125 2018-10-11 21:50:15 Abusive people try to minimize their behavior and use a gaslighting tactic to deflect from their behavior.  Eric Holder, I dare you to come to Middle America and kick a farmer, a factory worker, an oil worker, it would not be a wise idea.
1126 2018-10-11 21:50:04 Awesome to see an oil producing leader taking full advantage of their resources and maximizing their profits and reinvesting into more innovative greener energy.
1127 2018-10-11 21:50:03 Fabio walked away from the oil refinery as it exploded, the shockwave ruffling his perfect hair. He never looked back, for cool guys don't look at explosions

1131 2018-10-11 21:49:17 @wolfblitzer It's the 'CC' words, CLIMATE CHANGE Stupid. But I hear CNN is too invested in gas and oil sponsors to tell us the truth. I guess you're paid a lot to accept censorship.
1132 2018-10-11 21:49:16 Sounds like it will be CBD oil that gets removed from the list. Because it has not getting high involved. I sure hope that they just treat the stuff that helps me with my pain like alcohol. It is insane they put it in the same level as Heroine that is proof they are clueless

1141 2018-10-11 21:48:27 I agree. The common denominator for Russia, Saudi Arabia, US, China, Venezuela & North Korea is oil. Kochs own oil refineries.

1147 2018-10-11 21:47:30 Discovered today that cannabis is a family - not just A plant. There's hemp, and marijuana. Hemp gives more oil, which is the therapeutic bit, and marijuana gives the desire for pizza, Pink Floyd and giggles. Simples. When govt banned "cannabis" they banned both. Genius.

1151 2018-10-11 21:47:15 Between selling arms to Saudi Arabia and Saudi oil replacing Iranian oil, Trump does not give a rat's ass about a journalist who is not a US citizen getting wacked by the Saudis.

1160 2018-10-11 21:46:33 I have done oil with mixed media, embossing powder and clay. It is a tremendous effort but so wonderful when it does not go astray.  We should get art cards going between a group of us.  Maybe for Christmas?
1161 2018-10-11 21:46:30 His narrative remains bearing on oil overall as every comment regarding supply, demand and inventories leans bearish, but he never goes into the reasons for the builds as you mentioned. Kinda of sad really, as he is very misleading to those who don't fully understand the business
1162 2018-10-11 21:46:23 It’s reasonable for people to buy things based on how they are produced and manufactured, like buying glass vs plastic, avoiding palm oil etc. But basing a boycott off a label that simply gives consumers information that may or may not be relevant seems, ah, frivolous at best.

1181 2018-10-11 21:44:38 Is it possible that players other than the Saudies are manipulating the oil market? Why aren't more US oil rigs coming online to take advantage of these high prices? Also, Trump lacks any common sense or diplomacy and can only ratchet up more economic conflict and oil prices...
1182 2018-10-11 21:44:16 8) And the last implementation is that you have a plan where all new roof shingles must be solar shingles. This way we can shutdown Oil, Natural Gas, and Coal power plants across the country. 
Our country will end up having more electricity than it needs, and we could sell to USA
1183 2018-10-11 21:44:12 Come off it. Scientists are not going to stick to a wrong theory just to prove a point. Everyone who works with nature is saying they see the negative impact. 9 times out of 10 Scientists who try to disprove the theories are link to financial backing from oil companies.
1184 2018-10-11 21:44:12 This is a sanction that loses the US a lot of money.  We're not naive enough to believe that the loss of billions doesn't enter into it.  Sanctions against a country aren't supposed to hurt you.  There are other ways to do this.  Like....don't buy Saudi oil until further notice
1185 2018-10-11 21:43:56 As opposed to owners from a country which made its money on slavery creating terrorist organisations and fighting fake wars. Yeah I’d take the oil money.
1186 2018-10-11 21:43:54 Go back to the creation of the kingdom of the House of Saud in the 1900s and you will see how the West has been supporting regime after regime of thugs and murders, who sit on an ocean of oil; which the West will do everything to protect. 
Why?  Sell them arms & Borrow money.

1189 2018-10-11 21:43:29 I just cannot think this is funny. He & other oil execs should be on death row for knowing 50+ yrs. ago & making sure it was kept secret.

1193 2018-10-11 21:43:02 You have a good point. Also, oil is used to manufacture plastics. I try to avoid single-use plastics, but I'd a lot rather use them in, say, medical devices such as stunts, tubing, etc., than burn them.
1194 2018-10-11 21:43:02 Oh let's just drop the bs for once...
Until our reliance on oil is gone it will ALWAYS be in our best interest to keep the middle east destabilized. That's why we've done it, and continue to do it. Let's just acknowledge this obvious fact.
1195 2018-10-11 21:42:57 can we organize a "send a bag of steaming poop to a oil industry executive every day until something is done about climate change" movement?
1196 2018-10-11 21:42:53 That’s the narrative, but no substance to that claim. He wants to abolish immigration agents, ban extraction of oil and natural gas, and focus on social issues. Not standing behind what you stand for and calling that bipartisanship is a thin veil.

It’s just narrow minded and doesn’t even consider full lifecycle, grid balance, environmental impacts or bottlenecks etc on a world scale. Hydrogen replaces oil on a like for like comparison. But it’s green. Thx

1222 2018-10-11 21:40:04 That’d be like asking your mechanic to give you special pricing because you need an oil change again. Wife told me I should price increases due to health insurance costs.  imagine explaining that to clients.

1229 2018-10-11 21:39:35 Over at the Capitol, the Senate just approved a climate change skeptic a& former Big Oil attorney to lead the DOJ’s environment division.

1239 2018-10-11 21:38:17 Just adding on- reminder that fashion is the second biggest pollutant in the world after oil. Sometimes it not just about our plastic use, but also our need to be unnecessary. Be considerate and don't waste
1240 2018-10-11 21:38:07 Mankind has pillaged this earth and thousands upon thousands of these animals have died, become extinct and are at risk of disappearing altogether because of us. We are not the most intelligent species if we continue to destroy habitats, poach, drill for more oil. Make a stand.

1254 2018-10-11 21:37:04 I'm not against that idea. 

Here's an alternative, though: use those oil & gas exploration government subsidies to instead fund R&D to push beyond the 30% Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit threshold for solar; institute a carbon-tax to subsidize renewables. 

Replant forests!

1269 2018-10-11 21:35:32 We know fossil fuel is damaging. In the long run, using the natural resources of the earth will prove better and cheaper. The only people who don't want that to happen is the oil guzzlers that want their profit.

1271 2018-10-11 21:35:25 I don’t believe in nail hardeners so I just recommend keeping them moisturized with some sort of oil and taking supplements like biotin
1272 2018-10-11 21:35:25 Agree to disagree on this one. 
Now let's hope for a big win tonight for the Oil!

#HSBC jumped on the #Iranian-phobia bandwagon last week and predicted $100 a barrel oil was coming. Such a 'me-too' mindset has damaged the bank's credibility during the current free-fall of #USOil.

1278 2018-10-11 21:35:05 If I make pasta, boil it before adding some oil and garlic then I have made dinner. If my wife adds tomatoes and peppers she has made it.

1281 2018-10-11 21:34:48 Any gov form before Chavismo would have seen at least some level of economic recovery by now with oil at $80 a barrel. That is what they used to do. That is what oil prizes used to mean. Now, not even that.
1282 2018-10-11 21:34:24 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
1283 2018-10-11 21:34:12 Anyway: my focus since over a decade is clean, shared mobility ecosystems-starting from premium tech and working to mainstream. We are on the same clean side of this: and that is where the future is headed. We will see where adaptation takes us. First steps first. Replace oil.
1284 2018-10-11 21:34:05 Do you evidence to back up this your allegation of renewal of oil block?  Or you heard it somewhere?

1293 2018-10-11 21:32:40 I agree, but Prez trump has the highest approval ratings of many categories.

1303 2018-10-11 21:31:54 the world has allowed Saudi Arabia to become this bold by allowing reliance on the desert oil. The solution is simple. Move away from oil dependence and stop trade with the Middle East including Saudi Arabia.
1304 2018-10-11 21:31:51 Very, very smart on their part. I bet they speed up their timetable, though. We're past peak oil production and coal mining is almost non-existent.

1361 2018-10-11 21:24:27 It surely does, No matter what what you want to tell yourself. 
Would there be a PFD without oil extraction? No 
Is the PFD directly linked to resource development. Yes. 
Are dividend gains made from resource development around the world. Yes. 
Too much logic for you to absorb.
1362 2018-10-11 21:24:25 Does nobody see the irony that @Shell promotes planting trees to combat CO2 emissions while it destroys the environment to extract gas and oil?
Not just #greenwash but a #GreatSwitcheroo #FlimFlam #Huckster trick.
Remember #Nigeria?
#WeAreWatching
1363 2018-10-11 21:24:23 Is the crude oil money only for infrastructure? What about recurrent expenditures, sundries and the likes.
1364 2018-10-11 21:24:22 These IFAs don't care about you ladies, their only interests are their own financial situations.
They charge (IMO) extortionate rates for what can be achieved on line.
Someone says " they are the 21st century equivalent of snake oil salesmen ".

1367 2018-10-11 21:24:04 It’s made with pork fat. The rest uses vegetable oil.
1368 2018-10-11 21:24:03 No looted funds to buy and fuel private jets, diminished tithes, no freely allocated oil blocs, VAIDS, EO6, EO8, no brown envelopes from @AsoRock. He's empowering the poor they want perpetually oppressed for their selfish gains.
1369 2018-10-11 21:23:56 Yesterday it was Tech stocks, it is the democrats that are calling for mob rule & confrontation, kicking that caused a pause, now oil as people are seeing how Muslims have over run the EU and most countries want out!! Civil war not good for markets.
1370 2018-10-11 21:23:48 We do need a lifestyle change, but it has to be on a societal level, not an individual one. We have to collectively figure out alternatives to meat, cars, oil, etc. We have to make sure everyone still has everything they need
1371 2018-10-11 21:23:31 Relationship status: eating microwave popcorn and pasta with olive oil for dinner at 4:23 p.m.
1372 2018-10-11 21:23:17 The POLICE is doing the greedy OIL companies JOB to easy! The PIPELINES LEAK & should be SHUT DOWN! They Get to destroy the human right to have CLEAN water & GOV w/ TRUMP is FUCKING CORRUPT & THIS IS a FUCKING HORRIBLE SHAM & A DISGRACE! Police should protect the WATERPROTECTORS!
1373 2018-10-11 21:23:14 Baked meat/ roasted

You could cut out oil in your diet. 
I don't mean it spitefully either.
1374 2018-10-11 21:23:12 My dad, 20 years ago:
Marijuana is for losers and one puff will turn you into a worthless junkie.

My dad, now:
You got a headache? Smoke a joint, rub this cannabis oil on your head, shove this cannabis suppository up your ass, and eat five of these brownies.

1376 2018-10-11 21:23:09 They have oil and billions in US investments. Of COURSE nothing with happen.
1377 2018-10-11 21:22:58 scientists have experimentally shown that carbon dioxide traps heat since the 1860s, before oil execs had input. Moreover, hurricanes are getting stronger & more frequent & islands are going under. How can you tell suffering people their problems aren’t real?
1378 2018-10-11 21:22:43 @toddmccomas @nickmaraldo @Digz when I play madden and I’m at Lucas Oil I always pretend like you guys are in that stadium watching me and my created player @PatMcAfeeShow punt again!
1379 2018-10-11 21:22:31 @miqmilim > Migrants from sub-Saharan Africa should solve their  issues with corrupt leaders in their own countries, some of which are rich in minerals & oil. Not run away. Here in UK we did. Europe can't be the safety net on such a large scale.

1381 2018-10-11 21:22:26 For me it's to even out my skin tone and keep my t-zone from looking like an oil slick. I like it bc it's light coverage but buildable. My favorite liquid foundation, though, is UD Naked Skin One & Done.

1399 2018-10-11 21:20:13 Step 1) Taxpayers subsidize big oil.
Step 2) Taxpayers subsidize hurricane cleanup.
Step 3) 
Step 4) Big Oil & Kochs Profit.

Repeat forever.

1405 2018-10-11 21:19:47 Farmers are paid by the hectare for owning/using land; the more you have, the more you get. Some landowners receive £1m+. You don’t even have to live in the EU, just to own land here. Among the tourists sucking up public funds Russian oligarchs, Saudi princes and Texas oil barons

1415 2018-10-11 21:18:31 Finally got my oil change
1416 2018-10-11 21:18:18 You gotta understand niggas, alcohol and young white women don’t mix.  It’s like putting olive oil in some Hennessy.
1417 2018-10-11 21:18:16 Oil Blocks! Oil Blocks!! Oil Blocks!!!
1418 2018-10-11 21:18:02 It also helps to have a ungodly amount of oil to drill, refine and then sell...cause you know that’ll really create a large economy...not Republicans or liberals...but the oil.
1419 2018-10-11 21:18:02 When are you gonna but the beard oil I see you’re in need of it

1421 2018-10-11 21:17:43 2019-2023: BUHARI is the only OIL minister in Nigeria without OIL well. I challenge you to name one without oil well #TheBuhariChallenge
1422 2018-10-11 21:17:42 If I and all my vegan friends stop driving cars then the government will have to stop paying the oil industry! And every single corporation and institution that funds the industry will have to divest! And everyone else in the entire world will also stop driving! I solved it!!
1423 2018-10-11 21:17:16 I truly do not think those who offer themselves as leaders or leaders in waiting truly know how to make money or govern without Oil and Gas.

1426 2018-10-11 21:16:46 Nick took the car to Midas for an oil change, and they gave us another sticker for the collection!

1428 2018-10-11 21:16:12 In my country there's one shop that sell rose water, pure 100% without cemicals and my skin become +++++. I also dont have any pimples except if my period was around;; maybe you can try to search rose water? 
Also argan oil is good
1429 2018-10-11 21:16:11 It’s almost as if most of his campaign contributions come from big oil.
1430 2018-10-11 21:16:09 We buy oil from them, not the  opposite. Small wonder he's filed bankruptcy numerous times.
1431 2018-10-11 21:16:05 Market (and bonds) SHOULD have rallied from softer CPI,  lower oil,  and also from  report of China - US discussions.  
Horrible in context.

1439 2018-10-11 21:15:39 Higher trade volumes / volatility probably helps their index business too.   Also volatility in Oil prices helps Platts business.
1440 2018-10-11 21:15:16 I don’t know where you live, but as a Coloradan I would not support him. He was a great mayor, but he sold us out to fracking and oil and gas interests and campaigned against Medicare for All. Not the right guy for this time. He hasn’t been good for our state.
1441 2018-10-11 21:15:09 palm oil harvest is destroying tropical rain forests.
1442 2018-10-11 21:15:05 You know it’s getting cold outside when the coconut oil starts getting hard 
1443 2018-10-11 21:14:58 Watch as the price of oil starts a slow steady decline.   POTUS will use this to our advantage against the Saudi’s - they will have no choice!
1444 2018-10-11 21:14:52 Oh so maybe Tesla should give away cars for free even,  not only supercharging.   What abt asking the oil companies to give away gas?
1445 2018-10-11 21:14:46 economic growth - as we always do with high crude oil sales. However, economic devt (in real terms) will always elude us since we've decided to 'live like rogues led by roving bandits' by not investing in the real sector. Un4tunately, the solution does not lie with the current

1452 2018-10-11 21:13:06 Honest question, is the essential oils thing in lip products safe?  Its not like baking extracts, I highly doubt its intended for the mouth... Pure oil or not... I could be wrong so educate me if I am mistaken.

1458 2018-10-11 21:12:54 I started with grand's photo in Affinity Photo and then printed in out onto acrylic sheet; from there it got layers with a mix of water colors and baby oil to get the ethereal feel.

1460 2018-10-11 21:12:47 The two Bush president's had close ties too. It's all about making money and oil.
1461 2018-10-11 21:12:45 I insulted nobody. That was you. You brought the oil industry workers into this in a shameful way. Again with the assumptions. You just cannot accept that you alone made error in words in such a horrid way. So you stop it.
1462 2018-10-11 21:12:34 I found walnut alkyd oil makes oils dry so nice and fast. : )
1463 2018-10-11 21:12:13 Dictator Erdogan sold Jamal Khashoggi to Saudis and they took him to Riad.. Turks need money and Saudi oil.. He entered the embassy and from there he was taken to the airport. #WashingtonPost, #CNN
1464 2018-10-11 21:12:05 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.

1466 2018-10-11 21:12:00 They could I suppose, but why would they?
And what would you expect from their "independence": to remain in the UK or to be truly indy?
They aren't the same thing in relation to how much of the Oil fields Shetland could lay claim to.

1468 2018-10-11 21:11:37 For everyone stating E15 will raise smog in summer months... did you know that E15 is already allowed in EPA's non-attainment areas (areas having air quality issues) b/c  of the benefits to air quality? Don't buy what Big Oil is selling! E15 is cleaner & benefits us. #ethanol
1469 2018-10-11 21:11:26 Anxiety has been AWFUL since I’ve cut back on CBD oil. I HATE Alabama’s law - declaring CBD oil illegal. That oil has helped me SO MUCH!
1470 2018-10-11 21:11:23 They gang up to fight against the oil wells seizure. We the masses will gang up against the looters and thieves. We are waiting for 2019 to come...
1471 2018-10-11 21:11:20 He just doesn't want oil shooting to $200/barrel if he sanctions Saudi Arabia--as the Saudis would cut off oil sales to the US. He's a hypocrite--it's all about the oil.
1472 2018-10-11 21:11:04 The mandate was needed to break into a monopoly, now it holds progress up, higher blends are being sold in MN bc it makes $$, the octane is needed to Sub-Zero so oil makes more $$ w etoh, oil industry appears to want to sacrifice margin to monopolize market
1473 2018-10-11 21:11:03 It’s happening... I’m turning into the crazy essential oil lady 
1474 2018-10-11 21:11:02 I know a woman who’s arm was badly damaged from hot oil. A beautiful tattoo now covers her scar to and makes her feel better.
1475 2018-10-11 21:10:57 And it is a country with oil !
1476 2018-10-11 21:10:54 Pass what?! Biko come here let's do our wedding. I want to eat all oil stew
1477 2018-10-11 21:10:53 Bravo à vous. Petite question: serait-il possible de faire interdire la publicité pour les voitures les plus polluantes, comme on interdit la publicité pour l'alcool et la tabac? Après tout, il s'agit d'un enjeu de santé publique

1482 2018-10-11 21:10:05 A simple question we get a lot... "So, magnesium oil sounds great, how do you use it?"

1. Apply to skin
2. Rub it in

That's it! Your skin absorbs the magnesium in about 20-30 minutes to increase your overall #magnesium levels.

1494 2018-10-11 21:09:04 Pro tip: if you ever need oil or butter for a dish, fry up some bacon and use the fat.

Sautéed onions/peppers? Bacon fat.
Hash browns/potatoes? Bacon fat.
Pan seared chicken? Bacon fat.

1502 2018-10-11 21:08:11 fried some potato and onions with chili oil and I think I made tasty tear gas

time to turn this frying pan into a crying pan
1503 2018-10-11 21:08:10 Absolutely. Except for the not buying their oil part.
1504 2018-10-11 21:07:58 #OPEC lowers global demand forecast and oil drops.
1505 2018-10-11 21:07:49 I don’t often agree but yes, they gave us 9/11, it’s all about oil. Go green.
1506 2018-10-11 21:07:40 This is a start. Sort of like “Exxon scoops up 800 buckets of oil from blackened coastline.”
1507 2018-10-11 21:07:36 Working at the refineries really ain’t Oil & Gas money lol
1508 2018-10-11 21:07:33 Came accross this>
IAEA figures show 45% of nuclear plants use the sea for once-through cooling, 15% use lakes, 14% rivers, and 26% use cooling towers. * CCGT plants have an oil or gas-fired gas turbine coupled to a generator.
1509 2018-10-11 21:07:28 Key takeaway from today's conference at the #BakerInstitute: The EIA expects oil prod. at the Permian basin to hit 3.9 mmbd in 2019, up from an avg of 3.3 mmbd in 2018. 
Want these numbers in perspective? In #Mexico, to increase oil prod. in 0.6 mmbd may take 6 years, experts say

1513 2018-10-11 21:06:58 So should we put the lid back on the anointing oil?

1516 2018-10-11 21:06:32 @MBuhari  u work only in the North and west, employ only Notherners in a "Federal Gov't", used ur 3yrs n half searching for crude oil on a dry land while u have not managed the one in the south well as a Petroleum minister and President. Wetin u gain Mr. Buhari? @OfficialPDPNig
1517 2018-10-11 21:06:27 That’s great, now what are the steps you’re going to take towards environmental issues. From my understanding oil companies want to start drilling and ruining the natural pathways of water which also effects the fishing industry.
1518 2018-10-11 21:06:21 MEDIA, without evidence, directly accused Trump of colluding with Russia. Sold public the colluion snake oil in hopes of it being true.  Can you people be any more phony? You are Liberal hacks who pretend to be journalists. #fakenews
1519 2018-10-11 21:06:11 I am questioning the humpback whales needs?!!!! How are the Eels living caverns? Are they lined with crude oil? When the whales jump out of the sea do they grab an eel to migrate to the colder climates?

1523 2018-10-11 21:05:36 A uniquely Jockanese unit of fine measurement is the baw hair and widely used for fine tuning all things mechanical and Instrument in the oil industry. Please remind me though, how many midges d*cks = 1 baw hair? Its been a wee while..
1524 2018-10-11 21:05:33 At WBES students created their own tide pools and learned about animals and plants that may be found there. Tomorrow we will check if our community air is clean, update on our soil samples and try to clean up and oil spill.
1525 2018-10-11 21:05:29 We are not talking about taking away profit motive. We are talking about "reasonable" profit not what the drug companies are getting away with. And the oil companies. You want free markets lets make them really free and do away with patents.
1526 2018-10-11 21:05:24 I think I remember reading something about Canadian oil selling cheaper on the world market. I am correct on this @GeorgeMurphyOil or was it a bad dream?

1528 2018-10-11 21:05:23 (1/2) I’m getting an oil change at an auto dealership. Reading the newspaper. A woman also waiting comes by  where I’m sitting with two small empty water bottles and says, “Please tell me you’re recycling these.” After a few second I realize she thinks I work here. Ok fine.
1529 2018-10-11 21:05:19 Cut out dr pepper its a few consistencies off of motor oil imo
1530 2018-10-11 21:05:16 I’m pretty sure this is way before the cabal to stop backing the US dollar with gold commodities and start backing US dollar with crude oil from the Middle East. I believe because of that, we perpetuate wars especially in that region.#Petrodollar#GlobalBankers#Neocons #Lobbyists
1531 2018-10-11 21:05:12 Crude oil futures for Nov/Dec lower Thursday evening. $WTI_Crude -3.09% at $70.91, $NBZ_F -3.45% at $80.20, $USO -2.80% at $14.95 for 10/11/18.
1532 2018-10-11 21:05:11 It would not matter who sat in WH if they had a D or a R next to their name. Our Dollar is tied to oil. It's called the petrodollar. most of the Terrorist on 9-11 were from Saudi.  might not be much more push back if he was a citizen...
1533 2018-10-11 21:05:07 This statement is very ignorant.  California is GOLD.  OIL. Natural Gas. A huge source of food to the world.  California is also RED, and not blue.  #VoterFraud.  But wait, November is coming!

1537 2018-10-11 21:04:45 OK I've seen another post about black seed oil. What does it do for you as far as health is concerned? 

How many of yall have tried it/use it? #QTNA
1538 2018-10-11 21:04:43 we are all gonna die because so many of those 100 companies behind the %71 are oil and coal and gas. unless everybody goes renewable in the next 13 years we are gonna die
1539 2018-10-11 21:04:39 This article is full of misinformation and far fetched science.  “Apart from the scientific evidence that ethanol-based particles in air can kill people and make them sick.” Really?  Sounds like a little protect my market share oil story.

1541 2018-10-11 21:04:14 Goldman Sachs analyst Charles Himmelberg called yesterday’s correction a “‘U.S. growth-off’ event,” he wrote in a note. “This growth repricing helps square the circle with last week’s sharp repricing of monetary policy and oil supply.”  What the hell does than mean?
1542 2018-10-11 21:04:12 You vegan but use palm oil do research
1543 2018-10-11 21:04:12 But it is his job. Who is going to tell oil/coal workers that they are out of work and on the dole? The same person who will then also find himself out of work as he is voted out. Sorry to say that there is no hope- but that's tomorrows problem!
1544 2018-10-11 21:04:01 But what about those of us who must buy oil to commute, or those whose business is logistics? That cost gets passed on to the consumer, making everything more expensive, taking even more from those who don’t have enough. That ok with you?
1545 2018-10-11 21:04:00 If you have a number three husband, you may be in luck. Being certain he wants to stop, you can go to him with this volume as joyfully as though you had struck oil. p.113 #BigBook #AA #XA

1550 2018-10-11 21:03:38 So he can sell out the rest of the country to oil and gas the way he did Colorado, and campaign against Medicare for All? No thank you. Loved him as Mayor, but he hasn’t been good for us at all as Governor.
1551 2018-10-11 21:03:32 It does for me. I use the navy blue bottle for very dry skin, mixed with coconut oil
1552 2018-10-11 21:03:26 I think the equation goes like this; Saudi oil trumps human life.

1554 2018-10-11 21:03:05 It'd be fun to look back at the Wings PP to see how the 5 lefties executed a successful PP. Unlike the Oil, I can almost wager that the attack was QB'd from the left or point giving a chance of a one time from right side. Looks like we QB from the right side giving QB the shot.

1558 2018-10-11 21:02:59 Doom and gloom sells. There are a bunch of forgotten economists who sold some books in the 70s about how we would now be out of oil and most other resources.

1564 2018-10-11 21:02:24 If he is busy with me he is leaving other alone. Another one is Nicholas Jones or jobs... he says "the oil rig thing too. He making 40million this time afte he pays his employees he's retiring. Etc..."
1565 2018-10-11 21:02:24 It baffles me anyone would think Jones a great intellect. My father, a history professor, would always stress the importance of research over the pretence of knowledge and wisdom. Jones, who predicted an oil crisis based on a Frederick Forsyth novel, is no "intellect".
1566 2018-10-11 21:02:17 We don’t want him back here! Maybe there’s a rock he could slither back under? Or a traveling caravan he could join? I’ll bet he’d make a good snake oil salesman 
1567 2018-10-11 21:02:11 I’m getting an oil change at a place that does them while you’re in ur car  and the dude who did the work thinks it’s appropriate to lean his head into my car and say “your arm tattoos are nice,  but your legs are nicer”..... #merica #maga #yourmomslegs
1568 2018-10-11 21:02:11 Yup go to any mechanic oil rig ect you will hear far more worse  things  that the soup boys have said
1569 2018-10-11 21:02:01 @IndulekhaCare using hair oil for last 6 years. Recently noticed that oil is leaking from the bottle by itself. It’s not an isolated case. Please improve the quality of the bottle.
1570 2018-10-11 21:01:45 GP appts aren’t free at point of use but hospital care is but yes, different choices. The NHS was around for some 30 years before oil. Not asking you specifically but surely a key question is why does your fiscal transfer exist?

1574 2018-10-11 21:01:27 Remember as well that Russia has a defense pact with China. There's also the financial BRIC agreement.
Brazil, Russia, India, China. The push is to replace the US dollar as gold standard for commodities like oil. Now the 20 military ships off the coast of Venezuela.  @POTUS
1575 2018-10-11 21:01:23 CA Gov Jerry Brown signed SB 1409 into law, updating the definition of “industrial #hemp” in California to differentiate it from cannabis, allowing farmers in the state to produce seed, oil, fiber, and extract. The expanded hemp laws go into effect January 1, 2019.

1587 2018-10-11 21:00:22 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats

1589 2018-10-11 21:00:19 The problem is meat, oil, coal, etc. production, not consumption

1597 2018-10-11 20:59:25 What more emblematic of the rejection of the capitalist cult than leaving immense wealth lying untouched? As humanity will choose to do with immense cornucopias of coal and oil
1598 2018-10-11 20:59:21 Why don’t the “climate Marxists” just apply Marxism to the extraction industry? Ie, pitch in via taxes to cover the means of production then share the profit generated from oil sales? That’s what Marxism is.

1606 2018-10-11 20:58:19 Not at all.

 You made a comment about whinny oil industry workers around the time of the downturn. It was crass. It's an affront to every family who lost someone to the suicide spike that year. 

You have no shame.

1614 2018-10-11 20:57:24 But unlike CC, the whole world isn’t directly affected by what happens in the Middle East (w/ maybe the exception being oil production). At some point, when there’re more & more freak tsunamis & hurricanes & dead fish washing up on shores, the world will have to come together

1617 2018-10-11 20:57:19 "I got magic shoes, but shorter legs. Probably evens out, I reckon." He continues to polish his revolvers with the oil.
1618 2018-10-11 20:57:18 UK is again different from US. When Exxon and API starts promoting EVs, then natural gas will have escaped oil interests. There is enough pure natural gas companies to seek market share from oil by promoting EVs. But they don't now do it. Not going to happen soon. Why not?

1620 2018-10-11 20:57:01 If you agree that Oil will eventually trade back below $50/barrel then checkout chart on OILD, it is triple bear ETF on oil. I think solar and wind will pressure oil prices downward long term. Great trade on AMD!
1621 2018-10-11 20:56:54 Ladies these are a must have: Lavender Oil, Tea tree Oil, witch Hazel and Cetaphil. Thank me later
1622 2018-10-11 20:56:53 I cannot even say how ridiculous such news are as they intentionally lead a GENOCIDE of 18 MILLION through STARVATION. Why do you not report that OIL has been found in North Yemen and the terrorist narrative is BS?
1623 2018-10-11 20:56:43 First time in 3 weeks having bubbles in my bath tonight instead of lavender oil & OH MY GOD it feels like heaven

1636 2018-10-11 20:55:10 So support the pipeline and stop shipping oil in tanker cars down the banks of BC salmon rivers. Practise what your so fond of preaching.
1637 2018-10-11 20:55:05 I’m out of coconut oil 
1638 2018-10-11 20:55:05 I can only vote in one country, I am focusing on what I can do here. If you believe climate change is a hoax or a conspiracy we have nothing further to discuss. Burning oil and coal by the billions is unsustainable.
1639 2018-10-11 20:55:04 A lot of Nigerians will unfortunately sell their votes for one derica of rice and oil, forgetting this will not sustain them for the next 4 years.

Sell your snake oil elsewhere. Like at a Rally? It might be tons feel as I do, educated guess-based on experience shown, & thinks truth is something you hide from yourself. No trust left. #CultureOfCorruption
1642 2018-10-11 20:54:41 If you’re charging more than $40 for the weed oil cartridges you’re really shot out and shouldn’t be selling lmao
1643 2018-10-11 20:54:26 £65M in North Sea oil industry investment terms is the root sum of SFA. It’ll hire a semi-sub floater for 2 months. Perspective is called for.
1644 2018-10-11 20:54:13 And Uganda would be producing oil and cars, having a new president by 2018

1649 2018-10-11 20:53:38 I’m sorry for what you go through. CBD oil. It has so many medicinal properties it’s unfathomable. Big Pharma banned it because cures don’t make money. I’m sure you’ve researched it. Prayers to you. Big

1652 2018-10-11 20:52:59 It's a VW product, so take that as you will. Off the top of my head, the only issue a friend of mine had was that it liked to drink oil. Unfortunately, they were never sold in the US ;;
1653 2018-10-11 20:52:57 Definitely one of the more existentially challenging parts of my day is self-administering CBD oil and insulin in a public toilet.
1654 2018-10-11 20:52:55 they set plastic on fire and rolled it in oil and hoped we wouldnt notice the difference
1655 2018-10-11 20:52:54 I think we need to give up oil. industrialization electricity and all the things causing it. Lets revert back to the stone age. Lord know its a concrete jungle in most cities. 
Let see how that works to feed the earth. 
1656 2018-10-11 20:52:49 Old enough and educated enough to remember what country most of the 9/11 hijackers came from.  That was conveniently brushed under the rug because..well..$$ and oil.   Nothing has changed..and we will continue to forgive for sake of $$.  I guess that makes us smart.
1657 2018-10-11 20:52:45 He dey into oil & shipping. He get money scatter
1658 2018-10-11 20:52:40 Did I really need my air filter replaced or did I just get an oil change without my dad present?
1659 2018-10-11 20:52:32 This is maybe the finest example of not seeing the forest for the trees.

"A collapse in spending on oil exploration and other forms of business investment, driven by a collapse in energy prices and troubles in emerging markets, slowed growth."

Which one did Obama control?

1665 2018-10-11 20:51:35 I have a teaspoon or two as a salad (dressing) component every night. Great with “sharp” lettuces, like arugula, but dress them with olive oil first, toss, then salt, toss, then balsamic. A squeeze of fresh lemon and fresh ground black pepper.
1666 2018-10-11 20:51:25 I am dreading filling up my oil and propane tanks.   Hope we don't have another frigid winter.
1667 2018-10-11 20:51:25 I know my car needs an oil change because it’s changing gears properly like I get out of bed on time: it’s not
1668 2018-10-11 20:51:22 @ShereenBhan
If you have read my Evaluation of correlation between USD,Crude,Gold and Indian Stocks it is overall Positive.
However Crude oil below $50/barrel and above $80/barrel traverses the Indian indexes gliding graph towards the downside.
@realDonaldTrump
1669 2018-10-11 20:51:21 I responded to your comment about the oil industry. Seems like your reading comprehension is fairly low. Might be that you have a doctorate in assumptions as well.
1670 2018-10-11 20:51:15 @realDonaldTrump NEVER tells the Truth.. He’s like the Snake Oil Salesmen from years past.. Sad part is the Public hasn’t gotten any smarter when confronted by a Con-Man..#VoteBlueSaveAmericanValues
1671 2018-10-11 20:51:07 I use an essential oil. It has a lot of herbs and it puts you to sleep
1672 2018-10-11 20:51:02 Bitches who use lotion over oil can’t be trusted.. I understand a nigga being fine with dry flaky skin but come on ladies........
1673 2018-10-11 20:51:00 Why is anyone surprised? He bankrupted every single one of his businesses to include a casino. The guy is a snake oil salesman. No one in their right mind would give him any money.....except Russia. It’s why we all know the name Bob Mueller and we will all know more very soon.

1678 2018-10-11 20:50:46 I finished my oil painting still life.XD It's at school drying.
1679 2018-10-11 20:50:35 I think you're claiming me as an individual towards a mass is false. I truly support renewable energy, but when you've lived a life I have, college wasn't an option and costs too much. Oil and gas is up and many chose to rude it for the finances. Petroleum is in everything.
1680 2018-10-11 20:50:29 I read that you can clean the finish with a combo of canola or olive oil and apple cider vinegar.   Going to try this after the move with some stuff, I have a secretary desk I found an old pic of and the wood is almost tiger striped but atm the finish is so dark
1681 2018-10-11 20:50:25 So even if the know-nothing aspect of my comment wasn’t tongue-in-cheek, if one’s goal is to protect resources, I can pretty confidently say that voting against oil and mining corporations is a good rule of thumb. 3/fin
1682 2018-10-11 20:50:10 Which do you prefer? CBD oil or a CBD edible?
1683 2018-10-11 20:50:04 The truth is like oil. It always comes to the surface. He should have kept his mouth shut; but he opened it, and exposed who he is to the world.  Do not be surprised when you hear worse coming out.  At least he knows his relationship with Meghan is over.
1684 2018-10-11 20:50:04 Prayer changes things! Come on now, say it again auntie. We need the mother's of the church to POUR prayer oil over his ass. Talking about his MAGA hat makes him feel like a Super Hero. Somebody pls show him Alex Haley's Roots &  Roots 2nd Generation. Smdh
1685 2018-10-11 20:50:03 That actually was their point...they only use CBD oil and want to be an "ordinary" patient. They don't fit the stereotype that ignorant people assume and feel that the existing distribution network reinforces that stereotype.
1686 2018-10-11 20:49:59 Clearly what he's depressed about is that there will still be some oil left in the ground, that they could have made a few more billions off of, not that the earth was ending.

Coming out as a helicopter doesn't mean you need to be eating gasoline and have been sneaking cooking oil from the cabinets to live
1696 2018-10-11 20:48:06 You know you all in the oil & gas industries could try studying and applying for jobs in renewable energy instead of sticking with something you know isn’t good for the environmental or living beings. The reason they’re huge to the economy is because you guys don’t want to change

1703 2018-10-11 20:47:33 Piercing tip: during the healing process, clean the area with sea salt water but add a few drops of tea tree oil in the water as well. Shit works like magic and cuts the healing time in half!

These endless wars and "conflicts" need to end.

1706 2018-10-11 20:47:20 Yes, I suspect she’s not telling me all the details. IIRC This is the thermostat they put in when they added Central Air, prior to switching from oil to gas... that was 2001.
1707 2018-10-11 20:47:14 Why is tamanu oil soo expensive?
1708 2018-10-11 20:47:12 They should remake Armageddon but instead the oil drillers are actually drilling for oil on the asteroid.
1709 2018-10-11 20:47:04 The entire Texas Gulf Coast is in trouble. Galveston will be underwater. Houston still hasn’t recovered from Harvey & it’s flooding. There was more flooding this year. It’s a deadly situation with the oil refineries & chemical plants in the area.

1711 2018-10-11 20:46:40 Peppermint essential oil helps me every time (I get nauseated multiple times a week) - I take one drop and rub it to the roof of my mouth, I find it more effective than anything else I've ever tried (one drop = about 20 cups of peppermint tea) 
1712 2018-10-11 20:46:35 Absolutely. Society is predicated on that kind of mutual support, both in physical, nutritional sustenance and in mental enervation. The world needs writers. I'd like to think that eventually we can find greener careers for current oil riggers, though...
1713 2018-10-11 20:46:34 Nah, just rub a bit of oil into your cuticle, any oil like baby oil or even olive oil, leave it to soften a bit, then push it back with an orange wooden stick. Mrs. Stu might have one handy

1716 2018-10-11 20:46:28 Try tea tree oil. I had that happen when I first got braid. I didn’t think it was allergic reaction then but I knew it was when I got jumbo braids that hair they want you to use had my head on fire.

Saudis have bailed out both Trump and Bush businesses. That's why Obama was free to criticize KSA
1726 2018-10-11 20:45:17 @SecretaryRoss USD buys Chinese goods; not yuan. Putting USD in demand to buy globally. And it's a safe haven (thus more in demand).  If you want a week dollar, allow the world bank to make yuan a global currency. But prepare to pay what China does for oil. 7X more than now.
1727 2018-10-11 20:45:16 Because of the Money and Oil, is that okay to deal with Savage Countries?Then Why don't we deal with Iran?They have abundant oil. They held out people hostage and we stop dealing with them where as Saudi Arabian Citizens killed our people on our land on 09/11/01 and still friends

1734 2018-10-11 20:44:42 It isn’t weapons.  It is oil.  Saudi Arabia possesses huge oil reserves.
1735 2018-10-11 20:44:30 Interesting. I'd also put Todd Willens on = footing w/ Bernhardt for doing behind the scenes dirty work. & then there's Melissa Simpson, at the State now? I think? She was responsible for Safari Club Internationals partnering w/ the oil & gas industry. FYI-Sr staff is all dirty.

1749 2018-10-11 20:43:41 That’s where it itched the most too! Is that where yours itching at too? You can try tea tree oil if you absolutely don’t want to take them out.
1750 2018-10-11 20:43:41 Isn’t the US a net exporter or oil?
1751 2018-10-11 20:43:32 Coconut oil the THE best for makeup removal

1753 2018-10-11 20:43:25 Not possible! Saudi Arabia knows that they can get away with murder! Literally! Have total impunity as the world is governed by Money, Oil & Saudi contracts!& the Saudi know it! This will clarify what drives Governments! Humanity, freedom of Speach or economics, money & contracts
1754 2018-10-11 20:43:22 ok, we'll  give  don credit for this. for ethanol upgrade to l5%. too bad if local  oil don't like  it,  they can get modern and get into ethynol too.  zinke has done a thing that's good, some bad,  he's too  greedy abt gas/oil, he needs to protect the animals.
1755 2018-10-11 20:43:19 Bring me grapes..  also oil the cup bearers
1756 2018-10-11 20:43:18 No one said that. He’s saying it’s not unreasonable/elitist/negative to say NO. You’d never ask the guy at Jiffy Lube you’ve never met, just getting off his shift to show you how to change your oil and expect him to be “flattered.” Mining for intellectual property is similar
1757 2018-10-11 20:43:15 Cut his d@$k off and make him eat it... Then oil him up and lock him in a cell with some hardened criminals... then fry his ass
1758 2018-10-11 20:42:56 ...got that. The right would physically be calling for jail time due to him being a traitor.
Now Scheer goes on a tax payer funded vacation where he gives away a pipeline, according to his words, for a photo op. . . And the fat oil loving CTV host praises him.

Cons cant' govern.
1759 2018-10-11 20:42:51 @NicolleDWallace 
President can say lock her up, when Griffen holds a head and Waters says get in their faces. And Chris is so wrong about oil. US and Canada are the largest supplier.
1760 2018-10-11 20:42:48 So grateful for the blessing of these products! Each human and animal in my home are reaping the benefits! I use the thc free, Al uses the original & my cats use the Pet oil!

1762 2018-10-11 20:42:39 Yeah, understood.  I guess I just had this naive idea that if we weren't super reliant on foreign oil, and barely reliant at all on ME oil that maybe we'd have more reasonable foreign policy in the region. It was more a response to the tweet you responded to than yours.
1763 2018-10-11 20:42:38 There's your great power war.  Instead of fighting over the ownership of oil or the ownership of land or the ownership of mineral ore, they'd be fighting over the ownership of labor itself.
1764 2018-10-11 20:42:34 mixing colors in oil is fun but i have to do it properly or it gets all.. grainy
1765 2018-10-11 20:42:34 If Alberta had its oil wealth to itself for the last 30 years, our 4 million population would have almost a trillion dollars in a sovereign wealth fund ... 

Since Canada despises oil, perhaps its time to part ways and we will all be happier.

1778 2018-10-11 20:40:46 Norway can actually export oil at strong global prices to subsidize a lot of things.  Western Canada land locked thru liberal policy.   Can’t compare as Norway has not killed its export oil and gas business.

1791 2018-10-11 20:39:38 They do spend  a lot. We also support them on our dime. I have been stationed  there. They don't have the ground forces to defend themselves from an organized army. That's what I was saying. Muslim countries don't innovate much. They spend oil money.

1793 2018-10-11 20:39:30 Speaking of Pure Drop cooking oil ...where exactly are they importing that “crude oil” that they are finally packaging and feeding us? Better not to have it!!!!!!!!!! AVOID..kubhana chaiko!!!!!!

1801 2018-10-11 20:38:11 big times f. gas + oil too - lots of $$ now
1802 2018-10-11 20:38:11 One day in the future the oil will run out, until then nothing will change and infact will get worse in the later years. Nothing anyone says/tries now won't do any bit of difference at all
1803 2018-10-11 20:38:00 Oil
Brent crude fell by US$2.83 or 3.4% to US$80.26 a barrel and the US Nymex price fell by US$2.20 or 3.0% to US$70.97 a barrel.

1805 2018-10-11 20:37:45 I hate when people recommend coconut oil for anything

1807 2018-10-11 20:37:41 think im gonna dump some coconut oil on my head
1808 2018-10-11 20:37:39 it surely will come to an end 1 day, reminds me of the mad bull run b4 the military action of Nov 17, the one who manages to find suitable conditions were oil & water mix will emerge victorious, some milking big from this crisis, others will cry uncontrollably,let the dust settle
1809 2018-10-11 20:37:38 Since you have the ears of the @NGRPresident, advice him to outsmart the lot by escalating investment in the crucial sectors of the economy, chiefly education. Rather than spending on political counter-strategies, engage Nigerians directly. Oil is on the uptick, he has a leverage
1810 2018-10-11 20:37:34 Better take some time to look the information up before you go to a pole. I completed an absentee ballot and it took me 3 hours. So confusing and they put oil drilling and vaping together. WHY?
1811 2018-10-11 20:37:33 I'm sorry, but as much as I want to see the rise of renewable energy, oil and gas industries in Texas is huge towards its economy. I can't lose a job as well as many others.
1812 2018-10-11 20:37:23 countries decided to cut off the all the oil exports and gas lines to the US, which caused a supply shock and a huge shortage in energy in the US, because we supported the Israelis in the Yom Kippur war in 1973. Most of our oil comes from these states:
1813 2018-10-11 20:37:15 Everybody thinks oil will tank as it has in the past when markets sell off. I don't buy it personally & think we are just seeing imbalances coming into balance. Stocks overvalued while commodity stocks (including oil) undervalued. We lose equivalent of Iraq each year in declines.
1814 2018-10-11 20:37:05 Lol. Uh...hi...can you schedule me in for an oil change?
1815 2018-10-11 20:37:02 I dont think that Putin is a good friend of SA. I  think its the opposite. They are competitors in the oil market, they are on  opposite sites in the middle east (syria, Iran) and as far as i can remember also this russian propaganda channel RT is quiet negative about SA.
1816 2018-10-11 20:36:55 do it

1819 2018-10-11 20:36:41 I just assume I ate it at some point in the course of hanging around with people in villages where it's eaten. But I can't actually recall a specific instance. I recall something about "seal oil" but I'm not sure what -- maybe I transported some for someone...
1820 2018-10-11 20:36:32 Yes... And worthy madam can comment on #risingprices of Oil "Only".
1821 2018-10-11 20:36:27 It won’t until oil is no longer needed
1822 2018-10-11 20:36:26 Our West Texas oil fields are the focus of recent reporting that, is at best one-sided. The recently released Texas Tribune article “West Texas Becomes the Worlds Extraction Colony…” misses the mark by an oil-country mile.  No one supports pollution. To infer otherwise is false.

1884 2018-10-11 20:30:11 You’re not completely independent either. Who provides, raises, grows the food you purchase? Who provides utility services so you can light, heat or cool your home? Who drills for oil so it can be prosessed into fuel do you can get to where you want to go?
1885 2018-10-11 20:30:07 It means shifting yourself to control the way to create a conducive atmosphere to touch the Divine, light an oil lamp. People are corrupt.
1886 2018-10-11 20:30:02 Like, you don't need to know how to *do* quantum mechanics to be able to understand both why it was revolutionary and how people use it today to peddle snake oil

1895 2018-10-11 20:28:32 Must have been soap or baby oil cuz he couldn’t find the strike zone for shit! He was awful.
1896 2018-10-11 20:28:23 You're right because Norway actually owns their oil because they nationalized. We foolishly gave ours away to private corporations.

1904 2018-10-11 20:27:11 Simple answer. Yes.

More complex. He has been sponsoring a class war for so long, he just added dividing the Country in as a favorable option for those who have stock in Big Pharma and Big Oil. They will be the real winners in a Civil War.
1905 2018-10-11 20:27:08 Cdn oil prices sub $20/bbl, housing sales collapsing, stocks correcting & this is what our central bank and gov't have done:
- Hiked borrowing costs
- Hiked minimum wages
- Hiked income taxes
- Disregarded US tax cuts
- Aggressive attacked small business (who employ 8.2mm Cdns)

1910 2018-10-11 20:26:37 The United States never depended on #SaudiArabi-an oil, anyways. The US gets 12-13% of their oil/fuel/energy needs from overseas, mostly in trades in with #Canada (40%), Persian Gulf states (17%) and #Mexico (7.5%). US is now has surpassed in #SaudiArabia as the world's 
1911 2018-10-11 20:26:35 ya no shit, some Koch bro money or big oil, hell even VW money.

Sucks doing this on our own.  We don't have the fanboi e-magazines and perma-pump leaking networks.
1912 2018-10-11 20:26:35 One lesson from Norway, Oil isn’t a curse, but inept leadership is.

1914 2018-10-11 20:26:31 You can discriminate against Jews and Christians and make chattel of women, but if you produce enough oil to buy lots and lots of guns and aircract, you can get away with murder in Donald Trump's world.
1915 2018-10-11 20:26:30 I have my coffee in the morning but the rest of the day is water. I use coconut oil preworkout now and even better than a stimulant. always good stuff you put out sir.

1917 2018-10-11 20:26:19 What kind of package do you think they offer with the oil change
1918 2018-10-11 20:26:11 There are profits skimmed off at every level of such a product.  Take money from the retailer?  Transportation company?  The oil company that made the plastic possible?  Nah - having profited is in no way a form of guilt that deserves punishment.

1921 2018-10-11 20:26:08 When crude oil was $100 per barrel, what did your MCM do with it? But you expect PMB to do miracle or magic when it was $28 per barrel in 2016.the problem is that we don't read on our own, we rely on dem say dem say too much

1923 2018-10-11 20:25:50 I am presenting facts. Coal saved the forests and oil saved the whales. 
Without fossil fuels, the ecological footprint of each person alive today would be higher. Too high for the Earth to supply us.

1926 2018-10-11 20:25:45 Incorrect. CAN produces about 4 MMb/d and NO only produces 1MMb/d 
CAN has 36M people and NO has 5.2M

So we have 7X as many people but we produce 4X as much oil. They do indeed produce more per capita than us but it isn't close to 5X
Oh and they wisely nationalized their oil

1930 2018-10-11 20:25:23 I am seriously fed up with those that deny global warming. The evidence is there, right before our eyes. But those that rely on our addiction to oil to increase their wallets will do all they can to prevent us from doing anything. Plus our president is a fucking moron.
1931 2018-10-11 20:25:12 Went to Midas for a oil change and got baptized

1949 2018-10-11 20:22:50 Yes - every Australian consumes about 7 tonnes of equivalent oil to heat, cool, transport, etc. But the Govt does nothing about massive population growth. We should be exporting people to countries with lower energy consumption - instead we bring more energy guzzlers in @abcnews

1954 2018-10-11 20:22:18 The problem is not the shop folks increasing their prices... The problem is customer who chooses to buy ordinary 2 litre cooking oil for $14... What's special about cooking oil that you have to pay such a crazy amount for it? Don't blame anyone, blame yourselves
1955 2018-10-11 20:22:17 This is a healthy pullback. Fundamentals still very bullish with current global decline curve we lose the equivalent of Iraq every year. Every time we have a pullback like this it stymies upstream spending & risk taking adding to the bullish long term picture for oil.
1956 2018-10-11 20:22:09 Bio oil smell so bomb 
1957 2018-10-11 20:22:08 I agree but all these reporters like to give their opinion for some reason turkey is terrible now we don’t really need the oil anymore we have plenty of oil if we were just produce it

1969 2018-10-11 20:21:00 Congratulations BC Gov and Fed Gov. Canadian oil was $21 today. World prices were $80. The difference means a gift to the USA of around $250 million per day or about $92 BILLION annually. I'm sure USA funded enviros have more funding for next election. @ellisbross #TransMountain
1970 2018-10-11 20:21:00 We all understand the palm oil and deforestation issue, people need information on alternatives, have you ever lived in a local Village where there is no work, limited food and very limited resources? People with limited income always go for cheaper option.

1986 2018-10-11 20:19:34 Honestly CBD oil was really helping me and now I ran out and I can feel the difference but can’t afford to buy a new bottle which is JUST! GREAT!!
1987 2018-10-11 20:19:24 I absolutely agree. We need an income tax and they need to rewrite the oil tax code so that oil companies don't continue to get lavish tax credits at low oil prices. It needs to be more balanced. If they did that we would have a fully funded budget and possibly a surplus in time.
1988 2018-10-11 20:19:10 To my friends and fans I’m out for rest of year,,and when eskimo head office cares about the product  on field instead of bottom line if Eskimos,oilers did that and  have given up my oil season tickets because of it ,cheers to all

It wasn't so long ago that $60 looked like heaven. Let's wait a bit and see how much of oil's fall is momentum from equity sell-off.
1993 2018-10-11 20:18:53 What you taking fish oil?

2000 2018-10-11 20:18:26 Yeah stop eating butter on bread! Switch to olive oil and balsamic vinegar with fresh ground pepper!
2001 2018-10-11 20:18:25 Actually...only about 9% of our oil imports came from Saudi Arabia last year...and we are now the largest exporters of crude....so..no....we don’t need your oil.
2002 2018-10-11 20:18:25 Put there by the colonial British to protect the interest of the west now the best friends of America,it was the Americans from Texas who helped them build the oil industry !
2003 2018-10-11 20:18:15 honestly, how about you only talk to civilised people about what it means to slaughter a human being? Why ask savages with oil?
2004 2018-10-11 20:18:12 Let people make it their choice to stop using cooking oil. This is a crisis. Cooking pil consumed in right quantities is health. You need to say axcess consumption of cooking is not health not just saying cooking oil is not health.

2019 2018-10-11 20:16:53 setting my own paradigm aside, it's just clear the hyperbolic fear mongering over peak oil is a sham to drive up the value of oil, it is after all BP and the oil companies pushing that narrative.

2024 2018-10-11 20:16:03 Use live in conditioner. If you don’t have that use olive or coconut or carrot oil
2025 2018-10-11 20:15:58 soak it in coconut oil and then go to sleep
2026 2018-10-11 20:15:57 But they’re our friends who sell us oil, send their sons to Sandhurst and buy lots and lots of our weapons.  
2027 2018-10-11 20:15:49 A7. I co wrote Fresh Oil with @cwesioteng and the song spoke what was in my heart at this particular stage in ministry. What keeps me awake at night is the fear of complacency. So I’m constantly reminding myself to go back to God for a fresh Oil for every new task #chatwithdiana
2028 2018-10-11 20:15:45 Well done @Unilever @Dove  now if we could possibly reduce the palm oil usage....wow. Thank you from me and my rabbit Roly. Really amazing news 
2029 2018-10-11 20:15:39 This nice thing is that oil dropped too. It's currently only triple the price it was during the Obama administration.
2030 2018-10-11 20:15:33 Sorry i should have said imported oil products
2031 2018-10-11 20:15:30 yoga, laundry, showered, renewed passport, getting new Drivers License, oil change and full tank in my car.

2032 2018-10-11 20:15:27 If people are dialoguing in #Uganda, @OfwonoOpondo, what did they decide about the handling of oil? What did they decide about OTT & MM taxes? What did they decide about #agelimit? What did they agree on freedom of expression vis-a-vis what's being done by da state? #NBSFrontline
2033 2018-10-11 20:15:26 Season with salt and pepper, serve with roasted pumpkin seeds (you can oil and salt these and roast them along with the pumpkin), really good hot sauce, and chopped spring onions.
2034 2018-10-11 20:15:25 Kilkers. It's tradition of AlSaud rooted from wahaby kingdom founders. Now US protecting  them until they finish milking residual oil. Soon you will face ICC
2035 2018-10-11 20:15:22 taking a oil supplement and constantly burping the taste of it <<<<<< im ready to die.

2042 2018-10-11 20:13:32 Milo and sugar with sardine oil
2043 2018-10-11 20:13:27 This is not true, Saudi Arabia protects its national security and protects its economy, which provides the world with the basics of life. Imagine America without oil How will it live?

2052 2018-10-11 20:12:15 Agree, but demand is not set in stone either, although I expect higher oil prices to help. I'm in the $10,000 LCE camp for now.
2053 2018-10-11 20:12:15 Do you have any Lavender essential oil ? A drop of that works well for relieving the pain of stings.

2056 2018-10-11 20:11:59 What's your point? And you think Nigeria's oil is the only source of revenue to the country?

2060 2018-10-11 20:11:34 Pardon Mark Rich he made billion by selling Iran oil during embargo 
Then receive 13 million for pardon.
Put together 154 billion cash deal to Iran,the Clinton foundation gets 240 million from Iran seem like a lot of $  from Iran

2066 2018-10-11 20:10:45 Yea any illegal upper use just goes without being said oil field is 24/7 buhddy
2067 2018-10-11 20:10:43 It's a sign of the times. Police cannot investigate crimes with good evidence but cause a disturbance to powerful profit making companies and down you go. The oil must flow reguardless of environmental cost

2077 2018-10-11 20:09:51 Atiku Abubakar is still better than Mr Lifeless
2078 2018-10-11 20:09:47 i feel like my car is gonna fall apart all at once bc the only maintenance that i’ve done to it is an oil change lmao
2079 2018-10-11 20:09:18 While there are oil wells, coal mines, there are no hydrogen wells. Can generation of hydrogen be powered by hydrogen itself in a sustained reaction? Is it efficient to extract such that sufficient energy is produced to make it economical? can it be done on grass roots level?
2080 2018-10-11 20:09:17 GDP is an ill way to measure economy as a whole.
You cut every tree there is, you pump last drop of oil and you'll end up with GDP  never seen before.
How about next year?
2081 2018-10-11 20:09:12 40 years? 
This started with FDR and the seven sisters....it was part of the deal made at the end of WWII. We will give you oil, you stay out of our affairs....
2082 2018-10-11 20:08:50 Royal Oil
2083 2018-10-11 20:08:46 It’s a courgette and it makes a basis for a really good curry or you can just dust it with flour, cumin and salt and fry it in olive oil.
2084 2018-10-11 20:08:43 Can you find a major oil company that is against the carbon theory publicly? Yet there gov lobbying does not say the same message.
2085 2018-10-11 20:08:28 Our global commitment is to be sustainably sourced by 2020 on our 10 main ingredient categories. The 1st to achieve this is our palm oil, with 100% responsible sourcing reached in 2015. Our commitment is to stay 100% responsible for years to come :) Thank you for asking!
2086 2018-10-11 20:08:27 Judge who jailed fracking protesters with 'excessive' sentence has family links to oil and gas firmhttp://abbeyshop.website/2018/10/11/judge-who-jailed-fracking-protesters-with-excessive-sentence-has-family-links-to-oil-and-gas-firm-12/http://abbeyshop.website/2018/10/11/judge...
2087 2018-10-11 20:08:26 Oil riggers as a job have existed for maybe 70 years. Fiction writers? Over 2000 years as a profession and still going strong...
2088 2018-10-11 20:08:25 Policy. We have to start by conceding that fossil fuels (in particular oil and natural gas) are very good energy sources. Also we have to understand energy transitions have been slow and are getting slower. So we'll depend on FF for many decades in the future.
2089 2018-10-11 20:08:24 Edikan Ikong does that shit.
Warm it the next day with Palm Oil. Skrrrrrr.....
2090 2018-10-11 20:08:19 Nothing is invincible. He diverted our attention from oil to Agriculture and now the farmers are happy. We now eat some of what we produce and for me, that's a superlative step.
2091 2018-10-11 20:08:17 Oooh I had sliced potatoes with some olive oil and salt and pepper in the oven. Was a lovely compliment!
2092 2018-10-11 20:08:16 IDK why anyone pays to get their oil changed lol
2093 2018-10-11 20:08:08 The GOP will only notice Green Energy as a better energy source if Green Energy companies bribed them with more money than Big Oil.
2094 2018-10-11 20:08:08 Yeah it probably would be a worthwhile investment to get one of those fancy electric ones.
I will keep the baby oil in mind just in case I ever want to try it.
2095 2018-10-11 20:08:07 Got two products with eucalyptus oil and i don't know wtf type of oil it is.
2096 2018-10-11 20:08:06 Car note oil change tires kilt me 
2097 2018-10-11 20:08:04 Try CBD oil bruh
2098 2018-10-11 20:08:03 Rand Paul's fellow Rapepublicans killed about a million people in Iraq for oil companies.
2099 2018-10-11 20:07:50 Clever way to get a follow....

(I tried to avoid it so I only had to see half the bickering)
2100 2018-10-11 20:07:44 Ok fine I admit it's my fault oil companies knew the ramnifications of continued use of petroleum and still did nothing during the seventies even though I was born in the 90s
2101 2018-10-11 20:07:43 8 ghost people appointed into governing boards of agencies and parastatals 

18 ghost companies lifted ₦1.1 trillion crude oil in 10 months 

Buhari has made corruption a minor evil
2102 2018-10-11 20:07:29 Dear @FT the country is in civil war. That mad guy #PaulBiya declared war against the anglophones in #SouthernCameroons because his french advisors told him to keep the control over the oil fields there. Now he completely destabilized the  country with this stupid decision.
2103 2018-10-11 20:07:22 Does beard oil really help ur beard grow?
2104 2018-10-11 20:07:17 Agree but we need their oil. Turkey just as bad. Nevertheless, wish Shep could just report the news, as his hour is supposed to be “news”.
2105 2018-10-11 20:07:10 Lick palm oil.
2106 2018-10-11 20:06:49 Wash yo hair every 4 days, all the oil that builds up on your scalp helps it grow too

2108 2018-10-11 20:06:26 Nyet, nyet. Just humble leader of a once-mighty put upon country with an aging and shrinking population on far too much land, and a few oil wells, ICBMs, and unlike you Amerikanskis, a manned space program.
2109 2018-10-11 20:06:20 Omg i love talking to you
2110 2018-10-11 20:06:10 The entire Oil & Gas industry has been managed by the UK gov since inception. If it isn't making enough revenue, you know who to blame.
Scotland is a world leader in renewables. rUK isn't.
I'm sure I'm not alone when I say I don't have a clue what you're dribbling about.
2111 2018-10-11 20:06:03 I don't think at that moment until I drink Palm oil.
That's me! I rarely get angry tho
2112 2018-10-11 20:06:02 Funny enough you can cook A LOT of stuff without oil. Chicken, mince, steak etc...

2117 2018-10-11 20:05:34 Fuck, really no handler told him not to answer questions about the nation that inflates the current value of our dollar by only using us currency for oil
2118 2018-10-11 20:05:26 this ingredients list is divine but maybe even better with the addition of flavoured oil (but can't decide which flavour) and a portion of garlic sauteed potatoes.  Off to bed feeling hungry now!!
2119 2018-10-11 20:05:15 I think your 10-yr oil chart is still accurate and that big drop due in June is starting now, the Jan/Feb drop was a blip.
2120 2018-10-11 20:05:12 Would certainly be interesting to see how much oil revenue was made during this 'collapse'. Do you have any figures?
2121 2018-10-11 20:05:05 So glad I can watch Dr. Phil while waiting to get my oil changed.
2122 2018-10-11 20:04:52 Petrol queue 
Cooking oil queue  
What a day.
2123 2018-10-11 20:04:38 Read today we have to cut our meat consumption by 90% for the environment's. You know what else puts a toll on the environment ? Having kids (trash gets multiplied, diapers, spoiled food, etc.), having a car (gas, oil and plastics pollution), individualism (as in North America)
2124 2018-10-11 20:04:34 Schumer: "If we did more on climate change, we’d have fewer of these hurricanes and other types of storms."
Why won’t they admit the truth? Maybe there are two words that explain it: oil industry."

Wrong Chuck!  The two words are "it's bullsh*t."
2125 2018-10-11 20:04:17 - don’t go to sleep with your makeup on, obviously!!
- wash your brushes with olive oil and dish soap!
- exfoliating your lips with vaseline + sugar gives you hella soft lips before applying lip products!!
2126 2018-10-11 20:04:06 I thought so as well... I took one similar last year and since it was raining today I tried it again. I love the effect! A photographer did something similar the other day and that's what I told him... looked like an oil painting
2127 2018-10-11 20:03:45 Boiled in oil would be too good for him and add a bitta Noirin for extra flavour!
2128 2018-10-11 20:03:44 It just proves you lack imagination and have no sense of observation: taxing things, like oil, is how you get people to think twice about buying them.
2129 2018-10-11 20:03:37 My thoughts are that Iran has the educated scientists to develop a nuclear system, the Wahhabi been paid enough for their oil that they want to pay someone to install a nuclear system.
I have a pathetic interest in trying to stay on good terms with the smart folk.
2130 2018-10-11 20:03:37 fill your horn with oil and be on your way; I am sending you to Jesse of Bethlehem.I have chosen one of his sons to be king
2131 2018-10-11 20:03:30 Also, their economic woes have much more to do with the price of crude oil and petrodollars than socialism.
2132 2018-10-11 20:03:29 Aaaa Mkoma Nigel! it started with petrol. then cooking oil, Soap, then Cement, meanwhile the market is anticipating- just a few days before pay dates- let face reality and say something has come upon our nation
2133 2018-10-11 20:03:15 Keep bringing the #boom and drinking our great snake oil....I mean our energy providing keto coffee!!!  With your hard work I can continue to live on my own private island and wipe my ass with $100 bills!!  Thank you and keep tricking people into buying worthless crap!!
2134 2018-10-11 20:02:57 Ok i get it. but is it a good brand that a cbd oil / lotion company would use for their company? Like I touched on earlier I would look at other cbd oil and cream companies. see what types of names they're selecting.
2135 2018-10-11 20:02:56 Does it matter that they shamelessly produce every barrel of oil they can?  They have 5x the oil production per capita as Canada. Feels hypocritical of you to highlight, no?
2136 2018-10-11 20:02:55 A huge number of men in Alberta commited suicide right around the time of that downturn. 
Families were dependent on that industry. Also, continue to ignore the massive amounts of tax those oil industry workers paid into this welfare system.
2137 2018-10-11 20:02:46 If you buy weapons and have oil that is
2138 2018-10-11 20:02:45 Jetter cycle is still secret. It produces 270.2 TJ per kg with no radionuclide waste. It builds H bomb and still secret. Sherwood project succeeded and AEC chair said power too cheap to meter by 1970. Then demonised and reclassified by Eisenhower energy council run by oil execs.
2139 2018-10-11 20:02:42 Victoria is only one state in a country which contributes 1.3-1.8% emissions. However, in Australia, we’ll also need to stop deforestation. Stop any new CSG & oil drilling. Transition AWAY from gas (as bad as coal), and stop population growth - Australia has highest pc emissions.
2140 2018-10-11 20:02:39 Mr Lifeless is the number Joker with our Unity, he have divided Nigeria more than any past leader. 97%/5%

2147 2018-10-11 20:01:54 Dear @FT that guy is close to winter. In his 36 year rule he achieved  to steal more than $20billion from oil revenues. Used it for his family, friends and patronage network. The country will fall apart after him because of his failed state building and mean tribalism.
2148 2018-10-11 20:01:50 BECAUSE OF COURSE HE GODDAMN DOES. Don't say 'well well well', Kev, he'll think there's three more oil sources he can profiteer off, and won't see who he's jailing for his erection!

Just another fat cat arse on the Gravy Train. No #Austerity for YOU, M'Lud? CHOO CHOO, EH WHAT?!
2149 2018-10-11 20:01:44 Somebody had one last week Friday in theatre workshop and is broughtupsy that stop meh from feeding it to make a oil dong.
2150 2018-10-11 20:01:41 @MySoccerAfrica The pastor is 100% - FIFA and government is like water and oil in terms of running futball matters
2151 2018-10-11 20:01:40 Do you think that people would be so keen to use argan oil if they knew that traditionally the oil is from the kernels eaten by goats and collected in their droppings?
2152 2018-10-11 20:01:32 What is MCT Oil powder  “MCTs” are medium-chain triglycerides, a form of saturated fatty acid that has numerous health benefits, ranging from improved cognitive function to better weight management.
2153 2018-10-11 20:01:31 It’s ok to get help. Don’t beat yourself up.  I started taking CBD oil to help with my anxiety/depression that I’m now dealing with.
2154 2018-10-11 20:01:27 Its amazing what the West will overlook in exchange for oil and the sale of arms.
2155 2018-10-11 20:01:26 This is why you gotta bring your own oil so they just charge you like 30 sum dollars
2156 2018-10-11 20:01:25 we have enough oil in reserve today to outlast our natural lifetimes alone, not to mention newly accessible, and undiscovered reserves. We aren't anywhere close to running out.
2157 2018-10-11 20:01:21 You know one of the problem PMB had with OBJ is that oil well palava, Americana Atikulated man would have promise him a deal. And Atiku must have promise CBN well resume payment of Ota farm workers salary. Ole well always be thief
2158 2018-10-11 20:01:19 The recent Growth commission from the snp admitted that vital services for an independent Scotland were based on revenue from oil. That’s some admission. Indy’s not for me, Scotland job wise is booming. I’m not going to jeopardise that im afraid.
2159 2018-10-11 20:01:09 Yes let’s go oil shopping
2160 2018-10-11 20:01:02 They are supporting this barbaric regime of Alsaud for the oil dollars  they buy American & other European government simple.

Always ride wit da canvas
2166 2018-10-11 20:00:25 I know all about the organic and unrefined I just never knew about avoiding it during the winter. I always felt like the castor oil made my hair hard but maybe it was the coconut oil this whole time
2167 2018-10-11 20:00:24 You were sold snake oil by a great salesman.
2168 2018-10-11 20:00:22 if you believe that I have a dried up oil field to sell you
2169 2018-10-11 20:00:20 If I'm understanding the subtly of his points, people only need food, shelter, and clothing to survive and the way to get those things is to pump oil and turn it into those things. Genius.
2170 2018-10-11 20:00:16 จึก...หลานฉันเติบโตมาอย่างดี ต่อให้ปลายทางจะรักหรือไม่รัก ทำไมนะทำไมหลานฉันต้องมาเจ็บปวดเพราะคนพวกนี้ บีน่าของป้า ไอ้อลัน... #ฟิคช่างตัดเสื้อ
2171 2018-10-11 20:00:04 That's the pseudoscience, there is no end to oil in sight, estimates of peak oil, and subsequent depletion are ill informed oversimplifications of the reality at hand, as drilling technology improves, more and more oil is discovered and harvested.
2172 2018-10-11 20:00:00 Because oil and $$$
2173 2018-10-11 20:00:00 How long do I leave the oil in my hair?
2174 2018-10-11 19:59:49 I buy the Cedar and Mint soap from Esther's site. It is wonderful, organic and no palm oil.
2175 2018-10-11 19:59:49 lemme pour a bottle of oil on my head then real quick
2176 2018-10-11 19:59:39 Another quick tip: baby oil. If you want super soft legs, grab a bottle of that. 10/10
2177 2018-10-11 19:59:33 I would them fight to the death against each other first. Nothing like making someone kill their own buddy to set a tone

Then I would throw the victor in a pit containing a 100 starving chihuahuas, with his hands and found bound and covered in tuna oil.
2178 2018-10-11 19:59:18 @beechloren02 castor oil or coconut oil helps hair grow so use it on your brows sis p.s. dont use too much because it can clog pores and cause acne. ilY
2179 2018-10-11 19:59:15 Houston is poppin’ and it has cheap rent! Get a transfer Jen in the crude oil/energy division or PE sector at your company.
2180 2018-10-11 19:59:14 Olbas Oil? 
2181 2018-10-11 19:59:03 I've never done it with coconut oil I'll have to remember that trick... it's funny that the stylist was the first one to fry it. That's why I don't go to salons lol
2182 2018-10-11 19:59:01 Just to clarify since my last tweet was vague. It’s good that people are doing their bit and I fully support that. My point was not all the blame should be on us. A lot should be with big oil who deny climate change, because taking action would cut into their profit margins.
2183 2018-10-11 19:58:53 "I need to go shopping" lentils: three onions, four cloves garlic, tomato basil sauce, red pepper, lentils, water. oil added at the last minute containing garam masala, curry powder, turmeric. I will let you know when the rice is done.
2184 2018-10-11 19:58:49 Maybe try a dab of olive or vegetable oil?
2185 2018-10-11 19:58:45 One minute after he loses the 2020 election a few million will do so. As will all the grifters like Candace Owen, who just ride the prevailing winds in order to shill snake oil
2186 2018-10-11 19:58:40 I remember “Your Modi” telling that “If my luck bring crude oil prices down, y u bring other” before Delhi elections!!!!!
Now will u speak up ?
2187 2018-10-11 19:58:37 animehater27 is so fat, if someone would melt her down, they'd have enough oil to power Detroit for a month!

2191 2018-10-11 19:58:20 Good,we can then close this chapter of threats & give our money to people who appreciate it. I hope we also stop insisting on selling our oil in dollars & see the free downfall of the currency. We stand with our allies but an unsubstantiated accusation they turn their backs on us
2192 2018-10-11 19:58:01 @selenagomez also try cbd oil derived from hemp. Dont do cannabis version, might be too stuimulant and exaberate anxiety.
2193 2018-10-11 19:57:59 pro tip, You should definitely change your oil
2194 2018-10-11 19:57:59 Good,we can then close this chapter of threats & give our money to people who appreciate it. I hope we also stop insisting on selling our oil in dollars & see the free downfall of the currency. We stand with our allies but an unsubstantiated accusation they turn their backs on us
2195 2018-10-11 19:57:48 Neither did Maxine Waters and Cory Booker huh? Your mobs are already attacking people and all you do is pour oil on the fire.
2196 2018-10-11 19:57:46 Before bed you got to oil your face just incase mama decides to sit on your face 
2197 2018-10-11 19:57:43 See ancient man, mentioning phones as achievement buh wat abt power supply n our own oil
2198 2018-10-11 19:57:42 Bcoz they want Saudis oil.
2199 2018-10-11 19:57:41 Make sure the CBD oil you're using doesn't contain THC. A lot of companies keep THC in their CBD oils, but if you're lucky it will be a small trace. Next time you buy a keep an eye out on all of the ingredients in your CBD oil 
2200 2018-10-11 19:57:40 Hay quien dice que va haber déficit de petróleo pesado por temas de como están montadas las refinerias. El West Texas es distinto, es como el Brent, oil ligero y poco azufre.
2201 2018-10-11 19:57:28 Or like your a snake oil salesman.
2202 2018-10-11 19:57:27 Make sure to wash that pie down with a Big-Gulp full of oil.

2203 2018-10-11 19:57:26 We have crude oil for $26/barrel? Could that influence our price of gasoline?
2204 2018-10-11 19:56:53 Surprisingly, I bleached my hair A LOT before I let my stylist have at it. But I didn't destroy my hair nearly as badly as she did, because I always bleach over coconut oil. She just throws the bleach on.
2205 2018-10-11 19:56:41 @Milka_Spain  I like milka chocolate but notice palm oil in the list of ingredients. Could you tell me if that's sustainable palm oil please? It doesn't say on the packaging.
2206 2018-10-11 19:56:37 he’s a corporate tool that’s turning over Canada to big business, signed on for America’s war on drugs, and has been forcibly removing indigenous people for oil. but at least he uses the right pronouns!
2207 2018-10-11 19:56:34 Getting my oil changed rn & the service tech came in the waiting room saying, “Juan! Honda Pilot! Juan?! Okay... TWO? TWO?!?!” I hate white people lmfao
2208 2018-10-11 19:56:22 Just gone to book 10 000 oil change and software update on my 5 month old Discovery and told first available day is 10th Dec urm not the best start to my 10th Landrover life 
2209 2018-10-11 19:56:18 You buy better armor for  henchmen or flasks of oil or a stonemason to help you reinforce the walls of your castle.
2210 2018-10-11 19:56:14 tell me why the hell bookkeeping is easier for me than oil field terminology.
2211 2018-10-11 19:55:49 @realDonaldTrump The price of gas is going way up because of your war with Iran and the rising price of oil. The stock market is losing money because of your trade war with China. And now you want to raise the price of stamps from 50 to 55 cents. Trump--Making America Poor Again.
2212 2018-10-11 19:55:39 If you want to fix the problem, then fix it.

A modern nuclear plant replaces 5-10 million barrels of oil.  Build 10, perhaps 6 in northern BC/Prairies for the oilfield, another 4 wherever the projected energy demand is greatest.j  That's 75 megatonnes of CO2.

2217 2018-10-11 19:55:10 Needed more than ever? The average person can’t afford electric cars even with subsidies. Where does the electricity come to charge the cars? Definitely not unicorn farts. Oil. Gas. Coal. Hydro. All things being opposed by people with their heads in the sand.

2219 2018-10-11 19:54:57 I receive it in JESUS NAME! Fresh oil! To get the great I let go of the good in JESUS NAME!
2220 2018-10-11 19:54:54 Crash or no crash we've got a lot more to offer than just oil, I'm confident we'd have been ok.

2225 2018-10-11 19:54:10 At the moment the rest of the UK is subsidising Scotland, as oil revenues have dropped in recent years. Scotland is no longer self sufficient, as it once was.
2226 2018-10-11 19:54:08 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

2228 2018-10-11 19:53:56 Last week my hot-dog buns were too dry because I didn't put in enough oil.

I overcompensated...

Never made this mistake with buns before (pizza dough yeah, not hot-dog or hamburger buns) so I'm interested to see what happens!

2230 2018-10-11 19:53:50 Canada has low grade oil that is expensive to transport and refine. Why wouldn't it be discounted... I know.... justin.
2231 2018-10-11 19:53:40 Arable is an issue is when it is monoculture for cattle feed growth for factory farming, and palm oil in Indonesia. If we stop growing crops to feed captive animals, and feed ppl instead, we need less land. And use less water, produce less waste& kill less. Better 4 environment
2232 2018-10-11 19:53:37 Leave all these terrorists to be showing themselves

2238 2018-10-11 19:52:34 How much more evidence do you need that people aren't comfortable giving climate money to people who triple debt, keep slush funds, pillage Haiti, have ISIS run oil for them, etc.?
2239 2018-10-11 19:52:30 My order will be going in for  cannabis oil - I'll try anything now, not for recreation, but medical!!
2240 2018-10-11 19:52:29 Is he selling snake oil again?  Flushing your money will accomplish the same thing.  Schumer will say anything to get money!
2241 2018-10-11 19:52:29 I so wish marijuana was legal here though I think I would need a hell of a dose. I am thinking about trying the cbd oil. It’s so damn expensive though. I have to spend more than that on my meds in case it doesn’t work 
2242 2018-10-11 19:52:25 MBS will (might?) understand something only when his money is rejected. Let's see is anyone rejects the psychopath's oil money
2243 2018-10-11 19:52:24 So we’re going to sanction Saudi oil exports using the #MagnitskyAct and shoot prices through the roof...that sounds likely

What a bunch of deluded fuckwits!
2249 2018-10-11 19:51:58 We’ll never know how it would effect us mate. Many still think Scotland don’t need to reply solely on the oil. Either way it’s all just opinions, no one can say for sure on either side how better or worse we would be right now.

2265 2018-10-11 19:49:54 Don't change the Maritime Transport Act 1994, @jamespeshaw - an instant end to oil exploration is an ideal response to the IPCC report.
2266 2018-10-11 19:49:50 Why are cars so expensive: car note, insurance, gas, oil change, new tires .... now the check engine light is on 
2267 2018-10-11 19:49:49 I’m about to do that bc my tea tree oil is not taking away my  acne scars at all
2268 2018-10-11 19:49:42 There are too many alternatives to "imed" to pair with cbd. I'd not say it's likely not a brand that a cbd oil company is going to select for their company. Look at other cbd oil and cream companies. see what types of names they're selecting. go for those.  Good luck!

2271 2018-10-11 19:49:31 "I don't use foxfire or chrome, I just use google" is a phrase I hear too often, while mindspark is default home/search. Granted companies re-branding themselves as often as an oil change doesn't help.
2272 2018-10-11 19:49:24 Taking your dog to the vet is literally like taking your car for an oil change...except it’s your dog so you feel obligated to do all the extra shit
2273 2018-10-11 19:49:23 Try Japanese mayo or freshly made aioli. None of that pre packaged stuff. Mayo=oil and egg lol
2274 2018-10-11 19:49:20 If you are in a state where it is legal, low dose edibles help a lot, as does cbd oil. I dont k ow about the cold liquid thing, that sounds rough.  Just try to stay positive. This is an endurance battle of wills, positivity, visualization, purpose: these are the best weapons. 
2275 2018-10-11 19:49:15 Potato in it’s skin with olive oil and rosemary and pepper. In oven or microwave. Always saves me when hungry and lazy

2278 2018-10-11 19:48:56 I'm wondering; who's that person who thought, "I need to design a package for akabanga chilly oil... I think I'll make it look like eye-drops..." 
2279 2018-10-11 19:48:50 no one will ever be able to convince me that them wax pens or thc oil cartridges gon be better than me breaking down some weed n rolling it

2281 2018-10-11 19:48:31 As well, Venezuela (Put-in has disrupted their country) has more reserves than saudi arabia (as of 2012/3) and expects it will last 49-50 years. Saudi's to last 47 years though they say 90. No oil is potentially in many's future.
2282 2018-10-11 19:48:30 This coconut oil every cunt is using just makes everything taste like coconut, so why spend a fortune on food like a fillet steak and fry it in coconut oil, might as well buy a fucking bounty! #rats #coconutfuckingeverything

2285 2018-10-11 19:48:14 castor oil or massage scalp with warm oil , mix eggs and olive oil together and apply to dry hair, even when you don’t shampoo, always put a little conditioner & comb your hair out.
2286 2018-10-11 19:48:12 so im upset because i thought i had oil pastel, but i don't.
2287 2018-10-11 19:47:58 Go back and look at the unemployment rates from similar drops in oil prices, you'll see the same thing.

2291 2018-10-11 19:47:47 I know ion even use baby oil for my goochy  I just hope her cooch is ok! Like why not just use spit?
2292 2018-10-11 19:47:43 WCS traded at WTI - $52.50 USD today..  Canada is selling oil for less than $20 USD / bbl and no mention of it by @CBCNews @CBCCalgary @calgaryherald @financialpost and no action by @RachelNotley or @JustinTrudeau.
2293 2018-10-11 19:47:39 If yes had won in 2014 followed by oil collapse I dread to think where we’d be as a nation.
2294 2018-10-11 19:47:37 Why don’t you use all your dirty oil money and just buy coverage for all Alaskans? Oh wait, the companies are making billions and the state thousands.... ahhh never mind
2295 2018-10-11 19:47:35 Comparison … link out to an article comparing a Spanish and Italian food product - the Spanish product has palm oil removed. Student includes a link to an article explaining why. #NERALLT Thinglink
2296 2018-10-11 19:47:33 Interesting divergence between oil and gold today. And feels like ages since when gold had such a strong day
2297 2018-10-11 19:47:07 Very sensible young Kyle, I might even forget to mention ever again (after this) that engines need oil in them? 
2298 2018-10-11 19:47:03 Or how much it would cost to see the Oil if Edmonton didn't partner with them?

Спасибо, я послушаю обязательно
2300 2018-10-11 19:46:52 Thank you, queen.  
Honestly, two-strand twists using the LOC method has always been my go to. Preferably Sheamoisture for the cream/ coconut for oil. 
2301 2018-10-11 19:46:50 My mom told me spinach ravioli was too fattening because of the olive oil but she’s literally right next to me frying potstickers with oil..
2302 2018-10-11 19:46:49 @AliVelshi There is a difference… In the old days we needed the Saudis to provide us with oil. We no longer need their oil, we no longer have a military base on their territory, and so the power in the relationship has shifted. They need us more than we need them
2303 2018-10-11 19:46:39 Endangered?The likes of Collins?No, they’ve always been here!Suck-up to get votes no matter the cost! They get just enough from the un-educated (my family always votes republican)and unvoting public to stay relevant...there’s the GOP snake oil salesmen. Collins is not moderate!
2304 2018-10-11 19:46:34 Scored bores on cylinders five and six. Burns oil like a bastard, rattles like a, well a rattle and requires a £15k rebuild. 

Worse than heartbreak all day long.
2305 2018-10-11 19:46:22 Taking oregano oil daily. 

Lots of scratchy throats and coughs at my job. Lots of folks feeling run down. 

Figured it had something to do with the hurricanes mixing up the air.
2306 2018-10-11 19:46:17 But if your looking for something for hair growth try their oil. A cheaper option also is Wild growth hair oil they sell that in any hair store.
2307 2018-10-11 19:46:10 After Everest, they bring up crude oil. Seriously shut the fvck1ng up, this acc should be for fun.

2315 2018-10-11 19:45:32 I need to get some oil my hair dry as a bitch
2316 2018-10-11 19:45:29 Actually just read the U.S is now number one in world oil production. Time to stop exporting it and flood the market. You imagine what would happen if gas got below $2 a gallon?
2317 2018-10-11 19:45:08 The best of the new stuff I've had from M&S is the @BearRepublic Racer 5. Top class. They also have some good stuff from @MikkellerBeer - check out Hair in the Mailbox - and Beavertown is still pretty good - Neck Oil is one of my faves. 
2318 2018-10-11 19:45:06 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

2322 2018-10-11 19:44:36 How quickly did the atomic bomb go from theory to being dropped?  Fast.
This country can do anything if there is an imperative, and there is.
Too bad we'll do nothing.  We had a shot in the 80's and big oil squashed it.
2323 2018-10-11 19:44:29 random thought - can i throw a flash of oil onto an enemy and make them burn even harder?
2324 2018-10-11 19:44:28 Y’all still putting coconut oil on ur face? Interesting
2325 2018-10-11 19:44:27 Your swearing will no doubt wound many of those blue collar oil riggers who have never heard such things.
2326 2018-10-11 19:44:23 You had a oil change and all your fluids changed recently?
2327 2018-10-11 19:44:22 What about oil?
2328 2018-10-11 19:44:10 The struggle is real rn bc I done put too much damn oil in my hair to straighten it and now I gotta re wash it
2329 2018-10-11 19:44:10 Republicans have a vested interest in not fixing climate change. Big oil is winning. Putin also wants the Arctic to melt. It's part of his strategic plan.

2332 2018-10-11 19:43:56 Instead of govt buying oil why not free up the sector by allowing private companies to buy, sell and market the oil in India from around the world? Flat tax; no tariff and let the competition begin to capture the Oil market of India.
2333 2018-10-11 19:43:01 99.9% of climate scientists agree temperatures of earth due to greenhouse gas is increasing and sea levels are rising. You can find differing reports usually funded by oil and gas companies. Hopefully I’ll be dead in 40 years so I’ll just do my little part.
2334 2018-10-11 19:42:58 my prof brought her oil diffuser to class what is going on
2335 2018-10-11 19:42:57 Gas is rising because of trumps sanctions on Iran. He wants zero exports from Iran and is asking opec to pick it up. Problem is that opec cant. So oil will soon be over $100 a barrel due to trumps war with Iran. Food prices are rising because of trumps terriffs.
2336 2018-10-11 19:42:52 SA has never been our friend. The Bushes have had an ongoing relationship for a long time based on oil.
In fact, “W” ripped off a Bin Laden for multi millions with Harken, his oil company that bankrupted yet W made millions.
Maybe Bin Laden held a grudge.
2337 2018-10-11 19:42:50 How about we just stop buying oil from those snakes, can't we just starve them out?

Something has to be done,until you can get term limits & big money out of politics, not sure how. Hell,Corey Booker is a whore for Big Pharma that kept cheap meds out of the US
2351 2018-10-11 19:40:46 Does @LouisFarrakhan claim to be the Messiah? Or was that ironic? I could be persuaded to pour oil over his head, preferably, crude oil lol...

2354 2018-10-11 19:40:33 Okay guys this jimin thing is concerning, but an old man that famous as ex economy ministry just said crude oil is 10$ / barrel & i will have to tell u that if u wanna be rich, INVEST ALL OF UR MONEY WHEN CRUDE OIL REACH <20$ which could happen when unicorns is available at zoos

It is much better option than having 80% die

If your travels take you to serviced apartments/AirBNBs, and you like cooking your own meals — but you also can’t carry oil around because seriously who can — just buy bacon and heat it up.
2401 2018-10-11 19:36:15 Soybeans are a commodity, like oil. The worldwide demand doesn’t change. If a area bought Brazilian beans before China, they can get them from another place, such as the USA.

2404 2018-10-11 19:36:03 I agree you’ve handed back more to the rich but the arguments in favour of the poor aren’t baseless.

Plus the rich dude probably works in oil anyway. So screw him.

2409 2018-10-11 19:35:17 Barrel of oil is currently $89. So the government of Nigeria is currently rich. Oil is a curse to Nigeria. The same oil developed UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia Etc. But destroyed Nigeria. Na wa o @rollybello
2410 2018-10-11 19:35:08 yeah i personally cant wait till the 100 massive oil companies and coal producers who are responsible for 71% of the global carbon emissions go cruelty free and save the planet
2411 2018-10-11 19:34:58 Most of us will be alive when this happens 
and in next 10-20 years choises will be made from mass genocide to destroying all oil and oil usage becomes illegal and coal too and i think it will go so far that that anyone seen digging oil will be killed

2431 2018-10-11 19:33:24 Who wants to work at a place with such miserable people, god that would be depressing. Anger, dismay and grief are all negative emotions, makes for a very toxic environment.
2432 2018-10-11 19:33:21 Have you tried CBD oil? It will also help if you have any pain from inflammation. I’ve been using it for months now & have great, deep sleeps!

2445 2018-10-11 19:31:53 Yes very sad. Each hateful word, each ounce of oil burned, each infringement on   our rights: voter ID, stop and frisk, state park shrinkage, aquitted police, bad mouthing companies  causing stock price ticks, is a threat to our freedom. You people have short memories
2446 2018-10-11 19:31:51 Hi again - all Girl Guide Cookie ingredients confirm to Health Canada regulations. We have reduced the amount of hydrogenated palm kernel oil in our products and will continue to seek reductions that allow us to maintain the high quality of our cookie.
2447 2018-10-11 19:31:51 Climate change is real. We were always going to go with green or alternative not because of Climate change but because of the energy crisis. We're running out on Fuels to burn literally. I presume part of the reasons big oil giants started "losing" legal battles against climate
2448 2018-10-11 19:31:47 @nailogical what was the type of nail oil you use?  I remember it was very basic and you put it in your own dispensers but that's about it. PLZ Help my nailssssssssss

2452 2018-10-11 19:31:16 Just listen to yourself, which bad policy do you refer to? What will Atiku do to stop a contracting economy from crude shock? Does Atiku determine crude oil price? pls sound educated for once.
2453 2018-10-11 19:31:14 I think so too just because we are just gonna magically stop drilling for oil and gas... not gonna stop destroying forests for profit. Even if we everyday citizens do our part. The Ink Is Dry - 3EyedRaven

2465 2018-10-11 19:30:01 They are probably rubbing out anyone who cries for ecological conservation in Latin America, hence the calls to ban members from entering their countries. The cola, palm oil and beef mafias there are too strong. Gotta learn how to say NO to that blood money.
2466 2018-10-11 19:29:58 AAAHJAA I needed an oil change so I go to an oil change place, park, see workers staring at me from afar. Moments later one approaches me, I roll down my window: 
“Are you here for an oil change?”
me: “no” *drives away*

I will now go to another oil change place
2467 2018-10-11 19:29:53 It’s easy to make and it has a very high smoke point so you can use it in place of oil without burning or browning it
2468 2018-10-11 19:29:44 If you haven’t struck oil after 70 seconds, stop boring 
2469 2018-10-11 19:29:44 Full tank of gas and an oil change. Who tryna race ?

2471 2018-10-11 19:29:24 In the next decade fossil fuel companies are going to spend over 2 trillion dollars on coal, oil, & gas projects.

That money should be spent on developing renewable energy infrastructure and technology that reverses climate change. 

But it won’t. Because capitalism.
2472 2018-10-11 19:29:16 Tesla is noted for its electric cars but the most significant development may be in energy storage.  This will impact electric energy producers, oil producers and coal producers. Storing renewable energy has been the missing link.

2475 2018-10-11 19:28:56 And like 3% of the scientific community think climate change is a hoax. Paid for by oil companies. If climate change is a hoax, it’s by far the most well funded, well organized hoax of all hoaxes. Stop watching so much Fox News and read a book. It’s not a conspiracy.
2476 2018-10-11 19:28:55 Not unless Saudi Arabia suddenly runs out of oil in the next month or so.
2477 2018-10-11 19:28:29 Looked like the fire was in the engine bay so oil would not likely leak onto exhaust manifolds. Fuel possibly but most likely electrical issues. Statistics indicate electrical issues dominate in that arena.
2478 2018-10-11 19:28:27 Oil sands, we don't have tar sands . :)

2491 2018-10-11 19:27:21 If you're on a wrong course, change course. If you're in a hole - and you're not digging for oil - stop digging. Never reinforce failure.
2492 2018-10-11 19:27:21 Who said anything about politics?

The executive order gives a one year moratorium

The JV assets could still be sold. There aren't forecasts of an impending oil price crash are there?

Reform is never static. Quite a number of reforms are in process aren't they?

point taken tho

2498 2018-10-11 19:26:30 My favorite part was how it went from "climate change is a hoax" to "it's already too late so we might as well drill oil" in a year.
2499 2018-10-11 19:26:29 That's world oil prices.  Canadian price was avg about $40 in 2008, about $38 now.
2500 2018-10-11 19:26:28 I saw a MASSSSSIVE difference, I had a really red face, too. A lot of oil, a lot of acne. It was nuts.

2. I’ve been “informed” that I “need” the premium oil. Lol. Got the standard. 
3. Heard half the employees mocking the voice of the only fem…

2507 2018-10-11 19:25:54 Never said it was dirty.  Just said you can't be against oil revenue and want to compare social welfare against the Nordic model.  You need the revenue to fund the model. No offense ment to Denmark. My point was you can't have both.
2508 2018-10-11 19:25:48 #CHAR did what they said ‘on the tin’ Drilled their assets That’s about as good as it gets 4 traders/investors on most exploration. ALL had plenty of time/info 2 derisk. The oil wasn’t there. That’s down 2 millions of years of geology. Not the company. Drilling is the acid test!

2522 2018-10-11 19:25:12 You do keep harping on oil. I’m sorry your brother has a hard job, but guess what? Writers were around long before oil was burned and will be around long after the oil industry has gone the way of the dinosaurs it’s pumping.

2534 2018-10-11 19:23:59 in gulf war saddam complained of slant drilling, invaded kuwait, burnt the oil fields who were stealing, then left. 

saddam then started trading oil in Euros, was called oil for food. saddam made about 25% more because he was getting euros not USD

so US took him out
2535 2018-10-11 19:23:58 None of them, that’s the point. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting oil futures one summer and Eduardo won’t come close to getting in. The ability to make money doesn’t impress anybody around here.
2536 2018-10-11 19:23:51 Oil accounts for 7x the GDP compared to your country but we have 72x the population wouldn't make a difference. And we do tax gas on the federal and state level.  Still a drop in the bucket for our population.

2544 2018-10-11 19:22:25 Damn! Btw, I've mixed glowpot marula oil into my hair mix and it's really effective!
2545 2018-10-11 19:22:23 Oil companies stand to lose billion. Scientists stand to lose the earth as we know it. Let's say we are at a crime and we have to figure out whose lying. Who has the best motive?
2546 2018-10-11 19:22:18 And how exactly will voting stop climate change given both Republicans and Democrats are commented to the hip of oil companies and recently voted unanimously in the Senate for a $600bn new budget for the U.S. military which is the biggest polluter in the world.
2547 2018-10-11 19:22:17 We don't need Saudi oil, or Mid East oil for that matter. Thank you Donald Trump! We have fracking, new drilling, and pipelines now. I'm thinking a lot of Saudi money is "leaking" into Democrat campaigns. Another reason to audit the Clinton Foundation!
2548 2018-10-11 19:21:54 Hahaha. I can remember celebrating Norman Whiteside scoring after Kevin Moran was sent off & celebrating like it was a European Cup. I can remember 89/90 very well & see similarities. Also see that the financial power of oil led teams is putting pressure on the traditional teams.
2549 2018-10-11 19:21:41 USD is collapsing. nations leaving USD to pursue deals in other currencies. oil is almost exclusively USD

to prop up USD, create more demand for dollars, block hormuz oil traffic, thus creating shortage, pushing oil up, & therefore USD up, also makes fracking in US profitable

2552 2018-10-11 19:21:29 Social media has really allowed weirdos to feel important enough to think they can argue with someone about their OWN opinion. Bitch be gone and go paint yo son nails while mine learn how to change the oil on your sons car while your sons nails dry 
2553 2018-10-11 19:21:17 Cheers ! I think I have to topup the oil as the lamp time by time blinking. Not all the time . But I don’t wanna risk ! Hope I can handle it
2554 2018-10-11 19:21:17 Our oil gets shipped to refineries in Washington State at a huge discount then gets shipped back across the border at a premium.

2557 2018-10-11 19:21:03 The USA has long had a "sweetheart" agreement with Saudi Arabia. USA pays top $ for their oil, and they spend all of USA's oil money on weapons of war.
2558 2018-10-11 19:20:44 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
2559 2018-10-11 19:20:44 WINNING....Interest rates down lower than expected...banks LOSE;  Saudie problems drop the price of oil....CHEAP GAS PRICES should follow.
2560 2018-10-11 19:20:39 @ranumpowerplay as I said the market is reacting not only to the trump economy but the unknowns of the event horizon including the election and oil prices
2561 2018-10-11 19:20:35 There are 195 countries. There are probably millions of scientists. The oil industry is important to Canada and they are like any other industry. You sound like the conspiracy theorist. Oil companies  in Canada & provide jobs. Dont be fooled by those that want you to be a traitor
2562 2018-10-11 19:20:28 Yes like China and India. Or all those green crusaders flying place to place in their jets lecturing regular people on their oil consumption. I need to get to work to pay for my bills; spare me self righteous hypocrisy.

2564 2018-10-11 19:20:22 Ik had 't over vervuiling in het algemeen. 
Die schepen lopen op zo ongeveer de meest vervuilende vorm van olie, heavy fuel oil...
2565 2018-10-11 19:20:14 Ive never experienced discrimination until I have to do anything involving my car. Like no sir i do not know what kind of engine I have, or the type of oil i need 
2566 2018-10-11 19:20:13 Same could be said of our oil, we will challenge them and our steel will be sold first locally, then in Africa and to the rest of the world. You are suggesting Ajaokuta can never work cos of external influence. I disagree, it has not worked cos all our leaders are selfish
2567 2018-10-11 19:20:07  first let me change my oil kid
2568 2018-10-11 19:19:58 get you some nice essential oils: tea tree, castor oil, avocado, sweet almond etc
2569 2018-10-11 19:19:55 Wash and condition REALLY well cuz you don't want a build-up of oil & product.

Then do a protein treatment (mayonnaise or egg treatment)

Deep condition weekly & exfoliate your scalp.

and NATURAL COCONUT OIL HELPS (make sure it's that real shit tho)

Hope I helped 
2570 2018-10-11 19:19:51 Combine 1 gal water, 1 teaspoon of liquid soap and 1 small bottle of hot sauce. Add a drop or two of cooking oil. Mix & rub it on pumpkins. Cut back on hot sauce if you want, but it helps keep fur-bearin’ critters from noshing. Put some deer corn out for them instead. 
2571 2018-10-11 19:19:41 I love it, virgin oil, garlic n blk pepper!!
2572 2018-10-11 19:19:40 It is fine.. oil took a big hit today which means gas prices will go down  #genius

2579 2018-10-11 19:19:19 ha, if oil is down why r gas prices so damn high, somebody is lieing
2580 2018-10-11 19:19:14 YES IT IS. I have never used anything that has cut the oil on my skin like this. It’s like I have a whole new face.
2581 2018-10-11 19:19:13 Is it a Toyota or Chevy? Has Toyota body with no branding
2582 2018-10-11 19:19:00 Out of Wti oil short from 75 here at 70,90

2584 2018-10-11 19:18:55 @JonExArmy big banks stock are down.... Oil stocks are down news said.  Waiting for another video
2585 2018-10-11 19:18:53 Yeah, but he’s still selling snake oil.  Only now it’s called “tax reform”.
2586 2018-10-11 19:18:35 Their beloved guest dabbed in whale oil (from a lamp) slid into their slit of ecstasy
2587 2018-10-11 19:18:34 Just used the @BurtsBees complexion stick on my nose, brb going into a tea tree oil induced coma.
2588 2018-10-11 19:18:33 Yup. Its literally your whole way of life but green supporters make it sound so easy and dismiss actual concerns. It turns regular people off. I've been saying oil is not sustainable for years but nothing really is being done about the void it will leave.
2589 2018-10-11 19:18:20 The British Labour Party destroyed Iraq, killing & displacing millions of people. They sent Brit troops to Ireland in 1969. Provided the US with military intel in the war on Vietnam. Looted Malaya of its resources. Sent warships to Iran when Mossadegh nationalised oil...
2590 2018-10-11 19:18:04 If the Saudis wake up tomorrow and start accepting other forms of currency other than the US Oil Utility Token, we, with 21 Trillion in debt, are deeply f'd. We will be the latest post on F*ckedCountry.
2591 2018-10-11 19:17:57 Viet nam has not followed the international law by kidnapping #TrinhXuanThanh ,a former oil executives, who claimed political Asylum in Germany. He was smuggled back to Vietnam from EU and now under severe persecution. Please take some action about it!
2592 2018-10-11 19:17:52 You keep jumping specifically to oil riggers, whose jobs ought to soon be nigh obsolete as we transition into solar and wind. I wonder if any of them harbour dreams of becoming a writer?
2593 2018-10-11 19:17:46 Do you still remember using cooking oil muchiita chigumba challenge? 
2594 2018-10-11 19:17:45 Where can I send my CV to ma?

When is the interview ma?

How many gallons of oil should I bring ma?


2595 2018-10-11 19:17:42 Nymex Settles 10/11/18 - CL Nov18: 70.97 (-2.20) (-4.5% vs Last Week) #nymex #wti #oil
2596 2018-10-11 19:17:17 We once had a man coming all the way from Umerkot at Sindh Human  Rights Commission to complain about his neighbour's daughter's underage  marriage. Initiated investigation. Parents scared.
2597 2018-10-11 19:17:16 Just one persons opinion here: Depends on how that affects your warranties honestly. Other than that, as long as you trust the mechanic you bring it to, shouldn't be a problem. Especially just oil changes and services. Bigger fixes might preclude bringing it to the dealer
2598 2018-10-11 19:17:14 Just wait to see what happens to oil futures after the Houston series.
2599 2018-10-11 19:17:13 “Im Sicilian im not white”.......

So you’re mayo with olive oil 
2600 2018-10-11 19:17:12 The fact today is that US oil production is so elastic that once Brent goes above->WTI also increases->US pump oil like there's no tomorrow->Insane inventory build up->crude tumbles.78-82 $ is a fair price with OPEC replacing Iran+Venezuela+Canada.That's the equilibrium imo
2601 2018-10-11 19:17:10 Doesnt have to be that extreme as to have them arrested. You can try some other method. Anonymous messaging or something. Lodge a complaint with NCHR's Peshawar office. They can keep your name under wraps and may call them for inquiry.
2602 2018-10-11 19:17:10 $48 discount on Alberta oil because of dearth of pipelines. Can our illustrious government afford to waste 48million dollars per day.
2603 2018-10-11 19:16:56 I’m confused as to why a lady on the 4 train just put biosilk hair oil all over her face
2604 2018-10-11 19:16:52 Reason 4,682 to be a feminist: When frying calamari for dinner, some oil spat out of the pan and scalds my lip & eyelid. BF takes over the cooking whilst I go cry. He’s taller so it would’ve got his clothes, not his face. And THAT’S why shared domestic roles are important, folks.
2605 2018-10-11 19:16:44 Natural gas & oil pipelines run through the heart of many communities in BC (Chilliwack) Disaster in waiting!
2606 2018-10-11 19:16:41 Nigeria I hail thee, elderly corrupt politicians, rtd generals are ganging up against my @MBuhari because he has denied them oil wells that used to be the norm in the past, u see that the fight is for their selfish interest
2607 2018-10-11 19:16:34 I don’t think people will be rushing to the GP for cannabis oil or gel that you rub on your leg, you can’t smoke it & if you crushed a cannabis tablet & rolled it into a spliff it would do fuck all, they keep the healing properties & remove the bit that gets you high
2608 2018-10-11 19:16:21 . Oil money stops nonsense 
2609 2018-10-11 19:16:17 Or Oil.
2610 2018-10-11 19:16:11 Cutting oil consumption in half would also have a big impact.

We need to fundamentally change our lifestyle in order for the human race to survive.
2611 2018-10-11 19:15:48 Me: I can’t find my new nag champa oil

Husband: I haven’t seen it

Me: I’m getting mad; it was just here.  .....you could say I’m getting...

Husband: Don’t—

Me: ...𝘪𝘯𝘤𝘦𝘯𝘴𝘦𝘥

Husband: *packs things*
2612 2018-10-11 19:15:39 Anyone interested in using or getting initial information on some of the purest CBD Oil in the industry? 
Hit me up via messenger or in this thread.
2613 2018-10-11 19:15:33 There is no GMO sesame, so promoting non-GMO sesame oil is misleading market manipulation that defrauds consumers in violation of @US_FDA rules for truthful, non-misleading food labeling. #shame. #enforcement please @SGottliebFDA, @FTC, @USDA_AMS.
2614 2018-10-11 19:15:33 Completely agree. We earn to get a decent meal and what we get is adulteration from milk to oil, almost every edible product is now adulterated. So sad it is. It is like slow poison. :(
2615 2018-10-11 19:15:32 Furthermore Germany's switch from nuclear to 'green power' (and lots more coal and oil) has made it much more reliant on Russia oil and natural gas
2616 2018-10-11 19:15:28 it’s lit when u go to get your oil changed and they find 100s of dollars worth of other stuff wrong w your car :)
2617 2018-10-11 19:15:27 Apparently the smallest amount of oil can still do enough damage lol
2618 2018-10-11 19:15:08 #1 - show me a nation that hasn't gotten drunk on national oil companies? In the cautionary tale category we have Russia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela...
2619 2018-10-11 19:15:08 Such a nice looking truck.  Again, it'll look really sweet in victory lane.
2620 2018-10-11 19:15:04 The existing economy would die without coal, oil and natural gas and there is nothing that can replace them. But they're horribly finite and we will HAVE to do without them eventually. Physics says so.
2621 2018-10-11 19:15:03 I’m already ready nne. Come and pay my bride price and pluck me from my father’s house. Oil money stops nonsense!
2622 2018-10-11 19:14:39 The change oil light came on when I was driving home so I decided to stop to get my oil changed, since I had time and had been planning to anyway... there’s deeeeeefinitely a breeze
2623 2018-10-11 19:14:34 @realDonaldTrump The price of gasoline is going up and the price of oil is expected to go up to $100/barrel because of your lack of discipline with Iran. Now the Dow is down for six days in a row and has fallen more than 1300 points in 48 hours. Trump--Making America Poor Again!
2624 2018-10-11 19:14:23 Or government doesn't mind Saudi oil much either
2625 2018-10-11 19:14:17 Where education lacks birds can't fly serene cloaked in oil go figure
2626 2018-10-11 19:14:13 In need of a back massage wit lots of oil and lots of love 
2627 2018-10-11 19:14:05 Depletion will lead to us getting off coal, oil and natural gas relatively soon and there isn't a thing that "renewable" technologies can do about it. Solar and wind can't hold a candle to the power of fossilized sunlight.
2628 2018-10-11 19:13:56 Exactly. This incident is just the latest in a long line of absurdly immoral behavior on the part of the Saud dynasty. And every nation just puts up with it cuz they have oil money.
2629 2018-10-11 19:13:52 Getting my baby so new oil in her engine 
2630 2018-10-11 19:13:51 There are 1,120 calories in a box of cracked pepper and olive oil Wheat Thins. @RichGillette and I ate the whole box. Each of us ate more than a quarter of the recommended calories for the day in crackers simply because they were there.

2632 2018-10-11 19:13:01 Never said it was dirty.  My comments were to Americans.  They seem to want to have no oil and free healthcare.  Hard to have both.
2633 2018-10-11 19:12:56 bua creía que le habías Oil de Aceite
2634 2018-10-11 19:12:38 How can you say that as an engineer. fossil fuel is NOT energy as you know. germyn has $1 trillion in green energy tech orders on the books. oodles of 40-70€/hr jobs! why pander to big oil boys with soft PR? Dangerous
2635 2018-10-11 19:12:36 Ko cooking oil hauna
2636 2018-10-11 19:12:27 Lol uhm I just style it, if not treat it u know moes hair food, sprays...hair food with amla oil works
2637 2018-10-11 19:12:23 At this age, work is something I do between Googling "Can you eat too much olive oil?" and watching reruns of @JudgeJudy
2638 2018-10-11 19:12:16 Bring oil with you
2639 2018-10-11 19:12:09 it’s not Trump that’s tryna destroy your homeland it’s bigger than the government. lol illuminati tryna control the oil , money & power. trumps just a puppet honestly
2640 2018-10-11 19:12:05 OGX brand has done wonders for my hair. I would look at the products for your concerns for the best kind for your hair. I use the keratin shampoo &conditioner &after I shower, I use their extra strength coconut oil in my hair. Has helped my spilt ends& my hair has grown a lot too
2641 2018-10-11 19:11:56 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2642 2018-10-11 19:11:44 this is a mess. I can't believe I have to fly to London and sprinkle luck oil and rub my lapis crystal on all of them.
2643 2018-10-11 19:11:30 Trump Tariffs and Tradewars raise prices, reduce profits. #GOPTaxScam piles on debt. Interest rates have been rising as have oil prices. 

Everything act as A TAX on consumers. Wages have not kept pace. 

GOP is grossly incompetent.
2644 2018-10-11 19:11:24 This list would just be cheeses, so I’ll do a non-dairy one:

Garlic oil
Arugula
Wild mushrooms
Prosciutto (or pepperoni)
Basil
2645 2018-10-11 19:11:07 The Cafe Mac Pizza for dinner today will be: spicy crust with greasy motor oil and meat lovers.
2646 2018-10-11 19:11:00 My lips were dry af and i didn’t have anything else  it was olive oil 
2647 2018-10-11 19:10:57 yes, I dont want scheer representing my country. Just like harper visited trump right before nafta talks. Stay out of the way. Where is his funding from ....if you follow, bets its koch, oil and murdoch.
2648 2018-10-11 19:10:53 Until Markets stabilize, 

Do not invest in the Gambling stocks, and cash commodities like #OIL & #gold

They will be the 1st to be sold when margin calls hit the gamblers in Wall Street

$AAPL $FB $TSLA etc
2649 2018-10-11 19:10:53 The true shills are the ones not pointing fingers at oil companies. They don’t have feelings to hurt with pointed fingers. And, as an added bonus, if enough fingers are pointed, a sane POTUS might sign an executive order putting them out of business.
2650 2018-10-11 19:10:51 Changing your own oil makes you feel accomplished lol
2651 2018-10-11 19:10:44 Did oil drop again 
2652 2018-10-11 19:10:21 あの時のBBの言葉はスッゲー嬉しかったなー…
2653 2018-10-11 19:10:18 real life translation: @realDonaldTrump does not have the spine to stand up to #SaudiArabia.  He likes their money & oil way too much.
2654 2018-10-11 19:10:18 I remember @jahprayzah achiviga  PureDrop cooking oil.
2655 2018-10-11 19:10:10 This is nothing new. Americans have been licking Saudi ass since they discovered oil.
2656 2018-10-11 19:10:05 えるしっているか、遠藤氏は油しか飲まない。
2657 2018-10-11 19:09:54 On top
2658 2018-10-11 19:09:40 I use CBD oil and Minecraft. One battle at a time. We can beat it back.
2659 2018-10-11 19:09:34 We’re sorry to hear about your experience. Car Scented Oil is now sold by Niteo Products, which uses the Glade brand name under license from SC Johnson. We want to be sure you get in touch with them directly. You can contact them at 800-678-1910 or acinquiries@niteoproducts.com.
2660 2018-10-11 19:09:24 I understand that and that’s why the report included 91 scientists from 40 different countries. Less bias. More diverse research funding. The only scientists against climate  change can all be linked to Big oil.
2661 2018-10-11 19:09:14 Greg, why isn't oil up?
2662 2018-10-11 19:09:14 Need to get on the oil field 
2663 2018-10-11 19:09:12 Because offering Alberta oil worked so well . That , apparently , wasn't "helpful" either.
2664 2018-10-11 19:09:02 I just hope that the cooking oil #Chigumba is using for her face it's not the same that is sold in Zim she might struggle to find it
2665 2018-10-11 19:08:29 Same with coconut oil. That shit turns liquid at 74 degrees. No worries.
2666 2018-10-11 19:08:26 Nothing can be done. The girls won't say anything infront of their parents. They'll hate me instead if I got them arrested.
2667 2018-10-11 19:08:18 Putter ji ye pepsi coke ya cooking oil ki agency nahi 
Be care full warna baji gulbakhari say rabta karlay

Limit hoti hia har bat ki
2668 2018-10-11 19:08:07 So only some people have to change? Why cant I drive the gas/diesel? Who determines who uses what? How will you incentivize changing to greener options when other people still use oil products? Why would people choose more expensive less reliable transportation?
2669 2018-10-11 19:08:07 Your best bet is to get cannabis oil. I don't mean smoking pot you ingest the oil. Go to "Phoenix Tears- R ick Simpson" This medication is natural, no side effect, it's been working for the past 15 yrs and you can make it yourself. pierrelaberge066@gmail.com
2670 2018-10-11 19:07:59 To the man standing up waiting for his cars oil change to finish, sit down ive been here 3hrs. fool
2671 2018-10-11 19:07:46 I’m pan fryining chicken strips open w/ olive oil for my salad. 

Y’all are not gonna believe what happened today...ughhhh. I’ll tell ya in a little. Better watch this chicken...Don’t wanna ruin the top part of the stove. 
2672 2018-10-11 19:07:39 It’s just clear that even though Jackson Maine looked greasy and unwashed through that whole movie he 100% always smelled like an incredible mixture of Moroccan oil and the wood floors of the first Baptist Church west of the Mississippi
2673 2018-10-11 19:07:39 That would take oil prices up
2674 2018-10-11 19:07:32 When you believe a man without First School leaving Certificate and who is also not the OPEC chairmanthat he will make a $= N1 and petrol sell for less than the international cost of crude oil then you can believe anything. Mental slavery, Foolish Majority
2675 2018-10-11 19:07:21 Where are the Neon Numbers though ?
2676 2018-10-11 19:07:17 Nope, I think there would be rally considering oil touching 80 already
2677 2018-10-11 19:07:16 Now that cannabis oil is more available for wonderful little kids in the UK (no mention of THC’s role in stopping seizures), maybe they’ll move on to powering vehicles with it and heating homes with it, not to mention clothing people with cannabis, building homes and so on.
2678 2018-10-11 19:07:00 Yes, I haven’t disputed that. My objection is to the implication that  this somehow is something that can’t be copied. And also to the idea that the tax revenue from oil is somehow dirty, when the opposite is the case. What would be dirty is subsidies.
2679 2018-10-11 19:06:58 Exactly!!! You rarely hear Tories mention it but I did hear one say it on a Thatcher memories programme..only watched one of them and was left astonished to hear a Tory say that the oil and gas tax got Thatchers Gov out of all sorts of problems without it they would've been fin
2680 2018-10-11 19:06:42 Using it as a shaving oil works amazing as well
2681 2018-10-11 19:06:41 Minum dan sapu pure olive oil
2682 2018-10-11 19:06:32 yes & cologne/fragrance oil should make you smell better
2683 2018-10-11 19:06:22 근디 거의 겨울인듯
2684 2018-10-11 19:06:22 when you see that “fresh oil and chips” sign that’s when you know you’re back in pennsylvania
2685 2018-10-11 19:06:20 wildin out with a twix in the oil painting room
2686 2018-10-11 19:06:18 When is the last time you had a SUPER JOINT? 1.5g's of Pineapple Stout Flower, Blue Dream Oil & Mr. Nice Kief! So tasty! PuffPuffPass.
2687 2018-10-11 19:06:01 Well,you are now up shit’s creek without a paddle.....j/k. The cesspool is  a more accurate way of saying ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Life, death, and rebirth. For the purposes of whitewashing, urine, feces, and blood are what lay underneath the holy oil and the blessings.
2688 2018-10-11 19:05:33 Yeah, and the problem with not mowing is it gives the d@mn mosquitoes even more places to breed and hide. We did do a garlic oil spray on the last dry day, helps a little, but mowing would do a lot more.
2689 2018-10-11 19:05:17 Wonderful oil on canvas artworks by James Griffin :)
2690 2018-10-11 19:05:16 Avocado oil is doing wonders for my face..
2691 2018-10-11 19:05:14 I put engine and transmission oil in my car this morning and now it’s all I’m smelling
2692 2018-10-11 19:05:11 I think you're being rather too optimistic. Yes, with rising oil prices and cutting of revenue leakages, debts should be reduced. I really hope they reduce on the borrowing and look to boost revenue from within.
2693 2018-10-11 19:05:01 Come try our new lushes body oil Sol by Epicuren. Get 10% for a limited time only. Expires 10/15/18.

2695 2018-10-11 19:04:59 Oil but they have oil.
2696 2018-10-11 19:04:48 #EIA expects West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices will average about $68/b in 2018 and $70/b in 2019. EIA forecast responses to significant uncertainty about the effects of sanctions on Iran and the response members of the OPEC and other countries might have.
2697 2018-10-11 19:04:46 Moroccan oil and hair moisturizing masks help!
2698 2018-10-11 19:04:45 I used my pick me up foam wash today+pumpkin Enzyme Mask+ oil blend that I make special for my skin. 
I can make you something specific for your skin type too, all you have to do is ask. 
2699 2018-10-11 19:04:44 I started using this 10 days ago and after 15 years of insomnia I am finally getting some sleep after using CBD Oil. @BethannyFrankel give it a try. It relaxes you enough so you can sleep

2751 2018-10-11 19:00:45 It's all about the money. Big oil gives politicians the corporate mindset. Make sure you show a big profit this quarter, don't think about next quarter until it gets here. Long range planning isn't a thing anymore. There's plenty of money in renewables, but they don't see that.

All this should equate to market moving up from way oversold, yet it is plummeting. 
One would think CPI was 0.3, and rates were now 3.30%

E.G. Cdn oil and gas invests more in environment than all other industry combined and are global clean tech leaders.

2827 2018-10-11 18:53:55 U.S. military is the largest user of oil.
2828 2018-10-11 18:53:50 Do u think 100 yrs from now women will b able to get an oil change without being patronized by macho men? Maybe our cars won't even need oil changes? ....nvm
2829 2018-10-11 18:53:49 i think it honestly depends on how much you take, how long you've been taking it, and the amount of thc (usually small, but it is unregulated) contained in the oil. if you're super concerned, definitely stop taking it until after the drug test.
2830 2018-10-11 18:53:48 "...Is this all simply an effort to pressure the KSA to increase oil output in order decrease prices?  The media spotlight on this isolated case (while they turn a blind eye to infinitely more horrific behavior) is suspicious indeed."

2831 2018-10-11 18:53:46 The irony of the convention of putting Shetland in a box on maps is that should England manage to partition Shetland, that box represents the precisely zero Oil fields that new, "British" enclave would have the right to licence out.
2832 2018-10-11 18:53:42 do i have mutuals who wanna grab coffee and discuss serum/acid/oil hoarding strategies before deciem collapses?
2833 2018-10-11 18:53:38 Olive oil that was on the salad bar .
2834 2018-10-11 18:53:36 How are we supposed to believe he walked out the back door and no one has heard from him since? This is sick. Trump needs to make Saudi pay for their actions maybe stop buying oil. Reckless young prince doesn’t own the world
2835 2018-10-11 18:53:28 #OilPrices Plunge! Currently Brent Crude trades down 3% at $79.78. Earlier oil prices hit a four-year high, with the international benchmark Brent oil topping more than $86 per barrel, but on last Friday it went down to $84 a barrel. Brent Crude trades down 3% at $79.78
2836 2018-10-11 18:53:12 He surely liberated trillions worth in oil and resources! And the millions of souls liberated by facilitating their deaths! @JoeBiden #GeorgeW
2837 2018-10-11 18:53:09 Maybe next week I’ll remember to schedule an oil change
2838 2018-10-11 18:53:06 “Sir here are your filters we can try to clean them or get you new ones for about $30 each”

Me: “Clean em imma get some later” (pulls up to O’Reilly... $10 a piece)

Moral of the story: I just came for the oil change... thanks for the heads up tho!
2839 2018-10-11 18:52:54 just got my oil changed. lady at da front asked me what kind of oil my car needs i had no clue i just went to grab dat canola vegetable oil and asked if they could get it poppin wit dat

2841 2018-10-11 18:52:49 No I am saying that the Nordic model depends on revenue from oil which it clearly does.

2844 2018-10-11 18:52:43 Oil paint pen is what I’ve heard works well. There isn’t really anything to “remove” it per-se. But painting over it should help. @_just_Ed or @the_boostdemon I think have used them before and may have recommendations on a particular brand. I may be remembering incorrectly though
2845 2018-10-11 18:52:41 The last fall for October probably... Man why do traders forget news, nov 4 is big..

2849 2018-10-11 18:52:16 Trump has convinced them that he is rich because he's figured out the system that keeps people like them down and he makes empty promises that he will uncover this huge conspiracy, clear the path, speak hard truths and they will all prosper in the end. He's selling snake oil.
2850 2018-10-11 18:52:14 I’m not convinced your “hard work” is constructive. Certainly, the “hard work” of oil executives is destructive.
2851 2018-10-11 18:52:11 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

2860 2018-10-11 18:51:06 Hey Joe, you seem to be very concerned about Trump paying more money in interest expenses; how about starting a GoFundMe campaign for Trump to help him pay the interest on those illegal loans? Nice call on oil too.

2862 2018-10-11 18:51:01 I forgot how strong this hair oil is.
I just colored it and decided that it is way too dry.
So, I found some hair oil in the closet and I am not kidding,
I smell like a salad.
And, I have to go buy ballet wear at a specialty shop and smell like salad.
We have such problems.
2863 2018-10-11 18:51:00 While owner’s manuals for today’s cars recommend long intervals between oil changes, frequent changes flush abrasive dirt and metal particles out of the engine, prolonging its life.

2865 2018-10-11 18:50:53 Actually it's because of sulphur content (<0.5%) that the two oils are differentiated with Light sweet being less dense than Brentand bcoz Brent is used as a yardstick of oil pricing

2868 2018-10-11 18:50:09 Gas would be a lot less if Obama didn’t block the Keystone XL pipeline. Canada has an excess of oil we are trying to get to market.
2869 2018-10-11 18:49:40 That's the relationship... and oil.
2870 2018-10-11 18:49:33 Think you are not getting the point. During midst of terrorism in Sri Lanka. US and the West wanted us to stop fighting the terrorists saying its HR Violations ??? then at the same time ignore what happens in Oil Rich countries ????

2872 2018-10-11 18:49:17 You had to know a correction in the stock market was coming.  Rising interest rates, rising prices in oil, concerns about trade tariffs and uncertainly in the mid-term elections all are contributing factors. But the fact is stocks are over valued and a correction was overdue.

2880 2018-10-11 18:48:34 And if you did start taxing oil as much as we do, you’d have even more money to spend on welfare than we do.
2881 2018-10-11 18:48:34 Trump is OK, actually eager, to increase “ARMS SALES” to the murderous dictator of Saudi Arabia. 

Now is the time to rejoin the Paris Accord and decrease dependence on oil to take this regime down.

2884 2018-10-11 18:48:04 WAKE UP! What DOES IT TAKE? How many storms, deaths, drought, floods, does it take before you demand Trump stop CO2 emissions instead of regulation roll backs for OIL COMPANIES?  VOTE representatives who want humanity to survive!!! Do your homework!
2885 2018-10-11 18:47:58 The oil dependency means this is nothing more than empty political rhetoric
2886 2018-10-11 18:47:55 This nigga Vic Mensa said put a dab of peppermint oil in the filter of American Nats and it’s a Whole Foods Newport 
2887 2018-10-11 18:47:54 @MichaelTondre argues that Victorians conflated oil with coal which helped motivate the transition to petroleum from coal which is dramatized by Conrad’s ‘Victory’ #navsa2018
2888 2018-10-11 18:47:54 Do we know if he is alive? Best attack on Saudi is push down the price of oil, and we are just the ones who can.
2889 2018-10-11 18:47:48 Surely #brent #oil bounces from here...
2890 2018-10-11 18:47:46 But for oil, the US would not have, nor ever had, any interest in the Saudi’s. None. Zilch.  Economic necessity is a bitch.

2896 2018-10-11 18:46:58 Re. point 1, it’s entirely a political choice to tax oil companies or not. It’s no secret that DK funds welfare through high taxes, but it’s not like we have a patent preventing others from implementing the same idea.

2904 2018-10-11 18:45:59 I know. Once I found out how obvious it is that Trump basically controls 23.2 trillion US$ I couldn’t wrap my mind around the fact that no one else has come to that conclusion. He won’t be stopped anytime soon. KSA delivers oil and that’s black gold. VKM is Republican.

2930 2018-10-11 18:43:07 funny how oil thinks no one will fill their tanks with gas because stocks are down lol. but.. with equities down that precipitously algos read recession
2931 2018-10-11 18:43:01 I experimented with carnivory, but a primal/paleo approach works best for me. Almond butter is a staple. #NSNG most days, skipping breakfast due to lack of hunger. Almost no butter or coconut oil, see no need for it -> automatically low sat fat.

2936 2018-10-11 18:42:34 Your points seems to be:

1) DK can only afford welfare because of oil revenues, and

2) DK exploits the planet in doing so. 

Admittedly, I’ve mostly spoken to point 2, and my point is that DK is no worse than the US, in fact it’s somewhat better.
2937 2018-10-11 18:42:34 Using BODMAS= the issue is that him and buhari has never had a good relationship, & again PMB refused to renew his oil block licence & some others including that of OBJ..

2951 2018-10-11 18:41:18 I don't suggest foaming cleansers for oily skin at all. I suggest oil cleansing. Jojoba oil or grapeseed are great to oil cleanse with.
2952 2018-10-11 18:41:12 Ya, oil companies never fear monger about higher prices or people losing jobs.
2953 2018-10-11 18:41:07 Ngono Natangwe naye could have used the knowledge. Pamwe ombwiti ya mbwitikika. I bet he also keeps sunflower oil in the fridge 
2954 2018-10-11 18:41:05 Almost $100 for a damn oil change gah damn
2955 2018-10-11 18:40:31 The beard oil from Body Shop does wonders. 
2956 2018-10-11 18:40:30 Hahah I've resorted to magnesium oil bc it smells better 
2957 2018-10-11 18:40:26 Y’all in 2018 while i’m in new york does anyone have any oil?
2958 2018-10-11 18:40:24 ＢＢひでえよ…(泣

2960 2018-10-11 18:40:22 independent research states that once DonaldTrump abolishes a crucial regulation, a true #Christian writes a song about #love
2961 2018-10-11 18:40:14 Thinking at 500 followers a random person will win an oil show video... 
2962 2018-10-11 18:40:10 My upstairs neighbour complained to my landlord because I smoke in my apartment. So, I sealed off my doorway, plugged in 5 scented oil thingies(one in hallway) and lit 6 dragons blood incense sticks...
2963 2018-10-11 18:40:08 Bah, just put up your feet, have a beer and oil that chainsaw bar.
2964 2018-10-11 18:40:08 Uwuye ne 2L cooking oil....
2965 2018-10-11 18:40:07 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
2966 2018-10-11 18:40:02 We do not directly tax the oil at the well @ 53% so this is irrelevant.
2967 2018-10-11 18:39:44 이러다가 나두 남캐편파 하겟음,,,;;;^^ 근데 그러면 안 대자나? 난 지성인이니까 쒸빠
2968 2018-10-11 18:39:44 Hydrating, chemical exfoliation, and evening primrose oil for inflammation can help. Paula's Choice has a great Hyaluronic Acid serum. And help unclog your pores with something like the Pixi Glow Tonic. Hormonal acne is hard to treat because its internal.
2969 2018-10-11 18:39:07 my favorite non animal fat oil tbh bill also do not be afraid to use that oil u can always blot it or drain it afterwards but without it your hashbrowns will get that not tasty browned/burned texture the oil is your lubricating fren not a health enemy
2970 2018-10-11 18:39:04 For soft silky hair, Use olive oil on your hair 1-2 hours once every week. After 1-2 hours wash out the excess oil that didn't penetrate.
2971 2018-10-11 18:39:03 But the crazy thing is, they are "winning" by pushing bad policy and calling it good business. Why would you focus on a finite resource (coal or oil)? What benefit does low gas mileage do for the car owner? And, preventative care is cheaper than a hospital crisis.
2972 2018-10-11 18:39:02 We have to get Californians to shut down all air conditioning before we even consider shutting down our oil.
2973 2018-10-11 18:38:51 @CunninghamsCrew The global powers are intentionally trying to raise oil prices and int rates to crush the Donald.
2974 2018-10-11 18:38:39 Ohhh.. That's impossible kenan, but the thing is just too much.
2975 2018-10-11 18:38:33 Anyone tried cbd oil? 

I keep getting it recommended to me by ppl for anxiety

 but everywhere that carries it is pretty woo so wondering about other ppls experiences?
2976 2018-10-11 18:38:29 Oil is sold in dollars so every time a barrel is pumped out of the ground that is backing up more of those dollars.

2979 2018-10-11 18:38:17 we had some art teachers in their ~50s but the oldest guy was probably nearer to ~70. He was kind of a pain in the ass because of how strict and particular he was, but underneath all his pickiness was a dude who really loves oil painting.
2980 2018-10-11 18:38:15 Nifty uppar bhage gaaa ! Currency & Oil benefits ????
2981 2018-10-11 18:37:59 Absolutely heartbroken for a patient today. Our healthcare system is a god damn joke and each and every day I work in Hospice I am reminded of this fact. Corporations’ bottom lines and human services are oil and water.
2982 2018-10-11 18:37:57 Saudi negotiating with China to sell oil in Yuan?
2983 2018-10-11 18:37:50 @FatKidDeals is the essential oil diffuser sale still going :)?
2984 2018-10-11 18:37:40 You'll honestly have to mute all of us
2985 2018-10-11 18:37:38 When you bring your car in for an oil change and they find more wrong with it <
2986 2018-10-11 18:37:35 China tariffs plus oil = inflation. No more Goldilocks for asset prices.
2987 2018-10-11 18:37:29 A4: #data is more than new oil.  #data is currency of your future ability to operate.  Each industry is seeing pace evolve to rapidly identify #context, correlate opportunity, and execute.  Treat #data accordingly.  Find context.  #ML opportunity.  Dont lose #empathy #CIOChat
2988 2018-10-11 18:37:29 You are all so lucky my hair is super fine. At the 24 hour mark it looks so greasy you would think I had chunky dunked in coconut oil. Gotta clean mine every day
2989 2018-10-11 18:37:20 If you wanted to do something for the environment you would cancel all well leases and sell your positions in the oil companies.  You would cap the wells and go solar. But you need the money to pay for general welfare. So it won't happen.
2990 2018-10-11 18:37:19 The red oil there are some particles under the oils erh that be where all the juice dey.
2991 2018-10-11 18:36:54 I am pondering: rocket, chard, beetroot stems, grated carrot, capers, anchovies, pickled walnuts, Cornish Yarg, garlicky olive oil, sourdough
2992 2018-10-11 18:36:52 Good and very timely interview Donald, would have been nice to ask for clarification on future funding, wether that be through oil sales, Rbl or other means.

2996 2018-10-11 18:36:25 the craziest thing I’ve ever heard was when a girl I used to work with told me that she would cover her whole head in olive oil and hang upside down bc she thought her hair might grow faster. crazy ass bitch lmao. she was awesome tho. I miss her.
2997 2018-10-11 18:36:24 Why is my prof spitting oil paints in my face
2998 2018-10-11 18:36:20 That's double standard by the West. One law for Oil Rich countries and one law for countries they can inflict pain. West's foreign policies are still shite to be honest.
2999 2018-10-11 18:36:07 Whose was the first tongue to determine that light crude oil was sweet?
3000 2018-10-11 18:36:06 WTI Oil almost below $70. Crazy days.
3001 2018-10-11 18:36:01 Omg that’s so awful in thankful it’s just a battery and new wipers. But i just had to get tires and i need an oil change  i hate being an adult.
3002 2018-10-11 18:35:58 Yep, this is what happened to me. Honestly I was just not getting good variety of fats. A lot of red meat, mct oil, and butter. Still eat all of those but have replaced bulletproof coffee with black coffee 75% of the time, and instead of steak every day, I’m eating more salmon.
3003 2018-10-11 18:35:57 The castor oil contains a natural laxative, which messes with your stomach and starts to create the contractions, it won’t necessarily make you go to the bathroom unless you take too much castor oil!!!!
3004 2018-10-11 18:35:50 I be so embarrassed taking my car in for an oil change lol they be like bitch ???? How is your car even working ???? It’s been 3 years since your last oil change
3005 2018-10-11 18:35:35 Be more judicious on what lands and where the LEASES are granted...cattle, oil interests and mining...Zinke has close ties with the oil industry...
3006 2018-10-11 18:35:33 Hi , he is a Nigerian male scammer he has went across the globe finding victims he sends romance and texts and calls says he on a oil rig and needs help he scammed a 72 years old sweet widow and many others we are trying to stop the evil scammer by warnings
3007 2018-10-11 18:35:28 I haven’t found a fall candle that I like this year. So I’ve made my own diffuser oil blend and it’s giving me life.
3008 2018-10-11 18:35:26 What are the sources of water for the generator? Primary source- seal oil and seals, hydrogen coolers, stator cooling water (clip leaks), thermal cycling of generator #webinar #H2 #utility
3009 2018-10-11 18:35:25 It’s useless battle with all the trumpets in office. Big banks, big oil  and all those who don’t believe in science.
3010 2018-10-11 18:35:13 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

3012 2018-10-11 18:35:05 No lie, if I ever became president, I'd completely cut the US off of the SA teet of oil.
3013 2018-10-11 18:35:05 #CIOChat Q4. Sunil, also, suggests that #data + #customers are critical assets to orgs? If these are new oil, what steps should CIOs take to refine #customerdata?
3014 2018-10-11 18:35:00 I do ignore all of it. But it was interesting to peak,

3020 2018-10-11 18:34:36 Nope sir, OPEC indicating falling price fr next year due to global slowdown nd India will not be insulated. U r aware of  2008 bear market nd its implications globally hw unraveled. Oil definitely will go down as yield, bond prices increasing globally nd high debt too. 
3021 2018-10-11 18:34:24 He’s an end of the year dump, I think, if the Oil don’t show up.
3022 2018-10-11 18:34:20 I'm not on facebook but peaked on someones...was quite surprised.
Least twitter is like Cilit Bang...Block and the dirt is gone.
3023 2018-10-11 18:34:14 Tell me how I was puffing my oil pen and it RAN OUT.... the audacity
3024 2018-10-11 18:34:07 Wow. Really? You called yourself "Venezuelan lawyer specialized in International Law and Foreign Affairs"? Please. There are a LOT of people here that have BRAINS. Despite the non stop lies about Venezuela, everyone KNOWS that the US´s wants Venezuela´s WORLD BIGGEST OIL RESERVE.

3026 2018-10-11 18:33:50 Take a spoon full of castor oil! This is what started my contractions!3hrs later ! Chase the oil down with some juice !!!!!
3027 2018-10-11 18:33:49 Its good for hair so it shouldnt be too bad for my scalp

3028 2018-10-11 18:33:44 Oil is taking a nice breather. $70.97...down from 75 just yesterday
3029 2018-10-11 18:33:39 We are already living on debt. All them oil underground have been bought by China. It belongs to them. You have no idea how down the bottom this country of ours is.

3031 2018-10-11 18:33:23 Dead skin cells of the body can be removed by applying mixture of olive oil and salt. Replacing salt with granulated sugar can work too.
3032 2018-10-11 18:33:18 Did a little test on a section of mama hair with the butter and oooooh my, the softness and curl pop! Mommy twin!Hope it stays moisturized cause the coconut oil on pause, as it's starting to dry out my baby hair.
3033 2018-10-11 18:33:16 hi there, i'm Stan "Stanley" Loona. that's the name my parents gave me. i'm the new CEO of Exxon-Mobil, and i'm here to talk to u about the impending Oil Wars
3034 2018-10-11 18:33:12 Yeah that's cause the U.N is still stuck in the idea that the market can solve this. Taxes wont fix it. Nationalizing all oil and natural gas companies and transitioning them to clean energy as rapidly as possible is the only way to save the planet
3035 2018-10-11 18:33:06 selling oil currencies working
3036 2018-10-11 18:33:05 "he had not sought a hike in the tax, but instead wanted to secure cross-party support to establish a "long-term floor price" in relation to a barrel of oil ... a minimum of €200 to the end user How wd that have worked? What role can TD's have in setting price of barrel of oil?
3037 2018-10-11 18:33:03 Also the taxes have nothing to do with the enviornent.  It's for revenue and you export the oil for use.
3038 2018-10-11 18:33:00 sana oil!!!!
3039 2018-10-11 18:32:55 Jadi cleansing oil gitu?
3040 2018-10-11 18:32:54 #EIA increased the forecast spot price for #Brent #crude #oil to $74 per barrel (b) in 2018 and to $75/b in 2019, up by $2/b and $1/b, respectively, from last month's forecast. EIA expects #WTI prices will average about $68/b in 2018 & $70/b in 2019.
3041 2018-10-11 18:32:53 How @asorock hopes to pay the new proposed minimum wage of N24k beats me,not to mention the N30k NLC is demanding..Our 2017 wage bill was N1.87trn on oil revenues of N1.12trn..Settling at N27k = a N2.8trn wage bill..Already many states can't even pay N18k,I see more owed salaries
3042 2018-10-11 18:32:53 Exactly.. I suspect the pharma companies held off cannabis oil because the cost is cheaper and they lose profit..
3043 2018-10-11 18:32:48 White Angelica oil from Young Living
3044 2018-10-11 18:32:46 I know it needs to be done. Oil is a finite resource. But people have valid questions. A whole way of living has to be changed and you dont have all the answers. Winter sun is not as powerful as summer. What about cloud cover? Low income people..can they afford enough panels?
3045 2018-10-11 18:32:35 If you factor the carbon generation from oil, from well to pump, it gets super interesting too
3046 2018-10-11 18:32:33 RT IbeKachikwu: 4. I have worked at the highest level of the Oil and Gas industry globally for over 3 decades and indeed lectured at respectable global institutions like University of Ife, Nigerian Law School and Harvard Law School.
3047 2018-10-11 18:32:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.

3055 2018-10-11 18:31:33 Who can afford to eat? I have celiac disease & sometimes I honestly wonder if I can afford to eat anymore. I find myself choosing between water & food, gas & food, oil & food. What r we going 2 do?
3056 2018-10-11 18:31:30 Granted I do feel that big oil should pax California's gas tax, voting yes on prop 6 or voting Republican won't make things in California any better #VoteGreen #NoOnProp6
3057 2018-10-11 18:31:04 I suppose it would be too difficult to connect a propeller to the turbo axle and make a turbo-fan (it should have much more thrust for the same power). (BTW, the oil circuit should probably have a pressure regulator)
3058 2018-10-11 18:31:04 People with cars bitch about the price of oil changes and gas then you got my dumbass who has a diesel that cost 110$ to fill up and 160$ to change the oil#fuckit
3059 2018-10-11 18:30:44 I have a appointment for an oil change but this rain is blowing mine 
3060 2018-10-11 18:30:35 Reminds me of the Bushes not wanting to hold them accountable for 9/11. Oil money (and arms money) is so corrupting. The GOPers are also selling out the planet for the oil money. GOP agenda: Death, death, death, and more death.

3065 2018-10-11 18:30:23 i'm 6 mins in and i have a few thoughts. 
1. Awesome, Bri is on this episode
2. IT'S ON SIGHT
3. David's impression of Sean's impression of him, sounds like there's an oil tycoon Muppet based on an evil elephant character from Babar.
3066 2018-10-11 18:30:23 @realDonaldTrump The Jews are pushing for Iran's oil to be exported, see how much money they receive from the Iranian regime, who do not want this regime to collapse. I always say something with my thoughts, and I make a mistake, Saudi Arabia has not done anything,
3067 2018-10-11 18:30:20 Political machinery requires the right type of oil. Viscosity of these stories are so complex and thick with legalese they could cause the messaging engine to seize up during an election cycle. Post election cycle the engine will be replaced with an all purpose Justice engine.
3068 2018-10-11 18:30:13 LMFAOOOOOO I be like oh I know this guy he doesn’t even need any oil just drain it ! LOLOL

3070 2018-10-11 18:30:10 I hadn't realised he was involved but consulting a stage hypnotist & self-help snake oil salesman who makes millions selling something of no tangible benefit to the  gullible is just so #Brexit.
3071 2018-10-11 18:30:01 @foundmyfitness Hi Rhonda. Could you tell me what fish oil were you referring to on the JR pod? Thank you 
3072 2018-10-11 18:30:00 When I finish as the host of 'Jeopardy!' I'm going to go up to Taft in central California. They have a small college there that teaches you about oil drilling. Alex Trebek
3073 2018-10-11 18:29:53 Aaah. Okay o.
Both parties didn’t mention the producer sha.
But does this mean oil well for the producer?

3074 2018-10-11 18:29:52 "We're an energy superpower, and we're also too small to matter." How can we claim that our actions don't matter when Canada has the world's third-largest oil reserves?

3078 2018-10-11 18:29:41 "Coastal lawsuits have had a chilling effect on the oil and gas industry." - @sharonhewitt
3079 2018-10-11 18:29:33 Maybe, just maybe, stop sending billions of dollars overseas and invest it into developing something useful. Oil and gas is here to stay until something else is found and WORKS and is cost efficient. On second thought, to hell with it, heres your tax Canada.
3080 2018-10-11 18:29:22 Be cautious of the benefits being attributed to CBD oil.  Also with respect to anxiety and medication, changing any form of regiment is always difficult and there's no guarantee that what had worked prior to a change will work again if reverted back to.  In most cases, it won't.

3085 2018-10-11 18:28:56 I’m also sick of hearing activists protest oil production then jump in their car n drive home, n be surrounded by all their petroleum based products. Clean innovative solutions will take a long while to replace all petro based products. Be a few more generations
3086 2018-10-11 18:28:52 You never realize how much oil your face and eyelashes can make until you own a pair of glasses
3087 2018-10-11 18:28:46 But we like their oil and money so whatcha gonna do ?
3088 2018-10-11 18:28:41 ive come to the conclusion that regular flower weed & oil cartidges have separate tolerances. ive been using my pen daily for the past month, smoked flower yesterday got ST00PID high & had an anxiety attack lol
3089 2018-10-11 18:28:38 No wonder my oil light comes on every month and half 
3090 2018-10-11 18:28:36 I agree Ricky, but she was talking about price. Unfortunately because of the low smoke point you can't really cook on a high flame with olive oil. I tend to actually cook with coconut oil for the health benefits as I'm primarily paleo.
3091 2018-10-11 18:28:32 Murad essential c toner

3092 2018-10-11 18:28:14 @afowler06 mate can you help me out with CBD, do you recommend the vape or oil for a first purchase? I want to try it, I’m just trying to find out if it is on informed sports due to work. Cheers pal and keep up the hard work and your rise to the top 
3093 2018-10-11 18:27:50 Can you name one oil block that has been allocated since Jonathan left? Just one!
3094 2018-10-11 18:27:34 Hopefully the leak is on the low pressure side of the injector? Shouldn't be too hard to fix as long as the diesel is not entering the inside of the engine and mixing with the engine oil? Check dipstick (that's not an insult!) :-)
3095 2018-10-11 18:27:33 The best part of coming out has been, hands down, openly blotting the oil off my pizza in front of toxically male cashiers #NationalComingOutDay2018 
3096 2018-10-11 18:27:33 Everyone involved in boxing is suddenly either an ambassador for CBD oil or Vics nasal decongestant #CleanSport 
3097 2018-10-11 18:27:30 Quite frankly I don’t give a rats A$$ how Educated you are or anyone else ! The Oil Industrial pays really good and with Great benefits ! I most likely make more than you but don’t really care !
3098 2018-10-11 18:27:22 Double standards in dealing with ISIS vs. dealing with Saudi Arabia... both have abysmal human rights abuse records. Unlike ISIS, the KSA controls oil production and great wealth in many Western countries including the US. So life goes on as usual for Saudi! What a disgrace!

3100 2018-10-11 18:26:44 Yesterday thousands of thousands people were killed for the diamond in Sierra Leone . Thousands were killed for the oil in Lybia. As today, the millions of Congolese ppl have lost their live bc of the natural resources of their country.
3101 2018-10-11 18:26:41 I do coconut oil masks for an hour every couple of weeks - helps keep your hair strong!!
3102 2018-10-11 18:26:38 Harper was a terrible PM. Allowed foreign gov'ts to buy a portion of the oil Sands. Sold stocks at a lose to balance a budget (seriously 3.5 billion dollar loss) a billion dollar lake, a 50 million dollar gazebo. His fiscal policy was complete shit. What was good about him?
3103 2018-10-11 18:26:38 You are an idiot. Do you not think I would rather a team that wins? I would love to see the Oil be run competently.

It is not a meaningless comparison. AM isn't close to McD but TSN and Sportsnet need to constantly pump the Leaves tires because they pay the bills.
3104 2018-10-11 18:26:37 I am chilled man only if you knew :) I say same to you Sugar industry, Tobacco industry, oil industry, governments are full of scientist who lie for money. Don please listen..read..learn.. but from the right sources. Still a huge fan n very surprised u didnt block my ass yet.
3105 2018-10-11 18:26:24 'Climate change' is a phrase the oil industry initiated & promoted to deflect from the correct label Global Climatic Warming. Climate Change is a much softer term, so minimising its real destructive impact and fossil fuel producers contribution.

3110 2018-10-11 18:25:58 I don't think I'm that successful but being able to get an oil change when I'm supposed to is a step
3111 2018-10-11 18:25:28 D. Ten year at 3.14. Inflation came in soft. Oil is down to 71 now. AND the usd/China is back to 6.88. I mean it’s all the same environment from 2 weeks ago when everyone was bullish. Think about it. Huge huge fire sale. For nothing. Minuscule compared to insane drop in markets?
3112 2018-10-11 18:25:25 $69 on oil today?
3113 2018-10-11 18:25:21 I’ve been given some CBD oil. I’d like to use it to help with by my back pain. Has anyone on antidepressants or anticonvulsants been warned not to take it by their doctor? #SickNotWeak #bipolar #depression
3114 2018-10-11 18:25:19 You always get special treatment *smiling softly at you as I rub the oil between my hands, my eyes on yours as I place my hands on your chest*

3119 2018-10-11 18:24:58 Zanupf groomed us for abuse
Got us used to suffering
So our aim's survival not prosperity
So we celebrate getting $2 oil @ $4 coz it's not $18 
Also desensitised us to violence
Got us immune to horror
So when someone's shot we say ONLY 1 person died
&Continue with the jokes
Sad.

2) Use hair dryer over the shower cap to heat the oiled-up hair.
3) Wash all the oil out & dry again
4) Use hair straightener at the roots to burn anything that survived.
3122 2018-10-11 18:24:51 They're flexing their diplomatic and military muscle. Yemen war hasn't stopped us and the americans selling weapons so they've now offed a "turbulent journalist" to see if that stops business as usual. My bet is that it won't. Oil buys a lot of friendship......
3123 2018-10-11 18:24:51 I do share your concerns. However, I somehow beleive this administration is shrewd enough to balance sense with progress. We desperately need to move forward. Oil is rising. We are richly blessed. And when plug all the holes where enemies within steal all our money, we can do it.
3124 2018-10-11 18:24:50 The largest #oil IPO in 10 years is facing muted investor’s interest. With only a few days to go, @Cepsa hasn’t yet covered the offer book, which values the Spanish refiner at €7-€8 billion (IPO is for 25%) | more on @TheTerminal with @MacarenaMunozM and @RuthsDavid #OOTT

3128 2018-10-11 18:24:28 Volcanoes again: Drilling holes, like searching for oil, might alleviate pressure, while causing updrafts that could be used to spin turbinex. Also, tunneling around the volcanoes could cause cooling of the volcanoe, or volcanoes; and provide pathways for overflow.
3129 2018-10-11 18:24:26 Excited to read up on your experience with CBD oil! We hope you find relief 
3130 2018-10-11 18:24:14 He's also worried about Saudis turning off the oil spigot and the price of oil flying threw the roof hurting the economy next year. Trump a risk taker? Not even remotely.

5. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
3144 2018-10-11 18:22:27 State income taxes that we don’t pay now, higher property and gas prices, open borders, abolishing ICE, Universal health care even for illegals and our state income producing entity which is oil and gas. He’s against that. Plus he’s all in for abortion on demand.
3145 2018-10-11 18:22:20 Saudi Arabia is a hard right dictatorship that supports roving bands of thugs to beat women who they deem dressed inappropriately. They question should be, why were we ever friends with these people? 

Oh. Right. Oil.

3161 2018-10-11 18:21:02 so quick to put a label on things. 

Solar employs 370k people, compared with oil's 180k. As PV tech gets incrementally better annually, solar power gets cheaper. The more people employed in renewables => more revenue.

3175 2018-10-11 18:19:30 it's all they have. Ignore 13x6 romcom comment/oil rig fanfic/the new things.

No comment on Ford, but they are no longer going to manufacture cars, trucks only. Could be a factor
Gas is up because the price of oil is up which is good for the country
Interest rates are up because the economy is doing well.

3208 2018-10-11 18:16:10 In regards of Democrats that stereotype is usually true.
But Republicans do the same as well, just less obscure. They just do it. as we can see with Pres. Trump's Cronies on the oil industry and other buisnesses.
3209 2018-10-11 18:16:08 I can agree I missed ur point. But that’s cause you started off your tweet wrong. Tax on oil “company” isn’t same as income tax, so you can see how you did a poor job of getting ur point across.

3219 2018-10-11 18:15:17 There’s actually so much oil from paprika 
3220 2018-10-11 18:15:13 Bio oil
3221 2018-10-11 18:15:10 Ok so lemme guess you just walk everywhere bc you don’t wanna pay oil companies???
3222 2018-10-11 18:14:48 oh DUH you're right. idk why i was thinking acrylic... oil, i took an oil class too. doy.
3223 2018-10-11 18:14:47 They believe that CBD oil may be able to reduce cravings by regulating the reward system that causes the cravings. I know, personally, it has helped with cigarette addiction. #cbdhelps
3224 2018-10-11 18:14:47 Modiji's troubles and oil both may have peaked. Acche din aane wale hain ?
3225 2018-10-11 18:14:40 They should also stop buying Saudi oil.  Electric cars are even better for the environment.
3226 2018-10-11 18:14:36 Talking about ugly, how’s the oil change going
3227 2018-10-11 18:14:28 Operating criteria: 1. Correct Case pressure 2. Highest Possible Purity 3. Lowest Possible Dew Point 4. Correct Temperatures (H2 and water) 5. Low Hydrogen Usage 5. SOP is accurate and adhered to 6. Correct Seal Oil #webinar #H2 #utility
3228 2018-10-11 18:14:21 Are you guys paying $100 for your oil changes too?  #AskingForMyself

Either I haven’t been paying much attention or the dealer is getting over this time.  

$1200 for 4 tires too???  When did this happen???  Granted I haven’t needed tires until now, so I never ever knew.
3229 2018-10-11 18:14:12 @_GCFBunny_  I finally asked my roommates for their skin routines  one uses honey, olive oil, and avocado while the other uses maybe 600 dollars worth of product skdjdk they're extreme opposites
3230 2018-10-11 18:14:09 Just fell into my own book.
She kissed his neck, imbibed the sweet smell of the desert in him, the oil in his hair. “Just as I can’t have her back the way she was, I can see no circumstance in which we both exit that ring alive.” #Thurds
3231 2018-10-11 18:14:07 In that time they were able to pull off unheard of complex hacks & entrees into a bunch of US DoD’s new weaponry, while emptying the west of gold, swapping USDs for commodities globally & launching an oil contract that did in 4 mths what took Brent 20 yrs.  losing?
3232 2018-10-11 18:14:05 @realDonaldTrump Sanctions that affect Saudi oil output are BAD BAD NEWS.  If prices are high now, if Saudi oil flow reduces due to sanctions, prices will get very much higher.  $2.60 gas will easy hit $4.00 or higher
3233 2018-10-11 18:13:59 Ah, more Big Oil money for propaganda. Not buying the bullshit.
3234 2018-10-11 18:13:57 You can be sure the US is working hard not to figure out what happened w/ #Khashoggi, because they know what did, but how to make the situation sound not as bad as it really is. If its because of oil, US is worlds largest producer now, cut them loose to swim in their own swamp.
3235 2018-10-11 18:13:49 Yes true the top compones that produce these gasses are oil companies themselves which is about 40% of the total, then it’s forestries and agriculture but when t comes to cows just feeding them red algae can help reduce methane production by at least 90 percent
3236 2018-10-11 18:13:38 I think you don’t know what you’re talking about. US oil companies have been in the Algerian desert for 50+ years, and we keep hitting the country on the head because they’re in OPEC. Not easy to trick Africa, China bought the whole continent already.
3237 2018-10-11 18:13:37 I guess it’s oil you use making popcorn, honestly don’t know. Didn’t but it but thought the bottle was cute.
3238 2018-10-11 18:13:31 @KeepCanWorking more jobs in energy sector if economy focused on manufacturing and building renewable energy projects. Oil and gas get shipped out of the country and once gone, we pay to bring it back. Renewables are made here and sold direct. Make energy security a priority.
3239 2018-10-11 18:13:30 Apparently not. I was taking Cod Liver oil capsules with Omega 3 when I had a health check and I was told I was deficient in a particular type of Omega 3 only found in oily fish. I was told to eat more fish.
3240 2018-10-11 18:13:28 An oil company lawyer, involved in the BP spill disaster. Where, we should recall, BP lied outrageously, indisputably,  about the volume of oil and the effects.  Hindering the ability to react to it, to save oil company dollars.
3241 2018-10-11 18:13:28 all this coz @narendramodi has failed to destroy his enemies - the 'congress network'.

so therefore now his enemies are after him, and giving him a tough fight.
3242 2018-10-11 18:13:27 Because you were secretly hoping that a red-white-and-blue-caped superhero would leap out and pump your gas, check your oil and tires, wash your windows, and tell you it was all on the house?
3243 2018-10-11 18:13:22 I'm really excited I jumped on the beard oil train. My face smells like burning oranges in old oatmeal.
3244 2018-10-11 18:13:11 Get that tea tree oil!
3245 2018-10-11 18:13:09 “both the United States and Great Britain were very interested in the oil in Saudi Arabia!” 
id say more than just interested but go off i guess.
3246 2018-10-11 18:13:02 I hate getting my oil changed. Please just give me what I asked for and stop asking me if I want high mileage and new air filters and all of that stuff 
3247 2018-10-11 18:12:54 U mean gej stopped renewing  the oil well contracs too 
3248 2018-10-11 18:12:49 Choppies yabvisa ma price tag ese unonozvionera ku till, no sugar no cooking oil no mazoe hupfu $13/ 10kg everything going upside down...$100 usd = $550 Bond zvese bagard
3249 2018-10-11 18:12:44 Are the journalists and politicians pushing for action on Khashoggi prepared to live through the potentially extreme economic devastation Saudi Arabia/OPEC can unleash on the west? US Dollar too closely tied to oil production there.
3250 2018-10-11 18:12:41 I think it’s cause we have no bargaining power. Sometimes I really wonder the duties of the various Ambassadors to these foreign countries? It should also entail advising our country on economic relations that could boost the Nigerian economy so that their is a deviation from oil
3251 2018-10-11 18:12:30 $uso latest supply figues out today and yesterday; confirm what I have been saying for months; oil everywhere, worldwide; WTI fv 15-18 which = $uso <5 short here max position; its going lower notwithstanding "deep state" interference!
3252 2018-10-11 18:12:23 May u bring 5 bottles of cooking oil on ur way hom coz situation paden ma1 now
3253 2018-10-11 18:12:19 Takamborwira kuzvitonga kuzere now takurwira cooking oil
3254 2018-10-11 18:12:12 Yes, oil and gas is heavily taxed in DK. How is that anything but a disincentive to use oil and gas and a boon to the environment? We also tax sugar, fat and alcohol as a means to get people to consume less of those things.
3255 2018-10-11 18:11:52 I thought greed is what causes economic problems. What follows greed? Emotional roller coaster, fighting, wars then killing. Doesn't matter what it is soon as we put value on it corruption starts. We seen manipulaton fiat, stock market, oil, gold and now cryptos. Replay of greed
3256 2018-10-11 18:11:47 #IfFoodCouldTalkBack it would tell less oil
3257 2018-10-11 18:11:42 Hahaha!
Con-yay is about as black as I am after 8 hours on the nude beach slathered in baby oil.
3258 2018-10-11 18:11:32 The oil on my face is so much that I can use it to fry egg and still have some left for another day
3259 2018-10-11 18:11:25 Also I finally got a bottle that closes for my gamsol and a brush cleaner for my oil brushes
3260 2018-10-11 18:11:20 Denger2 bio oil bagus
3261 2018-10-11 18:11:16 What about all the oil and coolant and rubber wear from cars that make it into the ocean?
3262 2018-10-11 18:11:05 My surgical intern niece will be using this as her screen saver.
3263 2018-10-11 18:11:01 Stock market is down 800+ since yesterday. Oil industry needs to be replaced by renewables... its a fact that the majority of tax cuts went to the rich and corporations.. did you see Ford is dropping 24000 jobs due to his tariffs? Very selective points you make bud
3264 2018-10-11 18:10:59 Tommy is back working as a regular harbour tug today. Now tending to an oil tanker
3265 2018-10-11 18:10:58 From a global growth point of view, lower Oil is better for Europe & Asia. Don’t forget, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor because they were cut off from the global  Oil by US sanctions… unintended consequences.
3266 2018-10-11 18:10:47 Shaun baba, all that means for you an dme is after all , all politicians are 'friends' and all that rant was only to FOOL us.

by the way Obama was a BIG failure of mandate.
3267 2018-10-11 18:10:47 Maybe I'm being naive but can we stop this squabbling? A lot of us hold both UKOG & Angus, because we believe the Weald oil potential. IMO success for one is good for all, it proves the oil is there, increases credibility of all Cos and makes everyone richer
3268 2018-10-11 18:10:46 The majority of us Oil fans know how good he is. We watched him on Team NA. It’s the “Matthews is better than/equal to McDavid” arguments we disagree with. Matthews is absolutely a better goal scorer. No reason he can’t be #2 for a very long time.
3269 2018-10-11 18:10:41 O/N Wrap:
The dumping of equities continued overnight, though as the session wore on, the flow of negativity was partially stemmed by a tech-bounce; industrial commodities also under the pump - oil and metals lower; no love for the #USD, allowing #NZD to climb back above 0.6500.
3270 2018-10-11 18:10:39 You stole my lamp oil AND my rupees!
Bombs is all i have!
3271 2018-10-11 18:10:29 Its only man splaning if im a man. Which im not. So your message is invaild
3272 2018-10-11 18:10:29 But many times I desire to eat lettuce salad with tuna fish.. yummy .. You will put a little fresh onion and oil olive and lemon...
3273 2018-10-11 18:10:17 うそやんｗ
3274 2018-10-11 18:10:10 But that isnt true is it. They dont supply facts, thats the issue. They have zero experience in finance or oil industry, and are passing themselves off as experts. Certainly shouldnt be taking their view as "fact" .
3275 2018-10-11 18:10:09 Lmaooo no be palm oil omo saraki
3276 2018-10-11 18:10:05 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

3278 2018-10-11 18:10:01 I’m starting a daddy/dad rental service . I will be daddy or dad. Either for daddy  stuff, nothing outrageously weird or dad stuff like I’ll take ya fishin’ or we’ll change some oil in an old Chrysler! I’m available Sunday’s and Monday and except only money orders as payment .
3279 2018-10-11 18:09:58 4/
A) Instead of a few, more easily investigatable, prosecutable, and regulatable firms, many such firms will take their place
B) Instead of a few firms participating in information control, many such firms will, each echochambers of their own
C) As happened with Standard Oil ...
3280 2018-10-11 18:09:57 Gaskiya ne, I like the energy
3281 2018-10-11 18:09:45 Coconut oil
3282 2018-10-11 18:09:41 Ain’t no time for that fancy reading. There’s oil to be pumped and minorities to make fun of.
3283 2018-10-11 18:09:32 Kudlow is admitting that the oil price crash at the end of Obama’s term affected the economy and stock market and that Trump is simply benefiting from something he had nothing to do with.
3284 2018-10-11 18:09:25 Work on oil paintings

3294 2018-10-11 18:08:08 Well, we don’t need it to be “Vatican” either. It’s more Pious than your Vatican, Don’t play with the believes or u will regret.
Don’t feel jealous, just dig your own wells for oil 
3295 2018-10-11 18:07:52 You're not, but if it was anyone else it would be a definite no *moves to grab the massage oil* so where do you want massaging?
3296 2018-10-11 18:07:49 Canjeelo WITH oil is an abomination to mankind
3297 2018-10-11 18:07:47 No, but given our dependence on Saudi oil and their influence on oil markets, I do not expect our business dealings with them to change in the least. Our determination will be made on the basis of money over morality.
3298 2018-10-11 18:07:44 Coal plants alone (so not even counting cars, oil or gas) puts 4000 times as much co2 per year as all volcanoes combined.

That's why this is the fastest climate change in the history of the planet. And there is absolutely no other possible explanation. 

That's not how science
3299 2018-10-11 18:07:35 I know the feeling! I bought 4 new tires. Feeling good, I decided to get the oil changed. I pull out of the garage and POW, PSSST, I RUN over a metal grate! I’m guessing I felt how you must feel. IT WILL GET BETTER. KEEP YA HEAD UP!

3302 2018-10-11 18:07:22 Oil has crossed $80 and steadily climbing. Production has ramped up but CBN says were about to enter another recession.
3303 2018-10-11 18:07:19 What kind of cbd? The oil?

3309 2018-10-11 18:06:24 Well given we are so self dependent guess what the US buys 25% of its energy from Canada. Now Canada is building a oil & natural gas pipeline to the west coast to export their energy to China & Japan. We best hope they keep selling to the US .
3310 2018-10-11 18:06:21 I would pan sear Chloe up in some Olive Oil fresh Garlic until she was a perfect medium rare
3311 2018-10-11 18:06:16 it is estimated that approximately 40.0% (680,107kbpd)of the current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in. It is also estimated that approximately 29.1 percent of the natural gas production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in.

3312 2018-10-11 18:06:14 Seems that the Iranians find ways to ship their oil. Low prices, enmity to the US, other consideration, make countries continue commerce with the Islamic Republic.
3313 2018-10-11 18:06:11 Yes, exactly.. what happens when you add water to oil fires?
3314 2018-10-11 18:06:08 Isn't he also the guy who who floated the idea that all Americans should pay $4 a gallon for gas and that way they can take $2 for taxes and they'll tell the oil companies that they only get $2 a gallon for their gas
3315 2018-10-11 18:06:00 CBD oil is a popular choice amongst athletes. The oil tinctures offer an ease of use, but also a fast onset when it comes to post workout recovery. #cbd #cbdoil #discusscannabis #cannabidiol #Organic #cbdextract #cbdheals #CBDlife #hemp #hempoil #highperformance #recovery
3316 2018-10-11 18:05:58 @realDonaldTrump unfortunately this war is inevitable, and until the Iranian regime is there it will not end. Until the regime exists, peace is impossible in the world, so Iran's oil exports will be completely cut off by November 4, Iran's oil will end, the war will also end.
3317 2018-10-11 18:05:56 大爷，
Add oil, yeah ！
3318 2018-10-11 18:05:52 Aku hilang2 sendiri trs bekasnya masih dikit2 trs pake bio oil memudar
3319 2018-10-11 18:05:41 The Dickinson’s amazing. Make sure you use your cleanser and moisturizer is your best friend (coconut oil more specifically) I’ve been using all three and noticed a huge difference.
3320 2018-10-11 18:05:38 Wato ya Sani ma kenan, straight up 
3321 2018-10-11 18:05:37 I'd spent it on cooking oil, cling film, clothes pegs, squirty cream and an egg whisk. It would make for a very stimulating Tuesday afternoon.
3322 2018-10-11 18:05:31 Coba bio oil? Atau dermatix?
3323 2018-10-11 18:05:25 Notes : untuk oil cleanser, make up yang udah dilarutin 'diangkat' nya dengan cara bisa pake air. Jadi nanti bakal kebentuk emulsi. Emulsi itu 'isinya' make up kamu.

Micellar water = untuk water base make up (tipis)
Oil/milk cleanser = untuk oil base make up (tebal)
3324 2018-10-11 18:05:14 But Christine says: Non, non, non!r President
You've just nationalised oil and gas!

Christine stamps his application request with "Declined".
3325 2018-10-11 18:05:12 Prediction: oil goes up after midterms
3326 2018-10-11 18:04:58 It's about arms sales. Not oil.
3327 2018-10-11 18:04:51 Fish oil is a good one, Ive heard krill oil is really good too. Everyone needs different supplements. I take birth control and don't drink milk and rarely even eat cheese so its recommended I get a bit of calcium. You should be fine 
3328 2018-10-11 18:04:49  I was pretty surprised honestly but you can’t underestimate the power of margaritas and baby oil

3331 2018-10-11 18:04:29 Major oil producers and drillers, including Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and BP Plc (BP.L), on Thursday began returning crews to more than 90 offshore facilities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that were evacuated this week as Hurricane Michael moved through the Gulf.
3332 2018-10-11 18:04:25 Why is there a convo about beard oil in my giveaway?  by all means continue but I’m just curious
3333 2018-10-11 18:04:17 Trump just signed the Save the Seas Bill.

Conservatives believe in conservation only oil slurping swamp creatures believe Global Warming is a scam...   
3334 2018-10-11 18:04:17 Money, weapons, strategic location and oil.

3336 2018-10-11 18:04:13 Is this Blood & Oil show any good?
3337 2018-10-11 18:03:52 @SarahAnnaBowle1 Hello Sarah Anna! Did you have a nice day ? We have lovely Autumn days here ! I am happy because the price of heating oil is very expensive for me, and my house, our old family house, IS lovely, but with very high seiling ,hard to keep warm.Have a good night! 
3338 2018-10-11 18:03:48 America has been doing this for decades. Selling our soul for money and oil from this corrupt regime (while they preach radicalism that gets Americans killed). Trump is just turning it up to 11 and being more obvious about it. Should have cut our blood soaked ties long ago.
3339 2018-10-11 18:03:44 Girl, I gotta make money last til next paycheck. Girls gotta get a oil change
3340 2018-10-11 18:03:42 @MBuhari and @APCNigeria told us that before 2019  will stop importation of oil. 
From 2015 till date, no refinery in  is working, we are still paying subsidy on code, oil is still imported into the country. Why so much lies and deceit? @nassnigeria @HouseNGR @NGRSenate.
3341 2018-10-11 18:03:36 Oil painting is difficult af and when you are a clumsy person the paints are on you and not on canvas
3342 2018-10-11 18:03:30 Still stoking those 79 fires, that a half dozen SNP took down mighty Labour, as it looked to steal Scotlands oil for English socialism, fucked it over for a devolved parliament and when it was their ain that shit in the office urn as the leader admitted freely.

3351 2018-10-11 18:02:23 Chinedu Onitsha market open for the Igbos and I’m not sure you state is an oil producing state so don’t include yourself  to the Niger Deltans
3352 2018-10-11 18:02:15 They directly tax the oil at 52% and the oil companies are taxed an additional 25%. The State also owns direct interest in oil  companies. Oil rev in 2014 18 billion DKK. Contribution to GDP is not cash flow your reasoning is false. Cost to produce is $20 pb vs $36 pb in US.
3353 2018-10-11 18:02:10 Joe BIDEN's presenting BUSH w/an award for his "service to Veterans!" They should hold up a big sign that says "We're ALL invested in the same War-oil-drugs-& investment banking CLUB and YOU'RE NOT IN IT!" George Carlin said it, decades ago.
It's off the absurd-ometer!

3355 2018-10-11 18:01:56 @SaleemulHuq As scientists get climate chaos when politicians won’t, why don’t we appeal to the scientists working in oil industry, aviation etc to lead the way, protesting, refusing, striking, resigning etc? Even a few high profile people could start a movement #notwithmyspanner

3357 2018-10-11 18:01:52 I don't care if anyone goes to jail or not. As a taxpayer, I & million others will be happy, if the Govt encashes all confiscated properties, of anyone, & gives it Oil Companies; and ask them to suppress one or two hikes! That's real Democracy! 
3358 2018-10-11 18:01:43 Micellar water/oil cleanser/milk cleanser dulu baru facial wash.

Pembersih pertama itu fungsinya buat ngelarutin make up kamu yang kemudian 'diangkat' sama kapas. Setelah itu, facial wash mencuci sisa sisa make up yang tertinggal.
3359 2018-10-11 18:01:36 Pumpkin seed oil. Introduced to it last year from Austria. Amazing stuff. Good on ice cream.

3362 2018-10-11 18:01:23 No Ricin was mailed to the DoD, or Trump. It was traces of castor oil, probably from someone's fingers. In 2013 & 2014, however, right-wingers mailed ACTUAL ricin to Obama. #RealityHasALiberalBias

3364 2018-10-11 18:01:14 Media sponsors start dropping out of Saudi conference after journalist goes missing. Hit Saudi where it hursts , stop buying oil from them. Investors should all pull out. Let them rot in hell
3365 2018-10-11 18:01:06 After two weeks of unremitting stress and despair, I am back in the studio conducting successful experiments of the oil paint variety, and feeling reborn!
3366 2018-10-11 18:01:05 Yay! We just know you're going to love it, Eve. What oil/synergy are you most excited to blend it with? 
3367 2018-10-11 18:01:04 Caribbean af. Made an oil down with mine.
3368 2018-10-11 18:00:58 By that argument, everything is a luxury. Oil rig workers are a luxury because we’d rather have food than oil. Electricity is a luxury because we’d rather have food than light. Cars are a luxury because we’d rather have food than travel.
3369 2018-10-11 18:00:55 Tell me one thing the muslims did for world except sell their oil. And we had to show them how to that.

3371 2018-10-11 18:00:32 I went to a chilli fest locally funnily enough at the weekend. Spent about 30 quid on sauces and chutneys and chilli oil.
3372 2018-10-11 18:00:28 Once a day, regardless of if I’ve washed my beard or not. It’s softer, looks better, and I’m constantly getting complements.

3377 2018-10-11 18:00:05 I miss the old days when football was a game and not a business used as a play thing for these mega rich oil people. I can still remember the combined smells of Beer, Bovril and Piss coming out of the holgate. Them were the day's 
3378 2018-10-11 18:00:02 If you can't be pretty be interesting.  In other news, I have decided to take up thimble collecting after failing spectacularly at the harmonica...and oil drilling...and bespoke tailoring.
3379 2018-10-11 17:59:52 OMG HAHAHAHA ME!!! I had to check my oil for the first time in a long ass time
3380 2018-10-11 17:59:40 That's what I like to see - going camping with an oil radiator. Class.
3381 2018-10-11 17:59:34 Difference being Yes starting at 44% this time rather than 27%. May or Corbyn will do the rest. I predict a 57% yes next time now that Sterling is worth nothing and oil investment and prices are on the rise.
3382 2018-10-11 17:59:28 I dont think it affects natural gas prices like it does gasoline? Even if it did I’m sure it’d still be cheaper than oil. I haven’t turned my furnace on yet though..
3383 2018-10-11 17:59:21 They could use the massive military budget for community instead of spending on occupying other peoples countries to take their oil
3384 2018-10-11 17:59:20 Only wish I had received this sage advice before I wasted all that money on heating oil. I mean, it's plenty warm today.
3385 2018-10-11 17:58:57 hi i almost had a panic attack bc i couldn't find my sesame oil 
3386 2018-10-11 17:58:57 U.S.: Largest oil producer
3387 2018-10-11 17:58:52 Discuss cooking oil pls
3388 2018-10-11 17:58:46 You talk a lot with no concrete facts I noticed. Now you say “some tax”.

Next time don’t start by “tax on oil companies go where” cause there is corporate tax and income tax (PAYE). 
Even on your point, not all income tax goes to state
3389 2018-10-11 17:58:41 Sajid Javid announces Cannabis Oil to be available from Nov 1st. That will save the Tories sneaking off to snort coke in the Westminster toilets. They will be able to Pop a Pill without leaving their seats Haha.
3390 2018-10-11 17:58:39 No, because @RepErikPaulsen will never lift a finger against big oil. But I will ask @deanbphillips,  because I know he'll fight to protect our environment.
3391 2018-10-11 17:58:36 Canadian oil prices just collapsed, down 27% today
3392 2018-10-11 17:58:33 Time to bring out the Arnica oil

3396 2018-10-11 17:58:13 Cheers pal. Well I work in Business Development for a local company, and one market we supply into is Oil & Gas. So I’m off up there to visit existing clients, but generate new business as well (hopefully).
3397 2018-10-11 17:58:06 My oil life is at 4% . 
3398 2018-10-11 17:58:01 Sha ndebvu is expensive. Kuverwa ma edges, shampoo twice a wk, coconut oil, hair oil etc etc
3399 2018-10-11 17:57:44 Was at work without chapstick so I poured some Olive Oil on my finger 
3400 2018-10-11 17:57:40 Did you ever have Zapp's when they were 100% peanut oil? Touching the face of god
3401 2018-10-11 17:57:24 I've been told it's been infiltrated with traders shorts and Swampies.

Admin should through out.

That goes for other twitter groups to. You can spot them a mile off. If they get in block them. Get rid!!
3402 2018-10-11 17:57:23 I hate doing adult things like getting my oil changed, but also feel so responsible when I do it without my dad having to tell me to do it
3403 2018-10-11 17:57:10 And ethical oil?
3404 2018-10-11 17:57:06 Agak agak cleansing oil biore esok ada sales jugak takkk???
3405 2018-10-11 17:57:01 can't wait to see it , I bought recently a pratts oil bowser with tags on still , looks like it was originally blue what do you think ?
3406 2018-10-11 17:56:58 sell more oil - tax everyone  is the apparent plan - Paris targets are long gone
3407 2018-10-11 17:56:48 It'd be hard for them - the 1980s patchouli oil haze from Karma Crafts will take centuries to clear!
3408 2018-10-11 17:56:41 hey does snake oil actually work i’ve heard some really good reviews
3409 2018-10-11 17:56:37 Have you tried the Bvlgari Aqva oil ??
3410 2018-10-11 17:56:35 If you use CBD oil. What do you use it for?

3415 2018-10-11 17:56:22 ONGC acquired  HPCL for 36k crb from short term borrowing , HPCL has cash reserves of 12k cr so in true sense ONGC paid only 24k cr which is avery good deal for ONGC 

Through this acquisition, ONGC will become India's first vertically integrated 'oil major' company, 

Good deal
3416 2018-10-11 17:56:21 Is anyone really surprised by this?  He turned his back on his own healthcare plan when he did an against Obama. He’s a snake oil salesman like Orrin Hatch.
3417 2018-10-11 17:56:04 Yes you brake me heart and still dripping oil 
3418 2018-10-11 17:56:00 He..He..Everybody know proximity of Birla, Tata & late entrant Ambani etc. to Pseudo Gandhi Family. So at least they should not give lesson on cronyism. The biggest pvt. oil refinery is a gift to Ambani by Rajeev Ji, hope u wud recapitulate & refresh ur memory
3419 2018-10-11 17:55:43 glossier solution is really good 4 acne and it’s my fav!!!! i also use a really gentle cleanser to make sure i don’t strip my skin. and for moisturizing i use weleda skin food and leo oil which has blue tansy oil in it (good 4 acne) if u need any skin care advice i am here!!!!!
3420 2018-10-11 17:55:37 Not a beauty editor, but if you use antiperspirant it will clog your pores and will most likely lead to breakouts due to oil buildup.
3421 2018-10-11 17:55:21 Since scientists get climate catastrophe when politicians won’t, why don’t we appeal to the scientists working in oil industry, aviation etc to lead the way by protesting, refusing, striking, resigning etc?

3422 2018-10-11 17:55:16 It turns out that fish oil has the effect of reducing your risk for Alzheimer's disease.
3423 2018-10-11 17:55:10 They've been a super bad problem down south for a long time. Vinegar and dawn with peppermint oil mixed together sprayed on your windows and doors will cut them down
3424 2018-10-11 17:55:03 Heating oil prices falling rapidly this afternoon 233.96 at1:54 PM Eastern standard time down 5.53 a percentage loss of -2.31%.
3425 2018-10-11 17:54:49 Yep! Always been an Anglo American Oil Co pump and has it's brass 'property of..' tag still on it!
3426 2018-10-11 17:54:47 U.S EIA inventories: U.S domestic gains 104K barrels this week. With oil prices up, it was bound to happen. Oil starts down on the news of inventory building.
3427 2018-10-11 17:54:46 i love going in for an oil change and then they tell me my car needs a million other things that are going to cost $500+ 
3428 2018-10-11 17:54:42 It is amazing how frustrating some simple maintenance can be. Changing an oil filter on some cars requires you to have a joint between your wrist and elbow just to get to it.
3429 2018-10-11 17:54:40 “my car needs oil” lmao dump that shit all over bro 
3430 2018-10-11 17:54:39 It was imp to show US her place. US asked India to not purchase oil frm Iran. Then she forbid us to do defense deal with Russia. Earlier she asked us not to avenge d attack on Parliament, not to test nuclear bomb, not to wage war on Pak etc. Its grt that we defied them everytime.

3432 2018-10-11 17:54:17 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
3433 2018-10-11 17:54:16 ridiculous that we still have people in elected office that want to cut taxes from gas, oil, etc but that the education budget is too big
3434 2018-10-11 17:54:15 Which makes no sense since US gets most of it's oil products from Canada. It's the weapons.
3435 2018-10-11 17:54:13 My husband worked for BP North Sea oil rigs. Most of the drillers were US citizens. They take their practices all around the world. The laws that get in the way of their environmentally destructive industry swept away with pay-offs & lobbying. See: UK Infrastructure Bill 2015.
3436 2018-10-11 17:54:06 Get some beard oil 
3437 2018-10-11 17:54:01 That’s why I need new people in there. I’m draining the swamp before they sell it to oil companies.
3438 2018-10-11 17:54:00 Did #UKOG ever declare why there was no commercial flow from BB? My guess is that they ran a borehole imaging tool & found that the KL-3 and KL-4 does not have oil bearing micro fractures in all wells.
3439 2018-10-11 17:53:56 Oil has fallen by almost $5 in just 2 days without any major update on the global supply & demand.And ₹ has bounced back by >₹1 against the dollar in just a day.The only conclusion that I can draw is that these benchmarks have become purely virtual & don't represent true values

3442 2018-10-11 17:53:34 Our GDP is based on crude oil.. have you forgotten the world went into a recession and some countries are still in it ...also remember that in 2015, we where sold a lie .. the government used our excess crude account to fund the elections .. we have been broke since 2013.. check
3443 2018-10-11 17:53:28 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
3444 2018-10-11 17:53:13 Berman wasn’t a fiasco. She was requested to sit on the panel by oil execs. Should I pick apart the rest of your tweet???
3445 2018-10-11 17:53:08 Whoever created these matte lipsticks that stay on forever but are also easy to remove with oil-- you are a genius. You deserve a prize
3446 2018-10-11 17:53:04 Thanks and I squeezed lemon  on the oil so I’ll let you know how it tastes.
3447 2018-10-11 17:52:52 Both that lady and the journalist live there. She could be goofy but the info was pretty solid: oil drives the U.S war machine.
3448 2018-10-11 17:52:51 1/2 @edgarrmcgregor Have thought about Flobal Warming, US Oil Wars, Ecological system, Food Chain, so on. This is a preventable disaster but we need a government on board to research, experiment, discover & roll out a universal clean energy source for immediate integration.
3449 2018-10-11 17:52:40 Besides, this is a proposal to cut the taxes already there, not to raise taxes. If you cut taxes, then you cut funding. That's how it works. It's also mostly a tax on oil companies who pass it on to you because they can do that. Don't blame the state, blame the companies.
3450 2018-10-11 17:52:35 Truly what a people. The fight is on with the signing of another Executive Order 008. They will die fighting or forfeit all their assets. Oil well will soon expire and you expect them to chill. No way, they must run @MBuhari down.
3451 2018-10-11 17:52:15 You charge people damn near 60 dollars for an oil change(which I have no problem with) but to have somebody wait for 3 and a half hours with no explanation is atrocious @LandmarkHonda
3452 2018-10-11 17:52:14 every time i have an oil change i get the same guy - i walk in im like “sorry im late like always” he goes “its ok im used to it” . he loves me
3453 2018-10-11 17:52:13 I didn't see that, bet you're glad you have heating oil instead of natural gas now. It looks like that pipeline might be down for a while.
3454 2018-10-11 17:52:10 Absolutely- in addition, their swim bladders were used in beer/wine clarification (as isinglass), skin used for leather, fat used in oil paint and lamp fuel, and perhaps the most prized were their eggs for caviar.
3455 2018-10-11 17:52:08 That’s @Almighty_Quinta  girl putting oil on his Lexus
3456 2018-10-11 17:51:52 More boring than a North Sea oil rig in the fog.
3457 2018-10-11 17:51:36 Well that's great chief, I didn't hear a peep out of Obama on behalf of Raif Badawi. We've been cucked by SA for a long time and not just b/c of oil, so sanctions against the House of Saud aren't going to work.
3458 2018-10-11 17:51:36 right!! did her dad not show her how to put oil in her car
3459 2018-10-11 17:51:36 I'm an oil fire
3460 2018-10-11 17:51:28 IF YOU were the leader of Saudi Arabia and you needed to shore up strained relations with United States, what would you do?
* Pump more oil to cut prices
* Buy some U.S. weapon systems
* Announce major foreign investment
* Announce social reforms
* Normalise relations with Israel
3461 2018-10-11 17:51:22 Also smart enough to invest the oil Money into the future to have a solid Basis instead of giving it to the rich.
3462 2018-10-11 17:51:20 オリーブ油は、毎朝やっているテレビ番組のコーナーでも使っていたりするよね♪
3463 2018-10-11 17:51:20 It drives me bonkers, I make vats of pasta sauce with regularity, tomato puree, plum tomatoes, onion, garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper.   That's all. It is how it has been made, by hand, by Italians, for centuries. You can freeze it, or jar it and heat the jar, keeps for a year
3464 2018-10-11 17:51:03 Meat factory’s are a part of industry dumb dumb, also a lot of oil is used for transport of the meat. Agriculture is a big industry in itself, millions of people eat meat. It’s a constant cycle.

3468 2018-10-11 17:50:39 Rogue regime? Are you kidding? Do you consider KSA's war on Yemen as legal? Thousands facing death because of hunger, isn't that rogue? One journo is more important to the West? Shame on West for the dual standards on humanity.
Blood is always cheaper than oil
3469 2018-10-11 17:50:38 Wow!  You can catch it?  It usually just ends up as an oil splatter on my shirt.

3472 2018-10-11 17:50:16 Now figure it out what happens with western Bunyoro and her massive oil industry- land price in one period shot up. Government instead of handling organised housing market, fueled landlessness with homelessness now experienced in Hoima municipality
3473 2018-10-11 17:50:14 Is top down skepticism a barrier to Oil and Gas digitalisation? What are your thoughts? #oilandgas #IoT #digitalisation
3474 2018-10-11 17:49:55 Arms deals that are done at big discounts off the _costs_ of the hardware. There's no 'retail' price for military deals between nations, afaik. No 'profits' to be had in the ordinary sense. & we run trade deficits with SA, cuz oil -- which deficits Trump supposedly hates. 
3475 2018-10-11 17:49:36 He does If he puts some oil on his face, hahaha but he doesn't because highlight are not so cool
3476 2018-10-11 17:49:26 Make sure the oil you buy has all of its ingredients listed! We hope you find relief soon 
3477 2018-10-11 17:49:21 Fr newbie falling oil prices is sign of bullishness in India they forgot it implies wat OPEC today nd 2008 bear said global slowdown and sadly India will not be insulated. At 08 time too cnbc said we will not be affected. Good u atleast forwarn investormay God bless u

3481 2018-10-11 17:49:02 ”15 of the biggest heavy fuel oil burning ships emit more of the noxious oxides of nitrogen and sulphur than all the world’s cars put together.” @TheEconomist #SustainableLogistics?
3482 2018-10-11 17:49:01 transport. This last 1/3 will be hard to crack because oil offers some compelling advantages. 4/end
3483 2018-10-11 17:49:01 Oil multinationals operating in Bayelsa State what are you people doing to assist flood victims?
3484 2018-10-11 17:48:44 Anyone use Kratom and CBD oil together? Asking for a friend. #kratom #cbdoil #painfree
3485 2018-10-11 17:48:43 Socialism is superior because a meaningful carbon tax will never happen when the people who make and enforce laws are also shareholders and employees in oil corporations.
3486 2018-10-11 17:48:36 But don’t those Whole Foods store’s plastic straws come from oil from dinosaurs, which makes them organic. 
3487 2018-10-11 17:48:28 It is an excellent opportunity to meet the experts to know more about oil supplies especially in the Gulf especially from kuwait. To show technological advancement. It is good for the experts, the decision maker, for the investor, for the researcher, for the student

3489 2018-10-11 17:48:25 Why would you eat that oil,  you eat it with what vele, lol
3490 2018-10-11 17:48:10 Leave Shetland oil out of this.
3491 2018-10-11 17:48:00 What oil are you using? I'm not 100% sure but I think some of the tank people put a dye in the oil.

3495 2018-10-11 17:47:45 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
3496 2018-10-11 17:47:31 Politics is business. You have to be two-faced to survive
3497 2018-10-11 17:47:31 But how that's how you put oil in the engine right? Or have I been doing it wrong this whole time
3498 2018-10-11 17:47:31 And you will likely still support it 10 years from now. And Afghanistan doesn’t even have much oil.
3499 2018-10-11 17:47:29 The oil price is rising......November is close......
3500 2018-10-11 17:47:20 True. But Industrial Revolution V 4 is well on its way invading oil and gas industry already
3501 2018-10-11 17:47:18 The Fraser Institute.....the institute that received massive donations from the Koch family and Exxon Mobil...all powerful players in the oil and gas industries. So no bias then.......
3502 2018-10-11 17:47:17 oil well ke ...I don die
3503 2018-10-11 17:47:13 No country must ever buy SA, even if it is a World largest oil producer. Never must we sell or abandon our sovereignty. Never again.!
3504 2018-10-11 17:47:07 The peptide 4 cream oil, the peptide 4 mask and the apricot soothing toner. Though I do love the cleanse balm too! What about you?
3505 2018-10-11 17:46:53 So... all of those things happened before we used any oil... I'm not going to disagree that using fossil fuels should decrease but you are suggesting we can literally control the climate to stop them?
3506 2018-10-11 17:46:41 Norway’s Main export is “oil” 
3507 2018-10-11 17:46:21 30 bucks a week so far. My employer works in the oil/gas industry. We've seen an uptick in business. And the higher the gas prices the busier we are. So i would prefer oil to be 100/barrel. And gas at 4 a gallon. Contrary to every other person high gas $ means business
3508 2018-10-11 17:46:20 Selling snake oil. Farsical.

3526 2018-10-11 17:44:29 Isn't it his sister who is involved not him? And isn't it with the OFFSHORE oil industry, not ONSHORE?
3527 2018-10-11 17:44:24 HELL no. He sold our state out to oil and gas interests - bad idea when it comes to the future of the world, not just this country. He talks like a Dem but his policies are squarely Republican - he even fought against Universal Health Care!  Nice guy, but not president material.
3528 2018-10-11 17:43:39 My knees need an oil change
3529 2018-10-11 17:43:02 that'd require more drilling for our own oil, which I'm told by the Left, goes against environmental protection
3530 2018-10-11 17:43:00 Archaeologists have discovered an oil stain that might be more than a thousand years old.

It is Ancient Grease.

3532 2018-10-11 17:42:55 OH! Tea tree oil! Boil some water and then pour tea tree oil it and then put your head over it with a towel over you and breathe in all the steam. It stings a bit but it clears you up and feels really good on the throat. Also, sore throat spray
3533 2018-10-11 17:42:37 Yooooooo

 check your oil tho
3534 2018-10-11 17:42:36 Love how they call him a "loose cannon" when he is clearly someone with mental health issues possibly—probably, most likely?—suffering manic episodes.. Not gonna lie, am most concerned about where to get organic cold-pressed Argan oil for seven bucks if they shut down though...
3535 2018-10-11 17:42:36 not unrealistic, look at france.. did this to curb oil shock and ended up with a more efficient state
3536 2018-10-11 17:42:32 So if Turkey had oil Brunson wouldn’t have mattered?
3537 2018-10-11 17:42:22 Ordered a Sennelier oil pastel set and I just got a notification it’s at the crib, today should get interesting
3538 2018-10-11 17:42:20 So far today I’ve managed to

I feel like a real adult when I have productive days like this 
3539 2018-10-11 17:42:18 so is anyone gonna ask the president of the united states if he's cool with letting the saudis mutilate journalists as long as we get oil kickbacks or are we just letting him chill with kanye

3541 2018-10-11 17:42:05 Sadly, you REALLY do not know what you are talking about, on this.
Please do yourself a wee favour  -  and get the proper, up-to-date FACTS on N Sea oil/gas fields before looking even more of a (half Scottish) fool.
Thanks awfully
3542 2018-10-11 17:42:03 Sir, Make our economy less dependent on oil. We would be unstoppable.
3543 2018-10-11 17:41:59 Since that scary climate change report came out earlier this week, I’ve been seeing a lot of chat about how, ultimately, the solution lies with radical change to global government policies, holding oil companies to account, and toppling capitalism.
3544 2018-10-11 17:41:58 And so progressive of Norway, selling their oil into the world markets at a 50% discount to score virtue signalling points. Uh, sorry, that's Canada, not Norway. My bad.
3545 2018-10-11 17:41:56 #WCS oil is trading at $19.19 this morning, down $6.98. World oil price #WTI is at $72.00. This means we are selling Canadian oil at a discount of $52.00 US per barrel. The billions in lost revenue due to #LPC and #Trudeau caving in to FN /environmental demands #cdnpoli

3548 2018-10-11 17:41:51 It was at this oyster festival in the UK. They squeezed whole patatoes into slices that fell directly into oil. I don’t know whether it was the oil...or a specific type of patatoes....but it was far superior. Never had anything like that again.
3549 2018-10-11 17:41:27 But dat marula oil tho

3561 2018-10-11 17:40:30 @realDonaldTrump will not do a damn thing about the reporter being slaughtered by the Saudis.  Why? Personal business interests and oh yeah..oil.
3562 2018-10-11 17:40:25 Most Americans just want a level educational playing field and fair taxes for all. Have you seen Trumps taxes? Can you afford Harvard or Yale? Since when are “Dems” mining uranium and coal or drilling for oil in National Parks or Monument lands? And talk with the NRA about guns
3563 2018-10-11 17:40:19 Where do they get that oil from
3564 2018-10-11 17:40:17 That's generally because they think "socialism" means a bunch of the liberal policies (eg strong labor/enviro protections, healthcare, etc), due to the conflation in the article. They don't generally want to nationalize all the oil.
3565 2018-10-11 17:40:15 Ted Cruz is great for oil companies and bad for oil workers and everyone else.

Loss to the oil companies will be not more than 7.5k cr rupees per annum which is a miniscle amt
3569 2018-10-11 17:39:50 When she stated she was pro fracking and the oil pipelines.
3570 2018-10-11 17:39:45 I did. I even provided links. Oil & gas make up 7.6% of US GDP. They make up less than 3% of Denmark’s GVA (ie. less than that as a % of GDP).
3571 2018-10-11 17:39:36 Add rosehip or almond oil into your moisturizer, for moisturizer I recommend Palmers coco butter
3572 2018-10-11 17:39:36 Considering we have just taken out a loan do you think the Saudis we have aren't involved in the oil business?

3582 2018-10-11 17:38:56 3 hours for an oil change (I'm still waiting) and I scheduled an appt for 1030 am. I need an explanation @LandmarkHonda
3583 2018-10-11 17:38:52 MBS is being forced to end support for Wahhabism and China is forcing them to accept gold back yuan for majority of SA oil sales. That’s why khadhoggi disappeared and why we see neocons switching sides and demanding action against Saudi Arabia. They want regime change.
3584 2018-10-11 17:38:51 The 1970's McDonald's fries were hard to beat when they used beef lard instead of veg oil
3585 2018-10-11 17:38:48 I'm not sure AB would abandon oil when it still enjoys market value and profit is to be made - how would the government put a stop to private industry? However, AB would have an impressive sovereign wealth fund had not low taxes being a priority.

3594 2018-10-11 17:37:36 Plus you can resist, you can object and oppose.  Vote for politicians who are not funded by oil companies, invest your money away from those who spread terror and oppress their own people.

3598 2018-10-11 17:37:21 At least Putin has the decency to hire gangsters to murder his journalists, in order to preserve some tenuous deniability.

But the lesson of Salisbury is that you can be pretty damn blatant, if you have the oil.
3599 2018-10-11 17:37:20 So #TonyBlair said to Bush if he gave the UN route another go he would back the US whatever happened. Saddam offered France oil for their veto so UN didn’t work. I remember these things happening whatever u think about US Senate is a lie.

3601 2018-10-11 17:37:14 So imagine the riot police who arrested ZCTU leaders for planning protests, when they go home they will be queuing with everyone else for cooking oil and other basic commodities. There is no special supermarket dedicated to riot police where prices are low and stocks are abundant
3602 2018-10-11 17:37:13 If you're feeling funky in your sinuses dab a little tea tree oil under your nose and breathe deep for about 5-15 minutes. Wipe it off after or your skin will be really dry, but this usually helps me clear anything out before it really settles.

3609 2018-10-11 17:36:45 J'aime beaucoup votre "CLIMATICIDE", fallait bien trouver un mot qui fasse peur pour faire passer une taxe à 10500€ qui de toute façon ne sera pas redonnée aux autres en bonus !
3610 2018-10-11 17:36:38 Wait so coconut oil is bad for me now?
3611 2018-10-11 17:36:38 Very true. He's breaking a diplomatic norm while one of his ''senators'' complains that the media is not giving him enough publicity. OTOH, Modi may be playing along as a favor to a fellow populist. I wouldn't discount oil money quid pro quos taking place as well.

3622 2018-10-11 17:35:52 But also so foot-shootingly silly - they could have abandoned all oil and been a market/thought leader in a growing industry for the next 100 years with many more jobs/revenue. But oil ideology came first. So short-sighted.
3623 2018-10-11 17:35:47 Remember when coconut oil was the answer to everybody’s problems
3624 2018-10-11 17:35:45 Donald tRump, like all Republican Presidents, are n the pockets of the large oil Corporations and represent their interests. So they have no interest in furthering the progress of renewable energy. Ronald Reagan destroyed all of Jimmy Carter's efforts to advance renewable energy.
3625 2018-10-11 17:35:44 Hair oil LMAO I’m so ashamed 
3626 2018-10-11 17:35:37 out $gush, up only 1$(come back later)

3629 2018-10-11 17:35:31 - Using topical creams such as coconut oil will keep your skin moisturized and make stretch marks less likely.

-You can alternatively go straight for the natural product, squeezing aloe vera gel straight from the plant
3630 2018-10-11 17:35:10 Well, I’ll oil up my fist now then 
3631 2018-10-11 17:35:07 By using Sunland oil, one can have one manaivi , two thunaivi..add
3632 2018-10-11 17:35:06 @Chesfishnchips did you guys change the oil to a new kind. We went to the Torbay Rd restaurant and we weren’t too happy with flavour and color if the fries and batter. We had 2 Cod Bite Special
3633 2018-10-11 17:34:58 Yeah he's got these fish oil tablet. I've got a whole bunch so I may increase them and see if it helps, if not I may try liquid. They just come and go all of the time and idk why the keep showing up
3634 2018-10-11 17:34:50 Oh, we *should* nationalize all our natural resources—they’re ours. I was responding to the dude who thinks his personal standard of living will plummet if we stop drilling oil, he’s convinced material interest to root for Exxon, a view I cannot figure out.
3635 2018-10-11 17:34:36 Wait so joke or not? Cuz everything you said about cars is 

We support capping cars. Especially given the alarming need for climate action. Cars are the single biggest US emissions contributor.

And auto/big oil ARE a government leaches.
3636 2018-10-11 17:34:36 Oil
3637 2018-10-11 17:34:32 This is a joke right? Who the hell cares about oil or profits when everyone is dead and the planet is inhabitable due to pollution, i.e. oil. They can't be this dumb, even my 6 year knows this. He asks me, why are people still pumping oil and polluting if they know its bad?
3638 2018-10-11 17:34:24 but theres no such thing as Global warming says every multi-millionaire and OIL Magnet everywhere
3639 2018-10-11 17:34:24 Trump would have sold oil to Japan after Pearl Harbor, “because if we don’t, they’ll get it from someone else”.
3640 2018-10-11 17:34:16 Finally got my oil changed
3641 2018-10-11 17:34:07 Bio oil has changed my life! My skin be feeling like a baby’s butt lol and it cleared up my acne scars.

3643 2018-10-11 17:33:56 But is why downtown Busy Busy??? Dis oil money pass and I ain't know or wha
3644 2018-10-11 17:33:50 Went in for a $20 oil change and of course it needs more work done  pinche putos
3645 2018-10-11 17:33:47 It's like you're not even trying.
3646 2018-10-11 17:33:44 I need to get my oil changed & my eyebrows waxed while I'm home 
3647 2018-10-11 17:33:39 Possibly. You have to “love” the schizophrenic “Keep the $ alive” game. On the one hand, the U.S. is desperate to keep shale oil and gas going which means elevated prices, on the other hand that’s a real problem for gold mine operators.
3648 2018-10-11 17:33:39 Congrats!! I knew that one because I’ve seen it a billion times, but the one that killed me was “en flambé”. I knew the second I hit the “oil” button that it was alcohol. My finger jumped the gun.
3649 2018-10-11 17:33:37 Yes thats exactly it. My city was about to add rail transport until big oil and local car dealers dumped their money to campaign against it. The measure failed and we are stuck with horrific traffic.
3650 2018-10-11 17:33:31 We just got some new *Silver Hawk- Sativa- 1g Sap- Hood Oil Summit- 10109951*

3652 2018-10-11 17:33:27 I use sativa oil . Too much can make you look greasy but ya know be smart and just dab and rub . Or I use the ponds moisturizer with the WHITE CAP! It’s not too greasy I love it .
3653 2018-10-11 17:33:25 Remind me to oil the top of all the elevators
3654 2018-10-11 17:33:19 Have you melted butter on bread? Try coconut oil it’s awesome:) and bread isn’t very healthy sorry:(
3655 2018-10-11 17:33:13 This Tim's bagel tastes like lukewarm oil
3656 2018-10-11 17:32:59 Thats v true (tho what's slander in this case?). I could see some legal action against oil companies to hold them accountable for burying info in the 80s, like the tobacco companies lawsuit in the 2000s.

Still, it's notable that many of them own a lot of renewable companies.
3657 2018-10-11 17:32:51 Almost sounds calculated, if you’re a conspiracy theorist...

Joule Unlimited (of John Podesta notoriety) was financed by Russian Sberbank and Rusnano (Russian Nanotechnology interests) who sought to advance those principles here —their biggest oil&gas rivals. Coincidence?

3663 2018-10-11 17:32:30 LT food is good, even also making significant entry in edible oil industry with rice bran!
3664 2018-10-11 17:32:29 The Republican Party is afraid of facts and don't want to upset their oil lobbyist supporters.  Nor do they want to upset the industries that pollute and support their candidacies. The #environment matters.

We have not raised $1tr in revenue since 1960 from oil.
3678 2018-10-11 17:31:33 Now, between Adlife and Yaya (Lake Oil side), there's a van that purportedly sells mobiles phones. There are about 30 sales people who literally harass people. They've been there for three weeks now. Here's some interesting stuff I have learned about the whole 'business'.
3679 2018-10-11 17:31:28 I do not wanna get this oil change 
3680 2018-10-11 17:31:23 imma start carrying around oil for these heathens!
3681 2018-10-11 17:31:21 @JoeBiden word is that you're presenting an award to the Bushes. Why don't you tell them you already have plans that night? That endless war was an excuse to get oil... at the cost of so many lives.
3682 2018-10-11 17:31:16 Lower Vancouver area going to learn the importance of natural gas / oil.
3683 2018-10-11 17:31:14 Lol close! We had tofu in our Buddha bowl for Lunch. I marinated it on soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, peanut butter powder and sriracha. Fried it for about 7-8 mins (no extra oil) and wow. Wow. Oh wow.

What a people.
3686 2018-10-11 17:30:58 Media needs to stop being so alarmist on this topic 
1) US will not sanction India 
2) decision on S400 and oil was taken by govt after considering all outcomes. 

Have faith.
3687 2018-10-11 17:30:57 Coconut oil can be substituted 1:1 for other fats. It works just fine with baking.
3688 2018-10-11 17:30:49 Every extra dollar spent burning #oil is a dollar not being put to better use elsewhere.

3691 2018-10-11 17:30:36 @PhilMurphyNJ @NJGov Now that the price of oil is going up and The NJ legislatures have increased the gas tax over .30 cents a gallon, EVEN LESS people will be purchasing gas and you will collect less tax. And it will cost residents and businesses that need to drive more $$ 
3692 2018-10-11 17:30:35 So your just going to ignore connors COACH for 2 guys who fit your opinion, classic. Stick to fighting for the government to get some oil and leave the internet with people with atleast 100 iq

3700 2018-10-11 17:30:06 I have returned the car today. To be told you do not check oil levels or tyre pressures before delivering cars. Disgusting You are putting peoples lives in DANGER by not doing these checks if you were more concerned about safety than charging for damage there wouldn’t be an issue
3701 2018-10-11 17:30:02 Think about it!  NM needs people in Congress and the Roundhouse who are free of oil influence. Not Steve Pearce. @XochforNM, #nmpol @Michele4NM @NOPearce4NM

3703 2018-10-11 17:29:54 I was supposed to get an oil change a wholeeee month ago. Just now getting one 
3704 2018-10-11 17:29:50 When you have to call off to get an oil change cause you that busy and you on 5% life lol
3705 2018-10-11 17:29:45 The difference is PMB is working for Nig & Nig's but others they are coming to loot just as they stole the money they use in building university, hotels in dubai the wealth they have today.. just cos of oil well they team-up against PMB!
3706 2018-10-11 17:29:44 Shetland islands, if independent would be an enclave with an economic zone that stretched roughly 12 miles off shore in all directions. There is no oil within 12 miles of Shetland. Don’t be silly.

3720 2018-10-11 17:28:25 1/2: If you cared, really cared, about the environment and the future of our country, you'd extend the EV tax credits. All told they pale in comparison to annual oil subsidies ($5bln *total* vs. $20bln *annually*). EVs are the future for transportation, and the future is here.
3721 2018-10-11 17:28:24 Palm oil and orange essence. Not what they used to be.

3723 2018-10-11 17:27:52 what about the health impact of palm oil? why not replace that ingredient with a more sustainable and healthy alternative?

3729 2018-10-11 17:27:15 Didn't know that Saudis needed to import oil.  As for US, S.A. ships to Europe more than US.
3730 2018-10-11 17:27:15 Water and oil. A Morena's best friend.
3731 2018-10-11 17:27:09 IMO a thriving economy is a better environment (no pun intended) in which to push renewables. To do so at the nadir of a recession and snails pace recovery was unwise. We have an abundance of oil/gas. We can leverage profits from those resources to push towards renewables.

3734 2018-10-11 17:26:56 Yes, the earth is dying, I have an idea, let’s put a tax on it.   We need to build that goddamn pipeline, Canada has  the cleanest oil on the planet, it is conflict free. Saudi oil is blood oil. Name me a country with cleaner oil than Canada

3736 2018-10-11 17:26:43 Governments need to contain big oil and maybe put him on a diet
3737 2018-10-11 17:26:31 It’s dumb polluted because of the greenhouse effect. We are burning too much of the earths fossil fuels. Which translates to us using coal, oil etc. The second reason is because of agriculture.. which is the nasty mass farming of animals that y’all eat

3739 2018-10-11 17:26:13 Looking for a sugar daddy but specifically to pay for my gas and maybe the occasional oil change
3740 2018-10-11 17:26:10 some of the companies don’t sell directly to consumers: a gas station buys from the oil company, and I hope nobody is buying coal directly lol. We can try our best, but it will have very little effect...

3757 2018-10-11 17:24:30 finally see what?, all I see are a corrupt right wing set of kleptocratic racist bankers with shares in oil/plastics refinery trying to stop the world moving to renewable energy because it would hurt their bottom line (and i'm not even a lefty)
3758 2018-10-11 17:24:28 Rich country like Venezuela:Does socialism. 
*10 years later, the country is ruined* blame USA and the Socialists abroad: “This is not REAL socialism, it’ll work NEXT TIME!”
PS Open a book wont harm you to learn that Venezouela imports oil while it has the biggest oil riches!
3759 2018-10-11 17:24:25 @GOP he puts money over a US resident, you cool with this? We sanctioned Iran for what again? Iran gave us easier access to oil yo

3765 2018-10-11 17:23:53 Would you prefer they buy them from Russia? How about an oil import tax instead.
3766 2018-10-11 17:23:52 We don’t want Germany to buy oil from Russia. Yet we’re letting Russia shoot our butts in to space for 75 million a pop? Are we getting our money back for this one?

3774 2018-10-11 17:22:50 Someone dropped a whole TON of eucalyptus essential oil in their office, which is right outside of mine. I was cool with it at first and because it was funny, but now coupled with being tired...I have a headache, I’m sleepy and I wanna go home. Send help...
3775 2018-10-11 17:22:49 Guess you also enjoy polluted beaches, earthquakes from fracking, collapsing roads from oil and water trucks, and air pollution. Your children and grandchildren are the ones who will pay for the mess the GOP are creating.

3781 2018-10-11 17:22:21 Watch how people that bashed the Economist when they declared the lifeless one will lose the 2019 elections, come here to masturbate on on the recent write up. Even if Atiku is coming to Rob CBN, assign all oil wells to himself or even to Islamise me, my vote is for him

Obasanjo
3782 2018-10-11 17:22:20 Also, there is of course the ever present Middle East concern, OIL.
3783 2018-10-11 17:22:17 We are building a second pipe line to ship dirty oil offshore
But it turns out we only have one pipeline that most of BC relies on for Natural Gas .
This does not make sense
Conserve Natural Gas till it is fixed please
3784 2018-10-11 17:22:17 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
3785 2018-10-11 17:22:06 Still not understanding what this has to do with affordable education and healthcare. In addition I think you are full of crap because ai can't find any source about Venezuela providing hesting oil to NY residents.
3786 2018-10-11 17:22:06 Try live crude oil just look up live crude it has done wonders to my skin
3787 2018-10-11 17:21:59 It's disgusting that they're taking oil money in the first place for a show where women are banned. The fact the Saudis are killing journalists is just another reason why it's so disgusting. WWE is an absolute joke. Glad I'm not watching them anymore.
3788 2018-10-11 17:21:53 A simplistic view of the issue. But as usual, no suggestion of how to remedy the situation. just bluster. A pipeline is not the only answer, why is that the only focus? What do other counties do with their "landlocked" oil ? This is becoming is more about politics than solutions
3789 2018-10-11 17:21:52 I just bought a cool new GoPro Camera! The electric car was killed by Walt Disney! No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
3790 2018-10-11 17:21:52 It will remain unchallenged as it's been reported that as much as 6% of the US economy is Saudi oil money.  If the Saudi's pulled there money US econ would collapse.  Ever wondered why first gulf war happened. Even though Bin Laden was a Saudi living in pakistan they attack Iraq?
3791 2018-10-11 17:21:48 Is bar keyboard ko tale (oil) nahi lagana??

3793 2018-10-11 17:21:39 I informed the @mssocietyuk over a year ago of the benefits I had experienced from using cannabis oil and was totally ignored there was no interest now look is it more about politics than really helping people with ms that concerns you or do you just want credit now

3796 2018-10-11 17:21:35 Oil and Military Industrial Complex. Anyone, US Citizens, Yemeni Civilians, Saudi Citizen hurt in this US Saudi Alliance is just considered collateral damage. There will be a lot wringing of hands and show legislation and then it’s back to business as usual.

3800 2018-10-11 17:21:25 yeah your skin will probably take some time to adjust! it can be quite drying too get you a good oil that works for your skin (i use jojoba)
3801 2018-10-11 17:20:56 When the political equation; 
Obasanjo + Atiku = 1

It implies that;
Buhari + 2019 = 0

As a result, the following variables will be altered accordingly:

Security = 81%
Peace = 85%
Jobs = 82%
Economy Strength = 80%
Currency Strength = 78%
Agriculture = 60%
Dependent on Oil = 30%
3802 2018-10-11 17:20:46 Oh and in case you didn't know, we have advocates, MANY advocates for Christian law in the US, but our region has not been destabilized by wars paid for by oil corporations, so it cannot take effect.

3804 2018-10-11 17:20:31 Don't know if you've read "Big, Fat Surprise." Shows the "Med Diet" is a fiction created by flying academics to Tuscany in the early  90s for wine-soaked junkets financed by olive oil growers. Humans have virtually no co-evolutionary with OO - how can it be the only healthy fat?

3810 2018-10-11 17:20:06 Nice to know one of the leads in the UN are behaving in such a way? Also want blaspheme laws imposed on all UN countries! Happy days ahead! Has no one worked out yet, "What the fcuk will Saudi do when the oil runs out"?
3811 2018-10-11 17:20:05 We offer CBD that’s lab tested to have Zero THC, so there’s guaranteed no High, we also have lots of happy customers using our oil to relieve anxiety! Good Luck! Hope you find some relief!!

3814 2018-10-11 17:19:57 I work for an oil and gas company but I have an electric mower, leaf blower, edger. Issue even with electric things is electric plants use petroleum coke, natural gas and coal to still power them. I’m all for green energy even with my job in oil
3815 2018-10-11 17:19:57 Also Kaabi of @qatarpetroleum: "...it doesn’t make sense that you could get rid of so much [oil and gas] volume unless you give me a solution that is different from just renewables"

I have a solution - use less energy, travel less/slower, transport goods less far...

Dude was a Saudi citizen critical of crown prince, who is authoritarian but trying to modernize Kingdom, veer away from Wahabbism & tried to root out corruption. No need for S.A. oil but geopolitically tough to alienate ally in region.

Now they are supplying Hemp oil which is creating false hope to millions and the price paid will be massive to the NHS.

I am now lighting a candle in every room.
3830 2018-10-11 17:18:33 Hate needing an oil change/maintenance I feel guilty driving anywhere even if it’s just for work.
3831 2018-10-11 17:18:25 just because there are some downfalls to veganism (palm oil, extra plastic, etc.) doesn’t mean it isn’t MORE beneficial to live that way.  companies are the ones who won’t change

3836 2018-10-11 17:18:06 Pls go and check and get back to me on it and you wold be shocked, we had people who where making billions of oil they never brought into the country, this man came and stopped it and yet it is him we are fighting, yes PMS is a bit more expensive but its availble
3837 2018-10-11 17:18:02 @DailyZeitgeist That study on 70 companies' emissions assigns the blame for climate change to the extractor (every company on the list is a fuel producer). It is NOT a reason for consumers to offload the blame--consumer behavior determines how much oil gets taken from the ground.

3856 2018-10-11 17:16:28 Have a lot of clients that are using CBD to help with those issues and having great success. The trick is always going to be finding the right dose for your system. Start low, say 4mg and increase from there. And of course be sure you’re getting CBD and not just hemp oil.
3857 2018-10-11 17:16:25 axel's so nice..! i just hope he doesn't trip over all that oil..;;
3858 2018-10-11 17:16:24 Everyone in this country is subject to the same nonsense from the government. Do you really think it will be paradise if you split. You can't see its just about a few other people trying to take control of what's left of the oil. Or do you think they really care?!
3859 2018-10-11 17:16:20 Either use oil or it’s the leggings lol
3860 2018-10-11 17:16:16 You don’t use oil! Put the food in it it should have settings based on the type of food you cooking it’s basically a mini oven lol
3861 2018-10-11 17:15:59 I hate finding slides through oil immersion
3862 2018-10-11 17:15:54 I think the Iranians are good people US should be more friendly with them as they too have oil. But on the other side the Saudi’s are the real sponsors of cross border terrorism. 9/11 Attack is enough to prove their involvement. But trump is cozying up with these dictators.
3863 2018-10-11 17:15:53 argh....had a horrible night sleep and now im late to go drop my car off for oil change....gotta rush...this sucks

3869 2018-10-11 17:15:13 @VP Before oil brother nations about every 14 years on average running 7 to 20 had massive wars that essentialy controlled their populations. After oil they grew large and became terrible problems for their leaders and countries around them now have become refugee crisis

3909 2018-10-11 17:12:32 Oil, mostly; oil that is extracted and sold gradually. They are also not socialist, speaking quite strongly on the subject; they consider themselves a social democracy instead
3910 2018-10-11 17:12:31 Norway is enjoying the wealth that they established nearly 30 years ago with the Pension Fund Global and have made a killing in the stock market. Scotland will be starting at the bottom and those rich oil reserves will be fought over, once the break up has begun.

3916 2018-10-11 17:12:07 Trump can trample anything that comes his way. He is crazy but he is also the most powerful President of world''s only and only Superpower. India has created a vacuum for itself by going for Russia''s S-400 missiles   thinking of going ahead with Iran''s oil supply.

3919 2018-10-11 17:11:56 NGOs, @IcelandFoods @IcelandRichard @Greenpeace @RainforestTrust @RAN do not care about the 650,000 small farmers when promoting Palm Oil smear campaigns. Shameful. Malaysian small farmers need a livelihood to provide for their families, too.
3920 2018-10-11 17:11:55 Louis CK used to do a great bit on this. . .before the “trouble” surfaced. . .about god coming back, looking around, and scolding us: “what did you do???? I gave this (the earth) to you as a gift! Look at the penguins. . .what is this black $#!t they’re covered in? Oil??”
3921 2018-10-11 17:11:46 @NutellaUSA @NutellaGlobal do something about deforestation by taking palm oil out of your ingredient list #taketheinitiative
3922 2018-10-11 17:11:40 scales of some sort... if it is inside plant you can use an insecticidal oil or soap but if it is an outside plant that will burn the leaves... otherwise you need to use a systemic insecticide applied to the soil for uptake into plant for insect to feed on it...

3927 2018-10-11 17:11:08 I HATE the feeling of dry lips. One day I left the house with a different purse than usual and it didnt have chapstick in it. 

I had moisturized my scalp just before I left the house so I touched a little just along my edges and wiped the little bit of hair oil onto my lips.

3933 2018-10-11 17:10:52 Oil Prices retreated as global markets fell, with investor sentiment becoming less frantic due to an industry report showing U.S. crude inventories rising more than expected.
3934 2018-10-11 17:10:42 It's all about the oil wells about to expire, the foreign reserves, the recovered loots, they will go to any length to continue their evil ways but we will not allow them!!!

3945 2018-10-11 17:09:45 Unless you refer to debates on Mifid or olive oil in restaurants? Yez.
3946 2018-10-11 17:09:44 NGOs wrongful attempts at criticising Palm Oil are not new. @Greenpeace’s @andyrtait untruths on orang-utan population #’s is emotional blackmail to boost fundraising campaigns. FACT: Orang-utan are protected species in Malaysia. IUCN reports estimate 104,000 Borneo orang-utan.

3949 2018-10-11 17:09:33 Of course he won’t. He’s mortified they’ll shut off the oil valve and cause him and the GOP even more problems before nov 6.
3950 2018-10-11 17:09:19 the high price is because Gov is not paying as much subsidy as b4, and marketers were allowed to set thier price, the reason why we have more fuel before, during GEJ they got subsidy and then take the oil to other countries to sell and sort out our officals

I have read that Tar Sands is TOO DIRTY for our use, it is all exported. Obama repealed the 40-yr ban on oil exports for them in Dec 2015.  So we are told lie after lie. smh

3975 2018-10-11 17:05:56 It's only going to get worse until you wise up on climate change. We need to cut carbon emissions. That means stop burning coal. Promote electric vehicles and solar/wind energy. Even big oil is alarmed at climate change. Get a clue, dotard.

4004 2018-10-11 17:03:40 Oooooh I have coconut oil already! Does it leave the inside of your mouth feeling extra oily and lubed up tho?
4005 2018-10-11 17:03:32 I love chicken and duck combo but this will do. Wild duck is the best but hard to get enough meat sometimes.

4015 2018-10-11 17:03:02 Shetland has never expressed even the slightest interest in separating from Scotland. IF it did, it would take oil within its own waters which are only 20 miles, a tiny portion of SCOTLAND'S oil. Please learn to look stuff up - or stop lying. One or the other.
4016 2018-10-11 17:02:46 Have you not noticed that the 1% do not share their wealth? Why do you think, unlike Zuck or Musk, whether the oil tycoons have 1, 10, or a 100 billion dollars a piece affects your standard of life? What revenue would you stop getting if the drills stopped tomorrow?
4017 2018-10-11 17:02:29 if we had to stop living our pretentious and fake lives and say fight for our life with no cell service, no grocery stores, Marshall law, etc... 99% of my peers would be dead in a week because they don't even know how to change the oil in their car for example lol #dailythoughts

4025 2018-10-11 17:01:58 Your country is the one who believes in violence and attacking innocent Muslim kids and stealing their resources so you can eat food. Don't you ever forget how manu Muslims are out of their own beloved countries because of the war your country brought so they could steal oil.
4026 2018-10-11 17:01:40 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

4028 2018-10-11 17:01:28 I always look dumb getting my oil changed because they always ask me questions about my car and I'm like "um ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ "

4035 2018-10-11 17:00:52 a mixture of Palm oil, rice bran oil and musterd oil is quite common and can be found easily at all kariana stores.

4037 2018-10-11 17:00:35 Did you know that the cabin air filter helps keep the vents and climate control system working properly? It’s always a good idea to have this filter checked whenever you get an oil change.
4038 2018-10-11 17:00:29 They were behind the 9-11 attacks and are behind all the radical terrorist groups in the Middle East, the US is well aware of this, but says nothing because of the Oil connection and its few remaining allies in the region! Disgusting to say the least!! #barbaric #politics

4041 2018-10-11 17:00:22 I agree. In a global economy, you have to try & account for how every action impacts other countries/the world. That's why nothing should be rushed into & we need to be practical in how we go about it. Oil will run out eventually, so when that happens, let's be ready for that.

4053 2018-10-11 16:59:41 If arm sales or anything impacting oil market is off the table the only real options left are wrists on the slap. The magnitsky action could be taken against individuals (aka 15 "tourists") cutting them off from the US but unless MBS targeted (very unlikely) it would be a joke.

4060 2018-10-11 16:59:12 Snake oil  is the only solution 

Go for a short walk, that should help.
4061 2018-10-11 16:59:08 may I add making popcorn using the bacon fat. I find the popcorn to be extra crispy vs using standard oil. The suttle bacon flavor just makes it even better.
4062 2018-10-11 16:58:59 I’ve been in my Ari Lennox/Ravyn Lenae/Quin/Bosco/Malia/Van Jess bag lately. Between them and my scented oil diffuser and purple lights, I am calmer than I’ve ever been.

4064 2018-10-11 16:58:54 Oct 11 2015 Trump Tweeted.."I can't believe we left Iraq without the oil.."
4065 2018-10-11 16:58:53 The problem is US accounts for less than 15% of all global carbon emissions. China plus India = 2x US production and as they grow and US declines, that gap will grow. How to convince US Oil producers and Oil Users to accept higher costs when US alone cannot fix problem?

4069 2018-10-11 16:58:19 I hear this alot that Buhari has blocked oil licences renewal of the owners of Nigeria and I ask, did he give it to the masses? Did he approve resource control which gives it to the Niger Deltans and states? Is it not his friends and family who have the oil wells today?
4070 2018-10-11 16:58:17 Last time i checked 3 hours is a long time to get an oil change done... i should know i do them for a living
4071 2018-10-11 16:58:04 But what is @realDonaldTrump doing to stop OUR nation from treating the ocean as a dumping ground?He gutted the EPA,he’s promoting off shore oil rigs, he’s deregulated every agency that protects our oceans.Walk any beach, and the amount of plastic debris makes you want to scream!

@Anjali11Anju oil Ka naam bata 
4081 2018-10-11 16:57:27 We sprinkle holy oil on things to make them work properly or avoid tragedy. Remember last year Dec, Racheal Ruto exorcising  "devils" at Salgaa then before her holy oil dried, another accident happened.
4082 2018-10-11 16:57:26 Yields cooling off, gold is surging. May be bond market is now factoring in global slowdown coming quarters. Brent oil is also cooling in that anticipation. So this time lower yields will not benefit equities but harm them.
4083 2018-10-11 16:57:20 He's a heckuva a player, not near as good as McDavid, but certainly on his way to being the clear-cut No. 2 on the totem pole.

4088 2018-10-11 16:57:04 Govt is doing testing in the time of turmoils, Simple solution was ask OMC's for dividend pass and use that to reduce center tax on #oil prices that way reform theme won't get hit and OMC's not loose -25% price cut in one day.. 
Now let's see how they reimplant FCNR back for RS.

4091 2018-10-11 16:56:49 Its a lot that goes at the back than just the chips and chicken that you see at the front.....for example spices are imported, flour dhololo can't get it anywhere....cooking oil dhololo....then potatoes and chickens ...
4092 2018-10-11 16:56:49 Hah! One of my audit clients was an oil distribution co. At least the smell of the oil blocked out the cellophane smell.

4094 2018-10-11 16:56:35 So, you think the rest of Texas isn't on board with education,  healthcare,  social security,  environment....just oil and gas. I worked for a small oil n gas company.  When our gas prices rose, you better believe they were rewarded with huge  profits. What did we get
4095 2018-10-11 16:56:32 It’s supply and demand. Refineries have ample supply of better quality oil from other sources. Even paying a higher price they’re able to produce more refined product with less waste which means more profit.
4096 2018-10-11 16:56:28 Put them on the "travel ban"?
Oh but wait....the oil. 
4097 2018-10-11 16:56:26 I don't believe it's doable to exclude other options right now. We still need oil, nuclear & so on. I think tho that we should continue to expand the renewable energy sector as it creates jobs, saves ppl money over time (solar panels, electric cars, etc...) + energy independence.
4098 2018-10-11 16:56:26 So who did Buhari give the oil wells? The masses? Which people exactly?

4125 2018-10-11 16:54:31 Hi, it would be interesting to see a break down on each state's gasoline taxes, the federal gas tax is the same for all states, and the uderlying retail oil company price.

4132 2018-10-11 16:54:00 I agree that the problem is urgent. I just disagree that its the producers of energy who are the only ones causong the problem. Every time we use energy - drive, fly, heat our homes - we have to own those impacts. It's not the oil companys' exclusive fault that we use oil.
4133 2018-10-11 16:53:54 Is that tonight’s vegetable oil bottle I spy. Have fun but obviously not as much as last night 
4134 2018-10-11 16:53:46 Hahaha yeah tuh oil emang super. Sudah jadi salah satu item wajib kalau traveling  sorry #latereply haha jarang buka twitter sekarang
4135 2018-10-11 16:53:45 The Fed is simply reacting to Trump's inflationary policies - late cycle tax cuts and increased govt spending, Iran sanctions (oil prices) and increases in the cost of production on pretty much everything due to his trade wars.
4136 2018-10-11 16:53:40 But most True Albertans (tm)  would be hard at work in the oil patch at that time! #ableg

4145 2018-10-11 16:52:50 Yes, your idea to let the Iranians stop SA from selling oil is fucking stupid.
4146 2018-10-11 16:52:34 Use coconut oil or almond oil or olive oil!
4147 2018-10-11 16:52:32 Would it be easy to change the oil yourself with common garage tools? Or are there various drain plugs in difficult places to ensure the entire block gets drained?

4154 2018-10-11 16:52:11 Expanding the ACA would eventually cost OK money, but there was a 10 year gap to figure that out. The intention, I think, was the work it into the budget. As we know, however, OK can’t write anything in bc we’re broke. And we’re broke bc we refuse to adequately tax oil and gas.
4155 2018-10-11 16:52:07 dig this oil slick boy
4156 2018-10-11 16:52:04 Okay Texans this is how stupid Cruz, Cornyn & Abbott think you are. Cruz ad stated Beto voted with Nancy 2 raise barrel of oil by $10 per barrel. Now Beto isn't currently a politician that can vote 2 approve anything except his ads. Cruz, Cornyn & Abbott can & did.

4159 2018-10-11 16:51:36 No, I hadn't, I work so dont have access to much news during the day. This admin has opened up drilling in the oceans and public owned lands which you'd think I'd be ok with since I'm in oil and gas but I'm not because I see first hand the damage it does to our land and water.
4160 2018-10-11 16:51:26 I swear canjeero without oil is worse than chicken without seasoning
4161 2018-10-11 16:51:22 It’s not all tax. The oil companies are required to make a summer mixture and winter mixture in CA for less pollution. So our refineries have to do more work, and they charge higher prices too. The oil cartel plays a lot of “shortage” and “broken refinery” games as well.
4162 2018-10-11 16:51:14 Everyone knows IRGC will sneak some oil around and sell it, what all are looking for is oil contracts being signed
4163 2018-10-11 16:50:56 Do they have oil in their country?

4165 2018-10-11 16:50:34 See them, the crude oil price hike is now a concern to govt. But when the price was down, did we enjoy low petrol prices o...?
4166 2018-10-11 16:50:32 what boost an economy more ? lower oil prices or lower int. rates?
4167 2018-10-11 16:50:32 There’s also a balancing act. Oil prices are valued acc to US dollar. Devaluing oil as a commodity has ramifications.

4170 2018-10-11 16:50:13 Yup. Once I started using cannabis oil medicinally to help cope with the side effects of my cancer treatments, my doctors admitted basically the same thing. They don’t think it’s harmful, but they can’t really answer my questions.

4173 2018-10-11 16:49:59 Because he's using them to help manipulate the oil commodities market.  Trump's an unbelievable idiot.

4175 2018-10-11 16:49:52 Here's a recipe for an italian sauce for salads and vegetables or anything really:

3 parts of olive oil 
1 part of vinegar
1 part of soy sauce
Add your favorite spice " a gosto".
That means how much you want it
Mix it.

Voilá! You will eat more vegetables by having a nice sauce.

4189 2018-10-11 16:48:57  just found out there’s a smoke free ricks in odessa (oil town)  uhhh my lease is up in february. feesl like I should at least try
4190 2018-10-11 16:48:53 Where's that number come from? A @NissanElectric LEAF is only $40K if new, and $15K if used. Then take your fuel bills, divide by 5, and add to your electrical bill instead. Subtract your oil changes too.
4191 2018-10-11 16:48:53 Am thirsty i need a litre of annointing oil 
4192 2018-10-11 16:48:52 It dose help me sleep better a bit more relaxed than if I didn't use it .if your asking if it's the same as weed or thc oil then nowhere near it I know as used to smoke thc until my chest couldn't take it anymore lol

4195 2018-10-11 16:48:34 Have you researched what chemicals and gases are produced as a by-product of oil refinement and usage of coal products and what effects it has on our atmosphere? If so what are your findings? You can’t refute someone’s findings if you yourself haven’t done proper research.

4200 2018-10-11 16:48:05 Of all the gel's I've ever used on my hair, the EcoStyler Gel with Olive Oil is unmatched. It's one of the few products I've purchased that has honestly lived up to the hype. My hair loves that shit. My curls are still super defined (today I'm at day 3) and not crunchy at all.

4207 2018-10-11 16:47:21 What they won't print is thanks to Donald Trump we are no longer dependent on foreign oil we get it all from our own country now. Funny how the mainstream press is dead silent on all of the accomplishments he has made!

4210 2018-10-11 16:46:51 so i tried the 73 and it does make an exceptional product but it seemed a little waste ful to me i ended up using the 220 and if you get the timing right you end up with allot more material that is still blonde and looks like it will be great for rosin and some canna oil!

4213 2018-10-11 16:46:39 Us either! Lmao we do oil sometimes during the day but we dont even smoke blunts at night anymore. Last night we did for the first time in like 2 weeks and i was dead lmao

These are some screwed up individuals!
They have zero idea of what masculinity is, yet they think masculinity is bad?!?
I’m guessing none of these “men” know how to run a chainsaw or change the oil in a car/truck.

4226 2018-10-11 16:45:35 The dumb argument is that Canada ALONE can make any difference even if the snake oil science of global warming is true.  China and India don't care and will never care about virtue signalling. They have bigger problems.
4227 2018-10-11 16:45:30 The US is addicted to Saudi oil & has become its whore to pay off its debts from building up its military to protect overseas business assets. The Saudis have pimped out the US for decades & only now the common American can see the sick abusive relationship for what it is.

4237 2018-10-11 16:44:07 Who was paying for the oil subsidy of 1.3 L crs during UPA?  Was God writing a cheque in benevolence? Oil companies on the one hand and the higher inflation due to higher CAD and higher taxes. Educate yourself.
4238 2018-10-11 16:44:03 Especially when they have common enemy....oil well and tax on overseas income...enough to unify these  people.

4240 2018-10-11 16:43:55 Don’t try and play me. I know the oil goes straight into the flux capacitor
4241 2018-10-11 16:43:49 False, E15 has been blocked by the oil lobby.  Do you think Benzene and Toluene are better for air quality?
E15 lowers tailpipe emissions and is a lower RVP fuel than E10.
4242 2018-10-11 16:43:47 Omg  it's honestly a pretty long list. I'll send it to you when I can. But in the mornings all I do (and had on for this pic) is a lil sunscreen, coconut oil lotion, and a pump of argan oil all mixed in my palm. :)
4243 2018-10-11 16:43:46 I promise that even when you learn how to change oil, you'll just want to take it in to get it done regardless.

4245 2018-10-11 16:43:42 The four days off will really benefit the @EdmontonOilers to have time to regroup and get on track which the Oil cannot afford to go 0-2-0 to start the season so this is a confident team that is looking to right the ship tonight in Beantown against the @NHLBruins #LetsGoOilers

4247 2018-10-11 16:43:30 Dude, unclear.  When would the Saudis lack oil?  They'd have it out the yingyang, they simply couldn't sell it.  Install a less sword-loving, journalist-killing, typhus-spreading govt and I'd send the USS Harry Truman to Hormuz lickety split.

4254 2018-10-11 16:43:10 Obviously it does. Otherwise OU and Texas could hit up a couple of oil barons and have all of that themselves.

a) non-scientific political garbage;
b) trying to find SOMEthing after @TheDemocrats shameful lying about @BrettKavanaugh ;
c) US oil industry is the MOST efficient in reducing CO2

4261 2018-10-11 16:42:53 The Saudi's are clearly only our friends as long as we buy oil and vice versa. Our drug is middle east oil and like buying drugs, we have to stray into a bad neighborhood. It is key to all of our bad experience with the middle east including 9/11 which was perpetrated by Saudi's.

4264 2018-10-11 16:42:38 2.) You’ll be forced to make a shitey deal with the EU, because you need them more than they need you. It’s American money that extracts oil, so good luck getting them to cough up more
4265 2018-10-11 16:42:33 People are so brainwashed about marijuana from laws made in the 1930s because William Randolph Hearst wanted a monopoly on the newspaper industry. Hemp stalks are great for construction, the CBD oil extracted is proven to stop various medical conditions including SEIZURES..

4276 2018-10-11 16:41:24 How about coconut oil together with mct oil. Does it really help with Alzheimer?
4277 2018-10-11 16:41:17 Usually, the brine adds most of the flavor you need, but I like to put oil on the skin and some butter under the skin with a sprinkling of paprika on skin. Definitely nothing with more salt.

4282 2018-10-11 16:41:02 Please don’t say that. I think they all realise this is the last gasp of big oil. They’re all, trump/GOP/ and Russia/SA, etc. Are trying to get rich before it all HAS TO STOP OR WE ALL DIE!

4301 2018-10-11 16:39:24 essential oil diffusers are the potpourri and home interior candles of our generation
4302 2018-10-11 16:39:23 I use any brand as long as it’s plain vitamin E oil and nothing else
4303 2018-10-11 16:39:20 Shetland was a dump before the 80s. If it wasn’t for the oil, BP and the influx of Jobs, plus and the hefty financial kickbacks it wouldn’t have seen much prosperity from Westminster. They took their slice and didn’t care for lives either - eg Piper Alpha.
4304 2018-10-11 16:39:12 Washington state succeeded in helping shut down canadian tankers while protecting american tankers. USA continues to buy canadian oil at extreme discounts; we’ve already given up billions to USA! what more could Washington state want from BC?
4305 2018-10-11 16:39:08 Big Oil propaganda similar to big tobacco strategy makes sense for their business and the politicians they have bought & paid for- but the dumb idiots who have no stake in the game that don’t believe in science are astoundingly stupid
4306 2018-10-11 16:39:06 Stahp mansplaining that's ignorant
4307 2018-10-11 16:39:04 Oil is always smelly...and ownership always Really Greedy.
4308 2018-10-11 16:38:59 @Ostroski_BigO so if Alabama, a relatively poor state with no oil can have all of that, why doesn't OU and Texas have all of that? #ItJustMeansMore
4309 2018-10-11 16:38:59 Vaseline. Coconut oil (when its still hard. Looks and feels like chapstic) a little water every 30 minutes lol 
4310 2018-10-11 16:38:50 There's a lot more to it than that, hence the bloomberg interview guy highlighting it. It's to do with what underpins a currency and creates confidence in bonds etc for investors. Oil and gas is long term and the financial sector aren't looking like getting passports for the city
4311 2018-10-11 16:38:48 Or palm oil, o ma burst danu 
My prayers are with him tho 
4312 2018-10-11 16:38:43 there's just still a  strong streak of traditional, mythical focus on healing. techies keep trying to butt in with "we can solve w/ metrics, humans are machine" and their products & services are recognized as snake oil even by capitalism itself (Theranos & 23andMe big examples)
4313 2018-10-11 16:38:41 Always said as a former soldier, killing imbeciles is easy, hurting a dog is impossible. Remind to tell you a story about Kuwait oil fields after Gulf 1.
4314 2018-10-11 16:38:39 Also, there are many oil refinery in the  southern gulf states. I travel there frequently even crossing from Alabama to Mississippi there is significant savings on gasoline. It's not just a blue/red thing. It's also a transportation cost thing.
4315 2018-10-11 16:38:38 $40 for an oil change you got me fucked up.
4316 2018-10-11 16:38:28 Oil. That’s the ticket.

Cash money goldmine, Weezy stay loyal
Boy we getting money like we just found oil
4321 2018-10-11 16:38:15 I think I buy olive oil from your cousin.
4322 2018-10-11 16:38:10 HSAs fed w/some of the oil revenue.
4323 2018-10-11 16:38:07 Yea because remember we didn’t have hurricanes before they discovered oil and began using fossil fuels

4325 2018-10-11 16:38:03 If she don’t go and spend 25$ on a dildo. This is a mess... BABY oil?? As lube? Where the coconut oil at? Sis needs assistance: this is an emergency.
4326 2018-10-11 16:37:49 As I scroll fb, I see people posting about all different kinds of pain...why not try CBD oil??? BEST alternative to RX drugs or suffering with nothing! It helps your whole body at once AND EVERYONE CAN BENEFIT FROM CBD OIL!!!!!!!
4327 2018-10-11 16:37:43 Norway stood up to their oil sector and raised royalties. They called their bluff and prospered. Canada and Alberta did not. Now they are in a real mess.
4328 2018-10-11 16:37:38 As long as they have the oil.
4329 2018-10-11 16:37:27 And they’ll still be without oil.
4330 2018-10-11 16:37:26 ありがとうございまーす！！
4331 2018-10-11 16:37:23 I love your art’s 
can you make a video drawing with acrylic paint ?

4332 2018-10-11 16:37:22 He may well have sneaked in !that would explain the photo of her pooped pants hoping he wasn’t gonna heckle or ask why his monsterous spinning had been dissed. But If his addendum “if we were like Venezuela oil and ..,”  #shit_hit_fan_shit_shit_skirt_bulge_oops_tena
4333 2018-10-11 16:37:20 After his article criticising  Modi Govt folly on Oil pricing this was expected. Lo & behold it's happened, No Surprise. Criticise Govt policy & you will be raided. It's the Surgical strike that is certain.Good luck Mr Behl.

4335 2018-10-11 16:37:05 My makeup was coming out really patchy underneath my eyes this past week and I got so worried. Picked up a face oil from Target and it looks sooo much better already. I love the winter, but my skin hates it  I’m scared lol
4336 2018-10-11 16:37:00 I roasted a butternut squash with some oil and NOTHING else, and holy shit it's so sweet
4337 2018-10-11 16:36:58 "Either oil or your cum~ Your choice" 

//Sure
4338 2018-10-11 16:36:57 Well wasn’t talking about oil industry but I get nothing from defending the oil industry Many ppl in Alberta right now cannot work bc of lack of action on a pipeline that shouldve been built already Face it oil & gas r needed like it or not so why not prosper here in ?

4340 2018-10-11 16:36:55 I love the Terry Pratchett take on every book at the beach turning into those. "An alchemical combination of sun, quartz crystals and coconut oil will somehow metamorphose any improving book into a rather thicker one with a name containing at least one Greek word or letter."
4341 2018-10-11 16:36:55 IMHO should it forecast 1 hike in December and 3 in 2019 without knowing where the economy, jobs, oil, housing...?
4342 2018-10-11 16:36:54 We need a comprehensive approach. Something that will remove carbon from the atmosphere, while also regulating companies from producing carbon, AND changing the cultural perspective like going vegan, avoiding plastic products alongside technology leaning against oil/coal
4343 2018-10-11 16:36:43 I've always been ok with it. Far from ideal but considering what this roster looks like, it may be their best option.
4344 2018-10-11 16:36:43 Phone in an order your snake oil.
4345 2018-10-11 16:36:36 You can honestly use the oil my face produces to fry plantain and still have some left to trade with foreign countries
4346 2018-10-11 16:36:31 People need to be more specific on the term “reformer.” You can make the argument that MbS is trying to reform the Saudi social and economic system by fighting the clerics and diversifying away from oil. But politically, he is anything but a reformer.

4351 2018-10-11 16:36:07 Obama. Blair,probably every US president for decades. Millions have been killed in one war after another, so capitalists can build oil pipelines and plunder other countries' resources. From Vietnam,to Iraq, to Afghanistan.Yemen.Palestine,Libya,Syria... the list goes on...
4352 2018-10-11 16:36:01 24しましたー
4353 2018-10-11 16:35:56 I wish! Oil is great!
4354 2018-10-11 16:35:51 This was the case in Texas during the shale oil boom. A lot of folk got rich from leases on their land.
4355 2018-10-11 16:35:36 A couple drops of witch hazel in water  maybe with some tea tree oil too
4356 2018-10-11 16:35:33 Cannabis cures cancer using Rick Simpson oil and CBD
4357 2018-10-11 16:35:30 Oh, I agree, if almost any other Country in the world did that.... the quicker we can get off oil the better, that's why they get away with it
4358 2018-10-11 16:35:26 coconut oil actually suffocates hair follicles, i read that off some paul mitchell article lol
4359 2018-10-11 16:35:26 It's not the Fed's fault the economy is going down Its Trump's polices, getting out of the tpp.Taking4 million barrels of Iranian oil off the market. Trade war with China, No healthcare policy, etc,etc.etc...it's Trumps economy NOW!!

4365 2018-10-11 16:35:10 I have the most extra grandparents. They LOVE the AU popcorn at the games and so they asked what kind of popcorn, oil, and salt they use. THEY WENT TO THE STORE AND BOUGHT EXACTLY WHAT AU USES. I’ve know about it since before my grandpa passed away but I still think it’s funny
4366 2018-10-11 16:35:04 Strawberry Mask: 
• 3-4 fresh strawberries
• 1 tablespoon of coconut oil
• 1 tablespoon of honey-almond

Directions: blend all ingredients together until smooth consistency. Apply to scalp from roots to tips of your hair. Rinse with cold water after 20 minutes.

4368 2018-10-11 16:34:52 what’s ya’ll fav oil to oil pull with?
4369 2018-10-11 16:34:46 I don't think it would hurt England that much
 Saving 10bn a year would help them. Trade barriers and oil and gas would hurt them a bit.
4370 2018-10-11 16:34:41 This is a practice of all oil companies  carried out in lease area under corporate social responsibilities. We are expecting some solid developmental works from PTI govt in Distt Karak. Khushal Khan Khattak uni has no land and building which needs ur special attention.

4377 2018-10-11 16:33:54 Todo mundo deveria ter a oportunidade de ouvir o álbum coconut oil da LIZZO a autoestima aumenta em 357% só com scuse me
4378 2018-10-11 16:33:21 It isn't surprising that Bishop Oyedepo isn't seeing "islamization" agenda in Atiku's presidency. Some probabilities can be overlooked in view of possible oil block acquisition. Tithe offerings are dwindling

4380 2018-10-11 16:33:13 In other words... No, he didn't read it. He won't read it. It's likely already in the trash. If he did do anything in response, he'd lose his kickbacks from the oil and coal industries.
4381 2018-10-11 16:33:13 I guess if it makes you feel like you’re fighting “the man” then have fun with that. By the way you both realize northern Colorado has oil gas, solar, and turbine going for them correct? Manufacturing and utilizing all 3
4382 2018-10-11 16:32:58 My son has a mosquito bite so he brought me the witch hazel and my tea tree blended oil. He knows the deal

4388 2018-10-11 16:32:31 Yeah, I can't take Ibuprofen plays my hiatus hernia up & gives me really bad acid reflux. I know there were some blogger ops for trying CBD Oil floating around recently, so that might be worth looking out for. :)
4389 2018-10-11 16:32:29 Is your vehicle ready for winter? 
1) Change oil
2) Maintain battery
3) Ensure visibility

5) Check antifreeze
6) Clean fuel injector
7) Inspect radiator cap & thermostat

4390 2018-10-11 16:32:27 Anybody has historical data on real interest rate differential with US and foreign fund flows? Other than oil price, the only other scare talked about is fund outflow on rising rates in US. In boom times of 2005/6, US rates were about 4.25 & still we had good inflows.
4391 2018-10-11 16:32:27 I’ve had the cbd oil made me feel to relaxed before so gonna try the vape scouse see how it goes fucking sleeps a nightmare in training bodies to pumped to sleep so hopefully helps with that

4393 2018-10-11 16:32:19 Since I started supplementing I feel like I have much more energy:
Vitamin D3, High EPA and DHA cod liver oil, CBD oil, Super Greens tablets, BCAA's, Magnesium + 1 drop of Iodine every 2 days.  Most importantly, eating clean and training again.
4394 2018-10-11 16:32:18 We're now seeing a concerted effort to destroy our economy by attacking the Petro dollar in the UN climate report and now bad blood with Saudi Arabia.
We get no oil from them. They regulate our $by keeping prices at set level.
4395 2018-10-11 16:31:48 Just because you check the oil in your car doesn’t make you a mechanic...just because you lift weights doesn’t mean you can call yourself a strength coach and train athletes...
4396 2018-10-11 16:31:46 Thanks for speaking ! Missing action !

4400 2018-10-11 16:31:19 I think the Saudis need oil revenue and that without it, their support will collapse quickly. Will iberal democracy fill the void?  Unlikely.  Will the next regime behead housekeepers?  Also unlikely, but who knows?  Not advocating for regime change, just clean hands.
4401 2018-10-11 16:31:19 He gives rats ass to climate change. Infact he is the complete opposite, as soon as he got sworn , he put in energy dominance program, rt now US is largest oil producer in the world, he is making America oil independent and changing geo politics forever.
4402 2018-10-11 16:31:03 Thanks for the article. Not to be argumentative but to wait until Aug 2018 to voice objections hardly seems like warning & this -> "dispute will not affect oil exports to Canada. Khalid Al-Falih cited a long-standing policy that oil trade isn't affected by  political concerns."
4403 2018-10-11 16:30:59 I agree as every government is looking at the money / business and oil of Saudi Arabia! They have impunity & guess what! Saudi government knows it & knows that money controls everything !
4404 2018-10-11 16:30:51 Embrace the oil sis

4415 2018-10-11 16:29:58 Interesting that only foreign oil turns into CO2 when you burn it.
4416 2018-10-11 16:29:52 You're hilarious and I love you 

P.S. I still get the occasional pimple and I'm decades older than you. Console yourself with this: women with a little more oil in their skin age WAY better than their dry-skinned sisters. #fact
4417 2018-10-11 16:29:50 the only reason you would cancel this project is if Trump, Harper or oil told you too

4419 2018-10-11 16:29:31 omg, I dropped an open jar once. Oil EVERYwhere.

Jus asking
4421 2018-10-11 16:29:19 I think that you seem pragmatic enough to realise that we should not just clean break. For example the loss of the underpinning influence of oil and gas would hurt sterling in a major way. That has to be done in a controlled fashion that does not result in hardship for either.
4422 2018-10-11 16:29:19 I’ve been suggesting that since last year. Let McDavid carry a line and help Leon by giving him talent not a rookie like Yamamoto who shouldn’t be in the NHL
4423 2018-10-11 16:29:11 Good morning! Eating flax seed and fish oil can also aid with eye prallums!!! Good day!!!
4424 2018-10-11 16:29:10 Hot tip: order some chili powder from San Francisco Spice Company and just add it to anything. It tastes amazing, especially in soups. Also: bake sweet potato cubes in avocado oil & chili powder, cook black beans in pan with onions/garlic. Serve both in tacos with fixin's.
4425 2018-10-11 16:29:04 I use Australis, the marula oil one (it’s from Superdrug) but they have a few diff ones depending on your undertones etc!! 10/10 would recommend x

4427 2018-10-11 16:29:02 Emotional drivel with no basis in reality. What does Prop 1 even have to do with the Exxon Valdez oil spill in the PWS? That was in the ocean while Prop 1 deals with fresh water bodies. Also, what gaps do you see in the current system? It’s the most strict in the entire US.
4428 2018-10-11 16:29:02 Na people when get oil block or their person get oil block.  Even most of those people all their family Dey outside na only the ones when dey run d business Dey Naija.
4429 2018-10-11 16:28:43 You think that if they can’t sell oil, they’ll turn to liberal democracy?
4430 2018-10-11 16:28:41 Remind me again, where does the money come from for an oil fund?
4431 2018-10-11 16:28:40 Would you believe it...my s*pe*r*m production has ceased production.... The banner at the gate says... WHY PRODUCE OIL IF EVERYONE IS USING ELECTRICAL CARS....!!!GO FIGURE
4432 2018-10-11 16:28:36 #Oil prices slumped to more than two-week lows on Thursday as global stock markets fell, with investor sentiment made more bearish by U.S. government data that showed domestic crude inventories rose more than expected last week.
4433 2018-10-11 16:28:32 So Judge who imposed punitive punishment on peaceful fracing protesters, whose sister is managing director of family business, which is in oil & gas industry & is fracking lobbyist & her husband is Chief Constable... 3rd world tin-pot oilocracy.  Meanwhile the planet burns!  
4434 2018-10-11 16:28:30 I didn't see this until today. But please don't bring up obstruction and demonizing the other side ever again. Thanks

4437 2018-10-11 16:27:54 #ladybirdinvasion  cont:..be aware of your animals also. I’ve read a few articles were a dog was curious of the Ladybugs & hundreds were found inside the roof of the dogs mouthLadybugs hate Citronella & a spray combined of vegetable oil & mild liquid soap. 
4438 2018-10-11 16:27:54 Bones don’t make oil
4439 2018-10-11 16:27:52 Apparently the parties collecting data and charting inflation for the FRB are a bit off. Delta Airlines cited over 30% increase in fuel costs. It is even worse for the consumer. Speculators and traders betting on $100 oil. Russia and other nations love it. This is the inflation.
4440 2018-10-11 16:27:46 #bcpoli @cknw @bc1 @jonmccomb980 We supply Canadian Oil & Canadian Natural Gas to Washington Refineries -- then they sell gas back to us at inflated Prices -- we are getting scammed 2) Mr Gas Buddy & Roy Green said Trudeau is unstable & needs Mental Help = gas buddy Plays Poli
4441 2018-10-11 16:27:44 Kollar du i listan så är huvudsyftet (=nästan alla) ”Enhanced oil recovery”, dvs för att få ihop ekonomin krävs att ”CCS” används för att skapa mer CO2. Fin green wash på den.

Sen tillkommer att odla skog i extrem skala, annars blir det inte negativt
4442 2018-10-11 16:27:44 Threatening Saudi isn’t going encourage more oil production. Is it?
4443 2018-10-11 16:27:40 Обожаю вот этих вот «шарящих» долбоебов, откуда блядь все должны знать чувака, у которого и ляма просмотров нет на клипах.
4444 2018-10-11 16:27:31 Keep it tidy (shave where you want it clean) get beard oil. A beard comb and scissors. Condition it. Most importantly be patient
4445 2018-10-11 16:26:58 vitamin c oil is also really good for hydrating and evening skin tones! and tea tree oil dried out any pimples!!
4446 2018-10-11 16:26:57 คุณมีรสนิยมชอบชายแก่อายุคราวพ่อเหรอครับ
4447 2018-10-11 16:26:56 “In September 1938, the Japanese air attaché informed Minister Azćarate that Japan would be willing to sell airplanes to Mexico. The Minister of War ordered him to obtain a catalogue and prices and wait for further details.” 

In other words, planes in exchange for oil.
4448 2018-10-11 16:26:54 There's also a substantial arts. Able to afford easels, oil paints, and canvases for EVERY STUDENT on a daily basis. The student theater is putting on its 17th production of Romeo & Juliet in a row, and the director is the only old person in the entire school
4449 2018-10-11 16:26:53 Syed's next book title and snake oil flavour! The enthused athlete!
4450 2018-10-11 16:26:49 Por favooor es tipo robó a 2 manos trayendo barcos de fuel oil y gas y pagando precios exhorbitantes. Claro, como la factura via subsidio les costaba $30 a los porteños, no importaba...
4451 2018-10-11 16:26:33 US government uses US Military to back up federal reserve notes.
We depend on ritual human sacrifices - like school buses of children, in Yemen - to ensure the value of our currency.
People in the world know they will die if they don't buy oil with our currency.
4452 2018-10-11 16:26:10 On the other hand the masters your serving have been running drugs for weapons ratlines for decades, arming terrorists all over the Middle East and Africa to destabilize and overthrow regions so they can rape them of oil and minerals ect, while we get flooded with opiates
4453 2018-10-11 16:26:03 パンダロコ?
4454 2018-10-11 16:26:03 Logistics.
Is Brent heavier than US crude? [there's a whole range/continuum]

If you have oil you can't export [logistics] or store and production is continuous then you sell it at a "discount"
Think of maize in RV that can't be "exported" to Nairobi coz of poor roads.
4455 2018-10-11 16:25:56 Really great. And a lesson in self-control. Had to fight the urge to touch everything or plop my hand in the oil.
4456 2018-10-11 16:25:54 So you are against getting oil out of the bay. Glad to know you will be parking your ride
4457 2018-10-11 16:25:52 Fine. Strategize. But know your enemy. Oil company CEOs are not just lucky; they are very good at what they do. You cannot fight them head to head. You have to come at them sideways; with an attack on their business privilege.
4458 2018-10-11 16:25:48 Kleveru jojoba oil sihhhhh

4460 2018-10-11 16:25:41 Black coworker saw me put oil and butter into my coffee and thought I was fucking with him. He couldn’t fathom. Wish I could have recorded his reaction, was truly priceless
4461 2018-10-11 16:25:39 Hello, one easy way to check if a product contains sustainable palm oil is to look for the RSPO trademark on pack. Another way you can make a difference is by asking companies who are not using #sustainable #palmoil to become members of #RSPO.
4462 2018-10-11 16:25:38 I don’t think it’s weird. It’s normal cuz you love her
4463 2018-10-11 16:25:30 pro life people watched a video of someone mutilating a hamburger patty and saying it was a fetus one time in 2008 and then used it as an excuse to vote for people who want to dump oil into all of our drinking water for the rest of their lives
4464 2018-10-11 16:25:30 But there won't be because. Oil.
4465 2018-10-11 16:25:24 Coconut oil. It dried my lips out for like 2 days

4469 2018-10-11 16:24:59 That's crazy! Ours was very similar. Not ideal.

When will we figure out that we don't need retreats; we need time to go to the bank and see the dentist and get our oil changed?
4470 2018-10-11 16:24:56 mr Trump is most untrustworthy man. 10x more then kanjarwal-of-delhi.
4471 2018-10-11 16:24:52 You have a point, but isn't it the issue more complicated? Yes, Bush sent more than 5000 innocent young Americans in army uniform n over 100000 Iraqis to premature death for oil and to avenge his dad. The region is hell ever since. But the Bushes do not espouse Fascist ideas. 1/
4472 2018-10-11 16:24:44 GOOD MORNING SEATTLE!!! Come get delicious bud and SMOKIN' DEALS! Eighths starting at $10! Grams of oil also starting at $10
4473 2018-10-11 16:24:41 Wouldn’t be a day off without checking up on adult responsibilities like oil changes, but at least I got to check up with a teacher friend! @HannahDeel
4474 2018-10-11 16:24:41 Fiat Money is made by humans, for humans. Humans control it and humans can destroy it. -> the price is dropping.

Gold, oil, cryptocurrencys,... are made by something bigger than human. Humans can't control it. Humans can't destroy it. -> the price is raising continuously.

4475 2018-10-11 16:24:39 Tomorrow after my class and hopefully they’ll be done changing my oil
4476 2018-10-11 16:24:38 I wonder what Jerryatric and the Pinheads in Sacramento would say if China started horizontal drilling to tap Kalifornia's oil.

4486 2018-10-11 16:24:05 Our politicians and their wealthy donor base has ignored all the human rights abuses and ties to 9/11 terrorists in exchange for foreign oil and $$. We’re suddenly to believe they care now and expect Trump to do something? Yeah right.
4487 2018-10-11 16:24:00 How old were you when you discovered that *Oando* was an acronym for O and O (Ocean and Oil)? 

Me: Today years old. 
4488 2018-10-11 16:23:54 I don’t care who you host-you are weak because you can’t take criticism and kill your critics. We could easily go full alternative fuel and make your oil worthless. We can deal with you without firing a single shot.Fools.

4492 2018-10-11 16:23:32 Cannabis may well be the most useful plant on Earth. Oil, fuel, medicine, fabric all vilified by special interests, big lumber and big pharma. Agree 100%
4493 2018-10-11 16:23:25 If you change the USD/LKR rate to 169.9 and price of oil to $83.3. Leaving everything constant the LKR price is 155.02. Now I am off by 2 cents and it's wrecking my head

4501 2018-10-11 16:22:51 Carrick can only have one form of carbamazepine as not all epilepsy medication treats all kinds of fits, there is a risk his body can used to it and the effects stop... cannabis oil is a life line, it’s also not bright orange as the carbamazepine is.. also cheaper
4502 2018-10-11 16:22:48 Cleaning my car, changing my oil, and fixing this damn regulator today
4503 2018-10-11 16:22:44 Only like 0.2% of oil comes from dinosaurs, rest is plants.
4504 2018-10-11 16:22:36 I tried CBD oil from Holland & Barrett fur my hyperthyroid/bipolar. Not sure it did anything for me but it was only 5% strength. Not much help, sorry x
4505 2018-10-11 16:22:26 My whole turbo blew up at the dealership today... after they changed out all the seals for the oil and changed the cooling system...
4506 2018-10-11 16:22:25 Think he should remember that the Great Depression happened when Republicans controlled all 3 branches of government. Think he would make mistake firing Fed chairman. According to reports the Stock Market reacting to oil prices also. Trump's Policies causing the sell off.

4509 2018-10-11 16:21:56 And a buttload of Russian donated money from the NRA, and the oil and gas lobby. He is a liar. Claiming to be from Colorado. And claiming to value life over money. He is already bought and paid for.
4510 2018-10-11 16:21:42 Also, try slowly browning the mushrooms and onions in a little oil before you add any water--and when you do add water, do it slowly and make sure you dissolve all the brown goodness (the fond) on the bottom of the pot.

4514 2018-10-11 16:21:35 Heavy crude from oil sands that is put through and upgrader. Upgrades the bitumous crude to medium low sulphur crude

4516 2018-10-11 16:21:28 love your texas oil tycoon look yue #BANANAFISH
4517 2018-10-11 16:21:25 Generally it’s medium sweet crude that is produced by upgrading oil sands heavy sour bitumen. It’s slightly less than half of Canadian oil sands output.
4518 2018-10-11 16:21:22 These people are the lobby. They are getting paid either for these tweets or because they have a crap job with the crooked oil industry and care more about thier paychecks than the lives of their children.

4520 2018-10-11 16:21:20 I tried CBD Oil Gel Capsules. I have Fibro, Degenerative Disc Disease, PCOS, Osteoarthritis & more. I found they helped a little but not massively given how much they cost. Maybe because I have so many conditions they weren't as effective.
4521 2018-10-11 16:21:20 It’s time to reseason my cast iron so the condo smells of smokey oil.
4522 2018-10-11 16:21:20 Today oil is cooling should ONGC, HPCL  rise. Sir please needs your guidance.
4523 2018-10-11 16:21:16 In the last decade, the US has become a net oil exporter for the first time, dt fracking. Nowadays things are more about domestic refiners than the ports.

4533 2018-10-11 16:20:43 There’s already CBD oil that you can buy from vape shops in the UK, the cheapest I’ve seen some for is £10.
4534 2018-10-11 16:20:37 People complain that worship songs use water and fire metaphors too much, but one of the Psalms uses oil in Aaron's beard as a metaphor. Maybe water and fire are just fine. Just saying.

4536 2018-10-11 16:20:25 If it doesn't work, that can come out without a scientific study

If a parent tries a $12 bottle of Cbd oil on their seizuiring kid & it calms their seizures, why would they wait 10 years before it's extensively studied and 10 more years before it's 'common medical knowledge'
4537 2018-10-11 16:20:09 It's a nasty concoction of oil and chemicals.

4549 2018-10-11 16:18:52 I think we are heading into deflationary bust. Stocks lower, bonds rally hard, oil tanks harder before we see inflation. Zn is going to squeeze the shit out of those shorts apart!!! Bonds in general should see a rally from here!!
4550 2018-10-11 16:18:50 Will ask those that received messages from you @GutuObert purporting that our economy is not collapsing to come collect cooking oil from you. In your statements you guaranteed its existence knowing quite well otherwise. So this could be your creation
4551 2018-10-11 16:18:40 #US stocks fell for a 6th day, extending the longest losing streak of Donald #Trump’s presidency, as energy shares plunged and a rally in tech failed to lift the broader market! The $USD fell with #oil, #Treasuries rose and #gold posted its biggest gain since May 2017!
4552 2018-10-11 16:18:21 All of these are better for the environment and people’s safety compared to oil and gas huh?

4563 2018-10-11 16:17:44 Went in for a free oil change, ended up spending $100.

4571 2018-10-11 16:17:01 Crude oil peaked for an important intra-year trend. Will take a new high for 2018 to say otherwise. A related low is due in a few weeks. May temper fund buyers in commodities.

It's like a gamble, 50/50, nowdays people is goin/opt for better cleaner energy resources plus it's use too much land. n If I could choose btwn cooking oil I'll choose peanuts oil.
4575 2018-10-11 16:16:41 American lives are worth less than oil money to President Mushbrains.
4576 2018-10-11 16:16:29 Solar and wind could easily replace oil and gas. We could do that shit tomorrow. The only reason it hasn’t happened yet is because of he oil and gas lobby and dumb fucks like you.
4577 2018-10-11 16:16:21 can i DIY oil change??? lmao
4578 2018-10-11 16:16:18 On parle du peak oil depuis les 1950s et surtout depuis 1972 et le rapport Meadows - jamais démenti dans ses prévisions, à quelques détails près. L'article explique que ton graphique (qui date de la même année) est bidonné afin d'exagérer les ressources disponibles.
4579 2018-10-11 16:16:10 Brent crude hit due to crude oil inventories datafrom $82 to  $80.69
4580 2018-10-11 16:16:08 Long story.  Tell her I now pay excess for things as basic as red oil and g. Oil.  Don't get me started on price of fuel and cost of Tfare and the valueless state of naira.
4581 2018-10-11 16:16:07 $CEI is Overshorted , Drilling results and Earnings soon .   Oil RSI is cooling .. getting ready for a spike =   Very high squeeze potential .

4584 2018-10-11 16:16:00 Then what is the use of finance and oil ministry if everything is due to foreign countries?
4585 2018-10-11 16:16:00 Don’t ambassadors get discount codes to dish out? One chap can offer you a great deal on snake oil insoles 
4586 2018-10-11 16:15:59 Planning to get some luminous oil paints and turn that little shit into a Picasso.
4587 2018-10-11 16:15:59 Saudis  w/their oil prices.I  recall  when  that  deal w as  struck  how  they hated  Obama  for it  as  it  brought  down their  oil  prices  to  1970's level..they w ere moaning like  crazy  they'll be  poor. ENTER  TRUMPO..  they've been  in cahoots. George  Nader their  fixer
4588 2018-10-11 16:15:53 Imagine the economic impact of that diverse and broad range of infrastructure being built instead of a few wealthy oil companies exploiting Americans for the profits of a few shareholders.
4589 2018-10-11 16:15:43 Everyone wants to be 'Oily' but no one takes time to put the Oil in a Jar and make it Accessible!!!!! What's in the Jar is what will sustain you financially!!!!

4591 2018-10-11 16:15:27 @CatherinePaiz  do Squats , and rub your belly to stimulate contractions . Use virgin olive oil and massage around your “V” it will really stimulates the contractions and birth . Best is to rub the belly  and sit in the warm water tub .
4592 2018-10-11 16:15:24 He told me last time to “get an oil man (oil field)” “they have lots of money” LOL been there done that buddy. They have lots of issues too
4593 2018-10-11 16:15:19 Just watched it. All I learned is how your greedy Uni stole half of your 1.1 million, u found nothing scientifically n your fellow mate went to oil company who pay him more!  u just proved me right. I am not attacking decent scientist at all I am only saying there are crooks
4594 2018-10-11 16:15:15 Sierra Club: A company called SAExploration wants to start seismic oil testing in the Arctic Refuge this winter.
4595 2018-10-11 16:15:15 You can buy olive oil instead 
4596 2018-10-11 16:15:09 Baking soda & Lemon face mask:

- Combine 2 TBS of baking soda & 1 TBS of lemon juice.
- Mix well and apply to face no longer than 15 min. 
- Rinse w/ cool water & apply oil free moisturizer! 
- Use only ONCE a week! -
4597 2018-10-11 16:15:09 I assume all you AK residents indicating you will vote 'Yes' because.. 'greedy oil companies' either 1)don't apply for a divided 2)don't work in a public sector job (all state funds are derived from oil) 3)don't plan on living out your days in this State. Don't lock up AK Vote NO
4598 2018-10-11 16:15:02 Basically no.  Pacific coast blocked by 'green' BC.  Pipelines held up endlessly. Read up on Kinder Morgan's travails - Ottawa actually bought a project from them.  Oil-by-rail all the way across Canada to the Maritimes or St. Lawrence?  Dubious...
4599 2018-10-11 16:14:50 Cold brew + Peppermint CBD Oil + MCT Oil.
4600 2018-10-11 16:14:49 Sorry I deleted that last tweet, I miss typed. I use acrylic because it dries really quickly, they can have the same depth as oil and the same transparency as water colours.
4601 2018-10-11 16:14:45 The oil & coal industries have successfully #bamboozled the American public. They prize an #ignorant & ill informed #populous. And abhor #democracy, & want the market to #decide everything. They see #societal forces as a hindrance, & that property is more vital than #WeThePeople.
4602 2018-10-11 16:14:45 There is no room in the West for Islamic law it's like oil and water just look at the other countries how they've taken over and behead you if you don't follow crime follow these people around the world

4607 2018-10-11 16:14:28 Oil field workers need more recognition 
4608 2018-10-11 16:14:19 Hence, their mistake. If a good thing is happening, you take credit for not stopping it. Looking at soaring oil and gas supply Team Obama got out of way, ensured a future for the NG bonanza, for example, w/their greenlighting of LNG exports. Plus, got domestic wind+solar rolling.
4609 2018-10-11 16:14:07 i make turmeric tea with lemon, honey, & a dash of pepper, but i need to get back to taking vitamins. currently i just take black seed oil in capsules, but i’m supposed to be taking b-12 and vitamin d. i wanna try taking herbs as well at some point lol

4615 2018-10-11 16:13:38 Infact Norway a country of 5 million same as Scotland are in profit over their oil where as the UK is trillions is debt that Paul is years and years of UK governments fucking screwing about with money and hiding money in off shore accounts
4616 2018-10-11 16:13:37 Twitter! Halp! I have polished concrete floors in most of my apartment. Lately they've been VERY slippery, i actually hurt my ankle slipping a few weeks ago. I thought it was oil residue from oil shows & a good mopping would help but it made it worse.

- Rinse w/ warm water & apply an oil free moisturizer after.

4632 2018-10-11 16:12:49 @mymonq you guys should totally sell reusable diffusers. So I can just buy a new thing of oil every now and then rather than having to toss an entire diffuser every month
4633 2018-10-11 16:12:42 Must be the multinational oil & gas companies he means, right? Or are there shadowy solar players roaming the earth, like those blowhard wind farmers.
4634 2018-10-11 16:12:34 yo.. take all this energy & put it towards big oil companies. they’re the ones literally fucking us. vote for people that believe in climate change, want to implement sustainable & clean practices, and have your best interests in mind.. (it ain’t Donald nor Hillary)
4635 2018-10-11 16:12:24 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

4639 2018-10-11 16:12:04 Wish I could have a weekend where friends traded practical life skills. Like...teach me how to change my oil and I'll teach you how to hem a pair of pants or cook a good chicken.
4640 2018-10-11 16:11:49 I just spilled coconut oil on my bathroom floor.  All that precious goodness wasted...lol

as modi is unable to run this country
You can see the rates of crude oil
INR value became so weak that it's become history
4644 2018-10-11 16:11:41 How much will it cost for an oil change?
4645 2018-10-11 16:11:39 I just noticed a giant oil stain on my favorite sweater I’m wearing today and I’m about ready to go home
4646 2018-10-11 16:11:39 Nope. He's so in bed with them he's covered in fleas.
 Why don't we quit importing their oil and quit exporting ours?
4647 2018-10-11 16:11:32 1) steak cookin

5) anything with sesame oil while its cookin
4648 2018-10-11 16:11:31 Trump's report admits reality of temp rise. @SethMacFarlane's denial is bogus. Trump EPA realistic - can't stop w/lifestyle or industrial changes, so why bother. Only fusion power, desert expansion & bury carbon solids. Algae oil & bio-material production can't scale w/o fusion.

4653 2018-10-11 16:11:12 Saudia is investing in CPEC for oil refinery, this will lower oil prices I guess.
Russia is supplying gas, also will construct gas storage tanks.
4654 2018-10-11 16:11:08 I hate going for an oil change. They try to get you to do all this extra stuff and I don't know if I actually need it or they're just saying I do. Hahahaha

4667 2018-10-11 16:09:47 What I’m saying is I don’t think it’s particularly just a Dem or Republican problem, I can give you anecdotal evidence where both parties have success and failure. California the worlds sixth largest economy and prosperous. Texas big oil industry very prosperous there. It’s about
4668 2018-10-11 16:09:44 pasta, mozzarella, prosciutto, soft-boiled eggs, cherry tomatoes, rocket, some nice olive oil, a bit of argan oil, whatever herbs I fancy that day

4670 2018-10-11 16:09:26 3 hikes priced in the next year for the BOC is plain wrong, Western Select(oil sands crude) is trading at $19 a barrel vs. WTI at 72, housing market slowing substantially, provincial infighting, consumer deleveraging...
4671 2018-10-11 16:09:24 I'm not buying what these snake oil salesmen are selling. But they will have a bunch of brainless people who can't think for themselves believing this BS.
4672 2018-10-11 16:09:13 Yeah, all those truckers, bikers, miners, loggers, construction workers, police officers, military, oil riggers, fishermen etc, bunch of wimps. Good thing you're around to tell us about millions of peoples masculinity, to make yours seem so courageous. Keep guessing.

The problem with using RSO You never know what solvent was used.
Hexane, Namptha, Acetone all have carcinogenic compounds.
Make the oil yourself or don’t use RSO.
4680 2018-10-11 16:08:27 3 hari gak lah tak sentuh web kat office minggu ni, maklum lah kerja sv n staff banyak. Check mapping oil & gas lah, edit power point lah.

Who would have thunk it.
4686 2018-10-11 16:07:53 So what tech would that be? You have done nothing but pissy foot around what I’m asking. You say there is technology and renewables that can be used to replace oil and gas. I’m waiting to hear what those are.
4687 2018-10-11 16:07:53 I did! Her method didn’t help me when I tried it a couple of years ago. But the CBD oil I tried helped within minutes.

4690 2018-10-11 16:07:34 Voters in blue states are willing to pay taxes for services, rather than fight tooth and nail to uphold the GOP’s anti-tax shibboleth ... plus blue states usually have more oil and refineries.
4691 2018-10-11 16:07:29 At confirmations, the bishop will use lemon juice and bread to clean the chrism (oil) from his hands when he's done anointing.
4692 2018-10-11 16:07:26 Anyone know a decent place where I can get my oil changed for a good price

4697 2018-10-11 16:07:13 Btw coconut oil will help hydrate the burn and it shouldn't sting when you apply it. Also if you have any mustard type stuff with vinegar it will hurt when you put it on but it will take the sting out of it.
4698 2018-10-11 16:07:06 พรีมอยากกินนนน
4699 2018-10-11 16:07:00 You’re right uno, lemme heat up the oil
4700 2018-10-11 16:06:59 I think that the conspiracy to kill a Saudi activist is either Israel or the British, the media are well-coordinated, and Israel and the British manage them.Their goal is to break the relations between the US and Saudi Arabia in order to export Iranian oil. Clearly this is a game
4701 2018-10-11 16:06:55 "To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes,the oil of joy for mourning,the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness;that they might be called trees of righteousness,the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified."Isaiah 61:3

4704 2018-10-11 16:06:47 I honestly wouldn't trust a guy to take his pill. My husband takes Fish oil to help his memory and he forgets to take it . My point is that Women's Rights are being violated. The Republicans are trying to make abortion illegal and birth control hard to get.
4705 2018-10-11 16:06:44 ........................
4706 2018-10-11 16:06:41 That is shitty. Hopefully it will be a short stoppage. 

Also part of the reason I got out of the mining, exploration and oil business. The ups and downs got too crazy. The thing is, it will turn around. It always does. 

Hope you guys are ok.

4708 2018-10-11 16:06:34 Amen! This person gets it. And how do they get the opium to make said pain meds you ask? Well, our friends with the poppy fields over in the middle East! Oil and poppies, people...that's what keeps the war going in the middle East. Gotta protect our assets.

4710 2018-10-11 16:06:21 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

Blah blah blah. #IdiotsInCharge

4714 2018-10-11 16:06:09 A good way to cripple the international power and influence of the Saudis - specifically the corrupt Saudi royal family - is to make them irrelevant.  The way to do that is to work aggressively and systematically to eliminate the world's reliance on oil.
4715 2018-10-11 16:06:05 I feel like I’ve spent a long time trying to get ‘capitalists’ to grasp the degree to which their choices hinge on government subsidy; like, would you want an explorer if oil werent massively subsidized, and SUVs exempt from the gas guzzler tax? Prob not.

4755 2018-10-11 16:02:28 It wasn’t an argument it was a question. You brought up renewables and I’m asking what renewables are there that can be built on to replace the oil and gas industry? You can’t build an imaginary infrastructure

I wonder how often we like something so much that we don’t want it to end so we distract ourselves with something else for fear of not having it any more
4810 2018-10-11 15:58:25 If what SEEMS to have happen did happen, it's (IMO) compulsory to create a very strong, and real response.
Arms cut off.
KSA can work it out with the EU nations who need that oil. We do not.
Nor do we have to rationalize an alliance with another 'Somoza'

4827 2018-10-11 15:57:11 I’m reading the communication by OK Zimbabwe. I feel sorry for those who bought cooking oil in panic. You have cash that’s tied up in cooking oil.
4828 2018-10-11 15:57:02 God has blessed us so much as a nation. We have oil, solid minerals, fertile agricultural lands, cotton etc yet we disturb him everyday to help us and not face the actual problem. Countries don’t even have half of what we do and are doing very well.

4847 2018-10-11 15:56:09 At the same time Tanzania MUST severely punish those holding another passport because we are not a DUAL Nationality Country! With our oil and gas reserves, we should NOT allow anybody residing in our country to carry DUAL Nationality!

4855 2018-10-11 15:55:35 ...and I didn’t argue about the oil. Re-read my comment. However, now you come to mention it those little countries are suffering. Greece is constantly being bailed out, Italy and Spain too, which is why they don’t want another runt or bottom feeder in their ranks.

4885 2018-10-11 15:53:40 We differ on HS2's usefulness re climate change (!), but even if I took the most optimistic view I'd argue it doesn't balance impact of fracking, heathrow expansion, 6 lane motorways & refining 380,000 barrels of oil a day in Bahrain - all of which have been supported in last wk.

4905 2018-10-11 15:52:06 It’s that or a bag of cold water I think? I hope you get better! I’m a bit scared of oil, especially when it’s super hot so when cooking I stand like 10 centimeters back _(:3」z)_

4908 2018-10-11 15:51:57 I’m still shocked almost daily finding out more benefits of olive oil.
4909 2018-10-11 15:51:57 Don’t really have one. However, I started trying a mix of coffee, oat milk, olive oil and lemon twice a week. Tadaaa.
4910 2018-10-11 15:51:54 Additionally, I think the media must also continue to hold parties to account in other ways. Because oil and livestock provide so many jobs and pay so many bills, both the government and the media as a whole have been extremely light on their criticism of the climate policy. 7/

I was given a drs name to get oil, but it's way to expensive to see him. So was looking into gummies.
4918 2018-10-11 15:50:50 this girl suggested vitamin E oil to me. i’ve been using it on my face after every wash. it’s doing wonders for me at the moment.
4919 2018-10-11 15:50:42 We will spend a trillion dollars this year exporting death for oil.  Meanwhile 30,000 Americans will die during that same time due to lack of healthcare.  Every year, 10 times as many victims as 9/11 die here needlessly because a few wealthy groups own your leaders.

4942 2018-10-11 15:49:30 14. Inaction or a continued muted response would better safeguard continued alliance against Iran and terrorist networks, future arms sales, and increased oil production over the next few months.

4948 2018-10-11 15:49:06 The facts defend a claim the judge is linked to oil and gas. That’s a justified claim. The facts do not defend the implication the judge is corrupt.

They are endlessly curious people and are not generally motivated by immense amounts of money like the one's hired by oil companies and other polluters to provide a counter pseudo-science to that which upward of 95% of actual scientists support.

4961 2018-10-11 15:47:54 you're absolutely right. we can narrow the "We" to Big Oil, Big Auto, Big Utilities and their stakeholders. All of these can be completely removed from society now using existing technologies like what Tesla is doing.
4962 2018-10-11 15:47:44 How was Larry to know that after all the favors he and his party did for the oil industry that gas prices were going to eat away the $1.50 extra a week in take home pay the fabulous tax cuts delivered to the average American worker? Would have paid for a Costco card!
4963 2018-10-11 15:47:41 Chef Skinner cut up some worms, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with sushi.
4964 2018-10-11 15:47:39 This can help some people see why Native American communities are so strongly opposed to oil and gas pipelines through their lands.
4965 2018-10-11 15:47:38 I don’t think so.  Someone else would protect them.  SA has the oil therefore they’re in the driver’s seat.
4966 2018-10-11 15:47:33 please look into how fast fashion is hurting our ecosystem!!! we talk about just about everything else but fail to bring up the fact that in 2016 fast fashion was the 2nd largest contributor to dirtying the planet (first being big oil)

4973 2018-10-11 15:46:29 Postmedia is owned by an American hedge fund, until recently it had the publisher of the National Enquirer on it's board, it has a mandate to support the oil companies and is actively working to introduce US style conservatism to Canada.
4974 2018-10-11 15:46:24 Capitalism needs some checks and balances. Capitalism’s big mistake was getting too greedy. By attempting to lift oil companies above the law, capitalists have made socialism synonymous with democracy. Democracy is not free; we have to fight for it in the ballot box.
4975 2018-10-11 15:46:21 real olive oil is made by tapping an olive tree, and boiling the sap. of course i may not know what i am talking about.

4980 2018-10-11 15:46:02 Why are we paying $3 per gallon for gas. Pure insanity. The Gulf of Mexico is littered with huge oil rigs. Where is it going!
4981 2018-10-11 15:45:59 @chbmeredith To me, as I said in the beginning, it's never too soon for some to panic. Imagine what happens if the Oil loses to Boston tonight. Some will realize the Bruins are good and playing at home. Others will see doom. That's a big part of why sport is so fascinating.

4986 2018-10-11 15:45:35 I'm not planning to attend #code4lib this year, but I wish I were, so I could buy the proposer of "'Blockchain for Libraries' is Snake Oil" a drink.

4988 2018-10-11 15:45:11 I hate getting a oil change cause I hate waiting
4989 2018-10-11 15:45:09 The backfire is going to hilarious.
4990 2018-10-11 15:45:07 Seems to me that the correct statement in the tweet should have been that the oil droplet experiment failed to simulate the QM affects in the double slit experiment.
4991 2018-10-11 15:45:05 no bong rip will ever make me cough as much as my oil pen

4994 2018-10-11 15:44:56 1/ On #ClimateChange . In 2006 or '07 POTUS GWB said at a SOTUS "America is addicted to oil", this is not new, even for a POTUS LBJ said that in 1967 or '68. Well consider, do addicts ever OD and die from their addiction? That is the fundamental problem for serious people.
4995 2018-10-11 15:44:52 I am very nervous, but I took CBD oil, so the feeling literally only lasts for a second. 
4996 2018-10-11 15:44:48 US foreign policy should be more focused towards Latin America. Their issues are interconnected with our issues more so than any Middle Eastern country. We’re now a net exporter of oil and jihadism is a much greater threat to Europe.

5000 2018-10-11 15:44:37 Skate liver oil is actually the best antioxidant and a taking it daily could add years to everyone's life but the government found this out After WW2 and suppressed the information because they didn't want everyone living longer and being healthier
5001 2018-10-11 15:44:28 Looking to try out CBD oil. Have inflammation, anxiety, seizures. Use CBD oil to see results! Visit my website or message me to order some.
5002 2018-10-11 15:44:23 Yes and taking scots out of EU is going to break your rancid union that scots pay 92% of our oil and gas to be in.

5009 2018-10-11 15:43:43 @blumspew ummmm idk maybe stop using so much coal and oil? Duh
5010 2018-10-11 15:43:41 Truth of the matter is no one can achieve this 

Petrol price won't go down until we refine our crude oil in this country, this is why they have refused to allow the refineries work and same goes
5011 2018-10-11 15:43:36 Not sure if this is that crazy but raw coconut oil lol
5012 2018-10-11 15:43:21 @FoxNews @CNN @realDonaldTrump 
Senator Paul, don't do it.
They can turn off oil supply.
They can let all terrorist loose and have a free will!
5013 2018-10-11 15:43:17 Lol.
It's best to add a few drops of lavendar essential oil or even Rosemary. For the scent

But if you don't have any nice smelling essential oils, You can use the Cantu Leave-in and refrigerate of course

5025 2018-10-11 15:42:01 That's very good, but how many around you or at large can do this. These are exceptions. What will you do for petrol, cooking oil, water and air?
5026 2018-10-11 15:41:52 $26 oil? Believe it. The Canadian Crude Crunch Continues: WCS falls to $26.19/bbl- a massive $45.50/bbl discount to WTI. #OOTT #oil

5030 2018-10-11 15:41:39 Yes, I've just conducted interviews for a short piece to be published later next month. The China market is bewilderingly strong, and the implications for oil, and oil imports, are profound.
5031 2018-10-11 15:41:38 The lyft I’m in smells heavily of tea tree oil and I am LIVING FOR IT.
5032 2018-10-11 15:41:30 Our dependency on foreign oil is a farce! We are by far the worlds largest oil producer and unlike oil producing Arab countries where gas prices are next to nothing. America price gouges Americans.#MAGA
5033 2018-10-11 15:41:28 For natgas no one's even looking 4more. US has >140 years.
For oil, if u declare more than 30yrs, uv identified yourself as a takeover target. So everyone tends to have exactly 30years on their official paperwork. The reality is undoubtedly more. The question is how MUCH more?

5035 2018-10-11 15:41:16 Boundary Dam Project in Estevan SK has taken the equivalent of the city of Regina’s automobile emissions for a year out of the atmosphere. And got two birds stoned at once by reinjecting back into heavy oil plays. (Carbon + H2O = carbolic acid). The technology will get cheaper.

5041 2018-10-11 15:40:56 Who is selling  U the Tucanos? for counter insurgency? who is selling you precision weapons coming with it? where is your foreign reserve and  whose currency is it? who determines the price of crude oil and wot currency it is traded?anybody who undermines the influence  of the US
5042 2018-10-11 15:40:55 Wondering how you can make reduction of fuel possible. I reside in an Arab oil producing nation. Since 2016 when they derugulated due to fallen up prices, it's new price regime every month according to int pricing. It's almost 100% increment from then till Oct prices .

5049 2018-10-11 15:40:24 Right, there are a few freak injuries (although bad necks seem to be a trend in Indy at this point). I still wonder about the field at Lucas Oil and the practice facility. You could say the turf caused Wayne's torn ACL to a degree.

5051 2018-10-11 15:40:20 Cooking oil 
5052 2018-10-11 15:40:19 Is it CDB oil? If so it only contains trace elements of THC (0.3%) which is the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis that gets people high.

I give my elderly dog CBD oil. Bought from the shops. All above board and perfectly legal.

5067 2018-10-11 15:39:40 Sure it is. Oil is a fungible commodity, and it doesn't much matter who buys it. Also, if the Saudis weren't producing, oil is more $, no matter where produced or who buys.

We facilitate the buying, that's what matters.  Without us and our hardware, they couldn't do the selling.

5070 2018-10-11 15:39:17 Did you read the article? Nigeria's leading palm oil producers, Okomu and Presco combined, produces 800 tonnes, meanwhile the FMCG demand is 5000 tonnes. 
It is a wakeup call to palm oil producers to produce as much as 6000 tonnes combined. 5 foe FMCG n 1 for other uses.

Scary tho when you find out how many things you can no longer buy because the 'parent' company is Mondolez.  Or Unilever, Nestle or Pepsico.
5076 2018-10-11 15:38:47 Ooo, you have that special oil. I see. I’m basic. Lol
5077 2018-10-11 15:38:45 Seems globalist elites might want to clear out Africa for themselves. What are resources? Uranium, gold, oil, diamonds... farmland...Why are you sending Africans to Europe? Do you tell them it's for a better life and stick them on a rubber dinghy  to fend for themselves?

5081 2018-10-11 15:38:27 I guess you just bought stocks in American oil, and this is your road to cutting off cheap oil from Saudi Arabia.
You have never said anything, about most of the  terrorists in the 9/11 attacks, came from Saudi Arabia.
You keep Quiet on American lives, but your care for them ????

5088 2018-10-11 15:37:35 The fat that keto is actually promoting is healthy fat:  such as olive oil, coconut oil.  Use butter in your vegetables.  Cook your eggs in butter. That sort of thing.  Good luck.
5089 2018-10-11 15:37:35 Less than 50 hours oil changed every other ride got a racing air filter on it only problem is i over tightened the oil drain bolt and stripped it minor fix doesnt leak oil dont have the time for it anymore

5108 2018-10-11 15:36:18 No, but good try. I’m saying the pattern of policy for Saudi Arabia is across multiple administrations so making it about Trump’s business dealings doesn’t hold water. Maybe they can tank our stock market or cut off our oil supply. That might be a better theory.
5109 2018-10-11 15:36:12 My papa checked it and said it was still oil in there but I still need one bc it’s been so long. Lol
5110 2018-10-11 15:35:57 Maybe our oil prices will come down?????? Anyone want to weigh in on this subject?
5111 2018-10-11 15:35:54 If you don’t think further development of oil and gas is an unmitigated risk to our health and safety, you might want to pay closer attention to climate change science. Sad to see DP be another rube for extraction industry.

5122 2018-10-11 15:35:28 Question... Why would a company pay for a report that supports climate change? What benefit do they get out of it? I know what a company against climate change would benefit from creating a counter narrative(i.e. oil,gas,coal). 

What's the gain?
5123 2018-10-11 15:35:23 PADD 2 just saw its lowest refinery utilization number ever reported by @EIAgov at 73.3% of capacity. #oil #oott
5124 2018-10-11 15:35:20 I was so confident oil would see 80 and 90 and energy sector would do great but now I am really second guessing things and getting cold feet from buying more energy names here now.
5125 2018-10-11 15:35:18 pulled up to a valvoline this morning to get my oil changed and the man yelled, “GOT A CUTE LIL FORD COMING IN” and i just felt really seen, ya know?
5126 2018-10-11 15:35:06 One of my friend who is in the industrial oil business has told after watching this video that this is a water soluble cutting oil and can easily identifiable through its smell. So I believe someone has made this video to misguide people, however we need to be watchful
5127 2018-10-11 15:35:05 India ordered 1.2mn ton crude oil from Iran, entire amount for the order will be paid out interms of India Rupee not by US Dollar.

Trump reaction will be 
5128 2018-10-11 15:35:01 Anyone reading latest IPCC report, should be alarmed and start a call to action. It’s not just Oil. It’s our food, health, life expectancy, ever increasing human migrations, wars, pestilence, droughts, floods. Anyone get this? If we did not have technology, I’d say we are f..ked!

5137 2018-10-11 15:34:17 He wasted our 5 precious years. Pakistan was going with economic crisis, china was engaged with Trump. Crude oil was ₹$45 . We had the best 5 yrs but modi govt destroyed the economy with Demonetisation and bailing out NPA of crony capitalist and his friends who donate his party.
5138 2018-10-11 15:34:13 Why set up an oil change appointment if I'm still going to sit here for almost 2 hours
5139 2018-10-11 15:34:12 I thought oil was suppose to go up when the market was going down?
5140 2018-10-11 15:34:11 We will get there, we are very close. We legalized medicinal oil before weed 
5141 2018-10-11 15:33:56 Don’t use hot products on your hair ... that’s what I do, people say coconut oil but I haven’t tried that
5142 2018-10-11 15:33:54 $100 on an oil change & to rotate my tires. Why? 
5143 2018-10-11 15:33:53 Thank you for this. Oil almost filled gap around 70.70. Hopefully oil and overall market is very near bottom.
5144 2018-10-11 15:33:39 OK here, our current governor made a deal with petroleum companies a few years ago, pay less taxes. Then the bottom fell out of the oil industry, even less tax revenue. Funding was cut for education, healthcare, DHS. The solution- tax the people more.

5147 2018-10-11 15:33:27 Okay my sister maybe Bae didn’t explain.... when a car moves it’s not just fuel inopera...u have Tyres which wear out then you have oil which loses viscosity then you have engine parts like filters , and you have shocks that wear out. So those are replaced when servicing car
5148 2018-10-11 15:33:17 Love this stuff so much! I never knew I would like and oil for my oily face, but it really soaks into my skin and doesn't leave an oily feeling at all behind, only a satin smooth finish on my face! Really helped my skin a ton. I definitely need to repurchase sometime!

5156 2018-10-11 15:32:44 Actually yes we do. Other countries such as China help keep our products at market value. Otherwise the USA will keep low balling our goods such as oil. Because we can’t sell much oil globally. The yanks pay us 30$ less per barrel than the true market value.
5157 2018-10-11 15:32:40 We need the pipeline! Keep the economy going by giving Canadian's jobs and keep the oil "Canadian" instead of relying on other countries. Mother nature gave us oil for a reason. Let's be self-sufficient!

5251 2018-10-11 15:25:48 When you find a new restaurant that has Southern fried chicken and chips on the menu, get super excited then think: I'll just check...Fried in the same oil as gluteny things  At least they've said they will change the menu so it doesn't say gluten-free, though #feedthecoeliacs
5252 2018-10-11 15:25:48 Saudi Arabia isn’t the “Muslim Vatican.” They’re the Beverly Hillbillies of the Middle East. Just a bunch of dumb rednecks who found oil in their backyard and now think they’re kings.

5254 2018-10-11 15:25:32 The oil and gas industry has been fighting this one, so that reaffirms my commitment to it!
5255 2018-10-11 15:25:26 Reunited with my calming oil, because I am sooo tired. After defense season ng aking CHE 4 class, it's defense season for my MENG graduate class.

5256 2018-10-11 15:25:25 Ngerasa ga sih to waktu kuliah orang banyak ngelihat dosen sebagai pekerjaan 'alternatif' yang paling gampang diambil? Padahal karir sebagai akademia itu sulit dan menurut gw man-hour nya sebanding sama orang yang (katanya) lembur di McKinsey atau di oil rig.

5265 2018-10-11 15:24:56 Yea, too much oil and sometimes the meat is raw inside. This I experienced yesterday.
5266 2018-10-11 15:24:55 Yeah idk where she got the “animal agriculture is the number 1 contributor to climate change” thing cause it’s definitely oil companies lol like by far it’s oil companies
5267 2018-10-11 15:24:51 provide for those who grieve in Zion-to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes,

5271 2018-10-11 15:24:27 1. Agriculture would probably not be on the subsistence level it currently is if we didn’t have oil. We’d have focused more and innovated more.

5282 2018-10-11 15:23:48 Overall, it’s trash! Marula, rosehip, jojoba oil are better options.
5283 2018-10-11 15:23:48 I think we back Saudi Arabia for oil , we will never not support them while The GOP are in charge . That is where many of the terrorist come from, and we went into IRAQ instead and thousands of innocents died .i don’t really enjoy being American right now
5284 2018-10-11 15:23:44 John also narrowly escapes being boiled in oil by a bishop, so I don't think anyone comes out of his story well.

5295 2018-10-11 15:22:52 The oil money went to fund health and welfare? Ok.
Question I’d be asking is why doesn’t Norway have those issues.
5296 2018-10-11 15:22:49 @hananiahzion I understand that we all receive the anointing when we are saved. But why then did Samuel anoint Saul? And David? 

Why anoint the sick with oil? Does that not equate to a special purpose?
5297 2018-10-11 15:22:46 Does it go deeper, though?

Will sanctions on Saudi Arabia affect oil companies / stocks / profits?

Does Lindsey Graham stand to profit from any of those companies or stocks?

5302 2018-10-11 15:22:21 Please don't be ridiculous and start thinking.  Venezuela is not at all like the UK. Venezuela was totally dependent on oil and has debts denominated in dollars (which the UK doesn't have), it is also being undermined by the Americans and big corporations.

5392 2018-10-11 15:16:22 Getting an oil change and accidently handed the dude my nursing practice needle with my keys so now he thinks Ima druggie  what is my life
5393 2018-10-11 15:16:17 Also, @EPAAWheeler wants to make sure you're aware he & Trump EPA believe it is INAPPROPRIATE to cut mercury, lead, arsenic, benzene & >80 hazardous air pollutants from power plants that burn coal & oil.

He believes cost of running INSTALLED controls is too high for industry.
5394 2018-10-11 15:16:04 The 9/11 hijackers were from SA. So are you saying, they love us now, and are looking out for us by killing journalists? We keep a military presence in SA in exchange for cheap oil. Having infidels permanently in the Muslim holy land, upsets some of them. OBL was one of those....

He dare not... KSA can bring down his economy with 1 million less of oil production.. Let's not forget Jamal is a Saudi citizen after all killed presumably on Turkish land.. Now ISIS sponsor Erdoğan has alot to say if u ask me
5399 2018-10-11 15:15:35 I need new tires, a windshield, and now an oil change 
5400 2018-10-11 15:15:32 Good intentions notwithstanding, it may be that dealing with the world’s plastic waste amounts to putting a large quantity of the oil we’ve extracted back into the ground. We could use some scientific solutions here.

5403 2018-10-11 15:15:25 Giiirl! You should've went to Meineke for an oil change. I used to pay that much for oil changes and ever since I found Meineke - I never pay that anymore!

5406 2018-10-11 15:15:21 Could you imagine $100 oil and Canada had a pipeline to access foreign markets? Not only would #alberta be prospering, so would the rest of Canada. Outside of Van & Tor housing markets, what sector is prospering? #Trudeau Nah, lets just sell to the USA, we will do them a favour
5407 2018-10-11 15:15:20 Another question is... how on Earth you had baby oil at home? I’m pretty sure I don’t have one in stock! 
5408 2018-10-11 15:15:10 It’s called the ‘oil curse’ or ‘the paradox of plenty’and has in fact been attributed to reduced economic growth, democracy and development. 

So, YES 
5409 2018-10-11 15:15:10 Energy independence should be a priority for the United States. By expanding our renewable energy resources at home, we will be able to revise our foreign policy to be constructed on better morals.

And then we can vote out politicians who sacrifice ethics for oil.

5415 2018-10-11 15:14:50 Some ideas for reducing Oil Import bill are 1. faster implementation of electric vehicles, solar energy, wind energy 2. Substitute diesel locomotives with electric one 3. Time bound switching to Electric City bus and inter state electric buses and tax rebate to offset extra cost

5418 2018-10-11 15:14:42 This is a trend worth monitoring, if Pakistan can replace fuel oil with LNG, most other developing countries can too. For example Bangladesh and SriLanka will follow suit. 

Apart from the obvious pollution reduction, switching to LNG will save Pakistan some money too.

5425 2018-10-11 15:14:18 ...Middle East oil, after which they turned to Africa. Nigeria will learn this again when oil dries up and we have no other source of revenue... It is dangerous to depend on a single source for anything.. Thus,it not a matter of US unreliability but simple common sense

5442 2018-10-11 15:13:18 Liberals have refused to look at the long term history of Earth’s climate. CO2 has ranged from 280 ppm to 8,000 ppm, we’re at 400 ppm now. We’ve also been in a hotter warm period than this one. 
Liberals want to blame CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use to destroy “big oil”.
5443 2018-10-11 15:13:16 I hung out with them & chatted while they fixed it & when it was done & I went to pay they said not to worry about it. I just had to promise to go to them for my oil. It was so kind. The other day I went in for my oil- and they actually remembered me a month later. 2/

5467 2018-10-11 15:12:14 And of course they would NEVER pass on the tax in their charges to customers. So heating oil, petrol, diesel won't go up in price. Which means electricity costs will stay the same. And no extra charges on diesel means no rise in costs for delivery so food prices won't go up.

5511 2018-10-11 15:09:05 One of the least appreciated aspects of this most recent rally in oil prices has been the disproportionately large rise in prices on the back end of the curve. While not at contago yet, it's a more fundamentally positive environment in which to dedicate longer-term resources.
5512 2018-10-11 15:09:03 Oh that's right all the campaign money from Daddy's buddies. Bought and sold before you even begin. And don't worry about those oil wells that will free us from being subjugated to terrorist states. They'll be built by real engineers not incompetent career politicians like you.

12% govt gas taxes
8% refineries (summer & winter fuel can’t mix)
8% distribution & marketing
Then the cost of credit card charges at the pump as well.

5542 2018-10-11 15:06:58 *buzzer* Sorry, anti-intellectualism is when people will dismiss academic or scientific findings. In modern US politics, that’s generally because someone with political clout is profiting off something like oil or fracking.
5543 2018-10-11 15:06:54 Fram oil filters used to have an ad saying “you can pay me now...or pay me later”. When the poop is all over your basement you’ll understand.
5544 2018-10-11 15:06:52 The #Oilers problem isnt that they fire coaches. Its that they hire the wrong ones. Kreuger should have never been let go and Nelson should have been the one given the chance. But the Oil are always whale chasing big name coaches with zero ability, like Eakins and McLellan.
5545 2018-10-11 15:06:52 You’re missing my point it doesn’t eliminate those “common accidents” as you put it though. New developments, schools, parks, hospitals what have you will still be built closer and closer to existing oil and gas production.

5547 2018-10-11 15:06:45 It’s a hatred of the Atlantic provinces.  All the oil workers come from there, hence there must be no work there and the ones that don’t come to Alberta are lazy and willingly unemployed.

5635 2018-10-11 15:01:16 By the same logic, it was OK to invade Iraq because they were not selling us their oil
5636 2018-10-11 15:01:16 Alternate fuels is a FANTASY right now, until then we used oil, don't like it, go off the grid.

5638 2018-10-11 15:01:15 Lmaoooo. Reduce oil, reduce maggi, bread and rice are of the devil. Eat more vegetables and fruits. If you can, eat only one low carb meal per day, let your other meals be fruits/veggies. Warm lemon water morning and night
5639 2018-10-11 15:01:13 I am quite convinced that my essential oil diffuser possesses the ability to disrupt, or move independently of, space-time. Allegedly it is supposed to run for 4 hours max. Yet I started it last night around 1:45am and it is STILL exuding a luscious vapor right now.
5640 2018-10-11 15:01:12 It’ll take some time to post it, until then here’s the breakdown in how gas prices are figured out. Btw think of oil as a Hydrocarbon Bison—nothing gets wasted once it is pumped out of the ground. 72% of cost is oil per barrel and exploration, 12% for Gas Taxes...

5708 2018-10-11 14:57:11 That is literally the dumbest video against climate change. Big oil probably backed them to say these things. The periods they talk about were when humans didn’t live on the planet. And of course they started noticing climate hange in the 20s. The industrial revolution spiked co2

5715 2018-10-11 14:56:37 Norway managed pretty well with it’s cumbersome finite resource...in contrast, of course, to the mercenary and short termist strategy from the UK government. My point wasn’t really about oil anyway, only that the fiscal transfer argument isn’t the whole picture.

5753 2018-10-11 14:53:34 At least 15 years ago we needed their oil.  These days not so much.  And while you can argue that oil is an international market and prices will effect the US domestic production, the excess profits would be staying domestic.

5918 2018-10-11 14:42:17 to clarify both of those are still cannabis. i use both oil and herb. oil tends to take longer to take effect but last 4x longer.  herb kicks in immediately. also there are a multitude of ranges of cbd. also hybrids of cbd and thc combined. go to a cannibas doctor and do it right

5951 2018-10-11 14:39:39 Bill Nelson has been leading Florida in protecting Florida's coastline. He has worked with environmental groups on renewable energy & not allowing oil rigs in Gulf of Mexico. I'm sure, beside being a Dem,  that's why the nasty post about his not being helpful.

5954 2018-10-11 14:39:24 You do a good job trying to talk circles around larger issues to avoid the fact that the Dems are as just as corrupt and complicit with corps/banks/oil as the GOP

Who were the swing votes that approved Kavanope?

GOP broke ranks and the Dems couldnt even whip the vote

5956 2018-10-11 14:39:12 What do I want to discuss?
The fact that my entire life, scientists have been telling the ruling class we need to move away from fossil fuels.
We don't need oil. We don't need natural gas. We choose them because it makes certain people rich

5960 2018-10-11 14:39:03 Oil grew Texas into the great state it is now. It successfully navigated this road before, and it will again. Growing pains are to be expected.
5961 2018-10-11 14:38:59 Snake Oil jibberish.
5962 2018-10-11 14:38:55 I’m getting an oil change and the guy goes I’m getting the munchies just by changing your oil 
5963 2018-10-11 14:38:50 many mistake into: 1- there were no Arab in Kirkouk before 1936.
2- Nineveh wasn't part of Iraq officially B4 1926, in this years Oil founded in Kirkuk.
cuz UK wanted to make state for Christian there, it brings Christians from every were to Kurdistan for being UK local soldiers!

5966 2018-10-11 14:38:41 The only Muslims Trump doesn't call radical are the super-rich ones, like the Saudi prince, whom Trump loves for oil & buying arms from us; and who donated $100 million to Ivanka's women's charity and bailed out Jared from a bad NYC R.E. deal to the tune of #1.2 billion.
5967 2018-10-11 14:38:36 They buy lots of arms from US + they funnel money to trump and Jared and others + they have oil = free pass
5968 2018-10-11 14:38:32 In term of reducing calorie from oil, yes
5969 2018-10-11 14:38:31 I got prescription meds too and something I recently found out is if you get pure peppermint oil and rub a small dog on your temples and a small dot in the middle of your forehead it makes it go away faster but I would for sure see a doctor about some medicine
5970 2018-10-11 14:38:28 Energy independence would be best achieved through increasing alternative energy infrastructure. Oil reserves are finite. But you already know that and obviously don’t give a damn about future generations.
5971 2018-10-11 14:38:27 Ricin was not sent to the president. Castor oil seeds (the benign precursor of ricin) were sent to the Pentagon. And the shooting was the work of one individual not a mob. Do try to keep up – although I understand your intellectual equipment is a little lacking.

5974 2018-10-11 14:38:17 yeah, what a mess!  This is DESPITE Irving Oil shutdown.  Diesel is steady especially intermonth spreads and cracks, but RBOB in a meltdown. Let's see the production levels on the stats but high use of shale is yielding a lot of gas.

5985 2018-10-11 14:37:30 Wouldn't work.  Oil markets are worldwide and buying oil from one means buying oil from all.
5986 2018-10-11 14:37:23 I take it you mean oil companies. of course you can blame them, but they extract oil to sell as petrol or other fuel.  Who uses petrol? individuals in their cars. So yes individual everyday people must bear responsibility.

Good to know. There are a few reasons to boycott Unilever. The palm oil business destroys more orangutan habitat every day. AND their CEO is a  Empire tool poised to become a replacement for George Soros.
5991 2018-10-11 14:37:00 Brazilian #crude grade exports rose 234,000 bpd last month, to their highest since April and breaking 3 consecutive months of declines. Strength from Sapinhoa, Lula, Roncador, Papa and Frade grades more than offset an absence of Iracema exports. #oil #OOTT

6001 2018-10-11 14:36:28 Carry on but the figures have been proven and that's before you take into account the correct sharing of oil wealth.

6009 2018-10-11 14:35:59 She is right engro E food was disaster by CEO Asad umer. Specially diesel generator was installed instead of Gas or furnace oil resulting in high production cost
6010 2018-10-11 14:35:57 Why are we still buying Saudi oil?  They are cold stone killers. Throw them out and sanction those royal murderers.
6011 2018-10-11 14:35:55 Why is it alright for America to send US Military to a foreign country, to hurt people in other countries?  Seems there is a double standard!  I don't approve of anyone being hurt here or on foreign soil! Oil companies need to use their profits to hire their own help!
6012 2018-10-11 14:35:51 In Shadow of the Tomb Raider, the villains think it is a good idea to have a shootout in an oil refinery. Good stuff there guys.
6013 2018-10-11 14:35:51 Apc always deceived masses with barrel of oil..... As at 2007 a barrel of crude oil is  less than $30,..in 2015 when PMB  came in is around $24 by now over $70 ......mind u dept cancelled now over $22b. So juxtapose
6014 2018-10-11 14:35:50 Despots of the world have NO ONE to hold them accountable atm.

6021 2018-10-11 14:35:23 You may have hit the exact cause of the problem. Most politicians in the US get a lot of money from the oil industry and related industries not to develop efficient public transportation. The US actually once had good public transportation until it was privatized and dismantled.
6022 2018-10-11 14:35:17 It’s been 4,500 miles since my last oil change in the S2000... and it’s making me feelbad. I’m just constantly saying “Sorry car” while I drive.

6038 2018-10-11 14:34:04 You do realize the oil companies invented this in the 70’s . The elite jump on it as the ultimate way to control the herd . The poorest of the poor will suffer beyond your wildest dreams . Yeah African poor will be stuck in the stone ages . Oil and gas are a natural element

6055 2018-10-11 14:33:00 1. Trump uses tougher rhetoric on Canada. Milk gets him more agitated than murder.

2. Appears not to know why U.S. has willingly backed SA. “Pay up?” It’s called oil. 

3. Be nice to know what business he and the family have there. Tax returns would help.
6056 2018-10-11 14:32:59 You just can’t kill a bad idea. “It’s Shetland’s oil” is the Passport to Pimlico de nos jours! 
6057 2018-10-11 14:32:53 It’s not the oil industry, their prices are reasonable, it’s the tax upon tax that brings it to an unreasonable price. Take a look at your natural gas bills-example. The cost of gas is a fraction of the taxes & delivery & administration fees!
6058 2018-10-11 14:32:51 Andy Scheer says "regulation" Lol. I can just picture him negotiating regs with big oil. Not a good look.

6068 2018-10-11 14:31:43 Oh, I think CPC announced their climate plan when Scheer told Indian PM he will deregulate energy in Canada to ship more oil and gas to India.

Key word being deregulate
6069 2018-10-11 14:31:38 So apparently @realDonaldTrump is still thinking what actions to take against #India coz we are purchasing oil from someone they don't like. Boohoo, but India will do whats is in the best interest for itself, go build ur #wall first and keep the promise u made before election.
6070 2018-10-11 14:31:36 Looking good for tomorrow. US Markets seem to have steadied, Crude is down and USD looks to be under control. The Financials and Oil & Gas Sector seem to have bottomed out so not much room for fall. Will continue to sell CE only if it opens up tomorrow. Upside is limited

6085 2018-10-11 14:30:27 Under Buhari, $25billion stolen in NNPC, N1.4trillion stolen from oil subsidy, 18 unregistered companies lifted oil, diverted N1.1trillion, N18billion from IDP funds, N25billion stolen from National Health Insurance Fund, NHIS, and many more stealings. Vote out Buhari in 2019!

Could Israel be using Goldman Sachs loyalists and powerful globalists to push US intervention in Syria as a challenge to Russias international dominance in natural gas?

6092 2018-10-11 14:29:33 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

This is the oil that leading MotoGP bikers like @petrux9 use for the most powerful rides #OutrideAnything with Shell Advance AX7.
6095 2018-10-11 14:29:15 That itself is a stopgap. Even if climate change is ignored, we have a finite amount of fossil fuels to go around and peak oil has already happened (even though no one really wants to talk about it).
6096 2018-10-11 14:29:13 Iran:

Saudi: War in Yemen, critic disappears in the consulate, killed or kidnapped.
Trump: "I am concerned about it. I don't like hearing about it," 

Buy arms, sell oil and you'll get away with anything :)
6097 2018-10-11 14:29:09 I had forgotten the big lobbying for tobacco with the NRA and Insurance in the spotlight, but them and oil is still in the government

6105 2018-10-11 14:28:23 The trade war will affect global supply chains,slowdown in global economy which could trigger low demand for commodities such as oil which Nigeria sells,FX earnings,FX reserves may be impacted.Nigeria imports heavily, there will be imported inflation.Nigeria needs to diversify.
6106 2018-10-11 14:28:16 Well is our Finance Minister concerned about Canada's balance of trade, the importing of oil from oppressive regime, and the exit of investment from the energy by Canada lack of a competitive business framework instituted by this government?

6111 2018-10-11 14:27:38 The struggle for a rapid just clean energy transition is hampered by the power of dirty oil money. Clean energy is not the problem. Corporate rule is the problem. HJR48 is the solution. Money is not speech. Corps are not people. @MoveToAmend

6115 2018-10-11 14:27:04 When we don’t need Saudi oil anymore, we willstop supplying weapons.  We need energy independence, it starts with more US drilling but it ends with cheaper renewables and eventually no fossil fuels. Buy Tesla!
6116 2018-10-11 14:26:43 I don’t make one, no. I could try and make a palm oil free African black shea butter soap with eucalyptus oil and or peppermint oil when I am back at my workshop middle of next week. Shall I keep you posted if it works?
6117 2018-10-11 14:26:37 Just got word from Oil, Gas, and Mining about a Salt Wash dinosaur destroyed for road fill from small plot of private land sw of Green River, Utah. Brought in chunk of rock yesterday to confirm dino bones. Sad..... nothing illegal. I love getting told after the fact.

6121 2018-10-11 14:26:23 My papa checked it and I got oil.  he said I need to get an oil change tho. Lol
6122 2018-10-11 14:26:22 I don’t think anyone thinks this is the beginning of an oil crash.
6123 2018-10-11 14:26:19 I'm glad I'm not from or don't live in a small town. Niggas would talk about me like shit at the local wal-mart. "girl there go Chris. You know that nigga like baby oil on his nipples right"
6124 2018-10-11 14:26:10 Deforestation for soya, palm oil etc. Cattle should graze and eat fodder in winter. Intensive rearing with concentrate feeds needs to stop.
6125 2018-10-11 14:26:01 Brining experiment completed! It doesn’t matter what form these olives are taking.... brining or Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  2018 is an excellent crop and harvest!
6126 2018-10-11 14:25:59 Idk which one of my internet searched were rigged, but no. I am not interested in Cannabis oil. Or medical marijuana. Thanks google.
6127 2018-10-11 14:25:54 Day off and getting things done! Oil change, then get to clean the house 
6128 2018-10-11 14:25:52 Hello i need support on my palm oil business
6129 2018-10-11 14:25:52 Not only did I fall off the surfboard and get reef rash but I’ve also taken a reaction to the wax they use on the rental boards so now I’m sitting like an idiot whilst this old Greek woman smothers me in some “home remedy” cream that I’m pretty sure is just 99% olive oil 
6130 2018-10-11 14:25:47 I see it’s common oil now. Clinging on to it by the fingertips
6131 2018-10-11 14:25:41 Catch me around school huffing eucalyptus oil because these sinuses won’t clear themselves
6132 2018-10-11 14:25:38 Oil company?
Be very sure it is a well structured oil and gas company before you end up in a groundnut oil and kerosene company .
All the best .
6133 2018-10-11 14:25:37 Back in our day it was made of harmless stuff like flour, mint oil, and mucilage was just plant proteins.
6134 2018-10-11 14:25:23 I wish i had a ting that would take my car to get an oil change. I feel like i have no free time these days

6137 2018-10-11 14:25:12 very similar to the European year of Margarine in 2007 celebrating the fact that it is the same consistency in all 27 members states regardless of temperature cos it's made from refined tractor oil and dinosaur gelatine

6139 2018-10-11 14:25:02 Dentist, oil change, workout, birthday dinner. Short to do list but I just wanna stay in bed!
6140 2018-10-11 14:24:56 Maybe I could change the oil in my car or mow my yard also? 
6141 2018-10-11 14:24:48 It's as if Burna Boy was advertising Cooking oil in that Yawa Dey video
6142 2018-10-11 14:24:46 Ahh, my bad. I forgot trump was into oil & money deals with these people. It makes a little more sense now because trump would sell his mother for the right amount of money! Thanks for refreshing my memory!

6148 2018-10-11 14:24:33 THANK GOD!  However, Trudeau will anyways which in the end will destroy Canada economically!  Look at TMX!  Canadian oil selling for $18/barrel while US oil sells for $70/barrel!  Sad!
6149 2018-10-11 14:24:30 Weren’t you the one who said it is death of democracy in Karntaka? Didnt utter a single after Courts verdict.!! Why aren’t you putting pressure on central cabinet regarding rising oil prices?? Why couldn’t you question BJP for details of Rafale?
6150 2018-10-11 14:24:24 you buy oil at O’Reillys, you don’t get oil changed there.
6151 2018-10-11 14:24:22 Definitely, intern with the oil company...
Gives the edge
6152 2018-10-11 14:24:06 Plus the Left media cant talk about all of that cause they need to get paid and the other media wont say anything i'm sure cause Nexus and other big donors to the Left media etc wanted the oil pipeline in North Dakota($$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$).
6153 2018-10-11 14:23:56 Dipped my fingers in hot oil 5 times  making doughnuts yesterday, I wonder why i didn't learn from the first time.

6159 2018-10-11 14:23:31 China does the same, as do many others. Saudi is key to our policy in the middle east, and could disrupt the Western economies as they did in the 70's through oil  but something has to be done to express our displeasure.
6160 2018-10-11 14:23:29 You need some of thee best beard oil and balm while out and about! Hit us up! Beard on! 
6161 2018-10-11 14:23:22 Yes, everyone colluded but those who were obviously colluding and involved in other criminal acts to undermine the USA.  The GOP can only sell Snake Oil, and America is buying.
6162 2018-10-11 14:23:05 They sell lots of oil, and without our support they'd be overrun or overthrown in a New York minute.  So same thing.

Just a question since I'm curious about it, have you ever tried CBD oil or cannabis to help? I've been considering it too
6167 2018-10-11 14:22:55 CBD oil is a lifesaver.. coupled with SAM-E, coffee and a sneaked cigarette now and again.. I just might live to fight another day. 
6168 2018-10-11 14:22:53 So we’re not aloud to support people that talk sense we’ve got to listen to far left that talk out there arse for the sake of diversity left wing government used to be good when it was for the people now it doesn’t want to offend the oil rich country’s utter joke
6169 2018-10-11 14:22:51 as oil is in Seasum, Vedanta is in you, As oil is in musturd - Knowledge is in you, As oil is in almond - God is in you, As oil is in flower - the joy is in you, As oil(butter/ghee) is in milk - the truth is in you, all are hidden need to grind or churn then you may able to see,
6170 2018-10-11 14:22:45 Is it only me that bases the worthiness of a Caribbean takeaway by how good their curry goat and oxtail is cause some places just run ya belly. Especially if they don’t add curry powder to the oil before they start cooking meat 
6171 2018-10-11 14:22:41 But Kate, all you feminist academics are getting *so rich* "selling this snake oil." (BTW, dinner last week at your villa on the Côte D'Azur was divine! Will you be a Davos again this ski season?)

6176 2018-10-11 14:22:24 Sorry man. From a son of a mechanic, I will tell you this. For every 100000km change gearbox oil, fan belts, timing belt and shocks. The rest check the dates for service. You will be safe always.
6177 2018-10-11 14:22:16 At last, some common sense. Now lets start working on reducing that oil price deferential. #abpoli #cdnpoli
6178 2018-10-11 14:22:15 I’m so glad that you didn’t put the oil on side and drink it.

6182 2018-10-11 14:22:01 If the people do not have competent leadership, nothing will happen. Enterprises were evacuated to the Urals. There were making gasoline tanks guns ammo motors planes food clothes for the army. it required a lot of iron oil of meat bread. It was arranged by someone you think
6183 2018-10-11 14:21:50 Zero oil?
6184 2018-10-11 14:21:49 CBD oil on avocado toast...that sounds SERIOUS, Jenni! I'm glad you're okay.
6185 2018-10-11 14:21:39 Not really sure what "oil subsidies" (though I would agree) has to do with NPR's lack of bipartisan reporting. I guess I'm too dumb to understand what indoctrination is.
6186 2018-10-11 14:21:39 I hit this oil before I came into work today...set
6187 2018-10-11 14:21:36 Well that’s awesome! So, gonna do something about relaxing regs on coal, oil, methane, radiation (RADIATION), continued deforestation, selling off national parks, please add those things I missed...

6192 2018-10-11 14:21:27 Intern, oil company...trust me,  work experience is key
6193 2018-10-11 14:21:23 I’m looking at my wallet thinking, do I get my oil changed ? Or do I go out for my birthday? And honestly I think if I don’t get my oil changed I won’t survive to see 20.
6194 2018-10-11 14:21:23 Problem is that any shaking or troubling to the Saudi dictatorship will make oil prices simply skyrocket.
6195 2018-10-11 14:21:23 Glowing skin: Massage your face daily at night with almond oil and honey mixture and wash it with cold water after few minutes.

6197 2018-10-11 14:21:20 yeah palm oil is v bad for the environment but not all meat subsitutes include those stuff and not all vegetarian meals have to include meat substitutes and i agree about fashion there needs to be more sustainable fashion brands that are affordable because fast fashion is baaadd

6201 2018-10-11 14:20:53 Fuck I gotta get an oil change before my car blow up.
6202 2018-10-11 14:20:46 China has been trying to get saudi and iran to stop trading oil in USD for a few years.
fakenews cant help themselves.
6203 2018-10-11 14:20:44 Except they'd be getting a rebate for not just gasoline and home heating, whatever they want, when we price the heaviest polluters. Even Exxon - the biggest oil company in the US - is on board with carbon pricing, but sure, I'll take Doug Ford's opinion over industry leaders.
6204 2018-10-11 14:20:42 We'll let England off with all it,especially all the money from the oil they've had & wasted on London

6208 2018-10-11 14:20:14 the oil plummeted in price, what more can anyone do about that? You're comparing a south American country who's economy is based on oil production and prices? To the UK's economy which isn't based on oil production and prices?, lmao You sure you know who's best to vote for?
6209 2018-10-11 14:20:05 Shaving with coconut oil helped me with razor bumps

6219 2018-10-11 14:19:22 Oil!
6220 2018-10-11 14:19:21 Data is indeed the new oil, if you are not careful then it ends up all over the place and cleaning up the mess always takes far longer than you would ever expect.

Why can't we stop that finding alternatives - electric battery, bio fuels, why delay in taking such actions or research.  We burn our hard earned to outside, not family India

6238 2018-10-11 14:17:46 I agree. There is so much potential to this plant other than smoking it.
It's medicinal uses are huge
You can make bio plastic from it  We should be all over that one
It produces high quality oil, and not for smoking For industrial applications
We are missing it's real value here

6245 2018-10-11 14:17:15 It strikes me as bizarre that CA is an oil state and I live within 50 miles of several refineries, yet this part of the state has the most expensive fuel costs of one of the most expensive fuel cost states.

6250 2018-10-11 14:16:59 True, but Shetland becoming an independent nation is highly unlikely. Plus, marine borders would have to be agreed with the UN as arbiter and most the oil would still be in Scottish waters.

6253 2018-10-11 14:16:37 Thanks for that. My recently posted forecast is for early 2019 and $90 Brent may in fact be bullish but the hysteria may take awhile to subside. I believe that oil prices are about $7 or $8 over-valued WRT to present futures prices.

6290 2018-10-11 14:13:40 The world’s biggest trading houses said they foresee #oil prices not falling below $65 per barrel and possibly breaking above $100 next year as U.S. sanctions on Iran reduce crude exports from the Islamic republic

6299 2018-10-11 14:12:59 Is that why our oil exported to the US is discounted $40.00 in the west and we pay world price when importing it back from the US and others down east? You are a bubbling fool if you think you have a plan that's working.  #EnergyEast #cdnpoli

6311 2018-10-11 14:12:09 You’ve probably already tried it all but I would think any milk with calcium might help. Trader Joe’s has a fairly innocuous rice milk-If you add a little organic almond oil  to it and Pulse it  in amagic bullet.and use turmeric in stir fries etc. good relaxer. You’re a great mom
6312 2018-10-11 14:12:08 You don’t love your body just cause you say so but don’t take care of it. 

That’s like saying you love your car but you don’t clean it, get the oil changed, etc.
6313 2018-10-11 14:12:07 I’m worried about it not running well. I hope it’s just an oil change and quick maintenance issue but the next stop is diagnostics before inspection anyway so we’ll see

6357 2018-10-11 14:08:02 #Nigeria’s economy faces significant risks in the days ahead, as the country is currently having difficulties getting buyers for its crude oil in the international market.

6363 2018-10-11 14:06:50 Coconut oil and butter in . My bro tried it and he said it's delicious and the coffee buzz stayed longer
- not a coffee drinker but can imagine it's a good combo of flavours
6364 2018-10-11 14:06:39 I see. So the occupation of the Golan heights,  the sell off of its gas and oil to Rumsfield and co and the attempts to create a greater isreal by stealing Syrian land is now anti Semitic?  Well I never.... every day a school day.
6365 2018-10-11 14:06:33 確かにIAEAのOIL値は被曝後1-6日後の測定を前提にしていますし、ひょっとすると摂取シナリオも慢性摂取でなく急性摂取を使っているかも。（もっとも福島の甲状腺スクリーニングからの線量評価も、あとでWBC結果のCs137量からI131量を比率で推定するために急性摂取シナリオでやり直されましたよね）

6368 2018-10-11 14:06:08 I did not know this was a thing but I agree. Mixing the two can have unexpected effects plus using CBD oil is really delicate, not the province of a busy bartender (IMO anyway). I feel like an old person yelling at clouds over here...

6376 2018-10-11 14:05:26 Palm oil is a huge issue. We need to tackle this as well as reduce our meat intake drastically. There is no argument here whether or not we need to protect our rainforests. They are banning palm oil in biofuels - which by the way is not the solution. We need to go further.

6382 2018-10-11 14:04:35 Mr. Penn, in the 70's, the oil companies did their own research and ID'ed that climate change was real - they started building off-shore oil rigs higher to compensate. Trump asked for a seawall around his Irish golf courses for the same reason.

6385 2018-10-11 14:04:26 And don't get me wrong. The U.S. does care about terrorism WHEN that terrorism destabilizes the region in a way that hurts U.S. interests.  I'm sure individual soldiers and a few politicians might 'really' care about it for its own sake. But overall, oil is the raison d'être.

6397 2018-10-11 14:03:14 My opinion on "Saudi Barbaria" hasn't changed since 1991:

1. Get off foreign oil (we could do this in 10 years if we really wanted to).
2. Go peaceably about our own business.
3. Laugh at them while they starve to death.

6423 2018-10-11 14:00:35 Saudis don't need our support. As Susan Rice runs for office in #Maine with all her Iran interest in oil we should look at the obvious problems with Saudi oil interest within the US and the positions those people hold. #DrainTheSwamp

6433 2018-10-11 14:00:15 The problem is they will probably never get out of a technological level of our middle ages.  With all the essily available oil and coal gone, there will be no technological stepping stone to advanced technology.  We only had (have?) One chance at this

6437 2018-10-11 13:59:55 Absolutely correct they used revenue from those industries to prop up their failed monetarist Friedman experiment. By the time she was ousted the best part of the oil revenues were already behind us. Scotland needs to take back it's country kick out the English rapists.

6445 2018-10-11 13:59:10 Alternatives to fossil fuels are not practical as yet. Until then fossil fuels will be needed. Even electric cars require fossil fuels. They have parts made from oil, need oil for moving parts, and each tyre is made using 7 gallons of oil! Oil is essential to our lives.
6446 2018-10-11 13:59:05 It’s crazy to me that oil is the most important natural resource in human history other than water and people know nothing about it

6451 2018-10-11 13:58:40 well for now it seems the practical change will be to take oil off the global market no?   need to look at the numbers but that certainly seems to be the market's expectation (given runup in price)
6452 2018-10-11 13:58:33 Unfortunately, Trudeau will keep consulting forever with them.  Never ending consultation that ruin Canada economically! Look at TMX!  Canada is currently selling its oil for $18/barrel compared to US oil at over $70! Sad!

6492 2018-10-11 13:54:49 There seem to be a lot of ill educated comments and post on here. For instance CBD oil has a trace levels of THC is the part of the cannabis plant that has the psychoactive effects! You would not have any so call high with CBD Oil and it’s not addictive. And helps with pain.

6500 2018-10-11 13:53:57 I'm all for eeking out natural resources (why make carrier bags out of oil!!) but wind and solar are not appropriate for the UK and the infeed tariffs mean people are paying upto 4x more for their energy than they should be. 
Nuclear is currently the only viable option I'm afraid

6512 2018-10-11 13:53:19 Thanks for being honest and straight forward. I think the same way. When those people start supporting our Canadian oil industry I'll return the favour. There are a lot more people affected by the oil industry than the dairy industry.

6565 2018-10-11 13:48:37 think problem iran (and europe) face is that it takes more than using the euro to be beyond the reach of US sanctions -- straightfoward for iran to sell its oil to europe for euros (1/2)

6591 2018-10-11 13:46:21 I know China has cut back on buying some sort of gas from the US. Trump has definitely listened to Henry Kissinger, as he believes that those who own the natural reds ie the oil and food in the world, rules the world.

6629 2018-10-11 13:42:45 I'm out of shampoo, conditioner, leave in, oil, foundation, mascara, and I need a new razor. The worst.
6630 2018-10-11 13:42:40 Even a broken clock is right twice a day, though I hate to even grant him that.  That the American government is involved in the Middle East to secure oil is, however, hardly a secret at this point. It's certainly not the kind of conspiracy theory that he normally trades in.

6634 2018-10-11 13:42:07 No bother Scotland are leading the way in renewable energy. We do not need the oil like many independent successful small countries don't even have but you have got to admit its a lovely wee bonus

6638 2018-10-11 13:41:54 This is how Saudi's think, you need a lot of wells to produce oil so you need a lot of assassins to "punish" a journalist. Hopefully he was abducted and is alive.
6639 2018-10-11 13:41:52 Dentist? Bruh be ur own dentist and try oil pulling but still u know its only twice a yr
6640 2018-10-11 13:41:47 It's so hard to keep up to date on AB, if only there was a way to do so remotely ;-) And I assume you are kidding about Trump. % US voters who believe climate science is 53%, AB it's 54%, ROC it's 72%. AB is more like US than ROC. You don't think that's related to the oil patch?
6641 2018-10-11 13:41:40 Gary, what you’re missing is that canadian business is doing its part. Use the oil sands as example and compare what they’ve done to reduce pollution over a given period, 20 yrs?and compare the results with any other oil producing area. That would be meat and potatoes reporting.
6642 2018-10-11 13:41:24 What if the U.S. intentionally rejected the metric system knowing their wild oil consumption would eventually have adverse effects on the environment? To stop our understanding of how small global temperature changes can make a massive difference they created a different system.
6643 2018-10-11 13:41:18 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed

6646 2018-10-11 13:41:06 Brazil can be an oil game changer if politics doesn't interfere with Petrobras and the oil fields auctions.

6654 2018-10-11 13:40:06 interesting that the oil price is down with the recalcitrant market..so oil has been trading on perception of future earnings or as a gamble like other movers on the market...

6666 2018-10-11 13:39:14 There is a man wearing sunglasses on the bus at 6:30am. He’s also very chatty with the driver. He’s talking about building oil pipelines?
6667 2018-10-11 13:39:10 America clearly became a laughing matter for the world.

6671 2018-10-11 13:38:40 The takeaway China is NOT buying US crude! The combination of tariffs, sanctions on Tehran, and the decision to sell off the US Strategic Oil Reserve to pay for tax cuts is impacting gas and home heating costs.

6761 2018-10-11 13:29:13 Nope. I've been watching the science of this my whole life. It's real. It's happening. Stop getting your news from oil companies. Also I don't have any money, there's nothing to get.

6764 2018-10-11 13:29:07 when it comes to oil, it is the "others"
6765 2018-10-11 13:29:02 Saudi have been massacring Yemeni people, they're starting to get the feeling they're untouchable because of their oil money.
6766 2018-10-11 13:29:01 We are currently playing bingo.  In tge last ten minutes I've managed to tick off Norway,  oil, gers.  It's great
6767 2018-10-11 13:28:56 Two companies including Valero Energy UK Ltd have pleaded guilty to health and safety charges, 7 years after 4 workers were killed at the Pembroke oil refinery.
6768 2018-10-11 13:28:53 Then go to Russia. Most Americans want nothing to do with your country where the terrorists came from on 9/11. So go be on your own. Also most Americans don’t want Trump in office. We don’t need your oil or your racist sexist bs.
6769 2018-10-11 13:28:45 Never mind, saw all the replies! I hope it clears up soon! I find doing a double cleanse with an oil based balm such as banila clean it zero, Clinique take the day off or fancl and a really gentle non foaming like stratia velvet milk helps me when my skin is really acting up!
6770 2018-10-11 13:28:25 Never thought about how devastated I would be about knocking over my bottle of beard oil and watching it spill out onto the floor
6771 2018-10-11 13:28:23 The folks who brought us 9/11......America is bought and paid for because of Oil and Arms deals.....Sad.
6772 2018-10-11 13:28:13 Ahahah. Muntik ko na lagyan ng sauce at chili oil. 
6773 2018-10-11 13:28:11 Of course he won’t.  They are business partners.  It’s about money and oil.  Nothing else.
6774 2018-10-11 13:28:06 You forgot to note the increase in heating oil and natural gas used for heating this winter.  They predict oil users $70 more and gas users $30 more.
6775 2018-10-11 13:28:03 Amen to this position, Senator Rand Paul. WTC came down, in part, due to the Saudi terrorists. Get off the crude oil teats of the Kingdom and let them eat cake. Their own people shall fix this tyranny.

6780 2018-10-11 13:27:23 Since #OilCoin will be denominated in benchmark barrels of oil, a payment in OilCoin can be converted into any currency - not just dollars.  The result is that trade will be based on real commodity value and will not be indexed to the dollar.
6781 2018-10-11 13:27:20 Only if the Government was proactive enough to have built new refineries and free up funds for the mainstream development.Oil prices are rising but the Nigerian economy is not efficiently maximizing the oil gains.
6782 2018-10-11 13:27:15 The problem Iran has here is that the sales are limited, the oil has to be sold at a discount and the middleman have to be paid so reducing Iran's revenue.
6783 2018-10-11 13:27:15 Right cuppa tea and then oil the work top

6785 2018-10-11 13:27:03 Yeah, I think I was a dumbass and used CBD oil. It tasted like burnt fish. 
6786 2018-10-11 13:27:02 I have just been putting it on my toothbrush and rubbing it around the inflamed tooth after I brush regularly. There is also oil pulling but that is kind of gross to me. It helps reduce the sensitivity and, according to some of what I read, can help encourage new tooth growth.

6790 2018-10-11 13:26:48 Yeppers that my point. I have a basic philosophy, that can be summed up as follows, 'are they going to boil me in a pot of oil then eat me?' If not i'm not going to worry about it. But abandoning the constitution and civial rights, as the Dems have, that crosses that line.
6791 2018-10-11 13:26:36 there will be spare for oil? Flights suddenly cost double what they did. Car trips triple, and plastics x4. Home electricity too. Energy security issues? All oil related. oil is essential to the functionality of modern economies and having oil at $300-$400 will just reck mayhem.
6792 2018-10-11 13:26:30 The EU WILL support a membership application from an independent Scotland !
Which currency will Scotland use?
We’ll use whatever rUK wants to buy oil, gas, water, food and drink, electricity with!
6793 2018-10-11 13:26:28 @SteersSA your fries are too too oily you guys. and also, you need to use clean cooking oil.. ( @steersHatfield)

6795 2018-10-11 13:26:13 The guys are scared of elections,they know they lost and will hang on normatter what.They will sell the even e flies in e country just so they can stay.With the Muzarabani oil potential they will sweettalk the rogue investors and gvts to stay longer
6796 2018-10-11 13:26:12 his kumbaya routine does not fool Texans..we know he will vote in lock step with @SenSchumer ... @SenTedCruz may not be as likable but this isn't a popularity contest..We vote issues and Cruz will vote to protect Texas' interests.   Oil & Gas being a big one..
6797 2018-10-11 13:26:12 Thats nice, some might argue that the Bushes gained advantage due to the sacrifices of american blood while indirectly protecting family's investment in Saudi Oil.
6798 2018-10-11 13:26:11 Teak and sandalwood essential oil is essentially fresh baby smell, btw.
6799 2018-10-11 13:26:03 2000 yrs ago maybe!  Now you are Trump's pet! I am of native decent....so you are wrong again. The other part is French, who befriended the natives and fought with them. Saudi only survives today because of oil and money. Keep killing women and children coward.

6803 2018-10-11 13:25:30 Thanks for the article Mc G.   "T" was STUPID for pulling us out of the Paris Climate agreement. Scotty & big oil "greasing" "T"'s pockets to the detrement of our planet.

6805 2018-10-11 13:25:19 Savings, real estate price, higher oil.

6809 2018-10-11 13:25:07 Yeah.... I just got shaken up... I happened so fast. And I was less then 20 km/h! But the floor is shit because of the first rain, there's oil allover
6810 2018-10-11 13:24:56 via muddywatersre: Maybe the real reason Saudi SWF invested in $TSLA wasn’t to diversify away from oil. If Autopilot could improve, it’d be a much easier and more reliable way of kidnapping regime critics. cc: @elonmusk $tsla
6811 2018-10-11 13:24:48 But then oil  was up. Paul look at the labor department statistics. I’m tapping out, but  nice chat.

6817 2018-10-11 13:24:36 Things people never mention in the #media is when #trump says the USA is now the highest producer of oil which is true.(Finally using reserves) Take that #BlueWave #ResistanceRises and other countries lowering oil prices :p with lower taxes/gas the economy is stronger #MAGA #vote
6818 2018-10-11 13:24:32 Need to get an oil change today.
6819 2018-10-11 13:24:31 This is the environmentally safe way to move oil?
6820 2018-10-11 13:24:29 Makes sense.

Avoids penis envy
6821 2018-10-11 13:24:24 This shouldn’t be coming as a surprise. The general atrocities committed by Saudi have been overlooked for  years and instead been rewarded with large military arms contracts and continual purchases of oil. The western world has essentially ignored their proxy war in Yemen, too.
6822 2018-10-11 13:24:21 Our everyday actions hurt some living thing. Some hurt is more visible than others, leading people to call for bans on leather, while proudly wearing plastic/synthetic alternatives made from oil.
6823 2018-10-11 13:24:04 Muhammad Bin Salman (M.B.S) is a thug. M.B.S will give more oil to Trump and his puppet senators (democrats and republicans) then Bolton/Pompeo/Kushner/Haley (a group of smooth criminals) will announce the innocence of M.B.S and this Khashoggi's blood will be lost for ever. Shame
6824 2018-10-11 13:23:56 the Taliban as if it was just an afghan thing. The Saudis were said not to be in favor of the family, etc. even though they were finding madrasas and terrorist training centers in Pakistan...
The things America has done for oil...

6830 2018-10-11 13:23:28 It's kinda funny when reasonable people turn journalists 

As value investors they could construct the same argument against oil or FX, as these are speculative vehicles with no intrinsic value ...
6831 2018-10-11 13:23:23 Thanks for sharing, Josh. It seems like you know a lot about this issue. What's your opinion on reaching out towards Africa and the oil and gas industry there? Curious to hear.
6832 2018-10-11 13:23:12 ladies if you have acne try tea tree oil! it really works (but smells) (but it works)
6833 2018-10-11 13:23:12 Shares of state-run oil exploration and production firm ONGC gained  2.86%. Shares of state-run gas transmission major GAIL (India) rose  3.98%.
6834 2018-10-11 13:23:07 Already gone and purchased some beard oil for the other half!
6835 2018-10-11 13:23:06 Shares of state-run oil and gas firms rose as global crude oil prices  declined. Among oil marketing companies (PSU OMCs), HPCL (up 14.7%),  Indian Oil Corporation (up 5.39%) and BPCL (up 5.11%) edged higher
6836 2018-10-11 13:23:05 Correction: Saudi Arabia is basically ISIS with oil money. Their PR sucks, but anyone with arms to sell them doesn't care.

6841 2018-10-11 13:22:40 True! Thank you. And you know why, right? They got $$ from big oil.
6842 2018-10-11 13:22:37 That’s what I thought?! I could maybe understand a little lotion for babies with naturally dry skin, but oil?!
6843 2018-10-11 13:22:30 Basically any matchbox style cars will work.  They have rules for war rigs too so you can use oil tankers or school buses.  Youre basically limited by your imagination as far as cars go.  And if you play 40k dig through your bits box for weapons!

6851 2018-10-11 13:21:39 If Donald Trump was really a "great negotiator and developer", he would rise to the challenge of significantly reducing CO2 and CH4 via combined engineering solutions (wind/solar/nuclear/hydroelectric), reduced reliance on oil/coal, more/better public transport, and carbon tax.
6852 2018-10-11 13:21:28 It’s not just “libs”. Some of these SCIENTISTS are Republicans. There are millions of pieces of data. I have direct access to a lot of it, through a family member. Would you like to read it? We are the only country ON EARTH with anyone who doubts it- those are paid by big oil.
6853 2018-10-11 13:21:27 So what happens if we cut production by 2m barrels? then 4m? How pissed will the american consumer be? how high will oil skyrocket? $150? $200? $300? what happens when our $70bn defense budget is diverted from all US to China/Russia? and we stop selling oil in USD?. Economics.

6863 2018-10-11 13:20:06 If I remember correctly the people were angry at Saudi Arabia then but the Relationship  based on oil resources, the reason we back them militarily, would not allow the Government to express any backlash and there was a big push to say that those who did the crime were
6864 2018-10-11 13:19:58 Self massage never really works sadly enough, Heating pads or hot baths can also help relax overworked/tight muscles. Even a vasta/sauna should help a bit. Rosemary essential oil applied directly can be very helpful too. Good luck
6865 2018-10-11 13:19:54 Joys of no kids. I'm OCD with all my gaming crap. Discs remain brand new. Not sure how i'll have kids. I even use wipes on my controllers before and after using to get oil marks off. Make people wash their hands before using, etc. It's scary
6866 2018-10-11 13:19:51 At the garage getting oil change. Overheard the owner tell a customer regarding high cost of repairs at the dealership: never have your car serviced at a beautiful building.
6867 2018-10-11 13:19:46 @realDonaldTrump I know we still import oil $20B yr. We don't need to saturate the market, while folks at home struggle

I appreciate Melanie's opinion of your personal traits and agree with her but its a Legislative position.  I'd like to see your ideas.
6875 2018-10-11 13:18:28 Anyone who thinks the Saudi’s are a partner with America is a person mixing oil and water.

The Saudi government is a ruthless, anti liberty, oppressive regime. If it is proven they killed Jamal Khashoggi, we should cut off every dollar of support and all military hardware.
6876 2018-10-11 13:18:22 The lady next to me just said she’s getting an oil change because it’s due in 1,000 miles...

6880 2018-10-11 13:17:53 BBC News - Jamal Khashoggi: Turkey's Erdogan urges Saudi Arabia to release images. you can be sure the time lapse has allowed the Saudis to clean the entire place so there is nothing left as proof. stop buying oil from  Saudi
6881 2018-10-11 13:17:50 Yet we still have to buy their oil.  The Saudis know they have got us (i.e. the western world) over a barrel, LITERALLY.
6882 2018-10-11 13:17:28 I just completely disagree! You have either been deliberately misled by the oil and coal industry and the puppet politicians they have in their pockets, or - worse - you are doing the misleading.
6883 2018-10-11 13:17:27 What’s missed here is the country will continue to be driven by US conservatives for the next couple years. Hello oil companies, climate change fight is lost, and progressives take a back seat, sex abuse on the rise, guns on the rise

6887 2018-10-11 13:17:24 Here is the market view:  TRADING HOUSE OIL PRICE FORECASTS FOR 2019:
Glencore (Alex Beard) $85-90
Vitol (Ian Taylor) $65
Gunvor (Tjborn Tornqvist) $70-75
Trafigura (Jeremy Weir) - expects “triple digits” with average near $85
6888 2018-10-11 13:17:24 Well maintained cars are safer cars, so it’s important to make sure you change your oil on a regular basis. Regular inspections are also important to make sure that all the parts of your car (engine to tires) are working properly.

7022 2018-10-11 13:06:50 Holy crap, I link you to multiple articles from the scientists who literally study hurricanes everyday for a living and you accuse me of being on the take from the oil and gas lobby... out of curiosity exactly how short was your short bus?
7023 2018-10-11 13:06:47 I don’t know about what high end teachers make but the expats in oil and gas earn 10 times what the alleged average salary in Vietnam make...
7024 2018-10-11 13:06:44 Did Obasanjo, Jonathan & PDP 16 years reign consider any infrastructure devt with billions revenue accruing from oil? This is visible in pmb & APC era. Checkout.
7025 2018-10-11 13:06:38 @CamHeyward Hey my bearded brother! If you're looking for a 100% all natural ingredient beard oil check us out! You won't be disappointed!
7026 2018-10-11 13:06:38 We both like oil?
7027 2018-10-11 13:06:30 its not (just) oil executives - it's politicians, princes, oligarchs, the selfish rich and lobbyists - look at USA deniers, Australian coal industry, middle east despots. List for immolation is very long.
7028 2018-10-11 13:06:29 Harsher actions against Saudi? that will bite you in the ass. We have levers to pull:
- Repeat of ‘73/‘74 Oil embargo
- Start buying up arms from Russia/China
- Start selling oil in Yuan/Euro/Yen
- Sell US assets
As if those would be allowed to happen by any US administration.
7029 2018-10-11 13:06:24 Without British passports it's debatable just how many British were in the Falklands in 1981. All that oil and gas was a real bonus though wasn't it.
7030 2018-10-11 13:06:23 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
7031 2018-10-11 13:06:22 There are 10 most indebted African countries to China... .Ethiopia takes #2 spot with $13.5B of debt. Of course the second oil producing nation in Africa, Angola taking the first place with $25B debt from China.
7032 2018-10-11 13:06:07 How much is the Palm oil industry paying you to protect them insteadt of the Rainforrest and the orangutangs
7033 2018-10-11 13:05:56 @Alwaleed_Talal @Mohamme88819167 Saudi Arabia monopoly on oil market and achieved welfare an adventure that soon can end. The fact that I know how to end this monopoly are dangerous for you, I don't threat, I propose a deal, 100 M on change for cooperation. Contact me.
7034 2018-10-11 13:05:36 This is why I love the band Architects, listen to their song “Black Blood”, relatable af, it’s about climate change.   Black blood being the Earths oil.

7041 2018-10-11 13:05:02 Absolutely - women need empowerment and to be heard.
Side note - USMCA new provisions giving Uncle Sam a few more rights to scrutinize foreign decisions? Giving US full access to Canadian oil and water. WTF
7042 2018-10-11 13:05:00 Don Lemon is media propaganda misinformation smear sticker smooth talking forked tongue genius at self deception! He believes his snake oil works even though ratings indicate opposite! Bless his !

7046 2018-10-11 13:04:45 An endless resource which can't be used up. Which can always be filtered if polluted. Desalination is also an option to gain more access to this resource which practically rains over our heads daily. 
Last drop of oil in 20 years anyone? Typical fearmonger who wants your vote.
7047 2018-10-11 13:04:37 It just needs an oil change chill

7049 2018-10-11 13:04:02 Watching Lyin Ted's ad about energy, Beto does realize the importance of Texas's oil industry today, but recognizes the future aspiration of renewable clean energy...something neither Cruz nor Cornyn ascertains...
7050 2018-10-11 13:04:01 Actually, our Dr was just mentioning the oil, & said more & more ppl are using it. 

It has quite a stigma attached though, from the smoking of it.
7051 2018-10-11 13:03:56 Good news indeed. The new government working hard to tackle the anti palm oil campaign in Europe. @teresakok has been doing well.
7052 2018-10-11 13:03:52 Queen... Please. For the love of God... Keep baby oil away from your coochie... Trust me on this

Please the car must be in mint condition. Thanks
7060 2018-10-11 13:02:50 That is what the American people want, yet completely contrary to the interests all of our government that represents only the interests of multinational gas / oil corporations. They continue to do so even knowing that our environment is on the brink of unsustainability.
7061 2018-10-11 13:02:47 Dear PM you are doing too much for this nation, thanks a lot for those colourful currency and epic oil price rise.. kindly consider my application too for next defence contract. I have a bit of experience with local fire crackers..

7063 2018-10-11 13:02:44 Also if there were fewer boutique fuel blends at refineries. There can be around 20 to 50 different requirements for gasoline blends alone. There’s about 150 oil refineries in the USA. Most are operating above capacity. If there were about 50 more some could shutdown to retool

7066 2018-10-11 13:02:07 Start your research into the neo liberal movement post 1945. Then look at how loans which couldn't be repaid properly were set against nation resources. When they default the resources are privatised. This occurred wide scale during 1970's oil crisis.

If your in oil & gas, pivot to something else
7108 2018-10-11 12:58:49 Gas would be cheaper if we had:  more oil refineries (especially in high demand states that have none like NY & FL), less environmental blocks to exploration, more oil pipelines, and less gas taxes. Did a speech 5 yrs ago on the factors that determine the cost per gallon

7329 2018-10-11 12:40:00 I worked for a large Oil Company. Accepting gifts from other companies was mostly a conflict of interest so we had a gift register. If it was above board and within a certain amount (max £50 value) you could accept and declare or reject. I rejected. But I’m not greedy or #corrupt

7333 2018-10-11 12:39:44 Right. "Doing oil and guns together" isn't something I'd classify that as a "shared value." But I'm old fashioned like that.

7342 2018-10-11 12:38:59 This is nonsense. Cropping is destroying the soil. Animal agriculture rebuilds the soil. If there is to be any agriculture at all you MUST have both. The oil and coal industries are very keen to SELL the message that meat is the problem. Don't be fooled into believing them.
7343 2018-10-11 12:38:57 Perhaps now it is a good time to tell the oil companies to fuck off and take a SERIOUS look at alternative fuels.
7344 2018-10-11 12:38:57 What about when they crap on you, is that some kind of oil leak??

7380 2018-10-11 12:36:35 I would wager that most oil isn’t sold to individuals but rather used in operations such as the transportation and production of goods we consume - many of which are necessities like food, hygienic supplies, medicine, etc. a delivery truck driver can’t really boycott oil sadly.

7392 2018-10-11 12:35:41 Tooth pain is THE WORST. A few things I did when I was broke:
1) Pulling. You suck oil b/t your teeth until it feels gross then spit it out. I used safflower oil. It helped but was a temp fix.
2) Dental schools offer cheaper services. Need to  have flexible schedule. Shop around!

7402 2018-10-11 12:35:17 Saudi Arabia is a rogue state whom it seems frightens USA ? They have sponsored more terrorist groups than any other country and been proven but nobody challenges them it’s all about the black gold (oil)
7403 2018-10-11 12:35:16 “We like the oil they love the bombs”. Britain’s role in Saudi extends way back so of course

7405 2018-10-11 12:35:08 Even if your local mix is 100% coal today (it isn’t), an EV is still the better choice, because it will improve over time and a petrol car won’t.

Hell once “easy” sources of oil give way to disasters like tar sands, the petrol car will get much worse over time
7406 2018-10-11 12:35:08 We won't do shit because we're in bed with them. We sell them weapons and depend on their oil. Trump even has businesses there. They're literally committing genocide in Yemen with the weapons we sold to them. We won't lift a finger against the Saudis

I know we can drive fuel prices down because America can sustain itself. If you do that the middle eastern market will crash & we all know the middle eastern countries depend on our money to buy their oil.

7607 2018-10-11 12:15:46 The first hundred years or so we were building oil dependence, even pollution wasn’t understood, let alone climate change. That means markets weren’t functioning—people didn’t have the necessary information to make a decent choice, plus infrastucture and markets incentivize oil.
7608 2018-10-11 12:15:40 I made the best chocolate raspberry pudding cake inspired by a @Nigella_Lawson recipe. Basically substituted oil for butter and flax seeds for eggs. It's the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten, counting all the ones from my pre-vegan days.

7695 2018-10-11 12:07:00 Omg, refined coconut oil is a game changer for donuts (well, fried food in general). Because it’s solid at room temp, the donuts don’t seem greasy as they cool.

7697 2018-10-11 12:06:44 You do realize oil has been heavily subsidized from the get-go, right? And still is? In the mid 1800’s oil was incredibly expensive to refine, government aid pushed it along, provided the initial infrastructure, and mitigated much of the costs. That’s never stopped, only grown.

1) Take decisive action on corruption. Something needs to be shown on this front
2) Hindus are feeling betrayed, regenerate the Hindutva fervor /pride

I'm a big fan of cabbage, so much flavour. Love to toast some sesame seeds in a little olive oil then add a little butter, sliced white cabbage & black pepper, put the lid on the pan & saute-steam on a low heat. Finish with a dash of lemon juice or raspberry vinegar.

7909 2018-10-11 11:45:57 Our debt was climbing and the economy crashed hard well under the CONSERVATIVE PARTY. Long before the NDP came to power. Why? Because you never diversified our economy and bought votes so our Heritage fund was essentially empty. Which was created to help us through low oil prices
7910 2018-10-11 11:45:57 There’s a cream my Aunty hooks me up with called duac (it’s on prescription) but it basically reduces the amount of oil produced. It’s for people with acne, I don’t have acne but that shit with pear soap in the morning makes you feel clean

7923 2018-10-11 11:45:09 Now that crude oil price has gone up the Buhari administration hardly talks about economic diversification. 

Nigeria's debt profile is rising. soon, economic recession would set in, then we would begin to hear of ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION. 

I am just Atikulating.

7932 2018-10-11 11:44:37 The point is to use less oil, to use other sources of energy. Using oil got us into this mess of #climatechange. Transition to other energy sources is necessary whether we like it or not.

7976 2018-10-11 11:40:29 So long as the peso is weak — it will drive oil up, which in turn will drive inflation up in a vicious cycle.

But the peso is weak because ultimately who wants to deal with Duterte?

7987 2018-10-11 11:39:16 dollar have gone up but fuel prices have gone down, so  #گھبرانا_نہیں_ہے If dollar had hiked globally the oil prices have increased too. It is another propaganda by the looters of Pakistan to buy all the dollars from exchange companies and supply rupees.
7988 2018-10-11 11:39:14 This argument will no longer be valid. You have to quantify the achievements in terms of ground realities. Oil price increase and un able to prove any of the corrption charges against opposition is going to be a big setback if proactive measures are not taken.
7989 2018-10-11 11:39:06 Yes, uur great desire for equality of outcome is the reason why so many highly creative people have gone south of the border. The exception to this trend was Alberta's oil and gas sector that has attracted top talent to come and stay here. No wonder Justin wants to kill that off.
7990 2018-10-11 11:39:01 *Put more oil on the kart* Heh HEH heh #Dingobot
7991 2018-10-11 11:39:01 *For record purposes only.*

For the records, oil price under *PMB is now $85.03 * N361 = N30,695.*

 Under GEJ $85.03 * N150 = N12,754 

or $110 * N150 = N16,500.

8036 2018-10-11 11:34:56 US stock futures are off 0.8% with both Asia and Europe lower. Gold is $1,207 with oil at $71.92. Stock futures have actually improved from 2 hours ago. Trade concerns and interest rates are weighing down market energy.  I am ordering the markets to do 50 jumping jacks.

8112 2018-10-11 11:26:40 It’s about time our government got with modern times and made CBD oil and medicinal Cannabis legal. My son has Chrons Disease and meds work well at the moment but if they all failed I’d hope that this would be a legal option
8113 2018-10-11 11:26:33 Ahhh - I missed this upcoming date, childcare means, sadly, I won't be able to make it. I always need a bit of a run-up to plan for things like that - its like redirecting an oil tanker!!!

8117 2018-10-11 11:26:15 Yesterday crude oil was at $85+ & today crude is  $81.16 .
It is a fall of around 5% in a day. But petrol & diesel price in India will again rise tomorrow. Ideally if petrol & diesel are market linked, there should be atleast  ₹3 to ₹4 reduction in oil prices.
8118 2018-10-11 11:26:08 Is the pan hot enough or it's the oil maybe you need to put more? next time but that's okay you'll learn from it :))

8181 2018-10-11 11:19:26 Scheer talked about how his government would be reviving energy east to get oil to India. They discussed the USMCa deal. It was a "warm reception" Indians in Canada can be heavily influenced by who Modi supports so it will likely turn into votes if his trip is successful.
8182 2018-10-11 11:19:17 Can't wait to tweet a new photo of Aaryan. Now that I've got my tab back. His mom likes to apply oil to his hair, like typical Indiam mom. I normally object, but today she bathed him & applied oil when I was out. So I returned& shampooed his hair.

8193 2018-10-11 11:17:56 Most states require an alternative fuel sticker to be renewed annually. The money for that is for roads/infrastructure. Also, oil is still highly subsidized....perhaps it’s time to see if oil companies can win in the market on their own!
8194 2018-10-11 11:17:53 Well the SNP lied about oil being a bonus, fracking being banned, Leonard being a brexiteer and so on.

8202 2018-10-11 11:16:08 You are right that what happened in Athens was not related to drilling. But ultimately investing in renewable energy is the way forward.  Greece could be a leader in that field.  Aegean and Med are already overfished; oil will make that worse and the risks are enormous.

8245 2018-10-11 11:10:53 This incident reminds me of the event on 9/11 where the airspace was temporarily opened for 15 planes of Saudis to quickly exit the country after the devastating terrorist attack. Saudi Arabia is out of control for having lots of oil money. #KhassogiDisappearance

8249 2018-10-11 11:10:34 The @rcpsych is to review its opposition to the legalisation of cannabis. This is big news because much of the research the government has used to keep cannabis illegal has been conducted by the college's  researchers. I hope they opine on #CBD oil too...
8250 2018-10-11 11:10:33 No your argument is invalid. The EU most certainly is all imposing. So imposing in fact that Scotland does not meet the necessary entry requirements and most likely never will. Current Scottish fiscal deficit incl oil revenue 13.5bn.good luck.

8264 2018-10-11 11:07:47 DOT regulations have made it almost impossible for single truck owners to stay in business, especially in the oil field. Also the new ELD mandates cause trucking to be more unsafe because everyone is now racing the clock. Does the President have any plans to help us?

8294 2018-10-11 11:03:24 I know hash oil saves lives. It stops my Crohn’s disease in its tracks and lets me have a normal quality of life.
My only comment is the date 2013. Rick Simpson didn’t invent hash oil. It has been around for a long time. Indra invented BHO in 1999.
I think it goes back further

8338 2018-10-11 10:57:28 Yes, but his meaning is clear: current price levels won't last for more than about 45 days.

8408 2018-10-11 10:49:28 Every Trump economic initiative is inflationary.  HUGE fiscal stimulus in a tight labor market. Trade war.  Higher oil prices. Higher stock prices via tax incented corporate buyback programs. Trumps increased growth is done on America's credit card.  It is not real, sustainable

8512 2018-10-11 10:37:26 Yes. International law will force maritime lines to revert to their original once we regain our independence. However, I suspect we will GIFT WM some oil fields in order to escape the union during negotiations.

8555 2018-10-11 10:31:45 How did you remove it? The safest way is to cover it in oil and leave it for AT LEAST half an hour to soften the adhesive and then peel it off really slowly. Taking it off in the shower also helps
8556 2018-10-11 10:31:40 I don't see a scenario where Big Oil is ever going to endorse "we should lose access to financing and go out of business" at a time when there is still demand for their products. 

Is cutting off demand through policy not more effective than targeting supply?

8612 2018-10-11 10:23:26 Gulf oil is in the south. Shipping costs a lot. Plus higher tax rates in more progressive states.
8613 2018-10-11 10:23:23 You only get the credit if you owe the tax. I do, getting my model 3 in three weeks. You’re obviously getting paid by oil, am I right?
8614 2018-10-11 10:23:16 Right, because oil use going up means we should never look for something different. You need to open your eyes and grow up, the world is changing and we have to change with it or we are going to have to suffer the consequences

8626 2018-10-11 10:22:02 The problem with oil the West is too dependent on the Middle East.  We all seen how the Iraq war was a failure.  Never again, let's development our own energy resources.

8629 2018-10-11 10:21:40 Why didn't someone tell me that the #WinterofDiscontent in the UK 70s was more to do with an embargo against Iran's oil by the US state supported by conservatives and nothing to do with @UKLabour ? You wont learn that in college. I need more history lesson on world politics.

8632 2018-10-11 10:21:25 How about investments and promotion of wind , solar hydro electricity. Promote electric cars , ebikes, electric heat pumps. Invest in new tech for batteries. Subsidies for industry to convert off oil to new tech. No pipe dreaming taxation

8634 2018-10-11 10:21:06 Interesting to see oil adn other fuels drop with the market.  Has oil become a finance play vs a commodity?  Wonder if most oil contracts are financed vs cash transactions?
8635 2018-10-11 10:21:04 Judge Robert Altham, who jailed fracking protesters with 'excessive' sentences, has family links to oil & gas firm!
The family business supplies the Irish sea oil & gas industry and is believed to be part of supply chain for Centrica, which has invested 10s millions in fracking!

A case of a recently settled Chinese family whose issue was the relationship between the parents, obviously. You're clutching at straws on this. Cannabis oil is a different story
8638 2018-10-11 10:20:35 Suspect energy harvesting push (natural gas, oil) will keep energy costs in reach while pedal to the metal greed goes way beyond tipping point.

8648 2018-10-11 10:19:54 Exactly. It makes my point. The US doesn’t want or need the oil for themselves(which is what lefties usually argue),they just want to deny it to the other side. They’re in Syria for other, equally bad reasons.

8669 2018-10-11 10:16:59 Aye, in fact the main change someone like me can make, to my knowledge, (uses public transport, no kids, waste system auto sorts recyclables) is eat less beef, say no to working in the oil sector and vote appropriately (a fuckton of norwegians miss that last one though)
8670 2018-10-11 10:16:57 Yes, at the end of the day, with that move, the oil corporations could earned trillions of dollars in a short period. That's it. Like someone said: "It's the economy stupid"
8671 2018-10-11 10:16:50 Never, never fight oil burning with water!

8675 2018-10-11 10:16:24 A relevant situation exists in Syria. US forces will not relinquish oil rich areas in the NE back to Damascus in order to starve the Syrian Government of the oil revenues and associated business/development opportunities.

8682 2018-10-11 10:14:45 #FaisalRazaAbidi is handcuffed for criticizing judiciary on valid issues. Meanwhile, Sharjeel Memon is smirking at how the Chief Justice failed in prosecuting him despite catching him red-handed with the bottles of 'honey' and 'olive oil' in his hospital room. Murder of justice.
8683 2018-10-11 10:14:41 What are the most common problems found with heating oil tanks? 
8684 2018-10-11 10:14:21 European oil and gas majors typically spend 1%-5% of capex on low carbon. What will the industry average be in 2030?
8685 2018-10-11 10:14:12 If I were a climate science denier, or big oil lobbyist, I’d love every time somebody emphasised personal sacrifices for individuals to counter climate change, rather than stressing need for governmental leadership in clean energy, insulation, energy-efficient public transport…

8702 2018-10-11 10:12:27 I don't want to speak on this matter again. We exited recession because oil prices improved not because govt policies worked. South Africa exited because agricultural sector grew.

8742 2018-10-11 10:05:22 Aye, peanut butter is a good one. Seen a few that are 100% peanuts/no palm oil. Even a cheapy Tesco own brand one. Does need stirring if left for anytime though as the peanut oil tends to separate and rise to the surface. You can see what the palm oil in other butters does.
8743 2018-10-11 10:05:21 Rubbish.  But dint worry we will take back our oil and chuck the landed gentry off the estates so the people can use rhe land properly
8744 2018-10-11 10:05:21 Global commodities prices were working in their favour especially oil prices. Hence even with note printing (which I doubt was too overwhelming) they managed to maintain a good inflation rate.

8769 2018-10-11 09:59:58 Is it true that USD100 is fetching ZWBond500 on the black market? If true something is not quite right in the Zim macro-economic policies.

8827 2018-10-11 09:52:09 Price of barrel of crude oil & exchange rates:

Now under Buhari:
$85.03 * N361 = N30,695

Under GEJ:
$85.03 * N150 = N12,754

$110 * N150 = N16,500

So, the Buhari admin is earning almost DOUBLE the amount GEJ earned.

Keep this in mind when they say they made no money

8904 2018-10-11 09:41:04 This is missing that filling stations dont have the electrical capacity to provide this sort of service this is either an oil company trying to make use of asset or someone that doesn’t understand network restrictions.

8960 2018-10-11 09:33:25 The problem is that there isn’t time for that gradual shift, the world is moving fast. Nigeria is a rich nation blessed with oil wealth but trust soon and very soon oil is going to be worthless like coal. If we need to build our nation is now
8961 2018-10-11 09:33:20 The same in the 1970s when the world's experts were predicting that the planet's oil reserves would be completely exhausted b the year 2000.

9031 2018-10-11 09:22:20 You all are DELUSIONAL. When April, 2019 arrives, middle class tax burden will increase, & for those of u who haven't done the math: Surprise! Tax bracket & tax burden aren't the same thing. With the rapid rise of inflation & interest rates, the snake oil salesman fooled u again.

9164 2018-10-11 09:01:35 @Space_NK hi I’ve had a reaction to the herbivore lapis oil after using it for 2 weeks. At first I wasn’t sure it was that, but it’s made my skin on my cheeks flare up red, itchy, flaky and bumpy. Is there anything I can do as this was a lot of money & I am unable to use it now

9195 2018-10-11 08:56:37 I submit that the judge sentenced imprisonment as a deterrent against all who seek to disrupt the oil and gas supply chain through direct action.

The Judge's family business is part of that supply chain, albeit not the immediate chain in the case. But the deterrent benefits him.

9269 2018-10-11 08:44:21 Not sure if this is going to bring anything. All the more urgency to become oil independent from SA.

9273 2018-10-11 08:43:47 Someone will have to lose, clearly, because someone will sell less coal and oil than they planned to. And those someones are spending millions to protect profits of billions. This thread is BULLSHIT

9276 2018-10-11 08:43:28 I’m always kind to you, am I not? One should always suck up to a provider of quality oil 
9277 2018-10-11 08:43:27 @realDonaldTrump We are exempted from our red line. On November 4, sanctions must be fully implemented, the ceasefire should be cut off, and Iran's oil exports should reach zero, 2.5 million barrels of Iranian oil should be cut off completely
9278 2018-10-11 08:43:09 When did oil start to rise? What works do you personally want to see done that haven't?
9279 2018-10-11 08:42:57 As a matter of interest how long (time/mileage) would it generally take for oil to end up that state???
9280 2018-10-11 08:42:51 @realDonaldTrump China and India will have to completely cut their oil from Iran by November 4, otherwise they will face the most severe and most severe sanctions in the US and will leave the US markets. We will never accept China or India.
9281 2018-10-11 08:42:39 I gotta keep smoking this hopium. TSX doesn't look too good, Canadian house bubble looks like it's gonna pop, and oil can barely break resistance, so if every rugs getting pulled I have this. Haha.
9282 2018-10-11 08:42:39 .@sophie_Ed1984 yesterday u heard me urge Le Houérou to divest equity from intermediaries linked to oil & gas to protect my generation (1/2)
9283 2018-10-11 08:42:20 This has nothing to do with oil drilling but with shipwreck of a very old ship. Tankers must be checked more carefully by the Greek state.

9297 2018-10-11 08:40:26 My industry works with oil, gas, solar, and wind energy.  Solar and wind power will take years, if not decades, to even break even. If it wasn't for government subsidies, they wouldn't exist right now.  So no, there isn't money to be made there.
9298 2018-10-11 08:40:25 @dineoranaka @leratokganyago I have heard from Dr Axe youtube channel he says some essential oils like soakinh yourself in the bath and put few drops of lavender oil helps, but yeah she must seek medical help but what her man is doing is being a jerk #AskAMan

9307 2018-10-11 08:39:06 This reminds me on early exploration of oil and technologies that depended on it. In early days even small amount of R&D payed massively in terms of efficiency and allowed many to enter. First divergently expanded, but then came downward pressure.

9323 2018-10-11 08:36:47 Ask yourself where the price per barrel oil was prior to the 2016 and where it is today. The industry was glutted with product and oil producers were bleeding revenues because the need for production was zero.  Oil is one of the big industries who put Trump, ETAL where they are

9385 2018-10-11 08:29:29 These companies are providing the fossil fuels, not burning them.  They should be criticized for discouraging alternatives and casting doubt on climate science, but not for supplying energy the world demands.  Who is buying and using all that coal and oil?

9405 2018-10-11 08:26:38 Thank you! The blue isn’t as intense as the red, so hopefully I’ll not lose too much when I get to the oil stage. The red needs knocking back. I was inspired by Den of Imagination’s Mortis work.
9406 2018-10-11 08:26:10 In a large pot over medium heat, heat olive oil then add onion, bell pepper, and carrots. Sauté until soft about 5 minutes. Add garlic and jalapeño and cook until fragrant, 1 minute and no need for salt since mr. @jamieeast got too much for us :))

9411 2018-10-11 08:25:32 They should get the works done, they should stop pointing fingers n telling what's stopping them from keeping their promises. Oil is constantly rising, so nothing will stop them from working till they re voted out.

9416 2018-10-11 08:24:29 A good summary. WTI is due a good pullback. Long term, the US will bring on more shale oil, so will the Canadians, then the rest of the world will find shale oil and by then 60% will be renewable, 30% will be nuclear, leaving a big fat 10% for Oil
9417 2018-10-11 08:24:11 Sure, because the oil lobbies haven't spent millions trying to do just that

9421 2018-10-11 08:23:30 No, The US as a whole is, it uses 20mil barrels of oil a day for 300Mil people. China uses half for 1.3billion people. Your pentagon is the largest single purchaser of oil in the world. this has been going on well before Trump. Your pollution of the planet is largest per capita
9422 2018-10-11 08:23:28 In a similar vein, I sat next to a stockbroker on the Eurostar last week. He held a very large short position on @Tesla and was determined to see the company fail so he would make a profit. Turns out he is also a major investor in oil & gas companies.  Who'd have thought...

9489 2018-10-11 08:13:45 Respectfully disagree.Its a sign of lack of confidence that BP has sold its stake. It doesn’t want to commit people and money into the Libyan oil sector but is happy for an incumbent (ie ENI) to run things. Hence no risk for BP,only upside.

The way you live your lives, is not our way.
If you want to live here in OUR COUNTRY, amongst US, then it's YOU who MUST learn to ADAPT. When in Rome ???? At the moment we're like OIL & WATER!

9557 2018-10-11 08:01:50 I'm voting NDP. Proudly. Notley dealt with the oil crash by diversifying and stimulus spending, all while not raising taxes on working people,  cutting frontline public sector jobs, or gutting heathcare or education.
9558 2018-10-11 08:01:46 My sister Ruth sent me this and I concluded Zim has issues -Hi I'm looking for a neat Honda Fit.

9560 2018-10-11 08:01:40 Before @MBuhari tenure at least 27 states or close were owing salaries. This man has given 3 bailouts funds including PDP states and even those collecting 13% oil derivatives. Hatred for him is just the problem.
9561 2018-10-11 08:01:37 I'm just do a hot oil treatment this s*** is thick as a f***
9562 2018-10-11 08:01:36 Oil is important. Base of the modern economy. Everything you eat or touch is connected in someway to oil. I think a nuclear economy is carbon neutral, lets us get to the electric economy we will eventually go to sooner and result in Saudi/Russia/Iran as poor and w/out power
9563 2018-10-11 08:01:28 Glad you not acting like henny is good and it don’t taste like car oil ppl on here swear it’s the best drink
9564 2018-10-11 08:01:17 I think only one has a political statement about the continued viability of an industry in which the judge is invested... do you rly deny that, given the polarised debates about oil and gas, and the inappropriate sentence, that the judges interests being blatant screams of bias?
9565 2018-10-11 08:01:11 @Europcar_UK you should be absolutely ashamed of yourself. I hired a car from you for a work trip (18 plate) after a 4 hour drive the engine started smoking where your incompetent staff hadn’t checked the oil levels...After filling it up... ‘low tyre pressure’  USELESS! AVOID!
9566 2018-10-11 08:01:08 VanAuken:”Before Khashoggi’s disappearance, an estimated 30 Saudi journalists had already been imprisoned or disappeared, without any protest from the Western powers, the US chief among them, who sell billions of dollars in arms to the kingdom and profit off its oil wealth.”
9567 2018-10-11 08:01:00 Oil extraction in Ogoniland devastated its farmlands, virtually eliminating fish and wildlife, threatening livelihoods. Ken Saro-Wiwa led a peaceful movement to defend his homeland and its people but was executed following a trial that was widely criticised. #luhistbhm

9570 2018-10-11 08:00:45 Ha! In fact, at stage I still had nothing but a little oil in the pan, and was about to fry the eggs before making the krapao itself. Once I'd stopped shaking, I did those and then the krapao, and all tasted great ;)

9577 2018-10-11 08:00:24 Saudi citizens were responsible for 9/11. The Bush family protected Saudis and attacked Iraq because oil is thicker than blood. Saudis entertained Baby Blimp with a shiny object in their sand box. Jared got a loan from Saudis. Saudis own two Trump camels.

9588 2018-10-11 07:58:37 Oil is that currency.
9589 2018-10-11 07:58:36 Shetland wouldn’t be entitled to an EEZ if it remained part of UK; it’d be a UK exclave within Scotland’s EEZ. If independent it’s have to negotiate its own EEZ with Norway, Denmark & Scotland. It’d be much less than 200 miles & contain very little in the way of oil.
9590 2018-10-11 07:58:10 The support from the US and UK, the demand for their oil is the only thing that have prevented either having their neighbors invade them and or their own people revolting and overthrowing House of Saud and their cronies

9597 2018-10-11 07:57:21 Nothing to do with causing oil to spike because of my fuck up with Iran and also nothing to do with my brainfuck chinese tariff idea
9598 2018-10-11 07:57:12 Yeah this is a problem we have in the US as well. Theres still a lot of communities and counties that still run on natural gas. So they end up getting strong armed big time. God I remember when I lived in a house that used oil heating. The cost to refill that damn tank...
9599 2018-10-11 07:56:44 BS imo we've found them long ago it's just being covered up like technologies that could change our world over night for the best but the super powers to be don't want to loose power over the oil/gas/macro$ system we are slaves to everything would be free/clean energy #truth

9602 2018-10-11 07:56:32 I know the average Saudi wants to be a modern person in a modern country in a modern world but the dinosaurs in charge want to keep their power and keep their country in the Middle Ages since is the only thing keeping them wealthy besides the oil
9603 2018-10-11 07:56:23 It being the best cooking oil doesn't make it available. I was talking about availability. I haven't seen it for more than a months. The crisis only started like last week

9611 2018-10-11 07:54:47 Tapi kan ketika pertamina naikin harga jadi 11.000 harga SPBU swasta tetep diatas pertamina. Harga crude oil bukan satu2nya penentu harga jual pasar. Ada mekanisme tertentu yg urg pun ga begitu paham.

9621 2018-10-11 07:53:37 On 23/02/2013 Sri Lanka recorded highest oil prices in its economic history when petrol reached Rs.170 as the global oil prices were at $114.23. With the latest Oil Price revision petrol price is Rs.169 just one rupee below historical high and the Brent is at $82.
9622 2018-10-11 07:53:35 4.... I know we have massive food & drink industry. I know we have massive renewable sector. I know we have massive natural energy potential (oil/gas). I know we have a young vibrant mti cultural welcoming society. I know that if we had control over finances we'd make it better

9624 2018-10-11 07:53:11 I know deep down House of Saud is afraid of its own people and are afraid that one day their oil will run out and those they oppressed for decades will turn against them. That’s why they use their wealth to finance radical jihadism and to be a totalitarian regime
9625 2018-10-11 07:53:02 As a direct result of weak corrupt Irish political leadership by FF FG Labour & Green in EU it has cost the Irish people their seas with stupid Fish & Farming quotas & 120 billion 42% of all EU bank debt & our Oil Gas metals that lot are after our water FG are a Brexit disaster.
9626 2018-10-11 07:52:36 Kalau mekanisme penentuan harga pasar berdasar harga crude oil aja, logisnya SPBU swasta gak naikin harga terlalu tinggi
Dengan crude oil harga $100/brl udah untung jual harga Rp.9500, ketika crude oil harga $70/brl dengan harga jual Rp.9900 biar sesuai ketentuan juga dah untung

9630 2018-10-11 07:51:49 You used whataboutery! Went straight in with Venezuela trope. Tell me about OPEC and Saudi Kingdom impact on oil prices. How about USA sanctions? Black marketeering. Or how you’ve been living with Socialist policies all your life  but it doesn’t work

9634 2018-10-11 07:50:27 I’m not wealthy. Do you know how much of your money subsidies oil companies? You should mobilize against that, that’s the one that’s going to kill us all. Additionally, subsidies are not meant to be forever. They’re designed to help scale new tech by making it more aforadable.
9635 2018-10-11 07:50:13 Because thats when Sheikh Mansour took over with his dirty oil money.
9636 2018-10-11 07:50:10 A tiny minority of retired cranks and oil industry paid shills disagree. But go ahead and be a dimwit that cannot think critically.
9637 2018-10-11 07:50:08 Grandma just told me cooking oil is $20 in shops today. Zimbabwe never learns.
9638 2018-10-11 07:50:02 And God has given such an amazing gift ....tea tree oil. Thank the heavens for a powerful weapon. It repels bugs, clears out scars and impurities, and defends against the hoochies.

9646 2018-10-11 07:49:06 I think you’ll find it doesn’t.
Eg 45% of canola is recoverable oil, so 55% of canola (pods/skins/pulp) is ‘waste’ ie technically, most of it. 
So it’s fed to stock. Otherwise it is a waste
Figures are bullshitted about by anti ag and repeated by the ignorant

9650 2018-10-11 07:48:04 Sorry for the delay. I am not much active here. The issue is that the service centre   wont allow us to bring our own oil for vehicle. That is how they make money.

-Bbm pertamina Rp.11.000 (harga minyak turun tapi ada sesuatu yg bikin harga jual bbm naik)
-Bbm swasta (?)
9656 2018-10-11 07:47:16 Exactly!  Crude will go down only.  Those people who claimed gold would go up with oil are talking about recession and hurricane now. Anything that fits their positions.

9666 2018-10-11 07:45:50 There are many systemic reasons why MOST people in the US cannot give up driving, and many of those reasons are supported by companies who can pay big money to keep it that way.  Also, 100% of all food purchased contributes to oil production and sale.

9673 2018-10-11 07:44:38 Oil is under 70$ a barrel. That equates to 70c a litre. In 2008 gas was 1.52 and 150$ a barrel. Something stinks.

9676 2018-10-11 07:44:18 They just picked a fight w the Saudi's whom they need to keep oil prices down. Tarriffs, tax cuts, dod spending ...

Every Washington policy is inflationary. And debts are massive.

Soon the chickens are gonna come home to roost.
9677 2018-10-11 07:44:03 They'll jack up the rates of anything oil gas related to punish us....
9678 2018-10-11 07:44:02 All pension funds have oil and gas investments, so nobody is exempt from ‘links’
9679 2018-10-11 07:43:42 Zimbabwean jails will humble them. No cooking oil, no soap and no water
9680 2018-10-11 07:43:24 As the Law Lords said to LJ Hoffman: "Judges are well aware they should not sit in a case where they have even the slightest personal interest in it"

If your family is connected to gas and oil, you should not sit on a case involving the protection of the gas and oil business.
9681 2018-10-11 07:43:21 Oil will need to mostly go anyway. Renewable power and EVs for transport.
9682 2018-10-11 07:43:17 Hi I'm looking for a neat Honda Fit. I have 100 USD ,10 litres pure drop cooking oil,4kg sugar and a 20kg bag of mealie meal we can negotiate with bp tablets as well. Please the car must be in mint working order thanks
9683 2018-10-11 07:43:13 You anoint my head with oil, my cup overflows 
9684 2018-10-11 07:42:33 Oil Prices fell as it extended big losses from the previous session with prices hit by an industry report showing U.S. crude inventories rose more than expected
9685 2018-10-11 07:42:27 My goal is to turn this oil into paper, this time next year I wanna own or co own a oilfield company
9686 2018-10-11 07:42:18 Thats how I had a dream that @iam_Davido gave me 30k and beard oil ..... even my dream mocks me for not having beards 
9687 2018-10-11 07:42:17 [She also costs a lot. Which is good. Because I have too much oil.]
9688 2018-10-11 07:42:04 Had a dream that somebody on here found a deleted scene of Splatter with an eyes-clenched-shut face mask, getting covered with oil, then @ThomasTankMerch posted a reply of the same face mask still stained with oil but on that large Trevor... and I woke up feeling disappointed lol
9689 2018-10-11 07:41:56 The big LNG project everyone is excited about is Shell oil. Foreign interest.
9690 2018-10-11 07:41:55 Same here. Enough oil to grease a pan 
9691 2018-10-11 07:41:51 Yeah people need to realise that united will not be able to compete long term with clubs that aren’t run on the profit motive. What if Qatar raise the market again with a £500m signing? nothing to an oil state but very few clubs could cope with that.
9692 2018-10-11 07:41:37 I don't think I would stop eating Any cuz the list long.

9695 2018-10-11 07:40:49 Those two examples are clearly like us; drunk on oil. Tell me about China. Tell me about India, tell me about Ethiopia brother.

We are not serious about creating an economy worthy of our "giant of Africa" tag.
9696 2018-10-11 07:40:45 People are suffering President, talk is cheap, cooking oil is very expensive.
9697 2018-10-11 07:40:44 I’d be extremely surprised if Kevin Maguire’s pension scheme didn’t have shares in oil and gas.
9698 2018-10-11 07:40:44 Just as we begin to see an improved revenue from crude oil, this demon that frustrates Nigeria’s breakthrough is back again! It works through the vested interests that hold our commonwealth instruments like oil blocks, banking licenses, government revenue collection contracts,
9699 2018-10-11 07:40:41 U do know that the only other party had been in power for 16 years and has practically ruined their economy with corruption and made one of the largest oil producers Petrobas go down under..u r a universal patwari journalist.bus kuch kehna hai

9704 2018-10-11 07:40:01 Ko what’s funny, if I’m not mistaken this is clearly a cooking oil ad nd he is promoting the brand nd I’m pretty sure some  celebrities promote brands nd get paid.
9705 2018-10-11 07:39:50 Oh, good: Susan Rice, married to a Canadian up to his neck in Canadian Tar Sands oil, and, coincidentally, I'm sure, pushing for the Keystone XL Pipeline, still. Not that it'll make her richer or anything. Oh. Wait. It will!
9706 2018-10-11 07:39:10 Energy minister of the #UAE says country began raising #OIL production in 3Q18, and will continue to raise output in Oct and Nov in line with market requirements. #oott

9711 2018-10-11 07:38:46 It's not Cadbury's anymore. Sold to global corporation Kraft which uses more vegetable oil than milk which is why the chocolate isn't as good as it used to be. They don't have the ethics of the original founders.
9712 2018-10-11 07:38:35 The problem is the stuff I can’t avoid like dealing w litter box. Getting in and out of bed. Muscles have started spasming which is making it much worse. But I just used a giant spray of cbd oil and am gonna try to sleep. Thanks for showing proof it gets better!

9714 2018-10-11 07:38:08 #OIL on Boil- OPEC can't afford prices to move up further. It will quicken discovery of alternate sources of energy around the Globe. So it is in the interest of major oil producing countries to maintain price at affordable levels say$60/-

9726 2018-10-11 07:35:43 would constitute an exclave within indy Scotland’s EEZ. As such, whether it remained part of UK or became independent itself, it would be entitled to virtually no oil, as its EEZ would be small. Please educate yourself before demonstrating your ignorance of international law! 
9727 2018-10-11 07:35:41 Mirai izvo...Pane arikuzivawo kurikuwanika cooking oil here?
9728 2018-10-11 07:35:39 You have half of it right, this is not new, the kowtowing to SA for fossil fuel started during the OPEC oil embargo. Yet Trump just made a 350b deal with Saudi Arabia to sell them arms for their war on Yemen and continues to provide refueling and other help.
9729 2018-10-11 07:35:33 Baby right now I’m planning get away after get away! Not sustainable. I need to try the oil

9733 2018-10-11 07:34:51 James - it’s only about money - originating in Aramco oil ?? Much of Central London property owned by Saudis. However politicians like to spin things like democracy, it is ‘filthy lucre’ that runs the world (my Dad was right!)
9734 2018-10-11 07:34:51 My 2 cts: The illustration image shows a coniferous forest (probably in Europe or temperate forests in North America). I doubt you can replace that with African oil palm, unless climate change is drastically higher than expected!
9735 2018-10-11 07:34:37 Better than Castor oil and stametta 
9736 2018-10-11 07:34:28 I don’t think USA government care about human rights! They care about oil, money & weapons deals $.

9746 2018-10-11 07:32:55 I have my PVC sir.

I will vote a candidate that will think ways around dwindling oil prices rather than thinking borrowing. Our future is leveraged because they want to be seen to be performing.

9753 2018-10-11 07:31:33 I think if you have a really oily skin those products might be a bit too much hydration. Though the @Kiehls serums are dry oils. They are not greasy at all! I also think that even oily skins could use some oil/moisture. And of course the @NUXE lip balm is suitable for everyone!

Don't use the anal protection oil I like the Extended mobile-one oil. Good luck.

9770 2018-10-11 07:28:54 Saudi Arabia is ALLOWED to promote far-right Islamism ideals because the West has to get a long with them, why? Oil. Resources. It’s our best friend we love to hate.
9771 2018-10-11 07:28:47 As they have found oil in the region I’d say that it’s a little bit more than nationalistic fervour

9780 2018-10-11 07:27:35 The growth will come in from energy and oil stocks @TalkMarkets
9781 2018-10-11 07:27:18 According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the price of crude oil comprised 59.4% of the average retail cost of gasoline in January 2018 (the latest available figure). Federal and state taxes were the next highest cost factor, averaging 18.3%
9782 2018-10-11 07:27:13 You have oil in your head
9783 2018-10-11 07:26:54 IMF forecasts have changed. A year ago they saw peak budget and current account deficits at 5% of GDP, India's rupee was 26% overvalued and the 2nd most expensive in EM, oil prices were lower and Pakistan's FX reserves were higher
9784 2018-10-11 07:26:50 Isn't it anti competitive? Isn't this a bias against emerging technology and doesn't it discriminate in denying access to cheaper shorter term investments like renewable energy? Looks like an oil subsidy to me.
9785 2018-10-11 07:26:50 That doesn't answer why you need to use Palm oil at all?
9786 2018-10-11 07:26:48 The next time you order CBD oil, ask them for the lab results to back the purity of the product. I've got the best!

9807 2018-10-11 07:24:15 Lack of oil/petrol, meant lots of walking and cycling. Plus there was a massive reliance on domestically grown fruit and veg. Combine with good health care, people live a long time. Clearly not transferable to the UK though!

9814 2018-10-11 07:22:44 Exactly. It’s not the rises. It’s the slow turning of the oil tanker sized housing market sentiment. From ‘rates will never rise, prices never fall moral hazard’ course, to something more realistic
9815 2018-10-11 07:22:24 My face was covered in dry tears and popcorn oil by the end of that movie.
9816 2018-10-11 07:22:20 What we want - Sub-1.5L(undercutting Enfields)Dual Channel ABS,Carburetted,Oil/Air Cooled engine with kicker,6 speed gearbox,Tubeless tyres - basically a better simpler highway tourer without a cringefestival marketing like the Dominar's.
9817 2018-10-11 07:22:14 I choose @tedcruz for #TXSen because Ted is leading the fight for Texas, for jobs, for wages, and for the Texas oil and gas industry! @BetoORourke is wrong on energy and wrong for Texas! #ChooseCruz #KeepTexasRed
9818 2018-10-11 07:22:14 Start fracking at your own backyard, there might be oil there
9819 2018-10-11 07:22:13 tker: TAE GIVES KOOKIE MASSAGES SO THEY ARE IN LOVE
me: hey did you know massaging your scalp with coconut oil for 30 mins help with hair growth?
9820 2018-10-11 07:21:59 there was so much goodwill for USA in IRAN that MOSSADEGH would automatically taken help from the US Oil Cos to restart IRANIAN OIL IND: so viciously ground to a halt by the British.
9821 2018-10-11 07:21:56 Drove my Trans Am to a rural Jiffy Lube for an oil change and undercarriage check and they forced me to use a separate service well.
9822 2018-10-11 07:21:28 Broadbeans are amazing! Our fellow families in the commune love them also! Shallow fried in some hemp oil & garlic! Delicious!
9823 2018-10-11 07:21:15 Oh my God, you’re so right! I guess this storm wasn’t unusual for the Gulf! I guess global warming isn’t real and the scientists are lying and the oil companies are honest! Thank you!
9824 2018-10-11 07:20:45 Well, if he's a Russian operative, yes.  If he's a bumbling idiot, maybe.  If he's a complete nut job, then yes.  If he's only a big oil puppet, then no.
9825 2018-10-11 07:20:36 Ewww. How dirty was the oil and the filter? Was it just cooked brown or was it just strait up burnt coffee black?
9826 2018-10-11 07:20:23 yes 30 mins head massage with pure coconut oil helps with hair growth 
9827 2018-10-11 07:20:23 Harper was an excellent PM --- He is missed -- this liberal gov't has bankrupted Canada - killed its oil sands, raised taxes beyond measure and while planned immigration is beautiful, letting 3.2 million into Canada in 4 years will destroy our social welfare system-
9828 2018-10-11 07:20:05 A bunch of snake oil salesmen in that party really
9829 2018-10-11 07:19:45 Judge jails protesters who might damage the profitability of his family's oil supply business .

9831 2018-10-11 07:19:43 Help his skin. It's very hypoallergenic made with goat's milk coconut oil and olive oil I use natural essential oils and teas to scent it and can be made with any sense required to avoid allergic reactions if you would like

9833 2018-10-11 07:19:37 lol that the states can’t pay? Ordinary 18k as oil prices crashed 21 states were found wanting? The FG can afford to pay 50k Cos the can afford it but NLC didn’t consider the state govts when they were negotiating all these

9841 2018-10-11 07:19:01 Nigeria New Dictionary definition of words:
A #COMPETENT Leader dropped Foreign reserves from $64B to $29B in a period of massive oil earnings. e.g GEJ
An #INCOMPETENT leader raised it from $29B to $44B at last count.

Me: I like the Incompetent one by this definition.

9844 2018-10-11 07:18:45 You yawa your self oh why oil dey your brain 
9845 2018-10-11 07:18:36 I'm doing 1:4 ratio to cooking oil just like we do Mazoe. Situations will make you improvise! 

I remain undefeated
9846 2018-10-11 07:18:31 @atiku  Your made already and I believe the cabals will not intimate you to loot the oil money as usual.
9847 2018-10-11 07:18:09 They will be boiled in oil.
9848 2018-10-11 07:17:52 He should be banned from appearing on business channels. I remember he saying that nifty will reach 12600 by diwali and now he says nifty will go down to 9700. Why nobody is asking him questions when inspite of oil and rupee, our economy is stable.
9849 2018-10-11 07:17:48 How petrol pump could be elegal? To start PP, 1st get to change the land status, atleast 12 NOCs have to have under the chair meeting of commissioners, after the lengthy process of documents oil marketing companies would allow to dealership.
9850 2018-10-11 07:17:48 He has indirect control.  His Jihad against Iran caused the higher oil prices which are inflationary. His massive deficits are also inflationary.

The fed raises rates due to inflation threat that Trump caused.
9851 2018-10-11 07:17:19 わからん！
9852 2018-10-11 07:17:18 Don't laugh people but how many quarts of oil do you need for a oil change in a Tahoe???
9853 2018-10-11 07:17:16 The article on these companies is a bit odd too. Clearly fossil fuel is bad, but most of these 100 companies are oil or gas producers. There needs to be a focus on moving away from fossil fuel use. It would be good to know who uses the most fossil fuel
9854 2018-10-11 07:17:12 You ain't said nothing slick to a can of oil. 
9855 2018-10-11 07:17:00 You sure the income generated by London’s financial hub isn’t greater than the oil?
9856 2018-10-11 07:16:52 I just bought a cool new iPad  No blood for oil! No jet fuel melts steal!
9857 2018-10-11 07:16:36 Apply red oil
9858 2018-10-11 07:16:31 Midnight snack - pint of bone broth, 1/4t Celtic sea salt, a little dump of no salt seasoning, clove of garlic and a giant clump of coconut oil. Sweet dreams

9865 2018-10-11 07:15:43 "only if cooked in oil used to cook something else with it in..." but I had to look that up, it was a stab in the dark 
9866 2018-10-11 07:15:35 nope, can tell from the under tray that this car hasn't had an oil change in a very long time. I sheared bolts off by trying to undo them, unfortunately, can never trust a dealer or garage. which is why simple jobs like an oil change, minor service, should always do yourself.
9867 2018-10-11 07:15:22 Aviation stocks like Jet and IndiGo gained 3-7% after the government cut jet fuel price from 14% to 11% and fall in oil price. #MarketToday #MarketAction

9871 2018-10-11 07:13:59 We need their oil. Move on.
9872 2018-10-11 07:13:59 4 tablespoons organic coconut oil, 1 tablespoon turmeric, 10 drops peppermint oil extract. Optional 2 tablespoons baking soda. Coconut oil and turmeric supposed to be magical for white teeth.
9873 2018-10-11 07:13:49 Norway are thriving purely because they had the sense to invest their oil revenue rather than spend it as we did. Their oil fund is now generating more income for them than their oil fields.
9874 2018-10-11 07:13:45 Corruption has killed Venezuela economy as we speak now.

Their equivalent of NNPC was used to siphon the nation's fund in the time of oil boom.
Now, their currency is worthless and chronic poverty has taken over the land.

9904 2018-10-11 07:08:47 Turkey reports current account surplus in August $2.6bn, deficit $900m Aug last year, second August surplus in a decade (and oil was a bit more than half the price last time). Recessions - they get the job done.

9906 2018-10-11 07:08:32 Reverse engineering cannot be called invention.
Invention is something totally new in the market.

9907 2018-10-11 07:08:25 What's advantage to public by reducing Ex. Duty of ₹1.50 +₹1 by oil companies and ₹2.50 in VAT by some States, when on daily basis 20 p. to 30 p. is being increased in prices of petrol/diesel by next day by oil companies.

9914 2018-10-11 07:06:40 Unfortunately, we all know they won’t because of oil and arms sales.
9915 2018-10-11 07:06:39 A.K Antony said that #India doesn't have money but @narendramodi has paid off the $6.5 billion (about Rs 43,400 crore) oil money that #India owed #Iran #congresskifakepolitics #Congress

9919 2018-10-11 07:06:18 Been thinking for the past 3 days I’ve got an oil leak on my car. The joy on my face when I turned into work this morning to find I’ve parked in the same spot all week and it’s just a stain on the tarmac

9921 2018-10-11 07:06:07 Why is all projects centered at south west n northern region were as d south south  region is neglected ,majority of oil blocks is also allocated to d northerners ,what an inequality ,is Naija a nation or is own by few people that has compromised .

9928 2018-10-11 07:05:34 This is the worst time to have to explain to your children why they can't have yoghurt, cerevita or cornflakes because you need to stock up in fuel, cooking oil, sugar.. Et al. How do you even explain kuti economy is bad and rate is going up everyday i feel for parents

9947 2018-10-11 07:01:47 Arab World: Banking and Finance Resurgent economies in the Arab region are luring international lenders, but rising oil prices mean reforms have stalled and a crackdown on dissent in Saudi Arabia has prompted concerns
9948 2018-10-11 07:01:41 Sanctions are a rather unproductive measure and take years to have any real effect. So what do the sanctions entail, we stop buying oil, sell weapons or accept capital for our debt?

To conclude they do not punish entire populations is also debatable given the economic effects.
9949 2018-10-11 07:01:40 its politicians, large corporations, oil industry etc and your tax relieves to these is the biggest threat to our wild life and the planet.
9950 2018-10-11 07:01:30 The Nigerian Government cannot agree on a sensible national  minimum wage.  Over 15 states in Nigeria struggle to pay the current minimum wage. 
The FG cannot effectively fund education and health.
Meanwhile, oil blocks are in personal hands. Incredible!!!
9951 2018-10-11 07:01:27 I've got very few guys I keep in touch with, but two who backed me when an oil major superintendent tried to stitch me up I enjoy their company and wish I could see them more often. The rest? Hmm!
9952 2018-10-11 07:01:21 The pipeline only stopped because it was owned by an American company, but now that they have been pushed out of the oil fields  and the line is in the Turdeau government hands it should proceed smoothly.

9966 2018-10-11 06:59:13 Take away pharma ads. Hold pharmaceuticals responsible for snake oil results!!! The medications have no efficacy and are toxic. Get pharma out of FDA funding.

9974 2018-10-11 06:58:36 Hi there. All palm oil used in our own-label food products has come from sustainable RSPO-certified sources since 2015. This position is being extended to non-food products by the end of 2018. Thanks.

9984 2018-10-11 06:57:11 GREAT! MORE OF THIS! If celebrities put their $$ where their politics is, we may have a fighting chance at saving the world. Empower CITIZENS. Moral ACTION must counter immoral wealth. We’ll have to buy the world’s safety. Greed, oil & war mongers assure the downward spiral. VOTE

9988 2018-10-11 06:56:30 Stopping or reversing the destruction of our planet seems as likely as stopping or reversing the destruction of Detroit. Once the forest is chopped down and a palm oil plantation is put up, it's never going back to  orangutan habitat. The northern white rhino ain't comin back.

9993 2018-10-11 06:56:00 Dangerous game investing in oil and gas, ride the story before news , if you have the minerals hold it for gains .
9994 2018-10-11 06:55:59 Oil of cloves is a natural anaesthetic. Use a cotton bud to dab onto the sight of the toothache. It’s also antibacterial.
9995 2018-10-11 06:55:51 Transferring wealth???  Do you know where most of the oil comes from?  Have you seen the amount of money that has poured into the Middle East?  Look at pictures of Dubai 20 years ago, then now.  I think you’re a little confused.
9996 2018-10-11 06:55:50 Say it Seth.  I dare you.  Double dare you.  The real cause is overpopulation.   Not oil.
