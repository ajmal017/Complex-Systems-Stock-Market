0 2018-02-28 23:59:25 It's something, though I feel like bump stocks are their scape goat. NRA suggested it first. Meaning, they pass this they may think they don't need to pass anything else.
1 2018-02-28 23:59:22 Ridiculous.  I had a bad feeling President Trump would turn on us.  We the people, the Veterans, the Ex LEO, responsible citizens who are all shooters.  What else will you sacrifice besides bump stocks?!?!  Time for Tea Party candidates.
2 2018-02-28 23:58:56 The bill is laughable.
Bump stocks simply should be outlawed, strict backgrounds checks are common sense, and our government already tried a mental health ban for gun owners but that failed miserably because it breaks due process.
This isn't a mental health issue.
3 2018-02-28 23:58:51 @TIAA is the largest retirement fund in the US after Social Security. I tweeted asking them to divest all gun manufacturer stocks. Got a call back. Teachers - ask @TIAA to divest in solidarity with you. They need to hear.

5 2018-02-28 23:58:32 Assault weapons, high capacity magazines, armor piercing bullets & bump stocks should be illegal. We should have background checks on all gun purchases. That plus the Governor’s security recommendations should make an impact.

46 2018-02-28 23:54:26 They exist so people can have fun with them, which is a good enough reason. Banning them will achieve absolutely nothing. I don't think we nee 1 more gun law. We don't seem to enforce the ones we have now. The liberals have no intention of stopping with bump stocks.
47 2018-02-28 23:53:55 Are they still selling assault weapons? What about bump stocks?
48 2018-02-28 23:53:13 @POTUS-WOW-your really doing “something” banning bump stocks!!!!  NOT.  What BS ! We know that is just window dressing !!! People are the problem as you know NOT GUNS -so why the knee -jerk reaction???
49 2018-02-28 23:52:28 Goddamn it, this will hit my stocks with Walmart.
50 2018-02-28 23:52:24 What do I meant by Fins being updated?  Many OTC stocks have Stop Signs due 2 not b-ing current with their updated Financials.  They still trade, the dif now is that thers a crackdown on those Co's putting out PRs b4 they are in Current Standing. I want Co that spend the $ needed
51 2018-02-28 23:52:18 Bump-stocks are NOT an issue. Automatic weapons are illegal,so attachments making weapons automatic should ALREADY be BANNED.
52 2018-02-28 23:52:11 They will ban the bump stocks I think
53 2018-02-28 23:51:59 See which stocks are posting big moves after the bell.
54 2018-02-28 23:51:20 I have no problem banning Bump Stocks or any device that converts a firearm into an illegal, fully automatic weapon. Fully auto weapons are already illegal and I believe the NRA doesn’t contest such a ban either. At issue is banning a rifle for all just because psychos used them.
55 2018-02-28 23:51:08 .@govrauner has been non-committal on gun control, mostly saying it’s up to feds. In statement: Gov will review bills when they get to him, was encouraged by bipartisan conversation, will work w/ ILGA to “keep guns out of the wrong hands,” to ban bump stocks, make schools safer
56 2018-02-28 23:51:03 JPY Foreign Investments in Japanese Stocks diumumkan : -53.6B sebelumnya : 127.1B
57 2018-02-28 23:50:44 How about banning assault rifles and bump stocks and INVESTING in the mental and academic wellbeing of these kids. How bout that?
58 2018-02-28 23:50:12 Trump was playing the room. People need to calm down. He’s going to push for a mental health bill and he will prob do away bump stocks. I don’t like any infringements on 2a  these are somewhat reasonable
59 2018-02-28 23:49:43 New from @GovRauner on #GunControlNow: “We will work with the General Assembly to keep guns out of the wrong hands, ban bump stocks, make our schools safer and work with law enforcement to protect our children and families.”
60 2018-02-28 23:49:41 Thank you @POTUS for your stand on gun control.Thank u for advocating raising the min age to buy guns & for restrictions on AR weapons & bump stocks. I, as well as Republican lawmakers r shocked! I am a grateful Mother.The NRA is speechless.They didn’t expect this, neither did I!
61 2018-02-28 23:49:01 President Trump promised while he was on the campaign Trail that he would not do the same things Obama did!By him Banning bump stocks executiveprivilege he is doing exactly what Obama did! This should be a vote by the Congress not by one person&a stroke of a pen!(can be reversed)
62 2018-02-28 23:48:50 Continued gov's office statement: "We are in favor of that conversation continuing. We will work with the General Assembly to keep guns out of the wrong hands, ban bump stocks, make our schools safer and work with law enforcement to protect our children and families." (2/2)
63 2018-02-28 23:48:24 So why are we banning bump stocks then? Bump stocks didn't kill people.
64 2018-02-28 23:48:22 Have you seen airline stocks today, @CaseyCagle? They're all moving in lockstep - this tweet had no effect on Delta. You might want to think again.
65 2018-02-28 23:48:17 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks...good move. Finally acting Presidential.
66 2018-02-28 23:47:40 This whole rates go higher so stocks go down so rates go lower is getting kind of old
67 2018-02-28 23:47:01 Looks like the the only people interested in "bump stocks" are the one's that didn't serve the Johnny Rambo's wannabe's.
68 2018-02-28 23:46:30 Liberals sip latte, they don’t buy stuff at Field & Stream. Dumb decision. How can it help your business or stop guns. We’ll buy from the other 30,000 places to get “assault weapons”.  I look forward to seeing your sales drop & stocks decrease over the next year. We’ll be watchin
69 2018-02-28 23:46:25 I think he did say that about bump stocks, but we'll see.  He changes his mind quite a bit.  I think he's walked back on the 21 age requirement, which I don't agree with either, by the way.
70 2018-02-28 23:45:19 You ban bump stocks, you ban guns, and only the police have them; what good are cops that won’t respond appropriately and attack the threat we need them to, since we won’t be armed?
71 2018-02-28 23:44:54 Don't forget ban bump stocks.
72 2018-02-28 23:44:42 @realDonaldTrump  Mr. President know that  2nd Ammendmet is an inalienable right & your taking bump stocks will unwittingly play into  UN's #Agenda21, #Agenda2030 and #Agenda2050's hands...we the people will not stand for that...Arrest the Police & FBI who did not do their job.
73 2018-02-28 23:44:21 Everyone with an income is an investor. Some in smokes, beer, holidays, cars... others in stocks, real estate...
74 2018-02-28 23:44:06 Bump stocks are finally being banned I think
75 2018-02-28 23:43:50 Market Close: MBS +19bps; DOW -380.83; NASDAQ -57.35; S&P 500 -30.45; 10yr Treasury 2.86%; MBS rallies a bit at the expense of stocks, which turned negative during mid-day, and kept rolling down the hill!
76 2018-02-28 23:43:41 @SenBillNelson - You DO realize the AR-15 is not an assault rifle, right? That AR doesn't mean assault rifle at all? No difference from a hunting rifle, just lighter than most? And bump stocks don't convert to automatic? You know this, right?  @thebestcloser #CloserNation
77 2018-02-28 23:43:17 @tedlieu @ChrisMurphyCT Trump asks why wasn't anything done b4? Then he says, I can get rid of bump stocks now w/exec order, don't worry about it. It's been 4 months since LV mass shooting.Nothing was done b4 4 the same reason he hasn't got rid of bump stocks since 10/1-the NRA
78 2018-02-28 23:42:53 @BarackObama 

Didn't you ban bump stocks by exec order. Now the poser @realDonaldTrump  says he will personally write an exec order banning bump stocks. 

I hope someone spell checks it first.
79 2018-02-28 23:42:42 Pretty sure he is not allowed to own individual stocks
80 2018-02-28 23:42:11 It’s probably better at moment to just focus on raising age limits,banning firearm sales, bump stocks could push them underground where private gun sales are allowed that don’t have age restrictions,rather have them sold above board where inventory can show how many sold etc.
81 2018-02-28 23:42:04 The stocks will be available to purchase tomorrow I think imma buy some
82 2018-02-28 23:42:04 Wow. I'm not impressed. History repeating it's self. Stock market, sence first crash has not changed. They raise it up, crash it, take all cheep stocks, raise it up, sell them, crash it again. Repeated ever sence.
83 2018-02-28 23:42:02 @williamlegate Haven't seen you mention that gun stocks like $RGR and $AOBC getting crushed and at multi year lows.
84 2018-02-28 23:41:58   stocks!
85 2018-02-28 23:41:14 @TuckerCarlson If Trump can bump stocks with an executive order what stops a Dem president from banning certain ammo or a class of guns ?. This will happen it's only a matter of time. This presidency is unraveling  !
86 2018-02-28 23:40:25 To put a pin on this: 
Pres. Trump backed: 
-Merging Fix NICS w/ Toomey-Manchin
-Raising the purchase age for long guns to 21 from 18
-GVRA, but with taking guns before due process
-An exec order to ban bump stocks

Pres. Trump opposed:
-Concealed carry reciprocity (for now)
87 2018-02-28 23:40:13 So wrong. I’m sure the libs love hearing that though. I sincerely hope that he’s fake posturing. Bump stocks have already passed SCOTUS right?  Why would that change?  Also, no one in their right mind would violate due process.
88 2018-02-28 23:40:00 How much of a raise did the basic workers in your organization get compared to you? Did your organization buy back stocks? Not saying you don't deserve a raise. Families living in poverty and more and more income inequality concerns me. Need a living wage.

94 2018-02-28 23:39:31 Bump stocks are a worthless accessory, private sales will not be affected
Remember this is a election year for Republicans, even Bernie once supported the #2A, Everyone in America should want a Second amendment to be preserved, even if you chose not to own a gun.

98 2018-02-28 23:38:37 @LouDobbs If you saw the gun safety discussion with Trump then you'd think it was Obama. He seems against the NRA & wants executive order to ban bump stocks. His His presidency is unraveling - first the DACA amnesty & now anti-gun orders!
99 2018-02-28 23:37:56 I really need to start putting myself first
100 2018-02-28 23:37:40 So...who's doing that, FBI? 
The FBI manufactured evidence against a duly elected president.
They told us in Vegas that a 64+ yr old man w/no training, sprayed over 1100 rounds using bump stocks, and two separate guns, 17-19ft apart, and managed to kill 58-59 people?
Bullshit.

116 2018-02-28 23:33:55 He should stick with stocks.
117 2018-02-28 23:33:17 He asks why wasn't anything done before? Then he says, I can get rid of bump stocks now with executive order, don't worry about it.  It's been 4 months since LV mass shooting. Nothing was done before for the same reason he didn't get rid of bump stocks since Oct-1....the NRA

119 2018-02-28 23:32:47 OTC is cleaning up thr act I know its tough, especially if u r  in a stock that gets suspended for putting out PRs w/o Fins being up 2 date. This is a transitional period 4 us, but in long run, we will have more viable stocks to make $. We need to look at this as a good thing
120 2018-02-28 23:32:32 This is anti 2a
1) Exec order to ban bump stocks instead of legislation
2) Seizure of guns from "mentally ill" first with "due process later." Civil asset forfeiture for guns. 
3) Exclude national conceal carry from "comprehensive" bill
4) Raise age to own rifles from 18 to 21.
121 2018-02-28 23:32:18 WA just banned bump stocks. #AssaultWeaponsBan is coming soon here, mark my words.
122 2018-02-28 23:32:09 It’s called being on the same page
123 2018-02-28 23:32:03 And, unfortunately you can create the same effect withba rubber band. Need to ban those too. I dont agree with the use of bump stocks.
124 2018-02-28 23:31:43 They're right. Today's proposals were window-dressing. Assault weapons, semi-automatics, bump stocks, high capacity magazines all need to be banned. Period.
125 2018-02-28 23:31:07 The Dow has fallen for 2 days in a row, dropping 2.6%. The run last extended to 3 days on 25 September 2017, 108 trading days ago (when the run lasted for 4 days). This week has seen the biggest fall in the Dow on a Wednesday in the 41 weeks since 17 May 2017 #stocks
126 2018-02-28 23:31:02 He can't ban the GUN, but, he can't ban bump stocks!
127 2018-02-28 23:30:55 But you pay 5.99 and then you eventually start murdering stocks

That's contracted killing, i.e. assassination
128 2018-02-28 23:30:43 If you're not in stocks. You missed out on #nvax and will continue missing out on free money.
129 2018-02-28 23:30:10 Banning Bump Stocks is bull schiff!!
130 2018-02-28 23:30:10 youre not being punished? you can still purchase a gun? if you have problems w more extensive back ground searches, mental illness examinations, & the inability to purchase bump stocks& high capacity magazines then I truly do not understand.  it’s not about taking away guns.
131 2018-02-28 23:30:10 Not once was banning assault weapons was mentioned, just bump stocks. lots of mention of the mentally-ill and criminals.. video games, movies. Nothing bout the real issues. all talk.
132 2018-02-28 23:29:57 I've been avoiding the smallest tech stocks lately - but $RBO truly looking the goods here.
133 2018-02-28 23:29:54 Other than the AP pics, not seeing any context on the photos. Do they literally worship guns? Have to admit have never heard of this before. But then I’m a gun guy and had never heard of bump stocks before LV.
134 2018-02-28 23:29:12 That would depend on your definition of index. If it’s a collection of stocks then no; if it’s a benchmark which managers are measured against yes.
135 2018-02-28 23:28:24 You executive order on bump stocks can be gotten rid of just like you have done to Obama and you won't do anything about gun control, you will back down just like you always do. NRA owns you!!!@realDonaldTrump
136 2018-02-28 23:27:54 gun idiots are such inconceivable fools. the same people who want to form militias of pensioners with bump stocks in case there's opportunity to rebel against the most powerful armed force to ever exist are also the people who revere said armed force, make up your mind
137 2018-02-28 23:27:48 We’ll see. I would take Boss Hoggs advice and start dumping these stocks.
138 2018-02-28 23:27:11 highly unpopular opinion but I don’t think a selective ban on assault rifles, bump stocks, or raising the age of buying a gun to 21 is going to do jack shit to reduce gun violence
139 2018-02-28 23:27:07 wow that's what up man yeah i have been winning in in DFS a lot lately but we all know it can be up and down i need to expand making money to stocks and bitcoins thanks for the info man.
140 2018-02-28 23:25:51 Well he's calling for Banning bump stocks raising the legal age to 21 which I don't agree with that's why I'm here and having someone trained with a concealed weapons on campus
141 2018-02-28 23:25:40 $SHIP the thing about shippers stocks is they go up same speed the go down, just like an ocean wave. So I’m bullishbearish all the way 
142 2018-02-28 23:25:27 Lyin’ Ted, It’s disturbing to live in Texas and have an @NRA owned puppet like @tedcruz as our senator. You value bump stocks and assault weapons more than Texan lives. You work for the #NRABloodMoney and not Texas. Sad!
143 2018-02-28 23:25:10 Exactly.  Let teachers teach.  Outlaw assault weapons, no private purchases or gun shows, improve background checks, raise age restriction. Ban bolt stocks?
144 2018-02-28 23:24:46 Bump stocks just make ammo manufacturers richer I would much  rather put a well placed sot in from a distance than try to eliminate the whole target.
145 2018-02-28 23:24:42 @SenToomey you represent PA, not the #NRA. Either get onboard with the majority's desire for stricter #GunLaws, including outlawing #AssaultWeapons and bump stocks, or find yourself out of office after your current term expires!
146 2018-02-28 23:24:38 Hi Graccie It's been a long journey & a great stock for me so I wish all AVZ holders the very best. Typically I don't comment on my reasons because I do not want to sound negative. I try to restrict myself to 5 stocks & just wanted to move back to that fundamental. so 1 had to go
147 2018-02-28 23:23:35 ohhh, i was just talking about the recent ban on bump stocks soo
148 2018-02-28 23:23:26 This is an attempt to deceive the unwashed and breed class envy.  If you look at who owns these stocks, 60% or more are owned by institutional investors like YOUR Union pension fund, YOUR 401K funds, YOU companys pension fund, etc This Democrat deception must end.
149 2018-02-28 23:23:25 No, I don’t think so. Trumps bs about banning bump stocks is what this is all about. It has nothing to do with my political affiliation. Turning semi into automatic weapons is bs. Like I said there is no need for assault rifles or any semi to be turned into an automatic weapon.
150 2018-02-28 23:23:25 Maybe Trump is long on gun stocks 
151 2018-02-28 23:23:12 SO SO SO excited that @Stash has single stocks. I’ve been waiting to own stock in @WaltDisneyCo  #Womenwhoinvest

153 2018-02-28 23:22:51 Please don’t cave. Insist on a BAN OF ASSAULT/AUTOMATIC WEAPONS AND BUMP STOCKS!
154 2018-02-28 23:22:43 Armchair quarterbacks  knee-jerk to Trumps NEGOTIATION SKILLS! “Art Of The Deal”-in negotiation phase, press attempts to split the base. I don’t like how he said CCW Reciprocity won’t pass, but that’s not up to him. I prefer he doesn’t ban inaccurate novelty range-toy bump stocks
155 2018-02-28 23:22:30 The NRA gets big money from firearms makers, not the small companies that make bump stocks. They made a call for "additional regulations" - not a ban - after the Vegas mass shooting that resulted in over 900 dead and wounded. It was an attempt to appear reasonable.
156 2018-02-28 23:22:22 Would love to learn how to buy and sell stocks.
157 2018-02-28 23:22:02 Bump stocks are effectively machine guns.
158 2018-02-28 23:21:53 Katie, love ya, but the issue is not the mechanism. It’s the mayhem you can cause with the rate of fire. I’m pro 2A but if you support the automatic weapons ban, to support keeping bump stocks legal is nonsensical.
159 2018-02-28 23:21:29 Very good point. I happen to be a Bill of Rights purist. That said, incumbent party usually takes a hit in midterms. The DNC is determined to brand GoP kid killer enablers. Bump stocks & some more hoops to jump through is an easy give to keep far left out of power. It sucks.
160 2018-02-28 23:21:23 We’ve seen this before. A bipartisan meeting  for the press, tell us how he’s banning bump stocks (he’s been ‘doing’ that for weeks), tell the bipartisan team to put something together (suggesting his ideas as the best)

Then when plan is presented he rejects it & blames Dems
161 2018-02-28 23:21:21 Stocks keep falling & their only customers will be people they give a 26% discount to. Great for business. I would stand by my controversial bff too.
162 2018-02-28 23:21:04 let’s just buy united inc. ‘s stocks and force them to listen :D pfft

172 2018-02-28 23:20:37 If @realDonaldTrump was serious about banning bump stocks he would have already done it. He keeps saying it’s no problem he can do it but has yet to do it. A leader would have already done it. #everyactionhelps

185 2018-02-28 23:16:43 Bump stocks allow an ar-15 type weapon to simulate automatic fire and should be illegal as are all automatic weapons in America.
186 2018-02-28 23:16:20 He won’t do the age thing  cause of the military   He will do the bump stocks  cause that’s a done deal .

We are talking about easily making semi automatic rifles into automatic weapons, with use of the bump stocks. It’s could not be banned by Obama because it did not meet the conditions of changing the trigger.
194 2018-02-28 23:14:42 Under Obama gun stocks always went up when there was a scare that guns would be banned.

This feels like they're trying to stoke sales.
195 2018-02-28 23:14:36 I’m not the far left you wanker. And I’m a gun owner, one who values human life over bump stocks and assault weapons. And I loath the @NRA that’s why I cancelled my membership years ago
196 2018-02-28 23:14:28 I think is is all theater, tbh, and nothing much will happen, re: guns. Maybe a bump stocks ban, and perhaps a raising of the age to 21 for rifle purchases, but even that is unlikely. In other words, I wouldn't get too upset just yet. This Congress can't get anything done, IMHO
197 2018-02-28 23:13:30 Obama approved Bump stocks for sale after the NRA said it should be stopped. I can't figure out why Dems do not want Police in schools? They are used to protect events, banks, courts everything except schools? Wouldn't it increase rapport  with the kids? Why are they so negative?
198 2018-02-28 23:13:27 Sure, we can ban assault rifles and bump stocks and hi cap magazines, but what’s to stop some sicko from dumping a box of knives off his Mandalay Bay hotel room balcony?
199 2018-02-28 23:13:09 Banning Bump stocks is simply a distraction. Bump stocks not used in most mass shootings. Ban bump stocks and allow semi automatics, nuts.
200 2018-02-28 23:12:48 Trump is a liar he is stalling in hopes all this will pass. Also to address bump stocks with executive order could end up in years of legal battles trump & the NRA know that. He is setting congress up on raising the age requirement on AR 15 congress won’t do it.
201 2018-02-28 23:12:45 I’ll say this. I’m okay getting rid of bump stocks, any magazine over 30 rounds, even an age limit or two tiered background check.
202 2018-02-28 23:12:34 I don’t think that’s accurate. 
There would be a solid increase in gun sales and ammo sales and ammo cabinets in sporting good stores would be empty all across the nation. Stocks in gun companies would triple.
Just like when BHO took office.
203 2018-02-28 23:12:12 This was actually lovely to watch As a Democrat I thought wow what great ideas and you were for them all ban bump stocks raise age to 21 You said don’t be afraid of the NRA Hope this guy is still here tomorrow and for the same things
204 2018-02-28 23:12:02 because the students of parkland have spoken out and said enough is enough. why? because within the first 2 months of 2018 there have been near 20 school shootings/attempted school shootings. bump stocks were a topic discussed then as they are now.

210 2018-02-28 23:11:25 A mandatory one-time gun class yes
Universal background checks yes
Semi-automatics yes
Bump stocks no. automatic weapons are illegal and all devices that turn guns into automatics should be
211 2018-02-28 23:10:31 From a buddy in Maine (formerly from MA):
Howie Carr just reported that Massachusetts sent out 400,000 letters 2 weeks ago demanding that gun owners turn in (to police) their bump stocks & trigger cranks.
So far, they've received 4.

212 2018-02-28 23:10:17 Another garbage week of stocks. #VoteThemOut #savetheeconomy #money
213 2018-02-28 23:10:03 So far POTUS in favor of : 
1. Banning bump stocks (EO)
2. Raise buying age.
3. Tighter background checks for private gun sales (Manchin bill)
4. No to concealed carry reciprocity in current bill. Maybe later.
5. Accuses GOP of being afraid of the NRA.
214 2018-02-28 23:09:52 Irrational people & criminals do not care about the law. Gun free zones were a touchy, feel good policy that accomplished nothing with regard to America's gun violence problem. Banning bump stocks will also be meaningless. DC needs to stop attacking the rights of legal gun owners

217 2018-02-28 23:09:18 What happened to bump stocks?
218 2018-02-28 23:09:11 I definitely need to go back to school! This girls talking to me about how she always investing money in stocks and making all this money  back.

220 2018-02-28 23:08:15 Fun part's going to be when Gorsuch writes the majority opinion that Trump's executive order banning bump stocks violates the 1934 National Firearms Act (why the ATF hasn't already banned them).

222 2018-02-28 23:07:38 So let’s have them do the right thing now ! I was literally just at a legislative hearing in Md where the NRA opposed limiting bump stocks for the only reason that they “oppose any regulation of firearms or accessories”
223 2018-02-28 23:07:24 If your bullish on lithium why not grab some Albemarle in-the-money options and call it a day, they will return way more then venture penny stocks
224 2018-02-28 23:07:21 Not to pick on the middle class, but if the middle class started buying stocks earlier, they'd be richer.  Homes/Cars/Campers don't compound.  Stocks do.  That's why the Richest people own stocks.  They make money.  'Stuff' doesn't.
225 2018-02-28 23:06:43 If Trump pushes to ban bump stocks, raise the age for buying an assault weapon, or even banning assault weapons, what will congressional Republicans do? Will they follow him or the NRA? Who holds more power over them? This could get interesting!
226 2018-02-28 23:06:42 @realDonaldTrump
 It doesNOT matter what YOU “feel” An overwhelming majority of American people want Fed. Gun Control. 
@POTUS, JohnCornyn: the public is demanding   assault weapon ban, gun registration, background checks on all gun sales, limit ammunition amt+a bump stocks ban.

239 2018-02-28 23:03:15 Today we talked about the cost of #stocks for all of these #media platforms (@Facebook, @Twitter, etc.) that hold us hostage! Y'all can Netflix and Chill while Netflix traded today at $291.38 a share. @netflix isn't chillin'! Netflix is hustling! 
#socialmedia
240 2018-02-28 23:02:36 it's about placing barriers.  most people don't own 3d printers, so banning bump stocks would dramatically reduce many people's access to such devices.  time and again firearm restrictions have lowered instances of mass shootings.  love ya vids, have a good day.
241 2018-02-28 23:02:32 Bump stocks make the gun fire faster after training.  They don't automagically work.  They require training and if someone is willing to train with a bump stock, they are willing to train with a shoelace or without any extra equipment for the same result.
242 2018-02-28 23:02:12 "Oh no. Trumps gonna ban bump stocks", said no one who understands what a spring is and how it works.
243 2018-02-28 23:01:54 Amazon stocks closed Up today. Are we boycotting?
244 2018-02-28 23:01:40 He's not a CEO.  crypto currencies don't and shouldn't have CEOs.  he just created the coin.  people treat such crypto figureheads as CEOs and coins as stocks which they most certainly are not.
245 2018-02-28 23:01:17 Ban assault weapons. Ban high capacity magazines. Ban bump stocks. Full background checks. Long wait periods. Oh....and a federal buy back program. Ready? #NeverAgain
246 2018-02-28 23:00:32 He might do bump stocks, but you won’t hear him harangue Congress to pass a bill.
247 2018-02-28 23:00:25 Shall not be infringed simple really. Another really good 1 for U where in the 2nd or any amendment does it specify the type of weapon. NEWS FLASH it doesn’t.WELL ARMED MILITIA @realDonaldTrump @POTUS your statement of I’m gonna get rid of the bump stocks sounds like a dictator
248 2018-02-28 23:00:12 Many investors forgot stocks don’t always go in one direction.
249 2018-02-28 22:59:15 Whoever said $tvog is a p & d must be really dumb!
250 2018-02-28 22:58:57 He is telling them to take bump stocks out of any legislation- then he’ll back away from signing any EO to keep NRA on his side. Don’t trust anything he says. WH tells white lies. He must tell whoppers
251 2018-02-28 22:58:21 If holder of stocks are underwater more than 50% then it also become Do Nothing Market for them.
252 2018-02-28 22:57:27 Aren’t bump stocks still legal?
253 2018-02-28 22:57:06 I found that my portfolio is now dominated by blockchain stocks....  $sx $play $ect
254 2018-02-28 22:56:36 If you’re not 4 the immediate halt of the mfg/sale of AR-15 semi-auto assault rifles (& their ilk), bump stocks, & high cap mags and 4 raising the age limit to 21 for all gun purchases with a detailed and intensive background check, then you live in a world I don’t want to be in.
255 2018-02-28 22:56:36 @jimcramer so the lithium stocks are getting hammered. I’m talking mainly about ALB. Any insight would be greatly appreciated! I thought fundamentals look good but has slightly less cash than expected. My cost basis is hurting...
256 2018-02-28 22:56:34 L'EPRUS c'est la Réserve Sanitaire, on ne les voit pas trop à la télé parce qu'ils ne sont pas fluos mais ils bossent. Et c'est aussi les stocks pharmaceutiques stratégiques, en cas de pandémie, de biohazard massif de guerre et tout un tas de joyeusetés comme ça
257 2018-02-28 22:56:23 An AR-15 is literally a tactical ("scary") looking hunting rifle. There are thousands of models that work the same.  You'd have to ban them all and that's NOT gonna happen. We need to tackle bump stocks, hi cap mags and our fucked up society before any real reform can happen.
258 2018-02-28 22:56:21 I hope your right.....this stinks to high heaven. Give the democrats the opening to attack the NRA "sometimes you gotta fight them" then EO's on bump stocks....I just don't get it. Couldn't think of a better way to piss the base off then this.
259 2018-02-28 22:56:04 No. bump stocks are a stupid novelty item they make the gun far less accurate.
260 2018-02-28 22:56:02 immediately stop the sale of bump stocks, deeper back ground checks, mental health professionals in schools, arm schools, remove gun free zones in school districts....keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill.
261 2018-02-28 22:56:02 It's part of the solution. Banning high capacity magazines & bump stocks would help. Increasing access to mental health care & making sure mental health care is covered by insurance would help. People with a history of domestic violence shouldn't own a gun. Lots we can do!
262 2018-02-28 22:55:57 Trump could sign that executive order outlawing bump stocks he said he could do. That would show his true willingness and risk tolerance re NRA.
263 2018-02-28 22:55:55 The NRA, dedicated to keeping it easy for any nutjob to buy a tricked out rifle, high capacity magazine, bump stocks and tons of ammo.... because... evidently because they like seeing the death toll rise.
264 2018-02-28 22:55:49 That's splendid news @Stocksjd63!!! Horaaaaaaaaa! Yesss! Awesome for you! Although something is missing, hmmm....?#TheEditingButton. Lol, other than that Twitter is non-stop flawless. Good day to you Mr. Stocks! I Hope you have a marvelous day. 
265 2018-02-28 22:55:18 Bump stocks increase the speed at which bullets are fired and cause the entire weapon to move back and forth in the shooter’s grip. While the devices are said to convert semiautomatic weapons into fully automatic ones, they also decrease accuracy and are less safe, say experts
266 2018-02-28 22:55:01 Someone needs to tell him that Trump just threatened to use an executive order to ban bump stocks, said the age limit should be raised to buy guns, said guns should be taken away from some people, and told Republicans to stop being afraid of the NRA.

270 2018-02-28 22:52:26 Trump should shove his bump stocks in his fart box
271 2018-02-28 22:52:09 I missed that part. Bump stocks? Cmon even you were shocked when you saw Vegas.
272 2018-02-28 22:51:53 I need more stocks to invest in
273 2018-02-28 22:51:50 Don’t forget, they said they’ll continue not selling bump stocks. So we can celebrate the fact that that policy has not changed whatsoever....

Super Late Models, ILMS, Pure Stocks, and Hornets

(Non-points night for ALL classes)
275 2018-02-28 22:51:35 Because gun weren’t their biggest selling item for a long time, just mainly using it for PR seeing as their stocks just shot up substantially
276 2018-02-28 22:51:20 I did. Get rid of AR-15s. Barring that, comprehensive background checks, close the gun show loophole, ban bump stocks and high capacity clips, and increase mental health coverage and funding.
277 2018-02-28 22:50:32 He probably means stocks and shares in speed bumps
278 2018-02-28 22:50:26 @NRA is this "your guy", the one you laudered to all who would listen, @realDonaldTrump just said yes to stronger background checks, raise gun ownership to 21, he'll get rid of bump stocks, and take them (guns) away if there's even a sign that that person is an issue.
279 2018-02-28 22:50:18 @realDonaldTrump Congratulations, I just read that you will ban bump stocks by executive order.   A wise, smart move, well done!   Please do the same for assault weapons & increase the age to buy weaponry as the majority of the country would like.   Thank you.
280 2018-02-28 22:50:16 You better start doing something pro gun pro @NRA super fast. I’ve been with you from jump street, but what I read today on Drudge about taking guns was not good. First bump stocks,
Now this? Your worrying me President Trump...
281 2018-02-28 22:49:56 Now, if you truly manage to get a bipartisan bill done that is strong on background checks, adapts 18-21, is strong on the mentally ill and allows for research and data and use your executive powers to ban bump stocks, your approval ratings with me are gonna go up. Way up.
282 2018-02-28 22:48:31 Some people are not mentally or emotionally fit to own stocks
283 2018-02-28 22:48:26 That’s a good start, banning bump stocks by EO.  Now ban AR-15s. They have no use in the general public, other than mass murder. That would take REAL courage.
284 2018-02-28 22:48:20 Except wall street firms keep trashing stocks, scamming investors/IRAs continuously. Started 3 quarters ago when good earnings/forecasts were met with mass selling/preshorting by none other than the rats of 2008, remember them?!!
285 2018-02-28 22:48:04 Complicated. Subsequent moves are part of initial decision. How well things are going w/ other stocks influences risk appetite. I miss out on info when I lack time, like recently.
286 2018-02-28 22:47:59 Arming teachers with handguns won’t help against a crazy shooter with AR-15 + bump stocks.
287 2018-02-28 22:47:51 His words today were more baffling than ever! Very NRA critical, pro-gun control, thinks he can ban bump stocks w EO? He'll get chewed on tonight and tomorrow am will be a backpedaling tweetstorm! Minus a script, he contradicts himself, has no clue what he infers.
288 2018-02-28 22:47:37 Hey @Landm_Marius what do you think about the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell? Do you think there's a chance he could somehow back step and rally stocks tomorrow?
289 2018-02-28 22:47:31 He will then spend the evening talking to the people who are really President and change every single one of these positions except possibly the Bump Stocks so he can claim victory and still pretend play at President.
290 2018-02-28 22:47:27 Yes. I read @KillerMike talk about guns and it changed my opinion. I think people should be able to defend their home/families/communities and themselves. Still think military grade assault weapons, bump stocks, etc should be illegal tho.

Okayyyy 
295 2018-02-28 22:44:44 Trump played them like a violin. Said he was doing bump stocks so they can't use it. Now what? another DACA?
296 2018-02-28 22:43:59 Today, Illinois went from thoughts and prayers to action.

New license requirements for gun dealers 
Longer waiting period for gun purchases 
Raise the age to 21 for gun purchases 
Ban bump stocks and trigger cranks 
#EndGunViolence
297 2018-02-28 22:43:38 I'm going to finally ask a question I've been wondering for most of my adult life: what are stocks?
298 2018-02-28 22:43:07 Yet there stocks rose today.
299 2018-02-28 22:42:59 Yup. Just like the meeting today on guns. Trump took bump stocks off the table. He's doing it. So now what is congress going to do? another DACA?
300 2018-02-28 22:42:28 what are you talking about? The Democrats proposed a bill that banned the sale of bump stocks and specific types of assult rifles
301 2018-02-28 22:42:02 Should ETNs that act like derivatives be treated like derivatives or like stocks and ETFs?  Good discussion by an expert in the space.
302 2018-02-28 22:42:02 "I'll believe in what I see & not in what I believe." Credit Dave Landry   This quote was taped to my monitor for about 15 years. Saved me. Let the market tell you what to do. #stocks #investing
303 2018-02-28 22:41:59 There is no law about bump stocks one way or another, dear, it is something new .... check facts so you don't look so foolish next time
304 2018-02-28 22:41:31 #GunReformNow require background checks on every gun sale period, buyers must be 21 or older, no bump stocks, no assault weapons
305 2018-02-28 22:41:19 It seems to be difficult to get this range at the usual retailers though. Who stocks them at the moment?
I'd love to give them a go.
306 2018-02-28 22:40:48 I don’t think anybody should buy bum stocks.  Agree? @jimcramer
307 2018-02-28 22:40:47 @realDonaldTrump losing my vote if you ban bump stocks
308 2018-02-28 22:40:39 @realDonaldTrump if you raise age limit or ban bump stocks what are you solving? NOTHING...I voted for you to counteract the Democrat agenda, not implement it. Talk about 2020, not looking good for you right now, wise up
309 2018-02-28 22:40:26 So the NRA gave you permission to ok the ban on bump stocks. Wow what did you give them since they already don't pay taxes must have been big.
310 2018-02-28 22:40:08 Invested in @DigitalXLtd Looks like a promising #blockchain #crypto stock. @Fidelity #stocks #cryptocurrency
311 2018-02-28 22:39:46 He’s not going to ban any guns. But he is going to strengthen background checks and ban bump stocks.
312 2018-02-28 22:39:43 How about their current support for the Fix NICS bill that is meant to make background checks more effective, thus making it harder to get guns. They've been supporting it since Nov. of 2017. That qualify? How about their support for more regulations on bump stocks? Those coount?
313 2018-02-28 22:39:30 A #brexitshambles conundrum. The fishing industry. They want to take back control to fish wharever they want, even if  they overfish and the stocks run out. But they sell most of what they catch to the EU. So, loads more fish caught, but no one to sell it to!
314 2018-02-28 22:39:28 Damn @verotruesocial is getting popular, where the stocks att
315 2018-02-28 22:39:12 I'm big on rules. Why? Used to periodically teach outdoor survival skills. Your life may depend on following rules. Yup. I'm big on rules. #stocks #investing

317 2018-02-28 22:38:49 I'm curious.....anybody reading/hearing anything from the law enforcement community regarding their feelings about banning assault weapons/extended clips/bump stocks and raising the purchase age to 21?  Seems a little quiet out there.....
318 2018-02-28 22:38:46 When stocks are about to go down and most low to anti-correlated assets are in negative territory, this is called a mess. Diversified investors in worst position in many years. $SPY
319 2018-02-28 22:38:42 I appreciate that they are not going to be selling bump stocks. That is great but they have only sold assult rifles in smaller stores they own that most people do not know they own. This is mainly a push for acceptance by the general public.
320 2018-02-28 22:38:42 The reality is that a lot of ppl are never going to give up their guns. Even if there are a million shootings. Which is sad. This is why some middle ground has to be made. Such as highering the age of which to buy a gun, reducing the amount of bump stocks bought, (1/2)
321 2018-02-28 22:38:35 It's magazine capacity, not the shape or color of the rifle. Address mag capacity, age to purchase, and rate of fire (bump stocks) and youd put a dent in a shooters ability to cause carnage. 25+ round mags of high velocity .223 long gun ammo is just not needed for legit purposes.
322 2018-02-28 22:38:31 So when can we expect the EO banning gun stocks. You know, the one you should have signed after the Vegas shootings. Get it written, get it signed. Don't keep promising it will be "soon".
323 2018-02-28 22:37:53 Get a group of teachers together and ask them if they want armed teachers in their school.   ASK THE EDUCATORS!   Ban assault weapons & ban bump stocks.  The @NRA owns and runs our government.
324 2018-02-28 22:37:30 Gotcha. I use E-Trade. Haven't paid anyone to buy OTC stocks before.
325 2018-02-28 22:37:19 Stocks were.
326 2018-02-28 22:37:07 Bump stocks and other accessories you can stop. No gun bans.
327 2018-02-28 22:37:03 Trump will get rid of bump stocks, we might see a rise in age to purchase.  This is a bandaid at best.  We must remove assault weapons  & high capacity mags.  If we protect schools nuts will go to movie theaters,churches or the strip in las vegas.  We demand 100% protection.
328 2018-02-28 22:36:55 @HouseDemocrats @HouseGOP @SenateDems @SenateGOP @realDonaldTrump @PRyan @SenateMajLdr Universal healthcare to provide adequate mental health care for ALL, ban high velocity assault weapons & bump stocks, anti-bullying legislation. Don’t turn schools into prisons.
329 2018-02-28 22:36:54 He is taking out bump stocks so congress can't do it. He get's credit. But it's a nit.  Because that's all they would do. So now it's put up or shut up. Just like DACA. Where did that go? The art of the deal.
330 2018-02-28 22:36:30 Reinstate the Federal Assault Weapons ban of 1994 that was 'allowed' to expire in 2004 by an NRA influenced Republican congress!  Outlaw all 'bump stocks' that convert semi-automatic AR-15 style weapons into machine guns (Las Vegas), and outlaw ALL over-sized magazines.
331 2018-02-28 22:36:24 Smart to shift portfolios from stocks to more bonds for now?
332 2018-02-28 22:36:10 If you actually follow through with what you agreed to in the meeting; universal background checks, increasing age to 21, outlawing bump stocks, outlawing assault weapons, improving ability to exchange info, allow law enforcement to take action when they receive warnings-I AGREE!
333 2018-02-28 22:35:30 Oh, I see.  We have to FIND THE CRAZIES, and seize their weapons.

Well, narcing on crazies always goes so well.

How about Trump seizes, compensates and destroys all automatic rifles instead?  THAT would make a difference.  Get those larger than ten mags too.And the bump stocks.
334 2018-02-28 22:34:55 Do not attack bump stocks, they are not the issue
335 2018-02-28 22:34:41 LOL  you think Obama had an EO to ALLOW bump stocks?  ... That is priceless .... you're another stable genius apparently
336 2018-02-28 22:34:36 So Trump's in favor of banning bump stocks. That's tossing a bone.
337 2018-02-28 22:34:34 how would you suggest protecting the students? Getting rid of ARs will reduce their circulation in the market. Also, they are a type of rifle which fires a minimum of 45 rounds a minute (bump stocks), meaning there is a greater potential damage with these compared to others

341 2018-02-28 22:33:52 Just phoned my fidelity rep asked him to note for my mutual fund account no $ to gun or ammo stocks it was easy .by the way fidelity and vanguard are big on investing in gun stocks
342 2018-02-28 22:33:47 Watched some of it...age back ground checks and bump stocks do not do the job or go far enough. History shows the drastic increase in mass shooting after the assault rifle ban was lifted...so you do know what is causing the increase in mass shootings...ban the assault rifles.

349 2018-02-28 22:33:24 An Executive order on bump stocks may not accomplish much because it opens he whole thing up for legal battles.
350 2018-02-28 22:33:07 Shit or get off the pot.  You "yes" everyone at these meetings but nothing is accomplished.  You want to ban bump stocks - DO IT and be done.  It's like everything else you talk about - talk and no action
351 2018-02-28 22:32:38 Rights should never be taken away just because I am not using them at that particular moment.  The question is, is there a good reason to take away those rights?  Why ban bump stocks?
352 2018-02-28 22:32:36 Good start with the bump stocks. Hope they come with a great bill.

359 2018-02-28 22:30:04 The core of my question was wether or not high yield savings, cd’s and money market accounts count as “investing” or if she meant a mix of stocks and bonds. To that end I got an answer.

361 2018-02-28 22:29:46 @TheFive First the Prez sold out the base with his generous DACA amnesty, now he is doing it with his attack on the 2nd amendment & the NRA by issuing an executive order banning bump stocks. Isn't he 'special' ?
362 2018-02-28 22:29:38 @realDonaldTrump you can’t say you suppt the 2nd A& chip away at it! Bump stocks had nothing 2do w’ parkland
363 2018-02-28 22:29:28 And Trump got rid of Bump stocks which is a nit.  But be gets credit 4. He said r u afraid of the NRA?  showing they r if they don't pass anything. Plus he wants schools as hard targets. He said why no bills on this? He played them like a violin.
364 2018-02-28 22:29:20 Bump stocks require one trigger pull as well, but the “bump”, which can be done without the stock, bounces the firing pin and creates burst fire. It’s a silly gimmick, and a waste of expensive ammo.
365 2018-02-28 22:29:16 Lest anyone mistake @RealDonaldTrump braying about banning bump stocks himself, no need for Congress to act, for political courage, please know this is the exact position the @NRA took after Las Vegas. They called for executive action, opposed legislation.
366 2018-02-28 22:27:31 Why do we always compromise with the democrats? Why are those compromises always one sided? This must stop! Pres. Trump said he would sign an executive order to ban bump stocks? How would that have prevented the Parkland tragedy? Why pander to the left? It's a sign of weakness.
367 2018-02-28 22:26:40 Maybe now is a good time to add Dicks to my portfolio . Stocks must be on the upswing now.
368 2018-02-28 22:26:35 Teachers like my wife went into Education to make a difference in students life, not end it.  Focus on serious solutions like Background Checks, Protection Orders, Ban Under 21, Ammo Checks, No Manufacturer Immunity, Ban Assault, HC Mags & Bump Stocks, Research Smart Guns.,,etc
369 2018-02-28 22:26:07 also knives mean that someone has to be in close contact with the victim, reducing the chances of death in masses whereas guns (especially with bump stocks) allow AT LEAST 45 injuries per minute
370 2018-02-28 22:25:54 Dalton Ga shows another reason why teachers should NOT BE ARMED! 
NO GUNS IN SCHOOLS PERIOD!
Ban assault weapons and bump stocks and change age to 21.
371 2018-02-28 22:25:39 Ok, fine with the high capacity mags and the bump stocks... bump stocks aren't "sporting goods" be any stretch of the imagination. But the rifle? It's a lifeless tool. Going to ban semi auto pistols too? Shotguns? Hatchets?
372 2018-02-28 22:25:37 Not selling, not buying either. All depends on your portfolio composition, strategy and horizon. I predict broad sideways channel, no miracles to the upside, but no Armageddon either $RHC #ausbiz #equities #stocks #investing
373 2018-02-28 22:25:34 They banned automatic guns, silencers, ump stocks 
Our 2A is slowly being eroded. 
They won’t have to repeal, amazing how we have these 
Shootings then we get more taken away.
We Won’t get anything back
374 2018-02-28 22:25:32 Nothing like anti gunners to boost the stocks of gun and ammo companies.
375 2018-02-28 22:25:20 @Eirias do I need to set an alarm for the morning? 
376 2018-02-28 22:25:14 They are following $GNC to pump stocks before earnings $DDD
377 2018-02-28 22:25:09 Trump stated today that he will outlaw bump stocks via executive edict. While bump stocks are silly, that isn’t the issue. Please fight the legality of this in court.
378 2018-02-28 22:24:58 Whenever we get a period of poor performance,
most investors conclude something must be fixed. They ask if the markets have changed. But trend following presupposes change.

379 2018-02-28 22:24:45 As a very Pro-2A supporter & gun advocate, I think we ALL can support banning bump stocks. There is no practical need for them.
380 2018-02-28 22:24:19 This thread is full of conservative hypocrites. Should a Christian baker sell to gays? Should Hobby Lobby provide birth control? Any conservative would say "no" but they are all upset about Dick's decision not to sell AR15, or bump stocks? The gun age is ALREADY 21. wtf
381 2018-02-28 22:24:10 Yo también estoy dentro 
382 2018-02-28 22:23:38 They are not selling ar style rifles, mags or bump stocks any longer.
383 2018-02-28 22:23:31 Please introduce a simple bill that bans assault weapons and bump stocks.  Pass it. Then take the next step. Don't put all the wishes in a long bill, it will bog down. #NOMORESHOOTINGS
384 2018-02-28 22:22:58 Gun bill synopsis thus far: 
-HB1273 passed House and Senate; "trailer" to gun dealer licensing...
-that's SB1657 House *JUST* passed
-HB772 Lethal Order of Protection passed by Senate
-HB1465 ban on bump stocks passed by House 
-HB1467 raises age to 21 to own certain guns
385 2018-02-28 22:22:48 Trump says he'll ban bump stocks through executive order
386 2018-02-28 22:22:34 “Do you know how much I have invested in stocks outside of Facebook and Amazon???”
387 2018-02-28 22:22:29 No guns in schools! I watched that round table horrified to hear talk about concealed carry over state lines, banning gun free zones and arming teachers. No no and more no. Ban bump stocks and military type automatic assault rifles, raise the age to 21 & pass UNiv BG checks

389 2018-02-28 22:21:20 An irl MAGA just informed me that he's only coming for bump stocks and the 21 yo restriction is also only for bump stocks bc the tv is locked on Fox and the remote gone apparently
390 2018-02-28 22:21:11 My Amazon package is coming via FedEx tomorrow. I fully plan on adding more to our FedEx investments. Your recommendations seem to sky rocket the stocks.  
391 2018-02-28 22:21:00 It’s odd to me that you still give any credence to his words.  The media gives him credit for showing up.  He’s literally putting on a show. Not willing to do any real work or put effort in.  If he wanted to do an EO on bump stocks he could have.
392 2018-02-28 22:20:57 Dear President Trump good job today!!!! Trump is calling for much stricter background checks, raising the age from 18 to 21 to purchase assault weapons, said he is going to outlaw bump stocks with an executive order, accused Republican lawmakers of being scared of the NRA.
393 2018-02-28 22:20:34 And you do?
394 2018-02-28 22:20:14 We need more protection from white men with assault rifles and bump stocks than we do a wall.

396 2018-02-28 22:20:07 Where do @MarketWatch journalists get this stuff up from? 

Crude oil stocks increased by 3 mmb and the 5-yr avg for this week is 4.3 mmb. Crude stocks increased much LESS than expected. All knowledgeable traders know this.
397 2018-02-28 22:20:05 I didn’t even know what they were under Obama, but now that I do, I would be in favor of banning them no matter. It takes only the slightest manipulation to turn most any semi auto full auto. That’s already illegal. Why should bump stocks be legal?
398 2018-02-28 22:19:08 @TheFive I tweeted this after watching the gun meeting with Senators & Prez Trump & will repeat it here. Through an executive order if Trump is banning bump stocks then a Dem Prez can also ban ammo & guns of his choosing.Trump is on a slippery slope & will lose many in his base
399 2018-02-28 22:19:01 The best part was when Cornyn tried to talk about bump stocks as a negotiation tool and Trump was like oh dont worry about that Im gonna EO that. Essentially taking away the one concession that Republicans were willing to give. This is hilarious and amazing
400 2018-02-28 22:18:46 @realDonaldTrump #BanAssaultWeaponsNow and ban bump Stocks. Now. Executive order now. Strict gun laws now. Executive order. It’s unacceptable to do any less. Save these kids.
401 2018-02-28 22:18:13 Has anyone thought of checking, what with all the #bread chaos going on, what our butter stocks are like? #breadwatch
402 2018-02-28 22:17:55 How do you know my party affiliation?  I know you think bump stocks should be legal, but even Donald Trump disagrees.  Virtually every major law enforcement organization in the U.S. has come out against private ownership of assault weapons. Not a bunch of liberals.
403 2018-02-28 22:17:40 What measures did Republicans block? I want to research it. Obama admin approved the sale of bump stocks in the Vegas shooting. Where was the outrage after Sandy Hook? Where was the outrage over Pulse nightclub? Where????

406 2018-02-28 22:17:06 Ok. What is the benefit of bump stocks. Why would they not already be outlawed?
407 2018-02-28 22:17:03 When you callously say your doing away with bump stocks, do you realize the small businesses that you are putting out of business? Please focus on school safety. Banning guns or stocks does nothing to protect our schools.  @realDonaldTrump
408 2018-02-28 22:16:32 Seeing all this mostly white men whining over a corporation's decision to stop selling assault rifles and bump stocks is gold. May the other sports stores follow suit. Looking at you @Academy and @Cabelas

417 2018-02-28 22:14:21 Remember, Obama had 8 years to pass gun control, and what did he do? He legalized bump stocks.

420 2018-02-28 22:14:02 @realDonaldTrump said today that he supports universal background checks, a higher age limit (to 21) to buy guns, a ban on bump stocks and a ban on assault weapons. Let’s hold him to it!! #NeverAgain #GunReformNow #MakeTrumpKeepHisWord Retweet if you agree.
421 2018-02-28 22:13:44 Trump is just playing politics with the left on this, trying to throw them a bone when they will never be satisfied.  He should know better.  Bump stocks were not used in FL, and the way Vegas was memory holed makes me doubt they were used there.  Enough chipping away at the 2A.
422 2018-02-28 22:13:28 Why are you so paranoid. You’re not worried about mutiny. You’re worried about your $$ tied in gun manu stocks.
423 2018-02-28 22:13:15 Aye what app I need to start investing in stocks?
424 2018-02-28 22:13:13 Let's remind Donald Trump who the NRA is! Call him, write him and tweet him and let him know that we support School safety, hiring armed guards, back ground checks, but are seriously opposed to banning of Guns & gun accessories. Bump stocks are not a problem.
425 2018-02-28 22:12:13 Thank you  you as well!
426 2018-02-28 22:10:51 Scott it is called principles. its why few in watergate cooperated against Nixon and pretty much everyone in Trump's camp flips like a pancake when the heat is applied.  banning bump stocks is pandering. dead armadillos in middle of road weren't shot, they were hit by both sides

429 2018-02-28 22:09:56 When YOU can define all the characteristics of an assault weapon you want to ban; how to successfully describe how to ban bump stocks; not violate HIPAA laws and @ACLU protections of mentally ill; and end lobby groups with which you agree; THEN your opinion is worthy.
430 2018-02-28 22:09:47 See the result about Trump took credits for stocks went up? When it's ready, they'll shit stock market like a hell. They already did a little bit. See NFL, #Patriots lost. Now it's school shootings. They won't let any Trump's mistake go free. So I say powers don't like Trump.
431 2018-02-28 22:09:45 Who can explain "due process" to @realDonaldTrump?

This guy is all over the place
- Spouts @NRA positions 
- Doesn't want to get rid of bump stocks...now he does
- Wants to raise age limits
- Has lunch w/NRA & doesn't want to raise age limits

Now he wants to confiscate guns?!

439 2018-02-28 22:07:01 Saved me cash on my taxes and my stocks have soared since the day he took office.

468 2018-02-28 22:01:40 As for semi-automatics, I think your approach is too broad to have a chance. Start with capacity -- drum magazines, bump stocks and the like -- and there might be room to compromise. Banning all semi-autos takes away a lot of ordinary people's Glocks and that will never happen.

483 2018-02-28 21:58:36 Scaramucci admitted that Trump has always been a globalist. bump stocks give no tactical advantage. banning them is pandering and not common sense. teacher in Dalton Georgia shows that arming teachers is not common sense.
484 2018-02-28 21:58:06 Started with $10 to mess around with some penny stocks last week, and now I have $32. Your boy is about to have some fun with this. 
485 2018-02-28 21:58:01 Current affairs: restore the ban on assault weapons; close all loopholes in background checks, particularly the gun show loophole; restore the Obama-era restrictions on mentally ill owning firearms; ban bump stocks. That's to start. Raising the minimum age of owing gun to 21 too.
486 2018-02-28 21:58:01 They're things that should've been in place already. They're in the same category as bump stocks: measures that those in charge have dragged their feet on to stall now. The biggest issue of all is gun reform... And that's an issue they won't touch bc they're in 2 deep.
487 2018-02-28 21:57:59 @POTUS @realDonaldTrump @GOP Have you even talked to mental health professionals before jumping on this bandwagon? Psychiatrists?  The common denominator in mass shootings is the GUN. Start with common  sense gun laws. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks.
488 2018-02-28 21:57:51 Funny that I entirely quit trading stocks since my crypto entrance.  Stocks seem so stone-age now...is that right?  Seems strange.  Maybe it's the non-stop trading.  Hmm.
489 2018-02-28 21:57:21 CNBC interviewing some retail investors. They aren't talking about anything they want to buy to initiate. They're talking about stocks they want to add too. They've been trained well.
490 2018-02-28 21:57:13 So I just set up my E*TRADE account for my stocks in Apple... and I don’t really know anything about stocks. Someone help me and please teach me how to do duh stocks.
491 2018-02-28 21:56:32 Let's compromise.  You can keep your assault rifle, but high capacity magazines, bump stocks, and any other device that could be use to manipulate the gun to kill more people in a short amount of time, are banned.  Fair? Or not good enough for you?
492 2018-02-28 21:56:23 And just like that their competition stocks just went through the roof!
493 2018-02-28 21:56:23 Got my #stocks going up on a Wednesday
494 2018-02-28 21:55:53 I can’t decide between two punchlines, so yoy can pick your own. 

Something, something...
A) Bear market.
B) Stocks and bondage.
495 2018-02-28 21:55:43 Absolutely not. This is just a sneaky way to sell another 3 Million guns by restricting bump stocks which they were already “investigating”
496 2018-02-28 21:55:38 drumph just finished meeting but you never had a president like me to stand up and do this.. no other president ever done this. he sure is obsessed with himself. bump stocks ban, it's assault weapons that need to go. Not one word about banning them.
497 2018-02-28 21:55:35 Trump says ‘bump stocks’ are gone, may use executive order to ban device. President Trump, I did not vote for you to watch you sit next to the biggest gun grabber, in the country Diane Feinstein and talk about destroying the Second Amendment. At 19 I was carrying an M-1.
498 2018-02-28 21:54:28 Crypto = boundless global markets with zero friction. Fascinating for anyone who has ever traded local stocks.

501 2018-02-28 21:53:31 I can almost swallow @realDonaldTrump s logic on wanting to regulate bump stocks, though I disagree for various reasons. But executive orders? saying to hell with due process? What the hell? Even Obama didn't go that far. Shame on the President.
502 2018-02-28 21:53:28 Fair, and I don’t necessarily disagree with the initial effects, just don’t think stocks will be allowed to stay on the mat long in this uber financialized economy.
503 2018-02-28 21:53:19 What a crazy day! Some great continuations from yesterday $QRTH $GMP.CA $STB, some nice new trades $TA.CA $TAC $BUS.CA $BEW.CA $TSb.CA $PSI.CA and a wild $ZCL $BTC #cryptocurrency fork into Bitcoin Private $BTCP that I'm in very small, mostly out of curiosity. #Stocks #Trading
504 2018-02-28 21:53:18 Stocks are the way to see what happens in real time. Since the announcement time the stock went wild, at close losing 1.37% on a 3.32billion market cap. My not great math says they lost over a billion dollars today
505 2018-02-28 21:53:14 Yes!. MTN to float $5.38B stocks by July 2018 in Nigeria. 
506 2018-02-28 21:53:13 I think we will see those changes soon if POTUS has anything to do with it.  He already has said he will EO the ban on bump stocks.. done deal.  He is pushing HARD to get the universal background check fixed asap.  The only thing to stop him will be politics from both sides.
507 2018-02-28 21:52:50 #ES_F $spx $spy $ES_F #spx I've been constantly tweeting that the stocks will be unable to post an authentic recovery & nobody seems to listen_ so i will just explain that the market will only turn when the bond sell-off is arrested and portfolios rotate to value from growth
508 2018-02-28 21:52:50 Could you please start with common sense. Gun loopholes , bump stocks, large magazines these are an ez fix just get started with less talk more action
509 2018-02-28 21:52:45 was difficult for me to come to grips to but before, I honestly might've just been getting lucky shorting over extended stocks. There is forsure something more to it than that, sometimes you gotta accept defeat and let go to finally achieve what you want, rule #1 don't give up
510 2018-02-28 21:52:37 It's horrible.
They are going to take away your AK-17...
And your bump stocks.

How will you sleep at night?
511 2018-02-28 21:52:15 Hey Donald J. Trump, what part of SHALL NOT BE INFRINGED do you not understand? You swore an oath. If you sign an EO banning bump stocks I will not vote for you in 2020 no matter the opponent
512 2018-02-28 21:52:01 No. People who are sick kill other people, not the guns or the bump stocks, or the bullets.  All are inanimate objects. 

It's men's desires that are evil.
513 2018-02-28 21:52:00 Getting to business. He wants to move on to the not so obvious bump stocks
514 2018-02-28 21:52:00 Absolutely!  Also the reason I was screaming at my tv again — watching people apparently buying today’s storyline. And if he can “take care of” bump stocks so easily, why the hell didn’t he do it 5 months ago?
515 2018-02-28 21:51:50 Next time you free we can look at some stocks to invest in. Let your money make you more money.
516 2018-02-28 21:51:47 Also, him wanting to outlaw bump stocks by executive order is seriously overstepping his bounds. Laws are to be written by Congress.
517 2018-02-28 21:51:33 @realdonaldtrump - 1. What is there to consider? 2. Can you write an executive order to raise the age limit as you are with banning bump stocks?
518 2018-02-28 21:51:28 And what is he proposing to do with the bump stocks already in circulation?
519 2018-02-28 21:51:27 He literally outlined what he meant and 90% of it was things I have been wanting. 

Better background checks

Ban on bump stocks

21 age limit

Mental illness precautions

Assault weapon bans
520 2018-02-28 21:51:16 #DumpTheNRA Shout-out to @DICKS  Sporting Goods for adapting sensible gun safety policies: No more sales of assault rifles; no sales to those less than 21; support of universal background checks; never sell bump stocks! Way to go! Hey, @Walmart - what about you?
521 2018-02-28 21:51:15 My prediction re #Bitcoin price was wrong. I am happy however to see that the second settlement date has passed without stressing the #BTC price. Despite the extreme price volatility (compared to stocks), these datasets will make my model more accurate in the future.
522 2018-02-28 21:50:44 I agree you should be 21 to buy a gun, same as alcohol. no bump stocks, at least 3 days before you can have it but you do have  a right to buy a gun!
523 2018-02-28 21:50:29 NRA has authorized Trump to get rid of bump stocks. They’ll kill any real gun legislation. 
Same old same old until the next school gets shot up.
524 2018-02-28 21:50:11 Damn Brian I'm sorry to hear that with these penny stocks you have to take profits I've had much bigger losses it happens to us all
525 2018-02-28 21:50:10 In the immortal words of Danielle Stocks, "If they're not gonna choose, you make the choice for them." That woman was a goddamn life coach.
526 2018-02-28 21:49:33 Trump says ‘bump stocks’ are gone, may use executive order to ban device. Most criminals don't apply for background checks and they don't follow the Gun Laws you Stupid, Stupid people enact.
527 2018-02-28 21:49:20 .@jimcramer just like: If you're trading in stocks you're trading in drugs! Fool
528 2018-02-28 21:49:18 Maybe if it's the only stock you play. Stocks go up and down, sometimes for superfluous reasons. It happens to all of them. Not just $SRPT
529 2018-02-28 21:49:12 U.S. stocks lower at close of trade; Dow Jones Industrial Average down 1.50%
530 2018-02-28 21:49:02 I can't believe I've depleted our bread stocks by two slices tonight ! Only 9 1/2 loaves to see us through until Saturday.  Thinking of queuing now to re stock ready for Friday #Snowmageddon #2daysmax
531 2018-02-28 21:49:01 Canada stocks lower at close of trade; S&P/TSX Composite down 1.36%
532 2018-02-28 21:48:54 so what will happen in a yr. or two when  the ban on bump stocks and AR-15 doesnt resolve the school shootings? We all know the answer to that. Chip, Chip, Chip away. Now its time for a full on push for Right To Life. Two can play this game.
533 2018-02-28 21:48:49 I sincerely thank you for your support for raising the age to buy an assault rifle and banning bump stocks. You may be the only politician in this country who can stand up to the NRA and get away with it.
534 2018-02-28 21:48:41 Very nice Greek artwork 

I love it 
535 2018-02-28 21:48:33 Don’t worry. Trump is still a deplorable human being and he won’t do anything about firearms except get rid of bump-stocks which the NRA has allowed him to do.
536 2018-02-28 21:48:12 Here is a PS for ya Assault rifle is term label that the left and anti gunners have put on this rifle cause of the look it has style after the military M16 , not an assault rifle untill it is used that way period , and sliding or bump stocks , are not accurate just fun ! P2A
537 2018-02-28 21:47:54 Useless action. Guns don’t kill people. Why don’t you address the MENTAL ILLNESS problem in this generation. Bump stocks? Are you JOKING? Better raise the voting age and military service age to 21 as well then. SWAMP WINS. DEMS WIN.
538 2018-02-28 21:47:53 Look into buying stocks (adidas)...it's going up
539 2018-02-28 21:47:51 Then we're gonna get him into penny stocks and crypto
540 2018-02-28 21:47:47 Not because of bump stocks.  The tools used to commit crimes, do not commit the crime, people do.  Obama may share responsibility in fostering a climate of hate, but not because of bump stocks.
541 2018-02-28 21:47:43 bump stocks suck, get the tax stamp for full auto
remember milk jug at 30, with bump ya going to miss with the first shot and all after,
all it does is burn ammo, not good for even military use

545 2018-02-28 21:47:26 if the market never fell and stocks always went up you wouldn't even really need an investing process or discipline - dart throwing and time would outperform
546 2018-02-28 21:47:06 Be honest ye just want complete control of the global oil stocks. Iraq Syria. Amazing enough when there was a war going on in the Balkans ye were nowhere to be seen... no oil there for ye to commandeer.
547 2018-02-28 21:46:37 to be done. i agree ‘making all guns illegal’ is definitely difficult to achieve, which is why these bills being made are on banning ASSULTstyle weapons, banning bump stocks & regulating the accessibility of who can attain a gun; but these bills are being REJECTED
548 2018-02-28 21:45:57 S&P/TSX index finished the day down 1.46%. Crude oil fell 1,44$ to 61,57$. $VRX falls more then 11%. #stocks #TSX #index #StockMarket #oil #CAD #finance #economy #markets #financialeducation #financialservices #MutualFunds #valeant
549 2018-02-28 21:45:48 It's not about bump stocks or Armilite Rifle Model 15's. Infringement of the 2nd Amendment will not stop the killing, Mr. President. Taking away fteedom from law abiding citizens is not acceptable. And SCREW the NRA, it's not about them. Please wake up sir.
550 2018-02-28 21:45:14 You don’t need bump stocks.
551 2018-02-28 21:45:06 Ok, last week, he banned bump stocks, which was a step, but this week, nothing has been done at all. Just meetings, meetings, and meetings. And twitter, lol, go check his twitter, he looks pretty busy on there lol. And he also wants to arm teachers.
552 2018-02-28 21:44:43 Andrew. Harper never brought it back too balance, He made the balanced budget on the backs of VETS and skimming the reserves of the country plus sold the GM stocks short. Please give the research value not media value.
553 2018-02-28 21:44:19 I agree. Bump stocks, rocket launchers, explosives. Some other weapon mods need to be evaluated. Pistols or rifles are dangerous either way but again, as long as they exist criminals will have them. Law abiding citizens need to outnumber criminals.
554 2018-02-28 21:44:08 Trump is spouting words. Some happen to align with what would be beneficial (banning bump stocks, improving NICS) but it's not calculated. He's just saying whatever comes into his head. "There should be a violence rating on video games! Why hasn't that been done?" No chess.
555 2018-02-28 21:43:53 Tyler, I agree with needing more laws but they need to be enforced. I would like to see attachments that would turn a semi-auto weapon into a fully auto weapon illegal (bump-stocks). However, a semi-auto weapon ... Literally pull the trigger one time and one bullet comes out.
556 2018-02-28 21:43:53 Dont listen to idiots, clearly he only trades mid cap & large cap. Fundementals matter, when shorting stocks that are pumping. Volume is the key, fhk what this idiot is saying
557 2018-02-28 21:43:37 Or Do You Want To Falsely Say Obama "Ok'd" Or "Passed Bump Stocks" One More Time For Shits And Giggles?
558 2018-02-28 21:43:27 @POTUS @QanonPosts  Mister President: Don't rush your EO regarding guns. Banning bump stocks will not prevent killings, nor will banning weapons of any type.  Instead, consider teaching our youth positive values.  They have been demoralized by agents of influence.
559 2018-02-28 21:43:24 There would have been an immigration deal, just like a gun rights bill...IF DEMOCRATS FOLLOWED HIS LEAD!

You know they couldn't do that, but now so does everyone that saw it for themselves.

I hate his comment about "bump stocks" but those are not really covered by the 2nd...
560 2018-02-28 21:43:20 they were talking about a Bipartisan bill, and what part that trump would executive order, (the part about bump stocks)
561 2018-02-28 21:43:09 I was a happy gun owner before 1994, then Congress let's the assult rifle law lapse giving criminals access to more fire power. 2012 Obama increased the same with legalizing bump stocks. Like my guns, hate assult weapons.
562 2018-02-28 21:42:22 He just might be listening to Drake and got excited. 

Back to resource stocks.
563 2018-02-28 21:42:09 Nah. Wayne is smart enough to know that McConnell is calling the shots, while Trump's photo-op today was completely meaningless.

Despite all his talk, we will get nothing more than a ban on bump stocks (which Trump, of course, will tout as a "Great Victory")
564 2018-02-28 21:42:04 Two good things coming out of that meeting.. Trump talked like he had sense, and he's banning bump stocks. The plans to seize are gonna make people go crazy but LOL good.
565 2018-02-28 21:42:00 Let’s name all the things Obama changed about Guns ........ hit me up  if you have anything??? Nothing on bump stocks
566 2018-02-28 21:41:18 He PASSED Bump Stocks?  Next Time You Come Into A Conversation, Google It And Study Up On It, BEFORE You Try To Make A False Claim, Go Read The  National Fire-Arms Act, Why Do You Keep Doing This To Yourself?
567 2018-02-28 21:41:04 Why are public private equity stocks so cheap?
568 2018-02-28 21:40:57 Checking my Fidelity account and making sure my stocks are doing okay makes me feel like a major grown up 
569 2018-02-28 21:40:09 Lol what stocks your investing in, sir?
570 2018-02-28 21:39:59 As long as that doesn't mean you taking gun rights from innocent civilians, you have my support. By the way, nothing wrong with a semi auto deer rifle. No need for bump stocks. They're fun on the range, but can be rented for pleasure shooting.
571 2018-02-28 21:39:43 Pang long term kasi siya and not really like stocks. Minsan ang gains after 3 month mo makikita.
572 2018-02-28 21:39:30 He banned bump stocks, which most big retailers refused to sell anyways. He’s literally doing nothing lol
573 2018-02-28 21:39:17 @NRA Man makes laws, and man can fix laws that hurt man. More so, you know so well the #SecondAmendment doesn't protects any right to own assault weapons, bomb stocks or high capacity magazines!  
#GunReform #GunControl #ParklandShooting #NRA
574 2018-02-28 21:38:53 Because it won't change a thing.  Google belt loops instead of bump stocks.
575 2018-02-28 21:38:53 obama approved bump stocks
576 2018-02-28 21:38:48 I really hope banning bump stocks makes someone feel better who ever wanted one before Las Vegas ?
577 2018-02-28 21:37:50 Relentless "Eiffel Tower" stocks will be balances to downside in selling market. Do have a look If not sure Eiffel Tower effect look up
578 2018-02-28 21:37:26 How can the NRA be tax-exempt? They're involved in politics up to their bump stocks!
579 2018-02-28 21:36:57 Gotta laugh w investing. Countless time on portfolio construction+analysis. This  portfolio only tracks 4 years. Post-expense annualized, a nick behind ttm, bit ahead 3-yr. Since inception- exactly the market. Few ETFs + I could've had a 4th career :)  But labor of love. #stocks
580 2018-02-28 21:36:50 Dick's Sporting Goods just stopped selling assault-style rifles & banned the sale of guns to anyone under 21. The CEO urged lawmakers to ban assault-style, bump stocks, high-capacity mags & raise the age to 21. Also said background checks should be required & loopholes be closed.
581 2018-02-28 21:36:35 Breaking! Trump flipping on #2A !?!  Open to an assault weapons ban with Feinstein.Told Scalise to pull concealed carry reciprocity. Exc. order banning bump stocks. Police confiscation of firearms without due process based on an accusation of mental illness. 21 and over only WTF!
582 2018-02-28 21:36:29 Why does EVERYTHING have to cost SOMETHING?!?! I’m just trying to get a little info on how to invest in some Mary Jane stocks, but they want me to pay for such information

585 2018-02-28 21:35:46 Im not against the idea of age requirements or ban on bump stocks, etc. But tread carefully. Its a slippery slope.
586 2018-02-28 21:35:39 in the sense of increased background checks, raising the age limit to 21, and banning bump stocks. nothing in the effect of a gun ban. I wouldn't trust my own mother with a gun (she's actually a diagnosed schizophrenic)
587 2018-02-28 21:34:51 Cash is king!  No place to hide after today's price action!  Wait for the market & stocks to setup favorable reward to risk opportunities!  #playingitsafe
588 2018-02-28 21:34:47 area was well lit, or at least lit well enough for optics without night vision
I believe was 200-300 but if was 500 even more rounds totally wild
Trust me when I say if fired semi auto he would have killed more
BTW I see no use for bump stocks and am against them as is NRA
589 2018-02-28 21:34:37 Call me crazy...but Trump saying that he wants the guns, the age limit raised, ban on bump stocks.... is he playing chess again?  Or will the Democrats actually support his thoughts, giving him another win? I don't see seethe Dems siding with the president no matter what.
590 2018-02-28 21:34:24 Guns kill people. Assault weapons kill more people.  Bump stocks kill more people faster.  So you're OK with that. Another @NRAShill and member of the #ProGunViolence movement. You're too young to be so mentally polluted by the gun lobby. #WednesdayWisdom #NeverAgain #GunControl
591 2018-02-28 21:34:17 Prez Trump said he didn't support DACA & then after getting elected he offers amnesty with citizenship, he was all for 2nd amendment & still claims to be,  but now issues an executive order to ban bump stocks, asks Congress to change purchase age. Why should I vote Repub 2018 ?

594 2018-02-28 21:33:44 I think that the message is getting lost in the letters... taking away military style assault weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks isn't taking away our right to legally purchase a handgun or long gun. If you pass the background checks then you can still own a gun.
595 2018-02-28 21:33:35 @JerryFalwellJr will tweet how bump stocks are of the devil any minute now...
596 2018-02-28 21:33:34 Personally, I could care less about bump stocks. They can be made on 3D printers, or with a piece of wood and hardware. I don't like them and don't know any sane people that do. Leave other falsely named guns alone.
597 2018-02-28 21:33:19 Bump stocks allow a semi-automatic weapon to fire at a speed closer to an automatic weapon.  I don't think they should be legal and it is an easy win for Trump.
598 2018-02-28 21:32:44 @realDonaldTrump asserted that some republican congressmen were afraid of the NRA, wants to eliminate bump stocks and increase the age of ownership to 21. I don't know who this guy is but I like it.
599 2018-02-28 21:32:28 Despite a concerted effort to recover, US #stocks post their worst February on record, with the #Dow down 1100 points (-5.96%)
600 2018-02-28 21:32:19 President Trump telling the public to look at: 
-age
-bump stocks
-video games
-movies
-mental health
-training teachers
For safety reform seems convoluted. WTH is going on? It is all over the place.

607 2018-02-28 21:30:40 We came into today negative on stocks for several key reasons, and happy to share today's note with those interested, which was sent out at 530am-  Email me info@newtonadvisor.com,
608 2018-02-28 21:30:39 The top five stocks that gained today were $TDX, $BKNG, $EVHC, $AAP, and $M.
609 2018-02-28 21:30:33 Bump Stock ban Is not necessary. We need the laws that we already had to be enforced.  Bump stocks are a gimmick and do not add to the accuracy of the aim of a rifle.  This is just kowtowing to the left and their gun grab mentality. Look at the fact that this man was bullied
610 2018-02-28 21:30:04 By corporations taking 98% of their tax cuts to buy back stocks
611 2018-02-28 21:30:01 If you ban AR’s bump stocks wouldn’t be needed!
612 2018-02-28 21:29:58 The top five most active stocks today were $GE, $BAC, $CMCSA, $CHK, and $AMD.
613 2018-02-28 21:29:37 I'm curious, are you with the President today?  Exec. order to ban bump stocks.  Raise age on all guns to 21.  "Take the guns first, let due process happen later." Not in favor of concealed carry across states. Are you with him on this?
614 2018-02-28 21:29:37 So That Means You Know Who Rick Vasquez Is, And Your Are Starting To Understand, That Obama Was TRYING TO REGULATE THEM, Then Right? You Know There Was No Law, No Bill To Pass Bump Stocks Right?
615 2018-02-28 21:29:31 Stocks likely would be comforted on a bigger yield decline at a time when most investors have gotten VERY bearish on Treasuries with nearly unanimous opinion that yields have to keep rising, and this year could turn out quite similar to last where March marks a peak in yields
616 2018-02-28 21:29:29 Portfolio slipping down a bit lately. Not worried as oil stocks will cone good when second half 17 results announced. £££££
617 2018-02-28 21:29:21 Haven't heard too much from u. Now let's pass laws to ban assault weapons, bump stocks, and clips that hold more than 10 bullets. Also no one under 21 should be able to buy any gun.
618 2018-02-28 21:29:21 stocks traded today 
$ECYT 5.50 - 5.71 (+3.8%) 
$ABIO 0.855 - 0.96 (+12.2%) 
$ECYT 6.00 - 6.06 (+1.0%) 
$SRNE 9.36 - 9.50 (+1.4%)
619 2018-02-28 21:29:12 What about this possible executive order banning bump stocks? I wonder how that's gonna fly?

621 2018-02-28 21:29:01 If you had the big manufacturers make their semi-auto hunting rifles with folding stocks and rails and flag supressers. But the have a 5 shot internal capacity. Gov could buy them at a rate. Knock 50 million off the defense budget for 5 years. Win win.
622 2018-02-28 21:28:51 Are we for bump stocks or against them? Because I don't know anybody who is for them. So can we just ban them now?
623 2018-02-28 21:28:50 The dollar was firm, yet bonds & stocks moved in different directions today as Stocks fell with bond YIELDS which was different than the Algos of late- Will be tough to make too much of bond rally unless 2.82 is violated.. and this sets up for a larger pullback in yields.
624 2018-02-28 21:28:45 Precisely.  Just as one can use their belt loop on their pants to increase fire rate, much like bump stocks do.  So now I suppose they will want to ban pants with belt loops.  

Good shooting BTW.
625 2018-02-28 21:27:56 My thought exactly. There’s already a proposed bill to ban bump stocks. Trump could support the bill and have it handled.

Other option is he’s worried how weak it’ll make him look when he supports the ban and Republicans still refuse to vote it.
626 2018-02-28 21:27:46 NRA’s solution is arm the student and concert goers with bump stocks
627 2018-02-28 21:27:42 I just made my 1st Dick's Sporting Goods store purchases online!  It won't be my last! Thanks for your decision to stop selling assault rifles, high capacity magazines, bump stocks! Your other policy suggestions are welcome too! 
628 2018-02-28 21:27:40 @waynelapierrejr Beware when Prez Trum brags about an executive order to ban Bump stocks. Another Dem Prez can ban ammo & guns he dislikes - this is a slippery slope .

But i will also go big into stocks again after the next market collapse
630 2018-02-28 21:27:12 I'm sure there are many NRA members that don't want these bump stocks around anymore. And then again, many hunters used long guns but not AR-15s

632 2018-02-28 21:26:51 His range was 500 yards, and it was night (2205-2015). I haven't heard anything about him having NVGs. I would think that it was a numbers game. Get the most rounds into the mass of people in whatever time available before they scattered. The bump stocks facilitated that.
633 2018-02-28 21:26:49 Holy sh**balls, @realdonaldTrump just said a bunch of great stuff about gun control! I think he is actually going to ban bump stocks!!! *crowd cheers*. He's leaving it to Congress to get a gun control bill passed.  *wah, wah, wah* 
634 2018-02-28 21:26:08 Aw, damn... Thoughts and Prayers...

But, unfortunately for the gun stocks, I'm an atheist, so dunno how good those "prayers" will do them...
635 2018-02-28 21:26:07 Trump today: 

-opposed to pushing concealed carry

-wants to ban bump stocks by executive order

-wants to increase min. age for purchasing some rifles to 21

-wants to merge "Fix NICS" w/Toomey-Manchin

-wants Congress to create bill "strong" on background checks, mental health
636 2018-02-28 21:26:03 It's a cult founded by the son of Reverend Moon apparently. They put a lot of money into gun companies so this is really just a big move to up the value of their stocks. I am willing to bet there is a prescribed weapon and brand.

645 2018-02-28 21:24:03 Dick's Sporting Goods, after announcing to stop selling assault-style weapons, saw its shares rising, while other gun stocks and the market are down.

646 2018-02-28 21:23:58 @realDonaldTrump  You want mental health issues addressed when it comes to guns, Yet you reversed an Obama regulation keeping those with mental health problems and people on terrorist watch lists from buying guns. Hypocrite. NRA ok'd banning bump stocks. NRA  guns in schools.
647 2018-02-28 21:23:54 $KSHB decent close 4.25 from sub $4 earlier.  Weed stocks overall green today, Kush been tough lately, but I love the risk/reward down here in the low 4s, and nice close in a really bad overall market is encouraging.
648 2018-02-28 21:23:54 So when you became president you started writing executive orders to get rid of Obama's policies immediately didn't even take you a day why is it taking you so long to get rid of bump stocks?
649 2018-02-28 21:23:50 The dramatic drop in stocks was IMO engineered to allow investors to buy in at the low prices. Would be interesting to see if any dumped some of their stocks prior to the downswing.

656 2018-02-28 21:21:53 As a second amendment supporter, I see no need for bump stocks being legal.
657 2018-02-28 21:21:44 Ban bump stocks and the AR15.

662 2018-02-28 21:20:43 The gun market has been in a LONG slide into a slump since November 9 2016. Of course the stocks are down. All those AR-15's selling for $399.95 on February 13, are now $650 and rising.
663 2018-02-28 21:20:28 Canadian stocks just posted their worst monthly loss since December 2015.
664 2018-02-28 21:20:26 Then BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. Yes it is Congress' job to ban them. Yes it is your job ban bump stocks. I am a Veteran. I stood watch with an M-16. NO civilian needs an assault weapon. NO ONE hunts with them unless they are hunting humans. Find your spine and take a stand!!
665 2018-02-28 21:20:20 "Can't" is a big word. I for one don't believe in CB omnipotence. The point is in the late 60's stocks outperformed because real yields fell i.e. they "ran it hot", which is good for EPS  However, before we reached that point in 1966 we had a market crash as yields/rates rose.
666 2018-02-28 21:20:12 I watched. As a fake president pretended to care!

674 2018-02-28 21:18:34 Give me one reason why it’s bad to ban bump stocks
675 2018-02-28 21:18:09 @CNBC It is illegal that you have Jim Cramer causing the pumping and dumping of stocks and hurting others. Shame on CNBC

680 2018-02-28 21:17:35 she talks about budgeting but I still don't really know how to budget so I think mostly saving. Like 401K and that type of stuff. I know she has had stocks and investments in the past as well.
681 2018-02-28 21:17:21 What is ironic about that? Bump stocks are bad because they can result in more people being killed in a mass shooting and they have no legitimate purpose (other than som ppl like to shoot machine gun style) through rapid fire and inaccuracy. That’s why we want to ban them right?
682 2018-02-28 21:17:15 @realDonaldTrump Just watched the school and community safety live stream.  All about tough background checks and banning bump-stocks.  More interested in improving school security  That's where the effort and money should be placed. Criminals do not care about new laws.
683 2018-02-28 21:16:36 Bump Stocks Are A Gimmick; No Serious Shooter Uses Them.
684 2018-02-28 21:16:33 Guess you missed the televised bipartisan meeting at WH to finally make schools safe, ban bump stocks and AR15 ... making history with this type of transparency. Who is Manafort?
685 2018-02-28 21:16:28 I don't normally mention little stocks
686 2018-02-28 21:16:09 Why do people pump shite when they could go and actually just pick undervalued stocks ...no guarantee but at least there's some honour
687 2018-02-28 21:16:07 I was listening to the presidents gathering about solutions to the vilence in schools, personally, I careless about bump stocks, if you want to make age for guns 21 I could probably live with that if you leave young hunters hunting with father's alone but keep it all reasonable.
688 2018-02-28 21:15:58 the Presbyterians are holding their ceremony next week. Bump stocks optional but Jesus required.

690 2018-02-28 21:15:48 I had to turn it off before I started screaming at a bunch of glass & plastic. Ban & remove automatic & semi-automatic ( incl. bump stocks) NOW this other conversation is just about getting votes.
691 2018-02-28 21:15:35 Introduce a simple bill that bans assault weapons and bump stocks.  Just that.  Pass it. If the bill gets too long and/or complicated, no one will be happy and nothing will be done. Take the first step.
692 2018-02-28 21:15:30 Y’all republicans still love Trump now? After basically saying that the age needs to go up for getting certain guns and wants to ban bump stocks
693 2018-02-28 21:15:24 2/magazines and bump stocks. We also invest in mental healthcare on a more proactive level to ensure people get the help they need before they resort to this. We can also add universal background checks nationwide & ban the sale of them to the violently mentally ill. We also
694 2018-02-28 21:15:06 ... until an NRA A-rated senator gets his ear right before decision time and, voila, bump stocks end up being easier to buy in the event that armed teachers need to kill MULTIPLE school shooters.
695 2018-02-28 21:15:06 But their stocks went down since
696 2018-02-28 21:15:06 Trump’s televised “round table discussion” BS! He saw the numbers from elections in Texas going Blue, and HE IS RUNNING SCARED! This is a ruse. He did nothing after the Vegas shooting, and the Congress does nothing on bump stocks. This is gonna go the way of DACA discussions.
697 2018-02-28 21:14:34 I think everyone is getting sick of this kid. Really like Fl will shut down and COs  will dump stocks  because he demands 
698 2018-02-28 21:14:32 @TeamCavuto Neil, who do you really think you are? Are you smart enough to run for president? Can't you have respect for the leadership position OUR President is doing under the most critical people in the MEDIA. Aren't you knowledge in STOCKS and BUSINESS? Do your own business.
699 2018-02-28 21:14:20 Could be, but very few are.  I will pay more in taxes.  (Any individual tax breaks are temporary only.) If you have $ to invest in stocks, you’re golden, but not all can do that.
700 2018-02-28 21:14:16 @realDonaldTrump please get yourself educated enough about firearms that you can correct @SenFeinstein when she claims "weapons of war" are being sold to the American people. Retractable stocks and pistol grips don't make guns more deadly. #2A @NRA
701 2018-02-28 21:13:51 Doesn't know Dick about stocks either
702 2018-02-28 21:13:38 Bump stocks are worthless*
703 2018-02-28 21:13:36 @delaneytar @davidhogg111 Trump just told Congress don't worry about bump stocks.I can take care of it myself. It doesn't have to bein the law.   Then why hasn't he done it already?  He didn't support it after the LasVegas shooting.  Don't trust him
704 2018-02-28 21:13:32 If you're buying Trump's shit on guns you're insane
 
Don (probably): "Look, this time they're really pissed. Again. Anyways, we gotta give them something. Bump stocks. I'll ban bump stocks, promise more, some other shit will happen, they'll forget about it." 

NRA: "I guess..."
705 2018-02-28 21:13:22 Bump stocks are  meaningless. If you have a belt loop you have an automatic weapon
706 2018-02-28 21:13:21 Hey, had anyone heard that Trump is gonna get rid of bump stocks himself? LOL.
707 2018-02-28 21:13:20 @FXS_Stocks_JA Thank you very much for your follow!
708 2018-02-28 21:13:03 EMERALD FRONT stocks pull-back amid troubling geopolitical headlines
709 2018-02-28 21:12:47 Dick's Sporting Goods is stepping up no longer sell assault-style weapons, large magazine or sell to anyone under 21 years of age, nationwide.
The chain has never sold bump-stocks.
710 2018-02-28 21:12:37 I'm pretty sure bump stocks are gonna be made illegal
711 2018-02-28 21:12:36 Stop taking money from the NRA and pass laws to ban all automatic weapons, bump stocks, clips over 10 bullets. No one under 21 should be able to buy a gun. There will be more shootings and killings. All is on congress to do something
712 2018-02-28 21:12:34 You guys are hiding from a lay-up of a bill on bump stocks just like you’ve been cowering on the AUMF for YEARS now. This view is completely accurate.
713 2018-02-28 21:12:32 Yes Trump has done well here & if he is not lying again is pushing for comprehensive gun reform Trump wants universal background checks, age to 21. Ban on bump stocks , ban on assault weapons, identification of mentally ill, no guns for domestic abuse. Youths keep going.
714 2018-02-28 21:12:09 I see eliminating access to AR-15, high capacity magazines and bump stocks as part of the way to prevent gun violence. Seatbelts help reduce injuries in motor vehicle accidents.
715 2018-02-28 21:11:57 Sorry, not necessary
I know what bump stocks do
I know almost every mass shooting was done with those sorts of guns

Those are the facts, and you ignore them

Clearly nobody that you love has died, and you're incapable of empathy, like all rwnj
716 2018-02-28 21:11:28 While that discussion was playing out on live TV at the White House; the Illinois House just banned bump stocks and raised the assault weapon age to 21.
717 2018-02-28 21:11:24 They weren’t. They were selling semi automatic rifles with synthetic stocks. They don’t have the licenses to sell a real assault rifle.
718 2018-02-28 21:11:10 Bump Stocks are for fun.  When you use them, you lose accuracy.  Banning them just signals to the Left to push for more.
719 2018-02-28 21:11:02 Some leader & dealmaker that @realDonaldTrump. Not once during his roundtable on school/community safety did he offer to lead on crafting legislation or corralling votes.  Except claiming he can outlaw bump-stocks w/o Congress. Yet Captain Bone Spurs hasn't done so.
720 2018-02-28 21:10:46 @realDonaldTrump The D. Feinstein Assault weapons bill died because the list defined as assault weapons was ridiculous. It needed to die. Bump stocks was a BATF screw up and should have never been allowed on the market. We still have a 2nd Amendment to live by, I support it.
721 2018-02-28 21:10:26 Smart move, T. Bump stocks aren't protected by the 2nd amendment.
722 2018-02-28 21:10:23 Please explain why stock buybacks in today's markets are anything other than payoffs to stock holders (10% of wealthiest U.S. households own 84% of stocks) and a way to reduce Corp's cost of capital?
723 2018-02-28 21:10:23 @realDonaldTrump Watching your meeting with the Congress members. Please ban bump stocks. Raise the age to own ANY gun, unless you're military, to 21. Ban Assault weapons altogether. They are for military. Help mentally ill people anyway. Only 3 shootings, which is 22%, were...1)
724 2018-02-28 21:10:21 If a Repub president can ban bump stocks with an executive order then the next Dem president can ban ammo & any gun he wants - Prez Trump is clueless of the reckless action he is embarking on.
725 2018-02-28 21:10:20 He said the exact same thing about age limit and bump stocks last week and flipped two days later so I’m not holding my breath
726 2018-02-28 21:10:18 When the smoke clears & the BAM BAM BAM subsides we'll creep out from our hiding places into a safety/security/constitutionality sweet spot where all good guys and teachers have assault rifles, all bad or crazy guys are disarmed and/or dead, and no one alive has any bump stocks
727 2018-02-28 21:10:10 Bump stocks because you can do it? Las Vegas was October! @POTUS
728 2018-02-28 21:10:00 #yields and #stocks down.... 
Bucks the trend
729 2018-02-28 21:09:59 @jimcramer FYI re discourse on Lowes.  Home Depot is builder friendly and stocks to Builder's needs versus Lowes.  There online experience is superior also
730 2018-02-28 21:09:57 When will his supporters realize that he was a business Democrat he change sides multiple times, that is why he was quick in banning bump stocks, he is larping as a Republican
731 2018-02-28 21:09:46 Seriously though he’s just trying to spike gun stocks.. that’s my conspiracy Theory
732 2018-02-28 21:09:41 Stocks end Feb. w/ big selloff.  Dow sinks 380 pts & S&P down 30. Both record worst month in two years
733 2018-02-28 21:09:40 @realDonaldTrump do you have ANY clue as to what you ware talking about.  Your round table with the members of congress sounded like a moron leading it.  Shut up and get out of the way.  We need a BAN on ALL AR sales, bump stocks, and limit the clip capabilities!
734 2018-02-28 21:09:39 Great find gentlemen! How far do you expect this to go? Clinton you mentioned 3-4 stocks with prospects that you're looking at, would you mind sharing?
735 2018-02-28 21:09:37 Trump: “Don’t bother putting bump stocks (ban) in any bill. I’ll take care of that.” WTF? It is 100% true it is not clear that the executive branch through the ATF can do that. I think the consensus leans towards no. So why not take care of it through Congress?
736 2018-02-28 21:09:30 LOL. Really!? Riddle Me This, How Many People Died In Las Vegas, And Who Was President At That Time, And What Did That President Do About Bump Stocks? (The Answer Is Not Obama Or Hillary) What Has He Done About Bump Stocks Yet? Did He Receive $30 Million From The NRA?
737 2018-02-28 21:09:24 Like his bravado?  Where else is NRA going to go? Besides, he and Wayne have compared notes. Everything you hear is rehearsed.  This is our TV star at his best. Months from now?  Nothing sig will happen except bump stocks.
738 2018-02-28 21:09:19 @realDonaldTrump just said he’ll ban bump stocks through executive order. So conservative!
739 2018-02-28 21:09:15 Trump called out republicans for being scared of the NRA and asked them to raise the age limit on weapons. He said don’t worry about bump stocks he will sign an executive order. Wants to go hard on background checks. Think we might finally pass some bipartisan legislation
740 2018-02-28 21:09:09 I am no fan of this President. If he bans bump stocks, raises the minimum age for gun purchase, closes the gun show loophole, and adds universal background checks?  Even I’ll have to admit his Presidency accomplished something.
741 2018-02-28 21:09:08 I'm not. I posted an article earlier somewhere in this thread about gun regulation I support. I also support background checks on private sales and the banning of bump stocks. My concern is giving and inch people taking a mile. Such as the new house bill.
742 2018-02-28 21:09:07 You know what’s not pure shit? Watching my snap stocks go up. #gains
743 2018-02-28 21:08:56 Like you I sat through a presentation at work by someone saying Australia was DESPERATE for more blood stocks. All the Brits (approx 10% of the crowd) were offering to help but of course we were told no. Also a big problem for Aussies who live abroad during that time!
744 2018-02-28 21:08:55 Banning bump-stocks by EO is only a distraction. It takes a statutory law to ban them.
745 2018-02-28 21:08:52 Well said @RepTedDeutch

"I want #Parkland to be the last mass shooting.

Universal background checks
Ban bump stocks 
Ditch the Dickey Amendment
Raise the age to 21

And do it now."

#GunReformNow #TheResistance
746 2018-02-28 21:08:32 Trump holds roundtable with lawmakers and: 

1. Accuses Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) of being "afraid of the NRA"
2. Says: "Take the guns first, go through due process second"
3. Encourages lawmakers to combine various gun bills
4. Will try to ban bump stocks through executive action
747 2018-02-28 21:08:30 They aren't the only show in town.  I see their stocks are going to plummet
748 2018-02-28 21:08:17 Jerk @realDonaldTrump putting on his Big Show. Passing the buck and he won’t sign one dam thing. Just like DACA. If you can ban Bump Stocks Do It Now! What are you waiting for? That is all Crap you know that

752 2018-02-28 21:07:51 @CNNPolitics @realDonaldTrump Says he will do away with bump stocks. What the fuck is he waiting for???
753 2018-02-28 21:07:42 @realDonaldTrump keeps saying he’ll take care of the banning of bump stocks. Why doesn’t he do that right now?  Show us you mean it!
754 2018-02-28 21:07:41 Trump again claims that he's "getting rid" of bump stocks. "We're getting rid of it," he tells lawmakers. "I'll do that myself because I'm able to."
755 2018-02-28 21:07:26 Trump thinks his proposed Executive Order on bump stocks, which will be challenged thru years of litigation, would be better than actual legislation! He has no idea how legislation works. 
756 2018-02-28 21:07:25 also Trump just went ham today. called GOP lawmakers "scared of the NRA" said he supports raising AR age limit. is 100% banning bump stocks. says cops should take guns away from people they think are bad "no matter what. even if its unlawful" what the shit
757 2018-02-28 21:07:23 Mr. President, changing Hollywood nor video games will solve gun violence. Let's START w/ a comprehensive gun bill that addresses loopholes, mental health, bump stocks, raising the age to purchase to 21, assault rifle ban, & comprehensive background checks. To start...
758 2018-02-28 21:07:22 It’s sad that our countries policies are being discussed with giggles and throwing of blame all over. Nothing will get done. Maybe bump stocks, that about it.
759 2018-02-28 21:07:22 Trump just said that he can take care of bump stocks without Congress.  Didn’t he ridicule Obama for using Executive Orders?  #drainthetrump
760 2018-02-28 21:07:19 Le pétrole fragilisé par la hausse des stocks de brut et d'essence
761 2018-02-28 21:07:09 Expanded background checks, raising the age of gun buying to 21, no mentally ill able to buy guns, complete banning of bump stocks
762 2018-02-28 21:07:08 The president, with no fear of the NRA could not bring himself to say assault weapon or AR-15 when discussing Parkland-- instead saying "that type of weapon" but at least  in context of potential age raise to 21. He also said bump stocks gone by EO even tho thought impossible
763 2018-02-28 21:07:06 Damn it Dick's Sporting Goods, you can't stop selling high capacity magazines and bump stocks! I need that stuff for my biathlon rifle. It helps me compensate for my embarrassingly inadequate..... "skiing ability".
764 2018-02-28 21:07:05 “We’re getting rid of it. I’ll do that myself” -Trump on bump stocks

I don’t even know how to digest or reconcile the fact that Trump might be the one to take away bump stocks. Lol
765 2018-02-28 21:07:05 The constitution doesn’t state anything about attachments so you can say goodbye to all your grips sights bipods and stocks. I want guns more than you ever will, you probably can’t shoot for shit.gun control doesn’t mean gun ban, get the stick out of your ass.
766 2018-02-28 21:07:03 All he wants to do is raise the age and ban bump stocks? That's not going to do it!!! OMG if I hear that phrase again I'm going to SCREAM!! A good guy with a gun isn't going to stop a guy with an AR-15!! BAN MILITARY WEAPONS!!
767 2018-02-28 21:07:01 The blame ALWAYS gets pushed off somewhere else...it's absolutely baffling. If that guy hadn't had a load of semi-auto rifles with high cap mags and bump stocks, he doesn't injure/kill ~600 people...fact.
768 2018-02-28 21:06:55 .@realDonaldTrump instructs lawmakers to create a bill that's "strong" on background checks, mental health. Tells them not to worry about bump stocks, he'll do that himself.
769 2018-02-28 21:06:55 Guys I Officially invest in some stocks lol
770 2018-02-28 21:06:49 And than... don’t worry about banning gun stocks... I can do that.  You can remind an executive order .. not so easy with legislation
771 2018-02-28 21:06:43 So how long is he going to say he is going to outlaw bump stocks? If he can do it, then get it done NOW! He acted faster undoing Obama's regulation on mentally ill and guns.
772 2018-02-28 21:06:39 Raising the gun age + more background checks + no bum stocks < No AR’s.  Quit appeasing. Start making a difference. #AssaultWeaponsBan
773 2018-02-28 21:06:34 Wtf?? Der leader is getting rid of bump stocks himself. I hope he does not change his mind tomorrow
774 2018-02-28 21:06:30 Stocks close at session lows ... Dow -386 points.
775 2018-02-28 21:06:30 Trump insisting he will take care of bump stocks. 

Is this a fake move?

If he bans them there will be a court fight lasting a year, 2 years. Does he just want it to end up failing?
776 2018-02-28 21:06:30 "don't worry about bump stocks, don't even put it in the bill, because I'm taking care of it." -Trump

Yeah, right.
777 2018-02-28 21:06:29 Ok Trumps banned bump stocks!! Anyone guess what's next????
778 2018-02-28 21:06:26 To put a pin on this: 
Pres. Trump backed: 
-Merging Fix NICS w/ Toomey-Manchin
-Raising the purchase age for long guns to 21 from 18
-GVRA, but with taking guns before due process
-An exec order to ban bump stocks

Pres. Trump opposed:
-Concealed carry reciprocity (for now)
779 2018-02-28 21:06:25 The way the stock indexes go, is the way Crude Oil goes. Oil & the Dow down sharply. Stay long SPXS bear fund & SCO oil bear fund! Also stay long Cotton with follow-up stops! #Agriculture #Commodities #Stocks #Cotton #ETF
780 2018-02-28 21:06:24 @realDonaldTrump is being a leader for once & telling congress to get something done on gun control. He said get universal background checks. Something on mentally I'll. Bump stocks are gone. He said he wants it really strong on background checks.  

Wow.  The @NRA can't be happy
781 2018-02-28 21:06:23 I think we'll have a few things to talk about at IBD Meetup tonight!  @IBDinvestors #stocks #investing #trading
782 2018-02-28 21:06:12 Trump is talking about raising the age requirement for a gun, background checks, no bump stocks.....everyone in the room is looking confused
783 2018-02-28 21:06:12 Bump stocks should be in the bill. Harder to repeal that way.
784 2018-02-28 21:06:12 I will sign it. I will get rid of Bump Stocks. You will have to be strong. I will sign it. Bull Shit.
785 2018-02-28 21:06:08 Sitting next to Dianne Feinstein, Trump says he wants to get rid of bump stocks, institute age limits, strengthen background checks, take guns without due process. That's something I just typed...
786 2018-02-28 21:06:01 I'm watching POTUS meeting on guns with Senators & he is selling out to Diane Fenstein & other liberals. NRA should not support the nonsense but if they do then I don't need NRA membership. If he can ban bump stocks then he can ban any ammo or other guns he wants.
787 2018-02-28 21:05:50 yeah well i had to carry bump stocks and extra ammo on top of that        in the snow
788 2018-02-28 21:05:47 Does Ryan Murphy own stocks in FOX or something? They just let him throw out new shows every week
789 2018-02-28 21:05:47 Trump to legislators: we re getting rid of bump stocks. Don’t worry about it. I’ll do it myself. #Amen.
790 2018-02-28 21:05:46 Post a photo of you and your real employer, the @NRA when you schemed with them to keep bump stocks legal and the gun show loophole in tact so people can buy and sell assault weapons without pesky gov interference #NRABloodMoney
791 2018-02-28 21:05:46 Trump: We're going to have a vote. It's going to be a successful vote, and I will sign it. You have to be strong on background checks and mentally ill. Don't worry about bump stocks, I'll do that myself.
792 2018-02-28 21:05:43 He wants to make sure he puts more guns in the schools and you better put on paper about the bump stocks  cuz he’ll remove it altogether

795 2018-02-28 21:05:27 "Steve it's very hard to add the one thing that you want," Trump says on Scalise's push for concealed carry. Instead this NRA endorsed president is calling for "very very powerful on background checks" says he'll get rid of bump stocks on his own
796 2018-02-28 21:05:22 Trump: "Don't worry about bump stocks, you don't have to complicate the bill by adding another 2 paragraphs, I'm getting rid of it because we can."

800 2018-02-28 21:04:54 Well, it appears Pres. Trump may be screwing us law abiding citizens and pandering to the left on gun control. He stated he will use executive order to ban bump stocks for starters.
801 2018-02-28 21:04:42 Trump should offer to so his part by taking most of their bump stocks away from Eric and Don Jr.
802 2018-02-28 21:04:28 Eliminate Dickey amendment, ban bump stocks, min age 21 to buy gun and background checks.  That is what there is most agreement on . @WhiteHouse @realDonaldTrump @SenateMajLdr @SenateGOP @SenateDems @HouseGOP @HouseDemocrats @SpeakerRyan @NancyPelosi @SenFeinstein #Parkland
803 2018-02-28 21:04:26 It's odd that someone has to explain this. People are sick of the NRA because the NRA controls a majority of politicians and so nothing will change. There is nothing wrong with making the sale of "bump stocks" illegal to the general public. There is nothing wrong with... (1)

808 2018-02-28 21:04:07 @realDonaldTrump you sat by Feinstein and threw gun owners under the bus. You're feeding the banners.  They are emboldened. I am not a criminal. Bump stocks are not the problem.

Get rid of Dickey Amendment, ban bump stocks, increase age for buying gun, get rid of, what, long guns? 

NOOOOOOOOOOO
816 2018-02-28 21:03:05 Bump stocks and semi-auto rifles are only part of the problem. The NRA has created a consumer culture that thirsts for lethal mass casualty arms.

821 2018-02-28 21:02:30 A skilled shooter can mimic the rapid fire of a bump stock with just hands and fingers; no bump stock needed. To your point, bump stocks are != to a machine guns. Semi auto is one trigger per shot

823 2018-02-28 21:02:24 So @big5since55 confirms stopped selling AR-15 type rifles and high-capacity magazines in 2016. Says it never sold bump stocks.
824 2018-02-28 21:02:23 Trump keeps asking why Congresspeople in the room didn't do anything on guns until now. Reminder that WH wouldn't take position on bump stocks until after Parkland (4 months after Vegas), despite being regularly asked.

826 2018-02-28 21:02:02 Guys I think I’ve entered the Twilight Zone... I agree with Donald Trump. 

Thank you @POTUS for working towards banning the bump stocks that were used to try to kill me on Oct. 1st.

831 2018-02-28 21:00:30 @realDonaldTrump You're not into popular? Why all the talk about ratings all the time? And, a week goes by, and a week goes by and we move on - just like you did after Vegas. Took kids dying to talk about bump stocks. Oh and we had a teacher arrested with a gun today...

833 2018-02-28 20:59:54 Good start, however let's remember that bump stocks were not used in #Parkland .  Seventeen people died regardless.
#NRA #bumpstocks
834 2018-02-28 20:59:46 Yup also much stronger than the other stocks so a lot of room to catch up to on the downside
835 2018-02-28 20:59:40 Dicks quit selling ARs 6 years ago after sandy hook. FYI free publicly for them because of this BS. their stocks were up earlier today... shame
836 2018-02-28 20:59:36 Machine guns are effectively banned, as are devices that can 'convert' non-auto to auto.

If bump-stocks are considered such devices, they can be banned under existing law.

Initially, regulators said they're not such devices. That decision is now under review.
837 2018-02-28 20:59:24 Okay, why not an Executive Order banning assault weapons and raising the age limit. Just bump stocks is far from enough.
838 2018-02-28 20:59:19 You have lost all journalistic credibility.  Every sane person, even many Republican politicians (even the President), agree that banning bump stocks is absolute necessary.  You're not even a propagandist for the White House any more, you've moved straight on to the NRA.  Sad!
839 2018-02-28 20:58:59 I knew they would use bump stocks as crumbs to show they “did something.”  Banning bump stocks won’t save 1 life. #AssaultWeaponsBan @RonWyden @SenJeffMerkley

842 2018-02-28 20:58:48 Amen please pass laws to ban Bump Stocks, automatic Weapons, clips that hold more than 10 bullets. No one under 21 should be able to buy any gun

847 2018-02-28 20:58:25 The biggest issue is the magazine size, bump stocks and other after-market parts that turn regular semi-automatic rifles into fully, or near fully auto. 
See, I'm engaging you, even as you try to insult me.

851 2018-02-28 20:58:12 This is just Bump Stocks, not the guns under Executive Order. Obama took my right to own a gun under Executive Order. He named me mentally ill bc I'm on an antidepressant bc I have a terminal illness. That was an act of war!

853 2018-02-28 20:57:52 @LizClaman oil is down because the DXY is up. It's the single most reliable indicator of dollar direction. Oil is denominated in dollars, not the other way around.  DXY spiked on Jay Powell, oil falls.  Now compare stocks to the DXY.  Long run, they are inversely correlated.
854 2018-02-28 20:57:50 Oh ok. Miscommunication. Sorry. But I think Pres. Trump should not be saying he is gonna get rid of them. As a supporter he ran on protecting the 2A bump stocks had nothing to do with evil people wanted to kill people.
855 2018-02-28 20:57:49 Hes much worse believe me. He keeps calling Canadians racists homophobes islamaphobe misogynists and lots of names while he goes around the world making laughing stocks of us everywhere he goes. Worst pm in Canadian history

859 2018-02-28 20:56:59 The Supreme Court Ruled that Assault Weapons,
Weapons of War, are not included in the 2nd Amendment ! That includes Assault Weapons like
Assault Rifles, Semi-Automatic Rifles and Pistols,
Bump Stocks, Large Capacity Magazines ! The NRA has lost 3x in 10yrs to get it Legal !
860 2018-02-28 20:56:57 Ban the sale of bump stocks

Place a limit on how much ammunition a person is allowed to purchase at a time. 

Make the punishments for possessing an illegal firearm and selling them far more severe.

862 2018-02-28 20:56:52 Generally speaking, I agree w/ that sentiment. However, given he told Republicans to forget about the concealed carry provision in the bill they're working on, and given that he also seems serious about bump stocks, I'm inclined to support his decisions just this once.

873 2018-02-28 20:54:53 Bump stocks are an accessory that NRA has none to minimal business with.
874 2018-02-28 20:54:40 I wonder what happened? All of a sudden @realDonaldTrump is gonna ban bump stocks, and he's telling Republicans to ditch the concealed carry provision in the bill they're working on. Today (and today only) he seems like the sanest Republican.
875 2018-02-28 20:54:34 I'm just saying that's what the bump stocks were supposed to be for

881 2018-02-28 20:53:13 I'm sure in that meeting, he told the nra he needed a win on the issue and what they can support him and gop signing into law. Bump stocks are made by a third party company so it won't hurt gun manufacturers one penny in profits.

884 2018-02-28 20:52:31 @jimcramer  You may know about stocks and investing but you are ignorant when it comes to firearms. The AR-15 is a popular choice for a wide range of hunting pursuits. The small caliber, light weight bullet, typically limits it to smaller game like coyotes, woodchucks, or hogs.
885 2018-02-28 20:52:26 Stick with stocks @jimcramer because you obviously know nothing about the firearms or hunting industry.

889 2018-02-28 20:52:07 Of course not. He's needs to maintain enough distance to keep his base happy. He's simply trying to direct Congress to look at the issue. He's a populace. The only thing he's committed to is banning bump stocks. Which is supported by the vast majority of Americans.
890 2018-02-28 20:52:06 Imagine the cries of "executive overreach" and "tyranny" if Obama had even mentioned an executive order banning bump stocks. It will be interesting to see the reaction to Trump talking about it.  #utpol #USPolitics
891 2018-02-28 20:52:06 Theres a difference btwn rate of fire and muzzle velocity. Bump stocks and hi-cap mags affect rate of fire—which amplifies the overall casualties of these attacks, than muzzle velocity—which increases the lethality of an individual wound, but is unaffected by bumpstocks & hi-caps

900 2018-02-28 20:51:03 In all, last count, about $3B in better benefits to workers. 
OTOH, $77B to CEOs and stock holders. Recall that most working families have bonds, stocks or 401Ks. Practically none have Estates either, but GOP gave huge cuts to UBER RICH.
901 2018-02-28 20:50:59 Something no ones mentioning, banning bump stocks will require a mass confiscation... and good luck with that one
902 2018-02-28 20:50:58 Bump stocks? Auto weapons are not banned. There was a ban but that was ended.

Q: The number of lives that will be saved by banning bump stocks.
910 2018-02-28 20:50:09 @williamsforga “You cannot regulate evil out of existence,Blaming guns or bump stocks for the actions of a lunatic, is the same as blaming McDonald’s for heart disease.” So, using the that argument, I assume you are for legalizing marijuana then?? It's not the herb, it's the user
911 2018-02-28 20:50:08 @SteveScalise  cite some valuable carry instances.  Keep our legislation clean/ simple so it will be passed.  Legislators pile on many issues in bills to stall them .Don't need  50-100  pages to ban bump stocks/define and ban  semi automatic weapons and high capacity magazines,
912 2018-02-28 20:50:07 1st Obama kills off all those Amercians with the Ebola outbreak.  Now he will do it all over again with this Lassa Fever.  
Just glad we are heavily armed here in the South with our bump stocks and large capacity mags so that we, the well regulated militia can kill these rats!
913 2018-02-28 20:50:07 it is an easy trade what ever the market is doing up or down they can color the tape and exsasserbate the moves in the last half hour cause there is no buybacks      the really good stocks go down a little and go up alot    so many of them out there
914 2018-02-28 20:50:04 Trump said earlier he would just get rid of bump stocks with an EO... it's been established that he can't
915 2018-02-28 20:49:37 #update #stocks slide approaching closing bell #Dow down nearly 300 @KNX1070 @MottekOnMoney
916 2018-02-28 20:49:27 By the way, bump stocks were invented more than 50 years after the automatic weapons ban.
917 2018-02-28 20:49:18 Peter isn't doing the math. Rates at 6% would cause $3 Trillion in losses to UST bond holders alone. Corporate rates would go up. You'd have $15 Trillion in global bond holder losses. Many big leveraged stocks, REITs, and banks would go bust.  It can't be allowed to happen.
918 2018-02-28 20:49:11 TRUMP GUN STANCES:

Arming teachers: Would like to arm up to 40% 
Bump stocks: Will try to ban through EO
Raising purchase age to 21 for some guns: Should be discussed
Concealed carry expansion: Put in a different bill down the road
Expanding background checks: Should be done

920 2018-02-28 20:48:34 Trump on a listening session with Republicans and Democrats knowing full well that banning Bump Stocks will take legislative actions. He is still attempting to force guns in our schools where we send our children to trust, learn and be safe.

925 2018-02-28 20:47:51 Banning bump stocks is a good idea, but that still leaves the real item, assault weapons. Wannabe killers will just buy the real deal! Ban both or it’s just more lip service!!

928 2018-02-28 20:47:26 Didn't he have lunch with the @NRA big shots this past weekend? This has all been carefully orchestrated. NRA will concede on bump stocks and Trump will look like a hero. He'll say he tried on the age thing but wouldn't get buy off. "I got you bump stocks, I make the best deals".
929 2018-02-28 20:47:24 If an executive order can be used to ban bump stocks can it also be used to ban 30 round magazines? They are both accessories after all.
#2A @DLoesch @ChrisLoesch
930 2018-02-28 20:47:19 Please answer my question first. Or do you concede that borrowing $1.5 trillion in order for Corps to payoff stock owners is counter productive especially given that 10% of wealthiest U.S. Households own 84% of stocks (as of 2016)?
931 2018-02-28 20:47:14 I think my conclusion would be that the federal govt has no authority to outlaw bump stocks.  And yet the people cheer this lawless behavior. So I think they can hardly complain when the govt oversteps in so many other areas.
932 2018-02-28 20:47:10 But Reagan called them "machine guns". I carried a M16 for years in the USMC it has 2 modes semi-automatic and fully automatic. They are getting rid of the bump stocks. They would have to ban all semi-automatics including 22 long rifles. They would just come with S/A pistols.
933 2018-02-28 20:47:06 Which guns did they grab? What crisis? I haven't heard him say anything other than banning bump stocks and arming teachers and school staff who are trained and comfortable
934 2018-02-28 20:47:04 What do bump stocks and executive orders by 45 have in common? They both work as a knee-jerk reaction. I predict lawsuits before the ink is even dry on that one.
935 2018-02-28 20:46:59 We are greedy we take more than we need millions of tins sit in millions of shops throughout the world,cod stocks dwindled, it goes on mate think about out it,do we really need it all, it's all about money,we are destructive.
936 2018-02-28 20:46:53 By how much will US stock returns beat this yield over the next decade? And how much volatility will stock investors have to endure to beat this yield? What will the Sharpe Ratio of stocks be for the trailing 10-year period a decade from now?
937 2018-02-28 20:46:48 This morning, I posted twice, "Don't be complacent here." See why? #stocks #investing
938 2018-02-28 20:46:39 Did not claim that bump stocks were not legal, but that they should not have been regulatorily approved. Public did not learn of the circumvention until LV tragedy & so now bump stock approval will be revoked by regulation rather than litigation. Read what I wrote again please
939 2018-02-28 20:46:19 Even the NRA has advocated tighter controls on bump stocks. Eliminating them is the right way to go.
940 2018-02-28 20:46:05 Stocks down into the close a bit. TREND STILL DOWN, HALF HEDGES in place. Not many new buy candidates or anything to do but to enjoy the ride.
941 2018-02-28 20:46:00 Here’s the thing... banning sale of bump stocks does nothing. You can easily make one yourself (look it up). But i’m SURE nobody will think of doing that with their brand new Walmart AR-15 that they bought on a whim while shopping for tube socks
942 2018-02-28 20:45:59 why didn't Trump ban bump stocks immediately after Las Vegas???
943 2018-02-28 20:45:51 Tired of this manipulative lip service. STFU and DO something. DO NOT arm teachers with guns. Ban Bump stocks, Ban Military Style Guns, raise age limit from 18 to 21 and strengthen background checks!
944 2018-02-28 20:45:43 Or this: "Birth control is not contraception indiscriminately and thoughtlessly practiced. It means the release and cultivation of the better racial elements in our society, and the gradual suppression, elimination and eventual extirpation of defective stocks." NY Times 1923
945 2018-02-28 20:45:29 I understand the point you're making, but it just doesn't matter. Why can't I have an M249? Or an M27? Because we have already chosen to draw an arbitrary line. Putting bump stocks on the other side of that line is the least we can do.
946 2018-02-28 20:45:17 Just saw their stocks are down
947 2018-02-28 20:45:07 That just reinforces what I said??? Correlation continues. Dollar falls, stocks rise.
948 2018-02-28 20:44:56 Sure, super evil bump stocks, meanwhile @FBI & @browardsheriff ignored every indication that Cruz was a time bomb. Where's the fix for that???
949 2018-02-28 20:44:54 After Bush/Cheney enriched on Iraq war with their Hallliburton stocks & Trump is enriching himself, GOP is nothing but crime family abusing women & now children.

951 2018-02-28 20:44:53 He’ll say anything. He met with the NRA on Sunday, I’m sure he told them not to worry. If he follows through on ANYTHING he’s saying besides banning bump stocks I’ll be floored. When he asks for the press to be present for an extended time, he’s about to lie. Every. Time.
952 2018-02-28 20:44:34 Whatever side if he gets the ban on bump stocks and raising the age to 21 give kudos. Its not the end fix but its a start
953 2018-02-28 20:44:18 Ok don't have a problem with that and your problem with that is what? I don't think Pres. Trump should make bump stocks illegal. As a supporter of his. I would tell him not to go there.

956 2018-02-28 20:43:18 I am a big  NRA supporter and gun enthusiast
bump stocks use the recoil of the first round to pull the trigger for subsequent rounds as long as some pressure is applied to trigger 
it in essence does make a semi automatic fully automatic though is not as reliable as real thing
957 2018-02-28 20:43:10 I agree that access to mental healthcare and insurance coverage for that care is critical. Access to the AR-15, high capacity magazines and bump stocks are also part of the problem.

961 2018-02-28 20:42:47 Trump saying he was going to write up an executive order banning bump stocks is a helluva thing.
962 2018-02-28 20:42:33 Local means Dems and if they decide against it,their pensions should be based on Dems not guns,the word pension stock sounds a little familiar to gun stocks
963 2018-02-28 20:42:24 The point of a ban on bomb making materials, "assault weapons", high-capacity magazines, or bump stocks is to limit the amount of damage a single unhealthy person can do, not villianize people who hunt or have a handgun for self defense.
964 2018-02-28 20:42:11 The sharp pullback earlier this month caused the first monthly decline for the S&P 500 since Oct 2016. Fortunately, stocks are still positive for 2018. We remain constructive on equities, especially cyclical sectors, but volatility is likely to remain as interest rates normalize.
965 2018-02-28 20:41:49 Bump-stocks are pointless anyway.
966 2018-02-28 20:41:42 @realDonaldTrump Please don't become Obama. Banning bump stocks via executive order is not within your powers (I believe), nor appropriate. You were partly voted in to move away from actions like this. Let legislators legislate please.
967 2018-02-28 20:41:40 BACKGROUND CHECKS ARE GREAT BUT PEOPLE ARE STILL OBTAINING  AR's AND BUMP STOCKS AND KEEP KILLING BECAUSE AR's AND BUMP STOCKS ARE AVAILABLE TO CIVILIANS...BAN THEM PERIOD!

970 2018-02-28 20:41:11 I never know what he's talking about. He's such a poor communicator. "That will be gone." What will be gone? The bump stocks? Or the legislation to outlaw bump stocks? Doesn't matter either way, he can't and won't do anything about the problem  #DumpTrump
971 2018-02-28 20:40:54 It’s nice to have you knowledge on here. So many examples of people in the media falling flat on their face when it comes to this conversation. My question would be do you believe in banning bump stocks?
972 2018-02-28 20:40:23 U.S. stocks fall; Dow, S&P 500 on track to snap 10-month winning streak
U.S. stocks fell in a volatile session on Wednesday, reversing their earlier gains as Wall Street digested data that were seen as underlining the economy’s fundamental strength
973 2018-02-28 20:40:16 But the NRA supports the banning of bump stocks so... 
974 2018-02-28 20:39:59 Trump is holding a bipartisan talk in regards to school shootings, gun laws, and what laws can be passed to help prevent future shootings! He stressed the need for action, and not just words! He states he will right executive order banning bump stocks, so Congress doesn’t have to
975 2018-02-28 20:39:34 Agreed. There needs to be a permanent fix for bump stocks. An EO does not cut it.
976 2018-02-28 20:39:34 Dow down 200 $amzn $aapl $nflx up. I guess you really can’t lose in these stocks
977 2018-02-28 20:39:12 I think largely we still run a Voodoo economy. What's the percentage of the deposits are interest bearing? What instruments where the funds invested in (Bond, stocks, loans to HNI)? I agree the cost structure is alarming but our bankers are very "creative".
978 2018-02-28 20:39:10 So President Dunning Kruger is going to solve gun control and "write out" bump stocks. I wish he realized how fucking dumb he sounds.
979 2018-02-28 20:38:59 Only the criminals will have bump stocks
980 2018-02-28 20:38:48 Just need a little help from us sometimes as we've taken most of their fish stocks so only right if we can give them something back,they have little about because of humans.,think about it!
981 2018-02-28 20:38:27 After he checks back with his handlers at the NRA to see what is acceptable to them. Bumps stocks are are a loss leader to gain political foothold on assault weapons.
982 2018-02-28 20:38:17 Bout to invest in stocks. Slowly learning the game
983 2018-02-28 20:38:14 GOP power brokers don’t understand marriage with Dixiecrats & Trump too inexperienced to know he’s being lead to the alter. Let’s put this in terms trump will understand, it’s when Goldman Sachs pushed Lehman Brothers off exchange then bought up all their stocks pennies on the $.
984 2018-02-28 20:38:00 I’d like to know which “lawyers” are working on this. No lawyer I know thinks it’s possible to ban bump stocks through an executive order (especially not any conservative ones).
985 2018-02-28 20:37:54 I agree, the age of 21 makes no difference.
If you are mentally ill, you won't be sane, because you're 21 years old.
Nobody needs bump stocks.... I don't know why anyone, would defend them !!!!!
Without background checks, someone straight out of prison, can legally have a gun.

987 2018-02-28 20:37:25 I support much stricter guns laws, but PTSD is a mental illness, and our servicemen and women greatly suffer from it during combat times, and years after. Ban assault weapons, armor piercing bullets, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, background checks stricter to start..
988 2018-02-28 20:37:25 i mean, at least they're making bump stocks illegal immediately..
989 2018-02-28 20:37:09 What about taxes Will?  Pre tax, the stocks outperform (79x to 29x, which is a pretty decent spread).  More importantly, after taxes the delta is even wider.
990 2018-02-28 20:37:07 Che’s I don’t think you are correct on this. Trustees job is to act in best interest of trust. So sometimes by example they would buy or sell stocks. To preserve value of trust might require sales
991 2018-02-28 20:37:04 Sure, let's make sure we don't hurt any stocks of those were are investigating. That seems legit.
992 2018-02-28 20:36:51 People frown on the stock market. I think its only bad if you trying to hit a home run and be rich quick.

Had a convo with someone today who retired early because his parents taught him at a young age how to invest in stocks. Not the 1st time i heard this. Its something there.
993 2018-02-28 20:36:45 Trump just said he was going to write up an executive order to ban bumb stocks.
994 2018-02-28 20:36:33 Illinois House passes a bill banning bump stocks.

997 2018-02-28 20:35:50 His statements are all jumbled though. 1) Corker talks about a proposed bill, including bump-stocks. 2) When Corker mentions this, trump interrupts and says he’s going to “write out” bump-stocks through EO, so Corker doesn’t have to worry about it.
998 2018-02-28 20:35:48 that's great a few months later after Las Vegas. Bump stocks is where the buck stops because POTUS is backing off the age requirement.

1001 2018-02-28 20:35:35 Horse manure. Even if we don't own individual stocks we are benefited by a healthy stock market, especially those folks with retirement accounts, mutual funds or those working for companies who are in the stock market. Stop preying on those who don't understand the market.
1002 2018-02-28 20:35:35 @realDonaldTrump dumb to leave out a ban on assault weapons along with bump stocks.  These don't infringe on rights, and not necessary for personal protection or hunting. Don't be afraid of NRA do the right thing
1003 2018-02-28 20:35:31 Most of the folks I have asked don’t expect Powell will walk back on what he said before the House panel. With a second day sell-off in stocks, he might look to stop the hemorrhage before the Senate Banking Committee tomorrow. #PowellPut
1004 2018-02-28 20:35:24 #Whitehouse #NRA The answer should be no more ARs or bump stocks. Its not about the age limit on these weapons. Remember the guy in Vegas?? He was well over 21. We just need to ban these weapons entirely! Plus better background checks.
1005 2018-02-28 20:35:23 Hmmm @MSNBC trump talking about bump stocks
1006 2018-02-28 20:35:15 Media reporting "Trump's saying he'll ban bump stocks by EO" should be required to add: 
a) this is what the NRA wants
b) actual legislation is required & a standalone ban could pass / be signed in a day
c) any EO will be written so it can be immediately challenged in court
1007 2018-02-28 20:35:06 I think bump stocks should be in any bill that’s proposed. 45’s word is not exactly meaningful right now.

1009 2018-02-28 20:34:38 The bi-partisan panel with President Trump has talked about bump stocks, mental illness, AR-15's, better background checks, raising firearms purchase age.
Church shooting and recent stabbings were stopped by civilians with AR-15's.
Only Armed adults in classrooms will save kids.
1010 2018-02-28 20:34:37 I’m gonna, I’m gonna??? Bump stocks? That’s the best you can do? Stop pounding your chest and flapping your gums and DO SOMETHING SIGNIFICANT!!
1011 2018-02-28 20:34:30 All true; however, if automatic fire weapons are legitimately banned, it's logical and legitimate that bump stocks could be also. They violate the clear intent of an auto-fire ban.
1012 2018-02-28 20:34:27 Trump just said he was going to issue an EO banning bump stocks. Now bracing for liberals who've been demanding that to call it a meaningless gesture. #WaitForIt
1013 2018-02-28 20:34:23 A bad end to a bad month (for stocks).
1014 2018-02-28 20:34:16 I feel that Trump is going to be write the order banning bump stocks to give republicans political cover. If it were put to a vote congress would have to make s public stand. I guess as long as it’s done.
1015 2018-02-28 20:34:14 There are plenty of other devices out there to ban also. Not just bump stocks . You have to ban all semi automatic weapons. They all can be changed to work like automatic weapons. Getting rid of bump stocks is just ruse . Bet NRA gave the ok to do so.
1016 2018-02-28 20:34:10 @jimdandy1977 how silly of me, I forgot, stocks never go down only up.  Never get attacked by posers spreading misinformation.
1017 2018-02-28 20:33:37 You can explain the difference between semi and full auto and how full auto is highly regulated and how bump stocks operate and that “assault rifles” are just rifles until you are blue in the face... the left will mischaracterize and misrepresent

1022 2018-02-28 20:32:55 No reason for bump stocks.  Try using one on regular basis and see how quickly you mess your gun up.  Most guns not designed to fire that fast.  Only purpose of these things is to kill rapidly.
1023 2018-02-28 20:32:53 Secure schools - what about concerts, movie theaters, churches, night clubs...

Use same regs as for driving & owning a car.
1024 2018-02-28 20:32:31 First time he's mentioned "stocks" in a while.
1025 2018-02-28 20:32:19 Exactly! And bump stocks kill accuracy! Worthless!
1026 2018-02-28 20:31:37 Please someone, anyone explain to him how the well funded NRA will fight an EO banning bump stocks in the Courts.   It must be included in legislation.

1028 2018-02-28 20:31:24 Another show for the cameras & Trump satisfying his need for constant attention. 

IF YOU’RE GOING TO BAN BUMP STOCKS, THEN FU&KING DO IT. ANNOUNCING IT EVERY DAY IS ALL SHOW. WE’VE BEEN DOWN THIS DEAD END ROAD SINCE JAN 20, 2017 TIME AFTER TIME & NOTHING EVER HAPPENS
1029 2018-02-28 20:31:05 Apparently the President doesn’t realize an executive order banning bump stocks isn’t a permanent fix to the problem … he seems to think a law is unnecessary. Why wouldn’t he want a law?  What’s he hiding?
1030 2018-02-28 20:31:03 stocks are really weird but, i like it. hopefully I’m doing well
1031 2018-02-28 20:30:58 Right. We could ban bump stocks this afternoon, but find out later that they're the cure for cancer.

1036 2018-02-28 20:30:05 And will an executive order on bump stocks be tied up in the courts for years?  don't color Americans stupid.  It is a simple bill that can be voted up or down by our Congress who will not act until "Simon (aka Trump)" says so.  Despicable.
1037 2018-02-28 20:29:57 He know's as much about "guns" as he does about investing. Based on his advice in the 08/09 market meltdown, he knows nothing. Exceptionally bad advise on stocks & also on guns.
1038 2018-02-28 20:29:48 Trump has been told repeatedly what Obama was told before him...the elimination of bump stocks requires Congressional action.

Threatening a Constitutional right, is equally insane. More blood lost gaining and preserving #2A than caused because of it.
1043 2018-02-28 20:29:16 Of course! The answer to my question might be in the white paper which I haven’t gotten to yet, who are people constructing the portfolios and which selection process will they use? Do they have a history in investment (forex stocks commodities cryptos etc) public track record?
1044 2018-02-28 20:29:16 I bet these assholes end up only banning a couple different styles of bump stocks, pat themselves on the back for a job well done and effecting real change and then call it a day

1045 2018-02-28 20:29:12 @realDonalTrump I am listening to you speaking as I type. I heard you say that you intend to remove bump stocks by Executive Order. I admit to you sir, that this is the first piece of legislation you will sign that I totally support. I appreciate this bipartisan effort.

1048 2018-02-28 20:29:02 Is it weird we're talking about bump stocks after a shooting that didn't involve them? That seems weird to me.
1049 2018-02-28 20:28:56 And how many massacred students would have been murdered if bump stocks had been banned?... Oh wait, still 17.  Re-Phrase:  And what is the GOP doing to stop our Nation's next mass killing?... Nothing and shoring up their millions of dollars of NRA donations
1050 2018-02-28 20:28:54 .Suddenly liberals love bump stocks because Trump is taking action to ban them.
1051 2018-02-28 20:28:51 did you not read the CnN tweets? POTUS will go down in history for the most gun control measures completed (bump stocks/mental health laws/ age requirements) !!!!! In reality, ObuMmeR didnt even care enough about the weekly massacres in Chicago to do anything about it!!!!
1052 2018-02-28 20:28:41 Bump stocks need to be legislated out of existence.  An executive order will just get reversed eventually by some NRA schill.
1053 2018-02-28 20:28:35 Oh my God, I can't believe I'm gonna say this, but Trump actually said something right during his live meeting today. He called out senators on being too afraid of the NRA to pass proper laws. And he advocated for raising the age to purchase guns to 21 AND banning bump stocks.
1054 2018-02-28 20:28:29 I want to see his executive order on bump stocks within 1 hour if we don't see it then this is all nothing more than a dog and pony show
1055 2018-02-28 20:27:41 An order to ban bump stocks would be useless unless congress votes to make it a law. An executive order can’t write law,  only interpret existing law. #bumpstocks #GunControl
1056 2018-02-28 20:27:41 I don’t think anything will solve it but we can put more laws in place. Bump stocks can be illegal. Raise the legal age. 3 day background checks. I have an AR, obviously don’t use it for anything like that but I could give it up.
1057 2018-02-28 20:27:37 Bump Stocks?

1058 2018-02-28 20:27:25 Great for those who buy and sell stocks but Dicks announcement wasn't only reason for those stocks dipping. We need to know much of a percentage of assault rifle sales did Dicks make up to determine that.  That's why how many assault rifles they sold is important to know....
1059 2018-02-28 20:26:50 Kudos to @POTUS... Zero need for bump stocks. 
1060 2018-02-28 20:26:46 There's a distinction between LP redemptions and mark-to-market of fund holdings represented by tradable tokens. The fire sale refers to the former. The latter, by itself, is a can of worms; it also deters long-term thinking by the fund (i.e. quarterly reports ala stocks)
1061 2018-02-28 20:26:46 FYI, doing a executive order doesn't do anything really.  Bump stocks won't be made illegal simply by Trump signing a piece of paper, that says I wish for bump stocks to be banned. It requires Congress ultimately to pass legislation.  #BanAssaultWeaponsNow
1062 2018-02-28 20:26:26 Bump Stocks are not the problem. AR-15's are the problem. A rubber band can do the same thing as a bump stock.

1068 2018-02-28 20:26:04 The 2nd amendment grants the right to own and bear arms right? Bump stocks, silencers, high round mags, scopes are accessories not arms. Bullets are an accessory, not an arm. Theoretically an executive order banning all of those wouldn't violate the constitution.
1069 2018-02-28 20:25:51 President @̶B̶a̶r̶a̶c̶k̶O̶b̶a̶m̶a̶  @realDonaldTrump says he can restrict 'bump stocks' with an executive order.
1070 2018-02-28 20:25:45 How would raising the minimum gun purchasing age have affected the Las Vegas massacre? How would the Las Vegas massacre been impacted if assault weapons and bump stocks had been banned? Which would be more effective at prevention?
1071 2018-02-28 20:25:40 @realDonaldTrump thinks "bump stocks will be gone" because he "writes about them on a separate piece of paper".  This is a direct quote from him just now.
1072 2018-02-28 20:25:37 "Chris Murphy" was right but the fix nix doesn’t do crap! Same old loop holes. Toomey has it right. BTW, Trump bashing Obama is disgusting & anyone else catch Trump just shot down LEGISLATION on bump stocks bc he wants to sign an EO himself. How egotistical and IGNORANT of LAW!
1073 2018-02-28 20:25:33 Also, saying he's just gonna write an EO to create a new law banning bump stocks, even though he said DACA was totally illegal and had to be repealed, because you can't write law via EO.
1074 2018-02-28 20:25:18 sounds like he wants to do more on gun control than oBuMmer ever wanted!!! POTUS will make illegal bump stocks, which ObumMeR approved for sale!!!!!!
1075 2018-02-28 20:25:16 FYI @POTUS has been talking about changes he wants to gun laws all week. Outlaw bump stocks, Increase age to 21, stiffer background checks, etc, etc.
1076 2018-02-28 20:25:03 also why is banning bump stocks an effective enforcement mechanism, but banning certain types of weapons is unenforceable?
1077 2018-02-28 20:25:02 He can't do that. ATF has already told Congress that it does not have the authority to regulate Bump Stocks.

1083 2018-02-28 20:24:27 Good work. But I hope this isn't just a small concession to shut further gun control down. Bump stocks ban should have happend right after Las Vegas.

1088 2018-02-28 20:23:45 Get your facts right.  Dick's will no longer sell assault weapons, high capacity magazines or bump stocks.  They will continue to sell other firearms, but only to individuals 21 years old and over.

1093 2018-02-28 20:23:19 I disagree. I don’t think anyone would have a problem with “banning” bump stocks or some other appeasement that doesn’t really amount to much
1094 2018-02-28 20:23:07 FOX News radio was playing a feed of Trump talking with a group of senators about what to do about mass shootings, and he seems really committed. He’s writing bump stocks out via an exec order.
1095 2018-02-28 20:23:03 @realDonaldTrump 

Thank you for the bump stock executive order.   May I suggest a change.  

"It shall be illegal to alter the factory rate of fire of any firearm."

It is extremely easy to alter an ak47, AR, hand gun and shoot gun platforms.   Just doing the stocks is a bandaid
1096 2018-02-28 20:23:02 I don’t really care either way about bump stocks ! I think Trump is trying to comprise with left so they will STHU! We know that will never happen @RodEccles

1098 2018-02-28 20:22:39 Trump....if u ban bump stocks, coyote guns (AR 10 & AR 15), or start dicking around with my access and affordability of ammo, I'm sad to say you won't see another vote from millions of your biggest supporters.

You're being ridiculous, legal users of these tools aren't a problem.
1099 2018-02-28 20:22:29 Good to hear that @POTUS is going to ban bump stocks via executive order. No need for them at all.

1103 2018-02-28 20:22:15 Hmm wanna bet GOP MoC are heavily investing in vest, gun, ammo & security firm stocks?
1104 2018-02-28 20:22:11 Still a ways to go and none of the school shooting did they use bump stocks  so we will see
1105 2018-02-28 20:21:59 @HighwaysToday where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
1106 2018-02-28 20:21:56 at first i thought you just meant all stocks   LOL
1107 2018-02-28 20:21:56 It’s looking like a nasty close for stocks.
1108 2018-02-28 20:21:37 It's time to bring the @NRA to heel. The American people are in favor of background checks and licensed gun dealers. The American people don't want bump stocks. #NeverAgain

1110 2018-02-28 20:21:27 He has no idea what is going on. He just wants the photo op and his name on banning bump stocks so he can say he did something.
1111 2018-02-28 20:21:25 Trump going to ban bump stocks on executive order. This still won't make all those liberals, that were calling for this same thing after LV, happy.

1112 2018-02-28 20:21:19 Jesse is very bearish on stocks.
1113 2018-02-28 20:21:18 Instead of protecting the life of an unborn fetus, how about protecting our children from being slaughtered by banning Assault Weapons, Bump stocks, and large capacity magazines.
1114 2018-02-28 20:21:17 HB1467, a bill banning bump stocks just passed the House in Illinois. This is a first step to ensure our citizens are safe in our communities. But we must do more. #GunReformNow #twill
1115 2018-02-28 20:21:17 These stocks are smokin today
1116 2018-02-28 20:21:16 Trump makes an effort and snowflakes attack. Obama did nothing on guns other than approve bump stocks and he is a democratic hero. Snowflake logic get stranger by the day.
1117 2018-02-28 20:20:59 OMG I hate this man.  He stated the Toomey bill didn't pass because of Obama.  He has no clue how the process works!
How many days has he said he's going to do an Executive Order for the gun stocks?  Why hasn't it been done!
1118 2018-02-28 20:20:49 Bump stocks were under regulatory review & should never have been approved for manufacture & installation on weapons under then existing law circumventing automatic weapons prohibitions. Have ppl been fired or disciplined?
1119 2018-02-28 20:20:45 he needs to stick to stocks.
1120 2018-02-28 20:20:43 Joe Manchin, Dem is arguing for Bump stocks, not against with 45.WTAF?

1122 2018-02-28 20:20:41 Kusal Perera is a decent middle order bat. Munaweera is one of the few big-hitting options Sri Lanka has. They're not good, I admit. But given SL's limited stocks, we can only improvise. If a 3rd seamer is needed, I would look at either Perera or Pradeep.
1123 2018-02-28 20:20:31 About all that money coming into stocks on the month end rebalancing ...
1124 2018-02-28 20:20:25 Trump says he can ban bump stocks with executive order. If so, why didn’t Obama do it? Why hasn’t Trump?
1125 2018-02-28 20:20:20 Bump stocks do nothing for accuracy, it's spray and pray. By the way my trigger finger can replicate that. However I take time to  aim. One shot one kill as they say.
1126 2018-02-28 20:20:15 The problem is we as ‘fans’ & ‘pundits’ don’t know the laws of the game as much as the refs do, plus they change the laws every summer (like that pen decision - that change this summer?) tbf it’s their job however we should be able to hear and see their decisions with VAR
1127 2018-02-28 20:20:13 Obama tried but couldn't because his justice department found it illegal and banning bump stocks can only be done by congress.
1128 2018-02-28 20:20:03 lol i thought he was talking about YUP, the recent bumps in stocks!!!
AHAHAHAHAHA, wont forget this one!!!
1129 2018-02-28 20:19:52 @ParksKMBZ Bump stocks could be banned as a way to make fully-automatic weapons, which are against the law unless licensed.

However, Congress should pass that law, not POTUS.
1130 2018-02-28 20:19:49 oh lord ... get your bump stocks now... !!!!! the pressure to supply at this moment must be intense. no greater salesman nor subconscious awakener than a prohibition on X ....
1131 2018-02-28 20:19:44 but lower than many retail stocks today...
1132 2018-02-28 20:19:26 he just gave a little mini press thing with cornyn  on getting rid of bump stocks? was that it.. I'm always hoping it's the fbi coming in...
1133 2018-02-28 20:19:17 $CEI - isn't closing how I imagined but thats why I wait until EOD to pick up plays typically. 

On the other hand

1135 2018-02-28 20:19:02 And he says don’t include bump stocks in it.
1136 2018-02-28 20:18:52 @AliVelshi Love how @realDonaldTrump tells them not to outlaw bump-stocks in legislation(only way it can be), because he’s going to get rid of them w/executive order,when he already knows that he can’t get rid of them w/an executive order!NRA made sure of that at lunch on Sunday!
1137 2018-02-28 20:18:51 Why can’t @POTUS do what @DICKS did today?????????? Enough distracting talk about bump stocks and background checks. @MomsDemand @Alyssa_Milano
1138 2018-02-28 20:18:47 We're gonna need a show of hands here? I need volunteers to go to these addresses and collect all the bump stocks nationwide...anyone? Bueller...Bueller...Bueller? 
1139 2018-02-28 20:18:46 It shocks me how someone like Trump would impetuously "ban" bump stocks without asking a single question about the nature of what exactly happened in Las Vegas. I dont know what happened, but it appears much most serious than "bump stocks."
1140 2018-02-28 20:18:40 @realDonaldTrump we're very happy you're finally acknowledging these massacres, especially since the only things that have happened since the Las Vegas concert and Texas church shootings were thoughts & prayers. Bump stocks should have been outlawed the next day. #NeverAgain
1141 2018-02-28 20:18:38 Trump talking gun control, protecting schools & students. He's doing an EO on bump stocks! Feinstein has submitted info to him on banning assault weapons. He'll look it over. He needs to support the bills. He needs to stop criticizing Obama & step up himself.
1142 2018-02-28 20:18:35 They are talking about bump stocks and again, he doesn't listen. Who CANNOT listen creates all the problems.
1143 2018-02-28 20:18:23 I'm not and have never said ban guns. I believe you s/h a handgun safely locked away at home for protection for you & your family. A rifle for hunting. Why does anyone need assault weapons bump stocks etc. I think police or highly trained security sb at entrances of schools along
1144 2018-02-28 20:18:23 Do you agree with Trump in "writing out" bump stocks?
1145 2018-02-28 20:18:21 #DXY continues to drive the bus, rallies back up to 90.60 and Oil and Stocks fall again. The resilience of Gold and Silver by comparison is impressive so far.
1146 2018-02-28 20:18:13 Bump stocks became legal under Obama. Democrats defended hom, said that there was nothing that Obama could have done to prevent that. But Trump says that he can get rid of it with an executive order. So knowing that, wouldn't you say that Obama is partially responsible for Vegas?
1147 2018-02-28 20:18:12 @realdonaldtrump sabotaging the banning of bump stocks in broad daylight. 

Write the law.

1150 2018-02-28 20:18:03 He is meeting with lawmakers and expected to sign an executive order to ban bump stocks.
1151 2018-02-28 20:18:01 I’m getting worried. Bump stocks and maybe a ar15. I was always worried that trump would do this
1152 2018-02-28 20:17:54 I'm not Trump fan but if he actually signs an order banning bump stocks I'll give him props.
1153 2018-02-28 20:17:49 If you are already rich, who cares ? But all the easy money in every asset class was made before 09 or before 07 specifically. If you bought gold, real estate, blue chip bonds or stocks in the mid 90's, you made all the easy money. All you had to do was show up.
1154 2018-02-28 20:17:41 Ban assault style rifles and bump stocks will be useless.
1155 2018-02-28 20:17:35 @realDonaldTrump: "I'm going to write an EO to ban bumb stocks" 

I 100% agree! I wonder if the outrage and argument that Obama's EO's were unconstitutional will be applied here

1156 2018-02-28 20:17:35 Age-limit & bump-stocks are gimmes. Adam Lanza's mom bought him his guns. But is your solution to confiscate all semi-auto long guns? I want the discussion to focus on crime guns & mandated treatment of the walking crazies.
1157 2018-02-28 20:17:32 Any draft dodging coward could ban bump stocks...ban assault rifles, raise the age limit, do something that takes guts you lying freak!

1159 2018-02-28 20:17:25 @POTUS trump Mr President Barack Obama tryed to get bump stocks off the gun stores but THE NRA has there $$$$$$ in the Congress pockets. So DO not say its you that will help.
Fucking MORON trump.
1160 2018-02-28 20:17:16 im short in a major league way on certain individual stocks up to 4-8K shares each. waiting for hell to rip open.
1161 2018-02-28 20:17:16 Yep the Business corps are buying their stocks back and throwing crumbs at the little people. A fine mess you gave the people
1162 2018-02-28 20:17:09 If he actually sticks to it and he gets politicians to stick to it, I think that raising the age rules, getting rid of bump stocks and hopefully, banning assault weapons for civilian use are GOOD, solid steps forward. Just, please, stick to it, Trump. Don't back down to the NRA.
1163 2018-02-28 20:16:58 NO one believe you @realDonaldTrump that YOU WILL help to do ANYTHING that goes against the @NRA including bump stocks OMG SHUT UP THE FIRST THING YOU DID WAS MAKE IT EASIER FOR MENTALLY ILL PPL TO BUY GUNS 
1164 2018-02-28 20:16:51 Does Donald understands That These are NOT Investment Stocks?
1165 2018-02-28 20:16:36 Now dumb fuck is suggesting executive order on bump stocks is good enough.  And telling senators who have been around so much longer than him how to legislate.  And suggestions on the “title”. You dumb fuck, it’s the NRA and GOP that have stopped everything not presidents.

1172 2018-02-28 20:16:01 You are wrong on bump stocks @realDonaldTrump Give them an inch they will take miles and miles. Fight back strong for the security of our 2nd amendment.

Two things:

1. Image the outrage from the Right if Obama had proposed banning bump stocks through EO;

2. If he thinks he can ban bump stocks through EO why hasn’t he?

1177 2018-02-28 20:15:21 @realDonaldTrump I've said it before and I'll say it again-if you raise the age to purchase guns then you need to raise military enrollment age!!! If 18 isn't old enough to buy a gun then it's not old enough to fight for our country!!! Also leave BUMP STOCKS ALONE!!!!

1186 2018-02-28 20:14:40 Trump wants to change the second amendment starting with bump stocks. Call him out and tell him NO. The 2nd amendment is not just for hunting. It's for defense against tyranny.

1192 2018-02-28 20:14:20 The “point” is a ban is a meaningless gesture that cannot affect the sorts of crimes so-called bump stocks are imagined to be useful for—and gun bans have dangerous consequences for the self-defense of law-abiding citizens.
1193 2018-02-28 20:14:16 hey @realdonaldtrump have you not heard about Dalton High School today???????  & why don't you write an EO to ban selling military equivalent high capacity magazine assault weapon to Joe Q Citizen not just banning bump stocks
1194 2018-02-28 20:14:16 I predict @DICKS stocks start to tank and you declare bankruptcy in a few years. At the least, many stores will close.
1195 2018-02-28 20:14:05 Trump can write an executive order banning bump stocks, assuming this will work.  But banning assault weapons wont work.  It will either work or wont work in either case.
1196 2018-02-28 20:14:05 and he is personally going to off bump stocks by executive order...courts almost have to say no

1208 2018-02-28 20:13:23 @realDonaldTrump banning bump stocks...
Does that mean you are going to all the hillbillies homes and confiscating the ones already bought??

1212 2018-02-28 20:13:10 LOL, I didn’t miss your point, I just didn’t think it addressed my premise. A weapon that is designed to kill PEOPLE in the most efficient and effective way does not belong outside the military. Nor a weapon that can be easily modified to shoot multiple rounds (bump stocks).

1224 2018-02-28 20:12:25 He’s going to “write out bump stocks with an ex order. No need for legislation !”
1225 2018-02-28 20:12:23 On bump stocks, Trump says he will "write it out" and ban the devices administratively. Congress won't need to include it in their bill, president says
1226 2018-02-28 20:12:21 President Trump just said he's going to "write that out" and use Executive Order to outlaw bump stocks. No Congressional action needed on that issue, he says.
#GunControl
1227 2018-02-28 20:12:19 Trump interrupts Cornyn to say  Congress doesn't have to worry about bump stocks b/c Trump will take care of that.  Ummmm I heard that he can NOT get rid of bump stocks on his own, w/o Congress.  He interrupts Cornyn again & says he wants " a whole bunch of things in the bill".
1228 2018-02-28 20:12:17 Trump implies he's going to ban bump stocks via Executive Order in meeting on school safety. Tells Cornyn to "write that out" of proposed bill
1229 2018-02-28 20:12:17 Someone tell him his EO on bump stocks will be held up in the Courts. So no, you can’t just bypass Congress. Same party that bitched constantly about Obama’s EOs!!!
1230 2018-02-28 20:12:16 Trump keeps talking about "writing out" bump stocks. It's been over a week, where's the Executive Order? #GunControlNow
1231 2018-02-28 20:12:05 At White House school safety/gun meeting Trump vows bump stocks are "gone." "I'm going to write that out. We can do that by executive order." Says "the lawyers" are working on it.
1232 2018-02-28 20:11:58 Thanks @POTUS @realDonaldTrump for saying let's keep "Bump Stocks" out of this. That is an easy fix that doesn't address the larger issue. Well done. #MAGA #CNN #FoxNews #TheLead #FoxAndFriends #NRA #2ndAmendment
1233 2018-02-28 20:11:52 Trump again says he's going to ban bump stocks on his own. Tells members of Congress not to worry about it.
1234 2018-02-28 20:11:48 Trump says he is focusing on essentially writing bump stocks out with executive action.
1235 2018-02-28 20:11:43 Trump tells lawmakers at the White House that he is "going to write the bump stocks, essentially, write it out." He adds, "Shortly, that will be done. ... We will have that done pretty quickly."
1236 2018-02-28 20:11:39 @GOP any gun bill that doesn't include a ban on bump stocks and a ban on assault rifles is a bad bill.
1237 2018-02-28 20:11:39 Bump stocks going away? I’ll believe it when I see it. It’s “something”
1238 2018-02-28 20:11:38 Bump stocks were invented for handicap people that have one arm you going to tell them they’re not allowed to exercise their Second Amendment how many people have been massacred because of bump stocks they’re trying to ban muskets did you know that second amendment under attack
1239 2018-02-28 20:11:36 Stock buybacks happen because stocks are highly undervalued and the business climate promises a better return going forward.
1240 2018-02-28 20:11:35 POTUS also continues to say he will “write out” bump stocks, though it remains to be seen what he means by that exactly.
1241 2018-02-28 20:11:34 Stocks plunged as SLM Corporation unveiled a courageous postage stamp today.
1242 2018-02-28 20:11:30 Pres. Trump stops Sen. Cornyn to make it clear that bump stocks do not need to be part of his bill- it will be "Taken care of separately," says Pres. Trump.
1243 2018-02-28 20:11:29 *TRUMP SAYS SHORTLY BUMP STOCKS `WILL BE GONE'
*TRUMP SAYS HE CAN ADDRESS BUMP STOCKS WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER
1244 2018-02-28 20:11:24 Trump says he's going to make bump-stocks illegal by executive order:

"I'm gonna write that out."
1245 2018-02-28 20:11:24 Trump interrupts Cornyn to say "we can write that out" about bump stocks. (He can't.)
1246 2018-02-28 20:11:20 .@POTUS says he can write an executive order to deal with the bump stock issue.  

Unclear if an EO is enough to ban bump stocks.
1247 2018-02-28 20:11:19 Trump just announced an EO to ban bump stocks. Over Cornyn's head.
1248 2018-02-28 20:11:17 Trump tells senators and members of Congress “you won’t have to worry about bump stocks” and Congress “should focus on other things.” DOJ, meanwhile ….
1249 2018-02-28 20:11:16 Trump tells bipartisan lawmakers he does not want them to have to worry about banning bump stocks. Says he thinks he can do it by executive order soon
1250 2018-02-28 20:11:16 Only in football can we fuck it up so massively, absolute joke
1251 2018-02-28 20:11:16 Trump tells Cornyn he's going to bar bump stocks by executive order. Tells lawmakers at the White House "You won't have to worry about bump stocks"
1252 2018-02-28 20:11:16 Pres Trump says he is going to take care of prohibiting bump stocks, tells lawmakers, "shortly that will be gone...we'll have that done pretty quickly"
1253 2018-02-28 20:11:15 "You won't have to worry about bump stocks," Trump tells lawmakers. "That will be gone"
1254 2018-02-28 20:11:15 NEW: President Trump says lawyers are working on an executive order he will sign to ban bump stocks.
1255 2018-02-28 20:11:14 Trump says the White House lawyers are working on an Executive Order to ban bump stocks
1256 2018-02-28 20:11:14 Trump at televised White House meeting on gun violence says he will ban bump stocks with an executive order and it will be done "pretty quickly."
1257 2018-02-28 20:11:11 POTUS interrupts Cornyn when he talks about bump stock legislation. "I'm gonna write that out." Says he's drafting an executive order to ban bump stocks.
1258 2018-02-28 20:11:09 "You won't have to worry about bump stocks," Trump says to lawmakers.
1259 2018-02-28 20:11:08 EO ELIMINATING BUMP STOCKS- huh.
1260 2018-02-28 20:11:02 Trump just said he'll write an executive order to ban bump stocks
1261 2018-02-28 20:10:35 Excellent! Don't sell assault weapons..NO ONE needs them, period..or Bump stocks..
1262 2018-02-28 20:10:34 Why all these rich people waste their time with their excess capital in hedge funds, income property , stocks, bonds or any of this shit that comes with tax implicatons and various other headaches , I'll never know.
1263 2018-02-28 20:10:22 Shareholders would include 401k’s as it is typical to invest funds in a diverse range of products, including stocks and bonds, in order to limit risk....
1264 2018-02-28 20:10:22 But Hamhuis waived. They waited too long to get him to and the market dried up. FYI A good GM creates a market for their players

Theyve waited too long to sell many of their assets. You ever buy stocks? Any fool can buy. Much tougher to know how to sell when the value is high
1265 2018-02-28 20:10:10 (1/3) It's hard to swallow.. I was born with a fishing rod in one hand and a shotgun in the other.. I was taught a bunch of life lessons that I'll never forget from my father- just like his father & his father before him.. I own many guns including AR15's and even Bump Stocks..
1266 2018-02-28 20:09:53 Underground market will always be there, but people are lazy and easy access is always first choice. Maybe no demand now but rec isn’t legal yet. Wasn’t legal in Cali either and now their short on stocks. You can make your own beer too, but who does? (IMO)
1267 2018-02-28 20:09:46 And you have yet to explain how Trump is owned by the NRA when he is going against them in banning bump stocks and raising the legal age.
1268 2018-02-28 20:09:42 Support the #NRA for life.  You can have bump stocks but gun laws are already on the books for background checks.  In guessing you have never been through the process.  If you outlaw guns only outlaws will have them.  Go ahead and make murder illegal also.  Dumbasses #supportNRA
1269 2018-02-28 20:09:42 Latest @dicks move - "...encouraging lawmakers to enact “common sense gun reform” including bans on assault weapons and bump stocks, raising the age limit to purchase a firearm, and broader universal background checks..." will do little to prevent another #FloridaShooting (1/4) -
1270 2018-02-28 20:09:34 Bump stocks - because you never know when a herd of deer will attack you.
1271 2018-02-28 20:09:30 My stocks’ value went waaaaaay up today 
1272 2018-02-28 20:09:27 So buy the crap out of dividend stocks with some sales growth on sale if rates stay rangebound under 3.4
1273 2018-02-28 20:09:23 Actually, Sulu, President Obama was the best gun salesman in US history. His badmouthing law-abiding firearms owners led to some of the biggest, sustained increases in gun sales ever. Gun stocks actually fell when Trump was elected. More guns has resulted in lower crime rates.
1274 2018-02-28 20:08:57 18 to 21 age raise to own a gun is a red herring, a straw man we can fight over, a bone to throw like bump stocks, won’t solve anything, yet even this they will not give up without a fight @nra

1278 2018-02-28 20:07:59 @RepTerriBryant Very disconcerting that you feel transgender individuals are more of a threat to kids in school than bump stocks.  @Indivisible12th @IndivisibleIL
1279 2018-02-28 20:07:21 Ban assault-style firearms / Raise the minimum age to purchase firearms to 21 / Ban high capacity magazines and bump stocks / Require universal background checks that include relevant mental health information and previous interactions with the law
1280 2018-02-28 20:07:13 "We know there's gonna be some backlash, but we just wanna see our stocks and sales absolutely fucking tank." 

The employees who will lose their jobs as a result of bottomed out sales are gonna be piiiiissed.
1281 2018-02-28 20:07:09 reasonable security. Once a local path is created, I see a surge of US investment. Even though the Stock market is faring well, I think there is a greater potential with Crypto (IE: 30,000% profit with XRP) as opposed to a max of 30% per year with stocks. 5/
1282 2018-02-28 20:07:08 I guess it should be no surprise that someone who posts a "First they came for the bump stocks" version of the Martin Niemöller quote would vehemently defend trophy hunting.

1284 2018-02-28 20:06:52 What you should be asking @dwyerstrategy is whether or not it is a good idea to invest your student loan money into stocks. Also, don't quote someone then not say what was actually said.
1285 2018-02-28 20:06:38 I’m hoping the government makes bump stocks illegal so I can 3D print them

1287 2018-02-28 20:05:18 Bonds also showing less risk to upside & inflation under control. Great for prop stocks
1288 2018-02-28 20:05:12 Come on.. pResident doesn't want to ban bump stocks are anything his NRA handlers tell him not to do... but they have also told him how to do it so it never happens but he can lie and say he did something. Call him out for the right reasons, & not by saying "my" bill. #ImpeachGOP
1289 2018-02-28 20:04:54 Is this the same Jeff Sessions who, after two weeks,  still has no clue if ATF can write a letter reversing its 2010 decision approving bump stocks?
1290 2018-02-28 20:04:50 Wrong. Its the bump stocks. The weapon no different than a rifle.
1291 2018-02-28 20:04:49 Bottom line is to keep it simple; don't get into the weeds. Have a single strategy/goal to start, and master that. Mastering the call buying strategy, or the put writing strategy (both easy) can change your investing for life. But owning stocks remains key, of course.
1292 2018-02-28 20:04:36 The #NRA today clarified their position on bump stocks & other devices that turn legal guns into illegal assault weapons: they are opposed to ANY ban on ANY firearm accessories in #Maryland. Thanks for being reasonable!  #MDpolitics #MDGA18
1293 2018-02-28 20:04:14 Better stop selling all semi auto rifles there all the same and you can buy stocks for pretty much any rifle to be more "assault rifle" like. That's why these laws and banning "assualt rifles" is pointless #AR15
1294 2018-02-28 20:04:12 You are right Sheriff Clarke. The same here I think was Soro's involvement in the Las Vegas  killing and  shootings. Soros and the hotel owner both took out thousands of $ MGM stocks just before the shooting! Looks like they knew beforehand of the shooting + also diff.timelines !

1298 2018-02-28 20:02:20 @realDonaldTrump Why are you trying to play politics with our rights?  Why are you trying to ban bump stocks?  More people are killed by knives annually than by bump stocks EVER.  The only reason is politics.  Stop screwing over your base.  Dems won't vote for you.

1301 2018-02-28 20:02:10 The great state of Illinois, which is up to its eyeballs in debt, is currently in a gun control frenzy. Bump stocks & under 21 "assault weapon" bans are likely to fly through. Those under 21 would have to forfeit the gun within 90 days of passage.
1302 2018-02-28 20:01:17 They must have taken that poll before the NRA made him walk back his comments about bump stocks and ownership age.
1303 2018-02-28 20:00:53 Ban bump stocks and raise the limit for assault rifles to 21 so seniors can’t bring them to school
1304 2018-02-28 20:00:39 So, how about you talk to your Democratic colleagues and come up with some bills that 1) ban assault weapons, 2) create universal background check (no loopholes!) and strengthen our national system for background checks and 3) eliminate the availability of bump stocks?

1308 2018-02-28 19:59:21 Not all guns. Ban people from buying them.  If they are a danger. No gun. If they are on  psych meds. No gun. If they are under psychiatric treatment. No Gun. etc. No More Bump Stocks! No more Large Mags.  There are steps to prevent these tragedies.
1309 2018-02-28 19:58:35 Democrats rally around universal background checks ahead of White House meeting! YOU NEED TO REALLY AROUND MUCH MORE THAN THAT. NO PURCHASE UNDER AGE 21, AND NO BUNT STOCKS. AFTER ALL THIS COULD BE YOUR KID!
1310 2018-02-28 19:57:27 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

1349 2018-02-28 19:46:26 Calm down cupcake assault rifles and bump stocks and maybe your guns because You’re kinda violent!
1350 2018-02-28 19:46:18 Doubt it.  The market place is bigger than that and many dealers are not publicly traded.  If you truly believe that you should be loading up those company stocks. Put your money where your mouth is.

1352 2018-02-28 19:45:53 GOP borrowed $1.5 trillion in order to drop Corp tax rate, which made it tax efficient to repatriate $100s of billions. The repatriated funds are being used primarily for stock buybacks and dividends. 10% of richest U.S. households own 84% of stocks. You figure it out.

1369 2018-02-28 19:39:39 While we’re talking about firearms stocks today, it seems like a great time to mention that in late 2016, Smith & Wesson made the decision to change its holding name to “American Outdoor Brands” partly out of concerns that being so openly a gun company discouraged active trading.

1382 2018-02-28 19:35:03 The people behind Hogg want total gun ban. In Mass. they banned bump stocks, only a few turned in and you can get life in prison if caught with one. Life in prison for a bump stock? What's happening to our country? Lil liberal controlled dictators like Hogg?
1383 2018-02-28 19:33:57 And DICK's stocks rose at the opening bell, after announcing this decision.  May be a key indicator that people are finally fed up and like seeing people trying to do something about it.  YAY!

1388 2018-02-28 19:32:52 While stating that “we support and respect the 2nd Amendment,” Dick’s urged Congress for a national ban on assault-style firearms, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, and a minimum age of 21 for firearms sales. “Thoughts and prayers aren’t enough" said a Dick's rep.

1392 2018-02-28 19:32:37 @BassProShops @Cabelas I’m a gun owner but I believe in sensible restrictions. Nobody needs bump stocks, high cap mags & assault weapons. Limit other gun sales to over 21.

And also, how much mental gymnastics do u need to do to think the guy trying to ban bump stocks and increase the age limit on purchasing a gun is an NRA puppet?
1401 2018-02-28 19:29:38 @WarrenBuffett yo i have a few questions about stocks
1402 2018-02-28 19:29:03 It should not be a requirement, but a choice on the part of each teacher. I'm trained to operate a gun, but someone who isn't will obviously be scared or intimidated by them. Yes, ban assault rifles and bump stocks. Increase gun regulations. But also, give them methods of defense
1403 2018-02-28 19:28:58 Rep. David Harris says it is an “absolute disgrace” that months after the mass shooting in Las Vegas, there is not a ban on bump stocks. Gun restriction advocates observing the House respond with cheers.
1404 2018-02-28 19:28:05 Dicks just took a stand to help the fight for gun reform. @big5since55 where's your action? As a former employee and customer I ask you to remove all semi-automatic firearms and bump stocks from sale at your stores. Please do what @DICKS is doing or you will lose lots of business
1405 2018-02-28 19:27:33 GOP Rep. David Harris said it is a "disgrace" bump stocks weren't banned after the Las Vegas shooting. Draws cheers from the gallery.
1406 2018-02-28 19:27:20 Oh no do not get me wrong. I support our right to bare arms but do we need assult rifles or guns that can kill 17 people in the span of 6 minutes? The constitution says nothing about ARs or bump stocks.
1407 2018-02-28 19:26:42 GOP Rep. David Harris gets applause when he says it's a "disgrace" bump stocks have yet to be banned in wake of Las Vegas shooting.
1408 2018-02-28 19:26:16 My take: since the stocks are so cheap % undervalued - two diff things- I would never put a tight stop to my orders. Reason being that if a stock is to appreciate 500% or more, what’s the difference of racking in just 480?

Always be mindful of the big picture! $DMCAF $ONCYF
1409 2018-02-28 19:26:10 Assault weapons and bump stocks I have no problem with but I do however think we need a define what  an assault weapon is. a fully automatic weapon fires continuously with one pull of the trigger until the clip is empty a simi automatic fires One shot per pull or the trigger
1410 2018-02-28 19:25:58 Just doesn’t seem to be a reason for assault rifles or for that matter bump stocks @Walmart . #BanAssaultRifles #bumpstocks #belikedick #StopSellingAR15sWalmart

1412 2018-02-28 19:25:32 HB 1467 is the first gun bill up for debate in House. It would put a ban on bump stocks and trigger cranks.
1413 2018-02-28 19:25:27 In the Illinois House: The first of today's gun bills is under discussion, a proposal to ban bump stocks and trigger cranks. #twill

1416 2018-02-28 19:23:59 so banning bump stocks would be the answer :) and banning semi-autos is wrong too because my Glock 19 is semi-auto and its a handgun #GunEducation
1417 2018-02-28 19:23:56 I'm also okay with banning bump stocks and background checks on private sales. Most gun owners are. We're just fearful of omnibus bills and giving an inch and people taking a mile

1429 2018-02-28 19:21:26 Yeah, stocks also don't make sense to me. They bob up and down in a inscrutable (to me) manor. The only reliable bet there is index funds.

Is there a coin coin?
1430 2018-02-28 19:21:14 Lose the bump stocks, and raise the age to 21, no need to ban any guns.
I have a SEMI-AUTOMATIC shotgun that is no worse than an AR-15.

1438 2018-02-28 19:19:09 Oil stays at this level and the dollar stays low this inversion would have a hard time happening but oil falling and stocks just having any pull back together with 2's rising this year could get you that inversion and it won't mean a recession next year
1439 2018-02-28 19:18:59 Hubmart on Adeola Odeku stocks cheeses and ting. I think the Spar there does too.
1440 2018-02-28 19:18:41 I could care less about bump stocks but I believe that raising the age to purchase you should also raise the age to enlist in the service. Old enough to die for your country old enough to buy guns!!!!!
1441 2018-02-28 19:18:10 He's had an actual town hall where people of all sides got a fair voice.  He's going to eventually ban bumb stocks or any mod that turns regular guns to automatic.  What have the democrats done?  They controlled all 3 branches,  AND 60 votes in the Senate not too long ago.
1442 2018-02-28 19:18:07 As far as bump stocks..outlawing them won’t do much because people can make their own. Those don’t affect me because I don’t need or want one of those lol
1443 2018-02-28 19:17:57 I'm not saying he didn't have bump stocks for an AR 15. But watch the Vegas video. Way more than 30 rounds in a row. That's a belt fed weapon. Not a magazine. And he  fired too quickly. Not a bump stock
1444 2018-02-28 19:17:31 ,,,I'm seeing a lot of paper in the dandruff stocks.
1445 2018-02-28 19:17:20 Same reason as choosing IBM stocks over Honda stocks.
1446 2018-02-28 19:16:52 OK, you're the immigration authority.  Trump could cure cancer and people would be pissed their pharmaceutical stocks took a hit.  Have a good day. It might be helpful to read up on immigration.
1447 2018-02-28 19:16:32 In other words, I don't support bump stocks, but at the same time, I don't support Trump just making crap up.

Let's do it right.
Congress needs to take action, including hearings.

Now about how the Dickey Amendment is being used to choke the truth from the discussion...
1448 2018-02-28 19:16:09 My thoughts & prayers to you for that huge drop in your stocks!! Yuge, bigly even!!

Those are just words.  Put those words into action and ban semiautomatic weapons, expanded magazines, bump stocks.  Do you really care about God’s children?
1454 2018-02-28 19:14:16 So if the bump stocks are legal, as suggested by the ATF, then Congress needs to act, and Trump should sign that action into law.  It is abhorrent (against "Rule of Law") for Trump to suggest that he'll unilaterally take action.
1455 2018-02-28 19:13:58 How about some "common sense" gun laws, Paul?  Even many in the @GOP want this.  Background checks, banning bump stocks?  STOP with the "window dressing."  Your fear of the @NRA will cost you in November!

1458 2018-02-28 19:13:19 Traditionally, 10:1 up days are identified with NYSE volume data. However, the rising number of non-common stocks has increased the chances of potential distortions. We are now using a multi-cap composite to determine 10-to-1 up days.
1459 2018-02-28 19:13:06 Great Call @DDS_DocHoliday on EQT.  Well warned... it's very easy to get swept up in the hype around some of these stocks.

1464 2018-02-28 19:11:55 Bump stocks? Duh?  The weapons themselves performed fine, Following the Vietnam war, the military reexamined their use of the rifles in combat. During this evaluation, it was determined that firing on full auto past three rounds largely resulted in a complete waste of ammunition.

1470 2018-02-28 19:09:54 @NRA @realDonaldTrump  Banning rate of fire devices like bump stocks to curb shootings is like trying to cure alcoholism with a law that tells people to drink slower.
1471 2018-02-28 19:09:34 When legislators have to discuss things, hold hearings, do studies after a tragedy like #MSD either they don’t really want to help OR they are not connected to the culture they claim to represent. Bump stocks, age limits— none of this should be a surprise. None.

b) #WTI was trading @ ~95$/bbl vs today @ ~ 63$/bbl

1474 2018-02-28 19:08:01 Silly argument: 

1) Assault weapon is a made-up term. All weapons are assault weapons.

We can use any term you like. The end result will be the same, a ban on semi-automatic guns, bump stocks and any other weapons of war. The time for silly arguments is done. #GunControlNow
1475 2018-02-28 19:07:47 I literally have 5 sources of income and stocks. Don’t ask me why I have what I have because all I’ll say is by minding my own fucking business. Now to work on the 6th source of income hmmm 
1476 2018-02-28 19:07:28 $CEI - started my position here with 13k. setting up nicely with big volume and history of being a multiway runner - reversal off a doji. Do your DD before making any buys. But I like this play personally.

1478 2018-02-28 19:06:37 @FLGovScott They are schools, not prison. The state needs to stop selling assault weapons, raise the age limit, and definitely stop selling lock stocks.
1479 2018-02-28 19:06:01 A question my mind keeps gnawing on is, how is inflation being measured correctly if it's excluding the cost of ownership? What would the CPI be if it included the price of stocks and commodity markets? Is there such a measure taken? @StephanieKelton @billy_blog @wbmosler

1481 2018-02-28 19:05:32 The only thing wrong with the economy is wall street firms scamming private investors/IRAs by fraudulantly shorting stocks with earning's reports(most of which are great), then mass selling their client's stock to bank profits for themselves. Complete SCAM.
1482 2018-02-28 19:05:28 That’s because the .@NRA has agreed to ban bump stocks but not assault rifles.  This should not be a compromise.  Weapons of war do not belong in the hands of the public.
1483 2018-02-28 19:05:15 Cash, stocks & bonds - not an issue.
Depreciable assets - cost minus depreciation.
Land - I'm sure at least one state has figured this out already. Decide on a method.
Intellectual property - should only be taxed if purchased, at which case, value at cost (subsidizes innovation).
1484 2018-02-28 19:04:43 The closer we are to legalization the less details can be left to imagination to pump. Might be time for numbers to talk. These stocks have ALL been pumping so many times in the last few years, can it keep going on forever
1485 2018-02-28 19:04:40 $fat on the come up. The trolls will say what they say but in the end I haven't seen one of them have the balls to call any stocks.

1487 2018-02-28 19:04:20 Budget film stocks review/comparisons - something along the lines what to buy when in the mood for a bit of messing around - Arista, Kentmere, Foma (though it seems to be the same thing as Arista) or something else. Or everyday colour film - AgfaVista vs Xperia vs Kodak Gold...?

1493 2018-02-28 19:02:38 This is true, if they buy back outstanding shares the stock price goes up.  The stock holders own the company so they're first.  If you own a 401K or a roth IRA or just a brokerage account you also benefit. These investment vehicles are full of these stocks.
1494 2018-02-28 19:02:06 @CndStockTrader what are some good Cobalt stocks? All the ones I found only recently started trading...don't like those ones.

1504 2018-02-28 19:00:43 Stockings and suspenders are a warm weather habit or open fire hearth with fluffy rug. Have to make do with baggy pjs oversized jumper thermal stocks and messy hair.
1505 2018-02-28 19:00:04 I hear socks stocks are the future! 
1506 2018-02-28 18:59:49 I am done arguing with you but no,  until assault weapons and bump stocks are banned (both already are in my State), no, gun laws are not adequate.  Have a good day.
1507 2018-02-28 18:59:41 IS BLUEZELLE about to pump again?WTH? Might be a coin worth grabbing up or at the least put on speculation/watch list.

1512 2018-02-28 18:57:49 Sod that. I'm getting my stocks of single malt topped up.
1513 2018-02-28 18:57:39 And don’t forget to issue some bump stocks to each classroom. Most animals do not have opposable thumbs, so pulling a trigger would be difficult for them.
1514 2018-02-28 18:57:06 gonna get rid of all this crap...use the storage bins in the yard I had built to house my fireball stocks
1515 2018-02-28 18:55:10 And as a result the village stocks and pillory will not be available. Flogging will still take place instead. The fruit and veg market has a lot to answer for.
1516 2018-02-28 18:55:00 For everyone's sake I sure hope that this increase in volume and upward movement in a lot of small and medium cap stocks is a sign that we have bottomed out and are starting a new trend upwards. Time will tell but I'm optimistic.
1517 2018-02-28 18:54:59 Very useful for pumping and dumping Cannabis stocks. In case customers stoned when you tweet.
1518 2018-02-28 18:54:25 No, savers have to spend the savings on investments like stocks to help economic growth. So hodling bitcoin does not drive economic investment.  Besides, technology is advancing so fast, capital is no longer needed. Classical economic foundations are no longer valid.
1519 2018-02-28 18:54:05 Right. However, if the weapon had been an AR-15…well, I think you get the idea. Let's ban military weapons of mass destruction like bump stocks and AR's in the U.S.
1520 2018-02-28 18:53:46 CONGRATULATIONS to the U.S A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people thank you Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks Enjoy I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved Enjoy Today

1522 2018-02-28 18:53:25 Great then let's make them safer yet. We have laws despite the fact people still break the law. Banning guns to those under 21. Background check, banning bump stocks etc can make schools safer still!

1525 2018-02-28 18:52:29 I would say not- not late at all. A high percentage of Doc’s ideas on  early bio nano stocks turn Med out to be 5-10 baggers in a few years. I think both $DMCAF and $ONCYF  belong to that group.
1526 2018-02-28 18:52:10 Better yet: Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, high capacity magazines, fix the background check loopholes, grow a pair while you’re at it, and stand up to the bloodthirsty NRA overlords.
1527 2018-02-28 18:52:02 One thing I’ve seen and that article points out clearly is that the wealth gap won’t be fixed until we start passing down assets to our children. A fully paid off house/ a retirement account/ stocks & bonds. All these things give young adults a head start at building wealth.

1530 2018-02-28 18:50:05 Just to clarify...I like to place bets on price and volume breakouts  whic can occur on intraday time frame. The OR (open range) is a good criteria and like to be above that. This method allows an entry into stocks that are climbing rapidly on the daily/weekly charts.

1535 2018-02-28 18:48:06 Wait -- companies are buying back their stock? Don't companies issue stocks to get money (sort of like going to bank to get a loan?)? They want to bring back ownership within the company and not have others own company?
1536 2018-02-28 18:48:05 give it time, the market will readjust and stocks will go up

1538 2018-02-28 18:47:34 The facts are: he has already moved to ban bump stocks, is looking at raising the age of purchase, increasing background checks, meeting with Law Makers today to discuss other options. What more do you expect right nowmm

1544 2018-02-28 18:43:13 Like Bump Stocks! Start with a small measure, like Magazine size, required firearm certification or ammunition tax increase. Strong efforts to seem like a must, but come off as extreme and lead to support for NRA.

1549 2018-02-28 18:41:07 An M4 is not an AR15. I would say, how about banning "bump-stocks" which effectively turn a semi-auto rifle into full auto? There's no need for them, period. How about not allowing civilians to be able to buy ridiculous 60 or 100-round capacity magazines? No need for them either.
1550 2018-02-28 18:41:00 An overvalued property market, increased deficit spending, rising interest rates, and volatile oil prices do not bode well for the Canadian economy. Definitely a red flag going forward. @EconGlobal #Canada #Commodities #Trudeau #Markets #stocks #bonds #dollar
1551 2018-02-28 18:40:47 The NRA is not producing specifics of workable solutions. It just blocks everything, including reasonable measures like an age limit for buying guns, banning bump stocks, closing gun show and internet sales loopholes of the background check system, and red flag laws. #NRABoycott

1553 2018-02-28 18:39:40 the proposed legislation you refer to will never pass as is, issue is so partisan there will be a lot of wrangling on both sides before laws are passed. Semi autos will not get outright banned, likely start with banning b*stocks, raising rifle buying age, better background checks

1556 2018-02-28 18:37:55 There are many types of semiautomatic rifles. Some are designed like military style rifles & others less aggressively designed with wooden stocks. Regardless of the design, most semiautomatic rifles are used for hunting large game, smaller but quicker varmints & target shooting.
1557 2018-02-28 18:37:42 How fucked up is it that everyone in the country now knows what bump stocks are? I still don't know what half the parts in my car are called.
1558 2018-02-28 18:37:04 Pro tip: if you’re not familiar with the 2d Amendment, stick to talking about stocks
1559 2018-02-28 18:37:01 How will responsible gun owners lose with a ban on AR15s, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines? How will they lose with universal background checks?
1560 2018-02-28 18:36:31 I hear your sentiment, but index funds, by definition, own the S&P 500 stocks. So it's not fair to start demanding removal of a stock on moral grounds. Better you find a non-index fund that has more flexibility.
1561 2018-02-28 18:36:21 I don't understand why you disagree with common sense gun control measures, though.  Mental health checks, background checks, closing loopholes, banning bump stocks/large magazines, and banning assault rifles still preserve baseline 2nd amendment rights. 

Agree w/ you re: walls.
1562 2018-02-28 18:36:05 Bonds are exhausted after a near 30 year bull market. Possible trend change after 26 years of consistent gains -- breaking out of downtrend in yields as of late.

Stocks are expensive by any reasonable measure. Could still go higher, but IMO risk outweighs potential reward. 
1563 2018-02-28 18:35:46 £100K was the projected value of the fund had the shares not been sold. We reported the facts of Mr Eddom's story as a public interest cautionary tale, and it's up to the reader to decide whether his treatment (and these contracts) are fair or not.
1564 2018-02-28 18:35:06 And one important reason why assault weapons and bump stocks aren’t necessary. Thank you for making our point!
1565 2018-02-28 18:35:03 You can’t say that. It’s the gun of choice for virtually all of the school shootings. Get rid of it. Get rid of bump stocks, cranks, and all the unnecessary mods that turn these psychos into mass murderers

1581 2018-02-28 18:25:36 Irony is the the NRA also supports gun control. Like banning bump stocks. There are many different degrees of gun control just like their are many different opinions on those degrees. I would think at least 90% support gun control in some form.
1582 2018-02-28 18:25:18 Given the cold weather/impending blizzard I'm assuming we are going nowhere soon.  I've replenished stocks and have enough booze to last 3 weeks (allowing for a margin of error this seems the minimum stock).  I may not survive but hypothermia & dehydration are not major worries

1593 2018-02-28 18:22:06 It makes a bit more sense to prohibit some accessories and features and detachable stocks, and high capacity magazines because if you save 100, you want people to then buy pistols and shotguns which will kill thousands and say, “good job!

1597 2018-02-28 18:21:16 I meant trade and invest in stocks "The right thing" is maximize shareholder value. That's not an opinion. That's a legal fact for a publicly traded company like DKS.

1600 2018-02-28 18:20:06 A couple good points here but...are bump stocks part of the 2ndA? Are simi-automatic weapons? Is access to an assault style weapon at 18yo more than the life of a child? Maybe it is, I'll read it again. And yea, they are making a political statement, they're allowed to do that.
1601 2018-02-28 18:20:04 Hey @NRA
A few things (thread)
1. We don't want to "take your guns" and "infringe on your rights". We want to take away MILITARY GRADE RIFLES AND BUMP STOCKS and made it harder for people on things like a NO FLY LIST to get guns on this country.
1602 2018-02-28 18:19:33 I had a dream today that my stocks gets skyrocketed and i am in gain of 68k but in my dream itself i was aware that this might be a dream and this is not going to happen !  Life is at such avastha that dreams are also having reality check !
1603 2018-02-28 18:19:21 99 stocks?
1604 2018-02-28 18:19:03 No veterans who recognize the in close devastation an AR-15 on auto spews. Ban the bump stocks, multi-load count on magazines to 4 or 6 and make it a crime to own.  Children, very real targets, are more important than deer. Guilty sent to Afghanistan.
1605 2018-02-28 18:19:02 $intc and $mu my two favorite stocks. withstanding market selloffs, you have to get some exposure to these during these times. $mu also reports in a few weeks (3/22/18) which btw have also pre-released earnings estimates above the consensus range
1606 2018-02-28 18:18:54 Restrictions on bump stocks, high-capacity magazines, increasing age requirements for purchasing firearms...
1607 2018-02-28 18:18:53 That’s the price increase. Tickets will be available till the conference dates or till stocks last :)
1608 2018-02-28 18:18:25 I wish "I own stocks" was like a casual way to admit you're equipped for BDSM and not an overt way of exclaiming your economic status.
1609 2018-02-28 18:18:20 #stocks  Like to time the market for when it's best to commit funds?  Nothing beats a war, a depression, or an invasion for pigging out on cheap, but great companies.
1610 2018-02-28 18:18:19 No ONE WANTS TO REPEAL THE 2ND AMENDMENT!!!
THE BAN REQUEST IS FOR ASSAULT WEAPONS & BUMP STOCKS FROM BEING SOLD.
Expanded background checks
Up purchasing age to 21
IS AN ASSAULT RIFLE WORTH
EVEN 1 LIFE? CHILD OR ADULT? THEIR SMILE, LAUGHTER, LOVE FAMILY, FRIENDS!!!
IS IT???
1611 2018-02-28 18:18:15 This article says that “weapons are more accurate” when not using burst or full auto.

Does that mean the Times is cool with bump stocks?
1612 2018-02-28 18:18:09 I hate being on the side of the Koch brothers but I don't just disagree with someone 100% if I don't "like" them.  On this topic I do agree with them and it can have a huge impact to $MJ stocks.
1613 2018-02-28 18:16:49 @JohnCornyn as your constituent, I want you to pass legislation banning large semi-automatic rifles, bump stocks and high-capacity magazines (no civilian needs those), raising the legal age for buying firearms and having universal background checks.
1614 2018-02-28 18:16:28 I bought stocks in Ricola!
1615 2018-02-28 18:16:20 Nice try, but “calling on the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) to immediately review whether these devices comply with federal law” does constitute being in favor of banning bump stocks.
1616 2018-02-28 18:16:06 I think that you are a prime candidate to pick your own stocks, per your own ethical criteria. Start with VTSAX or VFIAX holdings - then eliminate those you don't like. Easy peezy ;-)
1617 2018-02-28 18:16:02 Last filing was almost before I was born
1618 2018-02-28 18:15:25 Sort of like how they HAD to ban bump stocks despite not knowing what they are or do or the fact that people who know what they are said they never use them anyway.
1619 2018-02-28 18:15:22 Until there stocks drop,  then we'll see what they do.
1620 2018-02-28 18:14:52 So now that #stash is letting you buy single stocks can you still buy partial of that stock or do you have to buy the whole thing
1621 2018-02-28 18:14:11 Listened , only thing which surprised me was that he himself is admitting he was holding lot of low quality stocks I.e DHFl , being a PMS provider how can he afford to even buy these stocks after all he is custodian of someone’s else money
1622 2018-02-28 18:13:25 Why don't you do away with the bump stocks high capacity magazines silencers and all the accessories for an assault rifle. I believe that every law-abiding American should own an assault rifle if they want but not the accessories that's for killing. Common Sense man,

1632 2018-02-28 18:10:55 Was this like the dinner the @NRA had with @realDonaldTrump after he said he wanted to ban bump stocks? Which of course now he’s walked back because it went against the @NRA ? #firstofitskindforsure
1633 2018-02-28 18:10:49 I have recently found out that it is true about the AR-15’s. It is easy to get. I’m not a gun owner so I assumed there were a lot more checks before you could qualify for a weapon. I also found out that some people buy the upper, lower and stocks on line and assemble it themselve
1634 2018-02-28 18:09:55 We have a large toys r us just by us. 

Bland store, not revamped sine it opened, store far too large, frequent out of stocks, sky high prices and a really dire website.

It’s not rocket science.
1635 2018-02-28 18:09:38 I was reading along, until you spewed BS.  Nothing legal, bump stocks included, can shoot 10 rounds/second.  My guns primary purpose is to guard me and my family, God forbid I have to use it to shoot someone.
1636 2018-02-28 18:09:36 As someone who was there when EURCHF and AUDJPY correlated hugely with stocks, it is ultra weird to see a vast implosion on carry and barely a nudge on stocks at all.

1638 2018-02-28 18:09:22 You guys give up your AR-15’s, bump stocks and assault rifles and we’ll give up The Clinton’s deal?
1639 2018-02-28 18:09:06 Dick's Sporting Goods raised min age for all gun sales to 21, won't sell high-capacity mags, nor bump stocks. It's a start.
1640 2018-02-28 18:08:52 Supply and demand of a single item in a massive market across hundreds of stores is not going to affect stocks in a meaningful way at all. Seems like you need to take Econ 101 before claiming that others don't understand supply and demand.
1641 2018-02-28 18:08:47 Can be said for all small transactions usually processed via Credit Card. Visa and MC stocks are long term bearish for sure.

1648 2018-02-28 18:07:10 Stocks give up gains and trade near unchanged.
1649 2018-02-28 18:07:05 yes, stocks have gone higher as rates have risen, but at what point do higher rates become a drag on stock prices?
1650 2018-02-28 18:06:55 I'm just concerned about wine and crisp stocks!!! X 
1651 2018-02-28 18:06:54 An assault rifle would be an AK-47 which the milatary uses and is not sold to the public. Bump stocks for semiautomatic rifles are not approved by the NRA. 66% of mass shootings have occurred with single shot hand guns.
1652 2018-02-28 18:06:41 Does that include all Simi auto rifles with wood stocks? After all, an AR15 is the exact same thing just with an ugly stock.

You're a sad little man to attempt to degrade our children for a pay check. 
1666 2018-02-28 18:00:14 you can ban bump stocks, assault rifles, or anything you want, but unless people give them up or there are insanely severe punishments for keeping them, nothing will change. its the gun mentality ingrained in their culture that needs to change 2/2

1669 2018-02-28 17:58:31 Combine that with some common-sense stuff -- banning bump stocks/large magazines/etc., requiring background checks for all sales, etc. -- that'll do much more to stop mass shootings than pinning this on "crazy."  

Angry, biased, violent, etc. often isn't about mental health.

1672 2018-02-28 17:58:13 Please be sure you are completely informed about the firearms and devices before deciding whether to ban them or not. Bump stocks do NOT make a gun fully automatic. "AR" in AR-15 does NOT mean "assault rifle. It's Armalite Rifle, manufacturer's initials.
1673 2018-02-28 17:58:05 Lol, The NRA favors banning bum stocks so that they can avoid real gun control legislation. Trump supported raising the age, but the NRA didn’t, and now he hasn’t talked about it at all. He is a corporate whore to the NRA. #NRABloodMoney #BoycottNRA
1674 2018-02-28 17:58:01 If your weapon requires both hands to steady your aim, you are no longer defending yourself, you are hunting. Nobody needs high capacity magazines and bump stocks to hunt.
1675 2018-02-28 17:58:01 It depends on the rifle. And like I said bump stocks don't turn semi automatic rifle into a full automatic one. Don't work. And I don't think they were actually used in Las Vegas. The rate of fire was too high.
1676 2018-02-28 17:57:48 $LG.V has taken a hit, along with all of the pot stocks,, perhaps an even bigger hit than most,, but only because liars, such as yourself,, with your own personal agenda, have chosen to bash the stock to a level that you want to buy into.  That's when the tune changes!

1691 2018-02-28 17:53:49 Has he banned bump-stocks? No. He said he would, but he hasn't.
1692 2018-02-28 17:53:17 Nobody has said banned ... just background checks and no need for things like bump-stocks

1695 2018-02-28 17:51:04 Great!Mr. President thank you for banning bump stocks.Please put at the top of the infrastructure spending priorities electronic access control at every door at schools, metal detectors, bullet proof glass, adding multiple exits to each room so students aren’t trapped, door stops

1713 2018-02-28 17:47:44 Please explain this. You say Trump is owned by the NRA. Yet Trump is going against the NRA in wanting to ban bump stocks and raise age limits for buying certain weapons.
   So how exactly does the NRA own him?
1714 2018-02-28 17:47:43 $MDXG These short and distort scams are all the same.  Interesting is that twitter has made these scams easier for the short sellers, who bet against stocks, to post negative comments with RT.

1717 2018-02-28 17:46:36 Want to talk about red flags? The Las Vegas shooter bought 33 guns, bump stocks, and thousands of rounds of ammunition in the year before the shooting. NRA backed laws prohibit the government from tracking & spotting these patterns.
1718 2018-02-28 17:46:19 Guess you all wrong since he banning bump stocks..sucks for you to think he is owned by anyone...

- Bump-stocks

1722 2018-02-28 17:45:51 £3k from a £100k pension fund... But it was worth £50k? 

Had a client panicking about this today and i felt story disingenuous. Lots of emotive words. 'nest egg raided', 'valuable shares', 'draconian', 'lucrative returns'. 

No wonder people so often misinformed about pensions.
1723 2018-02-28 17:45:09 No law has been offered re bump stocks...it should be an easy out and if it was put forward it would pass...problem is it is not only thing that should be done.
1724 2018-02-28 17:45:02 Toujours par le bas ! Sauf pour certains, qui touchent des stocks/options, des parachutes dorés, des exils fiscaux, des niches fiscales..etc
1725 2018-02-28 17:44:48 As one myself, I can say I am not.  We already have tight restrictions on all automatic weapons (which is what an assault rifle is). We agree on bump-stocks and backgrounds. Most of us do.  Age to 21 sounds nice, but do we think this killer becomes a saint at 21? Just delays it.
1726 2018-02-28 17:44:26 you have enough patience, when everyone was trying to sell 10 days back (correction time+ pnb fraud time) you were/are patiently hold the stocks-  also invested 25L on Budget day.
1727 2018-02-28 17:44:01 And are you in Favor of Trump trying to eliminate bump stocks ?  Are you in favor of him raising the min age to buy guns to 21 ?

1733 2018-02-28 17:40:08 @DICKS Thank you for stopping the sale of assault weapons. Use your power and lobby other business owners to force congress to enact common sense gun laws. No automatic weapons, no high velocity rounds, no bump stocks - and background checks for all - every purchase regardless.

1736 2018-02-28 17:39:29 Good job @DICKS.  Hope more retailers will follow your lead.  Gun control doesn't mean no guns; hunting and personal protection don't mean large magazines or bump stocks. I will go out of my way to patronize your stores & will suggest others do the same.
1737 2018-02-28 17:39:28 I'm all for teachers having rocket launchers too. Insurance companies being able to sell rocket launcher insurance helps stimulate the economy. Band-aid stocks will sky rocket faster than cryptocurrency. If fire is the greatest invention, more fire is better.

1746 2018-02-28 17:37:45 They need more specific language. Banning these stocks is great, but there are plenty of other products on the market that alter semi auto weapons to mimic full auto rates of fire.
1747 2018-02-28 17:36:53 When did I specifically say AR15? Even the article doesn't mention it specifically. You do realize tactical stocks and grips can go on numerous types of weapons.  Even bolt action rifles and shotgun can have scary black plastic...

1751 2018-02-28 17:36:02 Assault-style weapons, high capacity ammunition, bump stocks do not belong in the hands of civilians. bullying, mental health urgencies, physical safety of school infrastructure matter too. But i resolve feverishly the solution must include reasonable gun limitations. #BoycottNRA
1752 2018-02-28 17:35:40 So, that tells us nothing about what you personally are going to do. Military style assault weapons w/high capacity magazines & bump stocks need to be banned. Historical data shows this works. You are in bed with an organization that has aligned itself with our adversary.
1753 2018-02-28 17:35:39 Yes. Property stocks mostly.
1754 2018-02-28 17:34:44 As stocks have rallied off their 2/9 intraday lows, the yield curve has flattened. Would like to see that steepen. $DJIA $SPY $IWM $EEM $EFA
1755 2018-02-28 17:34:15 It's a semi automatic hi muzzle velocity weapon that bump stocks and trigger cranks convert to same rof as full auto. Military also uses 1/2
1756 2018-02-28 17:33:47 Why do your pics have the magazine out of the Rugers?  Surely you knew that.  Was it to make it look more like a hunting rifle?  Do you realize how many mass shootings used the AR 15?  its also very customizable, but surely you knew that right? bumps stocks, larger clips..etc
1757 2018-02-28 17:33:39 yep people save others everyday because of guns,but the left wont report that, time to buy ur bump stocks and assualt rifles oooooooooooooooora

1761 2018-02-28 17:33:01 I'm not claiming to know the answers. What I do know is we have a problem that other first world countries aren't facing. We're alone in this shooting epidemic. But maybe stricter regulations on semi automatics. Universal background checks. Ban bump stocks and extended mags.

1763 2018-02-28 17:32:14 A ban on assault rifles and bump stocks should be an easy one.  Don't you think?
1764 2018-02-28 17:32:03 All those Libatard companies like @Delta @united etc, etc. will go the way of Star coffee. Watch their stocks struggle and drop!
1765 2018-02-28 17:31:45 Do some research. Semi automatics are as fast as bump stocks. I bet with your little tweeting fingers you could mow down students with an AR 15 faster than anybody! You're the best at everything arntcha!

1767 2018-02-28 17:31:14 On a call with my investment manager today he says U.S. stocks are fully/over valued; he recommended increasing my focus on foreign markets. I said "yes"
1768 2018-02-28 17:31:07 Also don't think that bump stocks aren't the only stab that legislators can take at the problem. I mean Trump directly blamed mental illness, yet as I'm sure you've seen mentioned, rolled back regulations that made it much harder for those suffering from them to buy guns.
1769 2018-02-28 17:31:04 Teacher comes they would also be shot along with all children in classroom. The gunman/women has to be caught at entry point. Armed security at entrances would work better. Metal detectors and not selling assault rifles or bump stocks.
1770 2018-02-28 17:30:20 Good for them. Ammo too? Accessories like Bump stocks? Are they also getting rid of everything associated with these weapons of war?
1771 2018-02-28 17:29:58 @Steve_Moore It's a nice move.  Just see these type as too high of a risk.  I almost always stay away from stocks trading under $5.00
1772 2018-02-28 17:29:41 What stocks should I invest in? Asking for me
1773 2018-02-28 17:29:05 Not really - a fully automatic weapon is clearly a weapon designed for war.  An AR is not.  As an ardent supporter of the 2A, I support this automatic weapon ban.  Would also likely support a ban on bump stocks.  Will not support raising the age to purchase any rifle.
1774 2018-02-28 17:29:02 How about I’m not afraid of the NRA we need to raise that 21 we need to stop the bump stocks right now I’ll take care of that until launch came out with a whole new attitude so it is true the last person in your ear is Who you go with That’s not leadership that $$$ talking to u

1782 2018-02-28 17:26:16 as they call you to task. You do take a substantial amount from the NRA and since their money to politicians have increased mass shooting incidents by not banning the ARs, bump stocks and other weapons of mass destruction. Check your hands there is blood on them.
1783 2018-02-28 17:26:08 @Dicks Setting a shining example and banning automatic weapons and bump stocks and raising the age to 21. Just like that. Just like that.

1793 2018-02-28 17:23:34 "Shall not be infringed. . ."  Word defined as restrict, limit, curb or act as to limit. Seems clear to me.  If you ban the AR, you need to ban all semi automatic weapons. It's just a long version of a 9MM.  I predict there will be VERY small adjustments like bump stocks.

1803 2018-02-28 17:22:02 Funny, I just watched that again a week ago :) Used to get called by penny stock brokers from NYC in the 90's. Probably a little exaggerated, but fun movie. But aside the fraud part, it was a lot like being a stockbroker in the late 90's, but with well-known tech stocks.

1806 2018-02-28 17:21:32 Any gun don't care what you want to call it that is remotely close to shooting faster or gives the effect that bump stocks do should be banned immediately. There is no use for them for hunting or anything else except war or for killing a mass number of people aka massacres.

1809 2018-02-28 17:20:53 I don’t agree with a lot of shit with trump. Only a few things I agree on. But he’s taking a step forward with gun laws. Banning bump stocks. All that stuff. What did our last president do?? And you are bashing him for trying? Cmon.
1810 2018-02-28 17:20:40 Rest In Peace your stocks. This will hurt the company as it should.
1811 2018-02-28 17:20:26 "The retailer is urging lawmakers to enact “common sense gun reform” by passing legislation that raises the minimum age to buy a gun to 21, to ban AR-15s and semi-automatic weapons as well as bump stocks."

1825 2018-02-28 17:16:11 Bump stocks are a mechanical attachment that make the rifle fire automatically in every sense the mechanisms for an M-16 or AK-47 capture energy to chamber another round without an additional trigger pull. So what’s not fully automatic about the bump stock/semi auto combination?
1826 2018-02-28 17:16:00 @royalenfield take the bike back and replace it with the new version. Don't push the old version to clear your stocks. Trupti Motors Bhubaneswar has cheated us. Erodes the faith in a trusted brand. Awaiting your revert !!
1827 2018-02-28 17:14:46 I’m if the cold calculated opinion that the bump stocks actually saved lives. I’ve fired full auto as I’m sure you have. Even from prone supported by a bipod the accuracy is horrible. But a trained shooter picking his shots with a magnified optic would have owned that crowd.
1828 2018-02-28 17:14:32 Forgive her for she knows not what she says.  Sometimes it boggles the mind what people come up with to validate mass school shooting. Ban assault weapons of war bump stocks etc. from being sold to public,. Make weapons available only for Shooting Range under strict supervision.
1829 2018-02-28 17:14:28 Bump stocks? As an AR owner I’m absolutely for banning bump stocks, they’re dumb, inaccurate & dangerous. Agreed. I’m all for raising purchase age, much stricter gun control & strong enforcement. I hate mass shooters as much as anyone
1830 2018-02-28 17:14:07 Yeah, now is not the time to weaken PERA since it's already floundering.  Unless of course you can "buy low and sell high" with those stocks.  Other than that... shutty.

1832 2018-02-28 17:13:22 I have no problem at all with banning bump stocks or other items that can make a semi-automatic weapon fire like a fully automatic one.
1833 2018-02-28 17:12:57 Rejoinder: We measure Sentiment, a structural, not fundamental, data point. Routinely the FAANGs have the same Sentiment as the ENTIRE Russell 1000. It says these stocks are over-utilized as ETF collateral, a huge market risk factor.
1834 2018-02-28 17:12:17 Yes. Is there an easy way to make sure specific mutual funds don't invest in weapons of war? The TIAA Social Choice Fund, for example. They exclude stocks using a number of "screens" - but don't see a specific exclusion of guns.
1835 2018-02-28 17:12:09 I've booked solid gains on stocks like $ZGNX that fluctuate unpredictably within a range while long-term holders just bob up and down in the tide. If a stock happens to take off for good while your position is relatively small you still win, just not as much.
1836 2018-02-28 17:11:52 Need to meet a nigga who dabbles in stocks
1837 2018-02-28 17:11:34 The AR-15s yes, but the bump-stocks, not selling to anyone over age-21 and not selling high capacity magazines also helps. I don't think anyone is claiming that Dick's banning it alone is going to stop mass shootings, but its a push in the right direction
1838 2018-02-28 17:11:20 Stocks plunged as Automatic Data Processing, Inc. unveiled a shrewd egg today.
1839 2018-02-28 17:10:50 there are so many folk that seem to think a correction in a Bull market will never end. Fact is, they do. Just a month ago everybody was screaming for pot stocks to pullback. Now that they have, everyone saying the bottom is still far away. For long term investors,some great opps
1840 2018-02-28 17:10:46 Spoos 50DMA sits at 2738, Dow's sits at 25310ish...these are the levels to watch closely today IMO. If we manage to close below 'em then selloff could get much worse. However it might provide support but with 3-4 stocks holding the shitshow together i doubt it will last til EOD
1841 2018-02-28 17:10:07 Dick's Sporting Goods is showing more courage than our president and the US Congress. Dick's will:

*Stop the sale of assault-style weapons;
*Stop the sale of high-capacity magazines; 
*Raise the minimum age for all gun sales to 21;
*Continue not to sell bump stocks.

1842 2018-02-28 17:09:43 My stock play
1.Look for good stocks when they are bleeding.
2. Enter small
3. Keep adding when it goes low (****this applies only to large cap)
4. Make sure it pays dividend 
5. Hold for long term.
6. Make profit.
1843 2018-02-28 17:09:15 We all know that once bio stocks have reversed momentum, they will often keep going way past what seems rational. Tranche trading helps capture the irrational portion of the curve without risking all gains. @portefeuillefun almost never closes a position completely.
1844 2018-02-28 17:09:13 BTW, the gun laws that we DO have are not being enforced. How about suggesting that to your Democrats?Republicans have offered to outlaw bump stocks and the left will not proceed.
1845 2018-02-28 17:09:07 But that's a nice environment for the relatively inexpensive value with growth sectors like banks (looking for dips but hard to get) and other areas and special situations.  Though I prefer to avoid the way overvalued hi-flyer stocks & sectors.

1860 2018-02-28 17:04:51 you dont even need a bump stock most of the time just holding the gun the right way can let you shoot faster. THE GUNS CAPABLE of that much power are at fault and what must be addressed, bump stocks just make firing faster easier. It can still be done without them.Its a scapegoat
1861 2018-02-28 17:04:49 You are either ignorant or a hypocrite. Donald trump has recommended banning bump stocks and raising the age to 21: both against the NRA. The kids have done nothing but grand stand and politicized the tragic deaths of 17.

1874 2018-02-28 17:01:02 Folks, the market is in "distribution" not "accumulation" meaning the big holders of stocks are generally selling into strength - but not aggressively. This means upside is limited relying upon retail to push up prices.

1879 2018-02-28 16:59:34 That's what I see, too.   But the institutional appetite for FAANG stocks masks this reality.
1880 2018-02-28 16:59:29 And what is your position on outlawing assault weapons, bump stocks, and adding a lot of other tighter controls? Oh, I almost forgot -- you have to placate the NRA, or no more $$$ for you.
1881 2018-02-28 16:59:05 How come you weird maga ppl always pretend to be knowledgeable about stocks?
1882 2018-02-28 16:59:04 You can actually learn how to fire a semi automatic weapon at the same rate of a bump stock. Bump stocks make it much harder to hit targets
1883 2018-02-28 16:58:56 What are you talking about man they told us bump stocks are bad LOL.
1884 2018-02-28 16:58:36 Background checks & people w violent history get refused. 48 hour waiting period. Required safety training before licensed. Ban AR-15s, bump stocks & like items I know nothing of. AND better access to & coverage of mental healthcare, improved school security w/out added weaponry.
1885 2018-02-28 16:58:32 Nah, the kids are cool and I think are doing it for the right reasons. Democrats scarring gun owner with talk (and only talk) of gun control and the NRA says "they're coming for our guns" and everyone stocks up on heavy weapons. Everyone wins - except the kids.
1886 2018-02-28 16:57:42 I think a court would rule that bump stocks do not meet the "common use" test created by the Heller decision in SCOTUS and are thus not protected by the 2A.

1892 2018-02-28 16:55:21 "We should spit in the face of the #NRA today," says @bradhoylman calling for ban on ownership of bump stocks

#CommonSenseGunLaws 
Your Turn.
Thank you!!! Our kids thank you too.
1899 2018-02-28 16:53:46 Without a definition the term assault-style is vague, but the decision is limit sales to 21 and over is a good one. High Capacity Magazines are unnecessary and bump stocks are stupid.
1900 2018-02-28 16:52:35 4)Instead of that ban those private sales maybe require the sale to go through a dealer 5) I’m good with the ban on bump stocks 6) We have laws with big time punishments but they aren’t being prosecuted. Let’s require the government to actually prosecute these crimes
1901 2018-02-28 16:52:17 For a semi-auto weapon, it fires as fast as you can pull the trigger. Bump stocks make it so the recoil of the weapon will allow you to hold trigger down and fire as fast or slightly slower than and automatic firearm. It's what the Vegas shooter used in his attack.
1902 2018-02-28 16:51:47 stocks  Nestle,  Lever Brothers, HSBC, Commerz Bank  good choices for  value investors looking to expand beyond the super expensive U.S. market.
1903 2018-02-28 16:51:28 Dear @DICKS you seem to blame Every Responsible "tactical weapon" owner for the issues committed by a small amount of people. Here's what I believe should happen instead of banning a weapon. Raise the age 21 or 25, further background checks, and banning Bump Stocks.
1904 2018-02-28 16:51:05 Imo, there will be no point trying to sell $zcl. There'll be no buyers at any price point. This is why a stop loss is no good in this situation. Seen this in stocks. When there is a sudden revaluation down, you'll only get a buyer at a level someone will buy.
1905 2018-02-28 16:51:03 What I have heard is a need to regulate the sale of AR-15s. Regulate... not abolish the 2A. This includes increasing age limits and banning bump stocks and high capacity cartridges. No one is criminalizing gun owners... that's the spin from the NRA

1909 2018-02-28 16:50:04 I’m glad that they are doing this, but since gun shows, small retailers and private owners will continue to sell assault rifles, large capacity magazines, and bump stocks, I don’t think it will make much of a difference.

1925 2018-02-28 16:45:42 Just because it's illegal doesn't mean it doesn't happen. I'd say to prevent people from modifying their semi-auto weapons into automatic weapons, like bump stocks used on AR-15's, you should remove the weapon itself.

1928 2018-02-28 16:45:09 This is exactly where we can say that the public gets to express their preference for banning fully automatic weapons, and in response knowledgeable regulators *should* respond by banning bump-stocks as functionally equivalent.
1929 2018-02-28 16:44:59 I can tell you this much; with 56% of stocks still trading below their respective 200 day moving averages, there still more work to do. I think the easy money has been made, but "there's always a bull market somewhere".
1930 2018-02-28 16:44:45 And banning "bump stocks" always seemed like a distraction that would reduce #GunViolence by less than 1% (if at all).

1934 2018-02-28 16:43:55 common sense gun reform by passing laws to raise the minimum age to purchase guns to 21, to ban assault-type weapons and so-called bump stocks, and to conduct broader universal background checks that include mental-health information and previous interactions with law enforcement
1935 2018-02-28 16:43:49 Thanks for the info about this semi automatic rifle, which was used by several mass shooters in the last few horrific crimes in our lovely USA. Clearly this weapon, once stocks & bells & whistles are added, has been used for NON hunting related reasons & is WAY too EASY to get!!
1936 2018-02-28 16:43:34 I can say that taking away guns is not the ideal and not what I’m fighting for. I have no issue with someone who has passed a background check and/or mental health screening owning a gun. I do take issue with semi automatic guns and bump stocks.

1939 2018-02-28 16:42:30 Now trade Bump Stocks and raising the minimum gun age for funding for the wall! Don't give the Leftists an inch without getting something in return!
1940 2018-02-28 16:42:16 Could you provide your opinion if bump stocks are an infringement on 2a or not? Alot of debate in gun community, some don't care, but isn't this just another mode of fire like single or double action?
1941 2018-02-28 16:41:25 @tedlieu i have a idea that might work in place of an assult weapons ban, i suggest making assult weapons and bump stocks NFA items subject to extreme background checks, a federal tax stamp, around a year wait, and a lot of paperwork.

1950 2018-02-28 16:39:12 Ask any person familiar with how stocks work, whether or not this 1.8 percent hike means much at all. You see evidence of increase much quicker than you see evidence of profit loss. When it comes to profit and loss, never count your chickens before they hatch.
1951 2018-02-28 16:39:02 Finviz doesnt seem great for intraday plays tho? Or is it? It doesn't scan for stocks reaching high of day does it?
1952 2018-02-28 16:38:50 just bought 10/18 $60 $intc calls. these semi stocks really outperformed while the whole market was in a sea of red. hoping to get a chance to add more to my $mu position on any dips
1953 2018-02-28 16:38:47 $URA underwater on this one but added today to this #uranium fund almost come back to lows and can only see positive outlook for uranium going to be buying a selection of uranium stocks soon too
1954 2018-02-28 16:38:36 Don’t know about all that. Just tagged you as a follow-up to your claim that the NRA supported banning bump stocks, an assertion I don’t recall hearing anywhere else. Most I ever heard was that the NRA was reviewing bump stocks. Never concluded, to my knowledge.
1955 2018-02-28 16:38:23 There was a UN program to destroy Syrian gov stocks, however, as seen with the 2017 Khan Sheikhoun attacks, they retain stocks of Sarin.
1956 2018-02-28 16:38:07 I met a wealthy guy a few weeks ago, he explained how he has invested a substantial portfolio in various Hemp farm stocks... says its the biggest growing market about to explode.

1958 2018-02-28 16:37:31 I am fine with the banning of assault weapons & bump stocks. To say that an 18 year old can join our military & die for your freedom, but not purchase a gun from your store to protect themselves is just wrong.
1959 2018-02-28 16:37:14 Guess Ill be selling my stocks today, and picking up a few DICKS on the way, bye bye

Good night 
1961 2018-02-28 16:36:02 #StockMarket   With financials sure to lead the way in any market fall, best to hold off getting into them until after the Trump Crash. The sole exception being young millennials with a 40 to 50 ye ar horizon. They should be getting into DOW stocks and S&P-500 index funds.
1962 2018-02-28 16:36:00 I have a detailed spreadsheet of my expenses, money is automatically is transferred into savings on paydays, I have that account hidden so I don’t see the balance so I won’t spend it, and I picked an account with high interest, I have some money in crypto, some in stocks & bonds
1963 2018-02-28 16:35:53 European stocks down down down because of BreXit. I repeat as Bloomberg said: BreXit is as stupid as electing trump. Can you imagine where we would be with Bloomberg the brilliant businessman and leader was our president?
1964 2018-02-28 16:35:50 i still believe, no matter how low the current prices go, that crypto will one day be to Millennials what stocks were to baby boomers. fuel for future market growth and investment.
1965 2018-02-28 16:35:34 And we see this in smash, people locking in the wins they know they can get, glorifying the stocks they take in a set they know they can't win, then "meming" or "styling" in tough challenges saying "welp, I went DK" or "I was just having fun thats why I went for crazy shit".
1966 2018-02-28 16:35:23 I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!   The Presidents words.
1967 2018-02-28 16:35:20 He mentions investing in his music, and gifted Kim with a portfolio of stocks for their anniversary
1968 2018-02-28 16:34:52 Remain cautious for now and hold cash for a great buying opportunity in oil related stocks sometime in April/May.
1969 2018-02-28 16:34:31 FYI the 2nd amendment was intended for militias to be able to arm themselves against foreign invaders or a tyrannical government. W/muskets, by the way.  Not to arm extreme right wing domestic terrorists w/ AR-15s&bump stocks. If our military turned on us, your AR-15 is useless.
1970 2018-02-28 16:34:26 You know people can make bump stocks...
1971 2018-02-28 16:33:55 I think oil tracking stocks. s&p falls oil falls. eia bearish stocks still up provided support, then stocks fell lost support..
1972 2018-02-28 16:33:53 People really think bump stocks are a problem 
1973 2018-02-28 16:33:45 You can still have negative yearly bond returns and over a long enough time period stocks are likely to outperform bonds on cumulative total return basis, but on an yearly basis bonds can out perform stocks even from these low yield levels.

1978 2018-02-28 16:33:06 In Canada, the only 'bump stocks' available are for converting slow fire insults into weapons of rapid fire sarcasm.

1983 2018-02-28 16:31:53 On Fox Biz News today @ 2PM. Tune in! Markets working through corrective/recovery process which has stocks moving around in a range-bound fashion. Investors are digesting yesterday's upbeat message from new Fed Chair Powell along with today's somewhat tempered economic data.
1984 2018-02-28 16:31:47 No, they always got after market stocks for their muskets before taking them to war.
1985 2018-02-28 16:31:45 Bump stocks should be banned .. These deplorables are crawling out of the woodwork
1986 2018-02-28 16:29:34 as usual, US stocks turning lower
1987 2018-02-28 16:29:24 Round earthers are the laughing stocks because the flat earth is so easy to see. If you don't know the earth is flat, it's because you really to care to know.
1988 2018-02-28 16:29:04 What will keep criminals from getting assault weapons & bump stocks, & how will 18-20 yr old ADULTS defend themselves?
1989 2018-02-28 16:28:47 The newest 'shining 'objects are  : raising age limits , pretending to want to ban bump stocks & fake concern over violent mentally disturbed persons getting guns ! All to avoid responsible gun laws ! Bastards , just bastards !
1990 2018-02-28 16:28:44 Correct. Bump stocks ruin your aim for anything except shooting into a crowd. As you point out single fire is the preferred setting of us soldiers.
1991 2018-02-28 16:28:15 So all these companies who are boycotting the NRA are losing money!  The ones who are backing the NRA are doubling their stocks!  Liberals are losing everywhere they turn! 
1992 2018-02-28 16:27:56 Cloud connected to online api's, can track things like stocks, emails whatever you want with colours on the keyboard. Great for business.
1993 2018-02-28 16:27:37 Eighty-two percent of respondents say that so-called "bump stocks" should be banned. Similar numbers favor banning assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold more than 10 rounds: 79 percent and 78 percent, respectively.
1994 2018-02-28 16:27:25 This FL student “ordered “ FedEx to dump stocks and NRA?? Ordered them??  This kid doesn’t even realize the consequences of his thoughts!!  Where are his parents ?  Oh in the swamp with Hillary!!!
1995 2018-02-28 16:27:09 February is over.  Up 139% this month.  871% since beginning of the year. Today $NFLX -$14, $SPY +$315. #options are amazing for low balance accounts.  #stocks #money #goals

1996 2018-02-28 16:27:06 All sarcasm aside, global corn stocks are going to see a sizable cut
1997 2018-02-28 16:26:55 Research them as like all stocks etc. Then decide.
1998 2018-02-28 16:26:35 Agree with you.  A US investor in German stocks may keep EUR after selling German stocks if he may re-invest in another German stock later.  FX EUR/USD could be T+2, stock could be T+2/3, hence may keep EUR for a while.  But crypto settlement cycle could be very short/instant.
1999 2018-02-28 16:26:34 For clarity's sake, they never sold bump stocks.

2001 2018-02-28 16:26:09 Okay well in mass shootings, full auto is used to hurt more people. Which is why people want bump stocks banned for civilians.

-Ban of bump stocks

-All students must participate in mandatory active shooter drills

2005 2018-02-28 16:22:49 Weren't we supposed to hear something about the Tabu and Spliffin deal by today latest? Might be mixing stocks up here, but I seem to remember the 28th of Feb having significance.
2006 2018-02-28 16:22:02 True. I’m probably jumping the gun. Just feels like we made a lot of new highs last week in commodity stocks that then reversed lower in a big way.

2019 2018-02-28 16:19:33 Let’s focus on Amazon next. You can still buy all kinds of bump stocks and other AR 15 accessories very easily from them. Would love to hear other options to use. A great market for someone to corner perhaps?
2020 2018-02-28 16:19:20 Dicks Sporting Goods is making a monumental movement by taking matters into their own hands and not waiting for the government to make change. Age bump, no automatic rifles, no bump stocks, and no high holding magazines.
2021 2018-02-28 16:19:11 Guns back then and the ones we have today are not the same and plus they didn’t have bump stocks and many of other add ons

2027 2018-02-28 16:18:06 But but they are. Even if we said a stock AR-15 is not, it has more conversion kits than any other rifle 2 get burst or full auto like capabilities. Hellfire triggers, bump stocks, front grips etc. Special forces aren't raiding the Middle East with hunting rifles
2028 2018-02-28 16:18:03 Let me help you, Dicks's Sporting stop selling most assault weapons after Sandy Hook and they have never sold bump stocks, there :) Only major change is selling age 21 and over. Happy but lets not make this more than it is, a drama marketing stunt

2030 2018-02-28 16:17:57 NRA 5 mil. “Majority” of USA -NO assault weapons, no Bump stocks, no sales to under 21, thorough background checks,  NOW !!!!
2031 2018-02-28 16:17:51 They would have changed the wording to specify that. Look I think both parties need to elect better politicians. But when one side is suggesting baking bump stocks, high capacity mags, and limit access to "assault rifles" however we want to define that, and the other side is
2032 2018-02-28 16:17:26 I am interested mostly in weed , robotics and space mining stocks.
2033 2018-02-28 16:17:25 Dicks sporting goods after three years of falling stocks have choose this moment to step into the political front page to drum up business by slapping there sports men in the face.  #boycottdickssportinggoods
2034 2018-02-28 16:17:03 The U.S. did not ban semi-automatic firearms - the ban was on accessories, Flash hiders, grenade launchers, collapsible stocks, bipods, bayonet lugs. Not the actions of firearms. Please do your homework.
2035 2018-02-28 16:16:40 Are you kidding me?! They won’t do a thing about bump stocks, background checks, or even TALK about banning AR-15s, but a discussion about polling place dress code is on the agenda!! C’mon man.

2038 2018-02-28 16:15:56 I applaud Dick’s Sporting Goods. They have banned assault weapons, bump stocks, etc. & raised the age to 21. This is huge, & I respect them.

2040 2018-02-28 16:15:18 Think those stocks should be set up at the Irish Border, with one for each UK Cabinet member who's waxed lyrical about a frictionless border with no clue how to deliver said 'solution'. They should be stripped first as their solution is as naked as the Emperor with no clothes.

2042 2018-02-28 16:14:42 Correction, unless by universal you mean all sales including private. That's just not possible. Also, bump stocks are preferable because you can actually illegally modify guns to fire full auto while retaining accuracy. Psycho wants a full auto gun I'd rather it be inaccurate.
2043 2018-02-28 16:14:00 Another sell off in equities....... #stocks
2044 2018-02-28 16:13:56 It’s the companies and business that will hurt them on a large scale. Also people who own @FedEx stocks and or gun makers stock....
2045 2018-02-28 16:13:46 US stocks don't like a thing or lot of things....
2046 2018-02-28 16:13:09 Make no mistake, moving to the government controlling everything is why Trump was elected. Securing gun free zones is the answer, not taking away guns. Bump stocks sure outlaw them, they are for autos but besides that, stay out of my pocket and my freedom to choose.
2047 2018-02-28 16:13:06 I would recommend putting a 2nd mortgage on your house extracting all equity and use the proceeds to buy stocks on margin.
2048 2018-02-28 16:12:45 Congrats to Dick’s Sporting Goods for taking the right stand about bump stocks, assault guns and age limit to buy guns.  Too bad our Senators can’t stand up and be brave like Dick’s.  At least they care about American citizens.

2051 2018-02-28 16:12:25 Actually no, I don’t support weapons confiscation AT ALL (regardless of what the gop keep telling you) I support a far stricter more comprehensive federal background (that incorporates mental illness history) check, the ban of bump stocks and high capacity magazines.
2052 2018-02-28 16:12:10 GBP/JPY falls below 200-dma and is testing the Nov low The yen is at the highs of the day
Yen crosses are crumbling in a broad move. USD/JPY hit stops on a fall below yesterday's lows. Risk aversion is kicking in with stocks giving up all their gains.
2053 2018-02-28 16:12:09 For those watching Treasury yields and the potential impact on stocks, we are a month away from the Fed's balance sheet wind down ramping up to $30b per month and $90b per quarter. That could put upward pressure on yields.
2054 2018-02-28 16:12:07 Dick’s Sporting Goods out here doing more than our clown of a president. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, and hi-cap mags. It’s not that fucking hard!
2055 2018-02-28 16:11:56 A lot of big stocks “came up from the bottom” and people took the opportunity to book some profits. Algos also move from 1 level to next.
2056 2018-02-28 16:11:41 Sorry Sonia you are wrong. You will see stocks come tumbling down. Other stores stocks shall increase
2057 2018-02-28 16:10:28 I work in the financial sector and I still get confused when it comes to stocks 
2058 2018-02-28 16:10:17 Pizza Hut to be the next official pizza sponsor of the NFL. Their stocks will probably increase.

2060 2018-02-28 16:10:08 This administration? Which president came out saying he's going to ban bump stocks, and raise the age of purchase to 21? Pretty sure it wasn't any president previous.

2064 2018-02-28 16:09:36 Wall street is trashing almost all stocks again today, fyi.  SCAM!  They claim economy, technology, industrials, etc.etc.etc. all suck despite good corporate earnings/forecasts. Might want to ask your Goldman pals what's going on
2065 2018-02-28 16:09:30 For those trading stocks. Looking at giant blue chippers that should turn around within years. GE has been plummeting. New CEO and figure there’s a time table for turn around. 

Currently trading in the low $14 bucks but could be in the $26 area quickly

Thoughts??
2066 2018-02-28 16:09:09 Please explain how eliminating bump stocks will “prevent violence”.

 Will eliminating rocks prevent B&Es?

 Will eliminating premium TV channels prevent bank robberies?

 Will removing corners eliminate car crashes?

 The bump stock never created any violence.

2072 2018-02-28 16:08:03 Retailers report; GDP updates; Stocks muddle along
2073 2018-02-28 16:07:48 1) That's fine
2) Only gives psychos more time to plan and prevents people who need to defend themselves quickly from doing so.
3)Assault rifles are already heavily restricted, HC mags don't matter. regular mags can be changed in seconds, bump stocks make a gun wildly inaccurate.
2074 2018-02-28 16:06:59 But the NRA was okay throwing it's members that have bump stocks under the bus with a proposed ban. I'm missing your logic.
2075 2018-02-28 16:06:54 *while stocks remaining.
2076 2018-02-28 16:06:52 Not exactly.
At the time, legal opinions were that no current law prohibited bump stocks.
2077 2018-02-28 16:06:47 wait till THDS comes back into play and watch people chase the RM
2078 2018-02-28 16:06:26 geez your guys stocks are really taking a dump on the markets,guess virtue signaling aint so good for busness eh
2079 2018-02-28 16:06:22 Exactly. On a completely unrelated note, I cannot believe how ridiculously CHEAP the stocks of the energy companies are. All of them. The valuations of these US shale oil companies are absurd!
I feel a massive short squeeze coming: not sure when, but it’s out there...
2080 2018-02-28 16:06:21 Oh right. I forgot that every time the stock market goes up it's Obama but Trump's fault when the stocks go down. Also, stop watching CNN. Russians put a ton of money into supporting Hillary.

2082 2018-02-28 16:05:54 Of course it didn't do a damned thing to make you useful enough to ban bump stocks, limit clip size, reinstate assault weapons ban or actually protect children.  @GOP truly lousy at caring for children.
2083 2018-02-28 16:05:41 Several stocks have now turned green on my watch list. I think the bottom may be in.

2084 2018-02-28 16:05:31 Stocks? How long are you planning on holding your positions? Swing and day trading with an account that small is pretty much impossible with commissions.  I would recommend some commission free ETFs to diversify your portfolio and preserve capital.

2090 2018-02-28 16:03:07 Ban bump stocks. Rubber bands work as well and are cheaper. What did you solve?
2091 2018-02-28 16:02:54 NQ also, figured the fade would be early, see where we go today
2092 2018-02-28 16:02:50 The Constitution, Bill of Rights or any subsequent amendments do not guarantee anyone's right to own an AR-15, extended magazines, bump stocks or any similar weapon and accessories. That's a fact.

2095 2018-02-28 16:02:22 A simple plan:  ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks and tighten background checks.

2098 2018-02-28 16:01:30 To be fair, it seems each of you understands the volatility of stocks. Here's the important part, if Dick's Sporting Goods sales go up now that they've stopped selling assault weapons.

I personally will start shopping there now (didn't before because of the guns in the store)
2099 2018-02-28 16:01:17 its a start? a start for banning all guns?
you do know that it was obama that passed bumper stocks? and it was the NRA that said slow down... hmmm on purpose maybe? playing you commies one crises at a time.

2101 2018-02-28 16:00:44 In the long-run, a currency can only have a hyperinflation and collapse or a hyperdeflation and stabilize. Bitcoin is in the process of the latter because people think it may become a global money. Other asset classes like stocks and bonds were never thought of as monies.
2102 2018-02-28 16:00:44 Do you get that Trump has put in for a ban on bump stocks? Do you even know what a bump stock is?
2103 2018-02-28 16:00:34 First to the @nra...bump stocks should be illegal because it makes it possible to circumvent the law about automatic weapons. Second who needs to 30 round clip? Third a semi automatic rifle like an at-15 is a military grade Civilian weapon made to kill human as fast as possible.

2112 2018-02-28 16:00:16 I have no problem with banking dumb stocks. You are so missing the big picture when you want to BAN things you know NOTHING about. But enjoy and keep up the fight, just remember People Kill not Guns.

2115 2018-02-28 15:59:18 So, they can quit selling a particular gun or bump stocks or etc. Agreed. Beyond that is strategy. So, what is best there?
2116 2018-02-28 15:58:57 Reinstate Obama era legislation against mental ill people owning guns. Ban bump stocks.Make it impossible to get a gun if you're on the terrorist watch list.Limit magazine size.Get assault weapons out of sporting goods stores.Impose age restrictions on gun purchases.
2117 2018-02-28 15:58:49 Well it’s stocks, so they’ll rebound. Honestly I forgot they even sold guns.

2128 2018-02-28 15:56:06 It’d be too much to ask, I suppose, if we limited civilians to weapons based on (1) muzzle velocity; and (2) stock rounds-per-minute (RPM) or RPM easily achieved by modification or unorthodox firing methods (belt loops work like bump stocks).

2132 2018-02-28 15:55:16 1/“The real problem with gun violence is not about mental hospitals, armed teachers, bump stocks or age requirements. The real problem is that there are far too many firearms in America — more than 300 million, according to Congress.“

2137 2018-02-28 15:54:31 They were transparent enough to explain why they couldn't communicate directly with shareholders though...
2138 2018-02-28 15:54:18 stocks I chased yesterday don't look so bad now.  Although it was probably luck more than anything else.  Picked up 1000 $crz at $3.4 and added $rti and $lxx this morning.  Will be looking to sell the strength and raise cash for the next 3 days.

2150 2018-02-28 15:53:07 If the conversation isn’t about getting money out of government, then the conversation isn’t about defeating the NRA. If we sink to the point where the ban of bump stocks is celebrated as a victory, blood spilled in the next shooting is on our hands.

2154 2018-02-28 15:52:26 Depends. During the last bond bear mkt, when UST10yr went from 2.5% in 1952 to 14% in 1982, the largest negative annual total return was 5%; however, for stocks, the largest neg. return was 26%, T-Bills did not have a neg. year! Stocks are much more expensive now than in 1952-82.

2159 2018-02-28 15:51:18 .@NYGovCuomo calls raising the age for gun purchases and banning bump stocks are "baby steps."
2160 2018-02-28 15:51:18 No. Trump said, “If Congress doesn’t act.”  That was a signal that Congress needs to write the law.  If it does, they can write it such that it only gives ATF the power to regulate bump stocks. Period.

What you’re not understanding is it’s not bump stocks
It Is the federal government having the ability to regulate gun parts without Congress that is the issue

If he does this what will stop the next liberal president from regulating every gun part?.

2296 2018-02-28 15:27:13 After all these mass shootings Americans should have been talking. Instead we were told not to. Then it got off headlines. Now?  We have bump stocks and a new bill for silencers. Weapons getting into the wrong hands. Enough already. Time for real action.

2) completely overhaul our mental health system and redo our current background check system

2435 2018-02-28 15:00:06 @Academy I’ve shopped at your stores for my entire life. That will end now.  My business will go to Dick’s Sporting Goods for their principled ban on assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. I hope someday you’ll do the same.
2436 2018-02-28 15:00:05 And a buyback on bump stocks and assault weapons!
2437 2018-02-28 14:59:51 Hi Laura. We'd advise you look on our website under flight status to check your flight. At the moment your flight is showing as delayed until 17:45 but we'd recommend unless otherwise stated please go to the airport for the original departure time. ^Beth
2438 2018-02-28 14:59:12 Marco that’s our problem......religion. It befouls and corrupts most all it touches....especially politics.  Your message of Jesus Christ comes wrapped in AR 15s and bump stocks.
2439 2018-02-28 14:58:53 Did you raise your suggestion on Banning Bump Stocks, and raising the age to 21 to purchase any gun?  You did support that the other night at the Town Hall.

2463 2018-02-28 14:55:37 I rarely go short individual stocks, and I think $BPMX has a very bright future (FDA approval?) but when it gets into the .30-.40s, it'll be significantly overbought. 

$BPMX absolutely has $ATOS or $AKER potential, but a healthy pullback is probably also in the short term cards.

2469 2018-02-28 14:54:05 @jimcramer stick to stocks!  The AR 15 is a hunting rifle.  It’s actually a Varmint fun not considered big enough for deer hunting!  Just because it looks like a M16 military gun doesn’t mean anything!  It’s not even in the same league.  12 gauge shotgun would have done way more!
2470 2018-02-28 14:53:48 Springfield 30-06 won't do? Nothing against guns. At all. They are fun. Love to shoot skeet etc. We need background checks and more control with private sales. And high capacity mags and semi auto need to go. Who needs bump stocks? Who?
2471 2018-02-28 14:53:43 I guess on that day i will go buy a semi auto AR 10 .308 I've been eyeing, puchase a few dozen mags, read my last Nra magazines and buy more stocks in gun makers. All In all that's a great day. #IAmTheNRA #MAGA #RedNationRising .

2479 2018-02-28 14:52:04 Pretty sure Dick's stocks and company outlook is in the toilet already so I don't see this helping them? I don't see this doing anything, this is just a company caving to peer pressure

2482 2018-02-28 14:51:19 The point of the law isn’t to make it impossible to get a bump stock. No ban will ever keep someone who wants something from getting it. The point of the law is to limit the access to bump stocks. It’s not perfect and progress needs to be made but it’s a good first step.
2483 2018-02-28 14:51:14 Seeing that as well. There will be a backlash in the coming days from the actual industry experts who already railing against the sham report from faceless knobs hiding behind the Morgan Stanley name.

2489 2018-02-28 14:49:57 I don't understand how a billion dollar industry allows this  kind of thinking. Businesses buying stocks, for example, aren't just going on the ol' gut anymore, right?
2490 2018-02-28 14:49:44 Here’s an idea. Let anyone buy ANY weapon. Even bump stocks.But they have to enlist for 2 years and go through bootcamp to get trained on how to be a “well organized militia”. Play Rambo for real! Heck don’t even need to be that extreme. National Guard is ok. Boot camp is a must!

It's the laws and the agencies that enforce them that need to be addressed I gave no issue with banning Bump stocks and making back ground checks mandatory but get real people
2536 2018-02-28 14:36:23 @DICKS wonders why their stocks are doing so badly that they figuratively shoot themselves in the foot to offend their shoppers. I see you ending up the same way as Sports Authority very soon.

2538 2018-02-28 14:34:57 If Trump gives them a law that bans Bump stocks an they will find a liberal judge to interpret it as a ban on all semi auto weapons.

2544 2018-02-28 14:33:17 Now Paul is the time to show you REALLY heard them.  I’m not asking that we take people’s guns.  Ban bump stocks, Ban accessories to convert assault rifles into full auto, Ban sale of AR15 and similar weapons to civilians, extensive background checks, no fly- no buy, mentally ill
2545 2018-02-28 14:33:12 Banning all guns is NOT good. We should simply expand the classifications for certain weapons, comparable to a Monster truck being illegal on city streets. Once the combination of power, capacity, and/or gadgets to enable rapid firing (bump stocks) reach a level-should be illegal

2558 2018-02-28 14:29:36 Redmi Note 5 pro was also not on display at Westend Mall Pune. Why @XiaomiIndia wants to lose customers? I know 12 people who bought Honor 9 lite after unsuccessful attempt. @RedmiIndia pls go and learn marketing. No stocks in Mi Homes!!? 12ppl got it in store I visited.
2559 2018-02-28 14:29:36 I’m sincerely not seeking a nasty back & forth. The left, me included, is open to a reasonable compromise. The right won’t exclude bump stocks. There really is no equivalency.
2560 2018-02-28 14:29:14 I'm glad they are concentrating on common-sense legislation now instead of talking about stocks.... rapid cyclic rate, high capacity, and the ability to reload quickly are the common denominator. Always has been.
2561 2018-02-28 14:29:03 Huge mistake imo to be long EUR/USD and equally huge mistake to be long stocks atm. I am short DAX, and long USD/EUR
2562 2018-02-28 14:28:36 To little you need to stop the sales of AR-15's and bump stocks! The shooters in Sandy Hook, Las Vegas and Florida were not on NO Fly lists they....
2563 2018-02-28 14:28:11 Well congratulations! That was part of the new legislation in Florida! Mission accomplished! As for bump stocks, they're stupid and overpriced gimmicks. In the decade or so they've exist they've only been used once.
2564 2018-02-28 14:28:06 What happen again? You like stocks sia, go up and down so fast one
2565 2018-02-28 14:27:50 YES PLEASE SELL!!!!  When stocks flood the market, they drop in price and others can buy the discounted stocks.  I love willful idiots.

2570 2018-02-28 14:26:56 What we said last night and have re-tweeted below takes on a greater meaning now that we are going into Wednesday's open with an 85 point gain in the Dow and 31 pt gain in the Nasdaq: "There is really no serious breakdown in stocks yet"
2571 2018-02-28 14:26:52 Thank you for your leadership @AndreaSCousins to enact a ban on bump stocks, tighten background checks, and allow judges to issue gun violence protection orders. You should be the New York Senate Majority Leader!

2579 2018-02-28 14:25:31 I do not.  I do support banning bump stocks and the sale of tools intended to allow people to illegally convert to fully automatic.  I also am a very strong advocate for mental health reform and preventing severely mentally ill people from purchasing guns.
2580 2018-02-28 14:25:25 @SpeakerRyan 

Bring the bills to the floor. The American people overwhelming want gun control. No honest man needs more than 10 rounds. Universal background check. Ban bump stocks.

Do your job!

2590 2018-02-28 14:22:57 Never sold bump stocks, they said.
2591 2018-02-28 14:22:51 Even Obama sold bump stocks. I'm just sayin.
2592 2018-02-28 14:22:49 Idiots you can make your own bump stocks and there are plenty of other places to buy from, including the black market thanks to liberals keeping our borders open and those that don’t care about laws... so your virtual signaling does nothing but cost you sales in the long run

2597 2018-02-28 14:21:05 To me, it seems that the country has lost its way when people are arguing that their right to own an assault rifle and with or without bump stocks is more important than the right of people to not be massacred at school.
2598 2018-02-28 14:20:30 @davidhogg111  Today with the news about Dick’s Sporting Goods Dumping Assault weapons, large magazines and Bump Stocks and changing age limits... that’s becaus of all of you. You’ve saved so many lives. You’re All amazing. Thank you.
2599 2018-02-28 14:20:23 No one needs assault style weapons, Bump Stocks or high capacity mags. They are for killing, not hunting.
All gun owners should have the same requirements as car owners/drivers.

2600 2018-02-28 14:20:16 yet people who own stocks in the companies are complicit in the carnage.  One doesn't need congress to sell their stocks in these companies.  We can do both.
2601 2018-02-28 14:19:57 @jimcramer   Suggest you stick to stocks. Your ignorance of AR semi-auto rifles and guns in general is appalling.  Guns do not kill any more that cars kill, or knives kill. I have watched my AR rifle for 15 years and my cars and knives.  None have gone on a killing spree yet.
2602 2018-02-28 14:19:41 Thank you @DICKS for your responsible decision to ban assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines from your stores! Hi pledge to do all my sporting goods shopping at your stores. Your patriotic act makes us proud.

2608 2018-02-28 14:18:05 I don’t and never will get it If bump stocks are a no brainer then why not save time and $$$ and ban ALL assault type weapons even beyond AR15 They are of no use to anyone with good intentions PERIOD
2609 2018-02-28 14:17:21 .@realDonaldTrump is so good, the states have started to enact their own laws. Bye bye bump stocks, hello net neutrality...if you live in WA @jaketapper
2610 2018-02-28 14:17:03 Don't need bump stocks, extended mags, silencers. Limit the mag size in general. Banning all guns might be the answer but it's never going to happen. Both sides need to meet halfway.
2611 2018-02-28 14:16:39 @jimcramer @carlquintanilla stick to stocks please. @Cabelas is where I go for hunting and self defense purchases
2612 2018-02-28 14:16:38 That's why Gun Fairies like Bump Stocks. They vibrate.
2613 2018-02-28 14:16:25 @jimcramer how many times have you gone hunting? How much do you know about rifles- more importantly the types of ammo rifles shoot, magazine types diff looking rifles accommodate? Maybe stick to stocks
2614 2018-02-28 14:15:52 I would like to know if the Democrats that scream the loudest about guns own stocks in gun and ammo companies ie. Obama @NRA #2A @realDonaldTrump @seanhannity @dloesch @chrisloesch

2620 2018-02-28 14:13:56 @SCHEELS Would you please consider following the lead of Dick’s Sporting Goods and ban the sale of assault rifles, high-capacity magazines, bump stocks and take a pledge not to sell guns to anyone under 21 years of age?  Please act NOW!!!

2632 2018-02-28 14:09:52 Glad ur supporting ban on bump stocks & expanding background checks.

2645 2018-02-28 14:07:08 You know I knew they didn't sell guns... But I honestly did not know that they sold bump stocks and accessories.I had to look it up. I'm guessing they sell it because that's easier for the USPS to ship instead of shipping a weapon.Disturbing all the same.

2681 2018-02-28 13:54:00 @NRA There are so many elements of change that you could be pushing for: Raising the purchase age of guns; condemning bump stocks; selling big killing machines only to military; comprehensive national background checks; mental illness treatment. You can get behind lots of things.
2682 2018-02-28 13:53:57 You are looking at the short game.  You are giving theFederal Government the power to regulate GUN PARTS not just bump stocks. 

Paul Ryan already said no gun ban was going to happen. 

So again what is going to stop the next liberal president From outlawing all other gun parts?
2683 2018-02-28 13:53:43 モチベ高いけどなんのモチベが高いのか自分でもよくわかってないからとりあえず踊ってる
2684 2018-02-28 13:53:42 Dianne I stand with you, but every single machine shop in America can make a bump stock next to free. Can’t stop people from shaping metal. The honest people already wouldn’t use bump stocks to harm people.
2685 2018-02-28 13:53:04 Everything you said in that tweet is a lie, or you have no idea what you're talking about.  The NRA doesn't sell guns or 'ways to fortify against the effects of those guns'.  Also, the President just defied the NRA by moving to ban bump stocks.
2686 2018-02-28 13:52:11 Afraid not. I dont think our branch stocks it
2687 2018-02-28 13:52:07 And, people don’t change their mind based on new information or the strong (97% of Americans want bump stocks banned and mandatory background checks) desire of their constituents.
2688 2018-02-28 13:51:28 The CEO of Dick's Sporting Goods was on GMA this morning.  He announced that Dick's will no longer sell assault rifles, stocks which will turn arms into assault weapons, sell to anyone under the age of 21.  Way to go Dicks Sporting Goods!  Maybe other chains will follow suit!

2692 2018-02-28 13:50:19 Will @DICKS be divesting any stocks it owns in defense contractors? Of course not.
2693 2018-02-28 13:49:57 Agreed. People who inherit homes, stocks or get life insurance payouts when their parents pass have an advantage over those who don’t. 

More blacks being college educated will close the income gap but not the cumulative advantage of generations of inherited wealth.
2694 2018-02-28 13:49:52 Huge show of strength with 100s of police on site as Parkland students return to school.

FL legislators chose to worry about the dangers of pornography instead of assault weapons and even refused to pursue a ban on bump stocks.

2697 2018-02-28 13:49:25 My first tweet in who knows how long.  Hey @DICKS Sporting goods, I'm with YOU!  Stand up for the right to gun ownership while firmly against the sale of bump stocks and assault rifles.  Glad to see +21 too!
2698 2018-02-28 13:49:17 Max means you don't own stocks, depositary holds it for you
2699 2018-02-28 13:49:16 @BassProShops will you end the sale of assault style rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks in your stores? Will you step up and be good, responsible corporate citizens? Or will you continue to kowtow to the NRA? The next generation of outdoorsmen are watching.

2712 2018-02-28 13:45:32 I wish there still stocks of suhorang outfits by the time im in korea :(
2713 2018-02-28 13:45:25 Agree - now get right on the right side of assault rifles, bump stocks, background checks etc - to help save lives.
2714 2018-02-28 13:45:22 Can you protect yourself without AR15s and bump stocks? I'm fairly certain you can. 
2715 2018-02-28 13:45:09 As a previous employee behind their gun counter, I can say they literally haven't sold "assault style weapons" for years. This is not news, it's advertisement since sales and stocks have plummeted. Not classy Dicks.
2716 2018-02-28 13:44:24 @Academy will you end the sale of assault style rifles, high capacity magazines and bump stocks? If you want to retain my business & not send me to your competitors, it would be in everyone's best interest.
@DICKS has made a stand. Your turn.

2718 2018-02-28 13:43:55 They are choosing to protect people vs making you happy. Why do you need an automatic rifle or bump stocks? Huh? Why do you need an AR-15?
2719 2018-02-28 13:43:38 Like bump stocks. People acting like it make a semi automatic into a full automatic. It doesn't. It doesn't turn an AR 15 into a machine gun. I have mixed feelings about regulating them, but I'm not about to support someone who willfully lies about what bump stocks actually do.
2720 2018-02-28 13:43:27 Stocks edge higher after previous decline.

We the People don't want you to cave in to the anti-gun crowd.
Why are you having the @jeffsessions & DOJ make bump stocks illegal?
When was the last time a bump stock hurt anyone on its own?
Same argument - it's the person not the gun or bump stock!

2725 2018-02-28 13:41:43 Congratulations 2 Dick's Sporting Goods! Will no longer sell assault weapons & bump stocks!This is a bold move on their part! I shop at Bass Pro shops,Cabelas & Dick's but will now shop exclusively at Dick's. It's good 2 see a Company that cares more about human lives than $!
2726 2018-02-28 13:41:23 Ingredients planning including cost and nutrition summary. Estimates to central purchase so that stocks will not go low on warehouses. Handling for stores so their stock will not be empty. To name just a few capabilities of the sw missing initaly.
2727 2018-02-28 13:41:16 @BassProShops What is your position  on selling military grade assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines in your stores?
2728 2018-02-28 13:40:54 In the wake of the Parkland shooting, @DICKS announces they will no longer sell assault-style rifles in their Field & Stream or DICK'S stores, no longer sell firearms to anyone under 21, no longer sell high capacity magazines, & never have and never will sell bump stocks.

2738 2018-02-28 13:38:34 Worrying fact! Notwithstanding that the (cross country or else) studies show effect of remittances on economic growth, the relationship may remain elusive after  (among other things) the offsetting impacts of migrant stocks on home country economic product are accounted for.
2739 2018-02-28 13:38:29 @DICKS Way to go Dick's! Thank you for standing up and doing the right thing for the public. Thank you for showing and making an example of yourselves, that it's ok to refuse to sell automatic rifles, ban stocks and restricting the age requirements. THANK YOU!
2740 2018-02-28 13:38:16 The responsible thing to do is to expand the classifications for these weapons, comparable to a Monster truck being illegal on city streets. Once the combination of power, capacity, and/or gadgets to enable rapid firing (bump stocks) reach a certain level, it should be illegal
2741 2018-02-28 13:37:30 You want to ban bump stocks? I'm good with that. You want to make it mandatory for gun owners to take a gun safety and competency course before being able to take possession of a purchased weapon? I'm good with that too.
2742 2018-02-28 13:36:52 @DICKS Thank you for stopping your sales of automatic weapons Will this ban include magazines of bullets and bump stocks?
2743 2018-02-28 13:36:49 Joe mansion comparing sports cars to bump stocks is ridiculous.
2744 2018-02-28 13:36:35 Wow, what an amazing piece of legislation!  By gosh, it’s down right patriotic!  Imagine, those nasty gun owners embracing this and immediately destroying their already purchased bump stocks!  Wow!  Look at us cries Washington to the Nation!  Rejoice!

2748 2018-02-28 13:35:09 @DICKS Thank you for stopping your sales of automatic weapons and for raising the age to 21. Will this ban include magazines of bullets and bump stocks?
2749 2018-02-28 13:35:09 D: Get rid of assault rifles

R: See, there’s your problem. I can’t take anyone seriously who calls them “assault rifles”

D: Fine. Get rid of bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles with 30-round magazines

R: No
2750 2018-02-28 13:35:02 I think bump stocks are stupid & counterproductive; the point of a stock is to get a firm base for your weapon.

That said, look at who's driving this; people who hate guns. Period, point blank. This is just the latest trendy thing that they're using.

Don't give them an inch.
2751 2018-02-28 13:34:59 I kid you not... this financial writer suggests that to avoid funds with gun stocks invest in "socially responsible" mutual funds or those that are "SHARIAH COMPLIANT." Can't make this shit up.
2752 2018-02-28 13:34:53 Stocks found some support on the +6.5 point increase in the Conference Board's Feb U.S. consumer confidence to a 17-1/4 year high of 130.8, stronger than expectations of +1.1 to 126.5.
2753 2018-02-28 13:34:47 The Supreme Court has Ruled that Assault Weapons, Weapons of War, are Not included in the 2nd Amendment! That includes Assault Rifles, Semi-Automatic Rifles & Pistols, Bump
Stocks, Large Capacity Magazines, etc! The NRA has lost 3 times in the past 10 yrs trying to get
them Legal
2754 2018-02-28 13:34:45 So glad to hear that Dick’s Sporting  Goods no longer selling assault style rifles. This is due to the hard work Parkland students have put into having their message heard.  Field and Streams is the store that sold the guns and bump stocks. No more.
2755 2018-02-28 13:34:28 god your so dumb tomi,the NRA didn't kill anyone but b smart a little, if they refuse to ban any military style war weapons & b.stocks they are not helping.sell defense weapons,hunting rifles all u want.until u can tell us why we need AR15s in the public's hands u make no sense.

2764 2018-02-28 13:31:48 Yes as to ending the sale of Bump Stocks, No to raising the minimum age, Perhaps as to the further strengthening of background checks as "mental health" is a complex issue which can be used to possibly violate someone's Constitutional right...
2765 2018-02-28 13:31:23 You said stocks went up. That past tense. I'm asking which ones went up. That's all.
2766 2018-02-28 13:31:07 What are Underlyings from options ? only Stocks or even Indices, Energy, Bonds, Metals, Grains, Currentlys ?

2795 2018-02-28 13:23:17 I met with my financial advisor on Monday to make sure none of my $$ are invested in gun stocks. Does Vanguard offer a tool to customers so that they can screen their investments? Or is there a socially conscious fund that you offer? All of my friends are worried about this.

No one has a right to bump stocks.
America has too many guns.
2804 2018-02-28 13:21:25 When can we expect legislation on banning bump stocks, and increasing the minimum age for buying any weapon?

2805 2018-02-28 13:21:24 Wall street is becoming a complete SCAM again, IRAs under attack. Better hold these rats accountable.

2806 2018-02-28 13:21:01 Yeah, but you can't assault someone with a Glock.

No such thing as a drive-by assaulting. No sir. Can't happen. 

One can only assault people with a scary, black, polymer-furnitured gun with a high capacity magazine and like 12 bump stocks.

2824 2018-02-28 13:13:56 Sen Rob Portman (D-Oh) is now making quiet little noises about raising the legal age and maybe looking at bump stocks. He’s way in the pocket of the NRA, not up for election and moves at the pace of a zombie.
2825 2018-02-28 13:13:47 They did not check me. And the point I made to that person was the same point you made in this statement.

CREATE SCARCITY.

Scarcity = Higher price

Abundance = Lower price

2884 2018-02-28 12:53:46 Comrade, same should apply to semi automatic & extended clips and bump stocks.

2889 2018-02-28 12:50:40 Which means Q4 will have similar numbers.... considering the circumstances hope they build up enough stocks for next couple of quarters as well 


2890 2018-02-28 12:50:10 It really is though. In all ways but the auto feature and overall size it IS an M16. And it can be made to be full auto with one small part or simulate auto fire with bump stocks, but regardless, the automatic feature of an M16 or M4 is typically not used even by military.
2891 2018-02-28 12:50:00 It is easy to predict this will provoke a stampede to buy AR15s and other assault rifles. Probably bump stocks, too. ... But that, too, will pass

2906 2018-02-28 12:45:27 Yes they had a Q4 2012 sales decline all though much was before the gun announcement. Stocks dropped 10% in Q1 2013. But later they increase to a high of nearly $60/share or double of Q1 2013. So no real evidence they list out by not selling assault rifles.

2912 2018-02-28 12:41:42 True.. 60% of RJs investment is in 3to5 stocks for long holding period... The challenge is in identifying such stock in its early stage...

2914 2018-02-28 12:41:03 Looking for sectors to short based on weekly charts where the action is below the 30 week EMA and starting to rollover after putting in decent rises. Aerospace & Defence, Construction & Materials, Household Goods (I hold 2 stocks there) and Personal Goods sectors appeal the most
2915 2018-02-28 12:40:47 @andrewrsorkin WTF is Joey yammerin’ about?

Dick’s can chose to sell/not sell any products they want.

FEDEX can offer discounts to any customer the want.

Joey sold questionable stocks and options to anyone.

Gotta love capitalism and Joey’s hypocrisy!

Gonna buy some stuff. Thanks @DICKS!
2926 2018-02-28 12:32:05 Hiring armed prof or militia guards is so not the answer. It’s such a waste of money. No assault rifles, no bump stocks, much more effective early warning and dealing with troubled kids, lockable school doors...

2941 2018-02-28 12:26:50 #Stocks,#Indexes SPX rising after its recent major top signal may reflect its 84 stocks also in the NDX, so that the top signal expressed that for the stocks unique to SPX, while the average was pulled higher by the NDX stocks. So, NDX "ascendance" is more accurately NDX...

2944 2018-02-28 12:26:45 They've never even carried bump stocks tho
2945 2018-02-28 12:26:37 I'd appreciate if you toned down the scaremongering. "Assault-style rifle" would be a semi-auto rifle. Bump stocks only work with these. Also, hi-cap magazines become a non-issue if your gun isn't semi-auto. They only work with semi-auto AR pattern rifles.

77% support a ban on bump stocks

2971 2018-02-28 12:09:21 Four steps toward ending the slaughter: 1. Ban assault weapons and bump stocks; 2. require robust background checks; 3. impose these rules on gun shows; 4. arm school administrators and teachers.

2984 2018-02-28 12:02:02 In his memory....yiu should ban bump stocks and all weapons of war from being in civilian hands. Not even judge Scalia would protect weapons of war in civilian hands in court for the NRA it's not happening and it never will is not protected under the Second Amendment

3030 2018-02-28 11:39:51 I have an idea that might work for both sides of the gun control debate, i suggest adding bump stocks and assult weapons to the NFA list so they are still legal to own but are subject to extreme background checks, a federal tax stamp, a lot of paperwork, and up to a year wait.
3031 2018-02-28 11:38:04 Just heard you speak on radio, that you are willing to maybe possibly consider banning bump stocks if studies show that could be helpful in preventing violence. A wee tiny step towards sensible safety, but a big step for someone regarded as bought by #NRA.  #BanAssaultRifles

3045 2018-02-28 11:31:03 @NRA asked the government to review bump stocks and called for stricter regulations on them after the Vegas shooting. Also, car manufacturers recall due to defects. The only thing defective in all these shootings is the user. Who issues that recall?
3046 2018-02-28 11:30:56 Yes one could park surplus cash in good quality stocks and keep it for long-term horizon.
3047 2018-02-28 11:30:32 .@realdonaldtrump Will @potus raise the gun age to 21, like he said, Ban Bump Stocks, like he said, Comprehensive background checks, like he said.

3064 2018-02-28 11:18:57 Keep in mind current market conditions are moving stocks more both up & down and that is called volatility. When stocks sell off, that is called a down day in the market. Don't be confused when reporters conflate the two and refer to sell offs as *volatility*.

3109 2018-02-28 10:48:32 In the spirit of being a more effective activist I want to share something about "selling the stock" or "divestment" of a bad acting company.

It doesn't work, and can even *help* the company buy back stock.  For proof, see the experience of tobacco stocks.

Boycott instead.

3138 2018-02-28 10:25:33 On a #Fundamental basis, companies with strong business models & financials & valuation matrix which offers a better risk reward ratio can be utilised to identify good stocks.

3141 2018-02-28 10:25:02 The NRA does have a history of throwing certain groups of gunowners under the bus to get what they want. Hughes Amendment anyone? Its ironic, that if it wouldn't have passed, bump stocks wouldn't even be a thing.
3142 2018-02-28 10:23:47 Many on the “one side” accept handgun/shotgun/hunting rifle ownership. Still haven’t convinced me anyone needs rapid fire assault style weapons, large capacity magazines, bump stocks, etc. Self defense, yes. Capacity for carnage, no. Why is that so hard to accept Ari?
3143 2018-02-28 10:22:22 The NRA’s statement says that bump stocks should be “subject to additional regulations.” Not banned, and of course as a result its lackeys in Congress have not moved to ban them. If the NRA can’t even agree at this point to a ban, it won’t agree to any reasonable regs

3149 2018-02-28 10:19:20 I don’t understand you. You call it bull but it is happening is it not?  Bump stocks make a rifle near automatic and he has already rolled the ball to outlaw them. Clinton, Bush’s and obama didn’t. Now asking for more background checks. You appear to be pushing the bull here.

3151 2018-02-28 10:14:17 I'm betting that because of the costs involved, the Government would pull what Massachusetts is doing where they declared bump stocks contraband by law first and then have no Constitional obligation to pay you for your seized property.

3153 2018-02-28 10:12:56 Think I will also adopt a similar approach to yourself. Will start posting stocks that I have a mt/lt approach too and if a sensible conversation can be struck up then I will look to follow that person and see where it leads Plus as you say use twitter at certain times of the day
3154 2018-02-28 10:11:58 @bloombergquint #BQMutualFundShow. #BQLive @_nirajshah @ICICIPruMF Why is market building such high growth in consumer stocks ? But income per capita is not rising steadily. Is the growth acceleration due to rise in disposable income? Is it sustainable?
3155 2018-02-28 10:10:13 Restricting bump stocks and military grade semi-automatic/automatic weapons will help — but I am convinced the uptick esp over the last 5-10 years is fueled by something more — that data needs to be exposed.
3156 2018-02-28 10:10:03 This is why I’m ‘advocating’ bringing back the the Stocks.  Maybe a little public shaming with a face full of produce would do the trick.
3157 2018-02-28 10:09:55 Morning Wednesday news: China stocks slide as nation`s manufacturing PMI hits a 20-month low, Dollar holds steady and Gold hovers at a two-week low. Powell’s comments on Tuesday fueled speculation that the Fed Open Market Committee will push through rate rises this year.

3161 2018-02-28 10:06:38 Actually car manufacturers recall vehicles or parts when deemed as part of or sole reason of motor vehicle injuries or death. Removal of models is also a very reasonable actions when market forces deem so. So why not remove bump stocks and semi-automatic rifles too?

3174 2018-02-28 09:56:51 But, to clarify- I DO think bump stocks should be restricted.
3175 2018-02-28 09:55:50 I read Alphabet is a "holding company" - they make it sound like they "hold" other companies like a parent company. But actually it sounds more like they're a middle man holding stocks, property & other financial assets for these other companies.

- Improving the NICS
- Implementing universal background checks

The South: wrap up warm, ensure food stocks are high and only travel if essential.

The North: Bob on a coat.

3419 2018-02-28 07:00:57 I don't  think that anyone really cares about bump stocks.   All they did in Vegas was spoil the shooters aim and make his rifles jam.    Probably reduced the casualty count.   I won't let them on my range or my classes.

3422 2018-02-28 07:00:47 Dear @RedmiIndia, There are millions waiting for this phone. To be honest now I'm having thoughts of buying something else. If you can atleast make some quality stocks and conduct a REAL flash sale, you could easily benefit a lot. 7 days for a flash sale and only 300k phones? 
3423 2018-02-28 07:00:12 So not really behind the curve. As market starts pricing possibility of 4 Fed's hikes, the added risk that inflation fails to materialize and growth softens. Amidst an hawkish Fed. Not exactly a good combo for stocks. Nasdaq -1.2%. HY wider. USD seems the winner

3428 2018-02-28 06:55:28 Trump is already putting the age up to 21 a ban on bump stocks and working to put people in to defend schools so what are you all talking about.
3429 2018-02-28 06:55:25 The share prices of several companies dropped due to exclusive dividend payments. Owing to that many investors did not purchase stocks. This resulted in stock prices coming down. Average investor should invest regardless of the market movement #lka

We need to ban all semi-automatics and bump fire stocks that turn semi-autos into full-autos.
No reasonable person thinks this is a bad idea. Only NRA-bought-and-paid-for politicians do.

3589 2018-02-28 05:24:00 I agree with your logic, just not how to respond. I think bump stocks are stupid and should be regulated like other full-auto mechanisms. Allowable mag capacity is arbitrary. Apparently 10 is okay, but 15 is not? If I only load 5, am I more virtuous?

3612 2018-02-28 05:11:38 "Assault weapons" clearly isn't what you think it is. 3 items on a list on a rifle including but not limited to, bayonets, pistol grips, folding stocks, telescopic stocks, forward grip, laser sight, flash suppressor. You just look ignorant to people who do know...

3632 2018-02-28 04:57:52 In short, the law has already been passed. It’s up to the ATF, which is a part of the executive, to determine if bump stocks adhere to the law. In 2010 the ATF eventually approved the sale of bump stocks. And the ATF, still, essentially, has to power to revoke the approval.

3635 2018-02-28 04:56:53 You held your own girl. You made some great points even though he refused to speak on anything of substance. Rate of fire with bump stocks? How is that relevant to the conversation?
3636 2018-02-28 04:56:35 Screw the no compromise NRA that won't even consider that just maybe assualt weapons with bump stocks & large clips might be a big part of the problem causing mass killings and maiming. The NRA has 5 million members. The rest of the country 317 million people. It's all about $$

3642 2018-02-28 04:52:19 IT's all over! He said to ban bump stocks! Final betrayal!
3643 2018-02-28 04:51:34 Dear @SEBI_India It would be appropriate if pushing stocks on Twitter is banned. Most pump and dump happens through social media. Do not put financial penalty alone. Have a minimum prison term also
3644 2018-02-28 04:51:19 Many mass shooters who have been stopped have been stopped while reloading. Magazine limits also undermine modifications like bump-stocks etc. since the higher rate of fire is punctuated by the need to reload. It's pretty sound policy, honestly.

3648 2018-02-28 04:50:19 I don't really care about bump stocks. If autos are illegal then things that makes them auto should be too. Plus autos blow to shoot.

Can only happen if the game is spoiled..
3661 2018-02-28 04:42:03 Bull trap imo. US stocks taking a hit. I think we’re in for anotha dip.
3662 2018-02-28 04:40:53 And so Soros trade is short stocks and long US govt bonds. 

I think he’s right on unsustainable debt. 

Regarding capital flight, he does not discuss the impact from the unwinding of corporate RMB carry trades. 

Regarding reserves, he does not discuss minimum FX reserves.

3677 2018-02-28 04:28:11 How is the @NRA responsible for the Parkland shooting? Wasn’t it the @FBI and local police department that dropped the ball on tips!?
Vegas shooter-Obama signed many EO’s on gun regulations yet didn’t touch bump stocks even after the NRA brought up issues with it!

3679 2018-02-28 04:27:38 I like to think of it more like gold. It’s a great store of value. I would also strong bet that when the next bear market appears for stocks bitcoin will join gold as a new safe haven. I don’t like the comparison with land as land is able to generate value.
3680 2018-02-28 04:25:19 Yeah as long as my right to own a rifle for mine and others protection isn’t infringed. Also like I’ve said, better background checks banning bump stocks I can agree with
3681 2018-02-28 04:24:55 Iirc US stocks held up though volatility ratcheted up for a while. Bonds took a hit. Intl equities suffered, Japan gave back the Abe boost.
3682 2018-02-28 04:24:43 Goldman Sachs sees Nifty target at 11,600; Recommends stocks like RIL, BPCL, HDFC Bank, Eicher, TVS, L&T, Avenue Supermarts and Infosys
3683 2018-02-28 04:24:31 I think you’re downplaying what design innovations they’ve made. In the effort to make it modular, it’s basically a lego gun that lets people make weapons that are as much power as military grade, minus full auto. Do we agree that bump stocks make that line even thinner?
3684 2018-02-28 04:24:11 #Parkland was a #DeepState retaliation strike for the FISA memo.
Trump knows this. I think he's offering small concessions on stocks/age limit for guns with the understanding no more innocent people are murdered in false flags. These people are sick
#QAnon #FollowTheWhiteRabbit
3685 2018-02-28 04:22:51 What about gun control?  AR 15s and AK 47s, bump stocks, DON'T NEED TO BE IN JUST ANYONE'S HANDS.  Military only.  Age limits.  Licensing, just like a car, only more so.  Defending schools & mental health ARE NOT ENOUGH.  Eliminate the source.  NRA isn't in control of the US.
3686 2018-02-28 04:21:20 Bump stocks, or even full auto rifles (which civilians can NOT easily attain) have been involved in ONE active shooter situation, Vegas. An AR-15 is not more dangerous than any other rifle. ARs are even used to hunt. There is literally nothing bad about them.

3694 2018-02-28 04:15:03 Alright
3695 2018-02-28 04:13:05 Bump stocks convert a firearm into a nearly fully automatic weapon.  They should be BANNED.
3696 2018-02-28 04:12:58 Is this first time stocks for guns have fallen post a shooting?
3697 2018-02-28 04:12:21 Let’s give the Socialist/Communist background checks and banning bump stocks, but NOTHING else. 

Get rid of “Gun Free Zones”, that is like an open invitation to go in and kill people without fear of being shot!
3698 2018-02-28 04:11:22 DT’s not knowledgeable enough about gun reform to know this so I bet they told him he’d be safe pretending he could ban bump stocks (using an executive order). After all, he said we can’t just pass “feel good” measures...so obviously that’s exactly what he’s doing. #LiarInChief
3699 2018-02-28 04:11:07 Banning bump stocks has zero effect on gun violence. What a waste of time and resources!
3700 2018-02-28 04:10:20 Yes penny stocks (assuming you are only talking about cannabis stock right now) at 52 week highs might retract lol. Yes we all need charts to tell us this ;) best of luck with all your chart reading. Tell me when the bottom is in
3701 2018-02-28 04:07:51 And yet, corporations are using their tax windfalls to buy back their own stocks and to buy up their competition all while laying off employees.  Furthermore, stock market continues to fall.  Thanks, Trump.
3702 2018-02-28 04:07:20 Listen to what’s being said by Paul Ryan and other Repubs. Then, listen to the change in Trump’s tone. They will do nothing about bump stocks, or AR’s, or raising the age to 21. The NRA buy is in. Bag ‘em up!!
3703 2018-02-28 04:07:18 So much fun to debate direction of #stocks but as a #financialsdvisor most important to block out noise, stick to long term strategy.  Must stop clients from making horrible decisions whenever next downturn happens. #BehavioralEconomics
3704 2018-02-28 04:07:06 -Increasing the age from 18 to 21
-Ban sale AR-15 and all assault rifles. vets endorsing this change 
-Ban bump stocks
—inclusive background checks for felons & mentally ill .
These steps would have prevented guns getting in the hands of illegals and no value to legal gun owners
3705 2018-02-28 04:06:55 DO NOT GET DISTRACTED BY THIS BS. How many days has it been since @POTUS listened  to the students/families at Parkland FL and parents of @NewtownAction  and now he is backing off on bump stocks, etc. SHAME ON YOU @POTUS. All NRA INFLUENCE!

3707 2018-02-28 04:05:26 wrong again there bud, he mentioned arming teachers if they so wanted, banning bump stocks, and bettering background checks with emphasis on mental illness. however the survivors march against guns sparked all this again

3710 2018-02-28 04:02:46 Will you hire me if I drop out of university right now and move to BC? I would literally sell all my cannabis related stocks that I'm holding since 2016 and move to BC next month and work for you.
3711 2018-02-28 04:02:33 I looked into getting one, but they are more of a novelty than anything. Having fired actual automatic real assault weapons in the Army, not the made up BS that everyone is referring to. I'd say banning of bump stocks without an FFL would be fine.
3712 2018-02-28 04:02:15 What sells more guns is trying to pass more gun laws.....if the 2018 assault weapon ban gets through the house all it will do is make "assault" weapons fly of the shelf to secdary market for 5 times as much, gun manufacturers stocks will soar and profits will sky rocket.

3721 2018-02-28 03:58:57 This is not a pissing contest.  There are a heck of a lot of different types of semi-automatics.  99% of those who own guns would never use them against another person. Whereas I agree no bump stocks, no automatic weapons and only 10 bullet magazines, don't punish everyone.
3722 2018-02-28 03:58:57 Once viewed as the darlings of Wall Street, swamp drain pump stocks have plummeted.

3749 2018-02-28 03:45:06 Trump undid a measure aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of mentally ill people. Also, still no ban on bump stocks although it seems to be inching towards that one finally. Those are just two sensible laws that should be a no brainer. Certain weapons need to be banned, too.
3750 2018-02-28 03:44:46 Yeah, its sad that 'invest' has become the mantra superceding 'providing safe, secure, warm, dry & affordable accommodation' for people & their families. Invest in stocks/bonds/shares or venture-capital or a bank - houses are for living in.
3751 2018-02-28 03:44:03 So, the fact that he wants congress to do something, pushing them. That he wants to raise the age to 21, eliminate bump stocks and other things is doing nothing. You need to go to school and take a history lesson Prez don’t make or write the laws kiddo!

3780 2018-02-28 03:33:59 Amy , no disrespect. But you may not understand how stocks work. Centralizing a companies stock is a good thing. It means the business is health and doesn't need shareholders to prop it up. So now all those earnings are being taxed instead of being payed out to shareholders

3787 2018-02-28 03:30:36 yes it is but raising the age limit to buy guns and banning bump stocks are nothing more than punshing law abiding gun owners please reconsider, the Dems want to ban all semi-autos dont let them do it #GunControlDoesNotWork
3788 2018-02-28 03:30:30 Well Trump is in favor of federal ban on bump stocks and raising the age to purchase long rifles to 21.Again Congress has to act.We need to quit being 100% left or 100% right and work together to do what's right. Prob is as you said, more concerned with reelection than fixing it.

3793 2018-02-28 03:28:48 Yeah and now the buy back of stocks which I'm certain the treasonous trumps are all in on it! Collapse America so you're oligarchs can buy up American stocks and collapse America from within!

3873 2018-02-28 02:55:59 Great post. Well besides the fact that you obviously didn’t read the nra’s statement on their position on bump stocks. Honestly it’s good to google once in a while.

3875 2018-02-28 02:54:23 Today really had the feeling of a bottom coming in the juniors. Volume was massive on so many different plays. For the most part...the stocks I was tracking closed off of the lows on the day. Looking forward to shopping tomorrow as this market has some deals
3876 2018-02-28 02:54:22 Your recommendations on stocks please.
3877 2018-02-28 02:54:08 So Trump is issuing an order to get rid of Bump Stocks that were deemed legal by the Obama Administration. Who's in favor of Bump Stocks now? He's willing to move on more gun control than any previous administration but he'll get resistance from the Democrats. @realDonaldTrump
3878 2018-02-28 02:54:01 ...these gun companies are all small- and mid-cap stocks, held in mutual funds. For us, the funds were: Vanguard Market Index Fund: VIEIX; Vanguard Small Cap Index Fund: VSCIX; and TIAA-CREF Small Cap Blend Index FUND: TISBX.  We sold, and reinvested elsewhere to #BoycottNRA...
3879 2018-02-28 02:51:48 Don’t stop there...ban assault weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks & silencers, mandate states report to NICS, enact Gun Violence Restraining Orders, block Constitutional Carry
3880 2018-02-28 02:51:44 Those who understand it buy only when prices are low with the idea of selling when they are high; and they operate only in the stocks or commodities which they can move best so they may secure the highest possible rate of turnover of inventories.

3885 2018-02-28 02:50:53 Highlighted. Then we ban military grade semi auto rifles or as a compromise till the kids take over we can reduce clip sizes to reduce lethality. Also ban any modification that increases lethality ie bump stocks

3922 2018-02-28 02:41:48 Wow......Bump stocks seems like cut and dried.
3923 2018-02-28 02:41:29 Interesting that Energy stocks on $ASX all up
3924 2018-02-28 02:40:58 I'm sure he didn't realize the amendment to ban bump stocks failed today in committee.
3925 2018-02-28 02:40:57 Kotak Team has done Research, on 829 stocks above Rs 1000 crore market cap. 136 stocks are down more than 30% and 16% of the stocks are down 13% from their 52-week high. About 225 stocks or 27% are down between 20% and 30% and 328 stocks or 40% are down between 10% and 20%.
3926 2018-02-28 02:40:54 1) You would only enter stocks where the risk reward is good 2) HTF is added benefit in selection 3) Incase HTF SL is hit, that would take atleast that timeframe, monthly SL can hit only after completion of 1 month, but you will see indications on the LTF and use exit strategy
3927 2018-02-28 02:40:21 Look I’m a combat veteran, I’m very pro 2A, I’m also for stronger backgrounds checks I’m for removing bump stocks ( they are trash and no real marksman would use them in a real situation). But trying to take AR15s and rising the age to 21 isn’t going to happen.
3928 2018-02-28 02:40:13 all stocks under smapitalism will be the same price. $10.
3929 2018-02-28 02:39:19 Ban bump stocks?  We the People want "military grade weapons" banned.

If Republicans believe themselves to be Christians, how can they do "nothing" to keep these military weapons out of the hands of civilians?
--> Psalm 127:3 <--
3930 2018-02-28 02:39:05 They legally can’t say until they legally can say. Don’t worry man, I’ve followed all kinds of stocks throughout the last 25 years. Should be fine, if your worries about getting yanked, just move to your own wallet, not too hard to set up... kind of a pain.

3934 2018-02-28 02:38:14 You don't understand how stocks work, which is unfortunate if you've invested in them. You don't own any of the section of the company responsible for management and commercial decisions -- you own, by committee, a share of profits in return for assisting their solvency.
3935 2018-02-28 02:38:00 If teenagers with clear mental/anger issues, or teenagers in general could not get semi-automatics, bump-stocks, etc. (or quite frankly guns at all) school mass shootings, suicide deaths would go down.  Not gone entirely I know.  Hope that clears up where I'm coming from.
3936 2018-02-28 02:37:45 Automatic weapons are already illegal. Semi-automatic weapons fire one bullet for each single trigger pull. lefties want to Ban semiautomatics. a bump stock sorta converts a semi-automatic to automatic. Trump wants to ban bump stocks.
3937 2018-02-28 02:37:30 I don’t know the answer to that to be honest. AR-15, bump stocks, tell me why a civilian needs a semi automatic weapon? Or a gun even remotely similar to what’s used in these shootings. I don’t think cops should have them. There is no reason for them. There are things we can do.
3938 2018-02-28 02:37:24 For a semi.  which is why semis should be more closely relegated.  Bump stocks weren't even banned until this shooting, even when the Vegas shooting occurred in October

3943 2018-02-28 02:35:30 So do we know why they beat down Chinese stocks harder today?
3944 2018-02-28 02:34:53 Many gun owners agree it’s time for reasonable restrictions on assault weapons, bump stocks, as well as better background checks. I do think it is reasonable to #BoycottNRA.
3945 2018-02-28 02:34:52 So…he’s going to argue for assault weapons ban and extensive handgun buybacks, and be satisfied when they outlaw bump stocks?
3946 2018-02-28 02:34:40 How relevant is this? In 2000, margin debt was at a relative high like now, but most of the margin debt was in the most speculative stocks, i.e., Nasdaq, 100 which subsequently went down 83%. Now it is more than double what it was then--don't think it is evenly spread across mkt
3947 2018-02-28 02:33:53 Ban automatic weapons and bump stocks. No citizen should have these. What for? So you can have money coming in from the NRA? How much does a life cost @SpeakerRyan?
3948 2018-02-28 02:32:55 You are not forced to give out 26% discount to anyone, right? I sold your stocks and BOYCOTTING you going forward.
3949 2018-02-28 02:32:52 About dividend growth stocks? For two reasons. 1) because there is no evidence that dividend growth sorts produce excess returns and 2) because it is not an asset class, and yet is listed as an asset class in the Wealthfront risk parity whitepaper.
3950 2018-02-28 02:32:10 You don’t know me little guy. I’m confident I know MUCH more about the market than you do.  The fact is, your theory that #UAL and #DAL stocks would be affected has fallen on its face.
3951 2018-02-28 02:32:10 That's already covered under class 3 firearms. If you mean mods like bump stocks I fully support banning them. A person doesn't need a stock to do that though, with a little practice you can fire like that without any mods.
3952 2018-02-28 02:32:04 I really dont care. Simply pointing out that according to the stocks, fedex was down, not up.
3953 2018-02-28 02:31:40 The so called bump stocks are now essentially illegal in my state. Waiting for the ban on open carry. Give them an inch they’ll take a mile.
3954 2018-02-28 02:31:28 Keep the wrong guns out of the wrong hands?  Mental health component would help to keep guns out of wrong hands.  Universal, updated backround checks would also help keep out of wrong hands.  Finally, I do support ban on bunp stocks and semi-automatic rifles like gun used in Flo
3955 2018-02-28 02:31:11 They're trying to give us a crumb, like banishing gun stocks, but these #ParklandStudents won't let them get away with it. They want more, something stronger.
@kharyp @Everytown #ParklandStudentsSpeak
3956 2018-02-28 02:30:52 Facts Pocahontas!! Mention the bump stocks. They were approved by the ATF in 2010 under the Obama administration. BTW - you and your cronies, on both sides of the isle, owe all Americans 20 trillion. Do you have any in your back accounts??
3957 2018-02-28 02:30:49 Hard to enforce that though unless you want the police randomly entering houses of gun owners and searching for bump-stocks specifically. As for loopholes, those are in most every law.
3958 2018-02-28 02:30:06 Hes a Super strong data guy...but his newest 10 mil deal with a shady penny stock company wasn’t a smart move.. its only gonna put him under a microscope. My neighbor did penny stocks then one day the FBI came and took everything from him cuz of pump & dumps
3959 2018-02-28 02:30:01 Gun reform =/= banning guns. But of course, some members of the #NRA would have you believe that. What do law-abiding citizens have to fear from stricter background checks, banning of bump stocks and closing of the gun show/person to person loophole.
3960 2018-02-28 02:29:52 Dans le reportage, que des faits, incontestables, graves, dramatiques, et la clique de clowns, au lieu d'en parler, préfère s'en prendre au messager au lieu de condamner l'expansion de l'islamisme et ses conséquences..il va falloir acheter des stocks de tondeuses à la libération.

3962 2018-02-28 02:28:55 fair question and why we made our rating system. But I would contend you can lose plenty of $ trading stocks.
3963 2018-02-28 02:28:52 As a responsible gun owner I want to see bump stocks done away with. Otherwise I tend to agree to the broad statement
3964 2018-02-28 02:28:03 No only wrong but no one is saying the NRA pulled the trigger; rather it has blocked meaningful gun reform that would have prevented these shootings or made them less lethal. That many months after Las Vegas bump stocks are legal is a testament to this

3967 2018-02-28 02:27:20 If my understanding is correct: under current law bump stocks are not illegal per se & thus can be owned. However, once it is attached to a weapon it is a modificaton of that weapon that is illegal.

3978 2018-02-28 02:24:01 It is as reasonable 2 pass laws to prevent access to AR 15’s & bump stocks while strengthening background checks as it is 2 pass laws regulating use of seat belts, underage drinking, & access to porn. #neveragain #GunControlNow @Emma4Change why is congress afraid to pass laws!?

3993 2018-02-28 02:18:59 Nice corporate speak, Fed Ex; you forget that the NRA discriminates against innocent people by lobbying for military rifles, bump stocks and allows people to be gunned down at will. May UPS eat your lunch.
3994 2018-02-28 02:18:49 The "perfect is the enemy of good crowd" will take us down the same doomed path as always. Liberals celebrating defeat as victory - AGAIN. Doing republicans' heavy lifting for them. GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS and GET RID OF ASSAULT WEAPONS. Banning bump stocks is NOT a victory.
3995 2018-02-28 02:18:36 *Hazama voice*

Pot of greed, which lets me draw 2 chain stocks

... Any second now.
3996 2018-02-28 02:18:09 It's there. This is only the first paragraph. Bump stocks are mentioned specifically, as well.
3997 2018-02-28 02:17:49 I don’t have problems with metal dectors, armed SROs, reinforced doors. Not a fan of arming teachers, they need to focus on educating our children. However, we do have vehicles banned from ownership. I think in place of gun ban, clip size restrictions and ban bump stocks
3998 2018-02-28 02:17:15 @FXS_Stocks_FR thanks for the follow, Dukascopy & have a great Wednesday!
3999 2018-02-28 02:17:05 Trade Setup: I.T Stocks Likely To Outperform
4000 2018-02-28 02:16:28 I actual own a couple stocks of FedEx lol.
4001 2018-02-28 02:15:36 So I made 15$ off my penny stocks today so basically you could say I’m no longer ballin on a budget
4002 2018-02-28 02:14:36 Sure get rid of bump stocks if you want but an AR-15 only fires as fast as you can pull a trigger, same as a pistol operates. Fully automatic weapons ARE BANNED.
4003 2018-02-28 02:13:59 Regarding Trumps support for banning bump stocks, remember when he said he cared about the Dreamers? How did that go?

Oh, right.
4004 2018-02-28 02:13:51 STOCKS TO WATCH :
DALMIA BHARAT AND PIRAMAL to have emerged as highest bidder for Binani Cement
ICICI Bk Working With Cap Lenders To Gitanjali Grp Along With Other Banks In Consortium. doesn't have exposure to Nirav Modi
CIPLA Signs Deal With Roche Pharma
4005 2018-02-28 02:13:46 It's a little way too late to not care...  like she already had the baby late ... but at same time, trusting Russia with wheat stocks has risks
4006 2018-02-28 02:13:00 You’re clearly tweeting in riddles. My main goal is to help people increase their net worth. Owning stocks is fundamental to achieving this goal.
4007 2018-02-28 02:12:37 Went from paying bonds to owning stocks.
4008 2018-02-28 02:12:27 Working on spreader bars and stocks! Pics to follow!
4009 2018-02-28 02:12:26 And bump stocks need to be banned. Period.
4010 2018-02-28 02:12:12 I’m ordering all mine on Thursday from Amazon’s. I’m buying their stocks too!
4011 2018-02-28 02:12:07 F&O Ban Stocks 28-02-2018:

    In Ban: Fortis Healthcare, JP Associates, Oriental Bank of Commerce

    New In Ban: None

    Out Of Ban: None
4012 2018-02-28 02:10:49 The requirements are not consistent from state to state. 

Mental health, open carry, ccw, bump stocks, stand ur ground...laws vary a lot state to state.

I'm asking for consistency and something we can all agree to (even  not 100% happy but reasonable).
4013 2018-02-28 02:09:29 2 for 1; ban bump stocks & ban Trump fake talks.
4014 2018-02-28 02:09:26 The sad part about it is I am addicted to Amazon here and in Canada AND I love my Amazon stocks! Shame on me!
4015 2018-02-28 02:07:30 NRA are protecting gun manufacturers. Raising the age, not allowing bump stocks are not ok to the people making big $ on selling to these young people. All about the money
4016 2018-02-28 02:07:22 $rvl, Revelo Resources, borrows $1.5m from Rick Rule's private company (just announced). Meeting still pending March 19. Hmmm, one can only speculate... #copper #gold #tsx #tsxv #cse #stocks #onetowatch
4017 2018-02-28 02:06:52 If I short stocks is that income taxable?
4018 2018-02-28 02:06:42 U.S. stocks sold off for the first time in three sessions and Treasuries  slumped as investors weighed the potential for added interest rate  hikes this year following Powell’s assessment that the economy is  strengthening and inflation could be gaining speed.
4019 2018-02-28 02:06:27 Yo, go follow @meme_stocks! It's lit. I'm working on it with @Minorspaceguy11...
4020 2018-02-28 02:05:34 These idiot law makers need to stop trying to mess with my rights as an #american .. even you @realDonaldTrump .. what it starts at bump stocks next is sights? Grips, magazines, guns .. yeah cut the shit ..
4021 2018-02-28 02:05:25 Not true. Law was in existence before Obama, his administration determined bump stocks were allowed by the law. It’s pretty clear the law allows them—he had no legal basis to ban them. Reading a law accurately is not “approval”. Talk to Congress.
4022 2018-02-28 02:04:48 Man! We were in around .25 now it's over $1.30 ridiculous lol
4023 2018-02-28 02:04:23 Trade him while his stocks high
4024 2018-02-28 02:03:19 Is there any hope he brings back Pro Stocks?
4025 2018-02-28 02:03:08 Don't overdo it... If he gets more comfortable then he will buy more of his overvalued stocks 
4026 2018-02-28 02:02:46 What happens to the company they buy as far as stocks are concerned?
4027 2018-02-28 02:02:34 How many more mass killings do we have to endure?? The kids are right !!! #BanAssaultWeapons, high round magazines and bump stocks!!! These weapons seem to be the weapon of choice of these mentally deranged killers. Follow the example of Australia. #BanAssaultWeaponsNow
4028 2018-02-28 02:01:57 That's okay, stocks are soooo 2007. 

We're all blockchain/crypto experts now.
4029 2018-02-28 02:01:54 All of the companies that received billions from #GOPTaxScam have spent 44 times more on buying back their company stocks and taking  money themselves than they have on giving back to American workers in form of bonus or wage increases.
4030 2018-02-28 02:00:30 #Stocks,#Indexes Further evidence of ascendance of NDX: going back to 06.2016, SPX top signals ALWAYS accompanied by NDX same, and both indexes declined. Now we have SPX top signal ALONE, and no decline, so far. Points to absent NDX signal as cause. Interesting.
4031 2018-02-28 02:00:29 Ok then, yeah, we shouldn't take a look at gun control laws - mentally ill, 18 year olds, bump stocks, etc. because clearly there is no problem with our current gun culture. Pistol-packin' PTAs is all we need.  

Or we could have a open, reasoned conversation...whatevs.
4032 2018-02-28 01:59:27 Wow. What does it say about your soul when you value bump stocks over the lives of kids.   There are no words. 

Human life has ZERO value to this man.
4033 2018-02-28 01:59:26 Second amendment is not going away.  No “movement” of the moment will change  an inalienable right. Look at all of the companies this “movement” is attacking. Their stocks are not affected, or they are increasing in value.  Fair-minded citizens do not like innocent people blamed.
4034 2018-02-28 01:58:48 My dad didn't give me "the talk" until I was 19 and in my Jr year of college. Every time Trump caves in after weeks of pressure to some tiny common sense thing (like banning bump stocks) I remember that moment, and in both cases my thought is "too late, already got fucked"
4035 2018-02-28 01:58:31 Bump stocks are not illegal, and Cruz was law abiding until the moment he killed the first student.

We can do more.
4036 2018-02-28 01:58:24 got into an argument with the wife about bump stocks. I think they are pieces of shit that are just made to get around full auto restrictions and should be banned while she is saying its the people's god damn right to have them. then again she thinks the full auto ban is stupid
4037 2018-02-28 01:57:46 I’m with Dave. I’m not smart enough or have enough time to pick stocks and the like. Doesn’t matter what companies are in the fund, as long as it is making $$.
4038 2018-02-28 01:57:21 Fuck me, i dont understand why people get attached to stocks.

4040 2018-02-28 01:56:40 Where is the infrastructure plan?  Why is Puerto Rico still without power?  Why is it so hard to ban assault rifles, bump stocks, and close the gun show loophole?  Why is it so hard to pass DACA when the majority of Americans want it?

4043 2018-02-28 01:55:59 What a difference a month makes when it comes to Americans' outlook for stocks
4044 2018-02-28 01:55:45 Slide fire stocks also greatly increase the likelihood of jamming. It’s almost a guarantee. They are highly unreliable.

4046 2018-02-28 01:55:28 So outlaw bump stocks.
4047 2018-02-28 01:55:18 VFTSX is the ticker..."The index is composed of the stocks of companies that have been screened for certain social and environmental criteria." Not a bad fund....Apple, Google, FB, JNJ, lots of banks. Very low expense ratio....Hmmmm.....

4051 2018-02-28 01:53:11 And the stock market dramatically crashed again today. GOOD JOB! How can YOU claim any consumer confidence when the stocks CRASH across the board. FAKE NEWS!
4052 2018-02-28 01:52:08 No - it doesn’t take a constitutional amendment to ban bump stocks or assault rifles. There’s no mention of either in the constitution.
4053 2018-02-28 01:51:16 See he got it.  Not my best but was trying to lighten the mood.
4054 2018-02-28 01:51:11 No. Ask more questions. Challenge us when we recommend stocks. We'll all learn more this way.

4058 2018-02-28 01:46:58 Ah so Brad is using his marketing skills to pump up penny stocks. Must be remarkably similar to pumping up a reality TV star.
4059 2018-02-28 01:46:05 Count how many stocks you have taken from 2014 till now including 3DS
4060 2018-02-28 01:45:39 Bump stocks are the sacrificial lamb.
4061 2018-02-28 01:45:03 I need to buy stocks in Honey Grow, I LOVE THIS !
4062 2018-02-28 01:44:38 "You can't buy what is popular and do well." #Buffett. 
When buying unpopular #stocks, you must expect what the market does not! Plus, capture the change in market prices, if and when market finally realizes it, all while avoiding losses,. 
Good luck!
4063 2018-02-28 01:44:32 That guy was not alone, and big reason they will not release the countless videos through out vegas. That will clearly prove that!  Actual machine guns were used not some gimmick bump stocks as they claim and only show 1 gun with it on it.
4064 2018-02-28 01:44:18 All this technical crap means little, right?  It is a killing machine. And, it us capable of becoming a worse one. Bump stocks and extended mags.
4065 2018-02-28 01:44:16 I got some other stocks in my portfolio I want them to boycott!

4068 2018-02-28 01:42:48 my producer?
4069 2018-02-28 01:42:19 Just to educate you.  AR was made for the public first in 54. It wasn't bought by military, Air Force, until 61, in the military select fire M-16. The military style rifle before that was an m1 grande and m-14. Both with wooden stocks.
4070 2018-02-28 01:41:58 The issue when your producer makes you defend the Hot take!  Nothing suggests that this team in its current make up can beat a top 4 seed in the playoffs. Brogdon and Delly are not difference makers in a 7 game series like you suggest. Next year is the year.
4071 2018-02-28 01:41:42 anything is possible, never make certainty arguments on stocks, because that's just a lie and or lying to yourself.
4072 2018-02-28 01:41:22 For your first point, no. You don’t need a gun to use your voice. You certainly do need a gun to protect your right to use your voice though.  Now, I don’t agree with bump stocks either way. And everywhere in the US they should of already been illegal because of federal law.

4077 2018-02-28 01:39:22 The 2nd Amendment is about a well regulated militia, it’s not about civilians being able to possess bump stocks and assault weapons. Ban them all.
4078 2018-02-28 01:38:42 Bull shit again Dean
I guess Russian espionage to tough for you 
You understood it in August what changed your  mind
To complicated, how about bump stocks or universal background checks do you have a public opinion on those issues
Ittybitty balls
4079 2018-02-28 01:38:15 KEEP AN EYE ON THE STOCKS OF THE COMPANIES BOYCOTTING THE NRA! IM TURNING ON THE GARDEN HOSE FOR THE SLIP & SLIDE PARTY!
4080 2018-02-28 01:38:00 Directly from the White House email, "The President specifically mentioned better regulating of bump stocks, addressing mental health concerns, and improving early warning response systems to help diminish the risk of violence." Make sure the current administration understands...
4081 2018-02-28 01:37:59 @RepStefanik Bump stocks.......the only thing the N.R.A. lets you do. Meanwhile, automatic rifles killing innocent school children still doesn't come into your agenda! Disgraceful Representative Stefanic.
4082 2018-02-28 01:37:48 Trump only had to have one lunch with the NRA and he caved on a 21 year old requirement...what's left?  Bump stocks?  Paul Ryan thinks stricter background checks are a violation of due process, so that idea is dead.
4083 2018-02-28 01:36:55 The Bears are out to eat up the bulls today! What a tank day for Stocks! Hope your day was better than mine! SkyNet1 buy: $SKX 41.15, Sells: $HST 18.60, $XXII.

4084 2018-02-28 01:36:52 Thanks for your tweet. I am just curious on how rubicon investing thesis works for the above two stocks which are bleeding heavily and searching for a turnaround. Right now I see a potential buyout.
4085 2018-02-28 01:36:39 I am @NRA member / gun owner, and I support 2A rights, but ALSO strongly support common sense gun laws (universal bg checks, ban assault rifles, bump stocks…)
Trump = focus on “mental health” bc that way F-All will actually get done. So insincere. #complexity #StatesforGunSafety
4086 2018-02-28 01:36:16 Trade off bump stocks for a pledge Barbara Streisand will shut up and get mental help.
4087 2018-02-28 01:34:54 Or maybe get long if thesis is stocks will get crushed as baby boomers liquidate as they retire?
4088 2018-02-28 01:34:18 I suspect that they deployed an emergency fix without adequately testing it. But the bump stocks are the key to understanding the clumsy patch-up job we saw over the course of the day
4089 2018-02-28 01:34:14 Advising investing an emergency fund fully in stocks seems irresponsible
4090 2018-02-28 01:33:47 We go from one artificial asset bubble to another. Dot Com companies and their stocks to housing now back to stocks.
4091 2018-02-28 01:33:29 Not to mention, nobody really cares if bump stocks are around because they make you horribly inaccurate, what they do care about is the precedent that sets for banning say a foregrip, a scope (1x, 2x, 4x, 8x), hell I've seen people argue how bad slings are.
4092 2018-02-28 01:33:04 My trader friend (stocks and spread bets) recommends the Al Brooks trading price action books- three 400 page books-  start with trends.  I’m reading the first one definitely not the easiest. If you get any recommendations let me know!  I’m 1 week into my TA education.
4093 2018-02-28 01:33:01 Yup it faded really quick. Maybe soon my average is .30 hope it gets to .40+ will add more under .25 but hope it doesn't go that low
4094 2018-02-28 01:32:51 *Ahem*
@HawleyMO your position on bump stocks is to the left of @BarackObama and @EricHolder
#2AShallNotBeInfringed #2A
4095 2018-02-28 01:32:48 Maybe also ban men with a history of domestic abuse from gun ownership, oh and also ban crazy assault rifles and high magazine rifles, bump stocks, and oh, while you are at it ban the stupid idea of teachers being armed. Teachers need to teach, not shoot students.
4096 2018-02-28 01:32:05 Hawkish   Closing technical signal:  the sell off in stocks allowed Mortgage Bonds to close off worst levels and actually up from the later pricing windows. It MAY be worth #Float brand new clients   The Fed Funds Futures market is all but certain. 3 rate hikes in 2018
4097 2018-02-28 01:31:45 4. Diversify your stocks. Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket. If the stock market goes down, you don’t want all of your stocks to go down. #StockMarket #financialwellness #debtfree
4098 2018-02-28 01:31:35 This is exactly the direction we need. It’s delusional to think that AR-15’s or any assault weapon, bump stocks, etc. should be legal.  Do your job!!
4099 2018-02-28 01:31:34 Unless it involves banning AR-15 type assault rifles, large clips and bump stocks, you wasted their time. NRA got your tongue?
4100 2018-02-28 01:31:32 European stocks slipped on Tuesday, taking their cue from the US after the new @federalreserve boss gave more-hawkish than expected testimony to Congress on the health of the US economy.
4101 2018-02-28 01:30:53 BACK GROUND CHECKS ARE GOOD, LEAVE THE GUNS AND BUMP STOCKS ALONE. YOU ARE ROLLO\ING OVER TO THE DEMOC"RATS" THIS IS APEOPLE THAT FAILED TO DO THEIR JOB PROBLEM. FIX THE PEOPLE.
4102 2018-02-28 01:30:35 3. If your company offers a stock plan, sign up right away. They may offer stocks at a discounted rates, which gives you an automatic return. #debtfree #financialwellness #Income
4103 2018-02-28 01:29:51 US stocks fell on Tuesday, as the new Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell emphasised just how strong the American economy was in his testimony to Congress, spurring fears the central bank may accelerate the rate of interest rate increases.
4104 2018-02-28 01:29:38 Nope... I think AR-15 should not be sold to 18 year olds. Bump-Stocks should be illegal.
4105 2018-02-28 01:28:56 HAha my cousin and I have been talking about stocks all day but like who the fuck am i?
4106 2018-02-28 01:28:54 YES, PUT PEOPLE IN THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE TRAINED IN THE USE OF WEAPONS AND HAVE THE BALLS TO RE ACT. LEAVE MY GUNS AND BUMP STOCKS ALONG. THIS IS A PEOPLE PROBLEM NOT A BUMP STOCK PROBLEM. THE FBI FAILED, THE COPS FAILED, THE SCHOOL PERSONNEL FAILED, HIS CARETAKERS FAILED, ETC.
4107 2018-02-28 01:28:45 Protests on the sides where we want gun reform, because our, sorry their, president isn’t working on that. Only the ban of bump stocks which is a start
4108 2018-02-28 01:28:26 @DerrickGaffney Why are stocks being stronger a bad this? Think of all those IRA's and 401K's.

4119 2018-02-28 01:21:15 Tried to think of a pun but got none 

Hes a good boy when he’s not trying to swindle me into real estate and stocks or my servants into becoming his wife harem I’m glad I finally fully ascended him 
4120 2018-02-28 01:20:34 They better because if they lose they're gonna be laughing stocks once again
4121 2018-02-28 01:20:27 And AR 15 and bump stocks still exists.
4122 2018-02-28 01:20:23 my medical marijuana stocks are up 133%
4123 2018-02-28 01:20:07 Next step: run company into ground, causing plummet in share prices. Buy back stocks you sold. Rinse. Repeat. When stockholders have had it, accept megabucks golden parachute to walk away.
4124 2018-02-28 01:18:36 Banning bump stocks is a no-brainer that should have been done shortly after Las Vegas. Ban large capacity (>10) magazines. California’s laws are a pretty good start.
4125 2018-02-28 01:18:08 2) The higher, historical returns in small and value stocks is because of differences in risk premium, rather than which firm is valuable or not. About mergers destroying value(which you said is in conflict with Porter), there may be other reasons like agency conflicts.
4126 2018-02-28 01:18:07 #Respect
@TommyThornton - the countdown to 'lower lows' has begun.

#JeffSaut - "textbook" bottom last week.

@NorthmanTrader - Rhymes w the '00 and '07 tops

@FZucchi -  Higher rates and higher stocks over time.

4128 2018-02-28 01:17:51 @SenSanders How come there is no discussion on the companies that make these weapons ? have not heard on word about Colt Firearms and the knock off companies that make the bump stocks and the over sized magazines.    Whats up ???????
4129 2018-02-28 01:15:48 Is this protesting all guns or AR rifles and bump stocks?
4130 2018-02-28 01:15:10 1) Thanks for the awesome episode. Just a quick thought about your view on Porter's 5 forces article. The 5 forces MAY tell us whether a particular factor creates value or not, but returns generated by stocks is compensation for the risks taken by the company.
4131 2018-02-28 01:14:57 I'm telling ya, the man is shorting stocks and that's why he needs the intel. Has anyone ever heard of him actually doing anything in his extensive portfolio? Its all a con.
4132 2018-02-28 01:13:23 I like to think I have smart kids, but the two things they were interested in in high school were girls and sports, not stocks!
4133 2018-02-28 01:12:42 Asian stocks are lower because of Fed’s concern about inflation. The big tax cut for corporations is expected to cause a 1970s style inflation. Flare pants will probably come back in style.
4134 2018-02-28 01:12:30 Just checked fedex stocks myself and yes they were down 2.27% today.
4135 2018-02-28 01:12:16 LOL. I'll be sure to take investment advice from a little child not even old enough to buy stocks!

4140 2018-02-28 01:11:05 Notice as well Sessions’ statement that DOJ doesn’t think Congress needs to act on bump stocks, taking that off table as well. Sessions knows this strategy will guarantee at least two years of delay

4142 2018-02-28 01:10:02 So very Proud of all of you .  Guns have no place in schools , and no place in the hands of people who are not mentally right . Also Military weapons or bump stocks .
4143 2018-02-28 01:09:33 Good start. Now ban military grade weapons, high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
4144 2018-02-28 01:09:03 "Buy sock stocks!"
4145 2018-02-28 01:07:38 Hang in there until November's election... G.O.P. is hoping this all blows over in a few weeks, like all the other mass murders.  How long has it been since the Vegas murders?   Can't even get bump stocks off the market.
4146 2018-02-28 01:07:20 Needs something thought it was there too and faded fast
4147 2018-02-28 01:06:44 Sorry ya i dont have
4148 2018-02-28 01:06:40 Nobody wants to take your damn guns away. Just common sense background checks, mentally unstable people not having guns, no need for assault weapons or bump stocks. People under 21 not being able to purchase a gun. They can't buy cigarettes and they can't buy booze
4149 2018-02-28 01:06:02 Yeah, stocks tend to move throughout the day. Doesn't mean that FedEx stock is collapsing.
4150 2018-02-28 01:05:50 Suddenly all the $mari pumpers have gone silent, and we know there were many. Guys (Peoplekind), avoid buying these up-and-coming stocks that get excessive mentions and pumping.
4151 2018-02-28 01:04:21 The NRA supports bans on bump stocks and automatic weapons, they also want to expand the NICS system  while at the same time protecting the right to defend yourself. Why is Bernie targeting rifles when handguns make up a huge majority of shootings?

4156 2018-02-28 01:01:36 Large institutional investors don't think in the short term like that unless they're players in the options market. They deal in Macroeconomic terms and forecasting models for stocks like FDX.
4157 2018-02-28 01:01:33 It was only penny stocks. Who even uses pennies anymore?

4159 2018-02-28 01:00:53 They won't, educate yourself and act, the fastest most effective thing to stop school shootings is to secure the schools, a total no brainer, bump stocks dumb, banning assault weapons dumb just like Clijnton telli by America, I did not have sexual relations with that woman
4160 2018-02-28 01:00:26 Y’all know they just use the liberal/socialist gun grabbing boogie man to generate guns sales. All the politicians stocks portfolios are making money!
4161 2018-02-28 01:00:14 Nobody wants to take your guns. Common sense controls. Comprehensive background checks with no loopholes. No bump stocks. No purchases under the age of 21.
4162 2018-02-28 00:59:35 No because I trade stocks and options :) crypto is just a part of what I do

4167 2018-02-28 00:57:29 There’s been more reporting on a large part of windfall to corporations going to stock buybacks, which overwhelmingly benefit the top 10% who own 84% of the stocks. A much smaller portion goes to average folks, and our tax breaks will expire. Meanwhile, democracy is under attack.
4168 2018-02-28 00:57:18 Man I wish I could have more talks bout stocks with dudes my age

4171 2018-02-28 00:56:01 @NRA my family Trump's your bump stocks!
4172 2018-02-28 00:55:52 Oh my goodness you are missing the point. It's not about SHUTTING down the NRA. It's about them not being flexible with what the MAJORITY of Americans want. No AR-15s available to the public no bump stocks making it harder to get guns. It's about compromise and they don't want to

4178 2018-02-28 00:52:52 With a bump stocks you can empty a 30 round magazine in three seconds. Without bump stocks it’ll take you seven seconds what good is Banning bump stocks. Ban the assault weapon.
4179 2018-02-28 00:51:42 Stock market traders love playing the volume, they can't make enough money on value stocks, so they manipulate. All the money guys I've been watching & listening to are all saying, the economy couldn't be stronger.

4180 2018-02-28 00:51:30 The best way to respect our kids is to ban assault weapons, bump stocks and quit kissing up to the NRA
4181 2018-02-28 00:50:57 Truth be told the rifles with the bump stocks were not the firearms that caused the most carnage.  From the few reports that have come out investigators found those firearms jammed (as is common) and he moved on to other firearms that did not have the bump stocks on them.
4182 2018-02-28 00:50:55 Yay for having money in the right stocks!
4183 2018-02-28 00:50:52 Do you still have stocks up to this date?
4184 2018-02-28 00:49:14 Powell was NOT hawkish! Anyone saying this is just making it up b/c stocks sold off.  After rallying 2100 points off recent lows and 400 points yesterday, Powell just didn't say Fed buying stocks! So yeah, stocks pulled back!

4186 2018-02-28 00:48:40 Are you saying that FedEx stocks increased at exactly the same rate as the average S&P increase? Wow! That’s amazing!
4187 2018-02-28 00:48:39 Of course. Unfortunately, the things that are going to be passed legislatively will likely do little to prevent future tragedies. If we raise the age, ban bump stocks, and throw in some additional background check related things, everyone will complacently stop the conversation.
4188 2018-02-28 00:48:37 Soros a god???  He is Satan.  Read about the 180+ organizations he funds. Why did he invest $42M in puts on MGM resort 90-days B4 massacre. That’s definitely not a common transaction. Plus MGM CEO sold 80% of his favorable stocks again 90-days B4. Your thoughts? #TheyKnew
4189 2018-02-28 00:48:34 Not to say either wouldn't have caused casualties, but I daresay neither would have been as effective as the AR 15. Automatics are illegal, so I can't even imagine why a mod like bump stocks would be. That seems like a no brainer.
4190 2018-02-28 00:48:20 You are good at sitting in the room, maybe you hear what is being said, but you have not said you will act on gun regulations, on bump stocks, large capacity mags, and assault rifles
4191 2018-02-28 00:47:24 commonwealth of mass has banned bump stocks
4192 2018-02-28 00:46:41 I think we start with banning all AR-15 type weapons, ban ownership for anyone convicted of any violent crime especially domestic violence, ban bump stocks, ban high capacity magazines, and require insurance coverage on each weapon payable at the time of purchase.
4193 2018-02-28 00:46:41 Don’t worry stocks dropping far enough & they will change their minds.
4194 2018-02-28 00:46:24 I just titled one of my papers “Stocks Are Down and I Think I Know Why” this is a cry for help
4195 2018-02-28 00:45:49 Just a reminder, bump stocks are as legal today as they were the day the Vegas shooter killed more than 50 people. The NRA made sure it stayed that way. #TerroristOrganization
4196 2018-02-28 00:45:37 people please learn market caps. just because one stock is worth more share price wise doesnt mean the company is worth more... man i get some people are new and thats fine but compare compare compare!! and market caps help you do that on a level playing field #stocks #trading

4200 2018-02-28 00:44:35 Does anyone know what the NRA's position on the matter if the DOJ bans bump stocks? Also, who will be suing the federal government over a bump stock ban? I want to follow the issue as closely as I can.
4201 2018-02-28 00:44:01 You see my good sir one day of stocks is rather a moot point no? You celebrate winning a battle when you are bring destroyed in the war. Bit humorous to watch. So by all means go nuts thinking this is a victory. Shows how small minded you all really are.

4204 2018-02-28 00:42:37 Now, I'm not completely uncompromising. I'd be okay with getting rid of bump stocks.  But it's NOT for you to say how many weapons I should or shouldn't have. Period.
4205 2018-02-28 00:42:13 @HardballChris so do you want to put a expert on guns on your show who isn’t a gun nut? Cause the governor of Washington you just had on said that bumper stocks turn semi’s into fully automatic weapons. Which they do not. Can we get a fair and honest expert please? Hell send me!
4206 2018-02-28 00:41:17 The history has some cases with stocks with similar symbols.
4207 2018-02-28 00:40:57 True. To further expound, not s single country worldwide arms it’s military with AR-15 or other semi-auto rifles. Not even with BUMP STOCKS! What idiots these subversives are! Try to take one from this law abider and learn which end is the business end FAST! The time approaches.

4209 2018-02-28 00:40:11 Like, he didn't mean what he said? Really? @POTUS @realdonaldtrump gun control 101: ban all assault weapons and bump stocks.  Keep it simple. Pass it now. #NoMoreShootings

4212 2018-02-28 00:39:54 Welcome to Normal Markets! As the Trump Economy, continues to Grow—Any talk of higher Rates—Will spur some Profit taking by Institutional Investors, But Yields are Still Very Low = Stocks will Continue to be Bought.  IMHO
4213 2018-02-28 00:39:11 #WallStreet #stocks have fallen sharply after #FederalReserve chair Jerome #Powell's comments on strengthening economy and inflation boosted bets the central bank would squeeze in a fourth rate hike this year.
4214 2018-02-28 00:39:01 Do you not understand what "the percentage of the population that owns stocks" means?
4215 2018-02-28 00:38:24 All tho I don’t do too much investing advice being buyside I do have Pinterest and cook the shit out of stuff. Much more rewarding than convincing people on food vs stocks. Lol.
4216 2018-02-28 00:38:09 That would appeal to young people. Do you want me to pretend that you don't speak publicly to young people? That you have your currency in that demographic, and you know the importance of honesty and consistency in rhetorical stocks is the measure of character and credability.

4218 2018-02-28 00:36:30 I need to find some marijuana stocks to invest in
4219 2018-02-28 00:36:26 Arming teachers in school is a terrible idea; its just political ju jitsu to get attention away from universal background checks, magazine limits, banning bump stocks, and actually doing research on gun violence as a public health issue. 

Let's keep our eyes on the ball folks.
4220 2018-02-28 00:35:34 But that is not what I said. What I said is that more than 50% of Americans own stocks and therefore profit from buybacks. I never contemplated the degree of profit. All that was in your head.
4221 2018-02-28 00:35:03 For my next birthday people should just gift me stocks 
4222 2018-02-28 00:34:12 No, that's what the media is telling you the reason is. Marijuana stocks are not CRASHING because marijuana legalization has been delayed a month. It's crashing because Institutions aren't defending the bid. Could they be maneuvering lower prices for next round of sector buyouts?
4223 2018-02-28 00:33:14 Money invested in stocks make money that is taxable, increasing tax revenues.
4224 2018-02-28 00:32:46 No I don't plan on shooting anyone im just a straight constitution person a Ar 15 is not a automatic rifle its only a automatic when you modify it like bump stocks
4225 2018-02-28 00:32:29 We aren’t we are trying to get rid of semi automatic and bump stocks and try to prevent school shootings which for some reason you seem to love them you dipshits 
4226 2018-02-28 00:32:07 I'll be handling sales myself and they'll be ready to sell some time around mid march/early april, stocks are limited so keep an eye out for a sales post o:

4228 2018-02-28 00:30:31 No one hates you for having a gun, that is not what these kids are saying.  We are talking about assault weapons, you don't need those to defend your family or for hunting!  Bump stocks need to be banned, raise the gun age and responsible background checks!
4229 2018-02-28 00:30:11 Its not about the NRA's right but their responsibility to sell their weapons of mass destruction more responsponsibly. Stop selling bump stocks for 1.
4230 2018-02-28 00:30:03 Bump stocks are still legal, so no, machine guns are not banned
4231 2018-02-28 00:29:52 LIAR - your 1.50 in the check tweet was true why did you delete. Companies, on the whole, are buying back their stocks. You know it. Stop lying to your followers Mr. What About. How’s this. #WhatAboutGunControl   The #2ndAmendment “is not unlimited” - Antonin Scalia
4232 2018-02-28 00:29:43 FWIW, I don't view flipping breakouts to be true swing trading. True swing trading is trading the swings that occur between a swing lo and a swing hi, for longs. #pullbacktrading #stocks

4235 2018-02-28 00:28:03 Considering that more than half of all American families own stocks I think it's fair to say that stock buybacks profit the average American.
4236 2018-02-28 00:27:15 This afternoon the legislature passed SB 5992 banning bump stocks in Washington state. I am proud and gratified to see bipartisan efforts succeed and #waleg lead on creating safer communities. There is much more to do, but this modest step is a meaningful start. #waleg
4237 2018-02-28 00:27:03 In new business, Grego speaks to the governor's plan to ban the sale of bump stocks. He says not to editorialize, but "as a middle school student would say, that's a no-brainer," he said.
4238 2018-02-28 00:26:52 ...if by "rising interest rates" you mean "weakening demand for treasuries" ... then yes, it kinda makes sense that stocks are going down.
4239 2018-02-28 00:26:34 Bump stocks are worthless anyway, ban them, I’m a gun enthusiast
4240 2018-02-28 00:26:05 He is right in line with the @NRA on this. Fully automatic weapons are still banned and we have background checks, though the #NRA wants faster better and more through background checks. Banning bump stocks would be in line with this also.

4243 2018-02-28 00:24:19 I cringe when i here all these people averaging down time and time again. Usually averaging down a very bad idea when it comes to penny stocks. I hope i am proven wrong for all those people that are emotionally making decisions.
4244 2018-02-28 00:23:42 I want what MOST NRA folks want (>80%): 1) Universal background checks 2) 48-hour waiting period 3) Ban on assault rifles and bump stocks. My DAD was military AND NRA. 22 yrs USMC. He said “No civilian should possess a weapon of war!” & he did SIX tours in Vietnam.
4245 2018-02-28 00:22:29 First, I don't own a gun, never have, no desire to.  Second, if you want to outlaw bump stocks, ban sales of semi-automatic rifles, fine. 2/
4246 2018-02-28 00:21:39 Stock buybacks increase the value of stocks. That profits the stock holders. That can be me, that can be you, that can be someone on wall Street. Also: you might wanna be a little more civil when claiming the moral high ground. God bless.
4247 2018-02-28 00:20:33 What makes you qualified to have an opinion about gun control?

A) Knowing the difference between a magazine and a clip, and bump stocks versus full automatic weapons.

B) Ability to assemble and disassemble handguns and rifles.

C) If I might get shot, I get to have an opinion.
4248 2018-02-28 00:20:24 They are called Mags and normal are 25 rounds or 100 round Beta-c drums (monkey nuts). I can for sure get behind banning bump stocks though. You need a class 3 permit to own fully auto. A bump stock is too close to that and people can lose control of their gun and it's dangerous.

Put all their savings into habanero stocks. Can't retire.
4252 2018-02-28 00:19:34 etrade is pretty good for penny stocks
4253 2018-02-28 00:17:42 I'm sure you hear this a lot, but I think you should invest in penny stocks to treat your cancer
4254 2018-02-28 00:17:34 Everyone can cause inflation in the stocks. You really do not want to be there, awful place for energy to be. It has no value really except over inflation.
4255 2018-02-28 00:16:38 Now that you robbed treasury for billionzires with your taxcuts,surprise,surprise republican controled states using court to kill healthcare.then of coarse robbing 401ks,after driving stocks artificially high to draw suckers in.typical GOP shakedown of the masses
4256 2018-02-28 00:16:37 Speaking of, how about an update into the number of bump stocks turned into to the Denver police. What is it now, week 2? None after week 1. How many law-abiding owners are complying with the law, or are there simply no bumps in Denver?
4257 2018-02-28 00:16:19 I haven't looked, but maybe a better comparison would be with what happened to the news stocks in those bear markets...?
4258 2018-02-28 00:15:49 The muscles of the forearm become fatigued with continuous pulling of the trigger finger and the rate of firing slows down. Bump stocks neatly solve that problem. We wouldn't want our mass killers to get tired would we?
4259 2018-02-28 00:15:49 Banning bump stocks will help prevent further gun violence? Ok how about a little more reading and a little less tweeting Governor?!
4260 2018-02-28 00:15:46 ban these types of weaponry/ bump stocks/ make sure age is 21/ back ground cks for all sales including
4261 2018-02-28 00:14:12 And it's not petty to recognize that income inequality is rampant in this country, it's the truth. 1% of the population owns 84% of stocks the numbers are indisputable
4262 2018-02-28 00:13:58 The 1917 is the easiest US rifle to authenticate. All parts are factory marked (W, R, or E). Stocks are marked  on the nose of the forend (trivia: Eddystone stocks were made at the Victrola phonograph plant). 1/2
4263 2018-02-28 00:13:32 I want to have congress vote on gun control. Ban assault weapons, bump stocks, clips over 10 bullets. No one should buy a gun if under 21. The next incident is on congress.
4264 2018-02-28 00:13:04 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
4265 2018-02-28 00:13:00 Good points but to be fair here: 1. Bonds lost a lot less than stocks. 2. Today, long term dollar devaluation is 'old news'; people accept some inflation and do not expect to hold currency as a _long term_ store of value. Also not sure if your graph includes interest; important.
4266 2018-02-28 00:12:39 Quality stocks to invest in?
4267 2018-02-28 00:12:08 "Give all the job creators as much money as possible so they create more jobs it's good for the economy" except that all that money isn't creating jobs it's being used to buy back stocks. It didn't work after Reagan's tax cuts or after Bush's tax cuts and it won't work now
4268 2018-02-28 00:12:04 As for background checks I agree with them. I also have my concealed carry. I don’t see a need for bump stocks, I want the laws that are currently in place to be utilized. So ain’t no crying here. I support our Constitution.
4269 2018-02-28 00:11:06 Great Mr President. I want gun control. That's banning assault weapons, bump stocks, over 10 shot magazine and gun purchases to under 21. Don't let the NRA dictate to you. Ignore them and quite taking their stinking money.
4270 2018-02-28 00:10:39 Now that republicans gutted treasury via billionaire taxcuts comes act 2 using republican controled states lawsuits to kill healthcare using gun control and kushner for smoke screen.act 3 will be raiding 401ks crashing stocks they built up to draw you in

4272 2018-02-28 00:10:10 Isn't it ILLEGAL to lie to Congress? Mr Powell, just did..for an hour. Too many to list but the biggest is easy to research. He stated the fed is reigning in the Fed balance sheet? (On Fed's own website)it's getting BIGGER. More free money for Banks/stocks. Less 4 avg citizen.
4273 2018-02-28 00:08:53 FedExs stocks have raised up over 300k I don't think your protest are working
4274 2018-02-28 00:07:09 Seems to me like some manipulation going on for most stocks so big guys can buy cheap shares, would I be on the right track?
4275 2018-02-28 00:06:11 U. S. Stocks Falls As New Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell downplays concerns over market volatility and says the central bank remains on course for more interest rate hikes.
4276 2018-02-28 00:05:11 I think you'd enjoy Bowser in Smash 4 if you picked him up: Up throw to neutral air a few times and then up throw to up air takes stocks off the top very consistently
4277 2018-02-28 00:05:08 couple good cannabis stocks in canada....
4278 2018-02-28 00:04:16 I’m not picking up fights with the kid. One person says FedEx stocks went up, its a lie. Go back and read my comments.
4279 2018-02-28 00:04:05 Whole market was down - which means 80% of the stocks would be down today.  Fed Reserve meeting & potential additional rate hikes.  Ugh day.  However, watch the stock over the next earnings cycle to see if impacted.  PappaJohns took 10 months of boycotting.
4280 2018-02-28 00:03:41 i hate #reddit.Its just people fighting about shit tat doesn't matter Prob will win word of the year at some point.That's when #AI has finally snuck into politicizing & monopolizing 4 its own control and gain.Creating wars 4 grow in certain stocks for certain gains #StonerThought
4281 2018-02-28 00:03:18 But you still won't do a thing about the availability of guns to the insane or kids. You won't ban assault weapons. You won't stop bump stocks or ammunition. YOU ARE USELESS!  #Tsunami2018 !

4284 2018-02-28 00:02:37 I know that how the market works. But that person says FedEx stocks went up, IT’s a lieeeeee. Do you even know the difference anymore.
4285 2018-02-28 00:02:28 @IcemanTrading Barry,  I keep getting dogged on individual stocks , feel like they never move up . $LL and $FIT were crushing today. Seems only the indices move up strongly
