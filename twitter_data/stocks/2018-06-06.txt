Next question..... So if I was to diversify my Superannuation into crypto and then do several trades or move gains  into gold or propery if the market seemed overheated are these taxable events? I feel like it's time to #smsf and diversify a chunk out of stocks.

50 2018-06-06 23:50:01 Bump stocks need to be restricted to military or police units. There is no need for the general population to have them.
51 2018-06-06 23:49:03 This should be a no brainer. Ban the bump stocks.
52 2018-06-06 23:48:08 Nintendos drop in stocks isnt due to their gaming decisions, more country related things. Happens in the US too. No need to worry guys, its what the market does.
53 2018-06-06 23:47:50 No bump stocks.

84 2018-06-06 23:40:24 Solar panels will crash in price (solar stocks r telling u already)  due to the supply glut CAUSED by govt subsidies but that doesn't make it cheaper to install/operate. In Cali, 45% of cost is design, permitting, connecting etc. Solar panels 25% if system costs.
85 2018-06-06 23:40:02 Yes, the minimum that Congress can do is ban bump stocks. Keep fighting.
86 2018-06-06 23:39:15 What flips are you eyeing? I sold a bunch of $WEED calls yesterday. Having a bit of regret but sitting on a good some of cash. I’m looking at cannabis stocks that haven’t moved much yet like $FIRE and $HVT

116 2018-06-06 23:31:28 China's unexpected move to slash incentives for solar power has sent stocks into a free fall and prompted analysts to lower forecasts for global installations this year amid expectations that a glut of excess panels would send prices tumbling.

121 2018-06-06 23:29:53 The way I play the game probably isn’t right but I buy then when they double I sell half. Move onto the next one like cybx in at .26. I hold over 60 stocks free trading. Ranging from 1k shares of weed to 150k shares of Mmj. 25 are mj plays. It’s kinda worked for me. I don’t short
122 2018-06-06 23:29:50 I made some statements like "tokenize stocks" and Coinbase & XRP. 
Few hours later, Coinbase:

"we can envision [...] tokenize existing types of securities, bringing to this space the benefits of cryptocurrency-based markets — like 24/7 trading, real-time settlement..."

Timing.
123 2018-06-06 23:29:45 He trades stocks? Most do... this is the first honest thing he’s said
124 2018-06-06 23:29:21 Been trading stocks its so boring here i just keep loading up on alts cos the charts look bottomed but 250bil crypto marketcap  could be around the corner 
125 2018-06-06 23:29:02 S&P 500 is up ~3% YTD or ~78 points. AMZN and MSFT are 50% of this move alone. Plus AAPL, NFLX, INTC, MA, NVDA and FB and these 8 stocks drive more than the rest of the market. #SPX #economics
126 2018-06-06 23:28:12 $VATE $SGDH both moving up on heavy volumes today. Tells me that the MJ stocks are heating up, especially, $SGDH. Its just a matter of time before this one makes a major move and a $POTN-like spike IMHO. Highly recommended to put this one on the watchlist going forward!

153 2018-06-06 23:20:05 Civilized countries do not have bump stocks freely available because they are not needed for target practice, protection or pest control. They are only needed for creating a large death toll.

164 2018-06-06 23:16:46 Agree. Ban bump stocks. It’s a tiny start but still important.

179 2018-06-06 23:13:21 Ban, ban, ban bump stocks and hurry up!
180 2018-06-06 23:13:19 No question bump stocks as well as all assault weapons need to be banned for sale. Large magazines as well

190 2018-06-06 23:11:03 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
Kids over NRA money.

You cannot believe anything Trump says.  The world is laughing.
191 2018-06-06 23:10:58 That said, I hold both of them in very high regard.  Senator Smith, however, I am not a fan of, to be blunt.  She has financial interest (stocks) in the medical industry, has floundered on Single Payer, supports #Polymet, and was a huge factor in the stadium deal.

193 2018-06-06 23:09:57 i've a few stocks like that
194 2018-06-06 23:09:52 There’s absolutely no reason for bump stocks to be sold. They serve no purpose except to make sure a gun is optimized for killing mass numbers of people.
195 2018-06-06 23:09:45 Cause bump stocks have only been used 1 time for a crime anywhere on the planet, and their use actually saved more people from being killed. A bump stock makes a gun less accurate but faster firing.
196 2018-06-06 23:09:43 There is no imaginable justification for the use of bump stocks.
197 2018-06-06 23:09:39 @timothysykes i wish some of the people still holding hmny would be willing to trust SEC fillings by management blatantly stating they may not be a going concern in a year. I apologize for being critical of you in the past. So many who trade high risk stocks need help.
198 2018-06-06 23:09:32 We need more cynical posters @swami2 Far too many investors treat this game like a boys club or cult and it doesn't matter if you're always right as long as you make people think. Good stocks eventually succeed regardless of social media just as others can fail.
199 2018-06-06 23:08:40 Of course Bump stocks should be banned!
200 2018-06-06 23:08:33 No more bump stocks !

235 2018-06-06 23:00:10 TIL: Advent purple is different than Lenten purple. Advent has more blue and Lent more red. Be sure your priests are dressed appropriately. This is not an actual requirement, more of a custom. But Gammarelli stocks both shades if you want to do some shopping.

311 2018-06-06 22:44:20 Why haven't you banned bump stocks or raised the age to purchase a firearm to 21 like you said you were going to do? Are you afraid of the NRA? #FailForceOne
312 2018-06-06 22:44:10 Make the comeback like two stocks with SoPo

318 2018-06-06 22:42:23 I am opposed to semi-automatic weapons like AR_15s. Bump stocks can turn an AR-15 into a fully automatic machine gun. Bump stocks must be banned!
319 2018-06-06 22:42:22 Ban bump stocks.
320 2018-06-06 22:42:21 Just bought my first couple of stocks. I hope they pay off 
321 2018-06-06 22:41:46 The very same @Bell_Potter that told us 3 months ago that $WTC was a SELL with a price target of about $10 !! Only up 60% since then. I guess its ok to be wrong as long as you dont stay wrong. Just out of interest...whats their stand on $WTC now ? #equities #stocks
322 2018-06-06 22:41:23 The reason is I mostly mention stocks I like  Despite the fact that my opinion should never be more than general research.... I'm mindful that some may consider that if I mention a stock it may be considered that I like the stock. It's all my opinion only but no blatant ramping.
323 2018-06-06 22:41:20 "What do you do?"
"I work in finance."
"Oh great! So I was thinking about buying these stocks. Are they a good buy? And what savings account gets me the best return. I have $22 in cash. Oh, and are you buying dinner?"
324 2018-06-06 22:40:51 Don’t listen to the haters. You guys are doing good work! Bump stocks need to be banned!

328 2018-06-06 22:39:53 For all of you who rode $AAGC congratulations but please take your profits. It's done with.
329 2018-06-06 22:39:45 Well, you haven't sold thru the worst these past couple of months, so you must know this is a good long term investment, unlike most other OTC stocks... so good job!
Selling now, when news is imminent, is plain idiotic, but it happens, lol.
Do you have other stocks or just BYOC?
330 2018-06-06 22:39:24 Short % on stocks I own

$NVDA 2.35% (very surprising)
$BABA 10.36%
$MU 5.92%
$TWTR 4.72%
$SQ 12.29%
$TSLA 31.03% (wonder how many they covered today. lol)
331 2018-06-06 22:39:23 Why not simply buy stocks? Again research first, find appropriate platform, reputable with low enough fees .. just like cryptocurrency. Except at the end you really do own a little piece of a corporation.
332 2018-06-06 22:39:13 BAN BUMP STOCKS!!
333 2018-06-06 22:39:03 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? 

Are you afraid of the @NRA?
334 2018-06-06 22:38:40 Civilians do not need bump stocks or AR’s. Doesn’t make sense. We need to grow compassion, not wealth of gun manufacturers.
335 2018-06-06 22:38:28 Hmmmm?
336 2018-06-06 22:37:18 But her getting to close our stocks put her at such a risk is DDD plays patiently and walls with spaced bairs n stuff.

346 2018-06-06 22:35:50 Yes, but not before early July. I'm approaching it by pre-deploying autumn OTM call options hedges past couple of months (when cheap) in preparation for going 300% net short in July. IWM, CAT, MS, NFLX. As stocks rally into strikes, I then short risk-free.

351 2018-06-06 22:34:24 Ban bump stocks. They serve no good purpose.
352 2018-06-06 22:34:04 I live in Las Vegas. First time I ever heard about Bump Stocks, and hopefully with this,  it'll be the last I hear of them.
353 2018-06-06 22:33:52 Bump stocks must be banned!
354 2018-06-06 22:33:50 Yes we need to ban bump stocks! #GunControlNow #GunReformNow
355 2018-06-06 22:33:49 100% agree with your recommendations, Housing finance sector will be outperform in next 5 years. However, out of the above 4 stocks my personal favourite is Tata motors Dvr.
356 2018-06-06 22:33:28 Ban bump stocks. Why would anyone want one, unless he's planning on killing a lot of people?  Idiocy
357 2018-06-06 22:33:24 How isn't that good for people? Really? Stronger Companies,  giving them the ability to expand and hire. Also stock sharing and 401K are fueled by it. It's a lot better then when you limited the buying of stocks to institutions like GMs. #StopResisting
358 2018-06-06 22:33:18 It’s time for gun control and the elimination of bump stocks!
359 2018-06-06 22:32:47 Ban bump stocks!!!!
360 2018-06-06 22:32:45 Stocks are the world’s great safe haven from overly promiscuous central banks... Worrying about inflation, that 5,000 year old scourge, seems way more sensible to us than fretting over when the next 5% pullback comes in the stock market.

361 2018-06-06 22:32:18 Ban tha bump stocks!! #BanBumpStocks
362 2018-06-06 22:32:16 Ban Bump Stocks
363 2018-06-06 22:32:15 That 3 mill dont count, you have 30,000,000 shares more. Keep your words! You So called Stock pro! Your group chat team pump garbage stocks like $AAGC
364 2018-06-06 22:32:15 you need to make the stocks work together, they just look like random stocks and they dont link with eachother or blend in, it oesnt look right
365 2018-06-06 22:32:14 There is no reason for bump stocks to exist except to make other guns automatics. Ban bump stocks!
366 2018-06-06 22:32:10 Ban bump stocks
367 2018-06-06 22:32:07 Sorry, it's not meaningful--yesterday was an over-reaction the opposite way--people chased tech/FANGs and ignored old economy stocks & sold financials. Today just a rotation the other way. I'm with you longer term, but market will melt-up another month or two first.
368 2018-06-06 22:31:47 Fuck bump stocks
369 2018-06-06 22:31:44 Dump the Bump stocks!!
370 2018-06-06 22:31:44 Ban bump stocks ffs
371 2018-06-06 22:31:30 bump stocks
372 2018-06-06 22:30:52 Good Lord! Ban bump stocks!
373 2018-06-06 22:30:50 America must ban Bump Stocks for the sake of our children
374 2018-06-06 22:30:46 We can ban bump stocks!
375 2018-06-06 22:30:44 Me: 
*gets hit by a bunch of Toon Link stuff and then up aired, dying at 140*
Man, I really feel like he just doesn't have to work for his stocks
10 seconds later:
*casually calls out a roll and half wafts it at 70*
Me: "Yeah, shut the hell up, Justin"
376 2018-06-06 22:30:40 While we’re on bump stocks, can someone please explain why the push to ban them. They were used once in a mass shooting.  A mass shooting where there are still no answers to what really went down and why.
377 2018-06-06 22:30:04 Stop@the madness. Stop making bump stocks.
378 2018-06-06 22:29:03 BAN BUMP STOCKS NOW!
379 2018-06-06 22:29:01 Ban bump stocks

381 2018-06-06 22:28:17 Ban bump stocks!!
382 2018-06-06 22:27:53 No reason for bump stocks or assault weapons period
383 2018-06-06 22:27:27 I mean, she's capable, but she also knows how to stop before killing you and just stocks some good sports drink in the kitchen so you can REFUEL (I'm not kidding, she really does that and I love her)
384 2018-06-06 22:27:27 Over stocks Nail Polishes..only $3.00
385 2018-06-06 22:27:20 What roll? Stocks are dead, taxes up, Sears and other retailers closing, what???
386 2018-06-06 22:26:47 Ban bump stocks!
387 2018-06-06 22:26:41 I bought options stocks yeah they are strong but for weekly is so hard
388 2018-06-06 22:26:37 Ban Bump Stocks!!!
389 2018-06-06 22:26:34 Can’t wait to say, “Ban bump stocks now!”
390 2018-06-06 22:26:33 There’s absolutely no good reason for the legality and accessibility of bump stocks
391 2018-06-06 22:26:30 I’m real dude! That’s my name. no picture cause phone not working right and I’m not wasting money on a new one. I’d rather buy stocks ! I now have to pay for illegals health care in California.
392 2018-06-06 22:26:07 I've never heard David endorse an outright ban on all firearms.  Do me a favor and wake the fuck up to that?  Just maybe you can't have it all Joe.  Maybe there's a line and you folks have crossed it.  Um, like endorsing the AR15?  Bump stocks? Hollow points?  Armor piercing?

396 2018-06-06 22:25:44 take them stocks down
397 2018-06-06 22:25:24 2 technology stocks slipped on Wednesday:
$YY -13.5%, $BVSN -12.9%
398 2018-06-06 22:24:49 Ban bump stocks!!!
399 2018-06-06 22:24:43 There is absolutely no reason for bump stocks! Weapons of mass destruction do not belong in the hands of civilians!
400 2018-06-06 22:24:41 There's absolutely no need for AR-15's or bump stocks unless one has criminal intent. Just because your idiot of a neighbour has one does not mean you need one. The NRA likes to say it's people who kill people, true, but if people did not have guns it would be a lot harder.
401 2018-06-06 22:24:38 Bump stocks need to be a thing of the past!  Ban them!
402 2018-06-06 22:24:19 $AETI like most stocks-news dependent-  chart is the tail wagged by the head. The contract factored in without new news could $1.00 or lower
403 2018-06-06 22:23:53 Neutral is fairly evenish but Zelda has a clear advantage in closing out stocks consistently, gordo is also super risky cuz if you read it you can upb into DDD
404 2018-06-06 22:23:45 Ban bump stocks, these needs to be taken out of this great country!
405 2018-06-06 22:23:31 Ban bump stocks!!
406 2018-06-06 22:23:24 Bam bumps stocks #BanBumpStocks
407 2018-06-06 22:23:09 Ban those bump stocks!
408 2018-06-06 22:22:44 There is zero need for anyone to have bump stocks.   Zero!  They need to be banned, now!
409 2018-06-06 22:22:22 Bump stocks should have been banned the day after the Vegas mass-shooting. The Trump admin doesn't care about saving lives. They love the NRA $ they receive more. Voter them out.
410 2018-06-06 22:22:15 Ban bump stocks and ban assault weapons. Period
411 2018-06-06 22:21:58 This is not what crypto is about. Invest in stocks, bonds and IRA is they want to be apart of that centralized controlled economy. I’m looking to bring an exchange to the world crypto needs, one for the people, where all the profits will be distributed to holders. #crypto #btc
412 2018-06-06 22:21:35 All weed stocks up for anticipation of the Senate tomrrow
413 2018-06-06 22:21:35 Ban bump stocks!
414 2018-06-06 22:21:19 We need fair trade. Things are not the same as they were in the 1980s.  We are $21 trillion in debt, pay the most for NATO and UN. The Marshall Plan was 50 years ago. Our baby boomers need help. Of course we are getting pushback. Stop worrying only about Wall Street stocks. Geez
415 2018-06-06 22:21:18 Ban bump stocks!!  For starters!!
416 2018-06-06 22:21:15 Ban bump stocks now. There's been enough death among our young people. Schools should be safe spaces. Enough is enough...
417 2018-06-06 22:21:07 Most middle class folks don't have pensions.

Around half of all Americans don't own stock.

92% of stock market is owned by top 20% of Americans.  Put another way, bottom 80% of Americans- including the middle class- share just 8% of stocks, so no, it's not "good for all"
418 2018-06-06 22:20:33 Trading stocks over the years has been no different, but this is one of those activities that actually required me to deliberately knock the obsession down a notch and back off some because it just got too intense.
419 2018-06-06 22:20:03 In the early stages putting everything back into inventory makes sense until you reach a sales plateau. That’s when I started investing in index funds and in individual stocks in companies I believe in.
420 2018-06-06 22:19:58 Twitter handle hasn’t changed. No other signs point to the change happening. Stocks are up on the brand. It’s a classic household name. It’s a marketing plan that’s working too gain attention and it’s working.
421 2018-06-06 22:19:53 Ban bump stocks now!
422 2018-06-06 22:19:41 Ban bump stocks! I'm tired of seeing these young people dying and those who have lost. We are better than this. Our kids need their schools to be safe spaces. Enough is enough.
423 2018-06-06 22:19:32 David for President! Ban fucking bump stocks!
424 2018-06-06 22:19:08 Ban bump stocks!
425 2018-06-06 22:19:07 Banning bump stocks should be a no brained. Do what’s right! #BanBumpStocks
426 2018-06-06 22:18:45 Bam bump stocks! Stay strong @davidhogg111 I’m sorry you are treated so badly and I’m so sorry for your loss and the trauma you endured.
427 2018-06-06 22:18:39 Of course bump stocks should be banned. Bump sticks, on the other hand, sound like a lot of fun!
428 2018-06-06 22:18:37 The CEOs and batons of industry (w their lackeys in Congress and WH) are the main culprits. They maximized profits by moving production to 3rd world countries, w the added benefit that kept our wages low so we could “compete” while they got astronomical bonuses & stocks rose
429 2018-06-06 22:18:34 Ban bump stocks
430 2018-06-06 22:18:06 Bump stocks should be banned

435 2018-06-06 22:17:04 Baby Steven I found your doc available on DVD at Amazon. It's temporary out of stock but I don't want miss it when they will receive new stocks because I DON'T WANT MISS A THING...Big kiss for you honey 
436 2018-06-06 22:16:53 Regretfully, I think this is an issue Dem politicians will lose if pushed on a Federal level. Rather let ea. state decide; if a “red” state wants to keep their gd guns &  bump stocks, so be it.
We need young adults - David, Emma, Cameron, Jaclyn, etc to keep push on Fed level.
437 2018-06-06 22:16:52 Ban bump stocks and assault weapons.
438 2018-06-06 22:16:44 No more bump stocks!
439 2018-06-06 22:16:44 What are you serious $WSTI looking good at 0024. In for a nice bounce. Very little time left before the Prs is released. 
  
 I'm  happy we are holding an going for much higher EPs. Thanks I don't  usually brings up's other stocks.  Could be a game changer.
440 2018-06-06 22:16:38 @AskRobinhood possible to separate holdings into unique portfolios or does everything have to be lumped under stocks vs watchlist?
441 2018-06-06 22:16:31 Ban bump stocks ! #NORA #NoDarkMoney   Get NRA out of politics. If you take their money , we will #VoteYouOut
442 2018-06-06 22:16:24 CT recently passed legislation banning bump stocks! Be like CT!
443 2018-06-06 22:16:04 Ban all bump stocks now!!!
444 2018-06-06 22:16:02 I am not short. I do not short stocks. Someone brought it to my attention and argued for its upside. I did hours of my own research and found out that the bearishness outweighs the bullishness and RTTR is likely going to be a zero. I wrote to warn investors of these odds.
445 2018-06-06 22:15:59 Ban bump stocks!

450 2018-06-06 22:13:39 Not suggesting stocks work like that, but for your trend picking these are clearly different.
451 2018-06-06 22:13:33 Already banned here in Massachusetts— ban bump stocks nationwide
452 2018-06-06 22:12:46 Thanks for your explanation honestly. I hate when people report on stocks but their facts aren’t very clear or complete
453 2018-06-06 22:12:23 @AUSiBiz where do you see junior mining stocks on ASX going in 2018?
454 2018-06-06 22:12:21 Ban bump stocks! And thank you, David! More people support you than don’t. Ignore haters. Ignorance breeds hate. 

#BanBumpStocks
455 2018-06-06 22:12:20 Definitely need to ban bump stocks. #enough
456 2018-06-06 22:12:13 didn’t he meet with the Parkland survivors and promise to up the gun purchase age to 21 and ban bump stocks, only to turn around like 2 days later and say nevermind? (this is all from memory so details could be wrong)
457 2018-06-06 22:12:10 Ban bump stocks
458 2018-06-06 22:11:59 i don't pretend to have expertise in small arms combat; if you do, that's impressive, glad you're alive. I am saying that NO civilian shd continue to be heavily armed on the streets or in schools or churches. don't u at least support stronger bg checks & banning bump stocks?
459 2018-06-06 22:11:38 Ban bump stocks now!
460 2018-06-06 22:11:33 Yes please ban bump stocks and all other automatic weapons and accessories that go with them.
461 2018-06-06 22:11:32 Looks like someone bought stocks in @Rihanna's shoulder glow makeup
462 2018-06-06 22:11:07 1. Ban assault weapons 
2. Ban bump stocks
3. Thorough Vetting
4. Throw the book at parents who made guns available to underage mass shooters
5. Increase penalties for illegally selling, transporting or distributing guns/ammo!
6. Protect the 2nd Amendment.
463 2018-06-06 22:10:48 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
464 2018-06-06 22:10:42 Yes, please ban bump stocks #BanBumpStocks
465 2018-06-06 22:10:40 Hey @FutureMoneyTren ... investing is a difficult thing. I get that. But some of us own your must own stocks @FirstMining and @GoldMiningInc , which have been decimated... think maybe we could get an update? Tx for all of us. Gold is still 1300, not 700!
466 2018-06-06 22:10:37 Bump Stocks allow mass slaughter in seconds. NO reason for any private citizen to own one. We saw the travesty of Las Vegas. #BanBumpStocks
467 2018-06-06 22:10:33 Either we ban bump stocks...or ban those politicians who support the NRA. We have the right to defend ourselves...but NOT at the price of our children!
468 2018-06-06 22:10:30 Understand, I have misgivings too. But the father & son sitting on a jetty are probably not a serious threat to fish stocks (unless there are 8 billion of them).
469 2018-06-06 22:10:27 $RFBC gets the CE Caveat Emptor
470 2018-06-06 22:10:27 From the 24 #stocks in finance sector that yesterday hit all-time highs, picked these:
$UFCS, $EFSC, $CME, $PFS, $TRU, $INDB, $TCF, $NDAQ, $HPP, $KMPR, $ICE, $CBSH, $IBOC, $EWBC
471 2018-06-06 22:10:24 So, when trump talks about tariffs, stocks fall. People sell. Then other people buy stock at these lower prices. Day or two later, trump backs off tariffs. Stocks go up. I wonder if his family buys the cheap stocks after he threatens tariffs. Then sells again when price is high?
472 2018-06-06 22:10:23 Too bad the great stock market profits still aren't making it into people's pockets. It is ending up in share holders and buying their own stocks.
473 2018-06-06 22:09:51 Why didn't you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
474 2018-06-06 22:09:39 Banning Bump Stocks and the Assault style Rifle's that fire High Velocity ammo that they are used on is just the beginning of Common Sense Reform. Background checks, placing abusers and anyone on Terrorist watch lists on No buy list would help too!
475 2018-06-06 22:09:34 Bump stocks should be banned! Save the people!
476 2018-06-06 22:09:31 Bump stocks can and must be banned!!!
477 2018-06-06 22:09:26 Bump stocks allow mass slaughter in mere seconds of time. We have seen them in action in Las Vegas. #BanBumpStocks
478 2018-06-06 22:09:14 Oh so now we’re talking about “pump” stocks?  I don’t know what those do, but I’m sorry an object almost killed you. 

And I assume you meant “take”? Haha! 

Sure, you can talk about it all you want. But we’re not going to undo our Constitution for a guy who can’t talk.
479 2018-06-06 22:08:57 Bump stocks are like trump stocks- totally useless and unnecessary
480 2018-06-06 22:08:50 Banning Bump Stocks is NOT banning guns. Do you know what they are or just bad reading comprehension?
481 2018-06-06 22:08:28 Can you recommend any Spanish stocks ? I’m hoping to visit Spain in January mainly to walk the Camino Portugues but also to look at houses. Compared with Australia, Spanish property is a value investor’s paradise.
482 2018-06-06 22:08:23 Ban bump stocks!
483 2018-06-06 22:08:00 Ban bump stocks!
484 2018-06-06 22:07:59 Throwback to when I took half a million stocks from the Zeldas in the Kirby vs Zelda crew battle so I was MVP of the Kirby discord for a while lol
485 2018-06-06 22:07:48 Ban bump stocks now! Thank you for your service!
486 2018-06-06 22:07:46 Bump stocks are not necessary for any rifle. This apparatus is for people with a fascination with just shooting stuff. No purpose at all. I see and hear this in my area. It’s really stupid.
487 2018-06-06 22:07:45 Ban bump stocks!!!
488 2018-06-06 22:07:37 Ban bump stocks!
489 2018-06-06 22:07:22 Ban bump stocks already. Its a no brainer.

491 2018-06-06 22:06:55 Ban bump stocks!
492 2018-06-06 22:06:49 Ban bump stocks!
493 2018-06-06 22:06:20 You have my support for restrictions of bump stocks
494 2018-06-06 22:06:17 Circuit City stocks them regularly
495 2018-06-06 22:06:13 crying at stocks outperforming Bitcoin,tours over boyo's
496 2018-06-06 22:05:48 Thanks for charing. I'm a novice when it comes to TA and stocks in general.
497 2018-06-06 22:05:43 In the end I never bought the stock so I have not followed closely ! Im not familiar with the ‘CICE’ abbreviation . As I don’t speak the language almost all of my French stocks were bought because they were statistically cheap. Sometimes not speaking can be an advantage!
498 2018-06-06 22:05:10 @TMFJMo just had a newborn son. Any ideas for stocks to buy for his future?
499 2018-06-06 22:04:55 Bump stocks bad.
500 2018-06-06 22:04:44 Let's first ban ervery single Republican out of Congress 
Here in California it's already a 3rd rated party. And then ban bump stocks and  pass a gun law.
501 2018-06-06 22:04:29 Ban Bump Stocks and protect Americans.
502 2018-06-06 22:04:22 Ban Bump Stocks.
503 2018-06-06 22:04:09 Bump stocks must be banned now!!
504 2018-06-06 22:04:01 Doesn't it usually drop before E3?
But whatever buy all stocks now so when they announce gandolf for Smash you'll be rolling on money!
505 2018-06-06 22:03:59 #BanBumpStocks  -  get rid of bump stocks, automatic weapons. Thank you David Hogg 
506 2018-06-06 22:03:05 I wanna buy stocks in all my favorite brands
507 2018-06-06 22:02:59 Massachusetts quickly passed a ban on bump stocks shortly after the Las Vegas massacre. We have some of the strictest gun laws in the country and the results show: we have the lowest gun homicide rate in the country. GUN CONTROL is the answer and it works!
508 2018-06-06 22:02:52 I will enjoy this week and sell on strength some stocks....building up liquidity until Friday morning...I agree on your comments, most of the investors will have to re-calculate their investments when the prices have fallen sharply as debt is hurting the economy. 
509 2018-06-06 22:02:24 People don’t seem to know that supermarkets don’t have stocks  anymore... Everything is “On demand” and big city’s like Londons population of 8,8 million could be very difficult to resupply... You need about 22000 tons of food a day (2,5 kg pp). Or about 880 lorries (25T).
510 2018-06-06 22:01:56 the valuation is literally mindblown, fundamentally one of the best stocks around
511 2018-06-06 22:01:54 After giving workers record bonuses, companies are buying back stocks for future raising of capital so that they won’t have to be bailed out by the likes of you, that’s business
512 2018-06-06 22:01:44 Stick with stocks.  Less stressful.
513 2018-06-06 22:01:38 Ban bump stocks
514 2018-06-06 22:01:24 Additionally, most investors stayed out of stocks for the entire 1982-1990 time period. Only got sucked in later in the 1990s but missed 10 years. Lots of fear and whatnot, even in the early 1990s when there was another recession.
515 2018-06-06 22:01:03 It’s time to BAN bump stocks & assault weapons. Our children’s lives depend on it.
516 2018-06-06 22:00:16 Please ban bump stocks!
517 2018-06-06 22:00:04 Bravo you young people from Parkland. Ban bump stocks is only the first of many needed changes. Reasonable gun laws. Gun owners: No, we are taking guns away. Jut making them safer and more reasonable.
518 2018-06-06 21:59:30 Ban bump stocks
519 2018-06-06 21:59:28 Ban bump stocks!
520 2018-06-06 21:59:11 Too many parents treat their kids like investments and get disappointed and angry if they don’t live up to lofty expectations. NEWS FLASH: We’re human beings, not stocks you can dump if we have a bad year.
521 2018-06-06 21:59:02 It's time we stopped allowing the gun killings of our children. Ban bump stocks to cut down on the slaughter but SEE the elephant in the room, which is GUNS!! Stop pandering to the NRA and advocating NRA propaganda! Fire the corrupt, incompetent Betsy DeVos!
522 2018-06-06 21:59:02 Yes we can!!!  Ban bump stocks now.
523 2018-06-06 21:58:56 I'm all in on the banning of bump stocks.
524 2018-06-06 21:58:53 What else am I looking at?
Buying AUDJPY on dips as before, as equity markets recover.
Buying AUDCHF and NZDCHF on dips = carry trades, abort when stocks collapse
GBP I am not touching: too uncertain a climate. COT positioning is very low in most currencies.
525 2018-06-06 21:58:44 Ban bump stocks and support the youth!
526 2018-06-06 21:58:42 Every day 93 Americans die from gun violence. Since Newtown there have been over 200 school shootings- one almost every week. Close loopholes in background checks/Promote gun safety/ BAN BUMP STOCKS
527 2018-06-06 21:58:32 Common sense says bump stocks are dangerous and need to go
528 2018-06-06 21:58:30 Go get them!!!  Ban bump stocks!!!
529 2018-06-06 21:58:03 Ban bump stocks!
530 2018-06-06 21:57:56 Ban bump stocks now!
531 2018-06-06 21:57:36 Bump-stocks clear purpose is to convert a rifle into a machine gun. Machine guns are already banned ... SOOOO .... If machine guns are banned, #BanBumpStocks.  This is not that difficult to comprehend.  Any lawmaker not on board values the NRA $ more than kids' lives.
532 2018-06-06 21:57:24 I hope everyone is playing stocks right now, the market is hot!
533 2018-06-06 21:56:59 Ban bump stocks and all weapons of war.  Regular citizens do not have the right to take away anyone’s right to Life Liberty & the Pursuit of Happiness
534 2018-06-06 21:56:35 But are they replacing mining stocks with other miners? Or are they trying to include other parts of the business chain?
535 2018-06-06 21:56:32 Ban Bump Stocks!
536 2018-06-06 21:56:13 Right! good to confirm. I was totally lost when I got to spec stocks. I had only been on NYSE prior but wanted to invest pot. What a lesson! haha. One thing I know, don't worry about the past and count lost dollars. Clear mind going forward with new lesson under the belt.
537 2018-06-06 21:56:12 Ban bump stocks, please. I vote.
538 2018-06-06 21:56:06 Been saying this for many years Worth at least 32$BILLION in US Stocks. The threat to their corporate $$ is real So need to keep US sick ,BTW. how  Many medical Cannabis Farms are invested in. By those Pharma Conglomerates..that the #LdsMOrg thReshold in... lol
539 2018-06-06 21:55:52 Shame about those bump stocks though.
540 2018-06-06 21:55:51 $PTI $AXON $EMIS $EOLS all those biotech stocks made me dizzy. No logic. Just trading.
541 2018-06-06 21:55:47 Banning Bump Stocks should be a no brainer but I guess the stupidity of this administration needs a heads up. #GunControlNow #NoNRA
542 2018-06-06 21:55:39 #Ban Bump Stocks
543 2018-06-06 21:55:38 Make communities safer - ban bump stocks!
544 2018-06-06 21:55:28 @SublimeTrades Hello John,
Just want to know how you prepare to obtain the good stocks in the morning ?
545 2018-06-06 21:55:27 Sessions has millions in private prison stocks etc.
546 2018-06-06 21:55:06 Stocks struggle to find a direction - Here's what you need to know...    #MarkusHeitkoetter #CoffeewithMarkus #RockwellTrading #Newsletter
547 2018-06-06 21:55:03 Ban Bump Stocks... Please
548 2018-06-06 21:54:38 Ban Bump Stocks
549 2018-06-06 21:54:36 Banning bump stocks would be at least a start,  but until guns are harder to get hold of there will always be more tragedies. Ban what you can now!
550 2018-06-06 21:54:34 No bump stocks! An absolutely unnecessary piece of equipment unless you're a terrible shot!
551 2018-06-06 21:54:14 @timseymour Hi Tim,, what are your thoughts on $MJ ETF ? Is it a good vehicle to play weed stocks. I already have a small position in Aurora and looking to diversify in this sector. Thanks...
552 2018-06-06 21:54:14 Ban bump stocks.
553 2018-06-06 21:54:06 Ban bump stocks! Automatic weapons are illegal for a reason
554 2018-06-06 21:54:01 Money back to people is minuscule compared to companies and they’re buying all their stocks back. 
-single payer is feasible it’s just people in this country are more worried about I than WE. The gun situation is a good example too 
-promise wasn’t kept prolly for good reason
555 2018-06-06 21:53:45 Ban bump stocks
556 2018-06-06 21:53:32 No bump stocks!!!!
557 2018-06-06 21:53:21 Trump told David Hogg he would ban bump stocks. Then he spoke at an NRA convention & told his audience that he would do nothing to thwart their efforts to protect the 2nd Amendment, which to the NRA means, help them sell more guns. We NEED gun reform. Start by banning bump stocks
558 2018-06-06 21:53:19 Yay! Stocks Up. Dow up 346 to 25,146, Nasdaq up 51 to 7689. My biggest holding, Twitter up to $40 share. Ok, thanks Uncle Don for tweets. All-time High for me
559 2018-06-06 21:53:13 Ban bump stocks!!!
560 2018-06-06 21:53:09 Ban bump stocks. At the very, very least.
561 2018-06-06 21:52:48 There is no need for bump stocks.  We need to stop the senseless violence!!!!
562 2018-06-06 21:52:38 Please point out where this says bump stocks, and AR-15s are okay. Pretty simple really. Also, in 1776 they had single shot rifles.
“A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”
563 2018-06-06 21:52:37 We must ban bump stocks - in addition to requiring background checks, eliminating gun show loop holes
564 2018-06-06 21:52:33 Did remember how Obama was afraid to go after the gun control. When do you think he bought the guns and the bump stocks? The depression was still in the works with the debt and lack of growth.
Glad you got released after your 8 years in solitary!
565 2018-06-06 21:52:30 ....but about bump stocks ?  Just Putin that out there ......
566 2018-06-06 21:52:27 Ban bump stocks

569 2018-06-06 21:51:55 No point to bump stocks except to kill more of what or whomever you're shooting at.
570 2018-06-06 21:51:51 This is common in the investment world- it’s technically not people selling, but rather people temporarily ceasing to buy stocks until they see what the future capital will look like after a reveal.

Happens in every industry.
571 2018-06-06 21:51:44 ....but what about bump stocks ?
572 2018-06-06 21:51:28 Agreed!  Ban bump stocks
573 2018-06-06 21:51:26 Ban bump stocks now !

575 2018-06-06 21:50:59 I stand with you and your brave peers who have taken on this challenge. As a owner myself, unless it is military use, there is NO NEED for bump stocks!! Ban them NOW!!
576 2018-06-06 21:50:55 I got 20 people free ...stocks
577 2018-06-06 21:50:51 Isn’t that why the “commission” was formed, after The Parkland School schootings? Part of trumps big talk on Gun Violence, when he talked about ban of bump stocks & & &, right “Talk”.
Talk isn’t saving lives, we need action!
We need out Government to act like they care! 
578 2018-06-06 21:50:30 Alejandro is a popobawa who trades stocks for a living.
579 2018-06-06 21:50:15 Market cap on those? All speculative,some might as well be penny stocks trading orc
580 2018-06-06 21:50:05 Ban bump stocks now!!
581 2018-06-06 21:49:59 Bump stocks, along with AR-15's, AK-47's should be banned.
582 2018-06-06 21:49:58 Please ban bump stocks
583 2018-06-06 21:49:42 Ban bump stocks!
584 2018-06-06 21:49:35 There is no reasonable use for automatic weapons and thus, for bump stocks.  Keep getting new intelligent voters who are not corrupted by Trump stupidity!
585 2018-06-06 21:49:32 Ban bump stocks nationwide!
586 2018-06-06 21:49:30 Ban bump stocks
587 2018-06-06 21:49:28 Didn't @realDonaldTrump say he would ban bump stocks? Oh, duh. Everything he says is a lie.
588 2018-06-06 21:49:18 Ban Bump Stocks!!!
589 2018-06-06 21:49:04 Ban Bump Stocks!
590 2018-06-06 21:48:58 I worked on a Spanish vessel outside Canadian waters fishing dwindling halibut stocks to sell to Japan, all subsidised by the EU. Madness.

602 2018-06-06 21:47:47 Ban  bump stocks!!
603 2018-06-06 21:47:44 Bought seveal MLP stocks such as ENB, BPL, EPD and ETP on this dip. The EIA report of consumption decreasing by 17 MM barrels/week not does not make any sense. EXport of crude is also going to zoom.
604 2018-06-06 21:47:44 We need to ban bump stocks.
605 2018-06-06 21:47:43 I think this makes sense both for CA and DNS replacements as well as other token trading systems like stocks but those systems are unlikely to change for economic reasons
606 2018-06-06 21:47:10 Bump stocks were designed to assist shooters with manual impairment.  That's how it passed muster with ATF. The manufacturer new exactly what he was marketing. An attachment that could kill hundreds.
607 2018-06-06 21:47:09 Banning bump stocks is a good down payment on the real work of more sane gun laws
608 2018-06-06 21:47:05 It's easy to make the simple comment "Ban bump stocks" and fill in your name and address. That's all it takes. 
Please take the couple of minutes to do this one important action.

615 2018-06-06 21:45:19 @RobinhoodApp is a good investing app for those looking to buy & sell stocks without a broker, & they currently don’t charge fees.
616 2018-06-06 21:45:16 the only politic's I want to see are photos of ren faires pickpockets locked up in the stocks with "ÞE COMMONE MANN" smeared in pigshit on a banner above them
617 2018-06-06 21:45:10 That depends on which stocks you buy. Many stocks have more than doubled in a relatively short period of time
618 2018-06-06 21:45:10 Ban bump stocks!
619 2018-06-06 21:45:03 No thanks! You nitwits have stepped on law abiding citizens for too long. Find the real culprit to blame not bump stocks or weapons. Smh...
620 2018-06-06 21:44:59 Bump Stocks ARE NOT protected by the 2nd Amendment!
621 2018-06-06 21:44:52 bingo. a constant money stream directly into indices. creates feedback loop. stocks stay high which in turn makes them more attractive to banks who issue lines of credit to companies can borrow and conduct buybacks which make other institutional money have to chase to meet index.
622 2018-06-06 21:44:51 I am in favor of banning bump stocks... #BanBumpStocks
623 2018-06-06 21:44:50 Ban bump stocks now
624 2018-06-06 21:44:38 Please ban bump stocks!!
625 2018-06-06 21:44:25 Done.  I said it was clear that bump stocks are used for hunting people, not animals, and everyone knows it.  It's time to ban them.
626 2018-06-06 21:43:42 Ban the Bump Stocks. Ridiculous that anyone needs this in a civilian context.
627 2018-06-06 21:43:39 I’m slowly ebaying stuff, but it takes so much time. hopefully it will pay off my credit card. Basically, I’m a small business owner who only stocks size 9 shoes and size 16/18 dress.
628 2018-06-06 21:43:35 Be a hero and ban bump stocks - you might save a life or two or three ... or hundreds or thousands.

636 2018-06-06 21:42:33 I don’t buy individual stocks, but if I did, this would get me to investigate buying Apple. If buys are at a low, the only surprises can come on the upside.
637 2018-06-06 21:42:28 Keep up the incredible job! Ban bump stocks since they are stupid, senseless & needless.
638 2018-06-06 21:42:21 Ban bump stocks!

694 2018-06-06 21:32:32 Banning Bump stocks is a no brainer. Keep up the fight for more logical controls. Thank you

702 2018-06-06 21:31:18 Well, with the War on Drugs they made the penalties very stiff! So maybe if they banned assault style weapons, bump stocks, extended magazines and made those penalties even stiffer than a felon getting caught with a gun, maybe that would work.... Just a thought
703 2018-06-06 21:31:17 If you are buying stocks up 15 you are most likely short them!

719 2018-06-06 21:28:04 Americans only vaguely grasp that the Stock Market has little to do with most people. When businesses lay off workers (reduce expenses) stocks soar and the rich make money. When stocks are low, they gobble them up, raising the value and the rich make money. It's all a game

The only thing that can stop this next bullrun is the ongoing tariff war . Stocks are overbought, yields are rising, and now the world bank is warning of another recession? It's not a matter of if, but when this will happen.

821 2018-06-06 21:09:16 #Wednesday Wisdom #stocks  Anybody who thinks this country is a winner because of imposed tariffs and protectionism has failed to read or learn from history. It's a clear road to the loss  of markets and financial instability. A crap shoot putting the nation's wealth at risk.

843 2018-06-06 21:05:29 Banning Bump stocks does not mean ban all guns... You're argument makes no sense and is irrelevant.
844 2018-06-06 21:05:24 Fully automatic rifles are heavily regulated & can cost 1000s of $$. Bump stocks retail for aprox $100 & 12 of them were in the Las Vegas hotel room. There's a reason for that - maximum death.  A person's "right" to fire very fast?  Uh Uh.  Ban them.

870 2018-06-06 21:02:07 Hey religious conservatives! Bump stocks aren’t in the bible! This means you don’t need them. You also don’t need semi or fully automatic weapons. If stones were good enough for us then, they’re good enough now. Take throwing lessons.

892 2018-06-06 21:00:05 Ha! Personally, I never try to time a stock. In fact (not that you asked) I don't even buy individual (public) stocks anymore – I've learned too many lessons the hard way.

(Complicating matters w/ TSLA is a fervent base of supporters, and we know that can impact logic.)

The president has failed to ban bump stocks as he said he would. Nor has he raised the age to purchase assault weapons that only belong on the battlefield.

926 2018-06-06 20:55:43 Bump stocks absolutely should be banned.  Thanks for leading the charge, David!
927 2018-06-06 20:55:35 Ban bump stocks!
928 2018-06-06 20:55:34 The very fact that bump stocks are even having to be discussed in the light of their ability to kill 50+ people in Las Vegas, is insane! The government is being run by the NRA. This must stop now.
929 2018-06-06 20:55:30 Why are bump stocks STILL available?
930 2018-06-06 20:55:08 Memory impaired much?  The 2017 Las Vegas massacre was a horrific demonstration of bump stocks! 58 dead and 800+ injured.  Coward County a new gun-nut meme for Broward County FL?  Nice!  We let teenagers buy much more powerful firearms than the sheriffs carry.
931 2018-06-06 20:54:41 ...band bump stocks NOW @NRA
932 2018-06-06 20:54:35 Them: “we should ban bump stocks” me: “we should provide much better mental health care” which opinion is more valid. Neither.
933 2018-06-06 20:54:25 No brainer! Ban bump stocks!
934 2018-06-06 20:54:04 Keep up the fantastic work, David!! I am so impressed at your dedicated efforts and motivating force to get bump stocks ban. You will succeed!!

941 2018-06-06 20:52:45 Bump stocks should be banned as should assault weapons.  I admire your perseverance and advocacy.

943 2018-06-06 20:52:11 Ban Bump Stocks!!!
944 2018-06-06 20:51:53 No citizens need bump stocks.
945 2018-06-06 20:51:28 We must ban bump stocks, & if you have a problem w that...get help.,
946 2018-06-06 20:51:21 Bump stocks need to be banned & we need comprehensive background checks to help protect all people. Registering is a first step but you actually have to vote during primaries and in November.
947 2018-06-06 20:51:01 Ban Bump stocks!
948 2018-06-06 20:50:40 Yes, bumps stocks should not be in the hands of individuals. Police departments think they should be banned. An overwhelming majority of Americans are in favor of common-sense gun laws. Only the NRA, the Gun industry, & the paranoid are opposed.
949 2018-06-06 20:50:31 All bump stocks should be removed, they promised that they would.
950 2018-06-06 20:50:31 No need for bump stocks

955 2018-06-06 20:49:38 Ban bump stocks now.
956 2018-06-06 20:49:23 1; they’re calling to ban bump stocks and weapons of war and to make the background checks better. 2: even if they WERE calling for a ”gun grab”, that is not bullying.
957 2018-06-06 20:49:14 Ban bump stocks please !
958 2018-06-06 20:49:12 Zero need for bump stocks. Taking some action to reduce deaths is critical. Doing nothing because it doesn’t fully eliminate tragedies, is nonsensical. Let’s start with bump stocks. Now!
959 2018-06-06 20:49:10 The Second Amendment doesn’t protect gun accessories like bump stocks. Ban them.
960 2018-06-06 20:49:00 TA is as good as an educated guess in this game. It might be right it might be wrong. The whole system was designed for the real markets where there is actual value in the stocks. Crypto is not the same 
961 2018-06-06 20:48:53 Ban bump stocks.   Why is this something we even have to say?
962 2018-06-06 20:48:47 Yes!!! Ban bump stocks. Background checks and waiting period!!! Make America safer

975 2018-06-06 20:47:05 Np bro my advice is do hella hella research! American stocks are going through a GREEN period so the faster you hop on the faster you make money. Also think long term too you can make money short term but it isn’t topical that’s why I chose good companies! Good luck!
976 2018-06-06 20:47:03 ban bump stocks. period. end of discussion.

989 2018-06-06 20:45:24 Banning bump stocks is one of many common sense gun reforms. Everybody is for it except the gun lobby. No one needs this modification. Please!
990 2018-06-06 20:45:23 You have to ask yourself are you more risky to get more rewards? (Me!) or are you safe which is less chance you’ll lose money but less reward. I also have these things called etfs which is a fund of a whole variety of stocks combined!
991 2018-06-06 20:45:11 Ban bump stocks!

1016 2018-06-06 20:42:18 Ban bump stocks. There is literally no need for them on a civilian level. Gun manufacturers don't care. This needs to stop.
1017 2018-06-06 20:42:14 Ban bump stocks now - no reason for anyone to have them.
1018 2018-06-06 20:42:06 Bump stocks are a cheat to get around a reasonable law. A cheap trick.

1023 2018-06-06 20:41:01 Ban bump stocks. Common sense.
1024 2018-06-06 20:41:00 He didn't ban guns nor assault rifles, the only thing he did was ban bump stocks. Great president, he never touched the 2A.
1025 2018-06-06 20:40:59 Ok so basically you can start with any amount of money even 500$ I personally use fidelity but you can use e trade or vanguard (just search trading stocks on google and you’ll see the platforms) I like Fidelity cause it’s 5$ per trade which is really cheap.
1026 2018-06-06 20:40:54 E.g. many shareholders are blind investors making decisions based on larger metrics like "are tech stocks doing well?". Also worth noting the myth that mngmt legally required to pursue profit regardless of moral judgement.

1029 2018-06-06 20:40:28 Bump stocks are unnecessary! #BanBumpStocks
1030 2018-06-06 20:40:14 Ban bump stocks. Vote out the gun lobby puppets in Congress.
1031 2018-06-06 20:40:12 Bump stocks serve no legitimate purpose: ban them ASAP.
1032 2018-06-06 20:40:07 My stocks up 2 % in an hour. I dig it
1033 2018-06-06 20:40:04 Ban bump stocks! #BanBumpStocks
1034 2018-06-06 20:40:01 50 on Chriss, 20 on Bender, 10 on Mudiay, 10 on Valentine, 10 on Portis.
Chriss and Valentine should be steady, long term growth stocks. The others more risk/reward.
1035 2018-06-06 20:40:01 Ban bump stocks already! Why do we need them?
1036 2018-06-06 20:39:57 @GiffordsCourage Thank you for your undaunted efforts to Ban Bump Stocks.
1037 2018-06-06 20:39:49 Rothschild's dumped 9,000 CEMEX Stocks preceding this. Coincidence?
1038 2018-06-06 20:39:46 Ban bump stocks
1039 2018-06-06 20:39:34 A lot of people should have their sentence commuted. but there are prison stocks, so people will continue to go to prison and serve lengthy sentences for nonsense.
1040 2018-06-06 20:39:28 Yes, ban bump stocks! Our society doesn’t need it!
1041 2018-06-06 20:39:02 Not only bump stocks assault rifles!!!
1042 2018-06-06 20:39:01 You can't equate stock market ups/downs directly to the economy. Were you pissed off at the economy when the stock market slid >10% six months ago? No. When you give corporations $1.5 trillion in tax breaks, they pay it out in buybacks and stocks go up. Jobs? not so much.
1043 2018-06-06 20:38:57 Ban bump stocks! 
1044 2018-06-06 20:38:52 Stocks hit levels I was shooting for and sold my first acquisitions for a nice little profit. Gonna take this liquidation and dive into another winner. Tomorrow is gonna be a big day! #YearOfTheFleet
1045 2018-06-06 20:38:46 Dow jumps 346 points, or 1.4%, and climbs above 25,000 as bank stocks soar. Nasdaq gains 0.7% to close at a record for the third day in a row. Bank of America rallies 3%. BU-83WE
1046 2018-06-06 20:38:41 Stocks to be banned? VOTE NOW!
 Have your thoughts on $20
Me: "cmon up
1047 2018-06-06 20:38:39 Just as overfishing knocked off 30% of Australia’s fish stocks in the last decade.
Poor Australia. When will her once Lucky County - & the US & UK- be free of @RupertMurdoch’s evil?
His @FoxNews lied USA into War of Aggression in Iraq. Nuremberg hung men for that.
Why is he free?
1048 2018-06-06 20:38:36 holding... maybe a dip maybe not.. I'm not out here trying to chase these stocks

1052 2018-06-06 20:37:28 寝れんけど昼ごろしんどくなってテスト爆死するやつやこれ
1053 2018-06-06 20:37:18 There is no acceptable rationale for allowing the sale of bump stocks or high-capacity magazines to turn rifles into semi-automatic weapons.  If we have learned nothing else after many mass shootings, it is that weapons that can kill multitudes quickly must be restricted.
1054 2018-06-06 20:37:05 We must ban bump stocks!!
1055 2018-06-06 20:37:00 Just curious, why do you talk about stocks the day they have already gone up 12-16% instead of the day before?
1056 2018-06-06 20:36:34 Ban Bump Stocks! What’s their purpose except to kill as many as you can in the shortest amount of time! Ban them! And David, you can’t reason with the willfully ignorant!
1057 2018-06-06 20:36:31 Ban bump stocks. Do. it.

1059 2018-06-06 20:36:14 Im shocked they r not already banned. Bump stocks are super ghetto n unsafe.
1060 2018-06-06 20:36:07 Bump stocks are not necessary to protect yourself. It's used to make a firearm a weapon of mass destruction
1061 2018-06-06 20:36:06 Ban bump stocks and register guns!
1062 2018-06-06 20:36:00 I'm guessing Cooley stocks!

1064 2018-06-06 20:35:41 There’s no place for bump stocks in America.
1065 2018-06-06 20:35:35 We need to boycott Bump Stocks.  There is no sane reason a citizen needs to own or use them.
1066 2018-06-06 20:35:31 Penny stocks are like parlaying. Good payouts but very risky.
1067 2018-06-06 20:35:15 #BanBumpStocks 
don't even know why i need to tweet the FACT that BUMP STOCKS KILL PEOPLE BY MAKING IT EASIER TO SHOOT EVERYTHING IN SIGHT - DO YOU NEED ANY OTHER REASON TO BAN THEM?
1068 2018-06-06 20:35:07 Bump stocks need to be banned now!!!

1072 2018-06-06 20:34:39 Other than the totally fabricated Las Vegas shooting, no one has ever been killed by a bump stock device.
No idea what actually happened in LV, but it was NOT some nut case with dozens of bump stocks shooting people.
That whole narrative was invented spur of the moment for cover.
1073 2018-06-06 20:34:38 Ban bump stocks and assault weapons
1074 2018-06-06 20:34:28 How is the first part not true. Less bullets would have been fired in the space of time. 

You said bump stocks aren’t an important issue right now. Why do you think that?
1075 2018-06-06 20:34:27 U allow ur work to be used as stocks?
1076 2018-06-06 20:34:16 Okay.  Then who really needs bump stocks?  I would think they helped Paddock lay down 1100 rounds in 10 mins.  Wouldn’t an old guy’s finger get tired without a bump stock?
1077 2018-06-06 20:34:12 I use Twitter everyday so I bought some of its stocks and basically paying myself to use social media 
1078 2018-06-06 20:34:12 Ban Bump stocks.

1085 2018-06-06 20:32:41 Worth watching NZ milk stocks today

There is an outbreak of disease there amongst cattle over 150k of them are to be culled

It is a devastating blow and distressing as well
1086 2018-06-06 20:32:30 Shout out to the best app out there @RobinhoodApp for giving everyone access to the markets #investment #stocks #OptionsTrading
1087 2018-06-06 20:32:29 Ban the Bump Stock.  Nowhere in real life except war is a Bump Stock needed.  Real Hunters from all over the world will agree.  Bump Stocks are in the hands of Goofballs, and need to be taken away...  ASAP

1102 2018-06-06 20:30:32 Can’t imagine why any sane person would be against banning bump stocks.
1103 2018-06-06 20:30:15 Just found out that my office stocks the freezer with various ice creams all summer long. This is both the best and worst news. 
1104 2018-06-06 20:30:05 $AAGC and many OTC stocks were down all day.  Guess what though..?  $AAGC recovered and closed even.  That just shows you how strong bulls are.  Stay tuned folks and watch how fortunes are made!
1105 2018-06-06 20:30:04 I'm a hunter. We don't need bump stocks. #BanBumpStocks
1106 2018-06-06 20:30:02 Banning bump stocks is just one of many changes that need to happen. #BanBumpStocks #EnoughIsEnough

1119 2018-06-06 20:28:48 I have more winning days than loss with stocks but the days I lose I lose big smh 
1120 2018-06-06 20:28:30 Strong demand all day.  The close was incredibly strong, but so was that bar from 9:40am-9:50am CST this morning.  After that the bears had no chance.  Fixed income could not get off the floor all day, which helped stocks too.
1121 2018-06-06 20:28:22 Bump stocks need to be banned!!!
1122 2018-06-06 20:28:19 Ban bump stocks!!!

1126 2018-06-06 20:27:54 “I think they’re gonna tank. My uncle says so and he does stocks sometimes”
1127 2018-06-06 20:27:21 How long you've been into trading? (Crypto,stocks,gummy bears... what ever)

1130 2018-06-06 20:27:07 (1/4) My elevator pitch for Pershing Square Holdings Ltd (PSH:AEX) back at the end of January was:

-Greatly discounted closed-end fund of mostly defensive US stocks and a manager who has outperformed in the past (I admit his record is patchy but good overall);
1131 2018-06-06 20:26:59 June should cap a decent first half of 2018 for US #stocks. There is exactly 1 #largecap sector working just now, #Tech, so the menu for #moneymanagers looking to play catch up on Q2 underperformance is short. The group is 25% of the S&P & will drag the market higher in its wake.
1132 2018-06-06 20:26:39 Ban Bump Stocks and David Hogg for Senate!

1136 2018-06-06 20:26:14 Clearly everybody knows that I absolutely  STOCKS... *but that said, - I‘m constantly hedging and preparing for a potential pullback or “fear” trade to come outta nowhere! Favorite protection products (besides individual puts) are: $GC_F, $JPY, $CHF, $VIX, $ZF_F, $ZN_F, $BTC.
1137 2018-06-06 20:26:09 You own stocks in Fox?
1138 2018-06-06 20:25:55 You entitled to your opinion, however it's not what gun sense activists are calling for. It is possible to believe and uphold the 2nd Amendment and also believe in common sense gun legislation such as Red Flag Laws, universal background checks, and banning bump stocks
1139 2018-06-06 20:25:47 Ok let’s ban bump stocks
1140 2018-06-06 20:25:46 You got It! BAN bump stocks.
1141 2018-06-06 20:25:46 Flint is a small part of the D+ infrastructure we have, not to mention that A. Stocks have been fluctuating like fucking crazy. B. Stocks only indicate how RICH people are doing. and C. Ever heard of the term “economic bubble”? How about “boom-and-bust”? That’s our economy right-
1142 2018-06-06 20:25:45 Couldn't be around for power hour probably would have taken a position in $CANN  for an overnight play.  Marijuana stocks moving today on anticipation of the senate passing the C-45.
1143 2018-06-06 20:25:38 How about honoring your promise to ban bump stocks??
1144 2018-06-06 20:25:28 "Dow soars, bank stocks soar.." How's your job, Forgotten Man? Do freezing kids in cages make up for it?

1158 2018-06-06 20:23:32 Mate, Lauren Stocks voted for the mandatory selection resolution. Not sure why you'd cynically use her speech as an example for your, evidently flawed, argument.
1159 2018-06-06 20:23:31 Ban bump stocks now!
1160 2018-06-06 20:23:19 World stocks ex Europe advance: US +.9%; Europe flat. Investors are hoping trade issues will be resolved in a positive way. Due to that, a failure to do so is not priced into markets. If failure occurs, it will catalyze a sharp downward move. A serious shorter-term risk.
1161 2018-06-06 20:23:15 Ban bump stocks. Not complicated.
1162 2018-06-06 20:23:06 Wall Street Instant Update; #Stocks celebrate Wednesday's return to the Dow 25,000 level with a 346 point gain closing at 25,146, the Nasdaq posting another record and up 51 points at 7689

1175 2018-06-06 20:21:25 I'm all for banning bump-stocks but not for raising the age to 21, unless we raise it for everything, joining the military and voting. Since according to you 18-20 yr old adults aren't mature enough to have a gun then they wouldn't be to fight or vote #RedWaveRising2018
1176 2018-06-06 20:21:18 Ban bump stocks!
1177 2018-06-06 20:21:08 Idk at what point to sell my stocks, but i think rn is good since I need the money good bye 3 years of stocks.
1178 2018-06-06 20:21:05 Should that bet or should I say bid be in Canadian penny stocks or dash something or other.   I feel like saying Stacy dash or maybe sandy a golden retriever 
1179 2018-06-06 20:21:01 We don't need weapons of war or bump stocks that can turn them into weapons of war AT ALL in everyday hands if you think their cool go serve our country! Unlike POTUS #BoneSpurs
1180 2018-06-06 20:21:00 the majority of women disagree with you, Joe. We're fighting to keep mass-murder weapons out of places where our kids and families can get shot. There is NO REASON for any civilian to carrymilitary-style rifles, bump stocks, or large-capacity magazines. #GunReformNow
1181 2018-06-06 20:20:59 This post please note: you might have seen a lot of stocks hit UC but BEPL did not. The reason is those stocks have a tailwind in the sector but BEPL Does not. However BEPL is expanding and THAT IS THE IMPORT SUBSTITUTION STORY. BEPL is long term. Just hold. Disc. 43 and Inv.

1199 2018-06-06 20:18:45 Backing up David Hogg to Ban bump stocks.   As a Veteran and an expert marksman I know full well the damage that automatic weapons can do.   To let them be reloaded that quickly by a civilian is ridiculous and unnecessary

1230 2018-06-06 20:14:57 Somebody please explain the necessity of bump stocks.  If you can't kill a deer without one, maybe you should buy your meat from a butcher.
1231 2018-06-06 20:14:56 I absolutely (don’t) want bump stocks! I use mine (that I don’t actually have) when I’m out hunting (never been)! Those rabbits are fast!!! I need my bump stock to even have a chance. Without one my trigger finger gets tired. Don’t tread on my God-given right to blast bunnies.

1243 2018-06-06 20:14:02 I served in the Army and trained w/ weapons capable of automatic fire — functionality that serves no practical purpose other than to kill multiple humans as fast as possible. Bump stocks enable this same functionality. Ban them now!

1248 2018-06-06 20:13:37 Absolutely we must. At the very least any @GOP member with a brain and a spine can see that bump stocks are for one thing and one thing only- killing humans.
1249 2018-06-06 20:13:34 Ban bump stocks
1250 2018-06-06 20:13:10 bump stocks, AND the rifles they are designed for, should be banned. Completely. Confiscate them.
1251 2018-06-06 20:13:07 People should also be careful of shorting stocks when those same companies are buying back shares.  Btw, blackout period starts next week I believe. Just saying.
1252 2018-06-06 20:13:06 @jimcramer  I do not fear a trade war.  What stocks would you buy now if were certain that Trump will come thru?
Thanks for what you do.  You have helped to make money and increase our quality of life!

1266 2018-06-06 20:11:26 I feel kinda bad for anyone who’s just sitting in #Bitcoin $BTC $XBT this year... not only has crypto been boring, it’s been a horrible trade that is tough to logically defend. Yes I own #Crypto & fake #Altcoins - but I didn’t give up on real investments like stocks, commodities.
1267 2018-06-06 20:11:26 The rise comes before the fall. Y’know, EXACTLY LIKE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. We can’t sustain this economic growth, so it’s just gonna collapse. Stocks have already taken a turn for the worse, layoffs are already on the table, and prices on gas especially are FAR higher. Try again.
1268 2018-06-06 20:11:11 Ban bump stocks. Civilians don’t need them!

1299 2018-06-06 20:08:05 This is what systemic risk means - ownership of stocks in the S&P 500 is concentrated within three companies. Vanguard, Black Rock and State Street. They represent about 88% of S&P 500.
1300 2018-06-06 20:08:00 It seems absurd to have to comment on bump stocks.

1308 2018-06-06 20:06:52 Bump stocks effectively turn an assault rifle into a machine gun.  Assault rifles are lethal enough as they come from the factory and should be banned. Bump stocks should ABSOLUTELY be banned

1381 2018-06-06 19:59:59 Ban bump stocks
1382 2018-06-06 19:59:55 I don’t have much comment on bump stocks. I cannot think of a mass shooting where a bump stock was used. Maybe Vegas? There’s too much controversy in that case. Imo bump stock or trigger finger doesn’t make much difference. And I don’t think banning them would make a difference
1383 2018-06-06 19:59:48 Ban bump stocks. What sportsmen use do they have. Oh, maybe blast that herd of buffalo.
1384 2018-06-06 19:59:47 Might as well ban pants, if you knew anything about bump-stocks you’d understand
1385 2018-06-06 19:59:44 Ban bump stocks!!!

1390 2018-06-06 19:59:26 Go buy a gun or try to buy a box of shells. They'll try to get you to buy 100's of rounds of ammo. The NRA is a terrorist organization. No one needs assault rifles or bump stocks.
1391 2018-06-06 19:59:17 Save a life, ban bump stocks.
1392 2018-06-06 19:59:17 Ban bum stocks.

1394 2018-06-06 19:59:11 Dear NRA fanatics - we don't want to take away your guns we just want to be sure you not insane before allowing you to be responsible for one.  And there is really no good reason for civilians to have bump stocks and assault/AR-15 semiautomatic weapons.
1395 2018-06-06 19:59:10 Ban the dang bump stocks already
1396 2018-06-06 19:59:05 Bump stocks are not for hunting. Ban them now.
1397 2018-06-06 19:59:03 I would like to hear the reasons for the need for assault rifles and bump stocks. Just one good reason.
1398 2018-06-06 19:58:57 And again, banning bump stocks is necessary and the right thing to do.
1399 2018-06-06 19:58:57 Wishing you the best in your continued efforts to ban bump stocks and other gun safety measures ! Stay strong

1422 2018-06-06 19:57:32 Let's all help these young people in their quest to ban bump stocks - some of their lives will depend upon it, especially if the government doesn't act to make schools safer.
1423 2018-06-06 19:57:13 Can I order online? I live in the Midlands and no one here stocks it. I have a friend with Devon connections who raves about your gin!
1424 2018-06-06 19:57:03 This is the blanket with eyes people talk of, needed in the cold. You need one? Get in touch, while stocks last
1425 2018-06-06 19:57:00 Am I right in assuming that even the hateful comments are actually ending up helping ban bump-stocks? Oh the bitter irony, and a genius move. Anyway, lets do this. Get rid of the bump stocks and negotiate common sense reform
1426 2018-06-06 19:56:58 Bump stocks need to be banned. There is no need for this type of accessory to be available to the public. It is not needed for hunting or 4 protection.
1427 2018-06-06 19:56:57 Ban bump stocks. Keep up the good work
1428 2018-06-06 19:56:51 Silly me, when Trump said they were banning bump stocks, I foolishly though he meant they were banning bump stocks.

1457 2018-06-06 19:55:17 I thought the Prez was going to ban bump stocks?  Wassup with that?
1458 2018-06-06 19:55:13 We CAN ban bump stocks.
1459 2018-06-06 19:55:12 Bump stocks just make already lethal assault weapons more lethal by increasing the weapons fire rate. Assault weapons must be restricted to the military, that’s who they were designed for and bump stocks outlawed.
1460 2018-06-06 19:55:08 Just read up on bump stocks. WHY ARE THESE STILL LEGAL? HOLY CRAP.

1470 2018-06-06 19:54:05 Bump stocks can't be made as you can use a stick and or finger as a bump stock. The one way to remove bump stocks is by removing recoil, you need to make rocket pistols common place. It would save lives as up close they are not deadly. They need time to accelerate.
1471 2018-06-06 19:54:04 Ban bump stocks now!
1472 2018-06-06 19:54:03 Melt the guns! and ban bump stocks in the meantime.

1485 2018-06-06 19:52:44 @jimcramer @MadMoneyOnCNBC Hey Jim, I hear you boast about $BA and talk about if you only could chose 2 stocks that you would chose $JNJ and $DIS, yet your Trust doesn't include $BA or $DIS.  Is this due to a particular discipline you employ to the Trust?
1486 2018-06-06 19:52:36 Ban the damn Bump Stocks. There is NO need for any civilian to have Bump Stocks OR an AR-15 rifle. #thatisall

1496 2018-06-06 19:51:49 My comment: Bump stocks don’t alter a semi-automatic firearm's internal mechanisms, and as such shouldn't be regulated under existing law and precedent.  .cc @KyleKashuv @DLoesch
1497 2018-06-06 19:51:45 Banning bump stocks is a smart, sane, logical first step to getting combat-grade assault weapons completely off American streets.

1502 2018-06-06 19:51:11 Yet Trump cut back funding to medical research. This bill will turn patients who are desperate for a cure into guinea pigs for Big Pharma. Trump's rich cronies will make tons of money off their pharmaceutical/medical stocks. Then they'll unleash the heroine from Afghanistan.

They make good trading stocks.

1582 2018-06-06 19:37:59 So play accordingly. The stocks move into them, money is made. By doing DD you can be the first to buy. Take NNRX for example, 0004s were just going now 001. 

Most wont put in the time to DD but someone will always pump them. It’s the market we choose to trade.

1591 2018-06-06 19:32:48 I missed the very beginning of the previous bull but seeing the stocks previously sluggish as the sector backdrop changes radically sure seems like a bear market dying. When that inflection point is reached these stocks and uranium itself will move fast.
1592 2018-06-06 19:31:53 Dow over 25,000. Stocks seemed to have resolved the sideways to the upside. TREND UP, NO HEDGES. Goin' with the flow and enjoying the ride.

1600 2018-06-06 19:29:27 Interesting proposals are out there to create a stabilizing “trader of last resort” for stocks (like old-time specialists). Query why municipal governments think their job is to set out extra punch bowls when the party gets crazy, but “make hay”, I guess.
1601 2018-06-06 19:29:16 I fail to see how this is an admission by anyone. Your proposal suggests raping our local seas, depleting what fish stocks we have been able to sustain. Yes money might be made. Then what? Yeah thought not. I suggest that you have a great deal to learn about journalism
1602 2018-06-06 19:28:27 I know nothing, but I will say the financials are by far my least favorite sector (in stocks) into year end. $FAZ options my favorite tool to play it... build positions on the dips, sell on the rips, repeat.
1603 2018-06-06 19:28:21 The only mutual fund I own is for my kids' RESP (it was easier to set up), otherwise just a few ETFs, a couple of bonds, a few income trust, stocks and rentals:) No exempt market funds.

1609 2018-06-06 19:25:06 Well Nintendo is traded OTC, so they’re not a part of normal exchanges, so their stocks I THINK are purchased differently, and OTC stocks are much more volatile, from what I understand. So when we talk about their stock, it’s not their NASDAQ or something that’s being considered

1635 2018-06-06 19:12:20 This year I gave most of my friends investment advice in stocks to invest only a handful of people took it. Most didn’t even reply. This advice was free, that unfortunately is how people miss out on opportunities

1637 2018-06-06 19:12:09 That is correct.  Thanks Max.  The idea is that many of those stocks drifted to an average rank of 37 by having lower returns than the index.

1646 2018-06-06 19:07:59 Diversification is roughly proportional to 1/sqrt(n of stocks).  Theoretically 10 or 100 is not that different. Losing 10% in a good year probably costs a pf manager job. Concentrating in oilers made good money for me last 2.5 yrs while maximum paper was over 30% early 2016.

I expect all 3 to close in the green today.
INTC looks like a bull flag to me.

1667 2018-06-06 18:55:45 Also found it interesting how many people said “I don’t invest in stocks just company 401k”.  Just highlights lack of knowledge on what 401k is or what mutual funds are.
1668 2018-06-06 18:55:39 Meyer: Cold storage stocks near normal levels. Cutout value will peak in the lower $80s and fall to mid $60s by Q4 2018. Hog prices on a national net price across all purchase methods basis will likely be high $50s to low $60s in Q4. #WPX18

1675 2018-06-06 18:51:22 Question: how does $LEAF deal change with the change in market cap of $ACB since the announced aquisition plans? Do LEAF shareholders get more, or less, ACB? I guess it depends on if the prices of the two stocks move parallel. If they do = no change in value.

1708 2018-06-06 18:37:03 To me it's more about access to guns than the guns themselves. I also want bump stocks and extended magazines banned. After that I'm not sure what the answer is. Luckily I'm not in charge of coming up with the solution because it's complicated

1795 2018-06-06 17:52:47 It's somewhat surprising, to me anyway, because fixed income is one of the areas where I see the most use for active management in the ETF space in terms of managing maturities, buying at discounts to par, etc. Plus, bonds are just way more confusing than stocks. ;)
1796 2018-06-06 17:52:36 Many of the scrips were trading at much much higher price as compared to its earnings & fundamentals.
This happens when the market is highly bullish & all of us forget fundamentals and continue investing in Excessively high PE ratio stocks (1/2)
1797 2018-06-06 17:51:44 You cherrypicked a commonly referred to timeframe from a list of commonly used timeframes.  You cherrypicked a stock and and a coin from a list of cult stocks and coins. Either acknowledge you’re a cherrypicker or you’re a non-rigorous thinker.  Simple.
1798 2018-06-06 17:51:40 You have to view Wall Street as the financial version of car salesmen. They're fundamentally stock salesmen (at least the "sell side" of Wall Street.) Their job is to sell stocks. Stocks are up? Get in on a hot market. Stocks are down? Buying opportunity.

1836 2018-06-06 17:34:40 Agreed... Just not partial to bashing stocks I'm not in I can do that easily...:-) but it's just not my thing.
1837 2018-06-06 17:34:09 Better safe than sorry!
1838 2018-06-06 17:34:07 I bought back the $yy position that I sold last week at 122 at 109 today.  I kept most of YY position as a long term hold. #stocks #investing For whatever reason YY most often plunges after earnings no matter how good they are (then it normally recovers quickly)

1841 2018-06-06 17:31:43 Hey there @JoseefSchachter, you missed the entire rally this year and the 100%+ gains in many oily stocks. Your call on oil has been brutal this year. Why would anyone subscribe to the the BS you pump out? Oh, that call for $50 by May, what happened to that brutal call?
1842 2018-06-06 17:31:29 I bought stocks in Twitter 2 years ago for $15 and sold them 6 months later at $18. I could have doubled my money today! Did I mention is was 10 stocks? Lol #twitterstock #StockMarket
1843 2018-06-06 17:31:11 Think about it. If the alpha male was to show any signs of weakness, that’s an invitation to be overthrown. When a person is overall good, the good is overlooked and the negatives stocks out the most.

1846 2018-06-06 17:29:15 There are some technical glitches in FIT . Holding stocks are not visible after 3 days. Why is it so ?? When are you rectifying it and normal operation can be done smoothly ??
1847 2018-06-06 17:29:02 I had stocks and spoke out anyhow. I owned Mettrum too. You are right, investors especially can be A class assholes. I don't fool myself about that anymore but I also know, many must have been afraid to speak or avoid confrontation. I am neither of those.

1849 2018-06-06 17:28:56 But the guy’s name is Stockman. He’s ought to know something about stocks, or two 
1850 2018-06-06 17:28:50 Whether it happens tomorrow or the day after, there are stocks out there like $THCX, $WEED, $TGOD, $VFF that are fairly prepped for a dump.

1853 2018-06-06 17:26:47 Some days its difficult to find like-minds. I was working at a legalizing clinic when it happened. Had to bite my tongue daily! I'd blog my frustration each night.  It makes you wonder which of those friends had stocks in said LPs?  Does capitalism make money trump friendship?

1856 2018-06-06 17:24:10 Time to call Congress and demand to be able

Why is Congress keeping you from getting rich

1857 2018-06-06 17:24:06 What about the cost of the tickets we are buying for a reduced service?
1858 2018-06-06 17:23:24 Mortgage Bonds are modestly higher as Stocks churn near unchanged. Floating brand new files with a 45+ day window until closing is prudent.

1861 2018-06-06 17:22:22 From where you bring such funny content for stocks traders ?
1862 2018-06-06 17:22:17 Well the big name stocks like $AMZN are fading.
1863 2018-06-06 17:22:12 I don’t want to play a character that’s either invalidated or 4 stocks everyone.

Used to be fun improving, but I’m so tired of being in limbo. I’ve been 1 set away at my last 4+ majors, all for the same type of thing.

And playing optimally sucks even more for everyone on-screen

1865 2018-06-06 17:20:42 I’m all in on $TSLA at the moment, in the past I’ve been in on $AMD, a bunch of different solar stocks, $BIDU, etc. $TSLA stock price is seriously depressed as meaningful Model 3 cash burn is over, P/E has been falling for years, and 34% sold short
1866 2018-06-06 17:19:16 Oh no.
No no: I'm pretty sure they're gonna wear and buy stocks of neckties.
The question is: on whose behalf they're gonna wear them?
1867 2018-06-06 17:18:02 Hmmm some of my favorite energy stocks up on the day.
1868 2018-06-06 17:16:57 Stepping away from crypto for awhile and dipping my toes into traditional stocks. So far I find them a lot more fun and less high speed (obviously). You can do more real time research, see financial reports, and still TA charts.

1875 2018-06-06 17:15:01 Current trade deficit at 7-month low. Mortgage Bonds looking sloppy heading into the afternoon as Stocks hit intraday highs. Dow +223 points
1876 2018-06-06 17:14:30 The wage levels were setup in 90s and if you think wage is the issue then step up it to 110k or above and see. Moreover From same corporation you want better returns when you invest on stocks.
1877 2018-06-06 17:14:25 The battle at US$60/b should start soon and once below this price, we should see oil stocks fall sharply. If so, we should start to add more ideas to our Action Alert BUY list.

Many people claimed (and I believed) Small/Mid Caps stared to do well post  NDA forming govt in 2014 (Modi factor). I was wondering how so many stocks became multbgrs in no time bcs of govt. Now I got it

1881 2018-06-06 17:12:42 Thank you sir will follow your valuable suggestions..Yes true that recent mid/smallcap carnage has made many stocks available at dreamed prices picking pocketing some on daily basis in small qty as no one can guess the bottom.
1882 2018-06-06 17:12:34 I feel like this is market manipulation to get the stocks cheaper so if Nintendo's E3 is good then the stocks will go way up making people money. That, or the show will be trash. Time will tell, LOL
1883 2018-06-06 17:11:39 Corrupt Wall Street...what are you invested in? Stocks? Or are you to young to have a retirement? I bet Bernie's invested in Wall Street, it's probably why he won't release his taxes. Wouldn't want to look like a corporate schill.

1897 2018-06-06 17:05:43 Stock is a very long game, that lost people play short term which affects the entire market. 

If I were Gates or Buffet much different as I could buy tons of stocks and not be affected by changes. 

Ok to share.
1898 2018-06-06 17:05:42 One day before the Senate must vote and finally starting to see a rally! In my experience stocks tend to go up on rumor and down on facts- hence there could be a bounce down after the vote.
1899 2018-06-06 17:05:19 Stocks going up
1900 2018-06-06 17:04:08 Hey @tlrailuk instead of telling us about all these “operational incidents”, just own it and tell us you don’t have enough drivers. People will still be mad but right now they’re mad about 2 things: their trains are cancelled AND you’re not being open about it. Instant 50% gain!

1908 2018-06-06 16:58:33 Damn bots, these Dems are getting desperate. We don’t need to ban Bump-stocks or raise the age limit. Then why not raise the age limit to vote? Oh that’s right cause it’s unconstitutional. You can’t limit citizens to buying firearms, cause you don’t like what’s happening.
1909 2018-06-06 16:58:21 Hi Tweeps! Stocks solid again today, nothing much further to say there!  Still scrambling to get everything done before going to Singapore and then Russia next week!

1913 2018-06-06 16:56:53 Do you hold Trump to the same "Stinking words" standard?

You know, like when he said he would declare an opioid emergency, but didn't...

...or when he said Bump Stocks were "gone"... and then changed his position...

...or release his tax returns...
1914 2018-06-06 16:56:21 Yep. Corporations are buying back their stocks, not spending it on workers like the GOP said they would. The rich get richer and the poor stay poor. #GOPTaxScam

1932 2018-06-06 16:49:00 Ban Bump Stocks & AR-15s !
1933 2018-06-06 16:48:49 Especially if the stock gets wet, which makes it heavier. Also, wet stocks will warp, throwing off the accuracy, and also weaken the stock. You don't want to break a stock in combat.
1934 2018-06-06 16:48:46 CNBC is a retail advisor worst enemy who believes in risk management or other asset categories outside of U.S. stocks.
1935 2018-06-06 16:48:36 The thing that you must make sure is that you fish in a lake where BIG fishes swims … Means: Have criteria for #stocks where sometimes a really BIG "fish" appears. That's the game of odds and a great enough sample size.
1936 2018-06-06 16:48:29 No difference! The only thing that changes are the names of the stocks and the names of the players.
1937 2018-06-06 16:48:21 PORTFOLIO up 0.5% today - not too bad I guess especially as I can hardly claim to have been 'working' hard on my Stocks  ;-))))
1938 2018-06-06 16:47:55 I would but I don’t know shit about stocks yet.
1939 2018-06-06 16:47:48 I know the problem is larger than that. Our society is rotting. Too many mentally ill or disaffected men with hate. Controlling weapons that kill fast in a short time mitigates the killings. No one needs high capacity magazines, bump stocks, or carbines that can be automated
1940 2018-06-06 16:47:38 IMHO best #uranium #stocks to own are those having world-class high-grade #U3O8 assets with strong M&A takeout premium potential, highly-leveraged to rising #U3O8 prices  Fission $FCU & Denison $DML fit that model. I prefer Exp/Dev over producers in Bull Market. JMO Cheers!
1941 2018-06-06 16:47:22 Nice video Paddy and it totally make sense. I traded also penny stocks before the crypto and noticed the same thing with trading Mooncoin: you can buy some crypto under 1 sat and one day it may be several sats. That's cool.
1942 2018-06-06 16:47:19 Ppl bought these stocks wid so much of leverage , thinking of being left out at every sudden rise & upper circuit ..reason for sudden fall... Graphite, heg , rain .
1943 2018-06-06 16:47:17 US STOCKS-Dow heads higher, tech stocks mixed after surge - Reuters
1944 2018-06-06 16:47:13 Sounds about right to me. Stocks & Voice Memos were project that were fine to fail or delay be a year. Home and News would be acceptable, too. The App Store was a "must deliver" - not creating unnecessary dependencies takes pressure off both teams.
1945 2018-06-06 16:46:59 Absolutely useless she is. Ye should have asked her what she's doin about the collapse of wild Salmon and Sea Trout stocks in relation tae fish farming. I've asked her at least 20 times and still waiting on an answer.. Needs tae resign. Saor Alba..
1946 2018-06-06 16:46:48 So basically, if you bought stocks around 1950 and HODLd until the mid-70s, you made 0% gains.
1947 2018-06-06 16:46:05 I made the #experience that it more pays off to act like a "portfolio manager" managing a trading system then be focused on single #stocks. But this is just my thinking … It could be different than yours.
1948 2018-06-06 16:45:03 Sad state of affairs when officials"think" they can cover "it" all up.  I was against jail time, but the more this goes on I'm changing my mind.  M.Stewart went to jail for lesser crime.  Let's begin a comparison from stocks to constitutional law.
1949 2018-06-06 16:43:49 1982-2000 must be the most LOVED bull market ever. Those decades were an endless hairspray and coke party where nothing could ever go wrong. In this bull market, people have been waiting for it to end even before it started. No matter where stocks go, everyone’s just worrying.

- Projections to identify emerging #fisheries or shared stocks
1951 2018-06-06 16:42:47 Most of the savings that were supposed to go to wage increases were used to buy back stocks.  This is one reason the stock market, in which many people have no investment, is doing good.  Corporations are not emotional entities; their only purpose is to make profits.
1952 2018-06-06 16:42:41 The #trading process must be simple:
1. Scan for #stocks which meets your criteria.
2. Put them on a WL.
3. Select all stocks which are near the buying point and put them on a separate WL.
4. Look at these stocks every day.
5. If one makes a new 52w high -> Buy!
1953 2018-06-06 16:42:14 Many cite the abundance of bears on Twitter as a bullish case for stocks. But most bears I know, are more or less permabears. Who was steadfastly bullish till the end of 2017 and then turned decisively bearish in 2018?

1955 2018-06-06 16:41:14 The "breakout derby" continues today, with lots of leading stocks on the move, Boeing $BA taking top honors with a $9.55/share move so far today. The FAANG stocks not doing so well, perhaps due to recent Facebook $FB data sharing revelations.
1956 2018-06-06 16:40:46 What app do you use to buy your stocks?
1957 2018-06-06 16:40:38 If you don't understand how banning bump stocks could reduce the impact of a mass shooting, I'm not sure we can keep conversing. And I would really not have to live in a world where every single location where people congregate needs security and metal detectors.

1968 2018-06-06 16:35:58 I'm lazy so i didn't read the pdf link u used, but here's a suggestion u can check out. 

Take stocks from 2008 January peak, remove ones <1000cr mkt cap in 2008, then keep only those with CAGR growth of stock prices more than 26%. It could bring some interesting results!

1977 2018-06-06 16:31:17 Bottom line: stocks are long game, and this is a bit sudden but with since a constant year-to-year, bulls probably aren’t too worried about this correction. I’d wager you’d see a buy surge at some point this month too.

1986 2018-06-06 16:28:12 @RobinhoodApp @AskRobinhood an app suggestion. Different stocks should be shareable.

2182 2018-06-06 15:17:13 Treasury supply is also a factor in yields. Too much supply can push yields higher (w/ growth and inflation also a factor). And higher T yields not only increase borrowing costs for everyone (most lending benchmarked to T's) but can hurt stocks as well.

2213 2018-06-06 15:04:59 Sometimes it will happen organically if you keep feeding your winners and cutting your laggards. I've found that better for me than trying to only focus on a few names. Let the best stocks choose you instead of the other way around.

2222 2018-06-06 15:01:13 So obvious that (at minimum) BOJ holding/ramping stock markets as USD/JPY rises and most influential stocks ramp on no news!
2223 2018-06-06 14:59:58 Part of my frustration is that my "Value stock" funds have underperformed. Which is on me. So I think it's higher risk for people to be jumping in now. Plus if there is a protracted down market, I think stock pickers of individual stocks will come out ahead.

2229 2018-06-06 14:58:20 The real problem with $axon is it reinforces that you can own crap bio stocks and one day see 100% gain. It makes you think you're "winning" when the whole strategy is as ludicrous as their actual pipeline.

2233 2018-06-06 14:57:00 With that I agree. I think our timeframes might be different. Even the strongest stocks fundamentally will struggle to make headway if the group as a whole is under pressure. I believe that's all we're seeing.
2234 2018-06-06 14:56:53 Honestly, if cryptocurrencies are successful from a technical standpoint the major players will just abandon the market and make their own (FedCoin? Face-bank? The Rothschild?), thus largely collapsing the market. Honesty like penny stocks of old, big $ will avoid.

2238 2018-06-06 14:55:55 IS this ease of doing business? Even if these are regulations imposed by SEBI to protect small investors then how come brokers are running away with the money of their clients and all the stocks in the ASM list is showing so much volatality which does not happen in usual course.

2263 2018-06-06 14:47:17 I think you forgot about Obama lifting the ban on bump stocks. Banning gun parts and restricting firearms purchases to age 21+ violates our 2nd Amendment. It is an infringement on the right to bear arms.

2337 2018-06-06 14:28:00 $SRAX trimming here my position on today's relative strength. One of the worst stocks I've ever bought in my trading career and that's saying something. Horrible company; loads of bells and whistles and shiny stuff on twitter and that's it.
2338 2018-06-06 14:27:34 I’m wondering why Indian stocks are falling?
2339 2018-06-06 14:27:20 PENNY STOCKS MOMO ALERT: $MYHI - MOUNTAIN HIGH ACQUISITION
2340 2018-06-06 14:27:16 What explains wide divergence of performance among multi factor #ETFs seemingly using same factors? Proposed to be asked at @InsideETFs #insidesmartbeta. It’s the holdings. $jpus owns different stocks than $gslc $clrg.
2341 2018-06-06 14:26:01 Taxes are down?  You wait for that check, lady.  Unless you are already rich, you will get peanuts back.  That tax cut was for corporations and they’re busy buying back their stocks, not investing in the US.  #MAGAconned
2342 2018-06-06 14:25:47 People who know how stocks work:
My stock lost value, yet paid a dividend. How does that work? #Confused #EducateMe
2343 2018-06-06 14:25:24 As of yesterday I got 2000 shares of common stocks but sold for the loss and converted to 6000 shares of Option Call.  Cost me $24k for those option.  If the stock did not move up to $70 by the end of the year, I will lost that amount.  That is the risk that I am willing to spend

2345 2018-06-06 14:24:40 Even in India stocks have Rallied with hikes though 
2346 2018-06-06 14:24:38 The gentleman that stocks the cafe at work gave me a sundae cone at 9 a.m. this morning. After consuming it, I'm gonna have to go ahead and recommend that everyone incorporate a 9 a.m. sundae cone into your daily routine.
2347 2018-06-06 14:23:42 Reason being int rates inspite of hikes is still 1.5-1.75% range where as stocks give easily 8-10%. In Indian context if the int rate is hiked by 200 bps, your bank FDs will give 9%. why then invest in stocks?

2350 2018-06-06 14:22:51 They say being a security it will not have enough liquidity but i think that is false. On the Nasdaq divident stocks only pay out 4/6%, once Nasdaq starts trading crypto (CEO said they have interest) imagine what security tokens will do on that market. $NEX
2351 2018-06-06 14:22:33 I pity the guys who give recco,when stocks fall they are held responsible & daily q are asked. 

Even I have bough penny stocks ramavision, megacorp,sucrosa etc based on recco,my bet on them very less n all down so i should go n fight. Chill guys,they are for plays.

2353 2018-06-06 14:22:13 @TMFUltraLong you need to stop writing articles on cannibas stocks for The Motley Fool.  You’re not even close on future predictions. In fact, you are flat out wrong. Don’t feel bad, not one article written so far that I’ve read by other authors has an accurate depiction either.

2365 2018-06-06 14:15:49 Yesterday I learned about the Robinhood stock trading app which allows you to make no-fee stock trades. You can buy a single share of stock, and it doesn't cost anything. Easy way to play around with penny stocks.

When are we going to learn that stocks and big banks are the source of all our problems. If would only take the US middle class to a higher level!
2368 2018-06-06 14:14:47 Utilities are the big loser so far today as the 10-yr #bond yield pushes back towards 3% ahead of the #Fed meeting next week. That move seems to have stalled out the rally in #stocks. Utes down 1.5% in a flat market.

2373 2018-06-06 14:13:27 It's not one of my holdings, just a move I reported on, as that big of a jump is significant in the sector. I don't love penny stocks period, to be honest.
2374 2018-06-06 14:13:11 Though, I guess all the stocks could be “held” and still have fewer people following a particular strategy.  They just hold for other reasons.

Ignore me.  I got off a red eye this morning and am really tired.

2457 2018-06-06 13:49:36 Earnings this season seem to be reason to sell regardless of info. Leaning in the 75% range gapping down. (Based on stocks with weekly options)
2458 2018-06-06 13:49:32 What kind of question is that? We should all be afraid of bump stocks since that's what helped the Las Vegas shooter kill 58 people and injure at least 489 more. We all know he could not have done that much harm without the bump stock.

2485 2018-06-06 13:39:42 At this point Facebook and Apple are too big too fail. If Zuckerberg or Tim Cook go on the street and murder somebody in plain sight, investors will circle the wagons and bid up the stocks. It will be a reason to buy the stock.

2491 2018-06-06 13:38:16 Jim Chanos certainly thinks so. I'm sure 9 years of equity markets gains encouraged more risk-taking  leading to investors piling into pump and dump weed stocks and shitcoins. But I would argue this only exacerbated the ridiculous rally of 2017 rather than being the main driver.

2497 2018-06-06 13:35:15 Did you even take Civics? The Congress is the one that makes the laws not the President. He did ban Bump Stocks...
2498 2018-06-06 13:35:02 Got your campaign letter.   Send your kids down my street so I can tell them how daddy takes away school lunches from other kids, and is indifferent to school safety, given his support of high-capacity magazines and bump stocks
2499 2018-06-06 13:34:41 I have a hard time applying traditional technicals to thin markets like $TSLA or to cult stocks. This is a double whammy. But your point is well observed and taken. Early trade makes it look like 300 will be a battle ground.

2512 2018-06-06 13:29:41 When will you ban bump stocks and raise the minimum age for firearm ownership to 21? I'm sure you can find one @GOP  Rep that has a spine and is not a  lap dog for the @NRA @DLoesch

Get your head out of your ass. Classic Liberal Democrat technique. Blame anyone that does not agree with you 100%.

2547 2018-06-06 13:15:24 Banks have a problem.
Another point: What happens when you in fact "tokenize" regular stocks. What if stocks get tradable as easily as crypto assets? Talking about game changers. Whole centralized exchanges can become obsolete.
2548 2018-06-06 13:14:37 I think of the S&P more like a country club for stocks. The minute you're in the S&P, you have a systemic tailwind of demand behind your shares. The "selling" is mainly due to M&A, which I would call winners if price return is what we're looking for.

One of those is the S&P 500, and Twitter is now so mainstream that it’s now 1 of those 500!

Guest on @BloombergTV talking about #CORN being big winner in a China trade deal. Yet absurd USDA estimate has U.S. exports declining -125M bushels. If our exports are actually up +150M, we’re looking at ending stocks overstated error of nearly 300M bushels!
2584 2018-06-06 13:06:07 Small Cap and Large Cap stocks like Avanti Feeds (up 15%), Bajaj Electrical, Zydus, Allahabad Bank, KEC International, Mastek gained 5-10%.
2585 2018-06-06 13:05:55 Banking and NBFC stocks like SBI, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank, Bajaj Finance, Shriram Transport Finance and M&M Finance gained 2-4%.
2586 2018-06-06 13:05:51 These articles by the press but nothing really is being done. I have started up programmes for young actors in my home city of Birmingham and north west with no funding (other than my own). I would never wish on anyone to go through what I did just to try and follow a dream.
2587 2018-06-06 13:05:39 Metal stocks like Hindalco gained over 2% to close at Rs248 on account of increased base metal price on LME.

2593 2018-06-06 13:04:01 No need for speculation here. The volume of BB’s coupled w/ easy money backdrop & boosted EPS has been more than sufficient to propel these stocks higher through normal channels. Monetary pol is shifting, and BB’s will slow next year, while EPS is now peaking. Negative catalysts.
2594 2018-06-06 13:03:13 U.S. stock index futures rising with Wall Street’s renewed interest in technology stocks poised to push the Nasdaq to another record high amid signs of easing trade tensions

2607 2018-06-06 12:59:05 May was  characterized by sharp fall in Mid and small cap stocks.

Even on a trailing 12 month  basis, MidCap returns at 8% is lower than Nifty's 12%.

2622 2018-06-06 12:52:48 I used to get my stocks handed to me by @RetnuahTard  all the time when I first started, but ovetime I just kept grinding out MUs, watching VODs and asking people for advice over and over. I constantly kept playing till I could push past the wall known as @RetnuahTard
2623 2018-06-06 12:51:10 So true. We are trying to make a difference with @actorawareness and look what we have done with the most minimal of money. Imagine what we could do with funding. But the big wigs at the top still can't see the problem and because it's hard to prove your class they don't touch it

2683 2018-06-06 12:15:50 That wasn’t the point. Trump specifically said he would ban bump stocks and raise the buying age. Then within a few days the NRA shows up at the White House and Trump never says a word about it again.

2703 2018-06-06 12:04:30 Investors buy stocks for various reasons. 
- Capital appreciation, which occurs when a stock rises in price
- Dividend payments, which come when the company distributes some of its earnings to stockholders

2704 2018-06-06 12:04:05 I pay attention to investor sentiment. 2009-13 most seemed unsure... and licking their wounds. They questioned their beliefs and reevaluated what they believed they knew and what they were doing.

2715 2018-06-06 11:53:59 For SIG to be providing custody solution for Bitcoin, when they are not even in the custody game, is significant.

3041 2018-06-06 07:24:32 $NVCN These types of stocks use all types of deceptive practices. If you're going to get in, know the game. Notice how the volume was cut in half on the very next day after the Reverse Stock Split was approved. Not a coincidence. Don't fall for the games. They control everything
3042 2018-06-06 07:23:44 Which is easier? Looking for stocks that "can be" leaders in the next bull market or invest in stocks that consistently perform in every kind of market. 
Why complicate things?
3043 2018-06-06 07:22:30 I prefer buying stocks when they break out from some level... eg. 3 to 6 months range. I also like stocks trading near 52 week highs. My risk in all these trades is under 1% of my capital so it does not hit me if a trade goes wrong.

3047 2018-06-06 07:20:14 Each stocks will have their own reversal levels. Stocks which are at 52 week lows would have broken their supports a long time ago. It will take some time for a buy signal to come in these stocks.

3055 2018-06-06 07:13:25 This is also why politics has become so polarized. It's tied into hash words. The more reactions a hash gets like #2A the more blockchain can be built on ICPs which help cryptocurrency values to go up. This is why every time a school shooting stocks go up.
3056 2018-06-06 07:12:27 But to catch a reversal if you wait for stocks to make new 52week highs it'll be too late by then.
3057 2018-06-06 07:12:24 actually unemployment overall has went down, I mean for God's sake we were in a recession after 9-11, the world stood still, stocks dropped businesses pulled their help wanted ads across the country, it was panic, it has taken years to dig ourselves out. Peace.
3058 2018-06-06 07:10:46 Rebounding commodity prices and stronger-than-expected economic growth figures buoyed Australian stocks as the equities market rose broadly after yesterday's weakness. The S&P/ASX 200 index advanced 0.5% to 6025.1 as energy stocks jumped 2.4% and materials climbed 1.6%.

3060 2018-06-06 07:10:19 When I was young, I thought that the economy meant stocks and shares, currency trading, the things that rich people do with their money. I had no idea that it touched on my life in any way. Many people seem to think like that but I'd hope that politicians at least knew better.

3080 2018-06-06 06:52:32 I'm also no expert, but isn't that how the stock market is meant to work? Company A acquires/merges with Company B, Company A increases in value by the value of Company B. Company A can fund purchase by creating more stocks in the soon to be larger company.
3081 2018-06-06 06:52:26 Hello... you can also look at no of stocks making 52 week highs versus low. Yesterday 4 stocks made 52 week highs and 384 stocks made 52 week lows. This is bad as the index is barely 5% away from all time highs.

3085 2018-06-06 06:50:01 Yes, I am really surprised that people sell their assets in the stock market at will and with a whim. Before we sell our flat or even scooty we think twice about it, but for stocks it's not like it.
3086 2018-06-06 06:49:47 are there stocks already?

3100 2018-06-06 06:38:11 It's very volatile. You can wait for 4th gen(it's in 3rd) and not really lose anything. Use this time to practice is my advice. Don't commit any significant money. Instead get used to investing. Apply that to stocks later if you want.
3101 2018-06-06 06:36:36 He’s 19. It’s like buying stocks in a tech startup. No dividends expected today but expectation of massive rewards tomorrow.

If you are going to sell, my recommendation is to wait to sell into an extended hourly move. #SPX
3110 2018-06-06 06:27:52 SKM EGG .. the fall from 140 to 78 in a short span looks so severe ... why could it be? what is that v r not aware of ?  .. making me defensive ... there are other stocks around .. why just eggs? there is milk too ! bread too !

3113 2018-06-06 06:23:44 Whenever I have blindly followed others' advice on buying stocks, I have mostly lost. Even if they were correct on the entry, I did not know when to exit.  I have learnt that there is no easy money in this world.

3115 2018-06-06 06:23:25 Consumer stocks being market favorite is actually an indication of lack of opportunities in other industries. Its expansion of P/E in consumer stocks.

Consumption is not really rising at fast clip, certainly not more than what is normally expected under 5-7% GDP growth.
3116 2018-06-06 06:22:33 Having said that, I think quiet a few stocks are available at good levels. Have been shopping.

One always have needs to be stock specific. Add stocks where one has conviction and available at price below the intrinsic value.

3136 2018-06-06 06:10:28 Again we are reminding,

Many Small-cap stocks went up 4 to 6X in 2017 & it's not possible to sustain consistently, they have to correct 

So if they are falling you must enjoy as you enjoyed when they were going up, nothing goes much longer on a 45d degree angle

3149 2018-06-06 05:56:48 Honestly, people who can't even recognize the differences between net worth, assets, stocks and actual monetary wealth shouldn't be making comments about the rich and what they believe they should be doing.

3158 2018-06-06 05:50:16 Being low liquidity, SME stocks are very easy to manipulate, any positive comment on social media can shoot up the price. I have more than 1% holding in Lancer as visible from BSE and might continue holding but commenting anything on stock price (bullish/bearish) won't be fair.

3160 2018-06-06 05:47:13 The devil is in the details. Exactly what nominal (& real) interest rates are too high?  Graduate student loans currently charge about 7%. That's pretty expensive rent.  But if 7% is acceptable, then that debt should definitely be prioritized over investing in stocks/bonds.

3174 2018-06-06 05:36:32 Some chatter that mid/small corrected so Nifty should follow. But won’t the relative performance focused money  shift to large caps/ nifty stocks - hence the recent outperformance. Just a guess.

3191 2018-06-06 05:23:20 No trading/markets necessary, hence no listing, simply enable a wallet and allow withdrawals.  

Is this an abstract concept?   A listing is to enable market trading...not asking for that, not even close. 

Hey maybe when my stocks split, I only get the ones I owned before 
3192 2018-06-06 05:23:16 $APT Stocks recovering immediately after getting hit is super bullish!! Shake out complete and ready for new highs and $10+.

From Fisher=learnt one must hold stocks for long term.
3203 2018-06-06 05:15:33 That’s the law, anything that is a choice, like stocks, real estate, I will not. And that is what I tell my biz friends as well. Do not invest under this govt. They will just steal.

3218 2018-06-06 05:03:04 Microsoft’s marketcap has increased 4x since acquiring Skype for $8.5b in 2011. If it was an all-stock deal instead of all-cash, the $8.5b in stocks would be worth ~$35b today. 

Within 2 years of acquisition, Skype userbase and revenues would double (from ~$1b to ~$2b).

3229 2018-06-06 04:55:01 I am not saying we are to spend our way out of debt. I am saying that when a massive crisis hits, like the Great Depression of 1929 or the 2008 Great Recession, people start losing their jobs, their stocks/401k starts devaluing as the stock market tumbles...
3230 2018-06-06 04:54:25 All #crypto assets combined are valued at less than 1% of global GDP. Tech stocks on the other hand were valued at 30% of global GDP at the height of dot com mania. Thats the scale of a bubble #bitcoin #blockchain #cryptocurrency
3231 2018-06-06 04:51:48 Indices are green and majority believes sharp recovery ahead. I continue to believe it to be lower top lower bottom kind of trend . Use the bounce back to exit from low quality/momentum driven stocks #deadcatbounce
3232 2018-06-06 04:51:30 When FIIs take out money from India the stocks should fall. But, probably my manipulations, stock markerts are kept high. Net result is country loss to the country.

3237 2018-06-06 04:47:23 So many so called "crypto experts" give importance to metrics  that might work for stocks but are not accurate metrics to measure lets say actual utility, security, or adoption.  (2)
3238 2018-06-06 04:46:52 Buy FUTURE PROOF stocks.
Like Consumption (QSR + FMCG), Aviation, Branded Commodity (RICE) & Education (IT & IOT space).

Don't prefer stocks from ... any sector or businesses which have too much of government interference (PSU, Sugar, Medical & Pharma)

Choose wisely .. 
3239 2018-06-06 04:46:50 And show 20 years of full tax returns.

3240 2018-06-06 04:46:41 That's not your solution, it's Nancy Pelosis solution. Building bridges? Really? Then if you get gay cakes, we get to keep our bump stocks? Sounds reasonable to me. Let's hurry and tell the Supreme court we worked it out then.
3241 2018-06-06 04:46:33 Happy to read this! Safer schools and gun safety reform are my number one concern. Banning bump stocks is a must! I’d rather military-style weapons be banned for civilians but I’ll take what I can get. I’d never vote for a candidate that accepted NRA blood money. James Smith:

3249 2018-06-06 04:40:27 They just release new items today, so the line was quite long. Go to the store at least an hour or 2 before 11, because stocks get sold out pretty quick. 
3250 2018-06-06 04:39:50 The 'run away' auditors won't come back & that is a reality, but the sound, fundamentally strong stocks will move up on the back of investors seeing value in them. That is the basic difference between perceptive value vs. reality.

3258 2018-06-06 04:36:26 No correlation. Medical use of cannabis in no way is a treat to owning big pharma stocks. Moral reasons, social stigma, legal reasons against legalization makes more sense.

3261 2018-06-06 04:35:38 Why don't you charge the people who hold stocks every year?  Oh wait because you only tax money invested else where when it is realized profit.  Do the same for houses. Taxing unrealized wealth is not done else where or to big business.  Change the name to Unrealized Wealth Tax.

3308 2018-06-06 04:05:45 What we need is #GunReformNow.  Hey, remember that time you said you would ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21? Are you afraid of the @NRA @realDonaldTrump ?
3309 2018-06-06 04:05:41 Sorry $GCO shareholders, short seller Brian McDougal hired me to drive down the share price of Genesco. I bought some shares and as expected, down 9%. I put the "Lids" on it. Nice doing business with you Brian. #stocks

3311 2018-06-06 04:05:11 It's a systematic sell off.. Slowly the stocks are sold without much impacting the index. Reason :- if index shows panic, then who are waiting for recovery will also sell n run away.. Game plan
3312 2018-06-06 04:04:01 He did ban bump stocks. Legislation is almost complete. Try staying current fat boy

3314 2018-06-06 03:58:17 Says the phony president.    Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”

No rate hike, no ultra hawkish commentary: Bank Nifty moves towards 26500-600 levels 
#Nifty could move towards 10650-70 levels

3330 2018-06-06 03:42:31 Today is RBI credit policy. Before policy big players are huge in short side.
Looking into these big short positions in index and stocks seems RBI is planning to increase the interest rates and market can fall big. let us see how it goes......................
3331 2018-06-06 03:41:53 Yes, they can do byproduct but there is already lot of byproducts are in stocks. Hope this is correct decision otherwise they may run under debt.

3481 2018-06-06 02:12:41 WSJ story is deeply broken. Value as an analytical style is a four part investing system: 1) a share is a partial interest in a business, 2) Mr Market is bipolar, 3) margin of safety (a bargain including re quality) and 4) be rational. It has nothing to do with "cheap stocks."

That’s because there was nothing to recover from. Jobs, stocks and GDP are rising under Trump, just as they did under Obama. In fact, by almost every measure, the performance of the economy under Trump is indistinguishable from Obama’s second term.

3513 2018-06-06 01:54:29 When stocks have an abnormal rise, it is our stock picking ability. When stocks have an abnormal fall, it is global cues, bear operators etc.

3516 2018-06-06 01:53:38 high stocks do not mean the economy is great, and unemployment takes YEARS for a president to effect. If they are this low in 2 years I will give him credit for it.

3563 2018-06-06 01:18:32 The second season is going to be amazing. Thinking about buying stocks in a popcorn company.
3564 2018-06-06 01:18:01 How about instead of watching tv, you go find all the missing kids?  Or maybe ban bump stocks?  Or send help to Puerto Rico? Or tell Sessions to change your administration policy if ripping children away from their parents?  Or even learn the words to God Bless America?
3565 2018-06-06 01:16:29 I’m amazed at how little Americans know about how a free market system works. Getting paid minimum wage? PLAY STOCKS AND ADOPT SOME CHILDREN! That oughta straighten your financial troubles out.
3566 2018-06-06 01:16:22 #Investing 

In times of a big carnage (Midcaps now), people favour diversification. 

My point is, in stock markets, 1/10 stocks can always go down 60-70%. 
If the business is good, HOW does it matter? As long as you don't have to sell, it should again reflect the main biz.
3567 2018-06-06 01:15:28 It seems like your initial purchase was after a correction (10 - 20% drop in the price). I’d wait for another dip (5 - 10% drop in price) then buy again. Disclosure: I don’t actively trade stocks, i just buy mutuals and let them sit.
3568 2018-06-06 01:14:05 Omg. What kind of president speaks like this? I cry every night that we are the laughing stocks of the world. You aren’t a tv host. Please stop. Get some dignity
3569 2018-06-06 01:13:41 Ban bump stocks even though no one owns one.  At least it would be some kind of movement. But it won’t happen because trump and the GOP are owned by the NRA.
3570 2018-06-06 01:11:53 #NFLBoycott #NFl. Even though u have apeased the President he want stop until your stocks plumnet .U r fools for creating this policy!
3571 2018-06-06 01:11:10 I voted today!  Let's work together too ban bump stocks.

3575 2018-06-06 01:08:04 They would have thought he was a criminal buffoon. They would have organized a revolt and have him physically removed from office and put in stocks until trial, for all to see the traitor. Then he would stand in a firing line.
3576 2018-06-06 01:07:53 Great breakdown of stocks by @timseymour !
3577 2018-06-06 01:07:00 I live in a town of 250 people in southern Illinois so I really don't care if I sound racist. Hell I am a redneck but I'm tired of the "My second amendment rights Trump your first amendment rights. No way the founding fathers envisioned bump stocks
3578 2018-06-06 01:06:03 Because they included market makers in the sample, not just predatory HFTs. It's from a study on Euronext Paris for the CAC 40 stocks, conducted by the French Market Authority.
3579 2018-06-06 01:05:52 The nra called for the ban of bump stocks. What does 21 do?  Can we raise the age to vote too?
3580 2018-06-06 01:05:31 You're one hell of a salesman.  I know lots of gun owners that never even wanted bump stocks because they're stupid and bought one just to have as a keepsake.  Keep up the awesome work Lil man.
3581 2018-06-06 01:05:31 Noticed most  negative comments come from those with less than 25 followers.
3582 2018-06-06 01:05:09 Investors who are buying more mid and small cap stocks in this fall to average their cost will soon realise that some stocks would never return to 2018 highs. Only the quality will make new high, and only by looking at the past in the future will tell where the quality was.

3592 2018-06-06 00:59:27 @realDonaldTrump I believe in you and you have hard decisions ahead of you but please find out the status on bump stocks? Please ban them. Show the left you haven't forgotten. Thank you. Please retweet me.
3593 2018-06-06 00:58:33 Glad we could help you and thanks for the kind words. Have a wonderful week.
3594 2018-06-06 00:57:52 We support him because he supports our flag , military , law enforcement , lowest unemployment for blacks , high employment , gdp , help put an end to Korean War since the 1950s, passed a law to give people who are sick first trial of trial drugs , stocks , etc 
3595 2018-06-06 00:57:02 If you’re sticking around Mitch to make sure and pass gun laws including eliminating bump stocks and health care for all and DACA I’m all for it but if you’re sticking around to try and approve a worthless wall or more tax breaks for the rich..please go on vacation.

3603 2018-06-06 00:50:30 Sustained sales declines would be dreadful for $TIF.
My point is across businesses/stocks rather than the supply of a given good.
3604 2018-06-06 00:50:10 Once these, Ibulls venture, HEG, Graphite LC open, and start trading normally for 2-3 hours,  then we may see small/midcap bouncing back...

So watch these ASM stocks very closely..they are having huge significance in this money game.

3606 2018-06-06 00:49:34 A person has already been taxed on the funds used to purchase their home or their stocks. Why should they be doubly taxed? Most of us make home improvements on our homes before we sell them...that is adding value. The funds used for investing in a company increase its value.
3607 2018-06-06 00:48:55 I hear you but something is going to break towards the end of June and July something huge crashing the markets that's how I see stocks ... The dollar should go up and the Euro should crush..imo
3608 2018-06-06 00:48:52 For the record I rarely short stocks. I usually don’t know enough about them. Occasionally I buy puts so the risk is defined. At any rate, it is really hard for a stock to maintain momentum once rsi gets over 90
3609 2018-06-06 00:48:28 So much for the old adage "Sell in May..." increasingly these old sayings seem to be becoming obsolete. Last two years was good to stay in, and a review of the Markets through an ETF lens shows growth stocks punching higher. Last 5 weeks; great run!

3621 2018-06-06 00:38:57 This is a lie. The stocks may have gained that, but it doesn't equate to economic growth.  You haven't a clue about economics; all you focus on is your previous stock market, which has little to no effect on 90% of American households. Lying con man.

3639 2018-06-06 00:21:50 I wish. Right now I’m still paying down debt. Hopefully I can get back to saving soon.

I also wish I hadn’t had to sell my stocks to survive. 700% gains since I sold. One of them was 2000% (though, honestly, I would never have held on this long anyway).
3640 2018-06-06 00:20:09 Sorry pumpkin. Stocks and investment property income. I can pull as much as I want, no government restrictions there. Nothing to do with my 401K. I told you republicans suck at math.
3641 2018-06-06 00:19:03 not interesting. all the charts are the same shape, i.e. they're all more or less heavily invested in the same stocks. You didn't charge fees for that performance, did you?

3650 2018-06-06 00:06:14 No doubt markets will remain cyclical.  But the game HAS changed & many of the old adages are not as applicable. (1) Equities are dominated now by institutions. Much less of a meaningful dumb "public" to slam-dunk bet against. (2) Bonds are shit everywhere; stocks are it for now.
3651 2018-06-06 00:04:25 A lot!! Like healthcare and exactly the legislation and policies that republicans have been putting in place to drive up the costs. The economy and how the companies who have benefitted from the tax cut are using it to primarily buy back stocks. The regulations being rescinded.

3655 2018-06-06 00:02:17 That’s assuming a 10% correction tomorrow. Housing is not as liquid as stocks. Takes a little longer for a 10% correction than overnight. As for vacancy rates, it’s 5km from the CBD of Toronto. Unless the world reverses global urbanization I think the vacancy rates will be fine.
