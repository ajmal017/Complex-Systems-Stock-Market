1 2018-11-22 23:59:18 Sooner or later, the left is going to have to admit the liberal lie about what Patton said, or are you people going to wait until we get our ass handed to us playing war for oil/opium? Technically NASA STS shouldn't have happened failing delivery of Mach 5 Blackbird. Waste...

All said about Assad is lies. People love him. Assad love it's multi culture, mutli religion citisens and they LOVE Assad. President Assad elected by democratic vote.
Every against President Assad is about world cartels for oil & gas. paths

7 2018-11-22 23:58:59 The US produces more oil/gas than anyone. Their exports are going way up. Their domestic use is falling. They have multiple facilities making wind turbines, solar panels, batteries, biofuels. Canada has none. Its the US that is making solutions happen while  talks & says NO.
8 2018-11-22 23:58:52 So mas gusto nyo solohin ng China ang oil? Idiocracy beyond epic proportions
9 2018-11-22 23:58:44 No, the price of Alberta “oil” is low because #dilbit is #FilthNotWealth.  Its liabilities exceed its use value, much light crude exists to use up first in a carbon-constrained sea-life-preserving world.  

Go mine #vanadium from #TarSandsTailingsPonds and stop whining.
10 2018-11-22 23:58:43 @DanaPerino You are so transparent. Why didnt you mention about George W. BeingVery close with the Saudi's? While you were his press Secretary, and you knew how the women are oppressed. How hypocritical are you? He went after Iraq instead of Saudi's!!! Oil!
11 2018-11-22 23:58:35 i put peppermint oil on my cheeks & yall i feel like I’m burning in hell WTF IS THIS
12 2018-11-22 23:58:29 No, it's not `as well': it's the only thing. We are currently harming Canadians by stopping our environmentally responsible resources being developed while buying oil from people like Saudi Arabia & Nigeria. It's insane.
13 2018-11-22 23:58:20 He's a smart ruthless snake oil salesmen that spends way too much time looking at himself in the mirror.  Check your pockets after you part ways.
14 2018-11-22 23:58:09 Why don’t you practice what you preach ?  You know, serve all your constituents instead of just those you are beholden to at the expense of the state you represent. NRA?  Big Sugar ? Oil and Gas ?  Leaving a big toxic mess behind you-harming people, wildlife and economy
15 2018-11-22 23:58:09 Considering oil prices going down; maybe he just means Mohammed Bin Zayed!!!!
16 2018-11-22 23:57:56 Canada provides 40% of oil,  Saudis only provide 9%, Yet Trump is nasty to Canada and nice to Saudis....... I wonder Why@

39 2018-11-22 23:57:48 Gas cars emit even more, wells to wheels. Your claim about coal-fired was already refuted for BC, the location of this article. EVs can also get cleaner from different electrical sources; gas cars can't. Oil sources get dirtier as we run out & drill in tar sands, for example.
40 2018-11-22 23:57:42 Rees-Mogg, Raab, Paterson, IDS, Baker, McVey, Fox, Grayling... ERG Brextremists are our Trump. A self-serving elite posing as defenders of the workers. Populists promising the Earth to anyone who'll buy their brand of snake oil. How the hell did we get here? #bbcqt
41 2018-11-22 23:57:32 Sooner or later Cdns may realize the impact of losing a St Paul hospital or a new LRT line in their city every 28 days, doable at world price .

良い天気になりましたね
今日は紫の服でも着て
行こうかなぁ(笑)
46 2018-11-22 23:56:25 The only question is WHY is this earth saving technology on the back burner?  What do you think a publicized large scale project would do to oil stocks?
47 2018-11-22 23:56:20 下りも今日は指定席全席取れないって駅に張り出されてした！
48 2018-11-22 23:56:16 Very Stable Genius, so the Saudis lowered oil prices so they could kill whoever they wanted and you would approve?  Is that what you are trying to say?
49 2018-11-22 23:56:09 They're so good~ I think I heard you can use peanut oil on 12 Turkeys
50 2018-11-22 23:56:06 石油[タンク]︰an oil [tank]
51 2018-11-22 23:55:49  may I have the recipe please? no idea where I might get pomegranate oil, but damn, I'll get it.
52 2018-11-22 23:55:42 Happy thanksgiving I hope everyone is hitting their Premium  Crafted Cannabis oil cartridges today 
53 2018-11-22 23:55:35 上り指定席なかったよ
54 2018-11-22 23:55:29 We should respect the the snake oil salesman who wants to give us LESS HEALTHCARE!
55 2018-11-22 23:55:14 Shame cos they're making a big stand for our environment with their anti palm oil campaign.
56 2018-11-22 23:55:05 Marty be fucked me in a bath filled with spaghetti and oil
57 2018-11-22 23:55:01 Well they cant threaten the world with oil embargoes anymore
58 2018-11-22 23:54:54 now if you could add the oil & gas Co. you would have a full house .
59 2018-11-22 23:54:50 Snake oil.
60 2018-11-22 23:54:45 You mean your plan to destroy the oil and gas industry and with it the entire middle class. While creating a nation of welfare recipients.
61 2018-11-22 23:54:44 Sana oil
62 2018-11-22 23:54:41 @NBCNews @NBCPolitics @CBSNews @ABCPolitics @ABC @CNN @cnnbrk @MSNBC Why has no one pointed out that the U.S. gets only 9% of its total oil imports from Saudi Arabia?? We get most of our oil from Canada ffs! So Trump’s excuses re Khashoggi & MBS are bullshit lies.
63 2018-11-22 23:54:35 Price is not propped up. We simply have a reduced demand due to lack of delivery capacity west, east or south in Canada. It’s a Cdn govt made supply-demand imbalance. There is plenty of demand if you can get oil to the west or east coast or south.
64 2018-11-22 23:54:08 Oil and water have more chemistry than Phil and Kat.
65 2018-11-22 23:54:03 Next up:  Trump regales us with tales of whalers, tears in their eyes, thanking him for bringing back whale oil.
66 2018-11-22 23:53:55 Always dodging the questions and steering back to talking points. It truly is insulting to those who have had their livelihoods destroyed by the inaction of, and seemingly planned destruction of the oil and gas industry by our current gov’t...  this must change, and soon!
67 2018-11-22 23:53:35 I know McKay First Nations are one of the wealthiest First Nations in Canada and is now consider a town and no longer has that archaic status,  simply by being partners in the Oil Sands.

70 2018-11-22 23:53:10 .@JustinTrudeau & @liberal_party dont work for Canada or Canadians. Politely asking him to stop fucking up our oil industry is not going to work. He wants a "post national" Canada, a strong Canadian energy industry & an unbiased press are obstacles in his way on his road to ruin.
71 2018-11-22 23:52:50 Hhhhh the easiest chart now is the Oil chart. The Oil is down. The stupid people are those who face the hurricane. Trump said he need Oil prices down, what are you expecting ?
72 2018-11-22 23:52:43 I have enjoyed having CBD Oil for Vaping when I'm out in public. I'm having an awesome sale tomorrow of you would Iike to look at everything?

74 2018-11-22 23:52:20 After telling us to be Thankful to Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices - you don’t shush me with your total disrespect for the American people
75 2018-11-22 23:52:12 Things that are somehow still in my brain 2+ years after leaving the oil and gas beat: how many litres are in a barrel of oil; the stock ticker symbols for various oilpatch companies.
76 2018-11-22 23:51:39 誕生日おめでとうございます素敵な一年を過ごせますように
77 2018-11-22 23:51:33 That would make sense since he has publicly  stated he wants the oil sands phased out. This is the beginning.
78 2018-11-22 23:51:28 I went crazy easy. I did remove the spine and press, obviously, but the rest was nothing but letting it dry/get to temperature and adding coconut oil and garlic powder. It was more experiment than anything since I'm alone this year. Totally worth it.
79 2018-11-22 23:51:28 @blacknymph conditioner with oil and water worked magically
80 2018-11-22 23:51:08 i like truffle oil :(

82 2018-11-22 23:50:59 I’m thankful for weed and booze!  God bless America! Also looks like I got a new job!  Now I’m work at Taco Bell.  I swear I won’t piss in the fry oil.  Wipe my ass with burger patties.  Show up to work lit, cuss out a customer via the drive thru or smoke weed in the bathroom.
83 2018-11-22 23:50:52 Shadowy figure in an alleyway opening a trench coat:

“Hey kid wanna try some of this... CBD OIL??”
84 2018-11-22 23:50:47 Which oil company gave you the most money to tweet this Donnie? Or is it that you are just this stupid? Which is it Donnie? Corrupt or stupid?
85 2018-11-22 23:50:45 Whether or not my 150-odd Telus package is sufficient is immaterial. 
Why is an ex-PM kid a bad choice? The Mulroney daughter is in politics. Is she bad? 
Is JT a card-carrying communist? Or are you, as I suspect, just talking from out your ass? 
The price of oil is not set here.
86 2018-11-22 23:50:35 1. It was a 6 lb roast. Rub with rosemary garlic rock salt pepper and olive oil. Nest over foil balls or a rack. Add red wine (i used a cab) and beef stock to bottom of pan just to the roast, it shouldn’t swim in it.
87 2018-11-22 23:50:34 Why have you thought about trying CBD Oil Products?
88 2018-11-22 23:49:57 Damn right the Iran deal was part of the reason oil dropped dramatically in 2014 the oil corporations threw a fit that's why GOP's been crying like babies about it ever since- Trump didn't understand the consequences of reimposing sanctions- should have kept the Iran deal
89 2018-11-22 23:49:49 US imposed sanctions on people because they exported oil from Iran in violation of its embargo, not because it was sent to Syria, for the winter or otherwise. The US didn’t impose sanctions on anyone sending oil to Syria from Iraq, Qatar, or anywhere else.
90 2018-11-22 23:49:26 Depends on the pasta 
Sometimes just adding oil and chilpep with a few tomatoes is all a person needs in life 
Cheap eats

92 2018-11-22 23:49:14 Oh my goodness, you are such a grave woman - a true fighter. Have you ever consider CBD Hemp Oil for your #painmanagement ? DM if you are interested 
93 2018-11-22 23:49:04 Hm I rlly want to try learning oil painting but it takes up a lot of time and money and I’m Scared of Commitment
94 2018-11-22 23:48:59 Build some pipelines! Support cdn oil
95 2018-11-22 23:48:54 He’s  a pure asshole, if oil industry was in the east a pipeline would have been started immediately with not-withstanding clause
96 2018-11-22 23:48:51 A friend who is an avid meat eater has just shared an article about why we shouldn't boycott palm oil because animal agriculture and soy is responsible for deforestation on a much larger scale. In the article it states that only 6% of soy harvested is consumed by humans,
97 2018-11-22 23:48:41 "Snake Oil Salesman says Snake Oil is now mainstream". Oh, Deepak. You're so adorable.
98 2018-11-22 23:48:33 trying to rubberstamp tmx is what got us here. And i for one am enjoying gas under $1 per liter. the price of “everything” should drop accordingly. The differential sucks, but why should oil be propped up artificially at cost to consumers?
99 2018-11-22 23:48:32 CIA: We can confirm that MBS ordered the killing of American journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Predator trump: That’s premature, they are great and MAGA.

CIA: But we have a recording of him ordering the murder.

Predator trump: Oh well. But oil! I’m thankful for myself, MAGA!
100 2018-11-22 23:48:31 Oh totally. It’s big science trying to steal money from the fragile, good natured oil biz. And yeah I can’t think of a single biblical example when God allowed human actions to change the planet. Except Eden, Noah,the Red Sea, Babylon, and all of revelations. You’re an idiot.
101 2018-11-22 23:48:12 دولة؟

102 2018-11-22 23:48:07 Get yourself an oiless fryer. All the goodness of fried turkey without the hassle of oil.
103 2018-11-22 23:47:58 How can you have the chairman of Iceland on and not ask the question about palm oil?
#bbcqt
104 2018-11-22 23:47:50 Imagine being a "pro oil protestor."
105 2018-11-22 23:47:44 I need a Black Friday deal on an oil change
106 2018-11-22 23:47:44 Mussi oil cauuuuuuuuuuuusseeeeee
107 2018-11-22 23:47:31 #bbcqt sorry there wasn't a question on the palm oil advert
108 2018-11-22 23:47:29 “Don’t worry about me baby girl, you know I’m gonna get out. Just worry about school and getting your oil change.” 
Literally almost cried, bc my grandpa is still over here thinking about me while he’s in the hospital. 
109 2018-11-22 23:47:28 Everyone is drinking with their family and then there’s my saved and sanctified family .. we drinking blessed oil 
110 2018-11-22 23:47:16 vegan butter but yeah. little olive oil too. celery and carrots and lentils (i can't do onions they kill me) and then once the vegetables are soft throw the bread in, mix till the consistency of meatloaf, and then put in the oven
111 2018-11-22 23:47:12 Obviously I understand that. But Trump's uninformed ramblings refer to the price of gasoline!
Not to crude, unrefined oil.
112 2018-11-22 23:47:09 oh wont someone think of the oil industry
113 2018-11-22 23:47:07 If you know you get hives (which you should its your body) why wouldn't you read the ingredient list before using it? And as for the staining simply use an oil based make-up remover to better remove the pigment. As a makeup consumer you should know these things...
114 2018-11-22 23:46:54 He built four and approved Northern Gateway. The oil industry in 20% of Canadian GDP, it needs to be supported. You are not going to get all the other , wind solar power replace it in the near term. I watched a Liberal government raise my Hydro bills by double improve my life
115 2018-11-22 23:46:49 Nicki, I have just read about your many ordeals, especially your physical pain. I wonder if you've ever considered CBD Hemp Oil for your daily #painmanagement . DM if you want to find out more 
116 2018-11-22 23:46:42 I did, thanks, they seemed like snake oil merchants from the start! Especially liked your analysis of their ‘viral’ video and true costs!
117 2018-11-22 23:46:33 Sinopec and some first nations groups want to build a refinery. Make it happen. US refiners are making a killing taking our oil and selling refined products back to us - Why? Consumers in Canada are paying more for gas than in the US -Why?
118 2018-11-22 23:46:22 Saudi Arabia has nothing to do with American jobs. They have little to do with American oil. Since they only provide 11%. They do provide Trump and his family with a good bit of money.
119 2018-11-22 23:46:17 The oil industry pays for your welfare cheque
120 2018-11-22 23:45:53 Heard the same from some trumpet I work with  Yeah we’re making a loss let’s keep pumping out the oil... What kind of idiot believes this tripe?? 
121 2018-11-22 23:45:18 Don't sell off your land you'll need it and the beef etc when oil hoes totally under as its a has been dirty non renewable

125 2018-11-22 23:45:08 In other words AB is screwed unless BC agrees to allow a pipeline, they could even ban rail traffic. The only way AB could get their oil to market would be through the states. And that's not going well at the moment.
126 2018-11-22 23:45:08 aaaaaaa chipotle olive oil smells so good when it's heating up

133 2018-11-22 23:44:12 Fried turkeys are very moist,
flavorful.  But dummies put
too much oil in fryer, turkey
overflows it onto burner and flash fire results. Or, they put
frozen turkey in the oil, then moisture in it turns to steam,
frothed oil spills over.  Same
result:  #fire.
134 2018-11-22 23:44:03 UK Foreign Office once again shown to be utterly useless in the modern world, kow towing to every despotic oil rich nation. It will get worse when we leave the EU and become even more insignificant.

136 2018-11-22 23:43:54 Hi there, actually, they are allowed to do their jobs. No one and nothing is stopping them from doing their jobs. Stop lying. Stop trying to change the narrative away from the Saudi Arabians murdering Kashoggi. You’re paying blood for oil.
137 2018-11-22 23:43:44 he goes 'I hate renaissance art bc it's religious' and i'm like 'well duh what's more awe-inspiring than the blind and hopeful faith of many translated into heaven-sent brushstrokes of cryptic oil and permanent acrylic; you can royally suck on your staunch atheism mate'
138 2018-11-22 23:43:29 Tatum, I read about your illnesses. You are a warrior, that's for sure. I wonder if you have ever tried CBD Hemp Oil. DM me if you want to find out more 
139 2018-11-22 23:43:04 I suggest the failure of a PM step down. He's brought this on by blocking any chance of getting oil to tide water.
140 2018-11-22 23:43:04 I’ve a cloud of fried oil smell following me around. You’re welcome.
141 2018-11-22 23:43:03 Hey @JustinTrudeau you've admitted the low oil prices in Alberta are a crisis. What's your plan to fix this?
142 2018-11-22 23:42:57 A lot has changed since 2015. First oil prices fell into the 20’s in 2015. Oil exports were not allowed, and LNG export facilities were not yet built The reg. regime was not friendly to oil/gas. And the industry has improved efficiency. So no don’t expect 2015 repeat in oil/gas

146 2018-11-22 23:42:38 It's as if the world is shocked that Arab oil men with bottomless caches of money, free from accountability, and able to spend as they please, where they please, could possibly be corrupt.
147 2018-11-22 23:42:34 Imported oil? Great. ALL our imports would be cheaper without the moronic #TrumpTradeWar and massive tariff taxes on America.
148 2018-11-22 23:42:19 はーい
149 2018-11-22 23:42:12 Itching sensation in the sunburn is fading and being replaced by the calming sensation of my skin being held over an oil heater.

152 2018-11-22 23:41:51 いったら構ってやってくださいな(^ー^)
153 2018-11-22 23:41:46 Sounds more like a business arrangement than for the people. Not surprising 45 to collude and collide for oil and not justice.  As the storm approaches with the Mueller investigation wraps up VOTE your truth.
154 2018-11-22 23:41:15 My point is if Saudis and Opec cut supply prices go up even if we buy all US oil. US suppliers will take advantage of higher pieces elsewhere and raise prices here too or will sell where price is higher.

156 2018-11-22 23:41:04 Seems that they bought a pipeline to get our oil to the coast but judges stopped it because of legislation you helped put in place. Guess we can blame them though for not moving fast enough to undo your and Harpers’s govt harmful work
157 2018-11-22 23:41:03 74% of the oil during the Iraq war went to Israel. I do not think white working class  Americans or White Europeans got much out of it.

159 2018-11-22 23:40:58 Let's buy #saudi oil instead of Alberta's, pmjt #govtbywwf. Our 177,000 brilliant ,educated and responsible engineers and geologists and skilled and tech in Calgary live outdoors. love our kids and clean H20 too. Our women wear hard hats. #KinderMorgan #KokaneeGroper
160 2018-11-22 23:40:54 There's been dissent but this incident with #KhashoggiMurder amplified it and gave an opportunity to spotlight it.
We seem to think of Saudi Arabia as our friend. But @saudiarabia killed our people on 9/11. I guess oil rules.
161 2018-11-22 23:40:38 #ClimateChangeIsReal 
Let oil prices go up!
Let it be the catalyst to working with true allies who respect human rights & accept scientific reality

We have already failed to outlive results of global warming
Continuing failure to #ActOnClimate invites the greatest threat to all

165 2018-11-22 23:40:30 I support these protesters and they deserve to be heard .They deserve to get help from their Goverment not the opposite .They have a PM and his attached to his hip Butts that want to keep Alberta oil in the ground.

169 2018-11-22 23:40:10 Just a little bit of oil, and... Come on! Come on, you little son of a bitch!
170 2018-11-22 23:40:01 Really? Then explain how they get there oil & gas out? They have transit agreements brought forth by the international free access laws, we’re the only nation that block our own pipelines! Dumbass
171 2018-11-22 23:39:52 If it is unacceptable to you what wiil you do? Vote against it? Force a by-election?
It would be great to be like Norway. Imagine having a trillion dollar oil fund because they did not let Tories blow it.
Imagine having control of fishing because they did not le Tories blow it.

176 2018-11-22 23:39:06 Are you really that ignorant or is it sheer stupidity?  Most of our oil was not imported from Saudi Arabia.  You are complicit in the recent assassination of a journalist.  You are sickening and I hope you rue the day you decided to run.  Your words are not our laws.
177 2018-11-22 23:39:02 We're the largest supplier of Oil in the World...USA.
178 2018-11-22 23:38:42 We get more oil from Canada than we do from Saudi.STOP LYING.STOP FEAR MONGERING. The Saudis have you by your itty bitty balls.Along with Putin.
It’s Muller Time.

180 2018-11-22 23:38:40 No we can’t force the US. But we could lobby from a position of strength by being a worthy oil/gas export competitor & use “tolls” from world price to both reduce C ftprt of our citizens and build infrastructure for global export of renewables technology. Like US is doing.
181 2018-11-22 23:38:39 I’m thankful for remembering that someone gave me vegan ice cream sandwiches and I have mint chocolate chip almond milk ice cream too. I ate a cbd oil gummy and this one had more thc than usual

184 2018-11-22 23:37:44 Alberta already has wind turbines and is a windy place in the south. It is also a very sunny place. They have other natural resources than oil.

189 2018-11-22 23:37:15 I love my grandma but she has got to be the least interesting conversationalist I’ve ever met. Just take ya fish oil pills and Centrum b ion need to know all about it. Love you tho 
190 2018-11-22 23:37:14 Gaslighting works on you. So sad. We don’t get our gas and oil from the Middle East any more. BTW, it’s already close to $3 here, has been for last 6mos. Funny, no one was complaining about it last spring.....
191 2018-11-22 23:37:06 You are right.  Follow the money. It’s leads to oil, coal, and others soon to be obsolete fuels. Open your useless head.
192 2018-11-22 23:36:52 I'd venture to say thing Albertans are more concerned about is rally for Oil. Most of those protesters are amiable, but very concerned about their livelihoods. As much as they may dislike Trudeau & think he is incompetent, they want to work more. 30% office vacancy rate attests
193 2018-11-22 23:36:39 You know what else happened in 2015, the price of oil crashed. Alberta and Canada have no impact on the price of oil.
194 2018-11-22 23:36:10 Boy that was delicious! Now comes the annoying part of cooking fondue:  opening up ALL the doors & windows to get the burnt cooking oil smell out.  :-P

197 2018-11-22 23:35:46 This is the Butts/Trudeau/McKenna plan.  They want to completely shut down the oil sands.  Now, one has to ask, if the oil sands were in Quebec...…...
198 2018-11-22 23:35:36 Crude oil went up over 50% from 2009-2012. Oil fluctuates over time.
199 2018-11-22 23:35:27 The Makeup Revolution baking oil is God-sent. It’s moisturising and it your makeup just glides on after using it and it’s so easy to blend out  makes your foundation look like skin

203 2018-11-22 23:34:31 May the souls of these young soldiers rest in peace and may God judge those that send them unprepared to die in the hands of a supposedly defeated rag tag army.The thousands of soldiers protecting oil facilities and killing Shites in Abuja should be deployed to finish Boko Haram.
204 2018-11-22 23:34:19 Can’t wait for tomorrow night when I’ll be able to hear properly and my ear won’t be oozing oil down my cheek n neck !!!!!
205 2018-11-22 23:34:14 Trump is keeping us tethered to a savage Barbarian terrorist state because they float on oil.  Disgraceful.  The US is debased even further.

208 2018-11-22 23:33:54 But you're to thank for this amazing dinner. There's never been a better dinner. It's the best because you're there. And Saudi Arabia. Don't forget to give them credit. For the oil. I mean, gravy.

214 2018-11-22 23:32:50 You excused an American citizens murderer for oil prices. This is inexcusable and probably the most abhorrent thing I’ve ever seen in my life. You must be so proud.

217 2018-11-22 23:32:23 Money for you, you mean. For your hotels and business. We the people dont want oil we want natural energy. And your right, it is a nasty world out there ever since you became president.
218 2018-11-22 23:32:18 If we are going to still be pumping oil in 2030 and beyond, and pipelines are an issue, the only solution is to upgrade/increase refining capacity on the Prairies.

What about a pipeline to a port in #Churchill, MB?

219 2018-11-22 23:32:16 The USA buys Saudi oil & gives Saudi ruling family wealth & security in return, plus agreement to allow it to continue its violent & fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, Wahhabism, uninhibited from external influence. USA helped make the region ‘mean& nasty’ & continues to do!

223 2018-11-22 23:32:10 Has he told you it’s mostly tuna fish oil yet?
224 2018-11-22 23:32:07 So the crown prince regrets the death of the man he ordered murdered?   And trump regrets it too?   Wow well as long as they both regret it, I guess that means it's okay.  So they can execute journalists and fund terrorists, but as long as they sell oil, all is peachy?
225 2018-11-22 23:31:58 @CadburyUK we are eagerly awaiting a response to the question RE your suppliers and usage of palm oil.

236 2018-11-22 23:30:54 Please explain how the PM responsible for world oil prices, and how you think ppl are only generous if they are rich. I think that's just you being greedy and petty, sweetie. The rest of humanity is okay with sharing if they don't have enough to horde.
237 2018-11-22 23:30:49 @realDonaldTrump ask saudi to pump more oil for storage in the US as a buffer in case of crisis, an oil bank.
238 2018-11-22 23:30:42 Agree.   But The big winner of the Trump presidency and the increase in oil prices has been Russia.
239 2018-11-22 23:30:37 It make me cringe when Naturalist rub their scalp with conditioner or leave in! The scalp is only for Oil and Shampoo

241 2018-11-22 23:30:32 Happy to get to work? Where have you been the past 3 years when East Coast was importing thousands of bbls of Thug Saudi oil daily?

It was very cold this morning. I brought out an oil stove for the first time this winter. Cats does not move from before the stove.

244 2018-11-22 23:30:11 No.

Atoms for peace hasn’t worked out so well.

The Saudis live on an ocean of oil. 

Why would they need nuclear power?
245 2018-11-22 23:29:58 Imagine thinking Australia is a good country as if we’re not currently plundering the Timor-Leste and trying to build oil pipes through Papua New Guinea. committing corporate espionage and making billions off of TL resources while the citizens of TL die of preventable disease 
246 2018-11-22 23:29:55 Trump: “I didn’t get upset when crown prince and Saudi “staff” cut that fake journalist into pieces. Saudis give me oil at 50 bucks a barrel. Nice gift. But does fake news give ME credit? Americans traveling all because of ME!!! Thank you Donald Trump!! F U!”

249 2018-11-22 23:29:19 Yes, I am aware of that but there are ways to put oil on the market for the highest bidders, what mktg desks r for. Its a good point about the aframax vs VLCCs tho. I don't know the implications of that. I am at an event tonight with a bunch of oil guys, I am going to ask
250 2018-11-22 23:29:10 Why is #Canada buying $300 million in oil from Saudi Arabia @JustinTrudeau ? We have a surplus of our own oil in #Alberta Let’s work on improving the Canadian economy instead of world politics @globeandmail @GlobalNational @GlobalBC
251 2018-11-22 23:29:08 CIA MUST Know The Messiah Jesus Will Explain God "Put Oil In The Land of Mecca" For Focusing The World On Mecca & The First Holy Site Built By Abraham. Thus, Focusing On Glorifying & Worshipping God, The Creator.
252 2018-11-22 23:29:08 so it looks like you learnt very well from your father on how to kill Alberta's oil and gas industry..... did you learn from Uncle Castro on how to buy  the media so it is controlled by the government ?
253 2018-11-22 23:29:01 You are an oil & gas corporation. #ClimateGenocideCollusion #ExtinctionRebellion
254 2018-11-22 23:28:52 Jamal Khasoggi  A name that the world should never forget. Disgusting that a journalist who was brave enough to speak out could be murdered so brazenly & brutally. The world turns a blind eye because of money, oil and corruption.  Where are the consequences?
255 2018-11-22 23:28:44 I've done several so: 1. They are delicious 2. They look delicious. 3. Its very easy 4. A 14 pound bird takes about an hour to cook. Cons: 3 gallons of oil costs about $30.00
256 2018-11-22 23:28:36 And I thought loading the cannabis oil was planning ahead
257 2018-11-22 23:28:27 Love the ones that are just “I (Alberta) Oil”, which is interesting fortune telling about their bones in a few centuries.
258 2018-11-22 23:28:21 I roasted a turkey in chicken broth and olive oil and goddamn, it’s simplicity lead to my finnicky children declaring is was positively delicious.
259 2018-11-22 23:28:07 Propane burner, giant pot, 5 gallons of peanut oil. 0 fatalities. 0 properties lost.
260 2018-11-22 23:28:01 I see you all are Houston based. California is a nightmare for sure, but maybe focus on your home city. The one that consistently floods. In part due to climate change from burning of said oil, but mostly due to shitty urban planning!
261 2018-11-22 23:27:57 Less than one day's worth of lost oil revenue due to the lack of pipelines
and a hell of a lot less than what was given to other countries to fight climate change (which changes no matter how much we are taxed).
262 2018-11-22 23:27:53 It's best to have a lot of these like coconut oil, Ceylon cinnamon, turmeric, and ginger in your food and beverages. #superfood
263 2018-11-22 23:27:53 oh believe my a sister is putting in her whole jar of coconut oil when i get home
264 2018-11-22 23:27:50 Slathered myself in the @LOCCITANE_UK almond shower oil because I’m ill and my body is feeling very dehydrated - it’s perked me right up! (And got rid of my dry skin in the process) 
265 2018-11-22 23:27:48 An ex-PM’s communist kid? Jesus, you’re an asshole. 
Do you think ANY Canadian federal government dictates the world price of oil....which is the ENTIRE problem. The gov’t doesn’t control OPEC or Wall Street.
266 2018-11-22 23:27:48 80% + rejection rate. I suspect another 19% are a result of sympathetic judges and not real persecution based on traditional enumerated reasons for asylum.
267 2018-11-22 23:27:32 The wood deck isnt really a problem but if it starts blowing rain in your oil look out.
268 2018-11-22 23:27:30 I refuse to listen to that lunatic. He lies, placates, contradicts, waffles, stumbles, condescends and pontificates about SFA. He thinks himself a grand enviro-hero where his decisions are effecting millions of Canadians in the oil sands and  beyond. He is insane. Simply bonkers.

270 2018-11-22 23:27:17 As long as it’s thawed and it’s not too much oil you’re good. Cheers!
271 2018-11-22 23:27:15 How...do you dispose of all that oil?
272 2018-11-22 23:27:08 frankincense oil has truly changed my skin wow
273 2018-11-22 23:27:07 That would mean he would have to care and we all know he doesn’t. Sinking the oil industry was the plan all along.
274 2018-11-22 23:26:55 As well as his words, the PM is a disappointment.   It’s not just AB pain.  The oil price discount negatively impacts all Canadians.  Canada’s mainstream media should be all over this.  Alberta has been abandoned by Trudeau.  @jkenney @RachelNotley @MichelleRempel @AndrewScheer
275 2018-11-22 23:26:53  - so very wrong...go ahead. stop the oil.
276 2018-11-22 23:26:53 No need to argue, the lower price of oil is not due to the Saudis or trump's 'initiatives' (the US & Russia produce abt as much oil as Saudi, our largest source of oil Canada) & while oil is down the price of gas up.
277 2018-11-22 23:26:38 YOU CHALLENGED OPEC AND YOU KNOW THEY CAN STEER UP THEM CRUDE OIL PRICES PLUS GASOLINE PRICES IN ADDITION TO VENEZUELA AND IRAN
278 2018-11-22 23:26:23 Sure he will give them one due to the oil ties
279 2018-11-22 23:26:16 No, I will not die without oil and gas. lmfao jesus, drama much? However did anyone ever survive before now. It's called progress, it's called innovation. Look it up.

283 2018-11-22 23:25:54 @mrbrit3 obviously doesn’t work in the oil and gas sector, Easy words from a small minded man...
284 2018-11-22 23:25:50 When I would have done my Marine & Offshore projects the way they handle #Brexit no ship would have sailed and no drilling rig would have ever drilled for oil.
285 2018-11-22 23:25:45 What can we expect from Wideman? Right shot D is nice. Improvement over current Oil D-men? Can’t listen to your show so I’m likely coming in too late on this discussion. @Jason_Strudwick thanks Mike from the Fights
286 2018-11-22 23:25:44 Pan of oil just caught alight nbd
287 2018-11-22 23:25:41 There is no World Class Spill response if something were to happen now with one of these oil tankers. We saw at their last drill in the Burrard Inlet, that all they have is skimmers and booms...something that doesn’t work so good in November weather, like today.
288 2018-11-22 23:25:18 And Trudeau and Motley and US Oil company funded protest groups sure make that 40 per cent cheap for our only customer.

292 2018-11-22 23:24:09 Alberta set its own table thru imprudent expansion, low royalties, low taxation and a complete lack of diversification. 

Plus, because we have a climate crisis, their long term prospects are terrible. Even if a pipeline was built, oil sands will soon become stranded assets...
293 2018-11-22 23:24:00 Sure but Libertarianism and nativism are oil and water.
294 2018-11-22 23:23:50 What country sales more oil the the U.S. than any other country? You will not get it right. Canada is the answer. I made over $40,000 this year so far on that info alone. If you only knew.
295 2018-11-22 23:23:26 Libya had a lot of factors that should have helped its outcome. Highest HDI in africa, oil wealth, lack of Sunni vs shia conflict and  minority vs majority issues. Also no Saudis vs iran proxy war.
296 2018-11-22 23:23:12 Oh, no more than they are of sending it to Scotland. But of course the Scots would say we wouldn’t have it to give, without their oil.

298 2018-11-22 23:23:04 Slumping oil prices are not helping any one in the energy sector. Keep ckoking the economy, it's about to blow. Your descion making will have serious repercussions on the economy. Simple commerce, not hard to predict!

301 2018-11-22 23:22:34 Close the Westridge Marine Terminal and stop loading boats for China of oil fetching the same crappy price the Americans are paying. These rail cars are for export on oil tankers, the same part of the Trans Mountain expansion argument that so many are saying no to.
302 2018-11-22 23:22:33 And what about the Hemp oil, that was announced as being legal? Anyway, its obvious how  stupid politicians are getting paid by big pharma lobby.CBD oils work from certain companies for various pains and  illnesses period. Due diligence.

2. We dont need their oil, but we need their assistance to combat Wahhabism and terror in Iran and Syria.
3. We make more money so I dont care about 2 dollars per tank.
4. No shit.
5. Only an idiot looks at the small picture. #shortsided
305 2018-11-22 23:22:21 Don’t fall for his hide-the-pea game. It’s about condos and loans and secrets, not oil. Canada sells USA more than 4X the oil the Saudis sell here, and T-Rump disses Canada and its leaders. He doesn’t gaf who produces oil so much as sho lined his family’s pockets.
306 2018-11-22 23:22:04 Federal debt levels are currently ~650 Bn. Trudeau has only incurred 3.4 Bn so far, which is modest. 
We have the second largest oil fans reserve on earth, plus forestry, steal and aluminum, tech etc.
307 2018-11-22 23:22:00 Most of the participants say no but one says yes. So you have focused  your article on that one because it suits your anti oil agenda. Hypocrite!!!

314 2018-11-22 23:20:27 Trump is trying to take credit for the price of oil.  What an idiot.  Just a few months ago he was bragging about the "Trump stock market, " which is now down 2% for the year.
315 2018-11-22 23:20:26 Since I’m stuck on the oil aisle waiting on a PS4.........I’ve never noticed so many types of oils....duck fat, avacado, ALGAE, flax, pumpkin seed......spicy sirarcha...the list goes on and on.
316 2018-11-22 23:20:26 Doesn’t matter what her views on the oil and gas industry are anymore.  We gave her all the resources of the Alberta Govt to keep the industry healthy and build the pipelines, but she failed.  Don’t know if anyone could have done better but the required results aren’t there.
317 2018-11-22 23:20:23 @POTUS traded a life for 11% of your oil and gas, America. Was cheaper under President Obama. Many other places to get it, too. Wonder what the next life will be worth and, more importantly, whose will it be?  Happy Thanksgiving.

331 2018-11-22 23:18:55 I have no oil investment of any kind. Global warming is a hoax. What happened to the dinosaurs? No industry then.
332 2018-11-22 23:18:39  I got some hair oil for your granny dehydrated ass puff, bye .
333 2018-11-22 23:18:35 The market price could be lower than the cost to extract oil in the US. Could it be that our country manager is more interested on importing from his partners of SA than to produce?
334 2018-11-22 23:18:30 amazing actually. when my dad was VP of on oil drilling company his office was the entire half of the (2nd to the top) floor. it never looked that good in the 80's

346 2018-11-22 23:17:50 Purchasing oil from other countries for our own use is totally unacceptable in 2018. This government has systematically destroyed years of progress in the energy.
347 2018-11-22 23:17:47 You have to put the turkey in when the oil is at 250 to avoid it bubbling over. And that drops the temperature about 50 degrees almost instantly
348 2018-11-22 23:17:37 Or what?  They’ll shut off oil?  That’s okay.  Between the US and Canada, we got it covered.

362 2018-11-22 23:15:53 A guy named Trudeau is PM and is hampering Alberta's oil and gas industry and costing people their livelihoods and billions in provincial revenues.

375 2018-11-22 23:14:56 I have good news that Mr. Trump is going to drop WTI Oil price down to $40 which will drop Fuel price for Global shipping companies. So, I will buy $TOPS at $1.10-1.15 again. I like $TOPS because she has the most Newest ships in the industry.

Oil price rollback = fare goes up


383 2018-11-22 23:14:18 Pretty sure that you don't understand how oil prices work.
384 2018-11-22 23:14:02 Your half truth about it being  part of nature completely avoids the fact that we have roughly 4x  the world population from a century ago and 12x as much CO2 today.  Follow the money for why some people deny climate change  and you'll see they work or have investments in oil!
385 2018-11-22 23:13:57 Look I’m not usually not one to list to “this homeopathic thing worked for us you should try it” BUT if you tell me this thing made your theee babies who wouldn’t sleep sleep, I’m all ears. (It isn’t like essential oil or some other MLM thing so)
386 2018-11-22 23:13:55 Alleged …. the CIA cannot confirm they did or didn't. Don't go promote something stupid and get us $4.50 a gal. for heating oil before December even gets here. Little Grandma Nellie who gets $1,500 a month in Soc. Sec. will not be happy and neither will I.

389 2018-11-22 23:13:43 Soy especialista en oil and gas pero ya me están volviendo especialista en minas y ferrocarriles. Shit happens!
390 2018-11-22 23:13:40 Economists from around the world agree, oil prices ate slumping because of reduced demand around the world. American businesses are buying up as much natural resources before January 1st when #TradeWar #tradewar sanctions kick in, then we all pay.
391 2018-11-22 23:13:34 Most business would stop selling/producing money losing product. Not Albertastan, they believe once a pipeline is built their woes will end. It will only expedite their losses, I'd any exist. Based on low oil, we pay higher gas prices than at $100 oil, square that circle.
392 2018-11-22 23:13:32 Low risk smart move. Chris is smart, good puck mover, skates well, and can defend. Put up big pts in his college and ahl days so with luck will thrive on oil if given the chance.

394 2018-11-22 23:13:26 The gov’t backed Trans Mountain over Nortern Gateway. Energy East was a simple matter of economics after TMX got the original go-ahead. I support pipelines and agree with Trudeau when he said, years ago, that no country would leave a resource like the oil sands in the ground
395 2018-11-22 23:13:25 What’s unreal is your refusal to answer for supporting and working for President Trump who is currently cheering on Saudi Arabia’s actions to hurt Alberta’s oil industry. Why is the #UCP so anti-Alberta? #ableg

398 2018-11-22 23:13:15 No he isn’t. There are several actions he could take to show our rejection of MBS and his murderous regime. Doing and saying nothing is too high a price. Our soul as a nation. We can manage oil, and Iran without them.
399 2018-11-22 23:13:10 Deuteronomy 12:17 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:
400 2018-11-22 23:12:40 And cheap oil is very much an objective of the United States.  If you knew anything at all about the world you would know this.
401 2018-11-22 23:12:34 US shale gas producers would be happy. The Saudis drove the oil price down to put them out of business. More BS and Trump compromised.
402 2018-11-22 23:12:08 We need rational policy discussions about moving #Alberta oil to tidewater.

#abpoli #cdnpoli
403 2018-11-22 23:12:06 There is just no end to his endless dribble. His far left social elite policies are the cause of oil not being able to get to new markets, He just keeps on talking I guess he thinks if he talks enough, the problems he created will go away
404 2018-11-22 23:11:49 i applied tea tree oil to my (what i think are) keloids so they better be gone tomorrow

406 2018-11-22 23:11:39 Yeah after being missing for about 4 hours the little bitch! Had to get Lynsey to come search for her as I had to go to work! Found her down the road under a parked car covered in oil 
407 2018-11-22 23:11:37 Trump's America-Last policies are shameful.

Why not thank AMERICAN oil producers for lower prices???

410 2018-11-22 23:11:00 Who wants to teach me how to change the oil in my truck? :-)
411 2018-11-22 23:10:56 If this is to say that “clean coal” and oil are viable solutions for the future then you are wrong. Disregarding the co2 emissions, these fuel sources emits nitrous gasses dangerous to human health. Don’t let our children inhale that filth. The air is not to be used as a dumpster
412 2018-11-22 23:10:54 Instead I guess he should cancel their order and allow those jobs to go to China and Russia. Also turn our relations hostile so we can pay a lot more for oil.  And, we don’t need any allies in that part of the world so might as well kiss that one good bye.  HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE?

415 2018-11-22 23:10:20 We don't even really need them. Most of our oil comes from Canada.

417 2018-11-22 23:10:10 Which you sent them in the process of buying their oil.

419 2018-11-22 23:10:06 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this November? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
420 2018-11-22 23:10:03 Just remember that your US citizens rely on the oil and gas industry too. If prices continue to drop it will no longer become profitable for the US oil companies to employ our people.

423 2018-11-22 23:09:45 Where Did I Even Keep This Oil ? 
424 2018-11-22 23:09:37 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. CBC news
425 2018-11-22 23:09:36 あとボックス6回くらい空けなきゃ
426 2018-11-22 23:09:23 You must not be so great in business with a Statement like that, Saudi Arabia is the 2nd largest producer of Oil in the World, they can cripple the market? I traded on the Mercantile Exchange and you have no clue what your taking about, #MAGA
427 2018-11-22 23:09:22 Trump decided not to criticize the Saudis for a brutal murder of an American resident in exchange for lower oil prices. It’s a terrible immoral precedent. And of course, this is only one of many examples of Trump’s unprecedented trampling on universal human rights & norms abroad.
428 2018-11-22 23:09:19 Yes, that one article in response to the eight I posted must mean you’re correct. There was a global oil glut and more jurisdictions than Alberta were affected. But your determination to make it all about Alberta is cute.
429 2018-11-22 23:09:12 Instead of it being are tanker and building a stronger Canada we will continue to let Saudi oil come in on tankers with the same possible outcome!

431 2018-11-22 23:09:04 In some ways Ontario and the Auto Sector align with Alberta and the Oil Sector, I guess we could also site The fisheries & Atlantic Canada.  Change is hard on people and that is when leadership really matters.
432 2018-11-22 23:09:04 Swap it out for magnesium oil on your feet every night. You won’t have that problem at all.
433 2018-11-22 23:08:59 What is it about Gulf Arabs taking foolishly self-destructive actions? You all know you sell the oil, not drink it, right?
434 2018-11-22 23:08:59 #andp policy to not cut spending to make up for 8B/yr oil revenue loss & invest in infrastructure helped economy recover faster. Austerity would make it much worse. GDP growth shows economy is doing well, full job recovery on horizon #abpoli
435 2018-11-22 23:08:58 Hi hope you are doing well. I wrote to you awhile ago regarding our Golden Oil Stretch Marks Massage Therapy. This treatment defies science. I am dreaming a big dream, if you could please help us in getting the word.  Much appreciated

were unsure that MBS was responsible
442 2018-11-22 23:08:28 Not in South TX, just saw $1.99 but $2.29 avg - Side note, there’s also many oil rig workers just got laid off (just in time for holidays).
443 2018-11-22 23:08:08 You know if I throw the gasoline at the burner just right it will heat up the oil quicker...
444 2018-11-22 23:08:03 Why thank Saudi Arabua?
Why not thank Anerican oil producers?
445 2018-11-22 23:08:02 "most positive economic statement or budget for the mining sector" ... unless, of course, you're mining oil, which is exactly what oil extraction is.

458 2018-11-22 23:06:32 Got one on the battery, on the engine oil pan, and the transmission oil pan on my truck. Fairbanks you know. Used to get kind of cold up there. Might be overkill for this application.
459 2018-11-22 23:06:24 Not bad.  Takes synthetic so only needs oil changed every 10,000 miles.

468 2018-11-22 23:05:54 I don't think it's either.  It's money.  He's right when he gave his little speech about the amount of money the Saudis spend on American goods, particularly arms.  And as of 2017, the Saudis also now control the larges oil refinery in the U.S.  And the list goes on.
469 2018-11-22 23:05:44 Also, by forcing oil Transport by rail it essentially landlocked grain from the prairies due to lack of capacity. (oil pays more)
470 2018-11-22 23:05:43 I hope the US military doesn't invade the backyard on the account of the oil.

477 2018-11-22 23:05:12 @realDonaldTrump as a matter of national security pipelines to canada are a MUST keystone etc. What if oil cannot be cheaply imported ? gas will skyrocket without a full connection to the oil sands. full speed ahead with oil sands national security pipelines !!
478 2018-11-22 23:05:07 His personal business will suffer if he causes problems with his financiers. He’s already pissed them off by lying Iran’s oil output to the US  would be ZERO so they produced more oil then he only partially restricted Iran, excess oil = low prices. Can’t piss them off anymore.

481 2018-11-22 23:04:41 I painted Ken Kaneki covered in blood cracking his knuckles, in rich oil colours, and my mum only went and gave it to the charity shop. Some poor old lady is going to be getting a heart attack.
482 2018-11-22 23:04:36 Trumps gobby tweet reveals he doesn't understand market economics. Minus 4,4% goods were ordered in Oct, less than expected. Economists conjecture a falling demand as cause for the oil price drop. If that's the case, the price drop could be a harbinger of a upcoming recession.

484 2018-11-22 23:04:27 Why peanut oil, specifically?
485 2018-11-22 23:04:23 Thanks, I’ll send you some oil from my backyard on my camel's back
486 2018-11-22 23:04:23 Very good. Very easy. Slightly longer cook time than oil fry
487 2018-11-22 23:04:22 Beto, What Would You Do to Saudi Arabia, If You Were President? Would You bomb Or Blockade Them? Would You Cease All Trade & Military Cooperation? Would You Stop Arms Sales? (So Russia Could Come In & Take Control Of 22% Of World'S Oil Suppy)? Cause Americans To Pay $10 a Gallon
488 2018-11-22 23:04:18 Trump pretends oil prices are going down.
489 2018-11-22 23:04:15 > If I told you an oil spill caused the die-off, would you still eat them?

There's an implication here that if you stumbled across a pond of fish carcuses that didn't die from oil you might eat them...

Brandon, no!
490 2018-11-22 23:03:57 I think constant federal intervention in Bombardier and  the auto industry is a good place to start. All we are asking is get our product to market at a fair price. Seriously, eastern Canada is buying Saudi oil. Does that seem right to you?
491 2018-11-22 23:03:53 Yes, too weak to prove it. Let the OiL prices stay LoW.
492 2018-11-22 23:03:39 The guy has refused to sit in one place for his sense cut, I’m sure as I continue to scroll down I’ll see him magmarolling with his signboard ‘oil revenue facts’ 
493 2018-11-22 23:03:27 I always forget there's a Lone Gunmen Go Ice Skating for Espionage segment in the first Black Oil storyline in Season 3 of The X-Files and honestly it's probably the only good thing about the stupid gross no fun uninteresting Black Oil. (Fight me.)
494 2018-11-22 23:03:21 And the oil too is very important

496 2018-11-22 23:02:45 The house where I grew up had eleven pecan trees & four or 5 different varieties. There was a slim pecan with a lot of oil. I would salt them & bake them.... sooooo yummy!
497 2018-11-22 23:02:42 Oil was cheaper during OBAMA ADMINISTRATION !!

499 2018-11-22 23:02:19 No poo for 2 weeks, had seborrheic dermatitis also. First used coconut/tea tree oil for scalp, now using aloe vera gel and apple cider vinegar. Boar bristle brush nightly. Scalp is clean as a whistle!! And, hair is, too. (Although I haven’t brushed it yet today ). …
500 2018-11-22 23:02:16 Is it true exxonmobil that bio fuels are reliant and abusing palm oil production and a huge contributer to the loss of rain forest destruction?
501 2018-11-22 23:02:15 I caved and popped it  i put some tea tree oil on it. I put 100% organic rosehip seed oil on my face every night and my dark spots cleared up! I scar easily on my chin and they’re basically gone now.
502 2018-11-22 23:02:15 For their meat, I know, those wild horse roundups must end, and the #BLM´s absolue BULLSHIT!!! The horses have been there before the big industries & greedy oil drilling industries came, for the native the horses were kinda holy... Like every animal was for them...
503 2018-11-22 23:02:12 What’s your opinion of oil less fryer was looking into it?  Is it really crispy? Have done deep fry for years?
504 2018-11-22 23:02:03 Muskrat Falls, oil spills, fishery mismanagement, destruction of rural areas, unemployment, debt, the latest land debacle etc - are past debate - we are systematically being destroyed by incompetents and/or corrupt persons - not in the mood for rant and roar fuzziness. #nlpoli

510 2018-11-22 23:01:26 But that’s the thing if we were not to take the sides of the Saudis then Russia and China will sells their arms and we will lose out. The sanctions against Russia is bc Russia relies on oil and the Black Sea has a lot of it too, Serbia too

527 2018-11-22 22:59:44 My mother goes through phases of healing wonders. At one point it was tea tree oil, then coconut oil, then when we had goji juice. Now it's foot soaks with Epsom salt.
528 2018-11-22 22:59:36 Also - Saudi Arabia isn't the world's largest oil producer. 
The USA is.
Russia is 2nd.
Saudi Arabia is 3rd.
529 2018-11-22 22:59:16 I wouldn’t really say that’s a good excuse more of a cowardly one, an example of a fatty food that is energy dense would be coconut oil, olive oil, nuts, avocado.

533 2018-11-22 22:59:08 Think with your BRAIN. Why do you measure it by the amount on an absolute basis. This is snake oil. If I waved a million dollars in front of someone, and said, "I'm RICH, so I'm ALWAYS right!" Do you see the flaw in that, or do you not? Am I contradicting your logic, yet?
534 2018-11-22 22:59:02 Don't agree with Trudeau on very much. But I do on this point. Why don't we have more upgraders and refineries? Because over the decades Big Oil found it cheaper to export raw product to be refined in the US. #HewersOfWood

539 2018-11-22 22:58:32 Are you absolutely out of your mind? Conservatives had people working, a surplus, no provincial tax, no carbon tax, Calgary surplus cheque’s and oil wasn’t selling for $12 per barrel.

543 2018-11-22 22:58:23 Trying hard to deflect ahh... Fact is your dictator friend killed Kashoggi... Low oil prices won't change that fact...
544 2018-11-22 22:58:17 Trump: l will not criticize the Saudis  if you lower oil prices. I will sell the very soul of America for a dollar and political advantage.
545 2018-11-22 22:58:02 With the Oilers acquiring Wideman, who is sent down to Bakersfield....or is there another deal in the works? Maybe Benning given a fresh start somewhere else?

548 2018-11-22 22:57:50 Dude.... I’m saying that now when you lie!!! Dude Saudi only provides 9% of our Oil!!!  Canada whom you constantly upset provides 40%! Try being nice to them instead!!!
Now why do you like Saudi?? Could it be they “buy apartments from, they spend 40-50 million”!
549 2018-11-22 22:57:43 Canada is post national remember we want an independent not part of Canada #ALBERTA end confederation only works to pay welfare to Quebec and Ontario with all their corporate friends get bailed out #bombardier #gm but h8 pipelines and Alberta oil suck it Canada
550 2018-11-22 22:57:35 Of course it's from Fox. Just add beard oil, and you have a contestant for the Darwin Awards.
551 2018-11-22 22:57:31 The lab doesn’t smell like oil and metal.

But.. surprisingly good! 

Constanze did not forget about the baked potatoes too!
552 2018-11-22 22:57:26 Oil consumption is increasing and #canada is shut out.   Thank you @Bill_Morneau @gmbutts @viraniarif  for your leadership
553 2018-11-22 22:57:25 We had this same issue to bought ourselves some oil radiators on the sly loool
554 2018-11-22 22:57:25 I WOULDN'T LIVE IN THAT WRETCHED PLACE FOR ALL THE OIL IN THE WORLD.
555 2018-11-22 22:57:22 #European markets close lower, #GBP holds most of its jump overnight. #Oil pulls back into the $53's 
#miniupdate #trading #FX
556 2018-11-22 22:57:22 40% of oil comes from Canada and 11% from Saudi. Doubt Trump knows that.
557 2018-11-22 22:57:21 Mines going on the bird cuz I was too lazy to rub the skin with butter.........my green beans just have onions and sesame oil on them. POST MORE PICS
558 2018-11-22 22:57:19 Per the science behind the #ParisAgreement, last month's #IPCC report, and today's UN World Meteorological Org. report, 80% of all known oil reserves need to go unused.

We need to burn less and less fossil fuel every day to leave our children a livable, governable planet.
559 2018-11-22 22:57:11 Lol that is a ridiculous statement... What population in the maritimes? Everyone leaves here to head out west, and you do realize, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and P.E.I can all easily fit into 1/4 of Alberta, right? Get a clue and get off the oil, you're doing this to yourselves.
560 2018-11-22 22:57:11 Trudeau should not only be pushing the trans mountain pipeline, he should be pushing way more for the Canada east pipeline. Why are we still dependent on Saudi oil in the east?  Crazy stupid
561 2018-11-22 22:57:09 Of course they didn’t, he controls lots of oil!
562 2018-11-22 22:57:04 Who’s the dude in the oil painting?
563 2018-11-22 22:57:02 thankful for my oil cart and the bath i’m about to take later
564 2018-11-22 22:56:54 oh worm?i'll try that next time i hav coconut oil at home.... We Can Do This 
565 2018-11-22 22:56:48 This guy has been begging me so he can change his engine oil. And I am not ready for any b*******
566 2018-11-22 22:56:40 Agree on conclusion. But that isn't how oil prices work. If Saudis, Russia and rest of Opec restrict supply, price of US and Canadian oil go up too. Global commodity. Not local pricing.
567 2018-11-22 22:56:18 20% and 8% sounds right. Half of transport oil demand is cargo (more than that in China, a bit less in RoW). Then there are two wheelers etc. Oil is 40% of fossil fuel CO2.

569 2018-11-22 22:56:04 This is the dumbest tweet ever. We go easy on saudi arabia not because of trumps condos, but because we borrow money from them (and also send us oil)
570 2018-11-22 22:55:54 You've got nothing to do with oil prices.  Geezus. Next you'll be saying it was you who came up with the day off on Thanksgiving
571 2018-11-22 22:55:49 Yes - we love to ask oil sands critics where their decommissioning and reclamation plan is for their house. Blank stare. Huh?

574 2018-11-22 22:55:21 yeah man! i wonder why the weather is so extreme?! definitely not because oil right?
575 2018-11-22 22:54:56 They en use no oil
576 2018-11-22 22:54:56 The palm oil Iceland guy really thought environmental protections would be better safeguarded outside the EU? Can’t fathom what his thought process was there. #bbcqt
577 2018-11-22 22:54:50 So, take the stuff the put in the turkey-neck, giblets, and tail. Get a good black iron skillet and a few tablespoons of oil, cook till you've got a mess. Chop up the giblets,  toss the neck and tail, add 3 tablespoons of flour,  cook till it's blended, then add milk.
578 2018-11-22 22:54:50 True. Something like 87% of US oil imports come from Canada. But its OPEC that resides on pricing. Which is why they increased production years ago when our Alberta oil sands production was increasing. Which stopped our production
579 2018-11-22 22:54:37 I forgot how much acrylics suck compared to oil paints
580 2018-11-22 22:54:37 Everyone loved Iceland last week after the palm oil ad, they’re going to be baying like wolves now the MD says he voted leave.  Hilarious

584 2018-11-22 22:54:24 Hurts my heart. Their human rights record is beyond horrible but hey they buy stuff & have lots of oil. They spend money & we dare not challenge them. What a freaking world.
585 2018-11-22 22:54:23 I left my oil pen at home, how depressing.
586 2018-11-22 22:54:19 Remember that Palm oil advert @IcelandFoods were all over the media for? Well they have decided to stop selling a lot of their Vegan stock so they can fill their shelves with even more dead animal products for Christmas. #Yum #bbcqt
587 2018-11-22 22:54:17 Not sure you would openly support the idea of an increased oil price. A similar thought process is ending with France experiencing a rebellion against rising gas prices.
588 2018-11-22 22:54:13 The new make up trend this year if Luber chiing. You just drizzle some olive oil in your eyebrows and as it smooshes down your face, the damp effect is known as luber chi.
589 2018-11-22 22:54:03 ruined me mood finding out @NutellaGlobal and @BiscoffCookies both contain palm oil 
590 2018-11-22 22:53:58 The lowering of oil prices re destroying the domestic oil industry. Think about that, Trumpers. Texas, Oklahoma, The Dakota’s. Etc.
591 2018-11-22 22:53:56 i need a oil change
592 2018-11-22 22:53:49 You’re sick Mr. President.  You don’t set oil prices.  Markets do.  You have no idea about markets.
593 2018-11-22 22:53:41 Sadly @reicurran cannot approach any subject without blaming #lpc for everything  According to her, the oil price differential is the fault of the #lpc. Nonsense of course and no one else on the panel agreed, because hey, there was a crisis when her boss was in charge too #pnpcbc
594 2018-11-22 22:53:31 Then use your billions to build sustainable renewable energy solutions instead of drilling oil you cretins. Elon Musk is, be more like Elon.
595 2018-11-22 22:53:27 Thank you for lowering oil prices

597 2018-11-22 22:53:19 The US bases in the only region that produces oil in Syria, protect the terrorists in the area who were reinforced by the ones that left Raqqa. The US killed 100 SAA while they attacked terrorists + had to withdraw from their position as IS attacked within an hour.
598 2018-11-22 22:53:18 And Canadian oil selling around 15 a barrel.
599 2018-11-22 22:53:07 Alberta oil is like an old car you love but keep sinking money into it and with your emotional attachment, you can't see it's a beater that needs to go to the wrecker. Only difference is you want to sink in tax payers money. #entitlements #cdnpoli #bitumen #tarsands #pnpcbc

602 2018-11-22 22:52:56 Trump isn't aware of any actual facts. He pulled words related to the topic: "Saudi", "oil", "lower prices", etc., and strung them together as they popped into his head. Trump is incapable of tapping into actual TRUE INFORMATION on the situation to base his comments on.

611 2018-11-22 22:51:33 Here is the dilemma, we Canadians, ponder:  If Canada supplies 4X more oil to the US then Saudis, Why Canada is the enemy and Saudis ass is kissed because oil?

613 2018-11-22 22:51:16 Please 2019,must be taken seriously by all.Oil by the day is getting outdated as the Foreign powers are gradually eliminating its uses.We are here struggling with Governance,when Rwanda,Ghana had already celebrated many years of constant electricity supply.
614 2018-11-22 22:51:10 Shame on you Rachel.  Focus in pipelines and Alberta economy. #GreyCup is a good thing, but not the important one. If I were you I would be 24/7 working in solutions to improve Alberta oil market. Next election, you will be out.

617 2018-11-22 22:50:58 My cat developed a terrible case of chin acne. I'm rubbing in rosehip oil as the last stage of her healing. It's working like a charm. High in vitamin C, I've used it on my scrapes and scars, and it works wonders if applied twice daily. Fabulous for my aging facial skin. :~)
618 2018-11-22 22:50:52 Yeah I use aveeno now and it does okay most of the year but this time of year I always have to find something stronger. I used to use coconut oil but it got everywhere and my fiance is allergic. I'm thibking maybe trying some blend with jojoba?? And then a heavy night cream
619 2018-11-22 22:50:51 If I could have it my way I would just full body dip myself in coconut oil because I always wash with too hot water and that dries me out so badly even if I use a milky soap
620 2018-11-22 22:50:41 How much of those billions of dollars have been spent to date?  They never finished paying for contracts made.during the Obama administration. With oil at sub 60 a barrel, they wont be spending billions here. You are a liar and a disgrace
621 2018-11-22 22:50:40 After reading @NaomiAKlein's Shock Doctrine, it seems clear that those who want to keep extracting wealth from the earth at literally all cost i.e. #6thMassExtinction, will use disaster & the spectre of terrorism as a tool. Assume anyone like this is an employee of big oil.

628 2018-11-22 22:50:04 The federal gov't continues to bail out the auto and airline industries, how do they think those forms of transportation are going to get from point A to B? They need our resources. I angers me that eastern Canada imports Saudi oil but thumbs their noses at our industry.
629 2018-11-22 22:49:57 I know.
It's so embarrassing for the oil sands to have been propped up for decades by Federal govt investment, subsidies and direct R & D funding.
Handouts.
Sheesh.

630 2018-11-22 22:49:56 Mr. Trump’s insistence that jobs, oil and the strategic relationship between Riyadh and Washington are all far more important than the death of a Saudi dissident who was living, and writing newspaper columns, in the United States

633 2018-11-22 22:49:44 Actually, we HAD more, until big oil interests in the states shut them down. Now they get our bitumin at a fraction of the world price and continue to see that our reserves remain landlocked and our profit remains low, low, l....

646 2018-11-22 22:48:17 I'm sick of Alberta's boom or bust oil industry wanting handouts every time the eggs in one basket breaks. Ask your foreign oil companies for handouts. Or start investing in industries that pay off and don't pollute my country. Such a sense of entitlement. #pnpcbc
647 2018-11-22 22:48:13 Those oil prices that are the same as when he took office? He is thanking them for getting back to where he started, such huge growth. What happens next month when production drops and pruces surge again? Crickets from him then I bet
648 2018-11-22 22:48:12 What's Wessen oil?

651 2018-11-22 22:47:40 The oil price differential problem is decades in the making. There was little economic incentive to ship internationally until the markets suddenly changed over the past decade. The Liberals didn’t create that problem. #PnPCBC

658 2018-11-22 22:47:00 I’ve lived in Vermont, he was my senator.

661 2018-11-22 22:46:48 Globally, oil prices are tanking. France is experimenting with increasing diesel prices.

Rural French people are protesting this. petrol costs $6.5 per gallon in France.

664 2018-11-22 22:46:20 Canada supplies 40% of US oil imports. Saudi supplies 11%. Canada could absorb that and supply 51%. Since that is not happening, the reason must be more than just oil.

680 2018-11-22 22:44:58 Scotland adopts the Euro, a hard border between England and Scotland, fishing  rights completely relinquished, no UK opt out, Scotland’s biggest trading partner (rest of UK) now subject to trade tariffs....oh and the oil price having fallen through the floor
681 2018-11-22 22:44:49 One side just has the uncle who wants to put soy sauce and chili oil on everything and no one believes in vegetables SO WHAT'S THE POINT
682 2018-11-22 22:44:45 WRONG!!  Protesters were there long before new BC gov got into office!

& I am 100% correct by saying that the Trudeau Regime never ever backed the oil industry wholeheartedly. When, since 2015, has @JustinTrudeau spoken out in favour of oil industry? He's SAID to phase it out!!
683 2018-11-22 22:44:41 U r 100% incorrect. The so call Uprising that u refer to was planed by NutYahoo & Al-Saud so they can take over his land/oil(like Golan Hight). FAKE news made ppl like u to believe he's a bad person, to justify what they started in Syria. pls go get the REAL FACTS & truth......

687 2018-11-22 22:44:24 @jfdinning Hello! #CBCTheWeekly here with @WendyMesleyCBC. We're looking to chat with you about the Alberta oil crisis. Could you give me a call? 416-205-7498. Thanks very much!
688 2018-11-22 22:44:21 @PnPCBC  Alberta has THREE pipelines running-Trans Mountain, Line3(being upgraded) & the NEVER mentioned Alberta Clipper,tripartite line,running to the Gulf refineries. The oil is low grade,which is why the price is so low. The U.S. can get much higher Q oil from it's own supply.
689 2018-11-22 22:44:19 Apparently Andy is out of the loop,  Ontario Proud troll farm is trumpeting that their leader IS the reason for cheap oil/gas.. Who knew?? :0

692 2018-11-22 22:44:01 Yeah but if you look at the climate map the rest of the world is way ABOVE AVERAGE. #GLOBALWARMING - also global warming causes climate shifts and extremes. Get a grip trump and come into reality GLOBAL WARMING is man-made and real. We need to get off  our addiction to oil
693 2018-11-22 22:43:44 Bombardier in QUE gets billions why not help out the oil patch once?????
694 2018-11-22 22:43:40 Do you see that part that says "excluding gas and oil"?
695 2018-11-22 22:43:38 THC oil works even better.
696 2018-11-22 22:43:30 You need to do some research. The oil industry received $3.3B from taxpayers last year.
697 2018-11-22 22:43:12 North Dakota and Texas are absolutely thrilled with low oil prices. That's sarcasism.
698 2018-11-22 22:43:06 Additionally most of those employed in the oil and gas and mining industries are or until recently were Labour supporters.
699 2018-11-22 22:43:06 Just put one or two drops into their eyes. Gotta hold em and they don't like it, but it doesn't sting or anything (tried it on Me first). Easy. Oh, and
another incredibly helpful tip... Rosehip oil. Great for my face, and my dog is growing hair on her (back) mange area at last!
700 2018-11-22 22:43:01 See you that stupid you didn’t do a dam thing every country gas prices dropped 1 the price of oil dropped 2 winter gas is cheaper to make as for traffic again so stupid it’s thanksgiving and one of the busiest time to travel in the year
701 2018-11-22 22:42:52 Coconut oil is just elite, it’s good for soo many things
702 2018-11-22 22:42:42 So many lies in one tweet. News is not fake. He did not push oil prices at all. gas prices are not low, but high. More people are not driving due to him. He is not sorry.
703 2018-11-22 22:42:37 That is true, but if we lost the Saudis we would lose hundreds of millions of barrels of oil.
704 2018-11-22 22:42:35 Can someone layer a non kosher pan with 3 layers of tin foil so no food touches the pan and then put veggies and oil in the tin on a stove top?
705 2018-11-22 22:42:33 and a factcheck on that - america only gets 11% of its' oil from saudis...so even in that - trump is bullshit on a stick...
706 2018-11-22 22:42:27 Truth is we were paying slightly less at the end of Obama's term & we didn't need to support murderers to get to that level. More oil comes in from Canada & they haven't murdered a journalist lately. Trump gets money & support from the Saudis so they can do no wrong. Sociopath!
707 2018-11-22 22:42:25 Ah Thanksgiving. The time of year when local fire depts across the land perform the annual Colossal Fire From Dunking a Frozen Turkey in an Overheated Overfilled Vat Of Oil Ritual, surrounded by junior field reporters/camera-men gazing with rapt attention. Behold the spectacle!
708 2018-11-22 22:42:12 @DeanNoLongerInO Changing some oil today, friend?

Now at City he's still not talented, it's all thanks to oil money. When will you guys give it up

714 2018-11-22 22:41:41 A lack of pics, but brother...the perfect roasted potatoes.  Did duck fat and butter/oil.  The partial smash is the key here
715 2018-11-22 22:41:34 no moisturizer compares to my mom's olive oil mixture where we rub an ice cube in one tsp olive oil fast for a little bit until the olive oil becomes a jammy lotion then remove the ice cube for  the best moisturizer in your life
716 2018-11-22 22:41:31 Sweet Potatoes are amazing. Add some coconut oil + sprinkle a little himalayan salt. Soooo good.
717 2018-11-22 22:41:27 Don't forget that Canadian oil is a fraction of the cost of Saudi oil and secure from terrorist attack
718 2018-11-22 22:41:25 Get a turkey deep fryer and peanut oil it will taste like chicken try it next year. Happy thanksgiving tho! #GoBlue
719 2018-11-22 22:41:23 I am 100% sure Mr Putin is a member of that organized international gang. European Union. how about oil/gas embargo ?

723 2018-11-22 22:40:59 First time I did butter and MCT oil, instructions said “slowly build up to 2 table spoons” being a man completely ignored that and put 2 spoons in  now I’m not a religious man but that day I prayed to ALL of the gods for help 
724 2018-11-22 22:40:38 What can you say about a President who cares more about the cheap oil and weapons sales , than does about millions starving to death?
725 2018-11-22 22:40:32 Ok.  Here goes.  Beautiful salad with lettuce, chopped endive, tomato, and one skellion.  Dressing is 1 tblsp olive oil, 1 tblsp apple cider vinegar, 1 tblsp mustard, 1 touch of hot sauce taste.  Then I grill a piece of salmon and put it on top.  Delicious & filling & healthy
726 2018-11-22 22:40:30 What???? No masks??? No vandalism???? Crazy right wing oil workers if Alberta isn't ALL BLUE next Oct something seriously wrong.

728 2018-11-22 22:40:22 How is it the government's fault poorly managed oil companies are losing money? Is oil socialized? How will you address the issue of cleaning up toxic orphaned wells? What is your incentive for protecting  poorly managed oil companies? Lots of jobs in renewable energy.
729 2018-11-22 22:40:20 USA prepares to add Venezuela to its terrorism list – its got a lot of oil you know
730 2018-11-22 22:40:08 but this time, don't mess it up 

A body bag is not that expensive you know, you guys have oil and all

737 2018-11-22 22:39:44 Our history with Saudi Arabia goes back to the discovery of oil in the 30's - the big $$, corporate/government, military/industrial complex rule things, and allow the degenerate Sa'ud family their continued criminality.
738 2018-11-22 22:39:44 Canada supplies 40% of our imported oil, S.Arabia? 11%  ....where you pushin? Your tweets are baseless.

740 2018-11-22 22:39:25 Maybe The Donald could offer up his kids to the Saudis and the price of oil could plummet even more....now that would help Make America Better Again......snort snort . MABA
741 2018-11-22 22:39:24 It is no joke, and obvious it is very successful war.
It is crystal clear this war with no doubt had only two targets  and both well achieved 1. Destroy these strategic countries 2. Gain profit from both the military and oil business
742 2018-11-22 22:39:14 @PnPCBC @VassyKapelos As we're continually told a CEO's only obligation is to stockholders, its difficult to believe Pourbaix is really that concerned about the cost to the country and it's people due to low oil prices.
743 2018-11-22 22:38:55 @cathmckenna c u and your govt are silent on oil leak in Newfoundland,   no surprise u r also silent on raw sewage.  That's what happens when it is all about tax money. Another liberal lie
744 2018-11-22 22:38:55 Toss the egg white in flour, then egg wash and toss in panko and then drop in hot oil for a few minutes. I got the recipe from @tasty ‘s vegetarian page. 

Japanese panko probably would have been better for a crunchier shell. But still good .
745 2018-11-22 22:38:53 @ManukaDr brightening oil smells like vomit and wet dogs 
746 2018-11-22 22:38:51 Drain your sinuses to help the virus move. Start at bridge of nose with one finger on each side (use warm oil if poss), travel round eye socket towards top of ears then straight down. You will literally feel fluid moving. Gross but highly effective 
747 2018-11-22 22:38:39 Liberal Pravda from Toronto @CBCTom says about a 1000 protestors makes @JustinTrudeau  tiptoe around oil pipeline protest #ChequesInTheMailCBC
748 2018-11-22 22:38:32 It’s not only about the oil price. Saudi Arabia ia an important ally in the Middle East.
749 2018-11-22 22:37:47 Bread is made with yeast and requires kneading, biscuits are made with baking soda ( I think) Breads don't typically have fat, some have milk, eggs or a little oil, but regular bread is flour and water.
You should know I'm not a chef or know what I'm talking about!!
750 2018-11-22 22:37:34 The reason why the price of oil in Alberta is suppressed is YOUR idiocy and that of YOUR hero the dancing Justine.

YOU DIDN'T DO A SINGLE THING FOR ALBERTA THAT'S POSITIVE!

Shoo! Shoo! Go away!!!
751 2018-11-22 22:37:30 It takes up to 50 days if I remember. If they stop sending the oil and US targets to send 3 million barrels in exports to get Brent prices, WTI should catch a bid soon.
752 2018-11-22 22:37:11 Hiya! I mash some plain firm tofu & add a little turmeric, nooch, couple of drops of sesame oil, & bit of salt & pepper. Fry it in a pan with a little bit of rapeseed oil, with a few sliced spring onions. Then add in previously boiled rice & blend well. Cook until rice is hot.
753 2018-11-22 22:37:11 I’m just thankful that the maintenance light on in my car only means I need an oil change
754 2018-11-22 22:36:44 It all starts 08/31/19 at Lucas Oil Stadium 
755 2018-11-22 22:36:39 Thank god Westminster is there to relieve Scotland of the terrible burden in being an oil rich country.
756 2018-11-22 22:36:38 If only there was some other safer more efficient way to transport that oil....
757 2018-11-22 22:36:15 I  To Drink Oil Every Damn Day.
758 2018-11-22 22:36:14 You took my advice last night and used Frankincense oil before you went to bed and.....slept. For several hours straight. Those wise men knew their essential oils.
759 2018-11-22 22:36:09 speaking as a pipeline opponent i want to ask: what do you see her doing that says she opposes the oil industry? I *WISH* I saw the opposition from her that you are claiming. Instead she's been pushing for pipeline development and expansion for years now.
760 2018-11-22 22:36:02 Oil prices went down because the US is dumpning large amounts on the market. The Saudis did not produce more oil.
761 2018-11-22 22:35:58 Price/barrel of oil is determined by the world market. Trump can put pressure, but that is all. Sounds like you already knew that.
762 2018-11-22 22:35:54 You are such the liar!!!   1...we only realized 14 billion in arms sales and the 110 billion you cited are based on non-committal "Letters of Intent" NOT REAL ORDERS / BUSINESS!!   2...The US currently produces MORE OIL than Saudi Arabia and we don't need them

766 2018-11-22 22:35:30 It’s way too transparent. We clearly see what’s going on behind the curtain’s. Those  Villa Laundry Machines trying to wash a white underwear and that old man trying to put olive oil on Manikfaan’s forehead ....... 
767 2018-11-22 22:35:28 Wideman makes more sense in Edmonton. They sorely need a puck mover and he can do just that. Not great going south — will be interesting experiment for the Oil.
768 2018-11-22 22:35:20 He doesn’t care. Only 3 seats to lose and none to win.
Trudeau does not care what happens west of Ontario, except maybe parts of BC. He will not be satisfied until oil production in Canada is zero. Gender equality and the environment are all he cares about.
769 2018-11-22 22:35:12 Living it up in Australia where as I have to tell the kids they can’t put on the heat because we have no heating oil
770 2018-11-22 22:35:12 Yeah Clive Lewis (Former VP on NUS), Trevor Phillips (Crestor of Equality Commission and Iceland man (copy and pasted Greenpeace video on palm oil and plastic banner)... your tweet is an absolute joke
771 2018-11-22 22:35:05 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this November? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
772 2018-11-22 22:34:55 Canada supports the U.S. with more oil than Saudi Arabia does. Good try though.
773 2018-11-22 22:34:51 Wideman heading to Oil country 
774 2018-11-22 22:34:49 I love that everyone's scared shitless of automated cars when people are killing each other in droves with them every day.. Like I get that we're stuck with an infrastructure built for cars cuz of big oil, but we should at least be able to put an end to collisions with automation

777 2018-11-22 22:34:38 This is a great idea!!!! What could go wrong? Leading producer of oil and terrorists gets nuclear weapons with a “promise” to never use them. I don’t see a down side.
778 2018-11-22 22:34:33 You're unbelievable!  They viciously murder an American based journalist and you thank them for low oil prices!!!!  There is absolutely no bottom for you.
779 2018-11-22 22:34:11 The trick to deep-frying anything properly is to keep the oil hot enough to cook the food through without cooling too much. If it's hot enough, the cooked surface keeps out excess oil for the remainder of the frying time. 
If it's oozing out oil afterwards, it was cooked too low.
780 2018-11-22 22:34:01 Oil Palm
781 2018-11-22 22:33:55 Update me on the oil you'll get
782 2018-11-22 22:33:40 I live in AB and I don't understand the anger. A big part of it is the product of years of anti-Liberal propaganda from Postmedia & the Byfields, & another part is oil industry boosterism from Albertans. Both are equally stupid.
783 2018-11-22 22:33:39 We urgently need to end fossil fuel consumption. Obviously this cant happen overnight but the oil companies will never take the steps needed. In the meantime, nationalize the industry so that we can consolidate the necessary environmental actions under one roof
784 2018-11-22 22:33:37 Our turkey was dropped on the ground when it was not cooked, then it was dropped into the oil and the oil went everywhere, and then it fell off of the counter. I think it’s a sign it doesn’t want to be eaten 
785 2018-11-22 22:33:30 So instead we import oil for $75/barrel and sell ours to the USA for $30/barrel because we have no pipelines to get our oil to any other world market #ThanksTrudeau 
786 2018-11-22 22:33:30 Gosh what a let down after we pushed your palm oil advert as hard as we could. Not everyone wants turkey over Christmas you know.
787 2018-11-22 22:33:30 The Saudis still have a greater impact on world oil prices than Canada does. Maybe a pipeline or two or three would help change that.
788 2018-11-22 22:33:28 I meant more like prices of shingles, roofing supplies and such..when oil prices go up so do they..or even just wuarts of motor oil..but when prices go back down these things stay higher
789 2018-11-22 22:33:19 Vaseline is my plug, but I wanna try oil this time around
790 2018-11-22 22:33:13 I have no idea why so many are upset about it lol More oil= less money cause prices would go down??? 
791 2018-11-22 22:33:13 A..no other excuses. Fried turkey in olive oil, a serving of blueberry pie (less than 7 grams of sugar and no fillers just four ingredients), red mashed potatoes (coconut based) and unlimited veggies. Still working out today!

794 2018-11-22 22:32:56 No oil?
795 2018-11-22 22:32:49 we definitely need to keep the Saudis and our relation ship due to national security and anti terrorism as well as cheep oil prices but I feel that the anti terrorism and national security aspect is much more important than just the oil
and arms deal.  president stop exaggerating
796 2018-11-22 22:32:30 The price of oil has dropped significantly. What exactly would you like the feds to do about it. Addressing crude by rail in what way. Money? For what. To transport something no one else wants?

809 2018-11-22 22:31:06 Donald is a big disappointment to Vladamir. Instead of working on trillion dollar oil contracts with Rex Tillerson, here he is at the edge of an abyss with a black hole under it. He and Vlad might've ruled at least part of this planet. Now he'll be lucky to keep Trump Tower.

813 2018-11-22 22:30:50 I'd like to think that billion dollar oil companies don't need corporate welfare. Ottawa already bought the pipeline, look how well that turned out.
814 2018-11-22 22:30:47 Mix 1 cup crab with 4 1/2 tbsps baked Alaska. Add Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve with a nice chianti.
815 2018-11-22 22:30:43 Bullshit, we all know that oil pen made Bruce take a nap. It had nothing to do with turkey.
816 2018-11-22 22:30:31 The oil industry ain't going away any time soon.

818 2018-11-22 22:30:22 Family Nutrition: Frito Lay's Cheetos this November? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
819 2018-11-22 22:30:20 Nobody is insulting you here. But you started out (perhaps deliberately) mischaracterizing an important problem in Canada and followed up with nonsensical statements about oil and gas demand and access to market.
820 2018-11-22 22:30:12 “They use the US as a shield” Yes and when we just break ties all of a sudden b/c of this there will be oil price destabilization, proxy war, trade war etc. If we end relations, we end billions invested to the nation and any alliance in Middle East.
821 2018-11-22 22:30:11 Calm down na! 

Is damatol not going to work?? 
I’m on the verge of mixing damatol with small palm oil here o 
822 2018-11-22 22:30:08 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this November? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
823 2018-11-22 22:30:03 Happy birthday sexy! @jmquiambao_ ayieee enjoy ur day kahit 'di mo ako lilibre punyeters ka yieee exempted siya math oh sana oil stay strong sainyo ni bri HAHAHA labyu!!!
824 2018-11-22 22:30:02 Didn’t seem very complicated for this prime minster to hand out millions and millions of dollars while watching million and million leave the oil industry to the states and leave the tax coffers in Alberta not to mention killing small businesses.  Sure solved the media dilemma
825 2018-11-22 22:30:01 Child Minister Nadhim Zahawi won £200000 + legal costs of £138,483 when it was reported he played a pivotal role in IS's million-dollar-a-day black market oil trade by purchasing crude oil from the militant group at a low price and selling it to markets in Israel and Europe,
826 2018-11-22 22:29:59 Its crazy how some people talk about oil as if its a negative thing. Its one of the most lucrative natural resources and creates thousands of jobs and income for Scotland. Most countries don’t have anything and we have both oil reserves and the ability to produce renewable energy
827 2018-11-22 22:29:51 Terrorists with resources we'd like to use up before our own killed another terrorist.  1000 mb connected journalists aren't worth  1000 barrels of oil.
828 2018-11-22 22:29:46 I almost burned a hole through my other arm dealing with this hot ass oil for this turkey
829 2018-11-22 22:29:44 Why dose people make a soup outta there sodmay with all that oil ur Chechess drinking hot oil Che bad 
830 2018-11-22 22:29:21 My views are pretty moderate: The status quo isn't sustainable. We need to buy, sell, and use less oil, not more. Investing in infrastructure to move more oil is incompatible with the action we need to take to prevent catastrophic climate change.

No more pipelines. Not one.
831 2018-11-22 22:28:59 Asin, but I'll use oil when Harmattan becomes serious. Till then lemme be free
832 2018-11-22 22:28:58 なな。
833 2018-11-22 22:28:51 Apparently no one checks their oil
834 2018-11-22 22:28:50 I wish you luck. It will take a new government to get the pipeline built . Trudy has no desire to help the West out he much like his father has little respect for Canadian oil, the money it  brings and the massive employment.
835 2018-11-22 22:28:49 It sure isn’t. 

An opening/ transparency to secular values & international solidarity/political pressure against all forms of human rights abuses, will help. Alas I think the US ‘look the other way’ diplomacy & our society’s addiction to oil need to change first.
836 2018-11-22 22:28:47 @CTV_PowerPlay  These 70 trains going through our town are 2.27 miles long . The 20 million dollars a day being lost for the Country amounts to $7,300.000,000.00 per year because we have no pipeline capacity to get our oil to market.Trudeau could change that tomorrow with a pen
837 2018-11-22 22:28:35 While the other one bashes oil.... Oh well.... they're kind of small town famous now....smh
838 2018-11-22 22:28:29 I am so glad Lush isn’t talked about as much anymore since people realized coconut oil isn’t good to slather all over your body
839 2018-11-22 22:28:29 It’s an Uber trade that should give the Oil a real Lyft.
840 2018-11-22 22:28:28 It would be better if Trump would support alternate energy - solar and wind - electric and hybrid cars- rather than support the oil industry and make America enslaved to the Saudi because of his love of oil.
841 2018-11-22 22:28:26 Men’s shampoo be like 13-in-1 shampoo, condition, body wash, dish soap, car oil, cooking spray, coffee creamer...
842 2018-11-22 22:27:52 The price of oil would skyrocket if Saudi Arabia decided to cut production. Ready for 6 dollar gas?
843 2018-11-22 22:27:25 I only apply oil where you can see
844 2018-11-22 22:27:20 Now playing I Need Your Oil by E. Dewey Smith, Jr. & The House of Hope Atlanta!
845 2018-11-22 22:27:10 If governments stopped subsidizing big oil and status quo fossil fuel energy infrastructure and began investing in & prioritizing clean tech (like clean storage) we might get there sooner rather than decades too late according to all climate reports.
846 2018-11-22 22:27:02 $100 OFF Mechanical, 50% OFF R&B, up to $30 OFF Oil Changes, and MORE! Don't miss out on these Black Friday (and Saturday) offers!
847 2018-11-22 22:26:59 Are pipelines in the interest of public good? Oil pipelines are a danger to land values, wildlife, and pose a serious health risk to human populations. This is why judges are not apt to be granting the construction of pipelines.
848 2018-11-22 22:26:58 Does it include illegal palm oil and dead orang-utans?
849 2018-11-22 22:26:37 I’m knocked out how many Dems/ liberals are buying into Michael Avenatti as a political savior. We’ve seen what damage a political novice who’s in love w/ his own image & publicity will do. Avenatti is another snake oil salesman. Don’t buy into his bullshit.
850 2018-11-22 22:26:34 Over-reliance on oil. Sanctions
851 2018-11-22 22:26:31 @BobbyClobber007
Alas, the AB oil sector is in crisis. Capitalism predictably emits yet another massive boom&bust fart.
852 2018-11-22 22:26:26 そもそも2連休は毎週来るのが普通なのでは？
853 2018-11-22 22:26:16 we definitely need to keep the Saudis and our relation ship due to national security and anti terrorism as well as cheep oil prices but I feel that the anti terrorism and national security aspect is much more important than just the oil
854 2018-11-22 22:26:11 Hot oil treatment or not,  I can't be mad at #PostMalone- he represented us blue eyed- soul guys very well @AMAS #AMAS2018

856 2018-11-22 22:26:02 Roast cauliflower is really nice. I wrap it in foil. Or I’ve done a delicious roast curried cauliflower with oil & dry spices.
857 2018-11-22 22:25:46 That's why the price of oil is cheaper. You're pressuring #SaudiArabia to pump more because in order to make up for the oil that you prevented #Iran from exporting due to your imposed sanctions on #Iran. You are price fixer for oil.
858 2018-11-22 22:25:41 今日行けば2連休だし耐久するしかない
859 2018-11-22 22:25:29 1)Unfortunately also hurting US oil @US_OGA ; #USA now world largest #oil producer by country. 2)Doubt #Saudis happy, their budget deficit already 7% of GDP before oil drop, worse than USA. 3)But drop mostly caused by #IranSanctions waviers, so #Iran is less worried. #wti #brent
860 2018-11-22 22:25:27 Add postal workers in with oil workers to those who say, shut it down it's a dying industry, has the naysayers thought of how we feed and house these people? #pnpcbc

864 2018-11-22 22:25:09 Deut 28
7. The Lord will grant that the enemies who rise up against you will be defeated before u. They will come at u from 1 direction but flee from u in 7.

Psalm 23
5. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.
865 2018-11-22 22:25:06 Same here. My go to dirty food is packet noodles that cost 59p from the Chinese supermarket with Lee Kum chilli oil all over it
866 2018-11-22 22:25:05 Bush n Saudi King the rest of them greedy oil people made enough money for that one time period to ruin everything. I remember gal of milk 5.00 gal of gas 5.00 loaf of bread 5.00 n Bush n greedy bunch did to everyone in America. Why greed they wanted more. It just wasn’t enough.
867 2018-11-22 22:24:49 Whales.... they're nasty customers, let me tell you... not good people. Not many people know this, but they're filled with whale oil! Tremendous whale oil, it's good stuff
868 2018-11-22 22:24:49 You don't have to make up numbers, you know.

The US citizenship and immigration services, part of homeland security, publishes these numbers. 

Did you mean BP as in BP oil btw?
869 2018-11-22 22:24:36 Turkey is at about 131F. Will soon uncover it to let it brown. Sprayed olive oil on it before I put it in the oven.
870 2018-11-22 22:24:27 You truly don’t understand economics. If Saudi slows production, the price of ALL oil rises regardless of who we buy from. Reprehensible that we don’t pressure Saudis on murder but it will impact oil price.  #sticktosports
871 2018-11-22 22:24:22 We don't need their oil.  That will hurt them worse if we quit buying it.
872 2018-11-22 22:24:16 I’m impressed that he got Canada’s oil & gas prices lowered, too. What’re the chances his golden toilet & cell mic are hooked up to Exxon?
873 2018-11-22 22:24:15 You know "Big Oil" pays for almost all of that stuff, right? Not taxpayers. Lol
874 2018-11-22 22:24:15 states that Julie of Washington has too many lesbians working the midnight oil and @margaretbrennan and @jdickerson and @gayleking and @duncan and still the key and salient point is that Julie is not a hooker but a volleyball player who believes that Golden Key mocks everything

876 2018-11-22 22:23:54 I would make the 40% rate start at £50,000, 45% at £75,000, £85,000 p.a. for 60% marginal rate increasing in steps up to rate of 80% at £1m p.a. and 90% at 10m p.a.

I raise min. wage to£11/hr, lower VAT to 15% but I would raise/lower fuel duty inversely with the oil price.
877 2018-11-22 22:23:52 Charlie Yur getting carried away! RBS Scotland’s National bank was bailed out of the basement by British tax payers , no? AAA my my arse!  Oil! Oil! Oil!  All  this is speculation, as Nicola Sturgeons Oil revenues forecasts  have shown, no ? She wanted grading on education ? D-?
878 2018-11-22 22:23:40 Canada have more oil than USA and yet they are second to Saudis on reserve and exports. USA buys our "dirty oil" half price. What's wrong with this picture?
879 2018-11-22 22:23:35 stuff that's made me cry recently 
- missed my cat 
- shoelace came undone
- poured gin all over my room instead of lavender oil my accident
- couldn't find my seminar room today 
- changed gears on my bike without peddling and it went all clunky and scary 
- couldn't open soup
880 2018-11-22 22:23:20 Oil is gone, our children want their future to be fossil fuel free!
881 2018-11-22 22:23:11 You wish
882 2018-11-22 22:23:00 The Saudi Arabian royals are getting away with murder. Once again if you have oil you can murder and get away with it. They have already murdered any one who comes up with a better ENERGY SOURCE
883 2018-11-22 22:23:00 Our great City of #CHESTER is well on its way to becoming the UK’s 1st plastic free City and 1st palm oil free city.. I wonder whether we could become the first rough sleeper free City too? Could faith & vol groups come together to take everyone off the streets even without SWEP?
884 2018-11-22 22:22:56 Furthermore, ideology does not cause collapse. Economical systems cause states to collapse. Venezuela failed due to their corrupted governance when they decided to limit oil output(their most valuable resource). Socialism has very little to do with their collapsing market.
885 2018-11-22 22:22:55 Is there an oldey-time energy source that Trump doesn't just love? I bet he'd go bananas if you told him people used to use whale oil for lamps.

891 2018-11-22 22:22:12 Oil price is controlled by SA though, despite where it's imported from.

894 2018-11-22 22:21:43 How about to pass control of oil market to US, guarantor of global economic stability?
895 2018-11-22 22:21:35 No olive oil?
896 2018-11-22 22:21:33 Roast it in biggish chunks with plenty of salt, pepper, lemon juice and olive oil; you’ll be happy. Sumac or whatever if you’re feeling fancy.
897 2018-11-22 22:21:33 Dumbass Ryan. Trump has not denied climate change but the notion that it’s the fault of humans. There have been warming and freezing temps for millions of years before the use of oil products.
898 2018-11-22 22:21:31 @PnPCBC Re: Alberta's oil disaster. The industry brought this on itself. Had they built oil refineries when needed years ago, they wouldn't be stuck with bitumen no one wants to pay for and pipelines wouldn't be as controversial as they are. And then there was Harper. #cdnpoli
899 2018-11-22 22:21:15 Nice to see you are as uninformed as you were about US history, keep talking out your ass son it's going to make sense one day. You don't think there is nothing wrong about oil and fossil fuel companies continuing to contribute to 71% of global emissions without getting punished?
900 2018-11-22 22:21:10 As a Gulf War Vet I would rather see a criminal leader charged and punished for his crimes than pay less for gas at the pump.  The Saudi Crown Prince ordered a murder and Trump should not cut deals on oil prices to support the lies.  He is if anything an accessory in this crime.
901 2018-11-22 22:20:53 RECIPE
Take rice and dal 2:1 and wash 2 times in running water
Leave to soak
Make basic masala base with oil, jeera, chopped onions and potato, red chilly powder, turmeric and salt
Add ingredients in that order with 5-10 sec gap up to potato, then keep stirring for 1 min ...
902 2018-11-22 22:20:51 Right. Give us lower-priced oil, and we’ll let you get away with murder. Not sure I want them having our weapons. BTW, we could buy oil from Canada.

907 2018-11-22 22:19:58 They can pass this but can’t get a pipeline built. Pathetic. Nobody cares about Canada Post / we have $80 M/day in lost Oil revenue. WAKE THE HELL UP CANADA!
908 2018-11-22 22:19:57 We subsidize your oil if you subsidize our MF electricity.

911 2018-11-22 22:19:12 THEORY: Dawn caused the BP Oil spill just so that they could market their soap with cleaning off animals #conspiracytheories
912 2018-11-22 22:19:09 Dafuk you spoutin’ off about now, Fat Shitler?  Lower gas prices are due to more oil in the market.  Supply and demand, Econ 101...read a book.
913 2018-11-22 22:19:08 Won't lower crude oil prices lead to a larger trade deficit with the Saudi government?
914 2018-11-22 22:19:03 Oui pour la très grande majorité des mots. Mais il y avait aussi l'influence latine pure et l'influence de l'oïl du nord (dont le picard, français-parisien médiéval et normand) qui avaient aussi des S sonores. La signification c'est "latin" = donc officiel avec le S d'origine
915 2018-11-22 22:19:00 Foreign oil is product of the free market system, Canadian oil is heavily subsidized by the taxpayer.

918 2018-11-22 22:18:25 Connect the dots. The US refineries that are off line have coking facilities for mined bitumen. Will there be a demand after IMO 2020? who knows. Pumped oil being refined in Alberta is looking good. Interesting, eh?
919 2018-11-22 22:18:24 I nominate the NRA and big oil - they caused the most deaths.
920 2018-11-22 22:18:22 11% of our oil comes from there, and could easily come from somewhere else. WTF is he talking about?
921 2018-11-22 22:18:22 Strangely enough, thank US Oil Producers, now the #1 producer of oil in the World. Oil is a world commodity. If we continue to increase production and nobody else decreases, prices will continue its downward trend. Saudi Arabia has done zero to lower the price of oil! @FoxNews
922 2018-11-22 22:18:15 Yeah, I’ve heard the elder Trudeau blamed for the recession in the 80s, which, oddly enough, was a damned oil crash. Straight up nothing to do with the NEB or the feds, just cheap oil. People love to blame governments for things that have no relationship.
923 2018-11-22 22:18:10 You mean drop oil prices to $15/barrel? Or raise to $150/barrel? Either way, the global demand for oil isn't going to support such a dramatic price adjustment. SA also ramped up production to account for the sanctions against Iran, but Trump's dumbassery caused that to backfire.
924 2018-11-22 22:18:02 So when is the O POINT ENERGY FREED?! WE DONT WANT OR NEED OIL! THEFT OF FIRST NATIONS LAND!? VIOLATION OF TREATY? ISNT THAT A GOVERNMENT CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT?

931 2018-11-22 22:17:29 My cat jumped right onto my oil painting great
932 2018-11-22 22:17:27 I'd love to compromise, but pipeline advocates want nothing less than free rein. More pipelines, more oil sold, and none of it taxed proportionately to the harm it does. 

We can't afford that anymore. So please, do suggest a compromise. 

Until then, no more pipelines. Not one.
933 2018-11-22 22:17:04 “We are all paying for FSHS in some ways “. Who should pay? government? How do government get their monies? Obviously it’s our tax and oil funds that’s how it’s done everywhere it’s free because you don’t use your disposable income to pay.
934 2018-11-22 22:16:58 It's crazy how I'm about to go Black Friday shopping, when I should be on my way to a hotel in Indy to play at Lucas oil tomorrow.. thank you ihssa refs
935 2018-11-22 22:16:57 my contribution today was stuffed mushrooms and Brie, rosemary ham and olive oil crostinis and they were bomb.
936 2018-11-22 22:16:49 Balance?  How do you balance a premeditated murder with the price of oil?   We do need to worry about the balance of power in the ME but we give too much power to SA while ignoring their atrocities.  Where's the balance?
937 2018-11-22 22:16:45 @CTV_PowerPlay We do not have any more rail capacity for moving oil by rail. Today in our Alberta town there are up to 70 trains running though our town, either east with oil and  grain or west with empty cars to be filled with oil, grain. and other products; a train every 10 min

940 2018-11-22 22:16:23 AKSJSK OMG ty ily :((( and literally I just use this exfoliating face scrub that’s coconut oil w/sea salt!
941 2018-11-22 22:16:21 There is only so much capacity.  A few years ago farmers couldn't get their grain to market because oil tanker cars were priority.  Now you want even more rail cars for oil?
942 2018-11-22 22:16:20 明日は週末明日は週末明日は週末明日は週末…
943 2018-11-22 22:16:12 Common sense would have told you president Bush was going to raise the gasoline prices because he was making money off the oil prices. Oil prices went to 100 dollars a barrel and there was no reason for it other than our government doing it to us and that’s exactly what Bush did
944 2018-11-22 22:16:11 With your face looking puff puff that they left in oil for too long...
945 2018-11-22 22:16:08 Try castor oil, hair oil, but federal law enforcement.
946 2018-11-22 22:15:52 勤労感謝の日にブラックフライデーとか労働とブラックは切っても切れない関係なんだね
947 2018-11-22 22:15:48 Jenny you miss the point, Trump is more 'honest' on his lack of action against KSA unlike his predecessor and WMD.. Moore did excellent critique about oil etc etc and Bush said WMD and than regime change
948 2018-11-22 22:15:44 Even if you want to make a roux, pretty sure you can use oil instead of butter. Never tried it, but can’t see why it wouldn’t work.
949 2018-11-22 22:15:44 Can someone get me a fucking oil refill in Jersey?! SHIT! Wtf!
950 2018-11-22 22:15:42 It mean if America is only imported 9% of oil from Saudi and 40% from Canada that America benefit more from Canadian oil then saudi's

953 2018-11-22 22:15:35 You being President has cost America integrity, a position of democratic world leadership, a national debt level combined with an environmental clean up bill that will take America decades to pay.
Trump family will make $$$ from international sources and big oil for decades.

956 2018-11-22 22:15:19 Agree, but between 0 and 2% is much more likely for the mineral oil effect, as explained by Harvard Med School prof Deepak Bhatt in his video Live from AHA on YouTube
957 2018-11-22 22:15:04 I remember reading an article about the tar sands dating back to the early 20th century. It was well known then that the price of oil had to be over $100/barrel before it even came close to being profitable. Some conman really took the industry to the cleaners.
958 2018-11-22 22:15:03 More important to Unionists and Westminster. They'd miss our oil money.
959 2018-11-22 22:15:01 Gonna get colder if you run our oil companies out if business with low oil prices
960 2018-11-22 22:14:57 Boycott @IcelandFoods not palm oil this Christmas.
961 2018-11-22 22:14:42 And what will happen to BC coastal waters when an oil spill happens? It won’t be Alberta’s economy that will destroyed.
962 2018-11-22 22:14:40 “no oil or butter.” 
963 2018-11-22 22:14:38 ダダ漏れさんw
964 2018-11-22 22:14:36 We could make a start by not doing any more arms for oil deals.

We could pull out of all the countries we’ve currently invaded.
965 2018-11-22 22:14:30 It was, and I'm not, and I'd have hoped for more from you, but whatever. Trudeau killed Gateway; there's ample discussion about what killed Energy East (Quebec? Trudeau regs? Collapse in oil prices? Notley yanking the take-or-pay subsidy?); a lot of things have delayed TMX.
966 2018-11-22 22:14:30 Hating Alberta oil? I hate ignorance. Ill planned and initiated oil extraction with no local refining process. No consultation, respect or reliability or responsibility long before jeopardizing BC life,water, jobs and return respect.
967 2018-11-22 22:14:08 His dad is an oil and gas tycoon and honorable.

968 2018-11-22 22:13:56 Worst. oil. ever.
969 2018-11-22 22:13:50 The Indian Government has said President Donald Trump's international destabilizing effects with a Trade War, Sanctions, Muslim Travel Ban etc leading to currency depreciation and high oil prices in India
970 2018-11-22 22:13:43 I do twists outs now, so I use Aunt Jackie’s Curl-la-la on my strands. Sometimes I use a leave-in I got from Earth Elements. For my scalp I use Mango and Lime oil with the felt tip. I put very little and just rub my scalp for a good 10 secs or less. I’m very lazy with my hair.
971 2018-11-22 22:13:33 My dad uncle and I trading oil pens. Orange daiquiri the best
972 2018-11-22 22:13:29 Oh I must’ve missed it. Shea butter/coconut oil can clog your pores and break you out
973 2018-11-22 22:13:19 Good point. The Niger Delta conflicts, not to mention the Middle East with Saddam's Kuwait invasion, GW2. Oil wealth funded ISIS.
974 2018-11-22 22:13:17 @realDonaldTrump hey just want to remind you that when you took office oil was $52 now $54 Still can’t match Obama
975 2018-11-22 22:13:12 Oil and Israel are behind Trump's support of MBS on Khashoggi's murder
976 2018-11-22 22:13:00 I made Mac and cheese and stuffing last night with weed infused coconut oil and then ate 3/4 of both things and woke up at noon today. Happy thanksgiving!
977 2018-11-22 22:12:57 warning signs large current deficits in the US &UK that were being financed by the excess savings of emerging economies and oil exporters, loose monetary policy the search for yield and misperception of risk; and lax financial regulation. Sounds just like trump policy 
978 2018-11-22 22:12:35 Do you really think that everyone is as stupid as your cult members? Not one job is added because of what Saudi Arabia is buying. I thought you said that we were totally independent of oil and that the US produces enough oil for ourselves. You are a con man and a coward in chief
979 2018-11-22 22:12:25 America has lost all respect and the moral upper hand thanks to a charlatan and snake oil salesman.
980 2018-11-22 22:11:45 #Khodorkovsky Act is truthful name. Names the criminal former oligarch behind the bill. Wants 'his' Russian oil industry back so he can sell it off to the West.
981 2018-11-22 22:11:42 Will do. Burner always off when manipulating bird or oil or similar.
982 2018-11-22 22:11:40 Saudi Arabia's share of oil production is well beyond the spare production capacity of either US or Canada. 

We are at our limits, and that’s why removing Saudi Arabia from the equation ‘could’ be catastrophic
983 2018-11-22 22:11:30 See Trump is trying to trade his ok of the killing of a journalist,for lower oil prices
984 2018-11-22 22:11:28 President Bush raped the Americans when he was president. The Americans should have knew he was going to do that. Considering he was a big oil man. Let that be a lesson to all Americans. Never vote another president in office if he is connected to any oil business
985 2018-11-22 22:11:21 I like beets roasted in oven w/root vegs tossed in olive oil salt rosemary, lil dash of red wine vinegar. I don't really like beets pickled or in sweet dishes. They taste too "earthy" for me to pair w/syrupy sauces. I'm sure recipe will make someone very happy to know so TFS
986 2018-11-22 22:11:17 How much does it cost to truck and rail freight oil across Canada? How much fuel do they burn what’s the cost of the tires they use the rail car maintenance the truck maintenance the list goes on, and the argument is that that’s a better way than a pipeline?

992 2018-11-22 22:10:35 its 2 small cans of chopped black olives, 1 can green chiles, ~1 cup chopped green onions, can of chopped tomatoes, 1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup olive oil, packet of ranch dressing powder. its  good but like i said idk why its called salsa its more like an olive dip
993 2018-11-22 22:10:26 It’s amazing how good Vietnamese chiles in oil mixed with butter can make a turkey.

995 2018-11-22 22:10:11 RT @LivingSafely: Frito Lay's #Cheetos this November? Its top three ingredients are corn meal, vegetable oil and cheese seasoning.
996 2018-11-22 22:10:07 Hey Nero, maybe tax back a little of that to prep the US infrastructure and economy for the sea level rise that results from artificially depressed oil prices?  America can’t be ‘great’ if it’s broke and under water.  #globalwarming
997 2018-11-22 22:10:06 I laud the goal, I really do. But it’s just counter productive. Blockade Parliament, MPs surgeries, oil company offices - take it out on those with power, not the benighted person in the street. Of course if we weren’t spending all our time on sodding Brexit...

1002 2018-11-22 22:09:41 You thought COLA and oil caused the 70s inflation .
1003 2018-11-22 22:09:40 That pieces is a hate cons opinion piece. No different than irrational anti-lib pieces you see now. The facts are we need to get our oil East for Cdn’s & west for world markets. Today we’re selling at $13.44, not $59. Hating pipelines, politicians or me won’t solve that.
1004 2018-11-22 22:09:36 Yeah, because when did burning a trillion barrels of oil, a trillion tons of coal and a trillion cubic metres of gas into a wafer thin atmosphere ever effect anything... #headmeetsdesk
1005 2018-11-22 22:09:31 I’m literally the same way. So what I do is use a very light, liquidy oil and apply like once a week. But I make sure my strands are moisturized. I don’t use much product.
1006 2018-11-22 22:09:14 Oh God le tout puissant,
we need more Oil and a good Blessing for all of us and for our beautifull planet the Earth. Ameen أمين
1007 2018-11-22 22:09:12 Don't throw holiday cooking oil down the drain. Check with your city or town for pickup/recycling options.
1008 2018-11-22 22:09:11 @VassyKapelos Asl OIL CEO if production cuts will mean layoffs in the industry.
1009 2018-11-22 22:09:10 O problema é não poder  peitar nenhum dos dois..USA tem déficit na balança comercial com China 50bi mesmo valor do superávit nosso..Já Arábia tem Oil e Trump quer ele barato. já nos queremos ele nas alturas por royalties e Petrobrás...moral? melhor e ficar encima do muro
1010 2018-11-22 22:09:10 Turning on ALL the essential oil diffusers in this household in an attempt to curb the inevitable neuroticism that plagues our family gatherings #ThankfulForLavender
1011 2018-11-22 22:09:08 It doesn’t really matter if they can be trusted or not, does it?  The current administration would favour Jack the Ripper if he owned oil.
1012 2018-11-22 22:09:01 What do the Cowboys' defenders have on their hands- oil? Where's the QB seeking missile- Vander Esch when McCoy takes off running?
1013 2018-11-22 22:08:56 Venezuela failed to work when the government enforced price controls and subsidies on the economy. When oil prices dropped there was no longer money for subsidies but price controls remained (for fairness!). No one would produce below cost. (How evil!) Remove the govt controls
1014 2018-11-22 22:08:46 For whatever reason , oil and gas prices don’t coincide. Canada sells oil to the States for around 20 dollars a barrel !!
1015 2018-11-22 22:08:37 Really, you have no idea how important oil is and what we use it for...vehicles are a mere fraction of what intricate little details for humans to move around in life...do more research  and i think you'll delete your post...
1016 2018-11-22 22:08:33 @ABDanielleSmith @CBCEyeopener #Liberal Trudeau’s family money comes from **GAS** stations around Montreal known as the Automobile Owners Association that he sold to Champlain Oil Products for $1 million in 1932.  His grandfather Joeseph Charles-Émile Trudeau.
1017 2018-11-22 22:08:20 OPEC sets the oil prices.
Not you. Not your ties to murderers. Not your ego inflated self importance of making everything about you.

Come January, we will ALL see just how much you're owned by the Saudi's.
Better yet, you could just resign and flee to Russia.

1018 2018-11-22 22:08:19 I like sunflower coconut and olive oil and toasted sesame 
1019 2018-11-22 22:08:11 Since there is strong evidence that they funded the World Trade Center attacks. What do you think is best for this country? They have now lowered the price of oil to help us swallow the fact that the royal family was involved in a murder.
1020 2018-11-22 22:08:08 If oil prices rise can they be punished then?
1021 2018-11-22 22:08:04 I really hate oil on my scalp .... I sweat in my head so it’s a big issue for me
1022 2018-11-22 22:07:56 Light years ahead, WHERE? You've done nothing, 0. Do u watch this sport?
We're not "rebuilding" we have changed a position. U know, as Cgy did! I guess by ur standards u're on a rebuild too
No matter how bad oil got they still out sell Cgy. Thx god for 3000+ oil fans at BOA
1023 2018-11-22 22:07:36 I run synthetic blend 10W-30, from Certified Labs,  in all my equipment, gas or diesel. It's a great oil that I've had the best luck with. We extend change intervals +50% and have oil analysis done randomly. Never an issue. It works for our climate, year round.
1024 2018-11-22 22:06:58 Can mine be fried in oil that fish and chips have not been please?
1025 2018-11-22 22:06:53 Glad I changed oil, damn 2500 miles in Richmond is like 5000 miles in Danville
1026 2018-11-22 22:06:53 Prices were up because opec was not releasing oil. When Pompeo went to visit MBS something was discussed, probably about the murder, and the saudis released more oil dropping the price per barrel. So basically because trump is MBS’ bitch.
1027 2018-11-22 22:06:43 Any of y’all have keloids, scars, cuts, or damaged scar tissue from tattoos, piercings, fights, sex lol whatever the hell it may be. Get Trader Joe’s Tea Tree Oil... . Heals in days.
1028 2018-11-22 22:06:41 Yes and it’s all down to oil and money ... but state has diplomatic relations that constrain even if that is a pathetic excuse ... the @ICGPnews do not have to do this they choose to
1029 2018-11-22 22:06:38 The issue is, it’s this sort of smug, intellectualised-left showing off that will keep us out of power. I’ve worked on building sites, oil rigs, power stations... these are the people we need to vote Labour. We won’t win anyone round with this student union bar bollocks.
1030 2018-11-22 22:06:30 US gets 40% of its oil from Canada. The Saudis only provide 11% of US oil & literally hold our country hostage for this pittance by cutting millions of barrels from production then jacking prices. Oh and they kill journalists too.
1031 2018-11-22 22:06:30 It seems everyone is talking about palm oil, plastic and saving the orangutans (which is great) but little is being said about the biggest contributor to these collective environmental issues....animal agriculture #eatmoreplants #ditchdairy

1037 2018-11-22 22:06:07 Huh? Oil is traded on an exchange. You did nothing
1038 2018-11-22 22:06:05 Let’s see hearing oil drop. It’s ridiculously high. Ridiculously! $3.00/gallon.
1039 2018-11-22 22:05:57 Does her sweatshirt say "Low Class Oil Trash"?

1041 2018-11-22 22:05:33 I am sure CBC is all over people demonstrating against Justin's treatment of the oil and gas industry in Calgary today.
1042 2018-11-22 22:05:32 Obviously oil is not a fossil fuel.

1046 2018-11-22 22:05:12 #pnpcbc - the #Liberals are just going thru the motions when it comes yo helping the oil patch -why not build pipelines and refineries in the East and in Alberta.
1047 2018-11-22 22:05:10 I love the physics of turkey frying. The oil level actually drops as you cook, because the bird loses moisture.
1048 2018-11-22 22:05:06 The planet is going to overheat and the water is going to be gone. This the beginning of migrant movement. Water is the new oil.

1054 2018-11-22 22:04:16 You might be right there.  I know their was vote splitting but still she got elected in Alberta.  No small feat, and who knows how well she could have been if the oil collapse didn't happen.  Kinda reminds of Obama, smart guy but inherited 2 wars and a major recession.
1055 2018-11-22 22:03:43 Inside he giggling like a 10 year old girl. His agenda was to kill oil and gas and especially Alberta which he hates. And because our elections are so unfair and one sided because of eastern Canada's population we are going to have him again as Prime Minister.

You tell me!
1069 2018-11-22 22:01:54 It’s the most moist turkey ever. I fried in peanut oil for about 15 years and changed to infrared about 5 years ago to save $ on oil. I inject with about a quart of a butter/garlic mix.
1070 2018-11-22 22:01:46 Greenpeace isn’t advocating a boycott - they’re advocating that companies drop the suppliers responsible for forest destruction such as Wilmar. As it says in the Q&A, palm oil is potentially a very sustainable product!
1071 2018-11-22 22:01:22 EXPLANATION 2
Poha or pre-boiled beaten/flat rice is virtually pre-cooked. You can soak Poha in water and make a quick shallow pan masala base with oil, jeera, onions, potato, red chilly powder, turmeric, salt and just add Poha to the mix and stir a bit and eat!

1073 2018-11-22 22:01:02 My very first lesson in investing came during the Norway oil boom of the early 1980s. My then boss warned me: "Vikings raped and pillaged many people around the world. Don't think anything has changed, just because they're called 'Norwegians' today." 
1074 2018-11-22 22:00:55 Philosophy Purity line. It's the only thing that doesn't make my skin angry. Tea tree, definitely. Palmer's coconut body oil that I mix essential oils into. Argan oil too....

Yep.
1075 2018-11-22 22:00:54 Nope, even then?  Hot Oil >>>>>>>>
1076 2018-11-22 22:00:45 And also on this topic, is it correct to state that oil is a security of the biggest oil company in the world because that company uses it? Or the internet is a security of Facebook, Amazon and Google? I am really really interested in your view. Thank you.
1077 2018-11-22 22:00:42 I'll pick up the pace after I'm done with boiling oil.

1086 2018-11-22 21:59:55 The only thing I want ppl to get me for Christmas is more paint supplies... easels, acrylic/oil paints, brushes or gift card to hobby lobby and micheals 
1087 2018-11-22 21:59:46 No, there is only a finite anount of oil in the Earth so even if there were no extraction costs it would still cost more than zero.
1088 2018-11-22 21:59:41 bout to buy a flea comb just to scrape paint out of my oil paintbrushes
1089 2018-11-22 21:59:11 You did that didn't you?
Omnipresent powerful one. 
And you control oil prices. And the judiciary branch. And dictated that there will be 12 eggs in a dozen. And the cycles of the moon. And Whitaker. And Mueller. No, wait, not Mueller. But everything else in your twisted universe
1090 2018-11-22 21:59:10 There once was a Saudi prince pass from a Pres. with blood oil up his ass backing murder for hire lit his sheik’s thobe on fire in a filthy rich case of crude cash.
1091 2018-11-22 21:58:51 Abia, Anambra and Imo has oil. They are also part of oil producing states. Pls get ur facts wella biko 
1092 2018-11-22 21:58:51 It’s because you took me on a trip to change your oil when we were in J-school and that’s my reference point 
1093 2018-11-22 21:58:50 I love the silk cream and cleansing oil!! The lip balm seems a little extra but why not 
1094 2018-11-22 21:58:49 Press a button to start it.a small gesture y oil u can hide
1095 2018-11-22 21:58:44 No palm oil, thanks!!! Eat it yourself.
1096 2018-11-22 21:58:33 Mango dripped in oil 
1097 2018-11-22 21:58:33 What low oil prices? I just paid $3.02 per gallon for regular gas.
1098 2018-11-22 21:58:30 And why is it we can't use Canadian oil for our gas?
1099 2018-11-22 21:58:30 The baby oil 
1100 2018-11-22 21:58:29 Trying really hard not to medicate with these headaches in an attempt to understand the cause... but man, an advil looks pretty good right now,

Any remedies you use? I'm drinking more water, less coffee, peppermint essential oil, warm/cold compress, less screen time at home.
1101 2018-11-22 21:58:17 Do you REALIZE that SO MANY Albertan's are out of work relating to OIL, which we have an ABUNDANCE of, but that this Government is choosing to buy oil from Saudi Arabia rather than use WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE resulting IN ALL THESE OUT OF WORK PEOPLE? Do you even GET IT???
1102 2018-11-22 21:58:09 All you need is the fire in the old oil drum and you pull a string and he sings “there are 2 kinds of love that you ought to know, there are 2 kinds of love .......”
1103 2018-11-22 21:58:08 Oh we have them here, never liked them.   my idea of instant food, sardines, preferably in olive oil.
1104 2018-11-22 21:58:07 Alberta and the oil patch are in the middle of an existential crisis, largely of his making, and @JustinTrudeau arrives in #yyc today with platitudes. The man is beyond pathetic. #abpoli #cdnpoli
1105 2018-11-22 21:58:06 Gas should be a lot lower with the price of oil right now IMO....
1106 2018-11-22 21:58:03 EXPLANATION 1
Sunflower/Soyabean oil has higher smoke point than any other oil and is cheaper. High smoke point means less chance of burning oil. But coconut oil is tastiest imo. Use coconut to make food and if you want to fry, use soyabean.
1107 2018-11-22 21:58:03 Unless he can figure out how to get oil to put out rainbow smoke that attracts unicorns, the world price of oil is going to be what determines our prices. As long as Saudi Arabia is keeping them low to suck up to the village idiot south of the border, our prices will be low too.
1108 2018-11-22 21:57:59 I have been painting in oil paints for more than 10 yrs
1109 2018-11-22 21:57:57 So you’re going to tell me what it’s like to live in a red state with an economy that sinks with oil prices? You’re going to school the economists noting the early signs of slowdown & predicting a 2020 recession? No thanks.
1110 2018-11-22 21:57:56 She stuffed up water now here comes the environment...hmm shades of Tina Joemat and we all know how she ended..magically disappearing a huge bunch of oil reserves.  Effing cANCer.
1111 2018-11-22 21:57:45 Yes! That drives me crazy as well. Just as i don't take seriously anyone that says "Tar Sands" instead of "Oil Sands"
1112 2018-11-22 21:57:40 Who will invest in antiquated tech, oil is done.
1113 2018-11-22 21:57:21 I'm making an oven roasted chicken slathered in olive oil and rich seasonings. I'm grossed out because it's a dead animal body, but it makes him happy to eat some protein on Thanksgiving.
1114 2018-11-22 21:57:21 My uncle deep fried a turkey with peanut oil and said don’t come over if you have “ allergies” lol boi 
1115 2018-11-22 21:57:17 Dope head forced out of his job. Snake oil peddler. A sucker's born every minute.

1117 2018-11-22 21:57:06 Please ChairBoots, please can I join too? PJs are the best thing ever (just not necessarily when greeting the oil man!)
1118 2018-11-22 21:57:04 Poor oil companies. Seriously?
1119 2018-11-22 21:56:59 Are we going to see the large pro oil rally in Calgary today, or is CBC going to cover for the groper?
1120 2018-11-22 21:56:43 Weed oil in the coffeee before T-Giving dinna wasn’t the worst call... 
1121 2018-11-22 21:56:28 @JustinTrudeau just get us off oil. Start by no bitumen in pipelines. And give Real Incentives so the Average  can purchase Hybrid or Electric vehicles. Then Design/Build/Own  Hybrid and Electric @PMcanadien @CanadianPM
1122 2018-11-22 21:56:25 The lushest 
1123 2018-11-22 21:56:12 The kingdom of heaven runs on good intentions. Those on earth run on oil.
1124 2018-11-22 21:56:11 Always about the oil.
1125 2018-11-22 21:56:09 Saudi Arabia contributes to only 11% of America’s oil.  Canada provides us 40% and Texas and Gulf Coast the remainder.  There is a glut of oil and that is making prices go down.  Not you Donald.  Not you.
1126 2018-11-22 21:56:06 Could it be that he has no intention to fix the problem. He wants all Canadian oil gone. No pipelines, no wells, no oil sands. Nothing, except gender equality, everyone in Indian costumes and to spend billions of dollars the country does not have.
Go Home!
1127 2018-11-22 21:56:05 Were not as dependent on their oil as we were in the 70s. And you think that is what caused the housing collapse??
1128 2018-11-22 21:56:03 I put apple cider oil in my humidifier and it just made my whole house smell like the holidays 
1129 2018-11-22 21:55:57 I do agree as well, diversification is smart. And we have many of the raw materials in Alberta to build an economy that supports Alternate Energy sources.  Hopefully a second oil market can bring up the economy and earnings can be then focused on investing in new energy sources.
1130 2018-11-22 21:55:36 Why can I knock over a #sleek x #takaomiyake tube and nothing happen...but drop a sherbet pencil dabber an inch from the oil slick and it breaks into a million pieces¿?¿
1131 2018-11-22 21:55:21 Instead of funding all these daft wars on oil in the Middle East and sacrificing young soldiers shouldn’t we just fire all that money into the #nhs instead #ambulance
1132 2018-11-22 21:55:13 My grandma has been healing everyone with CBD oil today
1133 2018-11-22 21:55:09 Low Oil Level
1134 2018-11-22 21:55:07 You are horrible! We get most our oil from CANADA! DUH!
1135 2018-11-22 21:55:06 Frankly, every US president of the last fifty years has blood on his hands because of Saudi Arabia. We should have cut them loose decades ago. The reason we didn't can be summed up in three letters: OIL.
1136 2018-11-22 21:55:00 So, they are all phoney ? And how do know that?
1137 2018-11-22 21:54:56 1. oil cylinder thoroughly
2. insert piston in cylinder
3. get covered in oil as it gets spat out of the ports.

1138 2018-11-22 21:54:51 Whisk egg yolk with a tablespoon of olive oil and leave on hair for a few minutes before your shampoo. It makes a great hair conditioner.
1139 2018-11-22 21:54:48 Denmark leads with action. Canada leads with nice socks & hair & follows the oil & money no matter what.
1140 2018-11-22 21:54:48 Scotland's oil, fish, whisky, renewables...
1141 2018-11-22 21:54:44 Can I ask, how did the UK cover the RBS debt ? ...BOE, but based on “printing money” backed by tradable assets/exports etc ie Oil/Gas etc...I assume Indy Scotland would have these assets ? S&P forecast that Indy Scotland would be AAA rated due to this but RUK would be down graded
1142 2018-11-22 21:54:44 Had a Chinese earlier and it was sensational. But now a feel like there’s a litre eh oil in ma stomach and a feel ill
1143 2018-11-22 21:54:36 You also never met someone that changed his own oil,framed a house or sharpened a chainsaw
1144 2018-11-22 21:54:34 The man in the shadows The big oil man  
1145 2018-11-22 21:54:32 Putting coconut oil under my eyes is as annoying as useful it is .. i can’t seeeeee
1146 2018-11-22 21:54:24 It’s not the oil, it’s the bribes.
1147 2018-11-22 21:54:22 Look up "HIGH VOLTAGE OIL FLIES INTO MY ASSHOLE"
1148 2018-11-22 21:54:15 Yeah the price of oil is enough to sell your soul
1149 2018-11-22 21:54:11 The TFW program was devised to assist Canadian oil companies when having  difficulty locating essential services.
1150 2018-11-22 21:54:09 I like Avene Eau thermale cleansing bar for my face, it’s got a lovely subtle fragrance.I also am using an olive oil soap that I got in a health shop in Inverness. I like Faith in Nature soap too.
1151 2018-11-22 21:54:04 I lived there for five years and so experienced five Thanksgivings. It's... boring. The best one I attended, we deep-fried a turkey in the driveway a drum full of boiling oil. #dangermakesitfun
1152 2018-11-22 21:54:00 
1153 2018-11-22 21:53:51 Yep! Hope we all can eat money and drink oil.
1154 2018-11-22 21:53:48 Has anyone else noticed Iceland are putting on all their adds “no palm oil” YAAASSS
1155 2018-11-22 21:53:47 Like, I can barely stand these people when I'm high.  I need more vape oil, please?  Send so I can go tomorrow and replace what I use up today.  I need to not beat people with their shoes.  My rewards are always worth serving. #weedslave #420domme
1156 2018-11-22 21:53:37 Seven year old cousin just told me not to use palm oil because it’s killing her kind (monkeys/apes)  bless her 
1157 2018-11-22 21:53:35 Most wars over the lad 60 years or more have always been about oil, gas , centralised banks to further the globalist agenda.Problem for the globalist's and puppets is we are wise to it.
1158 2018-11-22 21:53:21 Balanced opinion their Ruth. With North Lincolnshire being amongst the UK's most impoverished counties. Lets hope this aids North Lincs communities and shuts up the hypocrits who have thrived on oil based products all their life, now expecting future generations to go without.
1159 2018-11-22 21:52:57 Yeah folks apparently just take the turkey straight from the freezer and dunk it in a vat of boiling oil which leads to the ultimate tryptophan: death
1160 2018-11-22 21:52:38 Liar the Saudis paid you in money and lower oil prices to keep you from doing anything to the Crown Prince you're the first president in history that's bought and paid for enough money and you'll let them commit murder

1162 2018-11-22 21:52:28 Considering you get most of your oil from my Canada. The world knows what your doing. You owe Saudi Arabia for your own personal debt and again you hide behind America. Would someone LOCK this Pathetic Old Man up....Please and thank you 
1163 2018-11-22 21:52:27 Hey if someone blew up Calgary who would sit around and watch oil prices plummet?
1164 2018-11-22 21:52:16 We all know Canada supplies four times the amount of oil to the US than Saudi Arabia.
Please understand, trump does not read and fox ‘news’ won’t tell him.
1165 2018-11-22 21:51:58 Yes, the price of crude oil is lower. The effect on the small independent oil producer is devastating. You can reduce subsidies to farmers and let oil prices come up and reach the same goals.
1166 2018-11-22 21:51:53 monoi oil
1167 2018-11-22 21:51:52 I hope the person who came up with the idea that putting oil in your boiling pasta helps in any way is burning in hell right now
1168 2018-11-22 21:51:42 Who wants do weedsgiving next year. Any food that take butter or oil takes it with a green twist
1169 2018-11-22 21:51:26 Interesting to see the 'Free from Palm Oil' continue on Iceland's new (middle of the road) xmas ads now everyone is talking.
Personally - I think a positive step to help those who hate being told "they can't do things anymore" understand a BIG issue
1170 2018-11-22 21:51:18 Yes, I love them with olive oil, and some sautéed garlic and golden crisp onions tossed in. Yum!
1171 2018-11-22 21:51:01 I agree Tina - one day we will have tech that displaces oil. Next 50 years will be fun!
1172 2018-11-22 21:50:47 Bulletproof coffee is pretty solid in the morning. Good balance of caffeine and healthy fats/oils. Regular coffee (I use Stumptown), Ghee butter, and MCT oil. Blend together and pour. Comes out nice and frothy
1173 2018-11-22 21:50:47 Buying Saudi oil costs - we pay them billions for oil - it helps ruin our balance of payments - we must pay to correct - and for the ignorant - it suppressed our domestic production- keeps prices below what it costs to drill and process into gas - so Saudis Win - trump’s buddies

1177 2018-11-22 21:50:35 For me, I realized if I'm adding weight, I do not reduce my ration. 

I simply substitute foods. 

Foods high in Carbohydrates and Fats & Oil are mostly responsible for weight gain (Basic science I believe).

So I substitute a amount to of my Carbs with Fruits. 

Works for me.
1178 2018-11-22 21:50:32 Twitter’s most influential social media personality @realDonaldTrump said “ Thanks Saudis for low gas price “ As a moderate Republican membership I would like to reply “ I am thankful for the STUPID ECONOMY in USA during last 2 yrs. Without thousands oil drilling riggs reopen  ..
1179 2018-11-22 21:50:24 I thought that after thinking over the ad, people kept talking about how great Iceland are environmentally and I was just thinking sure except for all of the butter / lard they’ll be replacing the palm oil with!
1180 2018-11-22 21:50:07 *My liquids spill all over the TL* That was motor oil that came out of me you dirty people. eue
1181 2018-11-22 21:50:06 @DonMartinCTV Hey Don, how funny are the ongoing Oil and Gas sector setbacks for hard working Albertans?? Based on your relentless smirking and giggling like a school girl when reporting on the dire circumstances in the patch, pretty funny to you sitting down east, jackass!
1182 2018-11-22 21:49:58 1. The increase in pipeline capacity in the US, increase of production and the exporting of oil began way before Trump.  Back when Obama was still POTUS
1183 2018-11-22 21:49:56 Yes, Canada does supply most oil, but would you rather change your personal usage of oil and possibly enter a war with the Saudis or act nice towards them?

1190 2018-11-22 21:49:02 1.  j'ai pensé un moment que le peak oil nous sauverait du réchauffement climatique mais il reste bien assez de fossiles pour que ce ne soit pas le cas. Si nous nous appauvrissons nous utiliserons les techniques les plus dégueulasses pour l'extraire.
1191 2018-11-22 21:49:00 Castor oil is great for stretch marks. Apply it daily for 4 weeks to see noticeable changes.
1192 2018-11-22 21:48:51 You are a child.   Do you think this is just about oil?  It’s about Iranian and Russian hegemony in the ME.   Grow up.
1193 2018-11-22 21:48:49 actually such a yawn watching people get outraged over folk who want to stop using palm oil products this Christmas instead of going completely meat free. jingle bell ur life up and maybe appreciate that folk are starting to be more aware of ethical consumer choices.
1194 2018-11-22 21:48:46 Do you remember when the prince of Saudi Arabia was in an oil argument with the countries beneath his realm yeah oil prices went up a lot
1195 2018-11-22 21:48:46 ラッキーの大物感
1196 2018-11-22 21:48:44 Honestly I think boycotting palm oil is probably less complicated than buying sustainable only on a purely personal level but reading more about it I’m not sure it really makes sense environmentally at all.
1197 2018-11-22 21:48:41 @realDonaldTrump traded justice for the murder of a human being for cheaper oil. That's the most GOP thing he's done.

1201 2018-11-22 21:48:18 I understand that right wingers would deny #ClimateChange if they’ve a vested interest (oil or auto industry) but I don’t know why RW media would take that position.  Is it pure pack mentality?
1202 2018-11-22 21:48:07 A world-famous trusted consumer advocate told America that there was no difference between an environmentalist and an oil company executive.  I blame the person who sold that lie.
1203 2018-11-22 21:48:06 Alberta should of diversified along time ago given how the province is a boom or bust province, the cost of oil has been down since 2014, Trump and SA are in together to keep it low, its a bad time for everyone
1204 2018-11-22 21:47:49 But at most, i use oil, salt & pepper usually.. not a ton either.. and sometimes i’m feeling worcestershire sauce
1205 2018-11-22 21:47:40 That is #oil. Not ola! I am bespreking this #Myanmar tale and what the nos and abstentianites hope to attain! Ghastly creatures! These huge gaping mouths with nothing to say!!!
1206 2018-11-22 21:47:35 If we only had our own source of oil?????
1207 2018-11-22 21:47:35 We don't need to destroy everything we have to find oil either. If we do one day we won't have a country. I for one would make Saudi pay more for refining their oil. That way to keep ours down.
1208 2018-11-22 21:47:32 They have replaced mine without asking- I made them put the old one back in.  Be clear up front- nothing but oil change..
1209 2018-11-22 21:47:32 Google who we get the most oil from jackhole. Don't ever sit on a jury. It requires critical thinking.
1210 2018-11-22 21:47:03 It’s the sound of mostly water bubbling vs. the sound of tiny bits of water trapped under oil suddenly getting enough energy to vaporize and burst up and out. That’s the sizzle and snap you hear when searing in fat or when you add a little water to fat.
1211 2018-11-22 21:47:00 It’s interesting that they don’t mention any sustainable options. I’m also slightly unsure of their position with regards to Iceland given that the butter / lard they’re replacing the palm oil with is surely basically as bad environmentally?

To achieve super soft, health, shiny hair, it’s very important to moisturizer your hair with water and seal it with an oil to lock in that moisture. brittle hair at bay.
1220 2018-11-22 21:46:30 Records show GHWB being born in Massachusetts in 1924, enlisting in the Navy in 1942 post H.S graduation, then venturing into the oil business after the Navy and becoming a millionaire at 40 in '64. Only then entering politics in '66. 

You do weave a cool story, its total BS tho
1221 2018-11-22 21:46:22 Oil talks and bull walks.
1222 2018-11-22 21:46:21 Probably the best thing would be if the oil majors started rapidly diversifying into renewables and CCS
1223 2018-11-22 21:46:15 @Honda Oil dilution in the 1.5 turbo CR-V is very real. Mine has never been in cold, but the oil is diluted and reeks of gasoline. A fix is needed in EVERY state! #HondaCRV #NHTSA #Recalls #oildilution

1226 2018-11-22 21:45:55 Come on, lets face facts. Trudeau hates Alberta and wants to kill the oil sands industry. He hates the military, so will starve it.  He hates conservative provinces, so will ignore them. He hates Trump, so will denigrate the US.  This is the most divisive, most arrogant PM ever
1227 2018-11-22 21:45:52 My mom just spilt turkey oil all in the oven and smoked the house out and nearly set us up in flames and basically we are the Griswolds during the holidays. Things go comically wrong.
1228 2018-11-22 21:45:51 All this "biggest spill in NL history" talk has drawn me to the fascinating story of the Odyssey, which sank on the way to Come by Chance, spilling 650 times more oil than White Rose. It was a bigger spill than ExxonValdez and we NEVER talk about it.

1232 2018-11-22 21:45:38 We didn't give a shit about Saddam killing his people. We coveted Iraq's oil.
1233 2018-11-22 21:45:38 Wouldn't worry. A country that cannot manufacture an oil refinery 80 years after discovering vast reserves beneath its soil will never manage to refine uranium. After 30-40 years, once the oil reserves dwindle they'll go back to herding camels...

1240 2018-11-22 21:45:09 It's always ironic to me when you see the free market zealots come out of the wood work to blame the government for not propping up the dying oil industry enough. We just spent over $4bn to buy a pipeline valued at $550m, what more do you want?
1241 2018-11-22 21:45:06 Short sell #POL if crude oil keeps falling. Go long in #NRL and #ATRL.
Watch #PSO for short sell opportunity but aviod going long until debt certainities are settled.

I saw someone who looked almost like you today in Spie(an oil & gas servicing company in PH). We were coincidentally collecting cheques from the cashier. Our talk was brief though. But What really got me attracted to her was the fact that she's a Business Lady.

1248 2018-11-22 21:44:19 They aren't asking for the PM to fix the oil problem.  Just help getting a fix. Oil to a new market would help reduce the discount that the US is driving. Helping our economy.  The oil market with the US has changed recently with them increasing production and exporting now.

Yes - they are ensuring that our domestic production is held down -
1251 2018-11-22 21:43:40 The king of Saudi Arabia lowered down the price of oil. Why do you think he did that because this president Donald Trump let his son get away with  Mellering a American journalist who was also from Saudi Arabia . What is this country coming to when the  President  .

1275 2018-11-22 21:41:12 I'm addicted. Just cut them in half, lag in olive oil, salt and pepper and do them for about 30 mins at 180 fan/200. Eat them as they are/with stuff/also good tossed through pasta with parmesan, bacon and lots of pepper.

1280 2018-11-22 21:40:46 @POTUS  forced Saudis 2 drop oil prices. went from $80+ 2 $50. In Australia petrol was $1.70 going 2 $2 a litre after oil price drop $1.30 saving $30+ per tank full. @chriskkenny  thank you @POTUS

I grew up in an America that (I thought) lived up to the highest moral code.

In retrospect, I realize that many of our ambitions & actions weren't always altruistic; however, I would never have expected a US president to openly support a murderer for lower oil $.

1337 2018-11-22 21:34:06 I live in a border town in Western Canada. We cross border for gas. It’s cheaper in the States. We are paying $5.20 a gallon here. I would love your prices. Sad thing is we ship the oil to Washington who refined it and ships it back. The barrel of oil drops but not at the pump

1340 2018-11-22 21:33:44 Don't vote NDP in a oil resource province !! It's that simple..And never vote for an ex prime minister s communist kid !!! It's that simple ...Lose these 2 job killers and we are back in business...It's that simple..
1341 2018-11-22 21:33:43 It's not about the environment? All this time that was bullshit and it's really been a "don't give the mean oil guys what they want because I don't like having social programs and two of them fucked my wife" vendetta? I get it. I'd be mad if roughnecks stovepiped my wife, too 
1342 2018-11-22 21:33:37 The worst part of deep frying food is waiting for the oil to get hot.
1343 2018-11-22 21:33:29 I had plain white rice with gnut oil and pepper
1344 2018-11-22 21:33:26 Hahaha the lady’s shirt... “low class oil trash”. I just peed a little. 
1345 2018-11-22 21:33:22 I love when ruffnecks try to hit me up, and talk to me like I don’t know anything about oil field. NEXT.

1347 2018-11-22 21:33:20 This story is about the Oil and Gas company's cold reception of the PM today in Calgary for not helping them in yesterday's fiscal announcements. CTV comes to the rescue attempting to discredit the industry.  The PM's media bribe is already paying dividends.
1348 2018-11-22 21:33:20 With all due respect Mr President, you have no bearing on the price of oil any more than any other president. Fuel efficient cars and trucks are creating a surplus of oil and the countries that produce it, have not altered their production levels.
1349 2018-11-22 21:33:16 My family fried three turkeys. I’m screaming another is dropping in the oil.
1350 2018-11-22 21:33:14 It’s not that easy. That takes time and the prices would still increase. Oil is a limited resource, the only way prices wouldn’t increase is if they became more effiecient thru technological process.
1351 2018-11-22 21:33:10 Its pretty obvious that Trump and Saudia Arabia have an 'understanding' between themselves about keeping oil prices down
1352 2018-11-22 21:33:03 New neoliberal strategy for fixing climate change:

1357 2018-11-22 21:32:51 It's actually a world market but unless Saudi Arabia convinces several other oil producers to cut production, the effect will be minimal.
1358 2018-11-22 21:32:46 Last week Alberta @RachelNotley @albertaNDP  voted down @Alberta_UCP @jkenney motion to fight Bill C69. Rachel talks a big talk but her actions speak for her real intentions for this province which are 'no pipelines & no oil & gas'.
1359 2018-11-22 21:32:38 Dear @realDonaldTrump:
Canada provides the US with 364% of the oil that Saudi Arabia does.
Canadian terrorists did not attack us on 9/11.
Canadians did not murder the father of 3 Americans & dismember him on the orders of MBS.
Thank Canada. Don't grovel to Saudi Arabia.

1371 2018-11-22 21:31:36 POTUS: “Feel free to kill anyone you want Crown Prince. As long as you buy our weapons and keep oil cheap.”
 When you said “America’s open for business!” I didn’t realize you actually meant “for sale”
1372 2018-11-22 21:31:12 Heard of oil pulling? The latest craze in oral care, which involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth, has many proponents. However, the ADA notes that there have been no scientific studies to prove its benefits. Consult a dentist for all your dental hygiene questions.
1373 2018-11-22 21:31:01 Missing the point. It’s about petro dollars. When everyone in the world has to buy oil in dollars it allows our economy to be enriched by reinvestment.  Still doesn’t make what happened correct. But the importance isn’t their oil but the currency they sell it in.
1374 2018-11-22 21:30:51 The Saudis keep the Muslim world on a tight lease for Us and the rest of the world. We buy their oil and sell them fighter jets. They keep the Muslims from being way worse than they are.
1375 2018-11-22 21:30:44 Since a fair chunk of that oil goes down to wash state refineries, now would be a good time to increase pipeline tolls.
1376 2018-11-22 21:30:37 Many oil producing countries have devalued their currency and are very happy with current prices. In rouble, oil is still near all time high. They are very interested in expanding their market share. Cartels are anyway illegal.

1381 2018-11-22 21:30:17 So you are going to sell-out morals and ethics so that the one percent can make more on selling war material of the morally corrupt Saudis, just so the one percent that sells oil products in the US can gain even more?  You are so corrupt, but in your mind you think that's OK!

1416 2018-11-22 21:25:54 This is due to OPEC putting an oil embargo on The US and several European countries including the UK and OPEC cutting supply of oil. Hence resulted in a oil shortage and price to shoot up causing inflation to shoot up too.

America is 40% of our total oil supply.

Trump screwing up the economy will have everything to do with it.

Canada is our largest importer at 40%.

1443 2018-11-22 21:23:10 Oil is a commodity that deserves a status as a national security item. Should OPEC ever shut the flow, the east will start feeling the cold. Ottawa has to ensure the Canadian resource is protected and flows in all directions.

1463 2018-11-22 21:20:42 He still has almost half of the country behind him buying his snake oil salesman pitch for whatever they believe he’s going to give or get for them in the end. I also don’t believe in his perceived intellect, but instinctually, he’s hella on point with unearthing his sycophants!
1464 2018-11-22 21:20:39 CRX, surely! The Metro's oil light came on after a few minutes driving and could only risk it once a week for the run from Gloucester to Wycombe. According to the DVLA, it died for good in '99.
1465 2018-11-22 21:20:32 Thanks shale oil boom, thanks OPEC, we's all goan die.
1466 2018-11-22 21:20:18 Came to my dad's house for Thanksgiving and he changed my oil , filled my gas tank, and cleaned/washed my truck. I'm thankful for that lol
1467 2018-11-22 21:20:11 태왕계유,,,결혼해..
1468 2018-11-22 21:20:06 Let them kill some more and have the oil prices even lower.
1469 2018-11-22 21:20:00 Party leaders are gonna talk about this house party quicker than they talked about the 250,000l oil spill
1470 2018-11-22 21:19:46 I made a mixture ye coconut oil, conditioner namanzi in a spray bottle then a curl defining custard to wake the curls up once in a while and that's it
1471 2018-11-22 21:19:43 Today I am thankful for my oil pen and edibles to keep me somewhat sane.
1472 2018-11-22 21:19:42 Climate change will impact their coastal properties before they ever accept the reality of climate change. The revolution will be against oil n carbon fuels and that win will take care of their investments which are based on destruction of the planet. Prepare for the crash.
1473 2018-11-22 21:19:38 What are your thought on truffle oil in green beans?
1474 2018-11-22 21:19:21 America is your leader and Saudi Arabia can not survive with the lowering oil price
1475 2018-11-22 21:19:20 Nope, the oil kings!
1476 2018-11-22 21:19:19 my great aunt brought cbd oil to thanksgiving and my dad is lecturing everyone about passive listening devices
1477 2018-11-22 21:19:18 Spray rose water on your face and when it dries, massage one drop of rose hip oil. I promise your skin will thank you.
1478 2018-11-22 21:19:06 Could it be that this goof of a PM actually realizes that this country depends on oil 
1479 2018-11-22 21:19:02 I'm thankful a murderous dictator is selling enough oil to keep gas prices low.
1480 2018-11-22 21:19:01 What Trump doesn't tell you is that he caused oil prices to rise because of his threat to end the Iran Nuclear agreement. He drove up prices, now that the prices has come down he's a "hero". Total BS.
1481 2018-11-22 21:18:57 お、いる…ッッ(パタリ
1482 2018-11-22 21:18:50 South Sudan suffered under Sudan. One would think nations such as South Sudan that have suffered wars & genocide would come out stronger, committed & focused. The interactable dispute between Pres. Kirr & his deputy is all about power & control of the new found oil wealth
1483 2018-11-22 21:18:50 The dawn dish soap commercial where they clean the animals from oil spills etc is making me feel soft
1484 2018-11-22 21:18:39 LRT: i dont understand how we’ve somehow constructed this narrative that people who work in the oil industry are low class.
1485 2018-11-22 21:18:25 #Canada has plenty of oil. We just need to use our own and stop supporting foreign countries while we sell #Canadial oil at a discount.
1486 2018-11-22 21:18:19 I need an oil change bad 
1487 2018-11-22 21:18:01 Or boosting competitiveness. Let’s saddle Canadian companies with higher taxes and regulations while stopping pipelines and destroying the oil sector while simultaneously piling on debt that will be future tax increases. Isn’t that a recipe for Venezuela?
1488 2018-11-22 21:17:57 [At the dinner table]

Stephen: So what is it again?

Amber: I'm telling you, if coconut oil comes from coconuts, and olive oil comes from olives, then that means baby oi-

Tony: Can't we just hAVE ONE FUCKING DINNER? ONE FUCKING DINNER
1489 2018-11-22 21:17:53 BREAKING NEWS: After a long process fighting liquidation, FC Bispalona will be remaining with current Arab oil tycoon Prevan Nayanah Rajh
1490 2018-11-22 21:17:52 @SachinNayak1607 burning the midnight oil, wondering about chips, suggesting P&B extensions, having his way with words after having an at length elated P&B M experience = wow
1491 2018-11-22 21:17:49 To get oil to eastern  & reduce imports from SA, I’d say that’d be priority 1; if it wasn’t canceled outright already. TMX still has a mandate & will help offset $100mil/day of oil discounts to  by getting us to world market. I’d go TMX 1st at this point. We need them all.
1492 2018-11-22 21:17:34 And if you add quinoa oil and almond milk, it'll be even worse.
1493 2018-11-22 21:17:32 @AskHershey I love your chocolates and especially Reeses, but I really don’t think you should use palm oil that destroys rainforests and takes orangutang’s homes away, leaving them with nowhere to live. I really hope you’ll take into account what you are doing.
1494 2018-11-22 21:17:32 Totally craving a salad with acai and non-GMO coconut oil.

1498 2018-11-22 21:17:20 Masoud Barzani held a fake referendum to win Kirkuk's oil & extend his power monopoly, & the consequences were catastrophic, & now in the name of correcting the past mistakes plots shakes hands w/ the same ppl he considered them enemies a yr ago. He can't represent the Kurds.
1499 2018-11-22 21:17:12 I find when I take oil, I get the pasties alot. mouth so dry.
1500 2018-11-22 21:17:03 Just finished changing my oil and installed the gear actuator so its a good thanksgiving
1501 2018-11-22 21:17:02 Beard oil
1502 2018-11-22 21:17:01 I’ve never made my sweet potatoes with marshmallows because they are already sweet I’ve never understood this concept I make mine with salt, pepper, old bay, and olive oil and it’s the perfect mix of sweet and savory and it’s always a hit?
1503 2018-11-22 21:16:59 Can you put a bit more oil on that please
1504 2018-11-22 21:16:47 IoT? B**ch please, I prefer Oil and gas.
1505 2018-11-22 21:16:40 US Closing prices: #DOW -0.00% #NASDAQ -0.00% #Ftse100 -1.28% #GBPUSD 1.2876 #EURGBP 0.8855 #EURUSD 1.1401 #Gold -0.01% #Oil -1.37%
1506 2018-11-22 21:16:26 He got sold a lemon because political necessity forced it. And the oil price is a fallacy. Oil companies invest on the producing life of the well, which covers several booms and busts. Interest rates low, way cheaper services now, and easy to get capital. Why has Texas boomed?
1507 2018-11-22 21:16:20 I see you @OswinBenjamin with that olive oil....
1508 2018-11-22 21:16:07 Thank you for the idea dear Juliet!! I like brussles spours ("prokulice") cooked with olive oil or as a salad!!
1509 2018-11-22 21:15:54 Vitamin e oil!!!
1510 2018-11-22 21:15:45 Seconding LiveClean!! I have oily hair and use the apple kind, but I know they have others that are more moisturizing (argon oil etc)
1511 2018-11-22 21:15:18 Sooo.... Is Yemen literally a case of blood for oil? This whole partnership makes me uneasy.
1512 2018-11-22 21:15:09 haha it’s just a cheapie oil pen that looks really sweet
1513 2018-11-22 21:15:07 Aw man it didn't even occur to me to buy more oil during all my grocery runs. Why does every recipe use so much!! Am I seriously gonna be eating like half a bottle of oil
1514 2018-11-22 21:15:03 I made his mama some essential oil roller balls with floral  scents I hope she likes along with a few diffuser bracelets 
1515 2018-11-22 21:14:51 Oh yes, Trevor Phillips certainly is a Tory in his views and ideology. Pure establishment.   Richard Walker is a supporter of Greenpeace and therefore palatable for a corporate, and needs praise for what he has done re promoting Greenpeace's work on the palm oil campaign.
1516 2018-11-22 21:14:48 You do know that SA is running out of oil don’t you???
1517 2018-11-22 21:14:48 Closing down the border as we near shutting down government over the funding of wall as mini ice age envelopes North America due to Sun entering 400yr Grand Solar Minimum cycle that will require massive increase in natural gas & heating oil production Learn from History.
1518 2018-11-22 21:14:37 But our President will keep selling weapons to the Saudis for this genocide because “oil $$.” Truly despicable.
1519 2018-11-22 21:14:36 surprise! 6 different types of cheese in your macaroni does not serve as seasoning. half of yall macaroni visually appetizing and taste like oil.
1520 2018-11-22 21:14:30 BRENT OIL IS DOWN AT 62!!!! Happy Thanksgiving! #Oil
1521 2018-11-22 21:14:21 looks like it was just dipped in the oil.
1522 2018-11-22 21:14:07 Western Canadian refineries have very little deep conversion, meaning they can’t earn proper returns processing heavy oil (Husky does for asphalt and NWR will soon but for diesel). While lighter and conventional prices are discounted by bottlenecks, it’s less than bitumen.
1523 2018-11-22 21:14:03 Yes it is true. Go look it up our oil is selling for that price
1524 2018-11-22 21:13:58 Trudeau, like all thinking Canadians across the country, knows the importance of the Alberta economy to Albertans and to the rest of Canada. He can't wave a magic wand and raise the price of oil.  But he has invested billions of everyone's money in that pipeline.
1525 2018-11-22 21:13:48 Squeaky wheel gets the oil , here's hoping Lynch will spill some beans
1526 2018-11-22 21:13:41 I remember that time when meg paid £300 for a new exhausted which still didn’t fix her car... to be told it was just her oil which costed £35  @MeganEatock #muggedrightoff
1527 2018-11-22 21:13:38 You "don't care anymore" about Saudi Arabia, but the other day you gave a shout out to Saudi Arabia for lowering oil prices for the US.  Make up your goddamned mind. 
Rinse and Repeat.
1528 2018-11-22 21:13:37 Midnight Oil and Gas #SimonBridgesKiwiBandNames
1529 2018-11-22 21:13:33 i bought an aroma diffuser and lavender essential oil today, anxiety WHO? self doubt WHO? suddenly i am in touch with my soul and own multiple crystals
1530 2018-11-22 21:13:32 This actually doesn’t capture the full picture given the massive spread between Western Canadian Select and conventional oil. He ought to thank the environmentalists and indigenous activists who have killed multiple pipeline projects!
1531 2018-11-22 21:13:27 @andrewcbc I believe Enbridge Line 7 pipeline joins Superior hub to Sarnia. Many other pipelines feed Alberta oil to the Superior hub. So Alberta oil does flow to Ontario through these pipelines. You can check with Susan.
1532 2018-11-22 21:13:21 Need some oil for those gears mate?
1533 2018-11-22 21:13:17 How did you find out peppermint oil was the best? Will definitely try it out! Thanks 
1534 2018-11-22 21:13:15 Dude? You had jack sh*t to do with the oil prices.   And if there are traffic jams, it is only trying to escape you.
1535 2018-11-22 21:13:00 You do realize SA is running out of oil don’t you???
1536 2018-11-22 21:12:53 Well that’s exactly as a nutbag city has one would’ve expected. Worth reminding ourselves the government of Saudi Arabia does not *actually control* the price of oil. They can just nudge it a bit.
1537 2018-11-22 21:12:48 I use oil of olay
1538 2018-11-22 21:12:48 I got my oil pen , ain’t go outside to smoke with nobody. Me: “ excuse me where is the restroom “ .
1539 2018-11-22 21:12:44 You DO realize that Saudi Arabia ramping up production is what made the price of oil go down globally right
1540 2018-11-22 21:12:43 โอ้ยความเด็กน้อยเพิ่งเห็นตายแล้วน่ารัก
1541 2018-11-22 21:12:38 But Saudi Arabia alone does not determine oil prices. Besides, his statement isn't accurate, anyway - he's comparing apples to oranges. The US benchmark was trading at $54/barrel, but the Brent benchmark was still over $80. He can't even keep his crudes straight.
1542 2018-11-22 21:12:26 my relationship is a vial of rose oil spilled on cement, which is to say i am oppressed
1543 2018-11-22 21:12:14 My God, Chris! This is beautiful right there! Thanks for including the audio of the sizzling oil.
1544 2018-11-22 21:12:11 Well those oil tycoons will charge you a mandatory road tax like in California. No matter you will pay.
1545 2018-11-22 21:11:52 I have converted several family members to use CBD oil and flower when they can.

1550 2018-11-22 21:11:21 No one wants that expect the people that get rich from moving oil by rail and help finance the NDP. Otherwise you would be correct.
1551 2018-11-22 21:11:06 I wouldn’t hold your breath buds. And this whole clusterfuck has seen oil execs tell us they’re done investing in Canada. But of course, Trudeau doesn’t need Alberta votes so we’re fucked.
1552 2018-11-22 21:11:01 Oil money made Nigeria lazy, returning fully to Agriculture with technology will make us strong.Agriculture is the answer for better economy
1553 2018-11-22 21:10:53 Fishing is hardly a key economic issue any more as boats were decommissioned many gladly left to go to the Oil sector and are  unlikely to return to previous level. The CFP restrictions have reduced its attraction but that does not stop the Tories using it for political purposes
1554 2018-11-22 21:10:53 @butterball just wanted to say, while my use of 3 gallons of oil might be a little wasteful the fact I can cook the turkey in <1 hour, and clean up in even less time than that, well....
 I love the electric fryer.

1556 2018-11-22 21:10:38 What happened to all that Iraq oil we supposedly stole?
1557 2018-11-22 21:10:33 Are you not aware of that before you buy form? Why are ppl not going to college of technology? That is y many are not employable, in Germany 70% of high school leaver's goes to technical college, here after reading history, u want to work in oil company
1558 2018-11-22 21:10:32 - coconut oil

1559 2018-11-22 21:10:28 Yes. Avez-vous lu l’article en question?
1560 2018-11-22 21:10:17 LOL! Yes, cut trade with Canada's biggest partner. That totally won't fuck our economy in every hole it has. Your virtue signalling autism would make as great a PM as Trudeau's. We shouldn't be exporting the 40% we should be refining our crude and selling finished oil
1561 2018-11-22 21:10:11 Happy Thanksgiving from TXOGA! As you celebrate friends and family, remember that oil and gas allows you to heat your home, travel to see loved ones, and cook a delicious Thanksgiving meal.

1567 2018-11-22 21:09:28 Oil has always been boom or bust. The smart ones save their money for the lean times. At least they don’t have to pay sales tax
1568 2018-11-22 21:09:27 sure CBC and CTV should promote Ms. "Low Class Oil Trash" 'cause we all know she's got some real intelligent points to make 
1569 2018-11-22 21:09:15 Heavily drunk, I mistook the contents of the glass for white wine and swallowed the thick liquid in one gulp. It tasted awful -- it was olive oil.
1570 2018-11-22 21:09:10 I’m calling BS. We don’t buy oil from Them. We are almost the number 1 producer of oil in the world, thanks to fracking. We’d be better off working with Venezuela to assist their government into a working government to get their oil production back up to par
1571 2018-11-22 21:09:02 omg literally my whole life I’ve had the weakest nails literally i used to be able to bend them back they were that thin, 20 minutes in a bowl of olive oil has made them so strong and fixed nearly all the damage from acrylics love that
1572 2018-11-22 21:08:59 Two back injuries, blown out both shoulders, blown right knee, plate in my neck. CBD oil has changed my life. Far, Far less pain.

1574 2018-11-22 21:08:46 Oil pens, edibles, and cranberry sauce tonight. Furmanski’s play no games. Happy Holiday schizophrenic twitter community!!
1575 2018-11-22 21:08:39 The new oil discovered in Texas is a game changer that will even keep OPEC from raising prices.
1576 2018-11-22 21:08:39 Supposedly the mod helps with the oil burning because it puts more negative pressure on the rings preventing those effects IIRC

1579 2018-11-22 21:08:25 The oil wasn’t getting back up to temp, so after an hour we pulled it out and put it in the roaster to try and save it.
1580 2018-11-22 21:08:24 Only 9% of our oil is imported from Saudi. If we had an admin that believed in green energy, we could easily replace S.A. with SOLAR.

1582 2018-11-22 21:08:08 World’s greatest negotiator doesn’t even understand the basic principles of supply and demand. And you get 40% of oil from Canada. Fucktard. #MoronInChief
1583 2018-11-22 21:07:52 Standing over a fried turkey achieving my one true ambition of smelling like peanut oil
1584 2018-11-22 21:07:48 Ben, you can’t be serious? Cmon man you’re making a complete fool out of yourself.  You think buying, transporting, refining oil is like buying widgets huh? Ok I’ll stop enjoy your thanksgiving.
1585 2018-11-22 21:07:43 They have oil SO no biggie!!
1586 2018-11-22 21:07:37 you lost me at "get it cheaper elsewhere." No oil on the planet is as cheap as ours because all of our production is bottlenecked and can't leave the province. We just want access to the world market. Harper failed at this too, not just a shot at Trudeau or Notley.
1587 2018-11-22 21:07:34 It’s not just oil prices that have prairie provinces concerned. #ruralcanadamatters

1591 2018-11-22 21:07:00 Hearts are delicious. Back in my day, you could get a carton of chicken hearts. Poor man's escargot, fried in olive oil with garlic salt and pepper. Yum!
1592 2018-11-22 21:06:52 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
The current low oil prices are not acceptable to the member states of #OPEC and #Russia. They may release upbeat news during the weekend to pump up oil prices. If you are locked up in a bear trap Friday, you are heading into a big trouble next week.
1593 2018-11-22 21:06:37 My mom’s bf roasted a turkey and fried another one in peanut oil. I sneaked a piece of turkey and then overheard my mom talking about one being in peanut oil and I got so scared
1594 2018-11-22 21:06:29 What are the Saudis going to do with their oil? Drink it? Trump is as dumb as a box of rocks.
1595 2018-11-22 21:06:25 Also her oil change is 10,000 miles past due and she has had her car for almost 2 years and just last night I taught her how to use her headlights

1598 2018-11-22 21:06:07 It’s a shame you’re missing it. I never imagined MP would be so physical in this programme about Turkish oil wrestling and its influence on contemporary pole dancing.
1599 2018-11-22 21:06:06 I'm surprised how so many are still hung up on Hillary who testified without legal representation and after what seemed like years never got anything on her. Looks to me like Fox propaganda machine is starting to need oil. There is nothing wrong in an open transparent hearing
1600 2018-11-22 21:06:02 Don't fuck up our oil flow tho.what goes around comes around.
1601 2018-11-22 21:06:02 How can I get it.. the perfume oil.. I stay at ikorodu
1602 2018-11-22 21:06:00 So much media and still the National Press provides pitifully lacking coverage of the massive oil spill off our East Coast. There would be More coverage if a gas can spilled it's contents on a Toronto street
1603 2018-11-22 21:06:00 time alright...think we will all see some birthdays and age together.
1604 2018-11-22 21:05:57 will one day burn. Our inability to sell outside of the states means that every day is Black Friday for our oil. And yes, it was hilariously inefficient at $100 oil, a bubble waiting to pop, and that has corrected. Companies are leaner and meaner now, happens every cycle. But...
1605 2018-11-22 21:05:48 MMTers accusing other people of being snake oil salesmen. The irony
1606 2018-11-22 21:05:48 Oil is a global commodity. American oil companies, such as they are, have a significant impact on how much & where oil is processed & shipped. The Saudi royal family knows Exxon very well. The influence of the USA is not just in it's domestic consumption.
1607 2018-11-22 21:05:39 Also thank you to everyone who continues to follow me and support me even though this content train has been running on oil for a while. I hope to get more things out soon!
1608 2018-11-22 21:05:35 Let’s not forget that the Saudis are paying off KKKrooked Adolf Trump. They helped raise oil/gas prices. Compare price gouging since Adolf and his swamp took office.
1609 2018-11-22 21:05:35 He is anti oil and his past actions prove that.
He can meet and talk with whomever he wants, but his agenda is to limit or kill completely the oil industry.
1610 2018-11-22 21:05:31 Once I burned my face chemically from a mask and I used coconut oil right after and my skin wasn’t damaged the next morning
1611 2018-11-22 21:05:30 Guess what dummy? Oil prices go up and down.
1612 2018-11-22 21:05:28 This is complete nonsense. You didn’t make the oil prices relax, just as you weren’t responsible for the stock market gains.
1613 2018-11-22 21:05:24 A price drop on less than 3% of the oil this country buys will NOT lower gas prices! Common sense!
People are driving more at this time because of the holiday commonly called THANKSGIVING, you know, going to be with their families?

Sorry everyone, trump is a total dunce!
1614 2018-11-22 21:05:15 All these crusty niggas in this house and not one of em got coconut oil.Stay out my shit !!! $2 per oz
1615 2018-11-22 21:05:12 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
1616 2018-11-22 21:05:04 I did check Lenigas a few times. 
if he thinned down he would be quite nice looking.
1617 2018-11-22 21:04:56 If we are all going to die because the earth is too hot, you really think getting off oil is going to change this?  What proof do you have that man has capacity to change anything?
1618 2018-11-22 21:04:50 Was just reading that the world oil supply will run out in 57 years. That should help that nasty greenhouse gas problem. Good time to get into whale oil futures.
1619 2018-11-22 21:04:41 What, oil etc.? Tell me one successful socialist country.
1620 2018-11-22 21:04:27 CBD doesn't help me sleep. 1:1 oil ratio helps a lot. The Thc help me sleep while the CBD helps with my IBD
1621 2018-11-22 21:04:18 Saudi is part of OPEC which has a tremendous impact on worldwide oil costs.
1622 2018-11-22 21:04:02 But the oil prices!
1623 2018-11-22 21:04:02 U.S is at best an average economy without oil guarantees from Arabs & cheap & easy resources from Africa.
1624 2018-11-22 21:04:00 Invest in oil sector if you are interested inbox me..Kaleem.ahmed81@gmail.com
1625 2018-11-22 21:03:59 How it is I taking multivitamins and cod liver oil and still coming home and feeling like a corpse? I fed up oui
1626 2018-11-22 21:03:41 How many times did you check it yourself Heid?
1627 2018-11-22 21:03:36 Maybe she was born out of an oil drum?
1628 2018-11-22 21:03:27 No one in their right mind wants blood money from your Saudi friends, nor do we need their oil. Some people value other things in life like integrity, courage, kindness, love, respect...but you wouldn’t understand, because greed is the only language you speak. #JusticeForJamal
1629 2018-11-22 21:03:26 First scene in this Nollywood movie and this guy is already using magic powers to conjure rice, oil and seasonings. 

You can’t buy rice? 
1630 2018-11-22 21:03:21 Every morning I cook my breakfast with no shirt on and every morning I splash myself with hot as fuck oil. I’m so dumb
1631 2018-11-22 21:03:18 
1632 2018-11-22 21:03:09 Stop lying! You had no part in deciding oil prices! I'm tired of you taking credit for the work of others and placing blame on others for your hideous actions!
1633 2018-11-22 21:02:58 It's those big pot of oil turkey cookers.
1634 2018-11-22 21:02:54 The increase in oil & gas production would have never occurred if it was dependent on the government's approval on public lands. The Obama administration did everything it could to shut down that avenue of production, it was private industry doing it despite government
1635 2018-11-22 21:02:51 I mean, do you get along with your sister? Do you want to buy some essential oils? Really, you should become an essential oil consultant. It will change your life!
1636 2018-11-22 21:02:42 Oil companies interests are to have a sustainable, profitable industry.  If anyone thinks they are happy about these events, they are very wrong.
1637 2018-11-22 21:02:33 Peanut oil? What my fam using
1638 2018-11-22 21:02:32 Haaaa! For real! They just pour hot oil or water and peel off the skin Na.
Oniranu something
1639 2018-11-22 21:02:29 Cheers Matt. Normally just use water based for test prints; easy to clean up! Started using Caligo recently for final prints. It’s Oil based, but washes up with soapy water. Used the purely oil based ink by accident! I need to clearly mark my ink!
1640 2018-11-22 21:02:28 How about your EIA- "Despite plummeting oil prices, U.S. retail regular-grade gasoline averaged $2.61 per gallon (gal), up 4 cents/gal from the same time last year. This year marks the highest gasoline price for the Monday before the Thanksgiving holiday weekend since 2014."
1641 2018-11-22 21:02:20 You have nothing to do with low gasoline prices MORON!! They’re set by the Global Oil Markets. Something you have no control over.
1642 2018-11-22 21:02:00 Love how clean my car is when I get it back from my FREE oil changes at @LexusOfEdmonton. Best service in the city baby 
1643 2018-11-22 21:01:58 The only thing my family entrusted me with the turkey was checking on it n... I poured out some of the oil into the oven n almost started a fire. Happy Thanksgiving!
1644 2018-11-22 21:01:42 The gods of the Niger Delta had not allowed Nigeria nor the oil well owners to find peace or growth in real sense. Non can prosper with what is stolen from others. Godwin onion Sanco Esq
1645 2018-11-22 21:01:38 You haven’t done anything about oil prices!
Anything positive you take credit for and anything negative you blame someone else!
So predictable!
You are correct about traffic jams being your fault because our infrastructure is so bad!
What happened to you fixing it?
@RepAdamSchiff
1646 2018-11-22 21:01:38 I went in a Co-op searching for the Malteasers Truffles and they have a smaller version of the one I got my sister.

I also saw some lady get caught stealing some whip cream and baby oil 
1647 2018-11-22 21:01:36 Albertans know the current oil price is a crisis.
What did you do about it two years ago or last year.
Nothing to solve the issue.
@JustinTrudeau #cdnpoli
1648 2018-11-22 21:01:35 I think it will been in ukog since 2015 could have sold at 11p but I think this is going from to aim main market and will pay dividends...just a time thing heid
1649 2018-11-22 21:01:14 "Have you tried any natural solutions to your anxiety?"

* cut to me doing lines of lavender oil off the case of a whale noises CD *

"Yeah... It didn't work"
1650 2018-11-22 21:01:09 Can't wash this oil off our hands...
1651 2018-11-22 21:01:07 Thanks giving wat the fuck 4 people angels children humans again HUMANS being fucked off  by corrupt bastards yeah Africa weres all the fucking money gone israile palastyne as well saudia but weres your an oil state but Yemen there human Muslim and the Koran came from saudia I
1652 2018-11-22 21:00:51 Shrink acne by placing a wrapped ice cube on it and leave it on the pimple for 3 minutes. Then cover it with a dab of lavender oil.
1653 2018-11-22 21:00:47 اهو اي شي يثبت ههههههههههههه
1654 2018-11-22 21:00:46 @realDonaldTrump @vp @HouseGOP @SenateGOP @washingtonpost so if Saudia Arabia is the land of oil... why in the HELL are you drilling in America... and not going after clean energy... all members of the Russian Nazi Party of America supporting this administration should ...
1655 2018-11-22 21:00:45 The Niger Delta region palaver is unarguably endemic in the discuss of Nigeran state and indeed its economy. There is no gain reminding us of the region's stat of infrastructural decay and neglect by the federal goverment and multi national oil explorations
1656 2018-11-22 21:00:44 That's a positive way to look at it. I'm working now burning the Midnight oil and I can see  what the Prof is talking about....im actually getting excited with making these corrections I think I'll be done soon.
1657 2018-11-22 21:00:38 Not that much, really. 10% of our total oil import comes from SA. We get 40% from Canada and he insults them. Its not about oil prices. It's about how much the Royal family will invest in him. It's not about us.
1658 2018-11-22 21:00:32 Dumb people think they’re smart? Ok.  I’ll stop laughing now.  Only you’re making an assumption I’m dumb when all I have to do is read your last 10 tweets on a subject you have zero clue on.  Again, if SA wanted to they could put the price of oil at 150 in 6 months.
1659 2018-11-22 21:00:30 no, And disheartening that it's rarely talked about that one of the most plausible explanations as to why the UK and US invaded is because of the move by Gaddaffi to reject dollar and set up an African currency to trade oil in.

1661 2018-11-22 21:00:22 *Fights tooth and nail for 40 years against any policy that would stop us from being the only crude producer who gets minimal national benefit from oil royalties besides Dutch disease, reminisces about Kleinbucks, hates Quebec* You NEED us!
1662 2018-11-22 21:00:22 Coconut oil is very healthy. It is high in special fats called medium chain triglycerides, which are metabolized differently than other fats
1663 2018-11-22 21:00:17 What we need to do is look out for certified sustainable palm oil. The power is with us, the consumers, to save the orangutans and to help the people of Borneo.

Please do not boycott #palmoil but #buysustainable
1664 2018-11-22 21:00:14 @CBCAlerts Nothing about the protest here in Calgary? It’s not news when the Oil and Gas industry is being gutted?
1665 2018-11-22 21:00:12 zayden won’t take out the explosive oil from my body.. you have a lot of nerve
1666 2018-11-22 21:00:11 The oil market is global and supply is fungible. Besides we get almost all our imported oil from Canada and Mexico.
1667 2018-11-22 21:00:07 Thanks to Obama for decreasing our dependence on oil from the Middle East.
1668 2018-11-22 21:00:07 So in other news, Aragorn's arrived at Helm's Deep and his hair has finally achieved maximum oil/dirt saturation.

I mean, not that I'm complaining. I'd still hit that. #LOTR
1669 2018-11-22 20:59:55 And the US pays a lot less for Cdn oil than it does Saudi. Go figure.
1670 2018-11-22 20:59:53 But I got the opportunity to meet locals to the island who highlighted the fact that they need to farm to survive. If we were to boycott all palm oil then these people would have to find something else to make their living. We are therefore not fixing the problem
1671 2018-11-22 20:59:49 Just need alkaline water poured over my body like baby oil.
1672 2018-11-22 20:59:40 Yes it helps if you can oil from the mid of your hair till the end, argon or olive is Gucci 
Not too much tho
1673 2018-11-22 20:59:31 I been thinking on putting one on just to cool the oil
1674 2018-11-22 20:59:25 well hopefully 2019 will be our year.
1675 2018-11-22 20:59:11 The tax rate was low at that time.
Excise on petrol was 9.48 at that time which increased upto 21.48 in current times.
However I do acknowledge that it has been reduced by 2 now.

But why did BJP cry at that time for the Oil prices when it was not in UPA's hands??
1676 2018-11-22 20:59:10 Oil prices getting breasts. Hot Rocks! Dislike a ball bag Tax Bird-Washing for America and the Hot Rocks. Whorehouse! $54, was unjust $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s cum boobs!
1677 2018-11-22 20:59:02 Okay, so what do you think the government should do? More handouts to the oil sector? Is that the solution?
1678 2018-11-22 20:58:59 Mann also lied to Congress. But, hey, it was to "save the planet" so he was actually being honest in disguise. 

/snark

But it's hard to be honest *and* sell snake oil.
1679 2018-11-22 20:58:30 Complain,complain,always looking back,when obj took over in 1999,oil was $16,he did not lament and blame the previous government for not leaving much money behind.
1680 2018-11-22 20:58:26 Came across an interesting #article title while searching through old @TorontoStar articles on microfilm from '74: "#Nuclear Blast Could Free #Oil." Someone thought this was a good idea? 

#notsogoodideas
1681 2018-11-22 20:58:17 Trump gets lower oil prices
Kushner gets his money
Saudi gets to kill that pesky journalist and now settles for loses on oil but avoids sanctions.
Turkey gets their dissident? 

It’s a win, win, win, win. Only one dead journalist and another dissident’s life in jeopardy. Not bad.
1682 2018-11-22 20:58:15 I'll forgive you for criticizing/not eating mushrooms (particularly if they're sautéed in olive oil or butter with salt and pepper) because there's no amount of seasoning, brine or aging that'll  make Trump's preternaturally orange carcass so yummy. #EatTheRich
1683 2018-11-22 20:58:15 Norway has nearly 98% of production from Hydro.... Not solar, wind or batteries. Plus their major export is crude oil. You’ve completely fucked up here. Should we build hundreds of dams in Australia?
1684 2018-11-22 20:58:10 What are you saying, Scheer Nonsense? The actions announced this week by the Liberal government will increase the deficit, which you complained about. Now you want him to help the oil and gas sector which makes its own profits. That should push the deficit into the 22nd century.
1685 2018-11-22 20:58:06 This is what is truly frightening. Trump's base gets loss before they even reach their 200 characters limit. Any rebuttal gets you attacked as a moron. I never realized so many people would buy so many bottles from a snake oil peddler.
1686 2018-11-22 20:58:06 Win Jan canola down A$0.27/t but EU rape up A$2.64. Rapeseed plantings being hit by dry weather in the EU but acreage increases expected for Canada & Ukraine. Support from lift in palm oil prices. US mkts closed for Thanksgiving.
1687 2018-11-22 20:57:52 As much as I like to see people on social media talking about the use of palm oil, I feel like the main point is being missed. We do not want to stop palm oil, we only want to stop the unsustainable farming of palm oil. (Pt1 continued..)
1688 2018-11-22 20:57:47 Better to use sustainable palm oil rather than boycott/cut out completely as the demand for alternative oils may actually cause more deforestion.
1689 2018-11-22 20:57:45 If the US finds out there is oil underneath that island, bye-bye!
1690 2018-11-22 20:57:32 Pompeo will say whatever he needs to do to please you @realDonaldTrump. You both will be recognized as supporting regimes that knowingly torture and kill US citizens and residents. If you want to thank the largest supplier of oil to the US (40%), thank @JustinTrudeau. Saudis 9%.
1691 2018-11-22 20:57:26 Lol my wife thinks I'm mad investing in aim she keeps asking me how are your shares doing and she says they were at that 5 years ago we are not retiring yet lol
1692 2018-11-22 20:57:01 Lotion makes them feel better but is probably most of the problem. Try switching to coconut oil.
1693 2018-11-22 20:56:48 Hi TIK:  i buy your oil theory about why germany attacked soviet, but what about:
1 german troops not caring to put out oil fires
2 germany uses gasoline, soviets use diesel, so no good.
       (Didn't  1st auto engine benz use diesel ?)
Thnks -a.a
1694 2018-11-22 20:56:34 Put some peppermint oil on your tummy. It’s magic.
1695 2018-11-22 20:56:32 Nobody I know who’s ever had any contact with the oil industry in any way is anything like this lol
1696 2018-11-22 20:56:28 my whole family is talking about how “big pharma” is evil and CBD oil cures everything... hey @sydneemcelroy can i conference u in REAL quick
1697 2018-11-22 20:56:24 Supprimer les taxes essence et gas oil. Mettre en route une réforme immédiate des dépenses outrancières de l état pour réduire le déficit et à plus long terme les impôts. Quand va t  on se mettre au travail!
1698 2018-11-22 20:56:19 Maybe you should be more critical of your sources.
1) This is an op-ed, not a news report.
2) The owners of this paper are heavily invested in oil/gas.
3) The owners of this paper are unapologetic Conservative supporters.
4) The author of this op-ed is a British Conservative.
1699 2018-11-22 20:56:15 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
The majority of WTI traders are in the #US and the #UK/#Eurpope. The countries in the Far East such as #Japan, #SouthKorea and #China don't have many traders interested in WTI trading. This is the reason why WTI is always like a dead man during Asia session.
1700 2018-11-22 20:56:09 CBD oil is weed based omegalol
1701 2018-11-22 20:56:08 This Thanksgiving, I give thanks for being stronger than turkeys. ‘Cause otherwise there’d be a drunk turkey trying stick my fat ass in a pot of oil. Good lookin’ out Mother Nature.
1702 2018-11-22 20:56:05 Trudeau is in Calgary trying to bullshit the troops. His answers to questions are no more relevant and meaningful than when he speaks to a hall full of high school students. I hope the oil execs strip him to pieces this afternoon.
1703 2018-11-22 20:55:44 If only there was a way to get a better price for our crude oil, we could afford to lose a few LAV jobs in southern Ontario.
1704 2018-11-22 20:55:27 No. Our oil is only around 11 dollars a barrel. No one is working. There is no investment. Nothing
1705 2018-11-22 20:55:24 Why can’t government be sued for creating an unequal playing field for the Press. That isn’t freedom of the Press. If you want uneven playing field in autos or tech or oil, those aren’t fundamental rights and responsibilities of governance in the free world. Very dangerous days
1706 2018-11-22 20:55:22 Come to C9 block 2
1707 2018-11-22 20:55:22 But even gas prices are a lie. We get our oil from Canada, can’t explain why hates Trudeau  and loves Putin, Kim and MBS.
1708 2018-11-22 20:55:14 So does it have to be done in a pan? Cos I'd probably think of calling it that when I slow roast those veg with lots of olive oil and e.g. oregano - comes out very similar?
1709 2018-11-22 20:55:12 it’s only been one minute and I smell like plantain oil, smh
1710 2018-11-22 20:55:11 News flash Tulsi. Saudi Arabia is less of an ally and more of a need for oil. We have to kiss ass for what we get because right now, because we don't have enough green/clean, renewable sources of energy or able to step up our own oil drilling and production, we are stuck w/ them.
1711 2018-11-22 20:55:06 She made mention of upgrading the oil ourselves, so hopefully that's where they'll go with that
1712 2018-11-22 20:55:05 Mr Hulot, auriez vous le courage de dire ce soir que le GAS OIL malgré le rejet des particules fines, pollue moins que l'essence sans plomb!? #EmissionPolitique
1713 2018-11-22 20:55:04 Sir you need to declare your conflict of interests. Such as being  funded by the palm oil industry.
1714 2018-11-22 20:55:01 Do business with SA but don’t sell your soul..SA has consistently been on the dark side because they know they have oil and US supports despite 9/11 murders , Yemen genocide and decades on manipulation of OIL through OPEC OIL CARTEL. SA has abused US much more than IRAN!
1715 2018-11-22 20:55:01 태왕계유..둘이..결혼해
1716 2018-11-22 20:54:52 You rubbing oil on your meat sort of sums you up Gino 
1717 2018-11-22 20:54:28 Allah ya qara daukaka.
1718 2018-11-22 20:54:24 Saudi Arabia supplies us with oil which america smothers to death with. If we moved on from oil Saudi Arabia will be left in the dust.

We aren’t creating enemies from allies lol, just disagreements.

Diplomacy is more important than the false flag of gun control
1719 2018-11-22 20:54:23 Yes. I agree with you all in prayer for @AGLotz . In Christ we come Father. Thank You for hearing us. We believe You for healing, comfort, recovery, and increasing faith for our sister in Christ. In Jesus' wonderful name,  amen. PS: Consider Pure CBD oil.

1721 2018-11-22 20:54:10 oil issues......
1722 2018-11-22 20:54:05 So the way I see it or it could be viewed I suppose, htis federal government has managed to kill the oil & gas indusry & summer jobs for youth if it wasn`t on board with their koolaid. Impressive enough alone, but coup de gras: Kill the media industry too. Hate to see what`s next
1723 2018-11-22 20:54:03 News flash "genious" you did not get gas prices lower! The oil pricing is set by OPEC which YOU have no control over! FYI Thanksgiving is the most popular holiday for travel! There have always been traffic jams! But you could do something for infrastructure!
1724 2018-11-22 20:53:57 The more electric cars and hybrid vehicles we have, the less we depend on oil,, thanks to Obama and stick regulations to make cars run cleaner,, we are less dependent on oil, and better and cleaner air,,, Donald drink all the Saudi oil you want, we don't need it
1725 2018-11-22 20:53:54 What is that 'Oil Industry & Reproductive Rights' in response to, on her ID?
1726 2018-11-22 20:53:50  Ok. Oil is on 
1727 2018-11-22 20:53:46 Just don't think of starting a oil related business.
1728 2018-11-22 20:53:33 I hear folks be using the baby oil gel
1729 2018-11-22 20:53:22 Why can't we keep our own oil and make our own prices?
1730 2018-11-22 20:53:11 Use any hair oil like olive oil or coconut oil on damp hair. Applying oil or product on damp hair absorbs better.
1731 2018-11-22 20:53:01 Don’t think so
peppermint is one of many EOs that is said can help treat candida, and I didn’t find anything that says it would increase UTIs 

CBD oil is a very popular lube too so with proper dilution, seems like you’re good to go.

Go home Justin, we don't want you here.

1736 2018-11-22 20:52:40 You actually have zilch, zero, 0, nada, and any other way u can understand your bearing on oil prices.  About as much as you are a president (a real zero).

1739 2018-11-22 20:52:26 Vegan diet is not for everyone for two reasons, if you try replace the oil found in dairy youll consume a liver punt, and sodium found in nuts alone is hearthritis, so bottom line create ahimsa dairy, you squirt each other with germs no nutrients really but complain about nature?
1740 2018-11-22 20:52:24 The year is 2050, the world is undergoing a massive crisis. With much of the population suffering the consequences of climate change. There r food shortages, water levels r on the rise, people are displaced from their homes all because oil&gas corporations bought out politicians
1741 2018-11-22 20:52:23 "The next generation will be worse than the present generation"

The next generation will meet the kind of problems that will separate the wheat from the chaff. This generation is lucky, they still have oil money.
1742 2018-11-22 20:52:19 Oil oil oil oil. What about people asshole?
1743 2018-11-22 20:52:16 Hunny...he better cut than that the added oil is taking away at this point.

1747 2018-11-22 20:52:05 You’re Wrong. The price fluctuation per gallon on a tank fill up can barely top the price of a cup of coffee.  If the price of a barrel of oil is down so significantly, where’s the reflection at the pump?  It’s ALL talk and ALL bullshit.
1748 2018-11-22 20:52:03 Like, how? Trump is hoping you dont realize he supports them over us & has done nothing to help. Prices to us are up. Oil companies fat.
1749 2018-11-22 20:52:01 this just in: 

"[SFU] is currently committed to reducing the carbon footprint of the institution’s investment portfolio by at least 30 percent by 2030."

SFU's 'plan' is to continue to own millions in oil and gas stock in the year 2030. 

got it.
1750 2018-11-22 20:52:00 Lifetime Engine Warranty. Lifetime Oil Changes. Lifetime Inspections and free gas for a year kinda make leasing/financing a lil more appealing
1751 2018-11-22 20:51:52 You know oil is a commodity, right? It’s a world wide market traded on exchanges. If the price goes down on one side of the planet that pushes the price down everywhere. You know that, I hope. @AAhronheim
1752 2018-11-22 20:51:40 Thus guy is double talk and Zero action time to kick him out and get the oil moving
1753 2018-11-22 20:51:31 Your use of the word we is alarming.  Please research the vostic ice core data.   It has been warmer and it was long  before dodge invented the hemi.    That being said, burning less oil is a good thing for all.
1754 2018-11-22 20:51:22 You only need about 10 drops of oil. The heat  of the bath usually vaporises the oil and you inhale the fumes. And yes I know you were being sarky.!
1755 2018-11-22 20:51:12 Joe McMonigle, an analyst with Hedgeye Risk Management and former Department of Energy chief of staff: "Banks are already nervous about providing support for oil transactions with Venezuela. This move would only raise the barrier."

1757 2018-11-22 20:51:08 @JustinTrudeau  So Canada's buying oil at ~$50 a barrel, and selling our tarsands oil at ~$13 a barrel, why don't you just fucking pipeline that cheap tarsands oil to Ontario and refine it there? Oh, was opposition to Energy East more Vehement than Opposition to TMX?
1758 2018-11-22 20:51:04 Guys, I think I'm really an Albertan now. I'm at a lunch listening to people talk about the energy sector and I checked an app that I have just for oil prices. #cdnpoli #ableg #pipelinesforeveryone
1759 2018-11-22 20:51:03 Is this man gonna check my oil?
1760 2018-11-22 20:50:57 Good afternoon South Sudan.  We are seeking to revive our oil production. We are only producing 20,000 barrels a day when we have the capacity to produce 40,000 barrels.
1761 2018-11-22 20:50:47 When the price of crude oil fall too low from 70-30$/b, we had scarcity of FX(dollars) to finance our imports, Naira fall, cost of imports went up, which led to price inflation on all products and items in our markets since most of them were imported into the country
1762 2018-11-22 20:50:45 I believe yields come down dramatically and rather soon on treasuries.Corporate yields eventually but if we enter a recession yields may blow out and downgrades will occur.We should also see a lot of defaults on the real junk names especially in the oil area. $WFT $SN $JCP $FTR
1763 2018-11-22 20:50:10 Something about government inaction re pipeline and other oil related with the economy.
1764 2018-11-22 20:50:08 Any your clearly a Zionist. No, I don’t support Iran’s gov. I just don’t want USA conducting anymore wars for oil & Israel. I actually think all of middle eastern countries should have democracy, not be led by religious fanatics and monarchies. USA needs to stay out of it.

1767 2018-11-22 20:50:00 oil diffusers are fucking gross
1768 2018-11-22 20:49:53 Still no explanation. The thread ended by trying to make people that asked for accountability look insensitive.

@SFU's 'plan' is to continue to own millions in oil and gas stock in the year 2030.

1771 2018-11-22 20:49:43 Why not build refineries in Alberta to process the oil. Keep Canada working
1772 2018-11-22 20:49:41 Peanut oil, fry 3 min per lb, and flip turkey for last 15 min...for best taste, inject and marinate for 24 hours b4 frying...
1773 2018-11-22 20:49:41 PCs ran Alberta into ground. Unlike Norway where every citizen was poor but on discovery of oil now is well off, Alberta and Saskatchewan gave back what to its people other than wasteland and a bankrupt govt once oil prices went down? Free universities? Better healthcare?
1774 2018-11-22 20:49:35 @PizzaExpress when you order the vegan doughballs because the harissa and tomato dip sounds awesome. To then be sent a pot of oil... along with a stone cold pizza #wasteofmoney
1775 2018-11-22 20:49:27 As an Ottawa-insider, @jkenney tossed Alberta's oil and gas sector under the bus. He failed to get a pipeline built to tidewater. He wiped out $35.0 billion by taxing income trusts. And—he attempted to sabotage a $15.1 billion energy deal. #yyc #ableg #cdnpoli
1776 2018-11-22 20:49:24 Get on this oil in a min
1777 2018-11-22 20:49:19 So GEJ wrote a book without mentioning the $15m cash seized by SA govt or his involvement in Malabu/Eni oil cash bribe or over $30m forfeited by his wife to fed govt or tell us about the 12 suite cases full of dollars he ordered Dasuki to bring to his private residence?
1778 2018-11-22 20:49:16 Profits before people. But the U. S. is producing shale oil that’s driven prices down!? Another patent lie. How money does trump’s family owe the Saudis?
1779 2018-11-22 20:49:12 What an awful article. Instead of bowing to the oil heirs, we could be using cleaner alternative fuel for our cars.
1780 2018-11-22 20:49:08 So were the governors that drained our excess crude account ?
Who were the governors,the forerunners and instigators who initiated law suits against the FG against saving excess made from crude oil sales ?

1784 2018-11-22 20:49:03 It’s kind heart warming seeing all these men that have clearly never stepped into a grocery store trying to figure out what olive oil is while arguing with their wives on the phone.. #Progress
1785 2018-11-22 20:49:02 I also hope you didn't forget that the Oil & Gas industry ran in a completely inefficient manner with enormous bloat due to poor management.

Only once they realized the rest of the world could get the same product cheaper elsewhere did they start trying to fix any of this.
1786 2018-11-22 20:49:01 Which “world price” would that be?  WTI? Brent?  In case you’re stuck in tunnel vision, oil prices are dropping all over the world.  And WCS has had a “discount” for many years.  It’s not a new thing.
1787 2018-11-22 20:48:37 If the truth is to be told, the killing of Savimbi involve not only Did Santos, but the entire SADC. They thought Angola would be generous with its oil. They were used as Kabila used them to kick out the Tutsis.
1788 2018-11-22 20:48:36 Because nobody in China or Eastern Asia uses oil and gas? Get real.
1789 2018-11-22 20:48:33 "Global oil demand has so far absorbed the extra U.S. crude barrels, limiting the impact on prices.".
[ Follow this thread.]
1790 2018-11-22 20:48:30 Agreed on that.  I just don't understand the opposition to pipelines from an environmental standpoint.  The oil continues to flow, just more of it by rail.  Rail is worse for the environment, worse for farmers, and worse for citizens of Canada and Alberta.  It's ridiculous.
1791 2018-11-22 20:48:28 Seems like a mixed bag as far as what they’re protesting! See some oil & signs, but also postal workers. Is it just an anyone that doesn’t like Trudeau protest?
1792 2018-11-22 20:48:25 Not really without major major labour intensive work. Easie to just top up the oil as and when tbh
1793 2018-11-22 20:48:23 Says u. PLEASE tell me what Assad has done. name 1 thing please. please don't go by FAKE or ONEWAY news either. The ONLY reason all these crap happend in Syria & BS lies about Mr. Assad, is for Isreal to take their land/oil too(like Golen Hights), but it didn't work out that way.
1794 2018-11-22 20:48:22 are you from Alberta? we pay no taxes other than income tax to Ottawa, and now the carbon tax, but if you read i say get rid of the carbon tax.
and how do you think we pay for everything?
why do you think we are billions in the hole when oil prices tank?
1795 2018-11-22 20:48:13 It was at .77 litre before. Now back to where it was at when oil was at highs. Government will go after companies for bread price fixing but not gas. Lol
1796 2018-11-22 20:48:10 PM Trudeau says he wants to sit down with energy execs this afternoon to discuss solutions to oil crisis won’t  commit to more trains.
1797 2018-11-22 20:47:59 Why does it always happen when it’s freezing cold? I remember one year I couldn’t get the oil delivered for 4 days. Never felt cold like it. 
I’ve got a supply of blow heaters in the shed.

1800 2018-11-22 20:47:50 Did not see that . Just read that people are shocked that you think been given lower oil prices for overlooking an international murder / assassination shows your character to be morally flexible and bankrupt . And I believe you did pull America out of the Paris climate change ?
1801 2018-11-22 20:47:49 Ooh, maybe an essential oil rollerball?

1804 2018-11-22 20:47:36 Brine it. Look up "Apple Cider Turkey" by the BBQ pit boys on youtube. I used that recipe last year and it was the BUSINESS. also no boiling oil!
1805 2018-11-22 20:47:20 I know people with oil
1806 2018-11-22 20:47:09 Europe doesn’t need NATO to counter Russia. It’s clear the EU plans on forming a supernational state so that will be the counter (or an ally, if Putin can squeeze them in oil and gas). Our concern should be China and it’s expansionism
1807 2018-11-22 20:47:03 What Explains the Sudden Plunge in Ant Oil Exports?
1808 2018-11-22 20:47:02 Probably dealt with the most arrogant asshole at work. How are you gonna brag about the shit you just bought and get mad that a gallon of oil is 30$???
1809 2018-11-22 20:47:02 11% of oil they sale to america.. means that they can do anything ? nope...

1811 2018-11-22 20:46:48 i use cbd oil has settled my arthritis a bit. Not had a flare up in the few months I have been using it and taking less painkillers.
1812 2018-11-22 20:46:46 Main exports for BiH are milk, oil and paper products. The volume of trade exports is only about 4% so its not as if they are a major player. But they do hold almost all leverage in this "trade war". Reciprocal measure have little bearing here.
1813 2018-11-22 20:46:44 That describes Trump’s thinking. Forget the fact that the US produces as much, if not more, than the Saudi’s and that we get more oil from Canada- who @realDonaldTrump has no problem pissing off. This about Trump’s desire to continue to personally make money off the Saudi’s.
1814 2018-11-22 20:46:35 I probably shouldn't watch Hasan Minhaj's episode on Oil when I'm supposed to be relaxing. I've been taking this seriously for like a decade but hearing more about it still kills me.
1815 2018-11-22 20:46:29 Hey stupid.  It's not Saudia Arabia.  Their not our largest oil partner.  Stop supporting a corrupt govt.
1816 2018-11-22 20:46:18 Sir, Canada supplies most of our oil. Saudi Arabia specializes in body parts.

1822 2018-11-22 20:46:00 People with any decency, ethics or a spine would say a big FU to Saudi Arabia after ordering Khashoggi’s torture & murder. Tweeting about the price of oil & supporting MBS? Disgusting. @POTUS you are absolutely despicable! #ResignNow

1827 2018-11-22 20:45:20 Donald who are you trying to fool with your lies, maybe your supporters, but not the rest of American people.. The Saudis are not the reason for the low oil prices,, stop lying, cos you are only lying to yourself.
1828 2018-11-22 20:45:15 I not sure what’s wrong with Alberta! If they want the PM to try and fix oil for them, why would you treat him this way. If I was him, I wouldn’t bother trying too hard. They don’t appreciate anything that is done for them. When did AB people start acting like this. #abpoli
1829 2018-11-22 20:45:15 His Freudian slip admission that he wants to “phase out the oil sands,” saying something is wrong when Alberta directs Canada’s sociodemocratic agenda and that the best PMs are all from Quebec...
1830 2018-11-22 20:45:08 1. WTF?
2. I thought he was destroying the National Monuments because he wanted us to be oil independent?
3. I thought that he was polluting the air with coal because it he wanted us to be fuel independent.
Now we have cozy up to  because of oil?
1831 2018-11-22 20:45:07 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!

1834 2018-11-22 20:44:55 i love essential oils and all, but if you really think that rubbing a drop of oil on your child’s neck will help prevent them from getting chicken pox or other diseases then....bless your heart
1835 2018-11-22 20:44:54 Trump is hoping you not realize he has done only one thing about oil: promote pipelines that are not yet in operation. Sauds are dropping production, and prices  are quite high now, have only dropped in last 5 weeks.
1836 2018-11-22 20:44:46 Pssst

It only takes two eggs and half a cup of oil to turn any cake mix into easy cookies.
1837 2018-11-22 20:44:40 Global oil demand has never been higher. The reason the west CANADIAN Select sells for less than 1/6 of West Texas crude isn’t due to lack of demand  but an inability to supply
1838 2018-11-22 20:44:39 That's great, if it weren't for Saudi Arabia a news reporter would still be alive. That's nice that somebody's live has been disregarded for  money and oil. You are a compassionate human being.

1842 2018-11-22 20:44:06 well, no doubt the Arabs control the price of crude oil.
The precious crude and so important a value that all win and benefit, the poorest countries will also appreciate it.
1843 2018-11-22 20:43:55 @MaximeBernier Mr. Bernier. Could I please have your stand on the Alberta oil situation. Are you pro Energy East and 100% Canadian owned Refineries/Upgraders..OR are you for TMX and Keystone XL.. Thank you.
1844 2018-11-22 20:43:53 Shouldn't we be thanking Canada for our lower prices since they supply us with more oil than Saudi Arabia by maybe 30%?

1848 2018-11-22 20:43:39 @realDonaldTrump's tweet "thanking Saudi Arabia" for low oil prices is testament to his hate of the #media. More importantly it shows just how little he cares abt Americans.

Me to myself: Some if these ppl need to bathe in coconut oil.
1851 2018-11-22 20:43:12 The smell of the turkey cooking in a tub of oil is the most vile smell ever put into existence. I can’t believe people eat that 
1852 2018-11-22 20:43:10 Show us where he’s getting this oil
1853 2018-11-22 20:43:09 Someone needs to tell Trump that oil is fungible and is a global commodity. The price isn't set by Saudi Arabia. But anyone who tells him that will have to explain what fungible means.
1854 2018-11-22 20:42:41 No. I've been boycotting palm oil for months now, it's not stupid at all, it's a step in the right direction. You are influenced by business interests.
1855 2018-11-22 20:42:37 I tend to agree. Treasuries have to rally and the downgrades haven't started as much as they should. But I am long treasuries probably the most I've been ever. Oil coming down will collapse inflation numbers and ISM/hard data will fall. Trump wants oil lower, see his tweets
1856 2018-11-22 20:42:31 Thats because Harper and his cronies were traitors!! Bought off by U.S. and Saudi agenda money.
AB is earning 70% less for its oil thanks to these Conservative policies. Wake up

1859 2018-11-22 20:42:26 Les batteries sont recyclables pour d’autres usages : résidentiel notamment. Faux débat entretenu par la Big Oil Company. Méfiez vous.
1860 2018-11-22 20:42:22 Just a few facts that could impact your narrative. ~ The largest sources of U.S. imported oil were: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%).
1861 2018-11-22 20:42:22 where is this oil prices creating traffic jams story Trump is referring to? Or was he listening to a DC traffic report and made a narcissistic connection?
1862 2018-11-22 20:42:19 Thicker than an oil slick.
1863 2018-11-22 20:42:04 By the way I’m in Ontario. So the problem is Canadian not Alberta problem.  It impacts all of us.  Energy east would give Canada the ability to be self sufficient and not have to import oil from Saudi. Tmx would expand market.  Quebec gets let’s equalization on lower ab revenues.
1864 2018-11-22 20:41:53 The CIC likes taking it up the ass, he's a big anal fan. Kim un, Vlad with his impaler, Edrogan with his Turkish delight and now the asshole prince from the ass end of the world - a dust bowl with oil.
1865 2018-11-22 20:41:50 @renoomokri to refresh your memory, your president sold our oil for the higgest ever rate at 130$ per barrel and with all those funds he still emptied the nations treasury and you still siding with someone that even tagged himself a failure..OGA
1866 2018-11-22 20:41:49 I make gelatin all the time. I buy pure granular gelatin in canisters from Knox, Amazon.
I think they come 3 canisters to a case. 
My Ma/Pa pharmacy sells real fruit essences of oil in little bottles for........get this:
$.99 each! I use those to flavor the "jello".
1867 2018-11-22 20:41:44 So when oil prices go down, states like Ca. Keep raising % to maintain tax revenue. Ca. Is desperate, they are on the brink of financial collapse, they also have a large population, this would drive national averages up, not to mention other states, mostly controlled by Dems.
1868 2018-11-22 20:41:40 Nothing to do with oil whatsoever.

1870 2018-11-22 20:41:02 Someone has skeptically asked me "Why is supposed green group @EnvDefenseFund taking dirty money from the Norwegian government to promote dodgy REDD offsets which will let the oil industry off the hook and cause climate chaos?"

Can you give me a tip as to how I should answer?
1871 2018-11-22 20:41:01 Sign your family members up to go to war with Saudi Arabia. Hell volunteer yourself; go sign up. Get ready to start walking too when they cut off the oil supply. People get murdered every day by foreign governments and the American masses are silent because the media didn’t tell
1872 2018-11-22 20:40:52 heard you was poppin it but you run when the oil on the stove starts jumping smh typa shit is that
1873 2018-11-22 20:40:44 Oil prices are always the big nightmare for the ECB projections, but Eurosystem staff are always able to surprise us... on the wrong side.
1874 2018-11-22 20:40:40 Have noticed that U.S. oil production is way up and that could be a big reason prices are lower. Probably not because of your blind hate.

1882 2018-11-22 20:40:03 My vet suggested I add more fat to my horse’s diet. His coat is struggling, though a big part of that is the Cushings. He does not like oil in his grain and is funny about supplements. Any suggestions??
1883 2018-11-22 20:39:59 2000 barrels? .... 2000 barrels??? Lets get your numbers right or starters, 43% of US crude oil imports in 2017 @ 3.3 MILLION barrels per day... this data is widely available on Canadian and US sites......
1884 2018-11-22 20:39:59 Why are you singling out Trump.

This has been the MO of middle eastern oil nations for decades. Political, athletic, entertainment, corporate wealth seekers have looked the other way while accepting buckets of petro-dollars from Arabs. The difference is, they now "owe" Trump.

1889 2018-11-22 20:39:25 Live: Trudeau says Alberta's oil price is 'very much a crisis' during Calgary visit
1890 2018-11-22 20:39:21 Product demand collapse - that's what low oil prices are. There are laws that stop governments from interfering in the ability to satisfy demand, governments only establish bare minimum requirements to make developments align with societal expectations. Just rhetoric not risk.
1891 2018-11-22 20:39:15 Or you could suggest that he ensured that two other export pipelines never get built and now holds the cards on what happens with this one all while keeping in mind his objective of “phasing” out the oil sands.

1897 2018-11-22 20:39:02 @RobBreakenridge explain this to me please.When engineers step up and provide a real solution to a problem regarding shipment of oil we get told "Our experts are working  on a solution and will provide more details in the coming months." Are we not experts? Are we insignificant?
1898 2018-11-22 20:38:52 Fun fact: 

Did you know coconut oil has in 12-carbon lauric acid that naturally kills bacteria, virus and fungi? 

Great idea for you skin and “other areas” to keep healthy
1899 2018-11-22 20:38:50 At least ur not using palm oil
1900 2018-11-22 20:38:46 We had the extinguisher ready before we even got the oil out! Good looks Barry! Bless my friend and happy thanksgiving! I am thankful to have connected with you,  and so many other fam. Thank you for being here!
1901 2018-11-22 20:38:44 Secondly, if Canada does supply you 40% of your oil why do you really care? Canada is the USAs strongest ally id argue other then maybe Russia  (don’t get salty kids). Canada I would say atleast has always been one of the USAs bigger/biggest ally 2/3
1902 2018-11-22 20:38:42 Wow, never seen that! In Switzerland they don't eat turkey and special not cooked in hot oil.  Looks awesome 
1903 2018-11-22 20:38:34 Has PM got a deal of palm oil on deferred payment?
1904 2018-11-22 20:38:27 Let’s celebrate colonizing North America by over indulging. Meanwhile people are starving and we are building oil pipelines over the biggest groundwater aquifer in the country, which just so happens to be located on indigenous peoples sacred land. Happy fucking thanksgiving.
1905 2018-11-22 20:38:24 Pass on this take 

Gives credence to the false claim that giving MBS a pass actually affected oil prices. It is a ridiculous assertion 

If the President could magically dial oil prices up or down, there's no way that he would have had them in the 70's the wk before midterms
1906 2018-11-22 20:38:21 Why don’t you look up how 10 of Africa counties gets it’s oil out! Why is it someone have to look up your stupidity? Afghanistan,Czechoslovakia,Switzerland’s, and on and on.
International law of free access, dumbass
1907 2018-11-22 20:38:21 It's called temporary survival. Hope Canadians realize that Putin/Trump are attempting to gain Control of Oil Reserves across the World, including Canada, via the Conservatives.
Russia's Ukraine incursion, backing Syria. Ransom the World! Let it sink in!
1908 2018-11-22 20:38:21 I live in South Texas. Low oil prices mean lost jobs and repossessed trucks here. How do you feel about this? Should we have protective tariffs, or should we leave it to the market?
1909 2018-11-22 20:38:11 I never said any of that.

What has the Truedeau administration done specifically that has hindered the Oil and Gas industry in Alberta from getting their product out to market?

To my knowledge we currently ship a majority of our crude to Texas and buy it back  on the USD.

Don't add  more fire and oil to the burning soul of your rotten man. Hell is not fun even for a traitor.
1912 2018-11-22 20:37:43 And yet just last week they voted no to the olympics and wanting affordable housing and get our oil to market.  Isn’t that what he’s doing?
1913 2018-11-22 20:37:42 He bought the f...g pipeline to insure its construction!  keep up Andrew! I think we gave enough $ to oil ...how did you ever get to lead the fed pc!!?? Your arguments are childish
1914 2018-11-22 20:37:38 The #PTI government should immediately reverse #oilprices since the Crude Oil barrel has reversed from US $75 to US $53 per barrel within no time. 
Give some space to the general public. #Brentoil #Crudeoil
1915 2018-11-22 20:37:38 Were is the positive change you brought to the common man in 8 years you where there?  Yes the change is for common man not for elites that have looted and still want to continue looting, Buhari say no to oil block sharing to the elites.
Your party PDP can not dualize Suleja road
1916 2018-11-22 20:37:28 Not exclusively because the rand will improve which will reduce import prices including oil.
1917 2018-11-22 20:37:26 These people aren't so bright. Even if you disregard the climate the pipeline is still stupid. China and other Asian countries want to bring in bigger ships, which they can't. As a result they want their oil to come from the US, not Canada. This wont help the Canadian economy.
1918 2018-11-22 20:37:17 Na you know the type of culture of running oil on ones head. 
1919 2018-11-22 20:37:09 I hear what your saying Neil. I'm a painter and use a protective varnish called retouch which protects but also allows the oil painting to cure by allowing it to breath. Of course not the same as stone but just a thought
1920 2018-11-22 20:37:06 I used olive oil which was hella expensive (like buying a quart of Mobil 1) but the results were worth it. I might try peanut oil next year, bet the house will smell like Chick-Fil-A if I do ha ha
1921 2018-11-22 20:37:00 Just some advice.
NEVER use water on a grease / oil fire.
Keep a tight fitting lid handy when frying.
Powdery substances (flour / sugar) can be used to smother a grease fire.
Buy a fire extinguisher.
1922 2018-11-22 20:36:59 I'm feeling you, but most lubricants are made of oil, and oil displaces water.. much like the hydrocarbons in wd-40...

1938 2018-11-22 20:35:45 Saudi Arabia need to sell oil as much as we need to buy it,!! The America's are the least threatened by what happens in the middle east, profit before principal's is very unchristian and the rest of the world is being driven towards reassessing their loyalties.
1939 2018-11-22 20:35:38 Put a few drops  of lavender oil in if you have an. Very calming and smells lovely.
1940 2018-11-22 20:35:36 I see data all over the map for gas prices , some say they are higher than ever, and others say they are lower, before using averages, you should know the standard dev. I’m guessing high tax states , not the cost of oil is driving Mr. Klaas’s Statement.
1941 2018-11-22 20:35:28 A short term strategy would be to invite oil pipeline corps to leverage an adjacent route to the recently approved LNG Canada pipeline running from Dawson Creek to Kitimat.  Make that route an approved energy corridor.

Then resolve the TMX issues for a 2nd route to market.
1942 2018-11-22 20:35:17 Oil slumping down rigorously without any real pullback.Ain't it becoming too easy and predictable. Mr Market hardly gives so easy guesses

1. Are his socks cool?
2. Is his hair perfect so he looks good in the selfies he claims he doesn't take?

He won't get the message.

If the oil industry workers were predominantly Syrian refugees, he'd build the pipeline tomorrow.

1949 2018-11-22 20:34:26 I don't understand your reply? You rather have your oil shipped to the USA or the far east? I am sure Eastern Canada would pay you more if your oil was properly refined.
1950 2018-11-22 20:34:25 Ramp up taxes on fossil fuels, invest in nuclear for baseload electricity, invest in fusion research, invest heavily in solar and wind, and crucially stop burning oil and gas, and stop industry lobbying governments to burn oil and gas.

1959 2018-11-22 20:33:43 It’s a shame that the follow up made so little news.  The real scandal was conservative groups were guilty of not paying taxes more than liberal groups, but both sides were targeted for investigation.

1964 2018-11-22 20:33:26 Yeah, I see that rice in '99 is the new benchmark and excuse for Buhari's incompetence!!

How much was oil in' 99 please?

Did we enter recession because of it?
1965 2018-11-22 20:33:24 Still a bonus when you get 40% of it directly through pipelines at less than $15 a barrel, sure helps keep costs down more than Saudi oil
1966 2018-11-22 20:33:21 Just like our old pal @DuncanCastles ok taking oil money when it suits
1967 2018-11-22 20:33:21 I have no reason to suspect I am important. I am a cog in a huge mechanism, struggling on despite a shortage of oil, engineers, spare parts and time to fix it. BUT, and here’s the kicker, I’m a good cog. I’ve got years of working in me, if the operators would just let me work.
1968 2018-11-22 20:33:21 Not just crude. Even currency has changed from around 75 to 70+. Government & oil companies are making fool of the nation, clearly. Shame on @narendramodi ji & @BJP4India for this stupidity.
1969 2018-11-22 20:33:10 There is a lot of oil in the golf regions
1970 2018-11-22 20:33:04 Can’t come second after Chrissy Teigans insta story where I physically want to eat my phone and then go onto dry turkey in a foil tin without so much as a drizzling of olive oil and just a bit of salt and pepper. The bare basics. Your millionaires. Shame on you all.
1971 2018-11-22 20:33:01 Am I the only one who finds it morbidly ironic that an OIL COMPANY sponsored the dinosaur balloon in the #MacysThanksgivingDayParade or...?
1972 2018-11-22 20:32:57 Stupid question. Does it take longer to do a deep fried turkey when it’s 20 degrees outside? Oil took forever to heat up
1973 2018-11-22 20:32:52 an alberta based oil corporation or one of their well funded lobby groups. Suits & Boots, OSCA, CAPP. I'm sure Vivian would know, but she never answers questions, she just asks loaded ones.
1974 2018-11-22 20:32:51 OPEC controls the oil
1975 2018-11-22 20:32:45 Yes there were no women there james !
you make a gay of it,
1976 2018-11-22 20:32:40 The country moving towards green/renewable energy sources doesn't prohibit it from having oil as a revenue stream. The manufacture of plastics-based consumer goods isn't going to go away any time remotely soon, for example.
1977 2018-11-22 20:32:34 What is it with Corker?  People’s jobs could be on the line due to exploding oil prices and he has to jab at POTUS with his sophomoric responses.
1978 2018-11-22 20:32:33 Has anyone heard if Mueller called Rex Tillerson in? There must be a story with Putin, Rosneft Oil, Tillerson, Exxon + Cheeto.
1979 2018-11-22 20:32:29 Not complicated and I can make my own mind up thank you! I don't buy products which contain palm oil. Nor do I buy products from various large corporates whose practices I don't like.
1980 2018-11-22 20:32:28 ok, I start with cancelled Northern Gateway and TMX, that alone has hurt Alberta oil workers alot, let's continue with no help for Alberta during recession, unlike Quebec milk farmers and Bombardier, shall I continue or you have counter argument?
1981 2018-11-22 20:32:24 NOW you want our tax $ to solve your problem.  The world oil price does not even come close to enable making $ in Alta without a lot of subsidy. Albertans used to be against that.
1982 2018-11-22 20:32:22 Albertans aren't dealing with steep discounts. Oil companies are, our Province has the fastest growing economy in Canada. Enough with the fear mongering
1983 2018-11-22 20:32:21 This was nothing but a smoke screen. The Liberals need everyone taking about this rather than more pressing issues like the debt and oil related problems.

1989 2018-11-22 20:31:40 So if Alberta oil is selling at a big discount, and Asian markets are so hot for dilbit that our gov't is investing $10B+ into TMX, then why aren't Asian-bound tankers departing Westridge Terminal TODAY? 

To be clear, the TM pipeline has tidewater access TODAY.

1992 2018-11-22 20:31:06 Neuquén ya suma 34 concesiones no convencionales en #VacaMuerta. Las últimas dos, desde hoy: Vista Oil en Bajada de Palo Este (197,7 km2 de superficie; piloto de u$s53 MM y 5 pozos) y Oeste (253 km2; 8 pozos, u$s105,6 MM ). Vista va hacia los 65 mil BOE en 5 años. #Shale

Either way, this is good.
I just use the oil.

2000 2018-11-22 20:30:36 I’m not desperate at all.  I’m just wondering why an anti-oil protester gets appointed to environment minister in a province that relies on oil, and how that indicates support for the industry?
2001 2018-11-22 20:30:30 Some people are too lazy to go there and spill their household grease/motor oil/paint/etc down the drain. More significantly, many businesses have their effluent monitored for the presence of a variety of substances.
2002 2018-11-22 20:30:27 Tens of millions of dollars funneled into Canada via foreign based environmental groups in order to keep our oil landlocked and the best you can do is ask who paid for some signage?
2003 2018-11-22 20:30:26 You don’t have to pay companies to chop rainforest down just to get parm oil and even though you said it’s ‘sustainable’ well no one can believe anything these days and you can get parm oil without cutting rainforest down #greenpeace #WWF #TimeToChange

Y'know how cheese'll separate into a thin sort of oil, and some more sludgey material? You can keep
2006 2018-11-22 20:30:04 This is dumb. We didn’t “assassinate Hussein” because he killed his own people. We invaded his country under false pretenses to control the oil reserves and put him on trial.

2013 2018-11-22 20:29:42 Yes, you are done. Your phony Paris Agreement is flypaper. Texas is bringing millions of new barrels of oil onto the market at cheap prices. China and India are bringing huge new coal capacity online.

You lost, sir. If you want to be a gentleman about it, fine. If not, fine.
2014 2018-11-22 20:29:37 But yes, oil. (Horrible excuse.)
2015 2018-11-22 20:29:29 You can bet that if they found oil or uranium there, someone would be along to dig it up in no time.

2017 2018-11-22 20:29:21 You’re right, we need to improve offtake for gas as well. In the 90’s/2000’s natural gas royalties were higher, but oil royalties took over in the last decade. We need both #ableg

2025 2018-11-22 20:28:51 I was going to use oil but that’s for the recommendation. Butter is healthier.
2026 2018-11-22 20:28:48 Once again... Try to get Canadian owned Upgraders in Alberta and then open Energy East... Eastern Canada should not to give its money to the USA and Saudi for its oil...WE WANT ALBERTA OIL!!! Please..
2027 2018-11-22 20:28:46 Dude. It doesn’t matter who we buy from. It’s a commodity traded on the open market. If Saudi cuts production oil prices go up all over, not just for Saudi oil. We can’t buy cheaper from someone else just because they are not Saudi
2028 2018-11-22 20:28:45 It kinda smelt like fire burnt tbh but was just bc my housemate didn’t clean the frypan properly I think and the oil left in there as soon as I turned on like smoked up

2044 2018-11-22 20:27:06 The Norwegians in the 80s decided it was the people’s oil and for future generations too. They started an oil fund which is currently invested in many places and currently the interest earns them 4 times their GDP.
We on the other hand squandered the oil revenues raised.

2048 2018-11-22 20:26:51 But you have to use plenty oil..

2051 2018-11-22 20:26:43 Oil more expensive under Trump than it was under Obama

Trump again cost us money
2052 2018-11-22 20:26:41 Are you saying 40 years of conservative rule had nothing to do with the development of the oil and gas industry in Alberta.
2053 2018-11-22 20:26:41 stop washing them in the dishwasher #1, if it isn't chipped you can clean it up on a stone or a wet wheel and then sharpen & oil it.

2057 2018-11-22 20:25:58 Obama did get it wrong on the health plan claim, and he has said many times he regrets the statement.  Trump lies all the time - sometimes several times daily - and NEVER says he is sorry when his statements are shown to be false.  (Want examples?)
2058 2018-11-22 20:25:57 Crocodile tears. Trudeau family discriminated against the West for years. Took their oil revenues to pay for Liberal seats in Quebec, forcing Western Canada to pay for MPs who vote against the West's interests.

2059 2018-11-22 20:25:57 i would support oil at 150 a barrell if that was the result of gutting the saudi relationship even if what he said is true
2060 2018-11-22 20:25:54 Think you’ve all been misinformed, Dubai isn’t like this at all! You won’t get arrested for holding hands, showing legs/shoulders. Out of respect for them it’d be nice if you didn’t, but people do! Locals are in hotel bars having a drink Oil is running out, tourism is needed.
2061 2018-11-22 20:25:44 It's not enough coconut oil until you're too slippery to put the lid back on.
2062 2018-11-22 20:25:36 Who cares about women's rights anyway? If you get cheap oil why not ignore human-rights violations & the most extreme interpretation of Islam? Theres only any point in you moaning about what women can wear and do in countries where you are allowed to make you films right Katie?
2063 2018-11-22 20:25:31 What is the typical cost of an oil analysis?

However, the ADA notes that there have been no scientific studies to prove its benefits. Consult a dentist for all your dental hygiene questions. #dentist
2077 2018-11-22 20:24:10 But at least Trump gets his oil and stocks. God damn psychopath.

2079 2018-11-22 20:23:46 PM Trudeau says he feels frustration of Albertans. He says oil price differential is a "real problem." #yyc #ableg #cdnpoli
2080 2018-11-22 20:23:42 We don’t have a free market with oil, we are stuck with one customer as we have no access to the global market. We are being held hostage by those who want to keep our oil landlocked.
2081 2018-11-22 20:23:35 Brush it off, re-coat in oil, wrap in foil, then put in oven on self cleaning cycle for a couple hours. I use the grate you saw. But I do have an extra.
2082 2018-11-22 20:23:34 Should we rethink the situation with Saudi Arabia. So let's get in a pissing match with Saudi Arabia.  Oil prices go thru the roof.  The world economics go into the trash.  So over one Saudi journalist we should turn the world upside down? That's what the globalist want. Then
2083 2018-11-22 20:23:34 See fool, nothing to fall back to in a country that is producing 2.2million barel of oil per day. See your life out side
2084 2018-11-22 20:23:32 i put coconut oil all over my body today, very thankful

2086 2018-11-22 20:23:10 Thanks mate, I have tried wet brine, dry brine and no brine. Best results have always been with no brine, as long as it's a decent turkey it's full of flavour! Bit of oil, salt and 90 minutes spinning on the rotisserie, no drama! The kids inhaled it so it must have been good!

2094 2018-11-22 20:22:22 Jonathan porritt says we should promote the use of sustainable oil. Does it count to support this if you drive a 10yr old Shogun?
2095 2018-11-22 20:22:05 No one is buying right now.  There is an oil glut that will maintain for quite a while.  The glut is cause by the oil industry itself.
2096 2018-11-22 20:21:57 Literally from the effects of the Obama administration. And fuels dropping because we just found a massive oil bed in Texas. No shit.
2097 2018-11-22 20:21:57 I have it in oil form, haven't used it for ages but was brilliant when I needed it for anxiety
2098 2018-11-22 20:21:56 But, what about all the stories claiming independence from needing Saudi oil? Since Saudi oil only accounts for 11% of our oil, what's wrong with your statement?
2099 2018-11-22 20:21:55 In my oven the roast parsnips on;y take 20 mins if that, so I watch them like a hawk. Was well pleased with them tonight - baby parsnip chips mmmmm, roasted in olive oil. My kitchen  was in complete disarray though.

2103 2018-11-22 20:21:47 Saudi Arabia isnt even the US's largest supplier of oil. You get most of your oil from your own country and Canada. Nice try though. Best to attempt q different way of excusing doing business with murderers and terrorists . This arguement sucks
2104 2018-11-22 20:21:47 They haven’t ‘banned’ palm oil, they just aren’t using it
2105 2018-11-22 20:21:40 Uranium One was no scandal.  Shepherd Smith laid out all the objective facts in the link I shared ON FOX!  Again, it was a stupid distraction.
2106 2018-11-22 20:21:39 Global climate change is pushing, Inupiaq, Gwich’in and Yupik communities to relocate. Fossil fuels cause global climate change and oil companies are driven by profit. Capitalism IS at fault.
2107 2018-11-22 20:21:33 When it's cheaper than petroleum, but the oil is not depleted... There are many other reasons...
2108 2018-11-22 20:21:20 I think my coconut oil pie crust is a bit of a disaster but it's an OK pie as long as the filling is good (and it is).
2109 2018-11-22 20:21:03 Does any other country sell oil at a discount?  #bigoilwinsagain
2110 2018-11-22 20:20:57 صح لسانك يا السمي
2111 2018-11-22 20:20:53 Try “The Big Easy” by @Charbroil. No oil but same kind of taste.
2112 2018-11-22 20:20:49 Only about 17k jobs rely on Saudi contracts! With unemployment at only 3% per Trump, replacement jobs should be easy to find! We don’t need Saudi oil, so cut ties with them !
2113 2018-11-22 20:20:31 We DON’T need the Saudi oil.  Be nicer to Canada who provides 40% of our oil.  You are really a mental lightweight.
2114 2018-11-22 20:20:31 @Ekpo98292241, I concur that the economy is not doing too good, @MBuhari, will certainly be blamed, since he was the president when the economy went into recession

Nigeria is an import dependant country, we get our FX from crude oil exports and use the FX to import anything
2115 2018-11-22 20:20:13 Today, neocolonialism vía oil drilling, mining, agriculture, etc is exploiting the land and making Indigenous communities sick.

2118 2018-11-22 20:20:09 My question: between GDP contribution of 10-12%   and export revenue contribution of 95% which is more likely to induce recession if altered negatively? Bearing in  mind that the price of the same oil wasn’t up to $50 between 1999-2007. #GNWA #TheAtikuPlan
2119 2018-11-22 20:19:57 Garlic, Olive oil , and pine nut sauce would make that the best dish
2120 2018-11-22 20:19:52 Well what a tangled Trump web woven. Trumps embrace of Saudis wasnt for oil, it was for HIS  tv network, FOX. FIRST Sinclair teams with Commies, and now FOX with Saudis. What an effing attack on democracy!
2121 2018-11-22 20:19:49 By building a pipeline so that we have the export capacity and our oil is no longer discounted in price? 
2122 2018-11-22 20:19:38 A question, maybe obvious, but was David Brent named after the oil index? on the stock exchange. If so, doubly hilarious. The Office was great, but Derek was moving on so many levels, and had kindness.
2123 2018-11-22 20:19:37 If oil was triple in price he’d still not condemn.
2124 2018-11-22 20:19:33 I make pumpkin whoopie pies for Thanksgiving every year but this year I used melted butter instead of oil and oh my god this is the best batch I’ve ever made
2125 2018-11-22 20:19:33 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
The price action of WTI tomorrow is likely similar to what happened earlier today. The big moves won't happen until the big boys are coming back to the trading desks Sunday night.
2126 2018-11-22 20:19:32 How is a pipeline more important that affordable housing? People need places to live. Cost of housing across the country is a problem. Sure a pipeline will bring jobs and help the oil industry but that does not encompass everybody in Alberta
2127 2018-11-22 20:19:31 If you truly believe that then say bye bye to oil, some banks, GM, ect. FYI green companies are offered incentives. Again, pls provide examples
2128 2018-11-22 20:19:28 President @gejonathan in his book, my transition hour, stated that drop in oil price couldn’t have been the reason for the country going into recession as it contribution to GDP  was 12%. This policy review document, puts it at 10%. #NGWA #TheAtikuPlan
2129 2018-11-22 20:19:27 Never brush and my most recent 2c/3a find? Fractionated coconut oil, minimal odor, minimal greasiness. Can get in pump bottle since it doesn't congeal in cold weather. Mix with leave-in conditioner on clean sopping wet hair.  Then style.
2130 2018-11-22 20:19:23 The USA is a net exporter of oil, so low oil prices actually hurt the overall economy.
2131 2018-11-22 20:19:10 Astrigent, serum, moisturizer, and face oil is an undefeated combo. Skin just glowing right now.
2132 2018-11-22 20:19:05 Olive oil is essential for many of God's ancient peoples. Bless!
2133 2018-11-22 20:19:01 I’m too much of a cheapskate to buy real oil so I use a hand lotion with vitamin e and jojoba oil as the top ingredients fhdndn

2135 2018-11-22 20:18:55 more jobs in US are probably lost to low low oil prices.  Ask #alaska
2136 2018-11-22 20:18:39 Yes, it dropped 70 cents here yesterday for the holiday. But all of these prices are artificially high.  There has been an oil glut for a decade.
2137 2018-11-22 20:18:37 If we give away fish from our grounds why do we not give away oil rights as well. We could also allow Poland to have access to our deep coal reserves. We aren't using it anyway.
2138 2018-11-22 20:18:37 CBD literally is most of the THC (to like..less than 1%) removed from the oil. leaving only the good effects without the high, so of course you didn't feel anything Lol

I ordered some Kratom from that site so I will let you know how it goes :V
2139 2018-11-22 20:18:32 I brined it in salt, lemon, liquid smoke, white wine. My rub was garlic, liquid smoke, brown sugar, salt, smoked paprika, adobo, and a bit of sesame oil. Then I cooked it in the oven at 275F
2140 2018-11-22 20:18:19 You also have to be willing to buy billions in weapons and have influence over the price of oil.  It's not JUST about killing journalists
2141 2018-11-22 20:18:14 @scoutstore1917 - is the Palm Oil in your Christmas Chocolate collection sustainable palm oil? @RSPOtweets #SustainablePalmOil
2142 2018-11-22 20:18:10 do you not realize how much 9% of the total amount of oil we receive is? prices would SKYROCKET your genuinely stupid dont ever tweet please
2143 2018-11-22 20:18:00 You do know that our oil is discounted nearly $40 / BBL due to lack of pipeline capacity right?  Producers are sitting on capital for expansion projects because it's now uneconomical.
2144 2018-11-22 20:17:57 U should get vitamin e oil n try to have it uncovered as much as u can so it can heal quicker! Same shit happened to me at the beginning of summer it was sooo depressing
2145 2018-11-22 20:17:54 Easy mistake, but no the Imperial Oil Building is located up on St Clair. Originally proposed as the new Toronto City Hall, it’s blue prints were rejected by citizens only to be adopted by for the Imperial Oil HQ.
2146 2018-11-22 20:17:42 I fill my vehicle tank to the brim once in 9 or 10 days and I spend close to 20k doing that my Jaguar S-Type uses Automotive Gas Oil and it is N255 per litre at the moment in most filling stations in Lagos since it is not a subsidized product by @NNPCgroup. I survive still.
2147 2018-11-22 20:17:29 one day it will be just me, my freedom and the raft i made out of old pepsi bottles, gently bobbing through the Atlantic until we get stuck in the mucilaginous black sludge of an oil spill an die
2148 2018-11-22 20:17:28 wat's ur hair texture bro? im speaking from my 4c hair, but protective styles-- braidz n twists -- will save ur life! moisture, frequent  conditioner, infrequent shampoo & occasional deep conditions, too (i use avocado oil in the winter time). you gotta trim that dead hair tho
2149 2018-11-22 20:17:24 Bit of exaggeration but given the Deep discount, reality that Oil price is set in the USA & they have guaranteed access (NAFTA) to 3/4's of our resouces. It is True however amount are closer to half of that Number. Fact is #KochbrosCabal & #USOligarchs have a stranglehold on AB
2150 2018-11-22 20:17:23 Not our fault we don't have oil money to steal players away
2151 2018-11-22 20:17:08 Yeah there was something on from CNR Steve Laut I think on BNN about oil storage space with empty “air barrels” to influence prices.  He complained we are paying 80 to 100 million dollarettes each day, no wonder my wallet is so light
2152 2018-11-22 20:17:04 @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley  The Alberta Tories had decades and you and Harper had a clear 10 year shot to get a pipe to Canadian tidewater Jason and failed miserably. You guys that are the ones responsible for Alberta getting screwed over on the price of oil, no one else.
2153 2018-11-22 20:16:52 Learn some economics world glut of oil is the reason for lower prices not you all you have done is side with a murderer
2154 2018-11-22 20:16:51 Saudis have been a thorn for years. If it wasn’t for the oil, they would have been glass by now. We can’t and shouldn’t trust them. Let alone arm them.
2155 2018-11-22 20:16:42 I’m a huge supporter of yours Mr. President but you’re gonna put all of us oilfield people out of work with this!!! Oil prices can’t be super low!  They don’t have to be high either!  They’re has to be a medium where we can still make a living! MAGA and the oilfield
2156 2018-11-22 20:16:32 @realDonaldTrump Mr. President. I hope you know that higher oil prices actually stimulates our economy. I work in the Bakken. If oil prices continue to fall they will begin laying off thousands of workers.
2157 2018-11-22 20:16:29 BLACK FRIDAY SALE! 

Tomorrow only! Buy one 375ml olive oil or 375ml balsamic vinegar and get a 200ml for half price!
2158 2018-11-22 20:16:28 It’s either this, this, this or this. It might be the oil actually, yeah it’s definitley the oil.
2159 2018-11-22 20:16:24 Alberta realize that Putin,Trump are attempting to gain control of Oil Reserves across the World, including Canada, via the Conservatives = UPC Jason Kenney  

Russia's Ukraine incursion, backing Syria. Putin wants his pipeline to dominate Europe! #abpoli
2160 2018-11-22 20:16:21 While other families probably talk about politics, mine talks about CBD oil and trying to open a dispensary lmao
2161 2018-11-22 20:16:07 Dear Mr. Trump:  People buy and sell oil based on market conditions, i.e. supply and demand.  To my understanding, American oil production was already trending upwards when you took office.  Maybe your policies increased the supply a little, but you can't take much credit.
2162 2018-11-22 20:16:02 4 the fact that this president continue on the path of lies through you people, he must loose the next election.... can u state the specific period of the past 16 years that oil sold for $140/barrel ...@GarShehu  mind u at dec 2014 crude sold for less than $50/barrel below budget
2163 2018-11-22 20:15:46 First Bank, union Bank, Conoil, Oando, Forte oil, Notore  etc were all once owned by government but privatization changed their fortune, Government has no business managing a business, it should only be a regulator.90% of NNPC operations are business and support its privatization
2164 2018-11-22 20:15:46 A few 1st nation communities not all must be emphasized. Shipping AB & SK oil to foreign markets in pipelines in itself doesn't endanger natural habitats. It is the potential risk if a spill that makes people nervous. That risk is minimized through design, maintenance & response.
2165 2018-11-22 20:15:43 We're supposed to be moving away from oil Michael, not building an economy from it.
2166 2018-11-22 20:15:40 By the way, Norway is the 7° largerst oil producer of the world.
And stop believe in CNN.
noone of these countries are socialists.
Just pooring Countries.
2167 2018-11-22 20:15:39 It's landlocked. The US can get their oil to the world markets but Canada can't because of Justin. He's cancelled four pipelines.
2168 2018-11-22 20:15:38 Damn..... how hot do you have the peanut oil? 
2169 2018-11-22 20:15:19 You forgot to give the option of getting rid of the corrupt technology suppressing oil companies & to make them pay huge fines to pay for the damage their corruption has caused, fines so huge to completely wipe their profits & bankrupt them, please add that option.
2170 2018-11-22 20:15:19 I dont know. We can only hope that when we reach peak oil something cataclysmic happens.
2171 2018-11-22 20:15:16 @Morning_Joe I figured out who trump is going to get in the SNATCH  & GRAB, the OIL - RON.  (YEMAN) THIS IS about trump's pocket.
2172 2018-11-22 20:15:14 This is why they didn't want us to succeed. This is the fear of the West realized. Africans making their own deals, today in peace and tomorrow in buisness . The oil, rubber, diamond, cocoa, coffee, uranium will not be parceled out by the US,UK and EU.

My husband is hardly ever home and Thanksgiving is supposed to be a day with family...... but no.... he’s now at your store buying half priced oil..... your poor employees. I hope you paid em well.  #BlackFriday not Th.
2181 2018-11-22 20:14:29 The most consistent entity is the historical and continued unethical conduct of the Saudi government. That is easily observable on a daily basis. There is only one reason that thugs like Trump smile at Saudi and that's oil. Not because they actually like the Saudi Gvt.
2182 2018-11-22 20:14:29 Please stick to football.  Nothing as hilarious as an NFL pundit arguing macroeconomics.  Dude you are clueless.  Do you realize it doesn’t matter where the oil comes from?  SA could put the price of oil at 150 a barrel in 6 months if they wanted to.

2199 2018-11-22 20:12:22 Norway! Is that not the small independent country in Northern Europe that got to keep their own oil as well?
2200 2018-11-22 20:12:21 You missed the point: THIS particular survey was among professionnals who work for Big oil (in Alberta), it wasn't a survey of the scientific community at large. They were obviously biased by their paycheck to find non-human causes to climate change.
2201 2018-11-22 20:12:20 Oh, poor thing.....hate hate hate kids suffering with it. 

Coconut oil didn't work for me. I am open to giving things a go, just depends on what it is.

2202 2018-11-22 20:12:16 I do not feel Donald has any other viable options except to cooperate with these people so we all have oil. DIPLOMACY is always better than war and needless bloodshed. Saudi's are cruel and they do not need to be. I do not understand...I think Donald is handling it appropriately.
2203 2018-11-22 20:12:12 I've also heard we use an inordinate amnt of our oil (and gas?) from Canada, but we should keep in mind that the USA now produces more oil than any other country in the world... abt 12mil bbls weekly

2208 2018-11-22 20:11:49 Happy Thanksgiving, the day americans conveniently forget that last year American Indians were tortured for protecting their land from an oil pipeline which this year is spilling already onto that same reserve.

2211 2018-11-22 20:11:21 People who want to diversify away from oil, should stop for a minute, look around and see that they are surrounded be an environment of a good quality life supported and provided for and by oil, just about everything is derived from oil, step back into the stone age then

It is part of the natural carbon cycle & doesn't introduce sequestered carbon into the atmosphere as coal, oil & gas do. So the CO2 impact is neutral despite emissions.

2219 2018-11-22 20:10:39 You know, you guys can just say we don’t want to stop selling oil at any cost, and not look like dumbfucks
2220 2018-11-22 20:10:26 You are not responsible for lower gas $$ + neither is SA. They only own about 25% of the world's oil. + you certainly haven't caused any traffic jams either. You are so full of yourself.  Be aware of karma, who is a very nasty biatch. "she" is watching you.
2221 2018-11-22 20:10:24 Were the number 1 oil exporter on the planet now. Gas prices going down isn’t from you being pals with a man who ordered the murder of an innocent, it’s from us driving it down at our own will. What a dickhead.
2222 2018-11-22 20:10:20 Norway has $1Trillion saved in the bank from oil royalties.  Alberta has a giant pile of toxic waste that will cost trillions to clean up.  All the money was siphoned off by corporations who lobbied for low taxes, almost zero royalties and lax regulations.  Thanks Alberta!
2223 2018-11-22 20:10:19 These sorts of articles are good for "business." They are self perpetuating. But they are NOT good for America, who is incredibly gullable and misinformed about our oil future. As POTUS said recently, we no longer need to conserve our nation's oil. That's dangerous stuff to say.

2227 2018-11-22 20:10:03 ああ、これはまずい。実にまずい。0.1トン超えたよ。
2228 2018-11-22 20:09:59 This is a false premise. The US produces more crude oil than SA. And the US bus more oil from Canada than SA. The Saudis don't control the price of a global commodity.  Please don't give it air.
2229 2018-11-22 20:09:55 Agreed. Besides, Saudi Arabia provides only 11% of our oil while Canada provides 40%. Stop buying any oil from SA and our gas price might go up 30 cents.  I’ll pay that all day to punish SA. Or stop selling them military equipment. Hard to replace with China or Russia quickly.

2234 2018-11-22 20:09:33 We don't like your president but we're no fools we know most of US citezens also don't. Rasing our oil price might just make a point on Trump's base and let them see the lies. Besides he wanted fair trade with us and to my knowlage US still has a surplus and keep steel  tarrifs
2235 2018-11-22 20:09:31 jesus it's so cold in my apartment today i lit the emergency oil lamp because it makes a surprisingly good space heater
2236 2018-11-22 20:09:31 I made roasted potatoes with garlic and olive oil.  I went a little overboard on the garlic. They came out awesome but... The house and us are now warded against vampires. Possibly forever.
2237 2018-11-22 20:09:16 Or say if an oil company worked out it could make more profits by not drilling for oil that would make its existence pointless.

2241 2018-11-22 20:09:02 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.

2243 2018-11-22 20:08:56 Of course they've been higher. But they were $2.95 here in KY a week ago when I bought gas, and they were around $2.20 the last year @BarackObama was in office. Nowhere can I find the story Trump refers to. Cover for Saudi arms deals. There's been an oil glut years.
#FauxNews
2244 2018-11-22 20:08:55 Y'all really walking around without jackets, outside , to show off your outfit? Lawd. Better throw some coconut oil in ya mole right away.
2245 2018-11-22 20:08:39 No, I was going to actually but when I got the rocker cover replaced/gaskets, I got a new CCV anyway and it’ll last a while. The M54 burns oil mainly due to the piston rings shrinking so it burns it annoyingly. The M54TU engines are actually better tbh
2246 2018-11-22 20:08:38 Great job Mr President
Oil prices down because of your support of the US Oil industry
2247 2018-11-22 20:08:28 So funny how thesevtrolls for the oil industry forget that Alberta is about a lot more than oil. And that government isn't here to do the bidding of private, and often foreign owned, businesses.
2248 2018-11-22 20:08:26 楽しんできてください～(*´▽｀)
2249 2018-11-22 20:08:23 Jobs and oil over human lives....typical Trump!
2250 2018-11-22 20:08:14 Oh so you refuse to condemn Saudi Arabia for the MURDER of an American journalist and in return they temporarily lower the price of oil!! GREAT JOB!!! Maybe if you let them MURDER more Americans the price of gas will drop under $1 a gallon! Keep up the good work!!
2251 2018-11-22 20:08:05 That is brilliant Kassio ..i never spotted that.
What a picture. Made my evening

2253 2018-11-22 20:07:49 DPS can't do a thing. Having an oil massage in hair is a must before any marriage ritual in South India. Shampooing it off frowned upon.
Hello Rohini, hope you are well and all your problems have been solved.
2254 2018-11-22 20:07:43 What does this prove, exactly? Is it that the Saudis don't matter? They give us 9% of our oil imports, which was around 11 billion gallons of oil in 2017. I don't see your point here. Those 262 million barrels a year do obviously matter.
2255 2018-11-22 20:07:39 I have an actifry, so I usually make my veg in that. So easy. One teaspoon of oil (I use coconut) to loads of veg. And they turn out yum!
2256 2018-11-22 20:07:38 America is thankful for $18 oil from Canada.
2257 2018-11-22 20:07:36 No, but I did graduate with a physics degree from Harvard, and I know how scientific consensus works. The 2-3% of "scientists" that supposedly deny global warming are obviously being bribed by big oil.  No real scientists deny humans are responsible for climate change.
2258 2018-11-22 20:07:24 That wild growth oil really grew my cut out within 5 months  it’s hair crack
2259 2018-11-22 20:07:17 I don't think it's late to teach law. Oil and Gas law is a course you could teach drawing from experiences in the courtroom and dealing with clients within that sphere.
2260 2018-11-22 20:07:15 You know i am too right. Cook the meat and mushrooms with butter, sear the tomatoes in a cast iron with a little olive oil, fanfuckingtastic
2261 2018-11-22 20:07:12 @realDonaldTrump dropped into a Saudi Arabian bank this week and helped prepare a deposit for the Saudi King.

You guys are doing such a great job killing our Journalists, I'm so proud of you all.

Please keep Oil prices low, it's making me look good.
2262 2018-11-22 20:07:11 I know this is impossible but I wish consumers had a way to identify and choose not support Saudi oil.
2263 2018-11-22 20:07:10 I'm grateful today for many things. One of them is CBD oil. It has helped calm me during these shitty, shitty, shitty times.
2264 2018-11-22 20:06:54 Guess what? Oil revenue isn't the only thing that pays.

Oil, gas. mining and quarrying are only 9% of our GDP. That includes Hibernia and other non-AB sources.

So I guess I'll drive on the roads the other 91% pay for.
2265 2018-11-22 20:06:54 Me too...I think they've just been told the entertainment is a massive game of chess. Look at the floor
2266 2018-11-22 20:06:49 Make sure Brian Topp knows that as he advocated so ardently against the oil industry most of his career.
2267 2018-11-22 20:06:43 Wow my Uncle just offered me a job on winter break measuring oil tanks and it pays $18 and hour and I get overtime and I get to drive a company truck, as if I wasn’t feeling blessed enough already today. SO FREAKING BLESSED MAN
2268 2018-11-22 20:06:36 One Fork ? One pint of beer ? You decide 
2269 2018-11-22 20:06:35 i was searching up “is coconut oil a good moisturizer” and instead what popped up was “is coconut oil a good lube”. what goes on
2270 2018-11-22 20:06:33 Unrefined coconut oil will lower your blood sugar level.
2271 2018-11-22 20:06:28 BTW, it was the Imperial Oil building.
2272 2018-11-22 20:06:27 This ‘bozo’ didn’t start that. If Saudi Arabia stop trading oil in dollars it becomes another violet (and illegal) war or the dollar loses all value.  Google what the petrodollar is.  Your hero violently attacked 5 countries in the Middle East?  Why?
2273 2018-11-22 20:06:04 朝から電車で行って間に合うので、伊勢からさいたまは近い。

2275 2018-11-22 20:05:52 9% of our oil comes from Saudi....I mean surely he’s not putting Trump Inc in front of American interest right?  #americaFirst #maga
2276 2018-11-22 20:05:30  do you remember that commercial about "oil or cream?" (ie coolwip or rediwhip) for pie topping? Oil/coolwip All. The. Way!

2278 2018-11-22 20:05:16 You need partners who have resources - oil. US is a major consumer of oil from middle east! If they impose sanctions, where will they get their oil?
2279 2018-11-22 20:05:15 Nothing sadder than putting too much oil in ur brow pomade
2280 2018-11-22 20:05:06 Here is a news flash for you Spencer : pipelines won't magically raise the price we get for Alberta tar oil. #abpoli
2281 2018-11-22 20:05:04 You get cheap oil cause you buy most of it from Canada almost for free
2282 2018-11-22 20:05:01 @GarShehu  for the fact that this president continues to propagate lies through you people he must loose the next election.....Can you state in which period in specific terms when crude oil sold for $140 /barrel..... i
2283 2018-11-22 20:04:57 Saudi supplies 11% of our oil. Canada supplies 40%
2284 2018-11-22 20:04:57 Yes, Jojoba oil for the win
2285 2018-11-22 20:04:50 It's okay to murder our U.S. journalists, so long as you keep gas below $2.75 a gallon. Thanks for that.
Talk about blood for oil.
2286 2018-11-22 20:04:42 Trump negotiated the new trade deal, lower rates on crude oil. 
Fact, check, and done!
2287 2018-11-22 20:04:40 from what has just been said on @Channel4News the fishing minister has just sold the fishing industry down the river (He should resign!) and the former EU negotiator says the PM is selling snake oil (shes got to go too) and the deal has to be rejected, its not a deal!
2288 2018-11-22 20:04:35 It's true - things are getting worse. We have a politician with a history of bungles and lying, who couldn't manage a  portfolio in a majority govt but imagines he can lead a province, pretending he can fix the oil issue.

He knows he can't, but pretending will get him votes.
2289 2018-11-22 20:04:31 me: ...

dad: 

don’t say it
don’t say it
don’t say it
don’t say it
don’t say it
don’t say it

“don’t forget to check the oil in your car & always get it changed on time”
2290 2018-11-22 20:04:29 Oil prices aren't low because there's a global fear of recession. They're low because of the quid pro quo between this administration & MSB.
2291 2018-11-22 20:04:27 Don’t get lost in numbers, think of it in practical terms. think of it as oil or peanut butter jar. #forex
2292 2018-11-22 20:04:25 Reckon his advisers have told him FED are itching to increase interest rates which will kill credit / money flow. So he's using oil to try and drag down inflation which will mitigate FED risk....weaken dollar and help exports which are being stiffled by strong US$
2293 2018-11-22 20:04:24 A Canadian LD just secured an ongoing monthly supply of 15 tonnes of GMP cannabinoid extracts; 5000kg of each THC, CBD, and CBN, recurring monthly, from one of our JV subsidiaries abroad.
Even if they have issues with Canadian imports they will redirect oil to their EU operation.
2294 2018-11-22 20:04:07 it makes me laugh just looking at it.
2295 2018-11-22 20:04:07 I would like to see us quit burning oil.
2296 2018-11-22 20:04:00 Oil production in the United States expanded during President Obama term in office. But I guess being a Trump lover you prefer alternative facts (a trump administration term)
2297 2018-11-22 20:03:57 I guess it has nothing to do with oil prices dropping, OPEC is on a wobble ATM, America has stockpiled more oil than ever before in its history. Yet Gas prices remain high? Look at the amount of tax the govt take! Trump takes all positives as his
2298 2018-11-22 20:03:51 It's not like Alberta has zero pipelines. We've got lots already. It's political parties like UCP trying to win voters with fear. Oil companies know shale oil is cheaper to refine. Bottom dollar is all its about. Plus Trump MAGA. #cdnpoli
2299 2018-11-22 20:03:43 Yeah...I know ...what happened after that...globally?...the crude oil prices ?.. in-flow of dollars to this country  reduced...coupled with Niger-Delta avengers..we produced less than 1m barrels per day...cos scarcity of dollars.. so the noises should not be about Apc alone...

Well, that was a disappointing program.  The highlight was the late caller who talked about how special interests were imposing policy. Pot : kettle.  Oil industry looking to increase profits while the whole world population at risk from #ClimateChange.
2309 2018-11-22 20:03:12 I cooked an onion in some olive oil on the stove & when the onions we're translucent I added the chickpeas (I made 2 cans to 1 onion)  and toasted them for 1-3 minutes and then added the buffalo sauce until heated. Then serve! Super easy and delicious, the leftovers are great too
2310 2018-11-22 20:03:11 Olive oil, bread crumbs, seasonings took me 25 minutes.
2311 2018-11-22 20:03:10 Heard of oil pulling? The latest craze in oral care, which involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth, has many proponents. However, the ADA notes that there have been no scientific studies to prove its benefits. Consult a dentist for all your dental hygiene questions. #dentist

2315 2018-11-22 20:02:54 Am I?  Feel free to show me where I’m wrong.  Our dollar is backed by something other than countries like Saudi Arabia only trading oil in dollars?  We don’t violently overthrow regimes that decide to stop?  What’s the value of our dollar if SA (subsequently others) stop?  
2316 2018-11-22 20:02:49 he forgot to add 'because you rely on oil"
2317 2018-11-22 20:02:45 Why not stop supply of oil altogether. Result will be zero pollution and zero import bill. You people are amazing!

2322 2018-11-22 20:02:25 @IcelandFoods I was impressed with your operation when BBC ran a programme on it but a huge BRAVO to you for waking us up to the destruction caused by palm oil being used in so many products. The advert may have been banned but the message was received and you deserve credit.
2323 2018-11-22 20:02:23 How much gdp does journalism add to our economy versus oil and gas sector. And money is not only thing required, government and regulatory support is key as well

2330 2018-11-22 20:01:43 Do you remember this ore-winter bump, almost always? 

1. US shale/oil needs $65
2. Saudi can extract at $7 but need around $80 to spend like they do
3. Any amount is not sufficient for the Czar. 

Last one year volatility has been one of the bizzare thing in oil markets.

2334 2018-11-22 20:01:27 Then why does he go after Canada which supplies 40% of our foreign oil? Could it be that all he cares about is his own pocketbook?
2335 2018-11-22 20:01:23 And had he isolated/punished them and oil shot to the moon, you guys would still be bashing @realDonaldTrump 
IMO it seems the media is just using this to further their agenda of getting Trump impeached.

2352 2018-11-22 20:00:16 What Trudeau and other politicians don't get about why oil&gas workers are angry is that most of their retirement savings is in their company's stock that has been decimated. The 'middle class' doesn't get a tax payer funded retirement.

2356 2018-11-22 19:59:55 This action by government showed true sensitivity as even the President had to grudgingly bow to the argument at the time of the efficacy of the wholesale fuel price increase at the time because of the expectations of a low oil price market

2361 2018-11-22 19:59:10 Yes, the unprofessional style and decorum we expect from the “fake house” cream gets to the top and without being making this about colour, oil rises also.

Meanwhile, all her anti oil sands activists are working for a province that’s in complete Energy crisis mode. She’s an abject failure
2365 2018-11-22 19:58:57 You have to fight to get pipeline approvals, it's absurd for these projects to constantly be held up after so much is invested in meeting regulations and standards.

I'm in socialist Ontario, I don't know anything about oil, but I know it's no use to anyone sitting in the ground.
2366 2018-11-22 19:58:57 Other than the fact that Harper had to deal with a dollar at parity to the USD, cratering oil prices and the worst financial crisis since the depression, your points are all great
2367 2018-11-22 19:58:51 I accidently added food to the cooking oil. My bad
2368 2018-11-22 19:58:50 I would add one more: don’t eat modern seed oils like soy, corn, sunflower, cotton, etc. Eat only traditional unprocessed fats like lard, tallow, butter, coconut and extra virgin olive oil.
2369 2018-11-22 19:58:35 And oil
2370 2018-11-22 19:58:20 I learned we should be really thanking Canada because they give us about 40% of crude oil compared to Saudi Arabia who only exports 9 % to US.  Either way poor excuse to side with them.  Flash Trump money and he’ll let you get away with murder. Art of the deal...Tyrrants rejoice
2371 2018-11-22 19:58:14 Why @WholeFoods  do you ask me to add 6! tablespoons of olive oil to the stuffing mix? That's an unreasonable addition of 780 calories.

2374 2018-11-22 19:57:52 They’ve restricted oil multiples times within the last 18 months. There hasn’t been any major shift in oil sources. And why exactly would these other countries sell the US oil at below market prices? OPEC sets production and price. The rest of the world follows suit.
2375 2018-11-22 19:57:51 Saudi imports 11% of your oil. Canada imports 40%. Do the math. Oh right... you can't. Besides you'd rather have a trade war with Canada then with the murderous Crown Prince of the KSA.
2376 2018-11-22 19:57:44 it looks like the most awkward meeting I have ever seen.
infact it is really funny to look at.
2377 2018-11-22 19:57:43 They may be evening shift, lunch break, night shift, finished their part time job in the morning or working later in the afternoon I as a Canadian am as concerned as they are for the oil industry and what this government is doing to thwart it.

2379 2018-11-22 19:57:38 My daddy really just made me sit between his legs to put oil on my scalp Bc he tired of me patting my head . You not my mama byeee
2380 2018-11-22 19:57:35 A bit of the  oil penetrates the porus shell. Then the ice or cold water bath rappidle cools and causes the membrane to constrict helping it separate.

At least thats what I think happens ahhhahaah

It works though. I usually boil 1-6dz for peeling when I need boiled eggs.
2381 2018-11-22 19:57:25 I’m on the East Cost and I make a salad every Thanksgiving. But also every day of the year. My Thanksgiving salad is just bigger! This year’s will have Boston lettuce, arugula, avocado, Campari tomatoes, pumpkin seeds, olives. Dressing: olive oil and balsamic vinegar
2382 2018-11-22 19:57:22 Palm oil farmers or the front for multinational corporations masquerading as farmers to gain sympathy and support for cutting down rainforests in Indonesia and the destruction of orangutans habitats and killing them.
2383 2018-11-22 19:57:14 Invest it my palm oil business to boost my daily production rate. I have applied since for this loan but till now, no sign whatsoever. So what is our fate on this matter.
2384 2018-11-22 19:57:08 Mr. President, you had absolutely nothing to do with the reduction in oil prices. But we are perfectly happy to blame you for the traffic jams.
2385 2018-11-22 19:57:05 that's great assumption that everyone there is a) unemployed, b) only willing to work in the oil and gas industry and not changing career paths.   I switched career paths, doesn't mean that Canada's direction with this industry isn't stupid.
2386 2018-11-22 19:56:47 俺悪い子だからねりゅ〜〜w
ゆたくん一緒に寝よ
2387 2018-11-22 19:56:38 Of course, this is really about him supporting #MBS_murderer . Trump just made up the story for his RW Authoritarian Followers. Saying he is keeping gas prices down supporting Saudis when we get way more oil from Canada.
2388 2018-11-22 19:56:29 Alberta has subsided & let big oil off the hook for known environmental & climate ramifications for decades. Time to shift the paradigm.
Make oil pay for the harms they know they foster. Invest in transition to a clean energy economy that will also but Albertans back to work.

2392 2018-11-22 19:56:18 TRUDEAU SAYS CANADIAN OIL PRICE GAP 'VERY MUCH A CRISIS'

BBG #OOTT
2393 2018-11-22 19:56:11 Maybe they will not sell oil to the USA anymore?!?
2394 2018-11-22 19:55:53 Stay safe and keep turnin’ to the right...
2395 2018-11-22 19:55:39 Or yase dinomite. Saw at in a Joan Wean fill um were he pits oot oil weel fires wi blawin em up.
2396 2018-11-22 19:55:32 So the price of oil dropped again today and nearly 25% since October. Any idea @Tesco @asda @sainsburys @Morrisons when diesel price will come down?? #Playfair #fuel #uk
2397 2018-11-22 19:55:32 The Saudi's learned fairly recently that $20-30 oil does not work for them as their national income (and hence government revenue) will not support the country.  They will do what is in their best interest and not what Trump says.  Trump has essentially no impact on what they do.
2398 2018-11-22 19:55:29 Fancy publishing that photo.
Think you would have more fun at a funeral.
2399 2018-11-22 19:55:27 CANADIAN PM, SPEAKING ABOUT OIL PRICE DIFFERENTIAL, SAYS "THIS IS VERY MUCH A CRISIS"

All created by treehuggers and climate goons.
2400 2018-11-22 19:55:25 Explaining CBD oil to my dad: “it doesn’t get you high, it’s a muscle relaxant.” 
Pops: “sounds like a wallet relaxant.”
2401 2018-11-22 19:55:25 良い子は起きる時間ですよ！！！！！
2402 2018-11-22 19:55:22 I can’t believe y’all put coconut oil on y’all face 
2403 2018-11-22 19:55:15 4.9M barrels were added to US #oil inventories in the last week itself, which reached 446.91M barrels. US crude production is at a record11.7M bpd.

Only a matter of capacity to transport, keeping up w/ the surging output! Brent crude hit $85.28/brl on Oct 2. $62.52 (-26.7%) now!
2404 2018-11-22 19:55:13 Well, I dont want soup, I can make my own soup...5 cups chopped porcini mushrooms, half a cup of olive oil, 3 LB’s celery....you’re through soup nazi.
2405 2018-11-22 19:55:01 I was waiting for the oil to spill over and start a fire.
2406 2018-11-22 19:54:46 Kill more people for lower oil prices the Christian right is behind you.
2407 2018-11-22 19:54:45 Ask em how many ukog they have left
2408 2018-11-22 19:54:44 Clove oil?, taste like a poison but works sometimes. bonjela?. Maybe even some alcoholica? Whisky or rum, you’ll be seedy as fuck in the morning but it’ll help you forget that your tooth hurts for a while
2409 2018-11-22 19:54:42 this is more accurate. As KSA can partially control offer, the US controls much of the demand. The moment US anounces that will ban internal combustion cars, oil futures will drop more than bitcoin did
2410 2018-11-22 19:54:30 A fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent to what the oil industry alone make in a year, but sure a scientist on a decent grant and people who want to save trees etc.. are the bad guys in some global conspiracy to what? Make sure the air and water is clean for everyone?
2411 2018-11-22 19:54:29 Saudi does not control the price of oil. Also U S produces more oil.
2412 2018-11-22 19:54:25 Is there a list of brands in Argentina that experiment with animals or use Pama oil
2413 2018-11-22 19:54:22 so many ppl over there, in Alberta,  demonstrated against oil industry for days and days so I think when some people  demonstrate against Trudeau for couple of hours it will not make much difference in province productivity, also  some of protesters may have their own  business,
2414 2018-11-22 19:54:22  I want to soak this in a carrier oil and put a candle under it
2415 2018-11-22 19:54:21 That was why for a considerable period of time this new system worked autonomously until oil prices rose significantly but unexpectedly. This singular incident made it necessary to introduce subsidy in order to maintain price stability
2416 2018-11-22 19:54:10 You should cut them off, but they provide oil so you won't.
2417 2018-11-22 19:54:08 i was pretty convinced that cbd was just snake oil bullshit but vaping it seems to help with my anxiety! i mean, it also could be placebo effect, but whatever i’ll take it
2418 2018-11-22 19:53:57 does it up risk for yeast infection/does it hurt in a Not Fun way tho...(also does this work in the same cbd oil helps anxiety way but while you get fucked because  a multitasker)
2419 2018-11-22 19:53:56 thankful for the hot piece of ass who helped me change my oil today!
2420 2018-11-22 19:53:50 Even simpler translation: Will trade American citizens for oil especially for they didn't vote for glorious leader.
2421 2018-11-22 19:53:44 I want to let you all know, after all these sales I am going to be adding a “moonstrual” cramp oil blends that will last for so long 
2422 2018-11-22 19:53:43 See the way I look at is I'm sure that has been talked about but if the gas price go up then everyone will blame trump that or he want to get on to of the oil prices before it gets out of control then they'll talk about the journalist murder hard to say really.
2423 2018-11-22 19:53:40 Surprised @realDonaldTrump did not take credit for low oil prices since he is responsible. High supply is not the cause. World economy is tanking and demand is down. Thank you #OrangeTraitor.
2424 2018-11-22 19:53:39 S8j: @OffgridNigeria suggests that we must be careful not make the mistakes we made in the oil sector. The time to emphasis and embed local content in the RE sector of Africa and Nigeria is now. #GridlessAfrica
2425 2018-11-22 19:53:14 Furthermore, Hugh was 76, not 82, and secondly, we are at the levels pre 2016, after which oil soared because of YOU...!!! Fake news from 45
2426 2018-11-22 19:52:52 sorry but 8% of oil revenue is added to other revenue collected not to monies returned to Scotland
2427 2018-11-22 19:52:26 The WEO report, yet again, projects that global fossil fuel use — and related emissions — will grow out to 2040, as oil, gas and coal continue to dominate the energy picture --  peter foster financial post
2428 2018-11-22 19:52:24 Khalistani morons should read the book History of Sikhs written by the Sikh historian Kushwant Singh. How Muslims slaughtered Sikhs burning and boiling them in oil to death.
Sikh community is wiped out in Pakistan. Thousands of Sikhs have been killed by Muslims in last 10 years.
2429 2018-11-22 19:52:19 TwT has been around and in the energy industry all of his adult life and knows supply and demand drive the price of oil and hence gasoline.  The crude production by the Saudi's and the rest of the world is driven by price.  Over producing drives the price down as the Saudi's know
2430 2018-11-22 19:52:16 He’s trying to fend off the speculation that the Saudis gave him low oil prices in exchange for US silence about murdering #JamalKashoggi

2432 2018-11-22 19:52:01 #EndlessWars, yeeee!  We can't even burn the oil we want to steal/control

Look up the Army's war college strategy teaching for the next generation: droughts, famines, religious wars...

Endless wars for deminishing ressources because the US consumes everybody's milkshake
2433 2018-11-22 19:51:54 Because only 10% or AB oil sand barrels are actually effected by the price differential, but hey, messaging, spin, bullshit.
2434 2018-11-22 19:51:51 Apply lotion or body oil while your body is still damp. This will make your skin softer and smoother.
2435 2018-11-22 19:51:37 If you've got the skills, olive oil works too. 
2436 2018-11-22 19:51:35 Oili prices are lower because the US is now the largest oil producer. There is an oil glut in the world. High supply, low demand. Liar, loser.

2440 2018-11-22 19:51:25 He's selling the "cheap oil" line as a defense of his pass to MbS. Why do people take this con-man at his word? He'll be pumping and dumping the next theme as soon as this one stops making headlines.
2441 2018-11-22 19:51:23 happy thanksgiving fuck palm oil and colonizers
2442 2018-11-22 19:51:18 Will that magically increase the price of oil Andrew?
2443 2018-11-22 19:51:15 If you continued to read the news, it was shown that the IRS actually targeted both conservative and liberal groups.  Of course at that point, the news had moved on to other distractions.
2444 2018-11-22 19:51:05 He was a foreign nation with a green card who used his writing to bolster Hamas and Muslim brotherhood.

On Saudi Arabia:  you’re right.  Saudi isn’t our friend. It’s an awful place where the British happens to find oil(if memory serves).
2445 2018-11-22 19:51:03 my favorite thing about my grandmother is that she is fixated on the color orange to the point where every item in her apartment is orange and she has an oil painting of herself hanging in her living room. she is a national hero
2446 2018-11-22 19:51:00 I prefer 25gm whey with coconut oil (20ml) blended, around 45-60 minutes before workouts on Power-Lifting days... I feel less fatigued than days when I didn’t take such pre-workout shakes...
Recovery time is noticeably better too...

2448 2018-11-22 19:50:53 I know, there isn’t anywhere to put the oil in on this tractor. 
2449 2018-11-22 19:50:38 And of course, the olive oil I use is the supermarket ordinary sort, not "extra-virgin" which has less taste and burns even easier.  I used to add olive oil to butter in order to raise the smoke point when I wanted the butter taste.
2450 2018-11-22 19:50:30 Today’s BOGO’s FREE item is cassia!  Such a amazing oil!
2451 2018-11-22 19:50:29 If your make up is oil based you need an oil cleanser to take it off.
2452 2018-11-22 19:50:25 There’s a special way to treat and clean wood Cutting boards; castor oil and stuff. But I feel u.
2453 2018-11-22 19:50:20 This gives him leverage on the prince to keep the oil flowing and oil prices low.
2454 2018-11-22 19:50:18 Canada is the ONLY oil producing 'Globalist' nation ordered to 'keep it in the ground' by the UN 'Arab' Nations ... and the most heavily regulated cleanest resource among them all ... Justin's not here for Canada or Canadians ... he's here to destroy us ...
2455 2018-11-22 19:49:58 So I guess all the Thanksgiving Weekend travelers are thrilled that the airlines have dropped their fuel surcharges because of ultra-low oil prices.
2456 2018-11-22 19:49:53 And @CBCNews just said again the Canadian oil discount may just fix itself with USA refineries coming back on line sometime in the future & line 3 completion end of NEXT YEAR. Can we wait & wait & wait....?
2457 2018-11-22 19:49:52 @RachelNotley there are solutions to the oil problem and shipping of oil.

2460 2018-11-22 19:49:41 Open up oil in the west, we don't want to be reliant on your imported Arab oil
2461 2018-11-22 19:49:41 Too much oil.
2462 2018-11-22 19:49:35 Need to oil my joints again. I swear, sometimes I feel like the tin man from the wizard of oz =A=
2463 2018-11-22 19:49:32 Io metto il tea tree oil, praticamente inzuppo un cotton fioc e poi lo metto sull'afta! Anche fare gargarismi aiuta, tipo metti qualche goccia di tea tree oil in un bicchiere d'acqua e vai
2464 2018-11-22 19:49:32 仕事ができるやつは今頃すでに寝てるはずなんだぜ
2465 2018-11-22 19:49:24 OPEC at multiple times have constrained the production of oil, increasing the price per barrel. Simple microeconomics.
2466 2018-11-22 19:49:24 @AlbertaatNoon 
American firms that get cheap #oil from Canada and make whopping profits in USA as a result aren't going to be happy about Alberta setting up more  refineries.
2467 2018-11-22 19:49:22 When the price of fuel was raised in 2015, the idea was to introduce a price modulation mechanism that would be underpinned by an over/under recovery metric which was sustainable at the time because of the significant drop in crude oil price
2468 2018-11-22 19:49:21 I SHALL BATHE THIS TURKEY IN BOILING OIL
2469 2018-11-22 19:49:13 Dear Mr. Ali, you think if Saudi announce that oil production will be cut by 2mb, and your Iranian oil minster come out and say: Iran will cover the 2mb, oil prices will stay the same?  And your supply and demand BS will hold water? Lol
2470 2018-11-22 19:49:11 Then the Aswan Dam an insult to the whole star called Sirius can bridge a dam. Isaiah 19, there is plenty of oil when Israel signs with Bashar al-Assad and Mel Gibson does a film on the subject of the U.S. Liberty and Israel's role in why it happened and why they could not trust.

“Oil prices getting lower. Great!” Trump said on Twitter Wednesday. “Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!”

2485 2018-11-22 19:47:56 You're welcome.

The olive oil thing I said because it burns very easily, the other two are entirely optional. Everyone in Hungary swears to a different recipe as the only "real" one.

2488 2018-11-22 19:47:49 It’s substantially cheaper than what we pay, and most of your oil is being pipped in from us. Think on that one.
2489 2018-11-22 19:47:35 Still shocked today that yesterday's Fall Fiscal Update had absolutely nothing to say about the crisis in Canada's energy industry.
 
The discount on Canadian oil is threatening thousands of jobs and Justin Trudeau's response has been total silence. (1/n)
2490 2018-11-22 19:47:30 Understand the US's concern about Saudi Arabia greatly escalating the cost of crude oil, but Tulsi GABBARD is on target with this.  Saudi Arabia is a wealthy nation governed by religious zealots that do not have value Western ideals, and actively condone/support anti-US activity.
2491 2018-11-22 19:47:28 And then they want pm to fix the price of oil, maybe Jason Kenny should be getting on a plane to SA and demand they stop producing oil, even better give Trump a call
2492 2018-11-22 19:47:16 Moreover, low prices for oil in SA mean fewer jobs for American oil workers in the US..... he is so clueless!
2493 2018-11-22 19:47:13 Venezuela’s crude oil exports fell 21% to an average 1.126 million barrels per day (bpd) between January and October
2494 2018-11-22 19:47:10 Sorry Evan , nice try but the price differential and Canada's oil patch problems will not go away , as you've been told by PM and which yout  producers chose to believe and throw! @EvanDyerCBC

Angs remind me ukog from 2016, BB concept unfortunately failed and all sp was Base on sentiment until one more thing stop using offensive words.
2497 2018-11-22 19:46:59 Not many of us buy oil by the barrel, so the price you quote means little.  This so-called “big Tax Cut” saves me $2 in gas every two weeks. I’m glad you put out a message just to remind us of these HUGE savings and how nice Saudi Arabia is...when they aren’t torturing people.
2498 2018-11-22 19:46:55 I mean...probably. my dad frys his in peanut oil. Thing is...its the only thing he ACTUAL frys all year so....its a treat for him.
2499 2018-11-22 19:46:49 trump just said the 'world should be held accountable' for the murdering of a journalist by the guy he's making oil deals with and i have to say that im quite impressed with the overt nihilism
2500 2018-11-22 19:46:40 That's not true. The largest point against EE was that if Trans Mountain, Keystone XL & Line 3 all proceed that would easily allow for additional 1.7M bpd capacity.  More than enough for all production growth if oil prices stayed below US$90 per barrel
2501 2018-11-22 19:46:35 We are backing the wrong group in the region. Does the Monday like the US? Do the people like the US? No. We have doubled down with the Saudi's in the hope if cheap oil.  They are now cutting production because of the waivers Trump gave for Iranian oil.
2502 2018-11-22 19:46:32 Will look into the oil less.
2503 2018-11-22 19:46:31 Question remains if she's fighting so hard, why in heavens name appoint Brian Topp, who's been opposed to the Oil Industry his whole career. Who spearheaded the whole failed social licence idea as a key envoy to the industry? Just like Berman, Her Actions speak louder than words
2504 2018-11-22 19:46:31 We don’t get that much oil from the Saudis in reality. Are first source is Canada second comes domestically and then I think it’s the Saudis
2505 2018-11-22 19:46:22 Y’all I full on believe rosehip oil will solve all of my problems now u can’t change my mind
2506 2018-11-22 19:46:11 And price of oil has dropped 40%. The price at the pump is going down. You don’t live in the real world, just criticize things. Never bitch without coming up with a solution.
2507 2018-11-22 19:46:08 soyrizo even emits that bizarre orange-colored oil--my guess no one will notice it's not actual pork. :)
2508 2018-11-22 19:46:06 With $84.5 billion in bonds outstanding, Pemex is the world’s most indebted oil major. Viene un vencimiento en 2027 y el camino escogido por @lopezobrador_ ahora es un arma de dos filos porque podrá mejorar activos pero sin socios técnico/comerciales. OUCH!
2509 2018-11-22 19:46:06 I'd have to change tune depending on customer,  one owns vineyard in Surrey Hills , an oil & gas trader that commutes to hamburg, a director of major houdebuilder, a ret CEO, a shipping underwriter, would be too confusing to have different view for each, so just keep shtum
2510 2018-11-22 19:46:05 How stupid is Alberta,  pipeline now, really. This is what happens when Alberta relied on America for years and blew all the money when oil was over 100 a barrel, it's been in decline since 2014
2511 2018-11-22 19:46:04 I recently asked the same thing from a friend who planned to deep fry the turkey. I just can't imagine so much oil in one place. Yuck.
2512 2018-11-22 19:46:03 Papaya soap, ori and anointing oil for the body, nivea roll on, methylated hair cream, wear clothe and dash out
2513 2018-11-22 19:46:02 Whoever told me to put baby oil n sit in the bath for 30 mins to get fake tan off clearly wanted me to die. Very close to breaking a leg heheh
2514 2018-11-22 19:46:00 I sprayed cooking oil in the oven on some veggies and i really hope my oven doesn’t burst
2515 2018-11-22 19:45:58 All gas from piped from Canada is for export & natural gas which is used for heating - prices are high. This is due to the export for the profits of a few. We were told this destructive fracking was for public need & necessity by Fed agency - oil industry funded #FERC.
2516 2018-11-22 19:45:54 It’s amazing how many people are willing to sell their souls for oil. Get God out of your profile, because you’re a complete hypocrite
2517 2018-11-22 19:45:49 With a population of 80M+ and control of the Strait of Hormuz through which all the oil must flow, you can bet even these sociopaths will think twice before taking on Iran.
2518 2018-11-22 19:45:46 Why is the deficit at $833billion ready to hit $1trillion after your tax cut for corporations, the wealthy AND your family?You need to sanction MBS! Oil prices are NOT down cuz of Saudi Arabia alone. We won't lose arms sales to Saudi if you tell the world the truth!
2519 2018-11-22 19:45:36 Eat some snacks preferably something with oil/fat in it. You do not want to fade early
2520 2018-11-22 19:45:29 Rub oil all over the skin.
Lift up the legs and tie them together.
I love Thanksgiving.
2521 2018-11-22 19:45:26 Those air fryers are awesome. My brother in law used one last year and the turkey was so moist. A lot safer than the oil dryers too. Happy thanksgiving, dudes.
2522 2018-11-22 19:45:17 There isn‘t any climate crisis!
Myth of an inconvenient truth. 

Just ploys to raise taxes.    We need to build pipelines and get $65 per barrell of oil instead of importing oil at that price and selling for only $14 per barrell.    Lets enrich Canadians not foreign saudi oil.
2523 2018-11-22 19:45:17 Too bad that we can't even burn all the oil already extracted, as it would release so much CO2 and push us over the Global Warming tipping point, and then we ALL die.

We have 10 years left, and then your greed for oil will have killed us all.

So Fuck #MBS and the Saudis
2524 2018-11-22 19:45:14 He said smoke. Stay away from the kitchen. Smoking is better.
2525 2018-11-22 19:45:05 He added: “If we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof.”
2526 2018-11-22 19:45:00 The United States receives 40% of its oil from Canada. Yet trump is rude to Canada. I think Saudi Arabia has something else going on with him. Canada would never chop up a Journalist.
2527 2018-11-22 19:44:55 I have rape oil, but since you end up with a temp mid-way between boiling and sauté because you're adding water, olive oil doesn't get to the smoke point.  But I'll try it with beef next time.  And the caraway, yes!
2528 2018-11-22 19:44:53 Reporter asks Trudeau if he'll help fund increased oil rail. Says "Um ahh um... I'm glad to be in AB and... listen to concerns... and... respond to them". Then doesn't answer the question about railways.

2531 2018-11-22 19:44:40 Was your benevolent gift of lower gas prices ignored and so you’d like credit for both the lower gas prices AND the unholy nationwide traffic jams. Job well done!!!! I am in awe of your powers. But.... isn’t cheap oil actually a bribe to ignore MbS’ murder of Khashoggi ?????????
2532 2018-11-22 19:44:21 So why haven't you made #EnergyEast a priority - in order to provide jobs and revenue; while limiting emissions from those tankers carrying imported oil from around the world to Canada?  Why??
2533 2018-11-22 19:44:18 my brother is still not treating anyone in my family with respect i really dont want to be home anymore smh
2534 2018-11-22 19:43:59 Calgary doesn't like @JustinTrudeau, @Bill_Morneau or his anti oil stance.
"Off with their heads!" as they said in the days of old.
2535 2018-11-22 19:43:58 Of course! Lowering oil prices is the Saudi payoff for Trumps support & not holding them accountable for murder.
2536 2018-11-22 19:43:53 Me: So Dad, what are you gonna season the turkey with?
Dad: Olive oil
Me: ..... Anything else? You want to look up some seasoning?
Dad: No
Me: Can you at least put some salt and pepper on it?
Dad: No

My dad is reaching some next level white people cooking this Thanksgiving 
2537 2018-11-22 19:43:49 For Thanksgiving the French have gone on strike and are trying to block the motorways, the oil refineries and Amazon! They’ve seen what a great job they did in Brazil and want to repeat it. No potatoes in the supermarket. Bravo les #GiletsJaunes A nous la destruction de la 
2538 2018-11-22 19:43:45 Yup...you've made it awfully dangerous, by giving a murderer prince your support in exchange for dodgy deals, just ask Kashoggi's family...what would the founding fathers say...values and integrity in exchange for cheap oil?
2539 2018-11-22 19:43:42 And being there is no action.  He has no concrete plan other than to destroy Alberta and it’s oil sands.  Let’s be real about it Rosie. #cdnpoli @MichelleRempel @liberal_party #SaveCanada
2540 2018-11-22 19:43:37 You do nothing but bring us closer to the end of civilization in general. By the way oil and gas has been lower under every other president . You are an awful person . Please recuse yourself from society
2541 2018-11-22 19:43:34 I made banana bread with peanut butter instead of oil [bc I forgot to buy oil] and now I wanna marry this banana bread omg it's so good.
2542 2018-11-22 19:43:33 Happy Thanksgiving!

2545 2018-11-22 19:43:14 We are the largest producer of oil in the world. We import 9% of our total oil from Saudi Arabia.  Why are you thanking them?

2549 2018-11-22 19:42:55 Oil was the largest employer and that matters Jason.
2550 2018-11-22 19:42:51 I cooked an onion in olive oil in a pan and then when they were translucent I added the chickpeas and cooked them for 2-3 minutes then added the sauce and it took like 10 minutes tops, it's so yummy
2551 2018-11-22 19:42:50 We went to war because we were bombed in WW2. The American people wanted no part of WW2. We went into Iraq because of their oil. Not because we didn't like what Saddam was doing. Hell we worked with him when he was at his worst!

2554 2018-11-22 19:42:38 It’s time that the people of Alberta stand up to Trudeau & his Liberals.Trudeau has purposely shut down pipelines to stop the oil from coming out of the ground.Anyone who follows his politics knows this. He said it and he did it.Hypocrite!Salt in their wounds is what he is doing
2555 2018-11-22 19:42:31 I can’t survive without olive oil 
2556 2018-11-22 19:42:29 Giraffes are now endangered. Whales have pounds and pounds of plastic in their stomachs. Oil spills are everywhere. IM. DONE. WITH. DIS. PLANET. AND. NO. ONE. DOIN. SHIT.
2557 2018-11-22 19:42:26 Try a splash of olive oil or whatever kind you like in the water while they boil. Then ice water them after for a few minutes.

Thanksgiving day 2018
2559 2018-11-22 19:42:11 roasted 1 sweet potato, scooped out flesh. Put flesh in blender with 3 roasted cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 50g pine nuts, 8 basil leaves, generous salt + pepper. Mixed about 10 cherry tomatoes (roasted until they were wrinkled) thru it and tossed with ribbon pasta
2560 2018-11-22 19:42:09 @realDonaldTrump You are a funny man. I’m still looking for all the great things you have done . We get most of the oil or gas from Canada. STOP LYING SO MUCH. Facts are facts
2561 2018-11-22 19:42:04 Imagine if rich Arab countries decided to feed clothe and shelter asylum seekers instead of perpetual war games for oil foreign policies.
2562 2018-11-22 19:41:55 Not exactly true. 40% of our imported oil comes from Canada, not total oil. So 40% of the other 60%.
2563 2018-11-22 19:41:47 Bio oil can help get rid of old pimple scars, idk if you’ve tried that yet x
2564 2018-11-22 19:41:29 Errr, oil prices were low when Trump became president. He caused them to spike with Iranian sanctions. And the Saudi $450 b is a pipe dream. Trump is either absolute idiot or the answer is elsewhere.
2565 2018-11-22 19:41:28 Im over here cooking and my mom is behind me talking about how I need to use olive oil and stuff, then as soon as her back was turned my grandma threw a fat thing of butter and bacon grease in and just looked at me lmao that’s why grandma’s foods better
2566 2018-11-22 19:41:26 Finally you keep pointing out that this "cabal" is foreign - i.e. "not one of us" That is exactly the issue that people have with migrants - they are not "us". You are attributing malice to "foreign" agents "controlling" our oil. Oh - Come on
2567 2018-11-22 19:41:25 Your days or numbered, the planet will end palm oil damage.
2568 2018-11-22 19:41:22 My @officialnma t-shirt has been delivered and I swear it has the whiff of patchouli oil about it...
2569 2018-11-22 19:41:18 It doesn’t matter where we get our oil from. The Saudi’s, and therefore OPEC, have the ability to restrict supply of oil to drive prices ten fold. Stick to football.
2570 2018-11-22 19:41:16 Trump: On one hand, a STARVING YEMAN, but, hey, oil prices!
2571 2018-11-22 19:41:15 Canada and OPEC going to cut production at the same time I wonder where oil prices are going? $65 cl 75 Brent by eoy
2572 2018-11-22 19:41:10 Oil dey ur head
2573 2018-11-22 19:41:06 Fun fact, CBC. In the 1.02 minutes this video runs, Alberta lost about $56,700 because of western Canadian oil discount. Because of lack of pipelines. Because of Trudeau. And you don’t have the guts to report that. Just saying.
2574 2018-11-22 19:41:06 Most of our oil comes from the great country of Canada, but not one word of thanks to that wonderful ally. By the way, Canada doesn't murder and dismember journalists, must be why you don't like them.
2575 2018-11-22 19:41:04 I wonder how low the oil prices could go if Two journalists were killed !!!
2576 2018-11-22 19:41:01 Sativa oil
2577 2018-11-22 19:40:50 a common sight, I have seen five deer and one cat in the past 10 years now. Seriously, all from gas and oil and climate change. I also watch my favourite animals die regularly from pesticides, snakes. We lost 90% of our bats and snakes because of it. This is really fucken bad.
2578 2018-11-22 19:40:50 A slug cares more about Khashoggi’s death than this imbecile, and has more brains & personality to boot. The last thing the Saudi’s want is low oil prices, and they have nothing to do with it. The “world” is slowing down, and when they sneeze, we catch a cold. #fuckingmoron
2579 2018-11-22 19:40:48 Waited for that dirty $usdcad to finish its hatchet work. Looking to go long for tomorrow half day session. Maybe might see $oil puke some more. Waiting for the #loonie to come back down to earth.
2580 2018-11-22 19:40:43 Is that how to change oil in your car
2581 2018-11-22 19:40:42 About to drop my bird in the oil but just a quick refresher @BriansBelly Still the best guide on the inter webs.
2582 2018-11-22 19:40:37 Seems like he is not here to discuss oil, but to show how the federal gov't is investing in Calgary....by constructing an expensive building in a city filled with empty buildings and falling real estate values  (classic government investing logic)
2583 2018-11-22 19:40:32 Bloody hell, this is how it should have been on each zone,so don’t go praising the clowns that have tried to stifle questions on what has happened at HH, I want success as I am invested,what I don’t want is a blinkered view point
2584 2018-11-22 19:40:31 We must exploit our resources to the greatest extent possible, to provide jobs; and funding for Government programs such as Health Care! With Energy East Pipeline, we use Cdn oil instead of imported oil. Maximize our exports; incentivize Cdn green energy development. #CommonSense
2585 2018-11-22 19:40:28 Through the years when Alta was basking in high oil prices and wealth, they thumbed their noses at the rest of the Can, wondering why they should share with less fortunate areas. "Take care of yourself". and "The government should not solve problems". Hypocritical now much?"

2587 2018-11-22 19:40:26 Hope these people don't have oil or opium poppies on their island because if they do, they will have to be democratized.
2588 2018-11-22 19:40:20 We Arabs are very lucky, we have oil! 
2589 2018-11-22 19:40:18 It's not just the oil industry.
2590 2018-11-22 19:40:13 Shorting nat. gas and looking to start building a long in crude oil. OPEC and FSU allies increasing output cuts should provide some upside momentum.
2591 2018-11-22 19:40:09 知ってる？スーパーってタダで牛脂くれるんだよ。
2592 2018-11-22 19:39:56 There’s an emerging trend from the Conservatives in QP today. So far they’ve asked why the economic statement gives money to journalism and promised nothing yesterday for: Alberta oil workers; Veterans; businesses struggling with steel and aluminum tariffs; and Dairy producers.
2593 2018-11-22 19:39:50 So, we get 11% of our crude oil from Saudi Arabia. And the GOP advertises that we are energy independent now. Why the disconnect?  And why should we even care about Saudi oil?
2594 2018-11-22 19:39:48 There are really good reasons to wean ourselves off oil.
2595 2018-11-22 19:39:47 Increasing pipeline capacity without a corresponding demand is not going to drive up the price for our oil.
2596 2018-11-22 19:39:46 thanksgiving in the criticos house: my mom refuses to let anyone help her lift a 23 pound turkey....she drops it on the floor. and oil splatters all in the kitchen and family room :)
2597 2018-11-22 19:39:33 My pry sch teacher insisted my long hair & fair skin is of mammy water & not typical of Yorubas. She threatened to cut my hair & use adi agbon (local oil) or make me stay out in the sun to darken my skin. Thankfully, my parents dared her to try it so she will indeed see witches!
2598 2018-11-22 19:39:28 I liked that strategy; they want to cut landlocked AB off from the Cdn coast. It’s the only leverage that AB has. You don’t think the province of BC making a full stop on BC oil to world markets is a negative thing to AB? I’m sorry, I respectfully I disagree with your sentiment.
2599 2018-11-22 19:39:23 There is no excuse for allowing the death of Jamal Khashoggi to be paid by an oil deal with Saudi Arabia as hush money.   You are a puppet in a kings crown.
2600 2018-11-22 19:39:22 No kidding , he won’t do anything else when he’s in there neither , his donors don’t want our oil going to tidewater . They like the price at $15
2601 2018-11-22 19:39:18 Three things I'd add to this:

1. Shin beef
2. Don't use olive oil, use either a sturdier oil (sunflower or rape) or lard/dripping.
3. An optional pinch of caraway can do wonders. Before you pour the water in, roll the seeds between your palms to break them up, then chuck it in.
2602 2018-11-22 19:39:15 あっサボってばかりですみません( ；∀；)
2603 2018-11-22 19:39:14 Not a fan of cooking the tomatoes in anything other than olive oil, you also need maybe some thyme sprigs in the butter so that it makes a nice herby mushroom butter.
2604 2018-11-22 19:39:11 The only timeasturbation is a sin is when you do it with anointing oil
2605 2018-11-22 19:39:07 And Trump has driven gas prices down. 

What !

The fracking industry is driving oil prices lower. Trump had nothing to do with it.
2606 2018-11-22 19:38:59 Lol see as he said kun as if I even know how or who collected the money or my account was the one going around or I didn't contribute too.
2607 2018-11-22 19:38:58 Butterball whole turkeys, frozen baked turkey, smoked turkey, smoked turkey breast, bone-in breast and boneless roast products do not contain any major 8 allergens wheat,eggs,soy,milk,fish,shellfish,peanut oil,peanuts and tree nuts. Gravy ingrs. are listed on front of turkey pkg.
2608 2018-11-22 19:38:56 ...tkx. This might be true, but considering all the other factors of seabird mortality that are not managed,hardly acknowledged (bycatch, oil, plastics) I wonder what difference such work makes? The oceans+seabirds, the climate, are in a crisis state. Why not asking to fix it ?
2609 2018-11-22 19:38:46 Vista Oil % Gas sumó dos concesiones no convencionales en petróleo
2610 2018-11-22 19:38:36 The biggest challenge for Canada is to develop the next industrial / technical industry to reduce the large share of GDP derived from the shipping of oil
2611 2018-11-22 19:38:32 only 11% of our oil comes from SA, 40% from Canada
2612 2018-11-22 19:38:29 @Channel4News   C4 says  UK backed Gaddafi because he had oil, destroyed him because he wouldn't do what it said, then destroyed Libya because it couldn't control it........& asks Why was Manchester Bomber Angry...... C4  We've no idea & We're NOT GOING TO ASK
2613 2018-11-22 19:38:27 Oil prices dipped on Thursday after U.S. inventories swelled to  their highest level since December adding to concerns about a global  crude glut but OPEC talk of an output cut limited losses.
2614 2018-11-22 19:38:19 40% of our oil comes from Canada.  11% comes from Saudi Arabia.  Wrong!  As usual.
2615 2018-11-22 19:38:14 Dont be stupid... if Saudi sell their oil for 90$ why would Canada sell it for 40$. Its not like the Canadian dont know how much is the global oil price. Get your head out of your ass. And fuck donald trump anyways.
2616 2018-11-22 19:38:13 My son is a chemist/biologist for an oil refinery and you are NOT the reason for a drop in gas prices.
2617 2018-11-22 19:38:09 Let's blame he world for low oil prices
2618 2018-11-22 19:38:04 heads buried in the sand. A journalist was brutally murdered, a coverup ensued, no real investigation, etc. But nothing to see here?  Pathetic what some in this country believe. 
SA is and always has been a violator of human rights but oil is more important?
2619 2018-11-22 19:37:58 Except that you have yet to show that the donors who support Pelosi have the kinds of interests that oil companies do. All you gave was a list of names, and we're supposed to automatically assume that they've got nefarious motivations.
2620 2018-11-22 19:37:57 @jkenney everyone is so quick to diss big oil , but they sure like to use the infrastructure big oil royalties have built don’t they?. The schools, the roads, the hospitals, the care centres, the recreation facilities and fields the social programs. Hypocrites they are!!!!!!!!
2621 2018-11-22 19:37:51 + juice, really young olive oil (for a kick), fresh garlic, de-stemmed to cut bitterness, cilantro, a dash of lavender vinegar. Fruit for desert. And a bottle of good local Pinot.
2622 2018-11-22 19:37:46 Nope. Depends on which refinery and what process is used to refine it. Hence the NCI rating which literally translates to newer complex refineries being able to squeeze all hydrocarbon values out of crude oil feedstocks without lost value.
2623 2018-11-22 19:37:44 It's the Sinclair Oil company. 
2624 2018-11-22 19:37:39 lol yiayia brought me some shirts and earrings from when she went to greece and also holy water and anointed oil to "put on if you feel sick"
2625 2018-11-22 19:37:26 I spent 20 minutes rubbing oil all over the turkey; it’s the most erotic thing I’ve done this year. I’d worry about but I’m busy planning turkey menus for the next 4mos.
2626 2018-11-22 19:37:22 yes this is the challenge since trump &france & Israel gave the guarantee to MBS to killed&they are Protect him but  please reduce the oil price & next killer don’t you use the wood working saw,make it as car accident,sinking, head injury or strangulation& good look prince 
2627 2018-11-22 19:37:19 What a terrible conclusion from the US President that oil and money are more important than the life of an American based journalist. Shocking.
2628 2018-11-22 19:37:16 They never do. 
2629 2018-11-22 19:37:09 Unpopular opinion: I dont like curling creams, jellies or gels. I don't like coconut oil in my hair. And I hate diffusers. 

A simple leave in conditioner and just a bit of avocado oil does the trick.
2630 2018-11-22 19:37:04 Very similar. Except I’m Indiana Jones and as I’m running down the tunnel I have to doge boulders, burning oil, spears, etc which are being thrown at me from all sides.
2631 2018-11-22 19:36:52 what he did  in model town case, Justice delayed justice denied, olive oil and honey ,shahrukh jatoi,   so many more
2632 2018-11-22 19:36:52 Low oil prices—translated in trumptalk. Is thanks for all the money you contribute to my family business.
2633 2018-11-22 19:36:49 Cbd oil doesn’t get you high why would you not try it
2634 2018-11-22 19:36:28 But it’s not false that our dollar depends on Saudi Arabia...so it’s not about oil, it’s about the petrodollar
2635 2018-11-22 19:36:20 Tell me now that Big Islamic oil money isn't targeting our social media and systems .......
2636 2018-11-22 19:36:06 Canada supply the US with almost 400% more oil than Sauda Arabia, where is their thanks? I assume it is because the Saudi’s also buy your NY apartments
2637 2018-11-22 19:36:05 He's like a living bottle of olive oil.
2638 2018-11-22 19:36:05 40% of our oil comes from Canada.  11% comes from Saudi Arabia.  Why don't you do a little homework.  Oh, that's right...you don't know how to read.
2639 2018-11-22 19:35:46 Probably more with the money they put in his businesses than oil.
2640 2018-11-22 19:35:44 a good video ....the symbiotic relationships in balance within its environment with Vancouver to learn how to respect nature , Important to live within your carrying capacities and depopulate cities like Vancouver . Oil is good as energy
2641 2018-11-22 19:35:38 Through the years that Alta was basking in high oil prices and wealth, they thumbed their noses at the rest of the Can, wondering why they should share with less fortunate areas. "Take care of yourself". and "The government should not solve their problems". Hypocritical now
2642 2018-11-22 19:35:33 Key word; "Glut" .

You don't ship more oil when the market isn't interested. The oil leaders are idiots.
2643 2018-11-22 19:35:30 Here is the best advice I can give today. When you are about to deep fry the shit out of something in your new fryer. Remember to put the oil in before turning it on. Feeling like a total dickhead.
2644 2018-11-22 19:35:26 The technology is already proven viable, what's needed is political courage. Coal phasing out and renewables up faster than predicted. BEVs & PHEVs (which use legacy fueling for long travel) can displace all urban miles with EV  & over 75% of all oil for transport within decades.
2645 2018-11-22 19:35:26 Loving the sound of midnight oil @djjohnaskew
2646 2018-11-22 19:35:24 Lol!  Use oil filter pliers if you have them in your garage by chance. But thanks for making me laugh 
2647 2018-11-22 19:35:23 Costa Rica is safe from the U.S.

Unless they discover oil under that sand - Then all bets off
2648 2018-11-22 19:35:21 I saw $1.99/gallon in the midwest a week ago. Oil prices are down. I didn't see high prices between GA & OK last week. This must be a regional distortion.
2649 2018-11-22 19:35:18 "I made the oil prices lower after making them higher all year ... you're welcome"
2650 2018-11-22 19:35:14 A halliburton executive and a career oil man invaded Iraq to transfer control of much of their massive oil fields to China and the international oil corporations- including Halliburton last thing GOP wanted was $20 oil flooding the market
2651 2018-11-22 19:35:10 This govt is not keen on oil being transported by any means.
2652 2018-11-22 19:35:05 When have I ever said that we should stop using fossil fuels or not use oil and gas as feedstock for the chemical industry?
The answer is never.
The subject was fossil fuels - which we still just burn to make heat, just as we have done for centuries.
2653 2018-11-22 19:35:01 Oil pulling is believed to help in the excretion of toxic heavy metals by saliva. Oil pulling activates salivary enzymes which absorb toxins such as chemical toxins, bacterial toxins and environmental toxins from the blood and removed from the body through the tongue.
2654 2018-11-22 19:35:00 Or that 40% of US Oil imports are from Canada?
2655 2018-11-22 19:34:58 Dude!  Thanks for pointing this out.  Trump’s disciples will 100% believe what he says and not question it.  I   have an intermediate level of understanding of the oil market and was really confused by what @realDonaldTrump was saying and then I started researching it.
2656 2018-11-22 19:34:52 We have choir robes and pouring oil on people so... close?
2657 2018-11-22 19:34:49 While they're at it,  they could murder some whales to get blubber for their oil lamps.

2659 2018-11-22 19:34:40 Good salt, good olive oil, good potato. What else is there? A little cracked pepper when it’s all said & done?
2660 2018-11-22 19:34:22 + A good bottle of red wine. Maybe add some white balsamic vinegar. For potatoes: olive oil mash, with sautéd chanterelles and gentle touch of leeks. MrsG will be doing her signature fresh cranberry sauce (which is fresh, not preserved and not cooked) - absolutely the best. +

2664 2018-11-22 19:34:14 Obama actually did a lot of things to lower oil prices as a way to corral Putin.
Trump needs high oil prices.for the same reason.
Oil prices are dropping because the economists working for investment houses know a recession is coming in January.

2668 2018-11-22 19:34:05 Jeff and I wishing you all a Happy Thanksgiving from the oil fields in New Town ND. Going on 30 years and never a dull moment with this big man 
2669 2018-11-22 19:34:03 It's also ridiculous to openly tell the Saudis they can murder anyone they want and we won't care because of oil.
2670 2018-11-22 19:34:00 Not defending the orange one at all but the Saudis do have substantial influence on global price of oil via OPEC's ability to increase or decrease supply.
2671 2018-11-22 19:33:57 Pet sitter gave him the wrong fish oil!!!
2672 2018-11-22 19:33:56 I’m so sick of basic vegans complaining about @IcelandFoods “No Palm Oil” campaign for not being good enough! They made such a brave move making any kind of animal rights ad in the first place!
2673 2018-11-22 19:33:47 Ghee, but not olive oil? Strange, I would have bet he was an olive oil man.
2674 2018-11-22 19:33:43 Note to Canada -supplier of more of our imported oil than Saudi Arabia- feel free to start killing folks!
2675 2018-11-22 19:33:42 Man alive wouldn't it be great if we could have an official investigation of George Soros illegal funding of the Trudeau's Liberals during elections and his attempts to kill the Canadian Oil Industry?

2676 2018-11-22 19:33:42 If that happens I have a figure in mind, but it's nowhere near the cost of a Barrell of Oil. Possibly a Quart of used oil.
2677 2018-11-22 19:33:41 I've put on lavender oil couple of times already but it didn't help
2678 2018-11-22 19:33:41 Putin sells his oil all over Europe, Germany, France, Italy & many others. Last month a Russian Oil Tanker arrived at Burnaby BC. Yes Russia’s doing well because they build pipelines and export their God Damn Oil
Canadians are a Stupid people who deserve what’s happening to them

2681 2018-11-22 19:33:32 Even now we don't even sell to anyone,it's doubtful we will be able in the near future,even if we wanted to.there is definitely cheaper prices elsewhere,we can't even manufacture or refine our own oil,sugar e.t.c to even be competitive in the global market!
2682 2018-11-22 19:33:32 Got an oil stain on my timbs last night, guess it’s time to get a new pair
2683 2018-11-22 19:33:22 The US government doesn’t own our oil production.
2684 2018-11-22 19:33:19 The facts:
*20-40,000 jobs
*No actual orders for for more than 100 billion
*Saudi needs us more than we need them for oil
*Saudis always overstate purchases to get a better deal
*CIA says MBS is lying
Come on “art of the deal” Donny. You’re acting like MBS’s bitch. He laughing @u
2685 2018-11-22 19:33:12 Unless free world makes it a point to remove blasphemy, Jehad etc from govt laws and religious books in totalitarian countries, nothing is going to change. We can stop trade with these countries unless secular laws are brought. Not for us Oil is more important.
2686 2018-11-22 19:33:12 If you were an American you would know the USA buys less than 10% of oil from Saudi Arabia and they have no affect on oil prices. How stupid are you? FYI the USA produces their own oil & buys 40% from Canada. Your days as @POTUS are numbered.
2687 2018-11-22 19:33:09 Put cooking oil in a glass bowl you’ll have him caught in the morning. Ur welcome!
2688 2018-11-22 19:33:06 Ohh stgh skin mmg xboleh sgt kan mineral oil. Hahha tu la dah lama sgt dah suffer from acne beb. From 2013. Makin lama makin byk jerawat. Hujung tahun ni baru mcm ok. Hopefully. 5 years journey of hell getting to know my skin,,
2689 2018-11-22 19:32:42 Alright!  Started early.. .had to add a little more peanut oil for more coverage.  I injected a dry rub 2 days seasoned in fridge.
2690 2018-11-22 19:32:41 Hooray for oil!
2691 2018-11-22 19:32:32 Lol USA is the top producer of oil. The price hike is because the Saudis don't manipulate the prices so do the oil magnates of USA are you for real?
2692 2018-11-22 19:32:31 Lowered yes.  For about 14 months all better, then the on que oil turmoil conflicts and some sort of global instability followed by massive shock and horror global economy crash.  

So no. Please rephrase that, prepare for famine and virtual reality. Tick tock.
2693 2018-11-22 19:32:25 They are right about $100....and last a long time because there is no oil.
2694 2018-11-22 19:32:18 @CBCNews Live: what did Albertans do with all those oil boom $ years...pickup trucks and drugs?

2696 2018-11-22 19:32:14 CANADIAN PM, SPEAKING ABOUT OIL PRICE DIFFERENTIAL, SAYS "THIS IS VERY MUCH A CRISIS"
2697 2018-11-22 19:32:11 But that don't matter to you long as they pay billions of dollars for weapons and give you the cheap oil
2698 2018-11-22 19:32:02 Clean up the mustache and get a high and tight maybe buy some oil to help you grow more beard
2699 2018-11-22 19:32:00 Anyone that would donate to those two snake oil salesmen should have their head examined.
2700 2018-11-22 19:31:57 You've lied about the money they are spending on arms purchases, and about effect on price of oil. But even if both of those things were true, our American values are not for sale. Stand for something, or fall for everything. #ResignTrump
2701 2018-11-22 19:31:55 Trudeau admits the oil price differential is a crisis. He says he’s here to talk to industry, business leaders, the province & the city to see how they can further assist. #yyc
2702 2018-11-22 19:31:54 Nigeria is steady concentrating on crude oil when the world is moving fast past it.  Very soon renewable energy will replace everything petrol can power and it will be useless.
2703 2018-11-22 19:31:48 @CanadianPM @JustinTrudeau You must implore Quebec and Montreal to expedite a pipeline east from Alberta in order to sell and get Oil to Europe?
Cc @francoislegault @mtlgazette @LeDevoir Time is of essence ...
Quebec is either with Canada or against Canada ...on this pipeline!
2704 2018-11-22 19:31:46 WD40..or salt and oil..
2705 2018-11-22 19:31:40 Sad decision. Economy will be crippled further. Inflation within its targeted band? Rand strengthening & oil prices coming down. Why are we so obsessed with inflation? When we have such low economic growth. @Fin24 @News24 @cnbcafrica #MPC
2706 2018-11-22 19:31:37 Could you please Highlight the illegal occupation by the  USA of Siria, stealing Oil!!
2707 2018-11-22 19:31:31 can't really imagine Britain will do anything about the UAE given the amount of arms and oil it owns. the trump route dictates.  #c4news
2708 2018-11-22 19:31:30 Tomorrow i will be as slippery as baby oil.
Am not the one who called black Friday so excuse me
2709 2018-11-22 19:31:28 By your screwed up logic, Iran would be just as strategic a partner as Saudi as long as they were buying billions in US arms. Lots of oil and profits for your friends.  You have no ethics.
2710 2018-11-22 19:31:27 Notice to all journalists, your life is less important than oil prices. If you don’t see this as a huge loss for American values then you are blinded by your MAGA bullshit. 

This isn’t partisan, this is allowing murder to slide, for profit. And it’s disgusting.
2711 2018-11-22 19:31:27 Just got blessed with some coquito by the Puerto Rican’s in the oil shop. Too wavey.
2712 2018-11-22 19:31:27 It’s true. If you can only use a tablespoon of olive oil and lemon juice to seasons ya food wtf Is u really cookin up???
2713 2018-11-22 19:31:26 Onions, garlic & ginger cooking in sesame oil on the stove. Best smell.
2714 2018-11-22 19:31:15 There is no lack of oil to pump, the only difficulty is the means to pump, transport, and refine. Those things do take time and usually debt financed money.
2715 2018-11-22 19:31:14 Albert Einstein handles the oil numbers Ben
2716 2018-11-22 19:31:13 I went thru my deep-frying turkey phase in the manliest manner possible. I got thick Neox fireman’s gloves, and when the turkey was done I’d reach my gloved hands into the 375F boiling oil and pull it out. #truestory 
2717 2018-11-22 19:31:10 British comedy will never be funny to me
2718 2018-11-22 19:31:10 Trump, why don't you also thank those 15 million dead and starving Yemeni families since it might raise oil prices if you pull US support for Saudi bombing and blockades that are killing them? 

Happy to pay more at the pump than to fill 'er up over the corpses of children.
2719 2018-11-22 19:31:09 Turns out it takes awhile getting oil to temp in single digits.
2720 2018-11-22 19:31:09 Maybe you should listen to your briefings then? Cause USA is the top oil producer. You produce more oil than Saudi lol so.. #incompetent #RealLifeJoker
2721 2018-11-22 19:31:07 **my cousins are coming tomorrow 
Mom: jannelle rub oil on the leaves on our plants 

Me: why? Since when do we do that

Mom: so it will be shiny . We have company 


2722 2018-11-22 19:31:05 This is admitted quid pro quo. Oil for defense of brutal murder.
2723 2018-11-22 19:31:04 No.  It's because they have no industry outside oil and other extractives.

Totalitarianism doesn't foster creativity and innovation.
2724 2018-11-22 19:30:54 PMJT: this is very much a crisis when you have price differential that is so high with oil. That is a challenge to Albertans. That's why I'm here the day after a fiscal outlook. #Hw

2730 2018-11-22 19:30:34 I just want to know if you can disable the “climate change” “feature” before starting a game. I don’t want to play a game with that snake oil ruse.

 Or at least sold enough snake oil to retire.
2732 2018-11-22 19:30:27 Turkey tip #3
Butterball says when basting Turkey make sure use oil to get complete brown skin. Butter can give you spotty look.

2737 2018-11-22 19:30:00 Funny the oil industry in Canada was heavily subsidized by the Canadian government during its infancy, to the point they created a crown corporation for it. No reason to not do the same for new green technologies other than greed.
2738 2018-11-22 19:29:40 Without their oil, they're a third world country.
2739 2018-11-22 19:29:38 In my country the argument is to promote development. Makes sense on the surface but I suspect it's just politicians doing favors for their backers like everything else. Development is good, oil will run out eventually. Do you want to be at the forefront or scrambling to keep up?
2740 2018-11-22 19:29:37 Seeing what Qatar and Saudi Arabia are doing with
their oil money makes me wonder if Nigeria is
selling coconut oil???
2741 2018-11-22 19:29:25 Exactly, The #Saudis are planning terror against us as we speak . 9/11 was them not Iraq. They want us to fold. We should have invaded them and left them in the street. Take the Oil
2742 2018-11-22 19:29:21 Yeah, Sinclair oil can go to hell. Just Google Sinclair and oil spills for their illustrious past. The green dino doesn't help. #MacysParade

2745 2018-11-22 19:29:09 @AlbertaatNoon 
Strange to be talking about the ailing #oil industry at the same time as talking about how it's producing record quantities and poised to more than double production.
2746 2018-11-22 19:29:05 CBD oil. AND Epsom salt bath. Hope you feel better. Happy Thanksgiving!
2747 2018-11-22 19:29:04 Alas, there’s no gas at all in my building 
I’ve lit my oil lamps so it’ll be toasty in no time
2748 2018-11-22 19:29:00 You are deciding for them already. Why not throw some "we are going to civilize them"? and then "take their oil" and then we "are actin in self defense"?
2749 2018-11-22 19:28:57 30$ is the best price so instead of bitcoin I buy crude oil
2750 2018-11-22 19:28:51 This seems to be a thing where people have more oil money than brains.  I think they underinflate the tires in order to do this. Still impressive though.
2751 2018-11-22 19:28:24 U know what? I never gave these bastards much thought, beyond oil prices, but, damn it, now I truly believe they had way more influence& involment in 9/11 , then I previously believed! Wouldn't surprise me, if it was all their idea! We can't do business with terrorists! 
2752 2018-11-22 19:28:20 So sad. And now theres an enormous oil spill off of Newfoundland.  Thousands of migrating seabirds pass through now. So very sad.
2753 2018-11-22 19:28:16 Let’s get oil pipelines moving
2754 2018-11-22 19:28:10 More and more people showing up! Oil industry has had enough.  BUILD THAT PIPE!
2755 2018-11-22 19:28:10 @BernieSanders you're no Dem. You are a lousy snake oil salesmen that has used & abused our party long enough #GoAwayBernie
2756 2018-11-22 19:28:07 And our oil is sold to you for cheap since we have no where else to sell it. And we generally pay good wages to our employees, follow environmental laws and don’t like to kill journalists. Oh - and we were blackballed by the Saudis for calling them out on human rights.
2757 2018-11-22 19:28:03 But they can do what they want without worldwide sanction because they have oil and spend billions on trade with the other countries . Even Trump daren’t condemn them. I wouldn’t go on principal
2758 2018-11-22 19:27:52 Dont bitch about lower oil prices us plebs have to afford getting to work and heating our homes.
2759 2018-11-22 19:27:40 I wouldn't be willing. We barely get any oil from Saudi Arabia so I say: let them keep the oil and bathe in it
2760 2018-11-22 19:27:30 J'ai ajouté une vidéo à une playlist @YouTube - Bache Chawal or 2 tsp oil se banae ye tasty nashta, jiske aage fail hai chowmine or
2761 2018-11-22 19:27:30 How despicable ,how two faced can anyone be? He purposely destroyed Alberta’s economy by buying the KM pipeline  and now controls it .Like he previously said, the oil will stay in the ground. How can he even show his face there? It’s a slap in the face to all Albertans.
2762 2018-11-22 19:27:29 Tobacco companies warn against labeling cigarette packages. Oil companies warn against environmental policies. Gun manufacturers warn against gun control. This is not news, this is #news1130 advertising for developers.
2763 2018-11-22 19:27:23 How much have those who have been looting, sacrificed? They should use all their loot to subsidize, till the oil dries up, and we can go our way! I know for a fact that as soon as we become like dubai before their transformation, these thieves will leave us alone
2764 2018-11-22 19:27:18 Your love of money and oil is disgusting. No wonder your think #ClimateChage is a hoax.
2765 2018-11-22 19:26:46 I need me a oil change
2766 2018-11-22 19:26:44 We get 4x more oil from Canada than we do Saudi Arabia.
2767 2018-11-22 19:26:41 Big oil has built big infrastructure across the entire country for decades and literally paved the roads in this country, where’s the loyalty to that or are you one of those gold diggers that lives off others until it’s not “cool” anymore?.
2768 2018-11-22 19:26:35 We weren’t even around y’all, we was busy getting bombed and blasted for our oil
2769 2018-11-22 19:26:30 IMHO - if you badmouth Oil in Alberta, you're effectively committing blasphemy. You'll never be forgiven and your sin will never be forgotten. @AlbertaatNoon
2770 2018-11-22 19:26:28 What an idiot..we are tired of his lies. 10% of our oil comes from Saudi wells..40% comes from Canada..but then his hotels in Canada aren't doing well..
2771 2018-11-22 19:26:18 Hahahaha!  I was expecting this backlash from peeps who read the post too hastily. Read btwn the lines bro. It was an (albeit weak) attempt at sarcasm. Everyone knows we hav nothing but oil. Anything other notion is either ignorance or propaganda.
2772 2018-11-22 19:26:13 So when Republicans get campaign financing from oil companies you don't think it affects their vote?
2773 2018-11-22 19:26:11 Brined it over night. And the coated it in vegetable oil and a rub. Then used those juices to baste it every hour.
2774 2018-11-22 19:26:07 ive been looking into getting CBD oil.... i just need smth
2775 2018-11-22 19:25:46 いろんなバイト受けまくってパチンコ屋ですら落ちた私がやっと受かったバイト先一ヶ月でクビになりましたが、、！次のバイトどうしよ〜かな〜〜〜
2776 2018-11-22 19:25:42 No olive oil with the zaatar?
2777 2018-11-22 19:25:42 He's confusing Brent oil price with west texas...two different things. Saudi has nothing to do with west Texas.
2778 2018-11-22 19:25:38 You are selling our reputation and our Democracy to the lowest bidder for a barrel of oil and a dollar.  My prayer is that the scales will fall if the eyes of your followers and that the @GOP will abandon your hateful ways.
2779 2018-11-22 19:25:36 The Trump Admnistration is sucking up to the murderers of Jamal Khashoggi -- where 15 of the 19 9/11 hijackers and Osama bin Laden were born -- Trump should be tried as an accessory to Khashoggi's murder -- Trump wants money, oil, dead journalists ...
2780 2018-11-22 19:25:27 Sad but this is Saudi Arabia fault. We from Europe should make more pressure. Oh wait they have oil. I bet the news will blame this on Iran
2781 2018-11-22 19:25:24 I’m all for this boycotting palm oil thing, but when a higher percentage of deforestation is for farming meat and growing crops to feed farm animals people don’t seem to care 
2782 2018-11-22 19:25:22 About buying rail cars to transport oil: Trudeau says he shares concerns & fears about price differential. He mentions the capital cost allowance announced yesterday. Doesn’t say feds will buy more cars or help the province. Trudeau speaks with industry & business later. #yyc

2785 2018-11-22 19:25:09 “Thanks for the cheap oil…oh, any tips on getting rid of inconvenient journalists? Just curious…”
2786 2018-11-22 19:25:07 Can you explain if climate change is so important to #teamtrudeau then why are Canadian tax payers paying for a Texan oil pipeline? Cause under a so called young leader this is gravely disingenuous to the Trudeau voter base that's probably as young as you and me. Why hurt us all?
2787 2018-11-22 19:25:04 #farmout 

AGMI releasing US$2.275 million of cash to #Melbana and, at zero cost to Melbana, drilling the company’s three best cuba targets, testing a best estimate of 270 million barrels of oil. Offering company 12.5% of profit on oil sales in the event of success.

2790 2018-11-22 19:24:43 PMJT: will sit down with industry leaders later today to talk about suggestions about what more we can. (Did not answer question about whether Ottawa would help with more trains to transport oil). #hw
2791 2018-11-22 19:24:43 JFK was elected in 1960 and his murder was planned from day one. It took three years and a final plot in Dallas Texas....Dealey Plaza a location chosen by LBJ and George H W Bush to finish the job. Big oil, the CIA, FBI, and the Military Industrial Complex wanted JFK dead.
2792 2018-11-22 19:24:24 There’s an App (Oil) for that!
2793 2018-11-22 19:24:22 i’m not saying bread is bad! every once in awhile i can kill some bread dipped in oil
2794 2018-11-22 19:24:22 You don't need to buy MCT oil and whatnot to do keto. Are you stupid?
2795 2018-11-22 19:24:20 What ideology? That past oil crashes have resulted in negative migration for Alberta regardless of the government of the day? Which ideology is that?
2796 2018-11-22 19:24:14 Okay I recognize the Barenaked Ladies from the late 90s era of pop music when everything was made by chubby white guys in Hawaiian shirts. And I recognize the Dinosaur float sponsored by Sinclair Oil from late stage capitalism. All very cool. #MacysDayParade
2797 2018-11-22 19:24:11 Example of @Chevron racism? If the U.S. EPA standard applied, @Chevron would owe each of its cancer victims in Ecuador $7m or $70 billion total. That's what oil companies in the U.S. must pay. Chevron has paid nothing. #ChevronSlowGenocide @Lenin @AmazonWatch @rogerwaters
2798 2018-11-22 19:24:08 Consent is binary. You either agree or you don’t. This misses the nuances about opinions of #digital #health #data sharing, explains @matthwilliams at @medDigital’s 10th birthday. So data isn’t the ‘new oil’, but #blockchain might have a role
2799 2018-11-22 19:24:00 That may well be true but have u seen the oil prices???
2800 2018-11-22 19:23:39 re: Oil prices down;
  Thanks to DJT for making America oil rich. This will not make the MSM cause it's a good thing especially
due to Thanksgiving travel.
  Soros' LibLeftDems & idiot supporter won't understand
cause they're plain dumb & have sh*t for brains
2801 2018-11-22 19:23:33 Yeah, we don't care how many American residents you kill, just give us cancer causing, planet destroying cheap oil! Yay, 'Murica!
2802 2018-11-22 19:23:24 Stephen Harper’s legacy of failure continues to haunt Canadiens.  Harper had nine years in office and could not build a single pipe line to the West Coast freeing Alberta oil. That level of incompetence is hard to fathom.
2803 2018-11-22 19:23:22 So where is all the money people crowd funded? Kun cinye ko?
2804 2018-11-22 19:23:20 Whoever crashed and caused an oil spill and two lanes to be closed on the M62 you’re a selfish waste of space
2805 2018-11-22 19:23:20 @jdawsey1:Asked President Trump about Khashoggi killing minutes ago. He said that Crown prince regretted the death even more than he did, that the “world” was 2blame, that the CIA had not concluded that MBS was responsible & that low oil prices were a key reason not 2punish KSA.
2806 2018-11-22 19:23:14 trekell has some mysteriously good prices on some of the more difficult/expensive oil colors and those don't appear to be sales prices so keep that in mind.
2807 2018-11-22 19:23:05 I figured the State Of Texas was the biggest oil supplier!
2808 2018-11-22 19:23:04 I'm thankful for the CBD oil for taking the edge off social interaction. 
2809 2018-11-22 19:22:41 2. Why play? When you get it right the upside is very large. In turn it is very hard to get it right. There are a million ways to get screwed. At its core it is a spread game. Revenue is gold price. Costs are inputs to discover and produce. Capital, oil, labor, materials.
2810 2018-11-22 19:22:39 That is correct. However, private companies trying multiple times to build pipelines so that Canada can sell its oil at a the world price but being prevented from doing so by self-interested political entities is the  opposite of a subsidy. It's forcing industry failure
2811 2018-11-22 19:22:35 Made by Char-Broil. Absolutely amazing. Incredibly moist and no oil to get rid of after it is done. Simply the best. Cooks with regular propane, too.
2812 2018-11-22 19:22:31 Agreed. Actually here in Texas there in more oil and nat gas reducing the leverage of the mid east.
2813 2018-11-22 19:22:29 Why don't we fucking stop being dependant on these assholes in the Middle East with their oil and use renewable energy for a change. That's the way to #MAGA
2814 2018-11-22 19:22:25 Hold up, I think there’s oil in that small room.
2815 2018-11-22 19:22:14 Conservatives saying Alberta is being ravaged by oil prices. There are multiple new mcmansions being built on prime farmland down every single rural road out here. And the majority have enormous motorhomes in the driveway.

Hell yes. Ravage the rich. Feed them to our children.
2816 2018-11-22 19:22:12 But that’s not why we are suffering. Many factors are beyond her control. 

We are suffering because US Texas oil refineries are closed, shale oil production in US, Saudi & OPEC production manipulation.

She nor Feds have control over these contributing factors, nor would UCP.
2817 2018-11-22 19:22:09 That football game put me to sleep. I stopped the drink counts a couple years ago when I switched to 22 ounce oil cans and drinking Jameson’s last afternoon. It’s like I’m playing 148 games vs 162.
2818 2018-11-22 19:22:04 What you’re not doing is anything to move our infrastructure forward so we are not so dependent on gas guzzling vehicles that keep us dependent on big oil and ruin our environment. Nothing in two years but more cars, less quality roads and more lies about infrastructure. Happy.
2819 2018-11-22 19:22:01 How have I never noticed that big oil has infiltrated the #macysthanksgivingdayparade
2820 2018-11-22 19:21:58 “Thank you ma’am here’s your oil sprinkled with some chicken.” 
2821 2018-11-22 19:21:52 Corporate net income is all taxed at the same rates.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. That rate applies to oil companies and every other corporation domiciled in the U.S.
2822 2018-11-22 19:21:51 Thx to u it's a meaner & more nasty . 
We get it u would rather line ur pockets than stand up for American values. 
10% of oil comes from Saudi Arabia & frankly we don't need to be working for vicious murders. So shove ur  some where else.
America is better than this crap.
2823 2018-11-22 19:21:46 We get 11% of our oil from Saudi... 

9% from Venezuala... 

8% from Mexico... 

4% from Columbia... 

40% comes from Canada... and 

28% from everywhere else.
2824 2018-11-22 19:21:46 Yep. And TCP walked away from EE because with TMX, KXL & Line 3 all proceeding that would easily allow for additional 1.7M bpd capacity.  More than enough for all production growth if oil prices stayed below US$90 per barrel. It wasn't economically viable.
2825 2018-11-22 19:21:42 So funny how all these trolls drive around on our roads paved by our oil revenue, tweet on the phones made from our product but diss the fact that the entire country let alone Alberta has benefited immensely for decades from oil and gas . Hypocrite trolls
2826 2018-11-22 19:21:35 How exactly did you bring the oil prices down? Is there a naughty tape out there that would explain it?
2827 2018-11-22 19:21:35 This deserves to become an oil painting
2828 2018-11-22 19:21:33 I’ve decided on Saturday that I would become a wellness advocate for doTerra and live a healthy live style one oil and one day at a time
2829 2018-11-22 19:21:30 えへん(?)
2830 2018-11-22 19:21:29 trying to change my oil by myself... let’s see how this goes 
2831 2018-11-22 19:21:25 Just keep digging your oil hole deeper. Eventually you will slide right in!
2832 2018-11-22 19:21:22 Best turkey I have ever done. Spatchcocked, salt, pepper, coconut oil spray all over. AT 450 for 72 mins.
2833 2018-11-22 19:21:17 Yay Tofurkey is going in the oven next

I love that little ovoid glob of seitan and tofu covered in olive oil and Montreal chicken rub.
2834 2018-11-22 19:20:58 Canada suppliers the US with 4 times the oil that the Saudis do. Does this mean we can murder 4 people of our choosing? Are we allowed to burn down the White House again?
2835 2018-11-22 19:20:40 Lower prices are directly related to the dons great plan of letting eight country’s buy Iranian oil. While everyone else was ramping up production counting on the Iranian sanctions to prevent oil exports. What this does is put a smuzzle on USA shale oil production.

2838 2018-11-22 19:20:22 BUT HE HAS OIL!!!
2839 2018-11-22 19:20:02 Slow global economy is reducing oil futures. Saudi Arabia exhausting reserves ends market maker status by 2030s & needs >$100/bl. The kingdom pursues self interest, maybe some extra production to lower US frack. profitability. But, future is for over $100/bl. Oil is fungible.
2840 2018-11-22 19:19:55 Been epileptic since I was 3 and never needed CBD oil. I feel for the kid. I've never had 100 seizures in a day. Most I've had is 20 in a single day. It's no joke.
2841 2018-11-22 19:19:53 @CadburyUK say they only use sustainable forests. But why does Palm Oil need to be in so many things? |I assume because it's cheap or by adding it, it saves them money? 

Killing off nature seems like hell of an expensive price to pay to me :(
2842 2018-11-22 19:19:52 we often have kale with just a mess of sliced garlic and some sort of oil, and it's perfectly good. Why not soyrizo?
2843 2018-11-22 19:19:42 What’s better about oil than balm?
2844 2018-11-22 19:19:25 The MBS  being the sole reason for low oil prices  is not exactly true.  And, if it was, America does not, never has and  hopefully never will prosecute the  very core values that define the essence of our “humanity” and our “democracy”.
2845 2018-11-22 19:19:21 Ful mdamas: fava + garbanzo beans cooked with garlic and chili flakes, finished with olive oil.
2846 2018-11-22 19:19:20 Today numerous homes will be burned to the foundation because somebody's drunk uncle is going to try to deep fry big ass frozen Turkey in canola oil his garage.
2847 2018-11-22 19:18:57 So the oil and gas Field doesn’t need subsides then by your logic
2848 2018-11-22 19:18:56 Interesting points, the only thing is that Belarus actually bought oil from Venezuela, but not Nicaragua

2853 2018-11-22 19:18:40 It wouldn’t be an issue if it wasn’t for Harper’s legacy of failure.  Harper had nine years in office and could not build a single pipe line to the West Coast freeing Alberta oil. That level of incompetence is hard to fathom.
2854 2018-11-22 19:18:35 Their old slimy dabbed in machine oil slid into their dearest bodily flower
2855 2018-11-22 19:18:24 It's like Oil & Water. Especially when they openly Resist integration. What ever happened to 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do'? It is possible to keep certain aspects of your culture and still submerge oneself into the current dominant culture
2856 2018-11-22 19:18:20 Is there really a better sound than when that plantain hitting that hot oil ?

2859 2018-11-22 19:18:07 We import 4 times as much oil from Canada as Saudi Arabia. Who does #RedDon attack?

It's going to be great !
2864 2018-11-22 19:17:45 Nonsensical argument. The waters are a resource. If we sell oil to a third party, do they demand access to our oil fields?
2865 2018-11-22 19:17:44 Yeah Jones would fuck him up. Easy.
2866 2018-11-22 19:17:43 Bitumen has a small percentage of content that is easier to convert to Asphalt oil than most other oil sources. It actually makes it more valuable to many growing non-OECD nations.

2868 2018-11-22 19:17:30 We thank him for the continued recession in Calgary. That was his plan all along , to phase out oil sands. Looking at his smug face makes me angry. Time to go punch the bag.

2870 2018-11-22 19:17:09 This guy just thanked Saudi Arabia for low oil prices? Wtf!
2871 2018-11-22 19:17:08 Wow, I thought it was in oil 
2872 2018-11-22 19:17:05 Saddam was killing tens of thousands of Iraqis annually for over a  decade. We only acted when he attempted to seize Kuwait and control the  oil market. We did not assassinate him. He was tried and executed by Iraqis.
2873 2018-11-22 19:16:58 tomorrow everyone is encouraged to wear their state shirts or other BLACK football shirt!! come out to lucas oil to cheer on your panthers
2874 2018-11-22 19:16:46 Great. Maybe the Saudies can murder three or four more news reporters and oil would go down to $30 a barrel. Right?
2875 2018-11-22 19:16:45 Pressure cooker all the way, fast and you can get good texture. But then the flavor is tough—I usually toast some cumin seeds and mustard seeds in hot oil, then add a ton of lemon juice and salt.
2876 2018-11-22 19:16:45 Rub it down with steel wool and a light oil.
2877 2018-11-22 19:16:42 That's not exactly accurate. The largest point against the economics was that if Trans Mountain, Keystone XL & Line 3 all proceed that would easily allow for additional 1.7M bpd capacity.  More than enough for all production growth if oil prices stayed below US$90 per barrel
2878 2018-11-22 19:16:41 We don’t even get a majority of our oil imports from Saudi Arabia.
2879 2018-11-22 19:16:24 They know who's to blame for low oil prices
2880 2018-11-22 19:16:20 What are those purchases and where are the receipts? Where exactly is this 459b you blather about? There is no historic commitment.  We do not need their oil. You lie.

2884 2018-11-22 19:15:58 The US supports Saudi Arabia militaristically by selling them military hardware and training in exchange for them selling us oil.
2885 2018-11-22 19:15:48 I would have chosen @AdrianEdmondson 

I do believe he got some good digging skills, or at least good at getting others to dig for him.  (Ref: The Young Ones - "Oil".)
2886 2018-11-22 19:15:41 Three times more oil comes from Canada to US tgan from Saudi Arabia. Canadian oil is about $17 a barrel right now. So Donald, you're again ing.
2887 2018-11-22 19:15:40 Just a warning tho, do not stay in the sun with baby oil on. That stuff will burn your skin and damage it, please be safe 
2888 2018-11-22 19:15:38 domestic oil… !!?
Yes…
Witch cover 50% of world’s oil…
2889 2018-11-22 19:15:31 That's because global demand for oil has dropped while production increased.  You had absolutely nothing to do with this.  What a moron.
2890 2018-11-22 19:15:30 Actually, we are talking about blood for oil.
2891 2018-11-22 19:15:23 Oh cool, are we now gonna ship oil by mail?
2892 2018-11-22 19:15:02 they'll let him into the family wine cellar eventually, turn left at the thatcher oil painting for the reds
2893 2018-11-22 19:15:00 If you like a lot of chili oil on your roti, join our club!
2894 2018-11-22 19:14:56 Market supply and demand determines the price of earl (oil). The higher mileage standards set by Prez Obama many years ago started the downward trend. #Trumpys are usually full of it...not Turkey.
2895 2018-11-22 19:14:55 Yes I made some with a little coconut oil. I wasn’t sure which margarines or spreads are okay. Good to know for future!
2896 2018-11-22 19:14:46 Health-onscious people say ANY food is just a delivery system for Olive oil...
2897 2018-11-22 19:14:31 Who cares if someone get murdered but thank you saudis for that oil. I take we not making you rich
2898 2018-11-22 19:14:28 Low oil prices are not showing up in the pumps
2899 2018-11-22 19:14:28 Bird #1 is out and resting, now to crank the oil back up and lower in the second 
2900 2018-11-22 19:14:23 Trump doesn't care about intelligence. He'd rather believe allowing Saudi Arabia to assassinate Kashoggi is why America oil expense is down per barrel. True Capitalism without morality. That's an unethical talking point as well as behavior for a sitting President
2901 2018-11-22 19:14:22 My mom put peppermint oil on the toilet paper roll and now my asshole is numb, happy thanksgiving everyone
2902 2018-11-22 19:14:19 When a barrel of oil cost $45 gasoline cost $1.25 a gal . Let that sink in if you think America is getting a break .
2903 2018-11-22 19:14:12 Hey, I work in oil pastels, too! Love them! So much fun! 
2904 2018-11-22 19:13:59 This day couldn’t get any worse went to post office to pick up my  @HouseOfCB order and opened it and the whole parcel was covered in oil, the post office then has the cheek to blame this on house of CB or parcel force and trying to claim that it has nothing to do with them 
2905 2018-11-22 19:13:57 I had to change my oil! I had stuff to do 
2906 2018-11-22 19:13:57 As a Cdn I buy less American, whole steel and aluminum tariffs piss us off. Causes value of Cdn$ to go up. Causes Cdn oil (largest supplier to US, 40% vs. 11% from Saudi Arabia) to become more $$, causes gas price to... ooops!
2907 2018-11-22 19:13:51 I’ll assume you’re not aware that Saudi only provides 11% of its oil to the US and that the largest supplier of oil to the US is CANADA. 40%. 
Thank them.
Not the country whose crown prince executed a US citizen.
2908 2018-11-22 19:13:50 So,  we're being blackmailed.  Held hostage by oil.
2909 2018-11-22 19:13:50 You are a PATHOLOGICAL LIAR. The gas prices fell because of free-market conditions. In fact, your new (or is it old) masters,the Saudis, have repeatedly lowered production to drive oil prices up.
2910 2018-11-22 19:13:40 Hell, Saudi Arabia needs to sell gas. They need us more than we need them because they don't have an economy outside of oil
2911 2018-11-22 19:13:36 He is my son, very gentle and faithful to what has been entrusted to him.
Happy birthday son.
May u prevail where the eagles fail
May your head never lack oil 
Happy birthday Mickee Kwame Forson
2912 2018-11-22 19:13:34 #FossilFuels-driven #Airpollution was just rated, again, as the greatest source of loss of potential from the human race. Burning (even cheap) oil into oblivion isn't a good business model for economies, communities, humanity in general. imo.
2913 2018-11-22 19:13:30 If oil pens existed when I was in my 20s I can think of at least 3 Thanksgivings that would have gone a lot smoother.
2914 2018-11-22 19:13:27 What’s the average cook time? Your placement of the bird into the oil was so expertly done, I think that’s where everything can go wrong quickly. Looking forward to seeing more photos. 
2915 2018-11-22 19:13:21 Thank God our Country is stopping deals and not buying Oil from them.... oh wait.... we are not.
2916 2018-11-22 19:13:18 He isn't that good. No control. Is he is only "good" b/c Cashman spun it so as he is a snake oil salesman. Just like a other salesman :)  Happy Thanksgiving!
2917 2018-11-22 19:13:04 This is a game changer - shale oil production in the US is growing like gangbusters. And Keystone XL is going nowhere! Can't we at least get Transmountain going. Surely twinning an existing pipeline is a credible idea?
2918 2018-11-22 19:13:02 Saudi Arabia maintaining current oil production levels will continue to keep oil commodity prices low. Sorry Alberta, high oil prices won’t be coming back for awhile.
2919 2018-11-22 19:13:01 Almond butter, raw cocoa powder mix it with a little bit coconut oil, it might be too bitter so add maple syrup ( pure ) let it in the freezer for a while.. YUMMMMMMYYY! It mind sound like it’s a lot buts it’s simple. But this helped me when I crave chocolate,sweets
2920 2018-11-22 19:12:58 Wow, so it’s ok to kill a US resident, as long as you lower oil prices. The sad part is that lower oil prices has nothing to to with Saudi this time.
2921 2018-11-22 19:12:57 . Abeg who get black oil
2922 2018-11-22 19:12:56 追いオリーブもいいけど、追いフォローもよろしくな。
2923 2018-11-22 19:12:52 The fracking states would love oil to be $150 a barrel.
2924 2018-11-22 19:12:39 Trump on oil prices: 
I was blamed for causing traffic jams because I have the oil prices are too low. All because I’m telling them all to keep their oil prices low. No one ever did that. No president ever did that. And gasoline is now at a very low number.
2925 2018-11-22 19:12:34 Better still - break the oil addiction. Buy an Electric Car.
2926 2018-11-22 19:12:13 A little more olive oil running through the polonaise sauce, finer chopped egg too but other than that, a great effort... how does it taste? Your thoughts Marcus?
2927 2018-11-22 19:12:13 This is not about Trumps business, nor is it about oil prices. It is not about a cover up nor is it about protecting anyone.
This is all about one thing , and one thing alone. 
The common enemy :

Iran.
2928 2018-11-22 19:12:07 You have no idea what you are talking about.  Oil companies are all subject to the same corporate tax rates as any other business in America, including my own.  There are not separate rates which vary by industry.
2929 2018-11-22 19:12:02 But it was oil production over supply and winter gas change over that lowered prices - NOT Ford. Send a nice letter to Shell and Petro Canada - they did more for you then Mrs Ford’s boy.
2930 2018-11-22 19:11:59 We fucked over your entire Oil and Gas sector, so now we’ll put you in Socialist Housing Projects. Love it when a plan comes together EH 
2931 2018-11-22 19:11:58 Has everyone forgotten that we have oil fields and oil reserves that are untouched? Domestic oil production increased under Obama. We are propping up UAE, not the reverse.
2932 2018-11-22 19:11:53 You’re wrong, you’re lying., you’re spreading fake news! More expensive every year during this presidency. Shouldn’t be bragging. BTW we get most of our oil from Canada not SA. And SA NOT buying 450 B dollars worth of whatever. Dear lord you could get it right but don’t want too.
2933 2018-11-22 19:11:50 Libya's crude & condy exports so far in Nov at 946,000 b/d. Most oil so far coming from Es Sider,Marsa al-Hariga&Zawia ports. Zawia connected to El Sharara oilfield= attack took place Tuesday at sub-station.  #Libya #ElSharara #Zawia
2934 2018-11-22 19:11:47 Lodging with a live-in landlord, but she is out most days. The heating is on for 2h/day and it gets super cold around midday. Today asked to put the heating up a bit. Was advised to go to local library, put more layers or pay £1/hr extra for an oil heater #ventyourrent @genrentuk
2935 2018-11-22 19:11:40 Hey Barbie..... Your environment is presently having the largest oil spill in history on the east coast right now.... Whatcha say? Aren't you the minister of environment ?     No comment? If it's not about carbon tax, your not interested????
2936 2018-11-22 19:11:36 Dissapear; donuts, 'healthy/fat loss/pure chemical/protein()snacks', overconsumption of avocados, coconut oil everything, sad salads, acai/charcoal.

2937 2018-11-22 19:11:35 they're not gonna need an oil change for 6000 miles after this one
2938 2018-11-22 19:11:35 I dont disagree, but I still hold the view it's not hypocritical. Semantics perhaps and you are right to raise it as an issue. I can choose to go to Iceland and not buy meat but buy palm oil free stuff @IcelandRichard
2939 2018-11-22 19:11:33 From the point of view of high level decision-makers, they are both situations that have very high profit potential for "defense" and oil industries. Identical situations for them.
2940 2018-11-22 19:11:22 No democrat is "right wing" on economics. Not one voted for lowering taxes on middle class and corporations (corps had the highest taxes on the planet), deregulations of Obamas business killing regs,fairer trade deals, increasing energy production shale oil,fracking,etc.
2941 2018-11-22 19:11:13 I needa oil change, & brakess
2942 2018-11-22 19:11:09 This shape and size is phenomenal! Soon enough you're gonna have to move up to using stacked oil tankers....
2943 2018-11-22 19:11:08 @Oreo sort it out, your products are liften anyways, don’t know why anyone would buy them. Taste like piss. Destroying rainforest for parm oil. Time for a change, we need it quick #WWF #greenpeace
2944 2018-11-22 19:11:08 Oil stocks are looking good again after OPEC and Russia get in line on output
2945 2018-11-22 19:11:06 Olive oil and a turkey baster it is..... Lol
2946 2018-11-22 19:11:01 Top The oil in your Generator.
2947 2018-11-22 19:10:56 BS. As a Mètis Elder that grew up in Fort McMurray, I know exactly what the Oilsands were called. Even my 104 yr old Great Grandfather told me in 1963 how 1 day Alberta would thrive because of our oil in the northern sands. Great Canadian Oilsands was the 1st plant.
2948 2018-11-22 19:10:42 That’s why i ended up doing the trial and error thing. I twist w coconut oil
2949 2018-11-22 19:10:38 i want to share that coconut oil is politer than not-butter because you can get it in gallon buckets and scoop it out
2950 2018-11-22 19:10:30 Well...... America is oil’s bitch......... so, maybe there is a correlation where we as a people are ducked up?
2951 2018-11-22 19:10:24 This @josie_maran argon oil moisturizer 
2952 2018-11-22 19:10:24 When hitler killed Jews, we refused to take Jewish immigrants and didn’t go to war until Pearl Harbor was bombed. When saddam Hussein killed his own people we didn’t care, but when he invaded Kuwait we went to protect our oil interests and then left him in power.
2953 2018-11-22 19:10:23 It doesn’t matter where we get our oil from; Saudi Arabia increasing production will drive the global oil price lower, which in turn lowers how much we pay at the pump.
2954 2018-11-22 19:10:23 The US gets 11% of its oil from Saudi Arabia. The US gets 40% of its oil from Canada. What's wrong with you? Is it because you detest democracies and idolize murdering kings, princes and dictatorships?

SERIOUSLY - WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???
2955 2018-11-22 19:10:19 Damn ask Tonya what tanning oil she uses 
2956 2018-11-22 19:10:18 Stop  claiming things you dont have control or you dont know how they work. Oil is going through normal cycle
2957 2018-11-22 19:10:14 NL Govs have overspend $13 billion in the last 13 budgets, increasing the budget 45% because of the oil revenues was reckless and populist, investing the money in Boondoggle Falls has a negative rate of return. $1 BILLION debt servicing costs V $540M had accord money made 4%ROI
2958 2018-11-22 19:10:13 Bloqueador de eucerin control oil 
2959 2018-11-22 19:10:04 just thinking that Canada could increase tariffs on OIL... you know... since it's a 'national security issue'....
2960 2018-11-22 19:10:03 これはおっぱいじゃなくて油の貯蔵庫だよ。最悪の事態の時はここから、ね。
2961 2018-11-22 19:09:55 fwiw in isa's recipes that swapped from not-butter to coconut oil, it was 1:1, so you're probably fine!
2962 2018-11-22 19:09:55 But Canada's Jihad Justin would rather we buy our oil from Saudis than to keep our own resource economy moving. #totalitarianism #globalism
2963 2018-11-22 19:09:50 Use olive oil to soften and soothe your cuticles. Dip a cotton ball in olive oil and apply to fingers and toes.

Considering that all those Saudi princes are known for being into European women as entertainment, how much will oil prices go down if they can get Melania to ply her profession for a night?

2966 2018-11-22 19:09:41 This thanksgiving were giving thanks to MOSSAD and Sodomy Arabia, the ones who plotted and executed attacks on the twin towers in exchange for oil and weapons contracts. Let that sink in!! Money > American lives.
2967 2018-11-22 19:09:40 I highly, highly, recommend the OCM (oil cleansing method) Once you can work out the tweaks, and balance that's best for you, it's a game changer truly. I converted 8 years ago and never looked back.
2968 2018-11-22 19:09:26 1) Find the oil
2) Steal the oil
3) Kill anyone else trying to steal the oil
4) Repeat
2969 2018-11-22 19:09:23 I found a recipe where you drizzle brussel sprouts and red grapes with olive oil salt and pepper. Roast them together in the oven then drizzle them with a balsamic glaze. That one is my favorite.

2974 2018-11-22 19:08:35 We don’t need their oil.  Besides, @realDonaldTrump, gas prices were cheaper under Obama.  That’s what we care about—not Mideast oil that your oligarchs invest in.
2975 2018-11-22 19:08:25 Hair oil use kren
2976 2018-11-22 19:08:23 I'm not knocking him; I think he is a great leader, full of ambition and love for his country. Ppl act like he took money from oil biz as payoffs, but I feel like his family (or wife's family) have friends who donated to his campaign because they believe in him.
2977 2018-11-22 19:08:22 Does trump think the American people believe his lies about oil prices what a moron
2978 2018-11-22 19:08:18 Snake oil may continually says this without factual basis
2979 2018-11-22 19:08:02 You do realise that animal agriculture is one of the greatest, if not THE greatest that to global warming. Banning a few plastic straws or producing less oil cannot compare to the millions of cows & pigs farmed & killed yearly. @herbivore_club @vivacampaigns @peta @rickygervais
2980 2018-11-22 19:07:52 1 of our cars is 2016 KIA Soul its a base model with 100k warranty free.I even have a so called life time warranty on powertan with lifetime oil changes for free. I paid like $14k new its supposedly worth 12k almost three years later. It is by no way luxary but I have other cars
2981 2018-11-22 19:07:40 I'm here to eat, not take a class on CBD oil, Karen.
2982 2018-11-22 19:07:38 I LOVE me some sprouts!!  Have you ever made "chips" out of the outer leaves? Toss with or spray with some oil and season and bake. Ohh sooo good!
2983 2018-11-22 19:07:32 currently getting a lavender essential oil IV drip.....fuck with me
2984 2018-11-22 19:07:23 Besides the fact that we only get about 10% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. We get 50% from Canada and Trump treats them like shit.
2985 2018-11-22 19:07:17 MsB is repugnant evil overindulged brat whose father gave him unmerited power to remove journalist who had temerity and tiniest way to speak out about what are universally acknowledged brutalities of this oil soaked area. Hideous that possibility exists for US to exculpate him.
2986 2018-11-22 19:07:04 we get twice as much oil from Canada as Saudi Arabia, yet Saudis can chop someone up and they get a free pass.
2987 2018-11-22 19:07:02 Lol - I wish Palm Oil wasn't such a risk to wildlife and that alternative fuel feedstocks weren't so manipulated by lobbyists. I wish that biodiesel optimized engines had been not shut down by Bluetec ... And Diesel gate related shtuff. I wish algae oil tech would break open. 4u
2988 2018-11-22 19:06:58 But we don't have one of the largest oil reserves in the world to burn through before we are forced to BBQ our pets
2989 2018-11-22 19:06:54 please try putting peppermint oil down everywhere.  Mice (and rats) hate it and will remove themselves from it fast

2991 2018-11-22 19:06:45 I told all the staff in the museum that I drove down the Broighter Road every week. One said "is Broighter a real place then"?! One short history & geography lesson later, they know the score now! I told all of them about Broighter Gold oil so hopefully some new customers!!
2992 2018-11-22 19:06:37 LETS IMPORT MORE OIL !!
2993 2018-11-22 19:06:35 How are you going to address the $260B in abandoned well liability that these hurting oil & gas drillers left behind?
2994 2018-11-22 19:06:30 are you trying to make a point or just lecturing me on oil and gas industry? we are not talking about that at all, we are talking about Trudeau not giving two fucks about Alberta, and that's a fact nobody can dispute, unlike his climate change/pollution claims
2995 2018-11-22 19:06:26 Watch out for any oil tankers and the odd rock guys!
2996 2018-11-22 19:06:21 Affordable housing was needed before the oil crash, I welcome it. Canadians supporting Canadians is a good thing, which is why we also need Ontario, Quebec and Maritimes to stop buying oil from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela and start buying it from Alberta.
2997 2018-11-22 19:06:21 We only get 9% of our oil from them. We get 40% from Canada, our largest supplier.  But sure lets shit on Canada but kiss that Saud ass.
2998 2018-11-22 19:06:16 Hey Original Oil Paintings(@BlairRussellArt), thank you for following me
2999 2018-11-22 19:06:14 Great claim by someone who doesn't drive, apparently doesn't read, and perhaps can't do arithmetic. Gas prices are the highest they've been in years. BTW, Saudi Arabia does not control world oil prices. When you congratulate them, that's FAKE NEWS!
3000 2018-11-22 19:06:06 Unfortunately, as the @JustinTrudeau government continues to block, delay, pipelines, many Albertan’s  will need to consider more affordable housing, not just those that really need help now; dirty Saudi Oil is cheaper for  right. #cdnpoli #ableg #yyc #yeg #Canada

3012 2018-11-22 19:04:53 Hey guys, Im frying a turkey, what kind of oil should I use? Looking for help. Thanks.
3013 2018-11-22 19:04:50 Does it contain Palm Oil?
3014 2018-11-22 19:04:49 That's because there are no crude oil flowing in those areas
3015 2018-11-22 19:04:47 We have to stop tying Nigeria's destiny to crude oil. Crude oil accounts for less than 12% of our GDP for heaven's sake!

See why we need a business driven Atiku? We need someone to wean us off crude oil. Government has to devise other revenue sources
3016 2018-11-22 19:04:42 If Trump is willing to overlook the murder of a journalist for lower oil prices, just think what price he'd put on your head #Khashoggi
3017 2018-11-22 19:04:37 Happy Thanksgiving from our Central Football family to yours! We are so thankful for all past, present & future Bears!                                                      Can’t wait to see everyone tomorrow at Lucas Oil to compete for that blue ring! #beatDwenger #GoBears 
3018 2018-11-22 19:03:51 Anyone having Black Friday deals for oil changes
3019 2018-11-22 19:03:50 Indeed, about 30% of Norway income depends on the Oil.
Also, it depends on the natural resources.

3022 2018-11-22 19:03:31 @LidlUK please can you reduce the use of parm oil in your products
3023 2018-11-22 19:03:28 Orwellian, ugly and dangerous. Built on oil wealth, destined to fail.

3025 2018-11-22 19:03:08 Yes! We want our Constitution as written... so you'll tell Whitaker to go back to selling snake oil and appoint Rosenstein acting AG?
3026 2018-11-22 19:02:50 Did you respond by telling tRump he’s an unthinking loon, that the U.S. gets <10% of its oil from Saudi Arabia, that the CIA has concluded that MBS had Khashoggi killed? Did you tell him he is a transparent liar? Please don’t be a receptacle for and rebroadcaster of tRump lies.
3027 2018-11-22 19:02:42 CBC- just in case Trump is not the history buff that his MAGA fanatics think he is, we’d like to point out that every time OPEC has cut production in order to drive up the price of oil — because that is the only cause and the only effect of doing so — it has been SA urging

3029 2018-11-22 19:02:09 Yes, it happened in between 1920s to 1960s. They betrayed Turks and joined Britain and lived a tough life during the period untill they started getting oil royalties.
My grand parents used to tell the old stories...
3030 2018-11-22 19:02:02 She's not just a noise maker. That woman is tough and not achieved what she has with the help of religion or tribe. Remove these things and see your leadership sink. We think we are doing the right thing because we have oil.
3031 2018-11-22 19:02:01 it's about 400 jobs and we get 40% of oil from Canada; only 9% from Saudis
3032 2018-11-22 19:01:57 We can be pretty certain why people voted for it - convincingly - in '75. Commonwealth wasn't working as a biddable source of materiel as had the Empire. Oil crisis. 3 day week, blackouts, petrol rationing threats... UK was an economic an social basket case. EEC was a lifeboat.

3035 2018-11-22 19:01:37 The Indian Government has said President Donald Trump's international destabilizing effects with a Trade War, Sanctions, Muslim Travel Ban etc leading to currency depreciation and high oil prices in India
3036 2018-11-22 19:01:33 But Saudi Arabia is still cutting production in order to raise oil prices.

3039 2018-11-22 19:01:15 Bruh, did the 1973 oil embargo not already prove that they could do that?
3040 2018-11-22 19:01:12 Hi @sainsburys I’ve just seen a graph which has showed me that you are the biggest supplier which contain the most parm oil in your products. Please can you reduce the use of parm oils and also it also showed yous have the most single use plastic products. It’s time for a change.

3042 2018-11-22 19:01:10 I'm worried that Trump won't pardon the turkey today, because turkeys don't have oil reserves and buy arms from the US.
3043 2018-11-22 19:01:04 Starting to outline potential approach for oil & gas sector. #Brazil’s incoming #Bolsonaro admin said to be considering changing pre-salt field oil auction model. Rather than production sharing, could move to concessions
3044 2018-11-22 19:00:54 It's not so much replacing the supply that's the problem it's the price we would have to pay that drives higher cost  US   Canadian and ironically Venezuelan oil production- fracking and sand oil is more expensive to produce and much more harmful to the environment

Or hiding from the rain in order to attend the Memorial for our fallen soldiers?
3048 2018-11-22 19:00:29 This is not about Trumps business, nor is it about oil prices. It is not about a cover up nor is it about protecting anyone.

3053 2018-11-22 19:00:06 Can't say much about the merits, but we used to have it in Norway for oil, and it didn't stop 1) the country swimming in money and 2) oil companies being super happy to work there.

Now it's a 78% industry corporate tax instead. Points above still stand.

3061 2018-11-22 18:59:43 We get 4X more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia
3062 2018-11-22 18:59:42 EV credits should only end when oil subsidies end. It's not been a fair competition from the start. Saying EVs should compete with ICE cars on their own is unfair. Either take both subsidies out or keep both.

Wake up.
3068 2018-11-22 18:59:04 But oil is why Trump loves the Saudis.
3069 2018-11-22 18:59:04 Saudi invests heavily in Trumps property and other Trump interests. Trump does not give a dam about others, oil or the USA. He only cares about himself
3070 2018-11-22 18:58:59 Not to mention that 40% of the US’ oil comes from Canada, and only 11% from the Saudis. Yet again, Trump tries to twist reality to make his evil palatable. How stupid do people have to be to accept his shit?!?!
3071 2018-11-22 18:58:57 I use a sugar infused coconut oil exfoliant on my h*le when I shower so my ass always stays sweet
3072 2018-11-22 18:58:56 I thought that it would have been a pint of blood per gallon? Considering one of an American citizen was murdered but was swept under the carpet for you to get your deal. So American blood for oil seems to be the norm for you!!!
3073 2018-11-22 18:58:53 Not mention the price of imported oil impacts the oil industry in the USA
3074 2018-11-22 18:58:51 You may think low oil prices are good but you are keeping thousands of hard working Americans out of a job by promoting $54/bbl oil. I don't agree with over $100/bbl oil but $70.00 - $80.00 bbl will keep everyone working! @realDonaldTrump
3075 2018-11-22 18:58:49 I lay the microwave facing up. Fill it with oil and then put the turkey in. It frys immediately.

3081 2018-11-22 18:58:15 I want the next Federal govt elected to fix two things:
The pipeline mess. We cant get our oil to market.
The defense procurement mess. We cant buy any needed military hardware for our personnel. Embarrassing.
3082 2018-11-22 18:58:14 @SlaterNFL Have him take Charlotte’s Web Hemp Extract CBD oil. It was created for use of a child with the very same problem. Serious. It would control & prevent the seizures. Look it up. Read for yourself. 
3083 2018-11-22 18:58:10 Okay....but what's in the mug?  is no oil plant based 
3084 2018-11-22 18:58:04 If you deep fry breaded things at the correct temperature they don’t absorb much oil at all.
3085 2018-11-22 18:58:04 I made the mistake of signing a petition on this stupid thing a while ago.

I can't even rembember what it was or how stoned I was.

It was probably something like "Sign this petition to stop vegans buying panda vegetable oil" or such shite.

Never again.
3086 2018-11-22 18:57:59 Totally! I feel so at home doing digital marketing. Definitely still flexing my engineering/problem solving skills, I also really enjoy the creative/people side of agency life more. That’s why I’m here and not working for an oil company anymore.
3087 2018-11-22 18:57:44 @Morrisons would like you to reduce the use of parm oil in your products, Same goes with other big suppliers
3088 2018-11-22 18:57:44 Obama wouldn’t drill and vetoed two pipelines. He was anti oil and gas. He wasted millions on solandra
3089 2018-11-22 18:57:44 Thanksgiving Day at the Moore's. Andi's first time shooting a 22. Evan shot the top clean off the bottle. And the oil boiled over.

3091 2018-11-22 18:57:24 No thanks to trump. Selling American lives for cheap oil. Whose next me dictator
3092 2018-11-22 18:57:09 Pass the oil please x
3093 2018-11-22 18:57:04 By the way trump has no control on the price of oil.. and we get 46% of our oil from canada not the saudis so we should be thanking trudeau
3094 2018-11-22 18:56:46 Have him take Charlotte’s Web Hemp Extract CBD oil. It was created for use of a child with the very same problem. Serious. It would control & prevent the seizures. Look it up. Read for yourself. 
3095 2018-11-22 18:56:35 Whole-foods plant-based no oil diet. Read about McDougall diet, Esselstyn diet, Greger diet dozen
3096 2018-11-22 18:56:34 No one cares how much a barrell of oil costs. We care what a gallon of gasoline costs at the pump. Currently, had one prices are at a r-year high.
3097 2018-11-22 18:56:34 My money says,they got more than oil prices on him.
3098 2018-11-22 18:56:32 There is a time lag between lower oil prices and gasoline prices due to the refinery supply chain. Gas at the pump today was from oil traded weeks or months ago. Nevertheless prices for both are directly linked.
3099 2018-11-22 18:56:30 Rubbed it down with salt and then olive oil and herbs. That slow apple smoke produces a nice juice bird.
3100 2018-11-22 18:56:25 Thanking the Saudi’s for their 11% imported oil while +40% is from Canada. He just wants his millions from them while risking his country’s reputation.
3101 2018-11-22 18:56:13 Blood of Khashoggi for a few drops of oil?
3102 2018-11-22 18:55:58 Thru the Burnaby passage, they can only take 80% of capacity. Most intercontinental oil shipments by tanker is done via much larger more cost efficient 2+ Million Barrel tankers.
3103 2018-11-22 18:55:37 They do know that his government approved pipelines and is pro oil and gas correct? The Supreme Court stalled the pipeline, for procedural reasons (they pushed it through too fast for proper consultations)
3104 2018-11-22 18:55:24 The oil can be as ethical as you want. When it's burned it still emits the same amount of carbon. Don't fool yourself into thinking otherwise.
3105 2018-11-22 18:55:22 On Thanksgiving before trump became president!  Come on... Anybody should know this statement is complete BS!  I don't understand how Trump supporters accept that he just put a price on a human being?  We don't get tons of oil from Saudi Arabia.  How do you get over all the lies
3106 2018-11-22 18:55:15 Since ERC began capping the oil dealers margin to a fixed amount per litre, there is no motivation to source for cheaper fuel. Just pick whatever is available.

Also, apart from the landing cost of fuel at the port, all other costs are fixed and charged per litre
3107 2018-11-22 18:55:02 You waking up in the morning upset because they accidentally stocked your private jet with the wrong flavor of ciroc.......dating some chick who drives a 2000 corolla that hasn't had an oil change since she bought it in 2013?

How? 
3108 2018-11-22 18:55:00 Buy Ecostyler (comes in small size for 200 dubious rd) mix with coconut oil(small size also) and do shingling or fingercoils(YouTube) .. You get curls that will last a month
That's when hair is wet
3109 2018-11-22 18:54:45 The real issue with Solar Energy is that it will drive the big oil multinationals/ economies out of business. They have therefore stifled it's growth and development

3112 2018-11-22 18:54:28 Excuse him he doesn't understand how the oil gas market works. The oil that made the gas in the pumps today was bought months ago long before he kissed the Saudis murder kings ass
3113 2018-11-22 18:54:27 Yess still in learning phase though. Thanksss. Water color aur oil work bhi dikhati hoon
3114 2018-11-22 18:54:27 Be sure, Mr Trump, that the Arab oil will continue to flow in your pockets, whether justice is done or not to Mohammed Bin Salman, in exchange for the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
3115 2018-11-22 18:54:24 People see the Iceland advert and suddenly start acting all concerned about palm oil when they’ve used/ eaten it all their lives. God forbid I show you what goes on in a slaughter house or where your Canada goose fur comes from....
3116 2018-11-22 18:54:14 And also I just want to say that if you consider yourself to be an environmental or social justice warrior and you participate in consumerism with large corporations then you are apart of the problem. Fashion in the second biggest waste of clean water, first is oil and gas.

3122 2018-11-22 18:54:00 Getting rid of OPEC would lead to lower oil prices in the short term and much higher prices long term after low prices bankrupt shale companies. And destroy the world stockmarkets as well! Great idea Congress!

3131 2018-11-22 18:52:54 Yep. They've been at it for a while, like cancelling the carbon storage funding. Trying to make us too wee too poor. And what do we do?  We keep finding oil!  Hahahahaha!
3132 2018-11-22 18:52:51 News that the scheduled Brexit summit on Sunday will proceed lifted GBP, but otherwise markets were lacklustre during the US holiday. US equity futures and European equities fell 0.8%, and oil fell 1.4%.
3133 2018-11-22 18:52:32 Per barrel is an oil price, not a gas price standard.  Not a genius, but don't sacrifice facts for bias either.
3134 2018-11-22 18:52:28 We all are with you but don't forget, it isn't only the oil, he knows he won't be POTUS forever, he needs Saudis money in the future for his family business.

3138 2018-11-22 18:52:17 Since Saudi Arabia only supplies 11% of our oil, and the price still isn't what it was in January of 2017, we can conclude that you love Saudi Arabia because they buy your properties!!!!!!!

3141 2018-11-22 18:51:50 Delete floprina flopbello canola oil stan
3142 2018-11-22 18:51:35 And the USA isn't run by crazy people who wanted to replace President  Assad with Wahhabi regime?  Congress passing law (Syria Train and Equip  Program) to establish religious law by the gun in Syria violated Constitution, 1st Amendment.  Oil is irrelevant to oaths of office.
3143 2018-11-22 18:51:26 Probably after our lifetime but when the oil runs out then we will see what happens.
3144 2018-11-22 18:51:15 If you had a clue under @realDonaldTrump you would know we have become the largest producer of oil and gas in the world move to China and get your solar panels
3145 2018-11-22 18:51:12 Steven on the larger point you are undoubtedly correct but let’s not let the lie about oil prices pass. SA wants to drive prices higher it is weakening global demand that is the reason for lower prices. #somanylies
3146 2018-11-22 18:51:11 Just salt and oil so far and some veggies and herbs on the pan. “Oh, is this ready?” A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY AND ALSO TURKEY
3147 2018-11-22 18:51:09 Wohi tou convo kr rahi hoon..
I worked with poster paints and oil pastels..
but I want to know more about water colours, acrylic and oil paints..and I really want to see art from these mediums...
3148 2018-11-22 18:51:08 Trump has revised the Lord's Prayer to, "Our who art in Saudi Arabia...give us this day our daily oil...Amen".
3149 2018-11-22 18:51:07 More of your lies!   Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
3150 2018-11-22 18:51:01 @EPAIreland hi I’m curious to know what can be done about some one leaking oil from the van all over the road also dumping old oil down the drain
3151 2018-11-22 18:50:58 Kind of? Main ingredient is wheat gluten. It actually tastes pretty good in the stuffing context, and crumbles nicely when you brown it in oil.
3152 2018-11-22 18:50:46 WHY PEANUT OIL SO EXPENSIVE
3153 2018-11-22 18:50:36 @claireperrymp 
Crude oil price as dropped repeatedly over the past month but this as not been past onto motorists. Unleaded shud b about £1.08 by now but it's still up above £1.20 why?
A lower petrol price helps keep inflation down. As MP responsible u shud b doing somat bout it
3154 2018-11-22 18:50:27 You should probably get your oil changed. No reason to do it yourself, however.
3155 2018-11-22 18:50:24 Well they got covered in oil and some herbs so.... Nutritious and delicious!
3156 2018-11-22 18:50:23 Reminiscent of the UN's flawed "Oil for Food Program"
3157 2018-11-22 18:50:22 Come on man you are the disaster let me remind you people will haunt you till you tell the world Bin Salman  is the perpetrator of Khashoggis death I feel u were bribed sir honestly speaking with due respect with the sudden fall in oil price like MAGIC
3158 2018-11-22 18:50:11 Heard of oil pulling? The latest craze in oral care, which involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth, has many proponents. However, the ADA notes that there have been no scientific studies to prove its benefits. Consult a dentist for all your dental hygiene questions. #dentist
3159 2018-11-22 18:50:07 Don't even use salt on mine. Bacon larding for the breast, and thyme oil for the basting.

3161 2018-11-22 18:49:52 Now its blood oil.....
3162 2018-11-22 18:49:51 no butter or oil on the skin, even??? no salt or pepper??? I'm judging your man so hard
3163 2018-11-22 18:49:49 Also agriculture only makes up for 10% of humans carbon footprint worldwide. Unclean energy sources like coal and oil make up for the lions share of the total human carbon footprint.

3166 2018-11-22 18:49:32 Low oil prices. Idk about u but gas is up $1 per gallon since trump took office
3167 2018-11-22 18:49:21 We only import 9% of our oil from Saudi Arabia! The ppl you should be thanking is Canada!! #impeach45
3168 2018-11-22 18:49:20 US fracked oil is considered to be equal to WTI or BRENT thus light oil for quality reasons, fracked oil is cost intensive thus the need for a basis price of 70 to even make a profit, if U noticed US production is now down...why fracked oil is not being pumped
3169 2018-11-22 18:49:19 OIL prices may have dropped. GASOLINE prices have not.
3170 2018-11-22 18:49:17 Turkey question: do you bring the bird up to room temperature before putting in oil, or do you just take it straight from refrigerator into oil?
3171 2018-11-22 18:49:14 At least pan cakes use flour and cooking oil which are affected by a rise in fuel prices but the nsenene guy doesn't use anything apart from an old saucepan!
3172 2018-11-22 18:49:04 みんなオイルが好きだよね⁇あん⁇嫌い⁇嫌いとか言うならオイル使われてる食品も製品も食べるなよ使うなよwwwwww? ガソリンもオイルだよ⁇www 車も乗るなよwww? 野菜だけ食ってろよwwww ベジタリアンテラワロスwwwwwww
3173 2018-11-22 18:49:00 I’m gonna try and sleep with oil in my hair. I hope I can wait till morning to wash my hair
3174 2018-11-22 18:48:47 That’s nothing to boast about. Fuck oil.
3175 2018-11-22 18:48:46 In the past year alone my mom has had to replace the oil burner and one of the ASTs. We re-dug the well about 15 years ago. I’m really praying the septic system holds.
3176 2018-11-22 18:48:42 Liar Liar Pants on Oil Fire.
3177 2018-11-22 18:48:33 Putting THC oil in the macaroni >:P
3178 2018-11-22 18:48:30 Also Sugar, Palm Oil, Alcohol, Insecticides, car fumes are MORE likely to kill you than weed. And we consume and come into contact with these things everyday....
3179 2018-11-22 18:48:18 Don’t lie. It’s about securing Middle East oil. Period.
3180 2018-11-22 18:47:55 They wouldn't, it's a federal system, so the one with the oil bailed out the one that overborrowed, and had no oil. No one noticed in practicality. Bit like Bavaria bailing out Shlesswig Holstein, for example.
3181 2018-11-22 18:47:54 idk if it’s just me but I love the smell when the peppers, onions & garlic first hit the hot oil. 
3182 2018-11-22 18:47:51 Blood for a little oil. Your corruption is all that you'll be remembered for. Accessory to murder is now added to the list of ways you've humiliated the People's House.
3183 2018-11-22 18:47:51 The problem isn’t really oil, it’s that the currency for the petrodollar, as basically decided by SA, is the USD. Say, tomorrow, they decided to change it to yen? Our economy would collapse. 

I’m anti-SA, as a citizen of the US and a Yemeni. But this is dangerous business.
3184 2018-11-22 18:47:50 It will be ,in every kitchen cupboard, global distribution and a cheaper substitute ,plus more environmentally friendly than oil based additives .
3185 2018-11-22 18:47:47 You don't have ANY control over oil prices President Dip-shite
3186 2018-11-22 18:47:41 A pox on the house of Saud! They're willing to fight terrorism all the up to and including the last dead American. We don't need the oil. Screw them.
3187 2018-11-22 18:47:34 And that little bag of olive oil splashes on every mothafuka
3188 2018-11-22 18:47:33 Shout out to Keona with the peanut oil who was ready to risk it all in front or her bf  but I’m not that “cute”
3189 2018-11-22 18:47:29 How about invite @VodkWhiteWaters to the oil city
3190 2018-11-22 18:47:29 Haan To Sab Aur Isme  Fark Hai.. Sabko Ko Dekh Ke Lagta Hai Chameli Oil Hai Aur Isko Dekh Ke Lagta Waah Kya Hair Style Hai 
3191 2018-11-22 18:47:23 What gets me is this is a CANADIAN crisis, with the epicentre in Alberta. Time for the narrative to swing and get the whole county aware. By the way Ottawa - you cannot even balance your own chequebook !!!!  You might need Alberta oil money!!  VOTE THEM OUT on Oct 2019!!
3192 2018-11-22 18:47:17 We get very very little of our oil from Saudi Arabia, but MAGAts probably don’t know that.  sad
3193 2018-11-22 18:47:10 I chop am this afternoon u no show , that puff puff carry plenty oil
3194 2018-11-22 18:47:09 Dubbles with an MVP take. Honestly though. Saute the diced onions, chopped celery, and the carrots in some oil with a touch of minced garlic until aromatic. Throw some chicken stock in there until it boils. Turn that shit off, then toss it in the bottom of your roasting pan.
3195 2018-11-22 18:47:00 Don, if we let them slaughter a few more journalists can we make many more billions and many more oil....
3196 2018-11-22 18:46:56 Anyway, the earlier (Hough and Page) paper considered the spatial and temporal association between oil production and early quakes; this paper develops models to consider quantitatively how oil withdrawal would have perturbed stress at seismogenic depths.
3197 2018-11-22 18:46:55 Oil versus blood!  Oil wins!
3198 2018-11-22 18:46:54 If you want to know the real truth about this government's opinion of Alberta oil, just go to the achives of Butts and Justin...It explains everything.

BTW- What happened to that pipeline the government just purchased under 6 mths ago?
3199 2018-11-22 18:46:53 Oh now you finally know what you posted!!  Congrats, give the boy gold star. 

Gillesn, you are nothing more than a useful idiot for the oil lobby.  You can't even tell the difference between the taxes we pay and the taxes they pay!

3201 2018-11-22 18:46:43 Matt Stafford is currently giving thanks for Khalil Mack not turning him into an oil stain on the field after that recovery/run back . He’s also thankful for extra pairs of underwear. Happy thanksgiving.

3204 2018-11-22 18:46:38 thanksgiving consists of your four fathers of the family (all the gramps & great gramps) spending 2 hours discussing the oil usage in a 2 cylinder chainsaw vs a 4 cylinder chainsaw. wth
3205 2018-11-22 18:46:35 Like we didn't see what happened at Guatemala /Mexican border.
 If the same happened here, she would be critical no action was taken to protect those  manning ports of entry.
3206 2018-11-22 18:46:30 "He's now thanking a dictatorship that just murdered a US-resident journalist-,-for suppressing the price of oil. #ableg"
It kept reading to me as SA murdered th guy whut suppressed the price of oil, although, if SA did murder a guy who suppressed oil prices, the US *might* be PO

3212 2018-11-22 18:45:53 That's utter nonsense, there is enough oil for next 100 years
3213 2018-11-22 18:45:43 Saudi is a small bit player, sells US a tiny fraction of oil + is beating up our Middle East ally, Qatar.  O+ funded the 9/11 attacks.

@realDonaldTrump is blowing up American values, security because unlike our actual allies — whom he rails against — the rulers buy @Trump 
3214 2018-11-22 18:45:38 Great...... so India is now strong enough to influence @WorldBank ,and also  @MoodysInvSvc to upgrade India. also to influence  international oil prices.kudos to @PMOIndia .

3216 2018-11-22 18:45:32 It isn't a dying industry. Because Canadian oil is landlocked, done by the dipstick Trudeau, we're selling for one-quarter what other countries get for their oil.
3217 2018-11-22 18:45:28 COSMO: Rarely use a massage oil.

3221 2018-11-22 18:45:17 What does your Hispanic mother shout when oil from the pan pops on her arm?

Mine: “ouch MOTHERFUCKER”
3222 2018-11-22 18:45:16 I had to resort to boiling eggs with a bit of olive oil then rapidly cooling them just to have them peel half way decent.

My fresh eggs peeled fine without the oil added
3223 2018-11-22 18:45:08 Thankful for CBD oil 
3224 2018-11-22 18:45:07 40% of US oil comes from Canada and only 11% comes from Saudi Arabia, why are you giving Canada such a hard time and praissing Saudi Arabia?
3225 2018-11-22 18:45:03 Replace vegetable oil (the horror!) with Irish butter and you’re all good.

3232 2018-11-22 18:44:41 Lower oil prices actually hurts my business...
3233 2018-11-22 18:44:40 My son does turkey like this. Takes a few minutes to dip them in a deep cooker, full of oil and other stuff. It's quite good and moist. But there is a trick to timing.
3234 2018-11-22 18:44:38 Over 90% of government revenue in the past 40yrs is from crude oil
3235 2018-11-22 18:44:36 Agreed.  Why there isn’t wide spread calls for his removal is beyond me. Also, the  purchases almost 40% of their oil from....(drum roll please) us in .  Just sayin...
3236 2018-11-22 18:44:29 A large portion of 45 $ support is from energy ind. Large invest in LTO, requiring +60 WTI for FCF, is losing $ with every 45 tweet and effort to reduce the $ of oil. If Energy sector loses $, less for 45, and less for economy, fewer votes, net loss for GOP. $60 - 70 is balanced.

3240 2018-11-22 18:44:20 While the whole map is a disgrace, I’m struck by the change in Oklahoma. Oil interests always win.
3241 2018-11-22 18:44:19 Lower oil prices lead to lower gas prices. Gasoline is just refined oil. Gas prices have been falling sharply ever since @realDonaldTrump criticized OPEC for the high prices.
3242 2018-11-22 18:44:15 Mix castor oil with your foundation. You’re welcome.
3243 2018-11-22 18:44:14 most things dont actually need oil though, because say frozen oven chips usually have some oil on them. Pizza doesnt need oil, many ready snacks dont need oil etc. Its not many things that actually require it.
3244 2018-11-22 18:44:13 Lavender oil is the best and it works fast
3245 2018-11-22 18:43:58 Lmao.... the Saudis are a really stupid lot.....
So eager to murder an innocent man that you had to do it in your consulate...
And do a stupidly botched cover up while spinning off too many stories..

Well, they have oil. They can do as they please 
3246 2018-11-22 18:43:58 No mention of oil from the federal govt. Update a nothing burger.
3247 2018-11-22 18:43:56 Yea it’s doing you good! I went back to using noxema, I used to use it in high school had real good skin, my skin still okay  but I’m definitely back in my glow with that and coconut oil
3248 2018-11-22 18:43:41 And why the people in Atlantic Canada pay through the nose for oil, gas etc.
3249 2018-11-22 18:43:40 When my daughter was 6 we kept her hair coated in olive oil for a week = excellent. When she was 16 there was a great deal of nit picking & some harsh chemicals. My son just shaved his head. Also, excellent. Those bugs made me scream & cry a little. Awesome you 
3250 2018-11-22 18:43:35 Oil prices aren't the only thing they've slashed.
3251 2018-11-22 18:43:32 Blue colour. Venetian, INDIAN AND TUSCAN REDS, ETC. These colours may be used in oil.
3252 2018-11-22 18:43:29 ur so ignorant...u don't even know how oil prices work. haha  maybe saudi arabia can explain it to u,
3253 2018-11-22 18:43:20 It's been a great journey of discovery! And the oil is flowing in the kitchen. As fine as gold. X

3255 2018-11-22 18:42:59 Samsu oil prevents premature ejaculation,it's pure herbal with no side effects and also corrects erectile dysfunction! Makes you last longer without losing erection
3256 2018-11-22 18:42:51 So if it is Fake News, then why are you worried about what they say again?  Oh, also way to ignore the murder of a journalist to help keep oil prices low.  Like, seriously, have you no conscience?
3257 2018-11-22 18:42:40 No blood on that oil
3258 2018-11-22 18:42:18 I heard that peppermint oil wards off mice. I put cotton balls with oil around the house and now it smells like Christmas in here and my sinuses are clear. A+.

3261 2018-11-22 18:41:47 Lies, This is the US Presidents first tweet on Thanksgiving Day.

Check your facts 9%  of oil from Saudi.

New jobs about 20 a year

Obama worked out this trade deal, of 14.5B  would be in payments. So far not much action on it, unable to refit.

How much Trump Org will lose.
3262 2018-11-22 18:41:32 Just like electricity trading we have spot prices for different markets. Current the EU market is 7usd/B higher than the US market and this is because if entirely OPEC internal regulation. But the oil prices haven’t been the best this year we even got to 80/B at some point.
3263 2018-11-22 18:41:23 Literally the minimal I would expect is for him to say nothing. Instead he literally thanks a government that ordered the murder of a us resident and also the death of the team sent to kill said journalist. Also we don’t import that much of their oil anyways.
3264 2018-11-22 18:41:10 He thinks the steam that powers a nuclear aircraft carrier is generated by coal! I’m sure he wonders where all the oil we buy goes since most cars run on gasoline.
3265 2018-11-22 18:41:08 Who's missing because that oil change is not going to happen by itself.
3266 2018-11-22 18:41:00 Fry that bad boy up with some peanut oil
3267 2018-11-22 18:40:57 Yes but the price of oil was lowered. Now we know what a journalists life is worth.
3268 2018-11-22 18:40:46 kk guys this simple salad recipe u would think ur eating at a RESTAURANT: mixed greens, red delicious apple, dried cranberries, praline nuts, olive oil, apple cider vinegar + mustard powder. UR WELCOME!!!!!!
3269 2018-11-22 18:40:46 For those protesting in Calgary. Remember the Trudeau Family has interests in OIL. Pay attention there is always a flip side to what Trudeau does. Pay attention to what he isn't saying... He's smooth, had a good teacher. Pierre

3275 2018-11-22 18:40:20 You got to do what you got to do until the morons get the pipes built let's get the oil moving
3276 2018-11-22 18:40:16 Neighbor had some extra oil 
3277 2018-11-22 18:40:13 I can’t wait for the day that all the oil runs out in Saudi Arabia
3278 2018-11-22 18:40:13 Niggas dead ass copping for woke points like you ain't on the reservation shooting oil riggers so what are you doing? Oh nothing? Stfu and eat your turkey doofus
3279 2018-11-22 18:40:11 Getting oil changed... gonna be like 4 hrs 
3280 2018-11-22 18:40:10 ثلاثة أحداث لو تعرضت لها أي دولة لكانت حكومتها قد قدمت استقالتها ولعقدت المحاكمات تلو المحاكمات لمحاسبة المسؤولين عنها:
١-غتيال جمال خاشقجي رحمه الله.
٢-تصريح ترامب حول حماية السعودية لإسرائيل.
٣- التحرش بالمعتقلات.

3281 2018-11-22 18:40:06 Premade graham crust completely broke apart so I pulverized it to crumbs and reformed it with some coconut oil and egg replacer. That's basically like making your own crust, right?

3284 2018-11-22 18:39:52 STOP letting niggas with dirty finger nails play in your pussy  you had a UTI for 3 week & don’t know why...Cause you got backwoods, motor oil, weed flakes, mayo, ketchup & lemon pepper seasoning in you hoe 
3285 2018-11-22 18:39:51 Iran was America's ally after the overthrow of the then ruler to reinstate Iranian monarchy in the twentieth century, for oil. Sounds a bit like America's current relationship with Saudi Arabia. The relationship with Iran ended badly, I would suggest the same with happen again
3286 2018-11-22 18:39:48 Whatever you need cuticle oil for those crusty fingers!!
3287 2018-11-22 18:39:43 because all big oil companies started to job cuts and cancelling all summer schools/interships. Maybe i'll return this field but with programming side :)
3288 2018-11-22 18:39:32 @RachelNotley I would have a little more respect for you if you used proper terms used in the oil field such as ‘shit’ to describe the PM, you are allowed to say that on TV
3289 2018-11-22 18:39:22 Our Active Fryer was free with PC Points.   Tiny bit of oil is all good.
3290 2018-11-22 18:39:20 40 + 12 = 52%
How much do we produce domestically?. Just curious .
But I bet we still buy some for other countries that are not too different that the Saudis. 
Actually, if we look at oil producing countries , I'm sure many if them have not democracies,  at least close to ours.
3291 2018-11-22 18:39:15 I'm all for sending Fox News personnel to Turkey to get to the bottom of this.  Who? Why, ALL of them. Let's get oil to $25 a barrel y'all.
3292 2018-11-22 18:39:01 working with oil inside my room means staining all of my shit with random ass colors 
3293 2018-11-22 18:38:56 Except when it comes to oil and the Saudis.
3294 2018-11-22 18:38:47 Lol. I go dye 
3295 2018-11-22 18:38:36 These are serious issues. Remember when oil was $45 dollars a barrel but here a litre of petrol was over ksh 90
3296 2018-11-22 18:38:29 my mom was going through my things and found my hidden spot, she asked my why i had hand cuffs, massage oil, and ropes... i just laughed 
3297 2018-11-22 18:38:27 The much-loathed "National Energy Program" was a good idea for Canada. The US "banned" the export of crude oil in 1975-2015 (40 years) and made primary producers sell feedstock to US refineries at a discount. That's partly why we Canadians are getting shafted now. #cdnpoli
3298 2018-11-22 18:38:26 Is it oil just like us !
3299 2018-11-22 18:38:25 그게 훨 낫겠다 짜증만 나...
3300 2018-11-22 18:38:15 Make salad dressing! Mix 3 parts olive oil with 1 part rice vinegar and 1 part miso. Add parsley and molasses to taste.
3301 2018-11-22 18:38:10 Oil money
3302 2018-11-22 18:38:10 I care more about the morality of allying with murderous dictators. Investigate the Khashoggi murder, forget the oil prices.
3303 2018-11-22 18:38:09 @katesang it appears that 2 of the @LidlUK mince pies are also palm oil free (not the all butter ones)

3305 2018-11-22 18:38:07 But the asparagus is amazing.  Asparagus. Fresh Garlic. Olive Oil. Salt and Pepper. Fresh Lemon juice. And crispy bacon. All sauteed in a pan of deliciousness.

3307 2018-11-22 18:37:47 So many analyst complaining that Trump is making it difficult to analyse the oil market. Sorry, but this is exactly time to show your skills as an analyst, the more complicated, the more input to consider, the better.
3308 2018-11-22 18:37:40 Getting all my clothes ironed & prepped for the rush tomorrow morning...even bathing & shaving now so in morning I'm fresh with just a quick wash & brushing of the teeth & I'm gone...petrol filled & oil,water & tyre pressure checked!

3310 2018-11-22 18:37:16 #JamalKhashoggi gets murdered... CIA confirms Prince of Saudi ordered the killing.. 3 days later oil prices drop 45%? Theory - trumps tells the prince if you dont want to get bombed how are you gonna fix this? 1 death = millions benefit from oil prices. The american way. #fucked
3311 2018-11-22 18:37:15 وش قصته ؟
3312 2018-11-22 18:37:12 Praise like oil
3313 2018-11-22 18:37:12 Isn’t it like flour and butter/oil cooked?
3314 2018-11-22 18:37:10 진짜 그 전작들도 그렇고 어떻게 만화 스토리를 이렇게 못 짜는지..
3315 2018-11-22 18:37:06 We should be wondering why we import any oil to refine instead of using domestic supply.
3316 2018-11-22 18:36:58 Never realized how bad the oil prices have gotten in Alberta. Too bad those refineries we sell to in the states have shut down at the moment
3317 2018-11-22 18:36:56 I want to rub olive oil on ur head and slap it around a lil
3318 2018-11-22 18:36:53 It doesn’t work very well in my experience. You can use stock to flavor and make base with butter or oil and flour
3319 2018-11-22 18:36:49 If you go by a standard? So killing is ok as long as the money keeps flowing. Btw Canada ships more oil to you than Saudi Arabia.
3320 2018-11-22 18:36:48 It is absolutely NOT the case that "I refused to accept aid that could support my word," making the NEXT OBVIOUS assertion that "this provides all the 'proof' they need! NO! NO! NO! (Also cannot stress enough, LOTS OF DIRTY PALM OIL in LOTS OF DIFFERENT MANUFACTURED FORMS!)
3321 2018-11-22 18:36:44 poison and oil are flammable, but water magic will put fire out, and you can electrocute water. fire turns ice into steam, water can wash away poison, etc. melee combat is there and does high damage, but no synergies like that
3322 2018-11-22 18:36:43 Edik og tea tree oil 
3323 2018-11-22 18:36:42 What is your perception of Saudi influence on worlds oil prices (hint OPEC)? 
3324 2018-11-22 18:36:42 Do not think for a second that this has anything to do with oil or arms, this is all about Trump and Kushner business dealings!
3325 2018-11-22 18:36:40 Dear President Corrupt:
It's not about oil.  
You export far more from Canada.
It's about the cash your corrupt Klan makes from Snotty Arabia.
Prison is the only place you deserve.
Rather fitting that Orange is the new Black
3326 2018-11-22 18:36:35 Just silly bits.
Swapping shampoo with frying oil?
Putting piss in the cauldron that snivelus has to drink at his OWL-exam?
Just simple pranks....
3327 2018-11-22 18:36:33 me: [wears the same pants five days in a row, doesn’t get haircuts, never wears makeup, washes my face with Dove soap]

also me: YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE BENEFITS OF USING JOJOBA OIL ON YOUR CUTICLES 
3328 2018-11-22 18:36:33 That’s why you gotta deep fry a turkey. Outside, it’s cold so no one bothers you, and the smell gets covered by the hot oil.
3329 2018-11-22 18:36:28 I hope Canadians realize that Putin,Trump are attempting to gain control of Oil Reserves across the World, including Canada, via the Conservative Parties "Politics"
Russia's Ukraine incursion, backing Syria. Fact check for yourself!
3330 2018-11-22 18:36:27 “that low oil prices were a key reason not to punish Saudi.” This is where he tells the truth
3331 2018-11-22 18:36:24 Elaborate please
3332 2018-11-22 18:36:23 "FREE"   advice for your health ! Take Flax seed oil everyday because it  has more omega 3's than omega 6's.  Omega 3's  inhibit inflammation,  whereas omega 6's increase inflammation.  Fish and fish oils contain  more omega 3's but they may also contain mercury or radiation
3333 2018-11-22 18:36:16 Why hasn't Trudeau said anything about Saudi Arabia? Sill selling them arms still buying their oil while shutting our people out of work and killing our industry. 
Very selective fake news CBC. Trudeau paid you well for your treason to the people.

3335 2018-11-22 18:36:14 In excess of 13,000 barrels of oil delivered so far....hype? Some peeps would describe black as white

3337 2018-11-22 18:36:00 The oil glut is temporary.
Your sanctions on Iran will see to that.
The increased production is payment from Saudi Arabia for your willingness to ignore MbS' brutal murder.
Again it is only temporary!

3338 2018-11-22 18:35:57 Chamomile essential oil or whatever my current fave soothing scent is, just a little  before bed & in the am-instant grounding/comfort for me. Also a cozy extra warm layer & caffeine of some sort.
3339 2018-11-22 18:35:48 Pork chops in a marinade of soy sauce, brown sugar, ketchup (ssh), green onion, ginger chunks, and sesame oil.
3340 2018-11-22 18:35:41 Yes,  actually,  being Saudia Arabia's bitch is putting America first.  

Without their oil,  the eagle can't fly.   Let's get Syriana,  real here.
3341 2018-11-22 18:35:38 Let me enjoy Your goodness, Lord—the wheat, the wine, and the oil -Jer. 31:12 #Prayer
3342 2018-11-22 18:35:30 That is an outstanding question and one we should all be asking. I am sure at the root of it is that someone somewhere is making a lot of money by keeping our own oil out of our own refineries.
3343 2018-11-22 18:35:25 I have no clue, never watch Fox Business or any of the talking heads anymore:) I get my news from Twitter mostly...I just think it's so bizarre that so many US consumers think we're so dependent on Saudi Oil when we're not..that was maybe 20-30 years ago:)
3344 2018-11-22 18:35:24 On another note what when current administration came in front and supported @flyspicejet revival by directing oil companies to accept credit with staggered payments. Similar approach with @AAI_Official airports and finally With DGCA to allow forward bookings
3345 2018-11-22 18:35:11 We love how passionate you are about Palm Oil. We are too. Limited on word count via Twitter do you have an email address we could email you on with regards to our policies. The short of it is, all the Palm Oil used by our manufacturers in our products is sustainably sourced...
3346 2018-11-22 18:35:00 @RepAdamSchiff @SenFeinstein @SenKamalaHarris @SenBlumenthal Please take this warning seriously !  Time to get serious about our oil uses.  Even, me, an old grgranmother knew the danger of continued drilling years ago! Please do something now.
3347 2018-11-22 18:34:59 Because it is not about oil prices; it’s about Trump business!!!!
3348 2018-11-22 18:34:57 Well Oil me up, throw me in an oven, heat it up and call me ButterIsTurkey. Feels bad man
3349 2018-11-22 18:34:56 Really? Carbon Tax driving up the price on everything, less people working, oil prices in the toilet. Are you day drinking?

"B!TCH"!!
3353 2018-11-22 18:34:13 About the same in Canada. $1.34 L. That’s about $6.03 a gallon.  Plus we supply the US with over 40% of their crude oil. Saudi supplies about 19%   Go figure

3355 2018-11-22 18:34:05 I was being facetious when I mentioned camels, the technology for electric has been around for over 100 years, but research and development has been suffocated because of gas and oil revenues, The Hemp plant has many uses could replace plastics and it's biodegradable

3357 2018-11-22 18:33:55 That doesn't answer the question of why the east coast doesn't use east coast oil. I realize that under NAFTA the US gets it, however it seems silly.
3358 2018-11-22 18:33:49 @hondaindia Honda is given free service only to change lub oil and cleaning nothing else.Starting Problem of ma Grazia not resolved after 2nd service.Plz all Grazia user take an add Halogen Light because Grazia Head Lamp is like Diwali LED, visibility in nightNt exptd frm Honda
3359 2018-11-22 18:33:45 And once again the oil producers of this country get to steal the Canadian Oil from the people. If anyone can afford these taxes, it's the oil companies that are not willing to give up #dividends but will gladly take Canadian's tax payer's money without blinking.
3360 2018-11-22 18:33:42 YOU are such a stupid fucking idiot, claiming that YOU lowered oil prices.   JESUS FUCKING CHRIST, you are a MORON!!!!!!
3361 2018-11-22 18:33:38 Wonder how much of this is the oil selloff?
3362 2018-11-22 18:33:31 Fried Oyster Mushrooms with Wild Rice and Gravy. I fried it in grapeseed oil with spelt flour. It gave me hope especially after i tasted it and was like, oh this actually tastes like food. Good food at that 
3363 2018-11-22 18:33:22 Oh it does and it's spectacular.  Just a dab of oil and yummy city
3364 2018-11-22 18:33:22 I need help guys. I have to shave off my beard but I need to grow it back before X'mas. Any beard oil/spray suggestions or recommendations?
3365 2018-11-22 18:33:20 On my first job out of college I did analysis of three cut oil exchanges....
3366 2018-11-22 18:33:10 Atlantic oil can sell anywhere and therefore is priced at global market prices.   It’s also not constrained in pipeline capacity.   Now we sell everything that’s available to the US and they move it onward reaping all the rewards

3370 2018-11-22 18:32:33 Yes reducing oil usage on the world stage is the only answer & efforts should be spent on reducing the world population to a sustainable population that the planet can support #climateaction #globalwarming #cdnpoli
3371 2018-11-22 18:32:31 Most of our oil comes from Canada, not Saudi Arabia.
3372 2018-11-22 18:32:27 No, they don't. Oil companies and manufacturers and all sorts of companies have been lobbying for decades to suppress climate legislation
3373 2018-11-22 18:32:26 I disagree-he chooses not to “understand “ or believe” because it doesn’t make him money from the coal & oil industries
3374 2018-11-22 18:32:21 It’s funny you look just like that dude 
3375 2018-11-22 18:32:18 Guys like Trump are pulling for this one. There are yuge oil reserves in those Arctic waters.
3376 2018-11-22 18:32:16 I don’t blame u ...it is the spiritual food ( eko and palm oil) that your spiritual wife in those ur dreams has been feeding u that is making u say all this one
3377 2018-11-22 18:32:01 Ottawa Ottawa Ottawa ... Look outside your bubble... Why have you not addressed the largest oil spill in history on Canada's east coast happening right now??   I thought you were appointed the " minister of environment ".
3378 2018-11-22 18:32:01 I think you have to find reasons why you eat or don’t eat type of food and then it becomes easier. We don’t eat anything with added oil or sugar ... watch how much that cuts out 
3379 2018-11-22 18:31:58 To displace the need of importing oil from places like Venezuela. Irving refinery completed upgrades in order to refine heavy oil in anticipation of EE going through. Now that it has been cancelled they are getting heavy oil from Venezuela by tankers. That is why.
3380 2018-11-22 18:31:58 I always saw them advertised as 'oilless fryers' so just assumed that actually using oil would be bad for the inner lining, nice to know it's still an option
3381 2018-11-22 18:31:38 People don't understand the science that they have withheld from us...we could be driving on water producing hydrogen which produces water and then water produces hydrogen never ever ever again do we have to buy oil.
Electrolysis anyone?

3384 2018-11-22 18:31:07 Stop attacking on fundamental values that governs humanity in exchange for money..Did I just hear from you that you traded rule of law and respect for life with lowering oil price?  You must be just talking to the oil hungry polluters who cares nothing  but oil price....Pathetic
3385 2018-11-22 18:30:55 Waaaat?  Delete this tweet Biko. 

Yam and red oil? With salt sprinkled on it, onions and pepper if you like?  Don't provoke me.
3386 2018-11-22 18:30:52 Sounds like Chamberlain’s plolicy of appeasement with Hitler. Yet this same Trump, wanted a Muslim travel ban. So... Iran bad, Saudi good? So is it not race or religion, just oil?
3387 2018-11-22 18:30:39 Obama's balanced policies dropped gas prices far more w/out tanking the market. Between the crash of stocks overvalued by record level stock buy backs via the GOP tax cut & the oil overproduction market crash my 401k's growth for the yr has been wiped out. You are an epic idiot.
3388 2018-11-22 18:30:30 America sells them weapons and Saudi oil we lose a lot of money if we didn’t sell
3389 2018-11-22 18:30:27 Guys like Trump are pulling for this one. There are huge oil reserves in those Antarctic waters.

3391 2018-11-22 18:30:11 olive oil and crack black pepper rub just went on it. it's got 2 hours before it goes in the oven, so it's just sitting covered.
3392 2018-11-22 18:30:10 The only reason we suck up to country like these is bc oil.
And it's very sad that this country has done nothing to cut that dependency.
3393 2018-11-22 18:30:05 Are there any oil and gas companies left in Alberta?  I hear they are all in Texas drilling for black gold.
3394 2018-11-22 18:30:05 so hairspray is worst for the environment than oil rigs? OK

3396 2018-11-22 18:29:39 You are such a fool and a useful idiot.  

While we pay £££ in duties they get £££ in tax breaks.  Then we have pay extra taxes to make up the missing £££ because we gave it away as tax breaks to Big Oil.

Heads we lose, tails they win. And you are the fool.
3397 2018-11-22 18:29:39 I see you have children, explain to them how gutting regulations for clean air, water, and land works in 25 years, when they have none. When there is no oil left in 50 years, and we have invented anything to replace it, when the planet is uninhabitable
3398 2018-11-22 18:29:23 Genuinely Curious, and I admit have only recently started following oil. How is Trump ‘sawing away’...?  And connect that to lower oil prices.
3399 2018-11-22 18:29:17 Because the companies that drill and the companies that refine are run separately.   

The refiners like Saudi oil because it is lower in sulfur than US oil.  But they could use US oil if they had too.
3400 2018-11-22 18:29:09 Oil city who is here............. Port Harcourt let's link up
3401 2018-11-22 18:29:08 Atlantic Canada produces oil, yet it's sold to the US. I'm not sure why it would be necessary to run a pipeline from West to East.
3402 2018-11-22 18:29:08 Our corporate owners such as big oil, big coal, big internet, big food, big Pharma, big insurance, don't care what the President does now, they got what they wanted right away TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX CUTS AND PRO GREED POLICIES...
3403 2018-11-22 18:28:57 They got oil and US is most shameless blood hound in history.
3404 2018-11-22 18:28:56 Looking good. And no dangerous oil fires. Nice job.
3405 2018-11-22 18:28:55 Ciekawa odmiana robienia kotleta. Pewne elementy tej tchniki srobuje na meza kotlecie. Co do smalcu na patelni, to juz nie. Dopuszczam tylko extra virgin's olive oil.
3406 2018-11-22 18:28:42 You would be able to drop them in a pan of oil and do that but at that point I'd do it on the stove, so I see the appeal there
3407 2018-11-22 18:28:38 I could get behind that. I do my usual obscene amount of olive oil along with a small amount of butter for flavor, but coconut milk could work.
3408 2018-11-22 18:28:33 We had no problem with Saddam killing people (we even sold him weapons) until he threatened to use his countries oil production to manipulate the market and drive up prices.
3409 2018-11-22 18:28:27 Sounds like BP’s logic with the oil spill.
3410 2018-11-22 18:28:26 You clearly know NOTHING about geo-politics. As soon as there's any blip or uncertainty in stable Middle East nations oil prices spike. Stick to tweeting about how pathetic charter schools are.
3411 2018-11-22 18:28:24 Will be interested to hear what they say Dara. 
Palm Oil ,meat from Ex rainforest  or anything else, I just want  large scale deforestation to stop so orangutans and other forest wildlife can live in peace.
3412 2018-11-22 18:28:23 ليش ما لك تقدير كل مواطن له تقديره واحترامه عند الحكومه لا الفاسدين اللة عزوجل احل قتلهم
3413 2018-11-22 18:28:12 it’s true that little bromide about tryptophan is a myth but your correction is incorrect. it’s a mixed of the ***simple carbs and sugar which cause a spike/crash & was the heavy fat/oil content of the food which causes sluggish metabolism and literally slowly blood flow
3414 2018-11-22 18:28:10 Truffle oil in the mashed taters
3415 2018-11-22 18:28:08 So right now it’s a battle of two smells going on in one part of my house. 

The kitchen area has the smell of beef stew in a slow cooker.

The living room area has the smell of peppermint from my essential oil diffuser.

The combination at times is interesting to say the least.
3416 2018-11-22 18:28:08 Housing is down, oil is down, Canadian dollar is Down, industry is fleeing, Calgary downtown is empty and this minister is in Ottawa for more than four years and did nothing and shows his work for Alberta . Albertans don’t need u and your fake promises.. sorry liberals ..
3417 2018-11-22 18:27:58 Oh biasa lah tu i understand. Kalau lepas u pakai the next dah takde burn which means okey kot. I pernah pakai tea tree oil (probably too much) muka i mcm terbakar
3418 2018-11-22 18:27:55 If we are the largest producer of oil in the world, why is gasoline in KSA $0.90 a gallon?
3419 2018-11-22 18:27:48 A week oil industry just leads to orphan wells & pipelines. It also makes no sense to ship our oil by train. Stopping #TransMountain is only going to increase #railroad  shipments. A health oil sector is good for the environment.
3420 2018-11-22 18:27:47 That and if you had half the planet's oil supply
3421 2018-11-22 18:27:47 Renewables. Keep oil in the ground.
3422 2018-11-22 18:27:44 just remember you want as little ventilation as possible, otherwise the air will siphon away the energy from the fuel and you'll have the oil equivalent of shooting blanks
3423 2018-11-22 18:27:35 For example you couldn't cut fresh potato fries and then put them in a convection oven with oil? or could you? I don't think so if I understand how those work.
3424 2018-11-22 18:27:29 ini pengalaman pribadi sih, jadi mukaku berminyak tapi cuma disekitaran hidung. trus ada komedo gitu. nah aku sering pake baby oil disekitaran area hidung buat ngatasing komedo, tapi aku ngerasa area itu ga berminyak lagi semenjak rajin make baby oil.
3425 2018-11-22 18:27:28 Oil crisis. What does that suggest to you? Doubling down the province’s future on an industry in crisis, apparently. #followingnotleading doesn’t get any better than this.
3426 2018-11-22 18:27:25 It should be uncomfortable. We in the U.K. (and elsewhere) smile and take their money (and oil) without a thought or consideration for the often horrendous human rights situation ongoing in these states every day. Nothing to see here. Morality goes out of the window.
3427 2018-11-22 18:27:21 Liar. The President doesn’t have anything to do with gas pricing. And your friend in Saudi Arabia and OPEC are going to decrease oil production in Dec. Gonna take the blame when gas prices go up??
3428 2018-11-22 18:27:19 Being that everyone is crying about Co2 and natural disasters instead of lack of funding for renewables while we susibize oil companies im not sure were to the ‘no shit’ point in this conversation.
3429 2018-11-22 18:27:15 Bro kindly follow back pls. Oil dey head
3430 2018-11-22 18:27:09 @lyricaldrsmith1 big up bro. Listening to u right now on MaloneyFM Keffi.

More oil!
3431 2018-11-22 18:27:08 The lives of American residents in return for loans to Trump business and lower oil prices. History will wonder at the mass mental illness of our times.
3432 2018-11-22 18:26:54 Trumputin tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to “a big Tax Cut for America & the World”. Fact: Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. He’s an ignorant buffoon. @MMFlint @VP
3433 2018-11-22 18:26:50 Well yes, I mean by almost definition they are. The difference being that with an air fryer you can actually fry with oil whereas a convection oven is only that - an oven. Air fryers are also smaller so more suitable for every day kitchen counter use.
3434 2018-11-22 18:26:47 We have sunk to a new low! This administration is complicit in this murder.
Money and oil rule. No moral fiber in dump or most Republicans.
3435 2018-11-22 18:26:37 Trump is just like Saudi because they don't care about lives. This is what Trump is saying: The killing of Jamal is okay because United States can get cheap oil. Trump needs to resign as President because He is a dangerous.
3436 2018-11-22 18:26:31 Is it wax or non-wax congestion? If it's wax, try a few drops of warm olive oil. Non-wax, warm water.
3437 2018-11-22 18:26:30 うちの近くにいっぱい送迎バス泊まってるからどれかに！でもマスク苦手なんですヨ。閉所恐怖症の一種でもあるのかな。
3438 2018-11-22 18:26:26 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
3439 2018-11-22 18:26:15 “Thank you Saudi Arabia!  That’s all we need is cheaper oil!  All the worlds problems have been solved! ... oh wait, didn’t they just kill a US citizen with zero recourse... who cares!  Cheaper oil! You’re welcome world!”
3440 2018-11-22 18:26:11 But you don’t seem to care about Canada your biggest trading partner and largest supplier of oil, but what can we expect from someone who can’t comprehend facts....
3441 2018-11-22 18:26:11 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
3442 2018-11-22 18:26:06 Oh, man, that was fun! Finding a place to dispose of all that oil was less fun. Hope you are having a great day, Les! XO
3443 2018-11-22 18:25:46 Sir because of that uncalculated subsidies of UPA1 & UPA2 we are paying almost 9% interest to the oil companies an huge amount of 2lakh crores which is given as bonds since they were not able to pay and from where the govt will pay naturally price hike and cause is @INCIndia
3444 2018-11-22 18:25:44 I almost forgot forgot @MitchGreyson said he needed to oil his hip on the dance floor 
3445 2018-11-22 18:25:40 Trumputin tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to “a big Tax Cut for America & the World”. Fact: Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. He’s an ignorant buffoon. @ABC @NBCNews
3446 2018-11-22 18:25:37 Muammar Ghaddafi & Thanksgiving.  A college friend had lived in Libya when her dad worked for an oil company.  Ghaddafi was a Thanksgiving guest and he even brought the turkey.  He loved the holiday.  True story!
3447 2018-11-22 18:25:36 This guy just feels like a snake oil salesman
3448 2018-11-22 18:25:33 We do not owe thanks to SaudiArabia for oil prices. It supplies 9% of our imported oil. Canada supplies 40%. Lets all give thanks to our neighbor, Canada, which provides a secure source of oil and doesn’t savagely murder journalists and dissidents.
3449 2018-11-22 18:25:29 Then sit back and enjoy the theatre, those gas and oil pipelines won’t liberate themselves.
3450 2018-11-22 18:25:28 today is the reason why i need an oil pen
3451 2018-11-22 18:25:26 I agree. Honestly no CPG product is anywhere comparable or has nearly the Long Tail of wine. My main point is that even the seemingly simplest products (olive oil) have incredible complexity and variation & can create a life’s journey for a passionate consumer 2 become an expert.
3452 2018-11-22 18:25:25 Oil much thicker than blood
3453 2018-11-22 18:25:19 That's when you know it's high quality oil.
3454 2018-11-22 18:25:18 What does oil have to do with taking care of people.
Understanding that the EPN government neglected one, is not one or the other.
Investment is a good thing, not every thing.
Until the world changes it's economy, one country the size of Mexico won't make them change it
3455 2018-11-22 18:25:18 Saving western civilization = blessing Middle East murderers (then thanking them for oil prices which for any commodity trader would laugh at)
3456 2018-11-22 18:25:14 No JAMAICAN black castor oil lol dont just get the regular one
3457 2018-11-22 18:25:09 Spag bol with garlic bread/crusty bread balsamic vinegar and oil .... it’s officially Christmas because I’m a fat mess and I’m happy about it 
3458 2018-11-22 18:25:07 Trump’s “failings”: conspiracy, obstruction of justice, cutting back regulations on chemicals( that will kill us), allowing coal ash to be dumped in rivers, gutting regulations to big oil, violating the emoluments clause in the Constitution, racking up a trillion $ deficit,etc
3459 2018-11-22 18:24:58 I'm extremely confused. I've seen plenty of studies on Mediterranean diet that consider the intake of meat and dairy as indicators of low adherence to this diet. High adherence with intake of oil, legumes, vegetables and fruits.
3460 2018-11-22 18:24:55 It’s about time someone came up with the idea of sending upgraded oil in pipelines . Should have been doing this from day one.
3461 2018-11-22 18:24:44 I still remember the time 15 Saudi's hijacked our planes and killed 3,000 Americans. They have never been our friend. We no longer need their oil. Time to cut them loose.
3462 2018-11-22 18:24:38 The Sinclair Oil dinosaur float scares me.
3463 2018-11-22 18:24:36 Oga was there any proper records of sales of oil by @NNPCgroup? Where there properly recorded revenue  by the NNPC to the appropriate offices?
 140$/BB was only for paperwork. Let's go back to the books.
3464 2018-11-22 18:24:35 The oil companies have raised gas prices steadily since 45 took over the WH - no matter what the actual oil prices were. The US should’ve stopped treating Saudi as a favorite ally long ago and especially so now. Our gutted State Dept has no way to work this either.
3465 2018-11-22 18:24:31 The US has pushed OPEC in both directions depending on their need. Two years ago when oil prices were low the USA was pressuring OPEC and other countries to reduce supply and increase price. this is because north American oil production was expensive, and they were losing out
3466 2018-11-22 18:24:30 Now, if we can at least stop giving subsidies to the oil, gas , and coal that would be a start. I'm afraid if we don't make a rapid transition to renewables, earth and living thing is doomed. All for money and what it can buy. Remember the names of those who did this.
3467 2018-11-22 18:24:14 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?
3468 2018-11-22 18:24:13 Oil will win the Pacific.  Oil Flames 1 and 2.  Meet in second round.  Even better than first. Hitch’s whole life geared towards leading BOA charge for his hometown.
3469 2018-11-22 18:24:00 Oil and gas powers so much of our lives and, yes, that includes #Thanksgiving!
3470 2018-11-22 18:23:57 Ugh. Everything that will keep beyond next March. Tins, dried pasta, pesto, oil. Everything. In case it all goes tits up and I've got hungry kids. I hate it.
3471 2018-11-22 18:23:47 G.O.D. Gold, Oil and Drugs
3472 2018-11-22 18:23:45 Pake oil paper. Beres. :)
3473 2018-11-22 18:23:41 oil be having a bitch eating shit ion normally eat
3474 2018-11-22 18:23:37 Surplus producing countries like the gulf states have become innovative in their efforts to diversify their economies.  Moving away from oil dependent economies.
3475 2018-11-22 18:23:32 It's a mean and nasty world right here in the United States because of you and your followers Donald "Jim Jones" Trump. Saudi Arabia only supplies 11% of U.S. oil. We get more oil from Canada! @JustinTrudeau doesn't have journalists "interviewed" with bone saws! #KhashoggiMurder
3476 2018-11-22 18:23:30 President Trump's last 24 hours reminds US of his key attributes (1) Corruption (literal blood for oil and hotel reservations) (2) Stupidity/incompetence (confusing weather and climate) (3) Cruelty (harm and humiliation towards immigrants) (4) Anti-democracy (fight w/ Roberts).
3477 2018-11-22 18:23:29 Proofing the hood shouldn't be more than a two cuppa job?   Then, go out and get yourself a nice oil filled radiator - with Elly out, shut yourself in the garage with heater and tidy it, then you have a nice tidy warm garage to work on the Fox over winter
3478 2018-11-22 18:23:28 Oil is made from dinosaurs. It’s like pil’s origin story.
3479 2018-11-22 18:23:23 Yeah and it was around $44 as he was taking office. Not to mention lower oil prices in other countries hurts the US's oil jobs.
3480 2018-11-22 18:23:20 Do you see the olive oil? 
3481 2018-11-22 18:23:09 Back in school I thought boiled yam and palm oil was my favorite food I never knew it was poverty that was choosing favorite food for me
3482 2018-11-22 18:23:04 i need some oil
3483 2018-11-22 18:22:58 Butter under the skin. Olive oil on top. Salt
 Blast at 500 for 20 mins. Drop to 325. After and hour add more oil, pepper, dried herbs.
3484 2018-11-22 18:22:49 No comments? While the east coast is in the middle of the biggest oil spill ever... You don't really care about the environment .. The carbon tax promotion is all you care about
3485 2018-11-22 18:22:38 But...cattle ranches take up more space than palm oil plantations- I don’t eat anything with palm oil, but I won’t shop at Iceland if their meat comes from cleared rainforest. I’m awaiting their reply.
3486 2018-11-22 18:22:38 You did squat to get gas down. To much oil on the market. That will change when opec stops production
3487 2018-11-22 18:22:34 The problem is that oil keeps on falling. Hard to keep on being long here. Even though at some point this reduction in exports will work and WTI will go back to at least near 60.
3488 2018-11-22 18:22:33 Sering cuci muka. Sebelum tidur coba maskeran. Trus bawa tisu/oil paper kemana2
3489 2018-11-22 18:22:26 This year alone we have made an extra 1.4 billion in oil. So while I’m sure you can find some bull on the internet to refute pretty much anything you want, my household income has gone up by 1.5 this year and my gf just got a 2 dollar raise. Not to mention we’re paying less taxes
3490 2018-11-22 18:22:20 They like to rub it in! Oil Tycoon monsters!!!! #HappyThanksgiving2018
3491 2018-11-22 18:22:20 have you tried putting tea tree oil on it?
3492 2018-11-22 18:22:02 I'm not a trump supporter, but need to clear out a few things for you. A. the oil market price is determined by supply of oil, which is determined by the major players, such as OPEC, north America, Iran, Russia etc. B. Saudi Arabia sell oil as a leader the OPEC cartel.
3493 2018-11-22 18:21:54 mw/mc, (cuci muka), snail essence, sleeping mask, face oil
3494 2018-11-22 18:21:51 Boo Sinclair oil. Yea baby dinos #macysthanksgivingdayparade
3495 2018-11-22 18:21:51 Apply a small amount of olive oil on the acne scars and it will moisturize and heal the skin along with softening it.
3496 2018-11-22 18:21:50 I can see not using butter- some people have dairy issues. But
 Olive oil. For sweets. 
Noooo
3497 2018-11-22 18:21:39 You r kidding right? This is his announcement in Calgary, the heart of OIL&GAS? OMG we r so screwed.
3498 2018-11-22 18:21:37 Today I am #thankful for amoebas and all other single-celled organisms
3499 2018-11-22 18:21:23 @AldiUK has sustainable palm oil in own brand food only, they suggest calling other brands in store to find out if they are sustainable-they don't know. @RSPOtweets why are they on the committee when they don't know what suppliers do? They should be taken off! #PalmOilAlarmCall
3500 2018-11-22 18:21:23 Y’all we are frying a turkey and I got to put it in and oil flew everywhere 
3501 2018-11-22 18:21:21 Kinda weird that an oil company’s float is featuring newborn baby dinosaurs, no? #MacysDayParade
3502 2018-11-22 18:21:18 Misleading. Doesn’t matter if more oil comes from Canada, Saudis can still drive down the price for everyone.
3503 2018-11-22 18:21:16 Olive oil, I used butter for years, olive oil is better! Just salt and pepper!
3504 2018-11-22 18:21:14 オリーブ油で毎日を楽しく(*^_^*)
3505 2018-11-22 18:21:09 They aren’t what is lowering oil prices...
3506 2018-11-22 18:21:07 The Americans ‘found’ WMDs in Iraq because of its oil. Now Trump ‘finds’ the dude innocent, again for SA’s oil.
3507 2018-11-22 18:21:05 Actually, he values the sale of weapons to the Saudi’s and the bombings of innocent civilians in Yemen over justice. Oil is just a plus for him.
3508 2018-11-22 18:20:54 Stop travelling on anything that uses oil or its by products to show that you have issues with oil money. You are the problem
3509 2018-11-22 18:20:53 I just can't see that "reducing" crude oil in the market by only 1mbd instead of 2mbd is reason for a sell-off. Investors (&people in general) have become so short-sighted in the last decade. Modern investors are the reason oil market makes such extreme moves of recent. imo.
3510 2018-11-22 18:20:52 I use almond oil for the face. Nivea Nourishing (with almond oil) for the body. Safeguard Lemon soap. Homemade sugar scrub for body and face (once a week).
3511 2018-11-22 18:20:45 Top shelf oil & some TLC.
3512 2018-11-22 18:20:43 We are selling oil to our best ally, but Canada needs to wake up, buying oil most stupidest thing going especially from the Saudis.
3513 2018-11-22 18:20:41 Lol no i dont, I just research a lot but Jamaican black castor oil
3514 2018-11-22 18:20:40 How low can you go and take our country to the lowest level ever?   Your acts are despicable.... Now you openly accep and allow murder and disappearance of journalist at Saudi Consulate in Turkey by MBS.  Humans are governed by rule of law not by the low oil price.... moron...
3515 2018-11-22 18:20:38 What deal did you make with the Saudis to drive down the price of oil? It didn't have anything to do with a certain American journalist who was hacked to pieces on the orders of MSB did it?
3516 2018-11-22 18:20:26 كفاية تسريبات الله يرحم والديك 
3517 2018-11-22 18:20:25 It is mean and nasty right here in the USA. How many mass shootings? How many of us will you sell for "Billion's of Dollars" for the war machine in SA? If you can make them lower oil prices, you can make them feed the starving in Yemen. #Fascistidiot #FKQ
3518 2018-11-22 18:20:23 Defending our country's border is a prime directive, other countries not.
Do your job and disincentivise illegal immigration and phoney asylum seeking and they won't have to be there.
3519 2018-11-22 18:20:22 Thats what the oil lobby has been trying to tell us.  The fact is, what u said simply isnt true.  And as usual, u wont be backing up ur statements.
3520 2018-11-22 18:20:20 I totally agree we need to destroy the oil industry. But I’m just curious- how do we determine CO2 levels from 10,000 years ago?
3521 2018-11-22 18:20:16 Some girl scout cookie oil and CannaMontana and purple train for flower. How about you?
3522 2018-11-22 18:20:10 Oil companies know they can gouge us with Trump in office, corrupt bastards one and all.
3523 2018-11-22 18:20:06 Where do you get this type of oil?
3524 2018-11-22 18:20:03 1. Garnier micellar water biru (1x pemakaian)
2. Garnier cleansing oil (2× pemakaian)
1 dan 2= 50k aja. Beli di alpha
3. Skin aqua, tinggal dikit. Gwa jual 5k kali ya atau gratis(?)
4. Mazarizo mask 500gr (50rb) new

3525 2018-11-22 18:20:02 Trumputin tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to “a big Tax Cut for America & the World”. In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia. He’s an ignorant buffoon. @CNN @CBS
3526 2018-11-22 18:20:01 Busy swimming while we are paying her 1/4 million $ a year.... Why is Catherine McKenna so silent about the biggest oil spill in history happening on the east coast? Maybe she likes lobster in crude oil and garlic?  Minister of environment ???  Maybe it's a biking day....
3527 2018-11-22 18:20:00 But, low oil prices & arms purchases would make up for all the death & destruction in trump’s opinion.
3528 2018-11-22 18:19:57 Have you not understood the mindset of @gmbutts & many others surrounding @JustinTrudeau They want to b the world's DARLING for saving the earth of climate change. Hence, our oil industry needs to shut down in order for Justin to be such a goody goody boy internationally speaking
3529 2018-11-22 18:19:49 surely it’s all down to the price of the product. Whatever the product is. Ethically sourced usually commands a high price which the majority can not afford to pay.Iceland are making people aware of the problems caused by deforestation for Palm Oil.

3533 2018-11-22 18:19:25 What’s the impact to oil? Bullish because of sanction?
3534 2018-11-22 18:19:19 Why does Fox Business moan about cheap oil? Cheap oil is good for everyone.
3535 2018-11-22 18:19:15 Loved everything about him.... he'd fight in a heartbeat!! Very giving but with Ewing Oil got the job done....
3536 2018-11-22 18:19:10 I'm confused.  Terrorists, mostly Saudis, killed close to 3,000 Americans on 9/11.  We kept buying their fucking oil, doing business with them as usual, ever since.  Why does it surprise anyone that their killing an American journalist will also be largely ignored?
3537 2018-11-22 18:19:04 Funny , all I saw in  my local paper him thanking Saudi for lowering oil prices. NO SHOCK HE CARES ABOUT OBJECTS , THINGS MORE THAN PEOPLE . prick!
3538 2018-11-22 18:19:01 RETWEET if you’re thankful for oil and natural gas! #Thanksgiving
3539 2018-11-22 18:18:57 No OIL, No LIFE!!!
3540 2018-11-22 18:18:57 That and Oklahoma has got to diversify it's economy. We're so heavily P&G all it takes is for a major Oil and Gas glut and heavy decrease in prices and we're in a recession.
3541 2018-11-22 18:18:54 Let's be clear. He's not doing it for oil. He couldn't give a shit less what oil prices are. He's never had an altruistic thought in his life. This is protecting HIS future interests in the region and nothing more.
3542 2018-11-22 18:18:51 Oh, already done. We ended up just putting rosemary on the skin (whoops) and drenching in olive oil.
3543 2018-11-22 18:18:46 Oh gee we are going to get killed in the spring election if we don’t pretend we are pro oil..... Too late
3544 2018-11-22 18:18:42 An American resident was murdered, and Trump thanks the people that did it for not raising oil prices. This is a dangerous situation for all American journalists who travel abroad.
3545 2018-11-22 18:18:16 He is not doing it for oil and arms. It is a fake excuse! He is doing it to keep his personal business relationship with the Saudis.
3546 2018-11-22 18:18:09 Change oil really ewwww

3548 2018-11-22 18:17:57 Thats what the oil lobby wants  to think.  When government lets u pay a lower tax rate compared to ur peers, thats a subsidy.  Exxon gets its own tax code which is significantly lower than industry standards. The Treasury misses out on that money. They are effectively subsidized.
3549 2018-11-22 18:17:43 Maybe if I drown myself in lavender oil I’ll chill out :)
3550 2018-11-22 18:17:31 And oil is low per barrel! I remain 2008-9 oil was closing in on 150 a barrel andipaid 4.08 a gallon. It’s 60 or so and I pay 3.89?!
3551 2018-11-22 18:17:27 Right after the 25 years Abadan Oil contract which were signed in 1954 + 25 = 1979 Iran Revolution because the Puppet wanted a better oil contract like The Wahabi Zionist Slaves. Guess what happened. We’ll go and research 
3552 2018-11-22 18:17:20 Oil prices have been low it is no thanks to you or Saudia Arabia. You luckily inherited a great economy. If we were in the same place when Obama took office you would make it worse with your policy. You have given us 50% more deficit in two years. You are blind to whats in front
3553 2018-11-22 18:17:11 somebody needs to rub some oil in there 
3554 2018-11-22 18:17:06 Now we know what a journalists life is worth; in the pricing of oil. Is someone writing this down for future reference?
3555 2018-11-22 18:17:03 Okay so if I remember my vast & extensive cooking-show culinary education: keep that oil right around 355-360f, meaning bubbling a bit on its own. Putting food in cools things down, so not too much at once & let it heat back up between batches!

3565 2018-11-22 18:15:39 That is a false equivalence as you are talking about something objectively verifiable regardless of motive. If someone said climate change is a hoax the fact they were funded by an oil company would undermine the objectivity of any claim made by them. It is all about context.

3569 2018-11-22 18:15:32 Lol! Someone got an idea how to make loads of money hahaha, tell ya, if you find the right audience, you can sell any oil. And they even made a shell to protect themselves. These specific crooks are smart. Not that it’s a positive characteristic but it’s something to be noticed.
3570 2018-11-22 18:15:31 Trudeau, or any government in Canada, doesn’t buy oil. Shell, Esso, etc, buy oil from the cheapest supplier they can.  We have very little capacity to refine ALberta bitumen so we ship and import it back from foreign countries.
3571 2018-11-22 18:15:22 Hi Sandra
Where did you buy the Marula oil for how much or do you have a pic.
3572 2018-11-22 18:15:19 its going to be weird one day when we find out the trump family are all robots and that explains why Donald didn't visit the army because he didn't have enough oil to go out in rain
3573 2018-11-22 18:15:18 People do not want to be "educated" about the tech enabling your product. Like you don't want to be educated about the polyalphaolefins in your synthetic motor oil. 
Instead, tell them of the frustration you're removing and work from there.
3574 2018-11-22 18:15:18 We need a refinery first. One that can refine oilsands oil so we can afford all those things YOU want.
3575 2018-11-22 18:15:17 Africa has many of world raw resources oil, diamonds and rare metals. Rare metals used in smartphones, computers, military guiding systems.
3576 2018-11-22 18:15:06 It's Iceland who are guilty of black & white thinking here, as a blanket boycott of palm oil could lead to much more species extinction - oil palm is a very efficient crop. They've also replaced it in many of their products with butter/lard which causes far more animal suffering.
3577 2018-11-22 18:15:06 But his oil!!
3578 2018-11-22 18:14:59 That’s what I’m saying! (I use olive oil, though.)

3585 2018-11-22 18:14:35 It is maybe because there no significant change in oil prices in country compare the drop of Dollar and oil prices globally. So maybe its a balanced act by them who earlier criticised Modi.

3608 2018-11-22 18:12:14 I think the bigger story is that you & Saudi Arabia worked a deal. One dead journalist = lower oil prices.
3609 2018-11-22 18:12:14 Happy Thanksgiving America! Your president bashes the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court for not understanding the Constitution, and says murdering and dismembering an American resident is sad, but OK if it keeps oil prices low. Thankful for what we used to stand for!
3610 2018-11-22 18:12:01 Its main ingredient is hydroxycitric acid, which can and does show major side effects; none of them good. This ad implies that you can have a hard body just by taking a pill a day. It’s snake oil. A change in diet and regular exercise is better and cheaper.
3611 2018-11-22 18:11:50 1. saudi does not set the oil price
2. saudi accounts for only 11% of us imports
3. america does not need saudi, but saudi needs america

5. trump & kushner need the money

they need to go to jail

3634 2018-11-22 18:09:32 You are complicit in the murder of an innocent man. Beating and dismemberment. Why are you talking about gas prices? The Saudis provide 9% of our oil. The Canadians, who you seem to despise, provide 40%. You are an embarrassment. #TrumpLiesMatter #TrumpCrimeFamily
3635 2018-11-22 18:09:26 Alberta never understood they need a refinery for oilsands oil, which is the ONLY oil Alberta owns.
3636 2018-11-22 18:09:24 The only thing that resembles info like this is distilling hydrocarbon. But in terms of oil reserves we are most definitely drying up
3637 2018-11-22 18:09:18 Remember, this is the party of “alternative facts”. Btw Oklahoma, wait until the oil industry starts laying off workers by the thousands because of “Trump’s” low oil prices.

3639 2018-11-22 18:09:11 You are morally bankrupt and a horrible human. Americans want justice for Kashoggi. We haven't sold our souls for oil and a dollar like you have. You can't take that with you when you die. One way or another, you will face the consequences of your actions. DO WHAT IS RIGHT. Ask.
3640 2018-11-22 18:09:05 Isn't 95% their economy based on oil? So obviously not
3641 2018-11-22 18:09:04 Is this a serious tweet about how markets determine the price of oil? Seriously?
3642 2018-11-22 18:08:55 Actually, Alberta Clipper reaches the Gulf Coast using Seaway Flanagan full path and can export Cdn oil from Port Arthur Texas.  Anchor Loop expanded capacity to Burnaby. Tidewater.
3643 2018-11-22 18:08:54 Dude, you’re not the reason gas prices are dropping. What you’re creating is uncertainty. You do realize that we are now the largest producer of oil in the world and don’t need the Saudis or anyone else.

3648 2018-11-22 18:08:45 Is no one aware that oil prices go down globally when countries over produce. That's not that hard to understand. Granted we're probably doing this to hurt Iran. At least try to understand why you're mad

3664 2018-11-22 18:07:02 Do you know that if government find diamonds, oil, Bauxite and Gold behind your backyard it belongs to government but if they find WEE, COCAINE etc at the same place, it belongs to you and you can go jail ??
3665 2018-11-22 18:06:58 What made you decide to roast them in butter instead of Olive oil?
3666 2018-11-22 18:06:57 Got it.  Blood for oil.  Spoken like a true Mafia boss.
3667 2018-11-22 18:06:57 He wants oil at $150 barrel so the Green Energy Gang will gather some traction again.
3668 2018-11-22 18:06:52 Let's remember Thanksgiving tradition--last year a 200,000 gal oil spill on a South Dakota reservation, year before that Natives trying to prevent it were being tortured with dogs,  illegal scare tactics,being run over by angry white ppl all to protect our water. --@lilnativeboy
3669 2018-11-22 18:06:42 They need it in Calgary because of the mess the Liberals have done with our oil sector. We are the laughing stock of the world.
3670 2018-11-22 18:06:39 The bigger picture is China just signed on to be the largest importer of oil from SA.  They will prob use Yuan.  This is getting towards the end of the road for the petro $ the USA may not be happy with MBS buying s400 and now yuan for oil.  Its good for the rest of the world.
3671 2018-11-22 18:06:38 Depends on how burned out Oil are on Cam letdowns.  Does clearing out from room remove a cloud?  Has Hitch seen anything in Cams gm or head fixable.
3672 2018-11-22 18:06:29 Add a bit of fresh garlic to just about everything. (try roasting some of it and storing it in olive oil for use).  Thumbs up on the Duke's Mayonnaise.  But, why do you need to cover the dressing ------ y'all got roaches?
3673 2018-11-22 18:06:24 Because of lower gas prices And barrels of oil going down. Layoffs are coming for 400,000 oil workers.
3674 2018-11-22 18:06:17 Masha Allah
3675 2018-11-22 18:06:16 Am I the only one who hates lotion? I prefer oil any day.
3676 2018-11-22 18:06:05 It's the "Oil for arms" that took place under the  GEJ administration I'm still waiting to be made public. That one is far scandalous and those arms are still in the country.
3677 2018-11-22 18:06:05 You do realize that when oil prices decline, the price at the pump doesn't immediately go down right? The stations will reflect the new price once they purchase new fuel at the lower prices.
3678 2018-11-22 18:06:03 I get it your completely responsible for the low oil prices. Since your Boyfriend has his finger on the price of oil make him lower it back to the price we paid back in the early 00
3679 2018-11-22 18:05:57 My mum has banned Cadburys chocolate from the house because they use parm oil and get it from bad sources
3680 2018-11-22 18:05:56 Yet that's not the reason gas prices are lower.  The MOFO lies.  We get 9% of our oil from Saudis and 40% from Canada.
3681 2018-11-22 18:05:54 Gas is about to go up now! Fuccccck! $oil $cl
3682 2018-11-22 18:05:53 Actually .... Alberta Clipper reaches the Gulf Coast through the full path system with Seaway and Flanagan, with some exports of Cdn oil out of Port Arthur, Texas. Anchor Loop expands capacity to Burnaby. Line 9 could reach tidewater in Quebec.  All capable of reaching coast
3683 2018-11-22 18:05:49 Yeah...no one likes having poison anywhere near them, much less under their skin...except the already blind, deaf, ignorant Trump supporters....They mainline it into their bodies. Most oil is from US, not the Saudis. Try to pay attention to reality.
3684 2018-11-22 18:05:43 Sorry - forest clearance for palm oil and forest clearance (actually on a larger scale) for cattle ranching - there’s no difference here.
3685 2018-11-22 18:05:42 I have an ology O-Level
I’m a scientist,it’s snake oil 
3686 2018-11-22 18:05:40 40% of imported oil into the #USA is from #Canada. Less than 15% comes from #SaudiArabia.
3687 2018-11-22 18:05:36 أمر
3688 2018-11-22 18:05:34 So you're cool with them killing, decapitating Khashoggi & dismembering him? As long as you can access their oil and sell arms to the Nation that brought us 9/11.  Disgraceful
3689 2018-11-22 18:05:30 I was part of a Goldwater-loving, conspiracy-believing Republican family back at the dawn of time.   Voted Repub for 25 more years, saw the light after 10 years of PAC FEC filings for a Fortune 50 multi-national oil company.  Been a Democrat now longer than I was a Repub.
3690 2018-11-22 18:05:27 We're a oil and gas state bro. Oklahoma is #1 or 2 in Natural Gas production and #3 in Oil production. All the Oil in North America comes to Oklahoma too. Transport is plentiful here and we have 5 refineries within or within a stones throw of Tulsa. Gasoline is always cheap here.
3691 2018-11-22 18:05:26 What do you or Mr. Kenney or anyone else propose? $4 billion has already been invested directly in that pipeline. Do you suggest the government simply give the oil companies money?
3692 2018-11-22 18:05:26 Thank thank you President Trump we were suckers we rebuilt Europe. No more. No more should have kept oil wells Our military freed Kuwait. America 1st about time build the wall. Protect Americans .we live President Trump Americas President Happy Thankgiving.

3697 2018-11-22 18:05:02 Wait what....as Hilary gives two shits about native Americans, let alone a pipeline being build. She took about 90% PAC money. You can bet some of that money was from the oil industry. So please, spare me the bullshit

3700 2018-11-22 18:04:37 Admit that even rebating retroactively to Drillers is too little, too late. Won't convince producers to suddenly start drilling in pursuit of locked in under $15/barrel oil!

BTW, your advice to @abndpcaucus in May 2015 said AB would be a NET importer of NatGas in a few yrs! Fail
3701 2018-11-22 18:04:31 Money, jobs and oil are not more important than ethics and morals
3702 2018-11-22 18:04:31 Because it's Trump first, America last.  His bowing to MBS has nothing to do with oil and nothing to do with arms deals. He wants to keep raking in the Saudi millions, so murder of a journalist is just fine so long as Saudis' checks doesn't bounce at trump hotels.
3703 2018-11-22 18:04:29 Are you factoring in inflation rate? Hapana zvaaita aha. Last year you used to buy 2l cooking oil at $3.20 now you are buying it at $6 or 7. Pafunge
3704 2018-11-22 18:04:29 Id like to see all journalists submit to an ideology test before they receive a DAMN nickel from Trudeau

1 do they actively protest oil
2 do they believe in white privilege
3 do they have any problems with open boarders.
4 do they like the carbon tax
Answer no-YOU FAIL! #Cdnpoli
3705 2018-11-22 18:04:21 Ok... But Cadillac, Range Rover, Jag are some of the worst in quality.  Always in shops. BMW and Mercedes love charging $200 for an oil change. God help you when you need brakes are other mod mileage maintenance. Just sayin’. 
3706 2018-11-22 18:04:13 #Oil spills are just one manifestation of the general problem with #petroleum products being that the burning and producing of petroleum causes long term #environmental harms. Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (#LENR)
3707 2018-11-22 18:04:08 The shift to dependency on Saudi oil was only a tactic to compromise US energy infrastructure and independence/strength. Oil price determines price of EVERYTHING because its involved in all production and transportation and communication. They needed to control oil price.
3708 2018-11-22 18:04:01 There are measures for writing off investment in equipment, 100% in the year they're made. Oil and gas are equipment intensive industries. They're also industries that invest tons of money in environmental equipment.

3712 2018-11-22 18:03:29 A tweet  on Twitter this morning that oil are at $58 ,our news it's $68
3713 2018-11-22 18:03:28 Sources? It seems Bush2, in fact, the entire Bush fam was *in bed* with oil prod. The 1st Gulf War was under, & long into the Bush1 admin.  Obama "inherited" the war on Afghanistan,  Bush2 called for US troops to "tiptoe" into, & around Baghdad looking for WMD that didn't exist.
3714 2018-11-22 18:03:28 Whe you go out to fry your turkey and realize there’s a hole in the pot and then you lose half the oil pouring it out and people will be here in an hour to eat...
3715 2018-11-22 18:03:22 Thanks to the Center for Science in the Public Interest for taking away the beef tallow (and coconut oil in movie popcorn) to give the public ‘healthy’ (NOT) industrial, non-food seed oils instead.
3716 2018-11-22 18:03:18 Make sure that the internal temperature is 160 degrees before taking it out of the hot oil.
3717 2018-11-22 18:03:14 the keyword is the OIL price..no chance for justice
3718 2018-11-22 18:03:10 Heard of oil pulling? The latest craze in oral care, which involves swishing coconut oil in your mouth, has many proponents. However, the ADA notes that there have been no scientific studies to prove its benefits. Consult a dentist for all your dental hygiene questions. #dentist

3720 2018-11-22 18:02:38 Check your engine oil at least once a month, but preferably more frequently. If you vehicle is losing or burning oil, you’ll want to know as soon as possible so you can correct the issue.
3721 2018-11-22 18:02:38 it’s not for the flavor lol mayo is mostly oil so it’s an alternative to butter
3722 2018-11-22 18:02:14 What’s an oil change??   usually every 5000. Guy at dealership said 10,000 was fine. I don’t think he realized how much city driving I do.
3723 2018-11-22 18:02:00 The olive oil
3724 2018-11-22 18:01:58 Our oil is now sitting at $14.00 a barrel.  I've been trying to sell my home for 3 years.  I hold JT responsible. Ur rite. Sick meet blow.

Spanish omelette: Eggs, potatoes, onion, olive oil.
3726 2018-11-22 18:01:54 Apparently that hasn’t been a concern as those are decades old problems. However! Bailing out Texas Oil company shareholders for $4.5B ($1.2B of which was profit) who made a poor investment in a pipeline is VITAL. #cdnpoli oh and raises for the govt...2 since they came into power
3727 2018-11-22 18:01:54 In the darkness, I am thankful for YOU. Yes, you there in cyberspace. We share the same view that there’s still goodness in the world. We see that humans are better than guns, oil, and money. Keep your chin up and continue to uplift those around you. #Resist #Vets #TruBluLou
3728 2018-11-22 18:01:53 wrong. 

there are neither huge amounts of oil left and no major fields are announced every other week. 

any article you might show now will not be for a large discovery.

do you know what Peak Production means?  

if you do then you will know that we are well past PP
3729 2018-11-22 18:01:49 My sister thinks i am coming to waka about with her. Me that just want to be rubbing my glow oil and sleep inside AC. 
3730 2018-11-22 18:01:45 Well, actually it isn't drying up fast. Quite the opposite in fact. You can oppose oil if you want but not on that basis.
3731 2018-11-22 18:01:38 2011-2014 BMW 3 series even better price, kbb shows $9500ish in my area. Just change the frikkin oil and use Mann filters and synthetic oil. Do it yourself, those $8/hour guys crush the filters cuz they dont put the element in all the way.
3732 2018-11-22 18:01:35 If you acknowledged that the US gets the majority of it's oil from the USA, then Canada, then the Saudis (only 7%), then you might get it. Also, if oil drops below $50, American jobs in oil start to be in jeopardy, people "might" pay attention. But you're always wrong so...
3733 2018-11-22 18:01:27 Bullshit!

They are mean and nasty because presidents through the years have let Saudi Arabia know that oil is more important than our fellow humans.   You're the first to throw a blind eye and scream it from the mountaintop because you don't care about humanity
3734 2018-11-22 18:01:24 Less than .5% additional jobs, we produce more oil than Saudi. These are facts
3735 2018-11-22 18:01:24 WTF are you talking about?  Your complete lack of leadership is about to implode the Alberta oil industry

3752 2018-11-22 18:00:01 To explain the big price move in crude oil, "Tricked" sounds more interesting than "trendline break." Even so -- the real question is, did the market tip its hand before the big move? See the answer for yourself in Chart of the Day.

3759 2018-11-22 17:59:14 We get 11% of our IMPORTED oil from the Saudis, that would mean that the overall percentage of oil we get from them is much less!
3760 2018-11-22 17:59:03 Isn't it? It's wonderful. I'm always knocked out when kids have this kind of skill level. And the video is so cute too! Like the director said, "Okay, just have fun and we'll tape that." 
3761 2018-11-22 17:58:45 Notice how Trump thanks Saudi Arabia... and NOT American oil producers.

3763 2018-11-22 17:58:44 Illegal oil money 
3764 2018-11-22 17:58:38 You’re correct. Trump calling Canada “a National Security Threat” has nothing to do with Canada supplying oil. He just hates us. Oh ... and that PM Trudeau is young, handsome and Ivanka loves him.  
3765 2018-11-22 17:58:37 Aaaaw yis.

Can I oil them up before I start washing the clothes? I hear oiled up abs get stains out better >w>;;;
3766 2018-11-22 17:58:37 Did you know that old oil tanks can actually be a fire hazard? While a steel tank may seem like it’s fire resistant, the old sludge and remnants of heating oil in the bottom is flammable. Getting your tank removed will help to keep you safe.
3767 2018-11-22 17:58:29 Selling out American values for oil.    The 30 pieces of silver for the 21st century.   Surely there are some Republicans in Congress that still believe in American values over their  disgusting president.
3768 2018-11-22 17:58:22 . You delete tweets every 3 months. We see the pattern Ayo. You not slick to a can of oil.
3769 2018-11-22 17:58:22 She and her site are elitist.  If they weren't, they would be selling things that people could afford.  Not that I would want to style myself after an ignorant snake oil salesperson. Who knew it cost so much to look that dumb?
3770 2018-11-22 17:58:19 Great news but why are we still paying over$2.40 a gallon? We need to get the oil companies to have their prices reflect the lower oil prices. Thank you for being our president.
3771 2018-11-22 17:58:10 There are several issues here. The reality is, Saudi has a huge cultural difference than the western world, but we’re ok with using their oil because we cave to eco terrorists
3772 2018-11-22 17:58:04 Is that what CNN told you? Lol. We don't need their oil. And you DON'T pay Trump and it is because of him Gas prices are Low. Is this where "If you only had a brain" comes in?
3773 2018-11-22 17:58:01 While you'd be right in thinking that a brand new car doesn't require as much care as one that's been significantly used, they still do also need attention every now and then. Regular oil changes, in particular, are very important as they can keep your engine running...
3774 2018-11-22 17:57:56 Who are you kidding? Gas prices go according to oil prices and YOU have nothing to do with that. They typically drop this time of year anyway. Do you EVER research before you speak? Ever?!

3778 2018-11-22 17:57:26 Oil and gas companies treat you good, yesterday they wined and dined us at a fancy restaurant... now I’m not sure if i want to leave this industry
3779 2018-11-22 17:57:25 Also, the world is changing. There will be a decrease in demand for oil. The revenues from @OilGasCanada have to be replaced by other sources of income. No political party is interested in this revenue problem other than flog the interests of the industry. What good is this?
3780 2018-11-22 17:57:25 dust mites? in the oil?
3781 2018-11-22 17:57:23 I’m wrong that exodus didn’t start in Q2 2014 but it started in Q2 2014? Please go on. 

Though it doesn’t matter, the amount of people leaving was normal for an oil bust. Your correlation isn’t the causation.
3782 2018-11-22 17:57:23 Kruidvat!Argan Oil of Morocco-Penetrating Oil heet 't & ze hebben ook haar maskers, shampoo/conditioner er van.

3783 2018-11-22 17:57:16 As much as you'd like us to believe that you influence fuel prices...
The current surplus is largely attributed to a miscalculation between demand and output by major producers, including Iran. A strong dollar is also weighing on oil prices.

3786 2018-11-22 17:57:13 Trump is too much of a self-absorbed narcissist to care about America. As less than 10% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia, their pricing on oil has a negligible affect on US oil prices. The CIA has the murder tape & Trump knows the content. No, this policy reeks of graft.
3787 2018-11-22 17:57:10 My secret marinade injected, oil less fried turkey wings are gonna be awesome!
3788 2018-11-22 17:57:09 Been waiting for pipelines to the east coast for over thirty years. Shut down the Saudi oil coming to the east coast. We want made in Canada solutions.
3789 2018-11-22 17:57:00 So you're telling me that big oil is out there kissing Trudeau's ass?
3790 2018-11-22 17:57:00 Calls the middle East mean and nasty. Talks about oil and jobs. No mention of a brutally murdered WP journalist. Even though he has attacked WP multiple times no condolences or sympathies. Not even a worthless thoughts and prayers to the family.
3791 2018-11-22 17:56:59 it is part of the new Globalist government .Who has the oil supplies what is their faith?
3792 2018-11-22 17:56:39 Where is the Scottish Sovereign Fund o of course the English squandered  the oil wealth on a  pocketful of trifles
3793 2018-11-22 17:56:37 i got peppermint oil in my left eye and shampoo in the right
3794 2018-11-22 17:56:35 He overfilled the oil. Loser.
3795 2018-11-22 17:56:30 I would respectfully suggest that they go back to school and retrain. It's what families do when there are no jobs in the original field. I don't think waiting for the oil industry to figure out economics is going to be productive for the unemployed.
3796 2018-11-22 17:56:25 The bigger secret is behind the word "fossil fuels". Biomaterial does NOT turn into hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbons are always being expelled from Earth. It is an infinite resource. There is no wars for oil.
3797 2018-11-22 17:56:23 @realDonaldTrump  so the Saudi's mistake Eric for a person disparaging the monarchy and have him disposed of, is OIL prices still the priority to you? Probably, since money is all that matters in that tiny mentally deficient brain !
3798 2018-11-22 17:55:58 You don’t let people murder with impunity unless there is oil at stake. 
3799 2018-11-22 17:55:40 Make sure you use the best motor oil ever developed. @ClaimYourOilBiz
3800 2018-11-22 17:55:31 Hey, trump did you know oil isn’t infinite? We can’t use it forever...
3801 2018-11-22 17:55:30 Asking some real scary q here, but if oil price saying something about the dissipating cost push inflation then... Fundamental & Technicals aligned
3802 2018-11-22 17:55:27 おんおん
3803 2018-11-22 17:55:26 انت أهون من ان يرد عليك
3804 2018-11-22 17:55:25 Oil Workers are most knowledgeable and conscientious about Responsible extraction of oil.
ENVIROS HAVE NO REAL CLUE ON THE VALUE OF THIS LIFE SAVING AND WORLD SAVING INDUSTRY!!
3805 2018-11-22 17:55:23 This is not about pros and cons, oil prices shouldn’t be in the discussion when it comes Khashoggi
3806 2018-11-22 17:55:18 The #IdiotInChief doesn't understand how an umbrella works, you expect him to understand international oil trading?! He's just. So. DUMB!
3807 2018-11-22 17:55:14 @RahsaanSalaam I would love to hear the "Oil and Vinegar vs. Vinaigrette" saga from Sep 2002. I have not heard is since it originally aired . Thanks! #sternthology
3808 2018-11-22 17:55:13 These Gulf countries are run by deluded leaders with stone age mentality. When there’s no oil anymore, things will change.
3809 2018-11-22 17:55:04 yeah, avocados and olive oil 
3810 2018-11-22 17:55:03 Those kind of guys are the most nicest people u can ever come across in a relationship. They are willing to do anything just to get under a girl's pant.

3814 2018-11-22 17:54:34 Soaked weed in coconut oil last night, so I'm going home to try that chocolate thing Afro Roman numerals tweeted about. If I'm not here tomorrow, it's because I've perished.
3815 2018-11-22 17:54:31 U claimed $3b - $5B in subsidizing oil prodn. I am asking for where you get that number. U also claim no mkt for dillbit and I'd like a source for that too. Why is that difficult? Didn't claim to be an expert, its why I'm asking for the source. Why would KM build TMX if no mkt?
3816 2018-11-22 17:54:31 Thanks for confirming that you short sell American ideals and aspirations for oil and weapons.
@EricFalangas
3817 2018-11-22 17:54:29 I have taken everyone right out of their comfort zone over a simple Dijon mustard/olive oil rub.
3818 2018-11-22 17:54:29 @OfficialPDPNig still borrowed when we had oil boom... What confused party, filled with individuals with very high kleptocratic tendency.
3819 2018-11-22 17:54:26 I mixed this coconut oil, Shea butter and aloe Vera hydrating mask for this dry ass face of mine. I hope it works!!!
3820 2018-11-22 17:54:20 Oh and some moisturizing oil I like rose hemp
3821 2018-11-22 17:54:19 what a stupid question that is!

different production costs
different production volumes
different taxation/ownership

UK north sea oil is well past peak production, it is costly to get the oil out. 
UK still makes more from oil than most other oil producing countries in world
3822 2018-11-22 17:54:16 They could supply local meat instead of importing from cattle ranches which replaced rain forests. I wish people would understand what I’m saying. Forest clearance for palm oil or cattle ranching - there’s no difference!
3823 2018-11-22 17:54:14 Where we are assisting with the genocide of 14 million Yemeni civilians? 

No Iran. You remember a few days ago when your bff & psychopath Mike Pompeo, threaten to starve Iranian civilians?

Country next to Iraq, where we destroyed murdered 1 million citizens for oil.
3824 2018-11-22 17:54:13 A day after giving Saudi Arabia a "Pass" for killing journalist Jamal Khoshoggi, President Trump lauded the kingdom for keeping oil prices down - His statement comes less than 24 hours after the CIA concluded that the Saudi Prince ordered the murder
3825 2018-11-22 17:54:09 Everyone across the globe should show  #ThanksgivingDay2018 as the crude oil price go down recently.
3826 2018-11-22 17:54:08 Que oil

3833 2018-11-22 17:53:54 Hey I know the feeling except I've felt it longer. My mineral interests have gas wells on them... Gas has been down longer than Oil.
3834 2018-11-22 17:53:53 Sabah binlerce doları konuşmaya bağlayıp akşam üstü milyarlarca dolarlık yatırımları irdeleyip gece nakit avans çektiren bir düzen oil&gas.
3835 2018-11-22 17:53:52 why does it amaze you? oil does play into inflation no?
3836 2018-11-22 17:53:52 Can’t vape any flower till later but I got my pen with a cart of SFV OG Kush to hold me over along with a nice splash of CBD oil to stay chill.
3837 2018-11-22 17:53:48 Except that the US gets about 4 of those "caravans" every week, averaging out around 500k a yr.... and the cartels make billions off of a major portion of that trafficking, not including drugs, weapons, or stolen oil.
3838 2018-11-22 17:53:40 Humm that a good question I think it's a toss up dirty mob money from Russia and oil money which he owes lots of loans and real estate dealings with the Saudi. Either way he and the GOP are all compromised! #Traitors
#Followthetrailofdirtymoney
3839 2018-11-22 17:53:39 For sure... I feel you
Soak it in oil and water for 30 minutes before washing... helps with that sand dust
3840 2018-11-22 17:53:38 2 cups each corn, rice, wheat chex. 2 cups pretzels, 3 cups bugles, 2 cups cashews. 

Stick of butter (melted), 3 tbsp popcorn oil, 3
Tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1oz package of dry ranch mix. 

Mix this together in a roasting pan and make sure the dry ingredients are coated well
3841 2018-11-22 17:53:31 Shell and other oil-focused companies need to divert revenue from oil sales in to renewable technology. Don't pay it lip service, have a clear public goal of 'selling oil now but to deliver low carbon options in future'. Public would buy in to this... Be a huge statement....
3842 2018-11-22 17:53:30 More like a share of those oil profits or bribes. Lower oil prices = fears of recession by global manufacturing.  Look at what’s happening to RE prices too.
3843 2018-11-22 17:53:22 I made the mistake of telling my family I haven’t gotten an oil change in 2 years and now I have to listen to this for the next 5 hours
3844 2018-11-22 17:53:17 Probably because of  oil reserves they are making for any emergency.
3845 2018-11-22 17:53:10 هذا خبر؟
أو أمر ؟
3846 2018-11-22 17:53:08 Its great cause you don’t gotta worry about a fryer and used oil n shit
3847 2018-11-22 17:52:59 Bathong I had no idea.. they got a shampoo and a conditioner. Yes it's reasonable. The leavein alone is 80 buck. Oil also 80-100 not sure.
3848 2018-11-22 17:52:48 Not sure if I'd even want him as POHO, I know that Bakersfield and the Oil Kings are doing alright right now, but with him having final say on Trades, that would be my big concern with his track record.
3849 2018-11-22 17:52:45 Oat milkとAlmond butterでも担々麺風が出来てしまったいつかどこかで見た豆乳と練り胡麻で作る担々麺レシピの応用。Turkey minceでアッサリだから中華麺よりは素麺のほうが合うと思う。決め手はすりおろしニンニクとCrispy Chilli Oil。これがないと味がボヤける。香味大事
3850 2018-11-22 17:52:42 Are rec shops open today? I kinda killed 5 grams of oil in 3 days and now i need more 
3851 2018-11-22 17:52:37 You wouldn't know this but "Your Full of Crap"!!! You haven't done anything to get oils prices down. A President cannot adjust the price of oil. The producers of oil Do!!! Your such a child. Stop lying!!!
3852 2018-11-22 17:52:36 It's hard to imagine deeper frying than dropping a turkey into a giant pot of 375 degree oil.
3853 2018-11-22 17:52:33 Are you honestly comparing a war torn country to one that simply has a terrible economic system?
Venezuela isn’t at war and has the most oil reserves on the planet.
It should be massively wealthy.

3857 2018-11-22 17:52:21 Pan Africanism spirit #ObiangGabriel “I’m here in Juba in this Oil & Power conference not just as  minister of Mines & Hydrocarbons of Equatorial Guinea, I’m also here  as an African supporting another African nation. Africans should start working as one team”
3858 2018-11-22 17:52:20 I guess you didn’t bother to even glance at the article.  Follow up studies after oil spills have shown that only a tiny percentage (<1%) of birds “rescued” after an oil spill survive or return to breeding. It’s theatrics to make humans feel better, just like feeding wildlife.
3859 2018-11-22 17:52:19 Dear Cadbury, would you please stop using palm oil
3860 2018-11-22 17:52:18 Norway is an independent country that manages it's own natural resources...like oil. That you making the case for independence?
3861 2018-11-22 17:52:17 But the price of Oil is GREAT!  It appears that when I think he can’t stoop lower.  He does.
3862 2018-11-22 17:52:13 Yes #America take pride that an American resident journalist along with our morals were murdered and chopped into little piece for a few cents less at the pump #BloodMoney #Oil
3863 2018-11-22 17:51:59 Darwin Awards go to the imbeciles who drop FROZEN turkeys into 350°F peanut oil.
3864 2018-11-22 17:51:57 Qatar’s pretty stable, it’s an oil monarchy, the likelihood of a terrorist attack there is probably as likely as a terrorist attack in the UAE
3865 2018-11-22 17:51:57 "The unprecedented palm-oil boom, meanwhile, has enriched and emboldened many of the region’s largest corporations, which have begun using their newfound power and wealth to suppress critics, abuse workers and acquire more land to produce oil."
3866 2018-11-22 17:51:54 I see Shia Iran is funding Hezbollah with Syrian oil money and via Russian and Iranian banks. Yes, apparently hundreds of millions of dollars have been channelled by Iran to terrorists with intent of attacking Israel. USA to impose more sanctions on Persia.
3867 2018-11-22 17:51:50 Yes, these new-fangled digital things are so complicated.  If steam was good enough 200 years ago, it should be good enough for our military today.  Bring back the hot oil catapults too!
3868 2018-11-22 17:51:48 The foolish virgins are found by the master with no oil. Oil usually represents God’s spirit so I suppose this is talking about qualities produced by the spirit. The parable is to encourage us to keep on the watch so that we will not be found naked upon the masters coming.

3870 2018-11-22 17:51:28 Well obviously it’s oil prices!  I mean he just thanked the Saudis for driving prices down!  I mean the 8-10% of our oil we actually get from them obviously did the trick!
3871 2018-11-22 17:51:05 Yeah, but oil 
3872 2018-11-22 17:50:59 I don’t want oil to go lower, my royalty checks sucks as it is now!
3873 2018-11-22 17:50:59 I need a car wash today right now my wheels are black again and they just cleaned them for me. I can’t go get my oil change with them looking like that I just look unappreciative 
3874 2018-11-22 17:50:53 Yes, I wish Dump would move to Canada, there’s just one problem, CANADA wouldn’t have him! Especially since he said Saudi Arabia sold them oil  when its Canada that supplies 40% and they only supply 10 to 11%. Lying again
3875 2018-11-22 17:50:45 The oil price thing is a dodge. It’s about condo prices, and loans, and secrets. And his love of autocrats. USA gets 4X more oil from Canada than from Saud and he disses Canada and its leaders.

3879 2018-11-22 17:50:37 Its simple- The Dutch, Britain & Germany have few natural resources of their own
They can barely feed themselves- thats why they plunder the world
Without the Russians selling oil- for free Germany would be bankrupt
The Mediteranean nations are subsidizing Germany & France #qanon
3880 2018-11-22 17:50:34 Yeah we are going scorched earth on the way out like Sadaam lighting all the oil wells on fire. We suck. I can't wait for you guys to take over
3881 2018-11-22 17:50:29 So make we clap for you naaa.....knowing fully well that there’s atom of truth on what he said......Prof Wole Soyinka mention that an Ex President Obasanjo gave his girl friend an oil block in this country did you send him out of the country ? Man no be God ooooo
3882 2018-11-22 17:50:27 ไม่รักกันแล้วหรอ....
3883 2018-11-22 17:50:26 We buy more oil from Canada than we do from Saudi Arabia...
3884 2018-11-22 17:50:23 Actually it down to about 8% of our oil needs. They are not our allies.
3885 2018-11-22 17:50:18 Then what’s leading to this?! Explain
3886 2018-11-22 17:50:17 How much oil did you buy with blood?  What are you willing to negotiate with next?
3887 2018-11-22 17:50:14 The Saudis need us more than we need them. They are restricting oil productioto raise gas prices They haven't use our weapons in Syria or Iraq but in Yemen.They cannot buy weapons from any other country to mix with US arms

3891 2018-11-22 17:49:59 Saudi prince gave the “ok” for the journalist to be taken out, because he knew President Trump wouldn’t cause a commotion about it. But oil price is down, that’s most important, so what if a reporter gets sacrificed. Right, right...?
3892 2018-11-22 17:49:54 Blood for oil
3893 2018-11-22 17:49:50 It's not about Saudi oil. It's about Middle East stability with regard to our alliance with the Saudi's who keep Iran in check. Tell me, why don't you care when gay people are murdered just for being gay or why you don't care that women are oppressed by their religion?
3894 2018-11-22 17:49:39 وباقي المساجين الذين لم يجد اهاليهم طريق لولي العهد .. ماذا يفعلون .

3895 2018-11-22 17:49:34 So why does @liberal_party @JustinTrudeau have to keep bailing out @OilGasCanada ? All Canadians have pitched in to buy a pipeline. What next? A train system? A trucking company? Isn't this the free market? Why not just decrease oil production? It is getting ridiculous.
3896 2018-11-22 17:49:27 HAHAH Chelsea doesnt have awful fans, bet u say that to every football team. Chelsea are nothing consistent, kicking their manager every second season, russian oil money is only reason u are where u are now. U prob support Abramovich more than the fake ass team
3897 2018-11-22 17:49:24 Syria has many petróleo and oil, and is more much better than money, and a population very younger.... they rebuilt again, and we will see!!!
Great country
3898 2018-11-22 17:49:18 India. China. Korea (both of them). Japan. Malaysia. Thailand. France. Norway. England. Spain.

All of them have refineries capable of using our oil. They were all here until the @abndpcaucus took office.
3899 2018-11-22 17:49:18 A dead man who was tortured is nothing compared to that oil & those jobs, right?

You are a sad, sad man. You have no friends, no one who really loves you, no real family.  You got no love as a child and give none as an adult.  You have psychological issues and need serious help.
3900 2018-11-22 17:49:16 Why did 19th century folks buy snake oil from the snake oil salesman?

Like a traveling salvation preacher, Trump tells the desperate what they want to hear. “We’re reopening the coal mines!” is a pretty attractive promise to a laid-off coal miner.
3901 2018-11-22 17:49:16 Rogers asking about storm damage to oil production offshore. Coady says cnlopb will have resources they require

3903 2018-11-22 17:49:07 Wait till their oil runs out they gonna be coming to us for jobs
3904 2018-11-22 17:49:05 Only now--after three servings of eggs were cooked in three separate batches in one pan without butter, oil, or non-stick spray--do I truly feel like the college kids have arrived home. "Burnt pan" is not on my list of autumn aroma favorites.
3905 2018-11-22 17:49:03 You guys need to make vape carts that don’t have that disgusting tasting MCT in it!! Uncut oil with cannabis derived terps is where it’s at. Plus your prices are too damn high. These two reasons are why I quit buying your products but I’m sure you don’t care 
3906 2018-11-22 17:49:00 "We have no country to fight for. You robbed us of our country and gave it to the sheep. Therefore, since you have preferred sheep to men, let sheep now defend you." Today, I have been teaching John McGrath's The Cheviot, The Stag, and the Black Black Oil
3907 2018-11-22 17:49:00 No alcohol, no free internet, no sexy women... Only sand in your butt, oil and Mercedes
3908 2018-11-22 17:48:59 Canada provides America 4 times more oil than Saudi does. There is zero reason for us to be in bed with them.
3909 2018-11-22 17:48:58 They smarter than u think dear.
3910 2018-11-22 17:48:56 Energy Independence!!  Woohoo!!  No more Saudi or Canadian oil!!

Wait, didn’t he say gas prices dropped because the price of Saudi oil came down?

The economy!!!  S&P500 is negative, year-to-date.

Wait, that list is bullshit!!!
3911 2018-11-22 17:48:48 -Weird… Saudi Arabia only provides 11% US oil while Canada provides 40%.-

But Canada isn’t kissing trump’s ample ass & giving him massive “loans”.

#HappyThankgiving
3912 2018-11-22 17:48:47 Agreed Trump had nothing to do with the murder & his actions were correct - HOWEVER, poor choice of words

 Aside fr oil$, S.Arabia is an ally against Iran whom Obama gave billions to kill Americans

+ he did not need to say, “we stand with S.Arabia nor thank you S.Arabia.”
3913 2018-11-22 17:48:46 Also a lie, because Saudis are not the ones to thank for low oil prices, and oil prices aren't low. Trump is literally fabricating a reason to allow them to get away with murder.
3914 2018-11-22 17:48:45 Saudi provides 9% oil. Canada 40%. Trump, Putin, MBS = Oil
3915 2018-11-22 17:48:45 The US is the world's largest oil producer, I think this is a good thing because it makes Trump wrong about something, instead of bad because it means we are literally all going to die from our self caused apocalypse.

3917 2018-11-22 17:48:42 WE ARE ON TO STATE!!!!! THERE IS NO BIGGER GAME THAN THIS! EVERYONE GET TO LUCAS OIL STADIUM AND GET LOUD FOR OUR SAINTS!!! THE THEME WILL BE WHITE/GOLD OUT OR WEAR YOUR STATE SHIRTS GAME IS @ 3:30!!!!! LETS GET THOSE RINGS
3918 2018-11-22 17:48:42 Point still stands: more people are moving to Alberta than leaving.

New point: the exodus starting in Q2 2014 (not under NDP oddly) wasn’t unprecedented according to the very website you are referencing during an oil bust.
3919 2018-11-22 17:48:42 Matthew, my Turkey is presenting beautifully. Must be the coconut oil.
Happy Thanksgiving Matt to you and yours
3920 2018-11-22 17:48:40 Helping the oil industries help America.  Great Idea.  Thanks you Mr. President.
3921 2018-11-22 17:48:29 Because we need oil so badly....
*cough*
3922 2018-11-22 17:48:28 So when oil prices go up again, can we punish the Saudis?
3923 2018-11-22 17:48:21 It’s a kush and oil vape my friend
Best one on the market handsdown.

3924 2018-11-22 17:48:21 ..like Blair he is a snake oil salesman.
3925 2018-11-22 17:48:20 Gasoline prices the highest in four years

Deficit highest level in 6 years at $779 billion.

Avr. hourly wage growth, 2.7 % over the past year, but, a surge of inflation, driven by higher oil prices, has clawed back almost all those wage gains

And that easy to win trade war...
3926 2018-11-22 17:48:15 Italian olive oil 
3927 2018-11-22 17:48:13 “If only someone would do something”

“Oh well!” *literally chooses a bank that is building oil pipelines on stolen land, and cost of millions of people their homes and lives due to predatory financial tactics*
3928 2018-11-22 17:48:08 Saudis not the only game in town for oil. Incorrect misleading statements.  Dark Era of American history.
3929 2018-11-22 17:48:06 Fact check on the government's "glowing" economic report please.  Some facts so far:
Calgary, Alberta - 8.2% unemployment, 2nd to St. John's Newfoundland.
$80 million lost per day from the economy due to oil price gap.
Economic gymnastics by government bureaucrats much?
3930 2018-11-22 17:48:05 Ha! Basted in snake oil 
3931 2018-11-22 17:47:59 Excedrin is life-especially writhing the first 30 min. Drink a lot of water. Like, a lot. A small amount of caffeine. Avoid excessive light and sound. Nap. Take a bath-I use salts, lavender and peppermint oil. Prevention is another story...
3932 2018-11-22 17:47:57 And yet....most of the imported oil to the US is from Canada....
3933 2018-11-22 17:47:50 I'm still learning my new fryer....but this year's Thankgiving turkey fried great. I still need to get used to the jet burners putting all the heat to the center of the pot and wanting to scorch the peanut oil. But, it is a lot better than last year's turkey.
3934 2018-11-22 17:47:35 As the N Dakota oil fields shut down,throwing Americans out of work. Layoffs are increasing all over in different areas,different fields. Economy is about to tank. When oil is 2 high or 2 low,there's disruption. Keep kissing he head choppers' asses & you'll learn something.
3935 2018-11-22 17:47:34 Crude Oil Brent prices are sporadically falling again. Thoughts with my dear country Nigeria
3936 2018-11-22 17:47:34 it’s almost as if im contractually obligated to consume a gallon of olive oil a day
3937 2018-11-22 17:47:27 You live in Oklahoma. Oil prices are historically lower in OK because Oklahoma is close to the refineries and close to cheap domestic crude. So your state is an outlier.
3938 2018-11-22 17:47:21 It's got to vary state to state... I'm paying the lowest I've paid in years. However it is worth mentioning that oil prices are impacted by so many factors its asinine to give credit or place blame on any president for its price high or low.
3939 2018-11-22 17:47:20 Oil grabbed a pussy....this is by far the most truthful statement by a naive American president...Realpolitik..tik tok.
3940 2018-11-22 17:47:17 Ogoni clean up is on eternal óóóó.
 
But come to think of it.....
Can a govt that have no clue on how to manage Plastic, Nylon & sewage waste TRULY have a SOLUTION for Crude oil spill (ogoni land & water pollution)????

@MBuhari & @ProfOsinbajo are fraud to South South & Nigeria
3941 2018-11-22 17:47:15 Well when u support a country that exports oil a d kills an American citizen who happens to work for fake news as u call it with no ramifications from the USA of course gas prices are going to be low. I hope Iran does a blockade
3942 2018-11-22 17:47:12 It’s so awful. Plastic, fishing lines & nets, and oil spills. And if the oceans go, it’s bye bye life on earth.
3943 2018-11-22 17:47:00 Who’s in G20 are the Leader of this world,

By a speech from our king or our crown prince, the world economy can rise or drop dramatically,
By button press we control the oil price 

We are the Leader 
3944 2018-11-22 17:46:59 perfect day to stay in an eat an oil tanker loada food:)  #oott

3946 2018-11-22 17:46:58 @Skippy @Jif Please STOP using palm oil!!! You’re robbing orangutans of their habitats! I love your products, but now I can’t buy either of your products.  #nopalmoil #saveorangutanhabitats
3947 2018-11-22 17:46:58 there’s a school that only lets u major in oil or watercolor painting and i don’t get it
3948 2018-11-22 17:46:57 me: *choking on air because of jungkook’s vocals*

my mom: I have an essential oil for that...
3949 2018-11-22 17:46:47 Yes I would because once again your information only covers 2014 to 2016 at the height of the oil crash and is ironically much more of an indictment of the previous govt than the current  one
3950 2018-11-22 17:46:42 Only Nigerians will buy "anointing oil" for "protection" from a pastor with 7 body guards.
3951 2018-11-22 17:46:41 US buys about 40% of its oil from Canada.  Only 11% is from SA. So why isn’t he thanking Canadians for low gas prices ?
3952 2018-11-22 17:46:33 Same story for light oil Eric?
3953 2018-11-22 17:46:20 Eggs? Breakfast food. 
Oil? Key part of making things taste good. 
Solidified milk? Causes me gastrointestinal distress.
3954 2018-11-22 17:46:19 The end of implementation period you mean year 20XX?

Andrea you know very well this is a farce and you’re trading on a slippery slope. You need to maintain your relationship with the electorate don’t fall for May’s plan.

Don’t be a snakes oil salesperson selling a dead donkey.
3955 2018-11-22 17:46:18 Just a friendly reminder to Albertans that Jason Kenney's trade critic spent 10 months campaigning for Trump. who is now thanking a dictatorship that just murdered a US-resident journalist for suppressing the price of oil. Hes happy that Canadian oil is so cheap !
3956 2018-11-22 17:46:11 Podoba mi się film Gajar ki achar Pani me, oil free gajar ka achar, Sindhi achar gajar ka, gajar ka Pani wala achar, w @YouTube –
3957 2018-11-22 17:46:09 Naku madam @SenGracePOE mag senate hearing ulit kayo dahil bumababa ag gasolina at diesel, baka malugi mga oil companies. Madam @lenirobredo ipagpaliwanag mo gobyerno sa pag baba ng presyo. @bamaquino pasok, angkinin mo ito. @TrillanesSonny yung resibo, baka kumita si Du30!

3959 2018-11-22 17:46:01 Knitting whilst waiting for an oil change and the most delightful young man is fascinated by simple knit and purl. Very sweet.
3960 2018-11-22 17:45:58 Lol got oil today so all toastie! 
3961 2018-11-22 17:45:48 U have obviously never traded oil.  If u did u would know this is not true.  My people drive now and gas. Is going down.  Well if more people are driving oil should be 70-80 a barrel.  It will go back up after the holidays
3962 2018-11-22 17:45:47 Buddy blood for oil is the ENTIRE US -Saudi relationship. Our military protects their oil operations, they sell their oil in dollars.
3963 2018-11-22 17:45:25 wow...how often do you get oil changes?
3964 2018-11-22 17:45:24 City Girls got my whole ig timeline smelling like fish oil and boiled eggs man.. I’m sick of it 
3965 2018-11-22 17:45:20 This is from the CBC

Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
3966 2018-11-22 17:45:08 efficacent oil, vicks vaporub/inhaler, omega. UGHHHH!
3967 2018-11-22 17:45:07 I deal with this in Memphis all the time. I work in the public. I got hit up for money by a able bodied man I told him I have some money & I can give him a job & pay him as I needed some help cleaning oil dry at this repair site & he is like that sounds  like too much effort.
3968 2018-11-22 17:44:55 Oil based cream/spray to take it off. But its when you are washing the lace, there are so much residue. I use either washing up liquid or John Freda
3969 2018-11-22 17:44:53 Bullshit. The only reason the Middle East is a mean and nasty place is because we have been occupying their land and raping it of oil for decades. Now, we are dependent on the oil. Thanks G.W. Maybe find a way for America to be independent. #RenewableEnergyNow
3970 2018-11-22 17:44:13 They are not low enough to hurt us oil.  Would have to fall down o the 30 dollar level
3971 2018-11-22 17:44:10 Ah yes, rigging the lotteries
Colluding with big oil and the media for control over the Senate by rigging the fursuit lotteries
3972 2018-11-22 17:43:59 dipthongs are fucking fake actually and

3973 2018-11-22 17:43:59 Jamaican black castor oil, coconut oil!!
3974 2018-11-22 17:43:57 Castrol makes a concrete oil remover that works great.
3975 2018-11-22 17:43:57 its just a con-job from Saudi.  I would rather pay more in oil and not do business with a dictator that kills journalists.
3976 2018-11-22 17:43:56 I agree and I don’t sleep very well. I don’t think the long term solution is to invest more infrastructure money into oil infrastructure through. We need to protect our children’s future.  Mine don’t even want to have kids because of the struggle they will face.
3977 2018-11-22 17:43:56 Opened safari and the pictures of palm oil came up, I’m stressed all over again 
3978 2018-11-22 17:43:49 Hard to transition as you need money to make the changes, and sadly, oil provides a lot of money.  But should start working on other options that produce income
3979 2018-11-22 17:43:44 Hi Sahdia, in this instance once recovery arrived there were issues with the air brakes on the lorry. Our area team had to treat oil spilt from the lorry, which could only be done once the lorry itself was clear. Whilst this delayed re-opening this was due to safety.
3980 2018-11-22 17:43:43 The Witcher:
It was a cloudy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about big Boars. 'Use  Beast Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
3981 2018-11-22 17:43:37 Do you really have to oil pull for 20 mins?  That seems excessive.
3982 2018-11-22 17:43:35 ฝันดีนะคะ @iam_Oil
3983 2018-11-22 17:43:24 The poor will will become poorer with your budget, increasing fuel tax will mean will celebrate Christmas buying cooking oil at $20. Mark my words, I think you are the worst education Finance minister since independence.
3984 2018-11-22 17:43:23 It's format. 
Democrats will spend 5 min praising him and he only has to obfuscate in 5 min increments every other rep or claim national security prevents answering in open forum.
3985 2018-11-22 17:43:22 Yes, Let the OiL prices $tay LoW for Now. Allah gave them so much OiL
3986 2018-11-22 17:43:20 We’ve been trading blood for oil with the Saudis since 1945 ffs.

What’s new is the mask has slipped with Dump.
3987 2018-11-22 17:43:13 كمواطنين نحتاج تفسير وايضاح من الحكومة السعودية .

#السعودية
3988 2018-11-22 17:43:07 Seriously, do you ever research anything? Canada provides 40% of U.S. foreign oil compared to 11% from Saudi Arabia. Not only this but it is the markets that control the oil prices, not any one supplier or supplier country.
3989 2018-11-22 17:43:04 “I would say Grenadian but there’s no oil” 
3990 2018-11-22 17:43:02 He’s all buddies up to the Saudis...gotta well that oil. Maybe bump it up to 15% of foreign purchases this year. Shipping uses oil..it’s a win win for him and a loss for the climate.

3992 2018-11-22 17:42:53 Blood or oil? @realDonaldTrump picked oil?
3993 2018-11-22 17:42:52 Let not be hypocritical here now, all American governments had in the past since 1938,  and will in the future side with this regime as other western powers do and will, untill the oil runs out.
3994 2018-11-22 17:42:49 What does Vaginas have to do with the price of oil in China? Again I ask. When did Hillary's server get hacked people. It's a simple question. Where is the proof
3995 2018-11-22 17:42:46 Ikon Allah! So su matan they won’t know if he’s only interested in S neh or what?
3996 2018-11-22 17:42:40 Thou shall not murder, unless you have oil.  

Thou shall not commit adultery, unless you are rich, oppose abortion, and are willing to appoint conservative Supreme Court Justices.

Thou shall not lie, unless you promise to build walls.

The new values of the Christian right.
3997 2018-11-22 17:42:39 So if the Saudis murdered Ivanka and then promised to knock another $5 off per barrel of oil you'd be good with that, right? #SaudiArabiaFirst
3998 2018-11-22 17:42:33 Surely @itv can't condone snake oil quack Noel Edmonds to use #imaceleb as a platform to fight his personal legal battles? Can they?
3999 2018-11-22 17:42:30 Sorry what are the alternative to oil based products
4000 2018-11-22 17:42:28 Genuinely cannot believe the way Scotland have been treated throughout Brexit. It’s just like the top half of Britain doesn’t exist it’s mental... doesn’t exist until we try and take our North Sea Oil back anyway 
4001 2018-11-22 17:42:19 Assuming your team would have to tank to hire Sam Hinkie is like assuming Daniel Day Lewis has to play mustachioed oil men who abandon their boys. 

Win trades, invent creative contracts, find all NBA defenders off waiver wire. Fleece the King’s
4002 2018-11-22 17:42:09 Jamaican black and Castor oil 
Love it ,makes me feel untouchable
Again I love it
4003 2018-11-22 17:42:06 Because even as bad as “Blood for oil” sounds, the truth of trump is worse. He knows it.
4004 2018-11-22 17:41:56 The way the oil industry works is the best example of this. It’s extracted in south, but essentially all of the refineries are in the north. A curious thing, that.
4005 2018-11-22 17:41:41 Trump would have said he was a smart cookie, and held the respect of his people,invited him to the white house and then bragged about how he got the oil prices down because of it.
4006 2018-11-22 17:41:40 We don’t need the Saudi’s oil, dipweed. And you know it. Americans do not buy BLOOD OIL!
4007 2018-11-22 17:41:39 Do you think it was oil money behind the assassination ?
4008 2018-11-22 17:41:31 Truth.
4009 2018-11-22 17:41:16 How many gallons of oil is in there?
4010 2018-11-22 17:41:04 Sorry for the delay. We have cracked open labatt oil cans and my old man is already bitching about Obama. Liberal snowflake brother already talking about Hillary at least he’s drinking
4011 2018-11-22 17:41:04 The only CURE FOR obama IRAN DEBACLE IS DIRECT HITS TO FLATTEN REP GUARD MIL FACILITIES, NAVY, MULLAH HANGOUTS, ELECTRICAL GRID, OIL STORAGE & DROP SMALL ARMS TO CITIZENS FOR DEFENSE & OFFENSIVE USE!
4012 2018-11-22 17:41:01 Yeah, does that stuff really help? Like is there a difference you notice in yourself? Or is the oil only for cosmetic purposes?
4013 2018-11-22 17:41:00 I quit buying BP gas when they killed the Gulf of Mexico.   But I'm  hoping they lose more customers by crawling in bed with RU Oil.
4014 2018-11-22 17:40:58 @POTUS Pres Trump you waste too much time on Hillary's emails, unless you want to prove how Clintons/Obama/George W. Bush/Madeline Albright, more, use US/NATO Military Bases to loot Congo mines/oil reserves global, etc. Are you going to continue riding on this wave? Tell truth!
4015 2018-11-22 17:40:53 وانا معك ومع الشيخ سعد 
4016 2018-11-22 17:40:49 I think the palm oil campaign still has it's place in the media, of course it’s a marketing front, but they have found a way to gain a (financial) incentive through highlighting environmental issues, which to me is a win as it may encourage other cooperations to follow suit, 1/2
4017 2018-11-22 17:40:36 Imagine eating meals only seasoned with salt,pepper and olive oil 
4018 2018-11-22 17:40:33 u called it barbarism？ what about u and ur people that they r doing in syria,lebanon,palestine,iraq etc .is this not the barbarism of america u only want to get oil from that area and that the truth .u  cannot.deny it.
4019 2018-11-22 17:40:32 Dan, Quebec opposes pipelines while tankers cruise up the St. Lawrence to sell us oil for $60 wilecwe sell to US for $14. Why isn't this hypocrisy a bigger issue?
4020 2018-11-22 17:40:31 계유는..태왕의..으븝브(삐-) 입니다 너무 재밋어 따흑
4021 2018-11-22 17:40:31 The solution is more pipeline capacity to tide water. Exports to Asia and Europe.  Jason toured the largest refinery in India.  Open Canadian oil to world export markets.

4024 2018-11-22 17:40:24 Probably not even close to wine but I’d bet dollars to donuts that, if we viewed olive oil or prosciutto through a world lens, it would still be a very deep rabbit hole.
4025 2018-11-22 17:40:17 @CTVNews To fake news CTV- "Pass the buck Trudeau" blaming Trump tax cuts for his poor economic problems.  What about "80 million  dollars" a day it is costing Canadians for his mishandling of the oil problems in Alberta plus many more. Your Trudeau Gov. is a "Ship Of Fools".
4026 2018-11-22 17:40:10 おっぱいって結局は脂肪だろ？少し胸についてるからって僕を巨乳キャラにするなよ。
4027 2018-11-22 17:39:56 Was it all those tweets kissing the crown prince's ass that lowered oil prices? Why is it when good things happen you're boasting & tweeting &  taking all the credit - but let the stock market drop 500 points and it's the Democrats fault.  Why are you such a clueless asshole?
4028 2018-11-22 17:39:46 Overheard: I heard about a new way of cooking turkey. The whole bird is cooked in hot oil. It's not fried. It's cooked in hot oil.
4029 2018-11-22 17:39:45 Good question. I ask the same question of my gov't. We import oil to supply the eastern part of this country when there is plenty of ethical oil in the west. It makes no sense

4031 2018-11-22 17:39:20 He literally rescued the country in his first term. His hands are a little tied now because of the sanctions and the low oil prices. But those decisive interventions in Syria and Crimea... man’s a badass.
4032 2018-11-22 17:39:20 im sippin oil til my stomach fat , smokin OG til my lungs black.
4033 2018-11-22 17:39:19 Tell it to your base.   The rest of us know better.   We only get some of our oil from Saudi Arabia.   We produce more oil than they do.
4034 2018-11-22 17:39:18 The Founding Fathers did not care about low oil prices. They cared about the 1A and the Free Press. Shame on Trump. #Resist
4035 2018-11-22 17:39:17 3 counties control the price of oil. Saudi’s, Russia and USA
4036 2018-11-22 17:39:15 Lol you heard but I know only one man paid
4037 2018-11-22 17:39:13 Jaja, y también aplica como descripción gráfica del presupuesto que deberá presentar y aprobar el congreso para 2019...donde carajos establecerá precio del oil, T.C. etc?, y las reacciones del mercado.
4038 2018-11-22 17:39:12 Let's keep tabs on how many times I sneak out to hit the oil pen today, shall we?
4039 2018-11-22 17:39:10 @EKingstonBooks Don't know if it's up your alley, but Deciem is having a black friday sale on some of their products in case you use them. I'm taking advantage of it while ordering their rosehip oil at your suggestion ;D
4040 2018-11-22 17:39:09 So precious!  You need to have this one done in oil.
4041 2018-11-22 17:39:01 Apparently your Golden Cheeto Boy doesn't understand the petroleum industry either, since he tweeted a heartfelt "thank you" to Saudi Arabia thanking them for the low oil prices!  What does he understand besides spray tans???
4042 2018-11-22 17:38:55 Not likely. Russia supports Iran and China buys a lot of their oil. Saudi Arabia needs us as much we need them. If we told King Salman that he needs to lose MbS bc we can't do biz with a known murderer he'd probably be obligated to do so.

4044 2018-11-22 17:38:47 If we all stopped eating biscuits, and let’s face it that would be a good thing for our waistlines, we would be making a great contribution to removing palm oil from our diets.

4047 2018-11-22 17:38:32 Our leaders, by their actions, show us how insensitive and nonchalant they can be over sensitive sectors of the economy. If it's about the Senate or the oil sector, things will be resolved in a matter of days.
4048 2018-11-22 17:38:31 Why are Developed Democracies allowing the import of oil from  ?

We can place sanctions on this oil to send a strong message to the kingdom about human rights. There is lots of other oil.

4049 2018-11-22 17:38:31 I kind of feel like I’m going to throw up. Does anyone have an essential oil to help me to NOT barf? #essentialoils
4050 2018-11-22 17:38:31 The fact that Alberta’s economy is growing the fastest is completely measurable and verifiable. Painting Alberta as a struggling economy would be a surprise to most. I work oil and gas in N Ab and that’s not the perception. Carry on though
4051 2018-11-22 17:38:30 I’m plains and I use old oil when I can, it adds flavor
4052 2018-11-22 17:38:23 난 태왕이랑 계유의 관계가 제일 재밋어..커플로 파기엔 너무 개사약이지만 아무튼 재밋으면 그만이 아닌가(어?)글구 사람들 태양의 시 중에 가장 궁금해하는 포인트가 둘의 관계인것도 재밋어
4053 2018-11-22 17:38:15 They support our Curren$y by only selling oil in US dollars...

4056 2018-11-22 17:38:06 The impact of fall in oil price will lead Nigerians to suffer as it happen during  the first quarter of buhari administration which drop from 112$ barrel to 25$ per barrel
4057 2018-11-22 17:37:59 We should make CPEC oil route to China. Give this route to KSA for oil exports and Iran will feel the pain.
4058 2018-11-22 17:37:55 But our own oil!!!!!
4059 2018-11-22 17:37:48 Well simmer...in vegetable oil you can but that's for a whole different situation.
4060 2018-11-22 17:37:42 Castor oil, vitamin e hair grease, NO heat, get a trim every now and then, comb your hair when wet don’t brush it, use hot castor oil mixed w vitamin e( not too hot lol ) and rub your scalp upside down every day for 5 minutes or so, and hair mask!! 
4061 2018-11-22 17:37:32 Agree and meanwhile no assistance for the oil & gas sector while our neighbors down south are investing and expanding their oil & gas out-put in record numbers
4062 2018-11-22 17:37:30 Picking winners and losers, Doe. Oilfield worker's job is less important than the longshoreman's who unloads Saudi oil at the Port of Montreal?
4063 2018-11-22 17:37:00 Currently getting oil changed on the Beast... Looks like all other purchases are going to be on hold while I save for a new vehicle 
4064 2018-11-22 17:36:55 What happened to the Saudi Oil prices!
4065 2018-11-22 17:36:53 I’ll throw this out there. I don’t live in Alberta so I am not directly compelled to worry about a major part of the economy suffering. You live there and want badly to believe that the oil and gas industry is being done in by conspiracy of anti-fossil fuel voices.
4066 2018-11-22 17:36:51 Jokes on you. HAHAHA Did you know that when the prices of oil increase then the price of other commodities also follow. Mayayaman lng gumagamit so anong ginagamit ng jeepney drivers? Bahala kayo jan.
4067 2018-11-22 17:36:48 Can't wait to see you fly in a plane that runs on vegetable oil or solar panels! 
4068 2018-11-22 17:36:44 These are so cute! I love the triangle one with intricate wrap  Question: will the oil tranrish the wire?
4069 2018-11-22 17:36:43 @BAP_Bangyongguk @BAP_Himchan @BAP_Daehyun @BAP_Youngjae @BAP_Jongup @ZELO96 Goodnight 
4070 2018-11-22 17:36:39 Nestlé, Mcvites, Colgate, Sainsbury's own brand and the list goes on. When you check for the calories, fat, salt content, check the ingredients. I have only found 1 biscuit that still uses palm oil but from a sustainable palm farm.
4071 2018-11-22 17:36:37 Praising these murderers over low oil prices is disgraceful.  I've always been a strong conservative backer but this is bullshit.  Mr. Trump, do your job and be the President the people elected you to be.  Not a Saudi stooge!!!
4072 2018-11-22 17:36:31 Yes, they are!  They make snake oil in the basement.
4073 2018-11-22 17:36:19 Correct ...if Albertan's vote in another Conservative gov't after  years and years of blowing your oil money ...that would be CRAZY
4074 2018-11-22 17:36:14 Matt Patricia looks like he just got done changing the oil on his car.
4075 2018-11-22 17:36:10 "If we go by a certain standard then we won't have any allies" so basically  you're say you'd rather have cheap oil than confont this crime

He’s with Oil & Gas.

4080 2018-11-22 17:35:45 Trump: "Look at the Eye of the Hurricane, it's totally calm there.  Hurricane is a hoax!"  I know some people call you dumb for Tweets like this, but you know exactly what you are doing--shilling for the oil companies so you deny #ClimateChange.
4081 2018-11-22 17:35:36 @CBCNews -To fake news CBC- "pass the buck Trudeau" blaming Trump tax cuts  for his poor economic problems.   What about "80 million dollars" a day it is costing Canadians for his mishandling of the oil problems in Alberta and many more. Your  Trudeau gov, is  a "Ship Of Fools".
4082 2018-11-22 17:35:30 วันเพน แบบนี้ก็ได้หรอ 
4083 2018-11-22 17:35:29 You gotta date a saudí guy with oil money 
He bouta hit your DMs like open bob tho
4084 2018-11-22 17:35:28 Gas prices in Orange County California have never been higher than they are now. The price per barrel is only important if they oil companies lower their prices to reflect the lower price per barrel, they haven't done that the last two years.
4085 2018-11-22 17:35:20 Don't you know that there are other non oil sources of income? Have you forgotten that agriculture has seen a monumental boom in this administration? Look, we have money, okay! Lol
4086 2018-11-22 17:35:16 Don’t use all the fucking olive oil
4087 2018-11-22 17:35:13 Build the pipeline, then what? Sell more discounted oil to the US. There are no new buyers of this product. Get over it.
4088 2018-11-22 17:35:08 So was the olive oil, the prosciutto and the focaccia. They were all riven by place, variety, style and more. It was fascinating to see the appreciation of these nuanced and boutique versions of common products that expressed the product in so many different ways.
4089 2018-11-22 17:35:05 It will be big problem for Nigeria about the drop in crude oil price and our Government make it budget for 2018/2019 as 60$per barrel while it drop to 53.38per barrel let thing about the funding of 2019 budget and the impact of drop will course harsh economy and inflation.
4090 2018-11-22 17:35:03 You duped Russia and Saudi Arabia into over producing. The oil glut will hurt US producers resulting in layoffs. Thanks
4091 2018-11-22 17:35:02 Try putting a frozen bird in the hot oil.
4092 2018-11-22 17:34:58 Trump said thanks for lowering oil prices and says we want extra cuts. This is a case of involvement with a real estate dealer and has become a hostage. It will cut prices and pay 400 billion at the same time. It does not matter how, nor does it affect the economy of his country,
4093 2018-11-22 17:34:54 And this just proves all those times that gas prices went through the roof was all in greed. Isnt it amazing how a life can bring down oil prices? Dirty, dirty, dirty!!!
4094 2018-11-22 17:34:52 @_mariahjo_ ....hit a bunny and it ripped her oil pan off
4095 2018-11-22 17:34:45 Keep burning that Saudi oil, Doe. How do you sleep at night knowing the oil you use comes from a country that hangs gay people? You're OK with that?
4096 2018-11-22 17:34:41 Easier said than done I fear. Olive oil e.g. But I'll do my best.
4097 2018-11-22 17:34:28 When someone says “can someone pour this all over my body please?” You’d typically think they were talking about oil 
4098 2018-11-22 17:34:26 It’s so seasoned. The stuffing had fresh thyme, sage, and parsley. The turkey can’t be super seasoned because we fried it lol so any seasoning comes off in the oil.
4099 2018-11-22 17:34:20 Turmeric facial cleansing bar, Moringa oil (use as your daily facial moisturizer accompanied by SPF at all times), Soothing Tea Overnight Serum (use daily at night after cleansing),Green Tea Exfoliating Scrub (use twice a week) & Dead Sea mask + Vegan mask brush (use once/twice
4100 2018-11-22 17:34:19 Oil has nothing to do with free independent press. Most of our journalists are already under pressure because of being unionized   and now this.
All I know is for coming from a country where all press is subsidized, thus instructed what to report and opine
4101 2018-11-22 17:34:15 You did not lower gas prices, by the way we buy Little amount of oil from Saudi Arabia We buy wst more frim Canada...So stop Lying By he way how are your bone spurs?
4102 2018-11-22 17:34:02 Considering they built that big ass Racetrack & Resort in Dubai there's a lot of money Saudi oil money.
4103 2018-11-22 17:34:01 I watched some paint dry but it was oil paint so it took two weeks and that’s the tea
4104 2018-11-22 17:33:48 Have you tried soaking them overnight before cooking? Using a pressure cooker also helps. In Brazil, we also season the beans with garlic, you can put them on a separate pan with olive oil and salt, and add to the beans after they are cooked + bay leaf!
4105 2018-11-22 17:33:43 are you arguing about GC or GERS?

GERS includes oil revenue.

If you wan to argue about GC report then please argue with the "evil tory westminster scum" who produced the GC report......... 

*** BREAKING NEWS ***

GC REPORT WAS WRITTEN BY SNP MEMBERS & COMMISSIONED BY SNP !!!
4106 2018-11-22 17:33:42 @realDonaldTrump Smart move with Saudi Arabia ! If you sanctioned KSA and oil prices rise CNN would blame you .
4107 2018-11-22 17:33:24 Oil changes do not fit in my schedule...

4109 2018-11-22 17:33:15 When will you educate yourself before pouring garbage out of your mouth in your tweets. Only 11% of the oil comes from Saudi Arabia ... 40% comes from Canada. Please stop your lies.
4110 2018-11-22 17:33:06 The gvt expect 100% output but their are pay peanut. If you can't oil the machine don't expect 100% efficient as some of the energy will be lost as heat energy (stricks and stay in or away) and in the few year will will uneducated population

4112 2018-11-22 17:32:56 these are the facts. oil inflated our egos and its a crime to condemn it
4113 2018-11-22 17:32:51 I want the US to protect the idea of peace but I guess that’s a big issue when Saudi Arabia is our most important export of arms as well as import of oil so you see the correlation
4114 2018-11-22 17:32:48 Not sure where are these jobs are....America gets more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia. And do you think the Saudis will go elsewhere and make deals?? Where would they go.....America is in the drivers seat BUT 45 wants their business! SO SAD
4115 2018-11-22 17:32:48 you fill it with oil then light it, you can leave the cap off

4119 2018-11-22 17:32:28 Snake Oil
4120 2018-11-22 17:32:24 Tweetness already negotiated lower oil prices to keep gas prices down through the mid terms... the price will go up now regardless and tweetness will create fear and blame democrats.
4121 2018-11-22 17:32:14 people don’t get is drilling for oil destabilizes the earth’s crust causing earthquakes &release of poisons,including those oil co.s originally pumped into holes they drilled. they use extremely toxic chems to extract oil & do tests using radio active elements. #ThursdayThoughts
4122 2018-11-22 17:32:12 Shill for MBS, shill for Putin, shill for big oil. His only value is for their benefit.
4123 2018-11-22 17:32:10 We get 40% of our oil from Canada
4124 2018-11-22 17:32:09 I make my own vinegar but yes, already loads of good olive oil in stock ^^.
4125 2018-11-22 17:32:04 asking my chef son about seasoning potatoes he asks “do you have any garlic truffle oil?  I say “well I have ketchup “ #happythanksgivng
4126 2018-11-22 17:31:58 No one wants aid, we want pipelines.  That’s the only way to fix Alberta’s problems. It’s very simple.  Do you know how alberta ships it’s oil?
4127 2018-11-22 17:31:52 I love rose hip oil!!
4128 2018-11-22 17:31:47 Wish I could be there but I work in the oil and gas industry in rural Alberta & have to work today.  The company I work for has encouraged all Calgary employees to attend!
4129 2018-11-22 17:31:39 The CIA just informed you that the Saudi Prince ordered the torture and execution of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Your message to the world is to thank him for oil prices...That’s what you’re thankful for?!?!?
4130 2018-11-22 17:31:38 Good! That so called journalist supported the Muslim Brotherhood and was a traitor!! Besides my SUV and speed boat needs cheap oil!!
4131 2018-11-22 17:31:37 I got this body oil though, my dude you gotta try it and see how it work for you lol..
4132 2018-11-22 17:31:30 Even if I use oil to moisturize the back of my feet it won’t work
4133 2018-11-22 17:31:28 If you had ANYTHING AT ALL to do with lower oil prices, you would be responsible for the loss of thousands of US jobs in OUR oil fields.  You do know we produce HUGE amount of oil when the explorers can afford to produce it!
4134 2018-11-22 17:31:22 A full body massage  hot oil and all 
4135 2018-11-22 17:31:17 We should not be fighting in Yemen. We don't need Saudi's oil, so we tell them to shove it with our best Thanksgiving-y tone.

Obama got a Nobel peace prize a few years before he started to more warfronts and drive striking US citizens. Too much hypocrisy.
4136 2018-11-22 17:31:06 Did you know @Minnie_Yaniz that the newspapers in Europe and are subsidized? I have watched great community newspapers close and worry that we will lose them all. Also, after B in oil subsidies, I think this is a small amount.
4137 2018-11-22 17:31:03 As Trump says we need  them for there oil or gas prices would spike, BULL SHIT they supply 15% of out oil Canada supply us with 40%
4138 2018-11-22 17:31:00 Absolutely Curtis & Dave! Paul has sold every bit of his essence (soul) to the highest bidder which happen to be Oil & Gas & the extraction businesses. Interestingly, some of them are foreign corps. What about America 1st? He needs to change his last name then resign!
4139 2018-11-22 17:30:57 Hey folks we only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. So, I guess it's worth brutally taking one man's life. At least to some it is. Should we  call this THE NEW AMERICAN WAY?
4140 2018-11-22 17:30:49 US and the West now controls the oil which was all that matters.
4141 2018-11-22 17:30:45 태왕님은 평소 궁인들이 머리 관리 열심히 해줘서 긍가..머리가 매끈매끈한데 계유는 머리 존나 막 쓰고 관리 안 해서 북슬북슬해..같은 머릿결임에도...성격에 따라 큰 차이가 있엉ㅋㅋㅋ
4142 2018-11-22 17:30:44 These Saudi Camel Jocks got lucky they struck oil.. US got lucky tgat they did.. The Jocks export oil, earn Petro-dollars, and return it to US in exchange for Arms they never needed in the first place..
4143 2018-11-22 17:30:33 Alaskans own 1,293,100 shares of BUMI ARMADA BHD, worth $219,145. It's from the OIL SERVICES sector, based in MALAYSIA.
4144 2018-11-22 17:30:32 Excuse me, it's not just oil and weapon interests. We share the value of human values, we cooperate to expose false propaganda such as the Washington Post and CNN, we want the world free from the wars and terror that Obama has brought.

4147 2018-11-22 17:30:06 It was from 2014-2016 in the midst of the oil crash.
4148 2018-11-22 17:30:05 who said it was a mistake?? Who now controls all that Lybian oil??
4149 2018-11-22 17:30:00 The onus lies on the Apex bank to think less of oil as the major foreign exchange spinner and look inwards for foreign exchange generation.The outlook for oil prices is weak and that itself is a huge concern in all entirety.
4150 2018-11-22 17:29:58 He is going to call for the return of sweet whale oil next. The whale oil industry will bring many jobs, big numbers, big whales. Steam powered harpoons.
4151 2018-11-22 17:29:56 Oil prices were lower after US crude inventories rose to their highest level since December, adding to concerns about a global supply glut
4152 2018-11-22 17:29:54 Activated charcoal or turmeric (making a paste with coconut oil is good)...both are not fun but effective.
4153 2018-11-22 17:29:49 Make sure it's completely thawed and dry before going in that oil.  Nothing ruins Thanksgiving faster than a burnt house.
4154 2018-11-22 17:29:39 In response to outrage over Saudi regime-tied murder, Trump says people should not be too mad at Saudis  given low oil prices
4155 2018-11-22 17:29:38 I been taking this medication that has peppermint oil in it and it’s really helping!
4156 2018-11-22 17:29:36 If it ain’t peanut oil. I DONT WNAT IT
4157 2018-11-22 17:29:32 Happy Thanksgiving. Let's remember the natives who had their land stolen, were beaten, sprayed with fire hoses last year during freezing temperatures because they wanted to protect their water. Sadly that pipeline was built and already leaked 200,000 gallons of oil.
4158 2018-11-22 17:29:28 Shut the oil and gas off to BC, Quebec and Ontario and see how high @JustinTrudeau jumps, its election year.
4159 2018-11-22 17:29:23 As mentioned in a previous comment, Canada has little to do with global oil prices. OPEC has a lot to do with it.
4160 2018-11-22 17:29:19 You lying piece of.......   You had nothing to do with the oil prices.
4161 2018-11-22 17:29:16 The Left wants Americans 2 suffer & eventually the USA 2 go the way of the Roman Empire.  It's Y they R so adamant on infusing cultures that R incompatible w/a homogeneous society.  It's tantamount 2 mixing motor oil in mashed potatoes & forced U 2 eat it.
4162 2018-11-22 17:29:01 Oil or? can you send me a full frame? Hard to see  the brush stroke.
4163 2018-11-22 17:28:48 Canada loves that Saudi oil
4164 2018-11-22 17:28:29 Very sad. Irony of deficient #natgas transport into NE due to #renewables idealism, @isonewengland is using fuel oil and coal for 10% of the supply mix, while millions $$$ fly out of people and business pockets and income statements
4165 2018-11-22 17:28:27 Who’s the largest importer of America oil? And who’s the world largest producer of oil? When last human rights took the back burner to economic profits for America
4166 2018-11-22 17:28:25 Fossil fueled America on the go this Thanksgiving, a way of life that depends on cheap oil provided by the Saudi Kingdom and the other OPEC nations. We are all complicit. 'There Will Be Blood' ....  rfl
4167 2018-11-22 17:28:09 bts should be in a loreal commercial their hair should be crispy but their locks still be so damn luscious what oil u use sis
4168 2018-11-22 17:28:05 It's same game. Russia, China United States are stealing the world while they pretend to be at odds. US & Russia help to create failed states in Middle East, Central Asia and Africa. China goes into the failed states and rapes the resources. US and Russia benefit from high oil
4169 2018-11-22 17:28:01 You mean the alternative to the petrodollar? Why is everyone talking about Saudi Arabia like it doesn't represent the denomination of the world's oil into American currency?  I thought this was page one on Present Day Foundation of Bourgeois Power Structure 101...
4170 2018-11-22 17:27:52 If we never bought another drop of oil from Saudi Arabia they’ll sell it to someone else & then we’ll buy from the country that was selling to that person,it’s a Global Market,we sanction Iran they sell to others .Republicans must get pass their racism for the good of their kids
4171 2018-11-22 17:27:27 Giving thanks for Saudi oil so we don’t have to worry about that journalist that just got sawed to pieces.
4172 2018-11-22 17:27:27 Romania denies it strongly, but do they have oil??
4173 2018-11-22 17:27:27 Pacific Rim je samo visokobudžetni treš, jer je priča jako slaba u filmu. Uzmi drugi dio za primjer, čisti treš xD 
Prvi je dobar jer je kvalitetno urađen + a big-ass robot slamming an oil tanker into a kaiju's face is the best shit ever
4174 2018-11-22 17:27:17 Trump just stop tweeting your delusional propaganda and lies, What a bunch BULL, many Billions of Dollars of purchases made in U.S., big Jobs & Oil, just stop making things up.
4175 2018-11-22 17:27:05 @JohnRos87202439 as a ex oil field , pro pipeline ( my father was part of the 1952  build ) I always admired Vivian for her years of investigation .......but I part company for who she supports ( too much fake and misleading  news )
4176 2018-11-22 17:27:01 Oil for Blood.
4177 2018-11-22 17:26:55 Plus, the addition of 2.5 gallons of boiling oil and wine drinking make for an outstanding adrenaline rush.
4178 2018-11-22 17:26:47 Maybe one of the lessons for us to learn is that connecting everything together isnt necessarily a great idea. I wonder how the DEC engineers would have reacted back then if told that in 30 years everything from coffee pots to oil refineries would be connected regardless of need.
4179 2018-11-22 17:26:43 We need to start saying.. the love of Saudi oil instead
4180 2018-11-22 17:26:41 Well Dnny, I think that since we send you almost 4 x the oil that the Saudis do, how about saying you like us 4 x as much ... not that I want to be liked by you.
4181 2018-11-22 17:26:35 Crude Oil decreased 0.83 USD/BBL or 1.52% to 53.69 on Thursday November 22 from 54.63 in the previous trading session. Next time #Trump Google it...Oh by the way ...what did you have to do with it anyway?
4182 2018-11-22 17:26:26 Stretchy pants and peppermint oil. Don’t tell anyone.
4183 2018-11-22 17:26:26 Good book to read on this “The Deep Hot Biosphere”. About abiotic origins of petroleum, counter to current myth that its “fuel from fossils”, but instead it’s plentiful and part of the earth. Myth of scarcity created by Big Oil cartel to try to keep prices elevated.
4184 2018-11-22 17:26:25 พอแล้ว จบแยก
4185 2018-11-22 17:26:07 Very simple they want to impeach the governor who declined their offer to join the Devils gang APC They want an oil state, knowing fully well that they can only try that nonsense with the Akwa ibom gov, they need the oil money for 2019 vote buying
They want to Rig Uyo for Buhari
4186 2018-11-22 17:26:06 Pleaseeeee Do, I honestly NEED to see your reaction to the bumblekiss
4187 2018-11-22 17:25:49 for pity's sake,  teach your managers about #mentalhealthissues an ill thought comment can set someone back weeks

4189 2018-11-22 17:25:38 ICYMI: Panibagong oil price rollback, nakikitang ipatupad sa susunod na linggo #TomorrowsNewsTonight #DZRHNationwide @doe_ph
4190 2018-11-22 17:25:35 Mahathir requested our PM for easing of regulatory duty on palm oil. Pakistan imports p oil from Malaysia & Indonesia of $4-5 B. More, Mahathir invited Pakistani entrepreneurs for investing in Malaysia when our PM spoke truth that Pakistan is a corrupt & money laundering.
4191 2018-11-22 17:25:34 I can’t wish Jimmy all the best because he blocked me. No doubt he’ll sell out of snake oil...
4192 2018-11-22 17:25:33 Lavender oil is so relaxing
4193 2018-11-22 17:25:29 @MicheleBachmann 
I’m sure the evangelical Jesus would be for killing and butchering a man to keep oil prices down!

These people are sick, amoral and twisted. Don’t they know the commandments?
4194 2018-11-22 17:25:24 Amazing that you’re actually bragging about your efforts to make oil a more attractive fuel. Maybe when the planet is utterly wrecked, we can erect a small monument to your “affordable hydrocarbons”.
4195 2018-11-22 17:25:20 Got coconut oil all over my shirt 
4196 2018-11-22 17:25:12 We get 7% of our oil from Saudis.
Canada & Mexico provide us much more oil & are our allies & you treat them like shit. You've already boasted how much $ you make off the Saudis. It's ur & @jaredkushner bank accounts your protecting. Your economy, not OURS. #BloodMoney
4197 2018-11-22 17:25:04 @LillyLeBlance S.A will make you pay more at the pump whether you like it or not. If you do not want to use Saudi oil, you can always switch to electric cars anytime. One costumer lost. Good riddance!!
4198 2018-11-22 17:25:03 @realDonaldTrump saying he would let anybody get away with murder, as long as it is for money and cheap oil. This is the kind of person we want in the White House?
4199 2018-11-22 17:24:56 @AmbJohnBolton  i finished my investigation of the largest  smuggling Iranian oil to Iraq  photos of trucks trailers tankers , factory & registration in ERBIL traffic police Basrah  Muftia depot  , routes   it is  2.4 billion USD  monthly.+09647503807030
4200 2018-11-22 17:24:56 And you export oil to them. See the connection.
4201 2018-11-22 17:24:53 Do YOU not understand the global oil futures market, or are you just counting on your supporters not understanding it?
4202 2018-11-22 17:24:52 Baby oil gonna keep your skin from stretching to its ripping point.
4203 2018-11-22 17:24:42 Most. of. the. oil. we. BUY.

4206 2018-11-22 17:24:21 They figured the world fears their oil as much as Trump. SaudiFail. I'd rather ride my bike than bow to the pressure of murderers.
4207 2018-11-22 17:24:21 Could not negotiate your way out of an oil drum. 
4208 2018-11-22 17:24:20 Bring the price for oil down lower.
4209 2018-11-22 17:24:19 Ha ha, you’re a huge exporter of oil! You can have all the environmental standards you want at home, when you’re polluting the rest of the planet for self interest and greed. It’s called hypocrisy.
4210 2018-11-22 17:24:17 I love John Dean's tweet for its content and for calling the twip by his name and not as fucking 'Mr. Pissident'. Thank you John for not undermining the decorum of the office of POTUS. don the con, snake oil salespimp
4211 2018-11-22 17:24:10 The Alberta economy grew 4.4% in 2017 despite $20 WCS Oil and without cuts to essential services. Please find me the last time that happened, I’m waiting over here with great anticipation.
4212 2018-11-22 17:24:02 Complained about my oil change cost and my mom tells me that’s what I get for having a foreign car 

Dodge and Jeep cars use the same oil filter, lady
4213 2018-11-22 17:24:02 Wuse market entrepreneurs. I stan 
4214 2018-11-22 17:24:02 So...then any American citizen can be slaughtered by any of these monsters, and there would be no repercussions. Because of $$. Got it. American lives worthless. Oil $$ good. #bebestasshole
4215 2018-11-22 17:23:56 At this point if you still oppose a price on carbon you are a Collaborator with the Axis of Oil Fascists.
4216 2018-11-22 17:23:54 So fam, I need a small supply of rice, groundnut oil and Maggi. I need abt 5bags of rice and 16-1liter of Goil. Pls help retweet, you might help someone make the money. Tnks @segalink @TrafficChiefNG
4217 2018-11-22 17:23:48 The baby oil part
4218 2018-11-22 17:23:27 One palm oil company has destroyed an area of forest half the size of Paris. 

PepsiCo, Mars, Nestle, Unilever - companies that have promised not to buy palm oil from forest destroyers - are all supporting the destruction.

That needs to stop. 

#deforestation #PalmOil …
4219 2018-11-22 17:23:24 For all sane people it's hard to side with a murderer for a few oil drums. Sad that you are not sane and support Saudi Arabia, North Korea and Russia over the CIA. #unpatrioticbot
4220 2018-11-22 17:23:23 Jr. will be in Calgary today. Let's see how it goes... Will see if the media cover his confrontation with angry Canadians as he is ruining Alberta's Oil sand industry
4221 2018-11-22 17:23:23 But on world stock markets price of oil is at lowest level in a year
4222 2018-11-22 17:23:00 Those in the USA should count their blessings that politicians like May have made a career out of ensuring that the US gets our oil at a deep discount.
4223 2018-11-22 17:22:58 Depende siguro type of vaccine kasi may water-based and oil based. Pero yes, good luck. 
4224 2018-11-22 17:22:56 se eu te disser que nunca cheguei a cogitar uma relação entre a derrubada do oil e a proximidade do leilão da onerosa, estarei mentindo !!

hehehe
4225 2018-11-22 17:22:50 เหยยยยยย
4226 2018-11-22 17:22:42 Maybe Palm Oil, or Beef Ranching, or the Airlines, or oil companies, or Fukushima, or overfishing, or each and everyone of the 7+ billion of us.

4228 2018-11-22 17:22:37 "Saudi Arabia is discussing a proposal to cut oil output by as much as 1.4 million barrels per day by OPEC and its allies, sources close to the discussions told Reuters earlier this month." source @Reuters
4229 2018-11-22 17:22:33 Oh, the dinosaur float is brought to us by an oil company? That seems a bit on the nose.
4230 2018-11-22 17:22:30 She supported invading other nations, destabilizing their governments and their economies to benefit her oil industry donors, and refugees are the result. She's helped to create that problem, and now she blames them for electing politicians who oppose what she does.
4231 2018-11-22 17:22:29 In my town there is a Shiva (Siddeshwar) & Lord Rama temple where this festival (of lights) is celebrated.
Every year I celebrate- lighting oil lamps at the Shiva Temple.
All these years I believed we wer celebrating Gurunanak Jayanti.
Recently I realised it is Tripurari Pornima
4232 2018-11-22 17:22:22 it’s olive oil
4233 2018-11-22 17:22:19 Sinclair Oil has dinosaurs in the parade. Nothing like taking one of the most miserable topics of oil and gas prices and making it better with cute cartoony baby dinosaurs. #Snarksgiving2018
4234 2018-11-22 17:22:19 Sure,instead use lemon or bikarbonat oil mixture as natu.deo.l personaly use wth.alkohol ,very sensitive skin.He though can use other things (seeing that Parris is just under pits)
4235 2018-11-22 17:22:07 Dry brined and deep fried in peanut oil.
4236 2018-11-22 17:22:06 Nice try, trump! Lower oil prices are not like a tax cut!!!
4237 2018-11-22 17:22:00 Ottawa has already purchased a pipeline company to try to get oil to the BC coast. They are heavily invested monetarily and politically.
4238 2018-11-22 17:21:56 You kind of failed big time in the oil industry. Thousands of jobs lost. Never came into being because your government doesn't support pipelines.
4239 2018-11-22 17:21:53 CAN YOU JUST MAKE OIL PRICE IN JORDAN GET LOWER AS WELL ;C
4240 2018-11-22 17:21:40 #24hPujadas comment se fait il qu en espagne on repercute tout de suite la baisse du gas oil et nous il faut desmois???? Les espagnols sont ils cons?
4241 2018-11-22 17:21:29 Canada is selling America most of its oil lower prices thanks to CANADA !
4242 2018-11-22 17:21:28 Ah well, fair enough. Can't blame me for trying to rope you in. Side note: one of the winning fourth-year engineering projects was about finding better ways to clean up oil spills. Even better would be not spilling in the first place...
4243 2018-11-22 17:21:24 Is it wrong that I baste my turkey in just olive oil and pepper? And it comes out friggen awesome every time.
4244 2018-11-22 17:21:23 Also, everyone needs to be supportive of Blockchain. As "Data is the new Oil", Blockchain is what will keep Data running. Every process will be facilitated by the Blockchain. #Blockchain
4245 2018-11-22 17:21:19 TRUMP. TELL THE FAKE NEWS TO GO TO HELL AND THAT AMERICA WILL TRADE $54 OIL A BARREL ANY DAY FOR ANY ARAB ON ANY DAY. ENOUGH OF THE BS. ON KHASHOGGI.
4246 2018-11-22 17:21:17 Gotta keep slathering on baby oil on your stomach, so you don't get any more stretch marks today
4247 2018-11-22 17:21:07 You do know that 70% of our oil comes from Canada right?  20% is from our own country... so why are you lying to the people again?
4248 2018-11-22 17:21:00 I spilled a lemon juice, olive oil and tanihi dressing on my outfit, so I’m taking this is a positive and pretending I smell like @ottolenghi staff today.
4249 2018-11-22 17:21:00 A paint rubber of rice

4252 2018-11-22 17:20:54 the navy runs on oil
4253 2018-11-22 17:20:53 Much better for Canada to import oil, right?  Hey, while we're at it, why not import our milk, our grain and everything else. That way Canada can rest on its laurels and not produce anything.
4254 2018-11-22 17:20:53 Remember to capitalize Jobs & Oil and you will nail it next time.
4255 2018-11-22 17:20:51 Meanwhile in Canada,we have a government in power that has done everything it can 2 hold us hostage to foreign oil! #Treason
4256 2018-11-22 17:20:50 Cut off the hair oil supply and poof, no more Bill Maher.
4257 2018-11-22 17:20:42 Oil revenues should never have been put into the general coffers in the first place as it is one time but we have had 13 years of populist governments that increase the budget 45% since the early 00s - Overspending by $1 billion plus a year for 13 years has crippled NLs economy
4258 2018-11-22 17:20:35 I’m over 700 miles for an oil change
4259 2018-11-22 17:20:28 Different pencils, some cool colored pens i have, Watercolor pencils, oil colors acrylics and some random art supplies
4260 2018-11-22 17:20:22 Less than 15% of U.S. oil imports come from Saudi Arabia. We import nearly 3 times more oil from Canada. Thank you, Canada! Of course Trump & family don't have nearly as many business dealings w/ Canada as they do w/ Saudi Arabia. So why aren't you harder on the Saudis and MBS?
4261 2018-11-22 17:20:13 Of course it is the politicians fault that the oil prices are falling
4262 2018-11-22 17:20:11 So low.. price per barrel of oil was lower 2 years ago
4263 2018-11-22 17:20:06 For Controlling Sugar levels, take KarunSeeragam, Vendhayam, Omam each equal measure. Fry each separately in dry pan without oil. After cooling, grind all three to nice powder. Mix them together well.  One tea spoon with warm water daily twice. Preferably before food.
4264 2018-11-22 17:20:02 Only possible explanation I can think of for that is IMF thinks the bad guys want to nuke the Canadian oil industry
4265 2018-11-22 17:19:59 Gas prices have nothing to do with you and everything to do with the oil cartels. BTW, the cartels are planning to cut oil production and raise rates soon.
4266 2018-11-22 17:19:57 Shit can be composted, oil cannot, but that doesn’t mean I want to see turds floating by me at the beach!  Raw sewage should never be dumped untreated into any water system and even after treatment, how safe is it?
4267 2018-11-22 17:19:54 Frying plantain/yam with fish oil is a crime
4268 2018-11-22 17:19:38 Igual cuando le nombras ‘Venezuela’ a un inglés se quedan pensando unos minutos y te dicen: “...oil? ”
4269 2018-11-22 17:19:35 Trump is ignorant. He doesn’t know that most of our oil comes from Canada. Maybe he’d act nicer to our neighbors
4270 2018-11-22 17:19:28 Bolt you are on your way, It's looking good, just comb it every once in a while and use a oil to keep it looking long and strong!
4271 2018-11-22 17:19:28 Seizing all assets of oil companies and stopping production and importing of oil.
4272 2018-11-22 17:19:24 "I'm in oil, but I'm not a sardine" - early draft of that Killers track.
4273 2018-11-22 17:19:21 This is what happens when you get rid of all the scientists and replace them with oil and coal lobbyists. You also need a President who is not the sharpest tac in the box.
4274 2018-11-22 17:19:16 Have oil stocks bottomed? Two days of green unheard of for them lately
4275 2018-11-22 17:19:11 No the fact is the POTUS doesn’t have the power to impact oil prices regardless if your Donald J Trump. Your narcissist self is loathing. Your tremendous ego is sickening. But instead of thanking people, family or friends for all you are and have...YOU have to tweet lies?
4276 2018-11-22 17:19:01 Peu importe, si les GJ n'avaient pas commencé samedi, il n'y aurait pas eu tous ces dégâts, humains et matériels. Tout ça pour quelques centimes sur le litre de gas oil qui déjà est moins cher qu'il y a 2 semaines.
4277 2018-11-22 17:18:58 There isn't such as thing as responsibly sourced Palm oil. X
4278 2018-11-22 17:18:56 水(ウォーター)とは仲が悪いです。
4279 2018-11-22 17:18:54 I wonder what country those nice peopl are from. They are certainly not from Canada. A country that exports its oil, for many times less than what it costs them to import.
4280 2018-11-22 17:18:52 Somalis are in U.S Congress, Ministers in Canada, city mayors in England and own biggest businesses in East Africa. President of ICJ, #somalia is not short of talented people. Strong revenue is what the government needs and oil and gas is the biggest, right now.
4281 2018-11-22 17:18:46 Nivea oil in lotion rose
4282 2018-11-22 17:18:44 !!! I will give you your Argan oil when the order arrives 
4283 2018-11-22 17:18:43 @POTUS @bin_crown  Can't believe CIA, history of Obama/Clintons/Bush, for starters, as all of their teams have killed millions over looting the Congo mines/oil, put in puppet Govs, yet you heard what from CIA/FBI/EPA/IAEA.. the earth is circulating toxic rads/climate change/more!
4284 2018-11-22 17:18:39 Yep, you're beleaguered right wing media industry.

Now tell us again how we need to bail out car companies and the oil industry.
4285 2018-11-22 17:18:39 @kylegriffin1 40 percent of u.s oil comes from CANADA AND 30 through MEXICO we dont need SAUDIS OIL
4286 2018-11-22 17:18:37 Cheers and thanks to the death of the fossil fuels, the men and women who have fought to make it happen, and, of course, to those who won’t be bathing in oil any longer. It was the latter who made this possible with their fear of change.
4287 2018-11-22 17:18:27 Looking for a bounce in oil related names in dec...   small cap name to watch is pei.v...low marketcap...volatile...entry perhaps 12 cents...target 36 cents 7 months out...
4288 2018-11-22 17:18:27 $rig $ne #oil
4289 2018-11-22 17:18:20 Acrylic paints are extremely versatile and dry very quickly compared to oil paints. Acrylic paint can be used straight from the tube or thinned with water or another paint medium and be used like watercolor. But because they dry so fast, only use a little bit at a time.
4290 2018-11-22 17:18:06 Oil first, profit first, zilch support for  an innocent, brave mans slaughter.  But brave is something you have no knowledge of, torture you consider wet hair...... hero’s you consider dictators to be.  Hell will welcome you eagerly.
4291 2018-11-22 17:17:52 It's not just one product mondelez has palm oil in, it's nearly all of them.

The whole idea of veganism is to not have animal products. So if they don't mind a bit of cow in their products why can't they just have vegetarian food
4292 2018-11-22 17:17:42 Twitter, help! I've just tried my first fully Palm oil - free shampoo and... argh! It's held so much residue in my hair it's unreal. I won't mention the brand because it's unfair. How can I solve this? Rinse with vinegar? #palmoil #palmoilfree #PalmOilAlarmCall #Orangutans
4293 2018-11-22 17:17:35 Another long day and late night for our team and  Swan Support another oil spill.This time from Perivale to Ladbrook grove. This time black oil. 

Thank you to the rspca for their most welcome assistance!
4294 2018-11-22 17:17:22 Liar!  Blood is on your hands for Khashoggi — the Saudis need to be punished not applauded for oil!  We see through you.. #LiarInChief
4295 2018-11-22 17:17:18 Like oil on water Charley
4296 2018-11-22 17:17:03 If only you understood oil prices and supply and demand. The more oil that is produced and sit in tankers in the middle east the lower oil prices drop. You are brainless.
4297 2018-11-22 17:17:01 I’m thankful for my Grandma, moving very soon, seeing Timmy and Kerry’s plays even sooner, meeting @louselby soooo soon, and Verb Ghost Oil (dead serious, it makes my hair look so nice )
4298 2018-11-22 17:17:01 Sorry Donald, but low gas prices are a result of a free market economy, supply and demand. Where did you go to school? Unless you are personally drilling and pumping crude oil, you have done nothing other than coddle those responsible for 9/11. Go eat your turkey and watch tv.
4299 2018-11-22 17:16:57 If that's what you think, go to your Sainsbury's as an example because it's near to me. Out of all the biscuits available fron all brands, the only one that is marked as made with sustainable palm oil, is "Garibaldi buiscuits by Sainsbury's". Funnily enough, I love them even b4.
4300 2018-11-22 17:16:54 We should thank Canada not Saudi Arabia for our low oil prices. We should work with Canada and act nicer
4301 2018-11-22 17:16:43 アイバーンとか言うやつどう対処したらいいんだ〜〜
4302 2018-11-22 17:16:40 2/3 were compared to wine. Though I’m intellectually curious I have no real desire to become passionate about olive oil or focaccia, I just want to enjoy decent versions of both. Now prosciutto on the other hand . . .
4303 2018-11-22 17:16:34 How long has America been allies with Canada? We stood up to Saudi and paid a price, even our ambassador got kicked out. Oh, and you get 40% of your oil from us so stop using oil as an excuse.
4304 2018-11-22 17:16:34 switching from sunscreen to oil today... brb, bout to get savage
4305 2018-11-22 17:16:33 Kasi wakatora argan oil yangu??

4308 2018-11-22 17:16:20 Is your N1 missing?  When it comes to oil money,  every is Nigerian,  outside that back to their tribes. Shamless thieves.

4311 2018-11-22 17:15:51 Your lardarse caused an oil slick
4312 2018-11-22 17:15:47 Fry the turkey(not like bread it and stuff, straight up get a huge boiling pot of veggie oil and yeet that turkey in there.) it will be the best turkey you have ever eaten
4313 2018-11-22 17:15:47 Gingelly oil 
4314 2018-11-22 17:15:43 What else is new. Oil energy giants morphing to Green algae and wind turbines, it's an end of old ways of doing things.
4315 2018-11-22 17:15:32 Oil
4316 2018-11-22 17:15:29 But the tankers will continue up the St. Lawrence to the Quebec refineries to sell us oil at the world price.Are Canadians really this stupid?
4317 2018-11-22 17:15:26 I will happily pay higher oil prices,to bring the murderer to justice.
4318 2018-11-22 17:15:24 See, I gain weight much easier when I eat the heavy fat sources. Did a lot of it with peanut butter. Added butter or olive oil to everything. Incorporated sweet potatoes back into the diet post workout.
4319 2018-11-22 17:15:12 Guten tag, it's Olive Oil. Somebody's been speculating if after all these moments you'd like to protest.
4320 2018-11-22 17:15:05 but NOTHING for struggling Alberta oil and gas industry, do you not understand this? there's not even a mention of Alberta there.
4321 2018-11-22 17:15:03 Fully synthetic oil I hope Sean 
4322 2018-11-22 17:15:02 I was just gonna complain that she has more cbd oil than the two of us combined so there goes my Xmas gift
4323 2018-11-22 17:14:59 Thank you! 
All products have complexity. The question is how far does someone want to go up the expert curve & what starts one’s jouney? I just watched Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat & in the 1st show I was reminded of the incredible variation of prosciutto, olive oil, & focaccia. 1/
4324 2018-11-22 17:14:56 I preface this statement saying I’m willing to allow a free market and $10/gallon gas but you had better be willing to accept it as well if you sanction Saudi’s oil.  Candidly it’s the only sanction that would matter.
4325 2018-11-22 17:14:54 Thou Shalt Not Kill

-Unless you play for my condos and give us that sweet Saudis oil, and buy our weapons to continue to cause millions of dead children in Yemen.

Trump is Godless and so are his followers.
4326 2018-11-22 17:14:48 I’ll take $2.249 all day everyday, better than $3bucks a gallon.  I’m one of those that bough gas for 19cents a gallon  in the mid 60s . The days of gas wars and full service stations, check the oil and clean the windows for free.
4327 2018-11-22 17:14:45 CA's Central Valley has been deep Red for decades, might as well be Mid-West, but it's changing.  McCarthy and his little buddy Nunes may be the last R's left.  Kevin has the Oil workers behind him, but Devin needs bamboozled farmers to keep his seat.
4328 2018-11-22 17:14:43 President Trump knows exactly what happened but he puts America first. He will use this matter to control the crown prince of Saudi Arabia on so many issues. Trades,oil prices and policies in the Middle East. We are dealing with a smart businessman who cares about his country
4329 2018-11-22 17:14:42 me to cal : im scared thats why im studying oil and gas now

we both look at my laptop screen : facebook 

:D
4330 2018-11-22 17:14:39 And oil prices only go down when the planet cools off.

Things shrink when temperatures fall..

Easy.

One do not have to be a rocket surgeon to figure this out.
4331 2018-11-22 17:14:34 They are NOT our ally. We get most of our oil from Canada and at better prices. So that argument is out. The ONLY reason Drumpf wants to keep the relationship with Saudi is personal. Kushner and Drumpf have personal financial ties in the millions. 

It’s that simple.
4332 2018-11-22 17:14:18 So Gaza is your future oil field? Then I see prices below USD 50 per barrel.
4333 2018-11-22 17:14:17 fun fact: both football teams traditionally playing today have connections to JFK assassination

clint murchison (texas oil billionaire supposedly hosted meeting with hoover, lbj, etc night before) used to own cowboys and fords (replaced jfk car windshield) still own the lions
4334 2018-11-22 17:14:16 As @monicamusonda pressure on the currency, in addition there are other factors in the economy at present ie liquidity, debt servicing etc. So the oil price may be lower but we won't see the price drop anytime soon.
4335 2018-11-22 17:14:06 Somalia needs money to build institutions. Oil and gas is only way to build a big revenue. Remember when Saudi started exploring oil and gas they didn't have experienced people. By the way, Somali people are everywhere and educated, its easy to find Somali lawyers today. US, EU,
4336 2018-11-22 17:14:04 #censortweet welcome to twitter censor sad .... and people worry about big oil
4337 2018-11-22 17:13:59 Thanksgiving cooking tip: 

When preparing kale  use plenty of oil in the pan. This is so it can easily slide out of the pan... into the garbage. 
4338 2018-11-22 17:13:58 Oil and filter change for $12.50?!!! I am so there!!! 
4339 2018-11-22 17:13:57 $old our integrity and morals for oil, contracts and, his interest...maga he says !!!
4340 2018-11-22 17:13:56 The FAKE 45 has and is pulling off the GREATEST, ELABORATE GRIFT,SCHEME, FLIM FLAM,BAMBOOZLING,CON,BACK STABBING,SWINDLING,SNAKE OIL SALES OF ALL TIME. Check how much trump inc has gained since being allowed access to the US Treasury?
4341 2018-11-22 17:13:53 Sooo... The price of oil is now murdered journalists... Gotcha...
4342 2018-11-22 17:13:44 Don’t forget to change your oil this winter
4343 2018-11-22 17:13:37 Mr.Trump what do you think the oil question
4344 2018-11-22 17:13:31 America sanctions slavery and president's climate warming climate denying oil +coal guzzling policies (and the trudeau govts.) are leading to planetary meltdown with survival of anyone not guaranteed. I am sick of fake news by lightweight radio stations which waste our time.HAND.
4345 2018-11-22 17:13:16 Can Trump salvage his belloved stock market? Has the Kashoggi leverage for lower oil price run out? Hurdles running out for Brexit? What blinding opportunities if any answer is yes
4346 2018-11-22 17:13:12 Argan oil is amazing for your skin, nails, and hair! It is made from a tree that withstands all kinds of harsh weather.
4347 2018-11-22 17:12:58 You had nothing to do with that. President Obama put into motion the plans for America to be less sufficient on oil imports. Thank You President Obama.
4348 2018-11-22 17:12:57 Saudi Arabia is not vital to our national security if they can buy our loyalty based on a business deal,and they only supply 11% of our oil compared to Canada’s 40% and they are far more of an ally and a better business partner.
4349 2018-11-22 17:12:56 Once again Trump using his gestapo Hitler's tactics in lying & saying that Saudi Arabia is keeping the oil prices down when we can actually export oil to Saudi Arabia where the biggest oil market in the world today Canada imports to the United States 40% wow sorry Arabia only 11%
4350 2018-11-22 17:12:52 How about you subsidize renewables until it’s there? Who is against that other than oil companies and lobbyists that have an interest in that not happening? They knew from the 70’s that climate change was man made. But they hid their findings. So yeah. Let’s protect them. 
4351 2018-11-22 17:12:51 Ask about the weirdest part, which is how they got the whale oil out. They would stretch the whale between two big arms, one of which would turn and wring the oil out of the whale, then throw it back in the sea, still alive but shaped like a corkscrew. #WhaleFacts
4352 2018-11-22 17:12:44 She should do @Shell_Nigeria and UK oil company a favour and stop investing.

Olodo women, sell there shares in NLNG should not be problem
4353 2018-11-22 17:12:44 Nasty and mean is not to care for human rights because of oil price. How mean and nasty is to call so many nations in middle East nasty and mean? For God sake they are people. You deal with Saudi Arabia's government who kills people and then you call middle East mean and nasty?

4355 2018-11-22 17:12:36 President Tom Riddle thanks Saudi Arabia for lowering US gas prices (WINK: in exchange for cheerleading their human rights abuses). EXCEPT: We get very little oil from Saudi Arabia. 70% comes from USA, CANADA, and LATIN AMERICA.
4356 2018-11-22 17:12:31 The US government has been sucking the oil out of OPECs dick for decades, yet now the Left 'lis pretending like it's all @realDonaldTrump's fault. Lol 
4357 2018-11-22 17:12:28 Deep fried, in an “oil less” fryer. 
4358 2018-11-22 17:12:28 Arent you aware of how this devastates the @oil_and_gas ? And layoffs?
4359 2018-11-22 17:12:23 Next time put a little olive oil in the syringe before you start.
4360 2018-11-22 17:12:13 Alberta's Heavy Oil Stream just "capitulated" this is when the Price Discovery in the market of Bid Price/Ask Price goes into free fall. The -33.%% drop overnight is setting up a Price War that shot its first ordinance across the bow. No one knows what comes next. Nov 22
4361 2018-11-22 17:12:10 We get more oil from our Canadian friends! Too bad you can't thank them.
4362 2018-11-22 17:12:10 I'm pretty sure the oil reserves will hold out another 15 years.
Probably another 50, given that we're likely to electrify basically all ground vehicles in the 2020s and 2030s.
Our fish production could go to literally zero and we'd be okay, food wise. We'd just have to eat soy.
4363 2018-11-22 17:12:10 Toast with virgin olive oil
4364 2018-11-22 17:12:06 Ah!i literally just fried some!you can season it however you want, i usually do black pepper but it works with whatever you like! Dont put it on too high a heat, and start it skin facing up --it will oil the pan. Recommend cutting it into small squares+flip w chopsticks or fork
4365 2018-11-22 17:12:01 god i'm so tired of this painting i'm doing now i've spent so much time on it and it's so far from done i don't have the attention span for big oil paintings
4366 2018-11-22 17:12:00 But will the Pakistani consumer feel the benefit of lower oil prices?  After all, we are also being supportive- not just the state but also parts of the media.
4367 2018-11-22 17:11:57 The world should turn their backs to Saudi Arabia. We only get 10% of our oil from them. We CAN LIVE WITHOUT MBS and Saudis. #Yemen #SaveTheChildren #JamalKhashoggi #Syria #TRE45ON #ImpeachTrump
4368 2018-11-22 17:11:54 @DavidLammy 

4 months to exit date.  “Eventually” is NOW..otherwise HIS plan...to leave and then hold me it you and all LP members conned.

Snake oil.

Maximum pressure NOW
4369 2018-11-22 17:11:52 I'm so confounded by the entire thing! Is the turkey still uncooked when you put it in the oil? If so, how long do you have to fry it before it's completely cooked? How does it not burn??! (In Belgium we mostly stick to frying fries, can you tell? :-D )
4370 2018-11-22 17:11:45 Whiskey
Fishing
Renewable energy
Tourism 

4 resources besides oil Scotland has that many other independent countries don’t have, yet manage to survive no bother.
When you take oil into consideration then why the fuck wouldn’t we be able to survive as an independent nation
4371 2018-11-22 17:11:40 “This is mink oil. I put it on my shoes and my skin.”
4372 2018-11-22 17:11:31 His flaw is not to explain it clearly and firmly to Canadians and to tell them it is even more important after the recent brawl between Saudi Arabia and Canada and the insane propaganda against Canada that KSA started. Canada should not depend on Saudi oil.
4373 2018-11-22 17:11:31 An allergic reaction to an essential oil? It must be karma.
4374 2018-11-22 17:11:29 Especially foreign oil and gas while unfairly punishing oil and gas sectors in Canada. Do these non Canadian suppliers hold up to the red tape as for Canadian oil?
4375 2018-11-22 17:11:22 Well on its way out? What metric are you using to measure that? Land mass? Oil revenues? I’d be interested to see the data you are using to make that assertion
4376 2018-11-22 17:11:22 Hi Nina, if you look at those studies, they are using "chow" that is either CRISCO or processed soy bean oil, highly toxic stuff and should not be considered a ketogenic diet.
4377 2018-11-22 17:11:20 $ECA encana is an overvalued company and oil is going down. Not hard to figure out it’s stock direction
4378 2018-11-22 17:11:16 If we punished Saudi Arabia for 9/11 their oil could've been ours anyway. Invaded the wrong country.
4379 2018-11-22 17:11:14 Its odd how Donald Trump is attacking Islam says their evil, while he cuddles up to Mohammed bin Salman/Saudi Arabia who has many FAUCETS of EVIL that they demonstrated, Yemen, Khashoggi, Wife beating. Oh wait Donald Trump and his friends have PERSONAL OIL DEALS and ARMS deals
4380 2018-11-22 17:11:08 Bernie is what a Democrat looks like after detoxing off that corporate blood money. Nobody taking a million dollars from oil & gas is gonna fight climate change DUH
4381 2018-11-22 17:11:07 This time, lordy there Are tapes.   Also, we get 4x more oil from Canada than we get from SA.  Along with Our production, we could do without their oil.  I just don’t understand why now SA is our protector.  But Trump knows if he says it, his supporters will eat it up.
4382 2018-11-22 17:10:57 How can we call Canada a democracy when this Trudeau Goverment controls everything. He tells you how to think & what to say. He shamelessly destroyed the oil industry and now will control the media. Is this democracy? We have an autocratic socialistic 3 rd World dictatorship!
4383 2018-11-22 17:10:54 I Have been informed that some Americans deep fry turkeys for Thanksgiving.

 Good luck with that, I guess

Oil burns aren't fun but you do you.
4384 2018-11-22 17:10:51 Al-Falih: "We will not sell oil that customers don't need"
"We will not make the market get anxious ... in the way it did in May or June, but at the same time we make it clear that it is not in anybody’s interest to create a glut similar to what we saw few years ago."
RTRS #OOTT
4385 2018-11-22 17:10:47 Turkey in the oil less fryer, bits and pieces in the pot boiling, onions n celery chopped up for the stuffing, spuds diced to make mashed spuds, pies cooked.
4386 2018-11-22 17:10:44 You never mean sorry.  You just supported an innocent mans slaughter and couldn’t give him the respect of hearing his last minutes of life by a barbaric man you kiss the rear off for cheap oil...... disgrace of a man you are no American you are welcomed by the devil.
4387 2018-11-22 17:10:44 Yeah but if you keep trying to drive the price of oil down, there will be less Big Oil as we find ourselves having to turn to more costly methods of E&P.  It's a lot of $$$ and at a low price we won't be able to afford it.  Funny how that works lol.
4388 2018-11-22 17:10:43 When OPEC meets in 14 days, cutting production and raising global prices within minutes, the president will have a choice: throw a tantrum; beg the Saudis to pump more oil again; keep the Iran waivers in place, defying his stated policy; or blame someone else.
4389 2018-11-22 17:10:35 $CL_F getting closer to 53.52 low, a break of this level would make it 5 swings down from yesterday's peak #Elliottwave #Oil #Trading
4390 2018-11-22 17:10:32 We get the majority of our oil from Canada idiot!
4391 2018-11-22 17:10:29 Low erucic rape or colza seeds *yielding a fixed oil which has an erucic acid content of < 2% and yielding a solid component of glucosinolates of < 30 micromoles/g*, whether or not broken (excl. for sowing) 0,39 €/kg  change -0,01%

4393 2018-11-22 17:10:19 チャーリーさん、どーしたんだろうな…
4394 2018-11-22 17:10:05 Only 11 percent of oil comes from Saudi Arabia while 40 percent comes  from Canada.
4395 2018-11-22 17:10:04 知ってる？大学って大して重要じゃないんだよ。焦ってる暇あったら油、飲も？
4396 2018-11-22 17:09:59 Already on it 
Also add to the list Extra Virgin Olive Oil & Balsamic Vinegar 
Priorities 
4397 2018-11-22 17:09:57 Ask him why he and Quebec oppose pipelines while tankers cruise up the St. Lawrence to sell us oil at $60 while we sell to US at $14. Ask him if this absurd situation could happen in any other country.Why is this not a bigger issue?
4398 2018-11-22 17:09:46 And what do you intend to ship said oil in?
4399 2018-11-22 17:09:44 Saudis said we will not get involved with U.S. politics , so we wont pump more oil. ...wait what?
4400 2018-11-22 17:09:37 You didn’t push hard stop lying.  You made a back deal with the Saudi’s to cover up a murder.  We are not dumb and we know the game you play. Oil is in abundance.  It will go back up in a few weeks.
4401 2018-11-22 17:09:28 Bell peppers sliced and put into a tray, drizzled and mixed with oil, kosher salt and pepper and put in the oven. It makes this delicious side dish!
4402 2018-11-22 17:09:25 So in court a murderer can point to low oil prices in mitigation?
4403 2018-11-22 17:09:17 Rosehip Oil but also Fresh’s Rose Mask. These two have done wonders on reducing the redness in my face.
4404 2018-11-22 17:09:08 Wala po stocks ng Luyang Dilaw Oil, yung 1 pc na natira dinekwat ko pa  Abang Abang baka sabado dumating ulit.

4405 2018-11-22 17:09:03 Mayo in potatoes is not a good idea. Try it with extra virgin olive oil or low fat butter & garlic.
4406 2018-11-22 17:09:02 nt sell-off
-U.S. dollar slips
-Crude oil rebounds from one-year lo
4407 2018-11-22 17:08:59 America not an Oil producing country but an Oil importing country, Dollar backed by overseas oil, what is there to loose? or what have been there that is lost?
4408 2018-11-22 17:08:57 ฟินมากๆๆค่ะพี่ออย ไม่อยากตื่นเลย555
4409 2018-11-22 17:08:55 But why is heating oil so high in NE? It's price is higher than gasoline despite a cheaper product and no highway taxes.  We need transparency on home heating oil speculation and how to make it a free market again.
4410 2018-11-22 17:08:50 Lower energy. 150 gallons home heating oil $404.67. I personally don't think that is low. Actually going to be a little tuff paying it.

4412 2018-11-22 17:08:48 Thank you Arlene, it's oil on canvas
4413 2018-11-22 17:08:47 If America actually fought just wars since the 40s maybe would we not be beholden to a bunch of “princes” because after freeing Saudi from Iraq (90) we would have taken the spoils of war (oil). Only Two reasons to fight wars and spill Americans blood - protection and treasure
4414 2018-11-22 17:08:46 Fact Check: You actually get way more of your oil from us.

You're welcome 
4415 2018-11-22 17:08:38 Hillary is way nicer. Trump is a moron. Rakes? And Canada supplies the US with oil not the Saudis from 9/11
4416 2018-11-22 17:08:35 It’s ok I do it to my dogs all the time
Coconut oil too
4417 2018-11-22 17:08:26 If low oil prices (Canada only getting 12 bucks a barrel) How are we getting cheaper gas prices when we are paying more for gas. Sounds like a Trudeau give me carbon tax and I'll give you more back in return.
4418 2018-11-22 17:08:25 @realDonaldTrump DICTATOR TRUMP, Fuck your oil prices! To get you out of office I pay 4 $ per gallon. And we're Broke. You are the most hated asshole in the world, Sooner or later you will have to answer to Our Justice System. We have Rules of Law, YOUR TIME is COMING. Jail? !!!!
4419 2018-11-22 17:08:22 .@CBCAlerts Also: while your observation is correct, Trump has a point as well. Oil prices are set by a global commodity market, not just who we buy from, and depending on when you look, Saudi Arabia is the number one source for crude oil (in 2017, Russia tied for first place.)
4420 2018-11-22 17:08:20 Trump's very dishonest about gas prices too, sucking up to Saudis and undermining the #IranDeal.  
Oil prices were lowest in decades under Obama, who also pulled support from Saudi war in #Yemen
4421 2018-11-22 17:08:18 @Cammy_Chapman loves to use his beard oil

4423 2018-11-22 17:08:12 @realDonaldTrump debts personal to @saudiarabia . USA only gets 9 percent of oil imports yet he is overtly nice. 40 percent from @Canada . The @GOP @GangOfPuppets will have some leave the flock soon.
4424 2018-11-22 17:07:53 £7.50 for durex lube lol. It’s probably stick to Johnson’s baby oil.
4425 2018-11-22 17:07:51 Depends on the point of view, legal or Islamic
4426 2018-11-22 17:07:50 Everyone winces at the thought of ancient pagan civilizations sacrificing people to their sun, rain, and crop gods. But no one bats an eye at the death of one U.S. journalist because oil prices.  

All praises to the gods of oil, war, and economy. /s
4427 2018-11-22 17:07:49 Trudeau did his job. He said that he wanted no pipelines and the oil will stay in the ground. So he took our hard earned tax$ bought a billion $ pipeline, made Kinder Morgan happy & now will make sure it stays empty! So be it! They destroyed the oil industry.Are you happy Canada?
4428 2018-11-22 17:07:47 You're mean and nasty buuuut how bout that oil? Lol
4429 2018-11-22 17:07:47 The decision was made for L. A. when the oil or auto (can't remember) companies bought the best public transit system of the day and dismantled it to force Angelenos onto the road in private cars. Support bought and paid for by oil co support for politicians and commissioners
4430 2018-11-22 17:07:46 It’s actually really good man. Not what you would think. You don’t batter it or anything, + the extra hot oil basically sears the entire outside of the turkey so it keeps all the moisture in while it’s cooking.

4434 2018-11-22 17:07:01 The US gets only 11% of our oil from the Saudis! We don't NEED their oil! But T wants their continuing deposits to his bank account. NOT for the US,  for himself!
4435 2018-11-22 17:06:59 We get 40%of our oil from Canada....11% from SA. How about giving Canada the credit instead of your murderous buds.
4436 2018-11-22 17:06:57 They do have a lot of oil, gas and mining interests up there
4437 2018-11-22 17:06:56 I’ve heard the U of U uses something similar to CBD oil, only it’s in more of a plant based form, has THC, and is illegal.
4438 2018-11-22 17:06:55 #LauraLoomer gets banned and @POTUS is going on with some shit about oil prices that I don't care about. Yes lower fuel prices are okay and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy for a second but they will go up again. A person silenced and 1st Amendment attacks can last forever.

4446 2018-11-22 17:06:12 Only stupid people would say that they have no choice, adding that we can not afford it by ourselves. There are many countries engage on oil exploration. One is Malaysia, another is Singapore which manufactures oil rigs and sent it all the way to the north sea or middle east.
4447 2018-11-22 17:06:10 You're utterly clueless about how sinking oil prices HURT domestic oil production and oilfield jobs. You're also clueless about the harm being done to U.S. farmers & other U.S. industries. 25th AMENDMENT NOW.
4448 2018-11-22 17:06:08 Now you want to take credit for lower gas prices. Price of crude oil lowers prices. The only thing you have in common with that is that you are also crude.
4449 2018-11-22 17:06:06 @SenSchumer correct me if I am wrong... shouldn't we be thanking @Canada?  We do get 40% of our petroleum products/oil from them..

4453 2018-11-22 17:05:29 #UKIGF18 Intelligent address as ever by David Souter, but surely we were, and are, wrong about Internet "disappearing"; forget all these analogies with oil or electricity; just simplistic.
4454 2018-11-22 17:05:24 He has taken bribes from the Saudi's and protected them from any actions for murdering an American Journalist.  He has started to ruin the economy driving down demand for oil. He has increased debt so we can't afford oil. He has rolled back EPA regulations.
4455 2018-11-22 17:05:22 1. Defending Saudi Arabia strongly suggests you have a personal stake in the relationship.
2. We get only 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.
3. You’re comparing unrelated prices.
4. We should be phasing out oil in favor of renewable resources, like the rest of the world. New jobs!
4456 2018-11-22 17:05:17 Yep. It’s not breaded but they literally drop a whole turkey in a vat of oil. Very dangerous but worth it
4457 2018-11-22 17:05:15 Drilling rigs are nothing to do with fracking. They just drill the hole then leave. They also drill for geothermal, coal bed methane, oil, gas and other things.
4458 2018-11-22 17:05:08 The fuel  , energy , food  is agreed and decided by politicians . Technology is there , you dont need oil. You need multi year lead times , because you need equipment- you cant 3d print everything /yet.

4462 2018-11-22 17:04:32 Over 40 Percent of our oil comes from Canada, Saudi less than 20 percent. We arent dependent on them. They need us to sort out Iran. MBS is highly unstable. Saudi Arabia needs a better leader so we can have a more reliable ally.

4466 2018-11-22 17:04:08 Can't understand why anyone would hate a guy who just sold out our country's integrity and moral high ground to support a murderous dictator like MBS. Let me guess... He's a Muslim that you like, right? The Orange Turd doesn't even know that we only get 11% of imp oil from SA.
4467 2018-11-22 17:03:55 Oil prices are down because CANADA has a stockpile and is selling to US cheaply, Saudi needs US more than we need them. 
Pompeo is another power hungry blob who works for his own interests (power and position) NOT those of US!

OH YEAH -- Because we only get 11% of our oil from Saudi. 

But 11% is all that you needed to lie some more -- OH - and to CONDONE THE MURDER OF A JOURNALIST.

4479 2018-11-22 17:02:43 These protests are most likely orchestrated by oil billionaires. Any idea how much gasoline will cost if there is no oil left? #idiots
4480 2018-11-22 17:02:42 Everything Donald Trump says is a lie. Which means that the Crown Prince does NOT regret Khashoggi’s death and he, not the “world” is to blame. The CIA DID conclude that MBS was responsible, and lastly it’s not oil prices, but rather Saudi bribes to Trump that prevent punishment.
4481 2018-11-22 17:02:40 It's not just Trump. The USA sold it's soul eons ago. We are the most feared assassins - the largest purveyors of violence  - and greed - in the world. If any country has oil and/or precious metals - they better watch out! Trump didn't start this. Morality? Come on.

4486 2018-11-22 17:02:34 Foods like avocado, walnuts, and 100% extra virgin olive oil are rich sources of healthy fats that can hydrate your skin from the inside-out.
4487 2018-11-22 17:02:31 It’s pretty repulsive and disgusting that Trump has tweeted his admiration for lower gas prices thanks to Saudi Arabia, after Saudi Arabia murdered a journalist. Blood is thicker than water, but to Trump oil is more valuable than life.

4501 2018-11-22 17:01:49 Saudi Arabia is currently our 22nd largest goods trading partner with $35.2 billion in total (two way) goods trade during 2017. Goods exports totaled $16.3 billion; goods imports totaled $18.9 billion. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Saudi Arabia was $2.5 billion 20%oil 
4502 2018-11-22 17:01:41 There's a store locally that grows and makes their own CBD oil, which was originally intended for their son.... whow lived with Epilepsy. Been all but seizure free for years now.
4503 2018-11-22 17:01:40 Hey the oil price is down $7 since OPEC+ announced they're cutting production in December.  He'll just roll with it.  In the words of Bear Bryant, run that play until they get it right!
As for shale being happy about it, that ultimately will stop the tweets at some point.
4504 2018-11-22 17:01:36 Trump and his administration apparently have no clue how much oil the US imports from Saudi Arabia...15 %.  40 % from Canada It's the billions of $ in arms sales they would lose. Weapons =jobs in the US. Weapons = huge profits. So the US can't lose this market to China or Russia.

these money belong to niger delta people as they are not selfish about the oil so therefore the money have to spread too.
4513 2018-11-22 17:00:59 I find it ironic while you bow down to these people your supporters see nothing wrong - they were among the first to bash Obama for ONLY bowing as is the customary greeting in some countries.

4514 2018-11-22 17:00:57 Researchers in Japan found that study participants who consumed linseed oil enriched with dia-cil-glycerol experienced higher fat oxidation than after consuming regular linseed oil, suggesting that the modified linseed oil may be beneficial to combat obesity.

4517 2018-11-22 17:00:41 The price of oil does not hinge solely on Saudi Arabia as America is very close to self sufficient on oil production.

4520 2018-11-22 17:00:39 And if there was an export pipeline to tidewater, the oil could go to (in theory) any customer willing to pay the most for it. We appear to be the only country where the federal government is content to allow a situation where oil is produced for export at a loss.

4543 2018-11-22 16:59:28 And yet 9/11 didn't deter previous leadership from working with this country? Or previous leaders bowing..Seems oil and strategic war positions goes a long way toward turning the blind eye. This sudden righteous indignation is "woke"
4544 2018-11-22 16:59:25 Maybe the chemical industry is more useful analogy in this case. During WWI, GB cut exports of nitrates (crucial to producing explosives/gunpowder) to GER. In response, GER's chemical industry innovated new methods for synthetic nitrates. Also oil is probably still the new oil.
4545 2018-11-22 16:59:24 American consumers could simply stop buying byproducts from Saudi and Iranian oil, processed and presented as imported Chinese goods, marketed and purchased in the U.S.A.

4560 2018-11-22 16:57:58 Welp, there went my Thanksgiving plans. Blazer started hemorrhaging oil shortly after the gf and I left the house. Noticed there was no oil pressure and turned around. Made it back home, thankfully.
4561 2018-11-22 16:57:52 Not only has  failed to deliver on sanctions relief, now he’s urging lower oil prices. Vladimir Vladimirovich must not be happy.
4562 2018-11-22 16:57:52 Yes! The game is all about these kinds of trade-offs. We'd have to do some work on our liquid-management interface as it's quite clunky right now. Ex. people need to be able to consolidate oil across multiple partial containers. Once we fix that it opens up new possibilities.
4563 2018-11-22 16:57:45 Those natives really know how to treat snake oil selling salesmen
4564 2018-11-22 16:57:45 Using isis to implement laws of control they will never get rid of They want you to be scared of them so we keep letting them fund a false war against them when realy we just destroying the east for oil gains and gold Egypt Lybia Syria these country's fucked now#westernliberation
4565 2018-11-22 16:57:34 also need a deep condition and hot oil treatment.

4567 2018-11-22 16:57:29 Pigs in blankets will never be abolished  great stuff on the palm oil though 
4568 2018-11-22 16:57:27 Our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and shield our customers from dramatic price increases. Thanks - Leah 2/2
4569 2018-11-22 16:57:17 Dilute it first so it won’t burn but tea tree oil will help clear that
4570 2018-11-22 16:57:11 A pea-sized amount of baby oil can act as a shine hair serum before dashing out the door.
4571 2018-11-22 16:57:10 And CBD oil!
4572 2018-11-22 16:56:59 Quite literally blood for oil - you are sickening
4573 2018-11-22 16:56:53 Except reality..Saudi Arabia does not impact oil prices.Most of our imported oil is from Canada. Not to mention...its phucking murder & this mofo is dwelling in our White House selling us all out 4 personal gain & making the world a more dangerous place by coddling these killers
4574 2018-11-22 16:56:48 As Trump would say- don’t be a baby. The President just made a tough call. Look naive on the world stage or risk skyrocketing oil prices that could cause a world wide recession. Hopefully your wallet is thanking him even if you aren’t.
4575 2018-11-22 16:56:47 Well a Zippo could be re-filled, but only with accelerant, but not lamp oil....for example. That could be an interesting game mechanic of making choices. Thanks for the answer! Greets from Germany.
4576 2018-11-22 16:56:46 Same old problem. The majority of voters East of Saskatchewan don’t give a shit what impact Liberal policy has on the oil and gas sector....or the lives of Canadians living west of their home province for that matter.
4577 2018-11-22 16:56:41 Expose all the lies tell us the TRUTH about the War for Oil and how ISIS was really created.
4578 2018-11-22 16:56:41 India has a unique position where inflation cannot happen in food&essentials but mostly in imports esp oil. Oil is a major problem as it can translate to essentials as indirect inflation.
Govt should step in & reduce/control oil or a way to move away or translate using own INR.

4584 2018-11-22 16:56:13 I am glad Mitt can afford to pay whatever the price for gasoline. I and many others are grateful Trump is working with the Saudis to keep oil prices down.
4585 2018-11-22 16:56:11 .@realDonaldTrump If you so concerned with oil prices and brag about your relationship with Saudi Arabia for today's low fuel prices when in fact it only contributes to 11% of our needs, why do you treat Canada and Venezuela so poorly when most of our imports are from them.

4590 2018-11-22 16:55:54 Sorry to sound like a total arsehole, and I’m very sorry for the situation you are in, but please don’t waste money on snake oil like homeopathy. It simply doesn’t work.

4596 2018-11-22 16:55:24 You did not push gas prices “so low” ...stop lying!!! The market regulates oil prices not you ...what a disgraced of leader you are, lying constantly to your followers, who you know are mostly uneducated and won’t know better than your lies...sad ...

4603 2018-11-22 16:55:07 kl di klaimnya kleveru sih ada oil yang bisa tapi gatau juga blm pernah coba
4604 2018-11-22 16:55:04 The Trudeau government has invested $4 billion of taxpayer money in a pipeline and is committed to seeing it built. That money came from taxpayers across the country. I support it. The government has no control over the price of oil.
4605 2018-11-22 16:55:04 Not every newspaper has an American hedge fund behind it to promote big oil and American style capitalism.
4606 2018-11-22 16:55:03 i cant even imagine how many prominent voices that oil money can buy.
4607 2018-11-22 16:54:54 You have to stop watching Fox. You are not the person responsible for lower gas prices. You do not have the power or ability to influence oil prices. America is the largest producer of oil, not Donald Trump.
4608 2018-11-22 16:54:49 @realDonaldTrump If you so concerned with oil prices and brag about your relationship with Saudi Arabia for today's low fuel prices when in fact it only contributes to 11% of our needs, why do you treat Canada and Venezuela so poorly when most of our imports are from them.
4609 2018-11-22 16:54:42 So why does this #Lieberal government try to keep Canadian subsistence on Saudi Arabian oil? I'm still old enough to remember the SS Arrow running aground off NS, and the oil is still leaking out almost 50 years later.
4610 2018-11-22 16:54:35 Oh see i do the oil
4611 2018-11-22 16:54:34 Your timeline is such a rollercoaster of emotions towards the Oil. I love it.

4615 2018-11-22 16:54:30 What happened to PUTTING AMERICA FIRST? You are putting Saudi Arabia before USA. Big Oil is in North Dakota, Texas, Cali, NM, etc. PUT AMERCA FIRST. THERE ARE BORDERS BETWEEN USA AND SAUDI ARABIA. What happened to MAGA?
4616 2018-11-22 16:54:29 There's butter base, oil base, Bailey's Chocolate cake, microwave chocolate cake, chocolate chips cake and so much more!
4617 2018-11-22 16:54:22 Birds and oil. Been hearing about it for decades. NEVER gets old, CBC, never gets old. One single drop? Well I'm convinced now. How do we get started in impoverishing Canada because of it. I'm all in! You've turned the guilt you've provided us into demoralized 'happiness'. Thanks
4618 2018-11-22 16:54:12 Never too early. Start with some good olive oil and bread to coat/absorb.

4620 2018-11-22 16:54:11 Mark, for hydro, wind and solar, Primary Energy, using @IEA's definition, is just their electrical output. For coal, gas, nuclear and oil it is the energy content of their fuel - of which 67% goes up the chimney as thermal waste. Did you really not know that?
4621 2018-11-22 16:54:10 Oil, money! Killing people for oil and money and using American military to line the pockets of you rich bastards that what it's all about...keep the Middle East unstable, it's great for business! Who cares how many die!

4623 2018-11-22 16:53:55 "By the end of 2019, total U.S. oil production -- including so-called natural gas liquids used in the petrochemical industry -- is expected to rise to 17.4 million barrels a day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At that level, American net imports of...
4624 2018-11-22 16:53:47 Wake up ALBERTA. JT hates Oil & he hates the West more. Always has, always will. 
S E P A R A T E!
4625 2018-11-22 16:53:41 Isn't OPEC cutting production to keep prices up? And isn't Canada our largest supplier of international oil imports? Also, Crude Oil futures havent been over $80 since 2014.
4626 2018-11-22 16:53:38 The grinch steals hanukkah by making sure the oil lasts one night
4627 2018-11-22 16:53:25 SCS is not the same as SLS.  They are made the same way, by treating fatty acids with sulphuric acid and then neutralising with an alkali.  The difference between them is that SLS is made using purified and isolated Lauric acid, whereas SCS is made using whole Coconut oil.
4628 2018-11-22 16:53:25 The labatt oil cans are out. This is gonna end poorly
4629 2018-11-22 16:53:18 Thermonuclear yikes.
Not sure yet. The wiring harnesses on these engines like to fill with oil so... gotta peek
4630 2018-11-22 16:53:10 More lies! Saudi oil has very little effect on the USA. Saudi deals would benefit Trumps way into future!
4631 2018-11-22 16:53:08 Fairly similar distillates in Refining of crude oil.
The pricing differential we had for decades was an anomaly due to Diesel being subsidized.
In a free market economy sans subsidies petrol is just marginally more expensive than Diesel.

4634 2018-11-22 16:52:46 We the people thank you for standing up for our country and for democracy.   When the president of the U.S. thanks the Saudi's for OIL while exonerating them for murder then our democracy is under assault.  Some day those munitions that the Saudi's buy may be used on us.
4635 2018-11-22 16:52:41 Do you mean to tell me that the president of the united states is caping for a murderous regime in order to protect weapon and oil sales? This is a very upsetting revelation as I've never read the news at any point in the last 50 years.
4636 2018-11-22 16:52:39 That oil had me on my ass last night

4639 2018-11-22 16:52:27 An even more important discussion would be about the unsustainably growing human population that ultimately drives deforestation including for palm oil, but nobody wants to get into that one.  Easier to jump on smaller bandwagons.
4640 2018-11-22 16:52:27 It is my thought Trump is threating Bull Shit.  We get 40 % of our oil from Canada. 10% from Saudi. We could buy oil from Venezuela cuz they've been sanction. Our own Oil Corp if they didn't jack up the $. Trump is terrible before, now and future.
4641 2018-11-22 16:52:25 Teatree oil!! Cats absolutley hate it (tho you might too it smells bad)
4642 2018-11-22 16:52:24 Not sure we are as dependent on Saudi oil as trump likes us to be.
4643 2018-11-22 16:52:24 ...Or they are in the pockets of oil companies
4644 2018-11-22 16:52:23 Still can’t believe my manager at firehouse told me he listened to a whole podcast about olive oil. 
4645 2018-11-22 16:52:21 Can someone point out where all this growth in the economy is coming from. Oil has hit rock bottom in the west, Bombardier lay off, financial institutions say money leaving Canada. Is it smoke and mirrors, just government created jobs that aren’t sustainable?
4646 2018-11-22 16:52:18 Waiting for my local oil delivery guy to lower his price. Same as a month ago. Let others buy his expensive stock first.

4648 2018-11-22 16:52:11 When the economy should be booming here with the average oil prices. You have numbers and figures but you have no life experience.  Sorry. Stay home and read another book while alberta suffers. Tweak your numbers and figures to make your liberal government look good.

4650 2018-11-22 16:52:01 Well.. here in Venezuela we had it...

That used tiene be among the first worlwide...
4651 2018-11-22 16:51:49 If the Quakers want to boycott Israel. Then for consistency boycott petrol & other oil based products from Saudi. Chinese goods for Tibet occupation human rights etc...and so on
4652 2018-11-22 16:51:41 Because the Shah fell, he was our ally and the new government took hostages and called us the great satan.  And the fact that they were sitting on the largest amount of proven cheap oil, and desperately needed friends because they didn't have the people to keep it.
4653 2018-11-22 16:51:39 Does he not understand what low prices do to the Oil and Gas Industry in the USA?
4654 2018-11-22 16:51:33 Pretty sure gun oil is not exactly food-safe
4655 2018-11-22 16:51:32 Maybe we should turn the oil stream off! Let them figure out how to power the east!

4659 2018-11-22 16:51:19 Certainly, SCS is made using whole Coconut oil and has a greater molecular mass and more complex molecular structure than SLS.  This prevents it from penetrating the epidermis, and means that it has far less irritancy as it cannot reach the cells under the skin surface.
4660 2018-11-22 16:51:15 Olive oil as annoiting oil...You are good to go

4663 2018-11-22 16:51:02 Dear Kimberly: Just made vegan, gluten-free almond butter choc-chip cookies. WOW! Absolute best EVER. The secret? Substitute almond meal for flour and flax seed meal + water for eggs. Coconut oil instead of butter, coconut sugar. Line pan w/parchment paper. Today I try brownies!
4664 2018-11-22 16:51:02 Lol we buy most of our oil from Canada? You're delusional.
4665 2018-11-22 16:51:02 Now playing Midnight Oil - The Dead Heart on Movie Scores and More Radio
4666 2018-11-22 16:51:01 Remember when you thought she was bad for pushing a windfall profit tax on oil companies?
4667 2018-11-22 16:51:00 Saudi Arabia counts as 9% of our imported oil - Canada 40% - maybe we should be working with Canada instead of Saudi Arabia!
4668 2018-11-22 16:50:58 เอาเลยยย ไปสั่งแปปป
4669 2018-11-22 16:50:53 But everyone who told me bush wasn’t their president said it was all about oil.
4670 2018-11-22 16:50:47 I'm in the mood for roasted yam with peppered red oil and onions
4671 2018-11-22 16:50:40 We get more oil from Nigeria than we do from Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia is only crucial to your personal national security.
4672 2018-11-22 16:50:31 Then again Petrol prices were high because Crude oil prices were high. I pay 2.79 dollars for premium in Australia when I was there. Now they are continuously reducing it since last 20 days.
4673 2018-11-22 16:50:16 เสื้อเหลืองก็มา ตัว500จ่ะ เกลียกดดดดด
4674 2018-11-22 16:50:13 Gas prices are at a 4 year high. We only get 11% of our oil from the Saudis - we don't need their oil. Finally, putting a price on a human life is disgusting & unforgivable. You as always, are the consummate liar. If the truth passed your lips it would probably kill you.
4675 2018-11-22 16:50:07 Husky reported no visible “rainbowing” as the oil was too dispersed before surface. Isolated incidents for sure. But to put it in oil spill context it is 1,572 bbls. Tragic and should not have happened. Just providing barrels for comparison to other spills
4676 2018-11-22 16:50:03 Oil corporations pay for GOP political campaigns they don't do it for$40 oil they do it for $140+oil the last thing the oil corporations wanted was Iran's cheap to produce conventional oil flooding the oil market- same reason a halliburton executive and W the oil man invaded Iraq
4677 2018-11-22 16:50:02 En helemaal maf: rookloze cannabisvarianten (wax, oil, etc, die in Amerika zo'n  beetje de helft van de omzet maken) zijn in de coffeeshop *verboden*.
4678 2018-11-22 16:50:01 What happened to PUTTING AMERICA FIRST? You are putting Saudi Arabia before USA. Big Oil is in North Dakota, Texas, Cali, NM, etc. PUT AMERCA FIRST. THERE IS ARE BORDERS BETWEEN USA AND SAUDI ARABIA. What happened to MAGA?
4679 2018-11-22 16:49:36 Yasir is from the word Yusr meaning Ease.
Yasir means me saukakawa.
He's found to always observe ease & simplicity in his affairs, ba kakale ba iyayi.
He's supposed to be gentle & kind wajen interaction with mutane.
He brings about ease(solution) to all problems set before him

4681 2018-11-22 16:49:28 @LTZONDA if your car is drinking oil..... I would look at the oil level sensor or any leaks under the car... could be something simple but just seems weird to be drinking oil
4682 2018-11-22 16:49:23 The reason oil prices are low is because the oil-rich nations in the Middle East, led by Saudi Arabia, want to put as many North American oil companies, which were on the rise, out of business -- squeezing their profits. They aren't an ally.
4683 2018-11-22 16:49:23 Is your thanks to the Saudis for lower oil prices cover for their horrible crime of murder?
4684 2018-11-22 16:49:17 With your 600 million of our taxpayer money we can expect more media propaganda  to decimate the oil sands.
4685 2018-11-22 16:49:12 โอเคค่า
4686 2018-11-22 16:49:11 Cheap oil is no solution for human rights violations and murder.  So glad I don't own a car and if I ever do it would be electric.
4687 2018-11-22 16:49:11 We're going to work on the whole oil deal now. Get your info ready. My media likes to have laptops and surface pros on holidays...
4688 2018-11-22 16:49:04 僕を酸化させたらダメだよ。オイルにとって酸化は命取り。…僕を見守っててね⁇
4689 2018-11-22 16:48:59 The weirdest tweet ever by a President. But truly he manipulated the oil market, congrats on the cheap gas, bigger SUVs, smog and yes traffic jams. Oh, and bankrupt frackers.
4690 2018-11-22 16:48:57 Rather than oil, nuclear power is both low carbon and limitless. A better option?
4691 2018-11-22 16:48:38 If you equate oil with someone’s life you lose
4692 2018-11-22 16:48:37 I don't care about MB Khashoggi...but apparently DEMs r using it to drive a wedge between US and SA which will lead to incr oil prices...which in turn will lead to downturn in economy...it's another DEMe plan to destroy Trump in 2020...I do care about that...#MAGA...
4693 2018-11-22 16:48:31 Girl, women uniting over @SPANX leggings and rose hip oil has been amazing!!
4694 2018-11-22 16:48:29 A barrel is now $54.55 for America's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil.
However, the price of Brent currently is $63.28. Since majority of India's oil import is based on Brent price, India would not benefit this month much from WTI price dip.

4695 2018-11-22 16:48:28 Those playoff series were always the best ones to watch. I always thought that Dallas didn't win more Cups in that era because they had to get through the Oil every year and were just spent after those series. Good, fiesty hockey between teams that legit didn't like each other.
4696 2018-11-22 16:48:25 This so called reporter still refers to this project as Kinder Morgan’s! Is this fact or disinformation? Will this pathetic group called NEB be referring to this crap as dilbit and not oil. I like many others would like evidence that this  can actually be removed .
4697 2018-11-22 16:48:22 So does Canada control the price/market for oil? I mean if we SA Raised the price, would Canada keep it bellow?
4698 2018-11-22 16:48:09 America is no longer America. Now it's just 'merica. A desolate wasteland of gas fracking and oil wells and mines. Our national parks are gone, exploited for mineral rights.
4699 2018-11-22 16:48:06 Ah, it contains very little oil anyway, thanks and a few filler words for good measure.
4700 2018-11-22 16:48:01 I have oil heat as well. Gas heat scares me too. I’ll pray it gets fixed soon.

4702 2018-11-22 16:47:56 Some1 over at the pos Pooh-bahs. Heard 'em talkin' to the parasite while I was siphoning more fuel oil so I can barely survive while they thrive off proceeds from organized crime/my family's suffering, exploited lives & deaths/MURDERS! @GenFlynn @BrettKavanaugh @MattWhitaker46
4703 2018-11-22 16:47:52 Boycott Saudi. Don't sell them arms, food. Don't buy their oil. That is what a Civil World should be doing
4704 2018-11-22 16:47:50 The environmentalists also argued that new oil activities in the fragile Arctic region would be contrary to the 2016 Paris climate accord, which seeks to limit average global warming to under two degrees Celsius.
4705 2018-11-22 16:47:48 That whole press conference was crazy! So many lies. The firehose turned on full blast. Economy was teetering when he was elected. Oil prices were going up to 100 2 weeks ago & we were going to be paying double & triple at the pump if it weren’t for he & the Saudis.
4706 2018-11-22 16:47:41 First, cleanse, ALWAYS. If you're like me, kind of lazy, you can go for a light cleanser and only do it once, but if you're really in to it, and want bigger and better results faster, double cleanse: First, with an oil cleanser, second with a foaming cleanser
4707 2018-11-22 16:47:39 So what you are saying, I want to hurt the American oil field workers so that the ones that have not found a job never will. Unemployment doesn’t count for those not on unemployment because they have exceeded the time limit.  Thanks, my husband may never work again.
4708 2018-11-22 16:47:36 In the last recession we had:
- room for BoC to stimulate (interest rate was 5%; 1.75% now)
- balanced budget at the onset of the recession
- strong oil & gas sector, which acted as employer of last resort to tens of thousands
- a competent PM

We have none of this now.

4711 2018-11-22 16:47:30 Well a government created that favourable environment, and even with such good environment. Gowon or OBJ could have still rejected to give licence.

Did the oil coy come with the crude oil like the telecoms came with the GSM technology? You supposed dey think b4 you tweet...
4712 2018-11-22 16:47:30 Perhaps the government thinks oil tastes better
4713 2018-11-22 16:47:30 The groups Greenpeace, Natur og Ungdom (Nature and Youth) and the Grandparents Climate Campaign had accused Norway, western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer, of violating a new article of the country’s constitution that guarantees since 2014 right to a healthy environment.
4714 2018-11-22 16:47:27 You forgot to mention, oil prices will skyrocket after the holidays

4717 2018-11-22 16:47:15 All Roberts has to do now is drop the price of oil and all is forgiven....
4718 2018-11-22 16:47:13 Oh yeah!

In 2008 even a person with #Mercedes #BMW #Audi bought LPG at subsidized rates.

Oil firms added 7 crore LPG customers between April 2015 and December 2017, expanding the active customer base by about 50%.

4719 2018-11-22 16:47:00 "Do you remember what a logic given by Norwegian Court while dismissing Environmental Case?" 5th January, 2018, OSLO: A Norwegian court on Thursday dismissed a case by three environmentalist groups which had sued Norway for granting oil licences in the Arctic.

4722 2018-11-22 16:46:43 This contains several incorrect statements:
Germany declared war against us after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor
Saddam was captured, tried and hung
Bin Laden was shelved while we invaded Iraq, for oil, Killed 15 yrs later

Back to school, Ed.....(last parts right)
4723 2018-11-22 16:46:40 What does your master Putin think about this? He will not be happy with low oil prices
4724 2018-11-22 16:46:38 Every monetary decision that Trump makes for this country is about him. When he says that something will be good for America's bottom line is that is will make him money. Thus the rhetoric about the Saudi's and oil.
4725 2018-11-22 16:46:32 Glad Hasan Siber is pitching @COlive_oil at @Startups4Peace. Interesting. Stressing transparency and collaboration.  6000 tons of olive oil exported from Cyprus each year. #Room4Growth
4726 2018-11-22 16:46:29 Trump thanks Saudi Arabia for lower oil prices...

KINGDOM:  Crown prince a 'red line' in Khashoggi probe...

CIA tape reveals instructions to 'silence'?
4727 2018-11-22 16:46:28 Uh, so your god is ok with murdering someone or starving millions of children to death in Yemen if you can sell the country doing the killing arms or buy oil from them? That’s a policy. 

What did your god say about helping the poor or immigrants?

4731 2018-11-22 16:46:08 We sell 'em guns and buy their oil. But this Trump guy said....
4732 2018-11-22 16:45:58 “Big Oil”? All about the $ with you...SAD. You put $ before life . You make a statement that ends in “big Oil”..... SO SAD FOR USA . You MALBA (Make America Look Bad Again).
4733 2018-11-22 16:45:56 Both stores closed. They have gas heat. I have oil heat & when there's a problem, call my oil company who are available 24/7, 365 days. They service the boiler once a year. Electrician said he would try to get it going temporarily. It scares me.
4734 2018-11-22 16:45:56 Oil heater under the desk is a great idea until it tips over and clobbers your knee
4735 2018-11-22 16:45:51 Omg no but I would change my oil to that one
4736 2018-11-22 16:45:51 I need a oil change !
4737 2018-11-22 16:45:49 Don’t do butter unless it’s clarified butter, if you blanch make sure you dry them very well before they hit the oil

4739 2018-11-22 16:45:42 My dog is epileptic so I feel your pain. They’re horrifying. If you’re concerned about it happening again, you should get some CDB oil. Spray it in their mouths and it can stop it or cut it much shorter.
4740 2018-11-22 16:45:41 I think it's an interesting idea. I'd like to know what benefit Alberta has from holding the land as is.
Not sure I'd call all Crown land unproductive. Does it have oil leases, forestry, rich ecology, habitat for endangered species? Or is it pretty low functioning now.
4741 2018-11-22 16:45:40 Saudi Arabia only accounts for 11% of our oil  imports.... 
now I know why trump wants to rid America of science....mathematics is the science to everything in life and his math sucks....
4742 2018-11-22 16:45:35 กูก็ไม่เคยไประรานชีวิตมึงขนาดนั้นนะ?แล้วทำไมมึงถึงชอบทำ??
4743 2018-11-22 16:45:31 Any simulation of the oil market will show that a swing producer trims extreme volatility and on average, &  loweres long term oil prices.  
Irony: it was low volatility that expanded oil demand in late 1800s and after 1930s
4744 2018-11-22 16:45:26 Please patronize my sister also retweet her customer might be on your  TL. Unrefined groundnut oil has no cholesterol and its very good for  your heart.
4745 2018-11-22 16:45:21 Do you know we get 4x as much oil from Canada as from Saudi? And he insults them, and do you say boo? Google "U.S. Oil Imports by Country of Origin "

He's not looking for blood money for America, he is looking for $$ into his own personal pocket. The oil price is just his con
4746 2018-11-22 16:45:09 Seriously? What country did anyone put Trump over? The Salman family has been in reign since like the 80s. Pence already said he should be taken out of power. They literally run the world oil economy. If Trump made a move that drove us back to 70s rations you'd blow a gasket
4747 2018-11-22 16:45:06 Not really, Because you don't want lose, what if you punished Saudi Arabia will not sell oil or increase price.
4748 2018-11-22 16:45:00 Headline in today's Kansas City Star "Trump thanks Saudis for falling oil.prices". We have all gone mad.
4749 2018-11-22 16:44:50 Well that's what happens when you make deals with murderers and men who hide behind assassin's for deals on hotel's and oil, isn't it?
4750 2018-11-22 16:44:50 maybe the kashoggia’s is to blame for His death.
Oil talk
4751 2018-11-22 16:44:49 True or false donnie. 40% of imported oil comes from Canada while Saudi Arabia provides just 11%?

4755 2018-11-22 16:44:29 You don't think it inappropriate for a POTUS to talk about trade in a Thanksgiving message to a serving officer who is away from his home and family? 
(As for oil, ask yourself why is US not investing in alternative energy sources?)
4756 2018-11-22 16:44:16 The poor man solution to Canadian oil problem, Ottawa is the only 1 to not understand!!
4757 2018-11-22 16:44:14 Trump will question whether or not the tribe actually killed him. Then thank them the next day for low oil costs. Claiming it all under his 'MErica First stance
4758 2018-11-22 16:44:11 But the problem is that Indian Oil marketing companies are fast to increase but slow in decreasing . We are a logistics company and I fail to understand why there is not a transparent system
4759 2018-11-22 16:44:02 #USmarkets are closed for the Thanksgiving Day holiday.#GBP rallied more than 1%, buoyed by positive developments in #Brexit negotiations. #Oil prices sank back towards their lowest level in more than a year, amid signs of swelling U.S. inventories. Indian Mkt closed tomorrow
4760 2018-11-22 16:43:56 No doubt the Golan Heights belongs to Syria.   It's in Syria!  Israel and Cheney And friends continue to pirate Syria's oil!  Dreadful
4761 2018-11-22 16:43:50 And it ended a little over a year after it started. Why are we getting 2001 prices for our oil! Who is paying 17 year old prices for anything?
4762 2018-11-22 16:43:44 No Dan, let’s set aside the tin foil hat for a moment and look at facts.  Tides is an international philanthropic organization investing in positive environmental initiatives.  Oil barons are gleeful that some people are gullible enough to see them as victims
4763 2018-11-22 16:43:43 To Bomb Saudi Arabia and take their oil is the American way

4766 2018-11-22 16:43:30 Come on big oil will NEVER take responsibility for its own actions that lead to massive failures and ecological damage. Will always blame someone far down the corporate food chain and unforseen circumstances.
No Arctic Drilling.

4768 2018-11-22 16:43:21 On this Thanksgiving Day Trump reveals how unglued he really is with his lie filled military address.  He now claims he's kept oil prices so low that he's been blamed for traffic jams! Holy moly #NutJobInChief.

4769 2018-11-22 16:43:21 Perceptions is THE major force driving oil futures prices.
4770 2018-11-22 16:43:19 Cheap oil from Venezuela and Saudi = good. Cheap lumber from the northern menace = bad
4771 2018-11-22 16:43:16 people from the office asked us kung kaya ang baklasan within 3 days (manoeuvring, oil transfer, overhauling, boxing up, testing, etc.), as if naman May magagawa kami. Kung gustohin man nila ipagawa eh mukhang wala naman kami choice eh
4772 2018-11-22 16:43:15 Maybe they'll flood the market with cheaper oil if he covers up more murders for their royal family.
4773 2018-11-22 16:43:13 “...You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows. Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.” Psalms 23 5b-6. I am so incredibly blessed and have so much to be thankful for. I truly lack nothing.
4774 2018-11-22 16:43:10 Oil prices aren’t low because Saudi Arabia murdered Khashoggi. They’re low because there’s a global fear of recession
4775 2018-11-22 16:43:09 You liar the oil industry has slumped because your mishandling my wages are lower since being unemployed no free hansouts since I'm self emoyed unlike the $ your #government is handing out to #illegal #immigrants

4776 2018-11-22 16:43:07 they had a lot of flaky, dry skin on em, and while coconut oil rubs it off in little rolls anyway, my boss suggested giving them a warm wash and gentle scrub as well.
4777 2018-11-22 16:43:03 No the Saudi's are not vital to us. They are directly responsible for 9/11 they are murderers. Oh & you may want to get a first year finance student to explain to you how Commodity Markets work, And big oil does not produce lots of jobs because of automation. God you are stupid.
4778 2018-11-22 16:43:00 mixing cooking oil with rice and sugar is awful as fuck, not to the tastebuds perse but awful to your emotions... you swallow that shit like "wow this is really what my life has come to"

4781 2018-11-22 16:42:44 The best way to GAIN respect from non-intellectual is to be a snake oil salesman taking advantage of them.

Also, the best way to LOSE respect from intellectual is to be a snake oil salesman in front of them.

Trick or Treat depends on what kind of people they are.

You could add To your mashed potatoes. Steam it and Mashit it. taste fantastic. Or mash by itself with sautéed onions
4797 2018-11-22 16:41:27 The point is we live in the here and now and even if every past President flinched from SA to secure arms sales or oil price stability, Trump is in charge now and he could and should not follow the same path. Don't you think he would have the same sentiment if it was your spouse?
4798 2018-11-22 16:41:26 yo you ever rip a oil pen so hard your nose stings and you start sneezin and the top of your head itch???
4799 2018-11-22 16:41:26 Apparently low enough to excuse the bloody death of a CNN reporter in Saudi. It’s brutal (literally) what becomes OK for cheaper oil.

4803 2018-11-22 16:41:14 Oil is getting low because the markets know your 1% bullshit tax give away to the rich was just a sugar stock buy back rush. Get ready for a massive recession.
4804 2018-11-22 16:41:12 Even if the price of cooking oil goes up to $30 on Friday, the people of Mtoko will always vote Zanu Pf because that's what they are trained to do. They are trained.

4807 2018-11-22 16:40:54 The U.S. uses far less oil from the Saudis then ever before. Can thank Obama for that, getting U.S.  dependency off middle east oil. U.S. produces more oil products then Saudis, why are you thanking them. If Obama didn't do what he said he would, we would still be at $135 Barrel

4810 2018-11-22 16:40:42 The US gets 40% of its oil from Canada, and only 9% from the Saudis. They aren't all that much a necessity. They can be dealt with. They are a welfare client of the US.

4822 2018-11-22 16:39:45 This Thanksgiving meal brought to you by outsourcing the turkey and desserts, along with a steady intake of coffee, CBD oil and a Sudafed PE. Being sick on a busy day is never fun, but thankful for remedies 
4823 2018-11-22 16:39:43 It’s not the same - turning forest into to palm oil plantations - turning forests into cattle ranches equals the same result. The issue isn’t about meat.
4824 2018-11-22 16:39:25 Saudis tried to raise oil prices and most US oil is Canadian. And of course the murdee story is a lie.
4825 2018-11-22 16:39:21 trying cbd oil for the first time. See what happens. I'll gladly take even a placebo affect.
4826 2018-11-22 16:39:21 And yes, I do think we should throw our Middle Eastern policy out the window. I do not believe in paying for oil in human lives, whether they're American or Iraqi or Iranian or Yemeni or Saudi human lives.
4827 2018-11-22 16:39:20 $DVN is an oil stock with so much potential.  Time to start looking at oil. Bottom is coming soon.
4828 2018-11-22 16:39:19 Saudi Arabia only provides 11% of oil to us. Guess who provides the most??  Canada yet you fight with our ally and neighbor. 
You keep lying about these fake jobs and the sales numbers. 
You are selling the heart and morals of this country for YOUR business interests.
4829 2018-11-22 16:39:13 Second to big jobs and oil on your Thanksgiving Twitter priorities.  Way to politicize and blather about stuff on your call to the troops, really heartfelt Thanksgiving wishes there.  What a disgrace.  Our troops deserve way better.
4830 2018-11-22 16:39:11 Hey Pres, can do you us a solid and check in on diesel and heating oil prices? We are getting the shaft here and I feel like your giving us the ole' bait and switch!
Thank you in advance for your lack of attention and response!
4831 2018-11-22 16:39:02 And 89% of our oil is sourced from somewhere OTHER THAN KSA.
4832 2018-11-22 16:38:58 Enough about "Fake News" n how the low price of gasoline is the result of your personal efforts w the Saudis! U need only 2 look in the mirror 2 find the most egregious purveyor of falsehoods, n only 9% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia, so u can stop defending your slimy pal
4833 2018-11-22 16:38:44 It goes wayyyyy deeper.  trump is involved with them for other reasons than oil. #FollowTheBenjamins 
4834 2018-11-22 16:38:44 I once tripped up over a piece of metal which caught my shoe,which then catapulted me into the air landing me on my hands into hole filled with mud & car oil.I rolled onto my back flailing hands in the air crying.Looked like a Turtle turned over!Can’t take me anywhere
4835 2018-11-22 16:38:41 Polar wandering, jet stream variations and extreme weather are the result of sea ice loss at the current poles..Trump has no clue, but the oil & gas industry know exactly what the consequences are, just think they’re rich enough to survive it, while billions won’t. sadlymistaken
4836 2018-11-22 16:38:31 Don’t be so crass! Robots today have bearings so sophisticated they don’t need such primitive things like oil.
4837 2018-11-22 16:38:26 its not in my means.big oil and gas can prove it by spending a small amount of money relatively soeaking for their opration. thing is that they have not demonstrated it, which can mean 2 things,they have tried and failed and not shared results or they agree with scientist.
4838 2018-11-22 16:38:23 I understand your anger.
But we can only effect change one step at a time. 
If Iceland helps to highlight the problems in palm oil dependence its a good thing...so long as any substitute for palm oil is not even worse. 
As for meat you are right but we are guilty at home too....
4839 2018-11-22 16:38:17 Gas prices this Thanksgiving are higher than they have been the previous 3 Thanksgivings.  So, I guess Obama gave us lower gas prices for holidays? By the way... You're a crazy dude, thinking you control the price of oil.
4840 2018-11-22 16:38:16 Our Page Eurpa team in Khazzan oil and Gas project
4841 2018-11-22 16:38:13 Hammering the CDN oil industry will get us nowhere. Burning coal for electricity and burning bunker fuel in the world's large ships account for more than 2/3 of all GHGs and other emissions.  If the world moved off these two fuels, much of the GHG problem would be dealt with.
4842 2018-11-22 16:38:12 Geeked off a perk and I’m sippin that oil 
4843 2018-11-22 16:38:11 @lenirobredo might take credit that the "government" she is part of has managed to control & reduce oil prices. Hay naku! Oh, where's Bam?
4844 2018-11-22 16:38:10 ｳﾞｧ
4845 2018-11-22 16:38:05 I just had a meeting with Steve Ford,  Gerald's son. He said pardoning Nixon was really hard on his dad, but wanted to heal the nation. A trial would be to hard on our country with the oil crisis & mass inflation. Pres Ford did what he thought was best for us, not for Nixon.
4846 2018-11-22 16:37:48 Mcam susah nak je nak oil change ngan baju camtu. Btw, you look stunning 
4847 2018-11-22 16:37:41 Oil prices haven’t dropped and the price of oil isn’t worth the price of an innocent American resident who was murdered!
4848 2018-11-22 16:37:38 วันนี้แฮปปี้ที่สุดเลย...
4849 2018-11-22 16:37:38 Which makes them hypocrites! And speciesists! They have also said they are reducing their vegan range: I do hope they lose lots of customers over this. You can't preach about the evils of palm oil & then not address the cruelty behind their food products.
4850 2018-11-22 16:37:37 Qué mamador.
4851 2018-11-22 16:37:35 We can win back America from the greedy rich and corporate control the oil companies and weapons manufactures the greedy politicians and war mongers if we all work together to build a more equal economic future for everyone with clean air and water HAPPY TDAY
4852 2018-11-22 16:37:31 So.. you think Mentos & Diet Coke is cool?

Hold my Dew!

Wait till you see what I can do with boiling oil and a partially thawed turkey!

#HappyThanksgiving #Fail #BeSafe
4853 2018-11-22 16:37:26 I am grateful you care to find facts and are willing to hold MBS or any other person accountable for their actions in Khashoggi’s brutal murder. This Thanksgiving I pray for justice—not for money and oil. #weneedmoralleadership

4855 2018-11-22 16:37:16 Did Bank of America teach you that? Sucker.

The cause for the crash was predatory lending and creating artificial values through "securities". 

This is veering off topic. The point is exploitation is a common practice under capitalism. We've seen it with banks and with oil.
4856 2018-11-22 16:37:10 today I would like to give thanks that oil prices are lower and jobs gained at the insignificant cost of aiding
4857 2018-11-22 16:37:09 Lately the two biggest annoyances are the way conservatives act as if the conservative party put the oil in the ground itself, and the utter inability to grasp the fact that a 70% drop in revenues is the root of our fiscal crisis, and not some imaginary mismanagement buy the NDP.
4858 2018-11-22 16:37:08 Lower gas prices have nothing to do with your fake hard work. Just the result of world oil inventories. You just want to take credit for it as you do for anything of economic benefit. Don’t hear you taking credit for the market losing all the value it gained in this entire year.
4859 2018-11-22 16:37:08 I blew one of those up when the low oil warning light failed.
4860 2018-11-22 16:37:06 ,now come and buy oil perfume
4861 2018-11-22 16:37:02 Avocado oil, lactic acid and aloe vera
4862 2018-11-22 16:36:59 The fucktard in the White House doesn’t know that 11% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia while 41% comes from Canada. Smdh
4863 2018-11-22 16:36:54 Yes it’s very easy, takes 30-40mins, Cook it in peanut oil
4864 2018-11-22 16:36:53 Apparently my mom only uses coconut oil as body moisturizer now, and let’s just say the scent is not agreeing with me.. 
4865 2018-11-22 16:36:50 if we meet I will make you version taught to me by a Thai lady. It is made of fried red small dry chillies in oil,  sugar and vingegar. When I make it at home - everybody runs out . The smoke itself is enougfh. Alt 2 is to put chilles in a bottle of vodka. pepper. lime-......
4866 2018-11-22 16:36:42 First, the billion dollars is exaggerated. Second, most of our oil comes from Canada. Third, YOU CANNOT PUT A PRICE ON SOMEONE'S LIFE! You don't care because he was an LPR and a Muslim. You don't care because you are owned by the Saudis. You don't care because it's YOUR wallet!
4867 2018-11-22 16:36:39 Нефть опять валится.

4868 2018-11-22 16:36:37 The kind that has been massacred by heathens? Seriously though I have no idea unless they’re using butter vs oil which is an option
4869 2018-11-22 16:36:35 @CoreyBooker2020 to my knowledge, as I have never witnessed this on the news either...  they have never been arrested for having stolen property!  Jim and Tammy Faye Baker were arrested when my grandmother sent them a check but, never have I seen oil or gas arrested here on news
4870 2018-11-22 16:36:34 Why are you wanting to try CBD Oil for?
4871 2018-11-22 16:36:31 Oh, yes I’m totally onboard with how devastating palm oil is.

But as you know, 60Billion animals require much more land and many more crops than 7.4Billion humans.

Animal ag is destroying ecosystems and the environment.
4872 2018-11-22 16:36:22 The oil companies decided a long time ago to start a campaign of denial with the public. It’s all about the money, trump knows the scam.
4873 2018-11-22 16:36:17 เฮ้อ
4874 2018-11-22 16:36:17 I feel you! Oil cleansing with sunflower seed oil has made my skin so supple.
4875 2018-11-22 16:36:15 Everyone should understand massive deforestation, plastic islands the size of Texas in the ocean, factory farm run off, oil spills etc. We don't have to trust climate scientists on those things.
4876 2018-11-22 16:36:08 Nixon ending gold std didn't affected dollar hegemony, because he linked it to oil. It's the weakening of petrodollar that's putting pressure on the usd's role as global reserve. "The Blob's" perpetual wars have harmed king dollar, and Trump's trade war with China accelerates it.
4877 2018-11-22 16:35:59 First it was the "$450 billion" they pay us for weapons, then the "tend of thousands of jobs", now the "low oil prices".  It sounds like he's still searching for a lie he thinks people are going to be convinced by.
4878 2018-11-22 16:35:56 But, low oil prices and arms deal!!!!!!
4879 2018-11-22 16:35:54 Lemur's Dick pics for oil program.

I thought the UN put a stop to that scheme?
4880 2018-11-22 16:35:49 We have heard.
You have too much oil in u.
It have do.
4881 2018-11-22 16:35:49 *feeds dog coconut oil*
me: barkley youre supposed to savor it!! umami!
mom: ay papi
4882 2018-11-22 16:35:37 What you’re saying is that you’re happy to trade blood for oil we don’t need. You’re for sale, and cheap too.
4883 2018-11-22 16:35:25 Although I read that the GOC will receive some revenue from Kinder Morgan this year, I'm thinking that full-price, pipeline-shipped oil royalties could bring much more revenue. #pipelines
4884 2018-11-22 16:35:24 Happy Thanksgiving to all @Lucas_Oil!
4885 2018-11-22 16:35:15 And there it is.  Xenophobia.  Just like I said about Maxime Bernier. What is Trudeau doing to the West? He bought the pipeline to save it. He's done more than anyone to save that pipeline. He's even started a group to help increase the cost of oil per barrel.
4886 2018-11-22 16:35:08 And don't forget that practically every scientist who disagrees is paid by the oil industry
4887 2018-11-22 16:35:05 Tea tree oil makes my face feel so refreshed
4888 2018-11-22 16:35:02 No, its Mexican oil... and the new president will build new oil refineries.
4889 2018-11-22 16:34:58 I don’t understand the perspective of the Trump critics. In fact we are influencing the amount of supply in the oil markets in part based on our relationship with the Saudi’s. The Middle East is a “rough neighborhood.” Which arab or islamic nations do you want to be allied with?
4890 2018-11-22 16:34:54 You should assassinate more Saudis to lower the oil price further.  They deserve it for 9/11.
4891 2018-11-22 16:34:54 Math = $2.50 a gallon vs $4.00 a gallon on a typical 14 gallon car.  Difference is $21 at the higher gas prices.  I don’t think this is worth risking TEXAS And Louisiana Jobs in oil & gas that depend on higher oil prices.  Airline and food prices won’t go down relatively.
4892 2018-11-22 16:34:48 Play Monopoly game to keep OiL prices LoW for Now.
4893 2018-11-22 16:34:45 What is the obsession with the US buying our oil?  Why does it matter if the exports stay in the US or shipped abroad?
4894 2018-11-22 16:34:33 diversification is great but why only oil we import tons of wedgies why not vertical greenhouses powered by solar panels then we would not hate to worry about quality
4895 2018-11-22 16:34:25 1/ Guess what? Notley has nothing to do with the WPS differential. Zilch.

None of the pipelines would have been transporting oil yet even if they'd gone ahead.

The crisis is caused by the industry. They want a) government to bail them out again, b) to force govt to work for
4896 2018-11-22 16:34:24 Me, smoking from a handy pen I charge like a phone, using an oil cartridge casually picked up from a local bodega.

Now *this* is the future we were promised
4897 2018-11-22 16:34:22 So very uninformed. We only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. It would be great if you knew something.....anything.
4898 2018-11-22 16:34:22 Rosehip oil and vitamin c!
4899 2018-11-22 16:34:09 Such idiots.  Go ahead sue OPEC.  U don’t think they will stop sending oil to USA.  Probably best thing u could do to drive up oil prices.

4901 2018-11-22 16:34:03 So, we are just supposed to let the kidnapping, torture, murder and dismemberment of a U.S. resident who worked for a U.S. company go unnoticed so YOU@finer_dan can have lower oil prices? You are missing a moral compass just like Trump! SHAME ON YOU.
4902 2018-11-22 16:34:00 That is because they prefer Saudi 'clean' oil.
4903 2018-11-22 16:34:00 Drain on an upside-down rack on paper towels on a sheet pan. Oil is grocery-store brand "vegetable oil" which I believe is canola.
4904 2018-11-22 16:34:00 もし自社でさばけない案件ありましたら、当社に振っていただきましたらしっかりさばきます！ かなりランク悪いなどの案件だけでもかまいません！ もしさばけない案件ありましたらよろしくお願い致します！
4905 2018-11-22 16:33:58 it's very very similar to couscous btw! 
I think we stole it from you and added galons of olive oil to it to make it palestanian
4906 2018-11-22 16:33:56 Love how you prioritize oil and money over humanity.  History will remember you as a base and amoral leader. Happy Thanksgiving.
4907 2018-11-22 16:33:56 You had nothing to do with it Donnie, Saudi Arabia pushed output because of global demand. The OPEC meeting in Dec is to discuss cutting productions. Which means much higher oil prices. And we get 40% of oil from Canada and o my 11% from Saudi Arabia. U still don't get it. Jagoff

4912 2018-11-22 16:33:23 Awesome would love to try this oil 
4913 2018-11-22 16:33:18 Only till the bastards figure out how to profit in some nefarious way. Like GMO cannabis oil. Likely to kill you slower than big pharma and its plane wide drug dealership. Look whats happening to the weed quality in the usa. SA is legal now.
4914 2018-11-22 16:33:08 He shorted oil.
4915 2018-11-22 16:33:06 So, I’m assuming that you live right next to the most polluting oil refinery on a busy road with traffic pollution and drink water from a oil sands settling pond. If not, then you are being rather hypocritical.
4916 2018-11-22 16:33:00 Yes--think that's oil and gas. You could look through the carbon major report (7 pages). Link is in the article...it will answer partly your question. I don't have the complete answers...I'm just a mere tweep who worries too much about climate change lol
4917 2018-11-22 16:32:55 There is little benefit to low oil prices as it’s a big export and lots of jobs. I vote for lower health care costs though as doctors and insurers make too much.
4918 2018-11-22 16:32:54 นอนไม่หลับ
4919 2018-11-22 16:32:51 Lol, and you know this how? One thing for sure it's that Trump's didn't shed a tear for him, and even negotiated his death with Oil and future land rights in Saudi Arabia.
4920 2018-11-22 16:32:48 Your station at Rumuibekwe By Aba Road is the best in the city. Right meter measurement, flexible payment options, constant fuel supply, engine oil and gas. It is the most complete gas station I know.  

The service is superb! Kudos guys. #FONearYou #ForteOil
4921 2018-11-22 16:32:47 Oil in a pot on the stove. IR thermometer to check temperature. Stir the oil and food with a wooden spoon now and then to circulate the heat. Use a spider to put food in, to check it for brownness, and to pull it out when Golden Brown and Delicious.

4925 2018-11-22 16:32:36 Yep, amen. Wish whoever thought that hot mess up (or found it at all persuasive) — trying to mix the oil and water of liberalism and anything like Biblical faith — would hear those words and take them to heart.
4926 2018-11-22 16:32:36 Trump, right now: " CIA goes both ways", regarding Saudi Arabia's murder of reporter. Oil over Blood. Lyin' P o S "BOTH WAYS"?  Like a turtle favoring a traitor.
4927 2018-11-22 16:32:34 Suit yourself! There isn’t another alternative that is sustainable today! That’s a cold hard fact! Canada has the number one oil gas industry in the world! We reclaim all our well sites to how they were before we got there! No one else on earth does that!!

4930 2018-11-22 16:32:28 I reckon the anti-vaxxer movement is about selling some sort of snake oil instead of vaccines to the gullible. Money truly is the root of all evil.
4931 2018-11-22 16:32:28 1.  The US is the biggest producer of oil in the world.
2.  40% of our imported oil comes from Canada. Only 11% comes from Saudi Arabia.
3.  Thanksgiving gas prices are highest in 4 years.
4. SA doesn't control oil prices. Global supply and demand does.
5.  You're an asshole.
4932 2018-11-22 16:32:19 rejecting cars is liberation: physical liberation from rolling steel cages, moral liberation from causing death and destruction with emissions, mental liberation from the delusion that we need oil companies, political liberation to demand my representatives kill an oil co.
4933 2018-11-22 16:32:15 How about You can stand in the kitchen to giver some rest with a well need detox bubble bath and oil her scalp wit them essential oil ( included tea tree oil,lavender) not for her to suck you dry later but to appreciate her,
4934 2018-11-22 16:32:10 It was a whole case study lol , just know that cbd oil can help
4935 2018-11-22 16:32:08 It only “takes months for oil supply to impact pump prices” 
WHEN 
OIL PRICE DROPS

...it is IMMEDIATE
WHEN 
OIL PRICE COES UP!
4936 2018-11-22 16:32:07 You  let them get away with murder. (By the way, they provide just over 10 percent of US oil). Dem Congress must add this to long list of investigations of your darkly criminal admin.
4937 2018-11-22 16:32:04 First he believes Putin over his own intel, now he thanks a Saudi for low oil prices at the cost of a human life.  What's next?  When does Congress impeach a president?  When he gets a BJ from an intern?
4938 2018-11-22 16:32:03 There is no Justice, we have a legal system!  If you want justice, stop buying oil.
4939 2018-11-22 16:32:00 Yeah, but I don't buy oil by the barrel and I don't stockpile it in case I can make a killing off of it once the prices go up again so how does that really help me?
And oh yeah, my taxes went down by about $10 a month so big whoopty doo! In 5 months I can buy a barrel of oil!
4940 2018-11-22 16:31:49 Pretty sure most of your oil comes from Canada
4941 2018-11-22 16:31:47 I done wasted my fav face oil n my damn head hurt... I’m soooo annoyed
4942 2018-11-22 16:31:43 What's worse than traitor trump and his acolyte @joelpollak ?  Trump, right now: " CIA goes both ways", regarding Saudi Arabia's murder of reporter. Oil over Blood. Lyin' P o S "BOTH WAYS"?  Favoring MBS is like Jews favoring Nazis.  Nicht wahr?
4943 2018-11-22 16:31:35 Hello Amy, 

Our hair products are not palm oil free. 

We source palm oil from companies that are members of the RSPO. 

This organisation ensures that all of the palm oil produced and sold comes from sustainable sources and does not lead to more rainforest destruction.

4945 2018-11-22 16:31:25 Omg almost in every cream, see why I stick to my ori and coconut oil or I rub nothing, skin's too oily anyway
4946 2018-11-22 16:31:22 They do own _some_ oil paintings and watercolours, and the national collection of miniatures (it's a thing, apparently), but they're vastly outweighed by photography and textiles and sculptures.
4947 2018-11-22 16:31:18 Both. Miceller utk make up tak tebal. Kalau i pakai make up tebal pakai cleansing oil.
4948 2018-11-22 16:31:14 Norway invested for all its citizens rather than squandered on the 1% its oil resources, so prob can afford to take a day off ...
4949 2018-11-22 16:31:14 Now, as I watch the sunrise.
Ah, the smell of oil, the morning light.
There's but one shadow cast on the asphalt.
4950 2018-11-22 16:31:01 God uses broken vessels, he uses lamps that have let their oil run out and he uses what the world has rejected to shine His light. That is how you know that God is God, because only he can use me.
4951 2018-11-22 16:30:44 But will you stop buying their oil? I don’t see the Trudeau government putting sanctions on oil imports following Mr Khashoggis murder. I don’t see a carbon tax on oil imports. All policies are to punish Canadian industry and preferentially support imports.
4952 2018-11-22 16:30:43 YOU LIAR tell the #Americanpeople the REAL reason why gas prices are lower? The REAL reason is because you ask #OPEC to produce more oil because of sanctions you where going to put on Iran but NEVER DID and OPEC is piss you lied to them and gas prices will be going back up soon.
4953 2018-11-22 16:30:40 11% of our oil imports and millions of dollars spent with Trump-owned businesses = the value of one journalist's life
4954 2018-11-22 16:30:38 But.... Oil.

4958 2018-11-22 16:30:06 RT @realDonaldTrump: Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let’s go lower!
4959 2018-11-22 16:30:02 Easy to agree with a person who you told what to say. The fact that you and your administration were are willing to look the other way because of oil and some wildly exaggerated military contracts is disgusting.

Well The Turkey imu just got drenched from passing liquid u'a ~ boiling oil perhaps? 
Happy Turkey, Gentlemen!
4962 2018-11-22 16:29:44 you all should look at types of oil and their uses, not to mention existing oil contracts of US Oil Companies that import solely saudi oil as there are many more impacts than you realize. it’s not just a simple “-11% calculation”.

4964 2018-11-22 16:29:39 Trump, right now: " CIA goes both ways", regarding Saudi Arabia's murder of reporter. Oil over Blood. Lyin' P o S "BOTH WAYS"?
4965 2018-11-22 16:29:30 Horses! Horses, are the solution to the oil supply issues. Genius! I'm formally announcing my candidacy for the 2020 Republican nomination for President. 
"Horses! Promises made, promises kept"
4966 2018-11-22 16:29:24 Denmark & Germany halt arms sales, they believe CIA & likely their own intelligence services

America helps cover up for the person who ordered the murder, who still has not given back the body

And says thank you to Saudi for drop in oil price, oil prices that always fluctuate

This sure makes you look like a two-faced hypocrite.

He's clearly not thinking big picture - just serving the oil industry. That's why people want to know his donors.

4970 2018-11-22 16:29:05 I need Black Friday deals on oil changes and tires ffs
4971 2018-11-22 16:28:59 Google Rick Simpson Oil. Watch any of the thousand videos he has posted.
4972 2018-11-22 16:28:56 It’s definitely when you break down the weed into oil and you mix it in with regular melted butter and you wait for it to solidfy and you can cook stuff with it lol
4973 2018-11-22 16:28:53 I think the US change in policy on Iran is the single biggest (but not the only) reason for the sudden bull to bear change. Initially US driving for zero Iranian exports and then suddenly issuing waivers to the 8 largest buyers of Iranian oil
4974 2018-11-22 16:28:49 And by praising Saudi Arabia for overproducing oil, artificially deflating the barrel price, and reducing gas prices, he's endorsing the killing of thousands of US jobs as it is. Wells that had reopened here will shut down again.
4975 2018-11-22 16:28:47 I'd say our constant violation of truces & treaties with desperation for dollarfication of global oil is the greatest threat to national security.
Now you set your sights on Iran because they dare to sell oil in any currency they choose.
4976 2018-11-22 16:28:44 The Saudis have been very influential for a long time...and remaining close allies should be a priority. We can more easily influence them to be better (more western) than if we had to play hard ball with them like we do with Iran. Oil is a factor, but it's not the only factor.
4977 2018-11-22 16:28:43 Jesus the dishonesty here. Energy in Depth is a front group. Climate Signals is a philanthropic science org formed in part by repentant oil legacy heirs to combat liars like Energy in Depth.
4978 2018-11-22 16:28:39 @LidlUK Hello, just interested to know what your future plans are regarding palm oil?
4979 2018-11-22 16:28:36 The V&A doesn't own a lot of "traditional art", if by "traditional art" they mean oil paintings and watercolours and that. It's the world's largest museum of decorative arts and design.
4980 2018-11-22 16:28:26 The US has become the largest producer of oil...  Why would we import?!?  How many vehicles, boats and planes are energized in the US and for that matter around the world?
4981 2018-11-22 16:28:26 Canada gives more oil the Saudis we give 40% they only give like 9% were the 1s you want to be nice to, not them, just saying, and he is playing with tariffs lol
4982 2018-11-22 16:28:26 These are painted on stretched oil painting paper & affixed with gummed tape. It's not a great look in my opinion! I do sometimes paint directly onto canvas board, but the paper is cheaper while I'm still learning (and the boards get re-used). Thanks for being so encouraging!

4984 2018-11-22 16:28:15 why don’t they make a beard oil bottle that doesn’t leak?
4985 2018-11-22 16:28:14 Hmmm. You just told me the other day we don’t need their oil. “It’s going to zero” you said (imports of foreign oil). Now you say they need us more than we need them. Which is it?  
[ok, I’m about to be blocked- I see it coming]

4987 2018-11-22 16:28:12 car wash n oil change needed...
4988 2018-11-22 16:28:10 There is no reason to bother unless they go oil free since palm is the most efficient of all oil crops. By giving up palm many replace with less efficient oils or animal products, and as such do far more damage to the world's forests.
4989 2018-11-22 16:28:07 おやすみゃ
4990 2018-11-22 16:28:06 So that is the gross number. The true liability is the net number. & today they hold on escrow the net present value of that liability as cash. The liability moves with production, oil price and discount rate. There accounting relative to say Fareo is actually very conservative
4991 2018-11-22 16:28:04 U r going to destroy US oil industry!  Need higher prices to survive.

4994 2018-11-22 16:27:48 They blew up the Twin towers, pay millions to terrorist groups, and depend on our military to protect them. In return we get 12% of our oil needs. But trump gets millions in the pocket, so ????

4999 2018-11-22 16:27:35 If you cared about oil prices, you would be  Canada's ass, not whining about Trudeau. They provide at least 40% of US oil, SA only 9%. Your issue with Canada is 2 Trump hotels there dropped your name, hence no $ in your pocket. Whereas SA keeps bailing you out of bankruptcy.
5000 2018-11-22 16:27:29 I wanna have fake outrage about the parade, too. I'm upset they included a SInclair Oil dinosaur balloon. Now I have to explain to the kids that I don't have that the gas I put in my car is dead dinosaurs and now they're crying. Way to go NBC. Thanks liberals. #MacysParade
5001 2018-11-22 16:27:27 Here surely Norway needs to spend some of their massive Oil fund money... Go get it lads @nff_info
5002 2018-11-22 16:27:26 As US, the only hyper power, seeks to accomplish world leaders' goals. Need Saudi Arabia's oil.
5003 2018-11-22 16:27:13 If #Trump knew anything about gas prices he would know that Saudi Arabia only contributes about 11% to the total oil used in the United States. 

The bulk of the oil used in the United States comes from the United States.

5005 2018-11-22 16:27:04 The last thing we need is the absence of any type of swing producer in the markets. Can't politicians understand the nature of supply/demand elasticity inherent in oil markets, and that it will be worse for the economy as a whole?
5006 2018-11-22 16:27:00 Canada sends some too and buys Saudi oil

5022 2018-11-22 16:26:08 i believe the same creatures in Benghazi also orchestrated Saudi Arabia. I believe the only country that will win with sanctions against Saudi Arabia is Russia. oil will raise $50 right after finished pipeline into Germany, contracts manufactureing and jobs would go to Russia.

5027 2018-11-22 16:25:56 Ah, of course no! This guy is so delusional that he thinks the sun rises and sets on his command. Of course the world oil markets raise and lower prices on Trump’s say so.

5030 2018-11-22 16:25:46 If America is going to be great we cannot take blood money from Saudis!

America has broken the strangle-hold the middle East had on us in the 70's; 

America is no longer dependent on Saudis oil!

We cannot let the monster in our oval office drag us through any more mud!
5031 2018-11-22 16:25:45 Why is Trump kissing so much Saudi behind? The US gets most of its oil from Canada and yet he has no problem attacking them. He is doubting our CIA and blindly siding with Saudi Arabia because of his personal, special interests. This isn’t America first- this is Trump first

5033 2018-11-22 16:25:34 ya but did Canada lower their oil price?
5034 2018-11-22 16:25:34 And it's oil we don't need or use. Oil is cheap because of domestic fracking ().

5039 2018-11-22 16:25:22 #trump claims gasoline prices are the lowest in the last 10 years another huge lie.

When #Obama left office the average price for gasoline was $2.13 per gallon. Today the average price is $2.60 per gallon.

Earlier today trump praised Saudi Arabia for keeping oil prices down.
5040 2018-11-22 16:25:21 Love the cutesy dinosaur balloons in the #MacysDayParade - meant to make a giant oil company look kid-friendly as if they aren’t destroying our planet

5053 2018-11-22 16:24:33 It should be mandated that Canadian oil be used in Canada before importing from foreign sources.  Pipelines should have been in place when the production was ramping up.  

More Canadian oil = more Canadian tax dollars for services and infrastructure.
5054 2018-11-22 16:24:16 Oil prices were literally $53.22 the day you took over office. They're like $54 today. You've done nothing because it's out of your control. Prices under your regime have gone up to $75 and back down to where they stated. Stop taking credit for shit you didn't do.
5055 2018-11-22 16:24:09 They'll care when we stop buying their oil. And ending our dependence on buying and selling oil is essential. We can't afford to pretend any longer that we haven't created a massive carbon emissions deficit.

We're up to the challenge. It starts with no more pipelines. Not one.
5056 2018-11-22 16:24:05 Oil prices don’t kill people. Planned Parenthood kills people.

5062 2018-11-22 16:23:40 Drilling rigs already do not pay carbon tax. Fuel used in exploration activities is already exempt. From what you are saying this change would extend that exemption to all users of marked diesel, which would impact ancillary oil and gas activities, road/lease construction etc.
5063 2018-11-22 16:23:33 So the dinosaur balloon in the thanksgiving parade is sponsored by an oil company

5066 2018-11-22 16:23:17 what a marathon of reminders why this holiday sucks from the oil company balloons to the desecrated land with old dudes carved into it to the country music
5067 2018-11-22 16:23:14 so don’t nobody got no oil huh
5068 2018-11-22 16:23:13 These adorable baby Dinos brought to you by an oil company. Happy Thanksgiving. Goodbye Earth.

5073 2018-11-22 16:23:04 Baby dinosaurs, Sinclair Oil dinosaur, more guest stars, and then the Red Ranger from Power Rangers.
For the latter float, I hope there are a bunch of guys in grey spandex going blblblblblblblblblblblbblblblblblblb.
5074 2018-11-22 16:22:55 dawn has been capitalizing on that oil spill for like ten years now
5075 2018-11-22 16:22:55 Sponsored by an oil company, like what the fuck
5076 2018-11-22 16:22:53 CBS idiotic and facts incorrect. Canada is not part of the Middle East cartel, which DOES greatly impact oil prices, so when Saudi or any of the other biggies moves a few points in either direction it moves markets
5077 2018-11-22 16:22:53 Wait, the “newly born dinos” are sponsored by Sinclair Oil?? Good on a petroleum company to find a cutesy way to remind us of extinction events. #macysthanksgivingdayparade
5078 2018-11-22 16:22:52 Another take: NO BLOOD FOR OIL.
5079 2018-11-22 16:22:49 Seriously? The dinosaur balloons sponsored by Sinclair Oil?  #BigParade

5082 2018-11-22 16:22:32 then they'll just buy Russian and Chinese.  The more important good news to that is U.S. oil production is phasing out OPEC's dominance as a global supplier. That means eventually they won't have the purchasing power they now have and won't be able to buy armaments from anybody.
5083 2018-11-22 16:22:29 DINOSAUR BALLOONS SPONSORED BY AN OIL COMPANY. STOP IT!
5084 2018-11-22 16:22:27 Is Facebook the new Standard Oil? Is Zuck the new John D. Rockefeller? Is Kara Swisher the new Ida Tarbell? 
5085 2018-11-22 16:22:25 Just thinkin about how an oil company used baby dinosaurs in their macys parade float
5086 2018-11-22 16:22:19 Sinclair Oil sent baby dinos to the parade and the irony is strong.
5087 2018-11-22 16:22:12 Sinclair Oil, a fossil fuel company, contributed dinosaur floats and balloons to the Thanksgiving Day Parade
5088 2018-11-22 16:22:12 Just look at what the NDP did this week, brought in three “oil” experts at what cost to help figure out why Alberta oil prices are so low. So lets give them more money to waste. Spring and fall elections cannot come soon enough.
5089 2018-11-22 16:22:12 Sinclair Oil, finding a more adorable way to pump the air full of dinosaurs. #macysdayparadeissurreal
5090 2018-11-22 16:22:11 ‘Friends Of Science’ -what a joke! Here, I’ve fixed your name: Friends of Big Oil.  Just so you know, I live in a community where increased tanker traffic would directly affect me. Not only was I barred from presenting to the NEB, the local mayors & MLA were too!! #LocalKnowledge
5091 2018-11-22 16:22:07 What I learned cooking Thanks giving dinner: you need grease for a lot shit. S/o to value time vegetable oil. That big bottle for a dollar came in clutch 
5092 2018-11-22 16:22:03 Dominance is one thing and by Shylocks is another !! They are after their pound of Flesh... which is beginning to hurt this world. How cheap do they want their oil and gas!! For crying out loud they are sitting on larger and vast reserves of oil & gas than the ME.
5093 2018-11-22 16:21:57 Sinclair dinos... because oil #MacysParade
5094 2018-11-22 16:21:55 Baby dinos brought to you by Sinclair Oil seems a little ... dark... for a Thanksgiving parade
5095 2018-11-22 16:21:55 An oil company has a dinosaur balloon. Awesome!
5096 2018-11-22 16:21:53 They oil their tools of oppression with a passion (army, CIO & police)
5097 2018-11-22 16:21:50 Thank the Gods that oil investment is dropping. Much better to put investment dollars into renewable energy. Keep oil reserves in the ground until they get $500 dollars a barrel for it.
5098 2018-11-22 16:21:49 Jab banks loan ka interest rate kam nahi karta, RBI jab kam kartha hai...

Oil companies thodi karnei wale hai...

Everyone is after profit. It's the middle class who is squashed!
5099 2018-11-22 16:21:49 Loving that these dinosaurs are being sponsored by “the family company Sinclair Oil”
5100 2018-11-22 16:21:48 Of course the dinosaur balloon in the parade would be sponsored by an oil company
5101 2018-11-22 16:21:36 Little baby din-o-saurs! 
Also, Balloonses! A grown dinosaur, brought to you by...oil.

5103 2018-11-22 16:21:33 An oil company sent dinosaurs

I'm trying to make a joke about capitalism here but I'm just so knocked out of my chair what the fuck
5104 2018-11-22 16:21:29 Wait wait an oil company has a bunch of dinosaur floats/balloons? Wtaf.
5105 2018-11-22 16:21:18 Ok do any of us want to talk about the fact that an oil company sponsors a Dino-themed float
5106 2018-11-22 16:21:02 31:16 Depur, and the fat that is being in oil, wood and peace? that he should be stronger over them, neither this fellow?  8:4 I am field, and will surely perish, and go to whielt decwer in a full tree thing.
5107 2018-11-22 16:21:01 Thank you Canada! I’m using my one #HappyThanksgiving⁠⁠ tweet to thank you, since we actually import $40B worth of oil yearly from you which is roughly 40% of our oil imports share making you our largest exporter. I apologize for the WH buffoonery you’ve had to deal with.
5108 2018-11-22 16:20:53 @meathead I mixed my Simon and Garfunk with butter instead of olive oil..... Good idea or bad?
5109 2018-11-22 16:20:53 Calls on oil sands LOL, so sanctimonious and yet so cringeworthy at the same time. EV is just a platform it's not even a source of energy, it's just another consumer of energy, same as any other form of transport. Does provide a lot of fuel for virtue signalling though.
5110 2018-11-22 16:20:51 And you are such an economic genius you have no clue how this is hurting AMERICAN OIL REFINERS!
5111 2018-11-22 16:20:43 Oil goes to the US at discount... because we can’t get it to a coast.. unfortunately then it goes to Oklahoma or Texas where it’s refined/blended from WCS to WTI. That where cash is lost. Not disagreeing with you
5112 2018-11-22 16:20:42 So investors or foreigners did not discover we have the atmosphere for GSM before coming to seek licence from our govmnt? What make it  different? Oil companies operate on our soil (Territory) so is GSM companies operate in our atmosphere(Territory)
5113 2018-11-22 16:20:40 When prices are so low, doesn’t that hurt American oil businesses?
5114 2018-11-22 16:20:34 Win-win

5115 2018-11-22 16:20:18 H*ppy thxgiving, thankful Lesley decided we are a “cbd oil” family for the holidays
5116 2018-11-22 16:20:18 Someone asked me at a dinner party "Why is supposed green group @EnvDefenseFund taking dirty money from the Norwegian government to promote dodgy REDD offsets which will let the oil industry off the hook and cause climate chaos?"

I really didn't know how to answer. Can you help?
5117 2018-11-22 16:20:16 Right. But that’s just one side. Palm oil and palm plants are the other, even more significant.
5118 2018-11-22 16:20:15 Its ironic that Trump doesn't even know that the U.S imports the largest amount of oil from Canada not Saudi Arabia, but I guess he doesn't feel the need to kiss our Prime Ministers ass.
5119 2018-11-22 16:20:14 IS THAT A SINCLAIR OIL DINOSAUR FLOATING OVER SIXTH AVENUE?

#MacysParade
5120 2018-11-22 16:19:59 Join me in weeping today as our angriest fowl friend has perished today and will be laid to rest in a hot metal box or vat of oil to honor him as we would honor the vikings of old. 
Happy Thanksgiving to all!
5121 2018-11-22 16:19:58 Right. I’m Canadian & offended Trump’s using small quantity “oil” as excuse to give Saudis his thumbs up on his own campaign journalists are Enemy of the People so if dictators want to kill them now - It’s open season. In 2yrs or less Saudis will pay CITIZEN Trump back. @AP @CNN

5123 2018-11-22 16:19:58 40% of the oil which is imported by the US comes from Canada. 11% comes from Saudi Arabia. Mr. Trump however does not receive any personal financial advantage from Canada. Mr. Trudeau is also not much of an authoritarian.
5124 2018-11-22 16:19:56 We live south of an area known for oil refining and chemicals. Ds has autistic behavior & dh had GBs #youDecide
5125 2018-11-22 16:19:55 if you don't think the Saudis have a major influence on global oil prices and oil prices here in the U.S., as well as U.S. gasoline prices, you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. #FactsMatter
5126 2018-11-22 16:19:54 You mean the US in particular? The Middle East and I laugh at you and your ignorance about napkins every single day. Have fun with the “oil” we sold you  we will certainly be enjoying all your money my boy

Who keeps children STILL in cages? Who demeans our very form of government because it still manages to check?
5130 2018-11-22 16:19:40 - Backing out of Iran deal so so far been shows to negatively effect us.  It has once again alienated us from our allies and strengthened other alliances with Iran that we cant control.  It has raised the price of oil and angered the world as we no longer have oversight over Iran
5131 2018-11-22 16:19:40 Why must u lie about everything? We get most of our oil 40%_ from Canada. We only get 20% from Saudi Arabia.  How does siding with a murderer keep the price down?  Everything is about money for u and ur supporters not Human rights is or American values.  You are morally corrupt.
5132 2018-11-22 16:19:37 Your mom is busy air drying her boots, thinking how worth it it's gonna feel to step on someone's neck for a 20% discount ye fish oil.

5133 2018-11-22 16:19:33 I would pay higher oil prices if it would have saved Khashoggi’s life...you really should get your priorities straight and condemn his brutal murder and dismemberment #resign
5134 2018-11-22 16:19:33 Needs more oil. 
5135 2018-11-22 16:19:25 No you sold America for oil.... sold it for a dead journalist... hissssss
5136 2018-11-22 16:19:19 You are really not so smart, The U.S produce more oil than the  Saudi Arabia, So that said we don't need them they need us.....You are not smart at all and I mean it

5141 2018-11-22 16:18:55 People keep asking me how it happened. How does the Northampton Police Department charge someone with possession of hash oil AFTER the ballot initiatve? It’s a good question.
5142 2018-11-22 16:18:55 I like to use a fishing rod to drop mine into a stock pot filled to the top with overheated oil. 
5143 2018-11-22 16:18:54 Except we don't sell the oil we produce. We hold it in our reserves
5144 2018-11-22 16:18:51 Hisssssss-blood oil-hisssss you’re in with the men who kill journalists and men who bombed the Twin Towers..how easily you have forgotten... whoops you don’t even remember.. you made up lies then... hisssss Blood money for cheap oil... cry for America as we’re bought and sold
5145 2018-11-22 16:18:47 Ya... I mean I think the angels will start to follow that note mentality more, maybe? People like @PatrickLor and @mmastrac hold AMAs/seminars specifically for oil and gas high net worth individuals looking to park money in tech.
5146 2018-11-22 16:18:44 Prove @realDonaldTrump is lying. Gasoline prices are down due to oil dropping bc of Trump policies and US is number 1 in oil! Al Gore told us by this time we would be burning up yet it’s record cold, #GlobalWarming is a lie to makes elite rich!#MAGA is good
5147 2018-11-22 16:18:38 Haha how times have changed from CC bieleber to heavy oil pumper, classic case of no common sense imo, just another Wacko Wynn will stay until voted out to trash bin of history imo
5148 2018-11-22 16:18:37 I remember this article Mark. Well written though lacked sharper commentary from industry “outsiders”. The reason for sticky pump prices, particularly in Africa, is absence/weaker anti-trust laws. World over oil is sold by cartels that must be fought at the intensity of cats.
5149 2018-11-22 16:18:19 We can encourage everyone to treat each other with respect and end violence too. In the mean time let’s work toward solutions with reasonable expectations of success in an effective time frame. Get off the crack pipe of foreign oil addiction then migrate to responsible energy

Oil on canvas, 2018.
5151 2018-11-22 16:18:09 Except with oil, gas, mining and quarry combined being only 9% of our GDP, that differential - self-inflicted by the industry - is not a reason for the industry you now represent to run roughshod over rights and environment.

5155 2018-11-22 16:17:48 So Mr; President Trump, The Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia is going to get away with MURDER, so long as he helps to keep oil prices down, the bloody lot of you are as corrupt as can be.
5156 2018-11-22 16:17:46 Trump given the statement that Crown Prince is not involved directly in the murder of journalist. Second day, Saudi reduced the oil prices by $25 for them. Can you read between the lines?
5157 2018-11-22 16:17:44 We need to dig for our own oil. Zero reason other than corruption and kickbacks and decades old ingrained policy that continue to make other countries wealthy, some of which are not our allies. We need energy independence.
5158 2018-11-22 16:17:42 Hahaha the only time when Trump pushes hard is when he poops. Oil prices are set by the global market. Trump taking credit for something he didn’t do as always.
5159 2018-11-22 16:17:32 Really? What do we need from them? 12% of our oil? We can get it other places cheaper. Weapon sales? They are not buying any from us. Protection from terrorism? The 9/11 terrorists were mostly Saudi Arabians. Looks like our "FRIENDS" are not very friendly to me.

5173 2018-11-22 16:16:12 American oil.....from Saudi Arabia....11% From Canada...44%
It's not oil pricing he's worried about.
5174 2018-11-22 16:16:12 He is just protecting his and Jarred C’s businesses in Saudi Arabia. This has nothing to do with arms sales or oil. It has everything to do with tRump and family. When are his minions going to wake up from there trance and see they have been fooled?!?

5196 2018-11-22 16:15:17 @sardesairajdeep 
Dear Rajdeep - our PM has definite vision to achieve self sufficiency in oil production and silently works towards it. Like self sufficiency in Electricity. This one of many areas. Can you say for sure RaGa has any idea how this can be achieved?
5197 2018-11-22 16:15:17 Wouldnt there be massive push back from American energy producers to block Alberta from joining? 

They after all are the number one beneficiary of 15 dollar per barrel oil.

5204 2018-11-22 16:14:37 4) be taught on probably the first day of Econ 101. It absolutely explains what’s going on in the oil markets, and nobody with any knowledge of either oil or economics would not attribute a large part of the low prices to the increased production of the world’s largest exporter.
5205 2018-11-22 16:14:28 We get substantially more oil fro. Canada so Saudi Arabia is not I'm charge of price fixing. Also your constantly changing numbers on the arms deal (no matter where they currently sit) are GROSSLY INFLATED. #Saudi_Arabia #ProtectMueller #Treason #TreasonousTrump
5206 2018-11-22 16:14:28 Even those that disagree with you? What about Reporters who lived here & Worked overseas in let's say Istanbul, Turkey? We Don't Believe a word you say like higher oil prices despite your claims that your friends in Saudi Arabia would keep a lid on Prices! LIES, LIES & More Lies!
5207 2018-11-22 16:14:26 Of course they are. And Latvia is selling oil to Saudis as well.
5208 2018-11-22 16:14:23 CbD oil has healing properties.
5209 2018-11-22 16:14:13 Hi @IcelandFoods your Christmas advert has really inspired us to make a fully palm oil free and vegan sports drink, which also comes in a biodegradable bottle! Thanks for changing the world!!!
5210 2018-11-22 16:14:08 2) Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, because it’s cheaper to ship oil a short distance than around the world. But the Saudis are supplying others, which means those other countries are not competing with us to purchase the Canadian/Mexican/Venezuelan oil, which lowers prices. It is
5211 2018-11-22 16:14:07 I would hate to see Alberta separate but curious,

Theres a clause somewhere that says if Canada or parts of Canada want to join the USA they will be immediately welcomed into the union.

If Alberta joined the States would the price of AB oil be that of WTI?

5215 2018-11-22 16:13:51 Hypocrisy is a bit strong? 
Companies can’t change everything at once.
Iceland is being clever using the palm oil advert controversy to promote their brand but it’s a start & should be supported.
Vegan/ vegetarian can be a big turn off to the public and is best not over promoted?
5216 2018-11-22 16:13:47 1) I know it’s an opportunity to trash Trump but at least understand how this works. It doesn’t matter where the Saudi oil gets exported to. It all goes to satisfy worldwide demand. It’s a supply/demand issue, and supply keeps prices low. We import oil from countries close to us:
5217 2018-11-22 16:13:45 We can get our oil from Canada, they aren’t killing our a Journalists, oh but they aren’t giving you secret loans so I guess that won’t work for you will it, Trump
5218 2018-11-22 16:13:42 Can't believe Trump on Thanksgiving attacked fed judges & poor migrants & stood by decision to take Saudi $$$ instead of condemning MBS. Guess oil prices. trade more important than any life. That's why dumb voters back him, just as Germans followed Hitler before he destroyed them
5219 2018-11-22 16:13:38 @ontarioisproud Just saw an ad for your "Stop Saudi Oil" website. Just wanted to take a few seconds to talk about something you guys said.
(1)
5220 2018-11-22 16:13:30 Add to that the FACT he has nothing to do with nor has he in any influenced the price of oil/gas.  His lies must be highlighted at every opportunity.  The country needs to know just how dishonest this man truly is.
5221 2018-11-22 16:13:23 American Oil from Saudi Arabia 11%. From Canada 44%
5222 2018-11-22 16:13:22 just remembered in high school one of the guys who changed my oil used my name from my credit card to add me on facebook and i was too scared to go back so I made my dad get my oil changed for me until I graduated
5223 2018-11-22 16:13:19 Summary. It was only a wee murder. Worth it for the cheap oil. Sure, you all do something not good. Eat your turkey.
5224 2018-11-22 16:13:15 Are all of your products palm oil free?
5225 2018-11-22 16:13:14 Sonic got through Oil Castle Zone: Act 2.
5226 2018-11-22 16:13:13 She supports military coups in Latin America, loves War, bank bailouts,etc. Her foundation only aids to enrichen its Saudi, UAE, Defense Contractor, big oil investors. Give me one example of something she has done for the people?

5230 2018-11-22 16:12:47 So Ross Thomson is going to quit then?? No... thought not. Dear lord... HR tories a bunch of liars. Get our hopes up only to let us down - AGAIN. And they're still peddling their snake oil that Scotland doesn't want indy! What a shower of nincompoops! 
5231 2018-11-22 16:12:40 Russia polices the Middle East so we don't have to, Saudi Arabia provides oil for our commercial air, etc. and North Korea is making peace with South Korea.
5232 2018-11-22 16:12:37 What jobs? What industries and where in the U.S.? If just in oil and gas, what is Saudi Arabia doing that will created even 100,000 new jobs in that industry? 

Love it how Republicans just say whatever with zero proof now. Makes every crash-landing into reality more fun.

Going to refute the 'Desmog blog' accusation above or are you just going to say 'tu quoque'?
5236 2018-11-22 16:12:21 WHERE S ASAD UMER, NOW OIL PRICE ARE  UP TO $54 PER BER. WHY OIL PRICES R NOT YET REDUCED ????
5237 2018-11-22 16:12:18 Dean, 
You absolutely revel in expanding the ignorance of your fan base.  It's always about trade. Anyone who has ever served in the middle east knows it's always to keep the oil flowing. A stable Afganistan disrupts the heroin trade. Look past your hate Dean. Free your mind.
5238 2018-11-22 16:12:18 I am sure Denmark and Germany will suspend sales of oil to Saudi Barbaria soon if the war will not stop. All those "sanctions" by the west are a complete joke!
5239 2018-11-22 16:12:16 Yes, screaming from here in Canada...and our oil is cheaper and cleaner too.

5253 2018-11-22 16:11:12 We get more oil from Canada (40%) than from Saudi (9%). Just thought you should know. Your protection of Saudi is purely personal. Worst “president “ ever.
5254 2018-11-22 16:11:10 If you're feeling adventurous, simply swap the seasoning oil.
5255 2018-11-22 16:11:08 PET PEEVE!!!! when ppl pronounce 'oil' as 'OY-YIL' or 'idea' as 'EYE-DEER'.
stop it.
5256 2018-11-22 16:11:07 Thx for selling the soul of America for oil we don't need.
5257 2018-11-22 16:11:05 @realDonaldTrump 45 your actions have put Americans at risk around the world for a business deal.  Our military now have a target on them.  Trading lives for oil is not a deal.  You are a TRAITOR.

5259 2018-11-22 16:10:41 ??? do you mean the beet salad with vinegar, olive oil, and garlic? 
5260 2018-11-22 16:10:41 Love to live under a progressive, left-wing government who *checks notes* buys oil pipelines, breaks up strikes, and massively cuts corporate taxes
5261 2018-11-22 16:10:41 Sorry Dumbo, but oil prices are still higher than when you took office. And you have nothing to do with them anyway, except indirectly by you horrible policies.
5262 2018-11-22 16:10:40 Cui bono?  Republicans, NRA, Big Oil, Pharma, Wall Street, Banking, Military-Industrial Complex, Russian Mafia, Semion Mogilevich, Saudi Arabia & TRUMP! The ones who don’t benefit are the American Citizens  who have Democracy ripped out of their hands!

5264 2018-11-22 16:10:32 No. He didn’t do SHIT. The market did. The US production went way up under @BarackObama, and the groundwork goes back before that. Ugh. “He physically pumped all the oil while he tweeted’ I suppose that’s next.
5265 2018-11-22 16:10:29 The oil goes the the US because the lack of pipeline capacity to eastern canada. Thats what the energy east pipeline that Trudeau cancelled was for. We could make canada energy independent as soon as that was finished.
5266 2018-11-22 16:10:29 Peppermint oil is really the best outside of smelling good asf.
5267 2018-11-22 16:10:26 @realDonaldTrump Cut those oil prices up like Khashoggi!
5268 2018-11-22 16:10:25 Nigeria was already looted, there's nothing left anyway. If somebody finds oil in your land then expect some bombings and genocide from the 'civilized' west.
5269 2018-11-22 16:10:21 So if we're going to subsidize oil transportation at a cost of ~$950million according to the article, + tax incentives for the wind & oil industry + billions for a pipeline + another 595 million to subsidize struggling media, where do we find the wealth creators to pay for this?
5270 2018-11-22 16:10:21 Their palm oil is sustainably sourced!

5283 2018-11-22 16:09:40 Does this mean you'll look into the products you sell that use palm oil in their ingredients?
5284 2018-11-22 16:09:34 I know.i participated in some meetings (working for state oil company)and I could be a witness of how this commies, true believers really think:to grab from those who own,even if they have earned their property with honesty.
5285 2018-11-22 16:09:34 40% of our oil comes for Canada and the rest from Mexico, Venezuela and us.  Lies again.  What example you are to our youth?
5286 2018-11-22 16:09:33 When I was at @UnilagNigeria, I had great dreams. I thought I would teach law, become a renowned advocate, go on to be Governor and President. Sadly, I am not teaching law. Though, I have become a gunslinger for oil companies in our Courts. Perhaps, I may still govern. I pray.

why Complete Sullen Silence??
5288 2018-11-22 16:09:27 I bet the answer is Canadian doesn't have the same amount of oil that Saudi has.
5289 2018-11-22 16:09:22 Incredible considering the most oil going to the US is from Canada.  Oh I forgot we are the evil regime.
5290 2018-11-22 16:09:18 I have an idea. Why don’t you start pushing for policy that prioritizes renewable energy? Then we can move toward energy independence and you can stop stop kissing the asses of murderous regimes. Oh wait, that’s not about oil, it’s about emoluments. You are so transparent Spanky.
5291 2018-11-22 16:09:14 Once ready get the whole bird as absolutely dry as you can (I go through tons of paper towels). I then stick seasoned butter under the skin and oil the outside of the skin. About the only way to crisp brined skin.

5293 2018-11-22 16:09:12 Let us NEVER forget, 9/11/2001, 15 Saudi Terrorist flew planes into the WTC, the Pentagon, and one plane crashed (Shot Down) in PA. We retaliated by starting a war with their COMPETITION Iraq. The Saudis were so appreciative they raised the price of oil from $20 a barrel to $160.
5294 2018-11-22 16:09:10 I’ll be at Lucas Oil tomorrow but not Saturday. You will be there tomorrow, right?
5295 2018-11-22 16:09:07 We get most of our oil from Canada
5296 2018-11-22 16:09:00 I just remembered showing up to work on my first day of NSS with anointing oil on my forehead  and my dad telling me ...
"Go and make wealth "
I swear naija never carry last !!
5297 2018-11-22 16:08:59 Chuck, the oil prices are coming down because our output is rocking! Our economy is affecting others’.
5298 2018-11-22 16:08:56 Not many people realize that all the natural gas emitted by oil pumping on the Grand Banks is burned off into the atmosphere. No carbon footprint there for sure.
5299 2018-11-22 16:08:53 The Axis power of the internet. Google, Twitter & Facebook.
I would say it's time for trust busting at the level of the oil barrons during the early 20th century, but Congress are owned by those three.
5300 2018-11-22 16:08:50 Selling weapons of mass killing to a repressive, authoritarian regime that MURDERED a U.S. resident & respected journalist is obscene! Trump is LYING about the arms sales to Saudi - NOWHERE near $400 billion, and no deal has even been signed! U.S.A. produces all the oil we need!
5301 2018-11-22 16:08:31 Oil Companies Protect their own interests Only.
The NL Government should act responsibility.
5302 2018-11-22 16:08:24 In his applause for Saudi Arabia’s increasing supply to lower oil prices,#FailedPresidentTrump is also attacking one of his main constituencies in the United States, oil and gas.
5303 2018-11-22 16:08:23 And of course they forget to mention that Oil prices were lower the day Obama left office....

Big oil is doing the same. Trashing the environment for profit and expecting a taxpayer funded cleanup.

Clear as day.

Don't forget.
5311 2018-11-22 16:07:55 A good start would be to make all your Tesco brand products free of palm oil.

5314 2018-11-22 16:07:47 40 % our oil is from Canada. 9% Saudi Murder Arabia
5315 2018-11-22 16:07:46 Oil prices fell because Saudis increased production to make up for missing Iranian oil. An agreement with Trump to keep oil prices low before the election. Election's over & Saudis are decreasing production. Prices will soon rise.
5316 2018-11-22 16:07:42 Don't understand you being so proud of getting oil prices down.  Thought we lived in a free economy and the markets dictate the price.  If your controlling prices get your damn outrageous hotel prices down!  MAGA
5317 2018-11-22 16:07:38 So… Brutal, inhuman murder is OK with you, b/c you think that Saudi Arabia spends blood money on US private interests? You think oil is thicker than blood?

I don't care that 5000+ troops are doing a job that pays less than minimum wage across several states.
Gas and Oil prices will rise 1/
5340 2018-11-22 16:06:22 
5341 2018-11-22 16:06:19 Is this oil on canvas?
5342 2018-11-22 16:06:13 Blood for Oil
5343 2018-11-22 16:06:13 If Osama bin Laden would have returned to his family in Saudi Arabia after supporting the US efforts in Afghanistan, Trump would excuse the 9/11 attacks because “The world is a nasty place.” But the oil.
5344 2018-11-22 16:06:10 So for #Brexit #LittleEngland using
 Scottish Fishing as a bargaining chip
 Scottish Oil as a bargaining chip
 WMD Abomination based on Scottish Soil a bargaining chip

Scotland just a resource to be used&abused - the price of being dependent
#DissolveTheUnion #ThisIsIT
5345 2018-11-22 16:06:10 How does that make American Oil producers better off? It doesn't. This decrease in oil price is simply a diversion to take the spotlight off a murderous member of the Saudi Arabian kingdom. Why would anybody thank a country you refuse to acknowledge committed a heinous murder.
5346 2018-11-22 16:06:04 ひ・・・表示バグだよきっと・・・
5347 2018-11-22 16:06:03 So when oil prices rise we can take SA to task for Khashoggi and Yemen and 9/11. At what price is it safe to bring these issues up?
5348 2018-11-22 16:05:58 Umm right now US is producing more oil than Russia and Saudi. Why do you want us to patchim in the back?
5349 2018-11-22 16:05:52 The man behind me judged me for buying 80 pounds of cat litter and 48 cans of cat food all while wearing a 2nd amendment sweatshirt and buying frying oil. Life is a rich tapestry.
5350 2018-11-22 16:05:51 Actually, please thank Canada who supplies 40% of oil to USA vs 11% Saudi and we don't kill and dismember journalists
5351 2018-11-22 16:05:49 #LegalTechSummit2018 DATA IS THE NEW OIL

5357 2018-11-22 16:05:29 Decided to read the back of my Olive oil bottle. 94% pure soybean oil and 6% virgin olive oil. Got me. 
5358 2018-11-22 16:05:01 I’m cooking arroz con gandules and I really forgot to add oil to the bottom of the caldero 
5359 2018-11-22 16:04:57 The United States receives 11% of its imported oil from Saudi Arabia. It’s lagest int’l provider of oil is Canada which contributes just over 40%. Canada also has surplus production capability that can easil fill any gap left by a Saudi oil embargo with the USA.

5364 2018-11-22 16:04:37 This year instead of having cranberry sauce we will gather around the diffuser and waft cranberry essential oil between bites.
5365 2018-11-22 16:04:37 It used to be blood for oil. Now it's blood for condo sales.
5366 2018-11-22 16:04:36 We need the Saudis like we need another hole in the head. Most of our oil comes from Canada. A fraction from SA.
5367 2018-11-22 16:04:30 Jim determined the oil company’s had no interest in developing gas. That is about a lame as it gets.
5368 2018-11-22 16:04:06 Also Ted, Canada supplies more oil and gas to US than the Saudis yet we are hit with steel and aluminum tariffs on 'security' grounds.
 WTF.

5371 2018-11-22 16:03:52 US defence supports a massive arms industry  which contributes to jobs plus research n development giving us products like bluetooth. US uses the army to enforce its foreign policy to secure the much needed oil and geopolitical strategic areas for its economy.Venyu vanoitei?
5372 2018-11-22 16:03:48 America cannot attack Saudi Arabia. We give them weapons and protection and they only sell oil for dollars. Why else do you think we are no longer on the gold standard.
5373 2018-11-22 16:03:44 I posted an article for your convenience. “Maybe you should go vegan” isn’t stating facts, that’s shaming, which is counterproductive. Instead of letting the Palm Oil topic take hold in their mind, you’ll convince them to say there’s no reason to bother.
5374 2018-11-22 16:03:41 So Babar came all the way from Ferghana, Uzbekistan to poor India which had no resources, as part of his CSR activity.

No invader ever attacks a poor country 
It is bad return on investment!

And wat finished goods did they export - automobiles, software, oil, consumer durables?
5375 2018-11-22 16:03:41 Nothing I am aware of...same thought

And... we have all ridden gas prices from $2.59 to $4.99  and back again... and can do it again, especially in context of DOING what is RIGHT.  Oh.. and Canada  has more oil if we need it...
5376 2018-11-22 16:03:40 Trump removes fuel economy standards, originally created bc of the Arab Oil Embargo. Were back to 70’s policy.  It’s Moron economics folks.
5377 2018-11-22 16:03:39 Knowing climate change would raise the oceans, oil rigs platforms were raised years ago.
5378 2018-11-22 16:03:37 KSA can say whatever it wants, quotes of "will meet any demand" speak for themselves. If you believe KSA, awesome, trade it. But KSA did not fail to exploit cheap oil just so others could spend billions on deep water & oil sands. Think about that before quoting KSA prod cap.

5381 2018-11-22 16:03:20 If we are so powerful @realDonaldTrump we can equally apply pressure, on Saudi Arabia, on the pricing of oil and demand the days of MBS reign are over. What price for murder?

5382 2018-11-22 16:03:20 Any females want to hang out and avoid buying products with palm oil with me?
5383 2018-11-22 16:03:18 I’m thankful for our dear brothers and sisters to the north who supply 40% of our oil, fight at our side in every major conflicts for 100 years, and don’t murder American journalists. Funny how you don’t grovel to them for cheap oil...

5385 2018-11-22 16:03:04 Sorry Trump, I'm not going to share any in of the blame for MBS murdering journalist Jamal Khashoggi. And MBS has nothing to do with oil prices. Just more lies from the worst President in history.

5387 2018-11-22 16:02:59 The weird part is that we only get about 9% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. We get 40% from Canada. Further, we bring in significantly more money in tourism from Canada than any other country. Yet, he’s driven a wedge between us & Canada! Meanwhile, he personally profit$ from SA
5388 2018-11-22 16:02:57 Sorry should have written 40% of our imported oil is from Canada. SA 11%. So if we produce 80% ourselves that makes SA 11% of 20% or 2.2% of our total.

5401 2018-11-22 16:02:22 Hurrah! finally someone says it like it is.  It's not oil price or arms that patriotic Trump worries most abt, it's abt his money

We could militarize the whole border. Not sure whst that would cost, but I bet it's more than the cost of irregular crossers.

5409 2018-11-22 16:01:35 The trade war with China resulted in China halting imports of U.S. oil. Prior to that, U.S. oil producers had been shipping half a million barrels a day to China. This loss of market hurt U.S. oil producers, and helped push inventories higher in the U.S.  FORBES
5410 2018-11-22 16:01:31 I do not understand why we sacrifice morals for money and oil by entertaining barbarians. All they do is seek attention of our govts and leverage by using our citizens as pawns. No doubt they will be happy our PM and Govt will rush to make his highness feel important.
5411 2018-11-22 16:01:19 No we don't give we just don't take. Please learn the difference between direct and indirect subsidies which every country in the developed world does from agriculture to oil.

5413 2018-11-22 16:01:10 If course you know that oil companies have accepted as truth for awhile now that because of them the poles are melting & ocean levels rising which is why they planned for longer drilling periods in the Arctic & raised the height of their offshore drilling platforms.

5422 2018-11-22 16:00:53 Yes I do. I have uncles who served. My father served, etc. But those days are long - long gone. And let's be honest: the biggest threat to our freedoms are Home Grown.

5429 2018-11-22 16:00:30 That looks great! Is that the avacado oil on the lower shelf?
5430 2018-11-22 16:00:27 The shock is not a result of a lack of oil, it is a lack of access to the oil. Shale can ramp all it wants, at some point its uniformity hits a demand wall. Complex oil slates are required, shale is a part of this, the other parts are soon to be missing, until basin exploitation.

5452 2018-11-22 15:58:27 $JPM JP Morgan has revised its outlook for oil, predicting that Brent crude prices will average $73 a barrel in 2019 witch down from the investment bank's previous forecast of $83.50 a barrel.

5465 2018-11-22 15:57:26 I seem to always have a car needing to have the oil changed so it's good to have some on hand. Not very exciting though

5468 2018-11-22 15:57:15 On Thanksgiving you’re bragging about Saudi oil prices lowered only because you agreed to support the murderers of Jamal Khashoggi? We do NOT accept it! America doesn’t run on blood money!!
5469 2018-11-22 15:57:12 Moral fiber of starting another foreign war? Democrats have become war mongers.  Oh, you’d be the first to cry like a baby if oil doubled in price.
5470 2018-11-22 15:57:12 We pay less for oil & reduce our import bill. Also Saudis not having excess money is good 
5471 2018-11-22 15:57:09 Learn the history of football mate ur being ridiculous... How do u think Juventus Milan AC Inter Real Barca etc were built?!? by spending (a lot) more money than their competitors!! And Qatar is gas money not oil btw...
5472 2018-11-22 15:57:08 Are we also thankful for the #carbon emissions that result from gas and oil combustion?
5473 2018-11-22 15:57:05 We don't need to be reliant on the Middle East for oil.  Failure to  punish Saudi Arabia is NOT in this country's best interests. Failure to promote renewable energy sources is NOT in this country's best interests.Your policies are hurting this country's future. #WorstPotusever
5474 2018-11-22 15:57:00 This is bullshit.  Saudia Arabia makes promises but do not spend the money they promise.  Not long ago you were touting how US didn't need anyone elses oil. #TRUMPFAIL
5475 2018-11-22 15:56:58 Why do you people keep calling me sir???

5483 2018-11-22 15:56:36 Hi Milan: If Rachel closed the oil fields tomorrow,will you get yourself a horse and carriage and heat your house without electricity and light your lamps with ethanol? America pays Alberta 14.79 per Barrel, we pay America 56.00. Is that helping the atmosphere? Easy to criticize.
5484 2018-11-22 15:56:32 Now back to oil: sure, low oil prices are great for the American consumer...for now. But the reason for the low prices is the decline in American exports, thanks to our CEO's impulsive foreign policy.
5485 2018-11-22 15:56:29 I feel your pain. 
We’re having the same issue. Oil only works for a day or so.
5486 2018-11-22 15:56:21 I'll just bet he does since americans believe he was involved & want him to shove his oil up his wazoo & keep our military equipment.

5489 2018-11-22 15:56:04 You import 11% of your oil from KSA, 40% comes from Canada. One lie unmasked. The world is not to blame. The man who ordered him killed is. Another lie.

The president of the United States is explaining why oil from Saudi Arabia is more important than human life. 
Also, he's putting Saudi Arabia first.
How does this #MAGA
5506 2018-11-22 15:55:25 The general population does not understand the upgrading of heavy oil in a cold climate. This operation runs 24/7. If any components are shut down It must be done with great care & thought. Once running,it must continue, when not, many expensive difficulties may occur.

5509 2018-11-22 15:55:15 True, but the election of an anti oil premier solidified that the downturn stayed alive. Instead of just a normal correction like every other downturn has been.
5510 2018-11-22 15:55:05 And Europe and South America. Oil demand is growing. We are the only country capable of bungling such a resource

Want Trump to speak out against Putin? What are you crazy? WW3? Hello!? 

Want Trump to speak out against MBS? What about oil prices!!!
5514 2018-11-22 15:54:41 USA. Selling ourselves out for oil. Waking up yet, Trumpsters?
5515 2018-11-22 15:54:35 Big money in jobs and oil...no matter who dies...it's all about that bottom line... now your true colors are showing...Khashoggi could have been anyone of us.. expendable
5516 2018-11-22 15:54:28 Not going to make first I heard about it 10 am on the nov 22, I have the time the oil rig I was working on just suspended all drilling on Monday
5517 2018-11-22 15:54:19 And you just made it meaner. Today is Thanksgiving. Look at all these hateful tweets you have posted today. As for Saudi, you mean all the money you got from them on real estate purchases. OIL & "Big" Jobs, You mean minimum paying jobs, not "big".
5518 2018-11-22 15:54:14 I wanted to stop dealing with Saudi Arabia since they did the oil embargo. My memory is so long. They are a very bad  nation that should’ve been dissolved years ago. We don’t need them. Jared kushner needs them

5525 2018-11-22 15:53:50 Let's also not forget that 50% of palm oil production is pushed into biodiesel. Environmentally diesel is really a bit bad.
5526 2018-11-22 15:53:48 @Andre
Canadian Natural  Resouces Steve Laut also conveniently left out that the US is the largest importer of Canadian oil.
5527 2018-11-22 15:53:40 Fear Trump supporters your President has just said he’s OK with MBS murdering and dismembering a US resident because SA gives us oil and promises weapon purchases. Are you really OK with that? Are you? It’s OK for the USA to turn a blind eye to MURDER & TORTURE for money & oil ?
5528 2018-11-22 15:53:31 literally blood for oil
5529 2018-11-22 15:53:31 Planet Earth destroying its lungs. Strange how many similar products that contain Palm Oil on supermarket shelves in fact don't have PO in them. So some do it (for cheapness) whilst others dont!
5530 2018-11-22 15:53:19 I thought we got more oil from Canada?
5531 2018-11-22 15:53:17 The whole idea of boycotting palm oil completely to save one species is a terrible idea. Go for sustainable plan oil products rather than boycotting it completely or we’ll 100% face bigger issues

5541 2018-11-22 15:52:14 Ya, because outsourced all our production to thos barbaric counties and aloud OPEC to thrive. If it hadn't haave been for oil companies furthering drilling tech and out drilling those shitty sand people who practice vaginal mutilation on the reg we would be owned by Saudis.

5546 2018-11-22 15:52:04 Asked President Trump about Khashoggi killing minutes ago. He said that Crown prince regretted the death even more than he did, that the “world” was to blame, that the CIA had not concluded that MBS was responsible and that low oil prices were a key reason not to punish Saudi.

5550 2018-11-22 15:51:46 Angel investing in Calgary is pretty solid imo. Lots of oil and gas money sidelined right now. If you have a tech business that isn’t overly complicated and has a clear path to profitability (whether you choose to cash flow or not) there’s investors.

5552 2018-11-22 15:51:37 Yes. Relinquishing palm oil means that damage will be moved elsewhere. It's unfortunately very cheap to produce though. The demand for all oils will only increase. It's sad, we're in a place where we need to chose which habitat to decimate first...
5553 2018-11-22 15:51:36 I know it’s hard to believe this hypocritical snake oil salesmen @Nigel_Farage with the amount of lies, superstition and deflection he spouts. But this comes from a direct quote.
5554 2018-11-22 15:51:34 The best balance to the game is removal of boosts. I believe you can do it, and the majority of Robocraft players have faith on you.

5558 2018-11-22 15:51:23 US Presidents have little to no power over the cost of oil.
5559 2018-11-22 15:51:22 We get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia.
Stop lying. You’re a disgrace!
5560 2018-11-22 15:51:22 What is outrageous is that the leader of a provincial party is working for the oil industry.
5561 2018-11-22 15:51:11 Also a reminder that Canada supply's 40% of US oil.
5562 2018-11-22 15:51:08 I supply oil + gas products...help me make my first supply, its Christmas already... Money no dey,abeg!
5563 2018-11-22 15:51:05 US Oil Imports:
40% Canada
11% Saudi Arabia

Try being nicer to Canada!  Let's be real, this has everything to do with how YOU benefit from the Saudis not how America benefits.

5567 2018-11-22 15:50:55 They don't care.  They'll pick short term gains over long term sustainability all day long. President Trump just tweeted about how low oil prices are.  This plays well with his base.

5573 2018-11-22 15:50:40 Remove the tariffs on our steel and we’ll send you more oil!
5574 2018-11-22 15:50:36 As one that works in this industry, i can tell you that no president really impacts oil prices.
5575 2018-11-22 15:50:36 لا وألف لااااااااا.
5576 2018-11-22 15:50:29 Don’t confuse regular with the facts, Trump has done nothing to improve oil production other than remove environmental regulations so we all have dirtier air and water and therefore spend more on health!
5577 2018-11-22 15:50:29 What happened to "drill baby drill"? tRump administration 'plan' to become less dependant on foreign oil? Now we're thanking Saudi Arabia for low gas prices???

5580 2018-11-22 15:50:17 The resources might be owned by the province but foreign companies are taking it out of Alberta. And people wonder why we don’t know how much oil leaves everyday or exactly how much money we’re losing per/day.
5581 2018-11-22 15:50:16 Sitting still definitely makes me colder. I’m working from home today too and I feel like I need to go out and buy gloves.

5588 2018-11-22 15:49:50 Watching @Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. It's one big corporate gang bang. Sinclair Oil has a float - a big green dinosaur. The kind that went extinct, same as us thanks to fossil fuel companies like Sinclair Oil.
5589 2018-11-22 15:49:48 We've had Blood Diamonds  now we have Blood Oil
5590 2018-11-22 15:49:43 Gas prices are a function of supply & demand for oil. You have done nothing but tweet about it and give waivers to Iran sanctions which allowed oil prices to fall on oversupply concerns. If anything, you've went back on your own words. Not fake news, just you making it about you
5591 2018-11-22 15:49:42 @realDonaldTrump is correct that he’s responsible for the dropping oil prices. Oil prices are falling because it’s anticipated that our economy is slowing down and therefore demand for oil will drop. The economy was doing well until he started his ridiculous tariffs.
5592 2018-11-22 15:49:27 Things you learn by watching the Thanksgiving parade: There’s an oil company with a dinosaur as its mascot. 
Sinclair Oil: Kids, meet Dino! 
Kids: Yay!

5595 2018-11-22 15:49:16 I would imagine that number is continuing to drop due to the number of hybrids and fully electric cars being sold here. That scares the oil industries.

5598 2018-11-22 15:49:05 Oil prices are HIGHER now than when you took office, you rat-haired nutbag
5599 2018-11-22 15:49:04 Than you Canada! Uhm, we get 40% of our oil from Canada. We get 11% from Saudi Arabia. Mr. President please educate yourself and stop embarrassing your country. Go visit the troops in person, not from the golf course.
5600 2018-11-22 15:49:02 Gas prices have gone up over $1 a gallon since you entered office. Everything is costing more, even cereal. Grab you ID and go shopping to see for yourself. Saudis only provide 11% of our domestic oil. Canada, whom you insult daily, 40%.
5601 2018-11-22 15:49:02 While you were cooking? He told you he doesn’t like how garlic smells while you were preparing food for him to eat? Throw the oil on ‘em, Taylor.
5602 2018-11-22 15:48:53 나 그것보다 늦게 일어나는데...
5603 2018-11-22 15:48:51 Best way to do these:

Wash and slice the sprouts
Drizzle with olive oil, salt & pepper
Roast for 18 minutes at 400
Remove from oven, throw away, and eat lots of mashed potatoes and gravy.
5604 2018-11-22 15:48:50 It a rush to oil, read about this years ago. Whose going to tap the well first?
5605 2018-11-22 15:48:47 Thankful for UCF football, all my side hoes, Donald Trump, oil, and most of all Head and Shoulders. Happy Thanksgiving!
5606 2018-11-22 15:48:37 So US fuel has the same landed costs as Malawi? So US imports in Kwacha as well? So Malawi flacks oil in Texas as well? What are the average pump prices for our neighbours who have ports (add logistic costs to Malawi). Does MW have refineries like US. This is a false equivalence
5607 2018-11-22 15:48:33 Akwa Ibom state used to be one of the most peaceful state in Nigeria,APC has taken their "i must collect one or two oil states mentality" to that place.Akpabio should be ashamed of himself!
5608 2018-11-22 15:48:20 First off, he acts like Saudi is SOLELY responsible for the price of oil. 2nd, he acts like if he harshly criticizes MBS that the relationship will end AND result in higher oil prices.
5609 2018-11-22 15:48:17 WE CAN'T WIN WITH YOU FAKE PRESIDENT...PRICE WENT DOWN 1/2 OF 1%...HEY I KNOW YOU AND I CAN REMEMBER AS KIDS WHEN IT WAS 35 CENTS A GALLON..WITH SUCH AN OIL GLUT WHY ISN'T IT...35 CENTS A GALLON?????
5610 2018-11-22 15:48:14 Happy Thanksgiving to you,  Todd. and RatBoy too!  Chicken, dressing, acorn squash, vinegar & oil cucumbers, and a bottle of white zinfandel--may throw in some broccoli or Brussel sprouts---that is my menu---nothing like it use to be!!
Love, Mom & RustyRat
5611 2018-11-22 15:48:12 Of course re price. The liability is held gross today But the real cash assuming paid cash tax is net. Which given cost base is very likely. U hold today a provision of the net present value of that liability which changes with time, discount rate, production volumes & oil price
5612 2018-11-22 15:48:08 흠 최소 20분에 나가야하는데 말이되나...
5613 2018-11-22 15:48:08 Notley in Calgary: oil drillers will be exempt from carbon tax and will get rebates going back to the beginning of its implementation.

Carbon tax is a failed attempt for social license that just cost our industries.

5616 2018-11-22 15:47:50 From what I understand, and I could be wrong, we have a pretty large surplus of oil here. So, if thats is the case, we dont even need their oil. Not yet anyway. Trump is only looking out for his properties in Saudi Arabia.
5617 2018-11-22 15:47:49 To be fair they've had help with 20 years of Reform, Alliance & Con snake oil salesmen lustily screaming about media bias.
5618 2018-11-22 15:47:47 MORAL BLACKMAIL!  You've spoken of Obama's blackmail paid to Pakistan etc.
What about the blackmail that you are currently paying to the Saudis for giving up "THE MORAL VOICE OF OUR COUNTRY" (Lindsay Graham's words!)
They murder a journalist, we turn our heads for low oil prices!
5619 2018-11-22 15:47:46 I guess with this logic we can now go back in time and with certainty say that the war in Iraq was definitively not about oil...clearly Canada is the oil giant...#havingitbothways
5620 2018-11-22 15:47:45 Thanks alot!  Now Trump will impose tariffs and taxes on Canadian Oil, unless Trudeau kills a journalist - Then Canada will get a pass!  : )  But that is highly unlikely!
5621 2018-11-22 15:47:45 She does not have to smoke a joint. She can use the oil like I do. Rice grain amount on a piece of chocolate  & I have to say, it’s helping. My primary care doc does not inspect my urine. He knows I’m in a legal program.
5622 2018-11-22 15:47:44 "They are almost done, Shuhei, now it's mostly letting them chill a little bit and they're ready to eat."

She grabbed some kitchen paper to let the chicken dry from the excess of oil as she continued speaking. 

"Well of course, Kensei is not one who seeks for mindless minions.-
5623 2018-11-22 15:47:43 Que les pasa? A mi me ha pasado lo mismo, un señor con su coche comiéndome el coco y yo stop o te tiro la gasolina por la cabeza. Que por cierto! En Autonet&Oil hacemos BlackFriday amigos, 3cnts mas barata de lo habitual! En mallorca Frente Ikea, en C/Poima, e Inca. Mos veim!
5624 2018-11-22 15:47:40 Ungrateful takers Ont & Que. For the past 10 years Alberta’s Oil Industry has given Ottawa tens of Billions in Equalization payments which they give to “Have Not Provinces”
Ont & Que have been designated “Have Not”
Go ahead deny, pretend it didn’t happen keep buy Saudi & US Oil
5625 2018-11-22 15:47:30 I would not expect the US to follow suit. Cancelling the arms sale would cost somewhere around $400 billion and thousands of jobs. Saudi Arabia could also jack up oil prices and push the US into recession. The ICC should indict the Prince if they have the evidence.
5626 2018-11-22 15:47:29 We buy most of our oil from Canada. He owes the Saudis personal debts. How is he still squatting in the Oval Office?
5627 2018-11-22 15:47:29 Pm in #calgary today ! 
Addressing the chamber of commerce about market access for Alberta oil .
Likely going to good news with the feds back against the wall imo . 
They know they need Alberta to bail out the rest of Canada 
5628 2018-11-22 15:47:25 Thank you very much for resolving this issue. Our oil change has now been covered. Much appreciated!
5629 2018-11-22 15:47:21 Exactly,  as as long as he served in the military he can not use the “politician” excuse,  he knew better,  he knew to our country over politics and decided to sell his soul (and all of ours) for OIL!  To take the heat off the Saudi thing and direct it to the border!

5631 2018-11-22 15:47:04 If you want to make some people sweat bullets about selling Jamal Khashoggi out for oil I have a suggestion - do nothing on Friday, no shopping, no Amazon, no retail madness #JusticeForJamal,#JusticeForKhashoggi,#journalism
5632 2018-11-22 15:47:03 I thought it was common sense that milk of magnesia wasn’t a primer considering the fact that it’s literally medicine why would you think that’s a good idea do your research there are good primers out there and coconut oil is not a damn moisturizer
5633 2018-11-22 15:47:02 So the pipeline is still an "if"?  Again - I thought @JustinTrudeau and @RachelNotley were going to get TMX built?  Why does it matter who buys our oil?  It's currently landlocked and trades at a -$40 differential because of that.
5634 2018-11-22 15:46:33 We did not attack Saddam Hussein because he killed his own people.  We did it to get access to a stable supply of Middle East oil.  Again, cheap gas over human lives.
5635 2018-11-22 15:46:21 The problem you're having is not understanding both things can be accurate. That the weather always fluctuates and that humans are having a negative impact on it. I just think it's crazy to believe the 5% like the big oil and Republicans over the rest of the world and scientists
5636 2018-11-22 15:46:13 Government support for news media undergoing digital transformation = wrong; government support for oil and gas sector facing global uncertainty = right and necessary. Jason Kenny.
5637 2018-11-22 15:46:13 What is there in Herald loot, please explain, the loot is as explained by bjp agent in cag about 2g, coal, oil rate, doller excallation during upa and propaganda by namo and battalion also you. You people think that Indians are fool and Gujarati are only wise
5638 2018-11-22 15:46:12 He does not control oil prices..but he certeinly has influence on them..but i bet you are way stupid to find out yourself..
5639 2018-11-22 15:46:11 Pompeo didn't say those words in that way. Trying to make it sound like Pompeo said it that way is another of your lies  Go back to school and learn when to use quotation marks.  BTW: Money and oil is NOT more important than American values and human life.
5640 2018-11-22 15:46:10 You use an ingredient in your perfume which is considered by many in the cosmetics industry to be the best in the world, expensive too. Bulgarians have a centuries' old rose oil industry which is used by Chanel & Dior among others, as well as in organic beauty products
5641 2018-11-22 15:46:07 Low oil prices are not worth the life of journalists.
5642 2018-11-22 15:46:04 Yes, Palm Oil is bad for the destruction of tropical rainforests.. but it’s just being used as a scapegoat because nobody wants to talk about the real issue.. animal agriculture!!! STOP/reduce meat consumption!!
5643 2018-11-22 15:46:00 US/NATO: total joke
Turkey's a nato state
When isis was refining stolen oil for the black market, it went to Turkey
What did Obama do?
Nothing
What'd the US msm - right AND left - say?
Nothing

When it comes to isis, that old tech spam line comes to mind;

"Think different"
5644 2018-11-22 15:45:55 Oil price was suppressed to punish Russia but the result turned out the opposite. Russians modified their budget for $40/Barrell and now they have a huge surplus for infrastructure upgrades. Now uncle Sam and his Saudi stooge want to help boost the Iranian fiscal position.
5645 2018-11-22 15:45:51 WE are the worlds largest producer of oil, our largest importer is  around 40%. We import about 12% of our oil from the Saudies. We sell them weapon systems (around 150B, not 400B) systems are not interchangeable, they can’t just start buying  or .  owes them  not
5646 2018-11-22 15:45:50 @Duanaelise I have Nerd Name Homework to turn in! My ex-SIL's brother & his wife have a new baby boy named...Drexel. "Like the drug store?" "That reminds me of a brand name for oil." "Isn't that the name of a drill or a tool or something?" "No, you're thinking dremmel tool."
5647 2018-11-22 15:45:46 You're talking about two different things. Internet regulation requires passing new laws.

He's talking about using existing anti-trust laws to break up big tech companies. Like was done with Standard Oil under Teddy Roosevelt.

No new legislation required.
5648 2018-11-22 15:45:45 @JesseBrown lack of coverage on the oil spill out east is disturbing. On your radar?
5649 2018-11-22 15:45:44 A man has been killed; dismembered. And if all he can think about is the price of oil, then may God be with all journalist around the world.
5650 2018-11-22 15:45:36 Oil prices collapsed in 2014 and since then the exchange has been at least 20% lower which is great for our exporters and provided a huge tailwind for our economy.
5651 2018-11-22 15:45:36 Oil companies knew about this in 1965 and did nothing.  actually, "did nothing" is incorrect.  They have done everything they could to confuse the public, to cast doubt on climate science, to influence and buy politicians.  We had 50 years to make the change to renewable energy.

5656 2018-11-22 15:45:12 Does everyone in the UK coma back from lunch angry at crude oil? 13:00 = time to sell crude.
5657 2018-11-22 15:45:10 Cuales son estos tratados de los que hablas? La razon por la que el crudo baja es por el shale oil. Y las barreras a china son proteccionistas (se puede argumentar que justificadas, dada las violaciones a los derechos de p intelectual de los chinos).

5660 2018-11-22 15:45:02 The joke is clear... you whine about oil and Fukushima is still dumping radiation into the ocean for 7 yrs... pick your battles patrick...  one wrong move of the land and our nuclear reactors are going to melt our country.
5661 2018-11-22 15:44:48 Thou shall not murder, unless you have oil.  

Thou shall not commit adultery, unless you are rich, oppose abortion, and are willing to appoint conservative Supreme Court Justices.

Thou shall not lie, unless you promise to build walls.

5662 2018-11-22 15:44:46 Baking soda is to the Americans as Palm oil is to the Nigerians. Each must be in everything.
5663 2018-11-22 15:44:43 That's so amazing! The awareness that Iceland have raised in this past few weeks alone is worth it as well.  Even if people forget about it as time goes on, they've succeeded in making people and business so much more aware of the palm oil issue.
5664 2018-11-22 15:44:42 I am speaking on the part oil revenue shares in our tax structure. I bet it’s substantial. We know oil is not only used in cars. Other revenues derived because of oil.
5665 2018-11-22 15:44:40 I think people do it bc what could go wrong? A 20-30 piece of meat & a vat of hot oil.
I live here, & I don’t get it.
5666 2018-11-22 15:44:34 So its ok for a country to murder and dismember a US citizen so we can have lower oil prices?  How do you sleep at night knowing you have sold yourself to horrible people?

5669 2018-11-22 15:44:20 So, I am realizing that gringos didn't know their government start wars in third world countries, just to sell weapons and put dictators to secure oil or coal or gold...do they think we have nuclear weapons to fight back?
5670 2018-11-22 15:44:15 Hey so you are aware that with new technology you need to drill far fewer holes to get the oil right.  I am sure you do, so why are are you misleading Albertans?
5671 2018-11-22 15:44:13 My gran always told me to make sure the oil is as hot as possible.
5672 2018-11-22 15:44:13 There are just two things that can cure any sickness or injury in this Nigeria.

5675 2018-11-22 15:43:52 Cocaine suspended in olive oil - veey strange phenomenon. Drug smugglers keep inventing new source of carrier. Must congratulate Portugal police for the arrest.
5676 2018-11-22 15:43:41 Lowered oil prices by protecting Saudi murderers?  No thank you.  I'd rather have my dignity and the values America USED to protect.
5677 2018-11-22 15:43:41 In summary, you personally have worked hard to look the other way when one of your family business allies orders the murder of an AMERICAN journalist and you pretend that it’s worth it for low gas prices. Canada supplies the US will about half of our oil, BTW. #fakesaccrifice
5678 2018-11-22 15:43:40 There’s good business support and bad business support. We’re giving billions to oil companies to make even bigger profits... 
and an artificially low business tax rate is a corporate subsidy, we can’t play race the US to the bottom on tax rates
5679 2018-11-22 15:43:40 I’m certain that Jamal Khashoggi would have volunteered to be the Saudis’ science project for the sake of lower oil prices
5680 2018-11-22 15:43:34 Update: I'm using coconut oil to try and whiten my teeth. I been doing  it for two weeks so far, I've seen some results, I'm a big coffee drinker btw,  but haven't gotten the desired results just yet.
5681 2018-11-22 15:43:17 Like the children ripped from their moms by your husbands admin.
Or Khashoggi's family.
Or the Yemeni who are forgotten and dying because Trump likes to make people think we have lower oil prices #bloodmoney

5682 2018-11-22 15:43:08 Just two questions Sonya. Of all these diligently completed pipelines during the 10 yrs of the previous fed gov., how many are delivering to a customer other than US? And what is the discount on oil shipped by pipeline to that same self sufficient US?
5683 2018-11-22 15:43:08 中学生の時と今とで､外見も内面も考えてることもあんまり変わってないよ～笑
5684 2018-11-22 15:43:06 We don’t get our oil from the Mideast. The majority of our oil is domestic or comes from Canada. Perhaps you should study up. We aren’t going to be swayed by your stupidity.
5685 2018-11-22 15:43:06 We don’t need Saudi oil. We have more than they do so why would you say something like that? Perhaps you’d just like to see gas prices higher??
5686 2018-11-22 15:43:00 its a fucked up market w/cnbc assholes blowing smoke & the idiot
trump bashing oil prices...just throw fundimentals out the window &
you trust cant the charts cuz of crazy volatility breaking support levels
then bouncing back. I'm going slow waydown on my trading rest of the year
5687 2018-11-22 15:42:58 I’m sure nuking all the refineries after you nuke all the gun owners will have some effect on oil prices
5688 2018-11-22 15:42:58 KSA will probably go to China rather than Russia. China needs the oil, will close eyes to anything MBS needs to do to keep in power and could leverage KSA effectively against US.
5689 2018-11-22 15:42:52 There should be big rallies organized in support for oil but there is nothing , so I guess we loose it nobody cares
5690 2018-11-22 15:42:52 Lmao i will be frying water and baking red oil. You are welcome.
5691 2018-11-22 15:42:50 Equatorial Guinea congratulates international oil services companies TechnipFMC and Schlumberger for their proactive steps towards local content compliance in Equatorial Guinea...
5692 2018-11-22 15:42:47 The USA is a bigger oil producer than Saudi Arabia and your adoptive country Russia.

5698 2018-11-22 15:42:23 We're in the middle of the Sixth Great Extinction.... and an oil company put their dinosaur logo as a Macy's parade Balloon. 

There's got to be a German word for laughing nihilistically as you witness a tableau that exemplifies our ongoing destruction.
5699 2018-11-22 15:42:18 Any chance you can tell me what type of oil the beard comb was treated with? It seems to be fading and I'd like to retreat it with the same stuff.
5700 2018-11-22 15:42:18 Sure, sure. I'm just musing on possibly answers to Jim's question. It's a good one; why tolerate horrible people in one place with oil but not another place with oil? It can't be "democracy!", Iran actually holds regular presidential elections.
5701 2018-11-22 15:42:16 Snake oil salesmen , often lose their poise , when challenged by disbelievers !
5702 2018-11-22 15:42:04 Someone else told me@fish oil capsules... wtf are those lol...

5705 2018-11-22 15:41:43 Rick you cannot debate someone if u can’t agree on facts...Trump counts on this...Facts Saudis have killed the most Americans in Terrorist attacks, Fact we only import maybe 10-11% of r Oil from Saudi, Fact Majority of r imported oil comes from Canada, But his base will disagree
5706 2018-11-22 15:41:42 is that oil brand oil? i can't believe you're springing for that

5708 2018-11-22 15:41:40 So Lower oil prices is more important than an American Journalist being brutally murdered?
5709 2018-11-22 15:41:36 Wasn't he warning Germany about bring dependent on Russian oil? 
5710 2018-11-22 15:41:33  just add some mayonnaise or oil.
5711 2018-11-22 15:41:29 I know we are working on new technology. Again it must show ease of use and cost effectiveness. New technology may decrease the use of oil a bit but I don’t think it replaces it
5712 2018-11-22 15:41:18 Мне понравилось видео "Новая печка на отработке,ни грамма сварки.Use of waste oil in
5713 2018-11-22 15:41:15 Yea  I have a bachelors degree in studio art - focus was on life draw and oil painting 
5714 2018-11-22 15:41:10 This week @AlociLtd delivered an emergency response exercise with our client, to raise awareness of the hazards of #UXO near #oil and #gas #pipelines with experts in attendance from @RamoraUK
5715 2018-11-22 15:41:05 He said gasoline, not home heating oil
5716 2018-11-22 15:41:01 That is cutting off your nose to spite your face. One it wouldn’t hurt trump. Two you don’t give us your oil for free. Three it would hurt innocent Americans.
5717 2018-11-22 15:40:58 God knows the good burgers of any Ohio town would lose their shit if a oil pipeline was going to be shoved under their potable water supply, or if there was a well moneyed assault on laws that protected their kids from being adopted and placed outside their culture
5718 2018-11-22 15:40:57 So de- marketing decreased the price of crude oil which is our only source forieng exchange, and even when we import everything including pencils and tooth picks. Na wa oh.

5720 2018-11-22 15:40:50 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Dallas sleeps.
5721 2018-11-22 15:40:50 Stay tuned folks . Could see some huge news today in  oil/gas 
5722 2018-11-22 15:40:50 1am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
5723 2018-11-22 15:40:44 comme dans beaucoup de mouvements il y a toujours une minorité qui fou la merde. Le soucis est dû aussi à l’urbanisme, à la sociologie. on a poussé lee gens à s’installer en zone périurbaine sans faire de transport. le pick oil on est en train de l’atteindre
5724 2018-11-22 15:40:37 Bullshit, we are the largest oil producer in the world and a small percent of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia. Much more from Mexico and Canada. The story is your role in the torture and murder of a journalist and American resident
5725 2018-11-22 15:40:36 Trump patting himself on the back for low oil prices.  Says he's been maliciously panned in press for causing traffic jams because he got the oil price so low

Completely reversing reasoning behind Trump Administration policy against fuel efficient cars.
5726 2018-11-22 15:40:36 Grateful for my mom who’s teaching my grandmother about cbd oil
5727 2018-11-22 15:40:35 With oil prices tanking again and 2 less pipelines than your budget depended on, how's that budget going? Let me guess, we can fix this problem by a) assuming oil prices will skyrocket, b) pipelines will materialize, and c) borrowing a buttload more money?
5728 2018-11-22 15:40:35 Watching it at my sister's for first time in ... decades? Ever?

I don't get it, either. Was okay with the entire thing until they rolled out the oil industry Dinosaur.

5731 2018-11-22 15:40:25 Which oil did you used?  It looks like olive oil
5732 2018-11-22 15:40:24 Dear Donald, 

I am going to carve the turkey today for the first time!!! 

How should I approach this? 

Bone saw? 

Do I send 6000 troops to my oven to make sure it doesn’t cross into my kitchen? 

Do I need to rake it’s ass to keep it from burning? 

Let me know, 

Snake Oil
5733 2018-11-22 15:40:22 He has influence on oil price..chew on that one..but i guess you stay clueless..
5734 2018-11-22 15:40:16 Trump continues to defend the Saudi’s overthe murder of a journalist. The truth about oil prices is America gets 40% of its oil from Canada. More than half comes from  domestic sources. As far Saudi’s & weapons purchases Trump lies again. They are buying 14 million that’s it
5735 2018-11-22 15:40:16 祝う祝う〜

5738 2018-11-22 15:40:04 Your just another coastal dipwad that knows nothing about the oil and gas industry. So Michael educate yourself before you speak .. It will go a long whys in hiding you lack of knowledge on a subject. Just saying.
5739 2018-11-22 15:40:00 It’s all about controlling the Middle East which no one either can or wants to be a part of. Nothing to do with oil. Realize terrorist attacks are non existent since siding with the Saudi’s. It’s a control game. Problem is Saudi Arabia does not want to be told what to do.
5740 2018-11-22 15:39:57 smart cats know that when the Donald breathes heavily, a sad wolf has brainfreeze #impeach
5741 2018-11-22 15:39:50 On November 11th Saudi Arabia cut oil production dramatically.
They did this to raise the price of oil.
Trump let them get away with a gruesome senseless murder to make money he called them out friends.
They are not our friends. And trump is stupid.
5742 2018-11-22 15:39:44 Trump thinks we blame the holiday traffic on him because he and the Saudis have lowered oil/gas prices.
5743 2018-11-22 15:39:41 車庫いれようとしたらやっぱり急斜面じゃけリップ擦って萎え
5744 2018-11-22 15:39:35 We get it. You bear-hugged a regime that ordered the murder and dismemberment of a journalist and American resident because of money and oil. Happy Thanksgiving.
5745 2018-11-22 15:39:32 I’m making Brussels sprouts today, Joy! No bacon or onion, but I’m roasting them with olive oil & honey and then will stir in dried cranberries & balsamic vinegar
5746 2018-11-22 15:39:30 Bruh Gamabunta can dodge that single attack with ease. He also has Toad Oil Bullet and Water Release.
5747 2018-11-22 15:39:28 Yes Mr president you and your butcher friends are sure selling alot of crude oil isn't that just great where is the parts of the body your friends butchered don't you think that his family at least deserve that or is oil more important
5748 2018-11-22 15:39:27 All three made a bundle off this oil thing. Now there is a glut on the market and the price has dropped. One thing I'm wondering is how are the big oil companies handling this price drop.
5749 2018-11-22 15:39:27 Fcuk away off sparky ya big oil tanker ya sure you fcuked off into the wilderness there for 2yrs ffs I was that worried about you I had the north Belfast mouth hilti asking your relatives about your well being
5750 2018-11-22 15:39:23 Hello there @TunnockOfficial, please would you be able to point me in the right direction? Trying to find out if Tunnocks use sustainable Palm oil? Many thanks!
5751 2018-11-22 15:39:23 Zimbos obsession with cooking oil is just mad.. shopping has become so unpleasant

5753 2018-11-22 15:39:15 Def yes to preheating oil but batter is going to be room temp
5754 2018-11-22 15:39:14 The fake news is blaming him for traffick jams.. not Trump.
While he does not control oil prices he certeinly has influence on the oil prices lol
5755 2018-11-22 15:39:09 So you want smooth talking no matter if what they are saying is like a snake oil salesman?  Ridiculous to think bc one is a polished speaker he/she is a good leader and has the country’s best interest at heart.
5756 2018-11-22 15:38:59 Actually it was a combination of incompetent FNMI consultations by the former @CPC_HQ  and 40 years of @PC_Alberta (now defunct) selling oil exclusively to one customer that now has buckets of cheap shale oil.  But hey keep lying and hanging out with extremists.
5757 2018-11-22 15:38:56 Really rude that you have to get your oil changed every 3 months but okay

5760 2018-11-22 15:38:44 You're contributing to the mean and nasty part, and nothing else. Thank Canada for the oil.
5761 2018-11-22 15:38:37 Bahahaha! All of this! I thought I was going to die during my hot yoga class, I had to step out for 5 minutes to get air lol ... at the end when we laid down with cool wash clothes while the instructor gave us a little neck massage with lavender oil I thought I was in heaven 
5762 2018-11-22 15:38:31 "pass me the oil"
5763 2018-11-22 15:38:29 Oh last thing.  I don't use a moisturiser.  Instead, I mix jojoba oil with a few drops of tea tree, rosemary and lavender/peppermint essential oil and rub that into my skin morning and night after washing. Read on oil cleansing.
5764 2018-11-22 15:38:28 He is by not doing anything. He’s justifying it because they bought some bombs & we only get 11% of oil from them (we dont need em, U forget 9/11) This is about human rights hes normalizing things like this, thats not okay-Saudis are trash & your USA 1st president is full of sh*t
5765 2018-11-22 15:38:26 Turn off the oil taps for a week. Will he notice?
5766 2018-11-22 15:38:24 @realDonaldTrump pompeo: Saudis are improving w/human rights, what's he smoking or is he lying for you. khashoggi, 2 saudi sisters, all 3 likely Salman's doing, that's not improvement. lower oil prices because they're bribing you.  No arms deals w/them, pull salman.
5767 2018-11-22 15:38:23 went to a nissan dealer w alexa yesterday to get our oil changed and stuff and it was the first time in my life ive ever gotten a car checked up on and not had to get anything extra done
5768 2018-11-22 15:38:22 It wasn't bad actually, really quite tasty. It was packet rice so has a little oil on it, and I doused it in Worcester sauce. I'll have a look at that book but I'm "not doing a diet"
5769 2018-11-22 15:38:12 Why wld u Arnab, debate this #Brahmans issue, one day after the silly jack twitter debate?!? Feeding oil to the fire to aid CONgress?
5770 2018-11-22 15:38:12 It was a good investment.  I am sure a lot of social programs would not exist if not for oil revenue. Oil is the lifeblood.
5771 2018-11-22 15:38:12 Whats ur point? For real make a point. I am arguing that making it so that cars get 50+ mpg in the future is a good thing for the environment, our health and our dependence on oil, aka National Security. And the Co.'s were onboard with it  Your point is "troll the libtard."???
5772 2018-11-22 15:38:11 @worldflood1 blood for oil
5773 2018-11-22 15:37:58 We subsidized oil and road construction...for the good of the people.  We can do it again.  I am reminded of my younger sister who at a young age declared all food that she did not like unhealthy.....
5774 2018-11-22 15:37:56 Hahaha aww a dinosaur balloon! Haha! It’s repping an oil company! Haha! The pipeline in South Dakota leaked! Hahaha!
5775 2018-11-22 15:37:47 Kassian definitely thought he sent a message.

5778 2018-11-22 15:37:45 I shifted fast food and clogged peoples' arteries. That was back when trans fat was just called "fryer oil", too.

If you are born into circumstances where working for evil employers is the only way to get fed, you are hardly culpable. Do more good now that you're free(-er).
5779 2018-11-22 15:37:44 +RUMP is the ultimate male Wizard of Oz character...all four rolled into one: no brains, no heart, no courage and a charlatan selling snake oil to gullible followers.
5780 2018-11-22 15:37:44 Deny Deny  What Fools Ont & Que when you fill up your buying Foreign Oil & Gas.
Ridiculous to say we don’t buy foreign oil, there private corps? Then you’re fruits an veggies aren’t foreign cause they’re imported by  private corps Now that’s Stupidity. We have oil & no Pipeline
5781 2018-11-22 15:37:42 Does this 'frictionless' trade deal mean they're going to keep selling our oil for us?
5782 2018-11-22 15:37:31 Prices are low because there is a surplus of oil thank you POTUS.  Gas prices fluctuate daily due disruptions in oil supplies, operations at refineries and gas deliveries.  Deliveries can be delayed due to weather.  Gas was lower under BO because he opened up our reserves.
5783 2018-11-22 15:37:21 Imma burn the midnight oil again
5784 2018-11-22 15:37:15 @FatKidDeals can you help the kid locate a good deal on a oil diffuser I seen one the other day on here but can’t seem to find it
5785 2018-11-22 15:37:09 Thanks Canada for cheaper oil...we get 40% of our oil from them and only 10% from Saudi
5786 2018-11-22 15:37:07 u’d think cooking is smth everyone can do but rly it isn’t like it rly doesn’t come naturally to everyone ive seen ppl cook w/o considering using condiments (like u gotta plan the flavour and work backwards to recr8) or without flipping the meat or without even using oil
5787 2018-11-22 15:36:59 Regret spraying oil on the fan now my room smells like motorbike workshop already
5788 2018-11-22 15:36:55 Here in Texas we just peaked as the largest provider of oil, so there’s that..
5789 2018-11-22 15:36:49 มึงนางเอกเป่าปี่จนตายเหรอ น่ากลัวอะ

how long hv i been hre
wittejḨonL
5791 2018-11-22 15:36:42 OMG! Taking credit for low gas prices? We get about 10% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. But ignoring the IC that the Saudi Prince has a journalist murdered because you have deals with them is inexcusable.
5792 2018-11-22 15:36:42 Drone striking brown people and stealing oil? Fuck yeah! 'Murican values!
5793 2018-11-22 15:36:38 This is nothing. I know people who use palm oil and rice water.
5794 2018-11-22 15:36:28 Girllll, look up pernil. It’s like the most genius way to cook meat that I’ve ever seen.

I just did a beer brine two nights before (Tuesday night) and then Wednesday I did the garlic/oil mix but I also added herbs and the sazon 

You won’t regret it, I swear
5795 2018-11-22 15:36:24 The world?!? It’s pretty easy to see who to blame. The hell with Saudi Arabia! Just get our oil from Canada. Oh wait, Trump pissed them off. Such a great business man. How many times has he gone bankrupt?
5796 2018-11-22 15:36:24 you have to consider that the Saudis learned from what happened with Big Oil, and GOP politics especially (the Texas mafia) in Iran and knew they had to have protection...I think your speculations have merit.
5797 2018-11-22 15:36:23 How much public money gets dumped into subsidizing oil production in Canada each year? Isn’t it something like $2 billion? Genuine question:
5798 2018-11-22 15:36:16 @realDonaldTrump loves the traffic jams due to cheap oil. Thanks Saudi Arabia for cheap oil and the traffic jams. But your grisly murder of a journalist is something the world will never forget.  #FreePress
5799 2018-11-22 15:36:07 olive oil......an angel
5800 2018-11-22 15:36:07 Trump: "China is paying us billions of dollars(now) and soon billions and billions more". Show us the money, moron. Snake oil. Cheesy snake oil salesman. How can you buy that, America? How?!
5801 2018-11-22 15:36:00 Do you preheat the oil in the pan and pour in chilled batter?
5802 2018-11-22 15:35:51 Grape seed oil is believed to enhance hair growth. Give your scalp a massage using this oil before bedtime.
5803 2018-11-22 15:35:41 Yep....guess you will then have to annex BC to get your oil to tide water?
5804 2018-11-22 15:35:41 It’s not Trump that killed the oil industry, it’s Obama that killed our oil industry. I was just hoping Trump would be pro oil like Bush, but I guess I was wrong!!
5805 2018-11-22 15:35:35 I have 15 oz of chickpeas or black beans a day, which I add Flax oil to. Plus 16 oz of asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, or spinach per day.  And 3-5 oz macadamia nuts. Because I'm "fasting" 20 hours a day, my morning blood glucose remains ~ 85 mg/dL.

#macysthanksgivingdayparade
5808 2018-11-22 15:35:20 They have solar panels that can make power more efficiently but that tech cannot be released because no one would need oil its very sad
5809 2018-11-22 15:35:20 So Don, you're telling us that Saudi Arabia is lowering oil prices to "buy off" your continued support of MBS & his murdering? I think the press hates this murdering more than you & MBS do.
5810 2018-11-22 15:35:15 I love deep fried turkey! But I didn’t feel like digging out the big frier, checking if the Turk would fit then buying a couple gallons of oil lol, and I haven’t used my smoker much lately
5811 2018-11-22 15:35:14 I’ve been thinking this for a while: Trump’s preoccupation with oil prices is part of a worldview forged in the 1980s.
5812 2018-11-22 15:35:08 @drharshvardhan @narendramodi @JPNadda  Cultivation n extensive use of Palm oil in eateries,domestic use is reportedly hazardous for environment and public health.Plz review the policy.
5813 2018-11-22 15:35:06 Make sure to mix it very well before each use too We don't use palm oil in our products so there's nothing in place to keep the natural nut oil and nut solids binded together. I recommend using a blunt knife to mix the product back together
5814 2018-11-22 15:35:04 Half these people pay to have their oil changed
5815 2018-11-22 15:35:02 A team who all have their noses in the oil / coal / auto industries....
5816 2018-11-22 15:35:02 You really believe this lie? Lower oil is driven by world events not your pushing. Furthermore, if you really understood the industry you'd know current prices are HURTING US oil industry, costing jobs & playing directly into Saudi hands. Oh wait, maybe that's what you want.
5817 2018-11-22 15:35:00 I’m thankful on this day for everyone who sees the fraud this President is. During the same press conference he gave cover and deflection for the Saudi crown prince and claimed the CIA said he might not have been aware, but praise me for low oil prices and their billions in cash.
5818 2018-11-22 15:34:58 Shell stopping oil drilling, stopping persecuting Nigerian activists, stopping fracking, and not championing gas as 'low carbon' would be a start. #climatebreakdown
5819 2018-11-22 15:34:57 PSA
Dropping a frozen turkey into a vat of boiling oil will cause explosively propelled oil everywhere.
5820 2018-11-22 15:34:48 I guess Saudi Arabia is giving us a deal since you are covering for them for the murder of the journalist.  You haven’t mentioned oil prices in 2 years until now.  I know you want us to forget about a murdered journalist.
5821 2018-11-22 15:34:47 @JACM0313 Hey #ineptpotus   ,America could give a shit about "Billions of Dollars of purchases made in U.S., big Jobs & Oil!" 
Our values come first! What you are doing totally goes against those values. It's like taking a bribe, or "looking" the other way!
Shape up or Ship out!
5822 2018-11-22 15:34:41 Who cares about this murder - this is between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, it does not pertain to Americans or America. President Trump is correct by thinking of America first and OUR Economy keeping oil prices down
5823 2018-11-22 15:34:33 Again, we subsidized oil....so the will is lacking.
5824 2018-11-22 15:34:28 You really put the "Twit" in Twitter! You have done everything to destabilize the stock market, sticking speculators with billions of gallons of oil, creating a glut, the price per barrel plummets, forcing lower prices at the pump! We need to return to the gold standard, instead!
5825 2018-11-22 15:34:26 So if you check the price at the pump to the fall in current cost, you will probably find the saving to the consumer is far less than it should be. The oil companies are certain to make a nice profit from the drop in wholesale prices, they always do.
5826 2018-11-22 15:34:25 Oil  prices are lower not bc of SA but bc Trump’s tariffs, trade wars and Fed. Chief have created a recession risk killing demand .
5827 2018-11-22 15:34:24 Brussels sprouts are halved, drizzled in olive oil, sprinkled with real bacon and coarse black pepper and roasted. It is an abomination to put them in mac & cheese.
5828 2018-11-22 15:34:20 Notley NDP-Trudeau Liberal ‘management’ of our oil & gas economy over the last 3.5 years helped bring us to the crisis we face today. But Premier Notley is now promising the NDP is the one to bring us out of this mess. #ableg #abpoli #ucp #cdnpoli #cpc #abndp
5829 2018-11-22 15:34:01 How to refresh a mattress? Add a few drops of essential oil to baking soda, mix, sprinkle on, and one hour later, vacuum off.
5830 2018-11-22 15:34:00 Perfect now you can tell the globalists that control you and Trudeau that since Canada has so much oil we can lower it even further. But helping with the tax burden doesn't fit in with your "elite" agenda. Soon you will all be exposed. I'd get out while you still can. Hot potato
5831 2018-11-22 15:33:54 Who cares about this murder - this is between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, it does not pertain to Americans or America. President Trump is correct by thinking of America first and OUR Economy keeping oil prices down.
5832 2018-11-22 15:33:54 Hey numnut! We don't get most of oil from Saudi Arabia! But then again if you paid attention during your briefings you would know!
5833 2018-11-22 15:33:54 Yay @BruceSallan  Canada provides more oil to the US (40%) than Saudi Arabia yet the man in the White House is more concerned with relations with Saudi Arabia for their oil.
5834 2018-11-22 15:33:48 Is better than what is happening  currently there. You people should remove your eyes on Niger Delta oil.
5835 2018-11-22 15:33:38 Shoutout to oil, allowing me to discreetly smoke in plain site without raising suspicion
5836 2018-11-22 15:33:36 Alberta oil showed on the market at over $18 a bbl this morning.
5837 2018-11-22 15:33:35 NOTE TO SELF. Don't drink chili oil, ever again.
5838 2018-11-22 15:33:27 Presidents are NEVER responsible for oil prices.  You would know that if you didn't push lies all the time.

5840 2018-11-22 15:33:23 The price of oil was $53 a barrel in Jan 2017. Trump, Russia and the Saudis then drove it up to $82 a barrel. Trump didn't want the blame for the price of oil going up, but now he is whining that he's not getting the credit for it being at $54.47, higher than when he took office.
5841 2018-11-22 15:33:23 Stop with the No Palm Oil and try ‘No non-sustainably sourced Palm Oil’
5842 2018-11-22 15:33:22 Here America Is Putting Their Interests First.
Few Days Ago Trump Mentioned That If We Put Sanctions On Saudia, Oil Prices will Increase so We Don't Want To Ruin World Economy.
America First is Trump's Policy
@JustinTrudeau Has Also Listened The Tapes As Per Foreign Office Canada
5843 2018-11-22 15:33:21 ¿Sabes que eres toxico?
5844 2018-11-22 15:33:17 Trump: 'it was very violent, very vicious, terrible' (death recorded journalist screaming) Later: 'it is what it is'  Now: 'Oil prices getting lower..thank you to Saudi Arabia'.     
IT IS TIME WE DECIDE WHAT KIND OF HUMAN LEADS OUR NATION.
5845 2018-11-22 15:33:12 We finally know the cost of an American’s life. Per DJT, please Saudi Arabia torture and kill another one, just be sure to lower oil $1.00/bbl. all good then. What a disgrace!
5846 2018-11-22 15:33:04 Drain of oil and put back in oven to crisp up. Add herbs and spices at this point.
5847 2018-11-22 15:33:03 “It’s, Middle East. This, America’s.” @SecPompeo  I. In, Billions Dollars U.S., Jobs Oil!
5848 2018-11-22 15:33:01 Interesting discussion, and the blog link is very insightful as well. Everyone’s focused on supply dynamics, but what about demand? Could oil move recently portend a collapse in forward demand, signaling a recession in China for example?

5850 2018-11-22 15:32:56 Got to use the right potatoe first. I like Maris Piper. par boil. In a baking tray I first heat up oil, rapeseed oil is great for roast potatoes, and butter (feel free to use flavoured I.e garlic) once hot and smoking I throw in my potatoes and put in oven. No cover. Once cooked.
5851 2018-11-22 15:32:51 @Nick_Felixx Why oil tanked
5852 2018-11-22 15:32:51 He’s so full of shit here. Saudi Arabia has virtually nothing to do with global gas prices. The US is the world’s largest exporter of oil. Saudi Arabia is making deals with Kushner and trump and that’s the only reason he won’t act. He’s nothing but a con man, wake up trump people
5853 2018-11-22 15:32:50 Because the prince didn't have him killed. DS/CIA killed Jamal. In attemps to divide U.S. Saudi relationship. 1 result from that would've been crude over 100.00/bbl. Which would crippled the country due to Saudi Arabia cutting  the oil supply and going to China &or Russia.
5854 2018-11-22 15:32:43 It’s not real bad bald just kinda thin there but i do oil it just waiting it out
5855 2018-11-22 15:32:42 Hey Mr Trump we are the #1 oil producer and get most of our oil from Canada. Only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
5856 2018-11-22 15:32:42 Were JD Rockefeller still with us he would reconstitute Standard Oil and tell the government "Make My Day, punks"
5857 2018-11-22 15:32:35 Fuel prices are low because of technology that allows more oil extraction inside the U.S. I didn't know you were a hydrologist and geologist too. Did you pick up that degree at Trump Univ in Pleasure CA?
5858 2018-11-22 15:32:33 I think you can get the money elsewhere, cut off the oil ties, use our own oil and get people in electric cars.  No business with men in dresses please.  These fucks are shady all the way around.  We've made there royalty.  They were dirt people before us.
5859 2018-11-22 15:32:14 But Pepe the frog on his page is consistent with a Trump racist troll. And the Russian trolls are amplifying that term. Has Putin decided to get into the Tony Robbins scam? Make a frew Rubbles on the side with the low oil prices?
5860 2018-11-22 15:32:08 #Germany and #Denmark say they will stop selling arms to #SaudiArabia. Hello, #Washington??  Saudi Arabla is a SMALL trading partner and NOT a major source of oil for the US either. #Canada supplies more oil to the US. And crooked @POTUS can't be nice to them. Why
5861 2018-11-22 15:32:04 Remember amateurs, when frying the turkey less oil is more oil when it’s hot.
5862 2018-11-22 15:32:04 Alternate playbook is the petro dollar threat => oil producing state threatens oil trading in non-dollar currency. USD move has been to brand state leader as threat, invade or destroy regime. That’s more of what we’re seeing against BTC. Accusations of terror funding etc.

5864 2018-11-22 15:31:53 In 2017, Ogun generated 74bn as IGR which translates to 6.2bn NGN monthly. In 2018, it targets 10b which is 120b in 1yr.With a 402bn budget, clearly it’s a deficit, with fluctuating oil prices, only way out is to borrow. Borrowing for infrastructure is good but not to pay salary!
5865 2018-11-22 15:31:42 Why didn't you getting your Army back from NASTY MIDDLE EAST Mr. President @POTUS? 

Why do you still allowing @SecPompeo to Support, Arm, Fund, Airdrop, Airlift ISIS/AQ in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Libya?

Why your LOOTED OIL became your Security demolishing HUMANITY & MANKIND?

5867 2018-11-22 15:31:23 The REAL STORY is, Trump caved in to Saudi Arabia's denial of killing a journalist. The lower price of oil is just a side story to distract.
 Wait and see, the price of oil will be back up again soon and Trump will blame someone else for it, (Dem's).
5868 2018-11-22 15:31:13 And you are destroying our oil industry in Texas and many other states by promoting lower oil prices. That's OK cause Texas will vote for the Dems in 2020
5869 2018-11-22 15:31:12 I'm confident some, if not all, in his administration are fully aware of this obvious fact, but in an effort to save public face, will peddle the same lie about this having a thing to do with an arms deal, oil or applying pressure to Iran.
5870 2018-11-22 15:31:12 But the oil and guns and money, oh my.
5871 2018-11-22 15:31:07 5 hours and I recommend you fry that turkey inside and make sure you fill the fryer with oil all the way to the top BEFORE you put the turkey in.

5877 2018-11-22 15:30:48 You are telling it right, Mr. President... oil at &100 per barrel enriched dictators in Venezuela and others...
5878 2018-11-22 15:30:48 Politicians & Corporations have kept the world enslaved to fossil fuels as a means of maintaining power & control. If you control the oil, you control the world. Climate change denial has nothing to do with disbelieving the science. We're on to you!
5879 2018-11-22 15:30:46 aha! kasalanan pala ni mama eh, kinulang ako sa pahid ng baby oil
5880 2018-11-22 15:30:44 I found them on amazon - maybe add them to your wishlist. They're pretty awesome. There is also a bath oil which I have but am yet to try. May use it later as dislocated loads today =) good luck on your recovery!
5881 2018-11-22 15:30:37 Oil is the root of many of our problems. We know these problems can be solved with clean energy. The supporters of fossil fuels are fighting for their own greedy profits. What are we waiting for? Get involved in changing our reliance to renewable energy. @citizensclimate

5885 2018-11-22 15:30:28 I didn’t realize that you changed oil prices? Can you do something about the stock market????

5889 2018-11-22 15:30:14 We cannot be the police of the world. Many countries are horrible concerning human rights. I believe there should be a sanction against the prince. However, they are one of a handful of allies in the middle east and then there is that pesky thing called... oil.
5890 2018-11-22 15:30:10 “Maybe he did it maybe he didn’t” says @realDonaldTrump when the Saudi Prince is implicated in a grisly murder that the CIA says he most probably did. But DT says he loves traffic jams due to low oil prices! So thanks Saudi Arabia!!!
5891 2018-11-22 15:30:06 No. Our economy in Texas relies on oil.
5892 2018-11-22 15:30:06 We get it you have oil money
5893 2018-11-22 15:30:04 We could right now pull more oil out now an put the hurt on them.
5894 2018-11-22 15:30:03 Mann's the Hockey stick!!!   It's a damned shame that the oil companies knew the ramifications of climate change and decided to plow ahead with its destruction of the climate and muddy the waters and prevent definitive action to mitigate it.
5895 2018-11-22 15:30:03 who’s gunna give me rides when my engine seizes and my car gets fucked up bc my dad wont do my oil change
5896 2018-11-22 15:30:00 I’m trapped in an oil painting
5897 2018-11-22 15:29:59 Blood and oil have been connected for millions of years. From the blood of plants and beasts that went into making the sludge- to the blood of we semi-evolved simians that fight over it.

5900 2018-11-22 15:29:19 Sir you have done a great job. It is important to exercise control in order to maintain prices of oil and other products and services of necessities to reasonable level. You are charged with the responsibility to do in the interest of mankind??
5901 2018-11-22 15:29:18 Bout a billion for murder, plus they lowered oil prices. Welcome to Trumptopia.
5902 2018-11-22 15:29:14 But but but potus thanked Saudi Arabia yesterday for low oil prices!! ???
5903 2018-11-22 15:29:09 mom complaining that i’m such a baby when i whines and ask her to apply oil for my tummy, she still did it in the end  heh
5904 2018-11-22 15:29:02 He says hey Saudis  i supporting  you! kill who ever you want but keep oil price down and protect  my investments ..what the shame.any country  is guilty for murder any person or turcher what ever if they have benefits for any country Saudis always supported  terrorists
5905 2018-11-22 15:28:58 Is anybody watching Drumpf  on television? He's telephoning  troops all over the world. He pretends to understand things he does not, he mispronounces everything. Now, he says he's sucking up to the Saudis. These are a brutal and primitive people. But, if they didn't have oil ...
5906 2018-11-22 15:28:55 but do these other countries sell their oil for dollars only ? #petrodollars
5907 2018-11-22 15:28:51 To me, the resumption of inventory build (note it’s still above 10-yr averages) suggests to me either shale is growing much faster than expected, or non-OPEC, non-US is not declining as fast as expected (or mix of both). This case is what I think kills the oil bull thesis
5908 2018-11-22 15:28:46 They're all connected go check out u will find out somehow govt money is involved, bcos all the money spent in naija is from one source which is oil, & d govt control it, unless u want to tell us that there is a major  manufactural, Technological etc companies in d country now.
5909 2018-11-22 15:28:40 The Saudis were pumping more Oil to make up for the Shortfall that was supposed to come from the Iran sanctions,but no one is abiding by your sanctions,so the Oil kept selling, it is low in spite of you. You did cause some pot holes in the road, and the long lines at the grocery
5910 2018-11-22 15:28:40 For the first time, we are exporting oil and expanding are drilling. That brings down prices from overseas.

I started putting peppermint oil at the base of my skull to help with the nearly constant tension headaches, and it is amazing. I can skip meds most days!
5913 2018-11-22 15:28:34 A report worth reading. Fuel prices on the global scene are not expected to see any change in the next 12 months. If the reason for the #FuelPriceHike is a the depreciation of the Kwacha by .57% should it not have been offset by the gradual drop in crude oil prices??

5915 2018-11-22 15:28:23 @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC #CNN #FoxNews #MSNBC Fake News folks that @realDonaldTrump promotes... he is giving himself credit of lower gas prices but remember folks & it is a FACT! The President of United States or any leaders around the world do not dictate oil prices/gas prices.
5916 2018-11-22 15:28:21 “Gotten” FFS you must have missed out many of your English lessons when at school!  Also you have not influenced the oil price in any way.  #TrumpTotalDisgrace #DonTheCon

5919 2018-11-22 15:28:04 Saudi doesn’t provide the majority of crude oil to the US nor is the alleged weapons deal going to cost American jobs or what trump claims its worth. 

I forgot, gas prices are going up not down. Guess trump missed the memo?

5920 2018-11-22 15:28:04 Oil prices low under obama
5921 2018-11-22 15:27:57 Its because OPEC decided not to cut production and we have tons of oil we produce domestically it's nothing to do with @realDonaldTrump the OPEC countries laugh at this fool
5922 2018-11-22 15:27:55 counterpoint: palm oil is really bad
5923 2018-11-22 15:27:37 Canada is the largest supplier of oil to the United States. Far more than Saudi Arabia. Get your facts straight even if it isn't convenient for you.
5924 2018-11-22 15:27:31 Because, if we allow Saudi Arabia to slide into chaos that would come from ending support, it would collapse and the loss of oil production would cause a global recession or depression. Do you want to live in a world with $2-$3-$400 a barrel oil? I don’t
5925 2018-11-22 15:27:28 It has NOTHING to do with oil and arms. Donald Trump and his family are receiving significant sums of money from the Saudi Royal Family, and are very likely assured even more. I have zero doubts that Donald Trump's personal greed is what's currently dictating U.S. policy.
5926 2018-11-22 15:27:22 Hes literally bragging about the fact he is letting SA off the hook for murder so the US get cheaper oil. Literally bragging. He knows exactly was hes doing with this tweet. "I have all the power and theres nothing you can do about it'
5927 2018-11-22 15:27:22 Not a good way to start Thanksgiving... woke up to hear a babbling, ridiculous POTUS spewing nonsense. He sounds like he’s been drinking (though they say he doesn’t drink). Total lies! BTW, we only get 11% of oil from Saudi Arabia. We supply most of our own! Then Canada, at 30%.

5951 2018-11-22 15:26:01 It’s a fine day in America when corporations, money, tax cuts,  and lower oil prices are far more important than a life or the lives of its citizens.  @realDonaldTrump do the ends really justify the means???
5952 2018-11-22 15:26:01 In which they did not claim that oil prices relate to where US oil comes from? Read it again yourself.
5953 2018-11-22 15:26:01 The importance of data analysis has become apparent across all industries. According to Rosemary Freeman from @hesscorporation "soon there will be more data scientists than engineers in oil and gas—that's where technology is taking us #data #insight #analysis

5961 2018-11-22 15:25:42 This discount for Canadian oil they talk about is just what we call 'basis'.

5968 2018-11-22 15:25:21 @realDonaldTrump Maybe it is because you and your actions have absolutely NOTHING to do with oil prices. You are ridiculous for taking credit for traffic jams. Who does that?

5975 2018-11-22 15:24:58 You sold our soul for oil.
5976 2018-11-22 15:24:53 You realize there is plenty of private sector money for studies that would disprove global warming? You understand why e.g. oil companies are interested in studies that would show there isn't a problem with using oil?

5978 2018-11-22 15:24:38 Coconut will not  driving you nut - instead it's  Oil is come from nature Fruit & it's been use authenticity Cooking & as Hair Oil to grow Hair . And it  Asia to America coming back again as a Organic health benefits .
5979 2018-11-22 15:24:33 However the world market doesn’t care about Canadian oil when it sets prices, it looks at Saudi and Russian oil. So you may be the largest single supplier but you don’t set the price.
5980 2018-11-22 15:24:32 i literally over hear my mom and sister talking and hannah goes “should i use danielle’s vegan oil???” bitch it’s AVOCADO oil.
5981 2018-11-22 15:24:30 You did not “push” to lower gas prices. Oil is down b/c you didn’t sanction Iran as severely as you threatened, & world demand is down b/c of economic slowing (in part due to your trade wars). Last major drop in oil meant bankruptcies & layoffs in US energy. Recession is coming.
5982 2018-11-22 15:24:30 It is through good environmental governance that the key stakeholders (government, oil companies, local communities & citizen groups) will be able to perform their roles to ensure a healthy & sustainable environment.

5983 2018-11-22 15:24:29 Happy Thanksgiving to everyone. It’s my favorite holiday. If you are frying your turkey today, be careful. Don’t do it close to the house and pay attention to the temperature.  Oh, and thaw and dry the bird before you put it in the oil. Enjoy!! #ThanksgivingDay
5984 2018-11-22 15:24:29 U can stop buying products with palm oil and single use plastic no matter your diet!! Every little helps our environment these days and at least u are trying! I know veganism is overall the best for the environment but leave people help whatever way they can without judgment!!!!
5985 2018-11-22 15:24:29 Who’s going to tell him that if the global price of oil drops much more, U.S ability to expand and produce energy will be threatened? Give him some time b4 you also explain that bringing down the price of oil only makes it tougher to sell coal.
5986 2018-11-22 15:24:24 I know. This works and even our pediatrician said it works. Tea tree oil is an anti-viral so it kills the virus before it can spread.
5987 2018-11-22 15:24:20 And yes the tweet did imply that.  Trump thanked SA for lower oil prices and the tweet said but, but, but you buy more oil from Canada.  WTF is the correlation between oil prices and who the US buys its oil from.  And you post a 6 month old Washington Post article. Please.
5988 2018-11-22 15:24:13 You economic numbers are false.  The reliance on Saudi oil is false.  
However the Saudi royal family bailed you out of bankruptcy not once but twice.  
Quit saying it’s bc America first. When anyone with half a brain knows it’s Donald’s the Saudis Bitch.
5989 2018-11-22 15:24:04 sana oil
5990 2018-11-22 15:23:57 It’s so hard to eat healthy in a brown household because our food has more oil than Saudi Arabia
5991 2018-11-22 15:23:55 Saudi Arabia and Russia put alot of American oil companies out of business by driving oil cost way down they once that was accomplished they drove it back up. Gas is the highest it's been since 2014
5992 2018-11-22 15:23:50 agh sana oil
5993 2018-11-22 15:23:48 This photo slightly looks like an oil painting in the distance.
5994 2018-11-22 15:23:46 Oil price falling because of supply glut. Trump is just lying. Truth is supply and demand and that's how news should report, facts - lie - facts each time Trump lies.
5995 2018-11-22 15:23:43 I do not like Kichidi either. I hate mustard oil/mustard paste. So, Bengali cuisine is not for me. But, sweets & Mutton are great here.
5996 2018-11-22 15:23:40 IT IS ALL GMO BECAUSE IT WAS ORIGINALLY A TOXIC-OIL PLANT. The plant was originally NOT INTENDED AS A FOOD OIL but was genetically modified to make it so. And I still have trouble digesting it. Get your facts straight!
5997 2018-11-22 15:23:37 士気10で武+8知+4はどうなん
5998 2018-11-22 15:23:33 Trump just STFU about Saudi effect on oil prices.   About Saudi murdering elites.   And money, and America First.  It’s about Trump first.  So, they vehemently deny it.   You wrote that for them right?  STFU
5999 2018-11-22 15:23:32 I think the point is that to hold a rambling call with the military on Thanksgiving to gripe and whine about the courts, lie about oil prices, bash half the country and display sheer ignorance on how the military works.. is disgraceful. 
But not to you evidently.
6000 2018-11-22 15:23:25 But I see your point: if no new line is built, then no oil flows, then no tolls are paid, then it’s irrelevant how high they are set. 

Oil needs to flow for the condition to be met.
6001 2018-11-22 15:23:22 Seriously thinking of trying out CBD oil
6002 2018-11-22 15:23:18 Sometimes when I’m cooking I remember when Kim was making pancakes at her house and asked how much oil she should use and jess said “idk enough to fill the pan?”  winging everything same af bro I love her 
6003 2018-11-22 15:23:18 I like neem oil n daily use it.
6004 2018-11-22 15:23:18 Absolutely. He’s complicit in Khashoggi’s murder! Canada is biggest supplier by far of oil to US, SA distant second. A word from US and MBS would be gone. Its a moral travesty to do what trump has done.
6005 2018-11-22 15:23:15 僕のフォロワーさんは性に対して不干渉or貪欲でやばいやつのみ洗練されて残っているが、たまに普通の子においるさんのツイート面白いです><とか言われるとあぁTwitterってこんな感じで楽しむものなのかなるほど(シコシコ)ってなる(ならない)
6006 2018-11-22 15:23:07 He’s playing a shell game. It’s about condos and loans and secrets, not oil. USA imports more than four times as much oil from Canada as from Sauds, he treats Canada and its leaders with disdain. This isn’t about oil.
6007 2018-11-22 15:23:05 And the fact is we get about 10% of our Oil from the Saudis, about 40% from Canada. The Saudis need us more than we need them. @PressSec @realDonaldTrump
6008 2018-11-22 15:23:05 We were on track to eliminate our dependence on foreign oil and eventually bringing down our use of petrochemicals to manufacturing use but Trump and his minions have set the World back one hundred years.
6009 2018-11-22 15:23:03 Seattle (WA) Times-Business: Caricom to waive taxes on oil as Petrotrin refinery closes
6010 2018-11-22 15:23:01 I would suggest you use a facial oil overnight - our Argan Rescue Oil is a wonderfully hydrating oil which gives you a boost of Vitamin C to help with healthy collagen production. In the morning, we recommend the Probiotic Mutli-Mineral Repair Mask to help fight dry skin.
6011 2018-11-22 15:23:01 Falling Oil prices has given momentum to Bond Yield.
6012 2018-11-22 15:22:59 Is there anyone out there that believes this televangelist? Snake oil salesmen and used car salesmen can’t compete with this liar#. #onpoli
6013 2018-11-22 15:22:58 He might’ve passed out frfr lol put baby oil on the floor so we he come out he go slip and slide lmao
6014 2018-11-22 15:22:55 Fastest way of cooking a turkey: Grab a pot, lots of oil, get the oil to boiling and chuck in the completely frozen turkey. Instant success.
6015 2018-11-22 15:22:53 @realDonaldTrump You have no command of the facts on oil prices. The American People do not support you on Saudi Arabia.We don’t need allies like MBS. He is murderous thug and you and @jaredkushner are accessories to murder.
6016 2018-11-22 15:22:50 Can’t wait to drop my frozen turkey into hot oil over a flame in a small kitchen with towels nearby
6017 2018-11-22 15:22:44 Did anybody tell @realDonaldTrump that #SaudiArabia wanted #OPEC to cut oil production to raise prices?

Isn't there some way to make that into a picture for the #PresidentialDailyBriefing
6018 2018-11-22 15:22:42 Nice...that app is useless in Trinidad & Tobago....too many oil and gas heads!
6019 2018-11-22 15:22:41 It can and should be done. We have technology now that can be put to use in order to drastically cut emissions and gas/oil/coal consumption. Funds gained can go toward that. Putting in sustainable farming that will not harm the environment. So many ideas.
6020 2018-11-22 15:22:41 Mein teri g ka liya butter nahi sarso ka oil use kar ga 
6021 2018-11-22 15:22:39 You inadvertently came upon a campaign slogan yesterday when praising (wrongly) you new best friend Saudi Arabia for the low oil prices. I recommend you use it in 2020:

“Let’s go lower!”
6022 2018-11-22 15:22:39 God Damn.... “ I was blamed for causing traffic jams...Oil is so low”...you know what...Donald...STFU...you are true garbage.  Hell waits for your kind...Mueller 
6023 2018-11-22 15:22:36 Decided my brand of feminism is I can do whatever the hell I want but I shouldn’t *have to* get my oil changed, mow grass, or take out the trash.
6024 2018-11-22 15:22:35 I guess he doesn't know we get most of our oil from Canada, who he constantly disses, and where journalists are safe to travel.
6025 2018-11-22 15:22:33 6-De-Regulation for business growth. 7-Economic & Market super growth all time high. Make-Keep American Greats Again. I predict market will be up later today and up to 27,000 on 11/28/2018 also will be hit 36,265 on 10/2020. Crude Oil future go down to $42.on 5/13/2019.
6026 2018-11-22 15:22:28 hahaha  im sad now i was just told by a very informed person that if he allowed the price of a barrel of oil to rise by $50 the world will sink into depression...somebody has a "IM THE MOST POWERFUL PERSON ON EARTH" complex & its needs to be checked......
6027 2018-11-22 15:22:21 "I dislike it more than you do. They could raise the oil price $50 a barrel if they want to" First, we clearly dislike it more than you do, @realDonaldTrump , as I think more of us are scared to death that you think oil prices are more important than freedom of the press. STFU
6028 2018-11-22 15:22:19 A holiday to celebrate food and family is a good thing. As we do that, let's remember:
- Native peoples in North Dakota had their voting rights stripped away this fall.
- The Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate tribe in South Dakota is dealing with a 200,000 gallon oil spill near their land
6029 2018-11-22 15:22:16 As #trump is currently speaking from Florida, I'm expecting a turkey leg will fly out of his mouth, considering the rest of the vomit he is spewing. And he said he is jaw boning the price of oil lower.  Jaw boning somehow reminds me that he is an ass. @realDonaldTrump #ResignNow
6030 2018-11-22 15:22:10 #SaturatedFats are also found in a few vegetable oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, hydrogenated oils, and chocolate. #HeartHealth
6031 2018-11-22 15:22:05 Thank Jamal Khashoggi. Bc of his death the terrorist regime of the #KSA flooded the mkt with Saudi oil. All u did was support them in his horrific murder & death.
6032 2018-11-22 15:22:04 Serve straightaway with another piece of oil until smooth.
6033 2018-11-22 15:22:03 Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Thursday  that he sees weak oil demand in January and said the kingdom will  respond accordingly to cool the global market’s anxiety.
6034 2018-11-22 15:21:55 @sccstreetsahead on the exit sliproad on parkway at matalan there is DANGEROUS OIL SPILLAGE and my friend has just lost control of her car on it. Please attend urgently. @syptweet
6035 2018-11-22 15:21:44 Or gow Trump contributed to low oil prices.
6036 2018-11-22 15:21:42 Nothing @realDonaldTrump is saying has any credence. Saudi has 8% of our oil share. They didn’t drop our barrels $30 overnight. There are no traffic jams because of him. The MX caravan isn’t MS13. He’s trying for political hysteria.
6037 2018-11-22 15:21:40 รอแลกการ์ดบั้มใหม่เลยค่ะน้องออย ><
6038 2018-11-22 15:21:38 Well I guess that lets Saudi Arabia off the hook! You have no decency tweeting about Saudi oil prices after they killed and dismembered an American resident.  Mueller Hurry Up!
6039 2018-11-22 15:21:37 We get 40% of our oil from Canada.  You fail to mention that.
6040 2018-11-22 15:21:35 Congratulations to the hard working men and women of the oil patch and to farsighted #wildcatters like my late friend Mick McMurry, RIP.
6041 2018-11-22 15:21:35 I hope you are listening to Donald rambling on about how he chooses Saudi Arabia over our own intelligence. But hey, we get jobs and oil from Saudi Arabia.  Who cares if they killed and dismembered one of our own, amirite? Are you disgusted yet?  Will you continue to do nothing?
6042 2018-11-22 15:21:32 みんなハイライトの入れ方違うの良き…あの！！おめめのなかにハートあるの凄く可愛いです
6043 2018-11-22 15:21:32 If a citizen’s life is worth less than oil or arms to our government, then the government long ago stopped being “of the people, for the people.”
6044 2018-11-22 15:21:31 Prepare as much as you can, the day before Christmas Day.  For the best roast potatoes, boil for 10 minutes, then pop in a very hot oven, with the oil of your choice.  These can be prepared early in the day, then heat up later, with the stuffing and pigs in blankets.

6046 2018-11-22 15:21:26 Obama didn't have anything to do with that though. Under most of Obama's time as president, gas prices were hovering at $3.60. They only eventually dropped because major oil refineries in the middle easy dropped their prices down to choke out competition.
6047 2018-11-22 15:21:24 Someone please tell Trump our main source  of oil does not come from Saudi
6048 2018-11-22 15:21:17 Trump says "the Crown Prince hates this crime more than I do.....".   He keeps talking about oil prices. He says "the world is to blame because the world is dangerous place"   MbS should give Trump a few billion in his Christmas stocking this year...and Jared too of course.
6049 2018-11-22 15:21:06 Hard?  I’ll take anything at this point.  Has one reporter said Canada gives us more oil

6052 2018-11-22 15:21:01 Doesn't he ever shut up. Thanking the troops by phone while he sits in luxury.  Then he thanks saudies for low oil prices after he called them. Why we only import 9% of our oil from them while Canada is 40%.
6053 2018-11-22 15:21:01 Reading this as trump, again, excuses Saudi atrocities for oil. Question: since they supply only 10% of our oil and Canada supplies the biggest share, what can Trudeau do, and get away with it? It's something else, his Saudi lust. And this at the border is an atrocity in itself.
6054 2018-11-22 15:21:00 hoje é dia de escutar zimbra e midnight oil até desidratar
6055 2018-11-22 15:20:58 Canada imports more oil into the US than #Saudi
6056 2018-11-22 15:20:57 Someone Please inform Trump that the United States is fast becoming the largest Crude Oil Producer in the World because of Shale NOT because he has magic touch with OPEC who are losing their ars on profits via crude supply glut on Market! Oil Companies Profits drop fast(your buds
6057 2018-11-22 15:20:56 The plan was for #ISIS terrorists to overrun weak Syrian and Iraqi militaries and capture oil reservoirs: Turkey would then intervene and 'rescue' these countries with its massive (albeit incompetent) military as it has already done in #Afrin and Euphrates Shield areas.
6058 2018-11-22 15:20:47 Gas prices are falling because there is too much oil available-Econ 101.  Supply and demand.  And...there is fear that the economy is softening.  Get real, please.
6059 2018-11-22 15:20:47 Real whipped cream or that oil based, fake, stuff?
6060 2018-11-22 15:20:44 @realDonaldTrump The ninth circuit is upholding our CONSTITUTON  and LAWS!

A "conference call" to miitary members?  You are such a coward it's unbelievable!

Saudi Arabia murdered our reporter!  I trust the CIA

YOU have the oil prices low???  You need to up your haldol.
6061 2018-11-22 15:20:38 POTUS continues to brag about oil dropping.  Thinking Texas wishes they would’ve voted for @BetoORourke.
6062 2018-11-22 15:20:36 Since when is a president responsible for crime in the city? What the hell is the police and mayor for? Decorating?You are the same people praising trump for selling America out to Saudi Arabia for a little oil. Jared is comprised and all you fools keeps saying is but Obama.
6063 2018-11-22 15:20:31 Cut the tape.  This is the most embarrassing and gross thing ever seen.  Why do the reporters allow him to spew lies about oil etc.
6064 2018-11-22 15:20:26 Most of the oil we import come from Canada, almost 4 times more than from Saudi Arabia. ...and Justin Trudeau hasn’t murdered many reporters recently. Asshole!!!
6065 2018-11-22 15:20:22 @realDonaldTrump hey WEAK MORON!  Ya, YOU!  Only 12% of our oil comes from Saudis ...
6066 2018-11-22 15:20:14 It’s a faster cooking method than slow roasting. The danger comes from people not understanding that the bird will displace a certain amount of oil in the pot. That’s why they overflow and flame up. I’m sure it seems like magic to some folks though.
6067 2018-11-22 15:20:10 Haven’t what? They don’t meet until December.  Current oil prices are below their production costs.
6068 2018-11-22 15:20:10 Before discovery of Oil, they used to come Bharat and ask for donations to organise Hajj and do other religious activity

6074 2018-11-22 15:20:04 Many predicted a global meltdown spreading from the oil industry across the world when oil sank to $25, but it did not happen, because whereas a few million people in the industry were temporarily affected, 99% of the world benefited from low oil. Same will happen with EVs.
6075 2018-11-22 15:20:00 The problem I have is that I see a lot of action to promote boycott, but not a lot of action to promote the creation of protected areas. If palm oil becomes a thing of the past, I highly doubt that capitalists will be out of reasons to keep the deforestation going.
6076 2018-11-22 15:19:42 @realDonaldTrump Yes we Americans want you to give up these arms dealers and put sanctions on Saudi Arabia the murder of the journalist yes yes yes I do not sell my soul for oil and the gas here in California 3.99 a gallon
6077 2018-11-22 15:19:41 Very possible.  Think we’ll see soon enough in markets.  Action of Gold/oil ratio past mth suggestive of CNY oil pricing not USD, but time will tell.
6078 2018-11-22 15:19:39 Trump the Chicken-Little President who values Guns, Oil, Money, Despots; Golfing; Big Business more than American lives if threatened overseas.
6079 2018-11-22 15:19:38 AMERICA PRODUCES MORE OIL THAN SAUDI ARABIA. We don’t need their oil. And the Saudis DO NOT SET WORLD OIL PRICES.

6081 2018-11-22 15:19:30 Sir............you had Saudi up their production because of the oil embargo and then you gave out oil exemptions for buying out oil........what did you expect, lower prices of course....I guess you cares Khashoggi was killed. #NO_BACK_BONE_PRESIDENT.......too scarred of Saudi....
6082 2018-11-22 15:19:29 Trump keeps saying Saudi Arabia is responsible for low oil prices. As usual, he is lying. The man is totally clueless and makes it worse every time he opens his mouth.
6083 2018-11-22 15:19:23 QUESTION .@realDonaldTrump- Since Canada supplies four times as much oil to America as Saudi Arabia, can Canada MURDER four of us? Just wondering.
6084 2018-11-22 15:19:23 Damned MSNBC why are you covering that lying POS saying gas prices low? I’m paying 3.15 a gallon. Low my ass. He claims he called saudi arabia a month ago to stop rising oil prices going to $100 a barrel. Bullshit. Trump is a total lying A-hole.
6085 2018-11-22 15:19:17 pour rhonda and zipper joey--barrels of oil costs down from (brent( 81 to 55: duh--means oil at the pump goes down...in houston from $2.55 to $2.17 ---ah, never mind--ocasio carries the day..."supply and demand" is a dance tune
6086 2018-11-22 15:19:15 Trump is claiming oil prices are so low because of him and his “jawboning” and these low prices are causing traffic jams.  He sounds insane.
6087 2018-11-22 15:19:13 So it’s ok the East to have pipelines & Refineries & buy unethical oil from a regime that kills innocent people, while giving subsidies to auto makers for SUV’s while giving major polluters tax exemptions & allowing illegal migrants free entry & nationalization of news? CND lost
6088 2018-11-22 15:19:13 May the water be seperated from oil, may be paid out if heinous crimes have been committed on humanity's soil.
6089 2018-11-22 15:19:10 Potus ... all the billions of $ that you are so enraptured with, especially from the sale of death machinery to Saudi Arabia in return for oil , could have gone to save the children but no, your ivory tower needs to be gilded ... like Flotus, you, “really don’t care”
6090 2018-11-22 15:19:09 Coconut oil is very bad for the heart and arteries. You should remove it
6091 2018-11-22 15:19:07 Get that sorry excuse for a President off the air. He’s criticized our court and lies about everything. He is pissed that he can’t be a Dictator! Taking credit for oil prices being low when Saudi only gives 10 to 11% of our oilThe Intell. DID conclude that they committed murder!
6092 2018-11-22 15:19:07 @realDonaldTrump should thank the American Oil Producers for lowering oil prices.

弓集めて各個撃破したいねん
6094 2018-11-22 15:18:58 You are a man of many talents. You were generous on the hair though. As long as the oil and weapon sales keep flowing this and future US administrations, like their predecessors, will continue to overlook the atrocities committed by the House of Saud. #IraqWar #Yemen

6099 2018-11-22 15:18:50 and look what happened to Nik Tesla and Stan Meyer...... killed for threatening Big oil
6100 2018-11-22 15:18:48 America lost its moral values 6754 lies ago.. jst like the lies now Saudi Arabia only counts for 11% of oil imports America produces more than they do.. at wht point do you confront this president wht cabinet post are you looking for WAFFLE BOY
6101 2018-11-22 15:18:44 JAWBONING the Saudi’s they put out hits , @realDonaldTrump JAWBONES them to keep oil prices down Mob like much #jawboning
6102 2018-11-22 15:18:41 11% of US imported oil comes from Saudi. 40% from Canada. Does it mean Canada may kill 3-4 American based journalists without repercussion?
6103 2018-11-22 15:18:39 Literally NO ONE has said that .@RealDonaldTrump causes traffic jams because of low oil prices.  They HAVE said there are traffic jams because of his excessive golfing trips and vacations. #thanksgivingtravel @WhiteHouse #MarALago
6104 2018-11-22 15:18:34 Arabia is not btr w.human rights, pompeo.  Ask khashoggi, the 2 murdered Saudi sisters. Salman do all 3??? Cheap oil to butter u up.  U 3 are full of shittt

6106 2018-11-22 15:18:25 Trump is decrying the United States in torality lying on our first responders, our courts.  Sudia arabia is subsiduzing. The president by pumping out oil.  A real sceamer in chief
6107 2018-11-22 15:18:25 try melatonin or a lavender essential oil on your pillow. 2 drops of lavender or buy a spray bottle from the dollar store and put 4-5 drops in it and fill it w/ water. shake it and spray it on both sides of your pillow and blanket. it triggers sleeping
6108 2018-11-22 15:18:24 Blood for oil. It’s ok with cheetoh face.
6109 2018-11-22 15:18:24 Did Trump just admit he worked with the Saudi’s to Blow off Khashoggi’s murder for lowering oil prices?
6110 2018-11-22 15:18:23 @realdonaldtrump - just because Saudi Arabia which only provides 11% of oil compared to 40% from Canada - you make it ok to murder a journalist living and working in USA. Just because somebody denies something-doesn't make it not true. #TrumpFakePresident
6111 2018-11-22 15:18:23 Baby johnsons is really gentle, andd from the body shop I use the tea tree oil scrub (doesnt smell so great but it really went well with my skin). You just gotta try a few things and see what suits your skin best. Took me a few attempts to get mine right so don't get frustrated
6112 2018-11-22 15:18:22 Thou shall not murder, unless you have oil.  

Thou shall not commit adultery, unless you are rich, oppose abortion, and are willing to appoint conservative Supreme Court Justices.

Thou shall not lie, unless you promise to build walls.

6114 2018-11-22 15:18:12 Saudi Arabia can murder human beings and get away with it as long as we get oil and contacts that justify the crime!!!!
6115 2018-11-22 15:18:10 Tiddy meat need a light oil drizzle to bring out that appetizing look and mouth feel
6116 2018-11-22 15:18:08 It’s a shame the 9th circuit is real hurting our military, who are the people making these decisions, Saudi Arabia best ally, I’m keeping oil prices low, causing traffic jams can you believe that, because of what I did and the Saudi Arabia is helping us, nobody concluded anything
6117 2018-11-22 15:18:05 And funny how it’s directly correlated  to the 20% drop in the oil price...
6118 2018-11-22 15:18:01 Have a look, Adrian’s tweeted it, somebody called John took it
6119 2018-11-22 15:18:00 You can’t think that Americans are stupid enough to think the relationship with the Saudis has anything to do with oil.
6120 2018-11-22 15:17:59 Min Ncube proposes to ring-fence importation of 10 000 tons of Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil fertilizer under suspension of duty for a period of twelve months beginning 1 January 2019, in order to reduce the cost of inputs into production.
6121 2018-11-22 15:17:59 Don’t get me wrong I agree with their point, but I think the ban of palm oil (especially from an affordable supermarket) deserves praise before criticism!

6125 2018-11-22 15:17:50 My Pop's been talking to me and my bros about deep frying a turkey for a few days. Never told my Mom. She got up and prepped it, stuffed it for the oven. We got a fryer and mad oil on the bench now. Strong start, #Thanksgiving
6126 2018-11-22 15:17:50 Traffic jams because of low oil prices??? Such bullshit. $3.35/gal is not going to stop traffic
6127 2018-11-22 15:17:47 @POTUS you can't even keep your lies & ego to yourself on THANKSGIVING?!? GAS PRICES ARE NOT LOW - ESPECIALLY considering oil prices! Traffic jams?!? Get. Over. Yourself. Happy Thanksgiving, America. The #LiarInChief hates you
6128 2018-11-22 15:17:42 Why does the media shut down trumps assertion that oil prices are lower due to Saudi Arabia. A Joke
6129 2018-11-22 15:17:41 You forgot the oil and gas prices were also low during President Obama Presidency
6130 2018-11-22 15:17:40 Hahahahahaha he just said there was an article about how HE CAUSED traffic jams because HE made gas prices low.  Of course we only get 11 percent of our oil from Saudi Arabia.  We import the most from Canada.
6131 2018-11-22 15:17:37 Is still carrying on about how he dropped the oil prices and what a great friend Saudi Arabia is in about the hundreds of billions of dollars they are going to invest and they probably won't kill very many more people
6132 2018-11-22 15:17:35 Trump the #LiarInChief says oil prices have never been lower. 

Check the oil price in 2016 when it was just over $29 per barrel under Pres Obama.
6133 2018-11-22 15:17:35 trump now claims he has control of the global crude oil market.......the ramblings of a fool
6134 2018-11-22 15:17:33 The masterpiece does the child be able to cod liver oil and millionaires! I told her happiness----and more for me under the
6135 2018-11-22 15:17:32 The irony is that the Saudis are NOT driving the gas prices down. It’s our own production of oil that is. We are the largest oil producer in the world. Trump is looking to his personal bottom line here, and he is a traitor who must be locked up.

She replied 'They don't count.'
Huh?
6140 2018-11-22 15:17:18 Donald, you did know that canada is your biggest oil supplier at 40% while Saudi Arabia is only 11%....why do you keep pushing your allies away.

6142 2018-11-22 15:17:15 President Obama had lower oil prices!
6143 2018-11-22 15:17:14 Mueller have the 9th circuit on his side.  Bone spur Trump. Now is an oil dictator.
6144 2018-11-22 15:17:13 These two are being fried. Friday night at the camp I’m going to boil two more in crawfish seasoning with all the vegetables and then put them in the oil less cooker to get the color right.
6145 2018-11-22 15:17:05 Since you don't know what's going on we only get 7% of our oil from Arabia. 40% from Canada you dummy. You have nothing to do with lower gas prices and it's $3.79 a gallon in California and it's your fault right
6146 2018-11-22 15:17:03 Someone please get your president from in front of the cameras. He is making a complete fool of himself!!! This is like watching a very bad episode of Saturday night live. He thinks that he's causing traffic jams by low oil prices. Once again praising killers...the Saudis!!
6147 2018-11-22 15:16:59 Omg! I’m in trouble! I just stuffed a oil spotted owl !
6148 2018-11-22 15:16:56 OIL FOR BLOOD
6149 2018-11-22 15:16:52 @realDonaldTrump is such a f*cking liar.  He has nothing to do with gas prices, Canada provides the US more oil, and Saudi Arabia isn't spending close to what he claims
6150 2018-11-22 15:16:50 God will put oil of Gladness into your life. Amen.
6151 2018-11-22 15:16:48 Is the price of our nation’s reputation and morality worth oil and money? Is Saudi Arabia the only country that produces oil? What is the price of human life?
6152 2018-11-22 15:16:47 Model 3 is the coolest ... I never sat in a Chevy of any kind this great ... and no need for gas or oil !!!!
6153 2018-11-22 15:16:46 THIS is a message you put out on Thanksgiving? One man’s murder is worth it because of “big jobs & oil?” Show me the jobs! We produce more oil than we import from SA! More #FakeNews from you. #Shameful behavior on national holiday for giving “thanks.”
6154 2018-11-22 15:16:45 To get more from Fulanis oil and gas resources? Thunderstrike is searching for you!
6155 2018-11-22 15:16:41 no.
6156 2018-11-22 15:16:35 He ordered it. He's ultimately responsible, and what are the Saudis going to do if that red line is crossed?

Not buy our arms? Their military wont go for it. They wont screw with oil prices either, because it'd cause a price shock. They don't have leverage they think they do.

6160 2018-11-22 15:16:23 Trump is now bragging about getting oil prices down and lying about people blaming him for traffic jams
6161 2018-11-22 15:16:21 bohole sold out US interests to his EU bosses & mullahcracy regime. EU wanted no US threats against their CASH COW business investment in mullahcracy, thus right before elections EU & mullahcracy monkeyed around w our elections by raising oil production to save BO's a**

6162 2018-11-22 15:16:20 Most of our oil is from Canada though right? Thanks Canada!
6163 2018-11-22 15:16:16 I agree 100%. In order to build our infrastructure; economy; put people back to work; and to provide for the common welfare of our nation: "we should never prop up dictators on the phoney promise of, "Billions of Dollars of purchases made in U.S., big Jobs & Oil!"

6165 2018-11-22 15:16:13 So you’re saying Canada should just stop producing oil and gas? Full stop?  Is pollution generated in the US worse than the same pollution generated in, say Ireland? Or Australia, which produces the same amount of CO2 emissions per capita as the US?  What’s your criticism?
6166 2018-11-22 15:16:11 Or any other morning. And this rambling about oil prices is totally a lie.

6174 2018-11-22 15:15:40 You had nothing to do with oil prices unless you bribed the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Which is totally possible. President Longnoser, the ultimate liar.

6188 2018-11-22 15:14:34 That's not what I meant. It's the other way around. It doesn't take much work to dig up lots of stories about oil companies supporting solar/wind. Even if it's not money, popular culture support drives adoption, and that adoption (without other alternatives) leads to lock-in.
6189 2018-11-22 15:14:33 For those of you deep frying a turkey today, best way to do it IMO, make sure your bird is completely thawed out & dried off before going in the oil. 3 1/2 mns per pound, +5 minutes, at 350°. Be safe & enjoy. #CookingTips #Thanksgiving

6210 2018-11-22 15:12:59 Canada supplies about 40% of your oil, Saudi about 10%. Just an FYI.
6211 2018-11-22 15:12:58 Η Μotor Oil έκλεισε στα 19,86 ευρώ με απώλειες 1,68% όγκο 147 χιλ. τεμάχια και αποτίμηση 2,2 δισ. ευρώ
6212 2018-11-22 15:12:49 Correct, humans do not have the power to control the weather. They do, however, have the power through man made gases to accelerate natural climate change. Ever seen the affects of an oil spill in the ocean or toxins in a river? The atmosphere is a river, too. You have an impact.
6213 2018-11-22 15:12:49 @AJNewsGrid $15B a year for Saudi in military spending is very close to the 2% of GDP that Trump has asked NATO to do.  It takes on the order of 7-8 years to accrue $110B worth of sales.  Unless oil prices spike upwards, then things might accelerate

6215 2018-11-22 15:12:39 She is not right-wing, she is an evil Neocon, no different from Bush or Obama. She and Sarcozy killed Gaddafi and destroyed Libya so they could get their oil, as well as his gold. These people must be stopped by European citizens electing nationalists.
6216 2018-11-22 15:12:38 The US produces more oil than Saudi Arabia & the US gets most of its oil from Canada! Saudi Arabia is low on our supply list, so WHY is their oil so important? More misleading stories from YOU, Prince Rabadash! AND the US sells most of the Alaskan oil to China!

6220 2018-11-22 15:12:18 Actually, the refineries in Quebec do not import Saudi oil. Other countries supply them. Irving in St. John is the only Saudi importer in Canada.
6221 2018-11-22 15:12:17 We only get 10% of our oil from Saudi Arabia!
6222 2018-11-22 15:12:15 Yes. We get it. You agree 100% with Money, Corporations and Oil.

6224 2018-11-22 15:12:03 なんかその頃から色々考えて動くすみりんぽさがあったんやな中学生すみりん見てみたかったわぁ
6225 2018-11-22 15:12:00 ありがとうございます！これから色々やってみたいですね〜！
6226 2018-11-22 15:11:57 Fun fact, if you don't like the fish oil, a big meta-analysis just came out in August that found no appreciable impact of taking them, but your mileage may vary
6227 2018-11-22 15:11:56 @spiceytherobot your what are things you used for draw in color painting or water painting or oil painting
6228 2018-11-22 15:11:54 It’s basically 2:1:1 coffee/salt/pepper with some garlic and punted seasoning thrown in.

Coat it with olive oil and a little apple cider mixed together and then hit it with the rub

Everyone is always skeptical and then loves it
6229 2018-11-22 15:11:53 How many more people do you need to murder to get it down to $50? And BTW, oil prices are not lower due to SA but don’t let me get in the way of you lying to your base to amp them up. We all know they won’t research it. Love my new country that cozies up to murderous dictators!
6230 2018-11-22 15:11:41 life in guadalajara was never mysterious, but it was good enough for john, a oil rig worker. but their world is turned upside down when they meet a actor. it's a story they'll never forget. featuring john boyega and riz ahmed.

6232 2018-11-22 15:11:32 My house is real cold. Have the oil company checking the furnace again.
6233 2018-11-22 15:11:30 Heheheh they’re not warts, but molluscum contagiosum. If you pop them when they have a head and put tea tree oil on, they don’t spread and they will heal on a few days. The only thing that worked so far with my kids. Sorry, tmi.
6234 2018-11-22 15:11:30 2016 was when it got cheap in AZ I believe it was 2014 when Obama passed the law allowing us to export more oil but it didn’t affect us til early 2016 if I remember correctly. Gas would not be this cheap if he didn’t pass that. But 2010-2015 was 3.50-4 a gallon here in AZ.
6235 2018-11-22 15:11:29 Confessions of a kumba Slay Queen: “I used to admire guys with gapped front teeth on till my titi got stuck in-between and we had to use olive oil to remove it
6236 2018-11-22 15:11:28 It really sucks to know that oil is worth more than blood....#damnshame
6237 2018-11-22 15:11:28 Lied to again by Westminster!! When will people wake up and understand we need to be independent. Keep our fishing, oil, all other revenue we create. Enough of London rule and bring it home. Time is now!!!
6238 2018-11-22 15:11:26 This country does not need Saudi Oil, the price at the pump was much lower prior to this President’s Inauguration.  He’s ceding this country to benefit his own personal finances.
6239 2018-11-22 15:11:26 since 40% of your oil imports come from Canada, and only about 11% come from Saudi....
you tell me. ;)

6243 2018-11-22 15:10:59 Saudi Arabia and Russia are both petro-dependent regimes to which Trump is beholden. Republican candidates depend on oil industry money. Wealthy people can afford their own climate migration, so Trump’s true constituants all benefit from this lie in support of inaction.

6245 2018-11-22 15:10:44 @narendramodi A big thank you & your team for opening the Kartarpur corridor, good decision from the governor on the Kashmir front. A big thank you to you and your team for deftly handling the Iran oil crisis and The sanctions that were hovering over us in the form of S-400. Well
6246 2018-11-22 15:10:43 Maybe they do maybe they don’t. But it’s a tough world. And he just cut a deal for cheap oil so there are traffic jams and more carbon emissions because it’s cold this winter. And the Saudi buys billions of weapons to hurt Yemen, which is a far worse enemy. And other things.
6247 2018-11-22 15:10:28 I don't know enough about this spill to comment on any of the timelines. Just that we all lose big on less oil. It's the game we are in whether we like it or not.
6248 2018-11-22 15:10:27 I see all snake oil salesmen stick together
6249 2018-11-22 15:10:23 You're so full of shit, it's beyond belief! Saudi's lowering gas prices aren't because YOU did anything, it's lower because there's too much oil reserved, and they needed to move it. Of course ORANGEMAN takes all the credit for lower gas prices. His phone call is ME ME ME A HOLE!
6250 2018-11-22 15:10:19 The entire world knew what America was: a war machine that perpetuates violence to attain oil, military contracts, and power. Everyone knew except for the majority of Americans.
6251 2018-11-22 15:10:11 Sure sex is great and all but have you ever roasted garlic in the oven with olive oil, salt, and pepper at 180°C for 20 - 25 minutes?
6252 2018-11-22 15:10:08 I still smell of  and  and a wonderful beard oil.
6253 2018-11-22 15:10:07 U can use coconut oil as well
6254 2018-11-22 15:10:03 全ての油という油に感謝しているよ。
6255 2018-11-22 15:10:01 We produce our own oil (we have plenty) and 40% comes from Canada, only 9% from Saudi Arabia.  Mr. Trump they fill your personal pockets with money so you are OK with them committing a horrible crime and allowing them to get away with it.  OK if someone from your family?
6256 2018-11-22 15:09:51 Yes. It’s not an arms deal, it’s not oil, It’s personal.
6257 2018-11-22 15:09:43 @rickwtyler 
“Nearly everything @realDonaldTrump has said about our relationship with Saudi Arabia, military contracts, jobs, oil prices, economic impact     and “maybe he did, maybe he didn’t” is a lie! That does not protect American interests, values or security.”
6258 2018-11-22 15:09:41 So a little premeditated murder of journalists and protesters, political opponents, kidnapping of kids, is not a problem, as long as we can monetize it. “Buy our oil and arms, receive a free get-out-of-jail card, good for murder, embezzling, emoluments, treason , tax fraud etc.”!
6259 2018-11-22 15:09:40 I like the sound of that Heid 
6260 2018-11-22 15:09:36 Gas prices are up. They were driven up by your actions & tariffs months ago. Saudi Arabia produces only 13% of world’s oil & is slashing production to drive prices up. Everything you say is a lie! #PutinsPuppet #MalignantNarcissist
6261 2018-11-22 15:09:33 Even if it’s a 4.4 % return .. it’s not a good return.  The total cost, territorial disputes and vision of the project vs. Its ong term benefit and the actual beneficiaries (oil&gas companies and infrastructure companies during the construction phase) = shortsighted investment
6262 2018-11-22 15:09:24 ANOTHER LIE, we get (40%of our oil and only (8%) from your boy friend and killer the Saudis.
6263 2018-11-22 15:09:21 Aww, Southend Esplanade. The joy of Essex. The smell of the Thames. The clap of the oil refinery. The sight  (the horror) of half (or less) naked Cockneys. Fish and chip packets round your feet. The chink of boat masts and the rattle of railway lines. Happy days...

6265 2018-11-22 15:09:17 This morning I woke up at the butt crack of dawn and stood in line for a pre Black Friday sale for motor oil. Even Dad can’t resist a Black Friday sale. Might be the strangest job request I’ve gotten yet! #IWasntTheOnlyOneInLine #BlackFriday #MyJobIsTheBest
6266 2018-11-22 15:09:12 All i'm seeing is Saudi Arabia giving money to traitors to keep power. While other oil nations are just mean to the "chosen people." Again Happy Thanksgiving!
6267 2018-11-22 15:09:02 Actually deferred oil is essentially lost because you are appending it to the tail end 15-20 years from now. Discount it at the rate of return used in the industry and it is very much lost. Also all the costs incurred now are shields against royalties. They only pay on profit.
6268 2018-11-22 15:08:47 Please tell how much oil Saudi Arabia exports. Doesn’t Canada export more. Saudi Arabia has paid 15 billion. Saudi Arabia killed Khashoggi. Majority of terrorists 9/11 came from
Saudi. Didn’t the Saudi’s behead a girl because she was raped. Think you should get better friends.
6269 2018-11-22 15:08:44 Economics Donnie. Saudi Arabia has no say so on where the price of oil goes. Did you not study the world markets that trade commodities sets the price of oil, copper, soybeans, etc?  Thank god the US will only have to listen to this dribble 4 two more yrs.
6270 2018-11-22 15:08:36 Canadians are US enemies because we're not corrupt enough and do not fill the House of Trump coffers. Oddly more oil comes from Canada than Saudi Arabia the nation he's so thankful for. We don't butcher journalists either so the Houses of Saud and Trump have both sanctioned us.
6271 2018-11-22 15:08:28 Pep - PL made me better

Think he means oil money did.
6272 2018-11-22 15:08:24 We already don't fund any of the ideas of our current politicians. That's why we have a deficit kid.  We pay for things with dollars that don't even exist. And we do it for the interests of oil companies and weapons manufacturers instead of for everyone.
6273 2018-11-22 15:08:22 His decision was in the best interest of our country as harsh as it might be. His comments could have been a lot better; e.g. his tweet thanking Saudis Arabia for oil prices? C’mon was that really necessary? 

Happy Turducken Day

6291 2018-11-22 15:07:14 she stops short before she mentions oil
6292 2018-11-22 15:07:11 Trump is just a moron. He is not that smart he just sees oil signs & $$$
6293 2018-11-22 15:07:10 May be oil companies are compensating ₹1/loss they have been forced to bear by govt..
6294 2018-11-22 15:07:10 Trump thinks of Canadian oil as ‘domestic supply’ and he’s not the only American who thinks of it that way.

6297 2018-11-22 15:06:52 True but the oil isn't going anywhere. Let them do their safety checks before they start production again
6298 2018-11-22 15:06:47 I hear there is a huge cut in oil prices from OPEC, when is this reaching Namibia?!
6299 2018-11-22 15:06:38 Hmm. The oil industry wants a NEP.
6300 2018-11-22 15:06:27 As most other oilseed crops cannot thrive in tropical settings, the most likely replacement in these regions to supply global demand for oils (should the $70billion palm oil industry go out of business) is soya.
6301 2018-11-22 15:06:23 Please can you be specific. I’m trying to learn here. I’m not talking about crude oil prices but the parallel market

6303 2018-11-22 15:06:13 Keep banging this drum.  The "Oil rush" must be stopped.
6304 2018-11-22 15:06:13 Renewables, if properly massaged at a moneyed influence level, lead to a lot of dirty fuel lock-in at the moment. Need to offset them in a lot of areas with fast ramping combustion based energy. Didn't you ever question why oil companies seem so happy to prop up solar/wind?
6305 2018-11-22 15:06:02 What do you suggest to do with the still unknown perpetrator that smashed the 60x oil into the stage manually so it shattered...?

6309 2018-11-22 15:05:52 We get 11% of our oil from them you moron! Is the reason you like them so much is because they killed a journalist? How is it that the ones that financed 9/11 are suddenly the good guys but the guy who killed Bin Laden is not?
6310 2018-11-22 15:05:46 cheeto: Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82, he said. thank you to SA, but let’s go lower!
you dipshit, the US imports 40% of oil from CANADA, YES CANADA. we ONLY get 9% (NINE) oil imports from your buddies SA
6311 2018-11-22 15:05:32 @sesamo_oil 11-22のポスト数：58 (うちRT：52)
6312 2018-11-22 15:05:23 And you'd suggest that virtually ending oil in America is an option for us. Tell you what, live oil-free for a year and report back.
I get it. It's ugly. But that's where we are due to left wing stopping oil production in America. That's called " the whole story".
6313 2018-11-22 15:05:23 わかってるー。
6314 2018-11-22 15:05:21 確かにそうですね…
とりあえず明日両親に言ってみます、ありがとうございます
6315 2018-11-22 15:05:16 The people are driving the same as they always have. We get 9% of our imported oil from the human rights violators in the desert, and 40% from Canada. If you want to do something with a lasting impact on oil, you should make nice with @JustinTrudeau no kiss up to dictators.
6316 2018-11-22 15:05:12 He's likely not aware that denial is directly proportional to the size of the oil lobby in the country. That's why the US is the leader in denial.

That 90% of all papers about denial are directly linked to conservative "think thanks."
And that they usually can't pass peer review
6317 2018-11-22 15:05:09 야..야옹...
6318 2018-11-22 15:05:08 *creeeeeeeeeeak* I need me some oil
6319 2018-11-22 15:05:07 Happy Thanksgiving. Be safe
6320 2018-11-22 15:05:02 Just  think how low oil be if trump allowed more America  journalist are murdered
6321 2018-11-22 15:04:58 Fecking shitty Tesco roasting bags! Had one full of chicken thighs and legs, closed with bag tie, massaging olive oil in before placing in oven. 
Split open, showering me in raw, olive oiled chicken pieces. Barf. Grossed out. 

It’s for the BF and the dug, I don’t eat meat!
6322 2018-11-22 15:04:55 Always funny to me-water is the 1st ingredient-highest volume ingredient! I never add water to my own homemade dressing. 
Looks good other than the soybean oil. I made blue cheese dressing recently but kind of a pain bc I had to buy buttermilk. Learned later milk+vinegar works
6323 2018-11-22 15:04:44 There seems to be a lot of snivelling "oil-men" in a fit over oil going cyclically priced as it always does. Markets are never ro blame. #cdnpoli
6324 2018-11-22 15:04:43 飯は食ったのだがね
6325 2018-11-22 15:04:41 He’s selling the “soul” of America for money (oil) !
6326 2018-11-22 15:04:37 Trump’s business debts with multiple bankruptcies & business failures are underwritten by Russians with laundered ‘blood’ money & by folks in the Middle East [aka: Saudi Arabia, etc] with ‘oil’ money! Trump knows US Intel has the evidence to reveal his FRAUDULENT existence!
6327 2018-11-22 15:04:31 はらがへらん
6328 2018-11-22 15:04:31 Big Oil has spent decades saying one thing and doing another. They've known since the 1970s that their activities were going to end in tears. Their response was to set up the anti-science brigade.
6329 2018-11-22 15:04:24 I assure you the Saudi’s, Kuwait, UAE don’t care one iota. They are more than happy to fill the void. Protest them. Replacing our oil with theirs is worse for the environment , worse for human rights. They abuse their migrant workers who live in continual fear. Open your eyes.
6330 2018-11-22 15:04:23 With @realDonaldTrump everything is always “ better than ever” - “like no other” - sounds like an old time snake oil salesman

6333 2018-11-22 15:04:07 Did u know we get 40 % of our oil from Canada and only 11% from SAU? wake up.
6334 2018-11-22 15:04:05 .@GermanyDiplo There should now be an EU, Russia, China, Japan, OPEC Agreement USA pumping Oil is threatening both the World's Economy & the International Peace & Security, my good friends...

6337 2018-11-22 15:03:41 You traded Koshoggi's life for weapons, oil & $$$$. How much lower can YOU go?
6338 2018-11-22 15:03:39 And that is why we must insist on DEFORESTATION-FREE palm oil. Business-as-usual cannot go on.

6340 2018-11-22 15:03:28 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
6341 2018-11-22 15:03:28 The funny thing is how Trish rails against Socialists Countries and America buys oil from Venezuela.
6342 2018-11-22 15:03:28 The United States gets 11% of our crude oil from Saudi Arabia. By contrast, we (the United States) get 40% of our oil from Canada. TRE45ON is, by far, the biggest liar and a total moron.
6343 2018-11-22 15:03:24 We need the oil, no need to mess that up
6344 2018-11-22 15:03:16 Wait, what? The president does NOT affect gas or oil prices. If the president is in the pocket of the Saudis (e.g. covering and making excuses for murdering journalists) he does have to pretend he's influential. So he uses sarcasm to impugn the media. This is head-spinning.
6345 2018-11-22 15:03:14 Not low enough. With all the oil production in America theres no need to import.Gas in America should be a Dollar a gallon. That would permit low income to drive to work.
6346 2018-11-22 15:03:08 Woke up this morning cold and in pain, sitting in my car alone because I no longer want to be here. But I have no money, no license, no plans and my car needs tires, wipers, gas and an oil change at the least. Had the @ga_dps capitol police not pulled me over and arrested me...
6347 2018-11-22 15:03:05 Don't you mean "my data" is the new oil? I don't want you knowing that much about me!

6349 2018-11-22 15:03:03 Hi there! Even though they are partially frozen, you can begin the cooking process. Set your oven to 350 degrees, brush with vegetable oil and cover the pan. They should take 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 hours or longer due to being frozen. Cook until they are fork tender.

6352 2018-11-22 15:02:48 Golly, thanks for confirming that you’re bought and paid for by the Saudis. #weakpresident 

P.S. Fun fact: We only get 11% of our oil from the Saudis.
6353 2018-11-22 15:02:37 Our oil is going to hit the market with a "bang" from the Midland, Texas area as soon as the pipelines are finished.  Saudis are losing their grip on the oil market.  They know it.
6354 2018-11-22 15:02:33 He's away with the fairies this former snake oil salesman, no wonder the churches are empty and the Mosques full.....
6355 2018-11-22 15:02:22 Gee, only 11% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia, while 40% comes from Canada.  And you have insulted Justin Trudeau repeatedly.
6356 2018-11-22 15:02:21 hmmm 10k, lets see

6357 2018-11-22 15:02:20  Propaganda Alert 

Saying that Donald Trump has anything to do with oil prices dropping is like saying only Donald Trump can make Global Warming stop. It’s simply untrue.

“We didn’t have much time for clue searching. We had no idea if even more guards would come”
6365 2018-11-22 15:02:05 Summer blends are transitioning to Fall blends, which are cheaper. Saudi Arabia is cutting oil production to raise oil prices which will counteract any decreases. Yet, you support their monarchy against your own #MAGA mantra. An out of touch Stooge. #Resist #retweet4good

6367 2018-11-22 15:01:53 I think that's why it's frustrating for vegans though - because the impact of normal animal agriculture is so much more devastating to the planet than palm oil production.
6368 2018-11-22 15:01:51 We have our own oil refineries in this great country we call the United States we should not have to rely on Saudi Arabia's oil so idiots can cover up and condone murderers !
6369 2018-11-22 15:01:49 @realDonaldTrump Tramp can not ignore our speeches and people. In the coming months, Iranian oil exports will definitely be cut off, even if the price of oil reaches 100 dollars. The full boycott of Iranian oil is inevitable

We have to give credit sometimes & challenge in the right areas. For now, apart from reducing vegan stock, the no palm oil is great!
6374 2018-11-22 15:01:32 I had to look that word up! I suppose the article is looking at things from an overall perspective rather than orang utan deaths. I guess we want to ideally save both the planet and orang utans. Sustained palm oil production is the aim?

6406 2018-11-22 14:59:30 Japanese press is discussing buying other than Saudi oil in response to Crown Prince’s impunity after ordering #Khashoggi to be silenced. Trump lives on another planet where he used to procure model wives for Saudi arms dealers, buy their yachts, sell them condos. It’s treason.
6407 2018-11-22 14:59:27 You wont get an answer; he should be tried for his involvement. But we must not jeopardise arms sales, oil, education and training of their elite and armed forces. tax free investments the list goes on. Meanwhile Matthew Hedges waits as many others do. The elite are above the law

Just not nice. How can you make such a statement when some pone was murderd? We the People want AMERICA NICE AGAIN.
6410 2018-11-22 14:59:08 Hey Ali. It’s great to see you and your barrel on MSNBC. I am thankful for your insights on the oil market. But as Canada supplies US with 40% of its oil can you give some attention please to the price that the US pays for Canadian oil? It’s much less than the world price.
6411 2018-11-22 14:59:00 ohh okok makasih yaaa, kamu make cleansing oil semacam itu g?
6412 2018-11-22 14:58:56 @realDonaldTrump @VP @FLOTUS PLUS..we get (4x) more oil from Canada than we do Saudi Arabia!
6413 2018-11-22 14:58:54 There’s absolutely no way that Trump would know this. He prob thinks we get 80% of our imported oil from Saudi
6414 2018-11-22 14:58:50 And use an astringent toner like witch hazel to dry out the oil a bit and a good lightweight moisturizer
6415 2018-11-22 14:58:48 "Blood for Oil" rhymes so well with "Blood & Soil" - the dots start to come together
6416 2018-11-22 14:58:47 Plus we only get about 10% of our oil from the Saudi's - Drumpf knows nothing except how to spin the truth into total made up fabrication

6449 2018-11-22 14:55:34 Yeah, masks are great for pulling out oil and excess sebum, if your skin has that profile. Scrubs are more for exfoliating away dead skin, which helps prevent the sebum build up in the first place.

Everyone's skin and body chemistry differs, so experiment carefully.
6450 2018-11-22 14:55:30 You'll want to light the oil on first too so you get that nice flambe caramelization on the skin.

6464 2018-11-22 14:54:38 The oil in your engine captures dirt, keeps everything lubricated, and stops the engine from seizing up.

This isn't about money. This is merely a smug celebration of getting away with murder.
6475 2018-11-22 14:53:48 Satan wants me to die alone, I was cooking and hot cooking oil spilled on to my face. Goodbye face 
6476 2018-11-22 14:53:42 Saudi Arabia controls pretty much oil prices as we currently produce approx 8 million barrels a day and CAPABLE of producing up to 13 million barrels a day. That means in supply and demand Theory, if we produce more, prices go down unlike other countries which cannot.
6477 2018-11-22 14:53:39 And then import oil from other countries because we can’t even get it from our source to the eastern refineries
6478 2018-11-22 14:53:28 The topic of conversation should be about renewable energy and our need to separate our dependency of fossil fuels. Our President Trump has essentially giving a pardon for the murder and dismemberment of a journalist to the Saudis in the name of lower oil prices.
6479 2018-11-22 14:53:26 As if people can't go to a grocery store and buy enough eggs, flour, oil, and baking powder to double their body weight in carbohydrate cakes.

I run 35 miles/week. I need 500-600 calories more a day just to maintain my weight.
6480 2018-11-22 14:53:24 Noooo, no no... That's not it. The big story isn't about traffic jams, it's about how you lowered oil prices by covering for a murderer.

Glad we cleared that up. Happy Thanksgiving.
6481 2018-11-22 14:53:22 Tea tree oil abis.. Jerawatan banyak .. Pusink
6482 2018-11-22 14:53:20 Yes and Mr Trump just thanking S. A. Government for interesting oil prices - these children are being starved and that makes about as much sense as celebrating the forest fires....lives matter!!
6483 2018-11-22 14:53:20 Oil prices are dropping due to over production, the increase is US shale production and we only buy 11% of our oil from SA, 40% from Canada. This is about your personal wealth, not about America First!
6484 2018-11-22 14:53:20 pressed fried green plantain, fresh out the oil, just before dashing salt & lime on top. this simple dish takes me right back to my childhood yard in Pétionville. burning my fingers as I sneak one to eat it in the garden where no one can see me.
6485 2018-11-22 14:53:01 Fuel, clothing, food, oil, milk, biodegradable plastics, paper, and medical uses.
6486 2018-11-22 14:52:56 Oil glut equals low gasoline prices Credit not yours
6487 2018-11-22 14:52:55 The U.S. could be energy independent in less than 5 years between the bakken oil fields and Canadian tar sands. Cut off middle eastern oil and get rid of foreign entanglements. They always have and always will be fighting each other.
6488 2018-11-22 14:52:52 I don't think so. What is the reason for America not to buy Saudi oil? Especially they are strong allies.....
6489 2018-11-22 14:52:51 Love the sarcasm, Daniel!  Must be sarcasm, because surely you wouldn't suggest that America shouldn't stand against a leader who orders an American to be beheaded.  I don't think "Ally" best describes SA anyway...we have mutual interests, that's all (oil<->weapons).
6490 2018-11-22 14:52:49 They won’t be affected! US ki funding aur oil dono band ho jaayengey if they do too much panga
6491 2018-11-22 14:52:47 Trump got his sanctions, through lowering oil prices by 30%.

The left would prefer to harm the poorest nations & grinding the world economy to a halt for someone that didn't have a green card. The media lied about that.
6492 2018-11-22 14:52:47 No, you are one of my fav feeds on hockey much less the Oil. The oilers are one of the must frustrating franchises in all of sports over the last decade. Leafs fans called out their management for over a decade and finally got one with a plan.
6493 2018-11-22 14:52:44 Trump’s Saudi Arabia comments like his Helsinki comments sound like a lot like Neville Chamberlin. Oil, Weapons and Putin in time. Future presidents should need to take and pass a world history test.
6494 2018-11-22 14:52:34 Sure, if you want Big Oil to tell you whats good for you 

You carry on, we would rather have the freedom to choose.
6495 2018-11-22 14:52:30 A man's life is worth more than $0.28 a barrel of oil. I pray our country is waking up an realizing who's for the people an who isn't. So proud to stand with you an AOC an many great others fighting the good fight
6496 2018-11-22 14:52:29 Nah, nothing beats original argan oil . The “low cost” ones can never be the real stuff
6497 2018-11-22 14:52:20 Only 11% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia. Just another lie while you cozy up to a murderer.
6498 2018-11-22 14:52:19 Trump Is Crude. But He’s Right About Saudi Arabia. - The New York Times:CHOOSING THIS PHUK'N AZZHOLE OVER A HUMAN BEING'S LIFE ONLY SHOWS HOW PHUK'N GREEDY YOU "KOCH"-SUKKAS ARE !! We have plenty of OIL right here in the USA, "KOCH"-SUKKAS & WE SHOULD BE OFF  PHUK'N FOSSIL FUELS!
6499 2018-11-22 14:52:14 ね！ズルい！！！！
うちもキャッキャウフフしたい
6500 2018-11-22 14:52:08 The funny thing is, the USA produces more oil than Saudi and the drop is due to US stockpiles and record high US production. So, something he actually could take credit for, he doesn't!
6501 2018-11-22 14:52:07 .
tRUMP on oil imports 

WHAT YOU SAID IS COMPLETE BULLSHIT

We produce MORE oil DOMESTICALLY than Saudi Arabia 
The only oil WE DO IMPORT is from Canada it’s about 11%

tRUMP ENRICHES HIMSELF and claims ITS FOR AMERICA

So I say BULLSHIT .. 

.
6502 2018-11-22 14:52:06 You just sold our soul for a few barrels of oil. Sad.

6506 2018-11-22 14:51:42 I put gloves on and drained the bird over the sink for a long time ensuring that the juices drained from the inside.  I lightly brushed the bird with a mix of grapeseed oil, salt, and pepper, put it on a rack in a roasting pan, and cooked it.  The prep is actually super easy.
6507 2018-11-22 14:51:36 Those policies contribute to catastrophic climate change that will kill thousands every year and cost billions. We can no longer afford to buy or sell oil. We need to invest to decarbonize our economy. It's possible if we work together.

It starts with no more pipelines. Not one.

6510 2018-11-22 14:51:29 While LT outlook for #oil remains bearish (demand weakening & ample supply) in ST narrative is likely to become more +VE & so potential for decent bounce. Inventory drawdowns rather than builds (US maintenance season over), seasonality, louder OPEC voices on prod cuts, etc
6511 2018-11-22 14:51:28 US Sanctions on oil from Iran non existent / Oil glut the result /
6512 2018-11-22 14:51:28 Hey Gillesn

If people in your country are quick happy to be dependent on Big Oil.  Good on you.  

We in UK love freedom.  Freedom to generate our own energy and not have Big Oil tell us how to use energy.
6513 2018-11-22 14:51:22 Need a press org with some teeth. Currently no standards, joining is optional, some complaints may be frivolous, there's a lot of legitimate concerns, disclosures impt like gwyn Morgan's "opinion" column in FP yesterday presented him as oil expert, left out partisan cpc work
6514 2018-11-22 14:51:19 Im prepping shit to fry these turkeys, I grab the fryer and notice oil in it. 

Me: ma.....is this the oil from me frying the turkeys last Thanksgiving??? You dont expect me to use this right, it smells
Ma: it's still good, oil last forever, go ahead
Me: I was adopted wasnt i?
6515 2018-11-22 14:51:03 Sayangnya Migas hanya dan hanya dng US$ that’s “petrodollar” link to oil., non other currencies
6516 2018-11-22 14:51:02 @realDonaldTrump Until full sanctions and full oil sanctions are implemented, I will not go anywhere. Our will is grim, all countries must cut off their oil
6517 2018-11-22 14:51:01 Hey Josh,  Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.  And... Trump calls us a “National Security Threat.”   GTFOH.
6518 2018-11-22 14:50:46 If you chose brussell sprouts, you haven’t had them cooked properly. Olive oil and salt, baked until crispy, delicious!
6519 2018-11-22 14:50:45 More kicking the can down the road. How long does big business need? It must have a turning circle of an oil tanker.
Just let the business tail wag the nation’s dog eh?
Utterly ridiculous. It’s already had way too long already
6520 2018-11-22 14:50:38 あの！おいるは！？失敗したままになってるんでつが！
6521 2018-11-22 14:50:34 To be even clearer: there's no way we can meet climate targets while billions keep being invested in oil and gas new extractions and new gas processing plants.
6522 2018-11-22 14:50:32 It’s the same but we add lots of olive oil to it and have some chicken broth on side to later add it to give it a semi soup like structure

6526 2018-11-22 14:50:08 @JustinTrudeau should stop selling oil to @realDonaldTrump until he confronts Khashoggi's murderers

6528 2018-11-22 14:50:00 A good idea to keep the day job going til you get established.  It means you can be a bit pressurised at times, but indexers are  brilliant at finding time from nowhere (or burning the midnight oil!). I  worked part-time as a librarian and indexer for 5 years  #WIPindex @indexers
6529 2018-11-22 14:49:52 The Saudis butcher a journalist and all you seem happy about is cheaper oil. You no morals whatsoever.
6530 2018-11-22 14:49:41 She failed to defeat the right wing because she is a right wing extremist, everyone saw through her propaganda. The migration crisis we have in europe is due to her neocon war to destabilize libya for oil.
6531 2018-11-22 14:49:41 I'm not disagreeing with your point, just pointing out that unsustainable palm oil can be considered a non-vegan product (and, in my opinion, should be), even though it's plant-based.
6532 2018-11-22 14:49:38 How many murdered journalists, citizens, human rights advocates would have to die before Trump would care more about humans than oil. USA would have to import a ton of empathy and moral backbone to fill the White House which is depleted.
6533 2018-11-22 14:49:33 I do water transfer for hydraulic oil well fracturing.
6534 2018-11-22 14:49:32 Hit the nail on head. Indian Oil Companies increase prices the moment Brent crude price goes up but hold back prices as Brent crude goes down. Their pricing is, on first alarm, increase POL price but hold back  lowering the price to the last  moment.  Worse than blade companies.
6535 2018-11-22 14:49:32 Do you not know that we only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia?
6536 2018-11-22 14:49:19 그런 것 같냐... 그래도 고양이 소리내면 귀여울 것 같냐, 한번 내보실래냐?

6541 2018-11-22 14:48:45 I believe she's truly delusional. Albertans are losing their homes in record numbers, leaving the province and the oil price increase that raised our GDP is now wiped out by the WCS differential NDP caused fiasco.

6547 2018-11-22 14:48:18 But those who rake the leaves at your school are probably struggling to pay the bills, for medication, rent, heating oil, and maybe college for their children. Maybe they are struggling while you privileged schoolboys bask in the lap of luxury. Do something about it. :-) /2

6551 2018-11-22 14:47:49 Absolutely right. The feeling that no one is on the street protesting is no reason for oil companies to sit back and enjoy.
6552 2018-11-22 14:47:48 Happy Thanksgiving! Tips - use our garlic olive oil on the skin of turkey. Put a cup of SB in the bottom of the turkey pan - keeps the bird moist. The Atlas Peak Cab pairs nicely! #garlicoliveoil #winelovers #winetime #atlaspeak #atlaspeakcab #sauvignonblanc #thanksgiving
6553 2018-11-22 14:47:47 Good lord, the only people wanting to buy into Trumps America 
Think you have trouble getting oil to the coasts NOW? Wait until you are trying to get it through California, Oregon, or Washington states
6554 2018-11-22 14:47:44 lol  : )

6556 2018-11-22 14:47:39 The only thing that the movie "Overlord" had going for it was the fact I didn't pay for my ticket, but I was nonetheless disappointed. 1/10 would rather rinse my mouth with motor oil
6557 2018-11-22 14:47:37 And their oil.
6558 2018-11-22 14:47:35 America pumps more oil than Sadui Arabia.  What are you talking about.  You are lining your pockets from Saudi Arabia at America's expense.  That's the issue.
6559 2018-11-22 14:47:31 Merry Turkeyday!  Now, back to our crazy ass February weather. Brought to you by the Oil Industry and their #1 fans, Climate Change Denial Specialists. Controlling what you get pissy about for just over 100 years of destroying your air and water.
6560 2018-11-22 14:47:31 Societé Generale: $EURUSD  still needs to get through 1.1450 to change the short-term technical  picture, so we'll just sit and watch until something happens. $USDJPY is  helped by softer oil and lower  US inflation swaps, but is still  range-bound.

6563 2018-11-22 14:47:24 They told him to take snake oil instead of the antipsychotic meds the doctors prescribed and the court ordered.
6564 2018-11-22 14:47:20 Asparagus, with a light coating of oil and sea salt.

Just my 2 cents.
6565 2018-11-22 14:47:18 @realDonaldTrump Obama 8, you 0. The number of times most recent Pres have visited troops. Times on golf course, you win exponentially. BTW, 40% of our oil comes from Canada, a lot more than what comes from Saudis. I could go on .....
6566 2018-11-22 14:47:09 That's beautiful
6567 2018-11-22 14:47:03 أظن والله أعلم حسن خلقه
6568 2018-11-22 14:47:01 Isn’t it because US upped it oil production too?
6569 2018-11-22 14:46:59 You should work on optimization of crude oil to reduce its demand and its prices.
In fact, You did nothing, just made an artificial price decrease thanks to increased production from Saudis + increasing tension regarding Iran ! It's temporary and hastens #OilCrisis
6570 2018-11-22 14:46:58 はーかわいい
6571 2018-11-22 14:46:58 @realDonaldTrump is thanking the Saudis for helping get him elected and so he can collect his monetary reward from them. Russia probably offered him 19% in Rosnoft Oil.

6573 2018-11-22 14:46:42 And I guess that bailing you out of a few bankruptcies hasn't hurt you either. They have a lot of money invested in you. They own you. They are as corrupt and as dangerous as you are.  What are the kickbacks for all those $billions of purchases, jobs, and oil? Rich get richer.

6575 2018-11-22 14:46:38 The pipeline that sends Canadian oil to the gulf coast for export?

The one that is again tied up in the courts because the President failed to do the due diligence needed to approve it?

That one?
6576 2018-11-22 14:46:35 Apparently mink oil with silicone is really bad for good leathers so it looks like I'm gonna try beeswax or switch to good oil Lexol
6577 2018-11-22 14:46:34 Those bunch of people in a field include Enviro lobby groups funded with millions of dollars, powerful unions like AFL with deep pockets( if they have no influence why do the exist) & FN groups all trying to tie regulatory process up that at least the oil companies respected.
6578 2018-11-22 14:46:28 Do you care to provide any numbers regarding subsidies for oil companies? In Canada, the oil companies pay massive amounts of royalties and  taxes that fund the out of control gov. here. If the tax burdens were relaxed, we'd have less companies going out of business, more jobs.
6579 2018-11-22 14:46:25 or the tory initiated poverty brought on by the austerity measures, while still heavily investing in unnecessary projects and industries such as oil industry subsidies!!
6580 2018-11-22 14:46:25 Interfering in other countries affairs, manuipulating their economies & govts to benefit corporatists & leave ppl starving, relentless war for oil & military coups, dictating what kind of govt other countries can have & destroying them when they dont comply...
6581 2018-11-22 14:46:21 わがやのおいなりさまー
6582 2018-11-22 14:46:17 It will STAY mean & nasty when the Presided of the United States APPROVES of MURDER and DISMEMBERING an INNOCENT HUMAN BEING.
We get LESS than 10% of oil from Saudi Arabia.  You are doing this to save YOUR families ties with Saudi Arabia NOT for America.  LYING S.O.B.
6583 2018-11-22 14:46:11 Clown is comparing two different oil prices that have atleast a $10 spread (WTI vs Brent). Oil Prices have dropped because your trade war tactics are slowing global economic growth and your “sanctions” in Iran are fake.
6584 2018-11-22 14:46:10 Of course once you capped expansion in oil sands new players and capital weren’t their to invest and bring the supply that could have encouraged the pipes. Please tell me your ideology is pure and simply based on a dislike of wealth.
6585 2018-11-22 14:46:04 Disgusting, really was. Down to the flesh with virtually no nail. Even better, it was cold turkey - no nasty tasting liquids. I swear by cuticle oil/serum and lots of hand cream

6592 2018-11-22 14:45:43 Yuppp! Kalau waterproof ni selalunya mmg kena double cleansing la.. Sbb oil cleanser tu boleh hilangkan waterproof make up.. Ni based on what i read la. Nak yakinkan lagi supaya air semayang tu betul2 kena skin. Hehe
6593 2018-11-22 14:45:42 You know you have nothing to do with oil prices! If you don’t understand that, it is even scarier that you are the president. And that is saying a lot.
6594 2018-11-22 14:45:37 And look at how many times even resistors amplified his message of 1 death(not really American) for cheaper oil. The oil being cheaper right now has nothing to do with dumdum.
6595 2018-11-22 14:45:34 We get only 11% of our oil from the Saudis. You're their BFF because of all the money laundering you've provided for them through your Trump Tower condominiums. They have the goods on you so of course you won't do the right thing and condemn them.
6596 2018-11-22 14:45:32 Trump has to be benefiting from the us sales of military equipment why else would he be so brazen about propping up Saudi Arabia’s arms sales oil prices are down to 65$ a barrel??
6597 2018-11-22 14:45:18 Is it just me or are the luxury items being took into the jungle not luxury items, cat teddy, ropes, coconut oil  sort it out
6598 2018-11-22 14:45:13 As an oilfield hand we would love nothing more than removing Saudi Arabia from the crude oil table guaranteeing 100s of thousands of US jobs.
6599 2018-11-22 14:45:07 Thanks for your feedback, I'll be sure to review that figure. However, I think in the final section I've stated quite clearly that boycotting palm oil could exacerbate the problem.
6600 2018-11-22 14:44:59 Most of your oil comes from Canada - so Khashoggi's life was worth nothing to you?
6601 2018-11-22 14:44:58 That “I have caused”. ???  How ?? 

By giving them permission for murder they agreed to lower their oil costs?  Horrible !!
6602 2018-11-22 14:44:58 Wow, you are disgraceful. I'll fix it for you - we get most of our oil from Canada, but you have to protect Saudi Arabia because they give you so much money. A journalist's life, it is what it is. 9/11, well it was years ago...  And you tweet this garbage on Thanksgiving..
6603 2018-11-22 14:44:48 Lost a lifelong friend in Fallujah in 04...was about oil then too. I wish you peace.
6604 2018-11-22 14:44:47 @missmayim Hello cool and smart Mayim.I wonder if you know anything about higher level DHA fish oil supplements actually helping memory & protecting the brain? Are there any other supplements that you know of that help with brain heath? I'm an older student. I do exercise a lot.

6606 2018-11-22 14:44:34 "wind does not generate electricity"
What does that even mean?
Coal doesn't generate electricity.
Oil doesn't generate electricity.
Uranium doesn't generate electricity.
No amount of science-friendly hot air generates electricity.

6608 2018-11-22 14:44:31 Please Don!!!! Don't keep taking credit for lowering the oil prices!!! SAUDIS have very little to do with it!!! But it's Thanksgiving so give your mean remarks a rest today!!
6609 2018-11-22 14:44:31 Oil prices are lower because there is an oversupply in the market. The only thing you’ve contributed is a slowdown in the economy that has brought this on. How’s that stock market going?  You haven’t been chirping about it much at all lately. You’re an ignorant swine.
6610 2018-11-22 14:44:13 Oil as low as the IQ of people who believe Osama did 9/11.
6611 2018-11-22 14:44:07 They supply the US-administration with crude, that you believe come from Iraq. Well it comes from Iran because all the wells in the south has collapsed, and recovery is like sipping juice off a sponge. The US has laid waste the oil in Iraq, and Iranian crude is not for free.
6612 2018-11-22 14:44:07 Every time the media brings up MBS they should mention we only get 11% of oil from Saudi and 40% from Canada.
6613 2018-11-22 14:44:04 put Jamaican castor oil on em before u go to bed n that. It’s only like £5 and they proper make em grow and thicken em

6615 2018-11-22 14:44:02 Happy Thanksgiving from all of us at Fronk Oil!  We are beyond blessed with great customers, employees, and friends!
6616 2018-11-22 14:44:02 I spilled oil on my mf Ugg’s.
6617 2018-11-22 14:44:02 The problem is we need free of dependence on foreign oil! Snow flake Americans Dont want us drilling here. Well, You can’t have it both ways you can’t be the largest consumer of fossil fuel and not be in bed with someone that controls it. End of story!
6618 2018-11-22 14:43:54 agree 100%. i still think Khashogghi murder had something to do with price collapse. oil peaked day he was killed. seemed every day more bad news about it came out, the more the oil selloff accelerated.  might just be coincidence, but that was the day oil and equities topped out
6619 2018-11-22 14:43:48 @Academy Do u even know ur website is DUD ?? It charged my card 7-8 times & kept telling me to re-enter card info. result: card blocked. cant buy your CRAP & missed out on other deals too. pl learn some computer programming. not buyin anythin frm u anymore! @cnn @FoxNews @CNBC
6620 2018-11-22 14:43:44 America gets 40% oil from Canada. What does MBS have on Jared
6621 2018-11-22 14:43:43 Of course not. It also doesn't matter the US gets 40% of their oil imports from Canada who Trump loves to fight with and only 11% from Saudi who he loves no matter who they murder.  No, he doesn't get it and he never will.
6622 2018-11-22 14:43:41 I wish I took a selfie when I first woke up.
My skin is PERFECT!
No break outs for the VERY FIRST time. 
Beautifully hydrated. 
No oil field patches. 
This. Is. A. Miracle.
6623 2018-11-22 14:43:38 羨ましい
6624 2018-11-22 14:43:36 Mr. Trump, you have a problem! It will not disappear like magic. Too many people heard the truth, verse by verse, lies after lies. Saudi Arabia simply cannot be trusted nor can their guilt be compromised for all the oil and jobs in the world! They are cold blooded killers!

6630 2018-11-22 14:43:11 Don't we get more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia?
6631 2018-11-22 14:43:08 The temperatures were not as high, the winds not as strong as often and this information is available even to the slow learners like yourself. You can't manage the fires without doing positive things to fight climate change. Donnie & his coal mines &huge military & oil are bad.
6632 2018-11-22 14:42:49 "sustainable palm oil" is just marketing, as in reality the traceability of palm oil is very limited.
6633 2018-11-22 14:42:43 Ive had a beard for 2 years. The only thing you need is shampoo and oil. Conditioner is a scam, and costs the most money.
6634 2018-11-22 14:42:36 HOW are you going get there?
$24 billion given to foreign countries.
Oil & gas industry worth 11% of GDP killed by Trudeau.
Any plan....?
6635 2018-11-22 14:42:35 @GEJonathan didn't also disclose the decision of awarding Rivers Oil well in Soku to his home-state, Bayelsa and those he 'dashed' Akwa/Ibom&Abia
6636 2018-11-22 14:42:22 Neither. He understands the foundation of the US economy is the petrodollar system. He doesn’t want you to starve to death when oil goes to $300 a barrel and the US dollar free falls in value from placing sanctions on the Saudis. They’ll dump their paper assets asap .
6637 2018-11-22 14:42:20 I vote Democrat is because I think it's better to pay billions of dollars for oil to people who hate us but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, tortoise or fish here in America.  But we don't care about those creatures in those other countries.
6638 2018-11-22 14:42:16 Roasted carrots and brussel sprouts r pretty together. Cut BS in half so they get more flavor. Easy too! Just salt and olive oil.
6639 2018-11-22 14:42:16 He really thinks he controls oil prices. \__/
6640 2018-11-22 14:42:07 @realDonaldTrump "We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs 2 mine 4 fuel & have 2 use sustainable energy eventually, so Y not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies R right is dumbest experiment in history..."
6641 2018-11-22 14:42:07 Thou shall not murder, unless you have oil.  

Thou shall not commit adultery, unless you are rich, oppose abortion, and are willing to appoint conservative Supreme Court Justices.

Thou shall not lie, unless you promise to build walls.

The new values of the Christian right.
6642 2018-11-22 14:42:06 Yes he is a great ally without him and Saudi Arabia their would be a total take over of the Middle East and oil wells. Israel would be no more. Our President is right. To bad what you deep state elites want.  You all love chaos.
6643 2018-11-22 14:42:05 It’s not a glut. It’s a lack of takeaway capacity. It’s a made in Canada blockade of our highest export product. Just returned from the Middle East - no restrictions, no regulation, no carbon tax. They celebrate their oil industry, make no apologies. Canadians are stoopid.
6644 2018-11-22 14:41:59 The only selective outrage against Saudi Arabia is from liberals, media, Dems & a few Repubs. The world doesn't care contrary to what the media would have you believe. World cares to have cheap oil, stable economies, food on the table not the death of a Muslim brotherhood crook
6645 2018-11-22 14:41:57 You are full of gas! Oil was cheaper under Obama! #FuckTrump @POTUS @abbydphillip @AprilDRyan @Acosta @CNN

6647 2018-11-22 14:41:48 I hope all you guys have fun and safe travels knowing your car is running on cheap oil because Saudi Arabia killed an American journalist and they think this makes up for it!
6648 2018-11-22 14:41:41 You forgot to mention these east coast Canadian refineries also rely on US crude oil. Some providences import up to 60% of their crude oil from the us. So, there is that.
6649 2018-11-22 14:41:41 Har jagah bewajah dakhalandazi. 400 crore k liye 33000 crore kharch karna notebandi mai. GST collection increase na hona. Rojgar nhi mile to pakoda politics par utar gye. 50% MUDRA pehle hi NPA ho chuka. Oil prices control mai nhi. Baate badi badi..
6650 2018-11-22 14:41:38 Oil prices are down in large part because demand is down. That is a disturbing economic indicator. Do you understand that?
6651 2018-11-22 14:41:33 I got pills but never tried cbd oil but I’ll see thank you 
6652 2018-11-22 14:41:30 U just want to put oil on the fire. Tell u what. Max is over it. U are not. Max never wants to talk about it again. Unfortunately, all journalists just want to talk about stuff like this. And u just like to make up stories to keep this issue alive. Blimey

6657 2018-11-22 14:41:24 Ouch, that hurts. After they first found oil. That area changed in a big way, became very Rough. There was no infrastructure to handle the population explosion.  A person had to be Damn tough to live there. People were pulling in over six figures $ in the fields.
Hard work.

6659 2018-11-22 14:40:59 Rather than erode health system and education again its worth considering to establish stability not tied to oil
6660 2018-11-22 14:40:55 They hung around in her hacked firewall & a few days later I got a snake oil salesmen Bernie email. Not shocked
6661 2018-11-22 14:40:49 One of the contacts,  Russia supplied northern Iran and power plants there with natural gas in exchange for oil/gas from Southern iranian ports.
6662 2018-11-22 14:40:47 You are gross and sleazy.  Your the one who keeps USA on the market for Saudi oil. The USA was going towards green energy ( non reliance on others)  Instead you side with a butcher of a human. I mean they diced him up with cadaver tools.  Just gross, trump.
6663 2018-11-22 14:40:42 If you are going to give thanks to a country for low oil prices, thank your neighbours to the north. 40% of imported oil comes from CANADA! You are welcome for saving your sorry ass once again. Gaaawd!
6664 2018-11-22 14:40:30 どもども
6665 2018-11-22 14:40:28 Where is intelligence & reason? Why hasn't @CA_Government   restricted imported oil&ensured Canadian oil is available to all of Canada with effort in place to eliminate leaks,spills? Billions in subsidies,no requirements of oil corps.

6668 2018-11-22 14:40:20 #OIL needs to bounce or at least start consolidating into December.

Right on the trend line at present, above that all good. 

If it fails then only have to look at what happened on the monthly chart:

Oct08 147 to 39 (6m)
Jul14 112 to 53 (6m)

Let the trend be your friend 
6669 2018-11-22 14:40:12 The more “oil independence” the US has the more leverage we have in every negotiation.
6670 2018-11-22 14:40:09 The only scientists that "debunk" climate change work for oil companies. And the only ones that believe them are deluded.

6673 2018-11-22 14:39:59 emiya gohan ep where they just feed him to keep him out of troubles..... also how do u make it a non-spicy version if 50% of the ingredients are spicy oil and paste.............

6676 2018-11-22 14:39:50 Let’s start building road systems that convert the weight of cars and trucks into electricity and transmit it wirelessly in charging lanes #end_oil_addiction
6677 2018-11-22 14:39:48 Do it. Baptize that sumbich in peanut oil.
6678 2018-11-22 14:39:39 c’mon, it’s no secret that Big Oil lobbyist r spending millions to spread false narratives about alternative energy sources. Regardless of my rough neck lineage we can have an adult conversation. & yes the market will fix it itself either way look at Tesla. Climate denial is 
6679 2018-11-22 14:39:29 keep and refine the oil here!
6680 2018-11-22 14:39:28 That’s not exactly true. For instance, his stupid decision to initiate sanctions against Iran, taking their oil off market...those kind of actions do affect prices. We get 40% of our oil from Canada, 10% from the Saudis.
6681 2018-11-22 14:39:27 Absolutely, let's see how much oil companies will reduce or throw some crumbs at the consumers.
6682 2018-11-22 14:39:23 @AliVelshi you take that barrel of crude oil back for a refund right now young man!
6683 2018-11-22 14:39:21 You look at the facts, the price of oil went through the floor under the PC government. That is a fact
6684 2018-11-22 14:39:21 Yes it makes me think that statistics without an underlying theory are pointless at best and dangerous at worst because an uneducated population can be easily manipulated into believing whatever snake oil idea is being peddled.
6685 2018-11-22 14:39:18 @IsaacCarew Just caught up with @thismorning OMG, you make your pumpkin soup the same way I do with the lemongrass! I do roast the pumpkin with less oil though, as I don't like to pile on the calories, but I love it with cumin, lemongrass and turmeric! Yum!
6686 2018-11-22 14:39:07 Seeing some of the contraptions people build to lower the turkey into the oil “safely” makes me think this isn’t a safe way to cook a turkey.
6687 2018-11-22 14:39:01 Think of it like Ansible and Chef - while people evaluate Ansible vs Puppet all the time but not Chef because it is so different. They represent different mediums and you know what you like - kinda like oil paint vs sculpting. Potential audience could be very very different.
6688 2018-11-22 14:38:57 The RVO relaxation sounds to me like a knee-jerk reaction to industry complaints about demand destruction in ‘17. It doesn’t address the gallons lost to waiver question, and doesn’t deliver the promised safeguards from Big Oil.
6689 2018-11-22 14:38:48 What happened to American oil independence?? Is the Saudi ruling family America’s friend or the friend of the Trumpery?
6690 2018-11-22 14:38:38 You buy 40% of your oil from Canada and you’re not paying us a fair market price either, robbing us blind!
6691 2018-11-22 14:38:36 Fried with diamond oil
6692 2018-11-22 14:38:32 I vote Democrat because I believe oil companies' profits of 4% on a gallon of gas are obscene, but the government taxing the same gallon at 15% isn't.
6693 2018-11-22 14:38:08 おめでと！
6694 2018-11-22 14:38:08 Oil companies know their products contributed big time so the left isn’t far off.
6695 2018-11-22 14:38:03 You are are the wrong side of this, as usual. Saudi investment is not guaranteed, jobs won't be effected, and we only get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. But they do spend tens of millions of dollars buying your properties and using your hotel.
6696 2018-11-22 14:37:56 No oil...
6697 2018-11-22 14:37:54 Do you even know your website is DUD ????

6698 2018-11-22 14:37:52 Oil being cheap in a shit economy (Obama's) is easy. Oil being cheap in a flourishing economy is a trick...wake up, morons.
6699 2018-11-22 14:37:50 I will be a cheerleader too. When the economical nightmare known as Notley/Trudeau are voted out. Your path of destruction can not be fixed by a last minute vote seeker in regards to heavy oil. Sorry.

Great Song!  :)
6701 2018-11-22 14:37:40 I agree that it's cool they're talking about palm oil, but when they put it in a tweet about eating other animals it reinforces this idea that some animals are for saving, while others for eating.
6702 2018-11-22 14:37:38 So far: 
• Turkey is spatchcocked, dry-brined and the skin is drying in the fridge
• blended olive oil, garlic, rosemary and thyme to coat turkey
• slow-roasting sweet potatoes for later mashing 
• watching the annual Broadway advertisement parade
6703 2018-11-22 14:37:34 Not enough agricultural land in Europe to grow these alternative oils to replace EU consumption of palm oil. In other words, not a solution at global scale. And not a solution for countries like Indonesia and Malaysia where these oils cannot be cultivated.
6704 2018-11-22 14:37:28 when a permanent legal resident of the U.S. can be viciously killed and we have almost no response because they give us oil.....the humanity in this country continues to deplete and so does our standing in the world

6706 2018-11-22 14:37:25 so the alternative to green energy, which somehow the post doesnt like, is oil. a finite resource thats drying up fast. lets do that then right?
6707 2018-11-22 14:37:22 Madrid don't have oil money
6708 2018-11-22 14:37:21 sana oil bro
6709 2018-11-22 14:37:19 Bull sh*t. US went in under the lie of WMDs (it was actually about the oil) & never had a plan to back out of the wars. The US butted into conflicts that were ongoing for thousands of years. Did we solve anything? No. US made things worse. Installed governments that are failing.
6710 2018-11-22 14:37:19 So I guess it’s only money and selling weapons that count and not people’s lives. You only care about the Middle East when your sucking the oil out and selling them weapons to kill each other off.
6711 2018-11-22 14:37:16 Yes, Thanks Saudia Arabia. The Yemini's appreciate lower oil prices for America while their children starve to death. Hooray for Saudi Arabia and Trump's America First agenda.
6712 2018-11-22 14:37:14 Feeling this. So sophomore in high school. Next I'll be using Manic Panic and clove oil perfume. #boys

6714 2018-11-22 14:37:13 Disconcerting that @realDonaldTrump thinks that Saudis control our oil prices.
6715 2018-11-22 14:37:12 One has to wonder whether or not the oil price reduction Trump is crowing over was paid for with Jamal Khashoggi's blood

6718 2018-11-22 14:37:08 That's right. It's possible that the arrows refer to the oil & gas exchange deals between Iran and Russia that Russia takes oil to Iran from one end to sell to its customers and receive from another. In this process Iran own oil can be claimed as Russian
6719 2018-11-22 14:37:07 나도 그런 것 같냐
6720 2018-11-22 14:37:02 More “Fake News” from the great Trumpet goodness he’s worse than a snake oil salesman
6721 2018-11-22 14:37:02 oil analyst on TV yesterday made a great statement "its impossible to do fundamental analysis on oil right now."  its true, price is being manipulated by everyone for political purposes, just like all asset mkts since the financial crisis.
6722 2018-11-22 14:36:51 Sorry world till the world doesn't need oil. SA will have some power of all economies. Sad how they did it. But, keep your enemies closer.

6726 2018-11-22 14:36:21 I would definitely agree that #WinterIsHere  Advice(from Daily Express - Warm up for Wintry Roads 21/11/18) is to check tyres, have winter breakdown kit, clear ice and snow off , keep oil topped up, get your heater checked, keep an eye on the weather @TheRAC_UK @yourmechanic
6727 2018-11-22 14:36:18 Canada oil exports to USA are almost double what Saudi Arabia exports to USA.
Why doesn't @realDonaldTrump thank Canada (and Venezuela) for keeping American gas prices low.
6728 2018-11-22 14:36:13 Trump shud thank our IDIOT PM Trudeau!  Because of him, US gets a 75% discount on our oil!
6729 2018-11-22 14:36:03 Ironically, there’s no need, most oil Americans use is produced domestically. Of the imports, 40% comes from Canada, 11% from Saudi Arabia, 9% from Venezuela, 8% from Mexico. So the big takeaway, stop with the silly steel tariffs, we don’t embargo your oil, that’s not nice.
6730 2018-11-22 14:36:03 Back in the mid 00s, Venezuela offered to send solidarity support teams to help the socialists that were campaigning against the right wing Oz govt.  They did a deal for cheap oil to help London & swapped oil for Cuban doctors. Venezuela deserves all the help we can give.
6731 2018-11-22 14:35:59 By the way Don. We get 40% of our imported oil from Canada, 11% from murderous Saudi Arabia.  50% of our imported oil comes from North and South America. About 60% of the oil we consume is produced in the US. Fck the Saudis we don’t need them.
6732 2018-11-22 14:35:58 Classic authoritarian dictator - the world is a scary place and only I can protect you. PS-only 11% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia. 40% comes from Canada, the country you keep disrespecting.

6744 2018-11-22 14:35:04 In a Mediterranean diet, the major fat source is olive oil which has a lot of Monounsaturated fatty acids, and has phenolic compounds. Those two substances are anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. They can increase HDL-C, reduce triglycerides levels and systolic blood pressure.
6745 2018-11-22 14:34:57 Saudi arabia is just a convenience ally, and a very bad one at that, and muricans let them violate human rights all day because muh oil

Crude Oil Prices were $52.75 per barrel when he assumed office in January 2017...It's $54.70 per barrel now.

Big whoop.....

6757 2018-11-22 14:33:42 Notice that the price of oil has dropped dramatically since the murder? Trump is extorting the Saudi's into lowering the price of oil. Brilliant!

6760 2018-11-22 14:33:31 Regarding #Trump painting himself in a corner, He is known to flip flop faster than Obama in a dryer machine on high speed.   US Coast guard intercepting oil shipments? It would require the US coast guard to go 1000s miles away from the US border?!
6761 2018-11-22 14:33:29 With the involvement of the president. Oil bearing countries lower the cost of crude oil, which in turn makes gasoline cheaper.
Apparently you thought you had something to do with lower gas prices

6765 2018-11-22 14:33:09 Moreover, he has significantly reduced the prices of the oil while France is giving excuses by saying that theyll create a less poluted environment when they dont want to face the increasement of petrol by the next year.
6766 2018-11-22 14:32:51 Whay happened to going green and creating jobs in the global climate friendly manufacturing??? This oil bullshit is evil and only feeds the mega wealtjy. The world needs to organize and LOCK UP ALL CORRUPT BILLIONAIRES!!! obviously including ring leader Trump.
6767 2018-11-22 14:32:47 America receives majority of its oil from Canada not #SaudiArabia. I believe we only get 9% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. So your support of the Crown Prince killing an American journalist it's about your own self-interest

6769 2018-11-22 14:32:40 Canada should be thanked as most of our oil comes from there. And oil prices are higher this year than last year.

6771 2018-11-22 14:32:29 How many times did Obama and Clinton lie to the American public. The Iran deal was a lie that has cost lives and with an extra $160 billion plus able to sell oil it will cost thousands of innocent lives. More Israelis and others will die do to the deal.

6775 2018-11-22 14:32:18 I'll take it.  My gas is lower, and my oil is $1/gallon less than at this time last year.  Thank you for another raise President Trump
6776 2018-11-22 14:32:10 Every one knows that killer "bring me head of that dog" but oil in, honor out in the world.
6777 2018-11-22 14:32:02 We here in the oil producing state of Oklahoma say thanks for lowering oil prices. Looks like another teacher Walkout coming.
6778 2018-11-22 14:32:01 America imports more oil from Canada than from Saudi Arabia.  FACT 
So why not thank Canada for helping you have lower gas prices?
6779 2018-11-22 14:32:00 Such “outrage” over a non citizen.  What do you want USA to do?  Stop buying oil???  Want $10 gallon at the pump???

6781 2018-11-22 14:31:57 printing money causes the USD to weaken and commodities to strenghten. Oil is a commodity and it's pegged the dollar. Right now our dollar is strong so oil is falling, as is the stock market. Things will reset. The prez is doing a fine job. Relax. Things will be ok.

6783 2018-11-22 14:31:54 Trump is damned either way—if he acted and oil spiked the media and the rest of the left would be outraged. What about the attacks on civilians in Israel nothing from the media but a journalist killed it is the end of the world.
6784 2018-11-22 14:31:43 After working in oil & gas industry, I have realised that we humans are very selfish and can do anything to earth to sustain our race in the industrial world. #oilandgas #oilspill #earth
6785 2018-11-22 14:31:37 Except Canada supplies 40% of American oil and Saudies only 10%......so your welcome I guess.....
6786 2018-11-22 14:31:24 Funny how China has stopped buying oil from USA but your friends the Saudis are selling them oil. Comments please Pinocchio
6787 2018-11-22 14:31:22 人気出るかな〜笑 すみりんは一歩大人だったからリアクションするまでもないかなーみたいな感覚かな？
6788 2018-11-22 14:31:17 LOL.
Trump's sanction was for SA to lower oil prices by 30%.
Your idea of sanction would have harmed the poorest countries of the world the most.
6789 2018-11-22 14:31:10 Said it a 1000x, biggest mistake Chiarelli made as #Oilers GM was to overreact to the the '15-'16 campaign.

6804 2018-11-22 14:30:08 This WH has no morality. They care  more about money than morality. A Washington Post Reporter murdered and dismembered and that's ok? Oil is a finite resource & they use this excuse for murder,slaughter,murder, gas prices. Oh that's right it's about his tacky hotels.

6808 2018-11-22 14:29:55 we get most of our oil from Canada...not Saudi Arabia. But potus is justifying murdering journalists for low gas prices.
6809 2018-11-22 14:29:53 How much lower did the dismembered journalist drive the oil?
6810 2018-11-22 14:29:51 There's a glut on the market. Selling oil for below the cost of extracting it is stoopid.
6811 2018-11-22 14:29:49 Indeed but in Europe the ROI is huge. Cleaner climate, reduce/eliminate oil importations and all that implies and Major tech development that would assure thriving car industry for the Next decades. But no, it's usa (Tesla) and china.

^Ahmad
6816 2018-11-22 14:29:19 Interesting , meaning all the thousands that worked in the oil industry since the beginning of the short changing kept quiet?
6817 2018-11-22 14:29:15 Actually, Clipper gets to tidewater in the Gulf Coast through a full path using Seaway and Flanagan lines. We are exporting Cdn oil from Port Arthur Texas. Anchor Loop was an expansion of Kinder Morgan’s west coast pipeline and Line 9 goes to Montreal and could access tidewater
6818 2018-11-22 14:29:02 If Faux actually did research, they’d find its mostly due to our overflowing stockpiles that are decreasing shipments and thusly driving down prices. And that we get more oil from Canada then from Saudi Arabia. But hey...

6822 2018-11-22 14:28:45 Does he "work" in the Oil Industry and will you be wearing a hajib even after the nuptials?
6823 2018-11-22 14:28:41 The beginning of the market crash has oil prices plunging, not #Trump.  If anyone is to blame/thank, it's  the Fed and their rate hikes which have now pricked the Everything bubble.
6824 2018-11-22 14:28:38 We are, unfortunately, the largest oil producer in the world, and export (Exxon $$$) much of it, and import from SA. Drilling for energy independence is horseshit. It's all about greed.
6825 2018-11-22 14:28:28 This morning, I was reading the news and I realised that Macron pointed out that in France it will be created a much safer and less poluted environment but the issue is that petrol and oil will increase by the next year, therefore, theres a big incongruence here
6826 2018-11-22 14:28:28 sana oil
6827 2018-11-22 14:28:27 Maybe you’ve hit on the answer. Diss Canada , reduce oil imports and buy more from Saudi because they’re our new besties.
6828 2018-11-22 14:28:22 Thank you Katy.  You're such an amazing person.  I have been using the oil you gave me and truly feel the Goddess energy!  
6829 2018-11-22 14:28:17 Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
6830 2018-11-22 14:28:17 If we have some elections every 3 months then there won't be any fuel price increase and the oil marketing companies would become bankrupt

It should go without saying, but low oil prices ALSO do not justify the murder of even one person.

6840 2018-11-22 14:27:05 @realDonaldTrump , do you have any economist in the White-House at all? Oil is going down because the world is preparing for an imminent economic slowdown and possibly a crash, not because of sheikhs in Saudi Arabia! Next thing to go down is US equity market, buckle up!

6849 2018-11-22 14:26:44 It will probably be counted by the fall in the global price for oil. In essence, the price shouldn't really change by much
6850 2018-11-22 14:26:42 Doesn't the overall price of oil drop dramatically every year around this time due to usage worldwide?
6851 2018-11-22 14:26:35 What happened to being energy independent?   What happened the last time we had to rely on Middle East Oil?
6852 2018-11-22 14:26:31 That outrage has been there for a very long time. It's just now being acknowledged, so it has to wade through mockery and debate before some folks will legitimize it. This "anything is acceptable because oil" world we have is teetering.
6853 2018-11-22 14:26:30 Will they allow you to import a Cajun turkey fryer, and can you get peanut oil in Europe? (You just have to be very, VERY careful in using them.)
6854 2018-11-22 14:26:28 I think there would be a spate of instances here of people flinging boiling oil at each other.
6855 2018-11-22 14:26:28 Having to balance being an artist and a businessman is no easy task. Youre mixing oil with water. 
6856 2018-11-22 14:26:23 I'm really pissed that the MSM is not making it completely clear that @realDonaldTrump has no way of keeping oil prices down. I'm just so done with the BS bleeding from his everywhere.

6858 2018-11-22 14:26:11 At least he thanks a country that murders journalists and and only supplies 11% of oil imports, but that 450 billion is going to trickle down, so we have that going for us.
6859 2018-11-22 14:26:00 I have on multiple layers and I have seen several people in tanks and shorts. Real feel of 19 out makes me like the tin man needing oil, running.
6860 2018-11-22 14:26:00 If you're baking it might actually come out better with coconut oil! Like pie crusts are better made with coconut oil vs. Earth balance.
6861 2018-11-22 14:25:56 Interesting doing your post on a moving train, either diesel or electric which is produced by at least 40% Gas, into your phone (40% made from oil & Gas). Better sit back down on your plastic chair and look out of your glass window produced using GAS at high temperatures.
6862 2018-11-22 14:25:49 Better to drill mars than here, whole new spin on nimby ... regardless, king oil is still a dirtbag

And mine those asteroids ...
6863 2018-11-22 14:25:46 They need us more than we need them.  We get way more oil from Canada!  They sent us most of the 9/11 hijackers.  They are starving children in Yemen.  Not nice people.  Allies for that region at best.
6864 2018-11-22 14:25:42 A "Niagara" of oil?
6865 2018-11-22 14:25:38 Yeah I saw dat shit mouth Trump rejoicing on twitter today that oil prices are dropping..if that continues then we will be in trouble again
6866 2018-11-22 14:25:35 I agree. Personally I believe it goes even deeper than that. I believe there are other interest being served that helped. Oil, Arms, Israel, the war machine, regime change, restoration and strengthening of American Hegemony. Cheney and his crew of neo-cons began with 
6867 2018-11-22 14:25:35 International oil price dipping. Remember Trump tweet last night?

6875 2018-11-22 14:25:08 Found out I have oil preheater when I pulled cowl off for annual.  So now trying to figure out remote control on/off switch to turn it on for flying days.
6876 2018-11-22 14:25:05 If a president really believes he's personally to be credited with keeping oil prices down, he is legitimately delusional and in need of a psychiatric evaluation, for the safety of our country.

But roughly 10% of your oil supply - and present/future cash/business deals with shady Arabs - and that's vital to national security?

6896 2018-11-22 14:23:56 Where US imports oil or whether they import at all has nothing to do with price of oil. Maybe Canada will continue selling oil at a deep discount even if the price goes to150$
6897 2018-11-22 14:23:55 And the will is lacking.  We subsidized the growth of the oil industry in the 1920s....
6898 2018-11-22 14:23:54 Why can't they ask for compensation? Fossils will take a  million years before it could become oil.
6899 2018-11-22 14:23:53 My car is finally dead, loads of smoke pouring out the bonnet as I pulled up at home, went to check and seems the oil and what ever elese has exploded.....
6900 2018-11-22 14:23:51 Again, them giving us cheap oil and driving the price down hurts American jobs...that is not America First.
6901 2018-11-22 14:23:46 Nat Geographic talking about we're ALREADY fighting over Mars?!!

Environmentalists want to PRESERVE Mars, as it is! (Geez! It's a DEAD planet?)

New "Boogie Man"? Old Big Oil Companies.. Wanting to DRILL Mars to pieces!?

CAN we all agree.. There's NO OIL on Mars!!!?
6902 2018-11-22 14:23:34 @realDonaldTrump  give it a break. You did not bring down oil prices, they were inflated because YOUR friends reduced production. Traffic issues involve infrastructure + families wanting to be togeher, a perrfect storm. Do your job improve infrasture isses in bipartisan bill.
6903 2018-11-22 14:23:12 Ouchies son... you kill snails with it not cook em with it gotta have the truffle oil hun
6904 2018-11-22 14:23:06 What does one have to do with the other? You had NOTHING to do with Saudi Arabia having lower oil prices, which affect our gas prices unless...unless you are giving them a pass for murdering the Washington post journalist & they are lowering the prices in kind, then I understand.

6907 2018-11-22 14:22:57 No, you are not causing traffic jams.  But, you also, are not reducing the price of gas.

You say we are the world's highest producer of oil, yet, somehow Saudis have the ability to change prices.  I would think it would be USA now.........  odd.

6915 2018-11-22 14:22:08 My real point is that Trump does not care about other humans except if he sees an opportunity to gloat about being better or winning & making them "losers" he can insult or recieving flattery & applause from them.
But I do believe we should move away from dep on oil ASAP.
6916 2018-11-22 14:22:03 It's ok.  My oil I just hot yesterday was $1 less per gallon than last year at this time.  Thank you President Trump.  It"s like I just got another raise!
6917 2018-11-22 14:22:03 Again, where is the utopian candidate that would go to war with Saudi Arabia? Obama had eight years to do that. The oil is too valuable.

Trump called Kashoggi an infidel and a blasphemer? Interesting.
6918 2018-11-22 14:22:02 Mint oil under the nose
6919 2018-11-22 14:21:59 This is short term thinking. This will be catastrophic to oil service companies. When the artificial lower prices go back up there will be a 1 to 2 year lag getting back up and running. Oil prices will sky rocket. Better hope this didn’t happen in 2020.
6920 2018-11-22 14:21:40 More reduced Saudi oil prices...
6921 2018-11-22 14:21:40 There's a glut of oil.  That's why prices are lower.  It happens all the time and you have nothing to do with it.  Duh.

6925 2018-11-22 14:21:24 The purpose of energy independence was to free ourselves from the Middle East and their troubles. We receive 40% of our oil from Canada, more than from the Saudis. Our 3rd largest importer is  México. We should be treating them better.
6926 2018-11-22 14:21:22 This sounds more like Saudi Arabia first.  We get less and less oil from Saudi every year.  Stop letting these Barbarians control the world.  We need to convert to renewable energy sources.  We need more solar power and electric, hydrogen, and natural gas cars.

6942 2018-11-22 14:20:28 It’s important we get to responsibly-produced palm oil. The campaign against palm oil, which’s production causes deforestation is laudable, but the distinction has to be made — otherwise we hurt farmers/producers who produce responsibly. Thinking of farmers in Ghana.
6943 2018-11-22 14:20:24 Hey Donny,

Would you feel differently about Saudi jobs & oil if MBS had murdered, dismembered, and dissolved one of your relatives?
6944 2018-11-22 14:20:23 Dropping bombs and causing turmoil in the Middle East will cause oil to rise, not fall. You don't even understand the basics about energy so you shouldn't be tweeting about it at all. 
We should build more nuclear power plants and yes keep investing in clear energy.
6945 2018-11-22 14:20:18 I heard a theory that 45 made a deal w/the Saudis-if they open the oil spigots and make the price of oil drop, he wouldn’t condemn their sadist killing of a WAPO journalist.

6975 2018-11-22 14:18:27 Forget about the "lower oil prices", and "big tax cut" bullshit.
"We" can't go lower! You are, on a  personal level, as low as we can go.
6976 2018-11-22 14:18:24 Is R.S.O. oil an option for you guys??? many people have had very positive results including  cures... I'm sure your have heard of Rick Simpson...
6977 2018-11-22 14:18:18 Saudi Arabia has not just started being corrupt, they have always been against our values, they likely funded 911 and other extreme terrorist ideas.  The don't tolerate gays, transgender, LGBT  or women rights, they execute people in the streets.  They have oil, it's a fact
6978 2018-11-22 14:18:18 I want good things for the home team.  Don’t get me wrong.  Hoping this helps.
6979 2018-11-22 14:18:14 Actually the price of oil is still higher than the day you took office. Just more lies from the #OrangeMoron.
6980 2018-11-22 14:18:14 So the 6 billion that consume 100 million barrels a day are giving up oil? Demand is forecast to increase to 2040. Its only Canadian oil that is blockaded by our own who prefer to support Saudi Princes, Russian Oligarchs and Trump. Transfer of $80 million a day to Trump. Thx

6982 2018-11-22 14:18:05 We're out of peanut oil too guess the bird can go in the oven
6983 2018-11-22 14:18:05 We get 7% of our oil from Saudi. The billions of dollars will come over dozens of years and no one will lose their jobs if we block a trade deal that hasn't even started yet. You are such an ass.
6984 2018-11-22 14:17:54 And so it begins.  2/3 of a turduckhen...they'll be boiled in oil for their crimes.  But later.
6985 2018-11-22 14:17:43 Starting on FEDERAL LAND you'd think Mr. I Alone Can Fix It would have fixed it.  But no.  Since he couldn't put hotels there or drill for oil, why bother.  Get your rake out and shut up.
6986 2018-11-22 14:17:42 nah.  Tough subject to cover as of late.  Frustrating indeed.   Somebody’s gotta state the facts.  My ass doesn’t benefit from sunshine being jammed up there.  THEY FIRED THE WRONG GUY!!!   Good for T. Mac. hitchin a ride on a life raft before this ship creaters
6987 2018-11-22 14:17:39 Don’t disagree with you there. But they’ll cut off our oil supply in a nano-second and Americans will blame Trump because we’re paying $8.00 per gallon at the pump and airlines will go bust. The US is too spoiled to go without. It would be like the apocalypse

6989 2018-11-22 14:17:26 YOU are not the one who lowered oil prices. YOU are FAKE, not news media
6990 2018-11-22 14:17:24 You can disagree, but the figures are just the same. And available to check. 'A cubic mile of oil' for instance, is packed with hard data about global energy needs now and into the future. And how little impact everything that isn't fossil fuel is having.
6991 2018-11-22 14:17:24 Fresh fruit or veggie platter (with hummus) if not cooking. If you want to cook, stick to simple whole foods - roast some root veggies with olive oil/pepper/salt; steamed rice with coconut oil/butter; fresh salad - greens, veggies, nuts, seeds with an olive oil/lemon dressing.

7000 2018-11-22 14:16:49 You do realize that you get 40% of your oil from Canada and only 11% from Saudi Arabia right
7001 2018-11-22 14:16:46 The Kool-Ade tastes great, huh?

God is not American. The US military isn’ protecting anyone’s freedom except the banks & multinationals who want access to oil & political control over Third World countries. It’s all a myth & it’s all going to destroy God’s creation — & you & me.
7002 2018-11-22 14:16:44 Nope.  We don't sell our values.

For oil or anything else.

And this isn't about oil for you -- it's about the fact that Saudi Arabia is bribing you PERSONALLY.
7003 2018-11-22 14:16:37 They aren't covering it bc it has absolutely nothing to do with you. Dude your ego is absolutely insane. Presidents have no control over oil prices. It's a supply and demand issue. Thought you would have known that with the "great education" you got from Wharton.

7032 2018-11-22 14:14:50 This week, of my 34th year of life, is when I learned that a little too much tea tree oil can burn you. 

Who'd have thought?
7033 2018-11-22 14:14:40 You do realize that we get most of our oil from Canada, right?  And that the Saudis don’t unilaterally set oil prices, right?  Oh wait, facts. I forgot you just make ish up and facts don’t matter. Resign.
7034 2018-11-22 14:14:36 You LOVE FAKE NEWS!  No one is talking about this. You have no control on oil prices nor do the Arabs. It's more expensive to drive this year. Your buddy Kim was right: dotard!
7035 2018-11-22 14:14:35 This is a huge step... cant wait to see them roll this out - best place to start as gas is hugely expensive in Europe where they really don’t have oil interests
7036 2018-11-22 14:14:30 This is what happens when you replace real science advisors with oil industry reps. You don’t know shit.
7037 2018-11-22 14:14:28 His original cabinet was made up of big oil people.  That makes me ask, isn’t it concerning that he goes thru cabinet members faster than college kids go thru beer the night before Thanksgiving?  He’s not really draining the swamp, he hired all of his cabinet.

7042 2018-11-22 14:13:53 This is literally #fakenews. You’ve had nothing to do with current gas prices, but oil is a bear commodity market and Saudi Arabia is cutting production right now to get crude prices to rise again. You’ve done nothing about it but thank them.
7043 2018-11-22 14:13:28 Saudi Arabia has nothing to do w/oil pricing,or very little,as we only import 11% of our oil from them! Nice try at BSing Americans again @realDonaldTrump ,but no cigar you pathological liar!! Now do your job, and sanction  for ordering assassination of US journalist!

7047 2018-11-22 14:13:16 You didn’t cause “lower gas prices.” The price of oil per barrel fell - in part - because of growing fears over an economic slowdown and the impact those concerns are having on the broader stock market. 
Your ignorance never ceases to amaze.

7077 2018-11-22 14:11:36 They are great books. There’s SO much to read about all the facets of reading. There’s a lot of snake oil books and research too. It can be overwhelming to navigate!
7078 2018-11-22 14:11:35 This i understand, my major concern comes from the fact that should the opposite happen and oil prices rise, as seen previously, they would increase prices promptly. When the opposite happens we never quite see a reduction.

7090 2018-11-22 14:10:44 There’s an Arabic dish like that - you boil endive and then strain it, add oil and lemon and presto! - a salad, the name of which is kinda hard to spell. Problem is, you have to use a lot of endive because once you boil and stain the hell out of it, there’s not much left.
7091 2018-11-22 14:10:41 I think there’s olive oil on the asparagus and then parm. Broiled it all on low, in the middle of the oven. (You could I assume roast the asparagus separately and then add parm and broil quickly, but he did it all together. Took about 10 min? Ish?)
7092 2018-11-22 14:10:37 Drop bombs on Iran see where oil goes. Release a fraction of our massive reserves and see where oil goes and then tell me the Prez has no power over crude prices.
However limited, the US president has more control over oil prices than anyone. The article is absurd.

7096 2018-11-22 14:10:27 So murder by a personal friend of yours for cheap oil is ok. For those trumpists out there the price is set by supply and demand. Isn't that why we are letting oil leak from 2 new pipelines in our Midwest.
7097 2018-11-22 14:10:25 This is true, and hypocritical, but not analogous.  We're not got going to get blown off by the Saudis if they want to buy arms, and they aren't going to artificially inflate the price of oil, so Trump was speaking out of ignorance as usual.

7102 2018-11-22 14:10:00 In my view racism is where a person is judged solely by their color, religion, ethnic background.   When political views are different vs someone like Obama could it be the views are flawed not racist, like no oil in America.  Like it or not we burn oil.
7103 2018-11-22 14:09:47 You’re a moral Pygmy who’s willing to let the Saudis get away with murder (for an arm sale signed by Obama, not you).

Lower oil prices are due more to increases in the value of the dollar and expansion of oil shale and offshore drilling by U.S. companies.
7104 2018-11-22 14:09:20 One thing we should all remember-yes, the Saudis are getting away with murder on a colossal scale. Yes, Trump's remarks are pathetically craven. Yet, the Saudis are in the end indulged clients, and in their influence on U.S. policy, nothing next to the oil and gas lobby.
7105 2018-11-22 14:09:11 Never trust a female who doesn’t keep vegetable oil in the house
7106 2018-11-22 14:09:09 You have no effect on the price of oil, big mouth. LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!
7107 2018-11-22 14:09:05 Another genius...Canada has plenty of refineries to supply their own oil
7108 2018-11-22 14:08:54 Consider that American imports 11% of it's oil from Saudi Arabia and 40% from Canada......Canada gets kicked in the teeth, Saudi Arabia get a free pass on murder, so if it isn't a personal Trump financial interest I would really like to know what.
7109 2018-11-22 14:08:35 Balik oil pastel na ako
7110 2018-11-22 14:08:31 That is amazing! We hosted an early family Thanksgiving on the 10th. Roasted one and fried one and, you’re right, dealing with the oil wasn’t pleasant. I’m sure yours will be delicious and I hope you have a truly wonderful day with your family. Happy Thanksgiving

7112 2018-11-22 14:08:26 Sarap talaga mag oil pastel paint ng sunset 
7113 2018-11-22 14:08:26 But they have beautiful money and look at all the oil.  We can’t upset them can we?   @realDonaldTrump
7114 2018-11-22 14:08:24 CANCER IS NOT DEADLY 

and drink it for about 1-3 months first thing before food and cancer would disappear, research by Maryland College of Medicine says, it's 1000 times better than chemotherapy. (3). Third step is to drink 3 spoonfuls of organic coconut oil, morning and night

7120 2018-11-22 14:08:10 tried lavender essential oil for the first time to try to sleep better, and instead i have a nightmare that @JesseMcCartney stalked me and tried to break into my house, followed by a dream that i was stuck on a bus with @THESLUMPGOD (that one i wish was real LOL)
7121 2018-11-22 14:08:05 Why a grain Conveyor? Check the huge problems presently mounting to ship prairie grain. You know that the railways could not get the grain harvests to critical world markets for the past 5 years, and presently last year's harvest remains in silos, unable to be shipped. Oil also.
7122 2018-11-22 14:07:55 Crude Oil (BLCO) is currently available #crude #oils #availability
7123 2018-11-22 14:07:55 I say build a pipeline first and then when you reap the benefits of moving our oil to market... use that money to build a 21c house for the PM... until then.. don’t spend a nickel of my money!
7124 2018-11-22 14:07:53 You can’t lower gas prices any more or less than every other President! I can’t believe you’re trying to take credit for this. Worldwide demand fluctuates, supply differs, economies slow down. Dozens of factors influence oil prices. Are you gonna take credit for the sun rising?
7125 2018-11-22 14:07:49 Would love to be rubbing oil over you
7126 2018-11-22 14:07:47 No worries, we sacrificed a journalist to the oil gods. Prices should go down soon
7127 2018-11-22 14:07:46 Yet Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
7128 2018-11-22 14:07:46 You don't need one. Take any pan big enough to fit the bird, cover it with foil if it doesn't have a lid or if it's too short. Rub the skin with olive oil before you put it in, cook it (unstuffed) for 15 minutes per lb at 325. Did that yesterday, turned out PERFECT!
7129 2018-11-22 14:07:43 Yes, the oil companies are so weak that a bunch of people in a field scared them away right?
7130 2018-11-22 14:07:37 @shanedawson tried and true happed lip helps: Do a lip scrub. Apply Aquafor lip balm, yes to coconut lip oil, or lip balm., or a combo  every time they feel dry, and drink as much water as possible.  I am chronically dehydrated due to gastric bypass, my lips suffer for it.
7131 2018-11-22 14:07:34 Oh dear. You realise you hav next to no economy and have been bankrolled for decades by the ruk? Where do you think your money comes from? North sea oil? Who says that's yours
7132 2018-11-22 14:07:32 So did he have nothing to do with oil prices or did he drive them up?  Another horse crap opinion Markets to bash the president. Futures market impacts oil prices, trumps conjecture also has impact.  You have no impact
7133 2018-11-22 14:07:19 Interesting, so you’re saying Foreign countries can murder with impunity as long as they provide cheap oil and buy Billions of military hardware. Well at least now they know what your price is.
7134 2018-11-22 14:07:19 Por tal motivo mañana aumenta la nafta el gas oil y la luz.... cualquier excusa es valida para aumentar
7135 2018-11-22 14:07:17 New Coke versus Deep-fried Turkey:

SIMILARITIES: Pointless innovation. Made decent products taste worse.

DIFFERENCES: New Coke didn’t require consumers to waste vast amounts of peanut oil. New Coke never engulfed consumers or houses in flames.
7136 2018-11-22 14:07:17 Only reason we’re keeping friendly with the Saudis is so oil doesn’t go back to $100+ a barrel. That’s something I don’t think anyone wants because it effects every aspect of society. I do dislike the Saudi’s on many aspects but they are better as “allies” than enemies.
7137 2018-11-22 14:07:13 Baby oil ช่วยเราได้จริงว่ะ ผิวนุ่มลื่นไปเลย เออแต่อย่าทาเยอะน้าาาาาาา ทาโลชั่นทับด้วยนิดๆจะดีเลย
7138 2018-11-22 14:07:13 But,govt should keep eye on oil companies.

They are one's who actually manipulating pricing.

Intl prices,hv come down by 25% in 1 month.But,domestic prices reduced only by 10%

With check on companies,it will help govt only to increase or decrease duty as per market situation
7139 2018-11-22 14:07:09 Epp me ma, I want oil gig. Plis
7140 2018-11-22 14:07:04 Half of oil production in the US would not be profitable if it weren't for US government subsidies. Subsidies in Canada are just as bad.

7142 2018-11-22 14:07:01 it's worse than just oil and arms, he has benefited personally and been enriched by Saudi money
7143 2018-11-22 14:06:55 Someone claiming we know each other called me that I should apply for a job with an oil company in PH with a pretty salary.
But the application  form is #25,000 naira.

7151 2018-11-22 14:06:13 Hi !
Usually if tumbuh tmpat sama is sbb the root tak keluar habis. Mknanya bila jerawat tu "baik" sbnrnya dia still ada lg dlm kulit.

Cara terbaik is :
- Stop picking on yr zits.
- Rajin buat deep cleansing routine (clay mask, oil cleanse).
- Spot treat.
- Jaga diet & hygiene.

7153 2018-11-22 14:06:07 Lol thanks for the explanation dopey. I said printing money will cause upward pressure on oil. That's because it will weaken the USD. Learn to read while you're at it.
7154 2018-11-22 14:06:06 This nation gets most of its oil from Canada. Only 11% of our oil comes from the murderers in Saudi Arabia. This country can do without Saudi Arabia even if you can't.
7155 2018-11-22 14:05:54 American lives are more important than Saudi oil
7156 2018-11-22 14:05:48 Haven't yet heard Bernie discuss his policy on containing china, countering the silk road trade areas, wresting control of sub-Saharan africa from China, alleviating Europe's dependence on Putin's oil etc. He's got a lot to say about healthcare though. He's not a complete package
7157 2018-11-22 14:05:42 The Saudis butchered a lovely journalist and Trump is thanking them for oil prices.
7158 2018-11-22 14:05:38 But Harper did NOT get Oil/pipelines to tidewater!

7159 2018-11-22 14:05:37 Would be nice if that oil boom kept going.
7160 2018-11-22 14:05:30 So as in Iraqi, there were many casualties while looking for weapons which were never there. All along what they really wanted was oil and now they have it. Lapha emzansi, this state capture circus is yet another decoy for these Devils to have full control over everything we want

7165 2018-11-22 14:05:21 Really....
Paid $2.18 yesterday in Kansas - i guess some states have far greater tax than Kansas and want to blame the oil companies or federal policies...
Hmmmmmm...
Be honest....

7166 2018-11-22 14:05:19 These would suit some oil paint washes and rust streaks really well.
7167 2018-11-22 14:05:19 @PeterPsquare nice melody   more oil on ya head baba...
7168 2018-11-22 14:05:09 Olga, all these oligarchs, ceo's are using commodities, markets, oil etc and banks to launder their money. They cant do it in china because they'll  keep it.
7169 2018-11-22 14:05:07 How good the economy is? We are being dragged along by the US. With no new investment in Canada and our loonie in the dumps with our oil, we can be sure when the next recession hits, we will also be dragged along to the bottom.
7170 2018-11-22 14:05:07 The market is plummeting for #oil. There is no business case for the pipeline. #abpoli #bcpoli #cdnpoli
7171 2018-11-22 14:05:07 Wrong wrong wrong, we now frack so much oil we are exporting a lot of it . Before we imported most of it. The oilfield is rocking and rolling like it hasn’t done in a long time!!!
7172 2018-11-22 14:04:58 just ordered beard shampoo, beard conditioner, and beard oil... lets see if I can take my beard game to the next level
7173 2018-11-22 14:04:55 Price of oil is reducing globally. Some countries are happy but Nigeria is crying.
7174 2018-11-22 14:04:50 We get 40% of our oil from Canada. Less than 10% from Saudi Arabia.
7175 2018-11-22 14:04:49 I’d say good bye to Texas in 2020. As an independent oil producer lower oil prices will soon drive all of smaller companies out of business. Probably looking at Dems next time I vote.
7176 2018-11-22 14:04:44 Your Justine Tissue Oil is simply fabulous & something every pregnant women should be using.
7177 2018-11-22 14:04:37 My comprehension of this is a small group of wealthy Liberal supporters in  Mtl would lose millions importing and selling Saudi oil if Trudeau ever supported pipelines or Alberta oil,
7178 2018-11-22 14:04:37 Yes bro,  if the petrol and diesel comes down it was due to Crude oil prices .if it increases then it was @narendramodi increased it ...
7179 2018-11-22 14:04:29 Right?  Maybe the Fred Ryan he is referring to is the pedo priest Frederick Ryan. Easy to confuse the two.
7180 2018-11-22 14:04:27 I thought that you were spawned by an  unholy union between a lib ownership AI and an offshore oil rig.
7181 2018-11-22 14:04:22 We're already paying more than a few cents at the pump. Gas prices have been steadily rising since Trump started squatting in the White House. Ask him why when the US is producing more oil than ever. We are not beholden to the Saudis, trump is!
7182 2018-11-22 14:04:22 The fact is that the US has more oil reserves than any country on earth. There is absolutely no reason that we should have to import any oil. Just change the laws and let the oil companies drill to get it.

7185 2018-11-22 14:04:10 We can put billions more into becoming a green nation & we were well on our way prior to TRump. Young people are far more interested in solar/electric vehicles, We could be completely independent of foreign oil easily. Greedy GOP’ers invested heavily in foreign oil prevent it.
7186 2018-11-22 14:04:04 The allied war in the European Theatre wasn't in anyway a war of imperialism. The war in the Middle East for sure was a land grab by the British to secure oil fields, but not in Europe.

7189 2018-11-22 14:03:59 Saudi Arabia produces 3x the oil of Canada.  Do you not understand how Saudi Oil prices influence world oil prices wether or not they are primary direct exporters to the US?  Either you are being disingenuous or ur kinda stupid. @realDonaldTrump @maga @SebGorka
7190 2018-11-22 14:03:58 I cannot believe that we now actually believe that Donald Trump is the driving factor of the entire world's oil market. Not OPEC that produces 30mbd, or the US shale industry, or the world economic situation, or Middle East tensions? It's "Bizarro world".
7191 2018-11-22 14:03:53 Fishermen are in the way of oil and seems to be that's all that matters turning there backs on the industry that built this province
7192 2018-11-22 14:03:39 I want one. But it won't happen here with big oil choking out electric vehicles.
7193 2018-11-22 14:03:32 Americans have enough oil, natural gas & renewable resources.  What we need is inspired leadership & focus on what makes core American values the tip of the spear. Happy Thanksgiving.
7194 2018-11-22 14:03:31 How about everyone stops buying Saudi Aramco oil and we'll see how long the 'Royal Family' survives selling sand?  Bastards........
7195 2018-11-22 14:03:25 Belated Happy #Canadian #ThanksgivingDay2018, and a cross-border thanks for lower #oil prices!  

Oh, #Canada!

#Thanksgiving2018
7196 2018-11-22 14:03:23 Please, we’ve got more oil just sitting in the ground in Texas.
7197 2018-11-22 14:03:15 Saudi Arabia needs to be held accountable. Regardless of lower oil prices, there is no props to be giving here as a trade off. I doubt any past POTUS would of done anything, but there can be a first. Disheartening to see.
7198 2018-11-22 14:03:13 We Americans, don't need the S&P , nor Trump tooting his own horn, to know that our economy is humming.   Man on the street is feeling it.  And ya gotta admit, granting exemptions for Iran fucked a lot of speculation in oil, hard.  They will be less eager to rally oil again.
7199 2018-11-22 14:03:06 Like oil blood money to buy a reporters life ? We will be riding around on the bones blood and guts provided by MBS on the soul of a didicated man?
7200 2018-11-22 14:03:05 Don't put the frozen turkey in the oil!!!!!!
7201 2018-11-22 14:03:04 How about focus on getting off of Saudi Arabia oil! They can out right murder Americans but that's ok in your book! It's not OK. Just because they are rich and your afraid of them doesn't give them a pass!!
7202 2018-11-22 14:03:04 Everything, even the oil markets are politicized.
7203 2018-11-22 14:03:02 Inspiration is God Giving You Oil to Slip Out of Dangerous Thinking Patterns. #JHM
7204 2018-11-22 14:03:01 So typical of Trump, even though Canada exports 40% oil to the USA while Saudi Arabia only 10%  why doesn't he thanks Canada.
7205 2018-11-22 14:02:56 @realDonaldTrump Canada is the US's biggest supplier of oil at 40%,compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
U said thanks to your "friend" #PrinceMBS after he ordered to kill an innocent journalist So Justintrudeau could kill how many?

7214 2018-11-22 14:01:57 You certainly did (and probably still do) have a financial interest to profit from your puts on $TSLA. Then there legitimately are people in ICE auto industry and it's ecosystem, oil and gas industry, dealerships etc for whom rise of Tesla is an existential threat.
7215 2018-11-22 14:01:53 President Obama( a real President)had Gas under two dollars a gallon. Gas prices rose under you(a fake President) so what is the media to report. That trump has almost got gas to 2.50 a gallon. Wall Street is falling dragging oil prices with it. Thanks to trump. #realnews
7216 2018-11-22 14:01:51 You sold US morals/values for money & 11% of Saudi Oil. Your lack of leadership skills are astounding!
7217 2018-11-22 14:01:43 you just put a price tag on moral leadership. on thanksgiving. I can't wait until you're gone. (and you're wrong about the jobs and oil)

7220 2018-11-22 14:01:35 The top three producers of oil are Saudi Arabia, Russia, and USA. We are just gluttons that have to import
7221 2018-11-22 14:01:31 And the reporter was murdered for reporting it. And tump is no better than the Saudis for turning the other way. Only cares about oil prices.
7222 2018-11-22 14:01:30 US special interest groups guised as “environmental” organizations fund propaganda to prevent pipeline development in Canada, preventing Cdn oil from reaching the east or west coasts and fetching fair market value. Instead, it’s sold to the US at less than 1/3 of the global $

7227 2018-11-22 14:01:11 He is big on achieving American oil self-sufficiency..
7228 2018-11-22 14:01:07 There are many trillions of barrels of oil remaining in world. They're not reserves until they can be economically mined. Avg Permian recovery factor has been ~10%, and it has produced 25bb over 90 yrs. That would mean there are stil at least 250bb oil still down there.
7229 2018-11-22 14:00:50 If by "WE" you are referring to Sask motorists your wrong we aren't paying 60$ for Saudi oil we are paying 15 for Prairy oil so why do we pay more for gas than Ontaio motorists.
7230 2018-11-22 14:00:47 ugh. the wonders of efficascent oil roll-on. if you guys have toothache, just rub efficascent oil sa part ng cheeks where it hurts, then bury your face sa pillow para may pressure haha and let the burning sensation of the oil fight the pain away. super effective. ehe
7231 2018-11-22 14:00:46 He didn't put the oil there, but he has opened the spigot through deregulation, speeding review of projects, opening Federal lands to fracking and drilling (Anwar), transportation (Keystone) and getting us out of the stupid Paris Climate Debacle.
7232 2018-11-22 14:00:35 Oil hasn't been $82 a barrel since 2014. Trump was full of shit

But if you think murdering one person is fine if it results in cheap oil then maybe you should ask yourself how much value your own life has. How cheap of oil would be worth your own life? No one deserves that.
7233 2018-11-22 14:00:34 The Globalist are truly afraid of TRUMP.All we hear is Arabia!!! while they are causing GENOCIDE to steal oil and gas in Hebrew Biafra and Southern Cameroon.
7234 2018-11-22 14:00:33 Crude oil price actually started crashing in August 2014. By November 2014, things were falling apart. FG was borrowing to pay salaries and local contractors were completely abandoned

7237 2018-11-22 14:00:25 Last I checked sport, us  supply more oil to the US than Saudi Arabia.  LIAR.
7238 2018-11-22 14:00:23 Stop lying. You have nothing to do with the price of oil. It is supply and demand plain and simple. At too low prices the budgets in  OPEC countries are not sustainable. Then will then cut back production and the prices will increase. They do not believe in America first.
7239 2018-11-22 14:00:23 It takes about 10 minutes per pound. No oil to heat up/dispose of after you are done. Same amazing juicy taste. Highly recommended.
7240 2018-11-22 14:00:17 They didn’t “lower gas prices.” The price of oil per barrel fell - in part - because of growing fears over an economic slowdown and the impact those concerns are having on the broader stock market. 
Trump’s inability to correctly frame anything is worrisome.

7248 2018-11-22 13:59:36 need a different leader in AB to have the balls to bring AB manufacturing back. Courage to pull out of any carbon tax, stop oil trading with western Canada & Eastern Canada and stop LNG to the west while threatening separation.

7259 2018-11-22 13:58:23 Really? The oil responsible for this price point is from Canada.
7260 2018-11-22 13:58:21 Oil is a global commodity. Canadians, no matter where they live, will pay the full global cost, plus various local taxes and local costs. As for exports, there's a global oil glut and no matter what the Canadian price is, the US and Saudi Arabia can undercut it.
7261 2018-11-22 13:58:19 Trump interacts with an ally on oil.

7265 2018-11-22 13:58:08 Numbers are skewed because we buy Canada’s crude oil to turn refine and sell it back to them. We make quite a bit of money off it. Public knowledge.
7266 2018-11-22 13:58:08 One day, Harry Potter started to apply for work in the oil and gas industry. After a couple of months, he finally got a job at Patronus :p Welcome back to Twitter world! :)
7267 2018-11-22 13:58:06 With crude oil prices tumbling to $62, nearly 25% off recent highs of $85, fuel prices in India should fall more than they have so far. PSU oil companies seeking a profit cushion mustn’t shortchange consumers
7268 2018-11-22 13:58:05 Scotty, you and your friends are not going to save climate change. The climate is changing but not due to humans, and humans won't stop it. Get over it dude, just a simple fact. The entire earth was once frozen, long before oil companies and combustion engines.
7269 2018-11-22 13:57:58 Pakein baby oil atau ga minyak zaitun
7270 2018-11-22 13:57:50 The fact is the higher the prices the more viable Shale oil industry is, in the US. So low prices will put them out of business. I also expect prices to eventually be above 80 for that reason.
7271 2018-11-22 13:57:35 aye but to get energy from coal you HAVE to burn it, to make use of palm oil you don't have to deforest all over the place, there are other options
7272 2018-11-22 13:57:32 @atikucmw @atiku @bukolasaraki in May 29th 1999 the price per barrel of oil was not $30 yet the country was better managed
7273 2018-11-22 13:57:29 And yeah, yeah, operational security, I know.  We went over there to save the Kuwaiti's asses (and money, and oil), and then leave the Iraqi insurgents we told we'd back up to twist in the wind.  It's possible that I'm slightly bitter about Bush1 and the event as a whole. 
7274 2018-11-22 13:57:21 So all of this is nothing to do with the price of crude oil....?
7275 2018-11-22 13:57:17 I was watching NBC news last night. The US gets just 9% of its oil from Saudi. The largest non US supplier is Canada at 40%.
7276 2018-11-22 13:57:17 Whether it happens now or 100 years, EVs and alternatives will happen.  Oil is not forever.  It was given to us to use to figure out how to better use non-oil based energies.  It's kind of like elementary school before high school.  College is zero-point atomic/ethereal.
7277 2018-11-22 13:57:11 Econ/cultural Migration 5. I've heard many a year ago in I had oil money do you think i fall asleep.
7278 2018-11-22 13:57:10 However I would like to assure you that our prices closely track the crude oil price, we pass on reductions as quickly as we can, and try our best to shield our customers from dramatic price increase. 2/3

7286 2018-11-22 13:56:30 Solid 2 way deal: refineries in China with Saudi investment and committed oil supply and refineries in Saudi Arabia with Chinese capital and commitments for products buys. Add PETROCHEMS to all that. Saudi has similar deals in SE Asia but not nearly as large as those with China.
7287 2018-11-22 13:56:25 Those "billions of dollars" are for weapons you're selling to Saudi Arabia to murder children & families in Yemen. Where are those "big jobs?" except for soldiers wounded in wars because Saudi hijackers murdered Americans on 911. & OIL? This isn't 1978.

7294 2018-11-22 13:55:55 Says a mean & nasty man. A man who values money more than a human life. A man who constantly lies about the amount the Saudis are spending ($14.5B vs $450B) & number of potential jobs. Who overstates oil purchases from them (40% imported from Canada, only 9% from Saudi Arabia).
7295 2018-11-22 13:55:53 The US produces the most oil in the world right now so I don’t understand what you’re trying to say. I think you’re covering up for the terrible mistakes in Yemen.

7300 2018-11-22 13:55:31 Ask a climate scientist, one who is not on the oil industry payroll, or an elementary school teacher.
7301 2018-11-22 13:55:31 12% of our oil is from Saudi Arabia and Persian Gulf.  Gimme s break.

7303 2018-11-22 13:55:25 To clarify, it is 11% of our imported oil. We are very close to energy independent.
7304 2018-11-22 13:55:19 For a businessman, a smart businessman he should know Saudi Arabia doesn't set of oil prices plus we produce more oil than Saudi Arabia does now.

7322 2018-11-22 13:54:07 The USA buys most of its oil from Canada, not from Saudi Arabia. And it gets it at a great discount. So much in fact that the average American already pays much less than Canadians for gas at the pump. With oil prices down we lose jobs.
7323 2018-11-22 13:54:06 Experts predicting that oil prices will hit $100 to $150 a barrel in 2019-2020 as oil prices are being brought down to hurt Iran but will affect the world's oil supply in the long run and cause an oil crunch.
7324 2018-11-22 13:53:59 You had nothing to do with the reduced gas prices. It's the oil glut on the market stupid. So now Opec will reduce their output and prices will rise
7325 2018-11-22 13:53:58 To be fair, Saudi Arabia really has nothing to do with this drop in prices. They're reducing production to push prices up. And we only get 9% of our oil from them. Most of our oil imports (40%) are from Canada.
7326 2018-11-22 13:53:56 .
THAT IS BULLSHIT

We produce MORE oil DOMESTICALLY than Saudi Arabia
(we import around 14% from them)
The oil WE MOSTLY IMPORT is from Canada & it’s about 35-40%

tRUMP ENRICHES HIMSELF and claims ITS FOR AMERICA

So I say BULLSHIT ..

7349 2018-11-22 13:52:10 Previous administrations decisions to make puppet leaders in Afganistan & Iraq may have part to do with the continued drop in oil? 
Don't worry trump will fxck that up with a teriff or something?
  But a murdered Journalist is well worth the price for Dim Wit Don, to brag about!

7352 2018-11-22 13:52:07 I suppose being an Oil & Gas analyst doesnt read very well across to Tech companies. Then again, his analysis doesnt read very well across to O&G either so...
7353 2018-11-22 13:52:01 Sorry twinkle toes. Canada does not supply 4 times as much gasoline . The refineries are in the US. Canada sends heavy crude. US oil production is what is up. Do they still make twinkies?
#DumbAsAStickOfWood
7354 2018-11-22 13:51:57 These are the cruel and illegal acts of a country our so-called leader just thanked - because of cheap oil? Has the US stooped so low that it now rejects human rights with blood money. Not everyone agrees. Neither shud we. Wud anyone tolerate such cruelty if it were ur daughter?
7355 2018-11-22 13:51:55 $54 oil is not a good sign. I’d suggest that we’re on the cusp of another recession.
7356 2018-11-22 13:51:51 I like pouring that oil in me early 
7357 2018-11-22 13:51:48 Hi @amazonwatch. Could you share a link for more info on the deliberate dumping of oil that you mentioned in your tweet? Thank you.
7358 2018-11-22 13:51:44 Saudis threw you under by saying they have not done anything with oil prices because you forgave their murderous ways.  #cheetoinchief
7359 2018-11-22 13:51:40 No one would be thanking the Saudi’s for cheap oil (which it is still not and only 11% from SA) just after intelligence that the crown prince ordered that hit.  No matter his citizenship no decent human would make a statement like that. You’re twisted and morally corrupt.
7360 2018-11-22 13:51:34 Had to go into @TomsCakes so I could take a nice picture of the cakes for work Instagram. Such a struggle having to buy a rosemary and lemon olive oil cake while there.
7361 2018-11-22 13:51:32 You can try applying some olive oil  to your lashes
7362 2018-11-22 13:51:27 The challenges in Alberta are with them forever until they grasp oil sands is a losing proposition.

7366 2018-11-22 13:51:09 I still can't believe I'm in a world where the president thanks Saudi Arabia for cheap oil.  Who openly murdered a journalist for his opinion....   Mind blowing stuff.....  Humanity is in serious trouble.
7367 2018-11-22 13:51:08 OIL JUST SPOKE TO ME AND SAID: WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO KHASHOGGI, THERE'S A RECESSION COMING.
7368 2018-11-22 13:51:05 They need us a hell of a lot more than we need them. In fact, since we're the world's largest oil producer and get 40% of ours imported from Canada we don't need those cut throats at all.
7369 2018-11-22 13:51:04 This is not about 100 dollar a barrel oil.  A pipeline will help lower the current gap between world oil prices and alberta oil.  Educate yourself.

7371 2018-11-22 13:51:02 40% of US oil supply comes from Canada.
7372 2018-11-22 13:51:00 Is the buffoon really taking credit for low oil prices?
7373 2018-11-22 13:50:58 I find it weird that anyone who doesn’t latch onto the tit of oil could have any support for or trust in big oil Corp. When was the last time the price at the pumps reflected the price of oil.......?
7374 2018-11-22 13:50:51 Can I come and taste? I'm close
7375 2018-11-22 13:50:48 Yeah you see..
All you have to do is kill an american journalist, lower some oil prices and you be best friends with trump forever..

7378 2018-11-22 13:50:35 Yeh just condone a murder of a journalist by Saudi Prince and suddenly they lower oil prices. Good job Donald !
7379 2018-11-22 13:50:34 You all have been allowing this to go on for years. How about stop our dependence on oil? How about protecting our press from brutal murder? Complicit!
7380 2018-11-22 13:50:27 Too many Labor ministers end up working for oil and gas companies for my liking.

7387 2018-11-22 13:49:48 Yet the Saudis are members of OPEC which has significant control on international oil prices, and Canada is not. 

Also, if 11%of your groceries are cheaper, you save money right?
7388 2018-11-22 13:49:47 Conflating oil rigs with nuclear is a physics 101 level fail. Hard data beats fear any day. And do you seriously believe that RE can be produced without commodities?
7389 2018-11-22 13:49:40 Crude oil prices went up by 4% yesterday.

7391 2018-11-22 13:49:39 If #Trump knew anything about gas prices he would know that Saudi Arabia only contributes about 11% to the total oil used in the United States. 

The bulk of the oil used in the United States comes from the United States.

#TrumpsAnIdiot
7392 2018-11-22 13:49:36 THE PRICE OF OIL DOES NOT DEPEND ON SAUDI ARABIA. Now tell us about how well the soybean farmers are doing.

7396 2018-11-22 13:49:01 Eek... glad the oil helped. Maybe I should try that. And thank you 
7397 2018-11-22 13:48:58 Why the Philippines needs to realise that they have oil resources and China is the first to explore it because they already discovered it, 

they want to hurry the explorations in their own country before it's too late
Why they don't realized it from the first place! #xijinpingph

7400 2018-11-22 13:48:52 Sorry but you need to use your brain, the war in Yemen is not about Saudi-led coalition. In fact without Saudi Arabia and UAE Yemen humanitarian crisis would triple as they provide most aids from salaries to oil and electricity.
7401 2018-11-22 13:48:52 Saudi Arabia supplies only 10% of US oil, Canada supplies 40%, and could increase that to 50% easily. US doesn’t need Saudis for oil! 
7402 2018-11-22 13:48:48 If China didn’t care they wouldn’t have removed oil rig in HYSY981 in 2014 in the face of Vietnamese riots.

7407 2018-11-22 13:48:32 The oil prices never had anything to do with Obama nor Trump
7408 2018-11-22 13:48:28 Clearly she doesnt. Canadian oil gets sold so cheap because it basically all goes to the states and they control the price. Pipelines to tidewater opens up the world market, thus a better price!
7409 2018-11-22 13:48:19 I don’t know why Trump claims he’s brought down Saudi oil prices. They rose steeply after Trump took office. They have recently fallen, but they’re still higher than when he took office.

He just makes stuff up. His base lap it up.
7410 2018-11-22 13:48:13 1stly, aku ilangin semua pake baby oil trus di pencet. lalu aku jaga makan, not to oily yang jelas.
7411 2018-11-22 13:48:12 I don’t know, but we can start with appealing to a sense of patriotism, duty, proving that “green jobs” can actually work and take the place of the hundreds of thousands of oil jobs, that the USA can be an economic power because of green tech. One more in thread
7412 2018-11-22 13:48:10 Of course you agree. Pretty sure you forced him to say it. And now it’s “many” billions? What happened to “hundreds of billions. We need to lessen dependence on oil. #YoureTheWorst
7413 2018-11-22 13:47:58 #OIL #OOTT #WTI 
Due to the #Thanksgivung Holiday, #CME will halt WTI trading at 1:00 PM EST today. While the liquidity is lower than normal, it does not mean the volatility shall decrease.
7414 2018-11-22 13:47:58 Wow what snake oil. I feel sorry for all the people who thought these guys were legit:
7415 2018-11-22 13:47:57 And if it was white Sean Hannity who was chopped up and dissolved in oil?
7416 2018-11-22 13:47:55 Enough with the hero-worship. You make it sound like Trump put the oil there. You are riding a wave of production growth that started in 2010 or so - his achievement is to keep it on track by rolling back some regulations.
7417 2018-11-22 13:47:55 Why did we let the murder happen in the first place? It is clear that officials in more than one country knew it was going to happen, US included. Oil and money.
7418 2018-11-22 13:47:51 Whenever Crude oil WTI drop, our oil price drop. It does influence the other world.
7419 2018-11-22 13:47:51 So letting a country get away with murder is your solution to a “mean and nasty world”?  We now know the price of a little over a gallon of human blood and clearly it is lower than a barrel of oil. God must be so proud.  
7420 2018-11-22 13:47:43 Same genius who ignored IC reports about MBS assassinating naturalized American journalist so that he could keep making $ from Saudis, while lying about jobs and oil. #MAGA nothing more than another Don con.
7421 2018-11-22 13:47:41 Really because what I have heard is that the instability you have caused and the fears of a downturn are what is causing oil to go down.
7422 2018-11-22 13:47:32 Time Magazine "Person of the year" belongs to #Khashoggi! Not Trump! Khashoggi's brutal murder was used to give us lower oil prices. Our own president made a deal, and signed it in blood. Let that sink in for a minute! Trump is a traitor! Evil!

7425 2018-11-22 13:47:25 To be clear, Saudi Arabia provides something like 11% of our oil imports.  Canada provides 3-4x that, so they have a much higher influence on price.  Plus, SA has indicated that they will be slowing production, which will raise prices.  Why the praise for them?
7426 2018-11-22 13:47:22 Are you that stupid? The truth is that no president -- whether Democrat or Republican can do much of anything to affect the short-term price of oil/gasoline. The overriding factor that determines the price of oil from day to day is the market principle of supply and demand
7427 2018-11-22 13:47:18 Many years ago, my Dalmatian ate 14 glass Christmas tree ornaments.  We gave him some oil recommended by vet and he passed them over next few days.  We had sparkly poopers in the yard---very festive.  Hope Ryan has no problems with the chicken bone.

Because you seem confused.

7431 2018-11-22 13:47:07 Clarification: We buy four times more oil from Canada than we do from Saudi Arabia, meatbag. And yet you’ll take potshots at Trudeau if he so much as thinks about speaking critically of you. The Saudi crown prince had a journalist murdered, and you do not care because “oil.”
7432 2018-11-22 13:47:03 For MbS to survive, he needs to keep increasing the handouts for KSA's increasing population, which requires higher oil prices.
7433 2018-11-22 13:47:00 @realdonaldtrump - Don't try to use oil as excuse for not punishing Prince of Saudi Arabia. 40% of USA oil comes from Canada with only 11% coming from Saudi Arabia -  don't thank Saudi Arabia - thank Justin Trudeau and Canada for lower  oil prices #DonaldTrumpIdiot
7434 2018-11-22 13:46:53 IMO what hurts is Politicians that Voted for Iraq War like Schiff,Engel,Lowey,Hoyer,etc. had access to all childish ,absurd fake evidence, they knew Iraq was only about Oil & huge Contracts while Bin Laden laughing in Afghanistan & they still send the US Soldiers to die in Iraq

7437 2018-11-22 13:46:45 Actually America first is right unless you want to pay $5 a gallon for gas. Let Saudi Arabia cut oil production and see what happens.
7438 2018-11-22 13:46:40 Just an FYI from someone with a relative in the Canadian oil business, we buy almost 100% of their crude oil from the west side of Canada, refine it into gasoline, and sell it back to the east side of Canada. Very public knowledge. We make a KILLING off it. Gas was $4 under Obama
7439 2018-11-22 13:46:37 Shouldn’t but will. We’re in their pockets cos of oil
7440 2018-11-22 13:46:37 And loss of jobs in Trump Oil states.
We know the man loves his jobs numbers.
7441 2018-11-22 13:46:34 Well Mr. Axelrod, he would ask you if you really want the price of oil to go up, or billions of dollars of investment to be squandered over one journalist's murder.
7442 2018-11-22 13:46:33 .. call ally. I’ve never been more disappointed, upset & angry at this president & administration than I am right now! Money doesn’t compare to a person’s life. @realDonaldTrump @SecPompeo can take SA money and oil & shove it! #JusticeForKhashoggi #AmericanValues
7443 2018-11-22 13:46:32 You want to claim emissions from the tar sands are small compared to global emissions, then ask what I use to heat my home?  The oil industry is the problem, everything running on oil is the problem, let's find solutions.
7444 2018-11-22 13:46:10 If you own an iPhone or any Apple product, all made in China, you're a hypocrite if you are calling Trump out over Khashoggi and Saudi oil.

7454 2018-11-22 13:44:55 We get only 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. We don’t need to be nice to them. But you have huge financial ties to the country so you humiliate the US on the world stage. You are beyond pathetic.
7455 2018-11-22 13:44:53 Big Oil.

7466 2018-11-22 13:44:26 CIA recording of MBS "Silence Jamal #Khashoggi asap." Trump smears him while #SaudiArabia forbids criticism of royals; Trump praises Saudis for cheap oil and partnership with US. Yes, a racist Islamophobe is in cahoots with the 'custodians' of Islam's holiest sites.

7468 2018-11-22 13:44:19 Even IF your crazy, unsubstantiated conspiracy theories explain away SA culpability in 9/11 and Kashoggi murder, their history of human rights abuses is enough to condemn them. Seems that most MAGA dgaf about that though, b/c Dear Leader says weapon sales & oil prices matter more

7474 2018-11-22 13:43:36 Look like fake news. And why oil industry would stop investing??
7475 2018-11-22 13:43:36 Lol we did not. I only DMed my points about oil nothing about SARB. I wasn't even done talking. I stay far from the JSE40 because of those gap ups and downs. I love holding long position s so those gaps aren't good for me. I'll stick to Dow Jones 30 and commodities.
7476 2018-11-22 13:43:36 You can say whatever but it’s horrible to own shares in USA today ! Everything falls and they just get cheaper and cheaper. Like the oil  Eat a turkey and relax

7478 2018-11-22 13:43:31 And Trump just made the world a much more dangerous place. He just gave the Saudi's a free murder of a journalist in return for lower oil prices. That is evil. I wish I could boycott oil right now! Burning pissed off!!!
7479 2018-11-22 13:43:29 Simple Diane, we solve this price differential issue caused by a lack of demand and worldwide supply glut by building dozens of new pipelines and flooding the market with more oil. As everyone knows the price goes up when there’s more supply without corresponding increase demand
7480 2018-11-22 13:43:26 Now Jeff...... the plan was perfect the fact that I'm 2 gallons short of peanut oil  was just an oversight
7481 2018-11-22 13:43:23 Quite literally! But what is alarming (at least for the moment) - is too many "leaders" simply are ineffective at setting that TRUTHFUL & ACCURATE NARRATIVE against this Would-be-Tyrant Trump. He is the "Blood for Oil President"...or "Blood for Money President"...

7490 2018-11-22 13:42:42 This may be a propaganda piece paid for by the American fracking industry to stop Canadian/Alberta oil from reaching tide waters. Possible? Yes
7491 2018-11-22 13:42:37 Currently the rand is responding well on those news and oil prices have been on the fall that give an expectation of decrease in price of petrol which leads to lower prices and inflation kept in check. Leaving consumers with the means to deal with their debt obligations.
7492 2018-11-22 13:42:31 Shouldn’t you thank Canada since we get most our oil from them ?
7493 2018-11-22 13:42:29 Suddenly, US becomes crude oil price controller instead of OPEC+ for the first time ever.

Poor you OPEC+ countries.


7494 2018-11-22 13:42:22 MSNBC just said we get 9% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. But I'll still give you 11%.  So please don't BS about how they reduced the price of oil for us. They recently said they are going to cut back production.
7495 2018-11-22 13:42:22 Oh, honey. I think that ship sailed (and then ran aground causing a massive oil spill) ages ago.

7500 2018-11-22 13:42:00 #Oil’s 25 per cent collapse from its high of $86 a barrel in early October to below $65 has put the so-called “lower for longer” thesis firmly back into the spotlight, having been assigned to the scrap heap only 3 months ago @FT #energy

7503 2018-11-22 13:41:53 @mulla_luris thanks dear for your support to your country at the Oil&power South Sudan ,you are such strong young lady South Sudanese  I have ever seen am inspiredby you and wish one day to see you holding a ministerial post in this country.looking forward to meet you .
7504 2018-11-22 13:41:46 We allow him to perpetuate falsehoods on TOP of the moral compromise. They need to sell oil FAR more than we need their oil. They need our aircraft and equipment FAR more than we need their dirty money. @McFaul
7505 2018-11-22 13:41:43 All in the name of lower oil prices?!!! God only knows what this orange man would let happen to cash a fat check under the table as well! Pure evil. Next time I put gas in my car, I will pretend it is #KashoggiMurder blood! Shameful Rump! Shameful!
7506 2018-11-22 13:41:43 Sometimes, I wish God didn't bless this country with Crude oil as part of our natural resources. Maybe we would've had sense and relied on other resources
7507 2018-11-22 13:41:41 Sir tanggalin po natin brief baka malagyan ng oil
7508 2018-11-22 13:41:38 Yeah so these are all weighted average indices. Oil prices go in as well, as do automotives/air tickets. They ensure that PPP adjustments for overall GDP are 2x-4x instead of 10x as would be the case if you were looking at food, rent, local labour.

7511 2018-11-22 13:41:13 How do you trumpet Trump. thank Saudi Arabia for the low oil prices and do not condemn it for what it did with Khashoggi
7512 2018-11-22 13:41:01 We can’t even keep oil rigs from exploding, we can’t dot the world with thousands of heap reactors and pray they’re as ‘foolproof’ as claimed.

And why waste our planets precious fissile material, just so commmodities traders can make buckets of money making the world less safe?
7513 2018-11-22 13:40:59 As this being the best selling cookie in the UK - 

Can you tell me where you source your palm oil ingredient please and if you will have “sustainable and ethically” sourced palm oil on your packaging anytime in the near future please?
7514 2018-11-22 13:40:57 If only this was his only tweet today, instead he began the morning by downplaying the murder and dismemberment of a US resident and journalist, giving the green light to dictators around the world to murder our journalists so long as they pay us enough and give us oil.
7515 2018-11-22 13:40:55 Hey did you hear we bought an oil pipeline

わいも足くじかないように気を付けないと……ｗｗ
7517 2018-11-22 13:40:49 That sounds strangly like a premeditated plan where you traded Jamal Khashoggi's life in exchange for lower prices on oil from Saudi Arabia.
7518 2018-11-22 13:40:48 My brother got me an oil cartridge for my birthday. I mean  I just ran out too 
7519 2018-11-22 13:40:44 Are you confusing ISIS with Iran? 

Speaking of Iran, DJTwatwaffle has loosened the sanctions against Iran allowing them to sell a lot of their oil. So Iran too has become stronger. 

Another abandoned - reversed even - campaign promise. Thanks for reminding me.

7526 2018-11-22 13:40:16 Obama stated that the era of cheap oil was over forever
7527 2018-11-22 13:40:12 Mr President, You are the most educated person  on this planet and believe me you know it all. You also know that during Obama regime when Fracking technique was booming in 2014/2015 crude oil price was $26/barrel.  Believe me you know it all.
7528 2018-11-22 13:40:11 Blood, oil, weapons, money, lies ...
In sum: the trump doctrine.
7529 2018-11-22 13:40:10 油揚げって言うほど油って感じしなくない？ほんとに騙された気分だよ。
7530 2018-11-22 13:40:00 You do know, But then again I might be giving you too much credit, the United States produces oil as well look it up you might learn something.
7531 2018-11-22 13:39:59 Bat amoy empi yung shark oil 
7532 2018-11-22 13:39:58 If you were a real President you would tell Saudi Arabia to shove their oil up their thobes.
7533 2018-11-22 13:39:52 You have done nothing, it is obvious you know nothing about oil pricing.
7534 2018-11-22 13:39:45 You sold the soul of this nation to an evil empire. You used the blood of a journalist as a negotiation tool to lower oil prices. That is a definition of evil. The Saudis should be facing very stiff sanctions for this! What you did was evil, disgusting, and outright unethical!
7535 2018-11-22 13:39:44 Blood for oil. Literally.
7536 2018-11-22 13:39:43 Richard Leonard should be commended for consistently making the case for independence , for it is only with an oil fund & control over Scotland’s resources that we can afford what he proposes #FMQs
7537 2018-11-22 13:39:39 Nothing like getting up at the ass crack of dawn to shove your hand up a freezing cold raw turkey and massage it with oil and butter, right . Only part I hate about thanksgiving, but I am still so thankful for it .
7538 2018-11-22 13:39:34 So you are getting it now. The auto industry in US lobbied our government to take it easy on them on fuel standards while addicted to oil. While Germans outright cheated. If it was not for Tesla the entrenched industry would have buried EVs to continue their profitable ways.
7539 2018-11-22 13:39:33 1. Wash your face LESS than 10s! 
- Any cleanser is fine (altho milder ones like Cetaphil - which I use - are preferable cuz they're not harsh)
- Why <10s?? Cuz you dun want to strip off ALL oil on your face! Leaving a lil bit on is important cuz it's part of skin natural barrier
7540 2018-11-22 13:39:26 Saudi has a heavier seat in OPEC,  when the oil prices are lowered world wide, it effects Canada's price as well.

It's geopolitics, economics and diplomacy, try to keep up.
7541 2018-11-22 13:39:18 The less fortunate as in the reporter who was viciously murdered and had his body chopped up into unidentifiable pieces?

And we should be grateful for a President who looks the other way and sends his gratitude to those responsible because oil prices are lowered?

NO!

7543 2018-11-22 13:39:16 @rogerwaters You give me hope for humanity. Thank you for standing proud in the face of so much wrong. #Assange #Chevron Could you ask Ecuador President to save the #Amazon from #China logging and oil drilling?
7544 2018-11-22 13:39:14 Home heating oil... that’s an issue... who can afford the extra $600-$800 per month to keep the pipes thawed.  If you’re helping the Saudi Prince this stuff should be dirt cheap.
7545 2018-11-22 13:39:05 According to recent stats by Arif Habib grp, the electricity generation by Furnace Oil has dropped to a mere 8%. RLNG and imported coal has gone wayy up to a combined of around 40%. Which is why low oil prices r not gonna impact much !
7546 2018-11-22 13:39:03 air tickets. Oil prices (petrol). Medical care. just too many things IMHO

rent/food are only places where some kind of correction makes sense
7547 2018-11-22 13:39:02 Would that be the same Norway with the sovereign wealth fund from its oil not taken by its neighbour, the one with a huge ship building industry not destroyed by its neighbour, or the one that somehow was a bad idea for an indy Scotland model as told by its neighbour?
7548 2018-11-22 13:39:00 It won't be long this British Oil company #Nigeria will exist no more.
7549 2018-11-22 13:38:54 I almost feel like we should halt oil exports for a couple days to teach Americans and their corrupt president where their oil really comes from. 
#SaudiArabia
7550 2018-11-22 13:38:49 What is America’s Values worth to you Mr President?  How much do the Saudis enrich you and your family. Saudi rely on US for equipment and spare parts. We only get 11% of our oil from them. The US is the worlds largest producer of oil. This puts there interests above ours idiot
7551 2018-11-22 13:38:29 Huh? He literally says that it doesn't matter if SA ordered the killing, and their other problems don't matter either, cause they make lots of oil and buy lots of weapons. I get that compromising principles for cash is the ultimate capitalist strategy, but I won't accept it.
7552 2018-11-22 13:38:29 Not that many jobs & we get only 9% of our oil from the Saudis. You made it America is for sale time.
7553 2018-11-22 13:38:22 Genuinely interested in your packaging @BurtonsBiscuits for Maryland Biscuits as to why you don’t have any ethically sourced palm oil or sustainable palm oil logos on your packaging? Will email customer.services@burtonbiscuits.com too.....

He must really want to go to face the angry mob in Calgary

We're selling oil at $13.00 a barrel due to his blocking pipeline construction
He's underestimated the anger
7556 2018-11-22 13:37:51 I am so over the "use coconut oil for everything and put it in everything"!!!! Yea. Sure. That's all fine and dandy for all the people in world that's not allergic to everything coconut! I'm missing out on amazing products all because my body decided that it doesn't like coconut.

7558 2018-11-22 13:37:44 What's your opinion on essential oil?
7559 2018-11-22 13:37:41 Nalcor Oil and Gas lead Jim Keating up this morning at Muskrat Falls inquiry talking natural gas and gas-to-wire being ruled out as possible option for domestic power in NL in 2010-2012 period. Now talking gas availability...North Amethyst amendment...
7560 2018-11-22 13:37:28 It's a mean and nasty government that tries to help cover up the murder and dismemberment of one of their permanent residents and journalists in exchange for friendship with the ruler who order the killing and a deal on oil
7561 2018-11-22 13:37:28 There is no known oil in Cuba, but Baraq overlooked the mass killings and torture by the Castro Bros.
7562 2018-11-22 13:37:17 Despite the price action in oil in recent days, the SARB MPC was right to tighten - it underscores the seriousness with which they will pursue the inflation target.  

Also relieved CBN MPC kept rates on hold. Correct decision for Nigeria’s economy.
7563 2018-11-22 13:37:05 The problem is the petroleum industry gets lots of subsidies & tax breaks in the name of keeping fuel prices low. So it's a backdoor tax on oil that we're already paying.
7564 2018-11-22 13:37:03 Thank you to Saudi Arabia, really? Did you mean for producing too much oil or dismembering an American citizen

7570 2018-11-22 13:36:04 I find his venal "Of course it's just about oil and $$$ and power!" approach a breath of fresh air.

I don't miss the the blatant sanctimony of his predecessors.
7571 2018-11-22 13:36:01 You import 40% of your oil from one of your biggest security threats (your words), CANADA. You should stop immediately.
7572 2018-11-22 13:36:01 During your campaign you said we should takeover Iraq’s oil fields . Whatever happened with that?
7573 2018-11-22 13:35:57 Uy sana oil nakakakota ng halaga 
7574 2018-11-22 13:35:48 and Saudi oil is only 11 percent of US import oil---but even if it was 100 percent, just not worth it
7575 2018-11-22 13:35:42 Koch brothers, oil industry.
7576 2018-11-22 13:35:38 If Joe understood economics or wasn’t lying he would say that oil prices increase due to a strong economy.  He would also acknowledge Trumps leadership in pushing oil lower.
7577 2018-11-22 13:35:34 Bahamians can be creative by taking something ordinary like an hibiscus flower and creating a fragrance or an oil from that same flower. This is what it means to be extraordinary #ubthecreators

Can't avoid it in toothpaste. When my Lush shampoo runs out I'll use Friendly shampoo. Think beer's fine.

7585 2018-11-22 13:34:48 The US gets much more oil from Canada.  The US does not need Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia needs the US.  This about the debt you personally owe The Prince.  He bailed you out of debt twice.  You are excusing murder for money.  You are an extremely disgusting person.
7586 2018-11-22 13:34:47 When I think of Saudi Arabia I think of 3000 dead Americans in New York....not cheap oil
7587 2018-11-22 13:34:44 We import more Canadian oil than Saudi Arabian, but go ahead and shovel the shit to cover the sanctioned murder of a journalist.

7589 2018-11-22 13:34:41 You’re fake moral out rage is dishonest.  we can apply that same standard with many countries including China and Russia, etc. Trump is using the Saudi Arabia situation as leverage to help keep oil prices low (costing S.A. billions ) & as a counterbalance to Iran & Russia.
7590 2018-11-22 13:34:36 This is ignorant. Doesn't matter the source. Oil is a global commodity and Saudi Arabia is a swing producer. Trump is an idiot, but you don't have to be one too.

7597 2018-11-22 13:34:14 Until you put tariffs on imported oil like you’ve done to everything, which by the way are starting to cost Americans more to buy. The Great American Loser!
7598 2018-11-22 13:34:11 We run 10w30 in our fleet. Diesel grade with turbo rating. That covers everything we have with one oil even liquid cooled gassers. Save some small air cooled gas equipment that we use SAE 30 in for better cooling.
7599 2018-11-22 13:34:09 The Kinder Morgan pipeline has been transporting western Canadian oil to market since 1953. It would seem to be a well built asset to the country to me.
7600 2018-11-22 13:33:55 Electricity alcohol.  It will not be entirely but again, oil was subsidized.  Electricity can be too.  Taxis in Hong Kong run on natural gas.  Biomass.  It is only a lack of will.  It is just a matter of building infrastructure.  It will start in the cities and move out.
7601 2018-11-22 13:33:54 I would ask what specifically have you done to lower oil prices? Besides suckle on the Saudi teet? That’s all for YOU and NOT for OUR great nation.  What will you say when prices go back up and the economy heads back into recession? Will likely blame anyone and everyone else

7609 2018-11-22 13:33:22 The MPC continues to assess the risks to the longer-term inflation outlook to be on the upside. These risks include tighter global financial conditions, a weaker exchange rate, higher wage growth, international oil prices and rising electricity and water tariffs.

ICYMI,  no one in US is thankful that you prostituted our country to Saudis, ignoring the murder of American journalist, to enrich yourself. We don’t believe your lies about jobs or oil.
7611 2018-11-22 13:33:11 IBS CURE = CBD OIL.
7612 2018-11-22 13:33:05 Most of our imported oil comes from Canada, yet Trump has no trouble insulting that country. Why is he afraid of the Saudis?
7613 2018-11-22 13:33:04 Let me help you out here. You have no say in the price of oil. You get the lion share of your oil needs from the great country of Canada

7626 2018-11-22 13:32:11 I'm with you.. after all most of our oil comes from Canada..Thanks North America!
7627 2018-11-22 13:32:07 This of course is a LIE.  Glut on oil market keeping prices down and the majority of our oil comes from Canada.  Of course Canada is a democracy and you prefer to associate with murderous dictators.

7631 2018-11-22 13:31:39 As greedy as Trump is, his position on the Khashoggi murder is even more petty and disgusting than just oil $$.

1)JK criticized Trump’s position on Iran in his writing.
2) He wrote for WaPo. 

DT hates critical media and Bezos even more than he loves him some Saudi money.
7632 2018-11-22 13:31:39 The banter between the Saudi’s & President Trump to get oil lower may be fuel for the pump.

7645 2018-11-22 13:30:20 So you lied about making America energy independent in the name of national security. You said you would unleash the power of our natural resources like never before and we wouldn’t be dependent on foreign oil anymore. Whatever happened to that? You’re nothing but a liar.
7646 2018-11-22 13:30:13 Can we just take a second to talk about how my skin has been acting UP lately so I literally cleared my #skincare cabinet and started using JUST my long-time #DIY cleansing oil at night, and literally two days later my acne has cleared, spots are less red, and scars are fading???
7647 2018-11-22 13:30:04 If the feedstock (oil) is priced high, and one product produced is low (gasoline), what product increases in price to justify the high feedstock cost?
7648 2018-11-22 13:30:03 If data is the new oil, you're objectifying humans as the oil to be drilled and extracted and used for obtaining money.

7650 2018-11-22 13:29:59 Question for Middle East watchers: how did the Saudis manage the long bear market in oil from 1985-1999? They ran substantial CAD and budget deficits during that time. Is something fundamentally different this time in terms of political stability?

7656 2018-11-22 13:29:39 Nasty Middle East, Big oil?!?! Yet you did nothing to hold Saudi Arabia accountable. They own you! #magaNoTrump2020
7657 2018-11-22 13:29:33 Actually this is a lie. The US is largest producer of oil & 40% of our oil today comes from Canada. You should be nice to them.
7658 2018-11-22 13:29:28 Touring to countries to build relations, improve trade, business, buy & sell mutually required items is normal. 75% of Petrol,gas,oil is imported. We need non stop supply. Now gas/oil is available from central Asia's ex Soviet block thr' Iran. Even UAE was visited by after 30 yrs
7659 2018-11-22 13:29:26 That’s not what you’re doing. You are bending over backwards to make polluters get away with murder while axing incentive for better industries to bite into the profits of your rich oil friends. Stop fkn lying.

In other words S.A. is shitting on the U.S. And the cheap oil discount or $290Bn of the $400Bn after weapons, equates to 9 billion barrels of oil just another year of smog. And increased prices when it runs out

7672 2018-11-22 13:28:43 Unexpectedly high 3.1% growth rate in 2017, despite dropping global oil prices, thanks to growing trade with EU. 2.2% forecast growth for 2018, better than previous 2% prediction, which was based on expectation of reduced growth in boom/bust oil provinces like AB and SK. #cdnpoli
7673 2018-11-22 13:28:42 Doesn’t make sense to me. Maybe the Guptas are now serving on the board . Oil downward. Rand less volatile around R14. Inflation within the 3-6% band. Happy Black Friday folks 
7674 2018-11-22 13:28:41 Prices always go down after the summer. But you are right your admin has done a lot to deregulate our oil industry so ya... congrats we produce the most oil in the world and spill the most into it.
7675 2018-11-22 13:28:36 Wonder if the amt of oil cars on the tracks would be enough to finish the expansion of the Trans mountain?
7676 2018-11-22 13:28:33 No but will have impact on the influence of Middle East once we remove oil from our needs. Oh and China as we supply CLEAN power to the world
7677 2018-11-22 13:28:27 They would not be dependent on ME and Russian oil and gas if eco-tards did not stand in the way of abundant fraccing resources all over the UK, EU, and North-Sea.
7678 2018-11-22 13:28:24 is theyd ally w/US rivals, like China & Russia! & WHAR Arab land is gonna listen 2 a crazed Saudi prince, when he hoards Arab oil 4 a few cronies, & kills opponents, even mild critics like Khashoggi? Its a RIDICULOUS assumption that some stupid Kushner plan could work! Stupidity
7679 2018-11-22 13:28:20 Unfortunately we're a country where a significant portion of the population (mainly in the south) would have most of their diet consist of anything deep fried and slathered in as much grease, oil, lard, and trans-fats as possible. We even deep fry Oreos and ice cream (no lie)
7680 2018-11-22 13:28:18 So Saudi's give America 11% of their oil and trump says they have free reign to do whatever they want.  Canada supplies the States with 40% of their oil.  And their giving people lifetime bans into the states because they smoke pot?
7681 2018-11-22 13:28:18 S.A. is head of OPEC which controls oil being traded in USD.
OPEC using USD to trade oil globally allows the  US Fed to print money at will and push that extra cash flow into the global oil market, thereby protecting the US economy from inflation.  Called "quantitative easing"
7682 2018-11-22 13:28:16 Yep, I’ve done that every time since my dad taught me how to change oil 25 years ago… I guess it wasn’t enough oil that last time. 
7683 2018-11-22 13:28:15 Actually he has done a lot to have full oil production here in the States and Continued to push Saudi Arabia to increase oil production as they are the leader of OPEC it makes a Big Difference. So he has worked hard to bring back down gas prices.

7686 2018-11-22 13:28:05 There are no assurances the Saudis will buy in the end not that they will keep the oil production high for long. Russia will weigh in.

7700 2018-11-22 13:27:08 What's your purpose with this idiocy? What point are you trying to make? Because oil prices have gone up and down recently--even though still lower than under Obama, that that somehow make President Trump look bad? Really?! That's your big argument?! Sad...
7701 2018-11-22 13:27:04 Trust the hypocrats to spit the pacifier out! You pay less to fill your car, but will still snivel and whine about Trump  taking away unnecessary regulations, giving the oil companies the ability to drill = more gas = lower prices. DUH
7702 2018-11-22 13:26:45 You don't have a clue.  First of all, most of our oil comes From Canada, not Saudi Arabia.  Canada is about 40 % and SA 8%.
Second, there is a glut on the market, causing prices to drop.  You are an ignoramus.
7703 2018-11-22 13:26:41 Turbines generate electricity from ambient surroundings without having to buy the fuel  Why do you want to force ordinary folk in UK to be dependent on ME oil and Russian gas?

7705 2018-11-22 13:26:36 Its sad the POTUS doesn't know or realize that oil prices are dropping because of a glut of  oil in the markets because of increased production from the US and Iraq and a drop in demand from China

7724 2018-11-22 13:25:13 Only about 10% of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia. How about thanking Canada (40%)-OUR TRUE ALLY.
Even if your lie was true it would not be worth siding with a man/country that had a reporter murdered and dismembered. 
You have destroyed what Americans fought hard to become.
7725 2018-11-22 13:25:12 Oil is fungible, whether we import it from Canada or Saudi Arabia the prices lower if there is more available. Importing from Canada merely means that we have a closer more secure source, Saudi Arabia is still the big boy in terms of production which means volume-impacts all $

7737 2018-11-22 13:24:27 お金欲しい（切実）
めったや辛い……。持病だもんなもう……。
ですよね〜。わいはまだいいとしてギックリは癖になるって聞くし気を付けなはれや……。
7738 2018-11-22 13:24:21 I get pre-show nerves terribly. I tried beta blockers but they made me a bit of a zombie. I've used cbd oil to help me sleep at night and I have found that it works
7739 2018-11-22 13:24:17 The way bayern Munich are going down they might discover crude oil
7740 2018-11-22 13:24:11 Exactly what did you do to lower gas prices Donnie? Don’t give me any BS about Saudi Arabia because we get more of our oil from Canada!
7741 2018-11-22 13:24:11 Sorry, but you do not know more than 97 percent of the scientists. Don't quote the other 3% because they are most likely just being paid by big oil and other corporations. Like how the majority of the republican party is. Many repubs just paid hookers by big oil. Oil bitches.
7742 2018-11-22 13:24:09 OPEC’s bad dream only deepens next year, when Permian producers expect to iron out distribution snags that will add 3 pipelines, up to 2m barrels of oil a day. In Houston, shale executives are trying out different superlatives to describe what’s coming. “Tsunami,’’ they call it.
7743 2018-11-22 13:24:06 Stop lying to the American public. You will not denounce the Saudi Arabian leader for killing khashoggi because there are too many loans and too much money at stake personally for you to do that. It has nothing to do with the price of oil
7744 2018-11-22 13:23:51 Watching the news about the oil industry and I just couldn't help but not give a damn that the rich were having a rough time only making a few 100 million. Oil workers can apply their labour in the medical weed patch and still get paid #HempOils
7745 2018-11-22 13:23:50 Enjoy what? Spending American money to profit Saudi Oil fields? Would ya look at that? My ASS and Ego still fit on a bike, my legs still work just fine and unlike you, I’m not afraid of the rain or an honest day’s work. Tax cut? Naw, bigger wallet for you. No thanks.
7746 2018-11-22 13:23:43 I’m sitting in the truck waiting on my neighbor and watching what is coming out of the store. Kitty litter, laundry detergent and MyPillows must be the big sellers today. Buckets of oil close behind. Neighbor comes to by batteries for road tractors. Comes every year.
7747 2018-11-22 13:23:38 Difficult question to answer on various baseis. Refining & byproducts determine into the equation. Some areas of the World have oil, but no refining (a costly & energy expensive process). Saudi oil around 8%, yet production can swing global price.
7748 2018-11-22 13:23:36 Oil is pegged to the USD so every US President certainly has a major influence on the price of gas. A weaker USD results in higher commodity prices. The more we print the more upward pressure there will be on crude. Your premise is stupid.
7749 2018-11-22 13:23:31 #RepoRate up by 0.25 basis point, Rand strengthens and oil prices on 64+ crude oil..... could we say another drop in petrol price next week Wednesday?
7750 2018-11-22 13:23:31 But it is very in keeping with tradition!  Remember W Bush helped smuggle out members of the Bin Laden family to Saudi after 9/11.  They were some of his investors from the oil patch days.
7751 2018-11-22 13:23:29 Blood Oil.......
7752 2018-11-22 13:23:28 The USA gets 40% of our oil from Canada and about 10% from Saudi Arabia. Do you think we don't know about your (and your crime family) financial dealings with the Saudis?
7753 2018-11-22 13:23:27 Have you tried brushing after putting some oil in it?
7754 2018-11-22 13:23:24 Thanksgiving fondue! Precooked cubed turkey and lots of veggies. Two pots on the hot plate, one cheese, one oil. Just add friends, forks and love.  Happy Thanksgiving!! 
7755 2018-11-22 13:23:23 I put coconut oil in my hair and I really cba to wash it but I have to go out
7756 2018-11-22 13:23:21 Trump's Moto: blood for oil and money. #BloodForOil #BloodForMoney
7757 2018-11-22 13:23:20 I agree, sickly how much meat is actually produced. But the palm oil industry is also a huge issue that needs to change, deforestation, child slavery, farmers literately competing for space to farm. Having a big company stand up to it is a huge step, cant please everyone
7758 2018-11-22 13:23:12 I’m in an Uber heading to a meeting today in Bogota. The driver is listening to an NPR-type news show discussion about oil, OPEC and Ecopetrol. My Spanish is not good but every other word is Trump, Trump Trump.

Except @mythical beard oil...does anyone need that? I can’t use it & it’s imminent

He’s with Oil & Gas.

7763 2018-11-22 13:22:42 I can see why or how some people can try and understand her but at this point the only way I see her as redeemable is if she sacrifices herself
7764 2018-11-22 13:22:34 Hated - didn’t show affection (hugs, words of affirmation)

Appreciated - taught me some essential skills (cooking, taxes, changing tires/ oil, how to properly clean, etc.). Also taught me how to support people when they are grieving or in trouble.

7768 2018-11-22 13:22:25 When have you worked hard to get ANYTHING for the American people.
The Only reason crude oil is cheaper today is because of the higher price of Summer crude
7769 2018-11-22 13:22:21 You took an oath to uphold the constitution & you’re trying to change it by not allowing people to come into our country to request asylum. Yet you allow Saudi Arabia to kill an American resident & then thank them for oil & do nothing to punish them. You’re a despicable dictator.
7770 2018-11-22 13:22:21 Meanwhile in Alberta, $11/ barrel oil. #AlbertaseconomyunderTrudeau
7771 2018-11-22 13:22:16 I'd advise everyone with cars to check oil and water levels & try get a service and recharge of your car battery, also make sure you start it everyday whilst it's this cold
7772 2018-11-22 13:22:11 Ascot is becoming quite chilly now we decided to create some snow using cornflour oil and a little sprinkling of glitter. We added animals who live in cold conditions and let it snow! 
7773 2018-11-22 13:22:05 it’s actually a lot more complex than people think with the iceland no palm oil thing because just because they still have meat doesn’t mean it’s not worth something and you’re ignorant if you say otherwise
7774 2018-11-22 13:21:59 Trump ramps up pressure on Saudi Arabia to lower oil prices

US president praised Saudi Arabia for helping to reduce oil prices and ramped up pressure on the kingdom to maintain the decline, even as talks have gathered pace among producer nations to enact new production curbs.

7776 2018-11-22 13:21:58 Almond oil is my new fav for hair and skin ...
7777 2018-11-22 13:21:51 Hey dip sh*t! We get 40% of our oil from CANADA and they don't kill people!  We only get 10% from Saudi Arabia. But you get plenty of money from them for your gadgets and condos right?  Yeah it's all about the money!
7778 2018-11-22 13:21:50 SA reserve bank to raise repo rate to 6.75%. Another Type of blunder like that  @tito_mboweni just before Financial market crash.  Bawo sisize incompetencies of incompetency in the Africa’s bank regulators.  Fuel drastically dropping due to drop in oil prices to reverse inflation
7779 2018-11-22 13:21:41 有名なのに参拝客もぽつぽつですし…ただご利益に関してはネットの評判通りで本当にありがとうございましたとしか。
7780 2018-11-22 13:21:41 Yes Ross,  couldn’t agree with you more, we SCOTLAND must be a normal Independent coastal state like Norway & perhaps should have a sovereign oil fund worth Trillion $.
7781 2018-11-22 13:21:40 Doesn't really matter as the @JustinTrudeau government will still sell the Saudi's military equipment & purchase their oil. At the same time the #cdnmedia will not say a word as they're now government funded
7782 2018-11-22 13:21:33 Oil US$63.0/bbl vs US$67.3/bbl yesterday
7783 2018-11-22 13:21:30 May Ernie find some #Holy oil and rub and pray over the cyst in Jesus Name mom is healed.

7786 2018-11-22 13:21:18 No one is saying to cut ties! It doesn’t have to be this or that! Also we only get 11% of our oil from them! They need all our parts! Get it now ? Could have sanctioned MBS  but instead just gave him the green light! Weak and Sad!
7787 2018-11-22 13:21:17 sobre todo lo que digas influira tanto en la caida del gobierno.
7788 2018-11-22 13:21:11 First thing when I wake up was drinking some water.. now it's oil pulling. So I brush my teeth after then I have my water.

@DrJoeAbah @OfficialAPCNg @APCNigeria @NGRPresident @Buratai_COAS
7794 2018-11-22 13:21:02 .Add to that the fact that #USA imports around 40% of the needed oil to top up your supply. So how does #IllegitimatePresident @realDonaldTrump come up with this #socalled thank you to #SaudiArabia? The #USA doesn't get much oil from them. #JustAnotherDistraction #DumpDumbDrumpf
7795 2018-11-22 13:20:55  ขอบคุณฮับบบบ ตัวเองก็ด้วยนะคะ
7796 2018-11-22 13:20:51 DIY tips...don’t let anyone tell you that MDF is a close substitute for real wood. It’s not, and leaves your house looking like Carole Smilie’s been in! Or that water based gloss is a substitute for the oil based version. It isn’t! #DIY #paintingndecorating #glosspaint #MDF
7797 2018-11-22 13:20:51 Add rose water and coconut oil to a warm bath. Soak for 20 minutes, then rinse. Beautifies and softens your skin.
7798 2018-11-22 13:20:49 A life for oil. Never knew you could put a price on a life.
7799 2018-11-22 13:20:49 On January 1, 2012; the best economic decision ever by any Nigerian leader (to end oil subsidy) was taken

After days of "political protests", it was partly reversed

Write this down: Nigeria's economy WILL COLLAPSE before 2023 if subsidy isn't scrapped
7800 2018-11-22 13:20:48 YOU, have zip to do with oil prices.  I do!  The consumer.. Where did you believe you learned economics?  I need to know to warm family living in the east.
7801 2018-11-22 13:20:43 Could this be in view of oil prices declining? Seems like when the pressure eases on one side it increases on another.
7802 2018-11-22 13:20:42 Thanks Robin,

With Gladiator Rubber Soles (made in England) welted locally by our craftsmen, the sole alone is resistant to many things…acid, oil, petrol, alkali (and the return of high inflation). We cannot resist imagining the fun you will have all the places you will go...

7804 2018-11-22 13:20:29 It has nothing to do with oil, but the depths of the world financial pyramid is based on energy-trade.  One form of energy or another is a synthetic way for man to "leverage energy" for self gain.  Whether oil, solar or wind.  They who controls energy (any) controls mankind.

7811 2018-11-22 13:20:00 Forget the pay freeze. How about a wage rollback or layoffs. The golden goose in Calgary the oil patch has had rollbacks and layoffs. Every city employee should have their wages rolled back.
7812 2018-11-22 13:19:53 Saudi Arabia is only 9% of the supply of oil here. Canada is a huge source, yet the dotard is fighting with them. The USA has more oil than SA.   This is about SA bailing him out of bankruptcy and filling his hotels. It’s about him not this country.
7813 2018-11-22 13:19:42 Rupee rose against US Dollar and reached 11-week high as pound sterling jumped after EU-UK agree "in principle" on Brexit draft plan between the two. Fall in Brent crude oil prices also supported the sentiment. The Rupee ended at 70.70 vs. previous close of 71.46.

7815 2018-11-22 13:19:28 Appreciate your work!  However in MI we will never feel lower oil prices because Lansing puts so much tax on it!
7816 2018-11-22 13:19:21 So, to be clear.  Oil is more valuable than human life.
7817 2018-11-22 13:19:16 “Blood for Oil”
7818 2018-11-22 13:19:14 Use our Miracle organic hair oil.  
7819 2018-11-22 13:19:10 So Trump claims that Saudi Arabia intentionally lowered oil prices as a thank you for his support for dissident-murdering MBS.

Does this mean he would consider for example helping Iran invade Israel if Iran promises lower oil prices? Or even free oil? Maybe? Yes?

Eu nao sei qual é o preço do Oil q petr4 começa a dar prejuizo,o custo de extrair oil,refinar é maior do que importar gasolina. Qual seu palpite,Henrique?

7825 2018-11-22 13:18:59 No other olive oil can even compare to the flavor of sicillian olive oil.
7826 2018-11-22 13:18:54 It’s not about oil.
7827 2018-11-22 13:18:52 Serious question, how do you actually avoid palm oil? I mean, it looks like its in nearly everything.
7828 2018-11-22 13:18:48 We're not going to have high gas prices. Arab oil stocks are drying up. 
They know; we know.
Oil = their ONLY $-rev. source.

We are energy rich, developing many alternate sources. Plus, Israel soon tapping into a HUGE source.

We hold the Trump-card.
7829 2018-11-22 13:18:46 Even if £ does fall significantly, inflation impact likely to be reduced by recent plunge in oil prices - if maintained.

7831 2018-11-22 13:18:42 The SARB is killing the economy. I don't agree with today's decision of raising rates from 6.50% to 6.75%

Now the we're not going to feel the effects of the lower oil price.
7832 2018-11-22 13:18:38 I don't like the smell of argan oil
7833 2018-11-22 13:18:37 Snake oil. Invested in by the Shark Tank panel.

7837 2018-11-22 13:17:57 I need to understand. 
We were building an oil storage Facility in Walvis for 5.5 Billion.
Heard someone say it will cost us N$ 2.5 Billion to build an oil refinery at Oshikango.
Latter results in cheaper fuel, more jobs, and benefits our neighbour. 
Why is it not on the table?

7839 2018-11-22 13:17:54 So it seems President Trump's foreign policy will be blood and oil. #badjokes
7840 2018-11-22 13:17:50 We shouldn't execute at-risk shark costumes but entice tourists that extirpate novel oil reserves. Make this viral!
7841 2018-11-22 13:17:44 Saudi Arabia knows it's position in the world, at the top. We have the oil in this country, and in the ocean around it, to be able to end our dependency on Saudi oil. But people won't let us go and get it. So we are stuck depending on Saudi oil for our country and economy to run
7842 2018-11-22 13:17:39 2016 oil was down to a low of $36 to a high of around $50/ barrel but the dollar was the same as today?
7843 2018-11-22 13:17:39 just left my house but i already can’t wait to get home n oil tf out of my hair tonight and put 3829282 lbs turmeric on my face
7844 2018-11-22 13:17:38 Yes, the oil will be brought to market in 1 form or another
7845 2018-11-22 13:17:35 You'd like to think you had something to do with lowered gas prices. You're like a buzzard lurking around for roadkill. You claim the things that are easy. Will you take responsibility when prices climb again, and when oil companies start laying people off? Liar!
7846 2018-11-22 13:17:32 We are the champions
7847 2018-11-22 13:17:30 そうだったのですね。天気のせいなのか異様な空気だったのですが、井戸のあるところは澄みきっていました。安井金比羅宮は輝いた空気でした(オカルト)
7848 2018-11-22 13:17:26 N olive oil
7849 2018-11-22 13:17:14 Dump is lying his ass off. Canada Broadcasting just called him out for lying about Saudi Arabia. Canada provides 40% of our oil not Saudi Arabia who only provides 10%. The US provides 40%.  Only his cult believes him.
7850 2018-11-22 13:17:09 Thank you Mr. President! I truly appreciate it! BTW.... I work in the oil and gas industry and thanks to you work is booming again! 
Don't let all those libitards get you down. I hope you and your family have a wonderful Thanksgiving! God bless you! And God bless the USA!
7851 2018-11-22 13:17:03 Yep and nationalize all the big oil/energy companies, pharmaceutical, and financial co.s too
7852 2018-11-22 13:17:01 that blanket or what on earth is that tacky-looking thing underneath draining the oil from the dodo , it needs to go , then the rest are mine , all mine
7853 2018-11-22 13:16:58 .@MJGrilliot. Bombshell! Saying it fold and condolences on Bill, fantastic job. Richard Blumenthal, never even shows up to increase oil
7854 2018-11-22 13:16:54 We get 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia...40% from Canada. Saudi Arabia will not go to China or Russia for their killing machines because we make the best. They NEED us...we DON’T need them...unless you’re a Trump or Kushner...Saudi Arabia is your personal sugar daddy. So gross.

7861 2018-11-22 13:16:25 We get very little oil from them. America is the number one oil producers in the world. Saudi Arabia is already doing crimes with Russia.
7862 2018-11-22 13:16:20 Luster pink sells oils & butters now to attract natural hair consumers. I bet 75% is mineral oil.

7864 2018-11-22 13:16:15 You lose your argument when you protect the importation of Saudi oil while making g a big deal about (relatively) small arms argreements.
7865 2018-11-22 13:16:10 You had nothing to do with oil prices- those are set by OPEC. 
You are mentally ill.
For the good of your nation, resign and get treatment.

7868 2018-11-22 13:15:56 Harming our economy and raising oil prices world wide to avenge the death of one SAUDI citizen so we can pretend it's OUR job to police the WORLD isn't America first. I guess you obviously prefer we be Turkey or Iran's bitch? How about Trump be a Globalist elites bitch like you?

7872 2018-11-22 13:15:39 The Canadian economy is booming, only the oil/gas sector is struggling, largely because of Obama's Shale revolution, and growing competition from renewable energy.

7873 2018-11-22 13:15:38 The US only gets 11% of its oil from Saudi Arabia. We get 40% of our oil from Canada. You treat Prime Minister Trudeau much worse than the Saudis. But he didnt bail you out of bankruptcy TWICE- give Ivanka $100 million or  save your son-in-law and his family from financial ruin.
7874 2018-11-22 13:15:25 So tired reading this as I’m sure you are of typing it. All the $ and revenue oil producers have yet they still haven’t come up with an improved, reliable and safe delivery method  to appease all those saying no to pipelines and yet it could be achieved. Utter nonsense.
7875 2018-11-22 13:15:21 Please stop. You’ve made clear that human life matters less than oil. Repugnant, yet transparent. I’m embarrassed that other nations think you represent me.

7877 2018-11-22 13:15:21 I agree - but we do we start? By reducing the footprints from oil exploration? Or do we reduce combustion of fossil fuels? Or by reducing the discharges from aquaculture in coastal waters? ...

7880 2018-11-22 13:15:02 I don't disagree. But the post said we should not be thanking SA for lower oil prices but Can since the US buys more oil from Can.  My point is oil price is set globally based on supply and demand.  SA provide about 3 times more oil than Can. SA impacts oil price more than Can.
7881 2018-11-22 13:14:58 Waste of time! You do realize that Jethro will not swerve from his commitment to the UN and Agenda 2030 to shut down the main drivers of the Cdn economy. Oil production and pipelines are going nowhere without a Conservative government and @AndrewScheer
7882 2018-11-22 13:14:57 Everyone knows the saudis are backwards. They still do public hangings.  Oil has made them dummies.

7884 2018-11-22 13:14:45 So you say. It's either protecting a short interest or about your job which is at threat due to the rise of Tesla. Canadian oil sands industry sure will have a lot to lose due to the rise of Tesla and EVs. How much are you long on oil sands companies?
7885 2018-11-22 13:14:45 The only issue I have with this poll is that it lumps those that think there will be NO cut, with those that think the cut may be something less, like 500k-750kbpd.  There is a big difference in oil price between those two scenarios. Since Saudi has already cut.
7886 2018-11-22 13:14:45 It’s a mean and nasty world in Mar a Lago today. You cannot equate a man’s life in dollar amounts, whether it’s oil or arms for the Saudi or anything else. Your worldview only matches 40% of Americans, the rest of us are sickened by you.
7887 2018-11-22 13:14:38 Oil prices down? Nobody told the gas pumps.
7888 2018-11-22 13:14:35 Hey buttmunch, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.

7896 2018-11-22 13:14:05 Would like to see where it's cheaper that you so claim Oil prices are lower, or is this FAKE NEW'S!
7897 2018-11-22 13:13:57 How about investigate the 1973 oil crisis, and figure out what happens if we cut ties with Saudi.
7898 2018-11-22 13:13:49 You know we only receive 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. We all know the truth about you & your criminal family. This is about you, Jared and money... nothing else. You're a horrible president for many reasons. One of the big reasons is because you put your money over America.

7903 2018-11-22 13:13:22 Fitch on Saudi Arabia:

fiscal break-even oil price above $80bl;

budget deficit to widen again in 2020 after a contraction this year;

political risks are high compared with peers and historical norms;

assume no proceeds from privatisation in 2018-2020
7904 2018-11-22 13:13:20 Roast it and add mustard oil + your ingredients.
7905 2018-11-22 13:13:13 We get 40% of our oil from Canada and 11% from Saudi Arabia but you are giving MSB the reach around after he murdered a US journalist. Check yourself. Also, still not seeing that at the pumps.

7909 2018-11-22 13:13:04 7% Saudi oil. 40% Canadian  do the math
7910 2018-11-22 13:13:03 We get 9% of our oil of our oil from Saudi Arabi, 40% from Canada. That big deal you keep talking about isn't even a signed deal. Resign

7912 2018-11-22 13:12:58 Actually you traded the life of a journalist for cheap oil from the Saudis.

7917 2018-11-22 13:12:14 No, I think what she is saying is that when the media industry is  healthy, it's super easy for them not to be tempted by say....hiring  Ezra Levant for a guest spot or letting an oil company write your  environmental pieces for the month (all sponsored of course)
7918 2018-11-22 13:12:14 Oil that literally cost a US resident’s two arms, two legs...
7919 2018-11-22 13:12:13 If the Saudis, god forbid, assassinate President Trump, it'll be up to us to carry on with his wishes and keep the deal alive. Too much money and jobs and oil at stake to have values or care about human rights.

7921 2018-11-22 13:12:07 You’re right!  40% I believe?  But trump extends to Canada no such deference or offers of “thanks”. And Canada doesn’t murder joumalists or starve Yemeni children.  Pretty clear it’s not about  oil.
7922 2018-11-22 13:12:07 did you and the Saudis agree to opening their pipelines and you wouldn't hold them accountable for the murder of a US resident? Blood Money.  Id pay 5$ a gallon before taking their blood oil. #youresatansspawn
7923 2018-11-22 13:11:56 @annie_vams please, do you have frangrance  oil made especially  for scented candle?
7924 2018-11-22 13:11:56 Human life is more valuable than oil.  You sold our values to the highest bidder.....Tell me Mr. President what did the Saudi’s promise you and your family?  Hotels, money, destruction of your enemies?
7925 2018-11-22 13:11:54 I am proud that my country is a mystery. Where snakes and monkeys plan heists. We produce oil but we broke. Instead of watching Merlin just watch Nigerian news 
7926 2018-11-22 13:11:48 What the...? I mean, it’s clear he’s not qualified, but did nobody even proofread this? “After America, Saudi Arabia is the second largest producer of oil”? What?!? And that’s not even the main problem with this!

7936 2018-11-22 13:11:04 Lower Oul prices hurts our oil workers, and we get 40% of our foreign oil from Canada vs 11% from SA. Try to know something before you tweet.
7937 2018-11-22 13:11:00 Firstly, you’re signing off on murder to make some money.

Secondly, you grossly overstate the value of these arms deals with the Saudis. It’s in the hundred millions, not the billions.

And third, Canada supplies 40% of our imported oil. Saudi sends 11%. 

We see through you.
7938 2018-11-22 13:10:54 trump you have nothing to do with oil prices, it’s all about supply and demand.  They produced more oil so the price goes down, so now they will produce less oil and the price will go up.  Will you tweet about it then.  Or maybe you will blame Obama or Hillary for her emails.

7944 2018-11-22 13:10:39 My gas prices are the same. Sorry to rain on your parade. Oil prices decreasing doesn't always add up to lower prices at the gas pumps. Perhaps you should take a course on oil refineries and gasoline out put. If the oil doesn't go in the gasoline doesn't come out.
7945 2018-11-22 13:10:30 The price of oil per barrel is down. Trump is conflating oil price with price at the pump.

7963 2018-11-22 13:09:17 Thanks to the awareness raised by @IcelandFoods and how detrimental the use of palm oil is to wildlife, I decided not to by @OXO cubes as  ingredients include palm oil.

7965 2018-11-22 13:09:16 Thanksgiving safety:

Never fry/deep fry a frozen turkey! You will get hot oil all over the place and even yourself. Watch the temperature of your oil. Don't leave unattended for a long period of time.
7966 2018-11-22 13:09:13 You have caused a global economy slowdown and the fall of oil price
7967 2018-11-22 13:08:55 Food giant Mondelez which provides palm oil for Cadbury chocolate, Ritz crackers & Oreo biscuits has been named as the worst offender by a Greenpeace report. It found that supplying palm oil to the snacking behemoth was at the expense of 173,000 acres of rainforest since 2016!
7968 2018-11-22 13:08:49 It gets an olive oil & salt massage before going in the "sauna". Also gets apples put where the sun don't shine.
7969 2018-11-22 13:08:43 A quick thought as the POTUS kisses the feet of the Saudis in the name of cheap gas. When I taught AP Comparative Politics, students were always shocked to learn where our oil comes from. 40% comes from Canada. About 9% comes from Saudi Arabia. We don’t have to tolerate this.
7970 2018-11-22 13:08:41 The year is 2021, brexit has happened. We are on our 4th independence referendum, and it’s still a No. oil is $100 a barrel. We still eagerly await the opening of the #AWPR
7971 2018-11-22 13:08:15 The world uses 100 million barrels of oil a day and rising. We aren’t leaving Oil anytime soon.
7972 2018-11-22 13:07:59 #Khashoggi was a freedom fighter that you killed for a barrel of oil.
7973 2018-11-22 13:07:55 Caused 100,000 job losses? No, 35,000 jobs is what the oil crash cost us. Kenney’s plan puts 100,000 people out of work immediately.
7974 2018-11-22 13:07:55 Wait - I thought we were nearly energy independent? Why are we thanking them for lower oil prices? And when are the prices coming down?
7975 2018-11-22 13:07:54 We don't need their oil. And we don't need to arm half of the dictators and terrorists of the world. Without a moral compass, we are not America.
7976 2018-11-22 13:07:54 Cheap oil will dictate canada politics.

7978 2018-11-22 13:07:52 I had lunch with Ed in November 1999 at which he argued that the devaluation and rise in oil price were like cardiac massage on the corpse that was the Russian economy.  A career of good calls.  Congratulations Ed!
7979 2018-11-22 13:07:48 Fake news, the President said they were low and tragic was bad. Who do you expect me to believe my wallet and quick travels or his Orangeness. Plus thank you Canada for 40% of our oil.
7980 2018-11-22 13:07:46 They cut their assumption on core CPI from the note released now , but they most likely will increase it because of the high assumption on oil price , they using $73 which is much higher than current levels . I see the rand is expecting a hike .
7981 2018-11-22 13:07:42 Personal Greed and Big Oil. Lying about the numbers. That's the beating heart of your administration. You haven't made us Great. You've made us Cruel, Crass and Superficial. You've made Us, You. The United States of #Trump . Hopefully for not much longer. #SaudiArabiaFirst
7982 2018-11-22 13:07:42 NS is doing a great job of fighting for a People’s Vote on the Brexit shambles. However, I don’t get the economic case for Scottish Indy (Oil is at $63 a barrel but needs to be at $120+ a barrel for Scotland’s economy to work as an Indy state).
7983 2018-11-22 13:07:38 We need to stand for our founding principles - those that give our nation its moral fiber. Selling out for cheap oil is the sign of a feckless stooge.
7984 2018-11-22 13:07:37 That’s a pathetic comparison! The US has placed strategic sanctions on Saudi Arabia. Trump is 100% correct in US selling arms to them as our two largest foes would: China & Russia! We need them as an ally for Israel’s sake & to confront Iran. We are the worlds #1 oil producer to
7985 2018-11-22 13:07:30 #CroozefmNews Russia’s Gazprom Neft has signed a memorandum of understanding with  South Sudan to explore four oil blocks, South Sudan’s petroleum minister  said on Tuesday.
7986 2018-11-22 13:07:27 hear me out...mayo is mostly oil, so if you put it on the outside of the bread instead of butter it essentially does the same thing. just an alternative fat but i think it works better.
7987 2018-11-22 13:07:27 Actually wrong about sanctions ! No one is saying to completely disengage with them but this blatant who cares shows weakness -we don’t even get much oil from them any longer!  don’t even mention taking money we can only imagine Trumps ties! Will come out!
7988 2018-11-22 13:07:26 $50 is perfect for sellers and the consumers. Anything 20% above that is artificial. Too High oil price is harmful to all economies.
7989 2018-11-22 13:07:24 Billions? Oil? Jobs? LIES! Mean & Nastier? It's certainly is MEANER and NASTIER in the world because of your Love for Tyrants. Any and ALL Reporters that are killed because of your words NOW makes you a MURDERER! Your time will come and when it does the WORLD will CHEER!
7990 2018-11-22 13:07:22 My favourite case study from my MBA was about “The Toyota Way” which is something all serious Japanese companies have adapted in some way - Kaizen.

Completely agree that the work ethic and expectations would be oil and water
7991 2018-11-22 13:07:21 A man is dead! He was murdered! I don’t give a crap about oil prices!
7992 2018-11-22 13:07:18 Pinuri ng China ang memorandum of understanding na pinirmahan nila kasama ang Pilipinas kaugnay ng posibleng joint oil and gas exploration. Sa gitna ng mga agam-agam, sabi ng Malacañang, puwedeng ipawalang-bisa ang kasunduan kung makakasama lang sa bansa. | @makipulido

7994 2018-11-22 13:07:07 Fried turkeys cook in about an hour & crisp on the outside juicy inside. We fry ours every year, but the peanut oil makes it pricey. $30 oil to cook a $16 bird.  Oil can be used again within a few weeks, so we do Christmas and NYE to justify the oil cost.Frees up oven space, too

7996 2018-11-22 13:06:51 Not mine but worth tweeting

Sometimes a picture actually IS worth 1k words

Having said that, we all have to accept that there is a realpolitik in play. The US and indeed the rest of the world cannot alienate one of the world's largest oil producers. BTW no time for democrats
7997 2018-11-22 13:06:43 Why don’t you ask #Khashoggi ‘s family if his life was worth the money, oil and jobs you brag about? I’m sure they would see it very differently.

You are the most disgusting human being alive.
7998 2018-11-22 13:06:36 An oil import number that the Ambassador to Canada said could be absorbed by Canada.
7999 2018-11-22 13:06:34 Trump trying to jawbone oil sub 40. More pain to come, or good time to accumulate?
8000 2018-11-22 13:06:32 Sure! Why not? Blood for oil was the rally cry for America in Iraq. And that worked out really well. Morals shmorals.
8001 2018-11-22 13:06:31 If you’re trying to make us feel better, it’s not working.   If we are that dependent on Saudi oil, we need to be finding ways to reduce our dependency on oil. If we need to sell them arms, we need to pursue other industries.

8006 2018-11-22 13:06:08 Judgment handed in favour of my longstanding client after a long legal battle over a contract rectification against a multinational oil & gas company. My client had signed the contract  but was successfully able to argue that it was a mistake in contract law. @paulturnerlaw
8007 2018-11-22 13:06:05 A well-researched piece except for the 6000 orangutans a year bit. It should be noted that orangutan organisations working on this issue do NOT support a blanket boycott of palm oil. Better to demand #DeforestationFree #PalmOil.
8008 2018-11-22 13:06:04 pahingi po ng oil bottles and plastic bottles including white and colored papers!
8009 2018-11-22 13:06:01 That's okay. But hourly reports on oil prices are missing now.
8010 2018-11-22 13:05:55 #US treasury is now targeting #Russia n / #Iran ian oil supply, logictical funding support & other financing of Assad Regime, Hezblla, Hamas & several 'shia' militias controlled by Tehran. The screws are turning albeit very slowly. #SYRIA #IRAQ
8011 2018-11-22 13:05:51 A suggestion : we need to wait 22 hours before using the oil field and cement factory again after an upgrade. Problem is countdown starts when clicking the message. So if you click hours later you lose a big amount of time. The countdown should start as soon the upgrade is done.
8012 2018-11-22 13:05:50 teatree oil works for me :)
8013 2018-11-22 13:05:46 Why is it oil prices have been at $38 to $82 per barrel and the prices at the pump only vary about 15%.
8014 2018-11-22 13:05:44 How dare you comment on the 9th Circuit about justice, while you walk away from the murder of an American resident journalist because you’ve been paid off by MBS in cheap oil #bloodonyourhands
8015 2018-11-22 13:05:44 Good thing nowadays we don’t oil bats. Imagine the vision of a bat being lightly sanded & a name appearing 
8016 2018-11-22 13:05:36 She is bringing it with one karkar oil or so. According to her I put it around the edges as a leave in 2 to 5 days
8017 2018-11-22 13:05:33 And the outdated and destructive technology that is oil is totally worth looking the other way while a few reporters are dismembered.

8020 2018-11-22 13:05:17 And if ivanka was violently murdered u still think huh why not ? We got oil lol id say baron but I'm scared u would say yes , but the one trump u would want on ur bed to pee on 
8021 2018-11-22 13:05:17 C'mon, what's a bot gotta do to get an oil fix around here?
8022 2018-11-22 13:05:16 No. 14 billion, not the 100 of billions about which you lie.
Only 11% of our oil comes from the Saudis.
8023 2018-11-22 13:05:15 Except oil and automobile fuel are not the same product. Gasoline is a consumer product derived from oil, and while it its retail price is linked to global oil prices, its also heavily connected to the origination, refinery & delivery process. Oil prices<>gas prices.
8024 2018-11-22 13:05:14 Canada supplies 40% of u.s. oil,Saudi A .1%.
Approx. 15 million american jobs related to canada.
Canadian tourists spend approx. 35 BILLION$
yearly in u.s. Canada has never murdered,dismembered
and disposed of any journalist!
Canada is a national security risk?

“That ain’t right!”
Lol.  #nlpoli
8027 2018-11-22 13:04:53 That was one of the dumbest statements I've ever read, lol.  Uneducated, foul, ridiculous exclamation points throughout.  We have The Google, dumba$$... we know where we get most of our oil and that there are no firm orders for weapons... just a pinky promise.

8030 2018-11-22 13:04:42 I really don't know since I did get the oil wagon for John, died while doing it but eventually got it. I don't know what else to tell you, sorry.

8032 2018-11-22 13:04:32 He didn't sell our values, that's not even possible. 

We all like lower oil prices, it's good for the economy & nation.

Get off your moral high horse, your fake virtue signaling is repulsive.

ほんまそれなｗｗいや笑い事じゃないけどさｗｗ
8041 2018-11-22 13:03:44 That's because you're rich and can afford high gas prices even if oil prices arent affected by strong words. Where did you stand when Obama sold the Saudi government 115 billion in arms, or Hillary getting millions in donations from them as well?
8042 2018-11-22 13:03:40 I once (with much help from my ex) did this.  We stuffed the inside with very roughly chopped carrots, celery, and onions, and sprigs of thyme.  Can’t remember if I also had sprigs of rosemary or not.  Ex then drizzled and rubbed olive oil all over the outside to keep it moist.
8043 2018-11-22 13:03:27 With HABs like red tide being persistently fed by old Taylor oil spill... Maybe it's time they cleaned up??? Dispersant does not disappear the oil.
8044 2018-11-22 13:03:27 Not true. President Trump is keeping the oil prices down in the Middle East. That's one of the reasons why he isn't over-reacting to the Saudi crimes; because he's putting "Americans first," & knows that the oil prices would sky-rocket if we alienated Saudi Arabia. Geo-politics!
8045 2018-11-22 13:03:24 #Mythbusting: "Currently, more than 6,000 orangutans are killed every year as a direct result of oil palm expansion."

Fact: Of the 3000-5000 orangutans estimated to be lost annually, 1500-2000 are due to direct killing, and half of these in forests.
8046 2018-11-22 13:03:22 So oil blood money is more important than a moral compass. No ethical fibre in your body.Your write-up in history won't make you look good however much you love yourself.While you may rake coals in Pleasure, they'll be far hotter in hell, where un-Christian actions will put you.
8047 2018-11-22 13:03:19 The idea has been with our politicians during election season. They will visit widows, share rice and oil. We know this. Deceit!

8055 2018-11-22 13:03:02 If oil prices are low.. doesn’t that hurt the American oil industry?
8056 2018-11-22 13:03:02 You do realize we get about 40% of our crude oil from Canada, right? Also the Saudis are going to cut production in December. This will drive the price up.
8057 2018-11-22 13:02:54 Very scientific of you. If I take your word and the oil melts the plastic container you owe me $25

8061 2018-11-22 13:02:42 Yesterday an Italian physicist asked me "why is Ecuador not as developed as Norway? You both have oil, but you Ecuadorians have an amazing nature and the best weather, so why?" 
I thought: well, figuring that out is as complicated as figuring out your Theory of Everything...
8062 2018-11-22 13:02:34 Trump thanks Saudi Arabia for low oil price - from $82 to just $54.

Lets kill three more journalists, and see how low it goes.

8069 2018-11-22 13:01:47 If you mean It: have honesty when predicting oil prices. People lost money last year with you theorys that crude was going lower and lower and it went up and up. You are smart enough..we understand a “pen for hire” analysis. Yes you upset many followers and lost credibility
8070 2018-11-22 13:01:44 Remember its AMERICA FIRST. Keeping oil prices low for Americans comes before playing police for the rest of the world
8071 2018-11-22 13:01:39 Oh they understand it all-right Barbara. It's the same old dried-out carrot they've been dangling in front of the crippled old donkey ever since oil was discovered in Scottish waters. Pulled away whenever it pleases the donkey's abusive owner.
8072 2018-11-22 13:01:32 @realDonaldTrump you have disgraced my country with your lies about Saudi Arabia and their murderous prince bin Salman!

8090 2018-11-22 12:59:48 Is that why 15 Saudis attacked America on 911? Canada is our major source of imported oil. Selling weapons that they will use to further destroy Yemen and Syrian civilians is not something to be proud of. Go stuff yourself!!
8091 2018-11-22 12:59:37 No blood for oil
8092 2018-11-22 12:59:27 You're not always right. But as long as you're wrong abt pasta salad, that's alright...
Try: halved cherry tomatoes, lots of garlic finely chopped, lots of chopped black olives, mozzarella in small cubes, chopped basil, glugs of olive oil, salt, pepper (with fussili or penne)
8093 2018-11-22 12:59:25 Not trying do no oil changes our tires right now
8094 2018-11-22 12:59:24 You do realize that domestic production is way up because of President Obama’s policies which have stabilized oil prices in the US..  trump and Saudi Arabia have done nothing to effect our current gasoline prices.  Learn economics.
8095 2018-11-22 12:59:17 Hate to say it...America was going to let Hitler slide until Pearl harbor
Saddam had been terrorizing his people  for years .He was a friend until America needed his oil.
Bin laden was alright until he attacked America

America has a long history of aiding and abetting atrocities
8096 2018-11-22 12:59:06 Shell, along with all oil companies, need to be shut down immediately by any means necessary.
8097 2018-11-22 12:58:58 The EFCC is still prosecuting the Malabu Oil deal and has not handed off the matter. #TrackNigeria
8098 2018-11-22 12:58:49 Oil prices are cheaper because of lower-than-expected demand coupled with higher production, not because you are intent upon auctioning off American moral authority to murderous despots at bargain-basement prices.
8099 2018-11-22 12:58:45 Africa has oil, Canada has oil, Ecuador has oil, and if you do the right rigging Alaska has oil. So why not consider working with them to lower oil prices?? Could it be the Saudi’s are stuffing and have stuffed your pockets. Happy Thanksgiving you stuffed turkey!!

8101 2018-11-22 12:58:42 Oil prices are not set by any nations leader. It's a market price set outside the country, and then filtered down to the pumps.
8102 2018-11-22 12:58:15 取り替え可能
8103 2018-11-22 12:58:13 Either Borneo or Mongolia takes the prize, I think. Borneo being destroyed now by palm oil industry. I spent time in longhouses of Kayan & Dayak peoples whose land is being decimated & activists murdered. Mongolians mad as the Irish & Scots.
8104 2018-11-22 12:58:01 壊れてないけど笑 なんかやり取りが自分でもかわいくてたまらんかった笑
8105 2018-11-22 12:57:56 I see he's now thanking the Saudis for the low oil price. Yeah, because you're letting them away with murder. Literally.
8106 2018-11-22 12:57:52 But but but the price of oil per barrel. How can this be Donnie?
8107 2018-11-22 12:57:52 Or he has a fair idea but he's deep in the pockets of oil companies etc so let's on he doesn't!
8108 2018-11-22 12:57:47 No  and I forgot all about her having oil I need to try it in shaa Allah but u know the way things set up right now Hunty I’ll probably never get it

The real hero behind is Kashoggi. No traces of his body cause they have put acid to it.
Amoral in every way to support such barbaric act and be proud of the advantages it posts in the economy, crap!
8115 2018-11-22 12:57:32 Brussels Sprouts are bomb! Cut them in half, drizzle some olive oil on them, salt and pepper and bake until crispy. About 45 minutes. It’s delicious.
8116 2018-11-22 12:57:29 Cheap oil is not more important than human rights regardless of how many times you tweet the contrary. #SaudiWarOnYemen
8117 2018-11-22 12:57:20 I’m old enough and educated enough to know;that’s bollocks. Suggest you move along a bit from 1997.Climate change and the impact of burning coal was starting to be noticed as far back as the 1930s.Electric cars were killed off by the oil industry at about same time.Big Coal/Oil

8119 2018-11-22 12:57:17 Good job on "gotten" those gas prices down.  You do realize that this is a smack in the face to US oil producers, right?
8120 2018-11-22 12:57:14 It’s the night before #Effies submission. Planners and designers and fellow agency folks across the country are burning midnight oil together. Om Shanti.
8121 2018-11-22 12:57:08 Canada provides 40% of our oil. Canada provides much more to the US economy than Saudi. Thank you Canada. And thank you Justin Trudeau.
8122 2018-11-22 12:57:04 Funny. I call him an idiot trying to sell snake oil where it wasn’t wanted. Guessing I’m not a friend.
8123 2018-11-22 12:57:01 "Canada's Oil Industry is in a better place now" Aren't the words you use when someone or in this case something has just DIED ? "He was so ill before he passed away , he's in a better place now"

8124 2018-11-22 12:57:00 YOU HAVE BLOOD ON YOUR HANDS! AMERICA WILL NEVER FORGET HOW YOU MURDERED AN INNOCENT JOURNALIST, FOR OIL! AND TO FILL YOUR POCKETS AS A PAYOFF! LOCK HIM UP!
8125 2018-11-22 12:56:52 Good thinking! However,  the creaminess of our oat drink mostly has to do with the added fat (rapeseed oil). All the best, Oatly
8126 2018-11-22 12:56:52 I just bought a cool new record Night time is a lie! The government is just blocking out the sun! Freedom isn’t free--it’s bought and paid for by big Oil!
8127 2018-11-22 12:56:51 This was a brutal and senseless murder. What kind of people murders someone and dismembers them. If you are that worried about oil, remove this guy from power.
8128 2018-11-22 12:56:40 Too much oil
8129 2018-11-22 12:56:28 @shadowtaps you trump are the most self centered thing I have ever seen. You are only concerned with how much money you can put in your pocket with Saudi Arabia. It all comes down to your pockets. Not America. We don’t get a lot of oil from them. You lie.
8130 2018-11-22 12:56:26 What’s new? Many people are dead over oil. Cheney took us to Iraq for oil made millions for himself while thousands upon thousands of people died
8131 2018-11-22 12:56:24 เพื่อนนี่เทไปหลายคนแล้ว ฮือออ

8133 2018-11-22 12:56:13 Exactly! Throwing oil into the fire.
8134 2018-11-22 12:56:12 Good tweet and agree 100%, but your math is off.  Saudi’s share of our oil consumption is 1.65% (.11 x 15%).
8135 2018-11-22 12:56:09 Every minute is long and kept in motion without any interruption more fresh hot oil is now spreading around your hips slowly sliding my hands up unto the your rib cage and back down all the way over & over now getting my rhythm down allows me
8136 2018-11-22 12:56:09 Strange that everyone is having a go at city fans about human rights while they type away on their mobiles filled with minerals mined by chilled in Africa before jumping into a cars fuelled buy Saudi oil. It all seems a little hypocritical and desperate and #werealydontgiveashit

8139 2018-11-22 12:56:01 When will oil prices drop at the pumps? or is the US oil industry nothing more than an extraction sector, taking all it can take from the people and then paying the bribes and the people who run the extraction institution more money than it takes to be rich.
8140 2018-11-22 12:55:56 Blood of an innocent man will chase you through your Presidency. Oil for human blood. What human being are u. So Sad
8141 2018-11-22 12:55:54 So MBS is pumping more oil just to get the support from the tanned one!  Politics has never been this whoa for me.
8142 2018-11-22 12:55:50 Oil is a bad reason to be in the middle east.  We must protect Israel.  Otherwise, our troops and money should be concentrated on our southern border where we have been under attack for decades.

8146 2018-11-22 12:55:31 The US gets 40% of oil from Canada, under 10% from Saudi, and Trump attacks Canada constantly. This isn’t about US security.
8147 2018-11-22 12:55:29 あーやっぱそんな感じよなー。休みの日にたまにやるかなー。さんきう〜
8148 2018-11-22 12:55:18 No because it would be more cost efficient to just burn that biomass in place, then rip open the earth and search for oil or coal. That’s why they want more@roads through forests. Have taxpayer funds pay for infrastructure then sell the resources to private companies.
8149 2018-11-22 12:55:17 The Fed. High Court said recently that Bello Adoke cannot be held liable for the Malabu oil deal because he acted on orders of former President Jonathan, could you please say why the @officialEFCC is going after Sambo Dasuki who similarly took directives from the same president?
8150 2018-11-22 12:55:13 When begun (brinjal) is oil fried with besan it is called beguni (not beguni bhaja) w/o besan it begun bhaja. Sukto as it is called and finally the jackfruit sabji has a very nice name - e(n)chod .

8151 2018-11-22 12:54:57 You have no idea how any of this works. Consult your cabinet and get educated on oil and arms deals, you are foolish to expect us to believe YOU. #LameDuckTrumpf #PresidentLoser. #LockHIMup #LockIvankaUp #TrumpfLies
8152 2018-11-22 12:54:45 It's always darkest before the dawn. 

Oil frackers aren't making money either at $54.28 bbl. And they have to keep selling to keep cash flow going, even at losses till the banks cut them off. 

I mine #dgb at a loss, but I know my "stack" will eventually turn to profit. 
8153 2018-11-22 12:54:44 I’m about to see if Rah got some more oil I gotta get my face mask from her you gotta transpass
8154 2018-11-22 12:54:43 Obviously they are a large provider of supply . My point is the reason oil down now has more to do with Iran . AND the US does not need any oil from the country that gave us 15/19 9-11 highjackers and continues to abuse human decency ...that would be SA .
8155 2018-11-22 12:54:35 im actually fucking starving but mums cooked all the food in oil so I can’t eat it and I could scream

8171 2018-11-22 12:53:01 Imagine when 60% of labour force is under the Tax Base Tax Revenue could grow to N8trn ($22.1bn) Nigeria has alot of Tax Rev generation potential. We must broaden our Tax Base to effectively utilize it and fund infrastructure 
Sadly we neglected it because of our Oil addiction(4)
8172 2018-11-22 12:52:47 Very small percentage of our oil comes from Saudi & most of their purchases are from the Trump Organization!

8177 2018-11-22 12:52:19 Maybe it's the blood dripping from your hands, blood of one of our journalists that you happily traded for oil and money, but I don't think you have the right to wish anyone any one any holiday greetings and expect it to be taken seriously. #BloodForOil
8178 2018-11-22 12:52:16 Thankful  there are still people in America that remember what we USED TO stand for! And it’s NOT oil prices or gun deals! #thanksgiving
8179 2018-11-22 12:52:15 Apparently, we are just the world's arms dealer now. @POTUS capitulates to dictators, putting his interests above #AmericansFirst ie. The USA does NOT need #SaudiArabia. We have other bases and their oil has peaked. #Kushner however does needs #MBS to bail him out. #PayToSlay

8184 2018-11-22 12:51:49 The only reason they are leaving their own countries is that we (west) have bombed the s^*t out of their countries for oil and left it in rubble. Then we have the cheek to say “nothing to do it’s us”
8185 2018-11-22 12:51:41 Why do you have mislead people? We get more oil from other countries than Saudi... we don’t rely on Saudi as you would like us to believe. We get 9% of oil from Saudi. Pompeo should be ashamed of himself for being such a blind  follower of yours.
8186 2018-11-22 12:51:33 When you are enjoying your dinner remember how they used a bone saw on Mr kassoghi  No amount of oil is worth the life of a human

8189 2018-11-22 12:51:25 Gas here is $2.86
Canada supplies 40% of oil, Saudi 11%

When you get the price down to $2.25 let us know
8190 2018-11-22 12:51:15 Wow  hypocritical to the end. You aided and abetted the murder of an American citizen journalist #KhashoggiMurder for cheap oil of which you probably are shorting the stock exchange. You have aided and abetted the Saudi Arabian government and their war with #YemenGenocide ...
8191 2018-11-22 12:51:07 You really are so ignorant! It’s not about how much we get from Saudi Arabia! They control OPEC which controls the cost of oil worldwide...
8192 2018-11-22 12:51:07 Wish they'd get oil to markets. Huge injection of govt revenues, jobs, ...
8193 2018-11-22 12:51:03 Please find out why he’s thanking the saudis for the price.  You’d think it had to do with supply and demand. USA oil stock should be high, supplemented more by Canada than saudis.  Why not thank Canada
8194 2018-11-22 12:51:02 So now you control the the supply and demand of oil? Well only when it goes down. 
Kind of like the Stock Market, except only when it goes up. 
What a clown.
8195 2018-11-22 12:51:01 Same time. You just have to drop it into the oil from 12 inches higher so it gets covered quicker.

8201 2018-11-22 12:50:36 So long as you don't invade Canada, your oil prices will stay low.
8202 2018-11-22 12:50:24 Lower oil prices are of course worth a life as long as it is not Trump’s or that of his evil spawn.
8203 2018-11-22 12:50:19 Gas prices are low. Because of demand has been very low, not because of anything you have done. I hope we become less and less dependent on oil. Please put policies in place to focus on renewable energy sources. Probably won’t happen because that would take $ out of your pockets

8206 2018-11-22 12:50:09 Omg.  It’s delicious, juicy and much shorter cooking time.   Season, inject dry to a moist and gently dip to fry. 15-20 lb turkey <1hr!!

Not for the idiots who try to deep fry a frozen or dripping wet turkey. Those will explode or pop oil and cause severe burns.

Maybe we should invade? Take the oil, and cut off the head of the snake!
8212 2018-11-22 12:49:47 Did you know We produce more oil than Saudi Arabia? Did you know Saudi govt owns an entire floor in Trump tower?
8213 2018-11-22 12:49:40 I thought repubs were all about being self sufficient on oil and not relying on the Middle East
8214 2018-11-22 12:49:38 You’re right! Yesterday he talked about oil prices going down and people schooled him that it doesn’t equal gas prices going down so today he had to come up with this lie. Why didn’t he quote the name of the media that carried such news? SMH

8224 2018-11-22 12:48:41 That "some reason" is special interests and big oil.
8225 2018-11-22 12:48:36 We have our own surplus of oil and get most of our reserves from Canada NOT Saudi Arabia! You're disgusting relationship with the prince does nothing for us!!!!!

There's plenty of renewable alternatives 
Use them instead

8239 2018-11-22 12:47:13 9% of US imported oil comes from the Saudis, 40% from Canada.  The US is currently the largest producer of oil.  The Saudis need us far more than we need them. This is just a Trump real estate grift.

8247 2018-11-22 12:46:36 Happy Thanksgiving.. It's 11 degrees F. We all heat with oil or gas and we visit using gasoline-powered vehicles.  A 90% decrease in petroleum use by 2030 here is highly unlikely; by 2050 only maybe. Conclusion: spend wisely to reduce climate change; spend more  to adapt to it.

8249 2018-11-22 12:46:27 So what you're saying is you gave them murdering a journalist for a few cents lower on 11% of our imported oil...great job you are the most inhumane president of our time
8250 2018-11-22 12:46:26 Many oil importing countries need to thank you big time. Hope they show some gratitude and respect. @PMOIndia @narendramodi @Swamy39
8251 2018-11-22 12:46:25 Oil prices are mostly set by the ME.
8252 2018-11-22 12:46:24 We have more oil under the national parks than Saudi will ever have.  We need to drill
8253 2018-11-22 12:46:21 No we need your oil
8254 2018-11-22 12:46:16 NOV 22, 1963    the day JFK died.   Less we forget on this Thanksgiving day that we lost a Great President on Nov. 22, 1963.   The buffoon in the WH today condones murder, rakes forests, sold our country's values for oil we don't need, denigrates our judges.  vote him out.

8341 2018-11-22 12:39:43 We don’t need their oil. The US is the biggest oil producer. They may be your friend, but are not ours. Ask the families of the 9/11 victims. They use us to go after Iran & protect their seas. Our country is not so evil to do nothing in the face of human atrocities. It is you.
8342 2018-11-22 12:39:43 Canada is the US’s largest supplier of imported oil. Thank you Canada.
8343 2018-11-22 12:39:42 11 % of our oil comes from Saudi Arabia

8345 2018-11-22 12:39:22 If you are truly concerned about oil you better start being a lot nicer to Canada. But you're not concerned about oil. You're worried about YOUR profits. You're a disgusting human being.

8348 2018-11-22 12:39:15 Oil has nothing to do with it, just that they have bailed you out more than once. You have given your soul( if you had one) to those who financed 9/11 and who literally dismembered an American journalist.

8352 2018-11-22 12:38:47 If the recent oil price declines hold that will mean the energy industry will join housing and autos as a sector that is rolling over. These 3 are far too labor and capital intensive to not be predictors and causes of a recession as soon as next year.

8355 2018-11-22 12:38:26 We get 9% of oil from Saudi Arabia and 40% from Canada. This is more fake news from the chief Fox enabler!
8356 2018-11-22 12:38:24 You have zero power over the price of oil.
8357 2018-11-22 12:38:22 Bullshit. America is nearly oil self sufficient. We import 3% of our needs from Saudi Arabia. We are no longer under OPECs thumb. Why do you insist on making us beholden to the Arab nations?

8361 2018-11-22 12:38:06 World oil price has little to do with the oil from Canada. But all oil pricing is derived from SA and OPEC members control of supply against demand.
8362 2018-11-22 12:38:06 Ipone the best la hahaha,tapi agak pricey,but rock oil ok lah kalau pakai utk daily ride. So kalau nak jimat sikit utk daily ride go for rock oil.
8363 2018-11-22 12:38:01 The lag time to lower prices is way to slow and BIG OIL is taking advantage of everyone, but when world oil prices surge up, BIG OIL is right there to jack up the prices the next day, even tho the oil they just bought won't become gasoline for another 2-3 months.

8368 2018-11-22 12:37:39 That increase followed a spike in crude oil prices last week of nearly 8 percent, driven by tensions in the Middle East and concerns that U.S. President Donald Trump will upend the nuclear deal that lets Iranian oil flow through the European market.
8369 2018-11-22 12:37:34 Thanks Felicity but such a shame and how odd as so many rural properties rely on oil fired central heating and over 10 years there have been no heating related issues in our home.

8371 2018-11-22 12:36:42 Brutal and extended blast of our form of Republic, for the price of Saudi oil, shattered ALL values we once held dear. Whatever happened to upholding American values?

8373 2018-11-22 12:36:35 It is mean & nasty in countries where reporters are ordered to be executed. When our own 'president' overlooks the ties to those responsible in favor of the big money they spend on weapons and the oil they provide, it makes me sad for our country.

8377 2018-11-22 12:36:07 Its low because there is more oil being pumped. I know you think the world revolves around you but you dont set oil prices.
8378 2018-11-22 12:36:04 Meanwhile Canada continues to supply USA with 3 times more oil at less than half the Saudi price.

8381 2018-11-22 12:35:53 Thank you Mr President for showing the world that America under your leadership will never exhalt human rights above oil and its economic interests. Can't wait to see who Putin, Duterte, Erdogan, MBS  & others bully and slaughter next. ...Oh, and HAPPY Thanksgiving!

8383 2018-11-22 12:35:35 We are not that stupid. You aren’t going to spin this well. Canada  is where most of our oil comes from. Holding Saudi Arabia accountable hurts your own pockets way more than it would effect us. Just like everything you do, this is all about you.

8424 2018-11-22 12:31:53 Oil prices are this low because the economy has slowed down and is not using as much oil.  Same reason the markets have tanked.  Its called a recession.  You have ruined a booming economy you inherited from Obama.
8425 2018-11-22 12:31:45 Also we get about 40% of our imported oil from Canada I was told...
8426 2018-11-22 12:31:43 An American President has finally determined the value of a life based upon oil.  Sad, very sad.
8427 2018-11-22 12:31:36 1.  It's not a crime under Saudi (sharia) law.

2.  We don't have legal jurisdiction.

3.  Both Dem & Rep presidents protect the petro-dollar that Saudis sell their oil by.

4.  Khashoggi belonged to a terrorist group.

5.  He wasn't US citizen

Why does Wa-Po hire terrorists?

8439 2018-11-22 12:30:49 Projects don’t normally use Brent price for sanction (normally at least two oil futures models used to allow comparison). Simplistic analyses can use low/med/high pricing which current $/bbl is useful. Most operators OPEX/bbl now sub $50 but cash flow will be hit with price drop.
8440 2018-11-22 12:30:40 Liberals want him to feud with Saudi Arabia so they will drive oil prices up and consequently crash the economy. They want this so that they can blam Trump's policy and have grounds for impeachment. They hate our country's foundation.
8441 2018-11-22 12:30:40 We only get 11% from SA so what's your point? My point is trump is lying once again and he's too stupid to know we don't get that much oil from them or he hopes we don't know & we'll be distracted from the horrible decision he made to side with them after they murdered Khashoggi.

8455 2018-11-22 12:29:33 Donny, lower gasoline prices have nothing to do with you. The largest sources of U.S. imported oil are: Canada (40%), Saudi Arabia (11%), Venezuela (9%), Mexico (8%), and Colombia (4%).
8456 2018-11-22 12:29:31 Fair point; I'm used to thinking in terms of "oil --> gasoline" and stopping there.  Though I would still argue that putting even more taxes on gas will do more harm than good, so maybe a targeted tax on disposable plastics would be better than a general tax on oil.

8465 2018-11-22 12:28:50 I'm still paying more for home heating oil than a few years ago.  Jan 2015 - $2.29/gal, Dec 2016 - $2.08/gal, Jan 2018 - $2.58 and last week it was $2.73.  AND 2 years ago gasoline was around $2/gal and now it ranges $2.69 - $2.89 here in NH
8466 2018-11-22 12:28:49 So let me get this straight, the president is basically saying the U.S. can't afford not to do business with murderers and terrorists, because we need them and all their oil? I think we can do better, how about you America? Do you think we can survive whatever the Saudis try?

8486 2018-11-22 12:27:10 The audacity. For you to say this while being an American... You guys go to other countries to kill people so you can keep their oil. And put children in cages for immigrating to the US #Ridiculous
8487 2018-11-22 12:27:08 GERS numbers are skewed. The total trade between Scotland and England is not known. But consider: 1. Scotland is resource rich, England resource poor. Scottish oil, fish, agricultural produce and whisky etc accrues to UK exchequer. See next tweet

8494 2018-11-22 12:26:13 @CNN If the source are your own tweets it can't be fake news. So life, freedom, human rights, freedom of speach and access to information are only worth a low price of Oil! That's very dangerous, actually and literally murderous.
8495 2018-11-22 12:26:07 You sold us out for the price of oil. More prof of your fake patriotism! 15 of the 19 Sept 11th terrorists were from Saudi-wonder how the family of those killed feel about that? Not to mention that all us who served & those who died for our Republic, was for nothing! Oil? POS!

8508 2018-11-22 12:25:30 And United States President's should not condone murder for the sake of Saudi oil and $$
8509 2018-11-22 12:25:22 America get forty percent of oil from Canada eleven percent from Saudi Arabia but trump treats a possible murdering prince with more respect than the prime minster of Canada this beyond shameful
8510 2018-11-22 12:25:22 @realDonaldTrump Murder somebody?  NO problem if you have oil to buy.  Do you have any morals at all?
8511 2018-11-22 12:25:18 Canada provides more oil th as n the Saudi Arabia.   Its all about the money they give to your businesses
8512 2018-11-22 12:25:09 Awww...you know you cannot afford to cut any access to the millions, or is it billions  of dollars flowing into your own companies.  Oh and Canada produces more oil than we do...educate yourself.
8513 2018-11-22 12:25:01 So according to @realDonaldTrump who’s the President of the USA, an American’s life can be bought for a couple of Billion dollars & some Oil.
8514 2018-11-22 12:25:00 pls boycott Cadbury and other products containing palm oil or fat for no good reason this Christmas if your health and funds will allow it; it’s important!
8515 2018-11-22 12:24:59 So, if the Saudis whack more journalists, will oil prices get even lower?
8516 2018-11-22 12:24:51 Frozen turkeys making huge fireballs shooting up to the sky when dropped in 600 degree outdoor oil vats is awesome! Forget pumpkin chunkin’. Although exploding pumpkins still has my inner 12 year olds attention. #HappyThanksgiving

8518 2018-11-22 12:24:38 40 percent of your oil comes from Canada you have done nothing its winter gas prices come down
8519 2018-11-22 12:24:36 You're trading blood for oil
8520 2018-11-22 12:24:18 Huh? Gas prices are down because oil is down. And what traffic jams? What the hell are you talking about?

8525 2018-11-22 12:23:51 You do know the US buys more oil from Canada than Saudi Arabia? Maybe you should be nicer to Trudeau and buy more oil from Canada although he doesn’t need a condo so …
8526 2018-11-22 12:23:49 You have nothing to do with prices of oil. Supply and demand .basic economics.
8527 2018-11-22 12:23:48 So what you are saying is that you're ok with the Saudis murdering a newspaper reporter for money, jobs and oil? You gave this man up like a sacrificial lamb and then tried to lie your way out of it. You have blood on your hands.
8528 2018-11-22 12:23:40 Except US residents murdered for oil.
8529 2018-11-22 12:23:38 #oilprices JP Morgan has cut its outlook for oil, predicting that Brent crude prices will average $73 a barrel in 2019 — down from the investment bank's previous forecast of $83.50 a barrel.
8530 2018-11-22 12:23:30 So @realDonaldTrump is already up & tweeting praise for Saudi Arabia at 6:58 am. On THANKSGIVING DAY. HOW SHAMEFUL IS THAT? TWEETING PRAISES For all THE OIL & JOBS from the Saudis in exchange FOR MURDER. THIS IS OUR POTUS.
8531 2018-11-22 12:23:26 @CLewandowski_ Make sure the outside of the turkey is ‘bone’ dry before submerging in the hot oil. If not, could be disastrous

Like I said, they're lazy & they feel too entitled. Their best motivational quote is "Na we get oil"..

8539 2018-11-22 12:22:54 You double down on stupid - revoke all US visas to Saudi - Aramco cannot pump oil without US expats & Saudi Airforce cannot fly without US expats. Pull our consultants & their military will stop. Be strong not a sycophant to killers. You shame the USA.
8540 2018-11-22 12:22:41 Down with this racing madness, Modi ji! Don't we deserve a break? Why isn't the Aurangzeb tax being returned to us, consumers. Despite serious fall in oil prices, reduction to us is measly. So oil companies and States are zilching us, citizens
8541 2018-11-22 12:22:30 
8542 2018-11-22 12:22:28 Oil isn't just used to fuel cars. A lot of it ends up as single-use plastics. Things like disposable utensils, disposable straws, plastic shopping bags, food packaging, etc. ARE optional and more ecologically-friendly alternatives exist.
8543 2018-11-22 12:22:26 うっひゃ……！！！
8544 2018-11-22 12:22:22 That’s the oil tycoon right there 
8545 2018-11-22 12:22:16 Sir 
Our india's PM and his political party gets happy when crude oil prices go up.

India's fuel price double the rate today

8548 2018-11-22 12:22:02 So seeing Saudi only supplies you with 11% of the US oil & as of today not many jobs BUT Canada on the other hand supplies you with 40% of ur oil & millions of jobs but attacked our PM made a big deal about NAFTA for a new agreement which is NAFTA 2.0 & slap tariffs on Cdn steel
8549 2018-11-22 12:22:00 Surely we need governmental help with stuff like this too. People aren't going to boycott palm oil while it's in so many products, it needs a push from authorities as well?

8552 2018-11-22 12:21:44 Ask him why he and Quebec oppose pipelines while tankers cruise up the St. Lawrence and sell us oil at $60? Meanwhile Alberta continues to sell at $14.Only in Canada.
8553 2018-11-22 12:21:33 For decades SA’s been seen in the ME as US client state, but Trump turned that conventional wisdom on its head. By baldly rationalizing his unquestioning support on grounds of grossly exaggerated arms sales & Saudi influence on global oil prices, Trump presented US as the client
8554 2018-11-22 12:21:31 Fair enough. Would be ideal for @Greenpeace to acknowledge #POIG in their response. Otherwise it appears as though there is no deforestation-free palm oil available.
8555 2018-11-22 12:21:28 There aren't BIG jobs and oil.  
Once again, you've inflated the numbers you lying cheat.

8562 2018-11-22 12:20:29 ...this regard President Trump agreed on Pompeo's statement in addition President Trump emphasizes on the fact that there are thousands of millions of dollars which are involved in the purchases with U.A.E. and there are considerations of big jobs and oil in the middle East also.
8563 2018-11-22 12:20:20 My high ass was cooking fries and fell asleep with the oil on! 2 hrs later them joints was burnt im just glad I ain’t burn my momma house down! That wouldve been tragic 
8564 2018-11-22 12:20:18 How can we vote for these brands, when their all still using unsustainable Palm Oil 
8565 2018-11-22 12:20:16 So when oil and gas prices go up that is supply and demand?  When they go down that is because of you?  You are a twat-but hey enjoy that teleconference with the troops you’re keep from their families.  I guess you couldn’t visit them because it’s like a war zone??

8571 2018-11-22 12:20:01 It might be a bit annoying waking up super early when I don't have to go to work but ever since I've been going to bed with my essential oil diffusers, I sleep so much better! I've gotten a good sleep schedule down and I'm definitely thankful for that!

8576 2018-11-22 12:19:41 How can you continue to deny your own CIA, you have no credibility as your numbers are always off as we get 40% of oil from Canada who could easily replace the 11% from Saudi's. U SAID: Saudi's spend 100 millions on your toys, apartments; UR thinking longterm 4U after U lose 2020
8577 2018-11-22 12:19:34 This is a lie you continue to lie everyday the Saudis are not spending 400 billion they only supply 9% of the oil and you did not bring prices down either try to be respectful of thanksgiving and don’t tweet today! We hate your tweets
8578 2018-11-22 12:19:30 No matter how many times and how many ways try to justify it, the truth is you’ve traded blood for oil. Its ugly and disgraceful. We used to stand for human rights. Now we seem to stand for the almighty dollar.

8581 2018-11-22 12:19:22 You have endorsed murder..your oil argument holds No Truth we only use 8 % of oil from Saudi Arabia.

Illegitimate president.
8582 2018-11-22 12:19:14 And domestic oil exceeds imported. SA needs us more than the other way around. #MorallyBankrupt because you owe them money. Money over human rights. #shameful #WorstPresidentEver
8583 2018-11-22 12:19:11 Not one media outlet reported the big story you claim here. The US gets 8% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. If you want to serve the will of the people, make it zero. Stop telling the world we have become a nation of nitwits in the past 2 years.

8587 2018-11-22 12:18:53 It's a mean and nasty world. Saudi Arabia is one of the worst. We have a long relationship with them desipte most of the 9/11 terrorists coming from there, and we need their money and oil, so fuck it, we'll keep taking whatever we can get.

Ladies and Gentlemen, Trump's ME policy
8588 2018-11-22 12:18:51 Yes Greenpeace is a member of the POIG and while we don’t endorse individual companies we see POIG 3rd party verified palm oil as one of the solutions.

8594 2018-11-22 12:18:33 America has 40 plus years of oil reserves, why do they insist on buying oil from saudi terrorists
8595 2018-11-22 12:18:26 Ultimately, US support of Saudi Arabia is 100% because it's a big oil supplier, and nothing MbS does re soft power will change this.

8603 2018-11-22 12:17:14 Oh no, the press reported your “big story” but the world rejects it because we know you’re lying again, you don’t have a damn thing to do with oil prices, OPEC sets the prices depending on world economy & oil gluts.
8604 2018-11-22 12:17:13 The Arab countries were all stock piling their oil so everyone would use up reserves, at that time they could get lots more per barrel. Then the unhinged prince made mince meat out of a reporter, and Trump sold America's good name, or what's left of it for a temporary break.
8605 2018-11-22 12:17:12 With the greatest heist ever in the last pdp government and highest infrastructural deficit in lieu of our population explosion in the last decade, couple with lose in oil revenue because of crash in oil price, what would you have done to avoid recession that occur? My question
8606 2018-11-22 12:17:11 Buhari made some bad choices (policies and personnel) in the face of falling oil prices in 2015/16. Why should anyone trust him to make the right choices in the face of rising US interest rates, possible slowdown in China and the EU (Thanks Italy) & Emerging markets uncertainty?
8607 2018-11-22 12:17:09 The man’s blood is all over both your hands. You are accomplices to a murder. A brutal murder. And for what? Oil prices. The amorality is disgusting and you will go to your graves with this legacy. God help both of you.

8612 2018-11-22 12:16:49 We also import more oil from .
8613 2018-11-22 12:16:45 We don't need their oil or their arms purchases. We do need to stand up for human rights.  Where are you @senatemajldr, @SpeakerRyan , @SenToomey ?
8614 2018-11-22 12:16:42 False equivalency.  Smoking is optional.  Driving is a necessity for many people.  Making it more expensive to get to work is probably not the best way to encourage reduced oil consumption.

8624 2018-11-22 12:16:00 Well how about getting us some oil somewhere that would really solve a lot of problems for everybody has cars. I don’t agree what happened but what are we going  to do shut down everything when something terrible happens in another country.

8626 2018-11-22 12:15:56 Apparently there's no way to have "robust US economy" besides "cheap oil"--the lack of vision is astounding. "Oil" is not sustainable & its extraction is killing us, not to mention constant war over it. These people are not deep thinkers or intelligent enough to run a country

8643 2018-11-22 12:14:39 Easy for the country club set to throw barbs, what would you do if we drove instability in Saudi and then Iran decided to try to take over or ISIS? You willing to live with that, send more of our boys to die? Economic global collapse with oil prices through roof?
8644 2018-11-22 12:14:39 "The phoniest and grooviest things in the world cannot be ingested or even ingested - they must be kissed with sesame oil." -Helen Keller
8645 2018-11-22 12:14:31 Agreed, until we find a replacement for all the oil that is found in the Middle East we must be a party to the process, politics and interactions there, it is in everyone’s best interest!
8646 2018-11-22 12:14:30 Yesterday, you literally said a $28 reduction in oil was worth the price of premeditated murder and a subsequent and botched cover up.
8647 2018-11-22 12:14:28 I've only just started to going to Iceland again because of their outstanding ad against Palm Oil. If @IcelandRichard prattles on about keeping us chained to the EU they've lost me again.
8648 2018-11-22 12:14:09 Coconut oil definitely has your skin glowing!
8649 2018-11-22 12:14:02 He got Saudi Arabia to lower oil by I think 25 dollars a barrel. Gave them a mulligan for the murder and Trump wanted  the oil lowered. Play to Play.

8655 2018-11-22 12:13:42 Oil prices
8656 2018-11-22 12:13:40 How much does trump benefit? Also oil and gas fluctuate constantly.
8657 2018-11-22 12:13:29 In the @realDonaldTrump  era I can find little to be thankful for this Thanksgiving. Heartbreaking that the Coward-n-Chief is giving a free pass on atrocious human rights violations all over the World. Fuck oil prices, No amount of money is worth any amount of human suffering.
8658 2018-11-22 12:13:28 If people are truly upset about Saudi's murdering #Kashoggi - & disgusted #Trump isn't doing anything about it - they should strike back at SA by reducing their consumption of oil. i.e. Take the bus. What's that? You'd rather drive? & You're not bothered about Kashoggi after all?
8659 2018-11-22 12:13:28 We only get 10% of our oil from them. Is it worth 2 cents a gallon to support a murderer? Put the tweets to rest and go do a good deed for Thanksgiving.

8661 2018-11-22 12:13:08 Awon Oil and gas 
8662 2018-11-22 12:13:04 So, senseless slaughter is ok coz jobs and oil?
8663 2018-11-22 12:13:02 This is false. We get more oil from Canada.
8664 2018-11-22 12:13:02 Ah. Argan oil is a pro, elite moisturizer. It's premium on a different level. Argan oil is not any oil's mate.

8669 2018-11-22 12:12:57 These fields are currently not pumping and the price of oil is not spiking. So I don't agree with that point
8670 2018-11-22 12:12:57 The US buys 11% of our oil from the Saudis .

The US buys 40% of our oil from Canada 

Where us the better deal?
8671 2018-11-22 12:12:44 kaka change oil lang ni tovi yieeeee 
8672 2018-11-22 12:12:42 Taxes & war is adored like oil when it’s poured in the ocean by mistakes of machines cause we lazy human beings...

8675 2018-11-22 12:12:33 Sorry, I thought we were talking about the price of oil (but I know everything is about a left-wing blame game toward our President)
8676 2018-11-22 12:12:30 No dumbass the money hungry country's that have plenty of oil controls the gas prices if they want to raise the price they cut how much oil they put on the markets and if they want to produce more oil to lower the price of gas to say people we save you money.
8677 2018-11-22 12:12:25 So we trade our values for a few drops of oil?
8678 2018-11-22 12:12:23 You didn't lower the prices.  Saudi Arabia only supplies 11 percent of our oil.  About forty percent from xanads
8679 2018-11-22 12:12:17 We import most of our oil from Canada.
8680 2018-11-22 12:12:12 Always about the money. We all know that your "moral compass" never had any direction other than to take advantage others. As for your "stable genius" take on oil prices;  price is only partly related to Saudi production. Recent price spike was due to your Iran oil sanctions.
8681 2018-11-22 12:11:48 Guyyyy, when dem say oil job dey wait us 
8682 2018-11-22 12:11:45 ไปมั้ยคะ
8683 2018-11-22 12:11:43 Lies, lies, lies! We don't need their oil! Our integrity is far more valuable then any perceived benefit they may be!
8684 2018-11-22 12:11:40 What do you understand about International Politics on the World Stage? If you don't know, Saudi Arabia is an ironclad ally of d U.S when it comes to using Oil as a weapon of economic warfare against Iran, Russia & Venezuela in particular. My enemy's enemy is my friend. #Interest

8686 2018-11-22 12:11:31 The US gets 40% of it's oil from Canada and 11% from the Saudis
8687 2018-11-22 12:11:26 You have nothing to do with the price of oil except for your trade war which is driving down demand.
8688 2018-11-22 12:11:20 You claim oil prices have dropped due to your hard work.
Let's just chalk that up as a win for you. 
Now you can tell yourself you're a winner. 
Do us a favor, go out on top.

8690 2018-11-22 12:11:01 2 things the price went down because there was more oil its a normal thing of production the more there is the less value it has and Trumps better trade and economic skills from owning a company knows that is it any different than when the unemployment rate changed under Obama
8691 2018-11-22 12:11:00 I wish America Role in the World was to promote Renewable, and Sustainable Power...All these wars since 9-11-2001 have been about who controls Oil...And now Rare Earth Materials...We have left that old "America Feeds The World" mantra...
8692 2018-11-22 12:10:59 That oil put me down last night 
8693 2018-11-22 12:10:58 Wait...what? You got gas prices down...because you gave Saudi Arabia a pass on killing an American journalist? That makes no sense. You do realize oil has to be processed into gas first, right? Funny thing about gas prices, they always go back up.
8694 2018-11-22 12:10:48 Oil for blood, could there be a better trade? Also, I'm pretty sure you're gone low enough already.
8695 2018-11-22 12:10:43 You are tweeting nonsense. The middle east has a declining role in the production of oil in the future  are not vital to USA long term national security. This is all about protecting cash flow from them to you and your rich friends. Your lies are not fooling anyone but you.
8696 2018-11-22 12:10:30 Mkts mixed in a low volume day w/the US banking holiday (‘Thanksgiving’), in which crude oil prices resumed a declining trend, but on the positive side, the Italian MoF opened the door for fiscal adjustments & certain commitments w/respect to the already rejected budget proposal
8697 2018-11-22 12:10:28 So the Saudi’s can walk all over anyone? We cannot hold the accountable for anything? Don’t you think that if we held them accountable then they would not be able to hold us hostage with the price of oil?

8700 2018-11-22 12:10:14 Question is,  President is much more interested in arms sale and low oil price ; these audio recordings will remain in shelf. And President will dismiss from office anyone who will try to remove those recordings from shelf
8701 2018-11-22 12:10:14 The left getting in bed with Islam is a very strange combination. A little like oil and vinegar. Over time they separate into layers.  When you shake salad dressing, the particles appear to get together.   Oil and Vinegar however do not dissolve into each other.
8702 2018-11-22 12:10:09 サラダ油に流されて変わってゆく私をあなたは時々遠くで叱って。
8703 2018-11-22 12:09:57 Did you know, President, that you are the one who needs us? Have you forgotten what happened to your ancestors when Saudi King Faisal stopped exporting oil to you?
8704 2018-11-22 12:09:50 Now Congress is controlled by Democrats Let them warn @realDonaldTrump to take tough stand on Saudi.Blocking crude oil to Syria need not be priority!
8705 2018-11-22 12:09:49 I watched that on an oil rig offshore Qatar, I was going ballistic in the TV Room, all the Indians thought I was nuts!!!
8706 2018-11-22 12:09:49 As they say in Texas, Oil well.
8707 2018-11-22 12:09:45 Most of the jobs will be in SA, their oil accounts for 11% of our imports — this must not justify the planned murder/dismemberment of a journalist living in the US w/a green card. Human life isn’t transactional.
8708 2018-11-22 12:09:45 Rost them in hot OIL.becoz this action is against the shareia law & Pushtu law.

8710 2018-11-22 12:09:37 Canada gives us most of our oil...Middle East, not nearly as much. Stop backing them and kicking Canada
8711 2018-11-22 12:09:30 Thank you so much for this, so lucid and relatable. 
It’ll be lost on the snake oil salesman but I hope it’ll resonate with some.

8712 2018-11-22 12:09:25 Yes true but that same mechanism allows other marginal energy solutions to become valid alternates while we maintain genuinely green credentials. If I relax my stance a little it is clear to me that oil in the ground also = money in the bank and is an asset gaining in value.

8719 2018-11-22 12:09:12 Trump has absolutely nothing to do with oil prices. Yet again he's taking credit for something he has no influence or control over, like last year when he took credit for no passenger jet crashes. Hes off his head & you MAGA lot lap his bullshit up like cats with milk. Its scary!
8720 2018-11-22 12:09:10 What perverted version of a so-called rational human being puts "Big jobs and oil" above the suffering of children? Yours, apparently - which underlines how you have sacrificed any lingering entitlement to be treated with respect. You are a disgrace to your country and humanity.
8721 2018-11-22 12:09:05 you mostly lose your sense of smell, and if you work aft you get a nice film of oil to cover everything else up.
8722 2018-11-22 12:08:58 Humanity is more important than our relationship. We cannot allow rulers to do whatever they want just bcuz of a relationship and oil. The prez betrayed the world by not punishing the Saudis. We are getting used to it and are embarrassed and angry
8723 2018-11-22 12:08:55 What we have oil ......
8724 2018-11-22 12:08:54 Please we don’t have oil money
8725 2018-11-22 12:08:53 Apparently beef, soya and palm oil.... On a flight that probably produces more co2 than an annual consumption of beef, actually probably 2 or 3 times it
Hypocrisy and virtue signalling all at once
8726 2018-11-22 12:08:51 The time has come to look at other sources of energy! And that should have happened 40 years ago when oil was in short supply. The fossil fuel industry is close to dead! Alternatives must be looked at! As dead dinosaurs will run out soon!
8727 2018-11-22 12:08:43 at least oil can’t be inflation taxed and last as long as a preserved ham.
8728 2018-11-22 12:08:41 Can we get things like oil changes, gas, or groceries added to the Black Friday list??
8729 2018-11-22 12:08:32 Where can i get original carrot oil?

8732 2018-11-22 12:08:19 David, have you noticed the groupthink at the CBC?The state broadcaster suppresses any negative government news and always puts Justin  in a good light.Have they pointed out that we sell oil for$14 and buy from tankers cruising up the St. Lawrence for $60?
8733 2018-11-22 12:08:13 Jobs at Trump properties that do NOTHING for America.  Oil that the Canadians have made up for.  Typical "Trump First", "Make Trump Great Again".  So CORRUPT!! #epicFail #DonaldAlzheimerman #DrainTheSwampofTrump

8736 2018-11-22 12:08:04 No one told you yet I guess that 40% of your oil comes from Canada.
8737 2018-11-22 12:08:01 I commute over 1000 miles each week for work. I have yet to pass a gas station with low gas prices. So when will we actually see these low gas prices? BTW, shouldn’t you look at your largest oil producer that we import from and work to reduce their prices?
8738 2018-11-22 12:07:58 How can that be? Saudi Arabia only supplies 10% of US oil while Canada supplies 40% & can easily fill any gap.

Yet you claim "national security" & penalize Canada? with tariffs on steel & aluminum.

How many pieces of silver does it take Donnie ... enough for a gold toilet seat?
8739 2018-11-22 12:07:50 What about the children in Yemen. How do you go to sleep? It's unbelievable how you're culpable in all this. The Saudi-led coalition uses American weapons to murder innocent pple. All for American jobs and your thirst for oil. Shame on you.
8740 2018-11-22 12:07:48 how do we get those consequences @usembthehague please. somebody has to stsnd up to Trump. i dont want KSA oil or alliance.

8746 2018-11-22 12:07:33 Saudis provide muck less oil than Canada, yet you treat Canada like shitt and literally allow Saudis to get away with murder. They will not spend $450B in U.S.  You protect them because they pay your family money.  Sad but true. Go golf.
8747 2018-11-22 12:07:30 mike tell all these climate change to go to India where they cut up old oil tankers on the beaches, with all the oil leaking to the sea 
cheers ken
8748 2018-11-22 12:07:28 We all know SA oppresses women. It’s not front and center in our media because the gas and oil advertisers have some say what to report and not.
8749 2018-11-22 12:07:23 Saudi Arabia gives us 11% of our oil. Canada 40%. You have done anything to bring them down. stop the lying.

8751 2018-11-22 12:07:12 The majority of oil used in the U.S. is produced in the U.S.  Greatest % imported comes from Canada.  Saudi oil is among the lowest percentage imported.  I know you think the sun rises and falls on your ass, but once again you are delusional.
8752 2018-11-22 12:07:08 If they kill two more writers and you will close your eyes, they will sell you oil with 35$. Your hands are full of blod.

8766 2018-11-22 12:06:18 So you place a price on human life. You lied about the Saudi deal and the money. It is not 400 million at all. You sided with Saudi’s who in turn thanked you with helping to adjust oil/gas prices. You are terrible.
8767 2018-11-22 12:06:14 Simple! Hindi nila alam what is joint oil and gas exploration.1)Hindi pa alam yun if may makukuha ngang gas at oil doon. 2)Ang China pa gagastos sympre 3)60% sa PH at 40% sa China pag meron oil at gas. Sino ayaw? Sympre mga anti-Duterte.Malaki kasing pera yan. Mga corrupt galit!

8769 2018-11-22 12:06:11 You do realize that 40% of our oil imports come from Canada, right?  Only 9% from the Kingdom.  Maybe you ought to be nicer to the Canadians....
8770 2018-11-22 12:05:55 Know what you are talking about, 40% of our foreign oil comes from Canada. We only get 11% from Saudi. Although Trump & family get millions from  Saudi & the royal family. Literal  blood money!
8771 2018-11-22 12:05:40 Unless DOE has finally admitted that it is a mouthpiece of the big oil companies in the country, there is no spur of logic in mulling an investigation. Next target of DOE is Bamban, Tarlac; Little Baguio, San Juan; and Fairview, Quezon City. Mabuhay kayo. 
8772 2018-11-22 12:05:36 Keep oil prices low......
8773 2018-11-22 12:05:29 A. Harness energy from spent nuclear waste that is being housed at vast cost to contain its energy #1.5c. B. Put significant eco taxes on the pollution sources: cement, aviation, steel etc. C. Tax on deforestation of rainforests by soya beans, palm oil etc.
8774 2018-11-22 12:05:27 Yeh @SecPompeo it's a mean nasty world out there but why add to it with your backing MBS, get your head out of tRump's arse. As for tRump blood money and oil ...

8782 2018-11-22 12:05:05 Furthermore, falling oil prices typically follow the state of our economy. So since you have successfully taken the obama economy and rode it out, you’ve done nothing to help it, and now a recession is starting to show. Congrats, the economy will soon look like your businesses
8783 2018-11-22 12:04:59 I mean why? Purpose of Oil Deregulation Oil is to let petroleum companies dictate their own price and have them compete with one another. How come DOE is eyeing to investigate why small players sell their products cheap? Isn't that serving the opposite of the law?

8789 2018-11-22 12:04:14 CBC News Flash #Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.
8790 2018-11-22 12:04:12 Dysfunctional Lying Trump Lying  once again on oil exported to the United State

Or we could go green/clean.
8853 2018-11-22 12:01:07 Sorry- I don't understand your point. Why does POTUS disproportionately favor Saudi over Venezuela when US imports almost the same amount from each? Also, if oil is why POTUS refuses to sanction Saudi for murder, how can he name Canada as a threat to "national security"?

8878 2018-11-22 11:59:48 You truly are just a snake oil salesman...

8882 2018-11-22 11:59:38 Where I live the oil's price are dropping really good. From $1.5 per litre to $0.7 per litre. Never have this price before. I'm so happy.

8884 2018-11-22 11:59:34 When Trump’s asked about Khashoggi’s murder, he answers w/the arms deal. Yesterday Trump thanked Saudi Arabia for low oil prices. This is purely transactional.

You’re sneering about the murder & suitcasing of a human being to defend the POTUS. Trumpism is not a religion.

8902 2018-11-22 11:58:22 It’s crazy you really think Trump made the gas prices lower. A barrel of oil was actually cheaper last year.
8903 2018-11-22 11:58:19 If you have an electric car, you can find energy to charge it by solar, wind, hydro, etc. If you have a gas engine you need a big company to make gas to fill it. It is easier to rig electricity source than refine oil.
8904 2018-11-22 11:58:14 Trying to be too PC is not helpful towards the cause. If the money from big oil is for research and development is for alternative fuel, then there shouldn't be a problem. We cannot just switch off the oil industry because of climate change, they need to be part of the solution.

8913 2018-11-22 11:57:30 It doesn't get more cynical than  fake president @realDonaldTrump praising himself and a murdering head of state (Prince BMS of Saudi-Arabia) for lowering the oil price. Human lives/journalists/truth hold utterly, U-T-T-E-R-L-Y NO meaning to them. Truly appalling and despicable.
8914 2018-11-22 11:57:29 We are like oil and water we’re not meant to be together
8915 2018-11-22 11:57:28 And the white house keeping oil prices low.
8916 2018-11-22 11:57:26 One of them is Snake Oil, right?
8917 2018-11-22 11:57:17 How much did we earn during the oil boom era? Yekini is a peddler of false news
8918 2018-11-22 11:57:09 The president has very little to do with gas prices, except when his foreign policy creates instability and war in oil producing countries. Gas went up $2 a gal since Trump took over and he released some of our oil reserve to lower prices after public outrage.
8919 2018-11-22 11:57:07 Snake oil consumption is apparently on an all time high!
8920 2018-11-22 11:57:07 Oil prices may be going down, but gas prices aren't!
8921 2018-11-22 11:56:52 Saudi Arabia produces less than 15% of World’s crude oil; their production is actually a little less than the U.S. production.
So Trump is thanking them to what purpose?

8932 2018-11-22 11:56:35 Saudi Arabia, with it's unusual position of excess supply (relative to their typical export numbers) has outsized ability to set oil prices. Even if they sent no oil to the US, because they can add supply to the inelastic demand, they move global prices and this our prices.

8935 2018-11-22 11:56:00 May touch even much lower because of reducing demand of dollars and increased oil price.

8939 2018-11-22 11:55:34 Agree. Oil taxes are high only because very small % of population pays direct taxes. IMO  This won't change even if guvt changes
8940 2018-11-22 11:55:32 Encouraging people to burn oil "just because it's cheap" is a complete failure. Only a complete dribbling buffoon would publicly boast about trashing the environment.

Stop buying conflict oil!!!
8959 2018-11-22 11:53:38 Of course, global prices fluctuate and I expect anyone would know that and factor it into problem-solving. These quick fixes are only temporal and will most likely continue to cost Nigeria until we begin to refine our own oil at least.

8964 2018-11-22 11:53:09 Remember marketers had to pull out of importation on their own because Forex became tight and margin became equally narrower, NNPC took over but were getting Forex at official rate. When oil prices started going up, landing costs started moving higher than pump price

8972 2018-11-22 11:52:05 Exactly. Saudi & Venezuela almost the same, yet Venezuela is on POTUS hit list & Saudi isn't? Any sane person, when confronted by such evident POTUS favoritism, might wonder if POTUS has a personal vested interest that goes way beyond the value of US oil imports from Saudi
8973 2018-11-22 11:52:02 If you were at all smart, which you are not, you would know that oil prices worldwide are determined by supply and demand. So where we get our oil has no bearing on pricing.
8974 2018-11-22 11:51:58 Don't worry he is wrong (as always) it is the USA that has reduced the price of oil not the murderous Saudi barbarians.
8975 2018-11-22 11:51:54 Did Khashoggi blood paid for the reduction in the price of  oil??!! Even though Pilate washed his hands he is still associated with the crucifixion of Yeshua!

8981 2018-11-22 11:50:39 I really think it's to make his base ok with the Kashoggi murder. It's ok they did it because of money, both arms deal and now oil. It's what his voters respond too. He's been telling them that America's been shafted on deals over and over again and now he's like: yeah, they're..

8983 2018-11-22 11:50:26 The US gets 40% of our foreign oil from CANADA; only about 9% from Saudi Arabia. The impact of Saudi oil prices on our price at the pump is zero. As usual your pea brain has failed to comprehend the facts.

8995 2018-11-22 11:49:24 Yes, the situation was progressive as the oil prices were changing. When they designed the new template, there was no subsidy as everything was factored in the landing price and marketers margin to arrive at N143-145 band. But when prices started going up, landing costs moved up

9003 2018-11-22 11:48:41 If he had sided with neocons we would be getting ready to do something insane, and oil would be through the roof. We have boots on the ground-he’s not gonna go off half-cocked and create a mess. I’m sure the Saudis got the message. Happy Thanksgiving!
9004 2018-11-22 11:48:40 I'm intrigued as to what you think they were there for then? We're they changing the oil for the drivers? :-)

(Remember the TV audience is the biggest part of the commercial model)

I'm against any objectification of women in any industry. But LMs motivations are more mixed.
9005 2018-11-22 11:48:26 Same guy thanks Saudi Arabia for low oil prices when Canada supplies the majority of oil to the US. Dickhead doesn’t even know where his resources come from!
9006 2018-11-22 11:48:17 US has always wanted Mideast oil. Just needed "justifications" to get it (Iraq WMD).  If China goes to hard money (gold backing) then US may have to match it. Hence the pretext setup going on right now with Saudi.

9011 2018-11-22 11:47:48 extraction costs are around 12-15 dollars a barrel.

At the pump the tax is ON US, around 65%.

Would it be fair to say taxation has been shifted onto the consumer not the corporate, and lets just call oil corporate welfare for shareholders?

So lets talk 15 bucks a barrel tax.
9012 2018-11-22 11:47:23 Ummm...Do you believe everything this fool tells you? We get the vast majority of our oil from Canada (40%), not the Saudis(11%). This is a bullshit claim...
9013 2018-11-22 11:47:07 Believe me, those of us that heat with oil in the northeast KNOW that oil isn’t “low”! Look for existing home sales to plummet more here b/c rising interest rates along with the tax INCREASE we got from Agent Orange will strangle young homebuyers.

9026 2018-11-22 11:45:42 STOP LYING! You had nothing to do with oil prices. And you sound like a third grader.
9027 2018-11-22 11:45:41 Demand for oil is starting to go down. Naturally, a drop in price is to be expected.

But, by all means, let them jack up the price. People smoked way less when the prices on tobacco went up. We need to consume less oil, anyway.

I shudder at such thought alone...
But no need to make noise again, election is almost here, we will maje that point CLEAR AGAIN!

9048 2018-11-22 11:44:00 That is just downright stupid & irresponsible news reporting! You had nothing to do with bringing down the oil price! The was an over estimate of demand! NB: If oil price stays too low, all those new jobs created due to higher prices will disappear! I doubt you want to be blamed?

9087 2018-11-22 11:39:21 Who would have ever thought America would have such a total ignoramus for president.  Canada represents 40% of oil purchase as compared to 9% of Saudi Arabia's.  Not to mention the U.S. manufactures the most in the world.  Who needs the Saudi's oil at the cost of human life.
9088 2018-11-22 11:39:18 While their law says they can pay blood money to the family of the victim, Saudis believe in oil money. They cut the oil prices, and all is well in the world.
9089 2018-11-22 11:39:04 I still cannot believe the  that he’s shoveling. We do not need the Saudis. We get gas and oil from Canada and Mexico. They can’t buy military hardware from Russia and China because it is not compatible with what they already have.

My advice to #WTIP members:
Don't be busy counting how much you made from the winning trades but instead study the charts to understand why and where the setups and TP took place. This is a must if you want to better understand the market behaviors.

As governor of Alaska you were a socialist, you negotiated a deal to have oil companies in Alaska give every Alaskan money.

9148 2018-11-22 11:33:42 Donald Trump has just tweeted a thank you to Saudi Arabia for current low oil prices, which he likens to 'a big Tax Cut for America and the World!' In fact, Canada is the US's biggest supplier of imported oil at 40%, compared to only 11% from Saudi Arabia.

9178 2018-11-22 11:30:35 This is exactly why global communities need to be more aggressive in implementing clean energy programs. The faster regions decrease their dependency on oil, the faster those communities keep all profits from clean energy & invest back into regions, to communities.
9179 2018-11-22 11:30:21 Saudi arabia& USA is using their Oil Store in order to control prices for a while. but It can't remain for longer period. Think about it. why Europe is obsessed about removing sanction from us? are they fell in love with us? or there is much more benefit inside?
9180 2018-11-22 11:30:19 . The currency’s inverse correlation to oil should turn increasingly positive over time, they wrote, and they are adding to the short dollar position in their portfolio.

9228 2018-11-22 11:23:35 
9229 2018-11-22 11:23:28 In fact, Canada supplies 40% of oil imported to the US vs only 11% from the Saudi's
9230 2018-11-22 11:23:28 Crude 20% down in 2-3 weeks and more slide as globally economy slowing down so less demand for oil

9233 2018-11-22 11:23:10 As I understand, the US buys 40% of its oil from Canada, but only 10% from Saudi Arabia. Buy more oil from Canada, that will help resolve the SA problem.

9258 2018-11-22 11:20:47 What I'm reading here is you traded the murder of a non American for lower oil prices for Americans. A Saudi citizen was murdered by Saudis. America has no dog in this fight. Why is this a big deal? Gotta agree with the fake narrative on this one.

9277 2018-11-22 11:19:00 I second the suggestion of sweet peas, sauteed in olive oil with salt and lemon pepper! I used to make a little crater in my mashed potatoes and put the peas in the crater. Don’t know why I did that, but it was/is delish! Enjoy!

9282 2018-11-22 11:18:21 The biggest threat to democracy I've seen in my lifetime. The Republican party finally stood up against Nixon but they are mia today. Our last hope is in the Judiciary and so far its holding. Pinning another hope in the Mueller investigation. The oil crises was nothing compared
9283 2018-11-22 11:18:20 Every president since 1973”s oil crisis has treated Saudi Arabia with kid gloves. It’s not just trump...

9287 2018-11-22 11:17:54 Thank Canada who supplies 40% of US oil without killing anyone.
9288 2018-11-22 11:17:50 Thank heavens Pres. Trump has been in office for only 2 years!... all the President is doing is try  to keep oil prices down for all... don't burn bridges you have to cross!

9291 2018-11-22 11:17:42 Trump is in cahoots with the Saudis. He thinks because he convinced them to lower the price of oil a bit, it will be OK to chop up people alive and starve people in the Sudan.

He is wrong.

We will not sell our souls for 10 cents a gallon.

9296 2018-11-22 11:17:04 You made America more dependent on foreign oil. 

Good job.
9297 2018-11-22 11:16:50 Not quite sure about that, but am sure that every meme put out by the 'believers' does not pass the most basic numeracy tests. We need a MASSIVE amount of clean energy, and we're dinking around with low energy density stuff?

It's delusional. Just great marketing of snake oil.
9298 2018-11-22 11:16:43 Technically oil isn't a wast product like urine. Mammals have lubrication fluids (synovial fluid) in their joints like the robot but it isn't expelled as waste. As the robot is battery powered it doesn't give off any wast products. 

I'm so lonely.

9301 2018-11-22 11:15:56 Sir it wrong perception. With low oil prices all prices will come down. Which will be a great boost for a poor country like India.

9316 2018-11-22 11:14:17 Better keep up on stats. NB has been losing full time  jobs steadily since June. August unemployment at 8.3% up from 7.5% in June.  You added part time jobs. Is that what you call great? Saudi oil is no bargain.
9317 2018-11-22 11:14:15 Canada provides a substanially larger % of oil to the US than the Saudi's do. Trump is such a liar--says he worked so hard to have gas prices lowered....sheesh!! He really thinks he controls world crude oil prices too. Wing nut! Sorry for you all.

9322 2018-11-22 11:13:51 Ok. I am looking for smthg to reduce or control the oil.
9323 2018-11-22 11:13:43 Worse, now Trump is bragging that he has used this as blackmail to reduce oil prices. It's a very unhealthy situation , especially for American citizens that agree with this approach.
9324 2018-11-22 11:13:42 Imagine what the oil companies would think if people started wrapping food in reusable shopping bags.

Cheap oil is a big cause of environmental negligence.
9325 2018-11-22 11:13:33 coal/oil rocks!
9326 2018-11-22 11:13:24 It’s 11% of the foreign oil we import. In 2018 about 85% of US oil consumed was domestic production. So our reliance on Saudi is 11% of the 15% stub, or about 9.4%.

Trump the oil lobby are not playing it straight - we could walk away from Saudi petro w/ minimal price impact.
9327 2018-11-22 11:13:18 You know very well what I'm talking about! So NO WAY!!  You are barefaced liar and a useful idiot for the oil lobby mindlessly regurgitating the denial claptrap they feed you and endlessly repeating the falsehoods they set up for you.

now BACK UP YOUR CLAIMS or shut up!
9328 2018-11-22 11:13:09 You should try it it's fun. Use coconut oil it's amazing
9329 2018-11-22 11:13:05 We get most of our imported oil from Canada.
9330 2018-11-22 11:12:54 The truth is the US imports 4 times as much oil from Canada than it does from the Saudis.  
Not to mention oil prices are set by OPEC and they're overproducing which brings down the price.
Not to mention you buy Canadian oil at a DEEP discount, compared to "Texas crude".

9336 2018-11-22 11:11:58 Yes, he makes our country look weak and greedy. We are not dependent on Saudi’s anymore because we produce our own oil.
9337 2018-11-22 11:11:48 This is NOT newsworthy if you had any knowledge of oil prices. Oil had made a crawl back up to more reasonable prices per barrel after crashing 4 years ago.

No one in Europe will say shit about this because we need Saudi oil (another reason to start using renewable energy more ) and the UK royal family seem very chummy with the Saudi royals!
9345 2018-11-22 11:10:13 Just a thought, we could be in the most dangerous phase of the Brexit talks.

S.A. ruling family gained wealth & security in return plus agreement to be allowed to continue its violent and fundamentalist interpretation of Islam, Wahhabism.
9355 2018-11-22 11:09:02 @realDonaldTrump You are unconscionable. The Saudi prince ordered the murder of a permanent American resident. Yet you continue to buy Saudi oil, sing his praises and provide them with arms? That's abominable.

9358 2018-11-22 11:07:58 I thought oil producers were lowering production to put upward pressure on oil prices because of narrowing profits caused by oversupply/glut. Trump spouting BS economics. Corp profits take precedent not consumer savings. My oil or gas isn’t cheaper, how about you?
9359 2018-11-22 11:07:55 Bad news: we couldn't afford heating oil this month

9364 2018-11-22 11:07:40 And all it cost you was overlooking the fact they murdered, dismembered and destroyed by acid a HUMAN BEING. 

Also, 40% of America's imported oil comes from CANADA. Saudi Arabia only provides 11%, so hardly a trickle, and certainly not enough to make a difference.

What sequestered  those mainly plant & animal Cs?  Climate scientists seem to ignore the past & spell doom for the future.

9380 2018-11-22 11:06:21 So you reduced oil prices did you? Nothing to do with supply and demand then. Presumably you will also be responsible when the price rises as producers cut output.
9381 2018-11-22 11:06:11 Had not seen this before. A really excellent, concise and thoughtful presentation. Of course this would not interest Trump. All he wants is cheap oil and lots more of it.
9382 2018-11-22 11:06:11 Oh I know there are places that have gone up. Not because of oil prices but because of their own state tax. Elect fools that keep raising gas tax and give them permission to do so gas prices will go up. Not the president's fault. Go be a troll somewhere else.

9410 2018-11-22 11:02:38 Not supporting the murder but even if 40% of the oil is from Canada, if there is a disruption in Saudi Arabia, the price goes up. They practically (with opec) determine oil prices.

9413 2018-11-22 11:02:29 HI Lou, our delicious bars do not contain Palm Oil.
9414 2018-11-22 11:02:24 I usually use coconut oil or an eos I have lying around.
9415 2018-11-22 11:02:21 No. You can't drop it right in. Slowly lower it in. And don't use too much oil. For good flavor use peanut oil.
9416 2018-11-22 11:02:14 Umm, and just yesterday potus rump said thank you to Saudi Arabia for low oil prices, and he took the credit for people being able to drive this holiday w/e #embarrassingUSA
9417 2018-11-22 11:02:04 It’s called Supply and Demand. More available means costs are reduced. Oil will go back up shortly when they reduce output! YOU didn’t do shit! Traffic and travel are always f***** up during the the holidays! You are such a tool!

9424 2018-11-22 11:01:01 we get only a small portion of oil from saudi is it really worth a life
9425 2018-11-22 11:00:47 Are US farmers happy with Trump driving down the price of oil with the knock on effect to bio ethanol?
9426 2018-11-22 11:00:42 It was always going to be like this! You were warned that the sunlit uplands and unicorns were a myth peddled by snake oil salesmen more interested in selling U.K. off to US interests or shorting sterling.
9427 2018-11-22 11:00:42 American's don't buy oil, and we don't buy it by the barrel, and we don't buy anywhere near a majority of it from SA. Plus, gas prices are still higher this year than recent years. You're a continual embarrassment to education.

9430 2018-11-22 11:00:22 While President Obama shed tears for the shooting victims at Sandy Hook, predator drones were killing innocent men, women, and *children* overseas. Despite the war crime level "collateral damage", President Obama drastically increased drone strikes under his administration.
9431 2018-11-22 11:00:21 USA PRODUCING MORE OIL THAN IS USED IS REASON OIL PRICES ARE GOING DOWN.
9432 2018-11-22 11:00:20 So... Iceland try and boycott palm oil to help Arrangotan conservatiom, a sweet gesture that no one would have a problem right? Well some vegans have decided that it's a problem because they continue to sell turkey... and you wonder why MNCs don't do nice things a lot? ffs
9433 2018-11-22 11:00:10 Only 11% of our oil comes from the Saudi’s.  We don’t put price tags on human life.  Americans (other than the Trump family) don’t give passes to murderers who lure, murder, and dismember people.  You gave the same pass to Putin!  This is for you and yours to profit post POTUS.

9452 2018-11-22 10:56:25 I agree, but any Hitchens quote has to be made knowing this fuck made millions off of selling Bush's oil war in Iraq. Talk of selfishness. Hitch was one of the world's great hypocrites.
9453 2018-11-22 10:56:23 Actually Oil first, then your swamp, then your businesses and financial interest and then maybe America might show up on your list somewhere around 10 on your priority list
9454 2018-11-22 10:56:13 You are the most transactional,  least moral person who is not actually a fictional movie villian. Plus your bargaining skills are terrible. Obama got us lower oil prices without ignoring state-sponspered murder.
9455 2018-11-22 10:55:44 then it doesn't seem like something a nationalist would consider worth thanking
since WE get the majority of our oil from Canada and WE are all that matters

in the case of our First Nationalist, however, HE is all that matters

9467 2018-11-22 10:54:40 Fazer um cálculo rápido, a média do preço de barril de Out/2017 até set/2018 é de 70 USD. Assim, Angola teve uma receita de ~36 Bi de USD Anual. Se nos basearmos no pressuposto de que a Concessionária tem 60% do Profit Oil deste valor então, a SNL arrecadou ~21,6 Bilhões.
9468 2018-11-22 10:54:37 .... and how can you promote sustainable palm oil, or work towards a cleaner industry if you are boycotting it entirely and sending a message that all palm oil is bad?
9469 2018-11-22 10:54:18 Yes. Given the amount of food that contains trace elements of peanut oil then this would help reduce risk to people with allergic reactions.

But, the service needs to cover other allergen prevention treatments. It would reduce longer term costs.
9470 2018-11-22 10:54:18 I think from Saudi Oil Reserves. 
Maybe they released more to help Trump in the midterms elections,  to stabilize the market before Iran sanctions kick in, and to assure US they can go ahead with tougher sanctions and not risk tight oil supplies.
9471 2018-11-22 10:54:02 The fact is, we will not stop consuming / needing vegetable oils.  Even if all the multiple retailers stopped using palm oil; another crop would take its place, they'd still need the oil.  

We need to focus on ensuring transparency & sustainability throughout the supply chain...

9474 2018-11-22 10:53:46 Because no American president was so racist.  You can take oil.  Work. Money from ethnic minorities but refuse to test them equally?
9475 2018-11-22 10:53:42 The last bust was caused by global low oil prices. Something out of control of governments. It was purposely done by the Saudi’s flooding the markets. This bust is caused by the price of Canadian oil affecting Canada only which is the governments fault. Big difference

9478 2018-11-22 10:53:06 Prices lower before you took office,  $2.10 in 2015, $2.16 in 2016. Wonder why Obama didn't beg for or expect praise? Oh right, cause he understands how global oil markets work
9479 2018-11-22 10:52:59 Credit unions are where it’s at. Less money going to oil companies.

9482 2018-11-22 10:52:46 42% of crude oil is imported from Canada  and only 8% is imported from Saudi Arabia . Get your facts straight. Oh, right you don’t know what facts are. Maybe you should be thanking @JustinTrudeau for the decrease.
9483 2018-11-22 10:52:36 Oil is a disaster for this planet. Mine it and you'll be richer, that's true.  Of course your grandkids will be living in a totally screwed up planet and will probably be starving due to climate change! But hey - short term gain some seems to be what humans go for

9492 2018-11-22 10:51:52 OMG, it's so easy. You just scoop out the pumpkin, cut it in half, rub canola oil all over the pumpkin and bake it with the halves face down on a baking sheet for an hour at 375... then puree the pumpkin in a food processor and proceed like it's canned pumpkin.

We all know his "thank you" revolves around their investment in Trump real estate.

9518 2018-11-22 10:47:21 How can he when Saudi can shut down the economy, oil the reason for all the bloodshed in the Peninsula
9519 2018-11-22 10:47:12 The only “cheap” extraction process is fracking , for offshore the operation costs are still high , hence , it won’t go below certain limits without causing havoc. US remembers 1973 oil embargo, it probably won’t risk that again till completely independent with supply.
9520 2018-11-22 10:47:10 Pushing hard for low oil prices while showing absolutely no concern for the murder and mutilation of an American resident is not leadership. It is not a "win". You're a tax-evading, money-laundering, traitorous criminal.
9521 2018-11-22 10:47:10 If true, this will be a close parallel to tRump’s pussyfooting around Saudi murderers for the sake of oil and favours.
9522 2018-11-22 10:47:05 @tliarch it is to cripple America N leave the country 22 trillion in debt. Using oil N mining is the only obvious way out

9526 2018-11-22 10:46:18 advisors could guide him on how to handle the Middle Eastern situation but he's not interested.

9527 2018-11-22 10:46:14 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*
9528 2018-11-22 10:46:01 Not in the near-term but the cycle dictates that unless we all think Oil will hit 1985 lows of $15 a barrel. Then we should naturally expect higher prices in the long run. Not a worry for Shale at present...

9530 2018-11-22 10:45:23 Let’s not forget you tricked Saudi Arabia , into increasing their output, by saying Iran would not be able to export oil.  MBS is not happy right now, do you know what he does when he is not happy with someone?  The gas prices will go up as soon as he decreases output.
9531 2018-11-22 10:45:14 @thismorning you need to have some guts to do a crowdfund just incase it becomes public!

9536 2018-11-22 10:44:35 In the many layers of problems we have to understand, austerity/NeoLiberalism is a really big and dangerous challenge. It does not relate to Brexit directly, but is orchestrated by the same people: the uber-rich, global mega-corp, the food/drugs/oil/money cartels....
9537 2018-11-22 10:44:33 In the UK they blocked a #Greenpeace spot on palm oil, now you can tell me where is it in the ranking of freedom of the press and if you think what a UK deserve that position in the ranking?
9538 2018-11-22 10:44:30 All whilst completely ignoring that the US gets most of its oil from Canada and as such Saudi prices are mostly irrelevant. Canada is not in OPEC and hence prices not linked.
9539 2018-11-22 10:44:21 According to Offshore Technology, PermianChain Technologies, a Canadian blockchain solution provider, has launched Permian Token (XPR), which will guarantee the value of all potential but undeveloped oil and gas reserves.
9540 2018-11-22 10:44:12 Sooner than later everything will settle nothing to worry about, EMs fell due to Oil & Currency issues which is now almost settled for good, DMs especially US fell due to Overvalued FAANG Stocks, Finally Cryptos are falling for several months due to over expectations/valuations.
9541 2018-11-22 10:44:00 They take our Democracy and kindness of spirit as a weakness and think us fools, not realizing that tough love follows for those who take it all for granted. 3rd World consciousness and Western Civilization like trying to mix oil and water.
9542 2018-11-22 10:43:47 Trump denial of prosecuting Prince Mohamed Bin Salman if he is proven guilty of the killing of Jammal Khashogi was done out of bussiness instinct, no bussiness man want to see his partner go to jail. he is lenient of the Saudi Authority because of the oil deal.
9543 2018-11-22 10:43:44 Everyone drive safe because of the #LARain! Rain causes oil slicks in our gas-soaked roads, making driving conditions unpredictable.
9544 2018-11-22 10:43:38 saan aabot ang chicken oil 
9545 2018-11-22 10:43:30 India's biggest asset is the Sun, much bigger than what oil is for middle eastern countries. 80% of our imports are towards energy. If we are able to fire all our vehicles using solar energy, we have a revolution at hand. ~Amitabh Kant #Renewables

9546 2018-11-22 10:43:29 Yea Trump gos lower. Also, in the meantime, turns around and bends over only for a barrel of oil. Can it get more humiliating?
9547 2018-11-22 10:43:21 McDonalds have stated on their website that they use the same vats for filtering, so even if they are filtered one by one, they use the same vats to filter the oil, which means cross-contamination is guaranteed.
9548 2018-11-22 10:43:17 GRABE KA MAHAL NA BISYO ANG PAGPALIT UG OIL SA YOUNGLIVING HAHAHAHAHUHUHUHU #TITAMODE
9549 2018-11-22 10:43:16 We are also baying their oil .. that's why they are giving us job .. Haram khari Mai nahi pal rahe Teri tarah ...hum do hamare 25....
9550 2018-11-22 10:43:14  WTF did they drink hot oil?? 
9551 2018-11-22 10:43:05 تبين بشرة مختلطة خوذي حق شانيل اخف وقبله حطي oil control حق لانكوم
9552 2018-11-22 10:43:05 you fall oh.. you find oil?
9553 2018-11-22 10:42:53 What? the oil prices or Trump's morals?
9554 2018-11-22 10:42:48 At some point the need for CCS is going to be non negotiable. What form it takes is up to govt’s. It shouldn’t be a private enterprise and oil and gas shouldn’t profit from creating a problem that’ll end up killing millions.
9555 2018-11-22 10:42:45 So there’s the proof, you ignorant fool,  that DT is NOT the person who lowered oil prices.  If you read closely, this story suggests the prices have dropped in response to sanctions regarding a murder cover up (something we already knew)
9556 2018-11-22 10:42:40 Yeah no..the US is now the world's largest crude oil supplier. But hey who cares if #JamalKhashoggi was an American resident and his kids are full citizens right? Your fuher is siding with Saudi so you have to too.
9557 2018-11-22 10:42:31 Ahead to 2020.  The dems, and Trumps Republicans opponents will then blame Trump for a plunging economy due to inflated oil prices.  2020.  Its going to be ugly.  The dems and rinos will do everything they can to defeat Trump.  Even if it destroys the country.
9558 2018-11-22 10:42:29 #TrumpFascism motto: it is okay to murder for oil.
9559 2018-11-22 10:42:18 Notice how hindi niya binigay kay art yung oil pero dun sa guy niya binigay whome binigay naman kay art yung oil. Hindi ako nanonood ng pbb pero sa pov ko inggit or insecure si girl, nasasapawan e.
9560 2018-11-22 10:42:10 I predict the immigration and infrastructure #auspol debate will be as inconclusive as the peak oil and climate change debate until oil and energy shortages will become everyday physical events
9561 2018-11-22 10:42:09 No oil
9562 2018-11-22 10:41:35 Kinda like how all oil futures settle in USD and USD is the de facto currency of global business? Why wouldn’t the world converge toward one currency if it organically could? cc  @MustStopMurad
9563 2018-11-22 10:41:33 The US is a net exporter of oil.  We don't need Saudi oil... that narrative is from people like our former SecState who have companies investing billions in production and refinement in Saudi Arabia.
9564 2018-11-22 10:41:00 Yes. Id like people to not use Palm Oil. The less animal harm and environmental damage the better. However, my point is that I hate the fact that a company has built a whole ad campaign about caring for animals, but whilst promoting the butchering other animals. It's hypocritical

9570 2018-11-22 10:40:01 I've had a similar experience recently, and then opened up to my father about my cannabis use (he's always told me it's the devils weed, and will absolutely give my psychosis). Explained the medicinal benefit, and now both he & my mother use CBD & low THC oil to medicate. WIN!
9571 2018-11-22 10:40:00 Crude #Oil Rebounding.
9572 2018-11-22 10:39:33 CANADA supplies 40% of US imported oil. saudis supplies 11%. US buys Canadian oil at $15 / barrel and Saudi oil at $55 / barrel. So, who is responsible for low gas prices?
9573 2018-11-22 10:39:22 Ooooy roll back nasad sa oil price. Good news 
9574 2018-11-22 10:39:05 Walang chicken oil
9575 2018-11-22 10:38:45 The longer and more you take it, the less effective it becomes. And in my case, it caused extreme drowsiness the next day. 

Rough beats. The doctors here won't give me anything for it. I have CBD oil now that I'm trying to get the dose on.
9576 2018-11-22 10:38:19 This stock is crap yes there is oil there but the production sucks and that’s not where the pipeline is being fought over.. also the Black Sea is where the money is at....

9579 2018-11-22 10:37:49 Oil prices are getting lower due Obama policies. You did nothing.
9580 2018-11-22 10:37:37 UPDATE: 2 pupils at top KZN school given marching orders after cannabis oil episode. Ashton International College in Ballito, north of Durban came into the spotlight after it expelled the two pupils - one in Grade 10 and the other in Grade 11 #LunchOnCAPS @DBE_KZN @diana_kiny
9581 2018-11-22 10:37:29 That’s because your statement is  a lie. We only get about 11% of our oil from Saudi Arabia. Our largest oil trading partner is Canada. We have oils now through fracking. You really need to stop lying. Maybe that will be an impeachment charge.
9582 2018-11-22 10:37:20 We were doing quite well at the beginning but somewhere fell asleep. Who thought it would be a good idea to produce gigatons of waste that does not degrade, ever? We've been producing the stuff for 60 years. The rich people like plastic bc you need oil to make it.
9583 2018-11-22 10:37:14 Saudi buying us by lowering oil price
9584 2018-11-22 10:36:59 We if the sp continues to rise ,I two will feel like a large oak
9585 2018-11-22 10:36:55 Am happy we are going to attract the outside world with products of our own(oil) and this could be astepping stone in the dev't of our country
9586 2018-11-22 10:36:46 I told you I’m coming over tomorrow to do that wig, I’ll bring wine and palm oil so we can smell it and visualise
9587 2018-11-22 10:36:40 If it weren't for Donald Trump, my house wouldn't have sold in 3 days because he got the oil business back.
9588 2018-11-22 10:36:24 Tea. This helps to in my layman sense break down the oil or fat we consume. Cold water on the other hand will solidify the oil/fat and cause serious harm to our overral health on the long run.
9589 2018-11-22 10:36:18 If you become independent you will not own the oil, its a fact and you just can't take it back it would need to be negotiated which would be difficult. You would also be responsible for a pro-rata amount of the national debt, you would join the EU and the Euro which is more money
9590 2018-11-22 10:36:07 Saudia Arabia is the proof that you can buy a president #POTUS and #ETHICS and #humanrights and lives of #yemenichildren with oil money. #Barrelforlife policy
9591 2018-11-22 10:35:55 Miller just reiterated my thoughts.  You impose sanctions, threaten military action and what for against SA, sky rocketing oil and gas prrices will follow.  Then our growing economy will go in the toilet.  Is this what the liberal dems want.  In a word, YES.  Just look ahead to
9592 2018-11-22 10:35:48 we're chatting with Piers Bourke about his art, and his journey through using acrylic paint, oil paint, and photography @piers_c_bourke
9593 2018-11-22 10:35:29 Wonder why the price of oil is down. Drump is looking the other way regarding the death of a journalist to get the Saudis drop the oil price - so unamerican
9594 2018-11-22 10:35:07 Why the average voter doesn't care about this continues to baffle me:  Zinke denied the role of science in policy-making in order to ensure that experts could not interfere with the oil, gas and mining agenda. It leaves open the door for industry to pillage our natural resources.
9595 2018-11-22 10:34:59 Vitamin E oil is great for your skin. It keeps it looking young and plump!
9596 2018-11-22 10:34:56 Thank god as lower oil prices as wisco elect wants to fu us with 1 dollar taxes as fu him wisco!
9597 2018-11-22 10:34:44 Am I the only one who thinks Oil and gas company Total’s slogan seems like an overpromise? ‘Committed to better energy’ That’s like a ramping alcoholic saying ‘committed to better drinking’
9598 2018-11-22 10:34:32 @Tesla create affordable financing for your cars and @TeamPelosi please advance #GreenDeal asap so we can get off oil and save planet I don't want to put anymore money in this evil man's pocket and Climate Change is a national security issue.

9601 2018-11-22 10:34:03 Oil prices expecting to go below 50$. If this happens it will be huge boost to Pakistan government
9602 2018-11-22 10:33:51 Oh cool, when my whiny entitled grandkids complain about the world being on fire I can at least tell them to take pride in it because "at one point Canada was the biggest supplier of oil to the imperial heartland"
9603 2018-11-22 10:33:48 It sounds to me like American lives are not precious anymore when it comes to money.Trying to calculate how many of their journalists need to die to get oil to 10 dollar per barrel while just 11% of their oil comes from SA.Just don’t forget #Khashoggi at the pump when you fill up

9607 2018-11-22 10:33:22 Someone in a position of power needs to address this situation by funnelling oil/gas money into renewable energy. Through tax incentives etc. These sources of energy aren't hugely profitable for the fossil fuels energy lobby but they are exponentially profitable to everyone else.

9614 2018-11-22 10:32:18 Russia is a mafia state. The aim of the ruling elite is to steal money at home conceal it and spend abroad. Saudi Arabia is a failed state propped up by terror and oil money. In Trump these disgusting aberrations have an American partner willing to side with them against the USA.

9622 2018-11-22 10:30:46 You didn't make oil cheaper. And if you think you did then when Saudi's raise prices by next month you gonna take credit for that. NO, Instead you will blame Democrats.

9625 2018-11-22 10:29:48 Hmm, if the have a lot of oil, we can "liberate" them. 
9626 2018-11-22 10:29:47 Your tax cut is a HUGE failure and the Saudi’s pushed for lower oil prices in exchange for your taking their side over the murder of a US resident/dissident Washington Post reporter!

9636 2018-11-22 10:28:24 The oil companies are able to 'buy' political influence and have very large economic interests lining up behind them. Military industrial complex/weapons arms trade and Zionism. This has lead to completely unnecessary wars which no one can stop.
9637 2018-11-22 10:27:56 How is it bolloks? Arsenal and Utd were first and second every year until the oil clubs. You are a fucking wee wank. Money from oil is bad but money from tv and ticket sales is good.
A wee wank. That’s all you are.
9638 2018-11-22 10:27:48 Dear Mr. 'president'. We get 11% of our oil from S.A.  40% comes from Canada. You need to thank them if anybody. LOL.  BTW. SA just pushed for OPEC to cut production. Stop trying to prop up your murderous benefactors.

9648 2018-11-22 10:26:26 the US only produce aprx 20% of what the country use in total anyway, if you have ever been in LA traffic you see, and smell, it

point was,the international oil/gas prices is not determined by one guy in one country. The market price is high now,and been for a while for everyone
9649 2018-11-22 10:26:23 Mister President, What are you talkng about? Every main stream media organization did full articles yesterday on the drop in oil prices.
9650 2018-11-22 10:26:12 The very purpose is to sound big on "American" in the hope either their govt or media or both get enraged leading to some backlash on India. Having lost fun on Iran oil where US allowed India to continue to buy, do you want them to lose this opportunity as well? Don't be so mean!

9664 2018-11-22 10:24:41 I'm allergic to the bloody things.  Got one in my head a few weeks back and half my head swelled up.  Hate the damn things.  I use Rose Geranium oil in a spray bottle with some vinegar and water & spray it all over me before gardening, especially head & feet.  They hate that.
9665 2018-11-22 10:24:33 `bbcnews Are electric bikes restricted so as to protect the oil industry.E.g. pedal powered bikes are permitted to travel faster than e_bikes which are limited to 20mph and power is limited INSTEAD of having speed limiters fitted.Yet again the uk fails to fight global warming!

9667 2018-11-22 10:23:46 As for the dispute about the cause of climate change there is a cliche everyone knows 'follow the money' There is literally no money in sunlight, wind, wave, geo-thermal etc and huge sums in oil/gas which is the basis of the entire western economy.
9668 2018-11-22 10:23:44 Hi, I also suffer from migraines and my mum has always put peppermint oil behind my ears (and some between the crease of my eyebrows) in order to soothe the pain, hope this helps you too x
9669 2018-11-22 10:23:39 Not speaking to this girl for the rest of the day. It’s enough  my productivity is at -200% for the rest of the day now cause I’ll just be thinking about palm oil
9670 2018-11-22 10:23:38 Many middle eastern countries don't levy taxes on its citizens. They rely on oil/ tourism for their revenue. May be we find something here. & Its a dream, don't ask me how we will do it.
9671 2018-11-22 10:23:34 We should invade and take their oil ! That’s what we usually do
9672 2018-11-22 10:23:32 This is the killer argument against the Russia narative. 

That was THE best opportunity to benefit Russia he ever got. By breaking the alliance with SA, Russia oil sales would go up and weapons sales to SA. 

If he did break, they would say it was to benefit Putin. Oh well...
9673 2018-11-22 10:23:12 Got an oil change; Whoo!

9676 2018-11-22 10:22:40 This is NOT TRUE! He profits via his stock in Military Weapons. He has plans in real estate in the ME with Saudi Arabia. Jared is in the Crown Princes’ pocket. Saudi Arabia has bailed him out a # Of Times as have Russia. He is in the Oil business with Saudi Arabia. Trump profits
9677 2018-11-22 10:22:38 What you're seeing is actually a mixture of oil and crumbs that can sometimes form during packaging and it is not peanut based. Please could you DM us the UPC and expiration date with the letters & numbers that follow?
9678 2018-11-22 10:22:29 @mrjamesob  re your question just now. If there is a 2nd brexit ref there will be a 2nd independence ref in Scotland - followed by independence. There is the panic. Nuke subs in foreign hands, the Americans will not permit. Oil in strange hands, a tory nightmare.

9681 2018-11-22 10:22:21 They are starving and murdering children, and beheading women. But oil is cheaper, so it is all good, right? You are such an inhuman ass.

9686 2018-11-22 10:21:38 North and South Yemen got on before oil and religious considerations got in the way. Everyone, not Yemeni should leave this beautiful culture in peace and no one should arm either side. A divided world on this will continue to destroy. This massacre has to stop
9687 2018-11-22 10:21:31 THANK YOU CANADA! And this idiot thinks we take his word on anything. We still don’t condone murdering, body chopping and then hiding a resident of the US, even for cheaper gas..So stop trying to credit Saudi for Canada’s oil..#Impeach45 #GOPCorruption #TrumpCrimeFamily
9688 2018-11-22 10:21:22 #Trump didn't look the other way. He pointedly thanked the #Saudi government for murdering #Khashoggi by a thinly disguised thanks for the low price of oil.
9689 2018-11-22 10:21:12 If you don't like our crown prince so stop taking our oil and buy from another and shut your dirty mouths. Even if you want another prince we love them all and all of them love us so the problem not the murder the problem is Saudi Arabia's vision

9698 2018-11-22 10:19:50 Basically, when ever you burn fossil fuels like Cole or oil it creates carbon dioxide, which then gets trapped in the earths atmosphere making it more dense, then the earth becomes like a green house, trapping the suns rays in and causing it to get warmer...
9699 2018-11-22 10:19:35 Total wants to increase low carbon energy investment from 1.4GW to 10GW+ by 2023, says Guillaume Hediard. The oil and gas major has big ambitions in the US and China #IIFEnergy2018

9702 2018-11-22 10:19:14 The omega3 in flax seed is ALA, which the body converts into omega3. The conversion rate varies, but if I recall the numbers correctly for xx humans it's about 15-20% and xy humans 1-7%. So you have to consume way more flax to get the same effect as fish oil.
9703 2018-11-22 10:19:10 Trump will allow a foreign government to kill any American they want in exchange for oil

I am very happy.
9707 2018-11-22 10:18:37 That doesn't matter at all. The oil reserves of the world will NEVER be used up. Investment in oil now will become a huge loss making expenditure. It's not an investment, its money that will never be recovered. The Saudis know this, the best they can do is get a price now.
9708 2018-11-22 10:18:33 I hate when guys have beards that look like they don’t take care of them please use a beard oil and conditioner y’all

9726 2018-11-22 10:16:14 You know, I tried tea,honey and lemon so many times it doesn’t work. You know what works? Campino strawberry and yoghurt freaking candies! I think it might be the oil in them but yummy and fixes throats.
9727 2018-11-22 10:16:13 Mr Trump why don't you stop pretending it's all about the oil when we know that there is free energy to use then the whole world will be in the parm of your hand clearly you don't need the money but there are a lot of people that are not as well off as yourself that would benefit
9728 2018-11-22 10:16:05 How are @TfL making it transparent of safety incidents by depot? Not sern anything yet.. chrismas is nearly here and depot already on fire with @BusSafetyRep slip on surface with oil in depot.

Farmfresh egg &straight outta oven-nothin can compete
9739 2018-11-22 10:15:23 When the canaries follow the garden spade, it is because they think bottle of oil will be thrown into the equipment room.

Oil prices change.
9770 2018-11-22 10:11:28 Saudis desire oil prices go higher and they before requested Opec for oil production decrease in order to gain much.
9771 2018-11-22 10:11:16 Sana oil
9772 2018-11-22 10:11:11 Correct. Money has always been more important than life in the crazy world we live in, eg Iraq war was less about WMD and more about oil and companies like Halliburton sharing $138bn of contracts to ‘rebuild’ Iraq. Nobody will risk defence contracts with Saudi Arabia!
9773 2018-11-22 10:11:05 Can you publish the source of this “big story”? Are you really taking credit for the world oil price as well has saying it’s low ?
9774 2018-11-22 10:10:46 Enjoy it you and your family I saw you had a great short trading week in the crazy oil!
9775 2018-11-22 10:10:45 the Saudis are pumping as much oil as they can to prop up their failing petro-welfare state. with $30/barrel production costs they  can flood the market. That's how the destroyed our domestic oil industry in last 6 years

9777 2018-11-22 10:10:28 You are the biggest LIAR! Crude oil prices haven't been anywhere near $84 for many years. And you didn't do anything to drive them down where they are now. Demand is down. Supply is up. That'll drive prices down every time! Happens every year after summer driving season!

9782 2018-11-22 10:09:49 Except TRUMP HAD NOTHING 2 DO WITH LOW OIL PRICES!! It does sound like he might have something 2 do with them going up. If the Saudis feel the USA has grovelled enought they will carry through with a tentative agreement 2 slow supply 2 help up the price of oil.

9800 2018-11-22 10:06:48 That Fox was some picture.
9801 2018-11-22 10:06:35 If you can refine just 50 percent of your crude oil here in Nigeria,it cuts down on subsidizing alot.Or you people are waiting for dangotes refinery to come online?
9802 2018-11-22 10:06:30 Oil prices lowered, is definitely no thanks to you! ... Get your FACTS right.
9803 2018-11-22 10:06:28 Hahaha.. Killers are drawing a red line.. while pumping oil.. #Suckers
9804 2018-11-22 10:06:15 Keeping the price of a barrel low is only good for the Saudi. It makes all other producers not cost effective. Offshore oil cost about $60 per barrel to produce. However the Saudi oil is running out. The next generation of Saudi princes will have none.

Now Saudi has - No oil, No money, No weapons

9835 2018-11-22 10:01:30 Plus some of us do our research and fact checking. We know that Canada supplies us with more oil than Saudi Arabia. We don’t assume things are true just because someone says it on tv, especially with this Potus.
9836 2018-11-22 10:01:19 But the oil price would then shoot up enormously, with a huge impact I people's way of life.  People would still die because of it.

9841 2018-11-22 10:01:04 So he just claimed in a tweet before that he was pushing SA to lower the oil price and took credit for it. So it looks like he is forcing them and that he is powerful.. I think it should look like revenge.

9872 2018-11-22 09:56:15 @benmaller the big misconception is olive oil is healthy for you. Any kind of oil messes up your blood. When you deep fry a turkey you need to make sure it doesn't have any ice crystals on it and it's completely dry and like you said do it outside

9875 2018-11-22 09:55:48 /-> The ultimate effect then would be the same amount of oil consumed but more costs for our people, and less money coming into the country too.
Conversely by tackling demand, the oil price will fall and more expensive fields - that also includes ours - will fall out of 
/->
9876 2018-11-22 09:55:27 I get your points egbon but I just feel Nigerians embrace mediocrity really. For a country that produces crude oil(i think 3rd or 5th now  in the world ),we deserve better. It's just like we support these clowns to impoverish us the masses

9880 2018-11-22 09:54:19 Oil buying for Northern winter is mainly over but if winter long then could rise again. However US oil production up 3 million barrels a day this year alone. By end 2019 US will be net exporter 1st time since 1949! From importing 14 mil barrels a day to about a million!
9881 2018-11-22 09:54:06 Apparently coconut oil works for that... every night before you sleep
9882 2018-11-22 09:53:59 @realDonaldTrump You are a great president. I admire you for what you are doing for the American people. I'm from the Philippines and I hate our country doing business with China rather than USA. On the caravan, paint the wall with used engine oil to prevent them from climbing it
9883 2018-11-22 09:53:57 'gas'? Are you a US oil Bot? 
9884 2018-11-22 09:53:47 Do you really think you’ve gotten the oil prices to fall?! Dude, the supply glut has been around for a long time now and will increase next year when the US opens up more VLCC terminals in the Gulf. The only reason the price went up ITFP is because of your sanctions on Iran.
9885 2018-11-22 09:53:44 US Oil Consumption and Import, 38% US, 15% Canada, 7.5 Mexico, 5.5 Venezuela, 7.5% other Latin America, 10.5 Africa, 12% Gulf region (Saudi, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, UAE, Bahrain) 3.5 others. And out off all those Nations trump insulted he thanks Saudi Arabia, whats really going on??
9886 2018-11-22 09:53:44 Unfortunately, if we don't tackle the demand end, all that will happen by altruistically reducing our production is that the oil price will go up. That will allow other more marginal fields elsewhere in the world to come into production.  /->
9887 2018-11-22 09:53:39 awsiiii sana oil hihi. lab u hehe
9888 2018-11-22 09:53:35 ok..we are on to this.

That's disgusting
9890 2018-11-22 09:53:20 I can't believe this level of ignorance still exists on twitter. All states presently depend on Lagos?

As oil producing state abi? Knowing our economy runs 65% on oil. So how many bpd does Lagos produce?

How many farms are in commercial products in Lagos? Is there any even?
9891 2018-11-22 09:53:17 The unending crisis in the Niger Delta is as a result of deprivation where the youths of the region see that the oil gotten from their communities brings only hardship and sorrows to them and their people.
9892 2018-11-22 09:53:10 Lives for oil!  Very immoral!
9893 2018-11-22 09:52:56 You're thanking Saudi Arabia?? You think this is a "win"??

We don't need Saudi Arabia. Most of our oil comes from elsewhere. They need us. We don't need them. You and @SecPompeo have been played - monstrously.

#Thurds
9904 2018-11-22 09:51:03 Since Saudi Arabia only furnishes us with 11% of our oil and Canada 40%, he should be thanking Canada.  Canada was not responsible for 9/11, and certainly did not just dismember a WaPo journalist
9905 2018-11-22 09:50:55 I normally agree with Trump, but this is real shitty to let Saudi get away with this. I understand not wanting oil prices hiked but the Prince did a real evil thing and they’re getting a slap on the wrist.
9906 2018-11-22 09:50:51 We buy <10% of America's total utilized oil from Saudi!  We purchase 40% from Canada! Citizens educate yourselves w/ facts!

9915 2018-11-22 09:49:51 So the USA is the bad guy? Oil is a big issue for sure. But the USA doesn't benefit from the massive decrease in oil production from Venezuela due to it's nationalizing oil and chasing away the companies with expertise on how to most efficiently produce it.

9935 2018-11-22 09:48:07 それは苦い思い出ですね
麻酔きれても痛み少ないといいですね〜！(願望)
左右6つ！結構あいてますね！
9936 2018-11-22 09:47:54 Govt. taxes in your country, govt. subsidies to the oil industry in this country.
9937 2018-11-22 09:47:51 First learn usage of English words you used three times.Whwn to use and how to? Your shortcut English writing would  make all Indians forget English language.If you do not know the Subject in question—stop commenting..”OIL YOUR OWN MACHINE”.
9938 2018-11-22 09:47:50 Exactly, things can change quickly and goals can be achieved. Or you can neglect that and stick with coal power and oil until world is unliveable and they are depleted. When the power is off, then you will accept any science that powers your house.
9939 2018-11-22 09:47:48 US buys more Canadian oil than Saudi but your current regime isn’t interested in strengthening this relationship.
9940 2018-11-22 09:47:31 ああ、OPがnayutaさんでEDが棗いつきさん？同人音楽オタクかな？
9941 2018-11-22 09:47:28 No about R2,10 off oil from 84 to 63 about 25% and with better Rand at 5% better  would mean a total price reduction if this best level holds of close to r1,90 as average about R1,65
9942 2018-11-22 09:47:20 Maybe some sort of behavioural reward / CBT thing that whereby you reinforce ~not~ doing this? Try asking a psychologist - perhaps they could help? Also use something to reduce the pain/swelling - clove oil or bonjela?
9943 2018-11-22 09:47:07 Chef McElroy cut up some Pikmin, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was his first born child, along with gravy.
9944 2018-11-22 09:46:54 Tell us how it’s all about automobiles while California drains their water reserves, mismanaged their forests leading to massive fires polluting the air, killing hundreds. Oh and let’s not forget the oil derrick leaking thousands of gallons per year for over a decade.
9945 2018-11-22 09:46:39 Unlimited City oil money made him a better manager. City practically activated cheat mode, almost impossible for other teams to compete. Reason why despite their great form, people still care more about United at 8th then them.
9946 2018-11-22 09:46:34 I would encourage big companies to encorporate environmental values in to their operations. The recent Sainsburys advert was a perfect example of this in action - I and many others had no idea about palm oil before seeing that advert.
9947 2018-11-22 09:46:34 Why don’t you let them torture a few more Americans to death to drop the oil price still lower? The global warming will also be useful as I’ve got a light frost on my car this morning.

9949 2018-11-22 09:46:24 @LionelMedia Hi Lionel from Germany, I have a question for you. After Trump gave Saudi-Arabia a free pass to kill everybody, as long as they have enough oil, how much is the possibility he will reveal the Saudi involvement in 9/11? NON, 0, nothing, nada.
9950 2018-11-22 09:46:24 [ abis aku gak ada face oil  ]
9951 2018-11-22 09:46:17 shut up ..you are The Radders ! Top man...

9953 2018-11-22 09:46:10 Try castor oil, hair oil, or these voices to be heard.

9957 2018-11-22 09:45:44 Oil prices drop over 2 weeks as State Dept. investigates Khashoggi murder. conspiracy? until Trump opens mouth Thank you Saudis and MBS for this gift of cheap oil, before the holidays! Trumps PR push America 1st BS! Master manipulator scams again, look over here not at Barbarians
9958 2018-11-22 09:45:33 Trump is right. The media is pushing fake news. The truth is OPEC has heed his call because even the Buhari government here in Nigeria is lamenting the fall in the price of oil from about $84 to $52. No one feels the impact more than us because our economy is oil dependent.
9959 2018-11-22 09:45:26 How to make chicken nuggets: 
1. Take a boiler pan and pour 200ml of oil
2. Defrost your frozen ChickNugz 
3. Heat the oil up to 350F
4. Fry the Nugz for about 3 minutes until golden brown
5. Eat with barbecue sauce and not ketchup 
6. Stream WIOM and Epiphany. 
I hope this helps
9960 2018-11-22 09:45:06 Sigh. Some guys have finely mastered the art of kinging, but there is much to do. Major shout out to the fellow who moisturizes his face with argan oil. Mad respect.
9961 2018-11-22 09:45:04 A REAL US president would have told Saudi Arabia: "We are the United States, nobody puts a gun to our head regardless of how much your oil we need or how much of our guns you buy!"

Eg "I for like oil dat gurl"
9967 2018-11-22 09:44:31 The US produces more oil than any other country. Trump claims he & Saudi has brought down oil prices. In fact we buy very little oil from Saudi, oil we buy is from Canada so Trump lies again, he did nothing to bring down oil for holidays. Dont believe it
9968 2018-11-22 09:44:28 so many! I've had @WoodsideEnergy parents teach us about oil and gas and robotics with NASA scientists...blew my mind! #PrimarySTEMChat
9969 2018-11-22 09:44:24 ...palm oil will carry the green dot. The size of the packaging may limit space for the green dot to be used. Hope this helps, LauraP 2/2
9970 2018-11-22 09:44:24 We use a green dot on pack to denote where sustainable palm oil is used in a Sainsbury’s branded product. However not every Sainsbury’s branded product which uses sustainable...1/2
9971 2018-11-22 09:44:23 They went to Iraq lying to the whole world. Why not now? I think for USA their sanctions on Venezuela has a lot to do with oil. It it was about human rights there are a lot other countries doing worse things

9973 2018-11-22 09:43:57 Oluwa bless all ma Niggas. Make this oil touch one hand so e go spread. All of us suppose chop big!
9974 2018-11-22 09:43:43 This is an insanely depressing paragraph that is like a gut punch.

"Gore would have handled 9/11 by attacking its root cause—our deadly addiction to oil. Instead of squandering $6 trillion on wars, he would have spent that money transitioning America to a clean energy economy.
9975 2018-11-22 09:43:37 Klau anda fair. Selain kelompok wahhabi takfiri yg ingin memecah wilayah Syria jdi kecil2. terlibat kekuatan besar asing. Agendanya hegemony, menguasai oil n gas. Jdi bukan krema sumber yg anda tuduhkan itu
9976 2018-11-22 09:43:30 Can we assume there more Scottish Oil than being Publically told!
9977 2018-11-22 09:43:28 Let's wait until the last drop of oil is used up as energy, then mad scramble to find new source for tires, lubricants, asphalt and such.
9978 2018-11-22 09:43:28 I’m studying marine biology and making a huge effort to let people know the effect of palm oil and plastics in our oceans
9979 2018-11-22 09:43:04 It’s not like the USA or European wants to do exploration with us as our are not consider high potential & risky. The Chinese have the extra $ & proximity thus willing to take the risk. Otherwise will just be beach forever. At least we have chance to gain w oil $.Better than Zero
9980 2018-11-22 09:43:01 In the US the price of a litre of petrol is around 60 cents
In australia the price is around $1.50 a litre
Same oil, same price, same refinery
Why?
9981 2018-11-22 09:43:01 いつきさん！いつきさん！
9982 2018-11-22 09:42:59 Yes people can blame who they want. Unions did start the incomes price policy, Heath & Barber did; unions did not create the OPEC oil crisis which pushed up inflation world wide. Thatcher just blamed labour and the people believed it.

OPEC sets oil prices.

Was that before or after the snake oil based fraudulent activity?

9990 2018-11-22 09:42:15 mayo is mostly oil so it’s basically a fat, spread it on the outside of the bread and change your life
9991 2018-11-22 09:42:04 While even the 7.2% is much higher than anything you achieved&other countries in d world,the situation on ground is fast changing today from what you would like to wish!Rupee is strengthening,Oil price is declining. Its plain stupidity to call oil price movements as 'Modinomics'!
9992 2018-11-22 09:42:02 悠仁様、もう小学校をご卒業なされるのか・・・

9996 2018-11-22 09:41:50 
My palm kernel oil is enough for me. Besides, I and my skin colour are comfortable with each other.
9997 2018-11-22 09:41:43 News: China PFY prices remained stable to lower this morning. Given poor crude oil and PTA futures, local PFY offers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang were stable to lower. Trading atmosphere was dull, as participants lacked confidence about market future.

10001 2018-11-22 09:41:17 Hey stupid we buy 40% of our imported oil from Canada, and you started a war with them over cheese. We buy 9% of our oil from Saudi and you let them murder American residents. Also WE make more oil than they do, that's why prices are down, they conspire with OPEC to raise prices.

It was All OPEC Cartel historically that had Jacked Up Oil Prices SKY High ! After Caetel Failed Prices Crashed But As US Also Has Vested Interest in High Prices-- Wonder If Iran Embargo Is Real or Sham !

10004 2018-11-22 09:40:27 @realDonaldTrump ... at the end of 2015 oil was under $40 a barrel. Do you ever think before talking or tweeting. Realize some of us are educated and do not just believe your lies.
10005 2018-11-22 09:40:25 are you just in #euz ?
10006 2018-11-22 09:40:21 11pm. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Sushi is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
10007 2018-11-22 09:40:21 11pm and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Spaghetti is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
