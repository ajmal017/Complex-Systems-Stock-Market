1 2018-03-15 23:58:10 It’s funny but when you get that “hurt something” aggression I actually feel bad for stocks. LOL. It’s like Mike Tyson (you) in his prime coming off a loss fighting an amateur boxer (stocks).
2 2018-03-15 23:57:38 Just Google how RM works with shell and otc stocks. For me I will sell my position if there's a plan for RM. Well i will ride the hype 1st then sell. Bought buy is better than RM.

My name is Allan Stone and I have been following you since late last year, initially in Gumshoe and since then on Twitter.   My background is Computer Engineering and Computer Science, more or less both hardware and software.   My portfolio is very heavy on tech stocks but
4 2018-03-15 23:56:38 What do we want?! (Literally any of these: a thread)

1. Universal Background Checks
2. Mandatory waiting periods to buy a gun
3. Raise the minimum age to buy a gun to the same as buying a beer
4. Ban the sale of Bump Stocks
5 2018-03-15 23:56:30 I’m not saying let drum mags and bump stocks roam free, I’m saying that you don’t necessarily have to join a militia to have the right/privilege to own a gun. Although yes, I agree hi cap mags such as drums and Bstocks aren’t meant for civi use.
6 2018-03-15 23:55:47 Oh gosh, i just meant to expose an argument for bump stocks.  Nothing against you whatsoever.  How can i rephrase?
7 2018-03-15 23:54:47 @snapchatsupport your stocks are going down because instead of giving users more customization options, you change everything to the point that snaps no longer appear in chronological order and tell them they will enjoy it more. Why are friends I never talked to above my recents?
8 2018-03-15 23:53:38 Last question...could you THEORETICALLY put other assets like stocks, bonds, car titles, social security number etc.. on LTC/BTC blockchain as well? Not just cryptos right? Correct me if I'm wrong I may be ahead of myself..

15 2018-03-15 23:50:28 Is this a thing? Does this happen often? Does a bill have to be introduce to ban this? We don’t ban assault weapons or even bump stocks but sure as hell we have to ban pets in an overhead. And lickety split.

43 2018-03-15 23:45:54 They didn't only buy Keyeast, they also bought some whole lot of stocks of FNC Ent's subsidiary company. In a bigger picture, they are trying to become a media giant like CJ by using DA's TV stuffs, Keyeast's actor pools and know-how, and FNC's content making know-hows.
44 2018-03-15 23:45:46 Just had a guy jump in my inbox to tell me that I was stupid for suggesting that a couple of years ago that bump stocks could be used in a mass shooting. He also told me I should educate myself.

48 2018-03-15 23:43:13 With political bribes the @NRA created our dystopian reality where felons can buy an AR-15 undetected at gun shows, assault weapons are unregulated, bump stocks are legal, and children being massacred at school is common. The @NRA greased the wheels of children being murdered.

63 2018-03-15 23:37:37 3) To me it seems that @potus knows something about bump stocks that we don't know. You'd think the Dems would call the EO a win, instead they're trying to obstruct it. Wonder why? Maybe they're favored by some for use in false flags? I dunno, it's not black & white.

64 2018-03-15 23:35:09 The thing to do now is say you're checking stocks to see if any missing and traceable.
65 2018-03-15 23:34:42 I suppose the NRA and AR-15 automatic rifles with bump stocks were to blame. /sarcasm. It was installed LAST WEEK.
66 2018-03-15 23:34:02 2)And this:
"The acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives acknowledged Wed that he has been told by some attorneys that banning bump fire stocks through exec regulation would lead to court challenges that would delay the implementation of a ban"

68 2018-03-15 23:32:40 Chris is good looking and Trump did file for bankruptcy several times and negotiating a deal for all of America, based on his bankruptcies, America is headed for a downfall.  Trump alone has sunk the stocks 6 times since his presidency, a drug user is now his economic advisor!
69 2018-03-15 23:32:39 One really stupid thing that all these people keep doing is trying to say that liberals want to "take away the guns" but that's not true it's impossible to "ban guns" they just want to 
-Ban weapons of war
-Ban Bump Stocks and high cap mags
-Make it harder for crazies to get guns
70 2018-03-15 23:31:42 If it was deliberate, then there is no excuse. If, as I suspect, it's the result of designers with no real understanding of football, trying to capture a market, then it's unfortunate. Either way, the line needs discontinuing and stocks destroyed.

I recall a young man with his old mother
no doubt her stock he is getting intrest on+her pension

88 2018-03-15 23:18:40 What do you consider an assault weapon? Raising the age is a fair compromise. Bump stocks are pointless as is the decrease your accuracy significantly I’m fine with that.
89 2018-03-15 23:18:08 right? and he was like selling stocks not in existence to people to skim money?
90 2018-03-15 23:17:27 Made a stock list 2 days ago and 5/8 stocks did exactly what I planned on, 2/8 I’m still waiting and only 1 did ok

93 2018-03-15 23:16:16 federally raise the buying age. stop selling bump stocks. and banning assault weapons would be a good start.
94 2018-03-15 23:15:16 Many stocks have formed the same structure. Either symmetrical triangle, rising wedge, or bearish flag. The tendency to the downside is higher, but not confirmed. Be careful.

111 2018-03-15 23:05:45 I can't. it hasn't happened. Yet.
However, the las Vegas shooter managed more than 120 rounds per minute in less than 8 minutes and hit 480 people, killing 58. Yeah, I know, bump stocks and multiple guns...yada,yada,yada. I don't want to take that risk.
112 2018-03-15 23:05:40 I’m sorry that family lost their dog, but it’s been almost six months since 58 people died and 851 were injured by a single shooter in Las Vegas. Do you have any plans to introduce legislation to ban bump stocks?

#EnoughIsEnough
#EndGunViolence
113 2018-03-15 23:04:54 True and that’s why I think bump stocks and some of the attachments should be illegal. It’s okay to have the rifle though because without the bump stock it is just a semi-automatic weapon and can not be fired automatically.

123 2018-03-15 22:56:14 Market analysts focus almost the entirety of their efforts on speculating about large cap stocks, not small cap. #Analysts #Market
124 2018-03-15 22:56:09 @sainsburys you haven't had any House Merlot Red Wine on your online site for weeks now and no stocks in the stores I went to the other day! Have you stopped doing this line? Cheers.
125 2018-03-15 22:55:46 Idk if you’re being sarcastic or not, but Rihanna got snapchat stocks to go down in value because they had a game advertisement that had said “Would you rather slap rihanna or punch chris brown?”
126 2018-03-15 22:55:30 Sign up for Robinhood to invest in Bitcoin and stocks, and we’ll both get a free stock like Apple, Ford, or Sprint!

127 2018-03-15 22:53:01 Step in the right direction.  Now on to gun legislation. Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines now, do it tomorrow
128 2018-03-15 22:52:54 @BBCWorldTonight Has anyone bothered to check if there are any stocks of Novichok missing from OUR chemical weapons dumps?
After all, wouldn't be in the least surprised to learn that they're "guarded" by G4S!
129 2018-03-15 22:52:52 No, look tax payers got fined. I bought bank stocks in 2009. One of the best investments ever. But then again I passed on bitcoin in 2010
130 2018-03-15 22:51:48 No it does not.  Unless it includes bans on military weapons and bump stocks all it does is appease the NRA. @realDonaldTrump
131 2018-03-15 22:51:21 They had their chance to do something during the last admin & sat on their asses while Obama allowed the sale of bump stocks!
132 2018-03-15 22:48:48 Rihanna causing #SnapChat #stocks to drop. Already dropped by nearly 5%.
133 2018-03-15 22:46:08 The Dow has closed in the bottom half of the day's trading range for 4 days in a row. The run has extended to 5 days only once in the 340 sessions since 4 November 2016, the exception coming on 7 September 2017, 131 trading days ago #stocks
134 2018-03-15 22:45:33 IS THE STOCK MARKET UNDER VALUED - OR - OVER VALUED NOW ? #Stocks #Trump #History #WarrenBuffett #Value #Momentum
135 2018-03-15 22:43:10 Yeah, it reminds people of low unemployment, high stocks, and tax cuts. Ugh!
136 2018-03-15 22:42:12 YEah one that bans bump stocks... something uninvolved in the shooting   <slow clap >  Anything for the emotional 'do something!' mob.

142 2018-03-15 22:38:11 Next to Illinois, specifically Chicago, California has arguably the strictest gun laws in the country. With magazine limitations dropping to 7 rounds and bump stocks being nationally banned, the only next step is to remove them from the owners, which you claim you don’t want to.
143 2018-03-15 22:36:59 Your observation matches the criticism that has become public, and embedded inside broker research reports, over the past weeks/months. Just goes to show... management hubris is the biggest threat to every successful business... #ausbiz #XJO #investing $WES #stocks #equities
144 2018-03-15 22:36:33 2000-2010. Two massive economy crashes to take profit. 

Sorry for stocks if you started in 2000...
145 2018-03-15 22:35:03 Just spoke to a couple that lives in Parkland Florida and their kids were in a different school but she got to meet with the governor of Florida and even though bump stocks have been outlawed in stores you can still buy them at gun shows or another state and bring them back to FL
146 2018-03-15 22:34:42 I have really conflicted feelings about it. It's strange to be growing thousands of sterile fish downtown just so people can fish them. But I know it exists b/c people would otherwise overwhelm the wild stocks.
147 2018-03-15 22:32:56 Mr. Fabulous may have some fabulous news on the way :) Hold on to your stocks and try not to watch them every couple of hours.
148 2018-03-15 22:32:54 It’s hard to say. If everything works out it will definitely not be 6 months or more, like @Analyze4dollars is predicting. There are things in the making.

151 2018-03-15 22:30:43 @rtp180 So you get some Bitcoin, then what? Can you trade it for goods and services or do you instead hold on to it and hope it grows in value, and then sell, like with stocks? How does the "value" come back to the owner, or is it always digital? #rtp180
152 2018-03-15 22:27:00 There were plenty of stocks up yesterday... Amcor, Aristocrat, Bapcor, Computershare, etc etc The panel didn't fully understand what I was trying to say, but hey, it happens @FNArena @SkyNewsBiz
153 2018-03-15 22:25:53 Unless bump stocks and weapons which kill many persons as quickly as possible are banned nothing has been done.  This act is not a modest first step, but rather a wholesale act of appeasement of the NRA.  Cowards until the NRA is faced down. @realDonaldTrump

He, like his colleagues at CNBC, especially Jim Cramer, specialize in bulling stocks and the economy -  it's all no pain all gain - you too can be rich. He is allergic the evidence based research.  He is like Trump - he makes things up as he goes

160 2018-03-15 22:23:57 As a lifelong conservative, why do you all cave in to the NRA?
It has to be money as common sense dictates otherwise.  A reasonable solution is to ban AR-15’s and bump stocks. You’ll still preserve the intent of the 2nd amendment.
161 2018-03-15 22:23:55 @Greenbackd do you know if anyone has created an acquirers multiple stock screener for aussie stocks?
162 2018-03-15 22:23:40 You're right. It's something like stocks in England. The notes on him suggest that he's a criminal convicted by the government of Shanghai County.
163 2018-03-15 22:23:25 Shhhh. They think we are stupid and don't realize that companies are buying back their stocks.
164 2018-03-15 22:23:12 They did but when we went stocks were low - fingers crossed they might have stocked back up for when you see them. Enjoy!
165 2018-03-15 22:22:59 Yeah my new shares one carat of gemI seriously think that's betterBuy div stocks later more income
166 2018-03-15 22:21:41 We need you and the house and senate to ban bump stocks, ban assault rifles,  raise the age one needs to be to own a gun, and stronger background checks.  We need serious gun reform.  Ban things not necessary for sport or self defense.

170 2018-03-15 22:17:06 Need to target laws at gun manufacturers and sellers, they’ll ban bump stocks themselves if they get penalized every time there’s a mass shooting
171 2018-03-15 22:15:24 @FXS_Stocks_DE @TheElvisCooper @alynnroy - You're my top new connects this week!
172 2018-03-15 22:15:19 Yeah, Heller created this right in 2008, so it’s settled law, regardless of what the framers meant. In the meantime, we have people who want firearms for hunting or self defense, and those with fantasies of armed rebellion, which is all you really need hi cap mags/bump stocks for
173 2018-03-15 22:14:16 So are you saying stocks dont have painful moments. Lets see what you think of Crypto in a year or 2... I'm sure you'll be saying," Whoops I was wrong!" If you dont do research of course you will be screwed.  AND IF YOUR THAT STUPID TO INVEST IN BITCONNECT ETC THEN YOU DESERVE IT
174 2018-03-15 22:12:42 While I support this, it seems that our personal pets are better taken care of then our endangered species and our citizens(including children) when it comes to banning AR-15’s, bump stocks, and stricter gun laws. #JustSaying #GunControlNow #CommonSense #EndangeredSpecies
175 2018-03-15 22:12:41 my portfolio = around 10 stocks no more. And I will never touch to this crypo bullshit. Some people will get smoked

180 2018-03-15 22:10:54 A lot of traditional bankers and analysts have pointed out that #Bitcoin might be in a price #bubble but this raises the question of whether stocks and bonds in public markets are not in even more of a bubble.
181 2018-03-15 22:09:19 @tonyvincent @Stocktwits I want stocks that are acting well/turning higher out of coiled base patterns. These are breaking down near lows

206 2018-03-15 21:54:48 That's a lot better than the stores I frequent ever have. It's mostly uninteresting and very popular 2000s series and movies on DVD. One of my favourite record stores stocks a lot of untranslated 90s OVAs for some reason though.
207 2018-03-15 21:54:07 That's all in hindsight, i didn't see any of these stocks but most likely no body knew they will run before they run.
208 2018-03-15 21:53:49 Stocks closed mixed. Dow +115 points, S&amp;P and NASDAQ end a bit lower.
209 2018-03-15 21:53:39 Obama brought in bump stocks used at Mandalay Bay and Biden wrote the gun free kill box legislation. Now the Broward Cowards have armed protection after that #standdownorder. This is all staged. They're killing Americans and smiling about it while their jackasses bray at the WH.

213 2018-03-15 21:50:54 2 amendment doesn't mean unlimited access any weapons. Why does NRA oppose a ban on bump stocks? It's not a weapon, but an attachment to make a weapon more dangerous.
214 2018-03-15 21:50:50 How about the people responsible for this policy be put in stocks in the town square? Put them back in a century that seems to believe still exists.

216 2018-03-15 21:50:21 Delaware has already made bump stocks illegal. That being said, I don’t think all guns should be made illegal, but some modifications like this don’t seem to benefit anyone but criminals.
217 2018-03-15 21:50:17 really can't understand anybody who's against the banning of bump fire stocks

223 2018-03-15 21:47:04 ...primary care services and support programs for families and schools. He is working on banning bump stocks. So you have: updated criminal background checks, ban on bump stocks, an increase in integrative mental health agencies, giving states the power to decide age limit
224 2018-03-15 21:45:33 Thanks much for the comment. #Beta ratio in fact covers price moves up or down, so it doesn't always correlate with relative strength. $ACAD $ADMS $ARNC $ALB $AVAV are a few examples of #stocks down sharply YTD and betas of 1.10 or higher

231 2018-03-15 21:38:58 That cannibalism you're speaking of goes right to the heart of stock buybacks. Make capital investments? Nah. Just lay people off or take out debt so you can buy your own stocks and LOOK profitable in the short term. Executives get bonuses, then move onto a new job.

So your science fiction fantasy is going up, but the real economy is going down. Great success
236 2018-03-15 21:36:49 Someone should have added an amendment to ban AR rifles, bump stocks.
237 2018-03-15 21:36:32 Keep those "Light Ends" flowing. Domestic NAT-GAZ, & Gas Condensate, are vital links as Fuel, Feed-Stocks, & Freedom from imported HydroCarbons. Exports of LNG & Ethane, are important 2nd sources for the European Market, helping US Trade Balance.

239 2018-03-15 21:36:13 I had found that video after the Vegas shooting. Bump stocks are just an accessory. It would be sick and cruel joke if they ban them because you know they will stop right there and declare they did something. Banning bump stocks is a fart in the wind.
240 2018-03-15 21:36:11 Yes, it's twitter, and Donald Trump by proposing the banning of bump stocks has made a more reasonable argument than you have.
241 2018-03-15 21:35:53 ISIS is on the ropes, the tax plan is a grand slam, jobs and stocks are thru the roof, unemployment, including black and Hispanic unemployment, is at a record low, and morons want to #RESIST HAHAHA! DOPES. #MAGA

254 2018-03-15 21:30:54 Yes, I get it. You like to form opinions without facts. It makes your arguments unpersuasive. “Bump stocks” are not about “accuracy.” They are about converting semi-autos into autos. Your arguments are beside the point. People kill. Therefore, let us limit who can get weapons.
255 2018-03-15 21:30:47 Late spring and low fodder stocks would be my guess. Were there a lot of acres available?

258 2018-03-15 21:27:35 "Activist investors" are one of the worst symptoms of capitalism. They gut businesses like Toys R Us to turn a profit for their few investors, then leave the ruins behind. This is why stocks are soaring while the economy on the ground, for real people, is crumbling

260 2018-03-15 21:25:28 So much cluelessness out there on shooting matters! They would benfit greatly by following and listening to you Pat! To the best of my knowledge you were the 1st to mention bump stocks regarding the Las Vegas incident!! 
261 2018-03-15 21:24:55 Excuse me. Please reread what I said bc I literally said the exact same thing you did lol. Seriously I said nothing at all to cause your tirade on bump stocks lol.

263 2018-03-15 21:24:23 Bump stocks have never ever killed one person. Your drugs, your policies,and your ignorance kills!
264 2018-03-15 21:23:29 @AdamPOlsen @AprilVokey @WilliamShatner 

You guys should get together/do a show to raise awarness regarding the plight of Steelhead and Salmon stocks. Adam have you ever been spey fishing? I imagine a half fishing adventure half political education/explanation show.
265 2018-03-15 21:22:12 Terrifying that a convicted felon can still get their hands on this arsenal of weapons. None of these AR’s/bump stocks belong in regular folks hands. What a joke that our police force have to worry about coming up against assault weapons. Thanks for everything you do.

Long-term I still want a fund to replace staples stocks. Hoping T Rowe's new $PGLOX scales enough to lower the crazy 4% gross expense ratio.
269 2018-03-15 21:20:00 That intent was clearly established with the little line on their site saying they take stake in these kinds of things. They manipulate the market (intel's been found guilty of this before and looks like it's gonna happen again) and bet on shorting stocks. Done and done.

277 2018-03-15 21:17:08 Generally before the conclusion of the contract. This tends to be very quick after client agreement for MiFID business as online so, in practice, SR needs to be before advice meeting. Pensions may take longer to conclude and hence more leeway

284 2018-03-15 21:14:45 The #NYMEX and #DRAISafterhours experiences where by far the most chaotic, rewarding, memorable chapters of my life.  I learned to be calm under extreme chaos.  WRS and slinging stocks at JP Turner come a close second.
285 2018-03-15 21:14:37 Yep. We've been the same for long long time. Best way for everyone. Can't imagine anyone signing their DB away without having a report beforehand ... Seemingly some have.... worrying to say the least.

287 2018-03-15 21:13:33 So what’s the definition of a crash and a dip? This goes for crypto, stocks and housing. I think people are confused with these terms and it makes a huge difference in my opinion. Seems like everyone assumes a crash when your portfolio is 10% down. #btc #bitcoin #stocks #eth #ltc

291 2018-03-15 21:12:05 I think bump stocks are a joke. It's one of those stupid 'tacticool' items that are completely pointless. As for magazines? What about them? I use a 13 round mag for my pistol. I also have a 22 round one for it just because.

296 2018-03-15 21:10:13 Ban bump stocks, not AR-15s. The bump stock attachment on any rifle can allow for a higher rate of fire, similar to an automatic. This is what people need to understand, and it should be easier to regulate these as well.

300 2018-03-15 21:09:24 you know that's bullshit. You do remain the best at stocks though, which is nice.
301 2018-03-15 21:09:15 Stop? No. Of course not. That's impossible. The key is to reduce, both in frequency and in damage. If we keep on the topic of mass shootings specifically though a good thing to do would be banning bump stocks with immediate effect as we all know that would have meant less shot.

306 2018-03-15 21:07:57 2/2
they purposely target stocks with inexperienced traders, sharp increases and high volatility and disguise the short attack with a big news release which is exactly what happend to SX.  P&D is not what your interpretation is plain and simple. EOM

308 2018-03-15 21:05:59 Great. Now, how about assault riffles, bump stocks, increasing purchase age, mental health restrictions?

325 2018-03-15 21:02:12 Banning some based on their aesthetic will ultimately lead to a ban on all. Those bad bad bump stocks are replaced by a rubber band just an FYI and many already know that. The accessory is just a toe hold. At the end of the day the rail system, and such doesn't change capability

331 2018-03-15 21:00:03 I do think that bump stocks should be heavily regulated, but I hope you know that turning. semi-auto rifle into a fully auto is illegal. So are you proposing we ban all guns? Because again, AR-15s are a lot weaker than a lot of guns that don't look as "scary."
332 2018-03-15 20:59:57 Stocks did terrible today 
333 2018-03-15 20:59:38 Hawk amendment to ban bump stocks fails 20-20. #ksleg
334 2018-03-15 20:57:34 Dems are putting forward series of amendments on CCR bill - bump stocks, red flag etc. Hardy votes no on 1st, says he’s going to vote no on the underlying bill, doesn’t want to bother with amendments. Amendment fails by his vote. I’m not happy. #ksleg
335 2018-03-15 20:57:15 @ROWNTREES Where can I buy Randoms Easter Eggs. My niece & nephew have both requested them but I can’t find anyone who stocks them? Thanks in advance
336 2018-03-15 20:56:37 By following equity charts of hot stocks. It’s not just the monthly but also 10ema for daily and weekly. These pullbacks are usually good for buys. Also look at the full 2013 bitcoin monthly chart
337 2018-03-15 20:56:26 Excuse me, but who needs a bump stock? And how on earth would that, in any way, violate the 2nd amend? And why does the NRA need to back that decision? Bump stocks turn guns into weapons meant for war, able to kill as many people as possible in little time
338 2018-03-15 20:55:18 They have stocks of Anthrax vaccine that's nearing it's end date and looking for the cheapest way to dump it? You know..being environmentally friendly?
339 2018-03-15 20:54:44 I don’t think there is a requirement for any advice to have a pre report although MiFID has changed that a bit I think. I moved to pre a while back for all new cases but most reviews still post meeting. @rorypercival will know
340 2018-03-15 20:53:44 Haley says he's an avid supporter of the 2nd amendment, but supports the amendment. He first heard of bump stocks after the Las Vegas shooting and promised that if there came a day when he could do something about them he would.  #ksleg
341 2018-03-15 20:52:28 Bump stocks don't kill ... people do....take all guns to .... criminals will just use box cutters?
342 2018-03-15 20:52:02 I think differently. So does the Supreme Court. Some military grade weapons should only be held by the military. I’m also against all high capacity magazines and bump stocks.
343 2018-03-15 20:52:01 Unlike many people you'll come across, I'm not an idiot in the matter. I've never once said guns should be taken away, or rights infringed upon. There's a reason why bump stocks are to become illegal soon. I've never heard of "replicating" a fully auto rifle with your arm.

348 2018-03-15 20:50:16 I still say there was more than one shooter. Bump stocks are highly inaccurate. Shooting from the 32nd fl. I dunno. No surveillance video of any kind whatsoever? It still sounds fishy to me. Yes, people died, but I think there was waaay more to it then what was mentioned.
349 2018-03-15 20:50:14 @monicataher me a inspirado a invertir en stocks. Siempre e tenido la curiosidad pero nunca nadie a podido explicarme (o talvez no han querido ) Gracias por compartirnos sus conocimientos y consejos! #mujerespoderosas

361 2018-03-15 20:46:35 If I had dumped 10K into ford when it was tanked I would have made a tidy profit. I only purchased a few hundred dollars worth though. I never put a lot into stocks because it I just "Vegas from Home" to me.
362 2018-03-15 20:46:35 @bigfry @Stocktwits A trading plan needs to have multiple levels I feel. The main function is to be an outline (buy stocks in uptrends)

369 2018-03-15 20:44:54 Hi Andy, I will check my stocks tomorrow and let you know, I think I might have sold my last one in stock last night, but I will confirm. What size eight do you use? Potentially I have another option for you......
370 2018-03-15 20:44:51 @SenJohnMcCain, You get a group of supporters together/send me a trip out/back + I will share w/you a solution that will stop gun violence! Seriously. Think how tiny that is, after: Bump stocks/age/mental/officers N schools/Bk Gd checks/metal detectors, outlaw AR15+ = WONT WORK
371 2018-03-15 20:44:21 Im one of them. No more FB and political news. I now watch CNBC for market news and no longer get stressed out. Unless my stocks are losing!
372 2018-03-15 20:44:01 @sautterinvest @Stocktwits Or if the market pulls back to the 50 Day SMA I look for stocks that held the 20 Day an so forth.
373 2018-03-15 20:44:01 This was during a time of oppressive gov, a time when slavery was allowed. Things have changed and it is no longer as relevant as it used to be. I'm not calling for a ban on weapons or dropping the 2nd amendment,  just common sense gun laws and bans on bump stocks and such
374 2018-03-15 20:43:59 How many bump stocks will be surrendered to #Denver over the next 5 years:

#copolitics #gunsense
375 2018-03-15 20:43:34 Senate working SB 2042, concealed-carry reciprocity. @LynnRogers4KS now offering amdt to ban sale/use of bump stocks. #ksleg
376 2018-03-15 20:43:31 @sautterinvest @Stocktwits How an individual stock is performing relative to the index. I look for stocks that pullback less for example
377 2018-03-15 20:43:30 With all Toys R Us closing, what major retailer stocks your products besides online?
@NECA_TOYS
378 2018-03-15 20:43:25 Now onto HB 2042 reciprocity bill. @LynnRogers4KS will amendment to ban bump stocks. #MomsDemand #ksleg
379 2018-03-15 20:42:26 "I believe these changes will make a better future for our state, especially for our children and grandchildren." Hawk then yields to Sen. Rogers for an amendment on bump stocks. #ksleg
380 2018-03-15 20:41:49 Tryna get these free stocks yo got a couple already be my 5 one guys come on it's free
381 2018-03-15 20:41:48 Every week it's bad press. And the reality is that no one with a channel or selling a program will sound negative because they have an incentive to keep people following them. It's called business. But the reality is that crypto will be lucky if it comes back. This isn't stocks.
382 2018-03-15 20:41:35 Come TRADE Options & Stocks LIVE w/ us next week for FREE (w/ full access to the blackbox site)!! SERIOUS responses below pls! 
383 2018-03-15 20:41:11  Snapchat definitely messed with the wrong person ... Riri really got pissed. Did I hear ppl leaving the app and stocks dropping? Anyways the app is really becoming annoying and useless this days been months I opened mine though... Good luck snapchat...
384 2018-03-15 20:41:03 Baseball cards worked liked stocks just like everything else we collect so whats the real difference. And for the record,you’re super easy to bait about shit like this.still love you tho,been following on most social meds for years.
385 2018-03-15 20:40:54 $ULTA is such a beast.. Love it. #Stocks
386 2018-03-15 20:40:50 I advise people NOT to buy #stocks to make a killing in #bullmarket. Buy #equities that pay #dividends at a good yield and increase them annually. Trying to rely only on stock price to make money is very risky. Buy and Hold companies that are ethical and pay dividends!!
387 2018-03-15 20:40:48 Stocks closed mixed. Dow +115 points, S&amp;P and NASDAQ end a bit lower.
388 2018-03-15 20:40:18 The intent for bump stocks is to get around the law and to have a automatic, military grade weapon. The @NRA is making so much money from it
389 2018-03-15 20:40:15 Firstly - what stocks are paying 10% dividends in your example? I would like to buy them if they exist.
390 2018-03-15 20:39:48 To all my TE experts: What say you about Jordan Leggett, Michael Roberts, and Adam Shaheen's stocks this year after the past week?
391 2018-03-15 20:39:44 @vladstocks you have an imposter, man.  @vlad_stocks 
392 2018-03-15 20:39:41 Good point. The stocks they've got are small and EFPs probably don't add that many to qualify as ATGM-rich.
393 2018-03-15 20:39:11 Yes $ADBE isnt cheap, but who what tech stocks have better fundamentals and market opportunity? i'd argue we're undervalued
394 2018-03-15 20:39:04 Free trials Stocks and options and all the chatrooms etc. let us know below.
395 2018-03-15 20:38:27 I don't think they can... Not compliantly, as how can you evidence the rationale without documenting the arguements, advice and justification? Having said that, advice must have been documented as being give unless (unlikely) CETV <£30k
396 2018-03-15 20:38:22 No constitutional right to modify arms. Ban bump stocks now. No constitutional definition of magazine sizes. Ban large capacity magazines now.
397 2018-03-15 20:37:16 I agree definitely w bump stocks and like being banned...but, still so much info on internet how to build bombs (more destructive). Turn semi autos to fully or close to fully automatic weapons. Info shld be banned as well! Then ppl will argue 1A??
Hi vol magazines ok to ban
398 2018-03-15 20:37:11 Well, that actually is surprising. But good to hear. I support expanded or universal background checks and don't have a comment either way on the bump stocks. Never saw a need for one.
399 2018-03-15 20:36:42 RT LesliePicker: SEC’s Robert Jackson says that of the 81 cyber breaches at public companies in 2017, only 2 chose to disclose via 8-K, even though stocks tend to decline. He says insider trading is ‘one of the most troubling implications of the scandals in this area’ (i.e. …
400 2018-03-15 20:36:38 @XanderBaldwin @Stocktwits In general there are no such things as "must own" stocks for me. I hold as long as my strategy is valid
401 2018-03-15 20:36:12 @All_in_or_nothing See more of this all the time.  Traders obsessed (fall in love) with the stocks they own. They'll hold no matter what.
402 2018-03-15 20:35:53 Serious question: is it a requirement to do pre-sale SR for DB. All our advice has had SR presale for that long, I've forgot whether it's a requirement or whether we do it as it's the right thing to do????
403 2018-03-15 20:34:33 again bump stocks are not illegal
404 2018-03-15 20:34:16 No, like actual machine guns.  The guy in Vegas used bump stocks presumably because machine guns were difficult to come by.  The 'everyone will buy them illegally' argument they made is bs.
405 2018-03-15 20:33:55 Fine. You’ve won. Now focus on YOUR stocks, and what makes them so great to trade. What you are doing now is bashing another stock to promote yourself for being “right” (which you’re not. $BYOC will prevail). This is not a good look. Now move along.
406 2018-03-15 20:33:46 World stocks mixed: Europe +.5%; S&P 500 -.1%. Combination of trade fears, Trump's Muller problems & an unfavorable FERC regulation weighed on US stocks. Headline risk will continue for some time but there is little economic risk short of all out trade war that is still unlikely.
407 2018-03-15 20:31:21 It's not cubes but I highly recommend @Carolsstocks 'Stock Market's stocks as they are wonderful. Can always buy a few and freeze.
408 2018-03-15 20:30:06 
409 2018-03-15 20:29:18 Beauty day. Thankfully my stocks took care of themselves while I've been both working and trying to oversee the installation of a new driveway exit on our property. $REZ up 16%. $HS.c up 25% - hope that holds. Good news for $CANN.c and $BB. And $THCX closed above $4.00! Love it.
410 2018-03-15 20:27:58 So your criticism of him is that he had 2 monster calls early and right but stuck w those calls when they inevitably mean reverted some like 100% of stocks do?
411 2018-03-15 20:27:37 SEC’s Robert Jackson says that of the 81 cyber breaches at public companies in 2017, only 2 chose to disclose via 8-K, even though stocks tend to decline.

412 2018-03-15 20:27:36 There’s a lot of conflicting info on internet...can u tell me why people use bump stocks if not to fire more bullets/minute? From what I’ve read, the bump stock enables recoil upon firing 2 cause finger contact w/trigger again...then repeat over & over? I’d like 2 understand...
413 2018-03-15 20:26:32 The Senate has defeated SA 1 to HB 300, appropriating $30,000 for compensation of relinquished bump stocks and trigger cranks, 10 yes - 9 no, with 1 not voting and 1 absent.  #netde #deleg
414 2018-03-15 20:26:01 very well done, time the stocks were brought back.
415 2018-03-15 20:25:57 The more educated crypto traders are now starting to trade stocks as they see a much more predictable way to make monies versus trading the low volume altcoins. Getting much better return on investment in trading stocks.  Easy money is over in crypto.
416 2018-03-15 20:25:48 Sounds great. 

Oh wait, bump stocks r REALLY easy to make yourself. Better ban garages

Oh wait, especially if you have a 3D printer. Better ban thoses too. 

Oh wait, you can bump fire certain guns w/a shoulder technique, u don’t need a special stock. Better ban shoulders too
417 2018-03-15 20:24:15 Lol. Bro, you can't turn a semi into an auto. Impossible. The bump stocks is a piece of crap tool that's inaccurate that's allows you shoot faster but it's useless. Go ahead and ban that crap.
418 2018-03-15 20:24:04 Thank you so much John x
419 2018-03-15 20:23:30 Did you play $ULTA today before ER? Good job, easy good money. #Stocks
420 2018-03-15 20:23:21 Its been broad-based, but the S&P 500 is market cap weighted so the bigger stocks matter more. The stats: Of the 10 days $SPX was up 1% or more, on average 73% of the tech sector was higher by 1% or more. On 5 of these days 80% of tech was 1% or higher.
421 2018-03-15 20:21:18 Weird that your hotel stocks so much lumber in your room
422 2018-03-15 20:20:24 I love that #commodities typically exhibit positive skewness whereas stocks exhibit negative skewness.  For instance, if a corn crop goes bad corn futures shoot up.  If something bad happens to stocks, prices fall off a cliff.  #BCOM #Agricultural
423 2018-03-15 20:20:20 "Highly Likely" is an opinion NOT evidence! This gas was developed by the Soviet Union in 1970's, Ukraine+Georgia also have stocks! "Russian Govt did this!"-evidence?
424 2018-03-15 20:20:11 Dude- growth stocks are not the go for people whose next stop is the crematorium. Their investment horizon is not quite suited to that strategy shall we say.
425 2018-03-15 20:19:38 1. My understanding is that the Americans were over in Russia in the 90's assisting with the dismantling of the Soviet Chem Weapon Stocks. Novichok is part of a 'family' of similar nerve agents. The chemical make up is well known.
426 2018-03-15 20:19:26 QOTD:   If you are a cryptocurrency/altcoin trader, are you interested in learning how to trade stocks. Especially now that you are learning how to read technicals & crypto charts.
427 2018-03-15 20:18:56 I am not done with NVCN yet. Everyone keep selling you morons! Shorty is my nickname. One for me shorting stocks, and one for my short micropenis. #claymustpay #scamtrader #boycottihub
428 2018-03-15 20:18:55 @claudio69 do any stocks really rep their actual value or just the psychology of what ppl will pay 4it per share X total shares =market cap
429 2018-03-15 20:18:30 @Student_Of_The_Game those big buys at close are ETFs rebalancing. Miners are unique in this because more people buy the etf than the stocks
430 2018-03-15 20:18:20 The solution to this..is to ban putting dogs in overhead compartments on planes but--arm the dogs with AR 15's and bum stocks so they can protect their human masters. Don't put teachers at risk when we can mobilize a dog militia and train them to prevent human insanity.
431 2018-03-15 20:17:43 no civilian needs an automatic weapon, bump stocks, or silencers. really they don’t need anything more than a weapon to protect themselves. anything else is frankly unnecessary
432 2018-03-15 20:17:40 You SIR have uncovered my true intentions. For that I will be shorting out of more stocks as long as I can!
433 2018-03-15 20:16:14 Except wall street firms continuously trash U.S. companies , their stocks, and their investors, and have been doing so for the last three quarters now despite record earnings/forecasts. PEs and PEGs keep dropping and they still get trashed. SCAM! Investing now
434 2018-03-15 20:16:12 I understand that the handgun is also used in murders but for people who commit mass murder they would want a weapon that shoots faster and kills faster. That’s the AR style guns. Bump stocks and large magazines. I just don’t want people to die from these guns anymore.
435 2018-03-15 20:16:08 Given that commodites have negative (and statistically significant) correlations to bonds, it seems like a no brainer for fixed income heavy portfolios to start allocating to #commodities.  Remember, commodities are a better hedge to inflation than #stocks and #bonds!
436 2018-03-15 20:15:54 I had bought at 110 and sold at 170 levels ..is was a good share and has low PE but I guess there is some problems with promoters renumeration, hiding subsidiary results and taking stocks as warrant at discounted price and selling in market ..so stay away from Pix Transmission
437 2018-03-15 20:15:51 That's exactly inductive reasoning he was banging on about!!!! if either porton down has significant stocks for easy testing or can synthesise it, then the immediate  "it can be only Russia" conclusion is really suspect
438 2018-03-15 20:12:50 $SPX 3/16 regular options will expire at the open and settle with the average opening price of the 500 stocks together using ticker $SET.

Look for movement in price premarket of the usual suspects if they want to push that open one way or the other.
439 2018-03-15 20:12:43 Snapchat must’ve faced major deflation in stocks 
440 2018-03-15 20:11:48 Hi I don't use Snap Chat so the fact they use Rihanna DV as a ad for a joke is sick good that their stocks are falling.
441 2018-03-15 20:11:16 Gun Control... My only idea I have is only certified competition gun users should be allowed to use any hand gun over .45, a rifle only semi auto no scopes longer than 4x, no caliber above 7.62. No stocks, no trigger tools, guns inspected every few years by sheriff r get fined.
442 2018-03-15 20:11:08 If you can’t keep leftover money I guess you could just throw your leftover into stocks or other investments
443 2018-03-15 20:11:01 Tech stocks that institutional investors with 5%+ ownership are still buying as disclosed in the last 7 days: $IPHI $CTXS $MCHP $MRVL $SYNC $SSTI #InstitutionalSponsorship
444 2018-03-15 20:11:00 Giving investment advice now? Growth stocks are risky investments...not great for pensioners.
How about just commenting on ill conceived Labor tax policy?

447 2018-03-15 20:09:55 Only if you consider this a crash. +/-$50 in the crypto world is normal. If you looking at traditional stocks, that’s a whole different story. 
448 2018-03-15 20:09:39 Corporations are people, EXECUTE the company that built that bridge for acts pf mirder.  All corporate assets seized and immediately liquidated.  And stocks and bonds for the company are forfeit and lost without compensation.
449 2018-03-15 20:08:34 where is the Democratic bill that just goes after bump stocks, high capacity magazines? where is Democratic bill that just deals with background checks? (a big subject) where is the Australia-like semi-auto rifle licensing/buyback bill? (the new “assault weapons ban?”)

453 2018-03-15 20:07:30 Despite what you might think, I am a gun owner. Raised with them even. I don’t want to ban all guns. And all polling shows that the vast majority of people support expanded back round checks, red flag laws, and barring the sale of bump-stocks etc.

456 2018-03-15 20:06:45 Because the bill is a piece of crap that dodges the real issues. You want to pass something the media will notice? Start with a ban on assault rifles and bump stocks. May not fix everything but it has to help. You and Scott Taylor could sponsor if you’re not Afraid of the NRA
457 2018-03-15 20:06:37 Stocks mixed. The Dow climbed & dipped over 300 pts, closing at 24,873.66, up 115.54 (+0.47%). Nasdaq -0.20%. S&P -0.08%.

459 2018-03-15 20:04:31 #stocks#ThursdayThoughts   What's unmistakable about the stock market is this:  the 10 year long  bull market is unraveling
460 2018-03-15 20:03:01 I’d rather sit around and watch stocks than stream  adulting
461 2018-03-15 20:02:10 It's not a gun issue either. It's a "People" Issue. There's no way to prevent an event like the Vegas shooting. It was beyond what anyone culd've seen coming. What can be done is what's being done; which is making laws for stricter background checks, banning bump stocks, etc.
462 2018-03-15 20:01:37 Bump stocks do not increase the rate of  fire of any weapon.
463 2018-03-15 20:00:02 Why should bump stocks, which give semi-automatic rifles approx. same capability as automatic weapons b legal? Should legalize weapons, including modified, based on how many rounds/minute they fire. AR-15 w/bumpstock & hi cap mag is as deadly as true assault rifle? #GunControl
464 2018-03-15 19:58:38 The local "docent" teacher reckoned the ones near me were discarded pet stocks. People brought them up from S America and Mexico to sell on.
465 2018-03-15 19:58:16 Fair enough. I don't buy social media stocks, so I wouldn't really know.
466 2018-03-15 19:56:24 That’s a tautology and idiotic. Everyone is law abiding until they aren’t. Maybe we should evaluate and license to make sure those people who get guns aren’t the type who shoot up a school or their girlfriend. Maybe we outlaw bump-stocks so if we are wrong 30 people don’t die.

468 2018-03-15 19:55:45 been lots of fun, seen and toyed with some big ones this week. had a few stocks this week I saw double + in price right before my eyes while many made 10-50K
469 2018-03-15 19:55:43 Agreed, bump stocks had nothing to do with this latest shooting. But that’s a logical step to take. This is a messy issue with a lot of different things to consider, and I don’t have a solution to fix it all. I’m just frustrated that this continues to happen
470 2018-03-15 19:55:31 The market could have closed strong and didnt, not a great sign going into tomorrow. Overall i am optimistic, holding $SVXY long, but bought some $UVXY overnight. at 14.63. Just a hedge.

People who are interested shall decode themselves .No spoon-feeding
483 2018-03-15 19:51:03 So bump stocks make sense to talk about. Though that wouldn’t have prevented this shooting at all. But so far we haven’t reduced school shootings yet.
484 2018-03-15 19:50:52 Stocks don't always trade is a channel.

486 2018-03-15 19:50:03 @grassosteve Market is up 40% since Trump went to the White House for a 15% bump in profits. Trump in the white house was bullish for stocks last year. At today's prices, profits from Trump admin are priced in.

492 2018-03-15 19:49:07 Lets also not forget Vegas. No school bullying there. We don't even know why. He amassed an arsenal from gun shows. Background chks will mean nothing if I can still go to a gun show and not even show an ID. Need to decrease rate of fire also ie bump stocks & high cap mags!!

496 2018-03-15 19:44:15 The age needs to be bumped up to 25 and a better screening process is needed. Along with you need to be mentally stable and checked on tiem by time if you own a gun. Bump-stocks need to get banned as well.

You think your average millennial holds stocks or rich powerful white men dumped the stock because of these tweets who aren’t millennials. Go ahead and fill your social media with inactive old people.

501 2018-03-15 19:42:12 A few portfolio changes from this week:

In my main portfolio, I sold SNX & added to CRL as I continue a gentle reduction in the number of stocks I have an interest in.

Bought back into GAW today via a SB & managed to get the majority of todays SP rise ahead of FTSE250 promotion

503 2018-03-15 19:41:43 I'm a dog lover who likes this bill BUT a lot of American's are wondering where the bills are for gun background checks, banning assault weapons, banning bump stocks and keeping guns away from the mentally imbalanced.

512 2018-03-15 19:39:02 We have over 10000 guns laws. Not sure how many automobile laws there are. Yes, the President has suggested common sense laws like mental health screening, banning bump stocks, and most importantly the police needing to act when a dangerous person is on their radar!

518 2018-03-15 19:35:06 Britain is framing Russia for the nerve gas attacks. In past decades, many Russian spies were poisoned in Britain! At the same time offering work visas to rich Russian oligarchs who invested 750,000 or more in stocks and bonds. For the past couple of years, oligarchs pulling out.
519 2018-03-15 19:34:42 is the absence of bump stocks from far cry 5 a violation of the second amendment?

Well, he looked like a dictator 2 me when he signed an ORDER 2 Sessions 2 ban bump stocks doing so without a vote, this sets precedent! Did it 4 nothing, bump firing can b done w a belt, rubber band

546 2018-03-15 19:20:46 Banning bump stocks sets a dangerous precedent of banning firearm accessories in general. I agree they're not necessarily good to be sold, but I know why the NRA can't support banning them.
547 2018-03-15 19:20:42 Ban assault rifles bump stocks and high capacity magazines now, today covefe
548 2018-03-15 19:20:19 Well...last month Kylie caused Snapchat's stocks to pummeled. Today Rihanna dragged what was left of it. I guess I should probably give up on Scott making a comeback on it.

551 2018-03-15 19:19:07 There was a bill to ban bump stocks after the Last Vegas shooting that didn't pass. Democrats want to reinstate the assault weapons ban, but that won't pass (it actually failed at the state level in Florida). Democrats have made the effort. It's ridiculous to claim they haven't.
552 2018-03-15 19:17:08 Pot stocks are not doing well of late
553 2018-03-15 19:16:32 Good for @BernieSanders for getting onboard at last. Maybe now he will put some votes where his mouth is and vote in favor of sensible legislation like banning bump stocks and expanding background checks instead of continuing his shamefully pro-gun lobby past record.
554 2018-03-15 19:16:21 Tell him to sell all his stocks on the way out the door.

617 2018-03-15 18:51:11 You made my point there. In order for banning bump stocks to be worth anything, it has to actually accomplish something. With that deal, it wouldn't. Ok, what about licensing (without a fee) or restricting machine gun sales to those 21 & up in exchange for the repeal?

As a gun owner/pro 2A advocate listening BS facts spewed out blows me away! 28 school shootings since 2018! Bump stocks allow you to shoot 1000s of rounds per minute! Idiots! Stop watching CNN!
622 2018-03-15 18:49:01 Where’s you outage that they don’t want to stand up to the @NRA and have tougher gun laws, ban assault rifles and bump stocks?
623 2018-03-15 18:48:49 My stocks are hounding me. Grrr
624 2018-03-15 18:48:28 Yup. He starts raiding military surplus stores and stocks up on MRE's but it's just not enough. His body is suffering and he can't stop it- he's achy and his stomach feels like it's been on fire for years.

Even if he could get fresh food- where would he prep it? He has no home.
625 2018-03-15 18:47:58 Where’s the outrage over Trump not banning assault weapons and bump stocks?
626 2018-03-15 18:46:15 I hear what you're saying, but this will hurt people of every group. Except the 2%, who when they crash the economy again, will get a bailout. Then they'll buy up stocks and real estate on the cheap, rinse and repeat.

628 2018-03-15 18:45:06 The Hughes act is what led to bump stocks being created. Since the only crimes committed with legally owned machine guns have been by law enforcement there really is no compelling reason not to repeal it.

632 2018-03-15 18:44:08 My watchlist of Mometum stocks acquired through my custom made screener grew significantly today, indicating a lot of stocks are coming out of sound bases with healthy volume. Just a hunch, we could see a short term explosive move in coming days. I could be wrong as well.

635 2018-03-15 18:43:32 My G.. It works both ways if you can check it nicely. How so? If his parents fund him and he stocks up those Mo Faya's that money might open a few closed doors.
636 2018-03-15 18:43:22 Know the difference between an M16 and an AR-15 in semi auto fire? None. Auto fire? You know bump stocks? YouTube bump stocks. Also, there are ways to modify your AR-15’s receiver to make it full auto. 

Arguing semantics on this issue is why nothing will change in the US.

641 2018-03-15 18:41:29 Am not so familiar with macroeconomics, but when it comes to stocks, I analyze them with equity and related, more basic information. One thing to mention, when I predict future once, GS price surged 0.5%.
642 2018-03-15 18:40:47 I m perplexed that think its hydro stocks will boom here! So naive. At least as long as conditions are as of today!

Exmaple #426 was selling Take Two at $17.50, then watching them go up to $110 over the next few years. *sigh*

653 2018-03-15 18:34:49 3/ repealing the Hughes Act (which by the way would make the entire reasoning for banning bump stocks almost obsolete) isn't an option. However, amending it in certain places to address the abuse of it could be.

655 2018-03-15 18:33:16 I'm not saying that Congress needs the support of the NRA to ban bump stocks, just that they admitted it doesn't violate our 2nd amendment to do so.
656 2018-03-15 18:33:09 Absolutely. I was just at Stocks and Blondes watching grown men jump around and yell knowing this is the only time of the year they care about college basketball.

666 2018-03-15 18:30:25 There is no "correct correlation" between treasuries and stocks.  Sometimes they move in tandem, and sometimes they move in opposite directions. Yields have been going down for 36 years, but there is no law saying that will continue.

673 2018-03-15 18:28:02 Bump stocks were not even used in this case.  We need to fix the breakdowns in the system not implement even more restrictions on law abiding citizens
674 2018-03-15 18:27:11 I guess so, I'm just dissatisfied with the lack of progress.

We can't even ban bump stocks after Vegas, a totally unnecessary accessory that Reagan would have banned, and I'm concerned that Parkland will be pushed aside as the media moves on.
675 2018-03-15 18:26:02 Would an act of Congress banning certain types of semi-auto rifles, handgun modifications, bump stocks and limiting magazine capacities pass constitutional muster?

680 2018-03-15 18:22:04 Why cant we just make a bill to ban bump stocks? Why do you just promote that part of the bill and not the rest? Why aren't people who know anything about fire arms, fire arm saftey, or the real stats making these bills? This is a whole lot of bandwagoning and nonsence.

688 2018-03-15 18:16:20 Short call spreads & long put spreads are both bearish. U can let a successful call spread expire (save on fees) but you need to sell (to close) a successful long put spread (pay fees). Which do you prefer? #options #stocks #trading #investing #bitcoin $SPY $SPX

719 2018-03-15 18:05:44 What ever happened to banning bump stocks? What ever happened to that one because I’m sure a lot of people want to know what your doing about that! Let me refresh: they turn a semi into a full automatic weapon (Las Vegas), how about banning all semiautomatics!!
720 2018-03-15 18:05:31 @pmarca Hi Marc, are you guys interested in funding only tech stocks or other industries as well.
721 2018-03-15 18:04:52 So we’ve now agreed on three of my gun reform ideas

729 2018-03-15 18:01:38 Good, then we can agree that there is a middle road. AR’s yes, bump stocks “no”. What can we do about the illegal guns sold to criminals. So many shootings from that group.

733 2018-03-15 18:00:42 yeah and did the nra say they didn't want background checks or to ban bump stocks.? nope. -.- lol so what's your point
734 2018-03-15 18:00:36 Yes. I just wish they still allowed short selling of CE stocks or had at least communicated better.
735 2018-03-15 18:00:35 My stocks are down
736 2018-03-15 18:00:05 Again, I've repeatedly mentioned having zero issue with raising age to purchase, and banning bump stocks. And yet, you act like I'm saying we should give guns to everyone age 2+. But it hasn't reduced problems in the past in any measurable way (as with '94 ban).
737 2018-03-15 17:59:48 But you’re not introducing background checks are you you’re saying individual states can decide? And bump stocks are still in aren’t they? So what have you actually donr except put more guns in schools and expect teachers to become killers? #YouAreAnNRATraitor #ImpeachTrumpNow
738 2018-03-15 17:59:44 I wonder how much their stocks are going to fall now

744 2018-03-15 17:56:29 How about nickel as from 2023 onward ? Seems the stocks are running out by then and no new supply in the pipeline.
745 2018-03-15 17:56:21 "Well-regulated" means well trained in the use of firearms. The NRA supported instant b/g checks. My position on bump-stocks is they were clearly designed to bypass restrictions on auto-fire firearms. No-fly is a "secret" list. Mental health I agree, but there are privacy issues.

753 2018-03-15 17:53:34 @AppStoreLille c'est quand même scandaleux d'acheter un iPhone 6S a 850€ et de se retrouver avec un téléphone inopérant ! En plus après passage en boutique je dois prendre rdv et appeler moi-même pour connaître les stocks de batterie pour remplacement ! C'est le comble ! 
754 2018-03-15 17:53:24 You're correct on the bump stocks. They aren't the big problem, just a piece of it. The only thing that will cut down on gun crimes in our country is to ban assault weapons. There is no sane reason for any citizen to own one. Period.
755 2018-03-15 17:52:53 There should be NO BAN on assault weapons.  That would violate our 2nd Amendment rights.  There should be a ban on bump stocks and we should place armed response in our schools to protect children.  Don't threaten our 2nd Amendment rights.  You will be voted out of office.
756 2018-03-15 17:52:34 not good for me I hold some of those dividend stocks
757 2018-03-15 17:52:07 .@JeffFlake on gun control @PressClubDC:  is for common sense rules.  Change the age for gun purchases to 21 and no bump stocks.   On the question of first amendment:  when @realDonaldTrump calls the press the enemy of the people, legislators need to stand up.
758 2018-03-15 17:51:57 But Trump signed legislation undoing what Pres Obama had done, making it harder for ppl w/mental illness to purchase guns, so is he now agreeing w/Pres Obama?

Why does Congress have 2 have the NRA's support 2 eliminate bump stocks? My taxes don't pay the NRA

812 2018-03-15 17:29:57 Honestly? Bump stocks are a red herring. Seriously. You can use a rubber band to do the same thing as a bumpstock, but for $.07, not $240.

815 2018-03-15 17:28:45 What we can focus is on valuations of individual stocks. And leave the rest to Mr Market. In long run, properly picked stocks get their due. As earnings is what matters.
816 2018-03-15 17:28:38 Only reasonable justification for no LTCG on stocks is that higher equity valuations make it easier for businesses to raise money. Good but flip side is it encourages creation of bubbles.

Would appreciate it if you can provide us with the deadline thanks in advance
818 2018-03-15 17:27:59 Banning assault weapons (not currently on the books) and eliminating bump stocks. This does not ban guns.  Nor does raising the age limit.  Background checking is not as good as it should be. If you are a law abiding adult you will still be able to own guns,
819 2018-03-15 17:27:18 When I buy #crypto or #stocks , it is because I believe in the #value of the #project over a long term - I do not buy on #price alone - but if I believe the value is there and the price is lower - why not? $LTC $ADA $XLM $AMAZ $CRSP $SQ - I believe all of these will #win

821 2018-03-15 17:26:41 Our citizens deserve to hear from their elected representatives on possible solutions to curb gun violence. Banning bump stocks and enacting gun violence restraining orders are just two examples of bills that we could pass today that would have a major impact.
822 2018-03-15 17:26:01 Got an email today tryna tell me that I should invest marijuana stocks lol
823 2018-03-15 17:25:34 So that way they can keep selling semi-automatic assualt rifles with bump stocks. They don’t want them banned or restricted because it hurts gun manufacturers profits. If you don’t believe me the head of the NRA is a CEO of a gun manufacturing company.
824 2018-03-15 17:25:24 May be hard to read too much into TNX IF stocks sell off from here. Somewhat lower rates could just indicate a rotation to debt.

831 2018-03-15 17:22:30 If you can't use it to aim at a target, it is not an "arm." It is a toy.

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

871 2018-03-15 17:09:01 Thank Emma!  Guns can, are, and must be strictly regulated.  Machine guns are regulated.  AR-15s with bump stocks and high capacity magazines are made to mimic machine guns.  If assault type weapons cannot be strictly regulated, they must be banned.

882 2018-03-15 17:06:03 I can also list lots of other things like how many die falling off ladders but that still doesn’t take away from we don’t need ARs and bump stocks on our streets

You guys seem like loons &ghouls / brainwashed as a cult over this issue and the rest of sane America has had enough

911 2018-03-15 16:57:32 So the bump stock ban doesn’t actually ban bump stocks. I guess it doesn’t even have the word bump stock in it? Wow. So if this shit passes 90% of people who own almost any modded rifle will be considered a felon. Well guys get ready for a civil war lol.

933 2018-03-15 16:44:39 “Assault weapons” bans are pointless. California has one, yet you can still buy an AR15, AK47, or Steyr Aug here. How? Because they ban guns according to features. Pistol grips, bayonet lugs and thumbhole stocks don’t effect how a gun fires.
934 2018-03-15 16:44:24 Next time they update Fortnite they should put bump stocks in the game

945 2018-03-15 16:38:52 Sensible gun control already exists. Sure strengthen background checks (Govt Agencies still have to do their jobs) and ban bump stocks (FYI you can bump fire without a bump stock but wouldn’t be able to aim). Not sure what more legislation truly accomplishes

971 2018-03-15 16:31:14 I don’t have any problem with people buying an individual company’s stock, but you have to 1) be prepared for losses, 2) be smart about it (penny stocks are a no) and 3) don’t approach it as a short term thing. By all means, buy Apple, but don’t touch it for several years.
972 2018-03-15 16:31:06 Do you know how stocks work?
973 2018-03-15 16:31:04 Yes it is long overdue. How much did you and Oafbama  do? He was very good with fake elephant tears, but he did NOTHING! Oh except pass legislation that made bump stocks legal.
974 2018-03-15 16:30:46 Some of it being tested there, 30 years ago, prior to the fall of the USSR is a world away from a totally evidence-free account of acquisition post-USSR of stocks not reported to be there at the time. Notably even Russia hasn't tried to use this excuse.

976 2018-03-15 16:30:37 Fuck, am I into stocks now?
977 2018-03-15 16:30:08 I really cannot find a scenario where stocks break down into a bear market yet. Maybe we see some near term volatility, but stocks are still more likely to make new highs before completing a topping process. $SPX
978 2018-03-15 16:29:37 People shouldn’t buy individual stocks unless it’s their job, they work in the industry they’re buying, or they don’t care about losing the money

980 2018-03-15 16:29:01 Yeah, this isn’t true. Try again. Republicans proposed legislation after #October1 in Vegas, including banning bump stocks, and the Dems wouldn’t hear it because it didn’t do enough.

983 2018-03-15 16:28:17 an automatic weapon is one that continuously fires as long as you're holding the trigger and bump stocks simulate a fully automatic weapon. Both of these make it convenient for people with motivation to kill a large number of people with convenience.

988 2018-03-15 16:26:25 No you asshole people will get shot by illegal guns. Ban assault weapons & bump stocks. In regards to drugs what you did was take legal opioids away from patients that desperately need them. Illicit drugs are still running rampant. Because CDC lumped all drug deaths together.
989 2018-03-15 16:25:35 When African industrialists build companies, & want to float their stocks, they shouldn't feel the obligation to float stocks on the JSE. Africans have nothing in common with those who own & control the JSE. I'd rather list on the TSX (Toronto), NSE (Nairobi), or Lagos.

1007 2018-03-15 16:19:37 A small, terribly underfunded effort. Thank you, but you are NOT done. Bump stocks and anything similar. Large ammo clips. Hollow-points. Teflon coated bullets. Silencers. All have to go. Not for general use! #NeverAgain

1011 2018-03-15 16:17:52 The equity market sustained the bearish momentum, resulting in a depreciation in the NSE ASI of 1.53%. The sustained sell pressure particularly in banking sector stocks resulted in a number of stocks on offer.
1012 2018-03-15 16:17:49 3 QUOTES from the Winklevoss speech yesterday 

US government is as much an experiment as bitcoin. 

Smart criminals are in USD. Bitcoin is too open.

Not having crypto exposure in yr portfolio will be like not having exposure to FANG stocks

1018 2018-03-15 16:16:45 - Russia did not register Novichok (8x deadlier as VX) until the early 90s
- 2017, Russia destroyed its stocks (all and why now?) It has produced many tons of it!
- it´s too complicated to reproduce (non-states)
- Isotope studies can verify the origin
- UK was weak for too long

“enact a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons, ammunition magazines in excess of ten rounds, and modifications that simulate automated fire such as bump stocks and trigger cranks, AND CHEAP HANDGUNS & CHEAP AMMUNITION; and declaring an emergency”

Out of your mind.
1025 2018-03-15 16:15:18 Bump stocks are a gimmick there are lots of things that don’t even have to attach to a gun to change fire rate. Mentally ill people already shouldn’t be able to buy weapons so I agree with you there 100%

1033 2018-03-15 16:12:22 Liar. Canada had a higher economic growth than the US in 2017, and the IMF has said the tax cuts will only have short and narrow benefits. Tariffs will hurt both Canada and the US. History shows this, and the economists agree (hence why the announcement crashed the stocks).
1034 2018-03-15 16:11:40 media's talking about semiconductor's stocks going up, but numbers just proof the opposite...

1039 2018-03-15 16:10:01 Omaha's newspaper used to be employee-owned.

IIRC, most the Omaha stocks were owned by older employees reaching retirement age, and the company sold to Buffett bc of concerns of the cost of buying out retiring employees ' stocks.

1054 2018-03-15 16:04:07 The information the author presents is not up to date and the likelihood is scientists have advanced their knowledge since 2016. Now look at the Russian response.

The bulls wins, the bears wins, 
But it's the pigs which gets slaughtered

1115 2018-03-15 15:42:16 There is a rational reason for this. The young progressives historically don't vote (especially in congressional elections). Wall St and those who have something to gain from Wall St (people who own stocks) vote. Congress represents the interest of voters.

1137 2018-03-15 15:31:50 In natural disaster situations where emergency personnel cannot reach & looting and raping abound, semi autos would be very effective for protection. Bump stocks are a novelty & make accuracy worse -you're good at picking up buzz word talking points

1139 2018-03-15 15:31:26 The over all take away is to look inside the market to see why it's doing what it is and finding sectors that may be stronger than others. Then look for individual stocks in those sectors.

1159 2018-03-15 15:25:08 OTC stocks can easily be pushed around, you must know this when you own. People attack / pump them to drive price up or down.

1161 2018-03-15 15:24:10 I agree that Mike Brown is tight with his money, but why would any free agent want to come to a franchise who has kept a coach for 17 years with zero playoff wins. Outside of Cleveland, Cincinnati is one of the biggest laughing stocks of the NFL.
1162 2018-03-15 15:23:40 Stocks usually going up seems clean to me.
1163 2018-03-15 15:23:17 I don't own stocks, but I'm well enough otherwise. And given that all the measures put in place after 2008's market crash were voted away during a period where we're winding up a trade war with a larger, more stable economy, you couldn't get me into stocks now.

By removing the recourse to take them to court for their marketing, their lobbying to keep dangerous weapons (high capacity magazines & bump stocks, both *technically* legal) available and accessible to kids, the bill set us back.

1215 2018-03-15 15:07:21 Maybe the market is predicting these buyback stocks well in advance;  So, it's a Buy on the Buyback Rumor, Sell on the Buyback News?  Most good investment ideas, speculation on my part, once they're publicly out, don't outperform the index.  Knowing something special gets harder.

1251 2018-03-15 14:53:44 What that graph shows is that if you had the capital to be able to sit on your investments for years, then it was a fine time to buy stocks. That has nearly always been the case.
1252 2018-03-15 14:53:36 And yes close to 60% of the fund is invested in stocks that each individually have <1% weight in SWIX, with 35% of that in stocks <0.5% individual weight in SWIX. We are mainly a mid cap value fund. If you want index or “active” benchmark huggers you know where to go.

1268 2018-03-15 14:45:53 Ar-15 are not rapid fire, it's like any other rifle, or pistol - one bullet per trigger pull, that's why they're banning bump stocks as they should.  Unfortunately a lot of people confuse military vs civilian rifles.

1271 2018-03-15 14:45:06 Nothing in this plan addresses the concerns raised by students. It won't strengthen background checks, ban bump stocks or reinstate waiting periods.
1272 2018-03-15 14:44:22 Amazing how over the past six weeks algos have refused to allow stocks to have a follow through day after a big day. Today's examples are $TWTR & $PYPL.
1273 2018-03-15 14:44:03 @bigbean I bought GDX Puts instead. We are closer to getting a daily cycle low in stocks next week or a couple of weeks.
1274 2018-03-15 14:43:34 It would be great if it ended there, but it doesn't. They then use those dollars to buy things, like goods, services, stocks, and bonds. Oh hey, that's good too!
1275 2018-03-15 14:43:30 There's never a time to talk gun control with you ammosexuals, is there? Nobody, except extremists, wants a total gun ban. That's idiocy. What's being asked is reasonable gun control, like better vetting, waiting periods, limits on mags and bump stocks. So when is a good time?
1276 2018-03-15 14:43:11 So now you’re going from workers to business owners. Yes, small business owners should have gotten more cuts - all I am saying is that workers do benefit from the corporate cuts. 4+ million got $1000+ bonuses, 90% are getting a larger paycheck, most benefit from stocks/401k’s.

1282 2018-03-15 14:40:44 interesting ...can Put buyers use the predictable decline to their advantage, particularly for high yielding dividend stocks o etfs?
1283 2018-03-15 14:40:27 Wonder if Russian 'support' would offset the outrage from Spanish & Argentine Fisheries groups who would see their livelihoods reduced by yet another nation intruding in their waters? I'm sure they'd be thrilled at having to compete for scarce stocks?

1289 2018-03-15 14:38:50 Q: Why do I use Google Trends for my DD on OTC stocks? 
A: Because a rise in the interest on a stock almost always directly correlates to a rise in pps. If the price hasn’t crashed, you can trust this to show a rise in potential investors. If it crashed it could just be gawkers.
1290 2018-03-15 14:38:50 $RKDA $DXR are two stocks where you do NOT want to take advice from anyone about their RES/SUPP or where to buy or not... unless you have a mentor with skills. This is just going to do what it will. #NOREALREADS

1296 2018-03-15 14:36:57 Oh, I think the support gun control. Eliminate the sale of assault weapons, bump stocks, no sale of guns to anyone under 21, better background checks and please don't arm teachers.  Fewer guns, not more guns.  Look at Australia. These kids will be voting soon.

1298 2018-03-15 14:36:05 All this trade war stuff is just another brick in the wall of worries that this market likes to climb so furiously. The last correction happened w/o a clear and obvious catalyst as markets rarely correct on obvious and expected worries. #stocks #NASDAQ #NYSE
1299 2018-03-15 14:35:49 Anyway No, RINO's too. Nobody wanted this to happen I hope you understand that. I'd of preferred the FBI taken the threat seriously before the shooting, I wished that officer would have ran in the school, he was told not to. Trump sugg. raising age 21, and no bump stocks
1300 2018-03-15 14:35:17 He called for banning bump stocks and lifting the ban on gun violence research. So I suppose Phillips has the assault weapons ban going for him.
1301 2018-03-15 14:32:48 "Free" stuff like their lives. I support the young Americans in their search of reasonable gun laws: background checks, limits on magazine cap, restricting bump stocks, raising the age to buy guns & restricting access to automatic & semi automatic weapons to our military & police
1302 2018-03-15 14:32:28 On Fox Biz News today @ 12:25. Tune in. Stocks are struggling to break through 2,800 but near-term support can be found around 2,750. Overall, equities remain poised to advance predicated upon supportive fundamentals.

1310 2018-03-15 14:24:51 How about something simple. Like outlaw bump stocks and raising the age to 21 for buying assault rifles and making background checks more stringent.  Then funding mental health care.
1311 2018-03-15 14:24:27 This is just like the economist in fall 1929 who said that stocks were too low, and anyone worried about the overheated economy was anti-American. That went well....

Someone needs to tell me why anyone outside of the police or military need assault weapons.  What are they assaulting DEER?  Get them off the market along with the bump stocks.
1371 2018-03-15 14:00:29 You got your pinky toe in the water. Now something meaningful for the country. Universal background checks. Ban bump stocks. Waiting periods for purchase. Limit magazines to 10 rounds. People on no fly list shouldn’t be able to purchase.

1385 2018-03-15 13:56:45 The stock market has rallied in response to President Trump's intentions and actions and he shouldn't let Wall Street whining change his game plan.  If there must be some pressure on stocks near term so be it- time to play to win long term.
1386 2018-03-15 13:56:44 rescind Tiahrt & Dickey, ban bump stocks - none of those would impact you if you’re legit. An assault weapons ban is already judged constitutional, and leaves you MANY firearm options. Sounds like you’re the one being emotional.

1390 2018-03-15 13:55:09 1) It's a gun issue. The worst mass shootings recently have been committed with an AR-15 platform semiautomatic rifle, one with bump stocks (Vegas), the rest without. That shooter MAY have been crazy, but undiagnosed.

1392 2018-03-15 13:54:04 I was speaking about Copaxone being a biosimilar not a generic. He brought up generics. I highly doubt in this population once stable that insurance, MDs, PBMs etc will try to force a switch. Why competitor stocks are valued so low imho.
1393 2018-03-15 13:54:04 The "trade deficit with China" is a good example of things that people should not rant about. The $$ China makes it invests in US stocks and bonds - specifically treasuries. Those $$ go into US social security/medicaid/IRAs because the money comes back to USG.
1394 2018-03-15 13:53:01 Stocks Mr. President - Our 401Ks are sinking! Need votes for Mid Terms and R-eelection... Economy must be reflecting positive in our 401Ks!
1395 2018-03-15 13:53:00 They'll not comply because they can't. Novichock was created in Kurdistan and the US, UK & China took control of those stocks when the old soviet union fell. That is an historical fact look it up. The building then went on to produce chemicals 4 industry but went bankrupt later.
1396 2018-03-15 13:52:42 $SMRT - +163%!!! Told you guys this play was a sleeper and was going to recover.

1399 2018-03-15 13:50:52 But in real estate, for instance—1031 exchanges are not taxable. No similar shelter for stocks or currencies?
1400 2018-03-15 13:50:39 US stocks opening a little higher Nasdaq unchanged. S&P up a touch. Dow doing better
The major stock indices are opening a little higher.
In the US debt markets yields are trading near unchanged levels
1401 2018-03-15 13:48:21 $LIBE 0.0280 Great entry point methinks! 0.04+ shortly!
1402 2018-03-15 13:48:08 They did nothing. There is no alteration to the 2nd amendment regarding the age a person can buy a gun, bump stocks or military weapons. So, the wasted tax payer time & money again.
1403 2018-03-15 13:47:50 Hey the swings on this bear market are pretty easy to profit from too. And I don't have to scan the whole market just to find something worth tradin like in stocks. Trading nothing but Litecoin is enough for my wallet lol.
1404 2018-03-15 13:47:39 $SMRT has been a huge pick for me the last week or so, fundamentals are strong! @StocksToTrade #Stocks

1406 2018-03-15 13:45:37 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to cure your phantom limb syndrome
1407 2018-03-15 13:45:29 @manukumarjain  Note 5 pro sale seems to be forge.. I tried to buy it since launch but within 2 seconds it out of stocks.. easily u can buy it from reseller on a premium of 2k... Seriously thinking to move to purchase another brand phone
1408 2018-03-15 13:45:23 This is great, can you but a rider on it that covers bump stocks? Twofer?
1409 2018-03-15 13:45:09 bump stocks aren't the issue, it's Military style weaponry , they need to banned, hard sell but that's it..
1410 2018-03-15 13:44:03 This is great! And, today would be a good day for @TIAA to divest itself of all gun stocks.
1411 2018-03-15 13:43:28 Share something please on allocation of capital.Should we allocate equally to everything we like or on what basis should we decide capital allocation to stocks?
1412 2018-03-15 13:42:19 Haha the claytrader curse. It is either you destroying stocks or ihub or bashers and shorters but never the toxic notes and pumpers they are all innocent
1413 2018-03-15 13:41:56 But am I wrong to think that so long as proceeds of a similar sale of stock are promptly put into a new investment, there's no gain? E.g., if I swap stocks in my Vanguard account there's no taxable event, right? What makes this different?
1414 2018-03-15 13:41:52 S&P 500, Dow try to halt 3-session skid, as trade-war fears linger, stocks have mixed open today
1415 2018-03-15 13:41:35 I don't think Charizard goes -3 with Rosa, he deletes Luma too easy and kills her so early most stocks. He struggles to land, but multi jumps, armour and a fast forward air all help him get down. Ledge is hell though, but not -3 hell.

Corrin is -3 though ban that MU
1416 2018-03-15 13:41:23 .@whitehouse I agree with @gunowners that if you ban bump stocks administratively, then your successor can use this to also outlaw match triggers, magazines & more--using the argument they also "accelerate" the fire of a gun. Instead, insist on clean reciprocity!
1417 2018-03-15 13:41:20 Grow some cojones raise age limit magazines ban High Velocity rounds bump stocks, any mechanism that turns semi-automatic weaponto auto. if you're not a fraidee cat

1418 2018-03-15 13:40:16 You are lying again!!!  Maybe you should get the facts from your Commerce Department. ICYMI, hundreds of thousands of kids marched through Americas streets yesterday.  Where is the ban on bump stocks; where is any policy to resolve this national crisis?  #NeverAgain
1419 2018-03-15 13:39:00 Bump stocks and assault rifles are not necessary for home defense or hunting. We believe in a better future where Americans will be safe from these dangerous weapons and young people will not be brutally killed in our schools.

1423 2018-03-15 13:38:06 The irony is, by exercising their First Amendment right, you're telling them they'll never have an effect on the Second Amendment.There were laws in place that weren't followed allowing this to happen. Maybe outlawing bump stocks, magazine limits and background checks will help.
1424 2018-03-15 13:37:58 No, bump stocks do not turn semi into full auto. That difference is a mechanical difference inside the rifle. Not a bolt on.
1425 2018-03-15 13:37:57 But isn't that also pretty typical?  Things are great, stocks are up, vol is low...OMG WTF just happened, why are stocks down so much...NM, things are great...
1426 2018-03-15 13:37:33 Internet was out few hours yesterday and cable guy (very nice person) came about hour after it came back by itself, checked everything out, pronounced it "all ok", and then chatted up stocks. We are in a Bubble. Going Cashy at Open. S&P 2750 tests

1431 2018-03-15 13:35:20 STOCKS,,,A BAD BET?:  BIG need to borrow almost $500 billion in first 3 mos of 2018 plus possible trade war with China, our lender, makes owning stocks now a bad bet.

1436 2018-03-15 13:34:07 How nany times have numb stocks been used in a crime? How many full auto used in a crime? Do you realize you can use a belt loop and a finger to simulate full auto? Which of those should be banned?
1437 2018-03-15 13:33:32 From a man who justified not banning bump stocks after Las Vegas by saying you can't legislate against evil.

1440 2018-03-15 13:33:05 Thank you for calling him out. This space (crypto, gold, stocks) is full of so many con artists. I’m convinced over 80% of retail gold & silver sales are a direct result of these type of fear tactics. 2008 did a number on the American psyche and Guys like him take advantage of it
1441 2018-03-15 13:32:55 Today in 1933, the @NYSE re-opens after closing for 2 weeks during FDR's bank holiday.  The Dow leaps to its biggest one-day percentage gain on record, 15.3%.  Stocks were trading at 10x projected earnings, .65X book value and had a dividend yield of 8.7%.
1442 2018-03-15 13:32:54 Excellent information! At the risk of questioning the duckiness of a duck, other than Russia, would you know (or suspect) which countries have stocks of Novichok or have made it? How would one apply it to a surface to poison someone without any risk to themself? 
1443 2018-03-15 13:32:48 When sentiment is this awful in a market (#bitcoin, stocks,), we tend to see "FIRE, ready, aim"--meaning, bitcoin is vulnerable to selloff on negative headlines.  Technicals also not strong.  Does not change positive med. or long-term picture.  Patience needed... and perspective.
1444 2018-03-15 13:31:15 Typical ... hedge fund managers who've good either short the name here or double down on the long. Otherwise just another dude talking stocks.
1445 2018-03-15 13:28:54 I'm rich, you know what I'm going to do with the extra tax money? nothing maybe buy more stocks.
1446 2018-03-15 13:28:40 #Marketupdate March 15, 2018 - S&P and NASDAQ are sitting on their 6 day ma while DOW is lagging and looks to trigger on A6 a Sell but this can be a setup to squeeze shorts. Note  S&P is scanning on A6 bias to the buy side. Chinese stocks all moving higher premarket.
1447 2018-03-15 13:28:15 How about instead they move ahead with ERPO bill, more protections against abusers keeping weapons, banning bump stocks???  Make it happen NYS...

1451 2018-03-15 13:25:37 I am a complete idiot when it comes to tax. What about this series of events (if anything) makes it diff from trading stocks? If he invested $7k in mutual fund that grew to $120k, he sold and bought new fund that drops to $30k, he'd have no tax liability, right? Unrealized gains?
1452 2018-03-15 13:24:33 One. That's fucking dumb. Pills didn't make that guy build an arsenal, bump stocks and the current Administration allows for mentally unstable people to purchase guns. What's the drug?
1453 2018-03-15 13:24:31 Hard to trade a protectionist theme when stocks dont care
1454 2018-03-15 13:24:30 So much competition around in the bowling stocks. Batting probably less so. They did bring Ackerman and Roelofsen to the coast to help out.
1455 2018-03-15 13:24:05 @ToysRUs Tell your CEO to concentrate on Pizza, he doesn’t understand anything about toys, he only stocks the best selling toys during the year, forgetting about all else except at Christmas, if he would have kept all the toys in stock all of the year, they would not be closing!!

1459 2018-03-15 13:22:30 Don't go near gems and jewelry stocks in this environment. Banks and lenders are behind them, Ang people have started pouring money into MFs instead of precious metals
1460 2018-03-15 13:22:28 I do agree with you though, stricter gun laws will not keep criminals from having guns, but background checks, magazine limits, and even eliminating bump stocks could help
1461 2018-03-15 13:21:58 if we could trust them to act in good faith and compare any samples given to their stocks and report back honestly, I'd be all for it, but the fact their embassy twitter feed & press has been basically 'lol @ Britain' for the past week makes me think otherwise

1465 2018-03-15 13:20:10 Not sure what "may actually agree" means here.  Poll after poll after poll shows huge bipartisan support for universal background checks, waiting periods, banning high capacity magazines, bump stocks, assault rifles. What people agree on is no mystery.
1466 2018-03-15 13:20:03 Kudlow will argue for war against Iran or NK to boost DOW & specifically defense stocks. He called every single metric wrong immediately prior to the 2008 crash.
1467 2018-03-15 13:19:40 Warren Gatland still in love with growth stocks risk losing out on value
1468 2018-03-15 13:19:38 80% of Americans support banning semi automatic rifles, bump stocks, and expanded background checks. Congress is doing the same thing with gun control as CA is with sanctuary cities.

1473 2018-03-15 13:17:33 Brave Sen. John  Kennedy R-LA is quick to introduce a bill to protect pets on airlines.  Where’s his bill to protect kids from assault weapons with bump stocks?Remember 600 were shot in Las Vegas.

1480 2018-03-15 13:13:48 The SSVA is a joke.  It won't help.  Congress needs to pass a bill/law that bans AR-15s and similar guns, their ammunition, bump stocks, and raise the legal limit to buy a gun to 21.  NO armed teachers who might be killed by police.
1481 2018-03-15 13:13:48 Banning bump stocks is good. Define AR-15 type guns.

1484 2018-03-15 13:13:10 Duh. You make the argument for elimination of automatic weapons & bump stocks.  If these people had no access to all this weaponry, 100 people a day wouldn’t die.  
(I do like her hair though.)
1485 2018-03-15 13:12:51 While that legislation is a start , we need to expand background checks , ban all asssult type weapons  , ban bump stocks , raise the age to 21 to buy guns, limit ammunition to 10 rounds!
1486 2018-03-15 13:12:44 The assault weapons ban passed in the 90s was Constitutional...  as would be a ban on high capacity magazines, or a ban on bump stocks...

1490 2018-03-15 13:11:52 On the day the kids are marching to say they have had enough Rubio talks about daylight savings and not boom stocks , mental health, banning weapons of war???? This is the GOP. The party whores for the NRA
1491 2018-03-15 13:11:52 We were so excited that we ordered online. It turned out, there are still a lot of stocks... 
1492 2018-03-15 13:11:33 Hardly.  I grew up in a family in a rural area with guns for hunting, etc. I want better background checks & means to keep guns from those who should not have them. No bump stocks, etc. It should not be so easy to kill so many so quickly.
1493 2018-03-15 13:11:28 Thank you Janet!
1494 2018-03-15 13:10:56 Bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to function as automatic weapons, are legal in almost all states and have been used in multiple "legally undefined" mass shootings, including the Las Vegas shooting which killed 58 people last year.
1495 2018-03-15 13:10:38 And look at new talent producer job @HOME_mcr
1496 2018-03-15 13:10:33 Also I agree about the bump stocks no need for those ...... in my opinion.
1497 2018-03-15 13:09:09 Morning Market Update: stocks trade mixed amid China trade concerns as jobless claims fall.
1498 2018-03-15 13:08:47 At a gunshow you can buy any gun without having any of those things. The infamous "gunshow loophole" is a way to sidestep requirements.

Plus there are no strict limits on what is street-safe like with cars, as semi-automatic rifles and bump stocks are legal.

1506 2018-03-15 13:03:50 Because they'd have to repeal a bunch of other laws if they wanted to reintroduce stocks or public flogging as punishments for vagrancy, and the public outcry would be even worse. (I have no doubt they would if they thought they could get away with it.)

1515 2018-03-15 12:57:57 does this ban bump stocks,raises the age limit, bans assault rifles or any assault weapon. NRA WOULD BE PROUD
1516 2018-03-15 12:57:08 And in looking those vids up it appears bump stocks are going to be banned. However doing it by executive regulation will almost certainly be challenged leading to a delay in implementing the ban.

1518 2018-03-15 12:54:04 I’ve just watched 2 videos on homemade bump stocks & one with a 1st time BS user. I can see that until you figure out the mechanics of how to use it, it’s not intuitive, but once they’d got the hang of it, 30 and 40 round mags were emptied in seconds. Why would a ban be a joke?

1. No guns for the mentally ill
2. All guns must be registered
3. No fully auto guns outside of clubs or changes to them to make them so (bump stocks etc).

Then it’s just a majority vote.

1593 2018-03-15 12:14:11 yes, but that's not at all how any discussion goes with people giving advice

it goes as follows: "we can't have you in bonds, you can't live off of what they pay"

1638 2018-03-15 11:44:19 Not a specific criticism of Arcus. Too much fast money chasing IO stocks for glory, Michael. Doesn't end well.
1639 2018-03-15 11:43:51 Bump stocks? That's your action on guns? Why are you listening to political advisors and the NRA over USA children? Your job is to protect the homeland. We have a public health crisis and as our leader you are doing nothing. Failure. Sad. Kids mean more than guns!

1641 2018-03-15 11:43:23 There's always money for war - because it makes a profit. Clear out the old stocks of armaments and plenty of work upgrading the inventory. Plus glory for the PM. And everyone forgets the dismal domestic agenda.
1642 2018-03-15 11:43:22 If the components of Novichok are easy to make anywhere, they could easily be made in the Russian Federation, and the highly publicised final destruction of chemical weapons stocks in September 2017 doesn't count for much.
1643 2018-03-15 11:43:00 BTW.  Do you know of any sites that have pre-market data?  Hard to find.  Penny stocks especially hard.

1654 2018-03-15 11:38:07 Canadian Tax Planning - U.S. stocks are probably better to hold in your RRSPs than your TFSAs, because the IRS levies a withholding tax on U.S. stock dividends in your TFSAs, but not your RRSPs.
1655 2018-03-15 11:37:58 Banning assault style weapons, bump stocks and high capacity magazines ... better screening and background checks. These are things they’re asking for. As far as mental health, obviously we need better care. Please write your congressman

1658 2018-03-15 11:35:18 Stocks have been sent to WHQs and RHQs - hence the request for pragmatism and understanding.  Advice is to keep requesting the badges in the normal procedure and issuing them to the cadets as soon as possible.

1672 2018-03-15 11:21:05 @SpeakerRyan this is a start, not yet a bill.  It’s not sensible gun laws, banning bumb stocks, raising age limits.  Don’t spike the ball yet, you 1st and 90 yards to go.

1684 2018-03-15 11:14:08 Great bill! Glad @marcorubio is in the senate! How about if @marcorubio floats a bill to institute universal background checks for all guns, raise gun purchase age, ban assault style weapons and bump stocks, etc?
1685 2018-03-15 11:13:45 If it was sanctioned for production under the USSR and has little to no deterioration stocks could have been 'liberated' by criminal gangs during the fall of the Soviet Union (as many very nasty weapons were). Russian criminal gangs aren't exactly known for their morals.

Two completely different scenarios.
Iraq no WMD found.
Salisbury actual chemical weapons used.
Russia asked fie a sample to check and verify it came from THEIR stocks.
Ergo, Russia have chemical weapons designed for Chemical warfare and Corbyn refuses to condemn!
1696 2018-03-15 11:05:33 Assault weapons are illegal are you senile?  AR does not stand for assault rifle. Bump stocks should be illegal and everyone believes that so why not put that to a vote instead of being an obstructionist.
1697 2018-03-15 11:05:11 So either Putin directed it or Putin can’t control his stocks. Both are bad, one worse than the other. Then you look at motivations and form. There is no motive for any current terror group to target this man. There is for Putin. No one else has claimed it - they would if a group

1699 2018-03-15 11:03:17 So. What exactly do bump stocks do? And what is an #assaultweapon exactly? “Barring dangerous individuals from having guns” is useless rhetoric like “stop bad people from doing bad things.” 21 to exercise constitutional rights—a joke. I’m good with Heavy background checks though.

1759 2018-03-15 10:11:09 excellent strategy  “One should look for stocks where 30 to 40 per cent growth is visible. Then wait for them to correct 20 to 30 per cent. This will happen once every six to eight months. Get into then. The strategy looks simple, but very hard to implement,”

2021 2018-03-15 06:11:43 Let's raise the stocks with B...S...
2022 2018-03-15 06:10:44 False, the government does not use AR-15s. They use other rifles. Sorry. Also I am all for a ban on bump stocks. However, I don't think it will do that much though. I have used them and they are effective. On the flip side I have also used a gun without a bump stock....
2023 2018-03-15 06:10:29 So your pretense of ignorance is not helping you, it makes your opinion appear uneducated, and your pretense of denial is not helping you, the bump stocks allow semi-auto weapons to fire at near-full-auto speeds, which most people realize means they must be made illegal.
2024 2018-03-15 06:08:45 majority of those jumping on the crypto bandwagon would have done nothing more than see some make a good coin out of it.. General stocks and bonds trading has been monitored for bull and bears since forever ago.. anyone who doesn't know how to read market may as well burn their $
2025 2018-03-15 06:08:36 Of all stocks, a long on $AVZ saved me from losing heaps today! lol
2026 2018-03-15 06:07:34 I just do not know why you need weapons such as the AR15 or those thins that change the firing rate bump stocks?
2027 2018-03-15 06:07:23 By the way, bump stocks only became an “issue” because of the Las Vegas shooting, which was not school related. Furthermore, you don’t need a “bump stock” to carry out that style of shooting. It can be done without a “bump stock”.
2028 2018-03-15 06:06:44 What happened to all your strong talk about raising the age limit to 21 and how you personally, without the aid of Congress, were going to ban bump stocks? It’s only the NRA, not Putin, so don’t be afraid to do the right thing.  It’s never to late to become a good man.
2029 2018-03-15 06:05:29 And #NRA #realDonaldTrump & #RepublicanPuppets wanna put even more guns in schools. Yeah, that's the solution. And maybe they can give them AR-15s and bump stocks too. #VoteThemOut 2018 & 2020

2031 2018-03-15 06:04:12 The fact that bump stocks are currently legal is simply because it fits in a loop hole.  Learn how they work and WHY people are demanding they be made illegal.

2036 2018-03-15 06:01:38 Lot size has to be reduced first. Make it uniform for all stocks. 10 or 100 - whichever convenient.
2037 2018-03-15 06:01:24 Is your bill specifically about bump stocks, or does it use a more broad term, rate increasing devices, to umbrella ban other perfectly legal and common items you don't like?
2038 2018-03-15 06:01:22 well some stocks put option are dirt cheap right worth taking risk even if zero hardly any loss or 5x-10x returns
2039 2018-03-15 06:00:57 Hey @CalSTRS & @CalPERS: I support @CalTreasurer's initiative to divest from companies that make and sell bump stocks and similar dangerous accessories that can turn a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic one! #DivestForOurLives #DefundGuns #DrainTheNRA

Watch and see! Its not about us, its about him!

2043 2018-03-15 06:00:07 Great , inside news of stock going for crash on 28 March. I will dump all my stock and go in crypto. 2018 is really what they say crashing for stock and bond. That’s bad for stocks investors like us. But there are new space for us. Crypto space.

2046 2018-03-15 05:59:49 No one needs your weapons of war or bump stocks--keep them to yourself. I grew up with a serious hunter & was taught  respect for weapons from birth. Anything other than hunting or protection should be regulated. This is simple except for your greed.
2047 2018-03-15 05:59:00 Sounds like you are effecting a positive change. Keep up the GOOD work.

What kind of teacher discourages motivated students taking affirmative action to achieve their goal? 

#NRA is the Public enemy.
AR-15 style weapons, bump stocks, large capacity magazines must be banned.

2050 2018-03-15 05:56:43 looks like #FANG stocks have run up a bit too much. there is a definite need for correction at these level. Expect #DOW to get below 24k. #my2cents
2051 2018-03-15 05:56:43 I'm with you on bump stocks. Are you lumping the ArmaLite-15 in with "assault rifles", though? Because I can show you a semi-auto "hunting rifle" that uses a wood stock but the same barrel, receiver and bolt as an AR-15, and can accept 30rd magazines. Ban that too?
2052 2018-03-15 05:56:13 It is only illegal if you don't have a class 3 license, which are surprisingly easy to get. With things like bomb stocks, or even a small amount of training, you can still put several hundred rounds per minute down range. That is the whole gimmick around advertising rate of fire.
2053 2018-03-15 05:55:08 aare bhai all old investors are happy with LTCG

2056 2018-03-15 05:54:10 And why do we have 2 stocks? Right. Because people live forever (partially) because they recover for free.
2057 2018-03-15 05:53:59 more power to all calling for more sensible gun control. it's pretty sad how low the bar is though -- calling to ban bump stocks, demanding background checks and raising age limit from 18 to 21? really? is this how bad off we are. shit, that's really bad.
2058 2018-03-15 05:53:37 I won't disagree that bump stocks should be made illegal.
2059 2018-03-15 05:53:18 @RobinhoodApp do you have simple monitoring tools for stock (also EU stocks) with alerts and stuff? I don’t even want to buy, just be aware.

2061 2018-03-15 05:51:46 Keep your pistol, your hunting rifle and your shot gun. No one is committing mass murder with them.

2094 2018-03-15 05:17:37 Semiautomatic weapons, high capacity magazines, bump stocks, and suppressors should all be banned. There’s no reason anyone would need those for hunting, target shooting, or self defense.

2098 2018-03-15 05:15:42 Have you considered that market discounts events ahead of news?

We never knew why stocks dropped by 10% in February. Maybe it was because of the trade war fears?

Just like the way market wasn’t worried about US-NK war, either. I rather trust the market, then follow news. $SPY
2099 2018-03-15 05:15:18 LK congratulations. I have the upmost respect for your knowledge and experience. Instead of lowering the capital gains tax. I would reduce the dividend tax on people 55 and over. Seniors buy and hold dividend stocks. That’s what the middle class own. Thanks

Bump stocks are not allowed in shooting ranges because  the gun cannot be aimed.

It is ONLY useful for two ppl: who don't respect their weapons and think they are toys. And mass killers.

Ban bump stocks.

2139 2018-03-15 04:47:46 First, there are many many countries in the world with the same freedoms as this one (of speech, to protest, etc.) and people don’t need to own any guns to guarantee this. Second, NO ONE has said they want the 2nd amendment repealed, just AR-15s and bump stocks banned. 1/2
2140 2018-03-15 04:47:20 At first it was banning bump stocks, improving backgrounds check and moving age to buy AR from 18 to 21. Now it’s training teachers to shoot & more security? You’re pathetic.
2141 2018-03-15 04:47:08 Bump stock ban, likely. If automatic weapons are going to have strict regulations, bump stocks are a massive loophole, and should be under the same consideration.

Well across the crypto universe, all cryptos from Bitcoin to ICOs had already experienced several SUCCESSIVE falls of 20% since Jan 2018

2147 2018-03-15 04:41:41 Are you asking me personally? I’d ban assault weapons and bump stocks tomorrow if it was up to me. I’m sick of the NRA. And I misspoke above, I thought the bill was by Joseph Kennedy. So I’m going to delete that tweet.
2148 2018-03-15 04:41:07 How about banning the.private ownership of military and military-like hardware, banning bump stocks, mandatory background checks for all, three day waiting period and mental health screening?

2154 2018-03-15 04:37:37 *flattens ears* Well I justvchecked my bank account and found that the stocks I sold a few days ago had finally gone through and I had a little money. So I went and bought a grilled cheese sandwich from Sonic. And a brownie and cookie dough master blast. :3
2155 2018-03-15 04:37:19 Sure but how many local stations do you need in a market?   Local news is bull case for many investors it tv station stocks.   Also a growing number if people prefer weather without the breathless hype of often minor events.
2156 2018-03-15 04:36:55 Got a AMD RX 580 in the new year for $399, and now it looks like 580 worth about $500. so 25% increase in value in 3 month, better investment than most stocks! @AMD

2172 2018-03-15 04:20:39 As for after-market bump stocks, I would never use them, because they make your accuracy shit- its designed to bounce the rifle off your shoulder to cause your finger to depress the trigger more rapidly than your mind can make your finger move. I support banning them, I guess.

2177 2018-03-15 04:15:04 The swing trade recos are good for 2 days - 2 weeks. Look for small % gains. If you are getting 1-2% in 1-2 days, book.

2178 2018-03-15 04:12:03 Tell me what's sensible? 
Like the seatbelt law?  First it wasn't a ticket,  then it wasn't a pull over offense,  now itit's all of those things. 
First it will be bump stocks,  then we will have to register,  then you will take them.

2187 2018-03-15 04:06:12 It may not solve all, but it may make mass murders less effective. Bump stocks enabled the Las Vegas shooter to kill 50 people and injure over 500 in 10 minutes. The AR-15 is the sister of the M-16. It is made to kill humans and the choice of many mass shooters.
2188 2018-03-15 04:05:19 Yeehaw im waiting for the stocks on mini trahearne to have lua and civvea?
2189 2018-03-15 04:05:05 I stand corrected. My challenge is that bump stocks have no practical use other than firing into a crowd. So why after 5 months after the Las Vegas shooting are they still legal?
2190 2018-03-15 04:04:52 Stop flash sale.  If you have sufficient stocks then why not a open sale.
2191 2018-03-15 04:04:52 2nd amendment was written when citizens carried muskets.Forefathers couldn’t imagine them purchasing semi-automatic weapons&bump stocks 4 brutal mass killings.We should interpret historical documents in light of the time they were created & how the world has changed. #GunControl

2199 2018-03-15 04:01:08 Viewing stocks as representing part ownership of a business shifts the focus from their day-to-day price fluctuations to the factors that tend to drive their valuations, which are their long-term fundamentals. - Prof. Ben Branch, University of Massachusetts

2205 2018-03-15 03:56:46 I believe they are called “bump stocks” and most of the gun enthusiasts I know view bump stocks as wildly inaccurate and only useful for spraying inaccurately - Vegas.  NRA didn’t even care about defending them.

2208 2018-03-15 03:53:38 Gold mining stocks have skidded through their 2001 lows for 2 years in a row. The XLV was lower than it was in 1997. The gold price model is flawed. Gold mining is a failed business.
2209 2018-03-15 03:52:47 How about we worry about our children's safety first. Background checks, assault style weapons ban, and a ban on bump stocks would be a good start.
2210 2018-03-15 03:51:29 I don’t support bump stocks I think they are stupid. To be honest even in the Marines using automatic was rarely necessary, usually just a waste unless used for suppression and movement in a firefight.
2211 2018-03-15 03:51:21 #stockinvesting : Q3 results were much better than Q1 & Q2. Now, Q4 will be even better than Q3. This is the time to invest in promising stocks for long term, before Q4 results season starts

2256 2018-03-15 03:24:35 If you watch business news channels on TV during a bullmarket, you will start believing that stocks always go up and never go down.

If you watch the same channels during a bearmarket or a correction, you will soon start believing that the end of the world is near.
2257 2018-03-15 03:23:35 We all know this is token legislation. A fraction of what you should be doing. Ban assault weapons. Ban bump stocks. Raise the age to buy guns to 21. Universal background checks. You were elected to represent your constituents not the NRA. Get it done or GET OUT of government.
2258 2018-03-15 03:22:47 tire shopping by next month i like my stocks unos 33’s or 35’s nomas simple and clean
2259 2018-03-15 03:22:17 I don't really follow those stocks. My answer is, "I don't know."
2260 2018-03-15 03:22:13 It might also have been NCLU that might have pushed for Bump Stocks. Either way Levin talked about it. The sad part is this effects some Vets
2261 2018-03-15 03:21:57 corporate balance sheets to buy back stock to juice EPS s-t and goose stocks so they can cash out option packages? Manias are far bigger and widespread than just a hand full of idiot prop traders.
2262 2018-03-15 03:21:18 It’s a fluff piece. They don’t have the courage to do what’s right. The NRA is driving this discussion for their own benefit. Assault & military weapons need to be banned; bump stocks banned; enhanced background checks and indepth discussions & solutions to identify kids at risk.
2263 2018-03-15 03:21:17 A fraction of what you should be doing. Ban assault weapons. Ban bump stocks. Raise the age to buy guns to 21. Universal background checks. You were elected to represent your constituents not the NRA. Get it done or GET OUT of my government.

2265 2018-03-15 03:20:32 No more committees, debates, or deliberation? You’ve solved mass shootings completely? You haven’t closed the Charleston Loophole that let Dylan Roof get a gun. Why don’t you put forth a plan like Rick Scott? Common sense stuff like no bump stocks, no guns until you’re 21. Geez.
2266 2018-03-15 03:19:58 No no no. Not just cheese. It’s CHEESE CURDS. Anyone who makes it with shredded mozzarella deserves to me put into the stocks.
2267 2018-03-15 03:19:34 Dumb and getting dumber Bill the self funded retired will get a bigger tax paid pension because every $ they do not get from their franking credits they will be eligible for $3 extra in their age  pension, great decision Bill no need to watch the stocks as often.

2271 2018-03-15 03:18:38 Anyone know of a flexible dashboarding UI framework? I kind of want to build a "life dashboard" that includes all the websites I check every day. eg. Stripe income, Google Analytics, Github issues, stocks, Twitter notifications, etc.
2272 2018-03-15 03:18:33 Too bad the best basketball player in the arena tonight is coaching.  ASU could have used Bobby Hurley the player instead of the coach
2273 2018-03-15 03:14:43 So I get the idea that a strong economy (wages, employment, stocks market, etc...) are good for incumbents, but didn’t the Dems have as good an economy and we lost midterms and the last election. Not sure how that matters anymore.
2274 2018-03-15 03:14:31 jan and feb are historical bad months in stocks and crypto.  Would not be buying anything in these months.
2275 2018-03-15 03:14:07 Hey Pete. Why do you like these low float stocks? Asking for a newbie friend I know of.....
2276 2018-03-15 03:13:32 Probably not as kudlow once wanted to go to war so his stocks would go up.
2277 2018-03-15 03:13:27 So the working people dumb enough to vote for you will have their super cut because the trade funds that invest in franked stocks will no longer get franking credits in their pension fund super. Should amount to several thousand $ a year for some body with a $200,000 fund balance
2278 2018-03-15 03:13:15 We are now closing the form for this month. Today is the last day of payment, all item that doesn't meet our deadline will be cancel for pre-order. But dont worry, we have limited stocks in #ConcordiaMNL See you there. ^^
2279 2018-03-15 03:13:03 Stocks close slightly higher, trimming earlier gains
2280 2018-03-15 03:12:32 Why not? We broke parabolic, which traditionally has resulted in an ~80% correction. Large investors don't buy stocks that wipe out that kind of wealth overnight. Average Joe has been burned hard. What does BTC actually have going for it at this point?  The bear market cometh.
2281 2018-03-15 03:12:31 why would any sane American be against background checks or a 18 year old having an assault rifle,0r bump stocks
2282 2018-03-15 03:12:06 Melee and Smash would be better with 3 stocks
2283 2018-03-15 03:11:42 Banning Bump Stocks. They're people out there. Disabled. Who can't shoot a weapon. Because. Gasp. Oh! That's bad. Stupid is. As stupid does. Bump Stocks did you know we're pushed by. Gasp. The NNACP. This device was invented for people who had missing arms. Bet you didn't know
2284 2018-03-15 03:10:59 I think fractions is a big part of what makes crypto accessible to the average person, and fractional stocks could be another game changer for Robinhood
2285 2018-03-15 03:09:59 Is it called Lowe's in Charlotte anymore? Business has stocks to buy back with tax cut winnings
2286 2018-03-15 03:09:06 sorry chum. ubos na stocks namin
2287 2018-03-15 03:08:40 Surely you don't believe bump stocks were the cause for Las Vegas.
A madman with a stock pile of guns that he somehow packed into a hotel unchecked was the only cause #LiberalLunacy
2288 2018-03-15 03:07:06 I think madami pang stocks kasi after namin bumili nagre-restock sila kaagad or something. Good luck!

2291 2018-03-15 03:06:35 No sir, actually i checked each and every stock and found them to be quality stocks..so whats the problem in copying good things from seniors..

2306 2018-03-15 03:02:26 Please outlaw bump stocks, high volume assault rifles and high volume ammunition AND increase background checks and increase all screenings and waiting periods before someone can buy a gun.

2314 2018-03-15 02:59:22 I can not see any logical reason for selling AR-15 assault rifles and bump-stocks to anyone at any age. For home defense I want a handgun or shotgun for short range action. The right to have an AR-15 for target practice is not worth the risk.
2315 2018-03-15 02:58:08 It's great! Corporations are using that money to buy back stocks, laying off people, and going automated to use less people. All the opposite of what you said it would be. Trickle down, bullshit!

2321 2018-03-15 02:55:12 The Oct. 1 Las Vegas shooting.  Everybody focused on 'bump stocks.'  Something must be done about Bump Stocks!  Yet ... Paddock had a room full of guns.  Why did he need so many?  One would do.  Here is what I think happened ... it was a FBI sting to nab Russian mobsters ...
2322 2018-03-15 02:55:00 And they haven't even illegalized bump stocks yet. Because they don't have skin in the game. It's not their kids dying. It's not their loved ones chalk outlines. 

%97 of Americans want background checks. That's not done yet.

#NationalStudentWalkout
2332 2018-03-15 02:48:08 To bump stocks, I think just because it CAN be done with a belt loop doesn’t mean we need to make it easier. Is a belt loop as viable as something manufactured for that exact purpose to shoot up a school? I’m guessing not.  Anything that would be preferential to someone looking
2333 2018-03-15 02:48:08 Yes but it is headache for me. If I run Algo on 200 stocks then I hardly get 1-2 signal in a day and if I select option Liquidity based stocks then will not get even 1 signal in a week.

2339 2018-03-15 02:44:19 The problem with gun control is not the laws but rather the enforcement of the law. Now I don't have a problem with bump stocks that was really stupid and the ATF should have never allowed that.
2340 2018-03-15 02:44:10 Yest late rally in PSU banks stocks is surprising as nothing fundamental has changed 
Some reports suggest that mtm losses will not be booked in q3
But this is all window dressing guys 
The real test is the loan book growth and asset quality stress
2341 2018-03-15 02:44:10 bump stocks were used in one crime... ever. Assault weapon is a made up term that does nothing but regular what a gun LOOKS like. This is why we laugh at the stupidity of "common sense gun laws".

2359 2018-03-15 02:36:40 High capacity clips are hard to obtain already  and POTUS is banning bump stocks something  Obama admin had a chance and failed to do
2360 2018-03-15 02:36:29 strategic. Taller bldgs allowed. Locations moved inside new hubs. Builders across city more or less same groups. Guess Govt has cleared projects + slum and bldg redev, infra being created thru metro. strategy is build when situation allows . Stocks cornered and can be sold later
2361 2018-03-15 02:35:34 West Coast's key position stocks are elite, but their midfield is deep in rebuild mode.
2362 2018-03-15 02:34:43 So there's this guy serving 54 years N San Quentin prison who learned how to read at 22, learned how to trade stocks, & co founded a program that teaches inmates about investing
2363 2018-03-15 02:34:11 All you care about is money and that’s sad. There is no ethical reason to protect the public’s being able to own assault riffles armor piercing rounds or bump stocks. Next you will want grenades and bazookas to be on sale at every store
2364 2018-03-15 02:34:06 Banning bump stocks is a joke. If you actually research bump-firing you would understand what I mean. It’s a feel good action that does nothing. I disagree with raising the gun age because American young adults do not commit most of the mass shootings.
2365 2018-03-15 02:33:03 I understand what you’re saying but crypto will be “tamed” by government and big institutions much like traditional stocks.  This has been foreseen for some time now.  In 2014 the IRS passed the tax rule and ever since then I knew it was only a matter of time 
2366 2018-03-15 02:32:24 Everybody is talking about taxes but I can't wait til I take my stocks out.. Imma be Oprah rich.
2367 2018-03-15 02:31:24 Caca, most of these so called pensioners, probably have too much money to get a pension, and are double dipping with tax refunds.  They most likely would have a house paid for and at least a million in stocks.
2368 2018-03-15 02:28:50 Invest 50% in physical silver, gold, Swiss Francs and Yuan.
These days we cannot risk in just one Fiat currency. Stocks overheated.
2369 2018-03-15 02:28:06 Victim of the index mentality. Just because a stock resides in a low pe index does not make it a value stock. The same is true of a high pe stock in a high pe index.  Financial stocks have always had lower pe's because they grow slower.  Doesn't mean there is value though.
2370 2018-03-15 02:26:47 Limited lang daw yung stocks!!

2372 2018-03-15 02:25:33 Rick Scott pushed a bill foreword five days ago that will raise the minimum age to buying guns to 21, as well as banning bump stocks, creating a 3 day waiting period for buying guns, and gives police more authority to confiscate weapons. Five days ago. Changes are being made
2373 2018-03-15 02:25:12 Bow to ur way of preaching and thanks for caring small investors.. once u said abt sugar stocks but I was over carried n held on..
    I see now what it means wen a worthy man speaks...
2374 2018-03-15 02:25:09 Bump stocks are insanely complicated, because bump firing is a technique, not a device.  You can do it with the belt loop of your pants, so the question becomes "What do we ban?  And how?"  Suppressors (or silencers) are more hearing protrection than anything else, and...
2375 2018-03-15 02:24:43 You are probably referring to bump stocks... Are you aware that can be done without the stock?
2376 2018-03-15 02:24:37 If you truly paid attention, you would return $3.8 million of #NRABloodMoney and work with @SenBennetCO to pass universal background checks and outlaw AR-15s and bump stocks.
2377 2018-03-15 02:22:38 Did you ban military style assault rifles, did you ban bump stocks, did you put the age to purchase at 21, did you insist that stringent background checks for every purchase be implemented, if not you are just full of B S  and do not deserve to be in congress R E S I G N
2378 2018-03-15 02:22:38 How are the banks looking for the next two days? Any body looking at the weekly options in $JPM #weeklyoptions #stocks #jpm
2379 2018-03-15 02:21:08 With the advent of 3D printers I don’t think bump stocks can be truly banned.   Besides, criminals don’t obey laws, new laws just end up adversely impacting law abiding citizens.
2380 2018-03-15 02:20:22 0 stocks, Rock Paper Scissors decides the winner
2381 2018-03-15 02:20:12 The Toy’s R Us closing has made Amazon stocks skyrocket
2382 2018-03-15 02:20:09 @BTS_twt is extending and collaborating a lot with various companies. I feel like they are preparing for going public soon. And I will definitely buy some stocks if possible (well, I meant my dad, since I am still a minor...)
2383 2018-03-15 02:20:06 @IngrahamAngle lets live perfect world for a sec. Congress passed a gun control Bill that raised age to 21,banned bump stocks made ar15 illegal and passed tougher bkgnd, protection to schools. Now do you think kids would have protest? No they would have honored the dead.
2384 2018-03-15 02:18:19 tired of the cold weather
2385 2018-03-15 02:18:18 Just hating stupid gun laws regarding assault weapons, dangerous modifiers/ bump stocks/high capacity magazines, background checks, etc. Let's try that and see if things don't improve, rather than saying "no" right off.
2386 2018-03-15 02:17:50 Damn lost to Dabuz and Raptor. Took stocks off Dabuz again and almost won game 2. Replay of the last time we played.

Raptor legit bodied me. I have no idea how to fight Yoshi. I sometimes even have trouble with bad Yoshi...so against raptor it was bad.

2390 2018-03-15 02:16:31 Goes for most of the crypto/blockchain tied stocks. Chart looking all similar. Oh how things change so quickly.
2391 2018-03-15 02:16:28 And, when I noted that the bill had virtually no gun legislation, I never proposed banning guns, or removing guns. The low hanging fruit with overwhelming support nationally is for universal background checks, ban bump stocks, giving teeth to what authorities can do with warmings
2392 2018-03-15 02:16:20 I’m not seeing any rational behind high capacity mags or bump stocks
2393 2018-03-15 02:15:49 Yung mga laughing stocks and jokes when I was in Elementary are now memes in Facebook. Hahahaha
2394 2018-03-15 02:14:25 Raise the age limit. Comprehensive background checks. No bump stocks. Ban assault weapons. 

DO SOMETHING! #NationalStudentWalkout
2395 2018-03-15 02:13:53 Republicans don't want to get bump stocks off our streets. They want to get more cash in their bank accounts. We'll take care of them at the polls.
2396 2018-03-15 02:12:42 Thank you for your continued efforts to ban bump stocks.  You have been a strong voice against them.  There is no reason to have these weapons of war on the streets. #BanAssaultWeapons
2397 2018-03-15 02:12:38 I would have some too I’m quite sure if I got into stocks! No shame brother
2398 2018-03-15 02:11:50 What about bump stocks? High capacity magazines? and universal background checks? 

 AME!!!
2399 2018-03-15 02:11:42 Who in Vermont hunts with AR-15s and bump stocks? He was old enough to know better, but sided with the NRA every time and children died. There is no excuse for that.

2401 2018-03-15 02:11:03 So you want to ban armor lite rifles?  Any particular caliber? .22, .223, .308? What if they do not have tacticle stocks?  Do we leave the Benelli M4 cerakote alone?  I'm thinking if the LEO's had been allowed to enter the school they would have had an advantage with the M4.

2407 2018-03-15 02:05:49 hi! unfortunately we acquired these on a pre-order basis so we only have the exact number of stocks for our buyers :(
2408 2018-03-15 02:05:32 The next shooter most likely has a gun and their only answer is attack law abiding citizens. I am for getting rid of bump stocks even though it will probably mean nothing.
2409 2018-03-15 02:05:22 I majorly doubt that they had assault weapons as dangerous as the AR-15 and bump stocks all the way back in 1787. But please, enlighten me.
2410 2018-03-15 02:05:07 That probably depends on what other crap you’ve hidden in the bill. How about a 1-Page bill that only bans bump stocks?

2412 2018-03-15 02:04:31 Since U know so much, U have no clue that there was NO limit to the # of AR's or AK's Americans could purchase during the AWB. I know. I bought 1. The ban was no mags more 10 rnds. no collapsible stocks, no muzzle breaks, no lugs for a bayonet, and they must have a Heavy Barrell
2413 2018-03-15 02:04:16 As of 10:00 a.m., PSEi 8,304.25 down 44.49 points or 0.53 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2414 2018-03-15 02:03:41 Decisive break below 24,650 would blow up a sideways pattern, & would mean stocks very likely r headed sharply lower, possibly an imminent crash scenario.  Point is, stocks r about to start a very powerful move, & the direction will soon be revealed by the stock market itself.
2415 2018-03-15 02:03:27 You’re wicked good at doin stocks. U like when emilio changed your socks. 

We never hung out & it makes me sad. All the good times we coulda had.

2416 2018-03-15 02:03:01 But did you vote to ban semiotic machine guns did you vote to ban bump stocks? NO,  so you're not doing anything
2417 2018-03-15 02:02:18 If you always wanted to buy stocks like most have including myself, buy Crypto instead! It’s the future!
2418 2018-03-15 02:01:46 I see their stocks dropped,  about the same time tRump was there too, I believe
2419 2018-03-15 02:01:09 Looks like I'll invest in a few more bump stocks just to spite you

    In ban: Andhra Bank, Balrampur Chini, Bank of India, BEML, Dewan Housing, IDBI, JP Associates, TV18 Broadcast.

    New in ban: Bank of India, TV18 Broadcast.
2422 2018-03-15 02:00:49 You did nothing. You are a fraud donald. You stripped away your promise to raise the age limit on gun purchases, to outlaw bump stocks and ban assault rifles. The NRA owns you.
2423 2018-03-15 01:59:56 oh wow I remember she was so nasty...so glad her and that failing time in wwe history is over. Our stocks where rock bottom, thanks to that crapy time. Everybody was watching WCW they were so much better than what can we say.

    U.S. stocks fell for the third straight day after lackluster retail sales figures fanned concern that consumer spending is cooling, while traders awaited next week’s rate decision by the Federal Reserve.

    Ten-year Treasury yields tightened.

2431 2018-03-15 01:55:06 $MDXG I thought insider trading rules apply to ex-employees and contractors that disseminate non public information to family members or short sellers who trade for or against the stocks in question. Las Vegas and Canada can be great places to pass on non public information.
2432 2018-03-15 01:54:38 My stocks looking crazy today!.
2433 2018-03-15 01:54:25 I hope that it was on a responsible blend of stocks, bonds, and real estate.
2434 2018-03-15 01:54:05 Because we as a society recognize that the danger of having those weapons outweighs the potential benefits. The same logic applies to AR-15s, since it’s too easy to acquire technology (such as bump stocks) that can make those weapons fully automatic. (part 2)

2440 2018-03-15 01:50:29 A good move would be to read up on the difference btwn auto and semi-auto. Big difference. Hunters and trap shooters have no use for bump stocks, and support their ban. Be open to all views; you may find that politics are the sinister player. Shooting is an Olympic competition.
2441 2018-03-15 01:50:14 Be careful on those stocks my man, they can turn against you just as fast

2450 2018-03-15 01:46:08 Bump stocks were used on the weapons that injured like 500 people in Las Vegas. Not nearly as many people would have been hurt if he couldn't fire as quickly.
2451 2018-03-15 01:46:00 I think most people get trapped in stocks after listening to the brokerage calls. Do you own research and if the story is strong enough to convince you, then enter. Mistakes will happen. Learn from it. Thanks a lot Pankaj Sir for this valuable insight.
2452 2018-03-15 01:45:21 Today felt like a stock pickers market with several leading names continuing to make new highs. In this environment it is more important to focus on individual setups than on what the index is doing.  The behavior of leading stocks will let you know when you should get defensive

2456 2018-03-15 01:43:07 Never buy a stock after such a big move. With an overbought sector. For short term traders, the time to buy is at the beginning/middle of the move. Yes, certain stocks can seem to run forever, NVDA etc, but it breaks the 80/20 rule. Move to the next stock & forget this one.
2457 2018-03-15 01:43:01 And where is that Executive Order banning bump stocks or are you afraid of the NRA as you accused others.
2458 2018-03-15 01:42:56 @maddow Use your soap box to make theirs louder!  Ban assault weapons, ban high capacity clips, ban bump stocks, require background checks, close down gun show, raise the age to buy a gun. #NeverAgain
2459 2018-03-15 01:42:35 And I'm not just talking about some bans on stocks or certain types of guns that look scary. But during all this the real problem shouldn't be lost out of focus, otherwise the next time the headline will just read knife, axe or chainsaw instead of gun.
2460 2018-03-15 01:42:23 History might repeats itself but will be in a much faster pace, too much has changed, ppl are way too connected. Trading stocks in the 70s is a different game with trading stocks today, same applies to $BTC.
2461 2018-03-15 01:42:13 Universal background checks, banning bump stocks, raising the age to 21 to own a gun. Most peole also find it bizarre that weaoons used in the military can be legally purchased by civilians. Not exactly threatening anyones freedom.
2462 2018-03-15 01:38:27 And yet no ban on assault weapons or bumper stocks. How is this good?!
2463 2018-03-15 01:36:34 Darn it, Obama said THIS Trump ECONOMY/JOBS was IMPOSSIBLE stumping4 HRC. He said how's Trump going2 get consistent 3% GDP? It CAN'T B done. O didn't know how. Trump has gotten consistent 3%GDP after his 1st qtr. & stocks have set multiple records..not just 1 record..multiple Xs!
2464 2018-03-15 01:36:02 Little did he know, as a result of this moment, Julian Zhu would be responsible for tens of thousands of Falco stocks falling swiftly to Sheik and Marth DJ fairs for years to come.
2465 2018-03-15 01:35:41 Since when did prayer stop a bullet?  Time to ban those assault type guns, bump stocks, large capacity magazines, time to stop letting guns and bad people with guns kill so many people.
2466 2018-03-15 01:34:55 He just stays in florida while the stocks drop daily
2467 2018-03-15 01:34:54 Maybe keep flooding it to keep price down till the ticker change and buy back. It goes up cost them that much more to get rid of a shit ton of stocks is my guess. I don’t know how to look at numbers to see if that’s happening but something is keeping it down
2468 2018-03-15 01:34:44 They "FAANG" type stocks are heavily weighted in the indexes is my point.  Defense is the name of the game!  Paul Tudor Jones:  paraphrasing  "always be protecting your butt"!   :)
2469 2018-03-15 01:34:27 Not enough! Quit taking blood money from the NRA you Asshole. Do the right thing. Tougher gun laws and ban assault rifles and bump stocks. These kids will be voting in the next election and will vote all of you IDIOTS out of office! I  will thank the Lord when that day comes
2470 2018-03-15 01:34:19 I trust the #SEC is checking the @NYSE to determine whether ppl are making $ after short-selling stocks based on #InsiderTrading info received from @WhiteHouse @USTreasury
2471 2018-03-15 01:34:06 I read your bill. If it cleanly banned bump stocks you might get traction but you chose to ban all semi-automatic weapons- nearly all of them. If you already have one you are fine but new purchases, forget it.
2472 2018-03-15 01:34:01 MBTC stocks rights offer priced at Php75/share
2473 2018-03-15 01:32:43 $AMZN, $AAPL:  be very careful if these two heavily weighted stocks start rolling over! FAANG stocks showing a little bit of cracking, if they break, honor your stops! IMHO, not that much holding up the market. $TWTR, $PYPL have super charts, but FAANG stocks are heavy weights!
2474 2018-03-15 01:32:32 Short both stocks then
2475 2018-03-15 01:31:51 You really don’t pay attention do you? Maybe u should consider that 85% of citizens, many who are Republican & conservative want better gun regulations, restrictions on certain guns, to ban things like bump stocks and a host of other things. Don’t assume this is a liberal issue.
2476 2018-03-15 01:30:28 So he lies and says "We would not have experienced what we experienced in Las Vegas, if the sale of bump stocks were banned." The only thing a bumpstock is good for is to keep you from aiming. W.E.: do some research then do some REAL reporting.
2477 2018-03-15 01:30:22 How do you scan stocks like this?
2478 2018-03-15 01:30:04 Bond King Jeffrey Gundlach says the yield on the 10-yr Note will likely move higher and push Stocks down.

2509 2018-03-15 01:11:48 US stocks declined on Wednesday, with major indices coming off early gains as fears of a potential trade war resurfaced after president Donald Trump announced his administration would seek to trim the US trade deficit with China by $100 billion via tariffs.
2510 2018-03-15 01:11:14 Every single change.  Universal back ground checks, ban on bump stocks, age limit increase.... I would even turn the question back around and ask what gun regulation they have ever been ok with?
2511 2018-03-15 01:10:46 Thanks for the coverage. One correction: I counted 12 Delawareans who gave testimony in support of banning bump stocks.
2512 2018-03-15 01:10:21 @Filapek hi Rudi what stocks of yours are up today ?

2515 2018-03-15 01:09:13 No one is a “good, honest” person who wants to keep assault rifles, bump stocks, silencers, extended magazines- and all the other trappings of a gun obsession-legal and available to “good people” having a bad day. #NRAKillsKids
2516 2018-03-15 01:08:58 Make it 21 to buy a weapon, ban bump stocks, and outlaw assault weapons

2518 2018-03-15 01:04:52 Hey @CalSTRS & @CalPERS! I support @CalTreasurer's initiative to divest from companies that make & sell bump stocks and similar accessories that can turn a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic!  I put into both STRS & PERS #DivestForOurLives #DefundGuns #DrainTheNRA

2521 2018-03-15 01:03:28 Když se dívám na své poznámky, tak na letošní konferenci zaznělo hodně nových zajímavých informací. Celkem jsem absolvoval 11 panelů, 3 analytické snídaně a viděl 23 společností. Ještě zítra navštívit 5 dalších společností v Cambridgi a vracím se domů.
2522 2018-03-15 01:03:08 All these penny stocks are scams. Every fucking one of them
2523 2018-03-15 01:03:05 The problem with you is you can't just stop at banning bump stocks. You have to add in verbiage about banning any modifications to guns that improve there performance. Many manufacturers make enhancements to triggers groups and bolts you would ban them too.
2524 2018-03-15 01:02:40 You’re bill doesn’t just address bump stocks.
2525 2018-03-15 01:02:19 I hope it's 3 but only if camping isn't so prevalent. I don't wanna deal with sonic or bayo in a situation where i'm 2 stocks behind. fuck that
2526 2018-03-15 01:00:21 I don’t have a fairytale relationship! It’s a REAL LIFE relationship! We building together bruh so we can retire early! Ya’ll keep the matchin’ J’s! Cause we trying to match checking accounts, saving accounts, stocks, and bonds!
2527 2018-03-15 01:00:09 I have held guns and I can comment.

Ban the AR15. Ban bump stocks. Raise legal purchase age on all guns to 21. Require testing of knowledge and ability before licensing. Owners mustt insure each individual firearm against theft and liability.
2528 2018-03-15 00:59:37 @WarrenBuffett doesn’t invest in cryptocurrency.. Said it’ll end badly  and as I look over most of them their stocks are down
2529 2018-03-15 00:59:25 One thing im really curious about is if Smash 5 will be 2 stocks or 3 stocks...
2530 2018-03-15 00:58:30 Sen Warrens stock portfolio is full of bank stocks. Before you believe every word out of her mouth look up her financial records.  So she invests in them but is against them. She stands for nothing except lining her pockets
2531 2018-03-15 00:58:08 Did the ATF director acknowledge that bump stocks and "assault rifles" are not the problem? Did he acknowledge that handguns are responsible for a majority of the homicides? Crap.... I just let the cat out of the bag. Now you will be after our handguns
2532 2018-03-15 00:58:02 3/3 I recommend a gun buyback program for AR15’s & bump stocks.   Thank you
2533 2018-03-15 00:57:47 No bump stocks.  No high capacity magazines.  Semi automatic rifles for military and for rental at shooting ranges only.  Background checks and a three day waiting period for all gun purchases.
2534 2018-03-15 00:55:29 wanna learn stocks .
2535 2018-03-15 00:54:46 Bump stocks are BS, if you want to ban em, fine. That is like taking cigarette lighters out of cars. 2nd amendment says we keep our guns. You need to retire, your brain is becoming jello.
2536 2018-03-15 00:54:37 1.) The walkout solves absolutely everything? When in the past 20 years have we seen any president move to ban bump stocks as well as move the purchase age up to 21?  NEVER. You can say that talking to people with seemingly no friends helps, but I beg to differ. Anyone could have

2539 2018-03-15 00:54:18 Every single student hates gun deaths. Every single student is frustrated by inaction. Since Columbine our laws have become more lax, not more restrictive. We can't even ban bump stocks which seems pretty simple.  Inaction is what's forced them into the streets.
2540 2018-03-15 00:53:53 Where do you folks come from??? This has R/S stampedall over it. Let’s talk successful stocks with billions in the O/S. Stocks like SIRI. That merger went from .07 to where it’s at now. Why???? Revenues & a recurring rev based business model. They’re actually executing though!!
2541 2018-03-15 00:53:47 think of it as penny stocks. Most are scams but some are legit. Just chose wisely.
2542 2018-03-15 00:53:37 I want a ban on all assault weapons, automatic rifles, bump stocks, & high capacity magazines.  Weapons of war do not belong on our streets! Also please ban ammunition sales on the internet and limit ammo bought by one person. 1/2
2543 2018-03-15 00:53:06 My top stocks,  APTO, BLPH, AUPH, CBAY, SENS, TGTX, SRRA, PTI SRNE, CWBR, PIRS,
2544 2018-03-15 00:52:18 Fair enough, but you still haven't said why we can't both assist students who are at risk of becoming shooters, and put legislation that would prevent another shooting like this from happening (outlawing bump stocks, raising ownership age of rifles to 21, etc.)
2545 2018-03-15 00:52:09 Deregulation will help stock companies get loans to pull up stakes leaving only the poor penny stocks to implode the market. No money will go to employment or foreign exchange recovery.
2546 2018-03-15 00:50:21 History shows that if government agencies did their jobs, countless more lives would be saved than by banning bump stocks. With one exception, bump stocks have never been used in a mass shooting, and even that is debatable since all the official records are closed.
2547 2018-03-15 00:49:52 @JohnCornyn  u said you would ban bump stocks. Will u support this bill?
2548 2018-03-15 00:48:24 man you got me. how're your stocks going?  seems to not be going well:(

2556 2018-03-15 00:45:57 Congratulations
2557 2018-03-15 00:45:00 The ATF director acknowledged in our hearing that banning bump stocks through regulation is likely to be challenged in court, and that the best way to achieve a ban on bump stocks is passing a law. If Republicans want to get bump stocks off our streets, they will support my bill!
2558 2018-03-15 00:44:49 Your right there are smart solutions, Licensing, Reasonable Restrictions (No High Capacity Mags, High Rate of Fire, Suppressors, Bump Stocks, etc..), Background checks on the individual and those in the house hold FOR ALL GUN PURCHASES.
2559 2018-03-15 00:44:26 It's not going to happen overnight, but it could happen. I've had similar thoughts. The problem with stocks is that they're related to earnings. Companies have to actually produce to make profits. All BTC has to do to yield returns is survive and see adoption increases. Returns
2560 2018-03-15 00:44:15 Bump stocks are stupid. Sorry not sorry

That being said.

Universal background checks. Red flag restraints. Expand those ineligible to own guns to cover all domestic violence
2569 2018-03-15 00:37:51 WOW! Completely nailed it, good job man! Do you use hot keys with these types of stocks or all manual, they're just too fast and hotkeys might get you a really bad entry

2579 2018-03-15 00:33:31 DJIA 30 is an index for describing equity prices. DJIA falls short as an indicator of economic health. You cannot evaluate presidents using the DJIA, particularly with interest rates held unusually low over the span of the chart, causing over investment in stocks. Try again.

2581 2018-03-15 00:32:29 So how about we raise all ages to 21? No fighting in a war, no smoking, no drinking, no driving a car, no buying guns and, at the same time outlaw bump stocks, weapons made to kill as many people as possible, large quantity magazines? Solves everyone’s issues.
2582 2018-03-15 00:31:27 Congressional Republicans passed some window dressing to appease the students who want actual gun control. Ban bump stocks and AR's.
2583 2018-03-15 00:31:24 Make it 21 to buy a weapon  , ban bump stocks, ban assault weapons
2584 2018-03-15 00:29:44 What happened to the bump stocks you promised to ban? That ban is not in this bill. Are you just going to do it yourself like you said?

2589 2018-03-15 00:28:14 Hes definitely right... He bragged about his stocks going up "40%"  becuase of his "policies".. NO becuase he manipulated the stocks. Never believe a sales guy!!
2590 2018-03-15 00:26:50 I think it's correlated with all the downward movement on stocks and FX.  I'm heavily short on a lot of stuff to make money on the down trends and then buy on the quick dips.

2592 2018-03-15 00:25:12 As for “fighting gun control”, that is vague.  But I do not agree with every proposed change.  Your tweet suggests you probably want to ban some firearms, perhaps all.  I could go for increasing the age requirements and getting rid of bump stocks.  Maybe more.
2593 2018-03-15 00:25:09 I'm for banning bump stocks and assault weapons, but ur not taking our guns away, think about security for the schools and blame police
2594 2018-03-15 00:25:03 @StockRocket1 you need to stop picking stocks !!!
2595 2018-03-15 00:24:32 We're still waiting for you to pass gun control measures you promised the students, ban bump stocks, fix the NICS system& background checks.
2596 2018-03-15 00:23:51 Would be great to see Apple integrate Robinhood trading functionality with the Stocks app. Every iPhone user gets shown AAPL in app by default and then able to easily buy stock.
2597 2018-03-15 00:23:30 IE not selling semi/fully automatic weapons, high velocity delivery,  customized bullets, high capacity magazines, or bump stocks.   What about that is against democracy?  You'd be more persuasive if you were better informed.

2600 2018-03-15 00:21:12 funny, I did/said that with Stocks, and put ALL my money into Crypto..for each their own.
2601 2018-03-15 00:21:02 Did it include:
Banning assault type rifles, high capacity magazines, and bump stocks?
Increase the gun purchase minimum age to 21? Mandatory background checks, training? Firearm ownership registration? If not, your work is not good enough. Stop taking orders from the @NRA
2602 2018-03-15 00:20:22 Charles, first thank you for now switching to a friendly and positive dialect between us. Much appreciated. As a gun owner, I can tell you that any gun is dangerous if in the wrong hands. POTUS banning AR-15s or bump stocks really does nothing and is simply giving appeasement
2603 2018-03-15 00:20:03 the equilibrium will reach when $fcc price *1.5 =  $USCO price. Gonna be fun jumping between these 2 stocks.

2619 2018-03-15 00:12:07 Did you tell him that Texas gets more @NRA blood money than any other state? And that any felon can buy an AR-15 undetected at aTexas gun show, or that bump stocks are legal and buying an assault rifle is no more complicated than buying a Slurpee?
2620 2018-03-15 00:12:04 Then ban assault rifles, bump stocks, and other semiautomatic long guns

2625 2018-03-15 00:11:09 U r correct 2 stocks have held up the avgs
2626 2018-03-15 00:10:53 All stocks rally on their way to zero
2627 2018-03-15 00:10:43 Let’s just ban the assault weapons and bump stocks rather then raising the age to buy them.
2628 2018-03-15 00:10:14 @TuckerCarlson Don’t ban guns. Ban high velocity cartridges. Ban bump stocks. Ban high capacity magazines. ... Anything that turns a hunting weapon into an assault weapon.
2629 2018-03-15 00:10:12 I thought you were already a part of the discord group?
2630 2018-03-15 00:08:59 Los stocks de cannabis aún no son lo suficientemente fuertes para realizar transacciones con ETFs. Aún estamos en pininos como los stocks de tecnología en los 90s. Es mejor enfocarse en compañías q están haciendo “mergers” y comprar stocks individualmente.
2631 2018-03-15 00:08:33 I thought Trump was the one who supportes raising the gun purchase age, banning stocks, supports other restrictions... 

These poor kids are just SO MISINFORMED :(
2632 2018-03-15 00:08:22 Any luck?
2633 2018-03-15 00:08:02 Pi-Keys to the jail cell stocks divident chart addition
2634 2018-03-15 00:07:44 I just see a jail-cell with stocks adding Dividends to the chart
2635 2018-03-15 00:07:29 If you're jealous then stop being a victim and go buy some stocks.  Not my fault you were too dumb to invest your money properly.
2636 2018-03-15 00:07:07 I can't imagine how peaceful it must be to switch from crypto to stocks... like low volatility and when you go to bed the market literally went to bed too. Wow
2637 2018-03-15 00:06:37 Asia stocks begin lacklustre after a similar subdued tone in US where S&P 500 and DJIA posted a 3rd consecutive loss amid US-China trade tensions and poor US Retail Sales; ASX 200 (-0.2%), Nikkei 225 (-0.2%), KOSPI (-0.1%)
2638 2018-03-15 00:06:02 I can see the bank stocks going up tax reform Phase 2 from president Trump.....

And financial crisis 2.0 coming in soon
2639 2018-03-15 00:04:28 I knew it was going to be a crazy day...one of my stocks took a major dive. 
2640 2018-03-15 00:03:33 You are making far too many assumptions in your attempt at analysing something that should be terribly easy to understand. a) You don't need a literal supply of a chemical to know how it is made and b) the US destroyed the stocks in Nukus. Ergo sum In both cases they had access.
2641 2018-03-15 00:03:33 It is very inspiring. I think we can afford to be
multiracial in this, though we don't use bump stocks
on each other in Detroit (etc.) schools.
2642 2018-03-15 00:03:18 That seems like a stretch...a nightmare to litigate.

I think it'd just be simpler to outlaw things like conversion kits, bump stocks, high capacity mags, etc at the legislative level.
2643 2018-03-15 00:02:44 Well, banning assault weapons and bump stocks  would go a tremendous way of doing that. Very biggily.
2644 2018-03-15 00:02:37 Liberals want all the guns, like Australia.  You think this stops with banning bump stocks?  Nope.  It opened the door.  It’s only the beginning. “ To conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens” — Adolph Hitler (Angela Merkel’s biological father).
2645 2018-03-15 00:02:34 but i'm sure in 5 or 10 years time people will think bump stocks are impossible to build designs for average person too considering our education system
2646 2018-03-15 00:02:31 When are you going to ban bump stocks Cadet Bonespurs
2647 2018-03-15 00:02:16 DON'T ban bump stocks. Ban anything that will turn a semi-automatic weapon into an automatic.
If not a workaround will be developed. 
The gun industry spends millions cheating the intent of the existing laws.
2648 2018-03-15 00:02:03 Is this because the above ground stocks are so low that actual use of silver compared to how much was mined is that high?
2649 2018-03-15 00:00:56 The tobacco stocks are #counted
2650 2018-03-15 00:00:30 “How can he run two companies?!”  

Kidding aside, I got out of Twitter stocks in the low $20’s. Sigh.
2651 2018-03-15 00:00:21 Trading stocks can be done until tomorrow battery life is nothing stressful i spent 2 hours of reading an annuity prospectus.
2652 2018-03-15 00:00:20 Does it include stronger background checks for gun purchases and ban bump stocks?
2653 2018-03-15 00:00:16 Too early stage, no resource, still needs to do ground works to get to drilling. And probably not in one of the hot sectors as punters might have hoped for. I’m holding all my placement stocks, the option terms are jack all, I think/hope there s more
2654 2018-03-15 00:00:09 Gun reform. Bans on altering ANY gun (bump stocks etc); limit how many a person can own; bkgrd ck’d should be a mandatory 90 days.
