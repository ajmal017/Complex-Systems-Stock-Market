41 2019-03-10 23:33:04 That's an idiotic suggestion. Innovative ideas that succeed aren't policy failures. People generate billions in net worth by having ownership (and thus stocks aka equity) in companies that generate high cashflows. To claim that they are is far from reality.

53 2019-03-10 23:21:54 Stocks and bonds are not representative of world GDP by any means, so I'm very confused. These are mutual fund holdings and do not appear to be related to world GDP (much of which is not represented on the stock/bond markets).
54 2019-03-10 23:21:40 Outdated textbooks and no life experience... they took out home ec... which that’s where I learned to sew and cook... school should bring that back as well as add in budgeting your finances and learning how to trade stocks... imo

68 2019-03-10 23:14:28 Those are very straightforward. Trump gave businesses a huge tax break and their stocks soared. Trump imposed tariffs on other countries, so companies said they would bring jobs back to the U.S. but we were already at full employment.
69 2019-03-10 23:14:25 Exactly print more money out of thin air, buy stocks and short volatility. Micromanage that stock market
70 2019-03-10 23:12:59 You'd have to back a good few years to a time when we executed civilians for political espionage in peacetime. In which case, such a wretch would certainly meet a far more grisly end than a mere hanging.

77 2019-03-10 23:07:18 What about what the business needs from them?? This is a 50/50 relationship and all I hear from you is WIFM. Money, benefits, maybe stocks, maybe profit sharing.  What they plan to accomplish has to be aligned with business goals, not pick whatever.
78 2019-03-10 23:06:38 Unless stocks go down, then must cut immediately
79 2019-03-10 23:06:26 I think it's more than that

84 2019-03-10 23:03:53 Pls just dont accept the data for what it shoes. Understand what it means. Home prices for eg are a simple demand & suplly metric. Stocks, likewise. Its a “lag” data. What it could mean that americans are less liquid and their lending ability is lessened.
85 2019-03-10 23:03:53 The more things change the more they stay the same. The reason hemp was made illegal was because of a corrupt politicians and their connections to the DuPont company as hemp was a competitor and by making it illegal their stocks shot up.

87 2019-03-10 23:02:51 No but trading crypto comes at a risk, there's a high number of projects that are just clones of another or absolutely useless, same with a bunch of low cap stocks.

You take the risk, manage the risk, earn or lose money, exit the trade, move on.
88 2019-03-10 23:01:59 The saying “follow the money” seems to be true.  Tax avoidance, stocks and shares and some rich people who want more of what they’ve already got.

98 2019-03-10 22:49:50 So if TurboTax didn't limit you to 500 trades I'd be thinking it was you that's moving these stocks at $900M / 500 = $1.8M/trade. 
99 2019-03-10 22:49:33 It’s a deposit in a really big international mutual fund, that buys both stocks and bonds. You get a very thin slice of future world output. I think the Swiss central bank has approximated that by buying diverse international assets. Likewise, Norwegian sovereign wealth fund.
100 2019-03-10 22:48:06 In contrast stocks, crude oil and industrial metals fell. Futures are painting a mixed picture for Asia Pacific share trading, with Hong Kong and Sydney looking at opening falls but Tokyo tipped to open higher. @MicMcCarthy_CMC

4. Cheap is relative.

129 2019-03-10 22:19:17 I agree that stocks aren't gold. But if stocks have some fundamental value, then estimating returns isn't purely speculative? It's never easy, but it's not like estimating gold's future returns either. And an estimate , however, imprecise, is required for financial planning.

137 2019-03-10 22:14:27 How is this a big deal?  Any how does it relate to you?  America is growing, more adults are competing school and entering the Job Market. It is not because of your policies, or tax cuts that corps are using to buy back stocks.

149 2019-03-10 21:56:52 Dont forget those people that are currently looking for stable stocks as they want to receive dividends and have minimal risk in the upcoming financial market. My choice remains with $KO but I am looking for other ones. People will follow my train of thought.

153 2019-03-10 21:52:06 Decline of edge in public stocks. And chasing edge elsewhere, like VC.
154 2019-03-10 21:52:04 That’s not a correct number. The keener review last year stocks out to me as a poor risk:reward brick toss.
155 2019-03-10 21:51:45 How much did Murdoch pay you to spout that bollox? A failed politician reduced to this. No one is vaguely interested in you any longer you have become one of Britain's biggest laughing stocks. Sad sad little man.
156 2019-03-10 21:49:07 Survive out of stocks, so long as fear exist and that a kingdom falls, a Grimm will exist. Plus dreams were seperate from nightmares as stated by Seer, so it is plausible that when Radiance dies, since she is but the dreams alone, the nightmares remain.

159 2019-03-10 21:47:46 This is one reasons builders stocks fell 27%-38% from recent peaks, the were clearly over bought in 2017 with the thought that sales could blow through 700K and starts would head easily toward 1,500,000 which I never once could be the case in this decade
160 2019-03-10 21:44:12 Ce comportement, c'est du pain béni pour tous les racistes. La gauche est en train de renouveler leurs stocks d'arguments contre l'accueil : en filigrane, on lit que la présence de l'islam en France nécessite d'accepter la régression en matière de liberté de penser ou de dire.

172 2019-03-10 21:25:13 I know. But people think, that if they buy a coin and the project goes well, the coin will go in big green horny candle stick.

But price of coin and project are to different things. They are not stocks. 

Im not negative. But this maket is 1 circus with too much clowns

176 2019-03-10 21:16:00 thanks a lot Daniel..thanks for explaining..so it means these stocks could get a pump at some point to exercise their options, right?
177 2019-03-10 21:15:25 Now that there are listed stocks, the system moves to promote the market
178 2019-03-10 21:14:56 If any Democratic president had ever behaved in the manner of Trump, I've little doubt he'd have been dragged from the WH, tarred & feathered and displayed in stocks on the Capitol Mall.
179 2019-03-10 21:12:10 Help me please: high debt, poor demographics allow deflation to be present. That keeps growth slow and rates low. Bonds earn nada so stocks, particularly those WITH GROWTH are beneficiary of massive liquidity chasing small basket of names??
180 2019-03-10 21:11:47 HOLY MOLY YOURE A CASUAL. You’re talking about the same series where Westbrook’s usage was out of the building and shot a 40% clip from the field? Pg “didn’t show up” but still averaged 25-6 with 2 stocks a game?

182 2019-03-10 21:10:03 But the more I think about how the meta is shifting towards floaty camping/boring your opponent, this may be a necessary change

183 2019-03-10 21:07:42 @MikeBellafiore Hello, Mike. I've developed a very promising and exciting trend continuation system for myself within stocks but I've noticed that when reviewing potential plays, I frequently find myself overwhelmed with what ends up on my watchlist. Too many I guess. Any advice?
184 2019-03-10 21:06:34 Win May canola up A$0.91/t & EU rape up A$1.56. China lifting soybn imports to cover less canola after banning imports from Canada. USDA report reduced Brazil’s crop but by less than expected. Global soybn ending stocks lifted but within expectations.

188 2019-03-10 21:03:12 Odd question but how much of your mind was focused on how Charizard sucks after having the bad stocks game 2? You seemed to play different after trying to get those +100% stocks off pichu
189 2019-03-10 21:02:14 @trevmuchedzi always speaking about offshore investing...

Think he does own some stocks in those companies!
190 2019-03-10 21:02:06 This is something I was working on in the weekend, my own little custom Lithium "indices", which through a little math are weighted by MC. Maybe interesting if you have and interest in Lithium stocks. No advice just as is, make your own judgements what it means, if anything.
191 2019-03-10 21:01:49 Timeouts are hype ngl, and reduced timer would definitely help for length in tournaments, as well for b05 
I really don't know about 3 stocks though. That's a way bigger change than timer or bo5
192 2019-03-10 20:58:28 Woodford been such a shit show for a while. 

Claims he’s value but invests in a range of biotechs, claims to be bullish on U.K., but barely has any U.K. sensitive stocks lol

198 2019-03-10 20:49:29 Production of industrial cannabis is going to happen in 1-2 years. So buy your stocks that are pursuing that rn and you’ll be making easy double digit returns in the year. 

Put your money ahead of legalization.
199 2019-03-10 20:48:31 Have you (or how do you) adjusted your trail stops in the chop environment, I have found using even 2x atr trail stops on high beta stocks tend to stop me out for a loss, only to have the stock return to the older price.

204 2019-03-10 20:39:48 Well most people yes. 

But not CEOs and members of company boards. Or folks with money stashed in tax havens. Or folks generating income from assets (stocks, bonds, property etc...) equal to median income or more.

Thanks
207 2019-03-10 20:37:34 Where can I find this proof that people of different races are not biologically different, but instead all the apparent differences (skin colour let’s say) are socially constructed?
208 2019-03-10 20:37:15 With many stocks being down or stagnant this past week, keep an eye on stronger companies. After investors take profits or pull out of companies while the market condenses, stronger stocks tend to be the ones with the price increase when the market returns. #SundayThoughts

214 2019-03-10 20:32:43 Another amazing thing, if you don't have a subscription to stocks to trade please get it. Oracle is so awesome she will actually make buy and sell suggestions based on mathematical and performance analysis. Great for newer traders, and even seasoned traders.
215 2019-03-10 20:31:59 Lol as if it would hurt anyhow when the majority of the country dislikes the President.

216 2019-03-10 20:31:43 @realDonaldTrump Be prepared for all major Democratic financiers to cash in stocks prior to the election, take advantage of your economic directives to undermine your success with our economy and drive down the stock market. As they sell off, major RNC groups need to buy them up.

225 2019-03-10 20:18:54 We know from what he has released that Sanders had a fourth house, that he pays lower taxes, gives little to charity, had high credit card debts, is invested in stocks... If his taxes were truly boring, he can join Warren, Gillibrand, Booker in releasing 10+ years of tax returns.
226 2019-03-10 20:18:36 E*TRADE, Schwab, et al charge $10 per transaction not per share to purchase stocks thru the financial markets/platform. Apple forces 30% and not anything less because they can

250 2019-03-10 19:50:44 (b) Much credit extended by banks is asset financing. Financing a productive asset such as a factory might look benign, but the tax deductibility of interest encourages high leverage, and when animal spirits are high, just as speculative as a punt on Chinese stocks.

262 2019-03-10 19:39:21 U.S. stocks declined last week on global growth concerns and a disappointing February jobs report. For the week, both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 fell 2.2% and the NASDAQ dropped 2.5%.

There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
268 2019-03-10 19:33:48 @Mafiabull some stocks u buy straight out so u don't worry about margin calls
269 2019-03-10 19:32:51 Do you eat sugar? Did you go to college? Do you have stocks? If your answer yes to one of those questions you benefited from slavery
270 2019-03-10 19:31:25 The stock market trades daily. The facts and fundamentals of stocks DO NOT CHANGE daily. What changes daily? The psychology of buyers and sellers CHANGES DAILY. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS WHEN A CRITICAL MASS OF BUYERS OR SELLERS OCCURS?
271 2019-03-10 19:31:09 This is literally, move for move, how @MorKsQC takes 80% of my stocks
272 2019-03-10 19:30:49 kutte ke stocks gir gaye ab blood pressure bhi gir jaye toh acha hoga buddha sala
273 2019-03-10 19:29:21 another 20% rule

when all of the personal computer stocks were getting crushed after the IPO cycle that peaked in 1983, we were standing around the Quotron (as we did then), and another young analyst said, "it's amazing how many times you can take 20% out of these things"
274 2019-03-10 19:25:34 Words for the Youth. Don’t take on a credit card at age 18 instead Buy Stocks. 
Go Build Credit (Bad Financial Advice) v/s Go Build Wealth (Good Financial Advice)"
275 2019-03-10 19:25:20 I think you simply buy stocks on mock trading which doesn't work in reality

288 2019-03-10 19:15:49 I honestly dont get the Raider hate. Both teams been laughing stocks for years. Was happy to see the Browns rise last year. If Raiders have a good offseason they could be on the same track. AB is a good start...elite WR1.
289 2019-03-10 19:15:21 No necessarily, I’ve been fortunate enough to own stocks others have FOMO’d and weren’t value anymore , trade deftly

291 2019-03-10 19:14:57 I hold TSLA at below $200, I like that stock, see potential, but I just got slapped in the face by the latest Nio announcement, I’ll refrain from giving advice. Overall I’m up, but haven’t done well last few months. I’m just holding right now, stocks are not how I make my living
292 2019-03-10 19:14:28 You could email the winery? Ask who stocks it?

296 2019-03-10 19:11:20 Really trying to use a portion of my check to buy stocks again I was doing so good last year
297 2019-03-10 19:10:41 Might ask if integrated real estate market: residential and commercial can make for 3rd leg of investment thesis with indexes/ETFs - stocks/income stmt., bonds/cash flow and real estate/balance sheet snapshot?
298 2019-03-10 19:07:44 i am a member of pro research i would like to try the pro trader. i dont want to trade options. but just stocks. is it possible with it. thanks
299 2019-03-10 19:04:46 Doesn’t look like a current chart based on the S&P index. I wouldn’t buy any stock unless I thought the MARKET was heading up. If market is not trending up, most breakouts in stocks are doomed or profits must be taken quicker.
300 2019-03-10 19:03:14 I can smoke your stocks for you, for a small fee of $.99 per lb.
301 2019-03-10 19:02:12 That's what the shops are going to tell the customers on 1st of April.. stocks out.. try some other time
302 2019-03-10 19:00:19 Love your honesty.  Unlike stocks, your past performance IS a guarantee of future success!
303 2019-03-10 18:59:17 Hard work, Stocks. Do you even know how that works. My guess is you do not. But I am glad to see you made it to town so you can join in on the free wifi from McDonald's.
304 2019-03-10 18:56:37 PLAYING IT TOO SAFE IN THE LONG TERM-The financial crisis has made many young investors overly cautious, An overly conservative approach to investing could stifle investment portfolio stocks which tend to outperform bonds over the long run - by a lot. #Business #Investing #Wealth
305 2019-03-10 18:56:23 Sunday’s are definitely for getting myself together...it’s my meal prep..organize my every day make up drawer day ...assess my workout plans and assess what stocks i will be trying to pick up this week and if the research backs a buy or a sell..definitely a productive day
306 2019-03-10 18:55:36 I find amusing that when (we) amateur #fintwit traders with few years of playing penny etc., stocks start believing that we know more than Fed and others in charge of their areas.

311 2019-03-10 18:50:50 People starts liking your products wants to buy wait for it go for a flash sale finally have to drop a plan. U may think people always keep trying your flashsales, but we are not fools. #MI #Xiaomi era will end up soon only coz of your flashsale strategy with limited stocks.
312 2019-03-10 18:50:11 Sully, 26% of the S&P is tech. About 11% in FAANG (5 stocks) is that really diversified? Also, we have something new to deal with. Anyone with a smart phone can short the s&p index. Machine trading can then kick in. It’s a whole new world out there.
313 2019-03-10 18:49:41 Maybe so...but even AAP has cumulatively not outperformed the S&P 500 index since 2001 according to a Wharton study. An investor could buy a few bad stocks and underperform the S&P.
314 2019-03-10 18:49:10 I also own stocks for that matter (and cash if any good opportunity arises) and I see a lot more risky now NOT having 1% of your portfolio in Bitcoin that having it...

But yeah, what do millenials know about anything...
315 2019-03-10 18:48:45 #Stocks,#Indexes ...traders acting collectively, unbeknownst to themselves, as an integrated, self-organizing process generate stock market tops and their inevitable manifestations, top signals. Unsignaled tops do not occur.
316 2019-03-10 18:48:20 Don’t know about that. Dips have been gobbled up since the offering at 19.  Some stocks like this tend to go up and never look back.
317 2019-03-10 18:45:43 The “Ides of March” (March 15) only applies to stocks, not crypto. 
318 2019-03-10 18:45:40 How do you in those large price stocks? when you are saying that you are making profit on those stocks, how many shares do you buy to make such profits?

321 2019-03-10 18:42:31 Its very true, but we realise only after rich and very expensive experience of beaten down by buying low PE / near 52 week - all time low stocks dreaming 10-20-100 bagger returns.
322 2019-03-10 18:42:26 #Stocks,#Indexes To be sure, one intransigent snag in the 2802 top signal remains. What then? Just as sure, it MUST be THE signal for the subsequent decline. Unsignaled decline? There has been none since 03.2000 (onset of our database). AND: millions of trades by SP500 stock...
323 2019-03-10 18:42:14 Marketing statergy and gaining profit is only not a motto of a successor. Customer satisfaction and future business planning also should be a motive of a no.1 seller. This time atleast have enough stocks before having a flashsale. 1s 2s or 3s somebody can wait nt mr dan dat.

"I make money off stocks, selling shit etc"
Sounds legit.
You were an A+ student who left college to trade stocks and sell shit?
LMAO
326 2019-03-10 18:38:37 I see a lot of misleading markers out there. Some stocks look good long and some  short. 
A lot of names "fake brokedown" back in December and have either came back into range or hit new ATH's 
Not inconceivable to see consolidation in leading names and b/o in more small caps
327 2019-03-10 18:36:51 Great point, I've thought this too. Especially when their profile seems a bit fishy to be a trader and their accounts look like they were created last week. #furu #manipulation #stocks
328 2019-03-10 18:35:53 watching a twitch clip where someone is saying another streamer is too political and doesn't have a personality (they were pointing out how good stocks doesnt mean a good economy) which is funny bc like 95% of most twitch streamers dont have a personality

336 2019-03-10 18:29:29 And what might the punishment be? How about ALL proceeds of the crime. Cash, stocks, buildings, equipment EVERYTHING! Then maybe DPA is warranted.
337 2019-03-10 18:29:09 Icahn voiced strong support for Trump at a time when many on Wall Street were deeply skeptical of the businessman. Icahn was such a fan of Trump that on election night, he literally left the victory party early to buy stocks that were crashing in the overnight markets.
338 2019-03-10 18:26:49 I'll happily explain it to you. Apple has an App Store that anyone can join to publish their apps to for $100 a year. Apple takes a 30% cut of all revenue generated by those apps. 

Apple also makes their own apps (like Stocks, Weather, Productivity) that they make free.
339 2019-03-10 18:26:48 You need to get some perspective Vaughany, we had an elected MP perjure herself over a driving offence and she got a couple of weeks - this was a pissed Peaky Blinder, just put him in the stocks outside the Bull Ring and toss rotten fruit at him

345 2019-03-10 18:19:34 Yes they still have a lot of stocks 
346 2019-03-10 18:17:39 Well, I hope we don’t run out of options anytime soon because at some point even the most prosperous stocks get affected unless carefully assesed and supplemented.
347 2019-03-10 18:17:00 "The reason 90 percent of investors and fund managers cannot pick stocks is simple: Whenever you buy or sell a stock or bond, there is someone on the other side of that trade, and that someone most likely has a name like Goldman Sachs, PIMCO, or Warren Buffett."

352 2019-03-10 18:13:21 Perhaps so. Bit similar to bitcoin. Do you go all in now and hope they’ll reach the final or do you swap to Barcelona stocks right now. Sticky situation actually.

365 2019-03-10 18:01:29 Many stocks if we may buy in the next 70 days, will never be at this price thereafter. Mid and small caps will lead the pack once again as usual during any year post elections. - Koushik, 10 th March 2019

382 2019-03-10 17:43:59 Wow it's another purge mixed with that other stupid movie where the neighbor stocks the other one. I guess nobody has any original ideas just copy cats off other movies that's why I don't watch movies anymore it's all the same BS with different people dumb.
383 2019-03-10 17:43:35 You can actually adjust your 401k however. Target fund dates have that similar format and adjust the closer you get to retirement but you can adjust it however youd like, such as “Intl large cap stocks, or emerging mkt stocks” so i would assume everyones is different.

385 2019-03-10 17:41:59 And it’s the weakest recovery due to high debt and generally poor demographics which means rates stay very low for a long time because growth will stay low for long time which makes growth stocks look a lot cheaper-more attractive than people realize= create another 2000. BAM!
386 2019-03-10 17:41:45 *VG QUERIES: Kridhan Infra:* Stock looks attractive @ current Valuations for a positional pick and steel stocks are also in focus these days so one can accumulate the stock in between 37.10-38.20 with a strict SL @close below 30 for a target price of 45-54-63 in a span of 6-9 mth
387 2019-03-10 17:41:19 401ks aren't straight into the index though it's like a regular portfolio 65% stocks and 35℅ bonds... If u look up the average growth rate of a 401k it's 5℅
388 2019-03-10 17:40:00 I understand very well that the African majority are marginalized in this economy, 80% of JSE stocks are owned by whites.

Don’t get disheartened & listen to everything & everyone you hear.
The markets have always been volatile. But never stayed below the line of resistance.

408 2019-03-10 17:19:19 More specifically tommorro I am looking at stocks that gapped down big on Friday then hit 20dayma and reversed to close higher.  If markets can bounce strongly all those names will be good enough for a quick daily gapfill.
409 2019-03-10 17:19:00 Can't say it was a bad news for you. I'm sure that we have plenty opportunities here, but all Brazilians good commodity traders that I known here went to Singapore.
Even so, you still invited to come and appreciate another markets, like stocks witch is improving.
De nada! 
410 2019-03-10 17:18:54 Hello, I am  buffet with a quick news update. Today Executive Official  Jeffrey Siegal of  Lifetime Brands stated in a press release, "The Democrats are pushing legislation that could impact the future shares of  AMZN stocks". Thank you for tuning into  CNBC.
411 2019-03-10 17:18:13 Didn't Peter Lynch famously reject the view that more holdings = market tracking returns? Had 150+ stocks in Magellan sometimes IIRC
412 2019-03-10 17:17:59 Ok great. Also wondering if I should stick to a few good stocks or keep buying as many as I like depending on their performance. I get attracted to many stocks & then exit when they seem to have topped but like to buy again when they look attractive. eg TCS, M&M, Bata, Jub Foods
413 2019-03-10 17:17:55 praying hard that the wallet and card holder I want from C&K have stocks in store  (I know it's not a praying emoji but this is the closest I can get )
414 2019-03-10 17:16:14 Debt and demographics lead to deflation. Low rates for much longer with low growth favors higher growth stocks until we get to a bubble like 2000!!

416 2019-03-10 17:14:22 It just popped up on mine this morning too but I quit watching. Not a single one stocks liquor. They'll never make it. Seriously, stuck in a bomb shelter with your fam 24/7 with no booze?!! Fake shit!

419 2019-03-10 17:12:49 Not sure ESG has anything to do with sin stocks. I think it has more to do with the environment, corp governance, and human / labor rights.

Otherwise he will be a 'hero' amongst his peers. I'm so glad I don't follow football.
423 2019-03-10 17:10:37 ‘Ripped away from their home’

More like thrown out of there home, because people tend to forget that it was Nintendo who didn’t want to buy the remaining stocks of Rare. Thus forcing them to look for another buyer.

If it wasn’t for Microsoft, Rare would be dead.

427 2019-03-10 17:07:56 If you side with pro-censorship pro-LAPD @latimes, you oppose freedom of the press and the First Amendment. Fight corruption inside the media—ask your Congressman to make it illegal for police agencies to buy newspaper stocks!
428 2019-03-10 17:06:09 Unless a good S&P index unit you get some Mad Money to grab few good stocks. SPX nice pullback last week.
429 2019-03-10 17:05:47 The year is 2000, Sisqo released his second single titled thong song, of his debut album unleash the dragon. Bruh, that shit was played all summer every where.  Thong stocks when up by 200 points. That's the year I realized I  was an ass man.  I like it when the beat goes...
430 2019-03-10 17:05:33 Same could be said for stocks/bonds. Very risky. Buying bitcoin/litecoin is an economic calculation.
431 2019-03-10 17:05:14 Maybe some of each.  Only Individual stocks that are growing faster then the  overall market or pay a higher reliable dividend. . Kraft  Heinz & GE aside. They are both loaded with debt.

433 2019-03-10 17:02:51 Indexes are super. All a matter  of choice. People should realize though that S&P indexes are weighted. What  is it, 20% of the SPYS are in the FAANG stocks?

436 2019-03-10 17:01:08 Yeah you guys are right, with securing stocks factored in, both her ledge trapping and edgeguarding aren’t as good

She’s also interesting to play defensively though, I’ve been trying it lately and it almost seems optimal? Not sure if it’s more fun tho

442 2019-03-10 16:58:09 Let's put it this way "only few stocks were rallying-managing index, overall market was down, after election result buyers turned sellers hence LC happened"
443 2019-03-10 16:56:20 I thought the dfs community was bad for cheering for injuries of opposing players, but the stock community is gleefully celebrating the crash of the Boeing 737 because they know when the market opens tomorrow, Boeing stocks will plummet.

446 2019-03-10 16:52:17 There's also the fact that a lot of gun violence in the U.S is pure accident. Actually ensuring that people who intend to own and use firearms are properly educated on how and when to use them would do wonders for reducing those numbers, but nah let's ban bump stocks.
447 2019-03-10 16:51:42 Le nucléaire pose des probléme que sont la radioactivité que vous ne vous pouvez pas nier ce qui représente un grand danger pour l'environnement. De plus, cet énergie est non-renouvelable ce qui fait que les stocks s'épuiseront au bout d'un moment et qu'il faut s'y préparer.
448 2019-03-10 16:51:19 Stick w/ indexes. Individual stocks are too hard in an industry that’s controlled by media sentiment and especially machine algos. You can’t trade fast enough to keep up w/ them. Too rigged against the retail investor.
449 2019-03-10 16:50:14 If you’re picking your own stocks, it best be your full time vocation. Or, use the 80/20 approach 80% index and 20% pick your own. Put fixed income in the 80% bucket.

451 2019-03-10 16:47:59 Breadth has had lower highs since Jan. It's divergence is so low that bulls have been calling it OVERSOLD. Transports, small caps, financials, all leading down. Stocks over 50dma, falling. Breadth story is done!
452 2019-03-10 16:46:16 What's worse is this is the second brand new 737- 8 Max to crash and Boeing hasn't grounded them worldwide till they find out why. Probably worried about their stock prices and balancing the settlements with orders canceled/devalued stocks
453 2019-03-10 16:46:14 Just curious about stocks, I never finished business.
454 2019-03-10 16:44:39 Apple earphone is top notch. Damn the bass is freaking good. Talking about that, I'm gonna have to buy some stocks before apple turns into airpods completely and stop produce the others. Do you want a pair?

464 2019-03-10 16:32:41 For the worse, look as job numbers in Feb, look at the deficit, look at the billions given to farmers as welfare due to tariffs, look at the stocks. Lies, deflection, denials and distraction are all you have left
465 2019-03-10 16:31:39 Adam, you would have so much fun selling into that market chaos. I loved seeing all those assholes WS types who told me I was “idiot” for believing this looking like scam (subprime) and didn’t help everyone was piling into stocks reaching all time high .

467 2019-03-10 16:29:55 A lot of buybacks are debt financed, which means all they are doing in pulling equity from future investors. Starting to feel like toxic debt financing of penny stocks. It will be interesting to see what the int. rate equilibrium is to start the mean reversion of which you speak.

471 2019-03-10 16:21:10 Incentivizing higher incarceration rates so share holders make a bigger dividend on other's misery. Holding stocks in the prison industries is one of the most destructive passive behaviors in today's world.
472 2019-03-10 16:20:45 Not to mention energy stocks have been pummeled for 4 years. I'm not saying we are due for an imminent bounce, but I do think these stocks have a major recovery in the near future. Divesting now would be a classic 'sell at the bottom' move.

Virgin Vinyl (pellets) as opposed to recycled PVC-inc trimmings,returns,crushed over stocks etc
Thicker pressing-140/180G

A better press than the shifty thin crap that was pressed during the Oil Crisis etc - those “Rudy Red”& Dynaflex
476 2019-03-10 16:15:52 It’s my 18th birthday!!! And I’m pretty pumped because I can do more things now gonna invest in some stocks jk but yeah it’s gonna be great
477 2019-03-10 16:15:27 As do stocks. But the MPA framework isn't the right mechanism to do it all. Scottish Government working with all stakeholders (including all fishermen) are in the position to make such decisions as appropriate.
478 2019-03-10 16:14:18 @Carmensfella has stated a few times on line that he has 150+ stocks. His top 15 used to make up C:65% though. It works for him!
479 2019-03-10 16:14:00 Aye - that's my current thinking.  Don't know yet.  Will mull over the options - putting people in the stocks in the village Square seems quite appealing actually.

493 2019-03-10 16:03:04 Crony capitalism at its best! Cheap fed money used to finance massive buybacks while execs unload their ridiculous, risk free stocks, awarded by straw man compensation committees, widening the wealth gap. The result will be full scale socialism.
494 2019-03-10 16:01:24 That ship has sailed a long time ago. Buying weed stocks is like buying bitcoin at $20k. Good luck

500 2019-03-10 15:56:36 So how do we tax assets? A vast amount of wealth is stored in stocks, bonds, and housing. In the case of stocks, we tax at point of sale, but what if you never sell? Should we confiscate some shares every year and sell for you on the open market? Genuine question.

503 2019-03-10 15:52:56 Agree.  Stock markets is not the economic barometer especially since over 50% of US POPULATION is not invested in stocks or bonds.

506 2019-03-10 15:49:36 Ive completely avoided stocks, & professional financial advisors. They are ok if you want a high risk high reward approach. Not for me. I researched the topic. I learnt about the randomness of success that stock/fund pickers have. I went all in with @Vanguard_Group mutual funds.
507 2019-03-10 15:49:16 Edge guarding is still too hard in ultimate. Getting the KO in general for me at least. I lose too many games because I can’t end stocks fast enough despite beating my opponents in neutral way more often. 

Because of this, I’m liking doubles way more :/.

510 2019-03-10 15:47:11 I worry that profit margins will mean regress; they always have. I disagree that buybacks have been non-distorting. They have put a serious bid under stocks that seems likely to be a big part of the race up in valuations. I think buybacks are very distorting.
511 2019-03-10 15:44:06 Ah finalement 2, les stocks sont épuisés  apparemment

If it’s not justified and they’ve ‘gone rogue’ I’ll be first in line at the stocks. Gives us a bad name.

526 2019-03-10 15:26:33 And they're threatening to keep their trawlers in our waters and confront our RN. We were told by NATO to get out of icelands waters; what's different? Irish fishermen also suffering through EU laws that give EU fishermen a right to take their fish stocks; Fishing is our asset!

530 2019-03-10 15:25:09 So this is how we make America great again?
By being patsies to N. Korea, the Saudis, China and Russia?
Trump and America are now laughing stocks of the planet.
Let's really make America great........Impeach Trump!

535 2019-03-10 15:19:18 Individuals who knew about the use of Boeing planes used in 9/11 made millions on betting against the company. As if you and I place a put options on bank stocks before the 2008 crash we would be millionaires. What they teach in school is totally different than the real world.

539 2019-03-10 15:18:36 Stocks jump on news of US-China trade truce

New York (CNN Business)A cease fire is better than a trade war, and stocks jumped higher after the United States and China said they would stand down on further tariffs and continue talking about their differences. Dow futures soared n

541 2019-03-10 15:15:38 $30 trillion+ is the amount of wealth created by stocks in the last decade, wealthiest 10% of USA families wealth grew by double digit %, median American family wealth dropped by 34%. #uhoh #economy #stocks #wealth #wealthdestruction
542 2019-03-10 15:14:48 Investing in penny stocks is great, but being blindsided by a pump and dump can be devastating. Do your research, check for disclaimers.  If you see a disclaimer stay away.
543 2019-03-10 15:14:39 What. you must be joking right? Obama and Hillary and every friggin left wing hack said the economy would tank and the stocks would go down if trump was elected. So when will it no longer be Obama's economy? I thought that was a few months ago when the market adjusted?
544 2019-03-10 15:13:55 Every @kroger store in my area under stocks asiago cheese bagels from the bakery. They're all snatched up rapidly, while plenty of other kinds remain available. Your customers clearly want asiago bagels more than the others. Please plan accordingly.

546 2019-03-10 15:12:37 You need to realise this is stocks and shares. Learn how stocks are effected and you will very quickly learn the index, this isn't Opta stats or fantasy football its stock trading. Grealish's rise is perfectly predictable given what happened today.

551 2019-03-10 15:10:51 Off the top of my head, they could provide free full ammunition stocks, perhaps install and recharge some sort of super-shield that would make you more durable in fights (making a trip to base before a big anticipated battle a useful thing), and maybe let you make other upgrades?

557 2019-03-10 15:03:42 Success of a company or stocks is not how you measure the success of our nation. The Dow is not much to meaure success by for a President. Honestly if he's measuring his success by the dow and the happiness of corporations he's doing it wrong.

613 2019-03-10 14:24:53 I’m in quite a bad mood today mainly because I’m fucking exhausted, the kids have trashed the flat and eaten all the food I bought yesterday for pack lunches so now I need to do tons of cleaning and then walk a mile and a half in horrific weather to replenish food stocks. Fml.
614 2019-03-10 14:21:18 I started this up again to watch everyone that trade penny stocks. I followed them all. Sorry friends this is not for you this account is just for me and what I need out of it. So if you add me I won't post unless it's and day trading! This will be a good info site for me.
615 2019-03-10 14:19:38 The lower real interest rates go, the deeper people go into debt. Who had 40k savings, has now 200k mortgage. Interests are low, but people have to payback principle. Money invested in overpriced houses & stocks, can't be spent in CPI relevant goods: CPI goes lower, rates follow.

621 2019-03-10 14:13:05 Yeah I am you like 20 years later. Tbh learn stocks. IQ and lack of focus works there
622 2019-03-10 14:12:51 I would distinguish between ‘sin’ stocks (gambling, tobacco, alcohol, firearms) and stocks that may not pass an ESG screen. For investors, the G is the most important component that has been shown to impact returns.
623 2019-03-10 14:12:42 Short capital gains are already taxed at your income bracket, Senator Schatz wants to tax #stocks/#bonds on both buys & sells as well.

626 2019-03-10 14:09:56 Stocks are about to bump up for a bit. More market manipulation by our Chief deceiver.
627 2019-03-10 14:09:34 Yes. If Chile's SWF divested from copper stocks to avoid over-weighting, does this tell us anything about the future outlook for copper?
628 2019-03-10 14:09:24 Yesterday listening @hiddengemsindia  sir in YouTube and the most important point which is similar to your point that good fundamental stocks out of favour is the real opportunity to accumulate.

630 2019-03-10 14:07:23 It seems to me that these people can't think on their own, now Camel Harris is saying the same thing Cortez said, and as far as the stock market goes, Camel you need to learn how that works, you don't have to own stocks in order to profit..

637 2019-03-10 14:03:17 Why did the GOP argue that the tax cuts would lead to wage growth?  Because raising stock prices favors the wealthy.  Most don’t own stocks
638 2019-03-10 14:03:08 Try to look at demand and and stocks. Listen to the experts. Pick a time to sell then some politicians get involve and all the planning and analyzing goes out the window. Farmers will lose money on the Chinese issue. I guess we wait for government to fix it.

643 2019-03-10 14:01:00 84% of all stocks are owned by the Richest 10% of the population.
But when the stock market tanks the rich get bailed out. 

The poor: 
lose houses, 
retirement funds, 
and sometimes their lives.

650 2019-03-10 13:51:54 I feel the day it crosses 205 it will fire. Hotel stocks in flavour. Be it lemon tree, sinclairs, indian hotels, royal orchid also.
651 2019-03-10 13:51:53 They have to, they keep a $$ percentage of all stocks and when it goes up they sell, n buy back lower, read their info..
652 2019-03-10 13:50:50 Unfortunately no. I'm in Finland 

But it's just a thought that when stocks might not perform, there could be other instruments that might.

I'm currently quite heavily invested in crowdlending, but they're pretty risky an unregulated.


653 2019-03-10 13:50:18 Hace seis meses q las automotrices están liquidando stocks y un año y medio con bonificaciones. Lo aclaro x si alguien creyó q agarró un diario viejo. Es de hoy.
654 2019-03-10 13:49:59 Please explain where someone making $200k a year with no children dependents puts his $... Banks? Stocks?

Housing is modest. He lives in Vermont, works in DC, and has vacation for entire extended family. Should he be renting instead to make you happy?
655 2019-03-10 13:49:42 And 100% will poll that we think all politicians are shady.  Seriously, let’s just expose all.  Lets make it illegal for @SpeakerPelosi to buy and sell stocks based on her “insider” knowledge, investigate associates of Ed Buck, Epstein, and terrorist supporter/brother lover.

664 2019-03-10 13:40:27 Additionally, if earnings look iffy in 2019 due to currency AND margin issues, shifting some $ into 2019 might eventually make stocks higher than if the earnings were lumpy or if growth was lower.
665 2019-03-10 13:40:04 Let me tell you, it does not happen 99.9999% of times. In fact probability of making a living on penny stocks is less than 99.999%

668 2019-03-10 13:38:29 so what cn you say about this to new traders sir..
669 2019-03-10 13:38:24 If you steal $1 million and make $2 million trading stocks, the $2 million is yours. However, if caught, you would go to prison for stealing $1 million, and would have to return it, plus any punitive damages awarded by the court. Capitalism plays no dubious or guilty role.
670 2019-03-10 13:37:44 My prediction is that 50K target, It's one of my 3 stocks portfolio 
671 2019-03-10 13:37:26 The real core issue is not whether bump stocks stay or go it whether the Feds have the right to redefine legislation. And this is happening under a republican president what could we expect under a leftist government.
672 2019-03-10 13:36:44 Right.  Just that often financial markets just talk about the popular kids, like “with the stocks of FB, Apple, Goolge doing Xxx we will Yyy” and always feels like “hey hey what about Microsoft?”
673 2019-03-10 13:36:43 Shivam sir pls suggest some best stocks

675 2019-03-10 13:35:40 In 2011, almost 70% of stocks in the S&P500 had corrected over 20% from their peaks. Also, by the beginning of 2016, 63% of stocks in the S&P500 had corrected by over 20% from their top. 

2018 - 19% correction
676 2019-03-10 13:35:17 You have a cheap loan, so if you believe you can get an interest higher than it from somewhere, then I'd risk it and not pay off a cheap mortgage.

But I wouldn't invest in stocks right now, I'm afraid returns will be negative for a while. Real estate an option?
677 2019-03-10 13:34:59 Very well said. I spent so many years in finding strategy & finally stopped at this. Mental tuffness...  Psychology is most important factor which drive ur trading, decision making.

695 2019-03-10 13:18:24 The idea that stocks with certain characteristics (value, small cap) have outperformed over time is not new. But my exploration of this issue does not mean I believe investors should use smart beta strategies. My skepticism is explicit in the podcast and on my blog.

729 2019-03-10 12:39:11 @BBCNews in general is biased. Not the neutral observer with balanced reporting it once was. Rarely watch it these days.
730 2019-03-10 12:37:48 For swing trades, I usually avoid the stocks that are excessively talked about on Twitter.
731 2019-03-10 12:36:54 It may not happen now, although I'd bet it will during the upcoming months, but sooner or later - it surely well.
My idea behind this long is that there was finally a correction that took place, and overall stocks are cheap if you look at real return of risk free bonds.

743 2019-03-10 12:20:54 4th, no campaign contributions from lobbyists, special interests groups, foreign interests, large corporations. Use the Stock markets definition of small caps stocks and lower so threshold is created so a maximum threshold is established

745 2019-03-10 12:18:08 @cspanwj Bloomberg just yesterday covered the difference in performance as much as 200% between stocks with marginally lower service fees, how will this tax affect the market if it increases cost?

755 2019-03-10 11:57:58 So dollar stores began to open everywhere, their stocks went way up, etc... When the economy tanked and people began to lose jobs.

767 2019-03-10 11:40:47 Thanks for the info. Has the point been considered that actions burning large quantities of the supply might externalise compliance risks onto exchanges by making coins more security-like?

846 2019-03-10 09:47:27 Yes, but no depth in big stocks though. English/Schache are still developing, Naughton is a star who could use a second big fella to help down back, Boyd's unreliable and is Trengove that second key defender or ruck? Hopefully Jordon Sweet develops fast. Maybe he's the answer?

894 2019-03-10 08:31:29 99% of retail inv who got in after 2015 only know this slope and they think this is perfectly normal / logical thanks to @federalreserve making saving stocks job 1. Most of the pretty charts shown in Twitter only consider this period of time. Chart chasers meet history & reality

899 2019-03-10 08:29:09 When stocks are attractive, you buy them. Sure, they can go lower. I've bought stocks at $12 that went to $2, but then they later went to $30. You just don't know when you can find the bottom.

905 2019-03-10 08:23:59 U asked are they "FDIC insured"?  No crypto exchange nor stock exchanges are #FDIC insured. US banks are FDIC insured.  

Investments (stocks, crypto) insurance policy? NO.

I remember when the US banks crashed in 2008. US tax payers had to bail them out. FDIC is fake comfort.

951 2019-03-10 07:06:21 What was MIC doing? Converting the reduction to cash and stocks.
952 2019-03-10 07:04:52 Sometimes I ponder and I realize what I have now vs back then and I have quite a lot going for me. I’m not broke anymore, I invest money in stocks and put some away in savings with a high APY. I work with smart field grade officers that teach me what they know.
953 2019-03-10 07:01:29 Hello! I will post the final tweet for Moderato and Andate stocks in a while.. super limited lang yung stocks so make sure you turn your notifications on 
954 2019-03-10 07:00:07 @manukumarjain had a chance to do a quick handshake and intro with you in B'lore last week at the hotel I was staying. Congratulations on #RedmiNote7Pro and I'm awaiting for 13th Mar to get my hands on it. Hope there are enough stocks 
955 2019-03-10 06:58:12 I bet @BIGMONEYMIKE6 penny stocks pay better than your job.quit that low paying job and invest in his stocks! Easy money #pennystock #moneyflip #PENNYSTOCK #pennystockcult #march12th #Alert #MONEYGANG
956 2019-03-10 06:55:49 I mostly day trade momentum stocks. That usually consists of stock under $10. I'm starting to branch out and swing trade as well, which includes higher priced stocks.
957 2019-03-10 06:54:47 $JPM still very attractive ended week #trading at $103.01 #dividend #yield 3.11% or 0.80 a share a quarter YTD return 5.52% 1 year return -10.22% Still #Bullish #stocks #StockMarket #investing #investments #WallStreet #Finance #BuildingWealth #economics #economy
958 2019-03-10 06:54:35 As per my understanding, the stocks hitting new high will lead this bull market. Let me know, if I am wrong.

965 2019-03-10 06:46:55 I bought a little over budget, a year and a half to go.  Wish I could downsize or make a basement rental, my property isn’t set up appropriately.

971 2019-03-10 06:42:12 Automatics are very rare and expensive and bump stocks are a novelty. Have you fired a hand gun or an AR? I dont want to drop into an arguement where we call each other names. I dont know your experience. Ive used both as a civ and a soldier. Both have a place.
972 2019-03-10 06:42:09 Fun fact: in the bull market from 1921 to 1929 stocks rose almost 500% while same time period saw deflation mainly due to productivity gains from electricity adoption. 

The Fed today has stopped all ‘good deflation’ thus robbing households of increased living standards.
973 2019-03-10 06:42:08 What we need are regulators who spot and stop this sort of nonsense early on....

1014 2019-03-10 06:06:24 2018 was a good year 2019 was personally busy couldn't get my head in the right space. Didn't get a chance to look into my accounts but i did know i had a lot of other stocks in my account i needed to purge. Found the time last week to go on a selling spree. 1/2
1015 2019-03-10 06:05:10 Stock market is unstable but positive for now. Watch stocks carefully and make the money while you can in march and april. #stockmarkets #investments #bubble #getupradiomedia

1017 2019-03-10 06:04:49 We need a good Republican to run. 

PS: Did you see that the Trump administration banned bump stocks  and people have until March 19th to turn them in or destroy them?
Who’s gonna keep track of that? Will people get reimbursed if they turn them in?
1018 2019-03-10 06:03:33 Just spoke with my wife we have an ambitious goal of buying $1000 dollar worth of cannabis stocks every month for the next 10 years.

1019 2019-03-10 06:03:09 Quite the contrary it was fraud on a huge scale. Looting the stock market on the up and on the down. The many lost. The few gained. Not satisfied, they qei ii iii bought back the stocks at a penny to the 1000s of $. And promoted the villains.

1033 2019-03-10 05:51:49 I had the weirdest set with DankDDD today:

Game 1 - He 3-stocks me
Game 2 - I almost 3-stock him, he makes the comeback, but I clutch it out last hit
Game 3 - He almost 3-stocks me, but I make the 3-stock comeback

The games were almost never even.

1041 2019-03-10 05:46:27 Bogle had 3 components of return -- dividend yield, earnings per share growth, and where the PE ratio will be. Those components move from least to the most speculative.

If owning stocks is speculating on how speculative others will be, isn't that like owning gold?

1128 2019-03-10 03:54:20 If you take every dollar and magically liquidate every asset (stocks, property, art, etc.) at 100%, you dont even get 1 year at current spending levels. No debt reduction, and noone left to own or operate business and pay people. Game over.

1136 2019-03-10 03:44:37 Sears took the handout then went out of business. Many company bought back stocks. Very little went to employees. And many middle class people got back smaller tax returns.
1137 2019-03-10 03:44:13 But debt is up, GDP is down, and stocks are down. Plants are closing farmers are on welfare. Yes? Oh and... I am not your enemy or an enemy of America. 
1138 2019-03-10 03:43:48 These are all great books - one of the most pivotal/enjoyable books for me (when it comes to trading psychology) was Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.  Which is an anecdotal account of Jesse Livermore’s rags to riches trading stocks.

1142 2019-03-10 03:36:56 Yeah, they reissued the original Optimus, without trailer, in a Hot Rod-reissue sized box. He's been showing up at WalMart's recently. Our WalMart only had one or two stocks of the minibots it seems, unfortunately.

1146 2019-03-10 03:32:30 Right, R's will never divest their health ins stocks as long as they turn big profits.  So,  looks like it's time to make those stocks no longer profitable.  MFA means  growth for small businesses & more discretionary income  for consumers

1152 2019-03-10 03:25:36 Imagine making a game and thinking, "hey! Lets make this gun have 2 stocks so you look like a rabbit on crack strafing. Oh this gun 2 quickdraws, but this other AR no stock but we'll give it zero recoil." This game makes kids who are terrible, think they're the best.
1153 2019-03-10 03:25:25 Same goes for "non-growth" stocks too. Lots think that if a business cannot grow its sales every year, there's no value in it.

Then for growth stocks, they overpay for perceived growth and world domination that might never come.

(And I actually agree with you). People thought I was crazy when I said very low feed rates and balance sheet expansion would last more a decade but would drive real estate and stocks to new all time highs... ironically NOT a bubble

1164 2019-03-10 03:12:01 It's not about science. In fact it's abt elite co-opting a movement while keeping the same practices & enforcing it as green. While you dis-invest from BigOil (McGibbens disinvestment tour) theyre buying up stocks & banks throw $ in 2 increase their value. You haven't read this.
1165 2019-03-10 03:11:59 No mocking was intended, sorry.  In NIPA, the double entry principle is embedded in "income" vs. "product"  Unlike private sector financial accounting, NIPA does not have its eye on the relation of flows to stocks, i.e., income statement to balance sheet.

1167 2019-03-10 03:07:00 Abolish the NYSE, end the FED, and return to a non-fractional reserve fiat bank similar to the Colonial Scrip advocated by Ben Franklin.  (modern, digital version of course).  We don't need a stock exchange, people's stocks should be savings accounts, businesses should loan money
1168 2019-03-10 03:03:44 Only thing which matters is the US Dollar and Dollar Index $DXY, every thing else is hostage to the US Dollar
Don't waste your time, just watch what the US Dollar does, likely to be up over next many months
Bad news for EM,  Gold,Silver , Base metal and Energy stocks
1169 2019-03-10 03:02:51 The next big drop is definitely coming. Because of overvalued stocks, we chose to pay off home first. If stocks drop by 10% or more I will likely modify that plan. If they drop by more than 20%. I’ll pay min on mortgage and rest on stocks.
1170 2019-03-10 03:01:45 Your comment is meaningless. If a significant % of people try to sell any asset of course liquidity will dry up and prices go down. Also many stocks will pay you dividends that don’t depend on where the stock is trading. Finally, value is nothing more than projected future cash.
1171 2019-03-10 03:00:52 Tight one for me. 

#3 for Brandan Parfitt (stocks set to rise) or;

1183 2019-03-10 02:55:06 How about all the educated economists say the economy is great.. You don't need to own stocks to realize that.. Not true most folks only have one job. And the unemployed are finding better paying jobs..  Please stop with the negative , dire fear mongoring.
1184 2019-03-10 02:53:55 Thi is similar to what @Financialplgrm recommended. I think it covers the best of both worlds. If stocks continue to be high, this could be very advantageous. Thanks for sharing!
1185 2019-03-10 02:52:57 therefore the prize-money painful reductions and over-racing of current stocks, of the past few years, have actually been unnecessary for the country circuit by way of reducing the 26m debt with the otherwise well planned land sales..

1196 2019-03-10 02:46:30 I was able to buy a stock of my favorite game company nintendo. For me and the people i know who use it, its like dipping your toe in stocks. Not the endgame but a good place to start imo.

1198 2019-03-10 02:43:36 Your strategy to only launch limited stocks and then keep the customers waiting for anither date is not right. You will loose out to competitors who are offering great deals & features with no gimmick of launching few units on flash sales.
1199 2019-03-10 02:41:43 We took loans big guy. We sold everything we could, we liquidated our stocks and savings. The kids in service all waited their turn. Waitlists for adequate funding are fair, underfunding everyone is not. Use your head.

1202 2019-03-10 02:39:48 It’s not really about that. It’s about a guy who rips people off selling fake stocks but before he did that he ran a casino out of his house. It’s a great movie even though it has Ben Affleck.
1203 2019-03-10 02:39:38 That and the S&P 500 is looking to retrace, and pot stocks have historically sold off between March and April. But I'm going to stick to the technicals and try to tune out the noise. Trulieve should have earning coming up and that will make things interesting.

1205 2019-03-10 02:37:21 I don't prefer low float stocks for trading. Any view less than 8 yrs is mere speculating. 
I rather prefer options and double in 3-4 days.

1207 2019-03-10 02:34:23 My greatest lessons from investing have nothing to do with stocks.

Markets taught me to be humble. Markets taught me how to accept things I can't control. Markets taught me how to take a loss and let go. Markets taught me how to treat highs and lows with equanimity.

1213 2019-03-10 02:26:17 Well...stocks go up and stocks go down. And December was one of those months where stocks went down. Why would you go long when stocks are going down?

1216 2019-03-10 02:23:46 Facebook is one of the FANG stocks...  It's networth is worth more than this entire crypto market. Bitcoin has no marketing. It's very possible a Facebook coin could exceed BTC in marketcap.
1217 2019-03-10 02:23:00 That means that the households in the study were made up of capitalists who own stocks. So, they would get totally wiped out if socialists took over, but why not vote for Bernie and his copy cats anyway.

1244 2019-03-10 01:53:49 Hi mate, yes possibly. But it’s a typical spec stock that will parabolically rise and then guess what. There is risk of a  massive gap down so I generally don’t hold stocks overnight. Not because it won’t go up, it’s just risk management
1245 2019-03-10 01:53:46 I’ve been watching the stocks for about 2 or 3 weeks now.... & i THINK I’m starting to understand 
1246 2019-03-10 01:53:18 How’s that “trickle down” theory working out for the umteenth time? 

FACTS:

#GOPTaxScam favored the .1%

Corporations automated and bought back smtheir own stocks

National Debt is skyrocketing over of said tax scam

Job and housing markets sluggish

ARE WE WINNING YET? #MAGA
1247 2019-03-10 01:52:36 Well said. If nobody posted about the stocks they were excited about, we wouldnt have much of a fintwit community. But there is no need to post your level of wealth. You're not "teaching" or "benefiting" anyone. Completely self serving.
1248 2019-03-10 01:48:31 We had .com 1.0 stocks instead of cryptocurrencies in the '90s. The irrational exuberance was so infectious, I somehow ended-up paying $27 a share for InfoSpace.
1249 2019-03-10 01:46:25 Have a think mate, you're one of the reasons that "Great" Britain is now one of the laughing stocks of the world & is just about to be renamed UKistan.
1250 2019-03-10 01:41:10 They have to push their non moving stocks shhh. 
1251 2019-03-10 01:40:54 The context of advertising product really sucks. It does, but what it has managed to uncover is the fact, that people are so afraid of owning and accepting the bitter truth of this society.! R.i.p @HUL_News your stocks are gonna sink really deep this quarter. #Boycotthindustan
1252 2019-03-10 01:40:15 My boyfriend asks for help figuring out stocks & taxes, but then tells me I’m wrong when I tell him what I know. I even looked it up to check myself, but he says I’m still wrong. F*ck my math degree & basic investment knowledge, right? #SorryForTheRant
1253 2019-03-10 01:39:36 During the festival season, there is the looming threat of yakisoba sets reaching low stocks.
1254 2019-03-10 01:39:25 1/2 of US population has no investments in stocks
1255 2019-03-10 01:36:07 In demand ang balde ngayon.out of stocks na ang iba.
1256 2019-03-10 01:36:06 I'm assuming that those aren't stocks made by you. Let me know if that's not the case.
1257 2019-03-10 01:35:22 Other than 401K most people don’t have money laying around to buy stocks
1258 2019-03-10 01:34:04 I had Bre-X stocks too.  So the federal government should have made sure I never lost my investment.  Gimme a break. Corrupt is corrupt.  If my current pension plan has SNC stock, my loss.   But the investment managers should have dumped it by now.
1259 2019-03-10 01:32:08 Extracting? Sharing costs? What is your objection?  You realize after  WWII the USA was world's #1 Creditor, had 2/3rds of the world's gold  stocks and 50% of worlds manufacturing. Now we're the world's largest  debtor. From there to here, something has to change.
1260 2019-03-10 01:32:07 Hi! We're sorry but we still don't have available copies of The Wolf and the Watchman  in our stores. If you want we could add you to our Order List so we can inform you if we already have stocks. If you are interested. Kindly, send us a DM! :)

1262 2019-03-10 01:30:51 are these original stocks?
1263 2019-03-10 01:29:28 it is almost summer so people should look at payroll company's stock I have watched these stocks for along time but in the end it is up to you to watch and make up your own mind I do not own any stocks

1265 2019-03-10 01:26:03 @sprint Ever since I was a T mobile member. I have been watching the stocks. The last Sprint stock I seen the was down by 18-. How do I know T Mobile was down 14-. Verizon up+ At&t Up+. That is why I thought it was funny. Stocks down and your turning away down pay and monthly pay
1266 2019-03-10 01:24:59 Tambien convengamos que la empresa no cuenta con “stocks” y las alternativas a ofrecer son las que brinda la aerolinea. Es el drama de comprar uno por un lado y otro por el otro 
1267 2019-03-10 01:24:17 Il faut bien écouler les stocks... 
1268 2019-03-10 01:23:53 Which site do you visit to get list of stocks for such filters?
1269 2019-03-10 01:20:03 It's blocked for me.  So sick of this crap.  Must be crazy eyes.  I swear I'm getting rid of cable.  Stocks are way more intetesting.
1270 2019-03-10 01:19:54 Many actually think they are. Stocks up, unemployment down, hunger down (supposedly), etc. That's the mantra. Essentially since most trump supporters aren't seeing this wonderful (sarcasm) economy.
1271 2019-03-10 01:19:13 Colonel Sandurz, set a course for Planet Ethanol. Our stocks are running low.
1272 2019-03-10 01:18:37 They would fix with windows stocks ??   
1273 2019-03-10 01:18:31 Bolton has always been a fan of low yield nukes. I think Trump just sees a way to help enrich his buddies — would be worth looking into which of them bought a bunch of defense stocks recently
1274 2019-03-10 01:18:07 The bull market is over. Get out of stocks.
1275 2019-03-10 01:17:32 It's just bad marketing. If you make a name for yourself as a short-seller, don't risk your reputation trying to pick a bounce in shitty stocks.
1276 2019-03-10 01:16:27 What if we start dumping your stocks? You were trading at the close of business at 27. If we start selling our holdings maybe, just maybe, youll start taking our concerns seriously.

1279 2019-03-10 01:15:38 Just cause nobody in your family has really reached any success doesn’t mean that have to be your life too. Be that difference for ya family. Do what the generations prior didn’t do. Go to college, own a business, get into stocks, idk find something but don’t hate
1280 2019-03-10 01:13:00 Lmao not beholden to lobbyists or special interests groups? That’s insane. What issue has he tackled? He banned bump stocks and recalled troops but everything else has been a disaster
1281 2019-03-10 01:09:51 lol, thats not true at all. He made a comment about internet stocks, and then there was an internet stock bubble burst "Dizzy"

1290 2019-03-10 01:01:53 This is something I noticed and between stocks sometimes I need time to just re-assess and re-compose so this is terrible for me tbh, invincibility should be the same no matter how long you’re on the plat

1292 2019-03-10 00:59:37 K-elf own stocks at SM Ent have been ten years ago. SM have many other groups now. SM doesn’t care about suju&elf.
1293 2019-03-10 00:58:45 It probably hasn't been seriously brought up in a court of law yet, because of the 10 year bull market (most stocks go up), but imagine if challenged the company could be found liable for not allowing diversification.
1294 2019-03-10 00:57:50 Bruh lmao times have seriously changed and why I usually just grind out work and game and trade stocks. 

Shit is just too wild now
1295 2019-03-10 00:55:24 So this basically means dont go long for any type of small scalp because everyone is already looking to short shoppers from now on, at every possible uptick. So that said, I will be looking at other stocks 
1296 2019-03-10 00:54:18 Evan McMullin is the political equivalent of a financial advisor who has turned $500,000 cash in to $50,000 in stocks $ bonds, then telling us how ridiculously dumb warren buffet is.
1297 2019-03-10 00:54:02 私たちの株式投資への意欲をなくさせるような要因がかなりある。
There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. (131)
1298 2019-03-10 00:52:00 Please tell me I didn't just hear you say the stock market is only profitable if you own stocks? Really? Economics 101...public traded companies are the ones hiring people to fill those jobs. Pres candidate? Hmmm!
1299 2019-03-10 00:51:51 Doucement tout de même, les stocks commencent à être menacés 
1300 2019-03-10 00:51:50 The difference is that preferred stocks pay an agreed-upon dividend at regular intervals. ... Common stocks may pay dividends depending on how profitable the company is. Preferred stock dividends are often higher than common stock dividends.
1301 2019-03-10 00:51:20 and without the daily scandals and excessive Executive overreach. Mexico was supposed to pay, member? Never mind the banning of bump stocks and red flag laws. I'm not sure how you don't hate him more than we do
1302 2019-03-10 00:49:50 The stock market is a reflection of the wealth of the wealthy. Flood the market with enough borrowed money and let c suite execs raise their bonuses via buy backs and voila, stocks go higher.
1303 2019-03-10 00:46:31 Actually, never had rabbit.
I think at least one butcher shop at the West Side Market stocks the carcasses... But other than that, only bunny bits for sale around here are the furs and paws. (I actually still have a couple hides from the last sale on them at Tandy...)
1304 2019-03-10 00:46:16 If SM throw them out, SM will be at lost. Don't you know Elf own stocks at SM Ent? 
Let's have some faith in them. We are their everlasting friends.

1308 2019-03-10 00:43:22 Oliver, the Class 313's don't run to Peterborough and GTR has just recently replace there old rolling stocks for new, the class 387's and 700's and as for the Class 365's, they are 1994 stock.

1310 2019-03-10 00:40:32 #simonbaker I would sell my house, get all of my savings and all of my stocks and bonds and give it all to you if you could just fall in love with me for just one single night.
1311 2019-03-10 00:39:26 Pretty sure macmillan got hurt in JLT 2 so downgrade him to a rookie and bolster those ruck stocks! Don’t love McCarthy but he’s reasonably cheap and you seem to like him :)
1312 2019-03-10 00:39:02 $SPY Many traders no doubt sold their stocks at the open. Doesn't mean it's too late. I get it. I've been there and done that like any trader has at some point. Emotions often take over and it's not easy to buy back in again but don't stay mad at the market, take advantage.
1313 2019-03-10 00:38:41 BeefySmashDoods comes out with a video on what to do when you take your opponents stock. Now everybody in Elite Smash is running to the ledge when they take stocks. I'm not approaching that tactic guys.

1326 2019-03-10 00:26:03 2. you know exactly what your loan rate will be, fixed.
3. I would go all in on the mortgage, and reconsider shifting some to stocks when values come back down to reasonable levels. 
4. The 2000s had a neg annualized return. It will happen again. 
5. Debt free is forever.
1327 2019-03-10 00:25:35 My experience is that Cushing levels have little affect on WTI pricing below ~80% storage capacity. That was certainly the case in 2015-early 2017. Then, I watched Cushing stocks like a hawk. Not so much now. Please show me why there is a takeaway problem now. Thanks.
1328 2019-03-10 00:22:37 Would love your expert opinion on Pot Stocks...
And of course I am very willing to contact Asshole Consulting and pose this question....
1329 2019-03-10 00:22:24 I agree. Just pointing out it's stupid to blame Trump for something he most likely knows nothing about.

Just like conservatives bashed Obama because bump stocks were approved during his presidency.

I am 100% positive he knew nothing about it.
1330 2019-03-10 00:21:14 There’s no right answer because we don’t know the future. My 2 cents, 1) at best the stock market will give 5.5-6.0% CAGR after taxes (7% before taxes based on historical data). Based on current CAPE ratios, US stocks are quite overvalued, so probably less return over next decade
1331 2019-03-10 00:19:43 Don’t follow it much. These crazy PE stocks are high again - too much knee-jerk reaction risk to news - real or fake
1332 2019-03-10 00:18:21 Forward PE estimates. That’s how CNBC can claim stocks are cheap.

1338 2019-03-10 00:12:38 Not sure banning bump stocks is a fascist thing, but that aside...

If you agree that Trump is a fascist, then what's the problem with calling his supporters "fascist supporters?"
1339 2019-03-10 00:12:28 9000 jobs aren’t at stake. They will go to whatever company gets the job. 

What is at stake are corporate profit-sharing & the value of stocks held by execs.

1354 2019-03-09 23:57:35 FACT: The MAJORITY of the money corporations got was spent on stocks buy backs. the middle class got peanuts which is why Trump floated a 10% cut during the mid terms and abandoned it for the fear mongering of the caravan.
1355 2019-03-09 23:57:31 Thank you, I used cmlviz trade machine in the past for options and am looking forward to the technical based strats for stocks. Options haven't worked out for me due to the sample size and larger losses (40% stops) needed to cater to the volatility due to being leveraged.

1358 2019-03-09 23:55:36 Yeah, we needed this pullback...a lot of stocks had just been going straight up.  Hopefully, the next leg up will be just as powerful.
1359 2019-03-09 23:55:08 So sad. They get money from stocks and shares taken from drug companies and weapons factories. On top of not paying a cent in taxes.

1375 2019-03-09 23:56:23 I doubt it'll be a straight back in the indices but for many individual stocks, I don't see why not!
1376 2019-03-09 23:55:36 Yeah, we needed this pullback...a lot of stocks had just been going straight up.  Hopefully, the next leg up will be just as powerful.
1377 2019-03-09 23:55:08 So sad. They get money from stocks and shares taken from drug companies and weapons factories. On top of not paying a cent in taxes.

1385 2019-03-09 23:49:46 You’re a businessman who makes money selling AAP subscriptions, Real Money,  and books regardless if the market goes up or down. If AAP subscribers who buy more AAP stocks that lose money than AAP stocks that make money tweet a comment about that, does that make them “haters”?

1388 2019-03-09 23:48:08 I finally heard back from one of my summer stocks and I kinda wanna vomit and kinda wanna cry and kinda wanna laugh
1389 2019-03-09 23:48:03 Those would also apply to stocks and etfs? I'm more interested in technical based stocks and etfs, option trades require a large sample size to make higher returns, picking and choosing leads to more losses, even across back tested strategies, due to the sample size.
1390 2019-03-09 23:47:22 just fought someone on quickplay that had stamina with 3 stocks, and they sd'ed twice after I took one stock lmfao

All this recent winning is wonderful!

1511 2019-03-09 21:16:33 Sure, I've missed out of ONE of my asset classes only, US stocks. But I still was correct in missing out, because the FED has NEVER taken low interest rates and then continuously lowering them for 10  years. I had correct prediction, but didn't turn out the way it should've, wait
1512 2019-03-09 21:14:29 I completely get the long game. Been long pot stocks for 5 years. But I’ve gone through dips that aren’t necessary. Adjust game plan according to market. This time avg $1.15 $cxxi out at $1.85avg. I plan on going long but why not lock profits and reload cheap if possible?
1513 2019-03-09 21:13:34 Stocks plunged as Fluor Corporation unveiled a meddlesome shopping bag today.

1515 2019-03-09 21:11:52 But they do.. they have been buying stocks.. which props up the markets.. when was that there remit ? Propping up the markets props the pound.
1516 2019-03-09 21:10:31 Typical angry liberal name calling because they have no intelligent arguments....Btw I’m middle class and my taxes and stocks look great. How about yours? never mind I’m sure you’re unemployed living in your parent’s basement waiting on your welfare check.
1517 2019-03-09 21:10:19 The Yoshicord vs Pikacord JMU Crew Battle was a crazy one. Good stuff as Yoshicord takes another Victory! I myself took 9 stocks and I feel proud of myself since I was really not confident before it began. GGs!
1518 2019-03-09 21:09:40 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1519 2019-03-09 21:08:21 Nice explanation
1520 2019-03-09 21:05:58 Make sure your penny stocks go full blast by signing up for @BIGMONEYMIKE6 alerts! #pennystock #pennystockcult #pennyland #MONEYGANG #BMM #otc #Alert
1521 2019-03-09 21:05:54 /2 But today, to shift the trust fund to stocks would mean the Treasury repaying it earlier, which imposes a "transition cost" on the budget. Transition costs were (IMO) a big reason why GW Bush's proposal for Social Security personal accounts didn't succeed.
1522 2019-03-09 21:05:18 It’s polite to explain a little when you request. It’s not (as) polite to ask when you receive a request. We put as many as possible of our published fly stocks in @flystocks, plan to make more use of @Addgene, so I don’t even know who has requested them. Just glad to be cited.
1523 2019-03-09 21:04:53 Zero is back ! That 3 stocks ! #smashsummit
1524 2019-03-09 21:03:58 I normally trade undervalued mid cap stocks, but taking a chance here in the smallcap bio space. Not sure what compelled me to buy, but felt this would make a run. Not a bagholder here... yet haha. I would like to see some news along with earnings when it’s released
1525 2019-03-09 21:03:58 If this were the late 1990s, with Social Security surpluses projected & time to build them, I think you'd be right. (I opposed trust fund investment in stocks at the time, but now think I may have been mistaken.) 1/
1526 2019-03-09 21:03:00 "People would prefer not to take any risk, but that is not possible. Even the safest investment involves some risk." #investing #Investing101 #stocks
1527 2019-03-09 21:02:51 @SamsClub Unhappy that the Catonsville, Baltimore location or any location close to me no longer stocks Purina Cat Chow. Going to have to review whether the membership is worth it as Sams raises prices & cuts back on products.
1528 2019-03-09 21:02:46 Really? I'm yet to see an actual client scenario where VCTs have washed their face. I've asked every VCT salesman I've met to show me one, and I'm still waiting.
1529 2019-03-09 21:01:03 Dude you're so much better with greninja than you were it's crazy. Edgeguarding was sick, but you need to work on getting stocks off, you were fishing for them and Zackray got a lot outta that
1530 2019-03-09 20:57:48 It follows when folks never tire of reminding us that housing is not a good wealth vehicle but stocks and equities are. Being able to purchase those are entirely an income effect.
1531 2019-03-09 20:57:41 Rate cuts are bearish for the markets. Mostly because money outflows from stocks to bonds as they are 100x more attractive when FED cuts. FED is always late. They cut rates way too late. Inertia od the economy just steamrolls them.
1532 2019-03-09 20:57:25 Heller is a little more recent but hey, why let facts get in the way? You support banning black rifles with adjustable stocks, pistol grips & detachable mags. Not because they are more dangerous than any other semi-auto rifle but because they resemble military rifles. Truth!
1533 2019-03-09 20:56:05 Oh sure, I had insider information on the stocks I traded and then Iied my ass off to #SEC investigators but I'm back on air selling #lifestyle tips because I've led an exemplary and #OtherwiseBlamelessLife
1534 2019-03-09 20:55:54 @TSM_Leffen was spitting facts during the crew battle. If nairo or void took 3 stocks in a melee crew battle vs mang0 or leffen reddit and twitter would be livid. But with mango just taking 2 off void and losing everyone is under reacting. Leffen's knowledge is top tier
1535 2019-03-09 20:54:58 I thought about investing in some stocks but, when I see them losing money I know it’s gonna piss me off cuz I barely like spending it
1536 2019-03-09 20:54:09 I think I buy every single bottle of white zin that the gas station by my house stocks 
1537 2019-03-09 20:53:03 Is it a myth that the NRA said or did nothing to criticize Trump for his ban and confiscation of bump stocks from 400,000 responsible law abiding citizens who had done absolutely nothing wrong?
1538 2019-03-09 20:50:57 Stocks going up! 
1539 2019-03-09 20:50:42 *2 stocks
1540 2019-03-09 20:50:31 Giving up when down 3 stocks
1541 2019-03-09 20:47:56 so uhhhh update: second match, 1st round out of best of 3, and opponent SD's after 2 stocks saying "i'll take my loser's bracket like a man, playing against (my main) makes me wanna fuckin kill myself"
not sure how to feel
1542 2019-03-09 20:47:45 $SPY $SPX #stocks #trading - Tons of companies have “great DD” but guess what; a ton of them don’t ever follow through. People tend to forget a company can have phenomenal prospects but need THE EXECUTION to back it up!
1543 2019-03-09 20:47:37 But Tony has a degree in Finance so I assume he has some knowledge about money, business and stocks I suppose.
1544 2019-03-09 20:47:35 Publicly traded means nothing to me, you could be penny stocks. What market you are listed on would mean more to me?
Now you mad  because you refused to accept the factual information provided or couldn't grasp it.
1545 2019-03-09 20:46:05 Cosmo seemed to be way more ground oriented than Armada. Maybe you were to comfortable with air oriented gameplay style like armada? Also 2-3 potential stocks were just off by a few frames when you used dair on the ledge. Could've been worse honestly
1546 2019-03-09 20:43:44 apple stocks rise by 20%.
1547 2019-03-09 20:42:20 There's an Ocado in Park Royal that stocks Green Cola - failing that, you can also purchase it on Amazon. Hope this helps!
1548 2019-03-09 20:42:00 Remember when fraulein Romney talked about how emotionally difficult it was for her husband to sell some of the stocks daddy gave him to pay their expenses while he was in school?
1549 2019-03-09 20:41:57 Really because the stocks of the Steel and Aluminum companies are ignoring the great news!
1550 2019-03-09 20:41:21 i honestly think the 1 stocks game 3 are more because of the winner's taking it a bit easier/relaxing a little/trying out stuff, more than the loser's adapting nwn;

it didn't really look like they were doing any better
1551 2019-03-09 20:40:40 Nooo Daz Stocks, they have took Stella out. Caravan for sale
1552 2019-03-09 20:40:01 We talkin like 2 full instant noodle ramen packs, a whole carton of Pho broth, steak seasoned with salt/pepper/chili powder, bean stocks, chives, celery, and portobello mushrooms. 
1553 2019-03-09 20:39:53 Parianas Machiparu Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
1554 2019-03-09 20:38:58 When its costume night at bingo but your Chinese meme stocks are plunging
1555 2019-03-09 20:36:44 stocks is stocks
1556 2019-03-09 20:36:04 It's good that you called the piece an "opinion." That's what it is. 

The premise (unemployment, stocks, etc) are not supported by verifiable facts. It repeats popular claims that have been disproved by careful analysis. 

Articles like this show the need for fact-checking.
1557 2019-03-09 20:35:48 Tell her I sell artificial and natural beards...at affordable prices...fena  ebu DM chap chap while stocks last 
1558 2019-03-09 20:35:35 Almost everyone that has a 401k has stocks whether it be individual stocks or Mutual funds that have stocks. Plus it is good for workers when the stock in their company is up
1559 2019-03-09 20:35:19 I don't really get the salt emotes in the chat. It was clearly almost impossible to come back against Cosmos while being 2 stocks and 2 games behind.
1560 2019-03-09 20:34:36 That's typical of him though I dont blame him when he's down in stocks like that
1561 2019-03-09 20:34:02 It shouldn't be a short term business investment model. It should be a long term one, like holding stocks used to be. That is the trouble, too many want to make too much, too quickly. If they dont like it, then dont buy property. Prices fall to a realistic level.
1562 2019-03-09 20:33:40 Was going to reply with this. The new braces are practically indistinguishable from stocks. I have a SBA3 on my AR pistol. They are also starting to make braces for firearms outside of the AR and AK families. The Tailhook brace on my CZ Scorpion looks damn close to the stock
1563 2019-03-09 20:32:06 14 Years of Stocks, Trading, Advertisement and To Date Not Being Awarded Any Monies By The State or Intellectual Property and Still Owed To Date I Would Not Award You Any Rights at GoDaddyLLC No Matter Who You are On My Systems Operations Experience Based on Debt and Competence

1566 2019-03-09 20:30:04 1/.Still sY those involved with ensuring stocks would continue whatever the Brexit situation would bring ie medical supplies? Those items with a long term shelf-life could have been ordered long before this month, on existing equipment ordering schedules,before the suppliers ...>
1567 2019-03-09 20:29:26 Tic do hold long term stocks or other investments?  If you do how do you decide when to buy and sell?
1568 2019-03-09 20:27:05 They put kids in cages. Let's put them in the stocks and hand out rotten tomatoes to pelt them with.

And yes, vastly overpriced re-issues on overly heavy vinyl are also a bone of contention.

Im a purist!
1571 2019-03-09 20:24:51 Bass Pro stocks Traeger if that is what you were after. They sold me their display.
1572 2019-03-09 20:22:38 We will keep an eye on the stocks and colours on the website 
1573 2019-03-09 20:22:29 so many of them are millionaires-and not because they earned it, they just know which stocks to pick
1574 2019-03-09 20:21:27 No, that is not my field. Sorry. I just trade stocks.
1575 2019-03-09 20:20:50 Which financial assets are you investing in right now? Wether it’s stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc. Choose the one that works best for you! #3500EDGEMonica
1576 2019-03-09 20:20:21 I'LL BUY ALL YOUR STOCKS
1577 2019-03-09 20:20:16 A1: a: Risking is taking a chance on whether a product will increase or decrease in value.  For example, when investing in stocks, you may purchase stocks on a company and if the stock increases, then the money in which you invested goes up as well.
1578 2019-03-09 20:19:38 think u will be fine. Friday seemed to be a share shakeout, will sort itself out Mon/Tues. I am new to aim and found surprisingly shares go down before they go up lol. oil and gas fluctuate wildly. Reduce your risk and maybe find stocks which are not so volatile til you are comfy
1579 2019-03-09 20:19:35 Spurs broke my heart. The stocks weren’t in my favor
1580 2019-03-09 20:17:00 The store hope to have a better stocked fruit aisle in the very near future. With regards to the lack of water there was a failed delivery, however this has now arrived and stocks will be replenished tonight. Thanks - Anil 2/2

1583 2019-03-09 20:10:32 Non-coercive #Socialism is achievable w/in #Capitalism. Just start companies that entitle all emp's to equal stocks. If it's so good, it will catch on. Unless... what ppl support isn't "real" Soc, but massive govt central planning which destroyed "not really Socialist" Venezuela.

1587 2019-03-09 20:07:05 Think of how much bigger this boom would have been to give the taxscam money to the 99%: It would have come back to the 1% eventually anyway, but would have helped everybody MUCH more and wouldn’t end up mostly buying back Stocks by Corps.

1589 2019-03-09 20:06:35 Sick of #IWD2019 advertisements  asking women to invest in MFs or stocks to secure their futures.

Well a lot of women did save money and then their money got demonetised.

Investing in stocks and MFs assumes financial literacy and access to financial advice. 

We need better.

1591 2019-03-09 20:01:57 The severance paid the the former Hydro One CEO was primarily the value of stocks acquired as part of his pay package under the Liberals if I'm not mistaken. The Hydro One/Avista merger, signed by Wynne, was cancelled due to rulings by to U.S. regulatory bodies, not by Ford.

1603 2019-03-09 19:45:07 (1/2) The model I like to sort of simplify the notion of what goes o­n in a market for common stocks is the pari-mutuel system at the racetrack... a pari-mutuel system is a market. Everybody goes there and bets and the odds change based o­n what's bet.
1604 2019-03-09 19:45:07 Pit 4 stocks rob 3 stocks

1606 2019-03-09 19:41:57 Rekt if true ofc. but FA on $enj is pretty awsome nok the less. But can’t justify this recently boom in prices. But Samsung partnership would justify it. Nobody can reveal this partnership now anyways if true (laws regarding shares/stocks etc.). It’s too early. Will see if true.

1612 2019-03-09 19:35:47 I agree, but I wonder if complete change in energy systems is even an understatement: Moving from energy stocks to energy incomes has many other implications - maybe energy should be more expensive, maybe it is not always available.

1622 2019-03-09 19:29:05 Yes, definitely if you already invested in this... It can even go higher than Rs 12 or may be till Rs 17-18/- but you should always stay away from such stocks... These stocks can harm you in long run with negligible returns..  Even PPF is better than this!

1625 2019-03-09 19:26:29 bitmex prepared me for stocks in a cpl ways but mainly cause in both markets the real action usually happens when you can’t do anything about it ie nights/weekends are just longer system overloads (with more Arthur’s)
1626 2019-03-09 19:26:16 Entrepreneur and Investor, This is not a recommendation to buy or sell on some stocks. How can I make your day better ?

1639 2019-03-09 19:13:25 @ChuckGrassley The wash rule is stupid & for someone trying to sell stocks at an average price to avoid a loss, that's actually causing a loss, that would otherwise not be a deduction.

1646 2019-03-09 19:07:23 Can I invest more than just hype into @discordapp? Like stocks? :D
1647 2019-03-09 19:06:17 Years ago I got curious about why stocks breakout on huge volume. So I came up with these charts that I bring you all today. Thank you for all the follows and likes, and most importantly let's all continue to profit consistently! $STUDY
1648 2019-03-09 19:05:42 Hello I’m looking to purchase stock in your corporation.  What’s that, you are flush with manipulated service time Major League Baseball candidates? That’s just the kind of asset I’m interested in. I’m sold, 2 stocks please.
1649 2019-03-09 19:04:39 I think she responded to a similar question from another follower. Will try to validate this over the few stocks I follow and revert with findings. PS - am agnostic about technical trading.
1650 2019-03-09 19:04:31 Extrapolate far and wide enough and you’ll have 3 stocks left in your ESG fund. Maybe 4.

We have voted our conscience, we have voted for @Kwara_APC , we know fixing a rotten Kwara isn't an easy task, please do your best so we don't become  laughing stocks. @ogundamisi @ProfOsinbajo @MBuhari. Better Kwara is achievable.

1655 2019-03-09 19:01:23 $SPY On a morning sell off like we had on Friday, I'm not just hoping to see if markets go higher to believe they're likely to do so over the next few days and/or to 2nd guess as to weather we're now in a bear or bull market. We got positioned in several stocks. See what we get.
1656 2019-03-09 19:00:52 Of course you should always have a drink when you are in the stocks, makes the time go by faster.
1657 2019-03-09 19:00:00 Interesting thought. I may own some stocks through mutual funds. Since I don’t know what they are they can really influence my drug selection.
1658 2019-03-09 18:59:18 Might dump and purchase 2021 warrants though...
1659 2019-03-09 18:58:35 And u have those shoes. Only thing u DONT is bootcut jeans cos u like to show ur package in “super skinny’s”
1660 2019-03-09 18:58:14 how about the jobs and stocks reports? are you trying to deflect with your border propaganda?
1661 2019-03-09 18:58:11 Agreed. Third party morality labels like “sin stocks” haven’t been an important part of modern ESG discussions for many years. But I know that concept still circulates in uninformed circles and is a great straw man.
1662 2019-03-09 18:56:48 I've always wondered why financial networks and politicians jawbone the stock market when the bond market is so much larger. Is it because retail is more involved in stocks and therefore it's easier to manipulate sentiment?
1663 2019-03-09 18:56:18 Stocks. They are divine!
1664 2019-03-09 18:55:34 I bought u same jacket for ur birthday x

1668 2019-03-09 18:53:07 Amzn has certainly lagged along w rest of large cap tech while the best stocks have been the crap trade ytd
1669 2019-03-09 18:52:54 There is no sense to sell this stock after 140 level it can jump 165-180 in 5trading session only..if stocks can reach 140 to 96 in 2trades?
1670 2019-03-09 18:52:43 so no onw knows how to buy stocks
1671 2019-03-09 18:52:33 @federalreserve is being pounded for a flip flop by nearly everyone including those on @cnbc who used to masterbste to fed speak. They're also asking the fed if they are only interested in saving stocks? Dats YTD is spooking them. The 3 stooges did this once before to calm mrkts
1672 2019-03-09 18:52:11 TK took 8 stocks in crews lol #UltimateSummit
1673 2019-03-09 18:52:01 Only invest what you an afford to loose, that's the risk in investing in stocks, which is why I only invest what we can afford to lose in full.#Business #Quotes - David Law
1674 2019-03-09 18:51:54 Nah not my point at all- but suggesting that wmt or tgt are better stocks for a short term outperformance is off base - am merely suggesting that the longer term view say the last 5 yrs or next 5 will be the real test
1675 2019-03-09 18:51:49 Personally, over long periods, I’ll take a group of “sin” stocks that nobody should own over a group of “ethical” stocks that everyone should own all day long.  What humans say and what they actually do/spend with their time/money are very different things.
1676 2019-03-09 18:51:25 and believe me, $OSTK needs cash to survive - Byrne hasnt moved yet because he tried for so long to raise money - but once he realizes that his raising failed, he has a special incentive to dump before the stocks falls down (the higher the stock, the more money grabbed per share)
1677 2019-03-09 18:51:05 Ah, well CZ black vinyl can have issues too as we both know. I don't know who Warner use but I've had both clear (actually milky tinted) and black that were good. 180g is such a misnomer though. Perhaps they could escape non fill issues if they went lighter mass.
1678 2019-03-09 18:50:04 Tang ina dami poblema ng shooooop. Delay delay pa stocks. Pakyu Distri ng Manila. 
1679 2019-03-09 18:49:16 this year is 3 months, YOY is 12 months. If you're suggesting that TGT, COST, NKE etc are the "worst most shorted stocks" I'd stick to indexing.
1680 2019-03-09 18:47:50 How come banking institutions discriminate by forcing people to put money in a roth & stocks to earn a higher amount of Interest vs a savings account?  Yet when they trash the stock on TV, it goes down? @SenWarren @USArmy @Google
1681 2019-03-09 18:47:44 $OSTK has a standing shelf offering - legal word meaning that Byrnes has already secured the authorization to dump LOTs of stocks on longs at any time, no public notification in advance, nothing - you can’t time that, by the time you learn the crash, it’s too late 
1682 2019-03-09 18:47:23 Understanding of course that the worst most shorted stocks are massively outperforming so far this yr
1683 2019-03-09 18:46:32 Since 09 this mrkt is a fed induced buying orgasim from CB juice and buybacks. No time in history has WS rewarded stocks in a fed put/QE. This cycle has <1/2 the GDP of last cycle for the 3x the debt. 2019 will show if it's real or bullshit.
1684 2019-03-09 18:46:21 As @tbfairchild noted, most of the off the shelf data is very weak. Are alcohol stocks “sin” stocks? Why? Humans have long used alcohol as an important part of our culture. There is little evidence these companies hurt society. But labeled sin due to 3rd party moralistic labels.
1685 2019-03-09 18:44:12 No! The stocks, please!
1686 2019-03-09 18:43:29 I’m about to get some baby phat, apple bottom stocks fytb
1687 2019-03-09 18:41:45 The $SPX Components Put/Call Ratio (options on the stocks themselves, not the index) hit 0.94 in each of the past 3 trading sessions.

The last time that happened was Dec 20-24, 2018.

But...did we bounce Dec 26 *because* of that or *in spite* of that?

[data @TDAmeritrade]
1688 2019-03-09 18:41:39 Even though some municipal authorities had stocks of stable iodine, they were not distributed.
1689 2019-03-09 18:41:07 Demand will be the kicker. Usda had demand flat at 0.4% growth for 3 years, then surged 4% in 2016 (30 mmts growth)

Now, demand flat for 3rd year at 0.2% growth. What will this coming year be? If it grows just 2%, stocks/use will be too tight.
1690 2019-03-09 18:40:07 I lowkey hate trying to kill people as wii fit and that's by far where my lamest play comes in cause I have like no safe ways to close stocks below 160 if you don't play like an idiot so I just keep running
1691 2019-03-09 18:39:48 I’m sure you’ve discovered by now that these are Stocks (Matthiola). They usually have a lovely scent especially when growing rather than cut. Wonderful spectrum of colours too.
1692 2019-03-09 18:39:45 I too try and stay tf out of stocks that go bk...think of all the waste. I am now esg as well.
1693 2019-03-09 18:37:39 “Well that’s fine if you own stocks”....she’s not that dumb, she just knows her audience
1694 2019-03-09 18:37:22 I love stocks! One of my favourites.
1695 2019-03-09 18:37:10 While you lot are deramping, I think I'll load up on some quality stocks.
1696 2019-03-09 18:36:03 Contraction leading to expansion at key levels.  Tough to catch unless scanning favorite stocks intraday on multiple timeframes.  I only caught because I was home Friday.  
1697 2019-03-09 18:34:27 Long term returns aren’t weeds. It’s one of the best returning stocks of all time and they just bought Juul. Stick to coal stocks.
1698 2019-03-09 18:33:10 I've always said that the best base pair would be a currency based off the value of a basket of assets of all different forms like commodities, currencies, top stocks, precious metals, and even bitcoin. Use oracles to constantly feed it data to keep it updated.
1699 2019-03-09 18:32:06 if it breaks support you thinking stocks fall hard again?
1700 2019-03-09 18:31:25 There's a belief some index fund ownership is Chinese origin. The paper position could be stocks ownership of wheat/corn. Seems odd to me I-funds started liquidating longs in Dec. Sell the paper position, prepare to buy the physical. We are talking 1/6 global pop here.
1701 2019-03-09 18:31:17 Countries are like corporations . They exist in perpetuity. If my corporation was found guilty of a crime committed before I owned its stocks, I am still liable as a shareholder to make restitution. Some of U.S national debt goes back to 1950s, probably (1/2)
1702 2019-03-09 18:30:41 Has that been true historically? Almost all unbiased research I’ve seen shows sin stocks have historically outperformed.
1703 2019-03-09 18:30:06 It all depends on your investment horizon. Don’t get me wrong; I don’t think Social Security should be privatized. But don’t ignore the fact that over a lifetime, an investment in stocks would give you greater returns than social security (assuming you put away money yearly).
1704 2019-03-09 18:28:06 My question has what has he done to make it happen. Name one economic indicator that wasn't already going in the right direction. Unemployment was brought down 1 to 1.3% since he took office. previous. admin  went down 5%. Stocks went from 8 to 18k previous. Up 7k  down last yr.
1705 2019-03-09 18:27:08 Cont. So implicitly,  while I don’t know the size of your positions in the3, you’re shorting the non GOOG /AMZN components of QQQ. Seems like a hard way to generate returns. Probably easier to close you eyes & buy cloud stocks. Well I guess everyone  has their own gig. Good luck!
1706 2019-03-09 18:26:29 Next Saturday at Brownstown Speedway the open wheel modified feature will pay $1,000 to win...plus the Lucas Oil Late Models $12,000 to win and also running the pure stocks

1708 2019-03-09 18:23:00 No, they're not. The 12 years of Reagan/Bush quadrupled our national debt. It's not hard to forget the huge recession under George W. Bush. Tax cuts are not spent on employees but instead on buying back stocks or upgrading facilities. Workers are still paid far less than fair.
1709 2019-03-09 18:21:59 People always say what your saying, as stocks skyrocket, and make excuses why it should not be happening too 
1710 2019-03-09 18:21:18 Biggest regrets at an older age!

. Not starting a business
. Not having an healthy body
. Not saving for retirement
. Not investing in stocks, real estate
. Not spending time on myself and family
. Not expressing your feelings

What do you regret the most? 
1711 2019-03-09 18:20:34 This is criminal! I say we bring back stocks and put Maxine in the center of all this filth!
1712 2019-03-09 18:19:56 At that point, I was totally carefree. Capital for me meant a monthly amount SIPed into my trading account. It was disaster. Hence, the cash I had from selling stocks, plus monthly surplus from my salary, went in buying puts. I had virtually blown up my trading/Investing capital
1713 2019-03-09 18:19:36 Perhaps, but valuations are washed out, sentiment is hated and stocks are considered to be uninvestable. Historically, that's a pretty good setup. Arguing that cyclicals are no longer cyclicals is a dangerous version of 'this time is different.'
1714 2019-03-09 18:18:50 That's all messed up. We are interning an era of cleansing of the poor, sick, otherwise imperfect people. You dont hear or see any issues with the rich until the the stocks fall. Then they fall. Out the 20th floor window.
1715 2019-03-09 18:17:40 I really think that metals such as GLD and SLV are in an accumulation zone right now, much as BTC. If you look at the charts they pump during recessions and are inverse to stocks. I am going to start scaling in while they are low.

1719 2019-03-09 18:15:36 Personal experience is much higher percentage of issues with coloured and variant pressings. Possibly because so many are done via the artisanal Czech bunch.

1726 2019-03-09 18:10:48 I'm not smart enough to find out myself, but is there any way that Trump's Chinese sanctions policy could benefit certain well connected Chinese citizens? By shorting Chinese steel stocks, or something like that?

1738 2019-03-09 18:03:48 @Shehzad_Ind it's very clear see when UPA1 came 24 carat gold rate was 460 per gram, in 2013 it was around 3000 per gram. We all know diamond n good dealers usually stock old stocks n make profit, imagine how much Nirav has made. N aftr 4yrs even good rate s 3200

1748 2019-03-09 17:59:22 The stocks on a Saturday, an the lash on a Sunday.
1749 2019-03-09 17:57:57 The Stock Market does not represent the Economy.  I venture to say that more than half the people in this country do not own stocks.
1750 2019-03-09 17:56:34 Yikes... The stock market isn't just a measurement of how much stockholders are making... stocks go up when the businesses that distribute that stock are doing well...
1751 2019-03-09 17:55:58 @BMTheEquityDesk  means it is one of the confirmation that ur selected stock is doing good in bear phase also.BTW Does these names sounds familiar ?Sintex Industries,KRBL,PSU banks ,Balrampur Chini 
They r Ur recommend stocks in the past,which is 50% down from ur recommeded price
1752 2019-03-09 17:55:56 I believe they do see the irony, I believe they are all well aware of the hypocrisy but they just don’t care.  As someone said, it’s all about the benjamins until 401Ks and stocks crash.  Then suddenly they will sing a different hymn
1753 2019-03-09 17:55:44 You may look at the charts of jul-dec 2007. Stocks just exploded. Daily movements of 10-15 per cent upmoves were common. Indices were going sharply up. Many stocks went up 3-5 x just in those 6 months. So the puts, which would gone up in value if markets fell, actually lost value
1754 2019-03-09 17:54:33 My college kid said she heard stocks had a bad week.  She asked me how her small Roth IRA did. 

“You had a great week. It was up about 2.5%.”

“How much is that?”

“About $65.”

“Oh.....I thought you said it did great.”
1755 2019-03-09 17:54:05 Also not sure how it compares to an a**hole hoping that the Fed keeps printing money so that stocks keep going up.
1756 2019-03-09 17:53:44 I never expected U stocks would rip right after 232. It’s just clarification for building a roadmap forward.

1759 2019-03-09 17:52:33 Don't pick stocks. Literally every study shows that's impossible. Practice proper asset allocation, and avoid making emotional decisions to get in/out or chase FOMO. You'll be just fine. Unfortunately, few people can do that either.

1764 2019-03-09 17:50:26 So , there are many retirees and others that depend on stock market and the economy.
How does this "breaking" up companies actually work with the stocks?

Or are we going to get rid of stock market? Is that the plan?
1765 2019-03-09 17:49:23 When I was poor I always said, "One day I'll buy organic produce." I'm no longer poor, and it's worse. I now live 40 minutes away from a grocery store that stocks produce, and I won't drive there. So I'm trying to learn how to grow lettuce, carrots, and berries. Buddha help me.
1766 2019-03-09 17:48:52 Between Will Self and Gollum, I'm definitively shorting on raw fish stocks.
1767 2019-03-09 17:48:20 I'm also reading that the ATF 1st ruled that they were fine, and then were pressured into looking into it again since the bump stocks more or less accomplish the same goal of rapid fire, or at least a much faster rate of fire than without one, that the rule was meant to curb.
1768 2019-03-09 17:47:54 How many blue chip stocks are liquid. You rarely see a million units of Dangote Cement trading. Or a nestle. It will take days to get such an order. The bank's maybe.

1770 2019-03-09 17:45:53 You do realize stocks are a risk investment at any point if he was really tryna spit game he would’ve mentioned a 401k Roth ra or a CD account and yes when you the first one in the family with money and everyone need help you need that money NOW

1776 2019-03-09 17:42:26 You are a value guy. Your portfolio is down 30%. You assess the situation and everything is intact, you love it and buy more of your stocks. Now they're down 20% more. Still favourable gap b/w price vs. value and everything intact. Underperformed market.
What do you do?

1786 2019-03-09 17:34:33 The ATF gives opinions and enforces the law... they don’t make laws, Congress does. Constitutionally the ATF can’t ban Bump Stocks, only Congress can. This lawsuit is against the ATF.

1806 2019-03-09 17:18:49 When interests go down, stocks go up, it's pretty well known. Investors get more bang for each loaned dollar.

But GNP's growth could capture that partially.

The 5% base interest rate in 2000 likely affected the pic, vs. below 1 now.

1808 2019-03-09 17:13:32 It’s partially competitive because of the need to maintain stake weight due to the potential reduction from inflation, and partially from staker turnover similar to regular shareholder turnover in traditional stocks and routine competition to achieve controlling interest.

1816 2019-03-09 17:05:01 I (unfortunately) know a Wirehouse Broker that picks stocks/bonds and receives "production credits" by charging trading commissions (~$150-$300/transaction) and from margin loan interest. All in, 85 y/o client with $750,000 pays ~$30k in commissions/fees per year. Unreal!
1817 2019-03-09 17:03:09 I think about the valuations of tobacco stocks.  They are one of the most common divestments and often cheaper than the rest of the market.  But even if effect is zero some investors don’t want to profit from companies that are disagreeable to their values

1837 2019-03-09 16:46:12 That implies that higher valuation is somehow justified with lower rates but I disagree: if interest rates AND growth rates both are low, no valuation premium on stocks should be justified by the low interest rates. That is exactly what the Buffett indicator tries to encapsulate.

1854 2019-03-09 16:32:17 All data since the pivot explains why the flip flop but the @federalreserve lies about why matters & is disturbing. This data was evident before the flop flop but most ignored it. Saving stocks is Feds main mandate. Yellen once said if stocks go it all goes. Fed believes this.
1855 2019-03-09 16:31:15 I mean, all things considered, if you gave people the option of putting Will Self and Gary Lineker in the stocks and pelting them with trash in exchange for stopping Brexit, how many would be up for it?

1: Yes we can. You dont sign a guy to a 5 year contract and then trade him. You do not do it. They can build an O-line and keep Odell

2: The raiders and cardinals are much bigger laughing stocks than the giants

1901 2019-03-09 15:59:28 3-1966 was the start of a 15-year period in which stocks barely advanced at all. If you were in the market back then, you were rewarded eventually, but only if you were extremely patient.
1902 2019-03-09 15:58:15 Then don't play them. Simple AF......
1903 2019-03-09 15:57:56 For team HK, please PM @Jhenny93506025 because may friend siya na pupunta dyan sa March 15 daw and I will meet up with the friend on the 14th sa bandang Alabang. Hehe. Sorry unti lang talaga stocks. Sana mareplenish soon. 
1904 2019-03-09 15:56:38 My mom gives up ice cream and then stocks the freezer with her favorites so that the temptation is real.
1905 2019-03-09 15:56:22 If everyone voted Democrat and we turn socialists - stocks won’t be worth the paper they are printed on and we will all go broke.  Maybe that’s what she wants!  Only the politicians will have all they money.
1906 2019-03-09 15:56:03 U.S. #stocks finished lower every day of the week as global economic data kept disappointing, capped off by weak U.S. jobs report. For the week, the Dow and the S&P 500 both fell 2.2% and the Nasdaq declined 2.5%.
1907 2019-03-09 15:54:53 Hi Rich, these were given to customers as they entered the screen though they were only available while stocks lasted we're afraid.
1908 2019-03-09 15:52:44 Because I believe that I can soundly beat ETF returns. I have different weightings in my stocks and ETFs buy stocks (just because they have large market caps) that I don't want to own.

1911 2019-03-09 15:46:14 Let me tell you how Trump's policies helped to make this happen
1. This car is a green fuel reduction emission car - green has been vilified and emission standards gutted
2. GM used Trump tax cuts to buy back stocks to inflate stock price for share holders - made massive profit

1916 2019-03-09 15:39:20 I know it. But most people lose sight of the real easy money trading. Premiums go down so fast on say FANG stocks that a fifty cent move in a FANG stock  can cost a dollar of premium on the option.

1918 2019-03-09 15:37:52 ? The market was negative last year.  The long bull market starting in 09 officially ended a few months ago.  Reality: most stocks/sectors/indices peaked in Feb 2018.

1934 2019-03-09 15:25:29 And I thought the ASX in Australia had a bad website until I stated looked at Canadian and US stocks. The government websites for filling are terrible from a UX point of view. Then the filings themselves need an overhaul in how filing information is presented to investors.

1943 2019-03-09 15:20:49 Norway&#039;s trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund plans to dump 134 oil and gas stocks from its benchmark index, the finance ministry announced on Friday.
1944 2019-03-09 15:20:49 Stocks fell after the U.S. government released jobs data that badly missed expectations, adding to fears of slower economic growth.
1945 2019-03-09 15:20:34 Not a bad RE investment strategy 

This is kind of like what investment banks do with media to manipulate stocks.
1946 2019-03-09 15:18:49 Bump stocks have been made illegal

1956 2019-03-09 15:11:27 Pension funds are by far the biggest investor group in equity, followed thereafter by university endowments. Many people have exposure to the stock market (whether they realize it or not).

The idea that only the rich own stocks is about as antiquated as most “progressive ideas”.
1957 2019-03-09 15:10:29 Less stocks ?
1958 2019-03-09 15:09:43 Until the bonds turn south and begin to offset the dividend and start acting like stocks, which since about 2000 seems much more common than when the bonds lower risk idea started.  Low interest=greater risk, than in the past.  Or maybe, it’s just me

1966 2019-03-09 15:05:32 After seeing my portfolio crushed from Oct->Christmas Eve, and asking why, I began to discover answers that, to me, proved stocks weren’t being unfairly sold. They were simply resetting to fair value. After that, it’s hard to see price pumping as anything but fraud.
1967 2019-03-09 15:05:17 full disclosure: i don’t own any stocks in either company :)
1968 2019-03-09 15:03:35 During the gold rush, the ones who really got rich were the ones selling the picks and axes. That is, the companies which provided the tools for the speculators to go out and try to find their fortunes. Think about this when you choose stocks as well.

1976 2019-03-09 14:58:41 That is a very reasonable assumption. Aquaculture is obviously taking pressure off the wild stocks. Going forward we need both a sustainable wild fishery and a thriving aquaculture industry in order to feed our exploding human population #sustainability

1979 2019-03-09 14:56:57 There’s been a global decline in fish stocks because of overfishing. Commercial farming “fish farming” has been adopted to mitigate the lack of supply. Most salmon, prawns, trout and sea bass are farmed. It’s also easier to control their feed (soy and corn proteins)...

1990 2019-03-09 14:50:08 You know why indexing is so popular? Because most people belong there. Because if they work really hard do the homework, pick the stocks, they’re still just average.  And have wasted a precious commodity—TIME
1991 2019-03-09 14:50:03 Others can bid ???  There are no others at this level in Canada.  Let alone the fact a criminal investigstion would cause the stocks to drop to levels that would make them vulnerable to foreign takeover.  All not good.
1992 2019-03-09 14:49:39 It’s an accommodation at best. I’ve only had one client request it and said client terminated the mandate with prejudice after discovering DTE Energy on a confirm. “I told you no oil stocks” (electric utility and NG sales).
1993 2019-03-09 14:49:15 In 2009 those ten stocks were expensive on nearly every historically reliable metric so most value investors avoided them then and still avoid them today.

2004 2019-03-09 14:41:27 Yes .but stock is in bearish mode . Buying weak stock at previous horizontal support may not be good option. Such pattern works best for stocks in bullish trend

2014 2019-03-09 14:34:42 Actually, stocks have done really well since 2009 - you might have made a lot of money. The problem is that 401k accounts have horrendously high fees that eat away at returns. And people dont save enough for retirement.
2015 2019-03-09 14:34:20 Interesting article, but it's not about ESG, it's about SRI. ESG involves consideration of what kind of impact ESG risks may have on the share price of a company. This is something all investors should be mindful of. SRI involves excluding stocks based on one's values.

2028 2019-03-09 14:25:23 Interesting stats from Merryn Somerset Webb in today's FT:- "In the UK, £1 invested in 1955 in value stocks, defined as the 40 per cent with the lowest book-to-market ratio, would now be worth more than 20 times the amount generated by £1 placed in growth stocks."

2030 2019-03-09 14:23:21 Stocks Went Up $17.58 
2031 2019-03-09 14:23:21 True but simple marketing actually works best.  Fundsmith proves this I think.  Our instincts don't work when it comes to investing: buy cheap stuff then sell when it goes up.  Investing isn't flipping houses.  Stocks that can compound do best IMO.
2032 2019-03-09 14:23:00 Those baby organs can make them tens of thousands of dollars. It's better than buying any stocks or BTC. Those sick people need their lambos #ThesePeopleAreSick
2033 2019-03-09 14:22:21 At what point will Wall Street take Democratic Socialists seriously? Not yet, obviously.  When they do stocks like @UHC, @Google, @Facebook and @Amazon will tumble.  If we actually get #MedcareForAll it's curtains for United Health. The downside for them is oblivion.
2034 2019-03-09 14:21:49 Yes, I get they're buying gold. Yet the article suggests that by doing with the addition to stocks will boost inflation and growth.
2035 2019-03-09 14:21:08 Norway is starting the world's biggest divestment in oil and gas - Norway has said its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s biggest, should sell stocks in oil and gas exploration companies, in a move that is the biggest divestment from hydrocarbons yet.

2037 2019-03-09 14:18:57 Everyone in the USA has access to the stock market. No excuses for not owning stocks. Because I wasn’t smart enough to get the education my parents told me I needed to get I’ve been working 60 hrs a week for years to have extra. If that is 1, 2 or even 3 jobs to get it done.
2038 2019-03-09 14:17:56 It's actually over 11 trillion strong. but how much is trading daily. $10 million on an exceedingly good day. I'm saying $20 million would put many stocks on full bid for several days.

2051 2019-03-09 14:05:49 Since then we also had the govt shutdown end, we started to get better and better trade deal headlines, US stocks trended higher and higher and then Q4 GDP was better than expected. Capital flight to USD. Also, US now HY currency vs being a funding currency in past.
2052 2019-03-09 14:05:12 Stock market is up, because the top .01% got their huge tax cuts and bought back their own stocks.

2056 2019-03-09 14:01:33 En als de FED met 1 hike het al voor elkaar krijgt dat mensen hun stocks verkopen (zie eind vorig jaar), wat zegt dat dan over die economie?

2058 2019-03-09 14:00:22 De enige reden dat die stockmarkets het zo goed doen is eindeloos QE. 

Banken willen geld laten werken, en aangezien rentes op nagenoeg 0 zijn, kopen ze maar stocks want 'dat kan toch alleen maar omhoog gaan'. 

De enige reden dat stockmarkets nu opkrabbelen is de FED.

2062 2019-03-09 13:58:12 I at least figured out that I needed to file my nonresident state taxes first, and that got me out of the hole, so I'm still getting a refund. I think it's my HSA and the loss on my stocks that saved me.

2078 2019-03-09 13:37:12 In theory, no, but the stopping and reheating of presses to switch the colours leads to pressing faults. Split colour / splatter always noisier. Also, colour normally at expense of proper inner sleeves. 
Also, colour increasingly seems to mean an extra £3 for no reason.

2086 2019-03-09 13:29:23 EU didn't 'kill' the fishing industry. If the EU hadn't set quotas it is arguable that the British fishermen would have been unable to work together to save fish stocks and thus there would have been no industry.

2146 2019-03-09 12:28:45 I find that a lot of people quoting Buffett doesn't really follow Buffett. Or at least what I understand he meant.

But yea, way too many put him on a pedestal and try to mimick him, following his stocks without really knowing why. The why, as Munger explain, is pretty simple.
2147 2019-03-09 12:25:32 $100M , the few ways to grow that amount of Money are Real Estate, Bonds or Stocks; Of the three stocks yield by far the best returns in the long run. Want to learn that.

2180 2019-03-09 11:57:14 I kinda feel like crypto market cap is 5-7x undervalued based on current use cases.  I can see junk stocks on Nasdaq/Dow offering way less and yet a bigger price tag.

Still feels like we need a bit of a dip to rid stump things.  Set loose stop losses  and hope for the best.

2185 2019-03-09 11:47:06 Dsmash destroys low level play more than wobbling, my favorite mixup used to be dsmash->pivot dsmash->pause->dsmash.

That's the easiest way to get stocks as ICs at low level, spamming cstick is way easier than wobbling and way more detrimental to their development as a player.

2274 2019-03-09 09:39:34 Investors need returns, fund managers need investments to make returns, returns come from performing stocks, which are far & few between. One bad move & career wiped clean.
With great risk come great returns & for great returns, need to take great risk.
It's a vicious circle.

2282 2019-03-09 09:27:49 Narrow pivot width gives relatively wider population of stocks and hence it might be difficult to monitor.  One best alternative is to go for narrow pivot width which falls within the previous day's pivot zone.  This relatively narrows down the list and is also quite powerful.

2285 2019-03-09 09:19:02 On average between $3/$5 million worth of stocks is traded daily. So the NSE is still quite small. So if you came with a mere $20 million, you could send easily shut down the market. Place everything on full bid for a couple of days.

2303 2019-03-09 09:02:16 I wouldn’t say ‘complete’. Still work to be done when ConocoPhillps, Shell etc remain in portfolio. Quite impossible to understand why some of the remaining oil stocks were left there... #climaterisk
2304 2019-03-09 09:00:39 We’ve lost several local libraries round here; I tried to find out what happened to the book stocks at the time they were shut down but no one seemed to know/wanted to tell. I suspect they were ‘recycled’ 
2305 2019-03-09 09:00:15 First, the UK fishing industry is already in trouble bc *apparently*, they don’t understand the need to protect stocks & just hate CFP quotas. 2nd, if you think you can lock EU fishermen out of British waters & still sell British fish in their countries, you’re deluded.
2306 2019-03-09 08:54:43 yep, thats like saying old people are investing in stocks like Amazon etc to "get rich" narrative which is again BS, the whole point of an investment is you want a Return on your Investment and while crypto is more volatile it also has a better ROI since its inception.

2319 2019-03-09 08:41:03 True bad narrative by him to focus on stocks when the economy is actually really good.

2405 2019-03-09 07:11:31 That may be different strategy then. The current strategy I back tested with 4 yrs of data . Win ratio is just 40% but still profitable every quarter since I am trailing always.

2410 2019-03-09 06:58:35 Stock market is not the economy. Buybacks are at records highs and pushed heavily weighted elite stocks higher. Many people have no stocks,401ks or savings. Wages for most folks are stagnant. Taxes are higher. Housing eats most of low/mid class income. Student debt is crippling.
2411 2019-03-09 06:57:12 as long as I make money, fuck everyone else..
2412 2019-03-09 06:51:36 owning stocks will always give you a decent edge over regularly saving money, it will give you a gigantic edge if youre smart about it... 

if life was a competitive game, owning stocks would necessarily become meta in some way. Im surprised most people dont bother in my country.
2413 2019-03-09 06:51:17 It's why i say - might as well put the same effort in picking stocks. The rewards might be also higher!

2420 2019-03-09 06:45:29 The more I scan for new lows, the more I understand how one could make a great living shorting crappy stocks. Never had anything against it per se, but also never really understood why a trader would choose that route. Now I feel like I understand that mindset much more.

2435 2019-03-09 06:26:45 Good growth stocks are so ridiculously expensive. What I’ve learnt is that waiting for valuation to catch up a bit usually means you always missed the train.

2504 2019-03-09 04:40:48 Idk. It depends heavily on the amount of float. Both rely entirely on a lack of liquidity. ie.

2531 2019-03-09 04:21:25 I was originally in the group that ran it it up to 14 cents but pretty sure there was a guy in there that was taking advantage. Pretty sure he’s doing that with multiple stocks lol
2532 2019-03-09 04:20:50 Dear @bigbasket_com please don't use the platform to push near expiry or expire products. It's pathetic. Get fresh stocks. You can manage inventory better. Buying near expiry products at dirt cheap price and selling is bad for brand.
2533 2019-03-09 04:18:36 Stocks?
2534 2019-03-09 04:17:11 Natasha, lives on Osterman Drive with lots of dogs.

Put all their savings into maca root stocks. Can't retire.
2535 2019-03-09 04:16:04 The short targets may need to put in handles.  the groups showing weakness r primarily HC n energy. then there r some stocks w structural issues if mkt breaks down (after basing) i am almost sure financials n tech will join the action
2536 2019-03-09 04:15:36 Supposedly, yes. Pero di kasi nag notify si bighit na limited pala yung stocks for this one. Kaya lahat po ng GOs for DVD and BLURAY on a later date pa yung DOP kasi walang nag expect na ganito mangyayari.
2537 2019-03-09 04:15:02 investing my money in stocks really was the smartest decision I made

2566 2019-03-09 03:47:32 I think the misunderstanding here is that if everyone wants to cover it will drive the stock price up.  That is true unless those that are long (which is far more shares than what is short) are looking to sell above 0.  Stocks are not a zero sum game.

2580 2019-03-09 03:41:32 The stock market argument is laughable. These thieves of society like #LiarKamala take her potential voters as complete idiots. People use orange juice, computers, cell phones, silver, lead and more. Stocks are an indicator of how these markets affect all of us.

2585 2019-03-09 03:33:11 Mr. dimmadome, as we all know you’re stocks skyrocketed after the 9/11 attacks. So just be honest with us: did you have anything to do with those planes hitting the twin towers?
2586 2019-03-09 03:32:22 She is right about the market being up only for those that have stocks
2587 2019-03-09 03:32:21 Andre was 20/23/2 w/ 5 stocks to 2 TO.  +8.  The only thing trying to play defense in that first half.  9-14 from the floor (and one 3pt heave).

2594 2019-03-09 03:26:39 Unfortunately not- looks like secondary offering brought it down and they´re expecting data from multiple ILD cohorts this year. A few months ago in ROTY we made a change to scanning criteria and I´ve limited coverage to stocks that have $100M market cap or higher.

2600 2019-03-09 03:20:21 When corporate assets are in stocks, and buybacks inflate the value, then the value of the company goes up with no increase in capital/inventory/personnel/productivity.

If the business is unchanged, and the value goes up, how is that not artificial?
2601 2019-03-09 03:17:01 Hey Trump Jr: speaking of “sneaky anti-second amendment legislation, your daddy imposed a ban and confiscation of bump stocks on 400,000 responsible law abiding citizens who have done absolutely nothing wrong. Perhaps you could talk to him about your concerns huh?

2604 2019-03-09 03:16:00 Stocks are relatively high risk/reward relative to bonds or cash.

companies doing buybacks is not some wicked scheme. It increases the share price (all else being equal) but there’s nothing artificial about it.
2605 2019-03-09 03:15:43 Spoke about the root of why it’s like this, how we are behind at buying stocks and bonds and homes like our white counterparts. The opposite of why he even referred the article  Which adds on to my point of finding offense. Don’t belittle us and “scare” us for a vote
2606 2019-03-09 03:15:27 I won’t feel sorry for SEGA when the stocks are in a critical state. IMO, it IS actually the worst company ever known on Earth.

2665 2019-03-09 02:11:36 Keep your hands off my stock trades Cortez.  Many middle class taxpayers own stocks. We don’t need more taxes from people like you.  You are a fake phone fraud and a hypocrite
2666 2019-03-09 02:11:20 Just wanna thank Tiki for the assistance during that tournament. She’s better at taking stocks than anyone else

2670 2019-03-09 02:04:38 People are making money off stocks & 401Ks which a lot of people have for retirement cause those companies are doing good which is helping people that work for them as well. Having 2 jobs doesn’t help unemployment either. And we want these idiots running our country??

2673 2019-03-09 01:57:23 People have VERY  short memories indeed. I worked in a large Tesco superstore 1971-1974. As soon as we entered the Common Market staple foods prices shot up! Cheaper NZ lamb and butter got replaced by dearer French stuff. African & USA fruits swapped with dearer euro stocks. Etc!
2674 2019-03-09 01:57:15 Evening Market Wrap-up: stocks fell on weak US jobs report and now looking for a confirmation of support.
2675 2019-03-09 01:57:11 Oh I totally agree. The housing market is on its way down, and the bull market in stocks is likely in its final run.
2676 2019-03-09 01:55:38 Played in my first wifi crew battle for Full Power and took 8 stocks with Ridley :)
2677 2019-03-09 01:55:27 Sounds like you short pot stocks with that kind of an attitude. 
2678 2019-03-09 01:54:55 @tailopez the quickest way to deal with depression I feel is set goals. After setting goals to master sales, stocks, investment real estate, fitness, vegan nutrition, mindfulness, yoga, and meditation my happiness went up 100X. I feel WAY more motivated like never before. Hmm....
2679 2019-03-09 01:50:04 @WiseAzz78 @Helper that’s one of my favorite things find stocks with <500 followers. WK another software unknown that I own

2687 2019-03-09 01:45:19 I don’t know when Bush cashed in his oil stocks but...all the other examples you cited were from after their respective Presidential terms were over. Which I have some objections to but really aren’t in the same league.
2688 2019-03-09 01:45:12 I think she knows she's wrong, but she also knows she speaking to a group that doesn't know any better... Many people do own stocks, if they have a 401k or similar. And unemployment means you have no job; having one job or ten jobs doesn't change the fact that you are employed.

2706 2019-03-09 01:29:13 Dead serious. I straight up told somebody I'm broke as hell. I live in poverty. I can barely afford to buy stocks and save money, let alone afford to be a rapper. Can't afford to get a house. One parent, she has no real money. It's real out here for #ADOS
2707 2019-03-09 01:29:03 I should've trusted my intuition a little more. Had a chance to buy some stocks.. I'm still kicking my ass over it!

2847 2019-03-08 23:24:21 Article says "the creek is expected to return to normal in one to two years." That prompted me to look at articles on Salmon stock decline in BC. Many of which said that what was "normal" was serious decline in salmon stocks.

2854 2019-03-08 23:21:09 Warning after warning was derided, mocked and ignored. Only when fish stocks collapsed, did the industry and politicians, realise the warning about over fishing would destroy the grand banks. Those fishing grounds fed Europe for over two years.
2855 2019-03-08 23:20:04 Your pinned tweet is from a guy who sold all his stocks 3 years ago because Trump was gonna collapse the economy.
2856 2019-03-08 23:17:37 Yep!  And the font I use on iRacing specifically because of how many 90's late models and pro stocks used it lmao.
2857 2019-03-08 23:17:33 Volume profile displays trading activity at specified price levels. How many stocks was traded at that price.

2876 2019-03-08 22:55:44 Not for me. My systems' rules (trend entries & exits, stop losses, etc) and markets (long/short, FX, FI, commods & stocks) have a good edge. Non-system trades/risk mgmt can't make performance better than the system rules. I will accept lower perf to make sure I survive.
2877 2019-03-08 22:55:26 Have you checked your stocks lately?

Or the forecast of only a 2% or less GDP this year?

2929 2019-03-08 22:17:10 Thanks!
2930 2019-03-08 22:16:44 Yes, investors should look at the shares bought vs dilution on exec stock plan shares issued. People, in general, do not do enough basic work on their stocks.
2931 2019-03-08 22:16:20 Very true. Sometimes it's just, "Hey, I've never charted that one before." Practicing on something you have no interest in is good for keeping any bias out, so you know the chart is speaking for itself, whether it's crypto or uranium or rubles or stocks in beauty salon products.
2932 2019-03-08 22:16:12 Today one of the vendors that stocks shelves at the grocery store I work at was leaving and said "have a good day beautiful".. And I'm creeped out because he's never tried to have a conversation w/ me at all but he does stare all the time like, wtf.. Don't be fuckin weird??!
2933 2019-03-08 22:15:46 It’s not a popular statement that the stocks crash... just a mathematically correct one 
2934 2019-03-08 22:14:26 WPCT has unquoted stocks in it.I'mbiased here because I'm short,but that should tell you what I think.
2935 2019-03-08 22:13:27 amazing ramp up in stocks into the closing bell.   however, we did get the outside reversal week in #ESH9 with the close under 2775 and #NQH9 under 7048.
2936 2019-03-08 22:13:17 stocks go up stocks go down why nobody knows
2937 2019-03-08 22:11:43 Yes, but there is no way that 3% is real unless you are comparing post 2000 numbers. If I have an index called the Steve Index and I have oil stocks in it, then after 2000 I put telecom stocks in it, comparisons have no meaning.
2938 2019-03-08 22:11:27 Not me. I have stocks but never forex

2943 2019-03-08 22:08:31 I know it was a rough week, but today felt like a victory for the bulls, no? Most stocks closed significantly off the lows.  @CNBCFastMoney
2944 2019-03-08 22:08:29 @CNBCFastMoney this  show! they think because stocks were manipulated up in last 15 mins, all is good? lol. if they had closed on the lows or closed where they were at 3-3:30, they’d be calling for a crash @RiskReversal @timseymour

No, no, no, my dear. In a capitalist system, we do not speculate on people being profitable in the future, only stocks and numbers on a spreadsheet.
2948 2019-03-08 22:04:48 The election fraud and Russian thing aren't the only indictable problem with this president. How about stock manipulation starting with prison stocks and Boeing to Amazon.

3046 2019-03-08 21:10:53 @Spacefox_shop Nice, la seule taille dont j'ai besoin est en rupture de Stock sur le Sweat Citizen, alors que les stocks viennent d'êtres refaits apparemment...
3047 2019-03-08 21:10:45 I keep hearing Analysts say European and other non-US stocks are “cheap”. When the same countries have been “cheap” for the last decade or more, they’re most likely garbage and not this treasure-trove of hidden value.
3048 2019-03-08 21:10:44 Wall Street Instant Update; At the close #Stocks wrap up a weak week with the Dow Industrials off lows Friday and down by 23 points at 25,459

3049 2019-03-08 21:09:19 As well as: "Buy stocks. No worry buy them" Im telling; They are selling right now.
3050 2019-03-08 21:09:05 @935K3 yeah you’re right.. reason China stocks went down was because of everything else but trumps trade war too.Just because they had a run
3051 2019-03-08 21:08:45 Haha honestly I did not read any books. I taught myself through YouTube . I prob watched every single “how to trade stocks/options” video I could find in the search and practiced myself lol
3052 2019-03-08 21:08:44 Stocks slide down for the 5th day in a row, job growth is poor, our trade deficit skyrocketing due to your tariffs, and millions of middle class Americans are writing large checks to the IRS thanks to your #GOPTaxScam. So much winning, Donnie, I don't think we can take much more!
3053 2019-03-08 21:07:53 Wish I could set stops on $CSE stocks @BanqueCIBC get your $hit together!
3054 2019-03-08 21:07:52 Invest that money in stocks, a good investment account.  Stop buying nonsense.
3055 2019-03-08 21:07:04 Just recommend the beginners guide and stocks for dummies books... so I can call off this fight I'm finna call the next time I see you at brunch 
3056 2019-03-08 21:06:49 You've also caused a crushing global economic slowdown and stocks have gone nowhere in a year.  So maybe you want to stop showing how stupid the policy and not brag about it.  If I were you, I'd focus on something else.
3057 2019-03-08 21:06:41 $AAPL was the leader today.  Barely flinched all day from 169.5 to 173.  When markets are weak it's typical for the raccoons to go after the solid names like Apple.  There are worse stocks to hold if it slips over the weekend.
3058 2019-03-08 21:06:35 Agreed. I think of all the pot stocks, this one has the most room to run if you're looking at a 1 to 2 year timeframe. I just can't stop buying at these levels. Got my average down to $2.82 now. Still down, obviously, but not for long. April's ER will change all that.
3059 2019-03-08 21:06:25 US stocks closed slightly lower after a late rally: #DJIA -23, #SPX -6
3060 2019-03-08 21:05:34 I think after today's plunge in Shanghai, the few jobs added and the stalling trade negotiations you have to see this close as what it is: economic warfare. It's designed to give Trump leverage over Xi: "your stocks our down, ours are flat". Manipulation and everyone knows it.

3080 2019-03-08 20:53:47 I am afraid that you have misunderstood  the effect of this. Only pur upstream oil companies will be divested. Most of the portfolio of oil companies, the stocks owned in integrated oil majors, will not be sold. Norway is still «all in» in oil.

3094 2019-03-08 20:44:57 Why Th? Uranium is extraordinarily abundant and cheap. Spent fuel is far easier to recycle into new nuclear fuel than to breed thorium to fuel. 
Absurd to go and dig up new thorium to breed into fuel, when there are enormous waste stocks of U-238 enrichment tailings to breed 1st.
3095 2019-03-08 20:43:48 I did ( and I am a bond guy). having said that... @DiMartinoBooth  talks that talk as well.
BUT, two things:
1. if a lot of bonds lose their IG, they'll displace already sub IG bonds in the meager amount of money eligible to own them;
2. which means that IMHO they'll push stocks.
3096 2019-03-08 20:42:36 The S&P500 is trading like it got out on the wrong side of bed today, but has bounced from the lows, to be at 2734.0 (-0.55%). Another example of deep state actors betraying the working … oh, sorry #wrongmeeting #stocks
3097 2019-03-08 20:42:03 Jack doesn´t own 100% of twitter stocks, thus a drop in market capitalization does´nt directly carry over to him.

3101 2019-03-08 20:40:41 When emotions are running high among traders stocks can be very irrational and not respect typical patterns and indicators.
3102 2019-03-08 20:40:19 The difference is time, the owner may not want to sell at the time. These days, there's usually no actual selling of stocks that happens, someone just buys the "put", and that someone pays you if it goes down, or you pay them when it goes up. Legalized betting for the rich.

3105 2019-03-08 20:39:41 fact: in a stock market uptrend, many investors became bearish of dips and sell their stocks.  buying dips in uptrends works better.  fact: in a stock market downtrend, investors become bullish of rallies and buy stocks.  but selling those rallies works better.

3169 2019-03-08 20:05:12 USDA kept its estimates unchanged for US LG rice. It did raise the minimum of the LG farm gate price up by 20  cents per cwt.  For SG/MG rice, USDA estimates higher imports, lower exports, and higher ending stocks.
3170 2019-03-08 20:05:06 Social Security Should Buy Stocks, Like Norway Does.,Norway's giant state pension fund is in the headlines because it decided to stop investing in energy exploration and production, or upstream oil.-maybe congress and the house of reps should keep their hands off of our SSN money

3172 2019-03-08 20:01:56 Stocks fall for a fifth straight session after the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 20% from Christmas Eve until the closing high of 2,803 hit March
3173 2019-03-08 20:01:44 Markets rather quiet this afternoon after after several hurdles were jumped this week. Mortgage Bonds slightly higher, Stocks lower but hold
3174 2019-03-08 20:01:19 And let's not forget the risk of idols of the same company dating like in CUBE, YG & SM. It would give them more opportunity to meet.
Everytime a dating scandal occurs the company involved loses stocks. BH is not yet stable enough financially to endure that kind of scandals.

3183 2019-03-08 19:57:29 It's the tendency for cannabis stocks to sell off or rise at certain times of the year. I don't see enough evidence myself to support that theory yet, but some believe it.
3184 2019-03-08 19:57:26 Stock markets really are the most inefficient and illogical markets. You’d never Pat above sticker for a car because the salesman told you the last guy did. Yet dimwits do it all the time with stocks.
3185 2019-03-08 19:57:02 Agreed, feel strangely sanguine about my U stocks, as you say- a lot of discouragement from many, in the face of fundamentals, if not today then getting v.close to an important turn.

3196 2019-03-08 19:49:24 very typical movement since 2010.  FED says hike too much.  Stocks sells and bonds rally cuz fed going to cause recession.  Fed apologizes.  Stocks rally and bonds stay at same price.

3200 2019-03-08 19:48:10 Bonds are ignoring the bounce in stocks for now.
3201 2019-03-08 19:46:49 I'm happy that I'm not 100% correct on what I post about the market. One week I was 100% correct for 3days. 12 stocks hitting targets as the market was moving slow to other Traders. By that 3rd day I got bored and depressed. I learned a lot about myself that day 
3202 2019-03-08 19:46:30 Pump it up. I love $AMZN because all this stupidity about taking over the world does damage to good stocks. Bought $UPS @ 93 for fear of prime delivery. Bought $CVS $52.6 for similar stupidity...and...well...Aetna.
3203 2019-03-08 19:46:25 Finally stocks are moving
3204 2019-03-08 19:46:17 Stocks fall for a fifth straight session after the S&P 500 rose nearly 20% from Christmas Eve until the closing high of 2,803 hit March 1. Global growth worries push equities lower this week and in the absence of any trade news between the U.S. and China.

Let’s get it
3216 2019-03-08 19:38:03 Just like with stocks, you buy low when the stock has potential to bounce back but performs bad.  Low risk/high reward.  You don't buy high on poor stock performance.
3217 2019-03-08 19:37:42 @SMCya21 I know you mentioned the small capital market stocks like GHL yesterday. Morgan Stanley really rebounded from this morning. Do you look at the reversal or the fact it made a new low today? Which is more significant?
3218 2019-03-08 19:37:00 You mean giving  gamblers like you hope. Anyone holding $TSLA right now is gambling  not investing.

3225 2019-03-08 19:28:37 Judging from price action, when SPX loses another 100 points, apparently the stocks with the highest p/e will be priced higher $TWLO $117 $SHOP $189 Doesn't matter how high they go, it's never high enough for these greedy

3230 2019-03-08 19:26:34 Yup so it doesn't hurt my feelings. That's the PC way of Fintwit  I think new ATHs are a decent possibility given new ATHs in certain industries, stocks like $BA, 20-30% rips in Chinese stocks, etc. We'll see. I find no value in predictions, just trade setups as they come.
3231 2019-03-08 19:26:07 #WallStreet@Afternoon: A big miss on the NonFarm payrolls growth in February is pushing down on equities; tightening the noose for 5th day in row. Norway's shuffle on Energy bears heavily on stocks. China's Export flop unmoving. #DJIA -0.55% #NASDAQ -0.66% #SP500 -0.72%.
3232 2019-03-08 19:25:43 They’re kind of the ones driving the market down and I think your call for a bounce was good considering that after of the support levels on the banks were to break it would been a landslide to the major gap fills on bank stocks like Bank of America.
3233 2019-03-08 19:25:01 The thing I’ve been scratching my head about is growth stocks and gold both rising...

3245 2019-03-08 19:18:23 He has no losings MUs and has the ability to equalize stocks faster than arguably anyone else. He can also force approaches on most the cast, and can escape a lot of kills with whistle. Overall he's super strong with a few weak areas that aren't nearly as bad as people think.
3246 2019-03-08 19:18:09 I know what you mean.  Being from the pacific northwest coast where salmon stocks are less than 10% of what they were and many runs are extinct feels very post-apocalyptic.
3247 2019-03-08 19:17:58 I think if #RMP did go the same way as Colter, then Oil stocks across the whole of the LSE would be affected for a very long time.
3248 2019-03-08 19:16:37 I wrote yesterday of thinking about the market as a parabolic move. Stocks move with more and more force each day, week, etc. until the top pops off. We may have had that day yesterday. Thanks for the thought Michail.

3261 2019-03-08 19:12:07 They usually target around 2%. To me just a plucked out of the air Fed-ism.  To stop it there (if its rising) they would have to raise rates. In the current environment and rate, increasing rates is probably not going to boost the market. Letting it run might keep stocks up.
3262 2019-03-08 19:12:01 Ever wondered how and why we classify stocks? Dale Standley of Farmers Trust will be on WFMJ Today on Monday, March 11th, to help explain the factors that go into these classifications.

3284 2019-03-08 19:03:22 The White Supremacy Hate Groups and Trump will not like this, let alone this just might make Wall Street see stocks falling again.
3285 2019-03-08 19:03:11 No. A low P/E can mean that there are troubles at a company. But not always. And low P/E companies right now, true value stocks, are pretty despised by the Street even if their business is doing well.
3286 2019-03-08 19:03:04 @60Minutes stocks and bonds (claims on earnings or future income payments).Remember, the asset side of the Fed’s balance sheet expanded to over $4 trillion during the bailout of Wall Street and shareholders post-2008. And if the Fed were to buy riskier assets –
3287 2019-03-08 19:02:13 Just compared you faves debut picture with mine. They need got7 first to debut the group under them. If you said in 2015 twice helps with the addition of his stocks i can agree with that. But to said they saved jype...that’s ridiculous
3288 2019-03-08 19:02:05 Oui mais il n'ont pas trouvé de gilets jaunes dans les stocks alors ça s'explique !

3290 2019-03-08 19:01:27 The only people who will benefit from artificially inflated stock prices are those who were invested in those stocks before buy backs occur.
3291 2019-03-08 19:00:41 Thats why he continued to debut got7. After got7 debuted, his stocks RISE. And its all over the news. Remember, your faves got more attention bcs ppl aready know them bcs they already got promoted in a survival show bfr meanwhile got7 need to raise themselves up

3303 2019-03-08 18:55:29 Yes my trading account is pure technical.  Longer-term accounts are mix of passive and fundamentals heavy in REITS and Divie stocks there
3304 2019-03-08 18:53:47 Not everywhere especially, where I was born and grew up in Embu. We tended to individual family stocks only linking up with others of neighbourhood at watering point at Kavingaci River. We mixed rarely to eat FREE ripe bananas as sugarcane known as "Nginda arithi" - herders'foord

And it blew up in a way he didn’t inteded to, the stocks went up so he can’t just say“guys it was a joke” he would lose the case
3307 2019-03-08 18:52:33 They should be relegated & stripped of all recent titles won by systematically Cheating on a grand scale

Time to deal with @ManCity once & for all, its taken 10yrs
3308 2019-03-08 18:52:27 @no_pullbacks that fraud @thedailygold published a bearish article on gold & gold stocks yesterday. Naturally, they are all up today. He blocked me, he's a coward.
3309 2019-03-08 18:51:55 as stock market goes up or down, individual stocks go way up and way down and way up and way down again within it. same thing. Same thing
3310 2019-03-08 18:51:38 Kinda wanna learn how to move the right things around in my 401k to keep it investing in the best stocks it possibly can so i can make more long term money, but don't really want to fuck up and do the wrong thing. Hmmmmmm
3311 2019-03-08 18:51:29 @Bullish_Bull81 @stockery ignorance..tell your politician to keep politics out of stocks “bro”

3320 2019-03-08 18:41:43 It’s extremely tough to trade right now. Long term, I still think the market will continue to consolidate or pullback a little bit, but those stocks that still seem to be performing well like $MSEX seem good for investments. Especially anything recession proofish.
3321 2019-03-08 18:41:42 Agreed, they’ve decimated our O&G sector...and with him buying the stocks it seems not for the altruism and concern for the earth but for his own personal gain
The man is pure evil
3322 2019-03-08 18:41:34 this is a nice bottom area here imo 1.43 then we start to head up and get a squeeze to boot!!  $8-$10 targets not out of reach in time

3329 2019-03-08 18:37:52 Yeah, it's annoying how few people play along, though. I just want to be treated like a kid. It's not that hard. Why are you suddenly wanting to talk about stocks, or politics, or watch R-rated movies, and making fun of me for not being interested?
3330 2019-03-08 18:37:50 Wernick mentioned that the new evidence he wanted JWR to consider was the stocks of SNC taking a drop.  Is is possible to take a look at who in the PMO has stocks in SNC?
3331 2019-03-08 18:37:33 Every those stocks will be 50% less before this month end!
If you are honestly bullish & technically brilliant hold it till this month end tweet with proof!
Deal or No Deal?
3332 2019-03-08 18:36:58 Most of them make these claims, but it is a lie.  They simply use a cut out.  Rather than investing directly in an oil stock, they invest in a fund, like Vanguard, that invests in oil stocks.  They know 99.99% won't do the research.
3333 2019-03-08 18:36:46 It's true that money was in the bank before they bought back stocks. But banks were also doing buy backs... So what you see as possible business loans for normal people, were actually just being used for this exact buy back process.

3350 2019-03-08 18:25:07 That’s because people were buying stocks of them 
3351 2019-03-08 18:25:02 @MelissaLeeCNBC Melissa, why do you think Ackman's $qsr and $cmg are the  only restaurant stocks trading at 4x's sales? Makes no sense. How is he managing this? They only seem to go up.

3359 2019-03-08 18:23:41 It is not abnormal for stocks to fall on a Friday exactly a week before the Ides of March in the year before a presidential election in which the first two numbers of the year match the second two.

3421 2019-03-08 17:59:28 By the end of 2019 I’m going to be a 6-figure earner. I’m going to invest my money everywhere. Both small and large businesses, start-up businesses, real estate, stocks, mutual funds, and anything else that can make me more sources of income.
3422 2019-03-08 17:58:01 I just want my stocks already man

3424 2019-03-08 17:57:23 I invested in 3 stocks within the last 2 days: Dr. Pepper, Spotify, and a diversified account
3425 2019-03-08 17:56:34 Thats boring. How about, when trade deal was signed, China took foot off monetary gas and US stocks collapsed.
3426 2019-03-08 17:56:04 Broader mkt is down the last 2 sessions but NVTA up 10%...relative strength vs other stocks/indices
3427 2019-03-08 17:53:55 Great accept the towers are shorter and closer together and they have no clue how the EM waves affect the human body over time...but we will have fast 911
3428 2019-03-08 17:53:21 Not a chance big money touches this pump and dump. If the people writing good things on $kndi actually covered other stocks it might be believable. Endless red flags (my opinion, not investment advice)
3429 2019-03-08 17:52:47 Boy don't even know how stocks work
3430 2019-03-08 17:52:41 Bounces off the lows in many stocks are losing momentum as more than a few turn positive - review these against your 620s.
3431 2019-03-08 17:51:40 Sold 25% of $XLNX stocks to preserve profits. Planning to double that count with with options when dust settles. Still very bullish on the growth of FPGAs in #5g and compute/network/storage acceleration.

3434 2019-03-08 17:51:03 Has to be some stocks doing well on their own. Small biotechnology stocks with life changing products? Strong cash flow cos without debt?
3435 2019-03-08 17:50:59 Having a hard time figuring out what sucks more right now.  The performance of my @CrackerBarrel #stocks or the @Giants front office moves.  It’s like the #gmen are trying to be as bad as the @nyknicks

3444 2019-03-08 17:48:14 Yes, I model changes in stock prices related to changes in NGDP growth that way. Md shocks like a proportional increase in discount rate for stocks in discounted earnings/dividends model. Effective increase in cost of capital.

3451 2019-03-08 17:44:56 I do too. I’ve noted an interesting shift in sector interest on the markets. As Retail, Construction, Banks, Food, Telecomms etc are all flailing there is a renewed interest in the unsexy industrial stocks. Stocks that get stuff done with real assets. GND would be one of those.

3463 2019-03-08 17:41:27 Something fishy in the corn market, stocks under 2BB YOY, massive deliveries, wettest winter/springs on record. Production issues since 12 have been more related to too wet vs too dry. Are large commercials pushing deliveries on 55MB to tale wag the market so they can buy 5.5BB

3480 2019-03-08 17:35:02 What’s fueling this bizarre idea is the fact investor sentiment on US stocks remains robust even after a shit load of evidence shows the economy is in crisis. This warped reality has created this warped theory!

3659 2019-03-08 16:17:57 Frozen #pork supplies were up 11% from the previous month but down 3% from last year. Stocks of pork bellies were up 27% from last month and up 23% from last year.
3660 2019-03-08 16:17:32 Another great piece. My own view is it’s probaly wise to start scaling in slowly, adding on pullbacks. Doubtful stocks will hit ath’s again this year. And Eventually the dollar will be in trouble w/ all that debt.

3674 2019-03-08 16:11:25 Why would you even consider this as an investment option? The returns are usually subpar and take a lifetime to get them back. Even if I was a old millionaire I rather use my extra cash to play with stocks/call options.

3678 2019-03-08 16:10:53 Agree with all that but if 7b people earn nada on "protective assets" like bonds don't they push out the risk spectrum and make stocks look more attractive? Yes, if global recession hits long duration bonds win big but otherwise growth in slow growth world wins pretty well

3711 2019-03-08 16:01:07 Stocks like $TWLO & $TEAM continue to act well and are doing a great job getting rid of weak hands. Closely monitoring them to see if they properly set up again. Also a great means of gauging market health & risk-on appetite.
3712 2019-03-08 16:00:43 Same goes for salmon hatcheries. People think they are producing fish to rebuild wild stocks. They are actually bad for wild stocks and are only creating fish for humans to catch. The DFO has long had the stance that the only good hatchery fish is a dead one.

3776 2019-03-08 15:35:43 thanks for your reply;what stocks/companies are aligned with the #5G, an upcoming standard for mobile  telecommunications service that promises to be significantly faster  than today's 4G ...--- just $T and Verizon?
3777 2019-03-08 15:35:29 Well at the end of the year was a good time.. actually interestingly Vol stayed high even when Stocks were recovering.
Low in SPX on 24th of Dec, High in Vol only on Dec27..
3778 2019-03-08 15:35:03 hey man, STT Pro didn't do anything for me on this particular trade... i took the trade... what STT PRO did for me, is Tim Bohen educated me, taught me to have a plan, we discuss ideas daily ... two live webinars daily (no other program has that)...
hope this is satisfactory 4U
3779 2019-03-08 15:34:33 Started investing in stocks today. Ion know what tf I just bought but hopefully that shit skyrocket lol
3780 2019-03-08 15:34:32 The S&P500 is trading quite miserably today, but has bounced from the lows, to be at 2728.0 (-0.76%). My followers are the smart ones - join them for direct feeds #follow #goodidea #stocks
3781 2019-03-08 15:33:46 Hi Luke, how will gold stocks compare to owning gold? Will owning fiat currency denominated stocks prevent real value appreciation over owning physical gold, even if the stocks go up proportionally (or more) to the gold increase?

3784 2019-03-08 15:33:08 How about they release a list of stocks purchased relative to bills voted on. And whatever happened to using tax payer’s dollars as hush money for sexual assaults ?
3785 2019-03-08 15:32:43 Ben Shapiro would agree. The fact that guns with wood stocks aren’t as scary as a gun with a black stock. Then a gun with a tactical stock is horrifying. Its an analogy lol
3786 2019-03-08 15:32:34 I thought rising USD was supposed to be good for stocks...what is this red I see?
3787 2019-03-08 15:32:01 DAX March options expires on March 15th. That could bring additonal volatility and a pullback #volatility #dax #options #stockindex #stocks
3788 2019-03-08 15:31:58 It is actually a fair question. I couldn't find anything to say that it wasn't. Obama famously said at the bottom (after most likely gaining knowledge from the Fed) in March 2009, "buying stocks is a potentially good deal."
3789 2019-03-08 15:31:49 gotta go with D, it will never fail you, parts are available everywhere and you can buy different barrels or stocks to suit your needs.

3791 2019-03-08 15:31:11 Oh where is the spot on the calendar where it says Powell is going to be on 60 minutes? Do you realize how crazy this is? Is this going to be the place where he announces that the Fed is just going to buy stocks in the open market?
3792 2019-03-08 15:30:27 I was with STT PRO and I don´t see the "value" for the price they have... Instead I move to TC2000 only for charting and it´s going well. Can I ask you, why you are saying STT PRO help you on this specific trade?  $SEEL
3793 2019-03-08 15:29:22 To me the Indexes are saying “party’s over” and they want to go home. Some leading stocks still want to stay up and mingle LOL $SPX
3794 2019-03-08 15:29:10 Stocks lower soon after the open though off worst levels. Dow -144 points.
3795 2019-03-08 15:28:39 As the saying goes, its a market of stocks, not a stock market. While it is a bad day for the major averages, my portfolio is up almost 1%
3796 2019-03-08 15:28:23 It only covers a tiny fraction ~5% of their acreage in Nevada. They have massive hemp acreage!
3797 2019-03-08 15:28:16 You're right. The solution is shorter sentences ending with the stocks in the public square.... for white collar crimes, anyway.

3800 2019-03-08 15:27:35 Only 20,000 jobs created in February 165,000 less then expected. Guess we need to give the rich and corporations another #TaxCut so they can buy back stocks and give some a one time bonus, I mean temporarily create some jobs.
3801 2019-03-08 15:27:31 Bearish note: Trade deficit hits 10 – year high as signs of slowing economic growth keep rolling in. Bullish note: U.S. companies ready to buy back $226 bn of their own stock until Feb '19 #stocks #economicgrowth #GDP #macroeconomics

3804 2019-03-08 15:26:40 Yes, people are selling off stocks, but guess who's waiting to buy them at the lowest price? Trump's rich crooked cronies!
3805 2019-03-08 15:26:33 The NASD OTC Market closed the trading week on a negative note. The USI and Market Capitalisation closed at 1.72% lower than the previous week.

3807 2019-03-08 15:24:45 How much of this was swayed by Vermont? We just enacted some strict gun control laws, banning bump stocks & large capacity mags, & expanding background checks. We've also stifled every school shooting plan, three across the state in the last five years, (I think).

3810 2019-03-08 15:23:54 very surprise. $KR didn't   ...  btw what did i say about the Chinese stocks...when they go risk on its near the end of the current upmove
3811 2019-03-08 15:23:23 And yet if you buy enough low p/e ratio stocks whole avoiding those with high debt you will again find that the humble p/e ratio works in the long run...just not always for individual names.
3812 2019-03-08 15:23:17 China should do no trade deal, sink stocks, sink Trump and then back to normal business.
3813 2019-03-08 15:23:05 Estoy operando Forex con MT4 y Broker Pepperstone, pero esto no tiene Stocks...
3814 2019-03-08 15:22:44 I got so many stocks. It’s crazy. Pilling up money over the past year to invest really paid off
3815 2019-03-08 15:22:17 Qué plataforma y que Broker usan para hacer Trading de Stocks?
3816 2019-03-08 15:21:57 FOX business news headline for this morning. 
“ Stocks Add to Decline”..
because They all have their tongue in Trump’s ass
3817 2019-03-08 15:20:54 Won’t the robots/ai lead to a huge run in stocks as companies no longer pay ppl and instead have the one time fee of a machine?
3818 2019-03-08 15:20:50 These are temporary bad numbers due to stock market collapse in Dec. Stocks have recovered and new net worth has returned to previous or higher values. Everyone knows this. They just want bad news to make everyone think things are bad. Election coming & Trump must be stopped.
3819 2019-03-08 15:20:40 Bought me some stocks and bonds earlier this week. .
3820 2019-03-08 15:20:35 If this shitshow flushes without POTUS announcing that everyone should perhaps taper out quickly (since he did tell everyone on 12/26 to buy stocks), 2020 becomes a WWE event.
3821 2019-03-08 15:20:27 Hi Mols, sorry to hear that you weren't able to pick up a coin. Unfortunately these were only available while stocks lasted we're afraid
3822 2019-03-08 15:20:07 My stocks up 0.13% while S&P down 0.85%! God good to me suddenly?
3823 2019-03-08 15:19:57 COMPARED TO YESTERDAY’S RANGE (20190308 10:18 am ET)
3.3% of stocks are above yesterday’s high.

42.9% are below yesterday’s low.

3840 2019-03-08 15:15:17 Lol, very true... baby boomers are also investing in stocks to get rich... does that make stocks a fraud?
3841 2019-03-08 15:15:08 Why because umemployment for blacks and Hispanics and women is at an all time low?  Because our stocks are finally making money?  Or because over 3mm people are now off the food stamp program ?

3858 2019-03-08 15:09:26 mkt and stocks gonna see ups and downs for quite a while... completely sidelined and just watch.... in times of this, the more you trade, the more likely you kiss yourself into a hole and hurt acct.... so use light $ making some quick profits at most, or simply relax and watch...

“Stocks are up. But no collusion, no collusion.”

3881 2019-03-08 15:02:23 No, you wouldn’t want all alts to be securities, the less broad the definition is the better.

But securities aren’t good just for being securities, many are scams and many securities tokens will be scams or low quality.

What this does is make existing stocks move better
3882 2019-03-08 15:02:02 Just heard Trump talk about how the Stock has been great the last couple months on CNBC and next to the headlines are updated stocks & their down.

3892 2019-03-08 14:57:34 Financial journalists should do exactly that; regularly write about all asset classes and after tax return, future probabilities rather than historical frequency based statistics etc. But this would mean talking about other things than stocks which is where the industry makes $$.

3899 2019-03-08 14:55:31 I am long in this stock since $0.35, still with a substantial position. I believe this has a lot more upside. I buy stocks that are growth markets with strong management teams, especially in early stage companies. I believe Cronos has the best team out there.

3947 2019-03-08 14:40:00 My opinion on saving vs immediacy of your goal. Short-term: A high-yield savings account will give you the best short-term return while keeping your funds easy to access when you need them. Long-term: savings are better off invested in stocks, bonds, index or mutual funds

3967 2019-03-08 14:30:04 Pretty big miss on the employment numbers. Initial jump in tsys is what one would expect but this retracement all the way back is not (bonds at lows). Could be hard to read the context today. Have to see what happens when stocks open.

3999 2019-03-08 14:18:41 a Golden Cross occurs when the 50 day moving average rises above its 200 day average. Typically a telltale sign of bullish sentiment for a stock, reinforced by high trading volumes. Technical traders will often buy stocks in the moments following a Golden Cross @SatoshiLite

4025 2019-03-08 14:10:12 I agree. I was specifically talking about individual stocks, and the risk it poses on the overall market sentiment.

4032 2019-03-08 14:07:15 Hi Laura,  Sorry to hear that you weren't able to pick up a coin last night- unfortunately, these were only available while stocks lasted we're afraid
4033 2019-03-08 14:07:08 That's why I've been buying. Not due to my expertise -- I left that in my other pants -- but damn, these stocks are beaten down, AND they have growth, AND they pay good dividends. Tremendous opportunities.
4034 2019-03-08 14:06:28 Early for a low in stocks.. And areas today important are $SPX Fut 2729-30 and below that 2719, and then 2699-2700-  Most Daily charts indicate another 2-3 days of selling, but if 2719 was reached today it would be right to cover some shorts into weekend-  @newtonadvisors

4038 2019-03-08 14:06:10 I’m as middle-class as it gets. I’m tired of the #FakeNews about @realDonaldTrump tax cuts. Without any change to my demographics/financial stability my stocks up 33%, dividends up 25%, income/retirement pay both up almost 3%, and I payed 14% less Fed taxes and +16% more Ca taxes
4039 2019-03-08 14:05:58 This makes me so angry. I'm so ashamed to be a white man in America.  When I travel abroad, I fake a different accent so I won't get called out. If I get recognized as an American...I usually spend 20 minutes apologizing. We're laughing stocks.

4043 2019-03-08 14:04:27 So making fun of stocks is kinda my thing, so maybe stay in your lane?
4044 2019-03-08 14:04:14 The funny thing is, I've seen Chinese stocks (and ETFs that track Chinese stocks) pushed by very smart people recently. Glad I didn't jump in. Sorry for those who did.

4048 2019-03-08 14:02:27 We try our best to make IPOs available on opening day, but we aren't always able to do so. However, stocks are almost always available within a week of the IPO.
4049 2019-03-08 14:02:25 Yes its looking for those hidden gems and watching those that find hidden gems. You have to have good experience to day trade this market. I said only yesterday record matched trades on many stocks. Some losing 30% in less than an hour.

4073 2019-03-08 13:53:59 Hi Dave - From what I gather you're mostly sitting hands or quick hits. What are you looking for the start putting bigger positions on? Is it market related, fresh IPOs, specific levels in your favorite stocks or a combo of all?

4080 2019-03-08 13:51:35 Nobody sell said for a loss. Profits have already been made on these companies though that's decreasing the longer one stays invested. But as investors unload these stocks, the value is going to decrease. Already they aren't tracking the main markets anymore. That's high risk.
4081 2019-03-08 13:51:02 where the stock permabulls at?

stocks go up over the long term, its still true.  i guess its not so easy............................
4082 2019-03-08 13:50:54 They've built a very wealthy economy on the back of oil and gas, 99% of their electricity comes from hydropower, they have huge potential in wind and wave power plus bioenergy from their forests, so they are well placed to divest from their oil & gas stocks in a changing market
4083 2019-03-08 13:50:23 It's like you went round Europe with a shopping cart picking up word stocks, and hand waving when someone pointed out that grammatically it'd be a mess.

4085 2019-03-08 13:49:12 Don't crow too soon or so loudly.  The stage is set for a recession.   Stocks are down.   Wages are sorely lacking for millions of workers.   Job growth in February:  sucked.
4086 2019-03-08 13:49:11 Divesting overnight isn't realistic but within a short period of 1-3/5 years is realistic and smart money approach. Longer than that and the risk increases. Fossil fuel stocks are not tracking the main markets anymore so writing is on the wall.
4087 2019-03-08 13:49:04 Ari- You do know this means nothing to normal people, right? 80% of stocks belong to 10% and humans are being replaced by technology everywhere possible. Normal people need 2 or 3 jobs to make ends meet and 40% don’t have $400. Strong economy talk is for the privileged.
4088 2019-03-08 13:48:57 we should buy stocks in that company!!!

4100 2019-03-08 13:46:00 I think best practice is to consider there to be basically separate local and FX debt stocks. That way easier to look at depreciation, funding currency shocks etc in isolation.

4103 2019-03-08 13:45:15 Well, this one is different as it is essentially buying the entire universe of low P/B US stocks. It’s a proxy for the value “haystack” while Buffett & other active managers are looking for the needles with little long-term success

4109 2019-03-08 13:43:31 Trust me, buying the entire value asset class of stocks in the lowest 1/3 of P/B and holding them until they migrate to growth stocks (i.e. DFLVX) is nowhere near as difficult as the research & due diligence Buffett & active managers are doing
4110 2019-03-08 13:43:09 20K jobs.  So much winning . . .  Oh wait higher taxes, less jobs,  declining stocks, out of control deficits, laughing stock of the world.  #UnfitToBePresident

4112 2019-03-08 13:42:50 The Fed will take a “measured response” to the payroll “miss”. Now, if *stocks* take a non measured fall in response, then the Fed will respond.

4118 2019-03-08 13:39:52 You can also emulate an index fund by directly buying stocks of those symbols that track an index, and thus just pay brokerage when you and sell, as opposed to paying TER. Optimise fees when not beating the market.

4150 2019-03-08 13:29:35 There’s a Q of stocks going backwards today.  
4151 2019-03-08 13:29:17 1. GM isn't selling bonds to raise money.  People buy stocks off other owners. Owners may get dividends or just gains on asset inflation techniques.
ANYHOW, America's financial structure wasn't always tilted this way.  Yet it still worked for business workers and country.
4152 2019-03-08 13:29:17 There is an UN treaty to which the UK has signed up to limiting the total catch of any stock to below a sustainable level.

Fish stocks in shared /bordering waters must be managed by agreement between all countries involved.  Everything else is 
4153 2019-03-08 13:29:17 Good morning.  Hope everyone is well and healthy!  Futures down. Glad we have really  curtailed buying last several days. Markets "talk." Our job. "Listen." We make videos on this every day.  #stocks
4154 2019-03-08 13:28:50 import share in EU-28 high in liquid biofuels (abt 50 %) and pellets (abt 1/3) – which probably have a harsh impact on carbon stocks & sinks elsewhere. These are high risk sources, so should be taken into account.
4155 2019-03-08 13:28:09 Yet Trudeau takes care of the #LavScam so his retirement is secure with those stocks that needed to go through. Makes me sick how our #Veterans are treated. And it's not just this Gov't it has been that way since WWII. FED UP!

4163 2019-03-08 13:25:46 This is huge for the #divestment movement, an affirmation that the smart money is moving out of the dinosaur stocks of coal, oil, gas. This is is oil money saying that the financial future is not in oil money.

4170 2019-03-08 13:20:22 Disappointing Chinese trade data - with the largest decline in exports in three years and a third straight drop in imports - battered sentiment on Friday, sending global stocks lower across the board. The weak numbers added to a string of indications that point to a slowdown.
4171 2019-03-08 13:20:05 stocks moving up so much so quickly it's scary to go long, and scary to go short. great discipline is going to be required today.

4201 2019-03-08 13:04:17 Nobody is saying this is about climate action. It's a pure financial risk play but it's a message for any other institutional investor who thinks that there's a lot money to be made in oil and gas (and coal) stocks. The risk is clearly increasing and the smart money is moving.

4211 2019-03-08 13:01:31 Glad Norway's oil fund is dumping oil & gas stocks from a diversification point of view (Norway is long oil already) - but as a means of stopping climate change, divestment is no more effect I've than prayer breakfasts or ear candling, right?
4212 2019-03-08 13:01:13 Agreed.  

Massive govt and personal debt.  Quantitative Easing.  Long term low interest rates. RRSPs (really really stupid politicians).  Over priced stocks.  Stock buyback and low CAPEX.

We are in for a rough ride in the next downturn.

-Invest in other income streams (stocks, bonds)

4216 2019-03-08 12:55:08 I'm not into shorting stocks, but I am really starting to consider this with SPT, once the Month of March is done, cashed up Co's could drop this pre empting results, making $$$ on the way down.

4221 2019-03-08 12:53:01 Now that I trade options I usually have the opportunity to make 100% or more everyday, and it is much easier than the penny stocks for me, so it doesnt really bug me that I ignored it.

4222 2019-03-08 12:51:39 $agn The only things I am looking to buy today are the rumored takeover stocks.They tend to go up on Friday's. Watch ALXN,NBIX,CLVS, and AGN. But ONLY if the overall markets stabilize.

4224 2019-03-08 12:50:50 Your coins of 1,2,5,  and 10 are practically outdated legal tenders .All are reluctant to take  those but anxious to dispose despite RBI  repeated insistances .Why minting again and spending crores  for those .Banks are also very unwilling to take back those now that in stocks
4225 2019-03-08 12:47:59 I think there’s still a chance the rally from December lows was corrective, not a new impulse wave i up. Meaning a chance the retrace levels $2637 & lower won’t hold, & that $SPX $ES stocks will drop under the December lows. Giving the indices opportunity to prove either way.

4229 2019-03-08 12:45:46 As long you're sensible it should be fine. It's still more than average salary and with less tax. Then move money from growth stocks into fixed/passive income. You could have a 100k income after a couple of years.

4235 2019-03-08 12:40:02 Yeah, the discussion was on how to determine an effective hedge ratio for a portfolio of stocks. 

The way I'd do it is determine the portfolio beta and find the beta normalized notional of the portfolio. 

Then use ATM options to delta hedge to whatever extent desired.

During the dotcom crash 2000-2002, #uranium stocks actually did good because:
1. Production costs > revenues
2. Supply cuts in parallel with nuclear expansion

4361 2019-03-08 11:21:36 Two ways to see Norway's SWF move to divest #oil & gas stocks:
1) Norway is like a heroin dealer praising a healthy lifestyle.
2) It is a legit portfolio strategy: 1/5th of Norway's GDP and 2/3rd of exports are oil&gas. They are already heavily exposed to the sector/price.

4403 2019-03-08 10:46:29 I’ve lived in 6 states and settled in CA. All of the states I previously lived in think I’m a criminal hippie for smoking. Just shows how long a piece of biased legislation can influence a country long after those people and their agenda are dead. Now I’m buying stocks.

4411 2019-03-08 10:39:29 I agree. 
People like Zuckerberg and Buffet became richer because they lived below their means.
But that's cos they are rich.
Poor people shouldnt be comfortable living within or below their means...especially in a Nigeria with rising inflation.

4418 2019-03-08 10:29:52 The mean reversion I am watching is the binary harmonic of the Stocks/Gold ratio which is nested within the Kondratieff cycle (you get two lows and two highs within 1 cycle).

4423 2019-03-08 10:24:48 Not everything. Stocks and Bonds were in a bear market in the 1970s and Gold went up 25x. The difference between then and now would simply be that the background is deflationary and not (stag)inflationary. Gold, however, would still outperform stocks & bonds in a similar fashion.

These are illiquid stocks and may have to fall a lot to find buyers in a pull-back. Or am I missing something?

4522 2019-03-08 08:52:33 Yeah actually. We've constructed Race as a continental / skin distinction.

If you took a genetic view of race, most of the different races are in Africa and the rest of us are practically cousins.

4528 2019-03-08 08:37:25 As I don’t trade crypto anymore. Just Forex and stocks with GBP. All I really need to know are clear tax instructions to spend, receive and hold BSV. Last tax years assessment was a nightmare. Hopefully next years will be a lot clearer once they nail the regulation.
4529 2019-03-08 08:36:18 So i am taking a long weekend off and leaving TDC team 5 in the capable hands of @TheBlackRatt. In truth I ran out of @OfficialHARIBO tangfastics with no stocks in local garages so I've ground to a halt! @RatApprentice keep him out of trouble and remember his cake fine!
4530 2019-03-08 08:35:53 Got 9th today at ESA Roseville losing to @LegitSmash once again  and @MHAlex16 . Still having the same problem of finishing off stocks but I’m perfectly fine racking up %. What do Fox players even do against Wolf LOL felt so hopeless in that matchup.
4531 2019-03-08 08:35:24 I get ya. I did that yesterday. Protein shake for breakfast then nothing until 8pm when it was burger, chips, mozzarella sticks, nuggets and a pudding.

Should we read anything into that as share price holds steady at R17.00?

And #RFG & #LBR only 2 food stocks no trading update yet?
4539 2019-03-08 08:20:27 Based on the over-reactions we get these days in equity market, it is possible for #SPX to revisit 2650/2600 or below.  But sustained downtrend in equities is not possible due to the lack of any meaningful catalyst. So only mantra to make $$ here is to buy quality stocks on dip

4583 2019-03-08 07:49:31 Weak global cues amid concern over sluggish global growth spoiled investors sentiment. Steep selling of stocks by domestic institutional investors (DIIs) also worried investors. DIIs sold shares worth a net Rs 925.46 crore on Thursday, 7 March 2019, as per provisional data.
4584 2019-03-08 07:48:33 The #uranium sector is basically at a point where all the sellers have sold. 

Should the market tank, I just don't see this segment going down with it, since the only people still holding stocks are true buyers.

Investing - Watch stocks in your investing basket at EOD( end of the day)

You can't watch all 5000 stocks.

4647 2019-03-08 06:59:11 The very idea of an ETF for preferred stocks is ludicrous. Has definitely injected unnecessary volatility into the space.

4651 2019-03-08 06:53:53 Most of that  US$1 trillion came from oil and gas revenues in the first place. If they dump oil and gas stocks and reinvest the proceeds in renewables that would help in spurring technological innovation, green growth and climate change impact mitigation. Not a bad idea.

4658 2019-03-08 06:47:31 But Falco's best combos come off grab and a anti-air uptilt with a huge front hitbox so that's why he's good against heavies. He can also camp them with laser and edge-guard them very easily. Characters with perceptible recoveries are easy to edge-guard can close early stocks
4659 2019-03-08 06:46:55 Chinese stocks slumped the most in nearly five months as traders took a rare sell rating from the nation’s largest brokerage as a sign that the government wants to slow down the rally.
4660 2019-03-08 06:45:29 You can't opt out of owning anything in particular with a @Vanguard_Group IRA. You can compute all holdings of unwanted stocks by all ETFs but they only let you pick from 20 unlisted funds with secret holdings

These are stocks. To make money; don't trade, buy one that's undervalued and hold it. I read somewhere a guy called Buffet does that.

Pump cash in both monthly and use it to buy stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The latter (to me)/is less risky as you have a dedicated fund mgr that manage the MF.

4711 2019-03-08 05:51:27 Also, don't fall for the bad deals in the game.

The best deals that I've had while playing is cheap stocks ($1, $5, $10) that can go up to $30-40 and buying property even if it doesn't cashflow.

Most times I got a chance to profit from selling a duplex, 3b2r, etc.

4719 2019-03-08 05:47:09  yeah ok. High scale fishing is wiping out fish stocks. That’s a fact. It’s got nothing to do with being city folk or not. I’m a fisherman and the argument for commercial fishing is a joke. You want to eat a fish, get off your arse and go an catch it.

4747 2019-03-08 05:17:40 Just so you know, the more you pump the stock the less likely it will go up. All of the past OTC stocks that I've witnessed that frequently provided updates through twitter had a hard time going up, and eventually crashed, regardless of the "good" news.

4752 2019-03-08 05:14:15 Tends to be 60/30 or 50/20, but it depends on the stock. Look for ones with long steady trends. Vary the DTE from 7 to 21. Some 4-digit percentage gain stocks will appear. Losers can show high losses, but the 75-80% success rate more than makes up for it.

4754 2019-03-08 05:13:04 You are correct, but the ruling is Vague about what is to be done with Bump stocks. It is Voluntary Destruction of them.  @Kirstenjoyweiss , I know what you mean though! That Law can be Abused . Easily! Our Group, VCDL is taking it to Court!

4778 2019-03-08 04:59:37 Tonight I felt like I played well but didn’t get what I wanted. Like dying at 49% off my Up B really made me really upset. Going up 2 stocks and bombing as well really killed my mood. I’m making strides, but tonight....it just wasn’t it.

4786 2019-03-08 04:54:14 So it’s not quite that clean.

In these tests, intermediate-to-slow trend equity added significant value vs the 50/50 in the top 6 largest drawdowns.  It was just all the other ones that didn’t pan out.

So it’s one of these, “stocks for the long run on your run” scenarios.

4893 2019-03-08 03:32:37 Their stocks are falling and they probably think this is the answer. They still need to file the actual appeal so maybe with enough backlash from creatives, they won’t follow through. Either way, it’s wrong on every level.

4902 2019-03-08 03:28:15 I have the same analysis. We won’t go near December lows, that environment doesn’t exist anymore. A lot of MSO’s are approaching buying territory with strong support levels. Many stocks went public last fall, and had little volume going into the crash. Much more history now

If I get a choice between a pillory or stocks, I'd prefer the stocks if it's all the same to you. You have to stand in a pillory, but you get to sit in stocks.

4958 2019-03-08 02:47:43 8 years ago, we were coming off a near depression. You do not get over that in a year or two. However, because of what Obama did, I was able to retire to a gated community in south Florida.  He almost tripled the stock market. Trump would have to get stocks to 60,000 to equal it.

5022 2019-03-08 02:01:28 $GTBIF $CURLF $TCNNF $HRVSF $CRLBF $CWBHF $ACRGF $CTST These stocks are all down significantly over the last 10 days. Lack of story momentum, earnings reports, insider share overhang, differentiated strategy are limiting investor confidence.
5023 2019-03-08 02:01:25 This is for all the OTC Hustlers: the ones who trade penny stocks, invest in the underdogs, the ones who grind, the risk takers, the ones who know that nothing comes easy, the ones who are one stock away from life changing money, the ones who wanna flip a penny into dollars.

5028 2019-03-08 01:56:55 IMO stocks will be flat range bound +/- 10% next decade, Global central banks will be pumping QE to eternity and rates <0. In the meantime #Bitcoin >$1 million.
5029 2019-03-08 01:56:02 Every time I hear @BernieSanders and @RepJayapal mention #MedicareForAll, I gleefully imagine  the health insurance stocks losing another 5% in value. 
5030 2019-03-08 01:55:51 Stocks in Asia tracked declines in the U.S. after a European Central Bank cut to economic forecasts reignited concern on global growth and sent bond yields lower.
5031 2019-03-08 01:55:40 The volatility of stocks varies greatly from stock to stock. Crypto is like anything else.

5033 2019-03-08 01:55:11 What happens if there’s a huge move up on large volume on these illiquid stocks?
5034 2019-03-08 01:55:04 Actually, he's taking money out of solar energy. Meaning Al Gore, The Clintons, and The Obama's should sell their stocks. I hope you guys made your money, scamming America, while you enriched yourself by investing in alternative energy.
5035 2019-03-08 01:54:17 @YaelCosset with the drop in Kroger stocks, have you considered hiring a couponer as myself to guide how your stores deal with sales, and transactions?

5041 2019-03-08 01:50:01 I lot of people I see are posting they had red weeks, Happy to say I’m pretty green, change your mind set, don’t be a perma bull/bear .. focus on a handful of stocks and trade those, don’t chase and don’t follow, learn to adapt to what the stock is telling
5042 2019-03-08 01:48:41 For some reason i think trading stocks would get a lot easier if i was in that world and privy to a lot of inside stuff. Also Im sure business opportunities open up that never would have before
5043 2019-03-08 01:47:49 85% of all stocks owned by top 10%. What you pay for in health insurance with your employer combined with your copayments is substantially more than 2.2% tax.
5044 2019-03-08 01:46:53 Of course that number dropped.  That's how economics works.  Because $dig had fixed proportions of revenue going to buybacks, gold, replacing miners, and overhead its economics were worse than regular mining stocks like @Hut8Mining (which is going bankrupt soon).
5045 2019-03-08 01:45:40 Ao you are suggesting same picture can be used for s&p stocks except $COST

5054 2019-03-08 01:39:33 Most of that "boost" went to tax cuts for billionaires, Millionaires, and Corporations buying back stocks.  83% went to the wealthy and the Trump Tax Cut blew up the 2018 federal deficit by $779 Billion...2019's federal deficit is estimated  $984 Billion, due to Trump's Tax Cuts!
5055 2019-03-08 01:39:10 for some reason i don't think the market is going to come apart here, which means there is roughly a 50% chance it will. so that's helpful. #stocks $SPY

5063 2019-03-08 01:35:20 gonna sell my twitch stocks >:D
5064 2019-03-08 01:35:13 It will likely require a 2008/09 type of decline in the next year or so... as stocks *should* continue to materially outperform bonds in an expansion making the required equity downturn greater to go sub 2.
5065 2019-03-08 01:33:49 Le super marché a refait ses stocks.. Mdddrr
5066 2019-03-08 01:33:45 @JonathanWNV please advise when there will be a full recovery of the ground fish stocks in NL - on moratorium now for over 20 years. Yes this was a federal management jurisdiction. We lost 40,000 jobs and many many communities.
5067 2019-03-08 01:33:10 Malaysian stock traders I think should focus more on China, dollar strength, or some emerging markets health instead of focusing entirely on Dow Jones Index. DJI does not correlate with Malaysian stocks at all.
Don't believe me, look past 5 years.
5068 2019-03-08 01:32:54 #PHD Was a great trade 2 days after the P/W then many took their profit. It's lining up for another great trade now but the MMs are playing a blinder tricking traders with size, NTs etc. Why I don't like SEAQ. Half a dozen spivs controlling the price! All stocks should be SETS.
5069 2019-03-08 01:30:20 Awww hell yeah. I like where this is going. I think LJ only knows the frozen foods aisle and the bakery. Oh and perhaps that silly aisle that stocks the crayons.
5070 2019-03-08 01:29:51 Levels done went up in the stocks! Different me, different typa lifestyle!
5071 2019-03-08 01:29:01 I tend to agree! If only we could hand out medication for all the suffering souls freq living on our streets who certainly require something -lithium or whatever? My stocks of late are unlikely to help me make world better esp, my lithium stocks!
5072 2019-03-08 01:27:50 Yes we should expect an 11 yr company to execute like BMW etc. got it. Be a hater I could care less in fact the boat is so loaded up with haters the stocks finally intriguing. Elon needs to step aside. Mldel3 needs a JV scale partner. They need to be SAAS for OEMS etc etc
5073 2019-03-08 01:23:56 So many companies\retailers are mentioned on MSM and I have never heard of them. Then again I am unlikely to have money to spend there. It could be this retailer only stocks women's clothes anyhow.

5092 2019-03-08 01:05:58 Take a look at the Es-nq-rty and ym if you want. I don’t look at the YM much. Rty is the most important US index in my mind. It is 2000 US based stocks with the financials thrown in there. Es has 500 stocks and NQ had 100. All broader indices then ym
5093 2019-03-08 01:05:20 yeah. I am improving my skills to trade biotech stocks now. I have a ton of $FCSC, but it does not budge. Those junk stocks like $ZSAN, $BPTH, $SEEL go wild. It is always so painful: to follow the crowd or not?

Adult Me: A low P/E ratio is low for a reason as future earnings deteriorate or price anticipates that deterioration and it’s also an hyped metric that most people shouldn’t ever use.

5110 2019-03-08 00:52:42 In many universities across the US and the UK even first years are asked to write an essay about how race is a social construct. Not argue whether it is, of course, because that's just assumed to be true a priori.

5117 2019-03-08 00:43:38 I agree!
5118 2019-03-08 00:43:37 $SPY Understand that when stocks/markets correct that support lines are only to guide. The stock/market will determine where support is.

5128 2019-03-08 00:40:34 And yet millions of us “know” they are effective including MDs who have taken care of us but Im seeing quotes “not effective” they know they cannot claim this. The narrative changed for heroin and illegal fentanyl and mm stocks?

5140 2019-03-08 00:28:14 @AskRobinhood do you have certain restrictions on purchasing stocks the same day as their IPO release? If so why? An example would be Shockwave-SWAV.
5141 2019-03-08 00:26:45 I'm in $csrm as well, but it's really not that hard to stay on point of a simple tweet about other stocks that are not $csrm.   It will do fine all on it's own.
5142 2019-03-08 00:26:33 Investments (stocks, precious metals, real estate, bitcoin, altcoin, cryptocurrency, ...) you make are so shaky. It takes a moment of lack of interest for the markets to plummet like there is no tomorrow. Everyone should #justparkincash, then we will all very easily profit.

5144 2019-03-08 00:23:48 Lol not helpful :)
Do u recommend any stocks to buy now
5145 2019-03-08 00:21:27 I get to choose my own stocks with this one
5146 2019-03-08 00:20:55 So apparently you get a lesser sentence if you lie in your plea deal
5147 2019-03-08 00:19:27 @Wealthsimple is there a way we can request socks be made available on Wealthsimple Trade? That's the only thing holding me back from using it to buy right now as it's missing the couple stocks I'm interested in.

5149 2019-03-08 00:16:25 @timseymour @karenfinerman @grassosteve So the worlds richest consumers with a wicked strong currency now get to book their European and Latam travel and get a shit Ton of value per buck and that’s bad? Low rates as far as eye can see pushes huge $$ out of bonds and into stocks
5150 2019-03-08 00:16:15 Stocks on our radar for 3/8:
DIN: Band Value +22.21%; current price 20.00% above avg
SCWX: Band Value +36.86%; current price 32.20% above avg
SFLY: Band Value -38.81%; current price 39.66% below avg
ZEN: Band Value +29.67%; current price 27.23% above avg
5151 2019-03-08 00:16:05 That call happened because stocks were crashing, but it doesn't mean it caused them to rally. The Fed played a part. Also stocks shouldn't have been crashing that much in the first place.
5152 2019-03-08 00:12:53 I don't really understand what is being explicitly or implicitly suggested here. It's a ratio. So if the relative returns fell back to historical levels in the next downturn, doesn't that say something about both stocks AND 30yrs?
5153 2019-03-08 00:12:38 Who into stocks?
5154 2019-03-08 00:12:03 We can send some...while stocks last!
5155 2019-03-08 00:11:00 Vanguard is competing with almost 0% expense ratios.  The cost of investment advice is on a hard trend to zero.

5157 2019-03-08 00:08:44 .@Publix we have purchased at Store 588 for 30 years. All of the sudden out of stocks are common. Today, no Breakstone in 8 oz, no vanilla pudding “Jello”. (Deli & meats are OK). Go check your store #238, my wife is traveling extra mile now. More important, 2 competitors, thread
5158 2019-03-08 00:06:55 Los stocks...el problema son los stocks...
5159 2019-03-08 00:06:10 Not saying it will stay there--which is a separate debate and I am not so sanguine about the fairly fast rebound as you are. All I am saying is that it can come down to those levels fairly easily. 30% drop in stocks and 30% rise in bonds does it.
5160 2019-03-08 00:05:21 Kumpleto na stocks natin sa kutkutin
Except choco rock pala! US nuts meron na rin! Order na
5161 2019-03-08 00:04:54 Dami pa daw stocks ng MAC , di pa nauubos. Bili ka naman pra ma sold out na.
5162 2019-03-08 00:04:02 Stop trolling and do some reading. You’re showing your ignorance. Congress did not pass a law banning bump stocks! It was an edict by the ATF, an appointed (not elected) regulatory agency. Don’t forget there are others who not only disagree with you, they think your’re an idiot!
5163 2019-03-08 00:01:11 First News 8 March 2019 - US stocks lower for a 4th session, PSEi +0.77% to 7881 (16.4x), AC, FB, SMC, WLCON, TEL, ICT SMPH, EAGLE, DMC, DBM - Budget, Foreign Reserves
