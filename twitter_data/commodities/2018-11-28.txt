3 2018-11-28 23:49:08 We can agree to disagree on that. Considering how marginal the project is I think there is no certainty it gets funded. Even if it does get funded, nickel and cobalt prices need to be high for it to be profitable. Commodities are cyclical and a 13 year offtake is a long time.
4 2018-11-28 23:42:28 Shavers promised a return. We are talking about self trading commodities. My question is rather simple: If someone in the middle east buys and sells oil to themselves, can they be prosecuted under US law? Is there ever a single case?

6 2018-11-28 23:26:30 The players aren’t human to them either. They’re commodities. This will never end until accountability and consequences become as important as money. They’ll protect anyone who is making (or has the potential to make) them money. It’s disgusting.

33 2018-11-28 21:59:07 The philosophy that lies behind Neoliberalism,We have to put a price on things. Even though they’re not really things that should be treated as commodities. 
Health care becomes a commodity. Housing for everybody becomes a commodity. Education becomes a commodity.
34 2018-11-28 21:52:14 $SPY dollar rally has officially come to an end. Stocks bullish near term. Begin loading commodities systematically.
35 2018-11-28 21:46:24 Y no es que en 2011 estábamos súper. Sólo habíamos recuperado la caída al abismo del 2001. O sea q estamos igual que en 2001! Habiendo tenido un período de precios de commodities irrepetible. Espero q la propuesta liberal incluya tb juicio x mala praxis a los gobiernos!

37 2018-11-28 21:21:00 #Ecommerce
Commodities and basic/everyday consumer goods, purchases which are easily reordered and replenished, are ripe for auto-replenishment features; milk, lightbulbs, batteries, printer paper, coffee. These goods will actually be easier to replenish without a browser.
38 2018-11-28 21:13:45 A7 A deficit of compassionate communities results in increased dissonance for individuals. Often compounded by institutional, cultural or structural abuse. Resolution, restoration and resonant stability r priceless commodities sadly traded by vested interests for short-term gain.
39 2018-11-28 21:13:31 Luis, no comparto que los bancos especulen en mercados de commodities, además poco líquidos.
40 2018-11-28 21:12:57 Justin, I doubt there will be the corresponding commodities upturn table.
Good news does n't sell newspapers.
41 2018-11-28 21:07:30 Don’t see how a jawbone does anything to be honest lol esp for fins and tech. To your point they’re looking to get commodities back up to put a floor on prices and stimulate demand but that’s not working. sentiment way out of line here imo

43 2018-11-28 21:04:38 His statement seemed correct. FR policy is approaching neutrality. (Trump acts and speaks as if it is tight!). Markets will occasionally over-react.  The bond is little changed today. Equities, bitcoin, and commodities bounced. They are right to be concerned about inflation
44 2018-11-28 21:04:04 I'm also not a big fan of commodities. I don’t recommend commodities or commodity produces like Gold miners / Oil drillers as real assets (unless you're a great trader). Furthermore, futures are actually very costly to hold even when in a bull market.
45 2018-11-28 21:04:01 There is really no reason to short this type of move. Institutional sellers will not fade that today.  But Oil, Commodities, and everything that should believe the Chairman did not.  I don't see a sell yet.  I do want some very long term shorts (1 year +) so I will grab higher
46 2018-11-28 21:03:16 This is because the secret behind exchange-value is the equality of all human labors, but this secret can only be revealed in capitalist society, because it is only in capitalist society that products generally assume the form of commodities.
47 2018-11-28 21:02:16 Aristotle understands the first peculiarity of the equivalent-form: that there is a value that the two commodities possess in common. But unlike Marx, Aristotle could not determine anything about the nature of this value (the 2nd and 3rd peculiarities of the equivalent form).
48 2018-11-28 21:00:57 I don't know the answer. It depends on the outcome - in a deflationary bust and in a hyperinflation, physical gold is the safest harbor. In a stagflation or simply higher inflation w/out a bust, a basket of commodities should hold its own.
49 2018-11-28 20:56:36 #palladium,#Copper, & #oats. Big winners today.

50 2018-11-28 20:55:20 Are they doing this through ETF's (2x-3x levered), or through the physical commodities?  If this is behind these moves, it is lunacy!
51 2018-11-28 20:54:18 Over the next few years, do you think the dollar loses its purchasing power vs a basket of commodities?  Or just gold?
52 2018-11-28 20:52:25 To me it's another clue on the state's ability to choose winners & losers as the war on commodities continues. Actually amazing that they can quarantine oil while we watch the DOW soar +605 points. Fingerprints of the PPT.
53 2018-11-28 20:36:30 7) A simple mat: At the present time more than 3 billion people, who live under poverty line) are excluded from the market. They cannot buy any goods & commodities. By full development & involvement of AI & Automation, which will happen in the next decade & beyond, the  #Uber
54 2018-11-28 20:33:38 KB is ignoring the fact that China's non-commodity goods trade surplus is $700B, per IIF.  I suspect he's ignoring it for good reason - if China can price commodities in CNY (see CNY oil contract), then China will not have a BoP problem for a long, long time.
55 2018-11-28 20:31:03 Yes indeed- all markets from crypto to equities to commodities have caused many losses
56 2018-11-28 20:29:14 Only if there is a need for a product then it will be bought, but at its lowest price. Then production costs matter. #commodities
57 2018-11-28 20:24:43 Do not pay back if you receive this money it's your intitlement you are suppose to be receiving some money from govt when you are jobless or they give you vauch for purchasing basic commodities.
58 2018-11-28 20:23:33 thanks Ondrej! I do have ports in the game which allow you to buy ships/upgrades and sell commodities that you find, which needs more fleshing out but is kind of a trading mechanic
59 2018-11-28 20:20:32 Seems there were lots of girls who did the recruitment. Likely hundreds of underage girls molested or raped by this one man. Absolutely sickening. And authorities covered it up. Girls and women have been mistreated and treated as commodities for ages and it needs to be stopped.
60 2018-11-28 20:20:03 And civil servants would be paid in?
Basic commodities will be manufactured here or outside the country??
This is not simple?

61 2018-11-28 20:06:52 What will limit a tax on the private sale of regular household or recreational commodities? Would we tax garage sales? However, allowing women who did not want their photos posted online to have copyright and tax implications could be beneficial and costly to websites.
62 2018-11-28 20:04:25 Yo fuck off if you buy exotic animals as pets. They are not commodities for you to flex. They are animals and deserve to live their normal life.
63 2018-11-28 20:03:55 For me, it is about the emotional hooks - the limited colour palette suggesting old books, the renaissance themeing, the use of nobles/royalty/class, established commodities like silk, wood, ore.
64 2018-11-28 19:57:24 In Connecticut, a mother with two children participating in seven major welfare programs (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Medicaid, food stamps, WIC, housing assistance, utility assistance and free commodities) could receive a package of benefits worth $38,761,
65 2018-11-28 19:52:44 Indeed it's their need of hour can't help even. Till the time they are with SALE tag they can't compete with RoW. It's happening with them in other commodities too. It's what India has done in past.
66 2018-11-28 19:51:27 $BTC futures to be launched on the Nasdaq = Shows it is a commodity. Commodities are trades as futures.

MOST crypto are commodities, as they are often utility tokens or whatever. How do you think this will be played out?

Pay with $XRP (a currency) for these digital commodities!
67 2018-11-28 19:50:29 That's actually backwards lol it's not men or womans fault its media. Kids have been learning what they know about sex from porn and music for the past 20yrs. That woman are objects of pleasure and commodities not people. U live what u learn. Ps all "Jobs" are supposed to pay tax
68 2018-11-28 19:49:37 we already have plenty of warnings signs imo.  LQD:IEF topped in Jan, SPX's unchanged 2018, 10's less 2's inverts if Powell does hike, Commodities everywhere crushed, PG trouncing AAPL. Tells us future macro uncertain based on participants behavior in the present.
69 2018-11-28 19:47:51 1) Another thing 2 help reduce warming climates is 2plant more trees!!!Also let private companies clean up r forests. We can create products from all recycleable materials rather than giving r trash commodities 2 China. Much of which they no longer want. Why rnt we creating jobs?
70 2018-11-28 19:45:39 I guess reading between the lines that farmers are facing an abundance of commodities which have been grown in a higher CO2 atmosphere; supply and demand basic economics, higher supply lower prices
71 2018-11-28 19:45:15 It's actually worse than that. Problem solving skills are not highly valued commodities in the school district. Weak leaders surround themselves with weak followers. People with real skills don't last very long in the district, or learn to keep a low profile.
72 2018-11-28 19:40:08 Low CI / GHG commodities - Co, Li, U, V
73 2018-11-28 19:37:27 We have xenor gear and equipment; emergency rations and commodities; and spare uniforms, too. It's a bit cramped, though - just two bedrooms, plus living, dining, and kitchen.
74 2018-11-28 19:37:25 I'm not a big fan of commodities. Commodities don't usually go up during bear markets and recessions, unless there is very high inflation of course
75 2018-11-28 19:34:24 I like this game: Farage was a third-rate commodities trader, who failed to be elected as an MP SEVEN TIMES. He's not respected at all.

79 2018-11-28 19:24:19 2.  Food prices may even drop, and there is room for some inflation. Oil and many commodities are not necessarily tied to EU. So , to be fair is possibly a half truth.  N.B note all the usage of  words like ‘could’ ....’may’....If.  In nearly all PROJECT FEAR stories.

82 2018-11-28 19:10:49 Beware of averages. The most affected will be the lower income families.Loss of manufacturing and retail jobs.Higher food &essential commodities prices (+ possible increase of VAT to compensate for loss of tax income). Reduction in benefits. The poorest will suffer the most.

86 2018-11-28 18:59:06 That’s what market forces do to commodities. Not governments.
87 2018-11-28 18:56:39 Dubai used funds largely accrued from a 15-year "commodities super cycle" that started in 1999 thereabouts. What did we do with our own revenue? We spend recklessly - as if it would last forever - and then lament. Then next cycle we repeat all over again, blaming everyone else.
88 2018-11-28 18:52:09 I think state owned oil companies should not exist for profit, neither should my greedy government be taxing the hell out of commodities like fuel.
89 2018-11-28 18:43:31 Grains/oilseeds find buyer interest ahead of the weekend G20 and US-China talks. Today's Fed talk and stock market may be viewed as supportive of commodities. However, crude oil moved to record supplies.
90 2018-11-28 18:39:29 Keep an eye on Commodities and emerging markets. IF the dollar continues to weaken this could be the big winner. There is not a soul who owns these and they can have a massive move. no position yet
91 2018-11-28 18:37:30 “O Brasil é um dos maiores exportadores de commodities agrícolas — vendas que representaram 23,5% do PIB nacional em 2017”.
92 2018-11-28 18:37:08 You could sector diversify in other commodities.  The ones I'm attracted to at the moment are oil, copper, and especially uranium.

98 2018-11-28 18:23:48 Sim, por meio da Vale, eles estupram a maior província mineral do planeta. (Pará). Compram nossas commodities a preço de banana e estocam na China esperando uma alta de preços. E pela Lei Kandhir (aquele tucano filho da puta) a gente perde muito dos royalties.
99 2018-11-28 18:18:02 Right. Understood. Think commodities go bid from here. As you pointed out may be we are on course to see an inflations spike.
100 2018-11-28 18:04:19 We should always reserve the right to use tariffs. I don’t necessarily have a problem with American companies such as automakers manufacturing overseas, I have a problem with plants here shutting down and importing those commodities. I'd like my electronic devices made here.

103 2018-11-28 17:53:11 broad indices are taking off and $CGC is making a move to break resistance at the 20dma and using the 50dma as support. It has been consolidating for the past 10 days. Looking at commodities for an entry.
104 2018-11-28 17:50:05 Honestly my best trades came as a naked position leveraged with no stop over the weekend in commodities. No fucks given.

106 2018-11-28 17:47:54 Much like #farming industry standards, these mean nothing. @RSPCA_official is always skirting around the issues of abuse and neglect of animals who are treated as commodities because they worry about offending (stupid) people #animalrights

110 2018-11-28 17:39:23 Integrity and respect are the rarest commodities to mankind
111 2018-11-28 17:38:41 I fully agree with your comment. Saudi Arabia is a beneficial country and follows the principles of Islam. The world should be grateful for their help and commodities but recent events have shown us this is sadly not the case.
112 2018-11-28 17:38:05 Vets may be our responsibility but sending them to kill & die is the responsibility of politicians We're bombing 7 countries & that's 100% our responsibility but healthcare & education are frivolous commodities only available to those with means? As a Christian I disagree.
113 2018-11-28 17:33:11 Perhaps you should ask Ms. Barra about that. Trucks & SUVs are hot commodities because more Americans carry more stuff & more kids. We have to haul off trash, carry limber to build, carry wood for our fireplaces, carry crops to market - oh...you messed that one up. #bigbaby
114 2018-11-28 17:20:39 $ flowing into commodities could be mis-leading if it's led by short-covering as was the case Tuesday. Corn and beans rallied, open interest declined.  Buying yes, but on $ exiting.
115 2018-11-28 17:16:46 Seria verdade se o PT fosse um partido de esquerda! O PT é um partido de centro-esquerda que não teve coragem de reformar e muito menos revolucionar! O PT apenas surfou a onda conjuntural (demanda chinesa por commodities) e está pagando caro por achar que era amado pela elite!
116 2018-11-28 17:15:33 The funny thing about respect is, it is one of the few commodities you actually have to earn. This president craves respect and admiration, constantly heaping it on himself when no one else will. I remember Reagan. Trump is no Reagan. I also remember Bozo the clown. That he is.
117 2018-11-28 17:12:14 Fund managers love Fed Chair Powell's comments - seeing them as dovish leaning; Money flowing into stocks & commodities & dollar sinking. corn up 4, beans up 16, wheat up 2, KC up 8, DJIA up 400+ points #oatt
118 2018-11-28 17:06:33 A downside turn in the US Dollar here is a big deal and has longer-term implications that will be very supportive to commodities. This will be a long-term trend change.
119 2018-11-28 17:06:08 Tras declaraciones del presidente de la Fed, es esperable un debilitamiento del dólar, repunte de los commodities y recuperación de las bolsas

123 2018-11-28 16:49:16 What has the dollar's hegemony done for the world? If an SDR based on a basket of currencies and commodities came into being, would that be so bad? (And Putin is a nationalist, not a globalist.)
124 2018-11-28 16:48:51 @XRPTrump you are a smart man. galgitron is correct on this one issue. I'm an economist in my day job and I spend countless hours adjusting forecasted price on commodities when AVAILABLE supply changes.  Price does not change until and unless available supply changes.
125 2018-11-28 16:45:31 NO ONE is denied healthcare in this country. Understanding the difference between rights & commodities is important. Healthcare is a right, but top tier insurance is a commodity. If you want the extras you have to pay for it. Just like with everything else. Providers are a bus.
126 2018-11-28 16:40:32 Velho, commodities são carne de vaca. Qualquer um tem pra vender. E Nióbio, grande coisa, pode ser substituído por outro elemento.
127 2018-11-28 16:38:39 You have to see when they bought the commodities. If they imported something with 15K exchange rate, they would naturally try to sell it at the minimum at the same rate. Unless they can't sell at that price, forcing them to bring the price down to match the mark rate!
128 2018-11-28 16:36:23 I would like to know what Alberta is going to diversify its economy? It’s by no means easy or clean work and the workers who do it deserve to be compensated well but why would you tie 50% of your economic output to commodities whose prices are dictated internationally?

130 2018-11-28 16:25:48 This action in commodities is perfectly normal for an economic meltdown. The only thing abnormal is gold. Don't blame the Fed/Treasury for that, blame the cult of degenerate speculators/gamblers who have been shorting gold for 7 years and discouraged investors to return.
131 2018-11-28 16:25:32 Markets are controlled, consumer goods and commodities are price controlled and rationed, land redistributed, industries (not just oil) nationalized... It may be unfair to equivocate DS proposed by Bernie & AOC /w Venezuela, but it's absurd to Venezuela was capitalist
132 2018-11-28 16:23:03 Change in deed. Killing of soldiers and increase in prices of commodities. Petroleum and diesel unavoidable

136 2018-11-28 16:18:32 Yes, industry is very good at taking shit that's already been done and doing it to make money, I get it, but industry has also monopolized commodities

But I thought we were talking about the development of technology, not the exploitation of resources.
137 2018-11-28 16:12:51 This is one of many desperate attempts by Fed to drive money into Treasuries to get rates down. Wait/What? Yep, nobody wants to buy US debt so we have resorted to price fixing commodities with HFT & causing chaos both here & abroad. Fed's biggest fear is a real economic recovery.
138 2018-11-28 16:10:06 What policies are in place to regulate Raw Material outflow compared to value added commodities in Agricuture, Kenya buys Grain, not flour inorder to protect their SME's dealing in the same yet we import maize flour from Kenya.  @ntvuganda #NTVSummit18
139 2018-11-28 16:04:57 This is particularly the case for agricultural commodities, which have a much more complex role in the carbon cycle. I'm aware of macro-scale footprint analyses which tend to favour industrially-produced global market goods simply because of methodological choices...
140 2018-11-28 16:02:01 I pity many of the "young" people on this street campaigning for PMB for another term. They need to get home and ask Mummy and Daddy about the days of "Essential Commodities" in Nigeria. I pray we will not experience it again (if we vote wisely).
141 2018-11-28 15:59:11 Don’t pair your limited commodities with a shitty contract. It gives us nothing in return. Why don’t they swap a bad contract with a shorter term. I.E. Ellsbury and then add like 20m on top of that? We could then trade the other guys for actual products and have a chance in 2022

147 2018-11-28 15:38:45 Lógico nós continuar exportando commodities e continuamos sendo um país subdesenvolvidos ridículo sem econômia forte.

149 2018-11-28 15:31:23 Not sure what makes anyone think they can predict Donald Trump.  A semi-real resolution should be good for a rally given the many large sectors impacted (commodities, autos, tech/semis, leisure/gaming)
150 2018-11-28 15:27:37 I’m in the international tradable commodities industry, the FUT market is easy to read and tremendously repetitive, relative to what I do in my normal job. Forecasting isn’t overly complicated as we even get live feedback during games.

152 2018-11-28 15:18:11 Thanks to crazy Trump tariffs, the economy is starting a huge tailspin--lost sales in steel & commodities.  Tons of new jobs paying $9 an hour or less--Trump wages--I mean Chump wages. No one can live on that type of income--no benefits either.

155 2018-11-28 15:08:43 In under a decade we saw the price point of oil which kills demand and the price point which kills supply. Commodities prices don't operate in a silo. They impact consumer habits. Seriously I want to see that diploma from Wharton.
156 2018-11-28 15:08:34 This is getting out of hand. There is a reason Syndergaard is available. I don’t get why anyone would think Hedges is worth so little that we would have to give a blue chip with an MLB outfielder. Good catchers are one of the most valuable commodities in baseball.

159 2018-11-28 15:05:46 Does this guy understand anything about the impact of commodities on the border market?  If fuel prices went to 4.50 small truck demand would plummet and car demand would rise. We saw this play out perfectly during the summer of 2008! The facts don't lie. Chicken tax...PLEASE!

165 2018-11-28 14:49:26 People in Uzumba and the rest of Zim don't eat the narrowing budget deficit. People want affordable basic commodities, good healthcare, jobs and a stable currency. Economics jargon belong to the lecture room.

167 2018-11-28 14:44:15 This would encourage smuggling and hike in the market prices of these commodities-which a lot of Nigerians depend on as business for their well being.Our government has not provided the template and biz environment for local content,so this move is anti-trade!

174 2018-11-28 14:31:24 I was just curious because his idea was right, but the antics behind it was wrong. Had he partnered up with Nike or Adidas and Lonzo played better, he would have been sitting on a gold mine. Kind of what Lebron is doing with his productions. Same thing different commodities.
175 2018-11-28 14:30:51 A problem in a lot crypto asset funds is that they display fake diversity!

 If you can break crypto assets into classes of at least: digital commodities, digital currencies, and stakes in DApps then a diversified crypto asset portfolio should allocate to all 3. NOT just 1.

180 2018-11-28 14:20:35 Jared given your focus on inequality, it's useful to consider that loose Fed policy is a driver of inequalty through asset price increases (stocks, housing, commodities), helping debtors over savers, &bigger finance industry.

197 2018-11-28 13:49:27 Possible, but I persoanlly think the manipulation is brought on because of it being a lower liquidity market. Forex and Commodities markets are not swayed by one person trading a large amount of money.

223 2018-11-28 12:17:54 And inflation is not happening. Deflation is happening right now sir. Commodities are taking their Plunge, layoffs are beginning to occur (mostly due to poor planning on Management's part) and wages are not under any kind of real pressure to go up.

226 2018-11-28 11:57:17 I said then, why should I read a book just because it's written to YOUR reading level.

Globalism promotes a"global economy" b/c it provides cheap labor & commodities for those able to afford it. It fails to help people in local economies have jobs.

229 2018-11-28 11:45:00 It's probably because cars these days are commodities & sold/leased as that. They are soulless lumps of metal and plastic designed by committee, computer & wind tunnel. Years ago they were designed by heart, hand & nature.
230 2018-11-28 11:38:30 That's a nice piece. Interesting and very relevant in the sense that people aren't engaging with cars like they used to. Sadly they are becoming commodities

236 2018-11-28 11:16:17 So fiat money generated at the whim of the government is a custodian? Sounds more like a reciepe for disaster. As for basing it off of commodities or even GDP I could go along with but it needs some intrinsic value  or just pretty paper that they tell you is worth something.
237 2018-11-28 11:08:55 We need food on the table first and money in the banks,pple are now suffocating with hunger due to the exorbitant prices of basic commodities.Budget deficit nonsense lets focus on it later,the rambai makashinga mantra has got no room in this country anymore!
238 2018-11-28 11:07:05 Sex and love are not human rights such as freedom of belief and dignity. Neither are they commodities whose supply can  be regulated by the state. Sex and love cannot be "demanded" from others.  That's the language of abusive, coercive control.
239 2018-11-28 11:06:16 which part do you hate? The part where we insist that people pull their own weight or how we think for ourselves?  Oh I know, its how we don't treat others like commodities. That really pisses off the democrats aka party of everlasting slavery

244 2018-11-28 10:02:05 I agree. Even the commodities futures market that farmers use as a hedge against inflation. If the person on the other side of that trade doesn’t sign a contract, how do you know they’ll deliver? So even in non-debt situations, contracts are essential for business operations.
245 2018-11-28 10:00:32 I know how the commodity market works Edwin. So you are saying in those 12months we will have deals on all of those commodities in place at as good or a more preferable rate than now? Is that an assurance you are willing to give NI farmers and your constituents now?
246 2018-11-28 09:55:35 Now is the time to buy junior mining shares.  Absolutely silly low valuations on a whole host of situations, companies, and commodities. Buy low and sell high-- and now it's ultra low.

259 2018-11-28 08:11:16 RT ErikVoorhees: Tokens reduce transaction costs. Just as paper warehouse receipts expanded markets by increasing liquidity for commodities in the 19th century, so too will tokens expand markets by reducing the transactional friction of anything attached to them.
260 2018-11-28 08:06:08 Does the new Treasury Report factor in the negative & economically destructive data inputs relating to very high EU import tariffs on basic foodstuffs & commodities? Ordinary consumers pay these grossly inflated EU charges that feed through to reduced economic performance

266 2018-11-28 07:29:21 The core of adversities Africa faces are economic. Economic productivity in the continent is up to 20times less than that of developed regions. This is primarily due to lack of value addition to commodities for which the region holds a comparative advantage.

268 2018-11-28 07:25:38 A Treasury report that predictably forecasts UK economic decline outside the wonderful EU, probably failed to explain how sky-high EU tariff impositions mean UK consumers pay the world’s highest prices for basic food & necessary commodities.

286 2018-11-28 05:30:57 US all set for another interest rate hike when the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meets in December. This would result in a stronger U.S dollar which would make commodities more expensive for other countries to buy. This would lead to a fall in oil prices due to low demand.

336 2018-11-28 01:32:34 "Objects that in themselves have no commodities, such as conscience, honour, etc., are capable of being offered for sale by their holders, and of thus acquiring, through their price, the form of commodities. Hence an object may have a price without a value."
337 2018-11-28 01:19:38 it's clear you fell from the stupid tree, but was there truly no way for you to avoid all the branches on the way down? what qualifies the value of money (again, the commodity to which all commodities are compared) if not state enforcement and violence???
338 2018-11-28 00:54:07 Anyone remember commodities from years ago. Families got the food they needed delivered to them. Basics. Bet a lot of lazy a&& people would go to work if we went back to commodities.
339 2018-11-28 00:43:47 Amigo, o boom das commodities é um fenômeno que não atingiu só o Brasil. O que o PT deveria fazer? Encerrar todos os contratos comerciais? O monopólio dos bancos sempre existiu, não foi o PT que criou. O financiamento aos grandes ainda existe. O PT não é uma olha não.
