7 2018-10-16 23:54:29 This has nothing to do with politics and everything to do with Natural Resources Partners L.P.. There is nothing the almighty Ojeda can do to change this. Yes it sucks. NRP is struggling, stocks are dropping like a rock. Just look at their earnings report.

37 2018-10-16 23:45:19 This is legitimately the answer. I've seen improvement in myself after reframing being down stocks/games from "There's no way I can make up for this deficit" into "Now I just have to make the comeback"

51 2018-10-16 23:38:50 I feel bad for all the people getting the shake down on pot stocks. Everyone saying they’re all going to crash are either shorting or just dummies.
52 2018-10-16 23:38:17 Best laugh of the day!  I hope so. Buying stocks in popcorn!

57 2018-10-16 23:35:39 I wonder if @cnbc realizes that "CNBC itself" is as responsible as anything else for the recent decline in pot stocks. CNBC moves stocks, there's been a barrage of negative commentary lately, they've literally been talked down.   @jimcramer @timseymour @CNBCFastMoney @GuyAdami
58 2018-10-16 23:35:36 thanks a bunch! I trade everything, day trade, swing trade. The insider setups tend to be good swing candidates. GDX and gold stocks were swing trades. Pay attention to the daily charts and not so much the 15 and 60 min charts
59 2018-10-16 23:34:47 Just seems like cannabis is too volatile, requiring a 10% + stop to stay in and if the party ends your screwed. reminds me of cellphone stocks in the 2000 era.
60 2018-10-16 23:34:07 Good day for milk stocks.
61 2018-10-16 23:34:01 As a student of history you realize that at the end of WWII the United States had the #1 Military, 3/4's of the worlds Manufacturing, 2/3rds of worlds gold stocks, and was the #1 creditor.  From there to here.  Our politicians sold us out. That's what this is all about.

65 2018-10-16 23:31:15 Global stocks are probably at or near an all-time high both looking backward AND looking forward.  No one can admit this because all the debt is financed on the assumption of perpetual growth.

68 2018-10-16 23:28:54 Can we get bid/ask on stocks/options BEFORE we BUY them? Perhaps L2 wouldn't hurt either  other than that, pretty pleased. 
69 2018-10-16 23:27:39 Also, just want to say thank you for your contribution to this space Craig. I’ve never been so interested in the markets before. Weather it’s crypto, forex, stocks, I’m excited to learn each day. Happy to ride this wild crypto wave with you.

83 2018-10-16 23:21:49 Agreed, and I myself have done so also. That being said, I still take little weight from calls from mike.

Not trading, just observing, but pot stocks are legal today in Canada. Have you been observing these crypto like pumps? Any thoughts?
84 2018-10-16 23:21:31 Only thing I’m excited about tomorrow is for my weed stocks to keep BOOMin
85 2018-10-16 23:21:13 I made a terrible mistake and forgot to include Concept moderator @powpow_stocks in my tweet yesterday. 

Wouldn’t be Concept Trading without him.
86 2018-10-16 23:19:25 SI, va a costar mucho para que haya suba importante por caída de producción. Con expectativas (hasta hace 10 días) de 127 mill tn de producción, PERO, por sobretodo, con stocks finales que serían el doble del ciclo pasado y el triple de hace 2 campañas.  Pero.. a seguir de cerca
87 2018-10-16 23:19:13 I agree unlikely to hold but I have seen booms and busts on the market and individual stocks on both big and small volume. People always say it matters I just don’t see it. Thanks

89 2018-10-16 23:18:51 Terrible luck and or timing with pot stocks, had CGC once at 29, got stopped out, had Cron last week, same thing, party's over anyhow.
90 2018-10-16 23:18:18 Safe to say any #weedstock that is fortunate enough to have a price target associated with it will be making some BIG MOVES tomorrow.  Huge consolidation day as a whole for these stocks, and MMs were furiously trying to shake people out today.  We will reap the rewards tomorrow.
91 2018-10-16 23:17:55 So tomorrow pot will go from the black market to big corporations. Judging by the projected pricing, the black market will stay alive and well.  Sell your pot stocks people.
92 2018-10-16 23:17:22 Hiromi, lives on Mahogany Drive with wife and 2 kids.

Put all their savings into habanero stocks. Can't retire.
93 2018-10-16 23:16:57 @GOP it amazes me that you have so much anger about someone being killed in another country but your own fucking people can go out and mow down mass amounts of people and you don't give enough of a shit to regulate guns or even bump stocks. YOU ALL MAKE ME SICK AS FUCK!
94 2018-10-16 23:16:43 I don't short stocks.  Don't know much about it. Good luck
95 2018-10-16 23:16:25 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your EDS
96 2018-10-16 23:16:15 Seriously? How is asbestos going to help anyone except morgues? Or mercury contamination - that's expensive to clean up. He's done very little economically - the one item he could point to is "tax reform", which blows up the deficit so corporations can buy back stocks.
97 2018-10-16 23:13:59 Phew! I just bought some too! Stocks, that is!
98 2018-10-16 23:13:42 I swear there wasn't a single person selling stocks today.. Literally all buys on low volume.. Would tell me that it keeps going but who the F knows..
99 2018-10-16 23:13:29 With this level of debt, If interest rates were EVER to reach even one-half of the levels we saw in the 80's and 90's, we would have to toss everything in the dumpster and start over.  I certainly wouldn't want to be holding stocks or government bonds.
100 2018-10-16 23:13:27 Anyone have good advice for people just starting to get into stocks? #money #stocks
101 2018-10-16 23:13:01 My tweets hav the power to drop corporate stocks by 100s of points. Fr tho you should sell. The boost from fifa is gonna end and they're  doing some fuck shit with 2k that will bite them in the ass if there is justice in this world.

105 2018-10-16 23:10:17 Bonds with higher yields compete with stocks? Not really

Low interest bonds sell off and it is not smart to jump into bonds at all before the peak in interest is reached unless you don’t mind loosing valuation. US bond compete with EM bonds that’s all
106 2018-10-16 23:10:01 Joe Cunningham says he is against bump stocks but supports Second Amendment.

107 2018-10-16 23:08:50 Cunningham says there's no need for bump stocks & will fight for "common sense legislation"; also said he's a gun owner, has his CWP & supports 2nd amendment #scpol #chsnews @JournalScene
108 2018-10-16 23:06:54 @CNBCFastMoney Epert on pot stocks, not so impressive.
On Miracle Grow stock as alternate to #pot stocks.
It's expensive, produces undesired smoke, smaller growers expediting process.
Larger growers formulated fertilizer different outcomes specific results.
109 2018-10-16 23:06:07 I only read the finance section to check on my stocks and money things. Also my face is always red Darren I have a blood circulation problem.
110 2018-10-16 23:05:32 After the massacre this morning which could be stemmed from stop losses and people locking in profits. It was a pretty average day for pot stocks. Pot stocks never like 1% days...either way, up or down
111 2018-10-16 23:04:48 Is this compensation with stocks in lieu of paying TTSA staff a salary? Who exactly is receiving the “Stock-Based Compensation"? Shareholders, staff or both?
112 2018-10-16 23:03:03 Where do you trade stocks at bro? Curious as your analysis and TA has been so on point for such a long time it's insane. Keep up the great work man such a fan of it
113 2018-10-16 23:02:27 @DougKass Marijuana goes legal in Canada tomorrow. Risk/reward in pot stocks is all over the map. Can't get a clear readout on it. Am long $ACBFF.
114 2018-10-16 23:02:20 That is exactly what i meant.
In essence stocks reflect psychological aspects and less real hard economic data.
115 2018-10-16 23:01:08 Good morning from @BloombergTV

116 2018-10-16 23:00:33 @MattBadialiGuru Matt...Please tell me if there is a way to buy HEXO without paying the $70.00 foreign exchange fee.  Why is this charged and other Canadian stocks do not charge it?
117 2018-10-16 22:59:53 I can't wait to see how this Twilio deal pans out... Stocks finna be flying right now.
118 2018-10-16 22:59:27 How about you team up with @BKBrianKelly aka #TheCryptoKing for a segment where he talks about $BTC and you talk about weed stocks and the headline could be called “The Bubble Boys: We Are Purely Speculating!” That would at least be somewhat accurate...
119 2018-10-16 22:59:26 The negative sentiment before #earnings on a growth company like $NFLX is a gift.... lowered expectations, stocks that tanked.... #BUY
120 2018-10-16 22:58:56 I mean, you can KO some of them, so having stocks to show which ones you defeated is useful. Also, we don't really know if they will have stocks in the final release... and if they don't have, well... this is how they could have looked like
121 2018-10-16 22:58:47 My stocks are thriving!  shoutout to @netflix 
122 2018-10-16 22:57:52 $NFLX sets for good China stocks rally which will help $IQ & $HUYA in US bourses tomorrow. All techs & FANG get tailwind too. $ZUO $CRM
123 2018-10-16 22:56:16 >> The main difference is that cryptocurrencies and crypto exchanges are not regulated; therefore, that kind of  scam (which is jail matter when done with real stocks) is perfectly legal.
124 2018-10-16 22:55:44 Oil stocks will crash in this weekend. Not exactly.　　石油株は今週末に暴落するだろう。いや、そうでもないよ。
125 2018-10-16 22:55:36 exact! l'an dernier, après une conférence en décembre j'ai même voulu en ramener à ma famille pour les fêtes mais les stocks semblaient épuisés :)
126 2018-10-16 22:55:15 If you think the only way to keep your partner is with money/gifts , then you need to scrap the whole relationship and invest into stocks or something
127 2018-10-16 22:55:12 Yea that’s not true at all, I’ve made thousands of dollars this year from my stocks because the market is so good and I’m not even middle class. Typical liberals always bitching about everyone else having money. Go out and make it for yourself!
128 2018-10-16 22:54:22 @Filapek Hi Rudi what does the red writing on the stocks in the broker call mean?
129 2018-10-16 22:53:43 Why am I not surprised ha, I don’t have much money to throw into Robinhood...unless I take my money from Stash. I will have to probably find stocks that are $30 or under a share and just buy 1 share.
130 2018-10-16 22:53:13 In my 40 years this has been a constant. I have always questioned Canadian capital markets ability to price IPO’s. Maybe it’s just the demand is so much higher in the U.S. for new stocks or our sectors are too limited.
131 2018-10-16 22:52:49 someone help how do I buy stocks
132 2018-10-16 22:52:25 Stocks going up and down is normal.
However when there is a lot of cheap money flowing around plus tax cuts that are primarily invested into stocks then the risk of stocks being inflated/overvalued in an artificial bubble increases.
133 2018-10-16 22:52:21 My 401K and NVDA and AVCO stocks are doing quite well, Wally....
134 2018-10-16 22:51:27 Am I suppose to just take your word that your stocks have gone down. I'm pretty sure under every President stocks go up and down. You win some you lose some. He is a real President, your blinded by the garbage social media/news (gossip) pushes to you.
135 2018-10-16 22:50:53 Good day at the #stocks
136 2018-10-16 22:49:46 i still have a few more months before im confident enough to actually put money in for stocks but i’m a little jealous of people who have their stuff together since canada’s legalizing weed tomorrow. 
137 2018-10-16 22:49:02 For me. I'm just buy weed stocks or tech stocks haha and play the market. I look for small gains. Sell and then rebuy when its at a lower price. I also have dividend stocks that I hold onto. And probably won't touch. If I can make $0.50 a share. I usually sell.
138 2018-10-16 22:48:49 How the fuck do stocks work?
139 2018-10-16 22:48:28 No wonder bank stocks are having trouble
140 2018-10-16 22:48:14 I only play stocks I am familiar with like $ba $msft...there are only 10 I know. $tsla.. I'm in $msft up 2 points up 7 points in $ba too.
141 2018-10-16 22:48:11 Does this mean you will add partial shares, automatic dividend reinvestment and possibly OTC stocks?
142 2018-10-16 22:46:48 @jimcramer You should invite Dr Coraesh on your show. many momentum stocks will slow next year. CERS will just be beginning. 10Fold revenue and more as it gets Global approval.
143 2018-10-16 22:45:36 It’s just almost overwhelming, because there are so many stocks to choose from.
144 2018-10-16 22:44:42 The cool thing about the stock market is if you're a decent person you'll make contacts and begin to collaborate with other people. It's a whole community people don't see. My friend @Jaytanoo discuss stocks all the time. Others like to remain anonymous, so always respect that.
145 2018-10-16 22:44:28 There are so many ways for you to #invest your #savings. Real Estate, Stocks, Bonds, CDs, Life Insurance, Annuities, Mutal Funds, Gold, Art, Collectibles...the list goes on. Each has advantages & disadvantages. But don’t let your money sit idle. #weisstips
146 2018-10-16 22:43:59 Where are the next batch of FAANG stocks going to come from? My bet is they're going to come out of blockchain/cryptocurrencies
147 2018-10-16 22:43:22 You lied about bump stocks. #TruthMatters #TNSen
148 2018-10-16 22:42:40 The Fidelity news is interesting, but I think it's already been priced into #Bitcoin similar to how stocks price in news. Clearly we're starting to see more and more institutional interest, but we have been talking about it for several years now. Right now, not much of an effect.
149 2018-10-16 22:42:40 From a very broad level its mostly about monitoring the flow each day and watching for certain signals. Ex: smart money buying leap contracts then switching to short dated contracts and sweeping them up....Also check the charts, the big boys love stocks that are bleeding.
150 2018-10-16 22:42:20 High prices for fish are a red flag for the decimation of wild fish stocks.  High prices result from shortages, and give an incentive for more fishing and poaching.
151 2018-10-16 22:41:29 If the Dow 30 Industrials move 10 points, that equals about $64.20. When cryptos move up or down, it means actual 1:1 gains or loses. But remember your stock broker helps you buy/sell stocks for real money. Cryptos have no real value & good luck finding a buyer when you want out.

157 2018-10-16 22:40:02 I find tinder to be a great learning experience. You get to learn all sorts of new acronyms & see pictures of random household items. Also it’s a great way to see how people made out in the food fishery. DFO could use it to do a study on fish stocks

159 2018-10-16 22:37:39 With one month's salary invested in the stock market over the last week, I made more money from the stocks today than I did at actual workj... :'D that's crazy
160 2018-10-16 22:36:42 auto stocks are 4.2 pct. please expect to hear from my lawyer. (Just need to think of a clever name like horse face for you first)
161 2018-10-16 22:36:27 One of my stocks spiked  like a mofo today. Kinda makes me want to drop everything else and invest full time.

Investing is the only thing I’ve ever done in my life that pays me what I am worth, besides the military.

Of course, sitting at a computer is easier than Soldiering
162 2018-10-16 22:35:30 this would just be a guy eating mac and cheese and buying auto stocks tho
163 2018-10-16 22:35:01 Yes so do I,but when screening stocks it does not come up with correct charts correlating to my preferences
164 2018-10-16 22:34:59 Yeah. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I have to somehow de-program myself from this market based approach. Stocks are just tokens of cash that don't depreciate as fast as real cash or gold or anything like that.
165 2018-10-16 22:33:14 Yeah pretty much only trading US stocks. Google "Norbert's Gambit. A good way to exchange CDN into US funds. Also read both of Mark Minervini's books on trading. It is literally all you need to know to succeed. Study those books.

167 2018-10-16 22:28:20 @FoxNews @SenateMajLdr maybe tax break for rich can be clawed back 2 pay 4 some of these important programs that benefit the middle & lower classes. D'ya remember what the rich did w/tax break? In 2nd 1/4 alone they bought back $436.6B worth of stocks. They didn't improve plants.
168 2018-10-16 22:28:02 $NFLX price action increasingly looks like $TSLA... and the monthly returns of these stocks increasingly look like the monthly returns of Amaranth before it blew up. 

Once the vol becomes this insane, it is no longer a buy and hold. Volatility preceeds collapse.

179 2018-10-16 22:18:47 Yes I do and maybe a bit lower.  A good fib pull could have $WUC as low as $1.80 cdn and still maintain a bullish chart. This is a good stock, make no mistake, but pulls are inevitable even with stocks that eventually go to da 'moon'.
180 2018-10-16 22:18:27 A formula used to calculate basic wood density has recently been corrected. Basic density is widely used to compute carbon storage by trees.

181 2018-10-16 22:16:44 The signs are everywhere but the new wave of professional traders know better. I think we need a poll asking how many folks actually short stocks or for that matter have a margin account. I have a feeling fintwit will loose a lot of traders when we turn lower for good.
182 2018-10-16 22:16:42 Ur math is weird. If 10% of amerikans own 80% of all stocks... How do foreigners then own 40-50?? Check the math, son. #MAGA

184 2018-10-16 22:15:55 The O/S has remained unchanged. Tell me that stocks you have been in at 0001 were not diluting! Also this new CEO already has a new existing business with real revenue! Once the name & ticker change become official and fins with the new company revenue drops we will run hard!
185 2018-10-16 22:15:42 Also, just wanna say, the “conservative” thing to do (if u examine ppl, say, conservatively investing in stocks) for the world is to actually listen and use facts, like science. The #GOP, not listening to solid science, are the ones practicing hocus pocus #witchcraft.
186 2018-10-16 22:15:16 We like him just fine! Overall stocks are up nearly 30%.  All my kids got jobs back, after losing them under Obama, & my retirement is once again looking doable. I'd trade stock advisors before dissing this @POTUS if I were you!
187 2018-10-16 22:14:30 I can see now how this is a sneaky ad for yes on 1, which I didn't before you responded.  

While what you said about ecological effects, as long as native stocks can return and spawn, which they do through management, there isn't much issue. 1/2

189 2018-10-16 22:14:12 I wouldn't give a damn if you had any interests in SA or in Russia, why? Al Gore and Obama trumpeted investing Billions in Solar Energy at the same time they owned and bought solar stocks. Why is it ok that they cheated?
190 2018-10-16 22:13:39 While drawing and quartering comes to mind, they do not seem to match the crime. I suspect, 2 days chained in stocks would work.

258 2018-10-16 21:38:30 I’m definitely researching stocks. That’s where the big bucks are 
259 2018-10-16 21:37:43 What are stocks?
What are bonds?
My mind is stuck,
Can't understand.
260 2018-10-16 21:37:23 Every investment is a risk. But there are some ways to lower your risk. That's why there are such things as "developed world" stocks and those that are "emerging" markets. But developed world at least gives out information and has some transparency. There is the SEC.
261 2018-10-16 21:36:46 Gotta have multiple sources of income to be financially stable. There’s nothing wrong with a 9-5 but other lines of income that don’t require you to physically clock in is a bonus. For example...stocks, having your own business...
262 2018-10-16 21:35:13 Number of leading stocks today: 10 $SPY $QQQ $FB $GOOG $AMZN $GOOG $AAPL #DailyStkLeaderCount
263 2018-10-16 21:33:21 Well, you need assets of all maturity. You can't only have long duration assets like stocks and bonds. You need zero maturities as well. This is where banks come in. They are maturity transformers....And they do this without govt dictate.

265 2018-10-16 21:32:34 I'm hearing there is meant to be a stock market crash in 2019  not sure our chatter bot is VERY disinterested in that idea  Talking of next wave of "tech"

266 2018-10-16 21:31:14 Bear in mind that the conditions to the shorters get burn are there

The game is simple: buy tesla a squeeze the anti-tesla bugs, shorting other stocks

388 2018-10-16 20:40:13 Oh God. I have so much to say about the oncoming financial collapse and mega-crisis that I get overwhelmed. That's why I just picked on one company (Uber) and did a driveby on it. But I could do something similar for junk bonds; student debt; property; stocks in general; China...
389 2018-10-16 20:38:58 Just bought Aurora cannabis co. Stock for $11 a stock. Bought 20 stocks at $220. Cannabis becomes legal in Canada tonight and that stock should rise due to recreational demand. Going to sell at $100+ a stock. that’s a $2k+ profit. Easy money trading stocks.

401 2018-10-16 20:33:31 Release the taxes then.
BTW, When people say YOU they don’t mean just you, they mean the Trump company. Your sons. Jared the “Real doll” and most likely Ivanka, definitely all have some stocks, investments or “DEALS” benefitting from those two nations. 
But we all know that.

412 2018-10-16 20:27:23 There are no seven million jobs open but if there is they are mostly minimums.  I wonder how much you know about stocks.  If down 300 one day and up a 100 the next it does not mean the market is healthy .  Quit trying to spin.

418 2018-10-16 20:24:51 World stocks soar: US +2.2%; Europe +1.6%. Solid earnings reports caused jubilation and spurred buying. Today was one not to worry about US-China tensions & slowing global growth. Both will not likely impact 2018 earnings but 2019 may be another story. Anyway, enjoy today!

420 2018-10-16 20:23:30 Stocks are basically a piece of a company. Buying stocks means you own part of that company. The price of stocks depend on mutiple factors. Either way, if you play your game right you can sell your stocks and become wealthy
421 2018-10-16 20:23:19 I’m far from ignorant. I have stock so I’m good but most of the people I see riding around in raggedy pick ups (no exaggeration) with Trump stickers are not benefiting from stocks. Obama took over our economy when it was in the crapper and turned it around without corruption.

434 2018-10-16 20:20:32 Don't usually like to hold stocks through earnings, but on my new $NFLX long-term investment... I'm okay with this outcome

436 2018-10-16 20:19:55 Today in stocks: someone said climate change will kill domesticated grasses and make beer rare. This caused wheat futures to spike.

437 2018-10-16 20:19:36 I think we'll see a drop in Gulf Coast stocks and a severe drop in Gulf of Mexico production that will skew the data.  Cushing stocks will probably be about 1.5-1.75-million barrels higher.  Still peak turnaround season but will begin winding down shortly.

444 2018-10-16 20:18:13 Yeah great, stocks are up. But it takes $10.00 more to fill up my tank at the gas station than it did two years ago.
445 2018-10-16 20:18:02 The funniest part about $NFLX is that despite a 25% + move off its highs, it was still in a long-term uptrend above a rising 200-day moving average.

Momentum stocks have drawdowns, they go up and down.

Congrats to anyone that caught the move AH.

448 2018-10-16 20:17:28 It's almost like stocks still have accelerating earnings momentum and what happened last week was just a glitch in the matrix
449 2018-10-16 20:15:44 NFLX seems to do the opposite of the other FANG stocks. If they are good on earnings the others are bad and vice versa. We'll see this Qtr.

460 2018-10-16 20:14:13 We really don't spend much time thinking about market level valuation, we own 20-25 stocks and have strong opinions about those. But it seems to me most of the metrics suggesting the market is rich implicitly assume margins are "too high". That could be true, but hard to say.

514 2018-10-16 20:04:17 On the eve of legalization most cannabis stocks closed down.  Wonder what tomorrow has in store...
515 2018-10-16 20:04:16 NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks surge, erasing some of their big losses from last week; Dow Jones industrials climb 546 points, or 2 percent.
516 2018-10-16 20:03:59 Or, just always be long stocks...makes it easier.
517 2018-10-16 20:03:58 .@realDonaldTrump .@stevenmnuchin1 .@senatemajldr You’re lying. Real wages stagnant. Big co’s workers on fodstamps. Defict keeps growing. Tax cut benefits went to rich & big co’s, which used it to buyback stocks. Sears, Mattress Firm file bankruptcy. But S&P is doing great right?
518 2018-10-16 20:03:28 @ABC Any news on METABANK not issuing direct deposits to thousands of GREENDOT, NETSPEND, ACEELITE, and other card members??For some these funds have been in limbo almost a week! They aren't letting anyone know because that will drop their stocks for sure!
519 2018-10-16 20:03:24 Cannabis is legalized in Canada tomorrow.  Watch those stocks soar as financial institutions jump in.
520 2018-10-16 20:02:53 Stocks rebound as the Dow goes up 540 points
521 2018-10-16 20:02:37 Very true. And when I write to the BBC (again) to ask them to remove JHB from my screen, do I expect them to put her in the stocks and have her flogged? No.

531 2018-10-16 20:00:09 OK be honest. Before you sent this tweet, you bought stocks in manufacturers of antidepressants.
532 2018-10-16 19:59:52 Tech stocks already starting a comeback? 
533 2018-10-16 19:59:01 Expected growth effects from higher bond yields and worsening trade dynamics hit stocks last week; DJIA lost nearly all YTD gains. USTs rallied throughout the week, ending 3-7bps lower along a flatter curve, but AAA municipal yields were as much as 6bps higher through Wednesday.
534 2018-10-16 19:58:45 You're implying here that people NEED or want govt money. In fact, they don't. Smart investors want real return generating financial assets (stocks, bonds, etc) that can be converted at times into par valued assets like money market funds and deposits.
535 2018-10-16 19:58:40 May the QE rise up to meet you. 
May the stock buybacks always be at your back. 
May the sun shine warm upon your face, 
and always buy the dip.

544 2018-10-16 19:54:41 Actually, we mostly save in financial assets with a low level of moneyness -stocks, bonds, etc. 

Zero maturity instruments with a high degree of moneyness are actually the worst way to save as they guarantee a negative real return.

Credit makes prices/labor is too expensive because (1) it gives a riskless return to lenders and (2) makes demand artificially raise price
557 2018-10-16 19:48:29 Good afternoon all. The stocks especially the Dow seem to be on the rise. But is it really improving the smart answer would be no because with a major corporation filing bankruptcy that sends a bad trend that’s not to say it can’t bounce back because it can

648 2018-10-16 19:10:30 If I were a trader, I wouldn't hold US stocks into the close today.

652 2018-10-16 19:05:59 So what happens to all the income from the houses, the farms, the stocks, dividends, & the hedge fund? Where does that go? How do u deal with emergencies? Where does money for weddings & parties come from? Do u have to sell a farm to go buy a new TV? or fix the roof? Lol Come on
653 2018-10-16 19:05:36 It's the guy who owns Red Bull's private island. I don't think fresh food stocks are really a problem.
654 2018-10-16 19:04:55 this is likeliest scenario.  All at once so stocks (equities markets) only move one time (as reaction).  Just widen the band is typically the "least worst" and first step.
655 2018-10-16 19:04:49 Stock market off the hook today.  Quick 5% correction and boom right back up. #stocks

676 2018-10-16 18:53:54 The Dow jumping around like this is sort of unhealthy as they say not normal.  Or maybe its companies artificially bringing down the market so they can buy back their own stocks for less. But they wouldn't do that - would they? Those rich de have it all figured out.

686 2018-10-16 18:48:48 Slightly more cautious on this since the CAKE debacle. Someone should really be looking at Liberum on this as pointed out- 20% of issue price. I get stocks go down as well as up but that’s a massive slap in the face when it only listed last November

751 2018-10-16 18:29:18 The thing that fucks me up about it all is that we've had these socialist programs for a long time, but suddenly they're deemed "wasteful" now that old white male's wealth is established and able to accumulate in stocks with (minimal) capital gains taxes.
752 2018-10-16 18:28:53 Everybody involved in that "In Your Area" advert should be rounded up and placed in the stocks to be pelted with rotten fruit and dog faeces.
753 2018-10-16 18:27:22 Smart people sell into before a trend rolls over.  But with interest and housing the connection is a no brainer. Stocks actually anticipate some future though they can be overly positive or negative. It's always about the direction of the trend

760 2018-10-16 18:21:45 Yes a question for you, I wonder if it's still safe to be in stocks like Mannkind? Or do you not see an imminent crash?
761 2018-10-16 18:20:59 Why don't you stop taxing dividend returns from stocks like income? Hell why don't we stop taxing income all together.

764 2018-10-16 18:20:30 Not for me. I made an all in on weed stocks two weeks before Trudeau and think this sector has legs to run another 5-10 years. Sticking to one sector allows me to consolidate all my DD to one sector, know hundreds of companies and how they trade too. Good luck!

766 2018-10-16 18:20:01 My post is specifically about Bitcoin. I do track US Stocks somewhat, this venus retro period until NOV 16 looks to correlate with a correction. I do think Stocks are topping out, but I don't see a crash coming just yet.
767 2018-10-16 18:19:54 Many of these OTC cannabis stocks were ripe to be manipulated by the promoters and micro-cap frauds.  Just look at $MSRT.
768 2018-10-16 18:18:56 unlike the 1% and 4% who are moving stocks out of the market in to bonds because they can. and the corporate entities are buying stocks back from shareholders and giving themselves better raises and parachutes, whilst laying off the workforce. trickle down does not work.
769 2018-10-16 18:18:48 how did technicals work for you in 2008? better yet, just give me your fundamental case for what will drive stocks higher from here.

774 2018-10-16 18:17:31 let me know. because most of the people i've spoken with haven't been helped at all. and we own stocks. they took a real beating last week and in february. to the point, where we are getting out of the stock market, so we don't lose anymore.
775 2018-10-16 18:16:41 If your in the market, you've done well. I would get out before midterms, though. If Dems control the House, stocks will fall.  If Reps win the House one of those crazies will drop a bomb on the White House and stocks will fall.
776 2018-10-16 18:16:40 Of the 1.2 million net new manufacturing jobs created since the economic expansion began in 2010, 2/3 were created under Obama’s watch. Trump has done nothing to help those numbers, since his tax cut went to the top, resulting in stock buybacks which artificially inflated stocks.
777 2018-10-16 18:16:32 It is his change in policies that triggered the huge over all rise since he has been in office. No not everyone owns stocks but the stock market does affect the economy and that affects us all.

781 2018-10-16 18:12:36 It is amazing how quickly market sentiment changes. Just yesterday we were heading for a bigger correction. Now a 2% pop and all of a sudden euphoria hits and nobody is holding any cash.

790 2018-10-16 18:09:30 What is a bubble?  Do you have no understanding of the stock market?  Stocks can be over or undervalued, you are relying on herd wisdom.

But when they hand tax breaks by the fistful to the 1% who don't need it and corporations who buy back stocks they stab us in the back and expect us to pay with OUR earned benefits. #VOTE

797 2018-10-16 18:08:17 Lack of diversity amongst the higher paying dividend stocks. Also, dividend rates fluctuate and aren’t necessarily stable. It’s good to have some but not your entire portfolio.

799 2018-10-16 18:06:09 True for financial assets (stocks / bonds), but inflation here should help anyone in debt + with real assets (many / most of us) and would probably help the US reach a more “normal” debt level. I can’t imagine how bad things would get if we had another bout of deflation.
800 2018-10-16 18:05:48 Add back several hundred million estate planning (see kids net worth) & a few expensive divorces.  Alternatively, passive investing in a stocks (S&P) doesn't create jobs the way starting & running businesses does.  Capitalism-risk taking works that way.  Long live capitalism.

Spot the bagholder...
908 2018-10-16 17:15:48 S. stocks jumped as earnings from major banks and health-care firms bolstered confidence in the economy. The dollar fell as geopolitical tensions appeared to ease.
909 2018-10-16 17:15:38 Can I interest you in my collection of single figure P/E cash rich deep value stocks...their chief advantage is they do nothing unpleasant price/chart wise...but pay hefty dividends whilst you await the market realising they’re actually growth stocks

914 2018-10-16 17:13:08 The Price Action on many Stocks today suggests that Market isn't really too fazed by Brexit and collective wisdom is that a Deal will happen. Also implies that recent miserable Selloff was more the typical Autumn silliness.
915 2018-10-16 17:13:08 Ford is paying much more for steel it must import. Price increase must be added to MSRP of each car. Car sales drop. China drops Ford sales 43%. U.S. Ford fires thousands of employees; stocks around $12. Hooray for tariffs! @realDonaldTrump @GOP @exoticgamora @StopTrump2020

920 2018-10-16 17:11:07 The point being - stocks are artificially inflated right now. Your 401k is inflated. It’s probably going to drop some. And these rich people aren’t job creators - they’re short term investors playing the market and using short term goals/gains while avoiding long term consequence
921 2018-10-16 17:10:10 Quite a few $NQ_F stocks setup with nice support below price. if $NFLX beats tonight, upside is certainly the easiest move. Just don't like to leave my account in the hands of earnings.
922 2018-10-16 17:10:05 Only?  Do you think the “Trickle Down” economics had anything to do with that. The tax cut was supposed to be used to lift wages and create new jobs. Instead it was used to buy back stocks. Reaganomics didn’t work then and they don’t work now
923 2018-10-16 17:09:32 dude. The tax cuts were not stimulative unless you count share buy-backs lifting stocks. The fuck are you talking about?

• 162 were down at least 30%.
• 113 were down at least 40%.
• 69 were down at least 50%.

934 2018-10-16 17:03:47 PORTFOLIO up 0.9% today - not amazing but after recent slide it's a very welcome change  !! No big moves although #MCS managed 6% gain. In general the Charts on my Stocks look to be turning up but of course with Brexit Clouds anything can happen.
935 2018-10-16 17:03:41 You can operate stocks but index can't be in operators control I think
936 2018-10-16 17:03:21 Smart investors and rich people are smart diversify their holdings i.e. in banks, in CDs, in stocks, in real estate, some is speculative, preferred stocks, Government securities and again some goes into banks
937 2018-10-16 17:03:07 Arguably, not much worse than stocks and other speculation instruments, but the whole "get away from government oversight and taxes" thing has to have an effect, yeah?

940 2018-10-16 17:02:32 Of course there is a reason, the media is propaganda for the Democratic party. NK is denuking, GDP is around 4.3, black unemployment at record low, stocks at record numbers, great new trade deals, being respected on the world stage again. None of this gets coverage.

942 2018-10-16 17:02:09 The odds are the conditions will revert to the mean but the economy will be able to whether a slowdown. The valuations will slowly reflect a slower growth environment over the next 18 months, but a seasonal rally for stocks should happen after the elections... $SPX

948 2018-10-16 17:00:31 Rare to see investors enthusiastically grabbing the stocks, merely because the prices are plunging.
949 2018-10-16 17:00:31 Speculative cycles in jr stocks especially any sorts of resources play, if one dares to risk $$$, one could make some $$$ if timing is right especially when the tide carries all boats. Sadly, for the most part, besides the spec SP phase, most jr stocks fail miserably.

957 2018-10-16 16:59:37 Except that's not what's happening to the ratio of the corporate/wealthy tax cuts. Instead the focus has been buying back stocks for their own gain.

958 2018-10-16 16:59:30 Having said that, in the stock market, the sentiment is created by broader factors, generally distinct from the price of the stocks.

980 2018-10-16 16:46:00 Sure, For Intraday you can try multiple box sizes -

1. 0.05% x 3 for indices
2. 5 x 3 (absolute) for indices
3. 0.1% x 3 for stocks

U can also mismatch for particular stock, like if intraday if u get movement more then 0.3% everytime, u switch the column.

987 2018-10-16 16:44:10 These are “flows”, I.e. movements of money. As opposed to “stocks” which show the totals held by a sector at a particular time.

1005 2018-10-16 16:39:20 Not all penny stocks will be multi bagger, not all small cap will mature to mid cap.

1030 2018-10-16 16:26:35 My foray into trading was in stocks 5 years ago and I've not touched it since then, so can't really comment to be honest pal. I imagine with my experience and knowledge I could make it work on stocks though. I have 20 charts open on FX like I said and that's more than enough

1065 2018-10-16 16:13:39 From $GRDO pr of Oct 12: "Investors who are only interested in the day to day price of the stock would be better served by investing in other issuers whose shares fall outside of the scope of penny stocks."  This goes double for $RDGL.  #GoodAdvice #GetOut

1071 2018-10-16 16:09:46 Thanks! I keep hearing that fx markets have been getting volatile. Do you think fx is significantly better than other traditional markets (stocks, commodities, etc) for a TA trader? One disadvantage seems to be much fewer trading pairs compared to stocks
1072 2018-10-16 16:09:26 I think it's a ridiculous comparison, and the coincidence that highly leveraged publicly traded stocks went up at the same time as not only the rest of the stock market  but also leveraged buyout funds did (at a time of falling interest rates to boot!) is a terrible strategy.

1079 2018-10-16 16:07:05 Read somewhere Russel 3000 started crashing, like our small caps. Then comes Russel 1000/2000 before Dow breaks eventually. As the interest rates increase, US stocks will follow. Only thing to be seen if UsD and Oil also cracks. If so, then any dumping would be temporary.
1080 2018-10-16 16:06:56 This is also not an easy market to trade so stay within your risk parameters and trading plan. Those are the only things that will keep you safe in a tough market.

1162 2018-10-16 15:36:39 i would steer clear of social media stocks. the only jewel in the bunch is instagram, still undervalued in my opinion, but since its connected to facebook i wouldn’t buy. the external pressure to change social media will erode a lot of the allure over next few years.

1175 2018-10-16 15:33:19 Lowest unemployment rate, record high stocks, minimum wage increase finally, business and consumer confidence at all time high. Even Obama is trying to take credit for it. I hope he continues to 'wreck' the economy.

1179 2018-10-16 15:31:39 I have income from companies through stocks (and I'm sure Trump has some from licensing, too), but I don't own any.

1181 2018-10-16 15:31:15 A lot of Nigerians are often infactuated with the idea of waking up, dressing up and going to an Address(work) as making a living/ being hardworking

1195 2018-10-16 15:27:50 This perception is so misguided. The majority of stocks are owned by insurance companies. Further the stock market is only a fraction of the data that is relatable to a strong economy. There is much more data on that. Trump is keeping it simple for people like you.

After the housing market crash, the prices were of course at super cheap prices, so its not a big surprise if it went up by 3x in 10 years.

1208 2018-10-16 15:24:48 Main reason stocks are doing so well is because the wall street crowd are using their huge tax cuts to buy back a trillion dollars of their own stock. What happens when that dries up? They'll start selling off again and we have a greater economic disaster than 2008!

1217 2018-10-16 15:22:44 I didn't say that was his fault, I said he still hasn't done anything against it. Not even banning bump stocks. So every mass shooting since then, yeah that's his fault. He doesn't even try to regulate anything because there's so much money flowing.

1222 2018-10-16 15:20:42 I bought cannabis stocks. It’s being legalized tomorrow in Canada.
1223 2018-10-16 15:20:13 80% of stocks traded on the market are owned by 20% of the population, & the market is being propped up by corps buying back their own stock. This is being financed by your #TaxScam, which tax payers will be on the hook for, along with a trillions added to the debt and deficit.

1241 2018-10-16 15:16:07 Buying back stock is hedge against hostile takeovers. Stock market people don’t make money, unless they move stocks. Excuse me, churn stocks. Wouldn’t it be more of a real market, if companies got money from stock sales? Value comes from production, not cap gains to investors.
1242 2018-10-16 15:15:13 yes because i sold the open on these stocks. im not stupid
1243 2018-10-16 15:14:54 @SeeMyJays_ be careful w/ folks on twitter pumping up stocks. Some of them are paid to make low priced stocks seem amazing, so they can sell their own shares high. Check out @timothysykes if you haven’t already. Dope mentor.

1418 2018-10-16 14:29:39 Yes Blackrock, Im looking for a nice basket of terrorist related stocks.  Is there an ETF for this?
1419 2018-10-16 14:29:31 95% of today's sell off what Cramer this morning calling on shorting ALL pot stocks into this. what a hole he is.
1420 2018-10-16 14:29:24 Funny how wages remain stagnant and when all those tax breaks came out thousands upon thousands of people got wage increases. anyone can buy stocks just because so many Americans choose not to, you choose that as a talking point, weak...
1421 2018-10-16 14:29:23 I finally decided to buy a few marijuana stocks yesterday. Based on my past performance with purchasing stocks, there is a serious likelihood that the entire cannabis industry will collapse and disappear. 
Yes, financial disaster is my super power.
1422 2018-10-16 14:29:13 Big tech, like $AMZN, not holding gains. Big reversal in pot stocks. Market looks like it will eventually test recent lows. When it does, BTFD!

1430 2018-10-16 14:27:11 We only trade out of desperation. Even in 2015 we moved up for Collins and didn’t move down when we took flowers 20 spots above where he was on most boards. The anti-Patriots. As a game theory guy who trades stocks it just makes me sick
1431 2018-10-16 14:27:10 I'm not saying the stocks should not be *volatile* - I'm saying they should not be so highly correlated with the rest of the market.
1432 2018-10-16 14:26:46 $mcgi another stocks that need to go to 0001 and let's us all wait until company figure it out. Can't keep doing this 50% flip n dilute

1449 2018-10-16 14:23:00 Steven they are are some liberals on this page. I think if Trump gave them 50% increase in there stocks they would complain about it saying it ain't enough we want 51%.

1451 2018-10-16 14:22:40 Your figures aren't right if 10 percent of Americans own 80 percent in stocks , that only leaves 20 percent to non Americans , not 40 to  50 percent .

1453 2018-10-16 14:22:22 Also what is Trump suspose to do about 40-50% of stocks being owned my non Americans? And wages are based on the government regulations. Business’s are in to make money. People will always me rich and people will always be poor. Trying to make the poor rich makes communism.
1454 2018-10-16 14:22:08 Pat, curious if you ever short stocks when the market is sour?  Thank you.
1455 2018-10-16 14:22:07 Of course, it should be noted that roughly 80% of stocks owned by Americans are held by the richest 10% of households.

So, we should turn our attention to the individual side of the GOP tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefit those making more than $500K.

They get a double dip.

1458 2018-10-16 14:21:54 Just in from Citi's global asset allocation team:

"We take EM assets, including equities, back to neutral from underweight and thus buy the dip a little in stocks overall:"
1459 2018-10-16 14:21:48 I wish I was old enough to have invested in Apple, Amazon and Bitcoin when stocks were cheap!
1460 2018-10-16 14:21:43 No. The stock market is going up because the economy is strong. Under Obama, we had near 0% interest rates and people bought blue-chip stocks that paid dividends instead of putting their money in banks. The Obama economy was the slowest growth after a recession in history.
1461 2018-10-16 14:21:42 Stocks aren't up, pal. The DOW 30 is virtually flat on the year.
1462 2018-10-16 14:21:40 Challenging morning if you missed the pot stocks. Feels like afternoon trades or tomorrow for me. Market holding the gap well but market leaders don’t seem to care.
1463 2018-10-16 14:21:16 After a correction like last week, there is a tendency for the undisciplined to make rash buys in a futile attempt to quickly make back their losses. It's called "revenge trading". In contrast, I'm patiently waiting for stocks that meet my buy criteria, however long it takes.
1464 2018-10-16 14:20:53 Stocks help the rich. What about the 40% of American children living in low income households? You are not helping the middle class.
1465 2018-10-16 14:20:24 I'm an investor as well...I purchase nothing but blue chip stock.  I've lost thousands in the past month.  It's not hard to read live stock reports.  Maybe you don't know this, but red means they're down and green means they're up.  Hope that helps you read your stocks.
1466 2018-10-16 14:20:11 @realmemobiles when will be stocks available??
1467 2018-10-16 14:19:56 It's a trap for all retail bulls. Since Subramania Swamy is tweeting against Adani nowadays, this stock would be falling by 66% in a single day like Yes Bank. Have to be very careful on Adani Stocks till election..
1468 2018-10-16 14:19:56 Rahul's speeches are turning more and more into laughing stocks. Why ? He does no public benefit talks except trying to educate his audience on his anti-Modi stands.
1469 2018-10-16 14:19:47 Number one laughing stocks... you delusional creep.
1470 2018-10-16 14:19:43 P/E alone doesn´t tell you anything. Better buy point in the last 10 years was Jan/2009 when US stocks were trading at 70x earnings (basically, there were no earnings). Better selling point for banks was 2007/2008 when P/E was around 5x. You need to go deeply on your analysis.

1531 2018-10-16 14:02:21 An intellectually honest watching of this video would lead one to conclude she was referring to a ban on bump stocks/high capacity magazines. The “journalist” did not ask her “for a ban on guns?”; he directly followed up a line of questions on accessories with just “for a ban?”
1532 2018-10-16 14:01:27 From here on, demand and supply are the main sources of the stock movement for POT stocks, just like any other commodity in the market....

1743 2018-10-16 12:36:48 A fair point.  However 
a) even at 5% I'm pretty sure that I'd still want some allocation to stocks, and
b) if I was certain that the 10 year was going to 5% any time soon I'd sell everything and buy a levered short bond etf.

1802 2018-10-16 12:04:58 If demand for a particular denomination can be met from stocks of coins already held, then banks will not need new coins. If new coins are required and we hold stocks of previous years then these are circulated first. (2/2)
1803 2018-10-16 12:04:50 I would think at least one year. Lot of stocks in Canada and Eastern Australia to move. No one will make them accountable. Traders will just aim to make profit and get some losses back.

1807 2018-10-16 12:00:21 WSJ is claiming an Uber IPO may go north of $120 bn...  and people say ICOs are scams.

1809 2018-10-16 11:59:18 So you personally found an edge in stocks, but not in FX markets? Therefore you only trade stocks. But would u say that it’s harder in general to find an edg in FX? Maybe I’m in a dead end and should only focus on stocks, that’s why I am asking you.

1851 2018-10-16 11:31:57 More to the economy than stock prices. You might think that people are buying stocks anticipating the GOP will flip and they will make money. Not sure it’s smart to bet on a person who has bankrupted several companies during his lifetime.

1893 2018-10-16 11:03:56 I would summarize (or perhaps generalize) this advice as "buy those stocks whose prices will go up".
1894 2018-10-16 11:02:05 It’s possible, if they communicate opportunity and prospects effectively. That’s what market gives “multiple” for. As of now It trades at 11-15x, when all other game stocks trade at 25-30x. They can get a premium if they communicate better.

Cube announced BTOB’s comeback. Stocks are going up

2301 2018-10-16 05:09:59 #Bitcoin is going to be an asset like stocks bonds instead of being a new #solution for old #currencies issues. A big deviation from the main mission that possibly could be the biggest threat to #bitcoin.

2303 2018-10-16 05:08:02 (Bloomberg) -- Asian stocks traded mixed Tuesday, paring initial gains, as the dollar inched higher alongside Treasury yields. U.S. equity index futures advanced and the yen retreated.

2307 2018-10-16 05:02:12 Yeah, although millennials themselves aren’t having many kids... great portion believe in crypto over stocks.

Folks are somehow trying to correlate stocks and crypto. Not sure why they are doing that? Bitcoin etc will do what it’s going to do regardless.

2332 2018-10-16 04:39:31 I'm all for tron but I for sure will call out things when I believe something is put out is not the best outlook for the company. Its needed, or community trust will drive this into the ground like a penny stock. Ex. stocks-Drys, Tops, Dcix etc, shipping companies.

2421 2018-10-16 03:41:59 Most of the stocks in my watch are gapping up slightly in green. Let's see how supply acts at open, either we go red or form a base after consolidation to close in green.
2422 2018-10-16 03:41:51 To identify a moron you can see people linking stock exchanges with the whole economy, USA aur china aur puri dunya k stocks oper neche ho rhe hen, because its a flawed model and the  big fishes on top manipulate the market to earn from loosers
2423 2018-10-16 03:41:27 I agree. @OilGasCanada All that sunk cash into these projects and wonder when shareholders are going to panic and sell off oil stocks? @JustinTrudeau @RachelNotley @jkenney Also all pension funds invested @cppib which means impact on all Canadians when stocks tank.

2430 2018-10-16 03:37:25 Ceos are getting rich and leaving anyway. Time to invest in stocks. Apple with 5000 dollar investment then monster energy drink then steak and shake yielded 57 billion.
2431 2018-10-16 03:37:14 Commentary: Fine. Building a wall: will not work, and is fiscally irresponsible. Tax cuts are not doing anything positive as companies are buying back their own stocks and laying off workers. Trade wars are bankrupting farmers. The stock market is in the same place it was last yr

2436 2018-10-16 03:31:40 Ok. But they know it now and are doing nothing. In stocks there is a saying “a hold is a buy.”  So clearly, they are still buying.  Never thought I’d miss “empowerment,” “transparency” and scarves.

2505 2018-10-16 02:48:34 FWIW, I've never felt comfortable trading individual E&P stocks. There's just so much going on under the hood that has nothing to do with the price of crude.

2509 2018-10-16 02:45:06 percentages dont matter as traders. dollar return matters. If you can make $10,000-100,000/month I dont really care about the return.

As investors you should be looking for stocks that multiply many times over. single digit % return is waste of time unless you have 10-100M+
2510 2018-10-16 02:44:02 So you bought like 10 more stocks with your profit, right?

Isn't that how stocks work :P
2511 2018-10-16 02:43:51 There is no logic any longer in stock market investing & their predictions. We could have a horrific tragedy & stocks would rise. Pure greed. It’s gonna crash & ya all are gonna have ur pants down when it does!

2519 2018-10-16 02:38:38 Tech shares/stocks had a brief bounce back yesterday, but still not ouf of the woods. At this time, it's easy to feel depressed and convert to cash, but that's short-sighted. Remember Warren Buffet said: "We continue to make more money when snoring than when active."

2522 2018-10-16 02:36:39 Those are the same guns. They shoot the same bullets at the same velocity. Same capacity. The one on the bottom is not an AR15.

2540 2018-10-16 02:29:44 And I hear the right often denigrate and threaten “snowflakes” and “libtards.” Gosh, just try to talk about background checks and bump stocks will have some Republicans threatening to shoot!
2541 2018-10-16 02:29:09 You are kidding - banning bump stocks is an issue. How about a national debt of 21.6 trillion dollars costing $9,000 +(nine thousand +) interest for each US citizen this fiscal year alone. Yet, Republicans pass a Wealth Welfare tax cut,
2542 2018-10-16 02:29:06 Smart people don’t pay too much attention to his raves. It is just hot air. People who support him in large are those more worried about their arms sales, or stocks, and other greed-based interests. They don’t care about kids in cages, or Indians who can’t vote.

2550 2018-10-16 02:22:14 a guy in a frat was trading stocks during class today and kept yelling out as things dropped. the entire class.
2551 2018-10-16 02:21:38 Wouldn't you agree that would occur after one more pullback? Stocks not likely to rally off one bottom after a selloff like we had? Thanks in advance

2557 2018-10-16 02:19:14 Nowhere in the video did she say she was for a ban on semi automatics across the board. The only questions were about bump stocks and high capacity mags.
2558 2018-10-16 02:19:01 Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that The best business advice I have ever heard is that don't play the penny stocks..

2560 2018-10-16 02:18:44 Can you tell me how you made that background? I don't understand how people do it. Idk if it's stocks or what but I'm dumb lol. Also nice header 
2561 2018-10-16 02:17:01 $BGFT $FLTT are my two most interested stocks right now for sub penny plays. I already made money on $MLHC but the way the market is reacting I dont trust it much. If orders start filling at .001 its all over and bashers get their way. Was great news
2562 2018-10-16 02:16:55 All the trumpsters claiming the .25  in interest rates responsible for stocks tanking. Ignoring the reality that the #TrumpTradeWar is dragging all stock markets down with his ignorance.
2563 2018-10-16 02:15:58 All I've seen is him promoting a financial transaction tax for Wall Street which really translates to all traded stocks. It would have to be rather huge.
2564 2018-10-16 02:15:53 Can anybody give me some advice on purchasing stocks

2571 2018-10-16 02:11:55 You are kidding with that graphic right? Mind blown. It's like a bad joke.  There is no miracle.  There is nothing.  He has done nothing but give money to the rich and set a time bomb with his crazy tariffs plus he fell inove with a dictator.  You don't own stocks. Zero for you.

2573 2018-10-16 02:10:31 Stocks trading at premium valuations will have to deliver super premium results else street could punish them

2578 2018-10-16 02:04:57 Be as concentrated as you can be. Direction. If you know what you are doing diversification becomes useless.
The goal is to have more of the portfolio into six stocks maximum.
2579 2018-10-16 02:03:16 @StocksToTrade 2 questions.  Can the brokerage SureTrader be integrated and used through your platform?  Also wondering if any mobile app plans are in the works?
2580 2018-10-16 02:03:03 As of 10:00 a.m., PSEi 6,948.15 up 21.64 points or 0.31 percent.  #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2581 2018-10-16 02:01:38 I wonder what the result would be if we actually attempted to avoid ALL work related travel for a year for everyone. Sure, it would tank airline stocks, but we are talking about our planet...
2582 2018-10-16 02:01:05 Greek traders are option buyers n sellers, who get benefit from time decay, high n low vega, delta strategies(option greeks). TA with fundamentals will give you a good entry in a company with strong financial statements(stocks only).
2583 2018-10-16 01:59:55 Don’t worry about your gun, trump won’t even block bump stocks like he promised he would
2584 2018-10-16 01:59:02 Gas prices are up 20% since @realDonaldTrump became President. Real people have to buy gas, they don't own stocks where the wealth has been made. The mid terms are coming soon for a theater near you.
2585 2018-10-16 01:59:02 Why of course! You said it was the best of the cannabis stocks based on the strong balance sheet and partnership with $STZ weeks ago! But now... we have to sell a bit because we can’t be .
2586 2018-10-16 01:58:57 This is so deeply illogical!

How many thousands of stocks does T.Rowe Price own? And $TSLAQ cherry picks the one that they believe validates their conviction that TSLA is imminently going bankrupt!
2587 2018-10-16 01:58:48 @ericnuttall Thanks for the great presentation! Seeing extreme values in international micro-cap E&P's w Brent exposure. Looking at stocks priced at multi year lows, although share price has not increased their chance of survival has. $80+ Brent =drilling, paying debt, no hedging
2588 2018-10-16 01:58:16 Usually the more traditional IBD type stocks have looked better. lol.  Most of these names that I've posted is that they are cross-listed on the TSE and are very liquid for that reason.  CGC used to trade as TWMJF before it got up listed. Several already have uplists planned.
2589 2018-10-16 01:54:56 I think the concept is great especially if the people who live in the communities a) own the stores b)are the third party aggregators of the produce that stocks the shelves and c) are growing the food.
2590 2018-10-16 01:54:14 Stocks went up bro
2591 2018-10-16 01:53:53 Who down to learn how to trade stocks with me?
2592 2018-10-16 01:52:51 It puts it thru all of "these" stocks for the week that earning are. I stay the hell away. I am not going to bet red or black. But yes, I'd bet that over time, the options are valued so that sellers will do well. But the variance is too great for me.
2593 2018-10-16 01:52:20 I'm scared as he'll over these cannabis stocks but I'm going to pretend that $100 never existed. All is well tho
2594 2018-10-16 01:51:38 Wow :0   Of course, the balance sheets of the major CBs are still QEd up. We're just tapering reinvestment of proceeds now. In the prior easy money periods, no QE. So it was an even easier period than ever before aside from duration. We need to see how stocks did after prior ends
2595 2018-10-16 01:51:08 Meant stocks 
2596 2018-10-16 01:50:56 Don't worry its not just Pakistan. Stocks fell in NA and I did take a hit in last 2 weeks. So your drama of hell breaking loose in PK only is a farce or perhaps you are noy aware of Int'l markets.
2597 2018-10-16 01:49:41 First News 16 October 2018 - US stocks lower on tech weakness, PSEi -1.11% to 6926 (14.6x), Economy - Remittance, Inflation, Bonds, Oil, Oil tax suspension, Moody's Outlook, EDC, JFC, MEG, PCOR, LBC, SMC, URC, FB, Third telco - Converge ICT, NOW, PTT, LBC
2598 2018-10-16 01:49:11 I’m so mad I took out my money out of the weed stocks cause now that I’m seeing it all go up... 
2599 2018-10-16 01:47:21 Think bigger, stocks and big banks. I’d be Robin Hood.
2600 2018-10-16 01:46:16 Thanks so much for replying.  I am a macro swing trader and feel really comfortable trading based on charts alone.   Gold and silver look like a bottom here and if stocks/bond suffer here I feel gold could rally.   I am a complete newbie so do you think its risky if I bet 5% on..
2601 2018-10-16 01:45:25 I knew you had more to say than “ohhh”
2602 2018-10-16 01:45:02 There he is!!! Only 45 min later
2603 2018-10-16 01:44:58 earnings puts implied vol through the roof on some of those stocks (for good reason).

I'm sure there's a killing to be made selling premium, but I'm not well-equipped enough to take advantage.
2604 2018-10-16 01:44:04 Absolutely! Nobody seems to understand that ultimately a crippled economy works to the advantage of the wealthy and Republicans. Land and stocks get cheaper when you are in a recession.
2605 2018-10-16 01:43:06 Stock Market is down, now is the time to buy stocks at a cheaper price per share.
2606 2018-10-16 01:42:41 Yes indeedy. I check on earnings date whenever I put on any of my crazy ratio spreads in stocks like that.
2607 2018-10-16 01:42:26 Starbucks stocks just fell 100 points ... and the market is closed!
2608 2018-10-16 01:40:31 Good point.  Buying stocks now....
2609 2018-10-16 01:40:04 I NEED TO GET MORE INTO STOCKS OMG
2610 2018-10-16 01:39:39 The market misprices everything because there's a belief out there that we're in for totally bearish conditions in small stocks when in fact that's all we've had for 10 months.

Seeing bottoms in quite a few things . Of course I can't control the broader market
2611 2018-10-16 01:39:21 Now do your trading strategies that you teach really work? I think there is a massive disconnect that you purposely create to benefit you. You’re benefiting me too, I know the ins and outs of this game. I actually take the time to research stocks not just alert my followers
2612 2018-10-16 01:39:19 Okay, I'll order on Friday. Hope it's not limited stocks 'cuz I'm from work then 
2613 2018-10-16 01:38:38 $NFLX earnings tmrw will define growth stocks going in 4th qtr. $TLRY not all that bad for trade, $450 mil raise last week, strong momentum.
2614 2018-10-16 01:38:34 I don’t agree with her always, but I appreciate the explanation of the opposing view.  With stocks, if I like a stock, I care more about why I’m wrong than why I’m right.  #a2council
2615 2018-10-16 01:38:04 October 16, 2018: As of 9:35 a.m., PSEi 6,947.23 up 20.72 points or 0.30 percent. PSEi opened at 6,936.17. #PSEiupdate #PSEi #stocks
2616 2018-10-16 01:34:35 ...so last week my 18yr old son says casually, "Mom, I think I want to get into buying stocks." I replied, "Wow, that's great. We can study together and I've got some great podcasts & books."

1 wk later: he tells me he opened his acct & bought his first 10 shares.

2620 2018-10-16 01:32:30 On a long enough time frame ALL stocks go to zero. There are NO original DOW stocks. That's why they call them "stocks & bonds"

2624 2018-10-16 01:29:14 Wait till end of month. Pull back occurs every 8 months. If stocks don’t pull back they fall too hard when there is a real sell off. New all time highs by end of year.
2625 2018-10-16 01:29:11 Sure. Lots of opinions around this space. I do like the idea of paying less for things. Tends to be a good predictor for future returns. It's funny how when things go on sale people usually by more of. With stocks tends to be opposite. Buy more when it goes up in price..
2626 2018-10-16 01:28:54 CVSI is in UK and Japan.  Btw, nice move today by CW with all MJ stocks up huge!  Up $.12, lol.  I sold all my CW, not enough short term upside.

2642 2018-10-16 01:17:02 Checked my Stocks this morning...most all have doubled 
2643 2018-10-16 01:16:47 time to go for value hunting, IMO. stocks with high price-to-book are ripe for a pause. $JNJ, $DAL, $IBM, $VTV, $T could be good bets!
2644 2018-10-16 01:15:51 Not trying to be negative but I would suggest picking a new mentor. Tim Sykes isn't really making millions trading stocks.
2645 2018-10-16 01:15:30 Your napping box stocks having a good run on the napping box index?
2646 2018-10-16 01:14:24 Ah....spoken like a good little liberal.   Does it sound pervy when he says Jobs, GDP up, stocks UP, prisoners brought home, tax cuts, no war with NK, ISIS defeated etc. Do those terms sound "pervy"  to you?
2647 2018-10-16 01:14:12 Best advice in these times is don't go broke. Just do nothing.  We don't trade stocks, we manage capital.
2648 2018-10-16 01:13:35 Any penny stocks u recommend?
2649 2018-10-16 01:11:56 Just Dmed with Goldman friend of mine, he said high volume retail stocks are the next big short like $COST @Costco bc of #Amazon $15 minimum wage hike.
$BJ $COST $HD $LOW $BBY will all either have to pay $15 an hour or top employees will walk. Margins can’t take big wage hike
2650 2018-10-16 01:10:25 General mkt: The major long-term technical positive is that the breadth divergence has only been in effect for < 1 month vs the 3-4 months that is regarded as the minimum to expect prior to a primary top in a mature bull mkt #stocks

2653 2018-10-16 01:09:00 Depends how you define value. Some view as stocks on low p/e, price-book, price/sales etc. Others as buying something for less than it's intrinsic value. Challenge obviously working out intrinsic value. Dispersion between growth and value in market still seems high..
2654 2018-10-16 01:06:31 So for my birthday I really spend my savings on college but instead I bought 4 stocks. I don't know if it's the best choice but I am at peace with it & excited.
2655 2018-10-16 01:05:16 We are reaching the point where it will be considered immoral to own stocks in companies that do business with Saudi Arabia.
2656 2018-10-16 01:05:03 it's pretty hard to get iirc. noisebridge usually stocks a lot of it

2660 2018-10-16 01:03:46 And Canadian Cannabis stocks soared. Are you still affiliated with CCN Max?
2661 2018-10-16 01:03:24 stocks are more volatile short-term (< 1 yr). that could prohibit a lot of people, particularly the people who live in countries with shitty money
2662 2018-10-16 01:02:23 Me too (left a lot on the table)... Better to lock in those profits cause the one time you don’t that win turns to break even or loss faster than you might anticipate. I sometimes unload half and ride the rest. Good habit to lock it in!
2663 2018-10-16 01:02:01 stocks are in a rut

2672 2018-10-16 00:55:53 Stocks are dollar denominated financial assets with a floating price. 

Money market funds and deposits are dollar denominated financial assets with a fixed price. 

Again, this is basic finance. It’s not a controversial point.
2673 2018-10-16 00:55:38 The LDS church spends 0.7% of the amount they collect from tithing in Humanitarian aid, and 100% of that comes from the Humanitarian Aid Fund. Out of $7,000,000,000 they collect from tithing, none of that goes to helping people while billions goes into real estate & stocks

2683 2018-10-16 00:48:04 Mike Wilson at Morgan Stanley sees a 10-15% drop remaining to play out in US stocks.
A "rolling bear," some are calling it.

2688 2018-10-16 00:45:20 Important night of earnings for the US market tonight. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Johnson & Johnson, IBM and Netflix all reporting. The way markets react to NFLX will be particularly interesting, and could tell us where stocks go from here over the short term.
2689 2018-10-16 00:44:51 280char limit prevented me to add the “risk-free” bit. 
Aren’t stocks and bank deposits subject to company and bank risks? US Govt NFAs are relatively risk-free and at present are subject to “Trump Risk”

2693 2018-10-16 00:42:10 “Tully writes, "If Bakkt delivers and big Wall Street begin trade cryptocurrencies with the same ease, safety, and scale as stocks, bonds and traditional commodities, it could be a tremendous forward leap in the evolution of cryptocurrencies." 
2694 2018-10-16 00:40:58 And I'm sure his preferred stocks or bonds in the company are safe going through bankruptcy versus the common stock most people hold.
2695 2018-10-16 00:40:56 Stocks are “share” denominated. They may have a par value, but it’s meaningless.
2696 2018-10-16 00:40:52 thank you Dr. Mark Skidmore and @USAWatchdog for pointing out that central banks are printing money to buy stocks and other assets....which seems a bit away from their mandate

@MilesFranklinCo @JasonEBurack
2697 2018-10-16 00:39:30 Hopefully weed stocks will. 
2698 2018-10-16 00:39:04 $TLRY I think pot stocks could have massive rally Tilray could hit 500 plus $CGC  could  be the  biggest winner in end
2699 2018-10-16 00:38:42 Looks fundamental but it depends on what "trends" they refer to here: "It then uses that computing power to select 30 to 70 stocks to own "based on their probability of benefiting from current economic conditions, trends, and world- and company-specific events,""
2700 2018-10-16 00:38:04 Nathan, stocks and bank deposits ARE dollar denominated. What currency do you think your bank deposits are denominated in? Renminbi?  Yen?  Bitcoin? C’mon. You guys are smarter than this. Don’t make me go debate the stupid Monetarists when I get bored....
2701 2018-10-16 00:35:47 All y'all broke muthafuckas ain't even realized i invested in pumpkin stocks so thanks for making me a rich man #buylowsellhigh

2703 2018-10-16 00:35:35 When stock market falls 831 points in 1 day & over 500 the next. I can’t frigging control the market. Im sure the Saudis who invest heavily in US tech stocks had something to do with it. Specially when they murder a dissident WaPo journalist.
2704 2018-10-16 00:35:29 Really wanna get into penny stocks but that is too risky
2705 2018-10-16 00:34:25 A couple weeks ago the Fed chair said we are a long way from neutral and that we may go above neutral - but then stocks fell 6% and everyone was sure rate hikes were done lol - chances for 4 hikes in the next year went from 18% to 15%
2706 2018-10-16 00:34:09 Bullshit. I got raises 3 raises at my job since he has been President, My 401K is bananas. My stocks are up 30%. The economy is doing wonderful and that benefits everybody no matter your color. And you are conflating illegal immigrants with immigrants. Not the same.

2713 2018-10-16 00:31:18 I’m a 33-year-old 6th grade teacher. I don’t have stocks. Mommy & Daddy do. And I’ll say it again—I’d have voted for Bernie if he’d won, just like I will this time if he’s the nom, which he WILL NOT be. 
One thing I’ll never do is stay home or throw away my vote. But that’s me.

2718 2018-10-16 00:28:27 Five years of left side distribution and overhang on $CBA in a plummeting real estate markets. That's alot of money that is now underwater. Rarely do stocks recover from here.
2719 2018-10-16 00:27:44 STOCKS:  Surprising the stock market was lower today.  Fox News encouraging buyers.  Wall Street encouraging what Wall Street's refers to as DUMP MONEY (Passive Investors) to buy.  And Stocks are oversold.  Are Investors becoming concerned because of deteriorating economics?
2720 2018-10-16 00:26:48 .@rhenderson513 Please. Stocks go up and down. Learn to live with it.

2734 2018-10-16 00:15:30 @RobinhoodApp "Total Returns" for stocks should include their dividends, but it doesn't.
2735 2018-10-16 00:15:26 I don't think the NRA cares about gun rights. They are more about gun business stocks.
2736 2018-10-16 00:15:09 That’s why you don’t give them anything

@realDonaldTrump made a huge mistake siding with the #left on bump stocks

Give them a inch and they will take a mile

Never give them anything, nothing, not one damn bit

#2a is not negotiable

They will chip away at it until it’s gone
2737 2018-10-16 00:14:32 Bitcoin, no but I own more coins than stocks. I have been in the stock market for over 25 years. 90% heavy with gold miners. I could be wrong, but yet again there’s lots of money to be made. Not this currency crap with pictures of dead people on polymer/cotton/paper

2743 2018-10-16 00:10:03 Yes, I don't sell. But I also don't want to buy much more because of the large tax when selling stocks. If I had money I probably would buy more btc, tbh.

2745 2018-10-16 00:08:35 I truly wish you the best of luck.  I do very well trading high volatility penny stocks.  I will continue to do so.  I'm sorry you didn't follow.
2746 2018-10-16 00:08:05 But are those articles written about actual shaming punishments by government action (stocks, scarlet letter, etc)?  I was thinking more of an ethical/social norm argument.
2747 2018-10-16 00:07:25 How much do you have saved up for retirement? How much is in your 401k? Stocks? Roth IRAs? You don't want police, fire department, good roads? Don't get out much I take it.

2754 2018-10-16 00:03:47 Goes the other way too. It’s a piece of cardboard. We aren’t selling stocks. I’m not offended when someone counter offers
2755 2018-10-16 00:03:30 I still think they’re going lower with higher rates. But if stocks get hit hard they’ll catch a bid bc of safety. But the trend is still down
2756 2018-10-16 00:03:07 @bjPtrade So now the problem is whether to cash out of the Canadian marijuana stocks before the 17th, ala buy the rumor, sell the news.
2757 2018-10-16 00:03:02 When will the SEC deal with the wash traders, the pump and dump squads, and the rest of the transgressors in crypto the way they have handled traders in penny stocks and Elon Musk?

2761 2018-10-16 00:00:34 It’s nice to publicly come out against bump stocks. If only as a member of the House of Representatives, you had some power to make it so, like (checks notes) write & pass a bipartisan bill to make bump stocks illegal. #TalkIsCheap #ActionLouderThanMereWords
