43 2018-06-17 23:27:36 Do you invest into any stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, etc?
44 2018-06-17 23:22:18 It’s dropped 19% the last month & I think it’s gonna continue for the year But all the stocks are dropping too so  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ just gotta w8

48 2018-06-17 23:15:15 Depends. Of money? Yes. Stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments which represent a claim on an underlying asset? No.
49 2018-06-17 23:14:48 Because right now you don’t own real Apple stock or have the ability to take custody of your own shares - it it was a token you could control it. 
It also would allow stocks to move more easily between brokers or owners.
50 2018-06-17 23:12:34 When the tone of the market changes, it is what it is. The tone is gonna change shortly, even more near Aug/Sept. When it does, even good stocks go down. Maybe MU gets to your target before that, we'll see.

52 2018-06-17 23:07:28 There's a nice description of the sererve of mental energy in Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman - critical thinking and attention requires energy, and we default to non-thinking when energy stocks are low.

Very striking example.
53 2018-06-17 23:06:55 Like, him and Stefan Molyneux are considered laughing stocks in most philosophical circles out there (if my time on /r/askphilosophy and a few other philosophy forums is anything to go by); they just make shit up as they go along and retrofit them into what they know.

61 2018-06-17 22:47:17 Change from a margin acct to cash account. You can daytrade as much as you have in your acct on trades (options only). Once you’re $2000 is spent for the day your done trading. Money will be avail next day to trade again (options only). Stocks take 3 days to settle.
62 2018-06-17 22:46:42 lmao, neor is allergic to stocks
63 2018-06-17 22:46:33 Not really that is like comparing the entire stock market to penny stocks.

69 2018-06-17 22:36:23 Ignorance must be bliss. The stock market has been on the rise well for some time, and it's risen a lot recently because of the awful tax "break", which allowed corporations to buy back their stocks. Also, those manufacturing jobs aren't returning. People are getting laid off.
70 2018-06-17 22:32:59 Is it ilegal for CEO to buy stocks - YES or NO? - and if so when is legal and when is not.
71 2018-06-17 22:32:04 My last job was a janitor and I'm a rich man. I own two houses one of which I gave to two sisters to live in, rent free. I was lucky and not from investing in stocks.
72 2018-06-17 22:31:44 Change never comes with playing the con. Those who jumped on penny stocks and the wall streets scams all went down together. It didn't lose value because more people got seduced by the con. Same with pyramid schemes. 

Sorry, I wouldn't support this AT ALL. #GETLOUD
73 2018-06-17 22:31:05 Lol. Im not going into the whys of the failings. And i have not mention stocks! And saving money will get you no where. When you learn. You understand. Besides. When you first ride a bike you fall of. Does that make you scared to get back on?

I $cost average into stocks.
Account size growing. That’s the whole freaking goal. If you’re goal is to just gamble you can do that at track or in Vegas.
78 2018-06-17 22:27:52 But why waste years of your life to learn a low wage job when you can start right away? I don´t need to know how to fix a car to buy stocks.
I don´t need to learn how to sew suits to invest in markets.

87 2018-06-17 22:19:02 And that liquidity premium wouldn't be zero sum? I can see how a fully liquid asset is worth more than a illiquid asset, but it seems like liquidity premium deals with preference between two otherwise equal stocks. If you tokenized everything wouldn't it reset the baseline?

Don´t choose poor jobs.
91 2018-06-17 22:17:20 The employees get stocks, so when Amazon stock goes up it goes up for everyone who works there too. That's like each employee having a $6000 bonus. I think you get 2 to sign up, can't cash out for 2 years, and you get 2 more over that time.

104 2018-06-17 22:06:04 From years of spending time at HC. I realised HC should be used as a dumb money retail indicator. If ever one of my stocks consistently make the most discussed colomn in the site. Its time to get out. If Post are getting 100 TUs for a post, becomes a short.
105 2018-06-17 22:05:13 The warehouse I was at definitely had AC and while it was hard work it was much easier than picking strawberries and working the citrus grovea of Florida which was my first job there.

114 2018-06-17 21:55:26 Most of their stocks ARE locked in back, w/ limited amounts on the floor

N there are more effective preventative measures are utilized in that situation

119 2018-06-17 21:47:05 I may be wrong (I’m really not the Wall St type...) but afaik stocks are still “bearer instruments” - you can still get the physical certificate if you put in the work - it’s just that no one cares. Which is a problem for the token theory if you ask me
120 2018-06-17 21:45:06 yup, you can also get mixo new pack! its from there that I got these cool stocks :)

130 2018-06-17 21:34:43 You shouldn't, its unethical.
When shorties cover their position they are buying from other holders who think is a good idea,  but at an unoptimal level, this people trust you. When you advice shorts to close you are hurting some good guys who will no longer own those stocks.
131 2018-06-17 21:34:28 Btw VanGuard Mutual stocks has both organizations in their mutual fund portfolio.
132 2018-06-17 21:33:51 The banks are bullish, the bankers are,a bank.just sits there until a banker pushes and pulls. I suggest dont use investment firms, use the federal reserve banks, stock brokers, and research on the stocks to.invest in. Research on your own, hold it in, dont speak a word.
133 2018-06-17 21:33:50 Really nice is it stocks or did you make the shapes / backing?
134 2018-06-17 21:33:40 Thanks! It’s a niche group, but I’ll take that compliment 
135 2018-06-17 21:33:05 The big difference for me is putting large enough amounts of money in a spec stock with confidence and knowing its ‘real’ potential upside. Management play a big factor in that confidence as well. Im not interested in so called ‘blue chip’ stocks.

136 2018-06-17 21:33:00 Just keep on buying more and when the time comes and the Roadster is actually out.. you could sell the stocks and pay for the car with the money you just made. It is said to be $1000 for each one in the year of 2020 so that would be just amazing.

142 2018-06-17 21:21:15 I was offered to become a contributor to well-known service and I refused because they wanted typical stock picking show, etc. Stock picking is random process unless it's done by smart algo, in which case there is nothing to explain to audience. I'll stick to own work #stocks
143 2018-06-17 21:20:35 @elonmusk We the people need more TSLA stocks.. Secondly, what is the difference with the Founder’s Edition Roadster?? 250k is a lot for something we know little about.. I know you won’t disappoint but still it’s a little sketchy. Especially with what is said in the T&C.

148 2018-06-17 21:13:35 For sure: but remember you are a trader. I’m happy to enter a stock at rock bottom and wait for the 10-20 bags to come based on an acceptable set of probabilities. I can do this with 5-7 stocks and have much less stress. If there is a shock, then yes, time to move on.
;D
149 2018-06-17 21:13:14 I know you don't trade pre market but some of these NASDAQ stocks open different bloody times which is why I'm usually having a peak at what's open at 4am. Any idea why some open different to others? And where do I get a schedule from? Nasdaq?

170 2018-06-17 20:44:37 I actually hate weed stocks and rarely look at the charts. There are too many things that can effect the way they trade. Sort of like Pharma stocks. I don't touch them. My main reason for recently trading them was I felt that "the news" of that vote would help them pop.
171 2018-06-17 20:44:05 I am not ignorant unlike some I actually do research. This is not a law on the books. They decided to criminalize EVERYONE in an effort to force the Dems to give them money.

Let's bring back the stocks and shame these cowards. Pelt them with rotten food.

270 2018-06-17 18:44:26 Misleading headline. Sale is of 1 particular stock bcuz he got huge premium. Leap to suggest a call on the entire market especially when Buffet was on CNBC a week ago saying we are in 6th inning and economy is strong. + Buffet is a net buyer of stocks every month including 2017.
271 2018-06-17 18:42:16 At least you're now admitting trump and GOP are using children as hostages.

That's progress, MAGA terrorist
272 2018-06-17 18:42:15 I said a week or so ago to short his stocks.
273 2018-06-17 18:40:51 Not basing off that. Should’ve rephrased that others stocks are rising causing him to fall

277 2018-06-17 18:35:42 Not enough money for food? Invest in stocks. You get free steak dinners at the shareholder's meetings.
278 2018-06-17 18:34:40 Indeed!! A @Tesco near me in London finally stocks it - absolutely incredible. Bela's sample was from a San Fran hotel vending machine, may try again 
279 2018-06-17 18:33:57 Betsy Devos has a lot of conflicts of interest, but Tina Smith can’t possibly go after her for it because she’s just as conflicted with her millions of dollars of medical device stocks while she’s urging repeal of ACA medical device taxes. Ethics?
280 2018-06-17 18:33:00 Not for open borders just not simple enuf to think 3rd century solutions work for 21st century problems.

282 2018-06-17 18:29:48 They are maniacs.but remember,Fed started slashing fed funds rate (at 5 1/4% late-June 2006) to 0% and it didn't stop stocks from losing 1/2 their value in ensuing yrs. QE turned stocks up but Fed return to QE would be admission of failure &there'd have to be stock collapse first
283 2018-06-17 18:29:07 So I bopped a Sheik with Marth and a lot of Side B, he went Marth, side bed for 30 secs, SDed both stocks then left on FG
284 2018-06-17 18:28:36 Stocks should be temporarily suspended until the placing is completed or fails. From a Brokers standpoint it’s also far more transparent. However you can’t compare micro cap placings to a Lloyd’s issue. Risk rating is worlds apart
285 2018-06-17 18:27:24 Preferably in a pillary or stocks so he can suffer    the projectiles thrown at him & then suffer a slow lingering death before the vultures consume him. POS gets his commupence!
286 2018-06-17 18:26:30 He should be in the stocks having rotten fruit thrown at him.

294 2018-06-17 18:19:51 Mmm yes and no in my opinion. I think I see where you’re coming from and while I often hold for quarters at a time there are also new stocks hitting new highs that may be worth a look with fresh capital. 
295 2018-06-17 18:18:42 I’m really interested in buying some stocks I never forgot about what I learned time to just do it 
296 2018-06-17 18:18:41 Why is that the booming economy, the huge job growth, the stocks going up like crazy, all are because of Obama, as the libs say....but the immigration issue is Trump? It only works when it fits the narrative. MAGA! TRUMP 2020! DUMPDENIRO!!
297 2018-06-17 18:17:09 Yeah.. for me it's just staying out of these stocks...

302 2018-06-17 18:11:36 Doesn’t need to be. Tokens are single use. Like movie tickets or game credits. Gift cards are tokens too. The world already has many tokens. Stocks are tokens that represent company ownership.
303 2018-06-17 18:11:36 Stocks plunged as Reynolds American Inc. unveiled a dowdy scotch tape today.
304 2018-06-17 18:11:29 That's not happening. We're doing 3 stocks with no smash ball or items on legal stages. This game will be defined by how each player utilizes the fast mechanics of the game.

313 2018-06-17 18:05:20 If you'd suggested investing in SPY I'd have no quibbles. It's the leverage that I'm trying to convince you is scary. People should absolutely invest in stocks. They should absolutely not use leverage unless they _really_ know what they're doing.

318 2018-06-17 18:03:21 2/2 major improvements can be made with current number on hand, also a higher sr would put further pressures on silage stocks for long winters, when I'm in top 10% I can worry about more then

320 2018-06-17 18:01:15 Ahh!
321 2018-06-17 18:00:19 First, it would be illegal for the Fed to buy stocks/ETFs. In a desperate situation (melting stocks markets) THEN they might try.

322 2018-06-17 17:59:46 Then Australian big companies sell their stocks in Australia stock exchange, those countries many people will like to buy our stocks of our Australia big companies, otherwise their people will not be willing to buy our stocks on our stock market

326 2018-06-17 17:54:20 The market has dropped by over 20% before. My point isn't the specific number, just that the fund can go to zero, which isn't really possible for a whole market ETF. I'm talking about leverage here, not about stocks.

331 2018-06-17 17:46:45 a basic problem with these bold predictors is they conflated momentum in price action with momentum of application/use. there is underlying biz momentum in stocks like NVDA & NFLX. Is there massive growth in Bitcoin usage?

333 2018-06-17 17:43:03 (Reuters) - Fears of tariffs and a potential global trade war have jostled U.S. stocks over the past few months, but there is a sense among investors that the market is taking the drum beat of rhetoric and statements more in stride.

336 2018-06-17 17:39:12 Stocks are not issued by the government and investors understand that companies can issue new shares and dilute them. Financial assets are inherently centralized and inherently part of a legal jurisdiction

353 2018-06-17 17:07:11 This is true. No different than living in hyperinflation. Big issue is 7.5B ppl do have access to Appl stock. Equities are a vehicle to the rich. Bitcoin is a vehicle for everyone just as resistive to inflation as stocks except its a medium of exchange. Properties matter

378 2018-06-17 16:41:25 Most wealth is valued in a unit of accounts. Which makes them subordinate to the currency. Not above it. The purpose of a currency is a medium of exchange and a unit of account. Not to store wealth. Art, RE, stocks are stores of value but no mediums of exchange.

391 2018-06-17 16:20:03 You really should spend some time to understand that billionaires don't have an income of $1 billion+; they have wealth of $1 billion plus, typically based on the market value of their stocks.  They then borrow using the stock as collateral.  Ergo, $0 income.

402 2018-06-17 16:12:34 Ah, #FathersDay, that time of year where I learn from greeting card companies that my dad and stepdad both must be freaks because they aren't into golf, fishing, auto repair, stocks or curmudgeonry.
403 2018-06-17 16:12:22 ...a comprehensive bill that includes a provision that raises the age to purchase a gun, bans bump stocks and allows law enforcement, with the approval of a judge, to bar a person deemed dangerous due to mental illness from owning guns for up to a year.

406 2018-06-17 16:09:56 I remember in my statics class they said Wall St is dynamic & fluid. Stocks go up/down. It shows in my mil TSP & 401k. Im not going to pretend like I know the reason why Sony dropped, but Idc. Sony dropping a few pts isnt going to have an effect on me completing/buying a game.
407 2018-06-17 16:09:11 Another valuable learning I’ve applied to my trading strategy:

Always aim to take about 2 long and 2 equally sized short positions at the same time (with different stocks of course). This is to anticipate big unexpected moves in the whole market. #RiskManagement

511 2018-06-17 14:36:02 Nice try. You’ll notice that nothing in what you shared mentions separating children from their families. The previous policy was catch and release. The new policy, announced on April 6, is the issue. @realDonaldTrump owns this.

528 2018-06-17 14:15:49 Swing & a miss! Put the giant Trump sign on them because these are & always will be the Trump Family Internment Camps. @potus & his crime family own this policy change.
529 2018-06-17 14:12:17 So Mr. @POTUS, how did Carrier and Harley Davidson work our for you... They took the money, bought in stocks, paid dividends, closed down US plants and opened ones in another country under your watch.

535 2018-06-17 14:08:19 Obama stocks increased 15%. Good. Trump hovering near 30%. Stocks have near zero to do with govt - regulations and taxes do and Obama stifled business to grow in US. Trump removed that, hence more biz money flowing in US since dotcom days. Sure OB did some but he relied on gov
536 2018-06-17 14:07:27 GOP claims $ for welfare for asylum seekers w/pre-existing conditions of domestic abuse & gang welfare better used for Americans on welfare. Ironic GOP gave most unfunded tax cuts to corporations w/ pre-existing conditions of record profits who bought back stocks.#PoliticsNation

546 2018-06-17 13:59:57 I do remember Elian Gonzalez, and no democrats didn't cheer. It was a grey area because HIS FATHER WANTED HIM BACK IN CUBA and his American family wanted him to stay.  His mother drowned coming  into America and his father wanted him returned.

549 2018-06-17 13:57:07 According 2 Buffett yardstick (capitalization/GDP) stocks r priced 2 deliver annual return of -3% over next decade dividends included. 
When you compare it to 3% on 10y T-Bonds then you’r looking at -6% differential.
Sell stocks sooner than later from now !
550 2018-06-17 13:57:01 That’s a bigger lie than Obamacare itself. I’m a retired insurance analyst. Actuaries used to laugh, because it was obvious insurance companies were going to get filthy rich. They did, I’m here as a witness. Insurance stocks went up over 300%. America got scammed by Obamacare!
551 2018-06-17 13:55:48 Do you agree with your lord God on high, Donald Trump, taking children from their parents or not? Because that is the only real question that needs to be answered. Not who Nancy had dinner with in 1994,not if Obummer had a penpal, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS RIGHT!!
552 2018-06-17 13:55:26 Remember that his biological father, who had legal rights, was the one who wanted him back in Cuba?  oh wait, your tweet was just bait.
553 2018-06-17 13:55:08 Please highlight the part where it says kids are to be taken away from their parents.
554 2018-06-17 13:55:00 Sir, beautiful message. Timely reminder for all new investors on the importance of long term investing, both in quality time with family members and in quality stocks.
555 2018-06-17 13:54:46 I'll wait while you point to the part where it suggests, authorizes, or even hints at ripping babies from their parents, slapping bar codes on their wrists, and keeping them locked up without human comforting, to use specifically as a deterrent to parents legally seeking asylum.
556 2018-06-17 13:54:43 Find it difficult to see when the market wants to take money vs funding good trending stocks in a good market on a consistent basis.

559 2018-06-17 13:52:37 Not at all like that actually...age laws are well....laws...refusing to make a cake because of religious reasons is a completely different issue.

But there is no laws in place that say if you sell guns...you have to also sell bump stocks or high cap mags along with them.
560 2018-06-17 13:52:34 So, Rick Sanchez, you agree or disagree with the policy of ripping children from their families, this is where the narrative keeps becoming crazy. It's this trump showing might or democrats overriding the whole republican government. I'm confused.

565 2018-06-17 13:49:35 The way stocks were perceived as an investment vehicle for the previous generation, cryptos are for the future generations. You'll hear more of this in times to come

571 2018-06-17 13:45:30 Five Million illegal votes was why he lost the popular vote, if he became President he wouldn't have time to golf, he didn't pay 130,000 to Stormy Daniels, he was going to ban bump stocks, he was going to raise age to buy assault style weapons to 21.  Are you really that unaware?
572 2018-06-17 13:44:25 The key principle of stock market is not only to invest in good stock but also to hold such stock with patience for long term. Tata coffee, Tata motors, Hudco and triveni trubine are the stocks which can be hold for atleast 5 years.@porinju

574 2018-06-17 13:42:43 How about Universal background checks, ban high capacity magazines, no guns for people convicted of a violent crime, domestic violence, or stalking. No bump stocks. 3 day waiting period. And I’d personally love to get rid of the Armalite Rifle. You gun people agree to NOTHING
575 2018-06-17 13:41:40 Comparing mutual fund schemes and football team is similar! People use different parameters such as fouls committed, wrong stock, ball posession time, holding of winning stock, shots on target, betting right winner stocks etc. However number of goals (returns) wins matches!

585 2018-06-17 13:32:10 The difference is that there are cash flow’s attributed to stocks.  Some of those cash flows are anticipated.   If the cash flows never arrive, the stock goes to zero.  

There is no cash flows attributed to coins.  There is no mechanism for this.  Going to $0.00 then??

611 2018-06-17 13:05:59 At 50% earnings yield the stock is cheaper than 30% earnings yield.But that is not the important bit.The crucial point is that at the most optimistic sales and profits projections which they would take years to reach, the stocks at current prices are still very pricey

657 2018-06-17 12:22:04 Japan does the same thing at the Intl Whaling Comm: gives $$$$$$$ to poor island nations to subsidize their fishing industries in exchange for their vote to continue Japan's sham "scientific" whaling. Small potatoes compared to TPP but heavy impact on global whale stocks.

Then the saleslady told me that there are only a few left, and I so badly want to cry because I’m trying to spend my money on things that can help me in the future (= health/self-care/books) i love bts and they have contributed
669 2018-06-17 12:01:34 @XiaomiIndia has started advertising Redmi Note 5 Pro in commercials. But why after 4 months of release? My guess is, the initial hype has slowed down and the company is confident to have enough in stocks now. Good strategy to give it another push
670 2018-06-17 12:00:37 I hope they renew the tenures. You would have us hunt and destroy wild stocks to fill your pockets? Farming salmon IS conservation.
671 2018-06-17 12:00:37 Not a fan of how the article emphasizes $CRSP drop from 70 to 53, but omits the fact that the SP flew from 18 to 70 in five months. Also fails to mention their preclinical hold two weeks ago that made no lasting effect on SP even though it should have.
672 2018-06-17 11:57:37 As an actual Witch, I approve of this message. We DO want to take your ARs (and bump stocks, high-volume magazines). Now be “good humans” or we’ll turn you all into the toads you really are!

677 2018-06-17 11:53:50 Bitcoin will acquire a portion of real estate and the stock market because many people own stocks and homes to store their value (due to fiat being a bad SOV). Bitcoin would be a better SOV than both stocks and houses.

694 2018-06-17 11:38:51 If you bought $10,000 worth of stocks in 1942 and simply held on, they'd be worth about $51 million today. On the other hand, if in 1942 you bought 300 ounces of gold (which would have cost you about $10,000), that gold would be worth only $400,000 today.

700 2018-06-17 11:27:18 The most frustrating part: there’s a whole line of pretty un-gendered kitchen toys but Toys R Us stocks them on a shelf at the back of the “girls toys” section and I only found them by accident. Anyway, he has a stand mixer now for cake
701 2018-06-17 11:25:12 In summary - our lowest stocks are: Pasta Sauce, UHT orange juice, coffee and sugar. In non foods, toothpaste and anti perspirant (mens and womens). All donations welcome. Thank you!

703 2018-06-17 11:24:05 Been worried about valuation on stocks and bonds since brexit. My growth fund is still averaging 12% annualized with half the risk of the global indexes. You can have portfolios with lower risk and good returns. #sleepatnight

718 2018-06-17 10:58:54 It needs to be fact-checked (I tried) but I read that tRUmp & Sessions both own stocks in private prisons. If...*IF*...this is true it explains so much. I hope, for humanity's sake it's not true, otherwise humanity just sank further into the abyss. 

Can someone fact check?
719 2018-06-17 10:53:48 Actually you are wrong. Look at the amount of responses they get from crypto coverage compared to stocks. I would venture to say crypto is still very much popular. Not sure who you are referring to but Any REAL trader knows that there is money to be made even in a bear market.

722 2018-06-17 10:48:03 Labour stocks this book because it fits in their demonizing Israel agenda. It is an unhealthy obsession. While they overlook real catastrophes in Syria or Yemen, they instead focus on Israel because it is fashionable and trendy. A great way to get young fools to vote for them.
723 2018-06-17 10:46:43 Peut-être que les actionnaires devraient plus se préoccuper de la rémunération des salariés avant de penser aux stocks options et autres bonus qu'ils accordent aux dirigeants lorsqu'ils votent aux assemblées générales.

730 2018-06-17 10:32:45 Fears of tariffs and a potential global trade war have jostled US stocks over the past few months, but there is a sense among investors that the market is taking the drum beat of rhetoric and statements more in stride, the equity market largely shrugged it off.

775 2018-06-17 09:29:17 That’s because stocks have pension funds, sovereign funds, hedge funds, private equity funds as manipulators. Crypto manipulators are “poor whales” who don’t have unlimited cash. So they can’t hold the hype for too long

787 2018-06-17 09:03:15 If 30% earning yield is expensive; 50% for Brit is super expensive although we are not comparing similar stocks. In other words, are you saying all these stocks are super expensive and have priced the growth for several years? Tks

791 2018-06-17 08:56:50 They did that in the UK and in the US and all companies do is use it to buy their own stocks to make them more money. Workers get nothing. Gap between top and bottom gets bigger and wage bargaining power goes down.

793 2018-06-17 08:51:54 It’s on my radar as one of my worst performing stocks this year 2018. So much hype, potential yet the market doesn’t believe it.

837 2018-06-17 07:18:01 But for example: NVidia stocks have surged over the pas 1.5 years. So it is wise too look around the crypto market to see who is also profiting, do you agree/ have great tips?

848 2018-06-17 06:52:56 Yes. Majority do but individual stocks go down far more and if one is concentrated in those, that's trouble.

916 2018-06-17 04:39:04 I addressed that in my last tweet. To profess that everybody is blessed with an advanced degree and holds stocks & bonds is foolish.

922 2018-06-17 04:34:24 Just saw a news story about an app that gives kids money to put into stocks for doing their chores!!!! Kids don’t know what stocks are!!!! I barely know what stocks are!!!! Bitch!!!!
923 2018-06-17 04:22:18 In theory, yes, but then you need to relate the charts and find the unique story. What eyes - brain combo does not software can do that! This just filters few stocks to be checked and analyzed further. Nothing more than that.

Not everybody COULD invest, set up annuities, hold stocks & bonds, etc. I retired early years ago & have lost 15% to inflation. I'm still ok to abt age 100; won't reach it.

943 2018-06-17 03:54:35 Can we count all the times Paul Ryan has said he opposes something but phones in a serious effort to fix it?

Still waiting on bump stocks to be banned, which Paul Ryan also said he wanted.

953 2018-06-17 03:40:13 Exactly:
- many stocks fluctuate like that.  
- if he sold it would impact the value of the stock 4 all
- he’s an entrepreneur who has held onto his stock long-term and continues to pour his efforts into the company, the kind of behavior that drives our economy and innovation.

956 2018-06-17 03:33:45 Exactly, with net worth of $100bn, a 4% change is a lot! But it's not real money if you can't *actually* sell. With automation, the q of a wealth tax on amounts over X, Y types of stock, or stocks traded quicker than Z will gain steam but I very much doubt its time has come yet.
957 2018-06-17 03:32:40 Nas and AMD? You're not going to find a pair of other people who know and understand the market system more... not just crypto but Stocks, Forex, etc

Not to mention they actually hold credentials
958 2018-06-17 03:30:22 I hope NRA challenges it but as I said earlier, they rolled over & didn’t fight it last fall. They had a secret meeting with Trump. I presume that’s when they agreed with Trump to throw the left a bone and let bump stocks die. Bad decision. Slide Fire Solutions closed its doors.

970 2018-06-17 03:11:02 There is something so mischievous about late Ichikawa... He finds an elegance in technical crudity -- the zooms, the fast stocks -- that adds almost a self-parodic dimension to these staid prestige films.

982 2018-06-17 02:47:52 Yeah Initially, I invested $150 and got up to $199. But I made some bad calls and lost some. It allows you to buy only stocks on the Newyork stock exchange thou.

985 2018-06-17 02:46:41 Sounds like a sales pitch. Was hoping for a more personal answer. You tweeted a picture of the book How to make money in stocks. Would you recommend that one? Or not a good read?

993 2018-06-17 02:32:58 Btw in this particular example, it's due to very low liquidity. Focus on liquid stocks. Why? Because institutions can pile huge money into them, holding their ground, which make them easier to trade and hold.

1005 2018-06-17 02:07:38 Bump stocks are a ridiculous novelty item that have been around for years. One pops up in one shooting and everyone loses their minds. He probably hit less people using it. No accuracy
1006 2018-06-17 02:06:09 Back to ideosyncratic security level analysis and systemic risk factors then. But nice to demolish the myth that ‘US stocks are much more expensive than others’
1007 2018-06-17 02:06:05 (stocks up on smoothies and iced coffee)
1008 2018-06-17 02:05:38 Er I think one of the stocks lost like $30. It was like 2007 and I've done some substances since then. Batting 900% the madman!
1009 2018-06-17 02:02:08 I did mostly calendar call spreads on it since the low $30s/high $20s last year. It’s been hugely profitable. But not much more than holding the stocks in retrospect. The waves of parabolic moves really screwed me a few times by missing out. hard to replicate that strategy now
1010 2018-06-17 02:01:39 I be talking about stocks & people just be looking around. Like man I know you know what a stock is.

1012 2018-06-17 02:00:55 The article says in the indented portion that investment bankers were only interested in their fees, not the success of the costumer. This let to many, many people investing in stocks that would fail, increasing the effect of the stick crash.
1013 2018-06-17 02:00:28 Yeah! My food stocks, ammo surplus, water rations, survival books and knowledge, and all that won't mean shit because someone has their PHONE set to 24 hour time instead of 12.
1014 2018-06-17 02:00:25 of course and i dont think people should have bump stocks, eventhough it is possible to bump fire weapons anyways, just even more innacurately than with an already innacurate bump stock
1015 2018-06-17 01:59:19 rushdown form has a command grab with ridiculous range that leaves him +4 on hit and right in his foe's face and stocks up an ex move for zoning form, zoning form can convert his zoning options into a teleport attack that stocks up a run cancel for rushdown form
1016 2018-06-17 01:59:04 3) True—Nothing is being done on the federal level to prevent mass shootings. They still haven’t even banned bump stocks.

1022 2018-06-17 01:55:12 Margin Debt (loans taken against one’s portfolio used to buy more stocks) ticked higher in the latest data release & is hovering near record highs.

1024 2018-06-17 01:55:03 Also there is the point that I have invested in like 10 stocks and none of them have been losers. So yeah batting 1000 percent is pretty good right.

Happy weekend!
1030 2018-06-17 01:49:09 Love this response. I trade players like stocks and have people ragging me all of the time for that strategy.
1031 2018-06-17 01:48:56 Martin Sosnoff, wrote that “the price of a stock varies inversely with the thickness of its research file. The fattest files are found in stocks that are the most troublesome and will decline the furthest . The thinnest files are reserved for those that appreciate the most.”
1032 2018-06-17 01:48:44 And what makes you think they won't? Why not start with some simple thing? - banning bump stocks. Better record-keeping (not like Florida) to keep the mentally ill from purchasing weapons. Overturning drumpf's first EO loosening that restriction. Would any of those hurt so much?
1033 2018-06-17 01:48:08 SEC should investigate Morgan Stanley for purposely misleading public on certain stocks. They repeatedly downgraded micron and amd but silently accumulated both equities to post massive gains.

1036 2018-06-17 01:43:22 The reason melee is beautiful is because quite frequently all 4 stocks could appear in a combo video.  Very very rarely does Smash 4 produce anything combo-video worthy, and it involves a lot of janky stuff that ultimately isn't worth doing to secure victories.

1043 2018-06-17 01:35:39 I always think it’s kinda interesting that this fry/s electronics stocks and sells perfume near the exit...I guess it’s kinda nice, get a ram upgrade and smell nice all in one..
1044 2018-06-17 01:33:12 Use E*TRADE to buy pennystocks. They let you buy almost any security! Robin Hood is basic and they keep traders from buying many of the penny stocks. A majority of penny stock traders use E*TRADE or TD! Hope that helps!
1045 2018-06-17 01:30:52 AMA: "Via a 446-99 vote, the organization also agreed to endorse a ban on assault-type weapons, bump stocks, high-capacity magazines, and armor piercing bullets. It also called for red flag measures that would allow family members and law enforcement to restrict gun ownership"
1046 2018-06-17 01:30:29 I haven’t played Smash competitive in a long time. I want to try the new game on release date, before deciding. However, I am leaning toward 3 stocks.

1050 2018-06-17 01:27:42 The graph is slightly deceiving. We tapped $5,600 in February. Until that support level breaks there's no need for re-analysis or panicking. <2% worldwide adoption, we're experiencing BTCs infancy. Buy signal alerts blaring. #Stocks & #Fiat will soon be #KIA, the suspect, $crypto
1051 2018-06-17 01:26:13 I love bio and I don't even remember TBRA, too many stocks since I suppose!
1052 2018-06-17 01:23:23 I just looked at that account. The person bashes three of the stocks I own. LOL
1053 2018-06-17 01:23:04 They should get more stocks or are they not expecting much sales due to Lotus performance before?
1054 2018-06-17 01:23:02 Pro Stocks will be up right after this last chance race for the sprints.
1055 2018-06-17 01:19:41 Imagine all stocks, all bonds, all bank accounts  …. can't be found and 
you search them. What will you do.. what happens after?

1056 2018-06-17 01:19:18 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1057 2018-06-17 01:19:15 @_nirajshah looking general election next year when I have to start to sell  my stocks? 
My guess is modi govt. Will not get majority seats & we can see nifty at 8000.
Your view on this!
1058 2018-06-17 01:18:27 Who can give me a good time book or article to sell? I always see post saying “don’t get too greedy and take profits ” but then I see post saying “the longer you hold the better, because stocks have drawdowns and people sell too early” #stocks #trading $TWTR #investing #trading
1059 2018-06-17 01:18:21 I'm researching stocks & watching Cubs-Cardinals. I just started investing 2 yrs ago. I learned a few key fundamental terms, like P/E, ROE, P/CF, EBITDA, moving averages, RSI, etc.. If you want safe, start with index funds, esp. in today's volatile mkt. Then find growth stocks.
1060 2018-06-17 01:16:29 Reventaron todos los stocks en el camino. Dilapidaron toda la guita que entró de la super soja, reventaron las reservas del banco central y vos "celebras" que llegaron a puerto? Lamento decirte que luego ese barco volvió a zarpar en iguales condiciones... No arrancamos de nuevo.

1068 2018-06-17 01:04:13 Isn't it ironic when zealous Android fanboys, particularly Samsung ones, slam Apple for being monopolistic when it's Samsung that is dominant in most other markets except the US. Samsung also orders far too many Snapdragon chips, thus resulting to less stocks for others.

1085 2018-06-17 00:34:39 Because most of them are rich enough to afford stocks and stocks are up. It's all about money. The minute anything Trump does affects THEIR bottom line..  they will jump ship.
1086 2018-06-17 00:32:29 The broad market has been in a consolidation for 4 1/2 months. Once the market breaks out of consolidation we'll see many lagging stocks regain their momentum. I would be careful not to overreact to sluggish performance during the consolidation. New highs in EEM & CAT are likely.

1093 2018-06-17 00:20:47 You don't know what you're talking about, most of Europe is socialist to some degree. And capitalism is not about wealth distribution it's about wealth extraction. As can be seen by the 2008 economic collapse and stocks and shares markets.
1094 2018-06-17 00:20:40 As the ruleset heretic I am, I really wanna see Smash Ultimate try out 4 or 5 stocks with Smash Balls on.

1096 2018-06-17 00:19:40 Stocks are rich by any measure.  Are they a bubble?  Depends on definition.  Is a subsequent 25-33 pct drop a bubble?  If it returns to these levels in 5 years?  They are rich.  Discounting rate is increasing.  They will likely go down to make valuations reasonable.  Bubble?  Meh

My exits were not smooth, as both stocks hinted "weakness" - so I elected to take hasty profits. Research begins for new positions. #DwStocks2018

1158 2018-06-16 23:34:57 The killing of Trump supporters at Route 91 in Las Vegas was seen as a sick "bonus" by the perpetrators. The true motive involved shorting MGM stocks, enormous contracts for safety scanners, and to show Trump how serious the deep state is about staying in control. They hate us.

1161 2018-06-16 23:33:09 Investing combined with saving, can really accumulate over the years. There are so many ways to invest, stocks, bonds, realty, startups, cds, ect.

1184 2018-06-16 22:59:51 I also think it would be a nice Father’s Day gift to ban bump stocks and enforce universal background checks.  A great gift to all the fathers that have lost their children to gun violence in America.  #GunReformNow #MarchForOurLives

1189 2018-06-16 22:52:11 @DaveHcontrarian Interesting interview with Jeremy Grantham on Morningstar talking about market's parabolic blow-off potential. I think what he's missing though is that certain segments are already parabolic--see IWO (small-cap growth) and of course FANG stocks.

1193 2018-06-16 22:42:18 To put Scotland's fisheries resource in perspective, not only do we supply up to ~70% of UK fish stocks, we supply the same amount again outside the UK to the EU and elsewhere: that's an overabundance of one type of foodstock of near 20x Scotland's requirements...

Sold out...
1194 2018-06-16 22:42:10 Uhm, many of us got DIRECT checks.  And because we own stock, and the stock prices have gone up, we benefit there, TOO.  Over 60% of Americans own stocks, if you are one of the idiots that doesn't, that's your problem.
1195 2018-06-16 22:41:57 No use investing in a few stocks based on recommendation of securities analysts. Invest in broad portfolios mirroring widely followed indices like ETFs SPY, ACWI & EFA! Ignore stock analysts! An obsolete profession! Burn your CFA certificates!

1227 2018-06-16 21:53:39 That has not happened. DOJ can't make that change. NFA is the law and Bump Stocks were exempt. The law would need to change.
1228 2018-06-16 21:52:47 “Why didn’t you, Trump, ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”

1235 2018-06-16 21:43:48 Maybe because they're the ones in the NRA blocking legislation to make it harder for people to legally obtain a semiautomatic rifle with fun add ons like bump stocks and shoot up schools.

1273 2018-06-16 20:51:39 The stocks been on a “ride”. I bought some in 2008 for $20 a share. I suspect some headwinds on that stock in the near future. The recent fires will not be good PR.
1274 2018-06-16 20:51:05 I may have to build up some more stocks then, just in case
1275 2018-06-16 20:49:15 Have all
1276 2018-06-16 20:48:25 I agree this needs to end. If this happens i say we boycott and stop viewing on youtube and go to the patreons of the creators we love watch them there, and watch youtubes stocks drop. If i wanted to watch TV id turn on comcast not youtube.
1277 2018-06-16 20:47:56 Don’t scan for penny stocks. Better money to be made elsewhere more consistently.

2.0 (lobbying SEC, partnering with Russian gov't).

They're literally bringing back everything we hated about the legacy financial system.
1312 2018-06-16 20:09:28 Niggas know I hold vast amounts of knowledge....that's why y'all always DMing me for shit in regards to stocks, business and IT....but I have no Original Thoughts 
1313 2018-06-16 20:09:03 What about the billions, nay trillions of geese, ducks, deer, cows, pigs and every other creature that man has mercilessly killed for his pleasure every year that he has been here? Stocks are dwindling due to his meddling. Not so with the wolves. Let’s hear it for wolves 
1314 2018-06-16 20:09:01 It's like a Volcano
Ready to Erupt
Hot stocks are like Magma ready to blow
Then the mountain top collapses 
The aftermath unpredictable, the signs ignored
Economy is Volatile, infrastructure unstable!
Government "harvesting" on Volcano mounside
Ignoring Signs!
1315 2018-06-16 20:07:55 "I don't even know, He slapped corrin's butt and that brought her back to life, i said that i'd only like him to do that if she was dead and then he stabbed me!"

"How am I even here?, am I a ghost?.. Am I in a match? how many stocks do I have left?"

He's hyper ventilating...
1316 2018-06-16 20:07:43 @Starbucks how would I go about getting an email contact (or number ) for Starbucks in the Disney village in Paris please? Heading over in a few weeks and would like to order a lot of merch (want to be able to see if they can get the stocks in ready) many thanks 
1317 2018-06-16 20:07:02 Your right It's not, but if they want the poor and middle class to sacrifice their pay for them to buy back their stocks, they should have to sacrifice and listen to the people they're taking advantage of and give raises!! It's that simple!!!
1318 2018-06-16 20:06:46 Lost? I got a pay raise, my stocks are up 20+% and I got my taxes cut.
1319 2018-06-16 20:06:18 Only the demwits that worship Obama. No way that he’s responsible for the growth. I remember what Goldman told us when Trump was elected, market would go down because the stocks were overpriced and the fundamentals were not there. Now they’ve changed that tune.
1320 2018-06-16 20:06:06 I never initiate a #Cannabis conversation. I wait for one to start. I’ll wait to see what direction it goes (med, rec, stocks, science), so I know my audience.  Then join the conversation.  I NEVER use the word cure.  My iPad has all my sources handy when challenged. 1/2

1323 2018-06-16 20:01:20 Fragen Sie die Mücken. Fun fact: Mücken können selbst über ihre Flughöhe entscheiden. Sie hängen nicht an kleinen Fallschirmchen, soncern fliegen aktiv. Auch Bewohner des 5.

1324 2018-06-16 20:00:56 One thing I like about being at work and it being slow is that I can look at which stocks I want to buy next 
1325 2018-06-16 20:00:43 In my opinion if a brand stocks up to a size 32, they shouldnt have a size 12/14 model as the sole representation of their plus size range, especially when said range starts at a size 16.
1326 2018-06-16 19:59:15 I usually keep mine in for two days, three at a push. I’m sure I’ve left it for longer but last year I left it for 4 and it had started to ferment so I left it. Or you could turn into wine. There’s an elderflower champagne that’s quite easy too...

1330 2018-06-16 19:56:16 Trump supporters are the laughing stocks who are claiming to be Christian ppl and have obviously got some type of mental issues as well
1331 2018-06-16 19:55:43 Why didn’t you ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearms to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?
1332 2018-06-16 19:55:05 If you truly believe your thesis is true, then a drop is a time to purchase more. HOWEVER #stocks have no personality, no memory, and don’t know if they’re a good price or a bad price. So you have to make an analytical decision and stick to a strategy.
1333 2018-06-16 19:53:36 Battleground stocks have players on both sides with much more than mere money at stake. Not having to disclose position, entry, and exit is a huge advantage, which we lose with every tweet. Investors are a lot less rational than they'd like to believe.
1334 2018-06-16 19:52:21 Je savais que le contrecoup allait être féroce, mais là, je suis vidée. Je regarde des photos de la saison 3 de Lucifer, je me fais des stocks d'images pour les futurs wps et j'attends l'heure d'aller au dodo #Lucifersaved... j'ai encore du mal à y croire.
1335 2018-06-16 19:51:09 How about instead of a progressive tax, a CEO/owner cannot make more than 10x the lowest paid worker. If the CEO gets 100 shares of stocks, the receptionist gets at least 10. That guarantees the money actually trickles down
1336 2018-06-16 19:50:13 I’ve seen some.  Stocks is still capitalism lol.  How do you think companies control the markets? By denying others/ overcharging.
1337 2018-06-16 19:49:17 What's your 401k/pension/IRA looking like u got CDs u in stocks & bonds? But u wanna get married right?
1338 2018-06-16 19:48:54 When stocks like $DBX pop 20% in two days with relatively low short interest why not?
1339 2018-06-16 19:48:49 This uses double the sugar I used and mine already tastes like liquid sugar. I think I definitely needed to keep the flowers in for longer.

1346 2018-06-16 19:35:40 Trump is the best president ever!
1347 2018-06-16 19:35:27 Changing strategy. Given the market situation and upcoming events in 2019, it is better to go for steady compounders and less risky stocks. Not the right time to search for multi-baggers.A PF compounding at 20-25-% can create serious wealth over long term.
1348 2018-06-16 19:35:25 It seems very similar to mine, maybe they pay more attention to sterilisation than I do

1355 2018-06-16 19:30:01 To be honest, the entire stockmarket doesn't look that inviting to invest. Especially the tech stocks, how high can they go?
1356 2018-06-16 19:29:47 also right --> insider selling isn't always bad... 

but --> how many s&p 500 stocks have CEO's WITHOUT skin in the game?

1360 2018-06-16 19:25:21 same happened to me. in ‘17 im turned 35 and bull market helped do 20x (could have much more, but i did closed most position too early) and ended ‘17 with net worth of 2.7m+stocks
1361 2018-06-16 19:20:47 Not gonna lie when I got your notification I was so confused, I was like what stocks is cynthia trying to buy?
1362 2018-06-16 19:18:20 Solid long term investment. Stocks rising.
1363 2018-06-16 19:16:37 Peasant stocks?
1364 2018-06-16 19:16:25 Roth IRA are great: you can deposit funds that are already taxed. Depending who you decide to open the account with: you can invest the funds into stocks, bonds, etc.

1367 2018-06-16 19:14:26 Sorry to keep blowing u up lol but why in the world would they de list stocks? They make percentages off every trade. More mediums of exchange more opportunity for revenue. Plus NYSE Has such a presence in the stock market? Adding crypto is one thing. Taking out stocks= not yet
1368 2018-06-16 19:12:08 yeah... i read that too... those are words...

1376 2018-06-16 19:03:39 Your right, they should have made it mandatory for employees raises BEFORE they could get the tax savings, ESPECIALLY when big companies were saying they wouldn't be giving raises they would be buying back their stocks!!
1377 2018-06-16 19:03:37 Let the momo stocks run once the emotions are settled after 30 mins of market open.. you will see the trend and can do more managed trades
1378 2018-06-16 19:03:27 I’m sure he has some stocks he can move around.
1379 2018-06-16 19:02:44 How about banning bump stocks and enacting common sense gun control so our kids don’t get shot by white male Americans in our schools

1383 2018-06-16 18:59:15 Hitting tariffs on all nations is maximizing US stocks. Causing world stocks to drop. Who gets rich out of this? Matching tariffs dollar by dollar prevents this from happening. Trump has stocks.

1386 2018-06-16 18:54:53 thank you for your recent article quoting the @SookeCa @MajaTait @Pearskw who are promoting MORE local fishing to diminish and terminate our #Sooke fish stocks. Totally irresponsible.
1387 2018-06-16 18:54:28 Nearly 600 wounded and 58 killed in Vegas by one sick individual allowed to buy 17 assault rifles, bump stocks and 10,000 rounds of ammo.
1388 2018-06-16 18:54:16 .Take their guns, and they'll turn the dicks into fully automatic bump stocks.
1389 2018-06-16 18:53:35 Will be interesting. Extremely high short interest stocks have been squeezing all year, ex. $RH. Seems to me the analyst is late on the downgrade near the lows, see this over and over again. They could also accelerate their share repurchase program. $BITA

1400 2018-06-16 18:47:27 So much for the tax break. Wages aren’t going up. Companies are buying back stocks. Nothing is going towards helping the workers. Government borrowing is up. Deficit is skyrocketing. Dotard a horrible business man, delusional, emotionally bankrupt, grifter.

1404 2018-06-16 18:46:07 That’s not answering my question. What would they have to gain tangibly from not calling this game a port of Smash 4? Would their sales decrease? Would their stocks plummet? Would Sakurai have to console every crying fanboy on the street?
1405 2018-06-16 18:44:21 Don’t you have anything positive to say?  You keep posting this, worded differently each time, to stir up the Trump supporters who refuse to check facts. What about white gangs?  What about the white men who have perpetrated mass shootings with assault rifles & bump stocks?
1406 2018-06-16 18:44:07 @comcast  you NEED a partnership with @Sony run it by the board,you want to REALLY compete with @netflix don’t you? Imagine if you had a deal with @PlayStation? Like I said before,am going to need a cut and some stocks,also I got more ideas. #notjustacustomeranymore

1414 2018-06-16 18:34:20 Yep, they blatantly told the American people they were going to buy stocks back for the shareholders, not give raises or hire a bunch more people!! They said that BEFORE it was voted on, so the GOP can't say they didn't know the companies were gonna do that, we were all told!!
1415 2018-06-16 18:33:53 All Giuliani and Trump has to do was stay small time NY schemers and they would be sitting pretty. Now international laughing stocks.

1441 2018-06-16 18:07:20 I mean I had a ruler out charting high and low of each day on actual paper. I don’t even remember what stocks I picked. Had to be stuff I’d heard of. At that time I was reading Forbes, Newsweek, Time - I had subscriptions.
1442 2018-06-16 18:07:03 I left the flowers in boiling water overnight, strained then boiled it with sugar and lemon and acid. It’s not bad, but doesn’t taste of a great deal. Do you just leave the flowers or boil them?
1443 2018-06-16 18:06:38 Two in the stag weekend alone for me, we should buy stocks in shoes! 
1444 2018-06-16 18:05:26 jsjs i hope if bh goes public the boys surely buy stocks in it so that they're at least shareholders
1445 2018-06-16 18:04:34 Didn’t know of stop losses at the time. I never traded anything before crypto and I’m 48. I did at age 17 buy some Forbes stock market course. Picked 6 stocks and religiously charted their progress for 6 months without buying. Lost 50% there too  Learning from you guys though!
1446 2018-06-16 17:58:37 best pods no doubt omg
1447 2018-06-16 17:56:42 We calculate GDP with stock market values and most of all stock is owned by 1%. Stocks are Gross , but not domestic and produce nothing.
1448 2018-06-16 17:56:33 Which among the liquor stocks do you find attractive at this moment?..in terms of valuation as well as profitability on account of falling molasses prices.
1449 2018-06-16 17:54:52 when it comes to Real Estate always Buy! Invest in Real Estate, Stocks, and Bonds. @PropertyProNG @LagosTalks913
1450 2018-06-16 17:54:04 there should be taxes on stocks.  there are taxes on homes, taxes on the car you take to work, even taxes on books in a lawyer's office.  there are taxes on used goods already taxed.  this curve shows lots of money to tax, and not the capital gains inherited basis scam, either
1451 2018-06-16 17:53:58 Americans do have a long-history of public shaming/heckling. Hence the stocks in the village square. Not that its right, but its not new.
1452 2018-06-16 17:52:31 Hi Barry. Thought id chime in on this. The president our our company has a client from JP Morgan Private Wealth. Their fees were high and their advisor had the client in 100 different stocks. Comical and sad how non fiduciaries work.
1453 2018-06-16 17:51:52 @AnilSinghviZEE has a good sense of rumour while discussing the stocks which lightens the moment. Keep it up . @iamrakeshbansal @kunalsaraogi
1454 2018-06-16 17:51:10 Yea theres more stocks, commodities and options than currency pairs but these return yields are like 2-10% if you’re good as opposed to 5.3 trillion dollars a day all off of your phone in a community that everyone can eat in but if it’s all preference 
1455 2018-06-16 17:51:08 @ronaksanghvi123 
Bro apart from DMART ! Is there any good stocks to invest for a Long term so that we can get a good half return when compare to DMart
1456 2018-06-16 17:49:02 Idk how it turned into stocks vs forex but forex will always be a better for trading where stocks are more for long investments and a focus on our demographic most students can’t afford to sit on shares for weeks, months as opposed to scalping in minutes and makes 20x the money
1457 2018-06-16 17:48:40 I hate the blind hate miis get. People claim they're busted when only Small mii brawler was and that debatable when we allow ZSS, meta knight, Bayo, and others stay knowing that they can take away stocks in a heartbeat. Free the Miis! They need justice!!!
1458 2018-06-16 17:47:56 Cotton going up in stocks for sure
1459 2018-06-16 17:46:47 Maybe I don't listen to same news as you, but what things are going terribly wrong? Economy and stocks are good and there's progress with North Korea. Those are really important things even if other stuff is not great
1460 2018-06-16 17:46:24 Thanks Could you please help me out from where i can get stocks whose CCI(8) is ngeative but CCI(W/M) is above 100 so that i can enter that stock.
1461 2018-06-16 17:46:10 Sundar sir reply was good instead of blocking
1462 2018-06-16 17:46:09 Yes it does smell like old trainers... but tastes delicious. Did you boil it? I usually dissolve sugar and citric acid in boiling water then put the elderflowers in afterwards, if it’s boiling it can discolour the flowers (they look good though!)
1463 2018-06-16 17:45:56 Ask Mr Pres a direct question - why did he come to parkland and promise to ban bump stocks and raise the age to 21 and 4 months later nothing ??the executive order for Universal background checks ? The exec order for funding for 1 armed guard per every 1000 kids ?
1464 2018-06-16 17:45:46 To any and all designers that see this, do y’all know a good source for 2D assets, stocks, images, etc?
1465 2018-06-16 17:42:34 I felt bad for the crew vs us like 2 of those poor kids got 0 stocks lmao
1466 2018-06-16 17:42:29 This is exactly what I have been trying to explain.  All three US U Mining stocks:  UEC, URG, and UUUU are in the sweet spot and are being noted and targeted.  So, stake a position, feel confident, and sit back and watch.  Also, since Funds want to be early they are sniffing now.

1468 2018-06-16 17:39:24 Obama took over the recession Bush put us in & saved the economy but you people shit on him. Trump inherited a great economy, low unemployment, high stocks, everything good & he's destroying it. YOU OWN THIS! You don't get to blame the Dem that is going to have to fix the mess!
1469 2018-06-16 17:39:10 There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks. 131
1470 2018-06-16 17:38:34 Weeeeeeell, yes and no.
Price increase on the existing inventory.

My suppliers hunt with fullauto-bump stocks so I got shit tons of them.

1471 2018-06-16 17:36:49 Great point, all those wealthy Americans who’s wealth is wrapped up in stocks and other investments... it’s just so hard to cash a dividend check, certainly keeps them motivated doesn’t it.
1472 2018-06-16 17:36:42 Thank you, Donny! Looking forward to #MAGA with you!
1473 2018-06-16 17:36:26 Penny stocks.
1474 2018-06-16 17:35:47 Well worth the effort. I'm a big fan of slow cooking generally. When I make a curry or stew it takes 6 hours. 8 hours for tomato and basil pasta sauce. I also make my own stocks, takes 24 hours. The hardest part is smelling it and having to wait, but it's worth it in the end.
1475 2018-06-16 17:35:19 Hey, does anyone know where in London stocks the @IrishTimes on Saturdays?
1476 2018-06-16 17:35:10 Hi Thomas, unfortunately neither the Hull or York store stocks this item, if you would like to see it stocked in your store, you can request it at the customer service desk as I do not believe they are available online. Thanks- Lee
1477 2018-06-16 17:32:57 Keeping stocks afloat seems pretty much coordinated lol
1478 2018-06-16 17:32:13 I agree changing the ticker symbol word greatly increase the stock price. However, #Bashers would so  point out that it could make the company weaker because it doesn’t include profits from the other subsidiaries.  

Bears  use any excuse they can to lie, bash, & manipulate!
1479 2018-06-16 17:32:08 News always come later chart shows it was goin to have pullback...infact all pharma stocks...but it wont break recent low

1486 2018-06-16 17:29:26 One thing I hate about stocks is that so many execs collect such huge salaries. I don't want to pay some guy $20 million a year. As a shareholder, you do exactly that.
1487 2018-06-16 17:27:48 Imagine if rappers spit rhymes about stocks and 401ks instead of hoes, drugs, and excessive luxuries.
1488 2018-06-16 17:27:11 On Q on fishery, Scott Simms says: I’m not going to quote John Crosbie but you know where I’m going. I can’t replenish the cod stocks. #cbcnl
1489 2018-06-16 17:26:50 Arron Banks 17 July 2016 tweet:
'I am buying gold at the moment & big mining stocks'.

Russia has been amassing as much gold as possible in a bid to outmanoeuvre the US in a silent economic war. So what did Yakovenko tell Banks over that 'boozy lunch'?
1490 2018-06-16 17:26:48 Caution and skepticism are the operative words that should be in investor's mind, especially today, before investing. The continuous random risk events weekly, or more often, should help you go to the sidelines.#stocks#risk#wsj#ft

1493 2018-06-16 17:25:43 You’re too caught up in conspiracy thoughts. I’ll get concerned when I see massive money going in to stocks and out of bonds.
1494 2018-06-16 17:24:29 i moved my buy / hold stocks over to US before trump won :) ha ha ha ha ha
1495 2018-06-16 17:23:03 Minny:  Also, if you were one of the new sector IPOs or Funds sniffing around and you know during "every" U3O8 bull run stocks like UEC go up 5 to 20X+ easily wouldn't you consider making a move? We know 3 IPOs will be funded w 100s of millions soon. Now is the time 2 buy & hold.
1496 2018-06-16 17:22:50 MANY businesses are making MILLIONS of $'s off these children being abducted. Bet a paper trail of companies, money trail would lead back to those with ownership, part-ownership and/or stocks in these companies to the WH and the clown running the travesty.
1497 2018-06-16 17:20:05 Attention, Walmart shoppers! Corporate profits are at record highs, but stocks are languishing. Investors may be looking forward and not in a positive way. Trump’s unilateral tariffs and trade wars are the likely cause. IOW, expect your investments to suffer as prices rise.
1498 2018-06-16 17:19:13 Norway is not part of the EU or its common fisheries policy (CFP), it manages and controls its own waters and fish stocks. So when free of the EU we could do a deal for mutual access. Yet another reason to LEAVE!!!!!!!
1499 2018-06-16 17:19:08 16th of June, Chinese stocks are going up and I'm coming down with some new Asian virus
Ju Ju man, Ju Ju man
Doc says you're fine, or dying Please
1500 2018-06-16 17:18:29 BINGO! If you noticed about 2 weeks ago I said that the short pos towards UEC was 8.8% & was 2-5X other sector stocks. Most are betting opposite of me. So, IPOs, sector heating up, Funds, Spot done, 232, hi Short % so Nov CALLS look nice. UEC has 2 huge Catalysts in hand too.
1501 2018-06-16 17:15:49 Also, more black & Hispanic workers...than EVER, GDP 4+%, stocks up roughly 40%, we are almost at FULL EMPLOYMENT and that has NEVER happened. We could keep going but theyre6happy to have their heads in the sand, poor bastards.
1502 2018-06-16 17:15:42 It's a cliche, but I hope you'll invest in penny stocks to treat your chronic fatigue
1503 2018-06-16 17:15:24 Get TRON and hodl and get some marijuana stocks.  Both are about to soar in price!

1506 2018-06-16 17:12:26 To be honest, I own a boat-load of ethanol stocks. 
I'm wondering if he's going to sell it to DPRK or China to appease the corn/ethanol constituents.
Ya hope

1513 2018-06-16 17:04:33 As you might guess, I'm still thinking about the best way to respond to your point about stocks vs flows. (Which is a point that goes beyond Keynes' GT.)
1514 2018-06-16 17:03:16 As I review @MarketSmith #Stocks with RS Line at New High, I'm noticing if I would've used close < 50 DMA on daily as stop I would still be long most of the ones I traded from this list the past few months.  I need to trade names on this list better.  $STUDY
1515 2018-06-16 17:02:11 madami sila stocks? in case magka pimple ako hahaha
1516 2018-06-16 17:01:25 We gotta get you trading penny stocks......
1517 2018-06-16 16:59:44 It's usually the newbies playing with emotion that cannot hold an adult conversation. This stock has potential like no other stock in the market right now. There literally changing a business.... CEO needs to make ipo for movie pass
1518 2018-06-16 16:59:14 @KarmaBull should have reduce your margin exposure kept the name . Because you feel much more in pain if stocks goes to 95 to 100 year end
1519 2018-06-16 16:57:34 Spending a week in NYC with family, I can't wait to go back to work tomorrow. Markets are in good bull shape - Pot stock positions look bullish - once again we have to embrace the volatility of these pot stocks - there are a lot of player changes in these stocks...
1520 2018-06-16 16:57:34 #Commodities #steel #stock 

Steel price is moving up worldwide! #China Stocks coming down for #Billet + #Rebar and  #IronOre stocks in 44 chinese ports started to decline for second week! 
#CIS index and #Scrap also moving up along with #CokingCoal!
A very good week ahead!
1521 2018-06-16 16:57:18 I think the tiers would change heavily. But thwn theyd become pretty static after the flip. 3 stocks equals more consistency.
I cant imagine we would have had upsets like TLTC>Zero. Or Hikarus Civil war run in a 3 stock meta
1522 2018-06-16 16:55:55 Nah. I agree with some mid tiers like villager and ness coming up. And with bayo coming down. But Dk Bowser Luigi. These chars rely HEAVILY on taking fast stocks with minimum neutral interaction. The tier list would split in two.
Chars with neutral
Chars that avoid it
1523 2018-06-16 16:55:49 Like the like oil stocks in 2015. I did quite well on those. Could have been better with a little more courage!
1524 2018-06-16 16:55:04 You can work the same amount and be more productive. I'm not surprised that CEO's work is insanely more valuable than the lowest-tier worker.
But also: CEO salaries got inflated after laws requiring salary transparency, because companies wanted to appear successful for stocks.
1525 2018-06-16 16:53:42 Hard disagree, if Smash 4 was 3 stocks it would give the midtiers MORE chances to rise because the midtiers are the ones that can jank. The tip tiers would drop to their level
1526 2018-06-16 16:53:27 Invest in Penny stocks....Thank me later #FamilyWealth
1527 2018-06-16 16:53:18 There is no point in making themselves laughing Stocks, in the eyes of Public.
Every body knows truth abt Kejriwal, he has done from day one as CM.
If at all they want to help him, they must suggest him to apologize to Chief Secy of Delhi, whom he confined & assaulted at CM Res.
1528 2018-06-16 16:52:43 Given there are only a few hundred there they couldn't have had decent stocks. Any decent supplier would slightly over order to be certain, people always drink more than anticipated.
1529 2018-06-16 16:52:34 That tax cut will allow companies to invest in themselves and NOT the workers. Giving CEO's more money to purchase their own stocks rather than increasing wages will do nothing for the workers. You are on the wrong side of history.
1530 2018-06-16 16:52:32 Love these tweets! I used to be great at letting stocks ride until the market volatility changed. Really messed with my mental and I began taking profits where I could. Now, I’m struggling to let things ride again and have missed out on some great continuations $W $RH
1531 2018-06-16 16:50:31 Wait! That’s false. 50-55 percent, of Americans are currently not investing in the stock market—either by buying individual stocks or mutual funds, or through a retirement account such as a 401(k) or IRA. It’s his half of the population that suffers greatly under this economy.
1532 2018-06-16 16:49:39 I can get behind lower corp.taxes if all corporations pay their employees fair wages to live on. That doesn’t happen. USA cuts their taxes and all the shareholders buy more stocks. How does that help people and the economy? Money should be circulated not concentrated at the top.
1533 2018-06-16 16:49:04 Followed and retweeted! Thank you GeanineC!! 
1534 2018-06-16 16:47:53 What will happen to stocks
1535 2018-06-16 16:46:44 Put them in stocks on the town square for a week and then to the guillotine!
1536 2018-06-16 16:45:03 The right thing to do would be to put them in the stocks and let fans pelt them with rotten vegetables, but that’s just one guy’s opinion
1537 2018-06-16 16:45:02 Ban "military style" semiautomatic rifles, bump stocks, high capacity clips.

You get your hunting rifles, handguns for "protection," shotguns... W/ background checks, documentation at every point of sale, proficiency for license, insurance, harsh penalties for breaking gun law.
1538 2018-06-16 16:44:53 Bump stocks are hacks to get around the prohibition of the sale of machine guns to citizens.
That is, only the military and police forces can legally use machine guns.
1539 2018-06-16 16:44:18 I love waking up every morning and checking how my stocks are doing 
1540 2018-06-16 16:43:58 I’ve known for a while Grant, I just enjoy a moan about it every time I use it. My local supplier stocks F&B, not once have I ever heard offered or been asked if I want the primer with my emulsion. Standard Macphersons & tikurilla covers in 2, third of the price.
1541 2018-06-16 16:41:39 Ah hmmm.  Where does #CNN fit into all of this? And how do I make #money on #stocks  based on  #POTUS decisions?
1542 2018-06-16 16:41:36 As far as we know now, the bear market in stocks (i.e. $SPX) might have begun in January 2018

C’est un peu (beaucoup) naze comme bilan. 2/2
1545 2018-06-16 16:36:52 Sounds like a wonderful idea. But dad a couple extra stocks of AMD or Twitter. 
1546 2018-06-16 16:36:35 i would never wish for even my worst enemy to take 0 stocks in a crew battle
1547 2018-06-16 16:35:26 US Steel is the only industry that likes this plan.  I'm sure they love it.  Their stocks are at an all time high. The ones that hate them are: Construction and architecture, US auto and boat makers, Breweries (think kegs, kettles, cans), retailers, machine manufacturers.
1548 2018-06-16 16:35:22 @iamrakeshbansal what according to you should be the level to re-enter into pharma stocks Dr Reddy Glen mark sunpharma
1549 2018-06-16 16:33:52 You could extend the logic and say investing in shares is crap look at Unitech and JP. There are other stocks and other cities too
1550 2018-06-16 16:33:06 Seth main-evented Mania vs. Brock and Roman. And Won. Minus Braun, everyone you mentioned has been world champion and Braun won the Greatest Royal Rumble. Batista coming back for a few months won't really hurt their stocks and he is a Legend capable of putting people over.
1551 2018-06-16 16:31:35 I think at around +30 stocks (obviously broad ranging), you are in systematic risk territory vs non-systematic/ idiosyncratic risk,  correct?
1552 2018-06-16 16:30:56 It's surprising that rubber prices are 10-15% lower but tyre stocks are not rejoicing ,jk tyre looks undervalued ,it's also a provider to Maruti so should do well
1553 2018-06-16 16:29:41 You would think so how fanboys talk but the only time I have seen CEO's spend 24/7 on the front line is with penny stocks because the CEO is the only employee the company has.
1554 2018-06-16 16:28:37 It's the fucking legal guns that kills American kids, insted of spending $100B on a wall that won't stop anything, start by banning AR-15's and bump stocks like you promised!

1557 2018-06-16 16:27:34 Nauna pa yung black shoes ko sa uniform.. 2 weeks pa daw bago makuha eh. Ang bilis maubos ng stocks at ang tagal magrestock sa school and aa Baro so galaw galaw na me since 2 weeks lang palugit magcivillian
1558 2018-06-16 16:26:46 @realDonaldTrump 
Hickory Dickory dock. Stop sucking the NRAs cock!!! Do run reform!!! You already said you would ban bump stocks, why haven’t you done that?
1559 2018-06-16 16:25:23 Once out of index, stocks outperform, so long as industry is alive.
1560 2018-06-16 16:24:45 With so many stocks up in their patterns, do we see any other groups setting up here for a new leg up? A topic for this weekend's Gilmo Report. Got Gilmo???
1561 2018-06-16 16:23:10 Followed all I was not already following.
1562 2018-06-16 16:21:58 Pot stocks maybe?
1563 2018-06-16 16:21:38 Mini BackPack! LIMITED STOCKS.

1564 2018-06-16 16:21:13 Might be premiums would not correct but these stocks could go in for time correction
1565 2018-06-16 16:20:56 lets go, bagpi tiangge. sobrang daming tiangge sa taytay mahihilo ka sa kakaikot, but may isa ako na fave dun, halos lahat ng items 100-130 pesos lang every thurday and monday kasi un ung dating ng mga stocks nila, bagsakan kumbaga.
1566 2018-06-16 16:20:49 I am vegetarian..and don't invest in stocks which are in nonveg businesses.... Ample way to make money ...and lot of money
1567 2018-06-16 16:19:49 Islands of stability are looking more unstable with these premiums. Too much money chasing too little quality stocks
1568 2018-06-16 16:17:45 ETFs have a prominent place in a portfolio but in accounts over $250k you need to own stocks to ever make any real money. If you own basically all the stocks in the world. You’re destined for mediocre returns.

1570 2018-06-16 16:17:05 Once the high beta (last bastion of #FOMO ) stocks hit a wall then the market is going to come down hard
1571 2018-06-16 16:16:50 I spoke to the Patients association this week and they assured me that this is a pattern of behaviour....defensive which then becomes offensive.  Can hardly believe it.  Why do they make such awful allegations against the vulnerable and bereaved.  Put them in the stocks!!
1572 2018-06-16 16:13:20 True but some of these stocks are getting out of hand LOL. Just like $FB those SOB haven’t updated their website since like 2011 and they’re breaking ATHs no complaining about the opportunities though
1573 2018-06-16 16:13:17 OUTERTECH CIRCLE stocks rallying
1574 2018-06-16 16:13:04 All this trade war talk hasn’t hurt the markets in June...  been a huge month. Don’t understand how people have only ETF portfolios. No alpha opportunities in stocks. How boring.
1575 2018-06-16 16:12:06 I’m not super educated on economics. Just got a little knowledge and some common sense but we are complaining about a few cents lower hourly wage when a stock market is doing well. We should remember this is a plus because a lot of retirement is in stocks. So we are making more $
1576 2018-06-16 16:09:12 Holding Ground

Of the 31 Sensex stocks, 18 have been a part of the index for the last decade. Their combined weight has declined by 160 bps to 77.7%. Among the heavyweights, Reliance Inds weight has dropped by 6.3 %age points, while HDFC Bank’s increased by 8.3 percentage point.
1577 2018-06-16 16:08:55 Most charities keep the money n give 1% to the actual cause n do nothing with the money accept gamble it on stocks  people have lost faith giving money hundreds off millons   Each year and seeing no changes check sport relief comic relief still nothing has changed NEW ADS NEEDED
1578 2018-06-16 16:08:51 Buying stocks at this level is unlikely to beat even fixed income returns over next 10 years.Most investors are not contrarians and would suffer from recency bias.They would buy stocks which have done well over the last 2-3 years and pay a price for it.
1579 2018-06-16 16:08:38 So counteract by buying stocks?
1580 2018-06-16 16:08:11 Thanks bro! No stocks 
1581 2018-06-16 16:07:40 Very true!!!  
1582 2018-06-16 16:07:38 Metals Rise

Vedanta’s inclusion will ramp up the metal sector’s weight by 130 bps — less than 50 percent of what it was six years ago. Two stocks will represent the sector after nearly three years, the other being Tata Steel Ltd.
1583 2018-06-16 16:06:51 I know I was just so fast and so good that you didn't even see me. You just couldn't keep up and saw your stocks go down.
1584 2018-06-16 16:06:18 My stocks just went up should I cash out while I'm up
1585 2018-06-16 16:05:45 #IfMomsRanTheMafia Our Gun stocks would smell like Lemon Pledge
1586 2018-06-16 16:05:19 I’ve notice that you have shut up about how good the economy is now that you’re SCROTUS, is it because Stocks have taken a triple-digit drop? So much WIN!!!
1587 2018-06-16 16:04:32 There are many other tech evolving not just blockchain but this last accessible to all the people. No one with expertise will buy stocks for a company with market cap over 10B and no product on regular exchange

1590 2018-06-16 16:02:03 you need to take it in a consistent preparation like you would medicine. if the chemical consistency is always different you can never find your baseline, thus never know how much to increase or decrease your dose. look for a dispensary that always stocks 1 kind
1591 2018-06-16 16:01:15 The same people may invest in stocks/real estate with no real understanding of the dynamics of those complex adaptive markets.  

They're just more legible: "It's a house", "It's Coca-Cola", etc.
1592 2018-06-16 16:01:10 They are still beholden to people with stocks who have voting shares, shareholders already get a voice by buying/selling in response to the companies actions.

1594 2018-06-16 15:59:23 131. There are a number of factors discouraging us from investing in stocks.
1595 2018-06-16 15:57:06 count me in!
1596 2018-06-16 15:56:29 Ridiculous request. Flip it round: get same scientists to proclaim your development industry has zero risk/impact...Or get some scientists to quantify the actual impact of farms...They only speak of ‘risk’. Quantify mortality rates on specific runs/stocks then get back to us
1597 2018-06-16 15:56:19 Our corporations are about to become victims of a trade war? 

Good thing Trump just stuffed them full of repatriated cash and gave them massive tax cuts. That'll take some of the sting out of it.

Don't buy back stocks. Build factories.
China can watch the tide roll back out.
1598 2018-06-16 15:55:35 Watching this country implode is not nearly as entertaining as was promised. Motherfuckers cannot have a discussion without someone screaming for the other to be put into the stocks and publicly shamed for their opposing opinions. Fuck you and your narratives.

1605 2018-06-16 15:49:21 Fundamentals analysis direct you to stocks which have the financials to improve returns. The StokPix FA takes its data from the annual report over various time periods and completes analysis to predict which parts of a company’s fundamentals are related to stock price increases.

1607 2018-06-16 15:46:13 If your trading hasn't improved in the last few years then you should look yourself at the mirror, the reflection of that person is the one that is causing all the problem, master your mind and then you can master your trading. #daytrading #trading #tradingpsychology #stocks
1608 2018-06-16 15:45:30 Urging my mutual funds to dump your stocks as long as you continue to imprison children who have been kidnapped from their parents. You are supposed to be a defense contractor. This weakens America.

1616 2018-06-16 15:41:49 Looks like you're putting tariffs on our allies to tank the stock market so your kids and your rich buddies and CEOs can buy cheap stocks and make a fortune when the market recovers.  Then you glorify dictators and lift sanctions from our enemies.   Ripping kids from their family
1617 2018-06-16 15:40:47 Nasty! Millennials Vandalized My Blue Chip Stocks !!
1618 2018-06-16 15:40:20 Yes. If options were like stocks and didn't burn premium they'd be the greatest wealth maker in history. Premium burn is what kills most options
1619 2018-06-16 15:40:20 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon arounda
1620 2018-06-16 15:39:59 The stocks are insanely well-coached folks just ridiculously well coached
1621 2018-06-16 15:39:47 @Assimalhakeem Please I want purchase some shares in  Telecom company, is it permissible. Is shares or stocks an aspect of Riba?
1622 2018-06-16 15:39:30 How many companies are leaving the US and laying people off after their massive tax cut? Stocks are up because companies are buying back their own stocks. ISIS is still alive & well. NK gave up nothing significant while the "deal maker" gave Kim everything he asked for.
1623 2018-06-16 15:39:23 The idea that all stocks are gambling is a really harmful outlook that people have been passing around imo. Its just a fear tactic started somewhere. Its why so many don't invest at all. You can make safe investments. If it was all gambling you'd see a lot more bankruptcy

1626 2018-06-16 15:35:18 Ah...Will stick to my mining stocks, and, now with China trade war pretty much guaranteeing economic troubles, maybe make some profits. Big maybe.
1627 2018-06-16 15:35:06 Very true....same is happening right now with power sector...once EV and charging infra will boom, stocks will touch sky...
1628 2018-06-16 15:33:51 Also while stocks are never a promise, only way S&P 500 all belly up is the end of the USA so at that point cash will be useless too lol
1629 2018-06-16 15:32:44 I'm bullish on this, but a realist also, block if you must but, the SEC doesn't lie about dilution. Are some shorts to blame aldi, of course but dilution has a hand in it also.
1630 2018-06-16 15:32:30 Time to start investing into these stocks, small businesses, and estates
1631 2018-06-16 15:31:33 Oh I’m not saying Apple isn’t full of afterthoughts. (Hi, Mac mini.) But given how “all in” they are on Stocks, News etc and that we lost the “i” in iBooks, I’d not be surprised if Books didn’t show up in a later beta is all. Though why Stocks was a priority.... ?!
1632 2018-06-16 15:30:18 Where is the proof of dilution?

I think it would be best if I block you.. you should just like a short-bear with NO FACTS!

1635 2018-06-16 15:29:02 I blame dilution for its poor performance, and that is directly correlated with management
1636 2018-06-16 15:29:00 Stocks certainly have intrinsic value. You legally own a piece of a company. Antiques? Other than cars, not much. Crypto coins have zero intrinsic value. There is no underlying asset to a virtual coin.
1637 2018-06-16 15:28:55 I understand and share in your frustration.. let’s make sure to point the blame in the right direction!! 

Mitch and Ted cannot focus on share price every moment of the day.. we can do our best to help other investors know what the facts are!
1638 2018-06-16 15:28:32 Bring in the stocks and firing squad.
1639 2018-06-16 15:28:14 I am not a one most of the time,  but it has been a very tough year for contrarians. Long value stocks, Short nifty 30 and FANG and you suffer.

1651 2018-06-16 15:18:14 Think new money, not old money. Those who made a lot of money on stocks, real estate or cryptocurrencies and are competitive and adventurous. And it’ll take smart dealmaking survivalists, not manic-depressive loners to be successful there.

1663 2018-06-16 15:08:06 There’s never any rush to invest ur hard money in stocks. If you do at elevated levels you could be underwater for decades.

1664 2018-06-16 15:06:48 Exactly!  Income tax is supposed to be a tax on the gain from sales and stocks, not on wages.  Yet, here we are getting taxed to the nth degree.  I'm sick of paying 1/3 of my income to these Bozo's who spend it so easily and in the same breath tell me I need to save for retiremt.

1671 2018-06-16 14:54:30 The fact that people CAN make millions trading stocks has helped create the #GigEconomy. After all, if people with money can make millions (or billions) trading stocks, why go to the trouble/risk of starting new businesses and employing people. Heck, that's actual WORK!

1679 2018-06-16 14:48:53 @IBDinvestors why do stocks still going up get dropped from the IBD50 list. Like STMP was 18, then 13 and now gone even though it's still moving up?
1680 2018-06-16 14:48:26 And then put in the stocks? A punishment he would probably appreciate as he comes from that period.

1697 2018-06-16 14:35:04 Same to you zafar bhai,
1698 2018-06-16 14:34:55 Of course. I mean.. stocks, bonds, mortgages, securities get traded, don't they? There's somehow this notion that [X] being a security will make it extinct or something. It's amusing to see people scared / relieved.
1699 2018-06-16 14:33:19 I don't know what they made but I feel sure that they have plenty of stocks and other things in their portfolio that earns major money.

1703 2018-06-16 14:30:11 China said it will retaliate against the Trump administration's plan to impose a 25% tariff on $50 billion in Chinese imports. Stocks posted modest losses on the news.
1704 2018-06-16 14:29:31 He shot himself. Lone wolf. No discernible motivation. Bump-stocks are bad. No family or friends involved. His internet activity wiped. His computer hard drive "lost". Fuzzy facts. Virtually nothing on video despite being a Vegas hotel. Police response time was inexcusable. Yeah.

1706 2018-06-16 14:27:46 @BeerOClockShow how lucky am I. Local Coop now stocks Jaipur however the price wouldn't scan cashier let me have them £1.50 each.
1707 2018-06-16 14:27:28 This is actually something i might try. Think i need to get used to the stocks moving 20-50 cent without getting nervous about it.
1708 2018-06-16 14:26:14 I love that your charting stocks also.
1709 2018-06-16 14:25:52 It’s a complicated structure. Maxim’s Caterers Limited is half owned by Hongkong Caterers Limited, the shareholders of which are the Wu family. The other half is owned by Dairy Farm International which comes under Jardine Matheson, whose stocks are traded in Singapore and Bermuda
1710 2018-06-16 14:24:42 After having such a quiet week, with only one trade. It actually feels really good knowing that I waited patiently and used discipline when the setup actually appeared. Looking for the next week to come. #trader #stocks #stockmarket #discipline

1719 2018-06-16 14:20:12 The interesting bit about it is really, that Facebook is replacing the judiciary and is a modern form of the "stocks".
1720 2018-06-16 14:20:04 You must have noticed a big kesari tilak on some forehead, fucking bhakts, come what may they will hate a specific community,
1721 2018-06-16 14:19:52 I normally filter it through a cloth to get the bits out but I’m sure it’ll be right! It’s got plenty of sugar in it so it’ll be well preserved!
1722 2018-06-16 14:13:44 @BigCheds  You should chart some Canadian MJ stocks, I think it's about to boom again soon
1723 2018-06-16 14:11:38 Probably because @SenatorCollins likely owns private prison stocks in addition to weapons stocks
1724 2018-06-16 14:11:11 Aral na...ng stocks
1725 2018-06-16 14:09:41 I own lots of stocks. Bump stocks, fixed stocks, collapsible stocks, folding stocks. 'Murica!!!! /Deplorables
1726 2018-06-16 14:09:35 I have lower taxes, bonus from work . Consumer spending is up , stocks are ? And every speech is not about how terrible I am because I’m American. I’d say I’m winning!
1727 2018-06-16 14:09:26 A lot of gps ankle monitoring systems being worn. Who has stocks in the company that makes them? Sounds like an inside deal!

1743 2018-06-16 13:58:13 It isn’t the left that is radicalizing and arming angry white men; it’s not the left blocking background checks; it’s not us trying to get silencers, large capacity magazines, or police killing ammo; and certainly not us with ARs and bump stocks.
1744 2018-06-16 13:57:03 Stocks are low at the mo, but M&S, @fhwines , @OddbinsAbdnCity @OddbinsRoseMnt , @wss_elrick should all have stock in soon
1745 2018-06-16 13:55:57 Canadians. Do you have/use your tax free brokerage account ? I did but now it looks like downtown Stalingrad b/c you know.. gold mining stocks. So I just don't log in anymore.

1747 2018-06-16 13:55:37 It always seems like there is always delays in the stocks I invest in.
(Everyone probably thinks the same)
1748 2018-06-16 13:50:52 Canceled  and stocks sold.
1749 2018-06-16 13:50:20 I believe this is what The Orange Boy was referring to the whole time seeing as how he loves stocks and the market
1750 2018-06-16 13:50:00 Let ‘s not have faith in a democrat that acts like a republican. She took contributions from four republican PolyMet executives and co owns a hedgefund  that is full of big pharma and med tech stocks. All this is available in her reports.
1751 2018-06-16 13:47:45 Annoncer une "pénurie" permet de réduire les stocks.
Et faire ainsi de la place pour le carbu "bio"(surtout surpolluant!) à l'huile de palme.

1753 2018-06-16 13:46:18 If my investments in stocks gives me an overall return of 150% plus on yearly basis, I am ready to strict to investing long term & trading F&O just to keep my blood flowing
1754 2018-06-16 13:46:03 Try Uniqube in Taft. I think @prinsesaian still have stocks.
1755 2018-06-16 13:44:35 Feels like webvan in 99!!! We know how that movie ends. Buy value stocks, when they turn it will b wicked good fun
1756 2018-06-16 13:44:27 And philosophers are still attempting to debate the nature of reality with physicists. My short, but intimate, experience with the markets tells me that "the truth" is the last thing to affect overvalued stocks. Before that, please remember Vanderbilt's admonition to shorts.
1757 2018-06-16 13:41:12 Barron's Confidence Index
(High-grade index divided by intermediate-grade index; decline in latter vs. former generally indicates rising confidence, pointing to higher stocks.)
This week 81.0...Last week 80.6......Year ago 74.7
1758 2018-06-16 13:41:08 Abserloutely , not saying a nudge in terms of financial stocks and carrots is not also good idea. It clearly helps.
1759 2018-06-16 13:40:13 Lol see, I’m not that kinda person who stocks up on clothes for the heck of it like my friends  there has to be a purpose or my money can go elsewhere

Now excuse me while I go buy stocks in anti-histamine pharmaceutical companies so I can get some of my money back.
1761 2018-06-16 13:39:29 2 different things: index companies (Russell) only update/reconstitute list of holdings once/twice a year, the funds (Vanguard) buy those stocks until the list changes. Index funds track their index, but they are beholden to stale index lists

Literally 5 min into the 1st Ep of S2 and there are tears streaming down my face.
1769 2018-06-16 13:28:46 Exactly. Was typing something similar - hard to fault someone whose wealth (on paper) sky rockets simply because so many people feel his stocks are worth it.

1772 2018-06-16 13:27:23 Nope, most analysts agree stocks are over valuated based on this practice
1773 2018-06-16 13:26:42 What I don't see discussed very often is the number of variables used to screen for stocks. There's a delicate balance between focus (only screen on a few vars but strongly) and breadth (many vars but weak criteria).

1775 2018-06-16 13:25:02 i forgot to post this but @Elegant_Matt made me realize how much i want to kill myself after playing a set with him.

wtf are stocks against this guy
1776 2018-06-16 13:21:43 1/ It's hilarious how most people act only risk averse and start changing there whole setup when they loose some.
Escpecially when some in stocks means 10% and in crypto it's 50%+.
1777 2018-06-16 13:20:47 Don Quiti stocks loads too.

1782 2018-06-16 13:19:42 I was at a bank that wanted to get into stocks in 1981-2 thinking GS was going away. They bailed on the idea. GS was still in place.
1783 2018-06-16 13:17:45 Business advice is often total crap, but what I do know is that don't play the penny stocks..
1784 2018-06-16 13:16:34 What would you say the underlying difference is between two blue chip stocks who have identical beats and guidance increases, but the one pops and the other drops?..
1785 2018-06-16 13:15:49 Simply, is on my statement too, my main strategy is buying growing stocks that makes new high with great fundamentals.. in few world O'Neil CANSLIM way..

1788 2018-06-16 13:12:07 I love so far everything he is doing. Could care less who he banged in 06 has nothing to do with anything. Unemployment all time low stocks all time high and the wall is coming. We are doing great absolutely no complaints.
1789 2018-06-16 13:11:41 Left wing costal workers  high in their  office towers are confused by blue collar workers support of POTUS ,he talks the talk he walks the walk, fair trade with our neighbors ok companies like Maytag leaving to save a few penny’s on stocks no more
1790 2018-06-16 13:11:15 The technical equation would be:{future price + dividends received} > current price, to cover the edge case of stocks that move very little, but pay big dividends. More edge cases include: Retaining at certain % ownership in a company, lockup periods, and others.
1791 2018-06-16 13:11:05 Mr Setalvad has managed the HDFC Small Cap fund well in the past few years. Considering his track record, the fund is likely to do well in future also (this isn't a recommendation). But beware small cap stocks are the riskiest in the spectrum of large-, mid- & small-cap universe.
1792 2018-06-16 13:11:04 You think CNBC will write a mea culpa after this doozy cover headline:  “Stocks cut losses as Wall Street shrugs off trade-war fears”

1809 2018-06-16 12:58:55 Ah yes, so I guess similar "crowding" issues arise (as with tracker funds)  The money "auto chases" the factors (stocks) that did well the past. Its a positive feedback loop.Thank goodness we still have some old school active managers to put a dampener on this auto trading gig 
1810 2018-06-16 12:57:10 Galing akong National Book Store sa SM Southmall. Kinausap ako ng staff na  wala daw stocks ang book ko dahil sold out daw. Ubos lagi. Happy heart 
1811 2018-06-16 12:57:00 Not represented by you but you told the truth. Held up republican work until would deal with DACA. See how that worked out.They promised they would and now forgotten. Bump stocks ban promised, forgotten. Immigration reform, forgotten. Basic human rights,FORGOTTEN. 
KEEP STRONG!!!
1812 2018-06-16 12:52:55 The same with the overall stockmarkets a very big tradewar breaks out VIX is very low, Gold low, stocks go even higher So maybe investors think we all are winners in a war, or  are CB buying shares ?
1813 2018-06-16 12:51:31 I inherited money last year. It's all in stocks that were well managed. I've made a 1.5% return since Nov. I'm not complaining, but I'm not seeing a great economy. Oh, my take home pay has increased $150 a month this year, but considering the increase in prices, etc..a loss.
1814 2018-06-16 12:48:15 Poor Americans hate the elite. The ones that will suffer the most have No mutual funds stocks bonds or  Own homes.  Upper middle class and upper class will be fine.  Are really doing well.  Some Can live just off dividends.  Salary is gravy.
1815 2018-06-16 12:46:23 I’m a bit miffed bc my mom wouldn’t let us eat sugar cereals (i.e. fruity pebbles) as a kid, but she always stocks these cereals for my nephews and niece...but now I’m 23 & eating fruity pebbles for breakfast & it’s freaking fantastic let me tell you maybe it was worth the wait
1816 2018-06-16 12:45:26 #Gold tumbled with stocks on Friday but it is still undervalued. A crypto backed by gold is what the market needs.

1857 2018-06-16 11:58:34 Exactly. It’s a straight political sell if the case is done. Lets buildup stocks, parts and create infrastructure will make Industrail Base  jump in and also the general public will see it translated in work. This is the easiest of all political sales
1858 2018-06-16 11:57:55 Central bank figure will not show these and can't also. It will not show cash flows, contracts, backlogs and stocks. I can owe 2b$ to a bank and can have 3b$ in stock. Central bank will see this as unhedged 2b$ while in reality I am on positive side with 1b$.

1865 2018-06-16 11:49:45 Mark the amount is correct but "unhedged" is not correct. Receiveables, stocks, backlogs and contracts r not included in this number. A contractor doing business abroad can owe 2b$ to a Turkish bank while holding a contract from abroad government with same currency amount.

2087 2018-06-16 06:19:52 Ranks are based on the momentum for past 3/6/12 weeks. Lower the rank, higher the momentum.

2089 2018-06-16 06:18:04 Yep you just buy stocks and get obscenely wealthy what a terrible system
2090 2018-06-16 06:17:43 This is true in terms of a stocks; but when you can buy him at a significantly better price why would you pay the absurd mark-up he’s charging?
2091 2018-06-16 06:17:09 Rod & Rog have been wrong on these stocks for a long time. And continue to be so. Their value crunching bias and DCFs fail to open their eyes to what is really going on. It’s like “how is NEtflix worth more than Disney?”
2092 2018-06-16 06:16:56 Heeeelp!!who is near sm north or sm fairview?? Please help me find if there are stocks of colourette's colourtint jn shades zola or thalia? Im desperate
2093 2018-06-16 06:15:34 Oh, please. Google this Reuters report - "Emerging markets stocks, currencies hit by a week of worries". Bursa M'sia & the Ringgit aren't the only games in town!..@guanenglim @AzminAli

2098 2018-06-16 06:10:04 You hit the nail on the head. HOMES SHOULD BE FOR SHELTER. Therefore end the taxes on ownership and end corporations owning RESIDENTIAL #vanRE Stocks do not get taxed for ownership, only when you sell & realize gain. Property taxes are setting dangerous precedent as we seeing.
2099 2018-06-16 06:09:20 Thus, capital formation is measured from data relating to production, export and import of items going into this category of investment and from estimates of the changes in stocks of these goods.

2101 2018-06-16 06:08:03 Completely Agree Ashish. I know MM Forging doesn't have any pledged shares. Was just echoing yr views & just added the criteria I choose for picking such stocks in consumption sector
2102 2018-06-16 06:06:22 For the estimation of capital formation (and consumption) in the Indian economy the CSO employs the commodity flow method. Estimates of the value of construction, machinery and equipment and of changes in stocks for each of these two activities are made separately.
2103 2018-06-16 06:04:40 Your time tables are off. No direct use case benefit today, because its early, your investing in a future tech cycle that needs time to mature, which is why the risk / reward is so great. If you want to invest in something already making a massive impact today just look at stocks
2104 2018-06-16 06:04:17 Minimum age raised to 21 to legally purchase, proven domestic abusers required to turn in firearms instead of just forbidding them, ban bump stocks and silencers, require gun owners to have their weapons insured to reimburse victims of wrongful shooting...for starts :)

2110 2018-06-16 06:00:40 I get that it doesn’t appear to be value. I’d agree with that. But that’s not anyone’s overall call. Real estate, stocks, pieces of a poker player, it’s just a market. Don’t like the price? Don’t pay it. Just an auction. The market will figure it out. Always does.

2117 2018-06-16 05:50:13 @elonmusk I think the only way to stop MSM bias is to develop an AI that that finds stories depending on its purpose ie stocks, disasters, crime. These AI’s will then just report what they find without bias because it wouldn’t be programmed.  Willing to bet this is the future.
2118 2018-06-16 05:50:09 Great weekend produce deals on selected lines in stores while stocks last - until the end of plays this Sunday.
2119 2018-06-16 05:49:06 i.e., construction, machinery and equipment, and change in stocks. Among these different methods may be mentioned the commodity flow method, the expenditure method and the inventory method.
2120 2018-06-16 05:48:30 Of course people can be mad when they blow a late lead. But there still needs to be some level of perspective. There is none. Every time someone screws up, the solution is to send them to the stocks. It's just maddening
2121 2018-06-16 05:48:04 The whole reason securities are regulated differently is because they rely on a promise of value attachment. You can't do anything with stocks except hold them, trade them, and sell them.

2127 2018-06-16 05:40:04 Amit ji, it will happen only if nifty close below 10650...then chances of  drastic fall ...if hold then these stocks should  outperform for shorter term ( with one month horizon) astrologically

2131 2018-06-16 05:36:12 Unless you’re living under a rock, you would have known better that most blockchain/crypto stocks are down 75%+ from December. $BLOK $BKPPK is building real shareholder value & sitting below NAV. Feel free to bash, won’t change how I approach my investments
2132 2018-06-16 05:34:46 Thus, net capital formation is the addition to fixed capital, i.e., (i) buildings (residential and non-residential), (ii) construction and other works, and (iii) machinery and equipment, and (iv) producers' stocks of working capital.
2133 2018-06-16 05:30:31 I am positive on real estate stocks overall. They are quite undervalued relative to inherent value. No doubt that on the ground real estate is moving slow but by the time u c traction there, stocks wud have already shot up a lot. As mkts price everything in advance
2134 2018-06-16 05:29:19 Glad I'm married, old, and have a beagle pic in my profile!
2135 2018-06-16 05:27:45 With so much of liquidity with the fund houses, don’t you think they would compromise on the quality of stocks they hold in small cap and mid cap funds?

2144 2018-06-16 05:19:26 Buy stocks with a 10 year perspective. Big money is usually made only over long term. If fundamentals change, you can always sell.

2172 2018-06-16 04:37:49 The best way to test a new trading strategy is to pick a few stocks according to its criteria, take a snapshot of the stock chart, and come back a few weeks/months later. Did it work out according to plan (at least partially), or is the strategy complete crap?

2192 2018-06-16 04:07:04 There is a very strong correlation over the last 10 yrs between the price of gold and the stock market. So a decline in gold is not good news for stocks. The decline of liquidity?

2202 2018-06-16 03:51:42 Overheard people at the pool today talking about US stocks so I joined in and told them that the economy is about to crash and that it’s a good time to begin looking for shorts and they all went silent and then started talking when I walked away. I’m so far ahead it’s unreal.
2203 2018-06-16 03:48:46 Even just daily stocks can go up or down by a percent or two. It is the long-term changes that are more worrisome, like Nintendo over the last month.

2206 2018-06-16 03:47:23 Very good advice here. I can read charts decently but I tried playing options on stocks I don't know well and got burned. I learn more each day following this brainiac.
2207 2018-06-16 03:46:40 The flurry of new issues (stocks and etfs) continue to come out, and the supply is getting soaked up.  When the merry-go-round slows/stops it will be interesting to see if the move down is a ferocious one.  ETFs in particular are all jumping over themselves, holding same stocks!
2208 2018-06-16 03:44:52 Shuffling of stocks is a Zero Sum Game.
2209 2018-06-16 03:42:43 Many people hold stocks for year or 2 and sell as soon it starts  rally and enter into other stock which will require them to hold that stock for another year. Don't do that mistake.

2217 2018-06-16 03:35:01 I would modify to note that participation by small-caps doesn't = breadth these days, because there are now small-cap ETFs that can be easily ramped (unlike pre-2001). Better indicator is when rally narrows to momentum stocks, whether large or small, (see 2015 top--R2K led).

2223 2018-06-16 03:26:12 One challenge is you need to find out what the numbers were before the move, not after. And then, are those numbers different than the average stock or the top losing stocks?

2235 2018-06-16 03:15:39 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your cancer

2237 2018-06-16 03:13:02 Take away their ability to buy or sell stocks or to own more than 2 pieces of real estate.  They get rich on shady deals.
2238 2018-06-16 03:12:31 Have you tried learning meditation techniques? Learning to clear my mind of negative subconscious noise in between stocks has helped me make comebacks in the past.
2239 2018-06-16 03:12:11 How do you manage your charts while trading? I mean how do you keep track of all the stocks and know a specific stock is hiking while trading? Do you set alerts or something?  Thanks for all your teaching

2249 2018-06-16 03:05:30 I was listening to Jim Cramer on Mad Money today in the lightening round session and he was asked about IQ stock. He really didn't say if it was a buy but he stated that Ali Baba and Baidu are the Chinese stocks to own. My guess is that he just doesn't have enough information.

2265 2018-06-16 02:51:36 Sorry to interrupt, but stocks are general treated to be in an uptrend ( to be more expensive), there will always be improvement and innovation, therefore stock will be going up in price. That’s my opinion.
2266 2018-06-16 02:50:58 You are a pathological liar.  Give us a list of the companies so we can research them.  Any that came back is because they got away with paying taxes due and now they have your huge tax cut.  Most companies have downsized, used their largess from you to buy back their stocks...

2307 2018-06-16 02:34:43 Do you ever consider calls on stronger and puts on weaker stocks in the same sector as a way to hedge against unexpected sector risk?

2314 2018-06-16 02:31:15 there's no such thing as identifying moving stocks at market open. u gotta do tons homework. first thing is to review charts every night on ALL time frames so you know important resistance and support levels. also need to know chart pattern - that can help u make quick decisions

2323 2018-06-16 02:20:31 B.C. with their shitshow joke of a coalition government, Alberta with their accidental N.D.P. government and Canada as a whole with Junior, Moroneau and McKenna are the laughing stocks. Certainly not Premier Scott Moe.

2326 2018-06-16 02:17:12 Good point John. No bump stocks of 90 bullet clips on muskets. Fuck these Nazi, KKK inbred hillbillies.
2327 2018-06-16 02:14:44 these guys calls themselves big, its just they have margins to sell option. Real big guys are those who write options and bring the index to their side by manipulating stocks.
2328 2018-06-16 02:13:18 Many in congress have stocks in the for PROFIT PRISON INDUSTRY. Count on Trump being in it!

2330 2018-06-16 02:10:44 I recommend saving up for necessities like your own property, investments or stocks, and getting rid of student-debt. Well that’s your choice. Nothing I can do but to support it 
2331 2018-06-16 02:08:24 I’ve been following a bit the whole fish farming thing, as friends are working on a new vaccine delivery method for fish stocks.  Fascinating area and ready for larger research investment into best practices and sustainability.  Interesting about Tuna

2335 2018-06-16 02:04:25 Right I know they can't breed them in captivity, but releasing larger fish to add to natural stocks would do a lot to help I would think.

Also lol 
2336 2018-06-16 02:03:39 That's numbers that are verified.

Facts.

We're increasing the deficit at rates approaching the 2008 depression and companies are buying back stocks far more than investing.

2340 2018-06-16 02:01:54 Confirmation bias is the worst thing in spec stocks. It's best to trade with zero emotion although it's hard to do when you have your own money involved. Unfortunately (or fortunately) every year there are fresh faces that believe the hype.

2346 2018-06-16 01:55:59 When tax cuts increase the deficit & decrease general budget revenue for the express purpose of giving money to the rich, big business , & foreign investors, it’s a money scam.  Corporations buying back their stocks.  Living expenses increase; wages don’t increase. It’s a scam.
2347 2018-06-16 01:54:55 Dang! @LindseyGrahamSC I actually liked what you said for once!!

2353 2018-06-16 01:51:11 During the stocks markets upsurge in Obama’s first 6 or so years, the top 1% made about 92% of the money. Berkley California college did the study. So who’s helping the wealthy?  That was the biggest gain since Clinton’s years when it was about 70% I believe.

2360 2018-06-16 01:47:10 #Tips for when we put stocks on watch
1) Look to see if the chart holds
2) How it reacts with volume
3) Is it converting
If variables doesnt change we alert
We dont alert if they move suddenly from the feed, Because then we would be alerting it at a higher price to our followers

2363 2018-06-16 01:46:09 You're projecting again. Clinton and Obama are small fishes. Trump taking down your NWO masters. Look up what happened to prince alwaleed of saud after Trump took office. Alwaleed put Obama in the WH. Lot more to come. Buy popcorn stocks.

2366 2018-06-16 01:45:14 As of late I’m the stock market. The 3.3 billion that he “made” this week with his 16% stake of amazon’s stock can easily dwindle to 1.5 million within a few weeks. Stocks are not liquid assets and shouldn’t indicate how employees get paid.

2371 2018-06-16 01:39:32 We could also make sure their businesses and investments fail.  They only care about money.  Any donor supporting this evil needs to feel the burn too.  How do we tank Mercer and Adelson's stocks?  How do we bring Hannity down?

2374 2018-06-16 01:38:34 As of now, I believe the ATF is trying to amend the definition of "machinegun" to include bump stocks. The definition they are trying to implement is problematic as it tries to argue that bump stocks use one pull of the trigger with no more user manipulation, which is false.

2376 2018-06-16 01:32:41 Listening to the kids talk about stocks and im impressed. My daughter saying noooo you have to follow the chart 
2377 2018-06-16 01:32:21 For the language of the law, it basically means that if it can shoot more than one bullet per one trigger pull, it is a "machinegun" as defined. Semi-autos require the trigger to be reset and pulled again for each bullet. Bump stocks do not change this mechanism.

2384 2018-06-16 01:25:59 Think like buying a car. Would you buy any old car off the cuff? HELL NO. Same with Stocks & Shares.
2385 2018-06-16 01:22:55 So just let people have bump stocks because they'll find a way to do it anyway? Should we use that reasoning with everything? Make drunk driving legal, they'll do it anyway.

2402 2018-06-16 01:05:03 That was my thought too. Obviously these guys get paid way more in stocks and options than salary. Still crazy that say, IBM CEO getting paid that much money while the company constantly downsizes in the name of resource action. #unfair

2410 2018-06-16 00:52:18 1) People keep pushing adults into low skill low paying jobs with minimum wage increases

2417 2018-06-16 00:39:06 Curious why are the markets not responding. Stocks keep going up. Should we brace for a big crash if a trade war starts? Or are the markets ignoring all the noise and waiting to see the outcome.
2418 2018-06-16 00:39:05 @privenyofficial can you please keep your promise to have unlimited stocks? some of us wanted to buy it but will need more time to save up.

2421 2018-06-16 00:35:55 The constant tirade against salmon farming is getting sooooo old. Science has proven salmon farming has no effect on wild stocks. Over fishing in the past and continued fishing of endangered stocks is the problem.
2422 2018-06-16 00:35:42 You know that sad part about this is that the president was probably going to yay you did another good thing for me now the people of America will be having to pay more money for a clean water which gives us more money in my stocks and bonds this is totally illegal
2423 2018-06-16 00:34:14 Uhm. I call it the greatest opportunity to invest. When the 2008 crash took stocks down to 7000, investments have quadrupled in 10 years.

2427 2018-06-16 00:31:51 Not sure how those fish stocks could be overextended if they are fished at sustainable rates. The story mentions that they could, but doesn't explain how that possibly could happen.
2428 2018-06-16 00:31:12 Why ban bump stocks?
2429 2018-06-16 00:30:02 It may be wise and prudent to slowly liquidate all equity positions and be in cash because the international trade scene may get very ugly.
Both bond market and particularly banks stocks ( already in a bear cycle mode ) are signalling a serious negative outlook on the horizon

2431 2018-06-16 00:29:14 stay away from battleground stocks with a lot of competition is another rule you might want to consider.

2433 2018-06-16 00:25:11 $SPX $SPY if trade tariffs are good for stocks then stocks should go up next week.
2434 2018-06-16 00:23:59 Interesting. Another idea is to regenerate your "information horizon" chart for different sub-periods. If passive truly absorbs selling pressure, then strong momentum stocks should have exhibited slower mean reversion in recent years.

2442 2018-06-16 00:17:13 But Crowley's assertion was trying to implicate her for 'states rights' on gun control.

Her national policy view is well documented, and she reaffirmed them within the debate. Assault ban, bump stocks, etc.

2444 2018-06-16 00:16:59 I would like to assume that they replenish stocks whenever the KR headquarters send stuff to them.
2445 2018-06-16 00:16:33 I think it’s a standard package in Nature Republic cause I always see the 10+10 masks wherever I go BUT I think it’s until stocks run out cause the one in Mega didn’t have certain sets (I wanted the honey one) when I went last month.
2446 2018-06-16 00:15:24 That's what I like about you having a Target price on these stocks. I been long on FDX and day trading it when it dips knowing that the target is 270. Bought some 265 Calls when it dipped to 260 today. Probably get some 270 Calls to day trade Next Week.

2497 2018-06-15 23:41:42 @Rob5555 Lots of wishing and hoping with the drug stocks. May or may not happen. Meanwhile, CELG down 27% YTD.

2501 2018-06-15 23:38:48 Ya know i actually still don’t understand/never knew why Smash 4 was 2 stocks and Brawl was 3

Isn’t Smash 4 supposedly faster? What made it come to the conclusion that Smash 4 should be 2 stock

2505 2018-06-15 23:35:19 I’ve heard everyone who has played it say it should be 3 stocks possibly more as the meta improves
2506 2018-06-15 23:34:42 For a swing trader who’s time frame is less than 1 quarter, eps and sales data is only good to narrow down the universe of stocks

2513 2018-06-15 23:27:07 but Smash 4 was faster than Brawl, which is 3 stocks.
2514 2018-06-15 23:26:09 It'd be interesting to think about the faculty draft stocks of various undergrad 4-year cohorts. Who'd be at the top?
2515 2018-06-15 23:26:05 its faster than smash 4 so 3 stocks or 4 stocks might be best

2520 2018-06-15 23:24:30 Steven what do you think about $IQ?
2521 2018-06-15 23:23:52 Ban detachable stocks and magazine sales over 30 rounds but, to let people have deadlier weapons and just go, and tell people their left to die if govt fails which is inevitable is....yes not good its. Pistols you can save lives, rifles will likely cost many, many more. It’s math
2522 2018-06-15 23:23:28 Yeah I've been trying to get out (but for a good price) and did last night cuz of the site. Like twist a lot tbh. But didn't want to be stuck with no exchange if stocks scammed.
2523 2018-06-15 23:22:25 What will these actions do to the value of the dollar? Stocks?
2524 2018-06-15 23:22:24 I’m not ready to necessarily throw Chris Hardwick in the stocks, but man, after reading that blog post it sure makes these ID10T interviews (in this case Rachel Bloom) sound pretty sociopathic.
2525 2018-06-15 23:21:11 You have no clue what you speak of.  Do some research before you comment.  Our Gov has done virtually zero to protect salmon.  Stocks have been diminishing since the 70’s. It’s critical now.  Scream at the politicians more. Not less.  We need action. More hatcheries no farming!!
2526 2018-06-15 23:20:28 It’s incredible. I’m appalled by the number of my friends that support this. But I know it’s only because of the money they are making on stocks

2534 2018-06-15 23:12:15 by laws as it’s a, “who cares about 9,500 deaths if it’s small and less intimidating”, and this more likely to be used and not deterrance effective, and easy to carry (ban detachable stocks yes, that’s great), but unless a leader in good faith is in office to....do that is basic
2535 2018-06-15 23:12:13 the stocks are from my pack that’s why
2536 2018-06-15 23:10:54 Live from The Reservation, Coldwater ACME baseball takes on the St Henry Redskins. Since this is a make-up game, Coldwater is the home team in the first game of tonight’s double-header. Cavs Weigel on the hill. Cavs wearing new orange shirts & stirrup stocks.

2539 2018-06-15 23:08:42 Every time Donald mentions the word trade, the media and establishment scream that the world will end. They have said this so many times now, that stocks are beginning to yawn it off.
2540 2018-06-15 23:08:22 Tether all over again. This is old #fud. Not to undercut its legitimacy, it’s just if ppl cared about it at all, $btc should be dead after last tether auditing going no where news. On the other hand, isn’t fed doing the same thing with dollar? Yet stocks only make new highs.

2561 2018-06-15 22:49:38 Yeah man that shit is wild they have the top banks, stocks, finance, trade, etc. Stocks are tricky because you really have to be willing to invest big and lose big. lol

2563 2018-06-15 22:48:39 Funny how COFCO (in a way the Chinese) can dictate bean spreads though presence at most important delivery location. Record bean stocks in Chicago, more beans registered then held, premiums 30+ from delivery - all spreads going nowhere.
2564 2018-06-15 22:48:38 Instead of locking up  Manafort and the others in jail, they could put them in stocks and pillories in front of the White House and Trump Tower as they did in the Colonial Era.

2565 2018-06-15 22:47:36 Depends on how their legal insider trading stocks are doing. This is a rule we must change.
2566 2018-06-15 22:47:33 Bump stocks are made to circumvent the law. The only purpose they have is to create a machine gun
2567 2018-06-15 22:46:19 Put this into prospective.  300 shares amzn will =500k . Let’s say amzn runs up 1000 pts in a year you make 300k . Same 500k you can buy home , tear it down & put up new construction in tri state that you can flip 1.3-1.5 mil . Stocks vs real estate debate
2568 2018-06-15 22:46:14 Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you’re looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you’re still an idiot.

2570 2018-06-15 22:43:58 Gold & Gold Stocks Fail at the 200-dma this week. Could be vulnerable until end of Fed rate hikes.
2571 2018-06-15 22:42:18 Weapons are defined by the action of the gun (auto, semi-auto, etc.). No such category as "assault-style" weapons. There are ZERO AR-15's in the US military inventory. Bump stocks should be illegal, the entire concept is ridiculous and changes the overall integrity of rifle.
2572 2018-06-15 22:41:49 If registration fees are keeping you away...no longer required. 

Late nights keeping you away? The last4 races we were done by 10:30 ish

Rough track? No longer

Factory and street stocks are now draw/redraw
2573 2018-06-15 22:41:22 "We save stock options for people we want to retain."  This was said to me during a discussion about a promotion I earned when I asked if the level was eligible for stocks.
2574 2018-06-15 22:41:17 I’m using money I made from my stocks to pay off my debt, i feel like I’m 35

2583 2018-06-15 22:27:47 The DOW priced in Euro, GBP, CAD, AUD & CEW (basket of EM currencies) closed at all-time weekly highs. Now just waiting on the JPY, CHF, and the long bond. Bull market in stocks & the Dollar still intact
2584 2018-06-15 22:27:43 I LEGIT called Jake's inheritance being Blockbuster stocks 2 seconds before it happened 

Bow before me
2585 2018-06-15 22:25:52 I can see this.. boston still have a lot of future draft stocks..
2586 2018-06-15 22:25:33 Can we get it sub sat anywhere? I see it on stocks for 1 sat
2587 2018-06-15 22:21:59 Or own stocks.  Which is how they really make the big bucks.  Their ‘pension’ is the same as every other federal employee, and they do not get a salary for life, as so many people mistakenly believe.
2588 2018-06-15 22:20:45 Be Best, Trumpkin!
2589 2018-06-15 22:18:55 So I wrote some new code on TradingView last night, so tonight I’ve got to redo all my watchlist’s for stocks to plug in and backtest...
2590 2018-06-15 22:16:39 Yikes.  Ain't good for that Fox sale, since that is one of Disney's strongest properties.  Disney wanted to give Fox stocks, while Comcast is offering cash.
2591 2018-06-15 22:15:51 No!
2592 2018-06-15 22:14:48 When will THAT investigation begin?
2593 2018-06-15 22:14:18 Come and see this Ozzie lass play at our festival in Scotland. Too my hat to her parents who upped stocks and helped them chase their dreams. @duncarronfort #clanranaldtrust #SpiritOfDuncarron
2594 2018-06-15 22:13:32 there is a huge movement to end mass incarceration -- lots of people are working on it. Unfortunately the TrumPence administration likes it & Sessions (among others) has investments in private prison stocks, so they have an interest in making people into prisoners.
2595 2018-06-15 22:12:43 I’m confused here. You want to convict and vilify ALL men because some are pigs? Ummm yeah private companies can until they lose their stocks and boycotts occur. Which is what happens
2596 2018-06-15 22:11:46 Weekly recap. $FIT bouncer early the week. And $TSLA recovered dramatically over the week - still ten percent off highs from last year. Hoping for no drama until earnings season and for the 4th, but read 50cent was back back in the vix this week... #markets #trading #stocks
2597 2018-06-15 22:10:25 Investigate and you link stocks from North Africa, Middle East , Iran or Pakistan are behind the Paris sheep herd. One the thing is common to all both in Nigeria and France. Afterall their largest population in Europe is there.
2598 2018-06-15 22:10:21 We've heard from a lot of your guys that our top #stock pages are out of date! So we added live feeds. Not sure how we didn't think of this before! #stocks #investing #topstocks
2599 2018-06-15 22:10:20 Review these #stocks that made record highs: $MPWR, $VEEV, $JKHY, $WIX, $FFIV, $EA, $JCOM, $DBX, $ANSS, $INTU
2600 2018-06-15 22:10:15 Yeah, it was strange to see Carter Worth recently acknowledge the bullish breakout from the wedge, and yet he was bearish, based on cherry picking certain stocks that did break mid/long term trends. Kinda odd.
2601 2018-06-15 22:09:28 Tool.
2602 2018-06-15 22:09:24 Stocks dropped a little today as some decided to take their profits after another outstanding week!

2604 2018-06-15 22:07:52 Okay but maybe now is time to buy some cheap theranos stocks! I want to become a stocks trader
2605 2018-06-15 22:06:48 Weekly recap. Large moves within solar this week in both directions depending on the stock ( $RUN, $SEDG). Enterprise software came out of nowhere and plowed higher ( $DBX, $SMAR, $DOCU). Most tech stocks I hold recovered dramatically from last Thursday’s rotation ($NFLX) #stocks
2606 2018-06-15 22:06:38 Last few weeks Aussie gold stocks have been strong across the board.. interesting sell off last night.. i still remain bullish on #gold until the weekly chart tells me otherwise.... i dont think it will spook the Aussie gold stocks.. i think theres underlying strength..
2607 2018-06-15 22:05:46 I kept adding Pharma stocks, one on the recommendation of @deepakmohoni  He never recommends IT though. Being an ex Infy had added those at 950 range as well.
2608 2018-06-15 22:04:38 Really just looking for clear liquid solutions that  would taste like something else. She can't have solid food so for months she's been limited to jello and stocks
2609 2018-06-15 22:03:47 Hahah don’t trip ya gotta start somewhere bro! I have some AI, tech and Asian corporations. China has some of the most aggressive stocks.

2611 2018-06-15 22:01:38 Which is why Im not doing forex and stocks. Tbh, crypto atm is really just useful in the trading side of it.. the technology will probably start having real time impact in 3-5 years... For now, Im riding this money boat
2612 2018-06-15 22:00:00 The EDGE provides aggregated "internals" on 5 min timeframe. It's like having a 500-screen setup to track all stocks in $SPX simultaneously.
2613 2018-06-15 21:59:42 I would say 3 or 4 stocks. I don't like having to watch 2 stocks being played.
2614 2018-06-15 21:58:22 “Why didn’t you, Trump, ban bump-stocks and raise the age to purchase firearm to 21 when you said you would? Are you afraid of the @NRA?”
2615 2018-06-15 21:58:15 "While stocks last" is really a lie. I bought ToQger volume 1 more than 2 years after release and it still had everything it was supposed to. Those disclaimers should just be ignored.
2616 2018-06-15 21:56:59 Buying stocks that have recently been tanking is not value investing. Buying cheap stocks that have a good chance of being genuinely undervalued is.
2617 2018-06-15 21:56:37 Trump- I just love that man!
2618 2018-06-15 21:56:31 Fish farms employee thousands of people directly and tens of thousands indirectly bringing millions of dollars to local economies. Not to mention the stress relief off wild salmon stocks which are overfished heavily.
2619 2018-06-15 21:56:21  we did it without nike stocks
2620 2018-06-15 21:55:45 We Trump supporters don’t care. We care about the great job he’s doing and fixing 44’s mistakes. Unemployment, Consumer Confidence, Stocks (401k) are all doing great!!! #MAGA2020 keep thinking we care about the triggered people like you.
2621 2018-06-15 21:55:40 Advance decline line is at a new high and there is tremendous strength in certain stocks and sectors
2622 2018-06-15 21:55:30 Why is it that the only people who rip Adam are those who own under-performing stocks and/or stocks of crappy companies?  (Full disclosure:  I own both $SGMO and $BLUE ) .... But gimme a break....a bit ridiculous to point a finger at Adam for SGMO’s relatively poor market cap.
2623 2018-06-15 21:54:39  stocks too
2624 2018-06-15 21:53:46 Build the wall-problem solved laws have been in place for years remember BHO put them in cages, trump uses a converted Walmart with school and health and human services- so cry me a river

2627 2018-06-15 21:52:39 You sir, are a piece of work! You made your millions off drugs, sold stocks & now attack #Veterans that NEED med. U have my 70 yr old father along with millions more #Suffering due to UR wishy washy frame of mind! We have vets DYING! Comment?
2628 2018-06-15 21:52:12 I'd like to postulate that simply the network that your crypto builds is what builds its value 100%. I put for the $V and $MC stocks charts as an example.
2629 2018-06-15 21:50:19 Gas is different because it is traded on the stock market. When stocks are high it is in demand.  Stocks low and demand is low then we get better gas prices.
2630 2018-06-15 21:49:27 I wonder if there are stocks to invest in.
2631 2018-06-15 21:47:42 Beginning to think as UK is going backwards in so many areas, the idea of public stocks & humiliation for the nasty criminals who prey on frail elderly would be best justice & save UK taxpayers millions in prison costs.
2632 2018-06-15 21:46:21 not as strong a feeling on gold yet, but gold/stocks have been tracking in tandem mostly. did both bottom today? gold hit my level in the 79 area and so far it is holding. massive potential to see 1400 from here. next week is key.
2633 2018-06-15 21:45:58 I don’t know what IRS pronouncement you keep getting the baseball card analogy from, but the only one I’ve seen is Crypto held as a capital asset = stocks, bonds & investment property. Some Crypto may in fact be considered a security subject to wash sale. IRS needs to clarify.

2639 2018-06-15 21:40:33 Isn't Bezos worth based on a price to earnings ratio of over 500 where Berkshire is about 10? I think you could make the case that he couldn't employ his assets inefficiently if he wanted to. Amazon and many other tech stocks have a lot of potential downside.

2714 2018-06-15 20:50:21 Speculators have rationale for buying stocks that THINK they are going higher and that is usually higher future earnings. "can sell shares higher later" is vacuous statement and also peculiar. What does "can sell" mean. This is ranting only. One reason I have blocked that one.

2717 2018-06-15 20:49:03 I'm being asked why the stock market isn't reacting to the negative trade news. Question is why it hasn't made new highs with all the fiscal juice. Nearly 70% of S&P 500 stocks are trading below the January 26th peak!
2718 2018-06-15 20:46:33 There is no such thing as "Choppy Markets" or "Choppy price action", however there is such a thing as poor selection of stocks to trade.

2720 2018-06-15 20:45:18 Ha! Sure, but thinking about it, pension plans are pre-tax (never get to people's bank accounts to be saved) and then there's credit creation and asset re-allocation from stocks possibly. Many other choices too. 

Still funny happening while the savings rate is negative.

2735 2018-06-15 20:34:29 Presidents have far less control over markets than most people would have you believe. There are no magical levers they can pull to force stocks to rise or fall.

2748 2018-06-15 20:27:13 Uhhh point 7 covers gain/loss treatment of Crypto: capital assets vs inventory. For capital assets, Crypto has capital gain/loss similar to stocks & investment property. No mention of baseball cards. So we still need clarity from IRS if they agree w SEC on securities & wash sales

2760 2018-06-15 20:22:47 URGENT: food banks across UK are low in stocks of food. Next month children will be off school for summer holidays. Without school meals families struggle to feed children & turn to food banks for help.
URGENT: Please give what you can to avoid children going hungry this summer.

2766 2018-06-15 20:19:15 One thing I'm learning about investing, even after doing this for 30 yrs, is that investing in individual stocks is VERY risky.

2768 2018-06-15 20:18:47 Oh, CR, what right of yours am i infringing on? Do you love bump stocks that much? Do you own one? Com’on own up.
2769 2018-06-15 20:18:46 Yeah there's a big spread at the moment. If you market bought on stocks. exchange you'd be paying 10 sats, but if you got sold into on tradeogre you'd get it for 6 sats. It's taken me a few days to build a position

2772 2018-06-15 20:14:34 Yeah it's moved faster than I expected, was still trying to accumulate. With these microcaps the spread is normally quite big so use caution. It's up 50% because the majority of the volume is on stocks. exchange where it's 10 sats, but it's currently 8 sats on tradeogre
2773 2018-06-15 20:13:16 If you're into stocks, twitter's price has grown 40% in the past month and if you're going to tweet you might as well get paid for it.
2774 2018-06-15 20:13:14 I've been working towards learning short selling, and currently use a broker that basically fills if they can. Do you have any advice on routing your trades and finding stocks to short? I notice some people use different brokers for different approaches.
2775 2018-06-15 20:11:49 AT THE CLOSE: Stocks recorded modest losses Friday as the U.S. and China exchanged blows in an ongoing dispute over trade....
2776 2018-06-15 20:11:35 Stocks sink early on renewed US-China trade spat, then rebound to close with modest losses. Dow ends -84, -0.3% to 25,090. Nasdaq -0.2%, S&P -0.1%.

Winners and losers nearly even on Nasdaq, while losers have small edge on NYSE.

For the week Nasdaq +1.3%, S&P +0.01%, Dow -0.9%
2777 2018-06-15 20:11:24 Good luck replacing a spoke. It’s nearly impossible to replace their steel spokes. I’m so over Mavic. Meaning no one stocks them and incredibly difficult to deal with Mavic directly.
2778 2018-06-15 20:11:08 From my perspective.. #uranium stocks track Spot price of #U3O8. Every deal Kazatomprom signs, no matter the price, reduces available Spot market supply. Cameco needs to buy up to 10M lbs soon, these deals increase odds that U3O8 prices will rise when $CCO buys!

2794 2018-06-15 20:04:42 I'm on a per share basis. But minimum commission is $1 per trade. Until I get over 200 shares position size, I will pay $1/trade fixed fee. Still much cheaper than the broker I started with. Regarding rebates, this may work when I trade the stocks directly instead of CFDs. ;-)

2797 2018-06-15 20:04:31 well, not a lot to say i havent already said, but in sum:

2814 2018-06-15 19:55:46 Oh for crying out loud...don't play that rationale Elon.  Reagan pulled that shit, shifting CEO's from salary to stocks and it's fueled NONSENSE like stock buybacks among other things  It has made things worse with companies chasing short term gains even more.

2872 2018-06-15 19:09:17 Being the underdog on game five with a lead of three stocks to one on my counterpick and then watching the better player turn it up and figure out what needed to be done to win the set. 

Honestly even more fun than watching it happen to someone else.

2902 2018-06-15 18:54:35 Thinking about it... stock specific $$ vs time returns seems to be a function of how stocks perform once it’s larger cap (more than behavior). Basically a Netflix now has a much larger market cap (higher $$ weight) so will in all likelihood underperform how well it did when small

2909 2018-06-15 18:49:58 Stocks/securities are also considered property by the IRS and have to comply with wash sale rules. The IRS has not issued guidance on whether or not they consider Crypto a security so I recommend we hold off on declaring tax treatment until they release an updated statement.

2917 2018-06-15 18:44:45 Why compensate farmers if we end supply management? It's on buyers to price in the probability of the system ending when they buy quotas and farms. Being a dairy farmer isn't riskless. Just like buying a taxi medallion or stocks. Not govt's job to subsidize risk.

2996 2018-06-15 18:04:56 Given proper setups, tech based consumer cyclicals and logistical transportation stocks are my preference within my focus, ie. Amazon, Netflix, TWTR, etc. is where it's at right now.  Things change so stay tuned.
2997 2018-06-15 18:04:28 I meant it as scary sarcasm. Frightening or sad to see such adverts on a financial channel like Bloomberg. I don't recommend stocks, positions in commodities or trade myself. I was just stunned to see such an advertisement.
2998 2018-06-15 18:04:13 I hope you have already got your eidi from stocks 
2999 2018-06-15 18:04:03 Imagine if we understood stocks as well as we understood NBA trade language lmao. Boooooyyyyyyyy. But back to these trade scenarios.
3000 2018-06-15 18:03:52 Weed stocks and crypto going down, Amazon going up...I like it
3001 2018-06-15 18:03:51 Yes, knee jerk. But OMCs will not reduce ATF prices soon. So, party will be short for Aviation stocks. Sell Aviation stocks on every rise.
3002 2018-06-15 18:03:35 Mortgage Bonds hit session highs as Stocks add to losses. Dow -240 points on tariff woes and profit taking.
3003 2018-06-15 18:03:21 They Never promised to pass along ALL tax savings.  Besides everyone of those stocks participates in annual stock buy backs, they did before the tax scam and will after the tax scam.  So - Yes background noise.
3004 2018-06-15 18:03:16 As expected, Stocks open lower as the China trade tariff woes reemerge.
3005 2018-06-15 18:03:13 No trades today, I had to take care of some non trading business ...

3006 2018-06-15 18:02:55 What practical sell rules/advice do you recommend for longer term (months-years) positions? In other words, how do balance taking profits vs letting a trend ride with strong stocks? Simple moving average break, price level break, ATR stop, Fibonacci break, etc?
3007 2018-06-15 18:02:47 One of my favorite stocks. They have introduced Pro Rez Raw which has reinvented the way HD video footage is read and compressed. It’s a game changer IMO. Still in early stages of development as well.

3033 2018-06-15 17:45:59 I've been looking at cannabis stocks as in their own world but if mkt gets rocked I guess all stocks go with it.  Added $gwph on today's big weakness
3034 2018-06-15 17:45:39 I could be wrong but I think a few papers have showed that when MC weighted benchmarks announce changes, the new stocks outperform the deleted stocks in the short term (Momentum), but underperform in the long term (LT Reversal). This is at least my understanding.
3035 2018-06-15 17:44:36 Real men do 99 stocks
3036 2018-06-15 17:43:11 This assumes that the momentum effect holds positive for long periods. That's the issue. If you make a rebalance decision on momentum, but then never rebalance again, the momo effect for those stocks will disappear & more than likely turn into LT Reversal (mean reversion) stocks.

3088 2018-06-15 17:17:15 Correct, but because that index is MC weighted, those stocks that get deleted have such a small effect on the impact of its overall style, it makes no impact. Say you deleted a stock with large negative momentum, but that stock had a 0.02% weight. It is insignificant.

3103 2018-06-15 17:06:33 What stocks we playin with is the real question?
3104 2018-06-15 17:06:26 0/ Assets are often correlated in the short-term for market-structural reasons, as opposed to reasons related to fundamentals.

For instance, a major structural reason why stocks in the S&P500 are highly correlated with each other in the short term is the S&P500 future.
3105 2018-06-15 17:06:02 Thanks for the info. About me: I'm not short in any stock, long in 10-15 stocks average. I do use long term puts for hedging, using profits. Preferred names have been oil and coal stocks and indexes as of lately. Not saying its time, but time will come for oil. I'll be there then

3108 2018-06-15 17:04:14 Your account size/equity curve likely ebbs and flows, similar to stocks

When you increase trade size after a win streak or reduce due to drawdown, you're essentially buying high and selling low, which hurts long term performance

If you have faith in your system, do the opposite

3121 2018-06-15 17:00:05 Is there a place where one can look up which mutual funds own these stocks? As much as I like good investments, I'd like to make sure I don't own those.
3122 2018-06-15 17:00:03 The market does not know if you are long or short and could not care less. #forex #stocks
3123 2018-06-15 16:59:57 I hope the Democrats do bring back  Obama to  campaign. What a contrast! He gave us high tax, low employment, stocks down, high cost healthcare and gave Iran 150 billion to name a few. Is that really what us deplorable, uneducated, pieces of sh** Trump voters are going to elect?
3124 2018-06-15 16:59:51 I think that if people (you) don't come up with better solutions, the bull in the china shop will continue with his sorties.  The trade imbalance never showed up in stocks? Won't foreign PO-Box HQ's turn up as if we were an island?  First, too much mess to last, thin ice.
3125 2018-06-15 16:58:50 Have a good weekend everyone. Don’t forget it’s Father’s Day coming up, get outside and enjoy summer ladies n gents. Overall a very good week on the market.

3127 2018-06-15 16:58:21 @StocksNCrypto Hi Stocks, I'd like to interview you on FACE. Best regards, Dale Pinkert
3128 2018-06-15 16:58:14 Yeah, I gathered the same thing...it is pretty common for tokens (or even stocks) with low prices to have large intra-day swings.  Your chart verifies that.
3129 2018-06-15 16:58:09 Add a Ban on bump stocks, raise age & do background checks and you have a great plan
3130 2018-06-15 16:57:56 Do you mind if I ask what was the success ratio of trades approx % returns in first year?
Did you trade index or stocks?
Cash, futures or options?
Thanks,

3134 2018-06-15 16:55:12 I wonder if we'll be able to look at an SSBU match with one character at 200% and one at 50%, and with the same amount of stocks we'll actually be able to say which player is in the lead

3140 2018-06-15 16:51:44 That's funny, I'd like to read the opinion of those financial advisors just to laugh about how they can come to the right conclusion for the wrong reasons.  That aside, ETFs are for most people indeed a more suitable investment than single stocks.

3144 2018-06-15 16:47:15 I wouldn't buy them because I don't buy single stocks, but also because the majority of financial advisors are saying to pass on them.

3146 2018-06-15 16:46:14 TSLA started rising before the release of positive news. Stocks go up when there is more demand than supply for the issue. With 31% of a very tightly held float out in shorts, it doesn't take much to make the shorts uncomfortable. Then they buy.
3147 2018-06-15 16:45:59 Odey Sees Rising Shares of Shorted Stocks as Sign of Correction
* most shorted names have risen by almost 30% in 2m's,  the correlation between this happening and a market correction within six weeks is more than 80%.
3148 2018-06-15 16:45:55 I didn't claim anything different. I just mentioned this fact because you mentioned revenue. I have my own reasons not to buy IBM stocks. Other people might buy them because "their growth doesn't reflect their innovation and company strenth accordingly".
3149 2018-06-15 16:45:10 (2/2) I invest when I believe the conditions... are probably not permanent... you can't be short-term oriented with this investment philosophy. If you're going to worry about short-term volatility, you're just not going to be able to buy the cheapest stocks. -- Rich Pzena

3155 2018-06-15 16:43:56 Everybody buying options , in Spain is difficult for us to buy options of USA small-mid caps . I have stocks of $SOGO at 10,68$. I saw this movement 2 weeks ago when it broke the 10$ resist. Now heading to +20$ like $BILI

3157 2018-06-15 16:43:39 Equity isn't working capital, so it effectively puts zero strain on the company until the option is exercised. Plus, the company can issue stocks and dilute share value rather than buy back stock to cover the option.

3164 2018-06-15 16:37:37 I can agree with stocks but when people mention percentages and how that can affect a players combo game and decision making especially on obscure match ups (especially smash 4 since there are so many MUs) it shows a great amount of game knowledge, all imo Ofc.

3169 2018-06-15 16:35:04 because they're the ones keeping it alive. They're the sole reason a company can continually exist. And still, stocks aren't a democratic tool. It;s oligarchy. Whoever can buy the most shares, decides. Why should an *outside* investor get more of a say than the actual workers?

3203 2018-06-15 16:16:24 The importance of diversification is known only in a bear market. Till then, betting big seems to be the obvious choice.
Having the guts to see stocks fall 50% in a few days are not possessed by many investors who think they have em - concentration has that behavioural risk.
3204 2018-06-15 16:16:02 Oh. Stocks. The graphs are stocks. The stocks are the “torture” device there and stocks/stockyard are where they’re building the ship there.
3205 2018-06-15 16:15:17 Gold, oil and EUR/USD all adjusting lower big time this week. Such moves probably are meaningful one way or the others. But what that means for stocks is anyones guess.
3206 2018-06-15 16:15:15 It's very hard to invest based on such risks other than decreasing net exposure from inflated levels and shorting stocks of weak co.'s. 2/

3221 2018-06-15 16:09:41 The catch is that the corn market will be extremely sensitive to yield, at the currently pivotal ending stocks estimates. The USDA's increase in old crop demand gives some buffer on production. We will still have opportunities, IMO, take advantage of any for those reasons.

3244 2018-06-15 15:58:45 yea.. both $IQ and $NFLX are opportunities for the short term. They arent affected by trade talks but the stocks are being affected.
3245 2018-06-15 15:58:25 I know some young people are worrying about the crypto bubble bursting, but worst case scenario we can always go back to trading biotech penny stocks, which in many ways are just like cryptos – but for old people

3249 2018-06-15 15:57:06 I have invested in other businesses, stocks, opening IPOs and I have never seen delivery like this. It doesn’t move me. To me it’s kind of ghetto but that’s just my opinion. If folks like it great but I’m good... thanks for the link!
3250 2018-06-15 15:57:03 Because of the tariff, as he announced stocks started to crash .So people sold their safe heavens to cover the loss. .That drive the price low
3251 2018-06-15 15:55:08 Depends on what you mean by "the market". The S&P 500 is just a portfolio of 500 large stocks chosen by a committee. It's a market. Not the market.
3252 2018-06-15 15:54:31 yes. US stocks will be the last shoe to drop
3253 2018-06-15 15:54:17 Other stocks obey the $NDAQ when it orders them to go down but #FANG says #NO
3254 2018-06-15 15:54:10 flight to safety is now on MJ stocks $CGC $CRON $APH.CA etc instead of gold and miners
3255 2018-06-15 15:53:57 It is not illegal to seek asylum, It is like how some CEOs take their salary in stocks so that they pay the capital gain rate of 15% instead of the top rate of 39%. I may disagree with it but they are using the system we have in place!!
3256 2018-06-15 15:53:46 $FNSR  Part of uncovering value opportunity in stocks is assessing management capabilities/dedication.  Knowing a sector well, e.g. contacts in the industry, can be a critical component.  Hurlston & Adzema = 4.5 stars.
3257 2018-06-15 15:53:43 For years now I've been using the phrase "I'm so old I can remember when Dennis Miller was funny." The first hint I had something was going sideways was in 2000 when he still had his HBO show. He had Al Michaels on... and they talked about stocks. Stocks. Not football, stocks.
3258 2018-06-15 15:53:38 If possible please give out reasons why you think so, it will also help us analyze stocks better.
3259 2018-06-15 15:53:09 Ah peut-etre. Mais j'ai souvenir d'avoir vu des stocks de pip-boy du 4.
3260 2018-06-15 15:52:15 Stocks are obviously tied to earnings and Bitcoin is entirely tied to sentiment. BTC going up with S&P in 2017 was just a coincidence, YTD S&P is up 3.51%, BTC down >60%. No correlation at all

3267 2018-06-15 15:49:25 I look at a day like today a HUGE buying opportunity. The Market as a whole is hot. Rather than chasing the winners, I use opportunities like today to build a position. #Bull #Stocks $SPY $ADBE $NVDA

3271 2018-06-15 15:48:07 Stocks go deep into the red on news of possible Trade War with China based on US imposed Tariffs on Chinese goods.  MBS is up 3bps and Yields slipped down to 2.91%
3272 2018-06-15 15:47:54 yes it oos atm. we ordered months ago that’s why we have stocks.
3273 2018-06-15 15:47:12 I don't trade stocks any more but holy crap does $AMZN look toppy. Plus my dad, who's new to investing at the ripe age of 60, keeps trying to convince me to buy in...even now.
3274 2018-06-15 15:47:05 I agree that most here are momentum investors. If you manage others money ur mind tends to.maximize the returns. DIY mostly don't have patience,when stocks fall fear sets in.

3277 2018-06-15 15:45:12 (1/2) When I talk about the companies I invest in, you'll be able to rattle off hundreds of bad things about them-but that's why they're cheap! The most common comment I get is 'Don't you read the paper?!' Because if you read the paper, there's no way you'd buy these stocks.
3278 2018-06-15 15:45:06 With the flow of funds data showing that retail investors continue to prefer bonds over stocks, who is the buyer of stocks in this market? The answer is corporations. More than $190 billion in stock was bought back in 1Q18 and almost $800 billion will be bought back this year.

3282 2018-06-15 15:42:24 $STUDY reduced my scanning tools to be more granular, more picky on what to trade.  Scans now produce LESS stocks, but the BEST stocks.

3284 2018-06-15 15:41:53 The stories associated with value stocks are generally going to be poor. There will be myriad reasons why any given stock is currently out of favour. It is exceptionally difficult to resist these stories, and instead focus on whether the bad news story is already in the price -JM

3301 2018-06-15 15:35:13 The problem is not your AR though. The problem is easy ACCESS to ARs. You people fight every restriction (univ BG checks, reg, waiting periods, bump stocks) so the majority eventually has no choice but to take its own action

Although, #tokenizedsecurities could be revolutionary, switching an asset to a blockchain does not guarantee an increase in value. Stocks, bonds, etc are representations of assets.

3321 2018-06-15 15:31:36 Ummm, okay. GDP >4%, unemployment down, stocks healthy, economy vibrant. I don't care for the guy's behavior, but it's a trifle premature to say his Presidency has failed.

3333 2018-06-15 15:25:26 We should have all white billionaires sells their top 1% preforming stocks to black billionaires/millionaires at the price they paid for it. That still wouldn't even come close to closing the wealth gap, but it's a damn good start and seems a lot more logical than outright giving
3334 2018-06-15 15:24:46 @mutou but where futures need to go is where stocks also likely to go.  NQ  trading weaker then ES for now for first time in almost 2 wks

3337 2018-06-15 15:24:13 DOW went down because defense stocks went down after denuclearization talks with NK. It's still higher than it was before Trump.
3338 2018-06-15 15:24:12 Actually it isn't just salaries, tell them they cannot trade on the stocks of companies affected by legislation they're working on, that'll drain the swamp and remove opposition to term limits.

3347 2018-06-15 15:17:51 This method works for putting potential multibagger stocks in radar. Future multibaggers make 52 week highs and then keep making highs year after year.
Trick is to catch them early when they make 52W highs first. Many which made 52week highs in 13/14 are multibaggers today.
3348 2018-06-15 15:17:50 US imposes tariffs on China, EU plans imposing tariff on US next month, China might also retaliate soon.. EU starts tapering, INR depreciates by 1%+ today and @68.4 already.. Good buying prices coming again in stocks..

3355 2018-06-15 15:15:14 This is why i invest into coins that provide dividends or staking rewards, no need to cash out ever!! It's like stocks with dividends, no need to cash out, we can live off of the dividends!
3356 2018-06-15 15:15:03 Absolutely. There are enough laws over the last two thousand or so years to cover all crimes. What I’d prefer are ten or so laws and judicial discretion. As in “Thou shalt not cause distress to another.”  Upskirting=stocks, murder=ten to life. Easy.

3359 2018-06-15 15:12:17 IF U WERE THEY 9?  So, for Jim this does "not" mean buy the stocks. This means buy the CALL Options.  IF "right" and the timetable works this is the PLAY.  But, this is not for the faint of heart. For those buy the stocks and you will do well.  There are rumors about!

3367 2018-06-15 15:08:25 Right, because somehow an index of 30 stocks couldn’t possibly trade differently than an index comprised of ~500. That is truly impossible.

3496 2018-06-15 14:28:25 There is at the moment a flight from cash flow and financial health to growth and recklessness. The story of “the next big ___” is driving unproven growth stocks higher. Established staples of the market seem shut out and forgotten.

3506 2018-06-15 14:23:39 1% Savings Hikes Can Spice Up Retired Life by $1 Million Not as easy as this sounds: money managers tend to take 1-2% a year of what your gross is, and they do it monthly. So 6% probably less then 4% return unless market jumps or you really watch and change stocks - they do not.

3535 2018-06-15 14:14:53 US stocks are the US economy only in terms of GDP which is a metric that doesn’t capture real underlying econ activity since money was divorced from labor and the production of goods & services, becoming fiat currency. If there is a monetary reset, your corollary is impermanent

3628 2018-06-15 13:37:45 True Zafar bhai. Intention was not on 10k per say. It was to focus on big single bets in one's portfolio and not to diversify in 20-25 stocks. There should be a Sehwag as well as Dravid in ones portfolio.

Instead, study human nature and the signs of a fragile environment heedless of risk. These have been occurring for all of human history.

3687 2018-06-15 13:08:31 You'd be safe!

With assets of $1M, you'd have a 2.5% withdrawal rate, which would work in all historical periods (even w/ a 60 year retirement) assuming 50% stocks.

You'd have the same 100% success rate at a 3% WR (meaning you could spend $30k / year instead of $25k).

3764 2018-06-15 12:30:28 It would be great if weak hearts quit direct stock market investing & invest only in MFs. These guys like herd pump money based on some recco,create bubble on even good stocks & when market correct these also correct coz of fear in general mid,smallcaps.

3877 2018-06-15 10:44:01 I also agree with 3 stocks in SSBU

You are exactly right. @GOP @USSenate losing preexisting conditions will kill ppl.
 Forcing breadwinners to stay in jobs because they have loved ones to protect.
Stocks? Environmental damage, irreversible for not regulating. Death toll on Trump & You. Save humanity
3879 2018-06-15 10:40:14 It is a dilemma because herein could be the opportunity, buying stocks nobody wants, assuming that changes at some point. I enjoy reading Howard Marks and he would probably say stick with SA Inc if I read him right. But I get your strategy, which may well be prove to be better.

3886 2018-06-15 10:33:16 That said, player depth would be helped by introducing new teams one at a time with two to three seasons between entry. Allows each new team a lone shot at the best established players on the market and gives junior and second tier stocks time to rebound after first team enters.

3962 2018-06-15 09:23:36 Yep! Or how about bringing the old (village) STOCKS back for 'naughty children' - punishment AND public humiliation. Modern stocks could be easily constructed then placed in prominent locations in towns & city centres!

They ARE illegal.
So called bump stocks do not make it fully automatic. People rant & rave against things they know nothing about.

4119 2018-06-15 06:56:48 Assuming the final build is smoother and plays faster I think 3 stocks makes sense for a variety of reasons. Some will argue for 4 maybe but I think 3 Stocks is fine, It would literally be between Melee and Smash4 lol

4121 2018-06-15 06:55:27 Find out who owns the stock in these companies. Bet a paper trail will trace back to the WH cronies closest to the clown - is that not insider trading if stocks purchased just before these children being kidnapped from their parents at the border?

4210 2018-06-15 06:00:18 Alternatively, you can see it this way. If you want to short stocks, short EM instead of $SPX. Shorting $SPX is a tough game to play.

4223 2018-06-15 05:48:49 that what me and my friend were talking about and if discovery help the game even faster it’ll be 4 stocks
that my opinion
4224 2018-06-15 05:48:47 The scoreboard would be way less hype if it was only 2 stocks. 3 or 4 should be the amount.
4225 2018-06-15 05:48:31 4 stocks didnt seem bad for the inv but I then again tourneys have way more players.

4228 2018-06-15 05:47:10 With the speed that Smash Ultimate has, I think tournaments should be 3 stocks.
4229 2018-06-15 05:47:09 That a good way of looking at it, maybe it has been an 'opportunity' to not have money in this market (and especially not to have leverage). The wheel turns though and at some point the under 5 P/E stocks with little debt will go up..
4230 2018-06-15 05:45:08 Why smallcaps are risky? Let me give small example:

I bought Ramavision(recco from somewhere) at 26.19 Avg Price.

They distribute Pigeon brand etc all I fine.

As usual I'm cautious guy who doesn't over commit,I bought only 14 stocks & started watching it.

If it rise also
4231 2018-06-15 05:45:05 i hope they have stocks of sla and hyyh pt 1 today 
4232 2018-06-15 05:44:15 The game looks like it’s geared to be more aggressive as it rewards that style of play, probably more so than Sm4sh. Increasing the rule set to 3 stocks I think would easily compensate for that fact. I think 2 stock matches will eventually get to short.
4233 2018-06-15 05:43:48 I'll bet Tom Steyer is heavily invested in military stocks. After all, he's a Neo-Liberal.

4252 2018-06-15 05:27:16 It would be true if the price is fixed and reflects a well defined product.
These things are traded like stocks and fluctuates depending on what the company does, what did you expect...

4282 2018-06-15 04:54:56 I realise we all talk about stcks we hold.

4306 2018-06-15 04:36:59 Well if looking for an actual answer, it's because it doesn't convert semi-auto to auto at all. Semi-auto means one trigger pull = one bullet, and a bump stock doesn't change that. Bump stocks assist in pulling the trigger faster, which can be done with other objects or practice.
4307 2018-06-15 04:36:47 La méthode ultra libérale est toujours la même, individualiser l’échec, libérer sa communauté friquée de toute responsabilité collective.Semer la zizanie pour créer des clivages profonds dans les" stocks".

4385 2018-06-15 03:49:47 Ah misread NCREIF as NAREIT. NCREIF, or private CRE, interestingly has had a lag relative to NAREIT and stocks. So historically provides diversification benefit simply due to timing. Whether or not it’s true diversification is in eye of beholder, but I think perception is reality
4386 2018-06-15 03:49:22 Please ban bump stocks. Innocent people being killed is too high a price to pay

4514 2018-06-15 02:14:40 The ignorance is strong with that one. The military does not use bump stocks. Assualt weapon is a made up term with no real definition.
4515 2018-06-15 02:14:27 Haha saving your money and putting it into rrsp’s and stocks makes money. Not gambling it on sports.
4516 2018-06-15 02:14:12 you know Trump is the only one putting out fake news.  He's gonna ban bum stocks, raise age limits on weapons, put more restrictions on Russia, and, well I could go on forever, but Trump is the only real FAKE news.
4517 2018-06-15 02:12:34 Lol I’m not talking about stocks and bonds tho. I have ETFs doing more than 10% every few months. I’m not discouraged about real estate. Passive income is all good in my book.
4518 2018-06-15 02:12:06 Yes!  Get in line with the "market." Stocks talk. We must "listen!"
4519 2018-06-15 02:11:58 @TheBull_Stocks, @LamountainDavid and @ShortSqueezed1 you three together find some amazing stuff there are many others but not trying to blow up everyone's feed Haha

4523 2018-06-15 02:09:22 Why-why won't #bitcoin & #Cryptocurrency die like exaggerated headlines say, instead it recovers, again, and again, because if #bitcoin crashes, so would stocks and other markets, correlation exists now.

4527 2018-06-15 02:06:26 I assume he's talking about things like how MIC stocks went down after news broke about the war exercises

I'm Korean. Watching the media do its best to attack this full force has been disgusting.
4528 2018-06-15 02:05:55 Like gun reform? Bump stocks? Listen Senator, I’m on your side, but this nonsense has to stop, I get you’re in the minority right now, so focus your energy on something you CAN accomplish, help Dems take back control, photo ops aren’t effective
4529 2018-06-15 02:05:51 The Dems are horrific on war.  That is my point.  I'm not saying this brings us to peace, this nation is far from that dream.  I'm just not going to shit on one of our simmering ready to go when stocks need to rise pre wars having cold water thrown on it.
4530 2018-06-15 02:05:22 i can see how the fees can intimidate someone into not wanting to invest into real estate. the alternative is managing it yourself or investing that same money into stocks and bonds with a average return of 5-10%. risk tolerance and participation come into play but we got options
4531 2018-06-15 02:05:07 I remember buying superconducter stocks in 2000, and having them rise $300%. 

In one week. 

This market has elements of craziness, but it isn't 1999/2000. It will be fun to watch the next 12/18 months. 

The T/TWX deal is significant, and could lead to a consolidation boom.
4532 2018-06-15 02:04:09 I believe you and @BigCheds spent sometime with Penny Markets & so you are the best people to see same patterns repeating here! Only players changed but most Pump & Dump strategies are same! However the scale here is large compared to stocks! Something can pump for billions here
4533 2018-06-15 02:01:44 If you were to look at all my trades, you would very quickly discover my predominant rule: buy strong stocks that are breaking out after periods of consolidation. #asx #trading #charting #weekendcharting #tradingphilosophy
4534 2018-06-15 01:59:33 So tired of the complacency that takes place every day. If you see something or hear something wrong, speak up. Speak out against injustice.
4535 2018-06-15 01:59:31 There is very little which isn't extended.  This is usually a sign we are due for some type of giveback.  This is not the time to chase extended stocks.  This is also not the time to exit your winners due to fear of a giveback.
4536 2018-06-15 01:57:39 It sounds easy enough. Just buy a few stocks. Can you give me a number on how many millionaires there are from buying single stocks?

4539 2018-06-15 01:54:42 its services that handle the landlord responsibilities and the fees are around 10% of the monthly lease. I'd have to run an analysis of the opportunity cost of not turning properties into passive income versus just investing in stocks
4540 2018-06-15 01:54:42 so many new traders complain about all the outside negatives that go with trading small cap stocks . Pumpers , offerings & criminal elements.  Answer pretty clear , stop trading them
4541 2018-06-15 01:54:12 And Uber stocks shrank 3 sizes that day...
4542 2018-06-15 01:53:39 No need for transparency with pot stocks

4544 2018-06-15 01:48:59 and buying back stocks, to benefit themselves even more & their boards.
4545 2018-06-15 01:48:07 No you have not.  Not one time have you stated the name or names of who you are.  On top of that, you do not know if the teacher has gone unpunished, we no longer live in a society where we put the offenders in the public square in stocks.
4546 2018-06-15 01:47:52 Sit in the naughty chair. Fired from a cannon. The stocks. Poison ivy. Ill-fitting shoes. Rude treatment in the archives. Library fines never forgiven.
4547 2018-06-15 01:46:56 Clearly subjective, but my reading of the tape is a mkt that is dragged higher by fewer stocks, $$$ going into stocks that haven't moved (like consumer non-cyclicals). To my eye, it chugs higher and hits air pocket when it's sold. $SPX $NDX $IWM
4548 2018-06-15 01:46:22 Oh, is that the new one? The one where Jesus slams beers, drives a four-wheel-drive while adding bump stocks to the now 11 Commandments?
4549 2018-06-15 01:45:47 I'm probably the millionth person to suggest this, but invest in penny stocks to treat your depression
4550 2018-06-15 01:45:31 Mkt focused on media stocks but @Twitter $TWTR has been spiking on takeover speculation/turnaround fundamentals h/t @RichBTIG an early bull
4551 2018-06-15 01:44:47 Might be no chance but I still think we are being held back by #NAFTA fears and Trump's unpredictability. These fears are scaring off US, international and probably Canadian investors. One step at a time. Things are almost in place for a major run of Canadian energy stocks.
4552 2018-06-15 01:44:38 I got through with the stocks I wanted to buy today.  I’m so happy.
4553 2018-06-15 01:44:01 Note that spot CME futures today are down $.14/Bu from this week a year ago despite global corn stocks being down 40 MMTs! Should trade issues be sorted out by mid summer, a rather substantial rally will unfold thereafter... Dan Basse Ag Resources
4554 2018-06-15 01:41:20 I need help picking a few good pot stocks. Any help is appreciated.
4555 2018-06-15 01:40:27 @Parianas @Machiparu @Yurimawas escaping from slavery imposed by Europeans. The Kokama, says Stocks, arrived to the lower Amazon around
4556 2018-06-15 01:38:55 The key difference is that the Middle passage was deeply rooted as Chattel slavery which gave rise to stocks & bonds. Although some Africans were involved, they never took it to where it became as did any 1 else. Again. Chattel as a means 2 fuel an economy.

4558 2018-06-15 01:37:31 Thank you again
4559 2018-06-15 01:37:16 Great performance, but how are they any different from other ETFs with the same holdings? Also, aren’t FAANG stocks overvalued, as per Goldman Sachs?
4560 2018-06-15 01:35:52 Walt covers AT&T but like with many stocks we collobarate
4561 2018-06-15 01:35:25 Who knows. Trump is still trading stocks and it's always good to have insider information, or help out your donors, like the Koch bros.
4562 2018-06-15 01:34:47 Corn stocks/usage tightest since '74. Wheat stocks/usage minus China the tightest ever. Yet next 5+ days dependent on Pres tweet. I think we need a 4 day US Agriculture holiday starting tomorrow. Clients be grumpy if I just drink beer?
4563 2018-06-15 01:34:12 @JohnLegere Any news of the Sprint takeover I'm holding my stocks praying for a miracle.
4564 2018-06-15 01:32:12 Most Tata Group stocks over years are made to move in a channel. The moment it hits the upper channel, you will find a Rights issue announced and they transfer debt to equity. e.g. Tata Steel Rights a month ago.
4565 2018-06-15 01:31:38 Dude. You can make 3 and 4 baggas off $8 stocks too. 2.8 milly floater $NETE IS GONNA DO IT AGAIN. Watch it in am man
4566 2018-06-15 01:31:24 Taxes $40 a month at best. ISIS moves to a new location where the bombs are not. NoKo has all their bombs still.  Stock market only helps those with stocks, most can’t afford 401k.  ACA only helped people that couldn’t afford health care, so yay for hurting the poor.
4567 2018-06-15 01:31:14 ADRs have the Fx component and so the risk is a major sell-off in EM tomorrow and $ARS devaluation would impact ALL Argentinians ADRs. So while I don’t know about these specific stocks I don’t think they will value more than a major devaluation e.g. 7% on the peso.
4568 2018-06-15 01:30:28 the game is lacking combos and kill potential, dont see how its going to bode well with 3 stocks. people died faster in sm4sh
4569 2018-06-15 01:27:41 So, in trading, how would one be able to distinguish a bias from an assumption??

And then to mentally separate them so it doesn’t interfere with your trading?

Definitely curious on people’s thoughts.

4570 2018-06-15 01:27:22 Is that the stocks thingie?
4571 2018-06-15 01:26:13 Before Vegas (you remember, 600 people shot?), nobody heard of bump stocks.
4572 2018-06-15 01:24:58 Hot stocks is cancelled today.
4573 2018-06-15 01:24:46 Kinda incongruous with this last 10 years, no? FANG, Malone stocks, etc. 

Cash flows really strong but not paid out.
4574 2018-06-15 01:24:30 So True!!! In 3 months i've gone from thinking I can only trade stocks in the low single digits, to trading everything from $20 to $1700.  Opens up so many more opportunities to be successful.
4575 2018-06-15 01:23:39 I would argue that incrementalism is a false narrative. And c’mon. bump stocks are just a way to get around existing laws re: automatics. You really think everybody EVERYWHERE in America should have access to Uzi’s? Blacks? Muslims? Wife beaters? Ex-cons who served they’re time?
4576 2018-06-15 01:23:25 Ubos na stocks ko kaya maagang hakot na naman sa sabado

4578 2018-06-15 01:22:03 $hvcw Things, as we all know, don't happen overnight. Other stocks like $aagc have a lot of attention on them at the moment. But in due time, more eyes will see what we're on to here with this undervalued ticker! And hold tight peeps, the week's not over yet!  $srmx $upzs
4579 2018-06-15 01:21:29 Selling a losing position is tough but sometimes you just have to make the call.  Sold 1/2 of my HIKU shares for a 30% loss and will be selling the rest likely sooner than later.  Used the capital to diversify into US Tech stocks.
4580 2018-06-15 01:21:16 We use around 100 million tons of CO2 each year in various industrial processes, most of this goes to EOR. Which is why Carbon Out has been established to use this CO2 for more beneficial purposes; such as treating malnutrition and replenishing our krill stocks.
4581 2018-06-15 01:20:04 $NKTR i rarely trade stocks over $10. i wouldnt touch those.  only trading this because i understand the pattern
4582 2018-06-15 01:18:04 @RobinhoodApp what happened to the news feed on individual stocks? I didn’t realize how much I used it until the last couple of days - at first I thought it was just the stock I happened to be looking at- but now I see none of them have news.

4585 2018-06-15 01:16:03 @PressSec In the Bible, Jesus said: Suffer little children to come unto me, do not forbid them...NOT: Make little children suffer because I'm a vile evil xenophobic racist prick, heavily invested in private prison stocks.

4591 2018-06-15 01:13:01 I went to the gym to workout, left investing in stocks  why you can't have gym friends. My pump was all types of fuck.
4592 2018-06-15 01:11:20 Bump stocks are now banned in Delaware!!!
4593 2018-06-15 01:10:56 Was impressed with the companies pitching at the TSX Tech Investor Day today. There have been 30 tech IPOs in Canada so far this year. Canadian tech stocks have 5 year return of 20% per year. Go Canada!
4594 2018-06-15 01:10:51 So many stocks selected by Sandro are doing super well.
4595 2018-06-15 01:10:33 Once again for the slow people. Universal background checks, mandatory training, banning bump stocks and large capacity magazines would not prevent citizens from carrying handguns to protect themselves.
4596 2018-06-15 01:09:27 Health Insurance stocks, which have gone to a briefing with the widow of Sgt.
4597 2018-06-15 01:09:01 These two stocks selectedby Sandro are making nice profits for people who are in the elite group of PowerGroupTrade.
4598 2018-06-15 01:07:42 soooo….wheres all the $NVAX people at today from after hours yesterday saying how it'd run today?... point is there is much much better to play every single damn day. Stay away from that shit.!! you don't need to trade stocks under $5 on small accnt to make money learn options!
4599 2018-06-15 01:07:27 I don't talk much about stocks I own because I believe its bad to constantly talk about them. I'm just sitting and riding the trend $STUDY

4603 2018-06-15 01:05:41 Most of your predictions are good ones... but I don't think lately just how good this economy is doing Trump will keep stocks going higher.

4609 2018-06-15 01:03:02 Ban bump stocks. And ban a--holes from twitter.
4610 2018-06-15 01:01:40 Or perhaps when talking about Argentina they refer to the 50 people that trade in stocks, bonds and dollars on a daily basis? Then again, I was always a bit of a tin foil hat wearer.
4611 2018-06-15 01:01:19 the point is that its easy to make money in a bubble. you buy and do nothing. It is very hard to make money in a bear market, which we are clearly in…Many of these insta-traders will be washed out forever by the end of it… Happens every time… in crypto, stocks, in everything.
4612 2018-06-15 01:00:57 Once naa na sa #ASYARD akong items.  SRP na yan mga megs.. So samtang naa pay stocks attack n po. Kay natagong pa sa mnl atong mga raw materials tungod sa panahon.
4613 2018-06-15 01:00:34 I'd buy bank stocks that were priced around $0.01 pre bailout bill and worth $3.00 a few weeks later, post bailout bill. And I'd invest heavily in bitcoin.
4614 2018-06-15 01:00:23 Ban bump stocks.
4615 2018-06-15 01:00:09 How to choose stocks for #swingtrading

- Have a basket of non-correlated markets
- Set up your rules/filters using a scanner

4619 2018-06-15 00:56:18 @BlackRockCA Hello, is there a reason why $XDGH is never moving up/down wether in my portfolio or in stocks app ? Is the ticker still active ? Is it because it’s a low volume ETF ?
Thanks for the info
4620 2018-06-15 00:55:57 If you wanna take some profits on $aka wouldn’t blame at this point, but as I mentioned it’s getting more and more exposure.

4629 2018-06-15 00:45:16 Irrelevant data, insiders are never smart money when it comes to timing the stock market. Netflix up 104% this year, Amazon up around 40%, Facebook set to explode over next 12 months, Lowest relative valuation in last six years, not the time to bail on the stocks
4630 2018-06-15 00:42:31 The topic that got me banned was on bump stocks.  They asserted it’s ok to ban them, they’re not a firearm.  Nor is ammo. But if you ban it, or individual gun components you ultimately end up with the same result.  Infringement.
4631 2018-06-15 00:42:16 De Niro is a Globalist puppet that sold his soul for fame and shekels.

4633 2018-06-15 00:42:06 thats sad to see from nintendo 7% of stocks just dropping thats just sad.
4634 2018-06-15 00:41:03 I’m not really saying it’s stable now, just more stable than ‘99. Concentration in the biggest stocks isn’t all that extreme today vs. history.
4635 2018-06-15 00:39:28 Strategy 

Oil stocks & oilfield services upcycle is still in the early stages and will get a lift from new orders and likely higher oil prices.
4636 2018-06-15 00:38:30 But seriously @LUFC I wanted an away season ticket before Bielsa. So did @awstocks   We had one when we were shit but then I selfishly had kids, can we have two more? 
4637 2018-06-15 00:37:58 Rick...

1. That's literally not possible when Trump was charging the Foundation for events at his properties. Full rates even.

2. The CF is not a pass-thru foundation. They do the work themselves rather than donate to charities.

3. CF is not a valid defense of the TF.
4638 2018-06-15 00:37:57 Guys like @carterthomas refer to it as “chart” technical analysis for that very reason. It’s just trying to predict movements based on patterns in a pursuit of short-term profit. In a bear market, you go long on quality. Moon boys should switch to penny stocks.

4645 2018-06-15 00:31:03 Stocks are like slave ships. They pile as many of you onto them as they can some by force some by misleading them & some because of plain oh' fear...Then they sink the damn thing with all of you on it. The key is when to know to jump ship or be on land when it sinks. #wallstgame

4648 2018-06-15 00:28:27 for one, if u're stuck with a low avg it means you didnt respect your risk. second, there is a BIG difference between the stocks u mentioned and the other pop and fade stocks i love to short. Vastly different fundamentals = different ppl trading them = diff price action.
4649 2018-06-15 00:27:13 Just remember it was Private stocks that soared right after the election-there's a reason why-it's all about the almighty dollar-making money off locking human beings up and causing misery happily -same here-so fucking sad

4660 2018-06-15 00:19:38 That's not even acceptable in rookie street stocks let alone the top sim racing series in the world
4661 2018-06-15 00:19:31 So, I'm seeing news articles stating that the cross-play debacle is finally starting to affect Sony's stocks. They're actually dropping from it.

Hopefully they'll finally get some of their business practices into shape because they've been awful about cross-play for years now.

4663 2018-06-15 00:18:08 A flurry of stronger-than-expected economic data also lent support to stocks, while investors were mostly supportive about the European Central Bank detailing a timeline for its bond-buying program, as well as its interest-rate policy.
4664 2018-06-15 00:18:01 US stocks mostly rose on Thursday, with strength in technology stocks driving the Nasdaq to its latest in a series of recent records, while weakness in JPMorgan Chase weighed on the Dow
4665 2018-06-15 00:16:38 In a way, yes. He hasn't divested himself from his businesses. He still has stocks. Every decision he makes can and does affect his own personal wealth and the wealth of his family.

4667 2018-06-15 00:16:05 I don't think so they have been pretty good about keeping up their stocks during a launch
4668 2018-06-15 00:15:41 Sessions owns stocks in private prisons that surveil and process these "non-white vermin"; that's "the law." Mammon expects total obedience and rewards obedience with cold hard cash.
4669 2018-06-15 00:14:41 How did they ban @zerohedge from owning stocks?   I think he has a self-imposed ban on owning stocks, because he fears a crash any day now (for the past 9 years, that is)
4670 2018-06-15 00:13:51 Yes but not stocks, crypto currency, banks are investing

4674 2018-06-15 00:11:16 I can understand why zerohedge doesn’t like the establishment.  They banned him from owning stocks.  So whenever fed prints money, it chisels at his wealth.  But what is everyone else’s excuse?

4678 2018-06-15 00:08:18 When #crypto becomes 'highly decentralized', as #btc and #eth are, it's not a security. ICOs, are usually securities according to hinman (SEC). This is vital, as securities have to abide to the same regulations as ordinary stocks.

This news did lead to a nice surge. 
4679 2018-06-15 00:07:18 we have enough Kangaroo jails here, I say put them in public stocks for 8 hours and let people go up and have one good bitch slap while saying, "what were you thinking"

4685 2018-06-15 00:04:12 5 - our quantitative easing props up wall street stocks & protects the secondary mortgage securities market from collapsing, theirs' is aimed at building progress for their economy;
4686 2018-06-15 00:03:51 No one has said that if you voted for Trump you're a racist. However, it IS true that all racists DID vote for Trump. As for unemployment and stocks, thank Obama. Look at trend lines. The deregulation from Trump admin has set us up for a huge crash.
