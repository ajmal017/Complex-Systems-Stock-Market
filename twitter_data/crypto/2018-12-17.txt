1 2018-12-17 23:59:52 I believe the 0 fee is just for the TRXMarket exchange isn't it ?

3 2018-12-17 23:59:48 $LTC, $TEL
4 2018-12-17 23:59:47 Of course. But it’s usually smarter to swim with the whales rather than against them
5 2018-12-17 23:59:38 Same format with its blood. The gratitude of the haunted plain behind him. #twitterbot #crypto #cryptocurrency #bitcoin #ethereum

8 2018-12-17 23:59:10 There is a non-trivial chance that crypto is going to start pricing in a global systemic bank failure. Bail-outs will be politically untenable, this time around. $BTC $ETH $LTC $XRP.

10 2018-12-17 23:58:58 It's over. It's been a traumatic, painful and bloody lesson, but the majority of Brits now get they were lied to for decades by crypto racists. The EU isn't a perfect club, and some of the members are annoying, but it is well worth the membership.
