0 2018-12-04 23:59:37 What are you thoughts on possible implementation? I'm thinking it is best to tax net revenue (profits) of oil, gas, coal, etc... Use the tax revenue to create a program much like NFIP to help insurance companies offset their liability in "500 year events"...
1 2018-12-04 23:59:29 He stuck his hands in her pants and checked her oil
2 2018-12-04 23:59:23 The oil industry has added substantially far more economic value in terms of personal and corporate tax than the auto industry ever has and ever will. I suggest Trudeau should do what ever is needed to get us fair market value for our resources

HR-1144 is laughably terrible legislation that will never pass because it is a bureaucratic, administrative nightmare and also legally questionable.

If you believe your great strides in improving our our environment include opening up our national parks and coast lines to big oil and mining, you're delusional.
13 2018-12-04 23:58:36 Since I stopped going to my dealer (Honda), I hardly pay anything for service. I used to regularly have bills of $300 or $400 and now I basically pay for oil changes and the occasional change of some fluid or other.

38 2018-12-04 23:58:02 Ignoring climate reports from your administration, easing the regulations for US oil and gas extraction and making 'friends' with / being a puppet for - the worlds two other largest oil producers. Seems like you're on the right track for creating a cleaner environment #fossilfool

41 2018-12-04 23:57:27 Its not the size of your wick that matters. It's how you oil it.
42 2018-12-04 23:57:24 to clean beef and remove salmonella just toss a couple kilo’s of ground beef into the tub - fill with 40 oz of water ( warm) and get your kids to stir in some oil - simply cook the mixture after soaking for 13 minutes (17 mins for well done ) and you got a rootin tootin party
43 2018-12-04 23:57:17 No, it doesn't - it's compiled from *INDIVIDUALS WHO WORK FOR OIL COMPANIES* and then donated to Beto. People have *jobs*; sometimes those jobs are for oil companies - especially in Texas. Use your head - this guy's a pot-stirrer.

45 2018-12-04 23:57:11 Hopefully the #HouseofSaud will do the right thing, alas we both know how wrong it is to make assumptions based on our upbringing/society, a trap so many fall into. USA, Russia and Saudi are primary producers of oil. Saudi Riyals purchase US Treasury debt!
46 2018-12-04 23:57:08 It’s time for an oil change and I didn’t particularly want to drive my car around today so my bestfriend came and took me to get some food 
47 2018-12-04 23:57:06 I've been thinking about Hanukkah. If they managed to get the lamp going for 8 days with 1 day's supply of oil. Does that mean that the ancient Hebrews invented the low energy light?

50 2018-12-04 23:56:42 I literally just season the chicken with seasoned salt,pepper, and mts dash garlic and herbs seasoning. Toss them in flour then fry in any oil of your choice. When it’s done frying add a ton of old bay and honey. And it’s done lol

53 2018-12-04 23:56:16 6.8% cayó la industria y 6.4% la construcción en el mes de octubre. Bajo la nafta y subió el gas oil. En lo que va del 2018 subió el 65% y el dólar un 100%, después es obvio que hayan 3.5 millones de niños pobres dijo unicef, pobreza infantil un 27%. Y un 20% sin derechos básicos

60 2018-12-04 23:55:37 I do remember that. We weren't talking about a world economic downturn 10 years ago, I was responding to suggestion Trudeau shrugs at Alta's problems. Bailing out car companies made economic sense then. You suggesting govt should bail out oil industry?
61 2018-12-04 23:55:35 Margarine is vegetable oil basically and Butter is a legit dairy product
62 2018-12-04 23:55:31 Every country has to buy and sell oil in US dollars! OPEC sets the price in US dollars and that is how everyone has to pay. If they don't then we and OPEC pump oil really cheap, pay people using the Fed Reserve who can print . Then forment a coup in the place not cooperating.
63 2018-12-04 23:55:26 How could they have that meeting without talking about the oil crisis? Just asking from Nova Scotia.

- Opposed taxing Wall St. transactions (HR 1144)

- Voted three times to increase Trump's military budget (HR 2810, 5515 & 6157).
68 2018-12-04 23:54:39 Fossil fuels. swhat a misnomer. Does anyone know how deep they drill to get oil? Try 26,000 feet. The deepest hole ever drilled was seven and one half mile deep, AND they had to stop drilling because the hole was so deep the sides would not hold steady. 26,000
69 2018-12-04 23:54:36 Venezuela ranks number 1 in oil reserves. Yet they are starving due to their socialism. BTW Exactly the government DEMS want for America
70 2018-12-04 23:54:35 And how many fires break out each year causing significant damage? Answer: very few. Heightened risk is best addressed by looking at controlled burn-offs and using chemicals instead (for example). What u don't do is throw the baby out with the bathwater (oil and gas ban).
71 2018-12-04 23:54:30 Is this about OIL AGAIN?

74 2018-12-04 23:54:25 For anyone who's never worn an air pack like that ( I did often in the oil patch).  It's a very different way of breathing.  Doing exercises like this would teach a firefighter how to break in a physically stressful situation under air, without exposing them to danger.
75 2018-12-04 23:54:18 But yet we keep buying oil from other countries and at a higher price. Get real.
76 2018-12-04 23:54:15 And the necessity of reducing our dependence on oil is a basic environmental reality.
77 2018-12-04 23:54:09 Me: "Wow I need to do two presentations I'm so stressed"
Also me: "Should I make a meme for this presentation about Aztecs bringing a bottle of extra-virgin olive oil to the top of a volcano"
78 2018-12-04 23:54:07 Stir in five grams of olive oil then bring to a boil.

81 2018-12-04 23:53:52 Having an oil loving globalist followed by an anti American POS that strangled the economy for 8 years is how we got Trump!
82 2018-12-04 23:53:32 You’re lying again. WE are the most polluting country in the world. We are not cleaning up other country’s pollution. They’re cleaning up ours. If you need to blame somebody, blame oil companies. Burning oil pollutes the earth more than any other thing.

85 2018-12-04 23:52:46 Not really timing the market. It's more timing the economy. When the 2008 crisis came there was a smell in the air, at least in Portugal. It was noticeable. And then the oil tanked for 6 months straight, not really difficult to make money there.
86 2018-12-04 23:52:46 He stood up, talked crap, tried to be "inspirational" but came across as a snake oil salesman and misrepresented almost everything that is going on. I don't like May's deal, but he had me supporting it by the time he finished. What an utter wank stain

90 2018-12-04 23:52:30 I don’t know what it is with people who won’t believe what’s in front of their eyes, in black and white! The amount of money Veto got from oil and gas sure wasn’t employees giving to his campaign!

94 2018-12-04 23:51:38 Organic would make no difference since organic is a construct used for marketing purposes. We arbitrarily decide what is organic in regards to farming methods & inputs. Air/water/light/temperature impact oil quality. That’s pretty much it.
95 2018-12-04 23:51:38 Trump will get them in line with him. Oil before US residents lives. That's the motto.
96 2018-12-04 23:51:34 Doc - take 3 1000mg fish oil pills daily. The healthful ingredient in a 1000mg fish oil pill can range from 300mg to over 700mg depending on what kind you buy. Can we be more specific?

103 2018-12-04 23:51:04 Another reminder: Rex Tillerson left @exxonmobil + showed up in our White House where he continued to work on the biggest deal of his career: the oil deal with Russia. Bet it was Putin's idea to have trump hire Rex and Putin would have paid Rex for lifting sanctions stopping deal
104 2018-12-04 23:51:03 Sooooo.... he's saying he would find some way to render the earth barren of life millions of years ago......cause that's what oil is made of.......

108 2018-12-04 23:50:19 Great strides on improving the environment! Putting oil and chemical industry executives in charge of EPA. Silencing government scientists from speaking on climate change. MAGA!
109 2018-12-04 23:49:52 Less than 2/3rds the value.    Revenue is the important part, not profitability.    $53 billion in revenue for them, $3-4 billion for us.    It's not our oil when they (foreign corporations) get 90%+ of the revenue.
110 2018-12-04 23:49:46 @TeaPainUSA  where does Tillerson fall in all of this? He has been quiet since leaving. The OIL man with existing ties to Russia fir a reason. Did he ever interview with the BOB? Something about him and his appointment  always smelled like old catfish.
111 2018-12-04 23:49:44 if only you were as hard on the corporate interests raiding the wealth of our workers as you were on the poor people seeking help from south of the border and the nations of the middle east who dared to have oil under their sand.

116 2018-12-04 23:49:23 I'd argue the problem isn't that the oil is running out, its that nobody wants it. Oil prices still haven't recovered since the 2014 Oil Glut, and when the US economy enters its next recession and demand drops again, that's probably the ballgame for the Saudis.

132 2018-12-04 23:47:37 While I do stand with Trump, I also can't deny that pollution is a subject that should be taken seriously. We have the means to have clean energy today. The technology exists. It's the big oil and coal companies that are lobbying to hold them back.
133 2018-12-04 23:47:22 hmmm mean you gotta look at it case-by-case. While I'm sure there are plenty of instances where Dems support corporate subsidies, there are also an ass load that are supported by R's. For instance many Republicans support contracts and deregulatory policies for big oil. They are

136 2018-12-04 23:47:05 My skin’s getting worse and worse I want to cry like I look at myself at the end of the day and I look like I dipped my face in a vat of olive oil

138 2018-12-04 23:47:01 @BingingWBabish brother, loved the new video. It jogged my memory, I wanted to find the video you did with the cold oil frying method for French fries. What video is it on? Keep up the good work man! Thanks for everything!
139 2018-12-04 23:46:52 Hummus always has tahini, olive oil, garlic, salt, lemon juice/verjus mashed with the chickpeas. Chickpeas alone don't taste like hummus. Hummus is disgusting, I love chickpeas tho in any other form. They are different.

Btw if i nk pakai aloevera should be bila eh 
144 2018-12-04 23:46:18 He didn’t take any corporate pac money.  The money Sirota is referring to is from individuals who happen to work in the oil and gas industry. And the money he raised was for his senate campaign where he outraised everyone so he’ll be #1 in a lot of categories.
145 2018-12-04 23:46:17 The Chinese must be laughing all the way to the bank... "look at this joker, Americans will pay his tariffs and he thinks he's punishing us?" It's not like even with tariffs we'll go somewhere else. Like oil, we're addicted to cheap labor, and they know it.

147 2018-12-04 23:46:00 Was this before or after Obama csl look ed out the oil and gas industry for complaining after he passed legislation enabling record profits? Stfu
148 2018-12-04 23:45:59 Kids: Hey the door doesn’t squeak any more!

Me: Actually, nothing in the house squeaks anymore!

Kids: Cool! How did you fix everything?

Me: Well, I-

Wife [from kitchen]: WHO USED ALL MY GOOD OLIVE OIL

Me: run
149 2018-12-04 23:45:59 I'm on this oil bro
150 2018-12-04 23:45:56 Mining of material is more harmful that - Exxon Valdez? Your sense of perception and proportion is also way off as well...

Solar panels are not has harmful to the environment as oil is - simple as that...
151 2018-12-04 23:45:50 lol 
Olive oil have nun on me
152 2018-12-04 23:45:43 Sakin effective. Kasi last month , sobrang lala ng oil ng face ko e. Ngayon moderate na. Kakaalis na ko ng walang pulbo 
153 2018-12-04 23:45:35 Rupert

devils advocate:

lets say He did it, lets just say.

What do they expect, His removal to exile?
The Senators choose the next Crown Prince?

They cut off American oil supply?

shut down a base?

buy back American property?

 And yet, Saudi Arabia is happy with
154 2018-12-04 23:45:33 Again with your lies as you pat yourself on the back. The major cause of the price hikes was OPEC lowered production and oil exports from Iran halted which caused a 20% hike in crude. Your conclusion was and is total bullshit!
155 2018-12-04 23:45:29 Maybe not different than oil crudes. But different than most commodities that startups need.
If I'm a founder and I need an office, I know for sure I can go get an office, and have a sense how much I'll pay. >>
156 2018-12-04 23:45:19 Exactly how many oil pipelines have happened?  And you want less regulation?
157 2018-12-04 23:45:19 Haha rusty don’t you have a market to further flood with product? Go back to bed bud, this is the oil industry. Big man stuff.

160 2018-12-04 23:44:59 I'm not sure why you think ditching fiat would help.  Wouldn't it make more sense to just reduce the need for oil?
161 2018-12-04 23:44:39 Yep! Lol I’ve also tried evening primrose oil, dates, red raspberry leaf tea, bouncing on a birthing ball, spicy food.

164 2018-12-04 23:44:20 Lots of oil/gas in the AL/FL line area. My grandfather (and later my mom & her siblings) got royalties from Exxon for many years.
165 2018-12-04 23:44:19 Once GM starts producing all electric vehicles, you can start to talk about the charging stations that we'll all need, but right now we need cheap gas from your oil, not cheap talk.
166 2018-12-04 23:44:06 Oil pollutes the environment you dope
167 2018-12-04 23:44:06 Your point? @DineshDSouza is a tinfoil hat-wearing shit stirrer. I’m not sure if he knows he’s lying & just enjoys taking advantage of the gullibility of folks like you, or if he actually believes in the snake oil he’s peddling...
168 2018-12-04 23:44:03 @Congress @Senate @POTUS @WhiteHouse @RealDonaldTrump @NBC @CBS @ABC @CNN @MSNBC @FoxNews @CNBC Trump's ALLOWING:  OCEAN SEISMIC TESTING FOR: OIL IS GREATLY HARMING: WHALES, DOLPHINS, MANATEES, MAMALS!!!
169 2018-12-04 23:43:48 @RealCandaceO You are incredibly misinformed about Standard Oil. The prices they offered consumers only went down as they continued to grow; and by the time any anti trust legislation had come out, Standard had lost much of its market share to competition. #ignorant
170 2018-12-04 23:43:46 Jeez...O'Rourke was running a Texas campaign. There was always going to be oil money involved somehow. I do think the next POTUS candidate should decline to take money from the fossil fuel industry, but that's months away.
171 2018-12-04 23:43:37 He followed close behind. Having to brush the hair out of his face while facing the wind directly.

He looked back at the wreckage, assuring himself that the robot was indeed defeated, and not leaking oil into the ocean.

He looked back, increasing his speed to catch up to-

173 2018-12-04 23:43:28 When oil drops most everybody I know is gonna be up shit creek without a paddle

175 2018-12-04 23:43:01 George H.W. Bush is dead.15 million Muslims slaughtered for oil, Bastard burn in hell
176 2018-12-04 23:42:46 @RUFIUS1 is delighted - he’s sent Diana over with the slaves to give you an olive oil massage, by Bacchus! X
177 2018-12-04 23:42:45 Im gonna focus on the balancing act the Sauds are doing with modernizing/selling oil to the West and keeping favor with Wahhabist clerics. I'll talk about how that'll collapse once that oil runs out.
178 2018-12-04 23:42:40 This is factually false. Beto took zero donations from "companies." He received less than 1% of his fundraising from small donors who work in oil & gas, the largest industry in his home state.

By that logic Bernie received just as much from Big Pharma, defense, Amazon, etc, lol.
179 2018-12-04 23:42:26 But you insist on drilling for oil on federally preserved land. Then there’s the coal thing.  Finally what have you done to improve Flynt, Michigan’s water.
180 2018-12-04 23:42:25 The point is Sturgeon gives strong support to oil and gas extraction. That is not the message we can afford?
181 2018-12-04 23:42:18 Not kid of mine is gonna drink oCastor oil or chatha. That shit was not fun
182 2018-12-04 23:42:13 I have prepared a tostas for dinner with Serrano ham, oil, crushed tomato and two slices of Cheddar cheese molten above
183 2018-12-04 23:42:13 Would be interested to know what you have done to ensure clean air and water. Gutting environmental protections and attacking renewable energy seems counter-productive if that is your goal. Understand people in Flint still cannot drink their water, but oil companies prosper.
184 2018-12-04 23:42:10 What is the minimum price for every other input ? Say what is the minimum price for oil ?
185 2018-12-04 23:42:06 Jumping into bed, coconut oil really is magic for removing makeup, nite all you awesome kinky people 

Please let me have one of those dreams
186 2018-12-04 23:42:04 Even if the MAGAts want to ignore the environmental benefits of renewable energy, how 'bout one of their favorite chants, "JOBS"

ENTIRE US fossil fuel industry: 187,117. 86K Coal/52,125 Nat.Gas/36K Advanced Gas/12,840 Oil/Pet

Renewable: 543,721: 373,807 Solar/101K wind/68K Nuc.
187 2018-12-04 23:41:58 Trudeau could also revisit the requirement to include downstream ghg emissions in the EE assessment, something not imposed on the imported Saudi oil.
188 2018-12-04 23:41:56 We all start somewhere & we all used WD40 (it's not oil) to lubricate a chain at some point. Not everyone is interested in learning, but you seem interested at least in the basics. Regular preventive maintenance and cleaning can add years to the life of a bike, more so in winter.
189 2018-12-04 23:41:52 just use some oil babey
190 2018-12-04 23:41:50 it's bat shit crazy and their being a horses ass.

192 2018-12-04 23:41:37 Can confirm on the dry shampoo and motor oil at least
193 2018-12-04 23:41:16 Did I buy new boots instead of getting an oil change 100% but now I can just walk everywhere so people can see how good they look on me
194 2018-12-04 23:41:10 Sprinkle some sesame oil, and toss in your instant noodles are a separate packet, although in a precooked and coat with beef,
195 2018-12-04 23:40:59 You are correct, I think he wants to remove all of the coal and oil that is contaminating the planet, and burn it.
196 2018-12-04 23:40:57 Few drops of eucalyptus oil or tea tree oil in a bowl of boiling water, cover your head with a towel and inhale! Do it a few times it'll help clear the sinuses (momentarily)

200 2018-12-04 23:40:33 Lybia was going to create a gold backed currency to buy and sell oil! It was a direct threat to the US petro dollar. This is why Russia and Iran are receiving so much bad press. Both have oil and would like to buy and sell in another currency besides the dollar.

202 2018-12-04 23:40:31 CBD oil helps her greatly with way fewer side effects/addiction issues, and she lives where it's legal, but if she gets drug tested she loses her job because it's still illegal federally. I empathize with you so much. I'm sorry you're dealing with this.
203 2018-12-04 23:40:26 Thank you emiley for the great tip   Here, apparently, a lot of Malaysian students still prefer using  sunflower oil for frying. Let's spread the word for a better health care 
204 2018-12-04 23:40:24 Eat more 
205 2018-12-04 23:40:15 A ah, just that the food la i’m always out/always at work and had to eat as it is. I know that I can’t eat macam macam dah lapar makan jugak la lmao  yeah I have a gigantic coconut oil bottle on my table it’s my bff, my room smells like coconut

207 2018-12-04 23:40:07 Any real comparison between oil sands and lithium batteries shows that oil sands products, from extracting and processing to transporting and burning, are by far the most destructive.
208 2018-12-04 23:39:58 Y’all understand that mayonnaise is just eggs and oil, like I get not liking it but why is eggs oil and vinegar so divisive 
209 2018-12-04 23:39:47 We're in a diversified resource economy, but still resources based. Wheat, Canola, flax, potash, wood products, oil, uranium, cattle, pigs,...they are all cyclical. Not in crises, but always up and down. Oil only in crisis because the Feds are trying to kill it. For false AGW.
210 2018-12-04 23:39:45 Yay for oil money I guess
211 2018-12-04 23:39:32 Druff just have a cbd edible, all the benefits of pot without the psycho active component. Plus the oil is practically free.

216 2018-12-04 23:39:22 The rich men of oil should spend their money on the ill and poor of their countries instead of weapons of war.

222 2018-12-04 23:38:29 I do not believe things like this interest him.  His pathetic stance on immigrants is well chronicled.  And Saudi's prince equals oil money. I fear that his rhetoric is just becoming the norm for many Americans and there are few things more frightening to me than that .
223 2018-12-04 23:38:28 @SenBobCorker time to reign your executive officials who failed to take appropriate steps regarding Saudi Arabia.  Guess oil speaks loud!
224 2018-12-04 23:38:18 Sure, as OEM's plan to introduce like 200 different BEV's to the market in the next 5 years, Big Oil has nothing better to do than to kill Tesla via Twitter. Full Disclosure: I'm long $TINFOIL via HATs.
225 2018-12-04 23:38:04 Learned how 2 change my oil today!  now Jiffy Lube can’t charge me $75 no mo 
226 2018-12-04 23:37:59 And why would people in the Oil and Gas industry, who have much to lose in the short term  from fighting Climate Change on a systemic level, pledge large amounts of money to a politician if he wasn't going to be weak on the issue of fossil fuels?
227 2018-12-04 23:37:51 MORE OLIVE OIL
228 2018-12-04 23:37:50 They’ll need to to be Oil’d as much as possible 
229 2018-12-04 23:37:47 So you expect the President  to tell the Saudis: Enough! We don't want your cheap oil and your billions to buy our weapons and keep our stock markets afloat ! Good luck
230 2018-12-04 23:37:22 Your opinion is wrong.  Canada isn’t conducive to growing a “clean energy” sector. Snow, winter darkness and solar don’t mix. We protest hydro. We protest nuclear. We have more oil than almost anyone.  VCVR and TO are too expensive to live in, and good luck recruiting elsewhere.
231 2018-12-04 23:37:03 he would be the town idiot.
232 2018-12-04 23:37:01 Maybe everybody in Alberta is cutting their output in solidarity with the oil business ;)
233 2018-12-04 23:37:01 And it will all level out, if you think for one second the energy companies are in this to make things cheaper on you then you are a fool. Every business model on this planet is is designed to make the most profits possible. Gas, oil, coal, wind farms and solar.

235 2018-12-04 23:36:57 Qatar leaving OPEC in January 2019 to focus on natural gas. What can we learn from this about how the oil industry works? What are the implications for the industry and other smaller natural gas producers like Tanzania and Mozambique? https://youtube/obG_JG-fFCg via @YouTube
236 2018-12-04 23:36:53 If 90 per cent of oil workers were female, Canada would be Kuwait by now; there’d be pipelines running across university campuses, and oil would be described in government press releases as “milk for cars, carrot juice for jets.” - Rex Murphy
237 2018-12-04 23:36:44 Hell no! They were behind 9/11. They can shove their oil
238 2018-12-04 23:36:43 They presented at Cowen Conf… talked about weak fracking in N.A. along with belief it’s temporary and will gradually pick up in 1st half 2019, international rev inline.. volatility in oil prices may cause issues.. (shocker there).. good chance to see if it’s priced n stock.
239 2018-12-04 23:36:40 2 hours for an oil change!! Wtf 
240 2018-12-04 23:36:32 Or not hire Dowd.
241 2018-12-04 23:36:32 This administration is trying desperately to get as many wild herds off public lands as possible. They are destroying their trail and covering up their actions through propaganda and disinformation...Zinke is dirty as hell, and solely works for mining and shale, oil companies.
242 2018-12-04 23:36:25 "Nooo, Arnold, don't do it!"
243 2018-12-04 23:36:22 This guy came into my job to pay his bill he must of just gotten off work hes full of grease or oil idk and hes just so embarrassed telling me "I'm sorry I smell like work...I clean up nice." Dude that shit is ATTRACTIVE dont let no one tell u different 
244 2018-12-04 23:36:09 What to use in Lieu of Pesticides? Neem Oil, Garlic & Clove Oil, Azatrol, StrawFlower Extract... the list goes on!
245 2018-12-04 23:36:05 Goverment are giving grants for retrofitting and installing oil in older houses,yet they want to cut down on oil use to protect the environment,can someone make sense of that. #TonightVMT

249 2018-12-04 23:35:52 especially (my favorite noodles and co. dish) pasta fresca which is just noodles (carbs) in oil (fat)
250 2018-12-04 23:35:40 Look on Groupon. They have gummies and oil pens or just the oil itself. 
251 2018-12-04 23:35:35 As a schizophrenic, this would make me very happy since cannabis oil is proven to help fight the symptoms of my illness.

Also it has a good amount of medical applications in cancer treatment as well, so that helps!
252 2018-12-04 23:35:28 Carbon IS a poison when we get too high concentrations in the atmosphere. We better keep as much carbon as possible bound as coal and oil in the ground instead of evaporating it into the air through combustion. Our atmosphere is already sick of it...
253 2018-12-04 23:35:25 4/ The carbon dioxide is pumped underground into nearby oil fields to help extract hard-to-reach crude.

256 2018-12-04 23:35:21 That snake oil salesman - you gotta be kidding or delusional.
257 2018-12-04 23:35:20 Of course it will. But this isn’t about jobs. It’s not even about retaliation. It’s all an excuse to further enrich the oil barrons. Who will, of course, lavishly reward trump and his crime family.
258 2018-12-04 23:35:18 Well, God bless you! Not that it’ll make a difference, alas. I’ve been boycotting Exxon since the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Look how well that’s going! Lol. But seriously, thanks for being straight up. Every little bit helps! 
259 2018-12-04 23:35:18 And Bernie showed that you can raise a lot of money via small individual donations. So no candidate needs the oil executives' money, and I'd rather have candidates whose environmental policies would make them not want to donate.
260 2018-12-04 23:35:13 RT _chaipls: Saw this man near kulsoom internationl hospital metro station. He said he is graduate (BA) and had been working in some oil company for 20 years.

262 2018-12-04 23:34:50 The media who are using Bush's death to trash Trump?   In 1992 during the election between him and Bill Clinton called Bush:

An Adulterer
A warmonger
Said he traded blood for oil
Hated Blacks

Just to name a few.  So don't buy into the hype that the media loved him.
263 2018-12-04 23:34:46 Want a hot oil treatment & a protective style so I dont have to see or deal with my hair 
264 2018-12-04 23:34:46 I overheard girls in the supermarket discussing the fact that their mums used baby oil and it would make them burn faster. So they all bought a bottle. I couldn’t believe it in this day and time. Bring back the #SlipSlopSlap ads.
265 2018-12-04 23:34:32 I work at a car dealership, what I would recommend is buying the oil and filter have someone that knows how to change oil do it for you, you’ll avoid the labor and other fees they charge, which they charge ridiculous shit

271 2018-12-04 23:33:42 you and i are like oil and water
272 2018-12-04 23:33:41 i can’t stand when guys try to finesse me at any car place. tires, oil change etc. i’m not an expert but i know enough and what i came for.
273 2018-12-04 23:33:38 Sir, You and your oil company minions haven't done squat for the environment.
274 2018-12-04 23:33:37 Please explain. Exactly HOW have you been "making great strides in improving America's environment"? By rolling back clean air initiatives? By pushing for more dirty coal? By streamlining installation of oil pipes across our nation? By opening oil drilling in the ocean? How??
275 2018-12-04 23:33:36 KAI always cooks really spicy curry with a lot of chili oil to it... It BURNS!;;

277 2018-12-04 23:33:34 @Bojangles1977 Someone needs to go undercover and observe your location in Trussville, Alabama. The fries and bo rounds looked like they had been cooked in motor oil. And the sausage gravy biscuit was runny and the patty  was like a brick. $21 spent. For what
278 2018-12-04 23:33:30 I get a check each month from an oil and gas company. What’s wrong with that?  I also drive a hybrid and my house is 100% powered by solar.
279 2018-12-04 23:33:25 We have Eucalyptus oil?
280 2018-12-04 23:33:20 I should’ve got an oil change while I was out being extra
281 2018-12-04 23:33:13 Great strides? You buried the climate report, hired coal and oil guys and listened all regulations, lie!
282 2018-12-04 23:33:04 @cenkuygur @johniadarola #tytlive Ending the EV subsidies doesn't hurt GM because GM is close to hitting the 200k car cap (Tesla already hit it) so it would end for them soon anyways. Trump doesn't care that GM cut 15k jobs, only wants to help his oil donors.

285 2018-12-04 23:32:53 Ever Since I pre ordered battlefield 4 I decided never to buy another EA game again. What a surprise, you release another game which is unfinished, think about this while you look at your stock price
286 2018-12-04 23:32:50 Is he invested in oil though? If he was, he’s doing a real shitty job driving the price way down. Oil prices have been plummeting, can’t imagine he actively manages a fund invested in oil. He probably has a blind trust though.

I don’t mean this in a snarky way btw.
287 2018-12-04 23:32:48 I like alfredo, although it can sometimes be a bit runny and cheesy for my liking. I tend to prefer a garlic and olive oil sauce.

289 2018-12-04 23:32:35 I know nothing about cars, but sometimes I wonder why I pay for "full coverage" in my car insurance and don't get reimbursed for shit like oil changes and internal problems with my car.
290 2018-12-04 23:32:35 If @realDonaldTrump cared about Clean air and water he would stop subsidizing coal and oil and support all forms of clean energy and subsidize electric cars and hybrid vehicles.
291 2018-12-04 23:32:23 Rose essential oil is rare and precious because there is a whole effleurage dealie involved in processing it-and does it ever smell amazing.

Which colour do you gravitate to?
292 2018-12-04 23:32:19 Because I’m not acting ignorant of the fact majority of people working for oil companies aren’t executives making all this money. I’m also not the one acting so privileged that I believe everyone has a choice to not work for certain companies.
293 2018-12-04 23:32:11 Unfortunately no.  Are they still legal to manufacture?  There was a discussion of whale oil and other animal fats as lighting sources, but the physical example was limited to tallow.  It smelled like a beef on the grill.
294 2018-12-04 23:31:55 They are not fossil fuels ,oil is and has been nproduced by our planet without fossils ,for millions of years.
PetroChemicles have given us unprecedented prosperity and wealth that enables us to be the most charitable nation in history contrary to what you tell your followers.
295 2018-12-04 23:31:53 Cut the crap. French people are demonstrating because of a huge contempt towards business deregulation, against the closure of many administrations, because of a decrease of income and business taxes favouring the richer, and because of an increase of taxes on oil and other goods
296 2018-12-04 23:31:41 Any more oil and the United States will invade the pan.
297 2018-12-04 23:31:36 It would be 100 times better if they did it in a kiddie pool filled with vegetable oil, no?

300 2018-12-04 23:31:14 Coal does not equal clean air and water. Oil does not equal clean air and water. And now you want to pull subsidies for actual CLEAN ENERGY. Sad. #TrumpsterFire
301 2018-12-04 23:31:13 And to think, City went on to buy SEVEN players for more than what they paid for Sterling.

302 2018-12-04 23:31:11 Japanese uses karaage as a bento lunch; after they fried, they last longer for a few days. Is easy to make but its bit of chore with grease and oil throwing it out without clogging the sink and toilet.
303 2018-12-04 23:31:06 This isn’t about Trump you trolls. The Fed put this in motion decades ago for oil. Enough with the Trump bashing. Saudi Arabia was a problem long before @realDonaldTrump took office.
304 2018-12-04 23:31:00 I want to try the oil!
305 2018-12-04 23:30:52 I just wonder why oil executives and board members are seeing fit to donate to him. It means they want access.

317 2018-12-04 23:30:11 As of May 2015, he was the IS oil and gas division official for Al-Hasakah Governorate, Syria, serving directly under ISIL oil and gas emir for Syria Abu Sayyaf who was killed in May 2015. Prior to Abu Sayyaf’s death, al-Zahrani regularly transferred funds to him.
318 2018-12-04 23:30:08 In May 2015, he assumed control and oversight of car bomb production at the Rukaybah oil production plant compound. As of June 2015, he supervised an IS oil production plant in Rukaybah.

326 2018-12-04 23:29:30 I seem to remember ISIS terrorizing the West, but not Iran. 

Iran does not threaten to dominate the supply of Persian Gulf oil. Tillerson the oil man was ousted for being not anti-Iran enough. The US is perfectly capable of preventing this from happening w/o micromanaging the ME

331 2018-12-04 23:28:58 @CloudN9neSyrup makes CBD syrups that help with anxiety and sleep or you could try epsom salt baths with lavender essential oil. Sleep in the dark, in soft clothing and keep warm. I will smoke an indica strain if i'm desperate for sleep (or edible if you don't like smoking) 
332 2018-12-04 23:28:58 It's still fun though.
333 2018-12-04 23:28:48 Hamstringing the EPA and putting oil company executives in charge of it is making great strides for the environment?
334 2018-12-04 23:28:41 So, you've got the market all figured out, I see. Nothing else going on to affect it, like oil uncertainty, Brexit, the Fed, China uncertainty, French/EU unrest, insurance losses, profit taking, debt levels, year end selloffs, tech doldrums, etc., etc., etc.

344 2018-12-04 23:27:43 We are setting up a perfect storm for an oil rally of epic proportion & the longer the State/Trump keeps leaning on oil to artificially hold it down, the powerful the rally will be. I can see $100 oil by the end of 2020 which most probably would say is a dream at this point.
345 2018-12-04 23:27:39 I keep my distance naman kase sa screen ng monitor dati kaya di ako takot maghilamos haha. Pero kung sayo kuys pwede naman baby wipes basta ma-moisturize lang ang face mo at maalis ang oil.

347 2018-12-04 23:27:32 So you don't think big oil falls into the globalist elites bucket? That's bizarre...

349 2018-12-04 23:27:27 I think the oil services sector is telling us that enough oil wells have already been drilled in the Permian to satisfy demand for some time to come. There are tons of drilled but not completed wells just waiting for the pipeline capacity to come online in 2019.

368 2018-12-04 23:26:15 We import 80 K barrels of oil a day Down East from the Saudis because Trudeau screwed the Canada East pipeline to save his MPs' seats in Que. Refinery in Saint John could handle Alberta Oil. The Northern Gateway line was a PMSH project, and Trudeau didn't want him credited.

Neither you nor your adminstration have made "great strides" in improving America's environment. The only strides you've made have been in selling out to coal and oil while undercutting existing protective regulations.

377 2018-12-04 23:25:10 Actually - never. Oil demand is forecast to increase until 2040. Right now 100 million barrels per day is produced and transported. Research IEA. IEA has pretty cool charts by country that details what % of electricity generation is attributable to coal, hydro, nuclear, wind etc

380 2018-12-04 23:24:53 Tough call. OPEC+ may agree on cuts that boost the price of oil but if stocks continue lower, which I expect they will, it'll be a drag on oil too. Suffice to say that oil is a coin toss imho. Best guess is higher ST, then down to lower lows.

398 2018-12-04 23:23:13 Mr Trump, you are addicted to and obsessed with fosssil fuels. We have recently heard you congratulating yourself on low oil and gas prices. You are polluting, destroying and devasting the planet by global climate breakdown. Your lies and humbug are nauseating and unforgiveable.
399 2018-12-04 23:23:12 You Claim that "...production of solar cells is more harmful than most oil refining..." That is NOT what your source says in fact - the opposite. You should read your sources before using it as evidence...

What's your other source that supports your position?

407 2018-12-04 23:22:41 It's always the comfortable middle classes like Victoria White and her husband who want to tax the shit out of us. Try buying a few bags of coal and filling up your car or oil heater on a low income, you self-righteous toffs. #TonightVMT
408 2018-12-04 23:22:35 They always say “There’s more than one way to skin a cat...”, but no one ever says what they are!!
409 2018-12-04 23:22:33 Just remember: Cheaper stocks are like a tax cut for the American oil man. #Oil
410 2018-12-04 23:22:33 Or "Our oil & gas is magic. Stop worrying about it"
411 2018-12-04 23:22:32 Trump admin reduction of regulations only benefit corporate CEO’s, shareholders &’the President & other politicians paid off to pass them. NOT AMERICA. Ppl are dying EVERY MONTH from so called 500yr storms/ wildfires. Why? FOR GREEDY OIL & GAS COMPANIES
412 2018-12-04 23:22:28 Peta: "We just kill cats, we don't talk about it--that's unconscionable."
413 2018-12-04 23:22:12 Maybe they should kill a journalist or at least side with the killers and refuse to listen to facts like audio tape and their oil prices will drop a few cents.   It seems to have  worked 4 u.

417 2018-12-04 23:22:04 People have been criticizing Beto for a lot longer than just last week. Furthermore, I find it unsettling that you are not wanting to further question Beto’s ties to oil companies and his involvement in a GOP-laden “problem solvers caucus”.

422 2018-12-04 23:21:09 I know everybody is different and my conditions (Sjogren's, Thyroiditis, and Fibromyalgia) but I have found CBD oil useful to a certain degree. I have tried vaping it (hoping for a general pain relief) but found it useless. Using it topically has worked better (elbows + hands) x
423 2018-12-04 23:20:34 I imagine when I'm traveling I smell like moderately priced whiskey, motor oil, and dry shampoo.
424 2018-12-04 23:20:28 It's very hard for the oil companies to make Megabucks when electric cars are cutting into their profits. And the oil and coal industry cannot generate they're dirty air electricity, if solar and when power out does them. Just remember being paid by these type of companies
425 2018-12-04 23:20:22 If this is the current level then I definitely don’t want the next level because then people will be actually dying by the millions!! The nation that ship the most oil in Africa is also the poorest nation in the world, does that make sense to you @ProfOsinbajo??
426 2018-12-04 23:20:19 I need fuel oil for my furnace.
427 2018-12-04 23:19:59 Although the Man-at-Legs meat is a bit on the metallic side, the oil makes a mouthwatering gravy or lubricative vinaigrette.

432 2018-12-04 23:19:45 "Yeah, she's just having issues with her oil line so I'm trying to fix it. Though question is, why are you here?"
433 2018-12-04 23:19:43 If it’s such a concern then maybe we should seal the border... prevent us from leaving, that way no asymptomatic carriers go overseas and bring diseases back. We should also all don positive pressure hazmat suits and replace our bodily fluids with motor oil, for good measure
434 2018-12-04 23:19:32 So, I should stop saying "let's hump this donkey" when it's time to get something done? How else am I supposed to motivate my family?!
435 2018-12-04 23:19:30 think in tiny steps in treating your body & mind better. self improvement that sticks, takes time.

443 2018-12-04 23:18:57 Senator its the behaviour of One. Who is the bedfellow of your President's son in law. Campaign to remove him and reinstall Mohammed Bin Naif, or even Muqrin, that way you can still maintain your precious relationship with oil, and end chaos. Just saying.
@LindseyGrahamSC
444 2018-12-04 23:18:55 i hate that the biggest threat to my well being is that a bunch of oil execs told a bunch of racist nerds to make computers that can make more racist nerds and it worked
445 2018-12-04 23:18:55 I'd love to see the U.S. protests if we stopped subsidizing gas and oil.
446 2018-12-04 23:18:41 For real?  Coal mining, new pipelines in Alaska, drilling for more oil, opening new steel factories, backing off Paris climate change agreement. Is this how you protecting the environment you lunatic? Clean water, clean air my ass you Trumptard.
447 2018-12-04 23:18:37 Trump certainly wants clean air and water on his golf courses.

The rest of you can just pay tax money to prop up the oil and coal industries while denying climate change so, I guess you should take Trump with a grain of polluted salt.
448 2018-12-04 23:18:34 That is why you opened the Alaskan wilderness for oil exploration, because you care about the environment?
You can't have it both ways Donald, no matter what Fox and Exxon tell you.
449 2018-12-04 23:18:30 do you use cbd oil and if so, is there one you suggest?
450 2018-12-04 23:18:28 Every tweet is a new lie. You are doing everything in your power to destroy the environment while helping your oil buddies.

454 2018-12-04 23:18:06 You full of Sh%@t and an incredible science illiterate. How do you think the air will be clean with all the pollutants in the air due to deregulations and push for burning more fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, natural gas?
455 2018-12-04 23:17:50 This is blatant baloney, Sirota. These are individuals who happened to work in oil in..... Texas. Get off it. We're not stupid.
456 2018-12-04 23:17:47 Growing economy means 100,000 unemployed oil  workers but that’s ok with Trudeau it’s in  Saskatchewan and Alberta not in Quebec
457 2018-12-04 23:17:40 Proof?
458 2018-12-04 23:17:34 Exactly!
Today taking the form of what we recognize as the G7, a 7 headed Beast which had an alliance with 10 kings of oil producing kingdoms in Middle East & Northern Africa comprising ancient Babylonian/Persian Empire, after WW2 as 10 horns!

468 2018-12-04 23:16:52 Why do you think oil prices are so low?  Of course Saudi Arabia is complicit.
469 2018-12-04 23:16:48 Without the Arab oil money, City are basically Peterborough.
470 2018-12-04 23:16:40 American taxpayers shouldn’t have to clean up the environmental disasters caused by your coal, oil, and natural gas polluting donors, Individual 1. We know they own the piece of you that hasn’t already been coopted by the Russians and Saudis.

472 2018-12-04 23:16:20 Supply&Demand. As the #Supply of #NonRenewable Coal, Oil & Gas dwindles, yet global #Demand for energy continues to rise, prices will skyrocket. Clean, #Renewable energy is the way of the Future. Failure to embrace that revolution would leave us stuck forever in the past…
473 2018-12-04 23:16:15 Lip Service that's why you opened up our national parks and lands for Oil drilling.  What a bunch of Bull $#!t!!!!
474 2018-12-04 23:16:08 There’s no need to go crazy with applying oil, and the media to begin asking questions on their behalf.
475 2018-12-04 23:16:08 These oil rich princely Arabs were living in camel skin tents until recently, they have side stepped the path to civilisation.

478 2018-12-04 23:15:50 YOU have put our nation and it’s people at risk by denying scientific climate change, and putting us back 75 years by supporting coal, Oil, and other polluting fuels, when you could actually bring us into the future and create jobs in wind & solar power, increasing clean air,
479 2018-12-04 23:15:44 and oil lightly after evry use
480 2018-12-04 23:15:44 These efforts will create millions of new jobs and save families and businesses money on their monthly energy bills. We will transform American transportation by reducing oil consumption through cleaner fuels, vehicle electrification increasing the fuel efficiency of cars, boiler
481 2018-12-04 23:15:38 You’re lying again Donnie.  Water in Flint Michigan still undrinkable. YOU have DEREGULATED ALL SAFETY MEASURES so now oil drilling & SONIC SOUNDS in Oceans will KILL ALL SEA LIFE. You’re a FRAUD & a CON whose MAIN INTEREST IS THE BILLIONS YOU CAN SUCK OUT OF RUSSIA & SAUDI.
482 2018-12-04 23:15:36 Yes. Says I. Enemies of oil are heat, light, oxygen & water… regardless of the oil, it will oxidize over time.

486 2018-12-04 23:15:32 This is so frustrating. If we must subside oil & gas, then tell the industries to use billions of dollars in subsidies to start shifting over to green trainings/infrastructures/renewables or go at it themselves without subsidies. Think that would make a nice dent in emissions.
487 2018-12-04 23:15:30 So then like Rex Murphy do you also believe that Climate Change is not caused by human activity? 

I’m ok with protecting our industry, giving our oil away for next to nothing is a lose/lose. But how would you transform the oil industry to green energy investment?
488 2018-12-04 23:15:25 I want cannabis oil and I want it NOWN

491 2018-12-04 23:15:13 You have done everything to pollute our water, our air and our environment. Other countries are doing better than we are. You’re increasing oil lines and drilling, you are pushing for a coal comeback, both of these are dirty energy. Youve allowed increased auto emissions....
492 2018-12-04 23:15:10 Good on cutting subsidies for renewables while not cutting them for the oil companies.
493 2018-12-04 23:15:08 Saudi, Russia and Qatar together can seriously hold the world economy hostage and run a cartel that runs both oil and gas. No direct loss for the US that is domestically self-sufficient, but Europe and all other consumers would suffocate, and suppress all non-oil markets
494 2018-12-04 23:15:06 Dear Mr. President, so you'll be ok when Alberta puts a $40 a barrel tariff on export oil as your country sponsors protesters that have land locked our resources and lost $6 Billion so far and growing at $80 Million daily? Seems fair, we are friends after all. Fair prices 2 ways.
495 2018-12-04 23:14:51 Thank you! and oil, I am not a fan of acrylics haha! I recommend putting a version of the photo u are doing under a see through sheet protecter and matching colors to get the right ones it helps SO much and also many layers build them up!

Me: Yes they did, please show me differently.
You: They'll never survive without subsidies.
Mark: Remove all oil subsidies, too.
You: Average person can't afford the car.

Are you purposely moving goalposts? Or do you not see you do this?
502 2018-12-04 23:14:17 Cleaner air and water? How is subsidizing coal and oil helping clean the environment? 
503 2018-12-04 23:14:16 The "where is my lard" is ... very extra lol. Russian teaches you "butter" and "oil" instead lol.
504 2018-12-04 23:14:05 But I thought you were a tariff man? Surely the protests have nothing to do with anger over rising oil prices because  of the tariffs you placed on Iran. No way, not a chance. Maybe the protesters should take it up with you instead of Macron, you very stable genius, you.
505 2018-12-04 23:14:03 So thank you for you pedantic point.
However every other application for petroleum, from white vinegar to polystyrene, are environmentally toxic as well.

508 2018-12-04 23:13:47 Yet the taxation of around 98% of oil in U.K. waters is allocated to Scotland. 

Clearly another great fact they’ve got wrong. ;)

You do know that there is no export tax, right?

Oil is a declining industry.
511 2018-12-04 23:13:41 The Kochs pump tar sands from their Canadian oil lease to Wood River Illinois to be refined to gasoline. It's then sent downriver to New Orleans to be sold out of the country. America is a conduit. Like for their Russian money laundering schemes.
512 2018-12-04 23:13:41 Just earlier, I applied oil onto my sword so it has great sharpness. If you touch it even slightly, your fingers would be cut and blood could spill.

518 2018-12-04 23:13:01 You're right Trump, the U.S. should be paying for OUR own pollution, our use of coal, oil, and fossil fuels as well at the very least! Great idea! Let's charge those oil companies BILLIONS now!

527 2018-12-04 23:11:54 I don't know a lot about it, but I do wonder if renewables can really replace jobs at the same level of pay and skill as offshore oil & gas, where you get paid such a high premium for being stuck on a rig for a month at a time.

535 2018-12-04 23:11:02 So your idea is to burn all the oil and gas you can get hold of until it runs out, and we'll be ok because then there will be no more emissions ? Brilliant !!!! Utter delusion

542 2018-12-04 23:10:35 With your sanctions on Iran made the price of a barrel of oil rise. which made the price at the pump rise. Only when it started to effect your base  you decided to lift oil sanctions. You never look at long term effects of your actions just short term and it all goes wrong.

544 2018-12-04 23:10:27 Yes low gas prices are nice but it also reflects unstable oil prices which drives the economy.  #unstabality
545 2018-12-04 23:10:14 My mentor, a fellow cro he's 84 now, when i asked him about industrials when I first started he goes in the cro english accent - industrials all BS. stick to mining and oil because its in the ground. He's worth $20million, and he started in 1978.

547 2018-12-04 23:10:10 It's possible to have both. You should get up to speed on Norway for example with sovereign wealth fund and huge investment in / R&D for renewable including hydro and electric charging points. Being an oil producer and driving a green economy / renewable forward also, can work.
548 2018-12-04 23:09:46 ありがとうございます(*´艸｀*)ｧﾊ♪
549 2018-12-04 23:09:41 "Other countries polluters"...it's like Tariff Man doesn't know we all live on the same planet & have to share the same air. Meanwhile, he wants to punish elec makers & loves coal/oil burning, instead of investing in solar/wind tech that would reduce carbon emissions.
550 2018-12-04 23:09:38 Спасибо большое,это очень красиво
И отдельное спасибо за поздравление (это в двойне приятно!)
Глаза у меня к сожалению не такого яркого цвета

552 2018-12-04 23:09:37 Reversed an Obama ban on drilling for oil in the Arctic.
Ignored a deadline to implement a rule regulating smog.
Reversed a ban on plastic bottles at national parks.
Repealed a ban on lead bullets. The bullets were banned under Obama because the lead can poison wildlife.
553 2018-12-04 23:09:36 Warm bath with rose oil. Smoothes ouw with coconut oil. Feeling refined
554 2018-12-04 23:09:33 Have family in Alberta, lived in Ontario for 25 years. Life is a roller coaster. Gotta know when to get off. Oil is up and down for 50yrs. SURPRISE!. Oshawa knew this was coming 2yrs ago! SURPRISE! NO PRODUCTION PLANNED PAST 2019! THEY KNEW! Feel bad for them though.

うん！
560 2018-12-04 23:08:58 Yes! I learned a lot about solvents due to the chemistry knowledge behind stain removal. <s>Because keeping your cloths clean and stitched together is only for one gender </s>
I think you should know how to change a tire and your oil if you drive a car. & If you wear clothes? :)
561 2018-12-04 23:08:22 Spaghetti with (vegan) butter and a ton of nutritional yeast or rice with sesame oil + rice vinegar + soy sauce + nutritional yeast. Basically hot carb with fat and salt.
562 2018-12-04 23:08:18 I was one of those construction men for 20 years. Oil rigs, trucking and pipeline installations all over Alberta were my work. We paid cash for meals, tools, clothing and of course food. Thanks to our prime minister for his flawed opinion of us. Now we know.
563 2018-12-04 23:08:17 Great. Whales would now be extinct. Getting oil out of the ground literally saved them. Amazing how making people angry at a commodity makes some dimwit losers feel so good about themselves.
564 2018-12-04 23:08:14 You are being disingenuous and you know it. I don't think it's an attack, because there is nothing in this to attack him on. "oh, Beto took money from people who work in the oil/gas biz in Texas, some of them pump gas for a living"  I do, however, think it's a cheap trick.
565 2018-12-04 23:08:03 Oil trumps honor, so to speak!
566 2018-12-04 23:08:00 Try doing it as a scrub next time, it shouldn’t stain. I used turmeric, honey, sugar, and apricot oil and liked it for the helping with dark marks
567 2018-12-04 23:07:55 This cbd oil has me so relaxed I’m not even arguing with anyone while on the road.. I’m a changed person
568 2018-12-04 23:07:54 So how does removing subsidies for electric cars help make the US cleaner? You promote coal and oil and punish clean energy and we are supposed to believe you care about the earth? Clean earth in the future won't benefit you and Trump only cares about things that help Trump now.
569 2018-12-04 23:07:44 Funny thing, I just read that the rise in prices was because of your threat to other countries who bought Iran oil..so hoarding drove up the price. When you backed off the price came down. Just one more time you cried wolf Donny

581 2018-12-04 23:06:48 Dont be stupid. We are NOT dependant on the Saudies for oil. In fact we are quite independant and that us a good thing for the US.
582 2018-12-04 23:06:46 It is also products that are competitive world wide and pushing for cleaner future. Start cutting hundreds of billions of oil money first, it’ll make EVs look cheap.
583 2018-12-04 23:06:45 folk [fóuk] （複数形で）両親

My folks are both in the oil business down there.
僕の両親は石油ビジネスをやっているんだ。
584 2018-12-04 23:06:44 Oh, bullshit! You want the exact opposite! That's why you opened up federal parks for mining and oil and gas exploration, reduced the size of Bear's Ear monument by 80%,  rolled back environmental regulations and pulled us out of the Paris accord. #FakePosPotus
585 2018-12-04 23:06:39 @VassyKapelos @PnPCBC 
You keep insisting that the purchase of TMX by  government (us!) somehow is helping the oil price collapse. How exactly? Again, not one incremental drop of crude is leaving the province. The soln is THE EXPANSION OF TMX. 
This concept is ignored or lost.
586 2018-12-04 23:06:24 20M/year but you sell oil I love you
587 2018-12-04 23:06:22 Heck that was fun to do!
588 2018-12-04 23:06:14 The most artificial club that has ever existed. No history until they struck oil.
589 2018-12-04 23:06:11 The current "president" of the US is a disgusting, vile traitor; treasonous piece of shit; lying wannabe crime boss; sociopath sex predator; embarrassing & cheating fraud who will go down in history as a fat orange snake-oil-pushing conman. I despise & blame the MAGAts for this.
590 2018-12-04 23:06:03 Once again, development of things to help the average American get the screws put to them. But, big business can continue 2 be helped. Oil make $ BILLIONS. COAL is Trump's small job creator. Yup, they need help. Electric cars don't use gas, a product of crude oil. Get it Trumpies
591 2018-12-04 23:05:58 Gas here is 2.10 a gallon. Not a great signal to keep oil in the ground.
592 2018-12-04 23:05:55 Yep our MP Hue Merryman is voting for the deal, yet the area voted to leave, voted Tory all my life but will never vote again as what is the point. MP vote for own self interest like Greg Barker, now CEO of Russian oil co. Remember the picture with call me Dave and the huskies
593 2018-12-04 23:05:49 さすがにやばいと思った…。今日から早めに勉強してすぐ寝ます……
594 2018-12-04 23:05:48 The Russian oil companies will do whatever Putin tells them to do. We have done this a few times since November 2016.  They sqwak, no agreement, and then everyone agrees to the Saudi proposal. Same playbook different meeting.
595 2018-12-04 23:05:45 which essential oil will make me pass my finals
596 2018-12-04 23:05:41 How? By putting an oil lobbyist in charge of EPA? Cutting regulations put in place to keep Jack ass co.from dumping poison in our air and water? Off shore drilling allowed on ALL coasts (except Fla) Trashing national parks? HOw?.
597 2018-12-04 23:05:35 Puréed navy beans with broth. Stir in oil, Parmesan, Black pepper, and whatever else. Good with olives, cream, etc.
598 2018-12-04 23:05:16 Oil pens give me headaches I mean the glycerin in them
599 2018-12-04 23:05:12 Because of oil, we have a better standard of Living, longer lifespan, clean water, clean air, A house, a car, schools, and better “MEDICATION”   Denying this standard of living to our children and grandchildren is to send them back into the pass where living was harsh.
600 2018-12-04 23:05:04 もうちょい寝る時間増やそ？()
601 2018-12-04 23:04:59 You’re heavily invested in oil. You have no interest in cleaning up our air and water.
602 2018-12-04 23:04:58 You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
You'll never drill for oil on a city street
I know you're looking for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
But there ain't no Coup de Ville hiding at the bottom
Of a Cracker Jack box
603 2018-12-04 23:04:46 These really delicious crackers called "Fire crackers". Theyre baked with ranch and red pepper seasoning with olive oil. So good!

607 2018-12-04 23:04:26 It doesn't smell that bad, you're just exaggerating. I wouldn't say boiling beans smell amazing, but it's definitely not as bad as you're describing it. Once it's cooked and you add sesame oil plus fried coffee, the smell is so good, it will make your mouth water!
608 2018-12-04 23:04:23 Crisco the best oil to fry in dont @ me
609 2018-12-04 23:04:14 Wouldn't it be more profitable to take industry money and try to disprove global warming? Doesn't Oil and Gas have a lot more money than pro-environmental organizations? 

How do you claim to know what thousands of people (scientists in fact) are thinking? Are you psychic?
610 2018-12-04 23:04:14 You put an oil guy to head up the EPA, you got rid of the CAFE standards for cars, you say that global warming is a hoax, you now allow coal mining to dump waste into rivers, you've opened up protected lands to drilling. "great strides improving"? You must be kidding or an idiot.
611 2018-12-04 23:04:07 Put the oven at 450°. Toss the snap peas in olive oil, salt, and pepper. Roast for about 10-12 minutes, pull them out, sprinkle parmesan on top and put back in the oven for 3 minutes. Done.
612 2018-12-04 23:04:02 めちゃ眠そうやん？？
613 2018-12-04 23:03:58 May we be blessed with

Hearts as wicks that are easy to catch aflame, and yet somewhat manage to stay aflame. To stay aflame 

Appreciation of the match, whose short-lived beauty doesnt stop it from trying.

615 2018-12-04 23:03:49 If I offered you $25.00 off CBD Oil would you give it a try? Yes or No? 
I still have a few gift cards left!
616 2018-12-04 23:03:47 Nope. He received donations from employees of oil/gas-related companies. That would include for example, a gas station attendant or a mail room clerk. People in Texas work for oil/gas companies (including Democrats). People in NY work for finance companies (including Democrats).
617 2018-12-04 23:03:40 Follow the money, they essentially work for big oil & gas, it's a threat to their power structure.
618 2018-12-04 23:03:38 Did anyone tell them about her plans for “Oor oil?”
619 2018-12-04 23:03:30 Selling oil to the Nazis to own the Redcoats.

623 2018-12-04 23:03:20 I literally cut my bangs hoping they would be curly like they were prior to cutting them and had the actual thought "they'll be like Andreas bangs that's cute" but now they just frizz up and cover my forehead with oil so
624 2018-12-04 23:03:19 おはありぃ…！
625 2018-12-04 23:03:06 Really....your EPA appointees all work for big oil and coal.

Liar
626 2018-12-04 23:02:58 Sooooo fun teaching Callen Leahy & Ellen Mahoney had to add oil to the car over FaceTime (in the dark:). They are hilarious!! #girlsrock
627 2018-12-04 23:02:56 Half bag of rice 8k , 4litres oil and groundnut oil 4K. Maggi , onion and seasoning 2k. Yam and plantain 2k. Garri 3basket 1800, bean 1 basket 1500. That’s 19300 still have change for extra expenditures. So na till February.
628 2018-12-04 23:02:48 Can we stop pretending we aren't dependent on fossil fuels please? There is an environmental impact to most industry and O&G is no exception.

What are "short term" economic benefits? What do you consider "short term" because there's enough oil up there to go for a looong time...
629 2018-12-04 23:02:48 Everyone must report who employs them. So the receptionist who works for Goldman Sachs is presented by lying Berniacs as a GS contribution. Ditto the guy pumping gas at the Exxon station is aggregated with all the people working top to bottom as a gas/oil donation
630 2018-12-04 23:02:47 おはよ！
631 2018-12-04 23:02:46 Tried to talk work into doing a #secretSanta where palm oil and plastic were banned. As if finding anything not shit for under a fiver wasn't hard enough...
632 2018-12-04 23:02:44 Because it is.

Why is it that even oil companies have run studies that agree with climate change as an existential threat to humanity? 

They spend so much money running misinformation campaigns and lobbying government to ignore it, why do their studies confirm it??
633 2018-12-04 23:02:40 Oil not the only explanation. Nor is vol. also some fundamental/technical deterioration within credit, independent of what equities have been doing
634 2018-12-04 23:02:31  Line sold $268 million worth of the oil vadapavs.
635 2018-12-04 23:02:30 Oh no more insults from a dishonest con artist who uses people’s insecurities to steal from them. Not sure twitter is super concern with insulting lying snake oil salesmen who lie for a living. Have fun dying alone. 
636 2018-12-04 23:02:28 Pls give me my oil ya

638 2018-12-04 23:02:15 What are you using? Are you using the oil oil gummies or pen? I have the pen and it’s been working wonders
639 2018-12-04 23:02:10 I wish I could take the oil from my face and distribute it to my legs. They are soooo dry.
640 2018-12-04 23:02:06 The #LiarInChief has taken every possible step to worsen the environment from promoting coal, opening up more land to oil drilling, removing ecological protections.  He and his cronies are creating a new and more toxic swamp.  #ResignNow
641 2018-12-04 23:01:57 I read lies, lies and really stupid lies! This is just so backwards and ridiculous that only the truly deluded fact free portion of his base would buy this snake oil.

644 2018-12-04 23:01:34 i went to get an oil change and they didnt charge me, i'm so confused 
645 2018-12-04 23:01:27 Snake oil salesman says people who've stopped buying his snake oil welcome to keep buying his snake oil..go figure.
646 2018-12-04 23:01:26 I bet that was the staffers job of a lifetime. Think about it. There work consists of shopping, or waiting in a lobby with coffee and a doughnut while a mechanic is changing the oil. 
647 2018-12-04 23:01:26 As the miracle of Hanukkah celebrates the oil that lasted for 8 nights & the light that shined forth, may your life be filled with the brightness of the menorah’s candles. I hope these 8 nights bring peace & joy to your home & family. Wishing you a Hanukkah full of beauty & light

650 2018-12-04 23:01:20 No. Pharma, oil and weapon manufacturers literally lobby and pay off politicians to get policies passes by government. Look at the climate change denial which was started by the big oil firms shooting down the actual science that burning fossil fuels is harmful & then buying...
651 2018-12-04 23:01:16 Yes it was just that. You people have gone so far as to price check Bernie's winter jacket, but now you call this a "smear"?
If Beto was so pure and not sold to the oil companies, he would be out there just like Bernie to try to save our lives. Where is he?

659 2018-12-04 23:00:30 Could not be further from the truth. Try eating  10,000 calories of rib eyes, butter & mct oil a day. Ketones will be flowing, but youll be much fatter in no time. Calories matter. Keto just triggers satiety so u are less inclined to overeat. But you can absolutely gain weight.

661 2018-12-04 23:00:12 They don't care about the global economy. The only one that matters is Oil, Coal, and Gas. As long as those three make money they will deny till they die.
662 2018-12-04 23:00:10 It's like trying to bring culture into the devil's den, like oil & water they don't mix
663 2018-12-04 23:00:05 Then stop cutting subsides on electric cars and alternative fuels so your friends in the coal and oil industries can get even richer.
664 2018-12-04 23:00:04 The oil is still present in the vines even when the leaves are gone. Fun fact: you can get it from the smoke if you burn it. Even in your lungs
665 2018-12-04 23:00:01 Excellent & hard-truth point about the snake oil salesman known as Bernie, and I'm so stealing that "Jeopardy Music" thing......  
666 2018-12-04 22:59:55 Re: #Day on @PnPCBC ‘Let the private sector take care of the oil issue responsibly and sustainably’.

667 2018-12-04 22:59:55 Who is going to give a shit about Pals then? Their backers wont have any leverage once oil is inconsequential.
668 2018-12-04 22:59:54 I have sent emails to Neil Laurenson about the finite resources of the world. Energy is the only one we need worry about - hence the interest in nuclear fusion, but too much oil and shale gas mean there is no urgency for that yet.
669 2018-12-04 22:59:54 By cutting back on national forests and reversing oil drilling protection laws? Dream on.
670 2018-12-04 22:59:54 what the hell is an oil diffuser
671 2018-12-04 22:59:48 Talk about pros and cons of building an oil/gas pipeline from Fort Mac to Churchill (tidewater)
672 2018-12-04 22:59:45 Good question! The oil is tested for cannabinoid content and potency. In all of our oils THC is undetectable. We use state of the art High performance liquid chromatography testing equipment.

674 2018-12-04 22:59:34 The world greed for high oil prices is appalling. There are other resources to make money.The world shouldn't be relying on only oil to make money.nothing but greedy countries to hold the world population hostage by forcing the price of oil to raise the cost of living.

677 2018-12-04 22:59:25 We are all part of the same planet and some in other countries already breathe China's polluted air, you idiot.   You've given mining and oil companies free passes to contaminate our oceans, fresh water and air because you don't give a damn.   It's all about big money.
678 2018-12-04 22:59:18 I wouldn't want to be sitting on property in Albert till oil prices stabilize.
679 2018-12-04 22:59:17 6/ Funnily enough, if Govt had required cleaner petrol engines, a little UK company called Rover (which did a load of work on something called lean-burn petrol in 70s & 80s due to the oil shock) might have capitalised.

682 2018-12-04 22:59:02 They are actually paying to clean up ours. Plus the USA is ripping through oil reserves at a humongous rate.
683 2018-12-04 22:58:56 That’s exactly the point you just somehow miss it. What “big pharmaceutical” do to control medicine and what big oil do to control oil l, Apple and Facebook can do to control speech and political narrative. There’s no world where that is a good thing for anyone except ideologues
684 2018-12-04 22:58:51 According to a press release from @NicoDujovne Ministry of Finance, YPF & Petronas will invest USD 2.3 bn in shale oil Vaca Muerta (dead cow) oilfield for the next 4 years. This will be the 2nd largest direct  investment in shale oil in Argentina

The oil sands do have tidewater access and the price difference is due to tarsands crud being very expensive to process.  Oh, and the "crisis" comes out of Alberta's gross mismanagement of the resource for decades.
690 2018-12-04 22:58:36 Your climate goals would lead to a +5.1 C increase if the world followed your lead. You are killing the Earth one pipeline and one oil subsidy at a time. Shame on you.
691 2018-12-04 22:58:28 Sorry I missed it. My position has been long known, as I presented it to Rep John Anderson at a talk he gave in Herrick Chapel @GrinnellCollege in early 1979. A resource tax on petroleum products would help wean the American public off of oil.

711 2018-12-04 22:57:03 What does that mean in terms of numbers? How does that offset pollution equal to 1 million cars per ship?

712 2018-12-04 22:56:57 (Dont hate me ) I do agree with you statement, but, in Aberdeen anyway it is the oil companies that are putting alot of investment into renewable energy. Trump took the Scottish government to court for putting wind turbines in the sea near his golf course !!!

724 2018-12-04 22:55:48 Very true, my year of chemical engineers graduated as the oil price collapsed and many fewer than usual went to blue chip chemical companies.
Must pick you up up one thing, the financial crisis is not over, the government is still using it as an excuse to cut public sector pay.

754 2018-12-04 22:53:18 You're right there. But palm oil is becoming ubiquitous, and biodiesel isn't a large %age of production. Biodiesel is a daft idea in almost all scenarios.
755 2018-12-04 22:53:10 1st: verify that oil exists.
2nd: verify that oil is flowing.
3rd: test pressure measurement devices
If you have no flow, it's not pumping.
If you have no pressure, it's leaking.
756 2018-12-04 22:53:07 If they can't ship it out why AB do not invest in new refineries?

758 2018-12-04 22:52:55 Most likely oil, it rainbows like that.
759 2018-12-04 22:52:53 So explanations of why rates rallied do have some cross-asset validity as well. Ok, then I’d say oil, tightening financial conditions, and decelerating cyclical economic indicators are all relevant to markets

768 2018-12-04 22:52:26 You’ve provided no evidence that oil companies wanted Beto to win, or that they took steps to make that happen by pressuring employees to donate. Declaring it “obvious” is not evidence.

813 2018-12-04 22:47:13 How is Canada raiding your wealth? We purchase more from you than you purchase from us. We sell you our oil and electric power. We do not treat you unfairly. You make no sense.
814 2018-12-04 22:47:12 Does your original tweet tell the common person reading it: Wow Beto is great at fundraising everywhere? OR does it more likely, & possibly inadvertently tell the common reader: Wow Beto is bought and paid for by gas & oil money?

Me: What seems to be the issue?

Santa: I hear the Sleigh bells jinglin' - ring ting tinglin' too

Me: I see you're about 15,000 miles overdue for an oil change
816 2018-12-04 22:47:04 Cool, all the progressive faculty and admins are working for free!
817 2018-12-04 22:47:02 Plus DT opened up federal land for drilling.
BO locked that all up for oil exploration.

Not a wise administration.

821 2018-12-04 22:46:23 We can’t kick oil for renewable sources or nuclear because then everyone else will buy it at an inexpensive cost-greedy assbackwards international politics
822 2018-12-04 22:46:19 . Too little too late, nationalizing Alberta’s oil is a socialist answer not a made in Alberta solution.  Five more months and put with the NDP!!!!
823 2018-12-04 22:46:11 387 wants an oil change *SQUAWK*

827 2018-12-04 22:45:43 I was going to get so much done today, but it’s taking two hours to change the oil in my car. Fuck. 
828 2018-12-04 22:45:41 A gallon of industrial strength Patchouli oil.
829 2018-12-04 22:45:37 If this is a lie it would make me not want to get my oil changed at the grease pig... it's like selling me a hungry man frozen meal but I get a baby portion... false advertisement!
830 2018-12-04 22:45:28 Getting to drive two different cars is cool and all; until 1 needs gas, the other needs brakes, and both need oil changes #JustInTimeForTheHolidays

832 2018-12-04 22:45:24 @MeyerResources Ma'am, watched your analysis on AJ about why Qatar quit OPEC...I love your submission of the relevance of oil at least for the next decade. Great analysis.
833 2018-12-04 22:45:17 i bought some fresh peeled garlic in the store and i  dont think ima use it all much soon so i decided to try roasting it in grapeseed oil and s&p
834 2018-12-04 22:45:02 my Christmas list:
1. An oil change 
2. A band saw

5. New backpack 
6. Everyone’s constant love and adoration
835 2018-12-04 22:44:57 Some tea tree oil and a scrub brush
836 2018-12-04 22:44:52 She doesn't notice over the sound of her bike suddenly kicking on from her messing with the starter switch and oil spits out onto his coat, then she kills the switch and starts tightening a few loose bolts.
837 2018-12-04 22:44:49 If he got facial hair, then get him beard wash and oil.. that’s useful
838 2018-12-04 22:44:47 dunno why the UK is sourcing oil from other countries when it could just get it from my fucking face swear it’s oilier than the bloody Middle East
839 2018-12-04 22:44:47 chanukah is fun because you get to cook with oil, but i don't feel like cooking tonight, so I'll just order the oiliest and greasiest of all foods, a papa johns pizza
840 2018-12-04 22:44:40 Sorry, I’m not usually this slow...
Slice the acorn squash in half, seed them with a spoon and then slice in half again. Brush all sides with olive oil, place in a baking pan and sprinkle the top with salt and pepper and brown sugar. Bake at 400 for an hour.

841 2018-12-04 22:44:28 BO sure was in no hurry to get the Keystone pipeline finished.
He hired a tribe of American Indians to protest getting through Neb.
Plus--without a pipeline, who was hauling that shale oil?
His buddy Warren Buffet, a big dem contributor, & the main man at BNSF.
CHOO CHOO Charlie.
842 2018-12-04 22:44:24 Because way back when we built their oil infrastructure

847 2018-12-04 22:43:56 Try the oil filter, James Perrone had a Moroso on with no pressure then changed it and it came back
848 2018-12-04 22:43:33 Harmattan is baeeedry skin is its only problem. Use Shae butter and olive oil .
849 2018-12-04 22:43:19 You know I worked seismic exploration for four years and the oil rigs for one and I never once groped a reporter.
850 2018-12-04 22:43:18 my iced coffee tastes like motor oil
851 2018-12-04 22:43:12 @CTV_PowerPlay  We are 1.6 percent of the totla emmisions and the oil industry contributes  0.18 percent of the  that amount. We are not the problem. you need to preach to India, China, USA and third world countries to make any difference at all.
852 2018-12-04 22:43:05 Well, dear Kitty
1. I dont hide behind a clock tower
2. I didnt forget to remove the bot numbers after my name

853 2018-12-04 22:42:55 they waited until age 94 to "off" the old boy? One would think it would be wiser to kill him BEFORE he was a master pilot, armed forces expert, CIA chief, successful oil man, great president, one of the finest most charitable and kind men in the world. why not before this?
854 2018-12-04 22:42:47 Now lastly...  Mexico and the giant plate shifts.....God's gift.   35-30 years from now, there will be a GIANT new find of oil and gas that will run the length of the western continental shelf. As plates move, Heat and fissures release Carbon that molecularizes into hydrocarbons
855 2018-12-04 22:42:37 Interesting. I tried it like, 10 years ago and remember not liking it at all, but not because it was sweet. I didn’t like the flavor from the frying oil.
856 2018-12-04 22:42:34 Well I hope it had as little oil as possible, that helps when you’re ill 

...what? I couldn’t read that last bit
857 2018-12-04 22:42:30 This, but for vertigo. Have you tried CBD oil? I know of a couple of people with frequent migraines that say it helps a ton. I like it for anxiety but I can't speak to its migraine curing powers.
858 2018-12-04 22:42:30 You realize he lives near the largest oil reserves in the US, right? Everything is tied to oil. in Texas.
859 2018-12-04 22:42:27 How? Oil, coal, natural gas all came from dinosaurs and early plant life. He would raze all life forms and then what? Interesting topic for alternate history writers to contemplate.
860 2018-12-04 22:42:20 If it tasted like olive oil and looks like olive and functions like olive oil, I would be very surprised if it wasn’t olive oil! Consumable goods you can sample before buying aren’t like, say, a brand name bag which has qualities that affect performance.
861 2018-12-04 22:42:18 About ten years back I drove to Aberdeen and back in a day. Delivering a laptop to an oil company. Got two and a half days money for it, couldn't do it now though!
862 2018-12-04 22:42:10 History is already repeating itself... Oil marketers giving FG one week to pay 800 billion Naira subsidy... We're about 2 days past that countdown....
863 2018-12-04 22:42:10 @AJENews Qatar has to stop dealing with the west concerning oil and liquid gas and turn the signal towards Turkey,I think the poles of strength have to change.
864 2018-12-04 22:42:05 Man, acts of service is truly my love language 

1. Fill my tank with gas
2. Ubereat my lunch to work, so I can nap during break
3. Take my car for an oil change 
4. Pick up my son from school so I don’t have to sit in traffic for an hour

Lol, all the things I don’t wna to do 
865 2018-12-04 22:41:41 Betos avg donation was $200. My hubs worked as crane opr for oil co. We donated $50. My neighbor works at Murphy Oil Conv store she donated $10. We are oil&gas employees. Gimme a break. Bernie was in top 3 for $ from Healthcare & agribusiness.
866 2018-12-04 22:41:34 Did u ask him. About his involvement with $RIOT and the endless failed companies he was involved in. $BKD Delavaco Properties his Columbia oil and gas deal. Insider or not he is in the center. His next project #SEC
867 2018-12-04 22:41:33 A nice medium steak with baked brussel sprouts w/ olive oil and a bit of balsamic vinegar would be lovely right now.
868 2018-12-04 22:41:09 Attending anti oil protests and carrying stop tar sand signs is pretty extreme. 

She has evolved which is good.

While I have no time for bigots people evolve as evident by Notley. Kenny appears to have been a mixed bag 20 years ago but certainly not a bigot today. Intolerance
869 2018-12-04 22:41:05 Make sure ur steaks R at Room temp, season, cast iron skillet w olive oil and chopped garlic heated on high, sear all sides, place in oven until internal temp is 120-125, remove from oven and skillet, place a slice of butter on beef let rest for 7-10mins.  Serve
870 2018-12-04 22:40:55 At least they are not invading other countries for oil and other resources, killing so many innocent lives.

Perfect evening.
872 2018-12-04 22:40:43 Cbd oil with no thc has no medical value. If you don't believe me that's fine keep spending twice as much for meds you can get legally in a dispensary and get the right stuff. Cbd without thc is junk. I've been a consultant for 14 years. So good luck,  you'll need it.
873 2018-12-04 22:40:42 Because it's better for taxpayers in long run to control the means of production. Private industry exports profits to tax havens while pocketing subsidies and selling product. They exist to extract $, not oil.

879 2018-12-04 22:39:37 Why does no one care that theyre kilIing the earth. There are things you can do. Stop buying things with palm oil in. Stop supporting food big companies who dont care about what they trash. Go vegan. Reduce your plastic usage. So many things you can do. Why dont people care
880 2018-12-04 22:39:35 He's a DFER, and shill for oil and gas. Not at all what we need when faced with only twelve years to mitigate our climate crisis. He's also very patronizing to the grass roots activists here in CO that actually get shit done.
881 2018-12-04 22:39:25 Can't Pay oil maketers
Can't pay/ fund Universities

884 2018-12-04 22:39:15 Oil matters for HY. HY and IG do matter for how you think about equities, even if intraday correlations aren’t one for one. I don’t think the equity selloff is the reason for the credit widening.

889 2018-12-04 22:38:54 Here is another world follow up for you...the Alaska earthquakes...in a world of permafrost, underwater tables freeze, expanding. The whole of the Arctic is a giant sponge pulling oil with steam from the underground water tables. Prudoe Bay....reserves will actually grow.

895 2018-12-04 22:38:19 Is there some militarily strategic reason to maintain a relationship with Saudi Arabia? Can we do THAT without allowing them to screw us about oil and gas?
896 2018-12-04 22:38:14 Citizens united did not cause oil company to pressure their employees to give money to Beto.

900 2018-12-04 22:38:05 The daughter of an investing friend of mine told him she was going to take a chunk of money and buy pot stocks. We tried to talk her out of it on Sunday. July 2006 Aunts BF said he wanted to flip "RV Slabs" in Florida, July 2008 my uncle locked in heating oil $4. Top,Top,Top?
901 2018-12-04 22:38:04 For now. Even the Chinese who have built their economy on coal power are turning away from it. The trend away from coal, and eventually away from all petro chemicals is inexorable. Just look at the Canadian oil sands. Most of that oil will stay in the ground for lack of markets.
902 2018-12-04 22:37:59 For anyone who has a shar pei with a skin condition and can’t or are struggling to pay for steroids to keep it under control, COD liver oil tablets work a treat I’ve had mine on them for 2 weeks n no itching no biting n her fur & skin feel great also stops them from smelling!

905 2018-12-04 22:37:25 It’s scary when the oil pops…
906 2018-12-04 22:37:24 Price for husband to continue using the oil purchased through your clinic staggering!  He’s in chronic pain. Insurance companies must do something!!

909 2018-12-04 22:37:06 Costa Rica is 99% renewable.  The US could do it but there’s too much money invested in oil.  They don’t t want to lose their investments
910 2018-12-04 22:36:56 @ozclarke Just tried an Australian unoaked Chardonnay and the initial taste was of olives in oil, a new one for me, and rather lovely. Thanks for the Israel tips, they actually make some really good  full bodied reds down towards the Negev
911 2018-12-04 22:36:54 Well. You could have a Grandfather that earned a fortune with Irving oil and then a father that was once PM and then you get a trust fund and become PM and tell everyone else how to live
912 2018-12-04 22:36:52 I'm just assuming that Star readers would be content , after killing the oil sands, to then just power their cars with Saudi, Venezuelan, Nigerian, Iranian, Russian and Iraqi crude... All shipped up the St Lawrence by tanker.  Morons.
913 2018-12-04 22:36:50 The BBC have a real cheek to call RT a govt mouth piece where is the story of the HUGE oil n gas field being developed off Shetland... Give us back our oil money n fek off n we can stay in beautiful Europe...
914 2018-12-04 22:36:38 Stopped an idiot from siding into an oil tank by honking at her dumbass today  of course it had to be a woman looking a whole 9 years old driving
915 2018-12-04 22:36:36 Live dangerously, consider a drop or two of truffle oil.

You’re welcome 
916 2018-12-04 22:36:28 I don't actually recall "liking" that. But I do agree it's unfair to conflate donations from corporate pacs with individual donations from some guy who works at a gas station or a woman who works in an oil co. office. The first has direct policy implications. The second does not
917 2018-12-04 22:36:16 call for　～を呼び求める、必要とする

The recipe doesn't call for white truffle oil! What else you have…You are improvising!?
918 2018-12-04 22:36:02 Sautee them in oil, onion, garlic ..yum!
919 2018-12-04 22:35:59 I don’t see any evidence in this article that oil companies pressured employees to give their money to Beto. That’s the logical leap you made.
920 2018-12-04 22:35:58 @BTS_twt pls get Jimin a hot oil treatment and deep conditioning soon.. pls
921 2018-12-04 22:35:57 Roads. Buildings. Garbage. Pollution. Human waste. Oil spills.  Give me a break! I’ve seen what it looks like after you leave. And you have the balls to take credit for prairie chickens?! Only making noise at certain hours?! How about not doing ANY destruction! SMH!
922 2018-12-04 22:35:43 The oil/gas question isn’t so clear. But why is he sucking up to AIPAC?  (OK I know why, but it doesn’t make me want to vote for him).
923 2018-12-04 22:35:43 I think there are a lot of different world views and mediation is needed surely. Action is needed in some instances. Clean water vs oil in South Dakota. Clean water/ecosystems/waterways vs Mining & now Pipelines in Minnesota. Native peoples and environmentalists vs capitalists
924 2018-12-04 22:35:40 Oil and gas are important here but we're not stupid. Most of these companies are investing in renewables too. I donated to Beto!
925 2018-12-04 22:35:37 Depends on the mkt. I do think Corp credit and oil matter for equities
926 2018-12-04 22:35:36 Just over here trying to clean all the oil paint off the floor before Jarrett comes home, don't mind me

928 2018-12-04 22:35:20 Hi Patricia! I looked up your last visit with us and it looks like it was a straightforward oil change and tire rotation. Toyota Carlsbad does not use duct tape to fix vehicles. I'd like to investigate your visit please reach out! Vanessa Rodriguez Customer Relations 760/918-3795
929 2018-12-04 22:35:14 Duck fat is also good. And if oil is smoking or the latkes are burning, add a little grapeseed or avocado oil to up the smoke point.
930 2018-12-04 22:34:57 U realize it’s oil that is the cause 4 the reason. & the reason 4 Tillerson’s appointment 2 Sec. of State was 2 broker a deal 4 Russia oil. # want 2 bet that deal is still on the down low?
931 2018-12-04 22:34:56 Take a look Congress, you demand justice/sanctions on Saudi Arabia for the killing of one Saudi citizen. Trump doesn’t want to hinder our relations with them to keep oil prices down. Isn’t France protesting increase in oil prices???
932 2018-12-04 22:34:41 Certainly a chance to “stick it to Westminster” and to protect the rights of many Scottish workers. Particularly those in the NHS and the Oil and Gas industry.
933 2018-12-04 22:34:38 So.. I just finished paying off some car repairs that cost me $800.. I went for an oil change today to find out now I need MORE REPAIRS ON THIS FUCKING CAR... I’m paying more than what this car is worth.. I’m PISSED

936 2018-12-04 22:34:35 Yes, when YOU use bad republican spin from the 90's it's MY dismissal of that absurdity that is wrong.

I don't know anyone that is serious about climate change that puts oil executives as more important and is a loving, breathing, Democrat.
937 2018-12-04 22:34:29 Yes. Methane is the devil. It's evil incarnate because of animal sources. Methane produced in the oil & natural gas mining can't compare to sheep in green pastures. We can also ignore that it is short-lived compared to CO2 with a 70 year life to make sure we Go Vegan!

Pero creen que en MX van a ser bien portados.
939 2018-12-04 22:33:41 Particularly if there's a fad to avoid using oil as a feedstock. All that additional energy to conduct processing and transport heavier goods has to come from somewhere. How is our non-fossil freight network coming on anyway?

Good luck with your oil salesman job, tho.
941 2018-12-04 22:33:32 Don't forget our Federal gov't. And don't imagine we can't contribute our oil to mankind's and Canada's benefit. All we have to do is pull in the same direction, instead of the Feds saying one thing and doing another, trying to scuttle the energy industry.  Don't be a defeatist!

943 2018-12-04 22:33:22 And you mentioned the key. These are the only circumstances in which insurance should ever be used. The analogy you can think of is that we only use car insurance when there’s a wreck, because in a given year a single driver probably won’t have one. We dont use it for oil changes
944 2018-12-04 22:33:17 Oil lots and lots of oil

947 2018-12-04 22:33:05 I don’t know :( my son never had eczema and neither have I but I thought coconut oil worked wonders !

951 2018-12-04 22:32:35 nut based cheese can be good, but I like vegan food that doesn't pretend to be other previously-meaty/animal-based food best. like, pasta with simple dressing like lemon zest and olive oil and black pepper with well salted chick peas, for example, instead of cacio e pepe.
952 2018-12-04 22:32:32 Why should there be negotiation on wars for oil companies? You’re either for USA or your not. And if you’e not, pointless. I don’t don’t negotiate with terrorists.
953 2018-12-04 22:32:31 The Conservatives are 100% responsible for the failure of the oil fiasco in AB, both provincially & federally. The AB Cons stopped putting $ into AB’s heritage fund in the 80’s & the PCP put all their efforts into moving oil to the US. No lines to tidewater (forgot to consult).

983 2018-12-04 22:29:43 Exactly. It is not simply what we do in our own countries. It is what we force on the rest of the world to satisfy our consumer demands. Our demand for palm oil leads to mass clearing of forests which in turn lead to landslides & other crap outcomes for third world countries.

986 2018-12-04 22:29:21 @JennellesTwit My mother is going through dementia...how do you make the oil to put in brownies.
987 2018-12-04 22:29:19 smitten kitchen has some good ones. usually I do rice and legumes or roasted/steamed veg and rice with some very simple lemon juice and oil sauce with lots of black pepper and salt and herbs. I am allergic to nightshades so it eliminates a lot of vegan staples for flavor.
988 2018-12-04 22:29:18 Fellas! Man you gotta be careful wit the beard oil. That stuff ain't no joke!
989 2018-12-04 22:29:10 The reality in the REAL WORLD is that tariffs are in fact working. It's brought the Chinese to the table and there's been very little if no slow down in the American consumer, although I'd like to see the numbers after Christmas. Lower oil costs are certainly another net positive
990 2018-12-04 22:29:03 Aha it’s coffee with grass fed butter and MCT oil. It’s supposed to help create ketones and bc of the fat, the caffeine is absorbed slowly for a steady focus vs typical crash & burn. I def got the steady energy

1010 2018-12-04 22:26:43 Yes. But those don’t represent enough power to replace central station generating units for years to come. We learned how vulnerable we are during the 1974 Arab Oil Embargo. 44 years later, we have A few electric cars and some solar. We should be so much further along IMO.

1022 2018-12-04 22:25:28 @billbailey please note that compelling as the film may be the @Iceland position on Palm Oil isn't the full story.  We need Sustainable palm oil NOT no palm oil.  (Other oil crops use much more land).  See @chesterzoo for more info

1024 2018-12-04 22:25:24 Ask anyone does it make sense for America to produce oil to produce corn to produce fuel?  No, it is stupid but thousands of wonderful good people do it working for institutions.  It is one of the wicked problems of organizations as complex systems.
1025 2018-12-04 22:25:22 I do like olive oil and olive spread - and strangely mushroom soup is okay -  but having either in any other form, I'm not able to do... especially mushrooms; I'm the sort that'll pick them off a pizza!

1028 2018-12-04 22:25:15 LOL. I coated myself, my bed, my floor, my walls, like every surface of my room in peppermint oil.
1029 2018-12-04 22:24:59 I remember in 2010 Sarkozy tried to increase the pension age by two years and the whole of Marseille just shut down. they had fuel shortages across the country because they wouldn't dock oil tankers, and rubbish piled up in the city streets because the bin men went on strike.

1052 2018-12-04 22:22:37 The debate on climate change is great because it is not about left or right. But it is about old industries and profits which pay a lot of mortgages that will fight for their survival mostly oil and coal. They have a lot of power and money.

1073 2018-12-04 22:21:17 Fact: Men are more willing and able to work in harsh work conditions such as oil rigs, construction, and firefighting.
1074 2018-12-04 22:21:17 Trump sucking up to #MBS as if there is no one else in Saudi Arabia who would sell us oil, buy our stuff, and maybe kill less people if they were in charge #KhashoggiMurder

1077 2018-12-04 22:21:01 De teerzanden zijn een grote energie wissel. Gas -> Oil. Als het  prijsverschil groot genoeg is wordt er geproduceerd. Een gedeelte van  mijn onderzoek, en de huidige focus van mijn collega's in Canada, was te  kijken naar andere vormen van warmte (kern bv.) ipv gas.
1078 2018-12-04 22:21:00 The feds should have ponied up for a refinery the second the BC numpties kicked off about Trans Mountain. Refine crude here, then pump value-added gas through pipelines to feed the desire for cheap gas in end markets. Better than paying Texans to refine our oil for us.
1079 2018-12-04 22:20:55 I posted it near $300 oil/b forecast
1080 2018-12-04 22:20:52 I work in the oil industry. I am a Democrat through and through. I want my industry regulated. He’s from Texas. Of course a lot of oil and gas people support him. Individual contributions, those limited by $ amount do not influence anyone.
1081 2018-12-04 22:20:44 Got to love the responses on here, is NS supposed ingnore NS oil & Gas and shut it all down and throw everyone on the dole, just to keep everyone happy about   the environment, Scotland  can only try our best as our FM is only securing people's jobs, after all this her job.
1082 2018-12-04 22:20:44 Homemade Parmesan/Garlic/Oregano/Salt/Pepper potato wedges. Toss them in oil then the dry ingredients, 40 minutes in the oven at 425F, and done. Had mine with some ketchup and mayo. Fuggin'stuffed!!
1083 2018-12-04 22:20:40 Just read it. Well, it's not new. The Talmudic sages didn't think much of the Hasmonean dynasty so they played down the Maccabean/Hasmonean guerilla fighters & emphasized the oil miracle: Tractate Shabbat. Re Chanukah & Xmas: syncretism isn't hypocrisy. Enjoy both if you can.
1084 2018-12-04 22:20:40 So true! Sometimes, it is hard to make something fresh. We have an Earth Fare with a well-stocked hot bar, lots of vegetables prepared in olive oil. Also, an organic salad bar. It’s ao convenient when we’re pressed for time!
1085 2018-12-04 22:20:32 I thought the oil had run out? 

Anyway, it’s worthless.*

1091 2018-12-04 22:19:49 Not much evidnce of the EU failing. In the biggest recession since the 1930's it largely held together. The oil price is down since 2014. The EU is heading for #1. See big picute not a 1000 UKIP cherries.
1092 2018-12-04 22:19:46 I may have not turned anyone vegan but I just converted a girl into buying natural plastic free cruelty free palm oil free vegan shampoo bars instead of commercial soooo 
1093 2018-12-04 22:19:41 Do you have any reputable research showing climate change is made up? Because there's piles of verifiable, legit science showing it's real. But hey keep believing those who deny it and also conveniently profit off the continued use of oil.
1094 2018-12-04 22:19:41 I did no such thing, considering Beto DID. NOT. TAKE. MONEY. FROM. OIL. COMPANIES.
1095 2018-12-04 22:19:39 It has nothing to do with terrorism. It has everything to do with authoritarianism and the billion or so people soon made climate refugees by big oil and coal, the lifeblood of right-wing, authoritarian political donations.

1099 2018-12-04 22:19:12 I get the Korean war reference. I don't recall any peace treaty being signed.

And oil exporting isn't the same as energy independence. As I understand it, we still import a ton of oil. Seems a little dishonest to claim we should thank Trump for our "energy independence", no?
1100 2018-12-04 22:19:08 Because individuals in Texas, of which the oil and gas industry is a large employer, donated to his campaign. He didn’t take any corporate cash and you know it. You’re just being misleading and shame on you.
1101 2018-12-04 22:19:07 Breast milk! Fresh & warm works best. If you can't get any, then boil clove of fresh garlic in olive oil & let cool off a bit. Dip cotton ball in it & while on your side drip it into your ear, stay like that for 5 min, then switch sides. Keep some bread handy for optional snack.

1115 2018-12-04 22:18:08 So you admit you can’t answer that simple question. The answer is never. After the 1100’s the Middle East was never peaceful. Considering they have most of the worlds oil doesn’t it seem logical the developed world would have a vested interest in the Middle East?

1119 2018-12-04 22:17:42 Gaddafi had plans to stop trading oil for USD too...
1120 2018-12-04 22:17:39 Macron of France by executive order suspends the fuel hikes because France is burning. I thought oil prices are a fixed thing that economies have no control over. Clearly these intl, prices are not as fixed after all, because a president can suspend them by executive order.
1121 2018-12-04 22:17:24 Compared to Trump He looks great. It is relative. Oil and gas are going to continue to decline. Energy markets have always been volatile. Now Saudis and us want to bankrupt Iran and one of the best ways is to glut the market in a downturn.
1122 2018-12-04 22:17:23 I'm getting a deal on my oil change this month; it's Pumpkin Spice.
1123 2018-12-04 22:17:18 ...and give billions of government welfare to oil, gas, and "beautiful, clean [sic]" coal.
1124 2018-12-04 22:17:18 I’ve never made my own arancini! But I have deep fried many things so what could possibly go wrong. Double dip is the only thing I can suggest? (Ie. Flour->milk/egg->breadcrumbs->repeat->fry) an make sure oil is mega hot then turn it down to medium
1125 2018-12-04 22:17:16 Yes, human beings who work in the O&G sector shouldn't be allowed to individually donate to political candidates they like. They should be barred from existing.

Oil and Gas industry accounts for 9% of Texas' GDP. It's quite obvious that he underperformed in the sector massively.
1126 2018-12-04 22:17:13 Snake oil sales man, or carnival barker
1127 2018-12-04 22:17:08 How? By sitting on her hands for 3.5 years doing nothing but harm the oil and gas industry and now when she realizes that she has zero chance for a victory in 2019 she is "standing up" for the oil sector in a hope to get votes in May?
1128 2018-12-04 22:17:06 lrt making personal changes never hurts too... ive stopped eating pork, dont use/buy straws anymore (the bar i work at doesnt offer them anymore too!), check everything i buy for palm oil, etc
1129 2018-12-04 22:17:05 @WhiteHouse This Is Economics Progress For The Oil Industries. See.
1130 2018-12-04 22:17:00 if one more shop tells me they can’t do a fucking oil change on my car i will lose it. i literally just need this bitch to get more oil!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OR SHELL DIEEEEEEEEE
1131 2018-12-04 22:16:53 Madam Lauretta please be informed that Conscience is an open wound only the truth can heal it. Stop the lies and face reality. You can only tell a blind man that there's no oil in the soup but for salt his tongue will.
1132 2018-12-04 22:16:52 What is it with stolen money n corrupt money to you buharrist! Why those this mssg resonates with you guys. And why do you think is only Buhari that can get the money back, money from oil proceeds.
1133 2018-12-04 22:16:50 Okay that's a different discussion but you jumped on here to defend Beto's taking of oil companies money, it had nothing to do about voting records or guns, twisting the conversation just a little bit aren't you?
1134 2018-12-04 22:16:44 パンさんこっちでもおはごです～！！
1135 2018-12-04 22:16:34 1) In what world are there only two companies? A meaningless vacuum scenario.
2) Generally they just cooperate and gouge the populace because they'll both make more (see: the oil industry)
3) They will never cut their prices to the point where they do not generate profit.
1136 2018-12-04 22:16:30 @WhiteHouse Grow And Grow More And More. The World Economies Need For Oil Increases With Time. More Demand. Higher Prices. A Good Thing.
1137 2018-12-04 22:16:25 No candidate can take corporate donations. So if you criticize Republicans for taking oil money, you should do the same for Democrats. Fidelity to principle is more important than fidelity to party.
1138 2018-12-04 22:16:16 Somewhat like armies really. Often over a few miles of land or a bit of oil.

1161 2018-12-04 22:14:07 All about those that depend on oil revenues.
1162 2018-12-04 22:13:53 Have you ever wondered why America is not further ahead with fossil-free energy?  Could it be that a lot of the rich are making very good money with oil, coal, etc.,  and do not care if it pollutes the atmosphere for they rest of us?
1163 2018-12-04 22:13:53 Texas it's A HUGE oil and gas state. It should surprise no one that large cash contributions would come from people involved in that industry, nor should it matter
1164 2018-12-04 22:13:40 Yeah I know. Mainly Le Pen voters who don't give a crap about climate change and depleted oil supply like their orange American idol on the other side of the Atlantic. We have the same problem with idiot Brexit supporters who want to self harm the UK & our relationship with EU.
1165 2018-12-04 22:13:37 Great fuckin waY to vent Rati  better luck next go round  I need a new oil cartridge

1172 2018-12-04 22:12:48 @WhiteHouse High Oil Prices Mean More Money In The World Economies. See. A Good Thing.
1173 2018-12-04 22:12:42 Try using Shea butter you can buy it from Cosmetics 
Try MPL  you can buy it from pep
Try Coconut oil from pick'n pay
Try dermasul hair  food from Pep store
1174 2018-12-04 22:12:32 Sirota assumed that those of us reading his tweet would be as ignorant as those at a Trump rally. We aren't. Selective, out of context charts are not proof of anything except that Big oil & Big gas are largest employers in Tx. That we already knew.
1175 2018-12-04 22:12:26 Just hammer him on the gender study’s done for imported Saudi oil because he can’t weasel out of that.
1176 2018-12-04 22:12:21 Many executives, you mean? If you're suggesting that the "many single donors" were small-dollar donations from the 99%, a citation is need.

Has Beto signed onto the #GreenNewDeal yet? If he's uninfluenced by Big Oil, there shouldn't be any barriers to supporting this policy.
1177 2018-12-04 22:12:20 lol certainly not any filthy rich ass politicians with pockets full of oil and blood money like beto or bernie

like sure i voted for both of them but you won't catch me wasting my time speaking up for either of them

France imports sugarcane from Nigeria, and exports sugarcubes to them mostly in the form of St Louis Sugar. Switzerland imports cocoa from Cote d'Ivoire & Ghana, & exports chocolate to them.

1187 2018-12-04 22:11:50 @WhiteHouse High Oil Prices Are Good. There Is Other Industries Too. That Feed Off The Oil Industries.
1188 2018-12-04 22:11:49 You had better not go if a major portion of this is not on oil crisis and if action plans are not done seriously.
1189 2018-12-04 22:11:44 I disagree that the NDP are anti-energy. Notley has fought damn hard for pipelines and now rail. I do believe (like I do), that Alberta needs to move forward with developing renewables technologies and value-added products to counter the decline in oil and gas investment.
1190 2018-12-04 22:11:36 Senator Graham do the right thing.. a human life is not an oil deal.. Stand for Americans!

1196 2018-12-04 22:11:12 It can’t be filtered though then that would make the oil contaminated. The amount of people bringing up the issues of allergies alone let alone religious reasons for not wanting to eat certain foods. They’re not going be allowed to operate if there’s contaminated oil.
1197 2018-12-04 22:11:08 That was such a French response, Paris is the East Lansing of Europe in that regard. Wake me when the gov’t is taking people’s homes for highway construction. What nobody can afford long term is permanently wedding prosperity to cheap oil.
1198 2018-12-04 22:10:50 Would be smarter to tax the big oil corporations and other big polluter industries, while incentivizing smaller industries and individual citizens to make better choices. Rebates on electric and hybrid vehicles, energy efficient homes, etc. Invest taxes in renuables and training

1200 2018-12-04 22:10:47 Trudeau is my prime minister and I can barely hold my lunch down saying that. Your economy is doing much better with trump than ours is with trudeau. He encouraged our oil to sit and not be sold while importing oil. Then bailed out a dying GM just for it to die.

1206 2018-12-04 22:10:02 ブレーキランプ5回点滅、ごま油のサイン。
1207 2018-12-04 22:09:52 não resolve nada!! gastei dinheiro a toa. o bio oil é ótimo, porém carinho (o do aliexpress é tipo 3 dolares)
1208 2018-12-04 22:09:50 Examples of scarce resources: water, oil, food, land, shelter, clothing, cell phones, vehicles, and most importantly, human beings.
1209 2018-12-04 22:09:30 Yeah especially because it’s all because of their oil money
1210 2018-12-04 22:09:30 You think you have written a book about oil makes you understand how much we’re with? 
Even most of your points in the book are wrong.
1211 2018-12-04 22:09:08 Orange , Order , oil , open
1212 2018-12-04 22:09:08 The demand for oil and gas is rising. Always has. And will continue to rise until at least 2050.  That’s a pretty basic fact.
1213 2018-12-04 22:09:06 Yeah yeah I get you. But youre not understanding my point, if it’s filtered in the same oil which is what’s being said. Then the fish oil is mixing with the other oils despite being cooked differently.
1214 2018-12-04 22:09:06 Why do I wait an hour for an oil change when they take much less time? #fallingasleepoverhere 
1215 2018-12-04 22:09:04 It will tank further when they lose the oil
1216 2018-12-04 22:08:52 okay but he's talking about straight up drinking lots of olive oil in hot chocolate Julia and I think we can agree that's a very different thing.
1217 2018-12-04 22:08:51 I want an iPhone that runs on whale oil
1218 2018-12-04 22:08:44 haaaa no not those kind of orbs.. the ones you see at nuclear power plants, oil derricks etc.. these are made in the usa surveillance recon orbs
1219 2018-12-04 22:08:28 He is in their pocket . If you paid attention in the previous 8 years the leader positioned us to be less energy dependent on Saudi oil. Smarten up
1220 2018-12-04 22:08:23 I have seen several interesting recipes for olive oil chocolate cakes - apparently really good as a moistening agent?????
1221 2018-12-04 22:08:15 Hey Rob, wondering if you’ll ever see Mediterranean fracking oil control away from Iran  and Russia for the petrol dollar as the main reason the west can’t give autonomy to Palestinians. But I say shower the world with micro grid circular economy and watch peace  on 
1222 2018-12-04 22:08:15 It's your boy,    oil
1223 2018-12-04 22:08:14 Carnival Barker or snake oil salesman.
1224 2018-12-04 22:07:53 ‘purity left’ - climate change is real and supposed democrats concerned about that issue shouldn’t take money from that industry (notably multiple oil/gas executives)
1225 2018-12-04 22:07:52 Natripan namin ni winie na magpa hot oil mamaya HAHAHAHA
1226 2018-12-04 22:07:42 Yeah well if you are into SENS and calorie restriction, you’ve got green leafy vegetables as the main food source with limited fat (olive oil), some starch from vegetables and thats it. A whole 1200-1400 calories a day

1232 2018-12-04 22:07:08 And Coco oil
1233 2018-12-04 22:06:48 I love oil and gas as a chemistry student but; how will it survive? 
Use was way lower than expected. Why do you think the barrel dropped so low? To much production and not enough demand. Why is demand down? My generation.
1234 2018-12-04 22:06:48 Just put it in the bottom of the pan then pour the corn in. Just need enough to coat the bottom of the pan. As the oil is heating keep moving the pan around so the kernels get covered
1235 2018-12-04 22:06:44 I am disciplining myself to not eat out but once a week... spending max $20 when I do, Damn, that's $80 a month... (My oil change, right there), YEP me cooking lol
1236 2018-12-04 22:06:41 My baby needs an oil change, wheel alignment & a car wash. I know she mad at me 
1237 2018-12-04 22:06:39 Back to Leonard Ravenhill ..some Holy Oil a night at Galilee ... Im certain Ill Walk on Water first before I have the Miracle of Marriage.

1240 2018-12-04 22:06:28 Hey, @GM.

Sue the sh*t out of @realDonaldTrump.

People want electric cars.

You are not beholden to the oil, gas, and petroleum industry.

Make electric vehicles, and change the world for the better.

Take this 3rd path, and run with it.

#ElectricVehicles
1241 2018-12-04 22:06:26 And you never answered how getting a D- from the NRA is equal to the same thing as a person getting the SECOND most money from oil.
1242 2018-12-04 22:06:23 I did a bit of a Churchill-esque quote in a work thing today and I was quite pleased with it, so you lot are getting it now: 'We shall stand behind the rocks onto which we think their ship is heading, but we will not deliberately blow out the oil lamp in the light house'
1243 2018-12-04 22:06:21 Nope my oil can just be dirty forever 
1244 2018-12-04 22:06:16 He gets the second most money in Congress from oil lobby
1245 2018-12-04 22:06:11 Well if you balancing the books you haven’t got the money to buy the league. Shouldn’t be a Russian billionaire or a Middle Eastern oil baron just pumping endless money in, league will end up shit like the french league
1246 2018-12-04 22:06:11 I see stuff from companies that test on animals, use palm oil in their products & do other weird stuff in the newsfeed just because they pay for it, I usually block those accounts...
1247 2018-12-04 22:06:04 I'm not a Dr., you are! It's not my job to know shit and save lives, it's yours. Namecalling and insults instead of looking up APOPTOSIS or Googling Cannabis Oil Extract bottles from 1850. I'm not a Scientist but am a survivor while my so called Dr watched me go to 80lbs at 5'7.
1248 2018-12-04 22:06:01 .@RTE_PrimeTime It's not the oil riches from Norway that have funded the very generous subsidies & incentives for evs the revenue has been generated by heavily taxing the most polluting cars so it is entirely self-funding & not dependent on any other resources or budgets #rtept

1250 2018-12-04 22:05:36 It’s Scotland’s oil...give 100% to Scotland 
1251 2018-12-04 22:05:28 بناتك ? طيب الحمد لله فيه امل 
1252 2018-12-04 22:05:26 Whatever you do, don't talk about the labor orgs and ENGOs in the Carbon Capture Coalition which was created from the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative. While you're at it don't talk about the bipartisan efforts to expand #45Q tax credits for #CCUS #GreenNewDeal
1253 2018-12-04 22:05:24 Mind warp? Pffft. Snake oil technology! All you had to do was just ask her. She probably was already in the mood…
1254 2018-12-04 22:05:24 But over 40% of our oil comes from Canada and only 11% comes from Saudi Arabia then Mexico .... so why are we treating our neighbors to the north like shit and sucking up to a psychopath ?
1255 2018-12-04 22:05:21 coconut oil & butter in coffee is a thing. your kid is ahead of the health revolution curve.
1256 2018-12-04 22:05:20 #SensationalWIP 5:

Ti prefers night-time: starlight, moonlight, cooking fires, fireflies, oil lamps. For him, daylight blasts away the subtleties of soft things.

Sasuri's most at home in or near the ocean, and loves the bright lancing shafts of refracted sunlight through water.
1257 2018-12-04 22:05:06 Yeah. The wind-whip essentially makes my eyes dart around faster than a crumb in boiling oil. Autism fun times.
1258 2018-12-04 22:04:39 No, I meant I need to start making ramen I burned myself with the oil from cooking chicken
1259 2018-12-04 22:04:29 まだ考査までちょっとだけ期間があるので頑張って勉強します！ありがとうございます！
1260 2018-12-04 22:04:26 pretty sick of people abusing the word "wellness" to try and upsell their cheap shitty essential oil MLM schemes on to the uneducated and unexpecting.  fucking WELLNESS my asshole
1261 2018-12-04 22:04:19 Heh. I can't do everything but I do have a sample bottle of Luna oil that doesn't seem to be doing me much good. Do you want it?
1262 2018-12-04 22:04:15 thanks, Pablo. they said it overheated, coolant mixed with the oil and head gasket blew out. it’s at 59K miles, if that helps
1263 2018-12-04 22:04:04 Filled a juul pod up wit oil cuz I can’t dab at work #imamadScientist
1264 2018-12-04 22:03:48 Put engine oil and start it again 
1265 2018-12-04 22:03:39 I’m going to take a wild guess, based on the puzzling fact that during a visit to Moscow on 7/6/2016,  Carter Page « and associates » were offered brokerage of a 19% stake in Russia’s state oil company in exchange for the lifting of US sanctions on Russia.
1266 2018-12-04 22:03:37 I try very hard to accommodate my kids' harmless idiosyncrasies, especially when they're home sick from school, but 4yo asking for "lots of olive oil" in his hot chocolate is just a shade more lateral thinking than I can bear.
1267 2018-12-04 22:03:35 Look back to successful GOP leaders: Romney, McCain, Bush 1-2, and more. Compassionate conservatives who had heart, and soul. No one pays attention to the “snake oil salesman,” or a “False Prophet.” Real leaders like Christ always put the needs of others first.
1268 2018-12-04 22:03:32 1/3 of Canada's natural gas is used up in the production of oil sands.
1269 2018-12-04 22:03:30 Damn without him who knows when that oil would have gotten changed ! #notallheroeswearcapes
1270 2018-12-04 22:03:26 I actually need some tea tree oil so that'd be grand

I'll try to think of something better than Snowfield once I get over bashing my knee
1271 2018-12-04 22:03:23 a guy I fancied told me he did pole dancing n I go “aw do you oil up your hands before?” Aye gage because that’s gona fuckin help them grip onto the pole u prick
1272 2018-12-04 22:03:22 If this is how you see Saudi Arabia; then your completely wrong. Take action against Saudi and see your entire economy crumble. 
Imagine all GCC states start selling oil in Yen? Hmm 
Pull all investments? Give it to China and Russia? Lose alliance in ME? 
Your grasp is limited
1273 2018-12-04 22:03:15 I have very few cooking secrets but this is one of them: For the best latkes you've ever had, put a tablespoon of schmaltz in the cooking oil.
1274 2018-12-04 22:03:14 THat is nothing but bullshit.
They even can't manage this country with oil money
1275 2018-12-04 22:03:11 Yes, famously unregulated markets like oil, steel, intellectual property, and telecom
1276 2018-12-04 22:03:09 Oil is so non consensus right here even though the chart is a beauty. May add more here after hours
1277 2018-12-04 22:03:08 Does that include ALL subsidies?  Including Oil, gas, and farm subsidies?
I bet it doesn't.
1278 2018-12-04 22:03:07 Sounds good. Do you just coat the corn in chilli oil before you cook it?
1279 2018-12-04 22:02:57 Moothramozhichappol closetil manju Veena pole velutha niram.hmm...oil change cheyyaanaayittund.
1280 2018-12-04 22:02:54 Umm the CEOs of the big corporations maxed out to him... And he supports exporting oil and more production. Natural gas would just delay the needed shift and use up money that needs to go towards renewables.
1281 2018-12-04 22:02:47 For OIL that has already leaked into the drinking water that supplies millions of people. If you ever have time to watch the videos of these oil giants lying about the pipelines being safe you’d get a good laugh. Or even trumps video of him saying
1282 2018-12-04 22:02:46 In the quote - it sounds like pigs are fed soy beans rather than meal, a by product of biofuel production itself, but also in many other sources - palm is more prominent than soy oil the wider conversation
1283 2018-12-04 22:02:45 Probably has more to do with the Military's sonic testing or "private" business sonic testing for oil and minerals.
Everything is Sound and Light.  Health and healing is balance or "ease", the opposite is "dis-ease".
Why this is such a difficult reach medically is the question.
1284 2018-12-04 22:02:44 Snake oil always follows promising people and ideas. Like clockwork.
1285 2018-12-04 22:02:44 Oil
1286 2018-12-04 22:02:38 This is the fate that America avoided by electing @realDonaldTrump. 

Rob you slob Socialism doesn’t work. 
Globalism doesn’t work. 

Hiking the price of oil in an already-depressed economy in the name of “saving the environment” does not work. 

Trump works.
1287 2018-12-04 22:02:36 The dog was barking like mad in the bedroom  where he strangled his wife....this was a hell of a case...killed his kids put them in oil tanks..killed his wife and unborn child..and buried her......he was a narkpsycho!!fidgety just like McCann but he confessed...the house was huge
1288 2018-12-04 22:02:33 SHAME on the Farm subsidies  $22 Billion in handouts
SHAME on the Oil Co's a $40 Billion stigma
SHAME on Ethanol   $20 Billion
SHAME on Housing  $15 Billion
SHAME on Dairy   $20 Billion
SHAME on Beef   $38 Billion
SHAME on Pork   $20 Billion

How do they live with the SHAME 
1289 2018-12-04 22:02:31 Caution: butter is the gateway drug that inevitably leads to a truffle oil addiction.
1290 2018-12-04 22:02:28 The reason a lot of stuff is cheaper from China is that they don’t have the environmental protection laws we do...stuff just gets dumped into a river or recycled...like leather oil getting packaged as cooking oil and sold to restaurants.
1291 2018-12-04 22:02:26 There should never have been a relationship with SA, a highly oppressive & destabilizing regime. The relationship exists solely for the greed of the small number of oil potentates. US & average American benefit not at all
1292 2018-12-04 22:02:25 He's referring to the War between N and S Korea. 
And the US is the world's largest oil exporter. Or right up there and and climbing, I dont have the exact numbers on me. But Trump has certainly pushed us further in that direction, opening federal land up unlike Obama.
1293 2018-12-04 22:02:21 So, the rise in oil prices 'at the end of their tenure' somehow contrived to fuel growth in the years leading up to that end? What a magical mysterious piece of work!
1294 2018-12-04 22:02:09 Getting an oil change – bij Best Buy
1295 2018-12-04 22:02:07 Aku tetap setia dengan baby oil :”)
1296 2018-12-04 22:02:03 Awesome.  Add it to suing big oil and Trump, bike lanes, straws and everything else no one cares that you celebrate about.  Stop joining the mayor and the rest of the council in ignoring the real issues
1297 2018-12-04 22:02:02 I just bought a shit ton of Carhartt shit. I look like I work in the oil fields in the middle of Alaska
1298 2018-12-04 22:01:59 The coup plotters have been treating the Oil money as loot and have corrupted their friends and kinsmen to keep the looting ongoing. If the Oil was in the north, they would do better than they have done today and a penny of the money won't get to the south.

1308 2018-12-04 22:01:07 Ohhh I know. Not only that, but I can imagine the perks and “contributions” flowing from the oil companies to “our representatives” - a number who also work for the oil companies, can’t have helped the situation when it came to things like tax credits. CBC never really went away
1309 2018-12-04 22:01:07 косата ми мирише страхотно благодарение на ~~moroccan oil colour complete~~
1310 2018-12-04 22:01:03 -799.36 looks like Wall St. is realizing you are a snake oil salesman. Tell us your snake story again, I didn’t realize it was autobiographical.
1311 2018-12-04 22:00:59 Oil? maybe?  That the  Saudi Prince is a MURDERER is not just a reasonable suspicion; it's a fact, and now Trump and this Administration is conspiring with them for profits. Maybe the shared economy isn't best served by CRIMINALS.
1312 2018-12-04 22:00:57 Oh Notley you're the only person who does not want to admit today the abundance of oil around the world etc.the big companies of vehicles build electric cars,so oil prices never going up?Always down? So time to look for manufacturing to keep our economy  running without problems
1313 2018-12-04 22:00:37 December 04, 2018 at 05:00PM Time for #AmazonWatch to stop covering up Petroecuador's oil spills.

1318 2018-12-04 22:00:15 not even going to try to figure out this beto o'rourke oil thing. my brain is already dying
1319 2018-12-04 22:00:10 I’ll pay you for your services?! I have and end of some brown parcel tape, some tea tree oil in a bottle (half FULL! Ish) and a drawing pin. You may have one.
1320 2018-12-04 22:00:07 Got an oil change, fixed my tire, and got a car wash. I’m doing good
1321 2018-12-04 22:00:06 “Zinke and his political staff have consistently sidelined scientists and experts while handing the agency’s keys over to oil, gas and mining interests. The only saving grace is that Zinke and his colleagues are not very good at it”

Garbage admin led by a garbage president
1322 2018-12-04 21:59:59 Refer to screenshot from a McDonald’s worker pls! The fish and the other meat is the same oil, veg is diff.
1323 2018-12-04 21:59:56 AB is one of the most diverse enconmies in Canada. And the west is the MOST diverse economy in Canada. Beef, forestry, agriculture, oil/gas, tourism all that and the rocky mountains
1324 2018-12-04 21:59:51 Canada does not import Saudi oil, Irving does. You are suggesting Canada make a private company’s purchasing decisions. Also where Irving purchases from makes zero difference to oil prices for Canada.
1325 2018-12-04 21:59:28 O'Rourke also hides (like others) his corporate donations behind the "small" label with bundling. A lot of "individual small contributors" from Oil and Gas industries!
1326 2018-12-04 21:59:26 Why don't you and your followers just leave these shores? Then the rest of us can get back to normality and build on the strengths that we have within the E.U. Carpet baggers, snake oil merchants and disaster capitalists can then sail off into the sunset looking for Atlantis.
1327 2018-12-04 21:59:09 The Paris agreement still allows developing Nations like Nigeria some allowance, to allow for socioeconomic development but with the long term goal in mind. They will however have to conduct certain activities in an eco-friendlier pattern. i.e No gas flaring, No oil spillage etc
1328 2018-12-04 21:59:07 I just wanted to correct the statement that renewables are the solution to ME oil dependency, when its not. then i found myself defending myself as a climate denier, when I'm not, and a Saudi supporter, which Im not.
1329 2018-12-04 21:59:05 exactly. Was oil/gas/coal as vocal as Xcel in opposing renewables at the, heh, turn of the century? My recollection is not.
1330 2018-12-04 21:58:57 Here you go again Pete
More tin foil hat lies.
If Trump & the @GOP are “Putin’s puppets”, why would Trump tell the EU to STOP buying so much oil/gas from Russia, and WHY would  build a naval base in Ochakov, which infuriated Putin?
Everything you write is #FAKENEWS
1331 2018-12-04 21:58:47 Standard oil, union banking. Some of them like Ford were anti Semitic but were definately profit driven and helped the Nazis. But go ahead and just blame FDR

1333 2018-12-04 21:58:19 something I've learned from my roommate working as an oil tech on cars: 

• those "bad" reviews saying "weehhh they refused to change my oil!! They're MEAN!!!!!" are either A) bc they don't have the proper equipment to do so for certain car models or B) bc u were a huge asshole
1334 2018-12-04 21:58:15 You may wanna "start fresh" and try to get a good solid patina first by doing a few rounds of baking it with oil
1335 2018-12-04 21:58:13 recently found out u not supposed to put oil in the water when u making pasta cause it prevents the sauce from sticking to the noodles
1336 2018-12-04 21:57:53 Or a fresh spinach salad with tomato or berries! Or roast the potatoes with olive oil,  onions,  carrots or sweet potatoes! Hearty, healthy and delicious!
1337 2018-12-04 21:57:43 No good if cooked in vegetable oil, though. Look in the kitchen to see if they're using butter or Canola!
1338 2018-12-04 21:57:39 Distributor drive shaft broke? Oil pump pickup tube loose or off?
1339 2018-12-04 21:57:28 Season it before you use it - use a very light coating of a neutral oil (canola) and put it in a 300 degree oven for an hour. NEVER use dish soap.
1340 2018-12-04 21:57:25 Use it to buy 6kogo of garri 900, and buy 2 kogo of beans which is 1400 and use the remaining 700 to buy groundnut oil and red oil with salt
1341 2018-12-04 21:57:20 Oil money makes it possible. And you lot keep praising this shitshow lol
1342 2018-12-04 21:57:09 Is it good to give a Christmas tree tea tree oil, or is it cannabilism?
1343 2018-12-04 21:57:07 @jeffkilburg @jimiuorio can u explain what u mean by all.crude oil bull bets are off if spx500 breaks below 2700?
1344 2018-12-04 21:57:06 Plus not sure who is saying that petrloeum prices internationally are going down, so insane. Except in August, in both sept and oct prices have gone up by 3 and 5 percents. Pml n was so lucky that oil prices remained 44 on average for 2015 till 2017 but still they wasted it
1345 2018-12-04 21:57:00 awaiting this synthetic oil change to be complete,
1346 2018-12-04 21:56:56 There are billions & billions of cars and gas powered engines & you think they are all just going to disappear lol.
China is building coal plants at a record pace and the tourism industry is a fraction of oil and gas.
But if we don't act now our polar caps will be melted by 2013.
1347 2018-12-04 21:56:52 I am left with absolutely no other choice but to conjure the event from memory and render it as a full scale oil painting. Thanks, “Disney”

oil painting
1353 2018-12-04 21:56:29 Oil's down 35% in 2 mos.Inflation has peaked for the cycle.Housing & auto cycles rolling over as is the global economy.Yet Powell still thinks the economy is strong & that he needs to continue to tighten.Fed never seems to learn from previous cycles.Leverage will exacerbate error
1354 2018-12-04 21:56:22 How rock the boat.if we are so concerned about climate change here is a fact.what is the main cause of it.simple fossil fuel.i don't see any of switching off the taps at the oil rigs.the pollute the atmosphere and we destroy the sea' s with th plastics we dump made from oil
1355 2018-12-04 21:56:15 This is the fate that America avoided by electing @realDonaldTrump. 

Socialism doesn’t work. 
Globalism doesn’t work. 

Hiking the price of oil in an already-depressed economy in the name of “saving the environment” does not work. 

Trump works.

1361 2018-12-04 21:55:34 i had the gracious oppurtunity to ask “any tall girls wanna help me” in oil class today
1362 2018-12-04 21:55:30 Dave's product is himself , he scammed YouTube with spam videos and rode the wave of the wild West of the internet , now the West is tamed and Phil's product is snake oil
1363 2018-12-04 21:55:27 Units are out on Prestige Park for a fuel oil spill.  Department of Energy and Environmental Protection requested to the scene.  Please avoid the area if possible.
1364 2018-12-04 21:55:00 I have oily skin and I been breaking out. The oil is out of control 
1365 2018-12-04 21:54:53 It's absolutely a good comparison. Oil kills and he should be fighting the industry tooth and nail. He shouldn't be accepting a single cent from people within the industry if he wants to be taken seriously. No compromise.

1368 2018-12-04 21:54:29 Would disagree at all ... I’m not sure the global producers of oil will let that happen for a while yet I fear 
1369 2018-12-04 21:54:24 In presidential campaigns, big bundlers can bring in $5 million each. If I bundle that from my oil friends, I want a return on my investment.
1370 2018-12-04 21:54:23 If I one more thing about fish oil I am so gonna blow so much fire out of my mouth I'll burn Dallas Texas to the ground
1371 2018-12-04 21:54:21 Think the government may turn the tires into oil but good use of your creative juices @DAlexForce
1372 2018-12-04 21:54:04 i will actually send you his @ if you want but i think if someone who claims to own oil companies all over the US and europe wants an itunes gift card they’d just buy it themselves :(
1373 2018-12-04 21:53:55 ohhhhh baby its cold outside.... WELL we can sort that for you all it will cost is a fiver. That is the price of a book of tickets for our annual Christmas draw with first prize 500 ltrs of home heating oil! Tickets available now 
1374 2018-12-04 21:53:45 Keep your lamp full of oil, and have extra.
 The lamp of the body is the eye, keep the eyes trained on the truth.  The truth is Jesus, Justus,  and the Lord God.
 God bless you and whatever your going through just look at my life this should inspire you. He who knows the truth =

1378 2018-12-04 21:53:28 There’s a joke to be made about oil burning here.
1379 2018-12-04 21:53:26 私の「Johnson　Baby　Oil」の服を見たアルゼンチンの子が「アタイが小さい頃……弟のケツに…塗ってたわ……」って言い出して、ははん。てなった。それだけ。赤ちゃんのケツにはみんないろいろ塗るよな。オムツのムレで乾燥しやすいもんな。わかるよ。
1380 2018-12-04 21:53:14 Okay cool he has a different voting record on you don't agree with. Just like I believe that global warming is a threat and won't be solved by politicians being paid off by big oil. Crazy how that works huh?
1381 2018-12-04 21:53:10 Israel is weak. It's military is heavilly subsidised by USA. Israel has few, if any natural resources & an increasingly toxic brand throughout the world. Once new technology ends US oil dependency, it's funding will cease & the facade will crumble
1382 2018-12-04 21:53:08 Too much oil
1383 2018-12-04 21:53:07 Why would trump do anything to lessen Americas reliance on oil, or encourage research on renewable energy? He has to keep his good friend, that's the one who ordered the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, happy.
1384 2018-12-04 21:53:06 For all you girls that don’t get to hear this every morning.
 
YOUR CAR NEEDS TO HAVE ITS OIL CHANGED EVERY 3,000 MILES!!!!!!
1385 2018-12-04 21:52:36 So what essential oil will make me stop being a dumb bitch
1386 2018-12-04 21:52:33 for me,
achieving success is 
getting past oil & war & bringing
world peace.
wish me luck.

1387 2018-12-04 21:52:28 Call them and ask the price on a basic oil change with synthetic
1388 2018-12-04 21:52:27 Google Cannabis Oil Extract Bottles from 1850 and wake up! It helps with over 700 medical conditions and I've been using for 40yrs. and am on NO PILLS. It keeps me out of a wheelchair and active. But you keep telling yourself you're right. But you're wrong! @drbobmelamede
1389 2018-12-04 21:52:24 oh I love to sniff things. there were little stands in the lobby today w people selling soaps & candles & stuff and I sniffed Everything sniffable, and bought a peppermint & tea tree oil soap that I can now sniff at my desk the rest of the day
1390 2018-12-04 21:52:22 I’m tired of these bogus troops fighting for oil when they should be fighting for the American Dream

1392 2018-12-04 21:52:02 What are you guys doing for this New Moon in Sagittarius?? 

I'm going to cleanse some crystals, meditate, and if I can find FULL rose petals then I'm going to take a hot bath with rose petals and lavendar oil
1393 2018-12-04 21:51:59 I love how nothing is wrong with my car just need to oil up the front shocks and it's perfect
1394 2018-12-04 21:51:54 We don’t need any of that. We actually produce more oil than we need. We make fear of Iran and coddling of Israel paramount.
1395 2018-12-04 21:51:53 The way crony statism shares back its revenues, it could very well be very progressive. I come from Venezuela, where the poorest 40% got, from the Bolivarian Revolution, the last 15 years, less than 15% of the nations net oil revenues, had these been shared out equally to all. 
1396 2018-12-04 21:51:45 You know what else comes at the expense of the taxpayer? Billions in corporate welfare for big oil that takes in hundreds of billions yearly and do irreparable damage to the earth. I’d take investment in clean energy any day.
1397 2018-12-04 21:51:38 But on the other hand, why should it matter one way or the other? Oil and gas is a huge industry in Texas. Beto was running in Texas. Why is this even a thing?

I wish my liberal community would grow up and be practical and pragmatic.
1398 2018-12-04 21:51:27 Awon Annoiting Oil ministry
1399 2018-12-04 21:51:24 oils freak me out cause i used to do rosehip oil and tea tree oil and it literally fucked my skin so bad
1400 2018-12-04 21:51:21 Weird that there was zero mention of soy oil crushing and it's association with pigs farms - soy oil seems to get an easy ride, unlike palm oil production
1401 2018-12-04 21:51:15 Does this include the UK? My boyfriend uses CBD oil for his anxiety and it would be amazing to find some better ones out there.
1402 2018-12-04 21:51:13 I'm going to sell some coconut oil this weekend. I finally got a fucking job
1403 2018-12-04 21:51:08 Oil and fracking? Where do those PET bags come from before they are recycled?

1407 2018-12-04 21:50:31 I mean, look at the good side dude. The U.S is gonna look in another part of the world for that sweet sweet oil
1408 2018-12-04 21:50:29 I do a mask by that Shea Butter line 2x a week. I only wash my face in Oil of Olay about 3x a week and then I use aloe vera (plant),cocoa butter and coconut oil as my moisturizers.  
1409 2018-12-04 21:50:27 I gave you the latest designs. Did you even bother looking at a Gen III? Look, if you want to keep burning coal and oil, that's what's going to happen, until liberals start supporting a middle step like nuclear and NG.
1410 2018-12-04 21:50:21 @BNNBloomberg Just listening to another “expert” (Peterson from Manulife). More BS. The last expert I heard from last week said 5-7% Xmas rally! Dow down 800 today! One B4 that:”oil won’t go below $55”! I think experts don’t have a clue right now. Wish they’d be honest.
1411 2018-12-04 21:50:18 Pointing what out?

Pointing out that 0.6% (429K) of his $70 million in donations came from Oil/Gas employees when he ran in the state of Texas?

Whew! Groundbreaking stuff! Truly devious! 
1412 2018-12-04 21:50:17 Why would ALTA & SASK 1st Ministers even attend 1st Ministers meeting when Oil & Gas issues not placed on the agenda.

1414 2018-12-04 21:50:07 Got in my grandmas car with perfectly fine shoes. Get out and theres motor oil that dripped from somewhere in her car on my suede boots. My grandma ass should be paying to replace them. PERIODT
1415 2018-12-04 21:50:07 They only do for some days. I bought this oil that helps with the itch
1416 2018-12-04 21:49:50 @RONAinc @Maytag_CA the worse service ever. Been 1 month and still no luck with proper assistance. Washer broke after first use and leaked oil. This is not acceptable. Washer needs to be picked up and money refunded. #dontbuy

1418 2018-12-04 21:49:43 Lavender oil and sunny stones like citrine and carnelian are my go-to’s when I’m experiencing a lot of anxiety!

1422 2018-12-04 21:49:20 A76 first ‘SoftBank-ARM’ core made w/ expanded budget and R&D resources subsidized by Saudi Vision oil-to-tech migration dollars. Masayoshi Son told Segars ‘go, go, go!,’ Even Trump fights on their side, lol...

1425 2018-12-04 21:48:55 The United States likely surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s largest crude oil producer earlier this year,based on preliminary estimates in EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).Trump Admin may plan to try to choke off Iranian oil and supplant it with Saudi.
1426 2018-12-04 21:48:45 @Busisa74 - have observed some@cooking oil brands now officially retailing >$9; has the lid been lifted on prices? Are there no more currency subsidies? Am a #PricesHauntedCitizenZw seeking some answers to the #Zwpricesmadness
1427 2018-12-04 21:48:42 these donations came AFTER the 2018 election, are all by individual donors, and Beto is leading #1 for receiving donations from oil and gas as well as MOST other industries. Plenty to criticize about Beto, this isn’t one. Just a dog whistle to ppl who seek to undermine Dems
1428 2018-12-04 21:48:41 Our oil...damn tootin 
1429 2018-12-04 21:48:26 Canola oil?
1430 2018-12-04 21:48:25 Graham is wrong - MBS is not crazy, he is ruthless and empowered by oil money. It is Trump that is crazy.
1431 2018-12-04 21:48:24 Electric or hybrid vehicles are not the answer. Where does the electricity come from and they still use gas and oil products. Perpetual motion with friction generators and magnets are the way, but current industry can't make their almighty dollar from them...Their are answers...

1435 2018-12-04 21:48:17 One year everyone on my list got tiny bottles of vinegar and oil for Christmas  
1436 2018-12-04 21:48:17 If Beto wants my vote he's going to have to put in 2 solid years of moving left. He'll need to stop taking oil & gas money (he won't), he'll need to admit climate change is real (he won't) and he'll have to sign on to the #GreenNewDeal (he won't). Beto is neoliberal shit.
1437 2018-12-04 21:48:10 Some of these Unionist tits are making this about oil... oh dear the  is slip-sliding away..
1438 2018-12-04 21:47:59 You have to assess the fact that he's in Texas, where oil is king. That being said he is about as centrist as a candidate can be, which plays well in deep red Texas, but won't in the big 3 blue states of CA, NY, & IL. Nor will it WA, OR, or New England.
1439 2018-12-04 21:47:52 Fascists plan long-term & act fast once in power--first thing they do is eliminate all dissents & opponents (through smearing, torture or murder)... Ecuadorians must rise up and remove #Moreno before his taste for blood & oil increases further. @JorgeGlas @AssangeDefence
1440 2018-12-04 21:47:48 Towing the ol' "We have no money because we gave it away" line. 

The money is gone

If you want to compare with NS..AB will be NS soon enough...they based their entire economy on one tradeable product (AB=Oil, NS=Fisheries)

You see it coming though, so I wont be too hard on ya
1441 2018-12-04 21:47:46 I can never tell when you are serious. Benjamin couldn’t separate from oil if his name was vinegar.
1442 2018-12-04 21:47:41 Is this the same one that said coconut oil is basically poison
1443 2018-12-04 21:47:38 We know it, just don't care. My oil bill is high enough.
1444 2018-12-04 21:47:36 She thicker than cold motor oil
1445 2018-12-04 21:47:34 Just think, the EU could dump Iranian oil, buy Canadian oil and help get rid of these oppressors - of course Canada would have to build a pipeline to the East (and we know that ain’t going to happen)
1446 2018-12-04 21:47:15 me: we’re slaves to the oil companies
my gigantic brain grandpa: but do you have a job tho?
1447 2018-12-04 21:47:05 oregano oil will knock it out
1448 2018-12-04 21:46:58 I need to get some Coconut Oil
1449 2018-12-04 21:46:57 So....what control do the Saudis have on the price of the oil we buy from Canada or other countries?  If it's too complicated to explain I understand. I don't mean to seem dense, but there are a lot of variables here.

1454 2018-12-04 21:46:30 She's gonna need some holy anointing oil real soon.
1455 2018-12-04 21:46:19 Today, EV’s displace 1 minute of global daily oil production.  In 2 decades, exceeding the wildest estimates of IEA, it could grow to 100 minutes of today’s demand. Demand growth is between 1% and 2% per year, so 60 to 88 minutes.
1456 2018-12-04 21:46:18 Ian Wood blew his credibility with his emphatic predictions on oil sustainability during the 2014 referendum.
1457 2018-12-04 21:46:16 Don't be fooled. Lower gas prices have nothing to do who's president. Big oil DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. Big oil likes deregulations republicans offer. Not only that but big oil also enjoys tax breaks at rates that middle class people couldn't even dream of. #gasprices

1462 2018-12-04 21:45:52 Iraq and Lebanon agree to revive the trans Levant oil pipeline.
1463 2018-12-04 21:45:19 Brent/WTI differentials are due to transport constraints from Cushings to Louisiana, The LLS/Brent Spread is only on $1-3. Also US oil production is going to be slowing now into Q1
1464 2018-12-04 21:45:18 One of the ways of plundering pensioners in #Russia is the annual flow of smuggling of oil products to Germany for more than $2bill, without let or hindrance carried out by corrupt officials ofthe #German MinistryofTransport with the tacit consent of the #Putin
1465 2018-12-04 21:45:17 Tea tree oil is a miracle worker!
1466 2018-12-04 21:45:14 Invading for oil? You mean building up their infrastructure and economies?
1467 2018-12-04 21:45:11 I think we all need to know if the oil is worth ones man’s life.
1468 2018-12-04 21:45:10 Y’all out of oil lol what kinda shit is that
1469 2018-12-04 21:45:08 I suppose it depends on what your riding, how often your riding it and how short your gears are....I remember my old commuter, i geared it short and did a lot of milage...chain, sprocket and a new rear tyre every month amongst oil, filters etc 
1470 2018-12-04 21:45:07 If there is a better thing in this life than a newly opened bottle of Olbas Oil, then I’ve yet to find it.
1471 2018-12-04 21:45:00 Oreo? hmmmm not good they use dirty palm oil that kills the orangutans
1472 2018-12-04 21:44:49 I have no problem with Scotland being independent, just show me figures to show survival in absence of oil, but importantly "staying independent" NOT handing powers taken from Westminster straight to Brussels
1473 2018-12-04 21:44:46 where can i buy a juul just found out they make hash oil cartridges for juuls

1476 2018-12-04 21:44:31 kennedy, reagan and obama were leaders

1478 2018-12-04 21:44:29 It seems the Arabian gulf countries can get away with anything, because the west supposedly 'needs' its oil. Maybe a military expedition to establish a rules based western democracy. LoL

1480 2018-12-04 21:44:14 I can't fix the puzzle here. 

At #COP24, while the world focus on #ClimateAction & moving away from #FossilFuels; Swiss president at a so-called bilateral conversation with Nigeria's President, discussed how Swiss hopes to import Oil from Nigeria.

Who can fix this puzzle? Urgh!
1481 2018-12-04 21:44:05 it was oil and gas ceos and executives not workers lol
1482 2018-12-04 21:43:59 Ok i will check it out, but since this is not currently law yet, Im not sure how this has caused the price in oil to collapse in alberta.
1483 2018-12-04 21:43:58 Oil pads are so fucking ugly it’s upsetting
1484 2018-12-04 21:43:52 The stew I cooked this evening make sense gan!

Palm oil stew always makes sense sha.
1485 2018-12-04 21:43:45 Then we agree. The Democrats care about workers, social justice, free press and movies, while the Republicans care about guns and oil. And since you clearly hadn't noticed: there are people of every political flavor who hate Jews.
1486 2018-12-04 21:43:40 Great chart, do you think oil will move with the overall market? Your outlook on oil would be greatly appreciated
1487 2018-12-04 21:43:24 You would @Ocasio2018 would be picking on the coal and oil lobby.
1488 2018-12-04 21:43:18 I bet he wants to take credit for that, just like he did the domestic oil and gas boom.

He said dryly.
1511 2018-12-04 21:41:28 True, but if the world price was back to $120 a barrel: the differential would still be the same, but the oil would be profitable.
1512 2018-12-04 21:41:28 I am here in Texas, saw the enthusiasm for myself. Many houses in my nice conservative neighborhood and Beto signs/bumper stickers. Many of these folks (including me) either work directly or indirectly with oil companies. Beto=Progressive=could get stuff done. Really that simple.

1515 2018-12-04 21:41:10 @C60redlion Hi, I just ordered to grams of pulverized c60. I am on my second order now and I think you have a great product. I combines with the oil much faster so its ready to use much faster than other c60 I have bought. How long is the back order wait?
1516 2018-12-04 21:41:01 Sprinkle a little salt in your pan if you're frying. This will prevent the oil from splattering.
1517 2018-12-04 21:41:00 It’s as if you’re driving down the road and your oil light comes on. It’s going to cost you to get it checked, get an oil change. So you just keep driving. The long term costs are far greater than the short term expense. That’s our current GOP tactic
1518 2018-12-04 21:41:00 Do u think oil will close it's gap after that Api data before it shoots higher?
1519 2018-12-04 21:40:50 I think the issue is the lack of context here. Saying Beto gets a lot of $ from oil and gas elicits a common view of corruption - that Beto is taking corp $$ and PAC money. When we dig in a realize you're counting individual donations based on employer, it seems a bit underhanded
1520 2018-12-04 21:40:42 Getting my oil changed at @Valvoline and 2/3 workers are women. Just that fact has earned my repeat business.
1521 2018-12-04 21:40:40 Decision makers, address the biggest polluters first (raw oil driven vessels, coal power plants, ...)! Ask the scientist what has the largest impact and don’t wait for the ultimative best answer, be courageous, act now, set strong and short deadlines – please!

1548 2018-12-04 21:38:44 I'm waiting for the WSJ to attack Canada's carbon tax which is literally pulled from the conservative playbook - its revenue neutral, which means it aligns not only with GOP stalwarts like James Baker but with Exxon and other large oil producers.

1604 2018-12-04 21:34:00 Subsidies encourage investment and innovation.  It will take investment to build the infrastructure necessary for the next energy cycle.  Oil is cheap and easy.  Without government investment, we will burn up our planet.

Or am I missing something?
1663 2018-12-04 21:27:30 Remove the royal family leadership that is getting filthy rich along with the wahabbi sect of Islam that allows them to rule, and the middle east becomes a bit more easier to stabilize. They have been playing us since the oil embargo of the 70's. Playing both sides is bad.
1664 2018-12-04 21:27:29 Calm down and try to stay in control of your emotions. Beto O’Rourke is the #2 recipient of oil/gas industry campaign cash in the entire Congress which makes him a top notch scumbag.

1685 2018-12-04 21:25:29 Most ppl relate to you b/c they hate seeing animals they find cute in captions of quandary. Then go home&eat them while signing a petition to save cute ones. But is that bad? No one gave a shit about palm oil or Orangutan. Mayb it helps us all believe gingers have a soul
1686 2018-12-04 21:25:28 Also, we only get 40% of our oil from domestic sources. So that still means more than half is from other countries. So again, what harm would it do to make that number smaller and also lessen our reliance on a very finite resource?
1687 2018-12-04 21:25:28 All their money is in gas, oil and coal.

1693 2018-12-04 21:24:47 It would be interesting to see how big oil influences local land planning committees. Detroit once had plenty of useful public transportation. Big oil and the auto industry sustain each other.

1737 2018-12-04 21:20:52 I remember when the collapse in price structure of other extraction commodities like copper, oil, and silver led to the collapse of those industries.  Does anyone else remember?
1738 2018-12-04 21:20:52 Just to clear things up: yoga in the park - not a substitution for coconut oil bowls.
1739 2018-12-04 21:20:51 A U.S. prosecutor told a jury Tuesday that a "cheating" Hong Kong businessman undermined faith in the international market by lining the pockets of two African presidents to secure oil rights for a Chinese energy conglomerate.

1742 2018-12-04 21:20:24 Yes. Big Oil spent 10s of millions to stop state-level Carbon Pricing, pointing us to the single most effective action to reduce use of fossil fuels in our energy economy. Support the federal Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act to jumpstart green jobs.

1748 2018-12-04 21:19:53 Professor Jaccard told me (and CBC listeners) yesterday that Denmark doesn’t have an oil industry and is prosperous, therefore Canada would not miss the $33 billion trade surplus we get from our crude oil.
1749 2018-12-04 21:19:47 LOL Stoners think CBD oil cures EVERYTHING
1750 2018-12-04 21:19:42 The great wealth of our nation. Is this why we rape and bomb countries for oil and resources. Gee where do we get this wealth.
1751 2018-12-04 21:19:36 Remember when Marty first goes to 1955 in Back to the Future? Remember the 5 guys that checked the oil, cleaned the windshield put air in the tires and pumped the gas at the gas station? Well those jobs no longer exist due to the minimum wage.

1755 2018-12-04 21:19:30 Read his own platform.  He is being characterized as an oil lobbyist, when he said things like climate change is man made and a serious threat.  In tx.  Which lost him votes.

No I’m not his payroll lol, what kinda accusation is that.

1759 2018-12-04 21:18:58 (5) I’m the only one in our house that doesn’t smoke weed, now he and I both vape with CBD oil in our flavors with help my anxiety. It’s cool w/ him cause I’ll help buy it, I’ll roll for him, or I’ll grind his stuff up. It’s no problem as long as I personally don’t use it.

1761 2018-12-04 21:18:48 Told u. Phillies have no shot. No one wants to play for coconut oil himself. Maybe get machado but he said he won’t hustle. Haha good luck with that in Philly
1762 2018-12-04 21:18:45 They benefited from an easily accessible oil market in the early years of production, granting their government enough revenue through sales and businesses taxes to avoid a PST. It's not that the money wasn't collected, it just came from somewhere else.
1763 2018-12-04 21:18:38 Absolute zero ability to see and hear because you choose to remain ignorant and led by your mainstream media propaganda Puppet Masters. Just parrot what they say... talk about 10 for oil hats
1764 2018-12-04 21:18:38 Agree, a vastly more preferable career choice for  @BetoORourke This guy has eaten so much Oil&Gas Lucre, that he is now unctuous, oily, and full of gas. #Bernie2020 destroys Billionaires, Beto wants to be one. Yuuuge difference
1765 2018-12-04 21:18:23 Having a car in college is hard, people are always asking you for rides & they don’t even offer gas money. Do y’all even know how much a oil change is or a new set a tires cost. It all adds up, & I’m not the kind to ask.
1766 2018-12-04 21:18:18 So I went to Walmart to get an oil change and some dude kept staring at me and the next day I get a friend request from him , how the fuck did he find me on facebook
1767 2018-12-04 21:18:08 And I’m not defending big oil interests.
1768 2018-12-04 21:18:03 I follow you due to the innovation and success you are bringing to the canaboid oil industry. 

So many more milestones to reach, I am excited to follow you along the way.
1769 2018-12-04 21:18:00 Be delighted to leave, take all our exports back that are sent out thu English ports, take our Whisky revenue back, not to mention our increasing oil industry. As for being well provide for, we pay a minimum of £68B to the Treasury    and get £37B back. Good Deal!
1770 2018-12-04 21:17:50 but you voted for Transferable Tax History today in the Finance Bill Committee :( we need a fast transition from oil & gas. We need @TheSNP and you to be real climate leaders. Sooner rather thn later you will need to tell Scotland the truth to about climate limits to oil and gas.
1771 2018-12-04 21:17:49 Coconut oil, works for everything 
1772 2018-12-04 21:17:48 data is the crude oil of the 21st century. It has no value until it's refined #plannerparley

EURGH! Never again.

1779 2018-12-04 21:17:12 Its too bad we haven't started with that "economic diversity " that was promised. Maybe it wouldn't even matter what yhe price of oil was at. The problem is we rely on one thing to spur the economy and that one thing is obsolete. We're basically a blockbuster video store.
1780 2018-12-04 21:17:11 #SaturatedFats are also found in a few vegetable oils, such as palm oil, coconut oil, hydrogenated oils, and chocolate. #HeartHealth
1781 2018-12-04 21:17:10 What oil crisis?  The one where oil still exists but Alberta isn't making a ton of money to waste & not save for the future?
1782 2018-12-04 21:17:07 Crude oil, grains/oilseeds paid no attention to stocks, trade-war concerns, interest rate, and Econ concerns. The model shows buyers were interested in corn into the close; likely had not met needs. But I am staying with the AM comment on trend possibilities. #corn2018
1783 2018-12-04 21:17:06 2037: Largest oil company on the planet issues statement admonishing environmentalist groups for ‘not doing more to stop them,’
1784 2018-12-04 21:17:02 Oil is not a renewable energy source. If the Scottish government promised to leave it in the ground, would yer man JC, if he were PM, give full control back to Scotland? Would he work with the left of centre SNP to eradicate poverty in my country?

1786 2018-12-04 21:16:51 How are small individual donations equivalent to “bought by oil and gas”, exactly? It’s Texas, of course there will be individual contributions from employees in that industry. The claims here are intellectually dishonest.
1787 2018-12-04 21:16:51 It's the opposite. If the price of oil remains low, Saudi oil remains the primary source as it is cheapest. If we can raise the price, Canada can affordably produce oil. We can't afford to put people to work if oil is so cheap all we o is buy from Saudi Arabia.
1788 2018-12-04 21:16:49 It happens to my knuckles and on the sides of my nails on my thumbs. My hands being wet and in hair all day don’t help. I use coconut oil after the shower and a lotion the dermatologist recommended on my hands before bed and it helps so much.
1789 2018-12-04 21:16:35 I don't think that sufficiently compensates for encroaching automation in a lot of industries, trucking, oil, and gas in particular. And automation doesn't produce as many jobs as it takes away. If it did, then employers wouldn't bother.
1790 2018-12-04 21:16:35 Oh man, I've been wanting to do the same. Does it take much oil to get 'em crisp?

So, in my expert opinion, what Alan is selling is snake oil.
1793 2018-12-04 21:16:06 May the Lord hear the groaning of your heart. May you receive peace that surpasses all understanding. May all your fears be quelled.

1795 2018-12-04 21:15:51 Could see the Oil do it, offer them a nice young piece or a pick inexchange for the promise that Seattle will select his big dumb ass. like the Ducks did with Vegas, “here’s Shea Theodore if you take Clayton Stoners bum ass” helped the Ducks not lose Josh Manson & open cap

I would suspect russia who as an oil economy

You know nothing about farming either grain or live stock so go back to the rock you crawled from underneath. I will support any industry that I choose and that is all Agriculture related things plus the Oil & gas sector. That should really get your hemp in a knot
1802 2018-12-04 21:15:13  that $200 oil change just not worth the flex

1811 2018-12-04 21:14:22 Im Canadian and I witness many conservatives here push the same lines the Americans do. Job losses in the oil field + ignorance + propaganda. Some expect booms in various sectors to be consistent. When they drop they rail against the govt, rather than look for new employment.

1823 2018-12-04 21:13:54 When I die, and get reincarnated I want to be an octopus, quite solitary, quite violent towards crabs and other selfish shellfish, yet extraordinarily brilliant and intelligent, the euphemisms I'll spell with my oil will be exuberant, plus the meme's.

1825 2018-12-04 21:13:38 President Trump's tweet were incredibly effective in halting $100 oil. But as a brilliant business man he also understands that $50 oil won't get many Big Oil companys to donate to his campaign and it will hurt American jobs sooner rather than later.

1830 2018-12-04 21:13:01 The whole cheap gas thing is a result of the Saudis dropped the price of crude oil to try to avoid repercussions from the murder. I'm sure if we impose sanctions, the Saudis will likely retaliate by increasing the oil price or cutting off the supply. I'm afraid gas will spike.

1833 2018-12-04 21:12:54 Most in the industry are marvelling at a socialist approach by a government on the right? Known as the ‘band aid and snake oil approach’. Translated, that means - you have no idea what you are doing with energy!
1834 2018-12-04 21:12:46 so? your president said he's allowed to slaughter journalists because he sells you so much oil.
1835 2018-12-04 21:12:39 3. 1 kg natural uranium corresponds to nearly 10,000 kg of mineral oil or 14,000 kg of coal to generate 45,000 kWh of electricity.
1836 2018-12-04 21:12:36 Hahaha... the capitalist society can’t be bought. Wait, breathe. Blahaha. Seriously. $100 bbl oil is the only answer. It’s a good thing China and Mexico don’t kill journalist.

1840 2018-12-04 21:12:15 The oil and gas industries are looking for people, and are willing to pay good money for them. People have to go were the jobs are. Some states are more business friendly than others.

1844 2018-12-04 21:11:36 I think I once had pasta with cheese and truffle oil at a European festival in Sydney and it was pretty great. But, I dunno how that works with crisps; chips.
1845 2018-12-04 21:11:26 Keep in mind I’m not saying consumers are the biggest cause of these environmental problems (its big industry n conrporations, oil industry, etc) but as consumers we can make changes too :) and spread awareness

1851 2018-12-04 21:10:52 Of all the things Beto is bad about (i.e: pro-Israel) getting donations from gas and oil employees isn't one of them. He has a basically perfect pro-environment voting record
1852 2018-12-04 21:10:48 Då är det den spelningen. Jo Oil in the Eye spelade samtidigt och på Valvet. Hade glömt. Kände ju inte själv igen folket. Hittade dock lite dagboksanteckningar typ ”var med Mika på spelning i Göteborg”

1855 2018-12-04 21:10:41 5 things that I like that aren’t books or people:

1) doges and cats of the world 
2) The Last Jedi
3) Anti colonialism/anti racism 
4)Buffalo Motza with some Olive Oil and just a pinch of sea salt
5) hearing “By the power of Greyskull”

1862 2018-12-04 21:10:11 Yes, but actually it's closer to 22% if you add additional like engine/transmission oil, gas & oil additives, and tires.  However, they control 85% of the price of fuel.

1868 2018-12-04 21:09:47 A powerful and genuinely informed speech by Margaret Beckett in @HouseofCommons re #BrexitDebate #MeaningfulVote 

So few politicians of her calibre these days. We rely mostly on charlatans selling snake oil. Let's #SleighBrexit for Christmas (get it?) and have a #PeoplesVote
1869 2018-12-04 21:09:29 I would like to know how the Nigerian tradition of gifting rice and oil at Christmas came about. Anybody know?

1872 2018-12-04 21:09:24 I see no reason to think so, but I see a direct line from oil monoculture via falling oil market to economic trouble. Bur if you have a convincing argument, let's see it.

1876 2018-12-04 21:09:01 Fresh politicians avoid confrontations with AIPAC, not to be crushed. Everyone knows that. That is if you wanted to last. Another thing is to shake hands with oil barons . A stupid new politician aims high first.
1877 2018-12-04 21:08:57 Wtf are you talking about? Beto takes the second largest amount of donations from the oil/gas industry. That’s a fact.

1882 2018-12-04 21:08:37 it appears Oil and Gas gave 429,000 to O'Rourke and 500,000 to Ted Cruz. Their two top contributions

1890 2018-12-04 21:08:03 This is real question. 

What do you get a 46 year old man that’s done literally everything for you for Christmas?? He’s in the oil field and buys himself whatever he wants so gifts for him are hard af.  

This is my father in case your perverted mind went somewhere else.
1891 2018-12-04 21:07:52 No.  Call an early election in Alberta.  The premier can’t unilaterally nationalize the oil industry in Canada and let the US and Saudi Arabia sell as much as they can to Canada.  Her cartel plan can’t work when competitors can still operate.  The idea is ludicrous.
1892 2018-12-04 21:07:48 Wine. Drink. Soda. Nuts. Vinegar. Seed oil. Jelly. Leaves. Raisin. These all come from one source: the lowly grape. Maybe think next time before you trash talk it. I can't stand people sometimes.
1893 2018-12-04 21:07:39 Pinterest is wild, you can't have a cookie recipe that you bill as """"oil-free"""", when it has HALF A UP OF PEANUT BUTTER.

HEY.

THATS FUKKEN OIL, DAWG
1894 2018-12-04 21:07:39 if you ever got curious about frying your finger in hot oil, i did that for you. it hurts. don't do it.
1895 2018-12-04 21:07:38 So employees of has/oil companies donatevtheor personal money to a candidate and it represents the oil industry? That's like my donations to the dnc represent the hotel industry

1899 2018-12-04 21:07:03 Oil money  is apparently mighty tasty.  What’s Saudi for kompromat?
1900 2018-12-04 21:06:57 why do white people think olive oil is a seasoning
1901 2018-12-04 21:06:56 Do u think the Sunday Oil Gap will get closed Mr. Mancini?
1902 2018-12-04 21:06:48 They live in Texas. LOTS of people who live in Texas work for the oil industry. Correlation does not equal causation. Or are you against people who work for a for-profit industry being able to back their chosen candidates, while following all the laws about amounts & disclosure?
1903 2018-12-04 21:06:42 What will you do to keep our oil rigs in production in Canada?  @theCAODC report shows increasing production cuts next year and our most technologically advanced rigs headed south despite the differential. @JustinTrudeau calls it a crisis and sits idle #abgov #cdnpoli #ableg

1906 2018-12-04 21:06:33 Oj! Nu kände jag igen Manuel Puyo från Oil In The Eye. De spelade på Valvet i Göteborg tillsammans med Emetic och Cat Rapes Dog i maj 1990. Jag stod längst fram och sov över i skivaffären Interzone efteråt. Skinheads kastade flaskor genom fönstren innan konserten började.
1907 2018-12-04 21:06:33 “We’ll trade your oil for ours”.
1908 2018-12-04 21:06:33 motor oil isnt for drinking
1909 2018-12-04 21:06:32 Is taking a -4 advisable ?
1910 2018-12-04 21:06:15 Lmao you always needed us we don’t depend on oil anymore thank to mbs our economy is much better and depends on many resources also let’s not forget last time Saudi and us had an argument what happened to the us
1911 2018-12-04 21:06:13 Oh Bullshit. only 45% of the ownership is in IRA or pensions the rest is split among management companies individual investors and the Oil companies themselves, Exxons profit for 2017 totaled $19.7 billion they've been receiving tax writeoffs for billions of dollars
1912 2018-12-04 21:06:10 Isn’t this what “people” want? Please threaten me with 90-100$ a barrel of oil. I work in the oil and gas industry. I have my free gas card.

After a long day at school I like to come home and change into something more comfortable 

2. Wash your face 
This helps with getting off all the oil of your face from being at school and refreshes you
1915 2018-12-04 21:05:51 You really don’t save much maybe $18-20 easier to just let them do it then you also don’t have to take your old oil in to dispose it
1916 2018-12-04 21:05:45 Puhleeze. You don’t think “oil/gas *industry* campaign cash” suggests something beyond simply putting info out there?And “triggers”? How DARE people try to correct the insinuation you were clearly trying to make! If you don’t recognize your insinuation, retake freshman writing.
1917 2018-12-04 21:05:39 Current thought  getting an oil change is as bad as going to the dentist
1918 2018-12-04 21:05:35 help. I’m addicted to the smell of pure tea-tree oil.... 
1919 2018-12-04 21:05:32 The glut is in Canada though. Notley just said we will cut our own production because of it. It would not look good politically to continue to import Saudi oil if EE was in place and Canada has a glut of our oil sitting in storage. EE was killed by politics prov and fed
1920 2018-12-04 21:05:27 And the Maccabees were obviously in the pockets of Big Oil
We need a solar Hanukkah miracle /snark
Still, a solar Hanukkah miracle would be nice.
1921 2018-12-04 21:05:27 The vicious cycle of capitalism. Forget your principles. Buy oil from X and X will send the money back to you to buy guns. In turn, just be their saviors and show them where to use those guns once in a while so they need replacements.
1922 2018-12-04 21:04:56 There’s a massive difference between the global supply glut in 2015 and the Canadian, self inflicted oil crisis of 2018-20XX. 

We will never have the ability to influence OPEC production but we always have the ability to expand our own infrastructure, if the Fed Gov allows it.

1928 2018-12-04 21:03:54 He reported on one single fact and didn’t even frame it as criticism. Beto receives the 2nd highest amount of money from the oil/gas industry. That is a fact. Deal with it.

1933 2018-12-04 21:03:14 Alberta technically owns the oil and gets a royalty every barrel exported. That royalty is based on a formula that considers the price of oil. Alberta loses millions in royalties when WCS is low so has a vested interest to ensure that they get fair value for a finite resource
1934 2018-12-04 21:03:05 Energy experts debate: some say we have abundant oil and tight carbon, others say we have tight oil. Even if we ignore the climate crisis, we still must transform our energy infrastructure and economy radically. Note at least short term growth worsens the climate crisis.

1936 2018-12-04 21:02:48 1/2 Notley continually expects Canadians to bail out the dirtiest oil in the world for the benefit of Albertans. Kenny, an immigrant from Ontario, backs up ownership by saying that the oil belongs only to Albertans. Nothing federal here.

1982 2018-12-04 20:58:34 The founder of the weather channel is a shill for the oil companies. All of the people the question how much human activity has to do with global warming are.... I mean climate change. They re packaged it after climate gate
1983 2018-12-04 20:58:30 White chocolate isn’t easy to melt down because it isn’t real chocolate. But a tip is adding a bit of oil or shortening to help it not burn while on a double boiler. Low heat.
1984 2018-12-04 20:58:21 The current economic situation and the lack of export capacity is already impacting jobs. A temporary reduction in oil production will help stabilize the situation by ensuring Albertans are getting a fair price for our oil resources.

1988 2018-12-04 20:58:02 also I should point out that electric cars have nothing to do with renewables, which is what I commented on. But do with oil, which is more on topic with this thread and would have been a more accurate post for you to originally make. I agree that the Gov't should invest in them

Disheartening that our team with Klopp at the helm is existing at a time with a club fuelled by oil money and underhand tactics with a great manager.
1995 2018-12-04 20:57:15 The oil...is that what this about? It’s not in Shetlands waters? Dumbo 
1996 2018-12-04 20:57:11 The Good Neighbor Policy of FDR terminated US Marine occupation of Nicaragua in 1933, occupation of Haiti in 1934, annulment of the Platt Amendment by the Treaty of Relations with Cuba in 1934, got Mexico compensation for foreign-owned oil assets. That's good foreign policy.
1997 2018-12-04 20:57:10 Beard oil reviews are proving to be some of the strangest and desperate displays of masculinity I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing
1998 2018-12-04 20:57:09 But i dont see oil on the road or under the truck or any where really which is baffling me
1999 2018-12-04 20:56:57 Lmfao. Did you even recognize that you willfully generalized every single person who works for oil companies as executives or did you do it on purpose to erase the fact that regular people who care about the same issues and wants the same outcomes as you work for these companies?
2000 2018-12-04 20:56:55 Red oil cassava leaf
2001 2018-12-04 20:56:52 From Israel’s perspective, yes. Knocking off a Sunni leader ruling over a Shia State was idiotic, although Israel did get the Kurdish oil.

However, the US should be an offshore balancer, ensuring that no one power dominates Persian Gulf oil supplies.
2002 2018-12-04 20:56:49 Right, my feet are frozen, very little battery on laptop, I'm off to bed to pump up oil lamp and try to read a little, sweet dreams everyone...XXX
2003 2018-12-04 20:56:48 Better oil dey your head
2004 2018-12-04 20:56:46 It's true it took a long time to accumulate fossil fuels, but they're not from the extinction of the dinosaurs (or other extinctions). Oil is the result of unconsumed plankton accumulating on the ocean floor, coal is mostly from plants that died in the carboniferous period.
2005 2018-12-04 20:56:45 ENBRIDGE IS SAID TO SHUT MAINLINE OIL PIPE ON SASK. POWER LOSS. 

time for more alberta production cuts
2006 2018-12-04 20:56:43 I guess all the good PR people jumped ship when key left to go get some of that sweet tobacco/oil/ arms dealing money
2007 2018-12-04 20:56:35 I did, there's barely any oil.  it was fine a week ago.
2008 2018-12-04 20:56:33 @StateDept oh please! You're done with wars and deception just wanting Oil and natural mineral wealth, need to control the world
2009 2018-12-04 20:56:27 Add some Astragalus, Rehmannia, and Nigella sativa oil for extra immune system support. This looks SOLID though! And yummy too!
2010 2018-12-04 20:56:26 Rather than “accepting the request”, Trudeau  should have clued in on the importance of the oil diff price issue and added it to the Agenda himself without prompting.
2011 2018-12-04 20:56:08 17/16 then yes that's right most full synthetic oil changes start at 65.
2012 2018-12-04 20:56:05 I don’t know about that, the US did many computer simulation of war with Iran, didn’t come out very well , I think they will wait untill full control of the golf of Aden for oil flow,  when Iran shuts off the straits of Hormuz it will not effect oil flow
2013 2018-12-04 20:55:57 God grant me the financial security to be able to use olive oil with the impunity of a TV chef.
2014 2018-12-04 20:55:54 blocking all the oil companies on twitter? now thats activism. thats direct action. thats
2015 2018-12-04 20:55:53 Better to sell trophies than buy them with dirty oil money I suppose. Enjoy watching your corrupt "club" get kicked out of the Champions League next year
2016 2018-12-04 20:55:53 Obviously Putin’s blackmail on Graham and other Republicans is extremely  strong to get them to throw the Saudis under the bus like this. I  wonder how much oil we’ll switch over from the Saudis to buying from  Rosneft now?

2020 2018-12-04 20:55:35 I got an oil change, niggas can stfu now

2023 2018-12-04 20:54:55 So I just made this lemon scrub with Shea butter and coconut oil

It feels AMAZING on your skin 
2024 2018-12-04 20:54:53 There is a glut of oil on the market. Just buy even more from Canada, we sell you our oil for 75% less than world price anyway. Sometimes morals and ethics actually come before money. Well at least they did before the orange pumpkin became president.
2025 2018-12-04 20:54:49 This lavender oil is strong.
2026 2018-12-04 20:54:48 My favorite thing about today is my express oil change taking over 1 hour, efficiency is excellent
2027 2018-12-04 20:54:43 I respect military if they want to put themselves in harms way in the name of oil and corporations thats their choice
2028 2018-12-04 20:54:36 Look for news re: US oil production around that date (03.06.18). IIRC, top oil producer by 2023. Trump may have tweeted about it that day
2029 2018-12-04 20:54:34 Maybe it's just a branding thing. Let's call it Medicare for Oil and be done with it.
2030 2018-12-04 20:54:30 Doused myself in CBD oil
2031 2018-12-04 20:54:25 Im pretty sure people got a kick out of little 5'2" pregnant me climbing on my brushguard and trying to lay across my truck to reach the oil dipstick. 
2032 2018-12-04 20:54:23 Soybean oil
2033 2018-12-04 20:54:23 Willie Horton and dark money, W oil and anything having to do with Renquist (Flame treason, for example).  The veneer is “upstanding citizenry.”  Bullshit. Republicans have screwed the public for the last 58 years from what I can glean.
2034 2018-12-04 20:54:22 @oh3mgeewtf  bush funeral? O i see. Hope to see oil index move that day
2035 2018-12-04 20:54:17 Come on Eric. The majority of people in Vancouver haven’t worked a day in their lives compared to the work that folks in the oil industry do.
2036 2018-12-04 20:54:11 Beto’s oil money doesn’t make him the preferred candidate of oil companies, but it does signal that they regard him as acceptable and want to retain influence on him.
2037 2018-12-04 20:53:57 Texans will love Medicare for All because to us it sounds like "Medicare for Oil"
2038 2018-12-04 20:53:54 My prof approached me about our class next semester and he told me it’s pretty much free game. So what I’m hearing is RegClar. Medium: Oil?? 
2039 2018-12-04 20:53:53 Ya and how many oil field workers can fix a wind mill or solar panel.  And this is racism cuz why? What jobs are created WoW
2040 2018-12-04 20:53:53 So I bought a chunk of black soap yesterday and I been tryna figure out what ima do with it. Think ima chop a piece off and mix it with tea tree oil  what else could I mix into it? #SkinCareTwitter
2041 2018-12-04 20:53:51 The guy doing my oil change responded to me with “Hakuna matata” and that small exchange made me feel all is right in the world.  #hakunamatata
2042 2018-12-04 20:53:51 Wasn’t her win based primarily on her policy positions? Which of her policies did you find most repellent? It seems Colorado was giving away the store to oil/gas interests.
2043 2018-12-04 20:53:46 I am sure glad I live in an area where the cooking oil isn't pulled from the municipal sewer system
2044 2018-12-04 20:53:43 We should burn Ian Wood instead of oil
2045 2018-12-04 20:53:40 When I lived in Alaska, the oil workers told me about a time when both bushies came to visit, and cocaine was used by one or both, I don't rcall, but certainly bush jr was snorting. Oil workers had no reason to lie.
2046 2018-12-04 20:53:16 It actually depends on the year of the car, Full Synthetic oil changes are not cheap and Included with tire rotation it's about right.
2047 2018-12-04 20:53:11 Yes, except theres no large pattern in Beto's oil/gas donations to be found.
2048 2018-12-04 20:53:10 Gave myself a hot oil treatment I feel like a new woman
2049 2018-12-04 20:53:06 Please stop sounding more and more like Trump, stop being against Trudeau and start explaining what you’re for, and for a change, how you get there-a plan would be nice. Why is it oil oil oil and closed borders, that’s old conservative-where’s the new conservative ideas ?
2050 2018-12-04 20:53:05 sometimes i still think about @cielyngizmo playing "torpedo future" in snake oil
2051 2018-12-04 20:53:05 I'm not really sure...truck is having a melt down. And I am pretty sure it dumped all the oil it had in it. Im hoping that isnt the case but my oil levels were fine and now there is almost none but my truck holds too much to dump so quickly.

2054 2018-12-04 20:52:48 Yeah, yeah, blood for oil. We know how Congress thinks.
2055 2018-12-04 20:52:47 I’m not sure I can find it again — but the list of donors that I saw was basically director level positions and higher (VPs), not the people who work on oil rigs.
2056 2018-12-04 20:52:47 Agreed.  Big Oil has ruled us too long. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
2057 2018-12-04 20:52:38 "So I like to lather myself in baby oil and spin myself in circles in front of The Piggly Wiggly. What of it?" -@TurboGooch3000
2058 2018-12-04 20:52:29 You're a desert kingdom sitting on a boatload of oil.  

Fracking, combined with renewable energies, will continue reducing your relevance to the world.

We do have some beach erosion needing addressed.  Maybe you could sale us some sand if times get too tough for you.
2059 2018-12-04 20:52:22 Important news flash:

The President of The United States will not care about or investigate your murder if it conflicts with a substantial foreign business deal $$ for oil or weapons so whatever you do...don't get killed by Saudi Arabia, Russia, North Korea or any other nation.
2060 2018-12-04 20:52:21 Don’t disagree but we only import about 10% of saudi oil. Trump is using it as an excuse to continue taking care of his secret deals.

Most oil comes from Canada.

2072 2018-12-04 20:51:04 Hot take on potatoes? They're just starch lumps you put butter, oil, and salt on. Any food would taste good.
2073 2018-12-04 20:50:59 to spin your lie about being Energy Independent. We're not. We still import more oil every day than any other nation. 

Good to see you're still independent from facts Chucky.
2074 2018-12-04 20:50:49 Con. Leader @AndrewScheer says he agrees with Rachel Notley and Scott Moe that Alberta's oil and pipeline woes should be at the top of the First Ministers' Meeting agenda on Friday. Notley and Moe sent PMJT a letter urging him to put the issue on the agenda today. #cdnpoli

2087 2018-12-04 20:49:43 Clive, the costs of fuel are volatile under a peak oil regime. Prices went up 20% this year in France, and when the lower 10% spends 40% of their income on fuel, they might rebel a little.  The only option for Macron is to suspend the tax increase.

2094 2018-12-04 20:48:31 Imports of refined product back into Canada? Definitely record this if you can. Would love to publish it on Oil Authority.
2095 2018-12-04 20:48:27 Be careful with what you say about Saudi, an overreaction could cause a world wide oil crisis. I don’t care how they chose to deal with traitors. We have larger issues to be concerned with.
2096 2018-12-04 20:48:25 Do u think we close that Gap in Oil from here?
2097 2018-12-04 20:48:21 You disagree that the Bush family’s wealth comes from oil and spans multiple generations? What are you disagreeing with?
2098 2018-12-04 20:48:17 I love how you can't even spell smear correctly, and continue to insist opposing one pipeline which would have only moved unrefined product for export is equivalent to being "rabidly anti oil."
2099 2018-12-04 20:48:15 First thing I learned were chicken wings which is easy you deep fry wings in hot oil for like 7 to 10 minutes and then you cover it in sauce. Ofc this is basic and you can do more to make it better but it’s a good start

2109 2018-12-04 20:47:14 Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t it part of the @SaudiVision2030 program to raise #Saudi domestic #oil product prices to “world levels”? Surely memory must mislead.

2111 2018-12-04 20:47:11 I never said anything about my opinions about the Saudis, I just disagreed that renewables would reduce our dependence on ME oil at this time. Show one quote where I say I dont care about Saudi war crimes. You are arguing with yourself here.
2112 2018-12-04 20:47:11 Hi, it's me. Just here to tell you I'm currently sat on my bed, naked, stroking my legs because they're covered in bath oil and very smooth. 

No one warned me this is what adulthood is.
2113 2018-12-04 20:47:02 Playing for a team run by an oil state? Strange dreams.
2114 2018-12-04 20:47:02 Ultimately what does it matter to us in terms of actually being able to do something in furthering the fight against climate change?  We don't control anything.  We have no resources to fight oil companies and deforestation.  The only thing that matters to us is reparations.
2115 2018-12-04 20:47:00 Telling the truth isn't *attacking*.

You are no better than a member op the GOP.

NO politician should be taking money from the oil/gas industry.
2116 2018-12-04 20:46:50 I honestly don't see why people are so willing to forgive politicians for accepting donations from the oil industry, no matter the amount. The oil industry is killing everyone. There is no room for compromise.

 this bitch more needy than me
2122 2018-12-04 20:46:24 How are you this dense? Oil can move by means other than pipeline which have less chances to spill. I've not, nor has the NDP as a party, advocated for not using oil at all. The auto sector employs a lot of people and can produce green products if supported.
2123 2018-12-04 20:46:17 It’s all liberal politics. Trudeau said from day one they would phase out oil -let’s phase out Trudeau

2129 2018-12-04 20:45:54 Banks - yikes.   Ultimately good news here - less $ for banks = more for economy.  No different than oil
2130 2018-12-04 20:45:49 This thing looks like it's about to take all the oil out of a country
2131 2018-12-04 20:45:28 Solar energy is an option BUT it is wrong that others must subsidise your choice - that still requires mining, oil exploration, heavy transport and makes zero impact on climate.  Your choice doesn't make you a saviour.
2132 2018-12-04 20:45:22 per the data thru Oct. 17, I've got 14 oil and gas folks giving $2,700, and 22 $2,000 and up.

2135 2018-12-04 20:45:13 Crime pays?
2136 2018-12-04 20:45:10 And trust me, I understand that side of it all too well. I'm between a rock and a hard place. I'm for the pipeline, but also against it. The cons did a terrible job of ensuring the future of AB when they were in power. AB should not be solely reliant on oil. It's a bad situation.
2137 2018-12-04 20:45:05 Are you going on a long-distance drive soon? Don't forget to check your oil and properly inflate your tires!
2138 2018-12-04 20:45:04 And of course, you will evade all responsibility when the UK is in the direst of straits. You are the number ONE snake oil salesmen.

2141 2018-12-04 20:44:57 David Sirota misrepresenting Open Secrets to imply Beto is in the pocket of big oil
2142 2018-12-04 20:44:54 So Beto owes individual executives of oil companies that maxed out their donations rather than the companies themselves? #Beto2020? #Democrats
2143 2018-12-04 20:44:54 Started the habit of steaming veggies and adding olive oil & spices. Yum! And it gives me good vibes :)
2144 2018-12-04 20:44:53 I don’t think that this is an attack as much as it is a fact. Do we want to be the party of big oil or do want to be the party of green energy? We cannot have it both ways.
2145 2018-12-04 20:44:26 Once again, not just “people who live in Texas” but oil and gas executives from Texas who have vested interest in oil exploration.
2146 2018-12-04 20:44:21 If you don’t think a Saudi Arabian embargo of oil won’t hurt oil prices you’re insane. Not to mention they are now buying or planes. This will cripple key areas of our economy. Don’t be naive.
2147 2018-12-04 20:44:20 And don't justify it under being paid to have an opinion, be frank, it's clickbait for an unknown hack. Urban moves the needle, you're an unknown & you grabbed coattails, period. Would Rece talk like that? Joel Klatt? No they wouldn't. Snake oil salesman
2148 2018-12-04 20:44:07 I usually eat them with skin and bones; think it’s a personal preference. Bones add some calcium and won’t choke you like larger fish bones will. I prefer the ones in olive oil, but again, it’s a personal preference. Very much a YMMV thing.

2152 2018-12-04 20:43:59 First day GHWB in Vale said it was none of our business how Iraq collected Kuwaiti $80 billion debt. Next day Mangy Thatcher threatened to call him a WIMP for not defending Kuwait, a principality created by Britain only as the queen's private oil stash.
2153 2018-12-04 20:43:55 Onions are for white yam and oil not noodles

2155 2018-12-04 20:43:46 One party denies climate change exists, the other party acknowledges it but continues to accept money from big oil and promoting the “all of the above” policies that condoned a huge surge in oil and gas extraction. Both parties are speeding up climate change. #GreenNewDeal
2156 2018-12-04 20:43:45 I’m sue that’s the decision of Dumb Donald.  Yes stop progress promote oil.
2157 2018-12-04 20:43:40 So you’ll be having barrels of oil for dinner? Good fucking luck, guy
2158 2018-12-04 20:43:32 In 2016 global oil demand according to sectors : 1. Road transport 50% 2.Industry 28% 3.Power 5% and 4.Others 17% .. . Electric mobility will make S.Arabia, Russia ,Iran and Venezuela less important..
2159 2018-12-04 20:43:32 so should i use Vitamin E Oil on my face to get rid of my acne scars or is that bad
2160 2018-12-04 20:43:26 "Some". Whoopdedoo. So in other words - your virtuous electric car isn't actually the magic bullet. Being positive hasn't stopped rainforests the size of small countries being wiped out for palm oil in the space of a few months, so that hasn't worked out too well either.
2161 2018-12-04 20:43:21 Oil change + full tank = different ride 
2162 2018-12-04 20:43:17 I use the creme of nature honey line shampoo and conditioner, Sheamoisture JBOC leave-in, and coconut oil and just a regular soft/medium brush and a silk durag  oh and the clear ecostyler to lay my edges
2163 2018-12-04 20:43:16 for B.C. especially if we've spill or ruptured pipeline during forest fire season. Whales need protection from greedy oil barons. Whales are already starving:can't handle tanker traffic we already have.
N.D.P. would've done better job in protecting interests of workers in Canada.
2164 2018-12-04 20:43:11 Yep, no doubt the brand ‘purpose’ was key to the brief. Will shoppers reappraise the brand and do their Xmas shopping at Iceland because of the stance on palm oil? Or will it be “Nah, Tesco/Asda/Aldi’s cheaper and more convenient”?

2168 2018-12-04 20:42:33 I´m not afraid of the market going down a bit more. News come and go. Stochastics travel from high to low levels and vice versa.  A  few cyclical effects sometimes can be used for rebalancing (e.g. goldmines vs defensive consumer stocks vs HighTech vs oil). Nothing new on WallStr

2174 2018-12-04 20:42:09 Wow you really need to be right about this don’t you. Sorry. Not buying your snake oil, friend. The oil+gas industry is a massive employer of the middle class in Texas, full stop. All those employees who contributed at least $200 are included in the infographic, full stop.
2175 2018-12-04 20:42:07 It is $45-$55 for oil change and tire rotation 
2176 2018-12-04 20:42:07 What oil is good for ur hair? Tryna be more healthy. Anything for men?
2177 2018-12-04 20:41:59 never in my life thought I'd be a low key olive oil connoisseur but yet here I am 
2178 2018-12-04 20:41:50 Macrone's government will fall...and stop blaming the revolution on gas and oil taxes. Oil has fallen 30% per barrel. The French, English,German and Swedish people want TO MAKE THEIR COUNTRIES GREAT AGAIN. Your Mockingbird media days are numbered.
2179 2018-12-04 20:41:34 Do it! Snake oil peddlers like Goop undermine honest efforts to bring information to consumers. The void is being filled by goat yoga and food documentaries on Netflix.

2181 2018-12-04 20:41:29 You've accepted the snake oil from all establishment bankers and warmongering postmodern imperialists, who created the EU to steal assets from poorer countries to feed western greed, and allowed corporate lobbyists to bribe them to overlook environmentally harmful practices.
2182 2018-12-04 20:41:26 Climate change deniers I know believe "it's all in God's hands" Maybe my circle of (R) friends too small as almost all are of religious conservative variety & admitting climate change is real would mean conceding that point
& as long as Big Oil runs GOP, they will not change tune

2186 2018-12-04 20:41:17 Shipping crude by rail poses more of an environmental risk than the pipeline does. Stepping away from big oil is something that needs to be done, but it cannot be done over night. The country has to work together to tackle the problem, not turn their backs and leave AB stranded.

Ndakasaririra kani.

Sometimes,I can't relate. 

The idea of queuing up for cooking oil in 2018 flummoxed me. 

I am not a snob either.

While,I empathise I am not used to low level stuff and cheap politicking hence I switch off to Zim at times.
2193 2018-12-04 20:40:54 Then why are you blaming the current government if they got into this province when oil internationally went down to 30 bucks ! So the same argument could be used
2194 2018-12-04 20:40:53 And who owns the oil companies?  Middle class Americans in 401Ks, pension funds, endowments.    So you take from the oil companies you take from middle class retirement
2195 2018-12-04 20:40:49 The point isn’t that the wealthy donated to the Beto campaign, it’s that he received many donations from oil and gas executives and also had some extremely problematic views about increasing oil extraction.
2196 2018-12-04 20:40:43 I like a fry of the chorizo beforehand to get some of that sweet sweet oil in the pan, then bianco method, with chorizo/peppers/etc added again at the end.
2197 2018-12-04 20:40:15 Essential oils have a small molecular size and  are quickly absorbed. When you apply an essential oil topically, it’s in all the body’s cells within 15-20 minutes, helping the body maintain optimal health at the cellular level!

2201 2018-12-04 20:39:41 I mean. If I didn’t go to Arkansas. I would still get my oil changes at the greased Pig.

2203 2018-12-04 20:39:36 This is NOT true at all - “fries” dont HAVE to be “fried” in oil and they can be cooked a variety of different ways. Its a potato. The only thing unhealthy about a potato is what you put on top.
2204 2018-12-04 20:39:33 I agree with you. 
Everybody has to get this one point: What does the @GOP actually stand for. Realize that their stances on issues are DRIVEN soley by the DM contributors
Examples:
1. Environment- all oil
2.  Guns
3. Vouchers
4. Private prisons

2210 2018-12-04 20:39:05 Likely scenario for the Bank of Canada tomorrow: nod in the direction of lower #oil prices coupled with maintenance of tightening bias, although perhaps in an attenuated form. Gives them an opportunity to kick the issue to the next MPR in January.

2214 2018-12-04 20:38:42 He did everything in his power to stop oil production in this country. He would not allow the pipeline to be built. Nor he wants to take credit for what President Trump has done.

2227 2018-12-04 20:37:37 We could take advantage of our oil surplus and make a stand, draw a red line, on human rights.
2228 2018-12-04 20:37:33 I think it is a vicious cycle. It is oil companies in government that cause both oligopoly and climate change. Even in totalitarian regimes, it is the oil companies pulling the strings. It is because of oil company propaganda that we fear the gentle change of disbanding an oil co

2230 2018-12-04 20:37:24 Sounds like it needs oil.
2231 2018-12-04 20:37:16 True. The point is that Beto has some problematic ties to the oil and gas industry, given the crisis of climate change.
2232 2018-12-04 20:36:54 Sadly the people won't know they have it until they eat it which is too little too late like this recall announcement America knows exactly what it's doing. The FDA should be charged with corporate terrorism along with BIG PHARMA BIG OIL & BIG TOBACCO

I should drink oil to fix my pH balance.
2262 2018-12-04 20:33:48 Can you ask someone from the liberal party Why do we still buy their oil and not oil from Alberta. Why can Quebec block energy east
2263 2018-12-04 20:33:40 Finally the voice of sanity! Cost-effective technology to extract light oil (and gas) from tight, shaley, clastic rocks killed bitumen demand, not Trudeau or EIA’s or lack of pipelines.
2264 2018-12-04 20:33:35 Getting baby oil out of Armani pants will be a bastard!
2265 2018-12-04 20:33:34 I don’t have the knowledge to argue with you all I know is Tories can’t wait to leave .. I can’t help but think that’s because it will profit them and their snake oil salesmen pals.. and that makes me very uneasy 
2266 2018-12-04 20:33:28 Cheers bud, think I'll be needing vnew shockers in the knees and a rebore on the pelvis area possibly a decoke n new oil, soon be flying down pit lane 
2267 2018-12-04 20:33:27 Thanks man! I hope they'll both go well. If I have trouble with Tyson, maybe I can find someone to oil up and hit the gym with me, so I can train properly...?
2268 2018-12-04 20:33:24 Start with Mink Oil!
2269 2018-12-04 20:33:20 How did the @BBC get early supplies of stockpiled cannabis oil? Spinning, spinning, spinning. No improvement yet.
2270 2018-12-04 20:33:19 Normally a rapeseed oil fan myself but (surprise surprise) I was using the deep fryer and got destroyed haha
2271 2018-12-04 20:33:11 So I went to the dealership for an oil change because I get 6 oil changes for free and the dude was like “oh this is oil change 5 out of 6”... bro this is like my 7th oil change but I’ll take it 
2272 2018-12-04 20:33:07 Ohhh all of a sudden in an election year your pro oil!
Funny thing is your stupid Carbon tax and run away spending has driven our province into the ground!
#voteoutthendp2019
2273 2018-12-04 20:33:04 A guy laughed at me because I didn't know the difference between a Philly and a mustang. Cool out cowboy I got oil on my hands not horse shit.
2274 2018-12-04 20:33:02 Darn right! Throw in some sesame seeds and sesame oil and you have the food of the gods.
2275 2018-12-04 20:32:57 Lickspittle Perry has always been a tool for "Big Oil" - now we can add International Trump Stooge to his resume
2276 2018-12-04 20:32:53 olive oil is the lubricant of the mediterranean
2277 2018-12-04 20:32:50 Вряд ли. У меня мама на 1 см выше меня, а отец ниже (не знаю насколько). И единственный кто в семье нормального роста – дедушка по маминой линии. А я в отца пошла((
2278 2018-12-04 20:32:47 Despite low oil prices and instability caused by constant threats from Drumpf, Trudeau has managed Canada's economy well.
2279 2018-12-04 20:32:44 You can see this here in Colorado where Jared Polis campaigned against prop 119 which significantly limited where you could drill for oil or gas in this state. I doubt he'd've had quite the fervor in condemning that if he'd gotten no contributions from oil and gas.
2280 2018-12-04 20:32:42 I thought you’d be an olive oil person
2281 2018-12-04 20:32:40 come back when you have aggie oil money
2282 2018-12-04 20:32:39 Ok does grapeseed oil dry weirdly quickly and cleanly or something because I had a full little pot in my bag this morning and now the pot is EMPTY yet nothing in my bag has oil on it and the bag is dry
2283 2018-12-04 20:32:38 He shouldn't just condemn them. He should take active steps to end all oil production. And he won't so long as he keeps getting donations like that. No politician will so long as they keep getting donations like that.
2284 2018-12-04 20:32:35 #CCUS Why asking public subsidies? Oil & gas and/or utilities using coal or gas power plants shall pay the bill alone and assume environmental potential risks (earthquake and other geological risks). They claim (like @IEA ) that is a wonderful tech then no risks for them, no?
2285 2018-12-04 20:32:34 ....you poor man. Here have some oil to make you feel better.
2286 2018-12-04 20:32:30 Deep frying food in oil (fat) is practically 0% healthy. What would happen if we removed ALL fried foods in America bc it literally kills millions every year?
2287 2018-12-04 20:32:28 I'm shocked! Shocked, I tell you! That a candidate from Texas - Texas! - would have individual people donate to his campaign that work for oil/gas companies! SHOCKING! Because most people in Texas are employed by . . . oh, wait.
2288 2018-12-04 20:32:27 The "oil" huh???
2289 2018-12-04 20:32:24 Further environmental degradation i guess....in the search n production of oil. Why do climate change conference n innovate in the opposite direction?
2290 2018-12-04 20:31:59 Got alpha, krill oil, key minerals, active b, and new mood for the night
2291 2018-12-04 20:31:59 Yea I'd father be extra virgin like the olive oil
2292 2018-12-04 20:31:51 They stink and they use a lot of oil. They're a pain to clean up and filtering the oil is annoying.
2293 2018-12-04 20:31:50 Madam, let's accept your argument that president Buhari is deaf and dumb. His vice is energetic and going from door to door. You're still here, like the elections is on Twitter always complaining. Yoruba adage says if you don't eat yam because of oil, you eat oil because of yam
2294 2018-12-04 20:31:35 “So you need a air filter & a windshield wiper” actually all I needed today was an oil change, thank you!
2295 2018-12-04 20:31:31 フレンドなろ！！！
2296 2018-12-04 20:31:23 y ahora que hacemos @ManuelaCarmena @isabanes @InesArrimadas 
quienes son los demonios ?
quizas en vez de tanto coche y cocha deveriaís de mirar las calderas y calderos de carbón y carbona y de gas oíl y gas oíla
2297 2018-12-04 20:31:22 That’s not a surprise. If they didn’t take money from big oil and opposed the bil, that would be a surprise. Corrupt are always going to keep on being corrupt.
2298 2018-12-04 20:31:18 It was from individual contributors.  Beto didn't take PAC money.  But as gas/oil is a huge employer in Texas, the individual donors list was always going to be heavy with their contributions.
2299 2018-12-04 20:31:18 Was trying to put peppermint oil in my oil burner to help with my headache and I dropped the bottle and spilled that shit all over my clothes, the smell is so strong now my headache is worse #spoonieproblems #spoonielife #cantwinforlosing #atleastismellgood
2300 2018-12-04 20:31:05 What's your explanation for oil/gas CEOS donating to Cruz, but lower level workers donating to Beto.

Oh wait, I know, they told their workers to donate to Beto in case he wins, right? Thats your conspiracy theory.
2301 2018-12-04 20:30:56 An over reliance on oil and gas as an energy source is putting everyone at risk - but sure talk only about yourself and what you need, and sod everyone else
2302 2018-12-04 20:30:54 Maybe they will release a civilian one to the medevac or oil rig community.
2303 2018-12-04 20:30:49 I suppose KFC's new chips are ok if you like the taste of dirty cooking oil.
2304 2018-12-04 20:30:48 How on earth can I get vegetable oil out of clothes? One of my favourite jumpers doesn’t want to let go of it’s delicious goodness (the oil, not me)
2305 2018-12-04 20:30:43 The argument is how much influence do we give Iran in the ME by removing support for the Saudis, and whether that is the right thing to do. Most Americans dont really care past virtue signalling, and would rather just have cheap oil.
2306 2018-12-04 20:30:42 Send American troops to the Middle East to kill and die for oil?
2307 2018-12-04 20:30:33 Weather and climate are not the same thing. A cold wave does NOT mean there's no global warming!! Didn't they teach you basic science in school? Are you aware that every scientist in the world who's not on oil industry payroll thinks you're an idiot?

2309 2018-12-04 20:30:25 The governments have killed millions of Muslims for oil. Islamic terrorist have killed innocent westerners because of a fundamental fairytale. 
No one hates Muslims people hate the teachings of Islam and it’s barbaric teachings
2310 2018-12-04 20:30:22 I’m like 3000 miles overdue for an oil change so idk why I was so surprised when the light came on like it was rubbing it in my face or something
2311 2018-12-04 20:30:21 So, no one who works for the oil and gas industry is allowed to contribute? Because that's how it works. When I give, I have to list my employer/industry and it shows up in reporting as such.

2313 2018-12-04 20:30:17 U wud b better spending ur time making sure oil price drops n lower fuel prices r passed onto the general public, helping keep inflation down ..
2314 2018-12-04 20:30:17 I'm not fussy when it comes to #chocolate. Give me a bar or slab of pretty much anything and I'll take it with pleasure. But I must make an exception for Galaxy. There's just something off about it, like a kind of vegetable oil taste that kills any enjoyment for me. #Celebrations

2316 2018-12-04 20:29:52 If you know me IRL, ChapStick Total Hydration tinted lip oil in Midnight Magenta.  I have 5, hit me up if you want one.  Thanks to Target!
2317 2018-12-04 20:29:32 The price of the oil we have been selling HDTV always been dramatically lower than wti or Brent. So a 10 dollar drop on 26 dollars a barrel is a big deal. We sell most of our oil at a discount because its landlocked. That could've been mitigated by energy east and transmountain
2318 2018-12-04 20:29:25 President Trump
Fixing: Crown Prince Selman

Answer easy, Saudi Arabia still buys US goods thwarts Iran & does good.

Use SWIFT
Seize 12 mths Oil revenues.
Deduct proveable SA costs.

2321 2018-12-04 20:28:57 Scotland’s oil falls within Scotland’s maritime borders? That too much for you to grasp ya potato? 
2322 2018-12-04 20:28:49 It smells lovely at the moment but I’m not sure if it’ll still have the smell at Christmas. Apparently there’s an oil you can spray over them to help maintain the warm scents so I may try that! I’m not sure what else I can add to go with them to make a pretty centrepiece  xx
2323 2018-12-04 20:28:46 Snake Oil Salesman
2324 2018-12-04 20:28:35 Are we also going to end subsidized oil?
2325 2018-12-04 20:28:32 Has your president ever paid off a terrorist to the tune of millions? Has he demonized male construction workers? Has he vilified your oil industry? Praised Castro? Brought a terrorist to a state dinner?

@JustinTrudeau has.  Think about that when you start hating on your prez.
2326 2018-12-04 20:28:29 1. It wouldn’t because we produce enough oil to protect against a KSA oil embargo. 2. The KSA would experience a regime change of freedom and democracy
2327 2018-12-04 20:28:07 Lindsey we are not the only Super Power! It's an open agent market!

Russia, China, Pakistan can fill the void left by a strained US relationship with the Saudis!

Weapons, Oil Prices and strategic alliences can be redrawn by the Saudis!

2329 2018-12-04 20:28:02 Trump supporters are not hard to figure out.  Non college educated males and females that struggle socioeconomically as well as, elderly on fixed incomes.  They were sold snake oil and promised money in their pockets.
2330 2018-12-04 20:28:01 And disregard oil leaks that already occur regularly in areas that already transport oil, and the rest of wild life that will be effected.
2331 2018-12-04 20:28:00 Yam and red oil if you know you know
2332 2018-12-04 20:27:55 *is use like rose hip oil, argan, or coconut
2333 2018-12-04 20:27:54 Quite right! And consider the nations that will be relying mainly on coal power to do it: China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Egypt, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Mexico, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Ethiopia . . . and many more with large populations & little domestic oil or gas

2335 2018-12-04 20:27:46 My first comment when hubs said they were anti pipeline was "but everything is wrapped or packaged in plastic and I'm sure they have a bunch of petroleum based products"
They might be anti pipeline but they're pro oil
2336 2018-12-04 20:27:46 I swear when I think oil, I think of you #exxxoticanj2017! That show you put on at the end was so great, I can still picture it!

2338 2018-12-04 20:27:35 I love robotic oil poffins~!
2339 2018-12-04 20:27:26 Saudi Arabia owes its existence to the west for developing something they couldn’t.....oil!
2340 2018-12-04 20:27:25 acaso esperabas otra cosa?
cuando la gente sea capaz de ver que el coche no es el problema sera tarde nos habran jodido a los pringaos de siempre y ellos seguiran calentando sus casas con calderas de carbon y gas oil
pero es mas guay decir a todo que si
2341 2018-12-04 20:27:19 Because electricity is the anomaly. Gas, oil and coal, the other widely used energy sources, fuels, are obviously goods; electricity is only tangible at the microscopic level. It is though defined as goods.
2342 2018-12-04 20:27:09 That could be a part of it. Drink a bit more water and what I would do if used some oil (google it) and put some on your lips every night to try to retain moisture
2343 2018-12-04 20:26:51 Do they sell otter boxes for oil pens, because I just broke my shit smh
2344 2018-12-04 20:26:51 Actually it does because what were talking about is the effective tax. which some companies IE GE as example actually pay nothing or in some cases get paid by the government in the form of massive tax subsidies. Walmart is another tax cheat in that vein as are most oil companies
2345 2018-12-04 20:26:51 Thank you, Joanna. Positive leadership, as ever. Now @theSNP, historically a party of oil, needs to become the party of just, green transition. That’s Scotland’s independent future.
2346 2018-12-04 20:26:44 Borrowed a Wolber Discjet from Keith Lambert shod with Wolber piste tubular, 1 bearing out & sewing machine oil instead of grease. Jolly fast and made a fantastic noise out of the saddle. Won a 10 mile TT for me!
2347 2018-12-04 20:26:42 My tire got destroyed while I was driving to get my oil changed. 
2348 2018-12-04 20:26:29 Fish oil pills have done more for my colon than Align gastroenterologist recommended tablets ever did
2349 2018-12-04 20:26:12 Does nursing have a gender problem? 

2/28 in my Petroleum class were female. Visa-Versa for the nursing, occupational therapy, and radiation technology classes down the hall. Big Oil has a lack of Talent problem, not a gender problem
2350 2018-12-04 20:26:08 self care is rippin the dirt and oil out of ur nose with a strip of duck tape bc you can’t afford pore strips
2351 2018-12-04 20:26:07 Didn't a news article say that it was a constitutional environmental law on the wall blocking dealing with the ecosystem isn't that a violation. we need to work with the president of Mexico to bring jobs for their people not a wall their land has oil somewhere.

2353 2018-12-04 20:26:03 If they give him more vertical and teach him how to dunk, watch out Lebron and NBA for the real competition. Will not even need halftime for Gatorade, maybe just an oil up once in awhile
2354 2018-12-04 20:26:01 We provide oil changes, radiator repairs, and more. Contact us today.
2355 2018-12-04 20:25:48 Also consider the tanker traffic shipping Saudi oil markedly diminishing as we won’t need it any more. Newsflash: Canada produces enough oil to satisfy domestic needs, just can’t get it to Canadian markets!!
2356 2018-12-04 20:25:34 Goldfish crackers are truly the artist’s best friend thanks being delicious and still not getting flavor dust or oil all over my hands I love you @GoldfishSmiles

2358 2018-12-04 20:25:15 And 50 years of bluster has accomplished exacty what? Your empty threats of cutting oil would cause lost revenue and would hurt fellow Albertans. I thought pipelines were Alberta's lifeline? Your vindictive statement is moot. Is this what being conservative means to you? Spite?
2359 2018-12-04 20:25:10 Not needed, our future should be focussed on Olympic medals, space travel and God as the Cosmos. Keep the Republicans resigned and removed. We have clean energy, and education budgets ahead with a real American oil lobby so America can compete again. Death threats not needed.
2360 2018-12-04 20:25:05 Which is nothing...he’s a snake oil salesmen and everything he touches breaks down and falls apart sooner or later,   With him sooner
2361 2018-12-04 20:24:59 To bad for you that you don’t know enough about Norwegian economy and norwegian way of life.
Also how the oil tax and subsidies work.

2370 2018-12-04 20:24:27 Makes sense. I remember the time I rotated my tires and my car no longer needed oil changes.
2371 2018-12-04 20:24:26 I just found out that my country is the biggest user of palm oil.. my country is literally making the orangoutangs extinct im sobbing
2372 2018-12-04 20:24:24 You know what would less our dependence on Saudi oil... renewable energy sources. Get behind @Ocasio2018 and the green package being put together by the House!
2373 2018-12-04 20:24:02 Very Unhealthy

I have an huge section of brushes all categorized into like "animal", "hair", "clothing", "natural", and I use a variety of the preinstalled ones like the pen, the different pencil tools, oil paint, and I mostly use one blur tool but sometimes I switch to blend :3
2383 2018-12-04 20:23:26 So Qatar announced that it would be leaving OPEC, an oil cartel, in order to focus on gas production
2384 2018-12-04 20:23:18 NBC is owned by Comcast & GE who merged oil and gas business with Baker Hughes. Oil & Gas are important to their portfolio.

2388 2018-12-04 20:22:41 Great point, I didn’t even go there in my head. Without garlic and olive oil which I use religiously...I wouldn’t be able to prep anything I cook
2389 2018-12-04 20:22:36 How many barrels of oil did it take to bribe you
2390 2018-12-04 20:22:36 Oh yeah
Its cleanliness
Which is part of Godliness
And keeping nails is unhealthy too
2391 2018-12-04 20:22:35 LOL yeah they tinted my seats with oil like a primer
2392 2018-12-04 20:22:25 Curious how this new stance that oil industry workers are a caste of untouchables fits in with support for Venezuela.
2393 2018-12-04 20:22:19 Yeah, because oil company EMPLOYEES contributed to his campaign.  They're nuts.

Some Bernie supporters seem to think a Democrat is a "sell-out" if he ever even owned stock.

2396 2018-12-04 20:21:55 Yo I’d be mad as hell if that was me like how u gonna exploit my hooptie and do all this for TV and not even gimme a damn oil change 
2397 2018-12-04 20:21:38 Incredibly difficult decision but it was the right one under the circumstances.  We can only sell each barrel of oil once, so we need to get a fair price for it rather than give it away and forfeit the $ forever.
2398 2018-12-04 20:21:36 Yeah pile those dead reporters up like firewood, just keep that oil flowing.

Moral values, GOP-style....
2399 2018-12-04 20:21:30 Healthy tails! There’s two locations in Reno. My sister works there and we use their cbd oil and it works wonders!
2400 2018-12-04 20:21:30 I suspect the tuna used in the Jewish party sandwiches is similar to what one finds in Spain or Italy eg. packed properly in olive oil without a bunch of junk and therefore delicious. I still routinely eat canned tuna in that format. Yum.
2401 2018-12-04 20:21:29 Qatar is the world’s largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, but it produces little oil.
2402 2018-12-04 20:21:23 Oil packed tuna just as good IMO... Though kippers will always be my favourite.

2417 2018-12-04 20:20:08 Oil and Gas workers represent more than over 2% of all Texas employees, yet represented less than 1% of his individual donor contributions. Exxon, his largest Oil and Gas supporter, had employees give half as much money as the University of California did.
2418 2018-12-04 20:20:05 You have to be intentionally misstating this. They employed by oil companies, which makes up a huge part of the workforce in Texas. And this is for the senate race, not “all of congress”.

2422 2018-12-04 20:19:42 Someone should see how many of the senators claiming the crown prince of SA knew about the Muslim brotherhood reporter guys murder. See if they have oil stock. Bet they do. Bet they would love the prices to go back up also.
2423 2018-12-04 20:19:36 Why does everyone get so up in arms about everything essential oils?? I’m 1000% pro medicine but if I just have a cold, what’s wrong with using an oil to help me breathe a little better, or having one that relaxes you at the end of the day?  I don’t understand
2424 2018-12-04 20:19:34 All tariffs of All countries would be great,industrial espionage aside.
Americans are not in the business of shoring-up the economy's of other countries...even playing field+let the best products survive...That's free enterprise. Ayn Rand hated giving away oil extraction tech. 
2425 2018-12-04 20:19:31 This is bullshit. This is entirely based on donations from people employed in the oil & gas industries. Not PAC or corporate donations.
2426 2018-12-04 20:19:28 ok that's all great. but what about the oil and gas donations though. seems bad. I'm bi and I dont want to be dead in 12 years

This garbage from Sirota is exactly why intelligent people can't take leftist pundits seriously.
2430 2018-12-04 20:19:06 No idea what question you’re talking about but I’m happy to answer. And if having an opinion I’m paid to have is selling snake oil, then my entire industry is I guess.

2434 2018-12-04 20:18:51 @suminchoi1 @mccDMTP 
Newtown Creek was a great presentation. Overall you were able to present a strong case of the pollution in the water by showing the oil and residue that was glue and key that brought out my emotion.
2435 2018-12-04 20:18:51 @SatiarShah @alexjauld you know what this regional rivalry stuff reminds me of is my family in Europe who hate people from x town who live 15 minutes away and I laugh my balls off. 
You're exactly the same. 

I have way more disdain for those oil pumping, cowpokes than a NW team
2436 2018-12-04 20:18:50 gonna start comparing my van's oil changes to having a period

he was a little late so he was cranky the entire time but now that hell is over and he is content
2437 2018-12-04 20:18:50 So @theSNP voted with the Tories today for Transferable Tax History in the Finance Bill - £24bn minimum of new tax relief geared to deliver Maximum Economic Recovery of North Sea oil and gas. Their response to @labourlewis climate challenge was utterly incoherent
2438 2018-12-04 20:18:48 realy i do suggest to my country to start to sell oil in exchange of gold. No need for petrodollar anymore.
2439 2018-12-04 20:18:48 Astonishing how many things coconut oil is good for.
2440 2018-12-04 20:18:47 Oil based eye drops, they protect the eye and stay longer.
2441 2018-12-04 20:18:45 SA has weakened economy due to low oil prices & use only European & US weapon systems. SA power brokers know 1 man, MBS, only worth so much.
2442 2018-12-04 20:18:38 fine. where are the tweets about oil? not Sherwen´s. I mean Kazakh´s oil, Bahrain´s oil, UAE´s oil, Russian oligarch´s oil. where in your timeline? where are the tweets about Orica´s mining?

2444 2018-12-04 20:18:37 There are a lot of countries that are willing to buy our oil as well but we can’t get it to a port like Vancouver or east coast to ship it out to other markets than the us. Opening up the market to other buyers would be great for the country
2445 2018-12-04 20:18:35 Our choice of location was very deliberate to avert the risk of fire, which was practically nil in that location.  But the occurrence of one (or a few) terrible accidents is hardly a reason to impugn the entire thing, any more than impugning frying turkeys in peanut oil
2446 2018-12-04 20:18:33 Yeah it’s crazy, I always thought it was the oil industry holding them back through generator sales which lead to more oil consumption but idk anymore
2447 2018-12-04 20:18:32 It is the fact that oil is not renewable and the existing oil industry is having a huge impact on the environment. Do you think that the wild fires in Fort Mac would have been nearly as devastating if not for the deforestation  but no let’s expand and cause more damage
2448 2018-12-04 20:18:25 Someone clearly has never had oil packed tuna, kippers or sardines. Delectable.
2449 2018-12-04 20:18:19 I'd love to gift someone with one. And apply the oil and brush his beard. 
2450 2018-12-04 20:18:19 With global pollution being what it is, ditching the oil sands isn’t going to have a major impact on climate change. 

I think we could continue on without O&G expansion until we’ve made greater headway with renewables - a transition period to build up new energy sources...
2451 2018-12-04 20:18:17 In the context of HBO, Friends is "shit" in the elitist dismissive sense of the word, absolutely. The HBO brand and the "Friends" brand are oil and water. It may seem silly, but the gradual down-market move of the HBO brand will hopefully be managed carefully.
2452 2018-12-04 20:18:14 Gas tax is bad not because of some dumbass need to "support oil and gas" but because civilian car and gas usage barely registers in terms of environmental damage

2457 2018-12-04 20:17:37 YA okay. So We refine what we need and leave the rest in the ground. Trans Mountain says it in there adds, I hear them 30 times a day. "Pipeline expansion does not mean more oil production" So if we are not producing more oil, we keep what we need and move on to another energy.

2460 2018-12-04 20:17:28 David, I'm a big fan and I cite you all the time. I'm a way bigger fan of yours than Beto's, but this is a bad take. There's over 320,000 oil and gas workers in Texas. That's roughly 1.50 per person. Most of them are in Houston and are Dems.
2461 2018-12-04 20:17:23 What's a driveway?
2462 2018-12-04 20:17:23 Also there is a TON of blight in Vacherie owned by plants, oil, and community members.
2463 2018-12-04 20:17:12 Excellent pt!  Workers from the industries that gave to Bernie aren’t destroying our planet, robbing us blind & aren’t underpinning an apartheid state in Israel.

2465 2018-12-04 20:17:09 @KwikKarDenton Charging $100 for a $68 dollar oil change is terrible. "special" filter charge, after you already charged me for the filter? I can't imagine how you get to sleep with such underhanded and disgusting practices. Telling all I know to avoid you like the plague.
2466 2018-12-04 20:17:09 Sirota is attempting to create waves where none exist. Beto pulled in $70 million. He received $429K in donations from Oil/Gas Industry EMPLOYEES - in other words, 0.6% of his donations.

This is literally a garbage, partisan attack from a political hack on the left.
2467 2018-12-04 20:17:06 This is absolutely ridiculous. Over 300K Texans work in the oil industry. In fact, Tx employs 39% of those in oil & gas industry nationwide. That's EXACTLY why individual donations DO matter. If you insist on telling a story don't just tell half of it. Smh.
2468 2018-12-04 20:16:55 Oil

2476 2018-12-04 20:16:19 Oil crepe boot ? 
2477 2018-12-04 20:16:14 If it's for green aims then they can set an upper price with tax and if the oil price rises above that then reduce the tax. That way the hit is to the govt finances and not the economy. That way the price can rise gently and not shock the economy.
2478 2018-12-04 20:16:13 My mom took my car and cleaned the whole thing and got my oil  changed for me #blessed
2479 2018-12-04 20:16:03 Because Canada refines that oil instead of our own. Bc allows that oil to come in by ship but won’t take our own oil by pipeline. Not just bc but the country as a whole. Just easier for me to pick on bc.

2481 2018-12-04 20:15:57 How is the carbon footprint of a barrel of oil produced in Saudi Arabia less than one produced within Canada? How is a pipeline worse than transporting by rail (think Lac Megantic not to mention the fuel burned powering the engines)Your argument breaks down on so many levels...
2482 2018-12-04 20:15:55 Of course Tillerson was corrupt. He was creating reduced EPA rules for his  oil lobby mates, whilst Trump given profit share.
2483 2018-12-04 20:15:55 Hi Stevo,  I meant that the US has an abundance of oil (if what I read is true) so we wouldn’t be impacted by Saudi oil.
2484 2018-12-04 20:15:54 To be fair, oil isn’t exactly a great market. It’s not even economically sustainable without government subsidies, and that was even before Obama’s regulations. Plus, Obama did lift the oil export ban, which caused a large increase in oil production to fit global demand.
2485 2018-12-04 20:15:49 He's the one they should drench in oil!
2486 2018-12-04 20:15:47 The optics of a flippant tweet announcing the disbursement of $50 million.

2491 2018-12-04 20:15:30 I'm just pointing out that renewables are not the solution to reducing our oil dependence on the Middle East. I've not commented on whether imports from S.A. matter, except to say that the price hike from stopping imports is probably overstated.

2521 2018-12-04 20:13:25 "The internal combustion engine, in which light oil fractions were burnt  by means of controlled explosions inside of steel cylinders"
@motomatters , David, to me, you are a gifted men. I love youre writing. I do.
2522 2018-12-04 20:13:24 Oil and gas are killing the planet. Accepting money from people in the industry reduces your incentive to fight that. So, yes, it's perfectly fair to ask this of a politician.
2523 2018-12-04 20:13:18 Damn oil change and wipers and just got me
2524 2018-12-04 20:13:09 @JustinTrudeau Canadian should vote on this instead of you doing on our behalf. We don't want you promising to your overlord while Canadians oil & auto sectors suffers. Please explain why you aren't helping to protect our country from criminals exporting drugs from China?
2525 2018-12-04 20:12:55 You have drunk the Kool Aid my dear and your opinions have no basis in fact. Clearly you believe that supporting unethical, environmentally destructive sources of oil is better than gettin our own product to market?

2527 2018-12-04 20:12:41  Try some coconut oil everyday.
2528 2018-12-04 20:12:34 I need to start hyping CBD oil. That thing has saved my life.
2529 2018-12-04 20:12:28 He is part of oil mafia
2530 2018-12-04 20:12:24 I wanna try CBD oil
2531 2018-12-04 20:12:24 my hand holding is a vial of rose oil spilled on cement
2532 2018-12-04 20:12:19 Oil and gas drillers:  you don't need to produce 10 years of reserves in one year.  I wonder how these CEO's did on the Marshmallow Study when they were younger.
2533 2018-12-04 20:12:18 Yes please and we can keep all our oil.
2534 2018-12-04 20:12:14 Solar and Wind already cheaper than new coal and oil but greater effort needs to be put into #EnergyStorage to allow higher percentages of integration with grid and transportation systems. #VRFB megabatteries now being built could contribute massively to load shifting #duckcurve
2535 2018-12-04 20:12:04 The oil lobby isn’t an honest side. They’ve known about the dangers of CO2 emissions as far back as 1957 with Humble Oil’s research.
2536 2018-12-04 20:11:56 How many people? Literally, how mny drivers, secretaries, foremen, supervisors, parts runners, mechanics, etc work for an oil and gas company, or ones that hold oil & gas subcontracts?
Triggered? Yep. At liars and those who deliberately mislead but call themselves journalists.
2537 2018-12-04 20:11:44 Do you honestly think my donation to Beto is indicative of what my company donated or worked toward or preferred? I am in the oil/gas industry by the way.
2538 2018-12-04 20:11:36 Oh..just some flax seed and olive oil!
2539 2018-12-04 20:11:13 Poisonous Crabs? 

What a great way for San Francisco Libs to justify getting Big Govt to force Big Oil pay for their Big Sea Wall... #CrayCray 
#WhatILearnedToday 
2540 2018-12-04 20:11:07 Quebec will never agree. So, build another bitumen upgrader in Alberta, and a shorter, simpler pipeline from Fort Mac to Churchill. Sea ice can be broken year round by tankers. Displace foreign oil in Saint John and Montreal refineries.
2541 2018-12-04 20:11:05 I don't even have a lamp oil to lose, but i've still decided that im the king!
2542 2018-12-04 20:11:02 I'm tempted to make a simpler apron in oil cloth. 

Might be nice, it can be wiped down instead of going in the washer.
2543 2018-12-04 20:10:54 @Ocasio2018 as an avid supporter of green energy, and alternatives to common place dependancies on oil. You seem ignorant of details on Buffalo .You should read up on the Tesla factory. Its ahead on job creation projections set by the state. 85 percent of which are from w NY.
2544 2018-12-04 20:10:35 I lost a gram of oil at circle last night so merry Christmas 
2545 2018-12-04 20:10:27 My god, I just received @BlackOrchid_BBO's Pumpkin Spice moisturizing oil and I smell like a snack. Can't wait for them to restock it so that I can buy it for friends and family 
2546 2018-12-04 20:10:23 There is no warfare without an oil supply chain.

2548 2018-12-04 20:10:05 Well, Alberta can’t ‘help ourselves’ because we need a federally approved and regulated pipeline to get our resources out of the province at world oil prices. BC has had federal help with soft wood lumber prices. We need the same sort of help to fight BC NDP anti-pipeline work.
2549 2018-12-04 20:10:03 I use tea tree oil, witch hazel, cocoa butter, and I drink lots of water. Works like a charm.
2550 2018-12-04 20:10:02 ん、これ油変えた？あーなるほど、ごま油をひまわり油で割ったのか。
2551 2018-12-04 20:09:54 There is no warfare without an oil supply chain.
Access to oil won WW2.
2552 2018-12-04 20:09:48 I just watched my co worker POUR cbd oil into his mouth I hope he feels better
2553 2018-12-04 20:09:45 i got neem oil for my face n this shit STINKS
2554 2018-12-04 20:09:45 This was always my favorite talking point to fish slap a right wing idiot.   In their world, scientists are greedy little grant seekers who perpetuate climate “myth”, while OIL companies, billion dollar oil companies apparently have no profit motive .. at all
2555 2018-12-04 20:09:45 Another article more about Trump than an accurate anylisis of taxes paid vs resources utilized.  It doesnt matter how much is paid in if you draw out multiples of input. 
There is NO comparison between the two that I see.
2556 2018-12-04 20:09:38 So, the day of freebies continues....lol. In the mail today, I've received Fish oil supplements and a box of probiotics.....lol. WTF? Someone trying to tell me I need this stuff at 55 years old??? lol — feeling entertained
2557 2018-12-04 20:09:18 Whats the latest on Oil Production from Venezuela? like stable 1.2M or trending even lower?
2558 2018-12-04 20:09:14 Which essential oil helps with deductive reasoning and financial success?
2559 2018-12-04 20:09:12 is the greed on the scientist making thousands or the oil exec making millions?
2560 2018-12-04 20:09:11 The secret to soft hands?  Just spill the oil from a jar of peanut butter all over them. 

Next, I'll explore the exfoliating qualities of raspberry jam.
2561 2018-12-04 20:09:09 You just said we refine all we need. If that is true why are we imnporting Saudi Oil?
2562 2018-12-04 20:09:02 Doesn’t anybody feel like I do? Stop selling weapons to other countries. Then we wouldn’t be beholding to the leaders for fear of canceled orders. It’s already bad enough that the middle easterners have manipulated the oil market.
2563 2018-12-04 20:08:57 We took U.S history boo. Explain to me why I wouldn’t point at western colonization? Also why are you assuming that I think imperialism ONLY contributed to pollution? You and I came to the understanding that large corporations, oil and meat companies for example, also contributes
2564 2018-12-04 20:08:57 It’s within Scotland’s maritime borders...making it ours. Listen to yourself man...what is wrong with you? It’s Scotland’s oil. 30 pieces of silver for each of you unionists

2566 2018-12-04 20:08:41 just found out that theres a canadian island with a lighthouse on it that the US claims is theirs and therefore pretends that theres nothing on the island

and the running joke is that this island will be American once they find oil on it
2567 2018-12-04 20:08:36 Wow you really need to be right about this don’t you. Sorry. Not buying your snake oil, friend. The coffee guy doesn’t max out his contribution. Seems like you want to keep oil money in politics. I think that is where your problem begins.
2568 2018-12-04 20:08:25 No. We need to stop using oil. I don’t know how that works either but I know we gotta do it.
2569 2018-12-04 20:08:15 As another Albertan, he blames all Albertas problems on the people for not switching in a super short amount of time to "better" energies. Most of our jobs revolve around the oil industry and not only is he shutting us doen, he forcibly makes us sell it to other provinces (1/2)
2570 2018-12-04 20:08:14 元気してる？
2571 2018-12-04 20:08:12 Did somebody say express oil changes? That's the whole reason we don't accept appointments for our oil changes - we'd be done by the time you set it! Don't waste your time with anyone else next time, Toni! We got you! 
2572 2018-12-04 20:08:08 so hey the last time I took my car to get oil changed they somehow got oil all over my seat. so I let them know and they were so sorry they gave me a full car detail voucher. that's pretty neat!

...it takes 5 hours tho. so that's my day today 
2573 2018-12-04 20:07:58 When will Tillerson's name reappear in this discussion? He wanted sanctions lifted for an oil deal? Bailed with the sanctions weren't lifted. Did he do anything illegal?
2574 2018-12-04 20:07:55 Dried. I usually put them in a jar and mix in a teaspoon or so of virgin olive oil before putting some in the tray.
2575 2018-12-04 20:07:47 I know oil on water is a song about a comedy sex blog but it still makes me sad
2576 2018-12-04 20:07:45 I'm on my way to pick up my Nature's Bounty Hair, Skin, Nails "Argan oil+Biotin softgel pills in my personal mail box at the UPS store #BeRightBack
2577 2018-12-04 20:07:41 That's only because there's an oil glut right now.  Once OPEC slows production down the prices will go back up. Enjoy while you can.
2578 2018-12-04 20:07:32 Meanwhile the big oil / libertarian right in this country is funding HUNDREDS of think tanks.
2579 2018-12-04 20:07:22 You oil him like the baby he is
2580 2018-12-04 20:07:17 Where does electricity come from? Serious question. Don’t electric power plants run primarily on oil? Maybe some run on hydro or nuclear . . . Maybe I’ll google it.
2581 2018-12-04 20:07:14 A military’s purpose is to defend a nation from invaders (ie, protecting the rights of the citizens), while an oil company exists to provide a good to its customers in exchange for money.  The former is a legitimate job of government, the latter is not.
2582 2018-12-04 20:07:02 We also depend on their oil right now. Let’s get out of that predicament
2583 2018-12-04 20:06:59 Candain doller and oil felll rock bottom make every one poooooooooooooooooooor $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ banks our closeing $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ no money make people loose home s $$$$$$$$$ loonie is down $$$
2584 2018-12-04 20:06:58 Beto was representative from his TX district, so has an ethical obligation 2 represent THEIR best interests: that’s what REPRESENTATIVE means.

Being that many of Beto’s constituents work in ‘oil patch’ of TX, what’s good 4 their employers often IS in THEIR best interests, too.
2585 2018-12-04 20:06:58 Came dangerously close to using paint thinner thinking it was cooking oil tell me again why I think I’ll be sound living alone
2586 2018-12-04 20:06:56 due to the shower i am now a mix of smelling like teatree oil/peppermint, cinnamon, and roses and callie is very perplexed by it
2587 2018-12-04 20:06:53 Argan Oil is for the face
2588 2018-12-04 20:06:50 i’ll look at the paper once i go back to pay but the last place i went used to rotate my tires for free :( lol like it came with the oil change. but they closed down smh
2589 2018-12-04 20:06:45 Your being to clever by half.   The oil or refined products need to move across Canada.   That takes pipelines.  And why wouldn’t we want to export?   If you advocate against oil why do you support the auto sector?
2590 2018-12-04 20:06:17 scotland may want out but have you looked at the exports to the uk vs europe exports from scotland
61% to the uk
17% to the EU
23% rest of the world
thats without Gas or Oil that even Nicola Sturgeon has admitted is next to nothing 
still want out???
pay membership to 17% exports
2591 2018-12-04 20:06:14 TFL UPDATE: TfLTrafficNews: A3 Robin Hood Way S/B + south of Robin Hood R'bout (A308) - Reports of a large oil spillage following a road traffic collision.
2592 2018-12-04 20:06:07 I would complain.  I know the guy looks good compared to Trump, but so do most humans.  He just spent 41 billion of our money on an oil pipeline.  #NotWorthy
2593 2018-12-04 20:06:04 WHAT IS THIS SORCERY!?

I've found good tajadas fiendishly hard to re-create at home. I don't know if its oil temp or plantain ripeness or what.

2596 2018-12-04 20:05:49 Another team to thump the oil!!
2597 2018-12-04 20:05:48 well oil stock = tied to oil price.
2598 2018-12-04 20:05:40 One thing though, unlike you I wasn't being facetious. My business is better than ever and the everyday working man must be doing as well as they say because my rental business mostly consists of blue collar workers and people in oil related fields. Its hard to argue with facts.
2599 2018-12-04 20:05:33 They call the sidewalk pavement for some reason...
2600 2018-12-04 20:05:27 While there was a big gas discoveries offshore Israel, there were no  good news lately regarding onshore exploration successes. I'm going to implement and update about comprehensive and accurate exploration effort of finding oil  (or gas) on Land of Israel 
2601 2018-12-04 20:05:22 The problem is that Canada is knowingly importing oil from less ‘green’ sources than its own and preventing our own product from leaving the country due to pipeline preventions.
2602 2018-12-04 20:04:48 Oh I know, I get a hot lather straight razor shave, coconut oil/balm treatment, trim and maintenance thing once a quarter.
2603 2018-12-04 20:04:37 To me it doesn't matter anymore which party won the Presidency because in the end they both going to fuel the war×10 modern it's previous year,War that's oil driven @RT_com @Underground_RT @georgegalloway @Ruptly @redfishstream,hacking,Terrorism,Russia,China gate are war themes..
2604 2018-12-04 20:04:34 Oil executives are directly responsible for global warming. Again, you guys are making a different argument than I am and then saying it's wrong. I don't care about the platform worker. I care about the CFOs.
2605 2018-12-04 20:04:30 Get an opportunity to spray oil in goddess boods
2606 2018-12-04 20:04:22 Good news, indeed. I work in oil & gas & I'm kinda nervous.
2607 2018-12-04 20:04:19 Where can I get bio oil?
2608 2018-12-04 20:04:10 House tongue
2609 2018-12-04 20:04:10 “PUSSY IS EVERYWHERE” but those females that change your oil & tires aren’t.
2610 2018-12-04 20:04:04 No I didn't need to. If you follow the story they are one and the same. So what the hell does this have to do with the oil feild again?
2611 2018-12-04 20:03:34 I may have missed one or two, but I think the Venezuelan oil minister said the word “mañana” at least five times on his arrival to Vienna for the #OPEC meeting | #OOTT #Venezuela

Campari tomato, fresh bufala mozzarella, basil and olive oil
2614 2018-12-04 20:03:08 Then why is fuel more expensive than ever?! At the current oil prices per barrel gas should be closer to $2/gal...instead its $4/gal. @DanRather @VICE @coccodrillo21 @RubenSalazarPBS @frontlinepbs @tedlieu @RepAdamSchiff @RepMaxineWaters @SenKamalaHarris @latimes @TomSteyer
2615 2018-12-04 20:02:58 “Olive oil will wash off fine”, I said. “It’s Tupperware after all”, I said. 
2616 2018-12-04 20:02:57 Its about lining Putins, MSB's and his own pockets with oil money!
2617 2018-12-04 20:02:57 cover me in oil uwu
2618 2018-12-04 20:02:52 Analogy makes perfect sense Sauds are definitely a mafia family with shakedowns and murders ...squandered trillions of pounds on excess .....when oil runs out they will have no industry just desert ...
2619 2018-12-04 20:02:50 Lool someone that's still looking for more palm oil
2620 2018-12-04 20:02:47 Norway: extra taxes on exports/ foreigners  uses thatto invest in services & givesupport to its citizens

Aust: Signs multiple free trade deals  foreigners buy our exports very cheaply  taxpayers lose revenue  faces oil/gas/food shortages OURSELVES #auspol
2621 2018-12-04 20:02:46 Cuz you need your oil changed
2622 2018-12-04 20:02:46 HE RAN IN TEXAS!!!!!!! Expecting him to turn his back on the oil/gas industry is like expecting someone running for Governor of Antarctica to condemn ice. This entire post is pointless.
2623 2018-12-04 20:02:42 Also counters your argument they consume at same rates as natives and thus contribute through taxes on consumption at the same rate as natives. Basic use of services is equal on a per head basis though.
2624 2018-12-04 20:02:39 Crazy list. Yet Koskinen couldn't pull it out for the Oil last night. Thought about riding with CGY tonight with this in mind, but went with CBJ as fave at home.
2625 2018-12-04 20:02:35 A small amount of  Coconut oil when required
2626 2018-12-04 20:02:31 You seem to be discharging a slick fluid between your thighs. Do you require an oil change? I would be happy to assist.
2627 2018-12-04 20:02:30 I've been at @NTB for almost 2 hours waiting for an oil change and a tire rotation. It does absolutely no go to set up an appointment. I'll definitely never be back and I do not recommend anyone to do business with this company. #Terrible #NTB
2628 2018-12-04 20:02:30 oil spill 
2629 2018-12-04 20:02:26 I love everything you post, but any resemblance of Hershey's to actual chocolate is purely coincidental and unintentional. It's like maybe 10% cocoa solids and vegetable oil. It's sweetened brown wax.
2630 2018-12-04 20:02:24 I know some people recommend cocoa butter or coconut oil
2631 2018-12-04 20:02:22 Cute story, I guess that was part of the shell game to avoid answering a simple question or owning your own actions, big shock. Well hopefully your daughters don't end up with a snake oil salesman like daddy and your 15 mins are up
2632 2018-12-04 20:02:15 EWWWW!  WTH?!  I know women bleed for a week without dying but please, it is not analogous to the miracle of the oil. So stop. Just stop you’re corrupt agenda.
2633 2018-12-04 20:02:02 Hmmmm. Where did you get your data? And what percentage of his total donations were from these oil and gas executives?
2634 2018-12-04 20:02:01 Should see sp start to rise up to first target zone this Friday
2635 2018-12-04 20:01:33 Red oil
2636 2018-12-04 20:01:32 Go study Oil and Natural Gas in the middle east, and then come back and tell me about your Ignorance..
2637 2018-12-04 20:01:28 Global warming conspiracy theorists, seem to believe that man is in total control of Earth's climate.
How could anybody believe that?
They want you to pay a carbon tax.
They want you to stop using crude oil, and use batteries, and electricity, which are much more expensive.
2638 2018-12-04 20:01:28 Mia gine find some oil. Don't worry.
2639 2018-12-04 20:01:05 Hell, anyone near the sciences knows that the only way you make real bank doing pure research is to go into business, or work for, I dunno... Big oil?
2640 2018-12-04 20:01:01 I love when people come into the apartment and say “Oh my gosh! It smells so good in here!”... that right there is the combination of my essential oils in the diffuser AND my essential oil cleaner. 

Happens every time 
2641 2018-12-04 20:00:56 IRAQ OIL MINISTER: TOO EARLY TO SAY IF OUTPUT CUT NEEDED
2642 2018-12-04 20:00:38 Are you looking for some #holidaygifts? Consider this fantastic rich lathering #soap with #DeadSeaMud and pure #Eucalyptus essential oil. It’s wonderful at #detoxifying and #cleansing the #skin. You can find the dead sea soap and other great products at your local #SaltSuite.
2643 2018-12-04 20:00:38 Sanctions are the answer. We don't need his oil. We have largest oil reserves in . He needs our weaponry - cut it off. Jared needs his $s, too Damn bad.
2644 2018-12-04 20:00:37 Look man by your own logic Beto O’Rourke is more beholden the the University of Texas than to Exxon Mobile as they gave him substantially more money. He is a politician from Texas, fucking of course he’s going to get piles of oil money. You’re only helping to sow discord. Stop
2645 2018-12-04 20:00:32 Wow. Oil company employees in an oil state actually donate to political candidates?
You get paid for this?

2647 2018-12-04 20:00:26 my noodles are literally swimming in oil
2648 2018-12-04 20:00:24 Your country IS distorted. The rest of the world sees it exactly for what it is. A deeply misogynistic and ignorant state built on oil. Oil ends though. 
2649 2018-12-04 20:00:18 The industry needs fuel cells! Stop burning oil - now please!
2650 2018-12-04 20:00:16 We always laughed in my house growing up when big tobacco, and then big oil, started their "spoiled research scientists" lies. My Dad was exceptional in his field, and it was still an UPGRADE when we got a used Dodge Spirit in '93!
2651 2018-12-04 20:00:11 We make enough oil to avoid that; Arent reliant on SA for our needs specifically. Venezuela ships far more to us. But they do act as counterweight to Iran. Unclear why any of those are in our narrow existential interests.
2652 2018-12-04 20:00:09 Buy #Bitcoin BTC and defund the gov. No more out of control money printing to be spent on subsiding oil, wars, coal fired and nuclear power stations.

2654 2018-12-04 20:00:04 She’s saying they’re cooked separately but then oil mixes inni when filtered inni? I suppose take precaution or ask the individual branches if you’re arsed 
2655 2018-12-04 19:59:57 Well let’s starting working out how to harness it efficiently instead of wasting money Fracking, paying EU money to leave and subsidising the coal, gas and oil industry. If we’d have done it 20 years ago where would we be now!!? Also it would make the EV revolution a no brainer.
2656 2018-12-04 19:59:55 i was reading the press coverage from 1973 oil crisis a while ago & people were writing the same thing about need for more refineries then
2657 2018-12-04 19:59:43 robots may not have cognitive thought or the logic and reasoning of an average adult human, but they can fry stuff and not be fazed or hurt by popping oil, and honestly that'll probably be what they best us with.
2658 2018-12-04 19:59:39 mmm then instead of the cream maybe something more natural like coconut oil or aloe vera gel if that doesn't help maybe consulting a dermatologist would be the best idea
2659 2018-12-04 19:59:39 Only 3.42-percent of @RepChrisStewart's campaign donations come from small, local donors. 95-percent from large donors and PAC funds - mostly oil and gas, defense, lobbyists. Is there any question why he chooses large business over the lives of journalists? He's owned.
2660 2018-12-04 19:59:36 .@JoeBiden #values are pro-TPP, Pro-fracking, Pro-corporations, pro-war for oil, with a dash of sexual harassment. 

He's just a polite, non-racist, Republican.
2661 2018-12-04 19:59:36 Premier Rachel Notley will be scrumming ahead of the afternoon sitting of the House. She and Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe sent a joint letter to Premier Justin Trudeau asking for the oil differential to be put on the agenda of the First Ministers meeting in Montreal on Friday
2662 2018-12-04 19:59:34 You realized that influencers have bn paid to play with your mind
2663 2018-12-04 19:59:26 Maybe now they will stop supporting the snake oil salesman.
2664 2018-12-04 19:59:22 Individual donations from people in that industry.

Yes. That's my point. You have ta be rich to see $2,700 as small enough change to just drop it on a politician. That's not money from some poor oil worker. That's money from an oil executive.
2665 2018-12-04 19:59:18 Gotta take your bf with you next time tbh they wilding. Most I’ll pay is $40 with basic oil and that’s high and they do all fluids/filters.
2666 2018-12-04 19:59:17 @Graffite toca midnight oil aí pelo amor de deus
2667 2018-12-04 19:59:14 I want an oil painting version of this. It should be in a museum.

2669 2018-12-04 19:59:06 oil is the remains of dinosaurs
Plastic is made from oils
Thus plastic dinosaurs are made from real dinosaurs...
2670 2018-12-04 19:59:06 It's a fact that illegal aliens often pool resources like food, housing, transportation more so than natives. It's what allows them to live on low or substandard wages in many cases AND send money out of the country.

2674 2018-12-04 19:58:48 Beto appears to enjoy oil and gas donations, seems shortsighted with pending runaway climate change on the horizon.
2675 2018-12-04 19:58:45 Oil price is now $59 pb.  It was $85 in October.
2676 2018-12-04 19:58:44 Oh and don’t buy anything, like EVER cause all the products were shipping in by semi that used Saudi’s cheap gas and oil.

2678 2018-12-04 19:58:32 Compliance buyouts are a real possibility after 2020 CBA negotiations. I’m hoping that could save the oil haha.
2679 2018-12-04 19:58:26 Getting this oil Changed then I’m going to my granny House 
2680 2018-12-04 19:58:16 So what do you propose Alberta do? What would your administration have done to curtail the low oil price/lack of pipeline dilemma? I am very interested to know.
2681 2018-12-04 19:58:02 always keep it clean! wash your face every morning and night to remove dead skin cells and extra oil. don’t use a harsh soap, for it can irritate your skin. also don’t scrub harshly when cleansing either. gently wash it with a soft towel or your hands. only use the towel once!

2684 2018-12-04 19:57:57 Trillions of dollars of oil? That's not worth anything, now that the civilized world is heading towards true energy sources -the sun, wind and tides, sources your mullahs hate.Or haven't you heard how the OPEC countries expect to be bankrupt within 10 years, unless they quit oil?
2685 2018-12-04 19:57:53 The riots in France are inspiring. In 3 weeks of violent protest the French dropped gas and oil prices. In 80 years of peaceful protest racism still thrives in America. Except protests to become violent when they warrant results.
2686 2018-12-04 19:57:50 "But their oil is sooooo cheap!"

2691 2018-12-04 19:57:27 Dana among others think that all Americans are chosen by god (>5% of earth).  The wealth of the USA is not based entirely on how much oil comes out of Texas. Protraction will lead to implosion.
2692 2018-12-04 19:57:19 He still controls oil.

2695 2018-12-04 19:57:08 No TOO BIG for the cruise ship industry!  OR for inbound shipments of Jet Fuel.  Who is paying these protestors?  Are they bought & paid for by the billionaires that want to buy AB oil cheap and sell high?

2697 2018-12-04 19:56:59 S/o to my sister for lowering my oil change price  

VW doesn’t play when it comes to maintenance @RxBeezy
2698 2018-12-04 19:56:57 Yes, sales are hitting 50% EVs there.

It is a brilliant plan. They have a huge clean grid with hydropower and increasingly onshore & offshore wind. So they power their cars with that and sell their oil to others. They are now very rich.
2699 2018-12-04 19:56:56 Only 8% of our imported oil comes from the  Saudis. Most, over 40% comes from Canada. Maybe Individual 1 should stop pissing off the Canadians.
2700 2018-12-04 19:56:44 Are you one of those people who wait until last minute and your furnace runs out of oil?! Do not forget to sign up for automatic deliveries today!!! #staywarmthiswinter
2701 2018-12-04 19:56:39 He called them "industry campaign cash" when they were personal contributions. North texas has 30,000+ oil and gas employees. 

I guess you don't know any rich people, then

See my next linked tweet to see just how idiotic this all is:
2702 2018-12-04 19:56:36 you see... there are bones in the soil, and rust in the oil
2703 2018-12-04 19:56:29 I don't have a horse yet in the 2020 race but if you look at the oil and gas employees of every strip contributing to Beto O'Rourke that combined with other supporters shows the wide range of appeal he's garnered.
2704 2018-12-04 19:56:11 2017 gray Nissan Altima and I just got an oil change. Don’t come for me 
2705 2018-12-04 19:56:06 Yeah, that's what everybody says and we're still in the same hole. Take out the Gold Card and put a refinery. Never mind relying on someone else who then controls the price of your oil.
2706 2018-12-04 19:55:58 Americans can admit that America went to Iraq for oil and protested it. You can’t admit that you guys attacked Yemen to take out a democratically elected government.
2707 2018-12-04 19:55:54 Hi friends,  congratulations! Does it specifically exclude palm oil without loophole  (=certification)?
2708 2018-12-04 19:55:53 Stop using gas and oil Margie
2709 2018-12-04 19:55:33 Business headline reads:   "Oil prices wait for direction from OPEC"  
2710 2018-12-04 19:55:27 I guess he needs time to figure out why the oil companies didn’t coordinate production with logistics

2715 2018-12-04 19:54:57 I know some swear by CBD oil but it did NOTHING for me but make me gag.  Now it does help my Slobadore with her anxiety to thunderstorms but my son and I NOTHING. I had my mom take my dad to a palliative care clinic after his Dr suggested trading his 15yrs on a fentanyl patch too
2716 2018-12-04 19:54:50 love that its Palm Oil free as determined to be only using these types of products in 2019 #giveaway #Competition #prize #goodluck #12daysofchristmas
2717 2018-12-04 19:54:49 Love Howard's simple, realistic descriptions of the materials of everyday life. Was strangely fascinated by the variety of beans served in each region and whether they were served with vinegar, oil, or salt.
2718 2018-12-04 19:54:46 I very familiar with blockchain. Everything that it touches is automatically snake oil to me until proven otherwise
2719 2018-12-04 19:54:36 Last 3 retweets are a good demonstration of how people manipulate data. @davidsirota (a Bernie Sanders advocate) was using similar tactics to attack Beto O’Rourke, saying he took money from big oil.
2720 2018-12-04 19:54:28 I’m obsessed with satisfying posts... I can’t stop. My fav is like oil spill looking slime and the soap cutting. Not just any cutting it has to be symmetrical and very small and fine.
2721 2018-12-04 19:54:26 Yes, individuals have to reveal their employer and job when they donate. Not surprising that a candidate from Texas would get lots of donations from Texans who work in oil/gas, a major industry in the state.
2722 2018-12-04 19:54:26 I literally can never ever wake the fuck up ive missed my oil change appointment like 1629199182910 times

2724 2018-12-04 19:54:15 BAHAHAHAHA. I paid cash for my vasectomy man. The oil companies are mostly US based and Alberta keeps its oil land locked by not refining it here.
2725 2018-12-04 19:54:11 きっとかわいい
2726 2018-12-04 19:54:10 Because oil is still king

2728 2018-12-04 19:54:03 Krishna invented snake oil.
2729 2018-12-04 19:54:03 The US Robbed México billions of dollars stealing oil from my contrie without paying taxes, but invested a lot in guns to keep the revolution active.   You were responsible of the murder of at léase two presidents....and you da speaking about justice, ridicule
2730 2018-12-04 19:53:35 What you're claiming is that somehow illegal aliens defy this statistical fact which nobody denies. Additionally this is the fundamental argument for making rich ppl pay more, poorer ppl simply cant and dont pull their weight
2731 2018-12-04 19:53:32 Dont overwash 
-Over washing makes your skin produce more oil. Just wash and if your face still seems oily try an astringent AFTER cleansing.
2732 2018-12-04 19:53:27 Nothing more satisfying that steaming your head in a basin of olbas oil. And getting a good blow of your hooter  it’s the simple things #ahhhhhhicanbreath #coldssuck

2743 2018-12-04 19:52:40 Polite notice people who buy hemp oil remember its different & cheaper to CBD OIL & no where near as good 
2744 2018-12-04 19:52:37 With the current Alberta oil market climate, I keep seeing references to the 80’s. If the same, is it the 80’s of Flock of Seagulls or hair bands? Both are serious style committments you don’t want to get wrong. 

Hope it’s neither. ‘81-‘83 was a bloodbath.
2745 2018-12-04 19:52:34 They'll subsidize oil companies (with OUR tax money) but not alternative energy for OUR future. THIS is the problem. OUR money not being spent on us, syphoned off, given to billionaires who support elections of @GOP
2746 2018-12-04 19:52:32 How could anyone harm such a beautiful creature. Poachers and 
Palm oil industry have no conscience. Humans owe respect and protection to all creatures.  Earth is to share we do not own it.

2751 2018-12-04 19:51:57 The economic growth and development of Nigeria since the advent of crude oil had been on a downward trend, not even under this regime alone. I grew up to spend kobo. When I was young, with 5k I bought good bread, beans and a bottle of Coke in my school.
2752 2018-12-04 19:51:53 Also, I don't criticize him for losing. I criticize him for his positions (such his awful position on Israel) and for his acceptance of oil money, but not for losing. He did remarkably well for a Democrat in Texas.

2758 2018-12-04 19:51:35 Yeah, you chaps ain't seen nothing yet?  Watch the  Sussex Weald and the oil discovery just short of Gatwick Airport.  It's blowing like a good un and much more to be had
2759 2018-12-04 19:51:34 Indeed.  @Khamenei prize is  Mecca, Medina + billions barrels of oil. First he has to destroy Israel to achieve his goal. Sad.
2760 2018-12-04 19:51:33 The MSM, the CIA & the Swamp are in the NWO cabal.  They want a war between the Saudis & the U.S. to drive the oil prices to $200 a barrel to create chaos in the world, this how the Rothschildes make $.  The Illuminati's motto..."from chaos arises order" the New World Order.

2764 2018-12-04 19:51:12 Lynda, you are quite correct. Oil and whisky are part of trade and industry, which are matters reserved to Westminster. Therefore, Scotland does not 'own' these (neither does WM, really; they sell licences and reap taxes, but that's another issue).

However, after independence...

This is illogical on its face. 
It's not how much they pay, it's how much do they use. It's a fact lower income Americans use more than they pay

2773 2018-12-04 19:50:32 You have to reveal your job and employer when you donate to a political campaign. All the “data” here mean is that a lot of Texans who donated to Beto work in oil/gas. Not surprising since that is a top industry in Texas.

2786 2018-12-04 19:49:50 This is not just Trump, this is the entire GOP, they want nothing to do with the climate report because because their oil company masters told them not to acknowledge it.
2787 2018-12-04 19:49:48 That's right, deny American companies the tools to become leaders in the energies of the future by clinging to those of the past...  Electric utility lobbys should exert as much pressure as oil and coal
2788 2018-12-04 19:49:45 Presuming being exactly what you did about the size of my stomach? So you dont eat meat or palm oil. What do you eat? Grass? Hemp? You do realise that the more vegetables you eat the more methane you produce therefore the more damage you do to the environment? Hot air. Literally.

2790 2018-12-04 19:49:26 Probably because they are filled with rainforest-destroying palm oil

2792 2018-12-04 19:49:16 We have always had a good relationship with Saudi Arabia.
We buy their oil they buy our weapons and keep tabs on Iran.
They also bring stability to the region. So it’s a win win for us and them as well.

2798 2018-12-04 19:48:28 I don't completely disagree with your points, but a large part of this can be attributed Trump's rollback on EPA gas mileage standards, and low oil prices, which are making smaller cars built in the US less competitive, and driving sales of less efficient-larger cars.
2799 2018-12-04 19:48:24 Oil futures end with a modest gain as traders continue to weigh talk of output cut
2800 2018-12-04 19:48:13 Why did an oil executive donate $2,700 to Beto? That's honestly a lot of money. I don't think I've ever had that much in the bank. So it does raise questions.

2803 2018-12-04 19:48:05 Words matter. "Exploration" is a warm and fuzzy propaganda term used by the oil industry to conceal the massively damage done by the process of locating oil extraction sites. Best not to use the industry's own well-chosen terminology.

Does that mean I sold my soul for green from a fossil fuel industry.
No.

2825 2018-12-04 19:46:32 Agree with you Jeff...people forget that just over a decade ago the USA only produced 5.5 mbpd.   Now it’s 11.5.  There goes the never ending appetite for cdn oil.  This started with natural gas, now oil.  Fracking was a game changer. Refine in CDN is a start

2832 2018-12-04 19:46:09 That’s BS on the dealership part.  Any licensed garage or oil change shop can do it.  Just keep your receipt and your manufactures warranty is OK.  They just want to over charge you.  They don’t provide the warranty, the maker does.
2833 2018-12-04 19:46:09 I didn't know who Sirota was when I saw his tweet then I found out. He is VERY purposely trying make it look like Beto took money from 'big oil' when  it was from ind. contributors. Ask him why, see if he has any answer besides he wants Bern 2020 and Beto is cutting into that.
2834 2018-12-04 19:46:05 but there can be a kind of 'minimum' price when you're buying from seller with bargaining power. You could interpret AOCs tweet as highlighting that the labour market without unions lacks bargaining power vs employers. whereas, if you want to buy oil from the Saudis....well
2835 2018-12-04 19:46:02 Mr. President, topical is Hanukkah reality that they had a shortage of oil;  but there is a paradox: how did they have wealth to fight a war; rebuild the 2nd Temple; and have no oil for the lamp? Oil=liquidity! We are in that trap now sir; you need to get Krugman to table!
2836 2018-12-04 19:45:58 @JewishChron instead of letting the Arabs promote their Jewish conspiracy they ought to focus on the big oil, which controls big pharma &your doctor's and the Arab right wing morality promoted under the false pretenses of right wing Christian

2842 2018-12-04 19:45:32 He said "oil/gas industry campaign cash" which implies corporate PAC money. Beto took small individual donations (max 2700 for the general). A secretary or janitor who works for an oil company not allowed to donate to a campaign?
2843 2018-12-04 19:45:30 BAHAHAHA. You don't read well. I was talking about the Opioid epidemic and Chinese gangsters in Vancouver. HAHAHA I never bad mouthed the oil industry once. This is so great. I know what the OIlfield funds and it does not give money to the RCMP to fight Chinese gangsters.
2844 2018-12-04 19:45:26 Texas has a ton of people working in the oil & gas industry. It makes sense that some of them are Democrats who donated to democratic candidates including Beto.

To me it sounds like Trump's argument that if everybody on Mueller's team isn't a trump supporter then they're biased.

2879 2018-12-04 19:42:41 That's individual donations. Maybe you're aware that Texas is one of the biggest oil and gas states in the nation and as such has a huge working population there of people trying to make a living even if they aren't for those industries. Fuck out of here.

2918 2018-12-04 19:39:14 I bet your mother did not tell all: how about: motor oil every 20k km, spark plugs all 50k km, muffler all 100k, Brakepads all 50k, brake discs all 100k, ok with a Tesla you also need brakepads all 160k to 320k km. You realy shold male a testdrive and mak up your own mind.
2919 2018-12-04 19:39:10 Anyone that can stand side by side with the snake oil salesman Blair should hang their head in shame
2920 2018-12-04 19:39:09 I don't think so either. 
Also hope if he did he wouldn't be stupid enough to go to that shit show just because he is seduced by Rodgers arm talent.
I think they'd be oil and water and Josh would fail miserably.
2921 2018-12-04 19:39:06 @RachelNotley "Government of Alberta" Transmountain Pipeline TV advertisements were being played during Monday Night Football.

My question, since when is it the governments job to advertise on behalf of oil companies in Canada?  

Why is taxpayer money being misappropriated?
2922 2018-12-04 19:39:03 Except for the things you want. Oil government kickbacks. Corporate welfare. Monopolies.  The list goes on.
2923 2018-12-04 19:38:58 No one seems to complain about the subsidies and tax breaks oil/gas/coal get but yeah, lets stop encouraging renewable s because these rich assholes might not make as much money anymore? Boo Hoo, They should have saved some, dumasses!

2925 2018-12-04 19:38:56 The way my CGPA is going down, it will soon discover oil
2926 2018-12-04 19:38:56 What does Saudi Arabia have that anyone wants to buy? Except oil, of course, which we can easily do without. We only get about 11% from the Saudis.
2927 2018-12-04 19:38:56 I am so sick of the Middle Easts' never ending problems.Stop getting our oil from there.There is so much oil here and in South and Central America it's mind boggling. So much wealth would be generated it might cause a reverse migration. Still work on clean energy obviously.
2928 2018-12-04 19:38:55 @KellyCutrara real Xmas trees r more environmentally friendly than fake ones. How much water/oil was needed to make fake tree? How many times does it actually get reused? Trees require little attention while growing. Rotting wood provides habitat for fungi which are needed for..
2929 2018-12-04 19:38:55 Wow, so you cant have a sensible conversation without insinuating I am fat! What a lovely person you are with your forced opinions. Most vegan food contains palm oil. Are you happy to eat a product that kills animals through deforestation? Swings and roundabouts.
2930 2018-12-04 19:38:44 Ya we’ll it is to trump apparently.
Amazing you get 40% of you’re oil from Canada, and 9% from Saudi.
Trump loves that Saudi oil.
2931 2018-12-04 19:38:35 Ghana is blessed with Gold, oil, diamond and shatter wale
2932 2018-12-04 19:38:30 yeah the oil prices is just an easy way to rile up support, it distracts from real issues which is pity, frezzing fuel prices does nothing for ppl really but they will buy it
2933 2018-12-04 19:38:16 Ameeen
2934 2018-12-04 19:38:12 Addressing the philosophical roots of blatant climate lies (in addition to obvious big oil funding) would help everyone understand and decide (consciously) which philosophy they want and/or don’t want guiding their lives.

2937 2018-12-04 19:38:11 Yes is so cheap then why gas prices are so high? Also your oil addiction is killing the planet and our food chain, the panels are always producing power no need for refiment or pollution
2938 2018-12-04 19:38:09 No. Sorry. If you want to be our ally you cannot murder people that criticize you without a price. We don’t need their oil.
2939 2018-12-04 19:38:08 Scotland doesn’t own the oil. The oil companies do!! Are you thick?

2943 2018-12-04 19:37:49 Why is taking my car to get an oil change such a struggle 
2944 2018-12-04 19:37:48 The carnage in US retail stocks is especially striking given 1) lower oil prices frees up more money for consumer to spend 2) truce of tariffs lowers cost of imported consumer goods 3) employment and income gains are solid, 4) it is not very interest sensitive
2945 2018-12-04 19:37:34 #WCS oil now trading at $27.95 per barrel.  Was at $11.56 last Thursday.
2946 2018-12-04 19:37:32 Wonder how many more oil field workers will lose their jobs because of this. Less production means tighter plant budgets and less employees. Might be unemployed this winter I guess 
2947 2018-12-04 19:37:31 Unfortunately, I’m not optimistic. The oil industry has a long history of massive layoffs when subsidized by the public to retain profits. #ableg
2948 2018-12-04 19:37:28 Maybe you've never been to rural BC.  People grow cannabis everywhere.  I'd be afraid of running into some BM growers as you plant your male clones.  Hey do you know any producers of indoor olive oil or wine?  I get lots of tomatoes from greenhouses tho...

2950 2018-12-04 19:37:00 Well, look at that. @larry_kudlow wants to end Obama-era subsidies because “we are a free market”. When are you ending farm subsidies? Oil subsidies? Financial subsidies? Transportation subsidies? 

Or is our country only a selective free market?
2951 2018-12-04 19:36:59 Promoting candidates who are beholden to the oil industry is more dangerous to the Dems than pointing it out could ever be
2952 2018-12-04 19:36:56 lmao CBD doesn’t contain any THC. just an oil extracted
2953 2018-12-04 19:36:51 Wild growth oil is sooo strong
2954 2018-12-04 19:36:44 Shocking fact...China spends more on semiconductor chips than oil each year. The list of the top 15 semiconductor companies globally by sales not one is Chinese. The trade war is really around this soft spot for China!
2955 2018-12-04 19:36:41 sniff snorf ah yes i love the smell of oil and machines
2956 2018-12-04 19:36:39 My dad’s the best. He’s taking my car for an oil change because I’m swamped 
2957 2018-12-04 19:36:36 I love the seasonal inclusiveness: miracle barns, magic oil, and a dose of reality.
2958 2018-12-04 19:36:34 It was Grapeseed Oil Masa. So just lots of grapes.
2959 2018-12-04 19:36:24 bread + olive oil and 3 glasses of wine = great copping mechanisms.. i feel so at peace w life lol
2960 2018-12-04 19:36:23 I’ve used coconut oil in my hair but i wanna find more options to see what suits me well.
2961 2018-12-04 19:36:22 Chillsville. Hope my oil lasts til after Christmas. Always a juggling act. #randomthought
2962 2018-12-04 19:36:19 U asked for nothing? U just stated that our leaders put money before people with no real facts to back. All the while bad mouthing the energy industry which funds more programs than you care to admit. I haven’t seen any ‘oil love’ from you in a long time bro.
2963 2018-12-04 19:36:17 Oil bottomed out. Oil prices bounced after it bottomed. The planned cap to the equivalent of one oil tanker did not change the price of oil. This is ridiculous.
2964 2018-12-04 19:36:17 If a family succeeds in receiving 50% of Nigeria's Oil revenue for 10years, such a family would become a world on it's own.
2965 2018-12-04 19:36:14 You heard it here first folks, facts about oil companies paying for Beto O'Rourke are now "nonsense". Sounds like some Kellyanne-style alternative thinking has gotten to your head @neeratanden.
2966 2018-12-04 19:36:12 I was recently at a food convention. One of the vendors was a small business selling Olive Oil. It was tasty and I was tempted to buy a bottle, but how could I possibly buy it with confidence? How can I tell it's the real deal?
2967 2018-12-04 19:36:09 The oil from his slick back hair
2968 2018-12-04 19:35:44 I pay that every time I get my oil changed because I use full synthetic and it’s always one quart more of oil than the standard 5
2969 2018-12-04 19:35:44 *coconut oil
2970 2018-12-04 19:35:41 Well, it’s oil, not milk or cheese ... it’s not like it’ll spoil if it isn’t extracted now but left in ground ‘til later when prices are better. #ableg
2971 2018-12-04 19:35:38 I love this oil
2972 2018-12-04 19:35:26 Excuse me, could you specify what this oil is made from?

-Every customer at your olive oil stand.

2974 2018-12-04 19:35:20 Love them. Love oil. Big cars. Love making money. Stack Benjaims. Love guns. Eat meat. Life is good.
2975 2018-12-04 19:35:15 Beto took no corporate cash. This is a lie. Besides as Cruz said Beto is against big oil and therefore wrong for Texas.
2976 2018-12-04 19:35:10 Bernie is the new Nader and fudging it up for Democratic candidates. I don't like him... he's the far left's snake oil salesman.

2979 2018-12-04 19:34:54 Claims we want a “free market” so no subsidies for renewable energy. 

But conveniently makes no mention of ending subsidies for oil and gas companies. 

Hmmm I wonder who is REALLY behind this?? 
2980 2018-12-04 19:34:43 Thank you Senator!  Now we need you to prevent BLM from selling off our public lands here in NM to oil and gas companies.  Protests tomorrow in SF!
2981 2018-12-04 19:34:38 the only renewable that would affect oil is ethanol. And it is not compatible with a large portion of US cars, way too costly to produce(2x that of gas), and harmful to the environment by converting huge portions to corn fields.
2982 2018-12-04 19:34:32 Black castor oil really works
2983 2018-12-04 19:34:30 Asthma patient here. If your chest gets tight, rub some pure eucalyptus oil on it to ease your breathing.
2984 2018-12-04 19:34:29 So, if cooking oil is bad, and so is oil being cooked, cooking oil being cooked is the worst?
2985 2018-12-04 19:34:22 Rejuva Trio up for grabs for only $20 when you purchase a system.

Sale ends Thursday so as me how!
2986 2018-12-04 19:34:16 So does anyone know why the government has kept hemp(specifically CBD oil) illegal for so long, when there's so much research showing tons of medicinal value???...I do...
2987 2018-12-04 19:34:15 Otherwise, wipe down the chain really well with a rag, apply fresh oil, let it sit 5 min, then wipe off the excess. No need to do a fancy de-greasing regularly, in fact it is too harsh. It's hard to get the oil back between the links if it is *too* clean.
2988 2018-12-04 19:34:01 The taxes paid, funding schools would be paid  by homeowners whether they are landlords or owners. Renters pay at an equal rate per value, its just calculated into the rent.

2992 2018-12-04 19:33:40 Wow. Finally some sense coming from the @GOP maybe you can convince your best pal crazy trump that sanctions and strong actions should be taken. Oil isn’t everything. I’m sure trump would enjoy the same power the Saudi prince has though. 
2993 2018-12-04 19:33:32 You'll need another oil change before the update is complete
2994 2018-12-04 19:33:28 I guess the S. Carolina Senator got a little too uppity and needs a gentle reminder of what's at stake... Oh... stocks in oil and smoking bonesaws and such... LMAO
2995 2018-12-04 19:33:20 If you use the water soluble oil paints Bill mentions, you can freely mix them with acrylics!

2999 2018-12-04 19:33:12 Isn’t it just about the oil? Isn’t that why we still suck the Saudi teat?
3000 2018-12-04 19:33:10 Oh yea. I'm hyper anal about the products I use, probably bc I'm a chemical engineer by training. I use Kirk's plain Castile soap for my body, Dr. Bronners Castile soap for hands and face, coconut oil for deodorant. I wear no makeup, lotion, perfume, etc. & use vinegar to clean.

3006 2018-12-04 19:32:47 If we had embarked on renewable energy back in the 70s when OPEC was first formed and placed an oil embargo on the USA we could have avoided most of the BS in the middle east too, but we let the oil and gas folks dictate national energy policy.
3007 2018-12-04 19:32:46 It sounds like the global oil glut is responsible for Canada’s oil industry woes more than the Prime Minister #saudiarabia #tarsands
3008 2018-12-04 19:32:41 I disagree. I'd also like to point out the hypocrisy of the left, that they don't want to make that step between oil & coal to nuclear and natural gas. Nuclear plants have very little waste these days and the output is steam. America can't rely on "sun beam & a breeze" just yet.
3009 2018-12-04 19:32:38 Important and pivotal?

Naw, not so much.

You provide 11% of our imported oil.  That's it.  

Saudi Arabia isn't as important to us as the powers that be would have us believe.
3010 2018-12-04 19:32:34 I want a cold cut everything no tomatoes with oil n vinegar and jalapeño kettle chips
3011 2018-12-04 19:32:30 Yeah, you pointed it out to me when I showed representation of Bernie’s strong stance against oil and gas, where you have shown no evidence of Beto’s stance. I showed Beto’s stance which was weak sauce. Show me what you got?
3012 2018-12-04 19:32:21 I know you need palm oil ginger onion and garlic all minced together and I'll ask about the seasoning
3013 2018-12-04 19:32:19 I meant cooking oil but oil being cooked also sounds terrifying 
3014 2018-12-04 19:32:18 The politics of high salaried professionals in the oil (or most other) industries typically align more closely with owners/upper mgmt than with the proles. Often because bonus and stock options are designed precisely to do so.

3016 2018-12-04 19:32:04 OPEC, the ultimate global cartel! So tempting to trade oil, but I hate futures, mark to market and leveraged trades.
3017 2018-12-04 19:32:02 @tiptree do your Christmas puds contain palm oil? If so is it roundtable certified? I'm trying to source one as too late to make my own.
3018 2018-12-04 19:32:00 That would be true but we get very little oil from the Middle East it comes From the Americas
3019 2018-12-04 19:31:56 Lawd, that Cantu leave in really helped cus maaaaaan my scalp was soaking that other oil up I was dying but that leave in got me right.
3020 2018-12-04 19:31:55 Considering the survival of the species runs directly contrary to the interests of that industry, I don’t think that oil and gas can be written off as just another industry
3021 2018-12-04 19:31:49 Well I'm getting my oil change in the mean time.. since shortly means 5 more hours
3022 2018-12-04 19:31:46 Isn't this just a continuation of Levant's "Ethical Oil" BS from a few years ago? Because we know how unbiased he his... *cough* rebel media *cough*...

3026 2018-12-04 19:30:57 Yes, she’s criticizing the women responsible for marketing the snake oil. But those women are using their positions of power to exploit the trust of their fan base - preying on deeply-ingrained, societal female body insecurities - to further line their already well-lined pockets.
3027 2018-12-04 19:30:53 I am disappointed in you Wlhy I can’t even talk
3028 2018-12-04 19:30:51 I’d like to thank @FirestoneTires for absolutely dogging my claims investigation. 2 months since I made my claim about their team putting the wrong oil in my car I still hv not gotten repayment for the damages nor my time. ABSURD HANDLING OF THIS. Nonetheless, I’m not surprised.
3029 2018-12-04 19:30:47 I agree but as we know the squeaky door gets the oil. In the case with France doors between legitimate citizen and politicians have rusted shut. Sound familiar?
3030 2018-12-04 19:30:46 Thanks again for collapsing the markets. Oil and gold could be plummed more.
3031 2018-12-04 19:30:41 Now that the Senate is in agreement that MSB is responsible for Khashoggi's murder, we can add "accessory to murder after the fact" to the Trump crime pile for letting it slide because oil.  Who had "murder" in Impeachment Bingo?
3032 2018-12-04 19:30:39 Do you mean cooking oil? Or oil that is being cooked
3033 2018-12-04 19:30:31 All with the thought of fashion. I pity alot of ladies that choose fashion to be a part of their lives. Very pitiful!

3042 2018-12-04 19:30:03 Agreed, but also downward harmonization leading into the tragedy, and stronger rules (on approved tankers for volatile oil) foregone in the RCC solution. Lack of another explosion not proof of RCC success.

3047 2018-12-04 19:29:38 Has nothing to do with basic analysis. Schools funded by taxes calculated on property value largely. Removing nonrelivant variables simplifies anylisis arrives at same conclusion. 
Its rational thought and simple math,  there's your proof
3048 2018-12-04 19:29:37 What makes you think that btw? Will we leave NATO, will we have land reform, will we have our own currency, will we follow Norway’s lead and double the tax we take from oil companies, will we simply fall in line behind a US led neo liberal foreign policy? By all accounts no
3049 2018-12-04 19:29:36 Wellness! LOLZ. You mean taking money to shill snake oil.
3050 2018-12-04 19:29:31 Of course these fishermen are now going to work in sail powered vessels and rowboats. I believe climate change is real. I believe oil companies contribute to it. I'm not sure lawsuits by groups that will continue to use the products they are suing about, is any sort of solution.
3051 2018-12-04 19:29:29 Most of that is from individuals within the oil companies as its basis. I'm not taking it on face value though and intend to dig in a bit to see the root of it. It would be good to discount that early if we intend to support him running.
3052 2018-12-04 19:29:24 My new fish oil pills are causing minty burps? 

Better than fishy burps. 
3053 2018-12-04 19:29:22 Could someone Photoshop Beto's head on that Obama "hold oil companies accountable/I <3 BP" cartoon? It would really up the discourse around here.
3054 2018-12-04 19:29:21 Grrr. For some reason, it's not a subsidy when it's oil.
3055 2018-12-04 19:29:18 Glencore's head of oil in Singapore Chin Thean Quek has become the new director of the company's liquefied natural gas (LNG) division after veteran Mark Catton retired at the end of October, sources familiar with the matter said.

3058 2018-12-04 19:29:03 Whenever you hear "Company X has developed a solution that uses blockchain to solve Problem Y" the first question that should come to mind is "Can Y be solved with traditional database and application software?". Blockchain must not become snake oil. #BlockchainEducation
3059 2018-12-04 19:29:02 Right now it seems like the US is using Canada's production as its personal supply management tool.  All discounts for over production are applied Canadian oil.  Another pipeline would allow Canada's production to participate in the world market price more effectively.

3061 2018-12-04 19:28:42 I WORK IN OIL AND GAS AND THEY ARE TRYING TO HUSTLE ONE HELL OF A TAX SCAM. CALL THEIR ASS ON THE CARPET! CALL THEM OUT AND MAKE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THEY CAN GIVE TO THE SCAM BUT NOT THE TAXPAYERS!
3062 2018-12-04 19:28:40 Yes all buisness does that... You dont think the oil industry works with the government to support legislation that makes their buisness better? Welcome to Earth
3063 2018-12-04 19:28:36 Germany's vetting process for migrants is basically non existent.  Psychiatric evaluations on top of the strictest of vetting should be the norm.  Merkel is too busy getting oil from Iran to see what's she's doing to her country.

3067 2018-12-04 19:28:26 I’m a democrat. I voted for Bernie in the primaries. I also live in the energy-plex and work in the oil industry. All this says to me is that Big Oil thought Beto could win.

3070 2018-12-04 19:28:13 Read the thread Bro J Simpson. I did not stat facts. I asked for them. You said the oil industry could help fight Chinse gangsters bringning Fentynal into Canada. How?
3071 2018-12-04 19:28:07 As a matter of FACT, Bush 44 covered that info up and we attacked Iraq instead as not to hurt our "ally"( oil supplier )  and to get control of oil wells to lower the high price of gas at that time. We are part of the problem, we attack based on politics, not on who is guilty.
3072 2018-12-04 19:27:44 Bro as soon I spot da no matter how glowy my expression was, it changes immediately.

3075 2018-12-04 19:27:21 Truly inspiring how many men have drunkenly evangelized the moral necessity of the diva cup to me only to later on accept jobs in the oil industry
3076 2018-12-04 19:27:19 Its quite a challenge. Tomorrow  we are getting the oil changed. Restaurants are easy. Car stuff is not.

3078 2018-12-04 19:27:11 It's killing Canadians.

You're just too blind to see anything but cheap oil for AC when we have plenty of oil right here.  

Oh yeah, the pipelines.  Right.

3080 2018-12-04 19:27:03 Thanks trump for getting ready to ruin a national park to drill for oil
3081 2018-12-04 19:26:54 Inflation data was 4% below expectations due to cheap oil & tax cuts on major goods. The tax cuts will expire by the end of the year and people are eyeing TCB's decision on rates. Key level I'm watching on the USD pair is 5.8 & 6.
3082 2018-12-04 19:26:53 Just spitballin' here, but maybe Texas has a lot of INDIVIDUALS who work in the oil and gas industry??? From that CEO you're so concerned about all the way down to the hourly employees who clean the CEO's office.
3083 2018-12-04 19:26:48 and yes I'm saying there is no meaningful reversal of environmental damage from the oil and gas industry in Canada. impacts last many generations and in most cases ecosystems never recover. we all suffer the consequences while 'investors' reap short-term profits
3084 2018-12-04 19:26:44 A lot of the oil/gas office jobs in Calgary are never coming back as many have been computerized. Alberta is a dynamic place and has to redirect that skill and talent to building a new economy. Too bad there is little left of the Heritage Fund to assist the transition.
3085 2018-12-04 19:26:42 And?? Wanna know what west Texas has a lot of? The Oil industry (and those it employs). Wanna know what those kinds of donations scream? Big Oil thought he might win.

3087 2018-12-04 19:26:35 I dunno. I’d look at that list and wonder why a Congressman from Wisconsin is getting oil and gas donations comparable to a Senate Candidate from an oil and gas producing state. 

But that’s just me.

3090 2018-12-04 19:26:17 Oil is actually trading very well today....It is closing positive with this meltdown in stocks. Today was very ugly in some risk markets.

3092 2018-12-04 19:26:09 @RachelNotley got what she wanted. First coal, and now the "coddled" oil industry is in the tank. Instead of putting Alberta first, like she could have when she was elected, she sided with climate-alarmists, who are now celebrating heavy oil's demise. Nice work. #cndpoli #abpoli

3096 2018-12-04 19:25:29 In addition, the oil market had changed since the initial approval. The lower price (and resulting demand for pipeline capacity) together with a more fulsome view of the concerns led to the current government deciding it was not in the national interest.

3097 2018-12-04 19:25:23 Americans say pour more money into infrastructure but then you say “replace road with train an ban combustion engine” they start crying because independence from car and oil companies and having to move into affordable housing that goes along with this vision would be hard :(
3098 2018-12-04 19:25:20 You can essential oils in place of petrol oil. Just put some lavender oil in there.
3099 2018-12-04 19:25:16 People in the US DO NOT WANT coastal drilling, cruel capture and sale of wild horses to slaughter houses, the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to be destroyed  by oil drilling, you selling leases to public lands for corruptly low prices.
3100 2018-12-04 19:25:14 Sooner or later the oil runs out, then its just a wrench and some super glue away from being replaced.

"sorry to bother you"...
go stick your head back in the sand.
3103 2018-12-04 19:24:53 The oil companies are celebrating. They have a vested interest in upending the electric car industry. Duh.
3104 2018-12-04 19:24:50 No fucking way fam
3105 2018-12-04 19:24:43 Trump had a &#8216;prophet&#8217; secretly anoint every White House door with olive oil to ward off demons: SHOULDA USED OPEC OIL !! DEMONS TO WARD OFF DEMONS ? THAT DON'T MAKE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER !!
3106 2018-12-04 19:24:42 Global oil prices haven't collapsed. They are rebounding nicely. The price Canada gets has collapsed. Libs also just voted against a bereavement leave. Libs killed energy east and came back with c69. Libs are still doing business with the Saudis. Do you need more?
3107 2018-12-04 19:24:40 So you mean he got money from ordinary people? Why would that qualify as oil and gas?
3108 2018-12-04 19:24:37 Feds don't set oil price.....it's called "free enterprise"!!
3109 2018-12-04 19:24:31 The Putin-MBS #highfive: cut oil production = increased US gas prices = increased inflation = more interest rate hikes =  #marketcrash = spit on US
3110 2018-12-04 19:24:28 Here's a statement lougheed made that was partially true. "most of our drilling compqnies qre abandoni us and going South" the truth is they were US companies going home becquse they coul no longer make big profits from our oil industry. Canadian drillers prospered at that time.
3111 2018-12-04 19:24:28 We are not the way ahead. CA has increased fracking and oil drilling since closing San Onofre and now Diablo, the only reason we are "meeting goals" is because of pledges to buy lands in South American countries as credits. We had the worst air quality in decades this summer.
3112 2018-12-04 19:24:24 If you cook it well, I put oil in a saucepan then tomato purée then water then seasonings fry it abit then put the rice in

The Oil/Vinegar are key. It’s what makes gives it the Italian sub status!

3115 2018-12-04 19:24:10 Yeah I don’t really trade copper. Oil still looks nice here as a hedge against any risk off positions you may have
3116 2018-12-04 19:24:09 Hey! We only use @RSPOtweets certified sustainable palm oil in our products 
3117 2018-12-04 19:24:07 And they're just dead cells
3118 2018-12-04 19:23:29 AGAIN, that is an export pipeline. It has literally nothing to do with the oil we use here. Shipping away our oil will not end our usage of Saudi oil. But ending Saudi arms sales WILL end one area of support for them.
3119 2018-12-04 19:23:28 How can we take their oil?
3120 2018-12-04 19:23:21 Dos politicians that share rice and groundnut oil during campaign we eat beans also. Please make it rice and beans.

3129 2018-12-04 19:22:35 You nailed it...Putin gets well over 60 % of his GNP from oil and gas sales into Europe...if that’s not a leverage point for the Euros what is?

3131 2018-12-04 19:22:30 @realDonaldTrump hired a Christian “prophet” disguised as a janitor, instructed him to anoint every door with olive oil in a bid to ward off demons, asking, ‘hey, you got some of that oil stuff…?’ ‘What oil?’ ‘You know, the stuff that you guys put on things.’,”
3132 2018-12-04 19:22:28 Hillary Clinton said "All Lives Matter" and Obama told us to thank him for massively increasing the wealth of bankers and making the US the largest oil producer in the world. 

These are the people Democrats find acceptable.

3136 2018-12-04 19:21:59 Agreed. He is just a snake oil salesman with enough truth to look tempting. But no way to keep the promises made

3145 2018-12-04 19:21:13 The countries involved did not collectively write a check to Iran. The money was revenue from oil and gas sales that foreign banks were forced to hold over the years until the agreement.  The US would not therefore have been able to use those funds as you appear to imply.
3146 2018-12-04 19:21:12 I am very close to that. I eliminate green pepper and olives and oil and red wine. And add in pickles and mayonnaise

3150 2018-12-04 19:20:50 He made a disingenuous effort to highlight a fraction of his individual donations in an effort to imply Beto was beholden to oil/gas. He didn’t mention Beto got far more money from other industries, or was a top recipient of their money. That tweet thread wasn’t journalism.
3151 2018-12-04 19:20:37 Do they even know what year it is?  Do they think electric cars are already over?  From day 1 of 45, I feel like I am being pushed back to the past, to some period we have left behind, esp with talk of coal and oil and coastal drilling.  Renewable energy is now, and the future.

3154 2018-12-04 19:20:28 That’s on Bernie and his Berners who helped put Trump in the WH with this nonsense. The donations are from the employees not the corporate heads of the oil industry. Bernie and his hack Sirota know that!

3173 2018-12-04 19:19:09 The original comment was about oil prices going up, followed by the post by @JoeySmoey5 saying if renewable energy wasnt being help back by GOP then we wouldn't rely on oil so much.We get almost 0% energy from oil.Transitioning to renewables would not affect oil consumption much.
3174 2018-12-04 19:19:06 I'm referring to every product I've bought here for my oil pen. Each battery lasts me maybe 2 months where my battery I had from WA lasted me two years. And the cartridges leak, which may be due to humidity.? AND it all costs less in WA.

3180 2018-12-04 19:18:44 It couldn't have been done without MbS's knowledge & heads  would literally roll if it had been. Helping them bomb Yemen & starve people to death is not what American should be involved in all for the sake of oil and the sale of fighter jets and military advice.

3182 2018-12-04 19:18:24 He received no corporate cash Bernie bro. This is from oil and gas employees. You guys are so predictable and so pathetic.

Jews: Oil enough for ONE day lasts eight?! You know what? Fuck it. This bargain deserves a holiday. That is just an absolutely superior product at a great value

3188 2018-12-04 19:17:46 There's a whole story. But the oil and menora will always get the most attention :)

3190 2018-12-04 19:17:14 The GOP has a morally depraved army if being a good soldier means aiding in the concealment of murder to retain arms deals and cheap oil.
3191 2018-12-04 19:17:06 16% of oil in the country and I'm here to talk to you about lifting
3192 2018-12-04 19:16:51 If a guy works at a gas station and contributes $20 to Beto, thats oil/gas industry.
3193 2018-12-04 19:16:44 I am so crippled by anxiety that I’m about to go on a 10km jog to purchase CBD oil
3194 2018-12-04 19:16:34 ah, come here... what? you have oil on your face, is all...
3195 2018-12-04 19:16:26 With the #PTO, prices of goods like oil from @PetropolGOV or minerals from @2018Minerite would only fluctuate due to supply and demand. Tariffs would become obsolete, and regulations on prices or on tariffs would also not be needed. More time can be spent solving other problems.
3196 2018-12-04 19:16:21 It really irritates me
3197 2018-12-04 19:16:14 Start by enabling sustainable development through municipal bond markets building localized cogenerating storage and production from Living Water for the Healing of the Nations. What's easier compressing air or mining for coal and oil?
3198 2018-12-04 19:16:12 While still subsidizing coal and oil.
3199 2018-12-04 19:16:11 why is China buying US duration in size scary?  Ppl are just looking at the rate move and think the market is saying something about growth. It isn't.  Why would China be back buying US bonds, and doing IP protections (google NDRC), and taking delivery of US oil? Not risk-off
3200 2018-12-04 19:15:59 One of the best smells ever: butter and olive oil sizzling #werecooking
3201 2018-12-04 19:15:54 The Brooklyn DA is actually the only office that started to decline prosecution of THC oil possession cases.
3202 2018-12-04 19:15:51 1) the oil sector doesn’t get subsidies 
2) no 
3) we are already neutral 
4) green jobs are being created but they are all in China.
3203 2018-12-04 19:15:48 My opinion is based after reading the context of Beto being #1 in oil industry donations. The $ came from many single (not 1 big) donors, in Texas, where many ppl work in the oil industry! He was also #1 in other industries too which wasn't mentioned, bc didn't fit his narrative.
3204 2018-12-04 19:15:47 Whip together 3 pints broccoli with 4 cups banana. Sprinkle with Olive Oil. Set aside for 3 days Serve on salad
3205 2018-12-04 19:15:45 Odd how the policy book, you know, that thing that keeps track of official policy, mentions nothing about pipelines at all. Also, pipelines are not the only way to transport oil, so even if blocking pipelines was "federal NDP policy" you'd still be off-base.
3206 2018-12-04 19:15:44 Yes.  As well as a lesson in that if oil and gas is a major employer in the state, many individual donors will work for.....wait for it, oil and gas!
3207 2018-12-04 19:15:41 Finally getting an oil change after 2 months of being at 0%. Look at me #adulting
3208 2018-12-04 19:15:37 Contrary to all Trump’s claims to rationalize him looking the other way on the #MBS murder, there are $14 Billion in confirmed Saudi deals, and they currently represent only 9% of our oil imports.

Canada  who he pisses in the wind at each week, provides 40% of our imported Oil
3209 2018-12-04 19:15:30 There was harmattan around that time last year. Like a lot of people travelled
3210 2018-12-04 19:15:29 ...HOWEVER, CBD oil should be federally and state legal. Other anticonvulsants can be barbiturates and those are legal. People shouldn’t die because politicians want to push bogus “tough on drugs” stuff.
3211 2018-12-04 19:15:28 Yall really expect women to know how to cook....half yall don’t even know to change the oil lmao
3212 2018-12-04 19:15:22 Enough with the pleasantries, let's just oil up and get fucking.

Same ppl label ANY conservative groups as hate groups.
3216 2018-12-04 19:15:09 I gave you multiple examples of why the US invasion made things worse and you think they’re going to fix it? This US doesn’t go anywhere to help, as long oil is there, the US will stay there. Your call if you want to help continue their imperialism, but expect to get dragged
3217 2018-12-04 19:15:08 Some will be posing as if they carrying some expensive stuff
3218 2018-12-04 19:15:08 My point is that he's not meaningfully "in the pocket" of anyone, at least based on this stat. Like, if he was particularly the favorite of oil & gas donors, sure, but he was #1 among dozens of industries. Which suggests his ranking is the result of sheer volume.
3219 2018-12-04 19:14:59 IRAQ OIL MINISTER: TOO EARLY TO SAY IF OUTPUT CUT NEEDED
3220 2018-12-04 19:14:54 So this guy with a Tesla model S just pulled in to the shop and asked for an oil change 
3221 2018-12-04 19:14:49 I am always looking through a liquor industry lens. Tweed reminds me a lot of Constellation..it's probably going to be a great marriage. All flash no real cred. Even Constellation's prestige products are the things I sold to rich oil dudes with more money than brains.
3222 2018-12-04 19:14:44 Look at d pic I posted 
3223 2018-12-04 19:14:39 Ah, That explains the basket of warbertons 50/50 a bowl of Sarson's Vinegar and some cooking oil last time, I guess we got to get used to it in post Brexit Britain.

3225 2018-12-04 19:14:22 red wine both increases and decreases your risk of cancer

3226 2018-12-04 19:14:20 Great attempt to combine a corrupt case with a fabricated one! Augusta is the one under scrutiny here, Rafale was just hot air. It's like mixing oil n water. Anyway let's see if we can get anything out of this... I am skeptical due to past attempts...the gandhis seem too slick 
3227 2018-12-04 19:14:17 Yo, and what with Qatar saying up yours to OPEC recently, I reckon itll be swords at dawn quite possibly soon, oil price wise. Innit.

3229 2018-12-04 19:14:00 We gone end up doing 40 slabs fucking around with Avis I wanna cut his old ass open and see if its blood or oil coming out
3230 2018-12-04 19:13:59 It is just another drug, like the 20 or so others. Each has a different impact on different patients. CBD oil works for some, mostly children with a specific, limited form of epilepsy. It is not a cure all. The  “legalize marijuana” crowd has hijacked us to advance their agenda.
3231 2018-12-04 19:13:55 My Dad just texted me "WTF" in regards to @SubaruCanada refusing to do an oil consumption test on his 2013 legacy 3.6r which uses over 2 liters of oil in between oil changes. Car is still in warranty until Mar 2019. Every service has been performed by the dealer in Vernon BC

3232 2018-12-04 19:13:54 @TheAJayII you should listen to oil of every pearl’s un-insides by SOPHIE
3233 2018-12-04 19:13:52 Retrain albertans in renewable energy production.  Oil is not the future and soon won’t be the present either.
3234 2018-12-04 19:13:50 He didn't take corporate money. He took money from people in Texas that work for oil and gas companies, even if that means they are a janitor at an oil and gas company.

Mr. Sirota chose not to explain this.
3235 2018-12-04 19:13:47 They've used this tactic often to discredit people.  Employees of gas/oil companies could make individual contributions to a candidate and it shows up as being tied to their employer.  Hillary got lots of "Wall St." money.  Duh, she represented the area.
3236 2018-12-04 19:13:36 I have to wonder, did the oil plunge even help retail?  I know retail stocks have rallied but they always seem to rally between Labor Day and Black Friday.  I mean I know higher gas = less money for everything else, maybe I’m just questioning if we got a boost recently anyways
3237 2018-12-04 19:13:31 Yeah, that pisses me off more than anything: anytime there's a spike in price (shortages or whatever), we feel it in our wallets. But when the cause of the spike returns to normal, prices never do. Coffee, the fake bacon shortage, now oil. Price at my pump hasn't changed.
3238 2018-12-04 19:13:30 *Would rather buy products packaged in petroleum, shipped with fuel, and support use of oil from human rights ignoring regimes with almost no environmental laws than support change in our own country when it’s well timed* cool. If you don’t want opinions ask over DM.
3239 2018-12-04 19:13:27 Ou même oil afin d'alimenter les machines capable l'extraction.
Du point de vue de l'électricité l'extraction de lithium (pour le moment) aura un impact certe à l'extraction mais ensuite quasi rien du au fait qu'il est recyclable
3240 2018-12-04 19:13:25 Sirota neglects to mention the donations were from employees of oil & gas companies — not corporate heads. Implied the same crap when Hillary was running against Bernie. His gullible rookie supporters ate it up.

3243 2018-12-04 19:13:09 Wrong. They need & want our heavy oil. I believe 2 of the US heavy oil refineries are offline for maintenance, which has slowed demand - that, combined with lack of pipelines to other markets, has resulted in a backlog.
3244 2018-12-04 19:12:43 me mandaron un mensaje y lo borraron lpm, lo único que llegue a leer fue " en fuel oil" ay puede ser cualquier cosa xd

3246 2018-12-04 19:12:39 It’s interesting that the entire thread response is upset that he didn’t mention Obama instead of being upset about the FACT that Bush Sr was a war mongering oil lobby president who illegally invaded several countries.
3247 2018-12-04 19:12:39 Broda.. Did u toast her? If yes congrats else OYO is ur case
3248 2018-12-04 19:12:38 @dick_nixon so what. he IS from texas and oil/gas touches millions with employment, related businesses etc. help of a lot of property taxes for schools. what a comment. AND... all that $$$ helped @BetoORourke get that giant turnout and give him NATIONAL recognition. duh.
3249 2018-12-04 19:12:33 I support your #GreenNewDeal but attacking Tesla is misguided- it is literally the greatest US clean-Tech success story. The loan was repaid w interest unlike oil subsidies. 10M+ sq ft factories in NV,CA & NY. Solar+ Electric car is solution to pollution 40k+ Jobs.  Made in USA
3250 2018-12-04 19:12:17 It just happens that we need a new technology in modifying the oil. &gas industry  and not shutting it.... What sufficient  energy is there left wid?????

3256 2018-12-04 19:11:33 Oil and gas, Bond! Well, well. We got a high stakes player on our hands. PS please buy #OPM 
3257 2018-12-04 19:11:32 Scotland does not own whisky, but an independant Scotland would gain the taxes associated with it and a nationalised Scottish oil company could gain the profits to Scotland similar to Statoil in Norway, the key is independence.
3258 2018-12-04 19:11:26 Every year I appease my lawyers by dusting off forced, pandering tweet about Jews lighting Christmas candles. Wish that oil had lasted eight minutes, not eight days! Would take Much Less time away from a Real American Holiday! MAKE DECEMBER ALL-CHRISTMAS AGAIN!

But I digress show me where he's number 2 on taking money from things like the NRA are from oil...... You can't do that now can you?  Taking some money vs. being number 2 in a oil...
3260 2018-12-04 19:11:17 If two families share a very low taxed house and have a total of 6- 8 children between them they pay very little compared to the citizen family in 1 house of higher value w/2 children for schools. Real example of higher resource use while paying very little

3265 2018-12-04 19:11:02 So, your average oil & gas employee can afford a $2,700 political donation?  Is that what you are suggesting?
3266 2018-12-04 19:10:51 To season, sand the bottom smooth w/ plumber’s cloth. Heat oven to 500. Cover pan with a light coating of flack seed oil and throw it in for an hour (warning: it will smoke up your place; that’s normal). It will make a nice, glassy nonstick finish.
3267 2018-12-04 19:10:50 Hi Greg, the car wasn't that expensive. We got the fully loaded model, and with all the various discounts and incentives it cost in the low $30K. There's virtually no maintenance on an EV - no oil changes etc, and it costs less than 1/2 as much to charge than to buy gas.

3274 2018-12-04 19:10:10 I’ve been needing a oil change since like last year lmao
3275 2018-12-04 19:10:08 This Albertan agrees, but the first problem that needs to be addressed is how do we convince those Albertans whose love was bought with high paying, low barrier of entry jobs that the oil industry doesn't actually have their best interests at heart? If you have any ideas...

3280 2018-12-04 19:09:38 Aku bukannya pingin nyinyir anu itu cuma pas boomingnya olive oil jadi moisturizer (?) sempet bertanya-tanya, rating comedogenicnya olive oil ini berapa ya? Soalnya oil oilan tuh ngeri bats kalau tida tepat nanti malah clog pores dan lalu yah gitu
3281 2018-12-04 19:09:27 When you look over the retailer package. Let me know and I will make sure to send you a sample of the massage oil before it comes fully 
3282 2018-12-04 19:09:24 I will when I have time and the marzipan. That was less about the stollen and more about the pervasiveness of palm oil, and in stuff that never used to use it. I feel like the only one who gets riled about it sometimes. "Vegan" butter, especially, that uses it.

3289 2018-12-04 19:09:04 Even in Houston it’s like “he was great”, but people aren’t weeping or whatever. Guy was what, 94? I’d sign up for that right fuckin now.
3290 2018-12-04 19:08:39 I feel horrible like oil and water on stomach
3291 2018-12-04 19:08:32 Season it well add a little bit of oil and corn flour to make it crispy. You can either bake it for 20 minutes or fry in a little oil until golden brown. You can then eat it how it is or add a sauce it's so good in a stir-fry too 
3292 2018-12-04 19:08:29 Try taking some fish oil. Relatively cheap and it helps with joints

3294 2018-12-04 19:08:22 What a surprise to find the Shell Sky scenario rather than rely on massive tech to ‘solve’ the problem (with hi oil till 2040-70) they fully embrace the huge imbalance in responsibility for CO2 & propose radical policies to change the behaviour & practices of wealthy hi-emitters!

3297 2018-12-04 19:07:57 Also since you’re probably a “follow the money” conspiracy theorist, approx $42 Billion has been spent on Climate research between 1993 and 2014. Twenty one years.  BP Oil ALONE in the year 2017 made $244 Billion. Just BP. But I’ll just let you live in your Trump bubble. Smh.

3304 2018-12-04 19:07:35 Oil prices and fuel prices don't necessarily correlate you morons. How can you be reporters when you're so spectacularly ignorant?
Environmental legislation on refineries and the transition of shipping fuel from crude to diesel is causing scarcity. + added taxes drive prices up.
3305 2018-12-04 19:07:32 $105 for a FUCKING oil change you have to be kitten me
3306 2018-12-04 19:07:12 Not how much they pay, its quantity of resources consumed. The short article is more about Trump bashing than a well crafted anylisis of taxes paid vs resources/ services provided
3307 2018-12-04 19:07:09 Why repudiate facts? Beto shouldn't take oil money, it's simple really. Even Obama said accepting Corporate Money compromised his politics, what, you don't believe him?
3308 2018-12-04 19:07:08 Yeah, this dude's way off the reservation: "Tehran insists its missile programme is purely defensive but has threatened to disrupt oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf if Washington tries to strangle its exports."

Notice the "but".
3309 2018-12-04 19:06:57 Any politician seen to be bribing voters should be held accountable. In a country with so much pverty, give the right amount of rive and palm oil and you can win.
3310 2018-12-04 19:06:55 Brian, Oil and Gas isn't subsidized in Canada. They do receive loans that are paid back with interest. The Liberal government purchased the TMX for $4.5B only to ensure it never gets built.
But what you're saying is we can count on your vote for Alberta to leave confederation?

3312 2018-12-04 19:06:52 Did you try 5-HTP supplement?  CBD oil? People say these things helped them.
3313 2018-12-04 19:06:38 Make sure you are getting good quality sleep. Sleep is so important. CBD oil is my go-to remedy for anxiety.

3315 2018-12-04 19:06:18 It's kinda fun watching oil create that rick-rack pattern. Otherwise it' a bloodbath.
3316 2018-12-04 19:06:14 And you don't say a word when journalists and opposition leaders are killed by African dictators. What's with Saudi Arabia? Is it their oil? Please apply equal standard to your outrage.
3317 2018-12-04 19:06:13 Looking forward to trying the massage oil.
3318 2018-12-04 19:06:11 Ya oil companies give money to politicians who buy big cadillacs
Another issue i have is the #SeparationOfCorporationAndState
We need donation laws ending the practice of corporations, lobbies& foreign entities buying politicians
Call it the #DrainTheSwamp promise trump made
3319 2018-12-04 19:05:41 Ukraine, Iranian missiles, Russian violations of INF, the New 'Liberal' Order, Iran threatening to cut oil access.....so many coincidences involving the same players in one way or another....??
3320 2018-12-04 19:05:31 My friend had breast cancer sent into remission it came back in her liver & spine, she’s taking cannabis oil & it’s stopped it from growing. The spots on her lungs have also gone. She too weak for more chemo but she’s stopped being sick & is eating have you tried cannabis oil?
3321 2018-12-04 19:05:21 Probably against radical #climate alarm activists like those who blockaded pipeline and oil refinery works in Burnaby earlier this year, maybe also some First Nations groups. It's sad to say but civil disobedience tactics are raising new threats of violence in #cdnpoli too.
3322 2018-12-04 19:05:11 Looking back at the last 4 US Senator elections in Texas in non Presidential years (2018, 2014, 2006, 2002) and a Texas senatorial candidate tops that list every time. It's almost as if Texas voters derive a disproportionate percentage of their income from oil & gas! 
3323 2018-12-04 19:04:58 Fuck Tech N9ne & his shallow fear mongering+snake oil bullshit. Him & his crew remind me of the "alt right" con men & clowns like Alex Jones.
3324 2018-12-04 19:04:50 That's why you should investigate properly before posting things.
3325 2018-12-04 19:04:47 MEMO from the SUPREME CONSERVATIVE.  The Ideological Alberta government is not doing enough to get our clean ethical Alberta oil to Market,  Effective immediately all members of @UCPCaucus vacationing on the coast are order to take a barrel of bitumen in their carry on luggage.
3326 2018-12-04 19:04:43 As a tried and true Latke hater I could not disagree more, I think it is so easy for me to defend a delicious pastry that can be filled with so many great fillings then a dried out oil dripping burnt potato
3327 2018-12-04 19:04:43 Singing we need the Oil
Oil of the Lord
3328 2018-12-04 19:04:38 Agreed. The govt already gave $180M to this charity (2018-21). The $$ could have gone to homeless vets (who apparently “ask for too much”), unempl oil patch families (who JT seems to despise), or creating a GP that coordinates autism initiatives across Cda ( Libs voted against).
3329 2018-12-04 19:04:38 If there is anything of that "whore" type it would be Trump. Babylon, is now Baghdad, Iraq, home of the US largest Embassy..larger than Vatican City. Trump is dealing with Saudis over Iraq oil...among other items, like arms.
3330 2018-12-04 19:04:28 What about western oil crisis
3331 2018-12-04 19:04:24 Tonga agrees to reduce coconut oil production by 25%, leading to uncertainty in US market cardiology HMO futures.
3332 2018-12-04 19:04:23 cocoa butter and almond oil does the body right
3333 2018-12-04 19:04:21 Beto didn't take money from oil companies.  He accepted contributions from individuals that work in the oil industry.  It is Texas, people, oil is the biggest industry in Texas.  $ from individuals vs. $ from companies.  @davidsirota is also Bernie @SenSanders spokesperson. Liar.
3334 2018-12-04 19:04:17 Anyone with a good parka and winter boots want to go to the Artic National Wildlife Refuge and lay down in front of the oil drilling rigs? It is beyond horrific to drill for oil we do not need and should not be using. Let's create jobs from cleaner energy. Let's save the world.
3335 2018-12-04 19:04:14 Good news keep pilling up 10y now at 2.89% down 10% from last month
This will be great for home building and corporate investment 
Fed will have to lower rate in December because of oil deflation

3336 2018-12-04 19:04:08 Truth will come out ....  who or what party is getting kick backs from Saudi oil.  Irving oil or Petro can
3337 2018-12-04 19:04:02 Isn't it the UN's "job" to help? Bring on food for oil 2.0!
3338 2018-12-04 19:04:00 I need my oil changed 
3339 2018-12-04 19:03:56 Don't forget Imperial Oil.
3340 2018-12-04 19:03:48 THEALEK BALDWIN PLEASE DONT EAT SHIT. YOU CAN KISS VLADIMIR PUTIN IN HIS ASS. WHO MADE 801 MILITARY BASSES IN THE WORLD. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLIKANS WORKS FOR AMERICAN MAFIA INDUSTRIAL MILITARY AND BANK - OIL CLANS. RUSSIA TRY TO BE FRIEND FOR EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.

3342 2018-12-04 19:03:37 So basically me being a total mess with hair as if it was dunked in potato fries oil is normal to u...okay.
3343 2018-12-04 19:03:32 Why it takes so long to get a oil change
3344 2018-12-04 19:03:27 i don’t care if the engine about to blow, i only came for an oil change 
3345 2018-12-04 19:03:21 There's a difference between fairness and equality. Should we pay plumbers the same as doctors? Oil workers the same as secretarys? You're not accounting for reality when you just call for "equal pay"

3347 2018-12-04 19:03:05 Wtf? Have you stopped drilling oil you newspeak Janus faced snakes. What percentage of the world’s pollution are you responsible for 10-20%? Come back when you’ve modified your model to renewable energy.
3348 2018-12-04 19:02:56 I used to watch staged riots all the time when I was traveling overseas in the oil business.  CNN sets up and they had out Money & signs for a 15 minute film take and that's a fact Jack!
3349 2018-12-04 19:02:48 Heavy oil heater? You must live in a good quiet place!
3350 2018-12-04 19:02:46 Boy, can you imagine the West not invading the third world for oil and influence and also not establishing aliances that completly undermind the West values such as freedom or sovereingty.
Can you also imagine complaining about the most obvious consequences such as migration?
3351 2018-12-04 19:02:44 Did you read the other responses on the above thread?  Any person employed in the Oil & Gas industry, even if they are a gas station attendant, is counted as "Oil & Gas".  *SMDH*
3352 2018-12-04 19:02:36 Bruh, you never licked oil off someone"s face?
3353 2018-12-04 19:02:31 I agree..olive oil leads the pack in the kitchen
3354 2018-12-04 19:02:20 We're sorry to hear about this, Chelsea. Mike's Way includes onion, lettuce, tomato, oil, vinegar, and spices. We hope you'll give us another try!
3355 2018-12-04 19:02:18 cooking oil makes me so anxious omg
3356 2018-12-04 19:02:17 Related to trust / If there is a point to not taking oil money, then it is the promise that you won’t be influenced by an industry. Can someone who receives the 3rd or 4th highest amount of money from an industry’s employees claim no influence? It’s a question to ask.
3357 2018-12-04 19:02:12 え、え、なんで自殺させてくれないんですか(RT)

3361 2018-12-04 19:01:38 If you have the time to stand around and talk about your escapades at the gym, you have time to do an oil change. I'm your boss, not your friend.
3362 2018-12-04 19:01:36 Are the PADD 3 refineries designed to process heavy oil ?
3363 2018-12-04 19:01:21 Smeara Tanden upset that @davidsirota's tweet re: oil/gas industry donations showed Beto O'Roarke as #2 recipient?

Beto took the $$. Exposure of it being considered an attack defies logic.

Bitter-ender estbl. Dems/Hilbots aren't big on logic.

Illogical hysteria = their oxygen.
3364 2018-12-04 19:01:17 Why is that? Oil rose to $80 a barrel under Trump. Sure, it's down to $52, Obama had it lower FYI, and it's going to go right back up. Let's also look at environmental impacts and Europe has a great transit system so they are trying to encourage people not to drive.
3365 2018-12-04 19:01:10 Google searches led to Wikepedia and clicked on people links that looked interesting. Look at Clinton's pardon list and click on Marc Rich. That's where I saw Comey'sname name investigation in oil scam involving contractors etc.
3366 2018-12-04 19:01:01 They take forever to change my oil, I’m   ready to go smh
3367 2018-12-04 19:00:57 You anoint my head with Essential healing oil; my cup overflows. 
Surely light and love of the infinite One Creator will follow me all the days of my life, 
And I will dwell in the house of Oneness forever. 
Amen.
3368 2018-12-04 19:00:55 I bet they dip them in some olive oil for lubrication

3370 2018-12-04 19:00:53 We need to produce more making Iran’s oil less valuable.

3381 2018-12-04 18:59:58 I think your right @JaroGiesbrecht we do need real time #oil production numbers, by all the oil producers in #Alberta. As well we need a team watching out for scheduled shut downs of refineries pipeline delays, to protect the price of Alberta oil
#Abpoli #Ableg #Canadianpoli
3382 2018-12-04 18:59:46 My house has oil heat and is slowly killing my whole family so I’m taking one for the team to save them and gave them my humidifier... rip me, let the rest live on
3383 2018-12-04 18:59:40 Hey I’ve heard that before from people but I’m telling you (and any lady) get the man sole decent beard oil and knowledge of how to trim and you will not want him to go back.
3384 2018-12-04 18:59:38 In a national race, sure. 

In a state race, where there isn't much need for PACs (unless you're just that corrupt), individual donations might as well be PAC money.

If Bernie took that much from the oil/gas industry, individual or not, that's a cause for concern. Same for Beto.
3385 2018-12-04 18:59:34 renewable energy will never replace oil anytime soon. It replaces coal and natural gas, which we get from ourselves or Canada. All the solar in the world wont replace the millions of gas cars that US citizens own, and that is not converting to electric very fast.
3386 2018-12-04 18:59:28 Glad you think you've done something good how about dealing with the opiod epedemic we're currently dealing with or perhaps a pipeline to get oil to better markets? You have done nothing but leagalize pot. Get in the game before it passes you up for good.

3388 2018-12-04 18:59:24 Did a pick up, got my Lou’s, onto my oil change and home. Kinda productive day
3389 2018-12-04 18:59:14 Key to this is, how did Beto vote on measures of interest to big oil?
3390 2018-12-04 18:59:14 Maybe the state or fed govt should consider giving a billion in tax breaks to companies in re-newable energy. Brings jobs for a more green-economy. We already give tax subsidies to big oil and gas. Why not create jobs that will help save the planet? instead of helping the wealthy
3391 2018-12-04 18:59:12 Thanks. Just need an oven, the record, a bowl the size you want and veg oil
3392 2018-12-04 18:58:59 Well, of course. And the Canadian anti pipeline protests have some Russian backing because who benefits from land-locked Alberta oil? They’re everywhere. McCarthy was just a few decades too early.
3393 2018-12-04 18:58:57 There you go again - “oil donors” - an utter misrepresentation. It’s simply a false claim.
3394 2018-12-04 18:58:55 Yet the US is trying to be an exporter of shale oil?They use our cheap oil and export the fracked oil that has never,once paid for it's extraction cost?The entire thing is so twisted.We are being screwed at the pump.#ALLIKNOW
3395 2018-12-04 18:58:52 It’s simple, with oil down and dollar up a recession is ahead for sure. With trade wars and uncertainty we are doomed. Get out of markets or @realDonaldTrump & Co will take your last cent. @CNBC @FoxBusiness @foxandfriends @MSNBC
3396 2018-12-04 18:58:47 Who's going to complain when the tax is given back in grants that will save you more money every month on electricity than the increased inflation on oil?
It would maybe increase your gas bill,  but the converted house would need to produce enough for you to power an electric car
3397 2018-12-04 18:58:34 Howard Dean - Lifelong Democrats still have a duty to question what’s going on inside the party- without self-examination and reflection - credibility is lints with voters. Trust is an important issue these days. Beto promised no corporate/oil money. Do leaders count?

3399 2018-12-04 18:58:26 The amount of oil shipped by rail has doubled since the Lac-Mé​gantic tragedy –from an average of 135,658 barrels a day in July 2013 to a record 269,829 barrels a day in September 2018.That's putting pressure on railways to find enough crews, locomotives and tracks to do the work
3400 2018-12-04 18:58:12 Who me??? Sonia defo is. But I agree with her black soap and water are key. Also tea tree oil and rosehip oil too
3401 2018-12-04 18:58:11 If EPL is down (power outage) today in SK and no lines are pumping oil...means oil piling up in Alberta and more length for January injections. Potentially higher January apportionment in pipe and “could” mean wider diffs on heavy. Not a good start for the new plan...#shithappens
3402 2018-12-04 18:58:07 The forests are renewable, and close to zero carbon, the coal and oil are neither!
3403 2018-12-04 18:58:06 ya know if the gov supported renewable energy we wouldn't need relationships with any oil rich country. But then Trump wouldn't have a way to schill his hotel deals on the taxpayer dime. #cheaptrumps
3404 2018-12-04 18:58:05 -sigh- Looking forward to Jason Kenney derailing Alberta's economic recovery, like Ralph Klein did in the 90s, by punishing public sector works for having the gall to work in industries that aren't, and should not be, affected by the oil and gas boom and bust cycle.
3405 2018-12-04 18:58:00 Wants us to be dependent on fossil fuels oil, coal how stupid
3406 2018-12-04 18:57:43 what exactly do you do with the castor oil though? lmao i keep reading “castor oil” but no one says how to use it 
3407 2018-12-04 18:57:37 Do any of you take CBD oil? If so what are your personal pro’s and con’s?
3408 2018-12-04 18:57:35 So clearly, being a good soldier means you lie to the American people? Until @realDonaldTrump, America wouldn't have praised & rewarded Murderous Dictators! We only get 11% of our oil from SA in the 1st place! Why are we selling arms 2 SA they promote instability in the ME?
3409 2018-12-04 18:57:35 Nestle are one of the biggest culprits of misleading...Note: palm oil (commonly marked as vegetable oil) is in nutella, contributes to the Orangutans deforestation.  #unsustainable #dontpalmusoff Mind you it’s high in saturated fat.

needless to say his presence added more oil on the fire despite his element

3419 2018-12-04 18:56:31 I just invented a car the runs on CBD oil. It produces negative 8000% polution and prevents tire wear, passenger aging, and civil wars. Should be moving to market very soon. RT for a chance to win one!
3420 2018-12-04 18:56:31 We don't buy   oil from the Saudis     anymore
3421 2018-12-04 18:56:29 No wicks but plenty of wax, scents, cleaning oil, small pot. A large variety of shapes and sizes. Yin yang 2 piece, hearts, 1/4s, 1/3s, star, etc.
3422 2018-12-04 18:56:23 Thats the one that got killed.The western ones,used for export,were deemed "essential".Trudeau doesn't want it in his yard but he'll risk the entire west coast for oil that's sold at a loss?That Bilderberg bubble.
3423 2018-12-04 18:56:15 Honestly, the oil sands is a tough one for me. I don’t like the environmental impacts because they’ll take ages to reverse but understand it’s the price of industry. We’re not a major player in the carbon game. From an economic and job creation aspect, they’re a good thing...
3424 2018-12-04 18:56:05 Saudis seemingly can do whatever TF they want; blow up our buildings, kill our journalists, starve babies to death, and many other untold atrocities, as long as they let us fly our war machines out of their country and give us cheap oil. THEY are the ones we need to be bombing!

3428 2018-12-04 18:55:25 Jesus Christ just look at all that muck spewing from that rig into the air. Seriously, fuck Big Oil. We could have fixed this two decades ago but BO money corrupted politics and convinced gullible cretins that climate change was a hoax. 
Even Exxon knew about this in the 70s.
3429 2018-12-04 18:55:23 If I were a conspiracy theorist . . .

3430 2018-12-04 18:55:15 Fire Zinke now. 
Zinke's alliance with the oil and gas private corps is his # 1 priority and he does not seem to understand we are in climate warming crisis not " save fossil fuels" mode.
3431 2018-12-04 18:55:08 Organic is better, essential oils work, CBD oil works, natural remedies do exist, plastic sucks thanks for coming to my ted talk
3432 2018-12-04 18:55:08 @Argos_Online Could your otherwise excellent delivery men please be instructed not to carry fridges and freezers on their shoulders and to use a trolley. Apart from the damage to their backs such items should be kept vertical, to avoid oil leaking into the refrigeration system.
3433 2018-12-04 18:55:02 Sounds like the oil patch is breeding DUC's. @LizHampton1986
3434 2018-12-04 18:55:01 What's?Funding healthcare for all middle/poors,instead of big pharma/med industry get rich. What's?investing in renewable energy,turn Arizona etc into a huge solar field,why not?,instead of dishonest&illegal wars for oil for&by rich,that rich try to blame on middle/poors
3435 2018-12-04 18:54:59 Sweet! I quit cold turkey back in 2009. It was so gross, when I cleaned my room...so many things covered in nicotine. I washed my stuffed animals, figurines, wiped off every single CD & DVD case, washed my walls with Murphy's oil soap. Now it sparkles, just like my lungs. 
3436 2018-12-04 18:54:56 Iraqi oil minister says too early to say whether there will be an oil production cut as he arrives in Vienna #OOTT #OPEC
3437 2018-12-04 18:54:55 Quality!
3438 2018-12-04 18:54:52 Fair’s fair, oil prices had gone up a lot :-/
3439 2018-12-04 18:54:32 Then get us off oil @senatemajldr.
3440 2018-12-04 18:54:25 Somebody suggested that to me recently, and I’m so resisting it. I can wear wool with no problem. But I know for sure I’m allergic to rose oil, and it’s not an ingredient in Bite Agave products. I’ll be so bummed if it’s lanolin. For no good reason except I like sheep.
3441 2018-12-04 18:54:24 Anastasia has the dip and brow pencil! However, if you want a cheaper option I like the dip pomade by L’Oréal, I add a drop of oil once in a while!
3442 2018-12-04 18:54:09 There can be a designation that all green equipment must be made in the USA
It would create millions of jobs converting houses
By the time all houses are converted& the grants are paid back, they would hardly depend on carbon tax because we'll have electric cars& no need for oil
3443 2018-12-04 18:54:08 That thc oil aint no joke
3444 2018-12-04 18:54:06 Its a no win situation, replace 1 Prince with another. end up with the same result. Their country, their rules. They control the oil, so it wont change.

3450 2018-12-04 18:53:40 Most notably in Europe and America, because they are far in away the most powerful, but it's worth noting that Japan, Korea, India, and the rich oil states in the Middle East too are turning against immigrants and ethnic/racial minorities.

3456 2018-12-04 18:53:03 Bro, Crude oil struggling with upper side, does it trigger bearish signal
3457 2018-12-04 18:53:01 It' just based on where people work. So a $25 check from a secretary in the payroll department of a refinery shows up as a donation "from" the oil industry.
3458 2018-12-04 18:52:54 @milkmakeup Love you guys!! Looking to reduce my palm oil consumption...can you share info on your sourcing? Maybe add a filter on your product store for palm-oil free products? Thxxx <3
3459 2018-12-04 18:52:30 It stems from an inability to see a bigger picture. It’s like the calls to boycott Saudi oil. That won’t hurt most Canadians, but it’ll drive the price of the gas and oil Atlantic Canada now gets from the US to heat their homes and drive to work, through the freaking roof.
3460 2018-12-04 18:52:30 So, David Sirota has managed to spark a meaningless conspiracy theory about Beto O'Rourke being in the pocket of big oil that his fans have swallowed without questions. Wish I fully understood why though.
3461 2018-12-04 18:52:26 Actually I think they will all be up in that range by tomorrow, could be wrong but oil went up the last 3 days , guess we will see ?
3462 2018-12-04 18:52:24 Reminds me of the local "biochemist" that sells herbs to suckers. I hereby declare myself a biochemist and nutritionist, take my advice and buy this snake oil.
3463 2018-12-04 18:52:13 Extra vintage. Is that the wine equivalent of extra virgin olive oil?
3464 2018-12-04 18:52:08 Chaque prise de parole de Macron coûte au minimum 300 millions d’euros, qu’il n’a pas, et en conséquence il crée un impôt, une taxe, avec l’alibi écologique, ou le réchauffement climatique, essence, gas oil, EDF, GDF très discrètement il assomme un peu plus les plus pauvres
3465 2018-12-04 18:52:02 So an individual employee who works in the oil industry - as a gas station attendant or an administrative assistant etc - and donates $5, $10, $20 is a corrupt influence on a candidate? Wow— all this time I thought that was democracy.
3466 2018-12-04 18:52:01 Last time I checked China and Russia are gonna be taking over the oil game. Petro dollar is trash now. See you on the other side 
3467 2018-12-04 18:51:57 Keep in mind for cattle rations that canola grain with high greens could have 40% oil/fat - rations should have no more than 7%.
3468 2018-12-04 18:51:52 Picking a handful of tech billionaires, claiming they represent the value of immigration is not representative of the group as a whole.  Especially when making no distinction between legal and illegal immigrants
3469 2018-12-04 18:51:48 we'll just hear all about oil prices and how much money Jeff Bezos has lost

3480 2018-12-04 18:51:14 That happened to my car last year and it was bc it needed an oil change desperately
3481 2018-12-04 18:51:07 This can't be better said... Your head get oil Funmi. I heard they burned down an office or so, after mass suspension of students. And that's very logical
3482 2018-12-04 18:51:04 What are some good real coconut oil products ?
3483 2018-12-04 18:51:03 Why is it hat no matter how much I prepare for my big weekly Tuesday 7th grade program, 3 hours before I always feel like I’m scrambling to unlock padlocks, pour oil in weird containers and get my mensch on a bench in the right place!

3485 2018-12-04 18:50:59 Thank you.  AND, to make it crystal clear, @davidsirota isn't promoting "transparency" here by labeling these individual contributions as "oil/gas industry campaign cash." That's not accurate journalism but a smear. Employees are NOT their industry. So sick of this lazy ass shit.
3486 2018-12-04 18:50:58 Is he kidding...I’d rather be boiled in oil.
3487 2018-12-04 18:50:57 Are you using cleaner or oil of olay age defiyer ?

3489 2018-12-04 18:50:40 Tim told me earlier that I am the “oil in the machine that makes everything run”
3490 2018-12-04 18:50:29 I have a much better idea.  Let's have the oil and food producing counties stop selling their products to blue counties. That would fix most of America's cultural problems in a few days.
3491 2018-12-04 18:50:21 YOUR ARAB OIL MOBSTER associate or weapon customer WAS JUST CONVICTED OF MURDER BY THE SENAte COMMITTEE. SEN CORKER SAID EVIDENCE WOULD BE A 30 minute jury conviction.
3492 2018-12-04 18:50:16 People need to learn food is fuel for the body period. America wants a different dinner everyday of the week   keep your foods simple and your body will work alot better   you put the same gas and oil I'm your car but anything down your mouth
3493 2018-12-04 18:49:52 My family so Arab I told my dad my sisters sick and he told me to give her the ol honey and oil mix instead of medicine Lmfao
3494 2018-12-04 18:49:50 Youre like that’s it no more oil changes 
3495 2018-12-04 18:49:49 Yep, all those dem oil workers we keep hearing about
3496 2018-12-04 18:49:43 Aw Deb you know you really wanna know how those corrupt CIA puppet capitalist govt ran up Venezuela's debt to a level unmanageable when oil prices tanked.

3504 2018-12-04 18:48:55 Reading the entire thread, these are individual donations, not corporation donations. The “tea leaf” is that some of this individuals work for oil companies.
3505 2018-12-04 18:48:36 If we place import tariffs& similar fee for oil fracking to the producers that cuts into their profits
With that money, you make repayable grants to homeowners to convert to green power, they get off the grid& instead of an electric bill they pay back $200 a month against grant

3507 2018-12-04 18:48:34 Trump bought an oil painting of himself for $20k with his Charity's money 
3508 2018-12-04 18:48:28 Wrong. Putin wants to supply Chi with Russian energy products. He needs a faster, more dependable route to transport gas and oil products. Crimea was a logical choice. He reversed Khrushev's gift of Crimea to Ukraine taking by force 27 Feb 14. He wants to hold Kerch Straits too.
3509 2018-12-04 18:48:25 Let's see, they blew up the oil market. $USO, Now they are blowing up in the bond market $TLT the stock market is always paying the price for their stupidity. Let's see how many close their doors by year end.
3510 2018-12-04 18:48:21 @anthonymackie is from NOLA. He named it oil, but is pronouncing it properly.
3511 2018-12-04 18:48:17 In looking at the quarter of a million dollars donated by employees in the oil industry, it includes scientists, lawyers, managers...The question is whether Beto was giving the impression that he was NOT taking donations from oil industry employees or just industry.
3512 2018-12-04 18:48:16 Are you really that dumb? The ad is about Obama's voting record, not donations. It clearly says he doesn't take money from the oil lobby. People actually take you seriously? WTF
3513 2018-12-04 18:48:07 Saudi Arabia is not Iran! Saudi Arabia have allies all over Middle East and over the world! SA control oil and followed by many muslims country! Yes, u can do some harm to SA with sanctions,but u r going to harm the US too. Do not use SA in your war with your ELECTED PRESIDENT!!
3514 2018-12-04 18:48:06 My scalp the same way, I can’t use grease  or oil sheen on my scalp it weighs my hair down and make it so heavy & very itchy I can only use oil or do hot oil treatments
3515 2018-12-04 18:47:51 Snake oil sellers, every one of them.
3516 2018-12-04 18:47:50 Exactly. And the problem isn't @davidsirota promoting transparency. It's NOT transparent but dishonest to label individual donations as "oil/gas industry campaign cash." Employees are not the industry. They can't haver other concerns or independence from employer? Bullshit.
3517 2018-12-04 18:47:41 And one train derailment in a city like what happened in Lac Megantic isn’t tragic enough to want to stop moving oil by rail? I live in small town BC the trains carrying oil terrify me!
3518 2018-12-04 18:47:37 ...We arrived to get an oil change on our Malibu...!

3522 2018-12-04 18:47:21 If CIA knows MBS texted exactly 11 times, I have to assume they have the texts. I understand why they wouldn't release them, but hopefully they briefed key Senators in full this morning. It's time for basic morality in American politics. We should STOP buying Saudi oil.
3523 2018-12-04 18:47:03 Guess I’ll get an oil change today. Dropping that $50 hurt every time
3524 2018-12-04 18:47:01 If you read further, Beto had the top 1% of donations from numerous industries, not just oil/energy......From individuals.  David is not being truthful.
3525 2018-12-04 18:46:59 the best thing about cooking with coconut oil is being able to wipe the excess off the spoon and rub it directly onto your hands which makes them all nice n soft
3526 2018-12-04 18:46:58 I’m good with higher oil if it means getting away from the Middle East all together. Israel can take care of themselves, if the alternative means getting involved via financial transactions and weapons sales to equally awful regimes as Iran. Boeing can go back to making planes.
3527 2018-12-04 18:46:57 Going to get an oil change and not getting anything else should be an achievement like Xbox

3534 2018-12-04 18:46:30 Sage and onion goes really well with sausage meat. I would cook in balls brushed with oil though. I focus on simple onion, herbs and citrus in the neck cavity of the bird to add flavour and help with moistness. #TurkeyTuesday

3539 2018-12-04 18:45:55 If Beto can go against the petrocorps that fund him and force them to leave oil in the ground at a massive loss (as required for us to survive) I will knock on every door in the land to get him elected.
3540 2018-12-04 18:45:52 Ask him if he will support Alberta and Saskatchewan and get the oil price crisis on the first ministers agenda
3541 2018-12-04 18:45:44 Sorry James – while I appreciate you making the case for fair and open transparency, labeling the individual donors who also work for oil as "oil/gas industry campaign cash" is NOT accurate journalism. It's a smear. This is Texas. Beto's supposed to refuse $ from oil employees?

3544 2018-12-04 18:45:30 Where have you been for the past 5 years? I can't think of a non-Mediterranean country I've been to where the bread didn't come with a bowl of rapeseed oil to dip it in.

3550 2018-12-04 18:45:12 When this market flush is over, look for a sharp increase in oil price
3551 2018-12-04 18:45:01 Oil pipelines crossing into tribal lands and waterways. Man does not make anything that doesn't eventually breakdown. Having pipelines running in or atop waterways is disaster in the making.
3552 2018-12-04 18:44:59 Yes. We have. And it is reminder of what everywhere will look like when the oil runs out and the crops fail. Except that you won’t be able to fix civil unrest with a tiny policy tweak by then.
3553 2018-12-04 18:44:54 Oil and Gas EMPLOYEES donated the money to, O’Rourke NOT THE CORPORATIONS!

3561 2018-12-04 18:44:12 Hezbollah or Trumpeters, whats the difference? I pray for the day I see massive unleashing of innovation to help the middle east survive the coming droughts and dependence on oil. @EcoWavePower @ISRAEL21C must be given a chance to kill with kindness. #microgrids #circulareconomy
3562 2018-12-04 18:44:03 You: I'm more concerned about the fiscal implications of shutting down the oil sands-
Me: *slaps you hard in the fucking face*
3563 2018-12-04 18:44:00 I guess it would be helpful to know who the donors are. Oil industry “employee” includes a wide variety of people.
3564 2018-12-04 18:43:58 Does uh

Does the rest of the country also have Alaska’s teensy population and also sit on massive oil fields
3565 2018-12-04 18:43:38 The motor oil for sure!! lol

3567 2018-12-04 18:43:36 @theturner I am a producer at CBC. Hoping you might be available to come on today 7 pm ET. To talk about oil patch and sustainability. Could you do. Studio or FaceTime/Skype. Please get back to me ASAP.
3568 2018-12-04 18:43:26 Yeah well when oil is booming, and the rich get richer, no one has pity on my gasoline costs. Sorry not sorry
3569 2018-12-04 18:43:16 Sana oil good night
3570 2018-12-04 18:43:14 The only things of value they have are oil and guns.
When they run out of money, all they can do is try taking someone elses.
3571 2018-12-04 18:43:14 @Slash Here in Germany, politicians in Berlin have levied 4-5 difference taxes on crude oil in recen years, although only a maximum of one to two taxes on crude oil may be levied by law.
3572 2018-12-04 18:43:10 Down 800p now. Just the start. Dollar is going with it in 2019. 2019 is year of Gold. Oil and gas probably also because of weak dollar.
3573 2018-12-04 18:43:10 Headdesk. The only Al Gore proved is he’s a hypocrite swimming in oil money.
3574 2018-12-04 18:43:08 Oil prices run by Shadow people 
3575 2018-12-04 18:43:01 @ConradMBlack Please do this country a service and write a book about PET, PET Jr, PET's papa vs the energy sector including their investment exploits and history with the oil company, the gas station chain, middle east associates...
3576 2018-12-04 18:42:53 The donations are from gas/oil industry employees. Being that Texas has so many oil/gas jobs, this data makes perfect sense.
3577 2018-12-04 18:42:52 Thinking maybe vegetable oil
3578 2018-12-04 18:42:43 We Don't NEED or Want Blood Money from Saudi Arabia!  We don't need their Oil either!  It's only 14% of what we get
3579 2018-12-04 18:42:36 Get a bottle of hemani's coconut oil, so light and smells yum
3580 2018-12-04 18:42:34 I just spent $200 when initially I went to go get an oil change  my car is driving so smooth now tho
3581 2018-12-04 18:42:29 I mean I can't claim authorship - it's a pretty classic pilaf method (though that would usually include butter or oil), but it has worked for me literally every time, from 1 cup to rice for 50 ppl (give a few more mins for a huge pot)
3582 2018-12-04 18:42:22 Ditch Saudi oil and let's start utilizing Alaska
3583 2018-12-04 18:42:14 Write an article instead of a long thread of tweets which allows you to speak your peace but too short to fully support.
Is XTO an oil company? Don’t just dump raw info because you can’t be bothered. $2700 is nothing. What’s the point?
3584 2018-12-04 18:42:11 G.H. Bush Legacy: Oil company owner/Head of CIA /vice President /President. Attacked many small Third World countries (Panama, Grenada, Iraq..) leaving trail of civilian deaths and ruined lands behind. His legacy has only been matched by his son G.W. Bush who legitimized torture.
3585 2018-12-04 18:42:11 You just want war over unproven allegations by the CIA which would collapse the economy by them not using the dollar worldwide to purchase oil. Sorry the CIA agent got killed but speculation on the Prince is a foolish move by sheeple. Question the narrative!!!
3586 2018-12-04 18:42:06 How fast do fish oil pills take effect? Couple days of consistent use or first day?
3587 2018-12-04 18:42:02 we can all still chat:)
3588 2018-12-04 18:41:52 An excellent question with oil/gas at 7% of GDP.
3589 2018-12-04 18:41:45 So less production, oil companies will layoff staff, price goes up at the pumps for Albertans ( even though we get ours from SA ) pay more for gas, heating..all the same time paying Notely's Carbon tax, higher cost more tax win win for NDP idiots. Nothing to do with the people
3590 2018-12-04 18:41:43 #Saudi and Saudi alone will bear the biggest part of the production cut if it wants one. Skeptical that it can pull it off in current geopolitical circumstances. #OPEC+ #Oil
3591 2018-12-04 18:41:35 Bentonite clay does that for me as well.  I don’t usually dilute my tea tree oil but when I do for kiddos, I mix with a little jojoba oil.
3592 2018-12-04 18:41:33 And we Democrats should WANT to be appealing to individuals working in every industry - including oil and finance. Don’t we want/need to appeal to people across the spectrum and in every kind of job?The worry is that a corporation will have influence over a politician-not this.
3593 2018-12-04 18:41:30 Tiny Trump (Justin Trudeau) wants to protect orcas by running way more oil tankers through their home!?!?
3594 2018-12-04 18:41:30 Maybe the changes in climate are being caused by the microbes that produce the so called “fossil fuels” since we have just been through the “peak oil “ point too? That would of course make man responsible for the climate change!
3595 2018-12-04 18:41:26 maybe NOT thank them for "low oil" be minimum (when NOT true)

3597 2018-12-04 18:41:19 ahahah, I am a capitalist stooge! I hope the replies to anybody saying r.i.p. to Sherwen are going fine. for a person so interested in oil and mining I´d expect to find a full timeline on these matters. maybe you talked about Orica with some previous twitter handle, who knows.
3598 2018-12-04 18:41:16 Also curious how many of your valued, paying customers are employed in the AB Oil and Gas industry? My guess is a lot fewer going forward...but keep supporting that ethical/low carbon footprint Saudi OilThe misinformed narrow mindedness and hypocrisy is strong at Lush
3599 2018-12-04 18:41:13 Ugly Blondes - Oil and Wine
3600 2018-12-04 18:41:12 Combine pumpkin, vinegar, olive oil, cilantro, sea salt, pepper and cumin for a homemade dressing for topping salad or veggies. #SaludTues
3601 2018-12-04 18:40:54 Ted I am skeptical. I mean oil and strategic policy is more important than a human life, right?
3602 2018-12-04 18:40:52 4am. The deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Chinese take-out is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. Los Angeles sleeps.
3603 2018-12-04 18:40:51 4am and the deadline is looming. Forget midnight oil. Pizza is the only fuel that is being burned in this office. While all the rest of Philadelphia sleeps this poor programming team works hard.
3604 2018-12-04 18:40:43 Hey! What’s a little compensation from big oil and maybe some subsequent votes for a little offshore drilling despite being fully aware of impending climate disaster? Cuuuuuuh’mon, He skate boards. Some blood for oil!!
3605 2018-12-04 18:40:38 Individual oil/gas industry donations, oil/gas PAC donations, tomato tomato. Both are corrupting, and anyone who receives money from 'em deserves the scrutiny they get. At any rate, even if he's good on the environment, he's pretty bad in other important places, like Wall Street.
3606 2018-12-04 18:40:25 Midnight oil parce que :  j'aime l'heure ( pas l'huile ), les australiens et les chauves.
3607 2018-12-04 18:40:24 And that non-oil revenue you bandy around like it doesn’t include does include oil when you drill down. Customs collect from Oil and Gas, FIRS collect mad taxes from the industry. Ultimately, This is an economy that runs on oil. But you won’t know CoS you have been Atikukated
3608 2018-12-04 18:40:08 I need to find an efficient way to pack this coconut oil
3609 2018-12-04 18:40:05 Endless oil story
3610 2018-12-04 18:39:58 How long was this windfall,the same party paid some of our  debt with low oil price.pdp is just an acronym people make up PDP and those people are now in APC Oga.even the woman you support was part of the PDP govt u talk shit about
3611 2018-12-04 18:39:57 on each occasion the 45th president cries about #CNN being unfair, a famous mouse cries for mama #resist
3612 2018-12-04 18:39:54 The standard artisanal keyboard grease is made from a blend of cheeto dust and potato chip oil.
3613 2018-12-04 18:39:53 Boiling the oil as we speak.
3614 2018-12-04 18:39:48 But, but, but, what about getting oil companies out of government?
3615 2018-12-04 18:39:47 What’s a good essential oil for getting a million dollars
3616 2018-12-04 18:39:46 I hate to see that walahi

3620 2018-12-04 18:39:36 Thank you for your support! 
3621 2018-12-04 18:39:33 Yup! Water goes to the knuckle. Mom also has rules for not overstuffing the dumplings and how much oil to use in the wok when you pan fry.
3622 2018-12-04 18:39:31 Da meye?
3623 2018-12-04 18:39:26 Be like Peter Lougheed when Pierre Trudeau was in power, brought in the National Energy Plan and devastated our Provinces Oil Industries. Lougheed said “turn the taps off and let the Eastern Bastards freeze.” Maybe time for history to repeat itself?
3624 2018-12-04 18:39:24 They have been certain after the oil production cut agreement between Russia and Saudi Arabia
3625 2018-12-04 18:39:24 #PINOF10 dan kiss Phil's pickle
3626 2018-12-04 18:39:18 Except he doesn't. He campaigns against export pipelines for other countries to use Alberta's oil. And promotion of Saudi oil? You have a source for that or is it just something you assert because you don't want us to refine our oil here for our own usage?
3627 2018-12-04 18:39:14 For Saudi Arabia, the US’s chief ally in the Arab world, the past two months have delivered a stark lesson in how its relationship with Washington has been redefined by the Texas oil revolution.

@ft
3628 2018-12-04 18:39:07 Bad news, because we need a candidate who will force petrocorps to leave that oil in the ground at a massive loss.
3629 2018-12-04 18:38:59 #PINOF10 What was the most romantic thing someone has ever said to you?
3630 2018-12-04 18:38:44 Well if you were legally stealing Oil and making $50-60 a barrel, why would you want to cut production!! Fucking thieves!! And our so call leaders just let it happen!!!! Time for us to take our Province and Country back!!!
3631 2018-12-04 18:38:42 Instead of salt, use onion and garlic. Onion and garlic will make food much more delicious without salt. Or, use oils such as natural olive oil to add flavor to your cooked dishes and salads. #SaludTues
3632 2018-12-04 18:38:39 Thank you!! Lol I have some coconut oil too. I’m gonna have to try it out
3633 2018-12-04 18:38:39 This nasty crime has demonstrated the double standards we’re experiencing in the west. We (uk & us governments) killed over a million innocent Iraqis to deliver democracy!! And now we’re cheering  fat bloody murderers because they’ve some oil..
3634 2018-12-04 18:38:38 As in keep using the current line until it breaks and not replace it with a new line.. or shut down oil logistics to and through the state all together?
3635 2018-12-04 18:38:32 Yhu I have to win the Ndakana face oil and Purpul oil . 
3636 2018-12-04 18:38:31 Minister Sohi,
- Kill Bill C69, stop moving the goalposts to pipeline construction 
- Stop blaming past Gov’s for your problems. We don’t care.
- Build #TMX
- Push hard for #EnergyEast, get it approved, get it built 
- Stop bringing in foreign oil
3637 2018-12-04 18:38:19 All these shale drillers will keeping pumping oil though, as long as the price covers their daily operational costs. They already proved 3 years ago that they can stand more pain than OPEC can until OPEC blinks first.
3638 2018-12-04 18:38:14 Any Republican  who has invested with the TrumPutin GAZPROM, Kazakhstan Pipelines 2EU , Saudi/Yemen/Sudan Oil are guilty of the SIN of Ommission in the Muder of Journalist Khashoggi
3639 2018-12-04 18:38:07 Just think of all the pleasure your cookies have brought to so many people you have not met.
Then enjoy that burger - make it a double with fries. ( We call them chips - I bring them home and put them in a dry frier - makes them crispy and gets the oil out ).
3640 2018-12-04 18:38:06 This government is obviously the worse and criminally. They buy vote and do so so technically, yet come to the public to castigate others about such acts of criminality, henching on some snake oil demeanour to win the hearts of feeble Nigerians. Its such a shame!
3641 2018-12-04 18:37:48 To grow this economy rapidly we'll need cheap fuel. Lots of it, also why peg to the international oil price for local consumption?
3642 2018-12-04 18:37:42 Why we are Intellectual Hub they come to us for Intellectual service n in return we get Oil it's as simple as that! Free (Trade) World. Which is from 1000's of years when they use to came for spices for which we are world famous today also.
3643 2018-12-04 18:37:42 BBC Scotland has announced it is to hold its own Brexit debate. It will feature Oil tycoon Sir Ian Wood up against owner of fishing interests Sir Ian Wood.
3644 2018-12-04 18:37:38 @congressdotgov We The American People who survive The Bushes Administrations we MUST NOT FORGET, all crimes against Humanity&WARS created&committed by the Bushes Administ&Republicans in the name of Bushes'Oil businesses. 
with Trump we just going back&worse. Nevertheless,SAME
3645 2018-12-04 18:37:35 Yes I think it is, But Rapeseed oil! We had the pleasure of a Artisan Chocolatier rending next door one year, used to break blocks of choc at 2am. When she left it was like Hamlet after the pied piper left. Mice  every where.
3646 2018-12-04 18:37:34 Extra Virgin Olive Oil should be on these lists. It also kills pain. Just have to make sure it's olive oil and not tainted as many brands have been proven to be. But even cheaper brands on the shelf prove effective for pain.
3647 2018-12-04 18:37:34 Dave, isn’t there a difference between taking money from oil companies and taking money from people who work for oil companies? Do you see no distinction there?
3648 2018-12-04 18:37:19 It’s for sure a liberal strategy by NUTley, in a sense of shutting off the $15 oil and building up the price to re-market it. Either way, the price of our products aren’t going up until her and drama teacher are done their terms. Then maybe we’ll even get out resources to market
3649 2018-12-04 18:37:19 Eric, can you please do something about that weird oil that seems to be seeping from your face at all times? It’s unsettling for the children of the country and it’s becoming more and more clear that your father fucked a reptile of some kind to father you.
3650 2018-12-04 18:37:18 He’s a congressman in Texas. Oil & Gas is one of our largest industries. Shouldn’t they be part of any progression to sustainable energy?
3651 2018-12-04 18:37:13 Unfortunately yes. You either have people who work in the oil industry lose their jobs or destroy the earth. That’s basically what it boils down to. It’s unfortunate that money is the derivative of how the world works. The fact that the way we live relies upon the earths resource
3652 2018-12-04 18:37:10 gilet jaunes protest..gov look at balancing environmental policy&equity, backlash due to inaction, if we invested in renewable energy&electric car subsidy not oil,it would be manageable change..now poor penalised by effect of climate change &insufficient tweaks to mitigate #cop24
3653 2018-12-04 18:37:03 All very dodgy if you ask me. I'm a veggie and it annoys me that the likes of Linda McCartney food has Palm Oil as an ingredient. Go figure, whether its sustainable or not, they are in Orangutan territory 
3654 2018-12-04 18:37:03 Now to his poor grasp of GDP growth. The average growth of the oil sector (less than 30% of GDP) during Obj's tenure was 2.4%. 

The overall GDP grew at an average of 7%. Yet this man believes a sector that grew at 2.4% and which made up less than 30% of GDP was responsible.
3655 2018-12-04 18:36:57 I know! I hope coconut oil doesn't end up like this... we do like our coconut oil
3656 2018-12-04 18:36:49 This board of directors +ceos are tenderprenurs fleecing tax payers money from all parastatals with fuel, oil corporation energy related organization. When will DCI + DPP request president to have the ceos send home promptly for thorough investigation?
3657 2018-12-04 18:36:43 THEY ARE DOING THIS FOR ONE REASON THEY ARE GOING AFTER BEEF JUST WATCH ITS A SCAM FOR THESE CLIMATE CHANGE NUTS OIL,AUTO,BEEF ILL EAT BEEF EVERYDAY YOU BUNCH OF FREAKS
3658 2018-12-04 18:36:33 Someone at work just asked me if the big bottle of olive oil I have on my desk was a bottle of wine. 
They were dead serious.

I said, you know, work gets tough some days. 

And of course I got a blank stare in return, until I showed them the label.
3659 2018-12-04 18:36:27 I’ve rescheduled my minivan’s oil change three times because I don’t want to clean out my car.
3660 2018-12-04 18:36:15 Brent #oil + .66%
3661 2018-12-04 18:36:10 We need to go for prayers. Suggest a very powerful woman of God with plenty anointing oil.
3662 2018-12-04 18:36:07 Oha oha 
3663 2018-12-04 18:36:05 Also if Alberta willing to sell oil to USA for fraction, why can’t developer?
3664 2018-12-04 18:36:05 "Create Jobs"... they say that all while trying to end coal and oil jobs..
3665 2018-12-04 18:35:54 You're an idiot, read something, Nixon was found guilty of it, fined, it was published in newspapers, and he has never paid the fine.  Or are you suggesting that because I don't know an oil worker they don't exist?
3666 2018-12-04 18:35:50 Hi there! Norway here! 
Our politicians are spending our money like drunken sailors and only reason for our wealth is our oil and profitable warcrimes in the middle east with Clintons and Obama, not socialism.

Power corrupts, we’re all better off with less government.
3667 2018-12-04 18:35:47 I just applied Almond oil.
3668 2018-12-04 18:35:46 Balang araw magiging kilala rin akong youtuber!
3669 2018-12-04 18:35:45 Scheduled my nail appointment 2 hours after my oil change cuz they ALWAYS take forever here 
3670 2018-12-04 18:35:40 We love you "Oil Tot" and we are going to give you as much emotional support that is needed to continue to see you walk on that road to recovery. But to be fair it's going to take days to weeks to start feeling a full effect so please be patient. Your body is soft and tender! 
3671 2018-12-04 18:35:39 You mean the Ian Wood that told us the oil was running out?  Not sure he can be trusted.
3672 2018-12-04 18:35:35 I wish I had the answer to that question. Our own government does it as well. Making room for cattle,mining & oil 
3673 2018-12-04 18:35:30 Sasol does not make biofuels and its share price reflect the low oil price too. Economics works and non profitable decisions always cost

Бля, откуда у меня в заметках этот текст?
3675 2018-12-04 18:35:28 There is no feasible alternative to oil and gas right now.  Fusion is probably a couple of generations away.
3676 2018-12-04 18:35:23 プロテインみかん味くっっそまずい…
3677 2018-12-04 18:35:23 You know what the Saudi vote at the OPEC meeting will be. (Politically) they have the incentive to not cut; MBS got let off the hook by Trump. If he influences his oil minster to cut, Then he loses the political good- will. Not that it matters, Trump is full of shit anyway. #OOTT
3678 2018-12-04 18:35:23 The same happened to the Independence vote for Scotland though. They said the oil was running dry then a month after the vote, surprisingly enough loads of oil was found. But  when the Scottish government asked for a second vote Westminster said nah it was a one time thing.
3679 2018-12-04 18:35:23 The oil is already overpriced.
3680 2018-12-04 18:35:21 Have you ever tried medical marijuana oil?
3681 2018-12-04 18:35:10 I normally pay bout $70 for my oil change but they just blessed me and said $50 
3682 2018-12-04 18:35:07 Australia...the only country that celebrates turning an oil refinery into a fuel storage facility for imported fuel from the resource rich country....Singapore...third world thinking.
3683 2018-12-04 18:35:04 I agreeee. I dyed my hair and it was just refusing to absorb any moisture but the Milk and Honey cream combined with the castor oil was magical.
3684 2018-12-04 18:34:52 Tried to be a good daughter and made the family’s butter based garlic bread in addition to my own avocado oil garlic bread. Spilled the entire bowl of garlic butter on my winter jacket and didn’t realize how pungent the smell was until right now on a crowded bus. Shoot me
3685 2018-12-04 18:34:45 Aloe vera gel and tea oil work for me.
3686 2018-12-04 18:34:41 Seattle Grinders? They grind coffee, they grind marijuana and at times they grind our gears for opposing our oil industry  I think it would be perfect! #NHLSeattle
3687 2018-12-04 18:34:35 Yes lot vacancies exists in Bengal. However those jobs are offered to Hindi people who either live Bengal or from other Hindi states. We  take up the issue stongly and have to follow up with individual company or GOI, PSU offic. In Oil sect only Mgt staff of Hindi origin get jobs
3688 2018-12-04 18:34:31 So while I know low oil prices are bad for our economy, how do you garner public support to cause oil/gas prices to rise?
3689 2018-12-04 18:34:31 I'm so surprised of my ability to burn the midnight oil just to do my revision (and ofc tgt with scrolling over my phone ). Lel. I'm an early sleeper youknowwww 
3690 2018-12-04 18:34:28 @abcnews Somewhat amusing to see how much u guys have grown to love George Herbert W. Bush posthumously-I REMEMBER how much you despised him as an an oil man & his VP Dick Cheney-whoa some REAL hatred for him! So u guys only like DEAD Republicans, huh? Moran is a real hypocrite!
3691 2018-12-04 18:34:28 It was lacking in vital contextualizing detail. You know the implication most people will derive from "Beto is the #2 recipient of oil/gas... cash" if you don't explain what you mean by "oil/gas industry" and show this number is a relic of receiving more donations in general.
3692 2018-12-04 18:34:24 why I make an apptmnt to get my oil changed (never do) come in EARLY, ON TIME (never happens) get coffee and i’m prepared w/ headphones & charger cause they be w/ the shits. They have the nerve to say “could you leave your car for 5-6 hrs, 3 of our technicians didn’t come” IM HOT
3693 2018-12-04 18:34:14 So you see the good things, but you do not understand what Germany is all about.  The German gov. Allows the banks to launder oil money to support terrorists.  Lots of other, not so good things either.
3694 2018-12-04 18:34:11 Ted and Beto just came out of the most expensive senate campaign in history in an oil and gas state. That’s what these numbers reflect. You’re omitting context.
3695 2018-12-04 18:34:02 Call me when it goes to a motion at a policy convention.   And given Jagmeet campaigns against domestic oil in favour of Saudi oil I would can the moral posturing.   Your use and promotion of Saudi oil  over Alberta oil bankrolls that odious regime.
3696 2018-12-04 18:34:00 334
3697 2018-12-04 18:33:39 More reasons to boost US oil production. Tired of these countries thinking they have us over a barrel.
3698 2018-12-04 18:33:25 Thanks, my man! I really appreciate the kind words 
3699 2018-12-04 18:33:23 By that logic Sasol and all the other oil companies should be out of business because the oil price is below $100. This isn't just a matter of profit, it's also about securing the nation's energy resources.
3700 2018-12-04 18:33:19 @nabisco I love your cookies but unless you discontinue the use of palm oil in your products, I won't buy them anymore. They're not worth deforestation and loss of life. I urge you to do the right thing.
3701 2018-12-04 18:33:18 Oil de her head. That’s why she’s one of my favourites.
3702 2018-12-04 18:33:18 Yes o, thou anointed my head with oil and my wisdom overflow
3703 2018-12-04 18:33:15 Snake Oil?
3704 2018-12-04 18:33:06 He voted for offshore drilling. Beto doesn't care if my children die of hunger because at least Texas got its oil money
3705 2018-12-04 18:33:05 You late my guh I always gas up like every two weeks but I need a oil change like last year 
3706 2018-12-04 18:32:57 Agreed. 

@Ocasio2018 isn't someone who would accept oil company money. It's not in her nature.

Unfortunately, she, like most of the country, have been inundated with the oil company & short seller funded anti-Teslan campaign. 
3707 2018-12-04 18:32:52 I think we should be putting a large tax on oil and gas profits (not "at the pump", but on net revenue) to help cover shifting financial burden on insurance due to climate change which oil and gas heavily contributed to while lying to the world to cover up what they knew about.
3708 2018-12-04 18:32:52 It's EXACTLY the same smear he made against Beto. 0.6% of donations are from oil and gas employees, therefore he's beholden to oil and gas
3709 2018-12-04 18:32:50 To free the Iranian people and overthrow the mullahs terrorist regime, the US government should be more diligent and conscious in enforcing oil sanctions without waste of time. .
#IraniansWantRegimeChange
3710 2018-12-04 18:32:50 Oil barrel prices are a global mechanism, nothing directly to do with the USA or Trump, so it's not a valid point at all, and Trump can claim little to no credit at all.
3711 2018-12-04 18:32:48 "billionaire oil guru". In Ian Wood's dreams. He is head of a company that supplies provisions and similar type services to the oil industry, It is not involved in and knows fuck all about geology, exploration and  extraction of oil.
3712 2018-12-04 18:32:40 I believe that adjusted for inflation oil may b cheaper now than 1910
3713 2018-12-04 18:32:34 Due to International crash of crude oil prices, OGRA sugested Rs.10/ltr drop in price for petrol. But Asad Umer gave only Rs.2/ltr reduction. Sad
3714 2018-12-04 18:32:32 you would think buying a $24k car from a dealership would at least get you some discounts on a damn oil change lmao noopeee
3715 2018-12-04 18:32:30 I put CBD oil in my avocado oil for my skin  very softening, although not the most hydrating for my dry skin imo
3716 2018-12-04 18:32:29 It will be a real leadership test. Can't see how he avoids talking tax, oil...etc
3717 2018-12-04 18:32:26 Yeah. I guess I’m just saying as a native Texan that oil here is almost what the coal industry used to be in West Virginia. Can’t be too surprised when a candidate for statewide race here softpedals his criticisms of it. He was bold enough to talk about climate change ... vaguely
3718 2018-12-04 18:32:25 Yes you may. add only a few drops of the oil and not too much turmeric as it will dye your fingers. You can add some sugar to help with exfoliation

3722 2018-12-04 18:32:06 MBS has destroyed your nation honor and integrity if there ever was any with all your proliferated oil to destroy the Earth. Now you guys are more or a pariah. He's your Trump.
3723 2018-12-04 18:32:01 TBH I went round last night at 6pm and it was OK got a good look at all the stalls , Didn’t realise there we soo many mulled wine businesses in Bath… Oh and WTF is Artisan Rapeseed oil.
3724 2018-12-04 18:31:54 Silicon Oil...way too little 
3725 2018-12-04 18:31:54 He’s the second spot for 2018 because he collected more money, total, than any candidate in 2018, and any senate candidate ever. And a lot of people work in oil and gas in Texas, I don’t like this implication that they shouldn’t be able to donate to political candidates
3726 2018-12-04 18:31:48 And you can bet oil and car companies are pouring $$$ into campaign and private pockets
3727 2018-12-04 18:31:37 If not olive oil will do it
3728 2018-12-04 18:31:35 Much more. Russian oil. Mobile’s negotiator Rex Tillerson struck Russian oil deal, dined with Putin. Trump made him Sec of State with plans to lift Russian sanctions. And why did Trump leave campaign for “ribbon cutting” at Scottish golf course during Brexit vote???
3729 2018-12-04 18:31:34 Many Texas residents work in the oil/gas industry.
3730 2018-12-04 18:31:31 @pang: Thank you for your Saveur Sourdough Starter piece. Forgive my ignorance, but if I wanted to use it in pizza dough (my base recipe is 1/2 packet of yeast, tsp sugar, 1/2 c warm water, tbsp Olive Oil, 1.5 c flour), how might i go about that from Step 5 (or 4?)? Thanks.
3731 2018-12-04 18:31:22 If Rubin is saying, a pipeline WILL NOT solve the issue, I'd bet a pipeline WILL solve it. 
Remember $200 oil, neither do I. How about a shrinking world, nope?
3732 2018-12-04 18:31:13 Bihhh you gassing up and getting your oil change like you finna get on the hwy lol
3733 2018-12-04 18:31:12 To be even more fair, electric vehicles have to compete with a century of oil subsidies and existing infrastructure.
3734 2018-12-04 18:31:11 As oil prices goes, so the Nigeria economy. It has been since 1970 to date and has never changed. Show me the leader that will delink that reality then I will start taking all these “competent stealing” narrative that you Atikulators are being fed.
3735 2018-12-04 18:31:04 Wannan hanyar Ba mai bullewa bane , kada ka biyema abokanka masuyi ...
3736 2018-12-04 18:30:49 i been at the car dealership since 11:45 trying to an oil change. i’m starving.

3741 2018-12-04 18:30:20 This has already been debunked a bit. Nearly all of the money he accepted from the oil/gas industry was from individual donations. He raised so much money, he was #1 or #2 for almost every industry.
3742 2018-12-04 18:30:14 Idk about the Oil but tumeric and honey is enough
3743 2018-12-04 18:30:06 Clean car, full gas tank, and an oil change 
3744 2018-12-04 18:30:06 Damn right.  Snake oil being punted by charlatans is dangerous.
3745 2018-12-04 18:30:02 America was selling Standard Oil to most sides in WW2. Agreed, America never crashed out, they made money rather than freezing the axis fuel surply, not forgetting to mention the saving of millions of lives. It was a huge catalyst to their new world order. Nothings changed, yet..
3746 2018-12-04 18:30:00 Yooo  she better oil that scalp.  it looks raaaaw
3747 2018-12-04 18:29:56 status: drinking shitty coffee & painting witches & smelling of fennel oil
3748 2018-12-04 18:29:53 Curtailing oil production is intended to help correct a market imbalance that is currently negatively impacting govt revenues.  Not seeing your reasoning around having govt employees take a financial haircut because of this.
3749 2018-12-04 18:29:44 หมดแล้วค่า
3750 2018-12-04 18:29:40 When we deal with idiots we must ignore. How can an analogy about multiplier effect and to get your block head to undertake become a claim? Stop being stupid. Oil drove growth. You’ve not proven otherwise.
3751 2018-12-04 18:29:31 I ordered motor oil with free shipping yesterday at 1:45pm and it got here today at 1:05 pm wtf lol
3752 2018-12-04 18:29:27 For work wise yes, for food wise it’s beef lol. we provide most of Canada with oil, because of things like the pipelines and the oil sands up near Fort Mac. If there’s no oil there’s no gas for your car, there’s no heat. Ect.
3753 2018-12-04 18:29:27 In other words 
3754 2018-12-04 18:29:22 Agree. A campaign donation from an individual does not represent the industry that individual works for. This does not work for any industry why use it for oil and gas?
3755 2018-12-04 18:29:20 #PINOF10 What is your wildest fantasy? Lol (Dan, dont say dying pls)
3756 2018-12-04 18:29:09 プロテイン飲んで寝なきゃなのに…
3757 2018-12-04 18:29:04 You can exfoliate your lips once a week by using sugar and olive oil.
3758 2018-12-04 18:29:01 This is 100% BS. There are lots of oil/gas employees in TX
3759 2018-12-04 18:29:01 maybe running a centrist Dem (where have we seen this b4???) whose compromised by an industry literally fueling humanities most prevalent existential crisis might not be a good idea for inspiring voters?
3760 2018-12-04 18:28:59 6% from Oil & Gas sounds reasonable to me (especially considering from individuals), not half...I misread.  I conclude, I'm still cool with Beto! 
3761 2018-12-04 18:28:54 Nah, but I'm gonna do it anyways, my dude
3762 2018-12-04 18:28:46 寝不足で3日間の平均睡眠時間1.5hなのなんでや…と考えてたんだけど、最近ブラックコーヒーをペットボトルから直接ごくごく飲む所業してたからだ…
3763 2018-12-04 18:28:46 おじさんまで…
3764 2018-12-04 18:28:44 Yeah, it's raw rough-planed pine with beetle holes, then it got a coat of walnut oil and three coats of Watco dark walnut (coloring, not actual nut oil) rubbing oil.
3765 2018-12-04 18:28:38 Doug Ford: I voted NDP. 1) I've worked with members of TPS, over the years, and was fond of those I worked with 2) You don't have a child in the Military, that you have loved their whole life, I do. 3) Charles McVety is a snake oil salesman, not a Christian. NOW STFU #onpoli
3766 2018-12-04 18:28:32 something something motor oil
3767 2018-12-04 18:28:29 Feel ya. A lotion mixed with coconut oil is what I'm using too
3768 2018-12-04 18:28:28 Now add palm oil to it oh my
3769 2018-12-04 18:28:18 NOW: How is Texas making use of restoration grants from the BP oil spill of 2010? @TheMaggieM talks with Robin Riechers from the TExas Parks and Wildlife Department about ongoing efforts on the coast.
3770 2018-12-04 18:28:04 Context! Did you ever notice when you make a private donation to a candidate, the form asks for your 'occupation'? There happen to be a whole lot of folks in TX who work for the oil/gas industry @davidsirota
3771 2018-12-04 18:28:00 Change the oil sis
3772 2018-12-04 18:27:58 And of course, the endowment mortgages were recommended by IFAs.
Thanks to advice from IFAs we lost thousands of pounds.
Never again will I listen to these snake oil salesmen.
3773 2018-12-04 18:27:48 Itchy dry skin due to low humidity or whatever? Try adding coconut oil to your lotion 
3774 2018-12-04 18:27:44 @HARRISFAULKNER Then he shuts down oil shipments, till you forget about it !
3775 2018-12-04 18:27:44 Covered in Sriracha and seasame oil?
3776 2018-12-04 18:27:41 Nada novo ao sol
3777 2018-12-04 18:27:39 it mostly depends on your budget and preferences. i think regular oil is just as good but balm type products rinse off better without much residue (which can save you a washcloth). i recommend the clean it zero line
3778 2018-12-04 18:27:39 I started using a mixture of calendula, jojoba, and argan oil after I wash my face and my skin looks so luminous and fresh now. It’s crazy how much of a diff it has made.
3779 2018-12-04 18:27:39 Mai tsoro kawai
3780 2018-12-04 18:27:36 There is no good end of the shop bought scale. If you’re brave enough, you can totally just work with a pan of oil and a prayer. Deep pan. Not much oil. More room to contain minor explosions. Or I’ll get you one for Festivus.
3781 2018-12-04 18:27:27 "National investigative reporting" = you're claiming that individuals who work in the oil & gas industry are the same as corporate donations to @BetoORourke. So you're failing pretty spectacularly already, Dave.
3782 2018-12-04 18:27:24 Man just needs some oil paint and plywood.
3783 2018-12-04 18:27:20 Who sent me
3784 2018-12-04 18:27:18 Pipelines are the safest most economical means to transport oil.  Do away with them and you will have a mess But nobody ever said you were bright
3785 2018-12-04 18:27:15 And then you innocently mentioned these "oil and gas interests" all in the spirit of fun conversation, with no implicit criticism *at all*. And then everyone was so mean to you!

Yeah, pull the other one, bucko. It's got bells on it.
3786 2018-12-04 18:27:13 @ABDanielleSmith Unifor represents 1000s of Oil Sands workers - those being punished daily by Trudeau and defended by Sheer and the conservatives. Reconcile that.
3787 2018-12-04 18:27:12 Bigbaby Zaka ce 
3788 2018-12-04 18:27:09 #DougFord I have an idea for you. You build a refinery for Alberta’s oil in Ontario. This should employee 5 thousand people to build and run. Then Ontarioians can truck the refined products to eastern Canada. More jobs for the unemployed auto workers.
3789 2018-12-04 18:27:04 Let me go get this oil change 
3790 2018-12-04 18:27:04 Think it was @davidsirota and was misleading. Beto took the most individual contributions from oil/fossil fuel co workers.
3791 2018-12-04 18:27:03 And the reason? The Saudis opened the oil spigot full force. It's an attempt to buy off American opinion after the brutal murder of a journalist. American oil production has done the same but for different reasons...
3792 2018-12-04 18:27:03 Do you guys still use beard oil?
3793 2018-12-04 18:27:02 Getting new tires, breaks, alignment, balance & oil change ....is this.... adulting? 
3794 2018-12-04 18:26:58 I’m finna go to the oil field 
3795 2018-12-04 18:26:51 @ontarioisproud it will never happen.  Why? @irvingoil and the Irving family make too much money on cheap oil and they own the maritime's.  Why not put a 85 percent tarriff on all imported oil.  Irving family has corrupted the PMO's office for a generation but you won't read it
3796 2018-12-04 18:26:51 Broke a vial of tea tree oil on the bathroom tile floor so now everything in there smells like zombie hobo  

Such is the start of my day  #NextUpCutFeet #OMGGlassShards #AlwaysMissThatOnePiece

Hey ladies please help...
I got turmeric, jojoba oil and raw honey....
Is it really safe to make a face mask ... Please help me before I burn my face
3798 2018-12-04 18:26:45 Still don't get what most Canadians know. Trudeau and Gerry Butts are on the record of wanting oil to stay in the ground. They have no interest in helping the industry survive. Plus Trudeau family has never forgiven the West for telling PET to F Off!

3799 2018-12-04 18:26:44 Also don't forget structural subsidies like the pitifully small bonding requirements for oil and gas drilling, with the amount (about $10k) last set in the Kennedy Administration and never updated.
3800 2018-12-04 18:26:34 J’ai lu aujourd’hui que les russes seraient derrière le mouvement des gilets jaunes, que pourtant le Shift Project semble soutenir. Qu pensez-vous personnellement de cette théorie similaire au Russiagate quant au montant de preuves qui l’accompagne?
3801 2018-12-04 18:26:32 I don't think Trump won the actual election. Putin spent millions trying to sway the election w illegal tactics. Billions of oil money were at stake. Do you think Putin would have stopped at hacking the votes? I doubt it. Voting systems were vulnerable.Thanks to corrupt GOP.
3802 2018-12-04 18:26:27 The oil or water pump would be a fitting analogy but that’s boring
3803 2018-12-04 18:26:13 @ElizabethMay Alberta & Sask should hold wheat hostage as well I am sure we aren’t Paying Enough for Bread@JustinTrudeau Don’t Give in to BlackMail! Changing Oil Dependence is of Course going to be Painful!!! @ChantalHbert @CBCAlerts @jjhorgan @AJWVictoriaBC
3804 2018-12-04 18:26:09 Only people who donate more than $200 have to disclose where they work. And there is a list circulating of the number of oil company executives and board members who donated the maximum amount to Beto.
3805 2018-12-04 18:26:07 How can Wood claim to be a remainer, yet support a deal which is worse than remaining in the EU ? He clearly hasn't got a clue. And he's NOT an oil tycoon. He's head of a supply company to the oil industry.
3806 2018-12-04 18:26:01 Vegetable hair dyes are healthier. Cactus oil is good for dry hair. Stay away from sulfates. Is it NISIM or NHB? A hair loss shampoo. or closely related. What can I do to spot the true web address. Easy to use. A great find.
3807 2018-12-04 18:25:51 @maddow I'm big fan but, We all seem to forget or get amnesia about what people did, after they died. We Cannot forget all the wars created&crimes committed against Humanity by Bushes admin&Republicans in the name of Bush's family oil's businesses&Crimes against HIV victims&LGTB
3808 2018-12-04 18:25:45 It's not an attack piece, it just muddied the waters and implies something in the public consciousness that isn't true. Your headline could very well have been "You may think Beto is beholden to big oil, but you'd be wrong". And then go on to explore the data. 
Why not?
3809 2018-12-04 18:25:33 Babban baby girl
3810 2018-12-04 18:25:31 Anyone who compares Saudi Aramco to NNPC in the context of Atiku and privatisation is cynical. Saudi Aramco is a state-owned oil firm run like a family business in a monarchy by decrees. Now comparing that to a moribund NNPC in a democracy is a stupid thing to do. Believe me!
3811 2018-12-04 18:25:29 I got peppermint oil in my eye... someone send help
3812 2018-12-04 18:25:16 i've been washing my face with almond or coconut oil for years (before i cared about kin scare at all), but i hear people rave about the actual oil-based cleansers. is it worth switching, or is oil Good?

3814 2018-12-04 18:25:11 But I guess in this case oil is a weee bit more important for the entire world than justice 
3815 2018-12-04 18:25:09 4.5 Billion, one small step to socialism, one giant leap to destroying the Oil industry.

3817 2018-12-04 18:25:01 Let me help.
1. You wanna get those things cut nice and thin, thinner the better.
2. Get your oil to about 225'
3. Dump the Sweet Potatoes in the trash
4. Open a bag of real chips.
5. You're going to want to turn off the oil at this point.
3818 2018-12-04 18:24:51 They're as slippery has snake oil salesmen wouldn't trust any of them,but We'll done Andrea.

3821 2018-12-04 18:24:38 I'd bet everything that I have that if we had oil going to tidewater and a pipeline being built keystone would not be delayed.
3822 2018-12-04 18:24:37 Citronella oil 
3823 2018-12-04 18:24:36 I just know they gon get on my head for being hella overdue on my oil change 
3824 2018-12-04 18:24:35 Timing is weird. Seeking to pressure Saudis on oil production?
3825 2018-12-04 18:24:26 Me every time I wash my hair with baby shampoo, use baby oil or baby lotion.. 
3826 2018-12-04 18:24:23 $NBEV on a side note NBEV now follows $GUSH lol tickers look almost identical we now following oil? (CBDoil?) I knew alex jones wasnt crazy!
3827 2018-12-04 18:24:21 I just went to the mechanic and he charged me $45 to tell me I have an oil leak (which I already knew THATS WHY I BROUGHT IT THERE) then he told I go to nissan dealership to get it fixed.  Mechanic's are scammers on the low.

3831 2018-12-04 18:23:59 Now you've got me thinking that Tim's coffee isn't already oil, and I'm wondering what it could be instead.
3832 2018-12-04 18:23:55 Kayla seriously didn’t know you’re supposed to add a can of water when you make chicken noodle soup....her whole life she been eating oil and noodles
3833 2018-12-04 18:23:53 For what I know of it, it’s a certain type of coffee bean mixed with an oil (there are a few different ones to choose from) and unsalted butter.

3835 2018-12-04 18:23:41 Good points. That is why I advocate putting an oil company out of business directly. Then competition makes corporations more responsible. And the benefits of having one fewer oil company trickledown to everyone.
3836 2018-12-04 18:23:37 Good on ya. Gotta keep that brain working. I've seen a uptick in my cognition since I started and I have gallons of coconut oil on top of my fridge. The more the better.
3837 2018-12-04 18:23:32 You should read the book "The Arab Lobby." Arab states are able to influence policy through oil companies and funding for foreign service training, etc.
3838 2018-12-04 18:23:27 i have an oil cleanse question! ignore if you don't have the time :)
3839 2018-12-04 18:23:24  everyone from the car to oil to wall street is bribing everyone left and right under the table. They don't know what to do. $tsla $tslaq
3840 2018-12-04 18:23:20 Check out David Sirota conflating generally modest individual donations to Beto with support by oil companies, intentional and reprehensible misrepresentation.
3841 2018-12-04 18:23:09 online shopping for cowgirl boots while my oil gets changed, I need horses
3842 2018-12-04 18:23:03 Other corporations? He took NO MONEY from any corporations. That's the single most noteworthy aspect of O'Rourke's campaign for Senate. He raised all of his funds from individuals. $70M from US citizens. $429k from people who work in the oil industry. In Texas.
3843 2018-12-04 18:23:03 Before 12 AM shift....wake up hour and half before I have to leave and get a workout in. Then 12 PM shift wake up earlier to get workout in. Plus meal prep for those working days with black coffee and coconut oil
3844 2018-12-04 18:23:02 So you are saying donations from people who work in O&G fields are equated to support from Big oil? In Texas this must be half the state. I voted Bernie in the primaries, but now his supporters are just undermining any progress the Dems can make-shooting themselves in the foot

3847 2018-12-04 18:22:54 A barrel of crude oil was above $100 during GEJ and now it is far less than that.
3848 2018-12-04 18:22:49 They need to be sanctioned. Remember 9 Saudis were responsible for 911. Stops selling them arms and lets source our own oil we have plenty of it in the USA.
3849 2018-12-04 18:22:47 He was a good snake oil salesman. I didn’t vote for him by the way 
3850 2018-12-04 18:22:39 If I have learned anything this season, it's engineers need to work on the equipment they design, oil filters and grease joints in the hardest place to get to.  @oncourseturf @HectorsShop
3851 2018-12-04 18:22:38 Lol I Thought You Paid That For Just The Oil Change.
3852 2018-12-04 18:22:31 African black soap or the charcoal biore wash (i alternate) to wash witch hazel to soothe, jojoba oil for moisture . I also use the Aztec secret Indian  healing clay mask once a week nd nose strips. My skin isn’t perfect but it’s ok now lmao I’m sure what I’m doing is working
3853 2018-12-04 18:22:27 Guess it’s oil change time!
3854 2018-12-04 18:22:26 I mean that’s what this state’s economy runs on. There’s a fair slice of the tech industry too, but everything else relates to hydrocarbons.
3855 2018-12-04 18:22:23 We give her this joint stuff and fish oil erry day, but she got hit by a car at like 9 and broke a leg and got arthritis later  so theres not a ton to do now but help her move around
3856 2018-12-04 18:22:18 While I'm especially greatful for it, especially with my old car, I'm kinda concerned about what oil reserve was opened up or what restrictions were loosened to allow for this much oil influx. :P
3857 2018-12-04 18:22:05 
3858 2018-12-04 18:22:00 Stop your fucking whinging, Brian. It's really quite sad.

1. The province doesn't own the pipeline. Check your facts.
2. Government intervention is doing anything but "saving" oil and gas.

Albertans simply want clear rules from an independent regulator, the GTFO out of our way.
3859 2018-12-04 18:21:59 i’m like unwanted oil that slid into one of humanity’s pores a day before the first  date w/ the man of her dreams

Next week, Pep Guardiola quits Man City over links to oil barons and corruption.
3861 2018-12-04 18:21:45 Nice speech, waste of time. Big business/government are the biggest polluters not the average person, just the ships that transport oil around the world pollute more than all the cars on earth put together. If green tax goes on everything it’s an excuse to pay to pollute
3862 2018-12-04 18:21:41 #GeorgeHWBush was a corrupt thug, a misogynist, a bigot, and a criminal. Talk all you want about his gracious note to Clinton, but the fucker gutted the economy, subverted our democracy to steal the election, and started wars to protect his oil money. Keep your cheap sentiment.
3863 2018-12-04 18:21:39 71% of the ownership of oilsands  production was foreign, while the foreign-based companies controlled  24.2% of the sector's production. “Some notably Canadian oil companies, such as Suncor, Canadian Oil Sands and Husky, are predominantly owned by non-Canadians
3864 2018-12-04 18:21:35 An oil change 
3865 2018-12-04 18:21:27 No yopu will just drive them into Russia's arms ,and the two together will be able to control the oil markets.
3866 2018-12-04 18:21:25 pay attention and follow the money.  $1.5 billion in new taxes for "magical" formulas that cure homelessness, affordable housing, stops climate change, etc.  Surprisingly it all goes into the pockets of developers and advocates.   Miracle cure snake oil 2.0
3867 2018-12-04 18:21:22 Some girl on Facebook literally titled a video "putting oil on my feet" and I just had to throw the whole thing away.

3869 2018-12-04 18:21:21 Epp me pls. I will soon discover oil
3870 2018-12-04 18:21:13 So true, now it's all Trolls and Shills trying to sell Snake Oil. Shame really, hard to find a decent discussion on BCT and the new "Merit" system is producing uncountable stupid and patronizing posts just to get a rank up for doing nothing! Loose it...
3871 2018-12-04 18:21:09 I dont do all them chemicals in sprays and prefer things kid and pet friendly lol. Its a essential oil for everythang!
3872 2018-12-04 18:21:09 You mean the oil is virtual?

3874 2018-12-04 18:21:06 Последний месяц я думаю всё-таки с околофандомной деятельностью перейти именно к фандомной.
Но я боюсь снова постоянных этих внутрифандомных боёв пейрингов и мнений, срачей, а также "ты из фандома ХХ? Ой, фу, ты тупая яойщица/триннадцатилетка/отбитая/и т.д."

3877 2018-12-04 18:20:57 He hasn’t met an oil pipeline he doesn’t love and want to run through Indigenous lands without the peoples’ consent.
3878 2018-12-04 18:20:56 With Trump in charge I can't see a significant move towards reconciliation between the two. He is adamant to support oil and coal. EU is at least supporting #renewableenergy. That said, the USTDA did just grant #BushveldEnergy a $500k grant towards their #energystorage project.
3879 2018-12-04 18:20:47 Basic Income using the Ruling Elite money system is a recipe for slavery. 

They control 80% of all capital on Earth. 
They control ALL of the MSM Financial reports. 

Tariffs are not the horror story they report. Watch how they try to jack oil up above 100/brl =Crash. 
Qatar?
3880 2018-12-04 18:20:45 Ohhh well if you know of “several” then by all means, no women have EVER had an issue. Fort Mac has some of the highest rape statistics in the country as a result of oil rig camps but yes...”several” really cancels that out. 
#RapeApologist
3881 2018-12-04 18:20:44 Such a productive day off for me so far. Up at 7:30. Got my oil changed....payed some bills....went an filled out paperwork for a new doctor since my is retiring....seen Matt for his lunch break....went to the store. Now home to do laundry!!
3882 2018-12-04 18:20:30 It’s all about the oil.  Saudi’s can leverage oil against us to get away with this.  However we can cut off arms sales to them and force them elsewhere for less quality war goods.  So Saudi’s trying to appease Trump with lower oil prices as a compromise.
3883 2018-12-04 18:20:20 Undoubtedly individual donations from those employed by oil/gas industries. Not a shocker in Texas.
3884 2018-12-04 18:20:07 A 500% tarif on blood and murder and unethical oil, plus a crap tax of 1000$ a ton into Canadian waterways will help change behaviour and reduce greenhouse gasses far more than the tiny amount produced by Alberta. All environmentalists must support this.
3885 2018-12-04 18:20:07 But he uses too much oil.

3886 2018-12-04 18:19:59 Again, I know even Oyedepo your master can differentiate between analogies and fact based statement. But this is the year of foolishness. Go back to class. Oil drove Obasanjo economy. That is a fact . Not any technocrat.
3887 2018-12-04 18:19:53 As I said before, hope that this reduction in oil affects both BC and PQ and not the others. NDP must put pressure on PQ and Feds to build NB pipeline. Any more disaster and AB will be bankrupt.

3893 2018-12-04 18:19:09 This is what happens when you turn a blind eye to fraud and try to deliver on snake oil promises sold by charlatans.

It was always going to end in tears  - I will be heartily relieved if they aren't mine.
3894 2018-12-04 18:19:07 Oil prices soar and Wallstreet fatcats ca barely continua their glee.
3895 2018-12-04 18:19:06 Yes, Texas is exactly where you would expect oil executives to try to influence their senators.

3901 2018-12-04 18:18:50 Why would two oil companies want a competitor to produce more oil?
3902 2018-12-04 18:18:46 I Joe isn't qualified to be dog catcher. But I hop he runs. Maybe he explain how Obama thinks we believe he had anything to with Oil, Economy and Employment  we now enjoy.

3904 2018-12-04 18:18:35 Glad to see you're finally standing up for something that's right. We'll see how long it lasts. We don't need Saudi Arabia as much as they need us. They sell oil to anyone who wants it. Whatever is driving Trump's despicable behavior is personal and (no doubt) Russian related.
3905 2018-12-04 18:18:33 Coconut oil for everything I swear. Highly recommend.

3909 2018-12-04 18:18:23 The lionizing of H.W. is enough to gag a maggot. Plenty of people like baseball. Not all of them start wars for oil, try to obliterate women's rights, cover up a son's S&L scandal, crush a minimum wage increase, veto the Civil Rights Act of 1990, appoint imbecile Clarence Thomas.

3918 2018-12-04 18:17:53 The problem with trumpism is that it must be sold with a lot of snake oil. Trump is a salesman. He can pitch it. When someone such as Pompeo tries, he makes reasoned arguments that of course make the whole concept sound as silly as it is.
3919 2018-12-04 18:17:44 Big audience should know that electric car is up to three times more energy efficient compared to a combustion engine car. That’s because the combustion engine is always inefficient, and because the whole oil drilling and shipping and refining and shipping process is inefficient.
3920 2018-12-04 18:17:43 You thank and pray for a man who turned a blind eye about a murdered journalist. The Saudi’s lowered oil prices to take the heat off but hey, I’ll take lower gas prices at the expense of a man dismembered alive. Hypocrite

3922 2018-12-04 18:17:37 I have the worst errands to run today (get glasses fixed and oil change/car inspection) but it’s better than doing laundry?
3923 2018-12-04 18:17:28 global oil demand is only rising while we sit on the sidelines. Natural gas is the most effective bridge on the way to a world with no fossil fuels for heat. YOU KNOW THAT. Crude pipelines are much safer than the trains and now trucks they are sending from AB. YOU KNOW THAT.
3924 2018-12-04 18:17:27 It's time. No Beto (oil / gas lobby). No to Harris (putting minority parents in jail for truancy). No to Booker (big pharma). No Hillary (lost to friggin Trump). No Biden (made it harder for folks w/ student debt to declare bankruptcy and write off the debt)
3925 2018-12-04 18:17:27 It will only be a temporary repreive. Even if u buy a tonne, it will be used up one day, just like stocking cooking oil.

3927 2018-12-04 18:17:12 Can't help but think it also has a play in the oil market.  Gas is getting pretty cheap again.
3928 2018-12-04 18:17:12 ゆたくんのこと待ってたんだよ
3929 2018-12-04 18:17:12 ask him about the time he marched up in front of a woman at one of his 'events' and basically bullied and intimidated her. he's a snake oil salesman and a psychopath.
3930 2018-12-04 18:17:11 You don’t have any other arrows in your quiver do you? All you can do is blindly attack and espouse anti rational leftist policies. Why are they so upset in France? Why is their gas so expensive? Oil is ~55 dollars a barrel.
3931 2018-12-04 18:17:06 太れ～( ・ε・)
3932 2018-12-04 18:17:06 No, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that he received the 2nd highest donations from O&G workers.

While there isn't any info in that graph that says he took from oil execs there also isn't any to say he *didn't*. To say otherwise is to speculate in the other direction.
3933 2018-12-04 18:17:01 Climate denial is driven by corporate profits.

People want to save the planet. (Oil) Corporations want to sell as much planet-destroying oil as possible to maximize profits. They hire lobbyists, the pay for ad campaigns, they push for wars that will allow them to expand oil ops.

3935 2018-12-04 18:16:58 @LindaFoods Very surprised and disappointed to see you use palm oil in your products. Doesn't really sit well with your stop cruelty to animals message. Any plans to change this?
3936 2018-12-04 18:16:51 Health codes aren't written to support bring-your-own. I do wish all the coffee shops collected the used cardboard cups. Not recyclable (separating oil and grease from cardboard is impossible) but useful as biomass for heating.
3937 2018-12-04 18:16:50 Mine healed quite well because it didn’t get knocked. I did get a bit of a nasty lump on it when I ran out of tea tree piercing oil so stock up on that! It feels so odd when you get it done b/c you can feel it when you smile or open your mouth 
3938 2018-12-04 18:16:50 Then who do you work for? And why are you spreading misinformation about Beto?
He does not take any PAC or corporate money. Texas is an oil & gas state. INDIVIDUAL donors who work in energy donated to a DEM. This is great for the Dems. Not a bad thing. Why make it a controversy?
3939 2018-12-04 18:16:48 VENECUELA IS GREAT COUNTRY WITH WONDERFULL PEOPLE, UNITED STATES WANTS BIGGEST OIL RESERVES FROM VENECUELA , NOT VENECUELAN PEOPLE. ANY WHO SUPPORT USA IS A SHITHEAD AND MORON. SOCIALIZAM UIS THE BEST FOR THE PEOPLE.

3943 2018-12-04 18:16:15 You clearly don't know your history. Perhaps you should have paid better attention in school? Medicine was developed as an offshoot of oil and gas because the profiteering was unlimited. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to get that.
3944 2018-12-04 18:16:06 Cheap gas means low oil prices which  is bad f
3945 2018-12-04 18:15:49 Seriously though I have to wonder about the timing. Would not put it past Wall Street bros to delay sell-offs based on “hostile” political turnover

3951 2018-12-04 18:15:35 I'm really loving friend-of-friend facebook where I'm told i want the world to burn because I don't support bans on ANYONE who works in oil and gas donating their $$ to candidates.
3952 2018-12-04 18:15:32 Please find the Public Interest Accountability Committee (PIAC) reports for the past 3 years. It is clear that some projects supposed to be done with revenue gotten from oil do not exist. The money just goes missing. It only exists on paper. U can just google PIAC n find out

3960 2018-12-04 18:15:07 Way to disassociate from the system: Make your own bath and body products using ingredients like coconut oil, essential oils, and herbal extracts.
3961 2018-12-04 18:15:04 @congressdotgov We all seem to forget or get amnesia about what people did, after they died. We Cannot forget all the wars created&crimes committed against Humanity by Bushes administrations&Republicans in the name of Bush's family oil's businesses&Crimes against HIV victims&LGTB
3962 2018-12-04 18:14:56 Lol I be going to work smelling like hella Shea butter and coconut oil , my supervisor asked “what is that B&BW”
3963 2018-12-04 18:14:56 Nicely said, let us no go back to  cartails and empires, liquidate max of assets in the verticals particularly those models  based on recycling currency within Oman, no foreign currency or commodities. Oman oil has been overstretched with huge debts service.
3964 2018-12-04 18:14:56 Hindi porke bumababa na ang presyo ng krudo ay itutuloy pa rin ang pagtaas ng excise tax sa petrolyo. Para ka lang nagbigay ng permanenteng oil price hike.

3967 2018-12-04 18:14:41 If i have to do one more research on CBD oil at work I’m going to blow my head off bc what part of im not doing this did the president did not fucking understand
3968 2018-12-04 18:14:33 I almost killed my self today. But what I learned was that even through all that frying oil and water and burning my skin and face a bit that I can make a good tasting soup

3970 2018-12-04 18:14:24 People are like, "well if we don't use oil how will we do this and that and the other thing? Did you think about THAT?"
And like, yes. Yes I did. We will have to dramatically change the way we live. We cannot carry on living this way.

3974 2018-12-04 18:14:07 Who knows how to do an oil change ? Cause ion feel like driving to my ma house to get it done 
3975 2018-12-04 18:14:06 It’s That Bad Oil
3976 2018-12-04 18:14:04 Iran's Rouhani threatens to cut off Gulf oil. Frack him.
3977 2018-12-04 18:13:57 
3978 2018-12-04 18:13:50 idk how though maybe i need to change the oil or whatever
3979 2018-12-04 18:13:40 Oregano oil supplements!! They’re super gross but so effective!!
3980 2018-12-04 18:13:38 Simple solution: use an air fryer! Air fries taste better and do not have all the nasty oil. Give it a try!
3981 2018-12-04 18:13:32 Couple of things. 1) I do think that cannabis oil is a viable treatment for some conditions and science backs that up 2) I have always been a supporter of full legalisation.
3982 2018-12-04 18:13:23 Came to get get an oil change at lunch. White dude getting his car done too said he had an extra coupon for $10 off and asked if I wanted it. Still some good people left in this world.

3985 2018-12-04 18:13:17 There are huge problems w/ drilling and moving the oil to markets.

But there is little risk of earthquakes in the North Slope.

Alaska is huge and the active margins along the Gulf coast are far from the oil rich arctic.
3986 2018-12-04 18:13:14 The $429,752 in oil money is only counting large contributors.
3987 2018-12-04 18:13:09 Thanks for that ... and I do..however I’m not equipped to make my own oil right now 
3988 2018-12-04 18:13:08 Green Tea  or black seed oil definitely helps too

3990 2018-12-04 18:12:59 I have had every PlayStation product from day one ( except for the ps pro oil don't have one of them) and setup my psn before the ps3 was even launched. I even went to get a PlayStation tatoo but the tattooist wouldn't  give me one #PlayStationsBiggestFan
3991 2018-12-04 18:12:58 Getting my oil changed and this guy just repeated my phone number back to me like “four nineteen, seven seventy-one, eighty-nine nineteen” and now I have a headache. Who’s brain works like that? 
3992 2018-12-04 18:12:58 Why are we entertaining this argument? With this logic, then we need to shame every employee who works for oil and gas companies. How dare they make money off of oil & gas and then pour it into the economy and donate to Beto.

Sad to see everyone fall for the outrage baiting.
3993 2018-12-04 18:12:57 At the expense of future generations and the planet.  We still need oil and gas, but the world is moving away, why drag us backwards?
3994 2018-12-04 18:12:57 A gallon of water, coconut oil, & cardio are my everyday things
3995 2018-12-04 18:12:55 These dudes these days are softer than medicated cotton balls dipped in baby oil. They ain't throwing up no dukes....
3996 2018-12-04 18:12:55 It’s amazing how much better your car feels driving after you get an oil change
3997 2018-12-04 18:12:49 True but I feel like an oil corporation’s and Patagonia’s ethos seem like they’re at odds with each other
3998 2018-12-04 18:12:48 Resistance to renewable energy baffles me some days, the fossil fuel industry is not just going to disappear overnight if we start pushing more renewable energy sources. Oil and coal have other uses besides creating fuel/power and still will if we switched to renewables.
3999 2018-12-04 18:12:46 Oil money.

4007 2018-12-04 18:12:24 Mhmm! I was doing some research on different carrier oils. It turns out people try to blend palm and coconut oil to create a supposedly superior medium chain triglyceride oil, but we think it's better to just stick with the coconuts 
4008 2018-12-04 18:12:24 You are wasting your time with Hannity with this information he will never report this along with Hunter Biden and the Largest Oil Heist in History because Hannity is Pro Ukraine and Hannity just spews Propaganda!

4012 2018-12-04 18:12:05 NO, we will not cut emissions ANY more, than we have.
Our economy is shipped by gasoline, diesel, and bunker oil.
Ask China if they'll cut emissions.
You'll spend the rest of your life in a readjudication camp, breaking rocks, and reading communist literature.
4013 2018-12-04 18:12:05 "If 90 per cent of oil workers were female, Canada would be Kuwait by  now; there’d be pipelines running across university campuses, and oil  would be described in government press releases as “milk for cars,  carrot juice for jets.”"

4035 2018-12-04 18:10:11 I live in an oil rich area of Canada. The oil industry and their supporters are very strong here  It is almost impossible to have any rational discussions here with any of them.  There are exceptions-but they are rare.
4036 2018-12-04 18:10:08 Like da vapor I’m goin to cop more oil
4037 2018-12-04 18:10:07 The priority is to end all oil production in Canada.

4039 2018-12-04 18:09:54 Since more than 50% of all US oil and gas workers are in Texas it stands to reason that a significant amount of contributions would come from that sector.  The ratio of corporate donations to individual donations is the concern - in any industry.
4040 2018-12-04 18:09:51 Lol . After getting an oil change and paying my rent ..... all ima say is LOL ....
4041 2018-12-04 18:09:45 Andarko and other oil & gas in Colorado used $40mil to make sure they could frack near schools and homes. If you take that dirty money, @coloradoballet I can assure you we will never give you another penny.

4046 2018-12-04 18:09:32 4/ I was the spouse (now ex) of an oil rig worker who didn’t start in that field until his mid-40s, & now must continue to work for the company to ensure his retirement.  My 85k settlement was oil/gas $, & some went to anti-fossil fuel candidates & interests.

4055 2018-12-04 18:09:02 I can only identify oil, amongst all; and that too not sure about its type
4056 2018-12-04 18:08:49 How dare @ColoradoBallet ask for donations on Colorado Gives Day when they are getting handouts from Oil & Gas. What, @AndarkoOil isn't paying you enough? They have more than enough money to fight the health & wellness of Coloradans.
4057 2018-12-04 18:08:44 Did #Tumblr buy some random algorithms that were on sale? I understand that one doesn't search for the best extinguisher when their house is on fire, but one shouldn't pour oil on it either

4062 2018-12-04 18:08:19 Best CBD OIL !!! Love it!!! @greenroadsworld
4063 2018-12-04 18:08:11 Be courageous about your Telsa comments @Ocasio2018 and recant them loudly, please, otherwise you're just another oil puppet.
4064 2018-12-04 18:08:06 Put it in context please! I lived in a neighborhood where 75% work in oil and gas and many liked Beto and his positive campaign and sent him donations. What you are doing is twisting the presentation of the breakdown of the industries that donors work in.
4065 2018-12-04 18:07:54 Try using castor oil to help the hair grow out faster  it really helped when I pulled out my eyelashes last summer

4070 2018-12-04 18:07:34 Global problem needs a global solution. Impose a surcharge on every barrel of oil and ton of coal. Put all that money into an intl reserve fund that gets distributed to countries and industries that promote alternative energy technologies and solutions
4071 2018-12-04 18:07:27 And I almost forgot...what is the palm oil content in your products? For those wanting to know what wanton destruction of the environment looks like, google that - I dare you!
4072 2018-12-04 18:07:03 No farms up in the oil sands fields. Not like the government just missed the oil wells when setting the limits on production.
4073 2018-12-04 18:07:03 but fossil fuel is clearly a harm to our environment. if anything SA should take this opportunity to come out ahead and build something that is alternative to oil. Instead middle eastern countries spend money building royal cities that are unsustainable and will be left abandoned
4074 2018-12-04 18:06:56 genuine question: it seems reasonable to me that lots of the money would be from working class oil/gas employees. is that not the case? it’s a big industry there
4075 2018-12-04 18:06:53 Buy flour.....but no oil to make fatcooks 
4076 2018-12-04 18:06:52 Venezuela’s economic troubles are caused by being too depended on oil. This has nothing to do with conservative oppression that’s been happening in the middle east. 
Many other 3rd world countries like Brazil are capitalists and they’re not doing that much better!
4077 2018-12-04 18:06:45 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil: But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

4078 2018-12-04 18:06:34 He spoke often and loudly about Climate Change at his rallies and at fundraisers. Stop pearl clutching that a state with an oil-based economy has people that work in the oil industry.
4079 2018-12-04 18:06:32 I think it's more to the point that it's than oil company CEO maxing out to Beto. If the CEO thinks you're going to be good for his business it's probable you're not going to be good for the planet

4084 2018-12-04 18:06:04 Gold. Oil. Drugs. Sounds about right.
4085 2018-12-04 18:05:53 There's 1.4 million people in the U.S. who work in the oil and gas industry; 23% of those people live in Texas.

If we're going to impact our climate, we have to figure out how to bring that industry to the Green Revolution.

Here's a thought: Carbon Engineering

#GreenNewDeal
4086 2018-12-04 18:05:45 If oil company employees are giving Beto money, it is obvious that they are trying to influence him in favor of oil interests.  It still looks bad.
4087 2018-12-04 18:05:35 The first tax give away taken away is "Like Kind Exchanges" of depreciable assets Its a free giveaway and is a Barrier to Entry for New Entrepreneurs Also talk to @elonmusk and @boonepickens about Green Jobs yea Boone is an Oil guy but a Pioneer in Wind Energy
4088 2018-12-04 18:05:32 If that’s the case, they still have to take them all down gracefully, update them all and most Importantly test them.  It’s not a jiffy lube oil change ffs
4089 2018-12-04 18:05:32 To make sure all oil residue is removed, abandoned oil tanks must be thoroughly cleaned. Typically this means the interior is wiped down and all surfaces are squeegeed. The accumulated sludge and liquid are vacuumed into a hazmat truck and transported off site.

4094 2018-12-04 18:05:02 Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t another option to France’s diesel tax, to increase the tax on the companies creating the oil? Don’t tax the individual, tax the producer...

4096 2018-12-04 18:04:49 Reduce your debt, increase gold reserves,put tax on software import, increase oil exports.

4100 2018-12-04 18:04:41 I agree that we don't want regressive carbon/gas taxes--not alone, anyway. Consumers should not be suffering more than the oil companies and their lobbying firms that promoted climate catastrophe in the first place. #GreenNewDeal #GreenNewDeal4NYC
4101 2018-12-04 18:04:38 Korrekt, die Politiker, da sie das Gewaltmonopol kontrollieren sind unser direktes Problem.  Darüber hinaus halten Sie uns mir "Teile und Herrsche" schön am Rotieren damit Ihre Chefs ( Big Bank, Big Pharma und Big Oil) uns ganz ungestört ausnehmen können.
4102 2018-12-04 18:04:36 Oil lotion aur kia karun!!!??!
4103 2018-12-04 18:04:31 Good question. Do you know the answer? I've never heard of a state with neither property or income tax (other than maybe Alaska which has enormous oil revenue).
4104 2018-12-04 18:04:17 After #Skopje’s air pollution reached very unhealthy levels, the Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning issued a health advisory recommending that citizens use public transit or carpool, and refrain from burning waste oil, lacquered or painted furniture to heat their homes

4106 2018-12-04 18:03:57 I just caught myself I was going to question if AOC knows that the oil tycoons have been hiding free energy designed by Tesla decades ago so that they could reap the profits of big oil, but then I realized it was AOC and somehow associates free energy with ending racism

Also, can I send you some of my cbd oil, honey sticks, etc?
4112 2018-12-04 18:03:22 Wanna lighthearted prank to make your nephew quietly resent you?  Put a little bit of olive oil at the bottom of every glass of water you give him when your sister makes you babysit-he will forever think of you as the weird uncle who always drinks olive oil water
4113 2018-12-04 18:03:20 WTF do you mean 'believe in'? 

That Hanukkah exists? Or that some 'miracle' happened where the oil lasted longer than they though it would?
4114 2018-12-04 18:03:18 No, no it isn’t. Ugh. We are celebrating a war/oil/propaganda monger that was head of the slimiest most deviant organization in the world, the CIA.
4115 2018-12-04 18:03:14 I know what your talking about and that sucks. I know we like to give unsolicited advice, so take this as you will, but if you are in a state with legalized cannabis,studies are showing 1:1 ratio CBD:THC oil works well for ADHD and depression.CBD and THC together. It saved me.

4118 2018-12-04 18:02:48 i thought taking $ from oil companies and fighting against green energy was seriously dangerous, but apparently pointing out how that is dangerous is the dangerous thing. lol gtfo.

4120 2018-12-04 18:02:41 Cant blame Notley for world oil prices, or for the fact that in the last 30 years the Federal government developed no  Energy Strategy-no strategic pipeline planning.  Perhaps it was left to industry - sure got f---ked up!  Can't blame Notley for PCs decimating our Heritage Fund.

4127 2018-12-04 18:01:56 @GovernorKayIvey Ban offshore drilling. Offshore oil and gas drilling furthers our dependence on the fossil fuels that contribute to climate change (it is real).  But spills, leaks, and even day-to-day operations can also be incredibly harmful to wildlife.
4128 2018-12-04 18:01:55 I love when it’s time for an oil change, because I get to have back all of my car’s lost 5 horsepower.
4129 2018-12-04 18:01:51 I heard @Ocasio2018 say that climate change policies need to be just, which I interpreted to mean that the largest burden should be on polluters and oil companies, not consumers. I agree that a regressive gas tax should not be the centerpiece climate policy. #GreenNewDeal
4130 2018-12-04 18:01:51 Going to work in the oil fields, I see.

4134 2018-12-04 18:01:41 Sorry, but the courts, special interest and an inept federal government have disturbed the free market customer demand for oil. AB Government needs to counter-balance and provide leadership at this time. #abpoli #cdnpoli

4144 2018-12-04 18:00:51 Getting your oil changed regularly is a valuable and important maintenance action, but it's important for more than keeping your engine running. Fresh oil means less friction and a lower temperature, which means your engine can run more efficiently, and use less fuel.
4145 2018-12-04 18:00:47 Sirota never made any such judgement you are literally putting words in his mouth. The DNC voted to ban taking individual donations over $200 from oil companies and 6 weeks later overturned the rule. Why?
4146 2018-12-04 18:00:44 That's another lie. Oil does not earn 99% of revenue. And civil servants virtually constitute middle class in Nigeria? This is not a noise-making exercise o. You are out of your depth.

4160 2018-12-04 17:59:40 First of all, there is no planet - the globe is a lie! Secondly, since there were no dinosaurs (lie, too), where did all the "fossil" fuels come from? The trees? There are so many lies around the "fossil" fuels - very fishy!
4161 2018-12-04 17:59:39 Rhea do they not have any , how much oil do you use while making latkes : ) G-d it must be exhausting even tweeting though that much garbage
4162 2018-12-04 17:59:32 Yes clean energy is key for environment. It's starts with the oil pump in the ocean get that out!!! And no running pipe lines if 50yrs they will be old or leaking and not in use. Weather can break them open. Create more solar powered energy wind turbines wave  turbines engines
4163 2018-12-04 17:59:26 The Harper govt f-ed up the whole NG process, the town of Kitimat doesn't it want, the first nations don't want it, well... pretty much only the oil industry wants it. You get that, right?
4164 2018-12-04 17:59:25 True. But individual employees are donating to who they want to donate to. That some employees donated to Beto doesn't make Beto an oil industry shill, which is what the original tweet was implying.
4165 2018-12-04 17:59:14 Hi Diana, my flat mate and I have been recently cooking from SIMPLE and I just wanted to tell you how much joy we are getting from it- such glorious, delicious recipes that we make for eachother on a Friday night. Pages are getting lovingly dog eared/olive oil smeared. Thank you!
4166 2018-12-04 17:59:09 I saw a sermon the other day that likened the church today to a company that mistakes its method for its mission. The same holds here: those "oil" companies who don't realize they're actually "energy" companies will soon be left behind.
4167 2018-12-04 17:59:06 Haha, this is ridiculous. I am a lady and worked in the oil fields for many years. Yes, things happen, and to both sexes. But I have NEVER felt threatened or scared. I have actually had great experience with the men showing me nothing but respect. Ps: i see no racism in this!
4168 2018-12-04 17:59:01 Tighten? The US is constantly threatening India with sanctions because they buy superior Russian weapons and still buy Iranian oil.

4173 2018-12-04 17:58:52 The DNC voted to ban individual donations from oil such as this and 6 weeks later voted to reverse course. Why is that?
4174 2018-12-04 17:58:29 We've read them and they are full of anecdotal stories at best and outright snake oil at worst. And not one single peer-reviewed scientific study.

4176 2018-12-04 17:58:22 @BobCorker: "The amount of equipment they're buying isn't anywhere near -- not even close to the numbers that have been laid out -- Saudi Arabia does what it does with oil and with Iran, it does what's in its best interests"
4177 2018-12-04 17:58:22 The Oil industry ll probably remain Oily for the foreseeable future..!
4178 2018-12-04 17:57:58 why do we want to remain beholden to middle eastern countries and oil?  i'll never understand this.  we have the technology and intelligence and ability to find clean solutions that will work...seriously blows my mind to keep things status quo given what we now know RE climate
4179 2018-12-04 17:57:48 What gets me is he even states it publicly and on TV that he wants to phase out the oil sands. No body cares.
4180 2018-12-04 17:57:36 Not with a world oil price below $100. you can do anything you want to but if it doesn’t pay everyone will be poorer.
4181 2018-12-04 17:57:33 J’espère que ça vient après des bases en maths et en économie pour comprendre comment le monde tourne et éviter de se faire embrigader par tous les vendeurs de snake oil de la terre
4182 2018-12-04 17:57:33 @NoonerPodcast oregano oil is expensive because of rubes who will overpay for it.

4191 2018-12-04 17:56:10 Your "job" is not a productive "job." You create nothing of value thus deserve nothing, unlike the "robber" barons, who the gave us oil, gas and steel (ie longer life, heath, reading, etc).

4193 2018-12-04 17:55:57 Keep increasing the rates and fast Poloz. Don't give the impact of your rate hikes time to filter through the economy so you can gather information and properly asses it's impact. Mortgage stresstest % and rate hikes makes sense in this current environment of layoffs and low oil
4194 2018-12-04 17:55:51 Our work is never done. We cannot develop one energy technology to the exclusion of others. Oil companies grew into government because they ran out of room to grow in the markets. To get them out of government, and make room for alternatives, we have to put one out of business.

4200 2018-12-04 17:55:19 My point being that is usually an argument applied to states that do not have Wells or Refineries that are higher than OK because of Transportation costs. That's not the case in CA. As one oil exec said years ago. "The price in California is higher because they will pay it"
4201 2018-12-04 17:55:18 Fed slowing down and oil inflation tanking with prices.
4202 2018-12-04 17:55:09 Taking $ from oil companies is an actual attack on environment & humanity.

As is taking from wall street or military industrial complex.

But they best stop using charged & violent terms like "attack". At some point, we may have to physically defend earth from these scoundrels.
4203 2018-12-04 17:55:07 yeah I'll get right on that.From day one of civilization, Jews have been driven from their homes (Israel/Palestine/Spain/Germany etc.), tortured, enslaved, victims of genocide,Well now they have an official nation. Deal with it. Ask your oil rich pals to take in the Palestinians.

4205 2018-12-04 17:55:02 It doesn't matter, Beto still got money from the oil/gas industry. If it was wrong when Obama did it (it is), it's wrong when Beto does it. 

Stop creating a double standard.

4208 2018-12-04 17:54:53 Defies reason. "We're just doing hypothetical research where there might be oil. If we find oil, obviously, we won't press you for the right to drill for it! We'll just leave it there!"

4210 2018-12-04 17:54:45 Throughout the year Macro Thoughts has warned against over enthusiasm in markets and to expect global growth expectations to fall. I forecast lower US yields, recommended being long 5yr yields at 3.05, USD appreciation in April & depreciation in Nov & in Oct to sell oil at $73.50
4211 2018-12-04 17:54:44 There are solutions out there.....understand what you are saying, but I believe the transition away from fossil fuels is happening now, needs to be encouraged.  Some oil products will always be needed.

4216 2018-12-04 17:54:09 @JoeSquawk Really wish you would have asked your "moral investing" short seller how he felt about oil and gas.... He basically appears to short then tries to make people think they are immoral..... has to be the scariest threat to capitalism I have seen in years!
4217 2018-12-04 17:53:53 Conversely, how different is this from oil crudes? Nominally an effeciant global commodity market; in practice absolute shambles marred by massive fluctuations, logistic nightmares, regulations, trade wars and underlaying geopolitical and delivery risks.
4218 2018-12-04 17:53:40 Yeah, I'm not planning to vote for Beto if he runs (for now), but like you said, he's from Texas. Different rules. If he jumps into the 2020 pool and takes oil money, that should be an immediate disqualifier. I doubt he will.
4219 2018-12-04 17:53:36 The only way oil stays in the ground is not to use it and you don't need a government to tell you that
4220 2018-12-04 17:53:23 My mom uses coconut oil sometimes lol

4222 2018-12-04 17:53:13 swinney thought tax breaks were needed because Ian wood told us the oil was running out, but uk gov new it was lies. They new.
4223 2018-12-04 17:53:11 Alberta, the only place where you have to heat the bejesus out of the sands to get oil, cold ambients, compared to bubblin crude. 
Compare, to Texas Oil, that is, black gold, Texas tea. Where you don't have to heat it up.

4225 2018-12-04 17:52:58 Also, a lot of plastic bags contain fish oil (weird, right?) that make them delicious to cats. Jameson loved chewing on them.
4226 2018-12-04 17:52:47 One can only imagine your frustration. First it was Harper's epic failure to build a pipeline to the west coast then this project gets canceled. It's really too bad that Harper's incompetence directly affected Alberta. His failure to free AB oil will haunt AB for a generation.
4227 2018-12-04 17:52:47 Yup. Every since I took my son off all that medication he hadn’t been sick lol not even a fever. He still has a little mucus in his chest but the essential oil helps with that.
4228 2018-12-04 17:52:39 We did it in Mexico when I was in the Oaxaca coast. I forget what we were frying but I was amazed it was coco oil lol
4229 2018-12-04 17:52:38 It p much just tastes like half n half without the heavy dairy mouth feeling. Maybe a tiny hint of sunflower from the oil in it
4230 2018-12-04 17:52:38 I'm guessing it has less to do with fighting progress and more to do with Trump and his mates who have shares in oil and coal..
4231 2018-12-04 17:52:34 Cheerio’s, fruit smoothie with chocolate protein powder, and a some coffee.

Oh, and my morning vitamins: half a daily serving of fruits and veggies + a fish oil pill.
4232 2018-12-04 17:52:18 Increased oil tankers directly over the ring of fire where the stuck tectonic plate is. When it shifts - the big one occurs and a tsunami. What is the plan to protect all life in bc from the tsunami surfing oil tankers or is mass extinction of life acceptable? 

@NDP
4233 2018-12-04 17:52:17 Are you taking money from Big Oil, @Ocasio2018 ???
you need to RECANT on your Tesla comments.
4234 2018-12-04 17:52:14 Did anyone watch the world cup? Remember when both the Saudi Prince and Putin were watching the game? I'm sure Saudi Arabia lost oil after their loss to Russia XD
4235 2018-12-04 17:52:14 Spoken by someone who has lost the argument and is happy to be dictated to by Charlatans, Snake Oil salesman and those that seek to be the big fish in a very small pond. Do your research and look at the evidence - stew in your own juice but leave us out of it.
4236 2018-12-04 17:52:10 1/ One of the issues Americans have is working where they can get a job & earning enough to afford a nice life & retirement.  Some people who work in the oil & gas industry began doing so for the income & benefits, & enough Social Security to retire well.
4237 2018-12-04 17:52:03 Inyeh
4238 2018-12-04 17:51:58 You misplaced the oil well AGAIN?
4239 2018-12-04 17:51:48 Why not more sympathy for farmers? Alberta did not switch to non carbon based industry in time now revenues are down they are crying foul. Alberta we are supposed to be tacking climate change not making things worse.. I have sympathy for drought ravaged farmers not oil tycoons.XO
4240 2018-12-04 17:51:41 I also see cabinet didn't discuss about prices and fuel and cooking oil  shortages
4241 2018-12-04 17:51:33 It’s weird how literally all the white dudes who work for Marathon oil co. incorporated in Findlay, OH wear Patagonia
4242 2018-12-04 17:51:22 Finally tried #oilpulling today w/ coconut oil for 10 min  it felt less terrible than I thought it would, but I might try it with a diff oil next time  #healthygums
4243 2018-12-04 17:51:22 <1% of donations came from employees of the oil industry. If we're going to set those kinds of standards, we'll also be talking about the >1% of Bernie's donations that came from the defense industry and NRA.

Is that the world you want or would you rather talk about issues?
4244 2018-12-04 17:51:20 Except Lincoln would probably be for Medicare for All, reject oil money, and not cape for fascist regimes.

4248 2018-12-04 17:51:13 If you get an essential oil, such as young living, that is 100% pure (many say they are 100% but aren’t) you honestly cannot be allergic! :) just a little side note.

4250 2018-12-04 17:50:59 how often you supposed to get an oil change
4251 2018-12-04 17:50:49 On the other side the oil companies are stunned. And our pre-salt for whom?
4252 2018-12-04 17:50:43 Beto raised approximately 23 million. $429,752 came from oil and gas. That is nearly 2%.
4253 2018-12-04 17:50:13 James Baker's law firm, Baker Botts, represented both the giant oil companies who did business with the Saudis as well as the defense contractors who sold weapons to them.  It negotiated huge natural gas projects in Saudi Arabia. It even represented members of the House of Saud

4255 2018-12-04 17:50:08 Thanks @benbawan! I think it's because it's seen as the last straw. Real wages aren't rising, but oil prices are, and the fuel tax makes that worse. It's tough for ppl who need to commute by car and are already struggling to make ends meet
4256 2018-12-04 17:49:59 A lot of people are saying these are just individual donations from people who happen to work for the oil/gas industry. Ok. So what if it had been a bunch of individual donations from people who happen to be members of the KKK? Would that be irrelevant?
4257 2018-12-04 17:49:53 But sure, gotta build pipelines, transport dirty oil, keep supporting cancerous industries just to make a quick buck and keep up the GDP. We might as well watch a plane crash in slow motion
4258 2018-12-04 17:49:46 I used to like the hemp body shop cream but its ok to use vitamin e cream and baby oil together.
4259 2018-12-04 17:49:44 It is more brazen now, but there was a grow-oil-at-all-costs thread all the way back to Koch senior’s Birch society. I would not put too much stock into anything Nixon did; was the EPA just another lie? Why not a general law against pollution? Why not freedom from pollution?
4260 2018-12-04 17:49:41 New IF routine M-F. Black coffee and water until 1PM. Then bone broth with @Onnit MCT oil. Huge salad for dinner. Ketones pumping and feeling great.
4261 2018-12-04 17:49:40 I'd lobby congress for tax breaks but my silver spoon/oil well/coal mine went missing.
4262 2018-12-04 17:49:38 but is that because of taxes or because there's no revenue potential right now with oil prices so low?
4263 2018-12-04 17:49:31 Cyber ops? Or soldiers killing soldiers ops? It matters.  I'm not going to put my fist up in the air to see more young men and women die for idiotic ideologies - that means both sides.  We want the oil.  We want control over the M.E. resources.  It's silly. They're humans too.

4266 2018-12-04 17:49:20 Rogers says plan for oil spills inadequate, could be catastrophic. Coady says good record over 30 years. If something  needs to be done prepared for policy direction.
4267 2018-12-04 17:49:12 That may be less true for gas than oil, as there is a much bigger gap between production and consumption.

4271 2018-12-04 17:48:40 Except it’s not true, unless you’re counting gas station attendants and fuel truck drivers as Big Oil. Do your homework about the facts.
4272 2018-12-04 17:48:34 He’s not stupid. He did this purposely as do all the other “Progressive” outlets. TYT etc. In Texas if you pick up a rock and throw it it will hit 5 ppl that work in oil and gas before it hits the ground.
4273 2018-12-04 17:48:32 Oh my how could I forget to tell you I was a big oil man back then
4274 2018-12-04 17:48:31 On the first night of Hanukkah my true love gave to me, some oil in a frying pan #HappyHanukkah
4275 2018-12-04 17:48:26 It does also say that one of those donations was a max donation from a top oil exec, so not exactly totally misleading
4276 2018-12-04 17:48:26 @KailLowry  I had weight loss surgery and one of the side effects is hair loss  I read CBD oil is the best for it! My order just shipped & I’m so excited!!! Thank you for making this!

4281 2018-12-04 17:47:49 NDP got elected in Alberta but couldn't do much of anything and have now flipped around to support oil since there's an election coming up. Smells a lot like Wynne's desperate attempts at staying in power.
4282 2018-12-04 17:47:34 I'm at the one off of 108th, waiting for my oil change. First time here. Everything here is like thin crust to me. No dessert pizza or wings. Cinnamon rolls are good tho.
4283 2018-12-04 17:47:29 Oil sands has a high cost to extract, so lower prices does not make it economically viable, as each barrel may cost as much as 18 dollars or more to extract.
4284 2018-12-04 17:47:27 Lower oil prices can't be good for them
4285 2018-12-04 17:47:16 Norway has a small population & wealth built up on oil which they invested in clean energy and distributing  wealth amongst whole population. They are also a lot more left wing than Neil Kinnock likes ie same views as Corbyn.

4288 2018-12-04 17:47:03 Problem is NOT THE FRIES itself but rather the same oil that keeps getting used over and over and over again for deep frying them in FAST FOOD CHAINS. Make fries at home in frying pan and toss the oil out nothing is wrong with that

4291 2018-12-04 17:46:36 This assumes oil price to stay above $60 per barrel. If it falls below $50 many US Shale would cease to be profitable and might stop operations.

Off course free food na
4296 2018-12-04 17:46:24 US Will ‍Not Stop Iran Exporting Oil: Hassan Rouhani*

The United States will not be able to stop Iran exporting its oil and any move to prevent Iranian crude shipments passing through the Gulf would lead to all oil exports through the waterway being blocked.
4297 2018-12-04 17:46:22 "Half wits", "sheep morons", etc. There's better ways of getting a point across but I guess that's the way it goes nowadays. We're on a brutal path right now and people still want to support dinosaur industries like oil.

4304 2018-12-04 17:45:52 Got from Amazon - it's the Stokes Select 38200 Bird Feeder, Blue. We use dried mealworms and blend them in a jar with a tiny bit of extra virgin oil before placing in feeder.

4318 2018-12-04 17:44:41 yeah. he basically conflates Oil and Gas industry donations which individuals who work at Oil and Gas donating, He knows what he is doing too.
4319 2018-12-04 17:44:41 If you can Euroize Russia’s energy invoicing, its liabilities (as USD debt slowly replaced by EUR debt) and its assets, that’s still a big deal. And Euroizing oil from RU/IR would be good for TU by making its import denomination FX consistent with export & remittance FX.
4320 2018-12-04 17:44:40 Last time I checked a lot of the farmers on the land that oil wells sit on
4321 2018-12-04 17:44:34 By contrast, that is not true of someone like Ted Cruz. Without oil executives his campaign would have lost. No question. He needed their money desperately. Hell, he didn't even print yard signs until the last few months of his campaign.
4322 2018-12-04 17:44:26 OPEC and its allies are working toward a deal this week to reduce oil output by at least 1.3 million barrels per day, four sources said, adding that Russia's resistance to a major cut was so far the main stumbling block.

4326 2018-12-04 17:44:18 The appetite for giving uneducated quacks and snake oil salesmen a platform as demonstrated by legitimate media outlets never ceases to amaze me.
4327 2018-12-04 17:44:16 OPEC has problems, and the reasons for Qatar's exit from the organization must be examined, Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Tuesday, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
4328 2018-12-04 17:44:12 Same people that say US sanctions to Venezuelas government are because they want our oil. Lefties. Killers, thiefs.
4329 2018-12-04 17:44:10 This is my experience in Southern countries, where olive oil is common. In Germany the salads often have all  those dressings
4330 2018-12-04 17:44:07 All I want for Christmas is a stollen made without palm oil. And for food companies in general to find an alternative ingredient to this ecological scourge.

4333 2018-12-04 17:43:37 Please go into more detail though on how Beto has supported the Oil Industry by way of his votes, would love to see your thought process.
4334 2018-12-04 17:43:09 We have to pay for our oil somehow. 
4335 2018-12-04 17:43:06 No. I think he is holding out for some kind of potential financial windfall from Russia, maybe a secret cut of an oil deal. It’s all about greed.

4338 2018-12-04 17:42:53 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani made an apparent threat on Tuesday to disrupt other countries' oil shipments through the Gulf if Washington presses ahead with efforts to halt Iranian oil exports.
4339 2018-12-04 17:42:42 The point is, the time and energy he invested in appealing to the public at large far, far outweighed any possible donation from an oil executive. That was the entire point of the campaign.
4340 2018-12-04 17:42:40 I believe that money came in the form of individual contributions from employees of the oil/gas industry. That industry is a major employer in Beto’s district.
4341 2018-12-04 17:42:36 I’ve been avoiding getting my oil changed for 2 weeks bc im not an adult
4342 2018-12-04 17:42:35 It’s almost as if the population is sick of fighting wars for rich assholes over oil.
4343 2018-12-04 17:42:27 Oil prices pared gains in a volatile trade on Tuesday as fears flared that demand would stall due to a trade war between the U.S. and China, and that Russia remained a stumbling block to a deal to cut global crude supply.
4344 2018-12-04 17:42:17 More snake oil for the HSN crowd.
4345 2018-12-04 17:42:16 I like it, but I am allergic to it and can’t stop sneezing. My farrier uses the essential oil to calm horses it seems to work on my mare, but I sneeze the whole time...

4351 2018-12-04 17:41:33 That's great. There's a lot death and destruction and inequity caused by the global oil and gas industry and corrupt military industrial complex. Doesn't mean I'd want a player making my business about it while I'm paying him to distract people from it.
4352 2018-12-04 17:41:32 But the President of France is Macron....what does Donald Trump have to do with the new taxes????To be fair to the man,he actually has tried to reduce global oil prices and partially succeeded.....
4353 2018-12-04 17:41:31 Despicable snake oil salesman. Preying on the need for hope of the weak masses. Zero intellectual honesty.
4354 2018-12-04 17:41:29 Oh, so pan searing steak in sesame oil and shaping the rice before plating it and applying two modest servings of balsamic orange makes me a prick?

4356 2018-12-04 17:41:22 why is there still oil leaking in the gulf? There's a 250 billion dollar plus problem right there. Quit dividing the country.  You're ignorant
4357 2018-12-04 17:41:20 Rub baby oil in. Very slowly.
4358 2018-12-04 17:41:16 so bale wala yung rollback ng oil prices kasi idadagdag naman ung excise tax

4360 2018-12-04 17:41:12 Guys! What’s your take on CBD oil... if you use it, what do you use it for etc
4361 2018-12-04 17:40:58 My cat is so stupid, she fell in the motor oil bin behind my barn 
4362 2018-12-04 17:40:54 I sent Beto $ & wondered where Big Oil was hiding? Seems ppl avoid mentioning “sacred & holy” word oil itself. Russian Republican United Petrostate point of power perfectly describes the reality. When finding out Beto running as Progressive in Tejas I knew he was running for 2020
4363 2018-12-04 17:40:53 When are you numb skulls going to accept that the oil and gas sector is fucking up the planet drastically and if we don't start reducing consumption there will be no planet for any jobs period. Wake up
4364 2018-12-04 17:40:52 @AskTarget I ordered 1 lip oil.  I was billed for 1 lip oil.  I rcvd 1 box of 6 lip oils.  How can I return the extra 5 without confusing my local store?
4365 2018-12-04 17:40:51 1. Why are you comparing flower to oil? 2. Farmers take their moldy/mildewy/mitey weed and make oil so....3. Liberty is vertically intergrated so they grew their own weed for their oil. 4. I’ve seen a liberty grow room,it looked great.
4366 2018-12-04 17:40:51 Yes, EP80 is stinky but it's thick so it sticks well!

In places on the Defender's chassis the oil-and-dust has built up to half an inch thick. It's still oily all the way down to the metal, and the water just runs off...
4367 2018-12-04 17:40:43 Bet u use coconut oil in everything don’t even @ me
4368 2018-12-04 17:40:34 Like, I saw him fold and wash his clothes. He ran his campaign such that his supporters could track his every step. Is it possible he had a meeting with an oil executive. Sure.
4369 2018-12-04 17:40:29 マテウス、あのおねーさんよくね？
4370 2018-12-04 17:40:22 ยังมีมั้ยคะ
4371 2018-12-04 17:40:16 SADA KE LIYE MIDDLE PARTION WITH A TIGHT BUN N 1 LITRE PARACHUTE OIL APPLIED ON HER HAIR..WITH GAJRA.
4372 2018-12-04 17:40:15 I try to condition once every 2 days and wash once a week. It keeps my hair soft and somewhat clean without getting rid of too much oil so it doesn't frizz as much.
4373 2018-12-04 17:40:13 I am getting so damn tired of these insults directed to the PM from Alberta, especially since the truth is the fault for this mess lies directly with the oil companies and, probably, the Albertan government for not reigning them in. The simps truth is the oil companies...
4374 2018-12-04 17:40:10 @CNN ugh we want the regular shows no1 cares if an old criminal white man has died really 4sure bushes just as a criminal mafia as donald george killed JFK stole ppls land by eminent domain 2build a stadium stole ppls land in 1930s 4 their oil
4375 2018-12-04 17:40:09 バターとかマーガリンとか知らないけど多分吸ったぜ。
4376 2018-12-04 17:40:06 Just wanted to point out it also depends where in the oil company food chain they are. A CEO isn't likely to do it because they believe in the cause. Some one lower on the  food chain might be doing it for personal reasons. Just an idea.
4377 2018-12-04 17:39:56 I’d like to cover Quebec’s back and put a 500% tarif on blood oil and  a 350$ a ton cap tax on the trillions of tons do shit Quebec dumps in Canadian waterways. Everyone know that causes way more green house gas than oil sands.  Good idea Aamarjeet. Such a fair Alberta proposal.
4378 2018-12-04 17:39:49 I think you'll find oil and the lira are positively correlated most of the time
4379 2018-12-04 17:39:44 Yes lies and smoke screens ! Responses all coming straight from the PMO ! Their intention is to shut down the 3rd. biggest oil reserve on the planet !
4380 2018-12-04 17:39:36 O’Rourke’s donors were from individual workers in the industry (voters, in other words). Cruz donations were from oil companies & their lobbying groups. Big difference.
4381 2018-12-04 17:39:34 I went through this last night. I get them every couple of months, migraines are the worst. I used CBD cream on my temples, forehead & neck. I also use CBD oil in relaxing teas that use lavender & valerian (which help with headaches). Then I just have to sleep through it.
4382 2018-12-04 17:39:28 No.....  They don't have any agenda. It just so happens that their "right science" helps prolong the.oil industry's astronomical profits. Pure coincidence though.
4383 2018-12-04 17:39:18 Don’t let ur licensed providers use palm oil, it’s totally sabotages the benefit of #CBDOIL I know, I’m fighting a brain tumour w it, winning but CBDOIL should be made w sunflower oil ect..
4384 2018-12-04 17:39:16 Just so y’all know how stupid my co worker is he was about to put diesel in the hydraulic oil tank in the bobcat
4385 2018-12-04 17:39:00 For what reason?
4386 2018-12-04 17:38:47 I love how all natural men’s products are like “cobra oil tincture for virility and dick strength” and all the women’s ones are like “this tea will make your cycle sync to the tides and politely ask all of the yeast to go away”
4387 2018-12-04 17:38:47 This was a bit difficult for me to understand but my take on oil is simple most places that have oil are incredibly corrupt. Interactions with oil companies are consistently corrupt. Outside of Norway, I rarely see a nations oil wealth actually benefit the country.
4388 2018-12-04 17:38:45 That's EXACTLY why they're doing it: to hurt the cleaner car industry AT THE SAME TIME HELPING the gas & oil industries, who line their pockets. It's no secret the US is the #1 producer of oil & gas wells & pipelines are going in EVERYWHERE - gas pipelines threaten to destroy WV.
4389 2018-12-04 17:38:26 29MM people in TX, roughly 350K of them work directly for an Oil & Gas company. Countless other people in TX and across the US work for companies that support Oil & Gas industry or utilize products from Oil & Gas refining. Balance is important.
4390 2018-12-04 17:38:25 Ban road side foos telas who use sub standard oil for frying and ban coal tandoors.
4391 2018-12-04 17:38:21 This "Beto received money from oil corporations" meme going about on progressive Twitter is a distillation of what happens when branches on the right and left refuse go dive into detail and go for the outrage because it is easier.
4392 2018-12-04 17:38:12 France backed down on taxing oil.

Trump is still taxing steel.

But go ahead and rant semi-coherently about Hitler.
4393 2018-12-04 17:38:11 Makikipag joint oil exploration  pa nga. My kawawang bansa. Nakakadismaya.
4394 2018-12-04 17:38:10 Olive oil
4395 2018-12-04 17:38:00 Respectfully or not, you are not disagreeing. It is a matter of semantics. You say responsibility, I say existence. Putting one oil company out of existence is the best way to create responsibility in others.

4397 2018-12-04 17:37:57 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy.

4398 2018-12-04 17:37:45 I understand u
4399 2018-12-04 17:37:45 Looks like the snake oil salesman is blocking everyone who knows he’s a fraud.
4400 2018-12-04 17:37:37 Oil prices rose, extending gains ahead of expected output cuts by producer cartel OPEC and a reduction in Canadian supply
4401 2018-12-04 17:37:24 Oil like that family.
4402 2018-12-04 17:37:15 Exactly. Same with the oil companies. Out of all the oil producing countries in the world, the UK is the ONLY one that actually pays oil company's to extract the oil (and pays for infrastructure and decommissioning).  How stupid is that..?   An iSG would hammer them.
4403 2018-12-04 17:37:00 My oil supplied many city's and I maid such big bank
4404 2018-12-04 17:37:00 No. It means, ultimately, less non-OPEC production. Current pricing, in current debt markets, with current production costs, of tight oil, equals well economics that favour shut in, not higher completions.
4405 2018-12-04 17:36:59 يوم لا ينفع مال ولا بنون الا من ات الله بقلب سليم .the day children and money will be of no benefit ,except those that comes to Allah with clean heart.
4406 2018-12-04 17:36:51 The scientists you speak of can’t even get oil and gas money anymore. Like I said, they’re going the way of the cigarette companies funding folks like Lindzen.
4407 2018-12-04 17:36:50 The problem I have is why is it ok to paint all male oil patch workers with the same brush. There are pieces of garbage in every walk of life. I get tired of the construction workers are rapists and drug addicts narrative.
4408 2018-12-04 17:36:48 It’s complete fiction Solange. All donations require filling a field that indicates your employment. As you say, TX has a big oil industry and obviously a lot of oil workers donated to Beto. Sirota is being deliberately disingenuous.
4409 2018-12-04 17:36:42 See if I can’t oil the old swivelhips.
4410 2018-12-04 17:36:33 Shoot us a DM with your address, and we will hook you up with the most effective CBD oil out there!
4411 2018-12-04 17:36:29 We talkin like multiple types of fire? One brush, one oil, one gas? Or am I getting my hopes up.
4412 2018-12-04 17:36:28 Oil was 50% of Nigeria's economy? Stop joking please.
4413 2018-12-04 17:36:24 @Ocasio2018 I feel eminently sorry for your manager who sits by while you show your ignorance for real issues that face our world today. Picking on @Tesla-a company that shows promise for the next generation's future break from dependence on foreign oil. @elonmusk while the real
4414 2018-12-04 17:36:24 I don't understand either. In the height of the oil boom how may Easterners benefited from it. As well the auto sector allowed for people to stay in there homes without having to move West. I'm sorry to say that we can no longer give out millions to aid groups outside of Canada.
4415 2018-12-04 17:36:22 File this under Things I Never Thought I'd Do...massage olive oil into the dry spots of my...DOG's skin. Poor old boy was itching 99% of the time. Now he just looks like a 1970's criminal and smells like really weird salad dressing.
4416 2018-12-04 17:36:17 Coconut oil!
4417 2018-12-04 17:36:15 Soldiers, stop fighting for the elite bankers; stop killing. Stop dying, say NO to war and invasion of middle east countries for bankers, oil and military posts.
4418 2018-12-04 17:36:13 Not saying the fossil fuel industry is good, but it's all they have. When you have 3rd and 4th generation oil field workers - That's all they know. And until someone creates other opportunities for them, that's how they'll survive. I don't know what you expect from them.
4419 2018-12-04 17:36:06 It's disrespectful that nobody I know from high school has reached out to me as part of their pyramid scheme. I like oil too
4420 2018-12-04 17:35:55 My eyes were only irritated this time because I had swatched the James Charles morphe palette the day before  and yes i do used an oil remover :)
4421 2018-12-04 17:35:37 Had to stop putting that gel on my edges and accept my hair for how it is. I apply water and coconut oil and call it a day
4422 2018-12-04 17:35:36 I'm literally dripping in coconut oil and aloe vera. Plus I got a clay mask on and my sage burning. Fuckinngg cleannsee biitchhh
4423 2018-12-04 17:35:29 No  I was horrified that the CBDOIL I was consuming was made w palm oil, wtf that was told to me by a supervisor of a company. I’m not paying for something that’s very toxic to those of use w gut problems,no wondering I was vomiting it up. #nopalmoilincbdoil #LPS
4424 2018-12-04 17:35:16 How will the consumer know if all companies are legitimate, telling the truth? Make RSPO labelling mandatory for the consumer. I am boycotting #palm oil products for now so I know for sure. I've emailed some of the top perpetrators, Cadbury, Kelloggs & Nestlé all say pure as snow
4425 2018-12-04 17:35:12 Please give us a Oil Gap fill like in SPX.
4426 2018-12-04 17:35:12 221 Express Lube vacuums out your car as a part of their oil change service. You’re welcome
4427 2018-12-04 17:35:11 Seriously, the business model for printer manufacturers has to be the most ecologically AND consumer hostile business outside of drilling for oil in wildlife preserves, and possibly worse if you consider the vast impact of disposed cartridges. It is irredeemably destructive.
4428 2018-12-04 17:35:08 And @seanhannity, @BillOReilly , Rush Limbaugh and countless others spew lies and falsehoods that support corruption and  fear to bolster Republican agendas. These aren’t JOURNALISTS, they are snake oil salesmen! #CORRUPTION #FakeNewsMedia #LiarsinMedia
4429 2018-12-04 17:35:07 Flabbergasted! Just doubling down on his oil and coal ideas.! So i guess I’m really not surprised. Also hates that they really took hold in the Obama era.
4430 2018-12-04 17:35:03 I just told you oil prices don't mean shit, why are you arguing blindly? Go and pull out the GDP data. Show me the growth rates of the oil sector and the non-oil sector.
4431 2018-12-04 17:34:59 If Alberta's oil revenues are based on price per barrel for WCS for a product the majority of producers upgrade before shipping at substantial higher prices, then the royalty system needs a rewrite.
4432 2018-12-04 17:34:50 @OutnumberedFNC 
Oh Marie! your so beautiful!
To bad your a hateful bi@tch and DemocRat.
It's about who controls the oil in the middle east. Do you want the Russians making deals with Saudi Arabia or US?
4433 2018-12-04 17:34:39 Ive probably gotten 30 notifications from robinhood today about stocks being down 5% and im just glad i sold a shit ton (including some sicc oil calls) yesterday
4434 2018-12-04 17:34:29 a tariff man and a backstabbing  and a true exploiter that do not respect fair trade. Look what you do with Canadian crude oil  Totally unfair deal
4435 2018-12-04 17:34:28 You remind us of that continuously
Usually to impugn the integrity of those scientists who do not conform to your groupthink CAGW believer criteria or narrative apparently because they are funded by the oil and gas industry.
4436 2018-12-04 17:34:27 How about we shut down the #TarSands completely? Seems like a no-brainer to me. The choice is clear: Oil (and death) or Life? Is killing the planet worth a few fucking jobs? Where is your 
4437 2018-12-04 17:34:22 @mssocietyuk What is the point of Sativex (Cannabis Oil) being available if no one in England with MS can get it prescribed (you can in Wales) Consultant said as far as he is aware all requests are rejected. #MS
4438 2018-12-04 17:34:16 Liberals say that NRA money makes someone a sellout, but money from banks and now oil are perfectly fine.
4439 2018-12-04 17:34:06 @KennedyNation is on fire talking about Saudi Arabia, on outnumbered! A country that makes billions from oil truly does not need our help! 
4440 2018-12-04 17:34:04 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
4441 2018-12-04 17:33:52 How’s this an attack? It’s literally just saying that @BetoORourke is a slut for oil. You guys start frothing at the mouth at the first sight of Bernie lol
4442 2018-12-04 17:33:42 Hey @Schwarzenegger do you know your Kennedy family owns oil leases?

Sure you do...you just don't want the public to know

Stop all fossil fuels? You're a nitwit

#arnoldschwarzenegger
4443 2018-12-04 17:33:39 I am a crop farmer in Soutern AB and I do not support that statement from the NFU. I really have to wonder what type of "farmers" actually sit on their board. Their stmts are almost always the exact opposites of my believes. PLEASE don't do to Ag like you did to oil and auto !
4444 2018-12-04 17:33:36 Nationalize ALL the oil.
4445 2018-12-04 17:33:26 Oh they do it! My manager text me one morning after a heavy night saying ‘do you remember snogging that really old man last night’ turns out I was kissing an oil painting of an old man wtf! But the whole day I was thinking WHAT HAVE I DONE!
4446 2018-12-04 17:33:24 Except the original tweet is misleading because it implies that Beto would be specifically beholden to oil and gas, when in reality he got far more in donations from other industries, like agriculture, and he was the top recipient of donations from dozens of industries.
4447 2018-12-04 17:33:22 And now Jane has gone full eco-nut... The worst form of oil for GHG is actually in California, but you won't see the US ENGO groups protesting that. Canadian oil has reduced their emission output faster than any country on earth & are more regulated than any other country.
4448 2018-12-04 17:33:20 Looking for my CBD oil friends - please help me find you!
4449 2018-12-04 17:33:17 Aside from US adventurism in Yemen caviling to the Prince and his oil this is proxy war with Iran and that is dead serious beyond the deaths we are already facilitating. We is used advisedly. We the people put folk in office and sometimes they turn out to be dangerous to all.
4450 2018-12-04 17:33:08 I used to light up the night with my oil but J.P Morgan had to come ruin it with his light

4453 2018-12-04 17:33:04 @realDonaldTrump Sir, please consider reducing taxes on bio-diesel products made in America by Americans such as Soybean oil.  Many benefits;  American jobs, environment, renewable,  energy independence.  It worked wonderfully many years ago before the previous administration.
4454 2018-12-04 17:33:00 one time i left a bottle of olive oil at maria's house so i went back to get it and i found her gently caressing the olive oil while crying
4455 2018-12-04 17:32:58 Oil barons. It’s always about the money
4456 2018-12-04 17:32:56 I know that he blames oil suppliers for a problem that involves both supply and demand. He blames people who work for oil suppliers and people who invest in oil suppliers. It's the war on drugs mentality (focus on supply and not demand) applied to fossil fuels.
4457 2018-12-04 17:32:49 One other point to research. Tax bill created new purpose for Arctic Refuge coastal plain: oil development. Such an industrial activity has never been a purpose for any of our 500 plus wildlife refuges. Horrible precedent.
4458 2018-12-04 17:32:44 Totally unfair to expect these plucky, underdog oil companies to compete with the billions of dollars generated by Big Science.
4459 2018-12-04 17:32:38 used beard oil for the first time and now my beard is soft
4460 2018-12-04 17:32:36 Until you look to see who the individuals are, jumping to the "working in an oil derrick" conclusion is making stuff up. See Sirota's example of a CEO giving the max amount ($2700).
4461 2018-12-04 17:32:25 Coconut oil, the scent of your body still lingers on sheets
4462 2018-12-04 17:32:21 I need another oil plug 
4463 2018-12-04 17:32:20 So, the oil and gas industry donated money to the Cruz and O'Rourke campaigns? Why would they support rival candidates?
4464 2018-12-04 17:32:19 Dilumasi karo baby oil disit
4465 2018-12-04 17:32:19 Yep. United been playing catch up to city, board make moves reactively. Youre not toppling oil money and pep combo. We just need to regroup get a longer term plan down and then attack. How much longer will pep stick around? 3 years? Less?
4466 2018-12-04 17:32:19 Try being covered in black oil all day 
4467 2018-12-04 17:32:16 Canada's 3 primary exports: Energy/Oil, automobiles and lumber - all are horrible in terms of causing global warming.
4468 2018-12-04 17:32:16 I'm out of bread, and it's a couple days until I can get more. So I thought, 'Hey I have flour! I can make bread!' Buttt I have no buttermilk. Okay milk mixed with this kinda old lemon juice. Done. Not quite enough butter? Make up the diff with olive oil.
4469 2018-12-04 17:32:14 After you watch SurfaceGo commercial, stay on for  #NoPalmOilChristmas, banned on UK TV because of its political message, but pretty cool anyway. Made by #GreenPeace. p.s. Iceland Foods does not sell palm oil.
4470 2018-12-04 17:32:06 It's not hypocritical to currently use products of oil while simultaneously being against an aspect of how it is sourced, or stating a preference for alternative energy investments and research... Don't let them fool you.
4471 2018-12-04 17:31:47 When I take my car in for an oil change, I have the same anxiety I get when I go to the dentist. #PlsDontFindAnythingWrong #NotMyFavoriteThings
4472 2018-12-04 17:31:46 No, she showing you how idiotic it was for Sirota to hint that Beto was beholden to the oil & gas industry.

4476 2018-12-04 17:31:14 Coalition forces regularly breaking rules of engagement, regularly breaking Geneva conventions on "POWs" treatment, invading a nation on charges that were later shown to be fabricated, and of course killing a million people to build Mcdonalds and drill for cheap oil.
4477 2018-12-04 17:31:14 sounds good but just what are these jobs and will they be enough to replace all the petrol jobs not just oil fields but all the spin offs @ElizabethMay
4478 2018-12-04 17:31:12 You need to oil your auto-correct machine more often, Pedro. ;-)
4479 2018-12-04 17:31:10 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, and Medicare.
4480 2018-12-04 17:31:05 Bros, don't make me laugh abeg. How is oil price the only determinant of GDP? Go and download the GDP data itself and look at growth trends of both the oil and non-oil sector.
4481 2018-12-04 17:31:02 Aaa argh on and on.  Tell everyone again based on even the most optimistic scenarios wether the UK will still be using oil and gas for next 20 years plus. Is so WHY not use our own? You have no workable alternative as yet ? Not for UK or global that doesn’t destroy our economy.
4482 2018-12-04 17:30:58 It’s very difficult when the Tory Government constantly undermine and ignore our Parliament. I agree we need to be win the economic argument but we will be so much better prepared this time. Plus people aware of lies told last time re pensions oil etc etc by Tory/Labour

4484 2018-12-04 17:30:32 I budgeted $350/month for heating oil/furnace maintenance in 2018. Spent $306. That's my second complete budget line for the year. It worked, with a slight margin.

4487 2018-12-04 17:30:24 The same Nancy Pelosi that embraced GWB yesterday was the one who immediately put drilling bans on oil back in place when she became speaker in 2006.

Resulting in through the roof gas prices for years.
4488 2018-12-04 17:30:23 What @sc_biker said. Vape pen is small, discreet, no skunk odor, about $60 online and will last a looong time. Oil based is best for all concerned.
4489 2018-12-04 17:30:21 I moisturize with extra virgin olive oil before gettin out the shower... my skin is silky and i don’t get ashy the whole day. 

Good to consider since dry skin is common in the winter
4490 2018-12-04 17:30:16 Apparently it’s his step son and has asked him not to use the Wardak surname. But when he was getting multi-million dollar oil contracts from Defense ministry In karzai era it was ok to use his step dads name. Not anymore
4491 2018-12-04 17:30:15 >when you shut down all your nuclear energy plants and start complaining about burning coal and russian oil

seems green energy really didnt work out
4492 2018-12-04 17:30:14 Hi hun I have the sane prob in winter especially. I make a cream w/ shea butter, mango seed butter, cocoa butter & almond oil. It is whipped & all organic. I have one last jar left I can mail to you & it would last for a long time. I use it full body & even to take off eye makeup
4493 2018-12-04 17:30:05 My plug is a grower, I like sipping oil.
4494 2018-12-04 17:30:03 Yours is perfect 
So far is nt palm oil
4495 2018-12-04 17:29:58 Koch bros began their tenure at Koch Industries by stealing oil from Indian reservations. These are con men. Just born rich Like Trump, but smarter.
4496 2018-12-04 17:29:57 I can't believe Thabo died, i feel like he'll wake up like Lazarus.. he prolly needs that what what oil from PTA #SkeemSaam
4497 2018-12-04 17:29:52 Are you familiar with raw materials?

Copper, steel, zinc, coal, oil, etc.

These are all competing market products.

You’ve got to think beyond your phone, tv and car.

I sit at an engineering desk. I literally build things for a living.

I don’t have the time to school you.
4498 2018-12-04 17:29:43 I don't claim to know exactly why people are rioting but I I think it has more to it than just oil taxes( I realize that has a lot to do with it). Over simplify the entire situation. Watch how suspending the fuel tax increase only kind of helps
4499 2018-12-04 17:29:39 Gee, you mean I shouldn’t believe all the snake oil salesmen?? Glad someone wrote a rebuttal.
4500 2018-12-04 17:29:33 Hey #TampaBayEats: Been seeing CBD oil cocktails or dishes around the area? Tell me 'bout them.
4501 2018-12-04 17:29:22 Niggas love asking “CaN yOu CoOk?” Bitch can you Change my oil & tire
4502 2018-12-04 17:29:11 If you take every military conflict over oil and replace oil with coffee, it makes a lot more sense.

4504 2018-12-04 17:29:09 US Will ‍Not Stop Iran Exporting Oil: Hassan Rouhani

The United States will not be able to stop Iran exporting its oil and any move to prevent Iranian crude shipments passing through the Gulf would lead to all oil exports through the waterway being blocked, Rouhani
4505 2018-12-04 17:29:08 Nice reporting on the corruption aspect of drilling for oil in our wildest and greatest wildlife refuge with 70% of Americans opposed.  Now dig deeper on Indigenous perspectives (many residents in Kaktovik against drilling) and oil company perspective on lack of interest in ANWR.
4506 2018-12-04 17:28:50 do yourself a favor and take fish oil pills 
4507 2018-12-04 17:28:49 You literally just did it:

"Sirota’s tweet suggests Beto takes money from the “oil and gas industry”.

In reality, Beto didn’t take money from that industry or any other.

He took only small-dollar donations from individuals - who are required to list the industry they work in."
4508 2018-12-04 17:28:46 Would you consider hastening coal closures / reducing political opposition a public policy rationale? But yeah, I agree with you in principle. On another note, I recently had conversations with many oil field workers on a similar issue.
4509 2018-12-04 17:28:29 Every time I take my goddamn car to get an oil change there’s something else fucking wrong with it and it’s always something expensive and I AM TIRED OF IT
4510 2018-12-04 17:28:27 So if oil prices are low then people are paying less. That means they are saving money and spending the money somewhere else. Yet if the oil prices are high companies are making more money and people pay more for gas. There for there is no winning. People just like to bitch.
4511 2018-12-04 17:28:25 similar pattern last time oil crashed in 2015-16. #study
4512 2018-12-04 17:28:18 If oil

4514 2018-12-04 17:28:14 I found pure cbd oil worked wonders for all my past tooth pain.
.05ml drop and bam gone completely. I was putting it right on the exposed nerve too.
4515 2018-12-04 17:28:06 Let me know if it works for you!! Coconut oil naturally boosts your metabolism too, and is great for your skin, and your hair, and just life in general.
4516 2018-12-04 17:28:04 Remember the days when a GT or Sport spec meant more instruments, multiple carbs & an extra gear. An "M Sport" BMW is now sold with a standard 2L oil burner & a fancy grill.
4517 2018-12-04 17:28:03 Local, but they rely on fake news orgs to cover national and foreign. Find reporters you trust (good ex: @GadiNBC.) Find Twitter accounts you trust to help vet stories. Also, Miami Herald is pretty reliable, for the most part. 

(No, it shouldn't be this hard.)
4518 2018-12-04 17:27:56 He also selectively reported that Beto was top 2 for his Senate race with employees of oil and gas industries, while leaving out that Beto also came in first for employees of practically EVERY industry. It’s clear he was trying to say Beto was beholden to oil and gas.
4519 2018-12-04 17:27:55 Here are some of the health benefits of olive oil.

 Olive Oil Is Rich in Healthy Monounsaturated Fats
 Olive Oil Contains Large Amounts of Antioxidants
 Olive Oil Has Strong Anti-Inflammatory Properties

4522 2018-12-04 17:27:43 I need to go get an oil change ...
4523 2018-12-04 17:27:37 Лично я даже не в фандоме(ни в каком), я просто услышала, что у этого чела др, и решила сделать свой вклад в происходящее.
4524 2018-12-04 17:27:36 Could very well be because most of the flower used to make wax pens isn’t pesticide free. Smh y’all just see a fancy gadget and smoke the shits.... seen people smoke straight cut oil, mid grade concentrate, and even engine oil...  smh

4526 2018-12-04 17:27:21 I get that oil futures fluctuate but how tf does gas go from 1.94 to 2.29 in an hour...
4527 2018-12-04 17:27:15 Changing oil is easy. I did a major service on my last Volvo that required removing the intake manifold. 
4528 2018-12-04 17:27:08 The protesters are middle class French, and they want the government to use taxpayers money to lower the oil prices. So no.
4529 2018-12-04 17:26:51 Hoy tenemos un "cartel" OPEP&no-OPEP que todavía puede maniobrar en el mercado petrolero mundial hacia un precio q hace feliz a "todos",particularmente a Putin. Éste ha reiterado su satisfacción ante un precio de 60$/B,a pesar de que hoy el costo del Shale Oil no supera los 40$/B
4530 2018-12-04 17:26:49 Another Republican strategy to increase oil consumption at the expense of our ability to compete with new technologies. China, Germany and Japan are going to move ahead of us with electric vehicles.

4532 2018-12-04 17:26:47 Use a chemical peel and follow with a witch hazel toner (Thayer's is good/cheap/alc free) then a hyaluronic acid moisturizer. Sleep in a face oil, I prefer. Avoid make up for a few day if you can so you can just use light cleansers at night. I like fresh's soy cleanser
4533 2018-12-04 17:26:37 He didn't. They are donations from people whose occupation happens to be in the oil & gas industry. It could be an oil rig worker or a cashier at a convenience store that has gas pumps.
4534 2018-12-04 17:26:36 those little banks fund the shale producers also... oil

4536 2018-12-04 17:26:34 Which corporations are the greediest? Personally, I don’t like the word greed, because corporations don’t have emotions. What corporations do have is a tendency to grow. And oil grew so large they’re begging for euthanasia. Why should oil co.s have more pwr than honest new co.s?
4537 2018-12-04 17:26:29 Small/individual doners != lobbyists, even if those donors are in oil/gas industry. They could be employees.

4541 2018-12-04 17:26:21 How long has it been since you got an oil change?
4542 2018-12-04 17:26:20 Can u tell me your view on Oil please? Gap fill underway and when the Gap is filled, maybe bottom in SPX?
4543 2018-12-04 17:26:19 Need a man in the oil field so i don’t gotta see him everyday
4544 2018-12-04 17:26:17 well I guess i’ll go get an oil change today after my car reminding daily me since july

4546 2018-12-04 17:26:10 Some days I have difficulty keeping up with symbolism derived bollocks. So will just say "whatever" until the next time you sit with a parliamentary group to discuss Windrush, Millions of war dead & refugees we create based on "national interest". Kill brown faces for black oil.
4547 2018-12-04 17:26:00 The west now has leverage over MBS. Saudi Arabia will pump cheap oil and buy tons of weapons from the west.
4548 2018-12-04 17:25:56 Beauty products are great, but pretty pricey, so I use Coconut Oil and sleep with it on at night.
4549 2018-12-04 17:25:53 Use real tea tree essential oil in your shampoo. I personally use Young Living Brand.
4550 2018-12-04 17:25:50 Uhm, the protesters want the government to *react* and *control oil prices*, just in the other direction.
4551 2018-12-04 17:25:48 45 should be showered with olive oil, as he is the Demon in Chief.
4552 2018-12-04 17:25:48 If TX were its own country, it would be the sixth-largest oil producer in the world.
4553 2018-12-04 17:25:43 Dow Transports down almost 4%, despite oil still hovering at $52 per barrel. Not a strong economic message coming from the most economically sensitive sector of the market. With flattening yield curve, negative message getting more pronounced.
4554 2018-12-04 17:25:39 Real artists use oil paints to draw anime girls
4555 2018-12-04 17:25:37 Gil, remember you called me a conspiracy theorist for saying there was a foreign initiated social media deluge of divisive environmental/pro oil messaging?

I think I may have figured out an explanation that makes both of us right. 

Please consider below.
4556 2018-12-04 17:25:33 صح 100 %
4557 2018-12-04 17:25:32 I am shocked by the yellow vest protest: french citizens want free fuel but they dont have oil wells chai!!!! We donc suffer @BBCAfrica @France24_fr @EmmanuelFreuden @EmmanuelMacron
#African #Ambazonia is in trouble
4558 2018-12-04 17:25:29 The Vietnam War was illegal and immoral.  So we’re both Gulf Wars which were wars of choice used to get cheap oil and more military bases in the Middle East.
4559 2018-12-04 17:25:22 Beto received many contributions from individuals in the oil/gas industry because many individuals in TX work in that industry. Texas is the largest producer of oil/gas in the US. It has more refineries & produces more than 1/3 of total US output.
4560 2018-12-04 17:25:13 Haven’t seen an eagle jeep kit on a rangy for a while. Last one I saw sadly knocked the oil filter off :o
I did mount my winch to mine. It was fine :o) handy to reach the free wheel lever with it next to the seat.
Now it all lives on a sub frame because two winches were there.
4561 2018-12-04 17:25:10 Today is #nationalcookieday and get 10% off on Tea Rose Olive Oil.

4564 2018-12-04 17:24:37 I think it is safe to say it’s oil and water.  Besides, they tend to find dates at thanksgiving and Christmas family gatherings.
4565 2018-12-04 17:24:34 Lol it was like it wasn't real
4566 2018-12-04 17:24:32 I’m sure i’m gonna be late for my oil change fuckin with this doctors office. Smh.

4568 2018-12-04 17:24:19 Mix a teaspoon of pure coconut oil in some hot tea. It sounds nuts but I swear by it.

4571 2018-12-04 17:23:46 Love that smug drive you make driving away from the petrol station forecourt after filling your car up like you’ve just spent £50 on some oil out the ground but fxck it, can drive anywhere now 
4572 2018-12-04 17:23:43 had a dream that i was at security at the airport and forgot to put my bottle of grapeseed oil in my checked bag and had to throw it away
4573 2018-12-04 17:23:36 It’s a good indicator where an elected official stands on issues by examining where individual donors work. If you favor oil and gas, likely you’ll pull from O&G employees. If you don’t, likely they won’t contribute. Not rocket science, but political science. @davidsirota

4575 2018-12-04 17:23:30 Dude yes same here. Use the coconut oil it’s good for your lashes too I think
4576 2018-12-04 17:23:29 4 injections at once 
4577 2018-12-04 17:23:18 Nah, that’s Coconut oil you smell 
4578 2018-12-04 17:23:16 you know that many of these products never used to contain oil? So taking out oil doesn't need oil replacement. That's the point your whole campaign is missing. People aren't just boycotting palm oil because it causes deforestation.
4579 2018-12-04 17:23:15 No. Don't give him credit for being absolute and effective for anything,
even the negative.
It's oil and fossil fuels.
The planet is collateral damage to his greed, corruption and compromise.

4580 2018-12-04 17:23:11 なるほど！！残念
4581 2018-12-04 17:23:10 @amberkanwar   Rubin has learned    Even changed my mind.  AB pipeline - why needed for a declining resource ? Not good news for AB.  But facts need to be faced   Energy alternatives are much more favoured in gas area. And US much stronger on fracking oil-better lighter oil
4582 2018-12-04 17:23:08 I'll give him this.  He is the king of misdirecting.

Want to give oil companies a bonus while looking strong?  Well just give oil companies what they want while saying it's to punish something you can do absolutely nothing about.
4583 2018-12-04 17:23:06 I’ll treat it today. And tell you how to apply the oil
4584 2018-12-04 17:23:04 For long eyelashes, apply a thin coat of castor oil every night. It strengthens lashes and cools your eyes.
4585 2018-12-04 17:23:00 sesame oil is such a lifesaver in making anything delicious
4586 2018-12-04 17:22:56 We can convert the gas to hydrogen for heating or transport, oil has many other uses than just fuel.
Then of course there's carbon capture, which could be world leaders in. 
4587 2018-12-04 17:22:52 @seokjin2x i got this oil cleanser from the face shop that has rice water and its rly been good to my skin and brightening it omg... im bad at skincare but i rly like this

4592 2018-12-04 17:22:30 Ask most Russians, like Nina Kouprianova, whether they think *all* Ukraine is anything other than Russian-owned. Putin annexed a maritime zone for oil and gas reserves, the NATO interference was just a serviceable excuse.

Almost every socialist country does the exact opposite, that is subside oil to the point of being dirt cheap.

4598 2018-12-04 17:22:04 Apply a 100% discount to what he said, it's not true. You couldn't have achieved >6.5% growth in the overall economy due to the oil sector (which was less than 30% of GDP between 1999 and 2007).
4599 2018-12-04 17:21:59 Consolidated financial markets

4601 2018-12-04 17:21:54 Chop it jorh, its over rated
4602 2018-12-04 17:21:44 My prediction: 

We will be actively using oil in 100 years. 

It will take 20 years for a full electric car conversion (If not longer.) 

Self-driving vehicles will be regulated to a point where only  corps or bigger business will afford to own one, grasping market control.
4603 2018-12-04 17:21:40 Agree! Yesterday David Muir (ABC News) falsely said the riots were due to increased fuel prices. Wrong! Oil prices are dropping. The riots are due to France increasing taxes on fuel.
4604 2018-12-04 17:21:38 No. But I would expect someone from Texas to have oil and natural gas money in their campaign coffers regardless of party. Just because you represent someone in a district doesn't mean you agree with them.
4605 2018-12-04 17:21:33 Stop with the lies.

Under Obama's presidency was in fact the largest domestic oil production increase during any presidency in U.S. history. From 5 million bod to 9.4 million bpd.  Natural gas production even greater.

Get the facts
4606 2018-12-04 17:21:24 But who is refining our heavy crude? We can’t just send our western oil east... they can’t refine it. It’s cheaper and easier to get it from Saudi Arabia... that’s why it’s being imported. We are in a Catch-22.
4607 2018-12-04 17:21:21 -PRECAUTION
5- Make sure to apply the tea tree oil on a clean face. And don't forget to apply moisturiser after 10-15 minutes of application (tea tree oil extremely dries out the skin)
4608 2018-12-04 17:21:20 aftermath from the 2010 oil incident
4609 2018-12-04 17:21:18 For a left political economy of the prairies, I can't recommend Prairie Capitalism by Pratt & Richards enough. And the Entrepreneurial State by Mariana Mazzucato is a good look at public investment & was the basis of our critique of the oil sands.
4610 2018-12-04 17:21:16 People talking about golden age of political civility during POTUS GHW Bush term. REALLY? I remember numerous PERSONAL not political attacks by Dems regarding POTUS. Whimp. So Dumb he didn't know about grocery store scanners. Just wanted oil from Kuwait to enrich businesses. DUH!
4611 2018-12-04 17:21:15 You know that's not what's meant when he is addressing the oil indistry
4612 2018-12-04 17:21:12 I have researched this and find the original Sirota tweet to be misleading. It was individual donors in oil industry, not corporate contributions. Is it a little bit suspicious? Yeah.
4613 2018-12-04 17:21:12 Interesting your interpretation wasn't made more clear in the first half of the article -- 'The group is backed by many donors, but by far the largest is an oil and gas magnate.'
4614 2018-12-04 17:21:08 But u can apply coconut oil on ur front hair every day

4619 2018-12-04 17:20:55 Friend of mine had his oil changed there and they didn’t put the drain plug back in. I’ve seen them leave the oil fill cap off too, it’s amazing how they mess some things up
4620 2018-12-04 17:20:49 As if a pot of hot oil is gonna come down on a child in my care and I’m gonna go “wait while I prepare my husks and aloe and use the techniques I learned in my training” bitch I’m calling 911 period
4621 2018-12-04 17:20:45 There are different types of poles (brass, chrome, stainless steel, etc), so you have to find a varnish that works best for you. Lotion/oil on your skin will make you slippery, so you want to avoid that, & for added grip you can also use a gripping solution like “Dry Hands”!
4622 2018-12-04 17:20:33 But if sharing of d VN is involved there'll be issues
4623 2018-12-04 17:20:30 A dream is a film inside of your head every night when you lie in your bed. You can have a dream that your riding a horse or you can have a see a that your drowning in oil...
Sorry it's been stuck in my head for ages
4624 2018-12-04 17:20:28 @jengerson My mom's family came to Peace River as missionaries in 1882, My dad's to Cypress Hills in 1892. We have watched oil corps under successive con govts rob the province blind. No way BC or the environment should have to pay for that
4625 2018-12-04 17:20:15 Except on OIL and COAL which is depleting our natural resources, ruining our water supplies and apparently Saudi Arabia is allowed to murder people brutally all while you defund the research into clean solutions and renewable resource technologies. Trump is paid by big oil.
4626 2018-12-04 17:20:15 It’s just beans with a lot of oil and sugar 
4627 2018-12-04 17:20:13 hehe well this will be the second time Ive had it out so it will go alot quicker this time around. was first brought in for a bad clutch but after i got it in found out the tranny was junk due to lack of gear oil.
4628 2018-12-04 17:20:08 I think Charlie Pierce calls it the 15 min rule. “All members of the Paul family can make sense for 15 minutes at a time.” My guess is the next line in the quote is about getting back whale oil standard.
4629 2018-12-04 17:20:08 Have an orgasm sis. Also I sit in the shower with hot water sprinkling on my belly, or a piping hot back. Get some cbd oil and massage it onto yourself(it’s amazing). Don’t know if you smoke but indica really helps lol ...and ginger drink.
4630 2018-12-04 17:20:04 coconut oil is lifeeee
4631 2018-12-04 17:19:59 How stupid can someone be to be importing foreign oil while we have that black gold in Alberta.  Just imagine if Saudis were importing Canadas oil.  BUILD THE PIPELINES !
4632 2018-12-04 17:19:56 Lol no gulma 
4633 2018-12-04 17:19:55 The demand is for energy. There's no future in tar sands. It's the worst form of oil for GHG, unfortunately. Technology will win out. Too bad so many ppl in Canada want to thwart green energy investments in favour of doubling down on a destructive, dead-end industry.
4634 2018-12-04 17:19:54 I’m an engineer in the oil industry now tell me about what oil pads look like after they are finished and return them back to nature. Do you know that the oil industry is one of the major reasons that the prairie chicken is making such a comeback? We recreated it’s habitat.
4635 2018-12-04 17:19:52 "[T]he only party that takes climate change seriously"?!

As in Obama spending 8 yrs ramping up domestic oil production, pimping fracking worldwide, and funding "clean coal"? And the result is that, not 2 years later, we're officially 12 years from irrevocable climate disaster.
4636 2018-12-04 17:19:50 You ate my soul just like a death eater

I'm the ocean you're an oil slick now

But I'm choking on your thought pollution
4637 2018-12-04 17:19:49 Saw someone complain in a comment on an aïoli recipe that it contained “too much garlic.” 1) you numb nuts, aïoli literally means garlic - oil 2) two cloves is too much in a garlic recipe?! 
4638 2018-12-04 17:19:44 ( lip scrub 2. ) 

- Sugar 

- Honey 

- Coconut oil
4639 2018-12-04 17:19:42 It worked if a country didn't want to trade oil in us dollars...then boom the big bush hammer came down.
4640 2018-12-04 17:19:41 The third Reich was funded initially by Zionist financiers and used imperial oil diesel in the blitzkrieg.  Interesting eh?
4641 2018-12-04 17:19:37 @kenyapipeline how stupid can  Kenyans be to accept a 2.5b 'spillage'? To whose pockets has the oil spilled??? Tumechoka kundanganywa!!!
4642 2018-12-04 17:19:31 I have two pimples I want to pop and I’ve been putting the Mario Bedascu shit on and it’s not even working! neither does tea tree oil, I want to pop these bitches but I’m trying to be strong 
4643 2018-12-04 17:19:27 In 1992 during the election against Bill Clinton Bush 41was:

An adulterer 
A war monger 
Blood for oil 
So elitist he didn't know what a supermarket scanner was 
Hated Blacks 

According to the same media that are slobbering over him now.

All lies and propaganda
4644 2018-12-04 17:19:26 I don't know what's more useless on Twitter, today. Hot takes on Avenatti not running for president, or fights over whether Beto O'Rourke is the Monopoly Man, running around with loads of Big Oil cash falling out of his pockets.
4645 2018-12-04 17:19:11 ASUU on indefinite strike
National Assembly workers on three (3) days warning strike
Oil Marketers gives FG seven (7) days notice of impending strike
NLC running out of patience on the new minimum wage. (Impending Strike)
@OfficialPDPNig @OfficialAPCNg Nigerians are watching.....
4646 2018-12-04 17:19:08 Did you bought motor oil in bulk?
4647 2018-12-04 17:18:58 Oh my goodness, shirley explained this way back in this spuds for you. As long as there is moisture getting to get out of the food, oil cannot get in. Result is crispy non greasy texture.
4648 2018-12-04 17:18:57 みんながそうやって炒められて揚げられて…ねぇ、誰のおかげ?誰のおかげかな?

＼It's OIL!!!／
4649 2018-12-04 17:18:55 But what type of rage will make you kill your 15week pregnant wife and 2 young daughters and burry them in an oil tank and a shallow grave 
4650 2018-12-04 17:18:51 Sure, when @CNN puts out a story saying low oil prices are bad for the U.S. economy, it’s all about truth and not narrative.
4651 2018-12-04 17:18:47 We are all part of the oil industry, even you, even Bernard. The working class is free to work for whomever they choose if they felt that way.
4652 2018-12-04 17:18:37 El valor mas humano, la solidaridad. No una solidaridad como estrategia de ideologia y explotación por mantener conceptos y políticas de izquierda. Las religiones son expertas en ello, por cierto también establecidas en comunidades remotas.
4653 2018-12-04 17:18:37 And while I was cleaning out my car I checked my oil and I need to get my oil changed. I don't want to spend $40 today.
4654 2018-12-04 17:18:36 “Ladies and Gentlemen, if I say I am an oil man, you will agree.”
4655 2018-12-04 17:18:34 ( lip scrub 1. ) 

- 1 Lemon 

- 1 tsp of honey 

- 1 tsp of sugar 

- 1 tsp of olive oil
4656 2018-12-04 17:18:26 My dog does this  she has really dry skin and the vet said she chews because it itches, we give her fish oil tablets (one in her food each time she eats) and medicine that our vet gave us
4657 2018-12-04 17:18:26 Oops! Who will be next? Shale Oil from Texas & New Mexico will start a price war in Summer of 2019

4660 2018-12-04 17:18:17 I'm glad we're all collectively off the coconut oil wave that shit was trash
4661 2018-12-04 17:18:14 今週土曜日なのですが、途中からでも途中まででも全然結構ですので、よろしくお願いします。詳しくは固定ツイートなどをみていただければと！
4662 2018-12-04 17:18:11 So beto was finance,real estate, insurance guy than got into oil.ok.
4663 2018-12-04 17:18:07 Butch is snake oil salesman
4664 2018-12-04 17:18:07 It's just like selling snake oil.
4665 2018-12-04 17:18:03 In parts of Texas, everyone from secretaries, to maintenance people, to janitors, to drivers work for the oil and gas industry. Probably more positions than I can think of are connected to oil & gas. Beto did not take $1 that was not from an individual. Bernie is such an snake.
4666 2018-12-04 17:18:02 Loool is the palm oil not bleached when making Ayamase ? idn if it’s just sunm my mum says
4667 2018-12-04 17:18:02 If we (UK and hence also Scotland) managed demand downwards at the rate required by climate science then wouldn't be any need for new oil & gas fields or extensions to existing fields.
4668 2018-12-04 17:17:58 *goes to get oil change*

Damn who makin pancakes??
4669 2018-12-04 17:17:47 Oil they ur head
4670 2018-12-04 17:17:47 @Ianmac611 yes and very happy to use all their oil - ta and all that
4671 2018-12-04 17:17:45 By the time she graduates high school, my daughter will know how to change oil, cook, use most shop tools, unclog a toilet, change tires and change HVAC filters. I am teaching her everything I can. My son will have the same skill set. Too many helpless young people.
4672 2018-12-04 17:17:44 Needs get an oil change today too like I’m just so overwhelmed rn
4673 2018-12-04 17:17:42 But electric cars DO need infrastructure. Helping to provide charging stations etc is necessary otherwise they would just die and big oil would just win again.
4674 2018-12-04 17:17:35 Notice that she doesn't address the subject matter, that Beto is in the pocket of Big Oil?
4675 2018-12-04 17:17:31 That's $245K out of $52Mil in total contributions. That doesn't seem like a lot to me. Maybe it shows that employees of oil companies are as fed up as the rest of us with current political climate?
4676 2018-12-04 17:17:29 Let’s hope oil country jumps on the train #pinkwhitney making Xmas with the relatives that much more doable 
4677 2018-12-04 17:17:25 I agree phoophi jaan but Pakistan zindabad slogans in congress rallies are not mere slogans they are emotions of traitors, and the sad reality is some self proclaimed liberals will burn midnight oil to prove it a Hindu Muslim issue.
4678 2018-12-04 17:17:16 lol.... I don't think it's just liberals that are unaware about most of the oil industry.

It is true that fossil fuels are used to power electric cars, but the emissions are a lot less when compared.

It's a step in the right direction.... nothing is going to change overnight.
4679 2018-12-04 17:17:15 You do realize in Texas oil is the biggest part of their GDP or....?
4680 2018-12-04 17:17:10 You must also explain campaign finance laws which require occupation on donor submission.  Just because you work in oil and gas industry does not make you shill for industry.  I worked in insurance - does not make me part of insurance lobby.
4681 2018-12-04 17:17:08 Straight climate science denying drivel. The oil industry has zero integrity and 100% greed.
4682 2018-12-04 17:17:05 You can get cbd oil with thc if you feel like getting pringled. Winning
4683 2018-12-04 17:17:03 Sorry David but Beto is owned by several billionaires not just the oil and gas billionaires, checkmate
4684 2018-12-04 17:17:01 Comman tell me what happened
4685 2018-12-04 17:16:54 #Futures ... 5.15pm & the #ftse futures dropping beyond the cash market lows .... I may put a camp bed next to my screens as these kind of moves are regularly coming after hours.. quite seriously relationships & trading are like oil & water even the dog wants to leave me 
4686 2018-12-04 17:16:53 -PRECAUTIONS- 
1- Don't use it without a doctor's prescription incase you're undergoing any skin treatment.
2- Never apply it directly to your skin, always dilute it with a carrier oil/rose water.
3- Avoid using around eye area.
4- Always do a patch test before using.
4687 2018-12-04 17:16:52 True. 
Nag pull out ang mga vessels natin sa Scarborough subalit hindi tumupad sa usapan ang China. Nanatili sila doon.

Hindi dapat makipag joint oil exploration ang Pilipinas kasi napatunayan na natin na di sila tumutupad sa usapan.
4688 2018-12-04 17:16:48 The USA has two of the best companies in the fast growing plug-in car market: Tesla & GM.

But he prefers rewarding his oil pals Putin and Mohammed bone Sawman.
4689 2018-12-04 17:16:47 I can put body oil on myself like Michael B Jordan 
4690 2018-12-04 17:16:42 Riiiight, I’m curious if you knew that oil and gas companies hire climate scientists?
4691 2018-12-04 17:16:32 What do you plan on doing for the healthcare industry, hospitals rely heavily on petrochemicals which comes from bitament which is a type of oil? Is everything in a hospital supposed to become disposable? So what your really saying is HELLO PLASTIC!!
4692 2018-12-04 17:16:31 OPEC HAS PROBLEMS, AND REASONS FOR QATAR'S EXIT MUST BE EXAMINED - IRAN OIL MINISTER: RTRS. #OOTT
4693 2018-12-04 17:16:30 Contains orange essential oil and epsom salts.  Add to bath or foot soak. Supports immune system. Ribbons may vary.

4696 2018-12-04 17:16:22 why cars don’t have a dryer thing where I can just pull the oil can shit out like a lint filter
4697 2018-12-04 17:16:12 don’t know if the cause of my breakout is my new hair vitamins or my new face oil or my period OR my zero sleep.
4698 2018-12-04 17:16:12 Dear vehicular engineers ... please stop being stupid smart people. There is a few things that require regular maintenance that you should not need a PHD in engineering to access or do. Oil filters, air filters, headlight & tail light bulbs should be EASILY accessible. Just stop
4699 2018-12-04 17:16:07 Oil is a natural resource therefore the country should take its sovereign right of controlling it.
As for what is going on in France it is a result of the taxes imposed by the French government
4700 2018-12-04 17:16:04 I mixed  Shea butter with coconut oil, olive oil and hair Wonder's hair oil
4701 2018-12-04 17:16:01 I saw that! Thanks for sharing! Hope it brings up the oil price for you guys! Insane how WCS was so low!
4702 2018-12-04 17:15:56 What essential oil will make me not look like a crackhead???
4703 2018-12-04 17:15:53 frying in coconut oil just sounds needlessly expensive to me, but it also sounds delicious
4704 2018-12-04 17:15:48 BS litmus tests like this distract from the real issues. The assumption that this entire attack is to assume Beto is with the oil lobby. He's not. I don't even like Beto that much but I don't like BS attacks like this even more. And you'd have to ask him what sways his vote.
4705 2018-12-04 17:15:40 I now take extendawise from Infowars store.
 Surprised it was a 2 mo supply so don't let the now discounted price scare you,because you get 2months worth.  Gigantic red gelcaps & contain co enzime q 10,
Garlic and fish oil.
+I support free speech&fight unconstitutional censorship
4706 2018-12-04 17:15:38 COSMOPOLITAN: Put your massage oil on their dick
4707 2018-12-04 17:15:36 Yeah, no that's not it at all.

Basically, Sirota has gone far beyond "reporting the facts" (and even there he's being misleading). Smearing Beto is more important to him than A) exposing politicians beholden to the oil&gas industry or B) addressing climate change.

Basically.
4708 2018-12-04 17:15:34 I wonder how many people,Woman's,Children's&Men's who been killed by #IDF israel government forces before media broadcast Gaza/Palestinians resistance,Yemen suffer the same,This war's are oil driven war,@codepink it's not war/defence but murder defenceless people,apartheid regime
4709 2018-12-04 17:15:28 Dems: Clean energy can
- Create jobs
- Allow us to cut off ties with Saudi Arabia and similar morally questionable oil countries 
- Help the economy
- Make America a world leader in clean energy

Reps: I think we should invest in dying businesses because
- Screw the libs

4711 2018-12-04 17:15:20 Italians will actually drink olive oil out of shot glasses, they are beyond parody.
4712 2018-12-04 17:15:19 YOU, @JustinTrudeau @kenthehr and the gov have done zero.  Increased taxes, killed Energy East and Gateway, not been a vocal supporter of oilsands. Not putting foreign oil imports thru same hurdles.  Trying to push gender politics with BILLC69. #KillBillC69 #TrudeauMustGo
4713 2018-12-04 17:15:02 the fuck? I was expecting a new bottle of face oil to arrive tomorrow!
4714 2018-12-04 17:15:02 I’ve tried from 2 different LP’s ...4 different products...all awful. I’ll stick with getting only my oil from the LP
4715 2018-12-04 17:14:58 By mentioning #chips in my previous tweet I meant salt chips or sea salt chips,I choose the chips that have the lowest ingredients such as:

•Salt
•Vegetable Oil
•Potatoes

Natural ingredients, I really watch what I fuel my body with as we only have one body to take care of
4716 2018-12-04 17:14:55 Just like PACs and I wonder what they wanted besides favorable oil deals and pressure on Yemen.
4717 2018-12-04 17:14:55 Government by the people? Republicans change the rules when the voters dare to elect Democrats, Health care is eating us alive and “a few” senators hear the truth our murderous “allies” are really up to. We don’t need their oil anymore, so why kiss up? Maybe next month!
4718 2018-12-04 17:14:54 In which case we in Scotland should demand all revenue, tax and oil, should be kept here. In addition we should not have to contribute to HS2  etc. As we voted 62% to remain, we deserve that our vote is respected.
4719 2018-12-04 17:14:52 Calgary is definitely in a worse spot that Edmonton. Largely based on having a white collar workforce, which end up being more expendable when it comes to cuts in oil companies, and they don't have the same number of government jobs as Edmonton. It definitely makes it worse.
4720 2018-12-04 17:14:51 Why even make appts?!?! Had an appt at 10:30 to get oil changed still haven’t pulled my Jeep around, fuckin ridiculous!! @KenTowerys
4721 2018-12-04 17:14:46 Why? To appease the oil companies and his Saudi buddy
4722 2018-12-04 17:14:44 The climate outside is frightful
Fires, floods and droughts are spiteful
But as long as we burn oil and coal
We've got no goal, got no goal, no climate goal

When the seas finally rise
Doubters will still doubt their eyes
They'll say it does no harm
To make the planet so warrrm
4723 2018-12-04 17:14:43 No one bid during the auction for the September sale. This is a speculative game the oil industry is playing at taxpayer expense.
4724 2018-12-04 17:14:35 Contributions are from individual people who work in different fields. 
My contributions are listed under Education profession. 

Those listed here fall under the Oil/Gas profession. These are from individuals who work in the Oil/Gas profession....in Texas, that's a lot of people
4725 2018-12-04 17:14:34 Chris Watts should be laying in an oil drum!!!
4726 2018-12-04 17:14:08 My dad worked at Willard Oil for years... he'd come home once a month and say that someone had gotten stuck under that thing.
4727 2018-12-04 17:13:54 Putting soap on meat is disgusting. The 300°F oil you drop it in kills far more bacteria than that dish detergent ever will.
4728 2018-12-04 17:13:43 Always live your life to your own standards. Don’t want to do college? That’s cool. Don’t want to have a job in the oil field? That’s more than okay. It becomes not okay when you tell somebody how a life is supposed to be lived. Nobody should listen to do those type of people. :P
4729 2018-12-04 17:13:39 I have been doing fasted rides for a while now. I do not eat after 7 pm, get up, have coffee w MCT oil and ride for up to 2.5 hours with no food. FTP has gone up and so has endurance.
4730 2018-12-04 17:13:37 You won’t give me $200 and pay for my oil change...
4731 2018-12-04 17:13:28 psst, put cheese, tomatoes, olive oil and oregano on a fish, put it to the oven and have the best meal you ever had
4732 2018-12-04 17:13:28 This whole thing seems very blown out of proportions. There’s tons of working class people in Texas who are in the oil and gas industry. Are we now supposed to make pariahs of working class people taking the best jobs available in their hometown?
4733 2018-12-04 17:13:27 The government owns the land the oil is under, and leases it to the companies. Part of that lease agreement gives the government the right to cap production on their land.

4736 2018-12-04 17:13:10 I used some gear oil in the chassis this year and regretted it because it stank for weeks :o)
Outside is waxoil. Sometimes with a bit of oil in it to make it penetrate the seams.
2.8 granny sounded mint :D
4737 2018-12-04 17:13:07 Hey Lesley! I diffused the oil the other night! 
4738 2018-12-04 17:13:06 lf you tell your mother you don't want to use the normal cooking oil because you are on a diet but she buys it anyway using your money will you not use it, what will you do........throw it away?
mnangaga used tax money, our money so the demand is well placed!
4739 2018-12-04 17:13:04 110 for a oil change ?

4743 2018-12-04 17:12:53 Ha! Ok! Read between those lines!
You know when they say, you never know who your going to work for. I used to work from a Oil Well Logging company that got acquired by Halliburton. Before Dick Cheney became VP he was my boss.
4744 2018-12-04 17:12:53 Well today has been a headache!  I am editing more videos and that is going good.  I am also taking another stab at an unscented lotion and while I was trying to open my grapeseed oil I managed to get it all over me and my kitchen.  I need a nap!
4745 2018-12-04 17:12:32 Our shops do not use Recycled oil while servicing vehicles.  Have a wonderful Day.

4758 2018-12-04 17:10:57 It’s not radical to believe people deserve a dignified life where they can get sick without choosing between their health of their home.

It’s not radical to believe we MUST fight for a #GreenNewDeal to save our planet.

It’s not radical to want to stop senseless oil wars.

4765 2018-12-04 17:10:22 Your defense of big oil buying candidates is misleading. The best candidates thrive by raising small donations from people. Ability and willingness to raise huge sums from malignant special interests that imperil all human life is a warning sign. #VetoBeto

4790 2018-12-04 17:08:42 A question from ~RG Rita:

I have chronic hip pain and anxiety. I’m only in my 4Os but my body is starting to feel like I’m much older.
I’ve gone some research on CBD oil and I’m hearing good things about it for both pain and anxiety?
Has anyone tried it? Hesitant to try.
4791 2018-12-04 17:08:39 Why is their ‘machinery’ that much better is the question!?Same companies were doing the ‘work’! It was the govt that came in & decided they could do it better,got rid of all those companies & 20yrs later here we are!Oil prices were $100+/barrel 10 yrs ago! Vzla already declining
4792 2018-12-04 17:08:37 Kicked out of a collection development meeting for insisting that we should use CBD oil on broken books instead of mending them.
4793 2018-12-04 17:08:33 He raised more money from EMPLOYEES of oil/gas companies.
It happens that he ranks number one in campaign cash from practically EVERY industry employer category.
Why? Because he raised $70 million.
More than any Senate hopeful in history, without taking any PAC or corporate cash.

4798 2018-12-04 17:07:43 I suppose the counter argument could be that the new Clair Ridge development just closes the gap between UK's daily oil production and consumption (~1.5m barrels of oil a day)? However, I don't see anyone in gov telling us how those will both be managed swiftly downwards...

4804 2018-12-04 17:07:09 Scion of the future or not (personally I think O'Rourke is overhyped), Beto took no money from corporations or PACs in his Senate campaign. That money is from individual donors whose jobs are in the oil industry, which is one of the largest in Texas, so not that surprising.

4812 2018-12-04 17:06:20 It will be long but:

Systemic crisis had its turning point in the 70s with the oil crisis, the neoliberal capitalist need for continued growth and collided with the reality of finite resources.
4813 2018-12-04 17:06:15 I agree. And this isn't about the "facts" or context. The facts are what they are re: individual oil & gas contributions. It's about how relevant these facts are, which is an opinion upon which we may validly disagree without piling on and growing to resent each other.
4814 2018-12-04 17:06:14 4 oil change in less then 1

4818 2018-12-04 17:06:00 Did he max out to Cruz as well? A lot of these people will give to both candidates to try to ensure they get a seat at the table no matter who wins. 

With Beto doing so well, I’m not surprised a number of oil guys would give money to him on the off chance he won.
4819 2018-12-04 17:05:57 methodology: "based on contributions from PACs and individuals giving $200 or more" so presumably if you gave $200 and list your employer as exxon your contribution counted as "oil and gas"
4820 2018-12-04 17:05:56 I hate having to sit here and get an oil change or figure out what’s wrong with the car like this is a mans job
4821 2018-12-04 17:05:40 He can slow our Oil to the coast if he keeps BC left-wing... So he’s spending time patronizing them. 

We either go south to the US, or Northeast to Churchill. All expensive compared to BC...

Plus, Sophie doesn’t want him around, so there that... :-)
4822 2018-12-04 17:05:40 Sure. All I took issue with was your obviously deliberate misrepresentation of the actual fact.  Better said, something like Beto received donations from almost 1800 individuals who work in Texas' primary industry, the oil and gas...
     Stay honest, ffs!
4823 2018-12-04 17:05:38 Sorry no, don't know what it is other than oil.
4824 2018-12-04 17:05:37 I think we should be looking at where Democrats get their money but also there's a difference in Beto taking oil/gas PAC money (he didn't) and him accepting small dollar donations from people who work in that industry in freaking Texas.

4830 2018-12-04 17:04:52 The Arabic word for olive, “zaytun” (زيتون), is the source of the word for olive in Spanish (aceituna), and is also related to the word for edible oil in both languages.

4832 2018-12-04 17:04:35 The original argument stands. All of the people on that list are in GOP leadership or represent districts/states that have a large oil/natural gas industry. It's easy as someone from CA or Toronto in your case to hit reps for this but it's called representing your district.
4833 2018-12-04 17:04:30 I don't know how that isn't an explanation. People, particularly the donors donating over $1,000, are not donating to candidates that would want to destroy their industry, as any good progressive should want to do to the oil & gas industry. Pretty simple why its relevant.
4834 2018-12-04 17:04:30 Where did you get that figure from? It is not correct. 3000-5000 a year due to deforestation for many uses including palm oil, as well as direct hunting, trafficking and mining. @emeijaard
4835 2018-12-04 17:04:25 If they want lower oil/gas prices all they have to do is sacrifice a journalist to the oil gods. That's what trump did.

4837 2018-12-04 17:04:17 Fine with Texas.  Major new oil reserves have been found, especially in the Permian Basin; the wells are expected to go online in 2019.  Since we can now make a profit of $40 per barrel ( unlikeOPEC), the economies of the Gulf states are about to take a major hit.
4838 2018-12-04 17:04:15 American oil industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller said, “Don’t be afraid to give up the good to go for the great.”

4842 2018-12-04 17:03:54 This is still disingenuous. Ok, that’s one donation. Unless the oil and gas companies have over 1,000 execs who all maxed out their donations, your theory is flawed. Furthermore, you are inferring that an oil exec can’t lean progressive. That’s also disingenuous.

That way, you’re negatively incentivizing companies to stop using oil while positively incentivizing companies to use alternative (and greener) sources of energy.
4861 2018-12-04 17:02:35 Experts in the science field have reaffirmed countless times about climate change and the negative effects oil and coal have on the environment.

4872 2018-12-04 17:01:33 I say let’s convince TransCanada to build #energyeast & get our products down to Atlantic Canada and the Irving refinery in NB. And stop importing conflict oil from places like Saudi Arabia & Nigeria.
4873 2018-12-04 17:01:31 it's not a bad thing. The jobs on the oil wells are very tough
4874 2018-12-04 17:01:27 My perspective is that if an individual is shown to taken $50,000 from a fossil fuel pac, that deserves the same level of scrutiny as if it came from maxed individual donations of oil executives. Ultimately, what matters is whether that money will buy influence for the industry.
4875 2018-12-04 17:01:19 It's yer union that is the cause of all the financial woes in the UK. And you are complicate. Where is the oil fund. The BBC licence fee scandal. The millions spent on wars, killing and maiming for  fun. Labour? I fart in your general direction
4876 2018-12-04 17:01:04 Max has said what no politician is saying about Quebec.
They do not like equalization payments
They want to refine Canadian oil and Abolish Saudi  oil
The west gets it out of ground and Quebec and the east can refine it. 
Big disconnect between politicians and voters in Quebec
4877 2018-12-04 17:00:59 First we will pollute.
Next, we will clean up.
To the shock of many -- & to the delight of all concerned about global warming -- Shell Oil announced it is linking the pay of its #CEO to the company's meeting aggressive #climate #change reduction targets.

4878 2018-12-04 17:00:57 Why are you Berners so easily duped about so many things? Have you even looked at his top contributors? GOOGLE.  Amazon.  And dozens of massive corporations.  Beto is FROM Texas. Why WOULDN'T he get oil/gas money?  Why does Bernie protect the F-35?  LEARN.  Do better.
4879 2018-12-04 17:00:53 Easy - @OliveologyUK products, so dad can feel like a master chef, cooking with organic foodie products – then slather his body with olive oil and walnut soap.

Did I take it too far?
4880 2018-12-04 17:00:45 Methane is 25 time more greenhousy than CO2. All living things die and turn into methane, CH4 and coal. The stupid crusade against the oil companies has neutered the Democratic party. Cut it out. Global warming is a scientific certainty until the next ice age.
4881 2018-12-04 17:00:44 Framed as a rate increase not a tax increase with the headline.
4882 2018-12-04 17:00:42 Fact is @Ocasio2018 cares deeply about environment moreso than most currently in a position to do something about it. Her initiative will have monumental significance if successfully passed so your judgment is completely misguided. Coal and oil should not be growing
4883 2018-12-04 17:00:40 I put coconut oil in my coffee and now my lips are oily
4884 2018-12-04 17:00:37 I like the sustainably-fished packed in oil kind, but it’s expensive! Plus, I just eat fresh fish, which is less convenient than canned tuna, I guess, but more delicious.

And yes I own a can opener.
4885 2018-12-04 17:00:37 I’ve never tried oil paints in fur.
4886 2018-12-04 17:00:37 My girlfriend is 10,000 miles overdue for an oil change, brakes squeaking and switching lanes like Richard Petty snorted Tom Petty but I’ll be damned if there’s a water bottle in my passenger seat!
4887 2018-12-04 17:00:34 According to the records, Beto took 83% of his blood money from big oil. Only 17% came from small donors.
4888 2018-12-04 17:00:32 I hate getting oil changes done or car stuff done. The waiting room is so boring
4889 2018-12-04 17:00:31 if i remember correctly coconut oil is used for cooking in lots of west africa?  i can't imagine it's just never been done, since most folks over there use both ingredients, but i've also never seen anything written comparing diff oils for plantaining
4890 2018-12-04 17:00:30 Nope and I will be returning my items to the store I purchased at in Canada and will be actively boycotting @GapCA until they recant banning Canadian oil.

4892 2018-12-04 17:00:29 Did you know that the American oil industry currently receives over 4 billion a year in subsidies? It's obvious that this country is going backwards not making an effort to seek out new, reusable energy sources.
4893 2018-12-04 17:00:26 this dealership needs to hurry with my oil change cause a nigga hungry 
4894 2018-12-04 17:00:21 おーまだ起きてたのかー作業か？無理するなよ？
4895 2018-12-04 17:00:20 Best meal plan -if anyone doesn't know where to start: Big bowl of Green Salads with 1 piece of grass fed meat and some coconut oil or ghee.
4896 2018-12-04 17:00:14 12/04: Organic broccolini, onion, mozzarella & cheddar cheese; garnished with garlic olive oil, organic lemon zest & parsley
4897 2018-12-04 17:00:08 He is truly a humanitarian hero and financial genius wisely distributing Canada's excess oil revenues. NOT
4898 2018-12-04 17:00:01 This may have something to do with the lack of fossil fuels in France. Unlike the US most of Europe is barren when it comes to oil production and have to rely on Middle East or Russia, but hey what do I know? I just live in Europe.
4899 2018-12-04 16:59:57 They are actually not looking into the future.Nigeria will always be the five foolish virgins arriving late at the banquet with their oil finished.
4900 2018-12-04 16:59:57 "Produce less oil permanently" is not possible given the fact oil demand is increasing. If it's not produced in Alberta it's produced elsewhere. You may want to revisit your understanding of economics & logic before trying to take the pretentious high horse and failing miserably.
4901 2018-12-04 16:59:34 South Sudan's cities and especially slums are populated by "environmental refugees" fleeing loss of home, livestock and water caused by alarming levels of water pollution - due to oil contamination - new scientific study from #UN institute of environment and university in #China
4902 2018-12-04 16:59:33 Republican logic: If we haven't started using oil, we wouldn't have all of this technologies; therefore we should not consider any other alternatives and ignore the impacts the fossil fuel has on the environment!
4903 2018-12-04 16:59:22 I just lunched on a slew of French Green Beans with a drizzle of Walnut oil and fresh Tarragon.
4904 2018-12-04 16:59:18 (2) into the atmosphere. As of now, if the government acknowledged climate change instead of being in the pockets of oil companies, massive changes would happen. Look at the EU for example, which has been working to push forward carbon taxes and regulations in order to stop the..
4905 2018-12-04 16:59:15  we will be in lagos soon 
4906 2018-12-04 16:59:07 I text you because someone was texting me as he was pastor Alph Lukau but he wasn’t and after word he was telling me to send him 400€ for anointing oil and salt and as he told me that I knew he was not pastor Alph Lukau
4907 2018-12-04 16:59:06 Trump is dismantling environmental protections as well as opening up new areas for oil & gas exploration in national parks, off the coasts, etc. He is part of the problem which needs 2 be addressed too. Also, arent all townhalls political stunts to showcase a topic is of interest
4908 2018-12-04 16:59:05 Again, there's nothing wrong with the fact that the oil industry is terrible for our environment? Nothing wrong with corporations screwing over working class?
4909 2018-12-04 16:59:04 The environmentalists also argued that new oil activities in the fragile Arctic region would be contrary to the 2016 Paris climate accord, which seeks to limit average global warming to under two degrees Celsius.
4910 2018-12-04 16:59:03 I guess $50 M is peanuts to Trudeau considering Alberta is losing more than that in daily revenue due to our discounted oil.
4911 2018-12-04 16:59:01 Working out while I’m in keto diet i use pre-workout MCT oil one teaspoon ,,, impressive results my lifting weights numbers return similar when i used to be on high carbs diet
4912 2018-12-04 16:58:59 the big oil companies cause 71% of all greenhouse gasses but sure it is our fault.
4913 2018-12-04 16:58:56 I should buy some gojo for whenever I do my oil change
4914 2018-12-04 16:58:49 We'd be expecting. Don't forget to wash off the oil also.
4915 2018-12-04 16:58:46 ไม่อยากให้เพื่อนงานค้าง เเละตัวเค้าเองด้วย
4916 2018-12-04 16:58:42 Hi!! It was the Spicy Argan oil....it's a natural aphrodisiac don't you know?!
4917 2018-12-04 16:58:42 You eat this from the palm oil. 
4918 2018-12-04 16:58:39 They paid 4 billion for it. Yes, sorry. 

They aren't phasing out oil or natural gas. That would take decades and we would need an alternative that isn't ready for 2 - 4 decades.

The courts froze the pipeline. The build lacked proper consultation under CND law via Harper's govt.
4919 2018-12-04 16:58:39 It’s a broad brush - but generally, I think it’s fair to assume that in most cases (you may be an exclusion) people will vote for politicians to support their industry. Oil and gas is especially bad considering climate change and whatnot
4920 2018-12-04 16:58:37 The groups Greenpeace, Natur og Ungdom (Nature and Youth) and the Grandparents Climate Campaign had accused Norway, western Europe’s largest oil and gas producer, of violating a new article of country’s constitution that guarantees since 2014 the right to a healthy environment.
4921 2018-12-04 16:58:26 I’m sorry but there’s nothing like a fresh oil change, a full tank, and a clean car 
4922 2018-12-04 16:58:24 Actually price of crude oil has drastically dropped in the last two months. So yeah that's why they are reducing fuel prices
4923 2018-12-04 16:58:18 I don't want to know a damn thing about oil and gas! I want to end the "cycle" altogether.
4924 2018-12-04 16:58:13 "Do you remember what a logic given by Norwegian Court while dismissing Environmental Case?" 5th January, 2018, OSLO: A Norwegian court on Thursday dismissed a case by three environmentalist groups which had sued Norway for granting oil licences in the Arctic.
4925 2018-12-04 16:58:12 I agree that a tax on fossil fuels is no more effective than regulation. What would be effective is an existential threat to oil companies. The beauty is, oil employees would thank you for the opportunity to stop serving out of control heartless corporations.
4926 2018-12-04 16:58:11 Spending my day off getting tags, an oil change, & making phone calls for bills. Adulting sucks.
4927 2018-12-04 16:58:10 Thank you for supporting him. Will you both be in support of the green new deal. An effort to get oil/petroleum based economy to be eradicated over little time, to preserve the health of the planet and those upon it? Our economy is based on petroleum extraction/sales/uses.
4928 2018-12-04 16:58:07 If @UNC really cared about saving money, they’d quit wasting it on climate change snake oil.
4929 2018-12-04 16:58:06 It’s delicious. The ghee and cream give it a rich buttery taste. The coconut oil gives a hint of coconut and the cocoa butter gives a hint of chocolate.  And coffee is well... coffee.
4930 2018-12-04 16:57:57 งั้นเค้าเปิดคอมละ เนยทำดิ
4931 2018-12-04 16:57:53 But he didn't just "post stats".  He posted a ham handed analysis, baselessly claiming the money came from "oil/gas execs".  I expect more from our side, especially from would-be leaders. (I thought you were cool, @davidsirota)
4932 2018-12-04 16:57:48 does tea tree oil actually work to get rid of pimples?
4933 2018-12-04 16:57:47 Lol!!
Suddenly Burna fans aren't fans anymore. 
Common 15k and people are complaining
4934 2018-12-04 16:57:42 Possible UCL ban for City next year because of FFP violations? Or will oil money prevail once again.
4935 2018-12-04 16:57:39 Hey commie french ! Luvin us some TAX CUTS , some massive DEREGULATIONS  & an ECONOMIC BOOM !! COURTESY of our great president our FREE MARKET system & good ole USA CAPITALISM!  Oh and the OIL GLUT !!! PAYIN ONLY $1.50 A GALLON HERE COMMIES !!!  A VERY MERRY CAPITALIST CHRISTMAS
4936 2018-12-04 16:57:31 buy oil
4937 2018-12-04 16:57:20 The world is full of ignorant ppl. No one is willing to give up BIG OIL. SO UNTIL THE STFU. INDUSTRIAL HEMP IS THE ONLY RESOURCE THAT CAN RIVAL BIG OIL. ALL YOU SO CALLED BRAINIACS ARE AS DUMB AS EMISSIONS IS BAD. GIVE UP PLASTIC STRAWS THAT'LL DO IT. LAUGH.
4938 2018-12-04 16:57:11 Yeah. Oil didn’t work. I’d be happy with 75%. But most is only 60%. It can manage it. But I’ve found that it just gets me to a somewhat functional level. But, nothing more.
4939 2018-12-04 16:57:04 Ameen
4940 2018-12-04 16:56:57 Discussion is fine as long as it’s in the context of all contributions received.  Retired people contributed 7 times as much as oil&gas.  And how many of those retired contributors maxed out?   Show me a list of all contributors who maxed out and their industry.
4941 2018-12-04 16:56:49 yung di ka mkatulog w/o applying efficascent oil/white flower/vaporin  matanda na tlga ako hohoho

4943 2018-12-04 16:56:29 Michelle, I have been using @PharmaHempCplx products for chronic pain & anxiety for the last 3 months. It's extremely beneficial to me. I highly recommend this product. It's the best CBD oil I have come across. I tell every1 there is junk CBD oil out there. This stuff is legit !!
4944 2018-12-04 16:56:25 Guy was just greeting a kung girl that came to pay respect and honour him, he's just bn compassionate.
4945 2018-12-04 16:56:20 Thc , cbd oil
4946 2018-12-04 16:56:15 Depends how much you want oil to turn to sludge and eventually clog up your engine lol
4947 2018-12-04 16:56:14 I'm surprised it's not number one. I know oil helps... but you can't have a proper massage without coffee!
4948 2018-12-04 16:56:07 a 20something gay got mad at me for saying cbd is the new snake oil

4950 2018-12-04 16:56:04 You know why? Because we share our currency with you... The ''Canadian average'' is driving the value of the Canadian dollar, including the oil industry with whom we have absolutly nothing to do. Its actually in our interest to have a weak dollar and cheap oil prices...
4951 2018-12-04 16:56:03 How much oil money to pay off UEFA?
4952 2018-12-04 16:56:03 That is OUTRAGEOUSLY FALSE. You’re a great Snake Oil Salesmen,but you lie about things that can be proved to be a LIE in 10 seconds.Go back to hacking cheap condos, crappy ties & useless College Degrees. You were successful at being a HUCKSTER.But a watch Salesmen on 5th is avail
4953 2018-12-04 16:56:02 Dipsticks like Trump can at least tell you when your snake oil is low.
4954 2018-12-04 16:55:59 RU an SA are flooding the Markets w oil as demand weakens to gain market share Only govt own oil companies would do such a dumb move Putty an MBS dont understand lower value of reserves lowers what the market will loan you
4955 2018-12-04 16:55:52 Hmmm plantain fried in coconut oil is something I've only seen gringeauxs do. Correct me if your culture of color does this though.
4956 2018-12-04 16:55:47 haah dia ada mineral oil. kalau rasa tak okay dengan mineral oil better avoid
4957 2018-12-04 16:55:42 If you’re using a synthetic oil from the dealer, and you go over 1000k on your oil change it’s not going to kill your car, if you maintain it regularly you should be ok.
4958 2018-12-04 16:55:36 Every racing fan should buy Lucas Oil products. The amount of money they spend on racing is unbelievable. I buy all the Lucas Oil products I can.
4959 2018-12-04 16:55:33 Oil is done.  Get into the renewables and stop subsidizing the product that kills our environment.  #KeepItInTheGround Canada needs #LocktheGate
4960 2018-12-04 16:55:17 Free market capitalism isn't an inherently bad thing.
The issue is that what we have now ISN'T free trade so long as oil companies continue to receive tax breaks, often just because they're domestically operated.
4961 2018-12-04 16:55:11 use a good heat protector (maybe one with argan oil), lower heat, and when you’re ready for your curls, try a hair mask to reset your hair.
4962 2018-12-04 16:55:05 ป่าวอ่ะ เเค่รอกดดันเพื่อนเฉยๆ
4963 2018-12-04 16:55:03 Detailed novel? It's not very hard to say, "Beto got a lot more oil and gas money, but of course he got more money from every industry and group because he raised so many small donations."

Seems to me people on both sides are going nuts over it, going on 24 hours now.
4964 2018-12-04 16:54:45 ねるじかんだよ〜〜
4965 2018-12-04 16:54:35 Watching a tutorial video, not for learning what's being shown, as I know it already (I was doing oil paintings 40 years ago)... It's for the entertainment value of the presenter, who is self-deprecating, out of their depth, and rather manic... 
4966 2018-12-04 16:54:30 I would clearly prefer Beto to not have this pock on his resume. Given he's from TX, that will be hard to sanitize his records of all oil/gas workers, methinks. I also think that (most) Bernie fans border on a cult-like reverence for the man, which is no good for the movement.
4967 2018-12-04 16:54:28 That lavender oil I bought is awesome.
4968 2018-12-04 16:54:28 Disagree, Bush was first criminal Big Oil President. Also cowtowed to MIC. Starting war in Panama. Protecting House Of Saud.
4969 2018-12-04 16:54:27 “A national day mourning” fuck him and his middle eastern friends who helped his dumb ass son’s oil company from being a disaster
4970 2018-12-04 16:54:26 Also, he's a party to the making and continuing of world's worst humanitarian catastrophe in Yemen and press revelation of theft of Yemen oil by Total makes him a daylight robber on an international scale
4971 2018-12-04 16:54:25 Thanks for the fracking tip, I must have missed that when I worked for Schlumberger on offshore oil rigs...

It’s LUCKY because methane emits half the CO2 as coal per unit energy. Energy industry ain’t trying to help the environment, they’re helping their bottom line.
4972 2018-12-04 16:54:24 @7OnYourSideNY @chevrolet has determined my father is at fault for maintenance negligence yet they have only asked for the last oil change receipt? What kind of due dillegence is this?
4973 2018-12-04 16:54:21 Iranian President Hassan Rouhani made an apparent threat on Tuesday to disrupt other countries’ oil shipments through the Gulf if Washington presses ahead with efforts to halt Iranian oil exports.
4974 2018-12-04 16:54:19 Niggas be like “CaN YoU cOoK” lookin ass... Nigga can you change my oil & tires tf

4977 2018-12-04 16:54:00 Now there’s a huge surprise. Oil companies support congressional candidates from (wait for it) Texas!
4978 2018-12-04 16:53:44 村がムラムラ
4979 2018-12-04 16:53:44 You sir, are a fool. And Trump is a bigger fool for believing the Saudi’s had nothing to do with murdering a reporter. He wants to protect $$$$$$. If we lose oil from The Saudi’s, so be it. We are USA strong and can survive without their oil.
4980 2018-12-04 16:53:34 But keeping them on coal and oil! The @realDonaldTrump administration thinks it’s the 1970’s again 
4981 2018-12-04 16:53:33 WE - ARE - NOT - SINGING - THIS (like ... not at all, Trump is just seen as a joke in France)

- Our government is right-winged
- People do riot against oil prices and taxes
- People riot also because the government prefer to tax the poors, and to suppress riches' taxes.
4982 2018-12-04 16:53:31 @Alaska @POTUS @Congress @Senate @EPA ***Alaska,  Oil Drilling & Fracking & Seismic Testing - CAUSE EARTHQUAKES!
4983 2018-12-04 16:53:30 I feel like his followers are experiencing what people in cults experience. He tells them what they want to hear. He’s a snake oil salesman. But they need to believe that what he says to be true, because the alternative is that they were swindled by a wanna be caudillo.
4984 2018-12-04 16:53:22 あのレベルをやれば政府が考えを改めるという例に捉えれるけど、逆にいうとあのレベルのデモをやらないと政府は国民の事を聞かないってことだから…日本は、どうしようもないんだろうな…あのレベルのデモを日本では無理やろ

4991 2018-12-04 16:52:38 Where can I get some good honeysuckle body oil?
4992 2018-12-04 16:52:33 Though the expectation was an agreement on the #oil production cut between #Saudi and #Russia after the meeting of #Putin & #Ben_Salman. #OOTT #OPEC #energy #oilandgas
4993 2018-12-04 16:52:24 No money from PACs or oil and gas! All of his money was from individuals . I donated 2500 to his campaign!
4994 2018-12-04 16:52:08 My favorite shampoo is Mielle organics. Fav conditioner is Trader Joe’s tea tree one. But the moisture part all about the deep conditioning. Honestly you can pre poo with coconut oil that may help but the monoi oil repairing hair mask (CD) is truth and TGIN mask is good
4995 2018-12-04 16:52:06 You can … … change your own oil?
4996 2018-12-04 16:51:43 Have to agree completely. Especially with the non gendering of the classes.  Everyone should know how to cook and how to change their own oil. Of course in my family my wife actually burned instant oatmeal and i forgot to tighten the lugs on a tire. So i cook and she fixes cars
4997 2018-12-04 16:51:40 Nothing to do with Bush and his son wanting oil then?
4998 2018-12-04 16:51:38 This is a burgeoning neo communist utopia. Fixing intended or unintended interventions in business, with more interventions in business. As a lifelong albertan in the oil and gas industry, this government embarrasses me to depths I never though possible.
4999 2018-12-04 16:51:36 Moved out of my apartment and thought I was going to save my rent money this month.... 

Pulled up at work for an oil change and they hit me with $1000 bill  wayment

5001 2018-12-04 16:51:18 Earlier today, someone passed me on a motorized bicycle. I smelled motor oil and heard motor noises, yet saw a bicycle. I’ve never been so perplexed in my life.
5002 2018-12-04 16:51:18 Yes, nope and nope. We'd probably have transitioned to a green economy by now. And why are we in the Middle East at all? Dependence on oil.
5003 2018-12-04 16:51:02 Wow a Tx politican gets donations from oil & gas industry. I'm shocked!
5004 2018-12-04 16:51:00 If you think accepting small donations from individuals who happen to work in the oil industry is corruption, we have nothing to talk about.
5005 2018-12-04 16:50:41 Is this for real? Whisky and oil not Scottish if independent. Again, even my 11 year old labradoodles knows they are.
5006 2018-12-04 16:50:36 Ohhh i know what you mean, if you rub your fingers on your hair the oil from your hair actually soaks up the stickyness on your fingers! I do it all the time
5007 2018-12-04 16:50:34 The early industrialised part of the world could have chosen not to burn coal and oil and to develop a system which is based on high energy intensivity.
5008 2018-12-04 16:50:28 People love to trot out Venezuela as an example of failed socialism, but it is a failure due to many, many reasons other than socialism. Weak democracy, rise of dictator, over-reliance on oil revenues.
5009 2018-12-04 16:50:07 Yeah I totally agree with you @eschwarzkopf! Tough to raise money in TX without anybody from the oil/gas industry.
5010 2018-12-04 16:49:56 Mailing packages for sure. Oil changes. I even hate getting gas.
5011 2018-12-04 16:49:54 ADAPALM dead? Imo can encourage the development of our oil palm plantation and some export crops. Think HOPE. Think Imo Hope 2019. I believe.
5012 2018-12-04 16:49:53 ههههه، كتبة التقارير
5013 2018-12-04 16:49:41 cannot believe people with no experience with dermatology told people to put coconut oil on their skin and people listened
5014 2018-12-04 16:49:40 @realFemiOtedola bought AP from the federal government, turned around the company and has evolved into Forte Oil one of the largest player in the oil industry and a massive employer of Labor. How does Atiku sold it to himself? Facts are sacred!
5015 2018-12-04 16:49:39 Do you seriously think that oil/gas interests in TX preferred Beto to Cruz? If so, what do you think it was about Beto's policy positions that they liked?
5016 2018-12-04 16:49:39 ....kuma ka hakura??
5017 2018-12-04 16:49:39 if the oil can last for 8 days you can last for 30 minutes
5018 2018-12-04 16:49:37 "Disney Owes" .... This one might has drank motor oil before tweeting this
5019 2018-12-04 16:49:24 Which foods, I've stocked up upon Oil & Coffee?
5020 2018-12-04 16:49:23 St George Auto Repair is having a CHRISTMAS SPECIAL to try and get donations for the local food banks! bring in 4 items of non perishable food and receive a conventional oil change(up to 5qrts), and a tire rotation for $24.99! We sincerely want to wish you all a MERRY CHRISTMAS!
5021 2018-12-04 16:49:21 STOP SELLING 
hydro2states while we as Manitobans see absolutely no benifts from it,should be getting decreases from the amount you sell south etc bloody Communism,all bow down n take it up the arse over so much blatent bullshit...let's pay others to refine our own oil too !!!!!
5022 2018-12-04 16:49:20 Most people think that the market for growers is in the flowers, but a few growers I know are no longer cleaning buds, they turn the whole plant into wax or oil. Much easier to transport, and sells for more $ w/ less waste. Buyers either do dabs or vape it.
5023 2018-12-04 16:49:20 i'm finally getting back into yugioh!

time to drown my head in a bucket of oil!
5024 2018-12-04 16:49:16 .@EconCharlie Avocado toast is too dry unless paired with a runny egg and/or some sort of spread and oil. HOT TAKE
5025 2018-12-04 16:49:16 Apparently the gov covers the profit markup so cars are bought at cost price in Dubai. 
Oil and Arab money is just beyond us. 
Makufika kitsi sekunema duties and taxes and the mark up :(
5026 2018-12-04 16:49:14 I just googled 'history oil lamps'
must be researching fic

5028 2018-12-04 16:49:13 I see in the thread people are saying it's Nigerian boli but if so call it that not "Latin inspired" fried plantains. This wasn't even in the same building as a caldero full of oil.
5029 2018-12-04 16:49:12 交通量多過ぎでアクションに目がいかないwwww
5030 2018-12-04 16:49:09 Definitely not coconut oil. That shit sits right on my scalp and doesn’t nothing. That monoi oil sounds like a plan though. Do you use any of her shampoos/conditioners?
5031 2018-12-04 16:49:05 ダイエットしていたって、時にはオイルも必要だろう?
5032 2018-12-04 16:49:01 @JessikaGuse just listening to yesterday’s #realagradio - Premier Notley probably made the announcement Sunday night re: oil cut due to markets (oil and others) opening in Asia - futures in North America start trading early in the evening on Sunday
5033 2018-12-04 16:48:59 comprei o físico de oil porra Sophie seu mijo sempre beberei
5034 2018-12-04 16:48:39 See just be going 
5035 2018-12-04 16:48:37 Yo I fuckinn loveee jojoba oil  I’m on my cycle & a bitch face never been clearer  skin smooth as hell
5036 2018-12-04 16:48:33 Best bulletproof coffee
 High quality Coffee
High quality unsalted butter
Cinnamon 
Shilajit
MCT/Brain Octane oil 
That simple for an awesome litness
5037 2018-12-04 16:48:30 Scot are not taking 92% of Scottish oil revenues for 50 years
How does THAT work and how s that FAIR?
EVEL stops cots voting on English matter but Westminster is taking scots from the EU against our 62% remain vote!
How does that work in a fair union?
5038 2018-12-04 16:48:28 Honestly, In my opinion it’s about what you put in your body...Drink LOTS OF WATER !!!! Also instead of using a make up wipe to remove your make up use coconut oil and wash your face with soap and warm water every night, I’ve seen a HUGE* difference with using coconut oil.
5039 2018-12-04 16:48:27 I’m so wary of giving my keys to anyone like I’m getting my oil changed and they need my car keys to move the car around but I’m like 
5040 2018-12-04 16:48:18 Woke up early to get my oil changed bc I’m a responsible adult (?????)
5041 2018-12-04 16:48:04 I’m a good car parent and scheduled my next maintenance appointment. (I’d change my own oil,, but I want a dealer service record in case of any warranty claims.)
5042 2018-12-04 16:47:57 It's akin to telling a patient to pay $2 million dollars and then to drink this class of oil to cure their cancer. There's no scientific value it's preying on people's hope
5043 2018-12-04 16:47:43 Abuja 
5044 2018-12-04 16:47:39 I can see how government expropriation of oil companies etc. seems rational & logical but it has failed often and becomes a corrupting influence on the mechanisms of governance. @themmagraham @Lagarde
5045 2018-12-04 16:47:36 Who is going to pay for the wall? Mexico. Well promises made, promises not delivered. At best you are a snake oil salesman, and a bad one at that.
5046 2018-12-04 16:47:28 Thank you, David for sharing this information. It’s important that people are aware that @BetoORourke received or has received donations from the gas/oil industry.
5047 2018-12-04 16:47:17 I hate getting an oil change by myself man mfs be trying to convince me to get everything.... you need a new radiator and motor, you want us to change it? Bitch 
5048 2018-12-04 16:47:16 Egg roll. Squirted hot oil and blistered my lip
5049 2018-12-04 16:47:12 Give the less desirable chocolates to the NG reporters.  Based on the presumption that NG traders don't know "boo" about crude oil and that may bleed into NG journos who might take the lesser chocolate value.  All of this stated with affection for my NG friends #OOTT #natgas
5050 2018-12-04 16:47:00 This rose oil is magicallll
5051 2018-12-04 16:46:58 mmmm cardbaord & morot oil
5052 2018-12-04 16:46:58 For Norway, it was oil wealth.

Also, social welfare programmes worked well in Britain until neoliberalism started its havoc.
5053 2018-12-04 16:46:51 What about shutting down all the gas pumps for a day to honor him & his family for all the wars they started to profit their oil ties.

5056 2018-12-04 16:46:35 There is so little misogyny you have pounce on every little thing in hopes of striking oil. I genuinely feel bad you are a victim of cultural Marxism.
5057 2018-12-04 16:46:25 Nigeria should be ashamed to spend oil money.. We did not work for it , we did not put it there..so we don't need to be happy to spend it. We don't have any value to the rest of the world... No export.. Except Churches...
5058 2018-12-04 16:46:14 I understand you start raw- but I know many people who think they can cook and just blend the flour with oil and put it in the stock without cooking it-- did I say people? I meant MORONS!
5059 2018-12-04 16:46:11 The slow roll under the radar. Inhofe leaks petroleum out of pant legs he is so saturated with dirty oil money.
5060 2018-12-04 16:46:10 It will help reduce the oil build up in your hair, however revisit them.
5061 2018-12-04 16:46:05 I had great luck with Neutrogena T-Gel (or its generic substitute), and tea tree oil shampoo as well.  Reducing my stress levels helped a lot, too.
5062 2018-12-04 16:46:02 Same sis. Same. LOC or coconut oil doesn’t do anythingggg!!! The best oil I have ever used was the monoi oil from carols daughter
5063 2018-12-04 16:46:02 Today is National Cookie Day. Get in that kitchen and do your part as a good American!  

But think outside the box and use olive oil in those cookies!   This recipe was a semi-finalist in the 2018 Edible Houston Magazine contest.
5064 2018-12-04 16:45:56 ICC is the scam of criminals that are out there to sent the few in jail. So don't even mention that as one of her achievements, Why is Bush out of jail even if he agreed to have attacked and killed Saddam for no apparent reason...We know he was looking to own Iraq's oil. STOP IT
5065 2018-12-04 16:45:52 That inflection point where Gold & Oil start to run, regardless of the market, is coming and feels like we are just around the corner. Gold will get a bid on uncertainty in markets and oil will spike regardless of the economy as geopolitics and fundamentals are the drivers.
5066 2018-12-04 16:45:52 Not entirely sure about that (my sole involvement with oil and gas was [redacted] some dumb firmware shit), but if that is true, then the problem will self-resolve amicably
5067 2018-12-04 16:45:46 turshi with olive oil drizzled on top >>>
5068 2018-12-04 16:45:42 He, also, didn’t forget he made his monies from oil overseas.  
5069 2018-12-04 16:45:29 Before citizens united, this is how the industries propped up their preferred candidates. individuals or Pacs support politicians who agree on their issues. The well payed Oil and gas workers aren't going  to contribute to kill their industries.
5070 2018-12-04 16:45:27 So Beto takes $S427,000.00 from oil companies and Sanders holds a Green Deal forum, and they're both 'progressives'. Burn your dictionaries, folks.

5078 2018-12-04 16:44:44 In talking to a climate change denier, he mentioned how other countries implement and spend carbon tax
Hate to say i agree,  there is no good model yet
So lets make the perfect model for the USA
Tariff oil imports as our carbon tax
Spend on green conversion grants for homes
5079 2018-12-04 16:44:40 I would. And eventually we all will. Fossil fuels are a finite, & eventually dwindling resource. What will happen when oil/coal/natural gas become scarce & incredibly hard to obtain? The taxes we pay now must fund the future alternatives to these finite resources.
5080 2018-12-04 16:44:39 This is because SK is sneaking its oil and LNG across the border to the Bakken.....and then transported to US ports. There are some sneaky bastages in Regina. 
5081 2018-12-04 16:44:36 にじ。。。
5082 2018-12-04 16:44:34 ...What? What does the dropping cost of green energy have to do with privatized oil industries continuing to operate in a way that's destroying the planet? Those industries have to be ended and yes, green infrastructure must be built but it cannot be left up to the private sector
5083 2018-12-04 16:44:32 How is it that the Clinton's & Bush's became so close? I've beleaved for year's that the oil industry has more power with our government than any politician has, maybe John Kennedy resisting them had something to do with his death, they have us all dependent on oil product's.
5084 2018-12-04 16:44:30 That’s not what anyone is saying. You can donate to whomsoever you wish, but even if you work in the oil and gas industry, your donation is just your individual donation. He’s taking donations from people not oil and gas companies.
5085 2018-12-04 16:44:21 my mom thought my fish oil was just omega 3 oil and tried to drink it  lmao never seen someone puke so fast

5088 2018-12-04 16:44:04 @AndrewWheeler23 is A “FRAUD” ! He is in Also in Pockets Of Oil Company’s To Boost His OWN INCOME ! He’s Not CREDIBLE In ANYTHING He DOES or SAYS ! A Genuine “FRAUD”
5089 2018-12-04 16:44:02 "Sliidddeeee some oil to me!" -Why is this song in my head rn?
5090 2018-12-04 16:44:02 Em, the majority of tar sands oil is exported to the US.
5091 2018-12-04 16:43:57 Modi ji is using his US connections to alter oil prices according to his need

You obviously don't live here or know a damn thing about O&G.
It's cyclical. People who bet on Eagle Ford are OUT OF WORK NOW.
After the 80s boom/bust, a popular bumper sticker read "Dear God, please give us another oil boom and I promise not to waste it this time"
We know
5095 2018-12-04 16:43:42 Yes 429k$ from oil corps + oil executives. is that what u r trying to say?
5096 2018-12-04 16:43:38 The Witcher:
It was a cold day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  White Wolfs. 'Use  Beast Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
5097 2018-12-04 16:43:29 Today 3ppl have asked me "what you got on it smells nice" n I said nothing but thanks not realizing it's my hair Lls Rose oil big dawg 
5098 2018-12-04 16:43:21 Can someone who works there NOT, I REPEAT NOT, confirm whether fillet o fish is cooked in the same oil as everything else 

Behave yourselves and don’t ruin my life ... safe xx 
5099 2018-12-04 16:43:15 Thankfully many others had the tariff man, oil man thought before I did.
5100 2018-12-04 16:43:09 Ok, this is something that should be talked about; not bloody fuel tax. If your lifestyle depends on cheap oil, your lifestyle is wrong.
5101 2018-12-04 16:43:07 Not to mention that there are literally thousands of liberal oil and gas employees across the state.
5102 2018-12-04 16:42:58 Looking for that "dream" part-time job? Week days and weekends in Glenview & Libertyville, 11-5. Come work with an outstanding team helping customers to learn to use healthy olive oil in their cooking! Previous sales & computer knowledge experience a plus.
5103 2018-12-04 16:42:52 See, we used to shout "GET YER SOSHALIST PAWS OFF OUR OIL INDUSTRY" but then we realized that while we are screaming for more access to markets, too much of our oil is getting to markets, so we've agreed with th<hurk>.. sorry hang on... we've agreed<hurk> nope can't do it #ableg
5104 2018-12-04 16:42:52 Washington is reportedly considering legal claims against OPEC for allegedly manipulating the energy market. If passed, the proposed No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act —  referred to as NOPEC — revoke immunity that has long shielded OPEC from U.S. legal action.
5105 2018-12-04 16:42:51 Neither are oil/gas workers but Sirota didn’t care (and if you start your pretend trolling re this, I’m going to lose it today bc it’s just not funny, Sandwich)
5106 2018-12-04 16:42:44 what am I missing here? he is in oil and gas country TEXAS?!
5107 2018-12-04 16:42:30 Big Oil is behind #climate alarm, which is why they don't raise context about the issue, #fakenews requires fake debate or the bubble pops, all you need to do to realize this is look into whats said, many aspects fall apart under scrutiny bc they are propaganda! try harder!
5108 2018-12-04 16:42:27 Silly is the best oil to keep societal interaction running smoothly.
#Probably
5109 2018-12-04 16:42:25 The French clean air program make Crude oil products so expensive that people starve,  Al Gore would agree with that,  so will most Democrats in this country !
5110 2018-12-04 16:42:23 Sounds very uncomfortable and painful ,that's bad. Have u tried cannabis oil and the new capsules? They now sell those over the counter at pharmacies here in London
5111 2018-12-04 16:42:20 i still believe he had something nefarious to do with the Gulf Coast oil rigs blowing up - payback to Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi for being red states
5112 2018-12-04 16:42:17 Strength, coal oil & steel industries back up & running, our boarder being protected, and much much more! I'd say America is great again!!!
But there's always more that can be done...
5113 2018-12-04 16:42:11 Let's follow the logic here. The individual donors who contributed to Beto's campaign are donating because they like his positions on oil and gas industry. If he was to advocate for divesting from the oil and gas industry, he won't be getting those contributions would he?
5114 2018-12-04 16:42:10 I recommend Games workshop citadel Nuln oil and Agrax earthshade.
Shit's like skill in a bottle
5115 2018-12-04 16:42:06 Wow - I admire your tenacity to try and break out of the cycle.
Have you tried CBD oil? 
Btw- I don’t think there’s anything that will work 100%
5116 2018-12-04 16:41:50 Constant dog whistling with you. GM itself is blaming the US for the closure of its 5 facilities, one of which is Oshawa. OPEC has been increasing oil output looking to devalue US stockpiles, Notley demanding production cuts is unfortunate but based on external issues.
5117 2018-12-04 16:41:43 Psalm 45: 6 - 7 "6 Your throne, God, is forever and ever; the scepter of Your kingdom is a scepter of justice. 7 You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy..." (Prophecy of Jesus' throne being anointed and eternal)
5118 2018-12-04 16:41:35 Today's youtube odyssey has led me from soundtracks (Treasure Planet and Atlantis) through carols (Down in Yon Forest, Cherry Tree Carol, Tomorrow Shall Be My Dancing Day), hymns (Give Me Oil In My Lamp) and on to Men of Harlech (English and Welsh) and the Welsh national anthem.
5119 2018-12-04 16:41:23 “Guess which pair of your boxers I doused in ghost pepper oil.”
5120 2018-12-04 16:41:16 @MaximeBernier Trudeau has had a terrible effect on the economy & won’t rest until the oil industry is dead. But bcs the NDP is unpopular these days, Libs will keep the votes on the left. You’ll take from CPC. History will remember you as the one who ensured Trudeau would stay.
5121 2018-12-04 16:41:14 Federal Offices closed for No war for oil movement  on December 5th
5122 2018-12-04 16:41:14 The American, Russian, & Saudi oligarchs must protect their oil.
5123 2018-12-04 16:41:13 They're unfortunately not morons Brian. They're getting bribes and kickbacksfrom coal and oil bosses.
5124 2018-12-04 16:41:09 Like you guys pay the continent of Africa and it's countries. You know. The ones you rape and pillage on a near yearly basis. Diamonds minerals gold. And of course the big one oil. Keeping corrupt dictators in power so you can pay as little as possible. Hypocrisy is sickening.
5125 2018-12-04 16:41:09 Socialism is a great idea, it is not a great reality. 
People are starving in #Venezuela  an oil rich country. It is beyond curious to me @Ocasio2018 & @BernieSanders insistence that socialist ideas will work this time. #retrogresssion

5128 2018-12-04 16:40:42 Oh really? What does that mean, besides "reviving a moribund congressional committee to study the issue?" She favors it as she favors higher defense budgets? She favors it while letting the @DCCC raise money from oil & gas interests? Talk is cheap. Money talks.
5129 2018-12-04 16:40:37 Your pro oil stance is a lie.  Note that you masters, Butt and Junior, are on record...and intend to shut down the fossil fuel industry entirely.

5132 2018-12-04 16:40:21 Developers also supported Nancy Floreen in Montgomery County, who got crushed by Marc Elrich. Small donors worked just fine for Beto in a state (TX) where big oil and gas rich guys dominate donations to politicians. The problem was Hogan’s mystifying popularity.
5133 2018-12-04 16:40:20 Hahah. Ok, bud. I reviewed 25 different products from the LDB, all of which I paid for myself.

Jamie agrees, as does every smoker I have spoken to that tried it.

But you saw some oil reviewed in another country, so it is legit?

5135 2018-12-04 16:40:14 Every time I try to schedule an appt with my dealer for an oil change there’s a problem. & they take mad long to do it 
5136 2018-12-04 16:40:13 BLESSED AND HIGHLY FAVORED IS JUST A HOLIER THAN THOU WAY OF SAYING, NAN NAN NA BOO BOO. LMAO. AINT NOTHING SLICK TO A CAN OF OIL. I SEE U TALKING SHIT, SISTER MARTHA. LMAO.

5138 2018-12-04 16:40:02 Really weird getting an email from a university that doesn’t believe in chronic Lyme saying that garlic oil kills Lyme bacteria...the cognitive dissonance wtf
5139 2018-12-04 16:40:01 The government of GHANA really want to pound very hard on those prophets. They are saying their government is considering taxing prophets anointing oil and other items that they sell. This one is a very good move
5140 2018-12-04 16:39:51 What about ''IRAN'' Now that Saudi's and Putins got your balls in the fire. Their going to control oil prices $48 BB HA HA
5141 2018-12-04 16:39:48 When will you release your 2019 schedule?
5142 2018-12-04 16:39:45 TRUDEAUS words Are.. those men who work in the oil sector are now Sex perverts
5143 2018-12-04 16:39:44 I'm so paranoid in using oil on my oily skin 
5144 2018-12-04 16:39:34 Have you tried Toby with Rick Simpson oil yet?
I'm sorry it the suggestion offends but it has been curing people all over the world. My thoughts are with you little man. Such a warrior.xxxx
5145 2018-12-04 16:39:19 "Large Agenda groups" you mean every single science organization on Earth, right? "
"$$ pays for weak science" you mean the teaching salaries of researchers compared to oil&gas consultants? 
"Co2 alarm" see IPCC summary 5.
5146 2018-12-04 16:39:17 Thing is if a person takes $100,000 in large dollar donations from oil executives, is that enough to be friendly to big oil? How much oil money does it take to buy a politician? That can lead to corruption real quick.
5147 2018-12-04 16:39:13 If Ming not mistaken weaker dollar hurt Russian income from oil exports while rising US intrest rates hurts emerging markets (RUS)
5148 2018-12-04 16:39:12 Reeks of snake oil...
5149 2018-12-04 16:39:05 Finish with butter but the initial sear sun flower oil because it has a higher smoking point and has a neutral flavor
5150 2018-12-04 16:39:01 Also 2018: Obama bragging about making the US the largest producer of oil and gas.

5152 2018-12-04 16:38:46 Why are we importing oil, use our resources in our own country.
5153 2018-12-04 16:38:28 Caution prevails imo. Even if global oil prices jump. People are sick of this whipsaw. This goes for US shale guys too.
5154 2018-12-04 16:38:14 แกคาดหวังหรอออย

5156 2018-12-04 16:37:54 Look: Big Boss Vladimir presides over a large, poor, aging country with oil in hard to reach places, lots of alcoholics, declining birth right, lots of Muslims on its periphery who nyet get along with the Orthodox, and nuclear weapons. Nyet strong hand, but he has played it well.
5157 2018-12-04 16:37:50 Let me go get this oil change my shit overdue
5158 2018-12-04 16:37:48 We walk in the shop and find Lug Nut sliding up and down the Oil Hose.  It's hard to find good help these days!
5159 2018-12-04 16:37:45 Don’t mind the coconut oil on my face LOL
5160 2018-12-04 16:37:43 La solidaridad es un atributo importante. Como cuando Chávez donó vivienda a Brooklyn...
5161 2018-12-04 16:37:40 You can blame Trump for the increase in fuel prices since it was his idea to pull out of the Iran Deal against the advice of France, Britain, and Germany. Iran cut production and oil prices increased, it's called supply and demand, but you want the man who created the problem. 
5162 2018-12-04 16:37:21 She said come here lemme change your brakes and your oil  oh so you tryna be my GIRLFRIEND girlfriend
5163 2018-12-04 16:37:16 春みたいな温度なのに花粉飛んでなくて最高だった。
5164 2018-12-04 16:37:08 11:37am 04DEC currently *NO WAIT* For State Inspections, oil change, alignment, diagnostic, why wait when there is a Carmasters Vehicle Available at Carmasters Automotive for you to drive while yours is getting repaired (please schedule) #inspection #alignment #battery #oilchange
5165 2018-12-04 16:37:04 Before working for Netroots Nation I was employed by Chevron (they bought the engineering firm where I worked). I was personall responsible for the oil and gas donation that Howard Dean reported early in the cycle.
5166 2018-12-04 16:37:03 Wow 15 minutes on my Bowflex Max Trainer and felt good the entire time.

First time doing 15 minutes on the max trainer, must because of the miracle oil i started on Saturday..

Muscles are relaxed instead of knots..:D <3
5167 2018-12-04 16:37:02 Why is it “poor quality”?Heavy feedstock gets refined to more products than light feedstock.The price issue is a repressive government game they play with bans & restrictions that they do not apply to foreign oil flowing into Canada.  Have #jihadijustin put tariffs on foreign oil
5168 2018-12-04 16:37:00 @used_engines_ Aren't oil pan needed to make an engine run? my definition of an accessory part would be an ac condenser. Your customer service is horrible too!
5169 2018-12-04 16:36:58 تدوم يا رايق
5170 2018-12-04 16:36:51 I even googled if the Black sea had oil, turns out it did, and I just fed my own dreams. So you're saying they're still in a good economic position? Still a missed opportunity imo
5171 2018-12-04 16:36:49 Stop drilling, you've struck oil.
5172 2018-12-04 16:36:37 They are ruthless cynics drunk with fading power. Like defeated Saddam setting the oil fields in Kuwait afire, or vindictive Hitler torching Germany.
5173 2018-12-04 16:36:37 Total brake job, main seal, all four axle seals, catalytic converter, and a few other things. Burns some oil, but gets decent fuel mileage and is paid for so I’ll keep it.
5174 2018-12-04 16:36:28 Red oil
5175 2018-12-04 16:36:28 #TakeYourSeat We want renewable energy. We want less plastic packaging. We want the end of palm oil driven deforestation. We want sustainable fisheries. When do we want this? NOW. You can’t keep on having conferences every year and not do anything. It can’t be all talk no action.
5176 2018-12-04 16:36:16 It does. I use that oil stuff which cleans out your nose a treat. I can't remember what it's called.
5177 2018-12-04 16:36:13 Men will soon need to dress in drag.  After all the ALTA NDP called Oil & Gas workers #SewerRats & now Trudeau hammers them for causing Social problems in communities, while he was on the international stage no less.  Tough time to be a man!
5178 2018-12-04 16:36:05 Not to be confused with Lead Fest, the annual party oil execs throw to award those who put the most carcinogens into local drinking water supplies.
5179 2018-12-04 16:36:00 Put a tariff on foreign oil then. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain by making #AmericaFirst and giving us energy independence.  We don’t need no stinking foreign oil!
5180 2018-12-04 16:35:58 By the way, you'll have to click on the image to find the Oil and Gas line. That's how low it is on the list.
5181 2018-12-04 16:35:51 sorry if i don't trust your review.  there is a youtuber who reviewed an aphria branded oil through Liberty Health Sciences in FL and it was legit.  i would trust a video before i trust a tweet
5182 2018-12-04 16:35:50 You’re aware senate terms are 6 years, yes? Back to the thesis: people who work in oil industry contributing to someone who supports green energy is counter intuitive bcuz the candidate would like to wean the US off fossil fuels. See how dumb that sounds?
5183 2018-12-04 16:35:44 I love the nyx dropper foundation when I add in a few drops of the tarte maracuja oil. I haven't found a good primer but I love the Clinique moisture surge intense to moisturize before foundation.
5184 2018-12-04 16:35:42 I think fire weed, oil and sugar wax in a blunt is better at least that’s my favorite. Kief is good to roll it in too.
5185 2018-12-04 16:35:34 @used_engines Since when is an oil pan considered an accessory part? Mine came with a hole in and it was crushed. 
Accessory
noun
1.
a thing that can be added to something else in order to make it more useful, versatile, or attractive.
5186 2018-12-04 16:35:25 Doctor sahib, this news of large oil reserves in Pak comes up every 10 years. First one I recall was announced by PM ZAB in assembly regsrding big find in Dhodhak. Let’s give it a rest till something actually happens.
5187 2018-12-04 16:35:25 I had literally no oil in my car
5188 2018-12-04 16:35:17 If we had true leadership in each and every government sectors.Loadshedding was not going to be a solution.Quality of COAL that is fed to our power station is poor. That leads our power station to even burn oil to stabilize the boiler furnace.
5189 2018-12-04 16:35:02 yeah sure, a guy who takes part in riots is automatically smarter? those idiots can‘t even think one step ahead but sure, let‘s give dump people their cheap oil - an infinite resource as we all know - to raise popularity and stay in charge...oh wait 
5190 2018-12-04 16:34:49 CAPITAL AMEN SIR.
Thanks 4 the power conference.
I have not recovered from it and I don't which to
I believe in God,You, the grace, Anointing,oil and Divine Presence of God you carry.
My prayer is this
#LET_WHAT_WORKS_4_U
#WORK_4_ME.Even on my Album project in JESUS NAME. AMEN..
5191 2018-12-04 16:34:43 That’s the definition of insanity. How did we allow this regression in our energy policy. Coal and oil subsidies, renewable energy no fed government subsidy. Insane.
5192 2018-12-04 16:34:43 NCT DREAM NEEDS TO STOP ACTING LIKE MARK IS QUITTING HIS JOB AS AN IDOL THEY NEED TO STOP ADDING OIL TO THE FIRE BECAUSE I WILL START WAILING
5193 2018-12-04 16:34:33 I would imagine that there are a lot of oil and gas industry employees in Texas. Beto didn't take corp or PAC money from what I understand
5194 2018-12-04 16:34:24 kiz sand is a really benefiting proffesion
it almost like oil, big apartamant  complexes house all need a specific kind of sand gotten from the seaa 
5195 2018-12-04 16:34:18 Nice pull back in oil today for ya!
5196 2018-12-04 16:34:08 Maybe we actually have to pay to keep the globe safe.  I know that there are hundreds of abandoned oil wells in this country that are going to cost taxpayers hundreds of millions to clean up. Who else will pay?
5197 2018-12-04 16:34:07 If I responded to every email, I’d probably have the best home and auto insurance and a warehouse full of non-FDA approved CBD oil
5198 2018-12-04 16:34:00 My man. If you Vai, red oil should be default
5199 2018-12-04 16:33:58 same, oil drilling is more exciting than freaking sand. They're not even that rich 
5200 2018-12-04 16:33:54 And many of the orange snake oil drinkers are losing what’s left of their minds!!! Go AOC!!
5201 2018-12-04 16:33:53 Hi, 
Several of my customers have been delighted with my CBD Oil products. Many are experiencing pain free days, less anxiety and a better quality of life. If you are curious about CBD and would like to know more about it and how it may help please drop me a message #painrelief
5202 2018-12-04 16:33:50 i hate oil men in town yc!
5203 2018-12-04 16:33:44 like, this isn't necessarily about level of education - I know people who were driven out of, for instance, oil, despite working at a very high technical level, because it's a masculine coded profession, after transitioning
5204 2018-12-04 16:33:41 Sub-committee on Petroleum examined recruitment of locals and social welfare schemes under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) obligations by oil and gas exploration and production companies operating in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with reference to Districts Kohat and Karak”.
5205 2018-12-04 16:33:32 Pumping more oil requires capital, which is noticeably absent in Alberta
5206 2018-12-04 16:33:32 Let me ask you do you have natural oil for deed skin oil for face
5207 2018-12-04 16:33:15 How will this cut affect employment?  
Or when the price comes up does it get people working again or without layoffs? So much depends on this oil so I am so hopeful of this plan!  I have two adult boys trying to get stable employment in trades so always watching 
5208 2018-12-04 16:33:14 Lmao look sh8 I see already
5209 2018-12-04 16:33:11 No, this means that there are regular people who work in oil that wanted to contribute. If you’re an accountant in Houston, odds are you’ll work in the oil industry. If you contribute to Beto will you accuse that person of trying to influence some specific agenda related to oil?
5210 2018-12-04 16:33:08 Why would people dig for sand the bottom of the sea. In my mind oil seemed more exciting. I thought Tahir was one of those rich oligarchs  surrounded by money and females
5211 2018-12-04 16:33:05 I do not trust that food air dryer. I feel like people who use that can't cook.
I need that Wesson oil piping hot on my catfish
5212 2018-12-04 16:33:02 Clear glass? Rain pattern? Obscure pattern? Nature pattern? You want chrome, brush nickel, oil rubber bronze, or brass hardware & towel bars? Got measurements for opening?
5213 2018-12-04 16:32:42 Hang on... I made the first comment coz I thought u were embracing monsters. After watching the trailer it seems to be an environment message disguised and using the mighty Godzilla! FFS can’t we have a monster movie without a PC message. It’s too Midnight Oil. Let Godzilla rock!
5214 2018-12-04 16:32:33 Voila making $$ that's the only thing I care about in Oil. Congratz. Have a nice day and Good luck! I am looking to cover shorts in the Gap and Buy.
5215 2018-12-04 16:32:26 Kaylee just sent me a tweet to tell me to get a oil change... HOW did she know from 8 hrs away I was gonna need to hear that 
5216 2018-12-04 16:32:25 The parking lot of my office building is filled with bags of rice and cartons of oil.
5217 2018-12-04 16:32:21 get your face damp (just pay with wet hands) and rub your moisturizer, serum, oil in & it literally stays in ALL day and doesn’t make you look greasy at all. Makes your face feel soft & velvety
5218 2018-12-04 16:32:18 ありがとうございます！

5220 2018-12-04 16:32:11 @JPOnYourRadio I just got in the car and heard part of your CBD oil story. Can you forward some information on the oil please. Suffering from arthritis at 51 years old.
5221 2018-12-04 16:32:04 If your face is oily don't load it up with pressed powder which will block your pores and produce oil and acne! Soak up oil with tissue.
5222 2018-12-04 16:31:46 Finally an oil change
5223 2018-12-04 16:31:40 Disagree on what? The issues they are causing? Or the fact that they are, undeniably, rich, working in the oil industry, or own a corporation?
5224 2018-12-04 16:31:26 And UAE Oil
5225 2018-12-04 16:31:23 *Lots of oil industry employees. More proportionally and in absolute numbers than pretty much all states
5226 2018-12-04 16:31:23 We brought the price of Gas down $2/gal and started the disclosure that American Oil & Gas has unreported and hoarded it's excess supply. Largest in World. DEADLY FRACKING is UNNECESSARY! Saudi Arabia is not needed.

5229 2018-12-04 16:31:09 Perhaps Slippery Hillary and take Fake credit for our good economy and oil production Obama should follow your "move over" advice.
5230 2018-12-04 16:31:07 Thunder vest and/or CBD oil dog treats. I have a strong pit bull with similar issues & I combine the two.
5231 2018-12-04 16:31:03 Are offshore oil and gas licenses a devolved power to Holyrood?  From a quick search, it appears that only onshore licences (e.g. fracking) are devolved to Scotland.  But, I agree, no new oil and gas extraction is certainly a prerequisite to lead by example.
5232 2018-12-04 16:31:00 She has been fighting for a pipeline, we must read different newspapers,    oil is a global commodity, always has been.
5233 2018-12-04 16:30:57 You're implying something that's not true. In a state where the largest employer is big oil, individuals who work for big oil (like the clerk in the corner gas station) donated to his campaign. Nothing from corporate.

OTOH, Bernie's LaPierre/NRA endorsements bear scrutiny.

5236 2018-12-04 16:30:40 I saw a tweet about how they used motor oil as syrup in ads. I never knew that. i always wondered why it looked so perfect haha. It all makes sense now! #gpc109

5239 2018-12-04 16:30:36 Ned asks "Which point?"

I don't think your application of the Ideal Gas Law to planetary atmospheres is going to solve the existential problem that crude oil is a finite non-renewable resource. IOW, the thread has moved on from your silliness

5242 2018-12-04 16:30:25 What do finance and defense have to do with climate change and the oil/gas industry?
5243 2018-12-04 16:30:22 Reasons for my Bah humbug! 
1. Car #1 leaking oil                                           
2. Car #2 transmission slipping 
3. Pool pump cracked
4. Property taxes
5. Husband leaving for a week leaving me with no car. 
6. Still have Christmas shopping to do.
7. December is $$$$$
5244 2018-12-04 16:30:13 lol this is shockingly naïve. Oil companies have already requested fed funds to build their oil wells above the projected sea level rise. They have no intention of quitting even tho that's what needs to happen. The owners of industry have not and will never share your interests.
5245 2018-12-04 16:30:00 Gained +13.22% sell position on WCX $Brent Crude Oil 20x leverage @ 62.178 → 61.767  ~ OOOULALA $BCO $USD
5246 2018-12-04 16:29:59 Neera, educating the public on who is funding any politician should be public knowledge no matter what party. If Beto is the #2 recipient of campaign money from oil/gas, then that's information voters may not have known. Let the truth be known.
5247 2018-12-04 16:29:55 Hi Janet, thank you for sending this over. We are working on this with the EA at the moment to try and get the oil removed. Hopefully you will notice a difference soon -Amy

5249 2018-12-04 16:29:48 Alka Mittal has become Director(Human resources) of Oil and Natural Gas(ONGC).She will be the 1st full time Woman director.
So far,she was serving as Chief of skill development(CSD).She is the only also woman full time Member in the board of directors.Well,congratulations to her
5250 2018-12-04 16:29:42 if you want higher price for Alberta oil which benefits all of Canada , stop the oil coming in to the east from the east , and watch how fast the Montreal mayor will be begging for a pipe line to the east

5252 2018-12-04 16:29:38 No it was a small trade
And it was trading at 0.25-0.35p back then at the time with the wide spread and non existent liquidity
RBD was just a shell with ~£1.8M Mcap prior to Sep2017 with few big oil shares traded to keep the listing
5253 2018-12-04 16:29:32 Ik this is long but I brush, oil and braid my hair every night and it’s grown so much longer and softer andd doesn’t break anymore
5254 2018-12-04 16:29:23 Kinda, yeah.  Did I miss it?  What has he said/done?  I can't fault a TX politician for accepting donations from oil & gas executives in Texas during a historic senate race, but I will withdraw support for his presidential run if he doesn't truly support clean energy.
5255 2018-12-04 16:29:19 Amer need to brake Stranglehold Big Oil on ourDemocracy. End to Citizen United. Less then 10 People decide our Nation's Leadership>Governing Body.

5256 2018-12-04 16:29:17 That’s what happens when you dance with @JustinTrudeau and scream how much you hate oil! Too little to late @RachelNotley
5257 2018-12-04 16:29:13 Iran may be the more trustworthy oil producer rather than OPEC + Russia.

A pesar de que durante los últimos 4 años, muchos productores de Shale Oil se vieron forzados a salir del mercado, otros han logrado resistir
5260 2018-12-04 16:28:40 Well, no. Initially Exxon fought tooth and nail against AGW theory and we have their internal emails to show that they knew that they were lying to the public.

A scientist who could disprove AGW would be a hero to the oil and gas industry. It would be a ticket to instant fame.

5266 2018-12-04 16:28:09 You think oil company CEOs and executives giving the *maximum* legal donation to a candidate, resulting in that candidate ending up raking in more money from that industry than anybody, equates to “small dollar donations”.

You are what’s wrong with our system.
5267 2018-12-04 16:28:05 The oil market entered a downward spiral in early October, and by the end of November, oil prices hit record lows, with Brent crude falling below $62 a barrel.
In East Africa however, it's the opposite! @pwatchug @mkainerugaba @RebeccaKadaga @JacobOulanyah @TamaleMirundi
5268 2018-12-04 16:27:56 I mean he's a congressmen from Texas.  I'd expect this.

Fair reporting but as liberals we have to put these donations in context. Dems need to raise money also. Texas has oil. NJ has Pharma. This is exactly what they did to Booker.

Don't be naive. Get rid of ALL Dark Money.

5270 2018-12-04 16:27:42 There are better ways to implement a carbon tax and better ways to spend it
Should be on oil corporation profits,  (that may be hard now since we lost control of OPEC now thanks to the great deal maker)
Should be spent in grants to home owners for home conversion to green power

5307 2018-12-04 16:25:11 HARD laugh at this. Rejecting oil $ is an infeasible task. Got it.
5308 2018-12-04 16:25:01 America funds terrorism, they plough money in proxy wars, doing it in Syria, done it in Afghanistan, when the Russians were fighting them years ago. If they were so bothered then why have they never stepped in Zimbabwe?, No oil......
5309 2018-12-04 16:24:55 I think it depends. Did the companies or industry lobbyists get meetings w Beto on the strength of those individual donations? That would be good reporting. But noting that some oil rig roughneck gave Beto $100 and calling that part of industry support is just a smear.
5310 2018-12-04 16:24:53 Unbelievable .................anything but anything to block oil transports.

5326 2018-12-04 16:24:09 Okay. Thanks for the info. Looks like far too much oil to do much good.
5327 2018-12-04 16:23:52 If you really are concerned, why not dig up dirt on the groups blocking the pipelines including the first nations groups? Uncover the foreign influence in environmental groups and the bands. The Saudis do not want us to exploit our own oil.
5328 2018-12-04 16:23:46 This reminds me of a mechanic I knew. He said you can change your oil now and it cost a little, or you can wait and have your engine blow which costs a whole lot more. Now, which sounds smarter?
5329 2018-12-04 16:23:41 You are living in the clouds. Seen global oil demand growth? Seen BMO revised Cdn economic growth for next year. Huge slash to Q1 CANADIAN GDP growth due to oil curtailments in AB. Not a real economy?
5330 2018-12-04 16:23:34 What is tsp?  I’ve used Simple Green in the kitchen but you have to rinse or it leaves  a cloudy residue. I also like Murphy’s Oil Soap. The Mr. Clean erasers are useless and fall apart
5331 2018-12-04 16:23:32 How can we change leadership when the youths sell their future for a bag of rice and gallon of oil? Ppl need to wake up. Hold politicians to higher standard than taking bribe to vote for them
5332 2018-12-04 16:23:31 The Alberta oil output curtailment plan exempts producers pumping fewer than 10 kbpd—given that these firms will receive considerably higher revenues w no prod controls, how much more can they pump vs baseline, eroding some of the headline prov reductions?

Employees of the oil/gas industry giving small donations to Beto is what is represented in this number! There are so many of these employees in Texas who obviously wanted Cruz voted out of office!

5346 2018-12-04 16:21:58 “The oil” (hashemen) has the same letters as “soul” (neshama). The Greeks wanted to defile the Jewish soul.  They didn’t want to destroy the Jews like Titus & Haman & other murderous oppressors, but to defile us by implanting alien cultures and provocative ideas of heresy in us.

5352 2018-12-04 16:21:36 As you well know, those are from EMPLOYEES who work in the oil industry (overall leader in employment in the state). The fact employees, like the clerk at the corner gas station, contributed to him and the corporate offices did not does indeed tell you a lot about #Beto.
5353 2018-12-04 16:21:35 Yup... Imagine being baffled in a state where four out of the top five employers are oil and gas companies that the constituents of said state donating to a candidate would happen to be employed by oil and gas companies. Sirota is being disingenuous at best.

5358 2018-12-04 16:21:13 Sincere question, why does this vote not matter? I assume you believe in climate change. We just got a UN climate science report that gives us 12 years to cease fossil fuel production and go carbon-free requiring mass divestment from oil/gas. His vote is very scary at this time.
5359 2018-12-04 16:21:07 I wonder if the essential oil people literally sell snake oil

5361 2018-12-04 16:20:46 Two miracles occurred. The first — the miracle of the victory in the war of the many and the strong versus the weak and the few. And the second — the miracle of the oil.
5362 2018-12-04 16:20:46 i think in the aggregate it's meaningful - if in texas, a ton of oil people donate a lot of money to a guy who's oil friendly, that says something. if only a few people in the finance industry donate to AOC, the fact that it's only a few also says something

5365 2018-12-04 16:20:37 "We use 100 million barrels of oil a day" – that's insanity. Greed has replaced forethought. Let the kids take over now.
5366 2018-12-04 16:20:37 If the Trump administration keeps opening up more land and coastline to development, oil exploration, and mining climate change will be worse.  The administration cares more about how much money they can make than the future generations wellbeing and care of our planet.

5368 2018-12-04 16:20:34 Marc Rich was pardoned by Bill Clinton. There was an investigation into Clinton and Rich and shady OIL dealings. Investigation was headed by female who later got replaced by James Comey. Found no wrong doing on Clinton's part.

5375 2018-12-04 16:20:09 Of course not. There are decent people in every industry - banking, oil, agribusiness...what Sirota is attempting to do is conflate an entire despised industry with the individuals who make that industry up. It’s incredibly cynical and disingenuous.

5389 2018-12-04 16:18:58 yes. that is a risk. my high priests won't listen to me. the obvious solution is to disband an oil company, but everyone has knee-jerk reactions to that. maybe you could help me get through to them that it is easy and legal to retract business licenses from large corporations.

5398 2018-12-04 16:18:34 OPEC now, is different from its inception which was an oil organization. now is a political Mafia. its leader has a visible bloody hand and has no shame to cover it, from the other hand it become a political puppy for the large powers like Russia and USA. this is the beginning.

5400 2018-12-04 16:18:27 @JustinTrudeau so you can give away $50million to non Canadians but can't even support our veterans!? Seriously that's brutal. And you say our oil Feild and construction workers have negative impacts on women and communities? Seriously that's just wrong.
5401 2018-12-04 16:18:21 Depends on how thick it’s laid on. Oil paint can take days/weeks to fully dry.
5402 2018-12-04 16:18:13 The Elf on the Shelf tried to sell me a dimes worth of CBD oil for $50.

the Elf on the Shelf was wired.

Bah. Humbug.
5403 2018-12-04 16:18:02 The good news is I got my beautiful writing *space* with bookcases &tables &candles. Bad news is I’m also a clay sculptor & oil painter & that’s in the other part of the artist *space* Jekyll & Hyde working together. I love it  #amwriting #painting #writercommunity #art

5407 2018-12-04 16:17:43 Stocks and oil surge after US-China trade war truce
5408 2018-12-04 16:17:37 Haha. For those of us that actually know who the voters in Texas are, I took those numbers as impressive. Texas is never turning blue if we keep running senate candidates that can’t raise money from oil company employees. In some areas of TX, that’s damn near everyone.
5409 2018-12-04 16:17:31 2.5x 2019 E EBITDA for $HPR.  Which top tier #Permians are you putting in the sub 4x category?
5410 2018-12-04 16:17:19 @JustinTrudeau why don’t you pass legislation to build energy east and trans mountain now then trim a royalty off the oil that flows to market ~$1-5 and put that directly towards renewable energy? #ThinkOutsideTheBox #WCS
5411 2018-12-04 16:17:19 Yep. Oil and gas employee here. I voted for Beto. Every employee that I speak politics with (and some I don’t) openly supported Beto.
5412 2018-12-04 16:17:15 The US economy now consumes 0.4 barrels of oil to produce $1000 of GDP down from 1.1 in 1972
5413 2018-12-04 16:17:09 Gotta love getting a oil change
5414 2018-12-04 16:16:54 *frantic dripping of oil sap*

5416 2018-12-04 16:16:48 I get such a snake oil salesman vibe and I cannot get ENOUGH of it
5417 2018-12-04 16:16:47 Trying to get rid of this scented oil smell in my room. Cause it’s giving me a headache. put yu yee oil on nose also still can smell it sia.
5418 2018-12-04 16:16:43 Butterflied king prawns with a lemon, lime and chilli oil, skinny chips and a salad. 
5419 2018-12-04 16:16:43 Tea Tree oil came through last night!!!!!! OKURR! 
5420 2018-12-04 16:16:43 @tvcnewsng Fed. gov't should investigate and confirm the real amount of the subsidy arrears and settle the Oil marketers, the average man always bear the pains. #JH
5421 2018-12-04 16:16:38 But living in oil-rich Texas isn’t an excuse anymore. Change the convo. I lived near Georgetown for a few years and I can tell you there’s a real reason Texas is no. 1 in wind. There’s NO reason oil and gas can’t convert to green energy jobs.
5422 2018-12-04 16:16:38 Ik what you really mean
5423 2018-12-04 16:16:33 If your face can't handle any type of oil as a moisturizer I feel very sorry for you because putting squalane oil on my face is an exceptionally pleasurable experience.
5424 2018-12-04 16:16:30 Oh well done Mark ..me , you and Uncle Stephen on our little oil
journey. Let's hope we start to see lots of tankers!
Make sure you follow @Adrianwfire  as well as @WealdOilers for all the updates.

5426 2018-12-04 16:16:24 Your first sentence is what I needed someone to state for a fact.  I agree with your second and third sentences whole-heartedly.  My only question would be being an executive at an oil/gas company is incompatible with having progressive values?  No snark, serious question.
5427 2018-12-04 16:16:22 I have a theory that this is tied to Saudi oil and Clintons. There's a money trail and cover up. Start w Kingdom Holding Co and its founder Saudi prince Alwaleed( recent child pedo investigation). KHC has big American stocks, Twitter for example.
5428 2018-12-04 16:16:21 Witchy tip: wash down your front door with warm water and a little essential oil of mint, to refresh the vibrations and welcome in luck, abundance, and wealth. No mint oil? Peppermint tea works just as well 
5429 2018-12-04 16:16:18 I am not understanding
5430 2018-12-04 16:16:18 Well, since you claim that they get paid big bucks by the oil industry if they ‘could factually dispute AGW’ - it means that they factually dispute.
Of course Exxon is on board with AGW scam: all corps. recognize the power of the mob and take the path of least resistance
5431 2018-12-04 16:16:17 now now, the dif between the cost to produce a barrel of oil and the price of it, if ur house economy is based on the sale of apples, and you sell 100 apples a months at $10 you r making $1000, but if by next month the price is 1/2, you will make just $500, is not rocket science
5432 2018-12-04 16:16:15 It took many millions of years to develop a store of CO2 in oil and coal from plants and animals    Humans have been releasing (burning) this store CO2 over the past few decades.   The diagram that you show is very simplistic.    Who produced this diagram?
5433 2018-12-04 16:16:11 My hybrid cannabis oil means more to me than Linus's security blanket means to him.
5434 2018-12-04 16:16:09 1) My critique of original DS tweet stands 2) His (later) clarification should've been in the original tweet, as I noted 3) I assume DS will soon be highlighting similarity of Sanders on NRA/guns issues & Sanders' contributions from hunters in Vermont, to Beto's oil/gas money?
5435 2018-12-04 16:16:04 You’re weird, did you know climate scientists work in the oil and gas industry?
5436 2018-12-04 16:16:03 How much oil money does it take to buy a politician. This becomes a slippery slope real quick.
5437 2018-12-04 16:16:02 This intrigued me because the largest carbon intensive industry in Scotland is the oil and gas industry and attempts to transition away from that are almost non existent..
5438 2018-12-04 16:15:51 Beard Oil and balm something where I made products in the past. A good niche also
5439 2018-12-04 16:15:48 No, it means that people that work in the gas/oil industry in Texas get behind Beto's poilcies enough to support him. But I don't need to explain Occam's razor to you.
5440 2018-12-04 16:15:45 I doubt it. - I had a sapphire ring I made flagged as well, and my oil painting of Leonardo da Vinci. It’s just dumb. They are not going to be able to cope with the flood of review requests, and having stuff wrongly flagged in the future all the time is not beneficial for anyone.
5441 2018-12-04 16:15:41 Oh creepy Google... You never let us down. Racing to the bottom! Hope to see another Standard Oil, Bell System like antitrust soon!
5442 2018-12-04 16:15:41 You should be terrified at the debt overhang and the effect on this economy especially when the next dip in oil prices comes around.
5443 2018-12-04 16:15:39 They can all live in Wisconsin, Alabama and Ohio. We can build three massive walls around them, and Mexico will pay for them using money from Chinese tariffs and Saudi oil subsidies.
5444 2018-12-04 16:15:30 Sadly the only thing you ''have'' is oil... And expensive and dirty oil at that. The futur for oil is not great so as time goes by you will shrink and eventually you're gonna be seriously broke... That why you needed to start diversifying 10 years ago.
5445 2018-12-04 16:15:26 An engaging and very positive week for Proforest staff, with the new P&C being a huge success. Thank you for the dedication and support towards making sustainable palm oil the norm.
5446 2018-12-04 16:15:20 いいから黙ってytrのCR夢追い人を聞けっね言っといた。有能すぎる。俺。
5447 2018-12-04 16:15:19 Clive, the climate scientists have no responsibility for the Paris uprising. You have to blame the geologists for not finding enough cheap oil to go around, and now it's the responsibility of geologists to find other solutions. Phrased this way, it does sound absurd.
5448 2018-12-04 16:15:19 @BEPA_SA how do individuals join BEPA, I’m on the Oil & Gas sector
5449 2018-12-04 16:15:15 Can you highlight the part where he says “end oil and gas”? Because nothing in that screenshot says anything close to that.
5450 2018-12-04 16:15:12 This salad is really good!! 
Spinach, one green onion, half a tomato, an avocado, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, blueberries, salt and pepper! I’m surprised it’s so good!! 
5451 2018-12-04 16:15:11 Is possible that employees in the Oil/Gas industry disagree with their corporate political leanings and choose to donate to political candidates who want to regulate their industries?
5452 2018-12-04 16:15:03 We need to hear from @BetoORourke.  What IS his position on climate change?  To my knowledge, he hasn't passed any policies that benefit the oil & gas industry, and the urgency and anger over climate change hasn't reached a point where politicians know to turn down O&G donations.
5453 2018-12-04 16:15:00 You ever just want to brag on the Omega 3 oil you take??? I know it's crazy but its quality so I thought I'd throw that out there!
5454 2018-12-04 16:14:53 I guess taht what I read was right. Obrador is not willing to work with Pres Trump, who was formerly considering Venezuela as an exporter of oil to the US
5455 2018-12-04 16:14:48 *I announce I’m running for president in 2020*

TWITTER: “Tyler Simpson has never been involved in government but has somehow accepted $32 million from the oil industry.”
5456 2018-12-04 16:14:46 #AFNSCA2018 Alberta chiefs stand against a proposed bill that would diminish their royalties and access to markets with oil & gas
5457 2018-12-04 16:14:44 Lmfaoo I hate youu
5458 2018-12-04 16:14:36 i love this coffee and coconut oil lip scrub.  i wish i would rememeber more often.
5459 2018-12-04 16:14:27 Getting donations from INDIVIDUALS - even if it's the CEO - is far different than taking money from PACs and other corporate groups as Cruz and others have done. When you say "oil/gas industry campaign cash," you are being incredibly misleading.
5460 2018-12-04 16:14:20 I actually find responses like this as terrifying as all fossil fuels burning or full scale genetic engineering. At best, same category as the original industrialists who pioneered the #Anthropocene and all its failings. #EarthCrisis #coal #oil
5461 2018-12-04 16:14:17 Money that we Pay to Buy Oil.
Is the Money Used to Grow Islamism.
Is the Money used to Convert or Kill Infidels.
5462 2018-12-04 16:14:10 He also fails to reveal that oilmen in Texas contribute to essentially every candidate who is not against oil.
5463 2018-12-04 16:14:06 See, the LOC doesn't do anything for my hair so I don't do it... maybe you just need to switch it up, it could be products too. Like my hair is a little protein sensitive so if I use products with a lot of it my hair gets nasty lol. I can't do coconut oil either. Trial and error!
5464 2018-12-04 16:14:06 Why are we still paying subsidy on petroleum pump price even when we have 'change' govt in power? What has changed since inception of this administration in oil sector? Why can't we get our refineries work? #JH

Life should be primarily about enjoying yourself
5467 2018-12-04 16:13:49 If it makes you feel better, I’ve been given an avionics mech for the winter, who’s worked exclusively on airbus; to help me change wheels and brakes  takes the lad my full walk around, inside and flight deck checks to fill 2 engines with oil 
5468 2018-12-04 16:13:41 So is he or isn't he supposed to attend the G20? Also he said no such thing. But hey put your mo ey where your mouth is. Ask your wife if she would go to a oil corps camp alone?
5469 2018-12-04 16:13:34 Cutting oil production in Alberta and Jason Kennedy approves?!  @770CHQR He goes along with this, look-out. If elected he’ll propose a provincial sales tax. Just watch

5483 2018-12-04 16:12:30 EVs will start reducing demand growth as they are increasingly adopted, but it will take some time for the existing fleet to age out. So, I don’t expect a huge oil price impact from even 100% new car sales for a while. But, give it 10-years and watch out.
5484 2018-12-04 16:12:17 Groundnut oil or annoiting oil?
5485 2018-12-04 16:12:08 You haven’t seen the interview where she states no support for NG?

People change.

5487 2018-12-04 16:11:53 In ur first tweet, you said how you use it? A country with 85% of her resources from oil uses it to do more projects and you’re there comparing our own which’s not up to 30% to theirs? Besides our own is used to fund the free SHS thing
5488 2018-12-04 16:11:52 @tvcnewsng The Oil marketers should consider the commuters on the 7days ultimatum as this step might cause difficulties on the economy during the festive period #JH
5489 2018-12-04 16:11:47 I got my oil change finally
5490 2018-12-04 16:11:39 I could ask hows she attractive??? Lol I don’t even want to say because it’s ruuuuuuuude (I’ll DM if you want) and I’m not exactly an oil painting but nah never seen it at all beside having long hair that’s nice can’t think of nothing nice lol
5491 2018-12-04 16:11:35 Let us quit buying Saudi oil. Let us be independent from Saudi oil. Lets produce more of our oil and put the Saudis out of business.
5492 2018-12-04 16:11:35 And we’re taking about oil and gas, not guns. Typical deflection tactics. Either you are for oil and gas or you’re against. I suspect based on Betos record he’s not as opposed as he claims.

5500 2018-12-04 16:10:44 Since the FEC allows broad leeway in determining what your occupation is, I'm going to start making contributions to Bernie Sanders as "Fossil Fuel Consumer" and watch their heads explode when Bernie's OpenSecrets Reports starts reporting donations from the oil and gas industry.
5501 2018-12-04 16:10:40 #ukog - nothing to derampmor short here guys, this is a gusher.

5502 2018-12-04 16:10:34 I hate my car  I can’t do shit regular no more. No regular gas, No regular oil change , No regular antifreeze, No regular car wash; it’s just a big Non-regular expensive ass mess
5503 2018-12-04 16:10:28 of course they are doing worst, their economy is based on the oil price, very much so like Venezuela...the oil price goes down and down goes the economy...and if that question is answered by any Russian oligarchs, they would answer "completely false"...
5504 2018-12-04 16:10:21 No, they don’t. That’s just the factual rebuttal to the denialists’ pointing to a few oil industry hacks.

If a climatologist could factually dispute AGW, they’d get all kinds of recognition, prizes, and industry dollars.

At this point, even Exxon accepts AGW.

5508 2018-12-04 16:10:00 If you’d have watched the climate change townhall last night you’d see GOP-led governor (Georgetown TX) who made his town 100% renewable and he’s working w other cities to do same. It’s called LEADERSHIP. Perhaps Beto should get some skills in it. Oil and gas is killing us.

5510 2018-12-04 16:09:53 the figures appear to include contributions from oil and gas employees; it could be factory workers. So yeah, the figures are deceptive and shouldn't be used as he's using them.
5511 2018-12-04 16:09:51 Biru cuma mantul oil controlnya aja, ga bikin cerah muka. Itu si kalo di aku. Gak ada yang aneh-aneh efeknya
5512 2018-12-04 16:09:46 ...and the fact that oil & gas individuals, particularly those that can afford to donate at or near the individual max, know Beto isn't trying to run them out of business, which is why they are comfortable donating $2,000+ to his campaign, & why indiv. donor sources are relevant
5513 2018-12-04 16:09:42 Please read the article. Its point is that oil and gas drillers define "break even" differently than generally accepted accounting principles. 
In their lexicon, it doesn't include sunk capital. Doesn't mean revenue is high enough to operate without ongoing losses
5514 2018-12-04 16:09:39 Do I have to pick just one ?

5519 2018-12-04 16:09:24 Boss, oil money is what? Is it not generated from the reserves? And I’m saying that don’t compare those two countries when it comes to oil money. Saudi is a benchmark when it comes to the oil business
5520 2018-12-04 16:09:22 The oil bull case seems to be that Russia and OPEC can finesse supply? Is there anything more there?
5521 2018-12-04 16:09:19 Dear @cathmckenna  Help Alberta become a Clean Energy Industry Leader with global markets.  don't waste another penny on oil pipelines that just hasten the planets demise.  Align Canada with like minded nations to save this planet.

5527 2018-12-04 16:08:55 How will the federal government react to Alberta cutting oil production? I'm asking @gmacofglebe and @KatlynHarrison right now on @SXMCanadaTalks #cdnpoli #abpoli
5528 2018-12-04 16:08:27 見せろ
5529 2018-12-04 16:08:25 You were never looking for ckimate heros...you were always looking for money. You know oil reduction is possible on various application. You will only be satisfied until a profit is made on every last drop. No science will penetrate that bank vault mind.
5530 2018-12-04 16:08:24 I'm not saying a single pol being elected is going to put the oil & gas industry out of business. I'm saying that's the position all of our pols should take, that we're going to run oil & gas companies out of business. Maybe not today, or tomorrow, but in 5-10 years, absolutely.
5531 2018-12-04 16:08:16 When it comes to hydro power, their government takes the initiative to supply it because clean energy is valued by their voters. Instead, our citizens value destroying/depleting natural resources with tax cuts for oil companies & cutting gov expenditure for common sense energy
5532 2018-12-04 16:08:16 From individual folks who labeled their profession as oil/gas, you genius. Not PAC money!
5533 2018-12-04 16:08:14 Nope, you're the idiot thanking the Saudis
" ... for manipulating the price then think we are idiots and will thank  them for agreeing to release some more oil. We need a leader who knows  how to deal with OPEC."
File under, you can't fix Stupid

5535 2018-12-04 16:08:08 So you’re saying there are Texans working in the oil and gas industries? Unpossible!
5536 2018-12-04 16:08:01 Instead of bloating the government on borrowed money, she could have invested in building refineries next to the oil sands.. that would have been the best choice in alberta history. She has killed our province as fast as possible, worked with Trudeau to do it.
5537 2018-12-04 16:07:58 Lmaooo Fr tho with his Uncertified blue tick dried up oil having ass 
5538 2018-12-04 16:07:45 Me too. It made me feel like some things are worth the pursuit - like fame and good olive oil
5539 2018-12-04 16:07:42 When he dies, we can use him to augment our oil supplies.  Such a freaking slime!
5540 2018-12-04 16:07:40 Ford signalling he’s still campaigning. Next cartoon ideal the Saudi prince and oil prices? Cheers

5542 2018-12-04 16:07:39 Our bad @gotjane! Coconut is biologically a fruit but yes, classified as a nut per FDA. We suggest using your favorite alternate - since this recipe uses melted coconut oil, you might try a cooking oil like canola, vegetable, or grapeseed.
5543 2018-12-04 16:07:38 The oil industry, IMO, won't go away until a substitue can be found.  So many products are oil based that oil will probably be needed for a very long time.

5547 2018-12-04 16:07:24 Well done. @markiplier and @pewdiepie  for giving oil to racist attacks on Indians. Go to any live chats or pewdiepie vs @TSeries and see how are people reacting to Indians. Congrats you are now spreading racism worldwide..

5552 2018-12-04 16:07:01 She said how they are using their oil money. She never mentioned anything about reserves.

5554 2018-12-04 16:06:53 Yes, and most of his constituents aren't oil people but citizens who will be damaged by offshore drilling, and he screwed them over. That's how representative government is supposed to work, And you're a centrist Hillaryite with shit values--a Hillary bro
5555 2018-12-04 16:06:52 Are we losing opportunities in renewable?

Do you think closing down the oil sands is going to stop global warming?

5558 2018-12-04 16:06:42 They wouldn't donate or vote Beto if they thought he was going to put the oil & gas industry out of business, which is what we should be asking our politicians to do.
5559 2018-12-04 16:06:39 Interesting that construction bucks the trend - lower employment but higher wage. Understand lower emp. given AB oil sands construction down, but not sure on higher wage? Those AB boys are paid a hefty chunk of change higher than avg... Know what is contributing to the increase?
5560 2018-12-04 16:06:38 Difficult choices are going to have to be made re fossil fuels ( Oil and Gas). Certainly the burning of it. The English Parliament won't make that decision as they depend upon the income.Can an Indy Scotland do better ? I think we can.
5561 2018-12-04 16:06:38 흠... 10분만에 다깼다고...?
5562 2018-12-04 16:06:35 Aku pakai yang lotion gitu sih bukan cream

Benton atau cosrx lotion yang oil free?
5563 2018-12-04 16:06:28 I just received my paycheck from Roger Federer. He's paying me to love him. Yes, it's true. Waiting for my Spanish olive oil from Rafa, will use it for the Barilla products that came with the paycheck. 
5564 2018-12-04 16:06:23 LOL!!! I hate to break it to you....I don't think that orange smell is going to happen. I honestly think you'd be better off buying some Orange Essential Oil from Amazon and adding that! Instant results 
5565 2018-12-04 16:06:17 That's not the point. Jesus, you people are thick sometimes. Water has a 100% correlation with economic development, electricity somewhere near that, oil (petrol) also significant. Mess with those, you mess with the basics. Capiche?
5566 2018-12-04 16:06:12 Exactly the point...they're donating and voting for Beto because they know Beto is not going to harm the industry...this is mostly true for the people at the top, and Beto received plenty of large individual contributions from the oil & gas industry...
5567 2018-12-04 16:06:10 I washed all the locking gel and wax out my hair. Then got it retwisted with oil, Shea butter and honey
5568 2018-12-04 16:06:05 I’m baffled that Frank thinks Beto, or anyone else, becoming a Senator = oil & gas companies going out of business. How would that work, Frank? If Beto was elected, people would stop driving cars?
5569 2018-12-04 16:05:58 Now let's see.  We are going to export our oil from Alberta of which we have to much of and we are going to import our oil for the East.  What's wrong with this picture????????????????????????
5570 2018-12-04 16:05:52 not only that, think: continued oil subsidies. think: lost opportunities in renewables. think: coastal communities impacted by climate change. think: worsening global warming disasters
5571 2018-12-04 16:05:49 Beto didn’t take PAC or corporate money. look deeper into the “big oil” $$ that Beto allegedly took. It was from oil and industry employees. When you give a contribution, they ask who you work for. Also while your looking, see how much Bernie takes from the NRA.
5572 2018-12-04 16:05:46 I have an oil change appointment at 1pm but I just wanna stay inside and play my fanservice weeb dancing rhythm game reeeeeee

5576 2018-12-04 16:05:20 Okay So are you saying Sirota is lying about Beto being the second largest recipient of Oil and Gad money? Or are you saying it isn't a problem? Or are you saying it is true AND it is a problem but we should ignore it to beat Trump?

5582 2018-12-04 16:04:51 Oh I see what you’re saying now. I agree the left is overreacting to the Beto getting all that oil money.
5583 2018-12-04 16:04:50 The tweet under discussion compared both countries based on their oil reserves
5584 2018-12-04 16:04:50 @CapMetroATX not sure if your buses are ever supposed to do this or not but bus 2214 was blasting white-blue oil smoke for about 10 seconds on Manchaca.
5585 2018-12-04 16:04:13 I believe JT may well have some projection issues. This seems to be in fore front of his mind.   I think most Canadian oil workers are better than our current PM
5586 2018-12-04 16:04:04 That's their whole aim . To change our traditions .  They have more say here than in an Islamic country , crazily  Saudi , those oil hostage holders, wouldn't put up with their moaning.

5588 2018-12-04 16:03:44 ...it is hard to understand how people believe that a fuel engine can get to run for 200.000 miles and not a single oil change, those are the people who over look fake news...!
5589 2018-12-04 16:03:43 Helps get smooth and oil free skin: Beat one egg-white until stiff w/ lemon juice. Apply on your skin for 20 mins. Rinse w/ lukewarm water.
5590 2018-12-04 16:03:41 100% of all arguments on global warming alarmists side boil down to “money from oil industry”. In reality standing up to this dogmas a scientist is like walking down the street in SF with a MAGA hat.
5591 2018-12-04 16:03:41 Aint Nothin Slick To A Can Of Oil
5592 2018-12-04 16:03:40 Exactly. (AND the kitchen still smelling of hot oil for 24 hours after you’ve made latkes...)
5593 2018-12-04 16:03:32 Linking sanders to this and calling on him to repudiate it is an attack. There is no misinformation in this data, and the fact that a ton of fossil fuel peeps want Beto means they think he’ll protect their jobs, which is consistent with his policy agendas. Not anti Beto, anti oil
5594 2018-12-04 16:03:27 I wish we had a driveway so I could just change my oil myself
5595 2018-12-04 16:03:13 Will be interesting to see if Crude Oil can hold its recent lows if stocks come under pressure again.

Heating Oil and Gasoline seeing nice upside follow-through today, so we'll see if Crude can hold higher as well.
5596 2018-12-04 16:03:08 But I can't help but think she is Cute with those Bug Eyes and Olive Oil figure.......and then I remember she is in Congress.......
5597 2018-12-04 16:03:08 He did not "take oil money," he got donations from individuals. I'm from Oklahoma where almost 1/3 of employed work at O&G companies. Texas also large O&G state, so impossible to not get donations from people who have jobs in the industry. He took ZERO PAC $$$.
5598 2018-12-04 16:03:01 Run for oil Indian Oil
5599 2018-12-04 16:02:54 Haha I believe you! Against a heavy talented Stars team you need your best players to show up, I felt like the Oil lacked that last night and the Stars made them pay for it in the 3rd.
5600 2018-12-04 16:02:26 Exactly. Except morons who cheer for the damage to the oil industry are too stupid to look at the data showing worldwide demand is growing and will for several more decade.

5604 2018-12-04 16:01:44 You really are a fool. He gets his donations from individuals, in the state with the most oil and gas jobs in the nation. Of course a lot of them work in the industry. But they donate to him anyway instead of Cruz, because some things are more important than your employer.
5605 2018-12-04 16:01:32 I use spray bottle for when I’m not doing a full wash and I have leave in and argon oil but my hair ends up super dry everytime
5606 2018-12-04 16:01:26 Point me to the part where he says “end oil and gas now” because only a complete moron would make that kind of statement since 300 million Americans are reliant on it for heat, electricity and transportation.
5607 2018-12-04 16:01:25 They’ve no oil so I’m Pretty confident we won’t ‘rescue’ them like the Iraqis or Syrians.

5609 2018-12-04 16:01:22 RT @MikeHudema: WATCH: A cargo ship collides with a container vessel resulting in an oil spill 12 miles wide in the Mediterranean Sea.

Ima…
5610 2018-12-04 16:01:15 Not really. You buy a service plan that covers oil changes, maintenance, etc. They have alternatives for when they can't get you in in time, if you're out of town, live outside a town with a dealership, etc. You simply submit the receipt, they reimburse under the plan.
5611 2018-12-04 16:01:11 Because the doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers want to take care of people and they want everyone the have healthcare.

What about the oil executives?  What do they want?

So far people have refused to answer that.
5612 2018-12-04 16:01:07 We will kick Putin and MBS in the balls.  Then we will pursue clean energy and make the price of oil crater,
5613 2018-12-04 16:01:02 In my experience the “natural oil” wearers are much more egregious scent offenders than the perfume wearers.
5614 2018-12-04 16:01:00 One could replace the word oil with dairy and pipelines with consumers in this article and it would look as if you reversed your opinion on supply management... I do agree that production needs to be curtailed.
5615 2018-12-04 16:00:46 $0% of the oil imported to The U.S. Comes from Canada. Mostly from the province of Alberta (which sells virtually all it's oil to the U.S). A law has just been passed, to cut production in this province by 8.7%. This doesn't sound like much but It is a big step.

5617 2018-12-04 16:00:26 So if you work as a clerk at a gas & oil company then donate $20 to a candidate, you think that putting that donation down as a big money oil & gas donation is correct? 

That would mean Jane Public couldn't donate without you using it as a weapon.
5618 2018-12-04 16:00:20 They have been bought and paid for by the oil and coal lobbyists.

5620 2018-12-04 16:00:12 they want oil to get the bulk of your dollars, they don't want to be a world leader in electric cars like, china and india are.  oh well end of empire.  sad to see us fade.

I take CBD oil orally like a normal human so I don’t know how I managed to do this but like...my skin is soft as hell so maybe I uncovered a miracle.
5643 2018-12-04 15:58:39 Hahaha no one is seeing what your saying here it's not the point of going somewhere else it's the part of Toyota paying her for the oil change where there already paid through the service/warranty package
5644 2018-12-04 15:58:37 I thought I read about just using the whole cell (ie don't bother with the separation, just burn it all) in place of some awful, nasty stuff like fuel oil in cargo ships. If the material can get refined enough for consumer use like diesel from a pump, that'd be huge.
5645 2018-12-04 15:58:37 The latter, because if they can't/won't sniff out this snake oil, then ye gods what use are they?

5654 2018-12-04 15:58:02 Since energy policy including Oil is reserved to Westminster perhaps you should address your comment to PM May. ScotGov seeks to influence the debate on climate change where it can given it's very limited powers in this area.
5655 2018-12-04 15:57:59 Who’s been wanting to try my CBD OIL, but hasn’t ordered yet? What’s holding you back? It’s less than a cup of coffee per day! 
5656 2018-12-04 15:57:54 Whatever you do.... don’t take a peppermint oil bath without a carrier oil.. bout gave myself third degree burns 
5657 2018-12-04 15:57:52 I got oil every where 
5658 2018-12-04 15:57:51 And some of them contribute to political campaigns to people like Beto and Ted Cruz. I’m in Michigan where there are a lot less oil companies here and when there’s less oil & gas company employees there’s less being contributed to our senators campaigns. That was my point.
5659 2018-12-04 15:57:51 Pouring olive oil over them?
5660 2018-12-04 15:57:48 Oil is great for chemistry,so much stuff we can do with it. In the Netherlands we could all have been driving on gas if our government had promoted it. But all our government did was to put very high tax on LPG/natural gas propelled cars.
5661 2018-12-04 15:57:47 Every time I bring my car to the dealership for an oil change I want a new car I can’t wait to trade my shit in

5665 2018-12-04 15:57:24 Muscle relaxers, such as Baclofen, work great. I also use CBD oil to top it off. I know most people don’t like yoga, but staying in child’s pose for 2 to 3 minutes really stretches the muscles in the lower back and relieves tension!
5666 2018-12-04 15:57:24 Why don't you put a tariff on imported oil?  Think of all the money the US would make, TariffMan.
5667 2018-12-04 15:57:16 Saudi Arabia is indeed 80% oil based exports, in fact they're the ones who flooded the market with oil, drastically reducing it's price, however their machinery is far more efficient than what Venezuela have, so the oil can be extracted at a better profit. Look at oil prices.
5668 2018-12-04 15:57:14 Perhaps a bit too much tongue oil for a lunch time.
5669 2018-12-04 15:57:14 I dont like George Bush, but i will see he very quickly animated a nation to declare war to steal oil. I do feel Mr Trump is really ineffective in honoring his obligations nor has plans to
5670 2018-12-04 15:57:00 Kind of like an Oil Man but with worse morals?
I heard this in Daniel Plainview's voice but you just don't have his integrity
5671 2018-12-04 15:56:55 Putin wanted Arctic oil and Trump wanted Putin's money and support, so they conspired to steal the election. 

If that doesn't sink him, nothing will.
5672 2018-12-04 15:56:44 Does anyone know (vets DVM),if cbd oil can be used on dogs to modify barking and agression? #CBD
5673 2018-12-04 15:56:43 Junto a la crisis financiera, la distorsión del mercado petroleo llevó el precio a +100$/B. Lejos de intervenir para moderar el precio, la OPEP decidió no reaccionar permitiendo el acelerado desarrollo del Shell Oil y el Shell gas,q cambiaron radicalmente los factores del mercado
5674 2018-12-04 15:56:41 I’d love to know what critiques you’re referring to that we’re not funded by oil companies and the like. Those are really the only detractors. Either way placing this is the hands of the market is, at best, negligence akin to sleeping at the wheel
5675 2018-12-04 15:56:37 Why not advertise for cocain, heroin and opium? They yield even higher than mere marijuana.

Money is not everything my dear. Use your effort to concentrate on stabilising our oil sector. Use it also to talk about patching all leakages.
#NoToMarijuana
5676 2018-12-04 15:56:32 Ok... Now I see the issue. I guess you need to evaluate the risk of not having the oil changed in a timely fashion versus the engine seizing up. That said, I've gone a good number of miles over my timeline without any problems
5677 2018-12-04 15:56:30 It was just a 16 question quiz we made on oil and gas.
5678 2018-12-04 15:56:27 Lol this shit happens in Kaduna on a daily
5679 2018-12-04 15:56:19 There’s also a HUGE difference b/w Hillary criticizing top oil execs/boards from working around the law by maxing out individual contributions & Sirota presenting a total of contributions made by ALL oil/gas workers in a state where so many people work in the industry.
5680 2018-12-04 15:56:17 Clove oil to the rescue
5681 2018-12-04 15:56:12 Temperature and dryness effect amino acids and sugars, according to Maillard, releasing different flavors. I think the coconut oil would be comparable to butter  BUT remember THC evaporates Above 380 F. You can get coconut oil hotter than butter, which will burn
5682 2018-12-04 15:56:12 We need oil& gas  we need ti get it nuce & save so is california ocean
5683 2018-12-04 15:56:09 Bigdaddy got that hot oil waiting!!! Hahahahahahaha Zack da great
5684 2018-12-04 15:56:08 My oil already halfway through  either ima from or these oils burn quick!!!!
5685 2018-12-04 15:56:07 I'm really pissed. The building committee have been fighting for months like children and last week they disbanded the committee. Now we have no one to fill the motor oil because there's no committee to pay. Can these adults stop squabbling like children I need electricity ffs.
5686 2018-12-04 15:56:07 Sama kaya olive oil tinggal di spray diratain ke badan deh

5690 2018-12-04 15:55:39 No, but we see it for what it is-systematic dismantling of candidates using ideological purity tests that misrepresent, in this case personal donations from Texans who work in the oil/gas industry, in which there are many, because Texas is a dominant employer (39%).
5691 2018-12-04 15:55:28 Dishonest reporting. 

That money is from individuals - not corporations. A LOT of people work for oil and gas in Texas! They can use their paychecks to support whoever they want! 

You’re article is totally misleading, sir.
5692 2018-12-04 15:55:22 Eh iya itu body oil Natural Source gunanya untuk apa? Pakenya gimana?
5693 2018-12-04 15:55:18 So are you saying corporations haven't been causing a negative impact on our country and our working class? That the oil industry isn't helping cause climate issues?
5694 2018-12-04 15:54:49 If only @oreo have up on using illegally harvested palm oil.

5698 2018-12-04 15:54:30 And maintaining an r8 isn’t exactly cheap. Changing the oil is like 300 dollars lmao.
5699 2018-12-04 15:54:28 They **were** from individual people -- for a statewide race in the state with the most oil & gas workers in the country.
5700 2018-12-04 15:54:24 Shoutout to my dad for paying for my oil change
5701 2018-12-04 15:54:22 Just fried some plantains in my air fryer with a little bit of coconut oil... and uhm. I think I mighta just done something
5702 2018-12-04 15:54:18 Beto literally voted/supported oil/gas 2 biggest wins over the last 8 years (fracking boom/oil exports). My issue with Beto is he tries to play both sides. I want to fix climate change, then next let’s destroy the world with fracking boom & exporting our oil for higher prices
5703 2018-12-04 15:54:15 Notley has been a strident anti oil anti pipeline activist. Her record is clear. Now, before the election with her party rock bottom, she becomes suddenly a spokes person for the oil industry??? A skunk can't change its stripes. Anyway, too little too late, too much bad judgement

5708 2018-12-04 15:54:01 Oil down and dollar up means recession ahead. Very simple. Interest rates rising at wrong time and trade war caused all this @CNBC @realDonaldTrump
5709 2018-12-04 15:54:00 There is zero logic to the oil and gas companies supporting him as they do Republicans. Zero. So these are donations from individuals who see something they like in Beto.

5712 2018-12-04 15:53:46 Doesn't that imply that shale production is as much or more in control of oil prices than the Saudi's?
5713 2018-12-04 15:53:46 had a wood burning stove, an out house, a well with a pump in the front yard and no electricity or running water. I would have been dead if I had to grow up during his time. Grandma and him knew how to do everything. I don’t even change my own oil.

5715 2018-12-04 15:53:39 I'm perplexed by Ocasio-Cortez's comment. After all, Tesla is already "choosing to be courageous," like she advocates. My guess is that she has been influenced by smears from OIL'igarchs and shorts, and simply hasn't researched sufficiently. @evmom111
5716 2018-12-04 15:53:14 US crush still running hot. Oct crush 182.96 mb vs historical average of 152.90 mb. Soy oil stocks at 2.04 b pounds vs 1.99 last month, 1.6 last year.
5717 2018-12-04 15:53:11 Employer only needs to be reported for contributions totalling >$100. I love Beto, but let's acknowledge there are big $ donations in there. (As you would expect -- oil and gas co. ppl probably wanted to hedge their bets, Senator-wise.)
5718 2018-12-04 15:53:10 And on top of that, from @davidsirota : Beto voted to help the GOP and oil/gas lobbyists kill Democratic legislation to restrict offshore drilling. He cast this vote at a time scientists say we must reduce oil/gas development in order to fight climate change.
5719 2018-12-04 15:53:07 Body scrubs twice a week and I use baby oil as body cream
5720 2018-12-04 15:53:00 I thought your Premier decided against cutting oil production. Hmmm . . .
5721 2018-12-04 15:52:59 Personally I don't believe it can be treated. Give them all jobs in places there are no children, oil rigs or remote research stations, and forget it. The precautionary principle applies: don't let these people near places where there may be children.
That includes Twitter.

5725 2018-12-04 15:52:35 Dear Santa, for Christmas this year I’d like pipelines built, and for us to stop buying oil from a regime that allows women basically no rights.
5726 2018-12-04 15:52:30 That's to REPUBLICANS.  Can you figure out what would motivate an oil and gas company to pressure employees to donate to Beto?  I sure can't.  Our cynicism about corporate greed is getting in the way oflogic.
5727 2018-12-04 15:52:22 I remember hearing alot during Operation Iraqi Freedom about how we're going to pay for it, and we got the same response about how once we get the oil fields back up and running, that'll pay for the war, which of course never happened. Cortez should learn from that about *cont*
5728 2018-12-04 15:51:59 weird for people to be outwardly phobic towards the person with a vat of hot oil...
5729 2018-12-04 15:51:58 My old man literally doesn’t believe in oil changes lol
5730 2018-12-04 15:51:50 Imagine thinking this is representative. This isn’t to say the individual company shouldn’t be held responsible for this particular accident, they should —but using this to demonize natural gas and oil altogether is stupid.
5731 2018-12-04 15:51:44 I hate it when #Nigerian Oil marketers start threatening the govt when it’s drawing near to #Christmas 7 day ultimatum given to @NGRPresident and #Government before shutdown. Beware but don’t panic @NGRSenate @HouseNGR @NNPCgroup

5737 2018-12-04 15:51:14 In 2014 the snake oil salesmen Salmond managed to gloss over most of the separation issues, apart from the currency one. Today, partly due to Brexit, people are now much more aware how difficult and damaging separation would be. Sturgeon knows this and is effectively stymied.

5742 2018-12-04 15:50:44 Wasn't  it u that wanted to go back into Iraq and steal the rest of their oil? No one has raided ur country, but ur country has raided many other countries.
5743 2018-12-04 15:50:44 Highest contributions from big oil in all of Congress, besides Ted Cruz. And everyone already hates Ted Cruz.

5745 2018-12-04 15:50:41 OIL...your view
5746 2018-12-04 15:50:35 Sorry, missed that part. So you get free oil changes?
5747 2018-12-04 15:50:31 So it's not only cars but also infrastructure (roads, highways, service stations) industries (asphalt, concrete), institutions (motels, drive-ins), and norms (patterns of courtship, residence, work, habits and leisure time) all supporting Big Oil.
5748 2018-12-04 15:50:28 I say good for him since oil/gas mostly gives money  to Republicans. If he’s getting his fair share that means less for them.
5749 2018-12-04 15:50:24 The explanation is Berners trying anything to tear down any Democrat who they worry might outshine their ancient totem.

He counts every individual's donation as if it came from their employer, and in Texas the oil/gas industry is a major employer.

5751 2018-12-04 15:50:23 Offshore energy production creates problems for deep sea corals. Oil & gas operations can release drilling muds & stir up sediments.

5754 2018-12-04 15:50:09 isn’t the reason gold certs work is that govts and banks hold the gold in reserve to backstop their financial operations. I don’t see how this works with oil
5755 2018-12-04 15:50:04 I think it should be the law for food companies to print on their packaging whether the product has palm oil in it. It’s absolutely ridiculous that so many animals die each day (including 25 orangutans daily) due to the production of palm oil.

5759 2018-12-04 15:49:58 OK. I see where you’re coming from. A politician who is indebted to the oil/gas industry is “nothing noteworthy.”
5760 2018-12-04 15:49:49 بس لازم تكون الفئه على الحق
5761 2018-12-04 15:49:47 If we really cared about reducing the CO2 intensity of world's primary energy, we should probably do this:
1. Accelerate natural gas production.
2. Accelerate nuclear power plant deployment.
3. Deploy very high efficiency coal power plants.
4. Leave oil alone.

5781 2018-12-04 15:48:23 Obama’s recent humble brags about improving the quality of life for bankers and oil execs exemplify the depth of the system’s rot all around, and how disconnected the discourse is—war criminals, mostly, on one side, enablers on the other.
5782 2018-12-04 15:48:10 Do you not know what a deflection is? We were discussing whether taking money from oil industry employees was "primarily a far-left" concern and he brings up the effectiveness of her campaign strategy instead. Ya'll are just a circle jerk of idiocy.

5785 2018-12-04 15:47:49 sana oil HAHAHAHAHAH
5786 2018-12-04 15:47:38 If it's just an oil change, go to Mr. Lube or wherever and save the receipt as proof it was done. If they say you can't get it done elsewhere, they're full of shit IMHO
5787 2018-12-04 15:47:37 Anything that has patroleum jelly in the ingredients will suck out your natural oil. That’s why you have to always use it. Best to just use olive oil.

5790 2018-12-04 15:47:29 By being in the EU if scots are not then westminster will delay for 40 years to get the oil.
If scot gov offered an indy for oil type deal westminster would take it.
Unionists would then know there is no union and for them there never was a union.
I have two questions for you Jim
5791 2018-12-04 15:47:21 A guy who raised a ton of small dollar donations got some from individuals employed in the oil and gas industry in Texas. Shocking.

5795 2018-12-04 15:47:06 Bella day= car wash and oil change
5796 2018-12-04 15:47:05 I remember him saying that Bush did it wrong in Iraq. If it had been him, he would have bombed the sh*t out of the place ,and stole all their oil.
5797 2018-12-04 15:47:04 Really?? A politician from an oil state gets donations from workers that work in the oil industry that classifies them as the oil industry? Poor take, you should have initially stated how many/much were/was from non executives.
5798 2018-12-04 15:47:02 The most absurd thing is that we are buying Saudi oil despite having our own. What kind of failed policy is that?
5799 2018-12-04 15:46:54 Saudi Arabia has oil that is processed into fuel. Follow the money, it's all he cares about.
5800 2018-12-04 15:46:52 มึงจะปิดเฟซ?
5801 2018-12-04 15:46:51 And in a state like Texas I would imagine there are a lot of oil and gas employees. Imagine that!
5802 2018-12-04 15:46:51 So again I ask ... will you support the Green New Deal & stop taking money from the oil industry? @LongBeachPost
5803 2018-12-04 15:46:49 That’s why I just order Jamaican black castor oil now 
5804 2018-12-04 15:46:44 I think that might be a load of bull.. You can get oil change anywhere you want..
5805 2018-12-04 15:46:41 Oooh I see what you saying about the jab jab...  well we barr go look oil for jouvert because
5806 2018-12-04 15:46:39 Damnnn yo said 4 hours for an oil change  not happening lmao
5807 2018-12-04 15:46:35 ... They’re worried more about market access & demography because that’s how Xi pays the relevant citizen (remember China is an oil importing dictatorship so they can’t just roll everyone with a armored corps).
5808 2018-12-04 15:46:30 Or maybe a nice creamy oil down with heavy pepper
5809 2018-12-04 15:46:25 There's more to this world than "war profiteering" and oil companies.  And "alienating voters" is the way to end up with no power to do anything about any of it.

5811 2018-12-04 15:46:20 Seriously?  What a surprise that Texas would have oil and gas money.  Beto took no money from Pacs.  This is an early attempt to start the hate.
5812 2018-12-04 15:46:15 Olive oil. Sip on it, especially if you have a nagging or dry cough.
5813 2018-12-04 15:46:15 That was the reason for the high five, control of oil supply sorted.

5816 2018-12-04 15:46:10 Aware of it and yet the entire planet continues to invest in oil and gas. Why? Because it's critical to the economy which is a requisite to the transition that needs to occur. Meanwhile you clearly aren't living an emissions free life. Why not?
5817 2018-12-04 15:46:09 อย่าทำอย่างนี้สิเพื่อนนนนนน
5818 2018-12-04 15:46:07 He takes no corporate/PAC money. He does get many donations from individuals that work in the oil and gas industry because it’s TEXAS.
5819 2018-12-04 15:46:04 aaaaawww you too kind. Slump is always the worst!! I hope you get enough rest and able the get back to your usual productiveness. Your hardworkingness is truly remarkable. You can do it, add oil!

5821 2018-12-04 15:45:55 Dear Santa,

Can you give me the "The bodyshop" Tea Tree oil full set for Christmas. 

Thanks in advance.
5822 2018-12-04 15:45:41 The "guilt" should be more about the abuse colonialists imposed upon invaded civilizations through exploitation of people and resources. Even now, oil and mining corporations making the average westerner mutual funds do not compensate for what they pillage all over the world...
5823 2018-12-04 15:45:37 You’re no better a Trump supporter when you cowardly support politicians who are indebted to the oil/gas industry. It’s a shameful and selfish position given the direct threat they pose to the planet and our children.
5824 2018-12-04 15:45:29 Just what we need another corporate shill posing as a progressive. Obama 2.0 sets us back another decade. We can’t afford to sell out to the oil companies and banks again. The future of humanity at stake Cant afford for the people to be lulled into another Obama like slumber.
5825 2018-12-04 15:45:19 Shout out to men who take baths with lavender epsom salt, a little olive oil, a scented candle and a historical non-fiction book about WWI.
5826 2018-12-04 15:45:10 “It’s misleading to say that Beto is a republicanlite bought and paid for by the oil industry. I am totally not a republican.”
5827 2018-12-04 15:45:04 This has nothing to do with Citizens United.  If Beto got a donation from a gas station attendant it counts as oil and gas money.  David’s headline is misleading without any context.
5828 2018-12-04 15:45:02 No,no, no! Such 'research' isn't worth the paper on which it's written. We have plenty of proper, peer reviewed science we can share with you, but I'm afraid anything to the contrary is nothing more than industry snake oil. What next? Healthy tobacco? Good transmissible diseases?
5829 2018-12-04 15:44:41 Jeff Rubin on #BNN suggests cdn oil sands can't compete with US shale. That building a refinery is best option for AB. And that the Montney is Western Canada's real crown jewel.

But isn't US shale already gassing out & less economical vs. longevity of oil sands production?

5836 2018-12-04 15:44:25 The top exec of one of the big oil firms maxed out a donation to Beto...
5837 2018-12-04 15:44:22 Right so oil cleanser at night.. followed by a moisturiser or is it ok by its self
5838 2018-12-04 15:44:09 Qatar leaves OPEC. would make it official next month. They said they're focusing on gas instead of crude oil. But it's most likely as a result of issues with some Arabian States. #Godhelpsavetheworld
5839 2018-12-04 15:43:38 But this whole dust up began with Sirota claiming Beto was unacceptable for taking money from oil and gas employees. If that’s bad, so is taking money from agribusiness.
5840 2018-12-04 15:43:03 @Ocasio2018 you uneducated dumbass, you need clearly don’t get that oil subsidies far outweigh the subsidy for @Tesla 

You make me want to move to NY & run to get your stupidity out of Congress. No place for this level of ignorance. #OcasioCortez #uneducated #CleanEnergy
5841 2018-12-04 15:43:02 Cameron, your study is based on data from /06. During the past 12 yrs the demand for palm oil has significantly. New evidence shows that deforestation to make way for oil palms is the cause of the decline in the orangutan population. I urge you to visit @GreenpeaceUK & @Mongabay
5842 2018-12-04 15:42:50 I propose we walk everywhere for the rest of our lives. That'll show those evil oil companies

5847 2018-12-04 15:42:25 Do you think westminster would accpet the will of the scots and not try to keep our oil and gas  by whatever means they can?
Do you really expect fair play from them?
5848 2018-12-04 15:42:21 Better have some oil

5852 2018-12-04 15:42:07 I don’t understand why Republicans are against a clean, sustainable earth. I know, they want coal and oil to fill their greedy pockets. But they can do that with renewable energy sources too. Invest in the future, you and your future family live here too. Mind boggling

5857 2018-12-04 15:41:59 “Also, these are small dollar donations from employees who work in the oil/gas industry.”

If this is actually true, then #BetoOBama supports a #GreenNewDeal, right?

If he doesn’t, then we know why, and also know this is bullshit.
5858 2018-12-04 15:41:57 @martinplaut @DekiSawa The act of throwing oil/powder/eggs stuff on a political commentator, in this case, Martin Plaut, is #TERRORISM. And those supporting the wicked act are perpetrators.
5859 2018-12-04 15:41:54 My wife as a Toyota RAV4 , when got the vehicle they gave her 4 oil changes at no charge, she had less than 11,000kms on the vehicle when she got the 4th oil change.
5860 2018-12-04 15:41:52 No need to pay for oil in dollars is it ?
5861 2018-12-04 15:41:44 Get it right, Dude. Not from the oil companies. From the employees. Come on. #resist
5862 2018-12-04 15:41:35 It is sadly ironic that the smaller headline reads "Shell to start new NOrth Sea oil drilling project in Penguins field" when the North Sea is almost depleted. Why, Ben?!!
5863 2018-12-04 15:41:28 Westminster went to illegal war for oil Jim.
Do you really think they will let scots walk away with thiers?
They have already threatened scots trade,,,if scots are in the beter union then they have to trade on EU rules and cant take scots resources.
sad scots need protecting.
5864 2018-12-04 15:41:25 The hate mongering sexual predator George Takei just can't stop with the BS. Why is it you can't seem to live your life the way you righteously expect others to live? The power of love, acceptance and blah blah blah... You're a snake oil salesman.
5865 2018-12-04 15:41:25 He shouldn't run in his home state?

There's no doubt workers from all sorts of industries donated to Bernie's campaign.

The oil/gas sector wasn't even close to the largest sector in terms of individual donations to Beto's 2018 campaign.
5866 2018-12-04 15:41:16 I was never in favor of people associate with oil being in government and I felt a lot of his policies were trash. A lot of the garbage politicians we have now are a result of both Bush administrations' grooming.
5867 2018-12-04 15:41:14 Mmmmmm I smell like oil and onion
5868 2018-12-04 15:41:12 Oil and gas industry employees see where their industries are headed... they live that angst and anxiety every day... the more agile ones are jumping into the renewables energy industries as fast as they can. #Texas One of my minimuffins is there already #Solar #Houston
5869 2018-12-04 15:41:07 So...
Will there be any impact on oil prices.
5870 2018-12-04 15:41:03 Before today, I thought George H. W. Bush hadn't done anything for us but drag us into a never ending oil grubbing war. However, today his death got me out of my last lab and the quiz, thanks dude.

5873 2018-12-04 15:40:48  My idea was to give England a vote on Scottish independence.
 we would of course give Edinburgh, the highlands, Aberdeenshire, and the Scottish islands (Oil has nothing to do with this list ) the option to stay in the UK.

They're just as ecologically important as shallow water corals, & as vulnerable to human activities like fishing & oil production.They grow without light so feed on organic material falling /from currents

5890 2018-12-04 15:39:35 Hi Steve. We Greenpeace's concerns and are committed to eradicating deforestation in the palm oil supply. We’re actively working with suppliers to ensure palm oil is fully traceable & believe we can have greater influence on compelling them to act if they remain a supplier.
5891 2018-12-04 15:39:27 So you see how pained you are because someone told you the simple truth, you can't say something idiotic and claim it's on your timeline and he said you're supposedly a doctor ,which much sense is expected but you fumbled.
Ordinary criticism you can't handle but u drag the CinC.
5892 2018-12-04 15:39:23 So are most of these donors from corporate execs, superPacs (which Beto pledged not to take), or individual employees? Did you research that far into the list? Because those specifics make a big difference in how you characterize Beto as being in the pocket of big oil or not!
5893 2018-12-04 15:39:22 You'll rub oil on ur ugly face and be shouting sun kissed 
5894 2018-12-04 15:39:22 No it won't.
It puts us in direct competition with Ireland and N.Ireland.
Our oil wealth, fishing and other resources will be gobbled up by Westminster as they set up trade deals.
Our powers fiercely won will be meekly taken.
There is no good BREXIT for Scotland.

5916 2018-12-04 15:38:05 The capitalist billionaire siphon off the world's oil into their tankers, while millions have to burn manure for heat.
5917 2018-12-04 15:38:02 ถ้าคอนแซ่บขนาดนี้ 
คัดหวังคัมแบคแล้วอะ
หวีดรอเลยได้ปะ
5918 2018-12-04 15:38:01 you are? calling it oil money like its something bad lool.
5919 2018-12-04 15:37:54 Nalimutan ko gumamit ng oil film bago mag defense, ayan tuloy ginamit yun pang gisa samin
5920 2018-12-04 15:37:50 Glow with Oil... 
5921 2018-12-04 15:37:50 Destroying our public lands for petroleum enriches the oil companies, creates very few jobs, and ramps up the damage to our health and environment

Save our parks for public enjoyment and natural buffer. Turning our efforts toward emission-free energy will create more, good #jobs
5922 2018-12-04 15:37:43 Finally, people are sick and tired of their snake oil. Those 2 need to slink back to their mansion and live in seclusion so that the rest of the country and the world can forget they ever existed. Won't happen, but I can dream.
5923 2018-12-04 15:37:35 อุ้ยขอ มั้ง555
5924 2018-12-04 15:37:35 Because a $2700 contribution from an employee of an oil manufacturing company is what's REALLY wrong with our country.
5925 2018-12-04 15:37:32 I filled car with CBD oil and now it's a HIGH-brid. Please unfollow me.
5926 2018-12-04 15:37:31 Nobody that cares about climate change gives a flying fuck whether he took the money from oil companies or oil company executives. It makes no difference whatsoever. And BTW, Beto took tons of Wall Street money too. He's a fake progressive and won't get any progressive votes.
5927 2018-12-04 15:37:30 Chi oil smells sooooo good
5928 2018-12-04 15:37:29 Things I’ve learned this morning so far: sesame seed oil looks a lot like agave sweetener and doesn’t taste that good in oatmeal
5929 2018-12-04 15:37:24 面白すぎる
5930 2018-12-04 15:37:19 These are oil and gas EMPLOYEES.  You know the people who work in the fields and type memos, work in HR,  and cap oil wells etc The fact that you think employees are not allowed to give Beto 25 or 250 dollars is weird.
5931 2018-12-04 15:37:17 He fashioned himself as an Obama (also pro oil), we wanted him to be Bernie.
5932 2018-12-04 15:37:15 Beto’s from TX, so of course many of the individual donors will work in oil and gas. Accepting $ from an oil/gas companies/lobbyists is different. @davidsirota is being foolish at best and deliberately misleading at worst. He
5933 2018-12-04 15:37:07 My friend just got back from Ori Oke with anointing Oil complaining he's hungry that he wants to eat Jollof rice.
Now he's not talking to me cause i use the Vegetable oil in his bag to cook Jollof rice.
Please have I done anything wrong
5934 2018-12-04 15:36:59 So far using an iron on a super low setting over cloth with vegetable oil is working best. If my hands don't fall off, it'll he a miracle. It's makes it so satisfying when it peels off though
5935 2018-12-04 15:36:44 Also we should screen over the smaller house mounted turbines so birds can't get killed
When people talk about birds being killed in turbines,  remind them it will be easier to overcome that problem than when we have oil spills kill thousands of birds in a long painful death
5936 2018-12-04 15:36:43 @Westernsoldier They used the military for what they had in store & all those Oil $$$  weren't making them any profit
5937 2018-12-04 15:36:43 Watch the video. Hillary attacked Obama for taking individual contributions from oil and gas employees.
5938 2018-12-04 15:36:30 Oil stupid
5939 2018-12-04 15:36:28 is there something wrong with oil? money is money or are you one of those racists just because it isnt western money?
5940 2018-12-04 15:36:25 Apa beza cleansing oil dgn cleansing lotion? Thanks in advanceeee
5941 2018-12-04 15:36:18 Jergen aku pake yg Healthy Care, itu yg paling lembab diantara varian lain, menurutku yaa, hehe.
Etapi emang aku sih masih campurin olive oil sih biar lebih lembab.
Aku juga doyan banget pake lotion, seluruh tubuh pake gada yg lewat.
5942 2018-12-04 15:36:10 Let me confuse some of y'all females 

Oil change
5943 2018-12-04 15:36:10 Tell me please, how do you clean up hundreds, thousands of turbines once they've met their best before date. The steel, concrete, oil, generators ect. where does it all go, how is it recycled? Are they left to rot in the field?
5944 2018-12-04 15:36:08 I love how in the news there’s a dire story on climate change then the next story is about oil or gas and how someone is vying for contracts
5945 2018-12-04 15:36:02 You are definitely an oil man but you certainly aren’t a journalist, you are a waffling gossip.
5946 2018-12-04 15:36:02 If we’re talking about well developed Muslim countries, countries like UAE, Qatar and Kuwait are very modern and well developed in certain areas to a much higher standard than most nations, Islam is certainly not a barrier to development, obviously the oil money helps as well.
5947 2018-12-04 15:35:49 If One Finger Brought Oil - Things Fall Apart part Biafra24
5948 2018-12-04 15:35:47 What's the argument for not constantly managing the oil supply out of Alberta? I think that's the bust in your analogy.
5949 2018-12-04 15:35:45 bread brushed with oil outside and beaten egg in the well inside = A wonderful fried bread scrambled egg sandwich!
5950 2018-12-04 15:35:45 2/3 #TeamEA placed an oil absorbent boom across the watercourse to reduce the impact on the environment and protect the water quality. We believe at this stage the heavy rain during the night may have flushed out the pollution from the drain
5951 2018-12-04 15:35:44 The markets and American oil did it for them.
5952 2018-12-04 15:35:41 I believe Beto adequately protected against undue influence by relying only on indiv donations w/ a $2700 cap. His fundraising appeared to be large & diverse. As to his platform, he didn't claim to be progressive. Working ppl work for oil in TX. Those are his constituents too.
5953 2018-12-04 15:35:23 It's a twofer! Punish GM for making Trump look bad, AND strengthen US dependance on oil benefitting big oil.
5954 2018-12-04 15:35:18 Wow... I’m going to have to try that!! Because I’m so oily it’s ridiculous lol it’s interesting to use oil to get rid of oil .
5955 2018-12-04 15:35:09 I did oil pulling once last summer!, I felt so gross after I just ended up brushing my teeth anyways
5956 2018-12-04 15:35:07 ↓いつも通りドル円の話

Zzz...
5957 2018-12-04 15:34:46 Oil will be used and around forever. Electric cars are powered by....batteries. How are they made? With what electrical equipment? Keyboards, computers, machinery..oil. 

Only extremely naive people believe oil can be eradicated from use. Not in our lifetimes or even close.
5958 2018-12-04 15:34:45 There you are the right one. Our country has always taken
Yes, also in the Middle East the oil.
If it did not come by itself, then we took it, we waged a small war.
We are to blame for the conflict in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The main thing is that our profit is great.
5959 2018-12-04 15:34:43 ...but @neeratanden is a Clinton person, and it doesn't appear she has any issue with that Clinton campaign ad talking about Obama's individual oil & gas donors, but she suddenly has a major problem talking about individual oil & gas donors to Beto?
5960 2018-12-04 15:34:39 My PhD research was on understanding the mechanism of RubisCO and it's role in carbon metabolism. I'd wanted to work in biofuels, but cheap oil killed most of the biofuel research around the time I graduated, and an academic postdoc seemed unbearable. Such a cool field tho
5961 2018-12-04 15:34:33 Only thing more toxic than the $200+ billion tar ponds is the shit spewing out of snowflake albertans deflecting from their own greed & short-sightedness. Oil is over. Be part of the solution. We need to move forward, together
5962 2018-12-04 15:34:31 "But of course Beto took money from oil/gas employees and executives, he's from Texas!" 

Maybe we don't elect anymore presidents from god damn Texas because THEY ARE ALL PETROLEUM STOOGES
5963 2018-12-04 15:34:21 Me n you like water and oil, tried to keep it fresh just to watch it spoil
5964 2018-12-04 15:34:09 เหมือนเวลาเข้าเวรอะ ฮ่าๆ
5965 2018-12-04 15:33:59 Several weeks after cessation of progesterone shots and still have severe, round the clock itching from the oil.  When does this end?? #ivf
5966 2018-12-04 15:33:59 Also he represents El Paso/West Texas. That's where the oil is.
5967 2018-12-04 15:33:59 How did i just say i wish i had dome chilli oil. Who even am I anymore. We even do have chilli oil and i will be putting it on my pasta

5970 2018-12-04 15:33:37 US Secretary of the Navy, under Obama, Ray Mabus discussing his time in office. Was told 30% alternative energy in US Navy was achievable. He instead decided to aim for 50%. Navy has led in energy transformation. Sail to coal, coal to oil, oil to nuclear. #CAAFI2018
5971 2018-12-04 15:33:33 The Beto oil and gas donation stuff is weird because .... like ,.., his bad climate and energy politics  are right there out in the open you don’t even need to dig through the donation records to find them
5972 2018-12-04 15:33:33 There is way too many coincidences with this mans tweets and market movements and timing. Check out charts and the timing of his oil tweets of late. Bashes oil as it was turning around, Amazon, ect. It's so obvious!
5973 2018-12-04 15:33:29 Righty should never use a product or service from the 5th largest economy Cali in the world.  Go back to ur coal n oil leave all electronics for us
5974 2018-12-04 15:33:26 provide for those who grieve in Zion— to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, n a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair. They will be called oaks of righteousness, a planting of the Lord for the display of his splendor

5977 2018-12-04 15:33:08 Vilifying the Liberals is a provincial sport in Alberta. If the Liberals had done the proper consultations on TMX they would be accused of foot dragging and slowly killing Alberta's oil and gas industry. Oh wait, they didn't! Well, same conclusion by Don anyway. 
5978 2018-12-04 15:33:07 If it’s the same as here: coffee that you blend with an egg, coconut oil and butter
5979 2018-12-04 15:33:01 People Can't Get Around The City Without Oil. ! ?
5980 2018-12-04 15:33:00 Right after declaring support to auto industry workers, it is flippant to impress an actor when the country is already not going to have a balanced budget. You have oil & gas workers, farmers,vets struggling, we need sewage plants in BC and Quebec..on and on.
5981 2018-12-04 15:32:54 Jim WM has taken 92% of oil revenues for 50 years and still bankrupted the oil rich UK.
How can any scot still think there is or ever has been anything that could be described as a "union"?
5982 2018-12-04 15:32:53 Trouble with our economy is that the world thinks we are just another oil nation and we are a lot more than that
5983 2018-12-04 15:32:49 Rub me w oil or die. MOOD LMAO
5984 2018-12-04 15:32:44 Why would anyone put a tax or fee for alternative energy? We need to get off the oil. We have cleaner energy. Save the planet damnit.
5985 2018-12-04 15:32:40 McDonald’s used to cook their fries in beef tallow. Movie theaters used to make their popcorn in coconut oil. Fun Nazis had both of these things killed. Funny that is a thing now to cook food in coconut oil because it’s “healthier”.
5986 2018-12-04 15:32:35 Life lesson.....I tried mixing love into oil and water and I’m very sad to say, they just don’t mix. Make no mistake, I’ve given it my best.
5987 2018-12-04 15:32:29 Lol aa le so o
5988 2018-12-04 15:32:28 Wouldn't you leave too if the major Opec Arab producers Saudi and UAE were boycotting Qatar and trying to take advantage of illegal and extraterritorial  US sanctions limiting  Iranian oil sales. Could be new members however if oil price continues to fall - maybe Texas & Alberta.
5989 2018-12-04 15:32:26 On BNN this morning @JeffRubin is painting a very harsh reality for Canadian oil production and profitability.  "A pipeline does not solve the problem, no pipeline has come on stream making Canada uncompetitive, its US fracking that is making Canada uncompetitive."
5990 2018-12-04 15:32:25 I believe these are donations from *people* who *work* in the oil industry, not corporate money. And since it’s TX, that would serve to reason. Like if he was in WV you would expect him to get money from people who work in coal.

5997 2018-12-04 15:31:55 Lagos?
5998 2018-12-04 15:31:43 Makes me wonder about Saudi oil, vs Canadian oil and armored cars vs pipelines and the subsequent trade offs. Hmmmmmm.
5999 2018-12-04 15:31:43 Look up the # of Edmonton (capital city) train yard derailments, NOTLEY wants to use this federally regulated corridor to transport oil?  Does she even know how the country is governed?????
6000 2018-12-04 15:31:40 Not “Oil”. “Petroleum”. Hence ‘OPEC’.

6003 2018-12-04 15:31:24 Oilers and their orange and blue came directly from Gulf Oil company which was hopes to be a major sponsor of the team when it launched.
6004 2018-12-04 15:31:15 Royalties should go up immediately and subsidies eliminated.  The cost of the tar sands is already out of control and the oil and gas industry already has a plan to leave it to us to solve.

6008 2018-12-04 15:30:58 We’re at the oil changing place and they tell @therealJSparks to flash his high beams and he turns his windshield wipers & the wiper fluid too.

6010 2018-12-04 15:30:40 fossil fuels are deadly and destroying the planet. You know that stuff that comes out the tailpipe of gas powered autos? It’s not oxygen, it’s poison and the US government together with oil companies have screwed the American people because of greed.

6015 2018-12-04 15:30:13 Fracking and American ingenuity at it's best. Our president recently keeps trying to "talk" the price of oil down not realizing that for the first time in decades this might be against our best interest.

(Finally.)
6019 2018-12-04 15:29:51 Y’all must just know that the bacteria produces a product that degrades oil which is an ecofriendly solution to the oil spillages instead of using the chemical products currently available.
6020 2018-12-04 15:29:50 I’m NOT worried about an OPEC cut in oil production.
We have 30 million barrels of oil in the US - Canada system that we have NO place to put.
It’s deflationary.

#TradersEdge
6021 2018-12-04 15:29:48 Actually, it is completely unfair criticism.

Bro received $429K of $70 million (0.6%) from Oil/Gas EMPLOYEES and of that $429K, only $70K was from execs (0.1%), so you'll excuse me if I call bullshiz for the other 99.9% of us that donated.
6022 2018-12-04 15:29:43 The problem of France is deeper than the taxes of oil, it's the progresives like we have here that destroyed everything they touch, Pelosi, Schumer, Cortez, Sanders, Obama, Mueller, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, etc etc. 
France emigration and progressives are destroying everything there.
6023 2018-12-04 15:29:39 How soon will someone have a video up on YouTube with "tariff man" replacing "oil man" in the There Will Be Blood speech? I may be disappointed in the internet if it hasn't happened already
6024 2018-12-04 15:29:37 Coconut oil instead of waiting money on cleansing water imo
6025 2018-12-04 15:29:36 これは犬としての習性を隠しきれていない説がありますね
6026 2018-12-04 15:29:35 Getting my oil changed so that I can continue to treat my Jeep like a Tonka toy.
6027 2018-12-04 15:29:25 Again, I should mention that even though it is out of the ordinary, that does not necessarily imply that he is compromised or subject to oil & gas influence. It may be totally unrelated, but it's worth looking into IMO.
6028 2018-12-04 15:29:24 How many of those has 45 turned over to oil companies?
6029 2018-12-04 15:29:19 10% of Canada's oil production is unprofitable. Yet Canada spends billions upon billions subsidizing it.  We are the biggest hypocrites on the planet.  

*Fun fact: Only 10% of Canada's oil production is subject to the extreme light vs. heavy oil price differential. Yet "crisis".
6030 2018-12-04 15:29:08 Reading about Trudeau's supposed slight to oil patch workers this morning. It never fails to surprise me that Albertans have the thinnest skin of any province I've visited, especially since they trumpet their own strength so much of the time.
6031 2018-12-04 15:29:06 Time to rotate tires, oil change.
6032 2018-12-04 15:28:58 come on man, taking money from   *individual constituents* working for oil companies isn't "taking oil money" and it's bad faith distortion to paint it as such. by this standard, Ocasio took "finance money" which is a dishonest attack that has also been thrown around.
6033 2018-12-04 15:28:55 It took me a minute to realize that I have oily skin so I finally decided to try an oil free facial wash and moisturizer.
6034 2018-12-04 15:28:42 A false statement is only a lie when there is intent to deceive. There's no moral issue in being wrong if you've taken reasonable measures to be correct.

So unless you've been leaking oil or have noticed urges to plug yourself into outlets to recharge, you're good.
6035 2018-12-04 15:28:41 I got up went to get a oil change, went to the grocery store , made dinner for the night and back in bed before i have to go to work 
6036 2018-12-04 15:28:39 It is all done to suit the interests of the oil companies. Ever wondered if you are making Saudi Arabia richer and helping fund the bombing of Yemen? No reason you can’t have a progressive taxation related to volume sold. Rich could still avoid by small/often, but easy this way.
6037 2018-12-04 15:28:38 @JustinTrudeau Hey JT I know you're busy not finding the missing native women and approving oil sand ops (EW) but could you help a poor girl out and slide into Service Canadas dms, cause I'm dying out here and my dad alrady died, hence why I get his CPP
6038 2018-12-04 15:28:37 ohhh kalau cream malah tambah komedoan yah fi :( kalau misalnya yg water based gitu creamnya? atau udah coba facial oil? 
toner sebenernya gpp sih, aku aja pakai 2-3 toner xD (lebih suka toner drpd krim aku anaknya, tapi klo malem gak krim jadi kering bgt kulitku)
6039 2018-12-04 15:28:35 He is 12 basically... the same age coincidentally back in 1958 when a western TV show Trackdown aired an episode of a “snake oil salesman” that comes to town saying he can save the world by building a protective wall...

6043 2018-12-04 15:28:24 Oil resistance work boots from red wing size 10. Purchased these while working in Kentucky and never got the chance to take back and exchange. Boots do not come with box retail price: $220
6044 2018-12-04 15:28:19 โดนตบสถานเดียวอ่ะ
6045 2018-12-04 15:28:19 But can you experience the joy of wrenching on it forever? No. People don't buy an English sports car to actually drive it. It sits in the garage, leaking oil, so you have a reason to get out of the house, and disappear inside the guts of a car.
6046 2018-12-04 15:28:19 But when the oil companies raise cost by the exact amount nobody riots. Once again the ignorant should have been smacked down because at least this increase was to do more then line oil execs pockets
6047 2018-12-04 15:28:05 have talk about face oil for acne prone skin?
6048 2018-12-04 15:28:03 You think there is no demand for Canadian oil world wide? There is plenty of demand. Just no way to get it there to get actual world prices.
6049 2018-12-04 15:27:59 Only an idiot would setup shop based on a resource that had no guaranteed in which to get it to market.  I find it comical that “free market” folks, often conservative but not always, rail against other forms of welfare, sans when it comes to corporate or in this case, oil sands.
6050 2018-12-04 15:27:57 I'll give you that tweet was a bit hyperbolic, but it illustrates a point. And if you think one candidate taking oil and gas money while another hosts a town hall on climate change is a "slightly different perspective," I really don't know what to tell you.
6051 2018-12-04 15:27:56 あり！！
6052 2018-12-04 15:27:56 We fought this for 30 years and this prick immediately moved on this. Wrecking the wilderness for oil profit.  He needs to be removed for this, if not for all his other crimes against humanity and the planet.
6053 2018-12-04 15:27:53 Oil and gas, Stocks and Bonds though not very lucrative as they used to be.
6054 2018-12-04 15:27:52 How much money did it take the oil industry to get Trump to end these subsidies?
6055 2018-12-04 15:27:52 WCS crude discount widens a bit again following @RachelNotley's announcement of output cuts in Alberta. Now at US$23.50/bbl under WTI, according to @Ne2Group. #ableg #oil #oott

6058 2018-12-04 15:27:38 New article in @BenCanMag profiles the #FuelingWaterDisclosure investor campaign which is pushing water-intensive oil & gas companies to improve their water management at a time when fresh water is becoming more scarce globally @nadiranarine
6059 2018-12-04 15:27:36 The Dove is gentle on skin. 

The rooibos with glycerin will help prevent your skin from drying out. 

When we wash our our skin with harsh soaps it dries our skin, forcing it to produce more oil, acne cycle continues.

You've got great & gentle options there. Try Rooibos first.
6060 2018-12-04 15:27:34 おめ！！
6061 2018-12-04 15:27:28 What I assume it shows is that he lives in an area where lots of people/voters work in the oil and gas industry.
6062 2018-12-04 15:27:26 Oil hoping up!
6063 2018-12-04 15:27:25 So I guess I can’t bad mouth oil companies because one of them put me through college. 
6064 2018-12-04 15:27:18 Umm...accepting donations from individuals makes him beholden to corporations?  Huh, that’s a new one. The largest industry in TX is oil/gas. It stands to reason he’d receive donations from workers in that field. I’ve followed you for a while and this tweet is disappointing.
6065 2018-12-04 15:27:06 I was talking Fed #ndp and yes more specifically oil. However, we cannot go “cold turkey” as many unrealistic ideologically based people seem to believe. Change must and will happen, but we must effect it with a common sense approach. #ableg
6066 2018-12-04 15:27:01 Cool deflection, my guy. Either taking money from oil and gas industry employees is only a "far-left" concern or it's not. Hillary is a centrist and she thought it was a concern in regards to Obama. Just acknowledge it and move on.

Go birds.
6067 2018-12-04 15:26:59 UK's entry: botox and plastic surgery. Ireland's entry: fake tan, fake tattoos and baby oil. #eurovision
6068 2018-12-04 15:26:38 Bernie surrogates used this same tactic against Hillary. Said she accepted money from the oil industry when it was from the employees.
6069 2018-12-04 15:26:35 No, which is why oil and gas CEOs gave generously to Cruz.
6070 2018-12-04 15:26:34 Average donation $160. Wow.  Beto was a complete sell out!!  SMH. I’m sure he was going through every donation to kick back any affiliated with oil & gas in the whole state of TX. & what a surprise not that he received these donations while running for Senator.
6071 2018-12-04 15:26:27 Not defending what David did here, but to be fair Beto voted in favor of lifting the ban on exporting US crude and for off shore drilling. His environmental record otherwise one of the best. So I don't think he's in the tank for big oil but there is a something there.
6072 2018-12-04 15:26:19 Everybody has to work somewhere.  Where do you think voters are? Should he declare that he's not going to accept any money from people who work in oil and gas, even if they are office workers or in HR?
6073 2018-12-04 15:26:16 THIS. Exactly! To report in the form of a question with a suspicious tone isn’t journalism, it’s intended to slant and mislead. This is the problem. I’d still love to see how much ted rec’d from the oil & gas industry and compare the numbers...
6074 2018-12-04 15:26:13 $CL_F: WTI Crude oil futures tested R2 overnight, pulled back to pivot point 53 and rebounding from pivot point now. Appears headed back to R2 55.68, in between R1 is 54.76.

6077 2018-12-04 15:25:41 They have these games where you have to change oil and parts but that's not really funny, at all
6078 2018-12-04 15:25:41 I had on body oil too. I was probably out there being sautéed smh.
6079 2018-12-04 15:25:38 Arghhh in this dangerous season, people are scared ooo
6080 2018-12-04 15:25:35 Not to mention the ONLY reason the NDP are doing this is to push up pricing on oil to...increase tax revenue.  $4 per barrel = 1B in tax. #theydontcareaboutus #followthemoney

6084 2018-12-04 15:25:19 Did u mean minister for Tourism and not minister of petroleum since most of the time when we hear in speak it is usually when he attends an oil and gas seminar or event outside the country.he has abandoned his responsibility ( if he had any sef) to Baru since Baru is now the boss

6087 2018-12-04 15:25:11 He got donations from people in Texas. A lot people in Texas work in the oil and gas industry. It's not rocket surgery.
6088 2018-12-04 15:25:10 Keystone Pipeline, a disaster from the beginning. However, Environmentalists aren't in the front line fighting this stupidity of the oil barons, nope not one whit. Instead, it is the Native Americans who are at the forefront of this war to protect their Lands.
6089 2018-12-04 15:25:10 @nelsonbocaranda revisa el @FraserInstitute de Canadá, que publicó encuesta sobre inversiones en oil & gas. Venezuela es el país menos atractivo del mundo para invertir en el sector. no hay sorpresa
6090 2018-12-04 15:25:09 We are to trust the words of a failing charlatan like yourself? Selling bs magic and snake oil remedies? You are poisoning the well for real victims that wants to speak out. Guess that's nothing new for a predator like yourself.

6096 2018-12-04 15:24:46 I'd appreciate if he had written even ONE apology for any of the countless deaths he personally caused in the middle East wars for oil, Haitian asylum seeker rejections, or aids crisis, just to name a few here on Twitter. Please quote me if I missed his trial or apology.
6097 2018-12-04 15:24:39 What about that retweet was untrue though? How is stating a fact about candidate (half a million from oil and gas industry) a bash?
6098 2018-12-04 15:24:36 What are you selling? Snake oil
6099 2018-12-04 15:24:23 The White House supports the Middle East countries oil industry and to hell with people’s health and the planet earth.
6100 2018-12-04 15:24:16 As a 64 year old Indian and scientist Trump in his tremendous greed and ignorance wants to open oil drilling on east coast Spill would be devastating Oil still remains years after Alaska spill The unraveling of all the complex ecosystems mankind needs to live is slowly beginning
6101 2018-12-04 15:24:13 Little new much needed outside investment in their oil sector to say the very least
6102 2018-12-04 15:24:05 This is flat out lie.  And David knows it.  He knows that this came from individual workers employed by oil and gas (biggest employer in Texas), but he has left this here for 2 full days and counting.  He wants you to believe a lie
6103 2018-12-04 15:24:03 It may be a good thing that this game hasn't taken off. Exxon might be better at it. Years ago, Chevron produced an interactive simulation - the answer was always, "you need more oil."
6104 2018-12-04 15:23:56 gold diggers still digging til they find oil
6105 2018-12-04 15:23:52 Like two weeks ago some blue checker tweeted almost the exact same thing about Beto oil industry money but didn’t get dragged nearly as hard. Can’t remember her name though.
6106 2018-12-04 15:23:48 Ian Wood wasn't an oil tycoon, he ran a service company for the oil industry so asking his opinion on oil exploration and production in 2014 was like asking your local carrier about Amazon's current financial position and future business strategy.
6107 2018-12-04 15:23:45 Oil drilling, refining and transporting ALWAYS has mishaps - often catastrophic. Why risk it for a product that ultimately pollutes the air? ANWR is off limits
6108 2018-12-04 15:23:44 They are eatin off da oil change....
6109 2018-12-04 15:23:32 Thanks Bro, I also got mine through EB games but the wait for the midnight launch faded my receipt (must have been hand oil) that had the actual CE name on it >.> so Ill just head back in store and see what they can do for me.
6110 2018-12-04 15:23:29 You bought a pipeline, are allowing oil sands emissions to increase to 100Mt.  Ford is simply setting our target to your target. You can't complain.

6114 2018-12-04 15:23:12 45 years ago, in the midst of the first OPEC oil embargo, my high school economics teacher said cartels are an unstable economic construct and market forces will soon break it up.
Qatar just announced it will be the first member to leave the cartel.
6115 2018-12-04 15:23:04 Remember kids, FUCK the Bush family. Fuck W and his dead oil hungry daddy. One down and two ass head sons to go.
6116 2018-12-04 15:23:02 The article was not written to point out that the donation doesn’t show that oil & gas “supports Beto,” but rather that Cruz is so universally loathed that he has enemies everywhere. 

(And he STILL WON, because conservativism is a cult.)
6117 2018-12-04 15:22:59 When you go and get an oil change and are told you need new tires  always tires for this car I swear!
6118 2018-12-04 15:22:59 I also tend to only leave it on for about 30 minutes to an hour before patting the excess oil off with a damp soft face cloth. it's kind of wasteful but I'm not great at judging how much I should apply in the first place :/ I'm not so great at skincare tbh
6119 2018-12-04 15:22:58 BTW 3 days ago I also told you that oil was bottoming. Time-stamped.

6121 2018-12-04 15:22:48 Except these donations are from INDIVIDUALS that work in the Oil/Gas industry not the Oil/Gas Industry itself. So, he’s framing this as if it was PAC money from Corps - but it wasn’t. One of the main industries in TX is oil & gas. Why criticize ind donations? Disingenuous at best
6122 2018-12-04 15:22:47 They'll latch onto the next snake oil salesman that pops up. No need to reintegrate them.
6123 2018-12-04 15:22:44 Tea tree oil with warm water gargle and/or a shot of apple cider vinegar are my sore throat go-to’s.
6124 2018-12-04 15:22:37 But if oil companies raise the price the exact same amount people just grumble and fill up. France should have been much tougher on these criminals
6125 2018-12-04 15:22:24 So, Beto is simultaneously in the pocket of Big Oil and Conservation Groups because people who work for each donated to him?

LOL. So dumb, it hurts.
6126 2018-12-04 15:22:23 Junior Oil Company (circa 2010):

Junior Oil Company (circa 2019):
"Lobbying the gov't for a refund of 200k as they told me I can't produce enough oil to get an ROI" 

Welcome to nationalized oil.

6132 2018-12-04 15:21:41 By anti energy, I’m assuming you must mean anti oil? Energy resources are being developed in Alberta thru many green initiatives. Notley is doing what she can, obviously to preserve a sunsetting industry til others take the lead.
6133 2018-12-04 15:21:38 In 2019 I would love the restaurant to write on menues if there is palm oil
6134 2018-12-04 15:21:33 Good. Now France can suspend the ongoing GENOCIDE in Southern Cameroon. France can have all the oil they want once they recognize Hebrew Biafra. France for the record is a Friend of Hebrew Biafra.
6135 2018-12-04 15:21:33 @davidsirota Are you really saying it's not okay if *individual people* who work for oil & gas industry give to @BetoORourke? Are they supposed to quit their jobs first? Or is this a conspiracy by their bosses to help a political change agent? You know Beto is from TX, right?
6136 2018-12-04 15:21:30 It's just strange to see ppl defend Beto taking oil money from firms that also give to Trump. If a normal person takes money from a group that also gives to Trump they would be called a Trump supporter who is worse than someone who voted to fund ICE like Beto did with HR 1625.

6138 2018-12-04 15:21:21 A whole lot more than I care to list in a tweet but tbh I’d rather alienate voters if it means not supporting war profiteering, imperialism and neolibs who think accepting oil money from lobbyists is different from accepting a paycheck from same said oil company

6144 2018-12-04 15:21:03 I even thought about this today God knows
6145 2018-12-04 15:21:01 Beto had nothing to do with those  ads, which didn’t mention him in any way. They were by Richard Linklater, the director of DAZED AND CONFUSED, and per the article, just ONE donation to the anti-Cruz PAC that produced them was from an oil & gas exec. So what’s your point?

6168 2018-12-04 15:19:44 It seems the game is changing after the G20 in Argentina.  Of course, any manufacturing initiative will be very welcomed adding new jobs in USA.  Another important aspect is the supply of Li in order to prevent another cartel like the oil supply. China and EU also needed.

6177 2018-12-04 15:19:12 I saw that. Have you ever read Persepolis by chance? The author kind of touches on when Iraq tried to nationalize their oil reserves. And what it led to. Qatar isn’t trying to do that but I would imagine they’re sick of seeing the Saudi’s run OPEC and reap all the benefits.

6183 2018-12-04 15:18:48 coconut oil makes me break out unfortunately :/ I think it has a higher comedogenic rating than shea butter. Sweet almond oil is the same way. I do use argan oil tho, and I mix it in with the shea butter when I use it on my face to make it a bit lighter
6184 2018-12-04 15:18:39 I’m impressed with Beto... to think a Dem can raise THAT much in donations from hard working people in the oil industry in Texas... maybe the cross-over appeal Dems need? 
And, just stop it, this blatantly misleads that he took lobbying dollars. He didn’t. Period.

6189 2018-12-04 15:18:12 They've also done this to other frontrunners like Booker. Naturally, Booker is going to get more individual donations from people in finance; he's in New Jersey. Likewise, O'Rourke is going to get more individual donations from workers in gas and oil because he's in *Texas*.

In case you were wondering subsidies for coal & oil will remain, because, you know, they're morons!
6201 2018-12-04 15:17:16 Let’s see.. HRC is in bed with Wall Street, Big Oil, and MIC. Check. Bernie discloses taxes when running for Pres. Check. Sanctioning Russia for doing what we been doing to other countries for decades. Check. All searchable if you use google and not bing. Check
6202 2018-12-04 15:17:10 Easier to hunt for solar energy. Why are we still oil dependent???!!!
6203 2018-12-04 15:17:05 IMO this is a reflection of lack of jobs in the oil and gas sector which used to employ lots of young people.
6204 2018-12-04 15:17:02 Why tf are oil changes so expensive
6205 2018-12-04 15:16:55 If you think "Beto supporters" and "people who work in oil and gas" is a Venn diagram that doesn't touch then I really have nothing to say to you. He's from Texas and got millions in small dollar donation.
6206 2018-12-04 15:16:55 Second car at the dealership this morning. I needed that oil change, and I wasn't waiting all day for it either.

6209 2018-12-04 15:16:41 It would not be rational for oil company employees to donate to someone who wants to shut down their employer. I think it's reasonable to infer that he's not going to go against the interests of those donors once he gets into office.
6210 2018-12-04 15:16:39 .@michellemungall @GeorgeHeyman Don’t let industry off the hook by implementing weak methane regulations for oil and gas. Inspections based on looking and smelling for an odourless invisible gas just don’t cut it #bcpoli
6211 2018-12-04 15:16:37 Top executive of a oil company is like the government donating directly and not the teachers.
6212 2018-12-04 15:16:35 I understand, but you can’t discount the fact that gas/oil is the largest industry in Texas, and is one of the biggest in West Texas, where Beto is from. Beto’s voting record on environmental issues doesn’t fall in line with the idea that the oil industry has or can buy his vote.
6213 2018-12-04 15:16:20 Spray holy oil on her head...

6215 2018-12-04 15:16:15 India deregulated fuel prices. Petrol in 2010 and diesel in 2014. So the market price directly depends upon global crude oil price. Price today at Calicut is 74 INR for petrol! What’s the increase ?

6218 2018-12-04 15:15:54 It may be more related to the crude oil prices in anticipation of opec meeting tommorow in Vienna. Not everything is related to our politics. dont you think so?
6219 2018-12-04 15:15:54 In this case it’s an attack based on a mischaracterization of the cited data. The contributions are from employees of oil and gas companies not the companies themselves. The total amount is tiny compared to Beto’s  overall fundraising. And Beto took no $ from PACs.
6220 2018-12-04 15:15:53 So tired one day off is just not enough, 4 more days to 3 days off.  And it oil goes the way it’s going I may need a second job.

6237 2018-12-04 15:14:55 @ImranKhanPTI_FC  Can we put curb or request Pakistanis to stop buying things that cost lost of foreign exchange. For example we import lots of oil. We can ask Pakistanis not to buy petrol for one week. Or put complete halt on major imports for 1 or 2 days.

6240 2018-12-04 15:14:44 TRY weak - rallying oil not helping. But the improved inflation data 4 Nov has left people fretting that the CBRT will move too early to cut policy rates. CBRT needs to get on the front foot to commit to hold policy tight to anchor TRY.

Prohibiting campaign contributions from from fossil fuel industry specically is clearly unconstitutional.  The big oil co's are investing in renewables.  Try working with them rather than demonizing them.

6253 2018-12-04 15:13:33 The United States has reduced emissions about as much as they could possibly reduce, within reason.
Our economy is based on shipping, and Manufacturing.
During these processes, carbon dioxide is emitted.
We will never stop using oil.
It would cripple our economy.

With that in mind, this isn't non-interventionism.

6273 2018-12-04 15:12:11 It’s okay for both candidates to accept donations from people in bad industries. However, we should expect assurances that they won’t be afraid to disrupt or eliminate those industries. So for Bernie, we should hold him to speak out against the MIC, same with Beto and oil/gas.

6279 2018-12-04 15:11:49 Try putting the oil in coffee or another drink, use an immersion blender
6280 2018-12-04 15:11:45 You know damn well Beto took no corporate money. All donations were received from individuals, and likely many worked in the oil/gas industry, considering it’s Texas. Who is paying you to manipulate the truth? 

@BetoORourke
6281 2018-12-04 15:11:45 Go get coconut oil. No issue.

6284 2018-12-04 15:11:34 It’s not an oil thing! Saudi Arabia is 100% oil! It’s a ‘management’ problem. The private sector is severely hampered by govt regulations, control, & intervention. Hence, the total collapse of a once thriving economy!

The idiocy of claiming that university professors are shills, but a guy paid by Exxon is the real deal, is epic.
6294 2018-12-04 15:10:25 Denomination is not the issue. The issues are (i) what happens to the settlement proceeds & (ii) the market power of EU buyers. As with China & India the EU is structurally short oil & gas #OOTT

6310 2018-12-04 15:09:16 Quality of life requires more than money. Money is important of course. But you cant breathe money. #FireZinke and repeal the law allowing oil drilling in ANWR. Its going to matter for you in 2020
6311 2018-12-04 15:09:10 Also not allowed to use, eat or borrow anything made of plastic or transported by train, plane, boat or automobile. Must walk to work and stay out of buildings heated with oil or gas. No cheating allowed.
6312 2018-12-04 15:09:06 TouchID was awful anytime you washed your hands with soap and water which removed the oil it needed (as a physician that happened to me constantly) and didn't work at all for people 70+ who lacked enough oil glands on their skin. It left whole populations out. FaceID doesn't.

6317 2018-12-04 15:08:39 Or, it could have been my 74 year old mother in law, who was a secretary for an oilman, and is a retired oil & gas employee...
6318 2018-12-04 15:08:34 Cheaper gas n oil, thats what that means.
6319 2018-12-04 15:08:31 大変だけどがんばろー！
6320 2018-12-04 15:08:30 It means just apply groundout oil and stay at home
6321 2018-12-04 15:08:28 Problem solved. Produce less oil permanently.
6322 2018-12-04 15:08:22 COME ONNOW 

NO you can’t use my coconut oil, or my whipped shea butter. STOP ASKING!!
6323 2018-12-04 15:08:14 With everyone getting their calves cramped up over Big Oil Money vs individual contributions in excess of $200 from people in the energy industry, it seems like it would be a good time to talk about publicly funded elections, which Bernie introduced legislation for in 2015

6325 2018-12-04 15:08:01 I see Oil & gas petroleum potential is quite huge but the problem will be Nigerianic.. But who will be the first to milk it? Maybe China or France
6326 2018-12-04 15:08:00 Do...Recycle used cooking oil or properly dispose of it.  
Don't...Pour cooking oil, pan drippings, bacon grease, salad dressings, or sauces down the sink or toilet.

6327 2018-12-04 15:07:48 WTI is 35 to 42 API. Bakken produces very little crude oil according to WTI.
6328 2018-12-04 15:07:43 Iceland is blessed with geothermal. Alberta is blessed with oil and gas which contributes 120 B to the national economy. Electricity does not equate to oil and gas. It’s an entirely different economic model. AB is shutting down it’s coal plants, has a carbon tax, cap on oil sands

6330 2018-12-04 15:07:38 Consistent with Putin’s orders on Trump. To slow or stop alternative energy sources from taking place of oil/gas profits. End game: Arctic drilling!

6334 2018-12-04 15:07:26 This is a travesty of the facts. You are trying to make an oil and gas corporate donation lie when most of the individuals who live and give in Texas are employed in oil and gas. Individuals gave to Beto.
6335 2018-12-04 15:07:26 It sure looks like an attack. The way you worded it makes it sound like the money came directly from oil/gas companies. You could have said he benefited from people who work in oil/gas.
6336 2018-12-04 15:07:24 cca 400k$ r money from corporate people in oil bussines. Literally elite that represents oil bussines. But hey u can ignore that

He was a war criminal, that killed for oil.. I find it appalling that you would speak highly of him.. maybe your critics are right about you.
6345 2018-12-04 15:06:43 Don't know why but when I go to get my oil changed in my car it relaxes me.
6346 2018-12-04 15:06:40 And just because they supported something like that doesn't make them evil boogey men, this is reality and reality is that people need jobs and that oil/gas jobs are a big thing in Texas. You cannot simply cut that off overnight without massive layoffs and ruining people's lives.
6347 2018-12-04 15:06:39 That's the only thing I'm bringing I need to find someone who needs some #hydraulic oil, I don't want to just throw it away.

6374 2018-12-04 15:04:20 So if Bernie did the same he should be criticized and demanded not to take any penny out of anybody who works from oil bussines
6375 2018-12-04 15:04:17 bitchhhhhh this oil change finna take 10,00000000 years . 
6376 2018-12-04 15:04:04 Exactly.  

If you live in Texas, a lot of the people you know are going to work in oil & gas.

If you run for office in Texas, a lot of the small donors are going to work in oil & gas.  No surprise.

It's like the film industry in California, ag/food in Iowa, finance in NY.
6377 2018-12-04 15:04:03 sucking up to AIPAC is bad and so is taking huge piles of oil money

6380 2018-12-04 15:03:57 @BootstrapCook if my gram flour pancake sticks to the pan yet I have enough oil is it to do with the proportion of water to flour? Am trying to ask intelligent question but I’m stumped. 
6381 2018-12-04 15:03:55 We must courageously double the price of gasoline and heating oil, using the proceeds for affordable public housing so that people who can no longer afford to drive to work can starve and freeze in their own (publicly subsidized) apartments.
6382 2018-12-04 15:03:53 Nowhere in linked data did it say majority of $ from individual donors. In "methods", it simply says that PAC and individual contributions were combined. No breakdown.

If u are correct, exactly why would this be interesting if not for implication that Beto also tainted by oil $?
6383 2018-12-04 15:03:44 If we carry this logic through, no Dem should accept any money from anyone who works in oil/gas, chemicals, coal, etc.  Where does Sirota think Dem voters work?

6396 2018-12-04 15:02:36 Maybe...Depending on where...but then they do not get to join the first world due to intermittency. Wait for the wind etc. Still needs alot of maintenance. But they will probably go to coal/oil due to cost and no intermittency.

6400 2018-12-04 15:02:22 Generally, condensate is a very broad assessment.Before shale, there was WTI and condensate. Now, the shale industry established tight oil  between WTI and API >50. Shale  can be  now called oil although it is not WTI spec avoiding to be condensate according to  old standards.

6405 2018-12-04 15:02:00 It's more like why are the big oil industries donating so much? Why are lobbyists and wallstreet donating sooo much as well? Those types don't donate to progressives

6411 2018-12-04 15:01:48 Interior @SecretaryZinke at NPC on US oil output: We're at 11.6 million bpd now, think in two years we're going to be "marching real close to 14, if not a little higher than that"

6432 2018-12-04 15:00:32 Eh the point about the nature of the donations is valid; the big oil & gas number appears to be an artifact of open secrets’s reporting methodology more than an indication of industry leadership preference.

6447 2018-12-04 14:59:45 Going to be difficult to find many in Texas not associated with, or in the oil/gas industry.  When I made my contribution to Beto I don't recall having to list my source of income, or my occupation. Neither of which would prevent me from wanting to see him replace Ted.

6449 2018-12-04 14:59:37 The Oil supplies running out in 15 years LIAR from the 2014 campaign - Are all Tories liars?
6450 2018-12-04 14:59:37 My dad is really making me get my oil changed today ALONE. Being “grown” is stupid 
6451 2018-12-04 14:59:34 hope oil
6452 2018-12-04 14:59:33 Great.

That still doesn't change the fact that he was the #1 recipient of oil & gas donations for this cycle in the House this cycle, and #2 for all Congress.

Also doesn't change his vote to help Rs deregulate Wall St along with 77 other Ds in the House.

Or his AIPAC friends.
6453 2018-12-04 14:59:25 I've understood that padd 2 is importing oil mostly by pipe and paddle is importing by rail from Canada. Do you see any increase in padd3 imports via rail? Or iow do you see the increase in CBR shipments to padd3?
6454 2018-12-04 14:59:23 i just rubbed coconut oil all over my ass then I sat on the floor and my leg was on my uggs and now they’re stained in coconut oil  dm me if you want to contribute to a new pair. sad day
6455 2018-12-04 14:59:09 Canadian pundits love supply management for oil, hate it for milk. #priorities #cdnpoli
6456 2018-12-04 14:59:01 ان شاء الله
6457 2018-12-04 14:58:57 Then back over there Thursday to do something with the kids and get my oil changed
6458 2018-12-04 14:58:56 @mauriciomacri hace una coherente si bajas la nafta bajame el gas oil.. uno quiere ahorrar con un gasóleo y ni eso.. ya ni el verso de "ser gasolero" puedo usar gracias a vos..
6459 2018-12-04 14:58:51 As much as we “need”’the oil they want our money even more 

Enough with the bullshit!!
6460 2018-12-04 14:58:45 100% in the pocket of big oil.
He is the #2 highest recipient by big oil.  Do not be fooled.
He's just talking the talk.
6461 2018-12-04 14:58:44 It’s so good for curls with coconut oil and water it won’t make your hair hard just define your curls
6462 2018-12-04 14:58:37 Kinda yeah. It takes the oil out of you use it right
6463 2018-12-04 14:58:35 わかりみ深い
6464 2018-12-04 14:58:25 And this will help an independent Scotland oil fund revenues how, exactly?
6465 2018-12-04 14:58:24 if your entire house and all clothing doesn't smell like slightly overheated oil while you eat, then what's the point?
6466 2018-12-04 14:58:24 i got some body butter from a vendor at the market that has tea tree oil in it and my skin feels amazing right now

6469 2018-12-04 14:58:04 #Canada agreed to reduce its coal, oil and gas #ExtinctionEmissions to 385 million tonnes per year. Instead of meeting this Harper target, #Trudeau blew past it, doubling our contribution to #ClimateCancer and #MurderingMotherEarth
6470 2018-12-04 14:58:03 Me : Yh so my car, the breaks feel funny and the gears get stuck

My dad : it’s fine

* sees oil leak on floor *

Oh yeah! You can’t use your car for a bit, I think it’s bad.. could blow the engine! 

thank YOU for listening when I told you there was a problem 
6471 2018-12-04 14:58:02 Certainly what @realDonaldTrump is doing is unacceptable.  Rolling back air and water regulations is endangering our health and safety.  The sooner he (and VP Pence) is out of office the better  #TrumpRussia #BrownsLastChance (Calif. governor also failing re oil/gas)
6472 2018-12-04 14:57:57 The thing about solar power is that when it becomes cost effective the market place will naturally knock out oil and gas. What happened to kerosene lamps when cheap electric light was introduced

6479 2018-12-04 14:57:07 It's misleading in the opposite direction. The link posted in no way shows that no PAC money is included. Sirota was making it seem like Beto accepted money from only big oil and gas (untrue) while that thread is making it seem like none comes from that source (also untrue).

Would have been greasy as hell
6482 2018-12-04 14:56:34 I’m so upset I had a free car wash with my oil change and I decided to wait to get my car wash done, then I went to get my car wash while I was in Queens to then turn around and not have my ticket to get my car wash, then I go home to find out my ticket expired that day.

6485 2018-12-04 14:56:00 It’s 2018. We don’t cook with oil
6486 2018-12-04 14:55:57 “Industry” means they work for that industry. Are you saying that people should starve rather than work for the oil and gas industry?
6487 2018-12-04 14:55:56 Coating my son in CBD oil bc it's the only way I can love him
6488 2018-12-04 14:55:53 So there’s this specific foot cream at lush that has arnica oil. It helps soothe pain and ease the tension in muscles. Plus the peppermint gives it a cooling feeling that helps the cramps. I know it’s a foot cream but I use it everywhere. It’s kinda pricey but lasts FOREVER.
6489 2018-12-04 14:55:47 Have you tried Sesame or Almond Oil? Both soothing and help combat dryness.
6490 2018-12-04 14:55:37 I read an article last night that he is funded largely by big oil companies...do you know if this is true? I love Beto but with all the corruption going on lately it scares me

6492 2018-12-04 14:55:36 Read about the MEFO bills, that will make things much more clear, although this doesn't mean that their economy was completely isolated, Germany needed iron and oil and that's where mercancy exchange played its role, specially with Nordic nations.
6493 2018-12-04 14:55:25 Why keep on padding the pockets of Warren Buffet railroad pockets instead of building pipelines so land locked Alberta can move their oil?

6498 2018-12-04 14:55:08 You have been watching too much Dallas on tv. Many of us are just farmers. We don’t check our cows on helicopters and have oil wells in the backyard.

6502 2018-12-04 14:54:39 coconut oil is good for your hair but not for your skin. Not that it has no benefits but there’s other oils that do way better than coconut oil.
6503 2018-12-04 14:54:38 I think it would have been a fairer tweet if you offered the definition of “oil/gas campaign cash”.  It seems to cover execs and lower level workers.  Agree there’s nothing wrong with sharing the data though.
6504 2018-12-04 14:54:31 We are not the same sis we like water  and oil ... we don’t mix bitch
6505 2018-12-04 14:54:29 Oil is $50 a barrel. The French already pay $8 per gallon. Their max. Tax rate is 75%. Do you really think it’s about more gas tax?
6506 2018-12-04 14:54:25 Just replace water with mineral oil, and you'll be 
6507 2018-12-04 14:54:21 Can you also “drop” the rest of the data that shows individual vs corporate donations and the percentage of Beto’s donations that came from oil and gas?

6513 2018-12-04 14:53:58 Details like the wording of Sirota's tweet? "Beto is the #2 recipient of Oil and Gas industry cash"
Are we supposed to believe the Sirota doesn't realize how that reads?
6514 2018-12-04 14:53:56 Thank you moron in charge. You put Pruitt in the EPA who was an Exxon oil lobbyist and then put in Wheeler who is a coal lobbyist. Could you muddy the swamp anymore? There's still a little bit of Earth left to destroy.
6515 2018-12-04 14:53:53 People who work for oil companies in Texas? Is there another industry bigger or that employs more?  Are they all execs as you infer & will then have power over him? What is the average salary of the donor?  That should be inc or it's a mute point

6520 2018-12-04 14:53:40 I read this article a few days ago. Really frightening. Meanwhile, trump makes plans to start testing for oil off the east and west coasts. 
6521 2018-12-04 14:53:38 I’m pretty baffled by someone who says he follows the money but is unable to analyze the big picture. Where’s the criticism of Bernie Sanders and his NRA money? Where’s the criticism of every single MOC who took money from employees in the oil industry?

Was it intentionally misleading? I don't see any evidence for that. The "implications" were people assuming a nefarious motive.

6543 2018-12-04 14:51:52 It’s not incorrect, it’s misrepresented. Beto took no PAC money. He took money from individuals, and when individuals donate over $200, they have to state their field of employment. Texas has a lot of workers in the oil/gas industry, so naturally many of the donors work in that

What you said was "Beto is the #2 recipient of money from the Oil and Gas industry"
You aren't really baffled are you? because if so we may have a problem.
6553 2018-12-04 14:51:18 If the @WhiteHouse is so keen on ending EV subsidies and renewable energy subsidies, why stop there? End big oil subsidies who take the most advantage from U.S. subsidies. Gimme a break. Your just a bunch of shills. Your helping yourselves, not the American people.

6555 2018-12-04 14:51:08 That a guy running for office in TX would get a lot of money from people working for oil & gas companies is not surprising. That David Sirota would engage in this kind of weird, deceptive attacking-by-implication is.
6556 2018-12-04 14:51:07 But he failed. All he proved was Beto did surprisingly well TX with oil and gas WORKERS who were compelled to donate to his campaign as a Dem. 

Attacks on Beto always seem to make him look better!!!

6560 2018-12-04 14:50:54 He took money from voters who happen to work for oil industries. Also, you need to see the entire data set. The money from these donors is minuscule compared to other donors. I think you fell victim to David’s misleading data.

6581 2018-12-04 14:49:10 And why don't we end subsidies for oil and gas!?! Oh, yea... Lobbyists! 

Level of frustration is through the roof...

6584 2018-12-04 14:48:52 I recently had the opportunity to vote for a carbon tax. Sadly, big oil scared enough people to vote against it by the numbers they used. I don’t think that people saw it as anything but another tax. No long term thinking. It failed miserably. Bill Gates did ad for it.
6585 2018-12-04 14:48:51 The DJI and SP 500 climbed yesterday and U.S. crude oil surged. 

However, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note closed below 3% for the first time since September. Global stocks today are relinquishing some of their early-week gains...

6588 2018-12-04 14:48:45 @cathmckenna defends her climate change policies against a UN report that says Canada is among many countries failing to meet Paris targets. Her statement adds that Canada is resource (oil) economy and will take decades to reverse. We don't have decades minister!!! #ClimateChange

6590 2018-12-04 14:48:43 The Venezuelanization of our Oil industry is nearing completion. It's a  scope creep NEP, millennium style.

- construction workers bad
- carbon bad
- pipelines bad

Our answer? Nationalize the pipe, restrict the flow, and subsidize the rest. 

Would you invest in that?????

6594 2018-12-04 14:48:30 Wllh I only recognize his candidacy because it is what is expected in a democracy
6595 2018-12-04 14:48:20 Yes he does have support of the base. I know plenty of POC & WOC who support his message and caucus progressive instead of moderate. The real toxin of our party are the people who accept donations from oil/gas companies and military contractors then pretend they're progressive.
6596 2018-12-04 14:48:19 Lol it was the steam from the oil
6597 2018-12-04 14:48:19 You're ascribing motives to @davidsirota that aren't there. Search "beto from:davidsirota". He has posted a number of positive and neutral tweets about Beto. He has been consistent about raising the alarm about and monitoring the oil & gas industry. This is not a hack job.
6598 2018-12-04 14:48:11 Project FY19 inflation at ~7.5% which may further escalate due to recent  PKR devaluation. Furthermore low international oil prices (if sustain)  coupled with  PKR devaluation would ease current account deficit and in result will support foreign exchange reserves.

6616 2018-12-04 14:46:40 I voted for Sanders, I think Clinton epitomizes the corporate Democratic Party in the most pejorative sense.

AND your clear insinuation that Beto is supported by the oil industry — rather than individuals who happen to work for it -- is complete and utter bullshit.

6623 2018-12-04 14:46:17 Does your original tweet tell the common person reading it: Wow Beto is great at fundraising everywhere? OR does it more likely, & possibly inadvertently tell the common reader: Wow Beto is bought and paid for by gas & oil money? 
6624 2018-12-04 14:46:15 This isn’t the 1st time I’ve mentioned it, genius. Also, there are environmentalists in the “oil industry”. That was the point. Who do you think cleans that crap so you can be smug surrounded by plastic?

6631 2018-12-04 14:45:39 The claim that the contributions Beto received from the oil and gas industry were " small dollar" is a bold faced lie.  The truth is that the Federal Election Commission doesn't require disclosures of small dollar (less than $200) contributions.
6632 2018-12-04 14:45:36 But the upcoming OPEC meeting might change oil prices?
6633 2018-12-04 14:45:34 中学まではよかったのに
6634 2018-12-04 14:45:30 Here is a defense: They were from individuals in TX, where he was running, who wanted to see him represent them. TX has a high number of oil and gas jobs. It was a bad tweet, intended to smear Beto, but with just enough plausible deniability that you were trying to "inform". SMH

6640 2018-12-04 14:44:55 In addition to reducing costs of keeping our air clean & reducing our dependence on foreign oil, Tesla created tens of thousands of tax-paying American jobs.

6643 2018-12-04 14:44:34 Math is a thing. Individual contribution maximum is $2700. Beto got exponentially more than that in the fossil fuel category. Does the # of oil CEOs x $2700 = the total Beto received? Take your time.
6644 2018-12-04 14:44:28 My ESA had the worst seizure she has had to date last night.  It was awful and lasted over 5 hours.  Can anyone suggest an effective CBD dog treat/oil I can use to help curb the seizures?  Help   :(
6645 2018-12-04 14:44:27 well, isn't air pollution mainly result of nitrogen oxides and VOCs I believe. That's what we call smog.  CO2 is creating global warming.  Both come from the same culprits generally speaking (car exhaust, oil/gas refineries, coal production)..  are you listening? @SenCoryGardner
6646 2018-12-04 14:44:23 Beto does live in Texas. Isn't that where majority Texas money comes from? Why are you surprised Beto got money from donors in oil? Where else would he get it from in Texas?

6650 2018-12-04 14:43:38 Renewable energy will create jobs but those who are in the oil and gas industry, like myself will lose our jobs? They always want to say those in oil and gas and coal can get jobs in renewable energy. Not true. They'll end up hiring kids out of college and pay the a lot less.

6656 2018-12-04 14:43:16 Companies often use their employees to get around the donation limit by giving each of them thousands of dollars to donate. Oil workers donating = Oil companies donating.

6658 2018-12-04 14:43:12 Global stocks and oil prices rose yesterday after an easing of political tensions. Bond investors, however, signaled the anxiety that has gripped markets for the past two months has yet to abate. ..
6659 2018-12-04 14:43:05 Any decline/slow-down in U.S. drilling is ultimately GOOD for long-run/sustainable U.S. IP/PMI activity bc it would support oil prices (being that U.S. is biggest incremental growth driver of supply globally) in the Goldilocks range ($50-70/bbl)

6661 2018-12-04 14:43:03 This is the significance in context—Beto’s donations from people who work for companies classified as in the oil & gas industry, and the total he raised with no PAC money:

$429,752 out of $69,100,000 = 0.62%

Which is a stupid move, you don't raise the tax on something to refrain from people getting it. How about passing laws to benefit renewable energy and fuels for automobiles..

6697 2018-12-04 14:39:47 Also, FFS, oil/gas is a major industry *in Texas*. Only significance of this is that Beto was popular *with his potential constituents*. (Which is exactly why the Bros are after him.)

6720 2018-12-04 14:37:53 Except Beto didn't take any PAC money so this money is actually coming from employees of oil/gas companies...which is still one of the main employers in Texas.
6721 2018-12-04 14:37:47 Yep. Hillary in NY had Wall Street and financial market employees who supported her.  Beto in Texas has oil and gas market employees who support him.  They are CONSTITUENT donations - not bribes.
6722 2018-12-04 14:37:46 Had Peter Lougheed not fought Pierre Trudeau over the National Energy Programme, we'd be in a different place. Alberta decided then that it's oil was a provincial resource, instead of a national one. It still feels this way. Albertans are Albertans first and Canadians second.

6726 2018-12-04 14:37:27 The New World Order though just became the Oil World Order. 
Cold War politics declined, but securing reserves & broadening markets always took priority over concern for global human suffering.
6727 2018-12-04 14:37:26 Wake up, it's the net neutrality.
6728 2018-12-04 14:37:07 A max out at the federal level is NOTHING compared to what an actual oil industry PAC could give to a campaign. He’s still not taking the corporate pac money he’s pledged against. Ignore the huge difference shows you don’t really care about the facts here.
6729 2018-12-04 14:37:05 i’m just slightly irritated my little sister fixed this chick car . Wish she betrayed me before then. so then brake pads would’ve stayed fucked up and the oil didn’t get changed. and you wouldn’t know it was serious to get your trans fixed 
6730 2018-12-04 14:37:05 Make sure 1000mg highest grade. Natural anflamitory, anxiety, overall mood and provides pure rem sleep. Non psychotropic effects, for that use thc oil, edibles or smoke.
6731 2018-12-04 14:36:56 From EMPLOYEES in the oil and gas industry. It's effing Texas you twatwaffle, where oil & gas is one of the biggest employers. 
6732 2018-12-04 14:36:48 People believes it's oil job, I don't know yet
6733 2018-12-04 14:36:45 400 gm a day sounds like what I've upped it too. A favorite meal is oven roasting a LOT of one of my 3 favorites - okra, cauliflower, eggplant. With masalas & a "good" oil. And have that with a side of dal. Filling and satisfying. Once in a while, a serving of rice or roti with.
6734 2018-12-04 14:36:41 merci. vous auriez un lien ?
6735 2018-12-04 14:36:28 Of course he will...they will limit his rich buddies OIL/gas enrichment!!
6736 2018-12-04 14:36:27 I don’t buy this. Texas is producing more oil than ever and this is a short term downward blip. Texas oil industry is stable and lower gas prices help everyone.
6737 2018-12-04 14:36:26 thank you!! i make oil paintings outside of digital work and sometimes i like to apply some of the visual language i've learned there into photo-color studies! 
6738 2018-12-04 14:36:24 Thank you both for pointing this out. My husband and I both donated to Beto’s campaign every month, separately. He is an EMPLOYEE of an oil and gas company. *Required* fields on the donation form is profession and I believe industry as well.
6739 2018-12-04 14:36:13 Great article. "So, how you talk about climate change matters." We still need to remember that US oil giants have spent more than $100 million (1995 to 2010 according to some estimates) on funding for anti-climate science lobby groups. 1/2
6740 2018-12-04 14:36:12 Even with the "bounce" in #oil and other #commodities, 5Y inflation BE now 177 bps.

But please financial media, both legacy and independent, continue bringing on the summer inflationistas.

6742 2018-12-04 14:35:56 Well said. Some one stated there are food banks in lots of countries. What ? Scotland an oil producing country and we have food banks. Ffs. What’s wrong with people. Boils my blood.

6744 2018-12-04 14:35:52 I would like to see a system when fuel duty automatically goes up if the price of oil comes down, so as to create a minimal fuel price.
6745 2018-12-04 14:35:33 RT littleidea: RT nsaphra: #HappyChanukah and don't forget the lessons of the season:
- We can get by on less oil
- A small band of violent fanatics versed in guerrilla tactics can effect change
- Fire is pretty
6746 2018-12-04 14:35:30 I wish Canadians would react similarly (but without damage/flipping & burning cars etc).  I just got laid off this past Friday.  This was directly due to our oil situation.  Once oil goes down eventually small towns die and many surrounding businesses as well.   It’s sad to watch
6747 2018-12-04 14:35:19 I went 12k last year. Synthetic oil. Not a problem.
6748 2018-12-04 14:35:19 I’ve inherited 90 acres of forested south Arkansas land with oil under it. How do I manage that land for maximum CO2 absorption?

6750 2018-12-04 14:35:18 Never cook with butter. What oil is healthiest? Extra virgin olive oil! It contains monounsaturated fat and helps keep cholesterol down!
6751 2018-12-04 14:35:17 “literally the only thing i drink and cook with is olive oil” 

NOBODY in my class just reacted to that statement made by my professor but i am calling THE POLICE

6758 2018-12-04 14:34:41 Just filled up on gas for under $2/gallon.  Nice to see the oil companies supporting broke people for Christmas.
6759 2018-12-04 14:34:28 Answer: The United States will not be able to stop Iran from exporting oil. Any attempts to prevent Iran's Iranian gas supplies from the Persian Gulf will lead to a total ban on oil exports, oh !! No comment
6760 2018-12-04 14:34:18 My back coulda solve an oil crisis rn
6761 2018-12-04 14:34:15 I’m at 3,800 cals per day to gain 1/2 lbs per week.

So no. Not really. Lol.

I suppose I could eat 7 lbs of steak and chug a gallon of olive oil lol
6762 2018-12-04 14:34:05 Ok, so... the NRA is going bankrupt and lost a record amount of money last year. They cannot both be bankrupt and massive donors of the Republican Party. Barack Obama took credit for huge oil production recently, “that was me folks” if it’s so bad, why is he taking credit?
6763 2018-12-04 14:33:53 I need to go get an oil change..
6764 2018-12-04 14:33:52 Never mind that, have you put some oil in the poor thing yet?! 
6765 2018-12-04 14:33:51 や～～朕欲しすぎんなまじて、、
6766 2018-12-04 14:33:48 Don't do it Joe. What have qualifications got to do with it???

Snake oil, bluster, medacity and good old foreign intervention seem to be a good substitute!
6767 2018-12-04 14:33:47 The US Saudi Alliance needs of overhauling. They are our 2nd largest supplier of oil, yet the relationship comes w/ a price, Wahabi terrorism. Princess Haifa gave the 9/11 hijackers money, & then there was Abu Zubadah. Saud profits from instability. More war = more Oil purchases.
6768 2018-12-04 14:33:47 Again...it's not the warranty. It's the cost of the oil change.
6769 2018-12-04 14:33:42 Oil prices running down 
6770 2018-12-04 14:33:40 Seriously @jjz1600? Figured you might be smart enough to traffic in facts but alas I was wrong. Please show us Beto’s PAC receipts. While you’re at it show us the percentage of overall campaign contributions he received from INDIVIDUALS who work in the oil and gas industry.

6772 2018-12-04 14:33:28 They’ve been guilty since  efore, during/after 911. They hold so much oil power that everyone’s afraid to do something; that’s why we must get our own oil so we’re no longer dependent on Saudi Arabia
6773 2018-12-04 14:33:21 RT @Missz_Jay: Something wrong with my car I hope I just need an oil change 
6774 2018-12-04 14:33:20 You understand that it's company employees who donated, correct? Normal middle class people, not some corporation or business who donated. 

Also, gas station employees count as "oil and gas industry", so that tweet from that journalist is irresponsible without giving more detail
6775 2018-12-04 14:33:19 Hillary in NY had Wall Street and financial market employees who supported her.  Beto in Texas has oil and gas market employees who support him.  They are CONSTITUENT donations - not bribes.

6786 2018-12-04 14:32:29 .Juli8Bot Careful! You almost shot hot oil in my eye!
6787 2018-12-04 14:32:14 So what’s being said here? B/c he’s from Texas it’s OK to accept money from oil? That money doesn’t buy influence? From the way ppl are talking-up Beto as a “progressive,” even  a 2020 candidate, it’s news to me. AOC took it I’d be shocked/heartbroken.
6788 2018-12-04 14:32:10 Is it writing on wall to cryptic for some Albertans? Oil is soo last century, consider offering education to create new ideas

6792 2018-12-04 14:31:36 My car needs an oil change and new tires
6793 2018-12-04 14:31:35 Oil and gas people that donated to Beto probably donated to Cruz as well. They do it to cover their bases. A $2700 donation each cycle is a small price to pay when you make big money. Sirota is right, Beto took big individual donations, no reason to bang on Sirota.
6794 2018-12-04 14:31:32 Pierre seems to be able to transport enough oil in his hair to negate the need for a pipeline
6795 2018-12-04 14:31:29 Its texas. Both of them are gonna get money from gas/oil no matter what.
6796 2018-12-04 14:31:27 He didn’t get any money from oil companies.
6797 2018-12-04 14:31:22 Your... oil change is covered under warranty?
6798 2018-12-04 14:31:18 Well....Crude oil is about to smash to sub 53 so take it easy for now !!!
6799 2018-12-04 14:31:03 problem with $DAI as currency at least right now is that you also need to have internet oil to use it.  This needs to be solved in some fashion.  No one buys a cup of coffee with cash and a few ounces of oil.

6801 2018-12-04 14:31:00 Stay with those who bankrupted a very oil rich UK cos 300 years is a long time.

6810 2018-12-04 14:30:23 do i have any haters that also own a few oil companies because for $5M I quit
6811 2018-12-04 14:30:15 I left it off b/c people can look at the whole list for themselves and clearly says individual donations in the column & in bright red at the bottom.

Two, it was regarding oil and gas.

Last, naming donations from big bank employees might explain his Wall St deregulation vote
6812 2018-12-04 14:30:10 0.5% of his total campaign funds came from employees of the oil & gas sector. That’s huge? You don’t seem to know the difference between big and tiny.

6816 2018-12-04 14:30:03 I wish people would understand why some companies are ‘boycotting’ the oil sands here in Canada. Look some shit up about climate change and realize that having your insides dug out from inside you would cause you to die too.

6826 2018-12-04 14:29:45 My late teen years was a struggle with it tbh. I used bio oil and all sort, especially on my bicep area , I started gyming then and my skin started to stretch. I eventually got tired of trying and got used to it, tbh it doesn’t feel like it’s there, just don’t point it out.
6827 2018-12-04 14:29:33 Want to start learning how to oil paint. Anyone have any tips on where to start - equipment, videos, forums etc? Would like to join a class in the new year, but practice at home :)
6828 2018-12-04 14:29:29 Who be that mad person 
6829 2018-12-04 14:29:26 I like Kamala too. Didn't realize Beto took so much money from the oil producers but he also voted to tax them more steeply. Not sure I agree he would F over everyone who isn't white, but I certainly recognize your concern.
6830 2018-12-04 14:29:14 じゃあマーシーするね
6831 2018-12-04 14:29:13 It was both. Are y’all new? Oil execs and execs in general give to Dems and republicans because they don’t know who will win, it’s a strategy and has no bearing on whether Beto would be pliant to their wishes. FFS

6839 2018-12-04 14:28:55 Bob Woodward was promoting his book in MN yesterday & taking questions.  Selling snake oil for $$. He stated Trump does not have the people in place to take on huge problems (paraphrasing). Take a look around the globe Bob-North Korea, China, Russia, Mexico, Canada, & others.
6840 2018-12-04 14:28:51 You're right. JT dropped the ball.    He should never have backtracked after talking about phasing out fossil fuels. 
Only fools cling to the hope of another oil boom. #divest
6841 2018-12-04 14:28:50 Brent Crude Oil dropped to about $62 per barrel from $87 per barrel with USD/ZAR reasonable ($1:R13.67) stable there should be a substantial drop in the petrol price over the next few months. Lets hope.
6842 2018-12-04 14:28:49 Something wrong with my car I hope I just need an oil change 
6843 2018-12-04 14:28:39 They both look pretty cheap! Not the biggest yields but solid P/Es. I don't see oil staying this low for long.
6844 2018-12-04 14:28:35 That was MY oil

6847 2018-12-04 14:28:30 This reflects folks that work for the oil industry ... #BETO didn’t take any PAC funding. You can’t run in Texas and have zero expectation that monies earned by the oil industry work force won’t be donated to a campaign. 

Mr Sirota is simply  fling’n
6848 2018-12-04 14:28:27 Spoke to a Market Maker today on #UJO they’re filling an order. So expect there’s more TR1s in the pipeline. Big buyer out there, either it’s ‘Lord Chris Oil’ or another etc.
6849 2018-12-04 14:28:23 Also not sure whether the differentiation between 'oil' and 'data', because oil is part of nature, is actually fair. Maybe a bit essentialistic. The appropriation of oil also takes significant reconfiguration through infrastructures and labour. #BigDataSur

That is why over 85% of their budgets are funded by oil.Projects in our budget supposed to be funded by oil are in some cases non existent but the money released alright. It isn't how big ur reserves are. It's how you use it
6855 2018-12-04 14:27:57 So taking money from big oil, who's helping destroy the planet, is ok as long as you support the person taking it.

6861 2018-12-04 14:27:24 That is just not correct. Your warranty is not dependent on work being done at the dealer you bought the car from. It would violate about ten different federal laws. You can get the oil changed anywhere and keep the receipt. They'll have a hard time denying warranty coverage.

6885 2018-12-04 14:25:55 Beto was running in Texas.  Oil and gas is huge in Texas.  It employs a huge number of people.  Many of them contributed to Beto.  These were not pacs but individuals.  That's all this means.  The implication is misleading.

6901 2018-12-04 14:25:05 Strange that investments in oil and gas are maintained though.
6902 2018-12-04 14:25:02 However, market fear induced by Geopolitical developments ; the mark-up supply by Russia which is a non-OPEC member (hence with less production advantages) and obvious signals towards production cuts by major OPEC Members - oil prices could definitely be headed upward.
6903 2018-12-04 14:24:54 It also shows that Alberta oil and gas companies are very poor at managing their industry.

6912 2018-12-04 14:24:06 Out of the nearly $70,000,000 in donations he received, about $450,000 came from people who work in the oil and gas industry. I think this is probably why you purposely cut that number off.

6916 2018-12-04 14:23:55 Beto takes oil money. He won’t be a climate ally. Which means he would just be another rich white guy who would fuck over everyone who isn’t white.

6966 2018-12-04 14:18:54 Everyone enjoys low energy costs but remember that low market prices for crude oil and natural gas also hurt the providers of the fuel to operate your trucks & cars. The people working to provide energy independence suffer when markets are low.

6990 2018-12-04 14:17:05 It is not a coincidence that there are horrible riots in France about oil prices. Oil is a big part of the underlying agenda of Trump and Putin and the American 1%. It’s part of their end game....it’s all connected
6991 2018-12-04 14:16:52 We just gave the oil companies hundreds of billions of dollars in the tax cut... maybe if they paid their own goddamn fair share wouldn’t have to increased taxes on us...

6. Exfoliate once a week. Can be done with clay mask, konjac sponge or gentle scrubs.

7001 2018-12-04 14:16:05 Hey @RadioAmy did you know that tea tree oil is a natural deterrent? My kids had lice all the time (like 2 years ago). Started putting tea tree oil in our shampoo/conditioner. NEVER CAME BACK! Plus, it smells yummy. Also, we coated our hair with coconut oil overnight. 
7002 2018-12-04 14:16:03 I had one for some sort of car oil in mine, I post pictures of pets and books... totally irrelevant

7004 2018-12-04 14:15:53 everything that i have read on this says that you can do your own maintenance ie. oil changes as long as you keep a log and the receipts for the oil and filter. same for a garage you go there for other work. Warranty work probably needs to be done at the dealer, that makes sense

7008 2018-12-04 14:15:38 Qatar was one of the smallest oil producers among OPEC members. Major oil price fluctuations are rather attributed to production levels from Saudi Arabia and Russia (non - OPEC) which at present have committed to keep the supply intact and hence relatively the oil prices.

“Aloe Vera ruined my life.”
“You can smell what I ate cuz it seeps out my pores.”
“You don’t know if you’re gay til you try it.”
“One time I ate a hot pepper and put baby oil in my mouth. Didn’t work, and now I hate baby oil.”

7125 2018-12-04 14:07:20 Very creative!!!!     I mean documentaries about a  race baiting tax evading tawana Brawley mee too movement framing low life scumbag snake oil salesmen are in vogue right now.    Could be a win win!!     Lol.      Even Hillary wouldn’t have the balls to do this.
7126 2018-12-04 14:07:18 Beto ran in Texas, a place that has a shit ton of oil and gas workers, it wouldn't make any sense not to have some of them donate to him. It's the nature of the state and he was running for a state wide office
7127 2018-12-04 14:07:11 I'm way too late to be of any help now. Did you find a solution?
I would have started with olive oil.
7128 2018-12-04 14:07:10 Never seen this sorta aggression towards a food that doesn’t kill an animal.. are you a cabbage-saving your fam? #TipsAndTricksTuesday: Make it w/ a little olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette instead of Mayo (Then feel free eating it all w/ no guilt-red cabbage is great for you)
7129 2018-12-04 14:07:00 this blunt finna have me sittin all glossy in the oil shop 
7130 2018-12-04 14:07:00 Well, just look at him.  Is he the last man on earth to use oil on his hair?
7131 2018-12-04 14:06:59 I slept so good last night and I'm pretty sure it was because I put an insane amount of lavender oil in my pillow lmao
7132 2018-12-04 14:06:58 Are you serious? Do you realize how many people in *Texas* work in the oil industry?

7135 2018-12-04 14:06:48 Just put oil and coolant in my truck. And I didn’t have to call my dad for help. 
7136 2018-12-04 14:06:48 かわええなー。
7137 2018-12-04 14:06:45 That picture just say top twenty members of the house. It’s taken hella out of context. Also, any money from individuals who work for an oil/gas company counts as money from that industry. Beto’s from TX. Down here, everyone’s got oil money.
7138 2018-12-04 14:06:28 Wait a minute, are you telling me that people who work for the oil and gas industry live and vote in Texas?  And some of them might be...Democrats?
7139 2018-12-04 14:06:22 Looks like an oil well!

7141 2018-12-04 14:06:12 I blame feminism
7142 2018-12-04 14:06:12 That's lies. I've never went to the dealer for my oil changes. And sometimes I go a LOT longer than they recommend
7143 2018-12-04 14:06:07 Wow! And the oil & water don't get weird with each other? Huh. I might have to try this!
7144 2018-12-04 14:06:02 What happened to Iraq after they sold oil in euros instead of dollars?
7145 2018-12-04 14:06:00 The info Dr. Jim shares is valuable in understanding why CBD oil is healthy for us.
7146 2018-12-04 14:05:57 Semi-optimistic. The last 4 yrs have been great, for me & my family. I worry that goals to diversify, wean from oil & meet climate targets will be derailed if the UCP are elected. I'm terrified a Jason Kenney Premiership will be the deathknell of Alberta's environment.
7147 2018-12-04 14:05:57 Okay let me go get my oil change while it’s still early

7150 2018-12-04 14:05:48 Punching left never gets old for the folks who wanted to steal Libya's oil.
7151 2018-12-04 14:05:36 no one wants to buy our oil for a decent price. It's too expensive to refine. That's why the companies bailed. The days of the oil boom are gone and they aren't coming back
7152 2018-12-04 14:05:32 when you find out your fav granola has palm oil  WHYYY
7153 2018-12-04 14:05:26 #hypocrit A lot of the countries with #schengen free movement are just as corrupt as our government, one of them never has free #elections, some cannot even control their borders. Yet you punish the weak ones. I suppose if we had #oil or # gas we could skip the cue.
7154 2018-12-04 14:05:20 Y’all missed out on two main points
1. Bush created off shore oil rigs as a way to attack Cuba in the early 60’s 
B. Roger Stone connection to Bush through to Trump
7155 2018-12-04 14:05:18 We need the ones we have for now, but soon they mostly must stop shipping oil too.

7158 2018-12-04 14:05:03 The left wing Brexit you believe in will never be allowed to happen. Look at the major advocates, all snake oil salesmen for disaster capitalists ready to profit off ordinary people's misery. Now look at the strength of Ireland in the EU, forced the UK to capitulate on the border

7161 2018-12-04 14:04:48 No. I could give a shit less about Bernie's money. The entire point of the absurd argument is that you're attacking a guy because 0.6% of his $70 million came from INDIVIDUAL donations of Oil/Gas employees.
7162 2018-12-04 14:04:32 Sana oil happy :((
7163 2018-12-04 14:04:28 You know he is from Texas right. Many of us-I mean MANY of us in cities in TX work for oil and gas. I for one do and I also donated a ton to Beto.
7164 2018-12-04 14:04:19 Man super surprised a guy from Texas has people donating money from the oil and gas industry.

Look up the Barcelona Agreement from the 70s peeps. The UK and greed for oil is what set us up for this.

7174 2018-12-04 14:03:33 We are on our 3rd starting QB and have a defense that is leaking oil and fluid all over the place.

7194 2018-12-04 14:01:59 Is there a master list of "Things Killing the Planet" right next to "GOP bills that will kill people" somewhere? 

I feel like I'm not keeping up.
7195 2018-12-04 14:01:46 @amberkanwar Interesting to note that Eric Nuttall's bullish oil thesis is premised on the withholding of substantial production by OPEC et al and now Canada (read:  market manipulation), and ignores basic economic theory surrounding price and marginal cost.  He's unaware.
7196 2018-12-04 14:01:43 The only “clean coal” facility in Texas, Petra Nova, is using the CO2 it extracts from one out of nine turbines (when it’s working, which it isn’t always) to enhance oil and gas recovery, thus increasing the overall carbon footprint. Yup.

7201 2018-12-04 14:01:31 It would be helpful if it showed the LARGE number of individuals who work in oil in Texas (hello...isn't that like the largest employer in Texas???) donated to Beto. Large corporations, however, did not. Why? Because Beto refused to accept large corporate donations.

7251 2018-12-04 13:58:07 There was a glut of oil on the market before JT.  The US was funding a campaign to keep ours landlocked bc they were sitting on a huge reserve. Now their production is way up and selling to world markets.Our production us landlocked and selling super cheap the US only.

7321 2018-12-04 13:51:16 Dead on with your first point though. And I think your third is close to the mark, but with a simpler explanation: There are a lot of left-leaning people, or even right-leaning people that just despise Cruz, in the oil and gas industry just as in many other Texas industries.
7322 2018-12-04 13:51:11 Whyare we required to pretend this war criminal was a good man simply because he's freshly dead? He murdered countless civillians for his personal crusade for oil in Kuwait and we're still dealing with the terrorism that was born of it. Plus #GeorgeBushMadeWillieHorntonAds
7323 2018-12-04 13:51:05 And to start a war with an oil rich country. All for oil. God will judge then. Maybe even here on earth if we are lucky.
7324 2018-12-04 13:51:00 She was wrong too. Employee contributions are small donor contributions and need to be labeled as such, regardless of for whom they work. It’s logical that someone from Texas might have contributions from employees of oil and gas companies since they’re major employers.
7325 2018-12-04 13:50:59 ร้ายกาจมากกก
7326 2018-12-04 13:50:57 Texas produces 3x more oil than any other state. This data tallies individual & PAC contributions >$200. Obvi the 2 Sen candidates from state that produces the most oil got the most $$ from people who work in that industry. Difference is Beto’s is all people and Cruz took PAC $.

7332 2018-12-04 13:50:42 OIL: Oil prices rose more than 2 percent, extending gains ahead of expected output cuts by producer cartel OPEC and a mandated reduction in Canadian supply.
7333 2018-12-04 13:50:36 Why are you spreading lies about Beto. You’re not too dumb to not be able differentiate between oil and gas corps and workers
7334 2018-12-04 13:50:33 Big Oil will keep doing oil exploration for as long as they are able and are allowed to do so. When all coast cities are below the ocean surface, they will keep up the production if there is profit to be made. That is their nature.
7335 2018-12-04 13:50:28 I work in the oilfield. Does she not understand what one barrel of oil makes for society which everyone uses on a daily basis. What comes from the oil is medicines, plastics, make-up that she is wearing, her clothes, toothbrush, 1000's of items. Everyone needs to google about oil
7336 2018-12-04 13:50:23 The context is that he received his campaign funds exclusively through individual donations instead of PACs, and many Texan donors (who have to disclose their profession upon donating) work in oil & gas by virtue of living in Texas. Cool early Beto the Boogeyman story though!
7337 2018-12-04 13:50:23 Yes! Organic unrefined coconut oil and it's natural with no chemicals...
7338 2018-12-04 13:50:20 U do have a great memory, your comments are true and the war thing was screwed up and his tech suppression for oil was detailed, there's a lot there.  tomorrow's topic's.

7340 2018-12-04 13:50:19 The United States will not be able to stop Iran exporting its oil and any move to prevent Iranian crude shipments passing through the Gulf would lead to all oil exports through the waterway being blocked, Iran's president said on Tuesday.

7344 2018-12-04 13:50:08 Talk has been going on since the late 1970s. Even then, people were aware of the problem. Then came the oil industry and exerted its influence. Global problems need global solutions, not just lip service. The madness must end now.
7345 2018-12-04 13:50:03 I am a rape survivor as well. But that does not excuse your behaviour of painting a whole population with the same brush. You can’t publicly call most oil field guys rapists because of your experience. Because it wasn’t the whole population it was one man
7346 2018-12-04 13:50:02 OPEC meets on Thursday in Vienna, followed by talks with allies such as Russia on Friday, amid a drop in crude prices caused by global economic weakness and concerns about an oil glut due largely to a rise in U.S. production.

7369 2018-12-04 13:48:40 Plus doesn’t the list factor in employees of the oil and gas industry? Being that he’s from an oil rich state like Texas that could also be a factor too.

7371 2018-12-04 13:48:31 This exact distinction is the one being made. You claim he was twisting words, being misleading, he never said big oil, representing oil orgs. He said it once when it was accurate, later on

But hey, keep your irrational Bernie hated going. But I expect your vote in the 2020 gen.

7374 2018-12-04 13:48:28 I’m quite capable of not only reading Open Secrets but also looking at FEC filings of donor lists. Beto may not take PAC money, but he gets big money from big donors — owners, execs, and managers. His oil and gas numbers tell us a lot.
7375 2018-12-04 13:48:28 Hedge fund managers had largely completed the recent wave of selling in crude oil futures and options by the middle of last week but there were heavy sales of derivatives linked to middle distillates.
7376 2018-12-04 13:48:25 Respectfully speaking sir.
It would be unrealistic for Beto to not take money from gas and oil donors here in Texas.
I'm not a bit surprised.
There are progressive oil and gas people down here.

7389 2018-12-04 13:47:29 Actually the NDP siding with the Federal Liberal got us in this place and the anti oil policy of both Governments you should be ashamed to still be in government! You destroyed Alberta that is your legacy
7390 2018-12-04 13:47:20 $cei oil up  , WAITING ON THE KANAS THING , hmmmm  MARKET CLOSED WEDNESDAY , TOMMORROW , whats the chances oil keeps going up and by thursday PRE-MARKET we see news ks deal done, and oil rocketed , AND OF COURSE maybe another suprise ?? bam ! maybe
7391 2018-12-04 13:47:18 That's exactly what you've been saying for too long now, time to roll up your sleeves and start demanding those pipelines, if Trudeau and his government still refuse then let's show the east how much they need us and our oil. Time for Alberta to go on strike!
7392 2018-12-04 13:47:15 Changed days I guess, never knew a teacher, and I have known plenty, who became one for money. Even my mate who, after years in oil and gas, is now on placement as part of his training. He's literally never mentioned the money, just something he always wanted to do.
7393 2018-12-04 13:47:13 Chef Skinner cut up some bars of soap, adding them to a pot of boiling oil. Finally, was a fine cut of beef, along with toast.
7394 2018-12-04 13:47:12 And in the beginning, God created oil and coal, and He called it good.  Time for a meltdown?
7395 2018-12-04 13:47:09 Grot build up like that was pretty standard for a Ford CVH engine back in the day. Even if you changed the oil regularly too 
7396 2018-12-04 13:46:48 I don't understand the positive that you get by kicking over 10k people off of Medicaid.  This will cost us more by an order of magnitude when they show up at the ER with untreated illnesses.  This is like saving money on car maintenance by never changing your oil.
7397 2018-12-04 13:46:38 Perception is interesting. In 2008 Oil Cos were gouging US. The word she was searching for was “nationalizing, yes. Something she described as an “extreme step” but, 1 that might be necessary if outsize profits/exorbitant gasoline prices continued. You mad she put Shell on blast?
7398 2018-12-04 13:46:28 @marksandspencer “All Butter” mince pies are actually made with palm oil. #lies
7399 2018-12-04 13:46:23 Coconut oil & then an avocado mask. I know the scalp burns a lot. Trust, I’ve had the rainbow for hair. Lol you also wanna try to not wash it before getting it done. The dirt helps sometimes lol
7400 2018-12-04 13:46:23 These donations are from individuals, not corporations or PACs. Oil is a major employer in Texas.
7401 2018-12-04 13:46:21 At least the drop in oil prices has slowed production down!
7402 2018-12-04 13:46:16 natural oil ってあるから実際油膜なんだろうな＞RT
7403 2018-12-04 13:46:11 //random thought but: lance jokingly getting keith oil blotting sheets as a gift for the holidays bc that boy has got super oily skin
7404 2018-12-04 13:46:09 No doubt. Insurance rates, cargo financing, too. They are clever operators. I could see them initiating a policy of low-level quasi-military harassment of selected oil tankers. Boarding, detaining crew members, seizing documents, etc. Actions calculated to be just short of war.
7405 2018-12-04 13:46:09 ไปเจอรูปไม่กี่เดือนก่อน อยากเล่นจ้องตามาก มีแค่กยูริคนเดียวที่กล้าเล่นมั่ง จ้องจนคุณซงอายเลย 
7406 2018-12-04 13:46:02 Republicans worship: oil, coal, and murderous dictators.
7407 2018-12-04 13:45:46 Might have something to do with the fact that Texas employs huge numbers of people in the oil & gas industry. So Sirota maybe lumping individual contributions from these folks to make it seem like it's fossil industry corporate cash. This is a bit manipulative IMHO.
7408 2018-12-04 13:45:43 Ayam waiting for another set of pic,taken at exactly 19:45 let's see what's ur kind of ororo,oil rig oshi.
7409 2018-12-04 13:45:42 Question: How much of an OPEC+ production cut is already priced in? #oil #OOTT
7410 2018-12-04 13:45:34 Yo siento que el aire acondicionado me reseca demasiado la cara...hoy en la mañana me tuve que poner bio oil, que era lo único que tenia. ¿Qué usan ustedes? Ayuuuuda!!
7411 2018-12-04 13:45:23 食パンさんぽやしみ〜
7412 2018-12-04 13:45:16 you can go to Canadian Tire and buy the oil yourself and change the oil in the yard and keep the receipts and it is covered. I was told that by a sales person with GM
7413 2018-12-04 13:45:14 They'll ask the state to protect their monopoly status when state already exists, sure.  If I am sitting on some oil, I have no incentive to create a state. I have an incentive to sell that oil because an abundance of oil is of no particular use to me.
7414 2018-12-04 13:45:09 Im sitting here waiting for my cars oil change to get done and this just killed me

7417 2018-12-04 13:44:51 Hahahaha. Maybe @MthuliNcube reckons a little bit of snake oil from Mnangagwa's scarf might do the trick to jumpstart the comatose economy!
7418 2018-12-04 13:44:47 Hire players? QEB CEO Sanjit Sen has no time for that.He has been buying dozens of bottles of Japani oil to massage Amna tomorrow & ask him whether or not he still has a pain.He would now rub oil on the head of Kasim & ask him how he has got such great hair on his skull.
7419 2018-12-04 13:44:35 Btw roship oil ygcara carrier sama yg trilogy km liat dimana? Butuh review yg bener" meyakinkan takut break out lagi
7420 2018-12-04 13:44:29 Saying "Alberta is forced to move it by train" without any mention of a pipeline and instead comparing it to a nation that uses ships is a bit ridiculous. Hes not only comparing a nation with a province bu also comparing moving oil across land vs across water

7422 2018-12-04 13:44:20 [BREAKING NEWS ALERT](DEVELOPING)Palace: Due consideration was given to several factors including, but not limited to: the downward impact on inflation owing to the steep drop in the Dubai crude oil price, | via @pia_gutierrez
7423 2018-12-04 13:44:16 The price of oil has gone down a bit since then. For comparison it’s $2.30/gal near me.

The system is awash with oil money.

7429 2018-12-04 13:43:54 he's just selling his 'snake oil' in every speech he gives.
7430 2018-12-04 13:43:52 What did your glorious snake oil salesman leader say (Farage) if it was 48% it would be unfinished business?! We now know the facts (not the fantasy & Fraud) - it is a moral duty to put this right. Direct your anger at the con merchants leading the leave campaign.
7431 2018-12-04 13:43:51 PLEASE OIL IT DONT LET IT FALL
7432 2018-12-04 13:43:49 Yes. Scary because what will we all do a&act like when climate impacts hit harder? Macron needed to reshift taxes not just add on.
We need strategy.
Take military out of areas that will be incinerated in the long run&focus on what we can save. Decarbonize faster=less oil imports.
7433 2018-12-04 13:43:46 @ThatGirlShaeXo Do you just use a makeup wipe to remove the shadows when you're doing your swatches on your eyes? I'm watching your @ColourPopCo swatch video & notice how sore your eyes was getting. And thout maybe try a soft cotton ball with an oil based makeup remover.
7434 2018-12-04 13:43:39 The Witcher:
It was a crispy day in Kaer Morhen. Vesemir was teaching new recruits about  Forktails. 'Use  Draconid Oil against them', he said, 'It'll make your jobs easier'.
7435 2018-12-04 13:43:36 The OPEC will meet on December 6th, for the moment that’s how oil prices are:
West Texas  $WTI 53.77(+1.55%).

7438 2018-12-04 13:43:02 Capitalism run amok. Unrestrained greed and all its resulting data driven fallout. When are we going to establish effective regulations - read consumer protections here - on big $$, big pharma, big oil, big $$ i politics. #ruiningdemocracy
7439 2018-12-04 13:42:58 Baby oil and full body massage  me pls
7440 2018-12-04 13:42:55 Even if it's 4 or 5x that number, it's fine.. That magic "every 3000 miles" has been a false standard set by dealerships for years. It's extra money in their pockets for them to change your oil more often than necessary..
7441 2018-12-04 13:42:52 Tea Tree Oil ~ It helps treat dark spots, reduces acne while treating scars, and reduces redness. Dilute it with water bcs it is very strong. Dab it onto any acne and scars. Do this every other night since its very strong.
7442 2018-12-04 13:42:39 [BREAKING NEWS ALERT](DEVELOPING)Palace: The current oil price has gone down to 53 to 52 dollars per barrel hence the legal requirement for the suspension of excise tax on fuel can not be met. | via @pia_gutierrez

7446 2018-12-04 13:42:28 I wonder if they’ll take the same line on oil company subsidies.
7447 2018-12-04 13:42:10 [BREAKING NEWS ALERT](DEVELOPING)Palace: While the oil excise tax increase is a negligible contributor to inflation, we still commit to provide financial assistance to the 50% poorest households. | via @pia_gutierrez

7453 2018-12-04 13:41:26 I called, buddy says they do tire changeovers that are warranty approved but can't tell me if oil changes are. Right on.

7456 2018-12-04 13:41:18 Your inaction and your anti oil panel of the past, along with buying into the carbon scam sure didn’t help!
7457 2018-12-04 13:41:18 @bellewitch66 I was laying in bed before I got up thinking about the advice your friend's vet gave, to give her dog CBD oil to calm it down.
7458 2018-12-04 13:41:11 Ironic that he's sayings this in front of the UN, an international government org funded by the Rockefellers, from their oil empire. What a godamn sham.

7462 2018-12-04 13:40:51 Yes, which is why Climate Change is too important an issue for small minded Bernie surrogates and their solipsistic propaganda.

Because you’re apparently saying any person who works in oil&gas is tainted, so, good luck to Bernie winning West Virginia coal miner’s votes.
7463 2018-12-04 13:40:47 If you ask most politicians the following  costs they have no clue.

Tuition is public school
Consultation at a public hospital 
Coat of electricity 
Cost of water 
Cost of fuel 
Registration form for the university
1kg of rice
1kg of sugar
1kg of meat
1l of oil 
1can of milk
7464 2018-12-04 13:40:35 Witch Hazel ~ Its around $5 at Walmart. It reduces inflammation, heals acne scars, and decreases oil production. Take a cotton pad and a bit of this and wipe your face. Dont forget your neck too. Use this as a toner morning and night.
7465 2018-12-04 13:40:31 (*｀ω´*)ﾄﾞﾔｱｱ
7466 2018-12-04 13:40:21 There was no way he collected the kind of money he collected without large donors
Anyone who is naive enough to think he didn't take large contributions from people down here, well..
Texans are gas and oil for the most part, so the money is going to come from them

7468 2018-12-04 13:40:12 Beard oil just like hair cream is important for moisturizing hair. It helps prevent hair breakage, softening of hair and keeps the hair looking good and healthy, and as a bonus it helps in increasing hair growth

So, you see benefits, benefits, benefits 
PS. It has no side effect

7470 2018-12-04 13:40:01 We aren't looking at oil though... I notice now.

{Shrugs... irrelevant noise.}
7471 2018-12-04 13:39:58 There area lot of oil and gas people in Texas, aren’t there?
7472 2018-12-04 13:39:50 Why should people outside Metropolis (you know, us country bumpkins) who need range and quick refueling subsidize pinky ring clowns who think 5 miles is a "commute"?  Oil and gas supply long range fuel and electricity to charge your batteries.  And at lower cost than "green".
7473 2018-12-04 13:39:43 I’m pretty sure I donated to Sanders in 2016, so how do I go about collecting my refund? Since I work in the oil field I assume the Senator doesn’t want my money.
7474 2018-12-04 13:39:37 The day the world's reliance on oil fades will be a very good day.
7475 2018-12-04 13:39:32 Supporting murderous/ genocidal dictators is not in the United States best interest either. The Republicans are protecting oil corporations, and their donors, over human lives.

7478 2018-12-04 13:39:05 You can and Bernie did. But you can’t top the list of oil and gas donations that way because it is a sector with a small total number of employees, many of whom routinely make very large political contributions.
7479 2018-12-04 13:38:58 It’s Scottish Oil actually, an iScot will have control of all of its waters
7480 2018-12-04 13:38:57 It will be absolutely fine to go over by that tiny amount... Engines today are built with way better materials and tighter tolerances, and are very well-equipped to handle a few extra miles on the oil..

7484 2018-12-04 13:38:33 Turn out the Iranians are in a mighty pickle a this moment with the oil sanctions and the collape in the price of oil.
7485 2018-12-04 13:38:30 The land belongs to Israel.

"And thou shalt command the children of Israel, that they bring thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamp to burn always." Exodus 27:20(KJV)
7486 2018-12-04 13:38:27 In what way is fossil fuel subsidized? Wind and solar are but oil and coal???
7487 2018-12-04 13:38:25 OIL 1H 53.41 is now 20MA support as 5th wave up END is confirming lower. A break below 20MA is bearish correction confirmation. WATCH SCO?
7488 2018-12-04 13:38:25 Wow. Interesting data about oil and Beto. Thought he was grass roots funded. Bernie Sanders needs to shut up and help overthrow all the corruption from GOP.
7489 2018-12-04 13:38:21 @Ocasio2018 thinks oil is a "fossil fuel". Sweetie, oil is not dead dinasaurs.

Smh...
7490 2018-12-04 13:38:15 they confirm coat with motor oil
7491 2018-12-04 13:38:13 The best part is he’s wrong. These are small donors so they come from the oil gas industry as workers and they have to say where they come from. It’s not like Exxon cuts him a huge check.
7492 2018-12-04 13:38:02 What lies? Can you please be specific. This statement is incendiary. It is the lowest form of expression and based entirely on FEELINGS. You call yourself an academic. You are just a snake oil salesman.

7494 2018-12-04 13:37:53 This is a very interesting discussion. I have also at some point noted we also might not need to keep producing cooking oil at higher production costs when   we have other playerd in the region who are way ahead in technology and produce it much more cheaply.
7495 2018-12-04 13:37:40 Did ya know that the Texas economy is built on oil and gas? Sooooo, why is it so confusing to you that our congressional representatives get money from the industry that is one of our economic cornerstones?
7496 2018-12-04 13:37:39 callout post for Mew:

7497 2018-12-04 13:37:36 KSA is nothing without supporting USA, they bought war walfare from America and lifting oil (Aramco) also.
Meanwhile USA is always condemned by indonesian moeslim as a infidel country which killed palestine people.
So this is all about politic and power.
Sorry to say...
7498 2018-12-04 13:37:35 When you put on baby  oil gel thinking that you're ashy and it's really your winter white coming through....smh.
7499 2018-12-04 13:37:30 Thank you! Thank you! David and his bullshit! There is a difference between pacs, corporate and individual donations. One of the dominant industry in Texas is gas and oil. I’m so sick of this crap.
7500 2018-12-04 13:37:22 Your goal was to make it seem like Beto is in the pocket of oil  and gas, even though those donations were probably from individual people.
7501 2018-12-04 13:37:19 Lots of processed #food #snacks now boast "Hi Oleic Sunflower Oil" in the ingredients list. #HighOleic just means it is higher in #monounsaturates,with little(or any?)omega 6 #polyunsaturates. Does such oil reduce #testosterone(like regular w6 sunflower oil)?
7502 2018-12-04 13:37:14 Do you think they like oil?
7503 2018-12-04 13:37:11 Agree!
7504 2018-12-04 13:37:09 Do you really think that someone who works on an oil rig and donates to a campaign is equivalent to a PAC organized by oil companies?

7517 2018-12-04 13:36:07 Should I highlight Reps who receive the majority of their donations from union EMPLOYEES?

I literally don't get your fucking point. Bro received 0.6% of his donations from Oil/Gas employees.

It's literally a non-fucking-issue.
7518 2018-12-04 13:35:52 True, but you don’t become a top recipient relying on $25 donations from mail room clerks. Oil and gas only employs 1.4 million people with a lot of very high salaries. You get to the top with owners and execs maxing out the legal limit which IIRC is $2700.
7519 2018-12-04 13:35:45 Oil EXECUTIVES are NOT employees.
7520 2018-12-04 13:35:39 We need more women on oil rigs, irrespective of the danger to meet the 50% quota!  I am sure diamond mining may also do with extra female employees.

7642 2018-12-04 13:23:03 #BREAKINGNEWSNOW:(DEVELOPING)#PresidentDuterte approves 2nd round of oil excise tax hike in 2019 during Tuesday's Cabinet meeting in Malacañang, Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno confirms. | @NCorralesINQ
7643 2018-12-04 13:23:00 Oil and gas has had a particularly hard time. Unfortunately, if teachers are defeated in this dispute and no steps are taken to deal with wider issues of resourcing, constant curricular change and unfunded inclusion, I think the future of education looks bleak for everyone’s kids
7644 2018-12-04 13:22:52 Opened fb, saw the oil excise tax hike, scrolled a bit, saw the 2nd reading for draft constitution to change to a federal government, and now im done with fb for the day
7645 2018-12-04 13:22:52 the surplus of high-quality oil itself addresses demand  - that's why prices for low-quality bitumen are so low, that's why the pipeline is not and never will be economically feasible.
7646 2018-12-04 13:22:48 Brian let me guess. You are a white collar, work for daddy, and never worked in the oil patch.
7647 2018-12-04 13:22:47 2.) it’s no big deal if I sleep in my makeup 
Your skin ages up to 7 years every time you sleep in your makeup  your skin is most active when asleep so it’s really taking in all the oil, debris and clogging up those pores. Double cleanse before bed!!!
7648 2018-12-04 13:22:44 Oil and gas employs ~1.4 million people, mostly well compensated. Oil rig workers make ~$100k.  Healthcare employs ~18 million who earn an avg of $40k. The implications of high contribution totals from these two sectors are very different. 2/

7653 2018-12-04 13:22:31 @repsheaporter @SenatorShaheen @Senatorhassan: Tell @realDonaldTrump @SecretaryZinke not to risk >1.5 million jobs and ~$108 billion in GDP in the Atlantic for <7 months’ worth of oil and <6 months’ worth of gas. #BlockTheBlast #ProtectOurCoast
7654 2018-12-04 13:22:20 Hope you'll send us wedding IV 2019
7655 2018-12-04 13:22:04 I love seeing the newest concepts of the Super LandWar Anger Fighting Team Crooked Canon. 

The only thing missing is a bunch of former Generals catching the money in their branch snake oil kit.

Blown money still goes somewhere.
7656 2018-12-04 13:21:51 So..... about the oil crisis in Canada
7657 2018-12-04 13:21:40 I'm really really sure that no nig oil companies deducted Beto contributions from employee paychecks.
7658 2018-12-04 13:21:29 Flex on
(Make flex oil next)
7659 2018-12-04 13:21:16 Then buy beard oil. 
7660 2018-12-04 13:21:14 So how about all the oil companies and large retail stores first, clean all the oceans from the plastic mess they created. that would be a start. . .
7661 2018-12-04 13:21:04 Hahahaahhahaha der de3 only car metals n oil sem nkoaaaa ooooo...
7662 2018-12-04 13:20:57 but i would really suggest putting coconut oil thru at least thrice a week so it gets soft and manageable.

7668 2018-12-04 13:19:52 So maybe they should stop oil production all together.  Who needs gas for cars or any kind of plastic.
7669 2018-12-04 13:19:52 @WadayahayaWada Pls forget that man call Bishop Oyedepo just because his Oil Block license is withdrawn, that is the reason behind the useless utterances
7670 2018-12-04 13:19:51 i know lynda i am sick repeating that the oil fields come under The UK Continental Shelf
7671 2018-12-04 13:19:43 Since gutom na ako, oil (minsan butter pina-pang alternate ko para mas healthy hahah saka mas malasa), garlic, onion, salt and pepper lang  HAHAHA nothing special???

7673 2018-12-04 13:19:30 Don't forget decomposing leaves and volcano belches.  These give off FAR more CO2 than human activity.  Kind of hard to stop the leaves from falling...
7674 2018-12-04 13:19:24 Omo I’ve been smelling delicious since early morning. Coconut oil on my skin + Axe Gold Temptation body spray + Franck Olivier oud vanille. I’mma do this throughout this month. Will switch it up to that Hugo Boss bottled oud in January (my birth month). I love smelling good jor.

7678 2018-12-04 13:19:10 oh!イル
7679 2018-12-04 13:19:05 Yes, it is disingenuous to frame it to look like oil companies directly donate to campaign... especially when this data shows individual donors’ contributions. That’s the point.
7680 2018-12-04 13:18:53 Get some CBD oil Kate. I couldn't sleep for months and even had a panic attack at night, then I got CBD oil and slept soundly the first night after my first dose. It's amazing stuff with no side effects, and completely natural. You don't need these kind of nights anymore

7691 2018-12-04 13:17:30 Would add oil as a strong element.
7692 2018-12-04 13:17:25 อหหห เค้าหอมกันอีกแล้ว
7693 2018-12-04 13:17:22 Dito ninyo makikita ang pagiging suapang ni Duterte. Sa kabila ng kahirapan, ipagpatuloy pa rin nila ang pag taas ng fuel sa January 1, 2019. Bakit na lang hindi nila abolish ang pork barrel ng mambabatas na nagkakahalaga ng P53 billion sa budget ng 2019 sa halip na  oil
7694 2018-12-04 13:17:18 I just finished watching 'The Man who knew Infinity' and I would like to express some of my thoughts. 
Ramanujan was, obviously, a genius. He worked so hard on his own, sat under oil lamps and candles. He was SO passionate about his work. But he could not win against his fate.
7695 2018-12-04 13:17:17 Reduced dependence on foreign oil reduces US exposure to 1,500 years Middle East religious wars.
7696 2018-12-04 13:17:03 That was my impression too! She processed the surplus (avocado  )into oil...bold initiative&good luck to her.
7697 2018-12-04 13:17:02 Would be a better argument if they were not subsidizing oil and gas...  or corn...

7706 2018-12-04 13:16:05 Here we go again with this nonsense about “oil and gas” money. These are donations from individuals who work for that industry in some capacity, which happens to be huge in Texas.
7707 2018-12-04 13:16:04 An oil tanker doesn't change the course immediately, it takes time. In the meanwhile thank you for being the engine of change.
7708 2018-12-04 13:15:59 Squad sized and also use non sustainable palm oil. No thanks.

7710 2018-12-04 13:15:48 1) Would scots be better off with 100% of oil revenues or the 8% we get from WM?

2) Do you think scots are wrong to want to run thier own country?
I look forward to you running away again.

7712 2018-12-04 13:15:44 Yeah sell the oil skippy. You and your lying ilk have just a few weeks left. When you go, then we can start rolling on Pakistan.
7713 2018-12-04 13:15:41 If Ontario adopts the national GHG reduction target, Canada is guaranteed to miss our national target. We in Ontario need to do more, in part to offset rising emissions from Alberta and Saskatchewan oil production. Welcome to federalism. #cdnpoli #onpoli

7715 2018-12-04 13:15:29 RW: --Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, was trading up 2% at $62.93 a barrel on Londons Intercontinental Exchange.
7716 2018-12-04 13:15:21 The best food I had in #Amsterdam was Middle Eastern food places (in general), followed by one Asian place, Walk to Wok (but it made me sick, too much cooking oil for me). Italian, no, hell no. Argentinean, just ok. I basically stuck with Middle Eastern food most of the time.

7722 2018-12-04 13:14:05 @kelemenCari  Nothing to do with Big Oil. High prices in my hometown are caused by being at the end of the distribution line.
7723 2018-12-04 13:13:55 I got bought beard shampoo and beard balm and I have beard oil somewhere. Tbf the beard oils smells better than what I ate last.

7731 2018-12-04 13:13:05 I’m sure they don’t want oil prices running too much before the meeting.  Other wise the argument about weak prices won’t be as strong.

7745 2018-12-04 13:12:00 Brent crude oil prices reached a high of $85 a barrel on October 9, 2018. Since then, they have fallen to about $60 a barrel. This is a 29 per cent drop in about two months. Petrol prices fell by just 12 per cent and those of diesel were down by 9 per cent in the same period.

7765 2018-12-04 13:10:23 So you are an environmentalist who wants to see the economy tank.  We need the oil pipelines to get money to help improve the economy.  Then they can invest in green energy.

7769 2018-12-04 13:10:03 You think they haven’t already done this? And no, the world is not moving to renewables anytime soon. There is nothing in renewables that is ready to replace oil, for many decades to come.

7777 2018-12-04 13:09:15 France just proves what we already know. The human race will not act on Climate Change until it is too late. Half the planet will have to starve before we ever ween ourselves off of oil.

7781 2018-12-04 13:08:49 I agree, corporate money influencing politics is seriously dangerous. It’s quite telling how quickly you jumped up to defend taking donations from an industry as problematic as big oil.

Do you want something else or I should stop ?
7789 2018-12-04 13:08:03 Cut oil production=jobs cut. Nothing being done.
7790 2018-12-04 13:08:00 There was no European Union to pull and share resources. Funny how living standards in the UK took a sharp upturn in the late 70's, you know.... when oil was discovered and we entered the European Union.

7796 2018-12-04 13:07:32 Those appear to be states with a large number of oil/gas jobs. Oil/gas jobs often come with relatively high salaries. Could this list of names simply reflect candidates in high-turnout elections in oil/gas states?

7802 2018-12-04 13:06:30 Rupee ended weaker against the US Dollar, as persistent rise in crude oil prices dampened investors sentiment. Trade volumes were low ahead of RBI policy outcome scheduled tomorrow and OPEC meet on Thursday. The Rupee ended at 70.51 vs. previous close of 70.46.
7803 2018-12-04 13:06:29 Was burning the midnight oil looking for flights under $600, no joy. Even looked at TPA to Vegas
7804 2018-12-04 13:06:28 Your argument is false. The reason the oil is flowing further is b/c of greater coking capacity and greater demand in the Gulf. Building Keystone XL was part of this plan.  If you get it to coastal water refineries you will also realize the higher glob Brent crude price.

7806 2018-12-04 13:06:19 Government bond prices ended higher today as crude oil prices recover from their intraday high in Asian trade. In addition, the fall in US Treasury yields supported the bond prices. Investors were cautious ahead of the outcome of RBI’s monetary policy meeting, scheduled tomorrow.

7810 2018-12-04 13:06:00 Oil this week surged the most in over 5 months as Saudi Arabia & Russia extended a cooperation pact & U.S.-China trade tensions cooled. Unprecedented supply cuts in Canada,also drove prices higher.

7812 2018-12-04 13:05:51 This has already been covered. 

Many of the donors we're  wealthy oil people that channelled their money through the system.

And even if they weren't all wealthy climate change is still a reality and still needs to be dealt with and we simply cannot take a gamble on this.
7813 2018-12-04 13:05:44 Agreed! that is why I also suggested good quality oil. Most essential oils sold in stores are cut with other oils/perfume and can be harmful to humans too. Lavender is good,but that is why i also sugguest diffusing first. Just to make sure it is well received.1 drop will do 
7814 2018-12-04 13:05:30 Same, girl. Try smelling some lavender or menthol oil, it helps me a bit during pesky attacks.

7839 2018-12-04 13:03:30 RBI policy meet (3-5-December-2018):     We expect the December 2018 MPC to vote for a hold with a “calibrated     tightening” stance, prompted by continued low food inflation, sharp fall in     oil prices and a lower than expected growth trajectory.
7840 2018-12-04 13:03:24 We need a green economy. The subsidies for oil and coal?  Continue
7841 2018-12-04 13:03:12 In the week ahead, the main focus will likely to be on the     OPEC meeting (5-6-December-2018) to see whether there will be cuts in crude     oil production that could in turn influence the crude oil price trajectory.

7846 2018-12-04 13:02:39 You look it up. Also let’s look the industries that donate to Bernie. Beto lives in Texas and one of tge biggest employers are the oil amd gas industry. Bernie won’t go anywhere because black women won’t vote for him in the primary. So good luck smearing Beto to help Bernie win.
7847 2018-12-04 13:02:33 Changed my oil last night . Lol  got kinda cold
7848 2018-12-04 13:02:13 Are you arguing the Oil/Gas Industry employees in Texas shouldn't be able to support politicians?

These are two VASTLY different situations, which is my point.

Bernie took NRA lobbyist money. Beto took money from INDIVIDUAL Texans working in the Oil/Gas Industry.

7854 2018-12-04 13:01:34 Considering Beto ran in TX where a large population of the people working in the oil / gas industry, so why is it surprising that so many INDIVIDUALS donated to his campaign. He did not take corporate PAC money. How much money has Bernie received from members of the NRA?
7855 2018-12-04 13:01:25 The international energy agency says carbon emissions from advanced economies set to rise for the first time in five years in 2018. Says higher use of oil and gas more than made up for declining use of coal worldwide.

7887 2018-12-04 12:58:10 Working from home today. Just came downstairs to find the cat has knocked over and smashed a big bottle of olive oil. I might just close the door and pretend I knew nothing about it. What a mess
7888 2018-12-04 12:58:09 nope not at all, oil was just so obviously a superior, cheaper, and hugely more efficient solution to literally evryone. Wind turbines, biofuels, and solar panels - are not that
7889 2018-12-04 12:58:08 The man is loosing the focus, just because of the withdraw of his oil block licence which they informed all the stakeholder to re-apply.
7890 2018-12-04 12:57:57 Mr. Kenney, I suspect that this has more to do with business than government. Business makes more money when they get cheap oil than when they have to pay a fair price for oil. #ableg #oilprice

‘You are a winner’
‘Your case is different’

7910 2018-12-04 12:55:30 Absolutely I'm asking "whatabout" here.

If Bernie receiving LOBBYIST money from NRA killers is ok with you, then Beto receiving INDIVIDUAL money from Oil/Gas employees in TEXAS should be a no brainer.

I mean...sure...What About Consistency? 
7911 2018-12-04 12:55:27 Bacon medallions.  No fat. Eggs in fry light which isn't a fatty oil x
7912 2018-12-04 12:55:21 Your response explains a lot why we are in the mess we are currently in. Have you checked your facts? Did he receive money from big oil or people who work in that industry? It is Texas after all. Many people work in the oil and gas industry. Don’t they count?
7913 2018-12-04 12:55:19 His Excellency President Buhari is not interested in owning Oil blocks neither is he interested in growing his personal wealth. Having listened to his Excellency speak, and having spoke to him many times, he only voice how to grow Nigeria  and Nigerians. All he think is Nigeria

7922 2018-12-04 12:54:08 And the media is trying to push the idea that all this is over oil/gas prices??   When they, like all of Europe are being invaded by illegal immigrants!  Media is BullSh*t.
7923 2018-12-04 12:54:01 Buck up buttercup. The Bern wave is coming & y'all can't stop the US' most popular politician 3 years running this time. We're ready for ya.

You know what no one can afford? Another milqetoast Centrist in bed w oil & gas. The planet is burning, ICYMI.
7924 2018-12-04 12:53:47 Please buy my essential oil infused, tea lined wraps that will make you lose 16 lbs in 2 weeks and make your smile whiter... I strongly dislike pyramid schemes
7925 2018-12-04 12:53:40 Taking donations from oil money in Texas (because oil) is equivalent to taking NRA money in Vermont (because deer hunting).

7928 2018-12-04 12:53:14 Go to any pharmacy. Ask for eucalyptus oil. 
Add a few drops into a bowl of steaming hot water and inhale, with a towel draped over your head to capture the steam
7929 2018-12-04 12:53:03 Which essential oil gets rid of my micromanaging habit?
7930 2018-12-04 12:52:59 3,000 miles over for a oil change. Knows they are working on my car because of the white paint on the tires.
7931 2018-12-04 12:52:55 So this means oil workers and folks that worked for oil companies gave him personal donations.  

In a State where the oil industry is the largest business. 

What a surprise...
7932 2018-12-04 12:52:54 @bobbybonesshow  fermented cod liver oil on a daily basis will knock out any cold.  I recommend green pastures fermented cod liver oil.
7933 2018-12-04 12:52:48 What’s to believe or not to believe? The distraction of the “miracle of oil” or the real thing which is the victory of Maccabees over the Assyrians nearly 550 BCE.

7939 2018-12-04 12:52:18 He represents a oil and gas state.....I’m pretty sure that’s the reason for the contribution. It kinda drive the economy here in Texas for the moment
7940 2018-12-04 12:52:18 Total self own David.... you just proved that 
@BetoORourke
 did amazingly among TX Oil and Gas WORKERS as a Dem. 

Much better than Bernie ever did.  

Imagine that in WV with coal and Ohio and and PA. 

You are like Ted Cruz every attack only makes Beto look better!!
7941 2018-12-04 12:52:06 Like oil and water
That will never mix

My heart will never try
To love again just to cry
7942 2018-12-04 12:52:06 Some valuable #Hannukah  history facts:

* The Greeks were defeated many years after the oil miracle

* The Macabees were never fully sovereign

* They were a puppet state under the Romans

* The war against the Greeks was to repel religious persecution not to attain sovereignty
7943 2018-12-04 12:51:52 Just had a curious latte which involved a shot of coconut oil and cinnamon. I can feel the judging eyes of @jhallwood.
7944 2018-12-04 12:51:46 Lol no she didn't. She tried justifying his big oil cash but ended pointing out how much Wall Street cash he took instead.

7950 2018-12-04 12:50:59 Ndo. Have you tried using Eucalyptus oil. 
I'm not a fan of pepper at all
7951 2018-12-04 12:50:55 So he got bullied by the oil overlords' minions. They will suffocate any attempt on clean energy with all they have.
7952 2018-12-04 12:50:47 Oil and the cheap energy it brought was biggest reason for increase of living standards for all and every thing else that came with that in the 20th century. Would you have preferred we stayed on coal and wood? if we can come up with a better solution than oil, I'm all for it.
7953 2018-12-04 12:50:41 The essence of the Chanukah holiday is spreading word of the ancient miracle (that a single days’ oil supply miraculously lasted for 8 until the Temple could be re-consecrated). Hence you’ll find Jews lighting candles and sharing the miracle in as public a fashion as possible.
7954 2018-12-04 12:50:34 Quick oil change n I’m on the road on go

7958 2018-12-04 12:50:23 My accent has 260,000 miles on it, hasn’t had an oil change in six months, hasn’t ran in the same amount of time and started right up like nothing ever happened. I’m probably gonna trade my Jeep in and get a new Hyundai.
7959 2018-12-04 12:50:14 You are not a nut.  Every home I ever moved into, except brand new, all walls were washed.  Periodically the walls in current home are washed. One would be surprised the dirt, oil & general crud is found when giving walls a good scrub.
7960 2018-12-04 12:50:08 NY #11 is moving sideways despite the surge in crude oil by as market is still digesting the build-up in India and Thailand’s stocks in 2018/19, which supports their pace of exports in the upcoming months, despite prospects of lower-than-expected output in 2018/19.

7963 2018-12-04 12:49:30 I wonder if any of them realized going in that after this brief time if Trump being President the country would go in completely opposite direction when he is out. In a couple if yrs the U.S. will start cutting oil subsidies completely.
7964 2018-12-04 12:49:28 not as much as having the rapist, the murderer and the idiot and his wife, you know the guy how tried building the economy brewing beer, using up our oil reserves and legalizing pot? Still waiting to see the tax windfall from that last one.

7969 2018-12-04 12:49:03 I ask this with all humility that I know nothing of French politics - given that gas tax was the issue, has anyone investigated whether Big Oil is funding yellow jacket movement?
7970 2018-12-04 12:48:59 Unscrew the oil filler cap. If there's white gunk on the underside, that's evidence of water leaking from the gasket. Also abnormally high engine temp & having to refill radiator more often than normal.
7971 2018-12-04 12:48:35 Or we could give them CBD oil which is completely natural and requires absolutely no surgery. Oh, wait, that doesn’t make BigPharma even bigger so of course that’s not a solution.
7972 2018-12-04 12:48:22 *pours coconut oil over entire life*
7973 2018-12-04 12:48:20 Yes! You can be on TV, and write for Bloomberg, Forbes, the WSJ, and be a lobbyist for the shale oil industry. Just don't buck the "trend,"  talk up big production numbers, ignore real reserves, debt and profitability and you too can become an oil "analyst."  Its quite the rage!
7974 2018-12-04 12:48:16 And we're still not voting for that milquetoast centrist who is soaked in oil money.

7977 2018-12-04 12:47:56 Just maintaining standards.

If Beto receiving individual contributions from the Oil/Gas Industry that amount to 0.5% of his total donations running in Texas, then Bernie receiving DIRECT contributions from NRA lobbyists is surely MUCH worse, no?

7982 2018-12-04 12:47:14 My wife is a member of the ATA. Her and her colleagues laugh at the union. It’s actually been “strongly” suggested that the NDP will do the most for teachers. Idiotic notion considering we’re in Alberta. More than half of her colleagues spouses rely on oil and gas for a living.
7983 2018-12-04 12:47:03 fresh naman sana oil
7984 2018-12-04 12:46:51 True. Europe will keep buying Iranian oil while refusing to meet NATO commitments to self-defense. Meanwhile they will complain about Russian militarization and how the US is “leaving the world stage”.
7985 2018-12-04 12:46:46 U.S. oil futures +2.4% ahead of a crucial meeting between Saudi Arabia-led OPEC & Russia later this week. Investors now expecting the oil producing countries to cooperate on production cuts.

7990 2018-12-04 12:46:21 Unfortunately, arm sales to Gulf States will not rescind, it is the only way to negate perceived trade imbalance due to billions paid to them for oil.

7992 2018-12-04 12:46:17 The tarsands are a small fraction of the economy and they were in decline well before Trudeau. The oil simply isn't worth it for producers anymore. No government can fix that.

7994 2018-12-04 12:46:05 Read the thread- not big money from companies, little money from individual employees. And yeah, a lot of Texans work in the oil industry.
7995 2018-12-04 12:46:03 So the fact that so many Oil & workers in TX (of which there are a lot David) donated to a Dem is actually eye opening and should be scary to Repubs and actually HELP Betos case ... thanks David.

8026 2018-12-04 12:42:03 I've been in that situation for 10 years.
For 2 or 3 winters, we could not afford heating oil, so had no heating or hot water. Two of those winters were the coldest for a long time, with temperatures -10 degrees C & sometimes lower, for many weeks.

8054 2018-12-04 12:39:53 Panelo: The current oil price has gone down to $53 to $52 per barrel hence the legal requirement for the suspension of excise tax on fuel can not be met @TheManilaTimes

But when leadership changes 2 being less moral, or having an attitude of pride over such assets & wealth, as if they can do NEthing they want cause they can control who gets what of their oil, those MORAL rules R being broken, & thats a PROBLEM!

8066 2018-12-04 12:38:19 I don't believe in letting the masses vote though. I think it makes no sense for people who can be bought over with rice and palm oil to be voting. I'd prefer electoral colleges.
8067 2018-12-04 12:38:14 My guess is that most of the reduction will come from reducing the % of carbonintensive products in their portfolio.  So less oil, more gas and more renewable electricity. Would be good if they also commit to taking some of the CO2 back for which their products are responsible.

8070 2018-12-04 12:37:59 I agree. You should run someone who will cozy up to the oil industry and block any meaningful progressive legislation.
8071 2018-12-04 12:37:55 It is preferable to light the Hanukah candles with olive oil. While any olive oil is perfectly acceptable, some Halachic authorities maintain that it is preferable to use edible olive oil.

8085 2018-12-04 12:36:19 It is preferable to use olive oil for lighting Hanukah candles, because the Menorah in the Bet Ha’mikdash was kindled with olive oil. Since our lighting commemorates the miracle of the Menorah in the Bet Ha’mikdash, it is preferable to use olive oil.

8105 2018-12-04 12:33:54 In other words, your trying to discredit the other 99.5% of his donors b/c 0.5% were employed by the Oil/Gas Industry?

I mean...I donated $250 to Beto, which his significantly higher than the Oil/Gas Industry employee average.

Why don't we do a hit job on Tim donating to Beto?
8106 2018-12-04 12:33:42 Who wouldn't do the olive oil thing.
8107 2018-12-04 12:33:35 True.
Unless Trump renounces Iran Sanction Waivers very soon, oil prices are going to tumble lower.
8108 2018-12-04 12:33:33 Didn't him promise job for the unemploy? How is the oil sector today? What is the state of the national now 
Nigeria is an hunger nation now. Was reduction of dollar not promised?  Was monthly payment of 5000 naira to unemploy youth not promised?
8109 2018-12-04 12:33:15 This is just the tip of the iceberg from claiming to be phasing out the oil sands to a carbon tax that has been studied many times to be detrimental to the oil sector to a speech where he mentioned every province except Alberta.

8120 2018-12-04 12:31:51 Perhaps his legacy isn't as squeeky clean as people would like to believe. Nobody seems to remember that he and his family bought political influence from their big oil profits. Further, the CIA business of regime change in Central and South America continued while Bush was  DCI.

Of the $70 million Beto raised, what PERCENTAGE of that came from the Oil/Gas Industry?

This isn't a challenging question.

8182 2018-12-04 12:24:41 So because he supports Sanders, he can’t factually attack someone who takes oil/gas money? I thought your a progressive. Make sense now why O’Rourke didn’t go full on attacking Cruz toward the end if the campaign. Also didn’t support medicare for all. These are accurate critiques
8183 2018-12-04 12:24:40 Jaja, oil & water mixed, very bad future waiting behind the door.
8184 2018-12-04 12:24:02 Panelo:  While the oil excise tax increase is a negligible contributor to inflation, we still commit to provide financial assistance to the 50% poorest households @manilabulletin

8186 2018-12-04 12:23:54 Maybe that they should start with corporations first - doesn't the French oil and gas sector still receive indirect subsidies?
8187 2018-12-04 12:23:53 Must oil marketers threaten strike and shut down of depots when Christmas festivities arrival?  Or in a bid to extort travelers and holidayers. This has to be stopped. Last year fuel sold as high as #400 per litre and mustn't repeat this year.

8193 2018-12-04 12:23:39 Panelo: The current oil price has gone down to 53 to 52 dollars per barrel hence the legal requirement for the suspension of excise tax on fuel can not be met @manilabulletin
8194 2018-12-04 12:23:35 till then people who've seen pouvoir d'achat fall for last decade have got to eat increase in oil price & tax? Nah. Needs "shit the world is ending" government programs
8195 2018-12-04 12:23:28 Sirota’s tweet suggests Beto takes money from the “oil and gas industry”.

In reality, Beto didn’t take money from that industry or any other.

He took only small-dollar donations from individuals - who are required to list the industry they work in.

8196 2018-12-04 12:23:22 I wasn't talking about oil. Shetland voted No to independence and doesn't what to be dragged out of the UK against it's will. It could have it's own Parliament with devolved powers on income tax etc. Powers like defence and Foreign affairs are reserved to UK...... Oh... wait
8197 2018-12-04 12:23:07 Panelo says due consideration was given to several factors including the downward impact on inflation owing to the steep drop in the Dubai crude oil price, the disruption in the BBB infrastructure program, and reduction in budget @manilabulletin
8198 2018-12-04 12:23:05 Read all of them.

Now answer my question. Out of the $70 million he raised from individual donors, what percentage came from Oil/Gas Industry employees?
8199 2018-12-04 12:22:57 What a garbage article highlighting a nonexisting issue.  Women have the freedom of choice and they chose not to get a job in the oil industry.  Stop virtue signaling and playing with identity politics.

8203 2018-12-04 12:22:51 To be less snarky it's because centrists are fundamentally OK with the status quo. They're okay with a president who brags about making the US the biggest oil producer when climate change is going to kill hundreds of millions of people in the coming decades. 1/

8213 2018-12-04 12:20:51 I realise that oil and gas have faced really hard times and you have my genuine sympathy. I would class your pay freezes and changes to T&Cs as a cut. However, it doesn’t mean my profession can’t seek to stand up for ourselves. I hope times get better for you soon.

You go ahead and tell me which percentage of that came from Oil/Gas Industry employees.

8235 2018-12-04 12:18:12 Yeah but open borders so it’s worth it. There has to be a trade off. On the plus side- the burning cars and tires will keep French people warm this winter since they can’t afford oil heat.
8236 2018-12-04 12:18:12 Mercator Ltd has 12 logistics ships , other 9 ships related to Dredging business is being demerged & to be listed . Taken mines in Indonesia & production  revamped . It now owns coal mines , own jetty to load ships & own ship .

8237 2018-12-04 12:17:55 For that to be possible, he’d have to have run in a very populous state, in a highly contested race, with a lot of media coverage, where gas & oil had significant holdings & some wealthy people would have to think that Cruz was bad at his job or industry regulation was needed.

8258 2018-12-04 12:16:04 I'm surprised anyone would suggest believing and respecting Ian Wood after his comments in 2014 about oil running out. He clearly misinformed and I suspect he is doing the same on #Brexit - not even Mervyn King ex BofE thinks it is.

Hard to say if bottom is in but events of last weekend (US-China truce and Russian-Saudi deal) give us chance to think so. Last wildcard is coming OPEC meeting but I do not expect big surprises.
8309 2018-12-04 12:10:53 Yeah right .  The WP fails to mention the French voted for what we call Democratic Socialism. What they have learned is Democratic & Socialism can’t be in the same sentence, because it’s like water and oil, they don’t mix.

8313 2018-12-04 12:10:38 I just got an oil change in October now 2 months later it’s time again  putting too many miles on my car

8318 2018-12-04 12:10:08 Oh, I can explain it. Bernie met with a couple of his buddies and now they're out spreading half-truths to damage Beto O'Rourke. They know the donations came from people who work in the oil industry, NOT the oil companies themselves - But the truth doesn't help Bernie, so...
8319 2018-12-04 12:10:04 Can't and won't happen. Saudi too oil rich to ditch.
8320 2018-12-04 12:10:04 Just had two orders of deep fried chilli oil chicken skin out of a plastic bag. About an 89% chance I’ll be up more then once tonight.

8329 2018-12-04 12:08:38 How do you intend to solve the issue of unemployment and also to make Akwaibomites benefit maximally from their oil and gas? 

I've been following you sir!
8330 2018-12-04 12:08:15 Just old and realistic. What is your solution? Do you think not accepting oil and gas money makes anything better?
8331 2018-12-04 12:08:14 The US administration thought they can bring Iran oil export to zero...not knowing that Iran is a powerful country
8332 2018-12-04 12:08:09 USA and oil. Because USA an energy exporter actually benefits (as a country) from higher oil price and more importantly many many trump supporters are on the shale gas production states. So if oil goes up say 10$ there will be very little pressure from trump on OPEC Russia etc
8333 2018-12-04 12:08:05 And they r testing for oil off the coast of S.C.

8369 2018-12-04 12:03:11 Just add ‘Olive Oil mein banana’ in the end for some consolation to the mind ! 
8370 2018-12-04 12:03:03 Yeah, no. Beto pulled in $70 million. His take from Oil and Gas Employees was $429K (0.613% of all funds raised). He ran in Texas. That literally makes all the sense in the world.

8446 2018-12-04 11:55:49 Lol bros while I agree with you on this, the nepotistic actions of our leaders started way back before oil was discovered.
E.g, the criteria for admission of Northern officers which was far below standard was a cause for tension even before the first coup. Did we have oil then?

8455 2018-12-04 11:54:50 Think it'd probably be OK if you poured a layer of oil over it to keep it fresh every time you'd used a few spoons...
8456 2018-12-04 11:54:40 He's lining the pockets of the dirty oil industry.  His donors, in other words, and his Master, Vladimir Putin.  I really believe we have enough people with enough $$ and intelligence to bring us back to the future. No doubt, it will take time.

8460 2018-12-04 11:54:14 Lead by example? Claiming to be green yet wanting to build an economy exporting oil? 
8461 2018-12-04 11:54:07 Oil prices go down then they go up. In a few weeks the same reporters and others who asked me about low prices recently will be asking about high prices.

8473 2018-12-04 11:52:25 The question is, why is the taxpayer subsidizing a multi-trillion dollar profit-making industry? Especially when a percentage of crude oil used in the US comes from foreign nations??
8474 2018-12-04 11:52:25 Here is a thought @simonahac - Perhaps the issue with emissions isn’t the fossils being slowly converted to oil and then burned - it’s the fossils running our country and fighting the facts about #climatechange #rwnjs #Auspol

Come on @davidsirota .....all you're doing is alienating the region.
8481 2018-12-04 11:51:17 Mind boggling that Canada imports oil from Saudi Arabia(shipped by tanker) yet Alberta is forced to move its oil by rail!  Messed up?  You bet. ~ Randall's Rant @1061chez
8482 2018-12-04 11:51:10 Where are you even located? If countries developed their own renewable security then the whole oil control rubbish is null and void. Write a book of fiction. Your imagination could be put to better use.
8483 2018-12-04 11:50:58 Who mentioned a Scotsman? In the same way as folk spoke about Saudi Arabia discovering oil, Nigeria etc. It doesn't negate the point that the UKgov pissed it away on nothing whilst Scots got nothing from it
8484 2018-12-04 11:50:55 It's because all of his rich buddies are in coal and oil.  People who actually believe renewable energy is the way of the future will never get through to people that don't believe climate change is real.  I'm going with generational gap on his thinking.

8498 2018-12-04 11:49:32 It’s fun though. Plus he does get the oil dollars but as he’s a Texan wouldn’t expect him to be getting anything else.

8618 2018-12-04 11:38:07 2/2(4) Similarly, people in oil & gas are saying things are moving, and fast. If by next year, there are hard stats showing an increase in the tax net, higher foreign investment, a continuation in the current upward trend in exports, preaching economic theory will seem redundant.

Try two and if Trump's Iran oil sanctions would have been implemented US fuel prices would be the highest in many years- and right at the exact time of the year fuel prices traditionally fall slightly due to less demand and winter blend point is Trump didn't no that

8742 2018-12-04 11:25:57 Nobody is saying these donations shouldn't be discussed. It's the misleading way you portrayed the information that people have a problem with. Your initial post wasn't about large sum donors from oil/gas industry but total donations received.

8746 2018-12-04 11:25:02 UK used Oil revenues to build infrastructure and invest in London to the detriment of rest of U.K.  it was used to fund massive levels of unemployment when Thatcher shut down the industries.  It was used to build the M25 ring road etc.  In short it was used to implement

8752 2018-12-04 11:24:12 Yes, this is just another way to subsidize the oil industry, and it doesn't matter who is in power. Trudeau has promised to end fossil fuel subsidies but hasn't. Instead they poured more money into it by buying a pipeline.

8828 2018-12-04 11:14:58 That number almost certainly *PRIMARILY* consists of donations from such individual oil + gas workers, given that Beto took $0 from PACs

8832 2018-12-04 11:14:33 you say you want legislation to address environmental issues, so you should have no qualms regarding proper regulation of the energy sector
but the fact that you bemoan any opposition to the oil industry gives me no reason to believe you are sincere in that wish

8834 2018-12-04 11:14:11 I'm genuinely trying to figure out what principles Dems have. 

Donations from workers in oil industry is good.

Donations from oil corporations is bad.

Bragging about oil/gas production while the world is on fire, also a good?

If so, why would donations from oil corp. be bad?

8874 2018-12-04 11:07:47 I think a whisk and an oil sump draining siphon would be more appropriate tools to use.

8879 2018-12-04 11:07:36 Oil Pares Gains as Saudi Minister Says OPEC+ Yet to Agree on Cut
8880 2018-12-04 11:07:29 Crude oil $WTIC $CL hit $54.55 $CL_f, now we see if any pullback for perhaps a day or so. And if so, preferably stays above $51.47 area.  Not saying it must pull back, just that on a short-term basis that would be a reasonable potential.
8881 2018-12-04 11:07:18 Bush said he joined CIA as director in 1976. (He lied)

CIA Bay of Pigs op was 'operation Zapata' (Bush's oil company) 1961

8884 2018-12-04 11:07:02 Repo rate cut by 0.25% is expected as below expectation inflation, lower GDP growth and easing of oil prices give room to RBI to reduce the rate.
8885 2018-12-04 11:07:02 I wish people who are criticizing PM Abiy's Foreign and Economic policies realize that he inherited an absolute mess.

8907 2018-12-04 11:04:39 Demanding land is treading on ‘holy ground’

They want land for Gold, Diamonds, Oil, Agriculture

And you want to build a house on top of these resources

They’re won’t allow it!
8908 2018-12-04 11:04:38 Hi there, the palm oil we use is RSPO certified meaning it comes from a sustainable source. It’s necessary to use it for the texture of the nougat in the snack bars. Unfortunately there isn’t an ingredient we can replace it with without changing the product significantly. 
8909 2018-12-04 11:04:30 Then you could reflect on the fact that UK used oil taxation revenue to lower personal and corporation taxes to encourage consumer spending and business investment; Norway chose to keep taxes high and horde the profits of oil extraction.
8910 2018-12-04 11:03:59 Additionally, Canada, one fo the world’s largest oil producers supplying more than 4.2mmbbl per day, is forcing producers to cut output by 8.7% or 325,000bpd until excess crude in storage is reduced
8911 2018-12-04 11:03:53 Same. Other than I've read that the oil industry think its way too onerous but I take that with their obvious bias in mind.
8912 2018-12-04 11:03:49 @CTVNationalNews What kind of cognitive dissonance allows your program to open with a lengthy segment on Alberta's oil industry w/o ever mentioning climate change, then a separate segment on the dire climate warnings from Poland? We must include climate in EVERY report on oil.

8914 2018-12-04 11:03:43 This is of course the way to go. No question about that. BUT, I live in Sweden, where we may be a bit backward in some respects - I cannot find any products n the shops that say RSPO on the wrappers. They just say Palm Oil. Something is missing here!
8915 2018-12-04 11:03:42 Instead of depending in an unpredictable market for our economy to thrive, we should put more to diversification. The oil market should not define our economy. We can't afford to be in recession again. It will cripple us completely.
8916 2018-12-04 11:03:39 Does it mean that Food Companies will pay more than Oil Companies???
8917 2018-12-04 11:03:35 Then you could reflect on the fact that at the time UK was suffering from problems with many nationalized industries and so a nationalized oil industry was not a viable prospect; Norway's oil companies were state-owned and so profits went into oil fund, not just taxation.

8929 2018-12-04 11:02:15 Well, you could always start with the geological conditions of the North Sea and reflect that Norway had a huge advantage in that its extraction and transportation costs were considerably lower than that of the UK, making oil extraction more profitable.

9235 2018-12-04 10:20:45 From my experience working at Ofgem, indeed this is a problem, but once again it has to do mainly with retail markets that are not functioning well enough, e.g. due to lack of competition. If the global oil price drops, you see quickly a reduction at the gasoline station too.

9276 2018-12-04 10:14:11 Oil is a thing of the past. There is nothing that is even comparable to clean energy at this point in history! America needs to get away from oil ASAP. Do you agree majority of Americans want this but are not aware that America is heading in the other direction?
9277 2018-12-04 10:14:09 It’s insane! The oil lobby owns the entire @GOP. And the rest of the world are paying the price. I can’t express my rage against your current administration.

9283 2018-12-04 10:12:53 These oil/gas “industry” contributions are literally EMPLOYEES who donated their own hard-earned money to Beto’s campaign. This stupid chart is deliberately misleading.
9284 2018-12-04 10:12:47 Hi Grega, do u think oil will close it's gap first like eurusd did?
9285 2018-12-04 10:12:12 GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States will not be able to stop Iran exporting its oil and any move to prevent Iranian crude shipments passing through the Gulf would lead to all oil exports through the waterway being blocked, Iran’s president said on Tuesday.

9290 2018-12-04 10:11:51 Selling less for more at least has one upside: stable, and relatively high, oil prices gives MinFin and Russian Central Bank way more room to breathe.

9320 2018-12-04 10:07:57 Yes old installations are being decommissioned. At the same time, new ones are being developed & brought online. The oil reserves are no where near end of life, not even close. I’m sure the work & jobs  the decommissioning is going bring will me welcomed.

9324 2018-12-04 10:07:07 Right or wrong, Qatar pulling out of the opec deal will crash the deal. Iran will produce more. Excess crude oil in the market will crash the price which is what opec is controlling, Low output, high price. 
Basic rule of demand and supply.

9327 2018-12-04 10:06:48 Well, it's the elasticity curve - at what point does it become more profitable selling more for less, or selling less for more? Not sure if Russia will forego any money automatically but the only party guaranteed to benefit from any oil cut is the US shale producers.
9328 2018-12-04 10:06:47 Fish, fishing and oil are all interchangeable words for this man. The trouble with these people is that after all the lies in 2014 no one believes a word from them anymore. Everything they said has been disproved.

9330 2018-12-04 10:06:36 I agree Soraya, about how the geopolitics is complicated, but please understand that oil is the life blood of our civilization and so it drives everything that every government decides to do.

So @BBCGaryR why didn’t you ask Mr Wood about his previous highly political and false statements during indyref when he claimed Scotland’s oil would run out?
Oh that’s not your job, I see. What exactly is your job?

9560 2018-12-04 09:34:06 Climate change is no scam - the only scamming that is going on is through the lobbing of Governments by big carbon producing industries - Fossil fuels (oil, gas & coal) and manufacturing. They have their eyes fixed on their profit making ability
9561 2018-12-04 09:33:25 @JDLandis1 @ifindkarma Good Yom Tov, gentlemen. I have a chanukah question:
If the oil was running out, we should start with eight candles and end with one. Why do we do the opposite?
9562 2018-12-04 09:33:09 #Liar and his family is one of the RICH 5 fishing families ! He lied about oil in 2014 and he is now lying about being out of EU on Big Treeesas deal #shameful !

9566 2018-12-04 09:32:49 @jjz1600: @BetoORourke took no PAC money. He took individual donations from Texans, many of whom - like the Shell IT guy with whom I knocked doors for him - work in the oil & gas industry. Please correct.

9588 2018-12-04 09:28:50 Whatever subsidy money FG owes oil marketers dates back to May 2015, plus the added accrued cost of foreign exchange differential of that same debt as at when it was incurred. 

NNPC is d sole importer of products &sells to marketers. 

So FG doesn't pay subsidy 2any marketer.
9589 2018-12-04 09:28:43 We are talking about *reducing* the carbon intensity of an oil company. Oxymoronic. Fossil fuels need to be phased out, period. We don't need Shell's geologists globetrotting to look for lighter oil reserves. We need Shell to undertake a controlled decline of their oil operations
9590 2018-12-04 09:28:40 This book can cut oil prices and create a better future. It needs unity, winning, and teamwork. Get it out. I will charge a 1 dollar a copy if seven billion and counting invest in it.
9591 2018-12-04 09:28:33 The sexual harassment claims against this snake oil merchant fraud aside, the animal rights people should be on his case for murdering and skinning two  alligators  in order to make a pair of boats he can wear as shoes. 
9592 2018-12-04 09:28:09 Gold: A few reasons why gold's response to the increase in US growth worries has been more muted are continued strength in the dollar and a sharp fall in oil price which decreased the inflation breakevens.
9593 2018-12-04 09:28:02 That won't change anything... He set up the base for the mass destruction and that is still going on... I already told you that he has to answer for the death of innocents for the sake of oil...

Some say if fossil fuels are killing the planet, employees are complicit & politicians should reject their money.
Extreme?
Today, yes.
But working for tobacco used to be socially ok.
Then, not.
Same with animal experiments, S. Africa apartheid etc.
Oil next?

9618 2018-12-04 09:25:07 Beto voted for offshore drilling and exportation of crude oil. Doesn't work.
9619 2018-12-04 09:24:31 It doesn't. I think all politicians, including Beto and Bernie, should be scrutinised for campaign contributions from the oil and gas industry. The issue is that Beto's receipts are exceptionally high for a nominally democratic party candidate.

9846 2018-12-04 08:53:05 Libtard goverments loves more taxes. In Canada Alberta the libtards introduced carbon tax beginning 2017, now in 2018 they chose train transport for oil above pipeline. Why, could it be the extra tax they get?

9855 2018-12-04 08:51:46 Trump denounced global warming as far back as 2014, he denies climate change as of Nov. 2017.  Trump plausibly sets to treaty with Dubya at George H. Bush's funeral given their chairs in OPEC, Trump wants to see some Big Oil money change w/ Russia & US to further line pockets?

9911 2018-12-04 08:42:10 Don’t agree, unknowable, and I believe the tax cuts and regulation reduction and expanding domestic oil and gas production are strategic for  world  policy and the economy.  None of that was likely with Hillary.  Congress was testing which way the winds were blowing initially.
9912 2018-12-04 08:41:59 Arghhh buratai own, you must serve jail term fighting in the front line
9913 2018-12-04 08:41:46 Yes, when it’s “headline” misrepresents the actual fact. Y’all are being disingenuous here. Many jobs and associations with the oil industry here in Tx-grassroots donors-not Pac $. Your presentation is misleading at best, a calculated lie ar worst.

You let down all your oil buddies cause @Tesla and anyone else who gets into the BEV game is about to crush the ICE and FF industries and perhaps power production also.  Shame that clean coal thing didn't work out for you.  I guess lipstick on pigs doesn't work.
9916 2018-12-04 08:41:20 I'll be happy when gas n oil doesn't exist anymore

9917 2018-12-04 08:41:20 So Qatar is leaving OPEC. Monopolies are usually bad but if they artificially raise oil prices that's good, since burning oil (obviously) has massive harmful effects on society.
9918 2018-12-04 08:41:17 haha there was a thing in the news a few years ago about south east asian people should just be taking vitamin d regardless. It's why I exercise as well, which I can't do at the moment which doesn't help.  (Also Cod liver oil and magneisum)
9919 2018-12-04 08:41:16 Context on Beto’s donations from people who work for companies classified as in the oil & gas industry, and the total he raised with no PAC money:

$429,752 out of $69,100,000 = 0.62%

It was the cops
I’ve never been more embarrassed explaining how I suppressed a bottle of explosive canola oil
9981 2018-12-04 08:30:27 Whenever there's oil or anything of any value to grab
9982 2018-12-04 08:30:18 No one's talking about it, but the solution seems pretty obvious. Subsidized u.s. oil, gas, and coal gasification. After you collapse the energy sector, then make a deal. It would be expensive, but nothing like continuous war and you would have a chance to get internal reforms.
9983 2018-12-04 08:30:06 Nah just throw it in the pot after the Mac n cheese is done. Drain the oil tho lol
9984 2018-12-04 08:30:04 Sorry for the late response Donna, the 95B had an oil leak before it left the depot, a replacement bus was put on but it operated 30 minutes late.
9985 2018-12-04 08:30:03 Financée par l'augmentation des taxes sur l'essence et le gaz oil
9986 2018-12-04 08:29:54 Du arbetar enbart för dina intressen och samma sak när du jobbade så hårt för lundin Oil intressen. "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts"
9987 2018-12-04 08:29:45 Ha!! Same. I'm amusing in my head, and sometimes in writing, but often my speech does not travel at the same speed as my mind, and also add a large dash of anxiety and also introversion  into the mix. Quite the mess really. Like oil and water.
9988 2018-12-04 08:29:43 Subsidy is oil story in Nigeria year in year out when will Nigeria allows any other Nigerian to part take in this oil business Cabar evryday
9989 2018-12-04 08:29:31 Gee let’s see get repaid in oil or let us set up military bases in VZ which would Putin n Xi prefer
9990 2018-12-04 08:29:19 Also got South-Africa’s strategic oil reserves for a real bargain...I am sure it must have been above board, and any resemblance to a quid pro quo is just accidental.

9994 2018-12-04 08:28:44 Well, when you're a congressman from Texas, you're gonna get lots of money from oil.

Just like congressmen from NY/NJ will get lots of Wall Street money and congressmen from Silicon Valley get lots of money from tech.
9995 2018-12-04 08:28:37 ギャンブルよりユメノ優先し始めたら解釈違い起こしそうなオタクです
9996 2018-12-04 08:28:30 Yes, get rid of all men: they are genetically evil and all are potential rapists!!! But who is going to build houses, work as roof tilers, do long-haul truck driving, build oil rigs, install windmills & solar panels, build dams, build bridges, repair all household devices etc.
9997 2018-12-04 08:28:12 All those who used to put butter in cornchaff back in boarding school. 

I hope you’re working in oil and gas now. 
9998 2018-12-04 08:27:34 Really scared. They’ve been on this “big oil Beto” false narrative for over a week now.
9999 2018-12-04 08:27:24 Interesting place...apart from all the fuel oil.
People get a rather unpleasant high from inhaling it for too long.
According to a book I read, it makes the work crews howl like animals.
10000 2018-12-04 08:27:22 It’s down to Global oil prices obviously
10001 2018-12-04 08:27:17 #12daysofchristmas #win day3 congratulations on making this without palm oil and things that destroy our planet
