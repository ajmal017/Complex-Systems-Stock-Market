1 2018-12-17 23:55:07 “Capturing” is such a polite, civilized word.  No hint of predation or exploitation or betraying your customers’ trust by turning them into data commodities you sell on to others.

As your customers’ awareness of your invasion  of their privacy rises, there will be consequences.

4 2018-12-17 23:33:16 Brilhante acho improvável. Talvez uma ano ok. Em geral tem contágio. Se volume/ preço de commodities cair e consumo interno esquentar, é pressão redobrada na balança comercial. Difícil manter juros baixos. Sem falar nas questōes internas, cujas soluçōes estão no plano das ideias.
5 2018-12-17 23:32:56 For me, it’s usually people that deal in more traditional commodities. But I betcha, that 12 yr old has more toughness than that person could dream to have.

8 2018-12-17 23:26:53 Iran is not “Arab” it’s Persian, the money released came from Iranian accounts frozen in the late 70s. But Trump bends for murdering Saudis and Russians, got nothing from N. Korea, and has destroyed the farm commodities markets with his failed Trade War with China. #TrumpIsAMoron
9 2018-12-17 23:26:16 The most innovative & complex company in Africa right now is the Dangote Group. It's a uniquely African story which involves the fusion of logistics, commodities, and government-backed monopoly structure. I wish I had thought of that fusion. I will do a thread on it later.
10 2018-12-17 23:14:01 Sorry, but "justice" isn't a magic word that makes health care commodities no longer subject to supply and demand. That is nothing more than a disastrous fantasy. See Hayek, The Fatal Conceit, Friedman on single-payer, and other authors like Von Mises, Reisman and others.
11 2018-12-17 23:12:39 Vai sonhando fia, isso aqui será apenas uma mera colônia de yankees, só exportar commodities, não passará disso.
12 2018-12-17 23:11:53 Mas o quanto disso já está precificado?
Eu não vejo a bovespa barata. As 3 ações q tenho em carteira estão acima do preço que comprei. Está a menos de 5% do topo histórico.
Mercados ANTECIPAM. Dada a incerteza na China, nos EUA, as commodities, qto o IBOV já antecipou?
13 2018-12-17 23:04:41 Woman, being sold as commodities mostly by women.
14 2018-12-17 22:59:08 Ta caindo commodities, bolsas. 10 anos de dinheiro barato, muita complacência, excesso de recompras,Trump botandopressão no FED. Bon nito não tá .Se fizerem tudo direitinho aqui e o congresso ajudar, pode ser menos pior.
15 2018-12-17 22:55:39 I'm the same. A few zoos in Australia work primarily in conservation and rehabilitation. While I'm still against the practice of animals as entertainment and commodities in larger zoos, I'd like to support conservation parks and rehabilitation zoos where possible.
16 2018-12-17 22:45:36 Agreed. The Fed wasn't aggressive enough in the early years of the recovery, but it's been right to be wary since. I think Taper Tantrum was an effective way to shake the excesses out of commodities and emerging markets. It probably helped keep the expansion going
