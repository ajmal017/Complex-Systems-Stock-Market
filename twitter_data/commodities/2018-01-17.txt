2 2018-01-17 23:49:49 Hahaha gasoline prices can’t be controlled by the govenment. It is high all over the world. With the gas so high it will transfer to our basic commodities. That is why the trucking industries here are interested in electric trucks.

38 2018-01-17 22:26:34 Corrections provoke Purges and are welcomed to  figure out whether our view on crypto is right or wrong. Crypto holding has other underlying reasons different to fiat. Shares or commodities. This is a bet on how we visualize the long term future. It either works out or not.

44 2018-01-17 21:54:46 Could be. The #USD is something to watch as well. It has already broken support at 91 and if it doesn't rally soon, could give a further bid to commodities. #Traders #Stockmarket
45 2018-01-17 21:54:04 It’s more that the government will only accept its own currency in payment of taxes. Legal tender laws have never been sufficient to drive demand for currency. But yes the value of bitcoin and other crypto commodities is predicated on the “dupe a dope” model
46 2018-01-17 21:53:16 Yet another example of capitalism's tendency to transform symbols of political resistance into merchandisable signs and commodities, depriving them of their disruptive potential
47 2018-01-17 21:50:04 Hi Luis, yes indeed! Members can convert between any of our 30+ currencies and commodities.
48 2018-01-17 21:50:04 Yup.  Math based commodities that are only valued by people trying to manipulate the value. 

I hope people treat them like extremely volatile penny stocks and not actual retirement investments. They will go beany baby and ppl will loose homes.
49 2018-01-17 21:33:04 What about a geriatric porno lick where the dentures are used as cockrings? Any interest in those commodities futures?
50 2018-01-17 21:32:43 The issue is many people had never even traded before but threw heaps of money at cryptos (that behave like the most volatile commodities, mind) just to be in on the popular conversation and say “yeah, I’m into cryptos”.
51 2018-01-17 21:25:57 Agricultural commodities like palm oil, soy, pulp & beef are the primary drivers of deforestation & forest degradation while the production is growing to meet the needs of a world population projected to reach 8.2 billion by 2025.
52 2018-01-17 21:21:08 No, it's a new currency competing with all the fiats. $ is already competing with other fiats. All currencies are commodities competing within free market, backed by gov confidence. Crypto derive its value from network effect. In the end, money supply determines the value.
53 2018-01-17 21:16:48 Bitcoin could hit $100,000 in 2018, an analyst who correctly predicted the cryptocurrency's rally at the start of last year told CNBC. That's how Bitcoin reach the top invest in Bitcoin let's keep crypto-currency for the major purchases like real estate crude commodities

58 2018-01-17 20:44:20 Well my portfolio is mostly foreign. From Switzerland to Chile, to Singapore. About 15% is in commodities, Gold & Silver about 7, 8. Basically avoiding US dollars. I gotta say this trade has been doing quite better than the FANGS and DOW. Just add to it really if I can.

64 2018-01-17 20:23:58 Little do people know I did investment research for commodities (write reports on news and gas/oil/shale). Literally every single stock on Hotcopper forums had the same cycle. The problem is that people think it's a unique thing. It's speculative commodity period.
65 2018-01-17 20:21:40 You’re further claiming that Blockchain == Tissue paper. Which is why I made my point about mutable platforms versus immutable commodities. Tissue paper doesn’t evolve. Blockchains do.

69 2018-01-17 19:53:37 They do buy goods and services; however, they did not contribute before they got here.  We profit from Silicon Valley because we have stock in those companies. They are essential COMMODITIES to some of our most profitable industries.
70 2018-01-17 19:52:17 It will end up being an unconventional farm system of sorts.  Those who pan out, will look to go to the big stage and the big programs will benefit from being able to "steal" proven commodities.

74 2018-01-17 19:42:32 @kevinmesserly Bitshares need to hire people specifically to pursue maximum new uses of bitassets. Stocks, commodities & more fiats. I'm thinking, if usdt is pump fuel for btc in a shady way, bitassets as core unmatched utility of bitshares are its pump fuel in a transparent way!
75 2018-01-17 19:35:42 We are not selling recyclables on the commodities market until March with the opening of new Materials Recovery Facility. We do not know how China's tightening regulations will play out, but we anticipate we will have clean bales that will compete well on the global market.
76 2018-01-17 19:31:28 Would probably work well for vast majority of consumer contacts. I would argue that only a tiny minority of contracts require bespoke solutions and manual drafting. For the rest it's standardize > commodities > automate, and voila, we have a smart contract.

Someone's suffering is someone's pleasure.
79 2018-01-17 19:28:52 And then I propounded another development perspective: Native involvement perspective.

Until we start involving the raw materials in our locality in the production of needed commodities, our economy will never grow. And we'd always be slaves..

80 2018-01-17 19:25:53 At @1daywithoutus we defend the principle of freedom of movement, because we don't just regard migrants as commodities but as human beings who make their own choices.  Without freedom of movement it would easier to exploit migrant workers @CarolineLucas @PhilipLegrain
81 2018-01-17 19:21:16 When their FUND was active SOROS & ROGERS went after currencies regularly, they were awesome players in the International Market, making BILLIONS by strangling Countries' currencies till they surrender, probably BEST COIN traders ever.

Rogers was more into commodities, a beast..
82 2018-01-17 19:08:51 Maybe J.D. Martinez's value as a corner slugger isn't what he thinks. So what do we think of the societal value created by John Henry as a commodities trader?
83 2018-01-17 19:01:10 why meet with the advisory board when you are going to privatize the National Park System?-think about all those undeveloped lands and commodities under them that will make some friends of Trump very very rich - and don;t forget the golf course opportunities - Moose love golf

Radical yes yet better than socialism
88 2018-01-17 18:48:57 The only example I know where that's sort of the case is single stock futures where the SEC and CFTC agreed to regulate jointly. Certain securities (GLD) that hold commodities or commodity futures are still themselves securities.

94 2018-01-17 18:30:40 No objection here; Jake points out that your beta is >1 though and moreover, your return in general in commodities compares with equities and TIPS' return compares with bonds so different risk/reward decision. Happen to think TIPS very cheap right now though.
95 2018-01-17 18:29:36 Norris said he his org supports amendments to make SB 26 better:

>Delaying Change until July 2019
96 2018-01-17 18:29:07 Look at US trade position before and after 1971. You will see exactly what I am talking abt. China runs a surplus with rest of the world. Countries will hold CNY so they can BUY from China. And as commodities start to trade in CNY, buy from other countries.

98 2018-01-17 18:24:22 "We" can do anything we like but if you want to make any real progress I submit we need to start acknowledging that there is more to this dynamic than men behaving badly. Sex has been commoditized and our society teaches us ALL how to value/obtain commodities.
99 2018-01-17 18:23:57 My 2 cents...

You also get real rate exposure (that hasn’t always worked out so well). Though I personally like TIPS > nominal Treasuries.

Also much less bang for your buck... you get an inflation beta of 1 vs much > 1 for commodities or commodity equities.
100 2018-01-17 18:23:07 STHU! You ppl are so repulsive. How can you stand yourselves? You have made commodities of ppl, profits off wars, & mockery of the rule of law. I do not envy your fate if you do not change your ways. It's never too late. #WeThePEOPLE are taking back our country, w/ or w/o you!
101 2018-01-17 18:21:29 They are not commodities they are sentient creatures who deserve a better life.Two mins could have explained a lot.
102 2018-01-17 18:19:11 Agreed, but since they already deemed Bitcoin/others to be commodities, putting related derivatives within their domain (as opposed to equities), they can seek to apply this standard to the spot markets. Doesn't matter that you can take delivery, rather that it's not automatic.
103 2018-01-17 18:18:28 It's a global world. Some commodities, actually many, are priced almost the same wherever you are in the world. Apart from rent and food, what else can the Nigerian minimum wage cover?
104 2018-01-17 18:11:09 A basket of commodities, including gold, would be more likely.
105 2018-01-17 18:08:05 El tipo de automatización debe ir en función del activo. No es lo mismo FX que Futuros que commodities.

109 2018-01-17 18:00:50 IMO If I go for one year and was miserable I'd rather transfer immediately and sit out a year than have to wait. I think 2 years defeats the purpose f the legislation NCAA has long treated athletes like commodities

112 2018-01-17 17:55:03 The Cardinals front office is similarly frustrating. STL teams really overvalue unproven commodities.
113 2018-01-17 17:54:02 Not going to happen.  Illegal immigrants are considered commodities for lower wage jobs by a lot of big corporations.  The immigrant issue has been "broken" for a while for a reason.

119 2018-01-17 17:35:16 In fact it's like the reverse of the Industrial Revolution. Moving all the 'poorer' people OUT of the centre of cities and leaving the ones in the centre as empty 'investment in futures commodities'. Except then the houses being built aren't for the 'poorer' at all.
120 2018-01-17 17:27:48 Not really, commodities outperformed S&P 500 second half of 2017. Gundlach just said they'll do the same in 2018. Finally, if you don't like our research no one is making you read it.

123 2018-01-17 17:20:19 Yes, the narrative that There Is No Alternative to stocks is about to crash into a wall. Commodities have been outperforming stocks for a while.

128 2018-01-17 17:00:13 yeah I hate the people who act like if they were GM they would treat the players like commodities and do this and that without any regard to relationships with players/GMs/agents, etc.
129 2018-01-17 16:58:55 Very possible. That is why I am on the sidelines until the 8-day breaks back above the 21-day.  Next leg of the Commodity Cycle could begin at any moment, however I fear if we have another 2008 melt down, commodities would hit a lower low.
130 2018-01-17 16:57:42 This is the epitome of the age-old dynasty debate of proven dudes vs unknown commodities. If I’m offered the 1.01 for Kamara, I have to at least wait and see where Barkley gets drafted before I pull the trigger
131 2018-01-17 16:51:22 If you own commodity exposed equities you have commodity beta, equity beta, and a cross term. If you don’t hedge the equity beta you are basically long the S&P with a kicker for commodities spot prices. Don’t get rebal effect, or collateral return. (Cont)>>

133 2018-01-17 16:49:22 These immigrants are not commodities! They are not things to trade. They cannot engage in dehumanizing their compatriots like this. ES GOV needs a reminder that they're talking about human beings!
134 2018-01-17 16:48:36 What are your thoughts on accessing “inflation beta” directly through commodities vs a carve out to commodity exposed equities?
135 2018-01-17 16:40:58 La Chine, qui depuis longtemps a misé sur l'accumulation de commodities stratégiques (métaux rares etc), reprendra tôt ou tard une attitude favorable vis-à-vis des #Cryptoassets en permettant à ses citoyens d'en accumuler aisément.
136 2018-01-17 16:40:52 And that depends on your 3 year plan. If you proper commodities you get help that, you take them. But you have to insist on things up front.
But if people offer 5th & 7ths and "C" prospects? Why bother? You could get that for the opportunity to sign them prior to the deadline.
137 2018-01-17 16:37:27 The key to the dollar’s reserve role is not that most commodities are priced in dollars or that trade, even when the US is not a party, is often conducted in US dollar.  The key is the deep and liquid bond market.
138 2018-01-17 16:36:46 From what I heard, basic commodities & toiletries are tax-free. If there's any, it's only minimal. And anything you consume that grows on land & comes from under the sea are exempted. Processed goods are also only minimally taxed
139 2018-01-17 16:34:29 @SenatorLeahy Pls research & do a segment on how #Trump in violation of Dodd-Frank is allowing banks to use customer funds to buy physical commodities again, like oil. which has driven the price of oil up 50% which brings more income to Russia that blunts sanctions against Russia

141 2018-01-17 16:28:27 Doesn’t matter. We’re gonna get whoever is in the scrap heap. Remember, Warner and Palmer were not hot commodities when we took them. It’s the way of the “No Respect” Cardinals. Hopefully whoever it is works out as well as they did.

166 2018-01-17 15:42:10 Objectifying other human beings is a destructive form of idolatry. When we view others simply as bodies/commodities of any (or no) value, we are deconstructing the divine image in whom they were created.

I also think the BOC's economic forecasts for CPI / GDP were encouraging. $CAD should intuitively strengthen. Should be bullish for #commodities & #markets.
169 2018-01-17 15:30:02 All the crptocurrencies are depreciating due to dollar's weakness while all the commodities and currencies are rising. This means that crptocurrencies are not money, they are only frenzy which exchange upon dollar's worth.

174 2018-01-17 15:15:41 When animal agriculture claims to be 'kind', 'humane' and to 'care' for animals, this relates to either a legal definition or simply care that maximises the value of animals as commodities.
